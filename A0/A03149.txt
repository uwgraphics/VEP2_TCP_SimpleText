TO THE MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE, CHARLES, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and
York, Earl of Chester, etc.
SIR,
ACtion is the life of a Prince; speculation of a Scholar. In this you have
been truly your self, and have in person made it good: whereof we shall
enjoy the benefit, posterity the story. Those parts which other Princes have
visited only in a Map, you have honored with your own survey; and seen more,
then they have read. To your Highness therefore, as the greatest and best
accomplished traveler; do I here present, what by speculation I have attained
unto: my Little World made bigger. Not that I presume to inform you, in any
thing you know not; or confirm you in any thing you doubt. I am too sensible
of mine own defects, to conceive impossibilities. Only I desire, that under
your G^^cious protection others may peruse it, whom God has made no less your
inferiors in knowledge, then greatness. Such, perhaps, it may both delight,
and satisfy: to your Highness it can do no other service, then to set forth
the luster of your own most judicious observations. If I have any ambition
beyond this, it is but to express the zeal I bear to the true renown of
your Princely virtues: and the affection, duty, and reverence, wherewith in all
humility I subscribe my self

Your Highness most humbly deuote^. PET: HEYLYN.

TO THE READER.
RObora parentum liberi indicant. The growth of the children (...) the strength
of the parent. For this cause the warlike nation of the Germans, ordained* that
^^^riage should be delaied in their young men, and not hastened in their
Virgins. Had I observed that due proportion of age, in begetting the issue of
my bra^^e, which they did in the issue of their bodies: perhaps it had not now
needed a second generation, nor I a second delivery. The wants and weaknesses,
with which this my Firstborn came burdened into the world; I desire may be
imputed to the nonage of his parent, and the vntimelinesse of his birth; either
a defect sufficient to cause an abortion. I have lately (good Reader)
new-begotten him, and brought him to that strength and stature thou now soest.
I am not the first of whom it was said, secundae cogitationes sunt meliores:
neither is it a thing rare for children of this nature, to be as often
perfected, as borne. Books have an immortality above their Authors. They, when
they are full of age, and guiltiness, can be re-taken into the womb which
bred them: and with a new life, receive a greater portion of youth and glory.
Every impression is to them another being: and that always may, and often does
bring with it, a sweeter addition of strength and loveliness. Thus with them,
age, and each several death, is but an usher to a new birth: each several
birth the mother of a more vigorous perfection. The truth is, in my former
Edition of this work, I dealt with petty chapmen, pedlers of History and
Geography: wit i^ them I took up my faults upon trust; and had a happiness
which some want; authority for mine Errors. N^w a three years addition of
age, and a little of judgment; has brought me acquainted with elder reading,
Merchants of the best sort: according to whose helps I have augmented and
reuised my former trauells.

At the first, there went to the making up of this Little world, these six
integrall parts, History, Geography, Policy, Theology, Chronology, and
Heraldrie. It is now enlarged in all those particulars, and in nothing is
deficient which the other did afford thee, but the faults. To these I have upon
diverse occasions added diverse Philologicall discourses; not much impertinent
to the places, wherein they are inferred. At the worst, thou can but call
them Digressions; I am sure they are not Extrauagancies. Digred^ nos patimur,
non diuagar^, says Tully.

These additions and corrections have swelled the volume bigger then I
expected: yet if to thee the l^ngth of it be not offensive; to me it shall not.
It is now come to a just growth, and has received my last hand. Hereafter I
will look on it, only as a stranger. Thou needst not fear any future
enlargements, which may make thee repent thy present markets. I have now given
over these younger studies; and, believe me, 'twas more then time: for I gazed
so long on the porch, that I had almost forgotten to go into the house. If
ever I am induced to look further into it, it shall be only to amend such
crimes, whereof a cleerer judgment then mine own can inform me. For my part,
I see not any: and when thou have by the Errata corrected the Copy: I dare
almost persuade my self, thou will (for material faults I mean) pronounce
it, not guilty. Yet I exempt not my self from the common frailty of nature;
possibility of erring. It Is a misery from which his Holiness, even when he
sits on his very Porphyry chair, is not privileged. When by the strength
of mine own judgment, or any ingenuous information, I am convicted: I will at
once confess my oversight, and mend it.

Thus have I laid before thee, as in a Map, all that I have performed, in this
new creation of this Little world: in which I have equally endeavored thy
good, and mine own credit. To petition thy good opinion of my labors, is a
thing infinitely below me. This were rather to extort commendation, then
deserve it. Such requests are punished in themselves; and need no wretchedness
without them. The favors they aim at, have somewhat in them, common to
ignoble quarrels, vbi and vincere inglorium est; and atteri, sordidum: and are
not more infamous in the denial, then the suit. A modest and voluntary
acknowledgment of my industry, I would gladly entertain; but not invite.
Guests of this quality, when they bid themselves, bring with them their own
welcome. When they come upon entreatie, they come unwillingly: and are not then
received, but ravished. Good Reader, judge of me, as thou find me worthy:
for my self, I am neither ambitious of applause, nor afraid of censure. Give
me leave so far to be mine own para^^s^ as to flatter my pains, in the
words and hope of Tacitus: hic interim liber, aut laudatus erit, aut saltem
excusatus. Farewell.

TO MY BROTHER the Author.
THy first-prest Grapes did yield approved Wine,
Such as did praise it self: yet to indeere
Our approbation, thou do here refine
Those former Fruits; and for our better Cheer*
Presents us with a pure and stronger Vine:
Lest else some curious taste might it distaste;
If so, what needs my second Bush? It Is wast.
Yet well thy choice Minerua merits this
This Ivie-garland, everlasting green;
Which like the Graces cup proportiond is,
Where-out thou drink'st, wherein their Liquours been.
Nor would thou escape the lash of Nemesis,
If with Diogenes thou should refuse
To let the thirsty drink there-hence, 'Twere news.
Thy Book's an Arc, which all the World contains,
And well may bear a short Encomion.
It Is slender Meede, yet who such pay disdaines?
Good wine may have a Bush, though it need none.
Nor let these lines of mine seem partial strains:
Thy Work ingenuous is: and Virtues brood,
As it, increases with due praise. It Is good.
Much time it cost; much cost, and labor more.
Fames breath is dear: it is hard to purchase Praise.
The Muses seat ascend^ an hundred score:
And Honors journey lies not in plain ways.
Who to Pernassus bi-crownd top will soar,
Must with elaborate quill climb up: and such
Thy tender Genius boasts thee. It Is much.
Too much it were indeed, but that in part
The Guerdon of well-doing, is the doing.
Fame and Reward but wait upon thine Art;
Which yet deserves that in this forward going,
Thy Fortune^ may euen-ballance thy Desert.
But Fortune's base, and sells the Wages due
To Worth, unto her Favorites. It Is true.
The Earth thy ground-plot is Geographide;
Kings sometimes are thy Subjects peopling it;
Thy story History has beautified,
Penned by the vigor of an homebred wit:
Whose art has trauell'd all the world beside.
And can of every Country well declare
The occurrents, nature, site, and bounds. It Is rare.
Thus that the earth so Young thou compast have,
It Is rare, true, much, good, news: and my praise wast.

THE GENERAL PRAECOGNITA OF GEOGRAPHIE.
GEOGRAPHIE is (according to Ptolomey) an imitation of the picture of the whole
Earth. But since the method I intend to follow cannot be confined within the
limits of this brief definition, it is requisite I should propose another of
more large extent, which may be correspo^dent to my purpose. Which before I
will here set down, I will briefly explane certain Geographicall notions, and
rehearse some of her general Praecognita. And since Ovid has given me so
exact a method, I cannot but make use of it. The words are these with some
little alteration. Met. lib. 2.

Terra, viros, vrbesque gerit frugesque ferasque,
Fluminaque haec super est coelifulgentis imago.
The earth bears men, Cities, Fruits, Beasts, and Floods,
Over which hang's Heaven adorned with glittering studs.
TERRA.
We take not the earth simply in its own nature as it is an element, for so it
belongs to Philosophy, but for the terrestrial Globe: so it is the subject
of Geographie, and is defined to be a Sphericall body, proportionably composed
of earth, and water.

The EARTH, is by the best writers* and among them by P^^cer, concluded to be
21600 miles in compass; who withal conjecture, that if there were a path made
round the earth, a nimble footman might easily go it in 900 days.

K^^k^rm.
The earth is divided in respect of us men into the Right hand. Left hand.
In respect of it self into parts Real. Imaginary.



To Poets which turn their faces toward the Fortunate Islands (so often by them
memorized) which are situate in the West; the North is the right hand; the
South the left.

To Astronomers which turn their faces toward the South, because from that
coast come the influences, and thence are observed the motions of the Planets;
the West is the right hand, the East the left.

To Geographers, who by reason of their observations of the elevation of the
Pole, turn their faces toward the North; the East is the right hand, the West
the left.

To Augures (of old) and (in our days) to Ministers who usually at their
sacrifices and prayers turn their faces toward the East; the South is the
right hand, the North the left.

The real parts are either Continents. Islands.


A Continent is a great quantity of land, not separated by the Sea, in which
many kingdoms and principalities are confined, and conjoined.

An Island (called in Latin Insula, quasi in salo) is a part of the earth
environed round with waters, as Britain, Corsica, etc.

As for the Continent I have nothing in particular to illustrate: But for
Islands (leaving the disputation of their being or not being before the Flood)
there are four causes to which they owe their original; L. Gui^ciar^^^^.
1. An Earthquake, which works two ways; viz. when by it one part of a
country is forcibl^ rent from the other; So was Euboea severed from the maine
land of Attica: or when some vehement and strong wind, or pi^it being shut in
the ^arth, which is under the Sea, raileth, and as it were thrusts up the
resisting ground; to which cause such Islands as are remote from any continent,
must refer their b^ginnings. 2. Great Rivers at their entry into the Sea carry
with them abundance of gravel, dirt, and weeds; which, if the sea be not the
more working, will in time settle to an Island. So the corn which Tarquinius
sowed in the Campus Martius, being cut down by the people and cast into Tiber,
settled together and made the holy Island: So the river Achelous caused he Each
nades, as anon we shall more at large declare. 2. The sea violently beating on
some small Istmus, wears it through, and turns the Peninsula into a
complete Isle. Thus was Sicili^ divided from Italy, Cyprus from Syria, England
from France, and Wight from the rest of England. And 4^v, sometimes as it
eats and works on some places, so it voluntarily leaves and abandon^th
others, which in time grow to be Islands, and firm land under foot. So it is
thought that the Isles of Zeland have been once p^rt of the maine Sea.
Verstogan.
And it is proved, because that the husbandmen in tilling and manuring the
ground, find sometimes Anchors here and there fixed, but very often the bones
of huge and great fishes, which could by no other accident come thither. To
the^e kind of Islands Pythagoras in Ovid alluding says, -- vidi factas ex
aequoreterras,
Et procul a pelago conchae iac^ere marinae,
Et v^tus inventa est in montibus anchora summis. Ovid. Met.

O^ have I seen that earth, which once I knew
Part of the Sea: so that a man might view
Huge shells of fishes in the vpland ground,
And on the mountains tops old anchors found.
As concerning the situation of Islands, whether commodious or not, this is my
judgment. I find in Machiauell, that for a City whose people covet no Empire
but their own towns, a barren place is better then a fruitful, because in
such seats they are compelled to work and labor, by which they are free from
idleness, and by consequence from vitiousnesse: but for a city whose
inhabitants desired to enlarge their confines, a fer^^le place was more to be
chosen then a sterile; as being more able to nourish multitudes of people. The
like I say of Islands. If a Prince desire rather to ke^pe then augment his
Dominions, no place sitter for his abode then an Island, as being by it se^fe
and nature sufficiently defensible: But if a king be minded to add continually
unto his Empire, an Island is no fit seat for him; because partly by the
uncertainty of winds and seas, partly by the longsomenesse of the ways, he is
not so well able to supply and keep such forces as he has on the continent. An
example hereof is England, which has even to admiration repelled the most
puissant Monarch of Europe; but for the causes above named cannot show any of
her winnings on the firm land, though she has attempted and achieved as
many glorious exploits as any country in the world.

The Continent and Island are subdivided into Peninsula. Istmus. Prom^ntorium.


Peninsula, quasi pene insula, is a tract of land, which being almost
encompassed round by water, is joined to the firm land by some little Istmus:
as Pelopon^esus, Tauriea, and Per^ana.

Istmus, is that little narrow neck of land which joins the Peninsula to the
Continent, as the straights of Dariene in Peru, and Corinth in Greece.

Promontorium, is a high mountain which shoots it self into the Sea, the
outmost end of which, is called a Cape, as the Cape of good hope in Afric,
etc.

The other real parts of the earth, as Mountains, Valleys, Fields, Plains,
and the like, I will not stand to define, since they are known even to infants.

The Imaginary parts of the earth are such, which not being at all in the
earth, must yet be supposed to be so, for the better teaching and learning this
science; and are certain circles going about the earth answerable to them in
heaven in name.

K^^k^r^s.
These circles are either the Greater Lesser
in both which there are 360 degrees, which in the greater circles are greater
then those in the lesser; and every degree in the greater is 60 miles.

The greater circles are either Immutable as the Equator. Mutable as the
Meridian. Horizon.



The Equator is a greater circle going round about the terrestrial Globe from
East to West. It passes through Habassia, Sumatra, and Guiana. The use of it
is to show the latitude of any Town, Promontory, etc. Now the latitude is the
distance of a place, South or North from the Equator or middle of the world;
and must be measured by the degrees in the Meridian.

The Meridian is a greater circle rounding the earth from pole to pole. There
are many Meridians according to the diverse place in which a man lives, but
the chief and first Meridian passes through the Islands called Azores. The use
of it is to show the longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a city,
Cape, etc. is the distance of it East and West from the first Meridian, and is
usually measured by the degrees of the Equator.

The Horizon is a greater circle, designing so great a space of the earth, as a
quick sight can ken in an open field. The use of it is to discern the diverse
risings and settings of the stars.

The lesser circles either are Noted with some name as Tropicall of Cancer. of
Capricorn.
Polare, either Articke. Antarticke.

Noted with no name, and are the Paralels.


The Tropicke of Cancer (so called of the celestial sign Cancer) is distant
from the Aequinoctiall 23 degrees northward, and passes through Barbary,
India, China, and Noua Hispania.

The Tropic of Capricorn equally distant from the Equator southward, passes
through Aethiopia inferior, and the midst of Peruana. And this is to be
observed in these Tropickes, that when the sun is in the Tropicke of Cancer,
our days are at the longest; and when he is gone back to the Tropicke of
Capricorn, the days are at the shortest: the first they call the Summer, the
last the Winter solstice; the first happening on St Barnabies day in June: the
last on St Lucies in December.

The Articke circle (so called, for that it is correspondent to the circle in
heaven called the Bear, in Greek Arct^s) is distant from the Tropicke of
Cancer 45 degrees; it passes through Norway, Muscovie, Tartarie, etc.

The Antarticke circle (because opposite to the other) is as much distant from
the Tropicke of Capricorn, and passes through Terra australis incognita. The
use of these four circles is to describe the Zones.

Dodon^us
The Zones are spaces of earth, included betwixt two lesser circles. They are in
number five, one ouer-hot, two ouer-cold, and two temperate.

The ouer-hot, or Torrid Zone, is betwixt the two Tropickes, and continually
scorched with the presence of the Sun.

The two ouer-cold, or Frigid Zones, are situate between the two Polare circles
and the very Poles, continually wanting the neighborhood of the Sun.

The two temperate Zones, are betwixt the Tropic of Cancer and the Articke;
and twixt the Tropicke of Capricorn and the Antarticke circles; enjoying an
indifferency between heat, and cold: so that the parts next the Torrid Zone
are the hotter; and the parts next the Frigid Zone are the colder.

These five Zones are disposed according to the order of the Zones in heaven.

Ovid. Met.
Vtque duae dextrae coelum, totidomque sinistra
Part s^cant zonae, quinta est ardentior illis:
Sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem
Cura Dei, totidemque plagae tellure premuntur.
Quaerum quae media est, non est habitabilis aest^;
Nix tegit alta duas; totidem inter vtramque locauit,
Temperiemque dedit mista cum frigore flamma.
And as two zones do cut the heavens right side,
And likewise other two the left divide;
The midst in heat exc^eding all the rest:
Even so it seemed to the Creator best,
That this our world should so divided be,
That with the heavens in Zones it might agree*
The midst in heat, the outward most in cold
Exceed, and none to dwell in them are bold,
Betwixt these two extremes, two more are fixed,
Where heat with cold indifferently is mixed.
K^ckerm.
Parallels called also Aequidistants, circle the earth from East to West, and
are commonly ten degrees asunder. Such are the Parallels which are set down
in our Mappes and Globes. But there are another sort of Parallels, two of which
go to a Clime. These are called Artificial Paralels, because they show the
differences of the artificial days. They are of unequal breadth, as you
shall see in the table following. The vfe of these latter Parallels, is to show
the Climats.

A Clime is a space of the earth comprehended between two Parallels, or three
lesser innominate circles: they serve to distinguish the length and brevity of
the days in all places. For under Equator, the days are of the just length
of twelve hours; but after, in every clime they increase the length of hal^e
an home, so that there are numbered 48 Parallels, or 24 Climats before the days
extend to 24 hours of length; which once attained, they increase by weeks and
months, until they come to the length of half a year: we therefore are to
reckon 24 climats Northward, and as many Southward. The climes toward the north
were formerly known by the peculiar names, as Di^ M^roes, Dia Sienes, etc. and
the climes toward the South by the same names, only with the addition of Anti,
as Anti Dia Meroes, and Anti Dia Sienes. Indeed the ancient Cosmographers made
but 7 Climes, and some 9; neither needed they to add more, since they knew
not the extent of the habitable world toward each Pole, so exactly as now we
do.

Now because the climes are not of an equal latitude or extent, for which
cause it is impossible to comprehend the nature of them in any rules general
or particular: I have inserted this ensuing Table, taken partly out of Clanius
on Sacrobosco; and partly out of Mr Hues discourse of the use of the Globes. It
is divided into 7 columns. In the first is showed what climes are inhabited by
the Amphiscij, Heteroscij, and Periscij terms which we will presently
expound: In the second is set down the number of the climes themselves. In the
third the number of the Parallels. In the fourth the length of the days in
summer. In the fifth the distance of every Climat and Parallel from the
Equator. In the sixth, the breadth and extent of every climat in it self. And
in the seventh, the name of the place through which the midst of the three
circles, whereof every clime consists, does pass.

*Page 7. The Table of the Climes.

The second part of the terrestrial Globe is the WATER, which making together
with the earth but one Globe, is yet in situation higher then it. This is
apparent, 1. Because it is a body not so heavy. 2. It is observed by Sailors,
that their ships fly faster to the shore then from it; whereof no reason can
be given, but the height of the water above the land. 3. To such as stand on
the shore, the Sea seems to swell into the form of an hill, till it puts
a bound to their sight. That the Sea houe^ing thus over the earth does not
ouerwhelme it, must be attributed to him only, Who has made the waters to
stand on a heap, who has set them a bound which they shall not pass, nor
turn again to cover the earth. The other affections or properties of Sea, as
motion, saltness, and the like, I willingly omit, as pertaining rather to
Philosophers.

The SEA or WATER is divided into 1. Oceanus, 2. Mare, 3. ^retum, 4. Sinus.


Oceanus, the Ocean, is that general collection of all waters, which
environeth the world on every side, according to that of the Poet in his
Metamorphosis, lib. 1.

Tum freta diffudit, rapidisque tumescere ventis
Iussit, and ambitae circund we littora terrae:
He spread the Seas, which then he did command
To swell with winds, and compass round the land.
Mare, the Sea, is a part of the Ocean, to which we cannot come but through
some straight, as Mar^ Mediterraneum.

These two take their names, Either from the adjacent places, as the British
Ocean, the Carpathian Sea. Or from the first discouerer, as Mare Magellanicu^.
Or from some remarkable accident, as Mare Rubrum, from the color of Sands,
etc.


Fretum, a straight, is a part of the Ocean restrained within narrow bounds,
and opening a way to the Sea: as the Streights of Gibralter, Hellespont, etc.

Sinus, a creek or Bay, is a crooked shore, thrusting out (as it were) two
arms, to embrace the lovely presence of the Sea: as Sinus Persicus, or
Corinthiacus.

VIROS.
The Earth thus being described, it is necessary we should speak somewhat of
the Lord of the Soil, viz. Man; who was created last of all, as that creature
in whose constitution the perfections of all the rest were united. This Epitome
of the great Volume of Nature, borrows from the Angels soul, from the brute
Animals sense, from Plants life, from other creatures bigness: and above all
inferiors is endowed with this prerogative, Pronaque cum spectent animalia
catera terram, Meta. lib. 1.

Os homini sublime dedit, coelumque videre
Iussit, and erectos ad sydera tollere vultus.
And where all beasts look down with groueling eye,
He gave to man looks mix't with Majesty,
And willed him with bold face to view the Sky.


Men thus one by original, are of diverse complexions of body, and conditions
of mind, according to the diverse climates of the Earth.

O see how full of wonders strange is Nature, Du. Bar^.

Since in each climate, not alone in stature,
Strength, color, hair; but that men differ do
Both in their humors, and their manners too.
The Northern man is fair, the Southern foul,
That Is white, this black; that smiles, and this does scoule.
Th'ones blithe and frolic, th'other's dull and froward*
Th'ones full of courage, the other a fearful coward, etc.
The Northern man is more strong, the Southern more politic; the Northern
more able, and the Southern more covetous of veneriall combats, etc. Men also
are (according as they are treated of in Geographie) divided either in respect
of their shadow, Dodonaeus.
into Amphiscij, Periscij, Heteroscij: or in respect of their site and
habitation, into Antocci, Perioeci, and Antipodes.

Amphiscij are such as dwell between the two Tropickes, so called, because
their shadows tend both ways: sometimes, (when the Sun is North) to the
South; sometimes (when the Sun is South) to the North*

P^riscij are such as dwell beyond the Polare Circles, so called, because their
shadows are on all sides of them.

Heteroscij are such as dwell in either of the two temperate Zones; so called,
because their shadows reach but one way; viz. in our Zone to the North only,
in the other to the South only.

Antoeci are such as dwell under the same Meridian, and the same Latitude or
parallel, equally distant from the Equator: the one Northward, the other
Southward; the days in both places being of a length; but the ones Summer
being the others Winter.

Perioeci are such as dwell in the same parallel, on the same side of the
Equator, how distant soever they be East and West; the season of the year,
and the length of days being to both alike, and the ones midnight, the others
noone.

Antipodes are such as dwell* feet to feet, so as a right line drawn from the
one unto the other, passes from North to South through the center of the
world. These are distant ^80 degrees, which is half the compass of the earth.
They differ in all things, as seasons of the year, length of days, rising and
setting of the Sun, with the like.

In the men moreover we will consider Religion (being the soul of life, and
the life of the Soul) then their dispositions and customs.

VRBES.
We have brought man into the world, and cannot but afford him house-roome;
which at first was very mean and unfurnished: for so says Ovid, M^t. 1.

-- Domus a trafuerunt,
Et densi fiutices, and iuncta cortice v^rga.
Their houses were but hollow caves, and thickes
Of bushie heaths, and hurdles made of sticks.
Many of these houses joined together, made a Vi^us or street; two or three
Vici made a Pagus, or Borough; and two or three Pagi a Town or City; of whose
magnificence and greatness, Boterus assigns many causes, we will only
rehearse the principal.

1. First then there is required to the magnificence of a city, a navigable
river, or easy passage by Sea; by which there may be a continual concourse of
all kind of Merchants, as now at Venice, Amsterdam, London, Constantinople. 2.
The Palace of the Prince; for Vbi Imperator, ibi Roma, and where the Court is,
there will continually be store of young Nobles to buy, and Tradesmen to sell
usual commodities: as now Madrid in Spain, grown from a mean Village, to a
populous City, only by the Kings Court. 3. The residence of the Nobility which
raises a City with stately and beautiful buildings: hence the Cities of Italy
excel ours, their Nobles and Gentry still living in the Cities, ours in the
Villages, and private houses. 4. The Seat or Tribunal of Justice, which
inuiteth Lawyers and their Clients in abundance, to the great enriching of a
City; as the Parliamentarie Cities in France do evidently testify, and Spiers
in Germany. 5. Public schools of good literature, which summon the youth of
the adjoining Countries (as it were) to make their personal appearance, to the
great benefit of a town, as Paris well knows, and other towns have felt.
6. Immunities from taxes and the like oppressions, which draw men from all
quarters to inhabit there; their income being in such places greatest, their
privileges most, and disbursing least; as in Naples, Florence, and Venice:
which being almost desolate by a plague, were again very suddenly peopled, by
granting immunities to all comers. 7. Opinion of Sanctity, whether it be for
relickes of Saints, for holy shrines, for the residence of some famous man, or
for the seat of Religion, is not the least benefit for the enriching and
enlarging of a city: people (I mean the superstitious Papists) gr^edily
hunting after these sights and novelties. Thus the Relics at Aken and T^^ers,
the pilgrimages to St Iago and Lore^to, the habitation of that famous Cardinal
Boromeo at Millaine, and the seat of the Popes at Rome have bin the cause that
the first cities have bin much beautified, the last not ruined. So in former
times there came so many from the farthest coasts of France and Spain unto
Rome to see Titus Liviu^* that St Hierome elegantly says, En Praefat. ad
Biblia.
Quos ad sui contemplationem Roma non traxerat, unius huius hominis fama
perduxit: qui iam urbem tantam ingressi, aliud extra urbem quaererent.
There are many other secundarie causes, as commodity of conduct, pleasantness
of site, fruitfulness of soil, and the like; which much further the
populousness, riches, and flourishing beauty of Cities.

For a general example we need not go far. Worcester has a pleasant site,
and fruitful soil, Bristoll a commodious Haven, Oxford is a famous
University, and York is a seat of Justice; yet are all but of a mean
compass. But London having all the requisite conditions, lifts up a head of
majesty as high above the rest, as the Cypress trees above the low shrubbes.

FRVGES.
Our most provident and glorious Creator, so furnished Countries with several
commodities, that amongst all there might be sociable conversation; and one
standing in need of the other, all might be combined in a common league, and
exhibit mutual succors.

Bart. Col.
Hence come our Sugars from Canary Isles, From Candie Currants, Muskadels and
Oils: From the Moluccoes Spices: Balsamum From Egypt: Odours from Arabia
come; From India Gums, rich drugs and Ivorie: From Syria Mummie: black red
Ebonie From burning Chu^: from Peru Pearl and Gold: From Russia Furs to keep
the rich from cold: From Florence silks: from Spain fruit, Saffron, Sackes:
From Denmark Amber, Cordage, Firres, and Flax: From Flaunders and France,
Linen, Wood, and Wine: From Holland Hoppes: Horse from the banks of Rhine:
From England Wool: All Lands, as God distributes, To the worlds treasure pay
their sundry tributes.
This abundance of all countries in every thing, and defect of every Country in
most things, maintains in all Regions, and every Province, a most strict
combination. So that as in the body of the little world, the head cannot say to
the foot, nor the foot to the head, I stand in no need of thee: so in the body
of the great world, Europe cannot say to Asia, or Asia to Africa, I want not
your commodities, or am defective in that, of which thou boasts of an
abundance.

FERAS.
Nature never showed her self so exact a mistress in her art, as in the
framing and moulding up that infinite number of strange and unheard of Beasts,
the rehearsal of whom, though not necessary, yet cannot but be ornaments unto
a Geographicall Treatise, and are (as it were) a dressing and tricking up
Nature in her Holy Day colors.

FLVMINA.
Rivers are said to be engendered in the hollow concauities of the Earth,
Magirus.
and derive both their birth and continual sustenance from the Air; which
penetrating the open chinks or Chasma's of the Earth, and congealed by the
extreme cold of that Element, dissolues into water (as we see the Air in
Winter nights to be melted into a pearlie dew, sticking on our glass windows)
and being grown to some quantity, will) like Annibal in the Alps) either find
a way, or make a way to vent its superfluity. This beginning is seconded by the
Ocean, which running through the hidden passages of the Earth, joyneth it self
with this aeriall vapor, and continues the begun current. This Seawater
(though in it self of a salt and brackish savor, yet passing through diverse
windings and turnings of the Earth, is deprived of all vnpleasantnes: and by
how much the Spring-heads of rivers are remote from the Sea, by so much are
their waters affected with a delightful relish. Rivers having thus entered
themselves in a good course, are never without the assistance of neighboring
springs and rivers, by whose addition they augment their waters, till they
dischannell themselves into the Sea. Now there is of rivers a treble use.
First, that out of them, drink may be afforded to man and beast. Secondly, that
running through the Earth, as blood through the body, by interlacing it, and
sometimes ouerwhelming it, it might make the Earth able to produce those fruits
which are necessary for the life of man. The last use of rivers is easiues and
speedines of conduct, and hereto are required four conditions. First the
depth; because deep waters sustain the bigger burdens, and on them navigation
is more safe. Secondly pleasantnes, whereby the passage is easy both with the
stream and against it; whereas in rivers of a violent current, or in such as
fall down by great locks or cataracts, the sailing or towing up the water is as
dangerous, as laborious. Thirdly, the thicknes of the water; for by how much
the more slimie and gross a water is, by so much can it carry the heavier
burdens. So Tiber a river of more fame then depth, or breadth, is better for
navigation by reason of its fatnes, then the pure and thin waters of the
large and excellent river Nilus, Fourthly, the broadnes of the channel, that
ships and other vessels may conveniently wind and turn, and give way to each
other. Some of the old Philosophers reputed this conduct so dangerous, that one
of them being asked, whether the living or the dead were the greater number,
would not answer, because he knew not in which rank to place such as were at
Sea. And Cato Mayor thought that men never committed greater folly in their
lives, then in venturing to go by water, when they might have gone by land. I
am none of that sect, yet I cannot but hold with him that said, dulcissima est
ambulatio prope aquas navigatio iuxta terram.

The chief rivers of Europe are Danubius and the Rhene; of Africa, Nilus and
Niger; of Asia, Ganges and Euphrates; of America, Orenoque and Maragnon.

COELVM.
Heaven is defined to be the most simple body, or most free from an elementary
commixture of any: it is transparent, sphaericall, and consists in perpetual
motion. it undergoes a foursold consideration.

Viz. of The natural Philosopher, who treats of Heaven, as of a natural
body, composed of matter and form: and so it is the subject of Aristotle's book
entitled, De Coelo. The Astronomer, who investigateth the reason of the
variety of heavenly motions, the diversity of circles, asterismes, risings and
settings of Stars, and the like. The Astrologer, who discourses of the
variety of constellations, planeticall aspects, disposing of the houses, and by
these and their dispositions, conjectureth of future occurrences. The
Geographer, who medleth with the Heavens, because on their motions depends the
being or not being of all inferior bodies; and for that the Earth hangs in
the midst of it, like Architas or Archimedes Pigeon, equally poized with its
own weight.


Having thus briefly and rudely, as I must confess, glided over these general
notions of Geographie, I will now set down my promised definition.

GEOGRAPHIE is a description of the Earth by her parts and their limits,
situations, inhabitants, cities, rivers, fertility, and obseruable matters,
with all other things annexed thereunto. The worth of this science is apparent,
if you consider its Species, or several kinds. Vtilities or profits.


The Species are Hydographie; which is the delineation of the Sea by her
several names, promontories, creeks, and affections, as also of springs and
rivers. Topographie* which is the description of a particular place, be it
Town, City, or Village. Chorographie, which is a deciphering of any whole
Region, Kingdom, or Nation, and is twofold, viz. Ancient by Tribes and
Families, as Germany was divided between the Chatti, Ch^rusci* Suevi, Tencteri
etc. Modern, into S^^e^ and Provinces; as Germany now is into Franconie,
Saxony, Suevia, Bava^ia etc.



The Vt^lities of Geography, though many in number, are reduced to fine, such
as appertain
To Mercature and Navigations. To Astronomy, which by this is informed of the
appearance of diverse stars in diverse places, etc. To Statesmen, which out of
this fountain, draw the knowledge of their Princes bounds, and his neighbors
incroachings, etc. To Physic, which is hereby able to know the diversity of
temperatures in different climes, the nature of Simples, and where their growth
is most natural, etc. To History both Divine and Humane, that we may know in
what place every particular action has bin effected: for the knowledge of the
place, crowns the delight of the enterprise.


THE GENERAL PRAECOGNitA OF HISTORY.
AS Geography without History, has life and motion, but at random, and
unstable; so History without Geography, like a dead carcass, has neither life
nor motion at all, and as the exact notice of the place adds a satisfactory
del^ght to the action: so the mention of the action, beautifieth the notice of
the place. Geography therefore, and History, like the two fire-lights Castor
and Pollux, seen together, crown our happiness, but parted asunder, menace a
shipwreck of our content; and are like two sisters entirely loving each other,
and not without (I had almost said impiety) great pity to be divided: so as
that which Sr Philip Sidney said of Argalus and Parthenia, Her being was in him
alone,
And she not being he was none.
I may justly say of these two Gemini, History and Geography.

Before we come to the definition of History, Pezelius,
it is requisite we should distinguish it from such as at first blush do
challenge this name, and then to divide it into its subordinate Species.

The Treatises to whom this name is generally given, and from which History is
indeed really distinct, are Commentaries, 2. Annals, 3. Diaries, and 4.
Chronologies.

1. Commentaries set down a naked continuance of the events and actions,
without the motives and designs, the counsels, speeches, occasionsa, nd
pretexts, with other passages: so that Caesar modestly rather then truly,
applied the name of Commentary, to the best History in the world; though that
Archcriticke Lipsius call them, nuda and simplex narratio. His reason is,
Commentaria enim sunt, whereby you may perceive the fe^low had read the title:
and nihil pollicentur praeter nomen, by which it seems, he looked no further.
The worth of this History has a more sacred Advocate, Basilicon Doron.
even our dread Sovereign, who exhorting his Son to the study of History,
above all profane Writers commends him to his reading, both for the sweet
flowing of the style (I can use no better words then his own*) and the
worthiness of the matter it self. For I have ever (says he) bin of the
opinion, that of all Ethnic Emperors, or great Captains that ever were, he
has farthest excelled both in his practice, and in his precepts in martial
affairs. 2. Annals are only a bare recital of the occurrents happening every
year, without regard had to the causes, and with a general neglect of
Historical ornaments: so that Tacitus named his worthy book much amiss. 3.
Diaries contain (as the name imports) the particular actions of every day,
now not used but by Princes in their journeyes, and travelers in their
voyages. 4. Chronologies are only bare supputations of the times, without any
regard of the acts then happening, such are the Chronologies of Funccius,
Scaliger, and Helvicus. Of which last man, the incredible pains he has taken
in, and the infinite proficiencie which he has brought unto this study: I
cannot but give that excellent testimony which Paterculus affords Ovid,
Perfectissimus est in forma operis sui.
But History is as it were a quintessence extract out of those 4 Elements,
borrowing from them all somewhat to beautify her self withal; especially from
Annals, time; from Commentaries, matter; and from Chronologies consent of
times, and Coetanity of Princes Having thus gotten matter to work on, and time
in which she may effect her enterprises, she adds of her own store,
whatsoever ornaments are deficient in the rest, and makes her self complete
in every particular.

Having thus distinguished History from its Cognata, it remains we should
divide it into its subordinate Species.

Histories are either of the Greater World, Lesser World, or of man that (...).


Freigij Synopsis.
The former is Universal, of the World, and all things in it; this is
Cosmography, and is best handled by Pliny in his Natural History, etc.
Particular Of Heaven and its affections, this is Astronomy, and is beholding
to Aratus and Ptolomey, etc. Of the Earth and her parts; this is Geography, and
set forth by Strabo, Mela, etc.



The latter tell The inward works of man, as his opinions touching Religion or
Philosophy, whose History is compiled by Diogenes Laertius, etc. The outward
works which are Manners, Customs, and Laws, these belong to Policy, and
Statesmen. Actions Of the tongue Of some length, and such are Orations and
Speeches. Succinct Of one man, and are called Apothegmes. Of many, and are
called Proverbs, digested best by Erasmus

Of the hand, which branch themselves




Into two parts; being Either'of one man alone; such Histories are called
Lives, and are best done by Plutarch. Or of many, whose History is Universal,
belonging to the whole in general, with relation to the particular, or such of
the^ as are of note. Particular Ecclesiastical, which describes the Acts of
the Church, her beginning, increase, decrease, restoring, and continuance.
Civil, which relate the occurre^ces of co^mo^wealths, their beginnings, etc.




Having thus proposed a general scheme of Histories, and showed who deserve
the greatest applause in penning the first; I will also name such as have
enlightened our knowledge with the relations of the three last.

4. Voluminous Stow, and Holingshead, full of confusion and commixture of
unworthy relations. 5. Speed delighting the ear, and not a little informing
the mind. 7. Martin from William the Conqueror, to the death of Henry 8, a
pithie and worthy Historiographer. For pieces of history (I mean histories of
state, not of lives) we have the reign of Henry 7, excellently performed by
that renowned Scholar the Lord Francis, Vicount S. Albans; the reign of
Richard the 3, by that great restorer of learning in those parts, Sr Th. Moore;
the beginning of the preparatiues, to the reign of Henry 4, by Sr John
Hayward; In former times the reigns of the first 7 Kings after the conquest,
by Matthew Paris; and to end this bedroll, half the story of this Realm done
by Master Daniel, of which I believe that which himself says of it in his
Epistle, that there was never brought together more of the maine. Of Scotland I
find Hector Boethius to be the true parallel of Ge^srie Monmouth; and Buchanan
far worse then Polydor Virgil. For Wales, Humfrey Lloyd, and David Powell;
and for Ireland, and the out-Iles, Giraldus Cambrensis. For them al Andrew du
Chesne of the County of Touraine in France, who in his own tongue has taken
that pains in composing one body of story for all the Britain Isles and
states, extending it to the year 1612. that never any of the natives durst
undertake, or had hope to atchieue. But for all, and above them all, judicious
M. Camden in his book entitled Britannia, wherein he has given great light to
histories already extant, and to such as future ages shall produce. And if he
had taken in hand a plenary History of this I Will, or any one part thereof, it
had been (I am sure) matchless. But I will suspend my judgment with that of
the Historian, Paterculu^
Vivorum ut magna admiratio, ita censura est difficilis.

Thus much of the Authors of Universal, Ecclesiastical and Civil history, a
word or two only of Computation, and then to the Definition.

The two eyes of the body of a well-compacted History, are place and time; the
former belongs to Geography, the latter is the terminus of all Epoches in
computation. Now an Era or Epoche is the terminus a quo, from which every
reckoning of times takes its beginning. These have among diverse Nations, bin as
diversely different, and as differently calculated by Chronologers, few of them
agreeing among themselves in this point* For my part I follow Fr^igius,
Fr^igius.
who out of the foundest authors thus stateth them. The Christians make their
Epoch^ the birth of Christ, which happned in the year of the World 3962; but
this reckoning they used not till the year 600, following in the mean time the
civil account of the Empire. The Mahumetans begin their Hegira (for so they
term their Computation) from the return of their Prophet to Mecha, after he
was driven thence by the Philarcha, which happened Ao Chr. 617. The Grecians
reckoned by Olympiads, the first of which is placed in the year of the world,
3187. but this account perishing under the Constantinopolitan Emperors, they
reckoned by Indictions, every Indiction containing 15 years, and the first
beginning Ao C. 313. which among Chronologers is still used. The Romans
reckoned first from the building of their City, which was A.M. 3213. and
afterward from the 16. year of the Emperor Augustus A. M. 3936. which
reckoning was used among the Spaniards, till the reign of Ferdinand the
Catholic. The Jews had diverse Epoches, as the Creation of the World in the
beginning of time. 2. From the Universal deluge Ao 1556. 3. From the confusion
of tongues Ao 1786. 4. From Abraham's journey out of Chaldea into Canaan, Ao
2021. 5. From the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt Ao 24^1. 6.
From the year of Iubile Ao 2499. 7. From the building of Solomon's Temple Ao
2^32. and 8. from the captivity of Babylon Ao 3357. But rejecting the ^^st, we
will in our historical computation of time, use only the two most ordinary
Epochet, of the Worlds Creation, and Christ's appearance in the flesh.

The name of History is deduced (...), id est, videre, and does properly
intimate a relation of such remarkable actions, at the performing of which,
the Author was present. Apud veteres enim (says Isidore in his Etyma) nemo
scribebat historiam, nisi is qui interfuisset, and ea qua scribenda essent,
vidisse^. But the customary use of the word, has now taught it a more ample
signification. History being defined to be a memorial or relation of all
occurrents obseruable, happening in a Commonwealth, described by the motives,
pretexts, consultations, speeches, and events, together with an especial care
had of time and place.

Cicero beautifieth History with these attributes, Lux veritatis, testis
temporis, vitae magistra, nuncia vetustatis, and vitae memoriae; concerning
which particle, I find these verses prefixed to a Chronicle of our state,
written by M. Martin; For though in these days miracles be fled,
Yet this shall of good Histories be se'd,
They call back time that is past, and give life to the dead.
Beside these conditions, P^z^li^^.
it is requisite that the relations should be absolutely true, neither swaruing
to one side through malice, nor leaning to the other through affection; so that
two things are requisite in an Historiographer, ^. a generous and resolute
spirit: 2. An upright and sincere conversation; that so he may neither be
daunted by a tyrannical Prince, nor transported with partiality; that he might
dare to deliver all the truth without fear, and yet not dare to relate any
thing which is false through favor.

Thus much of H^story, its distinctions, divisions, affections, authors, and
properties: now only of its commodities, and so we will hoyse sail for Europe.

Although to number up the especial delight and profit gathered from the
reading of histories, be but as it were to light a Candle before the Sun, and
speak of such things as require no Rhetoric to adorn them: yet I hope I
shall no ways do amiss in laying before you some of the chief. The profits
then of History are these.

1 It is the rule of direction, by whose square we ought to rectify our
obliquities, and in this sense the Orator calls it Magistra vitae. 2 It
stirs men to virtue, and deterreth them from vice, by showing the glorious
memory of the one, and stinking repetition of the other: but especially it
keeps many men of place and calling in a continual fear of ill doing,
knowing that their villainies shall there be laid open to the view of the
vulgar. Let Tiberius be example. 3 It has been not only the inventor, but
the conseruer of all arts, such especially whose end consists only in action.
4 It informs a man's mind in all particular observations, making him
serviceable to his Prince and Country. 5 It is the best Schoolmaster of war,
the teacher of Strata. gems, and gives more directions then a whole Senate;
Alexander learned of Achilles, Scipio of Xenophons Cyrus, and Selim the first
of Alex: al which became valiant and politic captains. 6 It is the
Politicians best assistant and chief Tutor, who hence suck their observations
and conclusions, and learn ability to rule both in peace and war: who like
Archimedes in his study, or Demosthenes in his gown, can more dangerously
trouble their enemies, than the Syracusans and Athenians in armor. 7 It is
most available to the study of Divinity, since the increase, original,
defects, restoration, and continuance of religion is a dependant on History,
which also has many other rare passages for the understanding of the Text. 8
It is (lastly and least of all) the study which affords a man the greatest
aid in discoursing, it delights the ear, contenteth the mind, and is endued
with thousands varieties of pleasure mixed with profit, but these shall serve as
a taste for the rest.
OF THE WORLD: AND FIRST OF EVROPE.
THe WORLD is divided into two parts, Unknown, Maginus.
or not fully discovered, and it lies either under the Articke, or under the
Antarticke circle. The former is rather supposed then known; the latter a
little known, and has the names of Noua Guinea, Terra del fuego, P^ittacoru^
regio, Maletur, etc. of which in the end of this book. Known either Anciently
Europe. Asia. Africa.
Lately, as America.



EVROPE is joined to Asia by that space of earth between the heads of Tanais
and Duina: Asia is joined to Africa by the Egyptian Istmus: America is joined
(as most conjecture) to none of them. Europe is separated from Asia by Duina,
Tanais, Pal^^ Maeotis, Pontus, Propontis, Hellespont, and the Aegean, Asia is
parted from Africa by the Red Sea, Africa from Europe, by the Mediterranean:
Africa is greater then Europe; Asia then Africa; and America bigger then all.

They which have taken a delight in resembling every particular country to
things more obvious to the sight and understanding, have likened EVROPE to a
Dragon, the head thereof (forsooth) being Spain, the wings Italy and
Denmark. In like manner they have been curiously impertinent in resembling
France to a Lozenge or Rhomboides: Belgia to a Lion, Britain to an Axe:
Ireland to an Egg: Peloponnesus to a Plantane leaf: Spain to an Ox hide
spread on the ground: Italy (which indeed holds best proportion) to a man's
leg, with diverse the like phantasmes of a capricious brain: these countries no
more resembling them, then pictures made when painting was in her infancy,
under which they were feign to write, this is a Lion, and this is a Whale; for
fear the spectators might have taken one for a Cock, and the other for a Cat.

K^ck^rm.
EVROPE though the least (as being in length but 3800, in breadth but 1200
miles) is yet of most renown: first because of the temperature of the air,
and fertility of the foil; secondly, from the study of all Arts, both
ingenious and mechanical: thirdly, because of the Roman and Greek Monarchies;
fourthly, from the purity and syncerenesse of the Christian faith: fifthly
because we dwell in it, and so first place it.

EVROPE is divided into Continent and Islands; the Continent is subdivided into
1. Spain. 2. France. 3. Italy. 4. Belgia. 5. Germany. 6. Denmark 7. Norway.
8. Sweden. 9. Muscovia. 10. Poland. 11. Hungary. 12. Dacia. 13. Sclavonia and
14. Greece. The Islands are also in general, either dispersed in the 1. Aegean
Sea. 2. the Ionian Sea. 3. the Adriatique. 4. the Mediterranean. 5. the
British. and 6. the Northern Seas, of all which in the order and method, here
and before proposed.

EVROPE is so called from Europa, daughter to Agenor, King of the Phoenicians,
brought hither (as the Poets feign) by Jupiter in the shape of a Bull: but as
Histories write, by a Cretan Captain named Taurus, or in a ship whose beak
had wrought in it the figure of that beast.

Br^erwood.
In these Countries above particularized, besides the Latin tongue, which is
now rather scholasticall then national; and besides the Italian, French, and
Spanish, being but as so many several corruptions of the Latin; and besides
the English, which is a compound of Dutch, Latin, and French: there are in all
14 mother tongues, which owe little or nothing to the Roman, viz: Irish spoken
in Ireland, and the West of Scotland: 2. British in Wales. 3. Cantabrian or
B^scaine, nigh unto the Cantabrian Ocean, and about the Pyrenean hills: 4.
Arabique in the mountains of Granada: 5. Finnique in Finland, and Lapland. 6.
Dutch (though with different dialects) in Germany, Belgia, Denmark,
Swethland, and Norwey. 7. Cauchian which the East-Freizlanders (or Cauchi)
speak among themselves, for to strangers they speak Dutch. 8. Slavonish,
whose extent we will hereafter show. 9. I^^yrian on the East side of Istria,
and in the Isle of Veggia: 10. Greek. 11. Hungarian, and 12. Epirotique in the
greater and more mountainous parts of these countries. 13. Iazygian on the
North side of Hungary, between Dannbius and Tibiscus: and 14. Tartarian in
the Taurica Chersonesus, and European seats of that people.

I had almost forgot the Etymology of EVROPE according to Becanus, who
thinking it unmeet that Europe being first inhabited by the Gomerites or
Cymbrians, should have a Greek name; makes it Europe quasi Verhopp by the
transposition of the two first letters; Ver forsooth signifying (though I know
not in what language) excellent, and Hopp a multitude of people: because Europe
contains (oh the wit of man!) a multitude of excellent people.

OF SPAIN.
THe most Western country of the Continent of Europe, Hist. of Sp.
is Spain, environed on all sides with the Sea, except toward France; from
which it is separated by the natural strength of the Pyrenean mountains, and
the artificial fortress of Pampelune on the Northwest and Perpigna on the
Southeast.

The figure of it is by Strabo compared to an Oxehide spread on the ground,
whose neck being the Istmus which tieth it unto France, is not of such
breadth, but that in a clear day one may discover the Sea on both sides.

The Country has been in diverse ages diversely named, as 1. Hesperia either
from Hesperus a supposed King hereof, or from Hesperus the evening Star,
under which it was supposed to be situate, as being the farthest Country
Westward. 2. Iberia either from the famous river Iberus, or from the Iberi,
inhabiting the Country in Asia, which we call Georgia. 3. Hispania, as their
old Legends report, from Hispanus one of the Kings; but as the soundest
judgments agree, from Panus the Iberian Captain, For the Grecians call it
(...) Spania, as may be proved in many places, that especially of the 15 to
the Romans verse the 28, (...), I will come by you into Spain. No doubt but
from the Grecians the old Romans borrowed the name of Spania, which they often
used, to which the Spaniards according to their custom adding E. (as in
Escola, Escuda, etc.) made it Espania and now Hispania.

Grimston et Maginus.
The whole circuit is 2480 Italian, or 1893 English miles. It is situate in the
more Southernly part of the Northern temperate Zone, and almost in the m^dd^st
of the fourth and sixth C^i^ats, the longest day being fifteen hours in
length.

Boterus reckoned the number of the Inhabitants, to be 8 millions of living
souls, which computation may yet stand good. 1. If the heat of the Country
unfit for generation; 2. the barrenness of the soil unfit for sustenance. 3.
the number of Colonies planted in other kingdoms; and 4. The great wars of
the last King, have not d^minished them.

They are a mixed people descending from the Goths, Sarracens, and Jews: Hist.
of Sp.
from the Jews they borrow superstition, from the Sarracens melancholy, from
the Goths desire of liberty. How the Goths and Sarracens came in hither,
shall be sh^wne in it is proper place. The Jews were here placed, partly by
Vlidor Vbit the Caliph, who sent hither 50000 families of Moors and Jews: but
principally by Adrian the Emperor, who having totally banished the Jews from
their native country, sent them to people this Region: the whole number of the^
which came hither being no less then 500000 men, women, and children. Which
several nations by several marriages are in process of time incorporate into
one. Euphormionis Icon Anim.
They are much given to women, impudent braggers, and extremely proud in the
lowest ebb of fortune; as appears by the poor Cobbler on his deathbed, who
commanded his eldest Son coming to him for his last blessing, to endeavor
to retain the maiest^e worthy so great a family; Memineris (said he) in
mai^statem assurgere familia tua dignam. The same Author relates another story
to the like purpose. A wom^n of this Country, attended on by three of her
bratts, went a begging from door to door. Some French Merchants traveling that
way, and pitying her case, offered her to take into their service the bigger
of her boys. But she, proud though poor, scorning, as she said, that any of
her lineage should endure a prentiship, returned them this answer; Qui aut tu,
aut ego, sciamus, in quae fata sit genitus? For ought that she or they knew,
her son (simply as he stood there) might live to be king of Spain. Not much
unlike to these is that tale of a Spanish Caualei^o, who being for some faults
by him committed, whipped through the principal streets of Paris: and keeping
a sober pace, was advised by a friend to make more have that he might the
sooner be out of his pain: but he half in choler replied That he would not
lose the least step of his pace for all the whipping in Paris. For indeed their
gate is (Gennet-wise) very stately and maiesticall. But not to conceal their
virtues and make our selves merry only at their follies, wherein all other
nations bear more or less a share with them; they are questionless a people
very grave in their carriages, and in offices of piety very devout, to their
King very obedient, and of their civil duties to their betters not unmindful.
But that which in them deserves the greatest commendations, is an unmoved
patience in suffering adversities, accompanied with a settled resolution to
overcome them: a noble virtue, of which in their Indian discoueries they showed
excellent proofs: and received for it a glorious and a golden reward.

It is said, that the French are wiser then they seem, and the Spaniards seem
wiser then they are; wherein they agree with many particular men of other
nations, who carry the basest spirits under the prowdest looks, and little
found schollership under the most promising visages: and according to the
Philosopher, Sapientes potius cupiunt videri and non esse, Aristotle.
quam esse and non videri. In matters of war the Spaniards are too slow and
dull, the French too headie and precipitate; the one loosing as many fair
occasions by delays, as the other overthrows by too much have: but between
them both, they make one good Soldier; who according to the present
opportunities, is to make use of the spur of courage; or the bit of respect.

Hist. of Sp.
The women are sober, loving their husbands or friends; wonderful delicate,
curious in painting and perfuming: and though they have wine in abundance, yet
are they not permitted to drink it; verifying therein the English proverb,
that none are wors^ sh^d then the sho^makers wife. They were wondrous strong,
and beyond belief patient in the throws of childbed. Strabo tells out of
Possidonius, of a woman that being hired for harvest work, felt her travel
coming on her; who because she would not lose her days wages, withdrewe her
self under a bush, where being eased of her burden, she returned from one
labor to another.

Brerewood.
The language has much affinity with the Latin. Brerewood in his Enquiries
teporteth that he has seen a letter, every word whereof was both good Latin
and good Spanish. Merula shows a Copy of the like, page 300. By reason of this
consonancy with the Latin, the Spaniards call their language Romance. The
other ingredients of this tongue are generally the Gotish, Arabique, and old
Spanish; and in some places the French also: these people having made great
conquests, and having had great negotiations in this country. It is said to
be a very lofty swelling speech, full of complement and courteship.

Hist. of Sp.
The Country heretofore was very abundant in Mines, insomuch that it was never
free from Rouers of al nations. And it is affirmed that Annibal out of one only
Mine in the Country of the Turdetani (now part of Andaluzia) received 3000l
daily. It is enriched also with Sackes, Sugars, Oil, Metals, Liquoras, Rice,
Silk, Lamb-skinnes, Wool, Cork, Rosen, Steel, Orenges, Raisons, and fruit
of the like nature, which owe most of their being to heat. But in Corn which
is the staff of life, it is very defective, and receaueth from Italy, France,
and Sicilie the greatest part of it. The Cattle hereof are neither fair nor
many; so that their fare is for the most part on sallets and ^ruits of the
earth; every Gentleman being limited what flesh he shall buy for himself and
his family. When that worthy Soldier Sr Roger Williams heard a Spaniard
foolishly bragging of his Country Sallets, he gave him this answer, you have
indeed good s^wce in Spain, but we have dainty Beefes, Veales, and Muttons to
eat with that sawee; and as God made Beasts to live on the grass of the earth,
so he made man to li^e upon them. And it is observed that if a Spaniard have a
capon or the like good dish to his supper, you shall find all the feathers
scattered before his door by the next morning.

For traveling the Innes and Vents of this Country are very ill provided,
insomuch that most men that would not go supperlesse to sleep, carry their
provision at their saddle bows; and men of worth their bedding also. So poor
and mean is the entertainment in these places.

Here lived in ancient times the Giants Gerion and Cacus, which were queld by
Hercules: and in the flourishing of the Roman Empire, Seneca the Tragoedian;
and a Philosopher of the same name, a man of that happy memory, that he could
repeat 2000 names in the same order that they were rehearsed. Quintilian the
Orator, Lucian, and Martial, excellent in their kinds, and Pemponius Mela the
Geographer. In the middle times Fulgentius, and Isidore Bishop of Sevill. And
in our Fathers days Arias Montanus, Hist. of Sp.
Osorius, Tostatus, Masius, etc. The principal Soldiers were Theodosius the
Great, Bernard del Carpio, Cid Ruis Dias, Sancho the great of Navarre,
Ferdinand the Catholic, Charles the Emperor, etc.

The Christian Religion was first here planted (as they say) by St James Anno
37. They were all constant to the Bishop of Rome, insomuch that in the sixth
Council of Tolledo, it was enacted that the King should suffer none to live in
his Dominions that profess not the Roman Catholic Religion; of which their
King is so great a Patron, that a late Pope being sick, and hearing diverse
moan his approaching end; uttered words to this effect, My life can nothing
profit the Church, but pray for the king of Spain as its chief supporter.
Sands relations.
For indeed the Kings of Spain, having framed to themselves an hope of the
Western Monarchy; and finding no fitter means of enlarging their own
temporal, then by co^curring with the Pope in upholding his spiritual Empire:
have linked themselves most fast to that See. To this end they have taken upon
the^ to be the executioners of his exco^municatio^s, by which office Ferdinand
the Catholic surprised Navarre; hoping in time to work so upon the rest of
the interdicted states of Europe: which Monarchy of the Spaniard is by the
Jesuits (who in all their persuasions couple, as one God, and one Pope, so one
King) taught to be the only means to unite the differences of the Church, and
subdue that great enemy of religion the Turk. And though by this office the
kingdom of Spain and Popedom of Rome, be thus straightly combined; yet
herein the Popes have ouershot themselves, in that leaning so much to the
Spaniard, and so immoderately increasing his dominion; they do in a manner
stand at his devotion, and may peradventure in the end be forced to cast
themselves into his arms as their good Lord and master. For certain it is
that the Spanish Agents have openly braued the Cardinals, and told them that
they hoped to see the day, wherein their King should offer to the Pope half a
dozen to be made Cardinals, and he not dare to refuse any: and that they
themselves should choose no Pope but one of their masters naming. So great an
inconvenience it is more then possible it may be to the Popes, in making this
Prince the one and only string to their bow.

Hist. of Sp.
The chief Rivers are 1. Tagus, celebrated for his golden sands, the head of it
is in the mountain Seira Molina near to Cuenca, from the which it runs by
the city Tolledo, and then smoothly gliding by the walls of Lisbon, does pay
his tribute to the Western Ocean. 2. Ana (now Guadiana) which rising about the
same place, runs afterward under the ground the space of 15 miles, and hence
the Spaniards brag, that they have a bridge whereon 10000 cattle daily feed.
This is an accident common to many rivers, as to Mole a small river in Surrey,
Erasinus in Greece, and Lycus in Anatolia, of which last thus Ovid. Sic vbi
terreno Lycus est epotus ^iatu,
Existit procul hinc, alioque renaseitur ere.
So Lycus swallowed by the gaping ground
At a new mouth far off is rising found.
3. Ba^is (now Guadalquivir) which in the Arabique signifies a great River.
This together with Guadiana augment the south Sea with their liquid currents.
4. Duerus which arising from the hills of Biscay runs Westward. 5. Iberus,
which having his head among the fame mountains, runs Eastward almost 400
miles, and is nauigable 200: the other I will hereafter specify.

The chief hills are three, 1. Idubeda, Iubalda or Aurentius Sa^us, stretching
from the Pyrenai toward Portugal. 2. Seira Morena, declining from the midst of
Spain toward the streights of Gibraltar. A chain of hills sufficiently
famous, were it only in this that Cervanses the wit of Spain, made it the
scene of of many the warlike exploits achieved by the flower and cream of
Knight errantrie, Brerewood.
Don Quixot de la Mancha. And thirdly the Alpuxaras or Seira Nevada, which
thwart the kingdom of Granada from East to West: high steepy hills, and among
which the people to this day speak the Arabique tongue perfectly.

This kingdom was first inhabited by Tubal the son of Iaphet, Hist. of Sp.
from whom to Gargarus Melicola, are numbered 25 kings; who lasted 988 years:
the chief of which are said to have been, 1 Hesperus, who subduing also
Italy, named both countries Hesperia; but so, that Italy was called Hesperia
the greater; and Spain, Hesperia the less. 2. Hispanus whence they conceit
the name of Hispania to be derived. 3. Tagus. 4. Baetus, and 5. Anus, whence
the three famous Rivers in Spain so called, must by all means be derived. 6.
Idubeda, god father no doubt to the great mountain so called. 7. Sicileus from
whom the I Will of Sicilie is said to take denomination. 8. Hispalus, who is
reported to have built the City Sevill or Hispalis. 9. Brigus the founder of
Flavio Briga, and other Towns ending in Briga. 10. Lusus who gave name to
Lusitania or Portugal. The Catalogue of these Kings I desire no man to believe
farther then that of our own state from Brute to Cassibeline. As for the
coming of Tubal hither, it is doubtleffe a mere vanity; though we deny not
that the Spaniards are of the progeny of Tubal, as being the descendants of
the ^beri; whom Josephus says to have been anciently called Thobe^os: a name
in which are all the radical letters of Tubal, and not much differing from it
in sound. Somewhat before the time of G^rga^us Melicola, the Iberians came in
under Panus, and immediately after his death, the country was divided amongst
many Princes and Commonweales, till the coming of the Carthaginians, for the
space of nine hundred and odd years; in which time we find nothing
obseruable. The Romans first becoming Masters of it, divided it into
Vlteriorem, Maginus.
lying from the river Iberus westward, and 2. Citeriorem between the Iberus
and Pyrenean Hills. But having totally wrested it from the Carthaginians, they
divided it into. Tarraconensem, so cal^ed of Tarragon the Metropolis;
containing Castile, Navarre, Arragon, Biscay etc. 2. Baetic^m, of the river
Baetis running through it; comprehending, Granada, Andaluzia, and Estremadura.
3. Lusitanicam from Lusui the 17th King, and Tania, which signifies a Region,
being somewhat of larger extent then Portugal. Brerewood
Of these 3 parts, Boetica was in most esteem under the Romans, insomuch that
in this Province there were reckoned to be 8 Roman Colonies; 8 municipall
Cities, and 29 other Towns, endued with the rights and privileges of the
Latins. The reason hereof was, that the people of this Country having been
formerly broken by the Carthaginians, with more quiet endured the yoke of the
Romans; whereas the rest for a long time resisted the entry and Empire of that
prevailing City.

Hist. of Sp.
Scipio Africanus laid the first foundation of the Roman government in this
country, which building, though undertaken by many excellent workmen, was not
thoroughly finished til the days of Augustus, being almost 200 years since the
first attempt. He roofed it, strengthened it, and made it a principal house in
his Monarchical city. Florus.
For the old incolae were exceeding valiant and resolute, sometimes disgracing,
sometimes endangering the Roman reputation; insomuch that there were more
Commanders lost in these wars than any other. At first the Romans fought not
with the Spaniards, but the Carthaginians in Spain; then perished both the
Scipio's, viz* the father and the uncle of Africanus. Viriathus held war for
20 years: Numantia resisted 15 years, the Astures remained unconquered; and
also stiffely maintained their particular liberties, that dijundicari non
poterat (says Velleius) Hispanisne Romany plus esset in armis roboris, and
vter populus alteri pariturus foret. Such were the ancient Spaniards. This
Country continued a Roman Province till about the year 400, when it was
subdued by Gundericus and his Vandals: of which people, their beginnings,
atchieuments, and period, we will dilate when we come into Africa, where the
glory of them was most eminent, and where they ended like a Candle in a stink.
These Vandals were not warm in their new conquests, when the Goths (of whom
more in Sweden) seized on this country; confining the Vandals within Baetica,
which afterward they left, partly to eschew the neighborhood of a potent
enemy, and partly on better hopes in Afric.

The Goths now seated in Spain, Hist. of Sp.
had yet the Romans as pearls in their eyes, and pricks at their hearts,
neither were they totally expelled till 642. This people were Christians;
though infected with Arrianisme, which ended in the days of Leonigild, anno
586. Their Kings were chosen by election, and an excommunication laid on such
by the fifth council of Tolledo, as withstood the choice of the people. Their
laws most in use were customary, written Statutes being first made by King
Henry, which the ensuing Princes perfected and established.

to the Moors of Africa, Hist. of Sp.
and in the mean time deflowred his daughter Caua; which the father took in
such indignation, that he procured the Moors, amongst whom he had much credit,
to come over into Spain. This request they performed under the conduct of Musa
and Tarif: and having made a full conquest, ^ MS h^st. of the Sarr.
erected their kingdom. It is recorded that at the first coming of Tariff
into Spain, a poor woman of the country being willingly taken prisoner, fell
down at his feet, kissed them, and told him that she had often heard her father
(who was lettered) say, that Spain should be conquered by 2 people, whose
General should have a mole on his right shoulder, and in whom one of his hands
should be longer then the other. He to animate his Soldiers against the next
encounter, unclothed himself and showed the mark, which so encouraged them,
that they now doubted not the victory. Rodericke had in his army 130000 foot,
and 25000 horse: Tariff had 30000 horse, and 180000 foot. The battle
continued 7 days together from morning to night: at last the Moors were
victorious. What became of king Rodericke was never known; his Soldiers took
one arrayed in their kings apparel, whom upon examination they found to be a
Shepherd; with whom the king after the discomfiture had changed clothes.
It is written also that before the coming of thofe Saracens, king Roderick
upon hope of some treasure, Hist. of Sp.
did open a part of the Palace of long time forbidden to be touched: but
found nothing but pictures which resembled the Moors; with a prophecy, that
whenever the Palace was there opened, such ^ people as was there resembled,
should overcome Spain, and so it happened.

The Moors now Lords of Spain, by the treason of Julian, who having seen the
miserable death of his wife and children, was starued in prison by the
Africans: permitted free use of religion to the old inhabitants; least they
seeking new dwellings for the liberty of conscience, should leave their native
soil desolate. The Moors finished their conquest in five years, say some;
others in two; and some again in eight mone^hs. To keep the new conquered
country in subjection no way was so conven^ent as to plant Colonies: but the
Morisco women would not abandon their old seats. Hereupon Musa and Tarif by
gifts, pardons, and persuasions drew many Christian women to forsake their
religion; whom they married to the Soldiers. Not long after, Vlidor Vbit (whom
some call Alma^zar) the great Caliph, sent over about 50000 families of Moors
and Jews; assigning them a convenient portion of lands, to be held with great
immunities, and upon small rents. These politic courses notwithstanding, the
Moors long enjoyed not sole sovereignty herein; for the Christians having now
recovered breath, chose themselves Kings: and the authority of the Caliphs
declining, gave the Saracen Moors liberty to erect diverse petty royalties; so
that at last Spain fell into a twelue-partite division, viz: into the
kingdoms and proprietary estates of 1 Leon and Oviedo. 2 Navarre. 3 Corduba, 4
Gallicia. 5 Biscay ^ Tolledo. 7 Murcia. 8 Castile. 9 Portugal. 10 Valentia. 11
Catelogne. and 12 Arragon, of which in order.

LEON and OVIEDO.
The kingdom of LEON and OVIEDO has on the East and South Biscay and Castile;
Hist. of Sp.
on the North the Ocean; on the West Gallicia. This country is by a more
ancient name called Asturia, from the Astures which were the ancient
inhabitants hereof. It yielded the small, though swift, horses, which from
hence the Romans called Asturcones; we may english them Hobbies: but in
process of time, this Asturco became a common name for Geldings; and Asturco
Macedonicus in Petronius is nothing but a Macedonian Nagge. Seldon in tit. of
hon.
This is the honor or title of the eldest son of Castile, who is called
Prince of the Asturias; which some suppose to be given unto them, because this
was the first principality which held up against the Moors. But indeed the
true original hereof is to be referred to the time of the marriage of
Catharine, daughter unto John of Gaunt, and in right of her mother Constance
true heir to the realm of Castil: unto Henry son to John the first then in
possession of that kingdom. For to this new married couple it was granted,
that after the manner of England, where the heir apparent is called Prince of
Wales; they should be called Princes of the Asturia's. In succeeding times the
towns of Iean, Vbeda, Biatia, and Andutar, were added to the patrimony; and
so unto this day continue.

The chief Town^s of this kingdom are 1 Aviles on the Sea side. 2 Palenza,
which first felt the arms of the Sucvi. 3 Oviedo, which gave title to the
first Christ^an Kings after the Moorish conquest. It was joined in title with
Leon Anno 896. and quite left out by Raymir, 904. 4. Aftorga, a Town happy in
this, that it felt not the fury of the lustful king Vi^iza; who to secure
himself in unlawful pleasures, and weaken his subjects, if they should
attempt revenge; dismantled all the towns in Spain except Leon, Tolledo, and
this Astorga. 5 Leon recovered from the Moors 712, and by some called Legio,
because they guess the 1^th Legion to have here lodged, which was called Legio
Germanica.

Hist. of Sp.
That kingdoms are to be kept by the same means they are got, is an axiom
among Politicians: but that they are lost by the same, would seem harsh unto
them; yet so it happened to the Moors. The lust of Rodericke, a Spanish king,
brought them thither; and the lust of Magnutza, a Moorish Viceroy, gave the
first check to their fortune, which proved at last the overthrow of that
kingdom: for Magnutza having employed Pelagius, a young Prince of the
Asturia's, on an Embassy to Musa, the Captain General of the Moors, then
resident at Corduba; in his absence ravished his sister, and at his return
died by the edge of his sword: in applause of which noble act, and hope of
greater exploits, Pelagius was by the people made King of Oviedo.

This was the first time that ever Arms were borne quartered; and was seconded
by our Edward the 3d, who to show his title to the Crown of France, not only
took on the title of King of France, but quartered the Arms thereof with
those of England as to this day they continue.

2. NAVARRE.
NAVARRE is the second kingdom for antiquity in Spain. it has on the East
the Pyrenean mountains, on the West Iberus, on the North Biscay, Mercat^^
on the South Arragon. The old inhabitants hereof were the Vascones, who
passing over the hills into France, possessed that part of it, called since
Vasconia or Gascoigne.

The ch^efe Ci^ties are Victoria, made a City by John husband to Q Blanch,
king of Arragon and Navarre. Th^s town is situate in the country which they
now call Alava, which in our ordinary Mappes is placed between Castile and
Biscay* of which last it seems to have been a part. 2 Viana the title of the
Navarran Prince. Gui^ciard.
Nigh unto this Town Caesar Borgia was slain by an ambush: he was son to
Pope Alexander the 6, and by his father first made Cardinal, but reliquishing
that title, he was by king Charles the 8, made Duke of Valence in Daulphine.
During the life of his father he had reduced many towns to the obedience of
the Church; but after his death he was by Pope Iulio the 2, confined. From
Rome he stole to Gonsalvo, Viceroy in Naples, for Ferdinand the Catholic;
who, notwithstanding his safe conduct given, sent him prisoner to Spain: from
hence he escaped desperately, (sliding down a window) into Navarre, where he was
(as we have said) slain by an ambush. So many times was Machiavels great
Politician ouer-reached by bookemen and soldiers. 3. Sanguessa, whose
Inhabitants and neighbors in the beginning of this Pyrenean kingdom, paid a
tribute of kine yearly. And 4 Pampelune the Metropolis of this Country, a
town banded by the racket of Fortune, into the hazards of Goths, Moors,
Navarrois, French, and now Castilians.

It took the name of Navarre, either from a town amongst the mountains, called
Navarrin, a place most likely, by reason of its strong situation, to resist the
fury of the Moors, and to support the title of a new Potentate: or 2 from
Navois, signifying a champion Country. It was also called the kingdom of
Sobabre, Hist. of Sp.
for that the Pyrenei are in this place so called. The first king was Garcia
Ximenes, who with 600 men only, began to oppose the Saracens, and left both
title and possession unto his successors. The sixth from this Garcia, was Inigo
surnamed Arista, who began the ceremony of crowning and anointing in this
Continent, according to the Spanish History. But the old Roman Provincial,
cited by Mr Seldom in his Titles of Honor, acknowledges no such honor due
hereto: ascribing it only to the Emperors of the East and West, the Kings of
Jerusalem, England, France, and Sicily. The 13th King was Sancho, for his
valor and potencie surnamed the great; He was the first that ever did write
himself King of Spain, his predecessors calling themselves kings of Navarre,
his co^temporaries kings of Leon only, the Goths Kings of the Goths in
Spain, and so the Vandals and Suevi. The reason was, because being a Prince of
great power-ablenesse, he had also almost all Spain, which belonged not to the
Moors, in his possession. The Earldom of Arragon was united to this Navarre,
Ao 867, when Garcia king hereof was married to Vrraca heir of Arragon* Castile
he held in the right of his wife Donna Nugna, sister and heir to Earl Sancho:
and as for Leon, he forcibly detained a great part of it under his Empire. Had
all those Estates continued united under one head, questionless the Kingdom
of the Moors had not so long subsisted; but this Sancho loving all his sons
alike, gave them alike portions and honors, bequeathing to his eldest son
Garcia, Navarre; and that part of Leon which he conquered: to his second son
Fernando, Castile: to his base son Raymir, Arragon, both which he had erected
into Kingdoms. By means of this vnpolitick course, his sons being of equal
powers and honors, instead of opposing the common foe, bandied against each
other; which, had all these principalities remained joined, or the latter not
dignified with the title of Kingdoms, had bin avoided. The 30th King was
Charles the 2d, whom I mention not for any glorious actions achieved in his
life, for that was full enough of ignominy; but for the strangenes and
hideousnes of his death. He was a king much given to voluptuousnes and sensual
pleasures, which so wasted his spirits, that in his old age he fell into a kind
of a Lethargy. To comfort his benumbed joints, he was bound and sowed up naked
in a sheet steeped in boiling Aquavitae: The Surgeon having made an end of
sowing him, and wanting a knife to cut off the thread, took a wax candle that
stood lighted by him; but the flame running down by the thread, caught hold on
the sheet, which (according to the nature of Aquavitae) burned with that
vehemency, that the miserable King ended his days in the fire. The 38th
Princes were Katharine Queen of Navarre, and John Earl of Albret in
Gascoigne, her husband; in whose reign Navarre was surprised by Fernando the
Catholic, as anon I will more particularly tell you. In the mean time let us
sum up the Kings of this hilly Realm.

48 1610 39 Lewis King of France and Navarre now living, with whom remain the
Rights, but not the Possession of this Kingdom. For in the reign of
Catharine, and John of Albret, Ferdinand the Catholic, gathered a great power
under pretense of rooting out the Moors, and surprised this Kingd^me
altogether unprovided, and destitute of all means to make the smallest
resistance, Anno 1512. The pretended reason of this surprizall, was an
Excommunication, laid on these Prince by the Pope, of which this King took upon
him to be the executioner: but the true cause was an ancient desire which this
King had to prossesse this frontire Kingdom, it being a strong Bulwark
against France. It happened then that Lewis the 12th having incurred the
displeasure of Pope Iulio the second, was together with all his adherents,
excommunicated, and his and their estates given to such as could or would
subdue them. The King and Queen of Navarre were at this time both French
subject, he in respect of Albret his paternall inheritance, and she of her
Earledomes of Foize and Bearne; and therefore sided with the French King.
Guicciardin
Ferdinand having (as we said) levied an army under color of extirpating ths
Moors, turns upon the French King, and demands of these Princes not only a
free passage through their Country, but also to have certain places of
strength put into his hands for his better assurance. These unjust demands the
Navar^^ys denied, whereupon Ferdinand with all expedition, invadeth the
kingdom, which he took without a blow given; the French King being as
backward in affording due assistance, as the other was unprovided of means for
defense The French netled with this loss, diverse times attempted the recovery
of it, but in va^ne, ^or the Spainiard still keeps it.
The arms of Navarre are Gu^es a Carbuncle nowed Or. Bara.

begun by Garcia the sixth: their blazon is a pot of Lillies, on which is graued
the portraiture of our Lady; their duty was to defend the faith, and daily to
repeat certain Ave Mary's, etc.

3. CORDVBA.
The Kingdom of CORDVBA comprehended And^luzia, the Country of Granada and
Estremadura. Ortelius.


ANDALVZIA called by Pl^ny Conventus Cordubensis, is between the hill Seira
Morena North, Granada East, and the Sea: it is so called quasi Vandaluzia from
the Vandals, who long time, and till their expulsion into Africa possessed it.

This is the most rich and fertile country of all Spain, watered with the
rivers Anas, 2 Odier, 3 Batis, and 4 Teneo.

Martial.
The chief cities are Corduba the Royal seat of the Moorish Kings: here were
borne Lucan and both the Seneca's.

Duosque Senecas, unicumque Lucanum,
Foecunda loquitur Corduba.
Corduba glorying in her fruitful field,
One Lucan, and two Seneca's did yield.
This city is vulgarly called Cordova, and hence comes our true Cordovan
leather, made of the skin of a Sardinian beast. Near unto this city is a wood
of 30 miles in length, having nothing but Olive trees: and not far hence by
the Village called Munda, Florus.
was fought that notable battle between Caesar, and the sons of Pompey.
The honor of the day fell unto Caesar, who then made an end of the civil
wars, which that very day four years before, were begun by Pompey the
Father. In this battle Cneius Pompeius was slain, and his strength broken;
Neither did Caesar escape without great loss, he never being before so put to
his last trumpe: for seeing his soldiers give back, he resolutely maintained
the fight, bidding them remember they had at Munda forsaken their General.
Shame, and his noble example, encouraged the soldiers to a new onset, which
was honored with the tropheyes of victory. This was the last field that Caesar
ever was in, he being not long after, murdered in the Senate House. In other
places he used to say, he fought for honor; in this for his life. 2. Marchena
where the best Iennets are, not of this Province alone, but of all Spain: the
river Baetis (as it is thought) conveying some secret virtue unto them. Of this
race was the horse which Caesar so loved, that at his death he erected his
statue in the Temple of Venus: And the ancient Lusitani thought they were
engendered by the wind. 3. Medina Sidonia, whose Duke was Captain General of
the invincible Armado 1588. 4 Lucar di Barameda a great Haven Town, at which
the man which either was the true Sebastian King of Portugal, Hist. of Sp.
or else would so have bin accounted, arrived in a Galley from Naples, where he
had bin kept in a dark dungeon three days without any sustenance, but a knife
and a halter. If man^ judgments durst herein be free, I could say that the
arguments la^d down in the Spanish History on this behalf, are both
unanswered, and better then such as were brought against him. But he has bin
now long dead, and therefore let all the probabilities and suspicions of his
being the same man, be buried with him: though certain it is, that the
Spaniards used to say, that either he was the true Sebastian, or the devil in
his likeness. 5 Xeres a sea-town also, whence come our Xeres sack, commonly
called Sherrie sacks. 6. Tariffa seated at the end of the promontorie toward
Afric, and so called, because Tariff the leader of the Moors into Spain,
here landed, And 7. Seuill the fairest city not of Andaluzia alone, but of all
Spain. It is in compass six miles, environed with beautiful walls, and
adorned with many magnificent and stately buildings of Palaces, Churches, and
Monasteries; amongst which, that of the Gertosins is endowed with 25000 crowns
of yearly revenue. Under the jurisdiction of this city are no less then 20000
small Villages. It is also a most flourishing University, Lewk^or of cities.
wherein studied Avicen the Moore that excellent and learned Scholar; Pope
Silvester the second, and Leander. Famous also is it for two provincial
Councels holden here, the first Ao 584, the last Ao 636, and also that here are
continually maintained 30000 Gennets for the service of the King. The river
Baetis divides it into two parts, both joined together by a stately and
beautiful bridge. Hist. of Sp*
It was recovered by Fernand the 2 of Castile, Ao 1248. from hence come our

lastly, here is the body of Christopher Columbus with this (I cannot say
worthy) Epitaph. Quade.

I Christopher Columbus whom the land
Of Genoa first brought forth, first took in hand
(I know not by what Deity incited)
To scull the Western waves, and was delighted
To find such coasts as were unknown before;
The Event was good, for I descried the shore
Of the new World, that it might learn to obey
Philip, which over the Spanish should bear sway;
And yet I greater matters left behind
For men of more means, and a brauer mind.
Maginus.
The custom of this town only is worth unto the King half a million of gold
yearly. The revenues of the Archbishop hereof are 100000 crowns yearly, as
having in his whole Diocese 2000 Benefices, besides Frieries, Nunneries,
Hospitals. He is next in degree to the Archbishop of Tolledo, and is the
Metropolitan of Andaluzia, and the Fortunate Islands. Isidore so much renowned
for his sincerity and profoundnesse in learning, was Bishop here, who is
usually called Isidorus Hispalensis, to distinguish him from another of that
name, called Pelusietae.

2 GRANADA is bounded with Marcia on the East, Andaluzia on the West, Castile
North, and the Mediterranean South. Lewknor.
The chief Cities are Granada, a fine and stately Town, whence come our
Granada stockings. The houses hereof are built all of curious free stone, with
delicate and artificial masonry, showing great magnificence. It is replenished
within with abundance of wholesome and pleasing springs, and fenced without
with a strong wall, in which are 12 gates, and 130 turrets. Here is still to be
seen the palace of the Moorish kings, an excellent and magnificent structure
covered over with gold, and indented with Mosaicall work, This City is the
ordinary Parliament and Court of Justice for all the Southern parts of Spain,
in like manner as Valadolit is for the North; Madrid like the high Parliament
of Paris, having jurisdiction over, and receiving appeals from both. 2 Alamia
famous for her bathes. 3 Malaga or Malaca, Plutarch.
a town sacked by Crassus the rich Roman who flying into Spain to avoid the
fury of Marius and Cinna, who had slain his father and uncle, hid himself and
his companions eight months together in a cave; but having intelligence of
their deaths, he issued out, and ransacked amongst many other cities, this
Malaga. From hence come our Malaga Sackes: and to the great prejudice of the
Moors was this Town taken by Fernand the Catholic 1487. ^4 Alm^ri^ a great
Hauen-towne. 5. Osuna.

3 ESTREMEDVRA has on the East and North Castile, on the West Portugal, on the
South Vandaluzia, it was once called Baeturia from the Baetis which runs
through it. The chief cities are 1 Merida (formerly called Augusta Emerita)
nigh unto which was the battle between Val^^a King of the Goths, and Atace
King of the Alani, and Vandals (surnamed Silinges:) the victory whereof falling
to the Goths, caused the Vandals to leave their first footing in Spain. This
town sprung from the ruin of Norba Caesarea, which by Petronius and Afranius,
two of Pompeyes captains, was laid even with the ground, for adhering
faithfully to Julius Caesar. It was built and made a Colonie by Augustus, who
placing in it his old soldiers, whom the Latins call Emeriti, gave it the
name of Augusta Emerita. 2 Guadalcanall famous for mines of gold and silver.
The first Incola were the Vestones. It was taken from the Moors 1147.

The Saracens having made almost a plenarie conquest of Spain, and utterly
subverted the Gothish kingdom, were first subject unto the Caliphs of Babylon,
but after some few years, the vast Empire of the Saracens ouer-burdened by its
own weight, began to bend downwards; and the Sultans who by institution, were
but Vicegerents to the Mahumetan Pope of Bagdet, invested themselves with the
wreathes of royal authority: every one plucking some feathers from this
Arabian Peacocke to hide his own nakedness withal. In this confusion the
more potent Saracens of Spain, fortified themselves as they best could, making
as many Kingdoms as Cities, and almost as many Cities as towns. Yet did the
more splendide Sun of Majesty shine in the Sphere of Corduba.

After the death of this Mahomet, the kingdom of Corduba was tossed with
diverse fortunes, as being sometimes under the protection, sometimes the command
of the Kings of F^z and Morocco: but always supported by the Africans against
the Christians in Spain, till at last the kingdom was ruinated by King
Fernand of Castile, 1236. after it had flourished under 20 Kings almost 260
years. Bara.
The Arms of the Realm of Corduba were Or, a Lion Gules, armed and crowned of
the first: a border Azrue, charged with 8 towers Argent. Corduba thus taken,
the Moors fly to Granada, and there renew their strength and kingdom: Which
kingdom, how and when it ended, we shall not be long before we tell you. As
for the name and Nation of Moors, it continued in Spain even until our time;
most of that people professing, or at least, seeming to profess the Christian
Religion. But in the year 1609, to the number of a million of them and
upwards, going about to free themselves from the danger of the Inquisition, and
to rec^uer their old liberty again: gave just occasion to the kings of Spain,
to use that hard point of severity toward them, which he afterward did,
banishing the whole Nation out of his dominions for ever; when this had bin to
them their native soil for almost 900 years. The Moorish Kings of Granada.

Moors in Spain; Hist. of Sp.
For as the kingdom of Granado began under a Mahomet, a Fernand King of
Castile: so it ended under a Mahomet, a Fernand being King of Castile. In the
tenth year of this man's reign, about the year 1492. the Empire of the Moors
ended in Spain, by the valor of Ferdinand the Catholic, and Isabel his
wife, after their first entrance into it more then 760 years. Such as after
the decay of their kingdom stayed in Spain, were by a statute in that case
provided, to be Christened; and that they might be known to be as they
professed, the Inquisition was ordained, consisting of a certain number of
Dominican Friars; who finding such counterfeiting Christians, were first gently
to reprove and exh^rt them, and after if no amendment followed, to inflict some
mulct upon them. This custom in it self was wondrous tolerable and laudable;
but from the Moors it is turned on the Protestants, and that with such
violence and extremity of torture, that it is counted the greatest tyranny and
seuerest kind of persecution under heaven: Insomuch that many Papists who would
willingly die for their Religion, abhor the very name and mention, and to the
death withstand the bringing in of this slavery among them. This is it that
made the people of Arragon and Naples rebel, countries where the people are
all of the Papal side: and this was it which caused the irremediable revolt of
the Low Countries; the greatest part of that nati^n at the time of their taking
arms, Sauds rela^. of Relig.
being Catholics. Yet is it planted and established in Spain, and all Italy,
( Naples and Venic^ excepted.) This racking of men's consciences is committed to
the most zealous, fiery and rigorous Friars in the whole pack. The least
suspicion of heresy, affinity, or commerce with Heretics, reproving the lives
of the Clergy, keeping any books, or editions of books prohibited; or
discoursing in matters of Religion, are offenses sufficient. Nay they will
charge men's consciences under pain of damnation, to detect their nearest and
dearest friends, if they do but suspect them to be herein culpable. Their
proceedings are with great secrecy and severity: for 1. the parties accused,
shall never know their accuser, but sh^lbe constrained to reveal their own
thoughts and affections. 2ly if they are but convinced of any error in any of
their opinions, or be gainsaied by two witnesses, they are immediately
condemned: 3l^ if nothing can be proved against them, yet shall they with
infinite tortures and miseries be kept in the house diverse years, for a
terror to others: and 4ly if they escape the first brunt with many torments
and much anguish; yet the second questioning or suspicion, brings death
remediless. And as for torments and kinds of death, Phalaris and his
fellow-tyrants, come far short of these bloud-hounds. Each of those
Inquisitors is honored with the title of Lord, and are a great terror to the
neighboring Peazants. There goes a tale, how one of their Lordships desiring
to eat of the pears which grew in a poor man's Orchard not far off, sent
for him to come unto him: which put the poor Swain into such a fright, that
he fell sick, and kept his bed. Being afterward informed that his pears were
the cause of his Lordships message, he plucked up the tree by the roots,
carrying it with all the fruit on it unto him: and when he was demanded the
reason of that vnhusbandly action; he protested that he would never keep that
thing in his house which should give any of their Lordships a further occasion
to send for him.


The Arms of Granada are Or, a Pomegrauat slipped Vert.

4. GALLICIA.
Gallicia has on the East the Asturia's, on the West and North the Sea, on the
South the river Minius. The former Inhabitants were of Gallaici, whence the
name is derived. The Country is like that of the Asturias, mountainous, and
almost inaccessible; and so the fitter to hold out against foreign invasions,
and to defend the person of its own Princes, and the common liberty.

The chief Cities are 1 Compostella, vulgarly called St Iago, in the honor of
Saint James, who lies here buried, and of whom there is an order of Knights.
Lewknor.
In a Church of this town are kept the relics of Saint James, which are to
this day worshipped with incredible devotion, and visited with a wonderful
concourse of people. This Church has no Bishop, but is immediately under the
Pope. This Church also did Charles the great, make one of the three seats
Apostolic, the other two being St Peter's in Rome, and St John's in Ephesus.
This town is also an University. 2 Baiona at the mouth of Minius, and 3
Corenna, not far from the Promontory Nerius. This town is that which is
called the Groyne, so often mentioned i^ our last wars with the Spaniards.

When the Vandals made their first inrodes into Spain, Hist. of Sp.
there entered with them a people called the Suevi, who, according to the
division made between them, the Vandals, and Alani: laid hands on this
Province, under the conduct of Hermeric the first king. The third king Reccaire
did receive the Christian Faith, and with it also Arrianisme: he surprised
Navarre and Arragon; but could not defend his own country from Theodoricke
the Gothe; who after gave the Gallicians leave to choose a new King. Hereupon
ensued diverse bloody factions betwixt the more potent of the Nobility, till at
last the honor fell on Arismund. Finally after this kingdom had endured 177
years, it was subdued by Leonigild a king of the Goths. It was again made a
kingdom by Alphonso the great of Leon, and by him given to his son Ordogno,
Ao 886. and was again incorporated to Leon by Alphonso the sixth, who wrested it
from Don Garcia, Bara.
1081. The Arms of this kingdom were Azure, Semie of cross crosset; fitchee,
a Chalice covered Or.

5. BISCAIE.
BISCAIE called formerly Cantabria, is betwixt Navarre East, old Castile South,
Leon West, and the Cantabrian Ocean North. Mercator.
It took name from the Vascones, part of which people when they le^t their old
seats, came into this country; naming it first Viscaia, then Viscaia, and now
Biscaia.

The chief Cities are 1 Tholosa. 2. Saint Sebastians. 3 F^nterabia both parts
on the Sea. 4 Bilbo (anciently called Flavionavia) two miles distant from the
Maine; it abounds with good wines, much cattle, the best bread, and tried
blades, called Bilbo blades. It is a town of great traffic, and consequently
of great riches, here being many private men which yearly build three or four
ships.

The Country is mountainous and woodie, out of whose hills arise 150 Rivers, of
which Iberus and Duerus are the chief. Here is excellent timber to build
ships, and such an abundance of iron, that it is called The Armorie of Spain.

The people of this Province use a language different from the rest of Spain,
and is reported to have continued without great alteration, since the confusion
at Babel. Brerewood.
That it is of this age, I will not stand to prove; though an argument hereof
may be, the small or no affinity it has with other tongues, Yet that it was
the ancient language of Spain, is more then probable, because this people have
ever continued without any mixture of foreign Nations; as being never
thoroughly subdued either by Romans, Carthaginians, Goths, or Moors; and so
they remained, as in their liberties not mastered; so in their language not
altered In like manner the Arabique continues vncorrupt in the hilly parts of
Granada; the tongue of the old Britains in our Wales, and the ancient
Epirotique, in the high and woodie parts of that country. Neither do these
Biscaines differ from the rest of Spain in language, but in customs also,
three of which I will set down as a light to the rest. First they account
themselves free from taxes, and contributions to the kings of Spain, yielding
them obedience with their bodies, but not with their purses. And when any of
the Spanish kings in their progresses come to the Frontiers of this Country,
he bareth one of his legs, and in that manner enters into it. There he is met
by the Lords and Gentlemen there dwelling, who proffe^ him some few small
brass pieces ( Marauidis they call them, whereof 600 go to a crown) in a
leatherne bag, hanging at the end of a lance; but with all they tell him that
he must not take them. This ceremony performed, they all attend the king in
his journey, and this I learned from a Gentleman, who has spent some time in
this Country. A good place for Puritan^ to dweilin.
2ly they admit no Bishops to come amongst them; and when Fernand the
Catholic came in progress hither, accompanied amongst others, by the Bishop
of Pampelune: the people arose in arms, drove back the Bishop, and gathering
all the dust on which they thought he had trodden, slung it into the Sea. 3ly
The women at all meetings do first drink; a custom which has continued ever
since Ogn^ Countess of Castilc, would have poisoned her son Sancho.

The ancient inhabitants were the Cantabri, a people of that courage, that they
defended the liberty of their Country against the Romans, when the residue of
Spain was subdued; and were at last not without great effusion of blood, and
manifest tokens of manly resolution, and Heroic spirits, on their parts;
vanquished by the darling of Fortune, Augustus. Such hilly and mountainous
people are always the last that are conquered, and the first that stand on
their own guard, as besides these Biscanies, the Navarroys and Asturians here
in Spain, in respect of the Moors: and our Britains in relation to the
Saxons. Whether it be, that living in a sharp air, and being inured to
labor, they prove on occasion, good and able men: or that the Forts of Natures
own building, are not so easily won, as defended: or that the unpleasantness
of the Country, and vhfruitfulnesse of the soil, yield no occasion to
strangers to desire and adventure for it, I cannot determine. Hist. of Sp.
These Biscanies were the last also that submitted to the fury of the Moors,
whom shortly after they drove thence by the valor of Soria a Noble Scot 870;
whose posterity enjoyed this proprietary Lordship, till that Nero of Spain,
Don Pedro, violently took it from the true Heir, Donna Jane, and her Husband,
1358.

6. TOLLEDO.
TOLLEDO is now accounted as a city of ntw Castile: The kingdom embraced the
Town and Territories extending over the Southeast of Castile, now called Campo
de Calatrava, and so downward toward Murcia. Lewknor.
This Country was of old the ^eate of the Carpentani. The chief city is
Tolledo, seated on the river Tagus: it is beautified with many palaces of rare
and excellent architecture; and fortified with 150 towers standing on the walls.
It is seated in the very center almost of Spain, and is passing well
inhabited, as well by Noblemen who reside there for pleasure; by merchants who
resort thither for commodity; and by men of war who are garrisoned there for
the defense of it. This city was taken by the Moors at their first entrance
into Spain, Hist. of Sp.
715. they therein behauing themselves more advisedly in striking first at the
head, then could be expected of such Barbarians. It was first under the
Mahumetan Calyphs, and their Vicegerents; after it became a peculiar kingdom,
and was taken from Haia Alcadu^bir the last king, by Alphonso the first, king
of Castile, 1083. This City was the seat of the Gothish Kings, one of which
viz. Bamba, walled this town.

Erexis (fautore Deo) Rex inclytus urbem
Bamba, suae celebrem protendens gentis honorem.
King Bamba (God assisting) walled this Town,
Extending so the ancient Goths renown.
Next it was the fear of the Moorish Princes; and now of the Archbishops, who
are the chief Prelates of Spain, and Presidents for the most of the
Inquisition. Their revenewes are certainly the greatest of any spiritual
Prince, except the Popes, as mounting to the yearly value of 300000 Crowns.
This City is honored with an University, famous for the study of the Civil and
Common Laws; as also with 18 National Councels here held under the Gothish
kings. The next City of any note is Calatrava, on the river Ana, famous for its
order of Knights. It stands on, or near unto the place where in former times
stood the strong and famous city Castulo; Plutarch.
which being under the command of the Romans, was by the Gyresoeni, a people
that dwelt on the other side of the river, suddenly entered and taken. But
Sertorius entering after them at the same gate, put the^ to the sword; and
causing his men to apparel themselves in the clothes of their slain enemies,
he led them to the chief Cities of the Gyresoeni; where the people supposing
them to be their companions, opened their gates, and were all either slain or
sold for slaves. The third town of note is Talbora, vulgarly called Talveira
di Roina, a very neat and sweet town, seated on the Tagus.

The Arms are B, Guillin^.
a crown mitrall imperial O, garnished with sundry precious gemmes proper.

7. MVRCIA.
MVRCIA was in former times a very rich and profitable country, Maginus.
stoored with all fruits of the earth, and so abounding in silver mines, that
the Romans who were then Lords of it, kept continually 400 men here at work,
and received the profit of 25000 Drachmas daily. It is environed with New
Castile, or the kingdom of Tolledo, West; Granada South; Valentia North; and
the Mediterranean East. The chief towns are 1 Alicante a fair harbor;, from
whence we have our true Alicant wine, made of the juice of mulberries which are
here growing in great plenty. 2 Murcia (by Ptolomie called Murgis) on the river
Segourg, Hist. of Sp.
from whence the whole country is named. 3 Nova Ca^thag^, or Cartagona, built
by Asdrubal of Carthage, and ruined in the second Punick war, Florus.
by Scipio Africanus; a man of that rare chastity, that during all his wars in
Spain, he would not permit any of the young Virgins of the Country to be
brought before him, least his eyes should betray his heart. It is now famous
for the Haven which it has, very capacious, and of that safety, that that
worthy Sea Captain Andreas Doria, Admiral unto Charles the fifth, used to say,
that there were but three safe ports in the Mediterranean, which were
Cartagena, August and July: meaning, as I conceive, that those two months being
commonly free from winds and tempests, were no less secure to mariners then
the port of Cartagena. See, I beseech you, the privilege of authority and
antiquity; for had a meaner man spoke this in those times, or a greater man in
these wherein we live: neither the one nor the other would have bin remembered
for it. But one inch of greatness, and another of age, has I perceive, the
prerogative to put such saplesse and unworthy conceits upon the Register, which
in our days would either not be observed, or else scorned.

Leonigild the Gothe took this Country from the Romance: and it was recovered
from Alboquis the last Moorish King, by Fernand of Castile 1241. The chief
river of this Country is Guadala quir.

8. CASTILE.
CASTILE is bounded on the East with Navar, Arragon, and the Country of
Tolledo; on the West with Portugal; on the North with the Asturias; on the
South with Andaluzia and Granada. This was the most prevailing kingdom to
which the rest were all united, either by conquest, or inter-marriages. It is
now divided into the New and the Old.

The Old Castile is situate on the North of the New. The chief Cities are, 1
Soriae or Numantia, in which 4000 Soldiers withstood 40000 Romans, for
fourteen years. During which time having valiantly repulsed, Florus.
and forced them unto two dishonorable compositions, they at last resolved on a
strange and desperate end. For gathering all their armor, money and goods
together, they laid them on a pile, which being fired, they voluntarily buried
themselves in the flame: leaving Scipio nothing but the bare name of Numantia
to adorn his triumph. 2 Segouia, a Town famous for clothing. Lewknor.
3 Valadolit, a neat fine Town, and an University. It was reckoned one of the
7 ancient Universities of Spain, but afterward falling to decay, it was
restored by king Philip the 2d, whose birth place it was; and who erected here
a College among others for the education of young English fugitives, 4 Avila,
called formerly Abule, of which Tostatus was Bishop, and is therefore called
Abulensis. He was, as the Epistle to his works informs me, President of the
Council to John the 2d, King of Arragon; and will be eternally famous for his
learned and paineful Commentaries on the Bible: for so great they are, that it
is supposed (if we had all his works) that he wrote as many sheets as he lived
days; and for the worth of them take along with you this eulogie which
Casaubon in his work against Baronius, affords him, Lando acumen viri si in
meliora incidisset tempora long maximi. 5 Burgos built, or rather repaired by
Nugno Belides a German; this Town contendeth with Tolledo for the Primacy of
Spain. Hist. of Sp.
6. Salamanca, the famousest Academy of this Country, instituted by Fernand of
Castile, Anno 1240; and was by the edicts of the Popes, together with Oxford,
Paris, and Bononia, created a Generale studium, wherein should be Professors
of the Hebrew, Chaldaicke, and Arabicke tongues.

The ch^efe Rivers of this Province, are Kelannos rising nigh to Furgos. 2.
Tormes gliding by Salamanca. 3. Duerus the most violent river of all Spain.

The New Castile is on the South of the Old. The chief cities there are,
Boterus.
1 Madrid the Kings seat, whose residence, though the Count^y be neither
fruitful nor pleasant, has made that place of a Village, the most populous
Town of all Spain. It is a custom, that except some composition be made, all
the upper stories belong to the King. 2 Alcala de Henares (of old Complutum) an
University famous for the study of Divinity. 3 Alcantara, of which there is an
order of Knights. 4 Signeuca, a small Academy. 5. Cuenca, seated at the spring
head of the river Xucar. Here also is the Escuriall or Monastery of S.
Laurence, built by King Philip the second. A place (says Quade, who spends
13 pages in its description) of that magnificence, that no building in times
past, or this present, is comparable to it. The front toward the West is
adorned with three stately gates, the middlemost whereof leads into a most
magnificent Temple; a Monastery in which are 150 Monk^s of the order of S.
Jerome, and a College: that on the right hand opens into diverse offices
belonging to the Monastery; that on the left unto schools and outhouses
belonging to the College. At the four corners, there are four turrets of
excellent workmanship, and for height majesticall. Toward the North is the
Kings Palac^: on the South part diverse beautiful and sumptuous galleries; and
on the East side sundry gardens and walls very pleasing and delectable. It
contains in all 11 several quadrangles, every one incloystred: and is indeed
so brave a structure, that a voyage into Spain were well employed, were it
only to see it and return.

The chief rivers are, 1 Tagus. 2. Xaruma honored with the neighborhood of
Madrid and 3 Yauina.

The old inhabitants of these Castiles, were the Vaccai, Ventones, Carpentani,
Oretani, Bastitani, Dittani, etc. From none of which the name of Castile can
be deduced; so that we must fetch it either from the Castellani, once the
inhabitants of Catelogne, or from some strong fortified Castle in these parts.
This last conjecture may seem probable, because the Arms of this kingdom are
Guies, a Castle triple-towred Or: Neither is it any way strange for Provinces,
especially smaller ones (for such at the first this was, though now much
exte^ded both in bounds and power) to take their names from a Castle. For (to
go no farther) even with us, Richmondshire, was so called from the castle of
Richmond, there built by Alaine Earl of Britain: and Flintshire took
denomination from a Castle built of flintstones by Henry the 2d. We may see
hereby how much Celius Secundus Curio was deceived, who writes that Alphonso
the third having overthrown Mahomet Enasir the King of Morocco and Granada,
and put 60000 of his men to the sword: assumed these Arms, that thus named
this kingdom, which was before called the kingdom of the Bastitanes; because
that victory like a strong castle (forsooth) confirmed his kingdom unto him.
And for the former Etimologie it appears most evidently, in that the people
are by the Latins called Castellani, the Country Castella.

Hist. of Sp.
Castile was an Earldom under the command of Leon, till the days of Sancho
the first, whose substitute in this Country was then one Fernand Gonsales: who
coming bravely accompanied to the Court of Leon, sold unto the king Sancho an
Hauk and an Horse of excellent kinds, on this condition; that if at a day
appointed, the money agreed on were not paid, it should be doubled and redoubled
every day till the payment. This money by the negligence of the Kings Officers,
grew so great a sum; that to satisfy Gonsales, the King made him the
Proprietary Earl of Castile 939. The heir to the fifth Proprietary Earl, was
Donna Nugna married to Sancho the great of Navarre, 1208: by whom this
Earldom was made a Kingdom, and given to Ferdinand his son, 1034.

beginning.
There are in these kingdoms of Castile and Leon three principal orders of
Knighthood. Grimston.


Of S Iago; instituted according to Mariana by the Canons of Eloy, and
confirmed by Alexander the third, 1175. Their ensign is a Red cross l^ke a
sword. Others make K. Raymir of Leon the founder, anno 948; and some refer it
to Ferdinand of Castile, 1170.

2 Of Calatrava; a Town abandoned by the Templers, to whom it was given by
Sancho of Castile, 1158, and defended against the Sarracens by Raimund Abbot of
Pisoria He began this order, confirmed by Pope Alexander the 3, 1164: their
Roabe is white, on their breasts a red Cross.

3 Alcantara; a town of new Castile, defended by Fernand of L^on, against the
M^ores, where he framed this order, confirmed by Pope Lucio, 1183. Their devise
is a Peare-tree Vert in a field Or to which hanged a pair of Shackles, as a
sign of their subjection to them of Calatraua. These Arms were changed anno
1411, into a white Roabe and a green cross on t^eir breasts. These orders, as
also the Templers of St John, of the Sepulcher, and the ^ike, are by M Seldom
(and that deservedly) thought unfit, to be put among titles Honorary; in that
what they do is in a certain place, and for a stipend. I omit the order of
the Dove and Reason instituted by John of Castile.

9. PORTVGALL.
Maginus.
PORTVGALL is bounded on the North with the river Minius: on the South with the
river Ana: on the West with the Ocean: and on the East by the Castiles. It is
so called from the Haven town Port^, at the mouth of Duerus; where the Gaule^
used to land with their Merchandise: which was therefore called Por^us
Gallorum, and since the whole Country Portugal. The former name hereof was
Lusitania, and by the old Romans it was divided into Vlteriorem, lying beyond
Duerus North; Citeriorem lying from Tagus South; and Interamnem situate
between these two rivers.

Ortelius.
The air is very healthful; the Country for the most part hilly and bare of
corn: which defect is recompensed with the abundance of Honey, Wine, Oil,
Alum, Fruits, Fish, white Marble, Salt, etc. It contains 1460 Parishes, and
is in compass 870 miles; the length 320; the breadth 60. The fruitfullest part
of all the Country is about Conimbra.

The people hereof are of more plain and simple behavior the^ the rest of
Spain: and if we believe the proue^biall speech, none of the wisest: For
whereas the Spaniards are said to seem wise and are fools; the French to
seem fools and are wise: the Italians to seem and be wise: the Portugalls
are affirmed neither to be wise, nor so much as to seem so* and not much
different from this the Spaniards have a proverb, which tells us that the
Portugalls are Pocos y locos, few and foolish. They have a natural antipathy
to the Spaniards, for bereauing them both of liberty and glory. They are
excel^ent Seafaring men, and happy in foreign discouer^es.

Rivers it has great and small almost 200. The chief are 1 Minius, full of
red Lead, which is navigable 100 miles. 2 Duerus. 3 Lethes now Cavada. 4
Mulia^as now Mondego. 5 Tagus, and 6 Ana, these two last common to the rest of
Spain.

The ancient ^^colae were the Oretani, Lubeni, Velionet, etc. The chief Cities
are Lisbon upon Tagus, a famous City for traffic, the Portugals in all their
navgations setting to sea (...) hence. The Latin Writers call it Olisippo, and
Vlisippo, because as some say, Ulysses in his ten years travels coming
hither, built it. But this is improbable, it being nowhere found that Ulysses
did ever see the Ocean; and likely it is, that this town being conveniently
seated for navigation, and inhabited at the first by seafaring men, might be
consecrated or dedicated, as it were to the memory of that notable traveler
Ulysses: as Athons being a place of war and learning, was to Minerva, whom
the Greeks call Athenae. L^wknor.
It is in compass 7 miles, and contains upwards of 20000 houses, all of neat
and elegant building. Towers and turrets it numbreth on the walls about 67,
gates toward the sea shore 22, and 16 toward the Continent. Finally it was
taken from the Moors by Alphonso the first King of this Country, 1147. 2
Miranda, 3 Braga the Metropolitan of Portugal, an Archi-episcopall See, and a
Dukes honor, 4 Co^imbra a famous University, the Masters of which, made the
Commentary upon the most part of Aristotle, Mercator.
called Schola Conimbricensis. 5* Porto, or Portus Gallorum.

At the Southern end of Portugal stands Algarue, called of old, Regnum
Algarbiorum: The chief Towns are Favila. 2 Faro. and 3 Silvis. The utmost end
of it was anciently called Prem^ntorium Sacrum, and now the Cape of S. Vincent,
because the bones of S. Vincent, religously preserved by the Christians, were
here burnt and scattered about by the Saracens, Hist. of Sp.
who were the possessours of this Province. These gave way to the good fortune
of the Kings of Leon, to whose Crown this little country belonged: till
Alphonso the tenth of that name in Leon, and fourth in Castile gave it in dowry
with Beatrix his daughter, to Alphonso the third, King of Portugal. From this
conjunction issued Dionysius or Denis King of Portugal, who was the first that
ever used the title of Rex Algarbiorum, 1274.

That part of Portugal which remained free from the Moors, was given by
Alphonso the sixth of Leon, in dowry with his base daughter Teresa, to Henry of
Lorreine, whose virtue in the discipline of war, merited no less a reward,
Ao 1099. He having governed fortunately as Earl, the space of 12 years, le^^
his son Alphonso heir to his virtues and possesions, who had title of King
of Portugal, conferred on him by the Sovereigns of Leon, for demeaning
himself so bravely in the battle of Obrique Ao 1139. He had before the
assumption of this regal title, ruled in these parts 27 years; and after he
was created king, he reigned here with great honor, as being reverenced by his
friends, and feared by his enemies; no less then 45 years. So that the whole
time of his sitting in the Chair of Estate was 72 years; a longer enjoying of
sovereignty then ever any Prince since the beginning of the Roman Monarchy
attained to. Pr^opius.
One I meet with, which fell short of this time two years only, namely
Sapores the son of Mislates king of Persia; but in one thing he went beyond
Alphonso, beginning his reign before his life. For his Father dying, left his
mother with child, and the Persian Nobility set the Crown on his mothers belly,
acknowledging thereby her issue for their Prince, before she as yet had felt
her self quick.

King elect.
But 1580 19 Philip the 2d of Spain, pretended a right to the Crown of
Portugal, and though he made show it should be lawfully debated, to whom it
truly appertained; yet meaning to make sure work, he made Cannons and Sword his
Orators, by maine force took it, and so keeps it.


The Pretendants to the Crown of Portugal were 1 Philip of Spain. 2 Emanuel
of Savoy. 3 Antonio Prior of Crato, (who though a bastard, had yet a sentence
of legitimation) 4 Rain^ccio Farnesis, son to the Duke of Parma. 5 John the
Duke of Bragance. Their several pretensions appear^ by this subsequent
Genealogy.

Emanuel had these children 1 John King of Portugal John Prince of Portugal
Sebastian king of Portugal.

2 Henry the Cardinal, king of Portugal. 3 Lewis Don Antonio a Bastard.
Christopher yet living.

4 Edward 1 Mary wedded to the Duke of Parma Rainnocio Farnesis.
2 Catharine married to John D. of Bragance.
5 Mary married to Charles the fifth, king of Castile. Philip the II. king of
Spain.
6 Beatrix married to Charles Duke of Savoy.


Where the right is, may as easily be discerned, as it is generally known
where is the possession. Thus after the death, or if not death, yet overthrow
of Sebastian, in that battle of Africa, where three kings fell in a day; the
royal line of Portugal which began in a Henry, made its period in a Henry: and
that flourishing kingdom was constrained to stoop to the Spaniards, of whose
Garland, it is accounted the chiefest flower; and the chiefest pearl of his
Cabinet: The king of Spain in right of this kingdom, possessing much in
Barbary, Aethiopia, and the East Indies: And in the right hereof, commanding
all the Seacoast from the streights of Gibraltare, unto the Red seas mouth;
from thence along the Arabian shore, unto the I Will of Ormus, and so to Cape
Liampo, in the Indies.

The Arms of Portugal are Argent, on five Escotcheons Azure, as many Besants
in Saltier of the first, pointed Sable, within a border Gules, Grimston.
charged with seven Towers Or. The five Escotcheons were given in remembrance
of five kings, whom Alphonso slew at the battle of Obrique Ao 1139,

The principal order of this kingdom, is of JESUS CHRIST, instituted by Denis
king of Portugal, and confirmed by Pope John the 22d, anno 1321. Their duty was
to expel the Saracous from Baetica: they have much enlarged the Portugal
dominion in India, Brasil, and Mauritania. Their Robe is a black Cloak, under
a white vesture, over which a black Cross, etc.

10 VALENTIA.
VALENTIA is environed with Arragon, Ortelius.
Castile, Murela, and the Sea. It is watered with the rivers 1 Xuear, called of
old Sueron, and Surus. 2 Guadalander, signifying a river of pure water, and 3
M^llar. The former inhabitants werr the Bast^ani, Aeliani, etc.

The chief cities are Valentia, giving name to the whole Province. It is
situate not far from the mouth of the river Derias, now called Guadalander,
and is by some said to have been heretofore named Roma, which signifies
strength. But when the Romans mastred it, to distinguish it from their Rome,
it was called Valentia, which in the Latin tongue is of the same signification
with the Greek (...). Here is an University in which St Dominicke the father
of the Dominicans studied. 2 Laurigi now a small Village, Plutarch.
once a town of great strength, called Lauron, which Sertorius besieged, took
and burned; even then when Pompey, whose confederate the Laur^nites were, stood
with his whole army nigh enough unto the flame to warm his hands, and yet
durst not succor it. 3 Cullera a sea-town standing at the mouth of the river
Xucar. It was formerly named Sucron, after the name of the river; and is famous
in story for the victory which Sertorius here got of Pompey, Pompey's army
being not only overthrown, but himself with life hardly escaping. 4 Morvedre
anciently Saguntum, a town so faithful to the Romans, that the people being
besieged by Hannibal, chose rather to burn themselves, then yield. 5 Segorbe.

Here is the Promontorie Terraria, once called Pr^m^nterium Dionium, the refuge
of the aboue-named Sertorius, that worthy Captain, in his wars against
Metellus and Pomp^y, both brave soldiers; the first aged, and of great
experience; the second young, and of high resolutions; yet the former gave
greater check to Sertorius proceedings, than the latter: so that Sertorius
oftentimes said, that were it not for the old woman Metellus, he would have
whipped the boy Pompey home with rods. For he twice overcame this great Pompey,
the first time dangerously wounding him, the second time driving him out of the
field. But when Pompey and Metellus joined, he was ouer-matched, and yet seemed
to retire out of the field rather then to fly. Certainly the Spaniards behaved
themselves very valiantly all the time of these wars under him, to which
Florus alludeth, saying; Nec nunquam magis apparuit Hispani militis vigor,
quane Romano duce. At the last when he had a long time vpheld the Marian
faction, he was traiterous^y murdered by Perpenna one of his associates; and
Metellus and Pompey returned in triumph to Rome: so much was the casual death
of this poor Proscript esteemed.

This kingdom was taken from the Moors by James the first of Arragon, Bara.
Ao 1238. The arms were Gules, a town embattailed Argent, purfled (or pennond)
Sable.

11. CATELOGNE.
CATELOGNE is between Iberus on the South, Arragon on the West, the Sea on the
East, and the Pyrenaan mountains on the North.

The present name Catalonia is diversely derived, some bringing it from
Gothalonia of the Goths, Hist. of Sp.
and Alani; Some from the Castellani the old inhabitants hereof; others from
Cattalones, who also had their dwellings here; others from the Catti of
Germany, and the Alani; and some finally from Carthalot a Noble man of this
Country: of these opinions, all of which (the last excepted) are equally
probable, it matters not which is taken.

The chief Cities are 1 Girone, the title of the Arragonian Prince, seated on
the river, Baetulus. 2 Barcelone on the Sea, a town of good strength and
antiquity, as rising out of the ruins of Rubicata, an old Colony of the
Africans, before the coming of the Romans into Spain. It has belonging unto
it an indifferent fair Haven, and is the seat of the Vicegerent. 3 Perpigna
(called in Iohnsons Map of Spain, Perpinha) in the County of Rossillon. This
town and the Country was pawned by John king of Arragon 1462. to Lewis the 11th
of France, for 300000 Crowns: and restored to Fernand the Catholic by
Charles the 8th 1493, that he might uot be hindered in his journey to Naples.
Francis the first, king of France, partly to requite the Emperor Charles the
5. for the war he made in Provence; and partly to get into his hands a town,
which is as it were one of the doors of Spain: sent his son Henry (afterward
King) with a puissant army to force it, Ao 1542. But the town was so well
fortified, so bravely manned, and so abundantly stored with munition, that this
journey proved as fruitless and dishonorable to the French king: as the
invasion of Province, and siege of Marseiles, had bin before to the Emperor.

Hist. of Sp.
The first Earl of this Country was one Bernard, by the grant of Charles the
great, 795. It continued a principality of its own power, till Raymund Earl
hereof, marrying Petronilla, daughter and heir to Don Raymir of Arragon;
united this Earldom to that Kingdom, Ao 1134.

12. ARRAGON.
ARRAGON is limited Eastward with Catelogue, Westward with Castile, Northward
with Navarre, Southward with Valentia: the Iberus runs just through the
middle of the Country.

The ancient In^^la were the Iaccetani, Lucenses, Celtiberi, etc. These last
were a mixed people, descended both from the Iberi, and the Celtae; of all
Gallia the most potent Nation: who being too populous for their Country, passed
over the Pyrenaei, and seated themselves here, whence this Nation was called
Celtiberi, the Country Celtiberia. Lucan.
-- profugique a gente vetusta
Gallorum, Celtaemiscentes nomen Iberi.
Who being chased from Gaul their home, did frame
Of Celtae and Iberi mixed, one name.
The present name is taken from Tarragon, a city which once gave denomination
to the greatest part of Spain, and is situate on the borders of this Country,
where it is confined with Catelogne. This town was built, fortified and peopled
by the two Scipioes, the Father and Uncle of Africanus; to oppose and bridle
Cartagena, not long before built by the Carthaginians.

The chief cities of Arragon are 1 Lerida an University situate on the river
Cinga, which rising in the Pyrenaean hills, and dividing Catelogne from Arragon,
emptieth it self into the Iberus. It was called of old Ilerda, and is famous
for the encounter which happened nigh unto it, Stadius in Florum.
between Herculeius the Questor or Treasurer of Sertorius army; and Manilius
Proconsul of Gallia; wherein Manilius was so discomfited, and his army
cons^sting of 3 Legions of foot, and 15 co horse, was so routed; that he almost
alone was scarce able to recover this City, few of his soldiers surviving the
overthrow. 2 Moson famous for entertaining the King of Spain every third
year; At which time the people of Arragon, Maginus.
Valence, and Catelogne, present the king with 600000 Crowns: viz. 300000 for
Catelogne, 200000 for Arragon, and 100000 for Valentia. And well may they thus
do, for at other times they sit rent-free as it were: only they acknowledge
the king of Spain to be the head of their Commonwealth. This revenue is
proportionably 200000 Ctownes a year, all which if not more, the king again
expends, in maintaining his Viceroyes in these several Provinces. 3 Iaca
situate on the very Northern edge of all the Country. Plutarch.
4 Huesca (called of old Osca) somewhat South of Iaca, an University, a place
long since dedicated to learning. For hither Sertorius caused all the Noblemens
sons of Spain to be brought, and provided them of Schoolemasters for the
Greek and Latin tongues: bearing their Parents in hand, that he did it only
to make them fit to undergo charge in the Commonwealth: but indeed to have
them as hostages for their Fathers faith and loyalty toward him. 5 Tordesillo
or Torizilla, and 6 Saragossa on the river Iberus or Ebro, an other University.
It was anciently named Caesarea Augusta: Caesar Augustus being the Founder of
it, and under the Moors was a peculiar kingdom. Archb. Turpine.
One of the kings was Aigoland, who long time made Charlemaigne believe he
would be baptized; and the time now at hand in which he should fulfill his
promise, he very gallantly accompanied, came to the French Court: where seeing
many Lazars and poor people expecting alms from the Emperors table, he
asking what they were, was answered, that they were the Messengers and servants
of God: ou these words he speedily returned, desperately protesting that he
would not serve that God, which could keep his servants no better. This town
was recovered from the Moors by Alphonso of Navarre 1118. 7 Bilbilis (now
Calataiub) the birthplace of Martial Hist. of Sp.


About the first erecting of the kingdom of Ovicdo and Sobabre, one Agnar
obtained lands in Arragon, with the title of Earl, Ao 775. which he left to
his son Galindo, from whom the sixth Earl was Don Fortun: His daughter Vrraca,
marrying to Garcia Inigo of Navarre, Ao 867, conveyed this Earldom to that
kingdom; of which it continued a member, till that Sancho the Great made it a
kingdom, and gave it to his natural son Raymir, 1034.

Hitherto of Spain, distracted into many royalties, now one word of the Union
of it in one body, and so an end.

THE MONARCHY OF SPAIN.
Before the reign of the last Ferdinand of Arragon, Spain being divided
amongst many Potentates, was little famous, less regarded: the kings, as the
Author of the politic dispute, etc. well notes, being only kings of Figs
and Orenges. Their whole puissance was turned one against the other, and final
atchieuements had they out of the Continent, unless those of the house of
Arragon in Sicile, Sardinia, and the Baleares. Thuanus a diligent writer of the
History of his own times (if in some respects he savor not more of the party
then the Historian) tells us, that till this kings reign, the name and glory
of the Spaniard's was like their Country; confined and hemmed in by the Seas on
one part, and the mountains on the other; potiusque patuisse exteris
invade^tibus, qua^ quicqua^ memorabile extra suos fines gessisse

But this Prince, worthily named the Great, seized on the Kingdom of Navarre,
ruined the kingdom of the Moors in Granaeda, began by the conduct of Columbus
the discovery of the Western Indies, banished 124. families of the Jews,
surprised the kingdom of Naples, united Castile to Arragon, and lastly by
marrying his daughter Ioane to Philip, son to Maximilian the Emperor, Duke
of Burgundy, and Lord of Belgia, laid the foundation of the present Austrian
greatness. Sands in the d^sc. of relig.

that king Philip if he were alive, might have called the Archduke Albertus,
Brother, Cousin, Nephew, and son; A strange medley of relations. Thus by the

obscurum antea and vicinis pene incognitum, tum primum emersit; tractuque
temporis in tantam magnitudinem excrevit, ut formidolosum ex eo and terribile,
toti terrarum orbi esse coeperit. Indeed to his Countrymen the French, the name
and puissance of the Spaniard has ministered no small matter of fear and
terror; yet are there some others, who being weighed in the scales of war with
them, would find them to be but light coin, at least if they knew their own
weight. Yet without doubt this Realm is even to wonder strengthened and
enlarged; strongly united and compacted with all the ligaments of power and
state in it self; and infinitely extended over the most principal parts of not
Europe only, but of the World also: his dominions beholding, as it were, both
rising and setting of the Sun in his East and Western Indies, which before
the Spaniard, no Monarch could ever say. A great change, which 140 years
since, no man would have believed to have bin possible to be effected.

Concerning the title of the most Catholic King, reattributed to this
Ferdinand; Hist. of Sp.
I find that Alphonso the first, of Oviedo, was so named for his sanctity: with
him this title died, and was reviued in Alphonso the great, the twelfth king of
Leon and Oviedo, by the grant of Pope John the 8. After it lay dead till the
d^yes of this Prince, who reobtained this title from Pope Alexander the sixth:
either because he compelled the Moors to be baptized, banished the Jews, and
in part converted the Ameri^ans unto Christianity: or because, having united
Castilo to his Dominions, surprised the kingdom of Navarre, and subdued that
of Granada, he was in a manner the Catholic or general King of all Spain*
The last reason seems to sway most in the restoration of this attribute; in
that when it was granted or confirmed on Ferdinando by Pope Alexander the sixth;
the King of Portugal exceedingly stomached it, quando Ferdinandus imperio
vniversam Hispaniam (says Maria^) non obtinere^; eius tum nou exigu^ part
penes reges alios. This title on what consideration soever regranted, is
assumed by his posterity; it being to them as the most Christian to France, and
the Defender of the Faith to England.

The ordinary reuennue of this Monarch, his Crown, and its appendices, Boterns.
are eleven Millions of crowns; Viz; Four from her Dominions in Italy, two
from Portugal and her territories, three from the Western Indies, and the
other two remaining from his other kingdoms of Spain and the lesser Islands.
His extraordinary revenues are uery great, as being Master of the Orders of S.
Iogo, Hist. of Sp.
Calatraua, and Alcantara, incorporate to the Crown by Ferdinand the
Catholic, and that on good policy: for the Masters of these several Orders
drew after them such a troop of the Nobility, that their power began to be
suspected to the Kings. On this and other cousiderations the Author of the
general History of Spain reckons his revenues according to diverse
opinions, to 14, 18, and 23, Millions of Crowns. To make up the sum, he
adds the first fruits, and some part of the Tithes, amounting unto three
millions; and the Author of the Politic dispute about the happiest, etc.
affirms the pardons sent into the Indies, which are given him by the Pope, to
be worth half a million of Crowns yearly. Add hereunto the fall and
disposal of all offices, Maginus.
which make up a round sum, and the free gifts and contributions of his
subjects which amount to a good revenew. For the kingdom of Naples gives him
every third year a million and 20000 crowns; and (to omit others) Castile did
of late grant him a contributio^ of four millions to be paid in 4 years. Yet
is not this Prince very rich, his expenses being very great, first in keeping
Garrisons in the heart of all his Countries, against the revolt of the natives:
secondly in maintaining the fortresses on the frontires, against foreign
invasions: thirdly in continual pay of an Armada, for the conducting of his
gold from America: and fourthly the unprofitable wars of Philip the second
have plunged the Crown so in the gulfes of Bankers and money men, that much of
the Kings lands is engaged for their repaiment.

The Monarchs of Spain. Hist. of Sp.

1475 1 Ferdinand K. of Arrag. Scilie, Sardmia, Maiorca, Valencia, Earl of
Catelogue; surprised Navar. 1475 1 Isabel Q. of Castile, Leon, Gallicia,

Castile, Granada, Leon, etc. and of Arragon, Navarre, Scicily, etc. 1504 2

Aeragon, Naples, etc Archduke of Austria, Duke of Millaine, Burgundy, Brabant,
etc. Earl of Catelogne, Flanders, Holland, etc. Lord of Biscay, Freizland,
Vtrect, etc. and Emperor of the Germans. A m^n of that magnanimity and
puissance, that had not Francis the first, in time opposed him, he had even
swallowed all Europe. He was of great strength and reputation in Tunis, and
other pa^ts of Africa, disposing Kings at his pleasur^; but the Turk^ broke his
power there, and being hunted also out of Germany, he resigned all his
kingdoms and died private. 52. 1558 4 Philip the II, of more ambition, but
less prosperity then his father: for whilst he catched after the shadow, he
lost the substance. The Hollanders, and their confederates drove him out of
eight of his Belgiqus Provinces; The English overthrew his Armada, and awing
the Ocean almost impouerished him; only he held for a time, a hard hand over
France; but casting up his accounts, found that himself was the looser: and
were it not that the invasion and detension of Portugal (just or unjust let
the world judge) had been a stay unto him, he had v^done himself and his
issue for ever. 40. 1598 5 Philip the III, (his elder brother Charles permitted
to be put to death by his father in the Inquisition house, for seeming to
favor the miserable estate of the Lowcountrey-men) succeeded. 22. 1621 6
Philip the IV, of the age of 18 years, is now living.
This Empire consisting of so many several kingdoms, united into one body,
may seem to be invincible. Yet had our late Queen followed the counsel of her
men of war, she might have broken it in pieces. With 4000 men, she might
have taken away his Indies from him, without whose gold the Low Country Army,
which is his very best, could not be paid, and so must needs be dissolved.
Nay, Sr Walter Raleigh in the Epilogue of his excellent history of the world,
plainly affirms, that with the charge of 200000l, continued but for two
years or three at the most; the Spaniards might not only have been persuaded
to live in peace: but all their swelling and ouerflowing streams might be
brought back to their natural chanells and old banks. Their own proverb
says, the Lion is not so fierce as he is painted: yet the Americans tremble at
his name, it is true: and it is well observed by a great politician, that things
which seem to be and are not, Machiauil.
are more feared far ^ff, th^n m^re at hand.

THE PYRENEAN HILLS.
Betwixt Spain and France, Hist. of Sp.
are the Mountains called Pyrenaei; and that either because they are often
stricken by thunder; or because they were once fired by certain shepherds, 880
years before Christ, at which time the Mines of gold and silver ran
streaming down for so many days, that the fame hereof incited forreiners to
make an entry into this country: Or lastly of Pyrene a Nymph, the daughter of
one Bebrix, supposed by some fabulous writers to have been here ravished by
Hercules. These hills not only stand as a natural bound, between the two great
and puissant Monarchs of France and Spain; terminating as it were, the desires
and attempts of one against the other, as well as their dominions: but are also
that neck of land or Istmus which tieth Spain to the Continent, the
Cantabrian Ocean fiercely beating on the West, and the Mediterranea^ gently
washing the East ends of them. Brerewood.
The highest part of this continued ridge of hill, is mount Canus, whereon if
one stands, he may in a clear day see both the Seas. It took the name of
Canus from the whiteness or hoarinesse thereof, as having on its top for the
most part a cap of snow: in which respect the Alps took their name, that in
the Sabine dialect being termed Alpum, which in the Roman was called Album:
and so also did mount Lebanon, Leban in the ancient Phoenician language,
signifying white, Plutarch.
and Lebanah whiteness. The barbarous people inhabiting these mountains,
compelled Sertorius in his passage into Spain, to pay them tribute or
custome-money for his passage through them: at which, when the Soldiers
murmured, as a thing dishonorable for a Roman Proconsull; he replied that he
bought only time; a commodity which such as aspire to haughty enterprises must
take up at any rates.

Hist. of. Fr.
The French side of these hills is naked and barren, the Spanish very fertile,
and adorned with trees. On this side stands R^n^evalles so famous for the
battle betwixt the Frenchmen and the Moors; in which 20000 of the French were
put to route; together with Rowland, cosen to Charles the great, Oliver, and
other Peer of France, of whom so many fabulous stories are related in old
histories. The first that broke the ice was Turpine Archbishop of Rheimes, and
one of the 12 Peers of France, who taking upon him to write the acts of
Charles the great, has interlaced his story with a number of ridiculous lies:
so that the valor of Rowland, Oliver, and the rest, is much blemished and
obscured by those relations, which purposely were feigned to manifest and
increase it.

OF FRANCE.
Maginus.
FRANCE is bounded on the North with Mare Britannicum, on the West with the
Aquitaine Sea, on the South with the Mediterranean, on the Southeast with the
Alps: and on the East, with the River Rheine, and an imaginary line, drawn
from Strasbourg to Callice.

It was first called Gallia from (...), milk, because of the inhabitants white
color: and afterward France of the Francones a people of Germany, which in
the decay of the Roman Empire here seated themselves.

The figure of it is almost square each side of the quadrature being in length
600 miles; it is sited in the Northern temporat Zone, between the sixth, and
eight Cl^mates, the longest day being 16 hours.

B^terus.
The Country is wondrous populous, supposed to contain 15 Millions of living
souls, for the most part being of an ingenious nature, curious, luxurious, and
inconstant. As now so in Caesar's time they were noted for overmuch
precipitation in all affairs, both Martial and Civil, entering an action like
thunder and ending it like smoke; Primus impetus mayor quam virorum, secundus
minor quans faeminarum, was their Character in the time of the historian
Florus. Hear if you will, a comparison (homely I confess but) to the life,
and beyond all parallel expressing the nature of the Dutch, French, and
Spanish, in matters of war. The French is said to be like a Fl^a, quickly
skipping into a country, and as soon leaping out of it. Such was the
expedition of Charles the 8th into Italy. The Dutch is said to be like a
Louse; slowly mastering a place, and as slowly (yet at last) being driven from
their hold. Such was their taking and loosing of Ostend and Gulicke. The
Spaniard is said to be like a Crabbe, or pediculus inguinalis, which being
crept into a place, almost at unawares, is there so fast rooted; that nothing
but the ex^remity of violence is able to fetch him out again. I think I need
not instance, it being generally observed that the Spaniard never mastered any
place, that ever he surrendered on composition. Moreover this French nation is
endued chiefly with Phrygian wisdom; View of Fr.
whence it is said, that the Italian is wise before hand, the Germane in the
action, the French after it is done. They are very litigious, insomuch as it is
thought, that there are more controversies tried there, between subject and
subject in 7 years: then have been in England since the Conquest. They are
great scoffers, yea even in matters of Religion, as appears by the story of a
Gentleman lying on his death-bead: who when the Priest had persuaded him, that
the Sacrament of the Altar was the very body and blood of Christ; refused to
receive it because it was Friday. Nor will I forget another of that quality,
and in the same extremity; who seeing the host (so they call the Lords body
consecrated) brought unto him by a lubberly Priest: said that Christ came unto
him, as he entered into Jerusalem, riding upon an Ass. The women are witty but
apish, wanton and incontinent, where a man at his first entrance may have
arquaintance, and at his smallest acquaintance may enter: willing to be courted
at all times, and places. Thus Dallington in his view of France, describes
them: but I have since heard this censure condemned, and the French G^ntlewomen
highly magnified for all virtues and gracee, which innoble and adorn that
sex. Between these so different opinions, I will not determine; but leave my
Reader to moderate the disputation (as I my self do) by his own charity.

View of Fr.
The chief exercises are. 1 Tennis, every Village having a Tennis-Court,
Orleans 60, Paris many hundreds. 2 Dancing, a sport to which they are so
generally affected, that were it not so much inueighed against by their
straight-laced Ministers, it is thought many more of the Catholics had been
reformed.

The language of the Spaniards is said to be manly, the Italians Courtly, and
the French amorous. A smooth language truly it is, the people leaving out in
their pronunciation many of their Consonants, and there withal giving occasion
of this Proverb, The Frenchman writes not as he pronounces, speaks not what
he thinks, nor sings as he pricketh: it is a compound of the old Gallique,
Br^rewood,
Germane, and Latin tongues. The old Gallique tongue was questionles the Welsh
or British, which most clearly appears by two reasons. 1 The Latin words
are known to have been received from the Romans, and the Germano at the
coming in of the Franks and Burgundians: but of the Welsh words no reason can
be given, but that they are the remnants of the old language. 2ly, Tacitus
tells us among other notes of comparison between the Gauls and the
Britains, whereby he firmly proves the latter to be the offspring of the
former: that Vtriusque sermo hand multum diuersus. And of these British words
continuing in the French language, Mr Camden has in his Brita^nia reckon^d a
great many.

View of Fr.
The soil is extraordinarily fruitful, having three loadstones to draw riches
out of other countries; Corn, Wines, and Salt: in exchange of which is yearly
brought into France ^ 200000l sterling; the custom of Salt only being worth
to the King 70000 Crowns yearly. It cannot but be well stoared with Fish,
for beside the benefit of the Seas; the Lakes and Ponds belonging only to the
Clergy, are 135000. The other Merchandise of this flourishing kingdom, are
Beefes, Hogs, Nuts, Almonds, Coroll, Oade, Linen, Canuis, and Skins.

This country could never boast of any famous Captain but of Charles the Great,
the founder of the Western Empire, and one of the three Christian Worthies;
and of late glories in the valor of Henry the fourth. For learning it has
bin somewhat more luckie, as producing Ausonius, P Ramus, S Bernard, Calvin
Beza, and that worthy Poet the darling of the Muses Salust^us du Bartas.

The Christian Religion was first planted here among the Gauls, Munster.
by Martialis whom St Peter sent hither: but among the French, by St Remigius,
in the time of Clovis the Great. The people are now divided, some following the
Romish synagogue, others the Reformed Church. These latter are called Hugonots,
so named, View of Fr.
as they say, of a gate in Tours (where they first began) called Hugo's gate,
out of which they used to go to their private assemblies. There were reckoned
some 53 years since, about 2150 Churches of them: which cannot in such a long
time but be wonderfully augmented, though scarce any of the^ have escaped some
Massacre, Hist. of Fr.
or other. Of these Massacres, two are most memorable, viz; that of Merindoll
and Chabriers, as being the first; and the Massacre at Paris, as being the
greatest. That of Merindoll happened in the year 1545, the ^nstrument of it
being Minier the President of the Council of Aixe. For having condemned this
poor people of heresy, he mustred a small Army and set fire on the Villages.
They of Merindoll, seeing the slame, with their wives and children fled into
the woods, but were there butchered, or sent to the galleys. One boy they took,
placed him against a tree, and shot him with Caliuers: 25 which had hid
themselves in a Cave, were in part stifled, in part burned. In Cabriers they so
inhumanely dealt with the young wives and maids, that most of them died
immediately after: The men and women they put to the sword; the children they
rebaptized: 800 men were murdered in a Cave, and 40 women put together in an
old Barn and burned. Yea such was the cruelty of the Soldiers to these poor
women, that when some of them has clambred to the top of the house, with an
intent to leap down, the Soldiers beat them back again with their pikes.
The Massacre of Paris was more cunningly plotted. A peace was made with the
Protestants, for the assurance whereof a marriage was solemnized between Henry
of Navar, chief of the Protestants party; and the Lady Margaret the Kings
sister. At this wedding there assembled the Prince of Conde, the Admiral
Colligni. and diverse others of great note. But at this solemnity there was not
so much wine drank, as blood shed. At midnight the watch-bell rang, the King
of Navarre, and the Prince of Conde were taken prisoners; the Admiral most
villanously slain in his bed; and to the number of thirty thousand and upward,
of the best, and most potent of the Religion, sent through this red sea, to the
land of Canaan. Anno 1572.

The revenues have much altered. Lewis the 11th gathered one Million and a
half of Crowns; View of Fr.
Francis the first brought them to three Millions; his successor Henry the
second to six; Charles they 9th to seven; Henry the third to ten; and now they
are inhanced to fifteen. But what need more be said then that of Lewis the
11th, who said that France was a Meddowe which he mowed every year, and as
often as he list: and indeed their impositions cannot but be great, since
there are no less then 30000 under officers employed to gather them. Hence I
believe sprung that wish of Maxim^llian the Emperor, which was, that he, (if
it were possible) might be a God: and that having two sons, the eldest might
be a God after him; and the second K. of France. And this also was the cause
that in the wars between Charles the fifth, and Francis the first, when the
Emperors Herald had bid defiance to the King; from Charles ^mperour of
Germany, King of Castile, Leon, Arragon, and Naples; Archduke of Austria, with
the rest of his titles: The king commanded the Heralds to return the challenge
from Francis King of France; commanding them to repeat France as many times, as
the other had petty Earledomes in his style.

Sleidan.
There are at this time in this kingdom 27400 parishes; which though many,
Comment.
fall much short of the reckoning made in the days of Lewis the 11th, when
here were esteemed to be no less then 100000 of them. Whether the many civil
wars have demolished the greater part, or that Chappells of ease, Oratories
and Monastical Churches went to make up the number, I wot not.

View of Fr.
The laws of this Kingdom are either temporal: or fundamental, which no King
or Parliament can alter. Of the latter of these the chief are two, the
Salique, and the law of Apennages. This of Apenuages is a law whereby the
younger Sons of the King cannot have partage with the elder. This law was
made by Charlemagne, before whose time France was diuidable into as many
Kingdoms, as the King had sons. By this law the younger (though sometimes
they are content with ye^rely pensions) are to be entitled to some Duchy,
and all the profits and rights thereto appertaining, all matters of regalitie
only excepted; as coynage, leuying taxes, and the like. It is derived from the
German word Abannage, which signifies a portion. The Salique law, is a law
whereby the Crown of France cannot fall from the Lance to the Dist^ffe (as
their saying is) which law one undertaking to prove out of holy writ, urged
that place of Matthew, where it is said, Mark the Lillies (which are the arms
of France) and see how they neither labor nor spin. This law they pretend to
have been made by Pharamond their fast King, and that the words, Si Aliqua, so
often mentioned, gave it the name of the Salique law: Hailan, one of their best
writers, says it was never heard of in France till the days of Philip the
fair 1321. Others say it was framed by Charles the great after his conquests
in Germany, where the incontinent lives of the women living about the river
Sala (in the Country now called Misnia) gave both the occasion and name to this
law, the words are these, Seldom.
De terra vero Salica nulla portio haereditatis mulieri veniat, sed ad virilem
sexum tota terra haereditas perueniat. This Terra Salica, Mr Seldom in his
titles of honor, Englisheth Knights fee, or land holden by Knights service. He
proves his interp^e^atio^ by a court ^oll of the Parliament of Bordeaux; where
there being produced an old testament, by which the testator had bequeathed to
his son his Salique land, it was by the Court resolved that thereby was meant
his land holden in Knights fee. This interpretation admitted, the sense of the
law must be, that in lands holden of the King by Knights fee, or the like
military tenure, only the males should inherit, because the women could not
perform those services by which the lands were holden. In England we deal not
with women so unkindly, but permit them to enjoy such lands after their age of
15 years, because then they may take such husbands as are able to do the King
the duties and services required. But this interpretation, how good and genuin
soever indeed it be, cannot stand with the French Gloss: For then the Crown
being holden of none but God only, and so not properly called a fee or feife,
were incapable of that privilege of exclud^ng women from the Salique land.
Give them therefore their own Gloss, their own Etymology, and original;
and let us see, by what right their Kings daughters are debarred from the
Diadem. For if that were the S^lique land where now is Misnia, how can this law
bar Females from the Diadem of France so far distant from it? Moreover, is
it not against the law of Nations, and (which is more) contrary to the direct
word of the most high? For we read in Numbers cap. 27. that the daughters of
Zelopedah were adjudged to possess the inheritance of their father. All
Kingdoms else admit women to the Regency; yea even France it self most
seruilely has submitted it self twice, to the imperious command of two women
of the Medices. But suppose this law to be made by Pharamond, to concern
France, to be consonant with the laws of other nations, and the word of God;
does it therefore appertain to all France? Nothing less. Pharamond had then
not so much as the Il^ of France, wherein Paris is seated: and it had been an
absurd and mad thing in him, to give the law to Princes more potent then
himself, and to whose territories he had neither right nor hope.

Again, we see the French for their own particular good, not a whit to have
regarded it, King Pipin having put his Master Childericke into a Monastery, to
patch up his broken title to the Crown, drew his pedigree from some of the
daughters, of the issue of the former Princes. As also Hugh Capet putting aside
Charles of Lorraine, the right heir of the stock of this Pepin; to make his
bad attempts more seemingly honest, drew his title by the Daughters of the
issue of Charles the great. And Lewis the ninth, so renowned for his sanctity,
never inioyed the crown with a quiet conscience, till it was proved unto him,
that by the Grandmothers side, he was descended from the heirs of the
forementioned Charles of Lorraine. Thus has it been with them for France it
self. Have they dealt thus with other Provinces? Certainly thus and no
otherwise. Charles the 8 ^ se^sed on the Duchy of Britain, and his
successors since have kept it by the right of Anne his wife, the daughter unto
Francis the last Duke. I ask then this question; did this law extend to one
only part of France (namely the Isle wherein Pharamonds posterity first
reigned) or to every part? If to all jointly; with what right could Charles the
8th possess himself of Britain, in right of his wife, who no question was a
woman: when there were some of the male line of that Ducall family surviuing?
If it belong to that part only; with what color can they dawbe their forcible
withholding of it from the true heir of Anne the Duchess; whose daughter and
heir Claude, had issue by Francis the 1 her husband, Henry the second, her
son and heir: whose eldest Daughter and Heir (after the death of her four
brothers, Francis the second, Charles the 9th, Henry the 3d, and Francis Duke
of Aniou, all dying without issue) was Elizabeth, married to Philip the 2d of
Spain. So that it is evident by who^soeuer this law was enacted, and howsoever
it did extend; it is of no such force, but that the Labels of it may easily be
cut in pieces, by an English sword well whetted.

Some account this Salique law to be a great happiness to the French nation, not
so much in relation to the unfitness of women to govern (for therein some of
them have gone beyond most men) but because thereby the Crown o^ France is not
endangered, to fall into the hands of strangers. These men consider not how
great Dominions may by this means be incorporate to the Crown. They remember
not how Maude the Empress being married to Ge^frie Earl of Aniou, Touraine,
and Meine, conveied those countries to the Diadem of England; nor what rich and
fertile Provinces were added to Spain, by the match of the Lady Ioane to
Archduke Philip. Neither do they see that ineffable blessing which England
now eni^yeth by the conjunction of Scotland proceeding from a like marriage. Yet
there is a saying in Spain, that as a man should desire to live in Italy
because of the ciuility and ingenious natures of the people; and to dye in
Spain because there the Catholic Religion is so sincerely professed: so he
should wish to be borne in France, because of the nobleness of that nation,
which never had any King but of their own country.

The chiefest enemies to the French have been the English, and Spaniards; the
former had here great possessions, diverse times plagued them, and took from
them their kingdom, but being called home by civil dissentions, lost all. At
their departure the French scoffingly asked an English Captain, when they
would return? Camden.
Who feelingly answered, when your sins are greater then ours. The Spaniards
began but of late with them, yet have they taken from them Navarre, Naples, and
Millaine; they displanted them in Florida, poisoned the Dolphin of Vienneys,
drove their King Henry the 3d out of Paris and most of his other Cities, all
which they possessed: at last they caused him to be murdered, and intended the
like to his successors; a Series of injuries more memorable then marriageable.
Concerning the last wars which the Spaniard made in France, when he sided
with the Duke du Maine, and the rest of those Rebels, which called themselves
the Holy League, whereof the Duke of Guise was the Author; against the two
Kings Henry the 3d and 4th: a French Gentleman made this excellent allusion.
For being asked the causes of these civil broils, he replied they were ^pania
and Mania: seeming by this answer to signify (...) penury, and (...) fury,
which are indeed the causes of al intestine tumults; but covertly therein
implying the King of Spain and the Duke of Maine. C^mines.
In former times there were no nations more friendly then these, the Kings of
Castile and France being the nearest confederated Princes in Christendom. For
their league was between King and King, Realm and Realm, Subject and
Subject; which they were all bound under great curses to keep inviolable.

V^iw of Fr.
This Country is wonderfully stored with rivers, the chiefest whereof is 1
Seine, which arising in Burgundy, watring the cities of Paris and Roane; and
receiving into it nine nauigable streams, disburdeneth it self into the
British Ocean. 2 Some, upon which stands Amiens; it has its head about S
Quintins, divides Picardie from A^toys, and having received eight lesser
streams loses it self in the Sea. 3 Loyre; on which are seated Nantes and
Orleance; it rises about the mountains of Avergue (being the greatest in
France:) and having run 600 miles, and augmented his Channel with the
entertainment of 72 lesser rivulets, mingleth his sweet waters with the
brackish Aquitane Ocean. 4 Rhoane, which springing at Driga, three miles from
the head of Rhene, watreth Lions (where it receaueth Sone hastening from
Alsatia) then Avignion, and lastly taking in 13 lesser brooks, steals into
the Mediterranean Sea at Arles. And 5 Garond, which running from the Pyrenean
hills to Blay, standing on the Aquitaine Ocean; glideth by the walls of
Bordeaux, and Toulouse, and receaueth 16 lesser rivers. Of these the Seine is
the richest, the Rhoane the swiftest, the Garond the greatest, and the Loyre
the sweetest.

This fruitful Region (if we may, as I think not, give credence to report)
was first peopled by Samothes, the sixth son of Iophet, called in the
Scriptures Mesech, in the year of the world 1806. The offspring attributed to
him were certainly a warlike nation, without whose love no king could secure
himself from imminent dangers. They were very sparing in their diet, and used
to fine any one that outgrewe his girdle. With these men the Romans fought,
rather for their own preservation, then in any hope by a conquest of them to
enlarge their Dominions. Yet at last they undertook the war, but not till
they had subjected almost all the residue of the world. And the^ also no^ so
much by the valor of the Romans (though the war was managed by the most able
Captain that ever Rome gave breath to:) as by their own divisions, Plutarch.
were they brought under. These men had formerly under the conduct of Bremus,
said to be the brother of Be^inus King of England, discom^ited the Romans at
the river Allia; sacked the City, and beseiged the Capitol, Anno M. 3577;
V.C. 365. In this cause they so terrified the Romans, that after their
expulsion from Rome by Camillus, there was a law made; that the Priests, though
at al other times exempted, should be compelled to the war, if ever the
Gauls came again. From Rome they marched on to Greece, where they spoiled and
ransackt the Temple of Delphos, for which sacrilege, they were visited with the
pestilence. Such as suruiued this plague, went into Asia, and there gave name
to that country, now called Galatia. B^rt^s.

This country after 40 years resistance by the valor and good fortune of
Caesar became tributary to the Romans; and so remained till their apparent
declining, Hist. of Fr.
when the Francones, the Burgundians, and Goths wrested the most of it from
the Roman Monarchy. Between these three mighty nations was France divided in
this manner. The Goths possessed all the country between the Rhoane, East;
the Aquitaine Ocean, West; the Loyre, North; and the Pyrenean hills, South. The
Burgundians had all which lies between the Alpos and the Rhene, East; the
Rhoane West; Lorreine, North; and the Mediterranean, South. All the rest
together with Belgia belonged to Franks, whose King Charlemaine utterly ruined
the kingdom of the Goths: and his successors by little and little have
brought to almost nothing, that of the Burgundians. By the Romans this country
was divided into three parts, viz: Belgicam, environed with the Rhene, the
Marne, the Seine, and the Ocean: 3ly, Aquitanicam, which reached from the
Pyrenean hills to the Garound; and contained also all the sea coasts up to the
Loyre: 3ly, Celticam, which comprehended all the rest; and was subdivided into
Lugdunensem, containing Daulphine, Savoy, and both Burgundies; and Nar^onensem,
comprehending Languedocke, and Provence. To Celtica, properly and more strictly
so called, appertained Berry, Burbon, Anion, Britain. After the coming of
these new conquerours, it was divided into many Provinces, whereof the chief
are. 1 Gascoyne, and Guyen. 2 Poicton. 3 Anion. 4 Britain. 5 Normandy. 6
France. 7 Berry. 8 Limosin. 9 Languedocke. 10 Provence. 11 Picardie, and
Campaigne. 12 Daulphine. 13 The Duchy. 14 The Earldom of Burgundy. 15 Savoy.
16 Lorrain. Of some of these La No^e passes this censure. The men of Berry are
Leachers: they of Touraine or Aniou Thieves: They of Languedocke Traitors: They
of Provence are Atheists: They of Rh^mes (in Campaigne) superstitious: They of
Normandy insolent: They of Picardie proud: and so of the rest.

1. GASCOYNE and GVIEN.
GASCOYNE and GVIEN comprehend in a manner all Gallia Aquitanica bounded with
the Pyrenean hills, the Aquita^ne Ocean, and Garound. It took this name from
the Vascones, a people of Spain, who here seated themselves. Next to the
Pyrenean hills lies the Lordship of Berne, belonging to the kings of Navarre,
ever since it and the Earldom of Foix were united to that Crown Anno 1481.
It continued very faithful unto Henry of Burbon late King of France and
Navarre, Camden.
during his troubles after the death of Henry the 3d* insomuch that he was in
mockage called by his enemies the Biernoys. Of this Earldom the chief City
is Oleron. Nigh unto it lies the Earldom of Foix, two of whose Earls are of
great fame, viz: John de Foix, whom our Henry the sixth for his faithful
service in the French wars, created Earl of ^endale; which addition of
honor some of that family still retain: And Gaston de Foix so renowned in the
wars of Italy. These principalities were together joined by the marriage of
Marguerit, heir of Berne, unto Roger Bernard, Earl of Foix, 1262. and both
together connected to the Crown of Navarre by the matrimonial union of
Leonora Princess of Navarre, and Gastone of Foix. Here are also the Earledomes
of Arminacke, Cominges, Bigorre, and Albret. The chief Cities in this tract
generally are, 1 Toulouse supposed to be built when Deborah judged Israel: here
was a Parliamentary Court erected for the administration of Justice in these
parts, Ortelius.
1302. It was observed that certain Soldiers having stolen sacrilegiously
some Gold out of the Temples of Toulouse (when it was sacked by Cepio a Roman
Consul) came all to miserable and unfortunate ends; hence grew that Adage,

applied to unhappy men. The fields about this town are in old writers called
Campi Catalanniel, extending in length 100, and in breadth 70 French Leagues.
In these fields was fought that terrible battle between Attila King of the
Hunnes, and Aet us the Roman Leistenant in France. Aetius was strengthened by
the Goths, Franks, Burgundians, and Germans. Attilas army consisted of Hunnes,
Eruli, Scythes, Sarmatians, and Suevians, to the number of 500000; of which
180000 that day lost their lives; Attila himself being dr^uen to that
desperate plunge, that making a funeral pile of Horse saddles, he would have
burned himself. But his enemies weary of well doing gave him leave to retire
homeward through Italy, which he harassed with sire and sword, murdering the
people, and ruining the towns, so that he was then and long after called
Flagellum dei. Aetius notwithstanding this good service, was by Valentinian
Emperor of the West, rewarded with the loss of his head. By which act, the
Emperor (as one told him) had cut off his right hand with his left. And indeed
so it happened, for not long after he himself was by Maximianus murdered, and
the Empire of Rome irrecouerably destroyed. 2 Bordeaux where our king Richard

On the Northern end of this Country joins the little Province Xaintoigne,
the chief Towns are Saints ( olim, Mediolanum) and Rochel, the best
fortefied town of all France, and the best fortress of the Protestants.

It will not be amiss in this place, to say somewhat of the war^es which the
Citizens of this Town have diverse times maintained against the French King in
defense of Religion. At the end of the second civil wars, French hist.
Ao 1568 many towns considering how ill the former peace had bin observed,
refused to take in any of the kings garrisons, neither would they permit any of
the Papists to bear office among them. Of those, Rochel was one; which also
contrary to the kings command, maintained a navy for their safety by sea, and
continued their fortifications for their defense by land. So that hither the
Queen of Navarre and her son retired as to a place of security, 1570, Rochel of
all the French towns, only held good for the Protestants, and is by M. Iarvill
on all sides blocked up. But the siege is soon raised, and Rochel, Montalban,
Sancerre, with some other towns are made cautionarie for the peace ensuing.
1573. It was besieged by Byron the elder, with an army of 50000 men, and 60
pieces of artillery. Here were present at this siege King Charles, Henry D. of
Aniou his brother; the Duke of Aumal, etc. It held out from the beginning of
March, till the 17 of June, and was then freed: the city having in one month
endured 13000 shot; and the king in his whole war lost 20000 of his men, and
among others the Duke of Aumal. 75 and 76, it was attempted by M. Landereau,
and the I Will of Re nigh to it was taken, but soon recovered; after which the
king of Navarre, and the Prince of Conde entered it in triumph.1577. it is by M.
Lansac besieged Seaward, but he being beaten back, peace was made, and 8 other
pledge-townes assigned. It was in the troubles of 85 and 88, the place of
retreat to the aboue-named Princes; And when the Guisiards had compelled king
Henry to make war upon the Religion; The king of Navarre issued from thence
to divert the Duke M^r^uer from Montagne. The next year Henry 3 being slain,
the Rochelers sided with Henry 4, and till the year 1621. were never molested;
Within this little Province of Xaintoigne, is also the well-fortified town of S.
John de Angelo.

The Duchy of Aquitaine was given by Charles the Bald, Paradine.
unto Ranulph a Burgundian, for his good service against the Normans, Ao 844.
To whose second successor called Eudes, were added the Earledomes of P^ictou
and Avergne, anno 902. In this Image it continued till the year 1152. When
Elenor the daughter and heir to William the 5 of that name, was married to
Henry the 2d of England, from whose youngest son John, unjustly detaining the
Crown of England from Arthur of Britain, son to Geofrie his eldest brother; it
was taken by Philip of France, anno 1202; the said John being first lawfully
convicted by his Peers, for Felony, and the murder of his Cousin Arthur, and
by them condemned to forfeit his estates in France. After about the year 1259,
S. Lewis of France gave unto Henry the third of England, the Duchy of Guien,
conditionally that he should renounce all title to his other inheritances. This
Duchy containing the hithermost part of Gascoigne, and the country of Xainton
unto the river of Charent, continued English till the year 1452: When by
reason of the civil wars between York and Lancaster, the Garrison Soldiers
were recalled to maintain factions at home, and Charles the 7 of France
recovered Guien, and all the other English possessions, Calice excepted.

2. POICTOV.
POICTOV has on the North Britain and Anion, on the East the Duchy of
Berrie; on the South Xaintoigne, and Guien; on the West the Aquitaine Seas. It
is called in Latin, Pictavia, from the Pictones, being the ancient
inhabitants, and is a country so great and plentiful, that there are numbered
1200 Parishes, and three Bishoprics: The chief Cities are 1 Poicteirs, in
Latin Pictavis, Ortelius.

Martin.
In the Vine-field of this Country, was fought that memorable battle between
John of France and our Black Prince; who being distressed by the number of the
French, would willingly have departed on honorable terms, which the French
not accepting, instead of Conquest, found an overthrow. For they presuming on
their own worth, always to their own disadvantage, bereft the enemy of all
opportunity of retiring; whereas ordinary policy would instruct the leader of
an Army, to make his enemy if he would fly, a bridge of gold, as Count Pitelan
used to say: Hereupon Themistocles would not permit the Grecians to break the
bridge made over the Hellespont by Xerxes, left the Persians should be
compelled to fight, and so happen to recover their former losses: and Charles
the 6 lost his Army by intercepting of our 5 Henry in his march to Calice. For
where all way of fl^ght is stopped, the basest Soldier will rather dye with
glory in the front of his battle, then fly and be killed with ignominy. So
true a Mistress of hardy resolutions is despair, and no less true this
proverb of ours, Make a Coward fight and he will kill the Devil. On the
contrary it has bin the use of diverse politic Captains, to make their own
Soldiers fight more resolutely, taking from them all hope of safety but by
battle. So did our William the Conqueror; who at his arriual into England,
burnt the ships which transported his Army, thereby giving his Soldiers to
wit, that their lives lay in the strength of their arms, and courage of their
hearts; not in the nimblenesse of their heels. Tariff the leader of the Moors
into Spain, burnt likewise all his Navy, one only Pinnace excepted, which he
reserved to carry tidings of his success. When Charles Martell encountered that
infinite host of the Saracens, (of which you shall anon hear more) he
commanded the people of Toures to open their gates only to the Victors: then
he led his Army over the Loyre, placing on the banks thereof certain troops
of horsemen, to kill all such as fled out of the field: Hereby informing his
men, that there was to them no more France then what they fought on, unless
they were conquerours. In like manner the same Themistocles cunningly working
the Persians to enclose the Greek Navy on every side, enflamed the Grecians
with such courage by this necessity of fight, that they gave their enemies the
memorablest defeat, that ever happened on the seas.

This Country is watered with Clavius, Ortelius.
Vienne, and Crevise, three rivers which run into the Loyre: and has
followed the f^rtune of Aquitaine.

3. ANIOV.
ANIOV in Latin Andegavium, though but little, is excellent fruitful,

and yields the best wines in France. To it are annexed the Provinces of
Turraine and Maine; this last formerly inhabited by the Cenomani, the former is
divided by the Loyre. The chief Towns of Aniou are Angiers (of old Iulio
Magus) where Lewis the 2d Duke hereof, founded an University, Anno 1388. 2
Beaufort a town belonging to our Dukes of Lancaster, in which John of Gaunt so
much delighted, Gamdens Remains
that he caused all the children which he had by Catharine Swinforte his third
wife, to be called Beaufortes, a reason not known to all: which Beaufortes
were afterward Dukes of Somerset and Exeter, and Earls of Dorset. This town
come to the house of Lancaster by Blanch of Artoys, unto Edmund surnamed
Crouchbacke, second s^n to our Henry the 3d, created by his Father the first
Earl of Lancaster. Nigh unto this town Thomas D. of Clarence, and brother to
Henry 5 was slain, Anno 1422. 3 Saumur, a town pleasantly seated on the
Loyre; and lately one of the pledge-townes in the hands of the Protestants. On
the North side of Anion between it and Normandy, lies Maine, whose chief
towns are 1 Man's or Maine, the principal town in all this Country, seated on
the river of Magenu^; which arising in the Northern edge of this Province, and
washing the walls of this town and Angeirs, emptieth it self in the Loyre. 2
Beaumont. 3 Vendosme, standing on the Southeast corner of this Country: a town
which belonged to the house of Burbon; and gave name to Antonio, surnamed
Vendosm* Father to Henry the 4. On the Southeast of Aniou, between it and
Berrie, lies the Country of Toureine, whose mother city is Tours (or Turena)
where the Protestants first began, and from one of whose gates, called Hugoes
gate (as before we have said) they took the name of Hugonots. Some have
derived this name from the first words of an Apology which they made before
the French king, which were Huenos venimus; and as the Protestants were so
called, because in their writings to the Emperor, they often used the word
Protestumus; so from the word Huenos, the name of Hugonots, or Hu^nots must
needs be deduced. Not much unlike to this are the etymons of the Longebards and
Wallouns, of whom I shall hereafter have occasion to speak, which came
questionless out of the same forge. Near unto this town Charles Martell,
Father to Pepin King of France, discomfited an host of 400000 Saracens, led by
Abderamen, and slew of them 370000, about the year of our redemption 732. 2

the command of Henry the 3d.

Aniou was given to Robert a Saxon Prince, Paradin^.
by Charles the Bald, for his valor shown against the Normans 870. The third
in direct line from this Robert, was Hugh Capet King^ of France by general
election, who gave the Earldom of Aniou unto Geofry Grisogonelle a Saxon
Knight, Anno 926. The first of his Successors that possessed Maine, was Foulke
the third* 1083. by the right of Sybell his wife, daughter to Helie Earl of
Maine Their son Geofry was afterward enriched with the addition of the County
of Tourame; and his marriage with Maude daughter and h^ite to Henry the first
of England, and widow of Henry the 4, Emperor. From these two proceeded Henry
the 2d King of England* and Farle of Aniou; whose fourth son John lost all his
Estates in France by confiscation, 1202. Then it was given to Charles, son to
Lewis the eight; in right of his wife, Earl of Provence; and by the gift of
Pope Urban the fourth, King of Naples and Sicily, 1262. It was raised to a
Duchy by Charles the 5, Anno 1280. And lastly given by Rene tho last Duke, to
Lewis the eleventh, Anno 1480.

4. BRITAIN.
BRITAIN is environed with Maine, Camden.
Touraine, and the Sea. It is divided into Hault or high Britain, being the
Eastern, and Basse or Low Britain being the Western parts; and was first
called Armerica, quasi Ad mare sita; and now Britain, of the Britains,
which in the reign of Maximinus came hither and seated themselves; to whom
there flocked infinite others at the Saxons tyrannizing in Britain. These
people both conquered and new named the Country, according to these Verses:
Vicit Aremoricaes animosa Britannia gentes,
Et dedit imposito nomina prisca ingo.
The ancient Britain by the Saxons chaced
Du Bartas.
From's native Albion, soon the Gauls displaced
From Armorick; and then victoriously
After his name surnamed it Brittanny.


The British or Welsh language in part remains here still; for such as came
out of Britain hither first, Camden.
and married the women of this Country, did cut out their tongues, lest they
should corrupt the language of their children. Notable rivers here are none,
which defect is supplied by the neighborhood of the Sea, which yields them
diverse Havens, the chief being Ereiste and S. Malo, so often spoiled and
damaged by the English in our French wars, since the time of Henry 7. As for
their cities the chief of them are 1 Nantes, on the banks of the Loyre, where
the Parliament of Britain is kept, which was erected Ao 1553. 2 Rhones on the
little river Vilent. 3 Vannes seated on the South sea. 4 S. Breine, the seat
of the chief Bishop of this Province on the No^th sea; and 5 Rohan the title
and inheritance of that fauous Prince the Duke of Rohan, who in the late wars
adhered so closely to them of the Religion.

about the year 859, and so continued till the time of John the Red, Earl of
Britain; who by Lewis the 9 was made a Duke, Anno 1250. In his posterity it
continued till the days of Duke Francis the second, who joining himself in
league with Charles Duke of Berry, and Charles Duke of Burgundy, against Lewis
the 11^ drew ru^ne on his head, which he could not possibly avoid Charles Duke
of Berry, as it was thought, was poisoned, Charles of Burgundy lost his life at
the battle of Nancie, 1476; and his country was conquered by the French King:
Hist. Fr.
And Francis this Duke having embarked himself in the saiue troublous Ocean,
must needs suffer shipwrecke with his Copartners. The King of France inuadeth
Britain, The Duke ouercharged with melancholy, dies, 1488; leaving Anne his
daughter and heir, in the power of his enemy Charles the eight: who contracts
a marriage with the Orphan, and unites Britain to France. There were many
impediments which might have hindered this marriage, but Charles breaks
through them all. First Charles himself had bin formerly contracted to
Archduke Maximilians daughter; but this he held void, because the young Lady
was not of age at the time of the contract. 2ly Anne the Duchess was also
contracted to Maximilian; and this he held vnvalid, because the Duchess being
his homager, could not bestow her self without his license. and 3l^ Maximilian
had by proxy married her, which marriage he consummated by a ceremony in those
days new; For his Ambassador attended by a great train of Lords and Ladies,
bared his leg up to the knee, and put it into the Dutchesses sheets, thereby
taking possession of her bed and body: But Charles consulting with his Divines,
was told that this pretended consummation, was rather an invention of Court,
then any way firm by the Laws of the Church. Certainly God blessed not this
wedding; for of three children which they had between them, not one lived.
Charles being dead, his successor Lewis on the same policy, divorced himself
from his own wife, and married this Duchess. From this second marriage, the
Acrhdutchesse Isabell descended; for whom, when her Father King Philip made a
claim to this Duchy, Hist. of Sp.
she indeed being the true heir in lineal descentithe Frenchmen urged a Law of
their own devising, that no Country being once incorporate to the French
Crown, could again be aliened. A proper Law truly, but somewhat newer, and of
a worse stamp then the Salique.

Most of our ^or^ or Earls of Richmond, Camden.
were Earls and Dukes of this house. The arms are Ermines.

5. NORMANDY.
NORMANDY has on the South Maine, Orteli^^.
and the Isle of France; on the East the River Some, on other parts the Ocean.
It was formerly called Neustria, corruptly for Westria, the word Westenrich
signifying in the Germane tongue, the Western limit of the Empire: and now
Normandy of the Normans.

The river Sequana, or Seine, runs qulte through it, as also two lester
rivers Orus and Anon.

In this Country is the little Signiory of Ividot, heretofore a kingdom free
and absolute. Clotaire the seventh King of France, having abused the wife of
Gawter d'Ividot, Hist. of Fr.
(so called because he was here borne) added one wickedness to another,
killing this Gawter as he was at his devotions on a Good Friday, therein
preventing the revenge which he knew he had deserved. After this wicked act,
his conscience accusing him, and the Roman Bishop exhorting to repentance, he
erected the Lordship of Ividot to a kingdom; assigning the posterity of Gawter
all the prerogatives of a free Monarch, as to make Laws, coin money, and the
like. From hence the French call a man that has but small demaines to
maintain a great title, a Roy d' Ividot. At last, but at what time I know not,
it fell again to a Lordship, and belongs now to the house of Bellay in Little
Britain.

This Dukedom of Normandy contains 8 cities, the chief whereof are 1
Constance, Camden.
2 Cane famous for the long resistance it made to Henry the fifth of England. 3
Bayeux on the Sea side, the Bishop whereof Odo, was the Earl of Kent; who
having displeased King William his brother, was committed to prison by a witty
distinction; not as the Bishop of Bayeux, (for then the Clergy was free from
all secular jurisdiction,) but as the Earl of Kent. 4 Pontoyse. 5 Roane the
Metropolis of Normandy. In the chief Church of this town is the Sepulcher of
John Duke of Bedford, Regent of France, whose monument when a foolish Court^er
persuaded Charles the eight to deface, God defend (says he) that I should
wrong him dead, whom l^uing all the force of France could not resist. 6 Palaise
a town once of good strength. P. Virgil.
As Duke Robert passed through this town, he beheld among a company of young
maids dancing, one Arlet a skinners daughter: whose nimblenesse in her dance,
made the Duke think she was not sluggish in a bed, and therefore he sent for
her to accompany him that night. To omit the immodest behavior she used at her
lying down; the Duke on her begat that night William the Bastard, King of
England: in spite to whom, and disgrace to his mother, the English called all
Whores Harlets, a word yet in use amongst us. 7 Mortaigne, which was the title
or Earldom which was given to John surnamed Sansterre, afterward king of
England; and 8 Crecie a town in the Country of Pentheiu, lying on the East of
Normandy; nigh unto which Edward the 3d overcame Philip of Valoys. 8. Caux. 9
Verneile. It is reported that when Philip the second of France, had besieged
this town, and that news of it came to Richard the first of England; that he
should protest in these words, I will never turn my back till I have
confronted the French: For the performance of which Princely word, he brake a
way through his Palace of Westminster, and came so unexpected to France, that
the French raised their siege, and departed.

The chief Hauen-townes are Hareflow, and Deep. Of these the former was the
first town which our victorious Prince king Henry the 5 attempted and took in,
in France. The latter is famous for its fidelity, and immovable allegiance to
Henry 4 of France, even in the midst of his troubles: at that time when the
confederat Papists of the Guisian faction, calling themselves the holy League,
had beaten him out of almost all his towns, and in dernion called him King of
Deep. The third Hauen-towne is Newhauen, Camdeni Elizab.
in Latin called Franciscopolis, because it was founded by Francis the first.
This town was in the first civil wars in France about religion, yielded into
the hands of Elizabeth of England by the Prince of Conde and his faction, as a
town of Caution, for such forces as she should on their behalf levy. The
French king not liking a neighbor so potent, made peace with the Protestants,
on that condition that they should drive home the English. By this means he
weakened their forces for the present; deprived them of all hope of future aid
from our Queen; twisted his own plots closer; and the next year began a
stronger war upon them, now ashamed anywhere to demand succor.

The Parliamentary City for this and the adjoining Provinces, is Rhoane (of old
R^thomagus) erected Ao 150^.

The Normans were a people of Norwegia, and made their first irruptions about
the year 700: when they so ransacked and plagued the Maritime towns, that it
was inserted into the Letany, From Plag^e, Pestilence, and the fury of the
Normans good Lord, etc. To quiet these people, and to secure himself, Charles
the Bald gave them a part of Neustria, by them since called Normannia: Their
first Duke was R^ll^, Ao 900, from whence in a direct line, the sixth was
William the Bastard, Conqueror, and King of England, Ao 1067. After this,
Normandy continued English till the days of King John; when Philip Augustus
seized on all his estates in France as forfeitures, Ao 1202. The English then
possessing the Dukedomes of Normandy, Guyen, and Aquitaine; the Earledomes of
Aniou, Touraine, Maine, Poicteirs, and Limosin; being in all a far greater
and better portion of the Country, then the Kings of France themselves
possessed.

9. THE ISLE OF FRANCE.
THE ISLE OF FRANCE is sited in the circlings and confluences of Seine, and
other petty brooks, as our Isle of Ely in Cambridgeshire on the confluence of
Welland and other Rivers. It took its denomination from the Francones, who did
first erect their kingdom in this place. These Francones were a people which
lived in the great Forest called Sylva Hercyma in Germany, Pezelius in Sleidan.
who driving the Vangiones out of their Country, there seated themselves, and
called it after their own name Franconia. These Julius Caesar tamed, Maximinus
slaughtred, Constantine vanquished, and Julian the Apostata kept under: yet
under the reign of Valentinian the first, they began to shake off the clog of
bondage, and diminishing their name with their increase of power, called them
France, or Franks, that is Freemen. They were governed by Dukes till the year
420, when Pharamond took on him the title of king. As for France, the first
that ever set foot there, was Moroucus, who seeing the Romans on one side put
to the worst by Theodoric and the Goths; entered together with the Burgundians
on the other, seized on the Isle of France, subdued Paris, and made it the seat
of his Kingdom. Afterward when they had fully seated themselves here, the
kings used to divide their kingdom according to the number of their sons: View
of Fr.
Hence have we a King of Orleance, a K. of Austrasia, a K. of Soyssons; a K. of
France, which always was he, and he only who had his seat in Paris. This is
the chief city of France, and was called formerly Lutetia, quasi Luto sita, as
being sited in so clayie asoyle that they use as a common Proverb to say, It
stains like the dirt of Paris. The University here is accounted the first of
Europe, Sleidan Comment.
containing 55 Colleges, built by Charles the Great at the persuasion of
Alcuine an Englishman, Ao 800. Francis the first, whom the French call the
father of the Muses, intended, (being persuaded thereunto by Reucline and
Budaus, as great restorers of letters in those parts, as Moore in England, or
E. rasinus in Germany) to have built here a College, wherein should have bin
Professors of all Arts and Languages. He would have endowed it with 50000
Crowns of yearly revenue, for the maintenance of his Professors and
Scholars, whose number in all should have bin 600. But it went no further then
the intent, for death took from him time to actuate it. This City is in
compass 12 miles, and is reported to have bin built in the time of Amasias
King of Judah. It stands in a most fertile soil, insomuch that when it was
besieged by the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Britain, with an army of 100000
men; neither the assailants without, nor the defendants within, felt any want
of victuals; and yet the Citizens besides the common soldiers, are reckoned to
be 4 or 500000. It is honored with a Parliament, to which all other may
appeal, from which not one. These French Parliaments are as our Law-Courts
are, our Parliaments as their Conventus ordinum. It is seated on Seine, which
serves the Town with little boats and barges (as the Thames Westward does
London) the river ebbing and flowing no farther then Pontclarch, distant from
Paris 75 miles, or thereabout. The Parisians brag that their town was never
conquered: the reason is, it is very weak^; and therefore compoundeth with the
enemy. This Town was held by the English 16 years, and solemnized the
Coronation of Henry the sixth of France and England, with all joyful
acclamations, in the Church of Nostre Dame: being long 65 faddome, broad 24,
high 15, above which the St^eples are elevated 34 faddome, Secondly also here
is S. Vincents, where victorious Henry the fifth ended his days. Thirdly
somewhat Eastward, Soysons, once the seat of the King of Soysons, for only the
kings of Paris (as we have said) were called Kings of France. Fourthly
Charenton, famous for the assiduous preaching here of that excellent ornament
of the French Church, Peter du Moulin. H^ere is also in this Isle the royal
Palace of Fountain bleau, (that is the fair Fountain) the fairest house not
of France only, but (as they say) of all Christendom. Indeed I have heard
travelers (who for the most part vilify their own Country in respect of
others) report, that it far exceeds both for beauty and bigness, the
largest and brauest of his Majesty's house; in England.

Northward lies the Dukedom of Valoys, whose prime City is Senlis, the second
Luzarch. This Dukedom gave name to all the French kings of the second branch
of the Capets; which beginning in Philip de Valoys, Ao 1328; ended in Henry the
3d, 1589. Westward to Paris lies the little Province of La Beause, whose chief
towns are 1 Chartres, Milles.
or (as the Latin writers call it) Carnutum. This town gives title to a
Vidame, or Vieedominus, an honor only used in France, whereof here also there
are but four, viz. this of Charters, 2ly of Amiens, 3l^ of Chalons, and 4ly of
Gerbery in Beavoys. The 2d town of this La Beause or Belsia, is Estampes.

son to Charles Martell, the Pope giving assent and approbatio^ to his
proceedings. Hist. of Fr.
This Pepi^ and his Father Martell we^^ Mayres of the Palace to the former
Kings. These Mayres were originally Comptrollers of the Kings house, and had
nothing to do with the affairs of State. But Clotayre the 2d to ease himself
and his successors of a burden so weighty; made the Mayres Vicars general of
his Empire. From henceforward the Kings followed the^r pleasures, showing
themselves only on Mayday; and then being seated in a chariot, adorned with
flowers, and drawn by four oxen: As for the Mayre he opens packets, heateth
and dispatcheth foreign Ambassadors, gives remedy to the complaints of the
subjects, makes Laws and repeateth them; an authority somewhat like that of
the Praefecti praetorio, in the time of the Roman Emperors. Under Degobert
the first, Pepin was Mayre; who continued in that office till the reign of
Clovis the third, and then he died, leaving his authority to Charles Martell
his base son. This Charles did to the Kings of France great service, for which
he was created Duke or Prince of the French. Yet would not he (though the
Estate was at his disposure) settle it in himself; it being his usual saying,
that he had rather rule a King, then be one. As for his son Pepin, he
succeeding his Father in authority but not in virtuous resolutions, was by Pope
Zachary the first invested with the Diadem of France; and the unfortunate king
Childericus, had his powle shaven, and was thrust into a Monastery. For this
investiture, both Pepin and his son Charles the great, did good service to the
Roman Prelates, and they to requite their kindnesses, gave unto the last, the
Empire of the West; and the title of most Christian King. The sons of this
most worthy Emperor, did most unworthily degenerate.

king, father to a king, yet he himself was no king. 7. 1328. 15. Philip of

Prince, with an handful of wearied soldiers, being in all but 8000, overcame
the French Army consisting of 40000 men; flew (besides the Nobles) 10000
soldiers, took prisoners king John and Philip his son, 70 Earls, 50 Barons,
and 12000 Gentlemen or thereabouts. 14. 1364. 16 Charles IV. called the Wise:

peace, was most villainously slain by Rauiliac. 21 1610 28 Lewis XIII now
living. To these 28 kings of the Capets, add 13 of the Carolouignians, and 21
of the Merouignians: and the whole number of the kings of France will amount to
62.
7. BERRY and BVRBON.
The Countries of BERRY and BVRBON are environed with Poictou, Limosin,
Avergne, the Duchy of Burgundy, and Champaine.

View of Fr.
Berry called in Latin Biturigum Regio, of the chief City Bituris, now
Bourges; is so stored with sheep, that when they take a man for too much lying
in a greater number then truth, they will say, Fie, there are not so many sheep
in Berry.

Th^s Province is watered with the river Cher, and contains 33 walled Towns;
the chief of which are 1 Bourges, formerly called Avaricum; the revolt of
which Town in Caesar's time, gave such a check to his proceedings, that he
was faigne to stretch his wit and valor on the tente^hookes, before it was
again yielded to him. It is said to have been built by Ogyges Noes
grandchild, who called it Bitogyges, which by corruption fell unto B^turiges;
an Etymology, that were it as dear bought, as fair fetched, it might have
been good for Ladies; sure I am it is not for Scholar. Others call it more
probably Bituris, quasi Biturris, from two fair Towers in this City erected;
one whereof is yet in part standing. Hereunto alludeth an ancient Grammarian,
Turribus a binis inde vocor Bituris.
From two Towers which were builded here
The name of Bituris I bear.
Calamenus calls it the honorour of all learning, and storehouse of learned
men, for it is indeed a flourishing University. 2 Sancerre, called of old Sacrum
Cereris, from Ceres, as it seems here, worshipped. It is a town of good
strength, and was consigned over unto the Protestants, 1570, as a town of
caution, for the more sincere observing of the articles of peace then newly
agreed on. 3 Argenton the title or honor of Philip de Comines, that excellent
historian; who diued so deeply into, and writ so plainly of the state
affairs; that Katherine di Medices used to say, that he had made as many
Heretics in policy, as Luther had in religion. He was from this town
vulgarly called Monseiur de Argenton. 4 Chasleau Rous.

This Country after the decease of Harpen, Paradin.
who going to the holy Land, sold it to K. ^hilip the first An. 1096. was
never aliened from the Crown, unless it were for the portion of the king,
younger son; which they call the Appennages.

Burbon is watered with the rivers of Loyre, and Allier: The chief ci^ties are
first Burbon (formerly Boya) naming the whole Province. 2 Molins upon a little
riuulet called Elaner. 3 Nevers honored with a Dukedom.

This Province in the days of the degenerate issue of Charles the great,
Paradin.
was seized on by the Dampiers: the last of which was Archemb^ld Dampierre,
whose daughter and heir Beatrix, was married to Robert younger son to Saint
Lewis 1308: from whom are descended the present Kings of France and Princes of
Conde.

To Burbon belong Beauoys and Averne. 1. Beauoys is a small Province, at the
Southeast of Burbon. The chief Towns are Be^ueiu and Ville Franche. Of the
first town Bea^ieau in the time of our Richard the first, Camd^n.
one Philip was Bishop: who being a martial man, and much annoying our border,
was by king Richard in a skirmish fortunately taken, and put in p^ison. The
Bishop complained to the Pope, who wrote in the behalf of his son as ^n
Ecclesiastical person, and a shepherd of the Lords. The King sent unto the
Pope the armor he was taken in, and engraued thereon the words, which Jacobs
sons used when they had sold their brother Joseph, and presented their father
with his coat, viz: Vide vtrum filij tui tunica sit velum: which the Pope
viewing, swore it was rather the coat of a son of Mars, then a son of the
Church: and so bid the King use his pleasure.

Paradine.
The first Lord of Beauoys was Omphroy, brother to Artand of Lyon^ys, Anno 989:
in whose issue it continued till the year 1400, or thereabout: when Edward the
last Lord dying without issue, gave it unto Lewis surnamed the Good. D. of
Burbon. 2 Averne is seated on the South of Burbon^ys. It is watered with the
Loyre which has his head in the Mountains of this country, and Eleuer. This
Province takes its name from the Averni over whom Ve^cingetorix, that so long
put Caesar to his trumpes with 238000 men, was King. He kept his residence at
Gergouia (now Clermont) the Metropolis of this Province: the next to which is
Saint ^loure, inumcible by reason of its situation. Camden in Scotia.
3 Claudes A^gues* 4 Marignes. Here is also the Town and signeurie of Aubigny,
which was given by Charles the sixth, to Robert, second son of Alan Steward
Earl of Lennox; and is still an honorary title among that noble family.

Paradin.
This Lordship was united to Burbon, 1^10. by the marriage of Duke John of
Burbon, and Bonne Countess of Avergne.

8. LIMOSIN.
LIMOSIN is environed with Berry, Poicton, X^intoigne, and Auergne: it has its
name quasi in Limo sita, from the dirty soil. This country is moistn^d with
the rivers Vienne and Vexerew. The chief Cities are Tulles on the South,
Tuviers and Maignai in the midland, and Limoges on the North. At the taking of
which last City newly revolted, Edward the Black Prince could by no means
be allured to pity the distressed Citizens; Du Chos^e.
ti^l persuing his enemies, he saw three French Gentlemen make head against
his army; the consideration of whose magnanimity drew him to pity, where
before he vowed revenge. And lastly Chaluz, at the besieging of which, our
Richard the first was slain by a shot from an Arbalist, the use of which
warlike engine he first showed unto the French. Whereupon a French Poet made
these verses in the person of Atropos. Hoc v^lo, non alia Richardum morte
perire,
Vt qui Francigonis Balistae primitus vsum
Trad dit; ipse su^^em primitus experiatur,
Quamque, alijs docuit, in se v^m sentiat ar^is.
It is decreed: thus must great Richard die,
As he that first did teach the French to dart
An A^bal^st; it is just he first should try
The strength, and taste the fruits of his own art.
The man which shot him was named Bertram de Gurdon, who being brought before
the King (for the King neglecting his wound, Daniels hist
never gave over the assault till he had mastered the place) boldly justified
his action, as done in defense of his country* and to revenge the death of his
father and brother whom this King had slain. Which said, the King caused him
to be set at liberty, and gave him 100 shillings sterling. When Henry the 3l of
England released his right in the Provinces of Normandy, Aniou, Poicteirs,
Toureine, and Maine, Anno 1259. Lewis the 9th, to whom this relea^e was made,
gave him in exchange 300000l of Amo^in money; the Duchy of Guyen; the
Country of Namtoigne as far as to the river Charen^; and this Limosin. Si^ce
which time it has been sometimes French, most time^ English, till their
general expulsion by Charles the 7th.

South west to Limosin is the little country Perigort, and more South is the
Province of Querc^, both which upon the capitulations made by John of France,
Martin.
then prisoner, and Edward the 3d of England; were delivered up to the English,
and from them again recovered by Charles the 7th. The chief Town^s of Quercu
are 1 M^untalbon in vain beseiged by the present French king Lewis in his wars
against those of the religion: this being one of their cautiona^ie, or pledge
Towns. It is s^tuate on the Garound. 2 Cahors, Maginus.
built on the rising of an hill, a beautiful rich City, and is of an ovall
form. The chief places of note in Perigort are 1 Perigeux, standing on the
small river Ila, in the very midst of this little country, whereof it is the
metropolis. and 2 Sarlat.

In the Northeastward corner of Limosin is an Elm, whose boughs extend
themselves into four Provinces, viz: Berry. 2 Burbon. 3 Auerne. 4 Limosin.

9. DAVLPHINE.
DAVLPHINE is environed with Auergne Westward, Prove^ce Southward, Savoy
Eastward, and Bresse Northward: and had this name from Daulphine wife to
Guigne, the second Prince of this Province. The Rhoane glideth all along the
Country, washing the walls of Lions (where it is conjoined with the Zone) a
famous Mart town and University, called formerly Lugdunum. Co^tnes.
These Marts were in former times holden at Geneva; from thence removed hither
by Lewis the 11th for the enriching of his own kingdom. And when Iulio the 2d
had excommunicated Lewis the 12th, he commanded by his Apostolical authority
that they should be transferred to Geneua again: but therein his pleasure was
never obeyed. As for the University questionless it is very ancient, for even
in the time of C. Caligula it was a sent of learning. For in this Town before
an Altar consecrated to Augustus, this Caligula instituted some Olympicke
games, as it were, of the Greek and Roman eloquence. The victor was honored
according to his merit, but the vanquished were either with their own tongues
to blot out their writings, to be ferulaed, or be drowned in the next river.
Hence that of Iuvenall, Lugdune^sem rhetor dicturus ad aram. Yet do I not
refer the beginning of the Academic to this, for doubtless it is far
younger. It is a very delicate town, and the Sea of an Archbishop, one of whom
was Irenaeus, that renowned man in the Primitive Church. 2 Valence which was
the title of Caesar Borgia, son to Pope Alexander the 6, who casting off his
Cardinals hatte was by Charles the 8th made Duke Valentinoys. 3 Vienna to
which Archelaeus son and successor to Herod the Ascalonite, King of the
Jews, was banished by Augustus. It is now famous in that in gives name to the
first son in France being entitled Daulphine of Viennoys. The more inward
Cities are Grenoble, where a Parliament was instituted Anno 1453. 2 Romans,
etc.

This country together with Provence and Savoy, Paradin.
were part of the kingdom of Burgundy, and so continued till the year 1101;
in which Henry the Emperor, being troubled by the thunders of Pope Gregory the
7th, alias Hildebrand, and his successors: Guigne the sat, Earl of
Grisinaudon, seized on this Prou^nce, naming it after the name of his son,
and successors wife; Daulphine. In this family, it continued til the year
1349 In which Humbert the last of this line, being surcharged with wars by
Ame Earl of Savoy, entered into an order of Religion: selling his country at a
small rate to Philip of Valoys King of France, on this condition, that the
h^ire apparent to the Crown, should be instiled Daulphine of Viennoys:
quartering his Arms with France, which are a Dolphine Hauriant Or, in a field
Azure.

Of all French governors he of Daulphine has the greatest privileges, View of
Fr.
having in his own power the disposing of all offices within the Province.

In the mountains bordering on this country, and lying between it, Hist. of
Fr.
Savoy, Provence, and Peidmont; there do dwell a sort of people which the
French call Vaudoys. These are the progeny of the Albigenses, which about the
year 1100, when the popish doctrine and jurisdiction began to settle to a
head: manfully stood for the liberty and purity of the Church; and kept on foot
the doctrine which from their predecessors they had received, which little
differed from that renewed by Luther and Calvin in after times. In the year
1250, or thereabouts, they were by a long and bloody war waged against them
by the Popes and French Kings; almost utterly rooted out: when under the
conduct of Raimond Earl of Toulouse, they had for 28 years made good their
side by ^orce of arms. The remainder of this people preferring their
consciences before their countries, retired up into these mou^tainous places.
Here they lived a godly and laborious life, painefully tilling the ground,
restoring hamlets, which formerly had been destroyed by war; and teaching
the very rocks in a manner to yield herbage for the nourishment of cattle:
insomuch that places which at their coming thither scarce yielded 4 crowns
yearly; were by their good husbandry made worth 350 crowns a year unto the
Lord of them. Lasciviousness in speech one with another they used not;
blasphemy against the honor of God they abhorred; neither was the name of the
devil at any time in their mouths: and this their enemies were enforced to
acknowledge and confess when they were afterward in troubles. All the faults
proved against them were, that when they came into any neighboring Churches
they prayed immediately to God, without relation to any of the Saints: and when
they came by Crosses erected in the high way, they bowed not before them. Thus
lived this poor people, neither embracing the Popes doctrine, nor
acknowledging his supremacy, the space of 300 years untouched and
unquestioned; even till the latter end of the reign of Francis the first. But
then persecutions raging against the Lutherans, they were accused, and
inhumanely handled in the massacre of Merindol and Cabrieres abouementioned.
Yet here unto this day they live and continue in the faith. If now the Papists
ask me where was our Church before the time of Luther; I answer that here it
was; that here God was worshipped according to the manner by himself
prescribed, and by the reformed Churches followed. Here I say were those few
Israelites hidden, which had not bowed their knees unto Baal.

10. LANGVEDOC.
LANGVEDOC is encompassed with the Pyrenean Hills, Gascoyne, the river
Rhodanus, or Rhoane, and the Mediterranean Sea. Whereas the other Frenchmen in
an affirmation say O^y these of this country say Oc; and therefore C^telues
conjectures it was called Langue d' oc: but the truth is, it took denomination
from the Goths, who reigning long in this country, left behind them a smacke of
their language; and therefore it was called Languegotia, and now Euphoniae
gratia, termed Languedotia, or Languedoc, that is the Goths language.

It is moistened with the currents of the Rivers Auraurius. 2 L^cran. 3 Orb.
and 4 Alby; from which last the Albigenses or Waldenses (who first stoutly
resisted the Popish doctrine and Supremacy) took their name. The first of
these disburdeneth it self into Rhen^, the last into the Sea. The chief
Cities are 1 Narbon, the first Roman Colonie (next after Carthage) out of
Italy. Brerewood.
In Italy it self were no less then 150 Colonies; 57 in Afric, 29 in
Spain; 26 in France; in England four only; in Syria 20; and in other
Countries some, but very few in respect of the largeness of the territories.
These Colonies were instituted partly to repress rebellions in the conquered
countries; partly to resist a foreign enemy; partly to reward the ancient
Soldiers; partly to relieve the poorer sort; and partly to purge and empty the
City of the superfluity and redundance of her people. Now if the question be
asked whether a Colonie or a Fortress be more behoofefull, I answer with
Boterus in his Ragg^^ distato, that a Fortress is more fit for sudden use;
and a Colonie for continuance: the former are quickly erected, and perhaps as
soon lost; the other require some time of settling, and are after of good
sufficiency to defend themselves. As we see in our times the Spanish Colonies
of Septa and Tanger in Afric: and our own in Calais, which was the last
town we lost on the firm land. This Narbon was in the infancy of the Roman
Empire, the most populous and greatest Town of all France: insomuch as from it
all this part of France was called Gallia Na^boncusis, a Province of which
Pliny delieureth us this censure; Narbonensis Gallia agrorum cultis, morum
virorumque dignatione, ^pum amplitudine nulli prouinciarum postponenda:
brevi^er^ (...) potius quam provincia. It was also called Gallia (...), from
the garments that the inhabitants did wear; which were much like to the
Trouzes which are worn by the Iriso footmen, and are called in Latin Bra^ca.
2 ^Mons pessulanus, or Montp^ller, where the present king of France i^ his wars
against those of the religion received a memorable defeat. It is seated on the
Sea side, and is an University famous for the study of Law and Physic. 3
Nismes, where are to be seen the relics of a Palace built by Adrian the
Emperor. 4 Agde. 5. Lodove.

Hist. of Fr.
In the falling of the Roman Empire, the Goths not only spoiled Italy, but
also France; erecting the kingdom of Ostrogothes in Italy, of the Visigothes,
or Western Goths, in Languedoc: and leaving Italy by compulsio^, erected
another kingdom of Ostrogothes, or Eastern Goths, in Provence. Charles the
great broke the neck of this kingdom, being sensibly salne almost to nothing;
and gave the title of Earl of Toulouse, being the Metropolis of the Gothish
Empire, to Thursin one of the race of the ancient kings, Ha^lla^,
on the condition he would be Christened: since which time the name and
Lordship of this Country lay buried under the title of Toulouse. In this race
it continued till after the year 1222. When Raimond the fist of that name, and
last of this race; favoring the doctrine of the Albigenses, was condemned for
an Heretic, cursed by the Pope, persecu^ed by the French Kings, Philip the
second, Lewis the 8th, and St Lewis: which last willing to make a peaceable
composition married his brother Alphonso, to Jane, daughter and heir to Count
Raimond, with this clause, that if it should happen these two to die without
issue, then Languedoc should be incorporated to the Crown. Raimond agreed, the
marriage was solemnized, Anno 1249. They both died without issue 1270; and
Languedoc returned to the Crown, in the days of Philip the third.

11. PROVENCE.
PROVENCE is environed with Languedoc, Daulphin, Peidmont, and the
Mediterranean Sea. It took its name from the Romans, who being called in by
the Marsil^a^s to revenge a private wrong, wholly possessed themselves of this
country, calling it (...) The Province.

The river Durance runs through, and Rhoane divides it from Languedoc. It
is now divided into three parts, whereof the greatest belongs to the Crown
of France. the next to the Bishops of Rome, and the last to the Princes of
Orange: the causes of which division follow.

There is no means so easy to ruin a flourishing Commonwealth, as upon a
private grudge, to call in a foreign power. This the Marsilians felt, Hist. of
Fr.
when making a gappe by their private d^ssentions for the Romans, they
submitted themselves to the yoke of an imperious nation: to whom
notwithstanding they continued subject, till Stillico Captain to Honorius the
Emperor, called the Burgundians into France, to expel the French then newly
entered. This people erected their Burgundian kingdom, of which this Country
was a member, till from them it was wrested by the Ostrogothes, Anno 504. But
this Empire decaying, it fell to the lot of Lewis, son to Lewis the Gentle,
son to Charles the great: together with Burgundy and Italy. The daughter of
this Lewis, Hermingrade; was married to Boson Earl of Ardennes, from whose
second son Lewis, the Berengarij took both Italy and Provence. Their issue
inioyed it, till the Lady Doulce conveyed it by a marriage to Raymond Earl of
Barcelone, Hist. of Sp
Ao 1082: whose son being called to the crown of Arragon, brought Provence
and Catelogne for his dowry. His son Alphonso the second, gave it to his
second Son Raimond: and by the marriage of Beatrix daughter of Raymond, with
Charles Earl of Aniou, this Country fell into the lap o^ France, Anno 1262.
This Earl Charles, by Pope Urban the fourth, was crowned king of Naples; whose
fourth successor Q. Ioane being driven out of Naples by Lewis of Hungary, and
again restored by Clement the sixth; gave to him as a recompense of his favor,
the City of Avignion, and the territories about it, Anno 1352. This Country
is called the Country Venusine, the Metropolis is Avignion, a very fair City
seated on the Rhosne: famous for that it was the seat of the Popes for 70
years, which time the people of Rome remember till this day, by the name of
the Babylonian Captivity; ever since ministering an Oath at the confirmation of
their Pope, that he shall never return to Avignion. The first Pope that
removed his seat hither, Stephanu^
was Clement the 5, Anno 1305, when as yet the Popes were not absolute masters
of it; and it was returned again to Rome by Gregory the 9th, Anno 1376. In
this City are said to be 7 Palaces, 7 parish churches, 7 Monasteries, 7
Nunneries, 7 Colleges. 7 Innes, and 7 Gates. It was made an University about
the time of the Popes first settling there and still continues so. Alciate the
great Emblematist was Professor here. Sands relat.
This Country contains also 3 Cities (viz: 1 Ca^pentras. 2 Cavailan 3
Veson) and 80 walled Towns. The profits the Pope gathers from hence are not
great, by reason of the ill neighborhood of the Protestants of Orange: nay
rather the keeping of this Country is a charge unto him; So that the people
like well to be under his government, as bringing more unto them then he takes
from them.

Hist. of Fr.
The forementioned Ioane dying, made Lewis Duke of Aniou, brother to Charles
the first, her heir: who possessed by this donation, this Provence, and the
title of Naples. His grandchild Rhene, dying without any issue suruiuing him,
gave all his titles and possessions to Lewis the 11th King of France 1480. This
Lewis in that troublous war against the three Dukes, made John of Chalons, a
Tributary Prince of Orange, of free power and absolute jurisdiction: to make
laws, coin money, pardon all crimes, with to write himself By the Grace of
God Prince of Orange: and all other prerogatives fitting an absolute Potentate,
Anno 1275.

Ortelius.
This principality is watered with the rivers Durance. 2 Seille. 3 Meine. and 4
Ecque, all helping to augment the Rhoane.

The chief Cities are Orange on the river Meine; famous for her rare and
wonderful antiquities: in Latin Aurlacus, or Aurengia. 2 Estang. 3 Boys de St
Poll.

Re^sner.
Claudia daughter and heir to John Prince of Orange, son to John the first
free Prince of this territory* was by Francis the first given in marriage to
Henry Earl of Nassaw, coming in an embassy from the Emperor Maximilian, Ano
1515. Rhe^^ son to this Henry dying without issue, made William his Uncle
heir to all his estates; whose son William so renowned for Martial
exploits, and deeds of Arms in the Netherlands, was slain treacherously by a
Partizan of Spain, Anno 1584. leaving Maurice Prince of Orange, and Earl of
Nassaw heir to his fortunes and virtues.

The revenues of this principality are about 30000 crowns yearly.

The Arms are quarterly, Bara.
1 Gules, a bend Or. 2 Or, a hunters horn Azure, stringed Gules. The third as
etc. over all an Escutcheon of pretense, chequi, Or and Azure. More briefly
thus. Quarterly Chalons and Aurange, under an Eschotcheon of Geneua.

In the king of France his part, are 1 Marseiles, a famous Mart Town, a
Colonie of the Phocians. 2 A^x, where a Parliament was instituted, Ano 1501.
This town was of old called Aquae Sextiae, Plutarch.
of Sextius its founder, and the hot bathes. By this town were the Cimbri
discomsited by Marius; who unwilling to venture his army on the enemy united,
(for they were no less than 300000 fighting men; and lately fleshed in the
overthrow of Manlius and Cepio, two Consulls:) permitted them quietly to pass
by his Camp; the Barbarians in their passage scorneful^y asking his soldiers
what service they would command them to Rome. But when for their easier march
through the Alps, the Cimbri had divided themselves into three companies;
Marius severally setting on them al, put them all to the sword, by this victory
only giving the Romans cause not to curse his nativity. 3 Arles (Arelatum) the
Metropolis of the Burgundian kingdom, lately strengthened and new fortified by
Henry the 4th. In this town was called a Council by Constantine, Anno 313,
for the quiet establishing of the Church: wherein was present Restitutus Bishop
of London, and diverse others: Ausonius calls this town the Rome of France,
and indeed so highly was it prized in old time, that Constantinus Flauius being
chosen Emperor by the British Legions, intended to have made it the seat of
his Empire. 4 Brignolls, etc.

12. PICARDIE and CHAMPAGNE.
PICARDY and CHAMPAGNE are hemmed round with Normandy, Belgia, Loreyne, both
the Burgundies, Berry, Burbon and France.

Picardy is divided into the higher and the lower. In the higher are these
towns, 1 Calais distant from Dover about 28, or 30 miles, called by Caesar,
Portus Iccius. This City was taken by Edward the 3 d after eleven months
siege, Anno 1347: and lost again by Queen Mary after 200 years possession,
Anno 1557. in less then a fortnight. The loss of this Town was a great blow
to our state, we til then having carried the keys of France (for so the French
used to say) at our girdles. And as great a grief was it to the unfortunate
Queen, who shortly after dying, told such as attended her, that if they opened
her, they should find Callice to lay next to her heart. 2 Bullen taken by
Henry 8. Anno 1544. and yielded again in Edward the sixts days. 3 Terwin
taken by the same king Henry. To him lying at the siege of this town,
Guiceiardin
the Emperor Maximilian came and served in person, wearing on his breast the
English cross, and fighting under the colors of St George. At this siege the
French intending to victual the Town, received a great overthrow; insomuch
that had the Englishmen followed their fortune, they had opened a fair way to
have made themselves masters of a France; and certain it is, that the French
King upon the news, had prepared himself to fly into Brittanie But the
English more minded the spoils and riches of Terwin, then the sequel of an
absolute victory, and frui maluerunt victoria, quam vti, as Florus said of
Annibal.

In the lower Picardie, the chief towns are 1 St Quintins. 2. Abbeville, two
strong frontire Towns. 3 Peronne. 4 Ami^ns, the loss of which town much
blemished the reputation of Henry the 4th, the recovery thereof as much
repairing it. I omit the stratagem by which this town was taken from him. In
the great Church hereof, our Edward the 3d did homage to Philip de Valoys,
Hist. of Fr.
for the Duchy of Gui^nne; and because the like duties are seldom by Kings
personally performed, I will describe the formality. Edward came with a train
rather to honor himself, then the French King. He was royally att^red with a
long roabe of crimson Velvet, powdered with Leopards of gold; his Crown on his
head, his sword by his side, and golden spurs on his heels. Philip attended
by the chief officers of his Realm, sat in his Throne: he was ^pparelled in
a long robe of purple Velvet, powdered with flower delyces of Gold, his Crown
on his head, his Scepter in his hand. Vicount Melun great Chamberlain of
France, commands Edward to take off his Crown, Sword, Spurs, and to kneel
down: which he does. Then he took both his hands and joined them both
together, saying, You become a liege ^an to the King my Master, who is here
present, as Duke of Gu^en, and Peer of France; and you promise to be fa^^hfull
to him and loyal: say yea. And Edward said yea; and aro^e. 5 Monstreville, and
6 Guise ^a^^us only for the Dukes which in our age it has yielded to the
realm of France. The first was Claude son t^ Rene Duke of Lorreine, and
husband to Antonietta, daughter to the Duke of Vandosme: in respect of which
alliance he was honored with this title. The 3d was Francis, Paradin*
who endangered the Realm of Naples; who resisted the great siege of the
Emperor Charles at Mets; drove him out of Provence; and was at last slain at
the seige of Orleans, Anno 1572. This was he which took Callice from Queen
Mary; so that had Monseiur de Cords now lived, he might have had his desire:
for he used to say, that he would be content with all his heart to lie in hell
7 years, on condition that Callico were taken from the English. The 3d was
Henry that great enemy of the Protestants: who contrived the great massacre at
Paris, and almost dispossessed Henry the 3d of all France. He began the holy
league, and was finally slain at Bloys; the league suruiuing the author.

Picardie had once diverse Lordshipps, some fell to the Kings of France, by
confiscation, others by conquests; some held of Arteys, Haill^^.
others of Flaunders, and lastly of the Dukes of Burgundy, as Lords of these
Provinces: and after the death of Charles Duke of Burgundy, at the battle of
Nancie, Anno 1476; were all seized on by Lewis the 11th of France.

The chief Cities of Champaigne so called, for that it is a Champion
country, are 1 Rheimes, where the Kings of France are most times crowned, and
anointed with an oil kept in this Town; which they say came down from
heaven and never decreaseth. Seldom.
How true this is, may quickly be perceived, considering how Gregory of Tours,
who is so prodigal of his miracles, makes no mention of i^ but especially,
(for ab autoritate non valet argumentum negative) since the legend informing us
how this oil was sent from heaven, at the anointing of Cloui^ the first
Christian King of France, is absolutely contradicted by their best and most
judicious writer Du Haillan: who affirms Pepin to have been the first
anointed King, and that there was none de la primiere lignee oinct ny sacre a
Reimes, nyalleiurs: none of the first or Mer^vignian line of kings, were
anointed at Rheimes or elsewhere How ever the truth be, the Frenchmen
wonderfully reverence this oil, and at the Coronation of their Kings fetch it*
from the Church where it is kept, with great solemnity. For it is brought by
the Prior sitting on a white ambling Palfrey, Sl^^d. com.
and attended by his Monks; the Archbishop of this Town, and such Bishops
as are present, going to the Church door to meet it; and leaving for it with
the, Prior some gage; and the King when it is by the Archbishop brought to
the Altar, bowing himself before it with great reverence. This town takes
name from the Rhemi, once a potent nation of these parts; and is an University,
wherein among other Colleges, there is one appointed for the education of young
English Fugitives. The first Seminary for this purpose erected, was at Doway
1568. a second at Rome, by Gregory the 13th: a third at Valadolit by Philip the
2d: a fourth at Lovaino: a fif^ (so much is the gaining of our nation to the
Roman faith sought after) at this place by the Guisians. The Priests here
living translated the new Testament into English, which we commonly call the
Rhemish Testament, Martin.
so learnedly confuted by Dr Fulke, and Mr Cartwright. The second town of note
is Troys, famous for the meeting of Charles the sixth and Henry the fifth, kings
of France and England: in which that victorious K. Henry was espowsed to the
Lady Catharine, daughter to the aboue-named Charles the sixth. It was here also
agreed that Charles the Dolphin, and afterward the 7th of that name, being
disherited; King Henry should be proclaimed, and acknowledged for the heir
apparent to the French Crown: that he should be Regent of the Realm during
the life of the old King: with diverse other articles, framed as best suited
with the honor and will of the conqueror. 3 Brie which was once fellow in
the title of Earldom with Champaigne. 4 Montargis. 5 Sons. 6 Auxerre. 7

The chief rivers of these two Provinces, are 1 Marne. 2 Aube. 3 Yone, which
empty themselves into Sequana, or Seine: and lastly Some, which runs into
the Ocean, at the Haven town St Vallerie.

Provinces; confirming on the Normans, Neustria; giving to Geofrie Grisogonelle,
Aniou: to Od^ a man of great power, Brie, and Champaigne: well knowing that a
gift willingly given, cannot but be gratefully received, and requited by an
ingenuous spirit. This Odo then was the first Earl of Brie, and Champaigne, Ao
999. This Earldom by the marriage of Earl Thibauld, and Blanch Queen of
Navarre, Ao 1196; was annexed to that Pyrenean kingdom; under which it
continued till 1284, when Philip the fair of France marrying Ioane Queen of
Navarre, and Countess of Brie, and Champaigne, united it to his Diadem: which
his successors have since kept, as lying too nigh Paris, to be in a foreign
hand; giving in exchange to the Navarroy's, certain towns, and lands in
Languedoc.

13. THE DVTCHIE OF BVRGVNDIE.
THE DVTCHIE OF BVRGVNDY is environed with Champaigne, Hist. of Fr.
the County Bress, and Burbonoys. It takes its name from the Burgundians, who
called by Stillico to repress the Francones, here seated themselves; and
erected their kingdom, containing both the Burgundies, Savoy, Daulphine,
Provence, and many other places of less note. But of these Burgundians we
shall speak more anon.

That which Queen Katharine was wont to say, that France had more rivers then
all Europe beside; may in like manner be said of this Province in respect of
France: having in it these Rivers. 1 Armacon, 2 Seram, 3 Cure, 4 Torney, 5
Valence, 6 Daue, 7 Soane, 8 Brune, 6 Senie, 10 Louche.

The chief Cities are 1 Digion, Ortelius.
proud in her Parliament instituted Ao 1476. and that it was built by the
Emperor Aurelian, and that in her Saint Bernard was first shown unto the
world. 2 Antun, sometimes the capital City of the Dukedom, and a Bishops
Sea. 3 Beaulne, where there is an hospital equal to the Palace of any Prince
in Europe. 4 Verdu^'s Sologne 6 Chalons belonging to the house of Ora^ge. 7

then what it is. For this, though now but a small Village, was once that
famous City of Alexia wherein Julius C^sar besieged Vercingetorix King of the
Auernians, having in the City for the defense of it 70000 fighting men: and
being himself* besieged by an army of no fewer th^n 300000 Gauls, which came
to relieve their fellows. Caesar was now driven to the trial of his valor,
which he notably man fested. For ^he fortified his Camp with two walls one
against the^. within the City, and the other against them without; and so
providently kept watch and ward, that the besieged knew the discomfiture of
their friends, before they heard of their coming. To conclude, Vercinget^rix
yielded the Town, and being bravely mounted, he rode round about Caesar, then
sitting in his chair of state; which done he alighted from his horse, unarmed
himself, took of his horses caparisons, and laying all on the ground, sat
down at Caesar's feet, as his prisoner.

Within this Province stands the Earldom of Charoloys, the usual title of
the elder Son of Burgundy, Bara*
who is called the ^arle of Charoloys. The Arms of it are Gules, a Lion
passant regardant Or, armed Azure. The chief Towns are Clugni, and Mascon.

Hist. of Fr.
Burgundy, which with the sorementioned Provinces, made a kingdom, was by the
issue of Charles the Great, divided into two parts: the County, which was to
appertain to the Empire; and the Duchy, the lot of the French kings. These
g^ue it to one Richard of the house of Saxony, 890, whose son Rodolph had his
temples invested with the royal garland of France. This Richard was first son
to Robert Earl of Aniou, whose eldest son Eudes was King of France; his
third Robert Earl of Aniou, and this Richard Duke of Burgundy. Paradin.
For want of Heirs thi^ Duchy divolued to the Crown, was by Henry the
first, given to Robert h^s brother, Ao 1004 This Line again expired, it was
given by King Charles to his brother Philip the hardy, Ao 1363. together with
the County; which had bin formerly united to the Duchy, by the marriage of
Joan, Countess of Burgundy, to Duke Eudes, Ao 1331. Philip, grandchild to
this Philip, united to his Duchy well nigh all the Belgic Provinces, and
died leaving Charles his son; who imbarquing himself in a troublous war
against Lewis the eleventh, lost his men, money, and life, at the battles of
Granson, Morat, and Nancie, 1476: after whose death this Duchy was seized on
by the French^

These Provinces are all incircled in the girdle of the French government, View
of Fr.
containing besides Cities, 34 Havens, having all some properties of a good
Harbor, viz. 1 Room, 2 safety, 3 easiness of defense. 4 concourse of
forreiners.

The Arms of France in the days of Pharamond, Paradin.
were Gules, 3 Crowns Or: Clouis the great, altered them to Azure, Semi of
Flower de Luces, Or: Charles the sixth to Azure, 3 Flower de Luce^, Or.

The chief orders of Knighthood in this Kingdom were first of the Gennet,
Grimston.
founded by Charles Martell, Mayor of the French Palace, and so called, either
from Jane his wife, as Hailan would have it: or from the Gennets of Spain,
over whom he triumphed at the battle of Tours, as Bellay writes. It ended in
the days of S^ Lewis: the knights of the order wore a Ring, wherein was
engraven the form of a Gennet.

2. Of the Pa^rrie or twelve Peers, View of Fr.
so called, quasi pares inter se, instituted by Charles the Great in his wars
against the Sarac^ns. Six of these were of the Clergy. 1, the Archbishop and
Duke of Rhemes; 2 the Archbishop and Duke of Laon. 3, the Archbishop and Duke
of Langers; 4 Bishop and Earl of Beauoys. 5 Bishop and Ea^le of No^on; And 6,
Bishop and Earl of Chaelons. And six others of the temporalitie, 1 The Duke
of Burgundy; 2 Duke of Normandy; 3 Duke of Guyenne; 4 Earl of Toulouse; 5
Earl of Champaigne; 6 Earl of Flaunders. These are they so much memoriz'd in
the Legends of the old French writers. At this time the ancient Pairries of the
Temporality are returned to the Crown, and new erected in their places.

3. Of the Star^e, begun by John of France, Ao 1352. They wore about their
necks a Collar of gold, at the which hanged a Star, the word, Monstrant
regibus astra viam: this order was disgraced by his son Charles, in
communicating it to his guard, and so it ended.

4. Of Saint Michael, instituted by King Lewis the eleventh, Anno 1469: It
consisted of thirty six Knights, which afterward were augmented to 300. They
wore a Collar wouen with Cockle shells; Seld^^.
the word, Immensi tremor Oceani. It took the name from the picture of Saint
Michael, conquering the devil, which was annexd' to the Collar. Some think
that the invention of Saint Michael, was in allusion unto the 10th of Daniel:
Others say he took Saint Michael in regard of an apparition of that Saint, to
his Father Charles the 7 on Orleance bridge, in the wars against the English.

5. Of the Holy Ghost, ordained by Henry the third, Ao 1570. The Knights are
sworn by solemn Oath, to persecute the Hugonots, and favor the Romish
Catholics. Their Robe is a black velvet mantle, powdered with Lillies, and
flames of gold and silver; none are admitted to this order, who cannot prove
their Nobility, by three descents at least. The Collar is of Flowers de lys,
and flames of gold; with a Cross, and a Dove on it, pendant. The reason of the
institution was, because the order of Saint Michael began to grow too common
among the undeserving; which order he took not away, but mingled with this; it
being by him ordained, that the next day aster the Collar of the Holy Ghost is
given; that of Saint Michael should be added, if the honored had it not
before. It was called by the name of the Holy Ghost, because this Henry was on
a Whitsunday chosen King of Poland.

I omit the other petty orders: as those of the Cock and Dog, by them of
Montmorencie; of the Porcupine, by them of Orleance; and the Thistle by them of
Burbon.

14. COVNTIE OF BVRGVNDIE.
Ortelius.
Within the limits of France are three Countries which as yet acknowledge not
the French command, viz, 1 Savoy, 2 Lorrain, 3 the COUNTY of BVRGVNDY. The last
is environed with Champaigne, Lorreine, Switzerland, Bress, and the Duchy;
the length of it is ninety miles, the breadth sixty.

The people are much renowned for warlike affairs, marching under the colors
of diverse Princes, under the name of Wallons. This name is given unto this
people by the Dutch, who using W for G, instead of Gallons (or Galloys) call
them Wallons. Others report, that when the Burgundians came first into Gaul,
they asked the people of the Country running to see them, On allons, that is,
whither go we; and that thereupon they got the name of Wallons: a proper
invention, and of the same pitch as that of the Hugonots.

The ground is so exceeding fertile, that as France may be called the Garden
of all Europe; so may this be termed the Epitome of France, or the fairest
flower of that Garden.

The ancient inhabitants of the Duchy were the Segusiani, of this County the
Hedui.

This Country is enriched with the rivers, Ortelius.
1 Soane, 2 Love, 3 Dayne, and 4 Doux, upon whose banks leans the fair and
strong city of Besanson, the Metropolis of both the Burgundies. It was made an
University, Ao 1540; by the joint authority of Iulio the 3, and Charles 5. 2
Dole seated on the same river; a town for strength, riches, and beauty, to be
preferred before any in Burgundy. Sands r^l.
Here is an University of long continuance, and therein a College of the
Jesuits, who fearing left the reformed doctrine might creep in upon them,
have not only debarred the people of the Protestants books; but expressly
also forbid them to talk of God, either in good sort, or bad. 3 Sal^es, glad
of her rich salt Fountain. 4 Gray, 5 Arbois, 6 Poutenant, 7 Ch^stilion, and
about 23 more walled towns, and 160 Lordships.

The Burgundians were a Nation bordering on the Vandalls; Pezelius in Sleidann^.
or as some conjecture a ^ept or tribe of them. At the time that Drusus and
Tiberius warred in Germany, they were a people utterly barbarous, dwelling in
tents only here and there clap^ed up. These tents are in that language called
Burgs, whence it is probably thought, the name of Burgundy was given unto them:
in the same sense that the name of Sceni^ae, was given unto the^ of Arabia for
the like kind of living. In the year 416. at the instigation of the Vand^ls
they left their own seats, and first planted themselves in the towns and
Villages, which now belong to the Marquesses of Baden, Munster.
and ^lectours of the Rhene. Hence wi^h an army of 80000 men, they passed the
river, and subdued all France between the Rhene and the Alps, East and West:
Lorreine and the Mediterranean, North and South: in which tract are
comprehended both Burgundies, Daulphine, Lyonoys, Bresse, Savoy, and Provence.
The seat royal was Arles. In this kingdom reigned successively 1 Tibica, 2
Gund^mar, 3 Gundeband, 4 Sigismund, and 5 Gundecar, who lost himself and his
kingdom to the French. Yet did the people ever and anon try all means to
regaine their liberty and kingdom, till the days of Charles the Great, who
utterly subdued it. In the divisions of his conquests by the sons of Lewis
the gentle, French hist.
Burgundy was divided into the Duchy, which was allotted to the Kings of
France; and the County, which together with the incorporate Provinces, was the
portion of Lewis, entitled king of Burgundy, and Italy, (for this last also
fell to his lot.) Hermingrade daughter and heir to this Lewis, was married to
Boson Earl of Ardennes, (which is a part of Luxenb^urg^) and had by him two
sons, Lewis and Ralph. To Lewis was assigned the Kingdom of Arles,
containing Italy and Provence: to Ralph the Kingdom of Burgundy, comprehending
this County, Daulphine, Savoy, Bresse, and Lyonoys. This Ralph being in the
year 919, vanquished by one Burchard a Germane Prince, Munster
and not able to subsist of himself; put himself and his Realm into the
protection of Otho the first, Ao 930. To Ralph succeeded his son Conradus,
and after him an other Ralph; lastly a second Conradus, who Ao 1025. gave his
kingdom unto Conradus Salicus, Emperor of Germany; under whose rule it
continued entire. But in the reign of his successor Henry the 4th, grievously
troubled with Hildebrand, Paradin.
and the Popes; Otho of Flanders laid hold on this County, defended ^t, and
left it to his children, Anno 1101. The other three which Paradi^e puts
before this Otho Guillaume, I take rather as Governors for the Emperor, then
themselves. This Otho pretended title to it as being son to the sister of
Conradus Salicus; a weak title, did we not see greater estates surprised on
lesser pretenses. This notwithstanding, the succeeding Emperors of Germany,
claimed not only a supe^i^tendencie over, but a disposal of all the Countries
that ever were under the command of a King of Burgundy. Daniell.
Henry the sixth, Emperor; receiving no small part of the money, which our
Richard the first paid to the Duke of Austriae for his ransom; gave unto the
said Richard the kingdom of Burgundy; the sovereignty of Provence, Viennoys,
Marseiles, Narbon, Arles, and Lions; together with the homages of the King of
Arragon, and of the Earl of Digion, and Saint Giles. A royal gift, if either
the Emperor had had any domination over those countries; or if they would have
received any officer of his appointing.

Anno 1331; Paradine.
the County and Duchy were united by the marriage of Duke Eudes, and Ioane the
Countess, which was daughter to Philip the long, and Ioane daughter to Earl
Otheline. Their issue failing, the County together with the Duchy were given
to Philip, surnamed the Hardy, Anno 1369. This Philip had to wife Marguerit,
Countess of Flanders, which was the first of the Belgic Provinces, that was
incorporated into the house of Burgundy* Ph^lip the Good, grandchilde to this
Philip, united under his Empire almost all the Netherlands, as you may see in
the descr^ption of those Countries. After his death, and the death of his son
Charles, Burgundy Duchy was surprised by Lewis the 11, who pretended an
escheat thereof for want of heirs male. But the County as heing holden of the
Empire, he left unto the Lady Mary, daughter and heir to this Charles. She was
married to Maximilian Emperor, and Archduke of Austria; whose son Philip
married to Ioane Queen of Castile and Arragon, had two sons, Charles and
Ferdinand: to the latter he bequeathed his inheritances in Germany; to Charles
Spain, Burgundy, and Belgia; whose great grandchild Philip the 4th, now
goue^neth these countries.

The arms of this Earldom are B, a Lion rampant O, Semie of billets, A. The
arms of the Duchy are Bendwaies Or and Az^re, a bordure Gules. This last
coat is usually marshalled among the arms of the King of Spain; but why the
arms of the Earldom are there omitted, I cannot say, unless it be to put
the king in mind of his pretenses to the Duchy, or that this as being
worthier, comprehends under it the rest also.

15. LORREINE.
Ortelius.
LORREINE is compassed about with part of Belgia, Alsatia, the County of
Burgundy, and Champaigne: The former name of it was Austrasia, being then of a
far greater extent then now it is: it borrowed the name of Lotharingia, from
Lotharius, Nephew to Charles the Great, by his son Lewis.

The length of it; is about some four days journey, the breadth almost three;
and is sufficiently famous in that that famous warrier Godfrey surnamed of
Bulloigne, which won Jerusalem from the Turks, was Duke here.

This Country abounds with corn and wine, an excellent race of horses,
plenty of mines, store of salt and fish.

Grimstons estates.
The people (as neighbors to both) participate of the French complement, and
German drinking, but more moderatly then either: They are hardy and politic,
as they which cannot otherwise maintain their state, bordering upon so many
Princes. They live in a very happy condition under their Duke, grow daily more
rich, and are not oppressed at all with taxes: which make them affectionate
unto him, and loving one toward another.

Here is in this Country good store of Lakes replenished with fish; but one
there is of most note, being 14 miles in compass, the fish whereof yields to
the Duke 2000l yearly.

The rivers of chief note are 1 Martha, or the Meure; 2 Mosa, or Meuse,
Grimston
and 3 Moselle: this last river is famous for the design which Lucius Verus,
governor here under Nero, had upon it. For whereas it arises in the mountain
Vogese, not far from the head of the river Soane; and disburdeneth if self
into the Rhene at confluence: he intended to have cut a deep and large channel
from the head of this river, to the head of the Soane, that so there might be a
more quick and easy pass from the Mediterranean into the Ocean; the Soane
emptying it self into the Rhone; and the Moselle into the Rhene.

The chief towns are 1 Nancie seated on the Meure, the Dukes seat; and
famous for the discomfiture which Charles Duke of Burgundy here suffered, with
the loss of his life. 2 Saint Nicholas a town so populous, well seated, and
neatly built, that were it walled, it would hardly yield precedencie to Nanci^
It took name from the body of Saint Nicholas, here buried, whose relics have
purchased no small reputation and riches to this town. 3 Va^eoleur, the place
of Ioane the Virgin, to whose miracles and valor, the French attribute the
delivery of their country from the Empire of the English; but being at last
taken prisoner, she was by the Duke of Bedford then Regent of France,
condemned, and burned for a Witch. 4 Ponta Moson so called for a bridge built
over the Meuse. 5 Neufe Chateau. 6 Vaudemant. The^e are also three towns, of
right belonging to the Empire, within the precincts of this Duchy, viz: Mets,
^oul, and Verdun: all which were taken by the French, Anno 1552, in the wars
between Charles the 5, and the Princes of ^ermany.

There belongs hereunto the country of Barroys, standing between it and
Champaigne, and is environed with the two streams of the river Marne; whereof
the one rising in the edge of Burgundy, the other in the edge of L^rreine, meet
together at Chalens in Champaigne. The chief towns are 1 Barleduc a strong
town, 2 La Mott, 3 Arg, and 4 Ligni. The eldest son of Lorreine is entitled
Prince of Barri. Lorreine also contains one Marquess, five Earledonies, and
diverse Baron^es.

When the Germans chose themselves an Emperor, this Province was the cause of
many troubles between them and the French; the former keeping possession, the
latter pretending a title Charles son to Lewis the 4th king of France, Hist.
of Fr.
being left to the courtesy of his brother, and by him not regarded; was
invested in this Duchy by Otho the Emperor, Anno 981. for which cause he
showed himself so alienated from the French, and wedded to the Germans; that
the French after the death of his Cousin Lewis the 5, rejected him, and chose
Hugh Capet for their King. This Charles had one son name Otho, (who leaving
no issue male, instituted one Godfrey, from whom descended Godfrey of
Bulloigne, his successor) and one daughter called Hermingrade, from whom came
Isabell, wife to Philip the second; uniting the bloods of Pepin, and Hugh
Capet, to the great content of her grandchild St Lewis, who being a man of very
tender conscience, is said never to have joyed in the Crown of France, till it
was proved that by his mothers-side he was the right Heir of Charles of
Lorreine, whom Hugh Capet had so unjustly dispossessed. This principality
continues to this day without any great alteration of lineage.

The Arms of Lorreine are Or, a Bend Gules, charged with three Larkes Argent.
But herein I find Bara the old and expert Herald, to differ from Paradine, the
most exact Genealogist of the French Nation. For Bara says that the Bend is
charged not with three allouettes Larkes; as Paradine, but with three
Allerions, or Allelyons, which are in blazon, small birds wanting beak, feet
and legs. Of this last opinion is that most worthy Antiquary Camden
Clarencieux, who withal tells us, that when Godfrey of Bulloigne was at the
siege of Jerusalem, shooting at Saint David's tower there, he broched three
feetlesse birds called Allerions upon his arrow, Grimston.
and thereupon assumed this arms.

The revenues of this Prince are 700000 Crowns, whereof 200000 arise from the
customs of the salt made in his Country, and the other 500000 from his
Coron^t lands. He is an absolute Prince and gives for his device an armed
arm, coming as it were from Heaven, and grasping a naked sword; to show that
he holds his estate by no other tenu^e, then God and his sword.

16. SAVOY.
The Dukedom of SAVOY is confined with Daulphine, Bresse, Switzerland, and
Peidmont.

This Country for the straight and narrow passages, and them too full of
thieves, was once called Malvoy; till a worthy adventurer of the Country, with
industry and exemplary justice, reformed both the vileness of the people, and
the passages: then was it called Savoy, or Salvoy, quasi Salva via.

Within the limits of this Dukedom stands the famous city of Geneva, being
yet but two English miles in circuit, and having territories streaching no
farther then two leagues and a half on each side: The revenue thereof is about
60000 crowns. The town stands at the end of the Lake Lemanus, and by Rhoane
is divided into two parts. The government is by a common Council, consisting of
200; the four chief whereof are called Syndiques.

Their Ministers cannot but be poor, having no tithes but stipends; the
greatest whereof comes not to 80 pounds yearly: and after this rate also is it
with the Clergy, in all the Churches of France and Germany, which follow the
Discipline of Geneva: For the tithes are taken by the Civil Magistrate, and
distributed partly among the poor, partly laid up in the common treasury: But
out of this there is again some portion deducted, to bestow the daughters, and
bring up the sons of such of the Ministers, who die poor, or leave their
children unprovided; the most commendable part in my conceit, of the whole
Discipline.

The Church-gouernment consists of a Miscellany of Laymen and Ministers, M.
Hooker
which government was begun by Mr Calvin, Anno 1541: and has since without
mature consideration bin headily received in most Churches of France and
Belgia. The people had banished their Bishop 1535, and then seeing Calvin, and
two of his Fellow-Ministers, usurp the prerogative, though not the title of
Bishops, banished all three. Desiring to recall him again, they were content
to receive a Discipline, if not ouer-prejudiciall to the City: Calvin framed
this, consisting of two Laymen annually chosen for every one Minister; which
also with much grumbling was received by them.

This City was once divided betwixt the Bishop and the Savoyen; till at last
the Bishop got the entire possession, leaving the Duke the sovereignty and
homage; in whose name, laws were made, and money was coined. But the people
having banished their Bishop, have stood since on their own liberty; and aided
by England with 13000; by Venice with 24000 Crowns; and by Florence with
intelligence, resisted the great siege of the D. of Savoy, Anno 1589. They
allow all manner of honest recreations upon Sundaies; Fornication they punish
with nine days fasting; Adultery with death. They have a law, that if any
Malefactor fly to them for refuge* they punish him after the custom of the
place in which the crime was committed: otherwise, Sands rel.
their town being on the borders of di^ers Provinces, would never be free from
Vagabonds. Examples hereof I will assign two; the first of certain Monks, who
robbing their Convents of certain plate, and hoping for their wi^ked prankes
at home, to be the welcomer hither, were at th^i first acquaintance advanced to
the gallows. The second is of a Spanish Gentleman, who having fled his country
for clipping and counterfeiting the Kings gold; came to this town, and had the
like reward. And when for defense he alleged that he understood their City
being free, gave admission to all offenders; true (said they) but with an
intent to punish them that offended; a distinction which the Spaniard neue^ til
then learned, but then was too late.

The chief Cities of Savoy are first Chamberie, the se^te of the Duke when he
sojourneth in these parts. Grimston.
It is seated in a pleasant Valley among the mountains, and is full of neat
ho^^es belonging to the Gentry of this Province. It is now fortified with a
strong Castle, and some out-workes, though not yet fully recovered of the
damage it received, when it was taken by Henry 4th, in the wars against this
Duke, Anno 1600. 2 Tarantaise, which commands the passage unto Italy, through
the hills called Geneura. 3 Bramont* 4 Aquebelle, situate at the foot of a huge
rock. 5 Carboneirs, and 6 Maurienne, which gave the first title to the Princes
of Saxony, called afterward Earls of Savoy. Here are also the two strong
Forts of Mount Melian, and Saint Katharines: the first of which held out four
months against many thousand shot of forty French Canons, Ao 1600. The lat^er
is the Fort, whose government being den^ed to Byron, plunged him in the
irrecouerable g^lp^ of discontented treasons.

On the Northeast of Savoy is the Country of Bresse, the chief Towns whereof
are 1 Chat^^ion. 2 Mon Real, and 3 Bourge, a town so well seated and
fortified, that it is not much inferior to the invincible Fortresses of Saint
Catharines and Mount Melian. Hist. of Fr.
The government of this town was also greedily sought by Byron; but it being
suspected that be held intelligence with the Duke of Savoy, it was also denied
him. It was of old called Forum Seracusianorum. This little Province was joined
to Savoy by the marriage of Isabel, daughter and heir to Vlic^e the l^st Lord
of it; with Amee the 4th of Savoy, Anno 1215: and was given by Duke Charles
Em^anuel, to Henry the 4th of France in exchange for the Marquisate of
Saluzzes; to which the French king pretended a title, Anno 1600.

The Marquisate of Saluzzes is sited in Peidmont, a part of Ita^y, being now
wholly under the Savoyen, and Mantuan Dukes: their latter possessing the
Marquisate of Monferrate only; the rest belonging to the Savoyard, whose
eldest son is entitled Prince of Pe^dmont.

This Peidmont called in Latin, Grimston.
Regio Pedemonta^a, (both names telling us that it is a country seated at the
foot of the Alps) is bounded on the East with Millaine, on the West with
Savoy, on the North with the Switzers, and on the South with the Mediterranean.
The Country is wonderful fertile if compared with Savoy, yet thought to be
some what inferior to the rest of Italy. It contains about 160 places
walled, and is so populous, that once a Peidemontane Gentleman being asked of
the extent of his Country, said, that it was a City 300 miles in compass. It
contains also besides Lordships, and Barronies; 50 Earledomes, and 15
Marquisates. It is divided (as we have said) between the Dukes of Savoy, and
Man^ua, the river Tener or Tanarus parting their possessions. The principal
towns belonging to the Savoyard are 1 Tu^in, called of old Augusta Taurinoru^,
because it was the mother town of the Tau^^^, who here dwelt, and from which
Taurini, the name of Turin ought rather to be derived, then (as some fancy)
from the river Duria, on whose banks it is built In this City is the Palace
and Court of the Duke of Savoy; Lewkno^.
the Sea of an Archbishop; and an University, wherein that renowned Scholar
Erasmus proceeded Doctor of Divinity. 2 Augusta Praetoria, vulgarly called
Aoste, situate in the Northern bound of this Countrie^ 3 Vorcelli a strong
town bordering on Millaine, to which it once belonged, and was given by Philip
Maria Duke of Millaine, unto Amadeus the third Duke of Savoy. It was the chief
town of the Libyci, who together with the Salassi and Taurini were the old
incola of this Country. 4 Inurea, called by Ptolomy, Eporedia. 3 Niza an haven
town seated on Varus. 6 Mondoni, or Montevicum. 7 Susa. 8 Saluzzes (which as
yet retains some affinity with the Salassi) a Marquisate and Bishops See.

The people in this Dukes Dominions are numbered 800000, of which 70000 are
Gentlemen.

We may read in Livy that Bitulto King of this Country (or the Allobroges) was
taken by Fabius Maximus; as also how Hannibal pacified a discord betwixt
Bruncus and his brother for the Diadem. This kingdom was overthrown by the
Romans, from them taken by the Burgundians, of whose kingdom, both when it was
absolute and under the Empire, this Country was a member, Paradine.
till the year 999. In this year Berald of Saxony, brother to Otho the third,
for killing Mary the lascivious wife of his Uncle, fled from Germany, and
settled himself here in France. His esonne Humbert (surnamed Blanchmanis, that
is, White-hand) was by the especial favor of the Emperor Conradus Salicus,
made Earl of Maurienne, which is a town of this Country, Ao 1027. The fourth
from this Humbert, being Ame the second, styled himself Earl of Savoy, 1109.
His successor Thomas 1210, and Peter (from his manif^ld conquests surnamed
Charlemaigne the Junior) Anno 1256, by conquest got Peidmont; to which the
Marquisate of Saluzzes containing almost all the rest, was united by a marriage
of the daughter of the Marquisate, to Charles Duke of Savoy, (for it was
erected into a ^^^^dome by Sigismund the Emperor, 1397.) Anno 1481. And though
he died without issue, yet his successors kept it till the French pretending
title to it, possessed themselves of it. It was again recovered by the
Savoyen, during the French civil wars, Anno 1588; and now is peaceably
possessed: The Country of Bress being given to the French for their pretention
to the Marquisate, Anno 1600. These Dukes of Savoy have a long time been
devoted to the Faction of Spain, especially since the French kings took in the
lesser States bordering on them, as Burgundy, Britain, etc. Charles the third
sided so constantly with the Emperor Charles the 5, the denying Fran^^s the
first, a passage for his army through his country, into Italy, he was by that
King despoiled of his Country, Anno 1536. The Emperor to recover it, left no
hing undone; but in vain: for the French encountering his For^es in the open
field, vanquished them with the slaughter of 15000 of his men. In the year
1558. peace being made between Henry and Philip, successors to those great
Princes: Emanuel Philibert, s^nne to Duke Charles, was restored to all his
Rights. The present Duke Charles Emanuel depends also much on the Spaniard,
(howeuer of late there have bin some jarres between them) ^is sons receiving
thence great pensions and honors. His second son D. Victorio, is knight of
Malta, Governor of the Kings galleys, and has 100000 Crowns per an^um. His
third son D. Amadeo, is made Cardinal, and has half the profits of the
Archbishopricke of Tolledo. His youngest son D. Thomazo has thence also a
liberal pension.

The order of the Annunciada was ordained by Amede duke of Savoy, Seldom.
at what time he defended Rhodes from the Turk, Ao 1409. Their Collar is of 15
linkes, to show the 15 mysteries of the Virgin; at the end is the portraiture
of our Lady, with the history of the Annunciation. Instead of a Motto, these
letters; F. E. R. T. id est, Fortitudo Eins Rhodum Tenuit, is engraven in every
place or link of the Collar; each link being interwouen one within the other,
in form of a true-louers knot. The number of the Knights is 14; the
solemnities are held annually on our Lady Day, in the castle of Saint Peter in
Turin. So from this victory; (for every repulse of the besieger, is a victory
to the besieged) there arose a double effect; first, the institution of this
order: secondly, the assumption of the present arms of this Duchy, which are
G, a cross A: This being the Cross of St John of Jerusalem, whose knights at
that time were owners of the Rhodes: Paradin^.
where as before the arms were Or, an Eagle displ^id with two heads Sable,
armed Gules; supporting in fesse, an eschotchion of Saxony; that is Barrwise
six pieces, Sable and Or, a Bend flowred Vert. A coat belonging to the German
Emperors of the house of Saxony, from whom the first Earls of Savoy are
extract. The revenues of this Duke, are a million of Crowns and better.

THE ALPS.
The natural mounds by which Germany and France are parted from Italy,
Plutarch.
are the ALPS, mountains which require five days to be ascended; they take
their name ab Albis nivibus being hills continually covered with snow, which
descends with a violencie, resembling the Cataracts of Nilus. Through these
hills Annibal made a way, with fire and vinegar, for the passage of his army
into Italy: whence it was said of him, viam aut inveniet Annibal, aut faciet.

They begin at Savona, and having run a good space, in a continued hill,
Boterus rel.
at last are divided into many parts, as Nigrasylva in Switzerland, and the
Hercynian wood about Bohemia. The ancient inhabitants were the Salij, Vacontij,
and Medull^, all vanquished by Caesar: the present by overmuch drinking of snow
water, are troubled with a swelling in the throat, or the Kings Evil, as we
use to call it; Quis tumidum guitur miratur in Alpibus?

Merula.
There are five passages over these hills into Italy, viz: three out of France,
and two out of Germany; the first from France is through Provence, and so close
upon the Tyrrhenian seas, through Liguria, which is the easiest, The second is
through the hills called Gen^ura, into the Marquisate of Saluzzes, and so to
Lombardic: this is the place through which the invincible Annibal traveled
with such difficulty; and through which also Charles the 8 marched toward
Naples. The third is over Mount Conis, through the country of Turin, which was
first hanselled (if we believe antiquity) by Hercules. From the passage of
these captains, were these latter hills called Alps Graiae* and the former
Alps Penninae, or more truly Paeninae from the Paeni, or Carthaginians. The
first way out of Germany into Italy, is through the Country of the Grisons, by
the Town of Veltlyn; which the Spaniard has seized into his hands: so that by
the keeping of this Veltlyn, or Valtolin, and manning of the Fort Fuentes,
which he also erected; he is in a manner the Lord of this passage, not only to
the discontent of the Natives, but to the distaste of his neighbors the
Savoyards and Venetians. The other way out of Germany into Italy, is through
the County of Tirolis, by the towns of Inspruch and Trent. This passage is
commanded by the Castle and Fort of Eresberge, seated on the confines of this
Country toward Suevia, and from Inspruch is two days journey distant. This
Fort in the war which the Protestant Princes made against Charles the 5, was
surprised by Captain Schertelin, so to hinder the coming of the Popes Forces
into Germany: for which the Emperor so hated him, that when all the rest of
the faction were pardoned, he only continued a Proscript, his head being valued
at 4000 Crowns. The taking also of this Fort, and the Castle adjoining, to D.
Maurice of Saxony* made the said Charles then being in Inspruch, fly out of
Germany.

OF ITALY.
ITALY is girded round with the Ionian, Maginus.
Tyrrhen^an, and Adriatique Seas, except it be toward France and Germany, from
which it is parted by the Alps.

The name impropriated to all the Region, is Italy, of Italus a King of Sicily,
which first taught the people agriculture; or from (...), which in Greek
signifies an Ox, whereof here is as much plenty, as use. The more particular
names are 1 H^speria, because it is situate under the Euening-star Hesperus.
And 2 Latium, because Saturn driven from Crete by his son Jupiter, hic latebat
abditus. 3 Ausonia. 4 Oen^tria, from its abundance of Wines.

Pliny beautifieth Italy with these attributes: Italia terrarum omnium alumna,
ead^m and parens, numine de^m electa, quae coelum ipsum clarius fa^eret, sparsa
congregaret Imperia, ritus mollire^; t^t populorum discordes l^nguas sermonis
commercio, ad colloquia distraheret; and humanitati hominem daret. Italy (says
he) the nurse and parent of all Regions, was elected by the providence of the
gods, to make (if it possible might be) the Heavens more famous; to gather the
scattered Empires of the world into one Body; to temper the barbarous rites of
the Nations; to unite so many disagreeing languages of men, by the benefit of
one common tongue* and in a word to restore man to his humanity.

The length of this famous Region is 1020 miles; the breadth in some places 410
miles, Maginus.
in others not above 126 miles; the whole compass is 3448 miles. It lies
under the 5 and 8 Climats, in the Northern temperat Zone; the longest day
being 16 hours. The people in former times were wary of behavior and
expenses; of great valor, as subduing the greatest part of the world; very
desirous of glory, as Cicero says, Semper appetentes gloriae praeter caeteras
gentes sunt Romani.

Here lived the famous Captains, Camillus the Sword, and 2 Fabius Maximus the
buckler of Rome. 3 Scipio. 4 Pompey, 5 Caesar, etc. The famous Orators Cicero,
Hortensius, and Antonius, etc. The worthy Historians, Livius, Tacitus, and
Salustius, etc. The memorable Poets, Virgill, Ovid, Catullus, Horatius, etc. In
these latter days Petrarch the Philosopher, Guicciardine the Historian,
Ariosto and Tasso the Poets, etc.

Brerewood.
The language of Italy was diverse, in Apulia they used the Mesapian tongue: In
Calabria the Greek: In Etruria the Thuscan; and in Latium the Latin, which
yet so altered in a little time, that Polybius says, that the Articles of
peace made between the Romans and the Carthaginians, could not be understood by
the best Antiquaries of his time. That the Latin tongue was generally spoken
in all the Provinces of the Roman Empire, as some hold, I dare not think; being
better persuaded by M. Brerewoods learned discourse on this Theme: Out of whom
I will only draw one of his main Arguments, viz: how it was by especial grace
granted to the Cuma^s, dwelling but 100 miles distant from Rome, publicly to
use the Roman language. This happened not 140 years before the Emperors, at
what time the Romans were Lords of all Italy, Sardinia, C^rsi^a, and the
greater part of Spain; And of this proof, Livy an Author above all exception,
is the ground.

This Country is said to be first inhabited by Ianus Ann. M. 1925. His Progeny
multiplied exceedingly, and peopled Italy with the Tribes of the Laurentini,
Brutij, Samniti, Etrusci, Sabini, Tarentini, etc. The second that came to enjoy
the happiness of this Country was Evander, and certain other Arcadi^ns, who
banished their native habitations, seated themselves about the place where Rome
was after built. The next that settled themselves here, was Aeneas and his
Trojans; who flying from their ruined country, and enraged enemies, and
seeking new habitations, were by tempest first cast on the shore of Africa.
There they were (as Virgil has it) entertained by Dido, then busy in the
building of Carthage; who so much doted on the perfections of this new commer,
that she yielded her body and City to his disposal. But this being not the
place where Aeneas posterity was to erect a fourth Monarchy, he privately
stole thence nto Italy, whereupon the discontented Lady slew her self. This
relation h^th no affinity at all with the truth of Chronology. For Carthage
being built but 135 years (or as others will, 143 years) before Rome; and
there being no less then 426 ye^res, between the beginning of the reign of
Aeneas in Italy, and the beginning of the reign of Romulus in Rome; it is not
possible that ever Dido should see Aeneas, unless in imagination or pictures.
Hereunto consents Ausonius, who honoring the Statua of this abused
Princess, with an Epigram of 18 verses, among others gives us these 4. Invida
cur in me stimul^sti Musa Maronem,
Fi^geret vt ^^strae da^na pudicitiae?
Vos magis his^ ^icis (^ectores) red te de me:
Quam qui furta d^um, concubitusque canunt.
Why did thou stir up Virgil envious Muse.
Falsely my name and honor to abuse?
Of me let histories be heard; not those
Which Jove's adulteries and thefts expose.
Credible it is that Aeneas being driven on the coast of Afric, was by some
Prince there courteously entertained, as a man whose same had been his
harbinger: but why the story should fasten it on Dido, I see not. Perhaps the
unfortunate death of this Queen, who laid violent hands on her self, gave
occasion to the Poet to feign that it was for the love of Aeneas; whereas it
was indeed to avoid the lust and fury of Iarbas, a potent king in Afric, who
violently desired to have his pleasure on her. Whether Aeneas ever were in
Afric or not; or who it was that welcomed him thither, it matters not:
certain it is, that in Italy he arrived in an happy hour. For he was no sooner
landed then gently entertained by Latinus King of the Laurentini; who to make
his love more apparent, espowsed his only child Lavinia unto him. Hence grew
the wars between Turnus K. of the Rutili a former suitor, and him; which
being extinguished by the death and vanquishment of the Rutilian, confirmed the
Trojans in a settled peace. For now growing with the Laurentini, by many
intermarriages, into a more constant bond of friendship; they built the Town
called after the name of their Queen, Lavinia; making it their residence for
their Princes, till Longa Alba was built by Alba Silvius, a succeeding King,
and made the chief of the kingdom.

and clapped his daughter Rhea into the Temple of Vesta; where she being a
mother to two boys, was (according to the custom) buried quick, and her
ch^ldren cast out for a prey for the wild beasts. They were found by Faustulus
the kings shepherd, nursed by his wife for her meretricious life named Lupa:
and being at last well grown; slew Amulius, and restored Numitor to his
kingdom, whom also they slew not long after. Then Romulus laid the foundation
of Rome, and tempered the mortar with the blood of his brother Rhemus, who
disdainefully had leapt over the new walls. This Town was peopled with the
refuse of the Italian Rascality, insomuch as their neighbors refused to give
them their daughters in marriage; till at solemn Plays and Pastimes the
Romans rau^shed the Sabine women, which came thither to behold the sport.
Diverse other nations or tribes rather of the Tuscanes suf^ered in this rape,
together with the Sabines: as the Ceninenses, the Antemnates, and the
Crustumini. Of these the Ceninenses were most eager of revenge, and under the
conduct of then King Acron, give battle to the Romans. Romulus seeing his
people gave ground* prayed unto Jupiter for the victory; and vowed if he
overcame king Acron, to offer up his armor unto him. When Acron the^ was
vanquished, Romulus cutting down a fair young Oak, hung on it all the armor
of Acron: Then girding his gown unto him, and putting on a garland of Laurel,
he laid the Oak on his shoulder, and marched into the city: his Army
^ollowing, and singing a royal song of victory. Hither must we refe^re the
begin^ing of Triumphs: but Nihil est mumtum and p^rfectu^ eodem tempore.
Taerquiniu^ Priscus long after Romulus, added hereunto the purple roabes; and
the triumphant Chariot, drawn with four horses. Of these Triumps are two
sorts; the greater properly so called, and the lesser vulgarly called the
Ovation; which differed in many circumstances. For 1 the Triumpher enters in a
royal Chariot, and is met by the Senators in their ornaments: but the Ovator
enters on foot, and is met only by the Knights and Gentlemen of Rome. 2^, The
Triumpher had a Laurel Crown, and entered with the noise of Drums and
Trumpets: but the Ovator, a Garland of Fur, with Flutes and Hoboyes playing
before him. 3^. The Triumpher was attired in a garment of state; the O^a^or in
a plain purple gown only. 4ly, In a Triumph the Soldiers cried out Io
triumph: in an Ovation they cried only O, O, O; the often doubling of which
noise made it be called (as some think) Ovation. 5ly, and lastly, the
Triumpher used in his sacrifice to offer a certain number of Oxen: but the
Ovator only offered a sheep; whence the name is more properly to be derived.
Now Ovation was in three cases granted. 1 If the General had subdued his
enemies with little or no bloodshed, so that there were not slain 5000 men; or
by persuasion more then battle. 2ly, If the wars had been flight, cursory,
or not lawfully managed. And 3ly, if it had been against an ignoble enemy. Of
this last we have a fair instance in P. Rupilio, who being Victor in the
Servile war (or the war wherein the bondslaues made head against the R^mans)
was contented with the Ovation, Ne triumphi dignitatem (says Florus) seruili
inscriptione violare^. The greater Triumphs were indeed full of magnificence:
the state whereof, who list to see, may find it fully set down by Plutarch,
in the Tr^mph of Paulus Aemylius. Yet by this which we have said by way of
Antithesis, not a little may be observed. This greater triumph was
notwithstanding, not always given to such as deserved it; there being many
ways to hinder, or forfeit it. 1 Sometimes it was denied a Conqueror by the
strength of a contrary faction: so Pompey denied Metellus his Triumph for the
conquest of Crete. 2l, Sometimes it was by the Conquerours omi^ted for fear of
envy: so Marcellus in Plutarch, after his conquest of Sicilae, having twice
before triumphed; denied it the third time: his reason was (...), Invidiam
parit tertius triumphus. ^l, Sometimes the Soldiers having been ill paid, or
too much straightened; would not permit their General to triumph: and this was
P. Aemylius case, because he divided not among the men of war (according to
his promise) the spoils of Greece. 4ly, Sometimes because the General had
borne no public office in the City: so (in Livie) Lentulus returning
Proconsull out of Spain required a Triumph: to which the fathers answered,
that he had indeed done things worthy that honor, but they had no president
for it; Vt qui neque Consul, neque Dictator; neque Praetor res gessisset,
triumphaxet. 5ly, Sometimes the Generals themselves omitted it, for the
furtherance of some of their other designs: So Caesar coming toward Rome in
Triumph, the same time the Consulls were chosen; quitted his Triumph to sue for
the Consulship: it being the custom that such as demanded the Triumph should
abide without the City, and such as sued for the Consulship must of necessity
be within. 6ly, It was denied when the war had been undertaken without the
command of the Senate: So it happened to Manlius, having to the great enlargement
of the Empire; yet without commission surprised Gallatia; quia causam belli
Senatus non approbauit. 7ly, If the wars had been civil between the Romans
themselves, there was no Triumph allowed to the Victor; because in all such
victories the Commonwealth was deprived of some part of her self: So Pompey
and Metellus having vanquished Sertorius in Spain; Externum magis id bellum
quam civil videri voluerunt vt triumpharent. 8ly, If the conquest had been
gotten not without great loss on the Romans side: For this was Valerius
conqueror of the Gau^es denied this honor; Quia magis dolor ciuibus amissis,
quam gandium fusis hostibus praevaluit (says Macrobius) 9l^, and lastly, if
the service had not been performed in the Generals own Province: So when
Livius and Nero being Consuls* overcame Hasdrubal, Livins only triumphed
because the war had been managed in his Province; whereas indeed Nero was
the man that won the day. And these are all, or at least the chief causes of
hindering or omitting this honor: which certainly was the most eminent that ever
the free state was capable of. When the Commonwealth was changed into a
Monarchy, this honor seemed too great for Subjects; and was first of all
neglected by M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the establisher of Augustus Empire: who
having quenched certain rebellions in Asia, and settled ^he Province, had a
Triumph decreed for him; which he, to give posterity example, de^ied. This
example, being as it were a law to others, was the cause that this custom was
laid aside: and no man under the degree of an Emperor triumphed; p^iu^te
Captains being from thence forth contented with the triumphall ornaments,
(...), are the words of Dion. Yet I find that almost 600 years after this,
Be^isa^ius triumphed: but I answer, that this was done in Constantinople, not
Rome; and 2ly, it lacked so much of a triumph, that it fell short of an
Ovation: it being indeed nothing but an honorable presenting of himself, and
his prisoners before the Emperor. And if after Agrippa, Bellisarius may be
accounted to have triumphed: certainly, himself excepted, there was none ^ther
to whom this favor was vouchsafed; neither after him any at all. The last
Emperor whom we find in Histories to have triumphed was Probus, after his
victories over the Germans: and the Blemyi a people of Afric, about the year
284. But I have been too tedious in this discourse. I return unto Romulus,
who having vanquished the Ceninenses, and made peace with the Sabines, reigned
victoriously in his new City the space of 37 years.

was together with all his kind^ed banished the Town, A M ^457. The people for
his sake ever after loathed the name of a King, and therefore the City was
governed by two Consulls, annually chosen out of the chief Citizens, called
Patricij. These Consuls took their name a consulendo, ^om counselling of and
seeing to the good of the people and Commonwealth, Floru^.
Vt consulere se suis ciuibus debere meminisse^t; their name being a memo^^all
of their charge. This magistracy of the Consuls h^ld not long, but that first
the Decemviri, then Tri^unes of consular auth^^ity, and others dispossessed
them of their government; concerning which thus Tacitus. Vrbem Romam a principio
reges* etc. The City of Rome was in the beginning governed by Kings: Liberty
and the Consulship L. Brutus brought in The Dictators were chosen but for a
time: the D^^^mviri passed not two years: neither had the Consularie authority
of the Tribunes of the Soldiers any long continuance: Nor Cinna, nor Syllas
dominion Pompey and Crass^s quickly yielded to Caesar's forces; Lepidus and
Antony to Augustus: this Tacitus. Yet notwithstanding these often mutations,
the Con^uls were generally the supreme Magistrates, in which office t^ere were
always two, and those but for a year, ne vel solitudine vel mo^a potestas
corrum^eretur. And though some had the fortune to be Consulls two or three
years together, yet every n^w year they were anew chosen, and so the^r
offices reck^^ed as several: neither do we find any to have been elected
for less then a^ year, unless upon the death, or deposition of a ^ormer,
until the civil wars* But then cum belli ciuilis pr^mia f^stinari
coeperu^t, Tacitus.
when the services done in the civil wars ^equi^ed a qui^ker turn in
requital, the Consulshippe was given only for some part of the year, and
ordinarily for two months: ^h first Consul* being named Ordinarij in whose
names the writings made for the whole year were dated; Dion.
the other Minores* or Ilonorarij, which only served to make up a numbe^. For
so ambitious were he Romans of this honor, that when Maximus died in the l^st
^ay of his Consu^ship, Caninius R^bi^u^ petitioned Caesar for that part of the
day that re^ained: whence tha^ so memorated ^est of Tully, O vigilantem
Consulem, qui toto ^onsulatu^ suitempore s^mnum oculis non vidit Also when
^aecin^ was by the S^nate degraded f^o^ this honor, the day in which he was to
resign it, one Ros^ius Regulus obtained the office from Vitellius for the day
remaining, Ta^itus.
but as the Historian notes, magno cum risu accipientis, tribuentisque. Now as
the Romans did thus exceed the first number of Consulls, so sometimes fell they
short of it. The first that was sole Consul was Pompey in the beginning of the
civil wars, viz. Ao V.C. 703. The next, Calvisius.
one Varianes Ao Cti 410. This authority from the first institution to the
final period of it, continued at least in name (for the Emperors, long before
the end of it, assumed the prerogative) the space of 1084 years: howbeit not
without many intermissions of the title and office, by the several forms of
government above specified. The last Consul was one Basilius in the reign of
Justinian, Anno 541. The first were two worthy men, namely Collatinus, husband
to Lucretia; and Iuniu^ Brutus, who in the reign of the Tarquines
counterfeited a distracted humor, but being called to this dignity, by the
execution of his son, for practicing secretly with the Tarquins, kept the
licentious people within the bounds of true obedience. The people free from
fear of the Kings, for want of employment at home, ouerburdened their
neighbors abroad, whom after the space of 500 years they subdued: a matter
truly worth consideration, that the Italians should hold out against the
puissance of Rome 500 years, when as almost all the rest of the world was
subdued in little more then 200. So great a matter was it (says Florus) to
contract the many bodies of Italy under one head.
Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem.
So great a matter was it found,
To raise Romes Empire from the ground.
After Italy was subdued, Pyrrhus of Epirus was beaten home by them; and next
the overthrow of the Carthaginians cast many fair possessions into the lap of
Rome: who now become the mistrisse of the world, grew likewise oppressed by her
own greatness; and therefore willing to be supported. This advantage Caesar
espying, like an officious Gentleman Usher laid hold of her arms, and from her
servant became her master; first with the title of perpetual Dictator, and
next of absolute Emperor: and after he had ruled five years, was with 23
wounds murdered by Brutus, Cassius, and their ^ellow conspiratours, in the
Senate house. Yet was not Caesar the first man that ever taught the Romans to
obey, they had already learned that lesson, and he had good Schoolemasters
which foregoing him, did instruct him in the arts of Empire and ambition.
Concerning which deg^^es of the Romans falling into bondage, take along with
you this short Epi^ome, as I find it in Tacitus: Nam rebus modicis (...) as
facile habebatur* etc. For whiles our dominions were straight, equality was
easily maintained: but after we had subdued the world, destroyed all Cities
or Kings which stood in our light, or might work our annoyance; whenas we had
leisure to seek after wealth void of peril; there arose hot contentions
between the Nobility and Commons: sometimes factious Tribunes carried it away;
sometimes the Consulls prevailed: and in the City and common Forum, some
little skirmish^^, the beginnings of our civil wars, were attempted. Anon
after C. Marius one of the meanest of the communalty, and L. Sylla the most
cruel of all the nobility, by force of arms overthrowing the free state,
induced an absolute government. After these succeeded Cn. Pompeius, something
secreter but nothing better, and nunquam postea nisi de principatu quaesitum,
and then was there never any other question debated, but who should be
so^eraigne Prince of the state. So far Tacitus. Caesar being thus ^^aine,
they recovered some hope and show of liberty, till first the confederacy, and
secondly the falling out of Augustus. Anto^ius, and Lepidus, put all again out
of joint. For these civil wars once ended; by the death of Antonie, and
degrading of L^pidus, Augustus took all into his own hands: cuncta discordijs
civilibus fessa, nomine principis sub imperium accepit. The Emperors,
notwithstanding this foundation laid by August^s, came not to the height of
their authority, nor the people to the bottom of their slavery, till some
hundred of years after: ^n which times the Emperors by degrees incroaching on
the common liberty and privileges; and the people ( homines ad servitutem
parati, as Tiberius called them) desirous to gratify and become gracious with
the Prince; they lost in the end not only the body, but the carcass and very
shaddowe of the free state or Commonwealth. The chief strength by which the
ensuing Emperors subsisted, was the Praetorian guard, consisting of 10000 men,
Dion.
every one having the double wages of a Legionary Soldier. This gua^d Augustus
first took to himself, under pretense of his own safety; but intending only
by so choice a band of followers to awe the City: and they knowing from whom
their maintenance was to be derived, would never ^ndu^e to hear of the free
state. An evident example whereof we have in story: for when after the death of
Caligula, the Senate had ^o great hopes of recovering their liberty, that they
gave the watch word to the city guard; and consulted about the set^^g of the
Commonwealth in open counsel: the Praetorian Soldiers saluted Claudius
Emperor, and compelled the Senators to approve their election. Over this body
of the guard were ordained two Praefect^ Praetorio, both which took place next
the Emperor himself, Zosimus.
until the time of Constantine: who first cassing the Praetorian order, and
destroying their Camp, because they were commonly the authors of all the
seditions and rebellions in the state; and afterward constituting four
Prefects (in title but not authority) for the four quarters of his Empire; he
gave the chief precedence to the Patricij, an honor of his own invention.
But I return to the Emperors.

310 43 Constantinus M. 31. This Emperor though very religious, as being the
first Christian Emperor, did more prejudice the Empire then any of his
predecessors, first in translating the Imperial seat from Rome to Bizantium,
by which transplantation the Empire lost much of its natural vigor; as we see
in Plants and Flowers, who being removed from the place of their first grow^h,
loose much of that virtue which was formerly in them* On this reason Camill^^
would not suffer the R^mans to remove their seat to Veij* then newly conquered,
but to prevent their desires, set fire on the town and so consumed it, Vt nunc
V^^os fuisse (says Florus) lalora Annalium fides. A second fault of this
Constantine was the dividing of the Empire between his children For though it
was quickly again reunited, yet by his example others learned the same lesson,
renting the Empire in pieces, which occasioned the loss of the whole. The
former Emperors used indeed to associate sometimes their sons or brothers
with them; yet so, that they were jointly Lords of it, as of one entire
regiment: but Constantine, if I remember aright, was the first which allotted
to particular men, particular jurisdiction. The third fault of this Prince, was
his translating the Legions and Colonies which lay on the north Marches, into
the eastern country, as a Bulwark against the Persians: thereby opening that
passage, by which not long after the barbarous nations entered. For though
instead of these Colonies, he planted Garrisons and Forts, yet th^se quickly
sailed, and became in a manner unserviceable. So that Zosimus (though in other
of his reports concerning this Prince he bewrayes much malice) truly calls
him the first subverter of that flourishing Monarchy. To these three causes
may be added a fourth, concerning the Emperors in general, namely their
stupid negligence, and degenerate spirits. Italy notwithstanding continued a
member of the Empire till the year 399, in which Theodosius the great divided
again the Empire: Munster.
to Arcadi^^ his elder son he gave the Eastern; to Honorius the young^^ the

During the reigns of these Emperors and some few years after, Italy was
seven times almost brought to desolation, by the fire and sword of Barbarous
nations. Hist. of Ital.

king of the Heruli, who drove Augustulus out of Italy, and twice in 13 years
laid the country desolate. 6ly, By Theodoricus king of the Goths, called by
Zeno the Emperor to expel Odoacer. 7ly, By Gunde^^^^^ king of the Burgundians,
who having ransacked all Lombardie, returned home, leaving the Goths in
possession of Italy: who after they had reigned 72 years in Italy, were at
last subdued by Belisarius, and Narses, two of the brauest Captains that ever
served the Roman Emperors. This Narses governed Italy for the Emperor 17
years, Pezelius in Sleidan.
at the end of which time being basely vpbraided by Sophia the
Constantinopolitan Empress, and wise to Justinian the Emperor: who envying
his fortune, procured him to be recalled, and sent him word, she would make
the Eunuch (for such he was) come home and spin among her maids: he replied,
that he would spin such a web, as neither she, nor the best of her minions
should ever unweave. Thereupon he sent into Pannoia (now Hungary) for King
Albe^nus and his Lombards; who coming into Italy with their (...) and
children* possessed themselves of all the Country, from the Alps to the
Appennine Hills, calling it by their own name L^mbardie.

Match. hist. of Flor.
Of all these kings of Lombardie, I will only relate some occurrences of the two
first and the two last. Alb^inus before his coming into Italy, waged wa^re
with C^^emu^dus a king of the Iopidi whom he overthrew, and of his ^kul he made
a ^uaffing cup. Rosamund daughter to this king be took to wife, and one day
being ouer-merry in Verona, compelled her to drink out of her fathers skull.
This abuse she sto^ asking, prom^sed to one Helmichil^e her self to wise, and
Lombardie for a dowry, if he would kill the King. He consented, and did it; but
was so extremely hated for it, that he was forced together with ^s Rosamund to
fly to Rauenna the Court of Longi^us the ^xarch. Longinus partly desirous to
enjoy the love of Rosamund^; partly to possess that mass of money and jewels
which she brought with her; and partly by her faction to raise a beneficial
war against the Lombards; persuaded her to kill Helmichilde, and take him, to
which she agreed. Helmich^^d entering out of a Bath called for beer, and she
gave him a strong poison; half of which when he had drank, mistrusting the
matter, he made her drink the rest, and so they both died together. C^^thes
the 2d king extended the Longobardian kingdom, even to the gates of Rome. He
was so cruel, that after his death they would have no more kings, but choose 30
Dukes to gou^^^^ them. This division (though it en^ured not fully a dozen
years) was the cause that the Lombards made not themselves Lo^^^ of all Ita^y.
Th 21 King was Astu^phus, who won Rave^^, and the Exarchie thereof, A0 741.
the last Ex^rch being (...) Eutic^us. Astu^phus long enjoyed not his conquests;
for Pepin king of France, being by Pope ^tepha^ the (...), solicited to come
into Italy, ouerthrewe him, and gave Ravenna to the Church. The last king was
D^sideriu^, who falling at ods with Adrian the first, and besie^ing him in
Rome, was by Charles the great, successor to Pepin, bes^eged in (...), and
himself with all his children taken prisoners, A0 774. Here ended the kingdom
of the Lombards, having endured in Italy 232 years. Lombardy was then made a
Province of the French, and after of the Germans Empire; many of whose
Emperors used to be crowned kings of Lombardie by the Bishops of Millaine,
with an iron Crown, which was kept at M^doccum, now called Mon^^ a small
Village. This Charles confirmed his fathers former donation, to the Church; and
added of his own accord, Marca Anconitana, and the Dukedom of Spoleto. For
these and other kindnesses, Charles was by Pope Leo the 4th on Christmas day
made Emperor of the West, Ao 801. whose successors shall be catal^guized when
we come to describe Germa^^^. Boterus*
At this division of the Empire, Irene was Empress of the Eas^; to whom and
her successors Naples was allotted* it being then in the possession of the
Greeks. To the Popes were given by this Emperor and his father, almost all
the lands which they possess at this day. The Venetians in that little they
then had, remained sui^^ris. The rest of Italy containing all Lombarde,
P^dmont, Frinly, Tuscany, and Trenigiana, belonged to the Empire; till the
Imperial reputation dec^ying, gave the petty Princes occasion of strengthening
themselves; incited particular Cities to make themselves free commonwealths.

Of Italy as it now is.
The soil as in former times is so fruitful, that they have abundance of all
things, and want of none; transporting into other places Rice, Silks, Velvets,
Satins, T^ffaties, Grogrammes, Rash, Fustians, Gold, Wire, Armor, Allom,
Glasses, etc. They have their three Haruests in one year, which require as
much labor of the husbandman, as it yields profit to the Lord: so that it is
truly said, that the rich men of Italy, were the richest; and the poor, the
poorest in the whole world.

The language is very courtly and fluent, the best whereof i^ about Florence
and Siena: it retains the greatest portion of Latin, but not without the
mixture of barbarous languages, so long in use amongst them.

The chief Rivers generally of the whole Region are Padus, Maginus,
or Poe, called also Eridanus, into which Phaeton was drenched when he came
down tumbling from heaven: this river rises in the Alps, and running through
Lombardie, divides the country in Cispadanam, and Transpidan^m, a division in
these days forgotten; and so gallopeth with a fail carecre into the
Adriatique. 2 Rubi^on the ancient Northern bound of Italy.

3 Cuique fuit roru^ promiss^ potentia Tibris.
And Tiber unto which was given
Lordship of all things under heaven.
Sands relat.
The people are for the most pa^^ grave, respective, and in^enious; excellent
men (said a Spaniolized Italian) but for three things; 1 in their lusts they
are unnatural, 2 in their malice unappeasable: 3, in their actions deceitful.
To which might be added, they will blaspheame sooner then sweat, and murder
a man rather then slander him. They are exceeding i^alous over their wives,
insomuch that they shut them up from the common view, and perm^t them to
discourse with few or none. The l^cke which a Gentleman of V^^^e used to keep
his wife true in his absence, is so common, it needs no relation. Indeed this
^^nzie rages among all Southern people. The Tu^kes permit not their women to
walk in the streets, but covered with a v^yl^. In Barbary it is death for any
man to see one of the Xer^^^^ Concubines; and for them too, if when they see a
man, though but through a casement, they do not suddenly skreeke out. The
Spanish Ambassador Mendoza, B^din de rep
found great fault with our promiscuous sitting of men and women in the Church,
a^^^^ting it as immodest and lascivious. To whom D' Dale, master of the
Requests, replied, that indeed in Spain, where the people even at the Divine
Service, could not abstain from unclean thoughts, and unchaste gestures, that
mi^gled kind of sitting was not allowable; but Englishmen were of another
temper. ^ew Northern people are troubled with this yellow Iaundise; who not
only sit mixed in the Church, but even in the open and common Bathes also. Two
things which the Italian would hardly endure, who so infinitely are beso^^ed
with this passion, that look how many Italians there are, there are for the
most part so many ^aylors. The women are generally witty in speech* modest in
outward carriage, and bountiful where they bea^e affection: and it is
prove^bially said, that they are Mag-pier at the docre, Saints in the Church,
Goats in the Garden, Dinells in the house, Angels in the streets, and Sirens
in the windows. All the people both men and women amount to 15 Millions.

The usual division is into six parts, 1 Lombardy. 2. Tuscany. 3 the land of
the Church. 4 Naples. 5 Rieue^ere di Genon. 6 the land of Venice; of which
there is passed this censure, according to the capital Ci^ties. 1 Rome for
Religion. 2 Naples for Nobility. 3 Mollaine for Beauty. 4 G^noa for
stateliness. 5 Florence for policy. 6 Venice for Riches. Howsoever we will
divide it according to the present diverse principalities which are, Lither The
greater, as The Kingdom of Naples. The Papacy. The Commonwealth of Venice.
The Dukedom of Florence. The Dukedom of M^llaine.
Lither The lesser, as The Dukedom of Mantua. The Dukedom of Vrbine. The
Principality of Parma. The State of Genoa. The State of Luca.



THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES.
THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES is separated from the Land of the Church by a line
drawn from the mouth of the river Tronto, Orteli*
to the head of Axosenus: On the other parts it is envi^oned with the Sea, the
compass of it being 1468 miles. This Kingdom is the fertil^st place in all
Italy, abounding in Miner of diverse m^^^als; and the choicest wi^es called Vina
Massier, and Fal^ru^: To Alexandria they s^nd Saffrons, to (...) S^^kes, to
Venice oil, to Rome Wines.

The Noblemen here, of all men under Heaven, live in most carelessness, having
like the Tyrant Polycrates, nothing to trouble them, but that they are troubled
with nothing, bu^ the Pe^^^t ^^eth in as great a misery, as his Lord in jollity.

The principal rivers of this Kingdom of Naples are 1 Sil^^^^, 2 Basentus, 3
Posoa^a, 4. Trontus, 5 Sal^^elius, 6 V^^^nus, 7 Salinus, and 8 Gariglian. On
the banks of this last river, Guice
many battles have bin fought between the French and the Spaniards for the
Kingdom of Naples: especially that famous battle between the Marquess of
Saluzzes, General of the French, and Goasalvo Leader of the Spaniards; the
loss of which victory by the French, was the absolute confirmation of the
Realm of Naple^ to the Spaniards. More famous is this river for the death of
Peter di Medices, who being banished his Country at the coming of king Charles
into Italy; and having diverse times in vain attempted to be reimpatriate;
followed the French army hither; and after the loss of the day, took ship
with others here, to fly to Caieta; but ouer-charging the vessel, she sunk and
drowned them all. But most famous is it, in that Marius, that excellent, though
unfortunate captain, being by Syllas faction, Plutarch.
driven out of Rome, hid himself stark naked in the dirt and weeds of this
river; strange alteration. He had not lien here long, but Syllas soldiers
found him, and carried him to the city of the Mintu nians, being fast by this
river. The^e men to please Sylla, hired a Cimber to kill him, which the fellow
attempting (such is the virtue of Majesty even in a miserable fortune) run out
again crying, he could not kill C. Marius. This river was of old called Aquae
Sinessuanae, or the Lake of Minturne.

The chief Provinces are
1. TERRA DI LAVORO. aunciently Campania, and called Veneris and
Bacchicer^amen, the chief Cities whereof are 1 Caieta, so called either of
Caieta the nurse of Aeneas here buried; or from (...), vro, because the Trojan
Ladies being here arri^ed out of Africa, and fearing their husbands would again
put out to sea, burnt their ships, and so forced them to settle in this
country. It is a Town commodiously seated on the sea side, and seems to be a
place of great importance, insomuch that (as C^minaeus tells us) if King
Charles the 8th, had but only fortified it, Adrianus.
and the castle of Naples, the Realm had never bin lost* 2 Naples, the
Metropolis of the Kingdom, a beautiful City, containing seven miles in
compass. It was once called Parthenope, and falling to ruin, was new built,
and called Neapolis. Among all other things here is an hospital, the revenues
whereof is 60000 Crowns; wherewith besides other good deeds they nourish in
diverse parts of the Kingdom 2000 poor Infants. In this City the disease
called Morbus Gallicus, or Neapolitanus was first known in Christendom. This
City is seated on the sea shore, and fortified with 4 strong Castles, viz: 1
Castle Capo^na, where the Kings palace was: 2 Saint Ermo; 3 Castle del Ovo, or
the Castle of the Egg; and fourthly Castle Novo, or the new Castle. Floru^.
3 Capua, whose pleasures enervated the victorious army of Hannibal whence was
the saying, Capua est Cann^ A^nibali. 4 Cuma, ^eere which is Sybillae antrum,
by which Aeneas went down to H^ll to talk with his Father: and not far d^stant
is the Lake called lacus Avernus; the stink of which kills birds as they fly
over it. 5 Baiae famous for the Bathes. 6 Nola, where Marcellus overthrew
Hannibal, and his souldi^^^; letting the world know that Hannibal was not
invincible. 7 Pa^colis a small town standing on a creek of the sea opposite to
B^aile, Dion.
from which it is distant 3 miles and a half. These towns are famous for the
bridge built between them by C. Caligul^. It was composed of sund^y vessels,
compacted together in that sort, that there was not only a fair and large
passage, but di^ers ten^s and victualing houses on both sides. Caius in
triumphall ha^it marches and remarcheth over the bridge, praises himself and
his soldiers, as men to whose heroic enterprise^ neither Earth nor Sea was an
obstacle. This he did, as himself a^^irmed, to keep in awe Neptun^; and to
exceed the like acts of Xerx^s and Darius, memorized in old Histories: or as it
was coniectured to terrify the Romans and Britains, which (...) of such a
notable exploit: or to fulfill the prophecy of (...), who had often foretold
during the life of Tiberius, that it was as impossible for Canis to succeed ^n
the Empire, as to ride o^ horseback from Baule to Putcolis. 8 Misenum, where
Augustus keeping one A^mada, and another at Raven^a, (...) the whole Roman
Empire H^r^ is also in this Country the (...) Velu^^^s, that casts out fl^mes
of fire: the smoke of whi^^ ^led ^liny Junior, coveting to search the cause of
it The flame hereof br^ke ^orth cruelly also during the reign of Titus,
casting out not only such sto^e of smoke, that the ver^ Sun seemed to be in the
Eclipse: but also huge stones, and of ashes such plenty, that Rome, Afric,
Egypt, and Syria, were even covered; Hereulanum and P^mpeios, two Cities in
Italy, were overwhelmed with them. There were heard dismal no ses all about
the Province, and Giants of incredible bigness seen to stalk up and down, about
the top and edges of the mountain: which extraordinary accident, either was a
cause or presage of the future pestilence, which raged in Rome and Italy long
after.

4. ABRVZZO, where once the Samnita, Picentini, and others dwelt; the chief
towns are Aquila, ne^re the Appen^ne. 2 Beneventum once called Maleventum. 3
Aquino where Thomas Aquinas, the great School-Diuine was borne. 4. Salmo, Oui^s
birthplace, as himself testifies in his De Tristsbus, Sulmo mihi patria est
gelidis uberrimus undis,
Millia qui nonies distat ab urbe december.
Sulmo my birthplace full of rivers clear,
From Rome is distant ninety miles well near.


In this country are the straights called Furcae Candinae, wherein when the
Sam^ites and Picentini had so enclosed the Romans, Livy.
that there was no possibility of escape: they sent to Herennius, a man for his
age much reverenced, and for his wisdom much followed by them, to know what it
were best to do to the Romans. The old man sent word, they should all be sent
home safe and untouched. This answer not being well liked, they sent to him
again: he returned answer, they should all be put to the sword. These different
answers made them conceive amis^e of the old man's brain, till explain^ng
himself, he told the^ that either they must make the Romans their friends by a
(...) and honorable deliverance; or else take from them all power of doing
hurt, by putting to sword so many of their Captaine^ and Soldiers; mid way was
there none. To neither of these courses would the soldiers agree, but
disarming and spoiling the Romans, sent them home. The Romans not made friends
by so ^dious a be^efit, but hatching revenge for the disgrace, under the
conduct of Papyrius, entered again the country: which, having opprobriously
handled the natives, they made subject to the Senate and people of Rome:
Leaving Princes a notable lesson for their proceedings against men of quality
and rank, either not to strike at all, or else to strike home, and to the
purpose. M^ch^avel in his history of Florence, taxes for committing a great
^olo^cisme in state, R^naldo of the house of Alb^zi; in that hating Cosmo of
the Family of the Medici, he only procured his b^n^shment; which Cosmo at his
return recompensed to the full: Whereon the historian in^erreth this notable
Aphorism, That great personages must not at all be touched; or if they be,
must be made su^e from taking revenge. Yet do I not prohibit a Prince the use
of mercy, I know it is the richest Jewel that adorneth his Crown; neither
dare I take upon me to limit the use of so excellent a virtue: only let me
observe how many (...) of usage are commonly afforded those men, whose liberty
after their delinquencie, may endanger the safety of the Prince or State; I
find then three principal, whereof the first is immediate execution, a course
more to be allowed where it cannot, then commended where it may be spared. The
second is either close imprisonment, or else consiament to the house and
custody of some man in trust with the Prince; wherein great caution ought to be
used: for we find in our own histories, how Morton Bishop of Elie, being
committed to the Duke of Bucking^am his custody by Richard 3d, not only
procured his own liberty; but wrought the Duke to the contrary faction. The
last which is in all times the gentlest, and in some cases the surest, is not
only an absolute pardon of life, or a grant of liberty, (for that alone were
partly vnsa^e:) but an^ind^ering of the party delinquent by giving him some
place of honor, or committing to (...) fidelity some office of ^r^st. A
pregnant instance we have of this kind in the Emperor Otho, who not only
pardoned Marius Cel^us the chief of Gaelba's ^action; but put him in place
nearest about him, and made him one of his principal Leaders in the war
against Vitell^^; the reason was, ne hostis metum, (...), lest lying alo^se as
a pardoned enemy, he might suspect that the bre^ch were but badly made up. But
now it is (...) my self from the streights of these Furc^ Candinae, and to
^^lace my self in the plains of Calabria.

3. CALABRIA IMPERIOR, Adrianus.
the inhabitation of the Bru^ij, whose chief Cities are ^ Peste, or Pessidonia,
where Roses grow thrice in a year. 2 Salernum, famous for the study of
Physic, the Doctors whereof made the book Schola Salerus, dedicated to our
Henry 8th. 3 Consensia the prime City of these parts. 4 Rhezo, or Regium, so
called from (...), rumpo; because that here it is thought that Sicily was
broken from Italy. 5 Locris, where lived the Lawmaker Zaleucus, who ordering
adultery to be punished with the loss of both their eyes, was compelled to
execute his law on his son the first offender. Therefore to show the love of a
Father, and sincerity of a Judge, he put out one of his sons eyes, and one of
his own. He also provided in his Laws, that no woman should be attended with
more then one maid in the street, but when she was drunk; that she should not
go out of the City in the night, but when she went to commit adultery: that
she should not wear gold or embroydered apparel, but when she purposed to be a
common strumpet: that men should not wear rings and tissues, but when they
went a-whoring and the like: by which laws both men and women were restrained
from all extraordinary trains of attendants, and excess of apparel; this
last, asault in our times too common. This town was formerly also famous for
the victory of Eunomus, an excellent Musician; upon Aristonus of Rhegium, an
other of the same profession. For though Aristonus had made his prayers to
Apollo, the god of Music, to grant him the conquest; yet Eunomus plainly told
him, that nature was against him; who had made all the Grasse-hoppers on his
side of the water, mute. The day being come, one of the strings of Eunomus
harp in the midst of his playing, brake; when presently a Grassehopper leaped
upon his harp, and supplied the defect of his string, by which means the
victory was adjudged to Eunomus. And indeed it is by diverse affirmed, that
between Locris and Rhezo i^ the inner of Al^x, on the banks of which, toward
Locris, the Grassehoppers do sing merrily, on the other they are quite mute.

Strabo.
4. CALABRIA SVPERIOR, or Magna Graecia, from diverse Colonies of Graecians, that
there were planted. On the Northeast part of this Country is Golfo di Tarento,
olim Sinus Tarentinus, on the Southeast, Golfo de Chilaci, olim Sinus
Scillaticus. The chief towns are 1 Tarentum, a town built by the
Lacedaemonians, about which grew the wars between Pyrrbus and the Romans:
Strabo.
here the Philosopher Architas was borne, so famous for his flying Dove. 2
Crotona, the men whereof were so active, that at one Olympicke game, all seven
that overcame were Cretonians: their glory much decayed in a battle against
the Locrians, where 120000 of the^ were overcome by 15000 of the enemy. 3
Polycostrum. 4 Amycle, a town peopled with Pythagoreans. These men having bin
often terrified with a vain rumor of their enemies approach; promulgated a
law, forbidding all such reports: by which means their enemies coming
unawares upon them, took the town. Hence grew the proverb, Amyclas silentium
perdidit: and Lucilius commanded to be silent, made answer, Mihi necesse est
loqui, scio enim Amyclas silentio peri^sse. 5 Sybaris, a city built by the
Graecians, after the destruction of Troy, the people whereof were Lords of 25
cities, and could arm 30000 men. They were so effeminate and delicate, that
they permitted no smith or copper-man to dwell in their town, lest the noise of
the workers should disturb their rest. Fiddlers and singers they had in
request; which occasion the Cretonians their adversaries embracing, entered the
town, apparelled like Musicians, and mastred it. Before this accident, there
was a prophecy given, that the town should never be taken, till men were more
esteemed then gods. It happened that a servant being beaten by his master, and
for the gods sake obtaining no mercy, fled to the monument of his masters
Ancestors, and was pardoned. Amyris the Philosopher hearing this, forsook the
town; most men holding him mad, in a time of no danger to leave so delicious a
seat; hence grew the proverb, Amyris insaint, applied to such as under show of
madness, or folly, provide for their own safety. 6 St Severine.

5. TERRA DI OTRANTO, possessed heretofore by the Salentini and Iapyges: the
chief towns are 1 Brundusium, glorying in one of the best havens in the World.
2 Hydruntum, now called Otranto, Knolls.
the taking of which town by Mahomet the Great, Anno 1481, put all Italy in
such a fear, that Rome was quite forsaken; and not fully inhabited till the
expulsion of the Turks the year following. 3 Gallipolis.

6. PVGLIA, containing Apulia Daunia, and Apulia P^ucetia: the cities of which
are Manfredonia the seat of an Archbishop. 2 Canna famous for the great
victory of Hannibal against the Consuis, Paulus Aemylius, Terentius Varro, and
the Romans; of whom were slain 42700. Plutarch.
Had Hannibal pursued this victory, he had easily ouerthrown the Roman
Commonwealth; so that it was truly said unto him, by Maharball Captain of his
horsemen, Vincere scis Annibal, victoria uti nescis. Here stands Venusia,
whence Horase borne in this town is called Venusinus: as also 2 Arpinum where
Tully was borne; here moreover is the hill Gargalus, or mount St Angelo) 120
miles round. It is as well by Art as Nature, very defensible, so that it is
commonly the last place in Naples, which is abandoned, as we may see, in the
Greeks and Sarazens, who kept this hill many years after the Normans were
Lords of the rest of the Country. The greatest riches of this Province is the
tribute of cattle, Guiceiard.
which also is one of the fairest revenues in Naples, as being worth (in
Guicciardines time) 80000 ducats Of this tribute, because the French could
have no part, after the division made with Ferdinand, as being owners only of
Lavoro and Abruzzo: they began to be discontented with the Spaniard; insomuch,
that breaking into open war, the French seeking to increase their shar^,
quite lost it. The people of these two last Provinces are troubled with a
Tarantula, curable only with music.

There is no nation under the Sua, which has suffered so many mutations of
slave, Hist. of Ita.
as the Neopolitans: The Region being first under diverse people, was subjected
to the Roman Consuls; In the division of the Empire betwixt Charles of the
West, and Nicephorus of the East; this Country was assigned to Nicephorus and
his successors; who were almost utterly vanquished by the Sarazens, under the
conduct of Sabba, and other successive generals; These were partly dispossessed
by the Emperor Otho 1, and his Almames; and they again expelled by the Greeks
and Sarazens, who for a long time held bitter wars one against the other.
During these wars it happened, that one Dra^got a Gentleman of of Normandy,
having in the presence of Duke Robert (Father to William the Conqueror) slain
one Repostell, a Gentleman of the like quality; to avoid the fury of the Duke,
and the trains of Repostels friends, fled into this Country, attended by such
of his followers, as either best loved him, or had bin medlers in the fray. The
Duke of Beneuent, Vicegerent to the Eastern Emperor, took him and his small
retinue into pay. Their entertainment being bruited in Normandy; and withal a
report being raised, that the Greek Viceroy willingly harkned after men of
the like valor; caused diverse private Gentlemen to pass the Alps, and there
venture their lives to mend their fortunes. The happy success of these last
aadventurers, drew thither also Tancred Lord of Hauteville in Normandy; who
with his 12 sons came into Apulia, Anno 1008. He and his successors not only
drove thence the Sarazens, Munster.
but also the Grecians, keeping possession to themselves with the title of the
Dukes of Calabria, amongst whom, two were famous, viz: Robert Guiscard, third
son to Tancred, the most famous captain of his time, and chief establisher of
the Normane Kingdom in Italy; and Boemound his eldest son; who going with
Godfrey of Bulloigne into the Holy Land, was for his merits installed King of
Antioch. Roger, Nephew to this Boemound, was the first that entitled himself
King of Naples and Sicily: a title which the Pope^ neither could endure, nor
remedy.

years.

wife the daughter of John di Brenn^, the titulary king of Jerusalem: of which,
the kings of Naples have ever since entitled themselves Kings; and in their
rights (...) the Spanish. 1250 7 Conrade, poisoned by his base brother Manfroy,
having reigned 4 years. 1254 8 Manfroy, against whom Urban the fourth, called
in Charles of Aniou and Provence, brother to Lewis the 10 of France. He had one

in the Throne of N^ples* (...) time Peter of Arragon, claimed the Kingdom of
Naple^, in right of Constance his wife, daughter to Man^roy. To save the
effusion of blood, Charles challenged Peter to fight hand to hand in Bordeaux,
before King Edward the first of England; but while Charles there expected
Peter, he seized on Sicily, 1281. This Charles reigned 23 years. 1284 10
Charles II his son, formerly prisoner to Peter of Arragon in Sicily, was
ransomed by the procuration of king Edward aboue-named, for 30000 marks. This
King by Mary, daughter to Stephen King of Hungary, had 14 children; the most
pertinent are Charles King of Hungary by right of his Mother; then Robert King
of Napl^s, and Le^is of Durazzo. 26. 1310 11 Robert 32. 1342 12 Ioane, Niece to
Robert, m^rried Andrew, second son to Charles King of Hungary, whom she hanged
^t her window for insufficiency: her second husband wa^ Lewis of Tarentum, who
ouer-straining himself to (...) appetite, died: Then she married James of
Tarracon, ^ gallant Gentleman, whom she beheaded for b^ing with another woman:
and lastly Otho, D. of B^unswi^^^, who outliued her. This Queen was driven one
of her Kingdom by Lewis of Hungary and hanged at the same window where she
hanged her first husband: she adopted Lewis D. of Aniou, having reigned 29
years.
The Hungarian line.
1371 13 Charles son to Lewis of Durazzo, by the help of Lewis King of Hungary,
and Pope Urban VI, was made King of Naples. He overthrew and killed Lewis of
A^^^* and after the death of Lewis of Hungary, he was made King of that
Kingdom also, wherein he lived not long, being poisoned by the old Queen. 15.
1386 14 Ladislaus. This King on some grudge forced an entry into Rome, and was
tr^umphantly received; for which the Pope called in Lewis 2d of Aniou, who gave
Ladislaus a great overthrow: insomuch that Ladislaus used to say, that if Lewis
had followed his victory the first day, he had bin Lord of my Kingdom and
Person: if the second day, of my Kingdom, but not of my Person: but the third
day of neither. So at the end Lewis was compelled to fly to Rome. 29 1415 15
Ioane, sister to Ladislaus, of the same lascivious dishonesty of life, as the
former Ioane: she first adopted Alfonso V King of Arragon; and after upon some
unkindness, revoked that adoption, and confirmed the state to Lewis D. of Aniou,
and after his death to his brother Rene or Rainold, who was dispossessed by the
Arragon^ys. 19

expelled by Charles the 8 of France, son to Lewis II of France, and heir to
Rene, the last adopted son of Queen Ioane the second. 1494 20 Charles after the
conquest, was crowned king of Naples, (at what time the French pox beginning in
Naples, was first known in Europe.) But returning into France, and leaving the
people much discontented, and the Realm meanly provided for; gave opportunity
to Ferdinand to recover his Kingdom: and he not long enjoying the fruits of
his victory, left it to his Uncle Frederick. So that in 3 years space here
were in Naples, no fewer the^ 6 kings, viz: Fernando the first, Alphonso 2d,
Fernando 2d, Charles of France, Fernando again, and this Frederick. 1497 21
Frederick, who submitted himself to Lewis XII King of France, and yielded up
his Kingdom to him. And indeed what else could the poor Prince do, when he
saw his own blood, and such as had taken his Realm into their protection,
conspire against him. When Charles made his passage toward Naples, Ferdinand
the Catholic sent Gonsalvo (who was afterward for his valor surnamed the
great Captain) with some forces to resist the French victories. But when the
French were expelled, Gonsalvo would not leave the Country, because his master
had not as yet sent for him. In the mean time it was agreed between Lewis of
France, and this Ferdinand; that they should jointly set upon the kingdom of
Naples, and having won it, the French should possess Alruzz^ and Lavoro; the
Spaniard, Puglia and both Calabrias; that the first should be entitled king of
Naples, the latter Duke of Apulia. This confederacy was kept secret till the
French Forces were come to Rome, and Gonsalvo possessed (under pretense of
defending it) all Calabria: So that no marvel was, if they made themselves
masters of the Country. In this action the French king dealt very indiscre^tly,
in bringing into Italy (where he was before the sole Moderator) an other king;
to whom, as to his Rival, his enemies might have recourse^ and the Spanish very
unnaturally, in betraying for the moietie of a kingdom, a Prince of his own
blood, under pretense and promises of succors. These two Princes continued not
long friendly neighbors; for the Spaniards disagreeing with the French, within
two or three years drove them out of all; and have to this day kept it; though
this Lewis his successors Francis, and Henry, have diverse times, and with great
effusion of blood, attempted it.

2 The PAPACY.
THE LAND OF THE CHVRCH extends North and South from the Adriatique to the
Tuscan Seas; Maginus.
the Eastern bounds being Axofenus and Trontus, by which it is separated from
Naples. On the Northwest it is bounded with the Rivers Po and F^ore, by which
it is divided from the Venetian; and on the Southwest with Piss^o, by which it
is parted from the Florentine. The men of this Country are questionless the
best Soldiers of Italy, as retaining some spark of their Ancestors valor.
The soil is as the rest of Italy.

The Provinces hereof are
1. ROMANDIOLA, extending from the Rubicon East, to the Venetians on the West;
from the Appenine South; to Padus, and the Adriatique on the North. The chief
Cities are 1 Bononiae, the chief University of Italy, and a retiring place of
the Popes. Lewk^o^
The civil Law is much studied here; insomuch that from hence proceeded the
famous Civilians, Johannes Andreas, Aza, Bartolus, and Socinus. I believe they
have built Castles in the air, which ascribe the founding of this University
to Theodosius the 2d. The charter of this Foundation dated Anno 423, is an idle
and foolish thing; for there it is said, that at the institution, there were
present Gualter Earl of Poicteirs Ambassador for the king of England, and
Baldwin Earl of Flanders for the king of France; when at that time neither
those Earledomes or those kingdoms, were in re um natura. It is situat^on the
river Aposa, Florus.
and was by former writers called Folsina, now B^logne. Near unto this town
was that meetin^ between A^gustus, A^tonie, and Lepid^s, whe^ein they agreed on
the Trv^virate: dividing the Empi^e and city of Rome among them three. This
combination was confirmed by the ensuing Pr^scription, wherein that they might
be revenged on Cr^ero L^pulus proscribed his brother; A^tonius his Uncle. 2
R^mano anciently called Arimmum, seated on the mouth of the ^^uer Rubicon. The
sudden taking of this city by Caesar, so frighted Pompey and ^is faction, that
they abandoned Rome, leaving it to the courtesy of Caesar, and withdrew into
Epirus. The night before Caesar dre^med, that he carnally knew his mother;
whereby the Soothsayers gathered, that he should be Lord of Rome, which was the
common mother of them all, and so indeed it happened. 3 Cervia, on the Adriatique
Sea, where there is made so much salt, that the Popes part amounts to 60000
Crowns. 4 ^errara, whose Territories stretch in length 160 miles, in breadth
50; and contain the worthy Cities of Modena and Rhegium. The chief City
Ferrara, Hist. of Ita.
so called from the Iron-mines about it, is seated on the bank of Po, which by
reason of his breadth, depth, and swiftnes, is a sufficient rampire on that
side; and on the other it is fortified with a strong wall, and a spacious moat.
In the midst of the Town is a fair Green, into which there do open on all
sides about 19 streets; most of which are half a mile in length, and so even,
that the ends may easily be seen: the whole compass is five miles. This town
after the ruin of the Longobordan kingdom, belonged to the Germane Emperors,
till the year 110^, in which the Countess Mathilda or Maudo took it, together
with Mantua and Par^ra, from the Emperor Henry the third; and dying without
issue, gave her whole estate both by conquest and inheritance, unto the Church
of Rome. The Roman Bishops not long after, gave this town to Azo of the house
of Este, in whose line it continued until the year 1589; when the last Duke
dying without lawful issue, the Dukedom returned to the Church; and added to
the Popes Dominions, 250000 Ducats of yearly revenue. 5 Ravenna, once
beautified with one of the fairest havens in the world, was for that cause made
the Road of one of the two Navies which Aug^stus kept always manned, Dion.
to command the whole Empire of Rome; the other riding at Misenum in Campania.
This of Ra^onna being in the upper sea, awed and defended, Dalmatia, Gree^ce,
Cr^te, Cyprus, Asia, etc. the ^ther of Misenum in the lower sea, protected and
kept under, France, Spain, Afric, Egypt, Syria, etc. This city has bin
honored also with the seat of the ^mperour Honorius, and his successors; next
of the Gothish kings; then of the Exarchs; and last of its Patriarchs; chosen
for this purpose, because of the plentiful territory now covered with water;
Machiav.
and the conveniencie of the Haven at this day choked. When the Emperors kept
at Constantinople, Italy was made a prey to all barbarous people; to repress
whose fury, the Emperor Justinian sent a Vice-regent into Italy, whom he
called his Exarch; who leaving Rome, kept his residence at Ravenna, for its
site nigh unto Constantinople, the residence of the Emperors. Under this
Exarch were comprehended these ten Cities, Ravenna, Bolognia, Regium, Modena,
Parma, Placentia, Sarcina, Class, Furli, Fo^limpoli. This was properly called
the Exarchate of Ravenna; as the count^ie which having no subordinate
Magistrate, immedi^t^ly obeyed the Exarch of Ravenna. In other towns of
importance, there were by the Exarchs, gouern^r^ appointed, who^ they honored
with the title of Dukes. Rome it self, so far was it then from obeying the
Popes had one of these ^^lled Dukes, sen^ hither yearly from Ravenna: and his
government was the Roman Dukedom. This division of Italy into so many members,
most of which were too big for the head to govern, was ^he cause that the
Longobards with m^re f^cility, subdued the greater part of Italy; into which, a
little before the erection of this magistracy, they were entered.

the King Pepi^ his Father, by the consent and authority of the Popes. The
donation of this Exarchate to the Popes, partly to blot out the memory of the
Exarchs; and partly to make the people obedient to the Prelates, changed the
name of the count^y from Flaminia (by which it was formerly known) to
Romandiola, and now to Romagna.
2. MARCHA ANCONITANA, formerly the dwelling of the Piceni, Adrianus.
is bounded with Romagna, the Appennine, Naples, and the Adriatique. The chief
towns are Ancona, seated on the hill Cimmerius, which shoots into the Sea
like a Prom^ntory; this town glories in giving name to the whole Province, and
in her Haven built by Traian the Emperor. Florus.
2 Ascoli the fair, of old called Asculum, conquered by the Romans, under the
conduct of Sempronius, Ao V. C. 685. Nigh unto this city was fought the second
battle between C. Fabricius, and the Romans on the one side, and Pyrrhus with
his Epyrots on the other: wherein the victory fell to the king, having slain
6000 of his enemies. Yet with such apparencie of valor and virtue in the
Romans, that he could not but break into this exclamation, O quam facile esset
orbe^ vincere, aut mihi Romany militibus, aut merege Romany. This town also
was the seat of the war called bell^^s sociale, raised by the people of Italy
against the Romans; Popedius being both author of the rebellion, and Captain.
They sorely shaked the state of Rome; but at last they were vanquished, and
this town by Strabo Pompeius forced and spoiled. 3 Firmo the strong. 4 Macera^a

3. DVCATO SPOLETANO, of old called Vmbria, because being situate under the
Appennines, it was Regio Vmbrosa. The chief cities are Spoleto, naming the
whole Province. 2 Ovietto seated on so high a rock, Adrianus.
that it is a terror to look down to the Valleys: here is a Church of a
wondrous lightness, whose windows are made with Alablaster in steed of
glass. 3 Perugia, formerly called Perusia. In this town Augustus beseiged L.
Antonius the brother, and Fulvia the wi^e of Antony the Triumvir; who when they
had in vain attempted to seduce Rome from the faction of Augustus; returned to
this City which also at last yielded to the more fortunate Emperor. This
town did a long time belong to the Baillons, Guicciard.
who held it as Vicars of the Church. To these Baillons was the family of the
Oddies much opposite, insomuch that having got together a pretty army of
malcontents; they so suddenly one night entered the City, that the Baillons
began to fly. The Oddies were now come to the Palace gates, into which
nothing hindered them from entering but a chain drawn cross the gate. One of
the Soldiers had a hatchet purposely to take away the bar, but wanting room
to we^ld his arm, he cried give back, give back. These words heard, but not
understood by the hin-most, put them to their heels; and the foremost thinking
that they ^led not for nothing, run away too: and so the city was saved. 4
Asis, where St Francis was borne. In this Country is Lago di Perugia of

three hours with such eagerness, that the Sould^ers felt not the grievous
earthquake happening at the same time. Here also is Lacus Vademonius, where
Do^abella overthrew such of the G^uls, as had escaped the sword of Camillus: Ne

4. St PETER'S PATRIMONY, containing all Latium (or Campagna di Roma) and part
of Hetruria: was given unto the Church by the brave Virago Mathilda, Ano 1101,
Pascal II, sitting in the Chair of Rome: it is bounded with Pisseo hard by
Siena, the Appenine, Naples, and the Tyrrhenean Seas. Here are the Mountains
called Gallicanum, in which Annib^l that Father of warlike stratagems, frighted
that politic and wary Captain Fab. Maximus, Plutarch.
with 2000 Oxen carrying fire on their horns, and so passed over the
mountains. Here are the Rivers Tiber and Al^^a, nigh unto which last, Br^nnus
and his Gauls (being drawn into Italy by the sweet taste of the Italian wines)
slaughtered the Romans. The Roman Army consisted of 40000 Soldiers, most of
them being raw, and unexperienced. The Gauls were not more in number but were
naturally of a fierce and hardy courage, and withal so bigboned, that it
seems they were borne to be the terror of mankind, and the ruin of
Cities. Having won the day, the Barbarians march toward Rome, forsaken of
its chiefest strength, the Capitol only being manned by Manlius: which also
they had mastred, if the Geese had not been more vigilant then the Watch. When
they had failed of this enterprise, they began a treaty with the fathers of
the Town: agreeing with them for ^000 pound weight of Gold, to forsake the
City. But before the delivery of this mo^y, they were assaulted and vanquished
by Camillus, who for this is called Romes second founder. The overthrow at
Al^^a, and the vanquishment of the Fabij, happened in one day, which was
therefore by the old Romans put among the unfortunate days; they never on that
day at empting any business of importance. The like custom, whether on
superstition, or fear of ill luck, is used by many Christians; and especially
on Childerm^s day: wherein Phi^i^ de Commes tells us, that Lewis the 11th
used not to debate any matter, but accounted it a sign of some great
misfortune toward him, if any man comuned with him of his affairs: and would
be marvelously displeased with those that were near about him, if they
troubled him in any matter whatsoever.

The chief Cities are and were Alba, the seat of the Silvian Kings, ruined by
Tullus Hostilius. In this war was Rome as it were laid to stake against Alba,
and the whole action committed by the Romans to the Hora^ij, and by the Albans
to the Curiatij, three brethren of each side. In this treble duel, two of the
Horatij were slain, but the third counterfeiting flight, severed hi^ enemies,
and severally slew them; so making Alba and the Latins subject to Rome. 2
Ostia built by Ancus Martius, at the m^uth of Tiber, whose Haven has been
long damped up, to stop the passage of enemies ships to Rome. The Bishop of
this town uses to consecrate the Popes. 3 Antrum, whether the Emperors did
use to retire for recreation. The Roman Co^sull Maenius having won this
City, Plutarch.
and broken their force at sea, brought with him to Rome the Beaks of their
ships, with which he decked and beautified the pulpit for Orations, which have
generally since, been called Rostra. 4 Tibur. 5 Preneste, taken by Quinctius
Cincinnatus the Dictator. Nothing so much endamaged this City, as its natural
and artificial fortifications; for when the Romans in the times of sedition
abandoned the town, they made this place their refuge. Among others, Marius
the younger made it the seat of his war against Sylla; but perceauing the
unprosperous succeding of his affairs, here kill^d himself: and Sylla entering
as conqueror, put 12000 of the Citizens to the sword. Florus.
6 Ardea taken by Superbus; a town to which the miserable Romans fled when the
Gauls had won Rome. 7 Gabij, taken also by Superbus, and his son Sextus:
who counterfeiting a loathing of his fathers cruelty* fled to Gabij, and was
made Captain of the town, which he betrayed to the Romans. 8 Veij, a City of
great wealth and compass. It was many times assaulted by the Romans in
general: once by the Fabij as particular adventurers, all which being 306 in
number were slain in one day. Veientibus aruis
Tercentum Fabij ter cecidere duo.
On the Veiean plain
Three hundred and six Fabij were slain.
There was by hap a little child of this family left at home, who did again
restore the house, and was the Ancestor of Fab. Maximus, the preserver of Italy
against Annibal. This city at last, after a ten years siege was taken by
Furius Camillus, and not long after leuelled with the earth, because the Roman
people so delighted in the situation of the place, that they were resolved to
have forsook Rome, and dwelt there. 9 Tivolis where there is a fountain,
which by artificial works driven with water, represents the notes of diverse
birds. 10 Rome, once the Mistress of the universe, famous for her triumphs and
antiquities; is seated on Tiber now well grown by the receipt of 42 rivers, and
is distant from the Sea fifteen miles. This city built by Romulus, was in
circuit about two miles, and contained 30000 inhabitants: which in the
flourishing of that commonwealth, increased to 463000, Ortelius.
and the compass of the Town to fifty miles, there being on the walls above
740 Turrets. When I said there were 463000 inhabitants, I mean not also
servants, women and children; but men able to bear arms, free denizens, and
such as were enrolled into cense. To these if we add their children, wives,
and servants, we cannot probably conjecture them to have been fewer then 3 or
4 millions: and so Lipsius in his tract de magnitudine Romana, is of opinion.
The extent of the Roman Empire was answerable to the multitude of inhabitants,
Brerewood.
the revenue correspondent to the extent. It was in length about 2000 miles;
namely from the Irish Ocean West, to the river Euphrates on the East: in breadth
it reached from the Danubius Northward, to mount Atlas on the South, about 2000
miles. And though the Romans had extended their Dominions sometimes farther
East then North; yet could they never quietly settle themselves in these
conquests. Nature, it seems, had appointed them these bounds, not so much to
limit their empire, as to defend it; for the enemies found these rivers, by
reason of the depth of the channel, and violent current of the stream as a
couple of impregnable fortresses, purposely erected to hinder them from
harasing the Roman Country. The revenewes Lipsius in the former tract esteems
to be about 150 millions of Crowns* and that they were no less, may be made
more then probable by these reasons. 1 It is affirmed by diverse, and among
others by Boterus that the yearly revenewes of the king of China amount unto
120 millions of Crowns; and if this be true (as few question it) we cannot in
proportion guess the whole Empire of the Romans to yield less then 150
millions: especially considering what arts masters the Romans were in levying
and raising their taxes, and customary tributes. 2ly, The Legionary Soldiers
which were dispersed over the Provinces, received in ordinary pay (besides
provision of corn, apparel, and officers wages) five millions, and 516062l
and 10s of our money; which amounts unto 16 millions of Crowns, or
thereabout. In the City it self there were kept in continual pay, 7000
Soldiers of the watch, 4 or 6000 for the defense of the City, and 10000 for
the guard of the Emperors persons. The two first had the same wages; the last,
the double wages of a Legionary Soldier. Add hereto the expenses of the
palace, and other means of disbursalls, and I think nothing of the sum can
be abated. 3ly, we read that C. Caligula spent in one year two millions and
700000 of Sestertiums: how Nero most lavishly gave away two millions and 100000
of Sestertiums: and how Vitollius in a few months was 900000 of Sestertiums in
arrerages. All huge and infinite sums. 4ly, When Vespasian came to the
Empire, the Exchequer was so impouerished, that he protested in open Senate,
that he wanted to settle the Commonwealth 40 millions of Sest^rtiums, which
protestation, (says Sueton) seemed probable, quia and male partis optime vsu^
est. Now unless the ordinary revenewes came to as much, or more then we have
spoken, by what means could this extraordinary sum be raised. 5ly, We may
guess at the general revenew, by the moneys issuing out of particular
Provinces; and it is certain that Egypt afforded to the Ptolomies 12000
Talents yearly, neither had the Romans less, they being more perfect in
inhancing then abating their intradoe. France was by Caesar cessed at the
yearly tribute of 20 millions of Crowns: And I think the rest of the
Provinces were rated accordingly. 6ly, and lastly, the infinite sums of money
given by the Emperors in way of largess, are proofs sufficient for the
greatness of the income. I will instance in Augustus only, and in him,
omitting his donatiues at the v^ctory of A^luim, and the rest, I will specify
his Legacy at his dea^^. he bequeathed by his Testament to the common sort, and
the rest of the people, 3l 8^ a man. To every Soldier of the Praetorian bands
7 16^ and 3d. And to every Legionary Soldier of the Roman Citizens, 46^ 10 l
ob. Which amounts to a mighty mass of money: And let this suffice for the
Roman revenew; now we return to Rome it self.

In this Town was the Capitol saved from the fury of the Gauls, by the
cackling of Geese. Tacitus calls this house S^aem Iovis optimi maximi,
auspicato a maioril us pignus m^^^ri cond^tam It was twice burnt, Dion.
once in the civil wars of Syl^a and Marius; and again in the wars of
Vespasian and Vudlius. In the third building of it, Vespasian carried the first
basket of earth; after him the nobility did the like, to make the people more
forward in the service; and perhaps the custom of laying the first stone in a
building, or driving the first nail in a timber-worke, by him whose edifice it
is; has from hence, if not beginning, yet growth. Here was the Temple of
Ianus, open in the time of wars, and shut in the time of peace* which during
all their Monarchy happened but thrice: namely during the reign of Augustus,
after the Puni^ke war; and in the time of Numa Here was the br^dge called

That Peter was at Rome is questioned ever,
That Simon was at Rome was doubted never.
The maine argument the adversaries have out of the Scriptures is taken out of
the first of Peter, the fifth Chap. and 13 ver. where the Apostle says, The
Church that is at Babylon saluteth you, By this word Babylon they say, is meant
Rome; and the Rhemists in the annotations on their translation of the
Testament, much blame the ingenuity of our men, in affirming Babylon to signify
Rome in the Apocalips, but not here. Since they so honestly and freely grant
the one, I see not any inconvenience that would follow if we granted the other.
And so let Peter be at Rome, and Rome be Babylon, the Popes the whores thereof.
That Peter was the Prince of the Apostles, or that his suffering there could
co^ferre on the Roman Bishops any supremacy over the Church: would (I suppose)
be hardly proved, if we granted that Peter had bin there, as most histories
testify. But that Rome by their own confession, should be Babylon, makes much
for our side; notwithstanding their idle distinction of the Church in Babylon,
and the whore of Babylon; which they say, is the heathen Emperors of Rome,
then living. But this interpretation cannot stand: for St John spoke by way of
prophecy, what in future times should be, not in way of declaration what
already was: and again, Antichrist must be in the Church, not out of it. F^^
St Paul tells us, (...); that he as God, shall sit in the Temple of God, 2 Thessalonians. 2.4. But whosoever was the first Bishop, certain it is, they were
subject to much persecution, and little worldly joy, till the time of Silvester
the 31 Bishop, who having converted Constantine, left case to his successors:
On which Constantine, is fathered a donation of Rome, and her territories to
the Roman Church, which certainly is forged. But Phocas having killed the
Emperor Mauretius his wif^ and children, Anno 604: to assure himself of
Italy, ready to revolt from so barbarous a tyrant, made Boniface the third,
universal Bishop, and head of the Church. Before this time, the Bishops of
Constantinople, and Ravenna, did often dispute with the Bishops of Rome for
superiority; the seat of Religion commonly following the seat of the Empire.
And the Bishops of Constantinople prevailed so far, that with the permission
of Mauritius the Emperor, he took upon him the title of Universal
Patriarch. Gregory the great (of whom it is said that he was the worst Bishop
of all that went before him, and the best of all that came after him) was at
that time Bishop of Rome. He sharply inveighed as well against the Emperor, as
the Patriarch of Constantinople for this title; and plainly maintained that
whosoever called himself Universal Bishop, was the forerunner of Antichrist.
As for himself, it is probable that he took the title of servus servorum Dei,
more in opposition to him of Constantinople, then with an intent to be so. To
this our adversaries answer, that Gregory did not absolutely condemn this
title; but only blamed John the Constantinopolitan Patriarch, for assuming to
himself the attribute which properly belonged to the Sea of Rome. But this
cannot be; for then we should either in the old Bulls of the former Popes, find
mention of this title: or self Greg. would have assumed it to himself that
the world might take notice whereto of right it was due. This Boniface whom
that cruel and butcherly tyrant Phocas made head of the Church, was the 64
Bishop, and first Pope of Rome, the Latin word Papa, coming from the old
Greek word (...), which signifies a Father.

now living. To These 180 Popes, add the 63 Bishops; and they make the full
number of 243.
It were a task too great for Hercules, to show all the acts and pious decrees
of all these ghostly fathers: We will therefore only make mention of some
principal passages, for the better understanding of their history and policies.

1. Paschalis the first, caused the Priests of some Parishes in Rome, by reason
of their neerenesse to his person, their presence at his election, and to
honor their authority with a more venerable title, to be called Cardinals.
They are now mates for Kings, and numbered about 70. 2. Eugenius the second took
on him the authority of creating Earls, Dukes, and knights; as the Exarchs of
Ravenna had formerly used to do. 3. Sergius the second was the first that
changed his name; for thinking his own name Bocca di Porco, or Swines-mouth,
not consonant to his dignity; he caused himself to be called Sergius: which
president his successors following, do also vary their names. So that if one
be a coward, he is called Leo; if a Tyrant, Clemens; if an Atheist, Pius or
Innocons; if a Rustic, Vrbanus; and so of the rest. 4. Nicholas the second,
took from the Roman Clergy, the election of the Popes, allotting it to the
Con^laue ol Cardinals. 5. Nicholas the third, was the first Pope that practiced
to enrich his kindred, and his successors have studied nothing more then to
advance their Nephews, (for by that name the Popes use to call their
bastards:) whence came that worthy saying of Alexander the third; The laws
forbid us to get children, and the Devil has given us Nephews in their
steed. 6. John the eight, is by most writers confessed to be a woman, and is
usually called Pope Ioane. To avoid the like disgrace, the Porphyrie chair was
ordained; Vbi ab ultimo Diacono, etc. so that both in a literal and mystical
sense, this woman may be called, The whore of Babylon. Fox Mart.
7. Innocent the third held a council in Rome; in which it was enacted, that
the Pope should have the correction of all Christian Princes, and that no
Emperor should be acknowledged, till he had sworn obedience to him: He
invented Transul stantiation; and ordained that there should be a Pix to cover
the Bread, and a Bell to be rung before it. He also brought Aur^cular
Confession into the Church. 8. Sixtus the fourth builded in Rome, Stews of
both sexes, he brought in Beads; and made our Ladies Psalter. 9. Sergius the
third instituted the bearing about of Candles, for the purification of the
blessed Virgin Mary. 10. Nicholas the first prohibited the Clergy marriage,
saying; that it was more honest to have to do with many women privately, than
openly to take one wife. Insomuch that a Priest of Placentia being accused to
have wife and children, was deprived of his Benefice; but proouing the said
woman to be the wife of another man, and but his Concubine, he was again
restored. 11. Celestine 2d was the inventor of that mad cursing, by Bell,
Book, and Candle. 12. Bonifac^ the eight, by a general Bull, exempted the
Clergy from all taxes and subsidies to temporal Princes. Whereupon our Edward
the first, put the Clerg^e out of the protection of him and his Laws. By which
course, the Popes Bull left roaring in England. He was the author of the
Decretals. 13. Pope Clement the sixth lived in an vnhaypy time; for in his
Papacy the Emperor gave freely all Lands belonging to the Church, Machiav.
to such as former^y had usurped them, and that they should hold them by
authority Imperial. Thus the Malatesti became Lords of Rimino, the Ordelaffi
of Furli; the Varani of Camerine, the Bentivoles of Bologne, the Manfre^i of
Fuenza, etc. Which estates were never recovered to the Church, till the days
of Alexander the sixth, and Iulio the second. 14. Sergius the fourth, was the
first that on Christmasse night, with diverse ceremonies, Sleid. Cont.
consecrated swords, roses, or the like; which afterward are sent as a token of
love and honor to such Princes as best them like. Leo 10th sent a consecrated
rose to Frederick Duke of Saxony, desiring him to banish Luther. The like did
Clement 7th to our Henry 8th, for writing against Luther. So Paul the third
sent an hallowed sword to James the fifth of Scotland, when he began the war
with our Henry 8th. The like did Julius the second to our Henry 7th, in his
wars against his Rebels. 15. Boniface the eight, instituted the Roman Iubile,
and decreed that it should be solemnized every hundred year; but by Clement
the sixth, it was brought to fifty. 16. Alexander the sixth, Guicciard.
setting aside all modesty, was the first that unmasked his Nephews,
acknowledging them to be his sons. He recovered to the Papacy, Imola, Furlie,
and many other towns, by the valor of his son Caesar Borgia, a true chip of
the old block; whom notwithstanding all his villainies, Machiauell proposes in
his Tract de Principe, as the only example for a Prince to imitate. 17. Clement
the fifth, Du Pless.
taught (as indeed it is true) that one drop of our Saviors blood had bin
enough to have saved all mankind; but (this he added), seeing that all that
precious blood was spilt, the ouer-plus was given as a treasure to the Church;
to be disposed according to the discretion of S. Peter, and his successors.
Hereunto they joined the merits of the Virgin Mary, and all the Saints; so that
this treasure can never be drawn dry: and hereon he founded the virtue of
Pardons and Indulgences. 18. Leo the tenth, was indeed a great favorer of
learning, but so little sauoured he of Religion, that he was often heard to
say, Quantas nobis divitias comparavit ista fabula Christi: a speech so
blasphemous, that Porphyrie, or Julian the Apostata's could never match it. In
his time began the Reformation according to the Word of God taught by Luther.
These matters are most pertinent: but to rip up the life of every particular,
would rather grieve then delight me, and get amazement in the hearer, not
belief. I will therefore end with the Painter, who being blamed by a Cardinal,
for coloring the visages of Peter and Paul too red, tartly replied; that he
painted them so, as blushing at the lives of those men, who styled themselves
their successors.

We before touched at Constantines donation, avouching it to be forged; and
well might we so do, considering how fearful the Popes are, in having their
title disputed, insomuch that many leaves are razed out of Guicciardine by the
Inquisition, where this donation was called in question. In the place, the
hist^^rian not only denies the fained donation of Constantine, but affirms
that diverse learned men reported Silvester and him to have lived in diverse
ages. Then he shows how obscure and base the authority of the Popes was,
during the time that the barbarous Nations made havoc of Italy: 2ly, that in
the institution of the Exarchate, the Popes had nothing to do with the
temporal sword; but lived as subjects to the Emperors, 3ly, that they were
not very much obeyed in matters spiritual, by reason of the corruption of
their manners. 4ly, that the overthrow of the Exarchate, the Emperors now
neglecting Italy, the Romans began to be governed by the advice and power of
the Popes. 5ly, that Pepin of France, and his son Charles; having overthrown
the kingdom of the Lombards, gave unto the Popes, the Exarchate, Vrbine,
Ancona, Spoleto; and many other towns and territories about Rome. 6ly, that
the Popes in all their Bulls or Charters, expressed the date in these formal
words; Such a one our Lord the Emperor reigning. 7l^, that long after the
translation of the Empire from France to Germany, the Popes began to make open
protestation, that the Pontifical dignity was rather to give Laws to the
Emperors, then receive any from them. 8ly, that being thus raised to an
earthly power, they forgot the salvation of souls, sanctity of life, and the
commandments of God, propagation of Religion, and charity toward men. To
raise arms, to make war against Christians, to invent new devices for
getting of money, to profane sacred things for their own ends, and to enrich
their kindred and children; was their only study. And this is the substance of
Guicciardine in that place, an author above all exception; he was a man whom
the Popes employed in many businesses of rare importance, so that no hate to
them, but love to the truth made him write thus much. As for the city of Rome,
so unlikely is it to have bin given by Constantine, that neither Pepin, nor
Charles his son could be induced to part with it. Lewis surnamed Pius is said
to be the first donour thereof, and a copy of this donation is found in the
third book of Volaterran, subscribed by the Emperor, his three sons, ten
Bishops, eight Abbots, fifteen Earls, and the Popes Library Keeper. Yet
Lampadius in his Comment on Sleidan affirms, that it was by many learned and
judicions men maintained, that all this was foisted into the text by Anastasius
the Popes Library Keeper, who is cited as a witness of the donatio^. Let us hear
what the recorder of Florence says in this case. Rome (says he) was always
subject to the Lords of Italy, till Theodorick king of the Goths removed his
seat to Rauenna, for hereby the Romans were enforced to submit themselves to
the Bishops, Ao 460 or there about. And again talking of the estate of the
Popedom in the year 931. The Popes (says he) had in Rome more or less
authority according to the favor they found with the Emperors, or others then
most mighty. But the leaving of Italy by the German Emperors, seated the Pope
in a more absolute sovereignty over the City.

Having thus a little glanced at the means by which the present demaines of
the Church of Rome, were first gotten and increased: Let us consider by what
policies this Papal Monarchy has been vpheld in respect and magnificence.
They may be divided into three heads. 1 Those by which they have insinuated and
screwed themselves into the affections and affairs of the most potent Princes.
2 Those by which already they have and by which hereafter they will be a^le to
secure their own estate. And 3d, those by which they keep the people both in
blindness, and due obedience.

1. Concerning the first: Sands relig.
First, the donation of several kingdoms to them that have no right or title,
but from the Pope, and in force of his donation; cannot but oblige them to him,
without whom they could lay no title to what they possess. 2ly Next the
readiness of their Ministers to kill such as resist the^, cannot but deter
Princes from injuring them, and constrain them to seek their friendship:
especially since by a w^it of Excommunication they can arm the subjects
against the Sovereign; and without levying a Soldier, either utterly destroy
him, or bring him to good conformity. 3ly Then follows their allowance of
marriages prohibited by God and Nature, the issue of which, cannot but uphold
the Popes infinite authority; without whom, their birth is unnatural, and
their persons not capable of the estates which by his allowance they hold;
wherein they strengthen themselves more, by unlawful matches of others, then
ever Prince could by lawful marriage of his own. 4ly They comes in their
dispensing with the Oaths of Princes, by which such Princes both preserve
their credit, in not being perjured, as they think, since allowed by the
Church: and also get somewhat for which they cannot be unthankful to the
Papacy. 5ly Then succeeds in order the choosing of the younger sons of potent
families into their Cardinalships: by which means, the whole lineage are ready
to support him, as the chief staff of their brother or Cosens preferment. 6ly
As by these courses he holds in with all Princes of his religion in general;
so has he fastened o^ the King of Spain in particular, by making him and his
successors the executioners of his excommunications. By this office Ferdinando
the Catholic surprised Navarre; and Philip the 2d had no small hopes to have
done the like on England and France.

2. Concerning the second: so it is, that first their state has the firmest
foundation of any; as being laid in the conscience of men, by persuading them
of their infallible power: and the Ecclesiastical and temporal jurisdiction
over Heaven, Hell, Earth and their Purgatory. 2ly Next comes the innumerable
preferments for men of all sorts and humors, (as having well high in their
disposing, all the Benefices and Bishoprics of Italy, half in Spain, diverse
in France and Germany:) which keep the Clergy in a perpetual bond of
allegiance; especially inioying diverse privileges which they of the
Temporalty are not capable of. 3ly Then consider the multitude of Friars, all
whose hopes depend on his safety: they are known to be more then a Million, of
which half at least would grow fit to be employed in any warlike service; all
which they do maintain at other men's cost, themselves not disbursing a penny.
4ly Their Revenues they increase by their Pardons and Indulgences; amongst
others I read of a Pardon given by Pope Boniface 8th, of whom it is said, he
entered like a Fox, lived like a Lion, and died like a dog* it was a Pardon for
82000 years to all them, which would say such a prayer of St Augustine, and
that for every day ^^ties quoties. 5ly The next help of their Coffers is their
dealing with Peniten^s, whom in the agony of their souls they persuade, that
no help will be easily had, unless by a donation of part of their estates to
the Church. 6ly The last string to this Bow, is the invention of spiritual
fraternities, which are appurtenances or annexaties to the orders of Friars;
and may in number perhaps equal them. Into these the lay people of all sorts,
men and women, married and single, desire to be enrolled; as hereby enjoying
the spiritual prerogatives of Indulgences and speedy dispatch out of Purgatory.

3. Concerning the thi^d; 1, they deter the people from reading the
Scripture; alleging unto them the perils they may incur by
misinterpretatio^: 2ly they breed an antipathy between the Papists and the
Protestants; insomuch that a Papist may not say Amen unto a Protestants Deo
gratias. 3ly they debar them all sound of the religion, in prohibiting the
books of the reformed Writers; and hiding their own treatises, in which the
tenent of the Protestants is recited only to be confuted: insomuch that in all
Italy you shall seldom meet with Bellarmines works, or any of the like nature
to be sold. 4ly They have under pain of excommunication, prohibited the
Italians from travel and traffic with heretical countries* or such places
where those contagious sounds and sights (as they term them) might make the^
return infected. 5ly The severity, or tyranny rather, of the Inquisi^ion, of
which we have elsewhere spoken, crusheth not only the beginnings, but the
smallest suspicions of being this way addicted. And 6ly the people thus
restrained from travel, are taught to believe, that the Protestants are
blasphemers of God and all his Saints: that in England Churches are turned to
stables, the people is grown barbarous, and eat young children: that Geneva is
a professed sanctuary of roguerie, and the like. We have yet two later examples
of their dealing in this kind: 1 the gross slander of the Apostasy (or as
they call it, the reunion) unto their Church, of the right reverend Father in
God, D^ King, late Lord Bishop of London; a Prelate of too known a faith and
zeal, to give occasion for such a calumny. The second is a book by them
lately published, and comm^nly sold in Italy, and France; containing a relation
of Gods Judgments, shown on a sort of Protestant-Hereticks, by the fall of an
house in Blacke-Friers in London, in which they were assembled to hear a
Geneva Lecture; by which dealing, the simple people are made to believe that to
be a judgment on us, which the authors of that pamphlet well know, to be a
calamity (I will ^ot say a judgment) that be fell their own.

Had these Pontifical Prelates bin chosen young, or of the same family, so
that the successor had not through envy, or a new humor, crossed the
designs of his predecessor: it cannot be but that this Monarchy had bin
greater and better established, then the old Roman in her greatest glory. But
this course is distastefull to the ambition of the C^rdinals, who by the deaths
(natural or violent it matters not) of the Pope, aspi^e by all means, both of
love and money, to that dignity. Now the elections of the Popes are made in
this place and manner: for I suppose it will not be impertinent to speak a
little hereof. In the Popes Palace in the hill Vatican, are among other
buildings, 5 halls, 2 chapels, and a gallerie 70 foot long. The gallery is
appointed for conference; the one chapel for the mass, and for the election;
the other with the Halls are for the Cardinals lodgings. Every Hall has two
rows of chambers, which are purposely for the time made of green or violet
cloth. To each Cardinal is allowed four servants to lie in his chamber. They
that are once within, are compelled, unless they be sick, still to continue
there: and such as are once out, are no more permitted to go in; lest by that
means the Cardinals should maintain intelligence with any foreign Princes. To
this Conclaue (for by this name the place of the election is called) is but one
door, to which belongs four locks, and as many keys. One key is in the
keeping of the Cardinals; one of the City-Bishops; one of the Roman nobility;
and one of the Master of the ceremonies. There is in this door a little wicket
or hatch, which is opened only at dinners and suppers; and whereof the Master
of the ceremonies keeps the key. At this hole the Cardinals servants receive
their Meat; every dish being first diligently searched, lest any letters
should be conveyed in them. As for the Lodgings, they have neither holes nor
windows to give light, so that there they make day of wax-candles: And lest
the Pope should be made by force, both the City and Conclaue are strongly
guarded. When the Cardinals are going to election, the privileges of the
Cardinals are recited; which every one swears to observe, in case he be
chosen Pope. Then the Master of the ceremonies ringing a Bell, calls them all
to Mass; which ended, there is brought to every Cardinal, a chair, and
therein a scroll of all the Cardinals names. Before the altar is set a table,
covered with a purple cloth, whereupon is set a chalice, a silver bell; and
about it six stools, on which sit two Bishops, two Priests, and two Deacons.
Every Cardinal writes is voyc^ in a piece o^ paper, goes to the Altar,
prays God to guide him in the election, puts his voice into the chalice,
and departs to his seat. The first Bishop takes out all the papers, and
delivers them to the first Deacon, who unfolding each of them, reads
(without mentioning the name of the Electour) the name of the elected: and
every Cardinal in his particular scroll, notes how many voices every one
has. The account being made, the first Priest having the like scroll,
p^onounceth who has most voices: which done, the Priest ringeth the silver
bell, at which call, the Master of the ceremonies brings in a pan of
coals, and burns all the little papers wherein the names of the elected were
written. He that has the most voices, so that his voices exceed the proportion
of two parts of three, is acknowledged Pope, and adored by the rest of the
Cardinals; but if they exceed not that number, they must begin all anew. If in
the space of 30 days the election be not fully ended* then must the Cardinals
be kept from fire, light and victuals, till they are fully agreed The ^^^ket
which we before mentioned, is called the gold (...), at which stand an infinite
number of people; on (...) Pope, having opened that gate, bestows ^i,
^a^he^ly (...) to (...) all their sin* Then strike^h he cont^nua^ly on the
maine door^ with a golden m^llet; which wh^lest he is doing, workem^n without
bre^ke it open The ch^ppes, (...), dust, and d^rt which falls from the gate
while it is opening, are gathered and preserved as choicest Reliques^ and the
golden mallet is usually g^uen to that Cardinal, who is most in grace with the
new Pope. This is the plain and surple manner of choosing the Spiritual Head
of Christendom, (for I should wrong him if I should omit this title:) but
there is now adai^^ much corruption and preposterousnesse used, as buying of
voyce^, setting up some for st^les, and tearing of scrutinies, every Cardinal
desiring to have a Pope of his own, and his Princes faction. It is written of
an old Sicilian Cardinal, who after long absence, came to the election of a
^ope; where expecting that incessant prayers, is in time of old should have
pointed out (by Divine inspiration) Christ's Vicar; and finding naught but
c^nvasing, promising, and threatening for voices, Ad hu^^ modum (says he) fiunt
Romani Pon^i^ices? and so retired to his home, and never saw Rome again.

Boterus.
The ordinary temporal revenewes of the Papac^e are b^tter then two Millions of
Cr^wnes; the extraordinary and sph^^^all is wonderful. ^ius Quintus, who ruled
six yeare^ on^y* get from the Spanish Clergy 14 m^llions. Sixt^^ the 5th
(...) the Iesuite^ ^t one clap 20000 crowns of yearly rev^nue because they
were too rich f^r men that vowed p^uerty; and ^a^ing sat but five years, had
offered up 5 mi^lion^* four of which hi^ successor ^regory the 14 spent in
(...) then a year. Out of France they reap no less then a million of Crowns
yearly. Out of England, when it was the Pope. (...) ^^^haustus, they extracted
no less th^n 60000 m^^kes, which of our present money is ^^0000 po^nds, being
at that time more then the Kings certain revenue: and this was in the time of
Henry the 3d, before their rapine was come to the height. Let other Countries
be rated accordingly. Next add the moneys received from the particular
pardons, for dispensings with unlawful marriages; the profits arising from
pilgrimage^; from great men's death and funerals; from the Indulgences granted
unto Abbeyes and Convents, in all which the Popes have a share; and it would
pussle a right good Arithmetician to state his int^ado* Here t^ke the saying of
Sixtus the 4, that a Pope could never want money while he held a pen in his
hand. Yet is their treasury seldom full; for 1 the state they keep, because
of their height of honor above all Princes; 2^^ the large allowance they g^u^
unto their Lega^es, Nuncio's, and other Ministers; and 3^ th^^r greedy desire
to enrich their sons or kinsmen with the Churches Lands or money (with which
humor only Pope Sixtus the 5 was never touched) keep their coffers exceeding
low.

The Papal Vestiments are of great value, especially the Triple Crow^e; for
when Clement the 5 transferred his seat to Av^gnion, we read how with a fa^l
from his horse, he l^st a Carbuncle (with which his Crown was thick set) worth
6000 Ducats at the least.

Having in former places mentioned such order of Knighthood, as these Countries
gave beginning to: I will now set down the orders of the Popish spiritual
Knights, or Friars, which his holy Benediction has erected, and fat allowance
does maintain; and for the better proceeding, we will begin with the
original of a monastical life; and then we will make special mention of the
Romish Votaries.

The beginning and increase of a Monastical life.
Under the persecution of Decius, one Paulus borne at Thebes in Ae^ypt* Polyd.
Virg. an^ Groost*
retired to a private cave under the foot of a rock, Anno 260. Here he lived
one hundred years, and was s^ene of no man, but one Anthony, who was present
at his death. This Anthony was the first that followed the example of Paulus:
he was of a noble house* and sold all h^s estate* that he might mo^e privately
enjoy himself: he is called the Father of the Monks: he lived 105 years, and
died Anno 345.

After this foundation, the Monastical building increased so fast, that it
seemed necessary to prescribe them orders: Hereupo^ St. Basil gathered them
together, living formerly dispersed, and was the first that built Monasteries;
he is said to have ordained the three vows, 1 of Poverty, 2 of obedience to
their rules; and 3 of perpetual chastity: he instructed them in good Arts, and
true Religion, and the service of God, with Watchings, Prayers, and Hymns.

The next that prescribed orders was St Austin, borne Anno he being thirty
years old, obtained a garden without the walls of Hippo, where he begun this
order, assuming only twelve into his company. The first Monastery of them was
erected by William Duke of Guyen at Paris; and Anno 1200, they began to
flourish in Italy by the favor of John Duke of Mantua.

The third was Benedict, borne at Nursia in Vmbria, Anno 482, he gathered the
Monks of Italy together, and gave them a rule in writing; he lived till he had
seen twelve Monasteries filled with his Disciples: Their habit was a loose gown
of black, reaching down to their feet: their under garment was white woollen,
their legs booted, their Crowns shaued; their heads hooded. Of this order
have bin 52 Popes, 200 Cardinals, 1600 Archbishops, 4000 Bishops, and 50000
Saints, which have bin approved by the Church.

The fourth was St Francis, borne at Asis, he fell from M^rchandise to
Religion, going barefoot, and behauing himself very penitently; hereupon great
store of disciples following him, he gave them a rule wherein they are bound to
profess poverty and beggary; he caused them to be called Minors, to show their
humility; but now they are called Franciscans. This order was confirmed 1212.

Now concerning these orders of Friars, certain it is, that at their first
institution they were a people much reueren^ed for their holy life, as men that
for Christ's sake abandoned all the pompes and vanities of the world. And
questionless they then were a people altogether mortified; and who by their
very aspects would gain upon the affection of the hardest hearts; Sleidan com.
insomuch that not only mean men, but great personages also did desire to be
buried in a Friars weed: as Francis the 2d, Marquess of Mantua; Albertus Pius
an other Prince of Italy; and in later times the great Scholar Christopher
Longolius. But as Florus says of the civil wars between Pompey and Caesar,
Causa huius bell* eadem quae omnium, nimia felicitas: so may I say of these
cloystred Friars, the greatness of their wealth, which many on a superstitious
devotion bequeathed to their houses, brought them first into a neglect of their
former religiou^ and demure carriage: 2ly into a rechlesnesse of their credit
and actions: and lastly by consequence into contempt: so that there was not a
people under heaven that was more infamous in themselves, or more grossly
abused by others. Hence the vulgar saying of the people, When a Friar receives
the razor, the devil enters into him: and Friars wear crosses on their
breasts, because they have none in their hearts, with the like. Nay Sr Thomas
Moore, who in the Popes cause lost his head, sticks not to call them in his
Vtopia, Errones maximi; and that they were to be comprehended under the
statutes, made against vagabonds and sturdy beggars. Now to show both the
passions of respect and contempt of these Friars: There goes a tale how the
Lady Moore, S^ Thomas his wife, finding a Friars girdle, showed it with great
joy to her husband, saying; behold Sir Thomas, a step toward Heaven: to which,
he with a disdainful laugh made answer, that he feared that step would not
bring her a step higher. As for this retiredness and solitariness of life, so
it is, that many Kings, chiefly of our Kingdom, and especially under the Saxon
H^ptarchie, have left their thrones to enjoy it. And Barelay, whose excellent
endowments, shall never with me defend him from the stain of Apostasy, under
the person of Anaroestus, has (...) his Argenis, defended this kind of a
Prince his withdrawing himself from the world. Yet against examples only, to
oppose authority and practice; the Philosophers have defined a man to be (...).
a creature merely made for mutual converse: the Poets say, that Nascitur
indigne per quem non nascitur alter:
and the Jews which live abundantly in Rome and Italy, even abhor this
unsociable life; preferring a civil life far before a solitary; as being to
nature more agreeable; to man more profitable; and by consequence, to God more
acceptable. So having spoken thus much of Friars in general, I descend now to
particulars.

The particular orders of Friars.
Polyd. Virg. and Grimst.
1. Monks of Saint Hierome, begun by a worthy Father of the Church, so called.
Their roabe is a white Cassock, under a Tawny Cloak; there are many of them in
Spain; their chief house is Saint Bartholomew of Lupiena; they follow the
rule of Saint Austin. 4. Of Comald, begun in Italy, 1012, by Romoald of
Ravenna. Their first Monastery was built nigh unto Arezzo in the Duchy of
Florence, by one Comald, hence the name: they continue in their old
strictness; their Roabe is white; they follow the rule of Saint Benedict. 3.
Of Val d'Ombre, begun by John Gualbert a Florentine, 1040, who betaking
himself to the study of Religion, retired to a place in the Appennine called
Val Ombreux: his followers wear a smoakie habit, and follow the rule of Saint
Bennet. 4. The Carthusians, begun by Bruno a German Doctor of Divinity, and
six others, at the town Carthusia: his followers have at this day 93
Monasteries. They eat no flesh; live by couples; never meet but on Sundays;
labor with their hands, Watch, Pray, etc. their Roabe is white, with a short
Cape. 5. Of Cisteaux, instituted by Robert, Abbot of Molesme, who with 21 of
his religiousest Monks, retired to Cisteaux in Purgundie; where Bernard a great
Lord, became of their Order: who built and repaired 160 Abbeys. Their Roabe is
a white Cassock, girt with a girdle of wool; the rest black: they eat no
flesh; and follow Saint Bennet. 6. Carmelites, so called from Mount Carmel in
Syria, were insti^uted by Almene Bishop of Antioch, Anno 1122. They follow
Saint Basil, and were reformed by Eresba, a Spanish woman, she made them
certain constitutions, confirmed by Pope Pius 4th, Anno 1565. 7. Dominicke,
Preaching, or Blackfriars, instituted by Saint Dominicke a Spaniard; he put
himself in orders with 16 of his disciples 1206* then sent he his associats to
preach the Gospel even to the farthest parts of the world, which both they did,
and their successors since have done, in India and America. This order was
confirmed by Pope Innocent. 8. Celestines, instituted by one Peter a Samnite,
borne 1215 He always wore a chain of iron next his flesh, and over that a
shirt of hair. Pope Gregory the eleventh confirmed this rule: they follow
Saint Bennet, and took name from the said Peter, who for his sanctity was
chosen Pope, and called Cel^stine 5th. 9. The Minimes ordained 1450, by one
Francis a N^apolitan: he prosest austerity from his youth up, his followers
keep always a true Lenten fast, unless in case of sickness: their roabe is
dark Tawny, a hood of the same, hanging to their girdles. 10. Capouchins, so
called of their Cowle or Capouch, ordained by Matthew Basci of Ancona. Friar
Lewis his companion obtained of the Pope, the habit and rule of S. Francis,
1526: in the space of 42 years, they increased to 2240 associats, had 222
Monasteries, and were divided into fifteen Provinces. 11. Begging Friars follow
the rule of Saint Austin, they live idly up and down, and are fed by the
peoples alms, thinking that herein they do imitate our blessed Savior, and
his Apostles* they are bound to carry no money about them, nor more victuals
then will serve the present, but they may have a boy to do both for them,
without any scruple. 12. Crossed Friars, vulgarly called Crouched Friars, were
ordained by Cyriacus a Hierosolymitan Bishop, who showed unto Helena the place
where the Cross was hid: hence this order: which being almost decayed, Pope
Innocent the third repaired. Their roabe was of watchet color, and in their
hands they carried the figure of the Cross. 13. Jesuits, founded by Ignatius
Loyola, borne in Navarre, who being in his youth addicted to the wars, was
lamed in one of his legs, after which maime he betook himself to the study
of Religion, he framed his order consisting often: Pope Paul the third did
confirm it 1540, confining the number within sixty, which he after inla^ged ad
rifinitum. They are now the greatest Politicians, soundest scholars, and
chiefest vpholders of the Romish See; so that the only way to re-establish the
Romish Religion in any land, is to plant a College of Jesuits in it. To the
three vows of poverty, obedience, and chastity, common to all other orders,
Jesuits Catechism.
Ignatius at the institution of this, added the vow of Mission; whereby his
followers are bound to obey their General, or the Pope, without demanding any
reason, in all dangerous and hazardous attempts whatsoever; whether it be in
undertaking some tedious voyage for the propagation of the Romish Religion; or
the massacring of any Prince, whose life is an hinderance to their proceedings.
It is reported, that a Jesuit being in the midst of his Mass, which they call
the sacrifice of the altar, was sent for by Ignatius, to whom, leaving off his
Mass, he went immediately: Ignatius having no business wherein to employ him,
told him, that he only sent for him to try his obedience; and withal profanely
added, that Obedience was better taen sacrifice: and this is called, the blind
obedience of the Jesuits. To leave them then as they are, the greatest
disturbers of the quiet of Europe; I have heard a worthy Gentleman, now with
God, say; that till the Ie^uites were taken from the Church of Rome, and the
pee^ish Puritan Preachers out of the Churches of Great Britain, he thought
there would never be any peace in Christendom. 14. Anaehorets or Anchorets, so
called, because they use to live (...), retired from company. They are kept in
a close place, where they must dig their graves with their nails; badly clad,
and worse dieted: not to be pitied, because their restraint of liberty is
voluntary; yet to be sorrowed for, in that after such an earthly Purgatory,
they shall find instead of an Euge bone serve, a Quis haec quae^ivit de manibus
vestris?
I should much wrong the Friars, if I should deprive them of the company of
their Nuns: and therefore somewhat must be said of them also. Hospinian.
They are called in Latin Moniales, from the Greek word (...), because of their
solitary life: and amongst us, Ni^ines, from the Egyptian word Nonna: (for
Egypt in former times, was not meanly pestered with them) which signifies also
loneliness; a word in some of the barbarous Latins very frequent. Scholastica
the sister of Saint Benedict, was the first that collected them into companies,
and prescribed them orders. They are shaued as Monks are, and vow perpetual
virginity, which how well they perform, let Clemanges be judge; who tells
us, that puellam velare idem est ac public came ad scort^ndum exponere: And one
Robinson, which for a time lived in the English Nunnery at Lisbon, writes;
that he by chance found a hole in the wall of a Nunnery Garden, covered with
plaster, in which were many bones of young children, whom their unnatural
dammes had murdered, and thrown in there. Of these Nuns I will instance only
in two orders, viz: that of Saint Clare as being the strictest, and that of
Saint Brigit, as inioying most liberty.

St Clara was a Knights daughter of Asis, where Saint Francis was borne, with
whom she was contemporarie; and with whose austere life she was so affected,
that she forsook her fathers house, and followed him. Having learned her
lirrie of that Frier-monger, she composed an order of Religious Virgins, and
had it confirmed by Pope Honorius 3d, Anno 1225. Her followers profess
poverty, go barefoot, feed meanly, and are indeed too much straightned.

Saint Brigit was Queen of Swethland, and coming to Rome on devotion,
obtained of Pope Urban the 5th, that Friars and Nuns might in some places
live together, Anno 1372. For she being a widow and a woman, knew best without
question, what was good for both sexes; but little needed this cohabitation,
for they had formerly bin conjoined in carnal affections, though parted by
walls; neither were the Visitations so ^ruitlesse, but that the Nuns did
^ructifie by them. These Friars and Nuns, though they live under the same
roof, are prohibited to come one unto the other: the Foundresse so ordering
it, that the Nuns should lie uppermost, and the Fr^ers undermost; though
herein her pleasure be sometimes inverted. The Confessor also is denied
access into their chambers; but shriueth them through an iron grate, by which
his lodging is parted from my Lady Abbesses. And here lies the mystery of
iniquity. Robinson, whom I above named, tells us, that at the time of his
service in the English Nannery at Lisbone, he was showed a trick, by which this
uncharitable Grate, that seemed to keep the Friars from the company of their
sweet votaries; might be, and was upon such occasion, usually removed; and
free access opened into one another beds. This he writes of them, and for my
part I dare believe it of all the rest of this order.

And now I return to my Friars, who besides the maintenance which by their
Founders is allotted unto them; are kept in continual possibility of attaining
greater honors, if they continue dutiful to that See. For 1 there is not one
of them, which hops not to be the Prior of his Covent; 2 Provincial of his
order, in that Country where he lives; 3 the General of his order; 4 the
Generals are most likely to be Cardinals; 5 your Cardinals are in the ^ighest
possibility to be Popes; So firm and sweet a companion of man is hope, that it
being the last thing which leaves him, makes all toils supportable, all
difficulties conquerable.

The Papacy contains

THE COMMONWEALTH OF VENICE.
Hist. of Ita.
THE COMMONWEALTH OF VENICE contains La Marca Trevigiana, Friuli, Histria,
part of Dalmatia; the Islands Candie, Corfu, Cephalene Ithaca, Zant, Leucadia,
Cythera, and others of less note.

The length of the Venetian Territories, is above 1000 miles; but the breadth is
not answerable to the length.

The Venetians heretofore were worthy soldiers by sea and land, maintaining
wars with the Greek ^mperours, their neighbors, in Italy, and the Turks in
the Holy land. They are now more desirous to keep, then enlarge their
Dominions; and that by money and presents, rather then by true valor, and the
dint of the sword: which course succeeds so prosperously with them, that it
is observed by Machiavel, that whatsoever they loose by the battle, they
recover by treaty.

They were (as it is recorded) a people of the Lesser Asia, called Heneti,
Hist. of Ven.
and in that ten years siege of Troy, gave what aid they could to their
distressed confederates. But Troy being taken, and their King Pterilimene
slain, they chose rather to vndergee a voluntary exile, then the insolent
behavior of a new Conqueror. Upon this resolution they follow Antenor, and
sailing as the wind and seas favored, arrived with prosperous gale into Italy;
whose happiness herein, another wandering Trojan envied in this manner: Antenor
potuit, medijs illapsus Achivi^,
Illyricos penetrare sinus, atque intima tutu^
Regna Liburnorum.
Antenor rushing through the warlike Greeks,
Safely arrived through the Illyrian creekes,
Within Liburnia. Hist. of Ven.



In this part of Italy they first seated themselves, and there continued till
the report of the Huns design against Italy, drove many to avoid the storm
before it fell: and so coming into the Marshes and Islands, where Venice now
stands; fortified themselves as well as have could permit them, and there
began a a little Common wealth under Tribunes. But multitude of governors
being for the most part accompanied with confusion, they chose them a Duke,
Anno 709. Under these Dukes, they have gotten that great Dominion, which they
now enjoy. The Dukes authority is but small, as being in all things subject to
the Senate, and three officers called the Capi; without whose consent he may
not go out of the town, and by whom he is prescribed an order in his apparel:
So that he may be counted little better then an honorable slave. His revenue is
as little as his authority, he being allowed out of the common treasury, but
40000 Ducats in a year. The people of this City are either Gentlemen, or
Artificers and Commons. The first are the progeny of those who first began
to settle here; the latter such whom after-occasions induced to make here their
dwelling. The Gentlemen they have in such respect, that to make a man a
Gentleman of the city, is the greatest honor they can bestow upon the best
deseruer. Henry the 3d of France taking this city in his way out of Poland,
thought himself graced with this attribute: which they are very dainty and
sparing of; it being the glory which they vouchsafe to impart to such
Commanders of their own, and Ammbass^dours of other Princes, as have well
deserved it To compare it to a thing ordinary amongst us, it is like the
custom in our Universities, of creating him a Master of Arts, who either is a
wel-doer, or a Messenger of some special business, or glad tidings unto us.
Now, a^ Otho in Tacitus said to the Praetorian soldiers, Princeps e Senatu
oritur, Sena^us e vobis: so out of these Gentlemen are chosen the Senat^rs, out
of them the Duke. His election is in this manner. In the vacancie of the place,
Contarenus.
all the Gentry above 30 years of age are assembled. So many as meet, cast
their names into a Pot, and in another are just so many bals, of which, 30 only
are guilt. The^ a child draws for each, till the 30 guilt ones be drawn; for
which 30 the child draws again the second time out of an other Pot, that
has only 9 guilt balls. The nine so drawn, nominate forty; out of which forty
are 12 again selected by the same kind of lot. These twelve denominate 25; out
of which 25, are n^ne again by lot set apart. These nine nominate 45. who are
by lot again reduced unto eleven. These eleven choose forty one of the best and
chiefest of the Senators. These forty one, alter an o^th severally, to choose
whom they judge worthiest; write in a scrol every one whom he best likes. The
scrolls are mingled together, and then drawn: the fitness of the persons thus
drawn, is discussed: and he that has most voices above 25, is the man whom
they pronounce to be elected; and adjudge with due solemnities to be created
their Duke. By the like kind of lottene do they choose Gentlemen into the
Senate House, and make public officers. Insomuch that many suppose the
Venetian Repub^ique, to be a very model of Platoes old plat-^orme.

Hist. of Ven.
This city was begun the 25 day of March about noone, A^ 421: It is built upon
72 Islands, distant from the maine Land five miles, defended against the fury
of the Sea, by a bank, extending 60 miles in length; through which in s^uen
places there is passage broken for boats, but no way for vessels of bigge^
burden, saving at Malamuc^o, and the castles of Lio, strongly fortified, so
that it is impossible to be taken, but by an enemy, whose army can stretch 150
m^les in compass.

The City is in compass eight miles, and has for convenience of passage 4000
Bridges, and very near 12000 boats. The buildings are fair, and adorned with
glass windows, an ornament not common in Italy. Hist. of Ital,
Here are supposed to be 200 houses, fit to lodge any king whomsoever; most of
which do stand on the Grand Canale. They have an Arsenall, in which are kept
200 Galleys, nigh to which are houses stored with Mast^, Sails, and other
tacklings: so that they can speedily set out a Navy. In their Magazin of
war, they have armor sufficient for 100000 Soldiers; amongst which are 1000
coats of plate garnished with gold, and covered with velvet, so that they are
fit for any Prince in Christendom. From so base and abject a beginning, is
this City grown to be the chief Bulwark of Europe. She is also accounted
Lady of the Adriatique Sea, to which she is every Ascension day espowsed, by
casting a Ring into it. This privilege was granted by Pope Alexander the
third, who persecuted by Frederick Barbarossa, fled to Venice, S^bastian C^ani
then being Duke; who for his sake ^ncountered Otho the Emperors son, Hist.
of Ven*
vanquished him, restored the Pope, and for a reward was honored with this
espowsall. The Patron of the City is St Mark, whose body they report to have
bin brought from Alexandria, and is here buried in the fairest Church of the
City, called St Marks, which is said to be the goodliest and richest Church
in the world. For it is built throughout with Mosaique work, of which works
they vaunt them^elues to be the authors. Now Mosaique or Marqueterie ( Musaea
Musaica or Musica the Latins call it) is a most curious work wrought of
stones of diverse colors and diverse mettles, into the shape of knots, flowers,
and other devices, with that excellency of cunning; that they seem all to be
one stone, and rather the work of nature then art. As for the ^urniture of
this Church, ^t ^arre exceeds the building, for sumptuousness and beauty.

The chief policy whereby this Commonwealth has so long subsisted in an
Aristocracie, is 1, the exempting their citizens from the wars, and hi^ing
others in their places: by whose death the Commonwealth sustaineth the less
loss. 2ly The entertaining of some foreign Prince for their General, whom
after the wars ended they presently discard; by which course they avoid
faction and servitude, which were like to happen, if they should employ in that
service any of their own people; who by his virtue and courage might perchance
make himself their Prince. The Laws also of this City, permit not the
younger sons of the Nobility or Gentry to marry; Hist. of It.
least the number increasing, should diminish the dignity; howsoever they
permit them unlawful pleasures, and for their sakes allow public Stews.

Europe is the head of the world, Italy the face of Europe, and Venice the eye
of Italy: it is the fairest, strongest, and most active part of that powerful
body: so that it seems, that in the subversion of the last Monarchy, the
Roman Genius made a Pythagoricall transmigration into Venice; whose peace has
procured the plenty, and whose wars the peace of all Christendom. It is
animated with all the virtues of old Rome, but if I conjecture aright, knit
with a more constant temper; so that the present Rome, is but the carcass of
the old, of which she retains nothing but her ruins; and the cause of them,
her sins.

Thus much of the City; the chief Provinces are,
1. MARCA TREVIGIANA is bounded on the South, with the river Po, Hist. of Ven
on the West with the Duchy of Millaine, on the East with Friuli and the
Gulf of Venice, and on the North with Tirolis. The chief city is Treuiso,
whence the country is named. It has been taken by the Venetians, and lost
again diverse times; but was finally conquered Ano 1390, or thereabout, Antonio
Vermero being Duke of Venice. 2 Padua, formerly called Patauium, was built by
Antenor, whose Tomb is still here to be shown. The University was established
Ano 1220, famous for Physicians, who have here a garden of Simples, and for the
birth of Livie, Zabarell, and Maginus. It was much renowned in former times for
the humanity of the men, and chastity in the women: which was so eminent and
famous, that As chaft as one of Padua, grew into a proverb. Hereunto alludeth
Martial, speaking of his own lascivious writings: Tu quoque nequitias nostri
lususque libelli,
Vda puella leges, sis Patauina licet.
Young maids my wanton li^es will long to see,
And read them over, though Patauines they be.
This Cit^y after much vicissitude of fortune, fell to the power of the
Venetians, with all her territories, being in compass 180 miles, Ortelius.
Anno 1406, Michael Steno being then Duke. 3 Vicenza won about the same time
with Padua. 4 Brescia, the second City for bigness and beauty in all
Lombardy: it is also the seat of an Archbishop, who is an Earl, a Marquess,
and a Duke. Her territories are in length 100, in breadth 50 miles, which the
Citizens together with their freedom bought of Otho the Germane Emperor: and
lost to the Venetians, Francis Foscara being Duke Ao 1434 5 Verona, quasi Vere
vna, or Brenona, because as some will it was built by Brennus; is seated on the
Athesis, and is the first city of the second rank of Cities in Italy. It
boasts of an Amphitheatre, able to contain 80000 people; and the birth of
Catullus: the Territories are 65 miles in length, and 40 in breadth; within
which is the mountain Baldus where Physicians use to gather medicinal herbs.
7 Briscello, or Brixellum famous for the death of Otho the Roman Emperor,
Tacitus
who here slew himself. For having received news that his Army was by Valens
and Cacina, Captains to Vitellius, unfortunately vanquished; chose rather to
make a way himself, then that his Country should for his sake be forced
again to renew the war. When he was dead and laid upon the funeral pile,
many of the Soldiers slew themselves; not upon fear of punishment, nor as
being guilty of any crime: but for the great love they bare to him, and to
follow his honorable example. So we may truly say of this Otho, as he said of
himself, Alij diutius imperium tenuerunt, nemo tam fo^titer reliquit. 8
Bergomo, the people whereof speak the worst language of any in Italy. 9 Este,
whence came the family D'Este, late Dukes of Ferrara, 10 Crema, a strong sort

whom Ao 1125 Pope Honorius the 2d sent Legate into England, to dissuade our
Clergy from marriage. A Convocation was called presently after his arrival;
in which the Legate having made an accurate speech in praise of single life,
and how fit it was that Ministers should live separat from the cares of the
world; was the night following taken in adultery.

The principal rivers are Athesis. 2 Addua. 3 Ollius. And Brenta, famous for
her adjoining Palaces.

2. FRIVLI, formerly called Forum Iulij, is environed with Histria, the Alps,
Trevigiana, and the Adriatique; the length of it is 50 miles, and the breadth
as much. The chief cities are 1 Aquilegia, once 12 miles in circuit: it is
seated on Natisco, was razed by Attila and his Hunnes, and is now ill inhabited
by reason of the neighborhood of Venice. Capitol.
This town endured that famous siege against Maximinus for the weal of the
Commonwealth of Rome, and her Emperors Maximus and Balbinus. In whose cause
the Citizens persisted so resolutely faithful, that they bereaved the women
(willing for the common good to loose so invaluable an ornament) of their
hair, to make bow-strings. Neither did this pious and hearty constancy to the
State want its wished effect; for they beheld the Tyrant headless under their
walls, and saw the Metropolis of the world preserved by their loyalty. After
the death of the old Tyrant, the Soldiers and people lay hands also upon his
children, and put them to the sword: Of which cruelty being asked the reason,
they replied, that! pessimi canis ne catulus esset relinqu^n^us. 2 Tergestum or
Tr^ist, close to the Sea. 3 Gorritia. 4 Palma, a town built by the Venetians
1583, and is best fortified of any in Italy. 5 Cividad d' Austria built by
Julius Caesar, and called Iulium; whence the Province was named Forum Iulij: it
having before been called Iapidia, of Iapis an Aetolian, that planted here.

The chief Rivers are 1 Risanus. 2 Lizonsus. 3 Natisco.

Hist. of It.
At the beginning of the Venetian Commonwealth, Friuli was one of the 4
Dukedomes founded by the Lombards (the other three being Turino, Spoleti,
Benevento) Luitprandus one of the Dukes envying the Venetians increase of
dominion, did make war against them, which ended in the loss of his
country; ever since subject to the Venetians.

3 Histria, Boterus.
is environed with the Sea, Friuli, and Carniola. The compass of it is 200
miles, the air so unwholesome, that the Venetians were compelled to hire people
to dwell there. The chief Towns are 1 Cape d' Istria, or Iustinopolis, by
Pliny called Aegide. Sleid. Com.
Of this town Vergerius was Bishop; a man who^ many Popes employed in Germany
against Luther. In which negotiation he behaved himself so fully to the
content of those that employed him, that Paul the 3d intended Anno 1541, to
have made him Cardinal, had not some who envied him this honor, accused him
of Lutheranisme. He to purge himself began to write a book entitled
Against the Apostata's of Germany: in the pursuit whereof pondering Luthers
reasons, he became of his opinion; which once known, he was driven from
Iustinople. He submitted himself and his cause to the Fathers at Trent but
could not get a hearing. Thence he went to the D. of Mantua, from him to the
State of Venice; but no where finding protection, he retired into Rhetia, and
there preached the Gospel, till Christopher Duke of Wirtenberg, Ao 1548 placed
him in his Vniver^^tie of Tubing, and there allowed him a sufficiency of
maintenance. Volaterr.
It was built by Justinius son to Justinian the Emperor, as a fortress
against the incursions of the barbarous people. 2 Pola built by the Colchians
at their first coming hither; the name in their language importing as much as
banishment. It abutteth on Sinu^ Fanaticus, or Golf^ Queuero. 3 Parenzo. 4
Portulae. 5 Rubinum. and 6 ^^on^ona.

The principal Rivers are Phormio (now called Risanus) parting Histria from
Friuli. 2 Quietus formerly Naupactus. 3 Arsia.

It is recorded that the Histrians were a people of Colchis, who being sent by
King Aetas to pursue Jason and the Argonauts, were driven (...) this Gulf:
where either for fear of the Kings anger, or not d^r^ng to venture their weak
vessel, to so long a voyage; they staid in this Country. Thus lived in
freedo^e till the growth of the Roman Empire; after whose decay, they regained
their liberty till by Pryracie molesting the Venetians, Hist. of Ven.
they lost many of their Towns to Duke Peitro Candiano Anno 938: and the whole
country was made tributary by the valor of Duke Henry Gondolo, about the
year 1200. The other parts of this Empire, being no part of Italy, shall be
handled in due place.

Seldom.
The chief orders of Knighthood in this Republike are, 1 Of S^ Mark, began in
the year 1330, and renewed Ao 1562. The Knights are to be of the noble sort:
the word, Pax tibi Marce. 2 Of the Glorious Virgin, instituted by Bartholmew of
Vicenza 1232. Their charge is to defend widows, and Orphans; and to procure
the peace of Italy. It was approved by Pope Viban the 4th Anno 1262. The Arms
are a purple Cross, between certain Stars; a white roabe over a ruslet
cloak.

The revenues of this Commonwealth are 4 Millions of Ducats, which they raise
with such taxes, that Christians generally live better under the Turk, then
under the Venetian.

THE DVKEDOME OF FLORENCE.
THE DVKEDOME OF FLORENCE contains the greater part of Tuscany; being parted
from Genoa by the Magra, and the strong Town Sarezana, belonging to the
Genocys on the West; from Romagna and Ancona, by the Appennine on the North; by
the Pisseo on the East; and the Tirrhene Sea on the South. Freigius.
It was called Thuscanie, from (...) sacrificing, and Tirrhenia from Tirrhenus,
son to Atis king of Lydia, who planted here a Colonie. The first King was
Tarquon Prisons, in the year of the world 2550; the last was Turenus Ceso;
after whose death the Romans took it, Anno M. 3682.

The chief City is Florence, seated nigh to the confluence of Arnus and
Chianus. It so abounds with goodly buildings, both for divine and civil
uses, and has so many straight and clean stre^ts; Boterus.
that Charles the Archduke was wont to say, it was a City to be scene on holy
days only. It is in compass 6 miles; was built by L. Sylla that bloody
Dictator; and was made a Colonie by Augustus, Antony, and Lepidus the
Triumviri; and called Florentia a situ slo^e^ti. It was razed by the Lombards,
and reedified by Charles the great; to whose successors it long time continued
faithful: but at last by the example of other Cities, it began to shift for
it self, and finally bought her absolute liberty of Rodolphus for 6000 Crowns.

The Medices whose posterity are now Dukes hereof, were in the free state
reckoned among the popular Nobility Match. hist. of Flor.
; which were such of the Nobles, as to make themselves capable of the City
Magistracies, had in a manner degraded themselves, becoming part of the
Communalty. About the year ^410, John de Medices stoutly maintaining the
peoples, liberty against the Nobility; was by the Commons exceedingly honored
and enriched: so that he had not only a great party, but almost a Sovereignty
in the City. To him succeeded Cosmo his son, a man worthy amongst the
worthiest: he died in the year 1464: during which time he had much reformed
the government of the State, and enlarged the territories thereof with the
conquest of Borgo San Sepulchro, Casentino, etc. To Cosmo succeeded Peter de
Medices, whose whole time was spent against such factions, as at home were
raised against him. He dying Ao 1472, lest his whole power and estate, with a
greater measure of his fathers virtues, to his two sons Lorenzo and Julian
After his death, the people inclined much to one of the fam^lie of the Sodermi,
a man of very plausible behavior. But he knowing that new houses, as they are
easily honored, so are they quickly abandoned; conferred all the dependencies
cast upon him, upon these two young men of the Medices, as being descended from
a family which had long governed the City. Against these two, the Pazzi a
potent house in Fl^rence, conspired, and at Mass they slew Julian; but Lorenzo
escaped; the blows which were stroke at him being received by one of his
servants, whom two days before he had delivered out of prison. For this fact
the Pazzi were hang^d at the Pall^ce window, together with the Archbishop of
P^sa, who had been of the conspiracy. To revenge the death of this Bishop,
Pope Paul the 2d excommunicated the Florentines; and Ferdinand King of Naples
warred upon them. Lorenzo to divert this mischief went in person to Naples;
where he grew so much into the good liking of the king, that there was a
perpetual league made between them. After his death Ao 1492, his son Peter
having very improvidently delivered Pisa and Ligorne, Gui^^iard.
with other pieces, to the French King; was together with his whole family
banished. John di Medices being Pope by the name of Lee the 10^ restored again
his family; who not long after his death, were again exiled. This disgrace
Iulio di Medices son to the above named Julian, and Pope of Rome by the name
of Clement the 7th, not enduring; procured Charles the fifth to besiege it;
which request was granted; and the City after two years resistance, yielded.
The Emperor gave it to Alexander Medices (grandchild to Peter by his son
Laurence) Ao 1571. And he to restrain the insolences of the people, built a
strong cittadell in the town. P. Iovius
This Alexander was a man addicted to all kind of uncleanness, insomuch as
he was slain by Laurence his cosen, who instead of calling, after the fact
committed, the people to take arms for their liberty; fearfully fled out of
the City, and posted toward Venice. Before the people had notice of this
accident, the friends of the Medices consulting together, made choice of Cosmo
di Medices, then about 18 years old, for their Prince. This Cosmo being an
excellent statesman, and a brave leader, so swaied the affairs of Italy: that
Philip the 2d of Spain, to be assured of his freindship, gave him the Signe^ry
of Su^^a, out of which he had lately driven the French. Pius the 4th Anno 1560
would have crowned this Cosmo king of Tuscanie. But Philip of Spain thwarted
that intent, as loath to have in Italy any more kings then himself. After in
the year 1570 Pius the fifth crowned the said Cosmo in the Court of Rome, with
the title of Great Duke of Tuscanie, for him and his heirs for ever. In the
new Dukes Coro^et he caused to be engraven these words. Pius quintus pont:
maxiob eximiam dilectionem and rel gionis catholicae zelum, praecipuumque
iustitiae studium, donavit. Thus forward were these Popes to honor this
family. One of Duke Cosmo's successors since entreated a succeeding Pope that
he might be created King of Tuscanie: but the Romish Caliph not liking so
Lordly a title, answered that he was content He should be a king in Tuscany,
but not king of Tuscany: a Scholler-like distinction, but not well taken. The
City has diverse times been ruinated by the factions of the Bondelmonti and
Vborti. 2 The Anudei and Donati. 3 The Guelsi and Gibellini. Here were borne
three Monsters, viz: 1 Alexander de Medices, that dispoyled Florence of her
liberty, the fairest City of Italy 2 Katherine de Medices, that ruined France,
the fairest kingdom of Europe. 3 Nicholas Machiavell, Recorder of this Town,
whose politickes have poisoned Europe, the fairest part of the whole world.

The second City is Pisa, built by the Pisae, a people of Elis in Greece;
Stephanus
who following old Nestor from Troy, were by the violence of wind and sea,
driven into the mouth of Arnus, where they built this town, calling it after
their own n^me. After the fall of the Roman Monarchy, it grew so strong; that
at one time the Citizens waged war with the Venetians and Genoys. They were
Masters of the Baleares, Corsica, and Sardinia: but finally being discomfited
by the Genowaies, near to the Island Gigli^; they submitted themselves to
Charles the 4th. Not long after it was taken by John Galeas, the first of the
Vicounts which was Duke of Millaine. Ao 1404. Gabriel Maria Vicount, sold them
to the Flo^entines, from whose command they by violence delivered themselves.
The Florentines besieged them, and brought them to that extremity of hunger,
that they were almost all starved: yet such was the humanity of their
besiegers, that when they entered the Town; instead of weapons every man
carried victuals* to beget as it were new life in that rebellious people. This
victory the Florentines got by the valor and conduct of Sr John Hawkwood, whom
the Italians call Giovanni di Aguto; who being first a Tailor in Essex,
afterward served Edward the th^rd in his French wars, where he was knighted:
and when upon the peace concluded after the battle of Poycters, he wanted
employment; he entered with his regiment into Italy, and put himself into the
pay of the Florentines then in war with this City; who for his valor have
honored him with a fair tomb and monument. When Charles the 8th went into
Italy, the Pisans again revolted; and were no^ without much labor
reas-subiected.

The third City is Sienna, bu^lt by Brennus, who did there put his old sickly
men to so^ourne, and called it Sena. Here was borne Ae^^as Sylvius, called
afterward Pope Pius the second; and Francis Piccol^mmey, after Pope ^ius the
third: Her Territories contained Orbitello, ^ienza, Soana, and 26 other walled
Towns: To this Commo^wealth also belonged the haven of Telamon, and the
Lordship of Plombino. To it also appertained the Peninsula called Mont^
Argentorato, enriched with mines of silver, and abundance of marble. This last
is in the possession of the Duke of Florenco, but T^lamon and Plombino are
still kept by the Spaniard, the better to keep the great Duke at his devotion.
This Commonweal bought its liberty of the Emperor Rodolphus: Afterward it
^ell into the hands of the Spaniards, then of the French; and was sold to the
Florentine by the Spa^iards, Anno 1558, in consideration of the money already
received, and the assistance in future expected, from Cosmo di Medices. This
Cosmo depriving the people of all armor as well for defense as ^ffence,
altered the government, bereaved them of the common liberty; and was the first
Prince, that after the constitution of the free Commonwealth, ever had absolute
dominion in the City: The Spaniards and French never ruling here as Lords; but
called in according to the factions then bearing most sway, to drive out one
another.

Hist. of It.
The fourth City is Pistoya, where first begun the quarrel of the Neri and
Beanchi, as also that tedious and bloody faction of the Guelfi and G^ibellini:
these latter so called of two Dutchmen Brothers, whereof Guelf thought the
Pope, and Ghibell the Emperor to be more worthy, in which quarrel they slew
each other, dispersing their cause throughout all Italy. These Ghibellines were
so hateful to the Popes, that on an Ash Wednesday, when according to the Romish
institution, the Pope being to cast Ashes on the heads of the Cardinals, was to
say, Memento o homo quod cinis es, and in cinerem converteris: seeing a
Ghibelline amon^st the rest, transported with rage, he said unto him, Memente ^
homo quod Ghibellinus es, and cum Ghibellinis morieris.

The other Cities of the better sort are 1 Massa, famous for her Quarries of
white marble. 2 Volaterra where Rodolphus Volaterra was borne. 3 Arezzo bought
of Lewis of Aniou, the Popes Vicegerent in Tuscany, for 40000 Florens. 4
Cortona, seated under the Appenine, and sold by Ladislaus of Naples. 5 Carara.
6 Borgo San Sepulchro added to the Signeurie of Florence by the valor of Cosmo
di Medices, Match. hist. of Flor.
the first of that name. 7 Liuorne, a famous haven town, seated at the mouth
of the river Arnus. It once belonged to the Genoyse, till Thomazo Fregosa for
120000 Ducats sold it to the Florentines. It is by the care of the great Duke
so well manned and fortified, that this town together with Luca, Zara in
Dalmatia, and Canea in Crete, are accounted four of the strongest Cities in
Christendom; Cities I say, not Castles; the Castles of Millaine, and
Stockholme in Swethland, being reputed the strongest holds in the world.

The length of this Dukes dominion is 260 miles, the breadth in some place as
much; in which compass live a people pleasant unconstant, sociable, of an
accurate wit, and pure language. Not only the Subjects, but the Duke himself,
is wholly devoted to Merchandise; whereas in England and France, he loses the
privilege of a Noble man, who does buy or s^ll in way of trading. The Duke
uses here also to buy up almost all the Corn in the Country at his own
price; and sell it again as dear as he list; forbidding any Corn to be sold,
till his be all vented.

The principal order of Knighthood in this Dukedom, Seldom*
is of St Stephan, instituted by Cosmo di Medices 1561, because on St Stephans
day, being the 6 of August, he won the battle of Mariana. Pius the 4th
confirmed it. Their Roabe is Chaml^t a Cross Gules on their left side: they
are to be nobly borne, of the Romish Church, and have liberty to mar^y. This
order was proposed against the Turk^ the supreme master of it, being the Duke
of Florence. Other orders are commonly simple, this is mixed, as being partly
religious, partly honourarie.

What the Revenewes were in the free state, I cannot easily determine. That
they were very great is manifest, in that having in those five years during,
which they warred against the Duke of Millaine spent 3 millions and a half of
Florens; their treasury was so far from wanting, that the next year they
beseiged and endangered the state of Luca. Now, since the altering of the State
to a Duchy, and the addition of the territory and town of Siena, the yearly
revennue is about a Million and a half of Ducats.

THE DVKEDOME OF MILLAINE.
The DVKEDOME OF MILLAINE has on the East Mantua and Parma, on the South
Liguria, on the North Trevigiana, on the West Peidmont. It stands wholly in
Lombardy, which for its wondrous fertility, was styled the Garden of Italy.
Lombardy was known to the Ancients by the name of Gallia Cisalpina: Gallia, as
being inhabited of the Gauls; Cisalpina, because it lay on this side the
Alp^s. It was also called Gallia Comata because of the long hair of their
heads: and afterward Longobardia from the long hair of the peoples beards. It
was by the river Po divided into Cispadanam and Transpadanam, and comprehended
the Dukedomes of Mantua and Parma; the Provinces of Romandiola, Trevigiana, and
Peidmont; together with this Duchy, which then by a peculiar name was called
Insubria.

The chief rivers are, 1 Padus. 2 Ad^a. 3 Ollius. 4 Ticinu^* and 5 Lacus
Larius, vulgarly called, Lago di Como, 50 miles in length.

The chief cities are 1 Pavia or Papia on the flood Ticinus, made an
University 1361, by Charles the 4th: united to M^llaine by John Galeazo the
first Duke: and famous for the battle in which Francis the first, was taken
prisoner by Charles the fifth 1525. 2 Lodi. 3 Alexandria, now a Town of great
strength, formerly a poor small Village named Roboretum. Munster.
The new name and greatness must be ascribed to the often overthrows of
Millaine by Frederick Barbarossa; the people whereof at the several
destruction of their City, retired to this Town; calling it for Pope
Alexander the thirds sake, whose part they then took against the Emperor,
Tacitus.
by this new name. 4 Cremona, built in the first year of the second Punicke
war, and burnt to the ground by Vespasians Soldiers, after the defeat of
Vitellius forces: which defeat was given under the walls of this Town. When
Antonius, Vespasians General first after his victory entered into it: he went
to a Bath to wash away the sweat and blood from his body; where finding the
water some what too cold, he said by chance, that it should anon be made
hotter. Which words the Soldiers applying to their greedy desires set ^ire on
the Town, and spent four days in the sacking of it. By the encouragement of
Vespasian it was again reedified; and i^ now famous for her high Tower; from
which grew the byword, Vna turris in Cremona, vnus Petrus in Roma, vnus Portus
in Ancona. 5 Como, seated on a Lake so named, in which both the Plinies were
borne. 6 Millain a fair Town, and the biggest of all Lombardy; having a
Castle so strongly fortified, with natural and artificial ramparts, Hist. of
It.
that it is deemed impregnable. It is a City very populous containing 200000
persons; and of great trade, here being private shops equalling the public
storehouses of other places: whence the people are so rich, that the wife of
every Mechanicke will flaunt it in her silks and Taffataes. This City is said
to have been built by the Gauls 359 years before Christ; it is 7 miles in
circuit, and honored with an V^iversity, Munster.
wherein flourished Hermolaus Barbarus, Cali^s Rhodiginus, and Cardanus. Here
(say some) St Barnabie taught Divinity, and here S. Ambrose was Bishop.

This Town continued Imperial after the overthrow of the Lombards, till the
time of Frederick Barbarossa, 1161, from whose obedience, in behalf of Pope
Alexander the third, it revolted The Emperor diverse times destroyed the City,
the people hereof still ministering fresh occasions. Beatrix the Emperors wife,
coming to see the Town, was by the irreuerent people, first imprisoned; and
then most barbarously handled. For they placed her on a Mule with her face
toward the tail, which she was compelled to use instead of a bridle; and when
they had thus shown her to all the town, they brought her to a gate, and
kicked her out. To revenge this wrong the Emperor besieged and forced the
Town; and adjudged all the people to dye, save such as would undergo this
ransom. Between the buttocks of a skittish Mule, a bunch of Figs was
fastened; and such as would live, must with their hands bound behind, run
after the Mule, till with their teeth they had snatched out one or more of the
Figs. This condition, besides the hazard of many a sound kick, was by most
accepted and performed. Since which time, the Italians when they intend to
scoff or disgrace one, use to put their thumb between two of their fingers
and say Ecco, la fico: which is counted a disgrace answerable to our English
custom, of making horns to that man whom we suspect to be a Cuckold. After
this, this City again rebelled; and was by the same Emperor leuel'd with the
ground, the walls pulled down, and all the platform of the City ploughed up
and sown with salt; that being the Emblem of a town never in possibility to
be reedified. This notwithstanding Millaine was again rebuilt, and the Pope by
the Millanoys and Venetians help, had the better of the Emperor; to whom the
Pope enjoined a service in the Holy land. At this time, seeing the Emperor
troubled with wars, the people began a Commonwealth, which continued about 56
years; when the Visconti, a potent fam^ly, Hist. of It.
usurped the Dominion. The first which took on him this authority was Otho,
who being also Lord of Angerena, surnamed himself Visconti, quasi bis Comes.
The first of this family which obtained the title of Duke, was John called
Galeazo, because at his birth the Cocks crew more then was ordinary: who for
his dignity paid to the Emperor Wenceslaus 100000 Crowns. This John so
increased his dominions, that he was Lord of 29 Cities and their territories,
and died going to Florence, that he might be crowned king of Tuscany. He left
one daughter married to Lewis Duke of Orleans; and two sons: John Maria the
elder, was slain by the people; and Philip Maria succeeded in Millain. He
dying, left one illegitimate daughter called Blanch, married to Francisco
Sforza a brave Soldier; and in his will named Alphonso of Arragon his heir*
but in vain, for Sforza was possessed of the City. In his line it continued,
till the coming of Lewis the twelfth into Italy; who was King of France, son
to Charles Duke of Orleans, son to Lewis a^oresaid, and Valentina daughter to
John the first Duke. His Competitours were the King of Arragon, alleging the
testament of Duke Philip, the Sforzaes in possession and the Emperor
Maximili^n, who pretended an escheat for want of heirs male. Against these in
several Lewis prevailed, as also did Francis the first his next successor:
but when the right of Spain and the Empire met together in Charles the fifth,
then was King Francis taken prisoner, and for his release, was glad to release
all title to Naples and Millain. A release long before endeauored by some
French Politicians, because the keeping of this Duchy, or its title, had
brought such damage to that Crown: and as much opposed by Chancellor Prat;
because it both kept the French in a continual and certain discipline of
war, and served as a purgation of idle and superfluous people.
Notwithstanding this release, king Francis renewed the war again; during
which the poor Millancys endured all the wretchedness imaginable in a country
so banded for, and tossed from Potentate to Potentate. Antonio di Lena, the
French governor in Millain, to provide for the pay of his Soldiers, had
drawn into his hands all the victual of the City, which he sold at his own
price; which many poor people having no means to give died in the streets.
Yet this sufficed not. His Soldiers he quartered in the City; every of which,
used as often as they wanted money, to chain their hosts and then ransom
them. Such as upon this usage fled the City, had their goods confiscate: the
Nobles went but poorly arrayed; the principal places of the City were
ouergrowne with Nettles and Brambles. In this miserable estate it continued,
till Charles having totally driven thence the French, restored it to Francis
Sforzi brother to the l^st Duke Maximilian; and son to that Lodowicke* who
most improuidently for his own private ends, had first taught the French the
way into Italy. After the death of this Francis, being the last of the
Sforzaes, the Emperor entered as Lord of Millaine, which his successors yet
keep: I mean his successors in Spain, not the Empire.

Hist. of It.
Of 29 Cities under Millain, there now remain but 9; yet is this the prime
Dukedom of Christendom, containing 300 miles in circuit, and affording the
reuenew of 800000 Ducats unto the King of Spain.

The Arms are A, a Serpent B, crowned O, in his gorge an infant G: This coat
was the ensign of a Saracen, whom Otho the first of the Visconti, overcame in
the Holy land.

THE DVKEDOME OF MANTVA.
The DVKEDOME OF MANTVA has on the East Romagna, on the West Millaine, on the
North Trevigiana, on the South Parma and Placentia. To this belongs the
^ukedome of Montferrat, seated in the Southeast part of Peidmont, whose chief
Cities are 1 Alba, once called Alba Pompei^, where Pertinax the Roman Emperor
was borne; who being of base and obscure ancestors, betook himself to the
wars, in Britain and other places: In which having gotten great reputation,
he was by Letus and Electus, the deliuerers of Rome from the Tyranny of
Commodus; called to the Empire. But being over zealous to redress the
corruption then reviving in the State, he was by the Praetorian Soldiers,
loathing now their Princes for their virtues, more then formerly they did for
their vices; barbarously murdered; and the Imperial dignity sold to Iulianus,
for 25 Sestertiuns a man. 2 Cas^la St Vas, vulgarly called St Vas, new built by
Frederick the first Duke of Mantua; who married the daughter and heir of
Gulielmus Pal^^logus Marquess of Montserrat Ao 1539. 3 Nicaea or Niza: and 4
Isola.

The chief cities of this Dukedom of Mantua, are 1 Mirabella, 2 Lucera, 3
Cap^iana, 4 Modena, once a Town belonging to Ferrara, and by Clement the 8th
given with her spacious ^erritories, unto Caesar d'Este, natural son unto
Hercules d'Este, last Duke of Ferrara. It is now by marriage allied to Mantua.
This town was of old called Mutina, and is famous for the first battle between
Antonie and Augustus: this latter being by the Lords and people of Rome, Dion.
made head of the League against Antony the common enemy. Augustus was then
aged but 18 years, and therefore he refer^ed the execution of the war to
Hirtius, and Pansa, then Consuls. The fortune of the day was so equally shared,
that Antonie lost the field, and the Consuls their liue^* Leaving Augustus a
headless army, into whose favor when he had wrought himself, he presently
poasted to Rome, and made himself Consul. 5 Reggio, for the possession of
which, there have bin so many discontents, and open war between the old Dukes
of Ferrara, and the Popes of Rome. 6 Cuneto, 7 Mantua, a very strong Town,
environed on three sides with a water, Hist. of Ita.
being a quarter of a mile broad; on the fourth with a wall. It is seated on a
river, which coming from Lago di G^rda, runs into the Po. In this City was
held that Council, wherein it was decreed, that the choosing of the Popes
should belong only to the Conclaue of Cardinals: A prerogative which formerly
belonging to the Emperors, was first given away by Constantine the 4th, Anno
621: but re-taken by Charles the Great, and now confirmed to the Cardinals,
1063. In this town Virgil was borne, Mantua Virgilio gaudet.

This* City was taken from the Emperors Vicegerents, by that brave Virago,
Matilda; who dying without issue, gave this Town, and all other her
possessions, to the Roman Prelates: whose Legates ruled this Town, till the
Poledroni, a great family, took on them the government, 1220: from these it was
taken by the family of Gonzaga, Anno 1308. These Lords mightily augmented their
Dominions, which caused the Emperor Sigismund to create Lord John Francisco,
Marquess of Mantua. From a Marquisate, it became a Dukedom, in the time of
M^rquesse Fr^dericke, created Duke by Charles the 5, Anno 1^^4, the present
Duke is Francis Gonzaga. As for the Country of Montferrat; Bergomensis
it is so called a monte ferrato, some mountain here stored with iron; or else
a monte seraci, from the fertility ^f the mountains here being. It is
environed with the Apponine hills, Millaine and the river Tanarus; which river
springing out of these hills about Barceis, a town of the Marqussate of
Saluzzes; looses it self in the Po, somewhat beneath the Pauie. In this round
are some towns belonging to Millaine, as Aste, Alexandria, etc. This country
was made a Marquisate by Oth^ the 2d, 985; and given to his son in law
Alaramus: and since the joining of it unto Mantua, it was erected into a
Dukedom by Maximilian the 2d, Anno 1575, William the 3d being then Duke of
Mantua.

The chief order of Knighthood in this Dukedom, is of The blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, instituted Anno 1608. The Author of this order was Duke Vincent
Gonzaga, Seld^n.
when the marriage was solemnized between his son Francis, now Duke, and the
Lady Margaret, daughter to the Duke of Savoy. It consists of twenty Knights,
whereof the Mantuan Dukes are Sovereigns; and was allowed by Pope Paul the
5th. The Collar has threades of gold laid on fire, and inter-wouen with these
words, Domine probasti. To the Collar are pendant two Angels, supporting three
drops of blood, and circumscribed with, Nihil isto triste recepto. It took
this name, because in Saint Andrews Church in Mantua, are kept as a most
precious relic, certain drops of our Saviors blood; (thou can not O
Reader but believe it) with a piece of the sponge.

The Territories of this Duke, are in circuit nigh unto those of Florence, but
his revenues f^ll short, which amount to about 500000 Ducats only: but might
be greater, if either the D. would be burdensome to his subjects, as Florence
is; or if he were not on all sides landlocked from navigations and traffic.

THE DVKEDOME OF VRBIN.
THE DVKEDOME OF VRBIN, lies in the midst of the Papal Territories, having on
the North the Adri^tiq^e, on the South the Appennine, on the West Romagna, on
the East Marca Anconitana. The length of it is 60, the breadth 35 miles: the
revenues are 100000 Crowns, Grimston.
whereof, 2240 are due to the Popes for chief rents.

Here are 200 Castles, Hist. of I^.
and 7 Towns. The chief of the seven Towns are 1 Vrbine, seated on the bottom
of the Appennine, and bu^lt in the fashion of a Miter; it was called Vrbinas,
quia Vrbes binas continere videbatur. In this City Polydor Virgil was borne,
who writ an English History, though not altogether so true as I could wish,
especially in those passages, which concern the regality and credit of the
Popes of Rome, the Collectour of whose Peter Pence in England, P. Virg.
he then was. These Peter pence (if it be not out of my road to note it in
this place) were first granted to the Roman Popes by Offa king of the Mercians,
about the year 730; confirmed by Ethelwolphe the second Saxon Monarch; and
finally wisely withheld from the^ by Henry 8t^, at such time as he began to
know his own strength and supremacy. The 2d town is Belfort^, seated in the
midland. 3 Pisauro a good haven. 4 Cabo. 5 Fano, sea-townes also. The
principal of the 200 Castles are the Rock of Saint Leo, Guicciard,
and Marivol, which were the last that held good for Duke Guido Baldo, against
Caesar Borgia, Duke of Valentinoys; and the first that came again under his
obedience. For which cause when he fled the second time from the said C^sar; he
dismantled all his other castles, as being more likely to confirm the invaders
victory, then resist it: these two being well fortified, he left to keep as much
as in them lay, possession of his Country.

In the wars between Lewis of Bavaria the Emperor, Hist. of I^.
and Pope Clement the first; Gelasso di Montefeltro was the Emperors
Vicegerent in Vrbine, 1345. His posterity continued in that office, till the
year 1444; when Lord Frederick for his surpassing valor, was by Eugenius the
fourth, made Duke of Vrbine; cond^tionally, in token of allegiance he should
pay to the Popes yearly, 2240 Crowns. This Frederick was by ou^ Henry the
sixth, made Knight of the Garter; to requite which honor, the English to this
day enjoy many immunities in his Dominions. Guido Vbaldo this Dukes son, lost
this Duchy to Caesar Borgia. He, after the death of his father, left it to the
Pope Iuli^ the second: who gave it, Anno 1504, to Francisco Maria, Nephew and
adopted son unto the late Duke Guido Vbaldo. The present Duke is also named
Francisco Maria. Here are only 3 Bishops.

THE PRINCIPATE OF PARMA AND PLACENTIA.
This PRINCIPATE has on the North Mantuae, on the South the Appeni^e, Maginus.
on the West Millaine, on the East the country of Modenae. The revenues are
50000 crowns, the commodities common to the rest of Italy; here are also the
excellent Cheeses, called Parmesans. The City of Parma is seated on a little
river called ^irnia; Placentia is seated on the Po. They have both partaken of
diversity of fortune, Hist. of It.
being sometime under the Venetians, sometime under the Millanois, and finally
under the Roman ^relates. Paul the third gave them to his son Peitre Alvigi
Farn^sis, 1546; adding in recompense to the Church, the Signiory of Caemerine,
which he had taken from Guido Maria; D. of Vrbin. Sleidan com.
This Peitro Aluigi, or Lewis Farnesis, was a man of a most villainous
behavior; and amongst other crimes committed an unspeakable violence, on the
person of Cosmus Charius, Bishop of Fanum, and then poisoned him; for which
detestable action, he received no other chastisement of his Father Christ's
Vicar, then Haec vitia me non co^monstra^ore didicit. At last behauing himself
so insolently, he was slain by Count John Aguzzolo; and Placentia was yielded
to Fernand Gonzaga, the Spanish Viceroy in Millaine; Parma being fortified by
the Pope, Hist. of Fr.
was given to his Nephew Octavian Farnesis. Yet could not this donation so
assure the Estate, but that Octavian had quite lost it; if Henry 2d of F^ance
had not taken him into his protection. For the Emperor Charles fully
determined, (notwithstanding that Octavian had married his base daughter) to
have made hims^l^ Lord of the town: and the French King was loath to see so
great a strength added to the Emperors possession in Italy. When the war had
now last^d four years, Philip the second, which succeeded Charles,
considering how necessary it was for his affairs in Italy, to have this
Octavian his friend: restored unto him again this Plaisance, or Placentia, and
so withdrew him from the French faction, Anno 1557. Yet because he would be
sure to keep this house in a perpetual dependence on Spain, he restored it
not absolutely, but only for four generations. He made also Alexander Farnesis
Commander of the Netherlands, therein giving that family some small
satisfaction, for stepping between them in the Kingdom of Portugal. To this
Principate belongs Mirandula, with her Territories, where that learned
Scholar Picus Mirandula was borne.

The Principate has

THE STATE OF GENOA.
THE STATE OF GENOA was once very great, containing Liguria, or Riuiera di
Genoa; Capha with the adjacent Country in Taurica Chersonesus; Pera in Thrace,
part of Tuscany; Sardinia, Corsica, Lesbos, and many other Islands, dispersed in
the Greek Seas. They have now nothing left but Liguria, and Corsica; Sardinia
was taken from them by the Arragonians; Capha, and the Islands by the Turks;
their land in Tuscany by the great Duke; Hist. of Ven.
and their strength at Sea broken by the Venetians. These last they had once in
so great an exigent, that the Senate of Venice once sent unto Peter Doria,
Captain of the Gen^an Navy, a blanke Charter, to prescribe them what
conditions he would, and they would gladly accept them. Doria. proud of his
advantage, would have the City of Venice to use as he best pleased: whereupon
the Venetians grown desperate, assaulted the secure Genoys, and took 100 of
their Boats and Galleys; after which loss, the men of Genoa still had the
worse, and were at last compelled to submit themselves to the protection of the
Kings of Naples, then to the French, then to the Dukes of Millaine, and now to
the Spanish, as being Lords of Millaine, and most able to help them. While they
were under the tuition of Millaine, their good Master Lodowicke Sforza, exacted
a great mass of money of them. His Negotiator (as the tale goes) was invited
by a Genoys to dinner, and walking in the Garden, he showed the Ambassador the
herb Basel. He gently stroking it, smelt thence a sweet savor; but straining
it hardly, as unsavory a smell; whereon the Genoys in^erred, Sir, if our Lord
Duke Lodowicke will gently stroke the hand of his puissance over this City, it
will be pleasing to him by obedience: but i^ he seek to oppress it, it may
chance to prove unsavory by rebellion.

Having acquainted you thus far with the ancient State of this Commonwealth:
I will next describe unto you Liguria, which is all now left on the maine land.

Liguria has on the East the river Varus, rising abo^t the edge of Provence;
on the West the river Magra, by which it is parted from Tuscany; on the North
the Appenine; on the South the Ligurian or Tyrrhenian Seas: it is in length 80
miles, not so much in breadth.

Florus.
The ancient Inhabitants were the Deceates, Oxilij, En^uriades, and the Ingauni.
They were vanquished by the Romans, after the end of the first Punick wars;
yet not with much labor and pains; by reason of the woods, marshes, and
mountains, within and behind which, they retired and saved themselves. And
indeed it was a matter of more difficulty to find, then conquer them, Aliquanto
mayor erat labor (says Florus) invenire, quam vincere. They had diverse times
molested the Romans, till at last Postumius so disweaponed them, that he scarce
le^t them instruments to plough the Earth. What the men were, may be known by
their exploits above named; but now they are rather addicted to merchandice,
then war; but most of all to usury, a vice which the Christians learned of
the Jews, and are now thought to equal, if not exceed their teachers. It was
the saying of a merry fellow, that in Christendom there we neither scholars
enough, Gentlemen enough, nor Jews enough: and when answer was made, that of
all these there was rather too great a plenty, then any scarcity; he repl^ed,
that if th^re were scholars enough, so many would not be double or ^eth^e
beneficed; if Gentlemen enough, so many Peasant; would not be ranked among the
Gentry; and if Jews enough, so many Christians would not profess usury.
Hist. of Ita.
The women are very fair and comely, wearing for the most part their hair in
tresses, which they c^st over their backs; they wear no upper garments but of
cloth, as being only allowed by the Laws, but their vndergarments of the
purest stuff. The women here are privileged above all Italy, having free
leave to talk with whom they will, and be courted by any that will, both
privately and publicly.

The chief Towns are 1 Ceva, 2 Finali 3 Noli. 4 Sarazena, a strong fortress
against the great Duke. 5 Savona, taken Anno 1250. Guicciard.
Famous is this Town for that notable interview here made, between Ferdinand
of Spain, and Lewis the 12th of France, Anno 1507; who having bin deadly
enemies by reason of the Realm of Naples, taken from Lewis by Ferdinand, at
this town, most strangely relied on one another faith. Lewis first bording
Fernando's Galley, and Fernando for diverse days together feasting with Lewis
in this Town, which to him then belonged. These interviewes seldom have happened
among Princes that have bin at enmity; and when they do, they prove often very
dangerous. Nay, that notable Statesman Comines, utterly disliketh all interview
between Princes confederate, and entirely loving each other, as many times
producing effects contrary to their intents: which he proves by the example of
Lewis the 11th, and Henry of Castile, who meeting purposely, Ao 1463. took such
a dislike at each others person, and behavior, that they never after loved one
another. The like examples he brings of interviewes, between Frederick the
Emperor, and Charles Duke of Burgundy, and our Edward the fourth with the
same Charles; together with diverse others very pregnant. His reasons I omit,

and make haste to 7 Genoa, a town built by Ianus, who first dwelt in Italy;
afterward burnt by Mago the Carthaginian, and reedified by Charles the Great;
under whose successors it continued till the Berengarij made it free, Anno
899. Not long after in the Holy land wars, they sent seven several Armies*
and grew so powerful, that in 3 days they sent to Sea 58 Galleys, and 8
Pamphili (being Boats of 140, or 160 Oars on a side) and on another occasion
suddenly armed 165 Galleys at once. By this strength they got the better hand
diverse times of the Ve^etians, they won diverse Islands; and beat the Pisani
out of Sardinia, Corsica, and the Baleares, compelling them to pay 135000
Crowns for their peace. During this prosperity, they were ruled by a common
Council, without any superior power: but the people in the year 1339, in a
seditious tumult, chose one Simon Bocanegra for their Duke; the name of which
office is still remaining, but not the authority; the Carcass, but not the
Body: The Duke being at this time new chosen every year, and having his
authority limited by 8 Governors, and 8 Protectours. Now fortune moves
retrograde, and the people fell to private factions, first between the Dorij and
Spinoli, against the Frischi and Grima^di, 1174. Secondly, the Negri and
Mollani, against the Salvatici and Embriaci, 1289. Thirdly the Spinoli and
Dorij* 1306. Fourthly, the Nobility and Commons 1339. Those factions and often
overthrow; given by the Venetians, together with the surprisall of their
towns and Islands by the Turk, so distracted them, that they were glad to
submit to the Prince aboue-named. The King of Spain is now their Protector,
and that not for naught, he being indebted to them a Million and a half of
gold; which is the remainder of many Millions, cut off by the Popes authority,
that so the Kings might be indebted to that See: for most of his Lands were
formerly engaged to the Mony-masters of this City. The same course of
non-payment, the King took with the rest of his creditors in Florence, A^sburg,
and the rest: Insomuch, that it was commonly said in Italy, that the King of
Spain had made more ill faces upon the Exchange in one day, then Michael
Angelo the famous Painter had ever made good in his life.

Hist. of Ita.
The Town is in compass 8 miles, the buildings for the height of two stories,
are made of Marble, and curiously wrought, but the laws forbid Marble to be
used any higher. There is a very fair and capacious haven, and weary well
fortified, where Ships may be secure from tempest and other violence: So that
the Spaniards say, that were the Catholic K. absolute Lord of Marseiles in
Provenoe, and Genoa in Italy, he might command the whole world. Thus you see
this great City which commanded the Ocean, the Lady of so many Islands, and a
great Moderator of the affairs of Italy, saine to put her self into the
protection of a foreign Prince; yet is she not so low, but that her publiquo
revenue may amount to 430000 Crowns yearly.

The State has Maginus.

THE STATE OF LVCA.
THE STATE OF LVCA is situate in Tuscanie, Boterus.
it comprehends the Territories and Town of Luca, built by Lucumo king of
Italy, on the river Serch^us; the Town is in compass 3 miles, the Territories
80 miles; out of which the State can raise 3000 horse, Florus.
and 15000 foot. In this town was the meeting of three great Captains, Pompey,
Caesar, and Crassus; so pernicious to the Roman Republicke. For Pompey desirous
to retain potencie, Crassus to increase his possessions, and Caesar to get
honors, here joined their forces together. Pompeys powerablenesse, was vpheld
by Caesar's armies, and Cressus wealth: Caesar's armies were assigned him by
reason of Pompeyes authority, and Crassus money; Crassus estate was protected
by Pompeyes greatness, and secured by ^aesars military reputation. This done,
they made a division of the Roman Provinces betwixt them: To Caesar was
allotted all Gallia; to Pompey, Spain; to Crassus, Syria. This confederacy
was the cause of the overthrow of the Republicke; for Crassus being once
sl^ine, Caesar and Pompey wanting a third man to keep the scale even, fell
presently at odds, and thence to civil wars, whose end made Caesar Lord of
Rome. On this meeting, and the succeeding breach was grounded that so
celebrated speech of Cicero, Vtinam Pompeius cum Caesare s^cietatem aut nunquam
co^sset, aut nunquam dirim^sset.

The men of Luca were under the Empire, ti^l Rodo^phas sold them their liberty
for 10000 Crowns, which was disbursed for them by a Cardinal. Their chief
officer or Gonfaloniere, is changeable every second month; he is assisted by a
choice number of Citizens, alterable every sixth month; during which time they
live all in one Palace together.

The people of this State have bin tossed from the Genoys, to the Venetian, and
from them to the Millainoys and Florentine. They now enjoy a perfect quiet
under the win^s of Spain, and of late are grown very rich, so that the
public revenues may be about 80000 Crowns; this long peace has so blessed
the people. Here are only two Bishops.

OF BELGIA.
ON the Northwest of Italy, lies Germany, which is divided into the higher,
and the lower; this latter is called BELGIA, and Gallia Belgica: Maginus.
It is bounded on the East with the Ems, and part of Germany; on the West with
the German Sea; on the North with East-Freizeland; and on the South with the
Some, Champaigne, and Lorraine.

The names pertaining to the whole Region, are Belgia, from Belgus, once a King
of this Country; and also the Low Countries, and the Netherlands, from their
low situation. The more peculiar is Flanders, which though but one of the
Provinces, has yet for its fame, given denomination unto Belgia; all whose
inhabitants were once called Flemmings.

Old Belgia, or Gallia Belgicae, was of more large extent by far, than it now
is, as containing the Dukedomes of Lorrei^e, Cleue, and Iuliers; the
Bishoprics of Collen, Mentz, and Triers, with all that part of France beyond
the river Seine. The Belg^ were or^ginally Germans, who driving out the Gauls,
here planted themselves. They were by Caesar accounted to be the valiantest of
the French Nation, and that for three causes. First, they were the farthest
from Provence, where the Roman ciuility, and more affable course of life was
embraced. 2ly, They dwelt on a Sea, not then frequented by Merchants; and so
wanted those allurements to effeminacie, which are in Countries of traffic.
And 3ly they bord^red on the Germans, a wa^like nation, with whom they were
continually in arms. This people seeing the prosperous success of Caesar's
victories in Gaul, joined together in a common league; and minist^ed an army
of 269000 fighting men against him. But seeing they could not draw him out of
his sortresse, they retired again; but in such disorder, that three Legions
(for no more was Caesar's army) put them to an infinite slaughter. After this,
Caesar fighting against them severally, overcame them all.

Belgia, or the Netherlands, is in compass 1000 miles, situate in the North
temperat zone, under the 8^h and 11th Climats, the longest day being 17 hours.
Guicciard.
The Air in these latter days, is grown much more wholesome then formerly it
has been, partly by the wonderful increase of the Inhabitants; and partly by
the industry of the people; who by drawing the marshes, and converting the
standing waters, or channels, into running streams, have purged the Air of
many gross vapors, thence usually arising.

The Country is very populous, containing well nigh 3 millions of souls; the
men being for the most part well proportioned, much given to our English Bee^e,
unmindful both of good turns, and injuries: they did invent Clocks, Printing,
and the Compass. They restored Music, and found out diverse musical
instruments. To them also belong the invention of Chariots; the laying of
colors with oil; the working of pictures in glass: and the making of
Worsted, Says, Tapestrie, etc. The women generally are of a good complexion,
well proportioned, especially in the leg and foot; honourers of virtue, active,
and familiar, Both within doors, and without, they govern all; which
considering the natural desire of women to bear rule, makes them too
imperious and burdensome.

They use the German or Dutch tongue, with a little difference in Dialect; and
in some places adjoining to France, they have a little smattering of that
language.

The Country lies exceeding low upon the Seas, insomuch, that it is much
subject to inundations. In the time of Henry the 2d, Flanders was so
overflowed, that many thousands of people, whose dwellings the Sea had
devoured, came into England to beg new seats; and were by that King first
placed in Yorkshire, and then removed to Pembrookeshire. Guicciard.
Since that, it has in Zealand swallowed eight of the Islands, and in them 300
towns and villages; many of whose Churches and strong buildings, are at a dead
low water to be seen; and as Ovid has it, of Helice and Buris, cities of
Achaia*

Invenies sub aquis; and adhuc ostendere nautae
Inclinata s^lent cum moenibus oppida versir.
The water hides them, and the shipmen show
The ruined walls, and steeples as they row.
The Commodities with which they most abound, are Li^nens, Scarlet, Worsted,
Says, Silks, Veluets, and the like s^^ffes; Armor, Cables, Ropes, Butter,
Cheese.

Famous Captains here have not bin many, the people till these our days,
living in perpetual peace; the chief of such as have been, were William
Earl of Holland, chosen also Emperor of Germany; Baldwin Earl of Flanders,
Emperor of Greece, and in these latter days the Princes of the house of
Nassaw.

Scholars it has bred many, as Iustus Lipsius, Erasmus, that great restorer
of Learning in these parts; G^mma Frisias, R^dolphus Agricola, I^nus Douza,
Putean, Levi^us Lemnius, Ortelius, Mercator, etc.

Cam^en.
The Christian Religion was planted in several Provinces, by several men; in
Holland, Zealand, and Freizland, by Willbr^d an Englishman, the first Bishop of
Vtrecht. They are at this present, divided in opinion; the States allow free
exercise only of the Reformed; the Archduke only of the Romish Religion; which
has been the cause of all the wars in these Countries.

Sr W. Ral.
The Revenew, before the Spaniard made war upon them, was three Millions of
Crowns: and indeed this town was the correlatiue of the Indies; the loss of
which, has cost the King of Spain above 100 Millions of Gold, and 400000 men.

Hist. of Netherl.
The chief Rivers are 1 Rhene, into which the old Belgi did use to cast the
children, which they suspected to be illegitimate: for were they borne of a
lawful bed, they floated on the waters; if of an unlawful, they sanke
immediately. Whereunto Claudian alluding, says, Nascentes explorat gurgite
Rhenus. But that great searcher of Antiquities, V^rstegan, is of opinion, that
they hereby inured only their Children to hardness, and made ^^yall of their
strength, adultery being rarely found among them: and so these kinds of
experiments needless. 2 Mosa, which does compass half the Country. 3 Ems,
dividing the two Freizlands. 4 Scaldis, which arising in Picardie, and running
through Artoys, and between Haynault, and Brabant, meets with the se^ a
little above Antwerpe: and 5 Lie, or Ley, which runs quite through Flanders.

The shore of this Country has bin much out-worne by the Sea, L. Guicciar.
especially that of the Islands of Zeal^nd, and such as lie scattred about
Holland, where they are defended with banks and ramparts painfully made, and
chargeably maintained. These banks are about ten else in height, and 25 in
breadth at the bottom: they are made of the hardest clay that may be gotten; in
the inside stuffed with wood and stone; on the outside covered with matts,
strong and thick made.

The former inhabitants were diverse, as shall be showed in their diverse
Provinces, they are at this present divided into 17 Provinces.

1. LIMBOVRG.
The Duchy of LIMBOVRG, and the Bishopric of LIEGE, or LVYCKE, are
environed with Brabant, and Namurce, West: with Brabant and Gulicke, North:
with Gulicke and Collen, East: and with Luxenbourg, South. The Western part
belongs to the Bishop, which comprehends 24 walled towns, and 1800
Villages, with Parish Churches. The Bishop is a Prince of the Empire, D. of
Bouillon, Marquess of Franchimont, Earl of Hasbani; and has under him 52
Baronies of note. He is chosen by the Chapter of S. Lambert, which is the
chief Church in Liege, or Luyck, the chief town seated on the Meuse. The
buildings of this town are very fair, especially the Monasteries and Abbeyes;
for which cause it is called the Paradise of Priests. This town next to Gaunt,
has bin accounted the most seditious Town of Europe, and was twice taken, and
once destroyed by Charles of Burgundy, 1468. It is an University, in which
were students at one time, nine kings sons; 24 Dukes sons, ^9 Earls
sons, besides Barons and Gentlmen. 2 Tongres a town now of no great bigness;
yet once so large, that Atti^a king of the Hunnes, destroyed in it 100
Churches. 3 Dinand, hard upon Namur, destroyde by Charles of Burgundy. 4 Huy.
5 Bi^sen. 6 Truden. This Bishopric was erected by Pope Constantine, Anno 710.

The Eastern part is properly called the Duchy of Limbourg: It contains 5
Towns, viz: Limbourg on the river Weser. 2 Walkembourg, conquered by John D.
of Brabant. 3 Dalem strengthened with a castle. 4 Rode le Buck; 5 Carpen,
seated between Gulick and Collen, and 123 Villages. It is said of this Country,
that the bread is better then bread, the fire hotter then fire, and the Iron
harder then Iron.

The Ancients were the Eburones.

This Province of an Earldom, was made a Dukedom by the Emperor Fred.
Barbarossa; 1172: and being destitute of heirs males, was seized on by the
Brabantine, 1293.

The Arms are Argent, a Lion Barrie, of 10 pieces, O, and G.

Earn.
2. LVXENBOVRG.
LVXENBOVRG is bounded with Lembourg on the North; Lorraine on the South; the
Bishopric of Triers on the East; and the Meuse on the West. It is in circuit
240 miles, in which are contained 1169 Villages, L. Guicci^r.
and 23 walled Towns: the chief being Luxenbourg on the river Alsnuius, or
Elze: It took name, either quasi Leucorum burgum, from the Leuci being the
first inhabitants: or quasi Lucis burgum, because the Sun was here adored. It
is nor yet recovered of the lasting wars between the French and Spaniards,
brought unto her. 2 Bostonack^ a fair town, and commonly called the Paris of
Ardenne For this Prou^nce is divided into two parts, viz; Ardenne being on the
West, and Fannene on the East quarters. 3 Thio^ vitae, taken and spoiled by the
French, 1558, 4 Mommedi, and 5 Danvillers, ransacked by the French, 1552. 6
Neufe ch^^^l. 8 Rock de March: and 9 Arluna, whose name quasi Ara lu^ae,
imports the Moon to have bin here worshipped. The Ancients were the Leuci
and Lingones; the language toward Lo^reine, French: in other parts Dutch.

Here is the Forest Ardenna, once 500 miles compass, now scarce 90 miles
round, of which so many fabulous stories are reported. In this Forest, or
about the edges thereof, are the famous hot Baths, frequented from all the
places of Europe, and called the Spa, not so pleasant as wholesome, not so
wholesome as famous: Yet are they good for sundry d^seases, as the Tertian
Ague, and Dropsy, the Stone, the exulceration of the lungs, the Sci^tique,
etc. They are of most virtue in July, because they are then hottest; and to
such as taste them, they relish much of iron; from some iron mines, it
seems, through which the waters run.

In the skirts of this Country, toward France, stands the Duchy of
Bovillon; the Prince whereof is of the French Nobility and a great assistant to
the Protestants: his chief Towns are Sedan and Bouillon. Of these, Bouillon is
in the hands of the Bishop of Liege; to who^ Godfrey of Bouillon, at his
journey into the Holy land, sold it. It has since that time, bin sometimes in
the possessions of the Bishops, sometimes of the Dukes. Sedan the Dukes seat, is
a fine town, and honored with a seat of Learning, which is a Schola illustris;
to which diverse resort to study, but cannot take any degrees: so that I think
this and the like places of study, are not much unlike the two famous collegiat
Schools of Winchester, and Eaton with us; the greatest difference being, that
in these last named, learning is more restrained to particularities, then in
the other. Tilenus, before his fall from the true Church, was Professor of
Divinity here: and here Berchat the Scholiast on Stephanus Catechism, taught
Greek.

Luxenbourg was formerly an Earldom, two of whose Earls were famous, Munster.
viz: Henry the 7th, who was poisoned by a Friar, in the Chalice; and John, who
was by the States chosen King of Bohemia. His successors jointly ruled in both
Provinces, the space of 130 years: during which time, Luxenbourg was made a
Duchy, by the Emperor Wenceslaus. This man's brother Sigismund, sold it to
Antony Duke of Brabant, in respect of a marriage between the said Antony, and
Elizabeth daughter to John D. of Gorlits, younger brother to this Sigismund.
After the death of Duke Antony and his wife, this Dukedom sell to Philip the
Good; the Dukes elder brother, and heir.

3. GELDERLAND.
GELDERLAND (so called from Geldabum, once the metropolis) has on the East
Cleue, on the West Brabant, on the North Freizland, on the South Limbourg. It
contains 300 Villages, L. Guicciar.
and 24 Towns, the chief being Noviomagum, or Nanmegon, once a free City;
and subdued by the Geldroys, 1248 It is seated on that branch of the Rhene,
which is called the Whaell; and was by Charles the great made one of the seats
of the Empire in these parts; the other two being Aken, and Thinovill. The
homage which it owes to the Empire, whereof it was a free town; is only a
glove of peper, which once in the year they must send to Aken. 2 Ruermond, so
called of the river Ruer, and Monde, which signifies a mouth. 3 Arhnem, which
was wont to be the residence of the Gu^lderland Dukes. 4. Harderwicke, which
together with the two former, was walled by Otho the third Earl. 5 Doesbourg.
6 Buren an Earldom; one of the Earls whereof was the Count Egmond, who being
opposite to the Prince of Oranges counsel, about resisting the Duke of Alva's
entrance; was the first which by the said Duke was betrayed, and beheaded.
Philip of Nassaw, the elder brother of Prince Maurice, was during his life
Earl of Bur^n, in right of his mother; who was heir unto Maximilian de Egmond
Earl hereof.

This Country is sit for feeding Beasts: which grow so great and fat; that Anno
1570, there was a Gelderland Bull killed at Antwerpe, which weighed 3200 pounds.

The Ancients were the Menapij and the Sicambri.

The Country was governed by Lords, till the year 1079; Munster.
in which, Lord Otho was made Earl: and Anno 1339, Earl Remald, was by the
Emperor Lodovicus Bavarus made Duke. It was sold by Duke Arnald, to Charles
Duke of Burgundy for 92000 Florens, and an annual pension, 1472.
Notwithstanding this compact, Adolph that wicked Prince, his son succeeded,
and him his son Charles: after whose death, Charles the 5th possessed
himself of Gueldres, and Zutphen, Anno 1543.

The Arms are B, a Lion O, crowned G.

4. BRABANT.
BRABANT (quasi Brachland, id est, a barren soil) has on the East, Guicciard.
North, and South, the Meuse; on the West the Schald. It is in length 75, in
breadth 60 miles; comprehending 700 Villages, and 26 Towns: the chief being
Lovaine, where is an University, erected by Duke John the 4th, Anno 1426: here
is also a Seminary of English Jesuits. It is in compass within the walls,
four miles; and 6 without: within which compass are many goodly Gardens,
Valleys, Mountains, Meddowes, etc. This is the mother town of Brabant, and
the first which receaveth and gives oath to their new Lord. In this
University are about 20 Colleges. 2 Bruxels, the Dukes seat, a town of the
same bigness with Lovaine; but for all commodities of pleasure, and profit; as
also for the vniformenes and elegancy of the building, far beyond it. 3
Bergen ap Some, famous for the notable resistance it made to Spinola 1622. 4
Boldue. 5 Tilmont. 6 Mastricht, a Bishops See, till the remoouall to Liege;
here are two Churches of Canons, in one of which the Duke of Brabant is always
a Canon. It is subject partly to the Duke of Brabant, and partly to the Bishop
of Liege, in whose country it stands. The children are subject to that Prince
always, to whom their mother was subject, without relation to the fathers
subjection* and when a stranger comes to dwell there, he may live under which
of them he list. 7 Breda, the seat of the Princes of Orange till the last wars.
It was taken from the Spaniard by a few venterous Gentlemen, who hiding
themselves in a boat covered with Turfe, were conveyed into the Castle, which
they ma^^^^d: and the next day made the Prince of Orange Lord of it again. The
people here of are none of the wisest, especially when they incline toward
age; hence that saying of Erasmus, Brabanti qu^ magis senescunt, eo magis
stultescunt.

5. THE MARQVISATE.
Ortelius.
THE MARQVISATE of the holy Empire, is contained in Brabant. The chief Town is
Antwerpe, being of an orbicular form, and in circuit 7 miles. It was before
the civil wars a Town of infinite trading; the things bought and sold here,
amounting to more in one month; then that of Venice in 2 years. But now the
Hollanders have so blocked up the Haven, that the traffic is removed hence to
Amsterdam. In th^s Antwerp there are 8 principal Channels cut out of the
Schelde, on which the Town is seated; Guicciard.
the biggest of them being able to receive 100 great ships. The causes of the
great increase of this town were three: 1 Two Marts holden here every year,
either of them during 6 weeks; in which space no man can either in his person,
or his goods, be arrested. 2ly, The King of Portugal having in the year 1503,
diuerted the course of traffic from Alexandria and Venice, to Lisbon: kept
here his Factor, and sent hither his spice; for which cause, Anno 1516, many
Merchants left Bruges, and dwelt here. 3ly, In the wars between the French,
and Charles the fifth, many Gentlemen and others forsook the Villages, and
built here; so that Antwerpe is since that time bigger then it was, by above
3000 houses.

These two Provinces were united to Lorreine till the dates of Otho the 3d:
Munster.
who gave the Dukedom of Brabant to one Conrade, 985, The Marquisate was by
the same Otho erected, for the dowre of his aunt Gerberge, mother to Lotharius
King of France. How they became united, I have not yet learned. In the year
1385, died John D. of Brabant, leaving his estate to his eldest daughter Jane;
who dying without issue, gave this Duchy to Antony, who was second son of
Philip Duke of Burgundy and to Margaret; danghter unto Margaret her younger
sister. After this Antony, succeeded his two sons John and Philip; who
quickly dying left their estate to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.

The Arms of Brabant are Sable a Lion Or. Bara.


6. FLANDERS.
FLANDERS, so called a Flando, because it lies open to the w^ndes, is divided

by the river Ley, or Lis. The chief towns are Gaunt or Gandavum, whose wall
is 7 miles in compass; within which is much wast ground. The ^i^ers Schald and
Ley run through it, and make in it 26 Islands, joined together with 98
Bridges: and had not her often seditious, ruinated her beauties, she might have
been Queen of Europe. In this Town was borne John Duke of Lancaster, usually
called John of Gaunt. 2 Burgis, or Brugg, once a famous Mart Town; but now not
a little decayed, by reason that the seat of traffic was removed hence to
Antwerpe. It was walled by Earl, Baldwin, Ao 890: it is distant 3 leagues from
the Sea; and is seated on a fair and deep Channel, made by art; and filled
with the waters of all the adjoining fountains and riuerets. These artificial
Channels are in these Countries very frequent, to the great enriching of the
whole state. 3 Ypres, a town seated very str^n^ly, and almost impregnable, It
stands on a small river so named. 4 Winnocks Berge,, so called of Winno^ an
Englishman, of holy and pure life. 5 Graueling on the sea side, which since the
taking of Callais by the French, has been made the strongest sort of the Low
Countries. 6 Oudenard, the birthplace of Margaret Duchess of Parma, the
gouernesse here for King Ph^l^^* and mother to that excellent Soldier,
Alexander Farnesis. The some principal ports of Flanders* are 1 Dunkerke, the
people of which in the late wars, so in^ested the Seas. 2 Scluse (...) the
mo^th of the Channel of Bruges. It has a very fai^^h ^en able to contain 500
good ships; and is now subject to the States: with whose welfare it cannot
stand, to suffer the King of ^paine, to enjoy any safe and large harbor in
those Seas. ^ Newport, near unto which was fought a field battle between
Archduke Albertus, Hist. of the N^therl.

of the Veres, and valor of the English. 4 Ostend, which held against the
Archduke a siege of three years, and as many months.

Imperial Flanders, so called, becuase it was long under the obedience of the
Emperors; Guicciard.
is severed from Brabant, by the river Dender, from the Gallicke Flanders, by
the river Schelde, about Oudenarde. The chief Towns are, 1 Alost, on the
Dender. 2 Dendermond, at the mouth of the said river. 3 Hulst. 4 Axele. and 5
Rupelmond, the birthplace of Mercator, that excellent Cosmographer.

Gall^cke Flanders, so called, because it is properly belonging to France,
whose language is still here used; is severed from the Teutonicke Flanders, by
the river Leye; and from the Imperial, by the Schelde, about Oudenard. The
chief Towns are Lisle, or Ryssell, the third town of traffic in all the
Netherlands. 2 Doway an University. 3 Orchies. 4 Armentiers. 5 St Amand. and 6
Turnay, or Dornicke, on the Schaldis; taken by our Henry the 8, 1513: to whom
the Citizens paid 100000 Ducats for their ransom. It was restored to the
French for 600000 Crowns; and from him again taken by Charles the fifth.

There are in all Flanders 35 Towns, and 1178 Villages. The country is in
length 96 miles, in breadth much less; it is bounded with Brabant on the East;
Picardy on the West; the Sea on the North; Artoys on the South.

Munster.
The ancient inhabitants were the Morini and Rutheni. The first Earl was
Baldwin, promoted to that dignity by Charles the Bald, Anno 863. It is
accounted the prime Earldom, as Millaine is the prime Dukedom of Europe. The
Earl among other prerogatives, writes himself Comes Dei gratia; others only
Dei Clementia. The same of this Country has been so great, that it has
been used for all Belgia; It was united to the house of Burgundy, by the
marriage of Duke Philip the hardy, to Margaret daughter to Lewis de Malaine,
Paradine.
Earl of Flanders Anno 1383. The Arms are Or, a Lion Sable, langued and armed
Gules.

7. ARTOYS.
ARTOYS has on the East, Hainalt; on the West, Picardy; on the North,
Guicciard.
Flanders; on the South, Champaigne. The ancients were the Attrebati It
contains 754 Villages, and 12 towns; the chief^ being Attreb^tium, or Arras,
whence come our clothes of Arras. 2 Air. 3 Pernes. 4 St Omer, a good haven. 5
Lilliers. and 6 Le cluse. The chief of the frontire towns, between this and
Picardie, are 1 Hedinfert, a very defensible town, built by Charles the
Emperor out of the ruins of old Hed^^, Comines.
which town he had razed, Anno 1553, when he took it from the French. 2
Rentie. On the West part of Artoys is St Paul, whereof Lewis of Luxenbourg was
Earl in the days of Lewis the 11th: with whom, as also with Charles of
Burgundy, and Edward of England, he played such cross tricks; that having
severally deluded them all, and kept them as well in continual stri^e with
each other, as an unseasonable suspicion of his untowardly plots; he was at
last by D. Charles taken, and beheaded.

The first Earl of Artoys, Paradine.
was Robert son to Lewis the 8h of France, Anno 1234. It was united to the
house of Burgundy, by marriage of Duke Philip, and Bonne daughter to Philip of
Artoys, 1424.

The Arms are Azure, Semi di flower de ly^^s Or, a file with three Labells
Gules, charged with as many Castles of the second.

8. HAINALT.
HAINALT, so called from the river Hania, Maginus.
has on the East, Limbourg; on the West, Flanders; on the North Braban^; on
the South Champaigne: It was formerly called Saltus Carbonatius, and the lower
Picardie. Grimston.
The length of it is 60 miles, and 48 the breadth; in which space are 950
Villages, and 24 towns: The chief being 1 Mons, strong, ancient, and rich. 2
Valenciennes so seated on the Scheld, that it cannot be besieged, but with
three Armies at once. 3 Cond^. 4 That old town Bavays, at a pillar whereof
begin all the ways leading into France, made of paued stone by Brunhault the
French Queen; who together with Fredegond, and Katherine de Medices, may be
called the three Furies of France. 5 Landrecy, on the river Sambre, famous for
the great resistance it made to Charles the fifth, Ano. 15^^. 6 Mariembourg,
built by Mary Queen of Hurgarie, Go^ernesse h^^e for her brother Charles,
1542. 7 Engien. ^ Re^^x. 9 Avennes on the borders toward Champaigne; about
which are d^gged excellent white stones for building, and little i (...) to
marble. On the South part of Hainault is the town and territory of Cambray.
This town was by the Emperors made free and Imperial: but by the French who
pretended title to it, diverse times possessed. In the time of Lewis the 11th,
it submitted it self voluntarily to Maximilian, afterward Emperor: whose
Nephew Charles, has fortified it with a strong cittadell: pretending their
safety, but indeed to keep it from revolt^ng. The people notwithstanding
retain their ancient ^^^edome, and privileges.

Hainalt was united to Flanders, Anno 1110; by marriage of Earl Baldwin, and
Margaret Countess of Flanders: and d^sioyned by John called Avenion, who took
it from his brothers Gu^do and William. This John married Atheilda, daughter
and heir to Floris, the 4th of Holland, Anno 1300: From which conjunction
issued John Earl of Holland and Hainalt.

Bara.
The Arms are quarterly Flanders, and Holland.

9. NAMVRCE
L. Guice.
NAMVRCE has on the East Limbourg; on the West, Hainalt; on the North Brabant;
on the South, Luxenbourg. This Country has great store of Coals, contrary to
the common nature of Coals, in that they are kindled with water, and quenched
with Oil. It contains about 180 Villages, and four Towns: viz: 1 Namurce,
seated where Sicambris pays his Tribute to Meuse. 2 Charlemont. 3 Valencourt.
4 Bovires. The men of this country are good Soldiers and very affectionate to
their Prince. The country very fruitful of all sorts of grain; enriched with
mines of I sper, and all sorts of marble: But in iron so ^bundant, that Vulcans
forge may seem to be restored again to the world, and seated in this
Province. All these commodities make the people as laborious, as wealthy. The
principal Villages are Floren, and Deue.

Munster.
This Fa^ledome was united to the house of Burgundy, Ano 1429, in which Earl
John sold it to Philip the Good.

The Arms are Or, Bara,

10. ZVTPHEN.
ZVTPHEN is a Town in Gelderland, which long has been an Earldom: Hist. of
Ne.
It is seated on the river Yssell, and is a town of very great strength; in
the siege of which was slain that honor of Chivalrie, and mirror of
learning, gallant St Philip Sidney, of whom our British Epigrammatist thus
versifieth.

11 HOLLAND.
HOLLAND, Ortelius.
quasi Hot-land, id est, a woody Country, has on the East* Vt echt^on the
West, and North, the Sea, on the South the Meuse. It is in cir^uit 180 miles,
no part of which is distant from the Sea, th^^e hours journey. It
comprehends 400 Vill^ges, and 23 Towns: the chief being 1 Dordrect or Do^t
where An^ 1618, was held a national Synod against the Arminians. ^ Har^em,
where printing was invented, and Tullies book^ de O^^i^ijs, was the first that

Here is in this town a Castle said to have b^ene buil^ed by Hengist the Saxon,

That he was the true Christ and Messiah. 3ly, That he had been till that
present, kept in a place unknown to all the Saints. And 4ly, that he was not
to restore the house of Israel by death or tribulation, but by the love and
grace of the spirit. He died in the year 1556; and three years after, his
doctrine was by them of Basil condemned; his goods confiscate, and his bones
taken up and burned. He bound his Disciples to three things, first to conceal
his name: 2ly, not to reveal of what condition he had been: and 3ly, not to
discover the articles of his doctrine to any man in Basil. 5 Alkmer, famous for
the defeat which the D. of Alva, received before it. For he in the beginning of
the Low country troubles, having with the loss of 20000 of his own men,
forced Ha^lem; laid his siege round about this town. Had he le^t any way for
his Soldiers to have fled thence, the town had bin abandoned; but having
environed them round, he put them to such a resolution, or desperation, choose
you whether; that manfully they resisted 3 of his assaults; and in the end made
him depart, with great loss, as well of his Soldiers, as his reputation. 7

The present inhabitants are generally given to S^afa^ing lines: So that it is
thought that in Holland, Zeland and Friezland, are 2500 good ships fit for
burden, and war. The women are all laborious in making stuffes; nay you can
scarce find a boy of 4 years of age, which cannot earne his own meat. The
greatest commodity is Butter and Cheese: of which, besides that which they use
themselves; they make 100000l yearly of that which they sell to their
neighbors. By these means they are grown so potent and rich, that as
Flanders hereto^ore; so now Holland is taken generally for all the Provinces, I
mean the United.

One miraculous accident I cannot ouerpass^ in silence namely how Margaret

bestowed that care in fortifying this town, which he did in strengthening
Antwerp; he had in all probability, hindered the general revolt of these
countries. Nigh to this Town is the fort Ramkins, once cautionary to the
English, together with the Brill, the chief town in the I Will of Voo^ne which
is situate over against the South of Holland; and commands all that passage
down to Gertrudenberg, in Brabant. These towns were taken from the Spaniard,
Ao 1572; assigned to Queen Elizabeth Ao 1585; and surrendered by King James to
the States, 1616. 3 Vere, or Canfer^, whence our English Veres took their

Schoven, whose Metropolis is Sirexee; the next being Breuers Haven. The fourth
is T^len, whose chief town is Tertolen. The other three are North Beverland,
Duveland, and Wolfersdike. In all this Country are eight Cities, 102
Villages. The soil is far more fruitful then any of Brabant; but they have
neither wood, nor fresh water.

The Arms are Or, a Lion Gules, ^ising out of a Sea wauie, Argent and Azure.

13 WEST-FREIZLAND.
Ortelius.
WEST-FREIZLAND, has on the East, Groyning; on the South, Overyssell; on the
other sides the Sea. It contains 345 Villages, and 11 Towns: the chief being
Lewarden, where the common council for the Province is kept. 2 Harlingem a Sea
Town. 3 Zwichen. 4 Doceum, where Gemma Frisius was borne* L. Gui^ciar.
and 5 Franeker, a new University. Near unto this Province is the I Will
Schelinke, the shoares whereof are plentifully stored with Dog-fish, who are
taken in this manner. The men of the Island attire themselves in beasts skins,
and then fall a dancing and leaping; with which sport the fish being delighted,
make out of the water toward them. When they have left the water, there are
nets pitched between it and them; which done, the men put off their disguizes,
and the frighted Fishes hasting toward the sea, are caught in the toils.

This Country had once its proprietary Kings, the last of which was Roboald,
vanquished by Charlemaigne, and the country was made a member of the French
Empire. Roboald during his captivity, was persuaded to be baptized, but being
ready to be sprinkled with the holy water, he demanded where were his friends,
and kinsfolks; answer was made that they were in h^^ because no Christians;
neither then will I, quoth he, for I love to be among my friends.

The first Earl of Holland, Hist. of Net
Zeland, and West-Freizland, was Thierrie of Aquitaine, preferred to that
dignity by Charles the bald, An^ 863. It was united to the house of Burgundy,
in the person of D. Philip the good, son unto Margaret, daughter to Albertu^
of Bavaria, Earl of Holland: which Philip succeeded Countess Iaqueline, who
died without issue, being daughter and heir to William, the brother of the
forenamed Margaret, Anno 1433.

The Arms of this Freizland are Azure, Bara.

14 VTRECHT. 15 OVERYSSELL.
VTRECHT and her Diocese was once part of Holland* Gul^ciard.
but now a distinct Province. It is bounded on the East with Gelderland; on the
North, South, and West, with Holland. It contains 70 Villages, and 5 Towns,
viz: 1 Rhenen. 2 Wick te Duerstede, on the South West side of the Province. 3
Amesfort just opposite to it, on the North. 4 Montscort on the Southwest; and 5
Vtrecht just in the midst. It was first called Antonins, of one of the
Antonines of Rome; afterward by Dagobert of France, Traiectum, because of the
common ferrie there. It is so seated, that a man may go from hence in one day,
to any one of 50 walled Towns equally from this distant: or to any of 26
Towns to dinner, and return again to bed. To her spiritual Jurisdiction
belongs the country beyond Yssell, now called OVERYSSELL or Transisulana. It
is bounded on the North with Freizland and Groyning; on the South with
Gelderland; on the East with Westphalia; on the West, with the Sea: containing
101 Villages, and 11 Towns; the chief of which are 1 Swall 2 Campene. 3

17 GROYNING.
GROYNING is a Town of Well-Fr^ezland, contain^ng under her command 145
Villages, the chief being (...), and Ke^kerke. Aurie^us.
The town is so called from a gree^e in (...) stands. It belonged formerly

able to defend his unjust detention, sold it to Cha^les (...) Gue^dres 1514:
and in the year following it (...) Charles the fifth, ^o whom George Duke of
Saxony (...) all his interest. This Town and her ter^^tory (which (...) the
Ommelands) was oue^-awed by the Duke of Par^^, 15^0, and was recovered by the
States in less then two mo^^^ 1594. The territories of this Province are
bounded on the East, Guicciard.
with East-Freizland; on the West, with West-Freizland; on the south with
Overyssell; on the North, with the Sea.

By the several means before recited, these several Provinces came under the
command of one Prince; who would have made is a kingdom, had not the diversity
of laws and prerogatives, hindered his intention. Hist. of the Netherl.
Howsoever they continued faithful subjects; and Charles the Emperor at his
death, commanded his son Philip to use that people well: telling him that
they had been the chief supporters of his estate and glory; and withal that
if he used them otherwise then gently, they would be the ruin and destruction
of him, and his fortunes; wherein the event showed that he was but too true a
Prophet. After the establishment of Philip in the government, they to gain his
favor, gave him 40 millions of Florens: but he unseasonably transported with
a superstitious zeal, forgot both that, and his fathers Legacy; intangling
himself and them in a tedious and bloody war: from which he was compelled to
desist with loss of men, money, and credit. So that now the country is divided
between the States, and the Archduchesse.

The States have under their Aristocraticall government, the Duchy of
Gueldre^. 2 the Earledomes of Holland. 3 Zeland, and 4 Z^tphen. 5 The Lordships
of Freizland. 6 Vt^echt. 7 Overyssell. and 8 Groyning. This is the lesser part
by far, and more poor in respect of the soil: but more populous, and by the
industry of the people, ^arre more rich. They keep about 30000 Soldiers in
continual Garrison; whose pay together with their Officers and Captains
wages, amounts to 500000l yearly, or thereabout, which is raised by taxes
from all commodities, victuals, and the like. The LL the States are chosen for
every Province one: the common counsel of every particular Province is
collected out of the Towns and principal Villages. The Council of the
particular Provinces, resideth in the principal Towns of such Provinces: but
the Council of the General States resideth continually at the Hage in
Holland: in which Council Maurice Prince of Orange, and the Ambassador, or
Leiger for England, have their places, and voices, a^ members of it; and that
as free and binding as the general estates themselves.

Here live, but not with open exercise of religion, almost as many Jews,
Anabaptists, Papists, So^inians, and the like, as Protestants; if not more. For
since all s^rts spent their blood, lost their friends, and consumed their
estate against the common enemy in war; good reason they should enjoy the
blessings of peace. Notwithstanding they are not called to government, or any
public charge; such offices being always conferred on the reformed. The
Captain General of all their forces, is Maurice of Nassaw, Prince of Orange,
a valiant and expert leader.

The profits which the Archduke reapeth from his part of the country, are not
great: his Soldiers pay is great, and he is loath by taxes and other the like
burdens, to exasperat the people, incite them to another rebellion, or startle
their resolutions to some farther designs against his quiet.

For the better historifying the breach of these Countries, from the kings of
Spain, I will ascend to the beginning of the house of Burgund^e. That the
Duchy, and County of Burgundy, formerly divided, were united by the
marriage of Ioane the Countess, with Duke Eudes 1331; as also how they were
given by King Charles the fifth to his brother Philip the hardy, A^ 1369: we
have before related. This Philip took to wi^e Margaret, daughter to John d^
Malaine, Earl of Flanders; and in her right succeeded in that Earldom, Anno
1383. Under his successors, especially Philip the good (under whom most of the
Belgicke Provinces became united) the subjects of Be^gia and Burgundy so
abounded in wealth; that Comines, who then lived, says, that these Signeuries
seemed like the Land of promise: the people being in their apparel,
excessiuely gorgeous; in their banquets over sumptuous; in their manners,
dissolute: vices usually accompanying this kind of felicity. Charles the
warlike made an end of this happiness, by warring on king Lewis the 11th; for
though he kept the war from his own home, yet after his death at the battle
of Nancie; the French king bereft his successor the Lady Mary of the Duchy of
Burgundy, and many Towns and Lordships in Picardie; besides the greatest part
of the Duchy of Artoys. This Mary, married Maxim^lian Archduke of Austria,
with whom having lived about 5 years she brake her thigh with a fall from her
horse; and in a woma^ly modesty, chose rather to dye, then to permit any
Chirurgian to dress her there where she was hurt. In her ended the house of
Burgundy; the rights of these Provinces being translated into the house of
Austria, and from thence to Spain: which happened by the marriage of Philip,
son to Mary, with Joan, daughter and heir to Ferdinand, and Isabell, who
then possessed all the continent of Spain, Portugal excepted. During the
g^uernment of this Philip, Charles his son, and Philip his grandchild; these
Countries, especially Luxenbourg, Hainal^, and Artoys, were ransacked and
harrowed by the French: with whom these Princes were continually in war. But
when a Truce was made between Spain, and France; then began King Philip to
cast his thoughts on the subjection of this people to his will and pleasure. For
they were so fortified and insconced, as it were, with privileges, which their
former Princes had granted, and the latter were sworn to observe; that he
found himself to want much of that free and uncontrollable power, L. Guic^.
which his violent spirit seemed every where to desire. Some of these
immunities we^e, that the Prince could place no stranger amongst them, either
in offices of war or justice. 2ly, The Prince could give nothing to the
Clergy: nor 3ly, leavie no Subsidies without the States of the Country. But the
maine prerogative was, that if the Prince by violence or wrong, did infringe
any of the said Charters and Franchises; the people after their declaration
there of made, Sr R. Wi^.
may go to election of a new Prince. This not a little grieved the Spaniards,
that such base and unworthy people (for so they esteemed them) should in such
liberty possess so brave and rich a Country; their King bearing no title of
majesty, or absolute command over them. Besides the reformation of Religion,
which then began to grow to some strength, moved the King to reduce the^ by
Spanish Rhetoric (that is by the Sword and the Cannon) to the Romish Church.
To these ends he sent the Duke of Alua, an old and expert Captain, as having
60 years been a Soldier, with a puissant army, to be his Viceroy among
them. He gave him also a commission of that large extent, that he might place
and displace whom he would, and execute all such as he found opposite to his
designs. At that time the two chief men were the Prince of Orange, and Count
Egmont; the first was more potent with the people, the latter with the
Soldiers. Had these two joined together, they might easily have prevented D.
Alba's entrance; but Egmont was so soothed up with letters from Spain, that he
believed not the intelligence which the Prince had, concerning the Dukes
Commission. The Earl exhorted the Prince to submit himself to the pleasure of
the King, and so to prevent the ruin of his house: the Prince desired the
Earl to maintain the liberty of his country; as for himself, he had rather
be a Prince without an house, then a Count without an head. Being thus
resolved, the Prince retires to his friends of Nassaw, in high Germany; the
Earl stays to congratulate the entrance of the new Governor: Who had no
sooner settled himself, but he intrapped the Counts of Horn, and Egmont, and
beheaded them. Anno 1567. Being thus rid of these two, with diverse others of
good quality; who living would much have hindered his proceedings; he quartered
his Spaniards in the Towns and Prov^nces, spoiled the people not of their
privileges only, but their liberty; among the reformed he brought in the
bloody Inquisition; and indeed so tyrannically did he behave himself, that the
people were forced to a defensive war, as well for their lives as substances.
This was a war of State, not Religion; the most part of the Hollanders being
Papists, at the time of their taking Arms. During these troubles, the Prince
of Orange was not idle; but he in one place, and Count Lodowicke his brother,
in another; kept D. Alva employed: though diverse times not with such fortunate
success, as the cause deserved. In the year 1572, Flushing was surprised by
Voorst, and Berland, as we have before said. So also was the Brill in Voorne,
an Island of Holland, by the Count de la March: And not long after, all Holland,
except Amsterdam, followed the fortune and side of the Prince, together with
all of the Towns of Zealand, Middlebourg excepted. Anno 1573 D'Alba being
recalled, Don Lewis de Requis^ns was appointed Governor, during whose rule,
many of the Belgians abandoned their Country, some flying into Germany, others
into France, Hist. of Ne^
most into England. After his death, and before the arrival of Don John, the
Prince and his party recovered strength and courage again, till the coming of
the Duke of Parma, who brought them into worse case then ever. Yet Anno 1581.
they declare by their writings directed to all people, that Philip of ^paine
was fallen from the government; and take a new oath of the people, which bound
them never to return to the Spanish obedience. This done, they elect Francis
Duke of Aniou, heir apparent to the French king, and then in no small hopes of
marrying our Queen, to be their Lord. But he intending rather to settle a
tyrann^e in himself, then to drive it from the Spaniard, attempted Antwerpe,
put his men into the town, but was by the valor of the Burgers shamefully
repulst. Shame of this ignoble enterprise, especially grief for its ill
success* took him out of the world. The State of these countries was then thus
by his Hieroglyphick, expressed. A cow represen^ed ^he body of Belgia, there
stood the King of Spain spurring her; the Queen of England ^eeding her, the
Prince of Orange m^lking her; And Duke Francis plucking her back by the tail,
but she soul'd his fingers. During his unfortunate government, Parma prevailed
in all places, especially after the death of William Prince of Orange;
treacherously slain with a Pistol, Ao 1584. Now were the poor Hollanders
truly miserable, having none to lead them, none to protect them; but such as
were likely to regard their own good, more then theirs. England was then only
sanctuary they had now left, to her they sue, offering the Queen thereof, the
sovereignty of their Provinces; who had if not a true, yet a plausible title to
them; As being lineallly descended from Edward the th^rd, and Philip his wi^e,
who was sis^^r, (and (as some say heir) to Wllliam Earl of Hainalt, Holland*
etc. If Margar^t, from whom the right of Spain is de^iued, were Daughter to
Earl William, then was our Queen to succeed after Philip, who was rejected:
if that Margaret were (as many w^ite) his younger sister, then was our Queen the
undoubted heir, her Predecessor Philippa, being Earl Williams eldest sister.
Our Heroic Queen not disputing the right of the title, nor intending to her
self any thing, save the honor of relieuing her distressed neighbors; like a
true Defen^resse of the Faith, took them into her protection. Under which, the
Belgian affairs succeeded so prosperously (I will not now stand on
particulars) that before they would hearken to any treaty of peace, they forced
the King of Spain to confess, that they were a people so free, that he had no
right to the place, which they were possessed of. This peace was concluded,
Anno 1609: Since which time, they have kept garrisons well disciplined, and as
well paid. So that these Countries have (in these late days) bin the Campus
Martius, or School of defense for all Ch^istendome; to which the youth of all
Nations repair, to see the manner of fortifications, and learn the Art of
war. The people hereof have for 40 years held the sta^^e against a most
puissant Monarch, and have with so great advantage capitulated, that it is
observed, where all other Nations grow poor with war, these only grow rich.
Whereupon it is remarkable to consider into what follies and extremities
Princes run, by using their people to the wars. The Kings of France place
most of their hopes in their Cavalrie; because in policy they would not that
the vulgar should be exercised in arms. Lycurgus gave a law to the
Lacedaemonians, that they should never fight often with one enemy: the breaking
whereof made the Thebans a small Commonwealth, to be their equals in power.
The Turks won this vast Empire they now possess, by making many, and speedy
wars: but now that policy being worn out of fashion; we see that (to omit
Persia) the little and distracted kingdom of Hungary, has for even almost 200
years, resist^d them. So was it between the Dukes of Austria, and the
Switzers; and so it is betwixt the Spaniard, and Low-countrymen; Arch. Ab.
who being formerly accounted a dull and heavy people, altogether unfit for the
wars: by their continual combating with the Spaniard, are become ingenious,
full of action, and great managers of causes appertaining to fights, either by
sea or land. We may hereby also perceive what advantages a small State gains,
by fortifying places and passages: there being nothing which sooner hinders a
great Prince, then to beleaguer a well fortified town: for that herein he
consumes his time, and commonly loses his men, credit, and money: as the
Romans before Numantia; the great Turk in Malta; and Charles of Burgundy
before Nancie. For where war is drawn out of the field unto the walls, the
Mattock and Spade being more necessary then the Sword and Spear: there the
valor of the assailants is little available, because it wants its proper
object.

Since the uniting of most of these Provinces, these have bin the Lords of
Belgia. Hist. of Net.

OF GERMANY.
Maginus.
GERMANY is bounded on the West with France and Be^gia; on the North with
Denmark and her seas; on the East wit^ Prussia, Poland, and Hungary: on the
South with the Alps. It was so called (as some think) by the Roman^, who
passing over Rhene to satisfy his eye in seeing foreign countries, or to
enrich himself with the spoil of an unfriendly Nation, seeing the people so
like unto the Gauls in speech, man^ers, and complexion, called them the
Germane to the French. Others do derive it from ^er, which signifies all; and
man: whence also came the name of Almayne, as well as that of Germane. By this
Etymology they would imply, that the Almaines or Germans are a very warlike
Nation; as a people that have in the^, nihil nisi virile, nothing weak or
womanish, nor indeed any thing not worthy a man. B^t it is by others as
probably conjectured, that they are called Almanes or Germans, because they
consist of so many several nations, coming out of the North and North-East
hither, that they seem to be an hotchpot or mixture of all kinds of men,
kn^aded into one name and country: and this is the conceit of Asinius Qu^dratus.

The compass of this spacious country, is 2600 English miles: the figure is
almost an exact square, each side being in length 650 miles. It is situate in
the Northern temperat Zone, vn^^r the 7^^ and 11th Climates, the longest day
being 17 (...), and a half.

I^ is supposed to contain 10 millio^s of people: the men of the po^^e^ sor^,
laborious, painfu^l, and of sincere behavior: the Nobles either profound
scholars, Boter. relat.

otherwise, saying; the (...) liberty, the Belgians for honors, the Germans

The women are of a good complexion, though by reason of their intemperance in
eating and drinking, they are somewhat corpulent: women (as they say) of good
carriage, good bea^ers, and good breeders.

The diet of Germany, Italy, and that of France, is thus censured: the Germans
have much meat, View of Fr.
but sluttishly dressed; the French little, but cleanly handled; the Italians
neither one nor the other.

The titles of the Fathers descend to all the children, every son of a Duke,
being a Duke; and every daughter a Duchess: a thing which the Italians hold
so ridiculous, that they put it in the forefront of this facetious Satyr. The
Dukes and Earls of Germany, the Dons of Spain, the Monsieurs of France, the
Bishops of Italy, the Nobility of Hungary, the Lairdes of Scotland, the Knights
of Naples, and the younger brethren of England, make a poor company. For by
this common assuming of the Fathers honor, and parting his lands among all the
brethren; the Nobility is beyond reason multiplied, Morison.
and no less impouerisht: there being not long since, 17 Princes of Anhalt,
and 27 Counts of Mansfield; to most of which, their Arms have bin the best
part of their riches, and nihil nisi arma and manus, and in his omnia, as
Tacitus once said of the Britains.

Their language being the Dutch, has less commixture with the Latin, then
any which is used in the Western parts, and is very harsh, by reason of its
many consonants.

Tacitus accounted this country rude and barren, as then co^taining nothing but
unpeopled Forests, vprofitable Heaths, and unhealthful pooles: but were he
now alive, he would be forced to sing a Palinodia, confessing it to be both
pleasing, healthful and profitable; abounding with Mines of Silver, and
inferior metals; plentiful in Corn and Wines, which they transport into
other Countries; together with fresh fish, Linnens, Quicksiluer, Alum,
Armours, and other iron-workes, The Arable lands are in the East parts so
spacious, that the husbandman going forward with his plough in the morning,
turns not back again till it be midday. So making his whole days work, but
two ploughed furrows; one in his going forward, the other in his return, as
Verstegan relates.

In former times this Country yielded neither good Captain, nor good Scholar;
the later both, but especially the Scholar, as Albertus Magnus the Physician,
and great Philosopher; who made the Statua of a man, which by the operation of
inward artificial engines, could speak very articulately, and was the work of
30 years: Appian the Cosmographer, Gesner the Philosopher, Munster, Luther,
Vrsinus, Zuinglius, Scultetus, and Iunius, with many other Divines, besides
Keckerman, Alstedius, Timpler, Munster.
Goclenius, etc. To those let me add Bertholdus Swart, if not for his
learning, yet for one of his inventions; being that fatal instrument, called
the Gunne. This Swarte was a Franciscan, and studious in Alohymie. For the
finding out of experiments in this Art, he was one evening tempering brimstone,
dried earth, and certain other ingredients, in a mortar, which he covered with
a stone. The night growing on, he took a tinderbox to light him a candle; where
striking fire, a spark by chance flew into the mortar, and catching hold of the
brimstone, and saltpeter, with great violence blew up the stone. The cunning
Alchymist guessing which of his ingredients it was that produced this effect,
made him an iron pipe, crammed it with sulphur, and stones; and putting fire
to it, saw with what great fury and noise it discharged it self. This
Invention he communicated to the Venetians, Guicciard.
Anno 1330, or thereabouts; who having bin often vanquished by the Genewaies,
and driven almost to a necessity of yielding to them: by the help of these
Gunnes, (Bombards they were then called) gave unto their enemies a notable
discomfiture. And this was the first battle that ever those warlike pieces
had a part in: which not long after, put to silence all the engines and dev^ces,
where with the Ancients were wont to make their bat^erie. The next that made
use of this Instrument, were the inhabitants of the Balticke sea: Camd. Re^.
and not long after them, the English, at the siege of Calice, Anno 1347; about
which time they began also to be used in Spain. The French, it seems,
learned the use of them from the English; and the first benefit received by
them, was the death of that famous Leader, Thomas Montacute, Earl of
Salisbury, who at the siege of Orleance, was slain with a great shot, Anno
1425. The Turbes are beholding for them to the wars they had with the
Venet^an^; beholding I say, Turk. hist.
for notwithstandi^g the harms received by them at first; yet afterward
growing expert in managing of the^, they gave unto Vffin Cassares, and Hismael,
two of the most mighty Emperors of Persia, two memorable overthrows, by the
help of their great Ordinance only. The Portugals were in this Art, the Tutors
to the Persians: for as Solomon the (...) Emperor objected against them, they
not only aided (...) the Sophie with certain h^rcabagiers; but also sent him
workmen to show him the use and making of Artillery. These great pieces at the
first invention were rude, unwieldy, and charged with stone bullets only: but
by degree, they come to that perfection, both for the wall and the hard, that
they (...) Whether now Archerie or Gunning be to be protected, I stand not here
to determine: only this I am sure of, that victories have been of late
purchased with less expense of life and blo^d, then ever in former times they
were. But of this theme m^^e hereafter.

The Religion here is diverse, Jews being intermingled with Christians, these
divided into Pap^sts and Pr^testants. These latter also are divided into
Lutherans and Calvi^ists, who though in all things opposite to the Romish
Church, are yet in some few, contrary one to the other: the Lutheran
maintaining consubstantiation in the blessed Eucharist, with omnipresen^e: and
eternal predestination, to be out of a fore-scene faith and good works, and
not absolute. Which tenants not (...) to the word of the most High, are

Boterus reckons the Revenues of the (...)lions, which indeed were true,

Throne, but that they may be utterly di(...), reason they should be admitted
into the reckoning. (...)tiles are parts of the Empire, but acknowledge no
subjection* as Denmark, Switzerland, and the Seventeen Provinces; Some again
acknowledge a kind of subjection, but come not to the Diets, as some Italian
Potentates, the Dukes of Lorreine and Savoy; and some both confess the
Emperors sovereignty, and come to all Councels, namely the German Princes;
who all pay certain moneys, which they count a contribution, but no tribute.
The cities of this country are of 3 sorts, Hansetownes, which enjoy large
pr^uiledges and immunities, Morison*
and are in number 72: such are Lubecke, Hambourg, Madenbourg: Each of which is
able to put to sea 150 good Ships. The second sort are they which are holden by
inheritance of some Princes. The third sort are the Free or Imperial cities:
Free for their great prerogatives of coining moneys, and ruling by their own
laws; Imperial, as knowing no Lord or protector, but the Emperor; to whom
they pay two third parts of such contributions, as are assessed in the
assemblies, and about 1500 Florens yearly, for themselves and their
territories. This revenue as it is certainly known not to be very great, so
cannot we certainly know how great or little. These cities enjoying so many
privileges, and having so full a command over the neighboring country, and
the villages thereof, are exceeding rich and potent. I will instance only in
Norimberg, by which we may guess at the rest: and in Norimberg also I can but
aim at the whole wealth, by a particular loss, which was thus. Ao 1554. when
Maeurice Duke of Saxony, Sleid. Com.
and his associats, had driven the Emperor Charles out of Germany, Albert
Marquess of Brandenbourg, whose sword was in a manner his law, and his
revenue, besieged this City: He burnt 100 of the villages belonging to it, 70
manors and sermes appertaining to the citizens: 3000 acres of wood: and after
all this spoil, compoundeth with them for 200000 crowns, and six pieces of
Ordinance. As for the Religion in these free and Imperial towns professed, it
is in a manner totally the reformed; there being 3 only, which adhere wholly
to the Church of Rome, which are Gmond, Vberlinque, or Whirlingen, and
Dinkelspuhel; three small towns in the lower Suevia, and in some few of the
rest, both religions are permitted. In brief these are called free Cities (as
Guicciardine the Historian defines them) which acknowledging by a certain
determinate tribute, the authority of the Empire, do notwithstanding in all
other things, govern themselves after their own laws: not seeking to amplify
their territories, but to defend their liberties. They are in number 60, as
Francsort, Norimberg, with the rest: which together with the Princes in time of
wars, are to aid the Emperor with 3842 horse, and 16300 foot; but how small
a triste is that, in respect of so huge a Country.

The principal rivers are 1 Danubius, which rising out of Nigrasylva, and
receiving amongst others, 60 navigable rivers, disgorgeth his full stomach out
of his 7 mouths, into the Euxine seas, after it has streamed along for the
space of 1500 miles. Cedere Danubius se tibi Nile negat.
O seuen-mouth'd Nile I plainly see,
Danow will scarce give way to thee.
2 Rhene, which arising in Helvetia, and running through Germany and Belgia,
after a course of 800 miles, saluteth the Germane Ocean; into which also
runs 3 the Albis, after a journey of more then 400 miles; rising about the
lowest skirts of Bohemia, and passing by Madenberg, Brunswicke, and Denmark. 4
Odera which has his fountain in the hithermost con^in^s of Silesia; and after
it has run a s^lent course through Brandenbourg, and Pomerania, of some 300
miles in length; opens his wide mouth in the Balticke sea. 5 Maenus. 6

About 130 years after the universal deluge, and not long after the confusion
of tongues at Babell, Munster.
(if we may believe what we find recorded) one Teuto the son of Gomer, came
into Germany; of whom the people of his posterity were called Teutones: by
which name, many of them were known to the Romans, though not without a
miscellaneous admixture of others; as the Cha^ti, Cherusci, Suevi, and the
like. Caesar opened the way for the Romans to this country, the conquest
whereof was brought to best perfection by him, who for his happy victories, was
meritoriously named Germanicus. It continued Roman until the days of Phocas;
when France, Spain, and Germany, at a clap shaked off all allegiance to the
Empire; so detestable is a tyrannical usurper, that even barbarous and ignoble
spirits abhor his government. Germany being now slipped from its former
bondage, was distracted into many petty royalties; all or most of which, were
extinguished by the greater light of the French Monarchy, under Pepin and
Charles, Kings of France: the latter being for his many services to the Church,
made Emperor of the West, containing under its command, part of Spain, and
Italy, all France, and Germany, which last has bin the seat of most of his
successors. So that now the prophecy of the Druides, concerning the removing
of the Empire into these parts, seems to have bin fulfilled, though Tacitus
in his time accounted it a vain and idle prediction. For when Civilis raised a
rebellion in Germany against Vespasian, then newly made Emperor; possessionem
rerum humanarum Transalpinis gentibus portendi, superstitione vana Druidae
canebant. And by this erecting of the Western Empire, we see the prophecy to
have bin good; though it was not so soon fulfilled, as was expected. The

was the last of the blood of Charles the great: for the Francones and the
Saxones, seeing Charles the simple King of France, wholly possessed with the
Normans; took that advantage, and chose an Emperor of their own blood: a
worthy Prince questionless they made choice of, Muster.

After the death of this Emperor, all right of succession disclaimed, the
Emperors became elective; whereby the Princes have grown potent: But the
Empire weak, voices being obtained, not according to the worthiness of virtue,
but by gifts, to the prejudice of the Imperial Majesty. This decree of
election was confirmed by Pope Gregory the fi^t, and the power given to the
Count Palatine of Rhene, Archsewer; the Duke of Saxony, Lord Marshall; and the
Marquess of Brandenburg, chief Chamberlain of the Temporalties; amongst the
spiritualty, to the Archbishop of Mentz, Chancellor of the Empire; to the
Archbishop of Collen, Chancellor of Italy to the Archbishop of Triers,
Chancellor of France: and if equality of voices happened, the Duke of Bohemia,
(but now King) had the binding voice, who by office is chief cup bearer. These
Offices on days of especial solemnity, are performed after this manner.
Gelden Bull.
Before the gate of the Emperor stands an heap of oats so high, that it
reaches to the breast of the horse, whereon the D. of Saxony rides: who
bears in his hand a silver wand, and a silver measure, both which together,
weigh 200 marks of silver. Then sitting on his horse, he fills that measure
with oats, and sticking his silver staffe^in the remainder, he goes together
with the Emperor into the Palace; having first given his measure of oats to
any of his servants which stands next unto him. When the Emperor is entered
the Palace, and is sat down at his Table, the 3 spiritual Electours standing
orderly together, say grace. Then the Marquess of Brandenbourg coming on
horseback with a silver basin (weighing 12 marks of silver) full of water, in
his hand, and a fine clean towell on his arm, lights down, and gives the
Emperor water to wash his hands. After him the Palatine of the Rhene comes
on horseback, with 4 silver platters in his hands, full of meat; who lighting
from his horse, carries, and sets them down on the table; every platter
weighing three marks. Last of all, the King of Bohemia, riding on a horse,
with a napkin on his arm, and a covered cup in his hand, weighing 12 marks,
enters the great Hall; where lighting down, he gives the cup to the
Emperor to drink.


The election is usually holden at Francfort on Maenus, Sleid. Com.
whither the Electours or their deputies come upon the day appointed by the
Bishop of Mentz, whose office it is to assemble the Princes. In their passage
unto Francfort, they are guarded by every Prince, through whose territories
they pass. Their attendants must not exceed the number of 200 horsemen whereof
50 only must be armed. When they are all met, they go to St Bartholmewes
Church; where after Mass said, the spiritual Electours laying their hands on
their breasts, and the temporal on their book, shall swear to choose a fit
temporal head for the people of Christendom. If in the space of 30 days they
have not agreed, then must they eat nothing but bread and water, nor by any
means go out of the city, till the greater part have agreed on a man, who
shall forth with be acknowledged King of the Romans.

The inauguration is holden first at Aken in Gulick, where the new elected
Emperor receives the silver Crown for Germany: secondly at Millaine, where he
receives his iron Crown for Lombardy. Thirdly at Rome, where he receives the
golden Crown for the Empire. These constitutions were made by Charles the 4th,
and called the Golden Bull, or Aurea Bulla, Anno 1356. The first chosen
Emperor was 1002 15 Henricus II. Claudus and Sanctus 22 1025 16 Conradus II.
Salicus 15 1040 17 Henricus III. Niger 17 1057 18 Henricus IV. senior 50. In
the days of this Prince, the Roman Prelates began to usurp authority over
Kings and Emperors. Leo the ninth having received the Papacy of the Emperors
hands, repented himself, put off his purp^e, went to Rome as a private man, and
was again elected by the Clergy. This was done by the persuasion of
Hildebrand a Monk, who being afterward Pope Gregory the seventh,
excommunicated this Henry; being the first Prince that ever was excommunicated:
from this time, till the year 1254, was there continual wars, and thunders,
between the Popes, and the nine following Emperors. 1107 19 Henricus V. junior

Henry the 3 of England* was chosen and crowned King of the Romans; and after
he had supported a ruinous Empire 6 years, he returned into England, where he
died. In the times of these last Emperors, the politic Bishops of Rome, had
in a manner forced the Emperors out of Italy; so that Rodolfus the next
Emperor, sold all his right in Italy to diverse Princes. The craft of the Popes
extended yet farther, even into Germany; where by granting royal prerogatives
to the tributary Princes, they much weakened the state of the Empire: It was
utterly ruined by Venceslaus, who sold Lombardie to the Visconti of Millaine;
and gave to the Princes many possessions of the Empire, for their favors in
his election; which they then willingly received, and since powerfully
defended; few of them not being able to wage war^e with the Emperors
themselves. Sleid. Com.
Charles the fifth, was questionless the most puissant Emperor from Charles
the Great, as being King of Spain, Lord of all Belgia, King of Naples, Duke of
Millaine, and Austria; yet his inability to match with some of those ruffling
Princes, was not the least cause of his resignation to his brother Ferdinand.
But to proceed: After a 12 years interegnum, was chosen 1273 30 Rodol.

II. 35 1610 46 Matthias. 1619 47 Ferdinand. II. Being the ninth of the house of
Austria, without intermission. The cause of which is to be attributed to
Charles the fifth, who procured in his lifetime, that his brother might be
chosen Rex Romanorum, as his successor. Now Rex Romanorum is defined to be
one, who is already so far estated in the Empire, that on the death,
deposition, or resignation of the present Emperor, he is immediately to
succeed. This definition may pass, though there be no necessity of the Rex
Roma^orum into the Empire. For Charles the fifth, though he made his brother
King of the Romaens, Sleid. Com.
had no small hopes to have left his son Philip his successor iu the Empire:
for fear of which, it was by many thought, that his brother lent D. Mau^ice a
helping hand, to drive him out of Germany. The reason why Charles did
institute this Rex Romanorum, was questionless a desire to perpetuate the
sovereignty in his own house; but his pretenses were 1, because he having the
command of many Nations, could not always be present in Germany. 2ly the
troubled State of Christendom, by reason of Luthers preaching, especially
there; 3ly the violent power of the Turks, who now began to be nigh neighbors
unto them; 4ly the late rural wars, raised by the Boores, and scarce yet
thoroughly extinct; and 5ly an imminent disobedience in every part of the
Empire, seemed to require a powerful coadjutor. The wise Duke of Saxony,
through all these fair pretenses, truly saw the maine plot; which was to make
Germany (as Galba in his excellent oration to Piso, said of the Roman Empire)
unius quasi familiae haereditatem: and therefore he first flatly denied to
yield to any such institution. Then he motioned that there might be an act
made, to prohibit the continuance of the Imperial authority, longer in one
family, then for 3 successions: But prevailing in neither, he left the
Electours: by whom Ferdinand was chosen, and not long after crowned at Aken or
Aquisgrane in Cleueland, the 16 of January, Anno 1531. This policy has bin
ever since continued by his successors, to which the Germans are more
willing; because the Austrian Princes are natives of the Country, and able to
back out the Empire, in its complete countenance of Majesty.


The Arms of the Empire, Bara.
are Sol, an Eagle displayed with two heads Saturn, armed and crowned Mars.
The two heads signify the East and West Empire: whereof the one is quite
plucked off, and the other stripped of all its feathers; the Imperial dignity
being grown little more, then titularie.

The chief Pro^inces of Germany are 1 East-Friezland, 2 Westphalia 3
Cleu^land. 4 Alsatia. 5 Franconia. 6 Helvetia. 7 Suevia. 8 Bavaria. 9 Austria.
10 Bohemia. 11 Brandenburg. 12 Saxony. 13 Pomerania and Mecklenburg. 14
Brunswick and Luneb^urg. 15 Hassia; some of which, Aubanus thus censureth. They
of Suevia are whoores; they of Franconia, rauishers and beggars; they of
Bohemia, heretics: they of Bavaria, thieves; they of Helvetia bawdes; they of
Saxony, fudlers: they of Frisia and Westphalia, swearers: and they of the
Rhene are gluttons.

1 EAST-FREIZLAND.
EAST-FRIEZLAND is bounded on the West with the Ems, on the East with the
Woser, on the South with Westphalia, on the North with the Sea. The old
inhabitants were the Cauchi: the chief Towns are 1 Emden, so called of the
Ems, on which it is seated. This Town has of late expelled their Earl, and
govern as a petty Commonwealth, making Religion but a mask to disguise
unnatural rebellions. 2 Amm^r Dun. 3 Oldenbourg, which has an Earl of its
own; a family sufficiently famous, in that the Kings of Denmark are descended
from it, ever since Christian, Earl of this place, was chosen King of that
country, Anno 1448. 4 Anselinge, etc.

The first Earl of East-Freizland was Ezardus, Anno 1466; his predecessors
being only Captains of the Country: Reusner.
the present Count is Gustanus, who Anno 1592, was driven out of Emden, because
he favored the Lutherans, rather then the Calvinists.

2 WESTPHALIA.
WESTPHALIA was the habitation of the old Saxons, until by Charles the Great,
they were brought into narrower compass: and though now also this name is not
of so large extent as it has bin, yet we will take it as it was at the
biggest, when it was bounded on the East with Brunswicke, on the West with
Belgia, on the North with the Sea, on the South with Hassia. The soil
abounds with all fruits, and is wonderfully stored with Acornes; which feed
Swine of an exceeding pleasant taste and nourishment, so that a Westphal^an
Gammon of Bacon, is the chief dish at a Banquet. The Northern part of this
Country is called Bremen, from the chief City Breme, the Bishop whereof is
Lord of this Tract. The next parts belong to the Dukes of Saxony, the chie^e
Cities of which are 1 Clappenburg. 2 Exenberg. 3 Als^orpe etc. The other part
belongs to the Bishopric of Collen, Munster, and Triers.

The Bishopric of Collen contains a great part of Westphalen, and was once
belonging to Lorreine, till the da^es of Otho 2d: Who giving Lorreine to
Charles of France, extracted great possessions from it; which he gave to the
Bishop of Collen. The former inhabitants were the Vbij, Munster.
who were converted to Christianity, by Maternus the Disciple of St Peter, Anno
70. Their chie^e City was Vbiopolis, afterward called Agrippina, in honor of
Agrippina, Nero's mother: and lastly Collen, of the French, who there planted a
colonie. Nigh unto this city did Caesar with incredible expedition make a
bridge over the Rhene, which more terrified the barbarous enemy, then the
reports of his valor; so powerful is laborious industry, that it overcomes
all disasters, and makes the most impassable waters, yield to Heroicke
resolutions. The Archbishop of this city is the second spiritual Electour of
the Emperor, and Chancelour of Italy. In this town (as it is supposed) are
nigh 100 private Schools. In this Town also are said to lie the bodies of the
three wise men, which came from the East to worship our Savior, vulgarly
called the three Kings of Collen. The whole story is at large written in
tables, which are fastened unto the Tombs. The pith whereof is this. The first
of them called Melchior, an old man with a long beard, offered gold as unto a
King. The second called Gaspar, a beardlesse young man, offered Frankincense as
unto God* The third called Balthazar, a blackmoore with a spreading beard,
offered Mirrh, as unto a man ready for his Sepulcher. That they were of Arabia,
the table says is probable; first, because they came from the East, and so is
Aribia in respect of Jerusalem. 2ly, because it is said in the 72 Psalm, The
Kings of Ar^bia shall bring gifts. As for their bodies, they are the^e said to
have been translated by Helena, the mother of Constantine; unto
Constan^inople: from thence by Eustor^ius, Bishop of Millaine, unto Millaine;
and finally brought hither by Rainoldus Bishop hereof Ano 1164. This is the
substance of the history, which for my part I reckon among the Apocrypha. The
other Towns under the dominion of this Bishop are 1 Ernace, or Andernach, (
Marcellinus calls it Antennacum) one of the 10 Garrison; erected on the bank
of Rhene by Caesar. 2 Lints, seated on the Rhene, as also is 3 B^nna, where the
Bishop has a Palace, which is esteemed to be one of the fairest houses of
Germany. And 4 Mondenand. The Bishopp of Collen, writes himself Duke of
Westphalia, and Angiuaria, which last is a but a part of the first.

The chief Towns under the Bishop of Munster are, 1 Warendorp. 2 Herwerden.
and 3 Munster, Sleid, Com.
seated on the river of Ems, and so called of a Monastery built there by
Charles the great. In this Town about the year 1533, a lawless crew of
Anabaptists assembled, chose themselves a King, whom they called the King of
Sion; and the City they named new Jerusalem: but by the industry of the
Bishop, this tumult was appeased, their King and his chief accomplices
deservedly punished. To epitomize the story would quite spoil it, and
therefore I refer the reader to the 10th book of Sleidans Commentaries, who
excellently, and at large describes, the beginning, progress, and end of this
fanaticall kingdom.

Munster.
The chief Towns belonging to the Bishop of Triers are 1 Bopport, seated on
the Moselle, and so called quasi bon port, a safe harbor. It was once
miserably wasted by Richard Earl of Cornwall, and King of the Romans; because
the Bishop of Triers had opposed his election. 2 Engers, pawned together with
Bopport, to the Bishops of this Diocese, by the Emperor Henry the 7th. 3
Coblents, anciently called Confluentia, because it is built at the con^luence
of the Rhene, and the Moselle. and 4 Treveris, or Triers, a City seated in an
air so clowdy, and subject to rain; that it is by some merrily called Cloaca
planetarum^. This is the chief seat of the Chancellor of France, and third
spiritual Electour: it is built on the Moselle, and is so ancient, that it is
recorded to have been built 150 years before Rome. To this Bishop also
belongs the fair and sumptuous Castle of Hermenstemie.

3 CLEVELAND.
This Duchy contains, 1 Cleue. 2 Gulicke. 3 Berge. The Duchy of CLEVE
joins to Gelderland. The chief Cities are 1 Cleue. 2 Calker. 3 Wesell. 4
Emericke. Here dwelt the Cherusci, who slew three Legions and their Captain
Qui^tilius Varus. This discomfiture, Suetonius,
partly by the loss of so many of his Soldiers; partly by the ignominy thence
received; and withal that grief had been of long a Non-resident with him: so
distracted Augustus, that he was seen to tear his beard, and knock his head
against the posts, crying, read mihi Legiones Quintili Vare* In this
overthrow the Barbarians seized on two of the Roman Eagles, the third being
cast into the Fennes by the standard bearer; which inforceth Cuspinianus and
that not improbably, to guess, that the Arms of Germany should be two Eagles
conjoined, and not one with two heads.

Cleue was made an Earldom Anno 911: Munster
and for want of heirs diuolued into the Empire Ao 1350, in the time of
Charles the fourth: who not long after gave it to Adolfe Bishop of Collen; it
may be for his favor in raising his son Wenceslaus to the Empire: His son
also named Adolfe, was by Sigismond the Emperor made Duke of Cleue Anno 1417.
This Dukedom is now united unto the Marquisate of Brandenburg, by marriage of
the sister of John the last Duke, unto Albert a Marquess of Brand^nburg. But
the Marquess inioyeth not the least part of it. For the other pretendants
hereunto, to make their side good, besought aid of the Spaniards; whereby the
Marquess was enforced to call in the States of the Lowcountries, by which
means the Spaniard possessed himself of Cleue; and the States of Berge and
Gulicke: leaving the true owner small joy in these his new possessions.

The Arms are Gules, Bara.
a Carbuncle Or, on an Eschotcheon in ^esse, Argent.

2 The Duchy of GVLICK, or Iuliacum, was anciently inhabited by the Menapij
and Eburones. The chief Cities are, 3 Aquisgranum or Aken, where the Emperor
after his election is inucsted with the silver Crown of Germany. Tacitus.
This town was formerly that wintring camp of the Romans called Vetera, which
was taken by Civilis in the beginning of his rebellion against Vespasian:
during which wars it is often mentioned by the writers of those times. They
were built and strengthened by Augustus, the better to keep under the Germans:
quippe illis bybernis obsideri premique, G^rmanias Augustus crediderat. At this
day this Town and ^r^ers are reputed famous for holy relics; here being among
others ^he bearing cloth wherein our Savior was wrapped when he was in his
swaddling clouts: which the Emperor solemnly worshippeth at his inauguration
Concerning the ambition which the Papists have to be thought possessours of
these relics; See, I beseech you, how pitifully they have mangled the head
of St John Baptist. They of Amiens brag that they have his face, and so do
they of St John D Angelie. The rest of his head is at Malta, yet is the h^nder
part of his skull at Namours, and his brain at Nouum R^stourense. Another part
of it is at Maurienn^, another piece at Paris; his law at Wesell, his ^are at
S. Flowers, his forehead and hair at S. Salvadores in Venice; another piece of
his head is at Noyon, and another at Luca; yet is his whole head entire and
vnmaimed in St Sylvesters Church at Rome: and so no doubt is this bearing-cloth
at more places then one. 2 Gulicke, lost lately by the States of the united
Provinces. 3 Dulken. 4 Newis, called by Tacitus, Nov^sium.

The country of Gulick^ o^ Iul^ers, of an Earldom, was by the Emperor Lewis
made a Ma^quisate, Munster.
Anno 1329: and about the year 1359, Marquess William for his good service
was made Duke of Gulicke by Charles the fourth. In the year 1496 it was united
to Cleue by a marriage between Mary Duchess of Gulicke, and John Duke of Cleue.

The Arms are O, a Lion B, armed G.

3 The Duchy of BERGE or Monte, was once the dwelling of the ^u^teri; Munster.
the compass of it is 130 miles. The chief towns are 1 Dusseld^rpe. 2
Hattingen. 3 Arusberg. It was made a Dukedom by Henricus called Auceps, first
Emperor of the Saxon line Anno 924: the first Duke was Eb^rhard. It was united
to Gulicke, by a marriage of the daughter of Berg, to Gerard, grandch^ld to
William first D. of Gulicke, about the year 1400: Thus we see these three
Dukedomes united together in themselue; first Berg to Guli^ke, Anno 1400; then
both these unto Cleue, Anno 1496. And now altogether joined unto the house of
Brandenbourg, Fr. hist*
Anno 1572. This Albert which married Maria Leonora. the eldest daughter of
Duke William, sister of Duke John, and heir of these Dutchies; had by her 3
daughters: whereof the eldest named Anne, was married unto Sigismond Electour
of Brade^bourg, and in her right Duke or Lord of these Countries. The rest
which pretend right hereunto, are Philip the Palatine of Newburge, who marrying
with the second sister of the Lady Anne, claims a part in the inheritance,
after the manner of G^rmany. 2ly Leopold, Lantgraue of Alsatia, brother to the
Emperor Ferdinand; who pleads an investiture granted unto him by the
Emperor Rodolphus; these Countries being imperial fees (feathers of the
Eagle, as he calls them) and so escheated for want of heirs males. 3ly
Johannes Georgius, Duke of Saxony; who claims from a compact made 1526,
between John the first Lord of these united countries, and John Frederick,
Duke of Saxony; which was, that D. John Frederick, marrying with Sybill, the
eldest daughter of Cleue: should when ever the heirs males failed, succed in
those estates: a contract which the succeeding Dukes cut off by the imperial
authority.

4. ALSATIA.
ELSAS or ALSATIA has on the West Lorreine, on the South Helvetia, on the East
the Rhene, and on the North tho Palatina^e. It received the Christian Faith by
the preaching of the aforesaid Maternus: The chief Towns are Strasburg,
formerly called Argentina, because in it the Roman Exchequer received the
tribute of conquered Nations. Here is a Clock of most admirable workmanship,
Maginus.
and a Tower 578 paces high; of this Town says a Poet, Vrbs praeclara si^u,
ripis contermina Rheni, Adrianus.

Maxima cui celsae me^i^ntur maenia turris.
Strasburg on Rhenes inamell'd banks does lie,
Whose lofty tower threatens the spangled sky.
2 Psaltburg. 3 Weisenberg, one of the ten Towns which Caesar like a politic
Conqueror, Munster.
built upon the Western bank of the Rhene, to defend the Roman Empire against
the fury of the Germans, and other barbarous Nations. The other nine were 1
Strasburg. 2 Selts. 3 Altrip in Latin Altaripa, because it is built on an high
bank of the river. 4 Saberne, or Elsas Saveren, whereas the Bishop of
Strasburg keeps his residence, being al Towns of this Province. 5 Bing. 6
Worms. 7 Boppart. 8 Confluence, and 9 Andernach. All these Towns, or at that
time rather garrisons, were under the command of the captain or Duke of Mentz,
to whom the defense of the frontiers was committed. As long as these places
were well garrisoned, the Empire continued impregnable on this side: But when
Constantine to make resistance against the Persians, transplanted these forces
into the East; the barbarous people entering at this gap, quickly defaced and
ruined the Empire. On the South end of Alsatia stand Colmar, Hagenaw, and
Schleistat, or Selestadium, three fair and ancient towns belonging to the
Empire.

This Country never had any peculiar Prince, but always acknowledged the
Emperor for their Lord: in the falling of whom, part was seized on by the Duke
of Wittenberg, part was alienated to the house of Austria, the rest remaining
imperial.

5. FRANCONIA.
FRANKELAND is bounded on the East with Boheme and Saxony, on the West with
Elsas, on the North with Hassia, on the South with Suevia, Bavaria, and
Helvetia. The old inhabitants were the Francones. They received the Christian
faith by the preaching of Boniface (or Winifrede) an Englishman, Anno 730. It
is at this day divided twixt the Palatine of Rhene, the Duke of Wittenberg, the
Marquess of Auspach and Baden, the Bishops of Mentz, Bamberg, Westberg, and
the Emperor. It once belonged totally to the Bishops of Westberg, unto whom it
was given by Charles the Great, Anno 772. Afterward Otho the Great invested
Conrade, Munster.
the husband of his daughter, with the Dukedom of Franconie. This Conrade
afterward Emperor, left it to his son Henry 3d, whose successor and son
Henry married Agnes his youngest child, to Frederick Barbarossa: and their
issue being extinct by the death of Conrade the fourth, Anno 1254; this Country
was divided between the Princes and Prelates aboue-named.

1 The PALATINATE of RHENE contains in length from Coub to Gomersheime, north
and South, 72 miles: and in breadth, from Sweibracken to Lauden, East and West,
96 miles. In this compass are some towns of the Empire, and not a few
Lordships belonging to the Bishops of Worms and Spires two imperial cities in
this Country, and both seated on the Rhine. Spires was formerly called Nemetes,
and is sufficiently famous for the imperial Chamber here continually kept, and
that the name of Protestants was first here given unto the Princes and
followers of the reformed Religion, 1529. Worms was of old called Vangionium
Speculum. In this town did Luther make his first appearance before the
Emperor Cha^les; from which when some of his friends dissuaded him, he made
answer, that he would go, were there as many diu^ls to confront him, as the
houses had tiles. In these two towns, Religion is indifferently allowed. The
rest of the Country follows the Doctrine of Calvin, as most agreeable to the
Scripture. It is the most pleasing and delicious part of all Germany, stored
with all fruits and metals; abounding with those cool wines, and growing on
the banks of Rhene, which are by us called Rhenish wines; adorned with many
gallant towns, if we consider either strength or bravery; and finally, watered
with the famous rivers of Rhene, and Neccar. On the banks of this latter,
stands Mospoch, Munster
a pretty neat town. 2 Heidelberge, the chief city belonging to this Prince.
It was once part of the Bishopric of Worms, from which it was taken by the
Palatines. It is now famous for being the seat of the Palsgraues; for the
sepulcher of Rodolphus Agricola; and for an University founded by the Emperor
and Palatine Rupertus Anno 1406. On the banks of the Rhene stand 1 Baccharach,
so called quasi Bacchiara, for the excellent wines. 2 Coub on the other side of
the water; nere unto which is the old and fair castle called Psalts, from
whence the name Psalts-graue or Palsgraue seems to have bin derived. 3
Oppenheim, a strong town, which together with Keisers Lauterne, and Ingetheim,
were given to the Palatine by Wenceslaus: and after settled on them by Rupertus
the Emperor and Palatine, for 100000 Florens, Anno 1402 4 Cruitznacke, called
anciently Stauronesus. 5 Frankendale, lately a Monastery only, but being
peopled by such of the Netherlands, M^reat.
which to avoid the fury of D' Alva, fled hither; is now a town of principal
strength. 6 Germersheim, and 7 Manheim, a well fortified town, seated on the
confluence of Rhene and Nescar. On the Eastern part of the country stands 1
Winheime a small town. 2 Lauden or Ladeburge, on the little river Tuberus,
bought by Rupertus aforesaid, of the Earls of Hohenloe, 1398. On the west side
are the towns of 1 Newstate. 2 Keisers Lauterne, or Caesarea Lutra. 3
Sweibrucken, the title of the younger house of the Palsgra^es, whom the Latin
Writers call Principes Gemini pontis, or Bipontani; the French, Princes of
Deuxponts, or Biponts. The particular names of all the other cities and chief
towns, I purposely omit; telling you only this, that here are in this country
14 other walled Towns, and 22 Palaces belonging to the Palatines: most of which
they have added to their Dominions, within little more then 400 years. Such
excellent managers of their own estate, have bin those worthy Princes of the
Rhene; so potent have they bin in ordering the affairs of the Empire, both in
war and peac^; and so exceedingly have they ingraffed themselves into the
most noble Families of Germany, that I may well say with Irenicus, Nen est
aelia Germaniae familia cui plus debeat nobilitas. The ancient inhabitants of
this tract were the Nemetes and Vangiones.

The Palatinate and Bavaria were once a kingdom, continuing from Aldigerius,
Anno 456, unto Tassilo, Anno 739: who was subdued by Charles the Great. Munster.
In his posterity they continued till the year 575, in which Otho the first
took them by force:: giving both Bavaria and the Palatinate, to his brother
Henry. His issue inioyed them till the year 1043, in which the Emperor Henry
the third, took them from Conrade the true heir to the great discontent of the
Princes of the Empire. At last they were again restored to Otho of Wittlebacke,
heir to the fore named Conrade, by Fre^ericke Barbarossa, Ao 1103* Since which
time, unto this present, the male line never failed. The chief augmentation of
this principate, came by the virtue of Frederick the Palatine, and the vice of
Wenceslaus the Emperor. The latter gave unto the Palatines for their voices in
his election, three strong towns of the Empire; viz: Keisars Lantern,
Ingelheime, and Openheim: and the former took in a battle, Anno 1452, the Duke
of Wittenberg the Marquess of Raden, the Bishop of Spires, and the Archbishop
of Metz, and ransomed them on what conditions he pleased. More particularly the
Earl of Wirtenberge (for it was not yet erected into a Dukedom) paid for his
ransom 100000 Florens, the Bishop of Metz redeemed himself for 450000 Florens.
The Bishop of Sp^res gave for his liberty, the towns of Rotenberg and Wersaw;
and the Marquess of Baden yielded up in lieu of his freedom, (...) County of
Spanheim, of which, Cruitznack is a part; the towns of Besiken and Binheim; the
right which he pretended to Eppingen, a town ouer-against Gemersheim; and his
royalties between this Gemersheim, and Selts, a town of Alsatia, in fishing and
hunting. From Otho of Witlebach, restored (as before is said) by Frederick
Barbarossa, there have bin in a continued succession 26 Princes Electours,
which have ruled in these parts 440 years, with great credit and applause. The
present Electour is Frederick the 5th, who in the year 1613, espoused
Elizabeth, daughter of JAMES K. of Great Britain, and Neice to Christian the
fifth, King of Denmark: which alliance, together with his manifold virtues, and
religious life, preferred him to the Kingdom of Bohemia, Anno 1619.

The Palsgraue has many prerogatives above the Electours of either sort: He
takes place of the Duke of Saxo^ie, and Marquess of Brandenburg, because
Henry the first Palatine, was descended of Charles the Great: Golden Bull.
for which cause he is also in the vacancie of the Empire, Governor of the
Western parts of Germany, in which office he has power to alienate or give
offices, to take fealty and homage of the subjects; and which is most, to sit
in the imperial Courts; and give judgment of the Emperor himself. And look
whatsoever shall in the vacancie of the Empire, be by the Palatines enacted,
that the new Emperors are bound by oath to confirm.

This Country is called the lower Palatinate, to distinguish it from the
Palatinate of Northgo^a (of which we shall speak when we come into Bavaria)
which belongs also to these Princes, and is vulgarly calls, the upper
Palatinate.

Grimston.
The revenues of this Prince, are 60000 pounds of yearly rents: less it cannot
be; the very silver Mines about one Town only, yielding every year 60000
Crowns; and the passage of one bridge over the Rhene, above 20000 Crowns
more: besides his Coronet lands, and other duties.

Bara.
His Arms are Diamond, a Lion Top^ce, armed and crowned Rubie. I say nothing of
the deplored estate of this Country, holding it more fit for my prayers, then
for my pen.

2. WIRTENBERG is about the bigness of Yorkshire; the ancient inhabitants
were the Tectosages, and Virthungi, from which last, the name of the whole
Country is derived; it having bin formerly called Virthunberg. The chief towns
are 1 Tubing an University. 2 Stutgard the D. seat. 3 Marbach. 4 Caustat: and
three Towns of the Empire, Esling, Wiler, and Rutling, all on the river Neccar.

Munster.
This Country was made an Earldom in the year 1300; in which state it
continued, till Earl Eberhard was by the Emperor Maximilian, made D. of
Wittenberg in the year 1495: in which time, his successors have added some
dominions in Elsas and Suevia; so that his revenues may equal them of the
Palatine. His Arms are Or, three attires of a stagge, borne palie barrie;
Sable.

3. ANSPACH, or Onalsbach is a town of Franconia, distant 5 Dutch, or 25
English miles from Nurenberge. The Marquess hereof is master of no small part
of Franconie: but his estate (as the other Germane Princes are) is mixed and
confused, with his neighbors. His chief towns then are 1 Anspach, or
Onolsbach, 2 Hailbrun, seated on the edge of Wirtenberge; it was walled Ao
1085; and in it were public schools erected by Marquess George Frederick,
Anno 1582. 3 Pleinfelt not far from Nurenberge. To this Prince also belongs
a great part of Voiteland, Irenicus.
where he possessed the towns of Culmbach; and 2 Hoffe (formerly called Curia
Pegniana) with diverse others.

These Marquesses are of the puissant family of Brandenburg, Reusner.
the first which inioyed this title, being M. Frederick, grandfather to M.
Albert, who in the days of Charles the 5th, so harassed this country. George
the first Marquess Brandenburg of Iagendorfe, was son unto this Frederick: so
also was Albert the first Duke of Prussia. The present Marq. Anspach, is
Ioachimus Ernestus, youngest brother to the last Electour Sigismund; and was by
the Princes of the Union, made General of their Forces, for the defense of the
Palatinate 1620; a charge in which he bare himself, either cowardly, or not
faithfully.

4. BADEN was made a Marquisate by Frederick Barbarossa. It lies between the
rivers Rhene and Neccar, Munster.
and is a fine pleasing and fruitful place. The first Marquess was Hermannus,
who took to wife Judith, Countess of Hochberg in Suevia; by which marriage,
many fair possessions accrewed to him in those parts. His successors also had
many fair Estates and Lordships in the Palatinate, which the Palatines of the
Rhene by little and little, have brought under their Dominion. His chief towns
are 1 Turlach, or Durlach. 2. Pfortshaimie; and 3 Baden, a proper neat town,
seated on the Rhene. Here the D. keeps in the winter, but at summer he
retireth to his fair castle of Milberg. Famous is this town for its hot bathes,
being no less then 300 in number; from hence the town seems to have took
denomination, in respect of which, our Bathes in Somersetshire, were called of
old, Caire Baden. They are profitable for many diseases, and exulcerate sores.

5. MENTZ is a Town, seated where the river Moenus, is emptied into the Rhene,
called in Latin Moguntia: the Bishop whereof is the chief Electour of
Germany; and in all places sits at the Emperors right hand: as his
spiritual* so his temporal lands are great, Munster.
but not comparable to his of Collen. Two of the Moguntine Bishops I cannot
omit, the one as infamous for his life, as the other was for his doctrine. The
first was Hatto or Hanno, who in a year of scarcity, gathered all the poor
people in the Country into an old barn, pretending a general alms: but
being there, he burnt them all, saying, they were the rats and mice which
devoured the corn: after this inhumane act, he was so haunted with rats and
mice, that to avoid them, he built him a palace in the midst of the Rhene,
whither also the rats and mice followed and devoured him. The second was
Boniface, who was the first that taught, that though the Pope neglected all
Christianity, yet ought no man to rebuke him for it. It seems that this
Boniface was a sound in Philosophy, as Religion; for happening to see a Tractate
written by Virgilius Bishop of Salizburge; of the Antipodes; and supposing that
under that strange name some damnable doctrine was contained; made complaint
first to the D. of Boh^mia, and next to Pope Zachary, Anno 745; By whom the
poor Bishop (unfortunate only in being learned in such a time of ignorance)
was condemned of heresy. The Archbishopric was translated from Worms hither,
by King Pepi^, father to Charles the Great. The chief towns here to belonging,
are 1 Lansteine, 2 Bing, seated on the Rhene: nigh unto this town is the
palace built by the aboue-named Hatto in the midst of the water; and is called
to this day, the Mouseturne.

5 BAMBERG is a reasonable fair City, and belongs to a Bishop of its own;
who possesses no small part of Franconie. It is seated on Moenus, not far
from We^rstberg. The reuenew of this Bishop cannot but be great: Sleid. Com.

Marquess Albert of Brandenbourg, for a cessation from arms, 20 Lordships;
besides the tutelage of his wards and Clients, his chief Town next unto
Bamberg, is Schestlits. and 3 Fochiam where it is said that Pontius Pilate was
borne.

Franconie; Munster.
which was by the guist of Charles the Great in the possession of his
predecessors* til Otho the Great gave it to his son in law, Conradus

so that he was feign to co^pound with him, for 220000 Crowns ready money, and
to discharge all his debts, which amounted unto 350000 Crowns more: by which
composition we may partly guess at the riches of his treasury, and partly at
the greatness of his intrado. The second Town of note, belonging to this
Bishopric, is Schwinfurt, seated on Moenus. 3 Arnsteme.

mentioned, Morison.
in the Palatinate, and Wittinberg besides many other: the chief whereof are 1
Norenberge, whereof the Marquesses of Brandenberg were once Burgraues; which
office was sold at length to the city by Frederick the 3d Anno 1414, or
thereabouts. His son Albert desired to recover the old office again, and
besieged the City; having on his part no less then 17 Princes on his side,
and yet could not force it. Sleid. Co^*
At this Town was held that assembly of the Catholic Princes of Germany; in
which a league was made against the confederacy of Smalcalde, Anno 1538. Into
this league entered Charles the Emperor, Fernando king of the Romans; the
Bishops of Mentz, and Salisburg; William and Lewis Dukes of Bavaria, Henry Duke
of Brunswicke, and George Duke of Saxony. Keckerman reports that at the
coming of Maximilian, the Emperor toward this Town; a wooden Eagle made by
an Artizan here dwelling, flew a quarter of a mile out of the town to meet the
Emperor: and being come to the place where he was, turned back again of her
own accord, and accompanied him home to his lodging. Sit sides penes autorem.

Frankefort on the river Moenus, famous for the election of the Emperors; and
for the two great book-marts here holden in mid-lent, and mid-September. It
took this name either from Francus the son of Marcomir, thought to be the
founder of it; or a Francorum vado, as being the usual foord or passage of the
Franks.

5 HELVETIA.
HELVETIA or Zwitzerland, is bounded on the East with Tirolis; on the West,
with France; on the North, with Lorreine and Elsas; on the South, with Italy.
It contains the 13 Cantons, of 1 Zurich, 2 Berne, 3 Lucerne, 4 Vraniae, 5
Glari^, 6 Zugh, Guillim.
7 Baset, 8 Friburg, 9 Vnderwalt, 10 Soloure, 11 Schaffhausen, 12 Apensol, and
13 Swits; from which last, the whole Country is called Switzerland. This is
reputed to be the highest country in all Europe, as sending forth sour rivers,
which run through all the quarters of the same: viz: Danubius thro^gh Germany,
Hungary, and Dacia East; 2 Rhene, through France and Belgia, North; Rhodanus
through France, West; and Pee, through Italy, South.

The chief Towns are Zurich, or Tigurum, nigh unto which Zwinglius was
slain, it being the custom of the place, for the Ministers to go in the
front of their Armies. Sleid. C^m.
And again he being a man of a bold courage, thought that if he should stay
at home, men would have deemed him to have fainted in time of war, which had
encouraged others in time of peace. He was aged at the time of his death 44
years, and was by the victorious enemy burned; his heart remaining in the
midst of the fire, after the rest of his body was consumed, whole and
untouched: (as was also the heart of Bishop Cranmer at his martyrdom in
England) 2 Sengall, or Ciuitas Sancti Galli, which rather is a Town confederate
with the Switzers, then any way subject unto them. The Anabaptists who began
in the year 1527 were in this Town very riefe; insomuch that one of them in
the presence of his father and mother, cut of his brothers head; and said
(according to the humor of that sect, who boast much of dreams, visio^s, and
enthusiasms) that God commanded him to do it. 3 Basel so called, either of a
Basiliske, slain at the building of the City; or of the German word Pasel,
signifying a path; or of (...), signifying kingly. It was built Anno 382, and
is famous for an University founded by Pius the 2d, Anno 1459. It was made a
Canton Anno 1501; and is honored with the Sepulchers of Oecolampadius,
Erasmus, Pontanus, Glarcanus, and Hottoman the famous Civilian. In this City,
Anno 1431, was held that notable Council, wherein though the papal authority
was then at the height; it was decreed, that a general Council was above the
Pope. What was then enacted, was immediately put in practice; the Council
deposing Pope Eugenius the 4th, and placing in his room Amadeus, Duke of
Savoy, who was afterward called Felix the 4th. 4 Constance, seated on the lake
Boden^ee, over against Lindaw, Sleid Com.
is within the confines of Switzerland; bu^ belongs to the house of Austria.
For this City being Ao 1548, outlawed by Charles the 5th, for not receiving
the Interim and not being able to withstand such forces as he had prepared
against them, put themselves into the protection of the Archdukes of Austria.
But herein they fell out of the fryingpanne into the fire: for Ferdinand King
of the Romans then Archduke, being possessed of the Town; ceazed on the
common treasury, and all the writings belonging to the Town; he commanded
that no Citizen should wear a sword, and that within eight days all the
Ministers of the Gospel should depart the City. Famous is this Town for the
Council here holden, Anno 1414, so renowned as well for the multitude of
people there assembled, as the importance of the matters there handled. The
people of note there assembled, were Sigismund the Emperor, 4 Patriarchs, 29
Cardinals, 346 Archbishops and Bishops, 564 Abbots and Doctors, 16000 secular
Princes and Noblemen, 450 common Harlots, 600 Barbers, and 320 Minstrells and
lesters. The business there handled was first the pacifying of a schism in
the Church, there being at that time three Antipopes, viz: Gregory the 12th,
resident at Rome; John the 23 resident at Bononia, and Bennet the 13th resident
in Spain; all which were by the Council deposed, and Martin the fifth made
sole Pope. The other maine business was the proceedings against Hierome of
Prage, and John Husse, both who (notwithstanding they had the Emperors safe
conduct) were unjustly condemned of heresy, Sleid. Com.
degraded, and then burned. Now the manner of degrading of Priests is this. The
party to be degraded is attired in his Priestly vestments, and holds in the
one hand a Chalice filled with wine mixed with water, and in the other a guilt
patent with a wafer (or singing cake.) Then kneeling down, the Bishops deputy
first takes from him all these things commanding him to say no more Masses for
the quick and the dead. 2ly, scraping with a piece of glass his fingers ends,
he inioyneth him never to hallow any thing: And 3ly, stripping him of his
Priestly vestments, he is clothed in a lay habit, and delivered into the power
of the secular magistrate. 5 Berne where, Anno 1528, Images were plucked out of
the Churches in a popular tumult; this being the first town that after the
reformation, was purged of those excellent instruments of idolatry. 6 Baden,
called for distinction sake the Upper Baden, is seated in the middle of the
Country; and is for that cause the place of meeting for the Council of estate
of all the confederates. It takes name from the Batches here being, two of
which only are public, the rest in private houses: conscious, as it is
thought, to much lasciviousness. For whereas it is said of Adrian, that
Lavacra pro sexibus separauit; here men and women promiscuously wash together,
and which is worst in private: whereas Munster tells us, Cernunt viri vxores
tractari, cernunt cum alienis loqui, and quidem solam cum solo; and yet are not
any disturbed with jealousy. These Bathes are much frequented, yet not so much
for health as pleasure. Their chiefest virtue is the quickening power they have
upon barren women. But as the Friars use to send men whose wives are
fruitless, in pilgrimage to S. Joyce the patroness of fruitfulness, and in
the mean time to lie with their wives: so it may be with good reason thought
that in a place of such liberty as this is* the lusty and young gallants that
haunt this place, produce greater operation on barren women, then the waters of
the Bath. 7 Lucerne, seated on the banks of a great lake, and so called from
Lucerna a Lantern, which was placed on the top of an high tower, for the
benefit of Sailors.

Zwitzerland in Caesar's time was so populous, that the Country not being able
to sustain the people, they set fire on their Towns and houses, and went all
with a general resolution to seek new dwellings. The men, women, and children
amounted to the number of 3680000: which notwithstanding were by Caesar
compelled to return into their pristine habitation. During the Empire of the
French, they were accounted French; Munster.
and Germane, when the Empire was devolved unto Germany. But being at last
ouer-burdened with the tyranny of their Governors; and seeing the Empire by
the Popes Fulminations, distracted into diverse factions; they contracted an
offensive and defensive league: into which first entered the Vranians, Swits,
and Vndervaldens, Ao 1316; neither were they all united into one consederation
till the year 1513. At their first beginning to free themselves from bondage,
Frederick Duke of Austria, sent his son Leopold to war upon them; but they
protesting that they never acknowledged the Dukes of Austria for their Lords,
but only such of this family as were Emperors; encountered and overthrew him,
more by the convenience of the narrow passages, through which his army was to
pass, Cominaus.
then their own valor. The first time that ever they got any reputation by
their valor, was in the wars which Charles Duke of Burgundy made against
them; when they discomfited in three set battles: a war begun on very small
occasions, and less hopes: the country being so barren, and the people so
poor, that their Ambassador to the Duke protested, that if all his countrymen
were taken, they would not be able to pay a ransom, to the value of the
spurs and bridle bits in his camp. Certainly at that time they were so
poor, that they knew not what riches was; for having won the first battle
at Granson, (the other two were those of Morat and Nancie) one of the goodliest
pauilions in the world, was by them torn into pieces, and turned into breeches
and sidecoats: diverse silver plates and dishes they sold for two souse apeece,
supposing them to be powter; and a great Diamond of the Dukes, which was the
goodliest Jewel in Christendom, was sold to a Priest for a guilder; and by
him again to some of the Lords of the country for three franks. After their
valor showed in those battles, Lewis 11th took them into pension, giving
them yearly 40000 Crowns, viz: 20000 to the cities, and 20000 to particular
persons. These pensions, when by their assistance Lewis 12th had conquered
Millaine, they desired to have enlarged, which when he denied, they withdrew
themselves from the amity of the French, and entered into the service of Pope
Iulio 2d; Guicciard.
who therefore styled them the Defenders of the Church, Anno 1510. Francis,
successor to this Lewis, considering what damage his Realm had sustained by
the revolt of these auxiliaries to his enemies, renewed the confederation with
them, on condition that he should restore the ancient pension of 40000 Crowns:
secondly, that he should pay unto them at certain terms, 600000 Crowns:
thirdly, that he should entertain 4000 of them in his pay continually:
fourthly that for the restoring of such places as they had taken from the
Duchy of Millaine, he should give unto the^ 300000 crowns: fifthly, that he
should give them three months pay beforehand: sixthly and lastly, that
Maximilian Sforce, whom they had estated in Millaine, and were now going to
dispossess; might by the King be created Duke of Nemours, endowed with 12000
frankes of yearly revenue, and married to a Lady of the blood royal. On these
conditions, as honorable to them, as burdensome to the King, was the league
renewed Anno 1522: since which time, they have obtained, that 600 of their
Country are to be of the French Kings guard; 500 of which, wait without at
the gates of the Court, the other hundred in the great hall.

As for the Religion of this people, they are divided into Papists and
Protestants; five Cantons being wholly Papists; viz: Swits, Grimston.
Urania, Vnderwald, Lucerne, and Zugh; Glaris and Apenzol mixed; and the rest
entirely Protestants. This division began Anno 1519, or thereabouts; when
Zuinglius minister at Zurich, or Tigu^um, sec^nded the beginning of Luther,
which innovation the rest of this people not liking, moved war with them of
Zurich, and the rest of the reformation; in which Zuinglius was slain, and the
Tigurines discomfited. But in the year 1531, an absolute peace was concluded
between them, so that notwithstanding this diversity of Religion, they live now
in a happy unity, governing after a Democraticall for me. The country is in
length 240, and in breadth 180 miles; and is thought to contain three millions
of people. In this Country arise the heads of Poe, Danow, Rhene, and Rhone, the
fountains of those two last, being not above three hours riding distant. The
people are very warlike, and since by reason of their situation, they have no
vent of men by traffic, they use to employ themselves on the service of any
who will hire them.

Boterus.
On the Southwest of Zwitzerland, lies Valesia or Wallis. It is seated totally
among the Alpis, Munster.
consisting indifferently of dangerous, rockie, and impassible hills; and rich,
pleasing, and delicious valleys; d^fficult to be entered, and that to but a few
places. It is in length from East to West, five days journey, but in breadth
nothing answerable. The names of all their chief Towns, you shall anon hear;
I commend chiefly unto your observation 1 Sedunum, Sittin, or Sion, the only
walled town of this country: of it self of no great beauty or worth, but in
respect of the other towns about it, neat and gallant. Built it is on a hill
of great height, and an ascent as hazardous; impossible to be mounted by force,
and unlikely to be taken by assault; the steepinesse of the rock keeping it
without the reach of gunneshot. 2 Martinacht, formerly called Octodurum, famous
only for its antiquity; and 3 Agaunum, or S. Maurice, the key of the whole
country; but chiefly in the wintertime. For then the ice does so shut up the
passages, that the only entrance is at this place, here being a bridge built
over the Rhene for that purpose, which is strongly built, and well manned, to
avoid surprisall. This town is the seat of the Governor of the lower Val^sia;
for it is divided into the upper and lower; in the upper are seven Cantons,
namely 1 Sedune. 2 Leuck. 3 Brig. 4 Nies. 5 Rauren. 6 Sider 7. Gombes. In the
lower Valesia are six commonalties. 1 Gundis. 2 Ardon. 3 Sallien. 4 Martinacht.
5 Intremont. 6 S. Maur^ce: all which are called by the name of the chief
towns. They were given by Charles the Great unto Theodul, Bishop of Sedune,
Anno 805, under whose successors they continue, but without much show of
subjection: The Bishop is chosen by the Canons of the Church of Sedune, and
certain Burgesses of the 7 upper Cantons. They speak partly the Dutch, partly
the French tongues. They combined themselves with the five Cantons of
Zw^tzerland, for the better maintenance of the Romish Religion, not above 52
years since.

6. SVEVIA.
SVEVIA is divided into the upper and lower. Mnnster*
The upper is bounded on the East with Tirolis, on the West with Helvetia, on
the North with lower Suevia, on the South with Millaine. The Country is half
in Germany, half in Italy: so that they use both languages. This Region was of
old called Rhaetia, from one Rhaetus, who flying out of Tuscanie from the fury
of the Gauls, planted here a new set of people, about 187 years before the
coming of CHRIST: whose Gospel they d^d receive about the year 448. They are
now called Grisons. The whole Region is divided into three confederations. 1
Lega Cadi Deo, whose chief City is Chur or Coyra, on which, as being the
Metropolis of the Grisons, I will the longer insist. It was built Anno 357,
seated about half an hours journey from the Rhene: for form it is
triangular, the houses indifferent hansome in themselves, but not uniform one
with the other. In one corner of it, on a hill somewhat higher then the rest of
the town, stands the close, within which is the Cathedral Church; a stately
piece of building, rather in the account of the natives, then strangers; the
Bishops palace, and the Canons houses, all well built, and sufficiently
adorned. This Town, together with all the rest of the Country in 2 manner, was
taken by the Spaniard, Anno 1622. This Liga Cadi Dio comprehends 21
corporations, and sends to the general Senates 23 Commissioners. The 2 is
Lega Grisa, whence all the people are called Grisons: It sends to the Senates
28 Deputies, and comprehends 19 Commonalties; the chief of which is Musocco.
The 3d is Lega Dritture, containing 10 Corporations, the chief Towns of which
are Bormio and Sondrio; and sends to the Senatehouse 14 Commissioners. The
government of this Country was given Anno 744, by Charles the great, to `the
Bishop of Coyra, who being molested by his neighbors of Tirolis, entered
confederation with the Switzers, 1471. They have free use of Religion, both
they of the Romish, as they of the Reformed Church.

Lower SVEVIA, or the country now called the Dukedom SCHWABEN; is limited on
the East with Bavaria, on the West with Danubius, on the North with Francoma,
and on the South with Tirolis and the Grisons. The chief Towns are 1 Vlme, so
called for the company of Elmes which inviron it. 2 Lind^we, seated over
against Constance, in the lake called Bod^azee: it bought her freedom of the
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa 1166. 3 Auspurg, called for distinction sake,
Augusta Vindelicorum, it stands on the river Leith. In this town Anno 1530.
Sleid. Com.
The Protestant Princes exhibited unto the Emperor, a confession of their
Faith; which is still called Confessio Augustana. Here also did the Emperor
compile the Interim, which comprehended a form of doctrine, which he would
have by all observed, till the next general Council: It was a miscellanie of
Religion, containing some things in favor of the Papists, and some of the
Protestants: yet neither party was pleased with it. 4 Norlingen. 5 Wherlingon,
towns of the Empire. 6 Ravensperge, an other imperial town. 7 Dinckelspuhel,
and 8 Gmund (both seated on the North of Danubius) of the same tenure also Here
is also the County of Hasperge, being the ancient patrimony of the house of
Austria, out of which came Rodolphus Haspurgensis, who sold Italy, and united
Austria to his small County.

The former inhabitants were the Rhaeti, and the Vindelici; these latter, if I
conjecture not amiss, deriuing their name from the river Lycus, which bounded
the East side of their country. They were both bitter enemies to the Romans, on
whom they executed all manner of cruelty, that a barbarous rage could invent.
To repress these insolences, Augustus sent against them his sonne-in-law
Drusus, being the father of Germanicus, who subdued them: but not without great
resistance: the women throwing their young children at the Romans, instead of
darts. The valiantest of the people were transplanted into other soiles, the
weaker remai^ed at home: who soon yielded the country to the Sueui, then weary
of the Romans neighborhood.

In the time of Caesar, these Suevi were the most potent nation of Germ^nie;
and brought against him into the field 430000 fighting men; whereof 80000 were
slain, and many of them drowned. They used to stay at home, and go abroad by
turns: they which staid at home, tilled the lands; they which went abroad,
brought with them the spoil of their neighbors. After they had slipped their
necks out of the Roman Collar, they erected a kingdom; which was ruinated by
King Pepin, and made a Province of the French Monarchy: from which again it
revolted, and was made an absolute Dukedom in the days of Charle^ the Gross.
This Dukedom yielded 6 Emperors, the last of which was Conradus, whose son
Corradine being the 21 Duke of this family, was slain in the wars of Naples.
After his death, the issue of the former Dukes failing, Rodolphus Haspergensis
seized on the greatest part of this Country, for Austria and the Empire: the
rest was shared, though not equally, between the Dukes of Bavaria, and
Wittenberg.

The Arms of Sueuia or Schwaben are Argent, 3 Leopards Sable.

7 BAVARIA.
Munster.
BAVARIA has on the East Austria, and Stiria; on the West the Leike; on the
North Bohemia, and part of Franconia; on the South Tir^lis and Carinthia. The
Christian faith was first preached in this Country, by Rupertus Bishop of
Worms Ao 612: the religion now is corrupted with the abuses of Popery, which
they will by no means be induced to ^orsake. The chief towns are 1 Munchen
upon the river Aser, the Dukes seat. 2 Ingol^^^^ on Danabius, an University. 3
Ratisbona, or Regensperg seated on the Donaw; Sleid. Com.
famous for the enterview here made between the Emperor Charles the fifth, and
Maurice Duke of Saxony: where it was agreed that Maurice abandoning his Uncle,
and cleaving to the Emperor, should be invested in the Dukedom and
Electourship of Saxony. 4 Passawe, where have bin so many meetings of the
German Princes; that especially, wherein all wars being ended between the
Protestant Princes, and the Emperor Charles, peace and liberty of conscience,
was restored to the whole Country. 5 Salisburge, by Ptolomie called Poedicum,
and of late Iuvan^a: it is seated on the river Saltz^ch, of which it takes
name. Here lies buried the famous Quacksaluer Paracelsus. This City is
honored with a Bishopticke, whose revenues are the greatest in Germany. Hist.
of the Coun. of Tr.
In the time of Luthers Reformation, Matheo Langi a Cardinal, was Bishop
hereof, who ingeniously confessed, that the Mass was not void of its faults;
that the Courts of Rome were corrupted; and that a general reformation of the
lives of Priests and Friars was necessary: but that a poor rascal Monk, (for
so he thought Luther) should begin all, that he deemed intolerable, and not to
be endured. 6 Frising, situate on the swelling of (...) hill, not far from
the river Mosacus: Munster.
it was called in former times Fraxinu^, and was erected into a Bishops See,
Anno 710. 7 Eystet, called in Latin Aishstadium, supposed to be built out of
the ruins of Aureatum, a town destroyed by the Hunnes. Finally the whole
number of cities in Bavaria are 34, Ortelius.
besides 46 great Towns: the soil about which is sufficiently fruitful in
all things, saving wines.

Bavaria followed the fortune of the Palatinate of Rhene, till the year 1294;
Munster.
in which Lewis the Palatine, and D. of Bavaria dying* gave to Rodolphus his
eldest son, the Palatinate; to Lewis or Lodowicke his younger (who was
afterward Emperor) Bavaria. This again ought to have bin united to the
Palatinate by the marriage of Rupert the Palatine, with Elizabeth heir of
George D. of Bavaria: But Maximilian the Emperor, gave the Dukedom to Albert
of Bavaria; son to Albert, son to John, which was brother to Frederick, the
father of D. George, Anno 1504. From Albert, descended Maximilian, that now
lives; who is the only temporal Prince of any note, which follow^th the
doctrine of the Romish Church; for which his house is so pestered with Friars
and Jesuits, that notwithstanding the greatness of his revenue, he is very
poor; as spending his whole state on these Popish flesh-^lies, by building for
them Colleges and Churches.

His Arms are Lozenges of 21 pieces in Bend, Arg. and Azure.

The Northern part of Bavaria, on the farther side of Danubius, is called by
some the Palatinate of Northgoia; by others the Palatinate of Bavaria; but
generally Over Psalts, or the upper Palatinate. It is bounded East and North
with Bohemia; West with that part of Franconie, which belongs to the city of
Nurenberge; and South with Danubius. It belongs totally to the Palatines of
the Rhene, and so has done ever since the year 1339: when Lodovicus the
Emperor, and and first Duke of Baniere, after the division aboue-mentioned
made between him and Rodolphus the Palatine; gave it for ever to the Palatines;
who it seems were not content with the former partage. The chief towns are
Amberg (the birthplace of the present Electour Frederick) whose silver mines
yield unto the Princes coffers, 60000 crowns yearly. 2 Newburg, which is
usually the Apennage of some of the younger Palatines. 3 Awerbach. 4 Sultzbach.
5 Weiden, and 6 Castle, where the Palatines of the Rhene, when they soiourne
in this country, use to keep court. On the North river of this Country, where
it jetteth toward Voitland, is the hill Feichtelberg, out of which arise 4
rivers, running four several ways: viz: Eger East, 2ly Moenus West; 3ly Sala
North; 4ly Nabus South: so that it may very probably be thought, that this is
the highest hill in all Germany. On the Southwest corner are two little rivers,
viz: Almul, which runs into Danubius, and Red^itz which runs into Moenus,
and so into the Rhene. Between these two river heads, which are but little
distant; Charles the Great, Anno 793, intended to have dug a channel; so to
have made a passage out of the Rhene, into Danow or Danubius. He employed in
this work many thousand men; but partly by excess of rain, and partly by I
know not what strange affrightments, they desisted. Some parts of the begun
ditch are yet to be seen, nigh unto Weisenberg, which stands between both
rivers. This Palatinate is in length from Weisenberg, to the hill Fe^chielberg,
68 miles: and in breadth from Hambu^ge, unto the edge of ^ohemia, 80 miles.

8 AUSTRIA.
The Archdukedome of AUSTRIA, comprehends the Provinces of Austria, Styria,
Carinthia, Tirolis, and Cara^ola; besides the parcels of Suevia, and Elsas.

Ortelius.
Austria is parted on the East from Hungary, by the Leitae; on the West (...)
Bav^ire, by the Ems; on the North from Moravia by the Tems; on the South from
Styria, by the Muer. It is called by the Germans, Ostenrich, signifying the
Eastern bound of the Empire. Munster.
The Christian Faith was first preached here by Saint Seuerine, Anno 464: at
this time they are divided in opinions; the greater sort, especially the
Nobility, addicted to the reformation. The soil of this Country is very rich,
abounding with all necessaries; and having great store of wines, with which
they supply the defects of Bavaria, and other neighboring Regions. The chief
Town, are Wien or Vienna, famous for a repulse given to the Turks, Ao 1526, of
whom 200000 under the conduct of Solomon the Magnificent, besieged the city:
but by the valor of Frederick the II Electour Pal^tine, and other Princes,
they were forced to retire, with the loss of 80000 Soldiers. This City was
made an University by the Emperor Frederick the 2d. It is seated on the
Danubius, and is doubtless one of the brauest and beautifullest Towns in
Germany: adorned with many magnificent Temples, and stately Monasteries; but
above all, with a most sumptuous and princely Palace, wherein the Archdukes
keep their residence, built by Ottocarus King of Bohemia, during the little
time that he was Duke here. This town was anciently called Fabiana, but being
ruined by the Hunnes, and again by the natives reedified, obtained this new
name. 2 Emps so called of the river Ems, on whose banks it is seated. 3 S.
Leopold. 4 Neustat. 5 Hainburg. 6 Crems.

Austria was formerly called Pannonia superior; and afterward being subjected
to the French Monarchy, was called Ostenrich or Austrich. It was wrested from
the Empire, during the reign of Arnulphus, by the Hunnes; from whom it was
recovered by Otho the first, with the aid of many Nobles, amongst whom the
Country was distributed; which Families being extinct, Otho the II gave the
Province to a young Gentleman called Lupoldus, with the title of Marquess, Anno
980. This Marquisate was by Frederick Barbarossa raised to a Dukedom, 1158,
Henry being the first Duke, whose brother Leopold, took Richard the first of
England, prisoner, in his return from Palestine: for whose ransom he had so
much money, that with it he bought Carniola, the Counties of Neobourgh, and
Luitz; and walled Vienna. His son Fredericus Leopoldus was for his manifold
deserts, made King of Austria, by the Emperor Frederick the second, Anno 1225.
Eleven years he continued in this dignity; at the end of which, he was spoiled
of his royal ornaments by the same Emperor, for patronage of villainous
actions in his kingdom, and scorning to appear to his answer at the summons
of the Emperor. Finally, he died in the year 1246, leaving two daughters. His
sister named Margaret was ^^r^ed unto Ottocar, son to Primist^^^ King of
Bohemia: his eldest daughter Gertru^e, to the Marquess o^ Baden: and Ag^es the
second, ma^ied unto Henry D. of (...)* Ottocar pretending the right of his
wife, took on him the Dukedom of Austria, which he kept after the death of
his wife, till the year 127^ (...) which he was vanquished and slain by
Rodolphus the Emperor* Rodolphus gave it to Albert his son; whose wi^e
Elizabeth was daughter to Membard Earl of T^r^lis, son of D. Henry of
C^rinthia and of Agres daughter of Frederick Leopold; Margaret the s^ster; and
Gert^ude the daughter of this Frederick dying issuelesse. By this marriage,
Albert had the Dukedom, of Austria, Stiria, and Carinthia; with the Earldom
of T^rcl^s and Carniola: This Dukedom was by Frederick the third, Emperor
and D. of Austria, raised to the dignity of an Archdukedome, as it still
continues.

two other stocks of the Imperall house of Austria, namely the Dukes of ^uspunc^
being the third* and the Archdukes of Austria being the second branch^ of which
last, Albert the Duke of Burgundy was chief. All which Princely Families, as
well for entertaining a perpetual unity among themselves, as thereby to be
able to mol^st their enemies; have made so many cross or inter-marriages, that
they ^aue remained still as brethren of the same parent, and as arms of the
same tree. In our time two of these Austrian Families are extinct* and the

2. ST^RIA or STIERMARKE is bounded with the Rab on the East. Carinthia on the
West, with Dravus on the South, and the Muer and Austria on the North: The
length of this country is 110 miles, the breadth 60 or thereabouts. The chief
cities are Marchpurg, and Gratz, whence the fourth branch of Austria is called
Du Gr^tz, and have the Government of this Country. Everewo^^.
This town was once full of Protestants, who could by no means be expelled, or
hindered from free exercise of Religion, till the year 1598; in which the late
Queen of Spain, Marg. Sister to the Archduke Ferdinand du Gratz, was by the
Citizens solemnly entertained; with whom entered so many Soldiers* that the
City was taken, and 14 Ministers of the Gospel presently banished. This
Marquisate of Stiria was united to Austria, by a marriage betwixt the daughter
and heir of Ottocar the Marquess, Morison.
and Leopold Duke of Austrian at which wedding, this Stiria by Frederick
Barb^rossa, was made a Dukedom. It was called in former times Val^ria.

3. CARINTHIA is 75 miles in length, and 55 in breadth; it (...) with Stiria on
the East, Tirol on the West, Ba^are on the (...), the Alps on the South. The
chief Towns are 1 Vi^^ach, 2 Spittall, 3 G^rah, 4 Freisach, and 5 S. Viti.
Santo. Vitus, or St Veit, the Metropolis of the whole Country. The ceremonies
with which the Archdukes of Austria are acknowledged Dukes of Carinthiae,
Munster.
are very strange and obserueable. For in the meadows adjoining to the town of
S. Veit, a certain country man to whom that office by inheritance belongs,
sits on a marble stone there being; holding in his right hand a cow with a
black calfe; and in his left hand a mare as lean as a rake. Then comes the
new Duke, attired in a plain rusti^k habit, his Courtiers attending him in
their richest apparel: at whose approach, the Country man aboue-mentioned,
demands; what he is that so maiestically comes th^t^erward; the people
answer, that it is the future Duk^. He again asks, whether he be a just
Judge, and one that will maintain the liberty of the Country, and sincerity
of the Religion; the people answer, he will. Then he asks, by what right he
will displace him from his mar^le seat; to whom the Steward of the new Dukes
house replieth, he shall give thee 60 pence in silver, the cattle now standing
by thee, the clothes which he has at this time on, and thy house shall ever
be free from tax and tribute. The fellow upon this takes the Duke by the
hand, and bidding him be a good Prince, gives him a gentle cuffe on the ear;
seateth him on the marble stone, and taking away the cattle, departs. This
done, the new Duke goes to S. Vites Church, and having done his devotions,
puts of his rustic weeds, and dresseth himself in clothes befitting a
Prince; for such after these ceremonies he is acknowledged.

4. CARNIOLA being 150 miles long, and 45 broad, is environed with Sclavonia
East, Italy West, Carinthia North, and Istria South. The chief Towns are 1
Newmarckt, 2 Es^^ng, 3 Marsperg, 4 Pegonocke, and 5 Saxenfelt, all upon the
Savus; which arising in this Country, runs through the very middle of it.

Ortelius.
5. TIROLIS is 72 miles broad, and as many long: It is bounded East with
Carinthia, West with the Grisons, North with Schwaben, South with Marca
Trevigiana. The soil of this Country is very good, and full of silver Mines,
which yield unto the Archdukes 20000 Crowns yearly. The chief ^owns are
Oenipons, or Inspurch (seated on the Inn or Oe^^s) which gave denomination to
the third branch of Austria, as being so called, descended from Ferdinand the
second, son of Ferdinand the Emperor; whereas the house of Grats proceed
from Charles being the 3d. In this town was Charles the fi^t, when he heard
how Mauritius, whom he had made Electour of Saxony, was coming against him
with his own men; which so terrified him, that he fled immediately into Italy,
and resigned his Empire to his brother Ferdinand. 2 Landecke 3 Tirol. 4 B^lzan.
5 Trent on the river Adesis, in which the Council was held by Pope Paul the
third. It began in the year 1545, against the doctrines of Luther and Calvin.
This Council continued, sometimes assembled, sometimes dissolved, for the
space of 18 years; and before the first meeting here, had at diverse other
places bin intimated and dashed; furthered by some, and hindered by others for
22 years together. The effects of this Council I cannot better describe, then
in the words of the history hereof, which are these: This Council desired and
procured by godly men, to re-vnite the Church, which began to be divided; has
so established the schism, and made the parties so obstinate, that the
dis^ords are irreconcilable: and being managed by Princes for reformation of
Ecclesiastical Discipline, has caused the greatest deformation that ever was
since Christianity did begin: and hoped for by the Bishops to regaine the
Episcopal authority, for the most part usurped by the Pope; ^ath made them
loose it altogether, bringing them into greater servitude; on the contrary
scared and avoided by the Sea of Rome, ^as a potent means to moderate the
exorbitant power thereof, mounted from small beginnings, by diverse degrees, to
an unlimited excess; it has so established and confirmed the same over that
part which remains subject unto it, that it never was so great no^ so soundly
rooted. So far the words of the History.

These Provinces belong all to the house of Austria: the revenue of which
Princes, would certainly be far greater; if the neighborhood of the Turk
did not put them to continual expenses, and loss of men and Money: howsoever,
I think they may yield them yearly, two millions of Crowns, and upwards.

The Arms of this Archduke are Gules; a fesse Argent; which Arms were assumed
by Marquess Leopold at the siege of Acon, because his whole armor being
covered over with blood, his belt only remained white: whereas his former Arms
were Azu^e, six Larkes Or; which Arms are supposed to have bin assumed by the
first Marquesses of Austria, because they possessed those six petit Provinces,
in which the tenth Legion called Ala^da, had in ancient times their station.

9 BOHEMIA.
Bara.
The Kingdom of BOHEMIA contains Bohemia, the Dukedom of Silesia, the
Marquisates of Lusatia, and Morauia.

Bohemia is environed with the Hercynian Forest, which the Romans could not in
long time penetrate. It has on the East Silesia, and Moravia; on the West
Franconia; on the North Misuia and Lusatia, Ortelius.
on the South Bavaria.

Ortelius.
The whole kingdom contains in circuit 550 miles, in which compass are
comprehended 780 Cities, walled towns, and Castles, and 32000 Villages; all
which are inhabited by a people given to drink and gluttony, and also to valor
and love of honor; this last quality belonging to the Nobles and better sort
of people; the former to the Commons: but in more moderate fashion then the
other Germans. All of them, rich and poor, noble and base, use the Sclavonian
language.

Mountaig.
The chief Bohemian Captain that ever I read of, was Zisca, who in 11 battles
fought in defense of the Hussites, against the Pope and his confoderats;
prevailed and went away victorious; insomuch that at his death he willed the
Bohemians to flea him, and make a Drum of his skin; persuading himself if
they so did, they could never be overcome: wherein he concei^ed so of
himself, as Scipio Africanus, and Vortimer king of the Britains did of their
selves: For the one having almost ruined the Commonwealth of Carthage,
commanded his body to be buried so, that his tomb might look toward Afric;
and the other having expulsed the Saxons out of Brittanie, desired to be
interred in the haven town of Stonar (in Tanet) the usual landing-place of
that people; thinking thereby to affright the Carthaginians from Italy, and the
Saxons from Britain. The Christian Religion was first preached in this
country by one Bosinous, Anno 900 or thereabouts; since which time they have
continued in it, though not without the admixture of one notable vanity. For
one Picardus coming out of the Low Countries, drew a great sort of men and
women unto him, Munster.
pretending to bring them to the same state of perfection, that Adam was in
before his fall; from whence they were called Picards and Adamites. They had no
respect unto marriage; yet could they not accompany any woman, until the man
coming to Adam, said unto him; Father Adam, I am enflamed toward this woman:
and Adam made answer, increase and multiply. They lived in an Island which
they called Parad^se, and went stark naked: but they continued not long: for
Zisca hearing of them, entered their fools Paradise, and put them all to the
sword, Ao 1416. Before this time also the works of Wickliffe were brought into
Bohemia, by a certain scholar who had been a student in the University of
Oxford, which happening into the hands of John Husse, and Hierome of Prague,
two men whereof the Country may worthily boast; wrought in their hearts a
desire to reform the Church: a business which they prosecuted so earnestly,
that being summoned to the council of Constance, they were there condemned for
heretics, and burned, Anno 1414. yet had their doctrine such deep root in the
Bohemians, that it could never by war or persecution be plucked up; but to
this day continues, though abundantly perfected by the writings of Luther,
Calvin, and other painful laborers in Gods Harvest.

The soil is exceeding fruitful, and enriched with mines of all sorts, Camden.
except of gold. Tin they have here in good plenty, the mines whereof were
first found out by a Cornishman, banished out of England, Anno 1240: which
discovery of Tin in these parts, was, as says my Author, in magnam iacturam
Richardi Comitis Cornubiae, (he means that Richard which was afterward King
of the Romans;) and no marvel, for in those times there was no Tin in all
Europe, but in England. Wood they have here good store, and in some of their
Forests a beast called Lo^^, which has hanging under it is neck a bladder full
of scalding water; with which when she is hunted, she so tortureth the dogs,
that she easily escapes them.

The principal rivers are 1 Albis, which here^ has his fountain, as also
has 2 Egar, 3 Mulda, and 4 Wattz; these three last al exonerating themselves
into the first; which runs through the midst of the Country.

The kingdom is not another, divided into Counties and Provinces; but into
the territories and possessions of several Lords. L^wknor.
The chief cities of the whole are 1 Prage, the Metropolis, seated in the
middle of the country, on the river Mulda or Multaw. It consists of four
several Towns, every of which has its peculiar Magistrates, laws, and
customs. The principal is called the old town, adorned with many goodly
edifices, a spacious market place, and a stately Senate house. The second is
called the new Town separated from the old by a ditch of great depth and
wideness. The third called the little town, is divided from the old town by
the river Mulda, and joined to it by a beautiful bridge, consisting of 24
arches; and in this town is the hill Rachine, on the sides whereof are many
fair and stately houses belonging to the nobility; and on the top thereof a
magnificent palace, wherein the Bohemian kings, and the latter Emperors, kept
their residence. The fourth Town is that of the Jews, who have here five
Synagogues, and live according to their own particular laws and liberties.
Near unto this Town was fought that memorable battle between the Duke of
Bavaria and Count Bucquoy, Leistenants for the Emperor Ferdinand, with 50000
men on the one side; and Frederick newly elected king of Bohemia, with the
Prince of Anhalt, the Count of Thurne, and 30000 men on the other side. It was
fought on the eight of November stylo nouo being Sunday; wherein (such was the
unsearchable will of God) the victory fell unto the Imperialls, the young
Princes of Anhal^, Turn and Saxon Weimar, with diverse others being taken
prisoners; the Bohemian ordinance al surprised; Prage forced to yield unto the
enemy; and King Frederick with his Queen compelled to fly into Silesia: a
most lamentable and unfortunate loss, not so this people only, but to the
whole cause of religion. The 2d City of note is Egra, situate on the river
Eger, on the very borders o^ this kingdom; where it confineth with Franconia,
and Vo^tland. It was once Imperial, but in the year 1315, it was sold by the
Emperor L^dovicus Bavarus, unto John King of Bohemia, for 400000 marks of
silver. 3 Budwi^s, a strong town toward Austria. 4 Melmucke on the river
Albis. 5 Weldawe. And 6 Pilsen, the last town of this Province, which yielded
unto the prevailing Imperialls; and then also betrayed unto Count T^lly, for a
sum of money by some of the Captains of Count Mansfield, who was then
absent, and had so long defended it.

The first inhabitants of this Country that we have notice of were the Bemi,
whom Pomponius Mela places in this tract, and calls Gens magna. To these in
process of time were added the Boij; Munster.
who being a people of Gallia Cisalpina, fled over the Alps to avoid the
bondage of the Romans, and seated themselves in Bavaria, by them called
Boiaria. Then entered they this region, and mixing themselves with the Bemi,
were jointly with them called Boibems, afterward Bothemi, and now Bohemi. They
continued a free nation til the coming in of the Croatians, and Sclavonians,
under the conduct of Zechius Ao 550, who with his brother Leches being banished
Croatia for a murder: Leches seated himself in Polonia, and Zechius in this
country, the people whereof in their own language, call themselves Czechians.
After the death of this Zechius, the state was of long time in a confused
Anarchy, even until the year 670: at what time not respecting the progeny of
Zechius, the founder of their Commonwealth; they fastened on Crocus a man of
good respect amongst them, B^rtholdus.
and elected him their Duke, Crocus vir iustus and magna apud Bohemos
opinionis, princeps electus est, says Bertholdus. Crocus being dead, the
Bohemians elected Libussa, the youngest of his three daughters: of whose female
government being soon weary, they elected Primistaus for their Duke, and made
him husband to Libussa. The rest of the Dukes being 18 in number, I willingly
paste over, and come to Vratista^s, whom for his manifold deserts. Henry the
4th Emperor of Germany, created the first king of Bohemia Anno 1086,

Berthold. and Dubrav.
The Kings and Dukes of Bohemia.
1086 1 Vratislaus the brother of Spitigneus the last Duke of Bohemia, was by
Henry the 4th at Mentz created king. 2 Conrade brother to Vratislaus,
notwithstanding that his brother had three sons, was elected Duke of Bohemia.
3 Brecislaus son to Vratislaus, the two sons of Conrade being rejected, is by
the Bohemians chosen. 1100 4 Borivorius, the 4th son of Brecislaus, is chosen
by the Bohemians, his elder brothers then all living. 1109 5 Sutopulcus cosen
german to Borivorius, by the consent and favor of the people deposed
Borivorius, and caused himself to be elected in his place. 6 Vladislaus II,
brother to Borivorius, preferred by the people to the throne before Otho the
brother, and Henry the son of Sutopul^us the last Prince. 7 Sobeslaus brother
to Vladislaus, promoted to the State before the son of Vladislaus. 1159 8
Vladislaus III, son to Vladislaus the 2d (the four sons of Sobeslaus
omitted) is chosen and crowned the 2d King, by Frederick the Emperor; but
deposed by the States: because he was not by them formally elected, according
to their privileges and customs. 9 Vldaricus, the 3d son of Sobeslaus, his
elder brethren yet living; was by the people elected in the room of
Vladislaus, and his son Frederick; whom the Emperor Frederick had by force
established in the throne. 10 Sobeslaus II, 2d son to Sobeslaus, was by
Frederick above named expelled; and he al^o by the Bohemians. 11 Conrade
grandchild to Otho the brother of Su^opulcus, elected by the Bohemians in place
of Frederick: between which two Princes there was continual war. 12
Wenceslaus uncle unto Conrade, and son of Otho aforesaid, was preferred
before many nearer the succession. Him Primislaus expelled, but fearing his
return quitted Prage. 13 Henry Bishop of Prage, a stranger to the blood, was
by a general consent elected Duke. 14 Vladislaus IV, brother to Primislaus,
the son of Wenceslaus, being put by; succeeded Henry: and soon after
resigned. 1199 15 Primislaus elected by the Bohemians, and by the Emperor
Philip crowned the third king of Bohemia at Mentz, was brother to Vladislaus
the 4th. 1248 16 Ottacarus, notwithstanding that Wenceslaus his elder brother,
had been crowned in his Fathers life time; was acknowledged King. He was
slain in battle by Rod^lphus the Emperor. 1278 17 Wenceslaus II, son to
Ottacarus. 1284 18 Wenceslaus III, son to Wenceslaus, the last of the
Bohemian Princes of the male line. 1304 19 Rodolfus, son to the Emperor
Albertus, is by the potencie of his Father, and the Election of the States,
seated in the throne; being otherwise a stranger to the blood royal of
Bohemia. 1305 20 Henry Duke of Carinthia, husband to Anne, the 2d daughter of
Wenceslaus the 2d, is chosen by the Bohemians: but being weary of his
government, they elect John of Luxenbourg. Finally, Henry was murdered by one of
his Nephews. 1311 21 John of Luxenbourg, son to Henry the seventh Emperor,
and husband to Elizabeth youngest daughter to Wenceslaus the 2d, is elected:
the Lady Anne yet living. 1346 22 Charles son to John, and Emperor of that
name the 4th; the author of the Golden Bull. 1362 22 Wenceslaus IV, Emperor
also, in whose time the troubles of the Hussites, and the valor of Zisca was
famous. 1418 23 Sigismund, brother to Wenceslaus, makes himself king by
force; and at his death commends Albertus D. of Austria, the husband of his
daughter Elizabeth, unto the Lords. 1437 24 Albertus Duke of Austria, elected
upon the commendations of King Sigismund, by the Bohemian Lords. 1440 25
Ladislaus, son to A^bert, who being the brother of two sisters, commended yet
one George Pogiebrachius unto the States, as fittest to succeed him. 1458 26
Georgius Pogi^brachius, neither by affinity or co^sanguinity of the blood: And
he though he had three sons; yet for the benefit of his Country, advised the
Nobles after his death, to elect the King of Poland. 1471 27 Ladislaus II, King
of Poland, and son to Elizabeth, the younger daughter of Albert Duke of
Austria; the issue of Anne the elder sister still living; elected King of
Bohemia. 1516 28 Ludovicus, son to Ladislaus, crowned and elected by the
means of his father then living. 1526 29 Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria,
brother to Charles the fifth, and husband to Anne sister to Lodovicus; by his
letters reuersall acknowledges that he was chosen King of Bohemia, not of any
right, but of mere free will, according to the liberties of that Kingdom.
1562 30 Maximilian, eldest son of Ferdinand, was in his Fathers life time,
and at his suit, elected king Ao 1549. 1575 31 Rodolfus Emperor of Germany,
and second son to Ferdinand of Austria; elected King. 1612 32 Mathias brother
to Rodolfus, was at the joint suit of them both, nominated and appointed King
of Bohemia, by the general consent of the States; during his brothers life
time, An^ viz: 1608, which denomination they both protest in their letters
reuersall, should not be to the prejudice of the liberties and ancient
customs of that Kingdom. 1618 32 Ferdinand II, Duke of Grats, was by Mathias
adopted for his son, and declared by virtue thereof successor to the Crown
of Bohemia, but never formally and legally elected: for which cause amongst
others he was by the States rejected; in like case as Vladislaus the third had
formerly been. 1619 33 Frederick Electour Palatine, the strongest German
Prince of the Calvinists, and most potent by his great alliances, was elected
King of Bohemia: and crowned at Pragu^, together with his wife on the 5th day
of November. This Prince is descended from the Lady Sophia, sister to Ladislaus
the 2d, King of Poland and Bohemia: and has to wife Elizabeth, daughter to
James King of Great Britain, and Anne of Danemarke, descended from the Lady
Anne, daughter of Albertus of Austria, and elder sister to Elizabeth wife to
Ladislaus the 2d above named.
It is recorded that in the quarrels between Frederick the second and Pope
Innoc^nt the fourth, the Emperor sent the Pope these verses. Roma diu
titubans, varijs erroribus acta
Corruet, and mundi desinet esse caput.
Fata volunt, stell^que docent, aviumque volatus,
Quod Fredericus ego malleus orbis ero.
Rome tossed with diverse errors down must fall*
And cease to be the mistress of this Ball.
For lo the fates decree, Stars, Birds, foretell;
That I a Frederick shall the wh^le world quell.
That which that Frederick then spoke in a hopeful desire of revenge, and a
vehemence of anger, had (I hope) some prophetical relation to the sacred person
of this Frederick: and that it may fall out accordingly, I beseech the God of
battles, and Lord of hosts, so to protect and comfort him in this time of his
trouble, that he may yet live to tread upon the neck of the Romish Adder, and
outsta^e the Antichristian Basiliske, till his enemies are made his footstool.

The revenues of this kingdom may amount to 3 millions of Crowns yearly,
considering that the following Countries are vnders its subjection.

Xiphilinus.
The former inhabitants of this Province, and Lusatia were the Quadi, against
whom, when M Antoninus the Emperor made war: he had unawares run himself
into such a straight, that his army was environed with mountains one way, and
enemies the other. To this (as calamities g^e seldom alone) was added the
extraordinary heat and drouth then being. To the Emperor thus put to his
plunges, came the Captain of his guard; telling him th^^ he had in his Army a
legion of Christians ( M^li^ens he calls them) which by prayer to their own
God could obtain any thing. The Emperor sends for them, desiring them to
make supplications for the Army; which they did^ and God Almighty that never
turns a deaf ear to the prayers of his servants, when they are either for
his glory, the Churches, or their own good; scattered and vanquished the Quadi
with thundershot and artillery from heaven; and refreshed the faint and dying
Romans, with many a gentle and pleasing show^e. This miracle purchased to that
Legion, the surname of (...), i. e. the thunderer; and induced the Emperor to
honor m^n ^f that holy profession, and to make an end of the 4th persecution.

10 BRANDENBOVRG.
Ortelius.
The Marquisate of BRANDENBOVRG is limited on the East with Poland, on the West
with Saxony, on the North with Pomerania, on the South with Lusatia: it is in
compass 520 miles, in which are contained 50 Cities, and 64 walled towns, the
chief of which are 1 Brandenbourg, built by Brando a Prince of the
Franconians, Anno 140. 2 Francofurt (for distinction sake named) ad Oderam,
which was made an University by Ioachim the Marquess 1506. It is situate in a
soil so plentifully stored with Corn and Wines, that it is not easy to
affirm whether Ceres or Bacchus be most enamoured of it. Magi^us.
Here is also at this Town a famous Empory, but not comparable to that of the
other Francfort on the Moenus. 3 Berlin, the ordinary residence of the
Marquess. It is situate on the river Spre, a river which arising in Lusatia,
emptieth it self into the Albis; 4 Hauelbourg, seated on the little river
Havell, the seat of a Bishop, who acknowledges the Archbishop of Maydenbourg
for his Metropolitan. This Marquisate is divided into the new and the old; the
river Odera watering the last; the Albis the first.

Brandenbourg was taken from the Frankes and Vandalls, by the Emperor Henry
the first, Munster.
Ann. 920: at which time also the Gospel was first here preached. This Henry
gave the Country of Brandenbourg with the title of Marquess, to one Earl
Albert: whose issue being extinct, Lodovic: Bavarus gave this Marquisate to his
son Ladowicke, Ann. 1314. His grandchild Otho, sold it unto Procopius
Marquess of Moravia, Ao 1373: whose issue failing, it was given to Frederick
the Burgraue of Neurenberge, Anno 1417, by the Emperor Sigismund. The
posterity of this Frederick to this day enjoy it, possessing also part of
Prussia; and the three Dukedomes of Cleus, Iuliers, and Berge, or Montz, the
Signiories of Prignits, and Crossen, the confines of Silesia, and this
Marquisate; together with the cou^tie of Rapin, and the Marquisates of
Iegendorfe, and Ansspach: so that they exceed the Dukes of Saxonis in
greatness of territory and multitude of subjects; but fall short of them in
the largeness of their revenew. This augmentation of their Dominions is of no
great standing; Prussia was estated on M. Albert, Anno 1525, and by a marriage
between Anne the Neice and heir of this Albert, and Sigismund the late
Electour, is newly added to the Electorall family. Reus^er.
Cleueland came unto them by the marriage last mentioned; Iagendorfe was given
as a requital of the services of M. George: and Auspach they wrested from the
female heirs of Wolframius the last Lord thereof: insomuch that now this is
the powerfuist family in all Germany.

The revenues of this Electour could not be less then 20000l by the year, if
he were permitted to enjoy his three Dutchies of Cleue, Gulicke, and Berge in
any peaceable manner. This house of Brandenbourg has among other good
Soldiers, yielded 3 of especial note, viz: Albert the last master of the Dutch
knights and first Duke of Prussia. 2 Albertus, called the Alcibiades of
Germany, who in the time of Charles the fifth (by whom he was proscribed) so
molested the Popish Princes of Franconia, as in some particulars I have already
showed: a man both in his actions, spirit, and valor, not much unlike the
present Count Mansfield. And 3ly, Johannes Georgius of Iagendorfe, brother to
the last Electour, who having fair possessions in Silesia, and furthering the
election of his Cosen the Palatine of Rhene, to the Crown of Bohemia: is
dispossessed of his estates, and proscribed by the now prevailing Emperor;
whom he cease not most courageously with all his force and policy
continually to disturb.

The Arms are Argian Eagle Gules membred and becked Or. Bara.
The people are of the reformed Church and follow the doctrine of Luther.

11 POMERANIA and MECLENBVRG.
POMERANIA is bounded on the East with the river Vistula, on the West with
Meclenbourg; Ortelius.
on the North with the Balticke Ocean; on the South with Brandenbourg. The
chief towns are S^e^in, Munster.
the Princes seat; once a poor fisher Town, now the Metropolis of the
Country, as rising by the fall of Wimeta, a famous Mart-towne in these parts. 2
Wolgast. 3 Wallin, or Iubinum, a Town which once flourished in traffic, and
gave place unto Constantinople only: the Russians, Daues, Saxons, Vandals, etc.
having here their particular streets. Anno 1170, it was sacked by Waldemarus,
King of Danemarke, since which time it never recovered its former glory, most
of her traffic being removed to Lubecke. 4 Gripswald made an University 1456.
5 Neutrepton a Sea Town. To this Province belong three Islands, viz: Rugia,
Wisedomia, and Volmia.

Pomeren, so called by the Sclavonians, for that it lies along upon the Sea,
was long time in the power of the Vandals; who being expelled; one Barvimus
took upon him the Principate, Ao 935* about one hundred years after which
Prince, Wartisl^us with all his people received the Christian faith, Anno 1130.
In their issue the Corone^ still remains, though now divided: for Anno 1540,
it was divided between Barvimus and Philip two brothers; the former having the
higher part next Prussia, the latter the lower part next unto Mecklenbourg.

MECKLENBOVRG, or Megalopolis, is on the West part of Pomeren. It was the seat
of the Heruli, and is a peculiar principality, the chief of her Towns being 1
Malchaw. 2 Sterneberg. 3 Wismar, so called from Wisimarus a King of the
Vandals, the father of Rhadaguse, who together with Alarick the Gothe, sacked
Rome. 4 Rostocke, made an University Anno 1415, at the entreaty of Albert and
Henry, Princes of this Province. The first Professors came hither from Erdfort
in Saxony.

This Province took the name of Mecklenbourg, or Megalopolis, from a great
Town of this name here being, when the Vandals and Heruli first settled here;
but now destroyed. Their first King is said to be one Anterius, the son of an
Amazonian Lady, a man which learned his first warrefare under Alexander the
great. The last of these Princes which took upon him the name of King, was
Pribislaus, who died, Anno 1179: his full title being, Pribislaus Dei gratia
Herulorum, Wagriorum, Cire^paenoram, Polamborum, Obotritarum, Kissmorum,
Vandalorumque Rex; These being the ancient names of those particular Tribes of
the Barbarians, which were by one general name called Heruli.

On the West of this Province, by the river Traue, is the fair Hanstown of
Lubecke; which of old was a Dukedom, but made subject by Frederick the first:
after whose death they chose another Duke, who within 5 years, together with
the town was taken by the Danes; and from them delivered by Frederick the 2d,
and by him infranchized. Not much above ten miles from Lubecke, is
Hamborough, in which Town are 777 Brewers, one Lawyer, one Phisician, and 40
Bakers. The reason why there is such an huge disproportion between the number
of Brewers, and that of Lawyers and Physicians; is, because a cup of nimis is
their best vomiting potion; and their differences are sooner decided over a
Can, then by course of law. Not far hence but on the other side of the river
is Stoade, where the English men have a house to sell abroad their clothes and
other commodities.

12 SAXONY.
SAXONY is bounded on the East with Lusatia and Brandenbourg; on the West with
Hassia; on the North with Brunswicke; on the South with Franconie and Bohemia.
It contains the countries of Thuringia, Misnia* Voitland, and Saxony.

1 TVRINGIA is environed with Hassia, Franconie, Misnia, and Saxony. The chief
City is Erdford, one of the fairest and biggest of Germany. 2 Iene, an
University of Phisicians. 3 Smalcald, famous for the league here made, Anno
1530, between all the Princes and Cities, which maintained the doctrine of
Christ, taught by Luther. Sleid. Com.
There entered first into this league the Duke of Saxon and his son, Ernest
and Francis Dukes of Luneburg; Philip the Lantgraue; George Marquess of
Brandenbourg; the Cities of Serasbourg, Nurenberg, Heilbrune, Ruteling, Vlmes,
Lindaw, Constance, Mening, and Campedune. Afterward, Anno 1535, there entered
into it, Bermine and Philip, Princes of Pomeren; Vlricke Duke of Wirtenberg;
Robert Prince of Bipont; William Earl of Nassaw; George and Ioachim Earls of
Anhalt; the Cities of Francford, Hamborough, Auspurge, Hannolder; and not long
after the Palsgraue, and the King of Danemarke. By this famous confederacy,
Lu^her not only kept his head on his shoulders; but the Gospel by him
reformed grew to that strength, that no force or policy could ever root it up.
4 Kale, or Hale, where Philip the Lantgraue was treacherously taken prisoner,
as you shall hear anon. 5 Weimar, a Town which together with the Castle of
Gothe, were assigned for the estate and maintenance of that religious, though
unfortunate, Prince, Io^n Frederick ^uke of Sax^nie, after his discomfiture
and imprisonment by Charles the fifth.

The whole country is in length but 120 miles, nor any more in breadth: yet it
contains 2000 villages, and 12 Earledomes.

This Country was once a Lantgrauesdome, but the male issue failing, it came
unto the Lords of M^snia, Anno 1211.

2 MISNIA is environed with Bohemia, Voitland, Thuring, and Saxony: Boterus.
it is watered with the rivers Sala, Plissena, El^ter, and Mulda. The chief
towns are Dresden, seated on Albis, having continually on her walls and
Bulwarks 150 Pieces of ordinance; a stable of the Dukes in which are 128
horses of service; and a Magazin, out of which 300000 Horse and Foot may be
armed at a days warning. The next is Lipsique, as famous a University for
Philosophers, as Iene is for Phisicians. It seems the Scholars and Citizens
will not suffer their beer to perish; of which here is so much drunk and
exported, that the very custom of it due unto the duke, amounts to 20000
pounds yearly; yet is this town of no more then two Churches. 3 Rochlus. 4
Mulberg, where John the Electour was discomfited.

Misnia was at first but a Lordship under Turingia, and was made a Marquisate,
a little after it obtained the Dominion of Turingia: Munste^.
in which state it continued, till the Emperor Sigismund gave the Dukedom of
Saxony to Marquess Fred^rick^, in the year 1413; whose posterity till this
day enjoy all the Dukedom.

3 VOYTLAND is a little country South of Misnia, whose chief Cities are
Olnits. 2 Werda. 3 Cronah. 4 Culmbach, and 5 Hoffe. This Country seems to
have taken its name from the Iuites or Vites, who together with the Saxons and
Angles conquered Britain: and to be called Voitland, quasi Vitel^nd* the
Country of the Vites. It belongs not totally to the Duke, of Saxony, for the
Marquesses of Auspach in Franconie, possess the greatest part of it.

4 SAXONY is on the North of Turinge and Misnia; her chief Town is
Parthenopolis now Meydenberg, or Magdeberg, which belonged to the Empire; but
now is under the patronage of the Dukes of Saxony. For when this Town refusing
to receive the Interim, was outlawd by the Emperor, and given to him that
could first take it; it was attempted by the Duke of Megelberg; but he was in a
Camisado taken prisoner, his Army routed, his Nobles made captive, and 260
horses brought into the City. Next it was besieged by Duke Maurice, who on
honorable terms was after a long siege received into it; Ao 1550, when it
had stood on its own guard the space of 3 years. This long opposition of one
Town, taught the Germane Princes what constancy could do; it held up the
coals of rebellion in Germany; and indeed proved to be the fire which burned
the Emperors trophies. For here Duke Maurice coming acquainted with Baron
Hedecke, hatched that confederacy, by which not long after this great Emperor
was driven out of Germany. 2 Worlits seated on the Albis. 3 Heldericke. 4
Wittenberg, the seat of the electours of Saxony, and an University of Divines,
founded by Duke Frederick, Anno 1508. It was called Wittenberg, as some
conjecture, from Witti^indus, once Lord of Saxony, when the extent thereof was
greatest. Famous is this town for the Sepulchers of Luther and Melancthon; but
chiefly for that here were the walls of Popery broken down, and the Gospel
of Christ reduced to perfection. The whole story in brief is this.

Luther was borne at Isleben in Sax. and studied first at Magdeburg; but at the
establishing of the University of Witte^berg, he was chosen to prosesse there.
It happened in the year 1516, that Pope Leo having need of money, sent about his
Iubiles and Pardons: against the abuses of which, Luther inueighed both
privately and publicly, by word and writing. This spark grew at last to so
great a coal, that it fired the Papal Monarchy; for the Germane Princes
cleaued to the doctrine of Luther, and protested they would defend it to the
death: hence were they first called Protestants. Yet was not this reformation
so easily established. Christ had foretold that fathers should be against their
sons, and brothers against brothers for his sake; neither do we ever find
in any story, that the true religion was induced or religion corrupted about to
be amended, without war and bloodshed. Charles the Emperor whetted on by the
Roman Bishops, had long borne a grudge against the reformation; but especially
against the confederacy of Smalc^ld. After long heart burnings on either side,
they brake out at last into open war, which at first succeeded luckily with
the Princes. But there being an equality of command, between John Frederick
the Electour, and Philip the Lantgraue; one sometimes not approving,
otherwhiles thwarting the others proiects: the end proved not answerable.
Besides the politic Emperor always eschewed all occasion of battle; and
by this delay wearied out this Army of the Princes; which without performing
any notable exploit, disbanded it self: Every man hastening home to defend his
own. The Duke of Saxony had most cause to hast^n homeward; for in his
absence, his cousin Maurice forgetting the education he had under him, and how
formerly the Duke had conquered for him, and estated him in the Province of
Misnia; combined himself with the Emperor, and invaded his Uncles Country. But
the Duke Electour, not only recovered his own, but subdued all the Estates in
which he had formerly placed his ungrateful and ambitious kinsman. The
Emperor all this while was not idle, but waited advantage to encounter the
Duke, which at last he found righ unto Mulberg, where the Duke was hearing a
Sermon. The Emperor gives the alarm: the Duke startled from his religious
exercise, seeks to order his men: but in vain. For they supposing the
Emperor to be nearer with all his Forces, then indeed he was; add the wings of
fear, to the feet of cowardice, and fly away; yet did the Duke with a few
resolute Gentlemen as well as they could, make head against the enemy; till
most of them were slain, and the Duke himself taken prisoner. The morrow after
this overthrow, he was condemned to loose his head, but pardoned he was at
last, on condition he should ransomlesse set free Marquess Albertus, renounce
his dignity of the Electourship; resign up al his inheritances, with the like
harsh Articles. It was also urged that he should alter his religion; but that
he so constantly denied that it was om^tted. For his after-maintenance, there
were rendered back unto him, the towns of Weymar and Gothe; from the former of
which, his posterity are now called, Dukes of Weymar. After this victory, the
Emperor fraudulently intrapped the Lantgraue; then marched he against the
cities, in all which he prevailed, restored the Mass, and drove them to hard
composit^on for their liberties. It was thought that in this war, the
Emperor got 1600000 Crowns, and 500 p^eces of Ordinance. The imprisonment of
the Lantgraue, contrary to the Emperors promise, was the chief thing which
overthrew his good fortune For Duke Maurice having pawned his word, and given
unto the Lantgraues children his bond, for the safe return of their Father,
found himself much wronged and grieved. Therefore consulting with Baron Hedeck,
he enters league with the French King, associateth himself with Marquess
Albert, suddenly surpriseth Auspurg, and by the terror which his haste brought
with it, forced the Emperor to fly from Inspruch, and the Fathers to break up
the Council of Trent. The Emperor now brought low, easily hearkened to an
honorable composition, which not long after was concluded; the Cities
recovering their privileges; free passage being given to the Gospel; and all
things being reduced to the same state they were in before the wars; the
restoring of John Frederick to his Dukedom and Electourship, only excepted.
So did this Duke Maurice both overthrow the liberty of his country, and restore
it; so was the preaching of the Gospel by his means depressed, by the same
again reviued, and established stronger then ever. Thus we see -- Vel nemo, vel
qui mihi vulnera fecit,
Solus Achillaeo tollere more potest. Ovid.

None but the man which did his Country wound,
Achilles-like could heal and make it sound.


I am no Prophet, yet by comparing causes present, with examples past, what
should hinder me from guessing, that as Johannes Georgius the D. now being, is
descended from his Maurice, and has to the prejudice of the Gospels free
passage, and his Countries liberty* sided with the Emperor Ferdinand in these
present wars: but that on a like insight of the easuing inconveniences, he
may with his ^ight hand build up, what his left has plu^ked down.

The Doctrine of Luther thus s^ttled in Germany, and being agreeable to the
word of God, was quickly propagated over all Christendom: the reasons of
which, next unto the Al^^ghty power of the most High, Sands r^l.
may be prin^^pally six. 1 The d^ligence and assiduity of preaching in C^tty
and Village. 2 The publishing of books of piety and Christian Religion. 3 The
translations of the Scriptures into the vulgar language; whereby the simple
might discern good from bad, the m^ddy doctrine of Rome, from the clear Water
of Life. 4 The education of youth, especially in Catechismes, which contained
the whole body of Christian Religion; which once well planted in their minds,
was it radicable. 5 The continual offers o^d sputations to the adverse party
in a public aud^ence; which being denied, gave assurance of the truth, and
soundnes of the one: as of the falsehood and weakness of the other. 6 Their
compiling of Martyrologies and Histories of the Church; which cannot but work
an admirable confirmation of faith and constancy in the hearers and readers:
There is one only policy wan^ing, namely the calling of a general Synod, to
compose the differences of the reformed Church, about the Sacraments and
Predestination; which would certainly strengthen their own cause; and weaken
the enemies; whose chief hopes are, that the present disagreements will arm
party against party, to their own destruction. But God grant that their hopes
may be frustrated, and we will say with the Poet, -- Hae manus Troiam origent?
Parvas habet spes Troia, si tales habet.
Senoc. Trag.
Shall these small jarres restore the ruined Pope?
Small hope he has, if this be all his hope.
Saxony was once far greater then now it is, containing all between Albis
and the Rhene ^ast and West; and from Danubius, to the Germane and Balticke
Ocean, North and South. The Saxons were a people of Asia. called the Saecae or
Sassones, who first seated themselves in the Cimbrick Chersonesse; Camden.
afterward they came more Southward into Germany. A valiant Nation
questionless^ they were; they conquered England, and were the l^st of the
German^s which yielded to the French Monarch, Charles the Great; by whose mea^s
also they recei^ed the faith of Christ Anno 785. The Prince of the Saxons then
was Wittikindus, from whom are descended the present Kings of France since Hugh
Capet, Munster.
the ancient Princes of Aniou and Maine, the present Kings of England, the
ancient Dukes of Burgundy, and present Dukes of Saxony. Anno 1106, Magnus
Duke of Saxony, dying without heirs males, the Dukedom was given unto Henry
surnamed Guelse, Duke of Bavaria, who claimed it in right of his wife Gertrude.
His son Henry, called the Lion, succeeded in both Dukedomes. But he being by
Frederick Barbarossa, for his many insolences, deprived of this dignity: it
was conferred on Bernard Earl of Anhalt, whose grandmother was He^like the
Mother of Magnus aboue-named. Ao 1423. The male line of this B^rnard failing,
Saxony was by Sigismund the Emperor, given unto Fred^ricke, Marquess of
Misnia. In his line it still continues, though not without a manifest breach,
which happened when John Frederick being deprived, D. Maurice was invested into
the Electorship. And because these translations of States are not ordinary, I
will briefly relate the ceremonies thereat used.

There were at Wittenb^rg scaffolds erected, on which sat the Emperor, Sleid,
Com.
and the Princes Electours in their Robes. On the backside of the Stage were
placed the Trumpetters; right against it stands D. Maurice, with two bands of
horsemen The first in a ^ull carreir ran their horses up to the pauillion:
Out of the second issued Henry Duke of Brunswicke, Wolfang Prince of B^pont;
and Albert D. of Bavier. These when they had in like manne^ coursed their
horses about, alighted, ascended to the Throne, and humbly required the
Emperor, that for the common go^d, he would advance D. Maurice to the
Electourship. He c^^sulting with the Electours, made answer to the Duke of
Mentz, that he was content, so D. Maurice would in person come and desire it.
Then came forth D. Maurice with the whole troup; before him were bor^e ten
ensigns, bea^ing the Arms of as many Regions wherein he desi^ed to be
invested. When he came before the throne, ^e kneeled down on his knees, and
humbly desired the Emperor to bestow o^ him the ^l^ctorship of Saxony, and all
the lands of John ^rederick late Electour. His petition was granted. Then the
Bishop of Menz ^^ad unto him the Oath by which the ^lectours are bound unto the
Empire: which Oath when D. Maurice had taken, the Empe^our delivered unto him a
sword, which was a sign of his perfect investiture. Duke Maurice now the
Electour of Saxony arose, gave the Emperor thanks, promised his fidelity,
ma^e obeisance, and took his place among the Electours. This solemnity was on
the 24 day of Febr. Anno 1548.

The revenue of this Dukedom in the days of Chris^i^nus, Augu^tus, and
Mauritius, was not les^e then 400000 pounds yearly; but now by the ill ordered
custom of Germany, they are distracted amongst diverse petty Princes and
Lords.

Within the bounds of Saxony are two small Principates, namely of Anha^t and
Mansfield; the P^inces of the former being Cal^inists, of the latter
Catholics; both which are Homagers to the Duke of ^axonie. Both these houses
have been long famous for the excellent spirits which they have bred up for
the wars, as if military valor were annex^d and hereditary to their
Families. The principal of them at this time is Christian Prince of Anhalt,
who so fai^h^ully stood out, as long as there was any hope of doing good, for
Fred^rick^ the El^ctour ^alatine, and King of B^hem^a, whose Lie^tenant ^e was.
And on the other side Earnestus Earl of Mansfie^d, so renowned for the wars
which he has maintained in all Germany, with great fortune and courage.
Camden.
They which delineate the pedigree of the Earls of this Family, derive them
(to note unto you so much by the way) from one of the Knights of King Arthurs
round Table, borne at Mansfield in Nottinghamsh^re, who settling himself in
Germany, gave name to this house.

Seldom.
The Arms of Saxony are Bar^^wise of 6 pieces Sable, and Or, a Bend slowred
Verte. This Bend was added to the coat, being before only Barry S, and O: by
Frederick Barbarossa, when he invested Bernard of Anhalt in the Dukedom. For
this Bernard desiring some difference added to his Arms, ^o distinguish him
from the former Dukes, the Emperor took a ch^plet of Rue, which he then wore on
his head, and threw it (...) his buckler or escotcheon of Arms; which was
thereon presently painted.

13 BRVNSWICK and LVNEBOVRG.
The Dukedomes of BRVNSWICK and LVNEB^VRG are bounded on the East with
Brande^bourg, on the West wit^ Wastphalen, on the North with Denmar^e, on the
South wit^ Saxony and Hassia The river Amasa or Ems runn^th throu^h the
country: whose chief cities are first Brunswicke, built by ^he Brunnus, son ^o
Ludolphus D. of Saxony, and Vn^^e to He^r^ the first Emperor, called the
Fowler. Nigh unto this Town is the mountain Hamelen, unto which the Pied
Piper led the children of Halberstade, where they all sunk, and were never
m^^e seen: but of this Story more annon when we come to T^a^^^lvania. 2 Woe
f^ha^ten, where the Duke does keep his Court; for though Brunswicke gives him
his title, yet will it not ye^ld him any obedience, but reputeth her self among
the Hans^townes: for which cause there have b^n great wars between the Dukes
and the Ci^izens. 3 Halbersta^e a Bishops See, the present Bishop (or rather
the administrator of the Bishopric) being Christian Duke of ^ru^swicke, that
noble young soldier, who has vowed his life and fortunes to the service of
^lizabe^h Q. of Bohemi^. 4 Luneb^urg so called of the Moon (...) the old
i^^^^itants did worship. 5 Cella the seat of the Duke of Lunebourg.

The Lords of these Provinces d^riue their pedigree from one Welfus, son to
Isenb^rdus Earl of Altorse in Sue^ia. This Isenbardus had to wife one
Ierm^nirudis* who grievously accused one of her neighbor women of adulteries,
and had her punished, because she had not long be^o^e bin deli^ered of six
children at a birth. It fortuned that she her self, her husband being abroad in
the fields, was delivered at one birth of twelve children, all males. She
s^aring the like infamous punishme^^, which by her instigation had bin
inflicted on the former woman; commanded the nurse to kill eleven of them. The
Nu^se going to execute the will of her mistrisse, was met by her Lord, then
returning homeward. He demanded what she carried in her lap, she answered,
puppies: he desired to see them, she denied him. The Lord on this growing
angry, opened her apron, and there sound eleven of his own sons, pretty sweet
babes, and of most promising countenances. The Earl examined the matter, found
out the truth; enjoined the old trot to be secret, and put the children to a
miller to nurse. Six years being passed over in silence, the Earl making a
solemn feast, invited most of his wives and his own friends. The young boys he
attireth all in the same fashion, and presents them to their mother: she
misdoubting the truth, confesses her fault, is by the Earl pardoned, and
acknowledges her children From Welfus the eldest of these brethren, descended
Earl Henry, son and heir to the Lady Luitgardis Queen of the Franks and
Bavarians. His posterity held Bavaria 109 years. Afterward they came to be
Dukes of Saxony, under whose command and Empire, Brunswick and Lunebourg once
were; Munster.
till Duke Henry called the Lion, was proscribed by the Emperor Frederick
Barbarossa, and disinherited both from Brunswicke and Saxony. At last his
grandchild Otho got by his submission, the Dukedom of Brunswicke, together
with the title of Lunebourg, by the grant of Frederick the second. This Otho
died 1252: whose posterity enjoyed these Dukedomes joyntlie, till the year
1430; in which the Country was divided between William the Victorious, who had
the title of Brunswicke: and his Uncle Bernard who had the title of Lunebourg.
In their posterity both these Dukedomes still remain, though Brunswicke be the
greater.

14. HASSIA.
The Lantgrauedome of HASSIA is environed on the East with Saxony, on the
South with Franconie, on the West and North with Westphalen. It took its name
from the Hassi, who with the Chatti inhabited the Country. Camd. R^.
The Christian Faith was first here preached by Boniface or Winifride an
Englishman, Ao 730, or thereabouts: of which Winifride I find this pretty
Apothegme, that in old time there were golden Prelates, and wood^n chalices;
but in his time, wooden Prelates, and golden ch^l^ces. Not much unlike this
there is another of newer inventi^n, viz: that Christians had once blind
Churches, and lightsome hearts; but now they have lightsome Churches, and blind
hearts.

The chief towns are 1 Dormestad, the seat and inheritance of the youngest
House of the La^tgraues. This Lodowicke was by Count Mansfield taken prisoner,
Anno 1622, and his whole town and Country exposed to the spoil and rapine of
his soldiers: because (besides other ill offices) he was the chief perswader
of the Princes of the union, to disband their forces provided for the defense
of the Palatinate; and reconcile themselves to the Emperor. Morison.

5th, whom he so valiantly withstood. 3 Geysen a town belonging to the
Lantgraues of Marpurge. 4. Dries. 5 Frankenbourge; 6 Cassels, three towns
belonging to the elder house of the Lantgraues, whereof Cassell is the chief,
as being the seat of their residence. This city is situate in a fruitful
Country, and is well fortified with strong earthen walls, and deep ditches: yet
are the houses of no great beau^y; being composed for the most part, of wood,
thatch, and clay. Unto this Province belongs the County of Waldecke, whose
chief Cities are 1 Wa^decke; and Corbach: the Earls hereof are subject to the
Lantgraue; the first of them being Otho, Re^sner.
Ao 1300 or thereabouts.

Within this Country also is the country of Vetera^ia, commonly called the
Conf^deration of Wederawe; containing among others, the Counties of Nassaw, and
Hanawe, and the free City of Frieburge. This Frieburge is (as we said) an
imperial City, situate in the midst of most pleasant and delicious
corne-fields. Hanaw, or Hannouia, is distant from Francfort ad Moenum ten
miles, and is a County of it self; the chief town next unto it, being
Windecke; the first Earl hereof was in the year 1392, or thereabouts, and by
name Otho. As for the County of Nassaw, it has in it many Pri^^^ towns, as 1
Dillingbourg the principal. 2 Nassaw. 3 Catzenelbagen an Earldom of it
self: to which both the Princes of Orange, and Lantgraues of Hassen lay title;
and in whose name some footsteps of the Chatti are apparently couched; and 4
Herborn, in which that great Scholle^ Piscator professed Divinity; and that
huge method-monger Alstedius, now teaches the Arts. This house of Nass^w is
very ancient and famous, R^usuer.
the first Earl being one Otho, Ao 1079: out of whose loins have streamed
Adolphus Nassovius the Emperor, Ao 1292, the ancient Dukes of Geldria and the
present Princes of Orange, who are Lords also of many towns and Seigneuries
in Belgia. All these Princes, as also the Lantgraue follow the doctrine of
Calvin.

Hassia was once an Earldom under Thuringia, Anno 1042, Lodowicke was Earl
of Hassen, whose successors were afterward preferred to the dignity of
Lantgraues; the most puissant of which was Philip, a man who much swayed the
affairs of Germany. Sl^id. Com.
Anno 1520. he discomfited King Fernando, and restored Vlricke to the Dukedom
of Wirtenberge. Anno 1530, he united all the Protestant Princes and cities of
Germany, in a common league at Smalcald, for the defense of the reformed
religion, Ano 1545, he undertook the cause of Gos^aria against the D. of
Brunswicke, whom in a set battle he took prisoner, together with his son,
and possessed his Country. Anno 1548, he united all the Princes and Cities of
Germany, in an offensive and a defensive league against Charles the fifth. But
that war succeeded not prosperously; for (...) and the Duke of Saxony his
perpetual confederate, being taken prisoners; he submitted himself to the
Emperor at Kale or Hale in Misnia, his sons in Law D. Maurice, the Marquess
of Brandenbourg; and Wolfang Prince of Deuxponts, having given their bonds for
his return. The conditions of his pardon were 1, that he should dismantle all
his towns, except Cassell: 2. that he should yield up unto the Emperor, all
his munition: 3 that he should pay unto the Emperor 150000 Crowns. The same
night he was by the D. of Alva invited to supper: his sons in law of Saxony
and Brandenbourg accompanying him. After supper he was contrary to the Laws o^
hospitality, and the Emperors exact promise, detained prisoner: R. Ascham.
The fallacy stood thus. In the Emperors compact with the three Princes, the
words were, that the Lantgraue should be kept, Nicht in emig gesengknes, that
is, not in any prison; which the Emperors Secretary by a small dash of his
pen, turned into Nicht in ewig gefengk^es, that is, not in everlasting
prison. Well, in prison he staide 5 years, which being expired, he was again
set at large by Duke Maurice, the ouerthrower and restorer of the German
liberty.

The Arms of the Lantgraue are Azure, Paradin.
a Lion barri^ of 8 pieces, Arg. and Gules; armed and crowned Or.

There are diverse other inferior Princes of Germany, which yet are absolute
and free: insomuch that in one days riding, a Traveler may meet with diverse
lands, Morison.
and diverse coins twice or thrice: every free Prince and free City (whose
Laws the Emperors are sworn to keep inviolable) having power to make what
Laws, and coin what money he will. And hence in the censure of kingdoms; the
King of Spain is said to be Rex hominum^, because of his subjects reasonable
obedience: the king of France, Rex Asmorum, because of their infinite taxes and
impositions: the King of England, Rex Diabolorum, because of his subjects often
insurrections against, and depositions of their Princes: But the Emperor of
Germany is called Rex R^gum, because there is such a number of Reguli, or free
Princes which live under his command; or rather at their own command; for they
do even what they list.

OF DENMARK.
DENMARK contains the Cimbricke Chersonesse, part of Scandia, and the Islands
of the Balticke Sea.

Ortelius.
The CHERSONESSE has on the Southwest the Albis, on the Southeast the river
Trare, on the South a little piece of Germany. In all other parts, the sea. It
was first inhabited by the Cimbri, thence called the Cimbrian Chersonesse. Of
the Cimbri we shall speak more anon; Stephanus.
as for Chersonesus it is so called (...), a terra and insula. It being the
same with Peninsula in Latin. Now of these Chersonesi, five were most famous,
1 Peloponnesus in Greece; 2ly Thracica Chersonesus in Thrace: 3ly Taurica
Chersonesus in Scythia or Tartary; 4ly Aurea Ch^rsonesus in India; of all which
in their due places; and 5ly this Cimbrica Chersonesus where we now are. This
Cimbrian Chersonesse is then in length 120 miles, in breadth 80: and contains
28 Cities, 4 Bishops Sees, and 20 royal castles or palaces; as well for the
Country, as the private retirements of the King. The chief Provinces are Holst
or Holsatia, whose chief Cities are Nyemunster and Bramsted: Maginus.
this Province is the title of the second son of Denmark. II Dietmars, whose
chief Cities are Meldorp, whose citizens are so rich, that they cover their
houses with copper: and 2 Marue. III Slesia, or Sleswicke, whose chief towns
are Goterpe, and 2 Londen an haven Town upon Eider. IV. Iuitland whence came
the Iuites, who together with the Saxons, and Angles, conquered England. The
chief tow^s are 1 Rincopen, 2 Nicopen* 3 Holn, and 4 Arhausen.

The ISLANDS of the BALTICKE are 35. The chief are Senland or Selandunia, in
length 64, in breadth 52 miles. It contains 7 strong castles belonging to the
King, and about 13 Cities, the chief of which are 1 Haffen, or Hafnia, the
kings seat, and the only University in Denmark; it is called by the Germans,
Copenhagen: that is, m^rcatorum portus, the merchants H^uen. 2 Helfinura, or
Elseneur, standing on the Sea side. At this town the Mariners which have
passed, or are to pass the Sound, use to pay their customs. 3 Rosc^^lt, the
Sepulcher of the Danish Princes; Between this Hand and the firm land of
Scundivania, is the passage called the Sound, toward Muscovie: which did yield
unto the King very great profit yearly; but now it is not a little fallen,
since the Eng^ish found out the Northern passage unto Russia. This Sound is in
breadth 3 miles and somwh^t more; and is commanded by the castle of Hilsembourg
on Scandia side, and that of Cronburge in this Island: which castles are the
best forti^ied and furnished of any in this Country. II ^ionia or Fuinen
containing 8 cities; the principal whereof are 1 Ottonium or Osel. 2
Swienbourgh or Suiborch. III Bornholmia, situate on the Balticke sea, not far
from Gothland; the chief city is Borneholme. It was redeemed by Frederick the
2d, from the state of Lubecke; to which it had for 50 years together bin
pawned. IV Fimera, in which Ticho Brahe built an artificial Tower; in which
are many rare Mathematical Instruments. The chief town is Petersborne.

SCANDIVANIA or SCANDIA, is environed with the Seas, save where it is joined to
Muscovie. It lies part on this side* part beyond the Articke circle; so that
the longest day in the more Northern part is about three Months. It contains
the Kingdoms of Norwey, Swethland, and part of Denmark. That part of
Scandivania which belongs unto Denmark, is situate in the South of this
great Peninsula; and is divided into 3 Provinces, viz: 1 Hallandia, 2 Sconia or
Scania; and 3 Blescida.

Ha^india has on the North Swethland, on the South Scandia, on the East the
wild woods that part it from Gothland. The Country is fruitfuller then
Blescida, and barrenner then Scania. The chief town is Halanesoe.

Scania or Seonia has on the South Hallandia; on all other parts the sea. It
is in length 72 miles, and 48 in breadth; and is the pleasantest Country in all
Denmark, most abundant in fruits, most rich in merchandise, and on the sea
sides so stored with herr^ngs; that sometimes ships are scarce able with wind
and oar to break through them, and row off the harbor. The chief towns are 1
Londis, a great haven town. 2 Elbogen. 3 Falskerbode. Here is also the castle
of Elsimbourg aboue-mentioned.

Bl^scida or Blicker has on the North Swethland, on the Fast and South the
Balticke sea; on the North a little Si^us or sea gullet, by which it is parted
from Scanta. It is a mountainous and barren country. The chief towns are
Ma^nogia, the birth place of Casp. Bertholinus; and 2 Colmar, a strong
fortress against the Sw^thlander.

The people of this Country are good Soldiers both by sea and land; Ious.
Boter:
but fitter for the sea then the field: the Magistrate is wise rather by
experience, then by study; the old man covetous; the young man thrifty; and the
Merchant ambitious. The women are of the same conditions as the women of
^elgia. They received the Christian Religion by the preaching of Ansu^rius,
Munster.
and follow the reformation of Luther.

The soil is naturally more fit for pasture, then for tillage; feeding such a
multitude of Oxen, that 50000 are said to be sent hence yearly into Germany.
Their other commodities, are Fish, Tallow, Furniture for shipping, Armours,
Oxe-hides, Buck skins, Wamscot, Firrewood, Filberds, and the like.

The first inhabitants hereof were the Cimbri, a people descended from Gomer,
the first son of Iaphet. They are said to have first dwelt on the banks of
Palus Moeotis, Plutarch.
where they were called Cimmerij, and gave name to Bospherus Cimmerius there
being. These C^mmerij being ouer-layed by the Scythians, removed their seats
more Northward into a Country bounded according to Plutarch by the great Ocean
on the one side; and the Forest of Heroynia on the other; being the Country
where we now are. They were a people of extraordinary big stature, h^uing blew
or red eyes, and lived most upon theft; so that for their sakes, (...), the
Germans called all thieves, Cimbres. It happened that the Ocean ouerflowing a
great part of their Country compelled them to seek new seats; whereupon in
great multitudes abandoning their dwellings, they petitioned the Romans, then
lording it over a great part of the world, for some place to settle in. This
request being denied, they proceeded in an other manner, winning with their
swords, what their tongues could not obtain. Manilius, Sillanus, and Cepio, all
Roman Consuls, perished by them; so that now (says Florus) actum esset de
imperio Romano, nisi illi seculo Marius contigisset; for he, as we have
elsewhere told you, utterly overthrew them. The next inhabiters hereof were the
Saxons, of whom we have already spoken; and as for the Danes they were a people
inhabiting the Islands of Sinus Codanus, who about the year 500, Camden.
left their old dwellings, and came unto the Cimb^icke Chersonesse; not long
before forsaken by the Saxons, at the conquest of England. They lived a great
while in a confused state, which at last was brought to some conformity by
Gotricus their King, Munster.
Anno 797: They were much given to Sea-robberies, and taking dislike against
Osbert King of Northumberland, who had ravished a Lady, sister to the Danish
King; they came with great strength into England: where for 255 years they
tyrannized over the afflicted people. Of late they have had no wars but with
the Swethlanders, to whose kingdom they pretend a title from their Q.
Margaret; who vanquished Albertus the King of Swethland, and governed it: as
also did many of her successors, as shall be showed in the Catalogue of the
Swethland Kings. I will now reckon up such Kings of the Danes, as have bin
since Charles the Great, the former of which were in number 44, having no
certainty or appearance of continuance.

Boterus.
The revenues of this Crown cannot be great; there being no commodity in his
kingdom but fish, to allure Mariners: they which are also, are uncertain,
considering the Sound sometimes yields more then others.

Bara.
The Arms are Or, 3 Lions passant Vert, crowned of the first.

OF NORWAY.
Maginus.
NORWEY is bounded on the North with Lappia, on the East with the Dofrine
mountains, by which it is parted from Swethland; on the other parts with the
Seas. It contains in length 1300 miles, in breadth not half so much. This
country is exceedingly troubled with certain little beasts, Munster.
which they call Lemmers. They are about the bigness of a field mouse, and are
by the inhabitants said to drop out of the clouds in tempestuous weather. They
devour like the Locusts every green thing on the earth, and at a certain time
die all in heaps (as it were) together: and with their stench so poison the
air, that the poor people are long after troubled with the Iaundies, and with
a giddiness in the head. But these beasts come not often.

It is called Norwey for the Northern situation: the people are much given to
hospitality, plain-dealers, etc abhorring theft They were once famous warriers,
they conquered Neustria in France, since called Normandy, under the conduct of
Rollo; England under the leading of D. William; Italy and Sicily under the
banners of Tancred: Ireland and the Orcades under the ensigns of Turgesius:
and the kingdom of Antioch under the leading of Boemund.

The soil is so barren, that the people live on dried fish inst^ed of bread;
but the better (that is the richer sort) buy corn of such merchants as come to
traffic with the^. Their chief commodities are stockfish, butter, rich furs,
train oil, pitch, and tackling for ships; as masts, cables, deale-boards, and
the like; which the inhabitants exchange for corn, wine, fruits, and beer.

Towns here are exceeding thin, and in them the houses very miserable and
poor; for the most part patched up of dirt and hurdles, not much unlike our
ordinary village-houses in Lincolneshire, The chief of these towns are 1
Nidrosia, the Sea of an Archbishop, who is the Metropolitan of Norwey, Island,
and Groinland. 2 Bergen, one of the four ancient mart-townes of Europe; the
other three being London in England, Novigrod in Muscovie, and Bruges in
Flanders. But of these, three are decayed, viz: this Bergen, which has yielded
to Wardhuis; Novigrod which by reason of the change of navigation through the
Balticke, into the Northern passage, has given way to S. Nicholas: and Bruges
which was deprived of her traffic by Antwerpe, from whence it is removed to
Amsterdam: For the Hollanders by blocking up the haven; but especially by
keeping Bergen aep Zome, have such a command over the river; that no vessel
can pass or repasse without their license. 3 Asloya, a Bishops See, and the
place in which Justice is administered for all the kingdom: and 4 Staffanger.

On the North and West of Norwey lies Finmarchia, Market.
a great and populous Province; the people whereof are for the most part
idolaters. It took the name of Finmarch, as being the bounds or marches of the
F^nni, of which people we shall tell you more in Swethland; it is subject
together with Norwey unto the king of Denmark. The chief towns are 1 Saman, 2
Hielso, both sea-townes: and 3 Wardhuis seated in the very Northern end of all
the Country; a town very profitable and serviceable to the King, in that it a
weth the Lappians, who border on this Province: and because ships must of
necessity touch at it in their passage to Muscouie. It is so called, for that
it stands in a little Island called Ward.

Munster.
To omit the Catalogue of such Kings as are uncertain, we will begin with king
Subidagerus, who was king of all the three kingdoms, and at his death divided
them again amongst his three sons.

The Kings of Norwey.
1 Subidagerus 2 Haddingus 3 Hotharius 4 Collerus 5 F^ogerus 6 Gota^us 7
Rotherus 8 Helga 9 Hasmunlu^ 10 Reginaldus 11 Gumaraus 12 Osmundus 13 Olaus 14
Osmundus II. not long after whose time Anno. sc. 800, the Normans began their
irruptions. 15 Aquinus 16 Heraldus 17 Olaus II 18 Sueno K. of Dan. 19 Olaus
III. 20 Sueno II 21 Canuius 22 Magnus 23 Haraldus II 24 Magnus II 23 Magnue III
26 Ingo 27 Aquinus of Norw. 27 Marg. of Den. by this marriage, the two
kingdoms of Denmark and Norwey were united, and never since disioyned; the
Danes keeping the natives so poor, that they are not able to resist them;
besides the strong Garrisons kept on all parts of the Country, keep it in an
absolute awe. The Christian Faith was first preached here by the means of Pope
Adrian the fourth. They followed the reformed Church after the opinions of
Luther; and speak the Dutch language; which is also common to their Lords of
Denmark, and neighbors of Sweden.
The Arms of this Kingdom are Gules, a Lion rampant Or, crowned and armed of
the first, in his paws a Dansk hatchet Arg.

The chief order of Knighthood is of the Elephant, Grimston.
instituted by Frederick the second king of Denmark; their badge is a collar
powdered with Elephants towred, circling the kings arms and having at the end
the picture of the Virgin Mary, There are reckoned in Denmark and Norwey
Archbishops 3 Dukes Earls Bishops 15 Marquesses Viscunts.


One University, namely Copenhagen.

Thus much of Denmark and Norwey.

OF SWETHLAND.
SWETHLAND is bounded on the East with Muscouie, on the West with the Dofrine
hills, on the North with the Frozen Seas, on the South with the Balticke seas.
These Balticke Seas are they which beginning at the narrow passage, called the
Sound, interlace the countries of Denmark, Swethlaud, Germany, and Poland, and
extend even to Livonia and Lituania. These Seas are by some called Mare
Su^vicum; by Pomponius Mela, Sinus Codanus; by Strabo, Sinus Venedicus: but
generally Mare Balticum, because the great Peninsula of Scandia was called
Baltia. The reasons why this sea being so large, does not ebb and flow, are 1
the narrowness of the straight by which the Ocean is let unto it; and secondly
the Northern situation of it, whereby the celestial influences produce therein
the lesser operation.

This country alone, without the adjacent Provinces of Lappia, Scricfinia, and
Barm^a, is little less then Italy and France joined together: and with the
additions of the said nations, is bigger by a circuit of 9^0 miles.

The people participate much in nature with the Norweians, as hospitable and
valiant as they: for from hence came the Goths, Suev^, Longobards, and other
barbarous Nations, which by their often inundations over all Europe, gave
occasion to the old adage, Omne malum ab Aquilono.

They were converted to the Christian Faith long since, and now follow the
doctrine of Luther, using the Dutch language, though not without an apparent
and notable difference, in pronunciation and Orthographie.

The soil is so fertile, that to see a bigger is a difficult matter; and the
air so healthful, that it is ordinary to see men of 130, or 140 years of
age. The country abounds with Mines of Lead, Copper, and Silver, which are
transported into other Nations, together with hides of Bucks, Goats, and Oxen,
Tallow, Tar, Barley, Malt, costly Furs, and the like.

The chief Provinces are,
1 LAPPIA the most Northern part of all Scandia, is divided into the Eastern,
Munster
containing Biarmia and Corelia, which belongs unto the Knez or Duke of
Russia: and the Eastern comprehending Lappia, properly so called, and
Scricfinnia, which are under the king of Sweden. Lappland is situate between
Scricfinnia, North; Sweden, South; the Dofrine hills, West; and S^nus Boddi^us,
East. The people derive their name from their blockish behavior, the word
Lappon signifying as much as inepius or insulsus in Latin. Scri^finnia lies
between I^apland and the frozen Ocean. They derive their name from the Finni, a
great people of Scandia, and Scricken a Dutch word, signifying leaping,
sliding, or bounding, for such is their gate: and moreover in that for their
more speedy sliding over the ice, of which this Country in the winter is full;
they used wooden-soaled shoes, with sharp bottomes, now in use among the
Germans, and by them called Scrickeshoenon, or sliding-shooes. The ancient
writers call this people Scrictofinni. These together with the Laplanders, use
to give worship and divine honor all the day following to that living creature
what ere it be, which they see at their first going out of their doors in a
morning: and are so poor, that they pay unto the King of Sweden for tribute,
rich skins, and furs; as being without the use of money, and benefit of
houses. They are of an indifferent good stature, and passing well skilled in
Archerie.

Maginus.
2 BODIA has on the North Scricfinnia; on the South Finland; on the East Sins
Finnicus, and part of Muscouie; on the West a large and capacious bay or
sea-gulet, which from hence is called Sinus Bodicns, The chief towns are 1
Virtis. 2 Vista. 3 Helsinga, honored with the title of a Dukedom.

3 FINLAND has on the North Bodia, on the South the Balticke Sea, or Mare
Suevicum; on the East Sinus Finnicus, and on the West Sinus Bodicus. It is by
Munster thought to be called Finland, quasi fine land, quod pulchrior and
amoenior sit Suecia, because it is a more fine and pleasing country then Sweden
it self. But indeed it is so called from the Finni or Fenni, a potent Nation
who have here dwelt, whose character thus framed by Tacitus, Finnis m^ra
feritas, faeda paupertas: non arma, non equi, non penates; victuiherbae,
vestitui pelles, cubile humus; sola in sagi^tis spes, etc. agrees every way
with our present Finlander, especially those of Scricfinnia, and Finmarchia,
who are not so well reclaimed to ciuility, as the other. This Finland is very
populous as comprehending 1433 parishes, many of which contain 1000 Families.
The chief towns are 1 Abo, a Bishops seat. 2 Narne, a place of great
strength. Not far from these, are towns within the limits of Muscouie,
namely Viburge and Rivallia; Boterus.
the keeping of which Fortresses, stand the King in 10^000 Dollars yearly.
They are Forts excellently well seated, defending his own, and offending his
enemies territories: of which nature was Calice in France when the English
possessed it.

4 SWECIA or SWEDEN (...) so called, has on the East Sinus Bodicus, on the
West the Dosrine hills: on the North Lappia, and on the South Gothland. The
country is very fruitful and delicious, Maginus,
unless in some places where the cragginesse of the hills makes it more
barren, and less pleasing. The chief cities are 1 Vpsale, a famous Bishopric,
from whence all this tract is termed Archiepiscopatus Vpsalinsis, 2 Nicopia* a
Sea-town of good strength. 3 Coperdol, famous for its abundance of brass.

5 GOTHLAND is the best and richest Province of the North, and took name from
the Goths, whose Country it once was, and not quasi Good land, for its
goodness, and fertility. It is divided into the Island and the Continent; The
Island of Gothia is seated in the Balticke seas, being in length 18 miles, and 5
in breadth: it stands very convenient for the Danes to invade Sweden; which is
the reason it has bin so often in eithers possession; and is now under the
Swethlander. The chief town is Wisbich. The Co^tinent of Gothia is in the
hithermost part of Scand^a, next unto the kingdom of Denmark. It has in it
the great Lake Weret, which receiving 24 tiuers, disburdeneth it self at one
mouth, and that with such a noise and fury, that they call it, the Devils head.
The chief Cities are Stockholme, seated after the manner of Venice; a town in
which Christiern King of Denmark, committed unspeakable cruelties, filling the
channels with blood, Munster.
and the streets with dead bodies. 2 Lodusia a town of great traffic* 3
Waldbourge, a well fortified piece; and 4 Colmar, famous for its impregnable
castle.

The first people of this Gothia were the Vandals, who first went into Poland,
and afterward into Italy, Spain, and Afric: and the Goths, who being a
people of Scythia, called Ge^es, and Gepides, seated themselves in Misia.
Afterward for fear of the Romans, they returned into Scandivania, and
inhabited this part, since called Gothio; but not lik^ng the coldness of the
Climat, they returned again toward their former habitation of Misia, where
Decius the Emperor warred against them, to the death of himself and his son,
Anno 253. Not long after they were subdued by the Hu^nes, whereupon many of the
Goths not willing to endure the imperious command of that barbarou^ people,
obtained of Valeus and Valentinianus the Constantinop ^tan Emperors, a ^eat
toward the mouth of Danubius, Valens exacting of them in liew of his kindness,
unsupportable tributes, was by them vanquished; nor were they w^ll appeased
till the time of Theodosius, Zosimus.
Anno ^83: who made a firm peace with them. In his time there was a dissension
between Rha^ag^se and Alaric for the kingdom; which when Alaric had gotten,
Rhadaguse with 200000 men went into Italy, who were ^here starued and
slaughtered in the Appenine hills. To revenge this Massacre, his rival Alaric
went into Italy, in the time of H^norius the son of Theodosius, where he
conquered Rome, Campania an^ Naples. After him succeeded Athaulfus, who married
Placida, sister to Honorius; by whom he was persuaded to leave Italy, and go
into Spain: which was possessed by his successors, the space of 300 years.
Some of these Goths sent Colonies into the more Southern parts of France,
where they possessed Languedocke and Provence: and at last forgot the name of
Goths, and became French. About 77 years after the conquest of Spain they
were again sent for into Italy, by Zeno the Emperor, Anno 493: to repel the
fury of King Odoacer, and his Heruli; who being expulst, Theodoricke Captain
of the Goths, made himself King of Italy. The reason why the Goths were
rather wished for in Italy, the^ the Heruli; was, for that the Goths were, and
had of long time bin Christians; for we read that Theodosius Bishop of the
Goths, was present at the Ni^ene Council. They were generally infected with
the heresy of Arius, Socrat.
whereto they addicted themselves to feed the humor of Valens, co-partner with
Valentiniauus in the Empire. For there was not long before among the Goths a
civil war; Athanaricus, and Phritigernes being the leaders of the factions.
Phritigernes being overthrown fled to Valens, and of him received such
succors, that encountering again his enemy, he won the day; and to gratify
the Emperor (who mainely was addicted to Arrianisme) he commanded his subjects
to embrace that doctrine. Vliphas, Bishop of the Goths, at the same time
invented the Gothicke letters, and translated the holy Scriptures into that
language: Which labor the good old man might well have spared, (...) then the
service of the Church (as the Papists say) was only celebrated in the Greek
and Latin tongues. This king Theodoricke, whom Zeno called into Italy, was
King of the Ostrogothi, or Eastern Goths: who were the offspring of those that
remained in their country, Pezel. in Sl^id.
after the expeditio^ of Alari^ into Italy, and the West. Attila the Hunne
subdued them to his Empire, under which during his life they continued: but
after dis death, his sons falling at odds, were by Wilaner one of the Got^sh
bloudroyall, overthrown, and the Goths sea^ed in Pannonia. To Willamer
succeeded his brother Thendomir, who was the father of this Theodericke,
Theodericke was in his youth, kept as his fathers pledge in Constantinople,
where he was instructed in all the Grecian and Roman learning: And when Zeno
resolved to send him into Italy against Odoacer, he made him a Patrician of
the Empire. This honor of the Patriciatus was devised by Constantine, that
great innouator in the Roman Empire: and they who were dignified with it, were
by the constitutions of the Emperor, to take precedence of the Praef^ct^
Praetorio. And so much did Charlemaigne prize this attribute, that he assumed
it as an additament to his style of Emperor. Theodoricke having vanquished and
slain Odoacer, strengthened himself diverse ways in the Country; first by
alliances and then by fortresses. He took to wife Adelheida, daughter to
Clodovem K. of the Frank^. His sister Hammelfrede he gave in marriage to
Thrasimunde king of the Vandals in Africa, His niece Amelberge he married to
Hermanfridus king of the Turingians; and his daughter Amalusunta to Eutharicus,
a Prince among the Goths in Spain. Being thus backed with all the barbarous,
nations his neighbors; he built towns and forts along the Alps and the
Adriatique Sea, to impeach the passage of barba^ous people into Itaelie. His
Souldier^ and Captains he dispersed in sundry towns and villages; partly that
they might keep under the wavering ^alians; partly to mingle his people with
the me^ of Italy, in language, fashions, and marriages; and partly that he
might more easily in war command them, and in peace correct them. Italy which
was before a throughfare to the barbarous nations, and quite disordered by the
often inundations of such people, he reduced ^o so fortunate a government; that
before his death the footstepps of their miseries were trodden out, and a
general felicity diffused it self through all the Country. Such Cities as
were formerly defa^ed he repaired, strengthened, and beautified. In his wars
he was victorious, in his peace, just, wise, and affable. Finally, he was, as
Velleius says of M^robodunus, natione magis quam ratione barbarus; and of all
the Barbarous Princes that ever invaded the Roman Provinces; he went the most
in iudiciously to work in establishing his new co^quests; and even in our
days he may well stand as a pattern to such men as undertake the like
actions. The Gotish Kings in Italy. Procopius.

445 1 Theodoricus the first King, 33. 527 2 Amabasunta, a woman of most
perfect virtue, took upon her the Empire of government of the Goths, as
partner with her son Atalaric. She drove the Burgundians and Almain^s out of
Liguria; and was skillful in the languages of all nations that had any commerce
with the Rom^n Empire: insomuch that pro miraculo fuerit ipsam aud^re
loquentem. She reigned 8 years. 534 3 Theodatus, who being in wars with the
Romans, and willing before hand to know his success; was willed by a Jew to
shut up a number of Swine, and to give some of them Roman names, the others
Gothish. Not long after, the King and the Jew going to the sties, found the
Gothish Hogs all slain, and the Romans half vnbrisselled: whereon the Jew
foretold that the Goths should be discomfited, and the Romans loose much of
their strength: and so it happened. This kind of divination is called (...), and
has been prohibited by a general Council. 3. 537 4 Viti^es 6 540 5 Idobaldus
1 541 Araricus 1. 542 7 Totilas 11. 553 8 Teias, who being overcome by Narses,
submitted himself to the Roman Empire; after which time, they grew with the
Italians (as also with the French and Spaniards) into one nation. Their history
is thus briefly set down by Sylvester in his Du B^^tas.
The warl^ke Gothe which whilome issued forth
From ^he cola frozen Islands of the North,
In^^mpt by V^sta^a, but the air almost
Being there as cold as in the Balticke coast:
He wi^h v^ctorious arms Sclavonia gains,
The ^^ansily^n^^n, and Valachian plains.
Thence flies to Thracia, and then leaving Greeks,
G^eedy of spoil, four times he bravely seeks
To pluck from Rome, then Mars his minion;
The plumes which she from all the world had won,
Guided by Rhadaguise, and Alaricke,
Bold Vindimarus and Theodoricke.
Thence flies to France, from whence expulst, his legions
Rest ever since upon the Spanish Regions.
And let this suffice for the original, Empire, and decay of the Goths. Now
somewhat concerning the Swethlanders themselves, the beginning of which native
nation, I find very obscure, not mentioned by Munster or Crantzius, which two
(the l^st especially) purposely have written of them. Three der^^ations and
three only I find probable, the one taught me by Casp^r Peucerus, the other by
my own reading and observation. Peucerus then deriueth them from the Suevi,
who inhabited the Northern part of Germany, and from whom the Balticke Sea is
indeed by many approved writers termed Mare Suevicum: which people he
coniectureth to have been driven by the ^aci, and Goths into this Country,
and by changing only one letter, to be called Sueci. But this is not altogether
in my conceit so likely; for in fatali illa gentium emigratione, when almost
all nations shifted their seats; these Sueui retired partly into Swaben, and
the rest into Spain, as we have there said: of any expedition of theirs into
this Country negry quidem, we read not a word. Mine own opinion (if it be
lawful for me to insert mine own) is twofold: First, I refer their
original to the Suiones mentioned by Tacitus, and by him reputed to be strong
in men, armor, and shipping. That these Suiones were inhabiters of Scandia,
appears by two circumstances of the same author; viz: I that the people were
not permitted to wear weapons, quia subitos hostium incursus prohibet Oce^nus;
because the Ocean was unto them a sufficient rampire: which cannot be affirmed
of the German nations. 2ly, Because the Sea beyond this nation was reputed to
be the utmost bound of the whole world, trans Suiones mare aliud quo cingi
claudique terrarum orbem fides, which we know still to hold good in Sweden.
And 3ly, by a passage in the old Annals of Lewis the 2d Emper^ur, where it is
said, that the Danes (relicta patria apud Sueones exulabant) were banished into
the Country of the Sueones, which doubtless was this Sweden. Now (for
applications sake) most certain it is, that Sueones is the true and ancient
name of this people; and by the names of Sueones or Sueci are they called both
in Munster and Crantzius abouenamed. My second derivation is from the Suethans
and Suethidi, mentioned by Iornandes, and by him placed in the I Will of Scanzia;
for such, by old writers, was this great Peninsula esteemed to be. Now that
these are the Suecians or Swethlanders, appears first by the propinquitie of
the names. 2ly, In that he makes the Finlanders or Finni and Finnauhae to be
their near neighbors: and 3ly, in that by the same author they are affirmed
to have furnished the Romans with rich Furs, and the skins of wild beasts;
with which commodities this country is abundantly stored. To which of these
opinions to adhere, I am not yet resolute: what now, if I should say that these
Sueones and Suethans, were but one people, and to have had these diverse names
according to the diverse ages of Authors? If I did, it were but my guess; and
sometimes better men conjecture as improbably.

There have been diverse Kings of Swethland, which their own histories cannot
number aright: we will therefore begin with I^^manicus, the contemporarie of
Charlemaigne, of whose successors there is more certainty and continuation.

since the time of Ma^garet Queen of Danemarke; reuo^te* and chose one Carolus
Canutus, Ao 1448 1448 33 Carolus Canutus one of the meanest of the Nobil^ty was
chosen King. He having incurred the displeasure of his Nobles, and fearing a
change of for^un^; gathered together all the money and treasure he could;
sledde unto Dantzicke, and there ended his d^ies. In the mean time the Swedens
appointed among them one whom they called their Marshall; under whose several
conducts they vanquished Christierne, and John his son Kings of Denmark. Of
these Marshalls there were three in number, Steno, Suanto, and Steno Stur: of
which the two first died naturally, and the last by Christiern the 2d slain in
battle; Sweden was by the treachery of Gustanus Archbishop of Vpsall,
betrayed and yielded to the Dane, Anno 1519. 1519 ^4 Christierne King of
D^nemarke and Norwey, used his victory so cruelly here, and his subjects so
insolently at home: that here he was outed by Gustanus Ericus, and driven from
Danemarke by his Uncle Frederick Ao 1523 1523 35 Gustanus Eric^s, the restorer
of his Countries liberty. 38. 1561 36 Ericus son to ^ustanus, 8. 1569 37

to the Church of Rome, after he had reigned 1^ years. 39 Charl^s King of
Swed^n, 1^. 1617 40 Gus^a^us Ad^^p^us, son to ^harles now living.
The revenewes o^ this kingdom cannot but be great, the King having some
means to augment his Treasure. 1 The tenths of Ecclesiastical livings. 2
Mines. 3 Tributes. 4 Customs. In the year 1578, all charges of Court and
army deducted, the King coffered up 700000 German Dollars.

The men of war are more obedient to their Prince then any Northern
Soldiers whatsoever, because the King gives unto every soldier victuals, and
that according to their obedience and desert: 2 If a Soldier be taken by the
enemy the King does usually redeem him: 3 If a Soldiers horse be slain
under him, the King most graciously gives him another. By this means the
Kings are very potent in wars, and though they were once much inferior to
the Danes, yet are they now equal to him; and as much superior to the
Muscovite. They are supposed to have 8000 great brass pe^ces for the wars:
and that in the Castle of the town of Stockholme only there are 400 of proof
sufficient.

The Arms of this kingdom are Azure, Bara.

Thus much of Swethland.

OF MVSCOVIE.
MVSCOVIA is bounded on the East with Tartary, on the West with Livonia,
Maginus.
Lituania, and part of Sweden; on the North with the Frozen Ocean; on the South
with Mare Caspium the Turks, and Palus Maeotis. This Country stands partly
in Europe, partly in Asia. It takes its name from Musco, the chief City; and
is also called Russia alba, to distinguish it from Russia nigra, a province of
Poland. The reason whereof, says one, speaking of the Muscovite, is, quod
incolae omnium regionum ipsius imperio subiectarum, vestibus albis and pileis
plerunque vtantur, because the inhabitants wear white caps? And why not?
Sithence the inhabitants of Margiana and Sogdian^ in Asia, are called
Iesel^^sse; only because they wear green turbants, the name importing as
much.

It is in length from East to West 3300 miles, and in breadth 3065 miles: it is
situate between the 8th and the 20th Climats, the longest day in the Southern
parts, being but 16 hours long and a half, in the Northern parts almost 22
hours long, and a hal^e.

The people are persidious, swift of foot, strong of body, and unnatural, ^he
father insulting on the son, and he again over his father and mother. So
malicious one toward another, that you shall have a man hide some of his own
goods in his house whom h^ hates; and then accuse him for the stealth of them.
They are exceedingly given to drink, insomuch that all heady and intoxicating
drinks are by statute prohibited: and two or three days only in a whole
year, allowed them to be drunk in. They are for the most part of a square
proportion, broad, short, and thick; gray eyed, broad-bearded, and generally
are furnished with prominent panches. The Commons live in miserable subjection
to the Nobles; and they again in as great slavery to the Duke or Emperor: to
whom no man dares immediately exhibit a petition, or make known his grieuances:
nay the meaner Lords are squeamish in this kind, and but on great submission
will not commend unto the Duke a poor man's cause. They are altogether
unlearned; even the Priests are meanly indoctrinated; it being cautionated by
the great Duke that there be no Schools, lest there should be any Scholars
but himsel^e: so that the people use to break the Sabbath, holding it fit only
to be kept by Gentlemen: and to say in a difficult question, God and our great
Duke know all this: and in other talk, All we enjoy health and life; all from
our great Duke. The women are private fearful to offend, but once lascivious,
intollerably wanton. It is the fashion of these women to love that husband best
which beats them most; and to think themselves neither loved nor regarded,
unless they be twice or thrice aday welfauoredly swadled. The author of the
Treasury of times, tells a story of a German Shoemaker, who traveling into
this Country, and here marrying a widow, used her with all kindness that a
woman could (as he thought) desire; yet did not she seem contented. At last
learning where the fault was, and that his not beating her, was the cause of
her pensiveness; he took such a vain in cudgelling her sides, that in the end
the hangman was fain to break his neck for his labor.

They use the Sclauonian language, and received the Christian says Anno 987:
in which they follow the Church of Greece, and differ from the Romish and
reformed Churches: 1 Denying the holy Ghost to proceed from the Father, and the
Son. 2ly, Denying Purgatory, but praying for the dead. 3ly, Believing that
holy men enjoy not the presence of God, before the resurrection. 4ly,
Communicating in both kinds; but using leauened bread, and mingling warm
water with wine: which both together they distribute with a spoone. 5ly,
Receiving Children of seven years old to the Sacrament, because then they
begin to sin^e. 6ly, For bidding extreme unction, confirmation, and fourth
marriages. 7ly, Admitting none to orders but such as are married; and
prohibiting marriage to them who are actually in orders. 8ly, Rejecting carved
Images, but admitting the painted 9ly, Observing four Lents in the year.
10ly, Reputing it unlawful to fast on Saturdaies. This diversity between the
Romanists and this people in points of religion; has bred such a difference
between them in love, and made the one so hard co^ceited of the other: that if
a Muscouite be known or suspected to have conversed with any of the Church of
Rome, he is accounted to be a polluted person: and must be solemnly purged and
purified before he shall be received or admitted to partake of the blessed
Communion.

In matters of war the people are indifferently able, Maginus.
as being almost in continual broils with their neighbors; and have a
custom that when they go to the wars, every Soldier gives unto the
Emperor a piece of money; which after the end of the wars, he again
receaueth of him: by which means the number of the slain is exactly known.
At their funerals they use to put a penny in the mouth of the deceased, a
pair of shoes on his feet, and a letter in his hand directed (such is their
superstition) to St Nicholas, whom they deem to be the porter of heaven: an
opinion doubtless very prejudicial to the Popes, and St Peter's prerogatives.

This Country is not so populous as spacious, the Eastern parts are vexed with
the Tartars, who like Aesops dog will neither dwell there themselves, nor
suffer the Muscovite to plant Colonies there: the Western parts are almost as
much molested by the Sweden and Polonian Kings: the Southern by the Turks and
Precopenfes: and the Northern by the coldness of the air; which is of such
vehemence; that water thrown up into the air, will turn to ice before it
fall to the ground. The better to resist this extremity of this cold, not only
the clothes of this people, but their very houses are lined with thick
furs. Every Gentleman or man of note has in his dwelling house a Stoue, or
hot-house; in which they keep, as it were, to thaw themselves. Such as travel
on the way, use often to rub their nose and ears with snow or ice, to settle
and recall the motive spirits into these parts; which otherwise they would be
in a danger to loose: the ignorance of which preventing surgery, was not the
least cause that in the year 1598, of 70000 Tu^kes, which made an intode into
Muscovie, 40000 were frozen to death. This excess of cold in the air, gave
occasion to Castilian in his Aulicus, wittily and not incongruously to feign,
that if two men being somewhat distant talk together in the winter, their
words will be so frozen that they cannot be heard; but if the parties in the
spring return to the same place, their words will melt in the same order that
they were frozen and spoken, and be plainly understood. Such is their Winter,
neither is their Summer less miraculous. For the huge seas of Ice, which in a
manner covered the whole surface of the Country, are at the first approach of
the Sun suddenly dissolved, the waters quickly dried up, and the earth
dressed in her holyday apparel, such a mature growth of fruits, such
flourishing of herbs, such chirping of birds, as if ^ere were a perpetual
spring.

The chief commodities which they send abroad, are rich Furs; others of
less note are Flax, Hemp, Whales grease, honey, Wax, Canvasses, Nuts, and the
like.

The revenues of this Empire cannot but be great, the Great Duke being Lord
both of the lives and goods of his Subjects: Mahomet a Turkish Bashaw was wont
to say, that his master and the Muscovite were the most absolute Princes in the
world. His revenewes in money (his household charge being defrayed) amount to 3
Millions of Rubbles. He is apparelled like a King and a Bishop; wearing with
his royal vestiment a Miter and a Crosier staff. When he sits in his
state, all the plate of his house is set before him; with a great number of the
grauest and seemliest men of all Musco, and the adjoining Cities richly
apparelled out of the wardrope: Archb. Ab.
which to Forreiners, not knowing this cunning fraud, appear so many Princes
and Noble men; and is no small cause of admiration and wonder at his
magnificence.

The Country may be (as rightly it is) called the Mother of Rivers; the chief
of which are Don or Tanais, which was by the ancient Geographers, thought to
be the only bound twixt Europe and Asia: it disburdeneth it self into Palus
Maeotis, 2 Duina, which enters into the Scythian Seas, at the Abbie of St
Nicholas; where the English since the discovery of the Northern passage, use
to land; and disperse themselves into all the parts of this vast Empire. And
truly there is no nation so kindly entertained amongst the Russians both Prince
and people, as the English; who have many immunities not granted to other
nations. The cause I cannot but attribute to the neuer-dying fame of our late
Queen, admired and loved of the Barbarians; and also to the conformable
behavior of the English in general; which is so accepted, that when
Wasiliwich or Basiliades nayl'd the hat of an other foreign Ambassador to his
head for his peremptorinesse: he at the same time, used our S^ Thomas Smith
with all courtesy immaginable. Another time when the Jesuit Possevinus, Archb.
Ab.
began to exhort him to accept the Romish faith; upon the information of our
Ambassador, that the Pope was a proud prelate, and would make Kings kiss his
feet: he grew into such a rage, that Possevinus thought he would have beaten
out his brains. This friendship between these nations, has been since
maintained by mutual Embassaies on both parties. The third river of note, is
Boristenes, called also Neiper, (as Duina is Oby) which augmenteth the waters
of Pontus Euxinus. Maginus*
4 Duina minor, now called O^ega, which opens its mouth to rece^ue the waters
of the Bal^^cke Sea. 5 Vo^ga, which with no less then 70 mouths, vomits his
soul into the Mare Caspium and^.

The chief Provinces are 1 NOVIGORDIA, in which is the famous Town No^o^rod
on the coast of the Bal^^cke Seas* one of the four ancient M^^t Towns of
Europ: S.W. Ral.
now decayed since the dis^ouery of the new passage unto S Nicholas, by O^y or
Duina. This Novogrod is seated on the less^^ Duina. Nigh unto this Town was
fought the battle between the Sarmatians, or Scythians of Europe, and their
slaves. For when the Asiaticke Scythes went to plant themselves in Media, with
the Provinces adjoining; these Sarmatians inhabiting Poland, went with the^, to
see them settled. Their long stay caused their wives willing to make use of any
pretense to comfort themselves at bed and board with their slaves; to whom
they bore a lusty bro^d of youths. These now well grown, and hearing the
unwelcome tidings of the Sarmatians* return out of Asia, join together: the
slaves to retain the freedom and Lordship they had got: the wives for fear
of their husbands fury: the young men for defense of their fathers and mothers.
With joint forces they go to meet them before their entry into the country;
neither are the masters slow, hoping to take them unprovided. At this Town
they have the first sight of each other. The masters ^earning to defile their
swords on their slaves, assault them with Horse-whips, and got the victory. In
memory of this battle, the N^vogrodians have ever since stamped their money
with the figure of a Horseman shaking a whip in his hand. And it is the
custom over all Museovie, that a maid in time of wooing, sends to that suitor
whom she chooses for her husband, such a whip, curiously by her self wrought,
in token of her subjection.

Maginus.
2 PLESCOVIA, whose chief town is Pl^scowe: this being the only walled Towned
in Russia. This country is in length 330 miles, about 130 in breadth; and was
conquered by Basilius 1509.

3 VALADOMIRE, is distant from Muscovie about 70 miles. The soil is so
fruitful, that one bushel of corn ordinarily returns 20, and sometimes 25
bushells. The chief town so named was once the Metropolis of Russia.

4 RHEZAN, so plentiful of corn, that Birds and Horses can neither fly nor
run through it, by reason of its thickness; the chief city is Rhezen. This
is the ser^ilest country in all Musco^ie and most rich; abounding with Grain,
Honey, Fish, and Foul, sans number: and is so well replenished with able men,
that the great Duke can from hence levy 25000 Horse, and 40000 Foot. Here is
the head of the famous river Tanais.

5 SEVERIA, a great Province, lies fast upon Palus Maeotis. The chief Towns
are 1 Staradub, and 2 Pativola. The people are very valiant.

6 SMOLENSKO, Adrianus.
whose chief city is Smolensko.

7 RESCOVIE, whose chief city is Toropyerz.

8 ROSTOWIA, whose Metropolis is Coloprigod.

9 CORELIA, where Laudiskron is the chief Town.

10 PERMIA, where there is such abundance of stagges, that the people eat them
(as the people of Norw^y do fish) instead of bread: the prime City is
Sicwiarksey.

11 CONDORA being beyond the Articke. In this country they have for half a
year together, perpetual day; and for the other half, as long a night.

12 PETZORA, the most Northeast parts of Muscovie. In this country the hills
which the ancients called Riphe^, Maginus.
and Hyperbore^ montes do end. They are thought to be perpetually covered
with snow, and are here of that height, that a cert^ine man having for 17
days together traveled up them; returned back again, as despairing ever to
come to the top. The people here have for some months continual day. They are
a simple nation, and received the Russian faith and Empire together, Ao 1518.

13 The kingdom of CASAN and CITRAHAM.

14 MUSCOVIA, so named of Musco the prime City, to which Daniel the 4th Lord,
translated his regal seat from Volodmire. It was once 9 miles in circuit,
Boter.
but was fired by the Tartar Anno 1571, where there were burnt 80000 men: and
it is now become but 5 miles round, and is adorned with 16 Churches; whereof
half and more, are made with wood and dirt, as most of the houses are. The
Palace of the Duke is seated in the very middle of the City, Maginus.
fortefied with 17 Turrets and three great Bulwarks; and guarded continually
with 25000 Soldiers. This Province is the greatest and most populous of all
this Empire; for it extends from East to West no less then 2000 miles; and
out of this, the great Duke can suddenly levy 70000 footmen, and 3000 horse.
The other lesser Provinces as Biela, Tuver, Mosaiskie, Wolochda, I^gra, and
Bieleiezioro (in which last, the Duke has a strong fortress which is usually
his treasure house, and to which in time of need he usually flies; besides
many others, I purposely omit..

This country was called formerly Scythia Europaa, and was never totally known
either by the Grecians or Romans. Anno 1240, Boterus.
the Tartars first made it tributary, who were afterward shrewdly weakened, by
the valor of John the first Great Duke: to whom they afterward yielded the
Country, conditionally that once every year within the Castle of Mosco, the
Great D. standing on foot, should feed the horse of the Crim Tartar, with Oats
out of his own cap. This homage was by Basilius changed to a tribute of
Furs; which being also denied, gave occasions of the war between the Tartar
and the Muscovite: which the Tartars make either by saddai^e incursions; or by
arms royal, at which time there come seldom fewer then 200000 fighting men
into the field.

Io. Aubrie.
The Chorographical describer of Muscouia, makes mention of the Princes of it,
ever since the days of Augustus; but without any great show of truth, no
computation of time, or relation of atchieuements. I commend the Authors
modesty, in not stuffing up his treatise with actions merely fabulous, of which
could neither be ground nor possibility: yet can I not acquit him for putting
down so many names to so little purpose. We will therefore omit them, and begin
our Catalogue with George; who both bare the brunt of the Tartars invasion, and
after the retreat of their greatest forces, began again to taste the sweetness
of sovereignty: yet not so free, but that he and nine of his successors were
tributaries to the Tartar; none of the^ performing any thing worthy the
rehearsing.

The Great Dukes
1 John the first Great Duke, shook off the Tartarian bondage. 2 Basilius
Casaen won the Provinces of Severia, Roscouia, and Smolensko. 3 John Basilius
conquered Livonia, and Lituania; both which his successor 1548 4 Johannes
Basiliades, or Wasiliwicke, lost in his age; though in his youth he had subdued

The formality with which the Emperors of Russia are invested or settled in
the Throne, are not many, nor stately; such as they be, I h^re afford you out
of the history of the life of Johannes Basiliades, written in Latin by Paulus
Oderbornius. On the 2d of June, A^o 1583. Theod^rus Iohannides went toward the
Temple of S. Michael, being the principal Church in all Musco: the streets all
covered with flowers, the doors of the citizens crowned with garlands, the
Air ecchoing with the noise of Flutes and Trumpets, and the people so crowding
to behold their Prince, that had not the Guard with naked swords forced a
passage through them, it had bin impossible for him to have gone on. Being now
come to the Church door, the Lords of the Country ( Cneses they there call
them) went out to meet him; and the Archbishop of Musco clad in his
pontificalibus, when he was come into the Church, embraced him. The pauement of
the Church was hidden with Tapest^ie, and the walls adorned with costly
hangings. The great Duke sat down in his Throne, being attired in a garment of
silk, buttoned down with golden butto^s: on his head he ware a purple cap,
sp^ngled with rich jewels; and on his fingers abundance of rings. Being thus
seated, the Archbishop prayed unto God to bless him, his people, and his
government, which was seconded by the joyful shoutes of his subjects; amongst
whom no small store of silver money was slung about by the Treasurer, and so
they returned to the Palace.

OF POLAND.
Maginus.
POLAND is limited on the East with N^iper or B^risthenes, which parts it from
Muscouie; on the West with Vi^^ula, which parts it from Germany; on the
North with the Balticke sea, and Sinus Finnicu^; on the South with Hungary.

The most ancient name of it was Sarmatia, and the people Sauroma^ae: it is now
called Poland, from Pole, which in the Sclavonian tongue sign fieth plain,
because the Count^y is so little swollen with hills. It is in compass 2600
miles, and is situate in the more Northern part of the temperate Zone, being
under the 8th and 12th Climats, and the longest day being 18 hours.

The Country is plain and woodie, and the Air so cold, that they have neither
wine nor grapes; instead of which they v^e that kind of drink called Ale, which
was heretofore counted the usual b^nerage of England only, and this Poland.
Barley they have and pulse in such abundance, that no small quantity of these
grain, is from hence transferred into other Regions: neither in number of
Cattle do they give way to Denmark, or Hungary.

The people are very industrious, and st^dious of all languages, e^pecially the
Latin; to which they are so devoted, that you shall hardly find a mean man,
Boterus.
which is not able in some measure to express himself in that tongue. They are
according to their abilities rather prodigal, then truly liberal; and are
generally good Soldiers; the Gentlemen free, the Peazants in miserable
sub^ection to their Lords: amongst which Lords there is such an equality, that
no man's estate exceeds 25000 Duckat, yearly. Proud they are, and impatient,
delicious in diet, and costly in attire; which last qualities are common also
to the women; who are for the most part indifferently fair, and rather witty,
then well spoken.

They use the Sclavonian language, and received the Christian Faith, Anno 963.
They are of all Religions; some following the Romish, others the reformed
Church; and of these some embrace the doctrine of Luther, others of Calvin;
some the Bohemian, some the August^ne, and some the Helvetian confessions. Here
are Ies^i^s and Arrians, Anabaptists, Anti-trinitarians, and all Sects
wha^soeuer* tolerated; whence it is said, if a man has lost his Religion, let
him to Poland, and he shall be s^^e to find it, or else believe it is vanished: a
saying now applied to Amste^d^m in Holland. It is a custom here, that when in
their Churches the G^sp^l is reading, the Nobility and Gentry of this Country,
draw out their swords, signifying that they are ready to defend the same, if
any dare opp^gne it. The same reason doubtless ga^e beginning to our custom
of standing up at the Cr^ed; whereby we express how prepared and resolute we
are to maintain it: though now of late some more nice then wise* holding it to
be a relic of Popery, do indiscreetly refuse it.

The chief merchandises that go from hence to other Provinces, are Amber,
Barley, Wax, Honey, Hemp, Pitch, Tar, etc.

The King is elected by the general States, who for the most part choose a
warrior; Bot^rus.
to whom, being crowned, the Nobility are as familiar as he were their brother,
and account his decrees to last but three days: They have no written laws:
custom and temporary Statutes, being the rule of their government, and
obedience.

The revenues of the kingdom are about 600000 crowns, most of which are put
up in his Treasury: For the Kingdom is divided into 4 parts, every part of it
keeping the King and his Court, in allowance and all expenses a quarter of a
year: and contributing money to the marriages of his daughters.

The chief rivers are Vistula, which has its fountain in the Carpathian
mountains, which part Hungary from Poland; his mouth is in the Balticke sea*
and is navigable 400 miles. 2 Neister, which parts it from Moldavia. 3
Neiper. 4 Ruben. 5 Beg. 6. Limbecke 7 Mimmel.

The chief Provinces are
1 LIVONIA, bounded on the East with Muscovie; on the West with the Balticke
sea; Munster
on the North with Finland; and on the South with Lituania. It is in length
500, in breadth 160 miles, and is a country exceeding mountainous and fennie;
yet withal so abundantly fruitful, that no small store of provision is sent
hence into other countries. The people received the Christian Faith partly by
the preaching of one Meinardus, Ao 1200: and partly by the compelling of the
Knights, called the Enfifers, or of the Portglaiue, who seconded the good
beginnings of that reverend man. The chief towns are 1 Riga an Archbishops
See. 2 Derpt, a town of great commerce. 3 Rivallia a strong fort in the hands
of the Swe^hlander. So also is 4 Narne, an exceeding strong sortresse, built by
a Polonian Architect, who for a reward had his eyes put out, to disable him
from making the like. Adrianus.
The chief Provinces of it are 1 Curland. 2 Senugal. 3 Estland. 4 Virland. 5
Harland. 6 Geroenland. This country was once subject unto the order of Dutch
Knights, who being molested by the Muscouite, in their reformation of Religion,
submitted themselves to Sigismund the king of Poland, Ao 1558: unto whose
successor King Stephen, the Musco^ite surrendered his title, Anno 1582:
reserving only to himself some Towns on the Eastern side. The rest is under
the Pollacque, except some few Towns on the North, subject to Sweden.

2 LITVANIA is South to Livonia, North to Podo^ia, East to Poland, Boterus.
and West unto Muscouie. The people received the Christian Faith, Anno 1386;
when as Iagello, afterward called Vladislaus, married Hedingis Q. of Poland;
which marriage this Province was united to Polonia. The chief Cities are Vilna
an University. Maginus.
2 Vilkomire: and 3 Brestia. The Air here is very sharp. the soil as barren
and unfruitful; searce so full of men as beasts, whose skins are their
chiefest commodities. They use here to be divorced and remarried as often as
they list. For a man to use the bed or body of an harlot, is counted a most
opprobrious crime: but for a woman to have her stallions, is so frequent and
unblameable, that the husbands call them Connubij adiutores, or their
fellow laborers, and prize them far above all the rest of their acquaintance.

3 VOLINIA is environed with Lituania, Podolia, and Russia; the people are
strong and warlike. It has as chief towns in it Kiovia, and Circassia, on the
banks of the river Neiper, and is a small woodie Province.

4 SAMOGITIA (whose inhabitants are most Idolaters, and build their houses with
straw) has for its chief town Camia. Munster.
It is a Northern Region, having Livonia on the North, and the Balticke sea on
the West: a Country full of wood, which is the chief commodity of it, there
being found in the midst of their trees very excellent honey, scarce having with
it any co^mixture of wax. Both these last Provinces, have followed the fortunes
of Lituania.

4 PODOLIA is limited with Lituania North, Maginus.
Neister South, Russia East, and Poland West; here the ground is so fertile,
that of one sowing, they have 3 Haruests; The chief cities are Camienza, seated
on high rocks, and deemed invincible. 2 Orkzacow, and 3 Winiecza.

5 RVSSIA NIGRA has on the East Podolia, on the West Poland, as also on the
North; and on the South Hungary. The chief towns are Leopolis or Lemburg,
built by Leo a Muscouite. 2 Grodecke. 3 Luckzo. These two Provinces were
incorporated to Poland by King Ladislaus, about the year 1440; by giving them
the freedom and prerogatives of native Polomans. It has the attribute of
Nigra, to distinguish it from Muscouia, which is Russia Alba; and was formerly
called Ruthenia and Roxolania. It is also called Russia Meridionalis, and is a
very fruitful Country, well stoared with fair horses, and numerous herds of
cattle.

6 MAZOVIA is environed with Russia, Prussia, Lituania, and Poland. It was so
called from one Massaus D. hereof, and has for its chief city Marzow, where
the best Methegl^n is made. It was joined to Polonia; by Casmure the I. Anno
1045.

Ortelius.
7 SPRVCE, PRVSSIA, or BORVSSIA, is situated on the North of Mazovia; having on
the North the Baltic seas; on the East Lituania, on the West Vistula. This
country yields abundance of Amber, which is the juice of a stone, which
grows like a coral, L. Guice.
in a mountain of the North sea, clean covered with water, and shunned by
mariners 3 leagues off for fear of wrack. In the months especially of
September and December, this liquor is by violence of the sea, rent from the
rock, and cast into the havens of this and the neighbor Countries. Besides the
beauty hereof, and the quality it has of burning like pitch, and attracting
strawes and iron like the Adamant; it is good for stopping the blood, falling
sickness, dropsies, and many other diseases.

The chief cities are Dan^scum, where Kecke man was Professor, a famous
Emporie: in which (to omit other things) are daily sold 1000 measures of wheat.
It is sited in Pomerania, but subject unto the P^lonian. 2 Mons Regius, called
by the Germans, Koningsberg, by us Regimount or Mount royal; it is seated at
the influxe of Pegel into the sea; and is a famous University in these parts,
it being founded by Duke Albert, 1525. 3 Heilsperge. Munster.
4 Maneburge, the seat of the masters of the Dutch Knights, it being translated
from Ptolemais or Acon in Syria, unto Venice, from thence to Marpurg; and so
hither by Sitridus the 12th great Master, Anno 1340, or thereabouts. 5
Aegenberge, and 6 Culne.

This Country was long time under the Dutch Knights, who being called by the
Muscouite against the Prussi^ns, here planted themselves, Ao 1239, the then
Master being Herman Salza. They continued long in wars with the Prussians
themselves, whom they found to be tough meat, and neither easily chewed, nor
quickly disgested. Having made an end with the^, they were assaulted by the
Polanders, unto whose King Casimire, they were compelied to become tributary,
Ao 1450, Lodovicus being the present, and from Henry Walpat the 18th Master.
Yet was not Lodovicus easily vanquished, he hauiug formerly driven the King out
of the field, routed his whole Army, slain 3000 of his men, and taken 136 of
his Nobility. Neither was he now overcome but by the rebellion of his own
people. Finally, peace was made between the Prussians and Poles, conditionally
that the King of Poland should have Dantzicke, and the Western parts; and that
Albert the Marquess of Brandenbourg, and then Master of the order, should
possess Regimount with the title of Duke; and should do homage for it to the
Polonian, taking in all assemblies his place at the kings right hand. Thi^
Duchy of Regimount contains 54 castles, Boterus.
and 86 towns; the revenues being yearly 120000 Ducats. The Arms of this
Duke are A, an Eagle V, membred and crowned O, langued G.

8 PODLASSIA has on the East Lituania, and on the west Maz^uia. Maginus.
The chief towns are 1 Tycockzin, a fort well furnished with munition, as
being the place wherein the Kings treasure is reserved. 2 Biesko 3 Knyssia,
where the Kings of Poland have a fine retiring house, as being well furnished
with parkes and fishponds, abundantly stored with game. This Country was united
unto the ^olish Diadem by Sigismund Augustus, Anno 1569.

9 The Dukedomes of OSWITZ and ZATOR, Bara.
so called of their chief Towns, are in Silesia: The first was conquered by
Cassimire the fourth, Ortelius.
Anno 1554: the last by Sigismund, 1547.

10 POLAND has on the East Lituania, on the West Germany, on the North
Mazonia, on the South Podolia. The Metropolis is Cracovia, built by Crocus a
Duke of Bohemia; seated on the bank of Vistula. 2 Lublin. 3 Guisna, whose
Archbishop in the absence of the King, or during the Inter-regnum, holds the
supreme authority, summoneth the diets, etc. 4 Siradia. 5 Sendonure. 6 Minsko.

Munster.
The first people of these parts were the Sarmatians, after the^ the Vandals;
afterward the Sclavonians, under the conduct of Lechius, first D. hereof, Anno
550: who flying from his native soil, together with Zechius his brother; saw
his brother settled in Bohemia, and then peopled this country, which for the
plainness he named Poland. His successors inioyed the title of Dukes only,
till the Emperor Otho the third, created the Duke Bosleslaus, King of Poland,
Anno 1000.

The chief orders of knighthood are,
Munster.
The Marian or Dutch knights, instituted under the walls of Acon, Ao 1190; Their
first master being Henry Walpot. They took their first name from S. Mary's
Church at Acon, when their order was allowed; and their second when they had
conquered Prussia. Their Ensign was a black Cross. The 34 Master of the order
was Albert, Marquess of Brandenbourg, who revolting from Sigismund King of
Poland, to whose Predecessor Casimire, the Knights had submitted themselves,
drew on the Country a long and miserable war 1511. Having for 14 years
valiantly maintained the liberty of the Country, and the credit of the order;
and in vain for 4 years together importuned the assistance of the Emperor
and Princes of Germany: he casts the order, and is by King Sigismund made D.
of Prussia, for him and his heirs for ever, Ao 1525, after this manner. Albert
attired in a complete habit of a master of the order, presented himself humbly
on his knees before King Sigismund, sitting in his Throne. The King raising him
from the ground, causes him to put off those Roabes, and attire himself in a
Dukall habit; which done, he gave him the Dukedom of Prussia, to hold in see
of him and his successors Kings of Poland. The company of Knights wonderfully
storm at this action, and retiring into Germany, chose one Walter Croneberg
for their titulary master. About 1549 they began to wax weary of their places;
and no new knights being desirous of that profitlesse order, it vanished in
short time into nothing.

OF HVNGARIE.
Maginus.
HVNGARIA is bounded on the East with Transiluania, and Walach^a: on the West
with Austria; on the North with Poland, on the South with Sclavon^a.

It was formerly called Pannonia inferior; Pannonia from the Pannones, Nicetas.
and inferior to distinguish it from Austria, which was Pannonia superior. It
is now called H^ngaria, quasi Hungauaria, from the Hunni and Avares, who here
dwelt. Of the Hunni we shall anon make further mention. The Avares were a
people of Scythia, which inhabited about Palus Maeotis, they began first to
stir^e in the reign of Justinius the 2d, and gave the Emperors forces a great
overthrow about the mouth of Danubius. Tiberius somewhat quieted them; but he
being dea^, they were again in heart, and with great courage warred against
Mauritius his successor. Their King was called Caganus (we may English it
Cham) it not being a proper name to one, but a common attribute to all their
leaders. This Caganus was the first that ever vanquished the Scythians: he made
wars against the Turks, which people was at this time first made known to
the inhabitants of Europe: he also with the help of his associats the Hunni,
invaded and possessed Pannonia, having vanquished the Goths and Gepidi, who
here dwelt. Against this Caganus, Mauritius the Emperor waged war, more with
an intent to revenge himself on his own soldiers, which had formerly offended
him, then with hope of prevailing against the enemy. Comentiolus according to
the Emperors directions, betrayeth his Army, 12000 of them were slain, and
the rest taken. Caganus a heroic and merciful Conqueror, offers to ransom
them for 8s 6d apiece, (for so much was that nummus, or (...), which he
demanded for them.) When the Emperor as much loving his gold, as hating his
soldiers, had denied that condition; he offered them all for one nummus, and
after for half a one: but being also herein unsatisfied, he put them all to
the sword. For this cause the rest of the soldiers not long after made Phocas,
one of the Centurions, Emperor; and he mo^^ barbarously stewed the Emperor in
his own broth, putting him, his wife, friends, and children to the sword.

It is situate in the Northern temperate Zone, Maginus.
under the 7th and 9th Climats, the longest day being 16 hours and a half.

The people are strong of body, but of rude behavior, respecting neither the
liberal Arts, nor mechanic Trades. The greatest aspersion is the name of a
Coward, which cannot be wiped off without the killing of a Turk; after which
they are privileged to wear a Feather. Their females are incapable of their
fathers possessions; yet they give them no portion, but a new coat at their
wedding; before which time neither man nor woman use to lie in beds. They use
the Scythian language, and were baptized not long before the year 1000: the
number of Protestants at this time, are far greater then of the Papists.

The soil is wonderful fruitful, yielding corn there thrice in a year; the
grass in some places (as in the I Will of Comara) exceeding the height of a man:
which does feed such a number of cattle, that it is thought this Country alone
to be able to feed all Europe with flesh. They yearly send into Germany and
Sclavonia 80000 Oxen: Ortelius.
they have Dear, Partridge, Pheasant, in such abundance, that any man that
will may kill them; which in other places is utterly prohibited, Sleid Com.
these Foul being reserved as game for Gentlemen. At that great insurrection
of the Boores in Germany, before the end of which 50000 of them were slain;
their chief demands were, that they might choose their own ministers; 2ly that
they might pay no tithes but of corn; 3ly that they might be free from the
power of magistrates* 4ly that woods, timber, and fuel might be common; 5l^ and
especially, that they might hunt and hawke in all times and places. The other
commodities which are transported, are Gold, Silver, Fish, Copper, Wine, etc.

The worthiest Scholar that ever this kingdom produced, was S. Hicrome, a
worthy Father of the Church, borne in Stridon.

Knolls hist.
The most worthy soldier was Johannes Huniades, who so valiantly resisted the
incursions of the Turks: of whom he slew 50000 at the battle at Maxon: and 2ly
Matthias Corvinus, of whom thus says Adrianus out of a Poet, -- Patriae decus,
vnica stirpis
Gloria, Pannonicae caedis fort^ssimus ultor.
His Countries pride, the glory of his race,
Revenger of the Hungarians late disgrace.
To requi^e this overthrow of Maxon, the Turks not long after in the battle of
Varne, slew the King Ladisl^us, and 30000 of his Soldiers: a battle against
which, faithful Huniades much opposed. For the Hungarians having made truce
with the Turks, the Popes Legate upon a seeming advantage, ob^ol^ed the
Christians of their oaths; who falling on the Turks, so daunted them, that
Amurath lifting up his eyes to Heaven, prayed unto Christ to look upon the
perfidious dealing of his C^ristians, who had for their own advantage,
dishonored his name and their profession; after which prayer, the Christians
began to give back, and lost the day. Matthias Corvinus, afterward K. of
Hungary, was son to this Huniades; a son worthy of such a father, as being
the chief prop of his country against the Turks: which after his death, fell
into the hands of Solomon.

The principal rivers are 1 Danubius, which is here called Ister, which name
continues to his very Estuarium. 2 Savus, which rising in Carniola. 3 Dravus,
which rising in Carinthia; and 4 Tibuscus which rising in the Carpathian

that two parts are water, and the third fish.

This kingdom now stands divided between the Turk and the Hungarian;

his small retinue, slew his horse under him, and at last himself, having in
that skirmish received 16 wounds. There were slain also amongst other Nobles,
Terquatus a Prince of Italy, Marquess Gonzaga, and Count Verdugo. I had almost

taken Anno 1566, by Solomon the magnificent, who there ended his days: and
Keresture, where Anno 1596, Mahomet the third gave the Christians so great an
overthrow; that if he had pursued his victory, he had finished the conquest of
Hungary: which has withstood the Turkish puissance, for the space of 160
years.

This Country was first inhabited by the Pannones, Munster.
displaced by the Goths; who going to Italy, left this kingdom to the Hunnes,
and then to the Lombards. These being a people of Scandia, were first called
Winnili; afterward ob longas barbas, Longobardi: But concerning this last
name, take along with you this old wives tale, recited, but not approved by
Paulus Diaconus. The Vandales warring upon the Winnili, went unto Goddan (he
should rather have said Woden) to sue for the victory: which the Winnili
hearing, wrought by countermine, and sent Gambata, the mother of their King
A^on, on the like business to Frea, Goddans wife. So it was, that Goddan had
promised the Vandals, that they should be victorious, whom he saw first in the
morning; whereupon Frea willing to please Gamba^^, and not loving, as it
seems, the sight of men; gave order, that all the women of the Winnili
parting their hair, bringing one half over one cheek, the other over the
other, and tying both under their chin, should appear betimes before the
window the next morning. This they did, and she showing them to her Husband, he
demanded of her, Qui sunt isti Longobardi? Hence the name. They were compelled
by scarcity of victual, to seek new habitations: Munster.
and first they seized on the Island Ragia, and the adjacent Continent; next
upon Poland; then upon this Pannonia; and at last under the leading of
Alboinus, went into Italy, where after 200 years, their Kingdom was
ouerthrown by Charlemaine. Of the Longobardian Kings ensuing, I will
particularly make mention only of Lamissus, and of him this Story. Agilmond
the second King of the Lombards, one morning went a hunting. As he was riding
by a fish pond, he spied seven children sprawling for life, which one (as faith
Paulus Diaconus) or (it may be) many harlots had bin delivered of, and most
barbarous^y thrown into the water. The King amazed at this spectacle, put his
borespeare or hunting pole among them. One of the children hand-fasted the
spear, and the King softly drawing back his hand, wafted the child to the
shore. This boy he named Lamissus, from Lama, which in their language signified
a fish pond. He was in the Kings Court carefully brought up, where there
appeared in him such tokens of virtue and courage, that after the death of

the solicitation of Narses, went into Italy, and erected there the
Longobardian Kingdom; which 200 years after, was demolished by the puissance
of Charles the Great. The History of this people is Epitomized by Silvester, in
his Du Bartas, thus: The Lombard strong who was in Scowland nursed,
On Rugeland, and Liuonia seized first.
Then having well revenged on the Bulgarian
The death of Agilmont; the bold Barbarian
Surprises Poland; thence anon he presses
In Danows streams to rense his amber tresses:
When he straight after had surrendered
The double-named Isters flowrie bed,
To scarre-sac'd Hunnes: he hunteth furiously
The rest of Gauls, from wealthy Insubrie.
There reigns 200 years, triumphing so,
That royal Tesin might compare with Po,
Which after fell in French men's hands again,
Won by the sword of worthy Charlemaine.

At the departure of the Lombards into Italy, the Hunnes again settled
themselves in this Country, which they had before bin compelled by the Lombards
to abandon. These Hunnes were a people of Asia, Pezelius in Sleidan.
dwelling about the Hircanian sea, and made their first irruption into Europe,
Anno 373. Balamirus being their Captain of King, Munster.
Their first expedition was against the Ostrogothes, inhabiting the shores of
Pontus Euxinus, and Moeotis; whom without great difficulty they vanquished: and
pursuing their victories, broke into this Country, then called Pannonia.
Macrinus the Roman Lieftenant here encountered them in two set battles; in the
first he was victorious, but not without great loss, there being slain on both
sides, above 300000 men; in the second he was slain, and his army routed, the
Hunnes buying this victory with the loss of 40000 soldiers, Anno 401. These
Hunnes after this battle, quietly settled themselves in this Province, and
some 38 years after their first entrance into it, chose for their King one
Attila, a wise and valiant man; of whose wars, and how he should be called
^l^sgollum Dei, I have in sundry places told you. The Arms o^ this renowned
and victorious Captain, are (by Bara) said to be Gules, a Falcon displayed Or,
membred and armed Argent. After the death of Attila, who reigned 44 years, the
glory of the Hunnes began to decline, and was then in the Eclipse, when the
Lombards under the King Adoinus, forsook their habitation which they had
settled in the North parts of Germany, and subdued this Country, Anno 530. The
Lombards stayed not here long, but they were by Narses solicited to come into
Italy, which invitation they willingly accepted; and re-yeelded ap Pannonia to
the Hunnes, conditionally, that if their journey succeeded not prosperously,
they might be received and permitted to live amongst them. The Hunnes hearing
how happily the designs of the Lombards thriued in Italy, expected not their
return; but sent for the Avares, and others their confederates and allies, to
enjoy together with them the riches and goodness of this Region, which about
this time, and at their coming in, begun to be called Hungavaria. Long after
they were expelled by Charles the Great, but returned again to the number of
one million, in the days of the Emperor Arnulphus, about the year 900, and
recovered their forsaken habitations. Here have they since continued, but not
without a miserable affliction by the Tartars; 500000 of whom, tyrannized here
for the space of 3 years, committing incredible spoils and massacres, Anno
1248.

OF DACIA.
DACIA, is bounded on the East with the Euxine Seas; on the West with Hungary;
on the North with the Carpathian mountains; on the South with Haemus, by which
it is divided from Greece.

Stephanus
It took its name from the Daci, who first here inhabited; and afterward
passing into the Cimbrick Chersonesse were called Dani. This people was by
Strabo the Geographer called Davi: from which the Athenians in their Comoedies,
called the Servants and Sycophants by the name of Davus, because the Daui were
so servile and officious.

They were long free from the command of the Romans, and had their proprietary
kings, of whom the last was Decebalus, a man both ready in advice and quick in
execution. Dio^.
Against him Domitian made war by Iulianus his leiftenant, who gave Decebalus
a great overthrow, and had then utterly vanquished him, if his wit had not
better befriended him then his sword. For fearing least the Romans making use
of their victory, ^would enter and take possession of his Country; he pitched
in the way a great number of stakes in battle ray, putting on them the old
Corslets of his Soldiers. These stakes looking like so many men of arms,
frighted the enemy from approaching the Country. Traian^ was the next which
made war against him, and brought him to that exigent; that having with much
loss endured some few skirmishes, he yields himself, and is acknowledged a
friend to the Senate and people of Rome. But being one of a high spirit, and
borne in a free air, he once again fell off from the Romans, but to his own
destruction: for seeing by the valor of Traia^e, his kingdom conquered, and
his palace taken; he fell on his own sword, and left Dacia a Province of the
Roman Emperors.

The people are generally stubborn, and intractable: they speak the
Sclauonian language, and read like the Jews from the right hand to the left.
They are of the Christian faith, and follow the Greek Church.

The Country is sufficiently fruitful, enriched with Mines, and abound^ng with
Horses, whose manes hang down to the very ground.

It was first possessed by the Moesi, a people of Asia, whence it was by
Danubius divided into Misia superior, and Misia inferior; these gave place to
the Daci, Dani, or Davi; since whose time it is divided into 1 Transylvania. 2
Moldavia. 3 Walachia. 4 Servia. 5 Rascia. 6 Bulgaria. 7 Bosnia.

This Country is situate in the Northern temperate Zone, between the 7th and
10th Climates, the longest day being 17 hours.

The chief rivers are 1 Danubius. 2 Alluta. 3 Salvata. 4 Cockle. 5 Morus. and
6 Tinas.

1 TRANSYLVANIA. Quade.

TRANSYLVANIA, so called because it is penetrable no way but through woods; and
Sep^em Castrae, or in Dutch Zenburgen, or Zenbrooke, because of seven Castles
placed to defend the Frontiers: is limited on the North with the Carpathian
hills, on the South with Walachia, on the West with Hungary, on the East with
Moldavia.

The chief Towns are 1 Alba Iulia, or Weisenberg. 2 Claudiopolis, called now
Clausenberge. 3 Bristitia. 4 Centum colles. 5 Fogaros. 6 Stephanopoli, etc.

On the North end of Transylvania, lies the Province Zaculeia, whose people
live after the manner of the Helvetians: their chief and only Towns being 1
Kisdie. 2 Orby. and 3 Shepsdy. They have long maintained an offensive and
defensive league with the Transilvanians against Turks and Germans. They are
free from all manner of taxes and subsidies, excepting only the Coronation day
of the new king of Hungary, for then every housekeeper is to give the King a
Bull.

That the people of this Country are the progeny of the Saxons, is evident by
the Saxon language yet retained. 2ly, We find that Charles the Great, like a
politic conqueror, placed many of that nation here: weakening so their
strength at home, Versteg^n.
and fortifying the bounds of his Empire. And 3l^, by a story recited by
Verstegan, which we touched in our description of Brunswicke; the whole
narration is this. Halberstade was beyond credit troubled with Rattes, which a
Musician, whom they called the Pied Piper, undertakes for a great mass of
money to destroy; they agree: hereupon he tuneth his Pipes, and all the Rats in
the Town dancing after them, are drowned in the next river. This done, he
asks his pay, but is denied; whereupon he strikes up a new fit of mirth: all
the children male and female of the Town follow him into the hill Hame^en,
which presently closed again. The Parents miss their Children, and could
never hear news of them; now of late some have found them in this Country,
where I also leave them; only telling you this, that this marvelous accident
is said to happen the 22^^ of July, Anno D. 1376. Since which time the people
of Halberstade, permit not any Drum, Pipe, or other instrument to be sounded
in that street: and established a decree, that in all writings of contract or
bargain, after the date of our Saviors nativity, the date also of this their
childrens transm^gratio^ should be added.

This Transylvania was long subject unto Hungary, and had for its governor a
Vaivod, Knolls.
which was the second person in the kingdom. This Vaivodate was by King
Vladislaus given unto John Huniades, that terror of his enemies, and supporter
of his Country: and after his death to John Zepusius. This John was chosen King
of Hungary, but being expelled by Ferdinand, he called Solomon into the
kingdom, by whom he was restored and became the Turks Tributary: after whose
death Solomon seazing on the kingdom of Hungary, gave unto Stephen, his son,
the Vaivodate of Transylvania, Anno 1541. Unto this Stephen succeeded another
Stephen, called Bathori, by the gift of the T^rkish Emperors: who being
called to the kingdom of Poland, left this country to his brother Christopher,
Ao 1575 To him succeeded his son Sigismund, who shook off the Turkish yoke;
and although he gave them many overthrows and slew some of their Bashawes: yet
not being able to defend himself against so potent an adversary, he resigned
his principate to the Emperor Rod^lphus, Anno 1601. The Germane Soldiers
behauing themselves tyrannically over the people, were by Iustine Botscay,
newly chosen Prince, driven out of the Count^y: to whom succeeded Gabriel
Batour, Ao 1609; since whose death, so welcome to his neighbors and subjects;
the Sultan A^h^n^t, committed this Country unto Bethlem G^bour, that great
enim^e of the Austrian family.

2 MOLDAVIA.
MOLDAVIA is seated on the North end of Transylvania, Turk. hist,
and Zaculeia, and extends to the Euxine Sea. The chief Cities are
Occazonia, or Zucchania, once the Vaivods seat. 2 Fuechiana. and 3 Fal^z^nge.
It was first made Tributary to the Turks by Mahomet the great, and utterly
subjected, Ao 1594, by Selimus the 2d. Not long after it revolted from the
Turks, and made combination with the Transilvanian, Anno 1576. Walachia also
entered into this confederacy, against which they have since with great
alterations prosecuted: the Countries being sometimes under the protection of
the Emperors of Germany; some^imes of the Turk; sometimes of the Polander.
To this Moldavia belongs the little Country of Bessarabia, Maginus.
lying between mount Hoemus South, and Lituania North. It is seated very
commodiously on the Black Seas, and is so called from the Bessi, the ancient
inhabitants of this place, and the progenitors of the ^ofnians. It was made a
Turkish Province 1485. The chief Towns are 1 Kilim* and 2 Chermen or
Moncastrum the seat of a Turkish Sanziacke. It is built on the river Tira^, not
far from its influxe into the Sea.

3 WALACHIA.
WALACHIA, called more properly Flaccia, from Flaccus a Roman, who here planted
an Italian or Roman Colonie: is seated between Transilvan^a, and Danubius. The
people speak the Latin tongue, but so that it is much corrupted, and can
hardly be understood. The chief Cities are Sabinium. 2 Prailaba* and 3
Tergovista, Mereasor.
the Vaivods sent. The Country is abundant in all things necessary for the
life and use of man, as mines of gold silver, and iron; Salt Pits, Wine,
Cattle, and especially Horses, of which here is a number, no less great then
good. It yields also a pure and refined kind of Brimstone, of which they
make excellent Candles. Over the river Danubius, which divides this Country
from Bulgaria, did the Emperor Traian build his so memorized bridge, in his
war against the Dacians: of which 34 pillars yet are to be seen to the great
admiration of the beholders. This Country was conquered by M^homet the Great,
Turk. hist.
by reason of two brothers, Waldus and Dracula, who contended for the
principality. The Vaiv^ds paid to the Turks 60000 Ducats, which when Amurath
the 3d required to have doubled; Michael the Vaivod revolted, and joined with
the Vaivod of Moldavia and Prince of Transylvania, Anno 1594.

Guillim.
The Arms are Gules three Banners disveloped Or.

4 SERVIA.
SERVIA lies betwixt Bosnia and Rascia. The ancient possessours hereof were
the Triballi, who only had the happiness to vanquish Philip King of the
Macedonians. Iustine.
For Philip having or pretending a quarrel against Ma^aeas King of the
Sarma^ians; entered his Country, overthrew him in a set battle, carried with him
great booties; and among other things 20000 Mares for breed. These Mares he
took in the battle, it being the custom of the Scythians, and Sarmatians,
to use Mares only in their wars; because their not stopping in the midst of
a race to piss, could be no impediment to them in their flight. In his return
homeward, these Triballi deny him passage through their Country, vn^esse they
might partake of the spoils. This being denied, they fall from words to
blows, and next to a pitched field. In this fight Philip was wounded with an
Arrow, which passing through his thigh, nailed him to his Saddle, and the Horse
being gauled with the wound, fell down to the ground. The Macedonians seeing
his fall, and supposing that he was slain, fled out of the field; leaving all
the Sarmatian spoils to the Traballi; whose receauers they seem only to have
been.

The chief Cities are Stonibourg the seat of the Despot. 2 Samandria. 3
Taurinum, Adrianus.
now called Bellgrade, a town which being once the bulwark of Christendom,
valiantly resisted the puissance of Amurath the 6 and Mahomet the great, but
was at the last taken by Solymau, Anno 1520. It stands on the Danubius, where
it receaueth the river Savus.

5 RASCIA.
RASCIA lies between Servia and Bulgaria: the chief city is Boden famous for
her annual fayres.

These two Provinces were once subject to their several Despots, Turk. hist.
under whose command they long inioyed tranquillity, til Anno 1438: when as
George Despot of Servia and Rascia became tributary to Amurath the second.
After the death of this George; who was a Christian by profession, but a Turk
by affection (as all the actions of his life did lively demonstrate) his son
Lazarus succeeded: who being dead, Mahomet the great united these Provinces to
his Empire, Anno 1454.

6 BVLGARIA.
BVLGARIA has on the East the Euxine Sea, Adrianus.
on the West Rascia; on the North Danubius; on the South, Thrace. The chief
Cities are 1 Sophia the seat of the Beglerbeg of Greece, under whom are 21
Sansiakes. 2 Nicopolis. This Country was conquered by the Scythians of Bulgar
(a Town situate on the river Volga, Pezelius.
whence they are called Bulgari and Volgari) who making their irruptions in the
days of the Emperor Constantine Pogonatus, became bitter enemies to the
Christians till the year 868: in which their King Trebellius by the persuasion
of his sister (who being a captive had received the Chr^stian faith) together
with all his people was baptized. Seldom,
The Kings hereof had their Crown of gold, their tiar or cap of silk, and
their red shoes for their regal; which were also imperial ornaments. To
these Kings also, and to these only did the Greek Emperors allow the title of
(...), as being merely imperial. Other Kings they called (...), from the
Latin word Reges. Insomuch that when Basilius Macedo had received letters from
Pope Adrian the 2d, wherein Lewis the 2d the Western Emperor was called
Basilens: he razed out that Imperial attribute, and dispatched an Embassy to
Lewis, wherein he challenged it as his own peculiar Epethete. That reverend
father Theophilact was chief Bishop of this nation. This kingdom was made a
Turkish Province, by Bajazet the first, Anno 1396.

7 BOSNIA.
BOSNIA, so called of the Bossi or Bessi, a people of Bulgaria; bounded on the
East with Servia, on the West with Croatia, on the North with the river Savus,
on the South with Illyricum. The chief Cities are Cazachium the residence,
Turk. hist.
and Laiza, or Iaziga, the Sepulture of the Bosnian Kings. This Country was
erected into a Kingdom Anno 1420; not long after which, K. Stephen was taken
and flaine alive, by the barbarous command of Mahomet the Great; at which time
this kingdom was converted to a Province of the Mahumetan Empire, Anno 1464.

Thus much of Dacia.

OF SCLAVONIA.
SCLAVONIA, has on the East the river Drinus, and a line drawn from thence to
the sea, on the West part of Italy, on the North Hungary, and on the South the
Adriatique Sea.

It is in length 480 miles, and 120 in breadth; it is situated under the sixth
and seventh Climates, the longest day being 15 hours and a half.

The people are courageous, proud, and stubborn, and use their own Sclavonian
tongue, which extends through al Sclavonia. 2 Histria. Brerewood.
3 Bohemia. 4 Polonia. 5 Moravia. 6 Muscovie. 7 Dacia. 8 Epirus. 9 part of
Hungary. 10 Georgia. 11 Mengrelia. and 12 is used by all Captains and
Soldiers of the Emperors of Turkey.

They are of the Christian faith, and follow the Greek Church.

This Country is more fit for grazing then for haruesting; for the Sheep and
other Cattle bring forth young twice in a year, and are shorn four times.

The Sclavi whence this Region took denomination, Quade.
were a people of Scythia, who in the time of Justinian the Emperor, planted
themselves in Thrace: and after during the reign of Phocas, came and settled
themselves in Illyricum, since by their conquest of it, called Sclavonia. These
Sclavi were first broken by the Venetians, who seeing them to be of strong
bodies and able constitutions, employed them in all the offices of drudgery
belonging to their fields, and houses: from whence both we and other nations,
have borrowed that ignomintous word, Slave; whereby we use to call ignoble
fellows, and the more base sort of people: and this is the observation of Sr
W. Raleigh, in his most excellent History. Sclavonia is now divided into
Illyricum, Dalmatia, and Croatia. The principal rivers of the whole are, 1
Drinus, by which it is parted from Servia. 2 Savus. 3 Dravus. 4 Edavius. 5
Titius. 6 Naron.

1 ILLIRIS was once the name of the whole Province, but it is now accommodated
to one part: which being commonly called Windismarch, is bounded on the East
with Danubius; on the West with Carniola; on the North with Dravus, and on the
South with Savus. The chief Cities are 1 Zatha on Danubius 2 Zakaocz 3
Windishgretz on Dravus. and 4 Sagouna nigh unto Savus. Florus.
The people hereof were made subject unto the Romans, Ao V C. 525. they
themselves giving the occasion. For not content to make inrodes into, and to
lay wast the Roman territories, they slew the Ambassadors desiring
restitution, and used much opprobrious language unto the City: Tenta their
Queen, not only not forbidding, but commanding it. On this ground Fulvius
Cen^umalus is sent against them with an army, who subduing the Province;
sacrificed the chief of the nobility to the Ghosts of his murdered countrymen.
This country is now a member of the kingdom of Hungary.

2 DALMATIA has on the East Drinus; on the West Croatia; on the North Savus;
Grimst. ^o
and on the South the Adriatic sea. The chief Cities are Rag^si, formerly
called Epidaurus, situate on the Adriatique sea; a City of great traffic and
riches. It is tributary to the Turks to w^om i^ pays yearly 12000 Ducats.
2 Sebeni^um or S^^^m s^^n^ing on the Sea shore. 3 Zara or L^^era on the same
sho(...) For the possession of this Town, Ortelius.
there have been^ g^^at w^^res betw^xt the Hurgarians and the Venetians; to
whom it s^^meth to be of such importance; that b^ing on^e taken by the
Hurg^ria^s, it was redeemed for 100000 Crowns. In this T^wne is the Church of
S John di Malvatia, which was b^ilt by a company of Sayler^; who being in a
tempest made a vo^, that if they escaped they would consecrate a Temple to S.
John di Malvat^a, whose m^rter should be tempered with Malms^y, and accord^ngly
paid their vows. Far les^e did another master of a shipp intend to perform
his promise though he spoke bigger; who in a like extremity of danger; promised
our Lady to offer at her Altar, a Candle as great as the maine mast of his
ship. For when one of his mates iogging him, told him he had promised an
impossibility; tush fool (replied the master) we must speak her fair in
time of need: but if ever I come ashore, I will make her be content with a
Candle of eight to the pownd. And in a like fit of devotion was he, who on the
same occasion plainly told God, that he was no common beggar, he never
troubled him with prayers before: and if he would hear him that time, he would
never trouble him again. But I proceed. 4 Spalato a sea town standing East of
Sebenico, the Bishop whereof Mare^s Antonius de D^^minis seeming to loath the
Romish superstition, came for ^efuge into England, Anno 1616, and having here
both by preaching and writing labored to overthrow the Church of Rome; upon I
know not what proiects he declared himself to be a counterfeit, Anno 1622,
and returned again to Rome. So that we may say of him as Socrates in his
Ecclesiastical history; says of Ecebolius, who under Constantius, was a
Christian; under Julian a Pagan; and a Christian again under Iovinian: (...);
so warering and unconstant a ^urn-coat was Ec^holius, from his b^ginnings to
his end. The 5 town of note is Scodra or Scutari, which ^esisted the Turkish
puiss^^ce a whole year: Turk. hist.
and many days was battered with 70 p^^c^s of Ordnance, of wondrous bigness,
especially that called the Princes piece, which carried a stone or bullet of
1200 pownd waig^t. Not far^e hence is 6 Lissa famous for the Sepulcher of
Scanderbog. These 2 Towns were gained by Mahomet the 2d, Anno 1478.

The ancient inhabitants of this Country were the Dalmati, whose Metropolis was
Dalminium on the ^iuer Drinus. This City was sacked by Marcius a Roman
Consul, Ao V C 689; and Dalmatia first was s^st made subject to that Empire.
Afterward also this City was again ruined by one Nasica: but the people as
they were by the Romans often subdued, so they as often revolted. Their last
rebellion was raised at the instigation of one Batto, a man very potent with
the people; who having ten years together maintained the liberty of his
Country, at last broken and wearied by the forces of G^rmanicus, and Tiberius,
he submitted himself unto the two Captains: who asking the reason of his
revolt, were answered, because the Romans sent no Sheepheards to keep, but
Wolves to devour their flock, Dalmatia thus finally conquered, continued a
Roman Province, till the time of Phocas; during whose tyrannical Empire, the
S^lam subdued this Country: who after they had Lorded it ^e^e ^or the space of
almost 200 years, were made vassalls to the Hungarians; who settled themselves
in Pannonia, during the reign of Arnulphus in the West, and Leo Philosophus in
the East. These new Lords were much given to Piracy and robbing, and amongst
others, Hist. of It.
ravished a company of gorgeous Venetian Damsells: to revenge which wrong,
Dalma^ia was made tribu^ary to the Venetians; to whom, besides their money and
Towns the Dalmatians were to give 100 barrells of wine, and 3000 Coniskinnes
to the Duke for a present. It is now divided between^ the Venec^ans who keep
the greatest part, and the Tu^ke. 2 CROATIA or Corvatia, was called by the
ancients Li^urnia and Valeria: it has on the East and South Dalmatia, on the
North Savus; on the West Istria and Carniola. The chief Towns are Gradiska
situate on Savus. 2 Bruman. 3 Nouigrod situate on the Savus also, hard upon
Germany. and 4 Sisseghk, famous for the resis^ance which the Tu^kes found
there, Anno 1592. For the Turk^s hoping if they could conquer this little
Country, to have an open passage into Germany; entered it with a great army,
surprised the Castle of Ostrow^tz seated on the river Wana; took by seige the
strong Town of Wihits, a principal Town also of this Country, and seated on
the same river: which done they matched up to Sisseghk or Sissaken, where after
a long seige, they were raised by a power of Germans, that came to succor the
Town, who slew about 8000 of the Turks; most of the ^est being drowned in
the river Savus, as they ^ledd from the sword of the conqueror. The 6* and last
Town of note in this country is Petrowya, situate at the foot of the mountains,
which are between the rivers Savus and Dravus; and divide Hungary from
Sc^avonia. The Croatians are generally, though corruptly called Corbats. Their
Country has the title of a Dukedom, and is subject partly to the Austrians,
and partly to the Venetians, who set first footing in it, Anno 1007.

OF GREECE.
Maginus.
GREECE, the Mother of Arts and Sciences, is bounded on the East with the Aegean
sea, the Hellespont, Propontis, and Thracius Bosphorus: on the West where it
beholds her daughter and supplanter, Italy; with the Adriatique sea: on the
North with the mountain Hamus, of which Stratonicus used to say, that for
eight months it was very cold, and for the other four, winter: and on the
South with the Ionian Sea.

It was called Greece from Graecus the son of Cecrops, first founder of
Athens; and at the first was only attributed for the Country about Attica: but
after the Macedonian Empire had swallowed all the petty Commonwealths, this
name was communicated to the whole Country; whose people by a Synecdoche are
diversely called, by some Achiui, by some Mirmidones, sometimes Pelasgi, Danai,
Argini, etc.

This Country is situate in the Northern temperate Zone, under the fifth and
sixth Climats, the longest day being 15 hours.

The people were once brave men of war, sound Scholars, addicted to the love
of virtue, Sands.
and civil of behavior. A nation once so excellent, that their precepts and
examples do still remain, as approved rules and Tutors to instruct and direct
the man, that indeauoreth to be vertuo^s: famous for government; affectours of
freedom, every way noble. For which virtues in themselves, and want of them in
others, all their neighbor and remote nations, were by them scornefully called
Barbarians: a name now most fit for the Grecians themselves, being an
vnco^stant people, destitute of all learning, and the means to obtain it,
Universities: uncivil, riotous, and so lazy, that for the most part they
endeavor their profit no farther then their belly compells them. When they
meet at feasts or bankets, they drink small draughts at the beginning; which
by degrees they increase, till they come to the height of intemperancy: at
which point when they are arrived, they keep no rule or order; whereas before,
to drink out of ones turn is accounted a point of incivility. Hence, as I
believe, sprung our byword, As merry as a Greek, and the Latin word Graecari.

The women are for the most part brown complexioned, exceedingly welfauoured,
and excessiuely amorous. Painting they use very much, to keep themselves in
grace with their husbands: for when they once grow wrinkled, they are put to all the drudgeries of the house.

The Christian faith was received here immediately after the passion of the
Lamb slain, from the beginning of the world: but especially established by
Timoth^e, to whom S. Paul writ two Epistles. The Fathers whom in this Church
they most adhere unto, and reverence, are Chrysostom, Basil, and the two
Gregory's, the one surnamed Nissene, and the other Nazianzen. The Church
government is by the 4 Patriarchs; of Alexandria, who presideth over Egypt and
Arabia: Brerewo^d*
of Jerusalem, who governs the Greeks of Palestine: of Antioch, whose
jurisdiction contains Syria, Armenia, and Cilicia: and of Constantinople, to
whose charge are committed all the other Provinces of the Greek Church, as all
Greece and Muscovie: Sclavonia, Dacia, and part of Poland; all the Islands of
the Adria ique and Aegean Seas, together with Crete, Cyp^us, and Rho^es; almost
all Natolia, and the Sea shores of Pontus Euxinus, and Palus Maeotis. Their
Liturgy is ordinarily that of S. Chrysostom; but on festival days that of
S. Basil: which being both written in the learned or ancient Greek, does not
much more edify the vulgar people then the Latin Service does the illiterate
Papists. The particular tenets by which the Gre^ke Church does differ from the
Roman and Reformed are already specified in our description of Muscovie:
between which two of Greece and Muscouy the most material points are the
manner of distributing the Sacrament; and the exacting of marriage at the
Ordination of Priests.

The language they spoke was the Greek, of which were five Dialects, 1
Atticke. 2 Doricke. 3 Aeolicke. 4 Ionicke. and 5 The Common Dialect, or phrase
of speech. A language excellent for Philosophy and the liberal arts, but more
excellent for so great a part of the means of our salvation delivered therein:
for the lofty sound, significant expressions of the mind, genuine suauity and
happy composition of diverse words in one, so excellent above others; that even
in the flourishing of the Roman Commonwealth, it ouertopped the Latin;
insomuch that most of the histories of Rome were writ in this tongue, as
Polybius, Dion Cassius, Appian, and the like. It also was once of wonderful
extent, in Greece, Natolia, Italy, Province, and almost all the Islands of the
Mediterranean. But now partly through mutilation of some words, and compaction
of others; partly by the confusion of the true sound of vowells, dipthongs, and
consonants; and the translating of the Accents; to which may be added the
commixtion of the language of foreign nations: the language is not only fallen
from its elegancy, but also from its largeness of extent; as being confined
within Greece, and there not only much corrupted, but almost quite devoured by
the Sclavonian, and Turkish tongues.

The soil questionless is very fruitful, and would yield great profit to the
husbandman, if they would take pains in the tilling: but they knowing nothing
certainly to be their own, but all things subject to the Grand Signeur and his
Soldiers, omit agriculture, and may perchance think of that of the Poet,
Impius haec tam culta noualia miles habebi^?
Barbarus has segetes? en queis consuevimu arua.
Shall misbeleeuing Turks these acros spoil,
Which I manured with so much cost and toil?
Shall they enjoy my care? See neighbors see,
For whom these goodly cornfields tilled be.
The more natural and certa^ne commodities which they transport into other
parts, are Wines; which in memory of the water which our Savior turned into
wine, and on that day whereon they think this miracle was wrought; they use to
baptize: for which cause the Jews will drink none of them. They send also
into other parts of the world, Oil, Copper, Vittriall, some Gold and Silver,
Veluets, Damasks, Turquesse Grograms, etc.

This Country has formerly been famous for the Captains Miltiades,
Epaminondas, Aristides, Pyrrhus, and (to omit infinite others) Alexander the
subverter of the Persian Monarchy: For the divine Philosophers, Plato,
Socrates, A^istotle, and Theophraslus; for the most exquisite Poets, Hesiodus,
Homerus, Sophocles, and Aristophanes. For the faithful Historiographers,
Xenophon the condisciple of Plato, Thucydides, Plu^arch, and Herodotus: The
eloquent Orators Aeschines, Demosthenes, and Isocrates. And lastly, the
authors and establishers of all humane learning whatsoever, only the
Mathematiques excepted.

The chief rivers are C^phisus, which arising in the Frontires of Epirus,
disburdeneth it self into the Aegean Sea. 2 Erigon. and 3 Alaicmon; which
beginning their course in the more northern parts of Macedon, end it in
Thirmaicus sinus. 4 Strim^n in Migdonia. 5 Athicus and Nisus in Thrace. 6
S^ymphalus, where Hercules killed the Stymphalian birds; and 7 Ladon in
Arcadia. 8 Inachus whose daughter Io turned into a Heifer, was worshipped by
the Egyptians under the name of Isis. And 9 Pineus, whose daughter was Daphne,
turned into a bay tree; in Macedon: as also Populifer. 10 Sperchius, and
irrequietus, 11 Enipeus;
12 Apidanusque senex; lenisque 13 Amphrisus; and 14 Aeas.
Poplar-clad Sperchius, swift Enipeus, old
Apidane, smooth Amphrisus, Aeas cold.


Thus much of the whole Country in gross; the chief and ordinary division is,
into 1 Pel. ponnesus. 2 Achaia. 3 Epirus. 4 Albania. 5 Macedonia. 6 Migdonia. 7
Thracia.

1 PELOPONNESVS.
Maginus.
PELOPONNESVS is a peninsula rounded with the Sea, except where it is tied to
the maine land of Greece, by an Istmus of 5 miles in breadth; which the
Grecians and Venetians fortified with a strong wall, and 5 Castles. This was
called Hexamilium, and was overthrown by Amurath the second, who harassed and
spoiled all the Country. It was afterward in the year 1453, upon a rumor of
a new war, built up again by the Venetians (who then had the greatest part
of this Country) in 15 days: there being for that time 30000 men employed in
the work. This wall extended from one sea unto the other; which had it been
as warily guarded, as it was hastily built; or as it was well fortified, had it
been so well manned: might easily have resisted the Turks, until more means
had bin thought on to defend it.

Dio^.
This Istmus was begun to have been dug through by Nero, who to hearten on
his soldiers, loath to attempt so fruitless an enterprise; took a spade in
hand, and busily began the work. Yet at last the Soldiers, being frighted
with the blood which abundantly broke forth; with the groans and roarings
which they continually heard* and with the Hobgoblins and Furies, which were
always in their sight: persuaded the Emperor, now half out of the humor, to
leave this, and inioyne them some more profitable service. King Dem^tr^us, C.
Caligula, and I. Caesar, with like success attempted the same action.

This Peninsula is in compass 600 miles, and was called at the first Aegialia,
from Aegtalus the first King, A.M. 1574: 2 Apia from Apis the fourth King. 3
Siciona, from the ninth King Sicion; which name was afterward attributed to a
little Province by Corinth: then Peloponnesus from Pelops, and (...) insula,
and now Morea, a Maurorum incursionibus, as Mercator thinks.

This Country is divided into these six Provinces, 1 Elis. 2 Messenia. 3
Arcadia. 4 Laconia. 5 Argolis, and Achaia propria.

1 The Country of ELIS has on the East Aready, on the West the Ionian Sea,
Stephanus.
on the North Achaia propria, on the South Messe^ia. The chief cities are Elis,
which gives name to the whole Province. Nigh unto this city runs the river
Alpheus, of which you shall hear more in Sicilia; and in this City reigned the
King A^geus, the cleansing of whose Stable is accounted one of the wonders, or
twelve labors performed by Hercules. This Elis was of old called Olympia,
famous for the Statue of Jupiter Olympicus, one of the worlds 7 wonders, being
in height 60 cubits; composed by that excellent workman Phidias, of gold, and
ivory. In honor of this Jupiter were the Olympicke games instituted by Hercules
on the hill Olympus in Thessalie. The 2 d City is Pisa, whose people following
Nestor to the wars of Troy, in their return were by tempest driven to the
coasts of Italy; where they built the City Pisa.

2 MESSENIA has on the East Arcady, Adrianus.
on the North Elis, on the South and West the Sea. It takes its name from the
Metropolis Mesene on Sinus Messeniacus, now called Golfo di Coron. In this City
Menelaus was king, whose wife the fair Helena, was the cause of the
destruction of Troy. 2 Pilon, where Nestor was King, now called Navarino. 3
Methone or Medon. This people had once great sway in this Peninsula, for whose
sole Empire they were long corriuall with the Spartans: who at last getting the
upper hand of them, oppressed them with miserable slavery. Pezelius in Sleidan.
In the confines of this Country stood a Temple of Diana, common alike to the
Messenians, Spartans, and Doors. It happened that some Spartan Virgins were by
the Messenians here ravished; which abuse, the Spartans pretended to be the
ground of their war; the true reason indeed being, their covetousness of the
sole Empire. This war broke out 3 times. The first continued 20 years, in
which space the Lacedaemonians fearing their absence would hinder the supply of
young children in the city; sent a company of their ablest young men home, to
accompany their wives. Their offspring were called Parthenij, who coming to
full growth, abandoned Sparta, s^yled into Italy, and there built Tarentum. The
second being of 23 years continuance, was raised and maintained by
Aristomenes, one of the blood-royall. This war prospered, till Aristocrates
King of Arcadia, one of the confederates, revolted, to side with Lacedaemon.
Then began they to decline, and Aristomenes was thrice taken prisoner, still
miraculously escaping. His last imprisonment was in a dungeon, where by chance
espying a Fox devouring a dead body, he caught hold of her tail: The Fox
running a way, guided Aristomenes after; till the straitness of the hole by
which she went out, made him leave his holt, and fall to scraping with his
nails; which exercise he never left, till he had the hole passable, and so
escaped; and having a while vpheld his falling Country, died in Rhodes. The
third war was like drops after a tempest. In this the Messenians were forced
to abandon their Country; which they could never again recover, till
Epaminondas having vanquished the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra, restored them to
their ancient possessions.

3 ARCADIA has on the East Laconia, on the West Elis and Messene, on the North
Achaia propria, and on the South the Sea. This Country took its name from
Arcas, the son of Jupiter and Calisto; but was forme^ly called Pelasgia: the
people whereof thought themselves more ancient then the Moon. Ovid. de Fast.
Or^a prius Luna, de se fi creditur ipsi,
A magno tellus Arcade nomen habet.
The land which of great Arcas took its name*
Was ere the Moon, if we will credit Fame.
The chief Cities are 1 Psophis. 2 Mantinea, nigh unto which the Theban Army,
Pezel. in Sleidan.
consisting of 30000 foot, and 3000 horse; routed the Army of the Spartans and
Athenians, consisting of 25000 foot, and 2000 horse. In this battle
Epaminondas that famous Leader, received his deaths wound, and not long after
died. At his last gasp one of his friends said; Alas thou die Epaminondas,
and leauest behind thee no children: Nay, replied he, two daughters will I
leave behind me, the victory at Leuctra, and this other at Mantinea. 3.
Megalopolis, the birthplace of Polybius, that excellent Historian. 4 Phialia
toward the sea. Here was the lake Stymphalus, Maginus.
and the river Styx, whose water for the poisonous taste, was called the water
of hell. The Poets feign, that Gods used to swear by this river, as may be
euerywhere observed: and what God soever swore by Styx falsely, he was banished
from Heaven, and prohibited Nectar for a 1000 y^ares. It is a Country whose
fitnes for pastorage and grazing, has made it the subject of many worthy and
witty discourses, especially that of Sr Philip Sidney; of whom I cannot but
make honorable mention: a book which besides its excellent language, rare
contriuances, and delectable stories; has in it all the strains of Poesy,
comprehends the universal Art of speaking, and to them which can discern,
and will observe, affords notable rules for demeanor, both private and
public.

4 LACONIA has on the East and South the Sea, on the North Argolis, on the
West Arcadia. The chief Cities are Lacedaemon, once a famous Commonwealth,
Plutarch.
whose laws were compiled by Lycurgus; who going a journey, bound the people
by oath, to observe all his Laws till he returned: and being gone from thence,
commanded, that when he was dead and buried, his ashes should be cast into the
Sea, By this means, his Laws were kept in Sparta almost 700 years, during
which time the Commonwealth flourished in all prosperity. Whosoever is desirous
to know the particular laws, customs, and ordinances, by which this
Commonwealth did subsist; may in the life of Lycu^gus set down by Plutarch,
find them all specified. Their course of living was so strict and severe, that
many went to wars, hoping by death to rid themselves from life, so austere
and unpleasing. Laertius.
D^ogenes returning from Sparta to At^ens, said, that he returned from men to
women, (...): To another demand^ng in what part of Greece he saw the most
complete men; he replied, that he saw saw men nowhere, but boys at
Lacedaemon. This Commonwealth was so equally mixed, that the sovereignty of one
was nothing prejudicial to the liberty of all. Their kings being of the race
of Hercules, had a royalty not unlimited, the Nobles prerogat^ues not
infringed; the people, freedom unquestioned. The Ephori or Tribunes of the
people, whose authority was in some respect above the Kings, made it seem a
Democracie: The Senate whose decrees were uncontrollable, resembled an
Aristocracie: The Kings who like the soul did animate and actuate the rest,
showed that there was somewhat also of a Monarchy. A rare mixture of
government. The discipline of this city, both in war and peace, made it
feared by the neighbors as well as honored. Plutarch.
The people were accounted the chief of all the Grecians, and directed the
rest as subordinate to them. At last the Athenians having conquered many large
Provinces in Asia, began somewhat to Eclipse their glory; which they not
enduring, warred against Athens; and after many losses on their parts
sustained, took the city, and dismantled it. Immediately followed the war
betwixt them, and the Boeotians; the Athenians covertly, and the Persians
openly assisting the enemy. Here their prosperity began to leave them; for
beside many small defeates, Epaminondas the Theban so discomfited them, at the
overthrows of Leuctra and Mantinea; that Sparta it self was in danger of
utter ruin. Not long after happened the Holy-warre, wherein they also made a
party: but this war being ended by King Philip, they scarce breathed more
freedom, then he gave air to. But when Alexanders Captains fought for the
Empire of their master, all these flourishing Republickes were either totally
swallowed into, or much defaced by the Kingdom of Macedon. The Lacedaemonians
held the chief strength of a town to consist in the valor of the people; and
therefore would never suffer Sparta to be walled, till the times immediately
following the death of Alexander the Great: yet could not these Fortifications
defend them from Antigonus Doson King of Macedon; who having vanquished
Cleomenes King of Sparta, entered the town, and was the first man that ever was
received into it as Conqueror; so much different were the present Spartans
from the valor and courage of their ancestors. Here lived the famous Captains
Euribiades, the Admiral of the Navy against Xerxes, Lisander: and Agesilaeus.
The second City of note is Leuctra on the sea side. 3 Thalana, nigh unto which
is the Lake Lerna, where Hercules slew the monster Hydra, and the mount
Tenarus, from whence the same champion drew the three-headed Dog Cerberus, as
the Poets called him; and 4 Selassia, where Antigonus vanquished Cleomenes.

5 ARGOLIS, so called from the chief City Argos, is bounded on the East and
North with the Sea, on the West with Achaiae propria, on the South with
Laconia. The chief Cities are Argos, built by Argus the fourth king of this
Country. The first king was Inachu^, A.M. 2109. The last Achrisius, whose
daughter Danae, being shut up in a Tower of brass, was yet ravished by Jupiter
to whom she bare Perseus. This Perseus having by mishap slain Achrisius,
translated the Kingdom of Argos, to Micene the second City of note. From this
Perseus descended Atreus and Thiestes; from Atreus, Agamemnon; who was Captain
of the Greekish Army before Troy, in which were 69 Kings, wasted over with a
Navy of 1224 ships. The third Town is Nemaea, S^ W.R.
where Hercules slew the Lions. In honor of this memorable exploit, were
instituted the Nemaean games, which continued famous in Greece for many ages.
The exercises were running with swift horses, whorlebats, running on foot,
quotting, wrestling, darting, shoo^ing. Some refer the beginning of these
games to the honor of one Opheltus a Lacedaemonian: and others fetch it
higher, from the wars of Thebes: but this I take to be the more probable
opinion. 4 Epidaurus, famous for the Temple of Aesculap^us: and 5 Nauplia,
where Naulu^ the Father of Palamedes was king.

6 ACHAIA PROPRIA, has on the South Elis, Arcadia, and Argolis: and on all
other parts, the s^a. The chief Cities are 1 Corinthians, eated at the foot of the
Acro-Corinthian hills, hard by the Fount^ine Pirene* called by Perseus, fons
Caballinus, because it was by the Poets fained to have bin made by the horse
Pegasus, dashing his hoof against the rock. This town was fenced with a
castle, which stand^ng on the Acro-Corinthian hills, was called Acro-Corinthus.
It was for strength impregnable, and for command very power^ull; as able to cut
off all passage by land, from one half of Greece to the other: and mastering
the Ionian and Aegaean seas: upon both which, Corinth had such commodious
havens, the sea on both sides washing the walls, that Horace calls it,
Corinthus bimaris. It was built by Corinthus the son of Pelops, from whom it
took name; and by reason of her commodious situation, so exceedingly thriued
and flourished, that in the heat of their pride the Cori^thians abused certain
Roman Ambassadors, sent unto them. But irasci populo Romano nemo sapienter
potest, as Livy says, and this the Corinthians found to be true: for Lucius
Mummius took the town, and burnt it to the very ground. It was afterward
re-edified, and is now a place of small note, called by the Turks Crato Here
lived the famous whore Lais, which exacted 10000 Drams for a nights
lodging, which made Demosthenes cry, non emam ^anti penitere, and occasioned
the old verse, Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum.
It Is not for every man's avail,
Unto Corinth for to ^aile.
Here also Theseus instituted the Istmian games, in the honor of N^ptune, as
Hercules had the Olympian in honor of Jupiter. 2 Patras. 3 Sycion, now
Vasilico. 4 Dimeae.

These Commonwealths flourished in Peloponnesus, till the civil wars betwee^
Sparta, Thebes, and Athens; which so weakened all sides, that they were soon
made a prey to Philip of Macedon. After they we^e subject to the Roman, then to
the Constantinopolitan Emperors; and when the Latins subdued Constantinople,
Turk. hist.
most of this Country fell into the arms of Venice: whose people fortified i^
in many pl^ces, especially toward the Sea: finally, it was conquered by the
Turks, 1460.

2 ACHAIA.
ACHAIA, called once H^llas, from Helles, son to Deu^alion, is bounded on the
East with the Aegaean Sea, on the West with Epirus, on the North wi^h Thessaly,
on the South with Peloponnes^^, and the Seas thereof. It is diuid^d into 1
Attica 2 Megaris 3 B^^v^a: 4 Phoci^. 5 Aetol^a. 6 Dori^. 7 Locris.

Strabo.
1 A^TICA has on the West Megaris; on the other part^ the Sea. The soil is
v^ry barren and cr^ggi^; yet the art^ficiall endea^our of the people,
wonderfully enriched them; s^ that the yea^ely revenues of the Commonwealth
were ^200 Talent^. The money current in this Country was commonly stamped with
an Ox; whence came the byword against bribing and corrupt Lawyers, Bos in
lingua. Not much unlike to this was the Proverb, ^ising from the money of
Aegina, being stamped with a snaile; which was, virtutem and sapientiam vincunt
testudines.

The chief city Athens (now Selines) was built by Cecrops the first King
hereof, and called Cecrop^^, Ao Mundi ^409. It was after repaired by Th^seus,
and furnished with good Laws by Solon. It took name from Minerva (whom the
Grecians call Athenae) in whose honor there were long time solemn plays,
called Panathena^a. This City has bin ^amous for many things, three
especially, first for the ^nviolable faith of the Citizens in their leagues,
and unfeigned affection to their friends; so that Fides Attica grew into Adage.
Second^y, for the famous Scholars which here taught and flourished: And indeed
so happy a nurserie was it of good wits, and so fitly seated for study, that
the very natives being in other Countries, could sensibly perceive some want of
that natural vigor, which usually was resident in their spirits. Ita ut
corpora istius gentis separata sint in ali^s reg^ones; Velleius.
ingenia vero solis Atheniensium muris clausa es^e ex^st^^nes. It was a famous
University, from whose great e^^erne, the conduit-pipes of Learning were
dispersed over all Europe. Yet at the first the sweet strains of Apollo's
harp, did not out-sound the loud braying of Mars his Trumpet: this City
yielding more valiant Captains, then any in the world, Rom^ excepted, which
was the third thing which raised the reputation of the City. Plutarch.
Alcibiad^s, Aristides, Themist^cl^s, Pericle^, with diverse others, were the
men that vpheld and enlarged the Athenian Republicke: yet were the people so
ungrateful to them, or they so vn^o^tun^te in the end, that they ^ll died
either (...) banishm^nt or violently at home. Th^mistocles the cha^pion of
^reec^, died an exile in Pe^sia. ^hoc^on was slain by the (...) laid violent
hands on himself; Pericl^s (...) endangered; and Theseus the founder of the
Ci(...) from hi^ royalty, and spitefully imprisoned. Aristi(...), and others,
banished ten years by the Ostracisme. This form of punishment, so called,
because the nam^ of the party banished was writ in an Oyster shell, was only
used toward such, who either began to grow too popular, or potent among the men
of service Which device allowable in a Democracie, where the overmuch
powerablenes of one, might hazard the liberty of all, was exercised on spite
oftener, then desert. A Country-fellow meeting by chance Aristides, desired him
to write Aristides in his shell; and being asked, whether the man whose
banishment he desired, had ever wronged him, replied, No, he was only sorry to
hear folks call him a good man. We find the like unfortunate end to most of
the Romans, so redoubted in war: Coriolanus was exiled; Camillus confined to
Ardea; Scipio murdered, with diverse others, only because their virtue had
lifted them above the pitch of ordinary men. Ventidius was disgraced by
Antonie: Agricola poisoned with the priuity of Domitian: Corbulo murdered by the
command of Nero: all able men yet living in an age, wherein it was not law^ull
to be valiant. In later times it so happened to Gonsalvo the Great Captain, who
having conquered the kingdom of Naples, drove the French beyond the
mountains, and brought all the Italian Potentates to stand at the Spaniards
devotion; was by his master called home, where he died obscurely, and was
buried without solemnity, without tears. Worse fared the Guise and Byron in
France; worse Essex, and Dudley of Northumberland with us; neither will I omit
William Duke of Suffolk, who having served 34 years in our French wars, and
for 17 years together, never returning home, was at his return, basely made
away. It were almost impiety to be silent of Ioab, the brauest soldier, and
politickest Leader, that ever fought the Lords battles; yet he died at the
horns of the Altar. Whether it be that such men are borne under an unhappy
Planet; or that Courtiers, and such as have b^st opportunity to endeere men of
war with their Sovereigns, know not how to commend and extol their deserts,
in a subject beyond the reach of their bra^ne, or courage of their heart; or
that faction and opposition at home; or Envy that common foe to Virtue, be the
hinderance, I cannot determine. Yet it may be that Princes naturally distrust
men of employment, and are loath to add honors to a working wit, and an
attempting spirit: and it may be the fault of Soldiers themselves, by an
unseasonable praise of their own worths, above the ability of renumeration in
that state. This was the cause of Silius death under Tiberius, concerning
which, the Historian gives us this excellent sentence: Beneficia eo usque lata
sunt, dum videntur exsolui posse: ubi multum anteven^re, pro gratia odium
redditur.

The last King hereof was Codrus, Patercul.
who in the wars against the Peloponnesians, having intelligence by an
oracle, that his enemies should have the victory, if they did not kill the
Athenian King; attired himself like a beggar, and forced the Peloponnesians to
kill him: and they understanding how unfortunately they had slain him, whom
they had most desire to have saved, raised their camp and departed. For this
fact, the Athenians so honored his memory, that they thought no man worthy to
succeed him as King; and therefore committed the managing of the state to
Governors for term of life, whom they called Archontes, Freigi^
the first Archon being Medon the son of C^drus. This government began A.M.
2897, and continued 316 years, at which time the Archontes were appointed to
govern ten years only, and then to give up their charge: Seventy years
lasted this government under seven Archentes, which time expired A.M. 3284,
began the Democracie of Athens; during which, Draco and Solon the Law-giuers
flourished. Toward the ^^ter end of Solons life, Pisistratus altered the free
state, and made himself Lord or Tyrant of the City: but he once dead, the
people regained their freedom, driving thence Hippias the son of Pisistratus,
who hereupon fled for succor to Darius K. of Persia, by this means bringing
the Persians first into Greece. What success the Persians had in Greece, the
Histories of these times abundantly inform us. Darius being vanquished by
Miltiades at Marathron; and Xerxes by Themistocles at Salamis: yet did not
Athens escape so clear, but that it was taken by Xerxes, Plutarch.
though indeed first abandoned, and voluntarily dismanteled by the Athenians.
When the Persians were retired homewards, the people of Athens reedified their
town, and strongly fortified it with high and defensible walls; which done,
they put their Fleet to sea, and spoiled the coasts of Persia in all quarters;
enriching their city with the spoils, and enlarging their power and dominion,
by the addition of many Islands and sea-townes. Hereby they grew unto that
wealth and potencie, that they were suspected by their weaker neighbors,
Thucydides.
and envied by their stronger, the Lacedaemonians especially: who fearing to
loose their ancient prioritie over Greece; but pretending the surprifall of
Potidea a City of Thrace from the Corinthians, and some hand measure by them
showed upon the Megarenses, made war upon them. In the beginning of this
war the Athenians not only resisted the whole powers of all Greece
confederate against them; but so exceedingly prospered, that the Spartans sued
for peace, and could not get it. But the scales of Fortune turned; for after
they had held out 28 years, they were compelled to pluck down the walls of
their town, and submit themselves to the order of the Lacedaemonians, now by
the puissance of Lysander victorious. Then was this Virgin-Town prostituted to
the lust of 30 Tyrants, whom not long after, Thrasibulus a brave soldier, and
one that loved the liberty of his Country, expelled. This war was called
Bellum Peleponnesiacum. Not long after, the Persians seeing how the State of
Sparta, for want of the opposition of Athens, began to work upon their Empire;
furnished Conon a worthy Gentleman of Athens, with a Navy so well furnished,
that therewith he vanquished the Lacedaemonian Fleet; and put the Athenians by
this victory in so good heart, that they once more reedified their walls.
Immediately after followed the war against Thebes, Plutarch.
called Bellum sacrum, which in the end was composed by Philip of Macedon, by
bringing as well the Thebans whom he came to succor, as the Athenians,
Spartans, and Phocians, whom he came to oppose, all under his own dominion:
from which slavery, Greece never recovered, till as well Macedon, as she,
became follow-seruants to Rome.

The next towns of note in Attica, were 1 Marathron, where Miltiades
discomfited the numerous Army of Darius, consisting of 100000 foot, and 10000
horse, the emulation of which noble victory, startled such brave resolves in
the breast of Themistocles. 3 Piraea the hauen-town to Athens, built and
impregnably fortified by the advice of Themistocles, and afterward the better
to keep under the Athenians, demolished by Scylla, in his wars against
Mythridates. 4 Panormus.

2 MEGARIS has on the East Attica, on the West Sinus Corinthiacus, on the
North Boeotia, and on the South the Isimus. The chief city is Megara, now
Megra, where Euclide taught Geometry. Ovid makes mention of one Nisus King of
this Country, not so happy that his head was circled with a Coronet, as that
thereon grew a purple hair; to which was annexed the preservation both of his
life and Kingdom. This Jewel his daughter Scylla delivered to King Minos, her
Fathers enemy: who joyfully receiving the present, commanded her to be cast
into the Sea; where she was (as some write) turned to the gulf so named. I
leave the moralizing of the Fable, to such as prosesse Mythologie; observing
only by the way, the antiquity of that politic practice, to love the Treason,
and hate the Traitors. This Country after shaking off the Cretans, became sui
iuris; and amounted to that height of prosperity, that they contended with the
Athenians for the Island of Salamis, and so crushed them in one fatal
overthrow, that a Law was enacted in Athens, that whosoever mentioned the
recovery of Salamis, should loose his life: so that Solon was compelled to fain
himself mad, the safelier to motion the matter, which had a prosperous end.
This fortune of the Megarenses lasted not long in so eminent a degree; yet they
continued a free people, till the coming of the Macedonians. The second town
of note in Megaris is Eleusis, where Ceres had a Temple, which is hence
called Ceres Eleusina.

3 BOEOTIA has on the East Attica, on the West Phocis, on the North the river
Cephisus, on the South Megaris and the Sea. It took its name from B^s, which
signifies an Ox: for when Cadmus weary with seeking his sister Eur^pa,
whom Jupiter had stolen from Phoenicia, came to Delphos; he was warned by
the Oracle, to follovv the first young Ox he savv, and where he rested, to
build a City; the Country for this cause was called Boeotia. Plutarch.
It was a custom in this Country to burn before the door of the house in
which a new-married wife was to dwell, the axle-tree of the coach in which she
came thither: Giving her by this ceremony to understand, that she must
restrain her self from gadding abroad; and that being now joined to an
husband, she must frame her self to live and tarry with him, without any hope
of departure.

The chief city is Thebes, built on the brook Cephisus, by Cadmus the
Phoenician. Famous it is for the wars here made of old between Eteocles and
Polinices, sons to that unfortunate Prince Oedipus, and his mother and wife
Iocasta. The History of this war is the most ancient piece of story which we
find of all Greece; the former times and writings containing nothing but
Fables, little sauouring of humanity, and less of truth: As of well changed
into Monsters, the adulteries of the gods, and the like. In this town l^ued
Pelopidas, and Epaminondas, who so crushed the Lacedaemonians at the battles of
Leuctres and Mantinea; Plutarch.
that they could never after re-obtaine their former puissance. This
Commonwealth long flourished, and at last being ouerburdened in the Phocian
war, was glad to submit it self to the mercy of the Macedonians, under the
leading of King Philip: who by this means first got footing in Greece, into
which afterward he thrust his whole body. Upon the death of Philip, Thebes
revolted from the Macedons; but Alexander his successor quickly recovered it;
and to dishearten the Greeks in the like attempts, he razed the city, selling
all the inhabitants of age and strength: only Pindarus house he commanded to be
left standing, in honor of that learned Poet. At the sack of this town, one of
the Macedon soldiers entered the house of a principal woman, named Timoclea,
ravished her, and rifled her coffers: but still demanding more treasure, she
showed him a deep Well, saying that there all her money was hidden. The
credulous villain stooping down to behold his prey, she tumbled into the Well,
and ouer-whelmed with stones; for which noble act, the generous Captain highly
commended, and dismissed her unhurt. The City was re-edified by Cassander, and
is now called Scibes. 2 Daulis, which was under the subjection of Tereus King
of Thrace, who having ravished Philomela, daughter to Pandion, King of the
Athenians, was by his wife Progne, sister to Philomela, murdered, after he had
eaten his son Itys in a Pie. 3 Platea, in which Mardonius the General of the
Persians, was overcome by the Grecians. Pezel. in Sleidan.
There were slain in this battle, Mardonius himself, and 260000 Persians; but
on the side of the Grecians, 31 Lacedaemonians, 52 Athenians, 16 Arcadians; and
of the Megarenses about 600. The Lieftenant-Generall was Pausanias, who
afterward plotting to make himself the Tyrant of all Greece, and being
discovered, fled into the Temple of Pallas. In this place it was almost a
sacrilege to meddle with him; and therefore they resolved to close up the
door, his mother voluntarily laying the first stone. Before this battle, the
Athenians had an Oracle, that they should be conquerours, if they fought in
their own territories; whereupon the Plateans, within whose jurisdiction the
battle was fought, gave that part of their Country to the City of Athens: In
requital of which worthy donation, Alexander the great re-edified and enlarged
their city. 4 Leuctra, where the Thebans under the conduct of Epaminoudas,
vanquished the Lacedamonians, slew their King Cleombrotus; and not only
preserved their own liberty, but brought their enemies to that fall of courage
and reputation, that they could hardly ever rise again. 5 Asc ra, the
birthplace of Hesiod, a man (according to Paterculus) elegantis ingenij, and
carminum dulcedine memorabilis: though the proud Critic Scaliger, intending to
deifie Virgil, most iniudiciously and absurdly prefers the worse Verse in
the Georgickes of the one, before the whole works of the other. 6 Cheronea or
Coronea, the birthplace of Plutarch. Plutarch.
Near unto this City was fought that memorable battle between L. Sylla, and
the Romans, against Archelaus Lieutenant to Mithridates King of Ponius, who led
an Army of 120800 Soldiers: of which great number only 10000 escaped with
life; Sylla loosing of his own men 14 only. 7 Orchomenon, nigh unto which the
same Sylla vanquished Dorilaus, an other of the Kings captaine^, having an Army
of 80000 men, whereof 20000 lost their lives. After these two victories Sylla
made peace with Mithridates, because Marius and Cinna domineering in Rome, had
trodden his faction underfoot: herein preferring his own quarrels, before the
ruin of the common enemy; which had he followed these victories, ne^^^er could
have raised an other war, as he did afterward*

In this Country are the streights of Thermopylae, which in the war that
Xerxes made against Gre^ce, were defended by 300 Spartans, and their King
Leonidas: Who having valiantly resisted that Army, which in their passage out
of Persia, had d^ankedly whole rivers, and s^^m of them 20000, died all in the
place. Xerxes, lest the greatness of his loss should terrify his men, who had
not yet seen that unproportionable discomfiture; buried in several pits, all
save one thousand; as if no more had bin wanting then they.

4 PHOCIS is bounded on the East with Boeotia, on the West with Locris and
Doris, on the North with the river Cephisus, and on the South with the Sinus
Corinthi^cus. In this Country is Helicon the mount consecrated to the Muses; as
also another hill of this Country, called Cithaeron, and both striving with
Parnassus in height and bigness. This Pernassus is of wonderful height, whose
two tops even kiss the clouds: Ovid. Met.

With his two tops does kiss the Stars so bright.
In the general deluge of Greece, in which almost all men perished in the
waters, Deucalion and Pyrrha, saved themselves on this h^ll; not far from
which stood the Temple of Themis.

The chief Towns are Cyrra, 2 Crissa; 3 and Antycira on the Sea; the last of
which is famous for the Elleborum that grew there, a Herb very medicinal for
the Phren^ie, whence came the proverb. naviget Antyciram 4 Elladia. 5 Pytho or
Pythia, a town seated not only in the midst of Greece, but of the whole World
also. For Jupiter desirous once to know the ex^ct middle of the Earth, let the

this place, showed plainly that here was the navel or mid part of the Earth.
This town by reason of its convenient situation, was the Sessions town of all
Greece, it being the meeting place of the Amphictyones. These Amphictyones were
men selected out of the 12 pri^^ cities of Greece: they had power to decide
all contro^ersies and enact Laws for the common good. They were instituted
either by Acrisius (as Strabo) or (as Halicarnas^an thinks) by Amphi^^yon the
son of Helen, Stephanus.
from whom they seem to have derived their name. Their meetings were at the
beginnings of the Spring and Autumn: The Commissioners o^ the Cities were in
several called Pylagorae. Some instances concerning their authority were not
amiss. In the time of Cimon, the Scyrians having by Piracie vvronged the
Thessalonians, were fined by this Council. Afterward the Lacedaemonians for
surprising Cadmea, and the Phocians, Pezel. in Sleidan.
for ploughing up the land of Cyrrha belonging to Delphos, were by them
amerced: and because they continued obstinate, and paid not their mu^ct, their
dominions were adjudged to be confiscate to the Temple of Apollo. But they
resisting this decree, spoiled the Temple it self; for which war being
proclaimed, and the rebels (for so they were now held) by the assistance of
Philip of Macedon subdued: the Council was again assembled. Here it was decreed
that the Phocians should raze their walls: that they should pay the yearly
tribute of sixty talents: that they should no more keep horse and armor, till
they had satisfied the Treasury of the temple: and that they should no more
have any voices in that consistory. It was also then enacted, that King Philip
and all his sucessours should have the two suffrages of the ^hocians in that
Parliament, and be (as it were) Princes of the Senate. To this general
Counsel in the Jewish Commonwealth, the Sanhed^in, or Aristocraticall
government of the 70 Elders, had most resemblance. At this time the Diots of
the Empire, the States of the Low-co^ntries, and the assemblies of the Swi^ze^s
and Grisons, come ^ighest to this pattern. 6 Delphos, where was the Temple of
Apollo; in which, with that of Jupiter Hannon in Cyrene, were the most famous
Oracles of the Heathens, delivered, dark riddles of the Devil, couched in a
form so cunningly contrived, that the truth was then farthest off, when it was
thought to have bin found. Craesus consulting with the Oracle, was given this
answer, Craesus Halyn penetrans m^gnam perve^tet opum vin^^*
When Craesus over H^ly^ row^th*
A mighty nation he overthrows.
Which he interpreting according to his own hopes; crossed the river, was
vanquished by Cy^us King of Persia and his wh^^e country ru^^ed. In the like
kind of deceitfu^l manner were the rest of the Oracles in those days given;
the devil being sure, that howsoever the event was* he would hardly be
convinced of lying. So we find King Pyrrhus before h^s war with the Romans,
to have consulted with the Oracle, and to have received this answer. Aio te
Aeacide Romanos vincere posse;
Which doubtful prediction he construing ^eposse vincere Romanos, according to
his own hopes, found afterward that the Devil meant Romanos posse vincere te,
that the Romans should overcome him; for so indeed it happened. By an other kind
of the same fallacy, which the Logicians call Amph^bolia, did the same enemy
of mankind overthrow an other Prince, who demanding of the Oracle what
success he should have in his wars had this answer given him, Ibis redibis
nunquam per bella peribis; which he thus commaing* Ibis, redibis, nunquam per
etc. ventured on the war, and was slain; whereupon his followers again
canvasing the Oracle, found that it was Ibis, redibis nunquam, per etc. The
like iuggling he also used in those supernatural dreams, which Philosophers
call (...), (or sent from the devil:) for Caesar dreaming that he committed
Incest with his mother, made himself Lord of Rome, which was his Country and
mother; and Hippias the son to P^isistratus the Tyrant of Athens, having upon
the same proiects the same dream, was killed, and buried in the bowels of his
mother the Earth; so that had Caesar miscarried in his action, and Hippias
thriued: yet still had the devil bin reputed his craftesmaster, and the father
of truths. But as the Ecclesiastical history tells us, that Julian the
Apostata consulting with the devil, was told that he could receive no answer,
because that the body of Babilas the martyr, was entombed nigh his Temple; so
much rather could the devils deceive the World, as formerly they had done,
after Christ the Truth it self was manif^sted in the flesh, and tormented
these unclean spirits, though as they alle^dged before their time. For Augustus
in whose time our S^uiour was borne, consulting with the Oracle about his
successor* received this not-s^tisfying answer: (...),
(...);
(...) --
An Hebrew ch^ld, whom the blessed gods adore,
Has bid me leave these shrines and pack to hell,
So that o^ Oracles I can no more:
In silence leave our Altar, and farewell.
Whereupon Augustus coming home, in the Capitol erected an Altar, and thereon
in Capital letters caused this Inscription to be ingra^en, HAEC EST ARA
PRIMOGENITI DEI. Now as the devils had by Christ's birth lost much of their
wonted virtue, so after his passion they lost it almost altogether: concerning
which, Plutarch in a tract of his Moralls called (...), why Oracles cease ^o
give answers, tells us a notable story, which was this. Some company going
out of Greece into Italy, were about the Echinades becalmed, when on the sudden
there was heard a voice loudly calling on one Thamus an Egyptian, then in the
Ship. At the two first calls he made no answer, but to the third he replied,
Here I am: and the voice again spoke unto him, bidding him when he came to
Palodes* to make it known that the great god Pan was dead. When they came unto
the Palodes, which are certain shelue^ and rocks in the Ionian sea, Thamus
standing on the poope of the Ship, did as the voice directed him, whereupon
there was heard a mighty noise of many together, who all seemed to groan and
lament, with terrible and hideous skreiking. T^berius hearing of this miracle,
caused the learned of his Empire to search out who that Pan should be, who
returned answer, that he was the son of Mercury by Penelope; but such as more
narrowly observed circumstances, found it to happen just at the time when the
Lord of Life suffered death on the Cross, who was the true Pan and Shepherd
of our Souls; and that upon this divulging of his passion, the devils who used
to deliver Oracles, with great grief and lamentations forsook the office, which
had bin so profitable to them in seducing the blind people. I dare not affirm
that all Oracles then failed, but certainly they then began to decay: for
Iuvenal in his time affirmed, that Delphis oracula c^ssant. Plutarch.
This temple of Apollo being spoiled by the Phocians, caused the war between
them and the Thebans, called the Holy war, in which the Thebans being likely
to have the worst, sent for Philip of Macedon, who made an end of the war by
subduing them both. The spoil which the Ph^cians got out of the Temple, was 60
Tons of Gold, which was to them Aurum Tholosanum: so unpardonable a crime is
sacrilege, that the fault of some few, patronized by their confederats,
brings an incurable punishment on whole Nations.

5 LOCRIS is bounded on the West with Aetolia; on the North with Doris, on
other parts with the Sea. The chief cities are 1 Naup^ctum, now called Lepanto,
which once belonged to the Venetians, but now to the Turks. This Town the
Athenians gave unto the poor M^ssenians, when after their third war, Pezel.

6 AETOLIA has on the East Locris, on the West Epirus, on the North Doris, on
the South the Gul^e o^ Lepanto. Here is the Forest Calidon, where Meleager,
and the flower of the Greek Nobility, slew the wild Boar. Here is the river
Evenus, over which the Centau^e N^ssus having carried De^ane^ra, w^^e to
Hercules* and intending to have ravished her, was slain by an arrow, which
Hercules on the other side of the river shot at him. Here also is the river
Achel^us, of whom the Poets fable many things, Ovid.
as that being ^iuall with Hercules (iure it must needs be before he was
turned into a river;) in the love of Detaneira, he encount^ed him in the shape
of a Bull; and that when Hercules had plucked off one of hi^ horns, the Nymphs
made of it their so much celebrated Cornuc^pia. The people of this Country were
the most turbulent and unruly people of all Greece, never at peace with their
neighbors, and seldom with themselves. The Macedonians could never tame them,
by reason of the cragginesse of the Country: yet they brought them to such
terms, that they were compelled to let the Romans into Greece, who quickly
made an end of all. The chief towns are 1 Chalcis, 2 Olenus, 3 Pleurona, 4
Thermum, the parliament City of all Aetolia.

7 DORIS has on the East Boeotia, on the West Epirus, on the South the Sea;
and on the North the hill Oeta, on which Hercules being tortured by a poisoned
shirt, sent him by his innocent wise Deianeira, burned himself. The chief
cities are 1 Amphissa. The people of this City refusing to yield to the
sentence of the Amphictyones, against their confederats the Phoc^ans, were the
cause of Philips return into Greece: who grievously infested the territory of
the Boeotians. Plutarch.
Against these proceedings the Athenians opposed themselves; not so much in any
hope of prevailing, as being whetted on by the eloquence of D^mosthenes; whose
biting Orations against Philip called the Philipp^cks, have given name to all
the invectiues of this kind; so that Tullie called the Orations he composed
against Antonie his Philippica. At Coronea the armies meet where the Athenians
are vanquished; and Philip is made Captain of all Greece. 2 Libra and 3 C^^^um.

The whole Country of Achaia was subdued by Amurath the second.

3 EPIRVS.
EPIRVS has on the East Achaia; on the North Macedon; on the other parts the
Seas. In this Country Olimpias, Alexander the greats mother was borne; and also
Pyrrhus, who first of any forrainer made trial (to his own loss) of the
Roman puis^a^ce: and afterward in A^gos leaguer, was slain with a tile by an
old woman. Here is the mount Pind^^s sacred to Apollo and the ^^Mu^es; and the
Acrocera^nian hills, so called because they ^^e subject to thunderclaps. Here
are also the rivers Acher^n (...) Coc^^^^ f^r their color and taste called the
rivers of hell.

The Eastern part of this Province is called Acarnania: the Western is
Chao^ia: both very populous, until Paulus Aemilius overthrew 70 of their
Cities. The chief of the remainder are 1 Antogonia. 2 Cassiope. 3 Torona on
the river Thiamis in the Western part: and in the other 1 Nicopolis, Dion.
built by Augustus in the place where his land soldiers were encamped, before
the battle of Act^um: either in memory of his victory there; or else of a
man and his Ass whom he there met. For the night before the fight, he met a
poor man on an Ass, of whom he demanding his name was answered Eu^iches, that
is fortunate; and asking the name of his Ass, was told Nicon, that is
Conqueror: which happy omens made the Soldiers courageous and hopeful of
victory; and Augustus in memoriam sacti, erected there a couple of brazen
Images; one of the Ass, the other of his master. 2 Ambracia, now Larta, on the
upper end of the Bay of Ambracia, or the Gulf of Larta. 2 Leucas. 3
Anactorium. and 4 Actium, nigh unto which in the Sea of Lepanto, Augustus and
Antony fought for the Empire of the world. The Navy of the latter co^sisted of
500 Galleys; the former had 250 Galleys, adorned with the Trophies of victory.
Here also was fought that memorable Sea Fight, Anno. 1571, between the Turks,
Hist. of Ven.
who had a Navy of 270; and the Venetians having 145 Galleys; on which the
Lord of hosts bestowed victory. In this day there died of the Turks 29000 men,
and of the confederats 7656, or thereabouts. There were freed 1200 captive
Christians, taken Prisoners 3900 Turks; nigh 140 Galleys, and about 4000
pieces of Ordnance: so that this place seems to be marked for a stage of
great designs, and that this latter navall batta^le, was but the second part
of the first.

This Country was once called Molossia from the Molossi, whom Pyr^hus son to
Achilles brought under the yoke of servitude. From him descended that Pyrrhus,
who made war with the Romans, Anno mundi 3683. V.C. 471. After his death this
kingdom was shrewdly shaken by the Macedonians, and shortly after subdued by
Paulus Aemilius, who as we now said destroyed 70 Cities hereof in one day.
For desirous to satisfy his Soldiers after his victory in Macedon he sent
unto the Ep^rots for ten of the principal men of every City. These he
commanded to deliver up all the Gold and Silver which they had; and to that
end, as he gave out, he sent certain companies of Soldiers along with them;
unto whom he gave secret instructions, that on a day by him appointed, they
should fall to sack every one the Town, whereinto they were sent. A barbarous
and bloody decree, 70 Cities confederate with the Romans ruined in one day,
and no fewer then 150000 Epirots made and sold for slaves. This Country of
Epirus was rent from the Constantinopolitane Empire by Amurath the second, and
his son Mahomet.

4 ALBANIA.
ALBANIA is bounded on the East with Macedonia, on the West with the
Adriatique, on the North with Sclavonia; on the South with Epirus. Here are the
rivers Celidnus. 1 Laus. and 3 Baniasus. The chief Cities are 1 Albanopolis.

the Soldiers neither fainting in their oppositions, nor corrupted by money.
There was in the Town one only Well, into which a treacherous Christian cast a
dead dog; at the sight of which being the next day drawn up, the Soldiers
gave up the Town: being so unseasonably superstitious; that no persuasion, nor
the example of the Captain, or the Burgo-masters, could make them drink those
(as they thought them) defiled waters. 3. Durazzo, a town of great strength.
It was first called Epidamnum and afterward Dyrachium. Under the walls of this
Town, was the first bickering between the Soldiers of Caesar and Pompey; not
only to the present loss; but also the utter discomfiture of Caesar, as he
himself confessed; if the enemies captain had known how to have overcome. I
must not omit the valor of Sceva at this siege, who alone so long resisted.

This Country for the most part followed the fortune of Macedon, Turk. hist.
and Epirus; together with which, it was taken by Amurath: from whom it was
recovered by that worthy captain George Castrio^, nicknamed Scanderbeg, i. e.
Great Alexander. He was a most wary and politic soldier, giving a great
check to the Turkish victories, of which people it is recorded, that he slew
in several battles, 3000 with his own hands: and having held the cards
against two most fortunate gamesters, Amurath and Mahomet: he set up his rest a
winner. After his death and burial, his body was dug up by the Turks; and
happy man was he that could get the smallest piece of his bones, to preserve as
an inestimable Jewel: supposing that as long as he carried it about him, he
should be always invincible.

5 MACEDONIA.
MACEDONIA is bounded on the East with Migd^nia, on the West with Albania;
Maginus.
on the North with Misia superior, on the South with Epirus and Achaia. It was
called Hamonia, from mount Hoemus: Aemathia, from a king of it called Aemathus:
and Macedonia, from the King Macedo. Here is the fount P^mple, sacred to the
Pierian Goddesses. The chief cities are 1 Scydra. 2 Andaristus. 3 Aedessa all
midland towns. 4 Eribae^ on Albania side now called Pr^ssae. 5 Pidna seated on
the influx of the river Alaicmon into the bay called Sinus Thermaicus. In this
Town Cassander besieged, and by besiege took Olimpias the mother, Roxane the
wife, and Hercules the heir apparent of great Alexander: all which he
barbarously put to death. This cruelty he committed partly to revenge himself
on Alexander, who had once struck his head and the wall together; and partly
to cry quits with Olimpias, who had lately murdered K. Aridaeus, and Euridice
his Queen, Maginus.
with whom Cassander is thought to have been over familiar. 6 Pella standing
on the same shore, the birth place of the great Alexander, hence called
Pellaeus Iuvenis. And 7 Syderocaspae, called of old Chrysiles, famous for her
mines of gold and silver: which are so rich, that the Turk receaueth hence
monthly sometimes 18000, sometimes 30000 crowns de claro.

The Southern part of Macedon is Thessalis, a fruitful and pleasant Country.
Here is the hill Olympus, on which Hercules instituted the Olympicke games in
honor of Jupiter A.M. 2757 the exercises being merely bodily, as running with
Chariots, running on foot, wrestling, fighting with the whorlebats, and the
like. The reward given to the Victor were only Garlands of Pal^^e; yet did the
Greeks no less esteem that small sign of conquest and honor, then the
Romans did their most magnificent triumphs. The Judges in these games were the
Eleans, because in their City was the Temple and statua of Jupiter, surnamed
Olympicus. After the death of Hercules these Games were discontinued for 430
years, at which time one Iphitus, warned so to do by the Oracle of Apollo,
renewed them; causing them to be solemnly exercised every fifth year: from
which custom Olympias is sometimes taken for the space of ^ years; as qu^^^^^

before the Olympiads, and after the stood to be fabulous; but those that
followed these Olympiads to be historical, and these Olympiades were of long
time even from the restoration of them by Iphitus until the reign of the
Emperor Theodosius; the Grecian Epoche: from whence they reckoned their time.

situate the delectable vallie called Tompe* extending in length five, in
breadth 6 miles: so beautified with natures gifts, that it was supposed to be
the Garden of the Muses. And 5ly, here lived the Mirmidones, over whom at the
siege of Tr^y, Achilles was Captain. They were a sparing and labotious kind
of people; and were therefore ^ain^d by the Poets to have been Emmets, and
transformed into men at the request of Aeacus, when he wanted Soldiers.

A sparing folk and unto labor set;

And wary keepers of what ere they get.
The chief Towns of Th^ssalie are 1 Tricca, whose Bishop Heliodorus, made
that ingenious Poem of Theagenes, and Cariclia; which is entitled The
Aethiopique History; and chose rather to loose his Bishopric, then suffer his
book, which a Provincial Synod had judged to the fire, to be burned. A Poem
not so lascivious as many guess. Chaste and honest love is the subject of this
work; not such as old or modern Poets, in their Comoedies mention. Here is no
incestuous mixture of father and daughter; no pandarismes of old midwiues, no
unseemly action specified, where heat of blood and opportunity meet: nor in
deed any one passage unworthy the chastest ear. 2 Lamia where the Athenians
after the death of Alexander, hoping to recover their freedom, besieged
Antipater. This war was called Bellum Lamiacum, and was the last honorable
action, undertaken by that great and renowned City. 3 Demetrias seated on
Sinus Pelasgicus. 4 Larissa, situate South of Demetrias on the same bay, where
Achilles was borne. 4 Pharsalis, nigh unto which was that bloody battle
between Caesar and Pompey, for the Lordship of the world. Caesar herein was
conqueror. The victory was more famous then bloody, Plutarch.
six thousand men only among 300000, being slain. Before the field was
fought, the Pompeians were in such a miserable security, that some of them
contended for the Priesthood, which was Caesar's office: others disposed of the
Consulships and offices in Rome* Pompey himself being so retchlesse, that he
never considered into what place he were best retire, if he lost the day; or by
what means he might provide for his safety, and raise new forces. As if the
war had been made against some ignoble enemy, and not against Caesar; who
had taken 1000 Towns; conquered 300 nations; took prisoners one million of
men, and slain as many. In the same fields but somewhat nigher to the City of
Philippi, was the like memorable conflict between Augustus and Antoni^ on the
one side; and Brutus and Cassius on the other: these latter being by fortune
rather then valor overthrown. For either thinking the other vanquished, slew
himself: these two being the last that ever openly stood for the common
liberty; or as Cordus in Tacitus calls them, Vltimi Romanorum, The last of
all the Romans. And 5 Pherae where Alexander the tyrant reigned; against whom
that notable Captain Pelopidas fighting, was slain. He was in the end
murdered by his wives brothers: all Thessalie by his death recovering liberty.

Though Macedonia was never very famous, till the days of King Philip and his
son Alexander; yet it shall not be amiss to recite all the Kings, beginning
at Caranaus son to Macedo, the Nephew of Deucalion.

The Kings of Macedo.
3155 1 Caranaus 28 3182 2 Coenus 12. 3195 3 Tirmas 38 32^3 4 Perdiccas 51 3284

6 3605 22 Philip 24 3629 23 Alexander the Great.
Of these 23 Kings, only six are famous: viz: Caranaus the first King. He was
originally of Argos; and by an oracle commanded to lead a Colonie into this
Country; and to follow the first flock of Cattle he saw before him. Being
here arrived in a tempestuous stormy day, he espied a heard of Goats flying
the fury of the weather. These Goats he persued unto Aedessa, into which by
reason of the darkness of the air he entered undiscovered; won the town,
and in short space became Lord of all the country. 2ly P^rdiccas the fourth
king, who at Aega built a burial place for all his successors; assuring the
people that as long as their kings were there buried, his race should never
fail, and so it happened. For the kingdom of Macedon after the death of
Alexander the great, who was buried at Babylon, was translated to the sons of
Antipater. 3 Europus, who in his infancy was carried in a cradle against the
Illir^ans his enemies, and returned victorious. This the Macedons did, either
because they thought they could not be beaten, their King being present; or
persuaded themselves, that there was none so void of honor, and compassion as
to abandon an infant, no way able to save himself from destruction, but by the
valor and fidelity of his servants. 4 Alexander the son of Amy^tas, famous for
a noble exploit on the ^ersian Ambassadors; who being sent from Megabizus,
requested a view of the Macedon^an ^adies. No sooner were they entered; but
petulantius eas P^^sis contrectantibus, etc. they were called back by this
Alexander; sending in their steeds, young springals maidenly attired: who upon
the like indignities offered, slew these effeminate Asians. After this he
behaved himself so discreetly, that the Persian Monarch gave him all Greece,
between Hoemus and Olympus. 5 Philip father unto Alexander, who subdued
Peloponnesus, Achaia and Thrace, and was chosen Captain General of the Greeks
against the Persians. No sooner had he begun this war, but he was arrested by
death, with a writ of habeas corpus. 6 Alexander the son of Philip, who
recovered the greater part of Greece, which at his fathers death, flattered
themselves with hope of liberty. He subdued Darius of Persia, Toxiles and
Porus, kings of India: founded the Grecian Monarchy: and in the height of his
victories, was poisoned by Cassander at Babylon* After his death, his new-got
Empire was much controverted; he himself having bequeathed it to him whom the
soldiers reputed most worthy: and they according to their several
affections, thought their several Leaders best to deserve it. At last the
title of King was by general consent cast on Ari^aeus, a bastard of Philips:
to whom Perdiccas was appointed protector: (for Aridae^s was a little crazed in
his brain) and made General of all the Army. As for the Provinces, they were
assigned to the government of the chief Captains, as Egypt and Cyrene to
Ptol^mie; Syria to Laomedon; Cilicia to Philotas; Media to Pytho; Cappadocia to
Eumenes; Pamphilia, Lycia, and Phrygia mayor, to Antigonus; Caria to Cassander;
Lydia to Menander; P^ntus and Phrygia minor to Leonatus; Assyria to Seleucus;
Persis to Peucestes; Thrace to Lysimachus; and Macedonia to Antipater: the
other parts of the Persian Empire being left in their hands, unto whom
Alexander in his lifetime had entrusted them. This division continued long;
for Perdiccas being on^e sla^ne by Ptolomie and Eumenes, made away by
Antigonus; these two became quickly master of the rest; Ptolomie adding Syria
to Egypt, and Antigonus bringing under his command not only all Asia Minor,
but Assyria Media, and the rest of the Eastern parts of the Empire also.
Antipater in the mean time succeeding Perdiccas in the Proctourship, died*
which advantage Olympias (whom Antipater, extremely hating her, had banished
into Epirus) taking, entered Macedonia, put to death Aridaeus and his wife
Euridice, and proclaimed Hercules the son of Alexander, king; but was not
long after, together with her nephew and daughter, barbarously slain by
Cassander. The royal blood thus extinct, Antigonus took on himself the title
of King: the like did Seleucus, who had now recovered all the Persian Provinces
beyond Euphrates: the like did Ptolomie in Egypt, and Cassander in Macedon.

The second race of the Macedon Kings.
3648 1 Cassander, son unto Antipater, supposed to have bin the poisoner of
Alexander, rooted out the blood royal of Macedon; his reign full of troubles
and difficulties. 19 3667 2 Alexander and Antipater, sons to Cassander; but
not well agreeing, called unto their aid Lysimachus, and Demetrius, by whom
they were both in short time murdered. 4. 3671 3 Demetrius son to Antigonus
the powerful King of Asia, after he had in one battle against Seleucus, lost
both his Father and all his Asian Dominions: settled himself in Macedon: but
being there outed with Pyrrhus, he fled to Seleucus* and with him died. 6. 3677
4 Pyrrhus King of Epirus, was by the soldiers voluntarily forsaking Demetrius,
made King of Macedon: but after 7 months, the soldiers revolted to
Lysimachus, as being a Macedonian borne. 3678 5 Lysimachus Governor of Thrace,
being thus made King of Macedon, was in the end vanquished and slain by
Seleucus. 7 3685 6 Ceraunus son to Ptolomie of Egypt, having traitorously slain
his friend and patron Seleucus, seized on Macedon; but lost it, together with
his life unto the Gauls, who after they had left Italy, plagued these
countries. 2 3687 7 Antigonus Gonatas, son to Demetrius, was for his valor
shown in expulsing the Gauls, made King of Macedon: and though for a while he
gave way to Pyrrhus, then returning out of Italy, yet after Pyrrhus death, he
again recovered it. 36 3723 8 Demetrius, son to Antigonus, recovered the
Kingdom of Macedon: which Alexander one of the sons of Pyrrhus, had taken
from his father. 10. 3733 9 Antigonus Doson, left by Demetrius as Protector to
his young son Philip, took upon him the kingdom. He diverse times vanquished and
crushed the Greeks, then beginning to cast off the Macedonian yoke. 3745 10
Philippus son to Demetrius. 3787 11 Perseus the son of Philip. These two
were the subverters of the Kingdom of Macedon; for they not only molested the
Aetolians and other Grecians, whom the Romans had taken into their patronage;
but sided with the Carthaginians against them: which they not able to endure,
sent Paulus Aemilius with an Army to Macedon, to bring King Perseus to some
conformity. The event was answerable to the Roman fortune. Greece is made a
Province of their Empire, and Perseus with a dejected countenance follows the
triumphant chariot of Aemilius, after he had reigned 11 years. From the
Constantinopolitans, Macedon was wrested by Baiaz^t the first.
6 MIGDONIA.
Maginus.
MIGDONIA has on the East and South the Aegaean Sea* on the North Thrace; on
the West Macedon, of which by many, this Country is reckoned a part. Here is
the hill Athos, which is 75 miles in circuit, three days journey in height,
and casts a shadow as far as Lemnos, which is 40 miles distant. The chief
cities are 1 Stagira (now Nicalidi) where the famous Philosopher Arist. was
borne: a man so worthy, that Philip rejoiced he had a son borne in his time.
2 Apollonia. 3 Pallene, sacred to the Muses. 4 Neapolis on the borders of
Thrace. 5 Antigonia: and 6 Thessalonica, now called Salonichi, seated on the
Sea; to the people of which City, S. Paul writ two of his Epistles. It is a
populous city, replenished with Christians, Turks, and Jews; the last of
which swarm here in such abundance, that in this town and Constantinople
only, are reckoned 160000 Jews. Yet notwithstanding their multitude, they are
not here only, but in all places where they abide, not only contemned, but
hated; Biddulph.
and at every Easter in danger of death. For if they stir out of doors
between Maunday Thursday at noone, and Easter Eve at night, the Christians
among whom they dwell, will stone them; because at that time they crucified our
Savior, derided, and buffetted him. This Province has always followed the
fortune of Macedon.

7 THRACE.
THRACE has on the East Pontus Euxinus, Propontis, and Hellespont; on the West
Macedon, on the North the hill Haemus, on the South the Aegaean Sea. The people
are very bold and valiant, and called by some (...), because every man was a
law to himself. So that it was truly said by Herodotus, that if they had
either bin all of one mind, or under one king, they had bin invincible. The
Country of it self is neither of a rich soil, or pleasant air: the corn and
other seeds, by reason of the coldness of the Climate, leasurely ripening^ the
Vines yielding more shade, then juice; the trees more leaves then fruit. The
men were more courageous, then comely, wearing clothes according to their
conditions, ragged and unseemly. The married women were in love to their
husbands so constant, that they willingly sacrificed themselves at their
funerals. The Virgins were bestowed not by their own parents, but the common
Fathers of the cities. Such as brought neither beauty nor virtue for their
dowre, were put off according to their money, most times sold, as other cattle,
in the markets. Of the souls immortality they had all such a rude certainty,
and of life's miseries so known experience, that says mine Author, Lugentur
puerperia, natique deflentur; funera contra festa sunt, and veluti sacra cantu
lus^que celebrantur. Such were the old Thracians. Here lived the Tyrant
Polymnestor, who villanously murdered Polydorus a younger son of Priamus; for
which fact Hecuba the young Princes mother scratched him to death. Here lived
the Tyrant Tereus, of whom before in Phocis: and Diomedes, who using to feed
his horses with man's flesh, was slain by Hercules, and cast unto his horses.
And here reigned King Cotis, whom I mention not as a Tyrant, but propose as a
pattern of rare temper, both in mastering and preventing passion. For when a
neighbor Prince had sent him a present, of accurately wrought, and purely
mettall'd Glasses; he (having dispatched the messenger with all the due
complements of Majesty and gratitude) broke them all to pieces; lest if by
mishap, any of his servants doing the like, might stir him to an intemperate
choler.

This Country fell into the hands of Philip of Macedon, by a strife between two
brothers for the kingdom, who after many acts of hostility, at last appealed
to this Philip; and he making his best advantage out of their disagreement,
seized on it to his own use.

The chief Towns are Sestos on the Hellespont, just over against Abydos of
Asia; places famous for the love of Hero and Leandor. Maginus.
2 Abdera the birthplace of Democritus, who spent his life in laughing. 3
Po^idea, of old a colonie of the Athenians, from whom it revolted, and
submitted to Corinth. But the people of Athens not enduring this affront,
beleagured it, and after a two years siege by composition, took it; having
spent in its recovery two thousand talents. Plutarch.
4 Cardia seated in the Thracian Chersonese, which being a Peninsula, a butting
just over against Troas in Asia side, is now called St Georges arm. This
Cardia is seated on the Western side of it, opposite to the I Will of Lemnos; and
was the birthplace of Eumenes, who being a poor Ca^riers son, attained to
such ability in the art of war: that after the death of Alexander the Great,
under whom he served, he seized on the provinces of Cappadocia and Paphlagonia:
and siding (though a stranger to Macedon) with Olympias and the blood royal,
against the Greek Captains; vanquished and slew Craterus, and diverse times
drove Antigonus (afterward Lord of Asia) out of the field: but being by his own
soldiers betrayed, he was by them delivered to Antigonus, and by him slain. 5
Lys^^achia on the sea shore, Knoll. ^.
built by Lysimachus, who after Alexanders death, laid hand on this Country. 6
Callipolis, situate on the Northern promontorie of the Chersonesse, the first
town that ever the Turks had in Europe, it being surprised by Solomon, son to
Orchanes, Anno 1358. 7 Traianopolis, founded by Traian 8 Adrianople built by
Adrian the Emperor, and added to the Empire of the Turks by Bajazet 1362. It
was from the first taking of it, the seat of the Turkish Kings, until Mahomet
the Great by the disunion of Christendom, forced Constantinople, and
transferred the seat to that city. 9 Pera, of old Galata, a Town of the
Genowaies: It was taken by Mahomet the Great, Anno 1453: in which year he
brought such a reckoning before Constantinople, that she not able to discharge
her score, forfaited her liberty. 10 Constantinople is seated in a commodious
place for an Empire, ouer-looking Europe and Asia; and commanding the Euxine
Sea, Propontis, and Hellespont. It is in compass 18 miles, in which compass
are comprehended 700000 living souls: yet certainly it would be more populous,
if the plague like a Tertian ague, did not so rage amongst them every third
year. It was built by Pausanias a Lacedaemonian Captain, 663 years before
Christ's appearing in the flesh; and was by him called Bizantium: It was of
wonderful strength at the beginning of the Roman Empire. The walls were of a
just height, every stone being cemented together with brass couplets, that the
whole wall seemed to be but one entire stone: neither wanted there turrets,
bulwarks, and other fortifications* This City sided with Niger against
Severus, and held out a siege of three years, against almost all the forces of
the world. During this time they endured such want of sustenance, that men
meeting in the streets, would (as it were) with joint consent, draw and fight,
the victor still eating the vanquished: For want of artillery to discharge on
the assailants, they flung at them whole Statua's made of brass; and the like
curious Imagery. Houses they plucked down to get timber for shipping; the hair
of their women they cut off, to inch out their tacklings: and having thus
patched up a Navy of 500 sail, they lost it all in one tempest. When they had
yielded, the Conqueror having put to the sword the chief of the Nobles, and
given the rest as a spoil to the soldiers, dismantled the Town, and left it
almost in rubbish: yet there appeared such signs of beauty and strength in the
very ruins, V^ mireris an eorum quip^imi extruxerunt, vel horum qui deinceps
sunt demoliti, vires sint praestantiores. Afterward it was reedified by
Constantine the Great, who made it the seat of his Empire, and thus named it,
Anno 315. He adorned also this City with magnificent buildings, with curious
statues, and the like ornaments: which he hither transported from Rome: which
City he spoiled of more ancient and costly monuments, then any twenty of his
predecessors had brought thither. At this day the chief buildings are the
Turks Seraglio, and the Temple of Saint Sophia, which as they differ not much
in place and situation, Sands.
so as little in magnificence and state. The Temple of St Sophia, was, if not
built, yet reedified by the Emperor Justinian. It is built of an ovall form,
surrounded with pillars of admirable workmanship, adorned with spacious and
beautiful galleries, roofed all over with Mosaique work, and vaulted
underneath very strongly for the fabric, and pleasing for the eye. The doors
are very curiously wrought, and plated; one of which by the superstitious
people is thought to have bin made of the planks of Noah's Arc: and yet this
Temple is little more then the Chancell of the ancient Church, which contained
in length 260 foot, and 180 in height; and to our Saint Paul's in London, may
seem for the bigness to have bin but a chapel of ease. It is now a Turkish
Mosquo, and joins close to the Seraglio, which is divided from the rest of
the City by a lofty wall 3 miles in circuit. It was first built by the Emperor
Justinius, and has bin by the Ottomans much enlarged; the buildings yielding to
those of France, and Italy, for contriuement: but far surpassing them for
cost and curiousness. It contains 3 Courts one within the other, very
pleasing both for exercise and recreation.

Constantinople, the space of 3 years: and when by cold and famine, 300000 of
them were slain, they desisted. At this siege was that fire invented, which we
for the violence of it, call wild fire, and the Latins, because the Greeks
were the Authors of it, Graecus ignis: by which the Saracen ships were not a
little molested. 741 32 Constantinus Copronymus 35 777 33 Leo IV. 5 782 34
Irene, in whose time the Empire was divided into the East and the West. For the
Popes knowing their greatness to grow out of the ruins of the temporal power,
committed the Empire of the West unto the French Princes; whereby the Greek
Emperors became much weakened; and the French being the Popes creatures, were
in tract of time at their devotion. When Frederick Barbarossa was by Pope
Alexander 3d pronounced non-Emperour Emanuel of Constantinople sued for a
reunion of the Empires: but the crafty Pope returned this answer, Non licere

Concerning this Empire we may observe some fatal contrarieties in one and the
same name: as first Philip the father of Alexander, laid the first foundation
of the Macedonian Monarchy; and Philip the father of Perse^s r^ined it.
Secondly, Baldwin was the first, and Baldwin the last Emperor of the Latins,
in Constantinople. Thirdly, this town was built by a Constantine, the son of a
Helena, a Gregory being Patriarch; and was lost by a Constantine, the son of
a Helena, a Gregory being also Patriarch. And fourthly, the Turks have a
prophecy, that as it was won by a Mahomet, so it shall be lost by a Mahomet.
So Augustus was the first established Emperor of Rome, and Augustulus the
last: Darius the son of Histaspes the restorer, and Darius the son of
A^samis the ouerthrower o^ the Persian Monarchy. A like note I shall anon tell
you of Jerusalem, in the mean time I will present you with a fatal
observation on this letter H, as I find it thus versed in Albions England. Not
superstitiously I speak, but H this letter still,

A strange and ominous letter; every mutation in our state being as it were
vshered in by it.
What were the revenues of this Empire since the division of it into the East
and West, I could never yet learn. That they were exceeding great, may appear
by three circumstances. 1 Zonaras reports that the Emperor Basilius had in
his treasury 200000 talents of gold, besides infinite heaps of silver and
other moneys. 2ly Lipsius relates how Benjamin a Jew, in his discourse of
Europe, says that the customs due to the Emperor, out of the victuals and
merchandise sold at Constantinople only, did amount to 20000 Crowns daily.
3ly we find that at the sack of Constantinople, there was found an invaluable
mass of gold, silver plate, and Jewels, besides that which was hid in the
earth. For so the covetous Citizens chose rather to employ their wealth, then
afford any part of it to the Emperor, who with tears in his eyes, went from
door to door to beg or borrow money, wherewith he might wage more soldiers
for the defense of the Town.

The Arms of the Empire are Mars, a cross Sol, between four Greek Beta's of
the second; the four Beta's signifying, (as Bodin says) (...).

Expectation may perchance wait here, for a historical relation of the nature
of the Turks; their customs, forces, policies, original, and proceedings:
the discourse whereof we will de^erre till we come to Turcomania, a Province of
Armenia, from whence this populous Nation first made their inundations; like to
some irresistable torrent, into Persia, and the other parts of the World, now
subject unto their imperious fury. And though the Peninsula, called Tauri^a
Chersonesus, or Tartaria Precopensis* be within the bounds of Europe: yet we
will defer the description of it, till we come to speak in general of the
Tartars; and will now speedily sail about the Grecian Seas, and discover their
Islands.

Thus much of Greece.

THE GRECIAN ISLES.
Having discoursed of the Continent, and its particular kingdoms; we will say
somewhat also of the Sea, and its particular Isles: which lie dispersed either
in the Grecian, 2 Cretan, 3 Ionian, 4 Adriatique, 5 Mediterranean, 6 British,
or 7 Northern Seas; and first of such as are about the coasts of Greece.

The first Sea which offreth it self unto us, is Palus Maeotis, so called of
the Maeotae, who formerly inhabited about the banks of it. It is nourisht by
the river Phasis, Tanais, and infinite others, and abounds with a kind of
fish, which the ancients called Maeotides. The present name of this Sea, is Mar
di la Tana, and has in it no Island of note. Hence the Sea going Southward, is
brought into a narrow straight, called Bosphorus Cimmerius, from the Cimmerij
who here dwelt: of no great breadth, in that oxen have swomme over it, and in
length about 27 miles. This straight opens into Pontus Euxinus.

Pontus Euxinus is in compass 2700 miles, Boterus.
and was first called (...), from the inhospitablenesse of the neighboring
people, which being brought to some conformity, caused the sea to be called
(...). It is now called Mare Maggiore for its greatness: and the Black Sea,
because of the dark mists thence arising. Others not improbably affirm, that
it is called the Black sea, from the dangerous and black shipwrackes here
happening: For it is a very dangerous shore, full of rocks and sands: and for
this cause there is on the top of an high tower, a lantherne, in which there is
a great pan full of pitch, rozen, tallow, and the like, in dark nights
continually burning, to give warning to mariners, how near they approach the
shore. This Sea being the biggest of all these parts, gave occasion to them
which knew no bigger, to call all Sea a by the name of Pontus, as Ovid, Omnia
pontus erant; deerant quoque littora ponto: and in another place of the same
Poet, -- Nil nisi pontus and aer; a better reason doubtless of the name, then
that of the Etymologists, Pontus quia ponte caret. Of this sea the chief Isles
are 1 Thinnius, and Erithinnus, little famous.

Strabo.
The Sea bending Southward, is coarctated into narrow bounds, not being fully a
mile broad; and called Thracius Bosphorus: Thracius for its site nigh Thrace;
and Bosphorus for that Oxen have swomme over it. It has no Island worth naming.

This straight having continued 20 miles in length, opens it self into the
Propontis 330 miles in compass, now called Mare di Marmora, from the Island
Marmora: which formerly called Proconesus, has for its abundance of Marble,
purchased this new name.

The Sea having gathered her waters into a lesser Channel, is called
Hellespont; from Hell, daughter to Athamas King of Thebes, who was here
drowned. Over thi^ straight, Xerxes did make a bridge of boats to pass into
Greece; which when a sudden tempest had shrewdly battered, he caused the Sea
to be beaten with 300 stripes, and cast a pair of fetters into it, to make it
know to whom it was subject. Herodotus.
Xerxes in this expedition wafted over an Army consisting of two millions and
164610 fighting men, in no less then 2208 bottomes of all so^ts. When all the
Persians soothed the King in the vnconquerablenesse of his forces, Artabanus
told him, that he feared no enemies but the Sea and the Earth; the one yielding
no safe harbor for such a Navy; the other not yielding sufficient sustenance
for so multitudinous an Army. His return over this Hellespont was as
dejected, as his passage magnificent; his fleet was broken by the valor of the
Greeks, and the fury of the sea; so that for his more speedy flight, he was
compelled to make use of a poor fisher boat. Neither yet was his passage
secure: the boat being ouer-burdened, had sunk all, if the Persians by casting
away themselves, had not saved the life of their King: The loss of which noble
spirits so vexed him, that having given the Steeresm^n a golden Coronet for
preserving his own life, he commanded him to execution, as a coauthor of the
death of his servants. It is now called the castles, or the sea of the two
castles; which two castles stand one on Europe, the other on Asia side; in the
same places where once stood Sestos and Abydos. These castles are exceeding
well built, and abundantly furnished with munition. They search and examine all
ships that pass that way: they receive the Grand Signieurs customs; and are
in effect the principal strength of Constantinople. At these castles all
ships must stay three days; to the end, that if any slave be run away from
his master, or thieves have stolen any thing, they may be in that space
pursued and apprehended. In this Hellespont is the Island Tenedos, on Asia side.
It is in compass ten miles, and was so called from one Tenes, who abhorring
the lascivious entreaties of his mother, was by her command cast into the Sea,
fast locked in a Chest; and here most miraculously delivered, as Strabo
writes: Insula dives opum, Priami dum regna manebant.
An Island rich, full of delight,
When Priams kingdom stood upright.


Hellespont after a forty miles course, expatiateth its waters in the Aegaean
Sea; so called either from Aegaeus the father of Theseus, who misdoubting his
sons safe return from the Minotaure of Crete, here drowned himself: or 2ly
from Aege once a principal City in the prime Island Euboea; or 3ly because that
the Islands lie scattered up and down like the leapes of a wanton Goat, in
Greek called (...).

The chief Islands are 1 Samothracia. 2 Lemnos. 3 Lesbos. 4 Chris. 5 Euboen 6
Scyros. 7 Salamis. 8 the Sporades, and 9 the Cyclades.

1 SAMOTHRACIA.
SAMOTHRACIA is a small Island, Strabo.
and little famous: only proud in this, that Pythagoras that divine
Philosopher, and Samo one of the Sybils, were here borne. Here also was Juno by
the Poets fained to have bin borne, because Juno allegorically signifies the
Air, which is here most clear and pure. The chief town is Samia, beautified
with a goodly harbor, but now by the pirates often infesting these seas, almost
left desolate.

2 LEMNOS.
LEMNOS contains in circuit 100 miles. The chief city was Hephestia, where
Vulcan was adored, who being but a homely brat, was by Juno cast down hither,
and so no marvel if he have got a halting. Here is dug the sovereign
mineral against infections, called Terra Lemnia, and Sigillata. The former
name proceeds from the Island: the latter is in force, because the earth made
into little pellets, is sealed with a Turkish Character or signet, and so
dispersed over Christendom. It was once called also Diospolis from the two
chief cities herein, of which the first was Hephestia aboue-named, now
altogether decayed: the 2d Lemnos or Myrina, yet continuing, though with no
great luster. The Country is plain, is compared with the adjacent Islands, the
Western parts dry and barren, the East more fat and fruitful. It contains
in all 75 Villages, inhabited by the Greeks all except three, which are
fortified by the Turks; who being Lords of the whole Island, call it by a new
name, Stalimene.

3 LESBOS.
Strabo.
LESBOS on the Asian side, contains in compass 168 miles: the South and West
parts being but mountainous and barren, the rest level and fruitful. The
chief cities are Erissus. 2 Methimna, and 3 Mitilene. The former is of little
estimation, the two latter took name from the two daughters of Macarios; the
elder of which Mitilene was married to Lesbos (the son of Lapithus) of whom the
whole Island took denomination. This town in the Peloponnesian war, Pezel. in
Sleidan.
wherein all the States of Greece banded against Athens, revolted from the
party of that City, and was by Paches an Athenian Captain, so straightly
besieged, that the people submitted to his mercy. Paches sent to the Council
of Athens, to know in what sort he should deal with the vanquished M^tilenians;
who commanded him to put them all to the sword. But on the morrow after,
repenting this cruel sentence, they sent a countermand. These later messengers
made no stay, but eating with one hand, and towing with the other, they came to
Mitilene just as Paches was reading the former decree. So near were these
miserable people to a fatal and final destruction. In the general mutation of
soueraignties, this Island followed the fortune of the Roman and Greek
Emperors; Sands.
till Ca^o Johannes in the year 1355, gave it to Catalusius a Nobleman of
Genoa, in dowry with his sister. His posterity inioyed it* till M^homet the
Great seized on it, Anno 1462. In this Island were borne Sappho an heroic
woman, whose invention was the Sapphick verse, and is therefore called the
tenth Muse: 2 Pittacus one of the wise men of Greece; 3 Theophrastus that
notable Physician and Philosopher; 4 Arion, who was so expert on his Harp,
that being cast into the sea, playing on that instrument, a Dolphin took him on
his back, and carried him to the shore. And, Alcaeus the successor of Orpheus
in the excellency of Lyricall poesy.

4 CHIOS.
CHIOS 125 miles in circuit, took denomination, as some say, Biddulph.
of a certain Nymph called Chious; as others conjecture from (...), nix. At
this day this Island only bears that sweet gum, which Apothecaries call
mastick, which in the month of July and August, the people force out of the
trees, by making with their sharp instruments, deep incisions into the barks
of them; out of which the juice dropping, is afterward hardened like to a gum,
and in September following gathered. Others think this Island to be so named
from Chio the chief City: the people of which were once Lords of the Sea,
maintaining a Navy of 80 ships. It took the name of Chios, in that it was
built after the fashion or likeness of the Greek letter (...), even as that
part of Egypt, which lies between the two extreme channels of Nilus, is called
Delta; because it resembles that letter reversed. This town is one of the 7
which contended for Homers birth, whose sepulcher the Chians say, is yet to be
seen in an old castle on the hill H^lias. It is now called Sio. In this Island
there are infinite store of partridges, which are of a red color; They are
kept tame, and fed in flocks like geese, in the streets and greens warths of
the villages: some little boy or girl driving them to field, and with a
whistle calling the^ home again. The most excellent wines of all Greece are
made in this Country, called Vina Chia. The people of this Country were
successively subject to the Roman and Greek Princes, till Andronicus
Paleologus gave them and their I Will to the Justinians, a family of Genoa; from
whence it was taken by Solomon the Magnificen, on Easter day, 1566.

5 EVBOEA.
EVBOEA is situate on Europe side, over against Ch^os. It has bin known by
the diverse names of Abantis, Macris, Euboea, now Negropont, Strabo.
and is in compass 365 miles. It is in fertility parallel to Achaia; from
which it was once rent by an Earthquake; so that between the Island and
Continent is only a little Euripus; which ebbeth and flows seven times in
one day: the reason of which when Aristotle could not find, it is said that he
threw himself into the Sea, with these words: Quia ego non capio te, tu capias
me. In this Island is the Promontory Capareus, where Nauplius the father of
Palamedes, placed his false fires, to the destruction of so ma^y Greeks. For
understanding how his son Palamedes, whom he deemed to have been slain by the
hand of Paris, was treacherously circumvented by the policy of Ulysses and
Diomedes; he conceived such a displeasure against the whole host of the
Grecians, that he intended their general destruction. To this end he caused
fires to be made on the tops of the most dangerous and inaccessible rocks in
this whole Island; which the Greeks taking (according to the custom of the
time) to have bin the marks of some safe haven, made thitherward, and were
there miserably cast away, there perishing 200 ships, and many thousand men.
But when Nauplius understood how Diomedes and Ulysses, whose ruin he
principally intended, were escaped; he drowned him for very vexation, in this
very same place. Palamedes this Na^plius son, is said to have invented four of
the Greek letters, viz: (...), to have first instituted sentinels in an Army,
and to have bin the inventor of watch-words. The chief cities of Euboea are 1
Chalcis, situate just against the Continent, to which it was once joined by a
bridge. This town when it was in the hands of the Kings of Macedon, t^gether
with Demetrias in Thessalie, and the castle of Acro-Corinthus, nigh unto
Corinth, were called the setters of Greece; insomuch that when the Roman Senate
commanded Philip the father of Perseus to set the Grecians at liberty; the
Grecians made answer, that in vain was their liberty restored the^, unless
these 3 towns were first dismantled. This Chalcis was taken from the Venetians
by the Turks, and together with it the whole Island, Anno 1451. The second own
is Euboea, or Negroponte, 3 Caristia. The principal rivers are Cireus, and
Nileus; if a sheep drink of the former, his wool turns white; if of the
latter, coal black, as Strabo relates.

6 SCYROS.
SCYROS is famous for the birth of Neoptolimus, or Pyrrhus; and in that it was
the lurking-place of Achilles: For his m^ther being by an Oracle forewarned,
that he should be slain in the Trojan war, sent him, now well grown, to
Lycomedes King of this Island; where in woman's attire he was brought up amon^st
the Kings daughters, and deemed a maiden, till by the getting of Pyrrhus on
Deidamia the Kings daughter, it was proved to be otherwise; and he by Ulysses
was compelled to accompany the other Grecians to the war.

7 SALAMIS.
SALAMIS is night unto Megaris, famous for the overthrow of the populous Navy
of Xerxes, Plutarch.
by the Athenians and their confederats. What was the number of the soldiers
and galleys of the Persian side, has already bin declared. The Grecian fleet
consisted of 270 vessels, whereof 127 were rigged and set forth at the charge
of the Athenians only; the rest by the associates. Yet was the admiralty
committed to Euribiades ^ Lacedaemonian; the Athenians preferring the maine
care of the common safety, before an unseasonable contention for priority. The
Spartans seeing the inequality of forces, intended not to have hazarded the
battle; but with full sail to have retired to Peloponnesus, into which
Country the Persians had made incursions: respecting more the welfare of their
own Country yet defensible, then the desperate estate of Attica. This design
was by Themistocles (as careful for the state of Athens, as they for Sparta)
signified to Xerxes: who getting between them and home, compelled them to a
necessity of fighting: But to his own ruin. For in the conflict, more then 200
of his ships were sunk, and most of the rest taken; the confederats having lost
of their Navy forty only. Between the Athenians and Megarenses, were many
contentions for this Island.

8 SPORADES.
The SPORADES so called from (...) Spargo, because they are so scattered and
dispersed about the Sea, are in n^mber 12. The princ^pall are 1 Melos a
Con^to^, 3 A^^^e, and of these, Melos is of most note, M^ginus
, which is now called Mi^o, and took its first name for its abundance of honey.
It is in form round, and contains 80 miles in circuit. The soil is
fruitful sufficiently of grain and oils, deficient only in wine. Here is
good store of marble, curiously spotted, and no small store of milstones. Here
is also great quantity of pitch and brimstone, and some sulphury or hot
springs, good for many diseases.

9 The CYCLADES.
Strabo.
The CYCLADES, so called because they lie in a circle round about Delos, are in
number 53. They are also called the Islands of the Arches, because they are in
the sea called Archipelago. They stand so close together, that in a clear day
a man may see 20 of them at a time: for which cause it is with good reason
accounted to be a dangerous place for sailers in a storm. The chief of these
Cyclades, are 1 Delos quasi (...), signifying apparent; because when all the
earth had abiured the receipt of Latona, at the request of Juno: this Island
then under water, was by Jupiter erected aloft, and fixed to receive her; and in
it was she delivered of Apollo and D^ana. Ovid.
-- Erratica Delos
Errantem accepit, tunc cum le vis insula nabat:
Illic incumbens sub Paelladis arbore palma,
Edidit invita, Geminos, Latona, noverca.
Unsettled Delos floating on the wave
A little Island, entertainment gave
To wandering Laton; spite of Juno's head,
Under Minerua's palm tree brought to bed.
Notable also is this Island for the temple of Apollo, and a custom neither
permitting men to die, or children to be borne in it: but sending sick men,
and great bellied women to Rhena, a small Island, and not much distant.

Stephanus.
2 Samos, where the Tyrant Polystates lived, so fortunate, as he never had any
mischance. That he therefore might have some misfortune, he cast a ring which
he much esteemed, into the sea; which after he had found in the belly of a fish
brought to his table, he was by Orontes a Persian brought to a miserable death:
Leaving us an example, that fortune certain in nothing but incertainties; like
a Be with a sharp sting, has always some misery following a long
concarination of felicities.

3 Coos (now Lange) where Hippocrates was borne, who reviued Physic, then
almost lost. Here was Aesculapius worshipped, having his Temples and Altars,
Strabo.
as unto whom this Island was dedicated. In this Temple stood the picture of
Venus naked, as if new rising out of the Sea; made by Apelles, who was borne in
this Island; and who at the drawing thereof assembled all the beautiful women
of this Country, comprehending in that one piece all their particular
perfections. The chief town Coos is inhabited by Turks only, the villages by
Grecians.

4 Patmos, Sands.
where S. John the Divine did write his Revelation, being confined hither by
Domitian. His hand the Greek Priests affirm to be reserved in the principal
Monastery hereof; and that the nails thereof being cut, do grow again. The
Island is very harborous, by which means only, the people live; for the
country is of it self so barren, that it affoordes nothing almost fit for
sustenance.

5 Giaros a little Island, into which the Romans used to banish delinquents:
hence that of Iuvenal, Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris, vel carcere dignum,
Si vis esse aliquid; probitas landatur and alget.
If thou intendst to thrive, do what deserves
Short Gyaros or Gives: praised virtue sterues.
These Islands lie part in Asia, part in Europe, all in the Iear^an Sea; so
called from Icarus, who flying from Creet, and not following his father Dedalus
directly, was here drowned. Dum petit infirmis nimium sublimia pennis Ov. de
trist.

Icarus, Icarijs nomina fecit aquis.
Whilst Icarus weak wings too high did soar,
He fell, and christened the Icarian shore.
The other Islands dispersed about the Greekish Seas, and yielding nothing
worthy of relation, I purposely omit: only this I observe, that most of the 69
Kings which went with Agamemnon to the siege of Troy, were kings only of these
small Islands; and so I pass to the Islands in the Cretan seas, the chief of
which is Creta. Thus much of the Grecian Islands.

CRETA.
CRETA is situate in the mouth of the Aegaean Sea, it is in compass 590 miles,
in length 270, in breadth 50 miles.

Ortelius.
The soil is very fruitful, especially of wines, which we call Muscadels: of
which they transport yearly 12000 butts, together with Sugar Candy, Gummes,
Honey, Sugar, Olives, Dates, Apples, Orenges, Lemmons, Raisins, Mellons,
Citrons, Pomgranats; yet, as other countries of the like hot nature, it is not
a li^le deficient in corn, the most or greatest part of which is yearly
brought hither from Peloponnesus.

The Island is very populous, insomuch that it is thought that upon any sudden
occasion, the Signeurie of Venice can raise in it 60000 men able to bear
arms. The people have formerly bin good seafaring men; a virtue commaculated
with many vices, which they yet retain; as envy, malice, and lying; to which
last they were so addicted, that an horrible lie was termed Cretense mendacium.
This fault was aimed at by Epimenides, whose words are cited by Saint Paul to
Titus, Chap. 1. Verse. 2. (...)
The Cretans are liers, evil beasts, slow bellies.
To which let me add this proverb, (...); that is, there are three nations
whose names begin with K, worse then other, viz: Cretans, Cappadocians,
Cilicians.

The Cretans speak promiscuously the Greek and Latin tongues, and follow the
Greek and Latin Churches.

The chief rivers are Melipotomos, 2 Epici^inus, 3 Scasinus, 4 Catarachus.
None of them deep or commodious for shipping; yet for her many harbors, and
convenient situation, nigh both to Europe, Africa, and Asia: the great
Philosopher termed her The Lady of the Sea. For it is distant from the lesser
Asia 100 miles, as many from Peloponnesus; and 150 from Africa; so that it
seems to be seated in the middle of the Mediterranean, and that according to
Virgil, Creta Iovis magni medio iacet insula ponto.
Jove's birthplace Crete, a (...) l^nd,
In The middle of of the sea does stand.
By this conveniencie of situation, they became (as we have said) excellent
seafaring men; insomuch, that when the people of those times used to tax an
unlikely report, they would say, Cretensis neseit pelagus; it is as improbable,
as for a Cretan to be no sailer.

Here are three marvelous things in this Island. First, it breeds no venomous
worms, or hurtful creature. 2 If a woman bite a man any thing hard he will
never recover. Quade.
3 They have an ^earbe called Allimos, which if one chaw in his mouth, he shall
feel no hunger that day.

The chief Cities of old were Gnossus, where Minos kept his Court. 2 Cydonia.
3. Cortyna, nigh unto which was the Labyrinth made by Dedalus, Ortelius.
to include the Minotaure: which was afterward killed by Theseus, and 4 Aphra.
All these have now resigned priority to Candie the Metropolis, much inhabited
by the Venetians. 2 Cunea. 3 Rhetimo, and 4 Sittia.

This Country was once called Hecatompolis, for that it had in it an hundred
Cities; after the Creta, quasi Cureta, from the Curetes. Here reigned Saturn
father to Jupiter, which was borne here, Strabe.
and nursed in the hill Dicte, whence he is sometimes called Dictaeus: here
also lived Minos and Radamantus, whose laws were after in itated in the prime
Cities of Greece; and who for their equity on earth, are fained by the Poets to
be (with Aeacus) the Judges in hell. Here lived Strabo the Cosmographer, and
the lewdly-lustful^ Pasiphae, who doted on a white Bull, who they say begat on
her the Minotaure; Dadalus having framed for her an artificial cow into which
she conveied her self, and by that means obtained her desire. The fable is
thus expounded, that Pasiphae was in love with Taurus, one of Mino^
Secretaries, whose company by the pandarisme of Dadalus she enjoying, was
delivered of two sons, one called ^inos, the other Taurus. And whereas it is
said, that the Minotaure was slain by Theseus, like enough that the annual
tribute of 7 children which the Arthenians paid to Minos, was laid up in some
prison, Minos, and Taurus being the keepers or Iaylors. As for the action of
Pasiphae, I think it not altogether impossible to be true; considering how
Domitian to verify the old relation, exhibited the like beastly spectacle in
his amphitheatre at Rome. For says Martial,

Iunctam Pasiphaen Dictaeo, credit, Tauro
Vidim^s; accepit fabula prisca fidem.
Nec se miretur (Caesar) longava vetustas,
Quicquid fama canit, donat arena tibi
The fable's proved a truth, our eyes did see
The Cretan Bull sport with Pasiphae:
Triumph not then antiquity; that thing
Our Cirques have showed, which fame did only sing.
This Country was subjected to the Romans by Marcellus, (surnamed for this
action) Creticus: and being afterward part of the Greek Empire, was called
Candie, either from the chief city, or the white rocks: It was given by
Baldwin Earl of Flanders, the first Latin Emperor of Constantinople, to
Boniface of Montferrat; who sold it Anno 1194, to the Venetians: who
notwithstanding all real rebellio^s of the natives, and threatened invasions of
the Turks, still enjoy it. For for the defense of it from a foreign power,
they have furnished the Island with 78 or 80 Galleyes for the defense of the
shores: and have exceedingly fortified the haven of Suda, with two strong
castles; this haven being capable of more then 1000 vessels, and therefore
meritoriously reputed the door and entry into the country. It is reported
that the King of Spain, Philip 2d, did offer unto the Venetians for this
haven, money more then enough; but it could not be accepted. For though the
Spaniard seemed only to intend the retreit and relief of his own Navy, when
he should undertake any expedition against the Turk; yet the wise Venetians
saw, that by this haven he might at all times awe, and when he listed, surprise
the whole Country. Against the attempts of the natives, they have garrisoned
Canea with 7 companies of soldiers: Candie with 2000 soldiers, and the
lessers cities proportionably; over which there is set so straight a guard,
that a natural Cretian is not permitted to enter weaponed into any of them.

The Islands in this Sea of less note, are Claudi. 2 Dio. 3 Aegilia, of which
nothing is famous.

Creta contains
Archbishops 2 Bishops 8
Thus much of the Cretan Islands.

THE IONIAN ISLES.
THe IONIAN sea is so called either from one Ionius, Stephanus.
whom Hercules having in a fury killed, did here drown (as Didimus) or from
Io^a a region in the extremity of Calabria (as Solinus) or from Io daughter to
Inachus (as Lycophron.) The principal Islands of it are, 1 Cythera. 2 the
Strophades. 3 Zacynthias. 4 the Echinades. 5 Cephalenia. 6 Corcyra. 7 Ithaca. 8
Leucadia.

1 CYTHERA.
CITHERA, now called Cerigo, is in compass 60 miles; and about some 5 miles
distant from Cape Malo in Peloponesus. Strabe.
It was formerly called Porphyris, from the abundance of marble, whereof the
mountains yield good plenty. Defended it is by the rocks in themselves
inaccessible, which on all sides environ i^: havens it has many, but those
small, and difficult to enter. It has a town also of the same name with the
Island, in which was the Temple dedicated to Venus, out of which Helena the wife
of Menelaus, was willingly ravished by Paris. From the honor done by these
Ilanders to Venus, she is called Cytheraea; as in Virgil:

Parce metus Cytheraea, manent immota tuoruns
Fata ^ibi.
D^iue fear fair Cytherea from thy mind,
Thou thy sons fate immovable shall find.
2 THE STROPHADES.
The STROPHADES, are two Islands called now Strivall, lying against Mess^nia;
Sands.
famous for nothing but the Harpies, which ravenous birds were driven away by
Zethus and Calanus, at the request of Phineus K. of Arcadia. Concerning these
Harpies, Alphonso king of Naples used to say, that they had left the Strophades
and dwelt at Rome. They are inhabited only by some few Greek Friars, and in
one of them there is a Spring of fresh water, which has his fountain in
Peloponesus, and passing under the Sea arises here. The Greek Priests are
called Calo^res qu^si (...), Biddulph*
bonus Sacerdos. They are about 30 in number; they wear long hair, never eat
flesh, and (but at some seasons of the year) seldom fish: ^eeding usually of
herbs, olives, oil, and the like. They never go out of the Islands, neither
do they on any occasion permit women to come amongst them. They all labor for
their sustenance, some in tillage, some vineyards, some in fishing, so that
among very many of them three or four only can read.

3 ZACINTHVS.
ZACINTHVS or Z^nt is 60 miles in compass; and distant from Peloponesus 20
miles: Ortelius.
it was so called of Zacinthus son to Dordanus. The Country is wonderfully
stoared with oil, wines, currants, of which last they make yearly 150000
Z^cchines for their own coffer^: and 18000 Dollars, which they pay for custom
to the Signe^ry of Venice. Biddulph.
They were a very poor people when the English used to traffic there first;
but now they grow rich and proud. At our Merchants first frequenting the
country, they much marvelled to what end they bought so many currants, and
demanded whether they used to dye clothes, or fat hogs with them, for so
they themselves did: but now they have learned a more profitable use of them.
This Island is much troubled with earthquakes commonly once a week; in regard
whereof they build their houses very low: and when they perceive them commi^g,
the Priests use to ring the bells to stir^e the people to prayers. Sands.
They have a custom here at weddings to invite many young men whom they call
Cempeeres, of which every one gives to the bride a ring; which done, it is an
abuse as de^estable a incest, to accompany her in any carnal kind: wherefore
they choose such for Compe^res, as have formerly been suspected of too much
familiarity. The chief City is called also Zant not very large, the streets
uneven and rugged, and the buildings by reason of the often earthquakes very
low. On the East side of it, on a round steep mountain stands a well
ga^ri^ond and munitioned castle, which commands not the City and the harbor
only, but a great part of the sea also. Upon the wall there continually
stands a watchman to descry what shipping approaches and hangs out as many
flagges as he discovers vessels. Over the Praetorian hall door of this City
these verses are inscribed.

Hiclocus, 1 odit, 2 amat, 3 punit, 4 consorvat, 5 honorat:
1 Nequiti^m, 2 pacem, 3 crimina, 4 iura, 5 probos.
This place does, 1 hate, 2 love, 3 punish, 4 keep, 5 requite:
1 Voluptuous riot, 2 peace, 3 crimes, 4 laws, 5 th'vpright.
4 THE ECHINADES.
The ECHINADES are certain little Islands, or rather great rocks now called
Curzolari; famous for nothing but the battle of Lepanto, fought nigh the^. They
stand just against the mouth of the river A^helous.

Turbidus obiectas Achelous Echinadas exit.
Fierce Achelous with the Sea is mixed
Where the Echinades great rocks are fixed.
These Islands are in number five, and are by the Poets fained to have been so
many N^iades or sea Nymphs, whom Achelous the riuer-God upon some displeasure,
metamorphosed into these rockie Islands. But the truth is they were caused by
the dur^ and mud, which by this river carried a little into the sea, there
settled together. Alluding to which Ovid brings in the river Achelous thus
speaking.

-- fluctus nost^rque marisque
Continu^m deduxit humum, pariterque revell^t
In totidem, medij^ (quod cernis) Echinadas, vndis.
The fury of the ^ea waves and mine own
Continual heaps of earth and mud drew down:
Which parted by the inter-running seas,
Made (as thou see) those five Echinades.
5 CEPHALENIA.
CEPHALENIA lies over against Acarnania, and is in compass 166 miles. It
contained 200 towns, the chief being the havens of A^gastuli, 2 Gu^scardo,
and 3 Nollo: the chief commodities are wheat, honey, currants, powder for the
dying of Scarlet, oil, wo^ll, Turkies, etc. This Island was first called
Melena, then Teleboas, whose king Pterelaus was by Amphitrion a Theban Captain
killed in battle, and the Island made subject to Thebes: Strabo.
during the stay of Amphitrion two things happened in Greece, 1 Jupiter got his
wife Alomena with child of Hercules. 2ly, Cephalus a noble man of Athens being
in hunting, killed his wife Procris with an arrow, instead of his prey,
whereupon he fled to Amphitrion newly victorious over the Teloboans; who
pitteing his case, made him governor of this Island, called since Cephalenia,
after his name.

6 CORCYRA.
CORCYRA (now Corfu, formerly Phaeacia) so called from a virgin of that name,
whom Neptune here deflowred; is distant 12 miles from Epirus. It stretches
East and West in form of a bow, and in length is 54 miles, 24 in breadth; and
is seated co^;veniently for the Venetians, as being the center of their
Lordship by sea. The chief City is Corfu, which the Turks by their repulses
have found impregnable. For it is situate at the foot of a mountain, on the
topp of which are built two inaccessible fortresses, as being strongly fenced
with a natural rock. The one of these is called The old fortress; the other
The new; both justly esteemed the chief bulwarks of Venice, whose trade and
pote^cy would soon fail, were these forts in any others hands. For this cause
the two Captains are sworn before the Senate of Venice, never to have mutual
converse or intelligence one with the other, either in word or writing: least
by the corruption of one Captain, the other might perhaps be wrought from his
allegiance. Neither is their command there for more then two years, their
commission then terminating, and new successors being sent them. 2 Pagropoli.
3 Castello St Angelo. It is very fruitful in Wax; Honny, Wine, Oil, etc. Here
reigned Alcinous whose gardens are so memorised by the Poets. Ovid. Met.
Quid bifera Alcinoi referam pomaria? vosque
Qui nunquam vacui prodistis in aethera rami?
Why should I name Alcinous fertile ground?
And trees which never without fruit were found?
This Alcinous was he who so courteously received Ulysses after his shipwreck.

7 ITHACA.
ITHACA now called Valde Campare, lies on the Northe^st of Capha^ema; Sandi.
being in compass 50 miles; famous for the bath of Ulysses, the son of
Laertes: Effugimus scopulos Ithacae, Laertia regna:
Et terram altricom s^ui execramur Vlissis
From the Ithacan rocks, Laertes land we fled,
And cursed the soil which dire Ulysses bred.
This Island was also called Dullichium (or else there was an Island of this name
nigh unto Ithaca, whereof Ulysses was also King) from whence Ulysses is
oftentimes named Dullichius heroes among the Poets; and Dullichius vertex in
Ovid is put for Ulysses head.

Sed neque Dullichius sub Achillis casside vertex
Ponde a tanta feret.
Achilles helme's a weight too great I know
Fow weak Ulysses pate to undergo.
8 LEVCADIA.
LEVCADIA (now S. Maure) was so called of the white rocks between it and
Cephalenia. On these rocks stood a temple of Apollo, Strabo.
from whence by leaping into the sea, such as unfortunately loved were cured of
that fury. The chief city is St Maure, inhabited by Jews for the most part,
to whom Baiazel the 2d gave it, after their expulsion from Spain. This country
was once joined to the continent. Leucada continuam vetere^ habuere coloni,
Ovid. Met.

Nunc freta circumeunt.
Leucas in former times joined to the land,
Environed round with waters now does stand.
These Islands followed the Roman and Greek Empires, and was by Baldwin the
first Latin Emperor of Constantinople, allotted to the Vo^ctians; who have
ever since defended them; only this Leucadia being lost to the Turks.

Thus much of the Ionian Isles.
THE ADRIATIQVE ISLES.
THe ADRIATIQVE Sea extending 700 miles in length, and 140 in breadth; was so
called of Adria, once a famous sea Town on the mouth of ^ridanus or Poe. It was
accounted a sea wonderful unsafe and tempestuous, as appeared by the Improbo
vacundior Adria, in Horace, by the Minax Adri^^cum, in Catullas, and the
ventosi tumor Adria, in Seneca's Thi^stes. When the Empress Helena found the
Cross on which our Savior died; she made of one of the three nails by which
his Body was fastened, a reins for her son Constantines horse: of the second,
the rest of his helmet; the third she cast into this sea; since which time (as
Platina in the life of Pope Silu^ster reports out of S Ambrose) it has bin
very calm and quiet. The Venetians are the Lords of this Sea, to whom as the
Duke is espoused every Ascension day; so it is baptized by the Bishop of Zant,
every Epiphany day. The Islands of this Sea are neither many, great, nor famous;
the most pleasant are 1 the Absirtides, so called by the men of Cholcis, whom
king A^^as had sent to pursue the Argonauts, in memory of Absirtus their kings
son, whom Medea his sister had torn in pieces, before she took ship to fly
away with Jason. 2 Cherso fruitful in cattle. 3 Weggia, abounding in wood,
wines, and pul^e; it is 30 miles in compass. 4 Grissa or Pago glorying in her
salt pits, and being second for bigness in all this sea, as containing in
compass 100 miles. 5 Lesina the biggest absolutely of all the Adriati^ue in
compass 150 miles, an exceeding fertile place for the quantity. The chief
town Lesina is unwalled, and of no great beauty or bigness; but defended by a
strong fortress which command^th both the harbor, and the vessels in it. 6
Curzola, called anciently Corcyra Nigra, is sufficiently fruitful, the most
populous of all the rest, and 90 miles round. This Island Anno 1571, a little
after the taking of Cyprus, and before the battle of Lepanto, was invaded by
Vluz Ali, Knolles.
with a Navy of 60 Galleyes; for scare of whom, Co^tar^nus the Venetian
Governor, abandoned Curzola the chief town hereof, together with all the
townsmen and soldiers. The silly women thus forsaken, and preferring death
before dishonor, defended the walls, and with stone, fire, and such weapons as
they had, beat off the enemy, till a violent tempest sorced the Turkish
General to remove his galleyes to a place of more safety. 7 Zara. 8 Brazzia,
and 9 Lissa, three small Isles, all which the Turks spoiled, and carried thence
1000 Christian captives, in their retreit from Curzola. 10 Arbe the only
hauenlesse Island in the whole Sea, which defect is recompensed with its
natural pleasantness: which so entised certain dissolute rouers of Austria,
that they seized on it; and had (...) like to pluck a heavy war between the
Archduke and the Venetians; if the King of Spain had not made a pacification.
The other Islands I willingly omit, and will haste to the Mediterranean.

Thus much of the Adriatique Isles.

THE MEDITERRANEAN ISLES.
THe MEDITERRANEAN Sea, so called for that it has its course in the middle of
the earth; is called in some places Mare Tyrrhenum, in others Ligusticum, in
some Siculum, in others Sardoum, etc: and even as the Camelion applies it
self to the colors of the nighest adjacent body; so this Sea takes its
denomination from the nearest adjacent shore. These Seas are called also by
sundry modern Writers in our neighbor (...)* the Leuant seas, or the seas of
Leuant: because in respect of France, Spain* Germany, Britain, etc: they are
toward the ^ast; Leuant in the French language signifying the sunne-rising. The
chiefest Islands are the greater or lesser: the greater are 1 ^icil^e. 2 ^alta 3
Corsica. 4 Sardinia. 5 the Baleares. The less^ shall be spoken of in their due
time.

1 SICILIA.
SICILIE environed round with the sea, has in compass 7^^ m^les; and was
supposed to have bin joined to Italy, and d^uided by the fury of the waves. The
narrow seas between this and Italy, being not above a mile and a half broad,
are by Florus called, Sands.
fabulosis infa^ne mo^stris fretum, from Scylla and Charibilis, of whom so many
fabulous things are reported by (...), Chari^dis is a gulf or whirle-pit on
Sicily side, which violently attracting all vessels that come too nigh it,
deuoureth them, and casts up their wrecks at the shore of Tauronia, not far
from Cat^na. Opposite to this in Italy stands the dangerous rocko Scylla,
Strabo.
it the foot of which, many little rocks shoot out, on which the waters
strongly beating, make that noise which the Poets feign to be the barking of
dogs. The passage between these two being to unskillful mariners exceeding
periltous, gave beginning to the proverb, Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare
Charibdim,
Who seeks Charibdis for to shun,
Does oftentimes on Scylla run.


It is situate under the 4 Climate, the longest day being 13 hours and a
half. The first name was Trinacria, for that being triangular, it butteth into
the Sea with 3 Promontories, (...) 1 Pelorus (or Cape del Poro) North: 2
Pachinus (or C. Pas^^^^) West: 3 Lilibaeum (or C. Boij, or C. Coro) South. This
Lilibaeum looked toward Carthage, and was distant from the shore of Afric 180
miles. Strabo relates, that a man of a very sharp and strong sight (some
Linceus I warrant you) getting up into a watch-towre that stood on this Cape,
descried a fleet setting sail out of the haven of Carthage, and told the
Lilibitanians their bigness and number. That this is true, I dare not say; for
besides the vnlikelyhood of kenning at so great a d^stance, we are taught by
Philosophy, that the sea being of an orbicula^ form, swells it self into
the fashion of a round to^^re or h^ll, t^ll it put bound to the eyesight. From
these three corners, this country was (as we have said) called Trinacris or
Trinacria, according to that of Ovid, Terra tribus scopulis vastum procurrit in
aeq^or,
Trinacris a positu nomen adepta lo^^^.
An Island with three corners braues the maine,
And thence the name Trinacria does gain.


The first inhabitants that we find to have dwelt in this counttry, are the
huge Grants so often mentioned in the Odysses of the divine poet Homer, called
Lestrigones and Cyclopes; of which last rank was the so much (...) Poliphemus,
that with such humanity entertained Vlyss^s and his companions. These were
afterward rooted out by the Sicani a people of Spain, who called it Sicania.
As for the name of Sicilia, some derive it from Sicileus a supposed king of
Spain, who is fabled to have conquered this country: but the truth is, it came
from the Siculi, who being by Evander and his Arcadians, driven out of Latium,
came into this Island: to which, having mastred the Sicani, they left their
name. In succeeding ages there came hither diverse Colonies of the Greeks, who
planting themselves only in the coast-parts of the country; altered not the
name, by which at their coming they found it called.

The people are ingenious, Orteliu^.
eloquent and pleasant, but withal wondrous inconstant, and very talkatiue,
whence rose the proverb, Gerrae Siculae. They follow the Religion of the
Romish Church, and use the Italian language, but very much impaired and fallen
from his true elegancy; as having commixture of the Greek, Saracen, Norman,
Spanish, and French tongues. The total number of them is about one million and
300000 souls.

The soil is incredibly fruitful in Wine, Oil, Honey, Saffron, Sugar, Salt, in
Minerals of Gold, Silver, and Allom, having the gemmes of Acate, and Emralds;
with such abundance of all sorts of grain, that it was of old called the
Granarie of the Roman Empire; and now furnishes Italy, Malta, with the
adjacent Islands, Spain, and Barbary, with part of her superfluities. In this
Country is the hill Hybla, so famous for bees and honey, and the hill Aetna,
now called Montgiball, which continually sends forth continual flames of
fire, to the astonishment of a^l beholders. Into this fiery Furnace the
Philosopher Empedocles cast himself, that he might be reputed a God. -- Deus
immortalis haberi
Dum cupit Empedocles, ardentem fervidus Aetnam
Insiluit --
Empedocles to be a God desires,
And casts him self into th'Aetnean fires.
The reason of these fires is the abundance of sulphur and brimstone,
contained in the bosom of this hill; which is blown by the wind, driving in
at the chappes of the earth, as by a pair of bellows: through which chinkes
also, there is continually more fuel added to the fire, the very water
administering an operative virtue to the combust^ble matter; as we see that
water cast on coals in the Smiths forge, does make them burn more ardently.
The reason of this slain is thus set down by Ovid.

Ista b^tumineae rapiunt incendi^ vires,
Luteaque exiguis a^d^scunt sulphura flammis:
Atque ubi terra cibos alimentaque de^ ita flammae
Non dabit, absumptis, per longum viribus aev^m;
Nat^raeque suum nutrimen deerit edaci:
Non seret Aetna famem, desertaque d^seret ignes.
A rozen mould these fiery flames begin,
And ^l^yie brimstone aides the fire within.
Yet when the slymie soil consumed, shall
Yield no more food to feed the fire withal:
And Nature shall restrain her nourishment,
The flame shall cease, hating all famishment.
Under this hill some Poets feign the Giant Enceladus to have bin buried; whose
hot breath fireth the mountain, lying on his face: Others suppose it to be the
shop of Vulcan, and the Cyclops: the gross Papists hold therein to be
Purgatory.

The chief rivers are 1 Sanso. 2 Taretta. 3 Acatius, famous for its precious
stones, and 4 Arethusa, memorized by the Poets, into which the Grecian river
Alpheus, having received 140 lesser streams, and making his way under so great
a part of the Sea, is thought to arise here: as Strabo and Seneca affirm, and
sufficiently prove by the several instances of a wooden dish or cup lost in
the river Alpheus, and found rising up in this river; and by the leaves of
certain trees growing on the banks of that Greek river, and swimming on this
in great abundance, there being none of these trees in all Sicily. Dicitur
Alpb^m, (says Mela) se non consociare pelago, sed subter maria, torrasque
depressus, huc agere alveum, atque, hic se rursus extollere.

Sands.
This Island is famous for the worthy Scholars she once produced, viz:
Aeschilus, the first Tragedian of fame, who being bald through age, once w^lked
in the fields, where by chance an Eagle taking his bald pate for a white rock,
let a shell fish f^ll on it, of that bigness, that it beat out his brains. 2
Diodorus Siculus that famous historian, 3 Empedocles the first inventer of
Rhetoric, and his fellow Gorgias. 4 Euclide, the tex^u^ry Geometrician, who
taught in Megaris. 5 Archimed^s a m^st wor^^y Mathematician, Plutarch.
he was the first author of the Sphere, at which instruments he made one of
that art and bigness, that one standing within, might easily perceive the
several motions of every celestial Orb. He made also diverse mi^itary
engines, which in the siege of Syracusa, sorely vexed the Romans, and was at
last slain in his study by a common soldier, at the sack of the Town; to the
great grief of the Roman General Marcellus. 6 Epicharmus. 7 Theocritus,

Pliny reckoned in this Island 72 Cities; the chief of which were Syracusa,
containing in circuit 22 miles, the Metropolis of the whole Island, and a most
strong and flourishing Commonwealth. It was built by Archias of Corinth, who
being for an unnatural rape committed on a young Gentleman, banished his
Country, together with his friend and companion Miscellus; consulted with the
Oracle of Delphos. The Oracle demanded whether they affected rather wealth, or
health; to which when Miscellus replied health, and Archias wealth, the Oracle
directed the former to Crotona in Italy; and the latter hither. It contained in
it 4 Towns as it were, viz: I Will, Acradin, Neapolis, and Tyche, together with
the Fort Hexapyle, commanding all the rest. It was the custom of this Town,
when any of the Nobility began to grow too potent among them, to write his name
in an Olive leaf, which being put into his hand, without any further ceremony,
banished him for five years. This kind of banishment was called the Petal^sme
from (...) a lease. 2 Erix, where Venus was worshipped, and called Ericina: 3
Catina, so vexed by Dionysius tyrant of Sicily, 4 Emma, whence Pluto is said to
have stolen Proserpina. Florui.
In this town hued Syrus En^us, who stirred up the slaves of the Roman state,
to rebel against their Lords: for having broke open the common prisons, and
received all such as repaired to him, he patched up an Army of 40000 soldiers,
and was after much harm done, vanquished by Rupilius. This war the
Historians call, Bellum servile. The whole Island is now divided into 3 parts: 1
Mazara west, whose chief cities are 1 Moureal, famous for the Church and
Archbishops See: 2 Gorgenti once Agrigentum, where the tyrant Phalaris lived,
who tortured Perillus in the brazen Bull, which he made for the destruction and
torture of others: whereupon aptly Ovid. -- nec enim lex iustior ulla,
Quam necis artifices art perire sua.
Most just it is a man should be tormented,
With that which first his cruel wit invented.
3 Palermo, formerly called Panormus, a colonie of the Phenicians, and now the
chief city of Sicily, and the seat of the Spanish Viceroy: situate it is on
the West cape of the Island, ouer-against Sardinia, beautified with large
streets, delicate buildings, strong walls, and magnificent Temples. II Vallis
de Noto toward the Southeast, in which the chief cities are 1 Syracuse on the
Sea side, 2 Emma in the midland, of which already: and Leontium on the Sea
also, North of Syracusa; with which town it had always war, either for
liberty or priority. And III Mona toward the Northeast, in which the chief
towns are 1 Nicosia, in the midland: 2 Milaso on the North promontorie: and 3
Messina, just opposite to Rhezo in Italy, a town whose haven and entrances are
so strongly sconced and bulwarked, that the people let their gates (in derision
of the Turks) stand continually open. It is also an Archbishops See.

After this Island was once known to the Greeks, there came from all parts of
Greece, colonies to inhabit it, as from Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Mesene,
Megaris, and the rest: who winning upon the Natives, planted themselves in the
Country. Here in tract of time was managed a great part of the Peloponnesian
war, the Athenians siding with the Leontines; and the Spartans with the
Syracusians: in which the whole power of Athens was broken by sea and land; and
their two Captains, Nicias and Demosthenes, murdered in prison. Famous also was
this country of old, Iustine.
for the Tyrants Dionysis, the elder and the younger; for Hieron, and
Hieronymus, in whose time broke out the first Punique war, the Sicilians
calling in the Romans to expel thence the Carthaginians, which then possessed
a great part of the Island. These Tyrants, especially the last Dionysii, were so
odious, that there were continual execrations powered on them, only one old
woman prayed for the life of the latter: who being asked the cause, made
answer, that she knew his Grandfather to have bin bad; and after by prayers
they had obtained his death, his son succeeded far worse then the father:
and after their curses had also prevailed on him, came the present Tyrant,
worse then either; for whose life she was resolved to pray, l^st after his
decease, the Devil himself should come amongst them. After the Tyrants had
bin rooted out, and this Island was conquered by Marcellus; it always followed
the fortune of Naples; and together with it (when Manfroy the bastard had
forcibly made himself King of these countries) was offered to Richard Earl of
Cornwall, Camden.
brother to our Henry the 3d, a man of that riches, that he was able to spend
for ten years, an hundred marks a day, which according to those times, was no
small sum. The conditions by the Pope proposed, were so impossible for the
Earl to perform, that his Agent told the Pope, he might as well say to his
Master, I give the Moon, climb up, catch it, and take it. The Earl thus
refusing it, it was offered to the King his brother, for his second son Edmund,
who was invested by the gift of a ring, and in his name the Pope coined money,
with the inscription of Aimundus Rex Siciliae. But the King being ouer-burdened
by his Barons wars, the Pope having sucked no small store of treasure from
him; it was in the year 1261, given unto Charles Earl of Provence and Aniou,
brother to Lewis 10th. Under him those Countries jointly continued subject,
till the year 1281, in which time his competitor Peter of Arragon, promising
him to fight a single combat before our king Edward the first, at Bordeaux,
failed of his word, and in the mean time so contrived it, Hist. of Fr.
that at the sound of a bell tolling to prayers, all the Frenchmen in Sicily
were cruelly massacred; which exploit masketh now under the name of Vespe^i
Siculi: Since which time this Island has belonged to the house of Arragon.

The revenues of this kingdom are as some say but 800000 only; Bar^.
but as others say, a million of Ducats. The Arms are Arragon, two ^lanches
argent, charged with as many Eagles Sable, becked Gules. For Nobility this
Island compares with Naples, as containing in it Archbishops 3 Princes 7
Marquesses 13 Vicount 1 Bishops 9 Du^es 4 Earls 14 Barons 48


2 MALTA.
Sands.
ABout 60 miles distant from Sicil^a is the Island MALTA, in compass 60 miles;
seated upon a rock, over which the Earth spreads in height not above three
foot; so that it must needs be barren; which defect is supplied by the
Sicilian abundance: yet have they no small store of Pomgranats, cytrons,
orenges, melons, and other excellent fruits. Here is also great abundance of
cotton-wool ( Gossypium the Latinists call it) which they sow as we do corn.
The stalk is no bigger then that of wheat, but stronger and tougher, the head
round bearded, and hard as a stone, which when it is ripe, breaks, and is
delivered of a white soft bumbast, mixed with seeds; which they separate with
an instrument, selling the wool, and reserving their seed for the next
harvest. This Island is in the Scriptures called Molita, and is said to be the
place where S. Paul shook the Viper off his hand. Famous also is it for the
Council held here against Pelagius, by Pope Innocent the first, at which S.
Austine was present, and 214 Bishops. The men are of the Africane complexion
and language, following the Romish Church; the women fair, but hating company,
and going covered. The whole number of inhabitants are 20000; possessing 60
Villages, and 4 Cities. Namely 1 Valetta, built after the defeat of the
Turks, Anno 1565, and called after the name of Valetta the great Master, who
so c^uragiously withstood their fury. 2 The T^wn and Castle of S. Hermes, which
the Turks took, though they did not lon^ enjoy it. 3 Malta or Melita, so
called of the abundance of honey nigh unto it. 4 La Issula: as also the Forts of
S M^chael, and S. Angelo.

This Island was by the Spaniards taken from the Moors, and by Charles the fifth
given to the Knights of the Rhoaes, newly expelled thence by Solomon the
Magn^ficent, Ao 1^22. These knights are in number 1000; of whom 500 are always
(...) resident in the Island; the other 500 are dispersed through Christendom,
at their several Seminaries in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany: and at any
summons are to make their person^ll appearance. These Seminaries ( Alberges
they call them) are in number seven, viz: one of France in general, one of
Av^rne, one of Provence, one of Castile, one of Arragon* one of Italy; and one
o^ Germany; over every one of which they have a Grand Prior, who in the
country where he lives, is of great reputation: An eigth Seminary they had in
England, till the suppression of it by Henry the 8th: yet have they some one or
other, to whom they give the title of Grand Prior of England. Concerning the
original and riches of these Knights, we shall speak when we come into
Palestine; now a word or two only of their places, and the election of their
great Master. None are admitted into the order, but such as can bring a
testimony of their Gentry for six descents; and when the ceremonies of their
admission (which are many) are performed* they swear to defend the Church of
Rome, to obey their superiors, to live upon the revenues of their order only,
and withal to live chastely. Of these there be 16 of great authority
(Counselors of state we may call them) called, the Great Crosses, out of whom
the officers of the order, as the Marshall, the Admiral, the Chancellor, etc:
are chosen; and who, together with their Master, punish such as are co^vict of
any crime, first by degrading him, 2ly by strangling him, and 3ly by throwing
him into the sea. Now when the Great Master is dead, they suffer no vessel to
go out of this Island, till another be elected, lest the Pope should intrude on
their Election, which is performed in this manner. The several Seminaries
nominate two knights, and two are also nominated for the English: these 16 from
amongst themselves choose 8: these 8 choose a Knight, a Priest, and a Friar
servant; and they three, out of the 16 Great Crosses, elect the great Master.
The great Master being thus chosen, is styled though but a Friar, The most
illustrious, and most reverend Prince, the Lord Friar N N: Great Master of the
Hospital of S. John of Jerusalem, Prince of Malta, Gauls, and Goza: these
two last being Islands lying nigh unto Malta, the former in compass 30 miles.
Far different, I assure you, Camden.
is this title from that of the first Masters of this order, who called
themselves only, Servants to the poor seruitours of the Hospital of
Jerusalem: or that of the Master of the Templers, who was only entitled, The
humble Minister of ^he poor Knights of the Temple.

3 CORSICA.
CORSICA is situate just against (...) in the Ligurian Sea, Maginus.
it comprehends in length 120 miles; 70 in breadth, and 325 in circuit. It is
under the fifth Clime, the longest day being almost 15 hours. This Island was
first named Cyrnus, 2l^ Teracina, now Corsica, from a woman so named, who
following her Cow hither, first discovered it.

It is divided in Cismontanam, and Vitramontanam. The chief rivers of both
being G^lo and Travignano.

This Country yields excellent dogs for game, good Horses, fierce Mastifes,
and a beast called Musoli, not found in Europe, excepting this Island, and
Sardinia. They are horned like Rams, and skinned like Stags; which skin is of
such an incredible hardness, that the beast being cast headlong against a rock,
receives no hurt, but nimbly flies from his enemy to his den.

The soil is by reason of the mountains (which euery-where are too thick and
barren in it) less fruitful, Mercator.
producing corn in less plenty; but the best wines, and such as the old
Romans well rellished, in good measure. It produces also oil, sigges, raisin,
and honey; the first three in a mediocrity of goodness, the last somewhat bitter,
and by many deemed unwholesome. It abounds also with allom, box-trees,
iron-mines; and the tree called Taxus, whose poisonous berries, though in taste
pleasing; are much fed on by the bees, and therefore thought to be the cause of
the bitterness of the honey. In some few places also where the rivers have their
currents, especially toward Liguria, it recompenseth by its fertiliy in
bearing all manner of grain, the ba^rennesse of the mountains.

Pliny reckoned in it 34 Cities, or castles rather, the chief whereof at this
day are 1 Bastia, seated on the Northeast part of the Country upon a commodious
haven, where the Genoensian Governor has his residence, and a strong
garrison. 2 Nebbium, called by Ptolomy, Chersunum. 3 Mariana, now Morian; 4
Alleria, now Gallera, both Roman Colonies; the last being situate on the
Western shore of the Island, just against Bastia: and 5 Pila. The principal
havens hereof are S. Florence in the Northern part, in the midst between
Morian and Nebbio; and S. Boniface (called by Ptolomy, Portus Syracusanus) just
opposite to it in the South corner: both of good safety, and capable of the
greatest vessels.

This Island, as also its neighbors of Sicilia, and Sardinia, have bin the
tennis-balls of fortune, this being first subject to the Tyrians; Secondly to
the Carthaginians; Thirdly to the Romans; Fourthly to the Saracens. From these
the Genowaies conquered it, from them it was taken by the Pisans: but recovered
again by the Genowaies, who still enjoy it.

The people are churlish, stubborn, poor, unlearned, and use a corrupt
Italian. They are said to be the progeny of the 52 daughters of king Thespias,
who being gotten with child by Hercules in one night; were by their father put
to the mercy of the Sea; which wrought them to this Island; which they and their
posterity peopled, till the coming of the Tyrians.

Here are in this I Will

SARDINIA.
SARDINIA is South from Corsica, Ortelius.
from which it is but 7 miles distant. It is in length 180 miles, 90 in breadth,
560 in circuit: it is situate under the 4 Climate, the longest day being 14
hours.

It is fertile in respect of Corsica, barren if compared to Sicily; abundant in
Corn, deficient in Oil; well stored with all sorts of cattaile, Hist. of Sp.
as plainly appears by that plenty of cheese and hides, which are hence sent
into Italy, and other places. The horses hereof are hot, headstrong, and hard
to be broken, but they will last long: the bullocks here do naturally amble, so
that on them the country peazants use to ride as familiarly, as they do in
Spain on mules and asses. Here also is the beast Musoli, which we lately
described; of whose skin carried to Corduba, and there dressed, is ma^e our
true Cordovan leather. Finally, here is an herb, which if one eat, he shall
die with laughter; whence came the proverb, Risus Sardonicus. The truth of this
report, I will not oppugn, though it be by others more probably coniectured,
that the herb being of a poisonous nature, causes men to dye with such a
convulsion or contraction of their sinews, that they seem to grinne or laugh.

The people are small of stature, laborious, given to hunting, prone unto
rebellions, Ortelius.
wherefore the Spaniard permits neither Smith nor Cutler to live there: yet
indifferent peaceable among themselves, and in some measure courteous to
strangers. In matters of Religion they are little curious, going to Mass on
Sundays, and Saints days; which once done, they fall to dancing in the midst
of the Church, singing in the mean time, songs too immodest for an Alehouse.
Nay it is thought that their Clergy it self is the most ^ude, ignorant, and
illiterate of any people in Christendom. The language they speak, is a corrupt
Catalonian: their diet on meats common and grosse^ their apparel in the towns
(especially that of the women) gorgeous: that in the villages, base.

It is divided into two parts, viz: Cape Lugudori toward Corsica, and Cape
Cegliari toward ^fricke. Of these, when this Island was jointly under the
^isans and Genowaies; the first, being the least, and withal so mountainous
and barren, belonged to Genoa: the last being the larger, and besides, level
and fruitful, appertained to Pisa: the inequality of which division, caused
often discontents and wars between them. The principal cities are Calvaris,
built by the Pisans, and situate just opposite to Afric; inioying a goodly
haven, and much frequented by Merchants, adorned with a beautiful Temple,
stately turrets, the seat of the Viceroy; and an Ar^hiepiscopal Sec. 2 B^ssa
on the West side, an Archbishops residence also. 3 S. P^eparata on Corsica
side, and 4 Aqu^lastro on the East side. Here are in diuer^ places of this
Island, the remainders of sundry towers and forts, which the people call
Norackes, from Nora, one of the sons of Gerion, who (as they think) came
into this Country, and built the first man^^on in it.

This Island was first called Ico, then Ichnusa, next Sandaliotes, from the
resemblance^t had to the soale of a man's foot: and lastly Sardinia from Sardus,
son (as they say) to Hercules. It was first under the Iol^tenses: Secondly,
from them taken by the Carthaginians: Thirdly, by the Romans: Fourthly, by the
Saracens, Anno 807. From these last it was recovered by the Genoys and Pisans:
and because they could not agree about their bounds, Boniface the eight putting
his finger in another man's pie, gave it in see to James King of Arragon, and
his successors; who driving thence the Genowaies, made themselves absolute
Lords of it, Anno 1324. The Spanish Viceroy has (as we now said) his residence
in Caliari, who must of necessity be a Spaniard, under whom are two
Deputy-gouernours Spaniards also, one for Cape Caliari, the other for Cape
Lugudori; the other inferior officers may be of the Natives. As for the City
Caliaris it self, it is exempt from the legal jurisdiction even of the
Vice-Ro^; and is governed by a Council of its own Citizens.

The Arms of this Island are Or, a cross Gules, between four Saracens heads
Sable curled Argent. Bara.

THE BALEARES.
THese Islands were formerly called Insulae Gymnasiae, from (...), nudus,
because they use to go naked; and BALEARES from (...), ^acio, because they
were such excellent slin(...) exercise in a manner innatiue to them, the
fithers giving (...) after a convenient age no victuals, but what they could
h^t down from some high beam with a sling. They ^^e divided into Ma^or^a and
Minorca, or the greater and the l^ss^^.

Manorca is about 60 miles distant from Spain, and is 300 miles in circuit.
The chief Cities are 1 Maiorca an University. 2 Palma, where Raymundus Lullius
was borne, as much esteemed with them, as Aristotle amongst us.

Minorca is distant fram Ma^orca 9 miles, and is 150 miles in circuit: the
people were heretofore valiant, now esseminate, the soil barren in some
places, but generally fruitful. The chief Towns are 1 Minorca, and 2 Iaua.
Both these Islands did once wonderfully abound in Conies, wherewith they were so
pestred, that they not only spoiled corn and grass, Munster.
but undermined houses, and threw down walls; so that the Ilanders armed
themselves, and fought with them; but when such force prevailed not, they sent
to the Romans for aid, and there were taught the use of Ferrets.

Quade.
Nigh unto these ^al^ares are two small Islands. The 1 E^^isa is distant from the
coast of Spain 50 miles. and is 100 miles in circuit; the chief City is Tuica;
the chief commodity is salt. Ten miles hence is 2 Olhi^sa, 70 miles round,
called by the Latins, Frumentariae, They were both called Pithuisae, for their
store of Pine trees. The men, and women also, of these two Islands, and of
Panconia, or Pantalarea, an Ilet adjoining, are very good Swimmers. Biddulph in
the relation of his travels, reports, how being about these Islands becalmed,
there came a woman swimming from one of them, with a basket of fruit to sell.

These 4 Islands were added to the Rom^ns dominion by the valor of Metellus,
the brother of him who conquered Crete. The people hereof were given to
Pyracie, and seeing the Roman Navy coasting there-about, supposing them to
have bin only Merchants, assailed them: and at first gave the repulse; but the
Romans getting between them and the shore, soon forced them to an unwilling
submission. They were all won from the Romans by the Sarac^ns; Hist. of Sp.
and from them regained by Raimund Arnauld, Earl of Catelogne, and the Genoys,
Anno 1102: and being by the Genoys red^liuered to the Moors, were recovered by
James the first of Arragon 1028. He gave them to his second son, whose
posterity continued kings of those Islands, till the year 1343: in which Pedro
the fourth of Arragon, did dispossess king James, and united them to his
Crown.

THE MEDITERRANEAN ISLES. THE LESSER ISLANDS.
THE LESSER ISLANDS dispersed about in this sea, are the Vulcanian or Aeolian
Islands, the people of which being well skilled in divining from which coast the
wind would blow, gave the Poets occasion, to make Aeolus, God of the wind. They
lie all on the coast of Sicily, and are in number 11: the chief are 1 Lipara 10
miles round, from whence the rest are now called, the Lipa^ean Isles. 2 Vulcania
(of old Hiera) where Vulcan was worshipped. Florus.
Near unto these Islands was fought the first nauall battle between the Romans
and the Carthaginians, as well for the dominion of Sicily, as for the absolute
supremacy in matter of command. The Roman^ before this time never used the
Seas, as being totally employed in the conquest of Italy: insomuch that when
they had built their galleys, they exercised their men in rowing, by placing
them with oars in their hands, on two seats near the water. This
notwithstanding, having made them grappling-hookes, they so fastened the adverse
fleet unto them, that the whole fight seeming a land battle fought on the
Seas, the victory fell unto the Romans. II The Isles of Naples are 18 in number.
The chief are Ischia, 18 miles round, begirt with rocks and mountains full of
Hares and Conies: the chief Town is Ischia, Ortelius.
whither Ferdinand of Naples fled, being thrust out of his kingdom by Charles
the eight. In this Island near Cape S. Angelo, is a fountain of that heat,
that it will in short time boil any flesh or fish put into it. The second I Will
of note is Capr^ae, where the Emperors of Rom^ used to retire for their
recreation, and which Tiberius kept Court in, when he had withdrawn himself
from Rome, the better to exercise his abominable lusts. The third I Will of note
is Aenaria. III The Ligurian Islands, the chief of which are Elba or Ilua, whose
Metropolis is Cosmop^lis, built by Cosmodi Medices, D. of Florence; Here is
abundance of Iron of that nature, that it will by no means melt in the Island,
but must be carried to some other place. The second is Gallinaria, so called
from the abundance of wild Hens. And the third is Giglio, where the Genoys
overthrew the whole power of the Pisa^^.

At the Western end of this sea, is the straight called of old F^etum
^^ereu^^um, b^^ause Hercules here made a passage through the (...) let the
^^ce^n into the Mediterranean. On the North side (...) ^his str^ight was mount
Calpe; on the South mount (...) on w^i^h ^ercu^e^ placed his (so memorized)
pillars, with the inscript on of Nil vltra, in that there was the most western
bound of the world. But Charles the fifth after the discovery of Am^^ica,
coming that way; caused Plus vltra to be engraven either on the old pillars,
or else one new erected in their places This straight is now named the straight
of G^^raltar, Hist. of Sp.
from Gibal Tariff, one of the principal leaders of the Moors into Spain.
Somewhat without the mouth of this straight is the Island Gades or Cales,
peopled by the Tyrians 56^ years before the birth of Christ. Here was a Temple
consecrated to the honor of that great trauellour Hercules, in which all
seafaring men when they came hither used to pay their vows and offer
sacrifice, as having arrived at the utmost part of the world. It was once
called Tartessa, and is in length 13 miles, and has of late been the Magazin
of the ^paniards warlike munition. It was taken in one day by the English under
the conduct of Charles Earl of Nottingham, Robert Earl of Essex, and Sir
Walter Rawleigh. In this day they burned the Indian fleet, consisting of 40
ships, whose lading was worth eight millions of Crowns; they overcame the
Spanish Fleet, composed of 57 men of war: they took the St Andrew and the St
Michael two great Galleons with their luggage: they spoiled and carried away
more martial furniture then could be supplied in many years: they surprised
the Town, and in it beside private m^n and their goods, they slew and took
prisoners 4000 foot, and 600 horse, Canid. Rem.
Anno 1596. The fortunacy of this enterprise gave occasion to one of the wits
the^ living to frame this excellent Anagram on the name of that Earl of Essex,
viz: Deureux, Vere Dux: which he afterward cast into this distich.

Vere dux Deureux, and verior Hercule: Gades
Nam s^mel (...): vicit and ille si^^^l.
Alcides yields to Deuereux: he did see
Thy beauties (Cales) but Deuereux conquered thee.
Thus much of the Medite^ranean Isles.
THE ISLES OF THE OCEAN.
ANd now we are come into the OCEAN, that ingens and infinitum pelagus, as Mela
calls it: in comparison of which the Seas before mentioned are but as Ponds
or Gullets: a sea in former times known more by fame then trial, and rather
wondered at on the shore side, then any more remote place of it. The Romans
ventured not on it with their vessels (unless in the passage from France to
Britain) and much famed is Alexander for his hazardous voyage on this unruly
Sea, he having sailed in all but 400 furlongs from the shore, The name and
pedigree take here both from the Poets and Etymologists. The Poets make Oceanus
to be the son of Coelum and Vesta, or of heaven and earth. They termed him
the father of all things as Oc^anumque patrem rerum in Virgil, because moisture
was necessarily required to the constitution of all bodies, and usually painted
him with a bulls head on his shoulders (whence Euripides calls him (...)
Oceanus Tauriceps) from the bellowing and fury of the winds, which from it come
to the shore, and to which it is subject. As for the children attributed unto
him, they are doubtless nothing but the clouds and vapors thence arising. The
name of (...); Oceanus some derive from (...) celer, because of its swiftness;
some from (...) findo, diuido; because it cleaves and interlaceth the earth:
and others make it (...) quasi (...), a celeriter fluendo, which agrees in
meaning with the first. Particular names it has diverse according to the name
of the shore, by which it passes as Cantabricus, Gallicus, Britannicus, etc.
The chief Isles of it are 1 those of Zeland, which we have already described.
2ly those in the British: and 3ly those in the northern Seas.

THE BRITISH ISLANDS.
The BRITISH ISLANDS are either the Greater Britain which is divided into
England. Wales. Scotland.
Ireland
Lesser are the 1 Orchades. 2 Hebrides. 3 Sorlinges. and 4 Sporades.



BRITAIN.
TO speak much of BRITAIN, I hold in a manner superfluous, it being our
home, and we therefore no strangers to it. Yet as Mela says of Italy, De
Italia magis quia ordo exigit, quam quia monstrari eget, pauca dicentur; no^a
sunt omnia: The like I say of Britain; it is so obuious to our sight that we
need not the spectacles of letters: yet some things shall be said rather for
methods sake, then necessity. To omit therefore the diuerfe Etimons of
BRITAIN, produced according to the fantasies of several men, and omitting
Bru^^^ whose coming into and denominating this Island, is rather a fabulous
report, then a well grounded historical truth: I will take the Etymology of
M. Camden, as most probable, who fetching it from the British language;
deriueth it from Brit, signifying painting, and Tayne, signifying a nation:
which agrees not only with the British tongue, but with the records of the
most sincere and trusty Historiographers; all with one consent, affirming, that
the Britains used to paint themselves, to make them show more terrible to the
enemy. For that there was no such Brutus, is evident, 1 by the newness of his
birth; Geofrie of Monmouth, who lived in the days of Henry the 2d, being his
first father. 2ly By the silence of the Roman histories, in which it had been
an unpardonable negligence, to have omitted an accident so remarkable, as the
killing of a father by his son, and the erecting of a new Trojan Empire in
Britain. 3ly By the arguments which Caesar uses to prove them to be derived
from the Gauls; as speech, laws, customs, disposition, structure, and the
like. 4ly by the testimony of all the Roman writers, who affirm the Britains
to have been distracted into many petty royalties, and not to be under the
command of any one Prince: Summa belli administrandi communi consensu permissa
est Cassivella^no, says Caesar: Dum singuli pugnaban, vincebantur omnes, says
Tacitus and so the rest: and 5ly by the ignorance among all old writers of
their first original, Qui mortales initio coluerint parum comportum est, as
the same Tacitus.

This Queen of Islands is in compass 1836 miles; being absolutely the greatest
in the whole world, except Iaua. This most spacious country extending 800
miles in length, is under the 9th and 13th Climates of the Northern temperate
Zone; Insomuch that at the summer solstice, in the Northern parts of Scotland,
there is no night at all; but only an obscure twilight.

It is divided into England, Wales, and Scotland.

ENGLAND.
ENGLAND is bounded on the East with the German, on the West with the Irish,
Camden.
on the South with the British Oceans, on the North with the river Tweed, and
a line drawn from it to the Solwa^ westward. In former times the Northern
limit was a wall built cross the Island from Carlisle in Cumberland, to the
river Tine. This same wall was built by Severus the Emperor for a fortress
against the Picts: at every miles end was a Castle, between every Castle many
watch-towres; and through the walls of every Town and Castle, was conveyed a
pipe of brasle; which from one Garrison to another conveied the least noise
without interruption: so that the news of an approaching enemy was quickly
divulged over the borders, and resistance made accordingly. In after times
instead of this wall, the strong Towns of Berwicke and Carlisle were the chief
bars by which we kept the back-dore sh^t: and as for other forts, we had
scarce any in all the frontire parts of the kingdom. Within the heart of the
land there were indeed too many, which being in the hands of subjects, was no
small encouragement to their often rebellions, and no little incombrance in
quenching them to the Kings: until toward the end of the reign of K. Stephen,
1100 of them were laid level with the ground, and the few which remained were
dismantled and made unserviceable. This care was taken to disable the Lords and
Commons at home: but for keeping the Seacoasts from foreign enemies, little
or no care was taken. The dangerous rocks and steep cliffes were accounted a
strength sufficient. Only the Castle of Dover, and a few of the like pieces
were well fortified and furnished, as well for the safety of the land, as the
command of the sea. Afterward in the year 1539 Henry the eight having shaken
off the Romish tyranny, and seeing how the Emperor Charles was offended for
the divorce of his aunt, the Queen Katharine; how the French King had married
his son to the Popes Niece, and his daughter to the King of Scotland: thought
it best to provide for himself and his people. For this cause he built in all
places where the shore was plain and open, Castles, platformes, and
block^^^ses: which in this time of long peace are much neglected, and in part
ruined. His daughter Eliz^beth of happy memory, provided yet better for her
kingdom. For she not only new so ^^^ed Portesmouth, and placed in it a strong
Garrison; but walled our Island round, with a most stately, royal, and
invincible navy; with which she always commanded the Seas, and vanquished the
mightiest Monarch of Europe; whereas her predecessors in their sea-battailes
for the most part, hired their Men of war, from the Hantsmen, and Genowaies.
Yet did neither of these erect any Castles in the inward parts of the realm,
herein imitating nature, who fortifieth the head and feet only, not the middle
of beasts: or some Captain of a fort, who plants all his ordinances on the
walls, bulwarks, and out-workes; leaving the rest as by these sufficiently
guarded.

The whole Island was once called Albion, not from the Giant Albion, but ab
albis rupibus, the white rocks toward France. Afterward it was called
Britain, which name continued till the time of Egbert the first Saxon
Monarch, who called the Southern part of the Island, England: from the Angles,
who with the Iu^^ and Saxons, conquered it. It is in length 320 miles; enjoying
a soil equally participating of ground fit for tillage and pasture: yet to
pasture more then tillage are our people addicted, as a course of life not
requiring so many helpers, which must be all sed and paid; and yet yielding
more certain profit. Hence in former times husbandry began to be neglected
Villages depopulated, and hindes, for want of entertainment, to turn
way-beaters: whereof St Thomas Moore in his Vtopia complains saying, that our
flocks of sheep had devoured not only men, but whole houses and Towns. Oves
(says he) quae tam mites esse, tamque exiguo solent ali; nunc tam edaces and
indomitae esse coeperunt, vt homines devore^t ipsos; agros, domos, oppida
vastent, ac d^populentur. To prevent this mischief there was a statute made in
the 4th year of Henry the seventh, against the converting of errable land into
pasture ground: by which course husbandry was again revived, and the soil
made so abounding in corn, that a dear year is seldom heard of. Our Vines
are nipped with the cold, and seldom come to maturity, and are more used for
the pleasantness of the shaddowe, then for the hopes of wines. Most of her
other plenties, and ornaments, are expressed in this verse. Anglia, Mons, Pons,
Fons, Ecclesia, Faemina, Lana.
England is stored with Mountains, Bridges, Wool,
With Churches, Rivers, Women beautiful.
To omit the ^ills, here and there lifting up their heads above the pleasant
Valleys: the Bridges are in number 857: the chief of which are the bridge of
Rochester over Medway; the bridge of Bristoll over Auon; and the bridge of
London over Thames. This latter standing upon 19 Arches, of wonderful strength
and largeness; supporteth continual ranges of building, seeming rather a
street then a bridge: and is not to be paralleled with any Bridge of Europe.

The Rivers of this Country are in number 325. The chief is Thamisis,
compounded of the two rivers Them and Isis; whereof the former rising somewhat
beyond Tame in Buckinghamshiere, and the latter beyond Cirencester in
Glocestershiere, meet together about Dorcester in Oxfordshiere; the issue of
which happy conjunction is the Thamisis or Thames. Hence it flies through
Berks, Buck: Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and Essex; and so weddeth himself with
the Kentish Medway, in the very jaws of the Ocean. This glorious river seeleth
the violence of the Sea more then any river in Europe, ebbing and flowing twice
a day more then 60 miles: along whose banks are so many fair Towns and
princely palaces, that a German Poet thus truly spoke.

Tot campos, sylvas, tot regia tecta, tot hortos
Artifici excultos dextra, tot videmus arcei;
Vt nunc Ausonio Thamisis cum Tibride certet.
We saw so many woods, and princely Bowres,
Sweet Fields, brave Palaces, and stately Towers,
So many Gardens dressed with curious care,
That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.
The second River of note is Sabrina or Severne. It has its beginning in
Plinlimmon hill in Mount gommeryshire, and his end about 7 miles from Bristoll:
washing in the mean space the walls of Shrewsbury, Worcester, and Gloucester. 3
Trent, so called for that 30 kinds of fishes are found in it, or that it
receaueth 30 lesser riuerets: who having his fountain in Staffordshire, and
gliding through the Counties of Nottingham, Lincoln, Leicester, and York;
augmenteth the turbulent current of Humber, the most violent stream of the
whole I Will. This Humber, is not, to say truth, a distinct river, having a spring
head of his own; but rather is the mouth or aestuarium of diverse rivers here
consluent and meeting together, namely Dun, Arc, Warf^, Your, Darwent and
especially Ouse and Trent. And as the Daenowe having received into its channel
the rivers Dravus, Savus, Tibiscus, and diverse others, changes his name into
Ister: so also the Trent receiving and meeting the waters abouenamed, changes
his name into this of Humber; Abios the old Geographers call it. 4 Medway a
Kent^sh river, famous for harboring the royal navy. 5 Tweed the Northeast
bound of England, on whose Northern bank is seated the strong and impregnable
Town of Barwicke* 6 Tine, famous for Newcastle and her inexhaustible
Coale-pits. These and the rest of principal note are thus comprehended in one
of Mr Draytons Sonnets.

Our floods Queen Thames; for ships and swans is crowned,
And stately Severne for her shore is praised;
The Cristall Trent for foords and fish renowned;
And Avons fame to Albions cliffes is raised;
Carlegion Chester vants her holy Dee;
York many wonders of her Owse can tell;
The Peake her Dove whose banks so fertile be;
And Kent will say her Medway does excel;
Cotswall commends her Isis to the Tame;
Our Northern borders boast of Tweeds fair s^ood
Our Western parts extol their Willies fame
And the old Lea bragges of the Danish blood.
The Churches before the general suppression of Abbeys, and spoiling the
Church ornaments, were most exquisite. The chief remaining are 1 the Church of
S. Paul, founded by Ethelbert K. of Kent, in the place where once was a Temple
consecrated to Diana: the Steeple of this Church was 534 foot high, and was
twice fired by lightning. 2 S. Peter's, or the Church of Westminster, the
Chapel whereof is the most accurate building in Europe. 3 The Cathedral
Church of Lincoln. 4 For a private parish Church, that of Ratcliffe in
Bristoll. 5 For a private Chapel that of Kings College in Cambridge; 6 For the
curious workmanship of the glass, that of Christ church in Canterbury: For the
exquisite beauty of the fronts, those of Wells and Peterborough 8 For a
pleasant lightsome Church, the Abbey Church at Bath. 9 For an ancient and
reverent fabric, the Minster of York: and 10 to comprehend the rest in one,
our Lady Church in Salisbury of which, this is true, Mira canam, soles quot

ferunt, aede fenestra micat.
Marmoreasque tenet fusas tot ab a^te columna,
Comprensas horas quot vagus annus habet:
Tot gaudet portis, quot mensibus annus abundat:
Res mira, at v^ra res celebrata fide.
How many days in one whole year there be,
So many windows in one Church we see;
So many marble pillars there appear,
As there are hours throughout the flitting year;
So many Gates as moons one year does view:
Strange tale to tell, yet not so strange as true.


Our Women questionless are the most choice works of nature, adorned with all
beauteous perfection, without the addition of adulterat sophistications.
Morison.
In an absolute woman, say the Italians, are required the parts of a Dutch
woman, from the girdle downward; the parts of a French woman, from the girdle
to the shoulders; over which must be placed an English face. As their beauty,
so also their prerogatives are the greatest of any nation; neither so servilely
submisse as the French, nor so iealously guarded as the Italian; but keeping so
true a decorum: that England, as it is termed the purgatory of Servants, and
the hell of Horses; so it is acknowledged the Paradise of Women. And it is a
common byword among the Italians, that if there were a bridge built over the
narrow seas, all the women of Europe would run into England. For here they
have the upper hand in the streets; the upper place at the table; the thirds of
their husbands estates; and their equal shares in all lands, yea even such as
are holden in knights service; privileges wherewith other women are not
acquainted.

The Wool of England is of exceeding finenesse, especially that of Cotswold in
Glocestershire; that of Lemster in Herefordshiere; and of the I Will of Wight: Of
this wool are made excellent broad clothes, dispersed all over the world,
especially high Germany, Muscovie, Turkey, and Persia; to the great benefit of
the Realm: as well in return of so much money which is made of them; as in
setting to work so many poor people, who from it receive sustenance. Before
the time of King Edward the third, Engl^shmen either had not the art, or
neglected the use of making clothes: in which times our wool was transported
unwrought. And as his successors have laid impositions on every cloth sold
out of the realm; so his predecessors had, as their occasions required, some
certain customs granted on every sack of wool. In the beginning of this
Edwards wars with France, the cities and towns of Flanders, being then even
to admiration rich, combined with him and aided him in his wars there. And he
for his part by the composition then made was to give them 14000 pounds ready
money; to aid them by Sea and land if need required; and to make Bruges, then a
great mart town of Christendom, the St^ple for his woolls. Here the staple
continued 15 years, at which time the Flemmings having broke off from the
K^ng^ and he having by experience seen what the benefit of these Staples were;
removed them from Bruges into England. And for the ease as well of his subjects
in bringing their wools unto the ports, as of such foreign merchants as came
to buy, he placed his Staples at Excester, Bristoll, Winchester, Westminster,
Chichester, Canterbury, Norwich, Lincoln, York and Newcastle, for England: at
Ca^rmardin for Wales: and at Dublin, Waterford, Cork, and Tredah, for Ireland.
He further enacted that no English, Irish, or Wel^hmen should transport this
stapled commodity; no not by licenses (if any such should be granted) on pain
of confiscation, and imprisonment during the Kings pleasure. Lastly he allured
over hither diverse Flemmings which taught our men the making of clothes (who
are now grown the best cloathworkers in the world:) and to encourage men in
this art, it was by a statute made the 27th of Edward the 3d, enacted to be
felony, to carry any wools unwrought. When England had for some short time
inioyed the benefit of these Staples, the King removed them to Calice, which
he had conquered and desired to make wealthy. From hence they were at
several times and occasions translated, now to one, now to another town in
Belgia: and still happy was that town in what Country soever, where the
English kept a house for this traffic* the confluence of al people thither to
buy, infinitely enriching it. Antwerp in Brabant long enjoyed the English
Merchants, till upon some discontents between K. Henry the 7th, and Maximilian
Archduke, Martyn.
and Lord of Belgia; they removed: but at their return again were received by
the Antwerpians, with solemn processions, princely triumphs, sumptuous
feastings, rare banquetings, and expressions of much love, but more joy. And
the giving of some Cotswold sheep by K. Edward the 4th to Henry of Castile,
and John of Arragon, Anno 1465: is counted one of the greatest preiudices that
ever happened to this kingdom. The English house is now at Stoade, being by
reason of the wars in these parts, removed from Antwerpe.

The wool transported brings into the kingdom no less then 1500000l, and
the Lead half that sum; so that Lewis Guicciardine reports, that before
the wars of the Low Countries, the Flemmings and the English bartered wares
yearly, for 12 millions of Crowns.

The Author of the former verse might have added our Parks Mines, and Beer. Of
the former there are more in England then in all E^rope besides; but sp^ciatim
we have Chases 30* Forests 55; and 745 Parkes, replenished with abundance of
game.

The Mines are either of Coal, or T^nne, Lead, and such mettle: the former
chiefly enrich Newcastle in Northumberland; the latter especially Cornwall,
where they digg T^nne not much infe^iour to silver for finenesse.

Wines, as is said, we have none, but Beer abundantly, which without
controversy is a most wholesome and nourishing beuerage: which being
transported into France, Belgia, and Germany, by the working of the Sea, is so
purged; that it is amongst them in high estimation, celebrated by the name of
La bonne Beer d' Anglet^rre. And as for the old drink of England, Ale, which
comes from the Danish word Oela; it is questionless in it self (and without
that commixture which some are accused to use with it) a very wholesome drink:
howeuer it pleased a Poet in the time of Henry the third, thus to descant on
it. Nescio ^uod monstrum Stygiae conform paludi,
Ceruisiam plerique vocant: nil spissius illa
Cum bibitur, nil clarius est dum mingitur; vnde
Constat, qu^d mulias faeces in ventre relinquit.
Of this strange drink so like the Stygian lake,
Men call it Ale, I know not what to make:
Folk drink it thick, and vent it passing thin:
Much dregs therefore must needs remain within.
Neither will I quite omit our Bells, of which we have so many rings, and so
tunable, which being well guided make excellent melody; that I have heard
Forrainers call our Country the Ranging Island.

It was a tradition of old writers that England bred no Wolves neither would
they live here; which report is not consentaneous to truth: here being once
store of them, till Edgar K. of England impo^ed on Idwallo Prince of Wales, the
yearly tribute of 300 Wolves: by which means they were quite rooted out.

The Air of this Country is very temperate, neither so hot as France and
Spain in the Summer, because of its northernly situation; nor so cold in the
Winter, because the air of this kingdom being gross, cannot so soon
penetrat, as the thin air of France and Spain. And also it is here more
hot then there, because the winds participating of the Seas over which they
pass unto us, do carry with them a temperat warmth.

But if warmth were all the benefit we received from the seas, it might indeed
be said, that we were come from Gods blessing, into the warm Sun: but it is
not so. For there are no seas in Europe tha^ yield more plenty of fish then
ours. Our oysters were famous in the times of the old Romans; and our herrings
are now very beneficial unto the Netherlanders: to whom the Engl^shmen
reserving to themselves a kind of royalty; (for the Dutch by custom demand
liberty to fish of Scarbourgh castle in Yorkshire) have yielded up the
commodities. By which those States are exc^edingly enriched, and our Nation
much impouerished, and condemned for laziness and sloth: Besides, the loss of
employment for many men, who using this trade, might be as it were, a Seminary
of good and able mariners, as well for the wars, as for further navigations;
cannot but be very prejudicial to the strength and flourishing of our
Commonwealth and Empire.

The Nobility of this Country is not of so much unlimited power, as they are
(to the prejudice of the Commonwealth) in other Countries: the names of Earls,
Lords, and Marquesses, being merely titular; whereas in other places they have
some absolute, some mixed government; so that upon any little distaste, they will
stand on their own guard, and slight the power of their Sovereign. The
Commonalty enjoy a multitude of prerogatives above all other Nations, being
most free from taxes, and burdenous impositions. They have twice in a year (a
laudable custom, no where else to be seen) justice administered even at their
own doors; by the Itinerary Judges of the kingdom: an order first instituted
by Henry the second; who was also the first instituter of our high Court of
Parliament, which being an Amovin, he learned in France. They live together
with Gentlemen in Villages and Towns, which makes them savor of ciu^lity and
good manners, and live in far gre^ter reputation then the Yeomen of Italy,
Spain, France, or Germany, being able to entertain a stranger honestly, diet
him plentifully, and lodge him neatly.

The Clergy was once of infinite riches, as appears by that Bill preferred
to K. Henry the fifth of the temporal revenue, of the Church: which were able
to maintain 15 Earls, 1500 Knights, 6000 men of Arms; more then 1000
Almes-houses, and the King also might clearly put up 20000 pounds. As they now
are not so rich, so are they far more learned, and of more sincere and goodly
carriage, where^n they give place to no Clergy in the world; and for learning
I dare say, cannot be any where paralleled: neither are they so destitute of
the external gifts of fortune, but that they are the richest of the Mi^isters
o^ the Reformed Churches. For besides 5439 Parochial Benefices, being no
impropriations; and besides the Vicarages, every of which exceed the
competencie beyond seas: here are in England 26 Deanries, Camden.
60 Archdeaconries, and 544 dignities and Prebends; all of which are places of
a fair revenue. And as for the main^^nance of Priests, Monks, and Friars
before the reformation^ there were reckoned 90 Colleges, besides those in the
Universities; 110 hospitals, 2374 Chanteries and free Chapels: and 645 Abbeyes
and Monasteries: more then half of which, had above the yearly income of 200
pounds in old rents. So studious were our Ancestors both in those times of
blindness, and those of a clearer sight, to encourage men to learning, and then
to reward it.

The diet of England is for the most part flesh. In London only there are no
fewer then 67500 beefes, and 675000 sheep slain and uttered in a year,
besides calves, lambs, hogs-flesh, and poulterers ware. To prove this, suppose
there be in London 60 butchers, free of the city; whereof every one, one with
another, kills an ox aday; for so they are, and so at least they do. Then
reckon (as the London butchers affirm) that the forreiners of the suburbs and
villages, sell ^oure for their one. Lastly, count for every ox 10 sheep (for
this is also certainly known) to be killed and sold, and you have both the
numbers aboue-mentioned. The Earl of Gondamor, late the Spanish Le^ger here,
having in some several market days seem the several shambles of this great
city; said to them who had made the discovery with him, that there was more
flesh eaten in a month in that town, then in all Spain in a year. Now had I
his skill, who by the length of Hercules foot, found out the proportion of his
whole body: I might by this provision of flesh: consumed in the head, ^uesse at
the quantity of that which is spent in the body of the Realm. But this I leave
to proportionists.

The Soldiery of England is either for the land or for the (...). Our
victories by land are most apparent, over the Irish, (...) Turks, and
especially French; whose kingdom has bin ^ore shaken by the English many
times, especially twice, by King Edward the third, Hist. of Fr.
and Henry the fifth: this latter making so absolute a Conquest, that Charles
the seventh (like a poor Roy ^^ ^v^lot) confined himself to Bourges; where
having casheerd his retinue, he was found in a little chamber at supper, with a
^apkin laid before him, a rump of mutton, and two chickens. And so redoubted,
even after our expulsion from France, (our (...) dissentions rather causing
that expulsion, then the French v^lour) was the English name in that Country:
that in the (...) between King Charles the 8th, and the Duke of Britain, the
Duke to strike a terror in his enemies, apparailed 1500 of (...) own subjects,
in the Arms and Cross of England. But as (...), when he had on the Lions
skin, was for all that but an Ass, and no Lion: So these Britons by the
weak resistance they made against their enemies, showed that they were indeed
Bri^on^, and no Englishmen. Spain also tasted the valor of our
^and-souldiers, when John of Gaunt pursuing his title to Spain; (...) seat
home with 8 wagons, laden with gold, and an annual p^nsion of 10000 marks: as
also when the Black Prince re^^^^lished King Pe^er in his throne^. And then
also did they acknowledge, though they felt not the puissance of the English,
when Fernando the Catholic surprised the kingdom of Navarre. For there were
then in Fontarabia in Biscay, 6000 English ^oo^, who lay there to join with
this Ferdinando, in an expedition against France: Concerning which,
Gu^isia^dine gives this Item, that the Kingdom of Navarre was yielded rather
for the fear and reputation of the English forces that were at hand; then by
any puissance of the King of Arragon. Since those times the Spaniards much
esteemed us, as appears by this speech of theirs to our Soldiers at the
siege of Amiens. You are tall soldiers, and therefore when you come down to
the trenches, we d^uble our guards, and lo^ke for blows: but as for those
base and cowardly French, View of Fr.
when they come, we make account we have nothing to do, but play, or sleep on
our Ramparts. The like the Netherlanders can testify, only this is the grie^e
of it: The English are like Pirrhus king of Epirns, fortunate to conquer
kingdoms, but unfortunate to keep them.

Our sea-forces may most evidently be perceived in the battle of Scluse,
wherein King Edward the third with 200 ships, overcame the French fleet
consisting of 400 sail; of which he sunk 200, and slew 30000 Soldiers:
Secondly, at the battle in 88, where a few of the Q. ships vanquished the
Invincible Armado of the King of Spain, consisting of 134 great Galleons and
ships of extraordinary big^es. Sr Francis Drake with 4 ships, took from the
Spaniards, one million, and 189200 Ducats in one voyage, Anno 1587; and again
with 25 ships, he awed the Ocean, sacked S. Iago, S. Dominico, and Cartagena,
carrying away with him, besides treasure, 240 pieces of ordinance. I omit the
circumnavigation of the whole world thrice by this Drake, and Cauendish; the
voyage to Cales: as also how one of the Q. ships, named the Revenge, in which
Sr Rich. Gr^nvill was Captain, with 180 soldiers (whereof 90 were sick on the
ballast) maintained a Sea Fight for 24 hours, against above 50 of the Spanish
Galleons; and though at last after her powder was spent to the last battle,
she yielded on honorable terms, yet was she never brough^ into Spain; but
had killed more then 1000 Soldiers; and sunk 4 of their greatest vessels. I
omit also the discovery of the Northern passages by Hugh Willoughby, Dauis,
and Frobisher; concluding with that of Keckerman, Hoc certum est, omnibus hodie
gentibus naviga^di industria and peritia superiores esse Anglos, and post
Anglos, Holland^s: though now I know not by what neglect and disco^tinuance of
these honorable employments, the Hollanders begin to bereave us of our ancient
glories, and account themselves Lords of the Seas.

The English are commonly of a comely feature, gracious countenance, for the
most part gray-eyed, pleasant, beautiful, bountiful, Pol. Virg.
courteous, and much resembling the Italians in habit, and pronunciation. In
matters of war (as we have already proved) they are both able to endure, and
resolute to undertake the hardest enterprises: in peace quiet, and not
quarrelsome; in advice or counsel, sound and speedy. Finally, they are active,
hearty, and cheerful. And yet I know a Gentleman (whose name for his own
credit sake I forbear) who upon the strength of two years travel in France,
grew so vnenglished, and so affected or besotted rather on the French Nation;
that he has not spared diverse times at an open table to say, that the English
in respect of the French, were a heavy, dull, and flegmaticke people; of no
dispatch, no mettle, no conceit, no audacity, and I know not what not. A
vanity, in a man that is reputed so generally learned and accomplished,
meriting rather my pity, then my anger. Perhaps in vilifying his own Nation,
he had consulted with Julius Scaliger, who in the 16 Chapter of his third book
de re poe^^^^, gives of the two most noble Nations, English and Scottish, thi^
base and unmanly character. Gothi belluae, Scoti non minus: Angli, perfidi,
inflati, feri, contemptores, stolidi, amentes, inertes, inhospi^ales, immanes.
His bolt, you see, is soon shot, and so you may happily guess what the Archer
was, a man indeed of an able learning; but of his own worth so conceited, that
if his too much learning made him not mad; yet it made him by much too
perempto^y and arrogant. To revenge a National disgrace on a personal, is an
ignoble victory; besides, Socrates resolution in the like kind in my opinion,
was very judicious, (...); if an Ass kick us, we must not put him in the
court. To confute his censure in every point, would be to him too great an
honor, and to me too great a labor; it being a task which of it self would
require a volume. The best is, many shoulders make the burden light; and other
Nations are as deeply engaged in this quarrel against that proud man, as ours:
for so maliciously has he there taxed all other people, that that Chapter
might more properly have bin placed among his Hypercritickes.

How the English, Netherlanders, and Germans, which of all Nations are thought
most given to their bellies; do agree and differ in this property, the same
Scal^ger has showed us in this Epigram: Tres sunt convivae, Germanus, Flander,
and Anglus:
Dic quis edat melius, quis meliusve bibat.
Non comedis Germane, bibis: tu non bibis Angle,
Sed comedis: comedis Flandre, ^ibisque been.
Dutch, Flemming, English, are your only guests,
Which of these three does drink or eat the best?
The English love most to eat, the Dutch to swill,
Only the Flemming eats and drinks his fill.
Thus was it not long since with our Nation; but now I fear that the English
have, though not changed with the Flemmings, yet borrowed a little more then
needs of their quality.

That the English language is a decompound of Dutch, French, and Latin, I hold
rather to add, then to detract from its praises: since out of every language
she has c^lled the best and most significant words, and participateth equally
of their perfections, their imperfections rejected; as being neither so
boistious as the Germane, nor effeminate as the French; yet as significant as
the Latin, and far more happy in the conjunction or union of many words
together.

The Christian Religion was first planted here, say some, by S. Peter and Paul;
others suppose by Joseph of Arimathea, whose body they absolutely affirm to be
buried in Glassenbury in Somers^tshire. Howsoever, certain it is, that Lucius
King of Britain, who was the first christened king of Europe, sent Anno 180 or
thereabout, to Eleutherius Bishop of Rome, for some Ministers, if not to plant
yet to confirm the Gospel. Yet it is not a fabulous vanity, to say that
Austin first preached the Gospel here; for this is not to be understood
absolutely, that he first preached it; but that he first preached it to the
Saxons, who having driven the Britains into Wales, followed their Paga^ish
superstition. Camd. Rem.
It happened then that Gregory the Great, seeing some English boys to be sold
in the market at Rome, asked what they were: and answer was made, that they
were called Aueli; well may they so be called, said he, for they seem Angeli:
again he asked of what Province they were, and it being answered, of Deira;
Ergo, said he, de ira Dei sunt liberandi: and lastly understanding that their
King was named All; how fitly quoth he, may he sing Alleluiah unto the most
High: and on this occasion, Gregory sent Austin to convert the English Saxons,
Anno 600.

After the Popes traditions had long annihilated the worth of the Scriptures,
it pleased God to stir up Luther and the rest, to endeavor a reformation;
which in other Countries received tumultuously, was here entertained with
mature deliberation; the English bearing respect neither to Luther, Zwinglius,
not Calvin, as to the square of their faith; but abolishing such things as were
dissonant to Gods word, retained such ceremonies, as without offense the
liberty of the Church might establish. Wherein certainly they dealt more
advisedly then their neighbors, who in mere detestation of the Romish Church,
abrogated such things altogether, which their abuse had defiled, though never
so decent; and allowed in the Primitive Church. And no doubt, had the reformed
part continued an allowed correspondency in some circumstances, with the Romish
Church, a^ the Church of England does now, it had bin far greater. I have
heard it reported, that when Peter du Moulin that great light of the Church of
France, heard how indiscreetly some of our English Clergy had silenced
themselves, because they would not wear the cap and surplisse; he replied,
that would the King of France give him a general license to preach in Paris,
though it were in a fools coat, he would most willingly accept the condition;
adding withal, that he would never for any ceremony, deprive the Church of
those gifts, wherewith God had blessed him. A resolution worthy him that spoke
it.

Our Church-gouernment is as that of the Primitive Church by Archbish^ps and
Bishops, which though inveighed against by the zealously superstitious
Browni^ts; yet it is most absolute and perfect: and wonder it is how Calvin's
Presbytery made only to content the Citizens of Geneva, without any blemish
found in the order of Bishops, was so headily received, and is as importunately
desired.

The most valorous Soldiers of this Nation, were Brennus, who conducted the
Gauls into Rome: 2 Cassibilane, who twice repulsed the Roman Legions from the
British shore, and had not treason undermined his proceedings, he had the
third time and ever after done the like. 3 Constantine the Great, founder of
the Constantinopolitan Empire. 4 Arthur, chief of the 9 Worthies. 5 William
the Conqueror. 6 Richard the first. 7 Edward the third. 8 Henry the fifth. 9

Rationale Diuinorum.
The most worthy Scholars were, Bid, for his learning surnamed Venerabilis:
which attribute he purchased, when being blind, his boy guided him to preach
among a company of stones, amongst which when he made an excellent sermon,
concluding it with Gloria Pat. he was by them answered, Amen, Amen venerabilis
Beda. Others assign this reason: At his death an unlearned Monk making him an
Epitaph, blundred thus far on a verse, Hac sunt in fossa Bedae ossa: but
because the verse was yet imperfect, he went to bed, leaving a space between
the two last words, which he found in the morning supplied in a strange
Character, with Vener^bilis; and so he made his verse, and Beda got his name.

England is patible of a threefold division. 1 into 6 circuits, destinated to
the Itinerary Judges. Secondly, into 22 Episcopal Dioceses: Thirdly, into 40
Shires. The Realm was first divided into circuits by King Henry the second,
who appointed, that twice in the year, two of the most grave and learned
Judges of the Land, should in each circuit administer Justice in the chief or
head towns of every country. Of these Judges, one sits on matters
criminal, concerning the life and death of melefactours; the other in actions
personal, concerning title of land, debts, or the like, between party and
party. The first circuit (for we will begin at the West) comprehends the
Counties of Wiltes, Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Dorset, and Southampton: the
second contains the Counties of Oxford, Berkes, Gloucester, Monmouth,
Hereford, Worcester, Salop, and Stafford. The third has in it the Counties of
Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex, and Hartford. The fourth consists of the Shires
of Buckingham, Bedford, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Norfolk, and Suffolk. The
fifth of the Shires of Northampton, Rutland, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derbie,
Leicester, and Warwick. And the sixth and last, of the Shires of York, Durham,
Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancaster. So that in these six
circuits are numbered 38 Shires. The two remaining, are Middlesex, and Cheshire;
wh^reof the first is exempted, because of its vicinity to London: and the
second, as being a County Palatine, and having peculiar Judges, and
Counselors to it self.

Our Church-gouernment is as we have said, by Archbishops, and Bishops, which
are in number 22; and so many are the Episcopal Dioceses. Archbishops we have
two, one of York, under whom are Bishops of Chester, Durham, and Carlisle; the
other of Canterbury, who is Primate and Metropolitan of all England, under
whom are the 17 other Bishops of England, and the 4 of Wales. This Archbishop
of Canterbury used to take place in all Councels at the Popes right foot:
which took beginning at the Council of Lateran, when Urban the second called
Anselme the Archbishop from among the other Prelates then assembled, and placed
him at his right foot, saying; Includamus hunc in orb nostro, tanquam altorius
orbis Papam, Ao 1099. They also were accounted Legatinati; which honorable
title was first given to Archbishop Theobald by Pope Innocent the second, and
so perpetuated to his successors. Both these Archbishops, together with all
the Bishops of Wales and England, have their place and suffrage in the high
Court of Parliament, as Barons of the Realm; and that in a double respect:
first in relation had to their offices; next to their Baronries which they hold
of the King. Yet do they not enjoy all the prerogative of temporal Barons;
for they must not be tried by their Peers, but must be left to a Jury of 12
ordinary men: neither can they in examination, make a protestation on their
honor, but must be put to their oaths. As for the Ecclesiastical Courts,
besides such as appertain to the Archbishop himself, besides such as the
Chancellor of every Bishop holds in his Diocese; besides Courts holden in
private Parishes, which are called Peculiars, and besides the Visitations, which
are the assemblies of all the ministers in a Diocese, before their Bishop or
his ordinary, there is the Synod or Convocation, which is as it were a
Parliament of the Clergy. In this Synod there assemble for the reforming of
the Church, whether it be for point of faith or discipline; and for the
granting of tenths and fifteenths unto the King; all the right reverend Fathers
the Archbishops and Bishops; the Deanes of Cathedral Churches. and a certain
number of ministers chosen out of every Diocese; these last being as it were
the Knights and Burgesses of the house.

The Shires were first made by King Alfred, both for the easier and speedier
administration of justice: Lambe^ts B. of duties.
and because the natural inhabitants of the Land, after the example, and under
color of the Danes, committed sundry outrages and robberies Over every one of
these Shires and Counties, he appointed a Sheriff; and diverse Justices, to see
into the behavior of private men* and to punish such as were deliquent: and in
times of war either already begun, or intended, he instituted a Prefect or
Liestenant; to whom he gave authority to see to their musters, their provision
of arms; and if occasion served, to punish such as rebelled or mutinied. This
wise King ordained also, that his subjects should be divided into tens or
tithings, every of which severally should give bond for the good abearing of
each other; and he who was of that dissolute behavior, that he could not be
admitted to these tithings, was forthwith convayed to the house of correction.
By this course men were not careful only of their own actions, but had an eye
to all the nine, for whom he stood bound; as the nine had over him; insomuch
that a poor girl might travel safely with a bag of gold in her hand, and
none durst meddle with her. The ancientest of these ten men were called (...),
the Tythingmen. Ten of the ^ighest or neighboring tythings, made that lesser
division which we call hundreds; which name cannot be derived from the like
number of villages, for none of our hundreds are so large; and one of them in
Berkshire there is, which contains five hamlets only. We have then a division
of the Realm first into 40 Shires; of the Shires into diverse hundreds; and of
the hundreds into ten tythi^gs. As for the government; the chief officer is
still the Sheriff, whose office is to assist the Itinerary Judges in executing
Justice; to gather in the the Kings amerciaments, etc. Next to him are certain
of the Gentry, which we call Justices of the peace, dispersed in all parts of
the County, for the better ordering and punishing of peccant people. The Courts
herein kept, are either the County Court kept every three weeks, wherein the
Sheriff or his Deputy preside^h; or the Assizes holden twice a year by the
Itinerary Judges. In every hundred there is chosen one officer out of the
Yeomanrie, whom we call the Constable of the hundred; who receiving warrants
from the Sheriff or Justices, dispatcheth them to the Constables of every Town
and Village within his hundred: and here also is a Court kept every three
weeks, wherein the steward of the hundred or his depu^y presideth; and wherein
we hold pleas only for actions under the value of 4s unless in some particular
hundreds, where by especial charter, the value of the actions is not limited,
as that of Slaughter in Glocestershire. There are kept also in every Village
twice a year, Courts which inquire into actions between the King and the
subject, which we call Courts leete; and also other courts wherein are handled
actions between the lord and his tenants, which we call Courts Baron; and are
summoned at the pleasure of the lord. Thus we see that Comines had good cause
to write, that of all Signeuries in the world that ever he knew, the Realm of
England was the Country where the Commonwealth was best governed. I return
again to the Shires, of which some take their names from the ancient
inhabitants, as Essex and Sussex from the East and South Saxons: some from the
chief town, as Oxfordshire, and Gloucestersh^re: some from the situation, as
Northumberland and Devonshire, this later taking name from the British word
Devinon, signifying low valleys, whereof it much consists: and some from the
figure, as Corn^wall, from the resemblance it has to a horn; and Kent or
Cantium, because it is a corner of the Isle, the word importing as much; as we
may see by the word Canton still in use among Heralds. Of those shires the
biggest is Yorkshire, out of which it is thought that 70000 footmen might be
levied, and in them all are comprehended 145 Castles, or rather the ruins of
Castles, of which few are of any strength, and such as are, are in the Kings
custody: it being nothing profitable to the State, to permit any man to
fortify himself in a well-contriued Castle. Here are also 9725 Parishes,
besides Chapels, equal in bigness to many Parishes. Of these Parishes there are
585 Market Towns, being no Cities; the chief of which are Shrewesbury,
Northampton, Southampton, Leicester, etc.

The Cities are in number 22, the chief of which are 1 London, pleasantly
seated on the Thames, which divides it into two parts: ancient is this City,
and long flourished before the Roman conquest, by whom it was called Augusta.
Her circuit may contain 8 miles, in which space are 121 Parish Churches; the
Palace of the King, the houses of the Nobility; Colleges for the study of the
Laws, (I mean not the Civil Law, which is Ius gentium, but (as we call it)
the Common Laws, appropriate only to this kingdom, of greater antiquity and
indifferency then the Civil. It is wondrous populous, containing well nigh
400000 people, which number is much augmented in the Term time. I compare
London with Paris thus; London is the richer, the more populous, and more
ancient: Paris the greater, more uniform, and better fortified. 2 York on the
river Ure, is the second city of England according to the Verse, Londinum caput
est and regni urbs prima Britanni,
Eboracum a prim^ iure secunda venit.
In Britain London is the fairest Town,
The second place York claims as its own.
^^mous is this City for the death and burial of the Emperor Seu^rus, and for
the Law Court, instituted and placed here by K, Henry the eight, for the ease
of his Northern subjects, like the ordinary French Parliaments. 3 Bristoll, an
especial fine Town, and conveniently seated for ^raffiqu^. 4 Norwich in
Norfolk. Exeter in Devonshire, etc. none of which are comparable to the Cities
of Italy, or France; because the Gentlemen there live continually in the
Cities, ours in the Villages.

We have but two Universities, which may equal six, nay ten of the
Universities of other Countries, (so that Paris, with some few others, be not
in the number) most of them being no better then our Colleges of Eaton and
Winchester, or the Collegiate Churches of Gloucester, Worcester, etc. And scarce
any of them is endowed with so much revenues, as two or three of our Colleges.
The fairer and more ancient is Oxford, which of long time together with Paris,
Salamanca, and Bononia, has bin by Popes Edicts, honored with the title of
General^ studium. The other is Cambridge, which giving the upper hand to her
sister, shall take place of most of the daughters of the Europaan Muses. That
the University of Cambridge is not of so great a standing, as that of Oxford,
is evident by the testimony of Robertus de Remington, cited by M. Camden, viz:
Regnante Edwardo primo (it should rather be read secundo) de studio Grantbridge
facta est Academia sicut Oxonium: where the word sicut* does not import an
identity of the time; but a relation to Oxford, as to the pattern. We see this
truth yet clearer in the Bull of Pope John the 21th, the cotemporary of our
Edward the 2d, as I find it in the work of that great searcher of Academical
Antiquities, Mr Brian Twine: Apostolica autoritate statuimus, (says the Bull)
quod Collegium magistrorum and scholarium eiusdem studij (speaking of
Cambridge) Vniversitas sit c^nsenda, etc. But what need more then a determinate
sentence of the first Parliament, holden under our now gracious Sovereign? For
when the Clarke of that Court had put the name of Cambridge before Oxford; the
Parliament taking disdainfully that Hysteron proteron, commanded the
Antiquities of both Universities to be searched; and after search made, gave
verdict for Oxford. The most renowned University thus founded, grew not
suddenly (as it seems) into esteem. For when William of Wainslet, Bishop of
Winchester, (and founder of that excellent College in Oxford, dedicated to
Mary Magdalen, whereof I am an unworthy member) persuaded at Oxford to found
some College; imm^ potius Cantabrigiae (replied the King) ut duas, si fieri
posset, in Anglia Academias habeam. Of this enough, and perhaps more then mine
Aunt Cambridge will conne me thank for.

That the Brittain^s were descended from the Gauls, Caesar in his Commentaries
does affirm, and M. Camden proves with unanswerable arguments. Camden.
To omit therefore the fable of Brute, and the Catalogue of 68 Kings, before
the coming of the Romans hither: certain it is, Caesar found the people very
uncivil and illiterate, all the learning being lo^ked up in the breasts of the
Druides; who not writing any thing, but telling and teaching by word of mouth,
kept the people in a barbarous ignorance. From these Druides, the Gauls
received their discipline, and he that desired to be perfect in it, came to
Britain, and here learnt it. The Country continued a Roman Province till
after the year 400* when Proconsul Aetius taking with him away the Legionary
Soldiers, to defend Gallia from the Franks and Burgundians, left South
Britain a prey to the Scots and Picts. To repress the fury of these
invaders, the Romans having denied; the Britains sued to Aldroenus, king of
Armorica, (now Britain in France) for aid: whose brother Constaentine, having
beaten back the Scots and ^icts, was crowned King: a dignity which he inioyed
not long, being stabbed by a Pict. Him succeeded his son Constantius, murdered
by the means of Vortiger, Earl of Cornwall; who was afterward King: and
finding himself unable to defend himself against the Picts, sent for the
^axons, a potent people of Germany. Those Saxons flocked hither a main, under
the conduct of Hengist and Horsus; who finally drove the Britains into the

Britains; of all which, the most infamous was Vortiger, who betrayed his
country to the Saxons; the most famous was Arthur, of whom the Monkish Writers
of those times relate many idle and impossible actions: doubtless he was a man
of tried valor, as having vanquished the Saxons in 12 several battles; and
pity it is* his atchieuments came not unto us entire in themselves, and unmixed
with the fabulous deeds of arms, attributed to him and his Knights of the
round table. For by this ouer-straining his worths, the pidling writers of
former times have only given posterity just occasion to suspect that virtue,
which they so much thought to adorn: and filled us with as much ignorance of
the Story, as admiration of the persons. But this has not bin King Arthurs
case alone; for in the same measure and kind, have the French Monks used
Charlemaigne, and the 12 Peers of France. This Arthur is said to have begun
the custom of solemnizing the Nativity of our Savior, for the 12 days next
after his birthday; with such feasts and sports, as are yet used by the lords
of misrule in some Gentlemen's houses: an ordination which the Scottish Writers
of these times much blame, it being a time fitter for our devotion, then our
mirth.
In this decay of the British rule, the victorious Saxons erected their
Heptarchie, or seven several kingdoms.

1 The Kingdom of KENT, contained Kent only; the people of which by the
testimony of Julius Caesar, were the most civil and ingenious. This kingdom
began under Hengi^t the Saxon Captain, Anno 4^5; and after the succession of 18
Kings, ended in the time of Baldred. who resigned his regality to Egbert K. of
the West Saxous, 827. The first Christian King was Ethelbert, who received
Austin, sent from Gregory Bishop of Rome, Ao 595.

2 The Kingdom of the SOVTH-SAXONS contained the Regni, now Sussex and Surrey.
It began under a Saxon named H^lla, Ao 536; and ended after a succession of 7
Kings, in the time of Aldine, who lost it to the West Saxons, Ao 648. The first
Christian King was Ethelwold.

3 The Kingdom of the EAST ANGLES contained the Iceni, now Norfolk, Suffolk,
and Cambridgeshire. It began Ao 546, under the Saxon Vffa, and ended after the
succession of 17 Kings, Ao 964: in which year Edward the elder took it from
the D^nes; who before had taken it from S. Edmund the last King of the Saxons
blood, Ao 869. The first Christian King was Carpenwald, Ao 630.

4 The Kingdom of the NORTHVMBERS contained Yorkshire, Lancashire,
Richmondshire, Durrham, Cumberland, Westmorland, Northumberland, and so to
Edinburgh, being the ancient seat of the Brigantes and Ottadini. It
comprehended the Kingdom of Deira, reaching from Humber to Tine, began by Ella
a Saxon, Ao 547: and of Brenitia extending from Tine to Edinburgh, begun by Ida
a Saxon, Ao 550. They were both united under the name of Northumberland by
Ethelsride. It continued under the succession of 23 Saxon Kings, till the year
878, in which time it was subdued by the Danes; who afterward yielded this
Kingdom to Eldred King of the West Saxons, Anno 954. The first Christian King
hereof was Edwin, Ao 627.

5 The kingdom of the EAST SAXONS contained the Trinobants, now Essex and
Middlesex. It began Ao 614, and ended after the succession of 17 Kings* the
last of which was Suthred: in whose time Egbert king of the West Saxons united
it to his kingdom, Ao 832. The first Christian King was Sebert, A^ 624.

6 The kingdom of MERCIA being the greatest, contained part of the Ic^ni or
Huntingdonshire. The Cateiuclani or Buckingham, Bedford, and Hertfordshiere^:
the Coritani or Rutland, Northampton, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, and
Darbishires: and the Cornavij, or Worcester Warwick, Stafford, Chester, and
Shropshires. It began under Penda a Saxon Anno 626; and ended after a
succession of 18 Kings, in the time of Cenolphe: when Alured joined it to the
West Saxons, An. 876. The first Christian King was Peada, Anno 647. After it
was seized on by the Danes, and from them again recovered by Edward the Elder.
Anno 917.

7 The most strong and prevailing kingdom was of the WEST SAXONS, containing
the Damnonij, or Cornwall and Devonshire: the Belgae containing Somersetshire,
Wiltshire, and Hampshire, the Durotriges, or Dorcetshire; and the Attrebatij or
Berkeshire.

principal kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchie, styled himself the first Monarch:
comm^nding South-Brittaine to be called England, from the English Saxons, from
whose blood he was extracted, and over whom he reigned. Somewhat before this
Egbert, the Danes (...) like a violent thunderclap on the Northumbers; and
(...) they were often vanquished, yet being as often victorious they at last
^eased on the Monarchy of England.

Etheldred, who being of an evil carriage, gave hope to the Danes once more to
recover their sovereignty: who so prevailed, that Etheldred was content to pay
the yearly tribute of 10000 pounds: which at last they enhanced to 48000
pounds. This tyranny Etheldred not able to endure, warily writ unto his
subjects, to kill all the Danes as they slept on S. Bricies night, being the 12
day of November Anno 1012: which being accordingly put in execution, Swain
King of Danemarke came with a Navy of 350 sail into England. To avoid this
storm Etheldred fled into Normandy, leaving his poor subjects to the mercy
of the Danish King: who tyrannized over them till his death: after whom
succeeded his son Canutus, who (maugre Etheldred now returned, or his soon
Edmund Ironside, a most valiant young Prince, and treacherously murdered)
possessed himself of the Monarchy.
The Danish Kings.
1017 1 Canutus 20 1037 2 Harald 4 1041 3 Hardy Canute. After whose death, the
Danes having reigned in England 26 years, and tyrannized 255 years; were
utterly expeld by the English: who crowned Edward, surnamed the Confessor, the
youngest son of Etheldred, for their King.
Now concerning the Danes abiding here, and going hence, as they did, I observe
three customs yet in use amongst us. First, each English house maintained one
Dane, who living idly like the drone amongst the bees, had the benefit of all
their labors, and was by them called Lord Dane: and even now when we see an
idle fellow, we call him a Lurdane. 2ly The Danes used, when the English drank,
to stabbe them or cut their throats; to avoid which villainy, the party then
drinking, requested some of the next sitters to be his surety or pledge, whilst
he paid nature her due: and hence have we our usual custom of pledging one
another. 3ly The old Romans at the expulsion of their kings annually solemnized
the Fugalia: according to which pattern, the joyful English having cleared
the country of the Danes, instituted the annual sports of Hock-tide; the word
in their old tongue the Saxon, importing the time of scorning or triumphing.
This solemnity co^sisted in the merry meetings of the neighbors on those
days, during which the festival lasted; and was celebrated by the younger
sort of both sexes, with all manner of exercises and pastimes in the streets;
even as Shrouetide yet (...). But now time has so corrupted it, that the name
excepted, there remains no sign of the first institution.

The Saxons reinthroned.
1045 15 Edward the Confessor. This King collected out of the Danish, Saxon,
and Mercian laws, one universal and general law; whence our Common law is
thought to have had its original: which may be true of the written laws, not
of the customary and unwritten laws; these being certainly more ancient. He
was in his life of that holiness, that he received power from above to cure
many diseases; amongst others the swelling of the throat, called by us the
Kings evil: a prerogative that continues hereditary to his successors of
England. Finally after his death he was canonized for a Saint: and died having
reigned 24 years. 1066 16 Harald Son to Earl Godwin, was chosen King in the
nonage of Edgar Ad^ling, Grandchild to Edmond Iron^ide, the true heir of the
kingdom. In his reign William Duke of Normandy pretending a donation of
Edward the Confessor; invaded England, slew Harald, and with him, 66654 of his
English Soldiers; possessed himself of the kingdom: using such policy in
his new conquest, that he utterly disheartened the English from hopes of better
fortune.
The Norman Kings.
1067 1 William the Conqueror 22. 1089 2 William Rufus second son to the
Conqueror, taking advantage of the absence of his brother Robert, then in the
Holy land; was crowned King, and was after slain in Newforrest in Hampsh: by
an arrow leueld at a Deer. 13 1102 3 Henry for his learning named Bean Clarke,
excluded his brother Robert from the kingdom; took from him the Duchy of
Normandy; and put out his eyes; he died leaving only one daughter, viz: Maud.
35. 1136 4 Stephen son to Alice daughter to the Conqueror, succeeded; who to
purchase the peoples love released the tribute called Danegelt; he spent most
of his reign in war against Maude the Empress, 19.
The Saxon l^ne restored.
1155 5 Henry II son to Maud the Empress, daughter to Henry the first, and
to Maud daughter to Malcolme King of Scotland and Margaret sister to Edgar
Ath^linge, restored the Saxon blood to the Crown of England. His father was
Geofrie Earl of Anion, Touraine, and Maine; which Provinces he added to the
English Empire; as also the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Earledomes of Guyen, and
Poictou, by Elen^ur his wife; and a great part of Ireland. Happy was he in all
things, the unnatural rebellions of his sons excepted, 34. 1189 6 Richard
for his valor surnamed C^ur de Lion, warred in the Holy land; overcame the
Turks, whom he had almost driven out of Syria; took the I Will of Cyprus; and
after many worthy atchieuements, returning homewards to defend Normandy, and
Aquitaine against the French: was by tempest cast upon Austria, where he was
taken prisoner, put to a greiuous ransom, and finally slain at the siege of
Chaluz, in Limousin, 12. 1201 7 John his Brother succeeded, an unhappy Prince;
neither could he expect better, being an unnatural son to his father, and an
undutiful subject to his brother: he was l^ke to have lost his kingdom to
the French, who on the Popes curse came to subdue it: Finally after a base
submission of himself and kingdom to the Popes Legate, he was poisoned at
Swinstead Abbey. 17. 1218 8 Henry III his son, expelled the intruding French
out of England; but being vexed in the Barons wars could not do the like in
France: where, in his fathers life, they had seized on all the English
Provinces. He confirmed the statutes of Magna Charta. 56. 1274 9 Edward awed
France, subdued Wales, brought Scotland into subjection; of whose king and
nobility he received homage, 34. 1308 10 Edward II, a dissolute Prince, hated
of his Nobles, and contemned by the vulgar, for his immeasurable love to Pierce
Gaueston, and the Spencers: was twice shamefully beaten by the Scots, and being
deposed, was murdered in Berkly Castle. 19. 1327 11 Edward III, a most virtuous
and valorous Prince, brought the Scots to a formal obedience, overthrew the
French Armies, took the Town of Callice, and many fair possessions in that
kingdom, 50. 1277 12 Richard II, an ungoverned and dissolute King, lost what
his father the Black Prince, and his Grandfather had gained; and for many
enormities was deposed, and murdered at Pomfret Castle, 22.
The Lancastrian Lince.
1399 13 Henry IV, son to John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster third son to Edw.
the third; was by the consent of the people chosen King: and spent his whole
reign in suppressing homebred rebellions, 15. 1414 14 Henry V, the mirror of
magnificence and pattern of true virtue, pursued the title to France, and
won it; being ordained heir apparent to the French Crown, in a Parliament
of their Nobility, Clergy, and Commons: but lived not to possess it, 9. 1423
15 Henry VI, was crowned King of France in Paris, which kingdom he held
during the life of his Uncles, John of Bedford, and Humfrey of Gloucester: after
whose deaths, he not only lost France to the French, but England and his life
to the Yorkish faction, 38.
The Yorkish Line.
1461 16 Edward IV, Earl of March, son to Richard D. of York, son to
Richard Earl of Cambridge, son to Edmund of Langley, fourth son to King
Edward the 3d whose second son Lionel Duke of Clarence, married his daughter
and heir Philip, to Roger Mortimer Earl of March; whose son Roger had issue
Anne, married to Richard Duke of York; and was the mother to Edward the
fourth. He after nine bloody battles, especially that of ^owton, in which
were slain 36000 English; was quietly seated in his dominions of England and
Ireland 23 1484 17 Edward V his son, was before his Coronation murdered by
his Uncle Richard, in the Tower of London. 1484 18 Richard III, a most wicked
and tyrannical man, to make way unto the Diadem, murdered K. Henry the 6, and
Prince Edward his son: 3 George Duke of Clarence his brother: 4 Hastings, a
faithful servant to King Ed^a^d: 5, Rivers, Va^ghan, and Gray, the Queens
kindred: 6 Edward the fifth his soueraign, with his young cosen Richard: 7 Henry
Duke of Buckingham his dear friend, and greatest coadiutor in these his
ungodly practices: and 8 his wife Anna, so to make way to an incestuous
marriage with his Cosen Elizabeth: but before the solemnity, he was slain at
Bosworth, 3.
The Union of the Families.
1482 10 Henry Earl of Richmond heir to the house of Lancaster, as son to
Margaret, daughter to John D. of Somerset, son to John Earl of Somerset,
son to John of Gaunt D. of Lancaster; after the overthrow of Richard, married
Elizabeth daughter and heir to Edward the 4th. He was also extracted from the
British royal blood, as being son to Edmund Tudor Earl of Richmond, son to
Owen Tudor (descended from Cadwallader the last British King) and Katherine of
France, widow of Henry the 5th. His whole wars were against homebred
Rebels, the chief being Lambert, and the followers, and fautors of Perkin
Warbecke, 23. 1509 20 Henry VIII, heir to both families* between which were
sought for the Diadem, 17 pitched fields, in which perished 8 Kings and
Princes, 40 Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls; 200000 of the common people; besides
Barons and Gentlemen. This King banished the usurped supremacy of the Popes,
and began the first reformation of religion; though formerly he had written a
book against Luther, for which the Pope entitled him Defender of the faith,
39. 1548 21 Edward VI, a most virtuous and religious Prince perfected the
reformation began by his father; and was a most hopeful young King, as England
ever nourished 6. 1554 22 Mary his sister, a woman not of a cruel nature, if
not misled: yet so much addicted to the Pope, that in that cause there died a
Q. elect, virtuous Jane G^ey. 3 Lords, 3 Dukes, many Knights and hundreds of
the reformed subjects; she lost Calli^e, and died having ruled five years.
1559 23 Elizabeth, a most gracious and heroicke Lady, was by divine providence
preserved, during the troublesome reign of her sister, to sway this scepter.
She reduced religion to its primitive purity, refined the corrupt coins,
stored her royal Navy with all warlike munition* succored the Scots against
the French, the French Protestants against the Catholics, and both against
the Spaniard she defended Belgia against the Arms of Spain, she comm^nded
the whole Ocean, entered league with the Muscovite, and was famous for her
virginity and government amongst the Turks, Persians, and Tartars, 49.
The Union of the Kingdoms.
1603 24 JAMES, a most learned and religious King, son to Mary Queen of
Scotland, daughter to James the fifth son to James the fourth, and Margaret
eldest daughter to Henry the seventh of England: which Margaret was secondly
married to Archembald Douglasse; whose daughter Margaret, was married to Matthew
Earl of Lennox; whose son Henry Lord Darnley, was father to our most
gracious Sovereign; descended from the eldest daughter of Henry the seventh,
both by father and mother. He was with all joyful acclamations saluted King
of England, March the 24, Anno 1603.
The revenewes of this kingdom were in King Henry the sevenths days, reckoned
by Boterus to be but 400000 crowns: which afterward he says to be improu'd to
a millio^ and 300000 crowns; yet falls he far short of the true
proportion: which since I do not directly know, I will not aim at, lest I
should shoot as wide from the mark.

Concerning the place due to the Kings of England in general counsels, and
the rank they held among other Christian Princes, I find that the Emperor of
Germany was accounted Mayor filius Ecclesiae; the King of France, Minor filius;
and the King of England, Filius tertius, and adoptivus. The K. of France in
general councels had place next the Emperor on his right hand; the King of
England, on his left hand; and the King of Scotland next before Castile. Now
indeed, the King of Spain being so much improued, is the dearly beloved son
of the Church, and arrogateth to himself the place above all other Princes:
but in the time of Pope Julius the 2d, controversy arising between the
Ambassadors of these two Princes for precedence: the Pope adjudged it to
belong of right unto England. And Pope Pius the fourth, upon the like
controversy, arising between the Ambassadors of France and Spain; adjudged
the precedence to the French.

The Arms of England are Mars, 3 Lions passant Gardant, Sol. The reasons why
these Arms quartred with the French, take the second place; are 1 because that
France is the larger and more famous kingdom: 2 That the French seeing the
honor done to their Arms, might more easily be induced to have acknowledged
the English title. 3 Because the English Arms is compounded of the Lion of
Aquitaine, and the two Lions of Normandy; being both French Dutchies.

The principal orders of knighthood are, 1 of the Round Tab^e, instituted by
Arthur King of the Britains, and one of the Worlds nine Worthies. It
consisted of 150 knights, whose names are recorded in the history of K. Arthur,
there where Sir Vr a wounded knight, came to be cured of his hurts, it being
his fate, that only the best Knight of the whole order could be his Surgeon.
The principal of the^ were Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristrum, Sir Lambrocke; Sir
Gawaine, etc. They were all placed at one Round Table, to avoid quarrels about
priority and place. The Round Table hanging in the great hall at Winchester, is
falsely called Arthurs Round Table; it being not of sufficient antiquity, and
containing but 24 seats. Of these knights there are reported many fabulous
stories. They ended with their founder, and are fained by that Lucian of
France, Rablaies, to be the Ferry-man of hell: and that their pay is a piece of
mouldie cheese, and a phillip on the nose.

2 Of the Garter, Camden.
instituted by King Edward the third, to increase virtue and true valor in the
hearts of his Nobility; or as some will, in honor of the Countess of
Salisburies Garter, of which Lady, the King had formerly bin inamoured. There
are of this order 26 knights, of which the kings of England are Sovereigns:
and is so much desired for its excellency, that 8 Emperors, 22 foreign kings,
20 foreign Dukes, and diverse Noblemen of other Countries have bin followers of
it. The ensign is a blew Garter, buckled on the left leg, on which these words
are embroydered, viz: Honi soit qui mal y pense. About their neck they wear a
blew ribbond, at the end of which hangs the image of S. George, whose day is
the installation day.

3 Of the Bath, brought first into England 1399, by Henry the fourth: they are
created at the Coronation of Kings and Queens, and the installations of the
Princes of Wales; their duty is to defend true Religion, Widows, Maids,
Orphans, and to maintain the kings rights.

WALES.
WALES is bounded on all sides with the Sea, except the East, where it is
separated from England by the river Dee, and a line drawn to the river Wie.
But the most certain and particular limit is a huge ditch, which beginning at
the influxe of Wie into the Seuerne; reaches unto Chester, where Dee is
mingled with the sea, even 84 miles in length. It was built by Offa king of the
Mercyans, and is in Welsh called Claud Offa, that is, Offa's Dike. Concerning
this ditch King Harald made a law, that what Welchman soever was found with a
weapon on this side of it, he should have his right hand cut off by the kings
officers.

The ancients were the Silures possessing Radnor, Brecknocke, Monmouth, and
Glamorgan shires: the Dimetae inhabiting Carmardan, Penbrooke, and Cardigan
shires: the Ordouices dwelling in Montgomerie, Merioneth, Denbigh, Flint, and
Carnarvon shires.

As for the name of Wales, some deduce it from Idwallo, son to Cadwallader,
who with the small remainder of the Britons, retired unto this Country. But
this Etymology is by the greater number not approved, though we find many
etymons far more wrested then this is. Others very iudiciously conjecture,
that as the Britons derive their pedigree from the Gauls, so they also retain
the name. For the Frenchmen to this day call this people Galloys; and the
Country Galls: which by using W for G, according to the custom of the Saxons,
is Walloys and Walls: And further, the Germans as yet call some nations of
France by the name of Wallons. I for my part dare be of this opinion* though I
know the general conceit is, that after the Saxons had gotten plenarie seisin
and delivery of England, the Britains who fled hither, were by them called
Walli or Welshmen, because they were of diverse manners and language; this name
importing as much as Aliens.

The Country is very mountainous and barren. Their chief commodities are
woollen clothes, as cottons, bays, etc. These merchandises are from all parts
of Wales brought up unto Oswestre (which is the farthest town in all
Shropshire) as unto a common emporie. For hither on Mundayes (which are the
market days) come from Shrewsbury the cloath-merchants, and drapers there
dwelling; buy these commodities, carry them home, and from thence disperse them
into all parts and places of the kingdom.

They have here also a tripartite division, 1 into three circuits; for the
administration of Justice. The first contains Flint, Denbigh, and Montgomerie
shires; the second Radnor, Glamorgan, and Brecknocke shires: the third
Cardigan, Carmarthen, and Pembrooke shires: and the fourth the Counties of
Merioneth; Carnarvon, and the Isle of Anglesey, Wales is secondly divided into
four Dioceses for Ecclesiastical discipline: and thirdly into twelve Shires;
in which are comprehended Snowdon hills, the Brethen, and Plinlimmon: 1 chase,
13 forests, 36 parkes, 99 bridges; 2^0 Rivers: the chief of which are Dee,
arising nigh Carduvaure hills, in Merionethshire, and falling into the sea not
far from Chester. Over this river Edgar K. of England was rowed by 7
inferior kings. 2 Wie in Latin called Vaga, arising in Plinlimmon hills, and
emptying it self into the Seuerne at Chepstowe. The rivers which are more in
the heart of the Country, (for these two are but borderers) are 1 Conwy, which
arising in Merionethshire, and dividing Denbigh from Carnarvonshire, mingleth
with the sea at Aberconney. 2 Tiuie, which arising in Montgomeryshire, and
passing between Carmarden, Penbrooke, and Cardigan shires; runs into the
sea a little below Cardigan: and 3 Chedhydy, which running quite through
Pembrookeshire, emptieth it self into Milford haven; one of the most safest
and capacious havens, not in England alone, but in the whole world.

The men are of a faithful carriage, one especially toward another, in a
strange Country; and to strangers in their own. They are questionless of a
temper much inclining to choler, as being subject to the passion called by
Aristotle (...); by which men are quickly moved, and soon appeased, of all
angers the best and noblest. The Welsh language has the least commixture with
foreign words, of any used in Europe; and by reason of its many consonants, is
less pleasing.

Here are 1016 Parishes, of which are 56 market towns, (being no cities, and in
them 41 castles) and 4 cities, viz: S. David's or Meneuia in Pembrookeshire: 2
Bangor in Carnarvonshire; 3 Asaph in Flintshire. 4 Lannaff in Glamorganshire,
being all the seats of so many Bishops, who comprehend under their several
Dioceses all Wales, and acknowledge the Archbishop of Canterbury to be their
Metropolitan. As for S. David's, it was in former times an Archbishops See; but
a grievous pestilence here raging, the Sea was translated into little Britain
in France. The ordinary market-townes; for so many as I have seen, are
generally fairer then ours in England, and were for the most part built not
only for mutual commerce of the neighboring villages; but also for strength
and ability of resistance; as being well seated and fortified with walls and
castles: Though now partly by the iniquity of time, which is ^dax rerum; partly
by the negligence of the people, whose care and cost should have maintained
them; but chiefly by the policy of our Kings, who would not suffer strong
forts to stand in a country almost inaccessible, and among men so impatient of
the yoke: the very ruins of them are almost brought to ruin.

In this country and (as I am informed) in Cardiganshire, have lately some
siluer-mines bin found out, by that industrious and worthy Common-wealths-man,
Mr. Thomas Middleton: to the glory of this particular Country, and the profit
of the whole Monarchy of Great Britain.

After the death of Cadwallader, Milles.
the Princes were no more styled Kings of the Britains, but Princes of Wales:
who follow in this order.

The Princes of all Wales.
690 1 Idwaello. 2 Rodericke. 3 Conan. 4 Mervyn. 843 5 Rodericke, who divided
Wales between his three sons. To Mervyn the eldest, he gave Northwales; to
Amarand the second, Powisland; to Cadel the youngest, South Wales.
NORTH WALES contains the shires of Merioneth, Denbigh, Flint, and Carnarvan.

The Princes of North Wales.
877 1 Mervyn. 2 Idwallo. 3 Merricke. 4 Ioanes. 1067 5 Conan. 32 1099 6
Griffin. 21 1120 7 Owen. 58 1178 8 David. 16 1194 9 Leoline. 46 1240 10 David
116 1246 11 Leoline II. Who consulting once with a witch, was told that it was
his destiny to ride through London with a Crown on his head: hereupon he
growing burdensome to the English Borderers, was in a battle overthrown; his
head fixed upon a stake, and adorned with a paper crown, was by a horseman
carried triumphantly through London, 1282; and so the prophecy was fulfilled.
In him ended the line of the Princes of North Wales, who had for the space of
405 years, resisted not only the private undertakers of England, who were
commonly of the Nobility; but the whole forces also of many most puissant
Monarchs: Whose attempts they always made frustrate, by retiring into the
heart of their country, and leaving the English more woods and hills to
encounter, then men. But now the fatal period of the British liberty being
come, they were constrained to yield to the stronger.
What Provinces North Wales contains, is before said; to these we must add
the I Will of Anglesey, (which hereafter we shall describe) in one of whose
towns, called Aberfrawe, the Princes hereof use to reside; and thereupon were
called kings of Aberfrawe. Shrewsbury also as long as they continued masters of
it, was the seat royal of these Princes, who had here a very fair palace:
which being burned in some of their broils with England, is now converred into
private gardens, for the use of the citizens. The farthest bridge of ^his town
called the Welch-bridge, was built by one of the Leolines, (the first as I
conjecture) whose statua is yet standing on the bridge-gue there.

Milles.
That this was of the three the most predominant principality, and to which the
other two were in a manner tributary, may be proved by the constitutions of
Howell Dha, that is, Howell the good, Prince of South Wales. One of which is,
that as the kings of Aberfrawe, were bound to pay in way of tribute, 63 pounds
unto the Kings of London; so the Kings of Dy^e^ar, and Matrafall, (or
South Wales and Powisland) should pay in way of tribute, the like sum unto
the Kings of Aberfrawe.

The Arms of the Princes of North Wales, were quarterly Gules and Or; four
Lions passant gardant, counter-hanged.

2 POWISLAND contained the whole County of Montgomery, the greater part of
Radnorshire, Camden.
and part of Shropshire. By the estimate of those times, it was held to be 15
Cantre^s, or hundreds of villages, (the word Cant, signifying an hundred* and
Tref, a village.) This Country was by th'aboue-mentioned Rodericke given unto
his second soon Amarandus; whom he chose to rule over the borders, because he
was a man of approved valor. The residence of these Princes was at Mathrafall,
who for that cause were called kings of Matrafall. It was then a great and a
fair town; now nothing in a manner, but a bare name: and stands in an equal
distance between Welch-poole, and Lanvilling, in Montgomeryshire.

It continued a principality, till the time of Edward the first. To whom at a
Parliament holden at Shrewsbury, Owen ap Griffin Prince thereof, resigned his
lands and title: and received them again of the King to hold in Capite, and
free baronage, according to the custom of England. Avis or Havis daughter and
heir to this Owen, was married unto John Charleton a Valect, (or Gentleman of
the privy Chamber) to Edward the 2d: by whom in right of his wife, he was made
Lord of Powis. It continued for four descents in this line; and then the
marriage of Jane, daughter and heir of Edward the last Lord, unto Sir John
Gray, conveyed unto him this title: which together with his issue, is now
extinct.

The Arms of these Princes of Powis, were Or, a Lion rampant Gules.

3 SOVTH-WALES contained the shires of Brecknocke, Carmarden, Glamorgan,
Penbrooke, and Cardigan.

9 Rhese II 10 Griffin II, in whom ended the line of the Princes of
South Wales, after they had with great struggling maintained their liberty, the
space of 300 years or there-about. The English nobility had at several times
plucked many towns, Lordships, and almost whole shires, from this principate:
which were all again recovered by this last Griffin; who not long enjoying his
victories, left the fruits of them to his two sons, Cynericke, and Meredith,
both whom our Henry 2d took, and put out their eyes. Yet did the Welchmen, as
well as in such a time of calamity they could wrestle, and tugge for their
liberty; till the felicity of Edward the first, put an end to all the wars
and troubles in these part.
It may perhaps be maruailed at, why Rodoricke the great, in the division
aboue-mentioned, gave unto his youngest son, the greatest and most fruitful
part of this whole Country. To which we answer, that South Wales indeed was
the greater and richer; but yet accounted the worser part; because the Nobles
there refused to obey their Prince; and also for that the Seacoasts were
grievously infested with Flemmings, English, and Normans. In which respect also
the Prince was enforced to remove his seat from Carmarden, then called
Maridune; up higher unto Dynefar or Devenor castle, where it continued even
till the Princes themselves had left to be: who for this cause were called
Kings of Dynefar.

When King Edward had thus fortunately effected this great business, he gave
unto his English Barons, and other gentlemen of good revenue and potencie,
diverse signieuries and estates here; as well to honor their valor showed in
the conquest, as to engage so many able men, both in purse and power, for the
perpetual defense and subjugation of it. As for the lordship of Flint, and the
towns and estates lying on the seacoasts, he held them in his own hands, both
to keep himself strong, and to curb the Welsh, and (wherein he dealt like the
politic Emperor Augustus) pretending the ease of such as he had there
placed; but indeed to have all the arms, and men of employment under himself
only.

This done, he divided Wales into six shires, viz: 1 Glamorgan, 2 Carmarden, 3
Pembrooke, 4 Cardigan, 5 Merioneth, and 6 Carnarvon, after the manner of
England. Over each of these as he placed a particular English Lieftenant; so
was he very desirous to have one general English Vicegerent, over the whole
body of the Welsh. But this when they mainly w^thstood, he sent for his wife,
then great with child, to Carnarvon; where, when she was d^liuered, Milles.
the king assembled the British Lords, and offered to name them a Governor
borne in Wales, which could speak not one word of English, and whose life no
man could tax. Such a one when they had all sworn to obey, he named his young
son Edward, since which time, our Kings eldest sons are Princes of Wales.
Their investiture is performed by the imposition of a cap of estate, and a
coronet, on his head that is invested, as a token of his principality: by
delivering into his hand a verge, being the emblem of government: by putting a
ring of gold on his finger, to show him how now he is a husband to the Country,
and a father to her children; and by giving him a patent, to hold the said
principality to him and his heirs Kings of England. By which words, the
separation of it from the Crown is prohibited; and the Kings keep in
themselves so excellent an occasion of obliging unto them their eldest son^,
when they pleased. In imitation of this custom, more ex Anglia translat^
(says Mariana.) John the first of Castile and Leon, made his son Henry Prince
of the Asturia's; which is a Country so craggie and mountainous, that it may
not improperly be called the Wales of Spain. And all the Spanish Princes even
to these times are honored with this title of Prince of the Asturia's.

Notwithstanding this provident care of Edward the first, in establishing his
Empire here, and the extreme rigor of Law here used by Henry the fourth, in
reducing them to obedience after the rebellion of Owen Glendower: yet till the
time of Henry the eighth, and his father, (both being extract from the Welsh
blood) they never contained themselves, or uery seldom, within the bounds of
true allegiance. For whereas before they were reputed even as Aliens; this
Henry made them (by act of Parliament) one Nation with the English; subject to
the same Laws; capable of the same preferments; and privileged with the same
immunities. He added six shires to the former number, out of those Countries
which were before reputed as the borders or marches of Wales; and enabled them
all to send knights and burgesses unto the Parliaments; So that the name and
language only excepted, there is now no difference between the English and
Welsh; happy union.

The same King Henry established for the ease of his Welsh subjects, a Court at
Ludlow, like unto the ordinary Parliaments in France; wherein the Laws are
ministered according to the fashion of the Kings Courts of Westminster. This
Court consists of one President, who is for the most part of the Nobility,
and is generally called the Lord President of Wales; of as many Counselors as
it shall please the King to appoint; one Attorney; one Sollicitour; one
Secretary; and the four Justices of the counties of Wales. The same Ludlow,
(for this must not be omitted) is adorned with a very fair castle; which is the
Palace of such Princes of Wales, of the English blood, as have come into this
Country, to solace themselves among their people. Here was young Edward he fifth,
at the death of his father: and here died Prince Arthur, eldest son to Henry
7th, both being sent hither by their fathers to the same end, viz: by their
presence to keep in order the unquiet Welchmen. And certainly as the presence
of the Prince was then a terror to the rebellious, so would it now be as great
a comfort to this peaceable people.

What the revenues of this principality are, I cannot say; yet we may boldly
affirm that they are not very small, by these two circumstances, in the
marriage of the Lady Catharine of Spain, to our abouenamed Prince Arthur. For
first her father Fernando, being one of the wariest Princes that ever were in
Europe, giving with her in Dowry 200000 Ducats; required for her iointer, the
third part only of this principality, and of the Earldome of Chester. And 2ly
after the death of Prince Arthur, the Nobles of the Realm persuaded Prince
Henry, to take her to wife; that so great a treasure, as the yearly revenewe
of her ioynture, might not be carried out of the kingdom.

The Arms of the Princes of Wales differ from those of England, only by the
addition of a labell of three points. But the proper and peculiar device, and
which we commonly, though corruptly, call the Princes Arms; is a Coronet
beautified with three Ostrich feathers, and inscribed round with Ich^dien, that
is Iseru^: alluding to that of the Apostle, the he^re while he is a child,
differs not from a servant. This Coronet was won by that valiant Prince,
Edward the black Prince, at the battle of Cressie, from John King of
Bohemia, who there wore it; and who^ he there slew. Since which time it has
been the cognizance of all our Princes.

I will now shut up my discourse of Wales with that testimony of the people,
which Henry the 2d used in a letter to Emanuel Emperor of Constantinople, The
Welsh nation is so aduenterous, that they dare encounter naked with armed men;
ready to spend their blood for their Country, and pawn their life for praise:
and adding only this, that since their incorporating with the English, they
have showed themselves most loyal, hearty, and affectionate subjects of the
State.

There are in Wales,

THE BORDERS.
BEfore we come into Scotland, we must of necessity pass through that batable
ground, lying between both kingdoms, called THE BORDERS: the inhabitants
wherereof are a kind of military men, subtle, nimble, and by reason of their
often skirmishes well experienced, and aduenturous. Once the English border
extended as far as unto Edenborough, East; and to Sterling, West: nigh unto
which last town, there was over the Friths of Dunbritton, a bridge built; and
in a cross thereon standing, there was written this pasport, I am free march
as passengers may kenne;
To Scots, to Brittans, and to Englishmen.
But when England groaned under the burden of the Danish oppression, the Scots
well husbanded that advantage; and not only enlarged their border to the
Tweede; but also took into their hands, Cumberland, Northumberland, and
Westmorland. The Norman Kings again recovered these Provinces, making the
Borders of both kingdoms to be Tweede, East; the Solway, West; and the
Cheviot hills in the midst. Of any great wars made on these borders, or any
particular officers appointed for the defense of them, I find no mention till
the time of Edward the first; who taking advantage on the Scots disagreements,
about the successor of Alexander the third; hoped to bring the Country under
the obedience of England. This quarrel between the two nations he began, but
could not end; the wars surviuing the author. So that what Velleius says of
the Romans and Carthaginians, I may as well say of the Scots and English: for
almost three hundred years together, aut bellum inter eos populos, aut belli
praeparatio, aut infi^a pax fuit. In most of these conflicts the Scots had the
worst, so that Daniel in his history seems to marvel how this corner of the
I Will could breed so many, had it bred nothing but men, as were slain in these
wars: yet in the reign of Edward the 2d, the Scots (having thrice defeated
that unhappy Prince) became so terrible unto the English Borderers, that an
hundred of them would fly from three Scots. It is a custom among the Turks
not to believe a Christian or a Jew complaining against a Turk^, except the^
occusation be confirmed by the testimony of some Turk also: which seldom
happening is not the least cause why so little justice is there done the
Christians. In like manner it is the law of these Borderers never to believe
any Scot complainining against an Englishman, unless some other Englishman
will witness for him; and so on the other side: Ex iure quodam inter
limitaneos rat^ (says Camden in his Elizab.) nullus ni^i Scotus in Scotu^,
nullus nifi Anglus in Anglum, testis admittitur. This custom making void in
this fashion al kinds of accusations, was one of the greatest causes of the
insolences on both sides committed. Besides t^ere were diverse here living,
which acknowledged neither King: but sometimes were Scots, sometimes English,
as their present crimes and necessities required protection or pardon. To keep
in this people, and secure the Borders, there were in each Kingdom three
officers appointed called the Lords wardens of the Marches: one being placed
over the East, the other over the West, the third over the middle borders. In
England the Warden of the East Marches had his seat at Berwicke (a town of
great strength, and which for the convenience of its situation, was the first
thing which the English took care to defend, and the Scots to surprise) of
which he was also governor. The Warden of the West Marches, had his seat in
Carlisle, which Henry the 8th for that cause well fortified. The Warden of the
middle Marches had no set place of residence, but was sometimes in one place,
sometimes in another, according as occasions required. But Imperij medium est,
terminus ante fuit, by the blessed marriage of the kingdoms, that being now
the middle of one, which was then the bounds of two Empires: these officers,
and the cause of them, the wars, are quite extinct.

SCOTLAND.
SCOTLAND is the Northern part of Britain, and separated from England by the
rivers Tweed, and Solway; and the Cheuiot hills extending from the one to the
other. It is in length (according to Polidor) 480 miles, but of no great
breadth; there being no place distant from the Seas 60 miles; and the Country
ending like the sharp point of a wedge.

There is in all o^ most of our British Maps, a great oversight committed,
which I could wish were reformed: for whereas Scotland is by the best
judgments reckned to be 160 longer then England; England is in these Mappes
made well nigh 100 miles longer then Scotland.

The denomination is taken, not as fabulous antiquaries think from Scota
daughter to an Egyptian Pharaoh; but from the Scoti, Scy^t^, or Scythi, a
people of Germany, over whose Northern bounds the name of Scythia did once
extend. These first ce^zed on a part of Spain, next on Ireland, and Anno 424,
on the West of this Country. More of this theme may be read in M. Camden, who
most iudiciously confuteth the absurd fables, and groundeth his relations upon
more then probable truths.

The Country is divided into the Highland and the Lowland. The people of the
former are either living on the Western co^tinent of Scotland, and have some
smacke of ciuility; or in the Out-Iles, which (as his Majesty has in his Bas:
Doron) are all utterly barbarous, and are no ways to be reduced to ciuility,
but by planting Colonies of the more inland and orderly Scots amongst them.
The Lowlanders bordering on the East are of the like ingenious dispositions and
language, almost with the English. They are the offspring of the Saxons, as
evidently does appear, 1 by their behavior; 2 their language; and thirdly by
the testimony of the Highlanders (who are the true Scots, and speak the Irish
tongue) who call both the Lowlanders, and the English, Saxons. And very
probable it is (for so much I have heard a judicious Gentleman of this nation
affirm) the Scots and Saxons invading this Island nigh at the same time; that
the Saxons might seize upon the Eastern parts, confronting their country; as
that the Scots did possess the Western side, which lay next unto Ireland and
the Western Islands, from whence they first came into Britain.

Scotland is far more barren then England. The chief commodities are course
clothes, Freezes, Fish, Hides, Lead-oare, etc.

The Gospel was first preached here by Palladius, Ano 431: they now follow the
reformation begun by Luther, and seconded or perfected by Zuinglius and Calvin.

The people had not long since one barbarous custom: which was, if any two
were displeased, they expected no law; but banged it out bravely, one and his
kindred, against the other and his, and thought the King much in their common,
if they granted him at a certain day to keep the peace. This fighting they
call their Feides* a word so barbarous, that were it to be expressed in
Latin, or French, it must be by circumlocution. These deadly feids, his
Majesty in his most excellent Basilicon Doron, advises his son to redress
with all care possible; but God has given him a long life, to see it in his
own days remedied* wherein he has gotten a greater victory over that people,
then ever any foreign Prince, or any of his predecessors: an act indeed
truly royal, and worthy himself. An other custom they once had of that
nature, that the like has hardly been in Christendom; which took beginning
as the Scottish historians affirm, in the reign of Ewen the 3d, who is the
fifteenth King in their Catalogue, after the first Fergus. This Ewen being a
Prince much addicted, or rather wholly given over unto lasciviousness; made a
law that himself and his successors should have the maidenhead or first
nights lodging with every woman, whose husband held land immediately from the
crown: and the Lords and Gentlemen of all them, whose husbands were their
tenants or homagers. This was it seems the Knights service, which men held
their estates by; and continued till the days of Malcolme Comnor, who at the
request of his wife Margaret (she was the sister of Edgar Etheling) abolished
this law: ordaining that the tenants by way of commutation, should pay unto
their Lords a mark in money, which tribute the historians say is yet in force.
It was called Marcheta mul^eris: but whether from Mar^, a horse in the old
Gall^que, (implying the obscene signification of Equitare) as M. Seldom
thinks: or Marca the sum of money by which it was afterward redeemed I cannot
determine.

The principal rivers are 1 Forthea. 2 Clada. and 3 Tay, all nauigable. The
famous or miraculous things rather of this country, are 1 the Lake of Mirton;
part of whose waters do congeale in winter, part of them not: 2ly the Lake of
Len^ox 24 miles round, in which are 30 Islands, one of which is driven to and
fro in every tempest. 3ly the deafestone 12 foot high, and 33 cubi^s thick; of
this rare quality, that a musket shot off on the one side, cannot be heard by a
man, standing on the other.

The Ancients were first the Gadeni, containing Tiuidale, Tivedale, Mer^h, and
Lothien. 2ly the Selgovae of Lidisdale, Eusdale, Eskdale, Anansdale, and
Nidisdale. 3l^ The Novantes, of Gallowa^e, Carrect, K^le, and Cunningham. 4ly
The Damnij of Clu^dsdale, Stri^eling, M^nteth, and F^fe. 5ly The Caledonij, of
S^ratherne, Argile, Cantire, Albanie, Lorne, Perth, and Anguis. 6ly The
Vernines of Mernis, and Mar. 7ly The Talzali of Buquh^. 8ly The Vacomagi, of
Loquabre and Murray. 9ly Cantae of Rosse and Sutherland. 10ly The Catine of
Cathnes. And lastly the Cornubij of Strathnaverne, the farthest Country
Northwa^d of all Britain.

These Provinces are divided 1 into diverse Sherifdomes, which being hereditary,
are a great hinderance to the execution of justice, so that there is no way to
remedy this mischief, so speeding, as when they are escheated, to dispose of
them according to the laudable custom of England. 2ly Into 13 Dioceses of
Ecc^esiasticall government, which division was made by Malcome the third Anno
1070. the Bishops before exercising their ^unctions, in what place soever they
came. Archbishops they had none till the year 1478; the Bishops of York being
before the Metropolitans of Scotland.

The greatest friends of the Scots were the French, to whom the Scots showed
themselves so faithful, that the French King commits the defense of his
person, to a selected number of Scottish Gentlemen: and so valiant, that they
have much hindered the English victories in France. And certainly the French
feeling the ^mart of the English puissance alone, have continually heart^ed the
Scots in their attempts against England; and hindered all meane^ of making union
between them: as appeared when they broke the match agreed on, between our
Edward the sixth, and Mary the young Queen of Scotland; but now this great
matter is happily effected. Their greatest enemy was the English, who overcame
them in many battles, ceazed on the kingdom, and had longer kept it, if the
mountains and inaccessible woods had not been more true to the Scots, then
their own valor: for so much his Majesty seems to intimate in his speech
at Whiteh^ll 1607. And though (says he) the Scot^es have had the honor and
good fortune never to be conquered; yet were they never but on the defensive
side, and may in part thank their hills and inaccessible passages, that saved
them from an utter overthrow, at the hands of all them that ever pretended to
conquer them. But I am cuncti gens vna sumus, sic simu^ in aevum,
One only nation now are we,
And let us so for ever be.


The chief Cities are Edinburgh, of old called Castrum Alatum in Lothien,
where is the Kings palace, and the Court of justice. It consists chiefly of
one street, extending in length one mile; into which run many petty lanes: so
that the whole compass may be well nigh 3 miles. It formerly belonged to the
English, from whom oppressed with the Danish tyrannies, the Scots took it,
Anno 960. 2 Glasco in Cluidsdale, an Archbishops See; and an University,
founded 1554* by Bishop Turnbull, 3 S. Andrews in Fife, honored with the same
prerogatives. It is called in Latin Fanum R^guli, and took both this and the
English name on this occasion. The bones of S. Andrew the Apostle, were
translated from Patra in Morea, where he did suffer martyrdom, unto
Constantinople: from whence they were brought hither by Albat^u Regulus a
Monk, Anno 378. He built over them a monastery, which after grew to be a
City; called in memory of the founder Fanum Reguli; in memory of the Saint, S*
Andrew. The Bishop hereof is the Metropolitan of all Scotland. 4 Sterling (or
Striueling) in the hundred so called; near unto which happened the most notable
discomfiture, that ever the Scots gave the English: who besides many Lords, and
700 Knights and Gentlemen of note, lost, as the Scottish writers say, 50000 of
the common sort (ours acknowledge 10000 only) the King himself (who then was
Edward the 2d) being faigne to sly for his life. Some Scottish writers affirm
the purer silver which we call Sterling money, to have bin h^re coined. We may
as well say that all our Silver bullion, comes from Bullion in France. The
truth is, that that denomination came from the Germans, of their easterly
dwelling, termed by us Easterlings: whom King John first drew into England, to
refine and purify our silver. 5 Aberdon in Mar. 6 Dond^^ in Ang^is. 7 Perth,
or S. John's town.

This kingdom contained once two populous nations; Scots and Picts What the
former were has already been said; the latter (to omit the confutation of
them who hold them to be descended from the Agathirsi, of Scythia) were very
Britains: who when the Roman Eagle had with her black wings darkened the
South part of the Island; fled into the Northern pa^ts, as preferring penurious
liberty before fetters of gold. These men using the ancient custom of painting
their bodies, after their Countrymen had conformed themselue^ to more civil
courses: were by the Romans called Picti. they long swaied here alone, till the
year 424; in which the Scots now grown populous, did first set footing in
Britain: with whom at their first arrival, they contracted an offensive and
defensive league, against the Britains; whom on all sides they most miserably
tortured. It happened at the last that Achaius married Fergusia, sister to
Hungust King of the Picts; by her he had issue Alpine: who after the death of
Hungust dying without issue, was in the judgment of the Scots, to succeed in
the Pictish Kingdom. But the Picts alleging a law of not admitting Aliens to
the crown, chose one Ferereth for their king; with whom A^pine warring, was
after many victorious exploits slain. This quarrel thus begun, was
maintained by their successors, till after many bloody victories, and
overthrows on both sides; Kenneth K. of the Scots vanquished Donsken King of
the Picts, and extinguished not only their kingdom, but their very name:
(unless we will believe that some of them did fly into France, and there
forsooth vanquished, and inhabited the Countries called now Pictavia and
Picardie.) From this Kenneth the first Monarch of all Scotland, we will begin
our Catalogue; leaving out that rabble of Kings mentioned by Hector Boethius, in
his hist^ry of this kingdom and nation. Neither shall I herein I hope offend
the more judicious sort of the Scottish nation, especially since I deal no
more unkindly with their Scota, and her successors; then I have done already
with our own Brutus, and his. The first Scottish King that settled himself in
the North of Britain, is according to the aboue-named Hector Boethius, one
Fergus; which in the time that Coil governed the Brittans, came, forsooth,
into these parts out of Ireland. From him unto Eugenius, we have the names of
39 kings in a continued succession; which Eugenius, together with his whole
nation, is said to have been expelled the Island, by a joint confederacy of
the Romans, Brit^ns, and Picts. Twenty and seven years after the death of this
Eugenius, they were reduced again into their possession here, by the valor
and conduct of one Fergus the 2d of that name. To this Fergus I refer the
beginning of the Scottish kingdom in Britain, holding the stories of the
former 39 Kings, to be fabulous and vain: neither want I probable conjecture
for this assertion; this expedition of Fergus into Britain, being placed in
the 424 year of Christ, at what time the best writers hold the Scots to have
first seated themselves in this Island. The king of chief note between this
Fergus, and Kenneth the first Monarch of all Scotland; was Achaius: who
contracted the offensive and defensive league with Charles the great, between
the kingdoms of France and Scotland. The conditions whereof were. 1 Let this
league between the two kingdoms endure for ever. 2 Let the enemies unto one
be reputed and handled as the enemies of the other. 3 If the Saxons, or
Englishmen invade France, the Scots shall send thither such numbers of
Soldiers, as shall be desired: the French King defraying the charges. 4 If the
English invade Scotland, the King of France shall at his own charges, send
competent assistance unto the King of Scotland. Never was there any league,
which was either more faithfully observed or longer continued, then this
between these two kingdoms: The Scots on all occasions so readily assisting
the French, that it grew to a proverb, or by word, he that will France win
must with Scotland first begin.

Now before I come unto Kenneth, I will in this place relate the story of
Machbed, one of his successors: a history then which for variety of action, or
strangeness of event, I never met with any more pleasing. The story in brief
is thus D^ncan King of Scotland, had two principal men whom he employed in all
matters of importance; Machbed and Banquho. These two traveling together
through a forest were met by three Fairies, or Witches ( Weirds the Scots
call them) whereof the first making obeisance unto Machbed, saluted him Thane
(a title unto which that of Earl afterward succeeded) of Glammis, the second,
Thane of Cawder. and the third, King of Scotland. This is unequal dealing said
Banquho, to give my friend all the honors and none unto me: to whom one of the
Weirds made answer, that he indeed should not be King, but out of his loins
should come a race of kings that should for ever rule Scotland. And having thus
said they all suddenly vanished. Upon their arrival to the Court, Machbed was
immediately created Thane of Glammis; and not long after, some new service of
his requiring new recompense, he was honored with the title of Thane of
Cawder. Seeing then how happily the prediction of the three Weirds fell out in
the two former; he resolved not to be wanting to himself in fulfilling the
third; and therefore first he killed the King, and after by reason of his
command among the Soldiers and common people, he succeeded in his throne.
Being scarce warm in his seat, he called to mind the prediction given to his
companion Banquho, whom hereupon suspecting as his supplanter he caused to be
killed, together with his whole kindred, Fleance his son only with much
difficulty escaping into Wales. Freed now from this fear, he built Dunsinane
Castle making it his ordinary seat: and afterward on new fears consulting with
certain wizards about his future estate; was by one told that he should never
be overcome till Bernane wood (which was some few miles distant) did come to
Dunsinane Castle: and by the other that he never should be slain by any man
borne of a woman. Secure then as he thought, he omitted no kind of
libidiuousnesse or cruelty for the space of 18 years, for so long he reigned,
or to say better, tyrannized. Mackduffe governor of Fife, joining to himself
some few Patriots, which had not yet felt the tyrants sword; privily met one
night at Bernane wood, and early in the morning marched, every man bearing a
bough in his hand the better to keep them from discovery; toward Dunsinane
Castl^; which they presently took by s^aladoe. Machbed escaping, was pursued,
overtaken, and urged to fight by Mackduffe; to whom the tyrant half in scorn
replied* that ^n v^ine he attempted his death: for it was his destiny never to
b^ slain by any man borne of a woman. Now then is thy fatal hour come, said
Mackduffe, for I was never borne of a woman, but violently cut out of my
mothers belly, she dying before her delivery: which words so danted the tyrant,
though otherwise a man of good performance, that he was easily slain; and
Malcolme Conmor the true heir of the Crown, seated in the throne. In the
mean time Fleance so thriued in Wales that he fell in love with the Welsh
Princes daughter, and on her begat a son named Walter. This Walter flying
Wales for a murder, was entertained in Scotland, and his descent once known,
he was preferred to be Steward unto King Edgar, from which office the name of
Steward became as the surname of all his posterity. From this Walter descended
that Robert Steward, who was after in right of his wife, King of Scotland;
since which time there have been successively nine Sovereigns of this name in
Scotland. But it is now high time (the prophecies being fulfilled, and my story
finished) to attend King Kenneth, and his successors.

and bloody war for the kingdom of Scotland; between the husbands of the
last Kings three Neices. And when they could not amongst themselves compose the
difference; they referred the cause to our Edward the first, as to the supreme
sovereign of that kingdom; and he selecting 12 Scottish, and 12 English
Counselors, with general consent of all adjudged it to John Baliol, husband
to the late Kings nighest kinswoman. 1300 24 John Baliol an Englishman; but
forgetful both of English birth and English courtesies, he invaded the
kingdom of England in hostile manner, and was taken prisoner, 6. 1036 25
Robert Bruce husband to the second sister, succeeded by the general consent of
the Scots; but he being dead, our Edward the third settled S. Ed. Baliol in the
kingdom. 24. 1332 26 Edw. Baliol son to John Baliol, was rejected by the
Scots for adhering too closely to our Edward; who therefore harried Scotland
with fire and sword. 10. 1342 27 David Bruce seated by the Scots, was an utter
enemy to the English; and inuading England when Edward the third was at the
seige of Calice: he was taken prisoner by Queen Philip, 29. 1371 28 Robert
Steward King of the Scots, in right of his wife being eldest sister to the last
King, was descended from the ancient Princes of Wales, thereby restoring the
British blood unto the Scottish throne, 19. 1390 29 Robert III. 16. 1406 30
James taken prisoner by our Henry the fourth, as he was going to the Court of
France. In his absence Robert Duke of Albanie governed Scotland 18 years; and
this King being enlarged by our Henry the fifth, reigned 24 years more. 1448 31
James II, 14. 1462 32 James III. 29. 1491 33 James IV. he was married unto
Margaret, eldest daughter to Henry the seventh; yet he against the peace, and
all reason, invaded England with 100000 men; he was met with by the Earl of
Surrey (having 26000 men in his Army) nigh unto Flodden; where he was slain,
together with two Bishops, 12 Earls, 14 Lords, and his whole Army routed. 23.
1514 34 James V. This man inheriting his Fathers hatred against the English,
invaded their borders in the year 1542 and was met by the Lord Wharton, then
Warden of the West Marches. The battles being ready to join, one S^ Oliver
Sincleer the Kings favorite, though otherwise of mean paren^age, was by the
Kings directions proclaimed General: which the Scottish Nobility took with
such indignation, that they threw down their weapons, and suffered themselves
to be taken prisoners, there being not one man slain on either side. The
principal prisoners were the Earls of Glencarne and Cassiles, the Barons
Maxwell, Oliphant, Somervell, Flemming, with diverse others; besides many of the
Gentry. He reigned 28 years 1542 35 Mary, an unfortunate Princess, was first
married to Francis the second of France, by whom having no issue she was
remarried to Henry L. Darnly. 1567 36 JAMES the VI, son to Mary Queen of
Scotland and Henry L. Darnly, was crowned King before the death of his mother:
he took to wife Anne daughter unto Christierne King of Danemarke; and was
called to the Crown of England after the death of Queen Elizabeth, upon the 24
of March 1603 Here can I not o^it the prudent foresight of Henry the seventh
who having two daughters to marry, bestowed the elder on the King of Scotland,
and the younger on the King of France; that if his own issue male should
fail, and a Prince of another nation must inherit England; then Scotland as
the lesser kingdom should follow and depend upon England; and not Engl^nd wait
on France, as on the greater. Neither will I here pass over the prophecy,
attributed in the Polychronicon, unto an holy Anchoret that lived in King
Egelred his time, which is this* English men for that they wonneth them to
drunkenness, to treason, and ^o rechlessenesse of Gods house; first by Danes,
and then by Normans, and the third time by Scots, whom they holden least worth
of all, they shallen be overcome. Then the world shall be unstable, and so
diverse and variable, that the unstableness of thoughts shall be betokened by
manny manner diversity of clothing. Certainly by this happy union of the
kingdoms is this prediction accomplished; the circumstances of time so patly
agreeing, and the Scots never subduing England, but by this blessed victory.
The principal order of Knighthood in this kingdom is of S. Andrew,
instituted by Hung^us King of the Picts, to hearten his subjects against
Athelstane King of England. The Knights wear about their necks a collar
interlaced with Thistles, with the picture of S. Andrew pendant to it. It took
this name because after the battle, Hungius and his Soldiers went all
barefoot to S. Andrew; and there vowed that they and all their posterity, would
thenceforth use his Cross as their ensign, when soever they took in hand any
warlike expedition. The word is Nemo me impune lacessit.

The revenues of this Crown Boterus writes to be not above 100000 Crowns;
and though they were far more, yet certainly not comparable to those of
England: here being no commodity in this kingdom to allure strangers to
traffic; 2ly, The Country it self being barren. and 3ly, Many of the
subjects, those especially of the Western parts, and out Isles, so unwieldy,
that they cannot be very beneficial to the treasury.

The Arms are Sol, a lion rampant Mars, within a double tressure
counterflowred. This tressure counterflowred was added to the Lion by Achaius
King of Scotland, at what time he contracted the perpetual league with France;
signifying (says H^ctor Boethius) Francorum opibus leonem exinde esse muni^^dum.

IRELAND.
Maginus.
IRELAND environed on all sides with the Sea, stands West of Britain; next
unto which, it is the biggest Island of Europe, containing in length 400, and in
breadth 200 miles. It is situate under the 10th and 12th Climates, the longest
day being 16 hou^es and more.

Camden.
The Island has by some bin termed Scotia, because the Scotti coming from
Spain, dwelt there. The most usual name amongst old writers, is Iernia; the
modern, Hibernia; the English, Ireland; and though some frame a wrested
Etymology from Iberus a Spanish Captain, some from Irnalph a Duke hereof, and
others ab Hyberno aere, the winter-like and cold air; yet certainly the name
proceeds from Erinland, which in their old language signifies a western
land.

Their own Chronicles, or Fables rather, tell us, how Caesarea, Noah's Niece,
inhabited here before the Flood; and how 300 years after the Flood, it was
subdued by Bartholanus a Scythian, who overcame here I know not what Giants.
Afterward Nemethus an other Scythian Prince, and Delus a Gracian, came hither;
and last of all Gaothel, with his wife S^ota, one of the Pharaohs daughters,
who must needs name this Island Scotia. Not to honor such fopperies with a
confutation, doubtlesly the first inhabitants of this Island came out of
Britain. For Britain is the ^ighest Country unto it, and so had a more
speedy wastage hither; secondly, the ancient Writers call this Island, a
British Island; and thirdly, Tacitus gives us of this Country this verdict,
Solum, coelumque, cultus and ingenia homi^um, hand multum a Britannia
differunt; the habits and disposition of the people were not much unlike the
Britains.

The people are generally strong and nimble of body, haughty of heart,
careless of their lives, patient of cold and hunger, implacable in enmity,
constant in love, light of belief, greedy of glory; and in a word, if they be
bad, you shall nowhere find worse; if they be good, you shall hardly meet
with better. But more particularly both men and women within the Pal^, and such
places where the English discipline is heartily embraced, are conformable to
ciuility; the Kernes (for by that name they call the wild Irish) extremely
barbarous; not behauing themselves as Christians, scarcely as men.

They use the Irish language, spoken also in the West of Scotland, and the
Hebrides or western Islands. They received the Christian faith by the preaching
of S. Patricke, Anno 335. At this present, the more civil sort follow the
reformation according to the Church of England; but the Kernes either adhere to
the Pope, or to their own superstitious fancies.

The soil of it self is abundantly fruitful, as may be seen in such places,
where the industry of man plays the midwife with the earth, in helping her to
bring forth; but on the contrary, where agriculture, and laborious manuring of
the ground is deficient, there also the fruits of the earth are not, and cannot
be abundant.

Famous has this Country bin in former times for the piety and religious lives
of the Monks; amongst whom I cannot but remember Columban, and of him this
memorable apothegme: He being offered many fair preferments to leave his
Country, replied, It becomes not them to embrace other men's riches, that for
Christ's sake had forsaken their own. But now I should sooner find piety
amongst the Cannibals of America, then the Kernes of Ireland.

Amongst other prerogatives of this Island, this is one, that it breeds no
venomous serpent; neither will any live here, brought from other Regions. Hence
of her self she thus speaks, Illa ego sum Graijs Glacialis Hibernia dicta,
Cui Deus and melior rerum nascentium origo.
Ius commune dedit, cum Creta altrice Tonantis,
Angues ne nostris diffundant sibila in oris.
I am that Island, which in times of old
The Greeks did call Hibernia y^^e-cold:
Secured by God and Nature from this fear,
Which gift was given to Crete Jove's mother dear,
That poisonous snakes should never here be bred,
Or dare to hiss or hurtful venom shed.
The other miraculous things in Ireland are, 1 all the breed of it, (except
women and Gray-hounds) are lesser then in England. Maginus.
2ly, there is a lake above Armach, into which if one thrust a piece of wood,
he shall find that part which remains in the mud, converted to iron; and that
which continues in the water, turned to a whet-stone: which, if those reports
be false, is worthily deserved of their first authors. Thirdly, the Kine will
yield no milk, unless their calves are by them, or their calves skins
stuffed with hey or straw.

Camden.
The state of the Clergy has bin little beholding to fortune: In former times
some of the Bishops had no more revenewes then the pasture of two milch Kine:
and now the violent stomachs of Impropriatours, have so far devoured that
which our Ancestors consecrated to religious uses, as the glory of God, and
the maintenance of his Ministers: that in the whole Province of Connaght, the
stipend of the incumbent is not above 40 shillings, in some places but 15
shillings. So that the Irish must needs be better fed then taught; for ad
tenuitatem beneficiorum necessario sequitur ignorantia sacerdotum; and the
poor Vicars plea deserves to be heard, their case pitied, their estate
amended*

The chief rivers are 1 Shennin or Sinei, which beginning in Vlster, runs
the course of 200 miles, to the Verginian Sea, and is nauigable 60 miles. 2 The
Slane. 3 Awiduff, called by the English, Blackwater. 4 Shower. These and the
other rivers of principal note, take along with you, according as I find them
registered by that excellent Poet M. Spencer, in his Canto of the marriage of
Thames and Medwaie, There was the Liffie rolling down the lea,
The sandi^ Slane, the stony Aubrian,
The spacious Shenin spreading like a sea,
The pleasant Boyne, the fishie-fruitfull Banne,
Swift Awiduffe, which of the Englishman
Is called Blackwater; and the Liffar deep,
Sad Trowis that once his people overrun,
Strong Allo tumbling from Slewtogher steep,


And Mulla mine, whose waves I whilome taught to weep.

There also was the wide embayed Mayre,
The pleasant Bandon crowned with many a wood,
The spreading Lee that like an Island fair,
Encloseth Cork with his divided flood;
And balefull Our, late stained with English blood:
With many more, etc,
The principal lakes (of which this Island is full) are Lough Earne, Lough
Foil, and Lough Corbes, in length 20, in breadth 4 miles, in which are 300
Ilets abundant in Pine-trees.

Ireland is divided into 5 Provinces, which formerly were Kingdoms, viz: 1
MUNSTER has on the East Lemster, on the West and South the Sea, and on the
North Connaght: It is divided into the Counties of Kerrie, Waterford, Desmond,
Cork, Tiperarie, and Holy Cross. The chief Cities are, 1 Limericke on the
banks of Shennin. 2 Cork. 3 Kinsall, which was fortified in the last Irish
troubles by Don John d' Aquila, and a Spanish Garrison, and 4 Waterford on the
Shoure. 2 CONNAGHT has on the East Meth, on the West the Sea, on the North
Vlster, on the South Mounster. It is divided into the Counties of Mato,
Twomond, Galway, Slego, Roscoman, and Letrim, this last belonging once to the O
Rorkes. The chief Cities are 1 Bunratti. 2 Gallway, the third City of Ireland
for fairness and largeness. 3 VLSTER has on the South Meth and Connaght, on
all other parts, the Sea. It is divided into the Countries of Louth, Canan,
Fermanagh, Down, Monagham, Armach, Antrim, Tirconnel, Colran, and Tir Oen,
whose rebellious Earls have bin so long traitors to England, and disturbers
of the Islands quiet. The chief Cities are 1 Dundalke in Louth. 2 Dungannon,
the residence of the great Onecles. 3 Arma^th, the seat of an Archbishop, one
of whom is famous for writing against the lives of the Roman Clergy. 4 Dongall
in Tir Connell; and a London Derrie, built and peopled by the Citizens of
London. 4 METH has on the East the Sea, on the West Conaght, on the North
Vlster, and on the West Lemster. It is divided into the Counties of East-Meth,
West-Meth, and Long-ford. The chief towns of it are 1 Kellye. 2. Trim. and 3
Tredagh. 5 LEMSTER has on the East and South the Sea, on the West Conaght, on
the North Meth. It is divided into the Counties of Kilkennie, Caterlogh,
Kildare, Kings County, or Ophalie, Queens County or Lease, W^isbford, and
Dublin, The chief Towns are 1 Mary Bourg in Lease. 2 Philips town in Ophali^.
9 Kildare, one of whose Earls was complained of to Henry the eight, and when
his adversary concluded his invectiue, with, Finally all Ireland cannot rule
this Earl; the King replied, then shall this Earl rule all Ireland; and so
for his ^ests sake he made him deputy. 4 Dublin seated on the L^ffie, is the
Metropolis of Ireland, the residence of the Lord Deputy, the Sea of an
Archbishop, and an University. It was built by Harald Harfager, the first King
of Norwey, and after the English conquest, was peopled by a Colony of our
Bristoll men.


The whole number of Counties in Ireland is 32, in every of which is a
Sheriff, and diverse Justices of peace, as in England. They are governed after
the Laws of England: and formerly their grieuances were referred to, and their
Statutes enacted at our Parliaments; but now the Deputy has power of assemble
the States, and make what Laws, or reform what customs the necessity of the
time requires.

Ireland once was divided into five several Kingdoms, and first suffered a
foreign power under Turgesius and his Norwegians, who were soon rooted out by
the policy of the petty king of Meth, who was the only Irish Prince in favor
with the tyrant. This king of Meth, (by name Omalaighlilen) had to daughter a
woman of renowned beauty, whom Turgesius lusting after, demanded of her father
to be his Concubine. The Methian Prince unwilling to grant, yet daring not to
deny this petition, or, to say better command, for such are tyrants petitions)
made answer, that he had in his tuition besides his daughter, a beuie of most
beautiful Virgins, out of which he should choose as many as he pleased for his
private pleasures. Turgesius rejoicing at this motion, desired him with all
speed to effect this meeting. But the King of Meth attiring in the habits of
women, a company of young Gentlemen, who durst for the common liberty, adventure
their several lives, conducted them into the tyrants bedchamber. And they
according to the directions given the^, when for that little modesties sake he
had in him, he had commanded all his attendants to avoid the room: assaulted
him now ready for, and expecting more kind embraces; and left him dead in the
place. The Methian King had by this time, acquainted diverse of the better sort
with his plot; all which upon a sign given, rush into the palace, and put to
death all the Norwegians, and other attendants of this tyrant. After this the
Roytel^ts enjoyed their former dominions, till the year 1172, in which Dermot
Mac Morock king of Lemster, having forced the wife of Maurice O Rorke king of
Meth, and being by him driven out of his kingdom, came to the Court of England
for succor. To this petition, Henry the second, then King, condescended,
sending him aid under the leading of William Strongbow Earl of Penbrooke, who
restored King Dermot, and brought a great part of the Island under the English
subjection. John king of England was the first who was entitled the L. of
Ireland, which style was granted him by Pope Urban the 3d, who for the ornament
of his royalty, sent him a Plume of Peacocke feathers, (and when Tir Oen styled
himself Defender of the Irish liberty, he was by the then Pope honored with
the like present.) The Kings of England retained this title of Lords til the
year 1542, in which Henry the 8th in an Irish Parliament, was declared K. of
Ireland, as a name more ^acred, and repleat with Majesty, then that of Lord:
at which time also he was declared to be the supreme head under God of the
Church of Ireland; and the people utterly disclaymed all the pretended
jurisdiction of the Popes of Rome. Since the first plantation there, of our
English people, the Country haeh bin governed by a Viceroy (whom we usually
call the Lord Deputy) then whom there comes no Vicegerent in Europe more
near the Majesty and prerogative of a King. These Deputies notwithstanding the
large extent of their commission, could never wholly subdue the Island, or bring
the people to any civil course of life: the fathers inflicting a heavy curse
on al their posterity, if ever they should sow corn, build houses, or learn
the English tongue To this ind^sposition of the Irish themselves, let us a^ the
defects of the kings o^ England, and Irish Deputies in matter of civil
policy, as I find them particularized by Sir John Dauies, in his worthy and
p^thy discourse of this subject. I will only glean a few of them. First then, a
barbarous country is like a field ouer-grown with weed, which must first be
well broken with the plough, and then immediately sown with good and profitable
seed: so must a wild and uncivil people be first broken and ploughed up by
war, and then presently sown with the seed of good laws and discipline:
lest the weeds revive in the one, and ill manners in the other. Here then was
the first defects in our English Kings, not to tame and take down the stomach
and pride of this people; though either civil or foreign wars perhaps
occasioned this neglect: and also of the Ir^sh Deputies, who at such times as
the people upon a smal^ discomfiture, were crest-falne, neglected the so
keeping of them by severity of discipline. The 2d ouer-sight concerns
particularly our kings, who gave such large possessions and regalities unto the
first conquerours, that the people knew no authority in a manner, above their
immediate Lords. 3ly The Laws of England were not indifferently communicated to
all the Irishrie, but to some particular Families and Provinces only; whereby
the rest of the people being in the condition of outlawes, or at the best of
aliens, knew not how to behave themselves as subjects: and this concerns the
Kings also. The 4th defect was particularly in the deputies, who having made
good and wholsom^ laws against the barbarous customs of the common people,
and inhumane oppression of the Lords; never put them in execution: as if they
had bin made rather for a terror, or a show, then any intent of use or benefit
to the state. And to these four may most of the rest be reduced.

In these terms of wildnes and non-subjection stood ^reland, until toward the
end of the reign of Q. Eliza^eth, at what time began the rebellion of Tirone,
who engaged the greatest part of the Irishrie, both Lords and commons in that
action; which ending in the ouer-throw of that ungrateful rebel, not only
^rushed the overmuch powerablenesse of the Irish Nobility; but made the final
and full conquest of the whole Nation. So true is it that Every rebel^ion when
it is surprest, does make the Prince stronger, and the subjects weaker. Ireland
thus broken and ploughed, that glorious Q^eene died, a Victor over all enemies;
and lest the sowing of it unto his Majesty now reigning, who omitted no part of
a skillful seedesman. First then there was an (...), or Act of oblivion made,
whereby all the offenses against the Crown were remitted, if by such a limited
day the people would sue out their pardons: and by the same Act, all the
Irishrie were manu-mitted from the servitude of their Lords, and received into
the kings immediate protection. 2ly the whole kingdom was divided into shires,
and Judges Itinerant appointed to circuit them; whereby it has followed that
the exactions of the Lords are laid aside, the behavior of the people is
narrowly looked into, the passages before unknown unto our Soldiers, are
laid open by our vnder-Sheriffes and Bayliffes; and the common people seeing
the bene^it and security they enjoy by the English Laws, and loath to plead
always by an Interpreter, begin to set their children to School, for the
learning of the English tongue. 3ly, the Irish were not rooted out, as in the
first plantation in Leimster, and the English only estated in their ^oomes: but
were only removed from the woods, bogs, and mountains, into the plain and
open country; that being like wild trees transplanted, they might grow the
milder, and bear the better fruit. And 4ly, whereas there was before but one
freeholder in a whole country, which was the lord himself, the rest holding in
villenage, and being subject to the lords immeasu^able taxations; whereby they
had no encouragement to build or plant. Now the lords estate was divided into
two parts, that which he held in demean to himself, which was still left unto
him; and that which was in the hands of hi^ tenants, who had estates ^ade in
their possessions according to the Common law of England, paying instead of
uncertain Irish taxations, certain English rents: whereby the people have since
set their minds upon repairing their houses, and manuring their lands, to the
great increase of the private and public revenue.

Thus have you seen Ireland, which before served only as a grave to bury our
best men, and a gulse to swallow our greatest treasures; being governed neither
as a country free nor conquered; brought in some hope by the prudence and
policy of her present king and late Deputies, to prove an orderly
Commonwealth, civil in it self, profitable to be the Prince, and a good
strength to the British Empire. For how wayfaring men travel without danger,
the ploughman walks without fear, the laws ar^ administered in every place
alike, the men are drawn unto villages, the woods and fastness left to
beasts, and all reduced to that ciuility, as our fathers never saw, nor can we
well sample out of ancient historits.

The revenues of this kingdom are said by Walsingham, in the time of Edward
the third, to have been yearly 40000 pounds; but his successors to this
present age, have scarce got so much as the keeping of it cost them; King
Richard the 2d being by the same Walsingham reported, to have spent 30000
marks out of his own purse, over and above the money which he received there.
Whether this Country were so profitable to Edward 3d or not, I dare not
determine: certain I am, that the revenues at this time are double what they
were before; and more orderly paid into the Exchequer then ever: the
customehouse yielding yearly no less then 30000 pounds.

The Arms of Ireland are B, an Irish harp O, stringed A: which coat his now
Majesty to show himself the first absolute King of Ireland, Guilliam.

THE LESSER ISLANDS.
Camden.
THE LESSER ISLANDS are the Orcades. Sorlinges. Hebrides. Sporades.


THE ORCADES.
THE ORCADES or Isles of Orkney, are in number 32, and are situate against the
most Northern Cape of Scotland, the chief of which is Pomonia, whose prime
town is Kirkwall, honored with a Bishops See, and strengthened with two
castles. This Island is well stoared with tin and lead, and is at this day by
the Inhabitants called Mainland. The second Island of note is Hethy, called by
Ptolomy, Ocetis. The people are (according to Maginus) great drinkers, but no
drunkards, bibacissimi sunt incolae, nunquam tamen inebriantur: they use the
Gothish language, which they derive from the Norwegians, in whose possession
they once were, and of whose qualities they still retain some smacke. These
Isles in Solinus time were not inhabited, being ouer-grown with rushes; now they
are in a measure populous and fertile; and were first discovered by Julius
Agricola, the first that ever sailed about Britain. In latter times they were
possessed by the Normans or Norwegians, who held them till the year 1266: when
Magnus King of Norwey surrendered them up to Alexander King of Scotland; which
surrendrie, some of the succeeding Kings did afterward ratify.

Two days sailing North of these Orcades, lies Shetland, an Island belonging
to the Crown of Scotland; and is by many supposed to be the Thyle of the
Ancients. For first it stands in the 63 degrees of latitude, in which
Ptolomie places Thyle: 2ly it lies opposite to Bergen in Norwey, against
which Pomponius Mela has seated it: and 3ly Caspar Peucerus has observed,
that this Shetland is by mariners called Thylensell; a name in which that of
Thyle is apparently couched. That I and was not Thyle (as most say) we shall
anon show you.

THE HEBRIDES.
The HEBRIDES or HEBVDE, or Western Islands, because situate on the West side
of Scotland, are in number 44: the chief of which are Ila 24 miles long, and
16 broad, plentiful in Wheat, Cattle, and Herds of Red-deere. 2 Iona, famous
for the Sepulchers of the Scottish Kings, whose chief Town is S^dore. And 3
Mula, which is 25 miles bigger then the rest. The people both in language and
behavior resemble the Wild Irish, and are called Redshankes; a people, as his
Majesty in his Basilicon Doron teaches us, allutterly rude, and without all
show of ciuility; such as permit not themselves to be governed by the Laws,
nor to be kept under by Discipline, legum severitate, and iudiciorum metu se
illigari non patiuntur, says M. Camden. These Islands were also bought by
Alexander the third, of Magnus King of Norwey.

THE SORLINGES.
These Islands being called by the Belgians or Netherlanders SORLINGS; by the
English, Silly; by Antonine in his Itinerary Sigdeles, by Solinus, Silures; and
by some Greek Writers Hesperides, and Cassiterides: are situate over against
the most Western Cape of Cornwall, from which they are distant 24 miles: They
are in number 145, of which ten only are of any estimation, viz: 1 Armath. 2
Agnes 3 Sampson. 4 Silly, the name-giuer (as it seems) unto the rest. 5
Brefar, 6 Rusco. 7 S. Helens. 8 S. Martins. 9 Arthur, and 10 S. Mary's, the
chief of all the rest, as being eight miles in compass, sufficiently
fruitful, and strengthened with a castle called Stella Maria, built by Queen
Elizabeth, and by her furnished with a garrison. These Islands are well stored
with Grass, Grain, and Lead, which last from hence was first carried into
Greece. Hither the Roman Emperors banished condemned men to work in the
Mines. These Islands were subdued to the English Crown by Athelstane.

THE SPORADES.
I call not these Islands by this name, because they are memorized in any
Author, ancieut or modern, by this name; but because being many, Camden.
I know not in what general name I may more fitly include them: the chief of
which are 1 Man, 2 Anglesey, 3 Iarsie, 4 Gernsie, 5 Wight.

1 MAN is situate just over against the Southern part of Cumberland, from
which it is distant 25 miles, and was judged to belong to Britain rather then
to Ireland, because it fostred venomous serpents brought hither out of
Britain. It is in length 30 miles, in breadth 15 miles, and but 8 in some
places. The people hate theft, and begging; they use a language mixed of the
Norvegian and Irish tongues. The soil is abundant in Flax, Hemp, Oats,
Barley, and Wheat, with which they use to supply the defects of Scotland, if
not the Continent it self, yet questionless the Western Isles, which are a
member of it. For thus writes the Reverend Father in God, John Mericke, late
Bishop of this Island, in a letter to M. Camden, at such time as he was
composing his most excellent Brittania. Our Island (says he) for cattle, for
fish, and for corn, has not only sufficient for it self, but sends also
good store into other Countries; now what Countries should need this supply (
England and Ireland being aforehand with such provisions) except Scotland, or
some members thereof, I see not. Venerable Bede numbered in it 300 Families, and
now it is furnished with 17 Parish Churches. The chief Towns are 1 Balacuri,
and 2 Russin or Castle-towne, the seat of a Bishop, who though he be under the
Archbishop of York, yet has he no voice in the English Parliament. In this
Island is the hill Scea-full, where on a clear day one may see England,
Scotland, and Ireland: here also are bred the Bernacles or Soland Geese, of
rotten wood falling into the water. This Island was taken from the Britains by
the Scots, and from them regained by Edwin king of Northumberland; afterward
the Norwegians seized on it, from whom Alexander the third wrested it: and
about the year 1340. William Montacute Earl of Salisbury, descended from the
Norwegian kings of Man, won it from the Scots, and sold it to the Lord
Scroope; who being condemned of treason, Henry the fourth gave it to Henry
Percie Earl of Northumberland: but he also proouing false to his Sovereign,
it was given to the Stanlies; now Earls of Darbie.

2 ANGLESEY is counted a Shire of Wales, and bordereth on Carnarvonshire. It is
in length 20, in breadth 17 miles, containing in former times 360 villages and
Towns, of which the chief are Beaumar^sh toward Wales, 2 Newburg, and 3
Aberfraw, on the South Side. This Island for its abundant fertility in all
things necessary to preserve the life of man, is called the Mother of Wales. It
was once the seat of the Druides, first conquered by Suetonius Paulinus, and
united to the English Crown by the valor of Edward the first.

3 IARSEY is in compass 30 miles, and sufficiently strong, by reason of the
dangerous Seas. It contains 12 Towns or Villages, the chief being S.
Hilarie, and S. Malo. The ground is plentiful in grain, and Sheep, most of
them having 4 horns; of whose wool our true Iarsie Stockings are made. This
C^sarea or Iarsie, is ruled by a Governor appointed by the King of England, to
whom are added as assistants 12 men, selected out of every several Parish.

4 GERNSEY (formerly Sarnia) is distant 20 miles from Iarsey, to whom it is
far inferior in respect of fertility and largeness; but more commodious
because of her safe harbors. It contains 10 Parishes, the chief being S.
Peter's. These Islands lie both nigh unto Normandy and Britain; the people use
the French tongue, and are the only remainder of the English rights in France.
In their Ecclesiastical Discipline they follow the Church of Geneva, as most
affected by their French Ministers, and are both subject to the Diocese of
Winchester.

5 WIGHT is severed from Hampshire by a little narrow, and dangerous straight
of the Sea. It contains 20 miles in length, and 12 in breadth; the soil is
very answerable to the husbandmans expectation, the Sheep bear delicate fine
wool, and the trees store of fruit. Here are 2 Parkes, and one Forest, as
also 36 Towns and Villages, the principal being Newport, Yarmouth, and
Brading. The Island is very strongly seated and strengthened. The South part
toward France is inaccessible, by reason of the steepy and ruggie rocks which
there guard it; the North shore toward Hampshire is flat and level, and for
that cause fortified with three castles: viz: Yarmouth, the Cowes, and Sandhead
castle. In the midland there is Garesbrooke castle only, in which is provision
of armor for 5000 men; in every village is a great piece of Ordinance: yet are
not these external strengths so much available, as the internal animosity of
the inhabitants. It is subjected to the County of Southampton for her
government, and was taken from the Britains by Wolphar King of Mercia. Of
this Island Henry the sixth crowned Henry Beauchamp Earl of Warwick, king;
which title ended not long after in the death of this Beauchamp.

There are diverse other Islands, as Dennie, Londay, and Chaldey in the Severne
Sea: Than^t and Sheppie near Kent, Holyfarne, and Cockat Islands on the
confines of Northumberland; with many others, of which being of no account, I
forbear to make mention.

Thus much of the British Islands.

OF THE NORTHERN ISLANDS.
THe NORTHERN sea is by some called Mare Scythicum; by Iuvenal, Oceanus
Glacialis; by the Cimbrians in their tongue Marimorusa, that is, the dead sea;
and by Tacitus, Mare Pigrum. The Tacitus best describes it, and out of him I
afford it you. Trans Suionas mare aliud pigrum, and prope immotum quo etc.
Beyond the Swethlanders there is another sea so slow, and almost immovable,
that many think it to be the bounds which compass in the whole World. Quad^.
Some are persuade that the sound of the Sun is heard, as he rises, out of
this sea; and that many shapes of gods are seen, and the beams of his head
Illuc usque (and fama vera) tantum natura. At this sea (the report is credible)
is the end of nature and the world. The principal Islands dispersed in it are
Groenland. 2 Island 3 Freezland 4 Nova Zemla. 5 Sir Hugh Willoughbies Island.

1 GROENLAND is situate under the Northern cold Zone, the ongest day in Summer
being 3 months and a half: it is in length more then 600 miles. This Country
^is not yet sufficiently discovered, but generally known to abound in grass,
which nourishes great store of cattle: and gives air to a people dwelling in
caves, and delighting in Necromancie. The chief Town is S. Thome, and Alba the
next. In this Island the Londoners have met with a good trade of fishing; and
for that cause, further searching into it, and oftener frequenting it, have
given it the new name of King James his new land.

2 ISLAND is about 400 miles in length, a damnable cold Country, whence it
seems to take its name: The people hereof, (as some in Norway) use dried fish
instead of bread, the best commodity is their fish, which they exchange with
foreign Merchants for other things, of which they have more use, and less
abundance. The Island Ling is famous all over Europe. The chief Towns are
Hallen, and Seh^fholten, honored with the seats of two Bishops In this Island
is the hill Hecklefo^t, vomiting flames of fire like Aetna of Sicily: of which
also the blind Papists have the same superstitious opinion; namely, that under
them is Purgatory. This Island is subject unto the Kings of Swethland, and is
generally conceived to be that Island, called of old, Thyle, of which frequent
mention is made in Poets, as Tibi serv^at ultima Thyle, in Virgil: nec sit
terris ultima Thyle, in Seneca. The reason which persuades them to this
conjecture, is, because it is indeed the remotest part of the old world: but
greater reasons are against it. For when Solinus says, Multa sunt circa
Britanniam insulae, e quibus Thyle ultima; I hope Thyle must be one of the
British Isles: and when Tacitus says, Insulas quas Orchadas vocant, invenit
domuitque dispecta est and Thyle; I am certa^n Island is so fair from being
kenned from any part of the Orcades, that it is at least eight degrees distant.
But to what Island the name of Thyle more properly belongs, we have already
told you.

3 FREEZLAND, called in Latin Frizlandia, to distinguish it from Frizia or
Freizland in Belgia; is under the North-frigid Zone, but not so far within
the Artick Circle as Island: the longest day being here almost 20 hours. The
only riches of it is their Fish, for which commodity it is never without the
ships of Flemmings, Scots, Danes, Hautsmen, and English, which especially so
frequent it, that it has by some bin called the Western England It is almost
as big as Ireland, and is subject to the King of Denmark.

4 NOVA ZEMIA lies on the North of Muscovie and Lapland, and is famous for
nothing but the Pigmies which are here supposed to inhabit.

5 Sir HVGH WILLOVGHBIES LAND, so called, because he first discovered it, Ao
1553: and because he was thereabouts frozen to death: For being sent by the
London Merchants in the tim^ of Edward the 6, to search a new way toward
Muscovia, Cathaia, and China; the weather proved so extreme, and the frost so
vehement, that his ship was set fast in the ice, and his people were frozen to
death; the ship being found the next year, with a perfect descrip^ion of their
voyage and fortunes. This enterprise, notwithstanding so disastrous a
beginning, was prosecuted by the English, under the leadi^g of Ienkinson,
Borough, and others; who have discovered half the way to China, even as far
as the river Obi, and the Eastern confines of Muscovia: but the rest is left
uncertain to further voyages in future ages.

Thus much of the Northern Islands.

THE END OF EVROPE.
OF ASIA:
ASIA is separate from Europe by the Aegean, Propontis, Euxine Sea; by Palus
Moeotis, Tanais, Duina, and a line drawn from the one to the other: and from
Africa by the Red Sea, and the Egyptian Istmus.

This most famous Country borrows her denomination from ASIA, daughter to
Oceanus and Thetis, wife to Iapetus, and mother to Prometheus. It stretches in
length 5200, and in breadth 4560 miles.

This Country has worn the Garland of supereminency: 1 Because here man was
created and put to till the land. 2ly Here our Savior Christ was borne,
wrought his divine miracles, and suffered for our salvation on the Cross. 3ly
Here were done the actions memorized by the holy penmen of the Old and New
Testament. 4ly Here were the first Monarchies of the Babylonians, Assyrians,
Persians, and Medes. 5ly This is the common mother of us all, from whence, as
from the Trojan horse, innumerable troops of men issued to people the other
parts of the uninhabited world.

Through this Country runs the hill Taurus, which reckoning his several
bendings in and out, is 6250 miles long, and 375 broad. For it begins about
Caria and Lycia in Anatolia, and is in diverse places called by diverse names,
as Caueasus, Parapomisus, Niphates, Sarpedon, Periadres, Gordiaei, Anti Taurus,
etc. Through this hill are three principal passages, viz: 1 Out of the rest of
Anatolia into C^licia, called Pylae Ciliciae, of which more anon^ 2ly Out of
Scythia into Armenia, of which more at large when we come into that Country.
and 3ly One of Scythia into Media, which are called by reason of their
neighborhood to the Caspian Sea, Caspiae portae. These are the most famous,
containing eight miles in length, but for breadth scarce wide enough for a Cart
to pass, and are supposed to have been the work of men rather then nature.
The 2d mountain of note is Imaus, which beginning in the shore of the North
Ocean, and running directly toward the South, keeps almost the same
Meridian, viz: the longitude of 130 degrees, and crosses the hill Taurus, even
in a manner at right angles. And as Taurus divides the North of Asia from the
South; so does this the East from the West: and makes that ancient division of
Scythia, into Scythia intra Imaum, and Scythia extra Imaum.

The principal regions of Asia are 1 Anatolia. 2 Syria. 3 Palestina. 4
Armenia. 5 Arabia. 6 Media. 7 Assyria. 8 Mesopotamia. 9 Persia. 10 Chaldaea. 11
Parthia. 12 Hircania. 13 Tartaria. 14 China. 15 India. 16 The Islands which lay
dispersed either in the Indian Seas, or in the Mediterranean.

ANATOLIA.
Maginus
ANATOLIA is limited on the East with the river Euphrates; on the West with
Thracius Bosphorus, Propontis, Hellespont, and the Aegean; on the North with
Pontus Euxinus; on the South with the Rhodian and Lycian Seas.

It was formerly called Asia Minor, to distinguish it from Asia the greater:
but now Anatolia (and corruptly Natolia) from its more Eastern situation in
respect of Greece (...). There is another Asia contained also in this Natolia
called Asia Propria, and Asia (...), which comprehends Caria, Ionia, Lydia,
Aeolis, and both the Phrygia's. This is that Asia which is meant Act. 19.10.
where it is said that all Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus: and Act.
19.27. where it is said that all Asia and the world worsh^pped the Temple of
Diana: neither of which places can be understood either of Asia the greater, or
of Anatolia, but of this only.

This Country is situate under the fifth and sixth Climats of the Northern
temperate Zone, the longest day being 15 hours and a half. It is adorned with
many commodious Havens, and was once of great fertility, but is now laid wast
and desolate, greivously lamenting the ruins of 4000 Cities and Towns.

The people were once valiant and industrious, now so much addicted to a
luxurious effeminacy, that the Turks (unless constrained by urgent
necessities) never inrole their children in the number of Ianizaries. Here once
flourished the faith of Christ, sealed by the blood of many of this nation. Here
were the seven Churches to which John dedicated his Revelation; 1 Ephesus, 2
Smyrna, 3 Thiatyra, 4 Laodicea, 5 Pergamus, 6 Philadelphia, 7 Sardis: All whose
Candlesticks have been long since removed, and now Mahumetisme has so far
encroached on them, that few Christians remain, and they which are, are of the
Church and communion of Greece.

This Region comprehends the several Provinces of Cilicia. 2 Pamphylia. 3
Lycia. 4 Caria. 5 Ionia. 6 Lydia. 7 Aeolis. 8 ^hrygia minor. 9 Mayor. 10
Bythmia. 11 Pontus. 12 Paphlagonia. 13 Galatia. 14 Cappadocia. 15 Lycaonia. 16
Pisidia. and 17 Armenia minor.

1. CILICIA.
On the South-east of Anatolia is CILICIA, watered with the river Cidnus, whose
water proved very infectious to Alexander the Great; and deadly to the Emperor
Frederick the first, who was here drowned as he was bathing himself.

In this Province is the hill Anti-Taurus, in the straights of which mountain
called Pylae Ciliciae, was fought that memorable battle, betwixt Seuerus and
Pescenninus Niger, for the Monarchy of the world. Wherein the Nigrians being
possessed of the entrance into the straights, manfully withstood the Seuerians,
till at last a sudden tempest of rain and thunder, continually darting in
their faces, the very heavens seeming to be against them; they were compelled
to leave the passage, and the victory to the enemy, having lost 20000 of their
fellow Soldiers. Nigh unto this place Alexander with 30000 men, overcame the
Army of Darius king of Persia, consisting of 600000 Soldiers, whereof 110000
lost their lives. The chief Cities are Nicopolis, built by Alexander, in
memory of his victory. 2 Pompeiopolis, built by Pompey the great, after his
victory over the Pirates: who not only Lorded it over the Sea, but wasted and
spoiled the villages of Italy it self. Pompey being victor and having
inflicted exemplary punishment on the ringleaders, with the rest peopled this
new Town and the Country adjoining; allowing them competent possessions, least
want and necessity should again enforce them to the like courses. An action
truly commendable, and worthy so great a Captain, rather to take occasion of
offending from the people, then after offense done to punish them. Hythlodaeus
in the Vtopia, somewhat bitterly, though perhaps not unjustly, inueigheth
against our laws, for ordaining death to be the guerdon for theft; Cum multo
potius providendum fuerit, vti aliquis esset prouentus vitae; ne cuipiam ^it
tam dira furandi primum, deinde pereundi necessitas. 3 Alexandria, built also
by Alexander, and to distinguish it from Alexandria of Egypt, called
Alexandretta, and now Scanderone, a famous haven. And 4 Tarsus, the birthplace
of S. Paul, to which place Jonah intended to fly when he was sent to Nineveh.
The inhabitants are given most to the pasturing of Goats of whose Fleeces they
make their Chamblets: and to the keeping of horses, of which here is such
store, that the Turkish Emperor culleth every year from hence 600 horses of
service.

2 PAMPHILIA.
On the West side of Cilicia lies PAMPHILIA, watered with the rivers Melas and
Oestros; whose chief Towns are Seleucia built by S^leucus, one of Alexanders
successors. 2 Perga where Diana was worshipped, and 3 Faselis. The people of
this Country, and of Cilicia, were called Soli, from whose barbarous kind of
pronunciation came the word Soloecismus. Amongst these Aratus was borne. In
this Country is the river Eurymedon, in and nigh unto which Simon the son of
Miltiades, captain general of the Athenians, overthrew the sea and land
forces of the Persians in one day. He took and sunk no fewer then 40 ships,
and 300 Galleys in the sea-sight: which ended, he stowed the Persian ships with
his best men attired in the h^bit, and wauing the colors of the Persians. Upon
their approach the Camp was opened, and all prepared to entertain their
victorious Countrymen. But the Greeks once in, suddenly put them to the sword,
and took 20000 of them prisoners.

3 LYCIA.
On the West side of Pamphilia is LYCIA, watered with the river Xanthus, of
which the people hereabout were called Xanthi: who being too weak for Harpagus
the Persian Kings Leiftenant, first burnt their wives, children, servants, and
riches, and then made a sallie against Harpagus, who put them all to the Sword.
They were called Lycij afterward from Lycus, son of Pandion. Before the Roman
conquest this Province was governed by a common Council of 23 men, culled out
of their 23 Cities, of which the chief now is Patras. 2 Isaurus, which being
brought under by Servilius, gave him the surname of Isauricus. 3 Phaselis, a
Town as much enriched, and haunted by Pirates, as Algeirs is now adays. This
Town was taken by the same Servilius, at what time Pompey scoured the Seas;
whose victory over that rabble of pirates we cannot sufficiently admire, if
either we consider the speediness, as gotten in little more the^ a month; the
easiness, the Romans not loosing one vessel; or the event, the Pirates after
that time never infesting and troubling the Seas.

4 CARIA.
On the West side of Lycia is CARIA, so called from its king Cara, who first
invented the science of Divination by the flying of Birds called Augurie. The
people hereof were in former times accounted very valiant, and as says Mela,
Eo armorum pugnaequeamans, vt alien^ etiam bella mercede ageret: as the
Switzers in these our times do. In this Country is the river Salmacis, said to
inseeble all such as either drank of it, or bathed in it. From whence the
Poets took their fiction of Salmacis and Hermapoeditus described by Ovid* and
from whence came the phrase Sal^^acida spolia sine sanguine and sudore,
mentioned by Tully in his book de Officijs, and there used for effeminate or
veneriall conquests. The chief Cities are Mindum, which being but a small
Town had great Gates, so that Diogenes the Cynicke cried out; Ye Citizens of
Mindum take heed your City run not out of your Gates. 2 Halicarnassus, where
Dionysius Halicarnasseus was borne, who writ the history of Rome for the first
300 years. The whole Province is in some approved Authors named Halicarnassus:
and Artemisia, who aided Xerxes against the Grecians, is called the Queen of
Halicarnassus. This is she, who in the honor of her husband Mausolus, built
that curious sepulcher, accounted one of the worlds wonders; it being 25 Cubits
high, and supported with 36 curious pillars: of which Martial.

Aere nam vacuo pendentia Mausolaea,
Laudibus immodicis Cares ad astra ferunt.
The Mausolaea hanging in the sky,
The men of Caria's praises deifie.
3 Magnesia, which together with Lamsacus and Mius was assigned by Xerxes to
Themistocles, when being banished his Country, he fled to his greatest enemy
for entertainment; and there met with more safety then Athens would, and more
honors then it could afford him. So that he might well say periissem nisi
periissem. The King also was in a manner ouer-ioyed with his presence, as
having (as he thought) on his side the man which had most hindered his conquest
of all Gre^ce; insomuch that many nights he was heard, even in the midst of his
sleep, to clappe his hands, and cry out, habe^ Themistoclen Atheniensem.

These 4 Countries are now called Caramania, from Caramon a Captain of
Aladine, the last Turkish King of the Zelzuccian family: who after the decease
of his Sovereign, erected here a kingdom; which remained till Bajazet the
second of the Oguzian or Ottomanicall family subverted it. It is now a
Zanziack-ship, and yields to the great Turk 80000 Ducats yearly.

5 IONIA.
On the North side of Carta is IONIA, whose chief Cities are 1 Miletum, the
birthplace of Thales and Anaximeres. 2 Smyrna. 3 Colophon, both which strove
for the birth of Homer, as also did five others. Septem vrbes certant de stirpe
insignis Homeri;
Seven Cities vndernamed did strive
Which had seen Homer first alive.
1 Smyrna. 2 Rhod^s. 3 Colophon. 4 Salamis. 5 Chios. 6 Argos. Athe^ae

Whether Homer purposely concealed his Country, that men of all places might
challenge him for theirs, I cannot say: only this I am sure of, that Paterculus
spoke it in the commendation of Hesiodus, the next Greek Poet in order after
him; that he had made known his birthplace: qui vit^vit ne in id, quod
Homerus, incideret; patriam and parents testatus est. The 4th City of note is
Ephesus, whereof Timothy was Bishop. To the people of this City did St Paul
direct one of his Epistles. Finally this Town is famous for the burial of S.
John the Evangelist, who went alive into the grave, and by some learned men is
thought not yet to be dead, but only sleeping. 2ly, For the temple of Diana;
which for the spaciousness, furniture and workmanship, was accounted one of
the worlds wonders. It was 200 years in building, contrived by Ctesiphon:
being 425 foot long and 220 broad: sustained with 127 pillars of marble 70 foot
high; whereof 27 were most curiously graven, and all the rest of marble
pollisht. It was fired 7 times, and lastly by Erostratus (that night in which
Alexander was borne) to get himself a name, 5 Priene the birthplace of Bias.
In this Country is the hill L^tmus the dwelling place of Endimion, who being
much addicted to the study of Astronomy, and having found out the course and
changes of the Moon; is by the Poets fained to have been the Moons darling,
or sweet heart. Others add that Jupiter hid him in a cave under this hill,
casting him into a dead sleep (whether notwithstanding the Moon descended to
kiss him) whence arose the old proverb Endimionis somnium dormit.

The Ionians immediately after the taking of Croesus were subdued by Harpagus
Leiftenant to Cyrus the first Persian Monarch. Such of them as p^efer'd a free
exile before a domestical prison, planted Colonies in the westward parts, and
among others that of Marseiles (unless as others conjecture it were a
plantation of the Phoenicians) others living in an unwilling subjection in the
time of Darius Histaspis again revolted. In which rebellion the Athenians
assisted the Ionians, which was the principal motive of the invasion of
Greece, by the same Darius.

On the South of this Province is the little country Doris: the people whereof
together with the Ionians and Aeolians, were anciently only accounted Greeks;
and the other nations of Asia, Barbarians; the chief Cities are 1 Cnidis and
Ceraunus.

This Country is now called Sarachan, from Sarachan; who after the death of
Aladine erected here a petty kingdom; subdued by the Ottoman Kings.

6 LYDIA.
On the Northeast of Ionia, is LYDIA; watered with the rivers Caistrus, famous
for his abundance of Swannes; and Maeander which has in it 600 windings in and
out.

Quique recurvatis ludit Maeander in vndis.
Maeander plays his watery prankes
Within his crooked winding banks.
The people of this Country are said to have been the first coyners of money,
the first Hucksters and Pedlers; and the first inventers of dice, ball, chesse,
and the like games, necessity and hunger thereunto enforcing them, according to
that of Persius, Artis magister ingenijque largitor venture. For being sorely
vexed with famine iu the time of Atis one of the progenitors of Omphale, they
devised these games, and every second day by playing at the^ beguiled their
hungry bellies. Thus for 22 years they continued playing and eating by turns;
but then seeing that themselves were more fruitful in getting and bearing
children, then the soil in bringing forth sustenance to maintain them: they
sent a Colonie into Italy under the conduct of Tyrrhenus the son of Atis, who
planted in the Country, called at first Tyrrhenia, and afterward Tuscanie.

This Country was also called Moeonia, and was thought to have been the
birthplace of Homer, who is therefore called Moeonius vates, also Moeonides;
and carmen Moeonium is used for Homers poetical abilities, as carmine Moeonio
consurgere in Ovid. Bacchus is also diverse times called Maeonius, but for a
different reason; because indeed here are in all this Country no trees but of
Grapes.

The chief Cities are Sardis the royal seat of King Croesus. 2 Pergamus
where King Attalus reigned, who made the Romans his heir: where parchment was
invented, and therefore called Pergamenum: where Galen was borne, and lived
healthfully 140 years: whereof he assigns these reasons: He never eat or
drunk his fill; 2ly he never eat any raw food; 3 he ever carried some sweet
perfume with him. 3 Laodicea. 4 Theatyra. 5 Philadelphia.

Of these Sardis was the strongest; and when it was once taken by the Grecians,
Xerxes gave commandment, that every day at dinner one speaking alowd, should
say, that the Grecians had taken Sardis. Such an order the French had in their
Parliaments during the time that Calice was English; and it were not amiss if
we used the same custom, till it be again recovered.

Lydia took its name, either from Lydus a Noblema^ of great power: or from Lud
the fourth son of Sem. It became to be a Kingdom somewhat before the
building of Rome, under one Ardisius, lineally descended from Hercules, and
Omphale; who was once Queen of Lydia: but after the kingdom decayed, and now
was restored.

The Kings of Lydia.
3190 1 Ardisius 36. 3226 2 Aliactes 14. 3240 3 Melos, who overcame the people
of Sardis. 3252 4 Candaules, who showing his wife naked to Giges, was by him
slain, who marrying his wife succeeded him in the kingdom. 17. The whole
story is this. Candaules had to his wife a woman of unparalleled beauty; and
supposing the greatness of his happiness, not to consist so much in his own
fruition, as the notice which others might take of it; intended to show her in
natures bravery to Giges the master of his herds. Giges at first dissuaded him
from an attempt so foolish; but seeing no persuasion could prevail, he
condescended. When he had seen the naked Queen, and was ready to depart,
Candaules cried to him Esto fidelis, Giges: which words the Queen marking, and
seeing the back of Giges as he left the chamber, the next morning sent for
him. When holding a poniard in her hand, she gave him this choice, either
presently to be slain, or else to kill the King and take her to wife, with the
kingdom for her dowre. He made choice of this latter evil, and killed the
foolish Candaules. 3269 5 Giges subdued all Ionia. 36. 3305 6 Ardis 37. 3342 7
Sadautes. 15. 3357 8 Haliactes II. 49. 3406 9 Croesus the last King of Lydia,
subdued Doris and Aeolis; after which victories he was overcome by Cyrus King
of Persia, in which battle a son of Croesus who had been dumb from his
cradle, seeing a Soldier ready to kill his father, suddenly broke out into
these words, Rex est, cauene o^cidas. After this overthrow and the captivity
of Croes^s, one of the richest Kings that ever was of old; Lydia was made a
Persian province, Anno M. 3420.
The Lydians after this rebelled; but being again subdued, Cyrus berea^ed them
of all their Horses of service, dispoyled them of all their armor; and trained
them up in all manner of loose and effeminate living: weakening by this means a
powerful nation, which before that time had not only maintained its own
liberty, but awed all the Provinces adjoining.

7 AEOLIS and MYSIA.
On the North of Lydia is AEOLIS, watered with the River Caycus. The chief
Towns are M^rina. 2 Hidra. 3 Erithro. Nigh to this Province are both the
MYSIAS, the people whereof were of so base a condition, that it grew to an
adage to call a fellow of no worth Mysorum postremus. The chief City was
Lampsacus, where the beastly God Priapus, was worshipped in as beastly a manner
and form. It is recorded that when Alexander was in Asia, he intended utterly
to raze this City; and seeing Anaximenes come to him as an Ambassador from
the Town, bad him be silent, and swore unto him he would deny whatsoever he
requested: whereupon Anaximenes entreated him to destroy the City, which for
his oaths sake he could not do; and so Lampsacus at that time escaped. 2
Cyzicus.

8 PHRYGIA MINOR.
On the North-East of Aeolis is PHRYGIA MINOR, ^atred with Divine Scamander
purpled yet with blood
Of Greeks and Trojans which therein did die;
Pactolus glystring with his golden flood;
And Hermus sweet etc. as Spencer in his F. Q.
It was called Phrygia from Phryxus, son to Athamas king of The^es, who
flying from the treacherous snares of his mother Ino, here seated himself.
Here are the mountains Tmolus and Ida* on which last Paris (being by his
Father Priamus exposed to wild beasts fury) judged the controversy of the
golden ball unto Venus; respecting neither the powerful riches of Juno, nor
the divine wisdom of Pallas, but transported with a sensual delight, fatal
in the end to the whole Country. The chief Cities are Adramittiu^ mentioned
in the 17 of the Acts. 2 Traeianopolis, whose name proclaims his founder. 3
Sigeum the ^aven Town to Troy. And 4ly Ilium, or Troy, a famous Town, from
the people whereof, all nations desire to fetch their original. The beauty of
it may be (as some write) yet seen in the ruins, which with a kind of
Majesty entertain the beholders, the walls of large circuit, consisting of a
black hard stone cut foure-square: some remnants of the Turrets which stood on
the walls, and the fragments of great marble tombs and monuments of curious
workmanship. But certainly these are not the ruins of that Ilium, which was
destroyed by the Grecians, but another of the same name, built some four miles
from the situation of the old, by Lysimachus one of Alexanders Captains, who
peopled it from the neighboring Cities. Now concerning old Ilium and the fall
thereof, take with you this epitomated story. The Kings and history of Troy.
2486 1 Dardanus son to Corinthus, King of Corinth having killed his brother
Iasius, fled into this Country, where he built this City calling it
Dardania 31. 2518 2 E^^chtonius. 15. 2593 3 Tros, from whom the Country was
named Troas, the City Troy; a King which by supporting the unnatural malice
of Saturn against his worthy son Jupiter, lost his own son Ga^imedes: who
being taken by Jupiter whose ensign was the Eagle, is said to have been
snatched up to heaven by an Eagle. 60. 2653 4 Ilus who built the regal palace
called Ilium. 54. 2707 5 Laomedon, who new built Troy, which afterward
Hercules and the Grecians, justly conceauing displeasure against the
treacherous King, twice took and defaced: Laomedon himself being slai^e the
latter time. 36. 2743 6 Priamus who reedified Troy; but giving leave to his
son Paris, to ravish Helena wife to Menelaus King of Sparta, forced the
Greeks to renew their ancient quarrel: who after a ten years siege forced the
Town, having lost their own men 860000, and slain 666000 of them; Ao M.
1783: so as that of Ovid may be truly inferred.
Iam seges est vbi Troia suit, resecandaque falce
Luxuriat Phrygio sanguine pinguis humus.
Corn fit for Sithes now grows where Troy once stood,
And the soyle's fatted with the Phrygian blood.
Concerning the taking of this Town, two things are considerable. First
whether the Grecians in these ten years lay continually before it; and it
seems they did not: but that rather they did beat up and down, wasting the
Country, and robbing the Seas for the first nine years, and in the tenth only
laid a formal siege. This is the more probable, because that in the tenth
year of the war, Priam is recorded by Homer in the 3d of his Iliads to have
sat on a high Tower, and learned of Helen the names and qualities of the
Greek commanders: which he could not be thought ignorant of, if they had for
so long together layne in eye-reach. Secondly by what means the Town was
taken; and here we find a difference: for some historians tell us that Aeneas
and Antenor betrayed it to the enemy: but this Virgil could not brook, as
prejudicial to his Aeneas, whom he intended to make the pattern of a complete
Prince. He t^erefore tells us of a wooden horse wherein diverse of the Greek
Princes lay hidden; which by Sinon, one of the Grecians, was brought to Troy
gates; and that the people desirous of that monument of the enemies flight,
made a breach in their walls* the gate not being high enough to receive it. That
this fiction of Virgil might be grounded on history, it is thought by some that
over the Scaean gate where the Greeks entered, was the picture of a large and
stately horse: and by others, that the walls were battered by a wooden engine
called a horse, as the Romans in after times used a like engine called a R^mme.
Neither of these is much improbable, but with me they persuade not the
integrity of Antenor and Aeneas.

This Province together with Aeolis and part of Lydia, are now called Carausia,
from Carasus a Turkish Captain; who after the death of Aladine the last Turkish
Sultan of the Zelzuccian Tribe, here erected a petty kingdom, long since
swallowed by the Ottoman Emperors.

9 PHRYGIA MAYOR.
On the East side of Phrygia minor is PHRYGIA MAYOR, watered with the rivers
Sangarius and Marsyas; this latter being so called from one Marsyas, who
striving with Apollo for pre-eminence in Music, was by him stead: which fact
(say the Poets) was so lamented, that from the tears of the mourners grew this
river. The chief Towns are 1 Gordion the seat of Gordius, who from a plowman
being raised and chosen King of this kingdom, placed the furniture of his
waine and Oxen in the Temple of Apollo; tie^ in such a knot, that the Monarchy
of the world was promised to him that could untie it: which when Alexander had
long tried and could not do, he cut it with his sword. 2 Midaium the seat of
Midas son to this Gordius, who being not a little covetous, entreated of
Bacchus that whateuer he touched should be gold; which petition granted, he was
almost starued, his very victuals turning into gold, till he had repealed his
wish: and afterward for preferring Pans Pipe before Ap^lloes Harp, his head
was adorned with a comely pair of Asses ears. 3 Apamia. 4 Colosse where dwelt
the Colossians, to whom S. Paul writ one of his Epistles. 5 Pesinus where the
Goddess Cibele being worshipped, was called D^a Pesinuntia. The Romans were
once told by an oracle, that they should be Lords of the world if they could
get this Goddess. Hereupon they send to the Phrygians to demand it. The
Phrygians willing to please a potent neighbor, especially the Romans being
their Countrymen, as descended from Aeneas and his Trojans: granted their
request, and the Goddess is shipped for Rome. But behold the unluckiness of
fortune. The ship, Goddess, and all made a stand in Tiber, neither could it be
again moved forward by force or slight. It happened that one Claudia a Vestall
virgin being suspected of incontinency, tied her girdle unto it; praying the
Goddess, that if she were causelessly suspected, she would suffer the ship to
go forward, which was no sooner said then granted; Claudia by her girdle
drawing the ship up the stream to Rome, where I leave the people wondering at
the miracle.

The Phrygians were by Psamniticus King of Egypt, accounted the ancientest
people of the world, and that forsooth on this wise experiment. Psamniticus
desirous to know to whom the greatest antiquity of right belonged, caused two
children to be shut up in a ^old, where they were suckled by Goats, al humane
company being on a great penalty prohibited to visit them. All the language
which the children had learned of the Goats their nurses was Bec; which with
the Phrygians signifying bread, and in no other tongue, as it seems, bearing
any signification at al, gave the verdict on their side: but as it appears the
other nations of the world not yielding to this sentence, by a writ of Ad
melius inquirendum, impannelled a new Jury, wherein it was pronounced that
Scytharum gens semper erat antiquissima. In this kingdom reigned Niobe, who
preferring her self before Latona, had all her children slain before her
face, and she her self was turned to a stone. Here also reigned Tantalus, who
being rich and wanting wit to use his prosperity, is fained to stand in hell up
to the chinne in water, and under a tree whose apples touch his lips; yet both
the one and the other fly from him, of which thus Ovid, -- Tibi Tantale nullae
Deprenduntur aquae, quaeque imminet effugit arbor.
Thou can not, Tantalus, the waters taste;
The tree hanged over thee does fly as fast.
This Country together with the other part of Lydia, was once the Territory of
the Aidinian Kings, so called from Aidin, another Turkish Captain; who after
the death of Aladine possessed these parts with the title of King; long since
overthrown by the Ottoman Family.

10 BYTHINIA.
On the North side of the Phrygias is seated Bythinia, watered with the rivers
Sangarius. 2 Ascanius. 3 Calpas. 4 Psillis. and ^ Granuicu^, nigh unto which
Alexander obtained the first victory against the Persians, of whom he slew
20000. Nigh unto this is mount Stella, where Pompey overthrew Mithridates; and
Tamberlaine with 800000 Tartarians, encountered with Baiaz^t, whose Army
consisted of 500000 men: of which 200000 lost their lives that day; and Bajazet
being taken, was pend and carried about in an iron Cage, against whose bars
he beat out his brains. The ch^efe Towns are Nicomedia, whose name declares
its founder. 2 Phasso where Aesculapius was borne. 3 Heraclia. 4 Nice where the
first general Council was held Anno 314, to which there assembled 318 Bishops
to beat down the Arian heresy. Here was also called another Council by the
Empress Irene, but for a worse end* for in this the lawfulness of making and
worshipping Images was established, and that verily by many substantial
arguments. John one of the Legates of the Eastern Churches, proved the making
of Images lawful, because God said, Let us make man after our own image: A
sound argument to overthrow one of Gods Commandments, and yet it was the^e
decreed, that they should be reverenced and adored in as ample and pious
manner, as the blessed and glorious Trinity. This City was the imperial seat
of the Nicean Kings: the first of which was Theodorus Lascaris, who fled hither
from the Latins, who had newly taken Constantinople; and began this kingdom
containing Bythinia, both Phrygia's, Lydia, and Ionia. The fourth and last King
was also a Theodorus, who lost it to Michael Palaeologus. 5 Calcedon, where the
fourth general Council was assembled by the command of the Emperor Martianus,
to repel the heresy of Nestorius; in this Council were 530 Bishops. 6 Prusa
or Brusa, built by Prusias King of Bythinia; which betrayed Annibal, who fled
to him for succor. Fourth Libissa, where Annibal lies buried. This Prusa was
a long time the seat of the Ottoman Kings, till Mahomet the first began to
keep his residence at Adrianople.

II PONTVS.
On the North-East of Bythinia is PONTVS, watered with the rivers Parthus and
Hippias. The chief Towns are 1 Tomos to which Ovid was banished. Cum maris
Euxini positos ad lae^ae Tomitas,
Quaerere me laesi principis ira iubet.
My wronged Princes wrath commands me seek
Tomos upon Euxinus left hand creek.
For what cause this most excellent Poet was banished, is not yet agreed on.
Some say it was for the unlawful pleasures, which he enjoyed with Iulia,
Augustus daughter; whom, in his Amorum, he celebrateth under the borrowed name
of Corinna. Others imagine, that he had seen Augustus himself unnaturally
using the company of the same Iulia, his daughter; for which the offended
Prince banished him: to which, it is thought he alluded, in his book de
Tristibus, where he says, Cur aliquid vidi, cur nexia lumina feci? etc. But
certain it is, that whatsoever was the true reason of his exile, the pretended
cause was, the lascivious and inflammatory books which he ha^ written, de art
amandi; and this he in diverse places of his works acknowledges. 2.
Claudiopolis. 3 Flau^opolis. and Pythius where Chrysostom lived in exile. In
this Country lived King Mithridat^s, who being once a friend and confederate
with the Romans, to^k their part against Aristonicus; who would not consent to
the admission of the Romans into Pergamus, according to the will of Attalus.
Afterward conceauing an ambitious hope to obtain the Monarchy of Asia, in one
night he plotted and effected the death of all the Roman Soldiers dispersed in
Anatolia, being in number 150000* in like manner, as in after times the
English, taught perhaps by this example, murdered all the Danes then resident in
England; and the Sicilians massacred all the French inhabiting Sicilia, as we
have formerly declared. He dispossessed Nicodemes son to Prusias King of
Bythinia, Ariobarzanes King of Cappadocia, and Philemen King of Paphlagonia, of
their estates; because they persisted faithful to his enemies of Rome* he
excited the Grecians to rebel, and allured all the Isles, except Rhodes, from
their obedience to the Romans: and finally having disturbed their victories,
and much shaken their estate, for the space of 40 years; he was with much
ado vanquished by the valor and felicity of L. Sylla, Lucullus, and Pompey
the great, three of the greatest Soldiers that ever the Roman Empire knew:
yet did not the Roman puissance so much pluck down his proud heart, as the
rebellion of his son Pharnaces against him; which he no sooner heard, but he
would have poisoned himself: but having formerly so used his body to a kind
of poison allaid (which from his inuenting of it we now call Mithridate) that
the venom could not work upon him, he slew himself. He is said to have been
an excellent Scholar, and to have spoken perfectly the languages of 22
nations. After his death the Romans easily recovered their own, and made that
kingdom a Province of their Empire.

12 PAPHLAGONIA.
On the East side of Pontus is PAPHLAGONIA (so called from Paphlago, son to
Phineus) watered with the river Parthenius. The chief city is Pompe^opolis, Mela.
built by Pompey the great. 2 Sinopo famous for its plenty of brass, Lead, and
other minerals. 3 Tios of old a Colony of the Milesians; 4 Citoros built and
named by Citorus the son of that Phryxus, of whom Phrygia took denomination. 4
Amysus a sea-towne once of great fame, now called Simiso. Mithridates, of whom
we but now spoke, was this Countryman by birth, who for that cause so loved it,
that he here kept his residence, Maginus.
and made the city of Sinope his regal seat. This little Country was
heretofore the seat of four d^fferent Nations, viz: 1 the Tibareni, of whom it
is said, that they never waged war on any enemy, but they faithfully
certified them beforehand, of the time and place of their fight. 2ly the
Heptacometae. 3ly the Mossynoeci, both which were a people so beastly and
shameless, that they used to perform the work of generation in public, not
knowing that multa sunt honesta factu, quae sunt turpia visu: and 4ly the
Heneti, to whom the Venetians, as we have already said, do owe their original.

13 GALLATIA.
On the Southside of Paphlagonia is GALLATIA, so called of the Gauls, who here
planted themselves under the leading of Brennus: to the people of this Province
did S. Paul dedicate one of his Epistles. The chief cities hereof are 1 Gutia,
or Iuliopolis. 2 Ancyra (now Angouri) famous at this present for the making of
chamlets, and in former times for a Synod here holden, called Synodus
A^cyricana. 3 Pisius a town of great traffic. And 4 Tavium, where there was a
brazen Statua of Jupiter, whose Temple was a privileged Sanctuary.

The soil is very fruitful, but above all yields the stones called
Amithists, which are said to preserve the man that wears them from
drunkenness; and take name from a privativum, and (...), ebrius, which comes
from (...), vinum.

The principal rivers are 1 Tion and Halis.

The people hereof were Gauls only in name, retaining little in them of their
Ancestors valor. For as the plants and trees loose much of their virtue,
being transplanted into another soil; so these men lost their native courage,
strength, and hardiness, being weakened by the Asian pleasures and delicacies.
So as Tully says, for a man to be good in other places, is no masterie; but in
Asia to lead a temperate life, is indeed praiseworthy. So might one have said
to the Gauls: To be courageous and patient of travel among the mountains,
was no whit admired; but to have continued so amidst the delights of Asia, had
bin indeed meritorious. But these men were so far from assailing the Romans
in the Ca^itol, that they lost their own Country to Manlius a Roman General.
During which war* I find no memorable act, but that of the Kings wife
Chiomara; who being by a Centurion ravished, in revenge cut off his head, and
presented it to her husband. Deiotarus, whose cause Tully pleaded, was king of
this Province.

14 CAPPADOCIA.
On the East side of Gallatia, is Leucosyria, or CAPPADOCIA, the people whereof
were formerly accounted to be of a very poisonous nature, insomuch that it is
recorded, that if a snake did bite a Cappadocian, Turk. hist.
the man's blood was poison to the snake. and killed him. The chief cities are 1
Erzyrum, situate on the very confines of the greater Armenia; for which cause
it is the Rendevous or place of meeting for all the Turkish soldiers, when
there is any e^pedition in hand against the Persian; and where, after the war
or summer ^nded, they are all again dismissed. 2 Amasia, whether the Turkish
Emperous continually use to send their eldest sons immediately after their
circumcision, whence they never return again, till the deaths of their
fathers. 3 Mazaca, called by T^berius, Neo-Caesarea, where S. Basil li^ed, who
was the first Author of Monastical lives. 4 Sebas^ia in which when Tamberlain
had taken it, he buried 12000 men, women, and children in some few pits alive
together. 5 Nazianzum, whereof Gregory Nazianzenus was Bishop. 6 Nyssa, where
lived another Gregory called Nyssenus, brother to S. Basil, and 7 Trapesus, or
Trabezond, the Imperial seat of the Comneni. Im^ediatly after the Latins were
possessed of the Constantinopolitan Empire, Alexius Comnenus, one of the blood
regal, withdrew himself to this town, and raised here a new Empire;
containing Pontus, Gallatia, and Cappadocia, about the year 1205. This Empire
flourished in all prosperity till the year 1461, when Mahomet the great took
it from David the last Emperor, whose name and progeny he quite extinguished.

The chief rivers of this Country are 1 Iris, and 2 Thermodon. About the banks
of this river Thermodon, dwelt the Amazons, so called either quasi (...),
because they used to cut off their right papps, that they might not be an
impediment to their shooting: or from (...) and (...) sine pane, because they
used not to eat bread; or from (...), because they live together. They were
originally of Scythia, Pezel. in Sleid.
and accompanied their husbands to these parts, about the time of the Scythians
first irruptions into Asia, in the time of Sesostris king of Egypt. The leaders
of this people into Cappadocia, were Plinos and Scolpythus, two young men of a
great house, whom a contrary faction had banished. They held a great hand over
the Themiscyrij, who inhabited this region, and the Nations round about them:
At last they were by treachery all murdered. But their wives now doubly vexed
both with exile and widowhood, and extremity of grief and fear, producing its
usual effect, desperatnes; they set upon the Conquerours under the conduct of
Lampedo and Marpesia, and not only overthrow them, but also infinitely enlarge
their Dominions: such as were subjected unto them they called (...).

The Amazonian Queens.
1 Lampedo first Queens of the Amazons in Cappadocia. 1 Marpesia first Queens
of the Amazons in Cappadocia. 2 Ortera. 3 Antiopa, whose sisters Hippolite and
Menalippe, challenged Hercules and Theseus to single combat: and were at last
hardly vanquished, to their eternal credits. 4 Penthisilea, who came with a
troop of brave Viragoes, to the aid of Priam King of Troy; she invented the
battle axe, and was at last slain by Pyrrhus, son to Achilles. Long after her
death reigned Thalestris, who came to Alexander being in Hircania, and plainly
told him she came to lie with him; which done, she returned: and at last by
little and little this Nation was extinct. They used in matters of copulation,
to go to their neighboring men thrice in a year: if they brought forth
males, they sent them to their Fathers; if females, they kept them, and trained
them up in all martial discipl^ne.
The whole Country of Cappadocia, was made a Roman province after the death of
Archelaus, the next successor to Ariobarzanes.

15 LYCAONIA.
On the South of Cappadocia is LYCAONIA, watered with the river Lycus. In the
South of this Province where it consineth with Lycia, Stephanus
is the hill Chimaera: in the top whereof Lions roared; in the middle goats
grazed; and in the lower part serpents lurked. Hence is Chimaera by the Poets
fained to be^ Mo^ster, having the head of a Lion, the body of a goat, the tail
of a serpent. Quoque Chimaera jugo medijs in partibus hircum,
Pectus and ora Leae, caudam Serpentis habebat.
Chimaer her mid parts from a Goat did take,
From Lion head and breast; tail from a snake.
This mountain was made habitable by Bellerophon, who is therefore fained to
have killed the Monster Chimaera. The chief Cities are Iconium, once the
regal seat of the Aladine Sultans. 2 List^a where Timothy was borne: where
Paul and Barnabas healing a Criple, were by the blind Ethnicks adored as Gods;
calling Paul, Mercury; and Barnabas, Jupiter: Howsoever not long after, at the
instigation of some malicious Jews, they stoned Paul, and cast him out of
their city, where he recovered, and departed with Barnabas. Acts 14th.

16 PISIDIA. 17 ARMENIA.
On the East side of Lycaonia is PISIDIA, whose cities are Antiochia and
Lisinia. The people of this Country having offended Cyrus the brother of
Artaxerxes Mnemon, gave him good occasion to levy an Army, pretending revenge
on them; but intending to dispossess his brother of the Persian Monarchy. But
Tisaphernes, Lieftenant for the King in Asia, seeing greater preparations then
were sufficient, to oppress the weak Pisidians, made the King acquainted with
his suspicions, who accordingly provided for resistance. Cyrus Army consisted
of 12000 Grecians, and 100000 Persians: the Kings forces were no fewer then
9000000 fighting men. They meet at Cunaxa not far from Babylon, where Cyrus
lost both the victory and his life. The Grecians who had made their side good,
and stood on terms of honorable composition, being by Tisaphernes betrayed,
lost the best of their company. The rest under the conduct of Xenophon, made a
safe retreit home, in despite of 200000 men, which followed at their heels.
This Xenophon was an agent in, and the historian of this expedition, by whose
example the Spartans, and after them the Macedonians, first attempted the
conquest of Persia. Eastward from Pisidia is ARMENIA MINOR, which by some is
thought to be the Land of Ararat, on whose mountains the Arc rested, the
Remnants of which, Josephus says, were in his time to be seen. The chief
town is Melexona, whose territory is abundant in oil and wine.

Asia being totally subdued by the Persians, Diod^rus.
was not long after taken from them by the Grecians, under the prosperous
ensigns of victorious Alexander. After his decease, the Empire being divided
among his Captains: Asia fell to the share of Antigonus; whose son Demetrius
seized on the kingdom of Macedonia, and left Asia, subdued by Seleucus Nicanor
K. of Syria and the East, being also one of Alexanders heirs. The sixth from
this Seleucus, was Antiochus, called the Great; who waging war with young
Ptolomy Philopater, King of Egypt, committed by his father to the protection of
the Romans, provoked the Senate of Rome to send Scipio (surnamed for his Asian
victories) Asiaticus, against him; who compelled him to forsake Asia, which the
Romans presently took into their possession. Other motives there were to cause
this war; as that Antiochus entertained Annibal, being a professed enemy to
the state of Rome; that he demanded restitution of the City Lysimachia,
possessed by the Romans; that he had took into his protection Thoas, a Prince
of Aetolia, revolted from the service of their state; but chiefly that the
Romans by the overthrow of a King so potent, might add to their fame and
Dominion. Under the Romans this province long continued, till the Turks by
little and little, wrested it from the Empire of Greece, and subdued it to
their Mahumetan superstition.

Thus much of Anatolia.

OF SYRIA.
SYRIA has on the East Euphrates, on the West the Mediterranean Sea, on the
South Palestine, and on the North Cilicia, and other parts of Asia Minor.

The inhabitants of this Country are either Mahumetans, or Christians.
Brerewood.
These latter are subdivided into different Sects of Melchi^es, Iacobites, and
Maronites: which as in the main points they agree with the Greek Church, so in
certain other they are repugnant unto it. The last of these, viz: the
Maronites, are only found in mount Libanus, so much renowned in holy Writ for
its goodly Cedars, Their Patriarch is always called Peter, he has under his
jurisdiction 9 Bishops, and resideth commonly at Tripolis. They held heretofore
diverse opinions with the Grecians; but in the Papacy of Clement 8th, they
received the Roman Religion. They possess in this hilly Country many
scattered Villages, amongst all which, four only in all Syria speak the
Syriacke tongue. viz: 1 Eden, a small village, yet a Bishops See, Biddulph.
called by the Turks, Anchora; 2 Hatcheeth; 3 Sharrie, where the Patriarch of
these Maronites sometimes resideth, and 4 Bolosa, or Blouza. These Maronites,
though they have acknowledged the Popes supremacy; yet they retain still the
Liturgy of the Greeks. They took this name from one Maron, who is mentioned in
the fifth act of the Constantinopolitan Counce^l. The Iacobites are so called
from Iacobus Syrus, who lived Anno 5^0. Their opinions contrary to the Church
of Greece and Rome, are 1. They acknowledge but one Will, Nature, and Operation
in Christ. 2 They use Circumcision in both sexes. 3. They sign their Children
with the sign of the Cross, imprinted with a burning iron. 4 They affirm
Angels to consist of 2 substances, fire, and light. The Patriarch of this Sect
is always called Ignatius, he keeps his residence at Carami in Mesapotamia,
and i^ said to have 160000 Families under his jurisdiction. The Melchites are
subject to the Patriarch of Antiochia, and are of the same tenets with the
Grecians, excepting only, that they celebrate divine service as solemnly on the
Saturday, as the Sunday. They take their denomination from Melchi, which in the
Syriacke, signifies a King; because in matters of religion the people followed
the Emperors injunctions, and were of the Kings Religion, as the saying is.
Here are also in the mountainous parts of this Country, between it and Armenia
mayor, a certain people whom they call Curdi or C^ordes, descended, as it is
though^, of the ancient Parthians. These men worship the devil, and as
themselves judge, not without reason. For God (they say) is a good man, and
will do no body harm: but the devil is a knave, and must be pleased, lest he
hurt them.

The chief rivers are Euphrates, Stephanus.
which watring the Garden of Eden, has his fountain in the Mountains of
Armenia, and running by Babylon, disgorgeth it self into the Persian sea: and
Orontis, which rising about mount Libanus, and visiting the walls of Selencia,
gently saluteth the Mediterranean Sea.

This country is divided into three Provinces, viz; Phoenicia, 2 Caelo-Syria,
and 3 Syro-Phoenicia.

PHOENICIA lies South toward Canaan the chief cities are 1 Ptolomais or
Acris, or Acon, famous for so many christian Armies which have besieged it:
especially those of our Richard the 1, Camden.
and Edward the 1. This latter was here treacherously wounded by an Infidel,
with a poisoned knife, whose venom could by no means be assuaged, til his most
virtuous wife (proposing herein a most rare example of conjugall love) sucked
out the poison, which her love made sweet to her delicate palate. And as for
Richard, he grew so feared and redoubted among the Turks, that when their
little children began to cry, their mothers would say unto them, peace, King
Richard is coming: and when their horses at any time started, they would put
spur unto them; and say, What you iades, do you think King Richard is here?
2 Sarepta, where Elias (who had formerly lived in mount Carmel nigh adjoining)
was sustained in a famine by a widow, whose son he raised from death. 3 Sido^,
once a famous city, now contracted into a narrower compass, is governed by the
Emir or Prince of the Drusians; who being the offspring of the Christians,
which under the conduct of Godfrey D. of Bulloine, descended into these parts,
do still maintain their liberty against the Turks; though they have in a
manner forgot their religion, yet so that they embraced not Mahumetanisme, and
are rather of no faith, then any. The white turbant they wear like the Turks;
circumcision they abhor; from wine they refrain not, and account it lawful
most unlawfully to marry with their own daughters. They are a people very
warlike, stoue, and resolute; and have with great valor resisted all the
attempts and wars of the Turkish Sultans. The country which they possess, is
environed with the confines of Ioppa above Caesarea and Palestine; and within
the rivers of Jordan and Orontes, stretching it self even to the plains of
Damasco. They were in the time of Amurath the 3d, governed by 5 Emirs or
Princes, one of which was ManOgli, who so resolutely resisted Ibrahim Bassa,
Anno 1585. This Man-Ogli then kept his Court and residence at Andirene a strong
place situate on a hill, and was of that wealth, that he sent to make his peace
unto the aboue-named Ibrahim, 320 Arcubuses, 20 packs Andirene silks, and
50000 Ducats; At a second time he presented him with 50000 ducats more, 480
arcubuses, 1000 goats, 150 Camels, 150 Buffes, 1000 Oxen, and 200 weathers; by
which rich gifts we may not a little conjecture at the revenue of the present
Emir of S^don, who since the year 1600, has reduced almost all the Countries
belonging once to five Princes, under his own Empire, as containing the Towns
and territories of Gazir, Barut, Sidon, Tyrc, Acre, Saffet (or Tiberias) his
seat of residence, Nazareth, Cana, Mount Tabor, Elkiffe, etc. This present Emir
by name Faccardin^, was not long since driven out of his Country by the Turk,
and forced to fly to Florence: but he again recovered his own, laid siege to
Damascus, and caused a notable rebellion in Asia, not yet quenched. 4 Tire,
famous for her purples, and diverse colonies dispersed over all the world by her
Citizens. Here was once a kingdom of great antiquity, and long continuance;
the most famous of her kings were Hyram, in a strict bond and confederacy with
Solomon: and Pigmaleon the brother of Dido, Plutarch.
who built Carthage. This gave way to the Persian Monarchy, and after the
overthrow of Darius, was beleagured by Alexander, who with great expense of men
and money, together with extraordinary labor and toil, at last took it. This
rendition of the town was diuined by the Soothsayers which followed the camp of
Alexander, upon a dream which he not long before had. For dreaming that he had
disported himself with satyrs, the diuiners only making of one word two; found
that (...) was no more then (...), that is, Tua Tyrus; and it happened
accordingly. It is now under the Emir of the Drusians. This country abounds
with wheat, honey, oil, and balm: the lower part whereof was the seat of
Asher, of whom Moses prophesied, Deuteronomy. 33.24. That he should dip his foot in
oil.

The second Province of Syria is CAELOSYRIA, whose chief cities are 1
Hieropolis, famous for the Temple and worship of the Syrian goddess; the
tricks and iugglings of whose Priests to deceive the silly people, who list to
see; may find them abundantly described in the Metamorphosis of Apuleius: the
relation whereof seems to be a discourse of the tricks of legerdemaine, which
the Friars and Pardoners at this day use in the Papacy. 2 Damascus so
pleasantly situate, that the impostor Mahomet would never enter into it;
fearing (as himself used to say) lest being ravished with the ineffable
pleasures of the place, he should forget the business about which he was sent;
and make this town his Paradise. For it is seated in a very fruitful soil,
bearing grapes all the year, and girt round about with most curious and
odoriferous gardens. This town is famous for her founders, being Abraham's
servants; for the tomb of Zacharias; and for the conversion of Paul, who here
first preached the Gospel, and escaped the snares of his enemies, being let
down the walls of the house by a basket: The Syrian kings mentioned in the
Bible, were of this Syria, as Benhadad etc.

The third Province is SYRO-PHOENICIA, whose chief cities are 1 Beritus a
famous mart-town, formerly called Iulia faelix, and now Barutti; nigh unto
which, St George delivered the Kings daughter, by killing of the Dragon. In
memory of which exploit, there was a castle and an oratory built in the same
place and consecrated to S. George, by whose name the valley adjoining is yet
called. 2 Aleppo, so called of Alep, which signifies milk, which here is in
great plentyl it is called in the Scriptures Aram Sobab, 2 Samuel 8.3. This town
is famous for a wonderful confluence of Merchants from all parts, who come
hither to traffic. 3 Biblis. 4 Tripolis, so called because it has bin thrice
built: and 5 Antiochia, built and named by Antiochus her founder. Two things
does this city glory in; first that she is the Metropolis of all Syria; and
therefore Hadrian being offended with the citizens hereof, intended to have
separated Phoenicia from Syria; Ne tot civitatum metropolis Antiochia diceretur
(says Gallicanus.) Secondly, because the Disciples of JESUS were here first
called Christians; a people by the Heathen so hated, that they ceased not to
malice and slander them continually, as men that at their devout meetings
devoured infants, and had carnal company with their mothers and sisters. Among
the rest, Tacitus has shot his sooles bolt, calling them, homines per flagitia
invisos, and noviffima exempla meritos. Yet this defamation notwithstanding,
they grew in 40 years to that number, that they were a terror to their
enemies; who suggested by that old enemy of piety, the Devil, grievously
afflicted them with ten general persecutions under the Emperors, 1 Nero, Ao
67. 2 Domitianus, Ao 96. 3 Traianus, Ao 100. 4 Marcus Antoninus, Ao 167. 5
Severus, Ao 195. 6 Maximinus, Ao 137. 7 Decius Ao 250. 8 Valerianus, Ao 259. 9
Aurelianus, Ao 278. 10 Dioclesianus, Ao 293. These persecutions were so cruel,
that S. Hierom writes in one of his Epistles, that every day in the year
there were murdered 5000, excepting only the first day of January: But sanguis
martyrum, semen Ecclesiae; and this little grain of mustard seed, planted by
Gods own hand, and watered with the blood of so many holy men, grew so great a
tree, that it dispersed its branches through every Province and city of the
World. Neither were the Imperial armies without a wonderful number of them, as
appeared when Julian the Rennegate having vomited out his soul with a
Vicistitandem Galile: They elected Iovinianus Emperor, with this joyful
acclamation, Christiani omnes sumus. Constantine the Great, put an end to all
persecutions, and embraced the Christian Faith on this occasion. At the same
time that Constantine was appointed Emperor in Britain. Maxentius was by the
Praetorian soldiers chosen at Rome; and Lycinus nominated successor by
Maximinus. Against these, Constantine marching, and being in his mind somewhat
pensive, he cast his eyes up to Heaven: Where he saw in the sky a lightsome
pillar in form of a Cross, wherein were engraven these words, (...), In hoe
vince. The night following, our Savior appeared to him in a vision, commanding
him to bear the figure of that Cross in his banners, and he should overcome
his enemies. Constantine obeys the vision, and is accordingly victorious.
After this he not only favored the Christians, but became one of that holy
profession. This is the story according to Soc^ates Scholasticus, who writes,
that the banner was in his time reserved in the Emperors palace. But Zozimus
an Heathen historian, partly upon malice to the Christians in general, and
partly on a particular grudge to this Emperor, of whom he never speaks well,
delivers the cause of his conversion far otherwise. Questionless he was a
great instrument of Gods glory; In whose time God gave such increase to his
Gospel, that at last it got the upper hand of Heathenisme: And here
flourished, till the sins of the people provoked God to remove his Candle-stick
from those places, and leave them as a prey to misbeleeuers and Idolaters.

In Syria also was the town and Province of Palmyra, famous in that it was
under the government of Zenobia; a woman of such worth, that she was counted
worthy the purple roabe, and to stand in opposition with Gallienus for the
Empire of the world. She swayed these Eastern parts during the reign of
Gallienus, Claudius, Quintilius, and Aurelian: who taking her prisoner, led her
in triumph through Rome, ita ut ea specie nihil unquam esset pompabilius.

The Syrians are called in the Bible Aramites, who were an obscure people
subject to the Persians, and subdued by Alexander the Great; after whose death,
this Country, together with Persia, and other adjacent Provinces, fell to the
share of Seleucus Nicanor, a man strangely preferred. For being at the first,
Governor of Chaldea only, he was forced to leave Babylon, and forsake his
Province, for fear of Antigonus, then dreadful to all the Macedonian
Captains; and to fly into Egypt, where he became Ptolomies Admiral. After,
Ptolomie fighting a pitched field with Demetrius, son to Antigonus, took
Seleucus with him; and having won the battle, gave him aid and license to
recover his former government. Seleucus well-beloved of the people, soon made
himself Master, not of Chaldea only, but of all the Persian Provinces beyond
Euphrates, and not long after (being seconded by his good friend Ptolomie,
Cassander, and Lysimachus) he encountered Antigonus at Ipsus in Cilicia, where
Antigonus himself was slain, and his whole Army routed. This victory made
Seleucus Lord of all Asia; from whence passing over into Europe, he vanquished
and slew Lysimachus: seven months after which victory, he was slain by
Ptolomie Ceraunus, whose patron and protector he was: being yet the last
surviuour of all Alexanders Princes, and the only possessour of all the
Dominions which his Master had, either by inheritance, or conquest. His
successors although they were Lords of all Asia, yet since in Syria they kept
their residence, were commonly called Kings of Syria.

Antiochus Griphus 29 3874 19 Seleucus and Antioch. Cyzicenus 20 Philip and
Demetrius. During the reigns of these kings, civil wars had devoured all
the blood royal of Seleucus. 3884 21 Tigranes king of Armenia, the Seleucidan
stock thus failing, was chosen, and established King of Syria; and was the
most potent King of this Country, after the death of Antiochus Magnus: as being
King of this Syria by election; of Armenia by succession; of Media and Assyria
by conquest; and having a superintendencie over the Parthians, presuming on his
strength, he sideth with Mithridates (whose daughter he had married) against
the Romans, and is vanquished by Lucullus: who with the loss of five Romans
only, and the wounds of an hundred, is reported to have slain of his enemies
above 100000 men. Finally, being again broken and vanquished by Lucullus, he
yielded himself to Pompey, who being appointed Lucullus successor, deprived
him of the honor of ending that war; and retaining to himself Armenia and
Media only, he left all Syria to the Romans, having reigned 18 years: The
government of this Country under these new Lords, was accounted to be one of
the greatest honors of the Empire; the Prefect here of having almost regal
jurisdiction over all regions on this side Euphrates, with a superintendencie
over Egypt. Niger the concurrent of Severus, was Prefect here; and also
Cassius Syrus, who being a native of this Country, and well-beloved by reason of
his moderate and plausible demeanor, had almost tumbled M. Antoninus out of
his Throne. On this occasion it was enacted by the Senate, that no man
hereafter should have any militar or legal command in the Province, where he
was borne: Lest perhaps supported by the natural propension of the people, one
of their own Nation; and hartned by the powerablenesse of his friends, he might
appropriate it to himself, which was common to the Senate and people of Rome.
From the Romans this Province, and Palestine (as we shall presently show you)
were extorted by the Saracens.
Thus much of Syria.

PALESTINE has on the East Euphrates, on the West the Mediterranean sea: on
the North it is bounded with Phoenicia; on the South with Arabia.

This Country was first called the land of Canaan, from Canaan the son of Cham.
Secondly, the land of Promise, because the Lord had promised it to Abraham and
his seed; thirdly, Israel of the Israelites, so called from Jacob, who was
surnamed Israel; fourthly Judea, from the Jews or people of the tribe of
Judah; fifthly Palestine, quasi Philistim, the land of the Philistines, a potent
Nation herein; and now sixthly the Holy land, because herein was wrought the
work of our salvation.

It is situate between the third and fourth climats, Maginus.
the longest day being 14 hours and a quarter. It is in length 200 miles, and
not above 50 in breadth; yet of that salubrity of air, and fertility of soil,
flowing with milk and honey: that before the coming of the Israelites it
maintained 30 Kings: and afterward the two potent kingdoms of Israel and
Judah, in which David numbered one million, and 300000 fighting men, besides
them of the tribe of Benjamin and Levi.

The people hereof were of a middle stature, Josephus.
strong of body, unconstant and resolute; and are now accounted a periurious
vagabond nation, and great usurers. Their Religion in its purity was first
taught by divine inspiration; afterward published in the two Tables of the Law
at mount Sinai; but now they have added their own inventions, giving as much
credit to the Talmud, as to the Scriptures. They were of 3 sorts or sects; 1
Jews, 2 Samaritans, 3 Proselites. The first were of the natural language, and
original of the Tribes: the second were such as Salmanasser placed in Samaria,
from whence he carried the Israelites captives; these retained only the five
books of Moses: the third were such as came from other Countries to learn the
Religion of the Jews. They were subdivided also into other sects, as Pharisees,
Sadduces, Esseni, and Scribes; etc. Of these the Scribes are resembled to the
Canonists in the Church of Rome; and are thought to have received that name
about the time that David divided the Levites into certain Classes or Forms.
Their office was double; 1 to read and expound the Law in the Temple and
Synagogues: and 2ly to execute the office of a Judge, in ending and composing
actions. The Esseui are so called from Ascha, that is, facere; because they
wrought with their hands. They lived together, as it were, in Colleges, and in
every one had their (...), or Chapel for their devotion. All their estates
they inioyed in common, and received no man into their fellowship, unless he
would give all that he had into their Treasury; and not then neither under a
three years probationership. The Sadduces derive their name either from Sado^,
who is said to have lived about the time of Alexander the Great, and to be the
Author of this Sect: or from Sedech, which signifies Justice. They believed
not the being of Angels or spirits, the resurrection of the body, and that
there was a Holy Ghost, they credited not, they received only the Pentateuch,
and in many other things agreed with the Samaritans. The Pharisees owe their
name to Phares, which signifies both interpretari and separare, as being both
interpreters of the Law, and separatists from the rest of the Jewish Church.
They held the contrary opinions to the Sadduces, and besides the Pentateuch, or
five books of Moses, adhered also unto traditions. They denied also the sacred
Trinity; they held the fulfilling of the Law to consist in the outward
ceremonies; they relied more on their own merits, then Gods mercy; they
attributed most things to destiny; and refused commerce with Publicans and
sinners. Their Philacteries were broad scrolls of parchment bound about their
heads, wherein were written the 10 Commandments, vainly so interpreting that
of De^ter. cap. 6. verse. 8: mou^ buntur super oculos tuos.

The chief rivers of this Country are Cedron, and 2 Jordan. This latter
arising out of Mount Libanus, and having run a long course in a narrow
channel, first augmenteth his bed in the sea or lake of Galilee; then again
the waters are contracted, til they expatiat themselves in the sea of Tiberias
or Genesareth; and lastly finisheth his course in the Dead sea; a^ sea which
has no intercourse with the Ocean; a sea because salt: dead, because no living
thing can endure its bituminous savor; from abundance of which matter, it is
also called Lacus Asphaltites. Nigh unto this sea once stood the infamous
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, destroyed with fire from heaven, and now there
grows a tree whose apples exceeding fair to sight, moulder away to nothing as
soon as touched.

This Country has had diverse divisions; as first into the several Nations of
the Amorites, Perezites, Philistines, etc. After the conquest of these people,
it was divided between the people of Israel into 12 Tribes, as the Tribe of
Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, etc. When Jeroboam had made that great breach in the
kingdom of David, it was divided into the kingdoms of Judah and Israel: of
which the former contained only the two Tribes of Judah and Benjamin; the latter
the other ten. When the Israelites were transported into Assyria, and other
Inhabitants sen^ hither; these new comers were from Samaria the chief City of
their Province, named Samaritans; and when the men of Judah returned from the
captivity of Babylon, then began they first to be called Jews. At what time
the whole Country fell upon that division which it still retains, viz: into
the four Provinces of Galilaea, Judah, Idumaea, and Samaria.

GALILEA is the most Northern part of Palestin^, it is divided into the Higher
and the Lower. The higher Galilie is also called Galilea gentium, either
because it is between the rest of the Holy land and the Gentiles; or else
because it was by K. Solomon given unto Hiram King of Tire. It contained the
tribes of Asher, Naphtali, and a part of the Tribe of Dan. The chief Cities
of the Tribe of Asher, were 1 Acon. 2 Tire. 3 Sidon. 4 Sarepta, all which we
have before mentioned in our description of Phoenicia. 5 Ap^ek, whose wall
falling down, slew 27000 of Benhadads Soldiers; after 100000 of them had bin
slain by Ahab. 6 Giscala the birthplace of John or Iehochanan, one of the
three seditious in the City of Jerusalem, at the siege of it by Titus. In the
Tribe of Napthalim the principal towns are and were, Iabin where the 24 Kings
met to give battle to Joshua: to the King of this Town also was Sisera
Leiftenant, who was overthrown by Debora, and slain by Iael. It was also
called Hazor. 2 Capernaum (seated on the influxe of Jordan into the Sea of
Galilie) so often mentioned in the Scriptures. 3 Cinnereth called afterward
Genesareth, whence the Lake or Sea of Galile is called the Lake of Genesareth.
That the children of Dan were here in part seated is easily proved out of
Joshua, the 19. and 47 verse. where it is said that the coast of the children of
Dan being too little for them they went up, and fought against Leshem, which
they took and called Dan. This Leshem, is rendered by some interpreters Laish,
and is the place where Abraham vanquished Chedorla^mer and his confederats. The
other Cities are Hamath. 2 Ramath. 3 Ziddim, and 4 Cedesh. But whether these
four Cities belonged also to the Da^ites, or were accounted as appertaining
to Napthalim, I cannot determine. In this Country are the two spring heads of
Jordan, whereof the one is named Ior, the other Dan.

The Lower Galile contains the Tribes of Zabulon, and Isachar. In the Tribe
of Zabulon, the chief Cities are or were Gaba, called since Hippopolus, of a
regiment of horse, there garisond by Herod. 2 Cana where our Savior wrought
his first miracle, turning water into wine. 3 Bethsaida, the birthplace of
Peter, Andrew, and Philip. 4 Tiberias on the Sea of Galile, which is also
called the Lake of Tiberias. In this City was Matthew called, and the daughter
of Iairus raised from death to life. 5 Sephoris made by Herod Antipas the
regal seat of the Lower Galilea. and 6 Nazareth, where Mary was saluted with
those joyful tidings by an Angel as she sat in her chamber. Of this chamber
I cannot but insert this famous legend. It was after the virgins death had in
great reverence by the Christians, and remained in this town till the
Holy Land was by the Turks and Saracens subdued Anno 1291. Then was it most
miraculously transported into Sclauonia; but that place being unworthy of the
Virgins divine presence, it was by the Angels carried over into the sea coast
of Italy Anno 1294. That place also being infected with thieves and pirates, the
Angels removed it to the little village of Loretto, where her miracles were
quickly divulged: Insomuch that Paul the 2d built a most stately Church over
this Chamber; and Xistus the fifth made the Village a City. And thus we have
the beginning of our Lady of Loretto. Here is in this Tribe also the brook
Chison, and mount Tabor, where Christ was transfigured. Here also is the high
seated City of Iotapata, which Josephus the historian, being governor of both
Galilies, so bravely defended against Vespasian. In the Tribe of Isachar the
chief Cities are Tarichaea with great difficulty taken in the Jewish wars.
2 Enhadda, nigh unto which Saul slew himself, and 3 Daberoth, seated in the
valley of Israel: a valley famous for the many battails fought in it. As of
Gedeon against the Madianites; Saul against the Philistines; Ahab against the
Syrians; the Christians against the Sarracens; and John against Iehoram. In
this Lower Galile was our Savior very conversant, wherefore Julian the
Apostata called him a Galilean.

2 SAMARIA is not here taken in that large extent by which it comprehended the
kingdom of the ten Tribes; but in a stricter limit for that part of Palestine
which is seated between Iudaea and Galilie. The people hereof were as we have
said the discendants of such Assyrians, as were by Salmanassar sent hither to
possess the inheritance of the captive Israelites. They were to the Jews in
their adversity most deadly enemies: but when God had given them rest and
felicity, who but the Jews shall be their Cosens. This hollow-hearted dealing so
offended the Jews that they reputed the Samaritans for reprobates and
schismatickes. So that when they went about to calumniate our blessed Savior,
they could find no more grievous reproach, then to say he was a Samaritan, or
(as if they had been alone) one that conuersed with Devils. And though the
Jews would not vouchsafe to marry with them, yet they inhabited most of their
good Towns; some of which they had totally wrested into their own hands: in
the others they were mingled. This Province of Samaria comprehended the Tribes
of Ephraim, Gad, Ruben; and the two half Tribes of Manasses; the one situate
on the Mediterranean, the other beyond Jordan. In the half Tribe of Manasses
on the Mediterranean, the chief Cities are Bethsan, which being grown old,
was by the Scythians at their irruptions into Asia the less, reedified, and
named Scythopolis. On the walls hereof did the Philistines hang the bodies of
Saul and his sons. 2 Thebes where the bastard Abimelec was wounded by a
stone, which a woman threw from the wall; and perceauing his death nigh,
commanded his Page to slay him, that it might not be said he died by the hands
of a woman. 3 Ephra, or H^phra, where Gedeon dwelt, and nigh unto which the
said Abimelech slew 70 of his brethren; a heathenish cruelty, and at this day
practiced by the Turks. 4 Endor where Saul went to consult with a witch. 5
Iezreel, a regal City, in the which I^ram kept Court when he was deposed and
slain by Iehu. Here was Naboth stoned for his vineyard, and here did Dogs
lick the blood of Iezabell. 6 Caesarea Palestina, first called Straton, but
after by this name, which Herod who new built and beautified it, gave to it in
honor of Caesar. Here Paul disputed against Tertullus, in the presence of
Festus the Roman President: here Cornelius was baptized by Peter: and here
Herod Agrippa was smitten by an Angel, and eaten of worms; after his
rhetorical Oration, which the people called the voice of God and not of man. 7
Antipatris, whether the Soldiers lead Paul by the command of Lysias. 8
Megiddo, etc. In the Tribe of Ephraim, the chief Cities are Samaria, the
metropolis of the kingdom of Israel, built by Omri King hereof, a magnificent
and stately city, and was called Samaria from Shemer, of whom the hill whereon
the City stood, was bought. It was by Hircanus the High Priest beaten to the
ground, but repaired again by Herod, who to flatter Caesar called it Sebaste,
for the Greeks called Augustus (...). Here lay the bodies of Elisha, and John
the Baptist. 2 Bethel where Jeroboam erected one of his golden Calfes, by which
he made Israel to sin. 3 Sichem which was by Simeon and Levi destroyed, for
the rauishment of Dinah. Here R^b^am rejecting the Counsel of the old men, and
following that of the young; made that irreparable schism in the kingdom of
David. Near unto this Town Judas Maccabaeus overthrew Lysias. 4 Lidda where
Peter (virtute Christi, non sua) healed the sick of the palsy. It is since
called Diosp^lis, and in it S. George was beheaded. 5 Ramatha or Arimathea, the
City of Joseph, who buried the body of Christ. 6 S^lo seated on a mountain so
called, in which the Ark of the Lord was kept, till the Philistines took it.

On the other side of Jordan was the habitation of the children of Gad, Reuben,
and the other half of Manasses. The country of these last was called Basan,
whose last King was Ogg, a man of that large proportion, Sr W. Ral. and Adricom.
that his bed made of iron, was 9 Cubits long, and four broad. It has been
also in the time of the Roman Monarchy called Trachonitis, because it is
bounded Eastward with the hills of Gilead, which the Cosmographers of that age
called Trachones. Some also call it Iturea, but improperly: for Iturea was
seated more toward Syro-Phoenicia and North to Damascus, and was so called from
Ietur one of the sons of Ismael. It was also a part of the Country of
Decapolis, so named of ten prime Cities in it, which extended from Bethsan
South, to Libanus North; from the mountains of Gilead East, to the
Mediterranean West. Of this Decapolis we find frequent mention in the new
Testament, as Math. 4.25. Mark. 7.31. etc. Thus having cleared my passage in
respect of the diversity of names. I will proceed to the Cities: The chief
whereof are Butis, Berenice, or Pella demolished by Alexander Iannaeus King of
the Jews. 2 Edrey, the royal seat of Og King of Basan. 3 Astaroth sometimes
peopled with Giants, for which cause the Country adjoining is termed the
Region of Giants. Here Astoreth the Goddess of the Zidonians was worshipped in
the form of a Sheep. 4 Gaulon where the sect of the Gaulonites began, and 5
Hus, the birthplace of Job. The chief Cities of the Gadites are Gadara and
Gergesa, the people whereof entreated our Savior to depart from their coasts:
for to both these people the story is attributed: by Matthew to the last; by
Luke and Mark to the first: not that they were both one, but because they were
neighbor Cities, and so their bounds confounded. 3 Iab^sh Gilead, the
Citizens whereof buried the bodies of Saul and his sons. 4 Bethharam rebuilt
by Herod Antipas, and called Julius in honor of Livia, Augustus wife,
translated into the Julian family. 5 Succoth. 6 Ramoth Gilead where Jacob and
Laban swore each to other; where Ahab seeking to recover it from the Syrians
lost his life; and in the leaguer of which Iehu was chosen king. 7 Rabba (now
Philadelphia) under the walls whereof Vriah was slain by the command of David.
At the siege of this Town, that most excellent and politic Captain Ioab
having brought it to terms of yielding, sent for the King to have the honor
of taking in so defersible a City. In the Tribe of Reuben the chief Cities
are 1 Machaerus an exceeding strong City, standing upon so high a rock that
it is every way inaccessible. In this town John the Baptist was slain. 2 Beth
Bara where John baptized, and where Moses made his divine exhortations to the
people, 3 Abel-Sittim seated in the Country called the plains of Moab. This
was the last encamping place of the Israelites under Moses. It was after called
simply Sittim, and yielded the wood so often mentioned in the Scripture whereof
the Arc was made. 4 Ramath Baal, to which place Balack brought Balaam to curse
the people. This was the chief City of the worshippers of Baal; which was, as
some say, the same with Priapus.

IDVMEA, was the habitation of the Edomites, the offspring of Esau, who also
inhabited the Country South of Israel, called Mount Seir, or the wilderness of
Edom; in which the children of Israel were stung with the fiery Serpents; and
which is counted a part of Arabia the stony. This Idumea of which we treat,
was not wholly in the hands of the Edomites, but possessed in part by the
Philistines, a people which of all other most vexed the Israelites, and kept
them in that bondage, that they left the^ not a Smith in any of their Cities
and Towns to sharpen their irons with. These Philistines together with the
Edomites were by King David made subject, but never could they be expelled the
land. In the reign of King Ioram, we find how the Philistines brake into
Judah, ransacked the Kings palace, and took prisoners his wife and children.
What was the end of this nation, I as yet know not; this I answer, that for
the puissance of this people, the whole Country was by heathen writers termed
Palestine. In the reign of King Ioram, also the Edomits revolted; and
continued in that free state till the time of Hireanus the high Priest: who
taking most of their Towns, made them subject to the Jews, compelled them to
be circumcised, and from thenceforth they were reputed as Jews. This Country
of Idumea contained the Tribes of Dan, and Simeon. The chief Cities of the
Tribe of Dan are Ioppe (now Iaffa) a famous Mart Town, where Jonah took ship
to fly unto Tarsus; where Peter raised Dorcas from death to life; and where he
lying at the house of Simon a Tanner, was in a vision taught the conversion of
the Gentiles. This City they report to have been built before the flood; and
here they say reigned Cepheus, whose daughter Andromeda was by Perseus
delivered from the sea monster; some of whose bones the people used to show to
strangers even till the flourishing of the Romans. Just as our Citizens of
C^ventrie and Warwick show the bones of the Dun-Cow of Dunsmeare heath, and
the bones of I know not what Giants shine by Earl Guy. 2 Gath the Country of
that huge Giant Goliath. 3 Accaron, or Ecron, where Bel-zebub was worshipped to
whom Ahaziah sent to inquire of his health. 4 Asotos or Asdad where was a
sumptuous temple built to the honor of the Idol Dagon; and near unto which
Judas Maccabeus was slain by Bacchides Leiftenant to Demetrius. 5 Ciriathiarim
where the Ark of the Lord twenty years was kept in the house of Aminadab,
viz: from the sending it home by the Philistines, till David fetched it to
Jerusalem. The chief Cities of Simeon, are 1 Ascalon where Semiramis was
borne; so also was Herod that killed the infants; who coming to be King of the
Jews, verified the prophecy of Isaak to his son Esau: that the children of
Esau should not only break the yoke of Jacob from off their neck, for that
happened under Ioram; but should also have dominion over them, which was now
fulfilled. 2 Gaza an exceeding fair and strong Town, in which the Persians
did lay the tributes and customs of these Western Provinces; from whence all
riches and treasures are also called Gaza. 3 Cariaths^pher, i. e. the City of
books, which some hold to be an Vniuersi^y, or the Academie of old Palestine. 4
Bersheba where Abraham and Abimelech swore to each other; where. Hagar wandered
with her son Ismael; and where Isaac dwelt for a long time. This Town was by
the Christians in their war in this Country well fortified, as bounding on
Arabia, and being the Southern limit of the holy land, which extends from
hence to Dan or Laish, North.

IVDAEA is of the same extent now, as it was when it was the kingdom of Judah,
containing the two great and puissant Tribes of Judah, and Benjamin. The chief
Cities in the Tribe of Judah are Arad situate in the entrance from the
Wilderness of Ed^m into Iudaea. 2 Cerioth or Carioth, the birthplace of Judas
Iscariot, who betrayed our Savior Christ. 3 Iethir or Iattir nigh unto which
was fought the memorable battle, wherein Asa King of Judah, by the help of
God, discomfited Zara King of the Arabians, whose army consisted of a Million
of fighting men. 4 Maresa the native soil of the Prophet Michah. Nere unto
this Town Judas Maccabaeus overthrew Gorgias. 5 Emaus, nigh unto which Judas
Maccabaeus (after he had formerly beaten Apollonius) gave Gorgias the third
overthrow. Here our Redeemer showed himself after his resurrection to two of
his Disciples: it was afterward called Nicopolis. 6 Hebron one of the
ancientest Cities of Canaan. It was the seat of the Giants called Anakim, or
the sons of Anak. This word Anak signifies a chain worn for ornament; and
it seems that this Anak enriched with the spoils of their enemies, wore a
chain of gold; leaving both the custom and name to his posterity. We read the
like of Manlius Torquatus in the Roman histories. This Town did Abraham buy
for a burial place for his dead, and in it his wife Sarah was first buried;
and after her, four of the Patriarchs. Adjoining to this Town is the plain of
Mamr^ where Abraham the father of the faithful sitting in his Tent, was
visited from heaven by God in the shape of a man. Here David kept his Court
before the winning of Jerusalem; to this place came the Tribes to anoint him
King over Israel; and hither came Absalom under the pretense of paying his
vows, to vsurp the kingdom of his father. 7 Tecoa, the City of Amos the
Prophet; as also of that woman, who by the words which Ioab put into her mouth,
persuaded the King to call Absolon from exile. In the Wilderness of Tecoa,
there assembled the inhabitants of Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir, to overthrow
Judah. But the Lord being appeased by the public fast, proclaimed and kept by
Iehosophat and the people, sowed dissentions amongst them; So that the children
of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir utterly to
slay and destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of
Seir, every one helped to destroy another. 8 Libna, a City seated in a corner
of Judah, running between the Tribes of Dan and Benjamin. This City revolted
from Ioram King of Judah, at the same time the Edomites did: and continued a
free state even as long as Judah continued a kingdom. 9. Ziph, in the
Wilderness whereof David hid himself from the fury of Saul. Hither when Saul
persued him, David came into his Camp (the watch being all a sleep) and took
thence his spear, and a Cruse of oil, and departed. Abishay would feign have
killed him; but David though he knew that Samuel had ministerially abdicated
Saul from the kingdom, and that himself was appointed in his steed; would not
touch him, but left him to the judgments of the Lord* whose anointed he was.
10 Bethlem, or (to distinguish it from another of this name in Zabulon, called)
Bethlem Iudae, where Christ was borne; and the innocent suffered for him,
before he had suffered for them. In this general Massacre of young children,
a son of Herod's which was at nurse, was also slain. Which being told unto
Augustus, he replied, he had rather be^ Herod's hog then his son. On the
frontire of this Country toward the Philistines, was that strong Castle, which
Herod repayring called Herodium; It was seated on a hill, the ascent unto
which, was made with 200 steps of marble exceeding fair and large. In this
Country also, are the hills of Engaddi, in a Cave of which David cut off the
lap of Saul's garment; and all along the bottom whereof were the gardens of
Balsamum or Opobalsamum: the trees of which were by Cleopatra (at such time as
she governed M. Antonie and the East) sent for to be replanted in Heliopolis of
Egypt; and Herod, who durst not deny them, plucked them up by the roots and
sent them to her.

In the Tribe of Benjamin, the chief cities are 1 Gilgal where Joshua first
did eat of the fruits of the land; where he circumcised such of the people as
were borne in the pera^bulation of the Wilderness, where he kept the Passover;
nigh to which he pitched up the 12 stones as a memorial to posterity, that the
waters of Jordan had divided themselves to give passage to the children of
Israel; and where Agag King of the Amalekites was hewne in pieces by Samuel. 2
Mispah famous in being the ordinary place of assembly for the whole body of the
people, in matters of war or peace; as also in that standing in the midst of
Canaan, it was (together with Gilgal) made the seat of justice, to which Samuel
went yearly to give judgment to the people. 3 Gebah the North border of the
kingdom of Judah, toward Israel. 4 Gibba, where the abusing of the Levites wife
by the young men of this town; had almost rooted the Tribe of Benjamin out of
the garden of Is^ael. 5 A^, a great and strong City, in the siege of which the
Israelites were first discomfited; but when by the death of Achan, who had
stolen the accursed things, the camp was purged; Iosuah by a warlike stratagem
surprised it. 6 Gibbon the mother City of the Gibeonites, who presaging the
irresistable victories of the Israelites, came to the Camp of Iosuah, and by a
wile obtained peace of Iosuah and the people. Saul about 400 years after slew
some of them, for which fact the Lord caused a famine of the land, which could
not be taken away till seven of Saul's sons were by David delivered unto the
Gibeonites, and by them hanged. This famine did God send, because in killing
these poor Gibeonites, the oath was broken, which Iosuah and the Princes swore
concerning them. 7 Jericho de^troyed by the sounding of Rams horns, was not
only leueld by Iosuah to the ground, but a curse inflicted on him that should
attempt the building of it. This curse notwithstanding, at the time when Ahab
reigned in Israel, which was about 500 years from the ruin of it; Hiel a
Bethelite, delighted with the pleasantnes of the place reedified it. But (as it
was foretold by Iosuah) as he laid the foundation of the walls, he lost his
eldest son; and when he had finished it, and was setting up the gates
thereof, he lost also his youngest. It may be Hiel when he began this work
minded, not the prophecy; it may be he believed it not: peradventure he thought
the words of Iosuah not so much to proceed from the spirit of prophecy, as
from an angry and vexed heart; they being spoken in way of wish or execration.
And it is possible, it may be he chose rather to build the eternity of his
name, upon so pleasing and stately a City; then on the lives and issue of two
young men. Over against this Jericho on the other side of Jordan, are the
mountains of Nebo, on which the Lord showed unto Moses the Country which he had
promised to the posterity of Jacob. 10 HIERVSALEM the City of the Lord, built
by Mel^hisedec Prince and Priest of Salem, in the Country of the Iebusites, and
therefore called Iebusalem, and by changing one letter only, Jerusalem. This
City was strongly seated on the mount Sion, and strengthened with a ditch cut
out of the maine rock, which was in depth 60, and in breadth 250 foot. It
continued unconquered for the first 400 years after the entrance of the
children of Israel; and when David attempted it; the people presumed so much on
the strength of the place, that they told him their blind and lame could desend
it against him. Notwithstanding David by the valor of Ioab, that fortunate and
courageous leader, carried the town, and made it the seat royal of the Kings
of Judah. Here was the most glorious and magnificent Temple built by Solomon, in
providing the materials whereof, there were 30000 workme^, which wrought by the
10000 a month in Lebanon: 70000 laborers that bare burdens* 80000 quarrymen
that hewed in the mountains: and of officers and overseers of the work, no
less then 3300 men. The description of this stately fabric you may read in
the first of Kings Chap. the 6 and 7. It was destroyed by Nabuchadnezar, at the
taking of Jerusalem, Ao. M. 3350. After the return of the Jews again from
the Babylonian captivity, it was rebuilt; but with such opposition of the
Samaritans, that the workmen were feign to hold their swords in one hand and
their tools in the other, to repulse, if need were, the violence of the enemy.
This Temple was not answerable to the state and magnificence of the former, so
that the Prophet Haggai had good occasion to say unto the people cap. 2. v. 3.
Who is lest among you that saw this house in her first glory? Is it not in your
eyes in comparison of it, as nothing? Moreover in five things it was defective.
For it wanted the pot of Manna which the Lord commanded Moses to lay up
before the testimony for a memorial, Exodus 6.32. 2ly The Rod of Aron, which
only among all the Rods of the Princes of Israel, budded: and was by God
commanded to be kept before the testimony, for a toke^ against the rebels
Datha^, Corah, and Abiram, Numb. 17.10. 3ly The Arc of the covenant, the
making whereof is described in the 25 of Exodus and the 10 v. And the placing of
it in the oracle, or Sanctum Sanctorum, is mentioned in the 1. of Kings, c. 6.
v. 19. 4ly The two Tables of the law written by Gods own finger, which were by
Moses placed in the Arc of the covenant, Exodus 4.20. Deuteronomy. 10.5. And 5ly The
fire of sacrifice which came down from heaven; whereof mention is made 2.
Chron. 17.1. and Leuit. 9.24. Which sire was by the Priests to be kept
continually burning. This Temple, partly because it was now ruinous, partly
because it was not magnificent enough, but principally to ^urry favor with the
Jews; Herod the Ascalonite plucked down and reedified; making it as little
inferior to the first, so much superior to the second. In this Temple our
blessed Savior and his Apostles preached salvation to Jew and Gentile. It was
finally destroyed by Titus the son of Vespasian on the tenth day of August,
on which day also the first Temple was consumed with fire by Nabuchadneza.
Certainly it is worth the noting (I hope I shall not herein be accounted
superstitious) to see how happy or unfortunate one and the same day is in
diverse causes. In the wars between the French and Spaniards for the
kingdom of Naples, Friday was observed to be very fortunate to the great
Captain Gonsalvo; he having on that day given the French many memorable
defeats. To Charles the fist, the 24 day of February was most lucky, for on
that day he was borne, on that he took King Francis prisoner, and on that he
received the imperial Crown at Bon^nia. To omit our Henry 7th, whose luckie
day was Saturday; I will return to this Temple, which on a Sabbath day, or
Saturday, was taken by Pompey, on the same by Herod, on the same by Titus.
After this overthrow, the Temple lay unbuilt and in rubbish* till the reign of
Julian that politic enemy of the Church; who to diminish the numbers of the
Christians, by the increase of the Jews, began again to build this Temple.
But no sooner were the foundations laid, but an earthquake cast them up again;
and fire from heaven consumed the tools of the workmen, with stones, timber,
and the rest of the materials. As for the City it self, it was reedified by
Aelius Adrianus, who named it Aelia, drove thence the Jews, and gave it unto
the Christians. This new City was not built in the place of the old, for
within this is mount Oliuet also comprehended. It is now famous for the Temple
of the S^pulchre built by Helena (whom most report to have been daughter to
Coylus a British King) mother to Constantine the great. Much ado had the good
Lady to find the place where the Lords body had bin laid; for the Jews and
Heathens had raised great hillocks on the place; and built there a Temple to
Venus. This Temple being plucked down, and the earth dug away, she found
the three crosses whereon our blessed Savior, and the two thieves had
suffere^. To know which of these was the right Cross, they were all carried
to a woman, who had long been visited with sickness, and now lay at the point
of death. The Crosses of the two thieves did the weak woman no good; but as
soon as they laid on her the Cross on which the Lord died, she leaped up and
was restored to her former health. This Temple of the Sepulcher even at the
first building, was highly reverenced and esteemed by the Christians of these
parts, and even until our days is it much resorted to, both by Pilgrims from
all parts of the Romish Church, who fondly and superstitiously hope to merit by
their journey: and also by diverse Gentlemen of the reformed Churches, who
travel hitherward; partly for curiosity, partly for love to the antiquity of
the place; and partly because their generous spirits imitate the heaven and
delight in motion. Whosoever is admitted to the sight of this Sepulcher, pays
nine Crowns to the Turkish Officers; so that this tribute only is worth to the
grand Signeur 80000 Ducats yearly.

All this while we have made no mention of the Levites, for they indeed made no
Tribe, but had assigned unto them 48 Cities for their habitations,
proportionably taken out of the 12 Tribes. So was it ordered by the Lord,
partly that they being set apart to his service, might be in every place ready
to instruct the people; and partly to fulfill the prophecy which he had spoken
by Jacob, who told Leui at his death, that he would divide him in Jacob, and
scatter him in Israel. The like fortune he prophesied to Simeon, of whom we
read in the 19 of Joshua, v. 19, that he had no settled habitation; but was
taken ^n, to inhabit a part of the portion of Judah. Now to make up the number
of the twelve Tribes, Joseph was divided into Ephraim, and Manasses: and the
Le^ites were reckoned to belong to that Tribe, within who^e territory that
City which they dwelt in stood. Their maintenance was from the tenths or
tithes, the first fruits, offerings, and sacrifices of the people: and as it is
in the 18th of Ioshuah v. the 17. The ^riesthood of the Lord was their
inheritance. There were of them four kinds, 1 Punies or Tirones, which from
their childhood till the 25 year of their age learned the duties of their
offices. 2ly, Graduates, (...), which having spent four years in the study of
the Law, were able to answer and oppose in it. 3ly Licentiates, (...), which
did actually exercise the Priestly function. And 4ly Doctors ( Rabbis, they
used to call them) who were the highest in degree.

The Jews called also Hebrews from Heber, one of Abraham's progenitors; or
Hebraei quasi Abrahaei: at their descent into Egypt were but 70 souls; being
the issue of Jacob and his 12 sons; namely 1 Ruben, 2 Simeon, 3 Leui, 4 Judah,
5 Zabulon, 6 Issachar, 7 Dan, 8 Gad, 9 Asher, 10 Naphali, 11 Joseph, 12
Benjamin. The posterity of these Patriarchs continued in bondage 215 years,
until the year of the world 2453: at which time the Lord, moved with their
oppressions by the Egyptians, with a strong hand delivered them; and placed
them in these parts inhabited by the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perezites, the
Iebusites, etc. At their first coming hither, and long after, they were
governed by Judges; whom God ordained, and the people elected: of whose acts,
as also of the Acts of the Kings, I hope I shall not need to make any mention;
there being none who either do not, or ought not to know them. I will only
observe Chronologically the times of their government, and specify such things
as the sacred penmen spared.

He was the last governor of Judea, which descended from the stock of David.
During the governments of these Captains since the Babylonian captivity, the
kingdom of the Jews was plagued on both sides by the Kings of Egypt and
Syria: who ransacked their Cities, slaughtered their people, made hauock of
their goods, and compelled them to eat forbidden flesh, and sacrifice to Idols.
To reform these enormities, Mattathias and his five sons resisted the
impetuous fury of Antiochus Epiphanes, and his Syrians; over whom when they had
victoriously triumphed, the Jews chose Judas, surnamed Macchabaus, one of the
worlds nine Worthies, for their Captain.

The Macchabaean Kings of Judah.
3862 1 Aristobulus the first King of Judah, after the Babylonian captivity,
starued his mother, and slew Antigonus his brother. 3863 2 Alexander a great
tyrant, slew of his subjects 50000 in battle; and commanded 800 of his
principal enemies to be hanged before his face. 27 3890 3 Alexandra or
Solomne, wife to Alexander. 9 3899 4 Hircanus, elder son to Alexander, was
disturbed in his succession by his younger brother Aristobulus; but was at
length firmly established in his Throne by Pompey: who carried Aristobulus,
with his sons Alexander and Antigonus, captives to Rome. Alexander escaping
out of prison, troubled the quiet of his Country, till he was surprised by
Gabinius, and slain by Seipio; after whose death Antigonus set free by Julius
Caesar, deprived Hircanus of his kingdom, and cut off his ears: revenge
suddenly followed this villainy; for he was slain by Marcus Antonius, and his
kingdom given to a stranger.
The strange Kings of Iewry.
3930 1 Herod the Ascalonite, son to Antipater, an Idumean, was by Octavius
Augustus created King of Iewry; at which time the kingdom being departed from
Judah* CHRIST was borne. 40 Ao C. 7. 2 Archelaus reigned king 10 years, and
then lost his principality, reserving only the title of Tetrarch; his partners
in rule being Philip, whose wife Herodias was; 2 Herod Antipas, who killed
John, and in whose time CHRIST suffered. 3 Lysanias. 40 3 Agrippa Herod was made
king of Judah, the other Tetrarchies being added to his dominions; he
imprisoned P^ter and James, and was finally stricken by an Angel, and eaten with
worms. 24 47 4 Agrippa minor, before whom Paul pleaded, was the last king of
the Jews; for in his time Jerusalem was overthrown, and the kingdom made a
Roman Province, Anno 73.
When Salmanassar had subdued the 10 tribes, and carried them captive, he
planted a new set of inhabitants in this country; that so fruitful and well
situate a part of his Empire might yield its just tribute; and not lie open to
the fury of the next invader. But the Romans not having (it seems) so much
policy or providence, as those whom they accounted barbarous; having laid the
Country desolate, left it unfurnished of new Colonies; whereby the Persians,
next the Saracens, and after them the Turks, entering the Roman Empire at this
door, have successively driven the Romans out of the whole house. Now that we
may the better perceive how the Romans had weakened, and almost utterly rooted
out the Jewish Nation: we will relate some of their particular massacres: which
were not more cruelly inflicted on them by their enemies, then justly deserved
by themselves: they wishing (though, I suppose, not desiring) that the innocent
blood of our Savior should be on them and their children. First then the
inhabitants of Caesarea slew of the Jews in one day, about 20000: and such as
fled were took and imprisoned by Florus the Lieutenant of Judea. To revenge
this slaughter of the Jews, set upon the Syrians; in which skirmish 13000 of
them were slain: The people of Alexandria put 50000 of them to the sword: they
of Damascus 10000. Antonius a Roman Captain, slew in Ascalon 10000 of them; and
Cestius an other Captain, 8040 persons. Now to come to the wars here managed
by Vespasian: This Vespasian in the siege of Aphaca, slew and took prisoners
17130 persons; in Samaria 11600 persons; in Iosopata 42200 persons; in Ioppa so
many killed and drowned themselves, that the Sea threw up again 4200 dead
bodies, and the rest so totally perished, that there remained none to carry
tidings unto Jerusalem of the loss of the town. In the city of Tarichea were
slain and made captives 45000 persons, besides those which were given to the
king Agrippa. In Gamala there perished 90000, and none left alive but only two
women. In Gascala 5000 men died by the sword In the city of Gadara there were
slain 32200, besides an infinite number of such as had drowned themselves. In
Jerusalem it self there died 1100000 of them, partly by the sword, and partly
by the famine, the worser enemy of the two; there were found 2000 in priuies
and sinkes; and 97000 taken prisoners, insomuch that 30 Jews were sold for a
penny. Now that Jerusalem was able to contain so huge a number of people is
evident, in that when Cestius was Lieftenant of Iewry, the high Priest did at
his request number the people which came thither to eat the Paschall Lamb, and
found them to be two millions and 700000 living souls, all sound and purified.
For to Leapers, or men having a flux of seed, or women in their monthly
terms, or to strangers, it was not lawful to eat it. And when Titus laid
siege to the City, it was in the Feast of the Passover, when most of the
people were there assembled, God (as it were) thus imprisoning them. All these
massacres, besides diverse others which I have omitted, and infinite numbers
which were slain in the fields and villages, which drowned themselves, and
which were privately made away, amounting in all to almost two millions of
people, happened in the compass of four years, beginning at the 12th of Nero,
and ending at the second of Vespasian: Yet was not the whole Nation rooted out,
till the year 136; for then this miserable people having stirred two notable
rebellions; the one under Traian, and the last under Adrian the Emperors, were
generally banished their native country, and never again permitted to inhabit
it, otherwise the^ as strangers. After this desolation, the Jews were
dispersed all over the World, and especially in Spain, where Adrian commanded
many of them to dwell: yet they found euery-where so little favor, that having
diverse times bin put to grievous mulcts and ransomes, they are at last even
quite thrust out of Europe also. They were banished out of England by Edward
the first, Anno 1290: Out of France by Philip the fair, 1307; Out of Spain by
Ferdinand the Catholic, 1492: Out of Portugal by Emanuell 1497: Out of
Naples and Sicily by Charles the fifth, 1539: yet are they found in great
numbers in the Romish parts of Germany and Poland; in most Cities of Italy,
especially Rome, where there are no less then 15000 or 20000 of them, and also
in the Popes Country of Avignion. The reason why they are permitted to live
thus under our holy fa^hers nose, Sands rel.
is forsooth an expectation of their conversion: Which is a mere pretense, the
reason indeed being the benefit hence arising to his Holiness coffers. But the
hopes of their conversion is small, and the means less. For besides the
scandal, datum and acceptum, by the Papists fond worshipping of images so
peremptorily contrary to the first table of the Law; they are not permitted to
see any books of the Christian Religion, no not so much as the New Testament:
and (which works most upon men of their metal) because at their conversion
they must quit all their goods to the Church; as being ill gotten, and so by
consequence the works of the devil, which in their baptism they promise to
renounce. They have also a Synagogue at Amsterdam, and are pretty thick spread
over the Dominions of the Turks; who notwithstanding so hate them for
crucifying of CHRIST, that they use to say in detestation of a thing, I would I
might dye a Jew: Neither will they permit a Jew to turn Turk unless he be
first baptized.

What the revenues of this kingdom have amounted to, since the division of it
under Roboam, I know not. The Word of God specifieth the sum of them in the
days of Solomon, 2 Chr. 9, 13: viz: 666 Talents of Gold (besides his
Custom House) which amounts to two Millions and 997000 pounds a year, a
huge sum for so small a kingdom.

Jerusalem was reedified by Aelius Adrianus, and given to the Christians; from
whom it was taken by Cosroes and the Persians, Anno 615. from them it was
forcibly wrested by Haumar and the Saracens, Anno 637. Next it fell into the
power of Cutlu Moses and the Turks, Anno 1009: under whose oppression when it
had long groaned, Peter the Hermit stirred up the Western Princes to relieve
the distressed Christians; whose designs obtained their wished effect, under
the banners of that victorious Prince Godfrey of Bullen, Anno 1099. This
Godfrey for his merits, was to have bin invested with the royal wreath of
Majesty; which he denied, thinking it unmeet to wear a Crown of Gold, where
his Savior had worn a crown of Thorns.

The Christian Kings of Palestine.
1099 1 Godfrey of Bullen. 1100 2 Baldwin 18 1118 3 Baldwin II. de Bourg. 15
1133 4 Milliscent 9 1133 4 Fulke Earl of Aniou 9 1142 5 Baldwin III 21 1163 6
Almexie 10 1173 7 Baldwin IV. 12 1185 8 Baldwin V. 1185 9 Guie of Lysingham,
the last king of Jerusalem; during whose time Saladine the Sultan of Egypt won
the kingdom, Ano 1187: which his successors defended against all invasions,
till the year 1517, in which Selimus the first, Emperor of the Turks, added
the Holy land, together with Egypt, to his Empire. When Jerusalem was taken by
the Christians, the German Emperors name was Fridericus; the Popes Vrbanus,
the Hierosolymitan Patriarchs Heraclius, and so also were they called when the
Christians again lost it. This is the conceit of Roger Houonden, in the life of
Henry the second: but how it can agree with Chronology, I see not.
After the taking of Jerusalem by Sultan Saladine, the Christians retired
their forces into some of the other towns of the Holy land, which they made
good against the Enemy; and defended them under the government of these three
kings following, viz: 10 Conrade M. of Montferrat. 11 Henry E. of Champaigne.
12 John di Brenn; the last Christian king that ever had possessions in Syria,
or Palestine. Yoland the daughter of this John di Breenn, was wife to
Frederick King of Naples, who in her right entitled himself king of
Jerusalem, and so now do the Kings of Spain; as heirs unto, and possessers
of the kingdom of Naples. Concerning this title, it would not be amiss to
insert this story. When the late wars were hot between England and Spain,
there were Commissioners of both sides appointed to treat of peace. They met at
a Town of the French kings, and first it was debated what tongue the
negotiation should be handled in. A Spaniard thinking to give the English
Commissioners a shrewd gird, proposed the French tongue as most fit; it being a
language which the Spaniards were well skilled in; and for these gentlemen of
England, I suppose (said he) that they cannot be ignorant of the language of
their fellow-subiects: Their Queen is Queen of France as well as England. Nay
infaith my Masters, replied Dr Dale, (the master of the requests:) the French
tongue is too vulgar for a business of this secrecy and importance,
especially in a French Town. We will rather treat in Hebrew, the language of
Jerusalem, whereof your Master is king; and I suppose we are therein as well
skilled as you in the French. And thus much for this title.


Bara.
The Arms of the Christian kings in Jerusalem was Luna, a cross crosset
crossed, Sol, which was commonly called the cross of Jerusalem.

After the recovery of the Holy land from the Turk, these 3 orders of
knighthood were instituted, Grimston.
viz: 1 Of the Sepulcher, instituted by Queen Helena, the Mother of Constantine
the Great. They were bound to defend the blessed Sepulcher, to war against
the Infidels, and to defend Pilgrims. 2 Of St John of Jerusalem begun by one
Gerard, not long after Godfrey of Bullen, Ano 1124, and confirmed by Pope
Gelasius the second. The roabe is a white Cross of 8 points, their duty is to
defend the Holy land, relieve Pilgrims, and succor Christian Princes against
the Infidels, they were to be of noble extraction. They grew in time to be
infinite rich, especially after the Templars were suppressed; most of whose
possessions were transferred unto this order: Stow in the surv. of London.
insomuch that they had at one time in Christendom no fewer then 20000
Lordships; and in England the Prior of their order was accounted the prime
Baron of the Realm. But now their intrado is not a little diminished by the
withdrawing of the Kings of England, and other Protestant Princes from the
Church of Rome. We have spoken of these Knights already, when we were in Malta:
now I will only tell you, that their first Master was Foulke of Villaret; the
last that had his residence in Jerusalem, Peter of Aste, in whose time they
being expelled Palestine, seized on Rhodes, are now seated in Malta, the
present Master being Aloph of Vignacourt. 3 Of the Templers, instituted by Hugh
of Payennes, Ao 1113, and confirmed by Pope Eugenius. Their ensign was red
cross, in token that they should shed their blood to defend CHRIST'S Temple.
They were buried crosse-legged, and wore on their backs the figure of the
Cross; for which they were by the common people called Crossebacke, or
Crouch-back, and by corruption* Crook-backe. Edmund Earl of Lancaster, second
son to our Henry the third, being of this order, was vulgarly called Edmund
Crookebacke; which gave Henry the 4th a foolish occasion to ^aigne, that this
Edmund (from whom he was descended) was indeed the eldest son of King Henry:
but for his crookednes and deformity, his younger brother was preferred to the
Crown before him. These Knights had in all Provinces of Europe their
subordinate governors, in which they did possess no less then 16000
Lordships: the greatness of which revenue was not the least cause of dissoluing
the Order. For Philip the fair, King of France, had a plot to invest one of
his sons with the title of King of Jerusalem, and did procure of the Pope the
revenue of this Order: which he might the better do, because Clement the 5th
then Pope, for the love he bare to France, had transferred his seat from Rome
to Avignion. But herein his hopes deceived him; for this Order being
dissolved, the lands thereto belonging were given to the Knights Hospitalers,
or of S. John. The crimes proved against this Order was 1 their revolt from
their professed obedience unto the Patriarch of Jerusalem who w^^ their
visitor. Secondly, their unspeakable p^ide; and thirdly their sins against
nature. The house of our Law-students in London, called the Temple, was the
chiefhouse of the Knights of this Order in England; and was by the Knights of
S. John, whose principal mansion was in Smithfield, sold unto the Students of
the Laws, for the yearly rent of 10l; about the middle of the reign of
Edward the third.


These three orders M. Seldom (and deservedly) puts not in his Titles of
Honor, in that they were prohibited to kiss a woman; honourarie knighthood,
and the love of Ladies, going together like virtue and reward.

Thus much of Syria and Palestine.

OF ARMENIA.
ARMENIA has on the East, Media and the Caspian sea; on the West, Maginus.
Euphrates and the Euxine sea; on the North, Tartary; on the South,
Mesopotamia. But before we descend to the particulars of this Country, it is
necessary we should take a survay of those mountains, which lying East of
Euphrates, part this Country from Anatolia. Knolles.
These mountains are reputed to be those parts of the hills Taurus, and
Anti-taurus; which are called Periadres, Scodrisci, and Amamus. The people here
inhabiting, are more famous for nothing then their want of all things, stout,
cruel, and warlike; maintaining themselves by hunting and stealing: as men
living in so barren a soil, that husbandry were vain and fruitless. They have
among them many beggarly villages, and few towns, the chief whereof is Maras,
once the seat of their Kings; the people for the most part following the
temperature of the Air, and the favorable aspect of the Sun, in their
remooues and dwellings. Their last king was Aladeules, whom the Turkish
histories (who make frequent mention of him) call the mountain king. He was a
man who shrewdly molested Bajazet the second, in his conquest of Carmania; and
Selmus the first in his wars against Persia; and having for many years
molested, and impeached the victories of the one and the other; he was by
Selimus taken and slain: and his kingdom being made a Turkish Province, these
mountains and their passages became subject, and open to that Nation, Anno
1515.

The Armenians are generally good Archers, merry, careless of honor, desiring
ease, great bodied, comely, and willing to be soothed. The women tall, but
homely, kind to their children, poor and incontinent; accounting it a great
credit to them, if they can please and become acceptable to such guests, as
their husbands bring into the house: and most of the Virgins becoming mothers
at ten years old; and bearing about in their arms, the witnesses of their
abilities in that kind. Swearing is had in great respect with both, and such as
cannot pick and steal, are deemed block-heads and sheep-biters.

The whole Country is divided into three Provinces. 1 Colchis. 2. Georgia. 3
Turcomania.

COLCHIS lies on the Euxine Sea, toward the North and East; Brerewood.
the people hereof received the Christian Faith by Matthias; and now differ
from other Christians their neighbors, in three circumstances only; viz: 1 in
not baptising their children till the eighth year: 2ly in not entering into the
Churches til the 60th year; but hearing divine service, standing without the
Temple: and 3ly in dedicating their youth to theft and rapine; their old age to
the difficult work of repentance; They are under the jurisdiction of the
Patriarch of Constantinople.

In this Country reigned Aetas, from whom Jason stole the Golden Fleece, by the
aid and sorceries of Medea. This Country is now called Mengrelia: the chief
towns whereof are 1 Aluati, and 2 Fassum on the banks of Phasis, 3 Dioscurias,
where there were 300 several languages spoken, because of the abundance of
Merchants of all kingdoms: so that the Romans kept here continually 30
Interpreters, to mediat between the people and the Governor.

2 GEORGIA has not its name from S. George, whom here they greatly reverence;
but from the Georgi, who long before that time inhabited the adjacent
Countries. It is bounded on the East with Media, on the West with Colchis; on
the North with Albania, or Swiria; and on the South with the greater Armenia,
or Turcomania: so that it lies just between the Euxine and the Caspian seas.
The people are good soldiers, and received the Gospel in the time of
Constantine the Great, on an occasion related by Socrates Scholasticus, indeed
very miraculous, and (I doubt) unworthy credit, and therefore I omit it. At
this day they consent in most doctrinall points with the Grecians, only they
acknowledge not the Patriarch of Constantinople, but have a Patriarch of their
own, who is for the most part resident in his house on Mount Sinay in
Palestine, and has under his jurisdiction 18 Bishops.

This Province was formerly called Iberia; the chief towns being 1 Lori, 2
Bascapan, 3 Testis, exceeding strongly fortified by the Turks, to defend their
new conquests from the Persians; and 4 Tomanis. Out of this Region, the
Egyptian Sultans used to choose their Soldiers or Mamaluskes, who at last grew
so powerful, that they assumed to themselves the kingdom of Egypt; which they
long time valorously defended.

TVRCOMANIA is seated in the midst between Colchis and Iberia. The chief
Towns are Albanopolis, where S. Bartholomew was buried. 2 Van, which both by
its natural seat, and artificial fortresses, is a strong bulwark against the
Persian invasions. 3 Arminig the Metropolis of the Country at this time. 4
Trigranocerta, built by Tigranes, one of the most mighty Kings that ever ruled
in this Country, as having added Media, Syria, and Parthia, to his own
Dominions. This Prince married the daughter of Mithridates K. of Pontus, and
aided him against the Romans: but with what success, we have already told you
in Syria. As for his new city Tigrano certa, it was by Lucullus the Roman
General, besieged and taken; wherein besides other riches was found 3000
talents in ready money. 5 Artaxata, once the chief city of Armenia, so called,
either because it was seated on the river Araxis; or from Artaxes a progenitour
of Tigranes, who was the Founder of it. It is now called Coy, and was in the
middle age named Esechia. Famous it is for two notable bat^ailes fought by it;
the first between Lucullus and his Romans on the one side; against Mithridates
and Tigranes on the other: wherein the Romans were victors: the second, between
Selimus Emperor of the Turks, and Hismael the Persian Sophie, wherein the
Turks were Conquerours, Knolles.
Anno 1514. A victory which he bought with the loss of 30000 of his best men,
and such a terror to the whole Army; that the Turks to this day call it, the
only day of doom. The fields adjoining to the town wherein this cruel
battle was fought, are called the Chaldean fields. 6 Sebastia, the residence
of the Patriarch of the Armenians, who differ from their neighbor Christians,
in receiving infants to the Lords Table, immediately after Baptism: secondly,
in abstaining from unclean beasts: thirdly, in fasting on Christmasse day: and
fourthly, in holding their children over the fire, as a necessary circumstance
in Baptism, because John the Baptist told the people which followed him, that
CHRIST should baptize them with the spirit, and with fire; in which place he
means not material fire, but the lively purgation of the Holy Ghost,
according to the nature of fire. The Church of this sect is governed by two
Patriarchs, whereof the one has under his jurisdiction this Turcomania,
comprehending 150000 Families, besides very many Monasteries: and the other
has under him the two Provinces of Armenia the lesser, and Cilicia,
comprehending 20000 Families or thereabouts.

This Country being formerly, and properly called Armenia the greater, to
distinguish it from a lesser of the same name in Anatolia, is now vulgarly
called Turcomania; which name it deriueth from the Turks, who being a people
of Scythia, and too populous to be sustained with sufficient food in so barren
a Country; broke through the Caspian straight, and seated themselves here in
the year 844. Here they lived an obscure life, neither known nor regarded,
till such time as Mahomet a Saracenicall Sultan of Persia, having imbarqued
himself in a needless war against the Caliph of Babylon, (which war he
could neithet finish with sa^ety, nor remit without loss of reputation) hired
those Turks to strengthen his part against the Caliph, by whose multitude and
valor, he got a noble victory of his enemy. Perceiving now how necessary it
was to hinder their return homeward, he stops all the passages toward
Armenia, intending to use the Turks (as they do now their Asaph) to blunt the
sword of the enemy. This treacherous dealing of Mahomet, could not but stir
up a fury in the enraged multitude; who presently arm themselves, and by the
fortunate conduct of Tangrolipix, gave the Persians such an overthrow; that
they lost, and the Turks won, he Persian kingdom, Anno 1030.

Thus was Tangrolipix inthronized in the Persian chair of Estate, which he not
long after left to his son Axan; against whom Cutlu Moses stirred up some
unnatural commotions: which seeming prejudicial to their new seated Monarchy,
were strangled in their cradle, and Cutlu Moses was sent with an army, to
conquer what he could from the Christian Emperors; the report of whose
approach, made all Asia to tremble, and many of her Provinces, to submit
themselves to his vict^rious troops.

The Turkish Kings in Lesser Asia.
1 Cutlu Moses, cousin to Tangrolipix, the first Turkish Sultan in Persia;
won Media, part of Armenia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Bythinia. 2 Solomon, against
whom Godfrey of Bullen first tried his soldiers. 3 Mahomet. 4 Musat, Sultan of
Iconium, subdued Mahomet the son of Solomon, and died possessed of all the
Turkish Provinces in Lesser Asia. 5 Calisastlan, wrested from his brother
Iaqupasan, Amasia and Ancyra; from Dodune, Sebastia and Cesarea. He overthrew
Emmanuell Comnenus, and united Phrygia to his Dominions. 6 Rencratine
dispossessed his brothers Masut Cappatine, and Cailhosroes of their
inheritance: Toward the latter end of his reign, the Tartarian Cham Heccata,
had driven the Turks out of Persia, where there flourished two especial
Families: the Zelzuccian Tribe, from whence descended the Persian Sultans, as
also the Aladine Kings in Asia: the Oguzian, of whom in their due place.
The Aladine Kings in Lesser Asia.
1 Aladine descended in the first line from Cussanes the last Turkish Sultan of
Persia, with many of his Nation, seated himself in Cilicia; which he had taken
from the Gre^ians: making first Sebastia, and after Iconium, the place of his
residence. 2 Azaline. 3 Iathatine* slain by Theodorus Lascaris. 4 Iathatine II,
driven out of his kingdom by the victorious Tartars, and died in exile. 5
Masut and Cricubades, were by the Tartarian Emperor placed in the Throne, as
his tributary Princes. 6 Aladine was the last of the Zelzuccian Family in Asia;
after whose death, and the departure of the tyrannizing Tartars; the more
powerful Captains divided the Lesser Asia between themselves.
The Zelzuccian Family in Palestine.
As Axan successor to Tangrolipix, furthered the conquest of Cutlu Moses
against the Christians; so he employed Melech and Ducat, two of his kinsmen,
against the Saracens; from whom they quickly conquered Syria and the Holy land,
not long after recovered by the Princes of the West; against whom the Sultans
of Damascus opposed themselves diverse times to their detriment. It fortuned at
last that Almericus King of Jerusalem, made war with the Caliph of Egypt, who
unable to resist him, implored aid of Noradin King of Damascus. He sent unto
his succor, Sarracon a fortunate Captain; who not only repelled the force of
the Christians, but subdued the kingdom to himself. His successor Saladine
also recovered the Holy land: but after his death, Palestine was lost to the
Tartars; and Egypt to the Mamaluckes, who not long after regained Jerusalem.
And thus ended the Zelzuccian Tribe in all the Turkish Dominions.

The Oguzian Family, or line of Ottoman.
Solomon the chief of the Oguzian Family, and Prince of Machan, flying the fury
of the Tartars, was drowned in Euphrates; leaving the guiding of his wandering
subjects to his son Etrogul; who obtained of the last Aladine, the village
Sagutae in Bythinia, for himself and his handful of subjects. To him
succeeded his son Ottoman, Anno 1280, who to revenge some injuries done to his
people by the improuident Christians, took from them the City Nice; and took
upon him the title of Sultan, after the death of Aladine, in the year 1300. To
this time, and to these small beginnings must we reduce the Ottoman Empire.

1300 1 Ottoman the first Turkish Sultan of this Tribe, united to his Lordship
of Saguta, Bythinia, Cappadocia, and part of Pontus. 28 1328 2 Orchanes took
the City Prusa, and made it his residence; and was the first that put footing
in Europe. 22 1350 Amurath won the Thracian Chersonesiu, the strong City
Adrianople, Servia, Bulgaria, and Misia, where he was slain by a common
Soldier. 23 1373 4 Bajazet made himself master of a great part of Thrace,
Macedon, and Phocis. He was taken by Tamberlaine, and brained himself in an
iron cage, in which the insolent Conqueror used to carry him. 26 1399 5
Mahomet united the dismembered Empire of his father, and enlarged it with Dacia,
part of Sclavonia, and the rest of Macedon. 17 1416 6 Amurath II, subdued from
the Constantinopolitan Empire, all Achaia, Thessaly, Epirus, and died before
the walls of Croia, 34
The Ottoman Emperors.
1450 7 Mahomet II, surnamed the Great, and first Emperor of the Turks,
ruined the two Empires of Constantinople and Trabezond, 12 kingdoms, and 200
Cities. 34 1481 8 Bajazet II, subdued the Caramanian kingdom, part of Armenia,
and drove the Venetians from Moreah, and their part of Dalmatia, 31 1512 9
Selimus having poisoned his Father; subverted the Mamaluckes of Egypt, bringing
it together with Palestine, Syria, and Arabia, under his yoke. 7 1519 10
Solomon the magnificent, surprised Rhodes, Belgrad, Buda; with a great part of
Hungary, Babylon, Assyria, Mesopotomia. 48 1567 11 Selimus II, an idle and
effeminate Emperor, by his Deputies took from the Venetians, the I Will of
Cyprus; and from the Moors the kingdom of Tunis, and Algiers. 8 1575 12
Amurath III took from the disagreeing Persians, Armenia, Media, and the City
Tau^is, and the Fort Guierino from the Hungarians 20 1595 13 Mahomet III took
Agria in Hungary, which Kigdome had likely bin lost, if he had pursued his
victory. 8 1603 14 Achmat, who the better to enjoy his pleasures, made peace
with the German Emperor, and added nothing to his Empire. 15 1618 15 Mustapha,
brother to Achmet, succeeded; a novelty never before heard of in this kingdom,
it being the common policy to strangle all the younger brothers; howsoever this
Mustapha was preserved, either because Achmet being once a younger brother, took
pity on him: or because he had no issue of his body, and so was not permitted
to kill him. 1618 16 Osman succeeded his Uncle Mustapha; but being by the
Ianisaries slain in an vproare, Must^pha was again restored: yet long inioyed
he not his Throne; for the same hand that raised him, plucked him down, and
seated young Amurath in the place. 1623 17 Amurath IV, brother to Osman, now
reigns.
By these Princes has that Monarchy bin built, which in Europe contains all
Dacia, Graecia, all the Aegaean Isles, and the Taurica Chersonesus: in Asia, the
Provinces already described, Arabia, Assyria, Media, Mesopotamia, Rhodes,
Cyprus, and other small Ilands`; and in Afric, Egypt, and the kingdoms of
Tunis and Algiers. Nor is this their title any thing short of so vast an
Empire; for this Solomon styles himself in a letter to Villerius, great Master
of the Rhodes; at such time as he intended to invade that Island. Solomon king
of kings, Lord of Lords, most high Emperor of Constantinople and Trabezond,
the most mighty King of Persia, Syria, Arabia, and the Holy land; Lord of
Europe, Asia, Africa, Prince of Mecha, and Aleppo, ruler of Jerusalem, and
sovereign Lord of the Universal Sea, and all the Islands therein, etc.

The Turks are generally well complexioned, of good stature, proportionably
compacted, no idle talkers, no doers of things superfluous, hot and venerious,
servile to their Emperor, and zealous in religion. They nourish no hair on
their head, and therefore keep on of all sides, counting it an opprobrious
thing to see any uncover their head, and use to say when they dislike any thing
which they have seen or heard. I had as liefe thou had shown me thy bare
skull. In their familiar salutations they lay their hands on their bosoms, and
a little decline their bodies: but when they accost a person of rank, they bow
almost to the ground, and kiss the hem of his garment. Walking up and down
they never use, and much wonder at the often walking of Christians. Biddulph
relates, that being at his ambulatory exercise with his companions; a Turk
demanded them whether they were out of their way, or their wits? If your way
(quoth the Turk) lay toward the upper end of the Cloister, why come you
downwards: if to the nether end, why go you back again. Shooting is their
chief recreation, which they also follow with much laziness, sitting on
carpets in the shadow, and sending some of their slaves for their arrows.
They prefer, as they pass the streets, the left hand before the right; as
being thereby made master of his sword with whom they walk. As they shave
their heads, so they wear their beards long, a sign of freedom; but the
^laues keep theirs shaven and close cut.

The women are of small stature, for the most part ruddy, clear, and smooth as
the pollished Iuory; as never ruffled with the weather, and often frequenting
the Baths: of a very good complexion, seldom going abroad, and then masked:
lascivious within doors, pleasing in matters of incontinency, and they are
accounted most beautiful, which have the greatest eyes, and are of the
blackest hue. Every Turk is permitted to have fou^e wives, and as many slaves
as he is able to keep: yet are they to meddle with none but their own; the
offending woman being drowned, and the man dismembered. These women live in
great awe and respect of their husband, never sitting with him at the table,
but waiting till he has done, and then withdrawing into some by-roome. If
their husband have bin abroad, at his coming in they all rise from the stools
whereon they sat, kiss his hand, make their obeisance, and stand as long as
he is in presence. The children which they have, they carry not in their arms
as we do, but astride on their shoulders. They live immured from the sight of
the world, and permit not any male children, no not their own sons, to come
amongst them after they are 12 years old. From their husbands they cannot be
divorced but on special occasion: but their husbands may put away them, or
give them to their slaves, when, and as often as they list. Far better is it
with the sisters, or the daughters of the Sultan, to whom, when her father or
brother bestows her on any of the Bassa's, he gives her a dagger, saying, I
give thee this man to be thy slave and bedfellow, if he be not loving,
obedient, and du^i^ull unto thee, I give thee here this Canzhare or dagger to
cut off his head. When they are married, their husbands come not to bed unto
them until they are sent for, and then also they creep in at the beds feet.
That ever any of these Ladies made use of their dagger I could never read: only
I find that Lutzis Bassa the chief man in the whole Empire next the Sultan
himself, and of him very much beloved, having given his wife which was sister
to Solomon the magnificent, a box on the ear; was upon complaint by her made,
thrust from all his honors, banished into Macedon, and had doubtlesly been
slain, if the Emperors love, and his own merits had not pleaded for him. And
this is all the prerogative of a Sultans daughter, her sons being accounted
as mere and ordinary Turks only, and never being preferred above the rank of
a common or inferior Captain.

The better sort of the Turks use the Sclauonian tongue, the vulgar speak the
Turkish language; which being originally the Tartarian, borrows from the
Persian, their words of state; from the Arabicke, their words of religion; from
the Grecians, their words and terms of war; and from the Italians, their
terms of navigations.

They were formerly Idolatrous Pagans, and were first initiated in
Mahumetanisme* when they got the Sovereignty of the Persian Scepter. The
degrees in their religion are 1 the Sassi or Nouices: 2 The Calsi or readers: 3
The Hogi or writers of books; for printing they use not: 4 The Na^pi or young
Doctors: 5 the Caddi, whereof there is at least one in every City to judge of
offenses. 6 The Mudressi, who use to ouersee the Caddis. 7 The Mulli, or
principal Church governor under the Mufti. 8 The Cadulescais, whereof there
are only three; one for Greece, the other for Anatolia, the third for Egypt and
Syria; these sit with the Bassa's in the Diuano, to determine of temporal
suits. 9 The Mufti, whose sentence in law and religion is unaccountable; he
abaseth not himself to sit in the Diuano, nor affords more reverence to the
Emperor, then he to him.

His forces are either for the Sea or the Land. His Sea forces are great in
regard of his spacious sea coasts; vast woods, and number of subjects: he never
suffered above one defeat, and that at Lepanto; yet the next year he showed
his Navy whole and entire. Galleys are his only vessels, which being unable to
cope with ships of any bigness, were not only the occasion of that overthrow;
but also have heartned the Florentine, only with 6 great ships of war to
swagger in the Seas; so that for more safety, the tribute of Egypt is of late
sent to Constantinople by land. The Captain Bassa, or Admiral notwithstanding
with a Navy of 60 sail, makes a progress about the Seas and Sea-Townes, to
annoy the enemy, suppress Pirates, collect the tributes, and to redress the
abuses committed in the maritine Town^s belonging unto the Admiralty: which
annual circuit is begun in May and ended in October.

Their landforces are either horse or foot. They which serve on horseback, are
the Spahi and Asapi: these latter serving to weary the enemies, and dull their
swords with their multitudes of whose bodies the Ianizaries use to make mounts
whereon to assault the walls of a besieged Town; and are by them so contemned,
that a Ianizarie once sold two of them for a sheepes-head. As for the Spahi,
they till they are enrolled into pay, are of the same original and education
with the Ianizaries; and called by the same name Azamoglans. Their pay is 10
Aspers a day* The Turk is able, and does maintain 150000 Horse at little or
no cost; which no other Prince can do with 14 Millions of Gold: for
wheresoever any parcel of land is conquered, it is divided into diverse parts,
and committed to the manuring of diverse men whom they call Timariots. These are
to pay unto the Emperor certain rents, and at their own charges to send to
his wars so many horse, excellently appointed for the field: and which is the
chief point of their service, to keep the subjects in all parts of his Empire
in awe; for being as they are dispersed in all quarters of his dominions, the
people can no sooner stir, but these will be assembled and be upon them.
These Timariots are in all accounted to amount to 719000 fighting men; whereof
257000 have their abode in Europe; 462000 in Asia and Africa. Were it not for
these Timariots, as the Turks saying is, no grass would grow where the Grand
Signeurs horse has once set his hoof: for if the care of manuring the ground
were committed to the peasants, and not to military men; the greatest part of
the ground in this Empire would grow wast and desolate. These Timariots were
instituted by Othoman the first Turkish King of this family; and a curse by him
laid on them that should annihilate the institution. The name is derived from
the Turkish word Timar, signifying a stipend.

But the nerves and sinews of this warlike body are the Ianizaries, who by
original being Christians, are chosen by the Turkish officers every five
years, out of his Europaean dominions: and so distributed abroad to learn the
language, customs and religion of the Turks: afterward according to their
strength, will, or disposition, placed in diverse chambers. They of the first
Chamber, are preferred some to be Chiausies, such as go on Embassies, and
execute judgments: others to be Sansiaks, or Governors of Cities, some to
be Bassa's, or commanders of Horsemen, and others to be Beglerbigs (id^est,
Lord of Lords) to command the rest in general. They of the other Chambers are
the Ianizaries, or Praetorian Soldiers of his Guard, to whose faith and trust
the care of the Emperors person is committed. ^he tithing of these young
spring alls is, as we have said every fifth year, and oftener sometimes as his
occasions serve. By which means he not only disarmeth his own subjects, and
keeps them from attempting any stir or innovation in his Empire: but
spoileth also the Provinces he most fears of the flower, sinews, and
strength of their people; choice being made of the strongest youths only, and
fittest for war. These, before they are enrolled in pay, are called
Azamoglans, and behave themselves with much submissenesse toward their Seniours
and Governors: but when once they are honored with the title of Ianizaries,
they grow by degrees into an intolerable pride and haughtiness, Till of late,
they were not permitted to marry; neither now can any of their sons be
accounted any other the^ a natural Turk (whom of all people they account the
basest) the eldest only excepted; to whom this prerogative was granted by
Amurath the 3d when he came to the Crown. They are in number 40000, of which
16000 are always resident in Constantinople. In this City they are diversely
employed, being as Constables to see the peace kept; as Clarks of the market to
see to the weights and measures; as Officers to arrest common offenders; as
Warders to look to the gates; to guard the houses of Ambassadors; and to
travel with strangers for their more safety; in which charge they are very
faithful. Their pay is but five Aspers a day, and two gowns yearly; neither
are their hopes great, the command of 10, 20, or 100 men being their greatest
preferment: yet are they very obsequious to their captain or Aga; who is in
authority inferior to the meanest Bassa, though in power perhaps above the
chiefest. For the crafty Turks join not power and authority together and if
they observe the Ianizaries to love and respect their Aga too much, they
quickly deprive him of life and office. The founder of this order was Amurath
the first, Ano. 1365; their greatest establisher Amurath the 2d; their name
signifies young Soldiers. Now concerning these Ianizaries, we will farther
consider the sway they bear in designing the successor: 2ly their insolency
toward their Emperors and his Officers. 3ly Their behavior in the vacancy of
the throne: and 4ly their punishments.

1 Concerning the first, I never find any particular sway the Iauizaries
carried in the designation of their Emperor, till the death of Mahomet the
great; when the Bassa's having chosen Corcut the son of Bajazet, were
ouerruled by the Aga and his Ianizaries, who more inclined to Bajazet his
father, and son to Mahomet. Though I am not ignorant, that when this Mahomet
succeeded in the Throne; the joyful acclamations made by these Soldiers, were
accounted the chiefest sign of his secure and perpetuated establishment. But
the chief instance of their power herein, was the inthronizing of Selimus; who
being but the 7th son to this Bajazet, was not only preferred by the^ before
his brethren in his fathers life time; but by their aids also he severally
mastered them, and in the end poisoned his father. To omit other examples, even
the last year Anno 1622, they slew the young Emperor Osmen, drew the now
Sultan out of prison, and established him in the royalty. 2 As for the next,
the first example in which I find them peccant toward their Prince, was at the
beginning of the reign of the above mentioned Bajazet; when hearing of the
intended death of Achmetes Bassa whom they loved, they brake open the Court
gates, and told the Emperor, they would teach him like a drunkard, a beast,
and a rascal as he was; to use his great place and calling with more sobriety
and discretion. Not long after conceauing farther displeasure against the said
Bajazet, they shook their weapons against him, and refused to take him in the
midst among them; and were not, without great and vile submission on his part,
appeased. Against Selimus the first they also mutined, when being resolved to
winter in Armenia, for the better pursuit of his victories toward the Persian;
he was by them forced to return home unto Constantinople. Against Solomon they
mutined so violently, that they compelled him to displace Rustan his chief
Bassa and favorite. Against Amurath the 3d, for placing over them a new Aga,
they so strongly opposed themselves; that first they set fire on
Constantinople, and burnt therein, besides shops and warehouses, 25 great
Innes, 7 Temples, and 15000 houses: and in the end constrained him to give them
money; and to yield also into their hands two of his chief Counselors, by
them supposed to be their adversaries; whom they drew about the streets.
Finally (to omit the late tumult 1622 abouenamed) in the year 1600, they grew
so disco^ented with Amurath the 3d, that they not only threatened to destroy the
principal officers of the Court, and the banishment of the Sultanesse his
mother, but the deposing of himself also. 3 Now for the third. I find it to
have been the custom of these Ianizaries, between the death of an old
Emperor, and the beginning of the new; to commit diverse enormities: as the
rifling of the houses of the Jews, and Christians, among whom they dwelt; the
murdering of the Bassa's, and principal men about the Court, whom they
suspected not to have favored them; and a number of the like outrageous
insolences; for of these we find frequent mention: as after the death of
Amurath the 2d, and Mahomet the great, this last time the Merchants of
Constantinople being natural Turks, escaped not their ravenous hands, neither
could Mahomet Bassa avoid the fury of their swords. This spoil they took for
so certain a due, that if they were disappointed of it, they would presently
raise commotions both in Court, Field, and City; unless some present
satisfaction were made them. To this end Achmat distributed among them 2
Millions and a half of Ducats: Selimus the first two Millions; others made an
increase of their daily pay. But Selimus the 2d distributing among them 100000
Sultanies only, was by them prohibited to enter into his Seraglio, till he had
enlarged his bounty; and the great Bassa's were wrapped about the pate with
their Calliuers, for persuading them to quietness. Now to prevent the dangerous
and factious liberty, which in the vacancy of the Empire was usually committed;
the death of the old Emperor was with all secrecy concealed, till the arrival
of the new. To omit others, I will instance in the deaths of Mahomet the first,
and Solomon only. This Solomon died at the siege of Sigeth in Hungary, which
was so cunningly concealed by Mahomet Bassa the space of 20 days: that before
the Ianizaries knew of it, his son Selimus had possessed himself of
Constantinople, and came also to their army then in retreit homeward. For this
Mahomet privately strangled the Physicians and Apothecaries which knew of his
death; commanded the Soldiers to go on in their siege; and diverse times
showed them their Emperor sitting in his horse-litter, as (being troubled with
the Gout) he used to do; and when the City was taken, marched homeward with
his dead body sitting still in the same manner. So after the death of Mahomet,
the Bassa's of the court called their Diuanos as formerly they used; gave order
for the leuying of an Army, as if some war were intended: and the Kings
Physicians went up and down with their potions, as if they had him still in
cure. But the Pensioners and Ianizaries misdoubting the matter, with all
eagerness desired to see him: which when the Bassa's durst not deny, they
appointed the next day for their visitation. The next day the dead body was
apparelled in royal large roabs, placed in a chair at the end of a long
Gallery, and a little boy cunningly placed behind him, to move the Kings hand
to his head, as if he should stroke his beard, as his manner was: which signs
of life and strength, the Soldiers seeing, held themselves contented, and so
was his death concealed the space of 41 days. 4 As for the last. These
insolent and insufferable pranks committed so commonly by these masterfull
slaves, so exceedingly stomached Bajazet the 2d, that he secretly purposed with
himself, for curing so dangerous a disease, to use, a desperate remedy: which
was to kill and destroy suddenly all the Ianizaries. It is like that this
Bajazet being a Scholar, had read how Constantine the great had ca^^ed the
Praetorian Soldiers, and destroy their Camp, as men that were the causes of
all the stirs in his Empire, and whose pride was come to an intolerable
height: and having the same cause to destroy his Ianizaries, hoped to produce
on them the same effect. But they having notice of the plot, for the time
continued so united and linked together, that he durst not then attempt it; and
they afterward siding with his some Se^imus, cast him out of his throne into
his grave. Since which time the Emperors never durst punish them openly, but
when any of them proves delinquent, he is sent privily in the night to Pera;
where by the way he is drowned, and a piece of Ordinance shot off, to signify
the performing of the Sultans command.
Now for the Emperors themselves, we will consider them in matters of
pleasure; in matters of ceremony; and in matters of state: these last being
considerable in their three main points, which are the murdering of their
brethren; the remoouing of their sons; their revenue: and therein a touch of
their government. To these we will add what apparent symptoms may be observed
to prognosticate the standing, decreasing, or increasing of this puissant
Monarchy.

1 For the first, he has not so few as 500 (sometimes 1000) choice Virgins,
kept in a Seraglio by themselves; all slaves, born of Christian parents, and
indeed the rarest beauties of his Empire. When he is disposed to take his
pleasure with any of them they are all ranked in a long Gallery, and she is by
the Aga of the women prepared for his bed, to whom he gives his handkercher.
She that bears him the first son is honored with the title of Sultanesse
(Queen mother we may call her) neither can he make any of them free, unless
he marry them. When the Sultan dies, all his women are carried into another
Seraglio, where they are strictly looked to, and liberally provided for, and
not seldom times are bestowed by the succeeding Sultan on his great Bassa's,
and such as he chiefly favors, which is a principal honor. They are
attended on by women only, and Eunuchs, these being not gelded only, but
deprived of all their genitalls, and supplying the uses of nature with a silver
quill; which inhumane custom was brought in among them by Selimus the second,
because he had seen a gelding cover a mare.

2 Their ceremonies are either performed by them, which is for the most part
the building of a Mosche only to help to the salvation of their souls: or
toward them by others, which are most apparent in the entertainment of
Ambassadors. For when such come to his presence, they are led between two of
his Courtiers, and coming before the throne on both sides whereof the Bassa's
sit with admirable silence, resembling rather statua's then men; they bow
themselves to the ground with all humility, laying their hands on their
breasts, but never uncovering their heads, which (as we before noted) is an
indecency. When they are to depart they go all backwards, it being accounted
very irreuerent to turn their back parts toward a Prince so glorious. The
reason why they are thus brought in between two, is said to be for their great
honor; but is indeed a fear they have, lest the grand Signeur under the
pretense of a salutation, or the delivery of an embassy, should be stabbed.
This warines they have used ever since Miles Cobelits a Seruian; who scrambling
from among the slain at the battle of Cassoua, and being admitted to the
speech of Amura^h the first, the author of that overthrow; stabbed him into
the belly with his dagger.

3 Amongst all the iarres and discontents that be, none have been with more
unkindness begun, or more eagerness prosecuted, then those of brothers; not
only in private families, but in the stemmes of Princes: the multitude of
pretendants, being the original of most civil wars. To prevent these
public emotions, the Emperors of Habassia use to immure up all their younger
children in the hill Amara; the Persians to put out the eyes of their younger
brothers; and the Turks to murder them: strange and horrid courses; whereby
to avoid the fear of a war in the state, they stir up a war in their
own bowels. The first that among the Turks began this barbarous cruelty, was
Bajazet the first, on his brother Iacup: whom immediately after his fathers
death, he strangled with a bow-string: this being the ordinary instrument of
their fratricide, because thereby none of the blood-royall of Ottoman is spilt.
After him Mahomet the great caused his young brother then at nurse, to die the
death, and was not without much ado, persuaded from being the executioner
himself. Amurath the 3d caused his five brethren to be at once strangled
before his face; and Mahomet his son, no fewer then 19 in one day. By this
course they imagine their own estate to be infinitely secured, as knowing that
Mustapha a younger son, stirred a rebellion against Amurath, and Zemes
against Bajazet, both the second of those names: that Solomon, Musa, and Isa,
severally afflicted Mahomet; and Corcut, Selimus; the first of these names
also. But yet they will not know, that nothing sooner puts their younger
brothers into these acts of hostility, then an inevitable certainty of a
violent and unnatural death: whereas were they but secure of life, and a
liberal and Princely maintenance, it is more then probable, they would rest
content, as in other kingdoms the younger Princes do. And notwithstanding this
barbarous policy, they are not quite free from fear; as knowing that
counterfeits have heretofore much disturbed the qui^t of their predecessors:
for thus we find Amurath the 2d to have been vexed by one that took upon him
the name of Mustapha, elder brother to Mahomet, the^ ^ate deceased; and much
was he furthered and aided by the ^^eek Princes This has been of the vulgar
policies of Princes, to kindle flames of sedition in their neighbors
Countries. In the infancy of the Roman Empire we find a counterfeit Agrippa,
after that a counterfeit Ne^o, and two counterfeit Alexanders in Syria. But
never was realm so oft^n troubled with these mockings, ^s England; a
counterfeit Richard the 2d, being made in the time of Henry the 4th: a
counterfeit Mortimer, in the time of Henry the 6th: a counterfeit D. of York:
a counterfeit Earl of Warwick, under Henry the seventh: and a counterfeit
Edward the sixth under Q. Mary. To prevent walking spirits, Mahomet the third,
laid out the dead bodies of his father and 19 brethren, as a common spectacle
for all that passed by, or would come to behold them. The present Grand Signeur
Mustapha, miraculously escaped the bowestring twice; first when his brother
Achmat, and secondly when Osmen his young cosen were made Sultans; and is the
first that in this Empire did ever succeed in the collateral line.

4 The removing of the young Princes is done for three reasons: 1 to weane them
from the pleasures of the Court; 2l^ To train them up in arms, and inu^e them
to hardness: and 3ly, and principally, to avoid the danger of a competitour,
whereof old Princes are especially jealous. The common places destinat to this
princely exile, are Amasia in Cappadocia, Magnesia in Caria, and such l^ke
towns of Natolia. Neither do the old Sultans by such a great distance think
themselves secure altogether: but carry a vigilant eye over their sons
actions, and have intelligence of almost every particular thought; the least
suspicion being cause sufficient to destroy them. So we find Mustapha son to
Solomon, the hopefullest branch that ever sprang from the Ottoman tree, to have
been shamefully strangled by the command of his father; upon a rumor only of
a marriage, which he was said to have negotiated with the Persian Kings
daughter. When these Princes are once settled in their governments, it is a
crime meriting no less punishment then death, to depart thence and come unto
Constantinople, before their fathers death, or unless they are by their
fathers sent for. Of this we have a tragical example of Mahomet, a Prince of
great hope son to Bajazet the 2d: who desiring to see the fashion of his
fathers Court, left Magnesia where he was by his father confined; and attended
by two or three Gentlemen came in the habit of a seafaring man to
Constantinople; and having obtained his desire, he returned to his charge. This
strange action being quickly divulged abroad, and by diverse variously
interpreted, stirred such iealousies in the suspicious head of his old father;
that he took order not long after to have him secretly poisoned.

5 As for the ordinary revenue, it consists either in money received, or in
money saved. The money saved is first by the Tartars, of whom he can continually
command 60000 to attend him in his wars without any pay, but the spoil of
the enemy. And 2ly by the Timariots, who nourish and bring into the field more
horses then any Prince in Christendom can keep (as we have already said) for
14 millions of gold. The money received is (according to Boterus) only 15
millions of Sultanies, which is nothing in respect of so great an Empire: the
chief reason where of is the tyrannical government of the Turk, which
dehorteth men from tillage, merchandise, and other improuements of their
estates; as knowing all their gettings to lie in the Grand Signeurs mercy. His
extraordinary reuenew is incredible: for besides that no Ambassador comes
before him empty handed; no man is master of his own wealth farther then
stands with the Emperors liking. So that his great Bassa's are but as spunges,
to suck up riches till their coffers swell, and then to be squeezed into his
treasury. These men as he aduances without envy, so can he destroy without
danger; no man here hoping for partakers if he should resist, as not being
ignorant that one man's fortune is built on the defined overthrow of another.
Such riches as they gain, if they hap to die naturally, return to the
Emperors coffers; who gives only what he pleases to the children of the
deceased. These Bassa's have in their particular Provinces, their Divanos, or
Law courts, where justice has formerly been administered with great integrity,
but now not a little corrupted: yet the comfort is, that such as miscarry in
their right, shall without delays know what to trust to; and the Bassa's upon
complaint to the Emperor, are sure to die for it. Over these Bassa's (the
chief of whom is the Vic^er Bassa, or President of the Council) preside two
Beglerbegs; one for Greece the other for Natolia.

6 Concerning the present state of the Empire, many judge it to be rather in
the wane, then the increase; which judgment they ground upon good reasons;
whereof these are the chief. First that the body is grown too monstrous for
the head, the Sultans never since the death of Solomon accompanying their
armies in person; but rioting and wasting their bodies and treasures at home:
that the Ianizaries who have been accounted the principal strength of this
Empire, are grown more factious in the Court, then valiant in the camp;
corrupted with ease and liberty, drowned in prohibited wines, enseebled with
the continual converse with women, and fallen from their former ancestry of
discipline: that of late they have given no increase to their dominions: and as
in the paths of virtue, non progred^est regredi, so in Empires by violence
gotten, when they cease to be augmented, they begin to be diminished: that
rebellions have in these latter times been in this Empire strangely raised,
and mightily supported; which commotions the former Sultans were never
acquainted with: that the greatness of the Empire is such, that it labors
with nothing more then the waightinesse of it self; so that it must in a
manner needs decline pondere pressa suo, ouerburdened by its own mightiness:
that as in a natural body surfeit kills more then a fasting; so in the body
politic, too much extent sooner ruineth then too little or a mediocrity: that
the sons of the Grand Signeur, whose brauenes of mind is by their father
ever suspected; are (contrary sometimes to their own nature and will) nursed
up in all effeminacy which once rooted in their youth, does always after
assubiect them to the baseness and softnes^e of pleasures: that they have lost
much of that fear and terror, which anciently their very name carried with
it, insomuch that not the Venetians only by Sea have often mated, and once
overthrown him; the Hungarians, have for 200 years withstood his greatest
forces; the Polonians forced him to a dishonorable retreat and composition;
but the poor Prince of Transylvania diverse times did discomf^te him, the
Florentine with 6 Ships only aweth him; and the Emir of Sidon cease not daily
to affront him: that by the avarice and corruption in the Court now reigning,
all peace and war, all counsels and informations, all wrongs and favors are
made saleable: that is more then apparent that their Empire is at the height,
Et quod naturaliter procedere non potest (says Velleius) recedit; Empires when
they can ascend no higher, must by the ordinary course of nature have a fall.
All these are indeed more then probable prognostications of a dying Monarchy:
but yet there is one greater, which is the present face of the state. The late
Emperor Mustapha is yet childlesse, and as report gives us utterly disabled
for generation. The young brother of Osmen, is but a weak staff for so huge
an Empire to lean on, considering not only the infinite sicknesses^, and
casualties of childhood; but also the danger he may justly expect from Mustapha
his uncle. For likely it is that he having at the death of Achmat, received the
government, and after by the faction of Osmen being deposed, restored and
displaced again, and his life continually endangered: will secure himself
from the like afterclapps, which may happen unto him, when this young boy shall
be a little older; by the taking of him away, if it be (as no question but it
is) possible. And so we have the end of the Ottoman race. Supposing then the
O^toman line to fail (as in all likelihood it may) what then becomes of this
vast Empire? Three there are which will bid fair for it, viz: the Crim Tartar,
the Bassa's, the Ianizaries. The Crim Tartar may plead a composition, which is,
that he supplying the Turks Armies with 60000 men without pay; is for these
succors to succeed in this Empire, whenever the heirs male do sail: and
besides this, he may hope for no small succors from his confederate, and allye
the great Cham, to recover his pretended right; and add to the present glory
of the Tartars, the renown of getting so glorious a booty. The Bassa's may
conceive no small hope of dividing the whole Monarchy among themselves; partly
by the example of Alexand^rs Captains, who after their masters death there
being yet some of the blood royal remaining, parted among themselves his
dominions: partly by an example in their own state, when after the death of
Aladine 2d; Caraman, Sarachan, Aidin, Carasus, and the rest of the more
powerful captains, divided among them, the Turkish kingdom in lesser Asia,:
and partly because being seated in most of the Provinces as governors, and
having diverse bands of Soldiers at command; they may easily make that their
own, in which they are so fairly estated already: for so we find the
Sultans, or provincial governors of the Caliphs, to have usurped those
Countries as proprietaries, to which they came but as substitutes. The
Ianizaries may also build their hopes on very fair foundations, as being the
sword and buckler of the Ottoman Empire: by their valor it being not only
gotten, but preserved. We see the Praetorian Soldiers (or Ianizaries) of the
Empire of Rome, which was a body far more politic and better compacted then
this, to have created out of the Soldiers their Emperors; the Senate and
Provinces never daring not to confirm their election. But above all examples,
that of the Mamaluckes of Egypt is most pregnant, who were borne of Christian
parents as these are; appointed for the guard of the Sultans, as these are;
purposely hi^ed to take from the natural subject the use of arms, as these
are; men of approved valor, and the greatest bulwark of that Turkish kingdom;
against the Christians, as these are; and why may not these be like unto them
also, in sitting in their masters seat. Add hereunto that they are already (in
a manner) possessed of Constantinople, the head town, and heart of the Empire;
and their hopes are not vain. For my part, I hold the^ to be the men most
likely, unless the Princes of Christendom, laying aside private malice, join
all in arms to strip this proud Peacock of her feathers: and (upon so blessed
an advantage) to break in pieces with a rod of iron, this insolent and
burdensome Monarchy. A thing rather to be desired the^ expected. But this by
way of supposition only, and as in a dream. I awake.

And thus much I thought convenient to insert in this place, concerning the
original, proceeding, and continuance; the natural dispositions, policies,
and forces of the Turks.

These three Provinces of Armenia being jointly considered, have suffered much
viciscitude of Fortune. For after they had long breathed a free air, they were
all subdued, 1 to the Persian Monarchy by Darius. 2 To the Groeians by
Alexander, after whose death the Country was governed by an interrupted
succession of many tributary Kings. The last of these Tigranes, taking on him
the protection of Syria, provoked the Romans to send Pompey against him: by
whom he was according to the chance of war^e taken prisoner, and sent captive
to Rome. 3 His kingdom was converted to a Province of the Roman Commonwealth.
4 In the division of the Empire between Theodosius his two sons; this
Country fell to the share of Arcadius. 5 In the reign of Heraclius it gave way
to the irresistable fury of the Saracens. 6 Anno 844 it became the habitation
of the Turks, a nation not so much as dreamt of. 7 The inundation of the
Tartars, and their violent head-spring Zingis overwhelmed it. 8 The Egyptian
Sultans, and the Mamalucks lorded over it. 9 The Persians, and 10 now the
Turks are masters of it.

Thus much of Armenia.

OF ARABIA.
ARABIA is bounded on the East with the Persian Gulf* on the West with the Red
Sea; on the North with Mesopotamia, and Palestine; on the South with the Ocean.

The people hereof are extremely addicted to theft, which is the better part
of their maintenance: they hate all sciences, as well Mechanical as Civil,
yet boast they much of their Nobility: they are of mean statures, feminine
voices, swift of foot, raw-boned, and tawny. They differ not much from the old
Arabians, who were a vagabond and theeuish nation. The most civil of them were
they of Arabia Faelix, who yet wanted not many barbarous customs; one whereof
was the community of one wife only, amongst a whole stock or kindred: and for
her to accompany another man, was the death of them both. A king of this
Country had 15 sons and but one daughter, who according to the custom was
when she came to age, the common wife of all her brothers. The young Lady
wearied with such a continued excess of dalliance, used this device to
prohibit their too frequent access to her. It was the fashion that every one
which used to one woman, had staffes of a like making; and when any of them
went in to their common wife, the setting of the staff before her chamber
door, forbad entrance to the rest till it were removed. This young Princess
secretly got a staff like unto these of her brothers, which when she was
desirous of priuacy, she placed at her chamber door, and so diverse times
deceived her brothers of their pleasures. It happened that all the brothers being
together, one of them departed toward his sisters lodging where finding a
staff before the door, and knowing where he had left the rest of his brothers;
he accused her of adultery; but the truth being known, the Lady was quitted,
and her brothers visitations were afterward limited.

This Country is 4000 miles in compass, and is usually divided into Arabia
Deserta, Petrosa, and Foelix. The people of al use the Arabicke language, which
not being confined within the narrow bounds of this one Province, extends it
self through Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, all Barbary, (excepting
Morocco) and is the sacred language of the Mahometans.

ARABIA DESERTA, is the place where the people of Israel wand^ed 40 years
long, under the command of Moses; being fed with Manna from heaven, and waters
out of the dryest rocks. The soil is neither fit for herbage nor tillage,
being covered over with a dry and thick sand. These sandy deserts are Seas of
Arabia; their ships, the Camels; being beasts content with little sustenance,
usually carrying 600 weight, and sometimes a thousand. The inhabitants of this
region are few, so are their Cities, the chief whereof is Bassora.

ARABIA PETROSA is so called, either because it is so rocky; or from Petra the
chief Town, now called Rathalalah: the second town of note, is Aresh, or
Arissa, consisting of a few houses, and a royal Castle, garrisoned with a
hundred soldiers. 3 Ezion Geber on the coast of the Red sea, where Solomon's
Navy kept station, before they put sail toward Ophir; and after they returned
thence. The Country is barren and desolate, bearing neither grass, nor trees;
the palm only excepted; good store of dromedaries it has, a beast of such
swiftnes, that it will easily carry a man 100 miles a day. Here is also good
store of Ostriches. But I return to Petra, which I find to have bin straightly
besieged by Seuerus, and before him, by Traian but with like success: The
Romans in the skirmishes and assaults being always put to the worst: nor did
Traia^e escape so free, but he was compelled to cast away his Imperial habit,
and fly for his life; the next man unto him being slain with a dart. Nay (if
we may credit Dion, who is never sparing of the like prodigies) the Heavens
fought against the Romans, with thunders, lightnings, whirlewinds, tempests; as
often as they made any battery against the City. This Country contains the
regions Nabathaeae, and Agara, whereof the first is sometimes used for all
Arabia, as in Ovid, Eurus ad Auroram Nabathaeaque regna recessit.
Eurus unto the East did fly,
Where blessed Arabia does lie.
The other was possessed by the Saracens or Hagarens, descended of Abraham and
Hagar. Here also dwelt the Emmins and Zanzummims cast out by the Amorites and
the Moabites: here also dwelt the Midianites, to whom Moses fled and kept
sheep: here also is Mount Horeb. This part of Arabia was first subdued and made
a Province of the Empire by Palma, Lieftenant of Syria, under the
aboue-mentioned Traiane.

ARABIA FOELIX contains the Peninsula, girt almost round with the Persian
Gulf, the Red sea, and the Ocean. In this Country is the Phoenix, which
growing old, burns it self, and from the ashes a new Phoenix is engendered.
This is the most fruitful and pleasant Country in Asia, abounding with Gold
and Pearls, with Balsamum, Myrrh, and Frankincense, especially about Saba the
principal City, (whence that of the Poet, Thure Sabaeo:) the rest of note
being 2 Medina, in or nigh unto which, the Impostor Mahomet composed his
Religion. This Town was the first that yielded unto Mahomet, after he began by
force of Arms to establish his Religion, and begin his Empire. And
questionless the taking hereof gave great reputation to his enterprise; for
Medina being taken, what City durst make resistance? 3 Zarvall the residence of
the Caliphs, till the building of Bagdet by Bugiafer. 4 Mecha, wherein
Christians are not permitted to enter, lest (I suppose) they should see the
absurdities of the Mahumetans adoration of their great Prophets Sepulcher:
whose body enclosed in an iron Coffer, was by an Adamant drawn up to the roof
of the Temple, where it still hangs. 5 Oran, the key of the South Ocean. 6
Danchali. 7 Elter, the only Town in Arabia, where the Christians are of the
greater number. The first Roman that ever made expedition into this Country,
was Largus, President of Egypt under Augustus; one Samos being then King
hereof. The Romans at first entrance, found no resistance; but when by the
extraordinary heat of the air, and drinking salt water, sickness began to grow
hot among them, the Arabians lustily falling upon them, made them retire with
more speed, and less honor, then they came thither. This Arabia is by Curtius
called, Odorum fertilitate nobilis regio, for the Frankincense, wherewith (as we
now said) it abounds: and is indeed so delicious a country, that Danaeus, in
his Commentary on Augustines Enchiridion ad Lawrentium, is persuaded, that it
was the local place of Paradise; Dicitur (says he) terrestris Paradisi regio
and pars quaedam esse Arabia, quae nunc appellatur Foelix.

This Country followed the fortune of the four great Monarchies, and was long
subject to the Greek Emperors, even until the reign of Heraclius: who
employing certain Arabians in an expedition against Persia: not only denied
them wages, but told them, that that was not to be given to dogs, which was
provided for the Roman Soldiers. Hereupon the Arabians revolt, and choose
Mahomet for their ringleader.

This Mahomet was borne in Itrarip, a Village of Arabia, Anno 572 his father
was a Pagan, full of Idolatry; his mother a Jew blinded with superstition: from
which worthy couple, could not but descend so godly an Imp as was Mahomet. At
the Age of 16 years, he bound himself to a Merchant, whose affairs he managed
with such care and discretion, that upon the death of his Master, his Mistress
took him for her husband; he being then aged 25 years. With her he lived till
the 38th year of his age; but then God permitting, and the Devil tempting him
to it, he began to affect the name and estimation of a Prophet; and so
cunningly he demeaned himself, that a sudden opinion of his sanctity was
quickly divulged. After this he exhorted the Arabians, to renounce their
alleagiance to the Greek Emperors. Thus he being now made Captain of a
rebellious multitude, inducted among them a new Religion, consisting partly of
Jewish ceremonies, which he learned of one Abdalla; partly of Christian
precepts, taught him by Sergius a Nestorian Monk; and partly of other
fantastical fopperies, which his own inventions suggested unto him.

The book of this Religion is called the Alcoran. It was composed by Osmen the
4th Caliph; who seeing the Saracens daily inclining to diverse Heresies, by
reason of some false copies of Mahomets Laws; and that the Empire by the same
means was likely to fall into civil dissentions: By the help of his wife, who
was Mahomets daughter, he got a sight of all Mahomets papers, which he reduced
into 4 Volumes, and divided into 206 Chapters: commanding expressly upon pain
of death, that that book, and that only, should be received as Canonical,
throughout his Dominions. The whole body of it is but an exposition and gloss
of these 8 Commandments.

First, every one ought to believe that God is a great God, and only God, and
Mahomet is his Prophet. They hold Abraham to be the friend of God, Moses the
messenger of God, and Christ the breath of God; whom they deny to be conceived
by the Holy Ghost* but that Mary grew with Child of him by smelling to a Rose,
and was delivered of him at her breasts. They deny the mystery of the Trinity,
and punish such as speak against CHRIST, whose Religion was not (they say)
taken away, but mended by Mahomet. And he who in his Pilgrimage to Mecha, does
not coming or going, visit the Sepulcher of CHRIST; is reputed not to have
merited, or bettered himself any thing by his journey.

2 Every man must marry to increase the Sectaries of Mahomet. Four wives he
allows to every man, and as many concubines as he will, between whom he
sets no difference either in affection, or in apparel, but that his wives
only can enjoy his Sabbaoths benevolence. The women are not admitted to their
Churches, nor after death to Paradise: and whereas in most or all other
countries, fathers give some portion with their daughters, the Saracens give
money for their wives: which being once paid, the contract is registered in the
Cadies book, and this is all their formality of marriage. More of this theme
we have spoken in Turcomania.

3 Every one must give of his wealth to the poor. Hence you shall have some
buy slaves, and then manu-mit them: buy birds, and then let them fly. They use
commonly to free prisoners, release bond-slaues, build Can^s for the relief of
Passengers, repair bridges, and mend high ways. But their most ordinary alms
consist in Sacrifices of Sheep or Oxen, which when the solemnity is performed,
they distribute among the poor: insomuch that you shall hardly find any
beggars among them.

4 Every one must make his prayers five times in a day. When they pray* they
turn their bodies toward Mecha, but their faces sometimes one way, sometimes
another way, believing that he shall come behind them, being at their
devotions. The first time is an hour before Sunrising; the second at noone
day; the third at three of the clock afternoon, the fourth at Sunsetting; the
fifth and last before they go to sleep. At all these times the Cryers keep a
bawling in the steeples (for the Turks and Saracens have no bells) for the
people to come to Church. And such as cannot come, must when they hear the
voice of the Cryers, fall down in the place where they are, do their
devotions, and kiss the ground thrice.

5 Every one must keep a Lent one month in the year. This Lent is called
Ramazan, in which they suppose the Alcoran was given unto Mahomet, by an
Angel. This fast is only intended in the days, the Law giving leave to
frolic it in the nights, as they best please.

6 Be obedient to thy parents; which Law is the most neglected of any, never
any Children being so unnatural as the Turkish.

7 Thou shall not kill: which they keep vnviolated amongst themselves: but the
poor Christians are sure to feel the smart of their fury. And as if by this
Law the actual shedding of blood only were prohibited, they have invented
punishments for their offenders, worse then death it self; as 1 the strappado,
which is hanging of them by the Arms drawn backward: when they are so bound,
they are drawn up on high, and let down again with a violent swing, which
vnioynteth all their back and arms. Secondly, they use to hoyse up their
heels, and with a great cudgel to give them 3 or 400 blows on the soles of
their feet. Thirdly, it is ordinary to draw them naked up to the top of a
gibbet, or tower, full of hooks; and cutting the rope, to let them fall down
again. But by the way they are caught by some of the hooks, where they
commonly hang till they die for hunger.

8 Do unto others as thou would be done unto thy self. To those that keep
these Laws, he promises Paradise, spread here and there with silk carpets,
adorned with flowery fields, watered with Crystalline rivers, beautified with
trees of Gold, under whose cool shade they shall spend their times with
amorous Virgins, whose mansion shall not be far distant. The men shall never
exceed the age of 30, nor the women of fifteen; and both shall have their
virginities renewed as fast as lost.

Friday he ordained to be the Sabbath day, partly to distinguish his followers
from the Jews, and Christians, who solemnize the days ensuing; but
principally because he was on that day proclaimed Caliph, and solemnly so
created. Wine, and swinesslesh are the principal things forbidden by the
Alcoran, the last whereof they abstemiously refrain from; but on the first they
are so sotted* that when they come at it, they seldom go home again vnled;
insomuch, that all the Wines in Constantinople have bin thrown about the
streets, and death made the penalty for any that will presume to bring any more
into the City.

Mahomet taught them that every one should be saved by his own Religion, him
only excepted that revolteth from the Alcoran, unto another Law; and that at
the end of the World* all men that professed any Religion, should go into
Paradise; the Jews under the banner of Moses, the Christians under the banner
of CHRIST, and the Sarracens under the banner of Mahomet. They compel no man
therefore to abjure the faith in which he was borne, but commend and approve
secretly such as they find zealous and constant in their own Religion: yet
holding it an especial honor to have daily new Proselites, they incite them
by hope of freedom and preferment, which with many are motives too much
prevailing. Hence I have heard many say, that it is better for a man that would
enjoy liberty of conscience, to live in the Countries professing Mahumetanisme,
then Papistry: for in the one he shall never be free from the bloody
Inquisition; in the other he is never molested if he meddle not with their Law,
their Women, or their slaves.

The opinions which they hold concerning the end of the World, are very
ridiculous; as that at the winding of a horn, not all flesh only, but the
Angels themselves shall die; that the Earth with an Earthquake shall be
kneaded together like a lump of dough; that a second blast of the same horn
shall after 40 days restore all again; that Cain shall be the Captain or
ringleader of the damned, who shall have the countenances of dogs and Swine;
that they shall pass over the bridge of iust^ce* laden with their sins in
satchels; that the great sinners shall fall into hell, the lesser into
Purgatory only, with a thousand of the like fopperies.

This Religion thus compiled, was greedily received by the Sarracens, a people
of Arabia Deserta; so called (not of Sara, but Sarra) signifying a desert, and
Saken, to inhabit; or from Sarak, betokening thieves, a name fitly
correspondent to their nat^^es. The causes of the deplorable increase and
continuance of his irrel^gious Religion, are 6. 1 The greatness of the victories
of the Sarracens; who easily compelled the conquered to embrace their
superstitions. 2 A peremptory restraint of all disputation in any point of
Religion whatsoever. 3 The suppression of Philosophy and humane Arts; the light
of which, could not but erect the grossen^sse of their tenants. 4 The sensual
liberty allowed of having variety of wives. 5 The promise of (...) after death;
with which a sense not enlightened with the spirit of God, cannot but be more
affected, then with a mere speculatiue hope of spiritual delig^ts. And 6 the
forbidding of Print^ng, and printed books; by which the people might truly know
the verity of Christian Religion, and the apparent falsehood of their own
Mahumetan.

Mahomet was of low stature, schald-headed, evil proportioned, and as evil
conditioned; being naturally addicted to all villainies, infinitely theeuish, and
insatiably leacherous. He was troubled almost continually with the
Falling-sicknes; to mask which infirmity, as repugnant to his pretended
omnipotency; he said it was only a divine rapture, wherein he conversed with
the Angel Gabriel. He was well seen in Magic, by whose aid and help of the
Di^ell, he taught a white Pigeon to feed at his care, affirm^ng it to be the
Holy Ghost, which informed him in divine precepts. By these policies he
strengthened himself with the discontented Arabians, who first freed themselves
from the allegiance to the Grecian Empire; but not without some resistance of
the Philarchi, or Nobility of Mecha, who drove him forcibly from their
territories, which not long after he subdued, casting thence the Greek
o^^icers. From this return of his, after his flight from Mecha, the Sarracens
began their computation of years (as we from CHRIST'S Nativity) which they call
the Hegira; which begins about the year of our redemption 617: concerning
which time, I cannot but observe, that Mahomet compiled his devilish doctrine,
beginning his Empire; and Boniface the third his Antichristian title, beginning
his Empire, nigh about the same year.

names only of the Syrian or Babylonian Caliphs; for story of them I find little
or none.

21 Mustatzen the last Caliph or high priest of the Sarracens, in Syria and
Babylon. Yet have they still remaining a carcass of the old Body, one whom
they call Caliph, at whose hands the neighbor Princes use to receive their
Diadems and Regalities: and so we find Solomon the magnificent, after his
conquest of Chaldea, M^sopotamia* and Assyria, to have bin by one of these
poor titulary Caliphs, created king of Babylon, Anno 1543.

This vnweildie Body of the Sarracen Empire, having thus two heads, began
apparently to decline; loosing to the kings of Leon and Oviedo, the greatest
part of Spain: to the Genois, Sardinia, and Corsica: to the Normans, Naples
and Sicily: and finally most of their Empire, with their very names, to the
Turks and Tartars* For Allan a Tartarian Captain, starued Mustatzem a
Babylonian Caliph, in his Tower of Bagde^, and rooted out all his posterity:
and Sarracon the first Turkish king of Egypt, brained the last Egyptian Caliph
with his horsemans Mace, leaving not one of his Issue or kindred surviuing. The
office of the Caliphs is now executed in the Turks Dominion by the Musti, or
chief Priest of the Sarracens.

As Mars showed himself a coadiutor to these Moors in their stupendous
triumphs, so also did Phoebus power down no less celestial influence, on such
as addicted themselves to schollership. Bagdet in Chaldea, Cairoan, Fess,
Morocco in Barbary, and Corduba in Spain, were their Universities: out of
which came the Philosophers, Avicen, and Averroes: the Physicians Rhasis, and
Mesue: The Geographers Leo and Abilfada; and almost all the Textuaries and
found Writers, as Hali, Algazel, Albumazar, etc. in Astrology; from whom the
greatest part of our Astronomicall and Astrologicall terms are borrowed.

There is now no Kingdom, Island, or Province, which acknowledges the Empire
of the Saracens, but the Kingdom of Fesse, and Morocco in Barbary. And now it
is time to return again to Arabia, which followed (as we told you) the fortune
of the four great monarchies. In the conquest of it by the first three, there
occurreth nothing of any note; in the last, this is most remarkable. When
Alexander was in his adolescencie or boyage, he on a time sacrificing to the
gods, cast into the fire with both his hands, abundance of myrrh and
frankincense; which Leonidas one of the Nobility marking, advised him to be
more sparing of that precicus and dear commodity; til he was master of the
Country where it grew. This admonition Alexander (when he had conquered Arabia)
remembering, sent a ship laden with frankincense to Leonidas, bidding him
hereafter serve the Gods more liberally, It was subdued unto the Turks by
Selimus the first, immediately after his conquest of Egypt: yet are the people
rather tributaries unto, then prouincialls of the Turkish Empire. Two kings
they have of their own, whereof the one continually resideth in some good town
of Arabia: the other haunteth about Syria, and the Holy land; living in tents,
and being followed by the wild and theeuish Arabs.

Thus much of Arabia.

OF ASSYRIA, MESOPOTAMIA, AND CHALDEA,
ASSYRIA has on the East Media, on the West Mesopotamia, Maginus.
on the North Armenia minor, and on the South Susiana, a Province of Persia.

This Region took its name from Assure, second son to Sem, who with his Family
retired himself hither, after the confusion of tongues. It is now (as Maginus
informs us) called by Niger, Adrinsa; by Mercator, Sarth; by Pin^tus, Mosul;
by some, Azemia; by others, Arzerum. It contains the Provinces of old
Adiabene, Arrapachite, and Sittacene.

It is a custom, which has from all antiquity bin used in this Country, that
the maids which are marriageable, are yearly brought forth in public, and
set to sale to such as would marry them: and the money which was given for the
fairest, was by the Arithmeticall proportion of Justice, given to the more
deformed for their portions, to make them go off the better and quicker. And
hence perhaps the Fathers of our times use to give least money with such of
their daughters, whose beauty is a sufficient dowry: but to grease the fat
sowes, with the addition of some hundreds of pounds; which made the merry
fellow say, that the money was a good match, if the wench were absent.

The chief Cities were and are Ninive, built by Ninus the Assyrian Monarch; a
great City, of three days journey, and in circuit 66 miles. The walls hereof
were in height 100 foot, in breadth able to contain 3 Carts a breast: Towers in
the wall 1500, every one 200 foot high: In the Hebrew it is called Ruhaboth; in
Eusebius time Nisib; now almost ruined to nothing.

Sic patet exemplis oppida posse mori.
Examples plainly do affirm,
Towns have for life a settled term:
Through this City ran the fair and famous river Euphrates; of which there
was an old prophecy, that the town should never be forced, till the river
proved its enemy. This made Sardanapalus make it the seat of war against
Belochus and Arbaces; who having for three whole years besieged it, the river
ouer-flowed its banks, and ouer-threw twenty furlong of the walls: Which
accident compelled Sardanapalus to that desperate extremity, that he burned
himself; and the enemy entered the Town. To this City Jonah was sent to preach,
here being 1200000 persons that knew not the right hand from the left. 2
Arzeri, whence the whole Region is called Arzeri. 3 Aruela, nigh unto which,
Alexander fought his third and last battle against Darius, and his Persians;
who being in number 800000, went home fewer by far then they came thither.
Not long after this victory, Darius died, and Alexander was installed in the
Persian Monarchy. 4 Serta. 5 Musall, the seat of the Nestorian Patriarch.

MESOPOTAMIA has on the East Tigris, on the West Euphrates, on the North the
hill Caucasus, on the South Chaldea. This Country in holy Scriptures is called
Padan Aram; as also Mesopotamia, quasi (...), because it is environed with the
rivers Tigris and Euphrates, which ouerflow the Country, as Nilus does Egypt,
making it very fertile; and now it is called Dierbecke.

The soil is exceeding fertile, yielding in most places 200, in some 300
increase. Here Abraham was borne: hither he sent his servant to choose a wife
for his son Isaac: hither Jacob fled from his brother Esau. And here Paradise
is by men both skilled in Divinity, and Geography, affirmed to have stood. Yet
amongst all sorts of Writers we find different opinions. Some make Paradise to
signify a place of pleasure, and the four Rivers to be the four Cardinal
Virtues: but these allegories on the Scriptures are not warrantable. Others
place it in the air, under the circle of the Moon; and tell us that the 4
rivers in the Scriptures mentioned, fall down from thence, and runn^ng all
under the Ocean, rise up again in those places where they are now found: but
this is so vain a foppery, that I will not honor it with a confutation. Such
as make Paradise local, are also divided into 3 ranks, (for I omit the rest)
whereof some place it under the Equator; but this agrees not with the bounds
prescribed by the Holy Ghost. Some conceive the 4 rivers to be Tigris,
Euphrates, Nilus, and Ganges; and that Paradise was the whole World: but this
cannot be, for then when Adam was driven out of Paradise, it must also follow
that he was driven out of the World, which were absurd. Those of the soundest
judgments place it here, in an Island which is made by the Rivers Tigris and
Euphrates, and some branches running from them: the uppermost of them they
defend to be Pison (falsely rendered Ganges) which waters the land of Havilah,
now called Susiana; and the lowermost to be Gihon (improperly translated Nilu^)
as running through Aethiopia Asiatica, which we shall further explain when we
come into Afric. The reasons are, because Nilus and Ganges are too far
distant, and different in their course to spring from one fountain, and that
this Country is situate East of Arabia, where Moses was when he wrote Genesis.

The chief Cities are Rechiais, formerly Edessa, whereof Agbarus was governor,
who writ an Epistle to our Savior CHRIST, Herodian.
and from him received an answer; the Copies whereof Eusebius sets down in
the end of his first book. Near unto this town Antoninus Caracalla, son to
Septimius Severus, Emperor of Rome, was slain by the appointment of Macrinus,
Captain of the Guard, herein disappointing Caracalla, who intended to have made
Macrinus shorter by the head. For Caracalla, conscious of his own unworthiness
to rule the Empire, and fearing revenge for the many murders he had in Rome
committed; sent to Maternianus his friend, desiring him to enquire of the
Magicians, who should be his successor: He returned answer, that Macrinus was
the man. The packet of Letters among which this was, was brought to Caracalla,
as he was riding in his Chariot, who therefore delivered them to Macrinus, whose
office (besides the government of the Praetorian gua^d) was to read and answer
Letters of ordinary import. The Letter concerning himself coming to his hand,
he seeing his imminent peril, resolved to strike the first blow; and to that
end entrusted Martialis, one of his Centurions, who killed the unfortunate
Emperor, as he withdrew himself, levandae vesica gratia. It will not be any
way amiss in this place to note; that all, or most of the Emperors before
Constantine (who first received the faith) died unnatural deaths: but such as
succeeded him, went to their graves in peace, and full of years: from Julius
Caesar unto Constantine, are numbered 40 Emperors, of which, Julius was openly
murdered in the Senate House: Augustus death was hastened by his wife Livia;
Tiberius by Macro, Caligula was slain by Cassius Chereas; Claudius poisoned by
Agrippina: Nero and Otho laid violent hands on themselves. Galba and Vitellius
were massacred by the Soldiers; Domitian by Stephanus; Commodus by Letus and
Electus; Pertinax, and Iulianus by the tumultuous Guard; Caracalla by the
command of Macrinus; Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander Severus, Maximinus,
Maximus, and Balbienus, successively by the men of war; Gordianus by Philip;
Philip by the Soldiers; Hostilianus by Gallus and Aemilianus; they by the
Soldiers; Valerianus died prisoner in Parthia; Florianus and Diocl^sian were
the Authors of their own ends. Aurelianus was murdered by his household servants.
Gallienus, Quintilius, Tacitus and Probus by the fury of the military men. I
have out of this bedroll, purposely omitted such Emperors as were made by the
Armies, without the approbation of the Senate; as also the Caesar's, or designed
successors of the Empire; most of whom got nothing by their designation or
adoption, but ut citius intersicerentur. Some of these were cut off for their
misdemeanors: some for seeking to reviue again the ancient Discipline: and
some that others might enjoy their places. The chief cause of these continual
massacres, proceeded originally from the Senate and Emperors themselves. For
when the Senators had once permitted the Soldiers to elect Galba, and had
confirmed that election, Evulgato (says Tacitus) imperij arcano, principem
alibi quam Romae fieri posse; more Emperors were made abroad in the field by
the Legions, then at home by them. Secondly, from the Emperors, who by an
unseasonable love to their guard soldiers, so strengthened them by
privileges, and nusled them in their licentious courses; that on the smallest
rebuke, they which were appointed for the safety of the Princes, proved the
Authors of their ruin; so truly was it said by Augustus in Dion: Metuendum est
esse sine custode, sed multo magis a custode metuendum est. The last cause (be
it causa per accidens, or per se) was the largess which the new Emperors used
to give unto the men of service. This custom was begun by Claudius Caesar, and
continued by all his successors; insomuch that the Empire became saleable, and
many times he which bade most, had it: As we see in Dion, when Sulpitianus
offering twenty S^stertiums to each Soldier, was (as if they had bin buying a
stock at Gleeke) outbidden by Iulianus, who promised them 25 Sestertiums a man.
So that Herodian ius^ly complains of this donatiue. Id initium causaque
militibus fuit, ut etiam in posterum turpissimi contumacissimique evaderent;
sic ut avaritia indies, ac principum contemptus, etiam ad sanguinem usque
proveherentur. But it is now high time to go on in my journey to Carra,
observing only by the way, that when the valorous Christians had recovered this
Country, and the Holy land; for the more facile administration of Justice, they
divided the whole Conquest in 4 Tetrarchies; namely 1 Jerusalem, 2 Antioch, 3
Tripolis, 4 This Edessa; under every one of which were many subordinate Lords,
being all subject to the Kings of Jerusalem. 2 Carra, called (Genesis 12.) by
Moses, Haran; where Abraham dwelt, having left Vr. In this town the Moon was
worshipped in both sexes: some honoring it as a female; then she was called
Dea Luna; others as a male, and then Deus Lunus was his name: but with this
fortune, both: Qui Lunam faemineo nomine putabat nuncupandam, is mulieribus
semper inserviat; at vero qui marem Deum esse crediderit, is uxori dominetur. I
dare presume there were but few men of the former Religion: So unwilling are
they to be under the command of their wives; neither will I herein blame them.
Nigh unto this town was Crassus the Roman Lieftenant, and one of the richest
men that ever that Commonwealth knew* (for he was worth 7100 talents; the tenth
being deduced, which he offered to Hercules, and three month corn given to

CHALDEA is bounded on the East with Assyria, on the West with Syria, on the
North with Armenia, and on the South with Arabia Deserta.

The chief Cities were Vr, now Horrea, whence Abraham* departed when he went
to live at Haran. 2 Erech. 3 Accad. 4 Carnell. and 5 Babel (Genesis 10.10.) This
Babel (in the Hebrew it signifies confusion) is famous for the confusion of
languages, which here happened: for immediately after the Universal deluge,
Nimrod the son of Chus, the son of Cham, persuaded the people to secure
themselves from the like after-claps, by building some stupendous Edifice,
which might resist the sury of a second deluge. This counsel was generally
embraced, Heber only and his Family, contradicting such an unlawful attempt.
The mayor part prevailing, the Tower began to rear a head of Majesty, 5164
paces from the ground: having its basis and circumference equal to the height.
The passage to go up, went winding about the outside, and was of an exceeding
great breadth, there being not only room for horses, carts, and the like means
of carriage, to meet and turn; but lodgings also for man and beast, and (as
some report) grass and corne-fields for their nourishment. But God beholding
from high this fond attempt, sent amongst them (who before were one language) a
confusion of 72 tongues: which hindered the proceeding of this building, one not
being able to understand what his fellow called for. Bring me (quoth one) a
trowell, quickly quick;
One brings him up a hammer: hew this brick
(Another bids) and then they cleave a tree:
Make fast this rope, and then they let it flee:
One calls for planks, another mortar lackes:
They bring the first a stone; the last an axe.
Thus being compelled to desist from so unlucky an enterprise, they greedily
sought out such as they could understand, with whom consorting themselves, they
forget their former acquaintances, and now are divided into 72 different
nations: comprehending about 24000 men, besides women and children. Of these 72
nations, 27 of several language, being the posterity of Sem, dispersed
themselves about Asia: 30 others, of the loins of Cham, peopled Africa: and 15
more, being the issue of Iaphet, withdrew themselves toward Europe, and Asia
the less. The sons of this Iaphet were first Gomer, from whom are descended
the Germans and Gauls, called of of old Gomeri, and Cimbri. 2 Magog, father to
the Magogins, or Scythians. 3 Madus, the author of the Madians, or Medes. 4
Tubal, the progenitour of the Spaniards. 5 Iavan, the parent of the Greeks and
Ionians. 6 Meschus, the founder of the Mescates ^or Cappadocians. 7 There^,
whose offspring is the Thracians. From out this Gomers loins they say sprung
all
The warlike nations scattered over Gaul,
And Germans too, yerst called Gomerites.
From Tubal Spaniards, and from Magog Seytes.
From Madai Medes, from Mesech Mazacons,
From Iavan Greeks, from Thyras Thracians.
Sem had five sons: from Elam descended the Elamites or Persians: from 2
Assure the Assyrians: from 3 Arphaxad the Arphaxadians, or Chaldes (his son
Heber was father to the Hebrews^) from 4 Aram the Aramites, or Syrians: and
from Lud, the peoply of Lydia. The Sceptred Elam chose the Persian hills
Assure Assyria with his people fills:
Lud Lydia; Aram all Syria had,
And Chaldey fell to learned Arphaxad.
The sons of Ham were four only: from Canaan descended the Cananites, being
subdivided into Hittites, Perezites, Amorites, Iebusites, etc. 2 from Cush, the
father of the first Babylonian Monarch Nimrod, sprang the Cushians, or
Aethiopians* from 3 Phut, the Phutians, Lybians, and Mauritanians, among whom
there is a river of this name. from 4 Misraim the Egyptians.

Phut peopled Lybia, Misraim Egypt manned,
The first borne Cush the Ethiopian strand:
And Canaan does nigh Iordans waters dwell,
One day ordained to harbor Israel.
These being thus dispersed, and afterward growing too populous for their first
habitation; continually went out to seek new dwelling places* So the Gauls
filled Brittanie, the Britains Ireland; the Irish Scotland, and the Isles; so
the Tyrian and Phoenicians planted their Colonies in diverse places, the Saca
came into Saxony, and the northern regions continually used to send abroad
the superfluity of their inhabitants. And thus much in this place concerning
the confusion of tongues, and peopling of the world by diverse nations after the
universal deluge.

Babylon, howsoever the tower was hindered, went forward and was finished by
Semiramis, whose walls were in circuit 60 miles 200 foot high, and 50 Cubits
broad. As Semiramis once was platting her hair, news was brought her of the
revolt of this Town; whereupon leaving her head half undressed, she went and
besieged it; never ordering the rest of her hair till she had again recovered
it. How it fell into the hands of Cyrus, we learn out of Xenophons Cyri paideia
which was in this manner. The river Euphrates ran quite through the town,
round about whose banks the politic Prince cut many and deep channells: into
which, when the Babylonians were securely merry at a general feast, he
suddenly drained and emptied the river, conueying his whole forces into the
Town all along the dry and yielding Channel, and in little time made himself
master of it. From the Persians it revolted in the reign of Darius Histaspis,
and that sustenance might not be wanting to the men of war they strangled the
most part of the women; being in actions of this quality, not so much as
necessary evils. When they had for twenty months so defended the Town, that
the Persians had less hope then ever of prevailing; Zopirus one of Darius
Captains, mangling his body and disfiguring his face by cutting often his nose
and ears; fled to the Babylonians, complaining of the tyranny of his King.
They crediting his words, and knowing his prowess, committed the charge of the
whole army unto him; as a man, to whom such barbarous usage had made the King
irreconcilable. But he taking his best opportunity, delivered both the Town
and Soldiers into the hands of his Sovereign. Here died Alexander the Great,
after whose death the Grecian Captains regardfull rather of their own
ambitio^s, then the common loyalty; divided the Empire among themselves;
leaving the body of the King 8 days vnbutied. A wonderful change of fortune:
he who living thought the world too little for his valor, being dead found no
place big enough for his body. Aristotle says, that when Babylon was taken by
the Greek army, under the leading of this Macedonian Captain; it was 3 days,
before one part took notice of the conquest. Nabuchadnezar mightily increased
this City; which being almost ruined, was reedified by Bugiafar, Caliph of the
Sarracens, at the expense of 18 millions of gold: and because of the many
Gardens contained in it, he caused it to be called Bagadet or Bagdet, from
Baga, in the Arabian tongue signifying a Garden. This is still a Town of great
traffiq^e, between which and Aleppo Carriers travel very often with many
hundred Camels laden with commodities. This Conuoy is called the Carauan.
Between these two places they have a custom of sending Post-pigeons, or
sending by Pigeons letters of all occurences in have; which is done in this
manner. When the hen-doue sits and has young, they take the Cock Pigeon,
and put him into a cage; whom when he is by the Carauan carried a days journey
off, they set at liberty, and he straight flies home to his make. When by
degrees they are perfectly taught, the Carriers and Merchants on any accident,
fasten a letter about one of their necks; and they being freed, without any
stay have to the place from whence they were brought. And such as at home do
watch their return, clime their hole, and taking a way the letter, are
certified of the estate of the Carauan, or any other tidings whatsoever.

The chief principal rivers of these Countries are 1 Euphrates beyond which
the Romans could hardly extend their Empire: and 2 Tigris so named for its
swiftness; the word in the Medians language signifying an Arrow: this river
arises about Libanus, and disburdeneth himself into the Persian Sea.

The faith of Christ was first planted here by Jude the Apostle; and now is
almost worn out by the Mahumetan superstition.

The language is diverse, some men speaking the Arabicke; some the Persian,
others the Turkish language.

Out of Chaldea the 3 wise men of the East are thought to have come, who
worshipped Christ and presented gifts unto him. Here flourished many and the
very first Astronomers, who had two great helps to perfect this science: first
a plain country yielding a fair sensible Horizon (for the rational is a like
to hills and valleys) and by consequence profitable to the observation of the
Heliacal, Acronical, Matutine, and Vespertine rising and falling of every
star: secondly a long life, fraught with sufficient experience, concerning
the motion (whether commning with the Primum Mobile, or proper to every
distinct Sphere) of all the stars and Planets.

The Assyrian or Chaldean Monarchs.
1798 1 Nimrod, called also Saturnus Babylonicus, the son of Chus, the son
of Cham, was the first that ever bore title of King. 25. 1845 2 Belus or
Jupiter Babylonicus, whose Image was worshipped by the Heathenish and Jewish
Idolaters, under the name of Baal and Bell, 26. 1907 3 Ninus united to his
Empire the kingdom of Armenia, Media, Arabia, Bactria, and Lybia 52. 1959 4
Semiramis the foundresse of Babylon, subdued the Aethiopians, the Indians, and
their King Staurobates, 42. She was borne at Ascalon, a Town in Syria, and
exposed to the fury of wild beasts. But being borne not to dye so ingloriously,
she was brought up by Shepherds, and at full age presented to the Syrian
Viceroy, who gave her in marriage to his only son. Going with him to the wars
she ^ell in acquaintance with Ninus, who liking her body and spirit took her
to his bed. This bred in him a greater affection toward her, so that he granted
her at her request, the command of the Empire for five days; making a decree
that her will in all things should be punctually performed: which boon being
gotten, she put on the royal robes, and commanded the King to be slain.
Having thus gotten the Empire, she exceedingly enlarged it, leading with her an
army consisting of 100000 Chariots of war, three millions of foot, and half
a million of horse. A woman in whom there was nothing to be honored and
applauded, but her insatiable lusts. 2001 5 Ninus, or Aramphel, as the

Of these 38 Kings we find scarce any thing remaining but the names, which are
in this order registered by Berosus, or rather by Annius a Monk of Viterbum in
Tuscanie, who has thrust upon the world the fancies of his own brain, under
the name of that ancient historian. The chief Kings of note after Semiramis
were, 1 Ninus, Amraphell or Zameis her son, who sudued the Arians, Bactrians,
and Caspians; but was otherwise a man of effeminate and unkingly carriage. 2
Belus extended the Assyrian Monarchy to Iudaea, subduing many nations: he was
for his valor surnamed by the after-writers Xerxes, i. e. the warrior, or the
conqueror. 3 Mamitus revived again the ancient discipline, corrupted by his
predecessors; he awed Syria, and Egypt. 4 Ascatades perfected the conquest of
Syria. 5 Belochus Priscus was the author of divination, by the flying of Birds
called Auspicium. Of soothsaying there were in all 4 Kings; 1 this Auspicium,
quasi auispicium, taken from the flight of Birds, either on the right or the
left: and hence the proverb comes ami sinistra, good luck; because in giving
the right hand is opposite to the receauers left: or from the number of the
Birds, whence Romulus was promised the Empire before his brother, because he
had seen the double number: or lastly, from the nature of them, whence the
same Romulus seeing the vultures was, says Florus, spei plenus vrbem
bellatricem fore, ita illi sanguini and praedae assuetae aves pollicebantur.
2ly Aruspicium ab aras inspiciendo, in which the Soothsayers observed whether
the beast to be sacrificed, came to the Altar willingly or not; whether the
intrailes were of natural color, exulcerate, etc. or whether any part was
wanting. All Histories and Poets afford variety of examples of this kind; I
need give no particular instance. This divination was first practiced by the
Hetrurians, who received their knowledge from one Tages, who arising to
certain plowmen out of a furrow, taught them this skill and then vanished. 3ly
Tripudium quasi ter^ipudium, or terripanium, was a coniecturing of future
successes, by the rebounding of crummes cast into chickens. We have an
instance of this in the life of Tiberius Gracchus, who being busy about the
Law Agraria; was forewarned by the keeper of his Chickens to desist, because
when he had cast the crummmes to the coop, one only of the Chickens came out,
and the same without eating returned in again: which was a sign of ill luck,
as the greedy devouring of them had been of good. But Tiberius not regarding
the omen, was that day slain. It is said to have been invented by the
Lycians. 4ly Angurium ab auium garritu, was a pr^diction from the chirping or
chattering of Birds; as also by the sounds and voices we hear we known not
whence, from what cause. In this latter kind, the death of Julius Caesar was
diuined, by the clattering of the armor in his house; and the poisoning of
Germanicus by the sounding of a Trumpet of it is own accord. In the former an
Owl schreeching in the Senate house, was deemed ominous to Augustus: and a
company of Crows accompanying home Seianus, with great clamours and croakings;
was deemed fatal to that great favorite: and so it proved. 6 Sardanapalus
being wondrous effeminate, and unworthy to govern so potent a nation; was
deposed by Arbaces, Captain of Media; and Belochus, Leistenant of Babylon; who
compelled Sardanapalus to burn himself with all his riches for fear of more
pain.


The treasure which Sardanapalus burnt with him, was 100 millions of talents in
gold; and 1000 millions of talents in silver: which in our money amounts to 20
thousand and 500 millions of pounds. A mass of money which surely had not seen
the Sun in many years, (I had almost said ages) and therefore grown rustie,
desired a fire to purge it. This Sardanapalus afforded it; it may be to end his
life with that, in which he placed his Summum bonum: It may be in spite unto
his enemies: and it is possible it might be in policy; that so great a treasure
not fallen to the possession of his foes, might so much the more disable them
from making resistance against, or detaining the Empire from his next
successor. For it is of all things the most foolish both to loose our treasure,
and with it to enrich our adversaries. On which consideration the Spaniards
fired their Indian fleet at Gades, and the Genoais theirs at Tripolis; that
their lading might not come into the possession of their enemies; the English
and Mahumetans. After the death of this Sardanapalus, Arbaces took Media and
Persia with the confining Provinces: Belochus strengthened himself with
Assyria, Chaldaea and the adjacent regions; his kingdom being called the new
kingdom of Assyria. The new Kings of Assyriae, and Chaldea.
3146 1 Phul Belocus, the beginner of this new Monarchy. 3194 2 Phul Assure,
destroyed Galile, 23. 3217 3 Salmanasar, who destroyed Samaria, ruined the
kingdom of Israel, and carried the 10 Tribes to perpetual captivity, 10. This
is the Nabonassar of the Chronologers. 3227 4 Sennacherib, whose blaspheamous
host was vanquished by Angels from heaven, and he himself murdered by his
two sons, 7. 3233 5 Aserrhaddon, who revenging his fathers death on his
brothers, was deposed by his deputy of Chaldea, and the seat royal transferred
from Ninivie to Babylon, 10. 3243 6 Merodach Baladan, governor of Babylon 40.
3283 7 Ben Merodach 2. 3304 8 Nabocpullassar, wh^vanquished Pharaoh, Necho K.
of Egypt, 25. 3339 9 Nabuchodonaser the great, commonly called the Hercules of
the East. He conquered Egypt, repaired Babylon, subverted Ninive: and in the 18
year of his reign he destroyed Jerusalem, and carried the people captive unto
Babylon. The last 7 years of his reign, he was distract of his wits, and
lived like the beasts of the field according to the word of God spoken by
Daniel cap. 4. during which time his son Euilmerodach, Nicrocris his
daughter, with her husband Niglissar, and their son Labosarodach; successively
governed the state, as protectours, and therefore are by some reckoned as
kings. Finally Nabuchodonazar having recovered his senses, died when he had
reigned 44 years. 3383 10 Evilmerodach, slain by Astiages King of the Medes,
26. 3409 11 Balthassar, son to Evilmerod^ch, a Prince of dissolute and cruel
nature, was assailed by Darius and Cyrus successors of Astiages, by whom his
Empire was taken from him, and himself slain 17. A.M. 3426.
That this was the end of Balthassar, is the common opinion. But Joseph
Scaliger in his learned and industrious work, de emendatione temporum, makes
him to be slain in a tumult by his own people: who elected into the Empire a
Noble man of the Medes, called in profane stories, Nabonnedus; in divine
Darius Medus; who after a 17 years reign, was slain by Cyrus King of the
Persians. By the leave of so worthy a man, this cannot hold good. For the Lord
by his Prophet Jeremy, had pronounced (Chap. 27.) That all nations should
serve Nabucadnezzar, and his son, and his sons son: whereas Nabonnedus
was a Prince of a strange blood, and so the nation were not to serve him; and
in Balthassar, the sons son of Nabuchadnezzar, was this oracle finished.
But let us examine his arguments; and withal the scoffs, which very
prodigally he bestows on such as maintain the contrary opinion. Natio
Chronologorum, the whole rout of Chronologers: boni and diligentes viri, good
simple meaning men: and addunt alia nihilo veriora, are his first complements.
Vt igitur, quod chronologorum est, omnes resipiscant, etc. therefore that they
may repent their ever being Chronologers, he brings in Berosus, cited by
Josephus, in his first book against Appion. But Berosus there makes
Nabonnedus (to whom he says the kingdom of Balthassar was by the people
delivered) to be a Babylonian; and not as Scaliger would have him say, a noble
man of the Medes: neither can the authority of Berosus, countervaile that of
Daniel, who in his 6 Chapter tells Balthassar, that his kingdom should be
divided among the Medes and Persians. His 2d argument is drawn from the nature
of the word (...), as it is in the same Chapter; and Darius the Mede took the
Empire: by which word, took, is implied, not a forcible invasion, but a
willing acceptance of the Empire offered. To this we answer, that Darius
indeed took the Empire quietly and willingly* being offered unto him by Cyrus,
and his army, consisting of Medes and ^ersians: who according to the word of
God, had taken it from Baltassar, Darius being then absent. Quid si probauero
(says he) eum cognominatum fuisse Medum? he has yet one trick more then all
these: and Medus must not be the national name, but the surname of Darius;
which he proves out of a fragment of Megasthenes, cited by Eusebius, in his
work de praeparatione Euangelica, where he is called (...), etc. an argument
of all others the most slight and triuiall. For beside^ that (...) may there as
well be the name of his nation, as his family; and besides that it thwarteth
the places of Jeremy and Daniell already quoted: it is diametrally opposite to
another place of the same Daniell, in his nineth Chapter, where he is called
Darius of the seed of the Medes. Of this Darius more anon when we come into
Media: As for Nabonnedus, questionless he was the same with Balthassar. For
besides that Josephus, and Berosus attribute to either of them the reign of 17
years: the same Josephus (who might best know the truth in this case) tells
us, that Balthassar was by the Babylonians, called Naboandel; a name not so
great a stranger to Nabonnedus, as Scaligers Darius, or Herodotus his
Labinitus. But in this, we must pardon Joseph: scorn and contradiction was a
part of his essence. For had he not been in some things singular; in all,
peremptory: he had neither been a Scaliger, nor the son of Julius.

After the death of Balthassar, these Provinces have hitherto followed the
fortune of the stronger potentate: as being subject to 1 The Persians. 2
Graecians. 3 Romans. 4 Persians 5 Sarracens. 6 Persian Sophies; from whom
during the Persians civil wars, Amurath the 3 Emperor of the Turks subdued
them.

OF MEDIA AND PERSIA.
MEDIA is limited on the East with Parthia, on the West with Armenia, on the
South with Persia, and on the North with the Caspian Sea. This Sea is so called
from the Caspij, a people of Scythia, whose Southern coast bordreth on this
Sea. 2ly The Hircanian Sea, of Hircania, a neighbor Province of Persia: and
now 3ly Mari d^ Bacchu of the City Bacchu s^ated nigh unto it. It is the
biggest Sea absolu^ely of all them, which have no commerce with the Ocean.

This Country is generally barren, especially in the northern parts; so that
they make their bread for the most part of dried Almonds, their drink of the
roots of certain herbs, and feed ordinarily on Venison. Yet is it not
defective in pasture grounds, here being some grassie plains of that bigness,
that 50000 horses may pasture on them. Here was that liquor called Oleum
Med^acum, with which they used to enuenome their arrows which being shot from a
slacker bow (for a swift and strong motion took its virtue from it) did burn
the flesh whereinto it fastened with great violence; and was of that nature,
that nothing could mitigate the fury of it, but dust thrown into the wound;
water rather increasing then allaying the heat and torture.

The chief Cities are Sultania, famous for the fairest Mosque of the East. 2
Symmachia, the strongest place of all Media, taken by the Turks An. 1578; and
made the seat of a Turkish Bashaw by Osman Beg, immediately after the taking of
Tauris 1585. 3 Nassivan called of old Nasuana. 4 Eres another strong piece. 5
Ardonille, the birthplace and seat of residence and dominion, to Bunie and
Aider, the first authors of the Sophian sect and Empire in Persia: and the
burial place of Ismael the first Sophie or Emperor of Persia, of this line. 6
Tabris, or Tauris, in compass 16 miles, containing in that space about 200000
inhabitants. The air hereof is very wholesome, but windy and cold; the cause
why the Persian kings made it their place of residence in the summer; as they
did Susis in the winter. This Tauris is by some supposed to be the same with
Ecbatana, and has been thrice taken by the Turks; namely, by Selimus the
first; 2 by Solomon the magnificent; 3 by Osman, General to Amurath the 3d;
who has fortified it with a Castle. 7 Seruan, whence the whole Province is
called Sh^ruan. 8 Baccu. Whence the Caspian Sea is called Mari di Baccu.

Nigh unto Media is the Country Albania, now called Zuiria, a Country little
beholding to the labor or industry of the husbandman; yet of its own accord,
yielding for one sowing most times two, sometimes three reapings. As for the
people, they greatly honor old age, but account it a soloecisme in manners, to
make any mention of the dead: and of these it is that Pliny (how truly I
know not) reports, that they are ho^^y haired from their youth and see by
night as well as by day. The chief Town is Caucasiae Portae, built hard upon
the hill Caucasus, one of the best fortefied towns of the East: it was said by
Pliny to be ingens naturae miraculum, and is now called Derbent; a strong
City, environed with two walls, and fortefied with iron gates: taken
nevertheless it was in the last wars against the Persian, and still
remains under the Turks. The chief rivers of this Province are Arasse, and
Ciro. The ancient Cities of this Country were Laodicea. 2 Apamia. 3 Rhaga, etc

PERSIA is bounded on the East with the river Indus, on the West with the
Persian Gulf, on the North with the Caspian Sea, and the river Oxus; on the
South with the maine Ocean. This Oxus is famous, first for being a bound fatal
to monarchies, as we shall tell you when we come into Tartarie: and 2ly for the
famous passage of Alexander over it. For having pursued Bessus, the murderer of
Darius, unto this river, and not knowing how to pass over it; there being
neither ships on it, nor any timber nigh at hand to build them: he caused a
great many bags and bladders to be stuffed with straw; and so on them in six
days transported his whole army. So that I may truly say with his own
historian, Vnum id consilium quod necessitas subiecerat, inijt, necessity is
the best author of inventions. The men are much addicted to hospitality, and
poetry; Lordly in their complements, fantastical in their apparel,
magnificent in expenses, lovers of learning, maintainers of Nobility, and
desirous of peace. The women are gorgeous in attire, delightsome in
sequestration of pleasure, truly loving, neat and cleanly.

Their religion is Mahumetanisme, in which they differ from the Turks about the
successors of Mahomet (as shall be showed anon) and some other circumstances;
hence the Turks reputing them schismatic, continually persecute them with
the fire and the sword. Their language is as much used in the East, as the
Latin in the West.

The Christian religion was planted here, as also in Media, Hircania, Carmania,
etc, by S. Thomas; and in other of the Provinces by S. Andrew.

This Empire contains these several Provinces.

1 PERSIS, now called Far, abounding in mettalls of Gold, Silver, and precious
stones; every where is moistened with ample lakes, and pleasant springs: a
Country fertile in all things, except fruit, which they most want; as having no
trees but Palm trees. The chief Cities are 1 Siras or Persepolis, built by
Perses, son to Perseus son to Jupiter and Danae; who also changed the name
of Elamites into that of Persians. For so we are informed by Isidor Persae
(says he) populi sunt a Perseo rego vocati, qui a Graecia Asiam transiens, ibi
barbaras gentes graui diuturnoque bello perdomuit, and victor nome^ subiectae
genti imposuit. This Persepolis was the seat royal of this Empire, for which
cause Alexander at the request of the lewd Curtizan Lais, commanded it to be
set on fire; but afterward repenting so great a folly, he reedified it. 2
Casbin, the residence of the present Sophies brought hither from Tauris by
Sophie Tamas. It is also called Hispaan, and is said to be a days journey
about on horse back. It is well walled, and fortefied with a strong fort; and
beautified with two Seraglioes, the walls whereof are made of red marble, and
paued with Mosaique work. The chief street hereof is called the Atmaidan,
being in figure fouresquare; every side a quarter of a mile in length: round
about which are scaffolds set, for the people to sit and behold the King and
his Nobles, at their exercises of shooting, running, and the like: here also
does the Sophie sometimes administer justice in person. 3 Sava. 4 Bescant. 5
Lara. Sr. W. Ral.
2 SVSIANA, or Cusestan is situate Eastward of Persis. It is so called quasi
Chushiana from Chus, the son of Him, the son of Noah; who first peopled here,
and afterward withdrew himself more Southwestward, where the three Arabians
now are, calling them the land of Chus: which are that land of Chus (our
translatours read it the land of Aethiopia) which the river Gihon is said to
encompasse, Gen, 2.13. this Gihon being indeed the more Westerly branch of the
river Emphrates. Chus being thus departed this Country, left it to his son
Hauilah; from whence it is in the Scriptures called the land of Hauilah where
there is Gold, and which the river Pison is said to compass Genesis 2.11. which
Pison is the Southern branch of the river Tigris or Hiddekel, called by
Curtius, Pisotigris, and Pasitigris; Peruenit (says he) rex ad fluvium,
Pasitigrin incolae vocant, which he presently affirms to fall into the
Persian Sea, as Tigris and Euphrates also do. Now that there was another land
of Hauilah, beside that in India, which we shall in due time mention; is
evident out of the Scriptures: for whereas Saul smote the Amalechites from Sur
to Hauilah, 1. Sam. 15.7. certainly it must be understood of this Hauilah or
Susiana, being the Eastern bound of that nation; and not of Hauilah in India;
it being no where found that Saul was so great a traveler. The chief Cities
hereof are 1 Susa, where the ancient Persian Princes used to keep Court in time
of winter, as being more Southerly then Ecbatana, 2 Saum. 3 Casa. 3 CARMANIA is
situate on the East of Susiana. The chief Cities are 1 Gad^l. 2 Cobinum. 3
Caramania, (now, as also the Province, called Chyrman) famous for cloth of
Gold, and the best Scimitars; Adrianus.
a weapon of such value amongst the Mahumetaus; that at the overthrow of the
Turkish Navy at Lepanto, the Turks which were taken prisoners, cast their
Seimitars into the Sea, least the Christians should get into their power such
excellent weapons. Plutarch.
In this Country it was that Alexander being returned out of India, kept his
Bacchanalia, in imitation of Bacchus, who had first conquered that nation,
Night and day he was continually feasting with his friends, on a scaffold
drawn with 8 horses; his companions following in their chariots, some adorned
with purple and silk, others with flowers and green boughs, themselves
wearing garlands on their heads, and carrying their carowsing cups in their
hands. In this army there was neither helm, sword, arrow, or buckler seene^ al
their armor was cups, barrells, and flaggons; their skirmishing, eating,
drinking, laughing, and singing. Attended they were by minstrells, playing on
their Flutes, by women dancing, boys shooting, all playing the drunken fools
most naturally. Thus marched they through the Country of Carmania, in as great
dissoluteness, as if Bacchus himself indeed had been there, and lead the
mummery; and for seven whole days this sottishnes continued. So that Curtius
well observes: Si quid victis saltem aduersus comessantes animi fuisset, mill
hercule viri, modo and sobrij, septem dierum crapula graves in suo triumpho
capere potuerun^; a thousand sober men of the Persians, had their hearts been
answerable to the occasion, might have defeated this drunken army, and
recovered the liberty of their Country. 4 GEDROSIA confineth Eastward on
Carmania, Plutarch.
and extends to the river Indus. The chief City is Gedroson. In this
Country it was that Alexander placed the monument of his Indian conquest. For
intending to make his name immortal among that barbarous people, he made on
the Western bank of Indus (which is in Gedrosia the form of a camp;
enlarged it with greater Cabbins then were sufficient for a man to lodge in;
and builded in it higher mangers then horses could feed in. He caused also
armours to be made of bigger proportion then his Soldiers bodies; and Bits for
horses of extraordinary compass and length; all which he scattered about his
Camp for the savage people in time to come to wonder at. All that he did in
this was, the occasioning of a suspicion in many understanding men, that his
actions were less then it is thought; since he labored so earnestly to make
them thought more then they were. 5 DRANGIANA lies Northward to Gedrosia:
Ptolomie.
the chief Cities are 1 Timocani, 2 Sishan (formerly Prolasia)* 3 Sige,
whence the whole Province is now named Sigeshan. 4 Mulebet where Aladine, a
seditious Persian, made a terrestrial Paradise, which he promised to al his
Partisans: but the company growing too great for the safety of the kingdom,
they were al quickly dispersed; and Aladine with his fools Paradise both taken
away together. Some attribute this fiction of Paradise to Aladeules the
mountaine-King of Anti Taurus, vanquished by Sel^m the first. The whole story
is thus: Aladine inhabited a vallie in this Country, Paul. Venet.
the entrance into which he fortified with a strong Castle called Tigado.
Hither he brought all the lusty youths, and beautiful maidens of the
adjoining Provinces* The women were confined to their chambers, the men to
prison; where having endured much sorrow, they were severally cast into dead
sleeps, and conveyed to the women, where they were entertained with all the
pleasures youth and lust could desire, or a sensual mind affect. Having
inioyed this happiness a whole day, they were in a like sleep convaied to
their irons. Then would Aladine inform them how they had been in Paradise,
and that he could seat them there eternally, if they durst hazard their lives
in his quarrels. This when they had sworn to do, they were destinated to the
massacre of such Princes, as were like to prove his bad neighbors; and they
accordingly did execution. These men the Italians call Assassines (whence we
use the phrase to Assassinate) the name importing as much as thieves or
cutthroats: such a one was he who murdered the Count to Tripolis in the wars
for the holy land; and such a one was he who so desperately wounded our Edward
the first, at the siege of Ptolemais or Acon. 6 ARIA is situate North on
Drangiana, it is now called Sargulzar, the chief City being called Aria. The
people of this Country having rebelled against Alexander, were by him
vanquished; and compelled to hide themselves in a Cave, situate on the top of
an inaccessible rock; and with small strength easily defended. But to
Alexander nothing was impossible, for he piling up a great mass of timber even
with the caves mouth when the wind conveniently served, set it on fire. By
this device the Cave was filled so full of heat and smoke, that most were
stifled, some half burnt, and the rest contented to yield to the Victors
mercy. In this Country also it was that Philotas his treason against Alexander
was discovered, and himself accordingly rewarded. Finally, of this Country
Satibarzanes was governor, who reuolting from Alexander, and joining battles
with him, boldly challenged any of Alexanders Captains. This challenge was
accepted by Eriguis, an aged, but spiritfull Soldier; who speaking alowd,
quales milites Alexander habeat ostendam, gave the onset, and at the second
venew slew him. After whose death the Arians returned to their obedience. 7
ARACHOSIA is Eastward on Drangiana. Hereabouts the mountain Taurus is called
Caucasus, on which vinctum Promethea fuisse antiquitas tradit, says the
Historian. Prometheus is indeed by the Poets sained to have stolen fire from
heaven, and to have made a man of clay: for which presumptuous fact, Jupiter
bound himon the hill Caucasus; where a vulture continually fed on his Liver.
But according either to the truth of story, or their guess at least, who make
some story the ground of every Fable; Prometheus being a very wise man,
instructed the dead and clayie carcasses of others with wisdom: and that being
very desirous to learn the nature of the stars, (which is the fire he stole
from heaven) he made the highest part of Mount Caucasus his study: where the
inward care he had to accomplish his desire, might justly have bin compared to
a vulture gnawing on his entrails; and of this opinion is S. Augustine. The
chief cities of this Country are 1 Sin, 2 Cabul, called anciently Alexandria,
or (for distinctions sake) Alexandria Arachosiae. It was built by Alexander, at
the foot of the hill Caucasus, and made a Macedonian Colonie; here being 7000
old Macedonian soldiers left by him to people and inhabit it. The whole
Country is called now by the new name of the town Cabul. 8 PARAPOMISVS is
North to Arachosia, it took its name from the mountain Taurus, which
extending it self through all Asia, is called according to the diversity of
places after diverse names; and in these parts. Parapomisus. A mountainous and
hilly Country it is, scarce known in the time of Alexander to its next
borderers: at what time the people were so rude, that the barbarous Nations
their neighbors held them not worthy their acquaintance. Agreste hominum
genus, and inter Barbaros maxim inconditum, says Curtius. The hills were high
and barren, the valleys indifferently fruitful, but so shadowed with the
mountains, that their clearest day was but a twilight. Their buildings were
base and low, their villages small and beggarly: Their chief town is now
callrd Candatura, a well frequented market. 9 SACA lies yet more North on the
borders of Scythia, the people hereof called the Sacae, were the progenitors
of the Saxons; who leaving their country, seated themselves in the North part
of Germany: where they increased both in multitude and valor, growing a
terror to their neighbors. The people of this Country live yet in a barbarous
fashion, having neither town, nor house; but living in caves, and making theft
their best calling. 10 HIRCANIA is situate somewhat Eastward from Sacae, and
bordereth Northward on the Hircanian or Caspian Sea. The whole Province is
nothing but a continued Forest in a manner; and so Alexander when he conquered
this Country found it. For the Hircanians so tied the boughs and spriggs of
the trees together, that it was impossible for Alexander to come at them, till
with incredible pains to his soldiers, he had caused the wood to be cut
down: at sight of which, the people whose hope was, that the Kings more
earnest affairs would not license him to stay so long about the enterprise;
yielded themselves. These Forests give lurking holes to infinite numbers of
Tigers, celebrated in all Writers for their horrible fierceness; whence it
grew to a common adage concerning cruel men, that they had sucked a Hircanian
Tiger.
Hircanaeque admorunt ubera Tigres.
The chief cities hereof, are Telebrota, 2 Samariana, 3 Carta, and 4 No^barea,
once honored with an Oracle. The chief rivers in all these Provinces are
Bundimire and Ilment, 3 Sirto, and 4 Hidero* with diverse others; some of which
have so s^eep a fall into the sea, that under the waters the people resort to
sacrifice or banquet; the stream shooting violently over their heads without
wetting of them. Particularly the river Zioberis in Hircania, is most famous;
which rising out of the hills of that Country, and having run a long continued
course, hides his waters under the earth for the space of 38 miles, and rises
again into the river Rodagho, an other river of that Country also. It is said
that Alexander made trial of the truth hereof, by casting into the water two
oxen, whom the stream at its own rising cast up again.

The Medes so called of Madai the son of Iaphet, were subdued by Ninus, the
3d Monarch of the Assyrian^: under whose command they long continued faithful,
till the degenerate life of Sardanapalus, incited Belochus governor of
Babylon, and Arbaces Lieftenant-generall in Media, and the adjoining Region, to
lay a foundation of their own future greatness. The disposer of kingdoms suited
their thoughts with an end answerable to their desires. Belochus retained
Assyria; and Arbaces is inthronized in the maiesticall palace of the Medes.

The Monarchs of the Medes.
3146 1 Arbaces, (in whose time Phidon an Argiue, found out the use of weights
and measures) was the founder of the Median Monarchy. 3174 2 Madanes. 50 3224
3 Sosarmus. 30 3254 4 Medsdus. 25 3279 5 Cardicceas. 13 3292 6 Deiocis, who
founded Ecbatana. 17 3309 7 Pha^r^^s a man of great prowess and fortune: he
made all Asia stand in fear, and compelled the Persians to be his tributaries.
22 3331 8 Cya^xes united to his Empire the Saracens, and the Parthians. This
King was so ouer-laid by the Scythians, who in the reign of Phaortes had broke
into Media, that he was little better then their rent-gatherer. But having
endured them for above two years, he plotted their final extirpation, and
committed his design to the nobles, who willingly gave ear to it. One night
they invited the chief of the Scythians to a banquet, where having well
liquor'd them, and put them all to the sword; the baser sort willingly returned
homewards. 40 3371 9 Astiages, who having married his daughter Mandanes to
Cambises King of Persia, Justin.
dreamed that she had made so much water, as drowned all Asia: hereupon he
commanded Harpagus one of his Noblemen to see the Child killed; but he loathing
so cruel a fact, committed the charge of executing the Kings Commandment, to
Mithridates the Kings heard-man. He preserved the life of the young infant,
whose fortune at last lifted him up to the Persian Monarchy; when abhorring
his Grandfather for that intended cruelty, he both bereft him of his kingdom,
and confined him to Hircania, when he had reigned 35 years, A.M. 3406. 3406 10
Cyaxares, son to Astiages, of the age of 52 years, succeeded his father. For
Cyrus pretending no quarrel to his Uncle, who had never wronged him; left unto
him the Kingdom of Media, and took unto himself the sovereignty of Persia,
which before was tributary to the Medes.
At this division of the Median Empire, as Torniellus in his Annals, (and that
not improbably) is of opinion, it was also agreed on, that Cyrus should take
the daughter and only child of Cyaxares to wife; that they should both join
together in subduing of their neighbors; that whatsoever they won, should
then belong to Cyaxares, (who was even then an old Prince) during his life;
and that Cyrus should be his heir. In the twentieth year of their several
reigns, they took Babylon, slew Baltazar, and destroyed the Empire of the
Chaldeans. This action, the Scriptures attribute wholly to Cyaxares (who is by
them called Darius Medus) whereof S. Hierome alleges three reasons, 1o ordo
aetatis, 2o regni, 3o propinquitatis: 1 Darius was older, 2ly the Empire of the
Medes was more famous then that of the Persians; and 3ly the Uncle ought to be
preferred before the Nephew. We may add to these three, the composition
aboue-mentioned, made between these Princes, at the beginning of their divided
reigns. The Greek Writers attribute the victory only to Cyrus, and that on
three reasons also. 1 the Persians desirous to magnify Cyrus their own
Countryman, gave him all the glory of the action; and from the Persians the
Greeks had it. Secondly, Cyrus only was employed in the siege, ( Darius then
being absent) and by his valor and conduct, was the Empire of the Chaldaeans
ruined: and thirdly Darius lived not fully two years after this great
victory, so that before remote Nations had taken notice of the conquest, Cyrus
was in the Throne. Josephus only in the II Chapter of his 10 Book, cutteth
the thread even between these two Princes, and tells us that Darius with his
allie Cyrus, destroyed the estate of the Babylonians. That this Darius Medus of
Daniel, is the Cyaxares of the Greeks, is more then manifest. For Josephus in
the place aboue-cited tells us, (...); that he was Astiages son, and is
otherwise called by the Greeks: now ask the Greeks what was the name of
Astiages son; and Xenophon will tell you, that it was Cyaxares. As for the
name of Nabon^edus, which Joseph Scaliger in spite of reason, and the whole
world of Chronologers, would thrust upon this Darius Medus: we have already
refelled it, though we are not ignorant, that Helvicus, and Calvisius, two
worthy Writers, have followed him as in all his Can^n, so also in this
particular error. After the death of this Cyaxares, Cyrus succeeded in his
Throne, and the Empire of the Medes was incorporate into that of the Persians.

The Monarchy of the Persians.
3406 1 Cyrus having vanquished Astiages, united to his Empire of Persia, the
Countries of Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, Arabia, and also the Mona^chy of the
Assyrians: after which victories he was slain by Tomiris a Queen of Scythia.
This Cyrus is magnified by Xenoph^n, as Aeneas by Virgil, Ulysses by Homer. ^9
3435 2 Cambises subdued Psamniticus the last King of Egypt, which Country he
united to his own Empire. He having a mind to marry his own sister, was told
by the Wisemen, that they knew no law admitting such a conjunction, but that
there was a law, that the Persian Kings might do what they listed. This King
was a very bloody Tyran.
The inter-regnum of the Magi.
Herodotus.
Cambises at his expedition into Egypt, constituted Patizithes one of the
Magi, Viceroy in his absen^e, He hearing of the kings death, conferred the
Kingdom on his own son Smerdis, making the people believe that he was the
brother of Cambises: A matter of no difficulty, considering how retirement
from the public view, was a chie^e point of the Persian majesty. But the
Nobles either knowing the true Smerdis to be slain, or suspecting the
overmuch retirednes of the new king, began to search out the matter. Otanes
had a daugther, which was one of the kings concubines; her he commanded when
the King took next his pleasure with her, she should feel whether he had any
cares, for Cambises (in I know not what humor) had cut off the ears of this
Magus. This commandment she obeying, found out the falsehood. The seven
Princes informed of this imposture, join together, and slew this
Pseudo-Smerdis in the 8 month of his reign. This done, to avoid contention,
they agreed among themselves, that the seven Princes meeting in the palace
green, should acknowledge him for King, whose horse before the rising of the
Sun, first neighed. The evening before the day appointed, Darius horse-keeper
brought his masters horse into the green, together with a ma^e which the horse
then covered. In the morning the Princes met, and Darius horse knowing the
place, and missing his mare, neighed lustily; and the Princes presently
acknowledge Darius king.

The restoring of the Kingdom.
3443 3 Darius Histaspis, one of the seven Persi^n Princes or Governors, thus
elected King, took Babylon (which had revolted) by the ingenious fetches of
Zopirus, and overcame all Asia, and Greece. He is called in the Bible
Ahasuerus, and had for his second wi^e Hester 36 3479 4 Xerxes to revenge the
overthrow at Marathron, attempted to subdue the Greeks: by whom he was
overthrown in the navall battle of Salamis; and that famous and honorable
exploit of the Grecians at Thermopilae. 21. 3500 5 Artaxerxes Longinanus was he
who sent Esdras to rebuild the Temple of the Lord; and received Themistocles
being banished from Athens 44 3544 6 Darius Nothus 19, in whose time Egypt
revolted. 3563 7 Ar^axerxes Mnemon. 36 3599 8 Ochus surpassing Cambises in
tyrauny, first slew his two brothers, then recovered Egypt, subdued Cyrus,
Iudaea, and Syria. 26 3625 9 Arsames slain villainously by the Eunuch Bagoas;
lest he should revenge the death of his Father, whom this Bagoas had also
slain 4 3629 10 Darius Governor of Armenia, was by the means of Bagoas made
sole Monarch of Persia: he was overthrown by Alexand^r the Great in three
battles, viz: of Granucins, of Cilicia, and of Arvela: and so the Empire of the
Medes and Persians was transferred to the Macedonians, A.M. 3625.
The certain revenues of this Monarchy seem to have been 1456 Talents; for so
much the last Darius yearly received. What the casual revenues were, is
doubtful; though manifest it is that they far exceeded the certain. For 1
the Persian Monarchs were Kings of 127 Provinces: Secondly, Darius offered to
Alexander for the ransom of his mother and two daughters, 30000 talents of
gold* Thirdly, Alexander found in the treasury of Damascus 2600 talents; in
that of Susa 50000 talents of gold uncoined, in that of Pasargadis, 6000
talents, in that of Echbatana 26000 talents; in that of Persepolis 120000
talents; in all 204600 talents, besides the infinite riches of the treasury of
Babylon, yielded into his hands by Bag^phanes, and other places of note, not
particularly specified, a h^ge and unspeakable sum. Fourthly, in that the gold
and riches which Alexander, now a conqueror, sent from Persia to Macedon and
Greece, (besides that which every Captain and common Soldier had provided and
laid up for his own maintenance) loaded 10000 Mules, and 5000 Camels.

After this overthrow of the Persian Monarchy, this nation lay obscure 535
years, viz: from the year 3635 year of the world, to the 228 year of
Christ: of which time they were 83 years under the Syrian successors of
Alexander; and 452 years under the Arsacidan kings of Parthia* (...) etc. For
after Darius had lost his kingdom to Alexander the Macedonian, and after the
Victor himself was dead also, the more potent Captains divided Asia among
them. But discords daily arising, and the Macedonian puissance by these often
broils not smally broken; Arsaces one of the Parthian nobility, persuaded the
barbarous people of the East, and among them the Persians, to cast off the
Greek yoke, and stand for their liberty: he himself taking upon him the
title of King, and investing himself with a Diadem, A.M. 3718. The Persian^
by this revolt, got little or nothing, having indeed not changed the tyranny,
but the tyrant: yet under the Parthian government they continued till A.C. 228
At that time the Parthians having been barbarously by Caracalla massacred, and
after, in a battle, which continued three days, shrewdly broken by Macrinus,
(as there we shall more fully inform you:) Artaxerxes a generous minded
Persian, his name (no doubt) suggesting high thoughts unto him; husbanded this
opportunity so well, that he slew Artabanus the last king of Parthia, and once
more brought the royal seat into Persia. Yet was not this so easily effected,
the Parthians notwithstanding their ^ormer losses, maintaining a cruel fight
for three days together: so difficult was it to vanquish that nation, when
their forces were broken; impossible, when they were whole. Artaxerxes, proud
of this success, sent a peremptory embassy unto Alexander Severus, the then
Roman Emperor, to have all the Provinces in Asia, which had formerly belonged
to the Persian Monarchy, re-deliuered unto him a matter not so easily granted
as demanded. For Severus to suppress so insolent an enemy, marched toward
Persia with an Army Romanly appointed; which, to find his enemy more work,
h^e divided into three parts: whereof the first was appoin^ed ^o march into
M^diz; the second into Parthia; the third, himself led in the midway between
both; to succor both as occasion required. This device succeeded not happily;
for his two first Armies being by the Persians broken, he with much danger and
haste, retired back with the third. This was a good beginning for the Persian
Empire, the establishment followed not long after; Aurelianus the Emperor
being vanquished and taken prisoner by Sapores the second King of this race; so
that now the name of the Persian grew so terrible to the Romans, that
Constantine the Great transplanted all the Colonies and Garrisons of the
North-west parts of the Empire, into the East; to keep the Persians from
growing too far upon the Roman Provinces: and removed also the seat of the
Empire nigher unto them, from Rome to Constantinople. And thus having shown
you the beginning and establishment, the foundation and building of the new
kingdom of the Persians; take along with you the Catalogue of their Kings,
until they once more lost the sovereignty of their own Nation, and became
slaves again. The second race of the Persian Kings.

who being vanquished by Haumar and his Saracens, Anno 634; buried the glory of
this renowned Nation, in the grave of oblivion and infamy.

The Saracenicall Caliphs, having added this kingdom to their huge Empire,
appointed here their Deputies, whom they honored with the name of Sultan or
Sold^ns; which were for a long tract of time, true receivers and repayers of
the profits and intrado, due to their Emperors or Caliphs. At last Mahomet a
Persian Sultan, intending to shake off the decaying command of the Babylonian
Caliph, and not being able to compass so great a design, without the
assistance of a foreign power; called the Turks to his succor: by whose
means he overthrew Pisafiris the Caliph; and denying the Turks leave to
return home, compelled them to seek their own s^fety, in the ruin of him
and his new kingdom; into which succeeded Tangrolipix the Turkish Captain,
Anno 1030.

after whose death, the more potent Princes seized on the chief parts of the
Kingdom. In this confused Anarchie it remained, till the Tartarians burning in
civil dissension; gave a kind opportunity to Gempsas a Parthi^n Sultan, to
free his own subjects and the Persians from the Tartarian bondage: who entered
severally with an Army royal into the country, which he quickly made his own;
the competitors in this common danger, neither, laying aside their private
hatreds, nor so much as joining together in counsel to gi^e him resistance;
but severally fighting, were all vanquished. This effected, he was with a
general consent both of the Commons and Nobility, chosen Sultan or King of
Persia.
The fifth race, or Parthian Kings of Persia.
1450 1 Gemsas, Sultan of Parthia. His issue did not long enjoy the Persian
Monarchy: for Tamberlan like a violent whirlewinde, driving all the East before
him, dispossessed the Parthian race of Persia, leaving it to his son. But
Philosophy teaches us, that no violent motion is of long continuance; and
policy may instruct us, that a kingdom forced to bow under a populous army, is
not so established to its ouer-runner; but that the fury of the war once
past, it may and does recover its former liberty: like a reed or tender plant,
which yields to a furious wind; but the storm once ouer-blowne, it
recouereth its former straightness. So fared it with the Tartarians, for not
long after the death of Tamberlane, the Parthian race recovered this kingdom,
the last of which line was 2 Malaoncres, overcome in fight by 1453 3 Vssan
Cussanes, a Prince of the Armenians. 4 Iacup. During the reign of these two
latter kings, happened this memorable alteration of Religion and state in ^ersia.
Mahomet the Law giver of the Saracens, by his last Will and Testament,
bequeathed to his cosen Hali, being the husband to his daughter Fatime, all his
estate, with the title of Caliph: but Abubezer, Haumar, and Osmen, three
powerful men of Arabia, and great assistants to Mahomet, successively followed
one another in the Caliphate. After their death, Hali hoped a more comfortable
Sun would shine upon his sincere proceeding; but Mnavias a valiant man of
war obtained that dignity; and to hinder all future claims, slew Hali with
his son Ossan, and 11 of the sons of this Ossan, the twelfth escaping with
life. From this twelfth son, by name Musa Ceresin, one Guine Sophie derived
his pedigree, Anno 1360; and considering that now there had no Caliph been in
long time, began to contriue the establishing of that honorable estate, in his
own family: but he leaving this life, left also the rude lump of his begun
proiects, to be licked over with the industry of his son Aider Sophie: He
being a man of great sanctity and much power, as fortified with the surest
bulwark, viz: the constant affection of the people; was thought by Vssan
Cussanes, a husband worthy of his daughter. But Iacup his son and successor,
seeing the glory of this sun, to obscure the lesser lamp of his reputation;
and fearing what he could do, not what he would, cau^ed him to be slain: and
delivered Ismael and Solomon his two sons to Amazar one of his Captains, to
cast them in prison. Amazar of a more ingenious disposition, afforded them not
only liberty, but also good education: insomuch that Ismael Sophie, a towardly
young gentleman, vowed revenge for the death of his father; which vow he
fulfilled, having overcame and slain King Iacup, and his son Elvan. After
this victory, he being crowned King or Sophie, or Shangh of Persia, altered the
form of Religion, making Hali and himself the true successors of Mahomet:
but condemning Ab^bezer, Haumar, and Osmen, with the Turks, as rebels and
Schisma^icks. Hence proceeded the diverse iarres, which to the Persians loss
have happened between them and the Turks; the Persians burning whatsoever book
or monument they find concerning those three; and the Turks holding it more
meritorious to kill one Persian, then 70 Christians. Surius in his
Commentaries, writing purposely the acts of this Ismael, says; that the Jews
on some fond conceit, were strongly persuaded that he was their Messiah: but it
proved quite contrary, there never being man that more vexed and grieved them,
then he.

The compass of this Sophian Empire, is, or was before the avulsion of the two
Provinces, 4560 miles; being of equal length and breadth; every side of which
quadrangle extended it self 1140 miles.

The revenues in the days of Sophie Tamas, amounted to 4 or 5 millions of
gold; which he, by doubling the value of his coin, raised to 8 millions; but
now they are much diminished; and the Turk having gotten from them so much
ground, as is divided into 40000 Timariots, and receiving the yearly income of
one million.

Thus much of the Persian State.

OF PARTHIA.
PARTHIA is bounded on the East with Aria, on the West with Media, on the North
with Hiroania, and on the South with Charmania. It is now called Erach.

The chief cities are 1 Guerde, 2 Iesdi, 3 Hispaa, (formerly Hircatompile) of
that bigness, that the Persians call it hyperbolically, Half the world. 4
Tigranocerta, built by Tigranes King of Armenia. 5 Ctesiphon the royal seat of
the Arsacides: a Town diverse times besieged by the Roman Emperors, but most
commonly without success. Under the walls of this Town died Julian the
Apostata, a bitter enemy to the Faith of Christ. For though he was no open
persecutor, yet he forbade the Christians the use of profane learning:
thinking the prohition of that, to be the principal means to weaken the
Faith of Christ; the use whereof our modern Schismatickes think to be the
only hinderance of the enlargement of the number of the faithful. Not
considering how that confutation is most powerful, which is drawn from the
doctrine and tenets of our adversaries: nor calling to mind how S. Paul in his
Epistles, cites in the first of Titus, Epimenides; in the 17th of the Acts,
Aratus; and in the first and 15th of the Corinths, the Poet Euripides. But see,
the ungodly policy of this Emperor, has drawn me out of my way. I return.

Iustine.
The Parthians are descended from the Scythians, (whose language, though
somewhat mixed with the Median tongue, they yet retain) who being banished
their native soil, peopled these parts, and were called Parthians, i. ^ Exles.
A rude people they were, and so base, that none of Alexanders Captain; would
vouchsafe to be their king. At last they were brought to a civil conformity of
manners, apparel, and warlike discipline, by their first King Arsaces; in
honor of whom all their Kings were called Arsacides, as the Roman Emperors
Caesar's; the Egyptian Kings Pharaohs, and Ptolomies. At the first rising of
this A^saces, Seleuc^^ Callenicus King of Syria, under whose Empire they were,
made head against him^ but Arsaces was victorious; since which victory, the
Parthians kept the day whereon it was won, as festival; that being the first
day of their liberty and reputation.

This people were much addicted to shooting with bows, and profited in this
exercise so well, that they were accounted the most expert Archers in the
World. Hence was it that M. Crassus in his expedition against them, being told
by an Astrologer, that his journey would prove disastrous, because the Sun
had some evil aspect in Scorpio: cried, tush, tush, I fear not Scorpio, but
Sagittarius. They used to fight most when they retired, making their retreat
more dismal then the onset: Shooting sometimes from between their legs,
sometimes backwards, Terga conversi metuenda Parthi, (as Seneca says.)
Certainly the Air and Earth seem to have combined together to make them
expert in archery and horsemanship. Dion.
Caelum enim quod siccum est, nervos intentos facit, regio tota plana est, and
ob eam rem equis accommodata: the air being dry, seasoneth their strings; and
the Country plain, exercises their horse. Next the Parthians, I am persuaded
that the English have bin reputed the best bow-men; these having gotten as many
noble victories over the French, as ever the other did over the Roman. At this
time archery is euery-where neglected, the gunne silencing all former offensive
weapons, but how justly I know not: it is a disputation above my moderating,
Sir John Smith, and Sir Roger Williams having defended their several parts in
it, and many good judgments siding with the one and the other. I come now to
the Kings.

The Kings of Parthia.
A.M. 3718 1 Arsaces 23 3741 2 Mi^hridates 20 3761 3 Pampatius 12 3773 4
Pharnaces 8 3781 5 Mithridates II subdued Media: 6 Phraortes. Freigius.
3857 7 Artabanus 8 Mithridates III 3903 Herodes, who vanquished Crassus, and
slew 20000 Romans, and because Crassus was so covetous, he caused molten gold
to be powered down his throat. This disgrace was after revenged by Ventidius,
Dio^.
Mark Antonies Lieftenant, the first man that ever triumphed over the
Parthians; of whom he slew a great number, and amongst the rest Pacorus the
Kings son. The day of the battle being the same in which Crassus had
formerly bin discomfited. Ventidius after this victory, was in fair
possibility to have ruined his kingdom, or at least shrewdly shaken it; had
not Antonie in an envious humor, called him from that service. Finally Herodes
was slain by his son Phraortes. 10 Phraartes II a valiant Prince, but wicked
and cruel, against him marched Marcus Antonius with a populous army, which
wa^ted little of an absolute overthrow: of 16 legions scarce six returned home
in safety. This King submitted himself and Kingdom unto Augustus, restoring
the Roman ensigns, and freeing the Captives taken at the defeat of Crassus.
The only mark of the Parthians subjection, was their receiving Kings at the
appointment of the Senate and Emperors of Rome, which also lasted not long.
Four Kings of the Arsacidan stock succeeded, viz: 11 Phaartes, 12 Orodes, 13
Vonon, 14 Tiridite^* who was dispossessed of his kingdom and life, by
Artabanus a stranger to the blood. ^ Artabanus the first King of the Parthians,
not being of the Arsacidan line. 2 Bardanes, 3 Goterzes, 4 Vonones, 5
Vologeses, 6 Artabanus II, 7 Pacorus, 8 Cosroes, 9 Parnaspates, 10 Vologeses
II, 11 Vologeses III. 12 Artabanus the last King of Parthia, whose ouer-throw
by the valor of Artaxerxes, the first Persian king of the second race, was the
period of this flourishing estate; which in her chiefest glory was the sole
Lady of 18 subordinate Kingdoms.
Heredotus.
This subversion of the Parthian state, as it was primarily wrought by the
irresistable power of Heaven; so may we refer it, as to a second cause unto
the barbarous massacre of this people by Antoninus Caracalla, and a quarrel
thence arising, Caracalla having negotiated a marriage with this Artabanus
daughter, and going to solemnize the nuptials, was met by the old King;
accompanied with the flower of his soldiers, people, and nobles, in their
triumphall ornaments. No sooner was this honorable retinue come nigh his
Army, but the watch word given, the Roman soldiers (according to their
Emperors directions) put them all to the sword; the King himself hardly
escaping with life. Caracalla being dead, Macrinus his successor was assaulted
by the reenforced Parthians, who after a three-dayes battle, hearing how
Caracalla had bin slain by Macrinus, made peace with him, there having been
in these 3 days business, great loss on both sides: so that it was now no
mastery for the Persians to surprise a kingdom thus weakened, and unable to
make resistance.

Parthia thus conquered, Anno 228, continued a member of the Persian Monarchy,
till the ouer-throw of Ormusda the last of the second race: when this Country
falling together with Persia into the hands of the Caliphs, had her proper
Sultans. Ao 1350, Gempsas a Sultan of this Country, recovered the reputation
of the Parthians, by subduing the Persians, as we have told you: and together
with Persia, it is now subject to the Sophios.

Thus much of Parthia.

OF TARTARIA.
Maginus.
TARTARIA is bounded on the East with the Eastern Ocean, on the West with
Muscouie, and Moldauia; on the North with the Scythicke, or frozen Ocean; and
on the south with Mare Caspium, the hill Taurus, and the wall of China.

This Country extends it self from East to West, 5400 miles; and from North
to South, 3600 miles.

This Country was of old known by the name of Scythia; whose inhabitants were
the posterity of Magog, the son of Iaphet; called first Magogins afterward
Scythes from Scythus their first King. The several inhabitants were first
Essedones, men who rejoiced most at their parents deaths; of whose heads trimly
wrought, and rounded with Gold, they used to make their carowsing cups. 2
Agathyrsi, who used to paint themselves; every one the more noble he was, the
more deformed and stained: for which cause, some have conceited our Pictes, to
have drawn their original from hence. 3 Nomades, who having no houses, used
there to abide longest, where the fodder for their cattle was best; which being
once consumed, they departed. 4 Axiacae, who were very valiant, but withal
barbarous and inhumane; using in their wars to drink the blood of him whom
they first slew, even as it distilled out of his wounds. 5 Geloni, who used to
apparel themselves with the skins of their enemies heads; and their horses
with the skin of their bodies. and 6 Neuri, of whom (believe it who list) it
is reported, that they could turn themselves into Wolves, and anon again
resume their true being.

The Country by reason of the many rivers running through and sometimes
ouerflowing it; was very abundant in grass: but in fuel so deficient, that
their fires were made of bones, instead of wood. This name of Scythia extending
it self into Europe, even unto all regions lying North from Danubius, called
also Sarmatia, and Scythia Europaea: and so populous has it always been*
that it is by diverse authors styled the mother of all inundations, vagina
gentium, and officina genoris humani. From hence indeed Hunns, Herules, Franks,
Bulgarians,
Circassians, Sueues, Burgundians, Turks, Tartarians,
Dutch, Cimbers, Normans, Almaines, Ostrogothes,
Tigurins, Lombards, Vandals, Visigothes:
Have swarmed like Locusts round about this ball,
And spoiled the fairest Provinces of all.
As she was populous, so were the people also valourous. They thrice ouerranne
all Asia, overcame the Egyptians, Parthians, Medes, Heredotus
and Persians; these last by the hands of a woman, viz: Tomyris: who to revenge
the death of her son Spargapises slain by Cyrus, encountered him in open field,
cut of 200000 of his men, and chopping off his head threw it into a cauldron of
blood saying, Satia te sanguine quem sitisti. Darius the successor of
Cambises, either to revenge this overthrow, or to get reputation, or to
requite a former incursion of this people into Asia, in the time of Cyarxes
which we before have mentioned; entered with a huge army: but with little
honor and less safety, as we shall anon perceive. These were the only armies
that ever were brought into Scythia, no potentate after this daring to enter
the Country in hostile manner. Consent of time.


The Kings of Scythia.
1 Scytha. 2 Napis. 3 Phitro. 4 Sagillus. 5 Targitaus. 6 Plinos. 7 Scolopithus.
8 Panaxagora. 9 Tanais. 10 Indathirsus. 11 Saulius. 12 Spargapisis. 13 Tomyris.
14 Aripethes. 15 Sciles. 16 Octomasades. 17 Lanthinus, in whose time the
Persian king Darius leading an Army of 700000 men, was vanquished by the
Amazons, Hircanians, and other nations of Scythia. The whole narration is thus.
Darius on the causes lately mentioned, intended an expedition into Scythia:
from which neither the example of Cyrus, nor any reason could dissuade him. For
his better iournying, he built a bridge over Thracius Bosphorus, and another
over Ister; about that place where it parts Bulgaria from Moldauia. To the
keepers of this last bridge he left a cord having in it sixty knots; willing
them every day to untie one of them, and if he returned not till the knots were
all untied, he licenced them to depart. This done he marches up into the
Country, the Scythians still flying before him, and leading him into the most
desert and vnuitualed parts of the Country. When they had him at this pinch,
they sent to him an Ambassador with a bird, a mouse, a frogge, and a handful
of arrows, b^dding the Persians, if they could, to read them that riddle; and
departed. Darius coniectured that the Scythians had submitted themselves, by
delivering into his hands their Earth, Air, Water, and Arms; hieroglyphically
specified in their present. But Gobrias one of the seven Princes gave this
interpretation. O ye Persians, unless ye can like a Bird fly through the
air, like a Frog swim through the water, or like a Mouse make your way under
the earth; ye can by no means escape the Scythian Arrows. Indeed this
commentary agreed best with the text: for the Scythians following him, or
rather driving him before them, cut off many thousands of his Army.
There was a long controversy between the Egyptians and those people for
antiquity; which was at last pronounced to belong to the Scythian* with this
verdict, Scytharum gens semper antiquissima. Anacharsis the Philosopher was of
this country.

There were diverse other Kings of Scythia, whose names lie obscured for want of
a Historiographer: And now the very name of Scythia is extinct.

As for the Tartars, they are by some supposed to be the offspring of the ten
Tribes, whom Salmanassar led away captive; and that especially for two reasons.
Breerwood
The first is, that the word Tatari (by which name they rather ought to be
called, then by that of Tartari) signifies in the Syriacke and Hebrew tongues,
a remnant. To this we answer, that the name of this people is derived from the
river Tartar, as some; or from the region called Tartar, where they first
dwelt, as most think: and again that though the Hebrew word (...) signify a
remnant, yet can it not be properly applied to the Tartars, who so infinitely
exceed the Jews, that they cannot be thought to be a remainder of them. 2ly
They allege for proof, that this people use circumcision, the character of
the Jewish nation. To this we reply that circumcision was common to many
people besides the Jews, as to the Egyptians, Aethiopians, etc. and that
rather as a national custom, then a religious ordinance: and again that the
Tartars cannot be proved to have received circumcision, before they received
Mahumetanisme. 3ly There is brought to confirm this opinion, a place of
Esdras, chap. 13. lib. 2. where it is said, that the ten Tribes (that they
might the better keep Gods statutes) passed over the river Euphrates, and
after a iourny of a year and a half, came into a country called Arsareth.
This we refell by showing the impossibilities; for the Tartars (when their name
was first known) were mere Idolaters, had no remembrance of the law, observed
not the Sabbath, nor any other points of the Jewish religion: and so the ten
Tribes retired not hither to keep Gods statutes. 2ly Euphrates lies quite
West from Assyria, and those places to which Salmanassar transplanted the
Israelites; and so it could not be passed over in a journey toward the North.
And 3ly it is very improbable that the ten Tribes should either be so simple,
as to leave Assyria where they were peaceably settled; or so valiant, as to
force a passage through those Countries of Scythia, which neither Persians,
Greeks, or Romans were able to withstand. But of this people more anon.

Tartaria is now usually divided into these parts, Precopensem. Asiaticam.
Antiquam. Zagathai. Cathai.


Adrianus.
TARTARIA PRECOPENSIS contains all Taurica Chersonesus, and the Asiatican
banks of Tanais. The chief cities are 1 Precops, whence the whole nation is
called Precopensis. 2 Crim, the ancient seat of the Tartarian rulers, whence
named they were the Crim Tartars. 3 Oczackow, the residence of the present
Princes. 4 Capha (anciently Theodosia) a town of great traffic, which
Mahomet the Great took from the Genois. The Tartarians were first placed in
this Country by Baido (or Roido) a brave Captain, which subdued all Muscovia.
Mahomet the great co^tracted with them a league; that the Tartar should aid the
Turk on all occasions with 60000 men, and those to demand no pay: to requite
which, the Tartar is to succeed in the Turkish Empire, if at any time the issue
male should happen to fail. After this covenant, the great Turk used (as
still he does) to send the new elected Cham a banner, as a token of his
approbation of their election.

The men of this Country, Boter.
as of the other 4 parts, are swarth, not so much by the heat of the sun, as
their own fluttishnesse; illfauored, thick-lipp'd, flat-nosed,
broad-shouldered, swift of foot, laborious, and vigilant; barbarous every where
in behavior, especially in Antiqua and Asiaticae. In religion they are some
Pagans, some Mahumetans. The women are suitable to the men, wanting and scorning
money; adorning themselves with gew-gawes of copper, feathers, and latton.

TARTARIA ASIATICA, called also Muscovitica, and Deserta (as anciently Sarmatia
Asiatica;) is situate about the banks of the river Volga. The people here for
the most part, live in Tents made of beasts skins, and account it a great
misery to stay longer in a place, then the pastures afford meat for their
Cattle. For this reason they sow no corn, making horseflesh their chief food,
either warmed a little at their saddle bow or schorched with the sun; and use
to drink sour Mares milk. They live together in troops, which they call
Hordes, and in their iournies and remoues too and fro, they observe the
Pole-starre. Of these Herdes the more inclinable to ciuility are they of
Astrachan and Casan; who live in houses, sow Corn, and build defencible
Towns: which good orders have been but of late used, viz: since they were
made subject to the Muscouite, by the valor of Basilius and his son John
Basiliades. Before they were subdued by the Muscouite, Maginus.
they were divided states, and had two several Kings or Rulers. Casaus last
King by name Chelealcezks, submitted himself to the Emperor of Russia, and
became his tributary: but again reuolting, he was vanquished in field, and
his people eternally made subject Ano 1553. The Horde of Astrachan is situate
Southeast of Casan, down toward the Caspian Sea, and was conquered by Basilius
Anno 1494. Next to these, the principal hords are Zavoll, and Noyhan. Zavoll
called the great Hords, or the Hord of the Zavolhenses, lies between the
river Volga, and Iaich: and is as it were the mother of the rest. It had
particular kings till the year 1506, when the Cham of the Precopenses subdued
them: but they discontentedly bearing the yoke, gave unto Basilius a fair
opportunity, to bring them under the empire of Muscouy: which accordingly he
did. Noyhan called the Horde of the Noyacenses, is the most Northern Horde of
all, and has the most warlike people. They were first governed without any
King after the manner of Venice: but at last the Country was divided between
three of the most potent among them. Now they are again united under one
Prince or Duke, who is tributary to the Muscouite.

The chief Cities are 1 Casan. 2 Noyhan. 3 Scarayckzicke. 4 Astrachan, nigh
unto which Selimus the second, received a memorable overthrow by Basiliades.
Between this Country Precopense, and Muscouia, live the Mordwits: a Tartarian
people, which participate of all religions; being baptized like the Christians,
circumcised as the Jews, and Turks, and worshipping Idols like Pagans.

Purchase.
TARTARIA ANTIQVA, is the old habitation of the Tartars; from whence they
dispersed themselves like a violent whirle-winde over Europe and Asia. The
people are just of the same life and conditions with them of Asiatica. This
Country lies farthest North, as extending beyond the Polare circle, and
butting on the frozen Ocean; and though the vulgar lie either in skin Tents,
or under their Carts, yet have they some ^ewe Cities; as 1 Coras, famous for
the sepulcher of the Tartarian Chams. 2 Caracora, where Cingis was first
saluted Emperor. 3 Chinchitalas. 4 Campion: these Cities belong to the
Kingdom of Tenduc. The people hereof account it a great honor, to have their
wives and sisters, at the pleasure of such as they entertain: and when upon
the command of Mango Chan, they had for three years abstained from this
beastly practice; they obtained a restitution of it again, upon a
protestation, that they could never thrive since they left it.

Here is in this Country a beast of exquisite shape, about the bigness of a
Goat; which every full Moon has a swelling under the belly: which, the
hunters (at that time chasing the said beast) having cut it off, and dried it
against the Sun; proves a most dainty pleasing perfume. In this Country is
the Wilderness or Desert called Lop: From whence came King Tabor, whom Charles
the fifth burned at Mantua 1540; for persuading the people to return to
Iudaisme: and in this Country grows Rhubarbe, an herb of that excellent
nature, that the whole world is beholding to these Barbarians for it, as a
sovereign help for many diseases.

ZAGATHAI, called of old Scythia intra montem Imaum, is situate about the
Caspian Sea; extending to the borders of the Sophian Empire. It comprehends
the Provinces of Bactria, Sogdiana, Margiana, Turchestan, and Zagataia.

Margiana lies South to Tartaria Antiqua, and East to Hircania: the chief
Cities are 1 Indion, called once Alexandria Margianae; a Town which Antiochus
Soter king of Syria fortified with a strong wall. 2 Maran, nigh unto which
Ismael Sophie overthrew the Cham of Tartarie.

Sogdiana, lies on the North of Bactria: The chief Cities are Oxiana, seated
on the river Oxus. 2 Maruca. 3 Alexandria Sogdianae built by Alexander at his
going toward India. Here also stood in the time of Alexander, the strong and
famous City of Cyropolis, built by Cyrus, to fortify his borders against the
Scythians. It held out against that great Macedonian, a long time; and he
himself coming nigher to the walls, then discretion would permit an
ordinarily General; had such a blow on the neck with a stone, that he fell to
the ground, his eyes swimming in his head, and his whole army giving him for
slain. But reviving, he took the town by a mine, and leuel'd it with the
ground.

Bactria lies East to Margiana, and South to Sogdiana; this Country is now
called Chorazzau, the two former Iess^^bas from their green turbats. These
Bactrians are by Curtius said to have been a people very cruel, always in
arms, resembling much the Scythians, whose neighbors they were; and (which
was their greatest virtue) multum a Persarum luxu abhorrentes, nothing so
effeminate as their Lords the Persians. Over these Bessus was Captain, who so
villanously betrayed Darius; and was by Spitamenes served with the same sauce;
who delivered him into the power of Alexander, and he into the ^ands of the
hangman. The chief Cities are 1 Istigias, one of the most pleasant Cities of
the East. 2 Chorazzan, whence comes the name of the whole region. 3 Bud^san
formerly Bactra. In the time of the Assyrian Monarch Ninus, here reigned the
first king Zoroastes, who is said by some, first to have invented Astronomy:
which assertion I dare not affirm, considering that the fathers before the
flood were well seen in this science. Perhaps the invention hereof is
attributed to the king, either for that he first committed that to writing,
which was taught by tradition: or else compiled the confused writings of
others, into one methodicall body. Against him Ninus made war, but was forced
to fly with the loss of 10000 Assyrians; and having again repaired his army,
encountered Zoroastes, slew him, and united Bactria to his Monarchy. Afterward
it was made subject to the Persians, then to the Syrian successors of
Alexander, til the year of the world, 3720: in which time Theodates, one who
was but governor of 1000 Cities and Towns (by which we may guess at the
former populousness) assumed to himself the title of King: which honor
continued in his family, til the year 3786; when Enchrendes the last king, was
slain by the Bogdians, and Drangians. Then returned it to the Syrians;
afterward it was sub^ected to the Romans, under whom it received the Christian
faith by the preaching of St Thomas, together with the other two Provinces. The
Persians, Sarracens, and now the Tartars have been successively their Lords.

Turchestan, is the Country where the Turks first inhabited, before their
irruption into Armenia. The chief Cities are Calba, and Ocerra. That this
people took the name of Turks, either from the Teucri, the Trojans, or from
Turca a town of Persia, is frivolous to affirm; considering how long before
the Turks had any commerce with the Persians, Pomponius Mela places the Turcae
and Thyrsagetae together in this tract: and as for their descent from the
Trojans, I hold it so vain, that it needs no confutation. The first time
that ever this people took on the^ any military emploiment, was in the reign
of the Emperor Mauritius, about the year 600: when they were discomfited by
Chaganus, Captain or Cham of the Avares, another Scythian nation, of whom we
have before spoken in Hungarye. Their second expedition as it was more
necessary, hunger enforcing them to it; so was it also more prosperous: stating
them in a great part of the greater Armenia, Anno 1844; and what they have
since done, we have there told you.

Zagataie, the name giver at this day to all the Province; took its name from
Sachetaie a Noble man of the Tartars: to whose care this part of their new
Empire was committed. To him succeeded Ogg, who was the father of Tamerlane;
who by marriage with the daughter and heir of Gino Chan, obtained the
Tartarian Empire. He subdued the Egyptians, Syrians, Persians, and Turks;
against whose unfortunate King Bajazet the first, he conducted an Army of
700000 fighting men, and won a famous victory of his enemy: he terrefied the
Muscovites, and frighted the puissant King of China: and dying divided his
Empire amongst his sons; who lost it in as short space as their father had
conquered it: nothing remaining not subdued, of which Tamerlane was not
possessed, before his warre-like expeditions.

The chief Cities are 1 Bochara, the seat of the Provincial Governor. 2
Sarmachand, which gave both a Cradle and a Grave to mighty Tamerlane. This
City he enriched, with all the treasury and spoils of his manifold
victories; and in one instance to speak the rest, he sent hither from Damascus
only, 8000 Camels laden with spoils, and choicest moveable goods. From this
Tamerlane the great Moguls are descended. This Town was originally called
Matacanda, and was by Spitamenes (who having delivered Bessus into the hands of
Alexander, afterward revolted from him) made good against the Macedonians:
Menedemus with 3800 men besieging it. But Spitamenes prevailed, slew Menedemus,
and 2300 of his Soldiers; and then fled to Bactria: where he was slain by his
wi^e, and his head presented to the Conqueror. At this Town also was it that
Alexander in a drunken fury, slew his friend Clytus; who at the battle by the
river Granvicus, had saved his life, by receiving a blow directed at him.

CATHAIE is bounded on the East with the Oriental Ocean, on the West with the
other Tartarian Provinces, on the North with the Scythicke Sea, and on the
South with China. This is thought to have been the ancient habitation of the
Seres; who being excellent in the weauing of silks, which they made of a fine
wool growing on the leaves of trees, occasioned all silks to be called
Serica. It is said of this people, that they had neither thief, nor whore
among them.

The soil abounds with variety of fruits; superfluously furnished with Rice,
Grain, Wool, Silk, Hemp, Rhewbarbe, Musk, and excellent fine Chamlets. So
that it scorneth to give precedence to any of the flourishing Provinces in
Europe.

The people are very warlike, strong in matters of action, fearelesse of the
greatest dangers, and patient of labor and want. They are of mean stature,
little eyes, sharp sight, and wear their beards thin. They are of a very
good wit, dress them selves gorgeously, and fare on occasions sumptuously.
Finally these and they of Zagataie are the most honorable people of the
Tartars, indifferently civil, lovers of arts both mechanical and civil, and
inhabiting diverse fair Cities. The chief are 1 Caraian where the women use
to gild their teeth. 2 Tebeth, famous for her abundance in Coral. 3 Cambalu,
seated on the river Polysanga, honored with the great Chams residence, and
enriched with a mighty confluence of Merchants of all sorts: besides other
merchandises, there are every year 1000 Carts loaded with silk, sent thither
from China. This City is in compass 28 miles besides the Suburbs; in which
besides other inhabitants of all sorts, are 50000 Astrologers, or rather
fortune tellers. 4 Xaindu, the Palace of the Emperor, is of a fouresquare
figure, every side extending 8 miles in length: within this quadrate is
another, whose sides are 6 miles long, and within that another of four miles
square, which is the Palace it self. Between these several walls, are
Walks, Gardens, Orchards, Fish Ponds, places for all manner of exercise, and
Parkes, Forests, Chases for all manner of game.

Cathaie was anciently called Scythia extra montem Imaum, and took, no doubt,
this name from the Cathei, whom the textuarie Geographer Strabo, places in
this tract. The people hereof were converted by S. Andrew, and long continued
Christians though infected with the opinions of Nestorius, whose sect at this
day is spread all over the East. They differ from the Church of Rome and
Greece, saying that in Christ were two persons, as well as two natures. 2, that
the Virgin Mary ought not to be called (...). 2 Their Priests may marry when
and as often as they will. The chief means by which this heresy is so
propagated, was by the wickedness of Cosrees, a king of Persia; who upon a
mere hatred to Heraclius the Greek Emperor, enforced all the Christians
inhabiting his dominions, to become Nestorians, or abandon their country. Their
Patriarch has his residence at Musal in Mesopotamia; which dignity is not
elective, but descends from the Father to the son. The solemnities of
marriage because they are somewhat usual, I will now relate unto you. Their
wives they see not till they are married, but hearing a good report of the
young woman, solicit her father for her. If he yield, then they meet at the
Chancell of the Church, in which there is a partition: the man and his friends
standing on the one side; the womar and her friends on the other. When they are
met, the Cassise, or Churchman, bids the young man put his hand through a
hole in the partition, and take his wife by the hand; which he does. Then
comes the mother of the young woman, and with a sharp pointed instrument all
to be pricketh the new married man's hand. If when he feels the smart, he
lets his wives hand go; they take it for a sign that he will not love her:
but if he hold her fast, and wring her by the hand till she cry; then is he
counted a loving man, and her friends are glad that they bestowed her on him.
After the marriage consummate, if a male child be borne unto them, the father
loses his own name, and is called by that of his eldest son; and if the
fathers name be Moses, and the sons name Joseph; the father is no more
called Moses, but Aben Joseph, that is the father of Joseph: so highly do they
reverence marriage, and the fruit thereof posterity.

The people of this Country inioyed all the immunities of good subjects under
the Nestorian kings of Tenduch; to whom the name of Prester John more ^ightly
belongs, then to the Emperor of Habassia, or Aethiopia interior. The last of
these Kings of Tenduch was Vn-cham, who using indirect dealings toward the
Tartars, a base and obscure people; provoked the^ now ready to leave his
neighborhood, and seek new habitations, to turn their whole forces against
him: whom they easily vanquished, and made Cingis their Captain king of
T^nduch.

It is recorded that Cingis before he joined battle with Vn-Cham, consulted
with his diuiners and Astrologers of the success. They taking a greenereed
cleft it asunder, writ on the one the name of Cingis, and Vn-Cham on the other:
and placed the^ not far asunder. Then fell they to reading their Charms and
coniurations, the two reeds fell a ^ighting in the sight of the whole army, and
Cingis Reed overcame the other: whereby they foretold the joyful news of
victory to the Tartars, which accordingly happened. And this was the first step
by which this base and beggarly nation began to mount unto the chair of
Empire and Sovereignty: whereas before they lived like beasts having neither
letters nor faith, nor dwelling, nor reputation, nor valor, nor indeed any
thing fitting a man.

The great Chams of Tartary
1162 1 Cingis, Cinchius, Zingis, or Changius, was made king or Cham of the
Tartars: he subdued Tenduch and Cathaia; Changing the name of Scythians and
Scythia, to Tartarians and Tartaria, 6. 1168 2 I^cuchan Cham, or Hoccata
succeeded. In his time the name of Tartar was first known in Europe; Ao. 1212
in which year they drove the Polesockie from the banks of the Euxine Sea. By
his Captain Bathu or R^ido he subdued Muscovia, planted his Tartars in Taurica
Chersonesus* wasted Hungary, Bosnia, Seruia, Bulgaria; and by his other
Captains took Persia from the Turks. 3 Zaincham, Bathu, or Barcham, ruined
the Tarkes kingdom of Damascus, and Asia the less. 4 Gino Cham, whose
daughter conveyed the Empire unto her husband Tamirlane or Tamberlan. 5 Tamir
Cutlu, Tamir Cham, or Tamirlane, a great tyrant, but withal an excellent
Soldier: that it is thought that he subdued more Provinces in his life time,
then all the Romans had done in 800 years, at what time their Monarchy was at
the height. 6 Allan. 7 Mango, to whom Haiton an Armenian Prince, and chief
compiler of the Tartarian history, went for aid against the Caliph of Babylon.
8 Cobilai. 9 Tamor. Thus far Paulus Venetus, and Haiton Armenius have spoken
of the Tartarian proceedings: what Kings have since reigned we cannot learn;
nor what memorable acts have been done among them. The great distance of
Countries and difficulty of the journey have hindered further discoueries: For
the great Cham, the Duke of Muscovie, and the king of China, will neither
suffer any of their subjects to travel abroad; nor permit any forrainers to
view their dominions, or enter into them, unless either Ambassadors or
Merchants.
This government is tyrannical; the great Cham is Lord of all; and in his
tongue, besides which they have almost no laws consists the power of life or
death: he is called by the simple vulgar, the shadow of spirits, and son of
the immortal God. At the death of the Cham, the 7 chief Princes assemble to
crown his son; whom they place on a black course cloth, telling him if he
reign well, heaven shall be his reward: if ill, he shall not have so much as
a corner of that black cloth to rest his body on: then they put the Crown on
his head, and kissing his feet, swear unto him fealty and homage. And at the
funeral of these great Monarchs they use to kill some of his guard soldiers,
whereof he has 12000 in continual pay: saying unto them: Ite and domino
nostro seruite in alia vita. Paulus Venetus reports, that at the obsequies of
Mango Cham, no sewer then 10000 were slain on this occasion.

These Chams are for the most part severe iusticers, and punish almost for
every small fault with sudden death; but theft especially: insomuch that a man
in Cambalu taking a paile of milk from a woman's head, and beginning to drink
thereof; was upon the woman's outery apprehended, and presently cut in sunder
with a sword; so that the blood and the milk came out together. The next
capital crimes to these are lying and adultery; which among the very first
laws of Cingis, were enacted to be punishable also by death.

This Country is under the same clime with Muscovia. The chief river of the
Precopenses, is Tanais: of Asiatica, Volga, and Petzora: of Antiqua, Tartar,
whence the nation took their name: of Cathay, Curata. 2 Poiysanga. 3 Zaiton. 4
Mecon, as also the Lakes of Guyan, 2 Dangu. 3 Dandu. 4 Catocara: and lastly of
Zagataie, 1 Iaxartes. and 2 Oxus. This last is a fatal bound of Monarchies:
the Persians never passed it to extend their dominions, but received some
notable overthrow, as that of Cyrus against the Scythians: and the Tartars
fare in the same manner attempting the like matter, as when Saba the Cham of
Zagataie, was overthrown by Ismael Sophie of Persia. These two last arise from
the branches of Mount Taurus, and exonerate their full stomachs into the
Caspian or Hircanian Sea.

Thus much of Tartaria.

OF INDIA.
INDIA is bounded on the East with China, on the West with the river Indus,
from whence it takes denomination; on the North with Tartarie, on the South
with the Ocean.

This Country extends in length from China to Persia, 3600 miles; and
stretches from Taurus to the Ocean: this being the biggest country,
comprehended under one name, of any in the world, excepting Tartaria and China.
It is situate between the first and sixth Climats, the longest day being in the
South parts of 12 hours only; but in the North fifteen hours and a half.

Concerning the monst^ous fables which foregoing times have delivered unto us,
give me leave to say; that as the Poets of old, used to fill up the times of
which they were ignorant, with strange fictions, and prodigious metamorphoses;
or as our modern Geographers in their Maps of the world, fill up those
unknown parts thereof, of which they can give us no certain description, with
strange pictures, and uncouth shapes of beasts and trees: so also the writers
in former ages, have filled the more remote Countries of which they know
little, with such impossible and incredible relations. Hence there have been
attributed to this India, the tales of men with dogs heads; of men with one
leg only, yet of great swiftness; of such as live by sent; of men that had
but one eye, and that in their foreheads; and of others whose ears did reach
unto the ground. It is reported also, that this people by eating a Dragons
heart and liver, attain to the understanding of the languages of beasts; that
they can make themselves, when they list, invisible; that they have two tubbes,
whereof the one opened yields wind, the other rain, and the like. But of
these relations and the rest of this strain, I doubt not but the understanding
Reader knows how to judge, and what to believe; for my part I am of the same
mind with Curtius, Plura equidem transcribe quam credo; nec enim affirmare
ausus sum quae dubito, nec subducere sustineo quae accepi.

The old inhabitants of this Country were the Daedalae, Mazaga, Abisarae,
Sop^ites, Gangarides, Phartasii, Sobij, Malli, Sabracae, Musicani, Oxydracae,
etc. all conquered by Alexander in his expedition into this Country. The Malli
and Oxydracae are most famous, for a story attributed unto the^, which is this.
Alexander besieging the chief City of the Oxydracae, says Curtius (of the
Malli, says Plutarch) was the first that scaled the walls, and the last that
could do so; the ladder breaking as soon as he was at the top. Standing thus
alone as a mark to all their darts, he was by his Soldiers desired to leap
down among them; but he in a daring brauado leaped into the town among his
enemies: where it was not only his good hap to light upon his feet, but to have
an old tree at his back to defend him behind. In this posture he is said to
have maintained the fight a long time against all the townsmen; killing two of
them with his own hands, and by that example teaching the rest to be more
mannerly: till being wearied and dangerously wounded, he was forced to leave
his feet, and commit the weight of his body to his knees. In this case Leonatus
Peucestes, and some other of his Captains came to assist him, who defended
their dying master, till the whole Army entered the Town, and put all the
people to the sword; in revenge of their King, whose life they had little hope
to enjoy, though he with much danger did afterward recover. For my part, I give
little or no credence to this story, ranging it in the same catalogue of truth
with the adventures of Donzel del Phoebo, Rosicleer, Beliauis, Amadis, and the
rest of the rabble of Knights errant: neither is this the first time that
Curtius has disgraced the soundness of Alexanders judgment, and the truth of
his actions, with the like idle and impossible tales, though indeed in this
particular he says that it was multo magis ad temeritatis quam ad gloriae
famam.

The principal rivers of this Country are, 1 Indus the boundary of the Persian
and Indian Empires; which having his head in the mountain Caucasus, now called
Naugrariot; openet^ himself with two mouths into the Indian Ocean; having
first run a course of 900 miles. 2 Ganges, of which more anon. 3 Hydaspes, on
whose banks Alexander built Bucephalia in honor of his horse Bucephalus there
dying. On the banks of this river stood the City of Nysa also, the chief
City of India in the time of Alexander. 4 Acesines. 5 Hirotis. and 6 Zaradus;
all three emptying themselves into the Indus.

This Country, even in ancient times has been noted for abundance of all
things, either necessary for the maintenance of life, or pleasant to the relish
of the palate: as also for abundance of Camels, Apes, Dragons, Serpents,
Rhinocerots, and Elephants. These Elephants do seem to have a smack of
reason, and certainly partake more of humane ingenuitie, then any other brute
creature whatsoever. The Elephant which King Porus rode on, seeing his master
strong and lusty, rushed into the thickest of Alexanders Army; but when he
perceived Porus to grow faint, he withdrew himself, and kneeling down received
all the arrows shot against his master in his own trunk.

Bacchus was the first that entered and conquered this Country, as indeed what
regions first or last has not he brought under his winie Empire. Hence one
thus descanteth, First Bacchus did this Country overrun,
And set up trophies in the conquered East:
Oh would he had gone on as he begun,
And never turned to subdue the West.
Might Indus banks have borne his branching vines,
Nor Europes streams bin stained with sweeter wines.
After Bacchus, Semiramis Q. of Assyria was the first that ever entered India in
hostile manner; part whereof she made tributary, and slew Staurobates the king
thereof. Next unto her, Alexander the great invaded it, at which time there
were many kings and free Cities* whom the Gymnosophists persuaded to defend
their liberty. These Gymnosophists were to the Indians as the Druides to the
Britains, and are called by the Indians, Brachmanni. These are had in great
reverence: and live for the most part, a very austere and solitary life, in
caves and deserts, seeding on herbs, and wearing poor thin weeds: and for
a certain time abstain from all kind of vice: But that time once past, they
may (as it were) by privilege, defloure virgins, and commit what riots they
list. Others of them live together with the people, as being their ordinary
Priests. Of these Alexander surprised 10, one of which was Calanus, to whom he
propounded strange questions, and received strange answers. He first dealt
with Taxiles a prudent Prince, whose kingdom was bigger then Egypt; who both
overcame and was overcome by Alexander in courtesy. Next with King Porus in a
more hostile manner; for he discomfited his Army, and took Porus prisoner, who
was four cubits and a shafes length high. Afterward he sailed down the
Ganges, unto the maine Ocean; and was the first and last (till of late) that
ever durst adventure such a navigation. After this expedition of Alexand^r, the
Indians inioyed many years of peace. The successors of Alexander were for the
most part on the loosing hand: the power of the Romans they rather knew by
report, then trial: yet was it not amiss to enterta^ne a potent, though
remote state, in terms of amity. Therefore they sent Ambassadors unto
Augustus, who presented him with a number of Tigers, Di^^.
(which beasts till then, the Roman people had never seen;) and which was most
pleasing, a little boy borne without arms, who with his feet could bend a bow,
shoot, and play on a wind instrument as exactly, as others with their hands.
Traian the Emperor had a great desire to see this Country; but after these
times by little and little, histories have bin in a manner silent concerning it.
For notwithstanding that there was continual traffic from the Red sea
hither: and between the Persian, Turkish, and Indian merchants for spices, and
the other commodities of this Region: yet were not these merchants acquainted
with the state of the country; because they entered not into it, but were met by
the Indian merchants at Sarmachand, being (as it were) the common Emporie.
Neither did the Egyptians at all enter into India, but were met by the Indians
at Ormus, or some other Island: (even as now the Chinoys make some of the
Philippinae, the staple of their trade with the Spaniards; whom they license
not to come into the Continent among them:) but our modern navigations have
with-drawne the Mask of obscurity, and show us her lively portraiture in as
lively colors. It enjoys two summers, an exact temperature of the air, and
double increase. Abound it does in all manner of Mineralls, except Copper and
Lead: stored with all sorts of Cattle, except horses: more particularly with
Mines of gold, precious stones, spices of all sorts, and Ciuet: Wheat only and
Vines are wanting, that so this Country might be beholding to others, as
others to this.

The people are indifferently civil and ingenious, both men and women imitate
a majesty in their train and apparel, Purchase.
which they sweeten with oils and perfumes, adorning them with Jewels,
Pearls, and other ornaments befitting.

They are now a natioo composed of 5 several people, 1 the Indians or natives,
which are in part Gentiles, in part Christians. Those which are Gentiles
retain among them many of their old customs, as not knowing their wives after
they have borne them two children; not accompanying them if after five years
cohabitation they can raise no issue by them, but exchanging them for others;
as never being rewarded for any military exploit, unless they bring with them
an enemies head in their hand; killing their friends before sickness withers
them, etc. As for the Christians (to which Religion they were converted by S.
Thomas) they still retain the name and profession, which they have now
reformed (I should have said deformed) according to the Church of Rome; which
was effected in a Synod held for that purpose at Goa, Anno 1599, at what time
they delivered up all their books to the censure of the Roman-Spanish
Archbishop of Goa, to be by him corrected; and permitted their Liturgy also to
be by him altered. Before this union, they used 1 to administer the Sacrament
with bread seasoned with salt; 2ly instead of wine (because India affords
none) to use the juice of rasins, softened in water one night, and so pressed
forth: 3ly not to baptize their children til 40 days old, unless in danger of
death: 4ly to permit no images in their Churches but of the Cross only: 5ly
to debar their Priests from second marriages: and 6ly to paint GOD with 3
heads on one body, denotating thereby the Trinity. The second sort of people
which inhabit this Country, are Mahumetan Persians and Tartars, especially
since the Moguls great victories here. 3 Jews, who live straglingly dispersed
in all quarters. 4 Arabians, or Moors, who 200 and odd years past, seized on
some hauen-townes, driving the Natives up higher into the inland Country. And
5 the Portugals, who possessing some few Sea-townes, commodious for traffic,
brag of the conquest of the whole Country, which they are in no more
possibility to conquer, then the French was to subdue Spain, when he was
possessed of the fort of Perpignan, pawned to him by John King of Arragon and
Navarre.

The river Ganges arises in the Scythian hills, Purchase.
and carrying with it an incredible breadth and depth, disburdeneth it self
into the South Ocean. The breadth of it is in the narrowest place 8, in the
broadest 20 miles; the depth of it is never less then 100 foot. That this
river is not that which is called in the Scriptures Pison, which compasses the
land of Havilah, where there is gold; we have already proved in Mesopotamia:
our reason being drawn from the ouer-large extent which must then be
necessarily given to Paradise; in which the river Pison is said to have risen.
And though indeed India is thought, and that truly, to be the land of Hauilah;
yet why should Ganges that divides India, be thought to be Pison, rather then
Indus which boundeth it; and which also lies far nearer to Tigris and
Euphrates, then this Ganges? But to make it more plain: certain it is that
there were two lands of Hauilah; the one so named from Hauilah, the son of
Iocktan, (who with his brothers Ophir and Iobab, dwelt toward the East, Genesis
10. ver. 29.30,) which is this India, or a part of it: and the other so named
from Hauilah, the son of Chush, (of whom mention is made in the 7 verse of
the same Chapter,) which is the land of Susiana, a butting North on
Mesopotamia. This Ganges yet, though it be none of the rivers of Paradise, is
as famous as those which are. For down this river did Alexander with such
danger sail to see the Ocean: To this river the superstitious Indians go
devoutly on pilgrimage; strongly believing that they are secure of salvation,
if at the time of their death they may drink of this water. This riuer-flowing
the Country, enricheth it, as Nilus does Egypt: and finally it divides the
whole Country into two parts, viz: India intra Gangem, and India extra Gangem.

INDIA INTRA GANGEM.
INDIA INTRA GANGEM, called also INDVSTAN, is divided into 47 Provinces or
Kingdoms: whereof two have yet their proprietary kings, namely Narfinga and
Calecute: the rest are under the command of the great Mogor, Mogul, or Mongul.
The chief of the 47 Provinces are

1 NARSINGA, which has a king acknowledging no superior command. The people
hereof use to burn the wives together with their husbands; and she is thought
to have bin most loving during his life, which is now most willing to accompany
him in his death: and offer her self to his Manes at the funeral pile,
whereunto thus alludeth the Poet, Et certamen habent lethi, quae viua sequatur
Coniugium; pudor est non licuisse mori.
Ardent victrices and praebent pectora flammae,
Imponuntque suis ora perusta viris.
It Is not to die a shame, they therefore strive
Who may be famed to follow him alive:
The victor burns, yeeldes to the flame her breast,
And her burnt face does on her husband rest.
This kingdom is confined with the mountain Guate on the West; and the Gulf
of Bengala on the East, with the mount Guadaverno on the North, and the
Promontory Comari on the South: and is in compass 3000 miles. The chief
Cities are Maleaper or S. Thomas, where the body of the Apostle was burnt; but
Dorotheus says, that he rests at Calamina, where he was slain with a Dart.
2 Narsinga. 3 Bisnagar, burnt by 4 Sarac^nicall confederates, Anno 1567. 4
Candragni. The revenues of this Prince are no less the^ 12 millions of
Ducats: his forces for war are wonderful; he led an army consisting of
31690 horse, 60000 foot, and 558 Elephants, against Idalcan a neighbor Prince,
whom he discomfited. To this King also belongs the city of Tarnassarie, which
once had its peculiar kings, who were able to bring into the field 100
Elephants and 100000 horse and foot.

2 MALAVAR containe^h the Western part of that, which of old was called Aurea
Chersonesus, viz: from the mountain Guate on the East, to the Indian Ocean
West; from the Promontory Comari on the South, to the river Gangericor on the
North; the length whereof is 900 miles, the breadth nothing comparable. There
are 7 Provinces, viz: 1 Trauanear, 2 Colan, 3 Cochin, 4 Crangonar, 5 Tauo, 6
Cononor, 7 Calecute, all borrowing their names from their chief towns. These
were all under one king, till about 80 years ago, and somewhat more: at what
time Sema Pereimal the last king, being a Mahumetan; and intending to finish
his days in Mecha; divided his kingdom into 6 parts, giving them to six of
his kinsmen. Five of these at this day are under the great Mogul, the other
obeys the K. of Calecute, who is able to bring into the field 100000 fighting
men; of whose valor the Portugals have had often experiment, but always to
the loss of the Indians. The chief of these towns are Cononor, pleasantly
seated for traffic, as having a harbor no less safe, then capacious: it is
distant from Calecute 10 leagues. 2 Coccinum, or Cochin, distant from Calecute
30 leagues. The governor of this Town is the Pope or summus Pontifex of the
Brachmans: and 3 Calecute, which for 3 miles together lies along the Sea shore
It is a custom here for the King to give to some of the Brachmanni, the
hanselling of his nuptial bed. For which cause not the kings, but the kings
sisters sons, succeed in the kingdom; as being more certainly known to be
of the true royal blood: and these sisters of his, choose what Gentleman they
please, on whom to bestow their virginities; and if they prove not in a certain
time to be with child, they betake themselves to these Brachman stallions.
Calecute is a famous mart town, and the staple of all the India^ traffic.

3 BALASSIA, or the kingdom of Bocan, is famous for its inexhaustible Mines of
Gold and Silver; the chief Cities are 1 Balassia, 2 Bocan, whence the
duplicity of the kingdoms name: the first is seated on the river Gaibon; the
last was once the seat of her own Kings. 3 Senergian.

4 CAMBAIA called also Guzara, has on the East Mandao, on the West Gedr^sia;
Maginus.
on the North Dulcinda; on the South the Ocean. It is a Country very fruitful,
and exceedingly thick set with men and villages, of which last here is thought
to be no less then 600000. It was once the seat of the Rusbeti, who are the
ancient nobility of this Country: whom the Saracens under the leading of one
Machumat, subdued about 160 years since. To this Machumat succeeded his son
Mamudius, to him Badurius; who making an unjust war against the King of
Mandao, compelled him to call Miramudius a Mogul Tartarian of Zagatai to his
aid: who crushed by force of Badurius, and subdued the great Kingdom of
Cambaia to himself; and yet the army of the Cambaian consisted of 150000
horse, and 500000 foot, he had 1000 pieces of Ordinance, 500 Wagons laden with
Gunpowder and Bullets, 200 Elephants, and 500 chests full of Gold and Silver.
In this kingdom are 60000 Villages, Towns, and Cities. The chief whereof are
1 Ardauat once the kings seat. 2 Campanael, 3 Citor, a City of 12 miles
compass, Adrianus.
which the King of Cambaia took from the Queen of Crementina, Anno 1536. 4
Tanaa. 5 Cambaia a mighty City, and as populous, containing 800000 persons.

5 MANDAO is so called of Mando the chief City, which being 30 miles in
compass, held out a siege of 12 years against Miramudius, or Merhumed: after
which time it was surrendered. 2 Moltan, where the women ride booted and
spurted, a fashion lately imitated by some mimicke dames of England. 3 Scernus
on the river so called: and 4 Polymbothea. This Mandao was a kingdom of power
sufficient, till Badureus of Cambaia oppressed it; after whose defeat, Marhumid
the Mogul feazed also on this kingdom: showing that the easiest way for a
Prince to ruin his own estate, and endanger his neighbors, is to make a gap
open for a foreign power, to compose a homebred dissension.

6 BENGALA is famous for its multitude of Rhinocerots; a kingdom once free,
till Echebar the Mogul united it to his Empire. Tbe chief Cities are Catigan
and Satagan on the banks of Ganges (called also Chaberis and Guenga.) 3
Bengala, nigh unto Sinus Gangeticus, now called the Gulf of Bengala. Nigh unto
this town is the place called Gongasagie, that is the entry into the sea; in
which are many fishes called Sea-dogges; into which place they which are weary
of this world, and desire to have a quick passage into Paradise, cast
themselves to be devoured of these fishes: persuading themselves that the next
and readiest way thither, is through their jaws. 4 Ouros, the seat of the
Bengalan kings: and 5 Banneras, seated on the river Ganges.

7 ORISTAN or Orissa, is peopled for the most part with Christians of S.
Thomas; so called because he converted them. Many of the people have their
legs made after the manner of an Elephants leg, which punishment the rest
think to be inflicted upon them, because their Progenitors massacred the
blessed Apostle. The chief Cities are 1 Orissa, once the Kings seat. 2 Ramana,
3 Vlna, where (if I remember aright) the women in a foolish pride, black their
teeth, because dogs teeth (forsooth) are white.

8 CANORA, called also the kingdom of Decan, was the habitation of
Venozarares; whom Sanosaradine king of Delli either totally cast out, or
subjected to his command: and as his deputy substituted one Abdessan, to whom
in that regencie succeeded his son Mamudza In his time Sanosaradine dying,
left his son to inherit his estate; as able to rule so many different
nations, as Phaeton to rule the Chariot of the Sun. This defect Mamudza
perceiving, made himself absolute King of Canora; and dividing the whole into
18 parts, he appointed as many Lieftenants General to govern them. These 18
Captains combining together, stripped him of all his dominions; and then
falling at odds about the extent of their kingdoms, were quickly brought
under subjection by Adabar the Mogul.

The chief cities are 1 Vltabat. 2 Danagar, 3 Lispor, famous for her quarries
of Adamants. 4 Melind. 5 Barticala: and 6 Onor.

9 DELLIE, was the ancient seat of Belemi, whom the Saracens vanquished: from
which Victors descended Sanosaradine, who Anno 1300, subdued Canora: and from
whose successors the Moguls taking it, have ever since honored Dellie, the
chief City hereof, Adrianus.
with their residence. The other being 2 Chesmnr, famous for the study of
Magic. 3 Tremel. 4 Fatabar.

This mighty Empire now contracted almost into one body, and formerly divided
between 47 several Princes, has to be amazement both of Indians, and all
people whatsoever, been conquered in less then 90 years, by the great
Moguls: so called (I think) for that they descended from the Mogul Tartars;
for before the Tartars freed themselves from Vncham King of Tenduc, Purchase.
they were divided into Market, Metrit, Summongul, Iccomongul, and Mongul
Tartars; from which last the name of Mongul has most probability to be diriued.

The great Moguls, or Mogors.
1 Emanpaxda, who first showed the Tartars the pleasure of India. 2 Marhumed,
who Anno 1536, subdued Cambaia, Mandao, Balassia, and other petty kingdoms. 3
Adabar, the Conqueror of Malavar, Dellie, and Canora. 4 Mahomet Selabdin
Echebar, who united Bengala and most of the rest of the inferior kingdoms. 5
Marad now living.
The revenues of this Empire cannot but be wonderful, Boterus.
considering that the King of Narsinga's amount to such a value: yet he cannot
cofter up much treasure, considering the men of war which he keeps in
continual pay. Neither is his strength in field inferior either to the
greatness of his Empire, or the largeness of his intrado; he being able to
raise 300000 Horse.

The subjects reverence this Prince exceedingly, making it holyday when he
cutteth his hair, or shaueth his beard; and spreading the way by which he is
at any time to pass, with costly ornaments, and delicate perfumes. He is
always carried on men's shoulders in a pompous chair, adorned with purple,
gold, and precious stones of great value.

There is no Prince either in Europe, Asia, or Africa, to whom the great
Monguls show such great respect and love, as they have done, and now do, to
our late Queen, and present King: They also esteem our soldiers very much,
especially since two or three of the Queens ships, braued 18 of the Portugals,
in the sight of many of his subjects: an adventure which could not but rejoice
him; considering the enmity between him and them.

INDIA EXTRA GANGEM.
INDIA EXTRA GANGEM has on the East China, on the West the rest of India. This
part of India, Maginus makes to be the kingdom of China; but upon what
ground, or by what reason persuaded, I know not: Sure I am that Ptolomie
places the Sinae or Chinoys, East of India, and therefore cannot be part of
it. As for his division of India intra Gangem, into the lower, containing the
Countries already described; and the higher, comprehending the Countries here
vnder-named; I will not stand to examine it: well knowing this division to have
bin for no other cause invented, but that China might with more facility be
believed, to be this India extra Gangem.

This India has formerly bin divided betwixt 12 Potentates, of no small riches
and puissance: but now by the puissance and prosperous fortunes of the King of
Barma, it is wholly subject to their command: the most remarkable of these 12
Kingdoms, are these seven.

1 MACIN, famous for the wood called Aloes, by the Arabians called Calambuco, by
Latin Writers Lignum vitae. This Wood for its sweet savor, is valued at its
weight in pure silver: as being not only serviceable for the pompous funerals
of great Princes; but also for Bathes: and with the Indians is held an
vnparallell'd medicine, for many grievous and dangerous maladies. The chief
City is Macin. 2 ARRACHAN is environed round with mountains, and impenetrable
Woods; the Cities of most note are Arrachan, distant from the Sea 45 miles; and
2 Ava, famous for her abundance of Gemmes. 3 CAMBOIA takes its name from the
chief city Camboia, situate on a river, which arising in China, so augmenteth
his waters, that his own Channel being insufficient to receive them, he
renteth the Earth into 100 Islands; and at last he fills a Lake with his
streams of 60 miles long. This Town is of great traffic and commerce for
its plenty of Gold, Silver, and Aloes. 4 CAVCHINCHINA abounds with the like
commodities. The people hereof in some few places are said to be Anthropophagi.
The chief Cities are Cauchinchina, situate on the Sea, and much frequented by
a continual concourse of Merchants; for Porceline, or China dishes here made.
2 Cacum. 5 BARMA called by some Brama, was before the coming of the Portugals
into India, a kingdom of no estimation; being subject to the command of the
Kings of Pegu, whose Lieftenants only they were, till about 60 years since:
when one of the Barmian Princes, Governor of Tangu, seized on the kingdoms of
Meliotali, Calan, Micand^, and Aua. He assaulted Pegu, and won it: he
beleagured Odia with 1000000 Soldiers, and forced it: He entered the kingdom
of Siam, and totally subdued it, making all the rest of his neighbors his
homagers. 6 SIAM, or regnum Sornaum, was not long since the Queen and Lady of
this part of India: but now is subject to the King of Barma, Purchase.
who won it Anno 1565. The principal Cities are Malacca, in compass 20
miles; seated in an unwholesome air, yet a town of great resort for the
traffic of spices. It is now subject to the Portugals, who have here an
Archbishop and a College of Jesuits. 2 Siam, the people whereof are very
opiniatiue, that after 2000 years, the World shall be consumed with fire; and
that under the ashes shall remain two eggs, whence shall come forth one man,
and one woman, who shall repeople the World anew. It is situate on the bank of
the river Menan, which every year ouer-floweth the Country for the compass of
120 miles: by which flood, the King of Pegu besieging this Town, Anno 1567,
with an Army of 900000 men, was forced to raise his siege; leaving behind him
in the waters, all his soldiers, except 70000 only. This is a most pleasing
city, whose stateliness gives name to the whole kingdoms. Here are besides
the Natives, about 30000 householders of Arabians. 2 Odia on the river Cuipumo,

is blessed with a rich soil. and a harborous seashore, extending 300 miles
in length, in which the principal haven is Martabane. As for the city of Pegu,
it is the fairest and most elegant City of all India; strengthened with large
and defensive walls, and adorned with neat and proportionable houses. It
stands on a river so named, and is distant from the sea 25 miles. The other
towns of note are Tauay, and Losmin; a Town of great commerce. This Country
about the year 1560, acknowledged no king but her own; whom about that time
one of the Governors of Tangu deposed; possessed himself of the chief City
Pegu; and Anno 1567, having discomfited the king of Siam, united these diverse
members under one head: and dying, lest his new-raised Empire to his son, a
Prince of a vicious and tyrannical nature; and not more cruel to his
subjects, then they disobedient to him. Whereupon preparations are made on both
sides, the people to defend their liberty, the king to preserve his royalty.
During these civil discords, the titulary King of Siam, whose late overthrow
was not yet fully digested; came violently into the Country of Pegu: burning
Corn, Grass, and Fruits; kil^ing man, woman, and child; and having satisfied
his fury, returned to his home. This spoil of the fruits of the earth, was but
a prologue to an unsupportable famine; which consumed all the inhabitants of
this flourishing Kingdom: except such whom the Granaries of the City Pegu
preserved, Anno 1598. For here the fathers devoured their children: the
stronger preied upon the weaker; not only devouring their more fleshie parts,
but their entrails also: nay they broke up the skulls of such as they had
slain, and sucked out their brains. This calamity incited another tributary
Prince of Tangu, to make his best advantage out of his neighbors affliction;
he therefore assaulted and entered Pegu, where he found as much treasure as 600
Elephants, and as many horses, could conveniently car^y away. This hauock being
made, he villainously murdered the King, Queen, and their children, and
departed; leaving the gleaning of his spoil to the King of Arrachan; who, Anno
1600, was expelled by the King of Siam, who inioyed it not long: for the King
of Barma having with an Army of 100000 fighting men, and 40000 Elephants,
subdued the kingdoms of Macin and Arrachan: followed the current of his
victories; conquered Siam, drove the King thereof from Pegu, where he has
built a most magnificent palace; and is now the sole Monarch of the 12
kingdoms of this India.
A more particular relation of this king, and his new-setled estate, we cannot
yet understand: what his revenues are, what his government, what his forces.
M^rchants whose inquisitiveness into the state-matters of other Princes is
dangerous; cannot give us any satisfaction: Scholars and experienced statists
are not permitted to observe: and such of the natives as could give most light
to these obscurities, are not suffered to leave the smoke of their own
chimnies.

Thus much of India.

OF CHINA.
CHINA has on the East Mare del Zur; on the West I^dia; on the North a wall
extending 1000 miles in length between the Chinoys and the Tartarians, Purchase.
built by Tzaintzon the 117^h King; on the South the Ocean.

The people are in the composition of their body, short-nosed, and black-eyed;
they wear long garments, and have very thin beards, consisting of not above
20 hairs. And as it is said that the Negroes do paint the devil white, as
being a color contrary to their own: so these Chinoys when they make the
portraiture of a deformed man, they paint him in a short habit, a thick
beard, broad eyes, and a long nose. From the description of the body, to
proceed to that of the mind: it is said that the Chinoys are ingenuous and
politic, much delighting in proficiencie in manual arts: for the son is
bound to follow the fathe^s occupation; which law preventing the roauing about
of idle people, and exciting in every breast an emulation of every art;
Description of China.
makes the inhabitants excellent artificers. In giving alms they are
bountiful to the maimed and the lame, but reject the blind, as being
sufficiently able to get sustenance for themselves, by corporal labor, as
grinding of Corn, etc. They have long inioyed the benefit of Printing, before
it was known in Europe. They print not as we use, from the lef^ hand to the
right; nor as the Jews, from the right to the left: but from the top of the
leaf, downward to the bottom. Gunnes also have bin used among the^ time out
of mind: whence they are so well conceited of themselves, that they use to
say; they themselves have two eyes, the Europaeans one, and the rest of the
people, not one.

That gunnes were in use among them even when Bacchus made his expedition into
India (which was some three or four years before or after the departure of
Israel out of Egypt) Sir Walter Raleigh seems to affirm: because
Philostratus in the life of Apollonius Tyanaeus, tells us, how Bacchus was
beaten from a city of the Oxydracae by thunder and lightning; which he
interprets to be the Cannon. Certainly himself in another place of his most
excellent book, acknowledges this Philostratus to have written fabulously;
and therefore no fit foundation for a conceit so contrary to probability, and
the opinion of all times. Besides, whereas Dion tells us, that by the benefit
of Thunder and Lightning from Heaven, Severus discomfited Pesceninus Niger; and
by the same means was himself repulsed from the walls of Petra, in Arabia: we
may (if this interpretation hold good) as easily maintain, that Seuerus had
great Ordinance in his camp, and the Arabians in their town. As for Printing,
whether John Gertrudenberg learned it of the Chinoys; or whether good
Inventions like good wits do sometimes jumpe, I dare not determine: sure I am
that he first taught it in Europe; and as some say, in the year 1440. At
Harlem it is said to be first practiced, and at Mentz perfected. Now whereas it
is by some doubted, whether the Art of Printing be available to the
proficiencie and advancement of Learning, or no; I must not herein be both
judge and party: but must leave the decision hereof to such who are not all
interessed in the cause. Only this I dare boldly say, that this most exquisite
Invention is too much abused, and prostituted to the lust of every foolish and
idle paper-blurrer; the Treasury of Learning being never so ouer-charged with
the froath and scumme of foolish and unnecessary discourses. And herein (though
all nations have their share) the Germans are most blameworthy; whose
Treatises (though neither worth the Printers hand, nor the Readers eye) fly so
thick amongst us, every year twice: that we may justly think them as
ouer-wise in their own, so somewhat short of a true proportion of discretion,
in our conceits. And so I leave the Chinoys and their inventions.

The Air is very temperate, the soil pleasant and fertile, abounding with
Barley, Rice, Wool, Cotton, Olives, Vines, Flax, Silk, all kind of Metals,
Fruits, Cattle, Sugar, Honey, Rueba^be, Porceline dishes, Camphire, Ginger, all
kinds of Spices, Wood, Musk, and Salt; the custom of which Salt, in only one
Town, viz: Canto, yearly amounts to the value of 180000 Crowns.

The Country is for the most part very plain, insomuch that they have Coaches
and Carts driven ordinarily with sails; and the seas so calm, that the small
barks in which they sail, have only an high bough standing in the midst of
them, by the help whereof they sail swiftly along the coasts. These plains
are tilled and sowed with all manner of fruit, of more excellency and
perfection then those of the Western parts; Boterus.
as also are their pearls, and the Bezoar, better then those of America. It
yields an herb out of the which they press a delicate juice, which serves
them instead of wine; and also preserves their health, and freeth them from
those evils, which the immoderat use of wine does breed unto us. They have two,
and in some places three haruests in a year: few mountains, but plains of an
hundred leagues compass. They eat thrice in a day, but sparingly: their
drink they drink hot, and eat their meat with two sticks of Ivory, Ebony,
or the like; not touching their meat with their hands, and therefore no great
filers of linen: The use of silver forkes in eating with us, with our sprucer
gallants, so much used of late, was no doubt an imitation of this.

The rivers and waters of all sorts run gallantly through these plains, with
an unspeakable profit for navigation and tillage: neither do the waters in
abundance of fish, yield at all to the fertility of the soil in fruits. The
chief river is Polisango.

China is of wonderful bigness, well nigh equalizing all Europe; for it is said
to be 3000 leagues in compass, Description of China.
and 1800 leagues in length. As for the name of China it is used only by us of
Europe, the inhabitants calling themselves Tamans, and Tabencos; the Arabians,
Tzinin; Paulus Venetus* Mangi; and their neighbors, Sangley: China therefore
is to be derived from the Sinae, a people, whom Ptolomie the old Geographer,
knowing the name of them, rather then the power* places in those parts: which
seems the more probable, because the Latin Writers do yet call it Sinarum
regio. And concerning the posi^ion of it in respect of the Heavens, it reaches
from the Tropic of Cancer, to the 53 degree of latitude; and extends from
the 130th to the 160^h degree of longitude. It is divided into 15 Provinces, to
the least of which, our Europaean Countries cannot admit comparison: which
together with their Towns and Cities thus follow.

The Provinces, Towns, and Cities of China.

Whose Metropolis is Suntien, vulgarly called Quinsay, contains in circuit
100 miles, having in the midst of it a lake of 30 miles compass, in which are
2 goodly Islands, and in them 2 magnificent Palaces, adorned with all
necessaries either for majesty, or convenience: in which are celebrated the
public feasts and marriages of the better sort. This lake is nourished with
diverse rivers, the chief being Polysango, and Cacamacan, on which river 12000
bridges lift up their stately heads, under whose immense Arches, great ships
with sails spread abroad, and top and top-gallant, may and do usually pass.
This City partly by the fury of wars, partly by the violence of Earthquakes,
has now lost no small part of her ancient beauty and renown. The other cities
of China, are 1 Quinchar, 2 Vnguen, famous for the abundance of s^gar there
made. 3 Nanquin, seated 9 leagues from the sea, on a fair and navigable river,
wherein ride for the most part, no fewer then 10000 of the kings ships,
besides such as belong to private men. This Town is in compass 30 miles, being
girt with 3 fair brick walls, having large and stately gates: the streets are
in length two leagues, wide, and paued: the number of the houses is about
200000; so that it may equal 4 of the f^i^est Cities of Europe. 4 Paquin or
Pagnia where the King continually resideth; and that either because the air
hereof is more healthful and pleasant, then any of the other: or because it
lies near unto the Tartars, with whom the Chinoys are in perpetual war* so
that from hence the dangers which may by their invasions happen unto the
Country, may with more conuenience be either prevented, or remedied. Of the
Palace more anon, only this of Paquin now; which is, that whereas all the
other P^ouinces of this great Empire are governed by substitutes, this and that
of Tolenchia, only are governed immediately by the King in person. 5 Ceivan. 6
Cengivan. 7 Lochean, containing 70000 families. 8 Colius, famous for Porceline.
9 ^aiton, whose harbor is never without 500 ships. and 10 Suchean seated in
the Marshes like Venice: a rich and goodly City, and very famous for
traffic. All these Cities notwithstanding the greatness and magnificence of
their foundations, are defective in that point of elegancie which our stately
Churches and more sumptuous buildings, for the dispatch of public businesses
abound within these parts: their houses also are very low, and destitute of
porches, galleries, and windows, the principal ornaments in Architecture.
These Cities differ not one from the other in the fashion of their building,
but only in quantity; much like the Cities of Vtopia mentioned by Sr Thomas
Moore, Idem situs omnibus, eadem vbique, quatenus per locum licet, rerum
facies: so that I may say with the Poet, vnam si noueris, omnes nosti; Grimston.
know one, know all: and this is their manner of building. There are two
great broad streets crossing one another in the very midst; so straight that
a man standing in the middle may discern either end: and at the end four
gates stately built and strengthened with iron.

These 15 Provinces contain 70 kingdoms, 1593 walled towns, 4200 unwalled
Towns, 1154 Castles, 591 Cities; besides such an in^inite number of Villages,
that the whole Country seems but one City. Herein inhabit 70 millions of
people, out of which the King (whom they call the Lamp of the world, and son
to the shining sun) in his warlike expeditions chooses never less then
300000 foot, and 200000 horse; without which complete number he daigneth not
to march. From such a number of subjects, and superfluity of Merchandise; he
raises a reuenew of 120 millions of crowns yearly.

Boterus.
We have said that the number of inhabitants is no less then 70 millions, which
if it seem incredible, may be made probable enough: if we consider the
spaciousness of the Country; 2 the secret goodness of stars, and
temperature of the air. 3 the abundance of all things necessary to life. 4
That it is not lawful for the King to make any war but merely defensive,
and so they enjoy perpetual peace. 5 That it is not lawful for any Chinois to
go out of the Country. And 6, that here the sea is as well peopled as whole
Provinces elsewhere: for the ships do resemble a City, in them they buy,
sell, are borne, and dye. And on the river which watreth the walls of Nanquin
up to Paquin, Purchase.
which is no less then 300 leagues; the ships are so thick ranged, that it
seems to be a continual street.

The people hereof are Gentiles, and conceive thus of the creation; that there
was one Taine, who created Panzon, and Panzona, whose posterity remained 90000
years: but they for their wickedness being destroyed, Taine Created Lutitzam,
who had two horns; from the right came men, from the le^t women. When any of
them dies they cloth him in his best apparel all perfumed, set him in his
best chair; and there all his nerest kindred kneeling before him, take their
leave with tears. When he is coffined they place him in a room richly
furnished and set by him a table full of viands and good cheer, with candles
continually burning on it. Not much unlike to which ceremonies, we find, how
whilst the funeral was preparing for Francis the French Kiug; his Statua
apparelled in royal roabes, with the Crown, Scepter, etc, was laid on his
bed: whether dinner and supper was duly served in, with the like state and
solemnity, as when he was living. But to return again to my dead Chinois;
when he has layen, as is above said, 15 days; he is carried forth to his
funeral, the place whereof is in the fields: for to be buried within the
walls, were a thing of all others the most wretched: hither when they are in
the manner of a procession, come; they burn his body, and with it men, cattle,
and other provision, for his attendance and sustenance in the other world.

The first King of China was named Vitei, Hist. of China.
who reigned 100 years: from whom to the present king, Boneg, are numbered 262
Kings; which have swaied the regal Scepter of these parts in a continual
succession, the space of 4000 years and more, if we will credit the relations
we have from thence. And which adds to the miracle, they have always lived
unconquered, unless it were in the days of Farfar, the 242 king. He was told
by prophecy, that he should be deprived of his kingdom, by one which had 100
eyes: which ^ell out accordingly, when Chisanbaan (which name signifies 100
eyes) Lieftenant to Vzan a Tartarian Prince, subdued China: which when it had
been for the space of 93 years under 9 Tartar Governors; was freed by the
valor of one Gombu, chosen for this act by the people the 51 king of China.

The greatest Courtiers belonging to this Prince are Eunuchs, whom their
parents in their infancy geld to make them capeable of this preferment; and of
whom there are no fewer then 160000, continually attending. His Palace where
he is most resident is in Paquin, compassed with a triple wall (the
outwardmost of which would well environ a large town) within which space,
besides the many lodgings for the Eunuchs; are Groves, Hills, Fountains,
Rivers, and the like places of pleasure: yet is it not equal in workmanship to
the Palaces of the Princes of Europe.

The Empire of China did once extends its power over all the Oriental Islands,
Boterus.
and, as some affirm, over no small part of America, and almost all Scythia.
But as we find in ancient historians, that the Romans having by the fury of
two violent tempests, lost no fewer then 206 of their ships and galleys;
resolved to abandon (and for a long time did forbear) the Seas, which had used
them so unkindly: So the Chinois having received a great overthrow, and loss
of 800 ships, nigh unto Zeilan; they freed all the Islands from obedience unto
them, and contented themselves with the bounds which nature had bestowed on
them. And of their moderation herein, we have a late example. For when the
people of Corea, a small Province abutting on the confines of China, were
invaded by the Iaponites; they submitted themselves unto the King of China: who
having repulsed the enemy, and thereby cleared his own Country from danger;
presently redeliuers over unto the Coreans, their Town and liberty.

Thus much of China.

THE ORIENTAL ISLANDS.
THE Islands of Asia are either in the Mediterranean Sea, as Rhodes, and Cyprus;
or in the Oriental Ocean, as 1 Iapan. 2 Zeilan. 3 Moluccae. 4 Iaua mayor. 5
Summatra. 6 Borneo. 7 the Philippinae, etc.

Purchase.
1 IAPAN, situated over against Cantan in China on the East, and the straights
of Anian South: is in length 600 miles, in breadth in some places 90, in others
30 only. The soil and the people participate much of the nature of China, but
that the Iaponites are more superstitious, as washing their children as soon
as borne, in rivers; and putting off their shoes before they enter into the
dining chamber. Perhaps these may be the Ilanders, who in mere opposition to
the Chinois, put off their shoes in salutation, because they of China put off
their hats: To whom our factious Puritans are fitly compared; who oppose
themselves against the Papists in things decent and allowable, though this
opposition be accompanied wi^h many gross absurdities.

The chief Cities of this Island are 1 Ossacaia. 2 Bunguin. 3 Fianocanca.
Adrianus.
4 Meacum. which once contained in circuit 21 miles, though now not half so
big. 5 C^ia. 6 Bandum, which is said to be an University bigger then Paris.
Here are in this Island 66 kings, some of which are so rich that their houses
are covered with gold. The chiefest of these kingdoms is called the kingdom
of Tenze, which of it self comprehends five of these petit Realms, all
lying about Meacum; and does now Lord it over 50 of these 66 kingdoms: so that
the K. of Tenze writes himself the Sovereign Prince of Iapon. This
augmentation of the Tenzean kingdom, came wholly by the valor of Faxiba, the
father of Taicosama now living; who the better to assure himself of his new
conquests, transported the vanquished Kings from one Country to another: to the
end that being removed out of their commands, and placed among strange
subjects, they should remain weak, and without means to revolt against him:
a politic and merciful course. What the revenues of this King are, we
cannot certainly tell, only we may guess them to be very great, in that he
has two millions of gold, for the yearly rent of that Rice, which is gathered
out of the possessions which he has reserved for himself.

This Island was discovered by Antonio Mota, a Portugal, and his fellows, An.
1542. It is much frequented by the Jesuits, of whom 200 are said to live here;
Xavier one of Ignatius first companions leading the way.

2 ZEILAN or Sarrandill lies in the Gulf of Bengala. Purchase.
It is in length 250, and in breadth 140 miles. So fruitful that grass
grows, and trees bear fruit all the year long without intermission. The
chief Cities are Zeilan, and 2 Columbus. There are herein 6 Kings, all
tributary to the great Mongull. This Island in fashion resembles an egg, and
is by a narrow channel divided from the cape Comari. The people are active,
expert in iuggling, and excellent managers of a hobbyhorse, by which seats of
actiuitie they get money all over India.

3 The MOLVCCOES are five in number, abounding with all sorts of spices. The
principal of the five are Tidore, Gilolo, and Terenate; all of them 18 miles
in compass: under the king of Terenate 70 Islands submit their delicious
commodities. Ad unto these Moluccoe^ the Islands of Banda or Bantan, both for
the vicinity in situation, and qualities: as abounding more in N^^megs then any
of the Islands of India, and for that cause much frequented. The chief Town is
Nera. In all these Islands as well of Banda, as the Moluccoes, the faith of
Christ b^gu^neth now to take deep root; though according to the (...) of the
Roman Church. It is reported that in this Island there is a fruit, of which if a
woman that is with child eat, her child will presently move: Galuano.
that there is a river plentifully stored with fish whose water is yet so hot,
that it does immediately scald off the skin of any beast that is cast into it:
that some of the men have tails, and most of their swine have horns: that
they have oysters which they call Bras^, the shells whereof are of so large
compass, that they Christen children in them: that in the Sea there are stones
which grow and increase like fish, of which the best lime is made: that there
is a bird called Monicodiata, which having no feet, is in continual motion;
and that there is a hole in the back of the Cock, in which the hen does lay
her eggs, and hatch her young ones. I bind no man to believe these relations:
for my part I say with Horace, Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.
What ever thus thou tell me, I
Will always hate it as a ly.

4 IAVA is either the greater or the lesser. The Greater is in compass 3000
miles, and for its wonderful fertility, is called the Epitome of the world.
The inhabitants use to eat the bodies of their dead friends, accounting no
burial so honorable, nor obsequie so applausiue. This is also a custom among
many of the rest of the Indians, Herodotus.
and so has been ever since the beginning of the Persian Monarchy. Herodotus
reports how Darius Histaspis understanding this custom; and withal knowing
how the Graecians used to burn their dead bodies: sent to the Greeks, that it
was his pleasure they should eat the bodies of their dead: But they used all
means of persuasion and entreatie, not to be enforced to so brutish and
barbarous an observation. Then commanded he the Indians to conform themselves
to the fashion of the Graecians; but they also more abhorred to burn their
dead, then the Greeks did to eat them. So impossible is it for a custom
either to be suddenly lest off, or to seem indecent and inconvenient. The
ch^efe Cities are, 1 Paliban. 2 Megapeger. 3 Agacin. and 4 Ballambua. The
lesser Iava is 2000 miles in compass, and divided between 8 Kings: The people
are good Seamen and great Pirates. The chief Towns are 1 Basnia, and 2 Sam^ra
Lambri. The Equator goes in the midst between these two Islands.

5 BORNEO is equally divided by the Aequinoctiall into 2 parts; putting, as it
were, bound between the dominions of the king of Borneo, on the North side; and
of Laus, on the South side. The Idolatrous people reverence the Sun and
Moon, who^ they deem to be man and wife; and think that the stars are
their children. They salute the Sun at his rising with great reverence,
repeating certain verses. Their public affairs are handled in the night; at
which time the Counselors of state meet and ascend some tree, viewing the
heavens till the Moon rise, and then go into the Senate house.

6 SVMMATRA was by Aristotle in his book de Mundo, esteemed to be the biggest
Island of the world: but modern experience has found it otherwise; it being
only 700 miles long, and 200 broad. The Equator cutteth through it, so that
the Suns vicinity does make it abundant in Pepper, Ginger, Aloes, Cassia,
Silk, Gold, and Silver. Here are 29 kings, the chief being of Pedir and
Aceni; whose subjects are the most loving men to their enemies that are, for
otherwise they would never eat them. They use the skulls of their eaten enemies
instead of money, exchanging them for their necessaries; and he is accounted
the richest man that has most of these in his house. Here is a hill called
Balalvanus which continually burns: and here are reported to be two strange
fountains, whereof the one runs pure Balsamum, and the other the best Oil.
The chief Cities are Daren. 2 Pazzen. and 3 Androgeda.

7 The PHILIPPINAE are so called of Philip the second of Spain, in whose time
they were discovered by Legaspi a Spaniard, Ao 1564. They are in number 11000,
of which 30 are under the King of Spain; and have received Christianity, the
rest remaining in Idolatry. The Chinoys were heretofore Lords of these Islands,
till they did voluntarily abandon them, confining their Empire within the
continent. Upon this relinquishment the people fell into civil wars, every
man becoming a tyrant, and the stronger preying on the weaker: which divisions
and factions gave, no doubt, great helps to the Spaniards in their conquest of
them.

There is another great fry of Islands over against China, which the Mariners
affirm to be no less then 7448; and another skull of them about India, no
fewer in number then 127000, all which laid together would make a continent as
large as three four parts of Europe, and are still groaning under the burden
of heathenisme. These Islands stand so nigh the one unto the other, that they
seem not only to such as are a far to be all but one firm land: but
whosoever also passes between them, may with his hands touch the boughs of
the trees on the one side, and on the other. Of these and the other Indian
Islands, travelers relate many incredible fables; as that here be hogs that
have two teeth growing out of their snowts, and as many behind their ears, of
a spanne and a half long: a tree whose western part is rank poison, and the
Eastern part an excellent preservative against it. They tell us also of a
fruit, that whosoever eats shall for the space of 12 hours be out of his
wits; and of a stone, on which whosoever sits, shall suddenly have a rupture
in his body. We are told also that hereabouts are taken Tortoises of that
bigness, that ten men might sit and diue within one of the shells; and that
here is a tree which all the day time has not a flower on it, but within half
an hour after sunne-set, is full of them. All huge and monstrous lies.

It shall not be amiss before we leave these Eastern Countries, to take a
superficial survey of such Castles, Towns, and Islands, as are at this day in
the possession of the Spaniards; who by this means are a terror to the
neighboring Princes.

In the Persian Gulf they possess the I Will of Ormus, which though it be
barren, yet it stands conveniently for the trafficque of Persia, Arabia, and
India. The customs only of this little Island, afford the King, which is a
Mahumetan, 140000 Seraffs yearly. This kingdom is tributary to the
Portugalls, who first fortified themselves here, Ao 1506. Of this Island the
Arabians use to say, Si terrarum orbis, quaqua patet, annulus esset,
Illius Ormusium gemma decusque foret.
If all the world should be a ring, the stone
And gemme thereof were Ormus I Will alone.


They have in Cambaio, the Towns Tana, Basa, and Daman; where 800 Portugalls
scorned the whole fleet of the great Mogul: as also the Island Diu, which was
given them by Badurius the last king of Cambaia, for their aid against Marhamed
the Moger or Mogul.

3 In Decan or Canora, they have Chaul, which Misamalucco a potent Prince of
these parts besieged, but could not force it, Ao 1573. They have also Goa the
Spanish Viceroys residence, who has here his Council, Chanceries, and
officers. This town was beleagured by Idalcan another Prince, with 35000 horse,
6000 Elephants, and 250 pieces of Ordinance; but in vain.

4 In Malauar they have Chalen and Colan.

5 In Zeilan they have fortified Columbus, bragging of one of the fairest
havens in the world.

6 In Siam they are Lords of Malaca, and the adjoining Castle; in which when
they surprised it, they found 900 pieces of Ordinance.

7 In the Moluccoes they enjoy Terenate. Yet for all these fortresses, the
English and Hollanders will not be hindered from traffic with these Indians;
by which commerce what benefit accreweth to our State, I meddle not.

Thus much of the Oriental Islands.

OF CYPRVS.
THe Islands in the Mediterranean sea, are Cyprus and Rhodes.

CYPRVS situate in the Syrian Sea, Ortelius.
is in compass 550 miles; extending from East to West 200 miles, and is in
breadth but 65 miles. It is situate under the fourth climate, the longest day
being 14 hours and a half: and is 60 miles distant from the rockie shore of
Cilicia, and a hundred from the maine land of Syria.

The air is in summer time exceeding hot and sweltrie; Sands.
the soil is moistened with some few brooks, meriting rather the name of
torrents, then rivers; which being generated for the most part by rain water,
are not seldom exhausted by the heat of the Sun: insomuch that in the reign
of Constantine the Great, this Island was for 36 years together almost utterly
forsaken, no rain falling all that time. These inconveniences notwithstanding,
it is stored with such plenty of all things, that without the help of any
foreign nation, it is of it self able to bu^ld a tall ship from the keele to
the topsayle, and so to put it to Sea furnished with all things needful for a
voyage, or a Sea Fight. It also abounds in Wine, Oil, Corn, Sugar, Cotton,
Honey, Wool, Turpentine, and Alum, Verdegree^e, all sorts of metals, store of
Salt, Grograms, and other commodities; whereupon this Island was once called
Macaria (i. e. happy) 2ly Cerastis because it butted toward the East with one
horn. 3ly Amathusia: and 4ly Cyprus from the abundance of Cypress trees there
growing. This Island was consecrated to Venus, who is hence called Venus Cypria,
and Dea Cypri, Sic te diua potens Cypri, in Horace: and in Ovid, Festa dies
Veneris tota celeberrima Cypro
Venerat ipsa suis aderat Venus aurea festis.
Venus feasts hollowed through all Cyprus came,
And Venus fair was present at the same.
The people hereof are warlike, strong, and nimble; of great civility,
hospitality to their neighbors, and love to strangers of al nations, Dion.
Jews only excepted. For in the Empire of Traiant, the Jews inhabiting
Egypt, and the confining Countries, joined themselves together, and chose one
Artemio their Captain; under whose conduct they entered into, and laid desolate
this Island killing in it 240000 living souls; and not without much bloodshed
were presently vanquished and slain by Lucius the Emperors Lieftenant. Since
which time the Cypriots permit no Jew to enter the Country; but come he thither
voluntarily, or be he beaten in by force of tempest, they lay hands on him and
put him to execution.

This Country is famous for the birth of 1 Aesclepiades, the author of the
verses so named; Sands.
and 2 Xenophon, the historian. 3 Zeno. 4 Apollonius the Philosopher; and 5
Solon, one of the wise men of Greece. The other six being, Periander of
Corinth, 2 Bias of Priene: 3 Thales of Miletum. 4 Pittacus of Mitilene. 5
Cleobulus of Lindum. 6 Chilo of Sparta. Here also was borne the Christian
Martyr S. Barnabie.

The Island is divided into 11 Provinces, in which the chief rivers are Pedeus
and 2 Tenus. Maginus.
The chief Cities are 1 Paphos, built, as it is by most said, by Cineras (the
father of Myrrha, and father and grandfather to Adonis) who so called it in
memory of his father Paphus. It was of old famous for the Temple of Venus. 2
Famagusta on the South Sea, built by Teucer, and called Salamine: at the
besieging of which town the Turks spent 118000 great bullets. 3 Nicosiae,
almost in the midst of the Country. This Town was anciently called Fremitus,
and Leucetum. 4 Amathus where Venus also was worshipped, and from whence the
whole Island was called Amathusia. 5 Ceraunia, now called Cerines, built by
Cyrus when he had vanquished the 9 Kings of this Island. 6 Arsinoe now called
Lescare renowned for the groves of Jupiter.

Cyprus was first made a kingdom by Teucer, who after the Trojan war came
hither: afterward it was divided between nine petty Princes, all of which
were subdued by Cyrus the first Monarch of the Medes and Persians. His Empire
being subverted by Alexander, this Island was given to the Ptolomies of Egypt:
from whom M. Cato conquered it to the benefit of the Roman Empire. The treasure
which Cato found here in ready money and moueables, amounted unto 7000 Talents:
which he fearing to loose by Sea, divided the sum into many small portions,
which he put into several boxes, viz: in every box 2 Talents and 500 Drachmas.
At the end of every box he fastened a long rope with a piece of cork at the
end; by which floating above the water, the money if by shipwreck it were lost
might be espied again: which were not much unlike the buoyes which Mariners
fasten by long ropes to their anchors, that they may be the sooner found. The
pretense of the Romans to this country was very weak, Avarius magis quam
iustius sumus assecuti, are the words of Sextus Rufus. Cyprus being made a
Roman Province, was in the division of the Empire assigned to the
Constantinopolitan Emperor, Turk. hist.
and governed by a succession of Dukes, till the year 1184. At this time,
Andronicus Comnenius usurping the Greek Empire, compelled Isaacius Comnenius,
one of the blood royal to shift for himself; who seasing on this Island made
himself king hereof, and ruled till the year 1191. In which Richard the first
of England, being denied the common courtesy of taking in fresh water; and
seeing the Soldiers abused by the Cypriots, not only took the King prisoner,
but subdued the whole Island. And as Paterculus tells us, that when Marcus
Antonius had captiued Artamasdes king of Armenia, Catenis, sed ne quid honori
d^esse, aureis vinxit. So did our Richard keep herein a decorum toward this
prisoner, binding him not in bonds of iron, but silver. King Richard having
thus possessed himself of this Country, sold it for ready money, (which for the
managing of his intended wars against the Turks he most needed) unto the
Templers; and taking it upon I know not what discontent again from them, he
bestowed it on Guy of Lusignan, the titulary and miserable king of Jerusalem,
receiving in way of exchange the title of that lost and shipwraced kingdom,
with which title he and some of his successors were for a time honored. In
the posterity of this Guy, this Island continued free and absolute till the
year 14^3, when Melechella (or Melech^aset) Sultan of Egypt, invaded this
Country, took John, king hereof prisoner, ransomed him for 150000 Sultanies,
restored him to his kingdom, and imposed on him and his successors, the
yearly tribute of 40000 crowns. This John was father to another John, whose
two children were Carlotte a legitimate daughter, and James a bastard son.
James after the death of his father, dispossessed his sister Carlotte of the
Crown, by the consent and help of the Sultan of Egypt; and the better to
strengthen himself against all opposition, he took to wise Catharina Cornerie,
daughter by adoption to the Venetian Senate. Her, he dying made his absolute
heir; and she seeing the factious nobility, too headstrong to be bridled by
a female authority, like a good child, resigned her Crown and Scepter to the
Venetian Senate, An. 1473. These defended it against all claims (paying only
as tribute to the Egyptian, and after to the Turkish Sultans, the 40000
Crowns) till the year 1570; when Mustapha general of the Turks wrested it
from the Venetians to the use of his master Selimus the second, who pretended
title to it as Lord of Egypt. The governor of the Venetian forces at the time
of this unfortunate loss, was Signior Bragadino; who as long as hope of
succors, means of resistance, or possibility of prevailing continued: with
incredible valor made good the town of Famagusta, in whose defense consisted
the welfare of the whole Island. At last he yielded it on honorable
conditions, had they been as faithfully kept, as sincerely agreed on. For
Mustapha the Turkish General inuiting to his Tent the principal men of worth
in the Town, caused them all to be murdered: and as for Bragadino himself, he
commanded his ears to be cut off, his body to be flead alive, and his skin
stuffed with straw to be hanged at the maine yard of his galley. The chief of
the prisoners and spoils, were in two tall ships and one gallion sent unto
Selimus, but he never saw them: for a noble Cyprian Lady destinated to the
lust of the Grand Signieur; fired certain barrells of powder; by the violence
whereof both vessels and booty were in part burned, in part drowned. A famous
and heroicke act. The year after this loss, the Venetians won the battle of
Lepanto; which so fleshed them, that they said that their little loss in that
fight was but as a bloodletting for the general good: but a Turk ingeniously
compared the loss of Cyprus to the loss of an arm, which could not without a
miracle be recovered; and the loss of Lepanto battle to the shauing of ones
beard, whose hair grows the thicker: For the next year the Turk showed his
Armada whole and entire, brauing with it the whole Christian forces.

What the revenue of this Island is I cannot certainly determine. Maginus.
The profits of salts only and the custom house yielded to the Signeur of
Venice, when it was in their hands, a million of Crowns yearly. For these
customs and profits were farmed for 500000 Crowns a year, which being turned
into the chief Cypriot commodities, were at their vnlading in Venice counted
double worth the money. To this add the lands belonging to the former kings,
and now by deuolution to this state; and the revenue cannot but be much more.

OF RHODES.
RHODOS, or RHODES, is situate in the Carpathian Sea, over against Caria a
Province of lesser Asia. It is in circuit 120 miles, and takes denomination
from Rhodes the chief City, honored with the mighty Colossus; made by Chares
of Liudum, in the space of 12 years. This Colossus was made in the image of a
man, being 80 cubits high, and so big that the little finger of it was as
big as an ordinary man: the brass of this statua was so much, that when
Mnaui general of Caliph Osmen, united this I Will to the Mahumetan Empire; it
loaded 900 Camels. This image was made in honor of the Sun, who once a day
at least kisseth this Island; be the air in all other places never so ouercast
with clouds: And it is by some said that from hence the people were called
Colossians. Whether this be a truth or a conjecture I wot not, certainly they
were not those Colossians, to whom S. Paul directed one of his Epistles, they
being inhabiters of Anatolia, and there have we made mention of them.

The people of this I Will were always very expert in maritine affairs, and are
called by Florus, Populus Nauticus. They aided the Romans against Philip king
of Macedon; and when all the other Islands of the Mediterranean revolted to
Mithridates of Pontus, this only adhered to the Romans. And Pate^culus in
expressing the hard terms of the Roman state in the war against king
Perseus; brings it in for almost a miracle, that Rhodij ipsi fidelissimi
antea Romany, dubiaiam fide, proniores in Regis parts visi sunt. It fell in
division of the Empire to the Graecians, from whom the Sarracens took it and
held it, til that the knights of S. John in Jerusalem, being utterly driven
out of Asia by the Turks, ceased on it; 1308. These knights sorely infested
the Turks till the year 1522, in which Solomon the Magnificent invaded it;
and Lilladamus Villiers being great Master desended it as far as humane
puissance, or warlike policy could extend; but multitude ouermastred valor,
and on Christmas day, the Turk entered Rhodes as conqueror. Though he might say
(as Pyrrhus once said of his victory over the Romans) that such another victory
as that would have undone him; he lost so many of his best Soldiers, and
brauest commanders. The Town Rhodes whereof the Island takes its name, and on
whose strength both formerly and at this time dedendeth the welfare of the
whole Island; is situate on the East part of the I Will, on the bottom of a hill,
and the brinke of the Sea: so that it enjoys a fair and a safe haven for
commodity, and for strength has two walls, 13 high Towers, 5 bulwarks, besides
diverse sconces and outworks; this town and Famagusta being indeed the two most
defensible holds in all the Turkish Empire. It is inhabited only by Turks and
Jews, the Christians having free commerce and traffice in it all the day time:
but on pain of death leaving it at the night time. It was formerly a famous
University, this Rhodes, Marseils, Alexandria, Athens, and Tarsus being the
old Academies of the Roman Monarchy: and hither Tiberius withdrew himself,
when Augustus had declared Caius and Lucius to be his heirs; pretending only a
desire to study, whereas the true cause was his envy of the young Princes
preferments.

West of Rhodes, between it and Crete, lies Carpathos, an Island of 70 miles
circuit, now called Scarpanto: famous only in causing the adjacent waters to be
called the Carpathian Sea.

THE END OF ASIA.
OF AFRICA.
AFRICA is a Peninsula, Maginus.
encompassed almost round; with the Red Sea on the East, the Atlanticke Ocean
on the West, the Southern Ocean on the South, and the Mediterranean on the
North. Where the Sea is defective, to make it a co^pleat Island, there is a
little Isthmus which tieth it to Asia. This Isthmus is but 60 miles in length,
so that diverse have begun a Trench to let in the Mediterranean: as first
Sesostris; secondly Darius the King of Persia and Egypt; thirdly one of the
Ptolomies; and fourthly a capricious Portugal; that an easier way might be
found toward India, and the Eastern Countries: but they all desisted on the
same reason, viz: lest the Sea (being observed to be higher then Egypt) should
sometimes ouer-flow the Country, Plutarch.
and spoil the waters of Egypt. A greater project then this we now recited,
was by Cleopatra the last Queen of the Ptolomean line in Egypt, attempted on
this Isthmus, which was this: When Mark Antonie was by Augustus encountered in
the Navall battle at Actium, Cleopatra fearing the success, fled out of the
battle with the 60 ships appointed to her guard. Being come to the North part
of this Isthmus, she gathered together all her portable riches, and intended to
hoist her shipping out of the Mediterranean sea, and hale them over this
Isthmus into the Red sea: whence she had intended to take sail, and together
with her Antonie, and some of her choice fri^nds, to seek out some new
habitation, far from the danger and bondage, which the present war threatened.
But from this, Ant^ni^, (who vainly hoped for a change of fortune) disswade^
her.

The form of Afric is like a Pyramid reversed, Boterus*
the Basis whereof is in breadth 1920 miles, the Conis very narrow; but from
the Pyris or Conis, to the Basis, it extends it self the space of 4155
miles, being much less then Asia, and far bigger then Europe.

The old Geographers knew very little of this Country, supposing most or all
beyond mount Atlas, not to be inhabited; because it is situate under the Torrid
Zone, and therefore took its name from (...) and (...), that is, without cold.
Pomponius Mela guessed the more inward parts thereof to be inhabited with
strange people, as 1 Augilae, whose wives on the marriage night, used to
prostitute themselves to all comers; she being had in most honor, which had
that night accompanied most men. But after that night, conjugal chastity was
highly prized among them. 2 Gampsaphantes, a naked people, and ignorant of the
use of weapons. 3 Blem^^^^, who being without heads, had their eyes and mouth
in their breasts: and 4 Aegypani, who (shape only excepted) had no other humane
quality to show they were men. These people (as he thought) possessed some
small part of the Country; the rest he knew not, or with others deemed it
inhabitable. But later discoueries have seen the contrary, finding the Country
to be frequently inhabited; and the coolenes of the nights, by the Mists,
Dewes, and gentle gales of wind, to parallel the heat of the Day. Quodque die
Solis violento excanduit aestu,
Humida nox reficit, paribusque refrigerat horis.
What is by Day Sunburned, the Night renewes,
And just as much does cool with pea^ly dewes.
The Country howsoever is full of sandy deserts, and uncouth wildernesses, full
of Lions, Leopards, Elephants, Crocodiles, Sea-horses, Hyaena's, and such like:
which caused this old proverb, Africa semper aliquid apportat novi.

How Africa distracted with several Principates, came under the power of the
Romans; shall be specified in diverse places. The Romans continued Lords of it,
until the year 428, Theodosius the second then commanding the East, and
Valentinian the West: for in that year the Vandals seized on it. The Vandals,
o^ Vind^lici, were a people of Germany, and were possessours of that part which
is now called Sueviae. They were called into Gallia by Stilico, whom Theodosius
the Great had left as ouer-seer to his son Honorius. They accepted this
invitation partly on hope of a more fruitful soil, partly to avoid the fury
of the Hunnes and Goths; who yet tormented them, chasi^g them out of Gaul,
into Spain. With them entered the Suevi and the Alani: the Suevi had to king,
Hermeric; the Vandals, Gundericus; and the Alani, Atace. The battle of Merida
ruinated the power of those nations; so that the Vandals could not but
willingly accept the offer of Bonifacius, the Emperors Vicegerent in Africa;
who stomaching to see his office bestowed on Castinus, an unworthy man, and his
Enemy; betrayed the Country to these Vandals, in the last year of the life and
reign of Gundericus.

The Vandall Kings of Africa.
412 1 Gundericus 16 428 2 Gensericus, who at the request of Eudocia, the widow
of Valentinian, invaded Italy, sacked the city of Rome, the spoil whereof for
14 days he gave to his soldiers; but at the request of Eudocia, whom he
afterward married, he did not burn it. This Eudocia was wife to the Western
Emperor Valentinian; who having a mind to a Lady of Rome, the wife of one
Maximus; he cunningly slipped Maximus Ring off his finger, and by that token
sent for the Lady to come to Court, and when she was come, ravished her. To
revenge this disgrace, Maximus slew Valentinian, made himself Emperor, and
forced Eudocia to be his wife. But she stomaching a match so unequal to her
high birth, and having some incling of the manner of her husbands death, sent
for Gensericus into Italy. This Gensericus conquered Carthage, and Hippo, and
reigned 40 years. 476 3 Honoricu^ 7 484 4 Gundamundus. 12 499 5 Thr. ^imundus
24 523 6 Hildericus 7. 530 7 Gilmer. 5. This King was overcome by Belisaruis a
worthy and politic Leader, whom the Emperor Justinian employed in this
service. And thus ended the Kingdom of the Vandals, having continued 146
years.
Belisarius, after this good service, was employed by Justinian against the
Goths then reigning in Italy; against whom he proceeded very fortunatly. But
being on I know not what envy called to Constantinople, his eyes were put out,
and he was feign to beg his bread, at the gate of the Temple of S. Sophia. A
bad reward for so good a servant.

Hist. of Sp.
The Goths of Spain as little loved the neighborhood of the Romans in Africa,
as formerly of the Vandals; whereupon King Theude, in the last year of his
reign, sent an army against them. Those Soldiers on a superstitious fear,
would not fight on the Sunday: but the Romans having no such scruple, assaulted
them, and put them all to the sword; leaving not one to carry news of this
overthrow. I dare not so far put my sickle into this Harvest, as to limit out
the extent of Sabboth-keeping; which commanding us to do no work, does seem
to prohibit us to work for our own safeguard. Neither can I impute this
abstinence from defense, to Religion, but superstition: for works of necessity
are allowed by the best Divines, as consonant to Gods Word, to be done on that
day. But on a mere fancy to destroy our selves, and bereave God of that glory,
which resistance might yield in such a case; is not only not commanded, but
forbidden by piety and Christian policy. So was it by our Savior, permitted to
his Disciples, to pluck the ears of corn on the Sabbath day; and the drawing
of the Ox and the Ass out of the ditch, is allowed by him which was Lord of
the Sabbath. If then it be lawful to take from Gods service some part of that
day, for the safety of our cattle, and the necessary sustenance of our own
lives: then much more doubtl^sse are we bound, on that day also to provide for
the defense of our Country, which (as Tully says) Omnes omnium charitates
complectitur. The ancient Jews were in this kind so vainly scrupulous, that
when Hi^rusalem was by Pompey besieged, they on that day omitted all kind of
resistance, which the politic Captain observing, used no assault on the week
days; but Saturday being come, with all his forces he assaulted the Town, and
in the end on that day, took it. Upon the same advantage, was it afterward
taken by Sosius and Herod; and on the same, a third time, by Titus Vespasian:
the Jews being all this while so superstitiously sottish, that no example or
danger would move them to repulse the enemy. So truly was it said of Dion.
(...): Etita (Iudaei) nihil quicquam perpugnantes, in potestatem hostium die
Saturni venerunt More discreet, and in my judgment, no less religious was the
decree of Mattathias, the father of the Maccabees; when he saw that 1000 of his
Countrymen, had on the Sabbath bin slain by Antiochus Soldiers; they not
casting a stone at them: which was, that whosoever shall come to make battle
with us on the Sabbath day, we will fight against him, neither will we die all
as our brethren did, that were murdered in the secret places. Now concerning
the other works allowed on this day, as those of charity and Religion,
together with those of magnificence, (as the adorning of our bodies with our
better raiment, and the furnishing of our Tables with more hospitable
provision) I will here say nothing, as not pertaining to my story of the Goths
discomfiture, whose superstition occasioned me to digress so far. To
conclude all, let me tell you how a Jew (which people to this day do very
strictly and superstitiously observe their Sabbath) being at Alexandria, and
refusing to take ship, when the wind served very happily to sail into
Palestine, because it was Saturday; the better to cosen his conscience, hired
a Ianizary to beat him aborde; which task the Ianizary partly in love to
knavery, and partly in hate to the Nation, performed not by halfes, and in
jest; but lashed him sorely, and to the purpose.

After this overthrow of the Goths, and the subversion of this Vindelician
kingdom; Africa continued Roman, till their utter expulsion by Hucba a famous
Leader; whom Osmen the third Caliph of the Saracens, destinated to the conquest
of this Country. Of the translation of which Empire, thus Du Bartas.

OF BARBARY.
Pur^ha^.
BARBARY, so called by the Saracens from Barbar, signifying a murmuring sound,
(for so seemed the old language to the new Conquerours) has on the East,
Cyrenaica; on the West, the Atlanticke Ocean; on the North, the Mediterranean;
on the South, the hill Atlas. It comprehends the Countries anciently called
Numidia antiqua, Africa propria, Mauritania Caesariensis, and Tingitana; now it
is usually divided into the kingdoms of 1 Tunis, 2 Algeirs, 3 Fesse, and 4
Morocco: all which are of like fertility, and peopled with the like inhabitants.

The fertility consists in Fruits, Figs, Olives, Dates, Sugar, and Horses
of excellent beauty, strength, and service.

The men are of a duskish color, comely of body, stately of gate, implacable
in hatred, constant in affection, laborious, and treacherous: The women
sumptuous in jewels, beautiful in blacknes, having delicate soft skins.

its own jurisdiction. 3 Ezzab, wherein is the City Cairaon, built by Hucba, who
being Captain-Generall to Osmen, the fourth Saracenicall Caliph, subdued all
Barbary. His posterity governed it 170 years, when Escan, his last successor
was slain by Maladi one of his Captains: from whom Joseph King of Morocco,
violently withheld it; after which it followed the fortune of Tunis. 4
Trip^lis, so called because of the three prime Cities, Abroton, Taphia, and
Leptis. This Tripolis, and its Province, was by the Genoys taken from the king
of Tunis, and sold to him of Fesse: from whom, when they of Tunis had regained
it, it fell into the hands of Ferdinando, king of Castile; whose Nephew Charles
the fifth, gave it to the kings of Malta; and they not long after, were forced
to leave it, by the valor of Sinan Bassa, Lieftenant to Selim the second, Anno
1551.

The fifth Province is Tunis, whose chief Cities were 1 Vtica, where Cato
killed himself, now called Biserta. 2 Madaura, where Apuleius was borne. 3
Thystrus, Herodotus.
where Gordianus the elder was saluted Emperor, by the young men of this
Province: who having in a tumult murdered their Procurator, and well knowing the
cruelty of Maximinus then Emperor; saw no course so suiting with their
desperate states, as to wipe out their present treason, with an attempt of
higher nature; and thereupon compel this Gordianus, Proconsul of Afric, to
take upon him the Empire. This act, as it was pleasing to the Nobles and
commons of Rome; so was it as distasteful to Maximinus, and his faction.
Capellianus an other of his Procurators, with a sufficient army, set upon and
ouer-threw the inexpert Africans: and slew in the battle, the son of the
new Emperor: who ^earing this lamentable report, and fearing the inexorable
nature of his enemy, hanged himself. 4 Carthage. The Country was peopled by
the Phoenicians, as fled from the victorious swords of Joshua, and the
Israelites. To these long after, Dido sister to Pigma^eon joined her Tyrian
troops, and built this City, A.M. 3078; before the building of Rome, 135
years* This Town stood just opposite to Rome, whose Rival it was in wealth,
valor, and desire of the universal Empire. Vrbs antiqua fuit (Tyrij tenuere
Colon^)
Carthago, Italiam contra, Tyberinaque long
Ostia, dives opum, studijsque asperrima belli.
There wa^s an ancient City called as then
Carthage, and built by banished Tyrian men,
Just against old Tibers mouth, and Italy;
Great in wealth, skilled in martial chivalry.
It contained 21 miles in circuit: the Citizens were called Poeni, and are
still infamous for their perjury, and false hearted dealing. That they were of
the Canaanitish race, may be proved, 1 by the name Poeni, or Phoeni, little
differing from the Phoenices. 2ly we find in Herodotus, how Cambises having
totally conquered Egypt, intended a war against the Carthaginians, who were
then a state (it seems) of some power; but the Phoenicians, being the only
seafaring men, Cambises then had absolutely denied to be agents in that
service; they being sprung from the same tree that the Carthaginians were. 3ly
we read in Procopius, (out of whom it is cited by Evagrius Scholasticus) how on
two marble pillars, situate nigh unto Tingis, or Tanger, there was in the
Phoenician language and character engraued, Nos fugimus a facie Iosuah
praedonis, filij Nave. This last we before touched.

The Commonwealth of Carthage was in these parts so potent, that they strove
with the Romans tooth and nail for the Empire of the World, but lost their
own liberty, being overthrown in 3 several wars by the Romans. The first
was for the possession of Sicilie, Sardinia, and Corsica: The second was begun
by Hannibal, who terrified the Romans with many fatal ouer-throwes; but was at
last overcome by Scipio, having kept the Romans work 18 years; and then this
great City submitted. But being unwilling to endure such a mutation, from being
Queen of Africa, to be a handmaid to Rome, she again revolted, and was utterly
razed to the ground. Caesar after rebuilt it, and planted therein a Colonie of
the Roman people. It grew in small time to be frequently inhabited, and
abounding in riches: yet so far from her ancient reputation, that her chief
glory was to be rather sought in her ancient, then present fortunes. Populi
Romani colonia, olim imperij eius pertinax aemula; and priorum excidio rerum,
quam open praesentium clarior: was her true character in the Geographer Mela's
days. Long after this in the flourishing of Christianity in these parts, the
Archbishop hereof had under his jurisdiction 120 Suffragan Bishops. Out of the
ruins and cinders of Carthage, finally destroyed by the Vandals, and Saracens;
like the young Phoenix out of her dams ashes, arose Tunis, a City of 9000
families, seated nigh unto a most delicate safe harbor, Boterus.
which the Spaniard^ strengthened with the fort of Goletta: which, after they
had consumed 40 years in building, was by the continual labor of the Turks
leuelled with the ground in 39 days.

This Country was called Numidia, containing also Africa propria, and was the
Kingdom of Masinissa, whom his son Micipsa succeeded; after whose death,
Iugurth having killed his brethren Adherbal, and Hiempsal, manfully withstood
the Romans; whose attempts sometimes by force, sometimes by subtilty but
chiefly by money and bribes, he ouer-threw and made frustrate: and fuit in
Iugurtha (says Florus) quod post Annibalem timeretur. At last being broken by
Metellus, vanquished by Marius, and by Boechus delivered into the hands of
Sylla: he was by Marius led in triumph unto Rome. In this triumph was carried
3700 pound weight in gold; in silver wedges 5775 pound weight; and in ready
coin, 28700 Crowns: it being the custom of the Romans in their triumphs, to
have carried before them all the riches and money, which they had brought out
of conquered Countries, to put into the common Treasury. Thus besides others
did Paulus Aemylius, when triumphing for his victory over Perseus king of
Macedon, he caused the ready money which he had brought out of Greece, to be
carried in 750 vessels; every vessel (as Plutarch relates) containing 3
talents: a mass of treasure so infinite, that the Roman people were for many
years after, free from all kind of tax and imposition.

After the death of Iugurth, who at Rome was starued in prison; Numidia was
given to some of the confederate Kings of the Romans; whose guise it was (as
Tacitus notes) habere servitulis instrumenta etiam reges. The first King was
Hiempsal, who relieved Marius in exile: the second was Hiarba, an other of the
Marian faction, vanquished by Sylla's Captains. The third was a second
Hiempsal, son (if I e^re not) to Bacchus King of Mauritania: to who^ Sylla
gave this Province. The last was Iuba, son to this Hiempsal, of whom, more
annon: who being slain, Numidia was made a Roman Province, Crispus Salustius
being the first Lieftenant of it. The Romans lost it to the Saracens, after
whose conquest this Province had many Kings, all forced to bow under the
command of the Kings of Morocco: one of whose Deputies in these Countries,
usurped the sovereignty, and left it entire to his posterity: who peaceably
enjoyed it, till Muleasses the youngest son of Mahomet, having killed his eldest
brother, and put out the eyes of 20 of the other, took on him the kingdom.
Roseta the only one, which escaped this massacre, by the aid of Solomon the
magnificent, regained, and was enforced to leave it as a prey to Muleasses, by
the valor of Charles the fifth, and his Castilians, Anno 1535. After many
troubles this tyrant had his eyes put out by his son Amida. He was dispossessed
by his brother Mahomet: In whose life, the Turks razed the Spanish fort of
Goletta; and after his death, succeeded him in his kingdom of Tunis.

Dion.
ALGIRS, ARGEIRS, or TESESINE, was of old called Mauritania Caesariensis;
Mauritania, from the Mauri, who inhabited it, and the Western tract: and
Caesariensis from the chief City Caesarea. This City was by a more ancient name
called Iol, and was the seat of K. Bacchus; who betrayed his friend Iugurth, to
L. Sylla; who in regard of this service, did afterward enrich Hiempsal, the son
of this Bacchus, by giving him the kingdom of Numidia also. His son Iuba
^iding with Pompey (the heir of Sylla's faction) in the civil wars, gave a
great ouer-throw to Curio, Caesar's Lieftenant in Afric, Curio himself being
slain, his whole Army routed, and such as were taken prisoners murdered in cold
blood. He was after the overthrow and death of Pompey, encountered and
discomfited by Caesar himself; who presently made Numidia a Province of the
Empire, giving Mauritania to Bacchus and Bogud, two of his consederates. These
continued not long friends: for during the succeeding Triumvirate, Bacchus
dispossessed Bogud of his part, and was confirmed in both by Augustus Caesar:
but he suddenly after dying, the whole Country of Mauritania, as well this
called Caesariensis, as that other called Tingitana, were Provinces of the
Roman Empire, and so it continued, till the Vandals, and after them the
Saracens made havoc of it.

This kingdom, Maginus.
bounded on the East with Tunis, and on the West, with Fess and Morocco,
contameth these five principal Cities; 1 Hubeda. 2 Tegdenit. 3 Guagido. 4
Argeirs, a Town not so large as strong; and not so strong as famous. Famous
for being the receptacle and retrait-place of the Turkish Pirates, who domineere
so infinitely over the Mediterranean, to the great damage of the Merchants of
all Nations, that frequent those seas: As also for the shipwreck which Charles
the fifth here suffered; who besieging this Town, lost in the Haven of it at
one tempest, besides an infinite number of karvels and small boats, diverse
strong Galleyes, 140 Ships, a great many excellent pieces of Ordinance, such a
number of gallant horses, that in Spain, the race of horses for service was
like to have been lost for ever, and above half his men. It is situate in or
nigh unto the place of Iol, ot Caesarea; and is esteemed to contain about 1000
families. The buildings are very sumptuous; the innes, bathes, and temples very
beautiful; and every occupation has a several place or street by it self.
These long enjoyed the benefit of proprietary Princes, till such times as
Selimes, and Mahomet, falling out, made the first, and that an irreparable
breach in the government; for Selimes to strengthen his side, implored the aid
of Hairaccius Barbarossa, a noble Pirat; who taking his best advantage, slew
the dis^oincted brethren, and settled himself in the kingdom; which he had
scarce made warm, when he left it to Hairadine Barbarossa his brother, Ao
1514. This Hairadine drove the Spaniards out of Bugia, and was so renowned for
martial prowess, that Solomon the Magnificent made him Lord high Admiral of
his Fleet; which office, when to the prejudice of Christendom, he had
fortunatly and for long time undergone; he died lamented, and made the Turko
his heir in the kingdom.

The 5 City is Telesine, which grew from the ruins of Haresgol, to that
greatness, that it contained 16000 families. In the distracted decay of the
Saracenicall Empire, many petty Governors vsu^ped the Majesty of a kingly
title; and amongst the rest, this City, with the confining territory, boasted
in the presence of a peculiar Prince. But this cause of joy endured not long
For Abulthasen, king of Fesse, much impaired the Majesty of the kingdom, by
making it ^ubiect to his command: which when they discontentedly obeyed, they
at last made a general revolt, and assumed their liberty, under diverse kings
of their own City: one of which was Abucbemen, who incurring a general
hatred, because by reason of his supine neglect, Ferdinando King of Castile had
surprised and fortified Oram and Masalquiuer, two commodious Havens; made an
easy passage for his brother Ahuzeiden, to the Diadem. This Ahuzeiden was
vanquished by Hairadine Barbarossa, Anno 1515: who was driven back by the
valor of Charles the fifth; and Abuchemen restored: his successor Abdalla,
shaking off all allegiance to the Spaniard, submitted himself, and after his
death, the kingdom of Tel^sine, to the tuition of Solomon the magnificent.
This City Telesine, is adorned with many beautiful temples, though defiled
with superstition, and has five dainty colleges, curiously wrought with
Mosaique work. It seems to have been strong, in that we find how it
sustained a siege of 7 years, by Joseph the puissant King of Fesse, and in the
end forced him to raise it: neither was it taken by the aboue-named Abuthasen,
under a siege of 30 months. The second Town of note is Batha, now almost
ruined by war. 3 Cran, a Town of 10000 families, taken by Peter of Navarre
for the Spaniards, 1509, and in vain besieged by the Turk 1562. 5 Masalquivir
or Masala^bir, a most famous Hauen-towne, taken also by the Spaniards, about
the same time.

The chief rivers of these two Countries are 1 Mayor, parting Tunis from
Algiers; 2 Zan, and Malvi^, dividing Algeirs from Fesse and Morocco.

FESSE and MOROCCO were once comprehended under the general name of Mauritania
Tingitana, so called of Tingis (now Tanger) a principal Town in those days,
and was that part of Mauritania, which Julius Caesar having discomfited Iuba,
Dion.
gave unto Bogud one of his associats How this, and the other part of
Mauritania, became one R^m^n P^ou^nce, we have already told you; as for the
division of it i^to the two Provinces, this of Tingitana, and that other of
Caesa^^nsis, it was made by Claudius, who having pacified some tu^ul^^ in this
Country, thus divided it, and appointed the government of it to two Roman
Knights.

These two Kingdoms have on the East, Algeirs; on the West, the Atlanticke
Ocean; and are parted one from the other, by the river Marbea, or Omirable. The
other rivers of note are 2 Tensilt. 3 Sus. 4 Subu. 5 Lyssus.

FESSE is divided into 7 Provinces, in which the chief Cities are 1 Fesse, (so
called from Fesse, i. Gold, abundance whereof was found in digging the
foundation) was built by Id^e a Mahumetan Prince. It is divided by the river
Sabu into 3 parts, all of which contain 82000 households, and 700 Moschees, or
Saracenicall Temples: the chief of which is Carne, or Caraven, being a mile
and a half in compass. It has 31 gates, great and high, the roof is 150
yards long, and 80 broad; round about are diverse porches, containing 40 yards
in length, and 30 in breadth; under which are the public storehouses of the
town. About the walls are pulpits of diverse sorts, wherein the Masters of
their Law read unto the people such things as they think pertain to their
salvation. The revenue hereof is 200 ducats a day on the old rents, for so
much it was, Anno 1526 when Leo Afer wrote. The Merchants have there a Court or
Exchange, enclosed with a strong wall, with 12 Gates, and 15 streets. There is
also a College called Amarodoc, a most curious and delicate building: It has
three Cloisters of admirable beauty, supported with 8 square pillars of diverse
colors; the roof curiously carved, and the arches of Mosaique, of gold and
azure. The gates are of brass, fairly wrought; and the doors of the private
chambers, of inlayed work. This College did cost the Founder King Abuchenen,
or Abu Henen, 480000 Crowns, 2 Ham Lisnan, a Town built in the more
mountainous parts of the Country, by the old Africans, famous for the Temple of
an Idol here worshipped; to which at certain times men and women resorted in
the night; where, after their devotions ended, and the c^ndles put out, every
man lay with the woman he first touched: the exact platform of the Family of
Love 3 Septa, or S^nta, a town in the hands of Spain. 4 Tanger, called of old
Tingis, nigh unto which, Hercules killed Anteus. 5 Mahenes. 6 Alcazer Guer,
nigh unto which the three Kings, Sebastian of Portugal, Mahomet, and
Abdelmelech, competitors for this kingdom, were slain in one day. There was
slain at the same time also, Camd. Eliz.
the great English rebel, Stuckley: who fled out of Ireland to Rome, Anno
1570, where he was by the then Pope, lovingly welcomed, as a dutiful son to
the Church. He was by the Pope appointed for the Conquest of Ireland, and was
for that end furnished with a troop of 800 soldiers, paid by the King of
Spain; and was by his unholy Holiness, created Marquess of Lemster, Earl of
Wexford and Caterlogh, Vicount Murraugh, and Baron Rosse. Thus prepared, he
began his voyage, Anno 1578, toward Ireland: but hearing of the wars in this
Country, and desirous to make a part in them, he lost here (the Popes fatherly
benediction notwithstanding) not his soldiers only, but his own life. and 7
Aguer.

MOROCCO is divided into 7 Provinces, the chief Cities of which are Morocco,
Purchase.
built by Abderamen; once the Metropolis of Barbary, as containing 100000
households: but now inferior to Fesse for populousness, spaciousness, and
beauty. The chief buildings hereof, are the Church and the Castle. The Church
is bigger, though not so beautiful as that at Fesse; and has a Tower so high,
that the hills of Azasi, being 130 miles distant, may be thence easily
discerned. The Castle is very large, and on a Tower thereof stand 3 Globes,
made of pure gold, weighing 130000 Barbary Ducats. Diverse kings have gone
about to take them down, and convert them into money: but have all desisted,
by reason of some strange misfortune that has bin inflicted on them: so that
the common people think they are kept by a guard of spirits. 2 Tangouista. 3
Fesodet. 4 Taradent. 5 Massa, abounding in Amber: and 6 Alarach.

When the Saracens had overrun Barbary, there came into these parts two
potent Families, viz: the Marine, and Lan^une Families: of the later was
Abderamen, who having builded Morocco, surprised and took Fesse from the
contentious sons of Idre. The two kingdoms were thus jointly governed, till
the year 1212; in which, when Alphonso King of Castile had slain King Mahomet
Enaser; and his sons were at odds about the inheritance: one Habdulach, of
the Marine Family, made himself King of Fesse; and by the valor of his son
Joseph, made Morocco tributary. This Habdulach by co^putation of time, seems
to be the Admiralius Murmelius, mentioned by Matthew Paris, to whom our King
John, Anno 1214, sent such a base, degenerous, and vnchristian-like embassage.
This strange name Admiralius Murmelius, was by that good Writer unhappily
stumbled on, instead of Miramumalim; which also is corrupted from Amir
Elmumenin, that is, princeps fidelium; an attribute which these Princes as yet
retain. The story is this. King John being ouer-laide in his Barons wars,
sent certain Ambassadors to this great Monarch for aid; offering to hold his
kingdom of him, and to receive the Law of Mahomet. The Moore maruailously
offended with this offer, told the Ambassadors, that he had lately read Paul's
Epistles, which he liked so well, that were he now to choose a Religion, he
would before any other embrace Christianity; but every one ought (said he) to
die in his own Religion, and for leaving the Faith wherein he was borne, was
the only thing which he disliked in that Apostle. This said, he called unto
him Robert of London, Clearke, one of that Embassy, of whom he demanded the
form of our government, the wealth and situation of the Country, the manners
of the people, the life and person of the King; in all which particulars being
satisfied, he grew into such a dislike of our king, that ever after he abhorred
the mention of him. In the posterity of this Habdulach, the two Kingdoms
remained, till the year 1508, when as Mahomet Ben Amet, called by his own
command Xeriff, (which is the name that the lineall successors, and kindred of
Mahomet are called by) being a poor Hermit, plotted to make his sons the
chief Princes of Mauritania Tingitana. For this cause, he sent them in
pilgrimage to Mecha, whence they returned with such an opinion of Sanctity,
that the King of Fesse made Amet, one of them, Governor of the famous College
Amadorac; and Mahomet, the other, Tutor to his children: the younger, Abdel,
staying at home with their father. In those days, the Portugals grievously
infested the tributary kingdom of Morocco* to repress whose fury, Amet and
Mahomet, asked and obtain^d License. They discomfite Lopes Barriga, and his
Portugals; they subdue Sus, Hean, and Dencalie, three great Provinces; they
enter Morocco, poison the King, and salute Amet the Xeriff of Morocco. To
further their future victories, the King of Fesse dies, and Amet his
successor confirmed this Amet in his new purchased royalty.

The Xeriffs of Barbary.
1 Amet denied superiority, to Amet of Fess, whom he ouer-threw, and was slain
by his own brother. 1540 2 Mahomet, who united the kingdom of Fess to
Morocco. 1557 3 Abdela. 4 Abdela II, had 10 brothers, of which he slew 8. Amet
was spared for his supposed simplicity; and Abdelmelech escaped to the Turks.
5 Mahomet, expelled by Abdelmelech and the Turks, ^led to Sebastian King of
Portugal; who, together with the two competitors, was slain in one day, nigh
unto Alcager Guer. 1578 Hamet* who extended his Empire to Lybia and Numidia.
1603 The three sons of Hamet, viz: Muley-Shecke, Boferes, and Sidan, Purchase.
contended for the Kingdom. In these wars, Boferes, and Muley died; but
Abdela, son to Muley-Shecke, maintained the wars against Sidan. During
these troubles, Sidan Hamet, Ben Abdelan, a Hermit of great prowess, seized
on the City of Morocco, from whence he was compelled to retire, by the valor*
of Prince Sidan, and Side Hean, another Hermit, Anno 1616. And thus stands
the state of the Xeriffia^t^ Sidan enjoys the City Morocco; Side Hean has
fortified himself in Tar^dant; Abd^la lives by robberies; Fesse stands on
her guard; and the other towns are governed by peculiar Magistrates: what the
event will be, is uncertain.
The reuen^es of the Xeriff^ are very great, which they leuy out of the tenths
of their subjects grain, besides a Duck at for every Pole, male or female,
above 15 years of age: in Merchandise he receaueth of a Citizen, two in the
hundred; of 2 stranger, ten: Church and College lands are escheated to him;
Judges make him their heir, etc.

What for^e they are able to draw into the field, may evidently be seen in
the siege of Magaza^, Grimston.
a town of Fesse, but in possession of the Spaniards* which he beleagured with
200000 men. Yet can he not hold any war above three months, because the
Soldiers live upon his daily allowance, whose provision not being able to be
carried continually with them, make them many times to retire.

Thus much of Barbary.

NVMIDIA AND LYBIA.
BEfore we come to Numidia, we must pass over Mount Atlas (now called
Anch^sae, Stephanus.
or Montes Clari) a hill of that height, that the top of it cannot be seen.
It deriues its name, from Atlas king of Mauritania, who dwelt in the bottom of
it: whom the Poets feign, to be by Perseus turned into this hill. The daughters
of this Atlas, dwelt in the Islands Hesperides, situate in the Atlanticke Ocean;
where they had a tree which bore a golden fruit, taken thence by Hercules,
after he had killed the Dragon, their guardian. Then he captiuated king Atlas
himself, who was a man of great stature, and was fained by the Poets to
sustain heaven (...) shoulders: and that, either because of his skill in
Astronomi^; or because the hill Atlas is of such height, that it seems to
touch the heavens. And so we e^ter into Numidia.

NVMIDIA ha^h on the East, Egypt; on the West, the Atlanticke Ocean; on the
North, Atlas; on the South, Lybia: the Numidia so much spoken of in the Roman
histories, is not this, but that which is now part of the kingdom of Tunis.

This Country takes its name from the Numidae, which may perhaps be so called
from their manner of life, which is after the custom of the Nomades, living
without houses, vner their Wagons, and Carts, as Lucan testifies of them.
Nulla domus, plaustris habitant, migrare per arva
Mos, atque errantes circumvectare Penates.
They dwell in waines, not houses; and do stray
Through fields, and with them lead their Gods each way.
And worthily may they owe their names to them, from whom they borrow their
nature: for the people to this day spend their lives in hunting, and stay but
three or four days in a place, as long as the grass will serve the Camells.
This is the cause why this Country is so ill peopled, the Towns so small in
themselves, and so remote from others. An example hereof is Te^set a great
City in their esteem, which yet contains but 400 households, and has no
neighbors within 300 miles of it. The Country abounds with Dates, whence it
is called Dactylorum regio, and in the Arabicke Biledulgerid, which signifies
also a Date region. These Date tree* are some male, some female; the first
brings forth only flowers; the other, fruit: yet herein is the male
beneficial to the increase of the Dates: for unless a flowred bough of the
male, be ingrafted into the female, the dates never prove good. This fruit is
the chief diet of the people; but this sweet meat has sour sauce; for it
commonly rotteth their teeth betimes: as for the stones of these Dates, they
feed their Goats with them, whereby they grow fat, and yield store of milk.
It is ill inhabited, by reason of the abundance of sands, so that in some
places the towns are 300 miles distant. The air is of that nature, that if any
one be troubled with the French disease, he shall here find present remedy.
The inhabitants are base and vile people, thieves, murderers, and ignorant of
all things: but the Arabians that are mingled with them, are ingenious,
liberal, and civil.

The chief Cities are 1 Stasilet, 2 Dausen. 3 Dara, where Mahomat Ben Amet,
and his three sons, the founders of the Xer^ffian Empire, were borne; 4
Lapsa, and 5 Teffet.

LYBIA has on the East Nilus, on the West the Atlanticke Ocean, on the North,
Numidia; and on the South the land of Neg^ce^. In this Country Arius the
heretic was borne, who being a Priest of Al^xandria, hatched that devilish
doctrine, against the pe^petuall divinity of Christ: To beat down which
h^r^sie, the first Council of Nice was called; the Nicene Creed m^d^* and the
clause of one substance with the father, proved to be consentaneous to the
word. To subscribe to the decrees of the Council, Arius was sent for by the
Emperor Constan^ine. To Const^n^inople he went, having written his own
heretical tenets, which he hid in his bosom; and reading before the Emperor
the decrees of the Council, he writ a recantation of his heresy, swearing that
he meant as he had written. Which words the Emperor referred to the
recantation, but he to the paper o^ his own tenets in his bosom. When he had
taken this oath he went in triumph through the streets of the City; till a
necessity of nature enforcing him, he withdrew aside unto a house of ease,
where he voided out his guts, and sent his soul as a harbinger to the Devil,
to provide room for his body.

In this Country lived the Garamantes, supposed to be the utmost people
Southward; and the Psylli, who were of a nature so venomous, that they could
poison a snake: Insomuch that when their wives were delivered, they would throw
their children amongst a heard of Serpents; supposing that child to be borne
of an adul^erat bed, the very smell of whose body would not drive away a whole
brood of the like poisonous vermin. This people is famoused in Herodotus for an
expedi^ion they made against the South wind. For when this wind, blowing
abroad the hills and deserts of sand, had dried up those small rilles and
waters they had among them; they to revenge this injury, by common cons^nt
armed themselves, and went to fight against (...). But they took not the South
wind v^prepared, for he ^^steri^g up his forces incountred them with such a
brave vol^^^ (...) ^and, tha^ he overwhelmed and slew them all. A better (...)
was the Northwinde to the Citizens of Rhegium, in (...) and better wa^ he
rewarded: for having scattered a mighty fleet, which Dionysius prepared against
them, he was by the common counsel made free of their City.

The name of Lybia is to be deduced either from Lybs a king of Mauritania, or
Lybs the South wind, which gently breaths from these places; or from Lybia a
Queen hereof. It is now called Sarra, which signifies a desert: for the whole
country is full of great sandy deserts, to which the violent heat of the Sun
adds continual nourishment. Hinc facta est Lybie raptis humoribus aest^
Arida -- as Ovid.
Hence Lybia, all its moisture drawn on high
By the attractiue Sun, is made so dry.
Those deserts are so tedious, that Merchants use commonly to travel eight
days, without sight of any river, lake, bush, or tree. The greatest are of
Azacad, and Zanhaga.

The people differ not much from the Numidians; but if there be a worst,
certainly it must fall to the Lybians share. They worship a God called
Psaphon, who, when he lived, taught diverse Birds which he caught, and then set
at liberty, to say, that Psaphon was a great God: whereupon the simple people,
smitten with admiration, afforded him divine worship.

The chief Cities are 1 Huaden. 2 Guargata, and 3 Toherraum.

The people in matters tending to religion, are heathens, for the most part;
but some there are of the naturalls, among who^ the Saracens, coming out of
Arabia and Barbary (Countries almost totally Mahumetan) have planted their
superstition: and in matters of policy, both these nations follow one method,
having no king nor laws; but are governed by the chief man in every Tribe.

Thus much of Numidia and Lybia.

TERRA NIGRITARVM.
TERRA NIGRITARVM, or the land of Negroes, has on the East Aethiopia superior,
o^ the West, the Atlantic Ocean; on the North, Lybia; on the Sou^^, the
kingdom of Manicongo, in Aethiopia inferior. Of this, thus the Dove, The land
of Negroes is not far from thence,
Nearer extended to the Atlanticke maine;
Wherein the black Prince keeps his residence,
Attended by his Ietty-coloured train:
Who in their native beauty most delight,
And in contempt do paint the Devil white.
The inhabitants do almost want the use of reason, most alienat from dexterity
of wit, and all arts and sciences, prone to luxury and are for the greater part
Idolaters, though not without some small admixture of Mahumetans, and
Christians. When the Portugalls first sailed into these coasts the people
hereof took their ships for great Birds with white wings: and after, upon
better acquaintance, they could not be brought to believe, but that the ey^s
which were casually painted on the back^ of the ships, were the eyes by which
they saw how to direct themselves in their course. Gunnes seemed to them, for
their hideous noise, to be the works of the Devil: and for bag-pipes, they
took them to be living creatures; neither when they had been permitted to
f^ele them, would they be persuaded but that they were the work of Gods own
hands. The very Nobles, (if so noble a name may without offense be given to so
blockish a people) are so stupid, that when they are in presence of their king,
they never look him in the face, but sit flat on their buttocks, with their
elbowes on their knees, and their hands on their faces: and for their greater
gallantrie, they anoint their hair with the fat of fishes, which makes them
stink abominably.

The Country is abundantly stored with gold and silver, very fine and pure: so
that had not the Portugals affected the honor of discovering new worlds, as
much as wealth; they might have made as rich a factory here, as at the Indies.

It is so called, either because the people are of a black color, or from the
river Niger. This river from the fifteenth day of June, ouerfloweth all the
adjacent fields, the space of 40 days And in so many more recollecteth his
waters, into their proper Channels: the whole country being indebted to these
inundations, for its fertility, which otherwise could be but small; since the
dryness of the soil can afford no exhalations, whereby clouds may be
generated, and the earth refreshed with moisture. This river hides his
Channel under ground, the space of six miles. The second river of note is
Senega, upon whose Northern Bank, the people are cole black; but on the
south only tawnie.

The chief Provinces, or kingdoms (of which here are 25) are 1 GVALATA, where
there is no administration of laws. 2 GVINEA, where there is neither Town,
nor Castle, except it be that of Mina, built and fortified by the Portugalls
for their better trading here. The people hereof account the principal part of
beauty, to consist in a flat nose, and therefore they press them down in
their infancy. 3 TOMBVTVM, Where the king causes such as have any commerce
with the Jews to be slain; and where the people spend their whole lives in
dancing, and singing. The King of Tombutum, is the richest Prince in all this
part of Afric, keeps a royal palace; and has to his guard 3000 horsemen;
and of footmen an infinite number. He has some Scepters, which weigh 1300
pound weight a piece: and continually maintains a great number of learned
men. 4 MELLI, a Country of 300 miles in length, has the richest, ciuillest,
and most industrious inhabitants, of any among these Nigrites. 5 CANO, a
Country abounding in Limmons, and Pomgranates. 6 GIALOFI, the people whereof
are of that admirable nimblenesse, that they would leap upon a horse when he
galloped; stand upright when he ran fastest; turn themselves about and
suddenly sit down: and as often as they listed, dismount, and mount again
^n a trice. 7 BENIN, the people whereof do cut and raze their skin with
three lines drawn to their navel* esteeming it necessary to salvation. They
use all, both men and women to go naked till they are married; and then to be
^l^ath^ only from the wast to the knees: so that had our 5 Thomas Moore ^iued
^n these parts, he had in some measure had (...) he among other strange plots
in his Vtopian Commonwealth, tells us how there it is the custom, for some
reverend old sire, to bring in naked the young man; and some hoarie old matrone
to present naked the young woman, between whom a marriage is motion'd. For,
says he, in buying a horse, the chapman not only vieweth his naked carkcase,
but takes off also his trappings and s^ddle, lest under them some blame might
lie hidden: and why the^ in choosing of a wife, should we take one of who^ we
see no more then the face ( vniv pal^rae spatium) and perhaps scarce that. But
the conuenience of this libidinous plotte, I leave to your censure. 8 NVBIA,
which once wholly peopled by Christians, is now fallen to its former Idolatry,
for want of Ministers to instruct them: they sent once to the Emperor of
Aethiopia for teachers, but were by him unchristianly rejected. Here is a
poison, wher^of the tenth part of a grain, will dispatch a man in a quarter of
an houre^ and is sold for 100 Ducats the ounce. 9 BORNVM, where the people
have neither children, wives, nor names; but are distinguished by some
external accident. 10 GOAGA, where the king has no revenues, but what be
forcibly takes from his enemies. 11 GANAGA, where the king has no estate, but
what his Nobles please daily to allow him.


The chief Towns of these Provinces are 1 Tombutum. 2 Gen^i. 3 Agadez. 4
Guangara. 5 Songum. 6 Chouinum, the third City in estimation of all Afric.
This Country altogether unknown, or very little discovered in times of old;
was first, if not found, yet plainly manifested by the Mahumetan Priest^: who
out of a supersticious zeal to propagate their doctrine; made a passage to
these parts, Anno ^08, at which time here was neither king, nor commonwealth.
Joseph king of Morocco* first subdued them: afterward the Lybians became their
Lord whose last governor Soni Halin, was slain by Ischia, Anno 1526; and the
Negroes again recovered their long lost liberty insti^uting diverse king^, and
amongst others, Ischia was worthily mad^ K^^g ^f Tombu^um. After this
advancement, he quick^y united many of the weak kingdoms to his own* which at
this day is the greatest of the four, in whose hands kingly authority
remains. The other three are of 1 Bornum, which is somewhat less, 2 of
Gualata, whose kingdom is confined within the limits of that one Province. and
3 of Goaga, who possesses the remainder.

Thus much of Terra Nigritarum.

OF AETHIOPIA SVPERIOR.
PRius diuidenda antequam definienda sunt aequivoca, is as undoubted a truth in
nature, as a true rule in Logic: and therefore before I come to the
particulars of Aethiopia, I will clear my passage, in respect of some
ambiguity of the na^^^. For, whereas the Interpreters of the Bible in all
lang^ages, render the word Cush by Aethiopia, and the Cushites by Aethiopians:
they therein give occasion to many incongruities in sense, and reason. For
should we suppose the river Gihon, mentioned in the second of Genesis, to
compass about this Aethiopia; we should make Paradise to be of too large
extent. 2ly, Whereas it is said in the second of Chron: cap. 14. that Zerah
king of the Aethiopians, came against Asa, with an host of a million and 300
Chariots: this cannot properly be attributed to this Aethiopia, both, for that
it is likely that the king of Egypt, would never suffer so huge an army to
pass through his Country; and for that we find in the same chapter, how Asa,
to revenge this inrode, destroyed the Cities of Zerah, even unto Cera; which
is well known to stand in Arabia Petraea on the South border of Iudaea. 3ly,
Whereas it is said in the 29 of Ezechiel, that the land of Egypt should be laid
wast from the town of Siene, to the borders of Aethiopia: if it be meant of
this place it cannot be good sense; Siene being the very border town, betwixt
Egypt and Aethiopia; and is as if one should say, the English conquered all
France, between Callice and Dover. Aethiopia therefore mentioned in these and
sundry other places, must be conceived to be the land of Chus, or the Cusi^es,
which lay between Egypt and Assyria, the Red sea, and Persian gulf;
conta^ning Arabia Dese^ta, Petraea, and part of Felix. But not altogether to
dislike all translations, one distinction will salve all; which before I set
down I must tell you, (referring the first peopling of this Country till anon)
that the Graecians gave it the name of Aethiopia, from (...), vro, and (...)
vultus: because the violent heat of the sun schorched the faces of the
inhabitants:

Aethiopia is Africana Superior, of which now. Inferior, of which in the next
Chapt.
Asiatica, which extended from the red Sea unto the Persian gulf, and is that
Aethiopia which is so often mentioned in the old Testament.


Now that you may not suspect this distinction to be merely fained, and
gathered upon no grounds; see what I have transcribed out of Herodotus,
speaking of the expedition of Xerxes, against the Greeks. (...), etc. Arsames
(says he) was Captain of the Arabians, and the Aethiopians, that are beyond
Egypt. The more Eastern Aethiopians, were ranked with the Indians, nothing
differing from the other in the structure of their bodies, but in their hair
and voice only: the Eastern Aethiopians wearing their hair smooth; they of
Lybia, curled. The Aethiops of Asia were armed like the Indians, etc. but the
Aethiops of Afric (the very words of my distinction) were arrayed with the
skins of beasts, etc. So far Herodotus.

AETHIOPIA called SVPERIOR, because it is more north then the other: and also
Interior, because it is encompassed about with the other (unless where it is
bounded with Lybia, and the land of Negroes North) is called also Abasine,
either from Abas a prime river hereof, or from an Egyptian word signifying
scattered nations. It comprehe^deth the regions, once called Aethiopia sub
Aegypto, Trogloditica, and Cinnamomifera.

Of the Troglodites, ^omponius Mela gives us this character, Nullarum opum
domini sunt Trogloditae, strident magis quam loquuntur. As for their houses
they were (says he) no better the^ Caves, and their food no better then
Serpents. Pliny reports two strange things of this Country; 1 that the air
and ground are so parching hot, that the people not only dare not go out of
doors without shoes; but that they roast their meat also by setting it in the
Sun. 2ly That here is a lake, whose waters are thrice a day, and thrice a
night, exceeding salt and unpleasing, but at all other times most sweet and
delicious to the pallat. Josephus writes that Moses having slain the
Egyptian, fled into this Country, and here married the daughter of Iethro
Prince of it: but this is utterly false, for Moses fled into the land of
Madian, Ex. 2.15. which is on the other side of the red Sea, in Arabia Petraea.

This Country being as big as Germany, France, and Italy, laid together, is
but meanly populous, the d^stemperature of that climate, and the dry
barrenness of the ground, not admitting a multitude. For this cause Afric is
by Strabo compared to a Leopards skin, the distance of whose spots shows
the dispersednesse of Towns, and habitations in these torrid countries. This
region is scarce in wheat, but sufficiently plentiful in Rice, Barley, Beans,
Pease, and the like. They have abundance of Sugars, Minerals of all sorts, and
infinite herds of Oxen, sheep, Goats: Finally, there is no Country under heaven
fitter for increase of plants, and living creatures; if industry were not
deficient. The people are much inclined to barbarism, destitute of all
learning, not to be credited unless they swear by the life of their Emperor.
They hate a Smith equally with the Devil. Their color is generally olive
tawny, excepting only their king himself, who is always of a white
complexion, a wonderful prerogative, if true. This blacknes of their bodies,
is by the Poet attributed to the burning of the world, by Phaeton; Sanguine
tum, credunt, i^ corpora summa vocato,
Aethiopum populos nigrum ^raxisse colorem.
Their blood (it is thought) drawn to the outward part,
The Aethiopians grew so black and swart.
But the true cause of it and its speculation, I will defer till I come to
treat of America.

The Christian faith was first preached here by the Eunuch of Q. Candace, who
was baptized by Philip the Deacon; but not totally propagated over the whole
Empire, till the reign of Abraham, Anno 470: who in his life, entitled
himself Defender and propagator of the religion of Christ; and was after his
death, canonized for a Saint, The particularities of their opinions, wherewith
they have infected the true purity, I find thus registered. 1. They use to
circumcise both males and females. 2 They baptize the males 40, the females 80
days, after their circumcision. 3 After the receipt of the Sacrament they are
not to spit tell Sunne-set. 4 They profess but one nature, and one will in
Christ. 5 They accept only the three first general Counsels. 6 Their Priests
live by the labor of their hands, for they allow them nothing, and permit them
not to beg. 7 They rebaptize themselves every Epiphany day in lakes and
ponds; because that day they suppose Christ to have been baptized by John, in
Jordan.

The chief rivers of this Country are 1 Abas (formerly called Astabus)
springing from the lake of Barenna. 2 Toccas^i. once Astaborus. 3 Nilus, whose
spring unknown to ancient writers, is by some supposed to arise out of the
lake of Zemre: thence this famous river takes his course toward Egypt, and
diverse times meeting with lower valleys, falls down headlong with such a
force and fury; that the continuance of the noise deafeth all the neighboring
inhabitants. In this Country are many Sluices, Ditches, and by-channells, to
curb the otherwise uncontrollable power of the river, which else would ouerflow
all Egypt. In respect hereof the Sultans of Egypt, have a long time paid unto
the Emperor of the Abassines, a great tribute: which when the great Turk,
supposing it to be a needless custom, did deny; this people, by the command
of their Emperor, did break down their dammes, and open their sluices:
whereby drowning Egypt, they enforced the Turk not only to continue his
tribute, but to give them also great sums of money for the remaking of these
dammes and sluices. The fourth river of note is Zairo, which arising in the more
mountainous parts, ends his long pilgrimage in the lake Zemre. Here are also
some lakes reported to be of that poisonous nature, that whosoever drinks of
them, either falls immediately mad, or is for a long time trobled with a
drowsines. Of which Ovid. Aethiopesque lacus: quos si quis faucibus hausit,
Aut furit, aut patitur mirum grauitate soporem.
Who does not know the Ethiopian lake,
Whose waters he that drinks his thirst to slake;
Either grows mad, or does his soul oppress
With an unheard of heavy drowsinesse.


This Country howsoever most replenished with Christians of any in Afric; yet
has it on the East, many Mahumetans; on the West, many Heathens, mingled with
the Christians. These Christians show a book of eight volumes, written, as
they believe, by the Apostles, assembled for that end at Jerusalem; the
contents whereof they observe most solemnly.

The chief Cities are first Saba, built by Queen Maqueda, or rather by her
repaired, and beautified. It has 4 gates made of Alablaster and Iaspis stone,
wrought with antique works, and the doors thereof curiously carved. It has
5000 houses great and sumptuous, the streets spacious, and so shaded with
pent-houses, that men may walk safe from the violence of the Sun or rain.
From the name of this City, it is thought that the Queen of Saba, which came
to see Solomon, was Queen of this Country. 2 Aruma, built by king Aruc. 3
Cossomum. 4 Zameta the residence of Bernagassus. 5 Erocco, and Suachon, the
only havens of this Emp^re, being under the Turks. 6 The K. Court which is as
a wandering City: for which his Tents and Pauilions belonging to him, and his
retinue; hec covers no less then 10 miles. 7 Tanapo, of old the residence of
the Ethiopian Emperors, sacked and ruined by Petronius, President of Egypt.
For when Candace (the predecessor, I believe, of her, whose Eunuch was
baptized by Philip) had ransacked and wasted Egypt, with fire and sword:
Petronius, Lieftenant to Augustus, drove them home; harried the whole Country,
put this City to the spoil, and to prevent the like inrodes, fortefied the
frontiers of his Province. 8 Zembra, nigh unto the lake so called, where in the
year 1570, certain workmen purposely sent from Florence, by Duke Francis,
built a royal palace; which is sometimes honored with the presence of the
Emperor.

There are in this Empire 70 tributary kingdoms, the chief whereof are, 1
BERNAGASSVM, whose Pro-rex is known by the same name, lies toward the red Sea,
and bordreth on the Turk, who receaueth hence the yearly tribute of 1000
Crowns, 2 TIGREMAON, famous for her mines of Gold. 3 ANGOTE, where the people
use Salt, Pepper, and iron instead of money: and seed on raw flesh. This custom
of using Salt, Pepper, and the like, instead of money, was in former times among
most people, the only bartery or way of excha^ge. So in Homer, Glaucus golden
armor was valued at 100 kine; and Diomedes armor, at ten only. Afterward in
justice commutatiue, it was deemed convenient to have some common Judge, or
valuation of the equality or inequality of goods: the invention of which, the
Jews attribute to Cain: the Grecians, to Hermodice, the wife of Midas: the
Romans, to Ianus. It is called Nu^mus, or (...) from (...); because it was
ordained by law: Pecunia, either because in elder times, the chief of their
wealth consisted in Cattle (as now among the Irish) or from a Cow ( Pecus)
which was stamped on it: and Moneta a monendo, as Suidas says; because when
the Romans stood in need of money, Inno monebat, that they should use justice,
and there should be no want of money. To this Goddess, Dea pecunia, the Romans
erected a Temple, and worshipped it in the figure of a woman, holding a pair
of scales in one hand; and a coraucopia in the other. 4 AMARA, where there is a
hill of the same name, being in circuit 90 miles; and a days iourny high* on
the top whereof are 34 palaces, in which the younger sons of the Emperor
are continually enclosed, to avoid sedition; wherein they enjoy whatsoever is
fit for delight, or princely education; and out of which one of them, who is
most hopeful or best liked, is again brought out, if the Emperor die
sonne-lesse, to be made successor. This mountain has but one ascent up,
which is impregnably fortified, and was destinate to this use Anno 470, or
thereabouts; by the Emperonr Abraham Philip; advised hereunto, as he gave out,
by an heavenly vision. In one of these palaces is a famous Library, wherein
are many books, which with us are either in part, or totally lost: as the
Oracles of Enoch, with the mysteries which escaped the flood being by him
engraven on pillars; the whole works of Livie, and others. 5 GVAGERE, of old
called Meroe, an Island in the river Nilus, being 175 miles long, and 125 broad.
The chief city was Meroe, so named of Meroe, mother to Cambises; to continue
whose memory, her son built this City. 6 FATAGAR, 7 DANCALI. 8 GOYAMI, in
which is the lake Zembre. 9 BAGAMEDRAN. 10 XOA.


Chus was the first Prince of this Country, Regma the 2d, and Dodan the 3d.
From these kings till the time of Aruc, the people lived in Caves, and rockie
holes. He taught them to build houses; and to lead the way, built Aruma. The
fourth from Aruc, was Maqueda, called in holy writ the Q. of Saba, and of the
South. She went to Jerusalem to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see the order
of his house: and as their stories relate, returned home great with child by
Solomon. This child being borne was called by his mother, Melilech; but by
Solomon, David: since which, the Kings were called David's; till Indian the
Eunuch of Q Candace returning home, baptized his young Prince, calling him
Philip. Hitherto we have spoken out of their own Chronicles, but they we know
are no Gospel. That Chus planted in Arabia, we have already told you, as also
what absurdities arise, from supposing the land of Chus to be this Aethiopia:
most probable therefore it is, that this country was in process of time,
peopled by the progeny of Ludim and Phu^; who were seated on the Mediterranean
shore of Africa. Now whereas Stephanus has, in his opinion, decided the
controversy, making Sheba, the son of Chus, the father of the Arabians; and
Sheba, the son of Regma, the father of the Aethiopians, and for this cause
has found out a pretty criticisme that Sheba, when it was written with ^
Samech, must be rendered Aethiopia; and Arabia, when it is written with ^ Shin;
this co^cei^, is in my opinion (as the rest of that strain are) more nice then
wise; it being evident, that both Sheba the son of Chus, and Sheba the son of
Regma, peopled Arabia. As for Q. Maqueda, doubtless she was Queen of the
Sabaeans, not the Aethiopians. For, besides the longsomnesse of the journey,
too much for a woman and a Queen to travel; it is very probable when Shisacke
king of Egypt spoiled Jerusalem, in the reign of Rhehoboam; that the King of
Aethiopia, who, if this be true, was at that time the son of Maqueda; would
not have suffered Egypt to have laien quiet, whiles his brother Rhehoboams
Country was a wasting, if there had been any such tie between them. To leave
these fables then, the first story which we meet with concerning the
Aethiopians, Herodotus.
is in the time of Cambises, long after Solomon, who having united Egypt to
Persia, intended also to have united Aethiopia to Egypt. Upon this motion,
Ambassadors were sent to try the strength of the King, and search the
passages of the Country: carrying with them as presents, a purple habit, some
brace^ets, a box of sweet ointments, and a tun of wine. The Ethiopian
receiving these tokens, accounted the unguent and purple, slight and
effeminate; the bracelets he openly laughed at, as being too weak to hold in a
prisoner (for he took them to be bonds:) only the wine he was delighted with,
and sorrowed that this country yielded no such liquor. At the dismission of
these Ambassadors, they were amongst other gifts, presented with a bow of
wondrous strength; the Ethiopian bidding the^ tell their master, that until
every Persian could bend that bow, it would be no safe meddling with his people:
adding withal, that Cambises might thank the Gods, for giving the Aethiopians
so contented minds, that they thought not on conquering their neighbors
kingdoms. To return again to our Ethiopian story, which now begins to be
more credible. After the baptizing of the first Philip by the Eunuch, all the
succeeding Emperors were called Philip; till the religious reign of John,
honored with the title of Saint: since whose death till this present time,
they are called John's, with the praenomen, as some will of Presbyter; affirming
that he executes as well the ministerial as the kingly office, Idem hominum
Rex, divumque Sacerdos: But as others, and that more probably, of Pretiosus;
for the word Prete-gian, by which name his subjects use to call him, imports
no less. They never had disastrous success in any affairs, till the year
1558, in which the Turks seized on Barnagassum: and since, Anno 1603, when the
last Emperor was slain by the King of Adel. The person of this Emperor is
much honored, nay adored by his subjects, to whom he shows himself but
thrice in a year, viz: on Christmas, Easter, and Holyrood day: by which
retiredness he makes his presence more acceptable, as holding nothing to be
more derogatory from the Majesty of a King, then to make himself too common an
object, for the eye of the vulgar. The like kind of state, was once kept by
those kings of France, who withdrawing themselves from all public affairs,
used only to show themselves (as we have already said) on May Day. A greater
retiredness then this, is that of which Velleda, Queen of the Tencteri, a
people of the Rhene, is reported by Tacitu^ to have used. For when the rest of
the Germans then in arms, sent Ambassadors to her, to inform her of her
victory against the Romans; they were prohibited either to speak to her, or
see her; Arcebantur aspectu, quo venerationis plus inesset. Such a keeping of
state, the politic Prince Tiberius used, when the German legions mutined; for
he daigned not to go himself to see them pacified, but the reason was, quia
maiestati mayor e longinquo reuerentia. And no doubt the same keeping of
distance, swaied much with him when he forsook Rome, and kept Court privately
at Caprea; though I deny not, but a propension to follow his unnatural
pleasures, the more securely, together with the deformities on his face, had
also their powers upon his resolution.

The title of this great and mighty Emperor, runs thus. N.N. supreme of
his kingdoms, and the beloved of God, the pillar of faith, sprung from the
stock of Judah, the son of David, the son of Solomon, the son of the
column of Sion, the son of the seed of Jacob, the son of the hand of Mary,
the son of Nahu after the flesh, the son of St Peter and Paul after the
spirit; Emperor of the higher and lesser Aethiopia, and of ^he most mighty
kingdoms, dominions, and Countries of Goa, Caffares, Fatigar, Angola, Barn,
Balignazo, Adea, Vangne, Goyami where are the fountains of Nile, Amara,
Banguamedron, Ambea, Vangucum, Tigremaon, Sabaim, the birth^place of the Queen
of Saba, Bernagassum; and Lord of all the Regions unto the consines of Egypt.
It seems by this title, that these Ethiopian Emperors, howeuer the truth of
story goes conceive themselves to be sprung from Solomon, and Maqueda (or
Nizaule as Joseph names her) the Queen of the South. For better confirmation
whereof, it is by some reported, that the Arms of this kingdom, are the same
with those of the Tribe of Judah, which are a Lion rampant in a field Or; and
that the motto of them is to this effect, viz; The Lion of the Tribe of Judah
shall overcome. But Bara an expert Herald, gives this Prince no such
coat armor: his Arms according to him being Luna, a cross portate Mars,
charged with a crucifixe Sol; between two scourges of the second.

His revenues cannot but be great, Boterus.
considering that his expenses both of Court, and Army discharged; he always
coffers up 3 millions in a year; Insomuch that he offered the Portugals, if
they would war against the Infidels, one million of Gold; and another of men:
which later was more (sure) then he could perform, seeing he could never levy
half the number in his own greatest extremities.

Thus much of Aethiopia Sup^rior.

OF AETHIOPIA INFERIOR.
AETHIOPIA INFERIOR, called also Exterior, has on the East, the Red Sea; on
the West, the Ethiopian Ocean; on the North, Terra Nigritarum, and Aethiopia
Interior; and on the South, the Southern Ocean. It was said of this Country,
that it was mountainous toward the West, sandy in the midst, and desert
toward the East.

The usual division of this Region is into 5 parts, 1 Aian, 2 Zangibar, 3
Monometapa, 4 Cafaria, 5 Monicongo.

AIAN lies between the mouth of the Red Sea, and the River Calimanci: it
comprehends the two potent kingdoms of Ab^x, and Adel. The king of this
later by name Guad^ameth, or Grand Amida, had a great hand over the deceased
Emperor of the Habassines: this Country abounds with Flesh, Honey, Wax,
Corn, Gold, Ivory, and great store of Sheep, whose tails are 25 pound
weight, The prime Cities are, 1 Arar, 2 Zeil^, 3 Borbora, all situate without
the streights of the Red Sea, and much frequented by merchants. Zeila was the
chief of them, built nigh unto the Bay which Ptolomie called Sin^s Avaliticus,
from the Avalites, or Abalites, who are said to have dwelt hereabout. It had in
it some buildings that seemed to be very ancient: and was sacked and burned by
the Portugals, Ao 1516.

The kingdom of Abex, or Adea, is situate between Adel, and Habassia, to
which last it is tributary. The chief Towns are 1 Brava, 2 Pate, and 3 Gogia:
these two last belonging to the Portugals, who took them under the conduct of
Tristran de Cugna.

ZANZIBAR extends from the river Quilimanci, to M^^^motapa. The people as
well of this Province, as of Aian, are on the shore side descended of the
Arabians, Purchase.
whose superstition they embrace. The more inland people are the true natives,
and still adhere to their Gentilisme.

The chief Towns are 15, and give name to as many kingdoms. The first Corova,
2 Calen, 3 Anzuga, 4 Monculo, 5 Badin, 6 Melinda, 7 Momboza, 8 Quilao, whose
King named Abraham, gave the Portugals leave to build fortresses in his
Country, Anno 500: but they fondly presuming on their own strength, deposed
this Abraham, Anno 1509; for which fact, the Arabians demolished their Forts,
and sent them to learn better moderation in their prosperous estates. The
people of this Quiloa, have among them a strange custom, which I will mention
rather for the rarity, then decency. They use when they have any female
children borne unto them, to sow up the private passages of nature, leaving
only a small passage for the urine. Thus sowed, they keep them carefully at
home, ill they come to a marriageable age; then they give the^ to their
neighbors for wives. And she (of what rank or condition soever she be) that
is by her husband found to want this sign of her perpetual virginity: is with
all kind of ignominy and disgrace sent home unto her parents; and by them as
opprobriously received.

The 9 Province is Mosambique, 10 M^mbara. 11 Monbizo. 12 Macaos. 13 Embroe. 14
Mordomugi. 15 Safila, which for its abundance of Gold and Ivory, is by some
thought to be that land of Ophir, to which Solomon sent; and of this opinion Mr
Purchase seems to be. But this is not very probable; for first, Ophir the
son of Ioctan, of whom mention is made in the 10 of Genesis verse 29: and from
whom the land of Ophir, in all likelihood took its name; is in the next verse,
said to have planted in the East; whereas this Safila is situate South-west
from Chaldea, in which the confusion of tongues, and dispersing of the people,
began. 2ly, It is impossible for the navy of Solomon, which lay at Ezion
Geber, to have spent 3 years in coming hither, and returning: which we find
to have bin the usual times of finishing the voyage to Ophir, 1 Kings. chap.
10. Ophir then is some part of India; but whether it were the Island of Sumatra,
or one of the Molucco's, or the land of Malavar, called by the ancients, Aurea
Chersonesus, I dare not determine: considering what worthy men maintain these
several opinions.

The principal rivers are 1 Coava, 2 Quama, 3 Magnice.

MONOMOTAPA, Bonomotapa, or Bonemotaxa, is environed almost round with waters;
having on the West and South the river called Rio d' Infanto; on the East, the
Ocean; and on the North, the river Quama. This Country is in compass 450
miles, and abounds with such store of Elephants, that no less then 5000 are
yearly killed, for their teeths sake. Here are said to be 3000 mines of Gold,
the chief being Manica, Boro, and Quitiavi.

The chief Provinces are 1 Motana, 2 Tocoa, 3 Melcucba. 4 Quinibebe, 5
Berfaca, 6 Bavagal. The chief Cities are Monomotapa, Zimbas, and Tongum the
Kings seat, where Anno 1560, one of them was christened by Gonsaluo a Jesuit,
whom not long after by the persuasion of some Arabians, he caused to be slain.

The people hereof are Heathen for the most part, yet they worship not idols,
but believe in one god, who^ they call Mozimo, and in some places are very
prone to receive the Faith of CHRIST. They punish nothing more severely then
witchcraft, theft, and adultery. In the punishment of Delinquents, they use no
prisons, but execute them as soon as they are apprehended; which is the cause
that the vulgar sort have no doors to their houses, this being an honorable
privilege belonging to Lords only. The King of this Country is always called
by the name of Monomotapa: he is served on the knee; and when he drinks, or
cougheth, all that are about him, make such a shout, that all the Tower rings
of it. All that come into his presence, must sitdown, for to stand is a sign
of dignity, and the chief honor that can be afforded unto any. He is said to
have for his guard 200 mastiues. The women are here much respected. The
Monomotapa himself if he meet them in the street, giving them the way. They
are not to be married, till their menstrua, or natural purgation, testify
their ability for conception; and therefore they solemnize the first flux
thereof, with a great feast.

CAFRARIA has on the East Rio d' Infanto, on the West and South, the Ocean;
and on the North, Lunae montes. It takes its name from Cafars, which in the
Arabicke signifies Heretics: which though common to all Heathens, is yet
appropriated to this Region, as destitute of another name. This Country
extends toward the South with a long Promontory, called Caput bonae spei, or
C^p de bunna speranza: which was discovered, together with these Southern
parts of A^rick, by Vasco di Games, Anno 1497. The top of this Cape is a fair
and pleasing plain, adorned with great variety of flowers, and covered with a
carpet of grass; it is called the table of the Cape, and yields a large
prospect over the Sea on all sides. The Sea here is very rough and tempestuous,
and has to the Spaniards proved oftentimes very unkind: whereupon a Spanish
Captain being sorely vexed with a storm, expostulated with GOD, why he suffered
so good Catholics to endure such torments; and permitted the English
Heretics and blasphemers to pass so easily. The people live like beasts, are
black as pitch, and therefore use when they would represent any ugly thing, to
make it white: they have flat noses, and thick lips. They have some villages
in which they live together; and in every village a king or lord to whom they
are subject.

MANICONGO has on the East, Habassia; on the West, the Aethiopique Ocean; on
the North, the land of Negroes; on the South, the hills called Lunae montes.
These Countries were discovered by Dego Can, a Portugal, Anno 1486. They are
very populous, insomuch that they sell unto the Portugals yearly, 28000
slaves, as it is supposed; who are all carried to Brasil, there to work in the
mines. The principal Towns are 1 Benza, called by the Portugals, since they
initiated this Nation in the Faith of Christ, S. Saviors, or S. Salvedore, 2
S. Paul lying on the Sea shore, a Town built and fortified by the Portugalls,
for the better assurance of their trade: and 3 Loanda, seated just opposite to
S. Paul, in an Island of the same name; caused (as it is thought) by the mud and
dirt, which the river Coanzo brought thither. It is the principal hauen-towne
of these parts.

This Country is watered by the rivers Bengo. 2 Coanzo. 3 Dande. 4 Loz^. 5
Ambres. 6 Zai. The people hereof were by the Portugals instructed in the Faith
of Christ: which again they renounced, as being not able to conform their
lives unto it.

The Provinces appear in this swelling and voluminous title of the present
King, Alvara king of Congo, Sango, Bambu, Sandi, Bango, Batta, Pempa, Abundi,
Matama, Quizama, Angol^, Cacongo: Lord of the Congeries, Amolaze, Langelungi,
Anziqui, Cucchi, and Laangi. Most of the latter named nations are
Anthropophagi, and have shambles of man's flesh, as usually as we of ordinary
meats. The people do always kill their children so soon as they be borne,
lest they should be a hinderance to them in their vagabond wanderings, and
transmigrations. But to conserve the nation, they use to buy or steal young
striplings, from the neighboring Countries. Amongst the more civil Provinces,
Angola is of most esteem, which not long since revolted from their subjection
and allegiance to the King of Congo: and is certainly a most populous Province.
For in the battle betwixt the King of this Country, and Paulus Diazius a famous
Leader of the Portugals, the King had in his Army, 1200000 soldiers; yet a few
of his enemi^s, wisely and p^li^iquely governed, gave him a dismal, and fatal
overthrow, 1582.

Thus much of Aethiopia Inferior.

OF EGYPT.
Maginus.
EGYPT is bounded on the East with the Red Sea; on the West, with Cyrene; on the
North, with the Mediterranean; on the South, with Habassia. In the place where
this Egypt and Habassia meet, is the last cataract of Nolus; which is a fall
of the waters, after much struggling with the rocks for passage, an incredible
way down into the lower valleys. The hideousnes of the noise which it makes,
not only deaueth all the bydwellers, but the hills also are torn with the
sound: For as Lucan: Cuncta tremunt undis, and multo murmr montis
Spume^s invictis albescit fluctibus amnis.
The noise the mountains shakes, who roar in spite
Sands.
To see th'vnvanquish'd waves clothed all in white.
Yet you may diverse times see the Country people, in a little boat, able to
contain but two only, venture down these falls; aed appearing after they are
long lossed in the waters, a great distance off, as if they had been shot out
of an engine.

This Country was first inhabited by Misraim, the son of Chus, the son of
Cham, and was called in the Hebrew tongue Misreia: the footsteps of which name
remains amongst the Arabians, who call it Misre. 2 It was named Oceana, from
Oceanus a King hereof. 3 O^iriana, from Osiris. 4 Aegyptus, from Egypt; being
the surname of Rameses, a Prince of great power.

The Country is in length from Siene, to the Mediterranean Sea, 562 miles; and
in breadth, from Rosetta West, to Damiata East; about 140 miles. But it
continues not always in this breadth for lessening it self Southwards, like a
Pyramid reversed, it is in some places but 37 miles broad, and at the very
point or bottom, but four. It is situate between the second and the fifth
Climates, so that the longest day is 13 hours, and a half.

The inhabitants, though this Country lie in the same Climate with Barbary,
are not black, but tawnie and brown. They were the inventers of the
Mathematical Sciences, and are still endued with a special dexterity of wit;
but are somewhat slothful, and given to riot and luxury; merry also and
sociable companions. The old Egyptians are by Pomponius charactred, to have
used to weep and mourn over their dead bodies, dawbed over with dung; to have
held it almost a piacle to burn or bury them, but having embalmed them, to
have laid them in some inward room of their houses. The men (says he) keep
home, and spinne; the women manage the greater businesses: the men carry
burdens on their heads, the women on their backs. Not much unlike to which last
custom, they have still one of a new stamp; for here the women piss
standing, and the men couring on their knees. They worshipped in every Town and
its Territory, particular gods; but the god by them most adored, was Apis; an
Ox, black all over his body, having a white star in his forehead, the
effigies of an Eagle on his back, and two hairs only in his tail. It seems
his deity was not much respected by strangers; for Cambises when he conquered
Egypt, ran him with his sword through the thigh, causing all his Priests to be
scourged: and Augustus being here, Dion.
would not vouchsafe to see him, saying; (...), dios se colere consuevisse, non
boues, a speech worthy so brave a Prince.

For its abundant fruitfulness this country was called Horreum populi Romani;
and in the time of Joseph, supplied Jacob and his Family with corn. Now also
is the goodness of the soil such, as is contained in these two verses of
Lucans. Terra suis contenta bonis, non indigna mercis,
Aut Ievis; in solo tantatest fiducia Nilo.
The Earth content with its own wealth, does crave
No foreign Marts, nor Jove himself; they have
Their hopes alone in Nilus fruitful wave.
This Nilus has his head either in the mountains of the Moon, or the lake
Zembre in Aethiopia interior: and running in one continual Channel, till it
washes the midland of Egypt, is before its influx into the Sea, divided into 7
other Channels, or mouths; namely 1 Heracleoticum, 2 Bolviticum, 3
Schaniticum, 4 Patinicum, 5 Mendesium, 6 Caniticum, 7 Pelusiacum. The first and
last of these currents being sarre distant at the Sea; and growing into one, at
the first point of the rivers division; make the part which is called Delta.
because it ve^embleth the Greek letter D. The other part is called Thebais,
from Thebes, the chief Town of it. This Nil^s, from the 15 day of June,
swells above his banks the space of 40 days; and in as many more gathers
his waters again to their proper bounds. If it flow not to the height of 15
Cubits, then the Earth is deficient in her abundance of increase, for want of
moisture: and if the waters surmount the superficies of the Earth, more then 17
cubits; then like a drunken man it cannot produce its natural operations, as
having its stomach (as it were) ouer-laid, and surcharged with too much liquor:
but if the mean be granted, there is no Country can brag of such abundance,
the corn being all inned before the end of May. During this inundation, the
beasts and cattle live on the hills, and in the Towns, to which they are
beforehand driven; and there are, til the decrease of the waters, foddered. As
for the Towns and villages, they stand all on the tops of the hills, and at
the time of the flood, appear like so many Islands. Commerce and intercourse is
not a ^ot diminished; for skiffes and the like boats, supply the places of
horses and camels, transporting safely and speedily, the marketmen and their
commodities, from one Town to another. When the river does not thus ouer-flow
the Country, it is not only the usher to a following dearth; but
prognosticateth some ensuing mischief to the State and Princes thereof. And it
is by Authors of good credit related, that in the 10th and 11th year of
Cleopatra, the river increased not: which was observed to be a fore-teller of
the fall of two great Potentates, this Cleopatra, and her sweetheart Antonie.
A second commodity arising from this inundation of the Nile, is the health it
brings with it; for the plague, which here often miserably ^ageth, upon the
first day of the flood does insta^tly cease: insomuch that whereas 500 dye in
Caire, the day before; the day following there dies not one. A third
strangeness in this river is, that keeping its waters together, it changes
the color of the Sea farther into the Mediterranean, then the sea can thence
be discerned. A fourth miracle is, that not in fruits only, but in producing
live creatures also, it is even to wonder fruitful: as Ovid, Namque ubi
deseruit madidos septemfluus agros
Nilus, and antiquo sua flumina reddidit alveo;
Plurima cultores versis animalia glebis
Inveniunt --
For when the seauen-mouth'd Nile the fields forsakes,
And to his ancient Channel him betakes;
The tillers of the ground live creatures find
Of sundry shapes, in the mud that is left behind.
This river is in length almost 3000 miles, and being the only river of Egypt,
affords the only drink to the Egyptians, and is of such virtue, that when
Pesceninus Niger saw his Soldiers grumble for wine; what (says he) do you
murmr for wine, having the waters of Nilus to drink? On the banks of this
river, down toward Alexandria, stood that famous Labyrinth, built by
Psamniticus. It contained within the compass of one continued wall, 1000
houses, and 12 royal palaces, built and covered with marble. It had only one
entrance, but innumerable ways within, turning and returning, one sometimes
over the other, and all in a manner invious to men not acquainted. So Mela
describes it. The building was more under the Earth, then above, the marble
stones being laid with that art, that neither wood, nor cement, was employed in
any part of the fabric. The chambers were so disposed, that the doors upon
their opening, did give reports no less terrible then thunder: and the maine
entrance all of white marble, adorned with stately columns, and most curious
works of imagerie. On the banks of this river also, grew those sedgie weeds
called Papyri, of which Paper was in former times made. They divided it into
thin flakes, whereinto it naturally parts: then laying them on a table, and
moistning them with the glutinous water of the river; they pressed them
together, and so dried them in the Sun. By means of this Invention, books
being easier to be transcribed and reserved; Ptolomaeus Philadelphus made his
excellent Library at Alexandria; and understanding how Attalus king of
Pergamum, by the benefit of this Egyptian paper, striued to exceed him in that
kind of magnificence, prohibited the carrying of it out of Egypt. Hereupon
Attalus invented parchment, called from the place of its invention, Pergamena;
from the materials thereof, being sheep skins, Membrana: the conveniencie
whereof was the cause, why in short time the Egyptian paper was worn out; in
place whereof succeeded our paper made of rags: the Author of which
invention, our progenitors have not committed to memory. Before the use of
these papers and parchment was known, I observe 3 kinds of writing: 1 on the
inward side of the bark of a tree, which is in Latin called Liber, and whence
we call our books Libri. 2ly on tables framed out of the maine body of a tree,
which being called Caudex, gave the Latins occasion to call a book Codex, 3ly
they used to cover their Tables over with wax, and thereon to write what they
listed, from whence tabellarius now signifies a letter carrier. The instrument
with which they wrote, was a sharpe-pointed iron, which they called Stylus, a
word now signifying (the original hence taken) the peculiar kind of phrase,
which any man uses; as negligens stylus in Quintilian; and exercitatus stylus
in Cicero. I should have told you how they used also to write in leaves, and
how the Sybils Oracles being thereon written, and scattered abroad, were called
Sybillae folia; and from whence perhaps, we still use to say, a leaf of paper:
but of this enough.

The people of this Country were instructed in the Gospel by Saint Mark,
which they generally retained till the coming of the Saracens: at what time
most of them embraced Mahumetanisme. The remainder of the Christians, being in
a country so populous not above 50000, are called Copties; and that either from
(...), scindo, because they use Circumcision: or from Coptas, a town where the
most of them reside: or from Aegophti, a name corrupted from Aegypti. They are
in a manner all Iacobites, from whom notwithstanding, as from all other
Churches, they differ in some things, viz: 1 They confer all sacred orders,
under the Priesthood, upon Infants immediately after Baptism; their parents
till they come to 16 years of age, performing their office for them: secondly
they allow marriage in the second degree of consanguinity, without any
dispensation: thirdly, they observe not the Lords day, nor any other festiuals,
but only in the cities; and fourthly they embrace and ^ead in their Liturgies,
a Gospel, written (as they say) by Nicodemus.

In the time of Heathenisme, the Priests were held in equal honor with their
kings; who expressed their conceits, both belonging to Religion and worldly
affairs, by the shapes of beasts, birds, trees, etc. which they called
Hieroglyphickes, of which two or three examples out of Orus will not be
impertinent. For aeternity, they painted the Sun and the Moon, as things
which they believed had no beginning, nor would have any end. For a year, they
painted a snake, with his tail in his mouth; to show how one year succeeding
another, kept the world still in an endless circle. For a month, they painted
a palm tree; because at every new Moon it sends forth a new branch. For God,
they painted a Falcon; as well for that he soareth so high, as that he
governs the lesser birds for integrity of life, they painted fire and water,
both because these Elements are in themselves most pure, and because all other
things are purified by them. For any thing that was abominable to the gods,
they painted a fish; because in their sacrifices, the Priests never used them;
and the like. From this manner of expressing ones self, the invention of
letters is thought to have had its original; the history whereof, take
briefly, and word for word, out of Tacitus: Primi per formas animalium Aegypti,
etc. The Egyptians first of all expressed the conceptions of the mind, by the
shapes of beasts; and the most ancient monuments of man's memory, are seen
graven in stones, and they say, that they are the first inventers of letters.
Then the Phoenicians, because they were strong at sea, brought them into
Greece, and so they had the glory of that, which they received from others. For
there goes a report, that Cadmus sailing thither in a Phoenician ship, was the
inventer of the art among the Greeks, when they were yet inexpert and rude.
Some record that Cecrops the Athenian, or Livius the Theban, and Palamedes the
Grecian, did find out 16 Characters, at the time of the Trojan war; and that
afterward Simonides added the rest. But in Italy the Etrurians learned them of
Demaratus the Corinthian; and the Aberigines of Evand^r the Arcadian. So far
Tacitus. That the Phoenici^ns were the first inventers of Letters, I dare not
affirm; and as backward am I to refer the glory hereof to the Egyptians; for
certainly the Jews were herein skilled before either: yet that the Phoenicians
were herein Schoolmasters to the Greeks, I think I may with safety affirm,
having Lucan in consent with Tacitus. Phoenices primi (famae si creditur) ausi
Mansuram ^udi^us vocem signare figuris,
Phoenicians first (if fame may credit have)
Dared in rude Characters our words t'engraue.
As for these less vulgar Letters, which the Latins call Cip^rae, and whereof
every exercised statesman has peculiar to himself; they were first invented
by Julius Caesar, when he first began to think of the Roman Monarchy; and
were by him in his letters to his more private and tried friends, used: that if
by misfortune they should be intercepted, the Contents of them should not be
understood: (...), ne obvia literarum lectio c^ivis esset. Augustus one of the
greatest politickes of the world, had an other kind of obscure writing; for in
his letters of more secrecy and importance, he always used (...), to put the
letter immediately following in the order of the Alphabet, for that which in
ordinary writing he should have used. As for Brachygraphie, or the Art of
writing by short Characters, so useful for the taking of a speech or sermon as
it is spoken; I cannot say either who was the Author, or whether the Invention
be ancient, or more modern; only I find in Dion, that Maecoenas that great
favorite of Augustus Caesar, and favorer of Learning, did first find out
certain notes and figures, ad cel^ritatem scribendi, for the speedier dispatch
of writing: (...), (they are the very words of my Author) (...). But I now make
haste to take a survey of the cities.

Pomponius Mela says, that there were in this Country, the number of 2000
Cities: and Herodotus affirms, that here were 1020: Which lesser reckoning
can not now be verified. The chiese of the present are 1 Alexandria, built by
Alexander the Great, now called Scanderia, a Town of great Merchandise; and
which in the Nicene Council, was ordained to be one of the four Patriarchall
Cities: the other three being Antioch, Rome, and Constantinople. The
inhabitants of this Town, as they abound in all wealth and pleasure, so in all
licentiousnes of life and speech; not sparing their Governor, nor the Roman
Emperors, Lords Paramount of their Country. Caracalla, son to Seuerus, even
when he came to honor their City with his presence, escaped not scot-free. But
he of a hasty nature, and impatient of all personal and verbal abuse; calling
an assembly of all the youths of the City, as if out of them he would choose
some to attend on his person; suddenly commanded his soldiers to put them all
to the sword. The slaughter was so great, and the waters of Nilus so
discolored with blood, that now the river might not improperly bin called the
Red Sea. In this Town, Anno 180, Gautenus read Divinity and Philosophy; from
whom it is thought, that the orders of instituting Universities first began in
Christendom. 2 Pelusium, now called Damiata, besieged often by Christian
Armies. The most famous of these sieges, was that of John di Brenne, the
titu'ary King of Jerusalem, and the confederate Princes of Europe, Anno 1220,
This siege continued 18 months, during which time, the plague and want of
sustenance so raged together, that the Town was in a manner dispeopled. Of
these extremities the besiegers knew nothing, till it fortuned that two
ventrous soldiers, admiring the silence and solitude of the people, in a
bravada scaled the walls, but saw no man to make resistance. This being
certified to the Captains, the next day the whole Army entered the Town, where
they found in every house, and every corner of the streets, whole heaps of
dead bodies, some slain by famine; others by the pestilence: a lamentable and
ruthful spectacle. 3 Bubastis, where Diana was worshipped. 4 Heliopolis, (now
called Betsamis)* whereof Potipharah, whose daughter Asineta, was by Pharaoh
given in marriage to Joseph, was Prince. These four Ci^ies are in the 30 of
Ezechiel, called No, Phisebeth, Shin, and Aven. 5 Siene, now Asna. 6 Thebes
built by the Tyrant Busiris, conta^ng 17 miles in circuit, and opening 100
Gates 7 Nicopolis, now Munia. 8 Canopus, where Osiris had his chief Temple, 1
Arsi^^e, or the City of Crocodiles, to which beasts the Citizens attributed
divine honor. It is now called Sues, and is a Haven Town standing at the very
No^th end of the Red Sea: in the time of the Ptolomies a Town of great
commerce, now almost abandoned, yet is it still a station of some of the Turks
galleyes, which being built at Caire, are taken again in pieces, and brought
hither on the backs of Camels. 10 Niloscopium, now called Elinichius. 11
Matared or Matarea, where the ground is so sertile, that the people are ^ain to
cover it with sand, to moderate the strength of it. 12 Coptus, 13 Memphis, nigh
unto which were the Pyramides. 14 Rosetta. 15 Cairo, built nigh to the place
where Memphis, or Babylon Aegyptiorum, was situated. It is in compass but 8
miles, within which space are 18000 streets; whereof every one has two Gates:
which being locked, make every street an impregnable Castle; which Selimus the
first found to be true, when he spent 3 days in passing through it with his
victorious Army* This City is so popul^us, that it is reputed in good health,
if there dye but 1000 in a day, or 300000 in the whole year; I mean when the
plague, Bot. of Cities
which every seventh year uses to visit them, is rife amongst them. 15 Gleba
rubra, which was burned by Phero, called also Amenophis, the fourth Lat^hu^; on
this occasion. This Phero being blind, was told, that is he washed his eyes
with the urine of a woman, Herodotus.
which being a wife, had known but one man, he should recover his sight. After
many vain trials, be found one woman, whose urine helped him; her he married:
and causing all the others whom he had tried, to be gathered together in this
Town; he si^ed the Town and all the women assembled in it.

Famous is this Country, 1 for that rain is seldom seen amongst them, whose
absence is supplied by Nile; and if a cloud happen to dissolve on them, it
brings on their bodies innumerable sores, and diseases. 2ly for the
Pyramides, built nigh unto Memphis, whereof two are most famous. The first and
greatest was built by Che^ps, who in this work employed 100000 men, the space
of 20 years. The charges of Garlic, Roots, and Onions only, came to 1600
Talents of silver. The basis of this Pyramid contained in circuit 60 Acres of
ground; and was in height 1000 ^oot, being made all of marble. Now when Cheops
wanted money, he prostituted his daughter to all comers, by which dishonest
means, he finished his building: and she besides the money due unto her Sire
(for I cannot call him father) desired for her self of every man that had the
use of her body, one stone: of whom she got so many, that with them she made
the 2d Pyramid, almost equal to the first, as Herodotus writes.

It is supposed by many good Divines, and recorded by Josephus, that the bricks
which the children of Israel did burn, were partly employed about such
Pyramides. But now Barbara Pyramidum sileat miracula Memphis.
Let barbarous Memphis cease to raise
Her wond^ous Pyramids with such praise.
On the East side of Egypt is the Red Sea, so called of the color of the
sands: as also Sinus Arabicus. It is in length 1600 miles. It is ^amous for the
miraculous passage of the Israelits through it, and the drowning of Pharaoh
Cenchres, and his people; as also for that through it the spices of India and
Arabia were brought to Alexandria; and thence by the Venetians dispersed
through all Europe, Africa, and Asia. I suppose I shall not do amiss to set
down Historically, a relation of the beginning, continuance, and period of the
traffic through this Sea. Ptol. Philadelphus, 277 years before the
Incarnation, was the first that set a foot this navigation; Galvano.
Cosir (of old called Myos-Horm^s) on the Sea side, was the ordinary Haven, out
of which they hoysed ^aile for India; and into which they returned full fraught
with their commodities. From hence they were by land conveyed to Coptus, and
so down the Nile to Alexandria: by which traffic, the City grew exceeding
rich; insomuch, that the custom house there yielded Ptol. Auletes, 7 millions
and a half of gold, yearly. The Romans being Lords of Egypt, enhanced the
customs to double that sum. They sent into India every year (as Pliny
witnesses) 120 ships, whose lading was worth 1200000 Crowns; and there was
made in return of every Crown, an hundred. When the Vandals, Lombards,
Goths, and Moors, had torn in pieces the Roman Empire, all commerce between
Nations began to cease; at last perceiving the inconvenience, they began anew;
conveighing the Indian commodities, partly by land, partly by water, unto
Capha, in Taurica Chersonesus, belonging to the Genoys. Next, Trabezond was
made the Mart-Towne; then Sarmachand in Zagetace; where the Indian, Turkish,
and Persian merchants, met to barter wares: the Turks conveighing their
merchandise to Damascus, Barutti, and Aleppo; from whence the Venetians
transported it to Venice, making that the common Emporium of Christendom. Once
again, viz: Anno 1300, the Soldans of Egypt restored the passage by the Red
Sea: which having continued more then 200 years, is discontinued by the
Portugals, Spaniards, English, and Dutch, which bring them to their several
homes by the back side of Afric; so that not only the traffic of Alexandria
is almost decayed; the riches of the Venetians much diminished; but the drugs
and spices have lost much of their virtue, as impaired by too much moisture.

This sea is also called Mare Erythraeum, on whose banks dwelt that Sybill
which was called Erythraea. These Sybillae seem to have taken denomination from
(...), 1. Iovis consiliorum consciae. They were in number ten, viz: 1 Persica:
2 Lybica. 3 Delphica. 4 Cumaea. 5 Samia. 6 Hellespontiaca. 7 Tiburtina. 8
Albunea. 9 this Erythraea. 10 Cumana, which last is affirmed to have written
the 9 books of the Sybils. They were al presented by an old Woman to Tarquinius
Superbus; but he not willing to pay so great a sum of money as was demanded,
denied them: whereupon the old woman burnt three of them, requiring as much
money for the other six, as for all; which being denied, she also burned the
other three, asking as much for the three remaining, as for the rest: which
Superbus, amazed, gave, and the old trot vanished. These books contained
manifest prophesies of the kingdom of Christ, his name, his birth, and death;
these were burned by the arch-traitour Stilico: So that those prophesies which
are now extant, are only such as are extracted out of others writings, wherein
mention of them was made.

All along the shores of this Sea, as also in the most desert places of the
country, are abundance of palms; trees of very strange properties. They grow
in couples male and female, both thrust forth cods full of seed; but the female
is only fruitful, and that not except growing by the male, and having his
seeds mixed with hers. The pith of these trees, is an excellent sallad, better
then an hartichoke, which in taste it much resembles. Of the branches they make
bedsteeds, lattices, etc. Of the leaves, baskets, mats, fannes, etc. Of the
outward husk of the Codde, cordage; of the inward brushes. The fruit it
bears is like a fig, and finally it is said to yield whatsoever is
necessary to the life of man. It is the nature of this tree, though never so
huge or ponderous a weight were put upon it, never to yield to the burden; but
still on resist the heaviness thereof, and to endeavor to lift and raise it
self the more upward: for which cause it was given to conquerours in token of
victory, it being the emblem or hierogliphicke of a soldiers life, and
perseverance. Hence figuratively it is used, sometimes for precedence, as huic
equidem consilio palmam do, in Terence, sometime for the victory it self, as
non auferent tamen hanc palmam, in Pliny; and plurimarum palmarum homo, for a
man that had won many prizes in the fence* school, in Cicero pro Roscio: but
for the sign of victory more naturally, as in that of Horace, -- Palmaque
nobilis
Terrarum dominos evehit ad deos.
The palm the sign of victory
Does equal men to Gods on high.


Sithence that Cyrene, and the I Will Pharos, are reckoned as part of Egypt; we
will describe them here, as members of the same body.

CYRENE has on the East Egypt; on the West, the kingdom of Tunis; on the
North, the Mediterranean; and on the South the hill Atlas. The most ancient
name has been Pontapolitana, from the five Cities, Cyrene, Ptolomais,
Arsinoe, Apollonia, and Berenice. The soil is barren both of fruits, and
waters, the people rude, and living by theft: yet has it given air to the
ingenious spirits, of Aristippus the Philosopher, Callimachus the Poet,
Eratosthenes the Mathematician, and Simon of Cyrene, whom the Jews compelled
to carry our Saviors Cross.

In the borders of this Country toward Barbary, stood the famous altars, called
Arae Philenorum, erected on this occasion. There had been many iarres and
discontents, between the citizens of Carthage and Cyrene, for their bounds. At
last it was agreed, that at a set time, two men should be sent out of each
Town, toward the other; and where they met, there should be erected a boundary
of their several dominions. These Phil^ni, being appointed for Carthage made
such have, that they got far into the Country of the Cyrenenses, before they
we^e met. Whereupon the Cyrenenses being enraged, offered them a bad choice;
either to die in the place, or to go back out of their Country. The young men
preferring common good before private safety, accepted the first; were
murdered: and the Carthaginians in their honors founded these altars.

In this Country stood the Oracle of Jupiter Hammon, whither when Alexander
traveled, he saw for four days space, neither Man, Beast, Bird, Tree, nor
River: this Temple lying on the more Southern part of the Country, which is
sick of the same disease with Numidia, and Lybia. For this Country is all over
covered with a light sand, which the winds remove continually up and down,
turning valleys into hills, and hills into valleies. Cambises that cruel and
bloody king, as irreuerently esteeming the Gods, as he bas^ly handled his
subjects, sent his army hither to overthrow this Temple. But in the passage
toward it, his whole forces were overwhelmed, and smothered with the sands,
being to the number of 50000 fighting men.

The chief Cities of Cyrene at this present, are Cyrene which of old had
emulation with Carthage, for great^^s of the town, and extent of the
territory. 2 Fessan. 3 Barca, the name giver to the whole Country.

PHAROS is a little Island over against Alexandria, in which for the commodity
of Sailors, the king Ptolomeus Philadelphus built a watch tower, which was
accounted one of the 7 wonders of the world: the other 6 being 1 the Pyramides.
2 Mausol^^um. 3 The Temple of Ephesus. 4 The walls of Babylon. 5 The Colossus
of Rhodes. And 6 the statue of Jupiter Olympisus. This watch-towre, or Pharus,
was of wonderful height, ascended by degrees, and having many Lanternes at the
top, wherein l^ghts burned nightly, as a direction to such as sailed by Sea.
The materials were white marble; the chief Architect, Sostratus of Guid^s;
who ingraued on the work this inscription, Sostratus of G^idos, the son of
Dexiphanes, to the Gods protectors, for the safeguard of Sailors. This
inscription he covered with plaster, and thereon ingraued the name and title
of the king the founder; that that soon wasting and washed away, his own
which was written in marble, might be eternized to posterity. Nigh unto this
Pharus, Caesar pursuing Pompey into Egypt, and having discontented the king
thereof, by demanding pay for his Soldiers; had his Navy, which here lay at
anchor, assaulted by Achilles, one of young Ptolomies servants, Caesar himself
being then in Alexandria. Hearing of the skirmish he hasted to Pharos, meaning
to succor his navy in person: but the Egypti^ns making toward him on all
sides, he was compelled to leap into the Sea, and swim for his life; and
though to avoid their Darts he sometimes ducke^, ^et held he still his left
hand above the water, and in it diverse books, which he carried safe unto his
ships, and animating his men got the victory. It is said that Egypt has only
two doors; one by land, which is the strong Town of P^lusium or Damiat^^ the
other by water, which is this Pharus. Tota Aegyptus maritimo accessi^, Pharo;
pedestri ve^o, (...), velut cla^^^tri^ muruta existimatur.

Here also was the artificial Tower, built by Ptolomie, which being by reason
of magic ench^ntments impregnable, was by him laid level to the ground wi^h
a handful of beans; of which thus our Sp^^c^r discoursing of K. Ri^nce's
g^asse, Who wonders not that reads so wondrous work,
But who does wonder that has read the Tower;
Wherein the Egyptian Phao long did lurk
From all men's view, that none might her discou're;
Yet she might all men view out of her bower.
Great Ptolomie it for his Lemans sake
Ybuilded all of glass by Magic power;
And also it impregnable did make.
But when his love proved false, he with a Bean it brake.

Mauethon in his history of Egypt makes a Catalogue of 300 kings wanting
eight, which reigned before Amasis, under 17 several Dynasties, whose names it
would be needless and tedious to recite: considering the fabulous reports, and
uncertainties, which are related of them. Osiris only is worthy mention, in
whose time it is thought Abraham went down into Egypt. He, and his
successors, were all called Pharaohs, whom we will omit till we come to Amasis:
who for his politic institutions, deserves to stand in the forefront of the
catalogue, as fou^der of this kingdom.

ruled 68 years. 2550 16 Menophis, or Miris* 40

Amenophis III, 26. 2777 21 Thuoris 7.
Of these five Latti, two only are of fame, viz: Amenophis, of whom we have
already related a pretty story: and Vexores, or Sesostris, who being a Prince
of great wealth and puissance, had brought in subjection all his neighboring
kings; whom he compelled in turns to draw his Chariot. It happened that one of
these unfortunate Princes, cast his eye many times on the coach wheels; and
being by Sesostris demanded the cause of his so doing, he replied: that the
falling of that spoke lowest, which but ^ust before was in the height of the
wheel, put him in mind of the instabilitie of fortune. The king deeply
waighing the parable, would never afterward be so drawn in his Chariot. He
also was the first that encountered the Scythians in battle; for having already
in conceit conquered them, he led his army against them. The Scythians
marvelled that a king of so great revenues would wage war against a nation
so poor, with whom the fight would be doubtful, the victory unprofitable, but
to be vanquished a perpetual infamy and disgrace. For their par^s they
resolved to meet him as an enemy whose overthrowe would enrich them. When the
armies came to join, the E^^ptians were discomfited, and pursued even to their
own doors by the enemy. But the Scythians could not enter the country, because
of the sens; with whose passages they were unacquainted; and so they returned.

The 20 Dynastie of the Princes Diapolitani, ruled Egypt 177 years, after
which followed the 21 Dynastie of these K.

member of his Empire; under which it continued subject till the days of Darius

18 year of the reign of this King, Egypt was again recovered by the valor of
Ochus, the eight Emperor of Persia. And when Alexander had overthrown Darius,
he came, and without blows won this fertile kingdom, which yielded him,
during his life, the yearly value of 6000 talents. After his death, this
kingdom fell to the share of Ptolomeus the son of Lagi, from whom all the
subsequent Kings of Egypt were called Ptolomies.
The Ptolemean Kings of Egypt,

of most exquisite beauty: she killed her self that she might not be ledd in
triumph through Rome. These Ptolomean Princes of Egypt, were for the most part
in wars with the kings of Syria, in which they were by turns victorious, and
vanquished: neither Prince having cause to boast of his bargain. After the
death of Cleopatra, whose life and love with Marcus Antonius, I will not now
relate; this Country fell to the share of the Roman Emperors, and was by them
highly prized, and warily looked into. The Governor hereof, was at the best
but a Gentleman of Rome; no Senator being permitted to come into it: it being a
maxim of state, not to suffer men of great houses, to come into that country,
whose revolt may endanger the whole Empire. Of this nature was Egypt, for
besides the natural situation of the place very defensible; and besides the
abundance of money with which it was stored* this Country alone ^urnished the
City of Rome with corn for four months yearly: whence Vespasian being
chosen Emperor by the Syrian legions, and hearing of the defeat of his
concurrent Vitellius, hastened hither, to this end only, that detaining the
ordinary provision of victuals, he might by famine compel the City of Rome,
to stand at his devotion, Vt vrbem quoque, externae opis indigam fame vrgeret.
When the seat of the Empire was transferred, the Egyptians were under the
Emperors of Constantinople; w^ose burden being i^supportable they implored the
aid of the Saracens: who driving thence the Greekish garrisons, made them
tributary to Haumar, the 3d Caliph of Bagdet. Afterward they chose a Caliph of
their own nation, and revolted quite from the obedience of the old rank of
Caliphs; so that hence forth ye have two Caliphs or Saracenicall Popes, the
one resident at Caire, to whom the Moors or Saracens of Afric and Europe
submitted themselves: the other at Bagdet or Babylon, who Lorded it oue^ ^he
rest.

4 Eladel. 5 Elchanel. 6 Essalach: and 7 Elmutam, after whose death, slain, as
he says by one Azeddin Ibik, the Mamaluckes made themselves Masters of Egypt.
But by the leave of so worthy a man, this cannot hold good: or the Mamalucks,
as we shall anon see, succeeded not the Caliphs in the government of Egypt; but
the Turkish kings. As for the names recited, I suppose them only to be the
names of the Turkish kings, corrupted, or altered, according to the diversity
of language; for who sees not Sarracon to be meant by Assareddin, Salad^ne,
by Zeliheddin and Selaheddin; Meledine, in Eladel; and Melechsala, in Essalach.
But I see only with mine own eyes, perhaps another will not so discern them.

Elphaiz the last Caliph, being ouercharged with the forces of Almericus King
of Jerusalem; sent for succor to Noradine, a Turkish king of Damasco, Knolles.
who sent unto his aid Sarracon, a valiant and circumspect warrior. He not
only cleared the coast of Almericus forces, but made himself the absolute king
of the whole Country: and the better to secure his estate, he dashed out the
brains of the Caliph with his horsemans mace, and then rooted out all his
kindred, and issue.

The Turkish Kings of Egypt.
1153 1 Sarracon, the first Turkish king of Egypt. 1156 2 Saladine, that
glorious Conqueror of the East, who wanted no virtue to eternize him in
succeeding ages, nor no gift to glorify him in the kingdom of heaven, but the
saving knowledge of Christ 16. 1172 3 Saphradine, the only son of n^ne, which
escaped the fury of his most execrable Uncle. 4 Meledine, who overcame the
Christians without the loss of a man, at the siege of Caire; by letting loose
the sluices of Nilus: which drowning their Army, enforced them to covenant at
his pleasure. 1249 5 Melechsela a worthy Prince, who overcame S. Lewis the
ninth, king of France; and going with him toward Damiata, was villanously
slain by his Soldiers, called Mamaluckes.
These Mamaluckes were the offspring of Georgia, and Colchis, vulgarly called
the Circassi: whom this Melechs^la bought either of their parents, or of the
Tartars, then newly possessed of these Countries, to supply the defect of the
effeminate Egyptians. These slaves now knowing their own abilities, slew their
Lord and Master Melechsela; and appointed one Turquimeneius, a man of great
spirit and valor, for their king; and loath to re-giue the supreme authority
into the hands of the Egyptians, nor permitting their sons the name and
prerogative of Mamaluckes; they year by year chose some of their own
Country, whom they gave to diverse countrymen to learn the languages and
religion of Mahomet. This being effected, they allotted them to higher
preferment, using such discipline with them, as the Turks do now with their
Ianizaries: who perchance may make as great a mutation in the Turkish Empire,
as the Mamaluck^s did in the Egyptian. So unsafe it is for a Prince to commit
the tuition of his person, or the defense of his Realm to such; whom hope of
profit, and not natural allegiance makes faithful. Our Constance was
murdered by his Guard of Picts. Most of the Roman Emperors by such Soldiers,
whom hope of prey, not free service to the Prince, drew into the field. And I
think no man is ignorant how often principalities, especially those of Italy,
have been endangered by mercenary Martialists. Francisco Sforza fought under
the banners of the Millanoys, and on hope of more allowance revolted to the
Florentines, the enemies of that Duchy. Guiacopo Picinino with his
dependants, followed the ensigns of Ferdinand of Naples; left him to fight for
his vowed enemy, John of Aniou; whom also he forsook in his greatest need. I
will not specify, yet I will not exempt the Switzers, and their dealing in
this kind toward the French: so that I may apply that which the Gospel
speaks of the hireling Ministers, to the hireling Soldier, They will fly
when the enemy comes, and not lay down their life for their flock. Now as
it is unsafe for a Prince to commit the guard of his person to the faith of
forrainers: so also is it dangerous for him, in the defense of his Realm or
State, to rely on their fidelity. A moderate supply of men, money, or munition,
from a confederate King, is, I confess, in most cases convenient, in some
necessary: as well to save the natives from the sword; as to try a friend, and
interest an allie in the same cause. But to inuit so great a number of
succors, as from helpers may become Masters, and oppress the people whom they
came to defend: is that rock on which many Realms have suffered shipwreck;
and which a good Pilot of the state, should with all care avoid. For as in the
sickness of the body natural, it is hurtful to a man's health and life, to
take more physic then it may (after the effect thereof be wrought) either
digest, or put out again: so in the body politic, it is a perilous matter to
receive more succors, then what (after they have done the deed they were sent
for) we may either with conueniency reward and settle with us; or at liberty
expel. Of all surfets, this of foreign supplies is most incurable; and Ne
quid nimis, if in nothing else true, is in this case, oracle. There is no
kingdom (I am verily persuaded) under the Sun, which has not been by this
means conquered; no Commonwealth, which has not been by this means ruined.
To relate all examples, were infinite and tedious: to infer some, pleasing to
the reader; and to illustrate the point, not unnecessary. To begin with
former times. Philip of Maced^n, called into Greece, to assist the Thebans
against the Phocians, brought all that Country under his command. The Romans
by ayding the Sicilians against the Carthaginians, possessed themselves of that
flourishing Island: by assisting the Hodui, against the Sequani, mastred France:
by succouring Androgeus, against Cassibelan, seized on Britain: by siding
with the Aetolians, against Perseus, united to their Empire, all the Empire of
Macedon; and by the same course what not? In after ages, the Britains called
in the Saxons, and were by them thrust out of all: the Irish called in the
English, by whom they were in process of time totally subdued: and the Indians
called in the Mongull Tartars, who now Lord it over them. These foreign
supplies are invited or let into a Country, commonly in three cases. First,
when some one man upon discontent, or desire of revenge, opens a way for
them; and so Count Julian let the Sarracens into Spain, to revenge himself on
Don Rodrigo, who had ravished his daughter. 2ly, When a weaker faction makes
way for them, to overthrow or counterpoise the stronger: so the Burgundians
oppressed by the faction of Orleans, made way for Henry the fifth to pass into
France: and so the English Barons likely to be vanquished by king John, sent
for Prince Lewis into England. And 3ly when a king ouerburdened by a foreign
^oe, whom he is neither able to repel or resist, makes use of a foreign
friend; which may chance to prove a physic worse then the sickness, and in
which cases plus a ^^dico est quam a morbo mali: so the Neapolitans being
ouerlaid by the French, implored the aid of the Spaniards: and so the last
Caliph of this Egypt, where we now are, being ouercharged by Almericus king of
Jerusalem, received succors from the Turks: by which means both these
kingdoms became a prey to their friends, and avoiding Scylla, fell into
Charybdis. Nay sometimes it so happens, that these foreign succors join with
those whom they came to expel, and having vanquished the natives, divided the
Country between them: and so we find the Burgundians, being by Stilico called
into Gallia to expel the Franks then newly entered; to have joined forces with
these Franks, and never to have parted, till they had in a manner cast the
deceived Romans quite out of Gaul. Only among so many histories, we find the
Low-countrymen to have thriued by these courses, who by the assistance of
foreign friends cleared themselves from the fangs of Spain: which objection I
confess to be true, and for the honor and integrity of the English nation, am
above measure glad of it; who saw no further then the defense of their
neighbors, and aimed at no other end then the virtue it self.. But give me
the like instance and I will quit my cause; for the same Low-countreymen, found
the French and German Soldiers, under the Prince of Orange, to be but
turne-tailes; and as for Francis Duke of Alanson, whom they had made Duke of
Brabant, and their governor general: his chief plot was to make himself an
absolute tyrant over them. So that I think I may safely conclude, that
foreign succors are of all remedies, the least to be trusted, and the last to
be tried: but it is now more then time that I returned unto the Mamaluckes.

The Mamalucke Sultans of Egypt.
1250 Knolles.
1 Turquimeneius, being promoted to this kingdom, released king Lewis taken
prisoner (as is above said) by his predecessor Melechsela: but performed not
half the conditions of the peace. 2 Clothes, or as others call him, Melech,
taking advantage of the miseries of the Turks, in his time shrewdly shaken by
the Tartars; seized on the greater part of Syria, and Palestine. 1260 3
Bandocader, perfected the begun conquests of Melech. He took the strong
City of Antioch, and the Country about it, from the Christians; and entering
into Armenia, did there great harm also. 4 Melechsait, or Melechsares, in part
repaired the Mamalucks kingdom in Syria and Palestine, which had been
shrewdly shaken by Edw the first, then Prince of England; and Henry Duke of
Mecklebourge. 1289 5 Elpis or Alphix, established the conquests of his
predecessor: he took the Cities of Tripolis, Beritus, Sidon, and Tire: all
which he razed, that they might not be serviceable to the affairs of the
Christians. 1291 6 Araphus, or Eustrephus, by birth a German, released Henry
Duke of Mecklebourge, after he had been prisoner 26 years. He rooted the
Christians out of Syria, took Ptolomais the last Town they there held; and so
razed it that he made it fit to be ploughed. 7 Melechnesar, when he was
Lieftenant to Araphus, was discomfited by Cassanes, a great Prince of the
Tartars, with the loss of 40000 Egyptians: but Cassanes being departed, he
recovered again all Syria, and destroyed Jerusalem; for which service he was
afterward made Sultan of Egypt. 8 Melechadel, whom I suppose to be that Sultan
that governed Egypt, when Tamerlane with irresistable violence conquered it;
but of this I am no certain: neither can I meet with so much as the names of
any of his successors, till Caithbeius. 1465 9 Caithbeius much reformed the
state of Egypt, and was a stout enemy of the Turkish Sultan Ba^azet the 2d.
1498 10 Mahomet, son to Caithbeius, was by the Mamaluckes deposed; it being
contrary to their custom, that the son should in the kingdom or name of
Mamaluck succeed the father. He being deposed there arose diverse factions in
the Court; insomuch that in three years, here were four Sultans, viz: this
Mahomet, 2 Campsous Chiarcesius, 3 Zanballat, 4 Ton^mbeius. 1501 11 Campson
Gaurus, reformed the distracted and factious state of this Country, and for 16
years governed very prosperously: but siding at last with Hismael the Persian
Sophie, against Selimus the first Emperor of the Turks; he drew his kingdom
into a war, in which his armies were overthrown, and himself slain in the
battle. 1517 12 Tononibeius, succeeded Campson, as in his Empire, so in his
misfortunes: for he was overcome by Selimus the first, 1517; and Egypt was
made a Province of the Turkish Empire, and so continues.
The revenues of this kingdom, were in the time of the Ptolomies, no less
then 12000 Talents. Nor were they much less if ought be at all, when the
Mamalucks ruled in this country: For Campson Guarus at his Coronation, gave no
less then ten millions of Ducats at one clap amongst his Soldiers. But the
Turks at this day, partly through their tyrannical government; and partly
through the discontinuance of the usual traficke through the Red Sea; receive
no more then three millions: one of which, is hoorded in his own Coffers; the
second is appropriated unto his Vicegerent Bashaw, for support of his charge;
the third is distributed amongst his Presid^arie Soldiers, and such of them,
as by land, guard his own mi^^on to Constantinople; for by Sea he dares not
venture it, for fear of the Florentines.

Thus much of Egypt.

THE AFRICAN ISLES.
The AFRICAN Islands are either in the Ethiopicke sea, as Magadascar. Zocotara.
in the Atla^ticke sea, as S. Thomas. The Princes Island. The Gorgades. The
Canaries. The Azores. The Hesperides.



1 MAGADASCAR, called also the Island of S. Laurence, abounds with all manner
of fruits; as also Beasts wild and tame. The inhabitants are of a duskie
color, curled hair, and Idolaters. The chief Town is Magadascar. This Island
is in length 1200, in compass 4000 miles; and situate under the Southern
Tropique. It was discovered by the Portugalls, Ao 1506; The people are
treacherous and vnhospitable; they used not to trade with others, neither
suffered they others to trade with them: and though the Portugalls have
obtained a little traffic with them, yet are they not permitted to come on
land. The soil yields cloves, Ginger, and Silver; it is enriched with safe
harbors, fair rivers, and plenty of fruit, and cattle: a Country too good
for so base a people. For besides their two good qualities aboue-mentioned,
they are ignorant of prayer, and festivals: they have no distinction of months
or years, neither have they any proper names for the days of the week. The
only thing laudable in the^ is the restraining themselves to one wife.

2 ZOCOTARA lies just at the mouth of the Red Sea, and is some 10 degrees
North from the Equator; being in length 60, in breadth 24 miles. This Island is
much troubled with winds, molested with dryness, and wants most things
convenient to vital sustenance. The chief City is Zocotara, the place of the
kings residence: whose subjects are of tall stature, ash^e color, and before
the arrival of the Portugalls, a kind of Christians, in sect Iacobites. The
Portugalls have here taken and fortified two Towns, viz: Coro, and Benin. The
Island though deficient in necessaries to life, is yet well replenished with
Apothecaries drugges, and in especial it yields the Aloe Zocatrina, Nigh
hereunto are two Islands, the one inhabited by men only, the other only by
women, who at certain times do meet but stay not long together: the air of
the one (as it is reported) not being healthie to the others inhabitants.

3 St THOMAS is in compass 180 miles: It is of a round figure, and lies
directly under the Equinoctial line. It is so fruitful of sugar, that 40
ships are laden with it every year: The prime City is Pavoasan. When it was
first discovered, it was nothing but a wood; but is now inhabited by
Portugalls, and Negroes: the Negroes attaining diverse times to 100 years of
age; the Portugalls never exceeding 50. Wheat here sown never comes to any
good; neither will it bear any fruit that has a stone in it.

4 The I Will Del Principe, or the PRINCES ISLAND, is situate between the
Equator, and the Tropicke of Capricorn; nigh unto it is the I Will of Helens:
they are both under the command of the Spaniard. The last took name from the
Saints day where on it was discovered; and the first, because when the
Portugalls had conquered it, the revenues hereof were allotted to the Portugal
Prince.

5 The GORGADES, anciently called the Gorgons, where Medusa, and her two sister
dwelt. This Medusa is said by the Poets, to have been a woman of great beauty;
who either for suffering her body to be abused by Neptune in one of the Temples
of Pallas; or for pre^erring her self before Pallas: had by the same Goddess
her hair turned into snakes, and t^is property annexed unto the^, that
whosoever looked on her, should ^e turned into stones; which quality it
retained after she was slain, and beheaded by Perseus. Thus, and far more
fabulously the Poets. The Historians (for as some think omnis fabula fundatur
in historia) relate, how this Medusa was indeed a Lady of such exceeding
beauty, that all men that saw her were amazed; and of such wise and subtle
brain, that for that cause only men attributed unto her a Serpents head: She
abounding in wealth, and by piracie molesting the Seas of Europe, was invaded
by an army of Grecians, under the leading of Perseus, who in a single combat
slew her. Perseus when he plucked off her helmet, admiring that beauty which he
had destroy^d, cut off her head and carried it unto Greece: where the people
beyond measure wondered at the rare compositure of her face, and the exceeding
beauty of her hair; and are therefore said to have by her head bin
metamorphosed into stones. So Pausanias in h^s Crrinthiacs. These Islands are in
number nine; and because they are situate nigh to Cape Viride in the land of
Negros, are called Insulae Capitis Viridis. They all do abound with Goats. The
chief is S. James; whose prime town is Ribiera, at this time fortified by the
Spaniards.

6 The CANARIES are in number seven. From these Islands come our Canarie wines;
which* fume into the head less, please the palate more, and better help the
natural weakness of a cold stomach, then any other wines whatsoever. The
Islands abound in Canarie Birds, and sugar Canes, of which our best Marmolets
are made. The Islands were anciently for their fertility, and rare immunities,
called the Fortunate Islands; but now Canaries, either from the abundance of
Dogs, which the Spaniards found here; or from the I Will Canarie, which was then
the chief. The second of much note is Palma, where ships use to touch going
toward America. The third Ten^riffe, 90 miles round: the inhabitants of which
never heard of a shower or river; but receive all their fresh water from a most
high mountain, wherein there is a tree covered continually with a moist cloud,
which every noone dissolueth into water, and is by cisternes conveyed into
diverse parts of the Island. The other four are Gomera, 2 Hierro, 3 Lansarotte,
and 4 Fuerte Ventura; in a^l which it was accounted the basest office in the
world to slay a beast, and therefore that charge belonged unto their prisoners.
Their flesh they did eat raw, for want of fire; and tilled (or rather turned
up) the ground with ox horns. Wives they had many, with who^ they used for
hospitalities sake, to lodge their friends; and in like courtesy to accompany
theirs: this being as familiar and ordinary a complement in some places, as
kissing is with us.

7 THE AZORES are in number 9, viz: 1 S. Marie; 2 S. Michael, 3 Gratiosa, 4. S.
George, 5 Pico, 6 Faiall, 7 Flores, 8 Corvo, 9 Tercera, which being the
principal, gives now name to all the rest, being called at this day the
Tercera's. They were first discovered by the Flemings, and called the Flemish
Islands. Tercera it self abounds in Oade, called by us Island Oade: It is in
compass 18 miles, and was the last place that held out for Don Antonio against
the Castilians. The second Island of note is S. Michaell, famous in that our
modern Geographers, have from the Canaries, or Fortunate Islands (where the
ancient Geographers placed it) removed hereunto the first Meridian, whose
office is to d^uide the East part of the World, from the West: and secondly,
because the Compass when it comes under the Meridian line, drawn through
this I Will, has not (as the Mariners observe) any variation at all, but
points directly to the North: whereas in other parts, or lesser Meridians
East and W^st, it points not directly North, but more or less to the
North-east, or to the North-west; and this is called the variation, or the
North-westing, and the North easting of the compass. The third Island of note
is F^iall, taken by Sir Walter Raleigh, Anno 1597, maugre all opposition of the
Spaniards. This Action was called the Island voyage, and was undertaken as well
to divert the war, which the Spaniards threatened to bring to our own home; as
by seasing on some of these I^ands, to interrupt the Spanish Fleet in their
return, or hinder them in their setting out: by which means the Spaniards
wanting their Indian ^old, might be brought to more conformity. And though the
English kept not their winnings, yet so rich was the booty purchased in this
expedition, that it amounted to 400000 Crowns. All these Islands were subdued
by the Portugalls, under the conduct of Prince Henry, (son to Alphonso the
fifth, and father to John the second) who first made the Portugals in love with
the seas, Anno 1444.

8 The HESPERIDES, situate not far from the Gorg^des, are often memorized by
the Poets. For here dwelt the daughters of Atlas; here grew the golden apples
kept by a dragon, and taken hence by Hercules; and here was the abode of
blessed creatures, said to be called the Elysian fields. Of any Writer in my
conceit, Plutarch best describes them, and out of him I afford it unto you;
(...), etc. These two Islands are parted by a little straight of the sea, and are
distant from the continent of Africa 10000 furlongs. They have rain there very
seldom, but a fine sweet dew, which makes the earth very fertile, with little
or no pains to the husbandman. The weather is continually fair, the seasons
all temperate, and the Air never extreme. A blessed country, wherein Sertorius
desirous now to live quietly, hearing report of it, had an earnest desire to
pass away the remnant of his days. So far, and to this purpose Plutarch.

Thus much of the African Isles.

THE END OF AFRICA.
OF AMERICA.
THis great tract of Land is most aptly called the NEW WORLD. New, for the late
discovery; and World, for the vast spaciousness of it. Purcha^.
The most usual, and yet somewhat improper name, is AMERICA, because Americus
Vespuccius discovered it: but sithence Columbus gave us the first light to
discern these Countries, both by example and directions; and Sebastianus Cabot
touched at many parts of the Continent which Americus never saw: why is it not
as well called Columbana, Sebastiana, or Cabotia? The most improper name of all,
yet most usual among Mariners, is the WESTERN INDIES: Western, because of
the West situation; and India, because by that one name they express all
wealthy (if remote) countries.

Many are of an opinion, and that rather grounded on coniecturall
probabilities, then demonstratiue arguments; that this America was known long
before our late discoueries. Their first reason is drawn from the doctrine of
the Antipodes, which being among the ancient Philosophers, cannot but infer a
knowledge of these parts: to which we answer, that there was indeed a
knowledge of the Antipodes by demo^stratio^ only; but not in fact: or if you
will, we will say that it was known there were Antipodes; but the Antipodes
were not known. Secondly, they say that Hanno a Carthaginian Captain,
discovered a great Island: but he (says Mela) sailed not Westward, but
Southward, and lighted on a great Island, which whatsoever it was (perhaps
Magadascar) sure I am it was not America, and returned home, wanting not (as he
told the Senate) Sea-room, but victuals. Thirdly they produce these verses of
Seneca, to infer a knowledge of this great Country.

-- Venient annis
Secula seris, quibus Oceanus
Vincula rerum laxet, and ingens
Pateat tellus, nec sit te^ris
Vltima Thule. --
In after-age the time shall come,
In which the all-deuouring foame
Shall loose its proper bounds, and show
Another Continent to view:
Nor frozen Island shall we see
The utmost part of The Earth to be.
This argument (I hope) can bring no necessary or probable illation to
apprehensiue ears; for the Poet in this Chorus, shows as well the continual
dangers, as possible effects of navigation; that there might be, not that there
were more nations discovered, then were known Fourthly, some affirm these
Indies to be the land of Ophir, to which Solomon sent his Navy for Gold But
Ezion-Geber, where this Navy lay at anchor, till victuals and necessary
tacklings were provided; was situate in the very mouth of the Red sea; whereas
if he had sent this way, his course had bin by the Mediterranean Seas, through
the streights of Gibraltar, and so Westward through the vast Ocean. Fifthly, our
more curious then profound Antiquaries observe, the British language to be
here spoken in former times; and to have left some smatterings of it till this
day, namely that a bird with a whitie head is called Pengwin; and the like* And
therefore went about to entitle Q Elizabeth to the sovereignty of these
Countries: but she wisely did reject these counsels, and not loving to put her
sith into another man's harvest, knew that as well Welch-men, as others, might
by force of tempest be driven to these parts; and having no possibility of
return, might easily implant some part of their language in the memories of
the people: So that yet we may conclude, that this country was unknown to
former ages.

Now, as Mela the Geographer says of Britain, then newly conquered by the
Romans: Britannia qualis sit, qualesque progeneret; mox certiora, and magis
explorata dicentur: quippe tam diu clausam apperit ecce principium maximus, (he
means Claudius Caesar) nec indomitarum modo, sed and incognitarum ^nte se
gentium victor: so may I say of America. What kind of Country America is, and
what men it produces, we shall continually hereafter know more certainly:
since those puiss^nt Princes of Spain have opened unto us the Country so long
undiscovered; and inhabited not only by vnvanquisht, but unknown Nations. For
God remembering the promise of his son, that his Gospel before the general
Judgment, should be preached to the people of every Nation: stirred up
Christ^pher Colon, or Columbus, borne at Nerui in the Country of Genoa, a man
of an heroicke spirit, borne (as it seems) to attempt new matters. He
considering the motion of the Sun, could not persuade himself, but that
there was another world, to which the Sun imparted his light, after his
departure from our Horizon. This world he hoped to discover, and opening his
intent to the Genowaies, Anno 1486, was by them rejected. Hereupon he sent his
brother Bartholomew Columbus, to motion the matter to Henry the 7th, then King
of England: but he unfortunately happened into the hands of Pirates, who after long
imprisonment, enlarged him As Soon as he was at liberty, he came to the English
Court, and solicited his brothers cause: the King joyfully entertained the
action, and sent for Christopher Columbus to come unto him. But God had
otherwise disposed of this rich purchase; for Columbus not knowing of his
brothers imprisonment, nor hearing any thing of his hoped success: thought his
proffer to have bin neglected or contemned; and thereupon he made his desires
known at the Court of Castile; where after many delays, he was furnished with
two ships only; and those not for the conquest, but discovery. With this small
assistance, he sailed in the maine Ocean, more then 60 days, yet could not as
yet descry any land; so that the discontented Spaniards began a mutiny, and
desirous to return, would not go a foot forward. At last the wary Italian,
seeing the clouds carry a clearer color, then hitherto they had done; and
thinking that this clearenesse proceeded from some nigh habitable places;
restrained the time of their expectation within the compass of three days: in
that space, if no land offered it self to their view, engaging himself to
return. At the end of these three days, one of the company descried fire, an
evident argument of the adjacent Country: which presently after, they
apparently discerned, Anno 1492. This Region was an Island, by the inhabitants
called Hailie; but by Columbus in honor of the Spaniards, Hispaniola Afterward
he discovered Cuba, and with much treasure and greater content, he returned to
Spain-ward: and after two great navigations (besides this) finished, he died,
and lies buried at Seuill. The Spaniards notwithstanding the good service of
this man, did not stick after his death only, to deprive him of the honor of
these discoueries, attributing it to I know not what Spaniard, whose Cards and
descriptions this Columbus had met withal: but in his life also they would
often say, that it was a matter of no such difficulty to have found out these
Countries; and that if he had not done it, some-bodie else might.

At the first arrival of the Spaniards into this Country, they found the
people without all manner of apparel, naught skilled in Agriculture, making
their bread of a kind of root, called Maiz, a root wherein is a venomous
liquor, not inferior to most deadly poisons; but this juice they crush out,
and after having dried and prepared the root, make their bread of it. They
worshipped devilish spirits, whom they called Zemes; in remembrance of whom
they kept continually certain images as it were, made of cotton wool, like to
our childrens babies. To these they did do great reverence, as supposing the
spirit of their Zemes to be in them: and the devil to blind them the more,
would make th^s^ puppets seem to move, and make a noise. They stood also in
great fear of them; for if their wills were not fulfilled, the devil straight
executed vengeance on some of the children of this blinded and infatuated
people. They thought the Christians to be immortal, wondering at the masts,
sails, and tacklings of their ships, (themselves knowing no ships, but ^uge
troughs made of some great-bodied trees) but this opinion of the Christians
immortality continued not long; for having taken some of them, they held their
heads under the water till they were choked; by which they knew them to be
mortal. They were quite destitute of all good learning, reckoning their times
by a confused observation of the Moon; and strangely admiring to see one
Spaniard know the health and affairs of another, by a letter only. They were
of a simple honest nature, without fraud, giving entertainment after their
kind, and grossly conceived the immortality of the soul, supposing that
beyond certain hills, they knew not where, those that died in defense of their
country, should enjoy eternal happiness. They esteemed of Gold and Silver, as
of dross, with which notwithstanding for the color sake they adorned
themselves, as also with Shells, Feathers, and the like, etc.

The inhabitants (though a great part of this Country lies in the same
parallel with Ethiopia, Lybia, and Numidia) are of a reasonable fair
complexion, and very little (if at all) inclining to blackness. So that the
extraordinary and continual vicinity of the Sun, is not (as some imagine)
the operative cause of blackness: though it may much further such a color; as
we see in our Country lasses, whose faces always are exposed to wind and
weather. Others, more wise in their own conceit, though this conceit know no
confederate, plainly conclude the generatiue seed of the Africans to be black;
but of the Americans to be white: a foolish supposition, and convinced not only
out of experience, but natural Philosophy. As for that foolish tale of Cham's
knowing his wife in the Arc, whereupon by divine curse his son Chus with all
his posterity, (which they say are the Africans) were all black: it is so
vain, that I will not endeavor to refell it. So that we must whol^y refer it
to Gods peculiar will and ordinance.

They are without question the progeny of the Tartars, which may be proved by
many arguments, some negative, some also affirmative. The negative arguments
are, 1 they have no relish nor resemblance at all, of the Arts, Learning, and
ciuility of Europe. Secondly, their color shows them not to have descended
from the Africans, here being no black men in all this Country, but some few
which inhabit the seacoasts over against Guinea in Afric: from whence they
are supposed by some tempest to have bin brought hither. Thirdly, they have not
the least token or show, of the Arts or industry of China, India, or any civil
Region on that side of Asia. The affirmative arguments prove first, that they
came from Asia; next in particular from Tartarie. That they came out of Asia,
is more then manifest, in that the west side of the Country toward Asia, is
far more populous then the East toward Europe: of which there can be no
other reason assigned, then that these parts were first inhabited; and that
from hence the rest was peopled. Next for the next, the idolatry of this
people, and the particularities thereof; their inciuility and barbarous
properties, tell us that they are most like the Tartars, of any. Secondly the
west side of America, if it be nor Continent with Tartary, is yet disioyned by
a very small straight, as may be perceived in all our mappes, and Cards; as
also in the descriptions of these Countries: So that there is into these
Countries, a very quick and easy passage. And thirdly the people of Quivira,
which of all the Provinces of America is the nearest unto Tartary, are said to
follow in the whole course of their life, the seasons and best pasturing of
their oxen; just like the Scythian Nomades, or Tartarian hords: an evident
argument of their descent and original.

The Sp^^iards since their coming hither, have behaved themselves most
inhumanely toward the unarmed Natives; killing them up like sheep for the
slaughter; and forcing them like beasts to labor in their mines, carry all
burdens, and do al drudgeries. Haythney, a Nobleman, being with many
applausiue arguments persuaded to embrace the Christian Religion; demanded
first, what place was ordained for such as were baptized, answer was made,
Heaven and its joys: Secondly, what place was bequeathed to them who would not
be baptized; answer was made, Hell and its torments: Thirdly, which of these
places was allotted to the Spaniards; and when answer was made, that Heaven
was: he renounced his intended baptism; protesting, that he had rather go to
Hell with the unbaptized, then to live in heaven with so cruel a people. The
rest were driven to the Font, like so many horses to a watringplace; and were
received into the Church of Christ thick and threefold: Insomuch, that one old
Friar, (as himself confessed to Charles the fifth) sprinkled with the water of
baptism, 700000: another 300000 of them: but never instructed them in the
articles of faith, or points of Christian Religion. Yet here our holy father
the Pope, has raised up a new Empire, instead of that which lately fell from
his jurisdiction in Europe. This Church he governs by 4 Archbishops, Grimston.
of Mexico, Lima, S. Foy, and Dominico; as also by 25 inferior Bishops, all
nusled up in his superstition.

The politic administration of Justice is committed to the two Vice-Royes,
residing at Lima and Mexico: who gather also the Kings revenues, which being
the fifth part of every man's labor, amount to the yearly value of 3 millions
of Crowns, and upward.

When this new world came first acquainted with the old, Isabel Queen of
Castile, would not permit any of her husband Ferdinando's subjects to adventure
here, viz: Arragonians, or Valentians: but licenced the Castilians,
Andalusians, Biscaines, and the rest of her own people only; envying the
wealth hereof to the rest. When she was dead, Fernando licenced generally all
the Spaniards, excluding only the Portugals. But so rich a prize could not so
warily be fenced, but that Portugals, French, English, and now of late the
Low-countrimen, have laid in their own barnes, part of the Spaniards harvest,
who well hoped to have had a monopoly o^ so wealthy a Region: and to have
enjoyed without any rival or competitor, the possession, (I cannot say the
love) of a country abundantly fruitful in Spices, Fruits, and such Creatures,
which the old world never knew: burdened with such store of kine and bulls, that
the Spaniards killed thousands of them yearly, for their tallow and hides
only: blessed with such abundance of gold, that the Spaniards found in their
mines more gold then earth; a metal which the Americans not regarding,
greedily exchanged for hammers, knives, axes, and the like tools of iron: For
before they were wont to make their Canes or boats plain without, and hollow
within by the force of fire. Other particularities shall be specified in the
particular delineation of every Country; now let us return again to our
discoueries of this great part of the world. Columbus having thus fortunately
begun this worthy enterprise was seconded by Americus Vespusius, a Florentine;
employed herein by Emanuell King of Portugal; who finding out the Continent or
maine Land of this Country, called it America. To him succeeded John Cabot, a
Venetian, the father of Sebastian Cabot, in the behalf of Henry the 7th of
England* and after these, diverse private undertakers and adventurers, out of
all nations of Europe, that border on the Ocean. Ferdinando Magellanus, was the
first that compass^d the world, and found out the South passage called Fretum
Magellanicum: him followed our Drake, and Candish; Frobisher, and Dauies,
attempted a discovery of the North-west passage: Willoughby, and Burroughes of
the North-east: So that (according to that elegant saying of Sir Francis Bacon
in his Advancement of Learning,) This great building the world, had never
through lights made in it, till those days: by which, and of all parts of
Learning, this of Navigation, and by consequence of Cosmographie, has in
latter times obtained an incredible proficiencie. For proof of which, I will
draw down a small History of Navigation, from its infancy, till this perfect
and complete growth. In the worlds beginning, men quietly lived at home,
neither greedy of foreign commodities, nor inquisitiue after their lives or
fortunes; and as the Poet has it Nondum caesa suis (peregrinum ut viseret
orbem)
Montibus, in liquidas pinus descenderat undas.
The Pine left not the hills whereon it stood,
To seek strange lands, or roue upon the flood.
But when the providence of God had instructed Noah how to build an Arc, for
the safety of him and his, from the universal Deluge; this Arc settling on the
mountains of Ararat, and there long time remaining; gave the Phoenicians, a
sea-people, a pattern, whereby they might make the waters passable. The
heathen writers which knew not Noah, attribute the invention of shipping to
diverse men: Strabo, to Minos King of Crete; Diodorus Siculus, to Neptune; who
was therefore called the god of the Sea: and Tibullus, to the City of Tire, a
most potent and flourishing Common^weal^h among the Phoenicians, saying, Prima
ratem ventis credere docta Tyros.
The Tyrians first did teach us how,
With a ships keele the seas to plow.
The Egyptians received this invention from the Tyrians, and added much unto
it. For whereas first the vessels were either made of an hollow tree, of sundry
bordes joined together, and covered with beasts skins, which kind of vessels
are still in use in America: the Phoenicians brought them to strength and
form; but the Egyptians added deckes unto them. This use of shipping was
taught the Greeks, by Danaus King of Egypt, when he fled from his brother
Rameses, Nave prunus ab Aegypto Danaus advenit (says Pliny) ante enim ratibus
navigabatur: where we may see the difference between navis, a ship; and ratis,
a barge, or open vessel; of which last sort were they, which waf^ed over the
Grecians to the siege of Troy. Of all the Grecians, the Cretans were this way
most industrious, which gave both occasion to Aristotle to call Crete the Lady
of the Sea; and to the Proverb, Cretensis nescit pelagus? The Carthaginians
being a Colonie of Tire, were perfect in this Art, and thereby much damaged the
Romans: till it happened that a tempest, separating a Quinqueremis, or Galley of
five oars, from the Carthaginian Fleet, cast it on the shore; of Italy,
whereby the Romans learning the Art of ship-wrights, quickly became masters of
the Sea. This chanced about the beginning of the first Punicke war. That
France, and Spain, learned this Art from the Phoenicians, is more then
probable: Marseiles in the one, and Cadiz in the other, being both Tyrian
Colonies. As for the Belgians, till the Romans taught it, there was no
shipping, Caesar himself affirming, that Ad eos mercatores minime co^meant.
And the seas twixt Britain, and France, were so ill furnished with vessels,
that Caesar's soldiers were compelled to make ships, for the transportation
of his Army; singulari militum studio, (they are his own words) circiter
sexcentas and d^odetriginta naves invenit. Having thus brought Navigation to
the height and extent it had in those days, I will look back again on the
inventours of particular vessels, and the tackling to them belonging. The
Phoenicians (as we have before said) invented open vessels; the Egyptians,
ships with deckes; they also invented the Galley of two banks on a side,
which vessels by length of time grew so large, that Ptolomie Philopater made
one, of no fewer then 50 banks of oars on one side, Large ships of burden
called Circera, we owe to the Cypriots; cockboats, or ski^fes, ( scaphas) to
the Illyrians; brigantines, ( celoces) to the Rhodians; and frigates or swift
barks ( Lembos) to the Cyrenians. As for the tacklings, the Boeotians invented
the oar; Daedalus, and his son Icarus, the masts and sails; which gave the
Poets occasion to faigne, that those two made wings to their bodies, and fled
out of Crete; and that Icarus soaring too high, melted his wings, and was
drowned: the truth indeed being, that presuming too far on his new
invention* he ran against a rock, and so perished: For hippagines,
ferrieboats, or vessels for the transporting of horse, we are indebted to the
Salaminians; for grappling-hookes to Anach^rsis; for Ancres, to the Tuscans;
and for the rudder, helm, stern, or Art of steering, to Typhis; who seeing
that a Kite when she flew, guided her whole body by her tail; effected that
in the devices of Art, which he had observed in the works of nature. The
greatest voyages which I have met withal in old stories, are those of Jason,
Ulysses, and Alexander, with the Fleetes of Solomon, and the Egyptian Kings.
Of these, Jason and his companions, sailed in the ship Argo, (whereof Typhis
aboue-mentioned was master) through the Euxine sea, and part of the
Mediterranean: Ulysses through the Mediterranean only, small gullets if compared
with the Ocean. Alexander's journey so famoused, and accounted so hazardous,
was but sailing down the river Ganges, and 400 furlongs into the Ocean: and for
the Fleets of Solomon, and the Kings of Egypt, it is very apparent that they
went with great leisure, and crawled close by the shore side; otherwise it had
bin impossible to have consumed 3 whole years, in going from Ezion Geber, into
India, and returning again, which was the usual time of these voyages, as
appears in the 1 of Kings, chap. 10, verse 22. After the fall of the Roman
Monarchy, the most potent states by sea in the Mediterranean, were the
Genowaies, and Venetians: in the Oce^n, the English, and the Hansetownes;
neither of which ever attempted any discoueries. About the year 1300, one
Flauio, of Melphi in the Realm of Naples, found out the Compass, or Pixis
Nautica, consisting of 8 winds only, the four principal, and four
collateral; and not long after, the people of Bruges and Antwerp^, perfected
that excellent invention; adding 24 other subordinate winds or points. By
means of this excellent instrument, and withal by the good success of
Columbus: the Portugals, Eastward; the Spaniards, Westward; and the English,
Northwards; have made many a glorious and fortunate expedition. And now I
return to my particular descriptions of America; only telling you by the way,
that the chief writers in Pilotisme, or the Art of Navigation, are Petrus de
Medina; Peter Nonius in his Regulae artis navigandi; and Johannes Aurigarius in
his Speculum Nauticum.

OF MEXICANA.
America is divided into two parts Mexicana. Peruana.


MEXICANA contains the Northern tract, and comprehends the distinct
Provinces of 1 Mexico, 2 Quivira, 3 Nicaragua, 4 Iucutan, 5 Florida, 6
Virginia, 7 Norumbega, 2 Nova Francia, 9 Corterialis, 10 Estotilandia.

MEXICO, giving name to hal^e America, is now called Nova Hispania; whence the
Kings of Spain use to style themselves, Hispaniarum Reges. In this Country is
that excellent tree, called Mete, which they plant and dress, as we do our
Vines. It has 40 kinds of leaves, which serve for many uses; for when they be
tender, they make of them conserues, paper, flax, mantles, mats, shoes,
girdles, and cordage. On these leaves grow certain prickles, so strong and
sharp, that they use them instead of sawes. From the root of this tree comes
a juice like unto sirrop, which if you seethe it will become honey; if you
purify it, will become sugar: you may also make wine and vinegar of it. The
rind roasted, heals hurts and sores; and from the top-boughes, issues a
gum, which is an excellent antidote against poi^on.

It abounds with golden-sanded rivers, in which are many Crocodiles, (though
not so big as the Crocodiles of Egypt) which the people eat: it is very much
furnished with Goldemines. and glories in the mountain Pr^pochampathe, which
is of the same nature with Aetna, and Vesuvius. The limits of it are on the
East, Incutan, and the gulf of Mexico; on the West, Calformio or Mar
Vermiglio; on the South, Peruana: the Northern bounds are unknown: so that we
cannot certainly avow this America to be Continent; nor certainly affirm it
to be an Island, distinguished from the old world. It was very populous before
the arrival of the Spaniards, who in 17 years slew 6 millions of them;
rosting some, plucking out the eyes; cutting off the arms of others; and
casting them living to be devoured of wild beasts. It is divided into four
parts, viz: Noua Gallicia, 2 Mechuachan, 3 Guastachan, 4 Tremistitan.

1 Gallicia Nova is watered with the rivers Piastla, and S. Sebastian. The
principal Cities are 1 Xalisco, taken by Nonnio Gusmano, 1530, 2 Guadalaiara.
3 Capal^, now New Mexico. 4 Coanum, where the men are content with one wife,
which is here a miracle. 5 Compostella: and 6 S. Esprit: all which were built
by Nugno Gusman, after by taking of Xalisco he had mastred all the Province.
The people hereof, that live upon the shore, seed most on fish: they of the
inland parts, on flesh, which they take in hunting. They go for the most part
naked; and before the coming of the Spaniards, acknowledged no lord, but lived
in a common liberty. That Country which lies between the two rivers of
Piastle, and S. Sebastian abouementioned, is by a peculiar name called
Couliacan; stony it is, and rough, as the rest of Nova Gallicia; yet yielding
mines of Gold in good plenty. The chief Town is S. Michael, where is a
Colonie of Spaniards. 2 Mechu^can contains in circuit 80 leagues. It is one
of the best countries of New Spain, abounding in mulberry trees, silk, honey,
wax, black amber, and such store of fish, that from them it took its name;
Mechuoucan signifying a place of fishing. The men are tall, strong, and active;
and speak a most elegant and copious language, and seem to be of a very good
wit. The chief towns are 1 Sinsonse, the residence of the old Kings of this
Country. 2 Pascuar. 3 Colima. 4 Valadolit a Bishops See. The principal havens
are S. Anthonies, and S. James, or S. Iago. 3 Gnastacan, is most poor in the
natural commodities of the soil: but rich in the more civil life of the
inhabitants. The chief City is Tlascalan, the chief city of all these parts
next unto Mexico, unto whom only it yields precedencie. It is seated in the
pleasantest part of all the country; rich it is, populous, and governed after
the form of a Commonwealth, under the protection of the King of Spain. 2
Villeriche, a port-towne, very wealthy, because all the traffic, betwixt the
old and new Spaines, does pass through it. The Spaniards have in it two
Colonies, viz: Pamico, and S. James in the valleys. 4 Tremistatan or Mexico,
is the greatest and noblest of these four: in it are the cities 1 Villarucca,
2 Antichero, 3 Meccioca, 4 O^topan, 5 Mexico, the seat of an Archbishop, and of
the Spanish Viceroy; whose power is to make Laws and Ordinances, to give
directions, and determine controversies, unless it be in such great causes,
which are thought fit to be referred ^0 the Council of Spain. This City is
situate on the Lakes and Islands like Venice, euery-where interlaced with the
pleasant currents of fresh, and sea waters; and carrying a face of more civil
government then any of America; though nothing, if compared with Europe. The
plain wherein the Town stands, is said to be 70 leagues in compass,
environed with high hills, on the tops of which, snow lies continually. The
Lake on whose bank it stands, is 50 miles in compass; all along whose
banks stand pleasant Towns, and diverse houses; on which Lake also, 50000
wherries are continually plying. Mexico is in compass 6 miles, and contains
6000 houses of Spaniards, and 60000 of Indians. It is a byword, that at Mexico
there are four fair things, viz: the women, the apparel, the horse^, and the
streets. Here is also a printing house, an University, and a Mint.
Nigh to this City is the gulf of Mexico, whose current is so swift and
heady, that ships cannot pass directly to and fro, but are compelled to bear
either much North, or much South. It is 900 miles in compass; and has two
ports, one between the farthest part of Iucutan, and the I Will of Cuba, at which
the tide with a violent stream enters: the other between the said Cuba, and
the farthest point of Florida, at which the tide with like violence goes
forth. The Sea is very tempestuous, and has only two safe ports, viz: Havana
on the North side: and 2 St John de Lua, strongly fortified by the Spaniards,
on the South.

The people of Mexico, or Tremistitan, are witty and industrious, full of
courage and valor; good handicraftsmen if they give their minds to it, and
rich merchants, such as so apply themselves. In their wars they used slings
and arrows: and since the coming of the Spaniards among them, the harcubuise.
Their kings succeeded not by right of blood, but by election; and were commonly
active, lusty, and fit for war; the people holding it lawful to kill their
kings, if they were reputed cowards. They had among them an order of Knights
instituted by the last king, which were licensed to wear gold and silver, to
be clothed in Cotton, and to wear breeches; all which were prohibited the
vulgar.

This Country is inferior to Peru in the plenty and purity of gold and
silver, but far exceeding it both in the mechanical and ingenious arts here
professed; and in the abundance of fruits and cattle: of which last here is
such store, that many a private man has 40000 kine and oxen to himself. Fish
is here also in great plenty, that only which is drawn out of the lake whereon
Mexico stands, being reputed worth 20000 Crowns.

The Mexicans first were the inhabitants of Nova Gallicia, whence they made a
violent irruption, as is coniectured, Anno 720. They lingered in diverse places,
till the year 902, when under the leading of Mexi their Captain, they built
this City, and called it after the name of their General. They were in all, 7
Tribes; which ruled long in an Aristocraticall state, till the most puissant of
the Tribes called Nauatalcas, elected a king to whom they submitted themselves.

The Kings of Mexico.
1 Vitzilovitli. 2 Acamopitzli. 3 Chimalpapoca. 4 Izchoalt. 5 Motecumo. 1 6
Acacis. 7 Axaica. 8 Antzlol. 9 Motecumo II. 10 Quabutimoc.
The most fortunate of these Kings was Izchoalt, who by his Cosen Tlacaellec,
subdued the other 6 Tribes, and brought them under the Mexican Kings. After the
death of Izchoalt, Tlacaellec was by the Electours (which are six in number)
chosen K. as a man of whose virtue they had formerly made trial. But he very
nobly refused it, saying, that it was more convenient for the commonwealth,
that another should be king, and that he should execute that which was for the
necessity of the state, the^ to lay the whole burden upon his back: and that
without being king, he would not leave to labor for the public, as well as if
he were. Upon this generous refusal, they made choice of Motecumo the first.
The most unhappy, at whose birth could not but be some disastrous aspect of the
Planets, were the two last: who were both vanquished by Fernando Cortez and
Mexico was made subject to Spain, Anno. 1521. The army which Cortez led with
him, to conquer this so puissant and flourishing estate, consisted of 100000
Indians, or Americans, 900 Spaniards only, 80 horse, 17 pieces of small
ordnance, 13 brig^ndines, and 6000 wherry-boats, which he employed in infesting
Mexico from the lake above mentioned. Most of these 100000 Indians were of the
City and territory of Tlascalan, who never held good side with the Mexicans:
for which cause that city enjoys many immunities to this day.

QVIVIRA is seated on the most Western part of America, just over against
Tartary, from whence being not much distant, it is supposed that the
inhabitants first came into this new world. It is full of herbage, and enjoys
a temperat air: the people are desirous of Glass more then of Gold; and in
some places are Caniballs. The chief riches of this Country, are their kine,
which are to this people, as we say with us of our Ale to drunkards; meat,
drink, and cloth, and more too. For their hides yield them houses, or at
least the couerings of them; their bone, bodkinnes; their hair, thread; their
sinews, ropes; their horns, mawes, and bladders, vessels; their dung, fire;
their Calues-skinnes, budgets to draw and keep water; their blood drink;
their flesh, meat. There is thought to be some traffic from China or Cathay
hither: For when Vasques di Coronado conquered it, he saw in the further sea
certain ships, not of common making, which seemed to be well laden; and bare
in their prowes, Pellicans: which could not be co^iectured to come from any
Country, but one of these two. Having now said thus much concerning Quiuira in
general, it is time we should proceed to her Provinces, which are Cibola, and
Noua Albion.

Cibola, lies on the East side, and takes its name from the chief City: the
next to which is Totontoa, situate on a river so called. 3 Tinguez burnt by the
Spaniard, who under the conduct of Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, made this
Province subject to their King, Anno 1540.

Noua Albion lies on the West side, toward Tartary. It was discovered by that
Noble Captain, Sr Francis Drake, A. 1585 and by him called Noua Albion:
because the King did willingly submit himself to our Queen. The Country is
abundant in fruit, pleasing both the eye and the pallat; the people are given
to hospitality, but withal to witchcraft, and adoration of devils. The chief
City is called after the name of the Province. Here is a Hare resembling a
Want in his feet, and a Cat in his tail; under whose chinne nature has
fastened a little bag, which she has also taught him to use as a storehouse;
for in this, having filled his belly, preserves the remnant of his provision.
The bound between this Quivira, and Mexicana^, is Mar Vermiglio, or Califormio.

NICARAGVA is Southeast from Mexico, with whom it agrees in nature, both of
soil, and inhabitants. For the people are of good stature, and of color
indifferent white. They had before they received Christianity, a settled and
politic form of government: only as Solon appointed no law for a man's killing
of his father, so had this people none for the killer of a king both of them
conceiting, that men were not so unnatural as to commit such crimes. A thief
they judged not to death, but adjudged him to be slave to that man whom he had
robbed, till by his service he had made satisfaction: a course more merciful,
and not less just, then the loss of life. The Country is so pleasing to the
eye, and abounding in all things necessary, that the Spaniards call it Mahomets
paradise; and among other flourishing trees, here grows one of that nature,
that a man cannot touch any of their branches, but it withers presently. It
is as plentiful of Parrets, as England is of Crows; and has a lake 300 miles
in compass, which having no intercourse with the Ocean, does yet ebb and
flow continually. The chief Cities are 1 New Granado. 2 Leo a Bishops See.

IVCVTAN, was first manifested to the Europaeans, by Francisco Hernandes di
Cordoua, Anno 1517. It was called Iucutan not as some conceit it, from Ioctan
the son of Heber, who they think came out of the East, where the Scripture
places him, (Genesis 10.30) to inhabit here: but from Iucutan, which in the
American tongue, is, what say you. For when the Spaniards at their first
coming hither, asked the name of the place; the Savages not understanding what
they meant, replied Iucutan, that is, what say you: whereupon the Spaniards
always after called it by this name. The Country is 900 miles in circuit, and
is a Peninsula. This Country is very fresh and plentiful, but especially about
Guatimala. It is situate over against the I Will Cuba, and is divided into three
parts: I, Iucutan, whose Cities of greatest worth, are Campechium, Sidalancum;
and one, which for its greatness and beauty, they call Caire. II, Guatimala,
whose inhabitants have lost half a million of their kinsmen and friends, by
the unmerciful dealing of the Spaniards: The chief Towns are Guatimala,
Cassuca, and Giapa. III, Acasamill, an Island over against Guatimala, vulgarly
called Santa Cruza, or Insula S. Crncis. The chief town is Santa Cruza.

FLORIDA has on the East Mare del Norte; on the West, Mexico; on the North,
Noua Francia; and on the south, Virginia. It was discovered by the English,
under the guiding of Sebastian Cabot, Anno 1497. Afterward it was possessed by
John Ponce, a Spaniard, 1527; who called it Florida, because he came first to
it on Easter day, which the Spaniards call Pascha Florida; or else quia Florida
erat regio, because it was a flourishing Country. For indeed the Country
abounds with goodly fruits, and has good quantity of gold and silver:
Emeralds are also found here, and so are Turquosies and Pearls. The men of
this country do naturally love war and revenge, insomuch that they are
continually in war with one or other. They are crafty also and very
intelligent, as appears by the answer they gave to Ferdinando Soto, a
Spaniard, who was here among them Ao 1549. For when he went to persuade the
people that he was the son of God, and came to teach them the law: not so,
replied a Floridan, for God never bad thee to kill and slaie thus, and work
all kind of mischief amongst us. The women when their husbands are dead, use
to cut off their hair close to their ears, and strew it on his sepulcher: and
cannot marry again, till their hair be grown long enough to cover their
shoulders. Hermaphrodites are here also in great plenty, whom they use as
beasts to carry their luggage, and put them to all kind of drudgery. They have
all a gross belief of the souls immortality, but are otherwise idolaters.
After the discovery of Ponce, this Country fell next into the possession of
John Ribaulte and the French, Anno 1562: but the Spaniards unwilling to let the
French be eyewitnesses of their rich booty, waged war with them so long;
that there was not a man left on either side to maintain the quarrel: and
Florida was again abandoned, Ao 1567. The principal Cities are 1 Arx
Carolina built by the French and ruined by the enemy: 2 S. Helens. 3 S.
Mathewes, built by the Spaniard. Here are also three strong forts holden by the
Spaniards, and well garrisond, viz. S. James, S. Philip, and S. Augustine;
which last was taken and burnt by Sr Fraenis Drake, Ao 1586, and is again
repaired. These three forts are all which the King of Spain has in this
Country, so that it seems he is not so desirous to plant it himself, as to
hinder others from doing it.

VIRGINIA called by the natives Apalchen, has on the East, Mare del Noort; on
the West, we yet know not what limit; on the North Norumbega; and on the
South, Florida. It is so fruitful, that two acres of land will return 400
bushells of corn. There is said to be rich veins of Alum, Pitch, Tar, Rozen,
Turpentine, store of Cedar, Grapes, Oil, plenty of sweet Gummes, dies, timber
trees, mines of iron and copper; and abundance of fruit, Fishes, Beasts, Foul,
and that herb or grain which they call Maize.

The people are of indifferent stature; they use to paint their bodies with the
pictures of Serpents, and other ugly beasts; and are clothed in a loose mantle
made of Deeres skin, and wear an apron of the same before their nakedness.
They worship all things, and them only, which are able to hurt them, as fire,
water, lightning, thunder, etc.

There is but one entrance into this Country by Sea, which is at the mouth of a
very goodly bay: the Capes on both sides, being called Cape Henry, and Cape
Charles, are after in some sort fortefied. It is watered with the rivers
Quibequesson, and Apanawapeske. The chief Towns are 1 Kequoughton, 2 James
Town. 3 Dalefeguift. It was discovered by the English at the directions and
charges of Sr Walter Rawleigh, Anno 1584, and in honor of our Virgin Queen,
was called Virginia. The English have diverse times gone thither to inhabit;
some not liking the Country returned homewards, others abided there still, and
were not long since in number about 800 men, women, and children: but now the
number is much diminished, the barbarous people having in the year 1622,
slain treacherously about 300 of them. The Northern part of this Virginia,
being better discovered then the other, is called NEW ENGLAND full of good new
Towns and sorts, and is likely to prove an happy plantation.

NORVMBEGA, has on the North, Nova Francia; on the South Virginia. The air is
of a good temper; the soil fruitful; and the people indifferently civil: all
of them, as well me^ as women, painting their faces. The men are much affected
to hunting, and therefore never give their daughters to any, unless he be well
skilled in that game also. The women are here very chaste, and so well love
their husbands, that if at any time they chance to be slain, the widows will
neither marry, nor eat flesh, till the death of their husbands be revenged.
They both dance much, and for more nimblenesse sometimes stark naked. The
chief Town is called Norumbega, and is possessed by the French.

NOVA FRANCIA has on the North, Terra Corterialis; on the South, Norumbega.
The earth is barren, the people barbarous. It was discovered by Jacques Cartier,
of France, Anno 1534: and is inhabited besides the natives, with some few
Frenchmen. The chief Towns are Canada. 2 Sanguinai, seated on rivers so
called. And 3 Hochelaga, a town round in shape, and compassed about with three
course of timber rampires, one within the other, sharp at the top, and two rods
high. It has about 50 great houses, and but one gate, which is shut with piles
and bars. The people believe that when they dye they go unto the Stars;
vnd that from thence they are conveied into certain green fields, adorned with
trees, flowers, etc. The common people which inhabit not the Towns abouenamed,
dwell in their boats, which they turn vpside down, and lie under them.

TERRA CORTERIALIS, or Di Laboredora, has on the North, Estotiland; on the
South, the river Canada. This great river arises out of the hill called
Hombuedo, his whole course is 900 miles long, 800 mile nauigable: at his
aestuarium 105 miles in breadth. It is called also the river of the three
brothers, and by some the river of S. Laurence. It takes name from Gaspar
Corterialis, a Portugal, who first discovered it, Ao 1500. The men are
barbarous, of color brown, swift of foot, clothed in beasts skins, and are
very good archers. They live in Caves, or base Cottages, adorn themselves with
silver and brass bracelets, and generally feed on fish. The chief of their
Villages are 1 Breast. 2 Cabo Marzo. and 3 Santa Maria.

ESTOTILAND has on the South Terra Corterialis; and on the North, the
Streights called Fretum Davisij, from John Davis an Englishman: who endeavored
to find out a more commodious and quick passage to Cathaia and China, than
was yet discovered, by the North of America: which design of his he began
luckily, but accomplished it not with the like prosperous event. Yet was not he
the first that ever attempted this passage, Sebastian Cabot giving the first
ouset, Anno 1497; and Sr Martin Frobisher seconding his beginnings, 1576. He
made in all three several voyages, brought with him some of the natives, and a
great deal of Ore, which being in England tried, did scarce quit the cost: a
great promontory hereof he called Queen Elizabeth's foreland, and the Sea
running by it Frobishers straights. On the other side of these straights, lies
Groenland; and not far distant Freizland: one of whose kings by name Zichmi,
employed Nicholas and Antonio Zeni, two brothers, to discover the adjacent
Countries. This they undertook with a noble resolution, and performed with as
much care; discovering the shore of this Country, and then returned, Anno 1390.
The soil is sufficiently enriched with natural endowments: the inhabitants
also are endued with a greater readiness of wit, and soundness of judgment,
that the other Americans. This Province is called by us English, New found
land; and was rediscouered by some of our Captains, 1527; who imposed most of
their names, which are yet retained. The Seas about this Country abound with
fish, insomuch that in 4 hours, 2 or 300 of them are commonly taken. They are
hence conveyed into all parts of Europe, and vented by the name of New found
land fish. The natives use also to fish, and venture on the great Ocean in
little boats made of leather: which, when their fish is caught, they carry home
under their arms.

Thus much of Mexicana.

OF PERVANA.
PERVANA contains the Southern part of America, and is tied to Mexicana, by
the Istmus or straight of Darien being no more then 17 miles broad; others make
it 12 only. Certain it is, that many have motioned to the Counsel of Spain,
the cutting of a nauigable channel through this small Istmus, so to shorten
the common voyages to China and the Moluccoes. But the Kings of Spain have not
hitherto attempted it, partly because if he should employ the Americans in the
work, he should loose those few of them, which his people have suffered to
live: partly because the slaves, which they yearly buy out of Africa, do but
suffice for the mines and sugar-houses: but principally, least the passage by
the Cape of good hope, being left off; those seas might become a receptacle of
Pirates. I have read of many the like attempts begun, but never of any
finished. Sesostris king of Egypt, Darius of Persia, one of the Ptolomies, and
a late capricious Portugal, had the like plot, to make a passage from the red
Sea, to the Mediterranean: so had Caesar, Caligula, and Nero, Emperors of
Rome, upon the Corinthian Istmus: another of the same nature had Charles the
great, to let the Rhene into the Danowe: the like Lucius Verus, to join the
Rhene and the Rhone; all which in their peculiar places we have already
touched. Nicanor also king of Syria, intended to have made a channel, from the
Caspian to the Euxine Sea; an infinite project: but neither he nor any of the
rest could finish these works; God, it seems, being not pleased at such
proud and haughty enterprises; and yet perhaps, the want of treasure has not
been the least cause, why the like proiects have not proceeded: besides the
dreadful noyses and apparitions, which (as we have already said) continually
affrighted the workmen.

The compass of this part of America, is 17000, of the other, 13000 miles: It
comprehends 1 Castella Aurea. 2 Guiana. 3 Peru. 4 Brasile, 5 Chile.

CASTELLA AVREA, so called for the abundance of gold; contains the Northern
part of Peruana, and part of the Istmus. It is admirably stored with Silver,
Spices, Pearls, and medicinal herbs: and is divided into four Provinces,
viz: 1 Castella del Or.o 2 Nona Andaluzia. 3 Noua Granata. 4 Cartagena.

Castella del Oro situate in the very Istmus, is not very populous, by reason
of the vnhealthfulnesse of the air, and noisome savor of the standing pooles.
The chief Cities are 1 Theonyma, or Nombre di dios, on the East; and Panama,
on the west side. They were both built by Didacus Niquesa; and the first had
this name, because Niquesa having been crossed with many dismal chances, and
misaduentures; when he came hither, bad his men now go on shore, en nombre di
dios, in the name of god. The air in the place where he built them, being very
vnhealththie; the King of Spain, Ao 1584, commanded that they should be
plucked, both of them, down, and rebuilt in a more convenient place: which was
performed by Peter Aria. Through these two Towns, comes all the traffic
that is between Spain and Peru, for whatsoever commodity comes out of Peru
is unladen at Panama, carried by land to Nombre di dios, and there shipped to
Spain: and vice versa.

I should wrong my Country, in concealing the worth of her people, Camden
if I omitted the attempt of John Oxenham, one of Sr Francis Drakes followers,
on this place. This man arriving with 70 companions, a little above these
towns, drew a land his ship, covered it with boughs, and marched over the
land with his company guided by Negroes, until he came to a river where he cut
down wood, made him a pinnase, entered the South Sea, went to the I Will of
Pearls, lay there 10 days, intercepted in two Spanish ships, 60000 pound
weight in gold, 100000 pound weight in bars of silver, and returned safely
again to the maine land. And though through the mutiny of his company, he
neither returned to his country, nor his hidden ship; yet is it an adventure
not to be forgotten, in that never by any other attempted, and by the Spanish
writers, with much admiration, recorded.

Andaluzia Noua has on the North, Castella del Oro; on the South Peru. The
best Cities are Tocoio, now S. Margarets, and 2 Santa Espritta.

Noua Granada is situate on the south side of Carthagena: The chief Cities
are Tungia, directly under the Equator 2 Tochaimum. 3 Popaian, built by one
Sebastian Belalzar, who first subdued this Country. 4 S. Foye an Archbishops
seat, and a Court of Justice. 5 Palma. and 6 Merida, called after this name
from Merida in Spain. This Country is very strong, by reason of its situation
among stony rocks which enuiron it and through which there are very narrow
passages: yet is it full of pleasing valleys which yield much fruit; and has
in it some mines of gold and silver.

Cartagena has a fruitful soil, in which grows a tree, which if any one
touch he will hardly escape a poisoning. The chief Cities are Cartagena
(called by the natives Calamur) which Sr Francis Drake surprised, 1585; and
besides inestimable sums of wealth, took with him from hence 240 pieces of
Ordnance. 2 Abuida. 3 S. Martha on the river d' Abuida (called also S. John's,
and Rio di Grand) 4 Venezuela. 5 New Cales. These three last regions are called
Terra Firma, and are the Basis of this reuersed Pyramid.

GVIANA has on the East, and South, the river Maragnon called also Amazone,
and Orellana; on the West, the mountains of Peru; and on the North, the great
river Orenoque, or Raliana. This river is nauigable with ships of burden 1000
miles, but with Boats and Pinnases almost 2000 miles; and borrows his latter
name from S. Walter Raleigh, who first of all, to any purpose, made a plenary
survey of this Country, her commodities, and situation, Anno 1595. The river
Maragnon, called Amazone, from the Amazons, which are fabled to live here; and
Crellana, from one so called, who first (Anno 1543) sailed in it, is nauigable
almost 6000 miles, and broad toward the Sea 200 miles.

This country is directly situate under the Aequinoctiall line, and is the
fruitfullest part of Peruana. The inhabitants in winter time dwell in trees for
fear of inundations, making on them many artificial Villages, and ranges of
building. The like habitations they also have in Brasil, and in Golden Castile:
in which last Country, we find Abibeiba the King hereof, to have had his
palace on a tree; from which Francisco Vasques, a Spanish Captain, could by
no Rhetoric entreat him to descend, till he began to cut down the tree, and
then the poor Prince came down, and bought his life at the Spaniards price.
The old Iucolae were the Caribes; the present are the Samai, the Assawi, and
the Wikeri, nations of Peru: which, when as Francisco Pizarro had subdued that
Realm, fled hither; and driving out the Caribes, planted themselves here.

When this Country was first opened, and the riches of it plainly manifested,
suit was made that some English forces might be sent thither, and a Colonie
erected. Which motion, on mature consultation, was at last concluded to be
prejudicial to the state; because of the distance of our body of war. 2ly
Because that the Spanish Armies and Colonies bordering every way on it, might
cast out our small strength^, and make the expedition dishonorable.

The chief Towns are, Morequito, a safe harbor, 2 Winicapora, nigh unto
which, report tell^th us of a Crystal mountain. 3 Manao, called also El
Dorodo, the greatest C^tty of America; and as some relate, of the world too.
For Deigo Ordas one of the companions of Cortez, is said to have entered into
this City at noone, and to have traveled all that day, and the next also,
until night, through the streets hereof* before he came to the Kings Palace.
It is situate on a lake of salt water, 200 leagues in length; and is by the
Spaniards called El Dorada (or the gilded City) from the abundance of Gold
both in Coin, Plate, Armor, and other furniture, which the said Deigo Ordas
there saw. And 4 St Thome a Town patched up of sticks and dirt, the bane of
destruction to that unfortunate Gentleman Sr Walter Rawleigh, Anno 1617: of
whom I will say with Mr Camden in his Annalls; Vir erat, nunquam satis laudato
studio, and regiones remotas detegendi, and naualem Angliae gloriam promouendi.

PERV has on the East, the Peruvian mountains; on the west Mare Pacificum, or
Del Zur; on the North, Castella Aurea, and the river Peru from which, the name
of all the Country is to be derived; and on the South, Chile.

The soil is luxuriant in all manner of grain; fortunate, in the civility of
her inhabitants, frequency of Cities, and salubrity of air. Here is also
great store of Tobacco, which though in some respect, being moderately taken,
may be serviceable for Physic: yet (besides the consumption of the purse, and
impairing of our inward parts) the immoderate, vain, and fantastical abuse
of this hellish weed, corrupts the natural sweetness of the breath,
stupefieth the brain, and indeed is so prejudicial to the general esteem of
our Country men, that one says of them, Anglorum corpora qui huic plantae
tantopere indulgent, in Barbarorum naturam degenerasse videntur. The two chief
virtues ascribed to it are, that it is good against Lues ven^rea, that
loathsome disease, the pox; and that it voideth rhewme. For the first, like
enough it is that similes habent labra lactucas, so unclean a disease may be
fitted with so unwholesome a medicine. For the second good quality attributed
unto it, I think it rather to consist in opinion then truth; the rhewme which
it voideth, being only that which it self ingendreth. We may as well conclude
that bottle-ale breaks wind, for that effect we find to follow the drinking
of it, though indeed it is only the same wind which it self conue^ed into
the stomach. But Tobacco is by few taken now as medicinal: it is grown a
good fellow, and fallen from a Physicion to a complement. A folly which
certainly had never spread so far, if here had been the same means of
prevention used with us, as lately was in Turkey, by Morat Bassa: who commanded
a pipe to be thrust through the nose of a Turk, which was found taking
Tobacco: and so in derision, to be led about Constantinople. This unsavory drug
was first brought hither, by the Mariners of Sr Francis Drake, Ano 1585; It
may be as an antidote for the immoderat use of drinking, which our B^lgian
Soldiers brought with them, 3 years before, from the Low countries: before
which time, of all Northern people, the English were deemed most free from
that swinish vice; wherein it is to be feared, they have now out-gon their
teachers, the Dutch.

The people hold opinion, that men use after their burial, to ^at, drink, and
wantonnize with women: and therefore commonly at the death of any, they kill
some of his servants (whom they bury with him) to wait on him in the other
world. They are ignorant of letters, yet are they of a good courage in the
wars, fear not death, and know well how to manage their weapons. When they
have conquered any Country, they use to divide it into three parts; allotting
the first, to the service of their Gods; the second to the revenue of their
King; and the third to the maintenance and relief of the poor: a very just
and equal division

This Province above any other in America, is abundant in Gold and Silver; the
mines whereof in diverse places, yield more of these mettles, then of earth: by
which abundance, not Spain only, but all Europe also, is more stored with pure
and fine coin, then ever formerly it was. Our ancestors the Britains, used
brass rings, and iron rings, for their instruments of exchange, The most
usual material of money among the Roman Provinces, was seldom gold or silver,
most times brass, sometimes leather: Corium forma publica percussum, as Seneca
has it. This last kind of money, was by Frederick the second made current when
he besieged Millaine; the like is said to have been used here in England, at
the time of the Barrons wars: and why not? Since no longer ago, then in the
year 1574, the Hollanders then being in their extremities, made money of
past-board. But this happens only in cases of necessity; the two metals of
gold and silver, having for many hundred years, though not in such abundance,
been the principal instrument of exchange, and bartery; and so questionless
will continue to the end of the world. Sr Thomas Moore, in the second book of
his Vtopia, prefers iron before these metals, Vt sine quo, non magis quam
sine ^gne, atque aqua, vi^ere mortales queant. He gives us there also a plot
to bring gold and silver into contempt: telling us, how the Vtopians employ
those metals, in making of chamberpots, and vessels of more unclean use;
eating and drinking for the most part, in glass or earth: how they make
fette^s and chains herewith to hold in their rebellious slaves and
malefactors: how they punish infamous persons, by putting gold rings on their
fingers, jewels in their ears, and chains of gold about their necks: and how
they adorn their infants and little children with jewels and precious stones;
which gayeties, when they come to any age, and observe how none but children
use them; they cast away of their own accord, as with us our elder ones leave
off without constraint their babies, cobnuts, and other crepundia* He tells
us further how the Ambassadors of the Anemolij, a confederate state of the
Vtopians, coming amongst them richly and gorgeously attired, were taken for
slaves, by reason of their gold chains; and the basest of the train, deemed
to be the Ambassadors: how the elder boys derided the strangers for wearing
jewels, as if they had been children still: and how the people laughed at their
chains of gold, as being too slight and slenders, to hold in, or shackle such
big fellows. Now says he, the reason why they had any gold or silver at al
among them, was not for any esteem they had of it, but to hire and wage
foreign soldiers withal, when the necessities of their state required it.
How this device would sort with the people, which Lucian fableth to be in the
Moon. I know not, though perhaps it might fit them well enough. But I am sure
in this s^blunary world, it is never like to take: And so I leave it, telling
you that it is by many thought that this extraordinary plenty of gold and
silver, since the discovery of these countries, is the cause of the dearth of
al things in respect of former times: for where much is, much may be given: yet
there want not some that add also other causes, of the high prizes of our
days: viz: monopolies; combinations of merchants and craftsmen; transportation
of grain; pleasure of great personages; the excess of private men, and the
like: but these last I rather take to be concauses, the first being indeed the
principal. For, (as that excellent Sr Henry Sauill, has it in the end of his
notes on Tacitus) the excessive abundance of (...), things which consist
merely on the constitution of men; draws necessarily (...)* those things
which nature requires to an higher rate in the market; Capta ab Augusto
Alexandria (says Orosius) Roma in tantum ^pibus eius creuit, vt duplo maiora
quam antebac, rerum venalium pr^tia statuerentur. As for that question, whether
of the two kingdoms be happier, that which supplieth it self with money, by
traffic and the works of art; or that which is supplied by mines in it
growing, as the gift of nature: I find it by this tale in part resolved. Two
Merchants departing from Spain to get gold, touched upon part of Barbary;
where the one buyeth Moors to dig and delue with; the other fraughteth his
vessel with sheep: and being come to the Indies the one finding mines, set his
slaves to work; and the other happening on grassie grounds, put his sheep to
grasing. The slaves grow cold and hungry, call for food and clothing; which
the sheep-master by the increase of his cattle, had in abundance: so that what
the one got in gold, with toil, charges, and hazard; he gladly gave unto the
other for continual supplies of victuals and rayments, for himself and his
servants. In the end, the mines being exhausted, and all the gold thence
arising being exchanged with the sheepheards, for such necessaries as nature
required: home returns the Shepherd in triumph, his companion having
nothing to show for the improuement of his stock. But I dare not determine a
question so weighty, only I will tell you that the Hollanders and English, by
the benefit of traffic and merchandise only, wearied the late king of Spain^
and out-vied him as it were in strength and treasury: notwithstanding his
mines in Spain, Italy, Barbary, India, Mexicana, and these of Peru; which we
now handle, and which gave occasion to this discourse.

The chief Cities of Peru, are 1 St Michaels, the first Colonie which the
Spaniards placed in these parts. 2 Arequipa, seated on the river of Plata, and
is the haven Town to Cusco. 3 Lima distant about two leagues from the Sea; the
port which serves it, being called Collao. It is built with much art, for all
the chief streets answer to the market place: and there is scarce any private
house which has not water conveyed to it from the river. It is an Archbishops
See, and residence of the Peruvian Vice Roy. 4 Cusco the seat of the ancient
Kings of this nation: Who the more to beautify this City, commanded every one
of the Nobility, to build a palace here, ^or his continual residence. It has
a ^aire market place, in the midst of which two high ways thwart one another,
which are 2000 miles long; straight and level, and which run cross the
Country. 5 Gaiachu. 6 Portoueio, where in digging graves, the Sextons happen
many times on the teeth of men, being 3 fingers broad. 7 Tomobamba glory^ng in
her fair pall^ces. And 8 Caxamalca.

The chief rivers are 1 Maragnon. 2 Guaiachil. 3 Rio di la Plate, being 150
miles broad at the mouth, and 2000 long, or there-abouts. Here is in this
country a beast, which has about her neck a bag of indifferent greatness;
into which she puts her yonglings at the approach of any body, and scuddeth
away. And here is also said to be a fig tree, of the which the North part which
looks toward the mountains, brings forth fruit in the Summer only: the
South part which looks toward the Sea, is fruitful only in the winter.

The Peruvians have thus much notice of the general Deluge, that the Country
was ouer-whelmed with waters, and all men perished except seven; who hid
themselves in a hole, which they cell Paticambo: where having lived in safety
till the fury of the waters were assuaged, they came out of their
lu^king-place, and re-peopled the Country. The chief of these seven was
Mangocapa; whose posterity possessing in this Country a plot of ground 20 miles
in circuit, governed themselves in an Aristocraticall state: and at last chose
them a King; which mutation of their Commonwealth, was (as by their
computation is coniectured) Anno 1280, or somewhat nigh it.

The Kings of Peru.
1 Ingarcia. 2 Vanguazagnaque. 3 Vixococa. 4 Pacachuti. 5 Guaimacapa. 8
Guascar, 8 Atabaliba. 7 Mangocapa 8 Amare.
The most luckie Prince of these 8, was Guaimacapa; who extended his Empire to
the largeness it now has. Since his death, fortune has frowned on them all.
For his two sons Guascar, and Atabalipa, immediately after the solemnizing of
his funeral, striued for the Empire, till Francisco Pizarro, a Spanish
Captain, ended the controversy; by seasing on the kingdom, to the use of his
master of Spain. Guascar was slain, and Atabalipa seeing the whole kingdom
lay at stake, laid all his riches, life, and liberty against it; and cast the
Dice on a plain, nigh to the City Caximalos, where the Dice running on the
Sp^niards sides, gave them the glory of the day, and hapless Atabalipa
remained a prisoner after an infinite slaughter of his subjects. He gave unto
the Spaniards as a ransom for his life, and liberty; a house piled up on all
sides, with refined Gold and silver, being in estimation about 10 millions:
which when they had received, they most perfidiously slew him. His two
successors labored the restoring of their ruinated inheritance, but prevailed
nothing: For the wickedness of the Peruvian was now full, and God sent these
Spaniards amongst them, as executioners of his vengeance, Anno 1533. This
Pizarro who subdued this most potent and flourishing kingdom, and made it a
member of the Spanish Empire, was borne at Trusiglio, a village of Navarre, and
by the poor whore his mother, laid in the Church porch, and so left to Gods
providence: by whose direction, (there being none found that would give him the
breast) he was nourished for certain days, by sucking a Sow. At last, one
Gonsalles, a soldier, acknowledged him for his son, put him to nurse, and
when he was somewhat grown, set him to keep his swine: some of which being
strayed, the boy durst not for fear return home, but betook himself to his
heels, ran unto Sevill, and there shipped himself for America; where he so
prospered, that he was by the King of Spain honored for his good service,
with the title of Marquess Anatillo, Anno 1535. The strange fortunes of this
man, call into my mind the like of Sinan, a great Bassa in the court of
Selimus the first; who being borne of base parentage, as he being a child was
sleeping in the shade, had his genitals bitten off by a Sow. The Turkish
Officers which usually provided young boys for the service of the Grand
Signeur, being in Epyrus, (for that was Sinans country) and hearing of this so
extraordinary an Eunuch, took him among others, along with them to the Court:
where under Mahomet the great, Baiaz^t the second, and his son Selimus, he so
exceedingly thriued; that he was made chief Bassa of the Court; and so well
deserved it, that he was accounted Selimus right hand, and was indeed the man,
to whose valor especially, the Turks owe the Kingdom of Egypt. But this is
perhaps impertinent.

BRASILE has on the North Guiana; on the South, Rio de la Plate, and Chile; on
the East, the Ocean; and on the West, the mountains of Peru, called the Andes;
which divide the Country of Peruana, as Taurus or Imaus do Asia; and mount
Atlas, Afric. These hills are high, craggie, and very barren; full of
ravenous beasts, and poisonous serpents, which they say destroyed a whole Army
of one of the Peruvian Kings, in their passages that way. Here also live a
mountain people, far more barbarous then the rest of the Americans, as being
hairie all over their bodies, going altogether naked, and living without houses
or bedding. And so I descend into the valleys of this Country.

The Air here is of a healthful temper, the Earth fat and always
flourishing. Great store of Sugars, and wonderful rich mines, are the sinews
of this Region. Hence comes our red wood, which we use in dying of clothes,
called Brasile; the trees of which are of that bigness, that whole families
live in an arm of one of them, every tree being as populous as many of our
Villages For which cause the cities here are neither many, fair, nor populous.
They which are, are called 1 S. Anna Equitum, 2 Ascensio, 3 Pernambuco, or
Pernambucke, from whence I suppose that that Brasil wood is with us called
Fernanbucke, which they use in dying and coloring clothes red.

The people here are endowed with a pretty understanding, as may seem by him,
who tartly blamed the covetousness of the French* for coming from the other
end of the world to dig for gold: but in most places they are barbarous. Men
and women go stark naked, and on high festiual days, hang Jewels in their
lips. These festival days are, when a company of good neighbors come
together to be merry, over the roasted body of a fat man, whom they cut in
collops called Boucon, and eat with great greedin^sse, and as much delectation.
They have two vile qualities, they are mindful of injuries, and forgetful of
benefits. The men cruel without measure, and the women infinitely lascivious.
They cannot pronounce the letters LFR: The reason of which one being demanded,
made answer, because they had amongst them neither Law, Faith, nor Rulers.
They are rather swimmers, as well women as men, and will stay under water an
hour together. Women in travel are here delivered without any great pain,
and presently go about their business belonging to good house-wiues: The
good man (according to the fashion of our kinder sort of husbands in England,
who are said to breed their wives children) being sick in their steed, and
keeping their bed; so far that he has brothes made him, is visited by his
gossips or neighbors, and has iunkets sent to comfort him.

There is in this country a little beast, which cannot go in less then 15
days, as far as a man can throw a stone; and is therefore called by the
Spaniards, Pigritia. Here is also an herb called Sentida, or Viua; which if
one touch it, will shut its leaves and not open them, till the man which did
displease it be gone out of sight: Here also flying fishes are said to be, but
I bind you not to believe it.

This Country was first discovered by Peter Alvari Caprali, at the expenses of
Emanuel K. of Portugal, Anno 1500: more exactly surveyed by Americus
Vespuccius, at the charges of the said Emmanuell: next by John di Empoli, a
Florentine, 1503: afterward by John Stadius, a German, Anno 1554. And by the
Edict of Pope Alexander the sixth, was appropriated to the Portugal; the rest
of America being allotted to the Castilians. In the right of Portugal, the
Castilians now possess it; though (as ^eport goes) they are like to loose
their footing. For it is said, that the West-Indian company of the united
Provinces, have taken a Town called Todos los Sanctos, standing on a capacious
Bay, with the forts belonging to it; and have since marched higher into the
Country to besiege Pernanbuco, the chief town of it.

CHILE has on the East, the Virginian Ocean; on the West, Mare del Zur; on the
North, Peru; on the South, the straights of Magellanus. It contains two
Prouince^, viz: Chica, and the Patagones. It takes denomination from the
vehemency of the cold here, (the name, it seems, importing as much;) which
is said to be such, especially in our Summer Solstice, that horses and their
riders are frozen to death, and hardened like a piece of marble. The Country
toward the midland, is very mountainous and unfruitful; toward the sea shore,
level, fruitful, and watered with diverse rivers, flowing from the mountains;
this being the chief benefit the Country reapeth from them. The Spaniards
find here good plenty of gold, abundance of honey, store of cattle, and of
wine enough for their own use: the vines brought hither out of Spain,
exceedingly prospering, as also do all their fruits, and plants, from thence
transplanted hither.

The people are very warlike, and of a gigantine stature; as being 11 foot
high. Here is a river which runs in the day time with a most violent force;
and in the night has in it no water at all: The reason is, that this river
has no constant spring, but is both begun and continued by snow falling from
the mountains; which in the heat of the day melts into waters, and are
precipitately carried to the Sea: but in the chilly coldness of the night, are
congealed; and cannot minister new supplies to the empty Channel.

This Country was discovered by Almagrus, one of Pizarroes colleagues: and
subdued by one Baldiuia, who being unfortunately taken prisoner by the enraged
Chilois, was choked with melted gold.

The chief Towns are 1 Arequipoum, much defaced by an Earthquake, 1582: 2 S.
James, built by the Spaniards, 3 Cocimbum, 4 Villadiues, 5 Baldiuia, which for
spite to its founder, was pulled down, Anno 1599: and 6 The Imperial, which
is the best Colonie of this Country; and was, before the taking of it by the
Spaniards, so populous and rich, that in a war against the Araugues their
neighbors, they put into the field 300000 fighting men. It was called by the
Spaniards, Imperial; because at their first coming into this Province, they
found Eagles with two heads, made of wood, set upon the doors and houses of
it, made perhaps by some Germans which had been here shipwracked.

The Pyris of this American Pyramid, is called Caput Victoriae, from the ships
name, wherein some of Magellanus Soldiers, by this Cape did first compass the
world. This Ferdinando Magellanus a Spaniard, and expert in navigation* was
earnestly entreated by Charles the fifth, to find (if possible it might be) a
shorter cut to the Moluccoes; this request, he willing to perform, addressed
himself to the voyage, Anno 1520, and striking Southward, passed along by this
Cape; and so through the narrow Seas, since called Fretum Magellanicum, and
being now arrived at the Moluccoes, was there killed in a battle against the
Ilanders; but the ship called Victoria, returned to Spain in safety.

We use to say that Sir Francis Drake was the first that sailed round about the
world, which may be true in a mitigated sense; viz: that he was the first
Captain or man of note that achieved this enterprise; ( Magellanus perishing
in the midst of it:) and therefore is reported to have given for his device a
Globe with this motto, Tu primus circumdedisti me. This navigation was begun
Anno 1577, and in two years and a half, with great vicissitude of fortune,
finished: concerning which his famous voyage, a Poet then living directed to
him this Epigramme: Drake, pererrati nouit quem terminus orbis,
Quemque semel mundi vidit uterque polus:
Si taceant homines facient te sydera notum;
Sol nescit comitis immemor esse sui.
Drake whom th'encompass'd earth so fully knew,
And who^ at once both poles of heaven did view;
Should men forget, the Sun could not forbear
To chronicle his fellow-trauailer.


This Fretum Magellanicum, these Magellan straights, are by M. John Dauies, who
professes to know every creek in them, thus described. For 14 leagues within
the Cape of S. Marie, lies the first straight, where it ebbeth and flows
with a violent swiftnes: the straight not being fully half a mile broad, and
the first fall into it very dangerous and doubtful. Three leagues this
straight continues, when it opens into a sea, 8 miles long, and as many
broad; beyond which lies the second straight, right West South-West from the
first, a perilous and unpleasing passage, 3 leagues long, and a mile in
breadth. This straight opens it self into another Sea, which is extended even
to the Cape of Victory, where is the straight properly called the straight of
Magellane: a place of that nature, that which way soever a man bend his course,
he shall be sure to have the wind against him. The length hereof is 40
leagues; the breadth in some places 2 leagues, in others not half a mile; the
channel on the shore-side 200 faddome, and so no hope of ancorage; the course
of the water full of turnings and changings, and so violent, that when a ship
is once entered, there is no returning. On both sides are the high mountains,
continually covered with snow, from whence proceed those dangerous
counterwindes that beat on all sides of it: a place certainly unpleasing to
view, and hazardous to pass. So far, and to this purpose, M. Dauies.

Thus much of Peruana.

THE AMERICAN ISLANDS.
The AMERICAN ISLANDS are either In the Verginian Sea, or Mare del Noort. In the
Pacifique Sea, or Mare del Zur.


THe Islands in the Pacifique Ocean, or Mare del Zur, are 1 INSVLAE SOLOMONIS,
which are in number many: the chief of which are 18, the rest not worth the
looking after. Of these 18, the three greatest are, Gaudalcanall, S. Thome, and
S. Isabella. The Ilanders are of a yellowish color, and go naked. They were
discovered by Lope Garcia di Castro, Anno 1567: and called Insulae Solomonis,
because he thought them to be the land of Ophir, to which Solomon sent for his
gold. 2 INSVLAE LATRONVM, usually called Ladrones, were discovered by
Magellanus; who gave them that name, because the inhabitants stole away his
cock boat.


The Islands of the Verginian Ocean, so called a vergendo, or Mare del Noorte,
are 1 MARGARITA, and CVBAGNA, situate nigh unto Castella Aurea. They are
deficient in Corn, Grass, Trees, and Water; insomuch that sometimes the
people gladly change for a tun of Water, a tun of wine. The abundance of
precious stones, makes some amends for these defects, from whence the name of
Margarita is imposed on it: in especial, it yields the gemmes which the
Latin Writers call Unions, because they always grow in couples. Nulli duo
reperiuntur indiscreti (says Pliny) unde nomen Vnionum scilicet Romanae
imposu^re deliciae. 3 TRINIDADO is not far distant from the former. It was
discovered by Columbus, in his last voyage, Anno sc: 1497: and is well stored
with Tobacco. 4 BACALAOS are certain Isles iying against the influxe of Canada,
nigh unto Corterialis; and owe their first discovery unto Sebastian Cabot, Anno
1447. The people of these Islands, in their most formal expression of reverence
to their King, use to rub their noses, or stroke their for-heads: which if
the king accepts or observes, and means to grace the party so adoring him,
he turns his head to his left shoulder; which is a note of especial favor.
5 BORIQVEN is divided into 2 parts, whereof the North part is most plentiful
of gold; the South part, of vital provision; as birds, cattle, and corn. Some
rivers here are, but of no greatness; the principal being called Cairobonus.
This Island is ^ituate North of Guiana. It is in length 50, in breadth 18 miles;
and is called also Insula S. Johan. The first that set foot in it was John
Ponce a Spaniard, Anno 1527. The principal cities are S. John's, and 2 Port
Rico; ruined by Henry Earl of Cumberland, Anno 1597. 6 IAMAICA or Insula S.
Iacobi, was once very populous, but now almost destitute of inhabitants; the
Spaniards having slain in this and the former Island, more then 60000 living
souls: insomuch that women, as well here, as on the Continent, did kill their
children before they had given them life; that the issues of their bodies might
not serve so cruel a nation. This Island is in length 280 miles, in breadth 70
miles. It is well watered has two towns of note; Oristana, and Seuill; and
acknowledges Columbus for its first discouerer. 7 CVBA, called also
Fernandina, is long 300, and broad 70 miles. It is full of Forests, Lakes, and
mountains: and was first made known to the Europaeans, by Columbus his second
navigation. The people here are prohibited the eating of serpents, as a dainty
reserved for the higher powers. The Ai^e is very temperate, the soil very
fertile, producing brass of exact perfection, but gold somewhat drossie. It
abounds also with ginger, cassia, masticke, aloes, cinamom, sugar, and has
of flesh, fish, and foul, no scarcity. The people before the Spaniards
arrival here, were tenants in common, money not being known among them, nor
the meaning of meum and tuum understood by them. The chief Cities are S. Iago,
a Bishops See: and Hauana a safe rode for ships, and the staple of
Merchandise. Here also rides the King of Spaine's Navy, till the time of the
year, and the convenience of the wind, join together to waste them homeward.
It is seated on the Northern shore, as also is S. Iago, this last being built
by Iago, or James de Valasco, and of him so named. The other Towns of note are
S. Christophero, and 4 S. Trinity on the South. 8 The LVCAIE above 400 in
number, g^ory in the matchless beauty of their women; and mourn for the loss
of a million of her inhabitants, Purcha^.
murdered by the Spaniards. 9 BERMVDAE, are called also Summer Islands, because
Sir Thomas Summers gave us a more exact relation of them, then before had
been. They received their first name from one John Barmudaz, who first gave us
notice of them: they are in number no less then 400: The biggest resembling a
half Moon, has in it a Colonie of English; who affirm it to be very
fruitful, and agreeable to an English nature. 10 HISPANIOLA, called by the
natives, Haitie; now lamenteth the loss of 3 millions of her inhabitants,
murdered by her new masters of Spain. It is in compass 1400 miles: inioyeth a
temperate Air, a fertile soil, rich mines, Amber, and Sugar. In 16 days
herbs will ripen, and roots also, and be fit to be eaten: a strong argument of
the exact temperature of the Air. It gives place in no respect to Cuba, but
excels it in diverse, three especially: 1 the finenesse of the gold, which
is here dug more pure and unmixed: 2ly in the increase of the sugar; one
sugar-cane here filling 20, and sometimes 30 measures: and 3ly in the goodness
of their soil for tillage, the corn here yielding an hundred fold. This
fertility is thought to be caused by four great rivers, which water and enrich
all the four quarters of the Country, viz: 1 Iuna, the East; 2 Attihinnacus,
the West; 3 Iacchus, the North; and 4 Naihus, the South* all four springing
from one mountain, which stands in the very midst and center of the Country.


The chief Towns are S. Domingo, ransackt by Sir Francis Drake, Anno 1585, 2
S. Isabella, 3 S. Thome, 4 S, John, 5 Maragna, 6 ^ortoroy^.

Hic status, haec rerum nunc est fortuna novarum.
And this is at this present time
The fortune of the new found clime.
Thus much of the Islands.

THE END OF AMERICA.
OF THE UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE WORLD.
THus much of the known parts of the World: the UNKNOWN PARTS of the world;
or rather such, of which we have but little, and that no certain relation; are
either NORTHERN, or SOVTHERNE.

-- Atqui
Quo properas mea Cymbae? redi: satis ardua Ponti
Navimus; Ecce Auster pluvias iam cogere nubes
Incipit: hic tutum non est (mihi creed) morari.
Dum licet, in portum tondamus, nubila clarum
Reddiderint ubi pulsadiem, revocabit ab alto
Nos Triton scopulo, atque iterum tentabimus aequor.
But whither goes my bark? return; for we
Have sliced the capring b^ine enough: See see
The South winds ginne to gather clouds apace,
It Is no safe tarrying in so fierce a place.
Whilst thou have time retire O wearied bark
Into safe harbor: when the clouds which dark
The worlds bright eye, shall be dispelled away;
And Phoebus shining make a lightsome day.
Tritons shrill trump shall once recall again
Thee from thy harbor to the foaming maine.
And we with all our power will surely try
What of these UNKNOWN LANDS we may discry.
