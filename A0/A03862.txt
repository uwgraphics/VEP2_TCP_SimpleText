Seven Sobs of a Sorrowful Soul for Sin. Comprehending those seven Psalms
of the Princely Prophet DAVID, commonly called Poenitentiall: framed into a
form of familiar prayers, and reduced into meeter by WILLIAM HVNNIS, one of
the Gentlemen of her Majesty's honorable Chapel, and master to the children
of the same. Whereunto are also annexed his Handful of Honisuckles; the Poor
Widows Mite; a Dialog between Christ and a sinner; diverse godly and pithie
ditties, with a Christian confess^o^ of and to the Trinity; newly printed and
augmented. 1583.

To the right Honorable and virtuous Lady, Francis, Countess of Sussex, and
one of the Ladies of her Majesty's most Honorable privy chamber: W. Hunnis
wishes increase of virtue and honor, with long life, prosperous health, godly
fear, firm faith, and assured hope in the Almighty.
THe proof of your Ladyships virtue has emboldened me to set forth this little
work under your honorable defe^se. And although a fault by me is committed in
making you patroness of so slender a piece without your knowledge, yet hoping
upon your honorable courtesy, which rather respects the mind of the giver,
than the worthiness of the gift; and poizing the giuers desire to please and
zeal to profit, more than the quality of the offense, I do assure my self to
be remitted of the trespass; which makes me think my travel not only
sweet, but also verierichlie recompensed.

Your Ladyships to command, William Hunnis.

The Author to his Book.
Pass forth my Book into the hands
and view of sundry men:
Humble thy self, declare thy name
who thee thus clad, and when.
And blush not at the frumps of some,
ne fear at others frown:
More rich thou art in threadbare cote,
than some in silken gown.
And give them all to understand,
from whence thou first did spring,
How thou wast fostred in the breast
and bosom of a king.
And so (perhaps) some worthy wight
will shape thee rich araie,
And set thee forth as thou deseru'st
with costly jewels gaie.
Behave thy self in such good fort,
if possibly may be,
That every one may thee embrace,
and wish well unto me.
Vale.
The book to his Readers.
GOod friends with favor me peruse,
half naked though I be,
Or not attird so gallantly,
as you desire to see.
Yet this from me your selves assure,
such substance here to find,
As shall bring hope unto the heart,
and comfort to the mind.
Often under short and simple weed,
such virtue may be found,
As under pall of purple hew
that traileth on the ground.
I being good, am not the worse,
though clothing mine be bad,
He that bestowd the same on me,
aid give the best he had.
In whose behalf I humbly pray,
and for my self also,
You would vouch safe to mend those faults,
that in my cote ye know.
Vale.
AWAY FRO ME, YE WICKED; FOR I WILL KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF MY GOD. Psalm, 119,
verse ii^



Psalm 150, verse 3, and 6. Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him
upon the lute and harp. Let every thing that has breath praise the Lord.
Seven Sobs of a Sorrowful Soul for Sin.
Domine ne in furore. Psalm. 6.
The first part.
1.
^ O Lord when I my self behold, how wicked
^ I have bin; And view the paths and
^ ways I went, wandering from sin to fin;
2.
^ Again, to think upon thy power, thy
^ judgment, and thy might; And how that
^ nothing can be hid, or close kept from
^ thy sight;
3
Even then (alas) I shake and quake,
and tremble where I stand,
For fear thou should revenged be,
by power of wrathful hand.
4
The weight of sin is very great,
for this to mind I call,
That one proud thought made Angels thine
from heaven to slide and fall.
5
ADAM likewise, and EVE his wife,
for breaking thy precept,
From Paradise expelled were;
and death thereby has crept
6
Upon them both; and on their seed,
for ever to remain;
But that by faith in Christ thy son,
we hope to live again.
7
The earth not able was to bear,
but quick did swallow in,
Corah, Dathan, and Abiron,
by reason of their sin.
8
Also because king DAVID did
his people number all,
Thou Lord therefore, in three days space,
such grievous plague letst fall;
9
That seventy thousand me^ forthwith,
thereof did presently,
Such was thy work, such was thy wrath,
thy mighty power to try.
10
(Alas) my sins surmounteth theirs,
mine cannot numbered be,
And from thy wrath, most mighty God,
I known not where to flee.
11
If into heaven I might ascend,
where Angels thine remain,
O Lord, thy wrath would thrust me forth
down to the earth again.
12
And in the earth here is no place
of refuge to be found,
Nor in the deep, and water course,
that passes under ground.
13
Vouchsafe therefore, I thee beseech,
on me some mercy take,
And turn thy wrath from me away,
for Jesus Christ's sake.
14
Lord in thy wrath reprove me not, Verse. 1. Domine ne in furore tuo arguas me,
neque in ira tua corripias me.

ne chaste me in thine ire;
But with thy mercy shadow me,
I humbly thee desire.
15
I know it is my grievous sins
that do thy wrath provoke,
But yet, o Lord, in rigor thine
forbear thy heavy stroke;
16
And rather with thy mercy sweet,
behold my heavy plight,
How weak and feeble I appear
before thy blessed sight.
17
For nature mine corrupted is,
and wounded with the dart
Of lust and soul concupiscence,
throughout in every part.
18
I am in sin conceived, and borne
the child of wrath and death,
Having but here a little time
to live and draw my breath.
19
I feel my self still apt and prone
to wickedness and vice,
And drowned thus in sin I lie,
and have no power to rise.
20
It is thy mercy, o sweet Christ, Verse. 2. Miserere mei domine, quonia^
infirmas sum: sana me domine quoniam co^urbata sunt omnia ossa mea.

that must my health restore:
For all my bones are troubled much,
and vexed very sore.
21
I am not able to withstand
temptations such as be,
Wherefore good Lord, vouchsafe to heal
my great infirmity.
22
Good Christ, as thou to Peter did,
reach forth thy hand to me,
When he upon the water went,
there drowned like to be.
23
And as the Leaper cleansed was,
bv touching with thy hand;
And Peter's mother raised up
from fever whole to stand:
24
So let that hand of mercy thine
make clean the leprosy
Of loathsome lust upon me grown,
through mine iniquity.
25
Then shall there strength in me appear
through grace my chief relief,
Thy death, o Christ, the medicine is
that helps all my grief.
26
My soul is troubled very sore, Verse. 3. Et anima mea conturbata est valde,
sed tu domine vsquequo?

by reason of my sin:
But Lord how long shall I abide
thus sorrowful therein?
27
I doubt not Lord, but thou which have
my stony heart made soft,
With willing mind thy grace to crave,
from time to time so often;
28
Wilt not now stay, but forth proceed,
my perfect health to make,
Although a while thou do defer,
yet is it for my sake.
29
For, Lord, thou know our nature such
if we great things obtain,
And in the getting of the same
do feel no grief or pain;
30
We little do esteem thereof:
but hardly brought to pass,
A thousand times we do esteem
much more than the other was:
31
So Lord, if thou should at the first
grant my petition,
The greatness of offenses mine,
I should not think upon.
32
Wherefore my hope still bids me cry
with faithful heart in breast,
As did the faithful Cananite,
whose daughter was possessed.
33
At least if I still knock and call
upon thy holy name,
At length thou will hear my request
and grant to me the same:
34
As did the man three loaves of bread
unto his neighbor lend,
whose knocking long forced him to rise,
and show himself a friend.
35
Lord by the mouth of thy dear son,
this promise did thou make;
That if we knock thou open wilt
the door even for his sake.
36
Wherefore we cry, we knock, we call,
and never cease will we,
Till thou do turn to us, o Lord,
that we may turn to thee.
The second part.
TVrne from thy wrath, o Lord of hosts, Verse. 4. Co^uerter^ domine, and ^^ipe
animam mea^, saluum me fac, propter misericordiam tua^.

and set my heart at large:
Oh save me for thy mercies sake,
and all my sins discharge.
2
Not for the merits I have done,
ne for the works I wrought,
But for thy endless mercy sake,
and blood which has us bought.
3
The debt is great that I am in,
not able for to pay,
And how to recompense the same,
none other can I say;
4
But goodness thine must me acquit,
or else (alas) must I
To prison, where no ransom may
set me at liberty.
5
For why in death, o God of life, Verse. 5. Quoniam non est in morte qui memor
sit tui, in inferno autem quis confitebitur tibi?

no man remembers thee,
And in the hell who gives thee thanks
was none yet known to be.
6
The grievous plagues and torments there,
so smarting be and strong,
That no man can have mind on thee,
or thee confess among.
7
No time is there or space, ne place
repentance for to find;
But burning pains, and torments sharp
to all be there assignd.
8
Remembering this while I am here,
and do this life possess,
To thee, o Lord, in humble wise,
I do my faults confess.
9
And with a spirit all sorrowful Verse. 6. Laboraui in gemitu meo, lauabo per
singulas noctes lectum meum, lachrymis meis stratu^ meum rigabe.

I do my sins lament,
And sorry am even from my soul,
I did such ways frequent:
10
And am with groaning weary made,
through taste of many fears,
The night I spend my bed to wash,
my couch to wet with tears.
11
Not weeping to the sight of men,
(as does the hypocrite,)
But in my chamber secretly,
where I my sins recite:
12
Not only with the tears of eyes,
but tears fet from allow,
That is, from bottom of my heart,
repentance great to show.
13
And as my body I have made
a servant unto sin;
So will I now, by power of grace,
delight no more therein:
14
But will the same on thee bestow,
o Lord, and freely give,
To serve thee Lord in righteousness,
the days I have to live.
15
For in this bed of flesh and blood,
and couch of sensual life,
The souls of all from Adams fall,
have lain in woe and strife.
16
And this does make our countenance
or mind to changed be,
For inward grief of this our couch
of sensuality.
17
For when we seek therein to rest,
and think some ease to find,
It after turns to our grief,
and anguish great of mind.
18
It is a serpent, fair in face
appearing to the show;
But in his tail a sting lies hid
of endless pain and woe.
19
Mine eye, o Lord, is troubled sore, Verse. 7. Turbatus est a furore oculus
meus, inueteraui inter omnes inimico^ meos.

with extreme rage and pain:
And I among mine enemies
do weak and old remain.
20
The wicked feend, mine enemy,
still seeks to devise
Some matter of occasion,
to lay before mine eyes.
21
The world also does draw me forth
to follow her delight;
My flesh to sensuality
runs on with maine and might;
22
The company of wicked sort
entise me day by day:
Thus I with them, and they with me,
(alas) still run astray.
23
These enemies I never can
be able to subdue,
It must be thou, o IESV sweet,
most mighty and most true:
24
Thou Lord which have destroyed death,
the devil likewise suppressed,
Must give me power to overcome,
whereby to live in rest.
25
Then underneath thy death and cross
I shall my sins displaie,
And strongly fight against my foes, Verse. 8. Disc^dite a me omnes, qui oper
amini iniquitatem, quoniam audiuit dominus vocem fletus ^ei.

and boldly to them say:
26
Away from me that workers be
of wickedness and sin:
For why the Lord has hard my voice*
and seen my tears therein.
27
You damned spirits, and livers lewd,
the members of the feend;
Away from me: for now your power
is brought unto an end.
28
Your prince and master of this world,
that has me turned and tossed,
Is now cast out; and all his power,
his might, and strength is lost.
29
Although you have me long time held
in prison and in thrall;
Yet are ye now clean overcome,
by Christ most strong of all.
30
I that in darkness erst was led,
do now behold the light;
The Lord my prayer sure has heard, Verse. 9. Exaudiuit deminus deprecationem
mea^, dominus orationem meam suscepit.

my suie is in his sight.
31
To thee, o Lord, for grace I praid,
and thou heardst my request,
And sentst abundant dewes thereof
unto my quiet rest.
32
I praid likewise, that all my sins
might clean remitted be,
And thou have granted my desire,
and safe deliu'red me.
33
Wherefore let all mine enemies Verse. 10. Erubesca^t and co^tur^entur
vehemene^^ omnes inimici mei: conuertantur and erubescant valde, velociter.

confounded be with shame,
And that right soon and suddenly,
o Lord I crave the same.
34
I know that all mine enemies,
shall vexed be right sore,
And that thou will put them to flight,
from henceforth evermore.
35
For what long time they have possessed
they lost in little space,
Through operation of thy power,
and working of thy grace.
36
With wrong they kept, which y^ sweet Christ
by blood have dearly bought,
And thou a mighty Champion
have turned their power to naught.
37
Lord, I therefore thy servant poor
most earnestly do pray,
To guide my feet and steps aright
in thy most holy way.
38
And that the feend mine enemy.
who seeks me to devour,
May never over my poor soul
have any strength or power:
39
But as by grace I am restord
to favor thine again;
So with that grace desend me, Lord,
from everlasting pain: Amen.
Beati quorum. Psalm. 32.
The first part.
O God, Sing this as before
I know by grace, through faith
the sinner is made just;
Though we offend, yet iustifide
by grace through faith we trust.
2
Which grace and faith, are thy good gifts
which thou have given us free,
And thorough them the works we do
are made right good to be.
3
I therefore, Lord, my faults confess,
by help of heavenly grace,
And utterly my sins forsake,
and do them all deface:
4
Beseeching thee me to admit
with those that blessed be,
And to forgive the trespasses
which I have done to thee.
5
For blessed is the man in deed, Verse. 1. Beati quorum remissae sunt iniquit
ates, and quorum tecta sunt peccata.

whose wickedness and sin,
Is clean forgiven, and covered;
as they had never bin.
6
I will not hide my sins from thee,
nor seek them to excuse;
But with my heart will them confess,
and do my self accuse;
7
For, Lord, who goes about to hide
his own iniquity,
Thou shall the same make manifest,
that all the world may see;
8
Thou will him strip and naked make,
to his perpetual blame,
When he to judgment shall arise,
and live in endless shame.
9
And therefore blessed is the man, Verse. 2. Beatus vir ^ui no^ imputauit
dominus peccatum, nec est in spiritu eius dolus.

to whom thou Lord shall say,
I not impute thy sins to thee,
nor to thy charge them lay.
10
He, in whose spirit no fraud is found,
shall blessed be also;
And look what thing he takes in hand,
shall prosper well and grow.
11
If I for sin should feign my self
all sorrowful to be,
And were not so; then should be found
both fraud and guile in me.
12
Or if I should account my self
a man that lives just,
Having my conscience stuffed with sin,
so full as may be thrust:
13
There should appear great fraud in me
for deep dissembling so;
For why, in me no goodness dwelles,
as of my self I know.
14
If ever any good were there,
it surely must be thine;
But as for sins I many have,
and they by right are mine.
15
For while, o Lord, I held my peace, Verse. 3. Quoniam ^acui, inue^ erauerunt
^ssa (...), clamando (...) die.

confessing not my crime,
My bones did waste through daily plaints
I made from time to time.
16
My soul does feeble wax and faint,
because I held my peace;
But now I have my sins confessed,
I feel her strength increase.
17
I kept that back I should have told,
or else excuse the same;
And that I should have closely kept,
did publish to my blame;
18
I hid the sins that I had done,
and they remained still;
And boasted forth the good I did,
contrary to thy will.
19
Thus were the works yt I had wrought
quite lost with their reward,
And I among that sort remain,
whom thou do not regard.
20
For day and night thy heavy hand Verse. 4. Quoniam die ac (...) grauata est
super me manus iua conuersus su^^ in aeru^na mea: dum con^igi^ur spina.

upon me thou have laid:
And in my trouble was I turned,
when I was sore afraid.
21
My tribulation scourged me,
my moisture was made ^rie,
My very backbone stricken was,
that I began to cry.
22
My conscience likewise stricken was
with prick of great remorce,
(...) ^4
Although amid this water-floud
of surging waves of sin,
We tossed be among the rocks,
yet are not drowned therein.
15
For thou, o Lord, art my refuge Verse. 7. Tues refug^^m meu^ a tribulatione,
qu^ circ^ndedit me.

from trobles all that be.
And though temptations of the world
about have compast me;
16
I not regard intisements theirs,
nor threats that they shall make:
For why my faith assures me
that thou my part wilt take.
17
Thou, Lord, art only my defense,
my joy is all in thee, Exaltatio mea, erue me a circundani tibus me.

Thou shall me compass round about,
and safe deliver me.
18
The tabernacle of my soul
is round about me set
With enemies, such as do seek
my hinderance and my let.
19
But yet, o Lord, thy providence
shall me deliver still,
And from all dangers me defend,
after thy holy will.
20
Thou will inform and show to me Verse. 8. Intellectu^ tibi dabo, and
instrua^te in via hac, qua gradieris.

the way that I should go.
This life is but a pilgrimage
I pass in to and fro.
21
Of this way Lord, thou art the end,
and mark whereat I shoot;
Grant that I may this voyage pass,
and foes of mine confute;
22
And in the running of my course,
my faith so strong may be;
That I may have one of those games
of immortality.
23
Thus shall thine eye of strong defense Firmabo super te oculos meos.

on me be fixed sure,
And I with joy shall able be
this travel to endure.
24
For, Lord, if y^ should turn thy face
or cast thine eye aside,
I should not able be to run,
nor labor this abide:
25
But should be as the horse and mule, Verse. 9. Nolite sieri sicut equu^ and
(...), quibus non est intellectus. In chamo and fraeno maxillas eorum
co^stringes, qui no^ approximabunt ad te.

that understanding want:
Such, of thy grace, faith, and good works,
both barren be and skant.
26
They are too proud and scornful eke,
thy laws to hold and keep,
The lusts and pleasures of the flesh,
so lulleth them asleep.
27
But yet the mouths of such wild beasts.
thou Lord with bit and brake
Shall snaffle them, with chain and curb,
that do thee so forsake.
28
For great and many are the plagues Verse 10. M^lta flagella pe^^atoris.

of those that sinners be,
By means whereof a number, Lord,
are turned unto thee.
29
And thou, o Lord, that did them plague
for their correction,
Wilt also give them comfort great,
and consolation.
30
And he that trusts in the Lord, Spera^tem autem in domino misericordia
circundabit.

he shallbe compast in
With mercy and remission
of all his former sin.
31
Be glad therefore ye righteous, Verse. 11. Laetamini in domino, and exultate
iusti.

and in the Lord rejoice:
For he by grace has made you just,
through his most loving choice:
32
Which were before, stifnecked, proud,
now gentle meek and mild;
Not by your merits, but by grace,
as father to his child.
33
All you that be upright of heart, Et gloriaemini omnes recti cord.

in God reioise also:
And to his will submit your will,
in anguish, pain, and woe.
34
And as S. Paul the apostle was
made glad in his distress,
So Lord in all extremity
grant me the like success: Amen.
Domine ne in furore. Psalm. 38.
The first part.
1.
^ Within my soul, o Lord, do maine
^ troubles spring, Sometime by fear of
^ punishment, that temprall things may
^ bring:
2.
Which happen may to me, while.
^ I this life abide, For mine offenses done
^ to thee, which cannot pass vnspide:
3
Sometime, o Lord, by fear
of sickness and disease,
Which here we suffer for his guilt,
that first did thee displease:
4
Sometime again by fear
of death that follow must,
Which in a time unlooked for,
shall all consume to dust:
5
And last by fear, o Lord,
of everlasting pain,
Which I by sin have well deserved
therein for to remain.
6
But yet, o blessed Lord,
when thou shall angry be; Verse. 1. Dominene in furore tuo argua^ me, neque
in ir a tu^ corripias (...).

In fury thine correct me not,
nor power thy wrath on me.
7
And though thy bow be bent,
with arrowe set therein,
And ready thou my soul to wound,
for my committed sin:
8
Yet let thy mercy move
with ruth on me I crave;
Because thou know I can not give
the thing that I not have.
9
For thou must first me give,
ere I can give to thee:
For of my self, and from my self, Verse. 2. Quoniam sagittae tuae infixae
sunt mihi.

comes but iniquity.
10
Thine arrows, I confess,
so deep have pearst my heart*
That medicine none, ne other craft
can sever them apart.
11
For if by craft I might
these wounds make whole again,
And so escape eternal death,
and everlasting pain;
12
My fear should be the less,
my joy a great deal more:
But thou, o Lord, the Leach must be,
for sickness mine and sore.
13
Thy hands thou have enforst, ^t confirmasti super me manum tua^.

so heavy upon me,
As death with dart, I know right well,
cannot avoided be.
14
O death! Unto the man
that substance has at will,
How sharp and bitter is thy dart,
when thou comst him to kill?
15
Lord in my flesh I feel Verse. 3. Non est sa^^tas in carne mea.

no health there is at all
For when I think most sure to stand
I readiest am to fall.
16
But blessed are those men,
which never did offend
In sinful lusts; but have themselves
kept clean unto the end.
17
For in their souls they find
great quietness and rest,
And every thing they take in hand,
does turn unto the best:
18
But contrary to those,
that spend the day and night
In exercise of wickedness,
and take therein delight.
19
For they in conscience feel
such business, broile, and strife,
That for to think upon their sin,
a hell is to their life.
20
O Lord, among those sort
my self have gone astraie, A faci^ irae tuae.

And from the face of anger thine,
could never flee away:
21
Yet thou have suffered me,
and given me grace at last,
For to acknowledge all my faults,
and wicked life now past.
22
My bones were void of rest, Non est pax ossibus meis a facie peccatorum meorum.

by reason of my sin,
And all my body grieved was,
without and eke within.
23
Sin may well be compared
unto a serpent vile,
Which with his body, head, and tail,
does many one beguile.
24
For where the serpents head
to enter does begin,
There all the body with the tail,
apace comes sliding in.
25
The motion first to sin
unto the head applic,
And when the heart consents thereto,
then is the body nie.
26
The fact once being done,
then is the serpents tail,
With head and body entered in,
where he must needs prevail.
27
For why, this serpent sin Verse. 4. Quoniam iniquitates (...) supergressae
sunt cap^^e me^^: and sieut onus grave grauatae sunt super me.

so high himself does rear,
Above my head, the weight of whom
is more than I can bear.
28
And this by sufferance came,
by license that I gave,
This serpents head into my soul
his entrance first to have.
29
For now has he brought in,
his body, tail, and all;
And therewith does surcharge my soul
that she is like to fall.
30
The burden is so great,
that many times (alas)
She is compeld to do the thing
she would not bring to pass.
31
Too hard it is for me
this serpent to expel;
It must be thou, o^ mighty King,
the strength of Israe^l.
32
Thou that the devils drau'st forth,
out of the men possessed,
Vouchsafe this serpent to expel,
and set my soul at rest,
33
Thy grace must work in me
to be contrite in heart,
And this from thee, to me must come,
withouten my desert.
34
My bones corrupted are, Verse. 5. Putruer^t and corrupt^esunt cicatrices meae
a facie insip^entiae meae.

and putrifide so sore,
By reason of my follies past,
that woe is me therefore.
35
The marks of my oldsinnes
do rotten wax again,
And fresh and green they do appear,
to further more my pain.
36
By reason of my sin, Miser factus sum.

I am a wretch becomme,
Setting my mind on earthly things,
like beast both brute and domm^.
37
And crooked am I made, Verse. 6. Et curuatus sum vs^que in ^inem, totae die
contriostatus ingrediebars.

unto the very end:
The day throughout continually
with woe and grief I spend.
38
Because I am thrown down,
and not compeld thereto;
No violence did me enforce
thus wickedlie to do.
39
It was my will, which led
intelligence awrie;
And that which reason willed me,
the same did I deny.
40
Will is the middle part,
Lord, of my soul, I know:
And I my will for to exalt
did reason overthrow.
41
Whereby my loins are full, Verse. 7. Quon am lumbi mei impleti sunt
illusionibus.

that is, my flesh, to say,
Replete is with illusions,
that me deceive always.
42
Ah wicked flesh of mine,
that does my soul entise!
Thou hurt'st thy self, offend'st my God,
by thy lewd exercise.
43
And by this lust of mine,
no health is in my flesh, Non est sanitas in carne ^iea.

For sin my soul and body grieves
still day by day afresh.
44
My soul tormented is, Verse. 8. Aff^ictus sum, and ^n^niliatus sum nimis.
Rugreham a gemitu cordis mei.

by sight of mind unclean;
My body weak and feeble brought,
through lust made bare and lean.
45
Thus I afflicted s^re
and very low am brought;
And am a bondsman unto sin,
in word, in deed, and thought.
46
This sin so settled is, Verse. 9. Domine cora^ te est omne desiiu^er^^ meu^,
and gemitus meus a te non est ab^conditus.

that it will not depart,
Which causes me To roar and cry,
with sorrow from my heart.
47
O Lord the great desire,
that does proceed from me,
And mourning much that I do make,
not hidden is from thee.
48
Thy sight is of great strength,
for end thereof is none,
And be the distance nere so far,
thy power and strength is one.
49
Thy sight, o God attaines,
to distance all that be,
And makes no change of more or less,
as is with us we see.
50
My heart is troubled sore, Verse. 10. Cor meum contur^atum est, dereliquit me
virtus mea, and lumen oculorum meorum, and ipsum non est (...).

my strength is gone me fro;
Likewise the sight of both mine eyes
from me is gone also.
51
The tribulations great,
wherewith my sinful heart
Is vexed, and troubled night and day,
about in every part;
52
Is, Lord, for fear of thee,
and of thy punishment,
which thou shall render unto me,
for this my life misspent.
53
O Lord, remove from me,
this cloudie mist of mine,
And with thy grace and mercy mixed
anoint my dusked eine;
54
That I the way may see,
wherein thou have delight,
And in the same my steps direct,
to walk both day and night: Amen.
The second part.
MY wretchedness, o Lord,
is more than may be said;
It Is not alonelie grief of heart,
that makes me dismayed;
2
Ne feebleness of strength,
deprest with vices all,
Nor in the blindness of my soul,
which ready is to fall:
3
But otherwise it coms,
and still increases more, Verse. 11. Amici ^ei, and proximi mei aduersum me
ap appropinquab ^nt and stete^unt.

That is, where I thought comfort find,
is turned to my sore.
4
My friends and neighbors, Lord,
in whom I put my trust,
Against me altogether stood,
and showed themselves unjust.
5
And they that stood me next,
far off got them away;
And such as waited for my life, Verse. 12. Et qui iux ta me era^t, de long
steterunt; and vim facieba^t, qui quaerebant animam meam.

set on me as a pray.
6
The force of wicked fcends,
o Lord, is very strong:
No earthly power is like to theirs,
if thou them suffer long
7
To exercise their force,
on sinners all that be;
Not one among ten thousand shall
be left alive to thee.
8
They study to deceive,
by worldly pleasures vain,
And ioies such as the flesh desires,
to bring us endless pain.
9
These Lord, have sought for me, Et qui inquirebant mala mihi, loquut^ sunt
vanitates; and dolos toto die meditabantur.

and wrought me ill the while,
And with deceitful vanities
did daily me beguile.
10
Lord many times I feel,
when I thus tempted am,
Such pleasures spring, I joy thereat,
not looking whence they came:
11
Or at the least, o Lord,
I would not understand,
Ne see the snares for me were laid,
to bring me under hand, Verse. 13. Et ego t^qua^ surdus non audiebam, and
sicut mutus non aper^ens os suu^.

12
The pleasures of the flesh
so sweet founds in mine ear,
That what is spoken there against,
I lift not for to hear:
13
But as one being dease,
with silence pass away,
And as a man that dumb is borne, Verse. 14. Et factus sum sicut homo non
audiens, and non habens in ore suo redargutiones.

have not a word to say.
14
In deed I must confess
my self, I have not fought,
Nor spoke against my wickedness,
in sort such as I ought.
15
But as one deaf and dumb,
that sin no time would blame,
Ne open would mine ears to hear,
how to avoid the same.
16
Yet true it is, o Lord,
let man his faults confess,
With sighs and sorrow from his heart,
he did thy laws transgress:
17
Yea, let him do his best,
and satisfaction make;
And yet if he be void of hope,
thou will him sure forsake.
18
For Judas sorrow made,
when he had thee betrayed,
And did restore the silver back,
and down again it laid:
19
He openly confessed,
he sinned grieuouslie,
In that he had falsely betrayed,
the innocent to die;
20
And wanting hope, we see,
into despair he fell,
And hanged himself upon a tree,
among the ravens to dwell.
21
Hope is the gift, o Lord,
that from thy grace proceeds; (love Verse. 15. Quoniam in te domine speraui,
iuexaudses me domine deus meus.

And grace brings faith, and faith brings
from whom spring fruitful deeds.
22
And for because that I
did always hope in thee,
Thou will me hear, o Lord my God,
and safe deliver me.
23
My hope is firmly fixed,
and cannot be remoou'd;
Because thy grace assures me,
my faith is not disproou'd.
24
This have I said, o Lord, Verse. 16. Quia dixi ne quan^o super gaudeant mihi
inimici mei^ and dum comouentur pedes mei, super me magna loquuti sunt.

least arie time at all
Mine enemies, should over me
triumph to see me fall.
25
For whiles my feet did slide,
against me much they spoke;
That is to say, whiles my desires,
the way to sin did take,
26
And were from thee remoou'd
to follow loathsome lust;
Then did mine enemies reioise,
to see me in the dust.
27
But Lord, I me submit,
unto thy discipline,
And meekelie take correction thine,
for old offenses mine.
28
And have my self prepared Verse. 17. Quoni^m ego in flagolla paratus sum, and
dolor meus in conspectu meo semper.

unto the whip of pain,
Whereby my grief and dolor may
still in my sight remain.
29
And, Lord, thou know of old,
there is no good in me;
Not one man good upon the earth,
not one seeks after thee.
30
Among thy chosen sort,
unfaithfulness was found,
Likewise among thy Angels bright
were thousands cast to ground:
31
Then how much more (alas)
of wretches such as I,
That dwell in houses made of clay,
must sin continually?
32
I will confess to thee Verse. 18. Quoniam iniquitate^ meam annunciabo, and
cogitabo pro peccato meo.

all mine ungodliness;
And for my sins will take more thought
than well I can express.
33
And yet, ^ Lord, thy grace
must work this good in me;
By which I steadfastly believe
I chosen am of thee.
34
For now by grace I mind
my sinful life t'amend,
And unto virtue will apply
my life unto the end.
35
I see the follies past,
wherein I took delight,
To be both vile, wicked and naught, Verse. 19. Inimici autem mei viuunt, and
confirmati sunt super me; and multiplicati sunt, qui ode^unt me inique.

and odious in thy sight.
36
And though my foes do live,
and over me made strong,
And they which hated me are great
and do me troble wrong:
37
No marvel it is, o Lord,
for why, they mighty be,
And are, except thy grace assist,
too strong always for me.
38
They have long time devised
deceitful crafty ginnes,
And by the same have overthrown
the strongest in their sins.
39
If any time I flee
repentance for to find,
Then one of these malicious spirits
assaileth straight my mind;
40
And with devises new,
and frauds that be unknown
He craftily does me subdue,
and so makes me his own.
41
Thus, Lord, when I am bent, Verse. 20. Qui retribuunt mala^ pro bonis,
detraheba^t mihi, quoniam sequebar bonitatem.

thy goodness to pursue,
Mine enemies do me detract,
and breed my bale anew.
42
The wicked feend (alas)
does many times me grieve;
The world also does follow me,
the days I have to live;
43
The flesh does me provoke
with lust both lewd and naught:
Thus by these three mine enemies,
I am in thraldom brought.
44
Yet, Lord, forsake me not, Verse. 21. Ne derelinquas me domine deus meus, ne
discesseri^ a me.

ne let thy grace depart;
Least that mine enemies unawares
do thorough pearse my heart.
45
And though sometime, o Lord,
thy presence thou withdraw,
Whereby the feend may entrance make,
and bring me more in awe:
46
Yet, Lord, thy grace restore
to me poor wretch again;
That I thereby may him resist,
to make his travel vain.
47
Give heed therefore my God, Verse. 22. Intend in adiutoriu^ meum domine deu^
s^lut is (...).

which art my help and health.
Whose mercy, and whose goodness showed
is to my soul chief wealth.
48
Give temporal health, o Lord,
as unto thee seems best;
And to my soul thy saving health,
in heaven with thee may rest: Amen.
Miserere mei. Psalm. 51.
The first part.
1.
^ O thou that made the world of naught,
^ whom God thy creatures call, Which formedst
^ man like to thy self, yet suffredst
^ him to fall:
2.
Thou God, which by
^ thy heavenly word did^^ flesh of virgin
^ take, And so becam'st both God and man,
^ for sinful fleshes sake:
3
O thou that saw when man by sin
to hell was overthrown,
Did meekelie suffer death on cross,
to have thy mercy known:
4
Thou God, which did the Patriarks
and fathers old divine,
From time to time preserve and keep*
by mercy great of thine:
5
O thou that Noah keptst from flood,
and Abram day by day,
As he along through Egypt past,
did guide him in the way:
6
Thou God that Lot from Sodoms plague
did safely keep also,
And Daniel from the lions jaws,
thy mercy great to show:
7
O thou good God, that did divide
the sea like hills to stand,
That children thine might thorough pas
from cruel Pharoes hand;
8
So that when Pharao and his host,
thy children did subdue,
Thou ouerthrewst them in the sea,
to prove thy saiengs true:
9
O thou that Jonas in the fish
three days did keep from pain,
Which was a figure of thy death,
and rising up again:
10
I say, thou God, which did preserve
amidst the fiery flame,
The three young men, which sang therein
the glory of thy name:
11
Thou God have mercy on my soul, Verse. ^. Miserere mei deus secundum magnam
misericordiam tuam: and secundu^ multitudinem miserationum tuarum de* le
iniquitatem meam.

thy goodness me restore,
And for thy mercies infinite
think on my sin no more.
12
O Lord the number of my sins
is more than can be told,
Wherefore I humbly do desire
thy mercies manifold.
13
For small offense thy mercy small
may soon small faults suffice,
But I (alas) for many faults
for greater mercy cries.
14
And though the number of my sins,
surpass the salt sea sand,
And that the filth of them deserve,
the wrath of thy just hand:
15
Yet do thy mercies far surmount,
the sins of all in all,
Thou will with mercy us relieve,
for mercy when we call.
16
Right well I know, man has not power
so much for to transgress,
As thou with mercy may forgive
through thine almightinesse.
17
I do confess my faults be more
than thousands else beside,
More noisome, and more odious,
more fowler to be tried,
18
Than ever was the loathsome swine,
or menstruall cloth beeraid:
To think thereon my woeful soul,
(alas) is yet afraid.
19
Wherefore, good Lord, do notbehold
how wicked I have bin,
But wash me from my wickedness, Verse. 2. Amplius laua me ab iniquitate mea,
and a peccato meo munda me.

and cleanse me from my sin.
20
The Israe^lites being defiled
durst not approach thee nie,
Till they their garments and themselves
had washed decently.
21
The Priests also eke cleansed were
ere they thy face would see,
Else had they perished in their sin;
such, Lord, was thy decree.
22
Alas how much more need I then
to crave while I am here,
To wash my foul and spotted soul
that it may clean appear?
23
Polluted cloths with filth distaind
do manic washings crave,
Ere that the Launder can obtain
the thing that he would have.
24
My soul likewise (alas) does need
thy many dewes of grace,
Ere it be clean; for cankred sin
so deep has taken place.
25
The Leprosy that Naman had,
could not be done away,
Till he seven times in lordan flood
had washed him day by day.
26
How many waters need I then
for to be washed in,
Ere I be purged fair and clean,
and cleansed from my sin?
27
But, Lord, thy mercy is the Soap,
and washing lee also,
That shall both scowre and cleanse the filth
which in my soul do grow.
28
Why should I then (alas) despair
of goodness thine to me,
When that thy justice wills me
to put my trust in thee,
29
Thy promise, Lord, thy mouth has past,
which cannot be but true,
That thou will mercy have on them,
that turn to thee anew.
30
I know, when heaven and earth shall pass,
this promise shall stand fast:
Wherefore into thy Majesty,
I offer now at last,
31
An heart contri^e and sorrowful, Verse. 3. Quoniam iniquitate^ meam ego
cognes^o, and peccatu^ meum contra me es^ semper.

with all humility;
For heinous sins by it conceiu^d
through mine iniquity.
32
I do acknowledge all my faults,
my sins stand me before;
I have them in remembrance, Lord,
and will for evermore.
33
Because thou should the same forget
I still do think thereon,
And set it up before my face,
always to look upon.
34
Against thee ^nlie have I ^ind
and done ill in thy sight; Verse. 4. Tibisoli peccaui, and malum corate feci.

In whom it lies to punish me,
or to forgive me quight.
35
But sure my hope is firmly fixed,
that thou will me forgive;
For with thine honor shall it stand,
to suffer me to live:
36
That all the world may witness thee, Vt iustisiceris in sermonibus ^uis, and
vinca^ cu^ iudi^aris.

a judge most just to be,
For that thou will thy promise keep,
to all that trust in thee:
37
That is, our sins thou will remit,
and clean forget them all,
And bend thine ears unto our plaints,
when we upon thee call.
38
O Lord consider with thy self,
what metal I possess;
Behold in sin I was conceiud, Verse. 5. Ecce ^nim in iniquitatthus co^ceptus
sum and in peccatis con^ep^t me (...) mea.

and borne in wickedness,
39
From Adam first this sin was drawn,
whereby I am made prone
To do the ill should thee offend,
and let the good alone.
40
Yea, many a time I am so drawn
to do I would not do,
And that I would I leave undone,
for want of might thereto;
41
Such is, o Lord, the strength and force
of my concupiscence:
But yet of greater force than this,
is, Lord, thine indulgence.
42
For thou will mercy show to them,
that mercy do require;
And wilt not turn thy face from such
as mercy do desire.
43
Surely of honor more is thine,
through pity men to save;
Than by thy justice to condemn
such as deserved have.
44
Therefore, o Lord, receive me now,
which do my self accuse;
To th'nd thou should my sins forgive,
and all my faults excuse.
45
O Lord, I do not hide my sins,
but show them unto thee;
Because thou should thy mercy grant,
as thou have promisd me.
46
For never yet thou have been found
in any word unjust,
Ne can thou now begin at me,
since that in thee I trust.
47
Thou, Lord, have ever loved truth, Verse. 6. Eteni^ veritatem dilexisti.

and truth thou art most sure,
Thou art the very verity
for ever to endure.
48
Thou promisedst to Abraham,
his seed to multiply,
Even as the stars, and as the sand
that in the sea does lie.
49
To Ishac and to Jacob eke,
like promise did thou make;
And thou the same performed have,
for this thy promise sake.
50
Thou promisedst to Iosue,
to strength him with thine hand;
And so he slew the Chananites,
and did divide their land.
51
To Gedeon thou promise made,
that he should set at large
The Israelites, which were in thrall,
and in their enemies charge.
52
When Ezechias lay sore sick;
and well nie at deaths door;
Thou promis'dst him his health again,
to live fifteen years more.
53
Thus have thou kept thy promises,
to thousands else beside;
Who have reposed trust in thee,
thou have not help denide.
54
Even so, good Lord, thy promise keep
with me that am unjust,
A scabbed sheep, one of thy flock,
and ouerchargd with lust.
55
Which of long time have run astray,
the time since I was borne,
Yet now returned with heavy heart,
that is with repentance torn.
56
Thus has thy grace now called me,
with mercy of thine hand;
And what thy will and pleasure is,
by grace I understand.
57
Thou have revealed unto me
the things that be unknown,
The secret points of wisdom thine
thy grace to me has shown. Incerta and occulta (...) manifestasti mihi.

58
The mysteries that hidden were
within thy sacred word,
Thou have to us made manifest,
by Jesus Christ our Lord.
59
I am now fed with bread of life,
that shall my hunger slake;
And from dame wisedoms water-springs
my drink I often take.
60
Now wisdom has cast out her flood,
the plants all watered be,
And still she seeks to lighten those,
that put their trust in thee.
61
Of this her flood S. Paul did drink,
and he us taught thereby,
Thy wisdom, Lord, which secret was,
and hidden long did lie:
62
As thou to him did manifest,
by thy free spirit before,
Which searches out the very depth
of secrets thine and store.
63
Of this, Lord, part I tasted have,
through mercy showed to me,
And am now taught by them to know,
mine own infirmity:
64
And by it am I taught likewise
thy goodne^^e for to know,
Beseeching thee this work begun,
may never part me fro.
65
So that the light which kindled is,
in me by thy great grace,
May so increase, as darkness, Lord,
may never more take place.
The third part.
With Hyssope, Lord, besprinkle me, Verse. 7. Asperges me donune Hyssope and
(...): lauabis me, and supra niu^m d^alba^or.

and cleanse me from my sin:
More whiter then shall I be made,
than ever snow has bin:
2
Thou did command this herb with blood
a sprinkle for to be,
To sprinkle such as cleansed were
from loathsome leprosy.
3
A bundle of this herb, o Lord,
thou did command also
To dip in blood of simple sheep,
and therewithal to show
4
Upon the doore-posts of the house,
the slaier might it see,
Whereby the plague might shun the place
and from thy people flee.
5
These unto us do represent
the blood of thy dear Son,
Without the which no man is clean,
what ever can be done.
6
And he that marks his soul therewith
and puts his trust therein,
The slaier has no power to hurt,
nor plague him for his sin.
7
If with this grace thou sprinkle me,
I shall be white I know;
And though as blood my sins appear,
they shall be like the snow:
8
Yea, though my sins as purple were
or as the scarlet die,
Thy grace shall make them as the wool,
t'appeare before thine eye.
9
Then shall I hear the words of joy, Verse, 8. Auditui meo dabis gaudium and
laetitia^.

of gladness so likewise,
That Nathan to king David spoke,
whom thou did not despise.
10
That is, My sins are now put out,
what ever I have done,
And are forgiven me quite and clean,
by Jesus Christ thy son.
11
Then shall I hear the words Christ spoke,
to him the palsy had;
My son thy sins are thee forgiven,
arise, go home, be glad.
12
Then shall I hear thee also speak
by inspiration,
Whereby I shall be comforted
in tribulation.
13
Yea, Lord, The bones thou broken have, E^ exultabunt o^^a quae conf^egisti*

shall then again rejoice*
Through working of thy heavenly grace
and sweetness of thy voice:
14
That is, The powers of my poor soul
whom sin so weak has brought,
Whereby it wanted power to work
the good it long time sought,
15
Shall then recover that was lost,
and be revived again,
And through the quickening of the spirit
sin shall no more remain.
16
Wherefore, Thy face turn from my sins, Verse. 9. Auertc faciem tu^m a
peccatis meis, and omnes iniquitates meas dele.

and wipe my faults away,
And eke all mine iniquities;
most humbly I thee pray:
17
I mean the face of justice thine,
where with thou do behold
The sins we daily do commit,
to punish manifold:
18
This face, good Lord, turn you from me
and from the faults I make,
And them forget, and me forgive,
for thy great mercy sake.
19
But, Lord, the face of mercy thine,
from me turn not away,
But therewithal behold me still,
and help me day by day.
20
For what am I, if that thy grace
thou take away from me?
A bondsman under sin and death,
and cast away of the^.
21
And every man thy grace that wants
shall have an heart of stone,
As Pharao had, after thy grace
departed was and gone.
22
He shall both see and hear indeed,
yet shall be deaf and blind;
His ears and eyes shall stopped be,
the truth he shall not find.
23
His heart likewise shall frozen be,
or as the stony wall;
He shall thy creatures like and love,
and love not thee at all:
24
Yea, such a heart, o Lord, in me
long time has taken place,
Which no way can be mollifide,
but by thy special grace.
25
Wherefore I pray thee hart^lie,
remove this heart from me;
And, Lord, in me a new heart make, Verse. 10. Cor mundum cre^ in me deus.

that flexible may be:
26
A fleshie heart, both soft and meek,
an heart that I may know
Thou art the Lord, without whose grace
no goodness I can show.
27
This grace it is that must revive
a right spirit, Lord, in me. E^t spiritu^ rectum.

My spirit through sin is crooked made,
and loathsome for to see.
28
Make it upright therefore to be, Innou^ in visceribus mei^.

and that decline it may
From worldly pleasures light and vain,
that vanish soon away.
29
Vouchsafe, o Lord, to heavenly things
my spirit may still aspire,
And with thy grace replenisht be,
most humbly I desire.
30
Let neither yet adversity,
nor worldly wealth also
Pluck down my spirit, nor hinder it,
where it desires to go.
31
Nor cast me off at any time, Verse. 11. Ne proi^cias me a facie tua; and
spiritu^ sanct^n tuu^ ne auferas a me.

from presence of thy face;
Ne take from me thy holy spirit,
o Lord, in any case.
32
My sins, good Lord, behind thee cast,
there ever to remain:
But cast not me from thy sweet face,
as thou did wicked Caine.
33
Nor from thy favor cast me so,
as thou did cast king Saul,
For if that I thy presence loose,
I cannot choose but fall.
34
O Lord how sweet and gracious
is this thy spirit most pure!
It leads those that loves thee,
where righteous folk endure.
35
Grant, Lord, that this thy holy spirit
may dwell within me still,
And me confirm in righteousness,
according to thy will.
The fourth part.
O Lord my God, restore to me
thy saving health again, Verse. 12. Read mihi Laetitia^ salutaris tui, and
spiritu principal^ confirma m^.

And stablish me with thy chee^e spirit,
that it may still remain,
2
My sins, o Lord, have been the cause
that I thy grace did want,
And when thy grace departed was,
I found thy spirit but scant:
3
The loss whereof did grieve me much,
and by the same I found
All goodness gone, all wickedness
within me to abound.
4
For light and darkness may not be*
at one time in one place;
No more may sin and wickedness
associate be with gra^e.
5
Wherefore, the greatness of my loss
has made my grief the more;
And where in sin I had delight,
I now repent it sore.
6
Behold therefore, most mighty God,
mine inward grief of mind;
And of thy goodness me restore,
to that I cannot find:
7
I mean thy holy sacred spirit,
which I through weakness lost,
Mine enemies were strong and fierce,
and cruelly me tossed:
8
So that my soul too feeble was,
their power for to withstand;
Good Lord in grace yet once again
confirm me with thy hand:
9
And let thy spirit no more depart,
no Lord, not when I die,
But that it may still with my soul
remain continually.
10
Then shall I steadfastly instruct
the wicked in thy way, Verse. 13. Docebo iniquos vias ^uas; and ^npij ad ^e
conuertentur

Whereby they may to thee return,
that long have gone astraie.
11
I will my self put forth, o Lord,
to sinners all that be,
As an example them to cause
for to return to thee.
12
I will not cease for to declare
thy justice every where,
And of thy judgment bring them all
in terror and in fear.
13
And then will I again extol
thy mercies over all,
To pluck them from despairing, Lord,
least any therein fall.
14
Thus shall I able to do,
being confirmd in thee,
By working of thy holy spirit,
which thou shall put in me.
15
Thy servant Moses was afraid
to go on message sent,
Till thou promis'dst to be with him,
when he to Pharao went:
16
After which time he doubted not,
but forth went on his way,
Accomplishing thy holy hest,
as thou did bid him say.
17
the seventy elders of the host,
to thee whom Moses brought,
Till part of Moses spirit they had,
were able to do naught:
18
But after that, they prophesied,
and did the people guide,
And ruled them with righteousness
and truth on every side.
19
Lord, Peter at a woman's voice,
thy sweet son Christ denaid,
And ready was him to forsake;
he was so sore afraid:
20
Until that thou reuiuedst him
with this thy spirit of grace:
Yea, Lord, thy sons Apostles all
were bidden for a space
21
To bide within Jerusalem,
in prayer and in love;
Till they were with thy holy spirit
fulfilled from above.
22
Wherefore send down thy noble spirit
in me the same to be,
And from the guiltiness of blood, Verse. 4. Libera me de sanguinibus deus deus
salutis meae.

good God deliver me.
The fifth part.
THou God, that God art of my health,
deliver me, I pray,
From sin that I committed have
against thee day by day.
2
A multitude of sins there be
from flesh and blood that grow,
Which I through my concupiscence
have daily done I know.
3
And this corruption is in me
by nature, as I find;
For what is he can make that clean,
that is unclean by kind?
4
How can a man of woman borne
be clean? I feign would know;
The child that is but one day old,
is yet unclean also.
5
Thus flesh and blood such works bring forth,
as aie corrupted be,
And therefore cannot heaven enioie,
ne dwell and reign with thee.
6
Upon corrupted nature mine,
o Lord, power forth thy grace;
And from these bloods deliver me,
and all my sins deface.
7
Then, Lord, shall I be purged clean
from all my wickedness,
Which grant, good God, So shall my tongue
exalt thy righteousness: Et exalt^bit lingu^ mea iustitia^ tu^n^,

8
In that thou mercy shewst to me,
being a wicked man,
Giving me grace pensive to be,
my grievous sins to scan.
9
Making me just that am unjust,
wherein thou God art found,
In mercy, truth, and righteousness
most perfect, sure and sound.
10
But yet, o Lord, before my tongue
thy righteousness can raise,
My lips and mouth thou open must, Verse. 15. Domine labia mea aperies, and os
meu^ annunciab^^ laude^ (...)

whereby to show thy praise.
11
For else, unseemly praise will be,
where lips be lickt with sin;
And where the mouth with wickedness
is stuffed full within.
12
Good Lord, the Prophet Esaie,
when he thy glory saw,
Confessed his lips to be unclean,
and therefor stood in awe;
13
Until such time a Seraphin
thou sent'st, with burning cole
His lips to touch, and therewithal
he by and by was whole:
14
I mean that his unrighteousness
was then forgiven him quight,
And all his sins and wickedness
was clean put out of sight.
15
O Lord my God, in such a sort
vouchsafe my mouth to tuch*
That I thy glory may set forth
to little and to much.
16
To offer sacrifice to thee, Verse. 16. Quoniam si voluisses sacrificium,
dedissem vti^^* holocaustis non delectaberis.

or offerings burnt were vain;
No pleasure, Lord, have thou in them,
nor ought in them remain.
17
They were but figures of that thing,
which now to pass is come,
That is, the lively sacrifice
of Jesus Christ thy son.
18
To offer gold to thee, o Lord,
or treasure of the land,
It needs not; since all the world
is thine, and at thy hand.
19
And yet I will not empty come,
but offer unto thee
An humble spirit, with heart contrit^, Verse. 17. Sacrificiu^ deo spiritus
contribul^tus; cor contritu^ and humiliat^m deus non despicies.

for mine iniquity.
20
This sacrifice, o Lord, I know
thou will no time despise;
But it behold, and look thereon
with thy most gracious eyes:
21
And, Lord, for y^ there nothing should
be left behind in me,
Both body, soul, and all her powers
I offer unto thee:
22
And as a lively sacrifice,
as Ezechias did,
Such time as he thy favor got,
and health rcouerid.
23
The same did Marie Magdalen
offer in humble sort:
The thief also upon the cross
to his endless comfort.
24
Great numbers mo unspeakable
by this thy favor wan;
And I, through grace, now penitent,
although a sinful man,
25
Do claim no less of mercy thine,
for to be showed to me:
Because thou art, as then thou wast,
and evermore shall be.
^6
To Sion, Lord, likewise show forth
thy favor and thy grace; Verse. 18. Benign^ fac domin^ in bona voluntate tu^
Sio^.

That is, unto thy faithful flock
dispersed from place to place.
27
Such as depend on thee alone,
and do themselves forsake,
Upon the walls of this thy fort
thou, Lord, must undertake
28
Watchmen to set, continually
the same for to defend,
Least that the enemies unawares
bring all to woeful end.
29
Thou know, o Lord, of what small force
mankind has ever bin,
Since first our father Adam fell,
when he committed sin.
30
Help us therefore, most mighty God,
so with thy heavenly grace.
As we in building Sion here,
by faith may see thy face:
31
So shall we then, through mercy thine
be squared stones meet found
To building of Jerusalem, Vt aedifice^ ^ur muri ^erusale^.

whose walls do still abound
32
With lively stones of thy true church
here militant in earth;
Where thine elect still offer shall,
while thou shall spare them breath,
33
Such offerings burnt, as thou best love
which is of thanks and prai^e,
We shall not spare the same to do,
while life shall length our days.
34
This sacrifice of justice is, Sacrifici^s^ just it^ae.

which all thy creatures crave
To give the same only to thee,
most worthy so to have. Verse. 19. Tunc acceptabis ^blationes and holoca^ sta,
tun^ imponent super altar tuu^ vitulos.

35
This is the bullocks of our lips,
whereof the Prophet says,
We shall with lips unto thy name
confess most condign praise:
36
Which shall to thee accepted be,
ten thousand times much more,
Then were the bullocks great and fat.
offered in time before.
37
Lord grant we may in number be
of thine elected sort,
which shall this sacrifice present
unto our souls comfort:
38
And that as burning incense sweet
thou will receive the same,
Upon thine altar, which is Christ,
our mean for sin and blame: Amen.
Domine exaudi. Psalm. 102.
The first part.
OBlessed and most mighty God, Sing this t^ the tune of 51. Psalm.

of grace the fountain, spring
Of mercy, great and plentiful,
most rich in every thing:
2
Thy blessed son in power with thee,
is even the same thou art,
In wisdom, knowledge, and mercy
alike in every part:
3
Thou did not spare him down to send
from heavenly throne above,
To suffer death, mankind to save;
so ardent was thy love.
4
Thou made him poor was rich before
to make us rich thereby;
For now is he made one with us,
through power of Deity.
5
Good Lord my prayer hearken t^, Verse. 1. Domine exaudi^rationem meam, and
clamor (...) ad ^e ven^at.

and let my doleful cry
Come unto thee, and pearse the ears
of thine high Majesty.
6
Show forth, o Lord, thy countenance
of delectable show,
And with the eyes of pity thine,
some favor on me throw. Verse. 2. Non auertas faciem tuam a me in quacunque
die tri^ulor incl^na ad me a^rem tu^m.

7
And in the day of trouble mine
thine ear bow down to me,
And turn not thou thy face away,
when I shall call on thee:
8
But chee^lie at the point of death,
give ear and me defend;
And let thy grace procure and work
in me a ioifull end.
9
In whatsoever day I call, In quacunque die ^^uocauero te, velociter exaudi me.

o Lord, with speed give ear:
And me deliver from the greefs
of troubles and of fear.
10
In speedy calling on thy name,
o Lord, thou take delight,
And answer thine more ready is,
than any may recite.
11
Wherefore in have make speed, o Lord,
in hearing, when I pray;
As I by need am driven to crave
thi^e aiding help and stay.
12
For why, the time of life is short
that I have here to bide,
And am uncertain of the time
when time from me shall slide.
13
At first thou Adam did in due,
when he created was,
With life of immortality;
but sin brought death (alas)
14
Which death from him is due to us,
that bears life this day, Verse. 3. Quia de^ecerunt sicut ^umus dies (...)
.
So that my days like to the smoke
consume and waste away.
15
Age ouertaketh youth, I see,
and youth by stealth does fly,
As does the smoke vanish away
aloft under the sky.
16
Yea many times it chances so,
ere age come us upon,
That death by stroke such wound does make
that life with speed is gone.
17
Thus passes forth my time of life,
more swifter I may sa^e,
Than is the ship good under sail,
or eagle after pray.
18
My bones are waxen very dry, Et ossa me^ sicu^ cremium ^ruerunt.

as is the fierbrand,
Or as the pot of claie, which does
in flaming furnace stand.
19
As bones of mine do well sustain
the flesh the body keeps;
So does the powers of soul sustain
the soul that never sleeps:
20
Which being moistened with thy grace
shall quick and lively be,
And able for to work those works
most pleasing unto thee.
21
But if thy grace be still withdrawn,
then all shall dry remain;
Both body, soul, and al their powers
in everlasting pain. Verse. 4. Percussu^ ^um vt fae^u^, and aruit cor meum.

22
Full well may man be likened i^
the grass or withered ha^,
My heart is stricken with remorse,
because I went astray.
23
So long as man by gift of grace
does live, and work aright:
So long is he green flourishing,
and lively in thy sight.
24
But when that sin makes entry in,
which causes man to fall,
Then by and by he withers,
and barren is withal.
25
I have forgot my bread to eat, Quia oblitus sum co^ed^re pane^ meum.

that thou to me did give;
Which is thy holy sacred word,
by which my soul does live.
26
And I have eaten of the fruit
of the forbidden tree,
And tasted have of sin and death,
and brought thy wrath on me.
27
Wherefore my leaves wither away,
my fruit falls on the ground,
And as a barren tree am left
imperfect and unsound.
28
The fearful voice of sentence thine,
for mine offenses done,
Does cause me mourn, lament and groan
my time yet for to run. verse. 5. A voce gemitus mei, adhaesit os meum carni
meae.

29
And with the voice of mourning mine,
my bones have cleaued hard
unto my flesh, and stick so fast,
that nothing I regard.
30
Thus like unto a pelican
I draw my self alone, Verse. 6. S^milis factus sum pellicano solitudinis.

And call to mind my grievous crimes,
and do the same bemone.
31
The pelican as some report,
her harmless birds does kill,
And three days after mourns she,
and is unquiet still;
32
Then with her break her breast she plucks
till blood guish out amain,
Which she lets drop upon her young,
till they revive again.
33
Thus, Lord, do I with my sweet birds,
which are my works through grace,
By sin committed I them kill,
and do them all deface:
34
But yet by prayer for thy grace,
which springs of grace indeed,
The said dead works are quick again,
my sickly soul to feed.
35
And Adam was a pelican,
touching some property;
For through his ^inne he slew the birds
came of his progeny:
36
And dead he had remained still,
had not sweet Christ thy son
Shed forth his blood, us to revive,
by mercy great was done.
37
He kills, and can raise up to life;
he strikes, and heales again;
As in the persecution
of Paul appeered plain.
38
Shame causes me for to withdraw
my self to be alone, Factus sum sicut ^yctico^ax in do^icili^.

As does the crow that flies by night,
which would be seen of none.
39
And if I could, I would me hide
from thee, as Adam did,
Such time he tasted of the fruit,
that thou did him forbid,
40
The works of darkness loved I,
and therefore did I flee
From the most bright and shining sun
of justice due to me. Verse. 7. Vigilaui and factus ^um sicu^ passer
so^^tarius in tecto.

41
O Lord, for this cause do I sigh,
still sorrow, weep, and wail,
As one that ouerwatched is,
whose rest and sleep does fail.
42
And as the sparrowe do I watch,
that draws her self alone*
Under the euings of the house,
her fellows want to moan.
43
And to augment my grief withal,
mine enemies all day
Do rail on me, and me revile; Verse. 8. Tota di^ exprobr^bant m^hi inimici
mei.

so spiteful as they may.
44
Alas, again, My feined friends,
that praised me before,
Against me now conspire themselves, Et quilaud ^bant me, aduersum me tur^bant.

and vex me very sore.
45
Such false and feined flatring friends,
much worse and harmefull be,
Than those that openly profess
and show their en^mitie.
46
But both those sorts are sent to me,
for plague unto my sin,
And for the great iniquity
that I have wallowed in.
The second part.
My bread with ashes do I eat; Verse. 9. Quia cinerem tanqua^ p^nem
ma^ducabam.

that is, I right well know,
As I of earth and slime was made,
to earth again shall go.
2
Thus, in such bitter thoughts as these,
I eat my bread withal,
And ming my drink with weeping tears, Et potum meum cu^ fletu misceba^.

that from mine eyes do fall:
3
Bicau^e thou angry art with me
for mine offenses past;
O Lord, I know when time shall come,
of judgment day at last: Verse. 10. A facie i^ae and indignationis tuae.

4
Thy wrath and Indignation,
shall then proceed from thee,
And fall upon the heads of those
that work iniquity.
5
O Lord theu have me lifted up, Quia ele^asti me, and allisisti me.

and thrown me to the ground,
In that thou made me like thy self,
ere I was to be found.
6
No higher could thou lift me up
than to beatitude;
But then (alas) thou let'st me fall,
whereby I this conclude.
7
My noble soul thou joined have
with massy earth and claie,
And body frail, the weight whereof
drives down my mind alwaie,
8
and Lord, in my creation
thou have set me so hie,
Above all other creatures
that are under the sky.
9
And almost equal am I made
with blessed Angels thine;
But in this state when I transgress,
damnation then is mine.
10
So that without thy mercies help
I am in far worse plight
Than any beast, whose life or soul
with body dies outright.
11
My days (alas) away d^o pass, Verse. 11. Dies mei sicut vmbra de^linauerunt,
and ego sicu^ faenum aru^.

as shadow new begun;
And I am withered like the grass,
changed by heat of sun.
12
Lord grant in shadow of this life,
I may have grace to see
The light and knowledge of thy word,
and ways prepared for me:
13
Which word gives light unto the babe
yet sucking at the breast;
For after that this life is past,
repentance none does rest.
14
And since the time, o Lord, is short
of mine abiding here,
Thy grace continue toward me,
my guiltiness to clear.
15
For truly thine abiding is
for ever to endure, Verse. 12. Tu aute^ domine in aeternu^ permanes, and
memoriale tuum in generationem and generationem.

And thy remembrance throughout
all generations sure.
16
But what is thy rememberance,
through generations all?
It is the divine property,
that unto thee does fall.
17
For to be meek and merciful,
which thou have ever done,
From time to time, and age to age,
since first the world begone;
18
And art more mindful of our state,
and readier to forgive,
Than is the mother of her child
late borne with her to live.
19
Arise therefore, and mercy show, Verse. 13. Tu exsu^^ens musereberis Sion.

good Lord, upon Sion,
Which is thy faithful people all,
or congregation.
20
For time it is on her to look, Quia tempu^ miserendi e^^s, quia vemt tempu^.

and mercy thine extend;
She has long time great pain sustaind,
whereof the craves an end.
21
What is this time, whereof we speak?
was ever any time,
In which thou did not mercy show
to loving servants thine?
22
No verelie. For from the time
the angels down did fall,
Until the time the world shall end,
thy mercy ever shall,
23
As it has bin, from time to time,
upon all that repent;
But cheeflie was thy mercy showed
when Christ was hither sent
24
To suffer death, to win us life:
thereby he enter might
The glory of thy Majesty,
above the angels bright.
25
This time was called the time of grace,
and was appointed, when
The fullness of the time was come,
which was unseen to men.
26
And yet before, this time to him
was seen by Deity,
Whereby, o Lord, all things thou do
in order with mercy.
27
This time of heavenly grace we trust
shall still continue hear,
To those in time that serves thee
with penance, love and fear.
28
The stone of Sion pleased well
thy servants for thy truth, Verse. 14. Quoniam placueru^t seruis tuis lapides
eius, and terrae eius miserebuntur.

and they upon the ground thereof
shall pity have and ruth.
29
Apostles thine thy servants were,
the stones good Christians be;
And thou the sure foundation
of this fair work to see.
30
Not upon man, nor angels bright
did they this building lay; Verse. 15. Et timebunt gentes nomen tuum domine,
and omnes reges terrae gloriam tuam.

But upon thee the corner stone,
of all their work the stay.
31
And as the heathen, Lord, shall fear
and tremble at thy name;
So Sion shall thy faithful Church,
give glory to the same.
32
Because thou, Lord, have Sion built,
thou will be seen therein, Verse. 16. Quia aedisicauit dominus Sion* and
videbitur in gloria ^^a.

In glory and great majesty,
with mercy for our sin.
33
Wherefore, most loving father dear,
regard our humble suit,
And not despise the plaints we make,
nor do our sins impute. Verse. 17. Respexit in orationem humilium, and non
spre^it precem eorum.

34
As thou beheldst the sacrifice
that Abel gave to thee,
And as the prayer ludith made;
so cast thine eye on me.
35
With those same eyes vouchsafe to look
upon us, when we pray,
Whereby the fame of mercy thine
may wirtten before aie
36
For those that after us shall come, Verse. 18. Scriba^tur baec ^ generatione
altera, and pop^lus qui creabitur lau^abit domim^n.

by faith that borne shall be,
To render thanks, due laud, and praise
unto thy Majesty.
37
This mercy sure annexed is
to nature thine divine;
When all was lost through deadly sin,
yet did thou make us thine.
38
Thou Lord aloft, Verse. 19. Quia prospexit de excelso sancto suo dominus de
caelo in terram aspexit.
from heavenly throne,
did view all things allow;
And would vouchsafe upon the earth
thy gracious eyne to throw;
39
To see and hear the plaints we make,
that ^ettered be in thrall,
And sent'st thy dear beloved son
from sin to loose us all: Verse. 20. Vt audiret gemitus compcditorum, vt
soluerec silios interemptorum.

40
And he thereby put down the devil,
of death that victor was,
And death in vict'rie was consumed,
this has he brought to pas.
41
For why his sting of deadly sin,
thou Lord have plucked away,
To make us think of goodness thine
wherein reioise we may:
42
And that in Sion we may show
the glory of thy name, Verse. 21. Vt. annuncient in Sion nomen domini, and
laudem eius in Jerusalem.

And likewise in Jerusalem
with praise to do the same:
43
That is, when we together meet
in faith, with one accord,
As well the kings, as subjects poor,
to serve and praise the Lord. Verse. 22. Quum colligentur populi simul, and
reges, ve seruiant deo,

44
Thou art, o Lord, in substance one,
and yet in persons three;
To whom all powers in heaven and earth,
obeisance give to thee.
45
Thou sendest down thy dews of grace
upon us for to light,
That we therewith good works may show
to every bodies sight.
46
I answer may, Verse. 23. Respondiei in via virtutis suae.
by no means else,
good works be wrought by me,
But by the virtue and the grace,
that does proceed from thee.
47
Thorough thy might thy laws we keep
not of our selves we know,
But by the measure of thy grace,
thou did on us bestow. Paucitate^ di^rum me^rum nuncia mihi.

48
And yet o Lord, I feign would know
how short my days shall be;
And eke how long mine enemies
shall triumph over me:
49
Which is, thy Church desires to know
how long she shall abide,
Beset with cruel enemies
about on every side.
50
To whom thou have an answer made,
by Christ thy blessed son,
That still thy power with her shall be,
until the world be done.
51
And we her children thee desire,
to bring us to the end
Of this short time, that we with thee
may to the heavens ascend.
52
And til that time, good Lord vouchsafe
thou will continue still
Thy grace and favor toward us,
according to thy will:
53
And not to leave me any time
in middle of my days; Verse. 24. Nereuo^es me in dimidio dierum meorum.

But by thine aid bring all my time
to end, unto thy praise:
54
That after these my temporal days,
I may behold and see
Thine everlasting days and years, In generationem and generationem a^m tui.

which cannot numbered be,
55
For all times here do swiftly pass,
as time that is unsure;
But yet time of Eternity
for ever shall endure.
56
For why, o Lord, Eternity
is very substance thine;
Which substance who so seeks to know,
no reason can define.
The third part.
WIthout beginning, Lord, thou wast, Verse. 25. In initio tu domine terram
fundasti, and opera manuum tuarum sun^ coeli.

and yet beginning gave
To heaven and earth, and all therein,
which that creation have.
2
Thy hands them wrought, which is thy power
thy word them made also,
And at the last, They perish shall,
and motion theirs forgo. Verse. 26. Ipsi peribunt.

3
Their substance still they all shall keep,
yet all shall changed be;
For heaven and earth shall new be made,
of glory great to thee.
4
Likewise the bodies of all men
shall perish with the rest,
And in another sort shall rise,
to thee as seems best.
5
But thou, Lord, truly shall endure
in thy high glory great, Tu^utem permanes.

In majesty omnipotent,
sitting on mercy seat;
6
When all shall wax and wear away, Et omnes sicut vestimentum veterassen^:
and sicut^pertorium mutabis eos, and mutabuntur.

as garments old to see,
And as a vesture new put on,
we all shall changed be.
7
As garments to the body are
to cover them withal;
So be the bodies of the soul,
their vestures and their pall:
8
But thou art even the self same one* Verse. 27. Tu autem idemipse es.

which ever do abide,
That is to say, omnipotent,
and so is none beside.
9
Invisible thou art likewise,
immortal eke withal;
And as thy years shall never fail, Et anni tui non de^ici^ut.

so ever bide they shall:
10
So shall the souls of thine elect
immortallie remain,
In joy and great felicity,
not knowing any pain.
11
The souls of those that wicked are
immortal be also,
But they contraire shall endure
continual pain and woe.
12
And Lord, The sons of servants thine
together they shall dwell: Verse. 28. Filij seruorum tuoru^ ^^^itabunt: and
semen eorum in seculum di^igetur.

Likewise their seed shall in thy sight
still prosper and do well,
13
Thy servants, Lord, the prophets were
Apostles thine also,
From whom by faith we have received,
as we believe and know.
14
And now vouchsafe, most mighty God,
to send us of thy grace;
That in this life our faith by works
may shine in every place:
15
That they to all may signify
how we thy servants be,
And that both soul and body may
remain and rest with thee.
De profundis. Psalm. 130.
O God thou art the guide
of those that blinded be, Sing this to the tu^e of the 38. Psal^.

and unto (...) that are oppressed
a succor sweet we see.
2
A comfort to the weak,
as ease to those in pain,
A life unto the dead in grave,
that sleeping yet remain.
3
O Lord this makes me bold,
though wicked I be found,
And overwhelmed deep in sin,
and therein being dround,
4
To call and cry to thee,
from depth of misery,
Where none but thou can raise me up*
and safe deliver me.
5
I can but mourn and weep,
fetch sighs, lament and cry;
As does the woman great with child,
whose hour draws nie:
6
She no time can take rest,
till she delivered be;
Nor I, till that my conscience feel
to be forgiven of thee.
7
It is not distance long,
that keeps my prayers back;
Thou, Lord, do hear before we call,
and give what we lack.
8
Jonas was in the sea,
and in the fish three days,
And from the deep he called on thee,
and straight thou did him raise.
9
Out from the deep likewise, Verse. 1. De pro^undis clamaui ad te domine.

of sin and wickedness,
To thee I call; Lord hear my voice,
and free me from distress.
10
And let thine ears, Verse. 2. Domine exaudi votem meam. Fiant aures tuae
intendentes ad vocem deprecati^^^^ meae.
sweet Lord,
to hear attentive be;
The voice and prayer of my plaint,
that now I make to thee.
11
And since that Christ, thy son,
has suffered for us all,
From endless death, to which by sin
we bounden were and thrall;
12
Let not my sins then, Lord,
to me be stop or stay,
Whereby by plaint should not be heard,
nor voice when I shall pray:
13
But rather wipe away
my sins for evermore.
The burden of the which I feel
too grievous be and sore.
14
If thou, Lord, be extreme, Verse. 3. S^ iniquitates obseruaueris domine,
domine quis sustinebit?

to mark what sins be done,
Alas, no flesh shall saved be,
that is under the son.
15
O Lord, if that the just
shall no time able be,
To enter into judgment thine,
to plead his case with thee;
16
What shall become of me,
that daily do offend,
And of my sin and wickedness,
(alas) do know none end?
17
Most vile and wretched man,
and caitife woe forlorn,
What shall I do? but flee to thee
with heart beerent and torn.
18
For mercy is with thee, Verse. 4. Quia apud te propitiat^o est.

increasing more and more,
Wherewith thou did vouchsafe to come
mankind for to restore.
19
Wherein was satisfied
thy justice, and also
Thy mercy found that which it sought;
as we by grace do know.
20
How fervent was this love,
to which thou did us bind?
First by the law of nature writ Verse. 5. Et propte^ legem tua^ susti^^^ te
domine.

in every heart or mind,
21
And then by law, which was
in Tables written deep,
That every one according lie,
the same should hold and keep:
22
Which was, that one of us
should with the other bear,
And thereby to fulfill thy will,
with pity, love, and fear.
23
I knowing this, am glad,
contented eke withal,
For to remit such injuries,
as unto me may fall.
24
For why, good Lord, I know
thou do forgive to me,
Much more offenses every day
committed unto thee.
25
And when it shall thee please,
to scourge me for my sin;
I gladly shall the same receive,
knowing what I have bin:
26
And that thy chastisement
proceeds of very love;
Which all shall turn to me such wealth,
as no man can remove: Sustinuit (...) mea in (...).

27
Hoping, after this life,
my soul shall then obtain,
Which hope abides still in thy word,
an everlasting gain.
28
Such hope my soul has had, Verse. 6. Sperauit anima mea in do^^^.

by grace thou gave to me,
And by the same I firmly trust
my soul shall saved be.
29
The husbandman, through hope,
his ground does plough, and sow;
The same in hope does reap and thresh,
that gain thereby might grow:
30
Even so will I abide
in hope of glory thine,
Not only in my yough, o Lord,
or any pointed time:
31
But still from morning watch, A custodi^ matutin^ vsq* ad noct^m.

until the night of death,
Which is, from youth, unto mine age,
when life shall pass with breath.
32
Who so shall cast away
this hope, ere death proceed,
Shall loose the time he watched before,
and want thy help at need.
33
This hope in promise thine,
my soul has safely laid
Within the bosom of her breast,
for ever to be staid.
34
And very meet it is,
that Israel also, Verse. 7. Speret Israe^lin domino.

Which is all faithful Christians,
this hope should feel and know.
35
For blessed is the man,
that in the Lord does trust, Quia apud dominu^ misericord^^, and copiosa
apud^^um*

And who in man affiance puts,
he surely is accursed.
36
For mercy is with God,
and grace abundant store,
With which Israel is redeemed redemptio. verse. 8. Et ipse redemit Israel ex
omnibus iniquitatibus eius. Sing this to the tune of the Creed Quic^^que ^ul^.

from sin for evermore: Amen.
Domine exaudi. Psalm. 143.
The first part.
O Lord, long time I wandered have,
and gone from thee astraie,
And lost the portion y^ me gave,
in wastfull sinners way:
2
With grace thou did replenish me,
therewith to follow thee;
But Just and liking of the flesh
has driven the same from me,
3
So that unworthy far I am,
for to be called thy son;
My wickedness so soul appeeres,
and faults that I have done:
4
Yet with the wastfull child, o^ Lord,
I do my self accuse; verse. 1. Domine exaudi orationem mea^, auribus percipe
obsecrationem meam, and in ver^tate tua exaudi me.

And am with shame surpised and caught
I did my self abuse;
5
Wherefore Lord, ponder my desire,
and hear me when I pray,
And for thy truth and righteousness
attend to that I say.
6
Thou have with gifts endued me,
of body and of mind,
And I the same abused have,
and showed my self unkind.
7
Thy justice still does threaten me
with everlasting pain,
Thy mercy yet does promise me,
to be restord again.
8
Enter not into judgment then, Verse. 2. Et non intres in iudicium cum seruo
tuo: quia non iustificabitur in conspectu tu^ omnis viuens.

with me, I humbly pray:
For in thy sight no man is just,
as of himself to say.
9
We all by sin our selves have made,
more loathsome than the swine,
And fowler to be looked on,
were not for mercy thine;
10
Which shall us make like to the wool
in color fair and white,
When all our sins thou shall forget,
and clean put from thy sight. Verse. 3. Quia per secutus est inimicus animam
meam humiliauit in terra vitam meam: collocauit me in obscuris, sicut mortuos
seculi.

11
But yet the devil, mine enemy
my soul pursues still,
And has brought low my life in earth,
a servant to his will;
12
And with his net me compast round,
where vain delights do dwell,
Where lust unclean and wickedness
to bide does me compel.
13
He has me set in darkness such,
as men that no life have,
Or as those people being dead,
or covered in the grave. Verse. 4. Et anxiatus est super me spiritus meus in
me, turbatum est cor meum.

14
Now, Lord, My spirit so vexed is,
my heart is grieved also,
My conscience likewise witness bears
of anguish mine and woe.
15
My wisdom, Lord, confused is
by reason of my sin,
Repentance great my heart does rent,
to think what I have bin.
16
I call to mind the days of old, Verse. 5. Memor sum dierum antiquorum,
meditatus sum in omnibus operibus tu^^ in factis manuum ^ua^um medit abor.

and works that thou have wrought,
The marvelous deeds thy hands have done,
I muse on in my thought.
17
As in the time of Moses law,
where mercy was not shown,
And he that did the same transgress,
by death was overthrown:
18
Yet in this hard and severe time,
thy mercy forth was sent,
By prophets thine, with promise made,
to all that did repent.
19
If thou in time of cruelty
could then such mercy show,
Much more, o Lord, in time of grace
on me thy mercy throw.
20
I have spread forth my hands to thee, Verse. 6. Expandi manus meas adce, anim^
mea sicut terra sine ^qu^.

my soul for help does cry,
As from the earth, that moisture wants,
where water none does lie:
21
That is, my life I changed have,
from vain delights that be,
And have my soul spread forth at large,
that thou her filth might see.
22
For as the earth that moisture wants,
must barren be by kind;
So if my soul be void of grace,
no good is there to find:
23
But yet through moisture of that grace
from thee that does proceed,
Vouchsafe I may thy mercy have,
and that, o Lord, with speed.
24
Hear me, o Lord, and that right soon, Verse. 7. Velociter exaudi me domine,
defecit spiritus meus.

for why my spirit is weak,
And feeble made; much like a man
that wants power to speak.
25
The fear is such that I possess,
I ready am to fall,
The strength wherewith my body lives
is gone away with all.
26
This fear of endless punishment,
which I deserved have,
Had well nie brought me in despair,
or I possess the grave.
The second part.
GOod Lord turn not thy face away, Non auertas faciem tuam a me, ne similis
ero descendentibus in la^ura.

least I be like to those
That do descend into the pit,
where naught but horror grows.
2
Thou will not, Lord, the death of him
that has offended thee;
But rather that he should return,
and saved so to be.
3
Thou art the true and only God,
the Savior of mankind;
Without thee there is nothing else
that we shall mercy find.
4
Then turn to me thy countenance,
of amiable grace,
And let thy mercy shadow me,
while life I have and space:
5
And lay not to my charge, good Lord,
the sins that I have done;
But them forget, and me forgive,
for Christ's sake thy son.
6
And cause thy mercy to be heard, Verse. 8. Auditam faec mihi mane
misericordiam tuam, quia in te speraui.

of me before the prime;
For I in thee have put my trust,
alone from time to time.
7
Most blessed Lord, grant that I may
thy mercy sweet obtain,
And that right soon thou me release
from my deserved pain.
8
With great repentance do I call,
my hope assures me,
Thou will forgive me all my sins,
because I trust in thee.
9
I know that thou art nigh to all
that call upon thy name,
And wilt direct their steps aright,
that crave of thee the same. Nota^ ^^c mihi viam in qua ambulem; quiae ad te
leuaui animam meam.

10
Wherefore, good Lord, show me the way
I ought for to walk in,
For I my soul have lifted up
to thee with all my sin.
11
Lord, many times indeed thou have
directed me the way,
And I have purposed in my self
no more to go astraie:
12
Yea, when I have repentant bin,
and vowed in my heart
Thy law for to observe and keep,
and never to depart;
13
The devil my deadly enemy
contrived the matter so,
But his deceit, ere I was ware,
gave me the overthrow:
14
And, Lord, without assistance thine,
he vanquish will ere long,
All the kingdoms upon the earth, Verse. 9. Eripe me de inimicis meis, domine
ad te confugi.

he is become so strong.
15
Deliver me from all my foes;
for unto thee I fly,
And give me strength, my God, to do
thy will effectually.
16
For of my self no power I have Verse. 10. Doce me facere voluntatem tuam,
quia deus meus es it is.

to do the good I should,
Ne for to wish or think the good
that very feign I would.
17
Thy mercy only, Lord, it is
by which I must prevail;
For man without thy help and aid,
of purpose needs must fail.
18
Thou have with reason and with will
endued me, I know;
But will (of force) without thy grace
must reason overthrow.
19
Wherefore, Spiritus bonus deducet me in terram rectam.
Lord, let thy holy spirit
conduct me in the way,
Unto the land of righteousness,
I thee beseech and pray:
20
Where thine elect and chosen sort
thy brightness shall behold,
With such heavenly felicity
as cannot here be told;
21
Not that I have deserved, Lord,
for to possess the same;
But for thine endless mercies sake,
and for thy holiename. Verse. 11. Propter nomen tu^m domine.

22
Thou will not Lord, the death of him
that daily does offend:
But that he rather do convert,
and so his life amend:
23
This is thy will, this is thy mind,
though I a sinner be;
If by repentance I do turn,
then will thou turn to me:
24
And then shall I received be,
and be revived again; Viui^icabis me in aequitate tua.

And through thy equity be freed
of everlasting pain.
25
For whereas I by sin am dead
spirituallie to say,
I shall be think me of the same,
and for thy mercy pray.
26
My body now by nature weak,
shall then in strength arise,
And shall in glory shine more bright,
than does the sun in skies.
27
Where now, the same, a Lord, is given
to lust and lewd delight,
Shall then arise all spiritual,
and yield to reasons might.
28
No grosenesse then, but that it may
pearse through the thickest stone;
And as for things corruptible,
it shall have mind of none.
29
Immortal it shall ever be, Et duces de tribulatione animam meam.

impassible withal,
Between the body and the soul
shall then no strife befall.
30
Thus, Verse. 12. Et in musericordia tua disperdes inimicos meos.
Lord, Thou shall bring forth my soul
from troubles all that be,
And shall mine enemies destroy,
through mercy showed to me.
31
Thou shall them utterly confound,
that do my soul molest; Et perdes omnes qui tribulant animam meam, quon^am
ego seruus tuus sum.

For I by grace thy servant am,
and in thy mercy rest.
32
Good Christ, which gave thy life for me
and suffredst on the tree:
Preserve my body and my soul,
and mercy have on me, Amen.

Certain short and pithy Prayers unto Jesus Christ our Savior.
The day shall come (says Christ)
and that shall many see;
Who calls upon my name,
shall surely saved be.
^ O IESV meek, o IESV sweet,
^ o IESV savior mine, most gracious
^ IESV to my call thy gracious ears
^ incline.
I know, good IESV, ere I speak,
thou know what I would have:
Jesus, thy grace I know it is,
that bids me mercy crave.
O Jesus dear, whose precious blood,
was shed on cross of tree,
Sweet Jesus, for thy passion sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus sweet, grant that thy grace
always so work in me,
I may desire the thing to do,
most pleasing unto thee.
O Jesus meek, thy will be mine,
my will be thine also:
And that my will may follow thine,
in pleasure pain and woe.
O Jesus, what is good for me,
is ay best known to thee:
Therefore according to thy will,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus dear, do thou with me,
even as thy will shall please,
Sweet Jesus, put me where thou will
to suffer pain or ease.
Jesus behold, I am but thine,
where I be good or ill:
Ye^ by thy grace I ready am,
thy pleasure to fulfill.
Jesus, I am thy workmanship,
most blessed may thou be:
Sweet Jesus, for thy mercy sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus meek, grant that I may
repose my trust in thee:
For thou, sweet Jesus, art the peace,
and true tranquillity.
Thou Jesus, art the very peace,
and quietness of mind;
The only rest unto the soul,
that shall thy favor find.
Wherefore sweet Jesus do vouchsafe,
my soul this peace may see:
And for thy painful passion sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus, if thou do withdraw
thy comfort for a time,
Let not despair take hold on me,
for any sinful crime;
But give me patience to abide
thy pleasure and thy will:
For sure thy judgments all are right,
though I be wicked still.
But yet a promise have thou made,
to all that trust in thee:
According to which promise Lord,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus dear, give me that grace,
I gladly suffer may,
What ever so thy pleasure be
upon me for to lay.
O Jesus meek, what thanks ought I
to give unto thy name,
Which for my sins to set me free,
have suffered death and shame?
O Jesus sweet, my wickedness
I do confess to thee;
Wherefore, as thou have promised,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus sweet, a little thing
sometime does vex me sore,
And makes me slow to give thee thanks
ah! woe is me therefore.
Jesus, again sometime I think,
still strongly for to stand:
But when a little trouble coms,
I straight fall under hand.
Thus I susee, a small thing makes
temptation great to be:
My weakness Jesus do behold,
and mercy have on me: Amen.
O Jesus Christ, in all things now
assist me with thy grace:
And make me strong with heavenly strength
while life I have and space.
Jesus let not mine enemy
the feend, ne yet the flesh
Prevail, though still they me assail
from day to day afresh.
But Jesus, strengthen thou my spirit,
it may the victor be,
And for thy tender mercy sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus, who shall give me wings
of perfect peace and love,
That I therewith from hence may flee,
and rest with thee above?
O Jesus, when shall I ascend,
and feel how sweet thou art,
And leave the earth, and love thee best,
with all my soul and heart?
Sweet Jesus, when thy pleasure is,
the time is known to thee:
Both now and then o Jesus dear,
have mercy Lord on me: Amen.
O Jesus, king of glory great,
the comfort of us all;
We wander here in wilderness,
and every day do fall.
Sweet Jesus, come and visit me,
my heavy soul make glad,
Which now through sin in prison lies,
all heavy, sick, and sad.
Good Jesus, with thy presence set
my soul at liberty,
And for thy bitter passion sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus, often it greeueth me,
and troubles sore my mind,
That I so weak and frail am found,
to wander with the blind.
O Jesus dear, thou lasting light,
whose brightness does excel,
The clearnes of thy beams send down,
within my heart to dwell.
O Jesus, quicken thou my soul,
that it may cleave to thee,
And for thy painful passion sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus, grant I may resign
my self unto thy will,
And that I may my self forsake,
and cleave unto thee still.
O Jesus, grant that I may have
of joy and inward peace,
And of the pains I have deserved,
Good Jesus me release.
Sweet Jesus, give me inward joy,
my soul to feed on thee,
And for thy tender mercies sake,
have mercy Lord on me: Amen.
O Jesus sweet, I know I am,
but vanity and sin,
Unconstant as the wind that blows,
and ever so have bin.
Whereof then Jesus may I brag?
or what have I to say?
Shall I of men seek to be praised?
or yet extold for ay?
No Jesus sweet, the true praise is,
for to be praised of thee;
Wherefore, good Jesus, weigh my case,
and mercy have on me: Amen.
O Jesus, thou my glory art,
in thee will I rejoice,
And not, good Jesus, in my self,
nor yet in that man's voice,
That worldly honor may me give,
to set me up on hie:
To rule among the sons of men,
and sit in dignity.
These are but shadows to compare,
to glory that is with thee;
Sweet Jesus, for thy glory sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus, here in earth we live,
and soon deceived are
With vain delights ye world does yield;
wherein we run too far.
But yet, sweet Jesus, if I could
behold my self right well,
I should, good Jesus; plainly see,
and thereby truly tell,
The troubles that are fallen on me,
were for offending thee;
For which offense I pardon crave,
have mercy Lord on me: Amen.
O Jesus Christ, under whose power,
is both the sea and land:
Arise and help, me to defend,
by power of thy strong hand,
From such as lurk and lie in wait,
and seek to do me wrong:
Sweet Jesus, see how weak I am,
and how that they be strong.
Jesus, make have and come with speed,
my trust is all in thee,
And therefore Jesus, help me now,
and mercy have on me: Amen.
O Jesus, comfort mine exile,
assuage my dole and grief,
With thee to be is my desire,
mine only chief relief.
Jesus, the pleasures of this world,
they may not long endure;
And he that puts his trust therein,
shall find them all unsure.
Sweet Jesus, grant that I may have
mine only joy in thee;
And for thy bloody passion sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus Christ, that have me made,
and with thy blood me bought:
Suffer me not to be condemned,
whom thou have made of naught.
O Jesus mild, in time of need
thy mercy do bestow,
And in thy justice judge me not,
nor do thy rigor show.
O Jesus, in extremity,
I do appeal to thee;
Wherefore since that I trust in thee,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus sweet, for heavenly things
I often seek to find,
But then affections of the world
do backward pluck my mind.
Again, I seek for to subdue
the affections that do rise,
But to my spirit they will not be
subject in any wise.
Thus Jesus meek, thou see I strive,
and all to be with thee,
Wherefore good Jesus make me strong,
and mercy have on me: Amen.
O Jesus, many times I pray,
and call upon thy name;
When that my heart is far away,
alas I more to blame.
And that good Jesus coms to mind,
that custom often brought,
Whereby the prayers that I make,
be vain and turn to naught.
Sweet Jesus, pardon and forgive,
when I so pray to thee,
And for thy endless mercy sake,
have mercy Lord on me: Amen.
O Jesus, be not long away,
nor in thy wrath depart,
But mortify that flesh desires,
and lighten thou my heart:
Send forth the burning flames of love,
clean to consume for ay;
The cloudie fancies of my mind,
which trouble me always.
Good Jesus, gather all the powers
of my poor soul to thee;
And make me to refuse the world,
and mercy have on me: Amen.
O Jesus mild, thine ear bow down,
and ponder my desire;
Deal not with me as I deserve,
to punish in thine ire:
But me defend, o Jesus meek,
through mercy great of thine,
From dangers such as may befall
this sinful soul of mine.
O Jesus, hide not now thy face,
from him that calls on thee;
But Jesus, for thy bitter death,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus sweet, with mercy now
reform that is amiss,
And with the strength of thy great grace,
send light where darkness is.
Good Jesus, from my secret faults,
do make me clean and bright,
And from presumptuous sins, o Lord,
defend me through thy might.
Good Jesus, cast my youthful sins
behind thy back to be;
And for thy tender mercy sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus, shut not up my soul
with those that run astraie,
But let the shadow of thy wings,
my soul protect alwaie.
Good Jesus, turn thee unto me,
and cleanse me from my sin,
Sweet Jesus Christ, do not behold,
how wicked I have bin:
But think upon thy mercies great,
though I unworthy be;
And for thy pain^full passion sake,
have mercy now on me: Amen.
O Jesus sweet, give me an heart,
that is contrite and pure,
A body chaste, that humble is,
and constant to endure.
A mind that is with heavenly ioies
replete through thy great grace,
A soul likewise to magnify
thy praise in every place.
O Jesus, for thy mercy sake,
let these proceed from thee;
And then no doubt I shall be sure,
thou mercy have on me: Amen.
Certain blessings promised by God unto all those that do love and fear him.
Deuteronomy 28.
WHo hearkens to the voice of God,
and does his law fulfill,
Shall blessed be in town and field,
with mercy and good will.
His fruit likewise shall blessed be,
that from his lo^^es shall spring,
His corn and cattle shall increase,
with plenty of all thing.
His oxen and his flocks of sheep,
shall blessed be with store,
His going out, and coming in,
shall blessed be evermore.
His enemies that shall arise,
shall fall before his face,
And flee for fear, as does the beast
the hunter has in chase.
His houses that be made for store,
with great increase shall grow:
And every thing he takes in hand,
shall blessed be also.
Vou^hsafe, good God, to give me grace,
so to direct my mind,
As by the same in time of need,
I may thy blessing find: Amen,
A meditation when ye go to bed.
O Lord my God, I wandered have,
as one that runs astray,
And have in thought, in word, in deed,
in idleness and play,
Offended sore thy Majesty,
in heaping sin to sin,
And yet thy mercy has me sparde,
so gracious have thou bin.
O Lord, my faults I now confess,
and sorry am therefore,
But not so much as saine I would,
o Lord, what will thou more?
It is thy grace must bring that spirit,
for which I humbly pray,
And that this night thou me defend,
as thou have done this day:
And grant when these mine eyes and tongue
shall fail through natures might,
That then the powers of my poor soul,
may praise thee day and night: Amen.
A meditation at your vprising.
O Lord, this night who have me kept
from dangers all that be,
And have me given of rest and sleep,
so much as pleases thee:
Where other of my brethren poor,
of better life than I,
Do wander up and down the streets,
and harbourlesse do lie.
And some with sickness are oppressed,
some impotent and lame:
Thus do thou deal with creatures thine
to glory of thy name.
O Lord, in sort as I deserve,
thou have not dealt with me;
But have me given wherewith to live,
in better case to be.
Most mighty God, this day likewise
protect me from all blame,
And give me grace, I thankful be,
with praises for the same: Amen.
Athanasius his Creed, commonly called, Quicunque vult.
By faith we please the Lord,
By faith we are set free,
By faith we work the will of God,
Faith will not idle be.
^ What man is he will saved be, must
^ first the true faith have: Which faith
^ unless he hold and keep, his soul
^ God will not save. And this is now
^ the perfect faith, to worship God in
^ three: The Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
^ all three in Unity.
The persons neither to confound,
nor substance to divide:
For he that so shall think of them,
from perfect faith is wide.
For of the Father, of the Son,
and of the holy Ghost:
Be persons three in several,
and all in might be most.
The Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
in Godhead equal be:
In glory like, and so in might,
and so in Majesty.
Such as the heavenly Father is,
such is the Son also:
Such is likewise the holy Ghost,
all three one God, no mo.
The Father was uncreated,
so was the Son likewise:
The holy Ghost uncreated,
still one for to devise.
The Father without number is,
none may him comprehend:
The Son likewise, and holy Ghost,
all three one without end.
The Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
eternal do endure:
And yet not three eternals be,
but one eternal sure.
Not three, that number do exceed,
nor three unmade certain:
But three in one, and one in three,
for ever do remain.
The Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
omnipotent be all:
And yet not three omnipotents,
but one believe we shall.
The Father God, the Son is God,
the holy Ghost also:
And yet three Gods we shall not say,
of Gods but one, no mo.
The Father Lord, the Son is Lord,
and holy Ghost is Lord:
Yet not three Lords, but one in three,
and three in one accord.
For like as we compelled be,
by Christian verity,
Each person of them to confess,
both God and Lord to be:
So are we by the same forbid,
in any wise to say,
Three Gods to be, or yet three Lords,
but three in one alwaie.
The Father is not created,
begot, nor made of none:
The Son ne made nor created,
begot of him alone.
The holy Ghost is from them both,
ne made, create, nor got;
But from the father and the son
proceeding had, we wot.
So then there is of fathers one,
not fathers three, we see:
One son, not three: and so likewise,
one holy Ghost to be.
And in this holy Trinity,
is none more great than other:
But that the whole three persons be
coequall altogether.
So that in all, as foresaid is,
the Unity in three,
And Trinity in Unity,
ought worshipped to be.
Yet furthermore, it needful is
unto salvation,
That we believe of lesus Christ
the incarnation.
The right faith is, that we believe,
and with one mouth foorth-show,
That Jesus Christ the son of God,
is God and man also.
God of his Father substance is,
begot ere world was wrought,
And man, by flesh and blood he took,
of her who forth him brought.
Both perfect God, and perfect Man,
is he without dividing:
And of a reasonable soul,
and humane flesh abiding.
He to the Father equal is,
touching his Deity:
But he is less than Father is,
by his humanity.
Who though he be both God and man,
yet one is he, not twain:
That is to say, one Jesus Christ,
for ever to remain.
One, not by turning Godhead his
into the flesh we see:
But taking manhood into God,
by power of Deity.
One, yet not by confusion
of this his substance sure:
But by Unity of person,
which ever shall endure.
For as the reasonable soul
and flesh one man does make:
So God and man is but one Christ,
which suffered for our sake.
And then descended into hell,
the third day rose again:
From death to life, thus has he done,
mankind to rid from pain.
And after this ascended he
^ unto the heavens on hie:
And on his Fathers right hand sits,
one God etern^llie.
From thence he shall come down again
a rightful judge to be:
To judge the living and the dead,
as he their woorks shall see.
At whose descending all shall rise,
in twinkling of an eye:
And with this flesh shall him behold,
in throne of Majesty.
Then they that have done righteouslie,
shall heaven have for their hire:
And they that have done wickedlie,
have everlasting fire.
This is the true and perfect faith,
all Christians ought to have:
Which faith unless we do believe,
our souls God will not save.
Praise we these persons three in one,
and likewise one in three:
As from the first has bin, now is,
and evermore shall be: Amen.
A meditation to be said of women with child.
In time of trouble call on me,
and I will then deliver thee.
THe time draws nie,
of bitter painful throws,
How long I shall
the same endure, God knows.
O Lord my God,
I humbly ask of thee,
Make haste sweet Christ,
and safe deliver me.
Although by sin
deserved I have right well,
Such pain as this,
yea more than tongue can tell:
Yet ah! my God,
turn not away thy face,
Nor me forsake,
in this so sharp a case.
This womb, and fruit
that springs in the same,
Have thou create,
to glory of thy name.
Oppressed with pain,
o Lord when I shall be,
Make less the same,
so much as pleases thee.
And grant good God,
thy creature may proceed,
Safely on live,
with mercy at my need.
In Christ's name,
I will my travel show:
Now holy Ghost,
come comfort me in woe.
Come father dear,
and let thy power descend:
O Jesus Christ,
thy mercies great extend.
Ah God! behold
my dolor and my smart;
Sweet holy Ghost,
my comforter thou art:
Take part with me,
and hear my woeful cry:
Exaudi me,
miserere mei: Amen.
A meditation to be delivered from Sin.
O Lord my God,
I humbly beseech thee,
And Jesus Christ,
thine equal in Deity,
With holy Ghost,
of like power in majesty,
And three in one,
and likewise one in three,
Which is to say,
one blessed Trinity:
Grant that the power
of thy Divinity,
May in this life
always deliver me,
From fornication,
and adultery,
From wicked sort
of unclean company:
From sudden death,
and cursed blasphemy:
From vaineglorie,
and hypocrisy:
From malice, hatred,
and cruelty:
From the detestable
and great enormitie
Of sedition and
priure conspiracy:
From all false doctrine
and heresy:
From pride in heart
and vanity;
From pestilence, famine,
and bloudthirstie:
From just desert
of slander and infamy:
From filtie sin,
and vile iniquity.
And when as I
upon thy name shall cry;
Hear my request,
and grant me thy mercy: Amen.
A prayer for the Queens most excellent Majesty.
O King of heaven, of earth, of sea,
and all things else beside,
Under whose power, and in whose hands
the hearts of Kings abide;
Vouchsafe to guide our gracious Queen
Elizabeth aright,
That she in peace with health may reign
and govern through thy might;
And when thy godly will shall be
to end her living days;
Her soul may then with angels thine,
sound forth thine endless praise: Amen.
A thanksgiving before meat.
FOR fo^^ such as we find,
Let us give thanks therefore,
And not forget the poor to feed,
with some part of our store.
Let all our talk be such,
whereby no grudge may grow,
Ourselves well easd, and God best pleased,
Christ grant it may be so.
God long preserve in peace and health,
Our gracious Queen Elizabeth: Amen.
A thanksgiving after meat.
THou God be praised for the food,
we have received from thee;
And give us grace a life to lead,
More thankful for to be:
Lord long preserve in peace and health,
Our gracious Queen Elizabeth: Amen.

The poor Widows Mite. Gathered by William Hunnis, one of the Gentlemen of
her Highness Chapel, and Master to the Children of the same.

Who knocks with hope, and craves in faith, shall have their just request;
By love who seeks, the way shall find to port of quiet rest.
Newly printed by Henry Denham. 1583.



To the Queens Majesty's Highness.
E Except your Highness well allow
this gift of humble mind,
L Lack shall my hope the gladsome fruit,
it sought thereby to find.
I If gift with giuers loiall heart
your Majesty will try,
Z Zeal more than gift shall triumph then
before your Princely eye.
A A Persian prince, in gracious part,
took water of the well,
B Because he saw the giuers zeal,
the giuers gift excel:
E Even so my zeal, renowned Queen,
equivalent is with his,
Th. Though I offense commit, to give
so slender gift as this.
R Remembering yet your Princely wont,
of clemency withal:
E Example such has boldned me,
upon my knee to fall.
G Great gifts of gold, and gems of price,
poor Hunnis would present,
I If he them had: in stead whereof
he prays this may content.
N New year, and many, God you send,
in health with peace to reign,
A And after when your spirit departs,
with Christ it may remain.
Your Highness loiall subject and humble obedient servant. W. H.
The Author.
W WHo seeks with works alone to win
the life that shall remain,
I Is far deceived: for ift be so,
then Christ has did in vain.
LL Let our good woorks our faith declare,
by faith we are made free,
I It coms from God, that goodness is,
no good at all in me.
A As man himself unable is,
in thought to please the Lord,
M Much less to work or do the deed,
that might his health accord.
H Here I profess one God to serve,
from secret search of heart,
V Unto his sacred word to cleave,
and never to depart.
N No time my Prince nor Magistrate,
by will for to offend,
N Ne wish I worse unto my fo,
than to my very friend.
I In Christ by faith, by no means else,
my righteousness does flow:
S Such was his love, such is my faith,
and ever shall be so.
The Poor widows Mite.
The first Meditation.
^ Ah helples wretch! what shall I
^ do? or which way shall I run?
^ The earth bewrais, and heaven records
^ the sins that I have done.
The gates of hell wide open stand,
for to receive me in,
And fearful feends all ready be,
to torment me for sin.
Alas, where shall I succor find?
the earth does me deny,
And to the sacred heavens above,
I dare not lift mine eye.
If heaven and earth shall witness be,
against my soul for sin,
Untimely birth (alas) for me
much better then had bin.
And now despair approaches fast,
with bloody murdering knife,
And wills me to end my greefes,
by shortning of my life.
Shall I despair? Thou God forbid,
for mercy more is thine,
Than if the sins of all the world
were linked now with mine.
Despise not then, most loving Lord,
the image of thy face,
Which thou have wrought and dearly bought
with goodness of thy grace.
And since thy bloody price is paid,
and bitter pains all past;
Receive my plaints, accept my spirit,
and mercy grant at last:
^ So shall my soul rejoice, rejoice,
^ and still for mercy cry, Peccaui,
^ Pecca -- ui, Miserere mei.
The.2. Meditation.
THou God that rulst and rainst in light
that flesh cannot attain;
Thou God, that know the thoughts of men
are altogether vain;
Thou God, whom neither tongue of man
nor angel can express:
Thou God it is that I do seek,
thou pity my distress.
Thy seat, o God, is euerie-where,
thy power all powers extend,
Thy wisdom cannot measured be,
for that it has no end.
Thou art the power and wisdom too,
and sole felicity,
But I a lump of sinful flesh,
nurse of iniquity.
Thou art by nature merciful,
and Mercy is thy name,
And I by nature miserable,
the thrall of sin and shame.
Then let thy nature, o good God,
now work his force in me,
And cleanse the nature of my sin,
and heal my misery.
One depth, good Lord, and other craves;
my depth of sinful crime,
Requires thy depth of mercy great,
for saving health in time.
Sweet Christ grant y^ thy depth of grace,
may swallowe up my sin,
That I thereby may whiter be,
than ever snow has bin:
So shall my soul rejoice, Sing those four lines to e^erie meditation
following.
rejoice, and still for mercy cry, Peccaui, peccaui, miserere mei.

The.3. Meditation.
BEfore thy face, and in thy sight,
have I, deuoid of shame,
O Lord, transgressed willingly,
I do confess the same:
Yet was I loath that men should know,
or understand my fall,
Thus feared I man, much more than thee,
thou righteous judge of all.
So blind was I and ignorant,
yea rather wilful blind,
That sucked the comb, and knew the Be
had left her sting behind.
My sins, o God, to thee are known,
there is no secret place,
Where I may hide my self, or them,
from presence of thy face.
Where shall I then my self bestow?
or who shall me defend?
None is so loving as my God;
thy mercies have no end?
In deed I grant, and do confess,
my sins so heinous be,
As mercy none at all deserves:
but yet thy property
Is always to be merciful,
to sinners in distress;
Whereby thou will declare and show
thy great almightinesse.
Have mercy Lord on me therefore,
for thy great mercies sake,
Which camst not righteous men to call,
but sinners part to take:
So shall my soul rejoice, rejoice, and still for mercy cry, Peccaui,
peccaui, miserere mei.

The.4. Meditation.
MOst gracious God, do not behold,
the number of my sin,
Ne yet consider with thy self
how wicked I have bin;
But rather think I am but dust,
or as the withered hay,
Which flourishes to day in field,
tomorrowe shorn away.
My flesh rebels against the spirit,
my spirit too weak is found,
By sin conceived in mothers womb,
my soul first caught hit wound.
My flesh is frail, too weak and vain,
to do the thing I should,
And what I would not, that do I,
contrary that I would.
Thou see, o Lord, how w^ake I am,
not able for to stand
Without the succor, help and aid
of thy most mighty hand.
And what is he, that will not stay
the man that is like to fall?
Or will refuse the sick to help,
for help when he does call?
If thou will lay unto my charge,
the burden of my sin;
O Lord, the conquest is but small,
that thou thereby shall win.
For why, they glory and thy praise,
in mercy does consist,
Unto the which I yield my self,
to do with what thou list:
My soul shall trust in thee, in thee, and still for mercy cry, Peccaui
peccaui, miserere mei,

The.5. Meditation.
IF I demand what mercy is?
thou God wilt answer me,
That mercy is the abundance great
of thy divine pi^ie;
Wherewith thou vew'st the afflicted sort,
that on the earth do lie:
And what is this compassion then,
but proofs of thy mercy?
Our fathers old the same have felt,
and now in rest do reign,
And thou are still the selfsame God.
for ever to remain.
Our fathers were conceived in sin,
and so are we likewise;
Will thou compassion show on them,
and children theirs despise?
One faith in Christ we all profess,
one God in persons three,
As thou compassion had on them,
compassion have on me.
Ponder, o God, my hearts desire,
most humbly do I crave;
And do away all my misdeeds,
and so compassion have.
And as of sinners many a one,
whose number is unknown,
Thou did vouchsafe to draw to thee,
and make them all thine own:
So now vouchsafe, most gentle God,
likewise to draw me in,
And make me righteous by thy grace,
forgiving me my sin.
So shall my soul rejoice, rejoice, and still for mercy cry, Peccaui,
peccaui, miserere mei.

The.6. Meditation.
MOst mighty God, I do confess,
ten thousand times and more,
Thou have me washed from my sin,
and salued still my sore:
But I through sin am fallen again,
and fowler now am made,
Than ever was the filthy swine
with mier ouerlade.
How oftentimes shall we forgive,
each other that offend?
Seventy times seven, the scripture says,
which signifies no end.
If man to man such favor show,
that wretched caitiues be,
How much more thou, o gracious God,
to them that call on thee?
It is thy nature to forgive,
my nature can but fall;
Though thou be just in all thy works,
thy mercy passes all.
What time a sinner does repent,
and turn to thee at last,
All sins foredone thou will forget,
thy promise so has past.
Behold, o God, I turn to thee,
with sorrow for my sin,
And do repent even from my heart
that I so lewd have bin.
Now wash me, Lord, yet once ag^ine,
with fountain of thy grace,
That I among thy sacred Saints,
with thee might have a place:
So shall my soul rejoice, rejoice, and still for mercy cry, Peccaui,
peccaui, miserere mei.

The.7. Meditation.
LIke as the guilty prisoner stands,
before the judge so tried,
With quaking breath, and shiuering limbs,
his judgment to abide:
Even so, o God, before thy face
in fearful state I stand,
And guilty cry to thee my judge,
and now hold up my hand.
Nothing have I to plead for life,
no goodness is in me:
Of sin, deceit, and wickedness,
guilty, good Lord, guilty.
Thus by thy righteous doom, o God,
and sacred law divine,
Condemned am I to endless pain,
through just deserts of mine.
Alas, what then is to be said?
or what is to be done?
For mercy yet will I appeal,
to Jesus Christ thy son.
For never yet has it been heard,
since first the world began,
That Jesus Christ did turn his face,
from ani^ sinful man;
Which unto him for mercy came,
with sad repentant mind:
O Lord, shall I then be the first
that shall no mercy find?
Shall I be he, thou will despise,
that humbly comes to thee?
No no, sweet Christ, thy promise is
for to deliver me:
Wherefore my soul be glad, be glad, and cry incessantly, Peccaui, peccaui,
miserere mei.

Verses upon the Lords Prayer.
Our father, which art in heaven.
^ A thing thou art from which al things
^ beginning took their name, And thou
^ without beginning art, that gave all
^ things the same. We call thee God,
^ some Jehovah, some Tetragrammaton:
^ By all thy names thou art the thing,
^ we all depend upon.
We be thy sons, thy children dear,
and heirs of kingdom thine,
By which we do presume and say,
Our father most divine,
Which art in heaven, deuoid of shape,
that reason can devise,
Ne yet art thou there to be felt,
or seen of humane ^ies.
Hallowed be thy name.
THy name, o God, is wonderful,
though we the same abuse,
And by thy name such things are done,
as make the mind to muse.
The heavens above, the earth below,
and waters under them,
Thy name has wrought miraculouslie,
all for the use of men.
O marvelous God! what is thy name?
or what shall I thee call?
Thou art in power omnipotent,
the mightiest power of all.
Then mighty Power of powers it is,
vouchsafe the same in me,
So work thy will, that in my life
thy name may hallowed be.
Thy kingdom come.
THy kingdom everlasting is,
in truth and equity,
In favor, love, and righteousness,
to all in misery.
Bow down thy heavens, o mighty king,
whereby thy grace may fall;
That this thy kingdom might descend,
into the hearts of all.
So shall our sins be driven away,
our flesh made tame also,
And we found righteous in thy sight,
a perfect life to show.
Vouchsafe to grant, o heavenly king,
this blessed work may be,
Thy kingdom still to dwell in us,
and we to dwell in thee.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
THy will is good, our will is naught,
thy will be therefore done:
Such was thy will, that Jesus Christ,
thy dear and only son,
Should teach thy will to sinful flesh,
our wicked lusts to kill;
And he thy will upon the cross,
the same did there fulfill.
O heavenly father, let thy will
in earth fulfilled be,
Among us men, as with thy Saints
in heavenly Hierarchy.
And grant thy will so work in us,
that we thy will confess,
In word, in life, in faith, in love,
and perfect holiness.
Give us this day our daily bread.
THy word, thy truth, and Christ thy son,
is bread that we should have;
Vouchsafe our souls may feed thereon,
most humbly we do crave.
For man does not by bread alone
pass forth his vital days,
But by each word thy mouth proceeds
unto thy endless praise.
Sink in our hearts, thy sweet sons death
and such impression make,
As we thereby may cheerful be,
to suffer for his sake
Such cross as pleases thee to lay
upon our backs to bear;
With shield of faith to bide the brunt,
against all worldly fear.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.
WE know, forgiveness is at hand,
when we for mercy call;
If we each other do forgive,
thou will forgive us all.
Such promise have thou made, o God,
from which thou will not swerue,
And yet it lie not in our power,
the same for to deserve.
So weak is man, so feeble too,
not able once to mind
The thought that is good, or do the deed,
that might thy mercy find.
This will thy grace must work in us,
our brethren to forgive,
Which grant, o God, that we therewith,
in rest with thee may live.
And lead us not into temptation.
ANd though temptations needful be
thy servants strength to try,
And that our sins and wickedness,
by faith away do fsie:
Yet Lord, thy grace the same does work
whereby we stiflie stand,
Against the world, the flesh, the devil,
winning the upper hand.
Thus of our selves (alas) too weak,
temptations aie too strong,
Thy grace it is must us defend,
else are we thrown along.
Grant when by sin through want of grace
great falls we do sustain,
That then thy grace might visit us,
and rear us up again.
But deliver us from evil.
FRom evil that we by sin deserve,
most mighty God defend,
And rid us free from filthy fall,
of miserable end.
Withhold thy severe punishment,
and let thine eye of grace,
Take view upon the afflicted sort,
and help our wretched ca^e.
From surging Seas of worldly waves,
wherewith we be oppressed,
Discharge and set our souls on shore,
in port of quiet rest.
So shall we then our prayers make,
with conscience safe and sound,
And by thy grace shall able be,
our en'mie to confound: Amen.
The Christian faith.
ONe God in persons three,
and three in Godhead one,
I do believe my saving health
does rest in him alone.
The first, the Father high,
Creator of us all,
The second is his only Son,
the Word whom scriptures call.
The third, the holy Ghost,
of both who does remain,
In mighty power and Deity,
coequall with the twain.
The word of love to us,
flesh void of sin became,
Of virgins womb by power divine,
most pure he took the same.
And then for sinful flesh,
his flesh was sacrifis'd,
By bitter, sharp, and shameful death,
as cruel Jews devised.
His flesh with whips was rent,
his head becrown'd with thorn,
His body naild on cross of tree,
his heart with spear was torn.
Thus all his blood he shed,
to death his life made thrall,
To pacify his fathers wrath,
procured by Adams fall.
He died, and was buried,
descended down to hell,
From death to life he rose again,
he loved us so well.
When forty days were come,
to heaven ascended he,
In sight from men of Galilie,
in faith to us that be.
From whence I do believe,
he shall again descend,
To judge all flesh, and of the world
to make a final end.
The dead from grave shall rise,
the quick shall changed be,
And every eye shall face to face
behold his Majesty.
By grace who has done well,
with him in heaven shall reign:
By sin who has done wickedlie,
in everlasting pain.

A Dialog between Christ and a Sinner.
CHRIST. ^ Arise from sin thou wicked man, before
^ the trump does sound: Least thou among
^ the guilty sort, a damned soul
^ be found. My sheep why do thou persecute?
^ my lambs why do thou kill?
^ My self why do thou cru -- ci -- fie,
^ and guiltles blood thus spill? Arise I
^ say, arise, arise.

SINNER. ^ What fearful thundering voice is this,
^ that sounds in mine ear: Which bids
^ me rise, and brings my soul, and all her
^ powers in fear?

CHRIST. ^ It is the voice of him thy judge, that shall
^ thy iudger be: Which bids thee rise
^ while sun does shine, that thou thy
^ self may see: For after sun be set in
^ shade, and darksome clouds appear:
^ Too late is then for to a -- rise, if thou arise
^ not here. Arise I say, arise, arise.

SINNER. ^ O Lord by grace I now behold, wherein
^ I did offend.

CHRIST. ^ What made thee thus against my saints,
^ such cruelty extend?

SINNER. ^ It was my fault through ignorance,
^ by which I might not choose.

CHRIST. ^ And yet I say thine ignorance, shall
^ not thy baults excuse.

SINNER. ^ By grace I am re -- pen -- tant made,
^ Will thou not mercy have?

CHRIST. ^ If thou by grace re -- pen -- tant be,
^ yet must thou mercy crave.

SINNER ^ O Lord blot out my fyl -- thie deeds,
^ and cleanse me from my sin:

CHRIST. ^ Arise and walk, thou art made clean,
^ as thou beleeu'st therein.

Another dialog between Christ and a Sinner, to be soong as the former.
CHRIST. AWake from sleep, and watch awhile,
prepare your selves to pray;
For I mine angel will send forth
to sound the judgment day,
That mine elect and chosen sort
might find my saying true:
How that the time I shorten will,
for them and not for you.
Awake I say, awake, awake.

SINNER. And yet, o Lord, the little whelps
would lick the crumbs that fall,
Thy chosen sort are very few;
but many do thou call.

CHRIST. I call to you that will not hear,
I stretch mine arms at large,
For to embrace such as do come,
and all your sins discharge.
Wherefore if you refuse to come,
I will you then forsake;
And to my feast will strangers call,
and them my children make:
Awake therefore, and rise from sleep,
awake, I say, awake, awake.

SINNER. Not so, good Lord, thy mercy far
above our sins abound.

CHRIST. And yet I will a iusticer
in justice mine be found.

SINNER. Thy promise is to pardon sin,
and therein art thou just.

CHRIST. Your sins repent, and pray therefore,
in vain is else your trust.

SINNER. O Lord thy grace must this perform,
or else it cannot be.

CHRIST. My grace you have, the same apply,
and blessed shall you be.

SINNER. Through this sweet grace, thy mercy Lord
we humbly do require.

CHRIST. By mercy mine I you forgive,
and grant this your desire.

AMEN.
An humble suit of a repentant sinner, for mercy.
^ Give ear, o Lord, to hear my
^ heavy careful cries: And let my
^ woeful plaints ascend, above the
^ starrie skies, And now receive the
^ soul, that puts his trust in thee: And
^ mercy grant to purge my sins,
^ mercy, good Lord, mercy.
My soul desires to drink,
from fountain of thy grace:
To slake this thirst, o God, vouchsafe,
and turn not of thy face.
But bow thy bending ear,
with mercy when I cry:
And pardon grant for sinful life,
mercy, good Lord mercy.
Behold at length, o Lord,
my sore repentant mind,
Which knocks with faith, and hopes thereby*
thy mercies great to find.
Thy promise thus has past,
from which I will not fly:
Who does repent trusting in thee,
shall taste of thy mercy.
Mercy, good Lord, mercy, mercy.
Another to the same effect.
^ Behold, o God, the wretched state,
^ my silly soul is in: How sore oppressed
^ and ouerchargde, with foul
^ and filthy sin. Behold likewise
^ the prison foul, I mean my baned
^ breast: Where wickedness and sin abounds,
^ and breeds my souls unrest.
Behold o God how often my soul,
does lift her self to thee:
As one in dungion dark and deep,
desiring light to see.
Behold also, how feign it would,
do that might please thy will:
But cruel sin with his affects,
do draw me backward still.
Behold, I do not that I would,
as law of thine requires,
But I do that I would not do,
contrary my desires.
Such is the working of the feend,
such be his wily ways,
With ^ust to set my heart on fire,
whereby my health decaies.
Such pleasant baits lays he abroad
with pois'ned hooks of sin,
And trains my senses all thereto,
and drownes my soul therein.
But mercy is with thee my God,
for such as mercy crave,
Among the which I humbly ask,
some mercy for to have.
For light offense thy mercy small,
may soon appease thine ire,
But mine offenses manifold,
thy mercies great desire.
And since by mercy I must win,
thy favor and thy grace,
From my misdeeds and sinful life,
with mercy turn thy face.
Another to the same purpose.
^ My soul o God, does now confess,
^ a wicked life long led in sin:
^ And how the same to thee is known,
^ ere that my lips to speak begin.
^ Such is the fruit, such is the tree,
^ with mercy Lord deliver me.
Shall I, o Lord, for this despair
of hope, of help, and health at last?
Or shall I think thou seek'st revenge,
upon my sinful life that is past?
No no, my faith does witness me,
Thy blood from sin has set me free.
AMEN.
A Lamentation touching the follies and vanities of our youth.
^ Alack when I look back, upon
^ my youth that is past, And deeply
^ ponder youths offense, and youths reward
^ at last: With sighs and sobs
^ I say; o God I not deny, my youth
^ with folly has deserved, with folly
^ for to die. But yet if ever sinful
^ man, might mer -- cie move to ruth,
^ Good Lord with mercy do forgive,
^ the follies of my youth.
In youth I rangde the fields,
where vices all did grow:
In youth I wanted grace,
such vice to overthrow.
In youth what I thought sweet,
most bitter now I find:
Thus has the follies of my youth,
with folly kept me blind.
Yet as the Eagle cast's her bill,
whereby her age renut'h:
So Lord with mercy do forgive,
the follies of my youth: Amen.
A psalm of reioising for the wonderful love of Christ, ratified by his
meritorious death and passion, for our spiritual redemption.
LEt us be glad and clap our hands,
with joy our souls to fill:
For Christ has paid the price of sin,
with mercy and good will.
By his good will he flesh became,
for sinful fleshes sake:
By his good will disdained not,
most shameful death to take.
By his good will his blood was spilt,
his body all to rent:
By his good will to save us all,
he therewith was content.
By his good will death has no power,
our sinful souls to kill:
For Christ has paid the price of sin,
with mercy and good will.
Since Christ so dearly loved us,
let us from sin refrain:
For Christ desires nothing else,
in lieu of all his pain.
And that we should each other love,
as he us loou'd before:
So shall his love abide in us,
and dwell for evermore.
Let then our love so dwell in him,
our wicked lusts to kill:
For Christ has paid the price of sin,
with mercy and good will.
AMEN.
A prayer for the good estate of Queen ELIZABETH.
THou God that guidst both heaven and earth,
on whom we all depend:
Preserve our Queen in perfect health,
and her from harm defend.
Conserve her life in peace to reign,
augment her ioies withal:
Increase her friends, maintain her cause,
and hear us when we call.
So shall all we that faithful be,
reioise and praise thy name:
O God, o Christ, o holy Ghost,
give ear and grant the same.
AMEN.
A Christian confession of and to the Trinity.


second person in Trinity; I do likewise believe, confess, and acknowledge
thee to be of the father, without beginning, before all worlds, neither made
nor created, but begotten, and art equal with the father in power, might,
glory, majesty, and deity, and to be as thy father is, the fountain and
wellspring of all wisdom, grace, and mercy.

O Thou God the holy Ghost, of time, and without end, in like power, might,
glory, majesty, and deity as is the father and the son, all three in one,
and one in three, one very GOD everlasting, not three Gods everlasting, of one
essence or being, ever perdurable or during, without measure, not changeable,
almighty, one substance, and in one nature simple.

did create (and that of nothing) the creature angelike, and the worldly
nature; and then you made man common to the first two natures: for man is of
body corporal, and of soul spiritual.

ALso I do believe, confess,



whole consent of you three in one, and one in three, and by the ouershadowing
of the holy Ghost, thou, o holy and most blessed son of God, did enter
into the womb of the most unspotted amongst women, the blessed virgin Marie,
in whom was no blemish of sin after the salutation of the angel Gabriel,
when she had by the working of the holy Ghost, answered these words of
meekness; Behold and see, I am the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me
according to thy word.

THus thou blessed son of less than the father, but yet equal with the
father touching thy deity or Godhead: as after thy most blessed nativity thou

ANd also thou did show thy

IT also well pleased thee to fulfill,



faith unto us that be; where thou do remain perfect GOD and perfect man,
sitting on the right hand of the father, from whence thou shall come and judge
both the living and the dead. By the dead I understand the body which is
mortal, and by the living I understand the soul which is spiritual and
immortal.

ANd also I acknowledge, confess, and the other upon thy left, where we shall
all receive our last and final judgment. The which judgment, o Lord, I do
most humbly beseech thee may be unto me, not after my sins and wickedness;
but according unto thy great and unspeakable mercies.

Grant this, o thou most holy and blessed father of heaven, which art with the
son, and with the holy Ghost, the worlds creator; and have mercy upon me,
have mercy upon me.

Grant this, o thou most holy and blessed Jesus, the only son of God, the
worlds Savior and redeemer; and have mercy upon me, have mercy upon me.

Grant this, o thou most blessed and holy Ghost, which art together with the
father and the son, the worlds comforter; and have mercy upon me, have
mercy upon me.

Grant this, o thou most holy, most blessed, most glorious and everlasting
Trinity; and have mercy upon me, have mercy upon me, have mercy upon me,
Amen.

A prayer for the Queens most excellent Majesty.
O Almighty and merciful GOD, creator and governor of all things, whose
strength is every where, and whose power is infinite; which as thou ever art
omnipotent, and in all thy works most gracious and over marvelous; so unto us
thy poor servants, grant we humbly beseech thee, that ELIZABETH our gracious
QVEENE, and next under thee here on earth our governor, may long live, and
lead a healthful, quiet, and peaceable life. And if, o Lord, at any time the
wicked, through malice shall conspire and gather themselves together against
thee, and her thine anointed; we heartily beseech thee, either with speed to
convert and turn their hearts, or overthrow their force, and bring their
devises to naught. And although, o Lord, that we, through our manifold sins
and wickedness, do not deserve to have so good and so excellent a Jewel to
rule and reign over us; yet, good Lord, we heartily pray thy divine majesty,
to behold the great and unspeakable miseries, which the loss of so precious a
Pearl may bring upon us and our posterity, and to auert the same. This, o
Lord, we do humbly crave of thee, that we may long time enioie her; or else
that we, who faithfully do love her, may with her be dissolved, according to
thy good will and gracious pleasure, Amen.

A prayer to be said of every true Christian before the receiving of the holy
Communion.
O Most sweet lover of al mankind, Lord and Savior Jesus, I humbly beseech thee
for thy bitter passion sake to remove from me pride, envy, and detraction, yea
wrath, malice and impatiencie, and all other sicknesses and diseases of the
soul. And plant, good Lord, in my heart and mind true meekness, charity,
patience, chastity, temperance, and modesty, with all such other virtues,
medicines, and preservatives unto the soul. And mortisie in me, good Lord, all
unclean motions, carnal desires, and inordinate affections: and revive in me
the love of virtues, and the perpetual exercises thereof; so that in this time
and all times I may woorthilie receive this holy and blessed sacrament, unto
thine honor and glory, and my souls endless joy and comfort.

O Lord, I know and do confess here before thy divine majesty, that I am
unworthy, and very much unworthy, and most unworthy, through my manifold
sins and wickedness to lick the crumbs that fall from thy table: but
notwithstanding I know as well again, and so do I in heart and mind
steadfastly believe, and the same do acknowledge in mouth and word, that thou
my Lord God art omnipotent and almighty, and so may by thy power infinite,
if it so please thy majesty to make me worthy and acceptable to sit at thy
table, and there to taste and feed of the most pure and heavenly viands: for
thou alone, o Lord, may and can justify a sinner, and of a vile, foul,
and filthy wretch, make a clean, white, and pleasant person.

Therefore gracious Lord, I beseech thy worthy majesty for thy almighty
power, which I firmly and steadfastly believe; and for thine infinite and
endless wisdom, which I boldly confess; and for thine excellent goodness
and truth, wherein I fully hope and trust; and for all this together as one:
frame me and make me worthy and acceptable unto thy godly presence, and
grant me forgiveness of all my sins, and the fervent flame of thy love, that
I may now at this time receive this holy sacrament with purity of heart, and
cleanesse of conscience, with spiritual gladness and heavenly joy.

O most merciful Savior Jesus, I humbly beseech thee, for this holy mystery
of thy blessed body and blood, wherewith we unworthy wretches be
continually fed, and daily washed, cleansed, sanctified, and made holy, and
so partakers of thy most high divinity: grant me, Lord, and give me the
precious garment of innocence, with such furniture of other ornaments thereunto
according, as best may please thy gracious goodness, wherewith I may (as in my
wedding vesture) in a good and clean conscience approach unto thy presence; so
that this celestial and heavenly sacrament received, may be unto me health
and salvation of soul and body, unto life everlasting, Amen.

A prayer to be said of every true Christian after the receiving of the holy
Communion.
IN most humble, most lowly, and most hearty manner, with most due reverence I
thank thee, good Lord, most holy father, and everlasting God, that by the
bounty of thy merciful grace would vouchsafe thus to refresh and feed my
soul through faith with the benefits of the death and passion of thy son our
Lord God, and Savior Jesus Christ. And I beseech thine infinite goodness, that
this the sacrament of thy death and passion, which I most unworthy wretch have
now received, come never hereafter in judgment and condemnation unto me for
mine euilles, merits, and deseruings; but rather, good Lord, it may come unto
the profit and comfort of my body, and unto the salvation of my soul unto the
life everlasting, Amen.

A godly prayer to be said before the preaching of the word.
NEither is he that planteth, neither he that waters any thing at al, but
thou o Lord, that give the increase. Increase we beseech thee the seed of thy
word, and cause it to fructisie an hundred fold. Open our eyes, that we may see
the wonderful things contained in thy law. Incline our hearts to thy
testimonies, and not unto vanities. Evermore be on our right hand, and perfect
the work that thou have begun among us. Bear our most gracious ELIZABETH in
thine own bosom, and set thine eyes always upon her for good: let the spirit
of knowledge and holiness remain in her ministers; bless her Councellers with
wisdom and discretion; her Nobles with fortitude and courage; her Judges with
justice and mercy; her Magistrates with diligence and faithfulness; her People
with fear and perfect obedience, that we may all with one mind and one mouth
say with the prophet; He that is mighty has done for us great things, and
holy is his name, Amen.

A prayer necessary to be said at all times.
O Bountiful IESV, o sweet savior, o Christ the Son of GOD, have pity upon
me, mercifully hear me, and despise not my prayers. Thou have created me of
nothing: thou have redeemed me from the bondage of sin, death, and hell,
neither with gold nor silver, but with thy most precious body once offered
upon the cross, and thine own blood shed once for all, for my ransom:
therefore cast me not away, whom thou by thy great wisdom have made;
despise me not, whom thou have redeemed with such a precious treasure: nor let
my wickedness destroy that which thy goodness has builded. Now whilst I
live, o Jesus, have mercy on me: for if I die out of thy favor, it will be
too late afterward to call for thy mercy. Whilst I have time to repent, look
upon me with thy merciful eyes, as thou did vouchsafe to look upon Peter
thine Apostle, that I may bewail my sinful life, obtain thy favor, and die
therein. I reknowledge, that if thou should deal with me according to very
justice, I have deserved everlasting death. Therefore I appeal to thy high
throne of mercy, trusting to obtain Gods favor, not for my merits, but for
thy merits, o Jesus, who have given thy self an acceptable sacrifice to thy
father, to appease his wrath, and to bring all sinners (truly repenting and
amending their evil life) into his favor again. Accept me, o Lord, among
the number of them that shall be saved. Forgive me my sins, give me grace
to lead a godly and innocent life, grant me thy heavenly wisdom, inspire my
heart with ^aith, hope, and charity; give me grace to be humble in prosperity,
patient in adversity, obedient to my rulers, faithful unto them that
trus^^^^^, dealing truly with all men, to live chastely in wedlock, to
abhor adultery, fornication, and all uncleanness: to do good after my power
unto all men, to hurt no man, that thy name may be glorified in me during this
present life, and that I afterward may obtain everlasting life, through thy
mercy, and the merits of thy passion, Amen.
