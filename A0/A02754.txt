Orders set down by the most Reverend Father in God, SAMVEL, by the providence
of God Archbishop of York his Grace, Metropolitan of England, to be
presently published and affixed in all the Parish Churches within his said
Graces Jurisdiction, for the better reforming of certain abuses within the
same.
THe ancient and laudable use of Visitations, have been to reform such
abuses, as by tract of time have crept into the Church; The discovery of which
abuses, as by a Book of Articles is offered unto you, and you bound by a
sacred oath to present the same; so for the refreshing of your memories, and
discharge of mine own conscience toward God, I thought fit to denote some in
particular unto you.

First, I understand of a great irreuerence, openly showed in your Churches and
Chapels during the time of Divine Service; which is, that young men misled by
the example of their elders, do sit covered with their hats on their heads,
neither regarding the holiness of the house of God, nor the greatness of the
Divine Majesty, which is to be worshipped with fear and reverence: For a
present remedy of this abuse, I require the Churchwardens and Sidemen, at the
beginning of Divine Service, to look carefully upon the Congregation, and if
any of the elder sort offend in this kind, I require them to go personally
unto them, and to desire them in gentle terms to remember themselves, and to
sit uncovered: and if after gentle admonition they do not forbear, then I
require that they be presented at my next Court day, holden in York: and for
the younger sort, I require the Churchwardens to go personally unto them, in
case they offend, and to rebuke them sharply for their contempt, and if they
persist, and will not obey by uncovering their heads, I will the Churchwardens
to pull off their hats, and I require the masters of such profane servants, and
fathers of children, to give them such private chastisement, as the quality of
their fact requires.

Secondly, I am given to understand, that it is grown usual and familiar for
men to walk up and down, and to talk before and after Divine Service within
the Church, and in some Parishes to keep Ales and Drinkings within the Church,
and when the Parishioners do make their usual rates, that they go up to the
Communion Table, and there write them, and that about the setting of those
rates many unchristian and unseemly words are exchanged amongst them, to the
great dishonor of Almighty God, and the profanation of his holy Temple, which
if they be not speedily amended, I shall use all the severity against the
offenders, that any Law, Canon, or Constitution Ecclesiastical shall afford.

Thirdly, it comes from the groans and sighs of the people, that for a book
of Articles containing little more then two leaves in quarto, which may be
printed for the value of a penie, an Archdeacon at his annual Visitation,
exacteth from every Parish, two shillings and six pence, and compels them
every year to take new books, whereas one book will serve for many years,
and that the Archbishops Chancellor in the Visitation rises higher, and
requires for every book of Articles of every Parish, iij. s. Ab initionon
fuit sic; and malus mos, quanto antiquior, tanto nequior. For redress hereof,
I require the Archdeacon at his annual Visitation to take for every book of
Articles but six pence, and in seven years following to impose no book at
all upon the several Parishes, but to let their old books to serve the turn,
except such Parishes as have lost their old books: And for mine own
Visitation, I command, that no more then twelve pence be required for a book
of Articles, nor no more paid; the distribution of which twelve pence amongst
the Apparators and others, I reserve to my self.

Fourthly, I hear much complaint of the increase and exaction of Fees, by
several Officers in several Courts, much to the scandal of our
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: For remedy whereof I strictly charge my Register
to carry with him, and to affixe in a public place, that all men may see and
read them, a Table containing the several, ancient, and accustomed Fees for
all matters belonging to my Visitation: and if any of my Officers shall directly
or indirectly, exact or take any greater Fees, upon just complaint I shall lay
suspension, or any other greater censure upon him, that the Law Ecclesiastical
shall authorize me to inflict.

So God bless us.
Imprinted at London by John Bill, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. 1629.
