A Cathechisme for Children.
Question.

WHich is the only comfort, both in life and in death?

Answer.

That both concerning my soul and my body, 1. Cor. 6 19. 1 Thessalonians. 5.10
whether I live or I die, Romans 14.8
I am not mine own, but belong only unto my most faithful Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ, 1. Cor. 3.23.
who with his precious blood most fully making amends for all my, sins, 1.
Pet. 1.18. 1 John. 1.7. and. 2.2.
has delivered me from the power of the Devil, 1. John. 3.8 Hebr. 2.14.
and keeps me so, John 6.39.
that without the will of my heavenly father, there can not so much as an hair
fall from my head. Matthew. 10.30. Luke. 21.18.
Yea, and further, that all things must serve for my salvation, Romans 8, 22.
wherefore he has made me sure of everlasting life, by his holy spirit, 2.
Cor. 1.22. and 5.5. Ephesians. 2 14. Romans 8.
and makes me prompt and ready from henceforth to live according to his will.
Romans 8.14*


Question.

How many things are needful for thee to know, that thou may come by, and
enjoy this comfort, that thou may both live and die blessedly?

Answer.

Three: Luke 24.47. 1. Cor. b. 11. Tit. 3.3.4.5. etc.
first, how great my sin and wretchedness is. John 9.41 Romans 3.
The second, by what means I may be delivered from my sin. John. 17.3.
The third is, what thanks I owe unto my Lord God for my deliverance. Ephe.
5.10. 1. Pet 2.9.10 11.12. Romans 6.11.12.13. Math. 5.16. 2. Tim. 2.15.


The first part of man's wretchedness or miserable state.
Question.

BY what means shall thou come by the knowledge of thy wretchedness?

Answer.

By the law of God. Romans 3.20.


Question.

What does the law of God require of us?

Answer.

That does Christ in a short sum teach us. Matthew xxij. and Luke x. Thou
shall love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all
thy thought, and with all thy strength. Luke 10.27
This is the first, and greatest commandment. And the second is like unto
this. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thine own self. And the whole law and
Prophets hang upon these two commandments.

Question.

Can thou keep all these things perfectly?

Answer.

No, Romans 3.10. 23 1. John. 1.8
for I am ready and disposed of nature, to hate God and my neighbor. Romans 8.7.
Ephe. 2* 3.


Question.

Did God then make man so untoward, crooked, and so froward?

Answer.

No, Tit. 3 Genesis 1.31.
for he made him good, and unto the likeness of his own self, Ge. 1.36.27
that is, endued with true righteousness and holiness, that he should rightly
know God his maker, and heartily love him, and live for ever with him, to that
end that he might love and praise him. 2. Co. 3.18 Col. 3.10. Ephe. 4.24.


Question.

Then, from whence sprange up this crooked frowardnes of man's nature?

Answer.

Of the fall and disobedience of our first father and mother, Adam and Eve,
Genesis 3.5. Romans 5.12.18 19.
by whom our nature is made so crooked and naughty, that we be all conceived
and borne in sin. Psalm. 51.7. Genesis 5.3.


Question.

Are we then all so wounded, that we be utterly vnsufficie^t to do any good
thing, and disposed and ready to all vice and wickedness?

Answer.

Yes surely John. 3.6 Genesis 6.5
except that we be borne again by the holy Ghost. Ioh. 3.5.


Question.

Does not God then do wrong to man, whiles he requires of him by the law to
do those things which he is not able to do, perform, and fulfill?

Answer.

Noe, Ephe. 4.24.
for God made Adam so, that he might fulfill those things, but he at the
entisement of the devil, Luke 10.30. etc.
and by his own stubbornes, both spoiled himself and his after comers of
those godly gifts.

Question.

Does God let go unpunished such stubburnes, and departing from him?

Answer.

Nay, he is by horrible means angry, Romans 5.12. Heb. 9.27.
both with our sins that are grafted in us by nature, and also with them that
we afterward work and do, and the same he punishes by his most righteous
judgment, with present and everlasting punishments, as he does pronounce.
Cursed is every man that abides not in all things that are written in the
book of the Law, to do them. Deuteronomy. 27.26 Gal. 3.10.


Question.

Then is not God also merciful?

Answer.

He is in deed merciful, Exodus 34.6.
but so that he is also righteous, Exo. 20.5. Psalm. 5.5. 2 Cor. 6.14.
wherefore his righteousness requires, ye that which is don against the most
high majesty of God, should be punished with the greatest punishments both of
soul and body.

The second part of the deliverance of man.
A. iiij.

Question.

THen, when as by the right judgment of God, we are in danger both of
everlasting pains, and of such that lasts here but for a time: is there yet
any way or means whereby we may be delivered from these pains, and be
brought into favor again with God?

Answer.

God will that we shall make amends or satisfaction unto his righteousness, Exodus
25. and 23.7.
wherefore we must needs either by our selves, or by some other, content him
Romans 8.3.4.


Question.

Can we by our selves make amends or satisfaction unto him?

Answer.

By no means at all, but rather from day to day, to increase our debt. Job.
9.2.3. and 15.15. Matthew. 6.12.


Question.

Can any creature in heaven or in earth, which is only a creature, make
satisfaction, recompense, or amends for us and our sins?

Answer.

None at all: For to begin withal, God will not punish that in any other
creature which is due to be paid by man, Heb. 2.14.
and moreover it can not (because it is nothing but a creature) abide the wrath
of god against sin, and deliver other from the same. Psalm. 130.


Question.

What manner of man is to be sought out, to be our mediator and deliverer?

Answer.

He which is in deed, a very right man, and perfectly righteous, and yet more
mighty then al creatures, that is he which also is even very true god 1. Cor.
15.21. Ier. 23.6. Isai. 53.11. 2. Cor. 5.25 Heb. 7.16. Ies. 7.14. Romans 8.3.
Ier. 33.16.


Question.

Why is it needful that he should be a very man, and perfectly righteous?

Answer.

Because the righteousness of God requires, that ye same nature which has
sinned, should pay and make amends for sin. Romans 5.1.15.
But he that is a sinner, can not pay and make amends for other sinners. 1.
Pet. 18.


Question.

Why must he also be very GOD withal?

Answer.

A.v.

That by his godly power he may abide the burden of gods wrath in his flesh,
Isay. 5.8. Act. 2.14. 1 Pet. 3.18.
and may get again and restore unto us, the righteousness and life which we
have lost. 1. Io. 1.2. and 49.10. Act. 20.28. Ioh. 3 16.


Question.

Who is that mediator which is both very God and very man, and perfectly
righteous withal?

Answer.

Our Lord Jesus Christ, Math. 1.23. 1 Timothy 3.16. Luke 2.11.
which is made unto us the wisdom of GOD, righteousness, hallower and
deliverer. 1. Cor. 1.30


Question.

How know thou this?

Answer.

By the Gospel which God did open in Paradise, Genesis 3.15.
and afterward has farther set it abroad by the Patriarchs and Prophets
Genesis 22.18. and 49.10.11. Romans 1.2. Heb. 1.1. Act. 3.22.23 24. and 10.11. Romans
1.2. Heb. 1.1. Heb. 10.7.
and did darkely declare it as it were in a shadow, by the sacrifices and other
ceremonies of the law (e) and last of all fulfilled it by his only begotten
son. Romans 10.4. Gal. 4.4.


Question.

Then is salvation given by Christ to all men that perished in Adam?

Answer.

Not to all: but only to them that by a true faith are graffed into him, and
receive or be partakers of his benefits or good deeds. Ioh. 1.12 and 3.36. Ies.
53.11. Psalm. 2.12 Romans 11.17.19. Heb. 4.2. and 10.39.


Question.

What is faith?

Answer.

It is not only a knowledge, whereby I do surely assent to al things Heb.
11.1.3 Iac. 2.19, Gal. 2.20.
which God has opened to us in his word: but also a sure trust Romans 4.16. etc.
Iac. 1.8. Romans 5.1.
kindled in my heart by the holy Ghost Matt. 16.17 Ioh. 3.5. Ga. 5 2. Phil.
1.1.9.
through the gospel, Romans 1.16. Romans 10.17.
whereby I am at peace with god, surely reckning with my self and judging, that
for giuenesse of sins, everlasting life, and righteousness, was given not
only to others but also to me Heb. 10.38. Heb. 2.4. Mat 9.2. Ephesians. 2.7.8.9.
Romans 5.1
and that freely by the mercy of God, for the deserving of Christ alone. Romans
3.24 25. Gal. 2.16.


Question.

What are those things that a Christian man must needs believe?

Answer.

All things that are promised in the Gospel, Ioh. 20.31. Mat 28.20.
the sum whereof is contained in the creed, or articles of our faith, wherein
is shortly contained, as in a certain short sum, the chief points of the
Catholic and undoubted faith of all Christians.

Question.

What is the Creed ye speak off?

Answer.

I Believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth. And in Jesus
Christ his only begotten son our Lord. Which was conceived by the holy
Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary. Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified
dead and buried, went down into hell. The third day he rose again from the
dead. And went up into heaven, and sits there at the right hand of God the
father Almighty. From thence shall he come to judge the quick and the dead. I
believe in the holy Ghost. That there is a catholic church. A communion of
Saints. Forgiveness of sins. The rising again of the flesh. And the life
everlasting. Amen.

Question.

Into how many parts is this Creed divided?

Answer.

Into three parts: the first is of the everlasting father, and of our
creation. The second is of the son, and our redemption or deliverance. The
third is of the holy Ghost, and making of us holy, and fauing us from sin.

Question.

When as there is but one only substance of God: Deuteronomy. 6.4. Ephe. 4.5.6.
Why namest thou three: ye father, the son, and the holy ghost?

Answer.

Because God has so opened him self in his word, Ies. 16.1. Luke 4.18. psa
110.1. Math. 3.16.17. and 28.19. 1. Ioh. 5.7.
that these three sundry persons are that one, true, and everlasting God.

Of the Father.
Question.

What do thou believe, when thou say, I believe in god ye father
almighty, maker of heaven and earth?

Answer.

I do believe that the everlasting father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
has made of nothing heaven and earth, and all things that are therein: Genesis
1.6. Psalm. 33.6.
and with his everlasting counsel and provision, vpholdeth and governs all
the same Psalm. 104. and 115.3. Matthew 10.29. Heb. 1 3. Romans 11.36
for Christ's sake, is my god and my father: John. 1.12. Romans 8.15. Gal.
4.5.6*7. Ephe. 15.
and therefore so trust and rest in him, ye I do not doubt but he will provide
for me all things needeful both for my soul and Psalm. 55.23. Matthew 6.25. 26.
Luke 12.22.
body, and that he will also turn unto my salvation, all the euilles and
troubles that he lays upon me Rom 8.28.
in this troublesome life, both because he can do it, as an almighty God,
Romans 10.12
and will do it, as a gentle Father. Matthew. 6.26 and 7.9.10.11.


Question.

What is the provision, or providence of God?

Answer.

The almighty power of God Matthew. 17.25. etc.
present in every place, whereby it holds up as it were with a hand Heb.
8.2.3.
and governs heaven and earth and all creatures, in so much that those
things that grow upon the earth, as rain, also fair weather, and dryness,
plenteousnesse in bearing, and barreunesse, meat and drink, Ier. 5.24. Act.
14.17.
health and sickness, Ioh. 9.5.
riches and poverty: Proverb. 22.2.
to conclude, all things fall and come unto us, not without advise or by
chance, but by his fatherly advised counsel, will, and purpose.

Question.

What profit have we by this knowledge of the creation, and providence of God?

Answer.

That in adversity we may be patient, Romans 5, 3. Iac. 1* 3. Job. 1.21.
and in prosperity thankeful, Deuteronomy. 8.10. 1, These. 5.18
and in time to come, we may have a very good hope in God our most faithful
Father, To. 5.4.5.6.
knowing that there is nothing that can draw us away from his love, Rom* ^,
38.39.
for all creatures are so in his power that without his will they can not only
do nothing, but even not so much as to stir or move. Job. 1.12. and 2.6. Pro.
21. 1 Act. 17.25.28.


Of the Son.
Question.

WHy is the Son of God called Jesus, that is, the savior.

Answer.

Because he saves us from all our sins, Matthew. 1.21 Heb. 7.25.
and as no salvation ought to be craved of any other, (...) there none be found
in other, but in h^^^^dne. Act. 4.12.


Question.

Then whether do they believe in the only savior Jesus, which seek happiness
and salvation of saints, or of them selves, or of any other thing?

Answer.

No, for although they boaste themselves, and reidice in him as the savior in
their words, yet for all that, in very deed they deny the only savior
Jesus, 1. Cor. 1.13. and 31. Ga. 5.4
for either must Jesus not be a perfect savior, or else al they ye receive him
with a true faith for a savior, have in their possession in him, al things
necessary unto salvation. Heb. 12.2. Ies. 96. Col 1 19.20. and. 2.10. John.
1.16


Question.

Why is he called Christus; that is, anointed?

Answer.

Because he was ordained of the Father, and was anointed of the holy ghost;
Psalm. 45.8. Heb. 1.9.
the highest prophet and doctor, Deutr. 18.15 Act. 3.22.
which opened unto us the secret counsel, Ioh. 1.18. and 15.15.
and all the will of his father concerning our redemption and deliverance. And
the high Priest, who with one sacrifice or offering of his body and no more:
has bought us again, and continually makes intercession to his Father for
us. Romans 8.34. and 5.9.10.
And a King which governs us with his word and his spirit, and defends
and keeps the salvation which we have gotten by him. Psalm. 2.6. Luke 1.33.
Matthew. 28.18. Ioh. 10.28.


Question.

But why art thou called a christian?

Answer.

Because through faith I am a member of Jesus Christ, Act. 11.26. 1. Cor. 6.15.
and am partaker of his anointing, Ioh. 2.27. Ies. 59* 21. Act. 2.17. Joel.
2.28.
so that I confess his name, Mar 8.38.
and give my self up unto him, to be a living offering of thankfulness, Romans
12.1. Apoc. 5.8.10. 1 Pet. 2.9 2. Tim 2.12 Rom 6.12 13. Apoc 1.6
in this life to fight against sin and Satan with a free and good
conscience, ye afterward I may hold and enjoy the everlasting kingdom with
Christ over all creatures. 1 Ti. 1.1^ 19.


Question.

For what cause is Christ called the only begotten son of God, when we are
also the sons of God?

Answer.

Because Christ is only the everlasting and natural son of the Father
everlasting, Ioh. 1.14.18. Heb. 1.2
and we are but sons choosen and taken up of the Father only of favor for
Christ's sake. Romans 8.15. Ephe. 1.6


Question.

Why call thou him our Lord?

Answer.

Because he buying again our bodies and souls from sin, not with gould nor
silver, but with his precious blood, and delivering them from all power of the
devil: has claymed us for his own proper servant, belonging to none other
Lord or Master. 1. Pet. 1.18 19. and 2.9. 1. Cor. 6.20. and 7.23.


Question.

What beleeuest thou, when thou say: he was conceived by the holy Ghost, and
borne of the virgin Mary?

Answer.

That the son of God, which is, Ioh. 1.1. and 17.5. Romans 1.4.
and abides true and everlasting God, Romans 9.5.
has taken the very true nature of man, of the flesh and blood of the virgin
Mary, Ioh. 1.14. Gal. 4.4.
by the working of the holy ghost, Math. 1.18 20. Luke 1.35
that he might be also with all ye true seed of David Psalm. 132.12 Romans 1.3.
like unto his brethren in all things, Phil. 2.7
saving only in sin. Heb. 4.15.7.26.


Question.

What profit take thou of the holy conception and birth of Christ?

Answer.

That he is our mean or mediator, He. 2 16.17
and with his innocentnes and perfect holiness covers my sins in the which
I am conceived, to come into the sight of God. Psalm. 32.1 1. Cor. 1.30


Question.

What beleeuest thou, when thou say he suffered?

Answer.

That he, all the time of his life while he was here upon earth, but
specially at his last time, did suffer the wrath of GOD against the sin of
all mankind, 1. Pet 2 24 and. 3.18. Ies. 53.12
that with his passion as one sacrifice once for all, 1. Ioh. 2.2. and 4.10.
Romans 3.25
he should purchase mercy, and should deliver both our bodies and our souls
from everlasting dampnation, and get us the grace of god, and righteousness,
and everlasting life.

Question.

For what cause did he suffer under judge Pilate?

Answer.

That he being innocent, and yet condemned Luke 25.14. Ioh. 19.8.
before a civil judge, might deliver us from the straight judgment of God
which we had deserved, and should have suffered if Christ had not suffered this
sharp judgment for us. psalm. 65.2.5 Ies. 53.2. Cor 5.21. Gal. 3.13.


Question.

Is there any other cause beside, why that he should rather suffer on the
cross, then die any other death?

Answer.

Yes, there is one in deed: for by this thing I am assured that he took upon
himsefe the curse which was due unto me. For the death of the cross was cursed
of God. Deuteronomy. 21.23 Gal. 3.13.


Question.

Why must Christ humble himself even unto the death?

Answer.

Because that the justice and truth of God Genesis 2.17.
could not be contented and swaged for our sins by any other means but by
the death of the son of god. Heb. 2.9.14 15. Phil. 2.8.


Question.

Why was he also buried?

Answer.

That thereby we should have sure witness that he was truly dead, and not
feynedly. Act. 13.29. Mat. 27.60. Luke 23.35. Ioh. 19.38.


Question.

But when as Christ died for us, why must we also die?

Answer.

Our death is not a making of amends for our sins: but a dying from Sin,
and a going into everlasting life. Ioh. 5.24. Phil. 1.23. Romans 7.24.


Question.

What profit do we further receive by the sacrifice and death of Christ?

Answer.

That by the virtue of his death our old man is crucified Romans 6.6.7 8.11.12.
killed and buried with him, that the evil desires and lusts of the flesh
should not afterward reign in us, Romans 6.12.
but that we should offer our selves unto him an offering of thanksgiving.
Romans 12.1.


Question.

Why is it further said: he went down into hell?

Answer.

That in my grievous temptations and assaltes, I might stay and make sure my
self by this comfort, that my Lord Jesus Christ by unspeakable verations and
griefs, painful troubles and fears of mind, into the which both before and
most of all when he hanged on the cross, he was cast into has delivered me
from the sorrowful grief and pains of Hell Ies. 53.10. Mat. 27.46.


Question.

What profit have we by the rising again of Christ?

Answer.

First that by his rising again he overcame death, that he might make us
partakers of his righteousness, which he had purchased unto us by his death.
1. Cor. 15.17 45.55. Romans 4.25. 1. Pet. 1.3 21.
Moreover, we are also stirred up by his power, unto a new life. Romans 6 4.
Col. 3.1.5 Ephesians. 2.21
And the third profit is, that the resurrection of our head Christ, is a
pledge and a perfect assurance unto us that we shall rise again in glory. 1.
Co. 15.12 Romans 8.11


Question.

How understand thou this, that he is gone up into heaven?

Answer.

That Christ (the Apostles looking on) was taken up from the earth into
heaven, Act. 1.9 Mat. 28. Mar. 16. Luke 24.
and yet still is there for our sakes, Heb. 4.24. and 7.25.9.11 Romans 8.34. Ephe.
4.10 Col 3.1.
and will be until he shall come again to judge the quick and the dead. Act.
1


Question.

Shall Christ not then be with us until the end of the world as he has
promised? Mat. 28.20. Mat. 24.30.


Answer.

Christ is true God and true man, and so according unto his man's nature, he is
not now upon the earth, Mat. 26 11. Ioh. 16.28. and 17.11. Act. 3.21.
but after his Godly nature, majesty, grace, and spirit, he is never away
from us. Ioh. 14.17. etc. and 16.28. and 16.13. Ephe. 4.8 Augustinus Tract. in
Ioann. 50.


Question.

But whether by this means are the two natures of Christ pulled in sunder or
no, if Christ's manhood be not wheresoever his godheade is?

Answer.

Nay, for when as the Godheade of Christ cannot be enclosed nor holden within
any certain compass, and is present in every place, Act. 7.49. and 17.28.
Ier. 23.24.
it must needs be a good argument that his Godhead is without the nature of his
manhood which he has taken upon him, and reaches farther, and yet for all
that it is fast in the same, and abides personally joined thereunto. Col. 2.9.
Ioh. 3.13. and 11 15. Math. 28.6.


Question.

What fruit have we by the going up of Christ into heaven?

Answer.

First that he makes intercession for us in heaven, unto the father. 1. Ioh.
2.1.2 Romans 8.34.
Then that we have our flesh in heaven, that thereby we may be surely assured,
as by a sure pledge, that hereafter he will take us that are his members, unto
him which is our head. Ioh. 14.2. and 20.17. Ephesians. 2.6.
Thirdly, that he sends to us his spirit in the stead of a pledge Ioh. 14.16.
and 20.7. Act. 2.2. Cor. 1.22.2. Cor. 5.5.
between him and us, by whose strong working, we seek not earthly things, but
the things yt are above, where he is sitting at the right hand of god. Col. 3.1.
Phi. 3.


Question.

Why is it further said, that he is sitting at the right hand of God?

Answer.

Because Christ therefore is gone up into heaven, to show that he is the head
Ephesians. 1.20.21.22.23. and 5 23. Coll. 1.18.
of the Church by who^ the father governs all things. Matthew. 28.18. Ioh.
5.22.


Question.

What profit is this glory of our head Christ unto us?

Answer.

First that through his holy spirit, he powers into us, (his members) heavenly
gifts, Ephe. 4 10.
the next is, that he shieldeth and defends us by his might against all our
enemies. Psalm. 2.9. and 110.12. Ioh. 10 28. Ephe. 4.8


Question.

What comfort have thou by the coming again of Christ, to judge ye quick and
the dead?

Answer.

That in all my persecutions and troubles I do look up to heaven, holding my
head cherefully up for ye self same judge Luke 21.28. Romans 8.23.33 Phil. 3.20.
Titus. 2.13.
which purposedly before did deliver himself to the judgment of God for me, and
has taken away al curse from me, which shall cast all his and my enemies into
everlasting pain, 2 Thessalonians. 6.7 1. These. 4.16 Matthew. 25.41 Matthew. 25.34
and shall bring me with all other chosen persons, into the heavenly joys
and everlasting glory. Mat. 25.34.


Of the holy ghost.
Question.

What do thou believe, of the holy Ghost?

Answer.

First, that he is a true and everlasting God, with the everlasting father and
the son Genesis 1.2. Ies 48.16.1. Cor. 3.16.1. Cor. 6.19. Act. 5 3.4
Secondly that he is given unto me, Matthew. 28 19.2. Cor. 1 21.22.
that by true faith he makes me partaker of Christ, and all his good deeds.
Gal. 3.14. 1. Pet. 1.2. 1. Cor. 6.17
And thirdly, comfort me, and abides with me for ever. Act 9.31. Ioh. 14
16. 1. Pet. 4.14.


Question.

What is thy belief concerning the holy and Catholic Church of Christ?

Answer.

I believe that the son of God does Ioh. 10.11.

and that I am one lively members of that company, 1. Ioh. 3.21. 3. Cor. 13.5
and shall so abide for ever. 1. Ioh. 1.19.1 1. Cor. 1 8.9. Romans 8.35.


Question.

What meanest thou by the communion, and fellowship of saints?

Answer.

First, that all and every one that believes, are in common partakers of
Christ and of his good deeds, as his members and parts of his body, 1. Ioh.
1.3 Romans 8.32. 1 Cor. 12 13 21 1. Cor. 6.17.
and then that every man ought willingly, readely, and carefully, to bestow
the gifts which he has received, to the common profit and health of all
men. Cor. 13.5 Phil. 2.4.5.6.


Question.

What beleeuest thou of the forgiveness of sins?

Answer.

That GOD for the satisfaction or full recompense that Christ has made 1. Ioh.
2.2 Cor. 5.19.21.
has put out the remembrance of my sins, and also of that my crooked nature
and wickedness wherewith I must fight all my life time, Ier. 31.34 Ps
103.3.10.12 Romans 7.24.25 Rom 8 1.2.3.
and that he will freely give unto me the righteousness of Christ, so ye I
shall not come at any time to judgment, to be condemned. Ioh. 3.18.


Question.

What comfort have thou by the rising again of the flesh.

Answer.

That not only my soul (after that it shall depart from the body) shall
straight way be taken up unto Christ her head, Luke 23.43 Phil. 1.23.
but also that this my flesh (raised up by this power of Christ) shall be
joined again unto my soul, and shall be made like unto the glorious body of
Christ. 1. Cor. 15.53.54. Job. 19 25.26. 1. Ioh. 3.2. Phil. 3 21


Question.

What comfort take thou of the article of everlasting life?

Answer.

That for as much as I feel already, the beginning of everlasting life in my
2. Co. 5.2.3
heart, it shall afterward come to pass, that after this life, I shall come
to full and perfect blessedness, wherein I may praise God for ever, which
blessedness neither eye has seen, nor ear has hard, neither the thought of
man is able to reach unto. 1. Cor. 2.9.


Question.

But when thou beleuest all these things, what profit have thou thereby?

Answer.

That I am righteous in Christ before God, and an heir of everlasting life.
Heb. 2.4. Romans 1.17. Ioh. 3.36.


Question.

How art thou rightuous before God?

Answer.

Only by faith or belief in Jesus Christ, Romans 2.3.21.22.24. Gal 2.16. Ephesians.
2.8 9. Phil. 3.8.9.
in so much that although my concience did accuse me, that I have sinned
grievously against all the commandments of God, and have kept perfectly
never a one of them, Romans 3.9. etc.
and am also ready and disposed yet still to all evil, Romans 7.23.
yet for all that (so that I can receive all these good deeds of Christ by a
true faith of my mind) the perfect satisfaction or amends making, the
righteousness and holiness of Christ, is counted and given unto me by the
only mercy of God, Romans 3.22. Ioh. 3.18. Tit. 3.5. Deuteronomy. 9.10. Ezech. 36.22.
Romans 3.24 Ephe. 2.8.1. Ioh. 2.2.1. Ioh. 2.1. Rom 4.4.2. Cor. 5.19.
even as though I had never do any sin, neither any spot should cleave unto
me: and furthermore, as though I had fulfilled in mine own person, the
obedience which Christ has fulfilled and performed for me 2 Cor. 5.21


Question.

Why do thou hold that thou art made righteous by faith alone?

Answer.

Not because I do please God with the worthiness of my faith, but because the
amends making or satisfaction, righteousness and holiness of Christ, are my
righteousness before god, 1. Cor. 1.30. etc.
and I cannot take hold thereof, and apply the same unto me by any other
means, then by faith alone. 1. Ioh. 5.10.


Question.

Why are not our good works accounted righteousness: or at the least some
part of righteousness before God?

Answer.

because that righteousness that must stand fast before the judgment of God,
must be in all points perfect and agreeing with the word of God, Gal. 3.10.
Deuteronomy. ^7.26
and all our good works (even the most holy and perfectest works that we do
in this life) are imperfect and defiled with sin. Ies. 64.6.


Question.

How do our good works deserve nothing, when as God does promise that he
will give a reward for them, both in this life, and in the life to come?

Answer.

That reward is given not of deserving, but of favor. Luke 17.10


Question.

Does not this learning make men to be careless, Godless, and of a loose life?

Answer.

No, for it is not possible but that they that are grafted into Christ through
faith, shall bring forth good and thankful fruits. Matthew. 7.18. Ioh. 15.5.


Of the Sacramantes.
Question.

THen, seeing that only faith makes us partakers of Christ and of his good
deeds, from whence comes this faith.

Answer.

From the holy Ghost, Ephe. 2.8. and 6.23. Ioh. 3.5. Phil. 1.29.
who kindles it in our hearts through the preaching of the Gospel, and
strengthens the same by the using of the Sacraments. Matthew. 28. 1^ 20. 1
Pet. 1.22.23.


Question.

What are the Sacraments?

Answer.

They are holy signs and seals set before our eyes, ordained of God for that
cause, that by them he might open unto us, and settle or confirm more largely
the promise of the Gospel: that is to wit, he gives freely forgiveness of
sins, and life everlasting, not only to the number of believers, but to
every one that believes, for ye only sacrifice of Christ, which he made
perfect upon the cross, Genesis 17.11 Romans 4.11. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Leui. 6.25. Heb
9.8.9.24. Ezech. 20.12. 1. Sam. 17 36. Ies 6.6.7. and 54.9.


Question.

Then whether do both the word and Sacraments tend to that end, that they may
lead our faith unto the sacrifice of Christ fully ended on the cross, as unto
the ground of salvation?

Answer.

It is so in deed, for the holy Ghost teaches by the Gospel, and assures
us by the Sacraments, that all our salvation stands in the only sacrifice
of Christ, offered for us upon the cross. Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.27.


Question.

How many Sacraments has Christ ordained in the new testament?

Answer.

Two, Baptism, and the holy supper.

Of Baptism.
Question.

How art thou warned and assured in Baptism that thou art partaker of that
only sacrifice?

Answer.

Because Christ commanded the outward washing, Matthew. 28.19 Act. 2.38.
putting to this promise: Marc. 16.16 Matthew. 3.11. Romans 6.3.
that I am assuredly washed (by his blood and the holy Ghost) from all the
uncleanness of my soul, yt is, from all my sins, as I am outwardly washed
with water, Mark. 1.4 Luk.3 3.
whereby all the filthiness of the body is scowred away.

Question.

What is it to be washed with the blood and spirit of Christ?

Answer.

It is to receive of God forgiveness of our sins freely for Christ's blood
sake, which he shed for us in his sacrifice upon the cross, Heb. 12 24 1. Pe.
1.2. Apo 1.5. and 22.14 zach. 13.1. Ezech. 36.25.
and also to be made new men by the holy Ghost, and by his making of us holy
to be made members of Christ, that thereby we may die from sin more and more,
and may live holily and vnblamedly. Job. 8.33. and 3.5. 1. Cor. 6.11.12.13. To
6.4. Col. 2.12


Question.

Where promised Christ that he would so surely wash us with his blood and
spirit, as we are washed outwardlye with the outward water of Baptism?

Answer.

In the xvi. of saint Mark, where as he first ordained Baptism, whose words
are these. Go and teach all nations, and Baptize them in the name of the
father, and of the son, and of the holy Ghost. Math. 28.19
And he that will believe and be baptized, shall be saved, but he yt will not
believe shall be dampened. Mat. 16.16
and this promise is rehearsed again whereas the scripture names Baptism the
bath of the new birth, Tit. 3.5.
and washing away of sins. Act. 21.16.


Question.

Is not the outward baptising with water, the washing away of our sins?

Answer.

It is not: Matthew. 3.12 1. Pet. 3.21. Ephe. 5.26.
for only the blood of Christ makes us clean from all sin. Job. 17. 1. Cor.
9.11.


Question.

Then why does the holy Ghost call baptism the bath of the new birth, and
washing away of sin?

Answer.

God not without a great cause speaks so: to wit, not only to teach us ye as
the filthiness of our bodies is scoured away with water, so likewise are our
sins washed and scowred away with the blood and spirit of Christ: Apoc. 1.5.
and 7.8. 1. Cor. 6.11.
but also much more, yt he might sicker and assure us by his goodly token and
pledge, that we are as surely washed from our sins inwardly by the inward
washing, as we are outwardly washed with the outward and seable water. Mark.
16.^6. Gal. 3.17.


Question.

Ought all young speachlesse children in be baptized?

Answer.

Yea in any case, for when as they belong as well unto the covenant or
promise, and to the Church of GOD, as they do that are fully grown and are
perfect men and women, Genesis 17.7.
and when as forgiveness of sins Mat. 16.14
and the holy Ghost the Luke 1.14.15. Psalm. 22.11. Esa. 44.1.2 Act. 2 36.
worker of faith, is as well promised to them through the blood of Christ, as
to them that are full grown men and women: they are to be grafted into the
Church by baptism, and are to be known from the children of unbelievers or
infidels, Act. 10.47.
as in the owe Testament, the children of them, that believed were known from
them that believed not, by circumcision. Genesis 17.14
In whose place and steed (it now being taken away) Baptism was appointed.
Col. 2.12.13


Of the Supper of the Lord.
Question.

How art thou in the Supper of the Lord warned, assured, and sickered, that
thou art partaker of that only one sacrifice of Christ offered upon the
cross, and of all his good deeds?

Answer.

Because Christ has commanded me and all faithful men, to eat of this
bread that is broken, and to drink of this cup that is reached unto me in the
remembrance of him, with promise put thereto, Matthew. 26.27.28. Mark. 14
22.23.24 Luke 22.19.20 1 Cor. 1.16 17. and 11.23.24 25. and 12.13.
that first his body was assuredly broken on the Cross and offered for me, and
his blood as surely shed for me, as I see the bread of the Lord broken unto
me, and the cup of the Lord reached unto me.

More over that my soul is as well fed unto everlasting life with his body
which was crucified for us, and with his blood which was shed for us, as I
receive with the mouth of my body the bread and the wine (which are tokens of
the body and blood of our Lord) at the hands of my sheepherd or elder of the
Church.

Question.

What is it to eat the body that was crucified, and to drink the blood that
was shed?

Answer.

It is not only to embrace and receive the whole Passion and death of Christ
with a sure trust of mind, and to get by it forgiveness of sins and life
everlasting: Ioh. 6.35.40.47.48.50 51.53.54.
but also to be so joined unto his holy body more and more through the holy
ghost which dwells in Christ and in us, Ioh. 6.55.56
that although he be in heaven Act. 3.21 Act. 1.9.1. Cor 11.26.
and we in earth, yet for all that we are flesh of his flesh, and bones of
his bones, 1* Cor. 6.15 17.19.1. Ioh. 3.24. and 4.13. Ephesians. 3.17.
and as all the members or limbs of a man's body are quickened or have life of
one soul, so are we quickened and governed and have life with one spirit. Ioh.
14.23. Ioh. 6.56.57 58. Ioh. 15.1.2.3.4.5.6. Ephesians. 4 15.16


Question.

In what place*promised Christ that he would as surely give his body and
blood to be eaten and dronken to them that believe, as they do eat the
bread that is broken and drink the wine out of the cup?

Answer.

In the place where he did first ordain his supper in these words. 1. Cor.
11.23. etc. Marh 26.26. etc. Mark. 14.22. etc. Luke 21 19. etc.
Our Lord Jesus Christ in that night he was betrayed took the bread, and
after he had given thanks he brake it and said: take eat, this is my body
which is broken for you, do this in the remembrance of me. And so likewise
after supper he took the cup, saying: this cup is the new testament in my
blood, Exodus 24.8 Heb. 9.20.
do this as often as ye shall drink, in my remembrance, Ex. 13.9.
For as often as ye shall eat this bread and drink of this cup, ye shall show
the death of the Lord till be come. i. Cor. xi. This promise is rehearsed
again by S. Paul. i. Cor. x. where. he says: The cup of tha^kesgiuing wherwe
we give thanks is it not the pertaking of Christ's blood? is not the bread that
we break, the partaking of the body of Christ? Because we being many are one
bread and one body, 1. Cor. 10.16.17.
for we are al partakers of one bread.

Question.

Are then bread and wine made the very body and blood of Christ?

Answer.

No but as the water of baptism is turned into the blood of Christ, neither
is the washing away of sin, but only a token and pledge of those things that
are sealed unto us in baptism, even so is not the bread of the Lords supper
the very body of Christ. Math. 16.29. Mark. 14.24.1. Cor. 11 26.27. etc. 1.
Cor. 10.16 17.
Notwithstanding, after the manner of speaking of Sacraments, and the
accustomed fashion of speaking of the holy ghost of these things: Genesis 17.10
14.19. Exodus 12.27.43 48 and 13.9. Act. 7.8. Ex. 24.8. and 29.36. Leuit. 16 10.
and. 7.11 11 Es. 6.6.7. Titus. 3.5. Act. 22.6. 1. Pet. 3 2. 1. Cor. 10.1.2 3.4.
bread is called the body of Christ.

Question.

Why then does Christ call bread his body, and the cup his blood, or the new
Testament through his blood. And Paul calls the bread and wine, the
communion or partaking of his body and blood?

Answer.

Christ speaks so, not without great consideration: to wit, that he may not
only teach us, that even as bread and wine hold up and keep in the life of the
body, so his crucified body and his blood that were shed, are the very true
meat and drink of our soul, whereby it is nourished into everlasting life:
Ioh. 6.51.55
but al so much more he speaks so, to assure and sicker us with this visible
token and pledge, that we are as truly partakers of his body and blood by the
working of the holy Ghost, as we have received these holy tokens in the
remembrance of him, with the mouth of our body: 1. Cor. 10.16.17.
and also that his passion or suffering, and his obedience or keeping of the
whole law, are as surely ours, as though we had suffered our own selfs for
our sins, and had made amends to GOD for them.

Question.

What difference is there between the supper of the Lord, and the popish
Mass?

Answer.

The supper of the Lord witnesses, that all our sins are forgiven us
through that only one sacrifice that he once made on the cross, Heb. 7.27.
and 9.12.26.28 and 10.10 12.14. Ioh. 19. Mat. 26.28.19.20
and that we are all through the holy ghost grafted into Christ 1. Cor. 6.17
and 10.16. and 12.13.
who after his man's nature is only in heaven at ye right hand of the father,
Heb. 1.3. and 8.1.
and will be worshipped there of us. Ioh. 4.21 22. etc. and 20.17. Luke 24.52.
Act. 7.55, 56. Col. 3.1. Phi. 3.20. 1. The. 1.10.
But in the Mass it is denied that the quick and the dead have forgiveness
of sins through the passion of Christ alone, except Christ be offered
every day for them, by the sacrificing Mass priests. Moreover it is taught
in the Mass, that Christ is bodily present under the likeness of bread and
wine, and is therefore to be worshipped in them. In Can. Missae, item de
consecratione distinct. 2
And so the foundation of the Mass, is nothing else but a denial of that
only sacrifice and passion of Jesus Christ and cursed Idolatry, maumetrie,
and worshipping of by gods beside the living God.

Question.

Who ought to come to the supper of the Lord?

Answer.

Only they that repent, and are very sorry that they have angried God with
their sins, and yet trust that they are forgiven them for Christ's sake, and
that the rest of their weakness and imperfectness is covered with his death and
passion, who also desire to go forward and grow more and more in holy life
and conversation. But hypocrites false feigners of holiness, and they that
repent not and will not amend their lives, eat and drink their own
damnation. 1 Cor. 10.21 and 11.28. etc.


Question.

Ought we also to allow them to this supper which show themselves to be
faithles and ungodly, both in their own confession and naughty life?

Answer.

No, for so is the covenant of God unhallowed, and the wrath of God is
stirred against the whole Church. 1. Cor. 11.20.34. Esa. 1.11. and. 66.3.
Iere. 7.21. etc. Psalm. 50.16.
Wherefore the Church of God (according to the appointment of Christ and his
Apostles) using the keys of the kingdom of heaven, ought to hold back such
from the Lords supper, until they repent and amend their manners.

Question.

What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?

Answer.

The preaching of the Gospel, and correction or discipline of the Church,
whereby the kingdom of heaven is opened to them that believe, and is shut up
against them that believe not.

Question.

How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut by the preaching of the Gospel?

Answer.

Where at the commandment of Christ we openly declare and show, that all and
every man's sins are forgiven them by God, for the only deserving of
Christ, as often as they receive with a true faith and believe the promise of
the Gospel. Of the contrary part, it shows unto all them that believe not,
and to all hipocrites, feigners of holiness that are wicked within, that the
wrath Ioh. 20.21.22.13. Math. 16.19.
of God, and everlasting damnation hangs over their heads, according to which
witness of the Gospel, God will judge as well in this life as in the life to
come.

Question.

How is the kingdom of heaven shut to, or opened by the correction or
discipline of the Church?

Answer.

When as according unto the commandment of Christ, they ye are Christen men in
name, but show themselves both in learning and life far from Christ, Romans
12.8 1. Cor 12.21. 1. Tim. 5.17. 1. Cor. 5.4. 2 Cor. 2.6.
after that they have been certain times brotherly warned to forsake their
errors, and leave their evil deeds, and are presented or showed to the
Church, or to them that are appointed of the Church unto that office, and will
not obey their warning: they are shut out by the same, from the use of the
sacraments, and from coming to the fellowship of Christ's Church, from God
himself, and the kingdom of Christ. But again, if they promise to amend
their lives, and do so indeed, they are received into the Church again as
members of Christ, and of the Church. Matthew. 18.15 16.17.18. 1. Cor. 5. 2. Th.
3.14.15 2. Ioh. 10.11. 2. Cor. 2.6.7.10.11.


The third part is of thankfulness.
Question.

WHen as we are delivered from all our sins and wrechednes without any
deserving of us, by the only mercy of God for Christ's ^^^e: why should we
then do good works?

Answer.

Because that after Christ has bought us again with his blood, and makes us
new men by his holy spirit, like unto the image of himself, that we having
received so many good turns, should show our selves all our life time
thankful to God, Romans 6.13. and. 12.12. 1. Pet. 2.5.9 10. 1. Cor. 6.10.
and that he may be honored. Math. 5.19 1. Pet. 2.12.
After that we every man, may be assured of his faith by his fruits. 1 Pet.
1.10. Math. 7.17. Gal. 5.6.22.
Last of all yt we may win other, unto Christ by our honest and sober life, or
good example of living. 1. Pet. 3.1.2 Romans 14.19.


Question.

Can they then not be saved which dee vnthanksfull, and abide still careless
in sin, and are not turned to God from their wickedness?

Answer.

In no case, for the scripture bears witness that no unchaste persons, neither
worshipper of strange Gods, neither horemaister or aduoulterers, neither
covetous men, neither Thieves, nor drunkardes, neither scolding raylers,
neither robbers, shall enter into ye kingdom of god. e. Cor. 6.9 10 Ephesians. 5.5.6
1. Ioh. 3.14.


Question.

In what part stands the turninge of a man to God?

Answer.

In the killing or putting down of the old man To. 6.4.5.6. Ephe. 4.22.23.24.
Col. 35.6.8.9.10. 1. Cor. 5.7. 2. Cor. 7.11
and the quickening and raising up of the new man.

Question.

What is the killing of the old man?

Answer.

It is truly and with all thy heart to be sorry that thou have angered GOD
with thy sins, and every day more and more to hate them and to fly from
the^. Romans 8.13. Joel. 2.13. Ose. 6.1.


Question.

What is the quickening or raising up of the ^ewe man?

Answer.

True gladness or God through Christ, Romans 5.1 and 14.17. Ies. 57.15
and an earnest and ready desire of a man to order his life according to the
will of God, in doing of all manner of Good works. Romans 10.11 Gal. 2.20


Question.

What are good works?

Answer.

Only they ye are done in faith, Romans 14.23
according to the law of GOD 1 Samuel 15.22. Ephe. 2.10. and 6.17.
and are wrought for that end that God may be honored thereby, 1. Co. 10.13
and not they that are devised by us, and in our opinion (without the word of
God) seen to be good. Deuteronomy. 12.32 Ez. 20.18 19 Ies. 29.13. Math. 15.9.


Question

Which is the law of God?

Answer.

God has spoken all these words. Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 5.


The ten Commandementes.
I. I am the Lord thy God which has brought thee out of Egypt, out of the
house of bondage. Thou shall have no other Gods in my sight.

II. Thou shall make to thee no graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that
is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water under the earth.
Thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them: for I the Lord thy God
am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, unto
the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy unto
thousands in them that love me and keep my commandments. The III. Thou
shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not
hold him giltles that takes his name in vain.

The IIII. Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Six days shalt thou
labor and do all that thou haste to do, but the seventh day is the Saboth of
the Lord thy God, in it thou shall do no manner of work, thou and thy son
and thy daughter, thy man servant and thy maid servant, thy cattle, and the
stranger that is within thy gate. For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea and al yt is in them, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
Lord blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.

The V. Honor thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long in the
land which the Lord thy God gives thee.

The VI. Thou shalt do no murder.

The VII. Thou shall not do aduoutrie.

The VIII. Thou shall not steal.

The IX. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

The X. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, nor his wife, not his
servant, nor his maid, nor his ox nor his Ass, nor ane thing that is his.

Question.

How are these commandments divided?

Answer.

Into two tables; Exo. 34.28. Deuteronomy 4.13. and 10.3.4.
of the which the former teaches in it, four commandments, how that we
shall behave our selves toward God. The second table teaches in it six
commandments, what duty, good deeds, and gentleness, we owe unto our
neighbor. Math. 22.38


Question.

What requires God of us, in the first table?

Answer.

That even so dearly as I love the salvation of my soul, so earnestly should
I shun and fly Idolatry, 1. Cor. 6.9.10. and 10.7.14
Maumetrie or worshipping of false gods, witchchraft, Leuit. 18.13 Deuteronomy. 18.11.
Sorcerie, Enchauntmentes, superstition or worshipping of God, by other means
then he has taught in his word, calling for help of Saints or any other
creatures Mat. 4.10. Apo. 19.10. and 22.8.9.
But that I should rightly confess and acknowledge the only and true God, Ioh.
17.3.
and only trust in him, Ier. 17.5.
and should with great lowliness 1. Pet. 5.5.6
submit my self unto him, Heb. 10.36. Col. 1.11. Romans 5.3.4. 1. Cor. 10.10.
Phi. 2.14.
and look for all good things of him alone, Psa. 104.27.28.29.30. Esa. 45.7.
and that with all my heart and withal ye desires of ye same I should love him
Deuteronomy. 6.5. Math. 22.37.
and with reverence worship and honor him so much, Deuteronomy. 6.2. Psalm. 111.10.
Pro. 1.7. Math. 10.18. Math. 4.10. Deuteronomy. 10.20.
that I had leauer forsake all creatures, then to do any thing contrary to
his will. Math. 5.29 30. and 10.37. Act. 5.29.


Question.

What is idolatry?

Answer.

It is in the stead of one God, or beside him that is the true God, who has
opened and showed himself plainly and clearly in his word, to feign, make
or have any thing, wherein thou beleeuest or put thy hope in. Ephesians. 5.5 1.
Par. 16.26. Phil. 3.19. Gal. 4.8 Ephe. 2.12. 1. Ioh. 2.23. 2. Ioh. 9.

Deuteronomy. 4.15. etc. Ies. 40.18 Romans 1.23. Act. 17.29
neither should we worship him any other wise then he has commanded in his
word himself to be worshipped. Sam. 15 23 Deuteronomy. 12.30 Math. 15.9.


Question.

Whether then ought any images or, likeness of things to be made?

should worship or honor God, or give to them any worship, or outward
reverence. Exo. 33.24. and 34.13. Number. 33.52. Deuteronomy. 2.5. and 12.3. and 16.22 ^.
reg. 18.4.

and not with dumme images. Ier. 10.8 Hab. 2.18.1^


Question.

What does God ordain in the third commandemente

Answer.

That we should not only, not use his name spitfully and irreverently in
banning, cursing, forswearing, Leui. 24.11 etc. Le 19.12
and rashly without a just cause in any manner of swearing at all, Mat. 5.37
Iac. 5.12.
neither should we he partakers of those horrible and wicked sins, either by
holding of our peace, or in wincking at them, but that we should use that holy
name of God no otherwise, but with devotion, reverence, and worship Esaias. 45.23
yt he may be worshipped and honored in all our words and deeds Romans 2.24 1.
Tim. 6.1 Col. 5.16.
with a true and steadfast comessione Mat. 10.32
and invocation or 1. Tim. 2 8.

Question.

Is it then so grievous a sin, to dishonor the name of God in swearing and in
cursing, that God is also angry with them that will not as much as lies in
them) hinder, forbid, and let it?

Answer.

Surely it is the most grievous sin, Leu. 5.1.
neither is there any that angreth and displeases him more, then the
spightfull misusing of his name. Wherefore it was his will ye it should be
punished with death. Leu. 24.15.16.


Question.

May not a man sometime godly and lawfully, swear by the name of God?

Answer.

He may. Either when the Magistrate Gods officer requires or commands a man
to swear, or otherwise when need requires, that by this mean a man may get
credit, and the truth may be proved and stablished therewith, that thereby God
may be glorified and praised, and men may be helped thereby. For such a lawful
oath is approved as holy by the word of God, Deu. 6.13. and 10.20. Esaias, 48.1.
Heb. 6.16.
and therefore it was well used of the fathers both in the old and newt
Testament. Genesis 21.24. and. 31.53. Ies. 9.15.19. 1. Sam. 24.23 2. Sam. 3.25. 1.
Reg. 1.29. Romans 1.9.


Question.

Is it lawful for a man to swear by saints or other creatures?

Answer.

Noe, for a lawful oath is the calling upon, or invocation of God, that he
(as only the knower of the secrets of the heart) may give witness unto the
truth and punish the swearer (if wittingly he swear falsely) 2. Cor. 1.13.
but this honor is to be given unto no creature. Math. 5.34.35.36. Iac. 5.12.

and wine my prayers with ye common prayers, 1. Tim. 2.1.2 3.8.9. 1 Cor. 14.15.
and give something according to my riches to ye poor 1. Cor. 16.2
and afterward for all my life time, keep holliday and forbear from all ill

murder. 1. Ioh. 3.15.

requires ye we should love our neighbors as our selves, Matthew. 22 39 and. 7
12.
should use toward them gentleness, Romans 12.10
mildnes, Ephesians. 4.2. Gal. 6.1.2. Matthew. 5.5. Romans 12.18.
meekness, patience and mercy, Math. 5.7. Luke 6.36.
and to turn away or stop (as much as lies in us) such things as may be
hurtefull unto them. Exo. 23.5.
And finally that was should be so minded toward them, that we should be good

and therefore we ought also to hate it, and utterly to defy it, Judah. 23.
and that we should live contrary unto all uncleanness temperatly, soberly and
chastely 1 Thessalonians. 4.34.5.
both in holy wedlock and also in single life. Heb. 13.7. 1. Cor. 7.


Question.

Does God forbide no more in this commandment, but aduoultrie, fornication
and such kinds of filthiness?

Answer.

When as our bodies and souls are the Churches or Temples of the Holy Ghost,
the will of GOD is, that we should keep them both clean, and hallowed unto

but he understands under the name of theft, all crafty fetches, driftes,
subtle means and ways, whereby we hawke and ly in wait, to take other men's
goods from them, or labor to conuaye them unto us, either by might or
violence or by any false pretense of right, as though we had a just title to
them, and yet have none at al. Such means are false weights, Prou. 11.1. and
16.11.
false yeardes, else, and false measures, Exech. 45.^ etc.
counterfeite and unlawful ware, counterfeite and unlawful money, usury,
Deuteronomy. 25.1^. etc. Psalm. 15.5 Luke 6.35.
and all unlawful means and ways that God has forbidden to get man's living
withal. Hereunto may be put and joined al couetuousnesse 1. Cor. 6.10
and unthrifty and prodigal pouring out, and spending and wasting of Gods
gifts, and evil using of the same. Prou. 5.16.


Question

What are those things which God commands here?

Answer.

That as much as is possible, I should help and increase the goods and profit
of my neighbor. And that I should do so unto him, as I would he should do
unto me, Matt. 7.7.12

and deceiptes, Prou. 12.22 and 13.5.1. Cor 13.6.
as the proper works of the devil, Ioh. 8.44.
except I be disposed to stir up against me, the grievous wrath of God. In
judgments and other matters I shall follow it that is true, and steadfastly
and freely tell and confess the matter as it is in deed, Ephesians. 4.25.
and moreover I shall (as much as I can) defend and increase the good name,
fame, and credit of my neighbors. 1. Pet. 4.8.


Question.

What forbids the tenth commandment?

Answer.

That our hearts should not be moved or stirred up, with so much as with the
least thought or desire, against any of Gods commandments, but that we shall
hate and defy at al times al kind of sin, and shall delight our selves in all
righteousness. Romans 7.8.


Question.

Can they that are turned to GOD keep perfectly, and fully, these
commandementes?

Answer.

No, for even the holiest amongst all men (as long as they live here) have
but small beginnings of this obedience, 1. Ioh. 1.8. Romans 7.14.15 etc. Eccl.
7.21
But yet go so far, that they earnestly (with no feigned desire) begin to
live not only according unto some of these commandments, but according to
all the commandments of God. Romans 7.22. Iac. 10.


Question.

Why will God then that his law should be so earnestly and sharply preached
when there is no man in this life, that is able to keep it?

Answer.

First, that all the time of our life we shall confess and acknowledge 1. Ioh.
1.9 Psalm. 32.5.
how greatly we are disposed of nature to sin, and so thereby that we more
greedelye, and with agreater desire, call for the forgiveness of our sins,
Romans 7.24 25.
and that we should always be occupied in this, that we always be hinking
and recording with our selves of Godliness, and call upon the Father for the
grace of the holy Ghost, that we may be renewed and fashioned to the
likeness of God every day more and more, until at the length, after that we
be departed out of this life: we may with joy and gladness get the full
perfectness, that is proposed, set forth, and required of us. 1. Cor. 9 2.4
Phil. 3.11.12.13.14.


Of prayer.
Question.

Why is prayer necessary for a Christian man?

Answer.

Because it is the chief part of that thankfulness that God requires of us.
Psalm. 50.14 15.
And also because God only gives them his grace and holy spirit, who with
true unfeigned growninges are of him things necessary, and give him thanks for
such benefits as they have received. Matthew. 7 Luke 11.13 Math. 13.12. Psalm.
50.15.


Question.

What things are required in that prayer which shall please God, and be heard
of him?

Answer.

That we should ask of the only true God which has opened himsefe in his
word Ioh. 4.22
all those things which he has commanded to be axed, with a true desire of
the heart, Romans 8.26. 1. Ioh. 5.14 Ioh. 4.23.24. Psalm. 145.18 1.2. Par. 20.12
and an inward feeling of our geggerly need and wretchedness, (c) and cast
our selves down humbly and lowly in the sight of Gods majesty, Psa. 2.11. and
34.19. Ies. 66.2.
and lean to this sure foundation, Romans 10.14 and 8.15. Iac. 1.6

Ioh. 14.13.14.15. and. 15.16 and 16.23. Dan. 9.17.18
as he has promised us in his word. Matthew. 7.8. Psalm. 143.1.

Question.

What is that prayer?

in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us
our dettes, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation. But
deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for
ever and ever. Amen.

Question.

Why does Christ command that we should call God our father?

Answer.

That he might stir up in us even in the very beginning of our prayer, such
reverence as is meet for the sons of God, and a bold trust toward GOD, which
is, to be the ground of our prayer, to wit, that God through Christ is made our
father, and will much less deny unto us those things that we ask of him with
a true faith: then our earthly father will deny unto us earthly things Matthew.
7.9.10.11. Kuk. 11.11.12.13

That we should not think to vylely, basely, or earthly, of his heavenly
