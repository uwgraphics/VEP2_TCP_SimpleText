A Lovers Lamentation to his fair Phillida.
To new Tune.
MY Philida, (...), Love,
And evermore farewell:
I must gee seek a new Love,
Yet will I ring her knell.
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong,
My Phillida is dead:
I Will stick a branch of Willowes
At my farie Phillis head.
Our bridal bed was made,
But my fair Phillida,
Instead of ^^lken shade,
She now lies wrapped in clay.
Ding dong, etc.
Her corpse shall be attended
With Nymphs in rich array,
Till Obsequies be ended,
And my Love wrapped in clay.
Ding dong, etc.
Her Hearse it shall be carried*
With them which do excel:
And when that she is buried,
Thus will I will ring her knell.
Ding dong etc.
I Will deck her Tomb with flowers
The rarest that ere was seen:
And with my tears as showers,
I Will keep them fresh and green.
Ding dong* etc.
In stead of fairest flowers,
Set forth by curious Art,
Her picture shall be painted
In my distressed heart.
Ding dong, etc.
And ever shall be written,
And after shall be said,
True love is not forgotten,
Though Phillda be dead.
Ding dong, etc.
Now ever will I dwell
Where my True-Loue does lie:
And in some darksome Cell,
There will I pine and dye.
Ding dong, etc.
In Sable will I mourn,
The black shall be my weed,
Ah me, I hear some talk,
That Phillida is dead.
Ding dong, etc.
A garland shall be framed,
By Art and Natures skill,
With sundry other flowers,
In taken of good will.
Ding dong, etc.
With sundry colored (...),
As much I will bestow:
They s^^^ld be black and yellow,
In token of my woe.
Ding ding, etc.
True Lovers be not scanting
With tears to make me mourn,
Since Phillida is wanting,
And all my joys are gone.
Ding dong, etc.
She was my only True-Loue,
My heart can witness well:
Wherefore, in sign I love her,
Once more I Will wring her knell.
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong,
My Phillida is dead,
I Will stick a branch of Willowes
At my fair Phillis head.
FINIS.
