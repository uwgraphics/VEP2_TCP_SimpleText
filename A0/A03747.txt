CAllophisus, being brought by the greatest perfection in an other to the
smallest liberty in himself, having the foundation of his choice so firm as
it cannot decay, and finding the place of his imprisonment so strong as he
cannot escape: will be at the Tilts end upon the two and twenty day of January
next ensewing, at one of the Clock in the afternoon, there to defend and
mainetayne against all men whosoever, for six courses a piece, the whole six,
or any of the six Articles which follow, whereunto he challenges all, that
either Honor any Lady, whom they may brag of for any worth: or serve a
Mistress, which has reason to boast of her self for any beauty, by these
first three Articles.

1 The first, that his Mistress is for Beauty of her face, and the Grace of
her person, the most perfect creature, that ever either the eye of man has
beheld, the Art of Nature has framed, or the compass of the earth has
enjoyed. 2 The second, that it is as impossible for any other whosoever, to
abide the beams of his Mistress look, as for the Clouds to endure the
shining and appearing of the Sun, and that the one does not sooner vanish at
the showing of the Sun, then the other will suddenly fade at the presence of
his Mistress, 3 The third, that the perfections of his Mistress, are in
number so infynite, in quality so excellent, and in operation so effectual, as
she by the help of them, and they by the direction of her, do make more men
without liberty, and more bodies without hearts, then any, or all the women in
the world besides.
And because Callophisus douteth that the taking upon him a quarrel which is
so just on his side, will make that he shall have none to defend the contrary
against him, and that the woorthynesse of his mistress will steal away the
Servant of other Ladies, he will with one only assistaunt, challenge all
that either have opinion in the constancy of their love, or assurance in the
greatness of their affection, by these other three Articles.

4 The first, that Callophisus for his faith will yield to none, and for his
loyalty does think himself abooue all, and in these two respects pronounces
himself most worthy to be accepted into favor with his Mistress* or to
receive grace at the hands of the fairest. 5 The second, that the good will and
affection of Callophisus to his Mistress, is for impression so deep, for
continuance so lasting, and for passion so extreme, as it is impossible for
any other to carry so perfect love, or to conceive the like affection. 6 The
third, that those adventures and hazards, which cannot but be most sower, to
any other for the pleasing of any Lady (whom they Honor) are most sweet unto
him, for the contentment of the Mistress whom he serves.
And if they neither will contend with him for the superiority of his
Mistress in woorthynesse, nor for the prerogative of himself in affection,
having not their judgment vayled with so perciall an humor as may lead them
to resist of manifest and open truth, and doubting a bad success in a wrong
opinion, because Veritas vincet omnia, then will he, and his said assistant,
with all such, run six courses, to join with them in honoring of his
Mistress, which has no equal, and expressing of his affection which cannot
be matched.

WHereas this challenge of Justes, was signified by way of devise before her
Majesty, on Twelfe night last past, to have been performed the fifteenth day
of January, her Majesty's pleasure is for diverse considerations, that it be
deferred until the two and twenty of the same month, and then to be held at
Westminster, the accustomed place.
