A disputacio^ of purgatory made by Johan Frith which is divided in to three
books.

The first book is an answer unto Rastell / which goes about to prove
purgatory by natural philosophye.

The second book answers unto Sir Thomas More / which labors to prove
purgatory by scripture.

The third book makes answer unto my lord of Rochestre which most leans
unto the doctoures.

Beware lest any man come and spoil you through philosophye and deceytfull
vanite / through the tradicions of men / and ordinacions after the world / and
not after Christ.

Colossenices. ii.

Johan Frith unto the Christen Reader.
GRace and peace be with the christen reader. I am sure there are many that
will much mer uel and count it a great presumpcion that I being so yon ge
and of so small lerninge da re atte^pte to dispute this matter against these
three personages of the which number two / that is to say my (...) de of
Rochestre and Sir thomas More / are aun cient me^ both of great wit and
dignite. Notwithstondinge I will desire them patiently (...) hear mine answer
/ not aduertysinge who spea keth the words but rathere what is said. And 1.
Tim. 4.
as concerning mine youth / let them remember what paul monischeth. (...).
Timo. (...). willinge that Timothens should instrude the congregation and that
no man should despice his youth for as the sprete of god is bound to no place
/ eue^ so is he not addicre to any age or person / but enspireth when he will
and where he will makin (...) the young to se visio^s and espy the truth / and
^he eldres to dream dreams and to wandre in phantasyes Ades. 2. Joe^. 2.
(...). 2.


And as touching my l^ninge I must needs aknowiege (as the truth is) that it
is verysmal / nevertheless that little (as I am bound / have 1. Lo. 12
I determed / by gods grace) to bestow to the edefyinge of christ's
congregation which I pray god to increase in the knowledge of his word.

I would not that any man should admit my words or lerninge / except they
will stand with the scripture and be approved therbye. Lay them to the
touchstone and try them with gods word. If they be found false and
countrefaite / then dampne them / and I shall also reuo^e them with all mine
heart. But if the scri pture allow them / that you can not deny but it so is /
then reciste not the doctrine of god / but knowledge your ignorance and
seduccion and return gladlye in to the right way. For if you can not improve
it by gods word / and yet / of an hate and malicious mind that you bear
unto the truth labor to resist it and co^ (...) it that it should not sprede:
I ensure you your sin is ^remissible and even agenst the holy ghost / and
the blood of them that perish (...). 33.
for fault of enstruccion shall be required on your hands.

^araduenture some of you will say that your fathers and old (...) with ma
ny holy men and doctoureo have so heleued / and that therefore you will abide
by the old. I an swear: The ways and judgments of god are m^ruelous / who
(...) whethere god have suffered his (...) to err and be seduced for a (...) /
to the (...) that the unfaithful which would not believe the truth but had
pleasure in iniquite might st^ble at their error in to their 1. (...). (...).
(...) confusion and ruin? Al though a man be never so faithful and holy /
yet is there much imperf^ction in him as long as he is included in this
mortal body / how be it it is not imputed unto him / but through the faith in
christ's blood hoellye pacefyed and forgeuen. And there fore it is not sure
that we follow their exterior works or other imaginacions / but let us ever
confer them unto the pure word of god / and as the (...) testefyeth so let
(...) the.

(...) lord of Rochestre does testefye him silfe writing upon the. (...).
article / that there are many points both of the gospels and other scriptures
which are now discussed more (...) lie / and more clerelye vnderstonde^ then
they ha ue been in times past. And adds furthermore that there are diverse
places i^ scripture yet sum deal dark / which he douteth not but that they
shall be more open and light unto our^ posterite / for why shall we despair of
that (says he) since that the scripture is for that intent left with us that
it may be understand of us exactlye and to the vttmost point? Of this may
you euidentl^e perceive that ^he old fathers and holy doctoures have not seen
all the truth. But sumwhat is also left / through the hye provision of god / to
be discussed of their successoures. And therefore is it not mete that we
straight ways cleave unto their words with out any further enserchinge the
scriptures / but we must examine all things by the scriptures although. S.
Paul or Peter should preach it unto us / as we se experience Acts. xvij. that
Acts. 17.
when Paul preached / the audience daily serched the scriptures whether it
were as he said

But you have been of long continuance secluded from the scriptures / which
is the cause of such gross erroures as ye are now fallen in / so that ye
could neither search them / nor yet once look on them. Alas what blindness does
occupye our ey^s? Are ye so childishe to believe that the same word which has
made the unfaithful and heretics / faithful and christen in times past / is
now so far altered that it should cause the faithful and christen to become
he reti^es? I pray god open your eyes. How be it we may now well taste at our
fingres ends that we have long been in that miserable case that Paul
prophesyed upon us. ij. Thessalo. ij. that god has sent us strong delusions
because (...). These. 2
we would not receave the knowledge of the truth: what greater delusion can we
have / then to think that the very word of god / which was written for our
comfort / which is the very fode and sastenaunce of our souls / which is
the sure metyarde and perfeyte touchstone that judges and examineth all
things: Romans 15
to think (I say) that this wholesome word should be our poison and
condempnacyon?

And al be it our forefathers have ly ^ed with out it and received all for
truth that our prelates belyes have imagined: yet is not their fault and ours
a like (although I tan not excuse their ignorance but that it is sin before
the face of god) for they had not the light of gods word opened unto them.
Now since we have the light declared unto us / and yet will proceade in blind
ignorauncye and not co^ ^rre and examine these iuglinge mistes with the light
of gods word / our ignorance is wilful and with out excuse.

Suffer therefore all things what so ever they be / to be tried and examined by
the scripture. If they be true then shall the scripture do them no hurt / but
stablish and strengthen them / for the scripture discloseth nothing but
falsehed / and condempneth nothing but that is damnable.

And now to descend unto our matter and disputacion which is of purgatory /
I shall show you what occasion I had to take it in hand. I wrote a let^ter
unto a certain frynde in england / desyringe him instantlye to send me
certain (...) which I thought necessary for my use and were not to be gotten
in these parties / as the cronicles / Sir Thomas Mores book agenst the
supplicacion of beggars and certain other. These books I re^ upon. S. Thomas
day before Christmas / theyeare of our savior a. M. ccccc. and. XXX. with a
lettre written in this form: Sir I have sent you such books as you wrote for
and one moo of Rastels making / wherein he goes about to prove purgatory /
by natural philosophye: which thing (quod he) I think be more easy to do /
then to prove it by any good scripture. (...). This stuff received / I was
mervelouslye desirous and tickled to se what reasons he brought for his
probacions. And in the beginning and prologe of the book / he set seven
reasons which he said that fond fellows alleged for them to prove that there
could be no purgatory. And in deed they are very fond that would deny
purgatory / if there were no better arguments to confute it then he
assigns. But by gods gra ce I will propounde seven times seven which shall
have such pith / that their paynfull purgatory shall not be able to abide the
worst of them / for these seven that (...) assigns are not worth one been.

Uvhen I had red and well pondered these rea sons / I thought that he should
sharply have confuted them / as he might full well have done / specially
^ith they were but of his own imaginacyon. Nevertheless when I came unto his
solucions I found not one but it had ^erten points repugnaunte unto the
scripture (unto which on^e reason must ever be obe dient) ye and also they
were extremelye iniutious unto christ and his precious blood.

Then left I him / and red sir Thomas Mo^es book / to se what scripture might
be brought for that purposse. And after that made I diliget inquire to come by
my lord of Rochesters book which also writes on the same matter / and when I
had well examined their reasons / and had seen the order and process of the
scriptures (...) gel (...)
which they alleged: I found that clerelye vere fyed which Aulus Gellius
says / that it were
a great deal better for a man to be sharpe^ lie rebuked ye and openly to
have his fautes published of his enemy / then to be coldlye and slenderlye
praised of his friend. For a man's enemy ensercheth narowlye and gathers to
gi there all that he can imagyne / and so accuses (...) man more of a fumous
heat then of any verite: and therefore the audience (if they be wise) con sidre
his words thereafter / and so give very small credence or else none unto them.
But if a m^nnes frinde before audience do praise him slenderlye and coldlye /
it is an argument that the person is very fautye / for a frinde beholds al
qualityes and circumstaunces / his birth bringinge up / and what feats he
has done all his liffe long: ye and applies many things unto his frindes
praise / which serve but smallye for it / for he will leave nothing behind
that may he imagened to employe his friends fame and honor. Now if in all
these poyn res he can not color out a glorious apparent laud / but is
compelled for lack of matter to praise his frinde slenderlye / then (if the
audien ce be wise) they may sone conjecture that he is no praise worthy / and
also may well doubt whether that small praise which he gave him be true or
not. Even so / when I had red these books of Sir Thomas More and my lord of
Rochestre / and saw the small probacions and ^lender reasons that those two
wittye and learned men had brought to confirm purgatory / consideringe also
that they are the chefest frindes / proctoures and patrones thereof / and that
they had applied many reasons and scriptures for their pourposse (for lack of
matter) that rather made agenst them / ye and not that only / (...)
but also that they dissented between the^ selves More and my lord of (...)
stre can not agr^.
in their probacions / for. M. More says that there is no water in
purgatory. And my lord of rochestre saves that there is water there. Master
More says that the ministres of the punishment are deuels. And my lord of
rochestre says that the ministres of the punishment are angels. master More
says that both the grace and cherite of them that lie in the pains of
purgatory / are in creased. My lord of To / chestre says that the souls in
purgatory on tayne there neither more faith nor grace nor cherite then they
brought in with them. These things considered / it made mine heart yerne and
fullye to consent / that this their paynfull purgatory was but a vain
imaginacion / and that it has of long time but deceived the people and mi^ed
them from their monye. The purgatoryes that god has orde ned


Notwithstondinge god has left us two pur gato^yes. One to purge the heart
and cleanse it from the filth which we have partelye received of Adam (for we
are by nature the children of wrath Ephe. ii) and partlye added thereto by
co^sentinge unto our natural infirmite. This pur Joan. 15.
gatorie is the word of god as christ says Io. The purgatory of (...) heart.
xv. Now are ye clean for the word which I ha ue spoken unto you. This
purgacio^ obtayneth no man but through faith / for the unfaithful are not
purged by the word of god / as the scribes and pharisees were nothing the
better for hea ringe his word but rather the worse for it was a testimonye
agenst them unto their condemnacion. And because we receive this purgacion
only through beleuinge the word / therefore is the virtue of this purginge
applied also unto (...). 15.
faith / for Peter says Ac. xv. that the ge^tles har (...) were purged through
faith, / that is to say / through beleuinge the word. And what word is that?
verelye the preachinge that christ's deeth has fullye fatisfyed for our
sins and pacefyed forever the fathers wrath towar des us. (...). This faith
purefyeth the heart and gives us a will and gladness to do what so ever our
most merciful father commands us. Nevertheless because our infirmit^e is
so great and our members so weak and frail that we can not (...) pur (...)
of (...)
eschew sin as our heart would and as our will desires: therefore has god
left us a no there purgatory which is christ's cross. I mean not his
materyal cross that he him silfe died on / but a spretuall cross which is
aduersite / tribulacion / worldly depression. (...). And this is called the
rod or scourge of god wherewith he scourges every son that he receaueth /
that (...). (...).
we may remember his law and mortefye the old Adam and fleshlye lust which
else would wate so rebellious that it would subdue us / rai ^ne in us and hold
us thraulde under sin. when so ever we have committed a crime theu ^sal. 89
is god present with this rod as he says psalm lxxxix. If they defyle my
ceremonies and donot observe my commaundmentes / then with a rod shall I punish
their sins and with beatinges shall I reward their iniquityes / but yet my
mercy shall I not take from him neither will I deceive him of my promise.

This (...) must we receave with a glad heart and thank our lovinge father
for it / for it is but a medicyne to healc our infirmitye and to subdue our
rebellious members. But when our members are fullye mortefyed / that is / when
deeth has subdued our corruptible body / and our flesh committed to rest in
the earth / then cease the purgatoryes that god has ordained / and then are we
fullye purged in his sight.

If our clergy could have found in their hearts to have taken these
purgatoryes upon the / they had never neded to imagine any other but since
their li^e begane to wax so dissolute / specially since they should ^e the
salt of the earth and lantrens of light: It was necessary for the^ to imagyne
a purgatory after this li^e / for else they might be sure that the most part
of them were never like to come in heaven.

Judge (...) reader which have the sprete to discern and know the voice of
christ what reasons rastell has brought and how he has soluted them. for in
my mind both his reasons and solucyons are so childysh and unsavory / so
unlearned and bare^ / so full of fautes and pha^ rasyes / that I rather pitye
the man's (...) ignorance and blindness (which has so deceived him self
through phylosophye and natural reason) then I fear that he by his vain
probacyons should allure any man to consent unto him.

Judge and confer the scryptures which Sir thomas More and my lord of
Rochestre allege for their oppinion / and I doubt not but that god shall open
thine eyes to espy that thin ge which has blinded them.

Judge and compare the scriptures to gether which I have brought to confyrme my
purposse. ponder their reasons and my solucyons unto them / and I am sure thou
shall perceive that my small lerninge has conde^pned their hye eloquence /
that my folly has brought to naught their wisdom / and that my youth has
disclosed their old and festred ignorance.

And this is even the old practyse of god: to chose the folysh things of the
would: to con found the wise. to chose the weke / to confou^de the mighty:
And to chose the vile things whi ch are of no reputacyon: to confound them of
hye degree: that no flesh might bost it self in his sight to whom only be
praise and thanks for ^uer.

Amen.
A prologe. wherbye a man may the better percea ue the occasyon and hole cause
of this book.
There was a brother of ours named Symo^ Fysh (which now I trust rests in
gods hands) whose yies god had opened / not (...) to (...) the wily
walkinge of hypocrites and ruin of the royalme which through their means was
nigh at hand: but also to mark and pondre the peril of me^nes souls / and
how that the ignoraunte people by their seduccio^ was fall len in to that
frantic ymaginacyon that they more feared the pope and his decrees which are
but vanite / then god him self and his law which are most rightwyse and
eternal. This man the fore of a fervent and burning zele that he bare to the
wealth of the cominaltie, brake out and tou ched these hypocrytes in a little
treatise which he called / the supplicacion of beggars / willing that we
should give the abundaunce of our (...) chesse unto the poor to whom yt is
due by the law of god: and that we should no longer suffer our selves to be
dyspoyled and robbed of a sight of sturdye lubbarres which under a false cloak
of virtue and prayer deceive the poor of their living and both the poor and
the rych of their souls health / if credence be given unto them.

And where these wilye foxes would have (...) tendyd the cloak of purgatory
affirminge that it were due unto the^ because they pray for their friends
souls that they might come to rest / he answered unto that point preue^tinge
their obieccyon / and proved that either there could be no such purgatory /
or else that the pope were a merciless tyraunte which (as he says him silfe)
may deliver them from thence and will not except he have monye. At this
point begane. M. More to fume and took upon him silfe to be proctoure for
purgatory (I will not say that he was hired thereto of our spiritualtye al
though many men dare swear it) and to conferme his purposse he wrested sore the
scriptures / and tryumpheth also that the very miscreauntes and idolatres
believe that there is a purgatory He adds thereto (to stablysh his matter with
all) that there is no man which believes that there is a god and that the soul
of man is immortal / but he must neades grant that there is a purgatory.
There took Rastell his hold / (...)
which is a prenter dwellinge at poules gate in london and of master Mores
allyaunce / which also coucteth to country fair his kinseman / although the
beams of his brains be nothing so radiaunte nor his conueyaunce so
commendable in the yies of the wise. Notwithstanding this Rastell has
enterprised to dilate this matter / and has divided it in to iii. dyaloges /
imagininge that two me^ dispute this matter by natural reason and phylosophye
secludynge Christ and all scripture. The one of them (that should dyspute this
matter) he calls Ginge min / and fayneth him to be a (...) and of Ma hometes
law. The second he names Comin go an almayne and of Christ's faith. And he
ma^eth the turcke to teach the christen man what he should believe.

^he first dialoge goes about to prove by rea son that there is a god / which
is merciful and ryghtwyse. The second entendeth to prove / that the soul of
a man is immortal. Agenst the se two dyaloges I will not dispute / partlye be
cause this treatise should not be over long and tedyous / and partlye because
that those two points which he there labors to prove are soch as no
christen man will deny (although many of his probacyons are so slender that
they may well be improued) but as cocerninge his third dyaloge wherein he
(...) prove pur gatorye / it is hoellye miuryous unto the blood of Christ and
the destruccyon of all christen faith / yfmen were so mad as to believe his vay
ne persuasyons. And therefore I thought it expe dyent to compare this third
dyaloge with all the deceytfull reasons unto the true (...) and pure word of
god that at the lest Rastell him self might perceive his own blind
ignorance and return again in to the right way. And if any man have been
deceived through his book (as I trust there are but few except^ they be very
ignoraunte) that they may repent with him and glorefye go^ for his in
estimable mercy which has sent his light in to this world to dysclose and
expel their dark and blin de ignorauncye / that they may se his ways and
walk in the^ praysinge the lord eternallye.

Amen
The first book which is an an swear unto Rastels dialoge.
THere is no man as I think that has a natural wirte / but he will grant me
that this book of Rastels making is either true or false. If it be false /
then how so ever it seem to agree with natural reason it is not to be allowed:
if it be true / then must we approve it. Natural reason must be ruled by
scripture If natural reason conclude agenst scripture / so is it false / but
if it be agreynge to scripture then is it to be hard.

Of this may I conclude that if Rastels book be agreinge to scripture / then
is it true and to be allowed / if it determe contrary to the scripture then is
it false and to be abhorred / how so ever it seem to agree with natural reason.

Now is there no christen man but he believes surely that if Christ had not
dyed for our sin nes we should all have been dampened perpetuallye and never
have entered in to the joys of heaven / which thing is easy to be proved. for
paul says Roma. 5. As through one man's (...)
sin that is Adam / ensued death in all men unto condemnacyon: Even so through
one man's right wisnes which is christ / came right wysnes in all men unto the
iustificacyon of life. Also Jo. 11.
Johan. xi. It it necessary that one man dye for the people / that all the
people perish not: so that we had been condemned and had perished perpe
tuallye if christ had not died for us. But Rastel with his turcke Gingemin
exclude Christ and know not of his deeth / wherefore all the reasons that they
can make unto domesdaye can never prove purgatory (except they imagyne that
we must first go to purgatory and then after (...) hell) for this is a plain
conclusion that with

Not with stondinge I will not thus leave his book / although I might full well
/ but I will declare unto you what solucyons he makes to these seven weak
reasons which he has propounded him silfe. for he auoydeth the^ so slenderlye
/ that if a man had any doubt of purgatory before / it would make him swear
on a book that there were none at al. Besides that it has not onesolucio^ but
there are in it certain points repugnaunte unto scripture / so that it is
great shame that any christian man should pre^ te it / and much more shame that
it should be prented with the kings privilege.

The first and chefest reason that moves this man (ye and all other) to
affirm purgatory is this / which he puts both in the first chaptre o^ his
third dialoge and also in the last Man (says he) is made to serve and
honor (...)
god / now if man be negligent about the commaundmentes of god and commit
some venial sin for which he ought to be punyshed by the justice of god and
dye suddenly with out repentance and have not made suffycyent satisfaccyon
unto god here in the (...) / his sou le ought neither immediatlye to come in to
the glorious place of heaven because it is sum what defouled with sin /
neither ought it to go to hell unto eternal dampnacy on: bu^ by all good (...)
of justice / that soul must be pu^ g^d in a another place to make (...) for
those effences / that it may afterward be rece^ued in to the glorious place
of heaven And so by y^ iusti ce of god there must needs he a purgatory.

(...) this reason has ^ome apperaunre (...)
of truth and the similitnde of Wi^dom / how be it in deed it is nothing but
man's imaginacy on and fantasy. For if we compare it unto ^od des word then
vanishes it away / But we re guard not the word of the lord / and therefore
chances even the same thing unto us / that happened before unto the children
of Israel. psalm 81. My people regarded not my voice and (...).
Israel gave no head unto me: therefore let I the^ go after the appetites of
their own hearts They shall wandre in thyer own imaginacio^s Now what go they
about in this their inuencyon and imaginacyo^ of purgatory / but to pon dre
the: ustice of god in the balance of man's justice (...) / (...) is no reason
that we should enter in to heaven which have not here satisfy (...) unto god

heaven / and these persons are yet spotted with sin and have neither place
nor space to purge them in: you must needs conclude whether you will or not
that they must all be dampened and yet you think that unreasonable to.

Se: whether your arguments of natural reason bring you. But what says
the scripture? verelye paul. i. thessa. 4. espied a another way: for he
says: and so shall we ever be with the lord: and not dampened. Of this ^aye
we undentlye conclude / that some shall be saved although they be sinners and
never come in purgatory (there takes Rastell a fall and all his fautours)
and since god is as just and merciful now as he shall be the^: why shall we go
more in to purgatory the^ they? but mark I pray you how properlye that
substancyall reason wherewith they go about to stablish purgatory concludes:
which condempneth in to hell so many thousands / ye and even them whom paul
af firmeth to be saved. And yet at the beginning it seemed very reasonable.

Now have I proved you sufficientlye that this their reason can prove no
purgatory / for as I sai^d there shall sinuers enter in to heaven and never
come in purgatory. Here paraduen^ure you be desirous to know how gods iusti
ce is pacefyed. For all sin by y^ justice of god must needs be punyshed. Now
can the world espy no punishment here / and therefore they thought it
necessary to imagine a purgatory to pur ge and punish sin. Here answer I
with paul christ the son of god being the bryghtnes of his glory and very
image of his substance Hebre. (...).
power / has in his own person purged our sin nes and is set on the right
hand of god. Behold the true purgatory and consuminge fire which has fullye
burnt up and consumed our^ sins / and has for ever pacefyed the fathers
wrath toward us. Mark how he says that Christ in his own person has
purged our sin nes. If thou yet seek another purgacyon / then art thou
iniuryous unto y^ blood of christ. For if thou thought his blood sufficient
then wol dest thou seek no another purgatory / but give him all the thanks and
all the praise of thy ho le health and salvation and rejoice hole in y^ lord.

Paul writes. ephe. 5. on this manner / Christ Ephe. 5.
of water through y^ word / to make it unto him self a glorious congregation
with out spott or wrincle or any such thing / but yt it should be ho lie and
with out blame. Now if Christ by these me anes have sanctefyed it and made it
with out spot te / wrincle and blame / the^ were it against all right to cast yt
in to purgatory / wherefore I must needs conclude yt either paul says not
true which affermeth y^ christ has so purged his co^greg^ cion / or else yt
Christ is vnrightwyse if he cast the^ in to purgatory which are with out
spotte wrincle and blame in his sight

Paraduenture some man will think mine arguments to be of small pith / and to
dissolve them by a dystinctyon saying / it is truth that god has so purged
and cleansed us from all ou re iniquytes / nevertheless his mercy / purginge
and forgiveness have only purefyed us from the fault and crime / but not from
the pain which is due to the crime.

To this obie^tyon I answer / that if god ofhys mercy and through the blood
of his son Jesus have not remitted ye pain due unto ye cry me / then shall
we all be dampened. for the pain due unto everye dysobedyence that is against
god / is eternal dampnacyon. And therefore if this pain were not forgeuen us /
then are we still under condempnacyon / and so were christ's blood shed in
vain / and could save no man

If they will say that this everlasting Obiec^y (...)
pain is not hoellye forgeuen us / but that ^t is altered in to the temporal
pain of purga torye / out of which the pope may deliver them by his pardon /
for else have they no evasio^ at all / then may we sone confute them and that
by d^ verse reasons.

first / that their words are nothing but even their own imaginacion / for
they can not confirm their saynges by the scripture / neither ought we to
accept any thing as an article of our faith which is not approved by god
des word: for we may neither declyne unto the right hand nor unto the lift:
but only do that the lord commands us deuteronomye 4. 5. 12. 13.

And again / if a man should ask them by what auctorite the pope gives such
pardon.

Besides that / everye Christen man ought to apply unto god al things which
should employe his honor as far forth as the scripture scripture ymagyne
that he has not delivered us from the pain as well as from the sin?

Moreover / if he should reserve the pain /

How be it (to say truth) there is no man yt can tak^ any such profitte of
them that me^ feign to ^e punished in purgatory. For we neither se it nor
hear it / neither have we any me^ ^yon made of it in scripture / that we may
be su re that it so is. Now since we have no infallible evide^ce / but only
fantastical imaginacio^s / it (...) pla^ne enough that there was no such
thing orleyned neither to avaunce gods honor nor yet to the profit of the
cominaltye or else of gods elect / for then I am sure that Christ and all his
apostles would not hau^ forgoten to have remembered us of it.

NOw let us se some of rast^ls reasons which ^e says that fond fellows lay
for them selves to prove that there should be no purgatory.

They say / (says Rastell) that contricion R^stels first argu meant
which some call repentance is that which is the very payment and
satisfaccion for sin / and they say that when a man commits a sin and
after is repentaunte therefore / that god of his goodness does forgive him and
tha^ that repentance is the only satisfaccion that god would have made and
done for that sin. And then since a man by such repentance has made such
payment and satisfaccion for his sin ne as god would have to be made therefore /
if the^ that man should go to purgatory and have a new punishment after his
deeth that repentance that he had before should be but void.

^orsouth I think that neither Rastell Frith
ever hard any such reason / neither yet that any man ever would be so fond
as to say that this argument confuted purgatory / except it were one that
were clean purged of his wit before. But whose reason so ever it be / whether
Rastels or any other man's / let us lay it un to the touchstone / that is the
scripture / to prove whether it be gold or copper / upright or coun trefayte /
truth or untruth. And to be short the first proposicion and Mayor of his
reason is this that contricion or repentance is the very pay meant and
satisfaccion for sin. That is a starcke lie to begin with all. For if we by
all our contricion / repentance / sacrifices and works (I add more to help
him) can fullye pay and satisfye for our sins / then is Christ deed in
vain and might full well have spar^d his blood. This can no man deny / but
he that will set at naught both Christ and all the scripture. Rast^.
Now mark how he proceadeth. And they say (says Rastell) that when a man
commits a sin and after is repentaunte therefore / that god of his
goodness does forgive him / and that that repentance is the only
satisfaccion that god would have to be made and done for that sin.

This is the next part of his argument and contains Frith.
two lies at once cheyned to gether / for where he says that when a man
committeh a sin and after is repentaunte therefore that god of his goodness
does forgive him: you must first consider that neither he nor his turcke
Gingemin know any thing of christ Now if it were not for Christ's sak / all
the repentaun ce that man can imagyne could not move the goodness of god to
forgive one sin. But by his justice (where Christ's deeth has not effect)
he must needs condemn. The second lie is this / that that repentance is the
only esatisfac cion that god would have made and done for yt sin / for if
this be true / then is our faith falfe. For our faith holds that if Christ
had not dyed for us / we had all perished. Then proceadeth he as though all
that he had said before were true / on this manner. And the^ (says he) since
Rastell
a man by such repentannce has made such pay meant and satisfaccion for his
sin as god would have to be made therefore / If then that man should go to
purgatory and have a new punisment after his deeth / that repentance that he
had before should be but void. Eve^ just / if hea ven fell we should catch
larkes.

Now let us se how properlye he answers Frith.
unto his own question. And you shall find mo blasphemies agenst Christ in
his answer then preceded in his argument. Think you this man has not taken
great pains?

To prepare him silf unto his matter he brin Three lies atonce.
geth in three lies in the first chaptre. The first is he says that only the
soul suffers and not the body / and makes Comingo / whom he fay neth to be
a Christian man / to grant it well and wyselye. Forsouth this is new lerninge
in deed. For if this be true / the^ Christ's body suffered no harm / neither
when he was scourged / ne^yther when he was crouned with thorn neither when he
was nailed on the cross. But I repor te me unto your own selves if ye cut
but your fingre / feel ye no pain? and yet I think ye will not say that ye
cut your soul From hence forward if you se a poor man shyveringe for cold
in the streate / you may bid him walk a knave and bear him in hand that he
fealeth no harm / for as this man says his bo dye fealeth no harm / and I
promysse you of ho neste that his soul catches no cold. But what need I to
make mowordes of this matter since you may make experience your selves? The
second lie is this. That man was created of god to do him honor and service.
For if a man may say the truth man was not made for the intent to be a
servaunte and do service. For god has no neade of our service but was in as
full honor and as well served before the world begane as he now is. So that
his honou re / joy and service is hole in him silfe / and is by us neither
employed nor diminished.

But the cause why he made man was this that man should have the fruicyon of
his joy why man was made
and honor. Soch was his goodness / he made us not that he should have any
pleasure by us / but that we should have pleasure by him. The third lie is
this / that no another creature here in earth does service and honor unto god
but only man. This is also a stark lie: for all creatures honor god through
their creacion and being / for ye hole glory of their creacion redou neth in
to the honor of god / and what service can they do better then so to glorefye
god? Ney there yet lett^th he them be idle but works tho row them mervelous
things and all to his glo rye. Fire at his co^maunde^e^t came down from Gene.

was this no honor and service? But a man may se that his wit was so purged
in purgatory / that he has not one drop left to espy any truth at all.

But yet let us se how he answers the argument / and severallye examine
everye part. The first part was: that contricion or repentance is the very
payment and satisfaccio^ for Rastell.
sum. To this he answers / that when thou ta kest repentance and ask
mercy of god for thy ne offense: No man ought to be so folishe to think that
god should be restrained or compelled / but that it is at his liberty whether
he will for give or no.

I would be loath to move the man and ask (...).
him what repentance is? for surely as far as I can gether by his words he
wott^th nothing what it means. But I pray you se how substanciallye he
answers the argument It argues that contrieyon or repentance is y^ very
payment and satisfaccion for sin. And to that answers he neither ye nor
nay / for ^eare of trappinge (albeit the words are clean agenst scripture)
But he answers that when thou take repentance and ask mercy of god for
thy sin: no man ought to be so folish to think that god should be
constrained or compelled to forgive the. But for all that this is su re yuough
that if repeutaunce be the very pay meant and satisfaccion for sin (as y^
argument falslye supposes) that god of his justice must needs forgive me when
I repent. For then he^ ue I hoellye paid him his and may require my right
even by his justice. If thou obiecte y^ god were then restreyned and compelled
/ I answer nay. But it were rather a great pleasure unto him to forgive all
men if so they could make satisfaccion unto his justice by tepentaun ce / for
he reioyseth not in punishinge us. Then Rastell.
adds Rastell that it is at his liberty always to execute justice or mercy
at his pleasure. To yt I answer / yt he has no pleasure to do against Frith.
his scripture / but therein has he fullye opened his pleasure. His pleasure is
to forgive frelye al them yt believe in his son Christ Jesus / and to condemyne
them yt beleu^ not. If Rastell mean on this facio^ then grant we him. But if
h^ understand that god takes his pleasure and libe^ tie in ministringe his
mercy and justice / so yt he may condemn him which has geven y^ very
payment and full satisfaccion of sin (as it seameth he should mean seigne he
denies not y^ first part of y^ argument) and again save him that beleved not
/ then will I say y^ Rastel run neth ryotte and takes his own pleasure. For
god has no power agenst him silse and his scripture / but look what he has
promised and y^ he will perform. And therefore in this ea^ Rastell prove no
purgatory for all that he grondeth him on so many lies. But yet is it
necessary that we declare unto you what is the very^ satisfaccion for sin
and the^ shall we se whether purgatory may st^nde with it or not.

Paul says Hebre. x. that Christ with one Heb. 10.
of Christ Jesus which was once done (upon the cross) and with that one
oblacion has he made them which are hallowed perfeyte for ever. Now if this be
true that we are made perfey t^ by the oblacyon of his own body upon the
cross / then is purgatory in vain. For if he ha ue so purged us / what need
we a another purgacion? If we be made perfeyte through him what need we after
this liffe to be purged? If he have satisfied for us / why seek we a another
satisfaccion? why leave we the fontayne of livinge water and seek our
refreshinge out of polluted pooles and specially since the heedspringe is so
ready at hand?

If we must make satisfaccion unto god for

Now makes he Comingo his almayne to bring in an ensample / and in confutinge
that he thinks to win the field. But we will she we you that his similitude
is nothing like in de de. But if he will imagine that it be like / the^ does he
not confute it but makes it stronger. The ensample is this: If I owe the an C.

this: that contricio^ or repentance is the very payment and satisfaccion for
sin. Therefore if he will have it like then must he suppose that this humble
request of forgevenes / discharge and pardon is the very payment and
satisfaccion for that. C. li. and therefore upon y^ should they first have
agreed or else can the example serve for nothing. Now if he make them like and
imagine that this hum ble desire of forgiveness is the very payment and
satisfaccion for that. C. li. then has he made a rod for his own arse / for
he shall never be able to avoyde it. But let us se his answer. In the case

and our hurt and hinderaunce if we ask it not. If Iowe a man xx. pound y^
le^ger I keep it the more is my profit and the more his loss: but god
receaveth us young / he receaveth us at man's state / he receaveth us old /
and thinks it no loss or hurt then to receave us / for he says by his
prophet.

The wykednes of the wyked shall not hurt Eze. 33
hurt him if he should broyle in purgatory for it. wherefore either there is
no soch pain full purgatory / or else can not I se how the pro phete / which
speaks these words in y^ person of god / should be true.

god the father) and you shall be cleansed from all your iniquytyes Ezechie.

I will be merciful unto their wykednes / and their sins will I no more
remember Hieremie. Hier. 31.
our sins any more / the^ may we be sure that he will not frye us in y^
fire of purgatory for our sins.

NOw let us se his second argument which The second argument Rastel
is in the fourth chaptre / and is surely fon de / how be it his solucio^ is
yet more folysh. The some of his argument is this.

Dan was made and ordained to have an in finite being / therefore after this
mortalite and deeth he must have ifinite joy or infinite pain

I will put you a like argument. A man is or Fr^th.
deyned in this world to be a king or a subject therefore after he is borne
he is ever a king or ^s ever a subject. Now may this be false / for
paradventure he may be borne a subject and after made king or else he may be
borne a kin ge and after deposed and made a subject. There fore this argument
holds not formallye. But it holds on this manner / as I should say to an
ape: thou must needs be an ape or an ass / which now is true. But if I should
say the very
same words to Master Johan Rastell / I think he would be angrye and say
that it we re false. And I suppose our scolemen will say that he lies / and
put him an ensample of the en^auntes that dye with out christndome / which (as
the scoleme^ say) shall never have joy nor pain. But I will grant him his
argument to se how properlye he will confute it.

Now mark his answer which stondeth in the. v. chaptre

There are degrees in sins / some sins are Rastell.
great and some greater / and therefore must there be degrees in punishment /
some punishment is great and some greater. (...) for your ple asure I ^m
content to grant you this to But Frith.
else were it a matter worthy disputacion what now?

(...) that a man (says Rastel) here in earth Rastell.
has committed a great sin and offense and taken repentance wherbye the
sin is forgeven (mark that he being ignorant of Christ / says through
repentance the sin is forgeven) and yet has not taken such suffycyent
repentance therefore / nor had any suffycyent punishment which should make a
full payment and satisfaccio^ for that sin / and dies before any condign or
full satisfaccio^ made / god must then of his rightwysnes ordeyne a place of
pur gatorye / where his soul shall have a further pu nishment to make a
condign and full satis faccion for that sin / and so to be purged and
purefyed before it shall be able and worthy to be ad mitted to receave the
eternal joy in heaven.

First brethren you must grant / that we Frith
have a Christ or no Christ: a redemer or no re^ mer: a iustefyer or no
iustefyar. If there be none such (as Rastell with his turcke Gingemin suppose)
then all the repentance in the world coul de not satisfye for one sin / but
whosocuer co^ mitted a sin should be dampened therefore. So that Rastell
speaks and seyth al in diminutyues / for where he should of truth spy hell /
the re espyeth he but purgatory. And where he should say that al sinners (if
they stick not to Christ's blood) shall be dampened eternallye / there says
he that they shall be punished in pur gatorye. And to be short / if Rastell say
truth the^ is Christ deed in vain: If he say not truth why stick you to his
reason? But paraduentute thou that know Christ wilt say (as many do) that
Christ's deeth and redemption serves the but for original sin / or at most
for those sins that thou committedst before baptyme. To that I answer with.
S. Joan.

Children / this do I write unto you y^ ye sin 1. Joan. 2.
wrote not unto the christen and them that were all ready baptized? And yet he
said if any man sin / we have an advocate with the father / Ie sus Christ
which is rightwys^: and he it is that obtayneth grace for our sins. Loo he
adnum breath him (...) also: for he says we have an ad vocate: and says
again / for our sins. ^e may se that he means not only original sin ne
/ neither yet the sins done before baptyme: for I doubt not but he was
baptized when he wrote this pistle / and yet said he: if we sin (meaning
after baptyme or when so ever it be) we have an advocate with the father /
Ihesus Christ / this is. S. Ioans lerninge: he knew no another remedy if we
fell in to sin / but only Christ. Not withstandinge our prelates have
pactized further / for they say: if any man sin he shall lie in the pains
of purgatory / until he be delivered thence by mass pence / the popes pardon
or certain other suffragyes / but not with out Monye you may be sure.

Christ says (no man comes unto the father Jo^. 13
but through me Johan. xiii. for (says he) I am the way. yes lord / our
prelates have espied a another way / which although it be more pain full unto
the poor / yet is it more profitable for the prelates.

Come unto me all ye that labor and are Mat. 11
Christ Jesus. Matthei. xi. will thou send us lor de in to purgatory? forsouth
there is little ease / if the fire be so hot as our prelates have feigned it.

It is even I that put out thine iniquytyes Esa^e. 43.
thy sins will I no more remember Estate. (...). Ergo then he puts them
not a way for broylinge in purgatory. He adds also that he will no more
remember our sins: call ye that no remembrance to cast us in to purgatory
for them?

whom god predestined / them he called / and Romans 8.
he with them then? Did he cast them in to purgatory there to be cleansed?
forsouth the apostle makes no mention thereof / but adds immedi atlye / whom
he iustefyed them he glorefyed Romano. vii^. wherefore let not us put such
obstacles and be v^kinde unto the gracious favor of god.

Besides that Paul forbids us to be ca refull for them that sleep (that is
to say for the 1. These. 4
in such miserable tourmentes. Now saying he had occasion to make mencyon of
the deed / and spoke not one word of purgatory / it is playue enough yt he
knew nothing of it or else was he very negligent to ouerhippe it. But yet had
I lever say that purgatory were but a phantasye of man's imaginacyo^ / then
to ascribe such forget tefulnes or negligence unto that Apostle.

The third reason that Rastell allegeth is in The third argument
y^. vi. chaptre / yt sum is this. There are degres of joy in heaven / and
degres of pain in hell. And therefore god may pass every man and give him
according to his deserte / other more or less and never need purgatory. well
letvs grant these degres for Rastels pleasure although the questyon be so
dysputable that I am sure he can not defend it. what follows on this?
forsouth he brings in proper exem ples if they could serve for the purpose.
But let us pass over to his solucyon which is in the end of the seventh
chaptre.

When a man says Rastell is infected whith Rastell
a great mortal sin and so depart / then his soul ought not to do service
in heaven unto god because it is putrefyed with that foul sin. But if that
man had taken the medicyne of full repentance in his lyffe / that medycyne
would have restored him again to his soul health and virtue (But here you must
remember that christ Frith
is deed in ^ayne / for if repentance be the medy cyne that restores again
the health and virtue of the soul / what neadeth Christ) Now forth But if he
have taken (says Rastell) some repentance Rastell
for that sin and not suffycyent / and had not sufficye^t time to make
sufficye^t satisfaccy on therefore / yet by the taking of that medicyne of
repentance / that sin is expelled and gone / and the soul of that
syckenesse and sin is clerelye hole / but yet the spots and tokens of the
sin which is a deformyte to the soul do slily remain till the soul have a
time to be purged from those tokens and spots to ma ke it pure and clean of
that deformyte. Frith


This man is ever in one supposicio^ which is both false and iniuryous unto the
precious blood of Christ. I wondre who taught him yt conclusyon / and why he
grants so sone un to it / for he would not have it granted that there were
a god / neither that the soul was immortal (although they were both true)
until he had proved it (as he thought him self) by good natural reason. But
as for this that is starcke false (that is to say) that repentaunc^ while he
excludes christ / does satisfy for our sin / he never puts in questyon
/ but grants it by and bye / be like the turckes have such an opinion. But
let him go with his turcke / and let us christen men grant nothing contrary
to the scripture / but ever captiuate our reason unto that / for it is the
infallible reason and wysdom of god / and passes our reason farre^

THe fourth reason is propounded in the The fourth argument
viii. chaptre. which is this / yt the soul unpurged may do some mean and
low service to god in heaven / though it be not the hiest Ephe. 5.
and best. which thing is false and agenst scripture. Ephe. 5. Cant. 4. But
let us se what Canti. 4^
answer he makes unto it. His answer begins Rastell
in the. ix. chaptre / and the sum is this

Heaven is so pure and clean of nature. that yt must expel all manner of
impuryte and uncleanness / neither can yt suffer any thing the rin / that is of
any manner uncleanness or evil / or other thing unpleasant. So now it
follows that when a man has committed a mortal sin and after takes
repentafice by yt which he is healed of yt foul infi^nite (Se how he harpeth

I answer that yt remains every whytte / sin / spots / tokens / and all

Then what needs purgatory?

THe fifte argument that he brings against The fifte argument Rastell
purgatory is touched in his tenth Chaptre / the sum is this. It should seem
convenie^t that this purgatory (if there were one) should be in earth: partlye
because the bodyewhich offends with the soul might be purged with the soul:
and partly^ to be a good ensample to all men lyvinge to put them in fear to do
any like offense / and so should cause many to abstain from committinge any
such like offense and sin ne / or else where should purgatory be?

This reason has no great pith. Notwithstondinge Frith.
if it were well prosequuted / it would be to hard for Rastell to avoyde it.
For this is no formal argument / it is mete that the body which offends
with the soul should be purged with the soul / ergo purgatory must be upon
the earth. For god may join the body and sou le to gether again after they
be departed and so punish them to gether although purgatory were not in earth /
even where so ever it be. And therefore thus me thinks it should well follow.

The body was follow and pertener with the soul in committinge the crime and
sin / is prepared for them that love god. wherefore it is reason if the soul
should be purged and punished in purgatory: yt y^ body should also suffer with
him in purgatory: feign yt place of purga torie where you will / in heaven /
in earth or in hell But wotte ye what Rastell would here say unto me? for south
even as he did in the first cha pitre of the third dialoge. that is to say:
he would stoutelye affirm that the body suffers another well nor woo / joy
nor pain / good nor evil / and therefore it needs not go to purgatory. And
by that reason it is folly that the body should go either to heaven or hell.
for it ney there fealeth pleasure nor pain. this is new lerninge in deed. But
I think there is no chri sten man so folish as to believe him.

And as for the second point that it should be a good ensample to put men in
fear for co^mittinge such trespaces / it were sone answe red For we ought not
to abstain from euel be cause of the punishment that follows the crime but
only for the love that we have unto god with out any respect either of
saluacyo^ or of damnacyon. If thou abstain for fear / so art thou under the
law and under condemna cion: The law of god and the law of man are far
unlike. for the law of man is fulfilled by the exterioure act although the
heart be far from it. As if I owe a man. xx. pound and be compelled by the
law to pay him at a certain day: if I them pay it albeit mine heart be ne
uer so grugginge and evil willinge / yet have I fulfilled the law so that
there shall no process or sentence pass agenst me. But gods law requires
a thing to be done with a well willin ge heart / and even for pure love. for if
thou do it for fear or un willinglye that shall be imputed unto the for sine.
If thou do it for fear / the^ workest thou not of love / but rather hate
both the thing that thou do / and also the law that constrayneth the unto
it. And if thou do it unwillingly then willest thou to do the contrary / and
so would thou that there were no such la we neither yet any god that should
judge the in so doing. And since god judges the after thine heart and will /
then must he needs condemn the. for thou willest contrary unto his law and
will: ye and willest in thine heart contrary to that thou do in thine out
ward deed.

Now let us se his solucyon which is in the xi. chaptre and so folish / that if
it were not for the great length of the chaptre / for loss of time and for
the more cost in prentinge / I would surely have answered unto it at length /
even that he should have been ashamed of him silfe. But to be short we will
touch some of his words. The first part of the argument which he ente^deth to
answer to is this: that it should seem convenient that purgatory should be
here on earth because the body which offends with the soul should be purged
with the soul This reason is of no value as I have showed you before. But what
says Rastell^

That reason (says Rastell) proves not on Rastelss (...) lucion
lie that there is no purgatory / but also that there should be neither heaucn
nor hell. for if a man have lived so vertuouslye in earth / that he ought to be
saved and go to the joys of heaven (let us pardon him this lie, for the prophe
te says that no man shall be iustefyed in the sight of god if he enter in to
judgment with Psalm. 14 (...)
us psalm, 143) And yet did never meritorious art but only when the soul
was joined with the body / the^ should he never be rewarded but here in earth
while his soul is joined with the body. Here may ye perceive what Rastell
thin (...).
keth of heaven and hell / even thus that yt body shall never come in heaven
nor hell / which point I will touch more largelye a none. First where Comingo
in his argument says / yt it should seame convenient for purgatory to be
upon earth there says Rastell that he would take away the liberty /
prerogatyue / and auctorite of god. As by example / if I would say / It should
seame conuenye^t that the bysshope of londons palace should be in london /
partiye because it is y^ chefest city of his diocese / and partlye because it
is nigh the court whereto he may the better resor te to get further promocyon
/ there would Rastell say by and by that I took away y^ bissho pes liberty /
prerogative / and auctoryte that he might not set it where he would. belyke
this man has droncke of a merye cup. He aftermeth Rastell (...)
also yt this argument takes away both heaven and hell. why so? Because he
supposes it convenient that purgatory should be here up pon earth? (...) it he
say yt is convenient / yet says he not that it must needs (...). Nay / but
there is a another thing yt Rastels sore yies can not abide. what is that?
verelye for he added y^ it were most conuenyent that the body which is
partetaker in comittinge yt crime / should also be purged and punished with y^
soul. And yt as ye know plucketh Rastell by yt berde / for he went a boute to
prove yt contrary in y^ first chaptre / yt the body has neither pain nor
pleasure. etc^. But how should this take away heaven and hell? for south on
this manner. Rastell thinks not that god can and will join the body again
with yt soul after this tra^sitorye liffe that they may together receive joy
or pain for yt passes his natural philosophy. But thus he ima geneth / when
the body and soul are once depar ted / then say they adieu for ever and
adaye. Therefore (thinks he) if god will punish them in hell together / or
save them together in heaven / then must he take them whiles they are he re
living in earth. And so this supposycyon y^ the body must suffer with the
soul (after Rastels lerninge) must prove that heaven and hell be here in earth
or else there can be none. Se this learned man yt would prove purgatory by^ good
phylosophye^

The second cause / that purgatory should be a good example to the living to
put them in fear to do any like offense / is not soluted of Rastell / but I
have soluted yt before and will yet satysfye you again because Rastell leueth
yt out. we have here in the world / Moses and the prophets that is the old
testament / ye and al so christ and his apostles which we call the new
testament / now if we believe not these / the^ shall we not surely believe
although we had purgatory and hell to among us. And this may well be
gathered of Christ's own words luce. xvi. (...). 16.
where he brought in the parable of the rich man and lazarus / for the rych man
being in pains desired Abraham to send lazarus unto his five brothren to
warn them that they might not come in to that fire: Abraham answered again /
yt they had / Moses and the prophets. And added / let the^ hear the^. The^
said y^ tych man Nay father Abraham / but if any of the^ y^ are de parted
appear unto the^ / the^ will they believe it. And Abraham concludes on this
manner: If they believe not Moses and the prophets / no more will they believe if
any of the deed should rise again. And therefore may I like wise conclude That
if they believe not / neither yet fear the pains which Moses and the prophets
/ ye and christ (...) his apostles have prophesied to fall on y^ unfaithful /
the^ will they not believe for fear of the pains of purgatory.

Now to the last point where purgatory Rastell
should be / he answers as you shall hear. First that it is a folish question
(for he can not answe re unto it by his philosophye) And the he says that no
man can tell / neither the place neither Frith
yet the manner of the pain. Here makes he. S. Thomas ye and all our
scolemen foles by cra ste: partelye because they take upon them to answer
unto this question which he calls fo lysh / and partelye because they fullye
determe that the place of purgatory is the third place in hell / and also
assign fire to be the manner of the pain. And again in this last part he
proves them double foles. Once because they stou telye affirm that thing
which no man can tell (as Rastell says) And again because they re strain
god of his lib ertye that assign any pla ce and make him of less auctorite
then an in ferior judge / which has no place assigned him / but ma^e do
execucion and punish the gytlye in what place he will. I wondre that our
scolemen may abide this fellow.

And then he says that purgatory is in a Rastell
place limitatyue. And where so ever god does limitt the soul to be purged
there is the (...) ue place of that soul and there is the purgato^ of that
soul. So that a man may gather (...) Rastell that the souls be not limited
to one place to be purged and punished. And thereto agrees also his similitude
of y^ judge which assigns one to be punished in one place / and (...) another
in a another place / even at his pleasure. If such gere had come from beyond
the sea it should sone have been condemned although it had not been half so
grevous agenst our scolemen. But let this pass as it is well worthy / (...)
let us se and examine more of this newfangled philosophye.

NOw are we comen unto the sixte argument which begins in the. (...).
chaptre / y^ effect is this

Bepentaunte is the full payment and satisfaccion Rastels si xte argument
of sin and brings remission / therefore as soon as repentance is taken /
god of his justice must give temission / and so there ought to be no purgatory.

This argument is nothing worth / for the Frith.
first part as we have often proved is false For if repentance were y^ full
payment and very sa tisfaccion for sin / then died Christ in vain.
Notwithstondinge if he grant this first part to be true / neither he nor all
his folowes shall be able to solute this argument while they lyve. But because
we will be short / let us pass over to his answer which is in y^. xiii. chap.

In solutinge this argument he groundeth Rastell.
him on two lies atonce / y^ first is y^ god never geveth remission except he
se in us a convenie^t cause countrepaysinge his justice.

What cause found he in y^ man y^ was brought Frith
vnot him sick of y^ palsaye / to whom he said: Mat. (...).
be of good comfort (son) thy sins are forgeven y^? Mat. ix. Mar. ii. Luc.
v. what cause foun de he in the thief that was crucy fyed with him / but y^ he
had been anvnthrifte all his liffe long? And yet even the same day that he
suffered with Christ was he partetaker of joy with him in paradyse Lu. xxiii.
where was purgatory the^ (...). (...)
where was the punishment that he should have suffered for his enormytyes? If
any man should suffer in purgatory / it is like yt this these should have done
it: But he went from deeth to liffe (...) came in purgatory / wherefore I may
(...) y^ no man shall come there / if there were any. What cause I pray you
does Paul assign as touching out rede^pcion and remission of our imne? for
south no another but yt we were m^tched sinners and y^ very enemies of god
(...). v. For says paul / if when we were his enemies we were (...) unto god
through y^ deeth of (...)
his son / much more now we are reco^cyled / shall we be saved by his liffe.
So y^ in us is no manner (...) of remission but only miserye and sins

But the hole cause of y^ remission of our sin (...). 1.
(...) sits on the right hand of y^ father Heb. I. The second lie is this /
he says yt god Rastell
of his justice must give to everye thing his aw ne / which own is the thing
that it deserves to have. If this were true then should not one of (...).
us enter the enheritaunce of heaven / for we have (...). (...).
everye one of us deserved deeth and dampnatyon. For as Paul says Romanorum.
iii. we have (...) sinned and want the glory which before god is allowed. But
we are frelye iustefyed through his grace by the faith that is in thrist Jesus.
If it be frelye through his grace / the^ is it not (...) our own deservinge /
for then grace were no grace. And contrary wise if it be by our own
deservinge / then is it not of grace / for then deserving were no deservinge
Romanorum. Romans 11
xi. But the truth is this / that god of his mercy had promised unto our
forefathers his dear son Christ that he should deliver the^ from all their
iniquityes and that all the nations of the world should be blessed in him Gen
xii. This seed he promised of his mercy and fa Gene. 12
voure / whom also he sent in the time that he Gala. 4
had ordened Galata. 4. not for our own deservinges / but for his truths
sake and to fulfill y^ he had promised. This Christ is become our 1. Cor. 1
right wysnes. 1. Corin. 1. so that yt justice of god is not to give us that we
our selves have deserved (as Rastell lies) but to clothe us with a another
man's justice (that is Christ's) and to give us that which christ has
deserved for us And this justice of god through the faith of Jesus comes unto
all and upon all them that believe Roma. iii. Now mark a (...). Romans 3


Christ humbled him silfe and was made obedient Phil. 2
ii. This obedience and deeth was not for him 2. Cor. (...)
silfe but for us / for he alone suffered and dyed for us all. ii. Corin. v.
Now since he was obedient unto the deeth for us / that is even as good as though
we our selves had been obedient ever rye man for him silfe unto the deeth. And
since he dyed for us / that is even as god as though we had dyed our selves for
our own sins. (...) will thou have more of a man the^ y^ he be obedient
unto god y^ father eve^vnto deeth / ye and dye for his sins / will thou yet
thrust him in to purgatory?

(...) brings hein an answer which is so confused / intricate and long y^
it were not only folishnes to solute it / but also much lost labor and cost
to ^herse it / wherefore I let it pass / for everye child shall easelye solute
it since his ^undacion and first stone is taken from him. But yet one thing is
necessary to be touched. He goes about to prove his purposse with an
ensample on this manner.

If I do beat thy servaunte or apprentisse and (...).
do mayme him / wherbye thou do loose his ser vis^: and also yt this
servaunte duringe his li^e is not able to get his lyvinge. If so be yt thou
do forgive me y^ offense done unto the in that thou have lost his service: yet
am I bound to make a another satisfaccion unto thy servaunt for y^ hurt I have
done him / which is y^ cause of y^ hinderaunce of his lyvinge. And in like ma
ner if I have offended god and my neighbor / ^lbeit god forgive me his deal
/ yet can he not of justice forgive me my neighbors d^ale to / but yet must I
make satisfaccio^ unto my neygh boure. Now in case I would and be not able to
sa tisfye my neighbor / and yet he forgive me not / the^ must I suffer in y^
pains of purgatory for it: and those pains shall stand my neighbor in
profit for part of his purgatory if he come there or cls to y^ increase of
his joy if he go to heaven. This is the sum / but he speaks it in many
moo words. Now because he has touched y^ matter of satisfa^ion I will show
you my mind therein. ^rith.


There are two manner of satisfaccions. The Satisfac^o^ to god
one is to god: the the other to my neighbor. To god can not all y^ world make
satisfaccion for one crime. In so much yt if everye grass of the ground were
a man / even as holy as ever was Paul or Peter and should pray unto god al
their lyves long for one crime / yet could they not make satisfaccio^ for it.
But it is only y^ blood of Christ yt has made full satisfaccio^ unto god for
all such crimes Hebre. vij. or cls were there no remedy but we should all
perysh: as I have proved before. And he yt seeks any other satisfaccio^
Hebreo. (...)
toward god then Christ our savioure / he does wrong unto his precious
blood.

There is a another satisfaccion which is unto Satisfa^cion to my neyghbou re
my neighbor whom I have offend^d. As if I have taken any man's god from
him. For then am I bound to pacefye him other by restoringe it again or else
by other means as we two ca^ agree. If I have diffamed him / then am I bound
to pacefie him / and to restore him unto his good fame again / and so forth.
But if I be not able to satisfye him / then must I knowledge my silfe gyl tie
and desire him to forgive me / and then is he boun de to forgive me / or else
shall he never enter in to heaven. For god has taught us to pray. Mat. vj. yt
he should forgive us / as we forgive them Mat. 6.
y^ trespace agenst us / so yt if we forgive not one a another then will not god
forgive us. To this Mat. 18
well agrees the parable Mat. xviij. The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
certain king which would take accomptes of his servauntes And when he had
begun to reken one was brought unto him / which ought him ten thousand
talentes: but when he had naught to pay y^ lord commanded him to be sold /
and his wyffe and his children / and all yt he had / and payment to be made.
The servaunte fell down and besought him sa yenge: Sir give me respite / and I
will pay it eve rye whitte. Then had y^ lord pytye on the servaunte and
lowsed him and forgave him the debte. The same servaunte went out and found
one of his fellows / which ought him an. C. pence. And laid hondes on him and
took him by y^ throat / saye^ge pay yt thou owe. And his fellow fell dou ne
and besought him saying: have patience with me and I will pay y^ all: and he
would not / but went and cast him in to preson till he should pay y^ debte.
Uvhe^ his other fellows saw what was done they were very sorye and came and
told unto their lord all yt had happened. Then ye lord call led him and
said unto him. O evell servaunte / I forgave y^ all yt debte / because thou
praydest me: was it not mete also yt thou should have had compassion on thy
fellow / even as I had pitye on the? And his lord was wroth and delivered him
to the gaolers / till he should pay all yt was due to him. So like wise shall
your hevenlye father do unto you if you will not forgive with your hartes^ech
one to his brother their trespaces. Here may thou se yt if you forgive ha^
rely y^ small debte or offense y^ thy neighbor has done against the / the^
will thy hevenlye father forgive the / the hole and great debte yt thou owe
him / for y^ which thou art well worthy to be damned. And so is it more
profitable for y^ to forgive it than yt thy neighbor should broy le in
purgatory for it / as Rastell fayneth. And contrary wise if thou forgive him
not / the^ shall not god forgive the thy great debte / but thou shall surely
be dampened / and so shall not thy neygh boures purgatory profit y^ (be it in
case there were one and yt he should go thither) but it is ra there the cause of
thy dampnacion: but this can not Rastell se.

NOw be we come unto the seventh reason Rastels se ve^th argu meant
which is in y^. xiiij. chap. The argument is this. God is y^ very owner of
all / and thy neighbor has no properte / but as a servaunte to god / as but
to make account to god. Thefore when thou do an offense to god and to thy
neygh boure / when god forgeveth it thou nedest no another satisfaccio^ unto thy
neighbor And to sta blish his reason he brings in a similitude which is
nothing to y^ purpose. The similitude is this I put case thou have a servaunte
who^ thou put test in trust to occupy for y^ / to make bargaynes change and
sell to thy use / to take bonds and agay ne to make aquitaunces and releses i
his own name. If this servaunte sell part of thy ware and ta ke an obligacion
for y^ payment of. xx. pound / if thou afterward knowinge of this / either
for lo ve or some other cause w^lt make unto ye said debtoure a clear relese:
I suppose no man will de nigh but yt this debtoure is fullye discharged of this.
xx. pound / and is not bound by any justice to make any satiffaccion either
unto thy servaunte or to any other man. For thou art y^ ve^ye owner thereof /
and thy servaunte had but y^ occupacyon as to give the accoumptes thereof.

This similitude ca^ not well be applied unto Frith.
god and man. For albe it is true y^ all our substaun Agge^. ^.
ce pertains unto god at it is written Agg. ij. gol de is mine and silver is
mine: yet has not god geven it us to occupy it for his profit and use (as y^
servaunte does for his master) but only y^ we should use his gifts for y^
profit of our neygh boure and to the use of y^ co^gregacio^. 1. Co. 12. And
2. Co^. 12
where as he induces yt when god forgeveth us which is the principalle part /
yt thou nedest no another satisfaccio^ to thy neighbor. I answer / y^ god
forgeveth no man which has offended his neighbor / vulesse y^ he make
satisfaccion unto his neigboure / if he be able but if he be not able / yet is
he bound to knowledge his fault un to his neighbor / and the^ is his
neighbor bou^ de vnd y^ pain of da^pnacio^ to forgive him / so yt god (...)
forgeveth until thy neighbor be pacefyed in case y^ crime exte^de unto thy
neygh boure This soluteth both y^ reason and also impro veth y^ similitude. Now
let us declare his solucion Rastell. (...) so (...).


God of him silfe has two powers: One is an absolute power / and a another is
an ordinarye power. The absolute power is the auctorite y^ god has over all
thing in y^ world, by y^ he ma ye give to everye creature what pleases him /
and also forgive everye offense done by any creature at his pleasure with out
any cause. And by this may he forgive both y^ crime done towar des him silfe /
and also toward my neighbor. But by his ordinarye power he does every
thing by order of justice and equite. And by this can he not forgive the
offense done to him and my neighbor with out satisfaccion.

Now would I feign wete / whether Rastell (...).
imagine y^ god by his absolute power may save Gods
y^ unfaithful and da^pne the faithful If he say absolute power.
Nay / the^ may I conclude y^ Rastels diffinicyo^ is false where he says:
yt god by his absolute power may give to everye creature what pleases him /
and also forgive everye offense done by any creature at his pleasure with out
any cause. If he say ye / the^ must I conclude yt god has power to do
contrary to his scripture / for y^ scripture says: y^ he that beleveth and
is baptized shall be saved / but he y^ beleveth not shall be condemned (...). 16.
Mar. xvj. Now if he grant me y^ he has power to do agenst his scripture
(since his scripture is y^ truth and his own word / the^ must it needs follow
yt he has power to do against his truth: and consequentlye he has power to be
fal^ / and so to sin. And since he has power agenst his own word / and yt
word his son / the^ must we grant him power agenst his son / and ven to
make him a liar where he said y^ forsayed textes Marci. xvj. And since his
son is god / then has god power to do agenst god and Mat. 12.
so can not his kingdom endure. Matthei. xij.

Furthermore / if I might be bold with Ra stell / I would ask him this
question / whether god have not an absolute justice as well as an abso lute
power? If god have also an absolute justice / then whete^
can not his absolute power prevayle un till his absolute justice be fully
countrepaysed. god have an absolu te iustice^
And so is it false yt Rastell begins with all / yt god by his absolute
power may forgive eve rye offense at his pleasure with out any cause. For (as
I said) his absolute justice must needs be satisfied and fullye countrepaysed.
If Rastell dare say that god has an absolute power and no absolute justice /
then takes he his pleasure in deed. For if he make one nocionall in god
greater the^ a another (by this word nocionall which y^ scoleme^ use / I would
you should understand: y^ goodness / wysedo^ / power / justice and mercy of god
and (...).) then shall he make a dissencyo^ in god and imagyne yt one nocionall
subdueth a another. ye and besides y^ / since each one of these nocionalles is ve
rye god (for y^ power of god is nothing but god him silfe / and y^ justice of
god is nothing but god him silfe / and so forth of all the other) the^ if his
po were were greater then his justice / it should follow y^ god were greater the^
god / and conseque^tlye we should have a great god and a little god and mo
gods the^ one / such revell makes Rastel with his turcke. But y^ christian
believe yt one power of god is no greater the^ a another and yt his power is not
above his justice / neither his justice above his mercy etc^. And so may you
se that Rastels imaginacion of gods absolute power is but very childish and
vnsaverye. For he has no power agenst his scripture and him silfe. Thus (...)
his seven reasons with their solucions

But yet that his work should long endure all tempests and storms / he
adds a batelme^t ^d wether stone to avoyde and shote off the ray ne / for
tear it should so^e in and make his buyl dynge decay. And therewith concludes
his book

To believe / says he / that there were no purgatory (...)
to purge and punish our sins after we be departed / should put avaye yt
dread of god from the most part of y^ people and give them boldness to commit
offenses and sins. And agay ne / if the people should believe yt they never
neade to make any satisfaction nor restitucio^ to their neighbors for the
wrongs done unto them / they should never force nor care what (...) / (...) /
theftes / robberies and murders they did. Finallye if they believed that such a
light repentance should be sufficient with out any other satisfaccion to be
made / it should be an occasion to destroy all virtue and increase vice and
sin to y^ utter destruccio^ of the commonwealth and quiet lyuinge of y^
people. And thus he makes an (...)

As to the first where he says that it would (...)
put away the dread of god and give boldness to sin / if we thought there
were no purgatory / we se and may evidentlye perceive the con trarye all day
both in young and old of them that believe there is a purgatory. The yo^ge sa
ye I will take my pleasure while I may. and if I may have but one hou^es
respite to cry god mercy / I care not. for then shall I go but to purgatory
and so shall I be sure to be saved. The old say: I will keep my goods as
long as I may for I wotte not what nead I shall have. But when I die I will
cry god mercy / and then shall I go but to purgatory / and mine executours
that have my goods shall redeem me thence well enough. And so to believe
purgatory / is rather an occasion of rechlesse boldenesse^ then of the fear
of god. Besides that if they knews that there were no purgatory / the^ (...)
de many the more fear god and do well them selves and not trust to their
executoures for fear of da^pnacio^ / how be it as I have said before they y^
fear not god but for pain whether it be of hell or purgatory are yet under
conde^pnacion and not in gods favor. And this dare I bold lie afferme /
that they which fear not god but for purgatoryes sake shall never come in it /
no nor yet in heaven. And therefore it is but folly to imagine purgatory for
that intent.

As co^cerninge y^ second point. If the people (...)
believed yt they neded not to make satisfaccio^ to their neighbors for their
trespaces etc^ I have sufficie^tlye a^swered before / y^ we must make
satisfaccio^ unto our neighbors if we be able or else will god never forgive
us. And if we be not able / yet must we knowledge our offense and the^ is our
neighbor bound to forgive us under y^ pain of da^pnacio^. And so can this
pro ue no purgatory Now as touching y^ their de / yt if they believed y^ such a
light repentance were sufficient with out any other satisfaccio^ / it should be
an occasion of vice and subuersio^ of y^ come^ wealth: I answer / as I have
done before al most in every argument: since thou art ignoraunte of Christ's
deeth and his satisfaccion unto the father for us / that all the repentance
which we can take is not sufficient to countrepayse one crime / but that if
Christ were not we should albe dampened. Here will I leave Rastell and his turcke
Gingemin with all thyce natural phylosophye (which is now proved folishnes)
for hitherto has he proved no purgatory / neither has he one good reason nor
yet to that varen reasons one good solucyon / as we have sufficie^tlye
declared. But let us hear (...) what more of gods word: and se how
purgatory stondeth with that.

Paul says / we must all be brought before (...). Cor. 5.
which shall profit him after he is dyssolued from his body / for then should
he not receive according to the works of his body. But rather according to
the pains that he suffered in purgatory. Now if this text be true then must
it follow that all thine executoures dealin ge / and offeringe of massepence.
etc. help the not a myte. And by this text it is not possible that there
should be a purgatory.

Upon this text would I feign dyspute a point of sophystrye / which I would
gladlye have dyssolued of them that think them selves learned in phylosophye.
My sophisme is / y^ two contradictoryes may stand to gether and be Contrady
(...)
both true. which I am sure no sophystre dare grant / for it has in times
past ben condemp ned in oxforde foran^eresie. The co^tradictories are these.
Every man shall receive according to the works of his body. And some man
shall not receive according to the works of his bo dye / that these two
co^tradictoryes be both true I will prove. The first proposycyon is paul's 2.
Cor. 5. which no man will deny to be true. And the second may caselye be
proved true / which is / that some man shall not receive according to the
works of his body. For be y^ in case y^ there depart a man out of this worl
de which is not clean purged by faith and y^ worcester de of god neither has his
rebellyous me^bres subdued through deeth (as they imagyne) but y^ the spots
and remnauntes of sin remain in him for the which he is worthy to lie in y^
pains of purgatory for the space of six year This granted / which I am
sure they will not deny / then also put I the case that this man lyinge in
purgatory by the space of a month / have a friend which offers for him a
penny unto. S. dominikes box (which has such power that as soon as the tinginge
is hard in the box so sone the soul is fre in heaven) or that a friend of
his bye a pardon for him which may absolve him a pena and a culpa for all
comes to one effect. This man delivered on that manner does not receive
according to the works of his bo dye for by the works of his body he should
yet lie in purgatory more then. v. year? And that does he not / but is by and
by delivered from purgatory. Ergo I may conclude that some man receaueth not
according to the works of his body / and so are two contradictoryes true or
else there can be no such deliuerau^ce out of purgatory / which destroys all
pardons / massepence and suffragyes for the deed. This would I have soluted.
How be it I will not adnumbre it for an argument because the unlearned peo ple
(unto who^ I write this book) can not well perceive it. But this sophisme have
I written to stop the chatteringe mouths of the sophi sters and to cast them
a bone to gnawe upon.

Paul says / you which were in times pa him for us all / how shall he not
with him give us all things also? who shall lay any To.
thing to y^ charge of gods chosen? To, 8. Forsouth lord god our prelates
lay so sore unto their charge / that they would have them broyle in

that we must be purged a fresh by the fire of purgatory? I pray god give us
grace that we may be purged from this our blind ignorance through his sprete
of knowledge / that we may perceave how yt is Jesus Christ that purges our
sins and has delivered us through his bloudeshedynge. So should we give him
y^ praise which has deserved yt. And not be so unkind unto him as we now be.

^o this well agrees paul. Ephesians. 2. saying / by grace are ye made saffe

should bost him self. Loo here says paul plainly that our salvation is
the gift of god (...) comes not of works / if it come not of worcester kes then
are we worse then mad to feign a put gatorye. For the chefest operacyon of that
should be but to supplye the works which we have not accomplyshed being in
this bodye^

Paul says. Roma. xi. The remnaunte (...). II.
which are left at this time / are through the eleccyon of grace. If yt be
through grace then is yt not by works / for the^ grace were no gra ce. Or if yt
be for the works sake / so is yt not of favors and grace / according to that
which (...). 4.
he wrote before. Roma. 4. If abraham (says paul) were iustylyed by his
works / then may he rejoice but not before god. But what says the
scripture: Abraham belcued god and that was unputed unto him for rightwysnes /
for he that works reccaueth his reward not of savoure but of duty. Now if
it be duty / then ne death he not to thank god / but rather him self for then
god gives him nothing but yt which is his own of duty. Where is then the
praise and glory that we owe to god? Therefore yt follows in y^ same text:
unto him yt works not / but believes in him that iustefieth the wy ked / is
his faith imputed ^or ryghtwysenes. Now if our salvation come of faith and not
through our works and deserts / the is purgato rye shut out of door and
quite vanishes awaye^

Christ says. So has god loved the world (...). 3.
that he would give his only son that all which beieue in him should not
perish: but that they should have everlastinge liffe. Joan. 3. The^ what needs
purgatori^ Thou will paraduen turesay / it is true they shall have euerlastige
life but they must first go through purgatory. I an swear / nay verelye. But
christ affirms and that with an oath / that he which hears his word and
beleveth his father which sent him / has everlastinge liffe. ye and that he
is gone already from deeth unto liffe. Joan. 5. will thou now say yt he shall
in to purgatory? for south if that were true / and the fire also so hot as

unto a greater deeth.

The prophet says: precious is in the sight Psalm. 116.
And. S. Joan. says / blessed are the deed which Apoca. 14
dye in the lord. Apo. 14. but surely if they should go in to y^ paynfull
purgatory / there to be tour mented of fendes / the^ were they not blissed /
but rather wretched.

God says by Moses Exodi. 33. I will show Edodi. 33.
ue compassion on whom I have compassion. Now ifoure salvation be of mercy and
compassion then can there be no soch purgatory. For y^ na ture of mercy is to
forgive / but purgatory will have all paid and satis^yed so that they tway ne
be desperate and can in no wise agree. And lo ke how many textes in scripture
comme^d gods mercy / even so many deny this paynfull purgatory.

The prophet says / he has not dealt with Psalm. 103.
hye has he made his mercy to prevail over them that worshuppe him. And look
how far the east is from the west / even so far has he set our sins
from us. Psalm. 103. And before (...) the same psalm / the prophet exhorts
his soul to praise the lord / saying. Praise the lord (o my soul) which
forgeueth y^ all thine iniquityes and heals all thy dyseas es. Now if this be
true yt he ordoreth us not according to our sins / but pours his mercy
so plentu ^uslic upon us / if also he forgive us all our in^ quityes / why
should there be any such purgatory to purge and tourment the sely souls / and
speeyallye since all was forgeuen them before?

will thou not call him a shrewed creditou ^e which after he has frelye
forgeuen his de^ toure / will yet cast him in preson for the same debte? I
think every man would say on this manner / It was in his own pleasure whether
he would forgive it or not / and then of favor and compassyon he forgave it.
But now he has forgeuen yt he does vnryghtwyslye to punysh his debtoure for
yt. And all be yt man repent his forgeuynge and afterward sue for his debte /
yet god can never repent him self (...).
of his mercyable gifts. Roma. xi. And therefore will he u^uer tourment us for

be for which men feign that we must be tourmen ted in purgatory. For there is
no soul (as they grant them selves) that suffers in purgatory for great
crimes and mortal syn nes. But only for little preatye peccadu tyans (if a man
may be boolde to use Master Mores word) and for venial sins. Dis. 25. Cap.

greater unto Marye Mawdelene. Luce. vij. Is his hand now shortened? Is not
his power as great as it was? Is he not as merciful as ever he was? why leave
we the cisterne of lyvinge water / and dig us pittes of our a wne which can
hold no pure water? Hieremie. ii. why forsa ke we Christ which has hoellye
purged us an seek a another purgatory of our own imaginacion? If thou believe
that Christ's blood is sufficient to purge thy sin / why sekest thou a
another purgatory?

S. Paul says: I desire to be loosed from Phil. ^.
if he had thought to have gone through purgatory he would not have been so
hastye. For there should he have had an hot broth and an heart less / and so
might he rather have desired long to have lyved. And therefore I suppose that
he knew nothing of purgatory but yt he rather thought (as the truth is) yt
deeth should finish all his evylles and sorrows and give him rest in loosinge
him from his rebellious me^bres which were sold and capty ve under sin.

All christen men should desire deeth as Pau ^ow a christ man should desire
deeth
(...) does Phililp. 1. not because of their cross and trouble which they
suffer in this present world for then they sought them selves and their own
profit and not the glory of god. But if we will well desire deeth / we must
first consider how sore sin displeases god our father / and then our own
nature and frayltye and our members so bound under sin that we can not do
2. Cor. 3.
nor yet think a good thought of our selves. 2. Cor. 3. Then shall we find
occasion to lament our liffe / not for the troubles that we suffer in it / but
because we be so prone unto sin and so continuallye displease god our
father. Uvhat desires he that would long lyve / but daily to hepe sin
upon sin? And therefore should we have a will to dye because that in deeth
our sin ne (...) / and then we shall no more displease god our father. Now if
we should feign a purgatory / it were not possible to imagyne a greater
obstacle to make us fear and fly from (...). For since everye man must
knowledge him silfe a (...). 1. Joan. 1. And not believe that chri stes death
were sufficient / but that he must also 1. Jo. 1.
go to purgatory: who should depart this world with a quiet mind?

The wiseman says: The souls of y^ right (...). 3
grant me that everye faithful is right wi (...). ^.
se in y^ sight of god as it is written Abacuc. ij. y^ Romans 5
right wiseman lyveth by his faith. And Romans v. because we are justified by
faith / we are at peace with god through our lord Jesus Christ. etc^. when
these faithful or rightwyse depart / then says this text that they are
fools which thin ke them to be in pain or affliccion: for it affermeth that
they are in peace. Now since their pu^ gatorye which they imagyne is pain and
afflic cion / and yet feign that the rightwyse only shall enter in to it after
their deeth / the^ are they foles that suppose there is a purgatory / or el^
^his text can not be true.

Hor what intent will god have us tourmen ted in purgatory / to make
satisfaccion for our Romans 10
preachers thither / ergo their faith can not there be increased. And again /
pain engenders and kendleth ^ate agenst god and not love or charity.
Furthermore. My lord of Rochestre is compelled to grant that the souls in
purgatory (...)
obtain there neither more faith nor grace More and mi lord of Rochestr^ can
not ^gre
nor cherite then they brought in with them / and so can I se no reasonable
cause why there should be a purgatory. Never thelesse Master More says / that
both their grace and cherite is increased. And so may you perceave that lies
can never agree how wittye so ever they be that feign and cloak them For in some
points they shall be found contrary so that at the length they may be
disclosed.

God is fullye pacefyed with thy will when Pro. 23
fact. For the wiseman says proverb. xxiij. son give me thy heart. Now if
thy will be upright and so y^ thou have a desire to fulfill the law / then
does god reken y^ will unto the for y^ full fact. If then through the frayltye
of thy me^ bres thou fall in to sin / thou may well say with the apostle
Romanoru^. vij. The good yt I would do / that do I not: yt is / I have a will
and Romans 7
desire to fulfill the law of god / and not to displease my hevenlye father /
yet that I do not. But the evyll which I hate / that do I / that is I do
commit sin which in dead I hate. Now if I hate the sin which I do / then
love I the law of god which forbids sin / and do consent unto this law
that it is good right wise and holy. And so the sin which I hate and yet co^
mitte it through the frayltye of my members / is not iputed nor rekened unto me
for sin. Ney there will S. Paul grant that it is I which do that sin /
but he said: I have a will to do good / but I can not perform that will. For
I do not that good which I would / but the evyll which I would not that do I.
Now if I do yt thing which I would not do / then is it not I yt do it but the
sin that dwells with in me. I delight in the law of god with mine inward
man (that is with my will and mind which is renewed with the sprete of god) but
I se a another law in my members which rebelleth against the law of my mind
and makes me bond un to the law of sin which is in my members. So yt I my
silfe in my will and mind do obey the law of god (hatinge sin as the law
commands me and not consentinge unto it in my mind and will) but in my
^iesh and members I serve the law of sin / for the fraylt^e of my members
compels me to sin Romans 7.

As by example if I se a poor man which is not of abilite to do me any
pleasure / and nevertheless does all his diligence to seek my favor and
would with har^e and mind give me some acceptable present if he were of power
being also sorye that he can not perform his will and mind toward me. Now
if there be any point of humanite or gentleness in me / I will count this
man for my frinde / and accept his good will as well / as though he had in de
ad performed his will. For his abilite extends no further. If his power were
better / better should I have. Even so since we are not of power and abilite to
perform the law of god / and yet bear a good heart toward god and his law
/ lamentinge our imbecillitye that we can do him no further pleasure: the^
will god recoun te us not as his enemies / but as his dear children and
beloved friends. Neither will he after ward thrust us in to purgatory / but
as a tender father pardone us our trespaces / and accep te our good will for
the full deed.

S. Paul exhorts us Gal. vj. that we worcester Gala. 6.
man does so we that shall h^ repe / by this may we evidentlye preceave that
he shall not (...) according to his doing or suffringe in a another world /
and therefore ca^ there be no purgatory. The wyseman says Eccle. xiiij. work
rightu Eccle. 14.
There are some which will understand this place and also the text in the.
xlviij. argument on this manner that there should be no place of deservinge /
but yet there may well a be a place of punishment. But this solucion besides
that it is not ground^d on scripture / is ver^e (...). For I pray you wherefore
should their inve^ (...) of purgatory serve but to be a place of pur ginge /
punishment / and penance / by the which the soul should make satisfaccion /
that it might so deserve to enter in to the rest of heaven?

Blessed are the deed which dye in the lord from hence forward / ye truly
says the sprete / that they may rest from their labors. But their works
follow with the^. This text they use in their soulemasses as though it made
for (...). 14
purgatory. But surely me thinks that it ma keth much against them. For let
us inquire of all the (...) and fautours of purgatory / wh^ there the souls
that must be prayed for / are departed in the lord or not? And they must needs
answer that thy are departed in the lord / for the unfaithful which dye not
in the lord must not be prayed for. And therefore must they be upright Christen
souls which are toutmented / for the other are all dampened. Now says ye tex
te that all such deed as dye in the lord are blessed: but what blessedness
were that to broyle in purgatory? And if they would here feign a gloss (as
their manner is when they are in a strayte ever to seek a starttinge hole) and
say that they are blessed because they are in a good hope / although they have
not yet the rest / but must suf^er before in purgatory: that evasion will not
^his text suffer / for the text says yt they rest and are in peace as
Esaias also says in ye. (...) Esa. 57
that the rightwyse (and everye faithful man is rightwyse in the sight of god
as we have often proved before) when he departs rests in peace Sapi. 3.
as in a bed. And sapiencie. iij. it is said yt the rightwyse souls are in
peace: And so is it not possible that there should be such a paynefull
purgatory.

Thus have we confuted Rastell: both his ar gumentes and also solucions / for
all that he wri teth is false and agenst scripture. Furthermore / we have
brought in to prove that there can be no such purgatory. l. arguments all
grounded on scripture. And if neade were a man might ma ke a thousand of which
our cleregie should not be able to avoyde on?

Here I think some men will wondre that I have the scripture so full on my
side because that there are certain men / as my lord of Rochestre and Sir
Thomas More / which by scripture go about to prove purgatory: and this is
sure that scripture is not contrary unto it silfe. Therefore it is necessary
that we examine the textes which they bring in for their purpos se / markinge
ye process both what goes before and whate comes after. And the^ shall we
easelye perceave the truth / and how these two me^ have been pituouslye
deceaved. First I will answer unto Master More which has in a manner nothing
but that h^ took out of my lord of Rochestre / although he handle it more
suttellye. And what so ever is not answered in this part / shall be touched and
fullye convinced in the third / which shall be a several book agenst my lord
of Rochestre.

Thus ends the first book.
The second book which is an answer unto Sir Thomas More.
MAster More begineth with the M. More
selye souls of purgatory and makes them to wayle and lament / that they
hear the wor^ de wax so faynte in the faith of christ that any man should ne
ade now to prove purgatory to christian men / or that any man could be found
which would in so great a thin ge so fullye and fastlye believed for an undoubted
article this. xv. hundred year / begin now to staggar and stand in doubt
and (...).

^erelye me thinks it a foul fault so sore (...)
to stomble eve^ at the first. It were agreate blot t^ for him / if he should be
compelled by good auctorite to cut of. iiij. hundred of his forsayed number
Now if we can not only prove that he must cut off that. iiij. hundred year
/ but also bring witness that it was neither at that time believed for an
article of the faith nor yet for an undoubted truth: then I think ye would sup
pose this man sum whate out of the way. And that will I prove by gods grace.
S. Augustyne was. iiij. hundred year after Christ. And yet in his time was it
not fullye and fastlie beleved for an article of the faith / no nor yet fullye
and fastly beleved to be true For he him self writes in his enchiridion on
this manner speakinge of purgatory: After he expounded y^ place of Pau le. 1.
Corin. 3. and had taken this word fire not (...). Cori. 3.
for purgatory / but for temptacion and tribula cio^ / he added these words
in y^. 69. chaptre. It is not incredible that such a thing should also chance
after this liffe / and whether it be so or not it may be questioned (...). Of
these worcester des may we well perceive that he counted it not for an article of
the faith neither yet for an undoubted truth for if it had been an article of
the faith / or an undoubted truth: then would he not have said / potest etiam
queri / that is to sa ye it may be questioned / doubted or moved: for those
holy fathers used not to make questions and doubts in articles of the faith
among the^ selves / neither yet in soch things as were undoubted true. They
used not to dispute whether Christ dyed for our sins and rose again Roma. 4.
for our iustificacion / but only believed it.

Be sides that the occasion why he wrote y^ book entitled enchiridto^ was this.
There was one Laurencius a christen man which instantlye required of. Sain.
Austayne that he would write him a form of his belefe which he might
continuallye vere in his hand and where un to he should stick. Upon this
wrote him. S. Austy ne this little book / where in he commands him not fullye
and fastlye to believe (these are Master Mores words) that there was a
purgatory: buth said that it may be questioned / doub ted or moved whether
there be soch a place or not. Of this have we plain evidence yt it was none
article of the faith in. S. Austaynes time (which was. iiij. hundred year
after Christ) ney there yet undoubted truth. And so may all men se that master
More is sore deceaved and set on the sonde even at the first brunte and in
the beginning of his viage.

His second reason that he has to prove M. more
purgatory is this: The very miscreauntes and idolatres / Turks / Saracenes
and paynims ha ue ever for the most part thought and believed that after the
bodies are deceased: the souls of such as were neither deedlye dampened
wretches for ever / nor on the the other side / so good (...) that their offenses
done in this world have deserved more punishment then they had suffered and
sustained there / were purged and punished by pain aster the deeth / ere ever
they were admit^ed unto their wealth and rest. And so must there needs be a
purgatory.

I answer / if it were lawful to require wy Frith.
sedom in a man so wise as Master More is counted / here would I wysh him a
little more wit. for I think there is no wyseman that will gra unte this to
be a good argument / the Turks / Saracenes / paynims and Jews believe it to be
tr ue / ergo we must believe that it is true: for I will show you a like
argument. The Turks / Sara cenes / paynims and Jews believe that we have not
the right Christ / but that we are all dampened which believe in Christ. Is it
therefore true? shall we turn our faith because they believe yt we be deceaved?
I think there is no man so fo lish as to grant him this. But if Master Mo re
will have his reason hold / he must argue on this man^r: The (...) and
infidels before named believe that there is a purgatory and their believe is
true / therefore we must believe yt there is a purgatory. Now soloweth this argu
meant sum what more formallye. Here might I put him to the proof of his minor /
which is / that their belefe (in beleuinge purgatory) is true: which thing he
shall never be able to prove. But I have such confidence of the truth on my
side (...) I will take upon me to prove the negatyue / Even that their belefe
is not true as (...) purgatory. for these miscreauntes which (...) purgatory
(believe not yt there is a purgatory for us that be Christen: for they believe
that we are fallen from al truth and ^tterlye (...). But they think that there
is a purgatory for the^ selves wherein they shall be purged and punished until
they have made full satisfaccio^ for their sins committed: but that is false
/ for neither Turks / Saracenes paynims nor Jew is which believe not in Christ
have or ever shall enter in to any purgatory / but they are all da^p ned
wretches because they bel^ue not in ^esu Christ. Joan. 3 Now since they be
deceaved / for Joan. 3.
they have no purgatory / but are al dampened as many as believe not / Alas what
blindness is that to argue that we must solowe them which are both blind and
out of the right way?

After this disputes he by natural reason y^ there must be a purgatory, his
disputacio^ continues a leffe and an half / out of the which Ra (...) took
all his book And so are all his appare^t reasons disclosed before agenst
Rastell. The^ begins he with the scripture / on this manner

IT seems very probable and likelye that y^ M. More
good king Ezechias for no another cause Ezechias
wept at the warninge of his deeth geven him by the prophet / but only for
the fear of purgatory. etc^.

The storye is written. 4. Reg. 2. And. Esai. 38 Ezechias was sike unto y^
deeth. And Esai the prophet and son of Amos came unto him saye^ge / this
says y^ lord / dispose thy house for thou Frith.
shall dye / and not ly ve. he turned his face unto 4. Regu^. 2
the wall and prayed the lord saying / I beseech Esaye. (...).
the lord / remember I pray the / how I have walked before the in the truth
and in a perfeyte heart / and have done that thing which is pleasant and
acceptable before the.

Then Ezechias wept with great cryenge. these are the words of the text. we
can not pe^ ceaue by the text that he was a great sinner / but rather the
contrary. for he says that he has walked before the lord in truth and in a
perfeyte heart / and has done yt thing which is pleasant and acceptable
before the lord. And therefore it is nothing like that he should fear
purgatory neither yet hell. Thou will A question to Master More
paradventure ask me / if he wept not for fear of purgatory / why did he
then weep? I will also ask you a question / and then will I show you my
mind. Christ did not only weep / but feared so sore yt he swette like drops
of blood (...) down upon the earth / which was more then to weep. Now if I
should ask you why Christ feared and swette so sore: what wol de you answer
me? that it was for fear of the pains of purgatory? forsouth he that would
so answer should be laughed to skorne of all y^ world / as he were well
worthy. wherefore was it the^? verelye even for fear of deeth / as it play
nlye appears after: for he prayed unto his father Math. 26
saying: my father if it be possible let this deeth ^asie fro me. Mat. 26. so
fearful a thing is deeth even unto the most purest flesh. And even the same
cause will I assign in Ezechias that he wept for fear of deeth / and not for
pur gatorye. Now proceadeth he further and promises to prove it by plain
evident textes / as it is very needful. for the text that he alleged before
is sum what to far wrested and yet will it not serve him

Have ye not (says he) the words of scripture M. More
written in the book of the kings / dominus deducit ad inferos er reducit: Our
lord brings folk down in to^hell / and brings them thence again? But
they that be in that where the dampened souls be / they be never delivered
thence again. wherefore yt apparesh well that they whom god delivers and
brings thence again / be in that part of hell that is called purgatory.

^hys text is written in the first book of y^ Frith
kings and in the ii. chaptre / and they are the 1. Re. 2.
words of Anna which says: The lord does kylle and quicken again: he
ledeth down in to hell and brings again. Here he thinks to have good
hold. But surely his hold will fay le him / for in this one text he shows
him self twyse ignorau^te. First because he knows not that the hebrew word
/ sheol / does not signyfye hell / but a grave or pit that is dug. As it
is written geneses. 42. Si quid aduersitatis acci Gene. 42.
derit ei in terra ad qua^ pergitis / deducetis canos meos cu^ dolor ad iferos
/ yt is / If any evil chau^ ce unto my son benjamin in y^ land whether you
go / you shall bring down min hoore hea^es with sorrow unto my grave / not
unto hell nor yet unto purgatory / for he thought neither to go to hell nor
purgatory for his son / but thought yt he should dye for sorrow if his son
had any myschaunce.

Besides yt he is clean ignorau^te of y^ come^ manner of all prophets which for
y^ most part in all psalms / himnes and other songs of praise (as this is)
make y^ first end of the verse to ex pound y^ last and the last to expou^de
the first. He that observes this rule shall understonde very much in y^
scripture although he be ignorau^te in the hebrew. So does this place full well
expoun de it self with out any imaginacion of pugato (...). Confer the first
part of y^ verse unto the last and you shall easelye perceive it. The first
part of the half verse is this. The lord does uylle / and that expounds
the the other half of this verse where she says / he leads down to hell / so
that in this place to kille and to lead down to hell is all one thing. And
likewise in the second part of the half verse / to quyc^en again and bring
agayneis all one thing. Now yt any man be so supersticious yt he dare not
understand this thing as fyguratelie spo (...) / then may he verefye yt
upon them yt god raised from natural deeth as he did lazatum Io. 11.
Joan. xi. And albe yt no man can deny but yt this sense is good and yt the
text may so be un derstonde / yet in my mind we shall go more nigh unto the
very and pure truth / if we expound yt thus. The lord does kill and quycken
again / he leads down to hell and brings again: that is / he brings
men in to extreme afflyccyon and miserye (which is sygnyfyed by deeth and hell)
and after tourneth his face unto them and makes them to follow him. And to
this well agrees the. 78. psame yt speaks of y^ (...). 78.
children of Israel (which figure his elect church and congregation) Their
years passed over in perpetual trouble / when he distroyed (...) killed the^
/ then they sought him / they turned and besought him beselye. He means not
here that he had f^rst killed them by temporal deeth and after their deeth
made them to seek him: but that he had wropped them in extreme afflic cions and
perpetual troubles / and that he sore scourged them when they brake his
commandments and yet after turned his merciful face unto them.

(...) / if you will have y^ pure vndersto^ ^inge of this place / note y^
words of y^. 3. children dani. 3. which were cast in to the furnace of fire
Dani. 1.
and yet preserved from deeth through y^ mighty ha^ de of god / their words
and song was this: Benedicite anania / azaria / misael domino / laudate et
superexaltate eu^ in secula: quia eruit nos de inferno / and saluos fecit de
manu mortis / and libera uit nos de medio arde^tis fla^me / et de medio ignis
eruit nos. That is: bliss ye anania / azaria / and misael the lord: praise
and avaunce him for ever. For he has plucked us out of hell / and has saved
us tro^ y^ power of deeth. He has deliue red us from the mids of the
burninge flame / and has plucked us out from the mids of the fie re. Here
may you se the same manner of speakin ge and how the last end expounds the
begin ninge. These children say that god has plucked them out of hell / and
yet were they neither dampened nor in purgatory nor deed. But the next part
of this verse expounds their meaning which says he has saved us from the
hand or power of deeth. So may ye know that to be plucked out of hell / and to
be saved from y^ power of deeth / are al one thing. And again where they
say that god has delyvered the^ from ye burninge flame / and that he has
plucked the^ from yt mids of y^ fire / is all one sense as every child may
well perceive: and therefore is M. More to blame to be so busy saying he
vndersto^deth not y^ phrase and manner of speech of the scripture.

THe^ brigeth he in y^ prophet zachary why M More zacharye
ch says. Tu quoqz i sanguine testame^ti tui eduxisti victos tuos de lacu i
quo no^ erat aqua. Thou have in y^ blood of thy testament bro ught out thy
bou^de^ prisoners out of y^ pit or lake i which there was no water. Now in
hell is there no redemption / and in limbo patrum the soule^ were in rest?
wherefore yt appears clerelye that those prisoners which he brought out of
their pain / he brought only out of purgatory

This text is spoke zachary. 9. for a full an (...)
swear of this text I neded no more but to brin (...). 9.

place of y^ spalme ^sal. 66

might I say unto them both that they should first agree with in them selves and
then would I shape them an answer. How be yt I know my part so sure that I

thing of this painful pur gatorye that they descrybe. But My lord of
Rochesters auctoryte shall be dyfferred until the third part which shall be a

^his place verelie approves not purgatory but shows y^ virtue of christ's
rede^pcio^ which through his blood redeemed his captives (...) prisoners yt is
to say the^ who^ he found bound

because they were captyves / bound and empreso ned under the devil through the
sin that ^da^ Romans ^.
committed Romano. v. Why says he that he delyvered them out of the pit
where in is no water? Forsouth that is even as much to say / as he delivered
them out of hell and from eternal dampnacion. Thou will happlye say / he
delive red them not out of hell and from eternal da^pnacion / for his
presoners that is to say / they yt shall be saved never came there. I answer /
that they should with out doubt have gone thither and have been damned
perpetuallye / except yt christ by his deeth had delivered and loosed the^ And
therefore says the scripture that Christ d^ ly vereth us out of hell / because
he saves and delyvereth us yt we come not there / which else should surely
enter into it for ever. It is also a comen manner of speech among us / if a man
should go to prison for debte or any such matter / and one of his friends come
in the mean ceason which pacefyeth the adversaries and pays yt debte / then
may we well say / that he has de ly vered this man out of prison although he

such a man has de ly^ered his friend from the galowes / we mean not that he

be bold to (...) (...) question (...) master More
Master More whether Christ have redeemed / loosed and delivered him in the
blood of his te stament? I think he would answer y^ee. Now if we should ask
him further / from whence he has delivered him? I am sure he is not so igno
raunte as to say that christ has delivered him from purgatory / but even
that he has delyve red him from eternal deeth and dampnacyon. And so has
Christ velyvered us from the pit wherein is no water / that is to say / from
hell and everlastinge dampnacyon / not that we were in hell all ready
(although we were bound under sin and ready to be cast therein but because
we should not enter in to hell. This is the pure understanding of the te^te.
Here might I dispute with him both of hell and of limbus patru^ but because I
will be as short as possible is / I will defer that until a another occasion
/ that I may^ reason with him sumwhat at large.

ANother place is there also in the old testa (...). More.
meant that puts purgatory quyte out of question. For (says he) what is
playner then the places which in the book of the Machabees Macha^ (...).
made mencyon of the devoute remembrance / prayoure / almoyse and sacrifice to
be done for souls / when the good and holy man Judas Machabeus gathered monye
among the people to buy sacrifyce with all to be offered up for the souls of
them that were deed in the battle. What shifte find they here? Surely a
very shamlesse shifte and are (...) to take them to that taklinge which is
their shotea^ker always / when they find the storm so great that they se
their ship goes al to wrack. For first they ^se to set some false gloss
unto the text / and if that help not / then fall they to a shameless
boldness / and let not to deny the scripture and all.

The place which he recyteth is written. 2. Ma Frith.
chabeo. 12. And to say the truth / the book is not 2. Ma. 12.
of (...) auctorite to make an article of our faith: neither is it admitted in
the canon of y^ hebrews. Here he obiecteth that the church has ^lowed it / and
the holy doctoures / as. S. Hiero me. S. Austine and soch other. I answer. S.
Hieromes mind is opened unto us by the pistle which he wrote before the
proverbes of So lomon / his words are these. Sicut Judith et Tobie et
Machabeorum libros / ligit qui^ eo^ ecclesia / sed inter canonicas scripturas
non reci pit / sic et hec duo volumina legate ad edificationem plebis / non ad
authoritat^m ecclesiasticoru^ dogmatum confirmandum. That is / like as the
church does read y^ books of Judith / Thobias / and the Machabees / but
receaveth them not emonge the canonical scriptures / even so let it read these
two books (he means y^ book of sapience and ecclesiasticus) unto the
edefyinge of the people / and not to confirm the doctrine of the church
therbye. And it is nothing like that
S. Austayne should dissente from. S. Hierom / for they were both in one time /
ye and. S. Hierom out lyved. S. Austayne. And therefore the church could not
admit any such books either before. S. Austaynes time or in his time / but
that. S. Hierom should have known of it. And so may you gather that if. S.
Austayne ^lowe these books / or else say yt the church has allowed the^ / you
may not understood yt they ha ue allowed and received them as canonical scri
ptures / for then you make. S. Hierom a (...). But thus you must understood it
/ that they ha ue received them to be red for the edefyinge o^ the people / and
not to confirm the doctrine of the church or articles of the faith thereby
according to. S. Hieroms exposition. Now may^ you se yt our shoteanker (as he
calls it) is so strong that al his storms and waves can not once move it /
for we deny not but that the book is received of ye church to be red and
weshewe by. S. Hierome for whate enten^ it is received and red / not to prove
any article of our faith therbye / but only to order our manner of lyvinge
thereafter in soch points as are not re pugnaunte unto the canonical scripture.

But yet for this once / to do the man pleasu re we will let slip our
shoteanker and take

Besides that it is to be doubted whether Judas did well or not in offerings
this sacrifyce. And therefore oug^t we not of a folish presumpcyon to follow his
fact until we know how it was accepted. Parad venture thou will say that
the deed is commended in the said te xte / where it says: But because he
considered that they which with godliness had entered their sleep (that is their
deeth) had good favor laid up in store for them / therefore is the reme^
braunce to pray for the deed hoiye and ho^esome / that they may be loosed
from their sins. I answer / that the persons which were slain in the
battle for whom this prayer and sacrifyce was made / were found to have
under their clokes oblacyons of idolles which were at Iamniam / and for that
cause were they slain as it is plain in the text / ye and all the host
praised the right judgment of god. Now these men that were so slain were
dampened by the law. Deutero. 7. which says. The images of Deuteronomy. 7
their gods thou shall burn with fire / and se that thou covette not the
silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto the lest thou be snared
therewith / for it is an abominacion unto the lord thy god. Bring not therefore
the abominacio^ unto thine house lest thou be a dampened thing as it is: But
utterly defye it and abhor it for it is a thing that must be destroyed. Of
this may we evide^tlye perceave / that albe al^e (...) did this thing of a
good mind / yet was he de ceaved / for his sacrifyce could nothing help
them since they were dampened by the law / and entered not their sleep with
godliness as he supposed.

Huthermore / it is evident that the Jews Leuitici 4 5 6. (...). But how knew
they that tho se sacrifyces should extend^ them selves unto the sins of the
deed? And they were commanded under the pain of cursinge that they should add
nothing unto the word of god Deuter. 12. (...). 12.
Uerelye it is like that the preastes even at that time sought their own
profytte / abused thesa
(...): fyces / and deceaved the simple people.

Master More also says / that the monye

ye I will go further with you there was not (...). 10
But all the sacrifyces which were then offered /
did but signefye that Christ should come and be made a sacrifyce for us / which
should purge our sin for ever. Now were their sacrifices and oblacions
institute of god and yet could they not take away sin: But only signified
yt Christ through his blood should take it away / what madness the^ is come in
to our brains that we think that our oblacyons which are ordained but of
our own imaginacion should take away sin?

Uvhat if Judas gathered soch an offeringe in the old testament / should it
then follow that

He y^ holds any ceremonye of the law as necessary / is bound to keep and
fulfill the hole law. This is evident of Paul. Gala. 6. where Gala. 6.
he says / If ye be circumcysed / then are ye de^ toures to fulfill the hole
law. That is if ye put any confidence in circumcysio^ or recounte it as
necessary (for (...) it is of it silfe neither good nor evell) then make you
your selves bond un der the law which burden neither we nor our (...). 15
fathers could bear / and tempte god. Act. 15 And this sacrifice of Judas was
but a ceremonye Ba^tel
and signified yt christ should with his blood quench our sins. ergo. he yt
keeps or count th this ceremonye as necessary (as are a^ y^ arti cles of y^
faith) does captiu^ him silfevnder y^ law and te^pteth god to speak no more
sharpelye

yet will I go a little nere unto you. Judas him silfe beleved not that there
was a
lie deceaved that will prove purgatory by the t^xtes of the old testament /
since / as they say the^ selves / there was no purgatory at yt time.

^ynallye / I can not find a place that of it silfe more properlye confuteth
this fantastical ^e again. But if there were a purgatory when
rin they should be purged and punished in the mean ceason / then were it not
in vain to pra ye for them to deliver them out of that pain / but rather
very fruitful and necessary although they should never rise again. and
therefore if this text be of auctorite / it is impossible yt there should be any
purgatory / neither is there any text that in my judgment can better under
mine purgatory and make it fall

Parad venture you desire to know my min de in this place / and that I should
expound unto you what Judas meant in his oblacion since he thought of no
purgatory as the for said text does well specefye. Uerelye I think that
Judas believed that there should be a resurreccion / as this text prayseth him
saying / thinkin ge well and devoutelye of the resurrection. For emonge the
Jews there were many that bele ved not the resurrection of our flesch / and
they that beleved it were yet so rude and ignoraunte / that they thought they
should rise but to obtain a carnal kingdone and have their enemies subdued
under them with out rebellion. And thereto stick the Jews unto this day. And
it is most like yt this should be his meaning / we shall all rise again and
possess this land in pe ace / and these men which are slain are out of the
favor of god because they have contrary Deute. 7.
to y^ law. Deuteronomy. 7. taken of the Idolles oblacions / therefore is it best that
we send a sacrifice unto Jerusalem to pacefye the wrath of god toward them /
lest when they rise again the lord should send some plage amongst us for
their transgression which they committed whi le they were here lyvinge. If any
man can better guess I am well content to admit it / but this is plain
enough: he thought that this sacrifice could not help the^ before they should
rise again / which does fullye destroy purgatory. For where he says that
it were voyed and in vain to pray for y^ deed except they should rise again:
Is even as mo^h to say unto him that has any wit / as that this prayer and
sacrify ces can do them no good before they be risen again from deeth: for else
were it not in vain to pray for the^ although they should never rise again.
As by example / if I say to a man that he shall never optaine his purposse
except he shul de sue to y^ kings grace / it is even as much to say to a m^
y^ has any wit / as he shall never obtain his purposse before he has sued
to y^ kings highness.

Master More goes a boute to ^est them Master
out of contenaunce which say that the book (...)
of Machabees is not autentyke because yt is not received in the Canon of the
hebrews and says that by this reason we may also deny y^ book of sapience
and prove our selves insip^ ent^s: but (...) / if he admit the book of sap^
ence to be true and autentike / I fear me it will go nigh to prove him an
insipient for granting yt there is a purgatory. Read y^. 45. argument ag^st
Rastell and the^ judge whether I say true or not.

Hitherto have I let slip our shoteanker and have run y^ sees with him /
grau^tinge him for any man would require my judgment as co^cernin ge this book
/ I would shortly answer that ey there this book is false and of no auctoryte
/ or else that Christ and his apostles all holy doctoures and scolemen thereto
are false and with out auctoryte. For he that admits prayers and sacrifyce
to be done for the deed / ye and also af fermeth that they are holy and
holesom forsuch sins as are damned by the law of god (which are in deed
very mortal) does not he a genst the word of god / ye and also agen^t the
comen consent of all men? But this book does so: which admits prayer and
sacryfice to be done for the deed that were slain in the battay le for their
offense / ye and also dampened by the law Deutero. 7. Now conclude your selves
what ye think of this book. Deu. 7.


Thus much has Master More brought (to prove his purposse) out of the old
testament and I think ye se yt suffycyentlye answered. And now he entendeth to
prove his purga torye by good and substancy all auctory te in the new testament
also.

FIrst let us considre (says Master More) the words of y^ blessed apostle
and e^ange M. More
gelist. S. Joan. where he says. Est peccatu^ ad 1. Joan. 5.
morte^ / no^ dico vt pro eo roget qs There is says he some sin yt is unto
the deeth / I bid not y^ any man should pray for yt / this sin as y^ in
terpreters agree is vnderstonden of desperacyon and impenitencie / as though
Sayint Joan / would say / that who depart out of this world impenytent or in
despair / any prayer after made can never stand him instead. Then it
appareth clerelye that. S. Joan. mea^ neth that there are other which dye not
in such case for whom he would men should pray / beca use that prayer / to
such souls may be profitable. But that profit can no man take being in hea
^en where et needs not nor being in hell where it boteth not / wherefore it
appears y^ such prayer helps only for purgagorye / which thou must
therefore needs grant except thou deny. S. Johan.

The text is written. 1. Joan. 5. which says Frith.
there is a sin unto the deeth / I bid not that 1. ^an. 5.
any man shall pray for that. In this place does Master More understood by
this word deeth / temporal deeth / and then he takes his pleasure. But we
will desire him to look. ij. lines abo ue / and not to snatch one piece of the
text on this facion. I will rehearse you the hole text and then ye shall hear
mine answer. The text is this / if any man perceave that his brother does
(...) / a sin not unto the deeth / let him ask and he shall give him liffe /
to the^ that sin not unto ^th. For there is sum sin that is unto dee th /
I bid not that any man should pray for tha (...). Now (...) mine answer.
Deeth an liffe (...) contrary and both words are in this tex te / t (...) if
you understand this word deeth (...) emporall deeth / the^ must you also
vndersto^ de (...) this word liffe / te^porall liffe. And so shul^
(...) prayer restore men again unto tempo rall (...). But I ensure you /
Mastre More taket (...) this word deeth so confusedlye / that no (...) can
tell what he means. For in one place he takes it for temporal deeth /
saying / who so (...) out of this world impenite^t etc^. and (...) a another
place he is compelled to take it for therlastinge deeth. Therefore will I show
you y^ very understanding of y^ text. And better in ^erpreters desire I none
then Christ him self which said unto the pharisees / everye blasphe Marc. iij.
mye shall be forgeuen / but the blasphemye against the holy ghost (which. S.
Ihoan calls a sin unto the deeth) shall never be forgeven / but is ^iltye
unto everlastinge dampnacion. Mar. iij. that sin or blasphemye is this?
^erelye y^ declares. S. Marc. saying: They said that he had an unclean
sprete that was the sin un to deeth everlastinge / that was the sin / that
should never be forgeven. He proved so evident lie unto them that his miracles
were done with the sprete of god / that they could not deny it. and yet of an
hard and obstinate heart / even knowinge the contrary / they said that he
had (...) devell with in him. These pharisees died not forth with / but l^ ved
paraduenture many yes^es after. Notwithstondinge if all the apostles had
prayed for these (...) whiles they were yet ly vinge / for all that their sin
should never have been forgeuen them. And truth it is that after they died in
impenitencye and dispeta^on / which was the fruit of that sin / but not the
sin it silfe.

Now se ye the meaning of this text / and The pu^ vnderston dinge.
what the sin unto deeth or agenst the holy ^ost is. If any man perceave his
brother ^o sin a sin not unto deeth / that is / not agen^ yt holy ghost:
let him ask and he shall geve him lif fe / that is / let him pray unto god
for his brother and his sin shall be forgeuen him. But if h^ se his brother
sin a sin unto deeth y^ is / against the holy ghost / let him never pray
for him for it ^oteth not. And so is not the text understand of prayer after
this liffe (as Master More imageneth) but even of prayer for our brother which
is ly vinge with us.

Notwithstondinge this sin is not lighlye knoune / except y^ person
knowledge it him silfe / or else the (...) of god open it unto us. There fore may
we pray for all men / except we have evident knowledge that they have so
offended as is before rehearsed. And thus is his text taken from him wherewith
he labors to prove purgatory.

Uvhat say they to the words of S. Joan. M. More
Apoca. 5. I have hard (says he) everye creatu (...). 5
re that is in heaven and upon the earth / and un der the earth / and that be in
the sea and all things that be in them / all these have I hard say /
benediction / and honor / and glory / and power for ever be to him / that is
sittinge in the tro ne and unto yo lamb. By the creatures in heaven he means
angels. By the creatures upon (...)
the earth / he means men. By the creatures under the earth / he means the
souls in purgatory. And by the creatures in y^ see he means men that sail
on the sea.

By this text I understand not only angel les and men / but also heaven and
earth and all y^ ^rith.
is in them / even all beestes / fishes / worms / and other creatures and
think that all these creatures do praise the lord. And where he takes the
creatures under the earth for y^ souls in pur gatorye: I take it for all manner
of creatures under the earth / both worms (...) and all other And where he
draws the text and makes y^ creatures in the sea / to signifye me^ that are
saylinge on the sea: I say that the creatures in the sea do signifye fishes /
and such other things / (...) that. S. Joan by this text meant even plainly
that all manner of things give praise unto god and the lamb / ye and I dare
be bold to add that even the very devels and damned souls are co^yelled to
praise him. For their just punishment commends his puysaunte power and
rightwisenes. Neither neadest thou to wondr^ or think. this any new thing for
David in y^ 148 / bids serpents bestes and birds to praise the lord / as
it is also written (...). iij. And Paul says. Roma. 8. All manner of creatures
long for our redempcyon and praise god for it / ye and mourn that the last
day is not yet come that the elect children of god might enter in to rest:
for then shall also those creatures be (...) vered from their corrupcyon and
bondage in to the liberty and glory of the children of god. Now judge
christen reader which sentence stondeth most with the scripture and glory of
god.

Does not the blessed apostle. S. Peter as it m. More
appears Acts. ij. say of our savioure Christ in this wise. Quem deus
suscitauit solu it is doloribus inferni. In these words he showed that pains of
hell were loosed: but those pains were not the pains of dampened souls. And
in limbo patrum there was no pain / ^rgo it was the pains of purgatory which
he loosed.

Alas / what shall I say? I am in a manner Frith
compelled to say that this man wandereth in wilful blindness. For else were
it not possible yt he should err so far as to bring in this text for his
purposse.

The words of Peter are these / ye me^ of Israel hear these words: Jesus of
Nazareth a man set forth of god for you with powers / wondres and tokens
which god has done by him a monge you (as you your selves know) after he was
delyvered by the purposed council and for^knowlege of god / and you received
him of the hands of the wyked / ye crucyfyed and killed him / whom god has
raised dissoluynge the pains of deeth / for it was impossible that he should
be subdued of it. Here in stead / of these words / the pains of deeth / he
sets the pains of hell (as it is most like) even of a purposed deceyte. For
all be it the man would not take the pain to read y^ greek / yet if he had but
once lo^ed upon the translacion of his old frinde and companion Erasmus / it
would have taught him to have said solut is doloribus mortis / that is /
dissolvinge the pains of deeth / aceordinge to y^ greek and very words of
luke which wrote the se Acts in the greek tongue.

And albeit the old translacion uses this word infernus / which is diverslye
taken in scri pture / both for deeth / for a grave and for hell / yet in this
place is Master More with out excuse which calls it hell in our English
tongue. For all be it the word of it silfe were indifferent in the latyne /
yet it is not indifferent in the English. For there is none English man that
takes this word hell / either for deeth or for a (...) / no not Master More
him silfe. For first he translateth the text falselye calling it hell / and
then he discanteth on a false ground and calls hell / not deeth / but
purgatory. (...) S. (...) brought in these words for no another purposs^ but to
prove that Christ was risen from deeth through the power of his father /
meaning that god the father did raise his son Christ notwithstondinge the
sorrowful pains and pa^ges which he suffered unto the deeth / for it was
impossible that Christ should be utterly subdued of deeth. So that this text
proves no more purgatory / then it proves that Maste^ More was hired of the
spiritualtye to defend purgatory. Besides that / if it should serve for
purgatory (which no wysem^n will graunt^ when he sees the process of the
text) it should prove nothing but that Christ should lie in the pains of
purgatory / until god his father had help him out / for the pains which he
speaks off / were Christ's pains / which no man can de nigh if he read the
text. But whate a fond o^ nion were that / to feign that Christ which was
with out sin should be tourmented in y^ pains of purgatory?

^he blessed apostle Paul in his first epistle to the Corinthians the third
chaptre spea M. (...)
king of our savioure Christ the very and on 1. Cor. 3
lie fundacyon of all our faith and salvation / says. If any man bylde upon
this fundacyo^ gold / silver / preciousstones / wod / hay or straw / everye
man's work shall be made open / for the day of the lord shall declare it / for
in the fire it shall be showed / and the (...) shall prove what manner of thing
(...) man's work is If any man's work that he has builded the ten do
abide / he shall have a reward / if any man's work burn / he shall suffer
harm / but he shall be saffe / but yet as by fire. And finallye co^ cludeth that
this word fire / must signifye the fi (...) of purgatory.

^e that considers the order and process Frith.
of the text shall easelye perceive that this man (...). For the text
speaks of the preachers / and blames the corinthians that they made soch
sects and dissensions emonge them selves / for one said that he was Paul's
man and he^ de on his side. A another said that he was Peter's man. The third
did stick to Apollo and so forth / even as our fryres do now a days / one
sect holds on S. fraunces / A another of S Dominike / the third of. S.
Austyne. (...). S. Pau le rebuked these sects and called the persons carnal
/ commaundinge them to take Christ for their head and to cleave only to him.
And as for Apollo / Peter and Paul / he says that they are but ministres of
the word / everye man according to the gift geven him of god / the one more
the other less.

^aule planted Apollo watered / that is / Pau le set the corinthians in the
ground of Christ's faith / and then came Apollo and preached them further of
Christ and comforted them to abide in the way which they walked in. How be it
/ it was only god that made them prosper in the word and gave the increase.
Nevertheless eve rye man shall receave according to his labor. If he preach
much the more shall be his rewar de / if he preach little / thereafter shall he be
rewar ded. For we are gods workeme^ to preach his word / and you are gods
husbandrye whom we must till and dress in declaringe you the word and
perpetual will of god / you are become gods buyldinge through the grace of
god which he has geven me / whom we must frame and so couch by the word of
god that we may make of you a temple of lyvinge stones. Like a wise
workemaster have I laid the fun dacyon / for I first begane to preach you
Christ. Now comes there a another and buyldeth upon this my fundacyon
entendinge to enstru^ cte you further in the ways of Christ. But let everye
man take heed how he buyldeth or preach unto you / for no man can lay any
other fundacion then is laid all ready / for all our buyldinge and preachinge
leneth only on this point and principal stone / to declare unto you what
Christ has done for you.

If any build on this fundation gold / silver or precious stones / that is /
if any man preach purelye the word of god / which is lykened to gold / silver
/ and precious stones / because that as these are not consumed with material
fire / but rather made more pure / even so the pure word of god suffers
neither hurt nor damage in spiritual fire / that is temptacion and
persecution.

Or else if any man build upon this fundacion wod / hay or stubble / that is
/ if a man of good entente (but yet through ignorance) preach and teach you to
stick unto ceremonies and men's tradicions (although they seem never so
glorious) and to soch things as are not grounded on scripture (as. S. Cipriane
taught Ciprian
and defended to rebaptise him / that was once baptized and after fallen in to
heresye / ye and many bisshopes consented unto him / yet was it surely a
great error) this is wod / hay and stubble that ca^ not endure the fire of
temp tacyon and light of gods word.

^verye (...) work shall be declared for yt day shall open it. Albeit it
prospere for a ceason in the dark and can not be perceyved / yet when the day
comes / which is the light of gods word / it shall be espied and judged. The
day shall open it that shall be revelated in fire / and the fire shall prove
everye man's work what it is. Fire signifies temptacio^ / tribulacyo^ /
persecution. etc^. which shall prove everye man's works. If any man's work
that he has builded do abide this fire / that is / if the word that a man
has preached do abide all assautes and temptacions / it is a token that they are surely grounded on the scripture of god / and the^ shall the preacher
receyve his reward. If any man's work be burnte / that is if y^ preachers
word^s will not abide the trial and light but vani^h away / then is it a
token that they are not well grounded on scripture / and so shall he suffer
hurt / for it shall be a great cross and vex acyon to the preachers heart that
he has been so deceyved him silse and has also led other in to his error.
Notwithstondinge he shall be saved / because of his faith in the fundacio^ /
which is Christ / and his ignora^unce shall be pardoned since he erreth not of a
malicious purposse but of a good zele. But yet shall it be as it were a fire to
him / for it shall grieve his heart to se that he has labored in vain / and
that he must destroy the same which he before through ignorance preached: this
is the process and pure un derstondinge of the text.

There is no man but he grau^teth y^ these words / fundacyon / layinge of
fundacyon / buyl dynge / gold / silver / precious stoones / wod / hay and
stubble are figuratyuelye spoken: and why can they not suffer that this word
(...) be so taken to? But where they find this word fire / what so ever the
process be / there plance they purgatory by and by / with out any further
consyderacyon. And yet if they had any iudg^ment at all / they might well
perceive by paul's own words that he took not this worcester de fire fore materyall
fire / as they grosselye ima gyne) but proceeded in his allygorye and spoke yt
fyguratyuelye: for paul says / he shall be sa ued / but so as yt were through
fire. Mark well his words / he says not that he shall be saved through fire /
But as yt were through fire sygnyfyinge that yt shall be a great (...) and
vexatyon unto him. So that by these words of paul / a very child may
perceave what he meant.

Hurthermore / if they be so styffnecked that they will not bow to the truth /
but (...) persevere in their own phantasyes sayninge a purgatory out of this
place: then will I boldelye say unto the^ that there shall no man enter in to
yt but only prechers. For in this pla ce paul only speaks of them / and
affermeth that it is their preaching and lerninge that shallbe so proved
through fire / and that such a preacher shall be saved / but yet as yt were through
fire And therefore may the temporaltye be of good comfort / for I promysse
them that by this text they shall never have hurt in this their paynfull
purgatory.

Does not our blyssed savioure him self say that there is a certain sin
which a M More
man may so commit agenst the holy ghost / Mat. 12.
that yt shall never be remitted nor forgeuen / neither in this world nor in
the world to come? Now when our lord says that the blas phemye agenst the
holy^ ghost shall not be forge ven neither in this world nor in the worl de to
come / he geveth us clear knowledge / that of other sins some shall be forgeven
in this world and some in the world to come.

Although this argument be a very Frith
sophysme / yet is there neither one rule in so phystrye that can prove this
argument / nor yet one sophyster so folysh as to grant yt.

For if I should say unto mine enemy that I would neither forgive him as
long as I lyved nor after my deeth because he had done me some haynouse
trespass / then would men count him worse them mad that would say / Frith
will not forgive his enemy as long as he lyveth nor after his deeth / ergo
some men will forgive their enimyes after their deeth.

For when I say that I will not forgive him neither in my liffe nor after my
deeth / I mean that I will never forgive him / and make that addicion because
he should not of folysh nes look for any such forgevenesse.

But thus follows the argument well / it shall not be forgeuen in this world
nor in the worl de to come / ergo it shall never be forgeuen.

And even so does Saint Marce expound these words of christ in the third
chaptre.

For Matthew says in the. xii. He that speaks ag enst the holy ghost /
shall never have yt forgeuen in this world nor in the world to Marc. 3.
come: Marc. expounds yt thus / he that spea keth a blaspemye / agenst the
holy ghost / has no remission for ever / but is giltye unto everlasting
damnacyon.

But of this have I spoken suffycientlye before (in solutynge the text. 1.
Joan. 5.) both what the sin is and also how the text is to be understand.

Neither affe^meth the scripture in any place yt any sin is forgiven after
this liffe / but says be ready for ye know not the time when the lord shall
come / as who should say / in this life is remissyon and full mer cye to ^e
had / labor therefore to attain yt for after this life is no such forgevene
sse / but eue^ as y^ lord fyndeth y^ so shall he judge y^. His next and last
argu me^t of scriptu re is this M Mo^


Christ saeyth / as yt is rehearsed in y^. xii. Mat. 12.
of Matthew / y^ men shall yield a reckoning of everye idle word / and that
shall be after this present lyffe. The^woteth every man that by that rekeninge
is understand a punyshme^t therefore / which shall not be in hell / and much
less in heaven / and therefore ca^ yt be now here else but in Frith
purgatoye. (...) I have not hard of a partone that so unprofitable defends
his clyent / nor yet of any man that gives him sylfe such propre trippes to
cast him self / except he w^nt about to betraye and utterly destroy the
part which he would seem to favor / for this text makes more agenst him /
the^ any that he brought before seems to make wi th him. The words of
Mathewe are these / I tell you that of everye idle word that men spe ache /
shall they yield a rekeninge in y^ day of iu dgement / but that leuet^ he out
full craftelye. Now let us reason of this text. By the rekenin ge is
understand a punishment for the sin (as Master More says him silfe) and
this re keninge shall be upon the day of dome / ergo then this punishment for
sin can not be before the day of dome / but either upon or else after the
day of dome. For god will not first punish them and then after reken with the^
to punish them anewe. And so is purgatory quyte excluded. For all they that
ever imagined any purgatory do put it before the judgment / for when christ
comes to judgment / then cease p^rgatorye as they all consent / neither is
there any prayer or sufrage which at that time ca^ do any help at all. And so
has master More by this text geven him silfe a propre fall

Here may you se ^ow strong his reasons are and what will happen to him that
takes in ha^ de to defend the falsehed agenst the truth of gods word / for
his reasons make more against him then with him. you may well know that if his
matter had been any thing likelye / he wol de have colored it if a another
facion. But since such a patron / so greatly commended for his conveyaunce and
wisdom / handles this mat ter so slenderlye / you may well mistrust his cau
se. Th^s is the last reason grounded of scripture where with he has labored to
prove purgatory. And after his reason he rekeneth up the doctoures / and
says for his pleasure that all make for him / but as touching the doctors I
will make a suffycient answer in the third part which is agenst my lord of
Rochestre.

Thus he leueth the scripture which he has full vnmanerlye handled / and now
endeavors him silfe to prove his purposse by some pro babble reasons / And
first he brings in his old argument that the church can not err / to the
which reason I need not to answer / for wyllyam Tindale has declared
abundantlye / in a treatise which by gods grace you shall shortly have /
whate the church is / and also that it both may err and does err / if the
pope and his adherentes be the church as master More imagines. M. More


After this he confirms his phantasye with fantastical apparicions /
saying: that there have in every contre and in everye age ap paricions been
had / and well known and testified / by which men have had suffycient
revelation and pro^e of purgatory. How many have / by gods most gracious
favor / appeared to their friends after their deeth / and showed them selves
helped and delivered thence by pil grimages / almosedede / prayer etc^. If they
say y^ these be lies / then be they much worse the^ their master Luther him
silfe / for he co^senteth in his sermons that many such apparicions be tru^ /
and if they be true / then must there needs be a purgatory.

Here plays master More the sotle soph^ ^ter and would deceave me^ with a
fallace which lies in this word / true / so that when he says that such
apparicions be true / this sentence ma ye be taken two manner of ways. One /
that it is true that such pha^tastical apparicions do ap pear to diverse / and
that I think no man be so folish but he will grant him.

And yet in deed are they no souls but very devels that so appear to delude
men / that they should fall from the faith of Christ and make a god of their
own works trustinge to be saved therebye. But to suppose this true / y^ they
are the souls of purgatory which so appear / is very fond / false and
agenst al scriptu re / for Esai says / shall we goo for the quick unto the
deed? that is / shall we inquire of the ^sal. 8.
deed and believe them in such points as concern our wealth? Nay says he /
but unto the law and witness / that is unto god and his word.

And so are we monished by Esaias in the. 8. that we believe no such phantasyes /
we are also commanded by the law of god / that we inquire not of the deed /
not for the truth / for god abhors it Deuteronomye. xviij.

Besides that the parable of the rich man and Lazarus does utterly condemn
all such appa ricyons / that they are no souls which appear but very devels.
For when the rich man desired that Lazarus might go and warn his brothren /
that they should not come in to that place (...). 16
of pain / Abraham answered / that they had Moses and the Prophets / addinge
also that if they beleved not them / then would they not believe although one
should rise again and tell it them.

And so may I conclude that it were in vay (...) to send them any such
apparicions of sou^ / and that in very deed there are no souls ^ent of god /
but that they are verelye devels which come to delude the people / and to
withdraw them from Christ. Furthermore all men grant that the appearinge of
Samuel was but an illusion of the devell / thou shall find y^ 1. Reg. 28.
storye. 1. Regum. xxviij.

It is not long since such a question was mo ved in oxforth / the thing was
this / there was a poor man of the country / which was sore troubled with such
apparicions / for there came a thing to him which desired him to go certain
pilgrimages and to do certain other ceremonies wherbye it said that it should
be delivered from innumerable tourmentes which it now suffered. The poor man
beleved that this thing said truth / and did as it commanded.
Notwithstondinge it came so often unto him / that what with labor and whate
with fear / the man was almost besides him silfe / and then was he sent to
Oxforth to ask counsel what was best to be done. The question was moved to
one doctoure Nicolas / and he affirmed by and by that it was no soul but the
very devell / and that he should no more follow the fendes appitite. Then was
it moved to doctoure kington / and he affirmed the same. Finallye / they
inquired of doctoure Roper what his mind was the rin / and he said that he
would look on his book / and when he had looked his pleasure / he gave this
answer. Let him alone awhyle (quod he) ^ I warrant you / y^ this follow shall
either hang him silfe / or droune him silfe / or come to some other mische^.
Thus determined these me^ / wh ^h are a great deal to supersticious to
dissent from any of the old doctors / ye or else from their a wne scolemen.
And yet would Master More make us beleve that they were very sou tes / and
that by such ceremonies they might b^ delyvered.

Now comes Master More to solute tho se two reasons that were brought agenst
purga torye in the supplycacyon of beggars / which was the hole occasyon of his
book. And mark how sle^der his solucyo^s are. The first reason is this. If
there were any purgatory out of which the pope might deliver one soul by his
pardo ne / then may he by the same auctoryte deliver many: and if he may
deliver many / the^ may he deliver them all. The second reason is this. If
he can deliver them for money: then may he also deliver them with out monye.
And then is he a very cruel tyraunte which hepeth them in pains so
intolerable (as he imagines him self) until they pay monye.

THe first he soluteth on this manner. Sith (...). More
our lord sends the^ thither for satisfaccyon to be made in some manner for
their sin: the pope should rather agenst gods purposse delyver them fre
them change the manner of their satisfaccyon from pain in to prayer / almose
or other good works to be done by their friends for them in some point
profitable and necessary for the hole corpse of christendom or some good
membre of the same. Frith


^s concerning satisfaccion / I have spoken sufficientlye before agenst
Rastell. The scripture knows no another satisfaccyon to be made for sin
toward god / but only the blood of his son Jesus christ. for if there were
a another satisfaccyon / then dyed christ in vain: ye and he that seeks any
other satisfaccyon for his sin (toward god) then christ's blood (why

Besides that where he says that if ye pope should so deliver them / he
should deliver the^ fre. I say nay. For the pope ca^ deliver no man from
thence until satisfaccio^ be made / as both he and all his ad here^tes
grant. And therefore to find away how he might seem to deliver the^ / he
fayneth that he has in his hands the merytes of christ's passion / and the
merits of al saints to destribute them at his pleasure.

And therefore might ye pope apply the merits of christ's passion and of other
saints unto the se selye souls and so deliver the^. For those meri tes are
enough to satisfye for the souls in pur gatorye / if there were ten times so
many. And so should y^ pope deliver the^ not fre / but chau^ginge the manner of
their satisfaccyon from pay ^e / in to merits of christ's passion and of al
sain tes. And so is this reason not abated but rather stronger the^ it was
before. Now be it to say the truth / the merits of christ's passion are only
dystrybuted unto the faithful / and that by god and his sprete and not by y^
pope. And as for the merits of saints can not help other / for they have to
little for them selves if god should enter in to judgment with the^ psalm. 104.
And christ says Luc. 17. when you have done al yt is Christ says
commanded you / say we are unprofitable servauntes. To this well agrees the
parable of the ten virgins. Mat. 25. which could not ^e part with any of their
oil / for fear that they should not have had enough fore them selves.

THe second reason byteth him somewhat / and therefore he calls it unreasonable
and would avoyde it by an example on this wise. ^resupposed that y^ pope may
deliver all sou le^ out of purgatory / yet if he were therefore ^rn M. More
ell as often as he leueth any there / this vnreson^ ble reason lies crueltye
unto the blame of god which may undoubtedly deliver al souls then ce / and
yet he leaves them there. This blasph^ mye should also touch his hye matestye
for kepinge any soul in hell / from whence no man douteth but that he might if
he list deliver the^ all for ever.

I answer / that the example is nothing ly Frith
ke for god can deliver no man / neither from hell nor purgatory (if such one
were) until his justice be countrepaysed / as I have suffy^yentlye proved
agenst Rastell. And if you obiect^ his absolute power / then answer I that he
has an absolute justice as well as an absolute power / and so can his absolute
power do nothing until his absolute justice de satisfied. And again I say /
yt god has no power nor lust to do agenst his scripture and him silfe / but
his power and lust is to fulfill yt he has promised unto ye faithful
everlasting glory / and unto y^ wyked et^rnall da^nacion. So yt god by his
scripture ca^ deliver no man out of hell / for the^ had he power to make him
silfe a liar and so we ^e he no god: neither can he deliver any man out of
purgatory (supposed that there were one) until his justice be pacefyed. But
the pope as he says him sylfe) has the full satysfa^ on in his own hand
wherbye gods (...) must be pacefyed: wherefore yt is only the (...) pes fault
/ wh^h has the satisfaction in his po were and will not give it till he have
monye / and not gods fault which must needs tarry until satisfactyon be made.
And so is this reason as strong as it was before / and the pope proved a
cruel tyraunte.

BUt yet to excuse the pope he says / It is M. More
not mete that the pope should be so quycke in delyueraunce: for so should he
give a gre ate occasyon to men boldlye to fall in to sin and little to care
or fear how slowlye they rise again / and that were not mete for his office.

Horsouth this is a ientle reason. He may Frith
not be quick in delyueraunce because he should give men occasyon of sin.
But for one penye he will quyte deliver you and that with spead. For if ye
offer a penye unto Saint Dominykes box / as soon as ye h^are the penye rin ge
in the box / even so sone is the soul in heaven. Call you not that quick
delyueraunce? If you give not that penye / then may he not deliver the soul /
for yt should be an occasyon of sin. But if you geve that penye / then is
there no such occasyon of sin. Such great virtue has that one penye in
Master Mo res sight / that yt clean wypeth away the occasyon Note wh at virtue
is in a p^ nigh
of sin.

Hurthermore / if this redempcyon may be done for monye / yt shall be stylle an
occasyon unto the rych that they regard not sin / and yet had they more need
to be brydled then ^he poor: for where richesse and abundaunce is there
reigns sin most of all. How be it I have showed sufficientlve before agenst
Rastell / that they which fear not to sin but for fea re of purgatory /
shall never come in it but be da^ ned in hell. For we should not abstain from
sin for any fear / but for the pure love that we have to god our most
merciful father. etc^.

THen comes Master More to this imagi (...). More.
nacyon / that we should say / how no man's prayer or good dead ca^ help a
another. And says he if that were true / then could not christ's bitter
passion profit us.

Sir mine opinion of Christ's deeth is this ^th
We have al sinned in Adam / with out our aw 1
ne consent and work.

And we are losed from sin through Christ / 1
with out our works or deservinges.

Sin is comen in to the world through Adam 2
and is punished with deeth

The deeth through Christ is turned in to a me 2
dicyne and clean finisheth sin.

One man's sin which is Adam / has conde^ 3
ned many men.

One man's grace which is Christ / has vanqueshed 3
sin and helped many.

If one man's sin be able to condemn us 4
with out our works.

Then much more is gods grace of power to 4
save us with out our works.

Sin through Adam was planted in us. 5


Grace through Christ is planted in us. 5


Sin has had dominion over all men through 6
Adam.

Grace prevayleth over us through Christ 6


Deeth through sin is planted in us. 7


Liffe through grace is planted in us 7


Deeth through sin has dominion over us. ^


Liffe through grace prevayleth over us. 8


Sin and deeth have condemned all men. 9


Grace and liffe have saved all men. 9


Through Adam / Adams sin was counted our 10
own:

Through Christ / Christ's rightwysnesse is repu 10
ted unto us for our own.

Of this may you perceave that we think that Christ's deeth profits us /
for we take his deeth and resurrection for our hole rede^ cyon and salvation.
Now as concerning men's good deades and prayers / I say that they profitte
our neighbors: ye and good works were ordained for that intent that I
should profit my neighbor through them: And prayer ought to be made to god
for everye state. But if I should grant that such works and prayers should
help them that are departed / then should I speak clean with out my bo ke /
for the word of god knows no such thing. Let them therefore that pray for
the deed exa mine them selves well with what faith they do it / for faith
leans only on the word of god / so that where his word is not / there can
be no good faith: and if their prayer proceed not of faith / surely it can not
please god Hebre. xj.

NOw suppose (says master More) yt purgatory m. More
could in no wise be proved by scri pture / and that some would yet say
plainly yt there were one / and some would say plainly nay / let us now se
whether sort of these twain might take most harm / if their part were ye
wrong. Furst he that beleved there were pur^ / and that his prayer and good
works wrought for his friends souls might relyeve them therein / and because
of that used much pra per and almose for them / he could not lose y^ reward
of his good will although his opinion we re untrue and that there were no
purgatory at all. But on the the other side / he that beleveth there is none and
therefore prays for none: if his opinion be false and that there be purgatory
in dead / he les^th much good / and gets him al so much harm. For he both
fears much less to sin / and to lie long in purgatory / savinge that his
heresye shall keep him thence / and send him down deep in to hell.

I answer / that he should take most harm Frith.
that beleved there were a purgatory / if his opinion were wrong and coul^e
not be proved by the scripture (as master More supposed) for he should sin
and transgress agenst the law of god which says Deuteronomye. xij. That I
command the / yt only do unto the lord / neither add any thing nor
diminish. And before in the. iiij. chaptre of y^ same book / ye shall not add
unto the word that I speak unto you neither shall ye take any thing from it.
And again in the. v. chaptre ye shall not decline neither to the right hand
(doing y^ which is good in your own sight) neither yet unto y^ left hand /
doing that which I manifestly forbide you as though he should say / do that
only which I command the. And where master More says yt he can not lose
the reward of his good will / although his opinion be untrue. I answer yes
for it is but chosen holiness which Paul condemns Colos. ij. which surely
shall rather be imputed unto him for sin then for any good work. And because
(as I said before) it can not be done through faith / I say that it is utter
lie reproved of god. And on the the other side he yt beleveth it not / since it can
not be proved by scripture / can catch no harm at all / although his opinion
were false / but rather much good and praise both of god and all good men:
because he fears to swerve from the word of god / and had lever not to
believe yt thing which is true (be it in case that purgatory were) and not
set forth in scripture / for so shall he be sure not to sin: the^ to beleve
for an article of the faith that thin ge which is false in dead / for so should
he surely sin and transgress agenst god and his holy word. And so is
there great perell to believe a thing for an article of the faith which is not
opened nor spoken of in scripture: But if I believe it not (allthough it were
true) yet is there no right nor law that can condemn me, Now ma ye you se /
that to believe for an article of ye faith that there is a purgatory / since it
can not be pro ved by scripture / may condemn a man and make him lie for ever
in the pains of hell / where as the the other should but a little longer lie in
the pains of purgatory (if there were one) and so shall he be sure to catch
most harm that beleveth there is a purgatory. Savinge (says ma m. (...).
ster More) that his heresye shall keep him from thence / and send him down
deep in to hell.

Before he supposed that it could not be proved by scripture. And now
(stondinge the sa Frith.
(...) supposicyon) he calls it an heresye / and an heresye is a stiff
holden opinion repugnaunte unto scripture. If purgatory can not be proved by
scripture (as he makes his supposition) then can not the contrary opinion be
nepugnaunte to scripture / and thus of his own supposition he does evell to
call it an heresye. And where he says / that his opinion shall send him down
deep in to hell / verelye he steppeth to far in gods judgment to conclude
and det^ne so cruellye / and specially in the same ar gument where he
supposes that it can not be proved / for if it can not be proved by scripture
/ wherbye will ye condemn him so deep that holds y^ contrary? forsouth you

Now may you well perceave what a slender fundacion their note purgatory
has. For by this confutacion may you easilye se that it has no ground nor
auctorite of scripture. Not withstandinge it is the fundacyo^ of all religions
and cloisters / ye and of all the goods yt now are in the spiritualtye. Are
not they wyttye worcester kemen which can build so much on so slender a fundacio^?
How be it they have made it so top pehevye / that it is surely like to have a
falie. Thus has Master More a full a^swere / both to his scriptures which were
to far wrested out of their places / and also to his own apparent reasons.
How be it if his mastershippe be not fullye pacyfyed / let him more groundlye
open his mind / and bring for his purposse all that he thinks to make for
it and I shall by gods grace shortly make him an answer and guyet his
mind.

Thus ends the second book.
The third book / which answers unto my lord of Rochestre and declares the
mind of the old do^oures.
NOw will I address me to the third part / which shall be an answer unto my
lord of Rochestre. And al his reasons and arguments both of scriptures and
doctures which are not be fore dissolved in the second par te will I clean
confute by gods grace in this third book. How be it the che fest of his
scriptures has Master More perused and has in a manner nothing but that was
before written by my lord of Rochestre / savinge that he makes the selye
souls to pule to help his matter with all. My lord of Rochestre is the first
patron and defeudar of this phantasye. And even as Master More took his work
out of my lord ^f Rochestres / even so plucked Rastell as his book out of
Master Mores

My lord of Rochestre to confirm his sentence / rekeneth up the doctoures by
heap: ma ster Johan / master Uvyllyam / master Thomas et omnes. But as
concerning the doctoures y^ they are not so fullye on his side as he would
make them seem / is sone proved. And where should I better begin to confute
him then of his own words? for he writes him silfe upon the. xviij. article
on this manner.

^Here is no man now a days that douteth Rochestre
of purgatory / says he / and yet emonge the old ancient fathers was there
either none or else very seldom mencyon made of it. And also emonge the
grecians even unto this day is not purgatory beleved. Let him read yt will
the commentaryes of the old grecians / and as I suppose he shall find either
no word spoken of it or else very few. these are my lords words. I wondre
what obliuiousnes is come^ upon Frith
him that he so cleaves unto the doctures / who^ he affirmed before either to
make no mencyon of it or else very seldom. Notwithstondinge I will declare you
somwhate of the doctures / that you may the better know their meaning.

To speak of the doctures and what their mind was in this matter / it were
necessary to declare in what time they were and what condi cyon the world was
in in their days. S. Austyne Ambrose and Nierome were in one time / even
about. iiij. hundred year after Christ / and yet before their time were there
arisen infinite heretics by hole sects / as the Arryans / Domi tians /
Eunomians / vigila^cians / ^lagians with infinite other / which had so swerved
from the truth and wrested the scripture out of frame / y^ it was not possible
for one man / no nor for one man's age to restore it again unto the true
sense Emonge these there were some / which not only feigned a purgatory / but
alsoo dooted so far / that they affirmed that everye man were he never so
vicions should be saved through yt fire and alleged for them the place of Daule.
1. Lorinthiorum. iij. These holy doctoures perceyvinge 1. Lor. 3.
those great erroures / thought it not best by and by to condemnne all things
indifferent lie. But to suffer and dissemble with the less / that they might
wede out the opinions which were most noisome / as the apostles granted unto
the Jews that the gentiles should keep so me of Moses law. Acts. xv. yt they
might the ^ctes. 15.
better come to their purposse to save the Iues with the gentles. For if they
had at the first v^ (...) set off the law / then would the Iues ne uer have
geven any audience unto the apostles S. Iustyue.
And even so. S. Austyne went wyselye to work. First condempninge by the
scripture that er roure which was most no ysome / and wrote on this manner.
Albeit some might be purged through fire / yet not such as y^ apostle
conde^pneth when he says that ye persons which so do shall not possess the
kingedome of heaven. And where they woldehaue stuck unto Paul's text. 1. Cor.
3. and affirm that they should be saved through fi re. S. Austyne a^swered / yt
Paul's text was un derstande of the spiritual fire which is tempta cyon /
affliccyon / tribulacyon etc^. This wrote he in the. 67. 68. of his enchiridio^
to subverte that gross crroure / that al should be saved through the fire of
purgatory. yet in the. 69. he goes a little nere them / and says yt it may
be douted whether there be any such purgatory or not / h^durst not yet openly
condemn it / because he thought that men could not at that time bear it. But
after in his book which he entitled de vanitate huius seculi / there does he
fullye she
^e his mind in these words: Scitote quod cu^ anima a corpore auellitur /
statim aut pro meritis bonis in paradiso collocatur aut pro meritis malis in
inferni tartara precipitatur. That is / wete ye well that when y^ soul is
departed from the body / either is it by and by put in paradyse according to
his good deserts: orels it is thrust hedlinge in to hell for his sins. Here
he ^lene condempneth purgatory. For if this be done by and by as soon as the
soul is departed from the body / then ca^ there be no purgatory. And so
makes. S. Austyne hoell with us. Thin ^e ye that. S. Austyne dissenteth from
his companion. S. Hierome / or from his own Master. S. Ambrose? Nay vere lie.
How be it I will allege their own words / and then judge

Saint Ambrose dissenteth not from. S. Au S. Ambrose /
styne / but does stablish his sentence as fully as is possible. For he writes
in the second chaptre of his book which is called de bono mor it is / on this
manner bringinge in the words of David. Psalm. 39. Ad vena ego sum in terra et
pe regrinus sicut omnes patres mei. Et ideo tanquam peregrinus ad illam
sanctorum communem omnium patriam festinabat. Petens pro huius commorationis
inquinamento remitti si by peccata priusquam discederet de vita.

Qui enim hic non acceperit remissionem peccatorum / illic non erit. Non erit
autem quia ad vitam eternam non potuerit peruenire / quia vi ta eterna remissio
peccatorum est. Ideoqz dicit re^itte mihi vt refrigerer priusqua^ abeam etc^.
that is / I am a stranger and pilgryme in the earth / as all my fathers have
been. And therefore as a pilgryme he hasted unto the come^ country of all
saints / requiringe for the filthiness that he had received in this bodily
mansion / yt his sins might be forgeven him before he departed from this
life. For he that here has not receyved forgiveness of his sins / shall not
be there. He shall not surely be there / for he ca^ not come unto everlastinge
liffe / for everlastinge life ^o the forgevenesse of sins. And therefore he sa
yeth / forgive me that I may be cooled before I depart. Here may you
evid^ntlye perceive that Saint Ambrose knew (...) of purgatory nor of any
forgiveness that should be after this lyffe. But plainly affyrmeth that he
that receyveth not forgevenesse of his sins here (that is in this life) shall
never come in heaven. And for a more vehement affyrmacyon he doubleth his own
words saying / he y^ here has not receyved forgevenesse of his sins / he
shall not be there / he shall not surely be there: hemea neth that he shall
never come to heven which he re has not his remission.

Saint Hieromes mind may sone be gathe S. Hiero^
red by his exposition of the. ix. chaptre of Ecclesya. 9.
ecclesiastes upon this text: the deed have no part in this world / not in
any work that is done under the sonn^. There adds. S. Hierome / that the
deed can add nothing unto that which they have taken with the^ out of this
life fe. For they can another do good not sin / neither can they increase in
virtue or vice. Albe yt (says he) some will contrary this exposicyo^ af
fyrmynge also that we may increase and decrea se after deeth. Here are three
things to be noted First yt the text says / that the deed are not can do no
good / what should they do in purgato rye? And again if they can not increase
in virtue they be like to lie long in purgatory. Par adventure some man would
think^ that they do no good / but only that they suffer good. To yt I a^swere
/ that he yt suffers good / does good. For if a man / should suffer his body
to be burnt for the faith of christ / would you not say that he did a good
dead? and yet does he but suffer. Thyrdlye ye may note that. S. Hierome was
not ignorant that certain (as they which did

Nevertheless I will go further with him. Be it in case that all the doctors
did af firm purgatory / as they do not: what were my lord the nere his
purpose? verelye not one Jot. For the auctoryte of doctoures by my lords own
confession extends no further bu^ is o^lye to be admitted whiles they
confirm their words by scripture or else by someprobable reason For my lord
writes on this manner. Article. 37 the pope has not so allowed y^ hole doctrine
of Rochestre
S. thomas That me^ should believe everye ^oyn te he wrote were true. Neither
has the church so approved either. S. Augustyne or. S. Hierom no nor any other
auctours doctrine / but that in some places we may dissent from them for they
in many places have openly declared them selves to be men / and many times to
ha ve erred. These are my lords own words. Now since the doctors sometime
err / and in cer tayne places are not to be admitted (as he grau^ teth him
silfe) how should we know when to approve them and when to deny them? If w^
should hang on the doctoures auctorite / then should we as well allow y^
untruth as y^ truth since he affirms both. Therefore we must have a judge to
disserne between truth and falsehed And who should that be: the Pope? Nay (...)
lie for he being a man (as well the doctoures were) may err as they did /
and so shall we ever be uncertain. Our judge therefore must not be percyall
flexible nor ignoraunte (and so are all natural me^ excluded) but he must be
inal terable / even serchinge the botome and ground of all thing. who must
that be? verelye the scripture and word of god: which was given by his son /
confirmed and sealed by the holy ghost / and testefyed by miracles and blood
of all martyrs. This word is the judge that must examyne the matter / the
perfeyte touchstone that tries all thing and day that dis^ seth al
iuggelinge mistes. If the doctoures say any thing not dyssonaunte from this
word then is yt to be admitted and holden for truth: But if any of their
doctrine dyscorde from y^ it is to be abhorred and holden a curste.

To this full well agrees. S. Austine which S. Augus^ styne
writes unto. S. Hyerome on this wise: Dear brother / I think that you will
not have your books reputed like unto the works of the prophets and
apostles: for I (the scripture reserved) do read all other men's works on
that manner / that I do not believe them because the auctoure so says / be he
never so well learned and holy / except that he can certefye me by y^ scrip
ture or clear reason that he says true. And even so would I that other men
should read^ my books / as I read theyrs. These are. S. Austyns words. And
thus have I proved both by. Saint Augustyne and also by my lords aw ne words
/ that no man is bound to believe the doctors / except they can be proved
true either by scripture or good reason not repugnaunte to scripture. Therefore
let us se what scripture or good reason my lord brings to approve his
doctors withal For else they can not help him (as we have declared both by.
S. Augustyne and my lords awn^ confession) although they all made with him /
as they do not. First he brings in the sin against the holy ghost. Mat. xii.
And paul. i. Cor. iii. And. 1. Joan. 5. And apo calipsis. 5. which textes I
pass over because I have answered unto them before in the second book /
agenst Master More. Rochestre


THe first reason that my lord has which Luce. 16.
is not before soluted (for as I said y^ rea sons yt are all ready dissolved
will I now over hippe) is this / which he groundeth on diverse scriptures. Of
y^ souls y^ are departed / some a re all ready dampened in hell / and some are
all ready in heaven. And to prove this true he allegeth the parable of the
rych man. Luce. xv.. I am sure, my lord is not so ignorant as to say that a
parable proves any thing. But the right use of a parable is this / to expou^
de an hard text or point that was before tou ched and could not enter in to
every man's capacite. ^yther are all things like which are spoken in a
similitude / neither yet all things true that are touched in a parable: but we
must consider the thing wherefore they be spoken / and apply the^ only to
that they are spoken for / and let the resydue goo: as wyllyam Tindale has well
declared unto you in the parable of wicked (...). This parable is very hard
to be expounded. The cause is this / no man can well espy by the text for
what purposse it was spoken. But this should seem to be the cause / that there
were many of the pharisees and other mul titude which would not believe the
preaching^ of Christ although he confirmed his wor^s with the auctorite of
Moses and the prophets / but they were curious and somedeale fantastical and
therefore would they not believe his words except some apparycyons had been
made un to them that they might have been assured by the^ that were before deed
that his words were true.

Unto such yt is like that he speaks this parable / plainly concludynge that
they should have no such appary^yons of the deed / and also that yt was not
^cessarye: but that they had Moses and the prophets / to whom if they would
g^ue no credence / then should ^hey not (...) leave although one of the deed
should rise agay^ and tell yt the Notwithstondinge let me grant it him / that
some are all ready in hell and some in heaven (which thing he shall never be
able to prove by the scripture / ye and which plainly destroys the
resurrexion and takes away the argu mentes wherewith christ and paul do prove
that we shall rise) yet I say let me grant yt him to se how he will
conclude. what follows on yt Roche^


Neither it is credible (says he) that all which are not cast in to hell
should straight way goo to heaven / therefore must we put a purga torye where
they may be purged.

I answer / All that live are faithful or un Frith
faithful. If he be unfaithful then is he dampened. Joan. ^ii. If he believe
the^ is he not conde^p ned / but is gone from deeth to life. Joan. 3. 5 The
rightwyse man when he dies shall rest in pe^ce. Sapi. iii. And everye
faithful man is right wise before god (as the hole pystle. to the Romans
proves: Ergo then every faithful man shall rest in peace and not be
tormented in the pains of purgatory. And as touching this point where they
rest / I dare be bold to say that they are in the hand of god / and that god
would that we should be ignorau^te where they be / and not to take upon us to
determine the matter.

Parad ve^ture you would inquire of me (since y^ parable says y^ Lazarus
rested in Abraha^s bo some) what Abraha^s bosom is? To y^ would I a^swere y^
Abraha^s bosom were nothing else the^ Abraha^s fayeth: for all we are called
y^ children of Abraham because of his perfeite faith wh ich we ought to follow.
in this faith are many (...) in a manner infinite degrees notwhitsto^di^ge if
it beno greter the^ a (...) sed yt is to say very yet shall yt save us. He
that departs in this faith rests in peace and wayteth for the last day
when god shall give unto his faithful / that is / to his elect (for only are
the elect fay thfull and the faithful elect) the croune of his glory which
he has prepared for them that lo ue him. This croune does paul say that he
shall receive yt in that day. 2. Timo. 4. that is in the day of judgment.
And in the mean cea son god has so provided for us / that they shall wait
vntysl the number of their brothre^ why ch daily suffer and shall suffer for
christ / be hoe lie fulfilled / and so shall they not be made perfeyte with out
us. Nebre. xi. If my lord will understand by Abraham's bosom heaven / I will
not be contencyous / let the christen judge which sentence seems most true.
But this is once a clear case that of this he can prove no purgatory. For the
unfaithful are all re^ dye dampened / and the fayethfull rest in peace / let
him call that what he will / whether to rest in heaven or to rest in their
says until the last
day. For I am sure there is no man so mad as to say / that to rest in peace
should sygnyfle to lie in the pains of purgatory.

^urthermore / this text shall rather make sore agenst him then any thing
with ^ym. For Lazarus / whiles he was lyvinge was not without sin / nor no
man else. 1. Ioh annes. 1. so that no wan as long as he 1. (...). 1.
has breath in his body can say that he is with out sin / for then should
he make. Sa ynt Johan a liar. And yet was not Lazarus carried in to purgatory
to be purged of his sins which were remaining in his body the hour of his
deeth: wherefore I may conclude that there is no such purgatory For god is as
just unto him as unto us / and therefore would he purge him as well as us / and
again he is as merciful unto us as unto him and will as well forgeus us as
him / with out broylinge on the coals in purgatory: for his justice and mercy
are ever one and not alterable. But our perfeyte purgacion is the pure blood
of Christ which wassheth away the sin of the world. And albe it we ever
have the remnauntes and dregs of sin / and rebellion of our members as
long as we have liffe / yet are they hoellye finished in deeth / for of such
efficac^ te is christ's deeth / that it has turned y^ deeth of his faithful
(which was laid upon us as the pain of sin) in to a medicyne agenst sin
which fullye cures it and makes an end of it / as it was well figured in
gol^s that was slain with his own sword.

(...) where as my lord brings for hispur Rochestre
posse Mat. xii. that men shall give accou^p Mat. 12.
tos of everye idle word / I have soluted that be Frith
fore agenst master More / that I think he shall say him silfe that he is
answered. For if men shall give a rekeninge for them on the day of dome (as
the text says) that should rather argue that there were no purgatory wherein
tho se sins should be purged / for if they had been purged before of them /
then should they not give an accoumptes for the^. And if it proved any thing
at all / it should prove that there were a purgatory after domesdaye which no
man wa^ ever so folish as to grant.

But the true understanding of this text is this. There are two kinds of men
one faith full / the other unfaithful. The faithful through Faithful
their faith in christ's blood are all ready fullye purged in their heart /
and their rebellious m^res through deeth are hoellye subdued. The se men shall
give no rekeninge neither of idle word nor evell deed. For all their sins
are co vered of Christ / and his blood shall give the hoell accoumptes for
them. The unfaithful unto Unfaithful
their utter confusion shall have the book of their conscience opened and there
shall be preseu ted before them al their evell dendes words and thoughts. And
these are they (that christ speaks off) which shall give this great accoumpt^
Note also that in the text they are called men / which word in scripture is
ever Men
for the most part taken in y^ worst sense / and signifies wyked men /
fleshlye men / and men that follow their own lu stes and appetites

^hen confirms he purgatory out of the Rochestre
(...). Psalm which says / we have gon^ through fire ad water and thou have
brought (...) Psalm. 66.
in to colenesse I am sure you have not forgote^ Frith
that Master More allegeth the prophet zach^ zachari. 9.
rye in the. ix. and affirms that there is no wa^ ter in purgatory. It were
hard to make the^ two agree / for when men ground them on a ly^ then for the
most part their tales and proba^ ons are contrary and will not well ^onde
(...) gither. Nevertheless in one point they ag^ full well / that is / both
of them say untruly: (...) neither another text serves any whitte for p^
^atorye. And as concerning the place of zacharye: it is suffecie^tlye declared
whath it means. And now will I also declare you the vnder^ dinge of this
text / and first that it can not serve for purgatory I vesech you that have
the psalter once to rea^ the psalm and I think you shall wondre at their
dotinge dreams and ignorance which allege this text for purgatory. The
text^ of the psalm is this / thou have brought us in to a straight and laded
our backs with trouble or (...). Thou have set men upon our heedes / we
hau^ gone through fire and water and thou have led us out agay ne in to a
place of refreshinge. The textes befo re and after in the same psalm will not
suff^ that this place should be understand of purga torye. For the text
immediatlye before says / thou have set men upon our heedes: But y^
thefest defendars of purgatory (and even Ma stre More him silfe) say that
they are not men / but devels which torment the souls in purgatory /
notwithstanding More and
my lord of Rochestre Rochestre (...).
(good man) affirms that they are angels which tourment the souls there:
but never man dooted so far^re as to say that men tourment the souls in
purgatory / wherefore I may conclude that his text is not meant of purgatory
/ but that the prophet meant that men ran over the children off Israhell and
subdued them / and wrapped them in extreme troubles which in the scripture are
signified by fire and water. Besides yt y^ textes folowinge will not admit yt
this should be vnder^de of purgatory, for it follows immediatlye / I will
e^tre in to thy housse with burntofferinges / I shall of fre u^toy^ fat
sacrifices with y^ reke of wethers I shall burn to the oxen and gotes. Now is
there no man so mad as to think that y^ souls of purgatory should offer
unto god any such sacrifices. So that the text is plainly un derstonde of the
children of Israel which through the lord were delivered from their affliccions
and enemies and then offered their loyal sacrifices of praise and thanks to
y^ lord their shil de and proteccion.

NOw flies my lord unto the church and sa Rochestre
yeth / that because the church has affirmed it we must needs believe it / for
the church ca^ not err. As thouchinge this point I will refer Frith
you unto a work that wyllyam Tinda^ has written agenst. M. More / wherein ye
shall well perceyve what the church of Christ is / and that his church never
determed any such thing. But that it is the sinagoge of Satan yt makes
articles of y^ faith and binds men's consciences further then the scripture
will.

THen wexeth his lordeshippe somewhat hate Rochestre
against Marten Luther / Because he would y^ no man should be comp^led to believe
purgatory. For my lord says that it is profitable and well done to compel
men to believe such things whether they will or will not. And to sta blish his
opinion he plucketh out a word of y^ parable of luke. xiiij. that a certain man
made a Lucc. 14
great souper / and said unto his servauntes / goo forth quyclye in (...) the
ways and compel ^em to enter in.

^erelye there Christ meant no another thing Frith.
/ but that his apostles should goo forth in to all the world and preach his
word unto all na cyons / openinge unto them the miserable state and cond^n
that they be in / and again what mercy god has showed the^ in his son
christ. This would Christ that his apostles should expound and lay out so
evidentlye by reasons / scriptures and miracles unto the gentiles / yt they
should even by their manifest persuasions be compelled to grant unto them that
he was christ / and to take upon the^ the faith that is in christ One this
manner did Christ compel y^ saducees to grant the resurreccion. Matthei.
xxij. And by these means compelled he the Pharis^s to grant in their
consciences that he did his miracles with the power of god / and yet astir
ward of very hate knowinge in their hearts the contrary / they said that he
did them by the po were of the dev^ll. Matthei. xij. But to say that Christ
would have his disciples to compel men with presonme^t / feters / (...) ginge
/ sword and fie re is very false and far from the ^enesse of a christen
spirit / although my lord approve it ne ver so much. For Christ did forbid
his disciples such tyranny / (...) and rebuked them because they would have
desired that fire should descend from heaven to consume the Samaritanes which
would not receive Christ Luke. ix. But he co^ maunded them that if men would
not receyve their doctrine / they should depart from thence and sprincle of
the dust of their fet^ to be a testimonye agenst the unfaithful that they had
been there and preached unto them the word of Luc^. 9.
liffe: But with violence will god have no man compelled unto his law. Paul
also testifyeth. ij. Corin. 1. that he had not rule over the Corinthians as
touching their faith. By our faith we stand in the lord / and by o^re
infidelite we fall from him. As no man can search the heart but only god / so
can no man judge or order ou (...) faith but only god through his holy sprete^

(...) / faith is a gift of god / which he destributeth at his own pleasure.
1. Cor. ^ij. If he give it not this day / he may give it to 1. Cor. 12
morrow. And if thou perceyve by any exterior work that they neyboure have it
not / enstructe him with gods word and pray god to give him grace to
believe: and that is rather a point of a christen man then to compel a man by
deeth or exterior violence.

Hynallye / what does thy compulsion and violence? Uerelye nothing but make a
starcke hypocrite. For no man can compel the heart to believe a thing /
except it se evidence and sufficient proof. I have hard tell of a boy which
was present at his fathers burninge for his bele ue / and as soon as the
officers had espied ye boy they said to each other / Let us take him and
examine him also / parad ve^ture we shall find him as great an heretic as
his father. Uvhen the boy saw that his father was deed / and that y^
catchpolles began to snatch at him. he was sore dismayed and thought that he
should dye to. And when one of them apposed him askinge him how he beleved / he
answered: Master / I believe even as it pleases you. Even so by tourmen tes and
craftye handlinge a man may be compel^ed to say that he beleveth the thing
which he neither thinks nor yet can believe. For a man's faith is not in his
own power. But how does god accept this thing / to say that I believe that
which in deed I believe not? Uere lie he utterly co^de^pneth it whether the
opinion be true or false. For if the opinion be true (as by example that the
faith in Christ's blood iustefyeth me before god) and I confess it before all
the bysshopes in engloude with my mouth and believe it not with mine heart /
then am I nothing the better (for I should have no part of Christ's blood)
but I am much the worse. For first god condempneth me / which judges me after
mine heart / and also mine own heart conde^pneth me because I have openly
graun tid that mine heart deuyeth.

And contrary wise / if I should believe this fullye in inyne heart / ad yet
for fear of persecu tion should deny it when I were examined open lie of my
faith / then shall I be condemned of god (except I repent) and also mine own
har te shall be a witness to condemn me. And so is it ver^e noisome and
ungodly to be compelled unto any thing / for god ever sercheth the heart
which can not be compelled.

BUt my lord obiecteth writing upon the Eochestre
xvii^. article saying: If a man take away purgatory / for what intent shall
we need any Pardons
pardons? As long (says he) as no man regar ded purgatory / there was no
man that sought any pardon / for all the estimacyon of pardons hangs thereof /
so that we shall have no need of them / if there be no purgatory.

Uerelye I care not though I grant him Frith.
that to. And I think y^ Monye was the mother of them both. For out of y^
scripture shall he be able to prove neither another.

But ma^mon is a great god / even of power enough to inve^t such knackes / ye
and to make them articles of the faith / and to ^urne those that can not beleve
the^. And it was a preatye practice to make such points articles of the faith
/ for after yt our holy fathers had geven up prea chinge and would take no
more pains / neither ser ve their brothren any more / then set they up
such articles of the faith as should bring in mo nigh to vppholde their astate
with all. And he yt would not believe them / rydde him out of y^ way for fear
of disclosinge their iugglinge / for h^ that douteth of pardons and purgatory
/ he plu^ keth our holy father by the beerde.

NOtwithstoudinge my lord confirms both (...)
pardons and purgatory / by the text y^ christ spoke unto Peter Mat. xvj. To
the will I ge ue the hayes of the kingdom of heaven / and what so (...) thou
bindest v^on the earth it shall be bou^ de i^ h^ade^ / and what so ever thou
loosest on y^ erthit shall be loosed (...) heaven. But these words (says my
lord) had been spoken in vain if h^ could not give pardons and loose men out
of purgato^ye. etc.

^s touching the kayes / albe it they hau^ (...).
often times been declared and in a manner in everye treatise yt has been put
forth in the english tongue yet will I sum what show my mind it^ them. There
is but one kaye of heaven which Christ calls the kaye of knowiege Luc. xj.
And this kaye is the word of god. Christ rebuked y^ (...) ^u. (...)
(...) for taking away this kaye from the people / for they with their
tradicyons / and false exposicyons had fullye excluded the kaye of knowledge
which is the word of god and had clean s^utte v^ y^ scripture as ours have
done now adays. It is also called ye kaye of david which shuts and no man
openath / ope^eth and no man ^hutteth Apo. iij. And because of these two
effects Apo. 3.
which it works (for it both shuts and open neth) has it the dominacio^ of
kayes / and yet (as I said) in deed it is but one / which is the word of god.
This kaye or kayes (now call it as you will since you know what it means)
Christ de lyvered unto Peter and unto his other apostles a like / which you
shall easelye perceave if you mark where and when they were geven. For mat
Mat. 16.
xvj. they were only promised and not yet geven / for Christ said I will give
the the kayes / and not I give the. But after he was risen from deeth then
performed he his promise and gave ye kayes to all indifferentlye as thou
maistse Johan. xx. Johan. 20
and luke in the. xxiiij. expounds it / yt he opened Luc. 24.
their wits to understand the scripture yt repentance and forgiveness
might be preached. etc^. Therefore it is the word yt binds and loses through
the preachinge of it. For when thou tellest them their vices and iniquityes
co^demnige the^ by the law / then bindest thou them by ye word of god / and
when thou preachest mercy in Christ unto all yt repent / then do thou loose
them by the word of god. Therefore he y^ preaches not the word of god / can
neither bind nor loose /
no / though he call him silfe pope. And contrary wise / he yt preaches his
word he binds and loo seth even as well as Peter and Paul / although he be
called but Sir Ihon of the country. And consequentlye / to say that he pope
can deliver any soul out of purgatory (if there were one) is but a vain lie
/ except he can prove that he goes down unto them and preach unto them the
word of god (which is the salt that must ceason them and kaye y^ must let
them out) for other losinge is tho^ noue. And likwyse / to say y^ the (...)
can give any pardon to redeem sins / except he preach me that Christ's
blood has perdoned me / is even like vanite.

(...) thinks also that he wadeth to deep to descend to purgatory by this
text. For the ^at. 16.
text says / that whate so ever he binds on earth shall be bound in heaven
and what so ever he loses on earth. etc^. But now they grant the^ selves that
purgatory is not on earth / but the third place in hell: And therefore it
passes his bonds to stretch his hand to purgatory: and so this text can not
serve him.

NOt withstondinge my lord is not content Rochestre
to give him this power only / but he has so far waded in the popes power /
that he has granted him full auctorite to delyver all men from hell (if they
be notdampned all ready) for (says he) who so ever have committed a capitale
crime has ther^ deserved dampnacyon / and yet may the pope delyver him both
from the crime and also from the pain due unto it / ^ud he affer^eth that.
iij. times in the. xxj. article for fear of forgettinge.

Upon this point will I a little reason with (...)
my lord / and so will I make an end. If the pope may delyver any man from
the crime that (...) has committed and also from the pain due unto it / as
you affirm / then may he by the same auctorite delyver. xx. an hundred / a
thousan (...) / ye and all the world: for I am sure you can show me no reason
why he may delyver some and not all. If he can do it / then let him veliver
^erye man that is in the point of deeth both from the crime and from the pain
/ and so shall never man more neither enter in to hell nor yet in to
purgatory: which were the best deed and most charitablest that ever he did /
ye and this ought he to do (if he could) although it should ^ost him his own
life and soul thereto (as Mo ses and Paul give him ensample) but yet there
Exodi. 32.
is no ieoperdye of neither another. Now if he Romans 9
ca^ do it (as you say) and will not / then is he the most wretched and cruel
tyraunte that ever lyved / even the very son of perditio and worthy to be
dampened in an hundred thousand helles. For if he have received such power of
god that he may save all men and yet will not / but suffer so many to be
dampened / I report me un to your selves what he is worthy to have?

Now if any man would solute this reason and say that he may do it / but that
it is not mete for him to do it / because yt by their pains gods justice
may be satisfied: I say that this their evasion is nothing worth / neither
yet (...) I imagyne any way wherbye they may have any appearance to escape.
For my lord says him silfe that the pope must pacefye gods justice for
everye soul that he delyvereth from pur gatorye: and therefore has he imagyned
that the pope has in his hand the merits of Christ's passion which he may
apply at his pleasure where he will. And also he says that the merits of
Christ's passion are sufficient to redeem all the sins in the world. Now
since these merits on their part are sufficient to sati^ye the justice of god
and (...) the hoell world / and also that the pope has them in his hand to
distribute at his pleasure: then lacks there
no more but even the popes distribucyon (...) the salvation of the hoell
world. For he (...) gods wrath and satisfye his justice (says my lord) by
^lyinge these merits to them that ^acke good works. And so if yt pope will /
gods justice may be fullye satisfye^ and the hoell world saved. Now if he
may so ius^ lie and (...) save the hoell world (cherite al so movinge him
unto it) and yet will not apply these merits so frutefullye / then is the
fault (...) lie his / and he the son of perdicyon and (...) more pain then
can be imagined. And (...) not the (...) improved but ^och more (...) / and as
I think inevitable.

Behold I pray you whother my lord (...) Rochestre has brought our holy
father (...) a vauncynge his power in (...) / even in to y^ (...) of hell which
((...) my lord say (...) it is impossible for him to avoyde. But (...) unto
him even as it does (...) such pride reigns: for wha^ they are (...) / then
fall they down hedlinge unto (...) utter confusion and ruin.

If any (...) feale him (...) greaved and not yet fullye satisfied in this
(...) let him write his mind / and by gods grace I shall make him answer
/ and that with speed.

Pray Christen reader yt the word of god man increase.
Amen.
