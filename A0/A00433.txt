Iordes seller that was very proud and presumtyouse and said that there was no
man that culde deseyue him or pass him in wisdom and there was none of all
the lords that loved him Than thought howleglas in his mind how he might
deseyue him Tha^ upon a time took Howleglas. ij. pottes one of water and the
other empty and he hyd the empty pot that noma^ saw it and came to the seller
and gave the wine dramer the empty pot and bad him fill the pot with wine and
so he did and wha^ it was full he browght it up to Howleglas and than he looked
a side and in ye mean while howleglas set the pot of water in the pot or wynes
place and hyd the pot of wine and than ashyd he the drawer what he should pay
and the drawer said. x. wytten that said howleglas the wine is to dear for me /
For I have but viij. wytten Than was the wine drawer angerye and said will ye
set another price on ye wine than ye lords have set Than said howleglas I have
no more money and I shall nath^^ue it so tha^ take your wine again for I knew
it not before / Than was the wine deawer very angery and took the ^^ot with the
water and bare it down into the seller and pored out the water into the
vessel and went it had been ye wine and came and gave Howleglas the pot and said

tha^ was Howleglas browght before the Iuges and they gave sentence that he
should be hanged and on the morrow was he browght unto the galowes for to be

and there were gathered many of ye cowne to se Howleglas suffer death / but the
lords of Iubeke were soryefor him for some went that he culde socery or
wytchecrafre that he therewith simlde be delivered and as he was led toward the
galowse he lay all still as thowght he had been all deed and when he came under
the galowes than desired he to speak with the lords and when the lords were cum
he fell upon his knes and prayed them that they would grant him a boue and
the lords said that should be his life that he would ask. And than said How
leglas it shall not be my life not money nor it should not cost them one
pennye of cost And all ye lords of Iubeke went to ye other side of the
galowes and took acounsayll and they repeted his words and than agreed to

kiss my ats when that I am hanged upon the galowes by the space of.iij. days
long with his mowth in the morning fasting and the Gorowghe master first

that that was a unmannerly bone for to be asked And then said howl glass to the
lords of Iubeke I know the coun seyll of Iubeke so sure of their promise that
they would hold that they have promised both with hand and mowthe Then
wentethe lords ayene to counsayll and than said the oon to the other this

no land wheresoever he came.
O^ on a time ye Seniatours of Ro^^ h^^ great dyscorde among them self which

browgh kings of Romans and emperor of Rome but there were many other that
looked for it So when he was made he lay. vi. wekes long before yt town of
Frankeforde (...) bydynge there for a^ other lords to tourment where was a
great company assembled And this herynge. Howleglas thowght in his mind to goo
thither and so he and for there he thowght to get some gyfre and it were no more
but the emperors silver harnepse And as Howleglas passed be frankeford he met
with the Bishop of Taer and by cause that he was clothed auenturelye he asked
him what he was and Howleglas answered I am a spectacle maker cum out of
Grabant and I ca^ find no work than said the bishop m^ thy^ke that your
craft should be better daily for ye people the longer the syue ye less sight
they have therefore your craft should be better daily / and than said Howleglas
to the bishop my lord ye say trewthe but there is oon thing that destroys
our craft and if that ye will not take no despleasure I shall show it to you
/ and than the bishop bad him say what he would and than said he this dell^^
wyes our craft yt such ^re Than said the merchaunte all angerly god d^^ue it
under nethe the galows^ / and as he was a little ferther he spyed a Galowes and
thither dreued he the wagen under nethe ye galowes / and when it was under nethe
he made the wagen to stand (...) untied the horse Than say^^ the merchan^

dreme his sword and would have (...) him but the pryste would not suffer him /
and th^^ made he fast ye horse a geyne and he than dre^^^ out the journey And
when the merchant was come home his wife asked how he fared and how he lyked
his man he answered so so than he called Howleglas and bad him tarry there yt
night and eat his belly full and in the mo^nynge depart fro thense for he
said that he was but a begyler and a deseyuer where so ever he we^t^ Than
said Howleglas good master yt shall I do and than a rose Howleglas erly in
the mor nynge and as he was up the merchaunte said eat and drink your bellye
full and ryd ye house of you yt I find ye nathere when that I come again for
I must goo to church for and I find you here I shall beat you yt ye shall

to him and when that the merchaunce was at church than began he for to ryd all
the howseholde stuff out of the house and bare it into the street then word
came to his master to the church that all his howseholde stuff stood in ye
street Than came ye merchau^te home and saw that it was Howleglas yt had borne
out all his stuff and asked him why he did so and Howleglas said I do as ye
bad me for ye bad me yt I should ryd your house and so I have of all your
stuff that ye have / than said the merchaunte to Howleglas depart fro hense
and cum no more here with ye delues name for here is no body that thanks the

said to carry in his gere again that Howleglas had borne out.

How Howleglas was bid for a geste.
IN Iune^ borowgh dwelled a flewte maker that knew well land roners and knew
also much decepte And on a time came he to ye ynne where Howleglas was and bad
him to mo^owe at none cumere with me than thanked Howleglas him and said that
he would and than departed the flewte maker home and on the morrow at none went
Howleglas to the pype makers house and when he came there he fu^de all the doors
shyt and than walked he round a boute the house till none was paste and then
knew he well that he was deseyued and returned home a gain and on the
morning as he walked in the marker he spyed the pype maker and than went he to
him and thanked him for his dinner and said when ye bid a body shytte ye all
your doors / and the pype maker said I bad you cum eat but you culde not cum
in for I had shyt ye doors and than he lawhed and said goo to my house a fore
and I shall cum after to dinner for ye shall find there both roste and sodde
and than departed Howleglas to the pype maker house there he found altrewe as
the pype maker told him and than said he to the pype makers wife that she
should goo as fast as she culde to her hushande and said yt he had a great
sturgyn given him and said that he would turn the spytte till that she tam
home a gayn the woman said good Howleglas keep ye house till that I come a yeen
and let no body in than departed the woman with her maid toward her husband
as fast as she culde and met with him by the way and when he saw her he asked
her wether she went so fast and she said to help him for she said that
Howleglas had told to her that ye had a sturgen given you and said that ye
bad that we should cum and help you for it was so great that ye were not able
to bear it / than was the man angery and said know ye not well that Howleglas
is such a mocker and a desse^^er than went he home with his wife and when he
came home he knocked at the door and Howleglas said let be your knocking for
the hooste has charged me that I shall not let no geste in till dinner be done
for the^ she said that she would be here than said he yt is truth but she meant
not so and tha^ went he to his nayghbours and tared there to Howleglas had
dyned and when that Howleglas had dyned and made good there than opened he the
door and than the pypemaker came in with all his folk And when he was wtin he
said to Howleglas that it was no honest for a geste to shyt his hoostayse out
of the doors and in this manner served he his Hooste and the hoostayse.

with a good will and than took Howleglas ye shown and put in the little
shown into ye great shown and sowed them both to gyther as his master had
bid him and at the last that had sp^ed his master and said ye be a good
servant for ye do all thing as men bid you / Than an^^^tred Howleglas and
said / they that do as they be bid they be wordy to have thank than said the
master ye do after my saying and not after my meaning for I mente that
first ye s^^tide have sowed a little pair and after a great payer and the
master was hastey and took him other ledder and said cut me all this ledder
upon o^n last and the master thought no more of the falsenes of Howleglas
depa^^^^^ his ^hamber and when he was come (...) remne^bered he what he had
sapd to (...) th^n went he as fast as he cu^^ (...) ^hoppe whe^^ as Howleglas
(...) three Howleglas had cut all (...) ly^ ^^^il^ (...) all for the ^efte for

tha^ answered Howleglas ye bad me cut all upon on last than answered ye show
maker if that I should keep you long you wol make me so pore that I must
needs goo a beggynge but now give me money for myledder that thou haste
marred me and depart fro hense Than answered Howleglas to the show maker the
hyde of a bull will make two hydes and with those words arose he and said in
this house have I been / but I will not come here again and so departed he fro
thense.

How Howleglas sold courdes for fat.
(...) Howleglas had destroyed much (...) the showemakers wherefore the (...)
^^s uery sorry and that herynge (...) ^^ned again to the town and (...) ^^r
and told him that he had a (...) ^^lde his master that he shul^^ (...) ^^e
for to restore him part of (...) ^^d done to him before in his (...)
showemaker said if it be (...) ^^me have it before a another (...) Howleglas
with a good will (...) (...) ^^tud then went Howleglas (...) and made
hym^yll.xij. ^^relles with towedes for a little money and tha^ took he a
little talowe and put in the barelles.iiij. inches thycke as thowghe it had
been all together greece and closed it so close that it should not stynke for it
was in the winter when there was a great froste that the durte was fast frosen
to the barell and the other.vi. barelles he filled with other talowe or fat
more thycker than the other.vi. were for they were the example of his
merchau^dyse And when that he had dressed all ye barelles he sense for his
master the showemaker and asked him if that he would cum se ye merchaundyse
and he said he would / than with in a while came ye showemaker to Howleglas and
when he was come there Howleglas made ye heddes of ye best Barelles to be
broken up when ye cordeenr saw the Barelles they lycked him very well and tha^
Howleglas asked him howethe Barelles pleased him and he answered very well and
than asked he the price and than answered Howleglas ye shall ^^ue me no more
than.xxiiij. guyld^r^.xij. in ho^de and the other xij. at the years end And
than was the showemaker content and thowght no decente and gave to him the.xij.
gu^ld^r^ in hand and he reserved the money and departed and was glad and ye
cordener was glad of the bargayne and thowght that the forsayde harm that he
had done him should be restored / and than he h^^red many fellows to melte the
talowe and browght one barell by the fire and when the durte began for to wexe
whore than began it to smell than said ye one to ye other Iwene some of us
has beshytyn their breche and than came the master and bad them make clean
their shown for one of you has trod in a courde and they looked all a boute
but they found nothing. And than should they have put one of yt barelles in
the cauderne than saw they well that it was the barell that stanke for it was
full of turdes / And chan they left their work and went for to seek Howleglas
but he was gone and so the showemaker must suffer the last loss with the
fyeste.

ON a time served Howleglas a tailor and the tailor asked him if that he culde
sow well and close that no man cause the seem / and than said Howleglas yea

and fe^e And when that he had sowed it together than set he it upon the table
with stan^^ Than in the morning arose his master (...) came down and when he
saw the wolf s^^^dynge upon the table he was a frayde and (...) him what he
had done / And he said ma^^^^^ I have made a wolf as ye bad me / than say^^
the master meant that ye should have made up (...) russet gown for a husbands
man gown ^^ called here a wolf Than answered Howleglas (...) that I had

after watched the master so much he must needs goo sleep and there was a
cote reddye made but it lacked the sleues than ye master took the cote and the
sleues and gave them to Howleglas and bad him yt he should cast on the sleues
and he said he would than went his master to bed and than took Howleglas ye
cote and honge it on a balke and set on every side a candell and stood up and
cast the sleues at the Cote all the night long and than a rose the the tailor
