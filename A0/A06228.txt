FOrasmuch as diverse parcels of Plate of her Majesty's, and of other persons of
honor and credit, have of late years been stolen, and her Highness Arms or
honorable Eschochions, and the Eschochions of others, owners, therevppon being
engraven, have been defaced and blemished: and many Jewels, Chains, and
Bracelets, and such like things of Gold and Pearl, have been imbezelled
from diverse honorable persons and others. And for that within this City and
the Liberties of the same, there be very many Burgularies, Robberies, and
Fellonies, daily committed and done, many vile and notable Coozenages and
deceites practiced and put in ure, and many houses also infected with the
Plague, by reason that diverse persons, called Retayling Broggers, Brokers or
Hucksters, and others, such as use to buy old Apparel, Householdstuffe,
Bedding, Books, Ends, and Remnants of Silks and Veluets, or of Linen and
Woollen cloth, or such like, to sell again, inhabiting within the same City
and the Liberties thereof: under pretense of lawful and iusticiable
contracting, do often, very secretly for dishonest lucre, and that most
ordinarily, upon the Sabbath days, Festival days, and other Holy days,
whereon no markets ought to be kept, nor bargains, contractes, or sales to
be made, receive, buy, and take to pawn, at the hands of base, shifting, and
suspected persons, for very low prices, or small soms of money, diverse Plate,
Jewels, Goods, Wares, Merchandises, Apparel, Books, and Bedding, Remnantes
and Ends of Silks, Veluets, and of Linen and Woollen cloth, and other such
like things, whereof the greatest part are stolen, some part gotten from the
owners by Coozenage and slight, and some newly brought out of houses infected
with the Plague, taking thereof bills of sale. And the same do presently
sell again, and transact sometimes to persons unknown, sometimes to French
and Dutch Brokers, who secretly convey and make transportation thereof beyond
the Seas, so that the right proprietors and true owners, by color of such
pretended sales and secret transportation, are not only frustrated and
deprived of all ordinary means for recovery or restitution of their said
goods, but also the fellons and malefactors, are thereby for the most part
encouraged and their offenses cloaked and concealed. For due reformation
whereof be it enacted by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in this Common
Council assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from henceforth,
no Retaylinge Brogger, Broker, or Huckster, nor any other person or persons
whatsoever, within this City or the Liberties thereof, shall upon any
Sabbath day, Festival day, or other Holy day, being not open market days,
receive, buy, or take to pawn, or sell any Plate, Jewels, Goods, Wares,
Merchandises, Householdstuffe, Apparel, Books, Bedding, or any Ends or
Remnantes of Silks, Veluets, or of Linen, or Woollen cloth, or any such like
thing. And that for ever hereafter there shall be kept and written within this
City and Liberties thereof, true and perfect Register books, by four such
honest and sufficient persons, being Freemen of this City, as from time to
time, by the Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the said City, shall be to
that purpose nominated appointed and sworn, and at such certain places, as by
the same Court shall be likewise appointed, Wherein they shall truly and
particularly enter, as well the names and surnames of every such Retayling
Brogger, Broker, and Huckster, and of every other person, with the place of his

true, plain, and particular note, and certain description of all and every
such thing or things, so delivered, sold, or laid to Pawn, to any such
Retayling Broggar, Broker, or Huckster, or to any other person or persons, with
