(...) Nor slack at this bargyn
Mary here he co^myth I have him aspyde
No more wordis stand thou a side
For it is he plain
My frynde where about goist thou all day cor. B

Mary sir I came heder to a say
whedyr these folk had been here
And yet they be not come
So help me god and holy dome
Of that I have much marvel / that they tar
Mary go thy way / and wit where they will or cor. B

ye god a vow shall I so
ye mary so I say cor. B

yet in that point as semyth me
ye do not according to your degree
I pray the tell me why cor. B

Mary it would be com them well I now
To be here a fore and to wait upon you
And not you to tarry
For their laysyr and abide them here
As it were one that were led by the ear
For that I defy
By this mean you should be their druge
I tell you trought I
And yet the worst that greueth me
Is that your adversary should in you se
So notable A folly
Therefore witdraw you for a seasone
By saint Johan thou say but reasone cor. B

ye do so hardely
And when the time drawith upon
That they be com euerychone
And all thing ready
Than shall I come straight a way
^or to feche you without delay
Be it so hardely
But one thing while I think there one
Remember this when I am gone
yef hit happon so
That lucres come in first alone
Go in hand with her anon
How so ever thou do
For to feel her mind toward me
And by all meanis possible to be
In duce her there unto
Than some to^^^ you must give me
For ellis she will not believe me
That I came from you
Mary that is even wisely spoken
Command me to her by the same token
She knowyth it well I now
That as she and I walkyde onis to gedyr
In her garden hedyr and thedyr
There happonde a strange case
For at the last we did se
Abyrd sittynge on a holow tree
An ash I trow it was
Anon she prayde me for to assay
if I could start the bird a way
And did ye so / alas alas
why the devil say thou so
By collis bonis for it was a kocko
And men say among
He that throwyth stone ar stycke
At such abyrde he is lycke
(...) that birds song
what the devil recke I therefore cor.

Here what I say to the ever more
And mark thine erand well
Sir I had no stone to throw with all
And therefore she took me her must ball
And thus it befell
I kyst it as straight as any pole
So that it lyghtyde even in the hole
Of the holow ash
Now can thou remember all this
By god I would be loath to do amys B

For some time I am full rash
ye say that ye kyst it even in the hole
Of the holow ash as strayte as apole
Said ye not so
yes. cor. B

well then let me a lone
As for this erande it shall be done
As soon as ye be go
Fare well then I leave the here cor.

And reme^byr well all this gere
How so ever thou do Et exeat corn^
yes hardely this erande shall be spoken B

But how say you syrs by this tokene
Is it not a quaynt thing
I went he hade been a said man
But I se well he is amade man
