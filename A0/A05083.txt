Here begynnethe the Lantern of light.

Take here of our gracious lord god this little treatice that here is offered /
called the Lantern of light containing. xiij. chapyters.
First a Prologe.
GOd that is good him self / fair in his Angels marvelous in his saints /
merciful upon sinners / have mercy on us now and ever / and give us grace to
hold ye way of trought in these days of great tribulacyon for now many that
seemed to be stable in virtue fallen from their holy purpose dreding loss and
bodily pain: Mat. 24. Quoniam habundauit iniquitas refrigescit caritas
multorum.
as Christ said That thabu^dau^ce of wyckednes shall cool the charity of many
/ for Satan has now destroyed this world by his leuetenaunt Antechryst /
that men be borne about in diverse doubts as waves of the sea / wredchydly
divided in diverse opinions one against another. But saint Paul did set one
accord among the chisten people saying / there is but one Lord that all men
should love and dred / one faith that all men should keep and believe with out
varyenge / Ephe. 4. Vnus dn^s: vna fides and vnum baptisma. etc.
and one Baptyme that all men should have and steadfastly hold without
defouling. Alas how is this unity broken that men unruled walken after their
lusts as bestes in ye corn: truly the wicked man that Christ spoke of has
done this deed for he has sown faves and cokle upon the sede of god. Math.
13. Inimicus homo super seminauit zi zannia.
This wicked enemy is Antechriste / that cloutyth his laws as rotten Rags
to the clean cloth of Christ's gospel. And waketh in malice as Judas child /
why for Simon slepith and takes non head. O thou wicked man is there any
othere man that may save soulles than Jesus Christ / god said by the mouth of
Moses I shall smite / and I shall hele and there is none that can deliver or
rydde from my hand / Apocalipsis. 1.
who has the keys of David to open heaven gates / and none othere closyth /
to close / and then none othere opens / sayncte John says holy and true
Christ has the keye of David that opens / which castith down / and than
no man reyseth / who reyseth and than no man castyth down. Job says / when
the Lord god has dystroyed there may none other build / Job.
and when the Lord god castyth in prison there may none other deliver or quyte
him of his bonds. And therefore in the virtue of this name Jesus / stands al
man's salvation / as it is written in thactes of thaposteles. Actuu^. 4.
seynct Peter said. There is none othere name under heaven given / but this
name Jesus / whereof we may saved be / for alonely in the virtue of this name
Jesus is the remyssyon of sins / as it is written / Luce.xxiiij. It behooved to
be preached among the people / penance and remission of sins in the name of
Jesus art thou not then a wicked man / a folyshe-herde / a cruel best / the
son of perdicion And Antechrist him self that pretendest in the / and in thy
members / to bless and to curse to bind and to unbind besides this name
Jesus / people without no^bre following the and thy divided laws ben divided from
Christ Ihu^ / and go with the blyndefolde into hell for evermore and this is
great sorrow / so ferforth that Christ makes lame^tacyon and mournyng there
upon saying / Iohi^s. v. Tu es qui ve^turns est an alium ex pectamus.
I have come in the name of my father and ye have not taken me when another
shall come in his own name him shall ye take / and this is Antechryste. And
seyncte John^ Crisostome / upon these words of the gospel / Mathei. xxj.
Lucerna pe dibz meis verbum tull domine.
For who that will not receive Christ in pain of sin he is compelled and
constrained to receive Antechrist / and therefore in this time of tribulacion
and hydeous darkness / let us seek the Lantern of light whereof the prophet
spekith. Lord thy word is a Lantern to my fete / Neque verba neque malagina
sa nauit illos / sed omnipotens sermo tuus qui sanat omnia.
for as fer as ye light of this La^terne shyneth / so far darkness of syn and
clouds of te^ptacyon of the fend vanyssheth away and may not abide. And
evermore when this Lantern lighteneth into an heart / it purgyth it and
cle^sith it from corrupcion / it swagyth and healyth gostely sores / as the
wysema^ says / that nether herb nor plaster has heled them / but Lord thy
mighty word that heleth al things. For truly Lord when thou dyed upon ye
cross thou dydest put in thy word the spryt of life / Verba que ego locutus
sum spu^s et vita smit.
and gave to it power of quickenyng by thine own precious blood / as thou
said thy self. Io. vj. The words that I spoke to you / been spryte and life.
etc.

A peticion of thauctor.
Iacobi. 2. Multu^ valet deprecatio iusti assidua.
Dear Brother in Christ help me with your prayer to almighty god: for seinct
James says The busy prayer of a right wise man is much worth. Ye have
desyered me to take this travail upon me / which is full chargeous to me /
but as toward our sweet Lord god nothing is impossyble as Christ said and
in this faith. Math. 19. Marci. 10. Luce. 18. Isaye. 18. Deus ipse ola opera
operat in nobis.
Ysaye said. The Lord god him self wyrcheth all our works in us / fail we
not then god in good leui^g. And he may not fail to give us such wysdom / as
is needful to us and to tempre our tongue / and give us true organ / and ready
speech / in edefyeng of our neighbor / for without the help of ye spirit of
god our labor were but lost / as Christ said / yt it was not we yt coulde^
speak profitably / but the spirit of the father yt speaks in us / for
thapostels and other holy me^ / Math. 18. Non enim vos estis qui loquimini sed
spu^s pri^s vestri quiloquitur in vobis.
that trauayled in dedly letters / meked the^ selfs as simple ydiottes: as
Hierom said / that prechers unlearned been sent for to preche / yt the faith of
the true beleuers should be trowed to be brought in (not by man's virtue) but
by ye spech and doctrine of god. And saint Austen writing unto Simplician
says. what suffren we / what here we / unlearned me^ arisen and catch heaven.
And we with our clergi ben dre^ched in hell. And seinct Gregory in his Moralles
affirmith this sentence and says. Right as trough incarnate / that is Christ
in manhede chosith simple poor ydiottes to his prechynge so agaynwarde
Antechriste is for to chase stourdy and doble men having the wysdom of this
world for to preche his falsehede. Have we then full faith in our lord Jesus
with perfyte living and this Lord through your prayer shall lead this warke
after his own pleasure / and bring it to a perfyte end to his honor and
glory / and to profit and edificacyon of his faythefull servants. Amen.

Capitulum tertium. What Antecrist is in general with.vi. condycions.
TO speak generally if ye demand me who is Antechrist I answer and say
that he (whose life and doctrine is contrary to Christ's: Iohi^s. 2. Nunc aute^
sunt multi antechristi.
is an Antechrist / as seyncte John^ said / forsothe now been many
Antecristes. And therefore says seynct Austen. who that lives contrary to
Christ) is an Antechrist / be thou within or be thou without / be thou high /
or be thou low / be thou spu^all (as they call it) or be thou temporal / be
thou rich or poor / Pope or page or of any degree thou can rekene / if thou
live contrary to Christ / thou art but chafe whereof Christ speaks saying that
the chafe shall brine with fire that may not be quenched. Maih. 3.
And the soull that is but chafe shall ever suffer and never bye / as ye
prophet says. Ysa. ix. Every proud soul that ryseth in swellynge against
god / Ysaye. 9.
and every body defouled in Glottony and Lechery shall be into swellynge and
mete of the fire that shall ever brenne him with most grievous pain.

Sex peta^ contra spiritum sanctum.
Six sins there be against the holy ghost that took the wretched soull in to
this chafe / but for asmoche as no danger is feared but it be first known /
therefore we shall name them unto you in this little treatice for the learning of
the small understanders.

Presumptio. 1.
The first is presumpcyon / yt is the bolnynge or swellynge of a proud spirit
without dred of gods ryghtwysnes / and of this sin all manner of malice and
wretchydnes takes rote that reygneth in mankind among learned and leude / Qui
non timet non poterit iustificare Ecclesiastica. 15.
for the wyseman says / that he that dredeth not can not be iustyfyed or made
ryghtwyse. For sothe I say in whom this sin of presumption has no
lordeshyp in him the devil is overcome for he that dredeth the lord shall do
good things and again but if thou hold thy self continually in the dread of
god thy house shall be sone turned vpsydowne / Ibide^. 27.
that is thy body and soull shall be turned from god into the deuelles service.

Disperacion. 2.
The second syn is Dysperacyon or wanhope / that is over little trust of gods
mercy. Seynct Austyne says that the dread of gods ryghtwysnes / and hope of
his mercy been.ij. yates of life / for by them we entren here into grace and
after into bliss / as the prophet says. Our Lord is well pleased upon them
that dread him / and that trust in his mercy / and againwarde presumpcion and
disperacion been.ij. yates of death by the which me entren into sin and
inco^brance / and after into pain of hell. Iohi^s. 2.
Seyncte Johan gives us lore against this syn and says. My little sons /
these things I write to you / that ye sin not in the sin of dyspayre / but
if it so be that any of you have sinned we have an advocate against the father
Jesus Christ our just Lord / and he is the purchaser of mercy for our sins /
not only for ours / but for the sins of all the world. Jesus / is for to say
a savior for he has plenty of medecyne to save al mankind / if they will
take this medecyne and be saufe. Gregorius
For seyncte Gregory says He sleyth him self that will not keep the
byddynges of his leche.

The third syn is Obstinacy or hardness of heart that will not be contrite for
co^punction / nor soft with pity / nor moved with prayer / nor feared with
thretteni^ges / it settith not by betinges but unkind against all the works
of God / unfaithful in council / ferse and wood in Judgment / unshamefast
in sin / hardy in peril a Cowarde in manhood / folehardy against god /
forgetful of time paste neclygente in time present and inprouydente for the
time to come and shortly to say / Bernardus 5. de. 9. Linco^ln^ deo^ 190.
this is the sin that neither dredyth god / ne shameth man / for this sin
one Lynconln^ teaches a medecyne saying / that an hard heart would be brayed
in a mortar of stone with an heavy pestle: this mortar is the body of Christ
penetrate / and wounded in his passion / the pestle is the dread of dampnacyon
/ that follows after the sin. O thou hard hearted wretch / nyghthe to the
body of Christ / and for dread of dampnacyon confyrme the to his passion.
etc. The.iiij. sin is fynall Impenitence / that is he that will never be
penitent or sorrowful for his sin / but contynually leads his life after
the lusts of his flesh / ouercommen with the deuell / the world and the
flesh / for no man does very penance to god / but he that fully leuyth that
syn / for the which he suffers penance / thus says Sayncte Austyn / but for
they holden much worship to blase their name in earth they maken a feigned
shryfte to a pryste and taken part of sacraments they build churches with
other ornaments / and find prystes to read and sing / they releuen the poor
nedy / Math. 6. No^ne ala plus est quam esca and corpus plusque vestimentum.
and amenden places that be peryllous / but ever more they lie hard tongeled
as froste / in old custom and sin. To these vnrepenta^t or impenitent
persons speaks Gregory / most sharply in his Pastoralles upon Mathewe /
whether is not the life more then mete / and the body more than cloth / here
this doctor says. He yt gives mete or clothe to the poor nedy and is
polluted or defouled in wyckednes of body and soul / the thing that is most
he gives to sin / and the thing that is left he gives to ryghtwysnes /
his goods he gives to god / but him self to the deuel / for he settyth more
price by worldly richesse then he does by body and soull / and loves most
that god loves lest / wherefore he is turned to hate: god has given unto
man.v. precious gifts / the least of them is wordly goods / better then these
is man's body that god has endowed with kyndely strength and granted him
reason to use / this world him self to chastyce clothe or feed / above these
twain is man's soull that berythe gods image and his lykenes. Lord what
proffyt were it to win this world / and bring thy soull unto dampnacyon / and
the body is a lothesume careyn when the soul is departed therfrom. But gods
grace passes these.iij. for where his grace fails / no wisdom avails.
Look well that these things be not myspente / nether work thou any of them
besides their order / but that the streynght all to one end to win unto the
promise and gift of god that is the bless perdurable. Romanos. 1 An dinitias
bonitatis, etc.
But how thou tournest this order vpsydowne. Seynte Poule asks a questyon of
the. whether dyspisest thou the riches of the goodness of god and patience / and
long abydyng of thy god. Know thou not that the goodness of god ledyth the
or dryuith the to penance truly after thine hardness and thine unrepentant
heart / thou treasourest to the wrath in the day of wrath / and reuelacyon
of the ryghtwyse judgment of god / that shall yield to each man after his
works.

The.v. sin is Envy against thy brothers grace as when thy neighbor is wise
well governed / praised or borne up / rich welthy strong / fair or virtuous
in great abundaunce of grace / then this enuyous man sklaundreth / vpbreydeth /
repreueth / dispyseth / hatith / hinders / scorneth and pursues / to defoule
his brothers grace / Prouerbiocum. 14.
as much as he may / as the wysme^ says. A man walking in the high way and
dredynge the Lord / is despised of him that walks in the wrong way / when
Jesus Christ had cast out a deuel from a man that was dombe as it is written in
the gospeles of. Math. xij. Mar. iij. Math. 12. Marci. 3. Luce. 11.
Luce. xj. Anon this man began to speak to puplysshe this miracle among the
people. Than the Scrybes and Pharysees enuyous sects / that were a false
religyon sclaundred Christ saying that he did this miracle in Beelzebub prince
of deuelles. Belzabub is to say a god of Flies / or else a god that makes
dyscorde. Lord sythen they durst say this of Christ / head of al man's soull
/ how much warse (if warse may be) shall they adventure to say of his poor
servants prechers the truth of his law / but Prelates and Friars in these
days ben accombred with this sin against the holy ghost / and shamefully
sclaundren / her simple brether / ye trauaylen through Christ's holy law to
cast yuel manners from their souls prechynge the gospel to Christ's intent /
to turn the people to virtuous living / they say This man has eaten a fly
/ that gives him lore of gods law / this is more folly to eat a fly then be
a god and chase these flies / thus have they brought their malice about / to
sclau^der for heretyckes that speak of god and so drive they the people from ye
faith that they dare not wyrche ne speak for sclaundre. But truly they be not
wordye Christ that fear barkynges of these hounds for none is worthy to be
with his Lord / that shameth his service in well or in woo / and such men
show them selfs traitors to god / that with their deuelysshe la^gage defamen
their brethern / and saying / that the fend may and will make wise his
members that serve him in sin but so will not Christ his beloved servants
that lyuen in clennes to serve him in virtue. O I pray the who hard ever a
fouler blasphemy / certainly this dyspyte stretched into the godhede / to be
ponysshed in the day of judgment / for gods law teachethe / forbede him
not that can do well / but if thou may do well / do it. The priest should
not be let to preach the truth / neither the people to speak of their
believe as it is taught in the book of Numeri. vi. Numer. 11.
where it is written that Heldad and Medad prophesyed / al be it that they were
not lycenced by Moses. Iosue the Duke and minister of Moses / grutched
against these men / and complained on them to Moses. And Moses said to
Iosue. why art thou so enuyous toward me / who may let or withdraw that
all the people prophecye / if god give them his spyrite. This manner of doing
is also confyrmed in the gospel of our lord Jesus Christ. Seynte John^ the
Euaungelyste complained / to Christ saying. Master we have seen a man /
casting out deuelles in thy name that follows not us / and we have forbidden
him. Alas se then how dare our bysshhopes for shame offend against these
both gods laws / and doke their prestes on every side / geuynge them charge
on pain to do pryue the^ their office / yt they preach not the treuth. But
after the belly fasshyon. And Seyncte Ierom co^mendyth in prestehode prechynge
the gospel and blessyng the people before the saying of mass. Did. 56. 1.
Corin. 1. Non me mi sit christus baptizare sed euangelizare.
And Seynct Paull says / that Christ sent him to preche and not to baptyse. So
by this it apereth that prechynge the gospel is the highest feruyce that may be
done to god. But here the enemies of troth obiecten and leyen / for the^ this
text of Seynct Paul. How shall they preche / but if they been sent with this
text they blynden much people cuttynge the sentens from the words. To. 10,
Quomodopredicabu^t nisi mittantur.
For Poull meanethe that prestes should preach. For they be sent both of god
and of the bysshopes for to do that office / as the Master of the sentence
says in his.iiij. book / and the.iiij. and.x. Distinctyon. It is thoffyce of
a deken to preche the gospel / then by the more stronger reason it
apperteineth to a priest. For Seincte Ierom and Seyncte Bid accorden together
saying. right as thapposteles is the form of bishops / so in.lxxij.
discyples is the form of prestes. But Christ gave charge / both to these /
bysshopes / and also to these prestes saying. Math. 10. Ecce ego mitto vos.
Lo I send you as sheep among wolves. And Christ Jesus assygnynge.lxxij.
dysciples / sent ^em to preche. How shall these bysshopes maynteyne these
constitucyons against god and holy saynctes. Luce. 10. Designauit 72. et
misit. etc.
It shall be more sufferable to Sodom and Go^mer / than to this people that thus
dyscorden gods ordenaunces.

The syxt sin / is fighting against treuth that man knowith that is as when
truth is told to the gyltye / that is not dysposed to be amended / then he
makes blind and ungrounded reasons with sutle sophistical damnynge / the
truth against his own conscyens / with a bold face having no shame / as the
prophet Jeremy says. Jeremy. 3. Frons mulieris meretricis facta est tibi
and no luisti erubes cere. etc.
The face of an harlot is made unto the / and thou would not be asshamed. But
as Paul says Right as Iambnes and Me^bres against standen Moses in the sight
of Pharao so these again standen treuthe as men corrupt in their own
concyens. And if thou will know what these me^ be / ask of. Seynct Peter and
he will tell the / for he clepethe them by their names / in his epistle where
he says / that they been master liars that shall bring in among the people
sects of perdicyon / that is of loss and death / though ye risen with Lucyfer
/ and maken your nestes among the sterres. Thense ye shall / fall and dyssende
with the same Lucifer into hell there to be eternally tormented in pain that
shall last / and endure for evermore.

Zachary. 11. Sum tibi vasa pastoris stulti. etc
The Lord says by the prophet zachary. Take to the the vessels of a
folysshe sheparde for lo I shall suffer Antechriste to be raised by in earth /
the which shall not visit them that be forsaken / nor seek them that be
scatred nor hele them that be seek. Romanos. 8. Qui no^ hebet spiritu christi /
nec est cuin^.
O thou folysshe pastor / Antechryste Antechryste god says thou art an ydoll
having a bishops habyte. But neither virtue / spirit / life ne deed that
longyth to a bishop. For Paul says / that he which has not the spirit of
Christ he is not his servant / al be it that he have ye outward tokens And
therefore says seynct John^ the.v. Apo. 16. Quintus angelus effudit.
angel powered his crwette upon the sete of the best / and his realm is made
dark / and they byten their tongues to gether for sorrow / and they blasphemyd
god of heaven / for there sorrows and their wounds / and they did no penance
for their deeds / that is to mean Archebysshopes and Bysshopes been the sete
of the best Antechrist for in them he sytteth and reygneth over other people
in the darkness of his heresye / and in this they delyten them magnifyenge with
their tongues there false ordenau^ces the which is sorrow to them that been of
true understanding and thus they put abake gods law / for prechyng of
Christ's gospel yt which been sorrows to them gendrynge sins in their souls
/ that wounden him to ye death. And being thus wounded shall never do medefull
penance of deeds / for the which they shall be dampened. Lyncoln^ says. I dred.
I quake and hugely I am aferde: but I dare not be still / left peradventure the
sentens fall on me that the prophet says. woe to me: Ysaye. 6. De in quia
tacui.
that I have been still. The well / the beginning / and the cause of all ruin
and myschyefe is the court of Rome. Rome.
Now by thauctoryte of god / and one accord of holy saynctes shewyth an open
conclusion sadly grounded in true believe / that in the court of Rome / is the
heed of Antechryst / and in archebysshopes and bysshopes / is the body of
Antechrist / but in these patched / and clouted sects as Monks Chanons and
Freers / is the venomous tail of Antechriste / these.iij. parties be verefyed
of thapostle Jude sayng. woe to the^ that walks in the way of Cayne (these
been false possessioners) And woe to them that been shade out for mede in the
error of Balam: these been mighty nedlesse beggars / and woe to them that have
perysshed in the contradiccyon of Chore. These ben proud and stourdy
maynteners. How this Antechrist shall be distroyed god him self teaches by the
prophet Danyel: Danyel. 8. Sine manu conteretur.
saying that this Antechrist shall be dystroyed without hand / that is without
the power of man. For Paul says. Christ shall sle Antechryst with the
spirit of his mouth (that is with the holy word of his law) and the lord
shall dystroye him with the shynynge of his coming / that is with tournyng of
men's hertes by grace to his law a little before his danie* But god taught
more plainly this lord to Job. 40 Lo (says god) the hope that Antechryst
has in riches / and in worldly favor / shall bring him to naught / and all
men saying he shall be thrown down hedlyng. So that all the people shall make
waylynges upon him with great lamentacyon / cursynge waryenge and dampnyng him
with all his false ordenaunces etc.

What is Antechryst in special with.v. conditions. Capi. v.
But now at the last / we shall bring to mind holy David the king that had
given to him the full spirit of prophecye / and he seeing the coming of
Antechrist / his living and his fall / marketh.v. hydeous assaults that he
shall haunte against the servants of god Psalm. 9. Constitue dn^e legeslatorem
super eos.
The first assault of Antechrist / is his constitucions / as the prophet
says. Lord suffer thou to ordeyne a law maker upon ye people in pain of their
sins for that they consent not to the trought / that is thus to mean /
Antechryste uses falce lucratyfe or wynnyge laws / as ben absolucions /
indulgenses / pardones / privileges and all other heavenly treasure that is
brought into safe / to spoil / ye people of their wordly goods and
pryncipally these new constitucions / by whose auctorytie Antechryste
interditeth churches / someneth prechers / suspendith receyuers: and priueth
them their benefice / cursyth herers / and takes away the goods of them /
that furtheren the prechynge of the trought ye though it were an angel of
heaven. But if the pressed show the mark of the best / that they have properly
turned into a new name calling hit a special lettre of license / for the
more blyndynge of the people. The second Assault of Antechryst / Despicis
oportunita tibz i^ tribulacione. etc.
is tribulacion / as the prophet says. Antechryste vexes the people
ouermyghtely / in hunting the people on mawmetry / and doing of Idolatry /
but ever Antechryst makes the^ to wene that they gone on pylgremage. And
therefore he is warned of god by the prophet saying. Ysaye. 5.
woe to you that sayen / good is ill / and ill is good putting light into
darkness and darkness into light. Tornynge sweet into bytternes / and
bitter into swetnesse. And thus does Antechryste when he translateth virtues
into vices / and vices into virtues / as pylgremage into outrage / and outrage
into pylgremage / and for this wawarde intent god despyseth Antechrist with all
blyndefelde people / and lateth al their myspended goods in their most
tribulacion. The.iij. assault of Antechrist is inquificio^ as ye prophet
says / that Antechrist enquyreth secheth and harkeneth / where he may find
any man or woman that writes lerneth redith or studyeth gods law in their
mother tongue: to lead their lives after the pleasynge will of god. Anon he
catches them in his sensures / and after smyteth as he may most hurt them /
but he shall not make this inquisicion after the multitude or greatness of his
wrath. For god shall refrain or abrydge the power of his malice / so that he
shall no more do than god will suffer him yt knows the mesour of his deeds to
prove his servants by the fornays of penance acceptable. And Antechryst with
these me^ thus herted in malice inexcusable.

Insidiatur vt capiat pauperem.
The.iiij. assault of Antechrist is persecucyon as the prophet says. That
Antechrist sittyth in the ease of this world with rich men in their dens.
But the poor meke simple and lowly / them he espyeth and pursues / he
ouerlepeth and ouerronneth rauesshynge them both bodily and gostely. Job. 40.
For god says unto Job / that has a trust and a trowynge that Jordan may
flow into his mouth. And therefore he makes his dwelling place in the heart
of the sea as our Lord says by his prophet / Eze. 20.
that Antechryste makes his boste and says by his prophet. I have sytten in
the chair of god in the heart of the sea / when thou art but man and no god.
But ever in fat countres walowynge and habundyng of worldly goods there is
Antechrist with his clerks buyldyng their nestes. And if thou look witterly
about / thou shall find the^ among woods and waters / as seyncte Johan
says / yt he saw out of the mouth of the dragon that is the heed of
Antechryst / Apocalipsis. 10. Vidi de ore draconis et de ore bestie et de ore
pseudo prophet tres spiritus inmundos ex isse in modu^ ranarum.
and out of the mouth of the best that is the body of Antechrist and out of
the mouth of the false prophet / that is ye tail of Antechryst. Three unclean
spirytes to have passed out in the manner of frogs / sitting in holes by the
water brynke / purchasen of the ground above and on the earth beside them but
that that is underneath them they woll not her thanks neither lose ne lose it.
So these. iij. unclean spirits crokyng in Couetyse / Glotony / and Lechery /
betoken Antechryste with his.iij. parts for they purchasen of lords that been
above them much part of their good with the tongue of flattry and feigned
Ipocresy / and of the commoners about them / they wylen in their hands much
part of their catayle / but that they have won they holden fast again
thauctoryte of gods laws. And with these rycheses they noryshen wild
stourdy / and lawles men / that pursuen them that woll ought say against this
cursyd sin. But in this persecutyon / the prophet comfort the servants
of god saying. God is our refuge and our virtue / god is our help in
trybulacions the which have over much / or passyngly founden us / wherefore we
shall not dread whylles that men living after this world been troubled / and
hills shullen be borne over into the heart of the sea yt is to say. True men
shall not be abashed though proud flesshly men be comforted to Antechriste
and helpen him in his persecutyon.

The.v. assault of Antechryst is execucyon / Capere pau perem dn^m attrahit
eu^.
as the prophet says. when Antechryst says that he avails not in these
forsayde tourmentes / than he executyth his malice against Christ's chosen /
as saynct John^ says. That the best of the earth shall give power to the
best of the sea / for in this time of execucyon. The vicious part of the lay
/ se from the highest degree to the lowest / shall consent to execute the
wyckednes of the vicious part of the clergy. Than shall this prophesye be
fulfilled psalm. 78. They shall shede out innocent blood / and no man shall dare
bury their bones / for they shall cast their flesh to fowls of the air /
and their careyns to bestes of the earth. Than says the prophet that when
Antechryste weneth he has lordeshyp over all the servants of god reysynge
upon them guiues of diverse tormetry then shall he fall to open repreue for ever
more The full time of Antechriste dureth.iii. years and an half / but that the
gospel does remytte / and else should not all flesh be made save / this time
was fygured under Ely the prophet. And king Achab that wicked man / Regum. 3.
cap. 17. Iacobi. 5. Regum. 28 Danyel. 7.
there shewyth the story that the rain was stopped.iij. years / and.vj.
months / seynct James bears wytnes of this thing in his canon epistle. The
flyenge of Dauyd from king Saul marketh this time who so takes head and read
that book to ye last end. Also the lesynge of Jerusalem dyscloseth this time
as Josephus tells. Danyel taught this nombre also i^ time and times and half
a time / and this is.iij. years and demi / as saint Hierom declares in his
book and seyntes of the mighty Macabeus under this time made clean their
Temple / wherefore saint Johan in his Apocalipse / often times reherseth this
nombre when he speaks of Antechryste. And Christ keeps this nombre for the
time of his prechynge out take that lest by virtue of his passion sayncte
John^ Crysostom / upon Mathewe ca. 57. says / by three years and.vj. months
/ the sacryfyce of gods praysynge that should be in man's mouth / the
sacryfyce of ryghtwysnesse that should be in man's works / and the sacrafyce
of peace that should be in tretynge of Christ's body / shall be taken away from
all faithful through strong woodnesse of Antechryste / then shall all true
chrystiane fle the face of Antechryste / so that none shall now enter into the
church to do due service to their god / after this the people shall turn
with all their might both chrystiane and Jews / to the keeping of gods law
and doing of virtuous penance as Paul wytnessynge says. Blyndnes fell by
part in Israel unto the time that plentye of hethen gentles should enter into
chrystendom. To. 11.
And then in the end of the world that is after the destruccyon of Antechryste
al Israel shall be made save. Enocke and Ely become
No man look after Enoke and Ely in person for than they may lyghtelye be
begyled / but in spyrite and in virtue now they be come: to make men's hertes
ready before christ's home / to whom be glory now and ever. Amen.

What is the church only appropried to god with their names / lykenesis and
conditions. Ca. vi.
TO spek of holy church First we take ground of the gospel where Christ
says. Math. 19. Port inferi non preualebu^t aduersus eam Nicholaus de Lira.
That ye gattes of hell shall not prevail nor have might / against holy church /
upon this text Lyre says. That the church is not in me^ by way of power or
dignite spiritual or temporal for many Princes / and high Bysshopes and other
of lower degree: state and dignite are founden to be apostates or have gone
back from the faith / wherefore the church stands in those persons in whom
is knowing and very confession of faith and troth. But for the more clear
declarynge of this matter / and avoiding of objections that may be put forth
we shall understand / yt there been.iii. churchis of the which gods law often
makes mencyon: Tres Ecclesie.
and much they dyuersen each from other / to them that taken good head: but
here wytles foles been accombred that labor not to learn to know their
dyuersytees. The first church is called a little flock as Christ says.
Prima ecclesie. Luce. 12.
Dread ye not my little flock / hit pleases your father to give you a kingdom
/ and this church is cleped the chosen nombre of them: that shall be be saved as
it is written / that the sons of wisdom been the church of ryghtwysemen /
Ecclesia. 3.
and the nation of them is buxoume to god and loving to his even christen.
Ephe. 5.
This church is called a clean maiden as Paul says. Christ has chosen him a
glorious church having neither spot nor wemme or any such other / Distinc.
13.
but that this church may be holy and vndefouled to this accords Lyncoln^
saying that holy church of god is a chaste virgin christ's glorious spouse
without spot or bleyne. The.iij. time this church is called christ's spouse of
this marriage Paul beryth wytnes saying. I have married you to one man: that is
not to an auoutrer / Corin. 10.
but to a laufull man Christ Jesus / that I may present you to god / a clean
chaste maid at the day of dome / and thus we say in the dedycacyon of the
material church. This day holy church a glorious spouse is married to Christ
her sovereign. Ioha^nes. 6
This church is lykened to a woman with child as Christ says. A woman when
she trauayleth she has pains. Apo. 12.
This church is lykened to a woman clade in the son / as sayncte John^ in
Thapocalips says / I saw a wounderfull sight and that was a woman clade in
the son This church is also lykened to Peter's little bote being in the
mids of the sea / this bote both sanke and swame. Math. 14 Mar. 6. Luce. 8.
But drown might hit never / so holy church suffers many perells / and some
time bodily death by pursuit of enemies / but it shall never be dampened. This
church is lykened to Paradyce / Eze. 30.
thus says the prophet. Cedre trees were not higher then he in paradyse of
god. where upon saynct Austen says. Paradyce is holy church the.iiij. flodes
ben the iiij. gospelles written of Mathewe / Mark / Luke / and Johan / that
were fygured in lykenes of.iiij. bestes / that is a man / a Lion / a Calfe an
Egle / for these precheden Christ the which is to gether / man / knight /
priest / and god / and by these.iiij. Story. Allegory. Moral. Anagogical
we ben taught in story what is done / in allegorye what we should believe / in
moral what we shall do / and in Anagogye what we shall hope. The trees that
beren fruit / been good lyuers here in earth. The fruytes of these trees /
been good works of saynctes the tree of life is the sayncte passing all
saynctes our lord Jesus Christ. The tree of knowing good and evil / is the
free choice of man's will. This is holy church only propred to god that
serves him in virtue night and day / but how ever we speken in diverse manners
or likeness of this holy church / they teachen not else / but this one name
that is to say the congregacyon or gadrynge to gether of faythefull souls /
that ever more kepen faith / and trought in word and deed to god and man and
reysen their life in syker hope of mercy and grace and bliss / at their end
and helen this building in perfyte charity / that shall not fail in well ne
woe / of this spoke sayncte Paul / Corinth. 3. Templum enim dei sanctum est /
quod estis vos.
to the Corintheans and in them to all other saying The temple of god is holy
and that be ye so than by this hit apperethe that the soull of every faythefull
of every christian man / is the sete and very temple of god / well ought than
every man to be ware and wise that has the great god lord of Israel
dwelling in his soull. And so says sayncte Austen. O thou christen soull a
wake / and if there by any virtue of charity in the that susteyneth all things
/ follow thou the steps of thy lord / take heed how many thousand marters
have made asmoche plain way to the / there have passed before the virgynes /
chylder / young dammeselles and maidens / and if thou dredyste / arise thou
soul for he shall lead the / that is the way / the trought and the life /
the way that errethe not / the trought that never begyled / and the life never
faylynge / way in example / troughte in promyssyon / life in mede. And to this
entente / Christ lykened man's soul to a woman with child / for in her
travail she has strong pains / but when she has borne the child into
this world / she has no mind of her pain / for Joy of the child. Thus
wandrythe holy church / in earth in prayers / fastings / and in waylynges /
in abstinens / in tribulacio^s and in anguyshe / in persecucyon / in need: and
in prison / in cold / in hungre / and in heaviness / in bonds / in fetters /
and great dystres / in thyrst in pain / and in blame / in reproach / in
sclaundre / and in shame / in pacyens / pity / and long abydyng / in simplenes
/ lykenes / and sighs / in weeping / waylynge / and in woe / in fortune / in
sobrenes and in chastity / in spedynes in largenes / and in charity. These be
ye gronynges of man's soull / that longs in heart after Christ her spouse /
till she have brought forth her self a child of god into bliss perdurable /
and than for ye greatness of gods reward / ye more she suffered ye more is her
Joy / for so says seynct Paul yt the passions of this time been as no pains
in regard to ye glory yt is to come / yt shall be showed in us for tha^ we
shall be endowed with.iiij. doweryes in our bodies. 1. Cor. 15.
Of the which seynct Paull spekyth / saying that the body that is sown in
corrupcyon / shall rise without corrupcion / in this church of god at ye day of
dome. And this dowre is cleped immortalite or vndedlynes / yt body that is
sown unworthy / shall rise in glory: and this dowry is called clerenes / that
body that is sown in infyrmyte or instablenes / shall rise in virtue / and
this dowry is called Agilite or swyftenes. That body that is sown bestiall
shall rise spiritual / and this dowry is called subtylite. But there been
other four dowryes of substanciall medes / with the which we shall be dowred in
our soul. The first dowry is called impossibilite / the second is tuicion /
the.iij. perpetual charity / the.iiij. is fruytion. Or after this manner to
speak more plainly: the first is knowledge without error / the second is mind
without forgetting / the third is well without co^tradiccyon: and the.iiij. is
thus of the godhede and love of god everlasting. O what a woundrefull joy is
this / where the soul shall be fed with the sight of the godhed: and certes /
this is joy without wrechydnes / rest without busynes / mirthe without heaviness
/ surety endeles / of al discord lotheles. This is comfort in all gladness: of
purueyans / careless. Ysaye. 64 Corinth. 2.
This wytnessith the prophet Ysaye and seynct Paul in his epistle says yt
bodily yie has not seen / ne ear has herd / ne heart of man thought: what
things they be that god has ordained or prepared to them yt love him. P
Lord who shall not auance his feeble wits to think on that lovely company
that prayseth in heaven the goodness of this inscrutable godhede / father and
son and holy ghost. To begin at Mary Christ's mother / queen of heaven /
lady of therthe and Impresse of hell. Nine orders of Angels in glorious wise
that dwelling in their heavenly selles / to do the pleasynge will of god: in
heaven and in earth / as their order asks. And patriarchs our elder fathers
that streytly kept the byddinges of god: there they resten of all their
travail in land of life with double mede. There been prophets that seen in
spirit the mystery of Christ's incarnacyon they told the coming of this
lord in hope abiding man's salvation. Evangelists ben there high in bliss
yt walken with Christ and wryt his words. Apostelles sent into all the world
and Christ's discyples to preche the gospel turnyng Jews and hethen me to
Christ's law / there they sitten on seetes upon.xij. trones and shallinge with
Christ in the dome the xij. tribz of Israel Math. 19. There ben marters that
shede there blood and suffered pains to enlarge their joy / and for they
passed by fire and water they have found refresshynge to their souls / also
there be co^fessours yt opened christ's law to this world / and neither for
felony ne for shame would never deny / that blissyd lord / there ben virgins in
body and soull that kept the^ in clennes from lust of flesh. And to this
bliss be taken both leryd and lewd that done there vttermoste will to keep
gods commandments no tongue may tell the sothe as it is. (...)
But thus we seien to amend our devotion that we might have that bliss in
mind / and take a part among these saynctes. But saynct Johan when he was
led in spirit saw in heaven a wonderful sight and for to chere mankind in
earth / he left it written in his book that is to say. Apocalipsis. 13.
Saint Johan saw a woman clade in the son / and moan under her fete / and a
crown upon her head of the.xij. sterres / this woman betokens man's soull /
as we took wytnes of Christ before / and certain this was a blyssedfull sight
to se the church in her wedding clothes / the son that this church is
cladde in / is that most worshypfull garnement our salvation / that excellent
and most commendable lyuerey our redempcyon / that holy and most precious
cloth our chrystendome / and our relygion / for this Christ betoke us when we
were baptized as Paul says. Gal. 13. Quicu^que baptizati estis christu^
induistis.
All ye that be baptized ye be clade Christ / Jesus the son beryth lyghtnesse
of our baptym for certain propertyes that it has of the son / other lyghtes
borowe there shyni^g / both moan and sterres in their due course and else
they ben ouerleade with darkness / that may not comfort to night ne day. So
all man's warke in word and deed borowith there light at Christ. Jesus for he
is the son of ryghtwysnesse as Mardoche says in the spyryte of god.8. that
is to say Light and son is vpsprynge to us and meke lowly men vphaunsed in his
saynctes ye book declares what this is to mean / Psalm. 113.
light is vpsprongen to rightnesse / that wandren in darkness of his life /
and this is our lord Jesus Christ that of his own mercy has showed / the
people. And this we read of true believe in the story of our blessed Lady / yt
is to say / Mary a virgyn has borne the sovereign son of richtwisnes that
is godde^ (...) heaven Christ Jesus both god and man / (...) man does that
fails this light / it (...) yndelinge and the doungi^ on of hell / and when
this son shyneth in his works he growith by hete of grace / and rypeth that
shynen in this crown ben the.xij. artycles of the common creed / that is to
say. Credo in deum. etc. Thus should that soull be arrayed that is chosen to be
Christ's spouse / and worthyly is holy church lykened to a woman / for a woman
brings forth both sons and daughters of her womb / but not without help
and the worchynge of man's sede. So our mother holy church bears in her belly
souls to be borne to the bliss of heaven / but never without ye help and
worchynge of the grace of our lord Jesus Christ / Ioha^. 16. Sine me no^
potestis facere.
as the gospel wytnesshyth / saying. without me ye may do nothing / that is
to say medefully or thankworthy. Here some men obiecten and sayen / that the
gospel is not of auctorytie / but inasmoche as the church has auctorysed and
chanonised it for they sayen. No man knowith such words to be gospel / but as
the church has determined in her determinacyon / this conclusion seems to
smacke heresy / Gene. 2.
by the wytnes of saynct Austen saying on this wise. Heresy is false teaching
contrary to holy writ full hardely defended most because of worship and worldly
wynnyng / and sithen al these ben fou^den in this foresaid objection it is full
suspect of heresye / for it is written from the beginning that god ordained
man to be head and lord over the woman. And agaynwarde the woman to be
vnderloute and subject unto man. Ephe. 5.
But Paul says. This great sacrament of knyttyng to gether a man and his wife
betokens the knyttyng to geder of Christ and his church / shall not than
man's soull vnderloute to Christ in word and deed / in this spiritual
marriage more perfictly tha^ this woman can or may in the sacrament of flesh /
saynct Iamys distroyeth this objection saying / Iaco. 1
that god has wylfully and of his own will gotten us through the word of truth
/ that we may be sum beginning of his creature / and this creature is one
passing creature holy church / that was chosen in the time of grace / by the
water of clensynge by Christ's blood of again byenge / and by the virtue of
the holy ghost hallowyng were it not against reason. Ye and open heresy to
maynteyne that the word of god that has gotten this creature holy church /
Cant. 6. Pulcra vt luna.
should not be of auctoryte without auctorisyng of this creature holy church /
wherefore this conclusyon approved we grant of believe / yt the church is
vnderloute to Christ and his word in.iiij. manners. First as the moon to the
son / the church is fair as the moon. Ysaye. 55.
The second as therth to the fyrmament of whom it is made plentuous or
watrede as dew comythe down from the fyrmament and tourneth not thither
again. But watrethe therth and makethe hit plentuous of fruytes so the word
of god norysshethe holy church and makethe hit to bring forth good fruytes.
The.iij. manner as the flesh to the spyryte / Iohe^s. 6.
of whom it is quyckened for it is the spyryte that quyckeneth and gives life.

The.iiij. Ephe. 1.
manner as the body to the heed if whom it is governed for god the father
has made his son Christ / the heed of the church / Collo. 1.
and efte saynct Paul says Coll. 1. Christ is the heed of the body of the
church / and every chosen man and woman is called a son or a daughter of the
church / To. 12.
but all to gether ben the fullbody of this church as saint Paul says. we
many ben one body in Christ Jesus forsothe each of us ben others members / but
some chylder of this woman ben simple laborers / and for that they parten and
deuyden their true labor or travail / therefore they represe^te the good love
of the holy ghost / and these dreden the lord and walken in the ways of his
commandments / as the prophet says. Psalm. 127.
Blessed be all laborers that dread the lord and walken in his ways / for
thou shall live by the labor of thine hands / thou art blessed and well
shall be to the / and this is the lowest estate that we call commons / some of
these woman's children taken material sword and ben made ministers of Christ's
godhed having power and dread into wrath / and vengeans of them that done
yuell / and praysyng of them yt done well / and so by thauctoryte of saint Johan
baptyst in the gospel of Christ. Luce. 3. and of saynct Peter. 12. and of
saynct Paul Romans 13. and by the decre of saynct Ysodore. 23. q. 5. Principes /
it apperteyneth to the order of knyghthode / to defend gods law / to
mainteyne good lyuers / and to justify or punyshe misdoers / and this is
cleped the second state in holy church / but some chyldre of this woman styren
into high order of presthode / and ben ministers of Christ's manhede and these
have wit and wisdom to open to the people the way of truth / and this
estate represents the second person in trynyte / that is the wisdom of ye
father our lord Jesus Christ For sayncte Austyn says. Knyghthode represe^tyng
the power of the father / is the vyccar of the godhede / and presthode
representynge the wisdom of the son is the vyccar of the manhede. And these
knights techynge unto us / the dread of gods ryghtwysnes that punyssheth
obstinate and open sinners / turnynge from his law in shrewdnes of their
hertes / and prestes techen us by way of office ye love that god has to his
people / that forgeueth them all their sins when they come to him and do very
penance / than help prestes with sacraments to please god and win his love
/ for Paul monesshyth the pressed Tymothy and in him al other prestes to take
good intent to.v. things / Tymo. 4.
in which fully their offices standen / saying. Awake thou priest in busy
prayer prayenge for the people devoutly. The second is this. Travail ye pressed
in the lessons of holy writ studieng gods law / only. The third is this Do
thou the work of the gospel prechyng gods law truly. The.iiij. is this.
Fulfill thou ye mynistery mynystrynge the sacraments freely. The.v. is this. Be
thou sobye in word and deed / doing and suffrynge lastyngly. Upon these.iij.
estates stands the church that is appropryd to god / and by the virtue of
Christ's incarnacion hit growith in mede to come to bliss. As Odo says / that
Christ Jesus took flesh and blood in the maydene womb and was borne both
god and man to annex our kind to his godhed / for when he took our manhede /
he granted us his godhed. And in this time in special manner he first gave
ernest to this church / after this was Christ Jesus daptysed in Jordan and
tempted thryse of the fend to learn us mekely to suffer temptacyon / and took
the death upon the cross / by cruel judgment of the Jews. And than the
church was trought plyght to Christ / cleped by name his fair clean spouse /
and as she had grace by devotion of faith / so she had worthynes of this name.
But when this church is gone to heaven / and restyth in bliss with Christ / her
spouse / than is this marriage fully sacred with deyntes everlasting delytes.
whiles this life dureth in earth this church is cleped militant. And when she
slepeth in Purgatory then is she cleped the church slopande. But when she
restith of all her travail then she is cleped the church triumphant. Or thus
more plainly. A true soull here in this life / fyghteth against the waves of
sin to fle thassaultes of these.iij. enemies the fend / the world / and the
wanton flesh / in purgatory she cleanses her self from rust and corrupcyon.
But in heaven she holds the tower and the victory of all her enemies / and
has wone the crown of life that god has granted to his lovers. etc.

What is the church materyall. Capitulo. vii.
THe second church dyuerseth from this for it is coming to gether of good
and ill in a place that is hallowed / far from wordly occupacyon / for there
sacraments should be treated / and gods law both red and preched. Of this
church speaks the prophet Dauyd saying. Bless ye the lord god in churchis /
Psalm. 67.
in this place our gracious god hereth our prayer in a special manner / and
bowyth his ear to his servant in form as he granted Salamo^ / saying. Re.
9. Parali. 7.
Mine eyes shall be open / and mine ears shall be lift up to the prayer of the^
that has justly prayed in this place / and this is cleped a materyall place
/ but it is made by man's craft of lyme / timber / and stone / with other
necessaryes that longs thereto / for man's profyt this place is made / but
not so / man for the place. Math. 12. Mar. 2. Luce. 6.
And this Christ marketh in the gospel for man should not be begyled saying
that the sabot is made for ye man / and not man for the sabot / for man by
virtue of gods word / hallowith this place / but this place may not hallowe
man. But man be first in cause / as Ierom says. The place halloweth not the
man / but ye man halloweth the place. Alas then what wodenes is this to bost of
holy places / and we our selfs vicious foles. Lucyfer was in heaven which is ye
most holy place / but for sin he fell into hell / the place might not hold
him. Adam was in paradyce / the most merry place / and for his syn was driven
thens / the place might not defend him. Thou that art not in heaven nor in
paradyce / but in this wretched world where wenyst thou to find a place to
hallowe the that leuyst not thy sin. Be thou seker as god is in heaven it will
not be / for god is in no place fair served / but there as his law is fair
kept of his people. Saynct Ambrose says. Adam that was the more worthy was
made without paradise in the vnworthyer place Eve that was the less worthy was
made within paradise in the worthyer place / much people demeth a medefull
warke to make amends again with curious buyldynges / and many fair musters
in the church / but Ierom forbedeth this thing to be done / and dampneth hit
utterly for great syn now in this time of Christ's gospel saying. Many
buylden walls / and pillars of the church / they under putten with shyninge
marble stones / ye beams glystern all in gold / the aulters ben dyuersly
arrayed with precious stones / but of ye ministers of god there is no choice. No
rich man bye to me the temple in Jury / bordes / lanternes / sensers / pannes
/ cups / morters / and such other made of gold / for than these things were
approved of the lord when prestes offered hosts and blud of bestes was
remyssyon of sins / though all these things went before in figure
nevertheless: they be written to us into whom the ends of the worlds be come.
Now truly Christ our poor lord has hallowed the house of ye church of our
pouertye bear we the cross of Christ / riches account we as clay. Upon this
writteth a great clerk saying that such men semen to turn the bread of
poor men into stones / and in that they ben more crueller than the devil /
that asked stones to be turned into bread. To this accords sayncte Barnarde
saying. O vanyte of all vanytees / and no more vanite tha^ asmoch madder / ye
church shines in walls: and she needs in the poor / her stones she lappeth
in gold / and her own sons she forsakes naked of the charges and expe^ces
of the nedy is made a vain seruys to the yes of rich men. But our new feigned
sects / in this be most to blame / that maken great buyldynges / there lest
need were / as Monks / Chanons / and Friars / No^nes / Systers and spytlers /
for people should draw to parysshe churches / and here the word of god there
as god has lymyted / and else they ben to blame. Lord what means these
waste places of these hyd Ipocrytes / but to tell men by their synagoges where
Satan's sete is / there lurken to gethers many rauysshynge wolves / yt spoylen
the people with their falce sines for reasons of holy wryt declared of doctors
should teache you of this great defaulte if that ye will amend. But here me
dredeth as Paul fayeth / that the god of this world that is called Mammon /
has cast his pouldre before your eyes and blent your gostely light / Cor. 4.
that ye may not know the gospel to the true understanding / and that one
pain of your great sin / till this sentence be fulfilled / each corruptible
/ or each work that is rotten in ye rote shall fall in the end / and he that
is founder of such ungrounded work shall fall and worth to naught therewith
in the last end. God planted never these sects in neither of his laws
neither approved such manner of life. Christ in his life pulled them up by the
rotes / that were i^ his days as Asseys / Saduceyes / and Pharysees and
dampened their ordenaunce and said when they grow again in Monks / Chanons /
and Friars that they should be drawn up again by the rote / as the gospel
wytnessyth where Christ said. That each plant that my father of heaven has
not planted shalde rent up by the rotes. For all synneful inuencyons in man or
in place / that is among the people of the which god is not auctor / though
it grow fast for a time / it shall be distroyed. The first reason that we shall
make is showed in this manner. These sects ben ded from this world / as they
say in word / if this be sothe / then shall they have poor cotes of
mourning to tell in deed that this death is true in them / and in their works
and fle the manner of this world in such sterynge vanyte is as Paul teaches
in his pystle unto the Collosenses saying. Ye that been dead / from the manners
of this world / Collo. 3.
your life is hyd with Christ in god / therefore mortefy ye / and make ye deed
your members that upon the earth the which ben fornicacyon of your members and
uncleanness of foul desires with corrupt liking of flesshely lusts and foul
couetyce of your hertes / and avarice of gredy gatherynge which is service of
ydolles and very ydolatry. For these things comethe the wrath of god upon the
sons of mysbeleue / if ye sects forsake this lore / the wrath of god shall
sone assail you. The second reason that we maken against such buyldynges is
said thus / busynes about such costely buyldynges with many afolde worldly
occupacyons to reparell them / when they payren and to hold them up. In the
same form bryngethe in neclygens of gostelye manners quenchynge of virtues /
and good thewes. As Bernarde says. That holy monk / that sued the steps
of Jesus Christ / and would not vary from the gospel to blame these sects that
gone away / I se (said he) that may not be seen / without great sorrow /
many after that they be entered into the knyghthode of Christ / that is to
forsake this world and wilfully suffer payneful living / efte they be drowned
in worldly covetous and ben wrapped / with worldly needs and busynes / they
reuen up walls but they ben neclygent in good thewes. what profytith it to
have hye temples and the walls all gylte with gold / where the spyryte of god
wantethe. Forsothe god has no delight in such wretched synful sects. But god
will that our temples / the which ben our souls / to be honored with holy
virtues and last to the end in good works. The third reason is mighty and
strong that spryngeth with other in gods law / that such as part them by
them self from common life of other men / should be algates in this way as
strangers that been far from home and pylarymes in there pylgremage. Hebre. 13.
As Paul says unto thebrues. we have here no dwelling place or cite / but
we seken that is to come. Lord how dare these sects for shame with poor
men's goods and pyllage of lords defend this foul apostacye against their
god and holy saynctes and tell the lewd people by words of ypocresy / that
thus they do to god worship / and this is doble wyckednes for Bernardus says.
we that been in pylgremage of this world / as abiecte and outcast / should make
no waste houses for to dwell in as lords of this world / but little cottes to
serve in and sone to leave them and go to bliss / Barnard.
we seruen in a strange country we trauelen in a strange country. Thus says
Bernarde. The fourth reason and the last is full lively / and on this manner.
Gods law charge on all wise to love thy neybour as thy self / but this
love is lest made known by good ensample of word and deed / in what things
may these sects profit that reuersen here Christ's rule / and given ensample
to their neybour in proud and in false couetice and shown them rychest and
most wordly in mete / cloth / and in curious building / but this forbedyth the
doctor Bernarde whom we have often rehearsed / forsothe (says he) lowly houses
and poor refraynen the couetyse of other / and we owen rather to meruell the
great works of god / in the sight of heaven than in the sight of buyldyng of
man's handy work / and much more we should marvel the great works of god
than ye works of dedly men that duren but a while / Bernard.
all holy saynctes according in this that our church materyall that is
ordained for pharysshens where they come to geder shall be made with virtuous
means and in an honest measur. But on all sides it must be flede that in this
church there show no pride nor outrage passinge the bonds of pouertye /
neither in stone timbre nor led / neither in glass lyme nor plaster /
neither in bell / lamp / nor light / neither in chalice / book / nor vestyment
/ neither in steple seetes / nor payntynge / nor in other ornaments that
longen to this church. And diligently this must be kept that they bow to
pouertye to eschew vain glory of this world / and gloryfye the cross of
god. But this word of Christ's cross is folly to him yt should be dampened /
that tenten to signs as commyn hoorys and lesen the virtue of their souls.
Paul co^mendythe the coming of Christ / and the low mekynge in his
manhood. Forsooth (says he) to the Corinthians. Ye owen to know the grace of
our lord Jesus Christ / for when he was rich in all things he was made poor
in man for us that ye should be rich in gostely things thoroughe this
virtuous need of Christ. Christ that blames all wanton means in the service
of his people / will not authoryse it him self ne defend it in his own house
/ as saynct Math. 24. Mark. 13. Luce. 21. according to gether in this one
sentence. Mat. 24. Mar. 13. Luce. 21.
That when Ihu^ went out of the temple their p^ized him his dyscyples for to
show him the building thereof and the curious work in stones wenyng thus to
please their master in seeing so fair a temple. But Christ / that had an
inward sight how the deuelles brekynge his law went a way with doleful chere
and taught his discyples of things to come how this temple should be
distroyed and bad him beware that no man be gyle them / and sore Christ wept
upon this cite for man's building stood full strong / both body and soul
that he had made to his own dwelling place were fall from keeping of his law
in to the swolowe of stynkynge sin. But scrybes and phareseis were in cause
of this great myschefe as Mathewe says wherefore Christ warned them as his
greatest enemies and all there folowers to the worlds end Christ says Math.
23. Mat. 23.
woe to you scrybes and phareseys that clensen clean all that is outward / but
certes within ye ben replete with much raueyne and uncleanness / ye bylden the
toumbys of holy prophets and wonderly honoren there graves and ye sue your
fathers steps in pursuynge of ryghtwyse blood / and these sects do the
same but with more malice in word and deed. O ye edders whelps how shall ye
flee the judgment of hell / thus says our lord Jesus Christ whereto make ye
shrynes to saynctes and yet ye drawn hangen and brenne them that holden the
way of Christ and wandren after this holy saynctes / and you show not in your
outward deeds / ye done this slaughter in word and will / as phareseys with
bysshopes in the third hour foriudged our lord with there tongues / and after
knights after the syxte hour hanged his body upon the cross. So these
sects gone before to smite the people with tongue / and after knights of
herodes house been full ready to make an end / but the cause of this pursuyte
ben two vycyous extremities. One is temporal possessyon ye wrongefully
stands in prestes hands. The othere is synnefull beggerye of mighty men /
with huge byldynge of many waste places / and needs they must be amended by
charity of god for to save their souls. For tho that maynteyne these.ij.
outstrayes been full of many sclaunders by teaching of the devil of hell /
lest his retynewe forsake them / for than we shall find peace in earth when we
keep Christ's ordenaunce / and care naught / though thou be slaundrede / and
thou lead a just and perfyte life to righten this mysse put to thine hand /
and think what Christ behitith Marc. 8. Marc. 8.
who that has lost his life for me and for the gospel. He shall make his
soull safe in the bliss of heaven.

Of good and evil coming to this materyall church. Capi. viii.
AFter these we shall speak of two diverse parties that comen to gether to this
church both of good and ill. First we taken for our ground Christ's holy
gospel where he spekythe in a parable to his own dyscyples. Math. 13.
Math. 13. The realm of heaven is like to a net that is sent in to the sea and
gatherith to geder of all the kind of diverse fysshes / and when this net was
full of fysshes the fysshers drew it to the land and they sitting beside the sea brynke / chose the good into their vessels / the yuell they sent out and
kept them again in the sea. This parable is thus to mean after ye wit of Ihu^
Christ. Second church here in earth is like to a net senden into the sea for
as the sea ebbith and flows. So this church now ryseth and falls to
praise / for as the tempests of the sea ben hydeous and perylous for the net.

Pride.
So Pride that wauith in this world is full noyous to Christ's church. Of
beawty of fortune / of goods / of grace / all day men bolnen in hyenes of
heart.

Envy.
The sea water is full bitter and full frowysshe in the casting / and this
world is full of envy that is full bitter for to taste with hate as the soote
that none vnnyth can acorde with other / and over the sea comes grievous
storms with pyryes that greuen sore.

And in this world ryseth wrath with anger of heart that does much tene /
wrath.
in the sea no grass may grow neither as far as it may flow / but it
wastyth all the ground and makes it naked without fruit.

And in this world is vicious slowthe that stroyeth virtues in body and soul
/ Slowthe.
and makes man foltyd in his wits in every part where so ever he streche:
the sea ay purchases with his waves / and wynnith of ground that he neghith /
and is not apayed of the terms that god has set if it might escape.

And in this world is couetyse of them that purchasyn with wrong their
neyboures ground and catteles with sleyght cautyls of man's law. Couetyse.
Thus they wynnen more and more / and will not wisely spend their own /
neither thank god in due form till they be caught in the fendes snare. The sea belchith up much fylthe and castyth from it much corrupcyon / and that is
full abhomynable and lothely to look upon.

And in this world is lechery that defouleth body and soull / Lechery
it tourneth the precious temple of god into the lodge of grysely deuylles /
the people that haunteth this wretched syn ben maden as bestes without law /
and in this bestely co^dicyon they fyghten as bestes without reason / and there
they walken and twynen away all lothsumly to god and man. The sea fell sythes
with his great tempests drowneth man and also vessels / and loses them or
they come to land.

Glotony.
And in this world is glotony that drowneth the wits of the people till that
they be unreasonable and can not know when they have wrong. Certes excess of
meat and drink sleyth many mo than does the sword. For in diverse meats and
drynkes gredyly taken at meals is none heal but sickness / as the wise man
says / both body and soul / we must espy to fle these perelles that been in
this grievous see / and draw this net in water of wisdom by virtuous living to
the haven of health with cords yt ben of very mekenes / with patience / and
with long abydyng / saylynge with love and charity in holy speed and good
occupacyon / largynge our hands i^ deeds of mercy and pity yt poor nedy may
be our bedmen / ledyng our life in discrete measure / in what yt we shall take
or leave / clad in clennes and chastity. Math. 28. Ero vobis^m vsquam ^d
co^su^ma^ionem secu^.
And than shall Christ be al our comfort where ever we be by land or water as
he has grounded by his gospel Mat. 28. saying I shall be with you in well and woe
/ till this world be brought to an end. The fysshes swymmen in this water be all the people that be in this world both good and yuell in every degree / of each
state or dignyte. But as the great fysshes eaten ye small so mightty rich men
of this world deuouren the poor unto ye bare bone eating the morselles that
the best lyketh / as the wise man says Eccle. ^3. The huntyng or the pray of
the lion is ye fylde as in wilderness / so the fedynge of rychemen ben poor
nedy. And when the son shyneth warm in a merry season the great fysshes
drawn nyghe the air / and driven down ye small / and if there come any hayle
/ storm or any cold weder these great fysshes fallen to ground / and putten
above the small. So when rich me^ seen any worldly wynnyg they risen hye above
the clouds in vauntyng of their riches / and also lacken the simple co^myns
and seye that they may not pay / wherefore do they entermete them / they ben
but very beggars / but when there co^- a charge to the country / as taxis or
any other payment / than the rich man fallyth down and fayneth him self nedy
/ and magnifyeth the poor man that wonneth beside them saying / he is a preuy
man / and hydeth much riches. And thus says almighty god by the prophet
Abacuc. 1. The prophet says i^ spirit how rich e^m wasten the poor nedy /
he takes ye voice of great moan and makes his mournyng to his god. Lord what
shalt suffer men to be made as fysshes that swymmen in the sea / and as they
were crepyng bestes that have no leder here in earth / and judgment is made ye
crueller / and agaynseyng the mightyer / wherefore the law is al to torn / and
judgment comes to no perfyt end / for naught has the wicked wretch might
/ to overcome the wise man / and therefore passes forth among mankind
weywarde judgment that distroyeth peace / but for that fysshes ben right
quyuour and quycke in plenty of the water / and dreden not the hydeous waves /
whether they risen hye or low. In this place they shall be taken as to syanyfye
the true believe of man's heart. And to this wit spekith Christ in his
gospel and steryth us to pray. Luce. 11.
Luce. 11. For sothe (says Christ) which of you asks my father a fysshe /
whether now shall he give them for a fysshe an adder? nay plainly. Chrysostom
says upon this text / that this fysshe is man's faith / and after this we
should pray to our father that is in heaven that he would stable us in true
believe and in the articles thereto / for than we shall be dysposed in the water of
tribulacyon to do and suffer as pleasith god ioyenge for this believe / and
though there seem peryls of death I conscience shall nothing abasshe / for
socour is kept for all faithful in the tresure of Christ's passion. The fysshers
that drawn this forsaid net are sent before ye dome / that shullen weyghtly do
gods message and bring all folks by fore the face of godallmyghty in to the
vale of Iosophat. Iohel. 3.
Iohel. 3. The lord god says that he shall gather to geder al folks and he
shall led them into the vale of Iosophat / and there he shall make with them a
ryghtwyse reckenynge upon his people / Israel / that is his own heritage / and
than shall Christ with his saints depart the ill from the good Christ
chesith the good of his church into the vessel of blys / but the uyel are
casten out into the chymnye of fire there shall be weeping for bytternes of smoke
/ and gnastyng of tethe for quakynge of cold.

Of discrecyon to know good from yuell. Cap. ix.
NO man descriuith these two parties veryliche from other wandrynge in this
second church / for lykenes that they vsen / and also they have in common
many heavenly things. For our lord has in his church / laborers about his
vynetre / both fasters / prayers / and also wakers / almysdoers ben in this
church / with preachours / and reders of lessons / and syngers trauelen here
also / with ministers of sacraments with studyers in gods law / and men
that maken love days / and like servants has the fend in the third
church / but they do their service in a strange manner / nevertheless they ben
hard to know. Therefore we shall mark them how wonderfully they varyen in
these foresaid conditions / certes / fasters in Christ's church absteyne them
from lusts for to temper the coragis of the rebel flesh and keep their body
clean / chaste / and subject to there soul. For sayncte Austyn techith this
lore. Thy body leuyth of thy soul / the soul has her living of the god /
the body lives ryghtfully after the soul when the soul lives after god /
god is our sovereign good / and our soul a great good: that lives bytwext the
sovereign good / and our body a little good for it is gods creature / therefore
it is cleped a little good / forsothe the soul is not debytrice to live after
the flesh / but even on contrary wise ye flesh must need be mortyfyed / and
when thou leuest soul desires than thy flesh is mortyfyed. This is the deed
yt we shall do. This is the office of our knyghthode. Austen.
Thus says Austen. But fasters i^ ye sendes church fasten for vngrou^ded
causes. Some fasten for ipocresye and shows them rufull to the people such
Christ blames by his gospel and clepith them sorrowful hypocrytes Math. 6.
Math. 6. Cum ieni^atis nolite ^eti sicut ^pocrite ^istes.
For all the vain praysyng of man's mouth they have received all their mede.
Some withdrawn from their womb both mete and drink / to spare their purse.
And Gregory says that this fasting is for their sachell / and not for god /
and this is a careful fasting to pain our flesh and lose our mede as the
wise man says Eccle. 6. Eccle. 6.
He saw under the son a another yuel that is full ryue and commen among the
people / a man that god has given riches with catell and much worship / and
nothing fails his life of all that he desyeryth / but then wantyth grace and
power to eat or to take his part thereof / but a man that is a stranger shall
devour hit after his day / but this is a vanyte and great wretchedness. Some
fasten for a medycyne to get them bodyly health / neither for god nor for their
soul / but for to cleanse their beawtye. Jerome.
Saynct Ierom blames this fasting / and says. Abstynence of body is clear to
god when the mind fastethe from vices what profytyth hit to tere the body
with hungre when the mind within swells with pride. what fasting is this to
withdraw / lyflode and to be wode in envy or fool hastyte. God says by the
prophet Ysaye. Lo when ye fasten ye make strife and debates among your
selfs. This is not the fasting that I chose say the god the Lord / and
sythen the fend never eatythe ne drynkyth / neither is lapped in precious
clothes / yet he shall be ever in pain for them lackyth charity. Than is this an
euydence / that all such fasters been members in the fendes church in
following theer fathers prayers that been in Christ's church prayeng with
devotion / with all their strength of heart and of mouth / according /
knocking with a perfyte deed / after help of god / of mercy and forgyuenesse
of time myspended / and after grace and governance for time that is present /
and for good contynuaunce of time that is to come / fresshely bringing to
mind the kyndenesse of their god / how he has ruled them in this life / and
kept them from myschyefe as though he had no mo but one / so he saves all
that louen them. That they thynken of foul sins and feel that they have done
both wyttyngly and wylfully against gods will they have been recheles on his
services and that them rueth sore / and when they thinken on this world how
suddenly it passes / and of the tourmentes of hell / that dampened souls shall
suffer / and on the bliss that god has ordained for his true servants
anon they fynden a washing well that spryngeth from their heart and renneth
forth from their eyes by many warm stremes / Gregorye.
as Gregorye says. Than we fynden rendles of waters / when we wepen for all
our sins to wasshe clean both body and soul / and cleanse the^ from
corrupcyon. But prayers in the fendes church maken much noise / mumlynge with
their lyppes they rekkenen what / so that men praise fast their feigned
occupation as Christ says in his gospel. This people worshyppeth me with their
lyppes / but their heart is far away from me. Lord when thy body is in the
church and thine heart be in the world or cumbred with unclean thoughts and
with fantasyes / and thy tongue with mynstrelsy on lewd iangelynge / and thy
wit overcome with seculer needs. Art thou not then wrechydly dyuyded in thy
self. Saynct James says. James.
Suppose not this vain man / that he may take any thing of the lord / he may
in no wise be herd in prayer that suffers his heart to sleep in sin / and
efte god says by Ysaye in general words to wicked sinners. wha^ ye have
multiplied your prayers I shall not here you graciously / and the cause why is
thus / for your hands be full of blood / that is / your works be full of syn /
that partyn you and me atwyne / thus says the lord god / but wete ye welye
vycyous prestes that gone from the lord in vycyous living and will not follow
his holy steps but tarynge them from day to day / therefore your prayers ben
dispysed as Christ says yt can not lie. Mat. 24. Mat. 24.
woe to you scribes and pharyses ypocrites that eaten the houses of wedowes by
long prayers for this thing ye should take the larger judgment. Upon this
says Crisostome / the sleyght or the wyles of ypocrytes women may not only
know / and because of their relygyon / they will sone bow to the^ for they be
nesshe. This doctor makyth two specyal causes why they drawn to wydowes
howses. One is for women yt ben wedded and under the power of man's danger
dare not give these worldly goods wtouten counsel of their husbands. And
other wedowes ben full of pyty / to give when they be petiously asked / and have
no man to werne the^ this deed for her good is at her own will / and for this
end / these flaterynge glosers most haunten wedowes howses. Christ wyssheth
them woe / and warns our prestes that they forsake this synneful manner / for
it is a cursyd deed to hyde sin under painted relygyon / and clothe wyckednes
under ypocresye / till it be trowed for very pety / and in the armor of Ihu^
Christ. They done the fendes works of hell / when they largen there long
prayers as nets that been sprede abroad and with craft they catchen away
the goods of these sely wydowes. These wydowes we should understand / both
for woman and for me^ that wanten wisdom of Jesus Christ / yt which is spouse
of man's soull. For Jesus now here delytyth but in them that louen his law.
wakers that been in Christ's church / waken in virtue and devout prayers / and
auoyden all dyuyses for they will not be negligent / but holden and waken there
inward eye that faithfully sees the works of god / and then rises up. As
sayncte Paul says. A new man fourmed after god / and shines them in these
three virtues / rightwysenes / truth / and holiness. This is waking to gods
worship and to their own salvation / and to profit of their even christen.
For thus means Paul in these.iij. words. This watch so chaseth ye fend yt
he flees from all such wakers / and has no might for to noye body ne soul /
as the wise man says. The wholesome watch of honesty shall make the flesh
melte from syn / and busy thought in this fair watch shall drive away unlawful
dremes. Certes the thought of the fore knowing turns away the wit from syn
and a great infirmite makyth a sobre soull. But wakers in the fendes church
vsen a foul flesshly watch / for ever they ben slombryng when any good deed
is gone / and is overcome with sleep / yt brings them to myschyefe / for ye
wyseman says. How long shall thou sleep thou shlowe man / when shall thou
rise from thy sleep? Thou shall nappe a little while / thou shall slumber a
little while / thou shall knyt thy hands to geder till thou fall into dead
sleep / and than shall come to the need / as a wayfayrynge man and pouertye
shall stele to the as an armyd man / nappynge / and slumbrynge / and daed sleep
ben ye fendes officers. Than men nappen when they co^senten to do the fendes
stirynge / and when they wyrchen openly yt the fend desires in ye sight of
the world / than they ben in slombrynge. But when they maynteyne boldly what
ever they done amys / than they ben in deed sleep / and waken in their sins /
changynge the night unto ye day / as horys and thieves trauelyng from place to
place to revel and to rout / assayeng where with yt they may leave tokenes of
their syn. Almesdoers in Christ's church releuen i^ due time with the plenty of
their catel them yt suffren need as saynct Paul says. Look yt your
habundau^ce fulfill the need of other / for ye thus doing shallen receive the
blessyng of god / as ye prophet says. Blessed be he that takes head on ye
nedy and poor. Upon this says Bernarde. Not upon the covetous man and the
proud / but upon ye nedy and poor / that is to wit / those that asken
constrained with need / and taken thyr alms with shame geuyng thanks to god
and live poorly thereby. In four things gods servants medefully done
their alms. First / they seken gods will and done it to his worship. The
second of true gotten good clearly in their conscience. The.iij. yt they know
their brother live in gracious life. The.iiij. yt he suffers need wtouten any
fayning for if any of these faylen / they lose both good and mede. But
almysdoers in the fendes church feden many wretches / as strong styffe
beggars yt strykes over ye land / and groners without cause than neden not of
their good / ye to mynstrels iuglers and other vain iapers / that they delen
largely their goods to and cleppen it an alms / but true men seeing all a
mys goods thus spended / for it draws them to heaven / as a boket into the
well / and if they do any thing there as need is / anon they seken vain
glory: and lose all there mede. Isedor
For saynct Isodor says. when the poor man is fed because of vain glory
than is the work of mercy turned into sin / as Christ says Luce. 11. if
thine eye ben aweywarde / all thy body shall be derke / thyn eye is thyn intent
that should rule thy conscience / and this body is thy work of intent takes
his light. Than it is thus to mean / when thine intent is not well ruled thou
getest no mede what ever thou do / prechours that been in Christ's church /
commen freely among the people as Christ came from the toure of heaven and gave
this charge to his discyples. Freely ye have taken your wisdom. Paul.
Freely give it again. Paul chose rather to be deed / than any man should
avoid his glory for mede that might be given or taken again the gospel of
Jesus Christ / and these preachours prechen to edifyethe people in virtues / as
Christ commanded on holy thursday to his discyples before the styenge /
Mathewe vltimo. Math. vltimo.
Ye going forth into all the world preche ye the gospel to each creature /
that is to each man that is chefely each creature / and they lyuen virtuously
them self after their prechynge / for to straight their holy words / with the
spirit of life / when they given a true ensample in deed after their saying /
and this is the techynge of Jesus Christ in the gospel of sayncte Mathewe. Look
your light shine so before men of this world / that they may se your good works
and gloryfye not you but your father that is in heaven / of whom comes all
your grace. But prechers in the fendes church prechen under color for to take
gifts. But Gregory reproves them saying. who so ever preche for goods of
this world or to make a gatheryng for such an heavenly office undoubtedly they
pryuen them self from the mede that is to come of everlasting reward / and
they prechen chronicles with poyses and dremynges and many other helpeles tales
/ that right naught auaylen. They clouten falshed to truth / with much
ungrounded matter tarynge the people from true believe that they may not know it
/ and these preachers waueren about in many flesshely lusts as Jude says.
Jude.
These ben spots in their meats / feastynge / and fedynge them self
withouten dread / worshyppynge the persons of men / for they would have
winning / reders in Christ's church reden holy lessons / and tenden to their
redynge with medefull deuotyon as Iierom says. So read thou holy wryt yt
ever thou have in mind yt tho words yt thou redyst ben gods law / yt
commanded it not only to be read / but also yt the readers should keep it in
their works: what profits it to read things to be done / and not to fulfill
them in deed? as a clean myrrour of life the lesson of holy wryt is to be read
and had / that all that is good / may be made better / and that this yuel may
be amended / and these reders reden dystynctly / yt is treatable and openly in
scripture withouten interrupcyon / or any faynyd intermission / without
corruptynge or ouerhippyng of letter / word / or syllable and they shall
accord in charity and do all things in order. But reders in the fendes church
Iangle their lessons as iayes chatteren in the cage / and wot not what they
mean / stryuing with them for naught each against other / for rules of there
ordynall and many vain questions / and if they understood the lesson when it
is read or any part of gods law / when it is declared sone they treden it
under the foot / and haten it in their works / as Jeremy the prophet says in
wytnessynge against all such / how may ye say (says Jeremy) we been wise
and the law / and the law of the lord is among us. Certes the false style
of the scrybes has wrought opyn lesynge / and your wise men / been confounded
and aferde / and cast in their own snare / they have thrown abacke the word
of the lord / there is no wisdom least among them / and efte god says by
Jeremy to the vein reders. Cursyd be he that does the work of god
fraudulently / that is to say-falsely or disceyuable. And here says Gregory.
Only in gods service that man do no fraud that wakyth full busyly in study
of good deed and neither boweth to medes of bodylye thing / nor seeks the
words of man's lewd praysynge / nor looks after the favor of a fowls
judgment. Syngers ben in Christ's church that syngen heavenly songs and with
their sweet melody pleasen god at the full / Paul.
as Paul says in his pystle to the Colo. Suffer ye the word of god to dwell
plenteously among you in all manner heavenly wisdom / encresynge you in virtue
/ techynge and monestynge your self / in psalms and ympnes and gostely songs
singing in grace with fervent devotion in your hertes to your god / and what
ever ye shall do in word or work do ye that thing perfytly in the name of our
lord Jesus Christ / yeldynge thankynges to the fader by the same Jesus Christ.
And sythen he is both god and lord and king of all the world. The prophet
Dauyd counseyleth us that we should sing wisely. For he that is occupied in
heavenly desires / though his tongue be still and make no noise. He syngeth a
song / says / sayncte Austyne / that lyketh god best. Austyn.
Ananye / and Azarye / and Mizael also so^gen blessed song to the lord in
such manner song when they weren in Babylon in the bournynge surneys. But
syngers in the fendes church broken curyous notes / and that is but a puff of
wind / As says sayncte Bernarde wisely / to please the people with lykerous
voice / and fill their ears with vein de^ne. But se what saint Gregory says
which accordith with saynct Barnard when fair and glosyng voice is sought /
parfyte life is forsaken / and the people is led into sin / Ezechi. 33.
as god says by his prophet / Ezechiel. 33. My people sytten before the and
heren thy words / but they do not after them / when there back is turned /
for the prestes turnen them in song of their mouth / and the hertes of the
people follow their prestes avarice / and is to them as a song of musyke /
that is songen busyly / and meryly with a lusty sound / and they heren the
sermons / but they kepen them not / says the lord god / and efte god says by
his prophet Amos. Amos.
Do away from me the pride of thy chauntynge / and I shall not here ye song of
thine harp. Lord what may this mean that prestes in their church give them
self this much to song / and so little to prechynge / and in few places or
none of the new testamente shullen we ground this manner of songs / neither
among our doctors / but efte they ben charged to preach / ye under great
pain / and all gates that they have good will to do that they may that the
people were truly taught to lead a sober life. Therefore Gregory in his decree
smyteth them with a curse that busyen them in the court of Rome about such
syngyng where should be used the office of prechynge / mynisters of sacraments
that been in Christ's church be thynken them full besyly of the great
worthynes. How these sacraments co^mmen of Christ / and of his holy passion
taken of his blessed body for treasour of his church / and they ben salve and
medycyne for all the sick members tha^ wol show their great sores / to gods
prestes of wise discrecyon / and use these sacraments in their kind. As
saynct Paul techeth Christ (says he) is offered our paske that noryssheth us
with his sacraments / and therefore make we us merry in this gostely food / not
in anger and tene of malice and wyckednes. But in the fair pured past of
clennes and of truth. These two virtues techen us to cleanse body and soul /
whether that we should give or receive ye seven sacraments / baptysme /
confermyng / penance / order / Christ's body / Matrymony / and ye last
anoyntynge. These helpen us in this fighting church again the seven dedly
sins / that been vij. cruel deuylles. The first is Lucyfer / that raignyth in
his malice / and rules over the children of pride. The second is called
Belzabub / that lordeth over enuyous. The third devil is Sathanas / and
wrath is his lordshyp. The fourth is clepyd Abadon / the slow ben his
retynewe. The fyfte devil is Mammon / and has under him the auarous and the
covetous. The syxt is called Belphagor that is the god of glotons. The.vij.
devil is Asmodeus / that ledeth with him the lecherous. But tho.vij.
sacrametes casten out these deuylles from the servants of god that receyuen
them medefully and stablen them in.vij. geftes of the holy ghost. But mynysters
in the fendes church mynystren these sacraments and treten them unworthily /
and al such both learned and lewd ben Judas gostely children / for he took the
sacrament at Christ's holy souper / where Christ dealed his body in bread / as
other aposteles dyden and drank with them his blood in wine / but with a
vicious conscience / wherefore the devil entered in them / and he betrayed his
lord. Thus it is with ye fendes children / when they receive the sacraments
they gone to them unworthily / and so to their dampnacyon. Some with polluted
hands and with a stynkynge careyne / as Parisens says / and rehersyth
Austyne. He that is on the night a lover of Lechery / and on the morrow a
sacrar of the vyrgyns son / god tourneth away his ears from such men's
prayers. Many faithful doctors forbeden straytly to take any sacraments of
such prestes hands / but now it is and ever shall be to the worlds end.
Fools fynden conuentycles that hasten them to hell / some that been as symondes
heirs / that sellen these sacraments / and some be ready with their money as
chapeme^ in afayre to bye of these marchans marcha^dyse / merit / as there wene
/ but both the buyers and ye sellers deserve endeles pain Some sayen / have
here my money for christenynge of my child. Some sayen / have here this money
and assoyle me of my sins. Some sayen / have here this money / and sing for
me a mass. Some sayen / have here this money for thou have made this marriage.
Some sayen / have here this money and sacra me to prestehode. Some sayen / have
here this money for thou haste often vysyted me. Some sayen / have this money /
and good sir pray for me. Some maken letters for soteller ypocrysye / to sell
all their suffrages where ever they find their chapemen that wol pay largely
therefore. Than is the bargayne made. Lord how studyen these fendes lemes ye
decre. Saluator? or gods law / or the Acts of the aposteles where such
marchandyse is dampened. For thus it is said of cursed Simon. Forsothe when
Simon Magus had seen that by touching of ye aposteles hands the holy ghost was
given to the people / he proferyd them money saying. Give to me also this power
yt who so ever I touch with my hands may receive the holy ghost. Forsothe
than said Peter unto him. Thy money be with the for us / take it thy self to
thy dampnacion for thou trowest the gift of god to be set to sale for money
/ there is no part ne lot to the in this sermon of god. Than these that we
have marked before in this ben the very heirs of Simon / for they wene when
they have money to grant to the people these gostely gifts / and Simon is
dampened and all his folowers: how much more these cursed takers? For if
saynct Peter had taken this money he had given leave to use symony. But Peter
forsook and blamyd this man / and put a rule that shall last / and cursethe
and dampneth both gyuers and takers for both parties been symonyake. Ones
Judas made a couenaunte with the Jews / for thryttye plates / and sold his
master / Jesus Christ / betrayenge his body into their hands when he came
chefely to dye / and his death was our redempcyon / therefore his name is cursed
Judas / and well worthy for his false train. But his children do much more
were that sellen the sacraments / and that for less price / that been vndedely
and mowt not suffer neither any profyt comes of ye sale / but vengeance here
or else where. Alas when woll these wretches be ware? Studyers in Christ's
church studyen day and night in the law of the lord / as the prophet says.
Blessed be that man that has his will in the law of the lord / for he shall be
as a tree that is wisely plantyd beside the course of waters that shall give
fruit in his due time / and his lefe that is his virtue / shall not fall away /
but all thing that he shall do / in grace shullen be welthy. well is them that
so may study to find these precious virtues / to make fair their own soul
with the flower of holy wryt. Than Christ will take his resting place in the
chamber of their consciences / for the wysema^ says. My flowers ben flowers of
worship and honestye. And therefore saynct Ierom / cou^seyleth in his prologe
upon ye bible. I pray the dear brother / Jerome.
says Jerome / that thou have thy study / and thy mind among the lessons
that been in holy wryt. Busy the nothing else to know. Busy ye nothing else
to seek / set thine heart in holy study / and pursue after with all thy might
and thou shall find it in short while more sweter than the honycomb as the
wysema^ says. Have thy thought in gods hestes / and in his commandments
be thou most busy / and he shall grant an heart to the / and a lust of
wisdom shall be given to the. But studyers in the fendes church / studyen in
their maden laws / all for riches and for pride and for their worldly worship.
Yea so ferforthe that uneath any man is fou^den that abides in gods law /
clean without medelynge / but draws them to man's law for that smatcheth
wynnyng / and their they studyen sad and sore. But at their last end this
shall be their payment / as god says by Jeremy. Jeremy.
Cursyd mote that man be that settyth his faith in man / and puttyth his trust
and strength in man's maden ordynaunces and suffers their heart to depart
away from his lord god. Certes this man shall be as a brom that grows in
wyldernes / and he shall not se in inward sight / when that good of the soul
shall come to them / but he shall dwell in drynes in the land of wyldernes /
thus says the lord god. Such men sclaundren Christ that is both god and man
and has hallowed his both laws with his precious death / and put in them the
spyryte of life by quyckenynge of his blood / to rere souls from death / and
bring them again to life as the gospel tells. Iohi^s. 11. Iohi^s. 11.
where Christ says. who so ever believes on me / yea though he be deed /
nevertheless he shall live again both in grace and glory. But this is not in
man's law that may give this power. Than is this afoule sclau^dre of these
wayward fools that thus studyen in man's law / and if it were the / and
therefore such froward thoughts departen their soul from god. Of al those
spekith Jeremy / and says of them full sharply. From the least unto the
most all studyen unto couetyse that is to understand of them that been in the
fendes church / far from the preacher all work gyfe / therefore they shullen
fall among them that fallen / they shall fall in time of vysitacyon says the
lord god. God rehersyth this sentence again / for we should take heed thereto.
But for they wol not amend their studyes / and turn their thoughts to god.
Therefore god wyssheth them woe / and says this by the prophet Mycheas. woe to
you that think ye thing that is unprofitable and wurchen evil in your studyes.
In ye morrow light / Peacemakers in Christ's church mouen men to rest / that
Christ behyte to his dyscyples when he was among them. Io. 14.
Iohi^s. xiiij. My peace (says Christ) I give you / my peace I leave with you.
His peace he left with us when he went to heaven / his peace he shall give us /
wha^ the world shall have his end / his peace he betoke us / to help us in
this world / his peace he granted to us / to solace us in bliss / he has
left us his peace to be our trusty clothyng / for if we be clade therein / we
shall overcome our enemies he shall grant us his peace / and we shall be suer to
reign without end / without any enemies / he has left us his peace / that we
deem not falsely of our neighbor in things that been uncertain / he shall
give to us his peace / when he shall make open the preuytees of man's heart /
and than shall be praysynge to every man of his god / after he has deserved.
Christ has left among us peace / that we should love togeder / hatynge
sin and loving virtue / for thus he loved us / for there is no charity / but
if sin be hated and rented up by the roots in us and in all other / than
shall Christ give us full peace / where we may never dyscorde. Thus says
sayncte Austyn upon the same gospel / that is before rehearsed. Now ground we
it in our mind / these Peacemakers for they would have this very peace among
them standen armed at all pecys for dread of their enemies / in ye armor of
Jesus Christ. That saynct Paul techeth to the Ephesyans / in ye syxth chapter
/ where he rehersyth six armours that armen the soul / five for to defend /
with the syxt for to assail. The first is a gerdle of chastity / and thereby
may we know that Paul vsyth the wit of the soul / and leueth bodyly armor.
This gerdle gerdeth up in their hynden and saves chastyte and peace / and the
body from Lechery in these three degrees. In maidens / it kepyth virginite / in
wedded true matrimonye / in wydowes co^tynence / yt is from bodyly uncleanness.
Take ye this gerdle in gods name / yt ye may standen profit in ye peace of
your soul again al flesshely stirrynges. The second armoure is an haberyon of
ryghtwysnes that is thykke mayled for falshoode should not enter for to grieve
god or man / or trouble this true peace. The third Armoure is a leg harneys
and shoynge of affectyons in the gospel of Jesus Christ / and than they ben
dysposed to make peace among men / not as the world askyth / but that they
stand sure and perfytely in all aduersyte with Christ and his gospel / to the
death day. The fourth armor is a shield of faith in which they shullen quench
all the fendes brenning darth / that been his temtacyons. Certes there may no
dedly dyntes stele in that man that has the shield of true believe hanging in
his heart. Therefore he ledyth his life in peace and quarte from al gostely
syckenes. The fyfte armoure of the soul is an helm of health that is cleped
trusty hope / for it berethe of strokes that ye fend throwith at man's soul
with two dispicious gynnes. THe one is obstynacyon or hardenes of heart. The
other is desperacyon or else wanhope. But who that has the helm of hope /
though strokes lyghten on them they shall in no wise braste this palet ne
synke into the soul / therefore he lyuethe peacebly in hope of gods mercy.
The syxt armoure of gods knights with which they done assail / is the
sword of the spirit that is gods word / with this sword Judith the wedowe
smote Holofernes / and cut his heed from the body in saving of her people. And
in this sword Ihu^ Christ assailed the fend of hell. when Christ said. Go
Sathanas / anon he fled away. For this sword is full sharp and byteth on
both sides / for it partyth at one stroke ye soul and body a sondre / and it
departyth in this life virtue from sin / and it shall depart at domesday ye
good from the yuel / in this sword king Solomon gave true judgment and
dyuyded truth from the falshode. God give us grace to take this sword of
king Solomon with Iudyth / and with Jesus Christ / and than their is no doubt
/ for all that taken this sword and stand on this armor / Christ our captain
blessyth them and clepyth them his children. Mat. 5. Math. 5.
Blessed be al these peace makers (says Christ) for they shall be cleped the
sons of god. And efte Christ says Love ye your enemies / do ye well to them
that haten you / and pray ye for your pursuers and your sclaunderers that ye
may be the sons of your father that is in heaven. But peace makers in the
fendes church confedre them to geder in a false peace / after the manner of this
world / yt Christ's gospel dampneth / where he says. I came not to maynteyne
vicious peace. But to send a sharp sword to smite sin from man's soul /
and this these synnefull wretches thrown under fete / faith / troth / and
rightwysnes they counten at no price for they over leden the country after
their own lust. Therefore the prophet David sorowith on this myscheue. I have
(says he) sorowed on wicked men / seeing the peace of sinners / but Prestes
and knights of this some ben most to blame. Prestes.
Prestes that should be gostely leches and reconsyle the people by good
counseyle to their god and hele them with his law / what with couetyse and
many flesshly lusts these prestes ben so blinded that they know no wisdom /
for Job asking this question. Job.
where wisdom may be found anon he answeryth with ye spirit of god / Gregory.
not in the land of lusty lyuers. And upon this says Gregory in his
Moralles. These words of great sorrow to them that been gylty. who that is fed
with plesures or lusts of this present life without any doubt that man is
departed from the understanding of everlasting wisdom. And sithen these
prestes be given to this flesshely lusts they faylen gostely sight and and
wisdom / to ransake any gostely syckenes or to search about the perell of a
wound / and yet they ben presumpteous to profer false medecyne / and undertake
great cures for to make men hole / but they hurten them much sorer than they
were before / as ye lord moves by his prophet Jeremy. Jeremy.
These prestes helydden the contrycyon of my people with shenshyp or with shame
/ that is with foul symony as we rehearsed aforne. And they sayen. Peace /
peace / when their was no peace / they ben worthy to be spent yt have done
abhominacyon much rather in this cofasyon they ben not confunded / for they
have not ben ashamed of their own felony. Thus says the lord god / and efte
he says from the preachours that comes defoulynge upon all the earth. These
things says ye lord will ye here the words of these preachours yt prechen
and desceyuen you. They speken ye visyon of their heart / but not of ye lords
mouth / they sayen to tho that blasphemen me. The lord spekyth that peace
shall be to you / and they have said to each man that walkethe in shrewdnes of
his heart their shall come none ill upon him. And Gregorye says. Gregory.
Yuyll prestes ben cause of ruin and decay of the people / and no wounder for
wha^ the light is quenched that should shine in prestes / tha^ is their much
stynke with wickked favor / and blyndnes that cumbrith ye leder and the
follower into the derkenes of hell as ye gospel wytnessyth. when the blind
ledith the blind / fall they not tha^ both into the dyke or lake? yes plainly.
The former blind is ye pressed yt wantith understanding / for you have the
lettryne and fail in good living / than he is a blind pressed of whom Christ
spekith / as the commen gloss says / about naught he bostith the knowing of
gods law yt distroyeth ye lore with his wicked works. The other blind is man
and woman yt trusten in such prestes to lead them in the way of life / and
bring them to salvation. But Christ has iuged both these parties to fall into
ye dungyon. Of such prestes comes debate in all the world yt distrobleth very
peace and cries open vengeance. And these prechours ben no prechours but only
in name / as a luschborne is clepid apeny and is naught worth. Knights.
Knights also ben to blame yt mysusen their power and will not read is gods
law neither learn their office. And therefore ye wysema^ blames the^ saying.
Here ye knights and understand ye knights for power is only of the lord and
strength comes of them that is highest that shall ask rekennynge of all your
works / and shall search fully the inward of your thoughts. For when ye were
mynysters of gods realm neither ye demed ryghtfully / neither kept ye his
law / neither ye walked in the way after gods will / but ye strayed all away
as if it were wild lions / in oftyn taking of much meat that styryth you to
much drinking / than ye lyggen long in cowchis that draws you to Lechery /
and sometime to spousebreche and other foul uncleanness / and of this commethe
stryuynge and fyghtyng ever anon that brings you to enmyte and hate of each
othere. How should ye knights maynteyne peace when ye forsake it in your
self / for with your grievous tirannye oppression and extorcyon your awe is
law. who dare say nay / but as ye woll your self. But wete you well this is
the voice of them that shall be dampened as the wise man says. Our strength / our
power / be it to us the law of ryghtwysnes. Here ye therefore how dredfully it
folowith ye sentence said before if that ye will not amend you. Ferefully and
sone it shall show to you that most hard judgment shall be to them that lorden
or that holden lordeshype over poor brethren / mercy is granted to them that been low in heart mighty men mighty shullen suffer turmentry / forsothe the
Lord shall not withdraw the person of any man neither he shall be ashamed of any
man's greatness / for he has made both small and great / and chargith ne
one ne other / forsothe to the stronger is made stronger crucyacyon in pain.
Thhese forsayde prestes and knights through such vicious deeds leden ye
commennes on their ring / and bolden them in sin / so that all this world
is set in error in battle and in war. But now be common to the priest the
words that god has said by the prophet Jeremy to teach his chosen
servants. Jeremy.
Al these ben aduolterers and a company that breken the law / they have
stretched forth their tongue as a bent bow to shut lesynge and no troth /
each man at other / they ben comforted in the earth / for they gone from yuell
to yuel / and they have not known me says the Lord god / each man from his
neybour keep them self full wisely / and in his own brother he may have no
trust / for each brother in dysseyte shall begyle othere / and the man shall
scorn his brother and they shall not speak truth / forsothe they have taught
their tongue to speak lesyng / and for they would done wyckedly they have sore
traueled / they have forsaken in treachery to know me / says the lord god /
wherefore these things says ye lord of hosts. Lo I shall well them to geder
/ and I shall prove them / what shall I else do / from the face of my people
an arrowe wou^deng is their tongue / for it spekyth gyle / and he spekyth with
his friends / peace with his mouth / but pryuely he lays for him spies to
disceue them. Now whether shall they not vysyte upon these things says the
lord god or shall not my will be venged upon such a folk? as if he would
fa^e. I shall be venged / for as their will is to go from me so my will is to be
venged upon the^ when I se my time / but happily here some woll say god woll
not take vengeans on his christen people / god woll not lose that he dear
bought with his precious blood. To the first we answeren by the mouth of god.
Iere. 16.
Jeremy. 16 your fathers (says he) have forsaken me / and gone after gods
for to do them service / and worship them also / but they have forsaken me and
not kept my law. But ye also done much werse than ever wrought your faders.
Lo each of you walks after the shrewydnes of his evil heart / that he here
not me says the lord god / and I shall cast yrou away out of this earth /
into a land that is unknown to you and to your fathers and there ye shall do
avarice to alyen gods that shall give no rest neither night ne day. And to ye
second we answeren as Christ says in his gospel. Friend how entrest thou
hither not having thy brydale clothes / and he waxt domb. Than this king Jesus
Christ said to his mynisters. Take this wretch / bounden hand and foot and
send him into uttermost darkness / their shall be weeping and gnastynge of tethe
/ understand thou by this / friend / both man and woman that has taken
christendom / and holdethe the name / but they wanten in their living the
works of treue believe therefore Christ wardeth them in to the pain of hell.

How ye good of ye second church accordyth with the first church. Ca. x.
HEre shall we tell how the good of the second church accords with the first
church appropred to god / Faith / Hope / and Charity / as we have said
aforne knytten togeder god and man in one heed of this church. This knotte is
knytte so sekyrly that it shall never more fail neither here ne else where as
the wyseman says. The three fold cord is full lothely burston. For to make
this three fold cord we must have three lynkes / and eke the^ forth perfyte
till this cord be wrought / by which this church shall be drawn unto the holy
Trynite. These ben the first three / a chaste body / a clean soul / and gods
truly dysposed than it shall be eked with good holy thought and a perfyte deed /
more over we must large forth shryfte of mouth sorrow of heart / and amends
making / after this it askyth prayer / fasting / and almysdede / than must we
put to / nombre / weight / and mesure. Also we must eke this word with mind /
will / and reason / and help forth to the end with Faith / Hope / and Charity
/ than we shall neyghe to our god thorough grace / mercy / and ryghtwysnes /
till we se god in Trynite / Fader / Son / and holy Ghost. Every member of this
church helpith / yt it may to wyrche one part of this cord for the common
profit as sayncte Austen says. Holy church is a ferme of all ryghtwysenesse
/ that is to say a comen accord of al good things and this church prayethe
in commen / and wyrcheth their works in common. For without felowshype of this
general church baptism may not profit neither the deeds of mercy / but it
be that the pains of hell be less / all the members of a man trauelyn in
their order each for to socoure othere / none for to hyndre / but for to do
their co^myn help to the profit of the body. Thus it is of the members that been in Christ's church / for it is a godly body that growith with their
members / their one fails an othere helps till the cord be made. Some have
much of wisdom / to know holy wryt. Some have fair eloquence to preche it
to the people. Some have much of gostely strength to suffer tribulacyon. Some
have pety and releuen their nedy neybours Some tenden vertuosly to minister
sacraments. Some styen hyely to rest in heavenly things or lykynges / but all
such things ben in common to them that shall be saved / as the prophet says.
Speaking in the person of the general church. Lord I am partener of all them
that fere or dreden the / and of all that keep thine holy commandments. Thus
teaches also the commen creed in an article of the says yt must need be
granted which is / the communion of saynctes. For what that ever be done in
Rome or in any other places / if that thing be couenable in the sight of god /
than it is couenable to all these members that seruen god in virtue to help
them to their endelesse joy as we have said before / Jerome.
herto accordyth saynct Jerome upon this text of Christ's gospel. Math. 16.
Math. 16.
Christ said to Peter and in him to all his folowers / to the and to all such
as thou art I shall give the keys of ye realm of heuennes is this church here
in earth. Jerome.
Ierom says / and the master of the sentence reherseth this. All mynisters of
the church in bysshopes and prestes have the judiciary power as saint Peter
had / but therefore Peter special took of god this power that all men may
understand that who so ever departs them from unity of steadfast faith and
fellowship of this church / he may neither be assoyled from bonds of his sins
neither he may enter into ye bliss of heaven. Se now here both leryd and lewd
how prayers ben in co^myn and all other suffrages to this gostely church.
whence comes tha^ this out cry that is set on broch / sale / kene / in every
church to sell these gostely things with suffrages and soyleme^tes / and many
years of pardon? and a plenarye indulgence A pena et culpa / but much rather it
should be said / a glory et pecunia. Certes they come from byneth of the
fendes temptynge and ben borne all about of his cursyd members / to poison the
people in mysbeleue as saint Ierom says and part them from gods fellowship
by witness of saynct Austen / and drive them to their endeles pain / as we
have said aforne.

Of joy in tribulacyon. The.xi. chapitre.
But for that we repreue these sins this yuell part grutchyth and pursues
with strong hand to prison and to slay / therefore must we learn this lore of
Christ's holy gospel. Math. 5. Ye ben blessed when men have cursed you / Math.
5.
and have pursued you / and have said all yuell against you lyeng for me /
joy ye and be ye merry / for your mede is much in heuennes. And also saynct
Peter says. when that ye suffren any thing for ryghtwysnesse. Blessed mote ye
be / saint Paul affirms this sentence yt gods servants shullen have pain
in this life to keep them in virtue. 2. Thimo. 3. All that ever wol live mekely
in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecucyon. Luke.
And saint Luke says of ye words of Paul in deeds of ye aposteles. Act. 14.
By many tribulacions it behooves us to enter into the realm of god. And thus
says the prophet. Many ben the tribulacions that fallen to the ryghtwyse and
fro them al / when time comes god shall deliver them. Christ behyght the manner
of life / to his own discyples / and gave them comfort that they should have
a gracyous delyuerance for than shall bliss be much the sweter when they
common thereto. Io. 6.
Io. 6. Truly I say unto you ye troth / that ye should sorrow and weep /
forsooth the world joy / and ye should be full heavy / and after this your
heaviness shall be turned into joy / and your joy shall be sekyr that no man shall
take it from you / and for this joy should savor well to them that been his
lovers he sendith them tribulacion / as saint Gregory says. God shewith to
his chosen / sharpenes in this journey / lest by hap if they delyted them in
this dedly way / they might forgeyte things that been in ye heavenly country /
tribulacions yt brisen us down in this wretched world / they constrayne us to
go to god / that they lightly might be dampened / for ye eyes that sin closyth
/ pain makes open / and many that haunten theft with many other sins if
they were lame blind / or crooked of gods visitacyo^ they should cesse and
serve their god / and do penance full trewly as Crysostome says. Omeli. 3. The
soul is a spirit (says he) and dredeth spu^all pains of the flesh. And
therefore saynctes dyspysen the pains of this world / and dread ye last
judgment where spyrytes ben tourmented / forsothe the flesh can not dread
gostely pains to come / but he dredith in this life to suffer any pains /
therefore ye yuel cessen not to do syn / but if judgment of the flesh
constraynen them to be still and for this cause ye lord shall send upon his
servants sore punysshyng to their flesh and other tribulacions. The lust of
ye flessh may be sweled from ye coveting of yuell. we must need break the nut
if we will have the cornell we must needs suffer travel / if we desyren rest.
So must we needs suffer pain if we will come to bliss. He is a false cowarde
knight / ye flees and hydeth his head when his master is in ye field beten
among his enemies / but our lord Ihu^ Christ was be^en of the Jews / and
after dyed in the field on the mount of Caluarye to pay our raumsome / he took
his death for that he was nothing gylty / and his body when it was offered /
made at the full for redempcyon of mankind. Therefore the wyseman says. Eccle.
20. Forgete thou not the kyndenes of thy borowe / forsothe he has given for
the his life. This borowe is our lord god that without mede came from heaven in
to this world to borowe his people / and in taking of flesh and blood of
the virgyn mary / he showed us grace and kyndenes both in word and wyrchynge.
But in geuynge his life / he leyd his body in pledge / yea to the death he woll
not spare to suffer extreme pain / so much he loved his people / if that
faith be in us this may not be forgoten. Some forsaken sins and suen Christ
in virtue and this is a great kindenes / though they styen no hyer. Some do
wake in abstynence and studyen holy lessons / this is than a greatter kyndnes
/ if thou fle from syn. Some ben ready when they ben called of the holy ghost to
suffer death for Jesus Christ / and wytnes of his law / and when they have
cle^nes in living / this is the greatest kyndenes as the gospel shows. Io.
15. Io. 15.
A greater love or charity may no man have than to lose his life for his
friends soul / we were dear and leffe to god when we took the baptysme / but
we have much dear worthyer when we done the works that god has bydden in his
law without any grutchynge / and if we maynteyn this (...) not go therfro /
neither become rennegates for ye pains yt may fall / but think on Christ's
passyo^ that swageth al heaviness / tha^ we ben most dear worthy / and worthy
highest merit / and therefore saynct Paul says to the Galathies. Fere be it to
me / to make any glory but in the cross that is the passion of our lord Jesus
Christ / by whom this world is crucyfyed to me / and I am crucyfyed to the
world. Some ben not crucified to the world / but the world is crucyfyed to
them / for they despisen the world / but the world not them. Some ben
crucyfyed to the world / but not so the world to them / for though the world
despysen them / they dispysen it not again. Some ben neither crucified to the
world / ne the world to them / for neither they dispyse the world / ne the
world them. In the first degree were the apostels. And in the second degree
ben other good lyuers. But in the third and fourth degree / been tho yt should
be dampened / and therefore we should understand that some suffren pain for to
save the people / and so did Jesus Christ / when it might not save the^ self /
and showed his great kyndenes. Some suffren pain to purge them of their sin
that they have done i^ time before / and cryen god mercy. Some suffren pain to
keep them from syn that they should be combryd with if no pain were / but some
suffren pain for they haunten syn / and for they maken none end. Join than
the cross of Christ unto our bare flessh / that our part may be founden
among these holy saints that wylfully forsook them self / and ioyed in
trybulacion as saynct James says. Ia. 1. My brethern hope ye all joy when ye
have slyden among diverse temptations knowing that ye proving of your faith
/ wyrchyth patience / forsooth patience has a parfyte work / that ye mow be
perfect / in soul and hole in body / and in nothing faylynge.

Of the fendes cautyles by the which he pursues in his members the kepers of
gods commandments. Ca. xii.
THe yuel part of this church shall never cesse with the malice that they may
to pursue good leuers: but for his chosen children god shall abregge the days
of there wodenes and yt shall men well know as John^ says to ye church and
geuith it good comfort. Apo. 2. Dread thou not tho things which thou art for
to suffer / Lo ye devil is for to send of you i^ to pryso^ / and ye shall have
tribulacion ten days by dene: be you faithful to ye death / and I shall give ye a
crown of life / he yt has ears of heryng / here he / what the spirit says
to ye churches / who yt has ouerco^me^ / shall not be hurt of ye second death /
understand you by this devil all ye cursyd people yt shall pursue good lyuers
unto the worlds end / sometime more / sometime less / with diverse pains of
tourme^try / and understand thou by these ten days / ye ten commandments
for they ben light of man's wit / in ye derkenes of this world / as ye day
passith ye night in his clear shinyng. Of these ten commandments ye fend
fayneth his accion to troble the good of ye church and send them to prison /
and here it seems spedyer to tell ye fendes cautyles yt he uses in his
members against gods heftes / and as ye cloud in ye day so marrith he man's
wites. The first heft of god is this. Exo. xx. Math. xxij. Mar. xxiij. I am ye
lord thy god yt have lad the out of Egypt from the house of thraldom / before
me thou shall have none alyen gods / thou shall not make to the any graven
thing / yt is in heaven above nor in earth beneth or of tho things that been in
waters underneath I am the lord thy god a strong Ielous lover visytyng ye
wyckednes of fathers upon sons into ye third and fourth generation of the^
that haten me / and I doing merry into thousands to them that louen me and
kepen mine heftes. Again this commandment ye fend has leyde two snares /
and in them he catches ye people yt they may not escape: but either they must
grau^ten to his will / or else they should to prison The first is cleped
obedyens yt the fend chalengeth chiefly for to be done to him / or to his leef
tenauntes / as to prelates or to prestes that been his officers / and asken this
obedyence / what ever they co^mau^den / ye simple me^ obey to the^ / and hye
and low. All this world cries loud after this obedience: and sayen what ever
thy souerayn bids: you shall obey thereto. Here we grau^ten of believe yt we
owen obedyence to our soueraynes yt techen us to know god and dread him / ye
whether they that been ministers in the spu^all part or officers in the
temperalty / we must obey to them in that they obey to god / and learn us
obedyence / for thus is written. 1. Reg. 15. No whether will the lord brent
offerynges or sacryfyces / and much better it is to take to law tha^ to offer
ye fatnes of rams / for it is as the syn of wytchcrafte / to fight again god
/ and as ye felony of Idolatry: not to consent to gods word for this cause /
therefore that thou have cast away the word of the lord / the lord has cast
ye away that thou be no longer king. And to this the wyseman accords and
says. Much better is obedyence than sacryfice of fools / for yuell folks
wot not what they done. And saynct Paul teaches an open rule of this manner
of obedience with the cause of souerantye and knyttyth them both to geder. Obey
ye (says he) to your soueraynes and vnderlowte ye to them / and the cause why
/ is this. Forsothe they waken perfyttely as for to yield a reckoning for your
souls if this cause be taken away / obedyence cessyth there also as the
philosopher says / when the cause cessyth / the speed thereof shall also cesse.
But saint Peter teaches obedyence that we should done to lords and that in
more larger manner than we owen to ye clergy. Servants (says he) be ye
subjects in all dread to your temporal lords / not only to good and easy
lords / that is to say in love / but also to tyrants yt is to say in pacyence
/ but fendes lymmes faynen them to be on Christ's side and to do corrections
after Christ's will / and seyn / they ask obedyenee to amend souls when they
do this thing in deed that they here speken than we shall obey to them / and
else we shall answer as Peter said to prestes and bysshopes / of the law.
Act. 5. It behooves more to obey god than man. Sayncte Ierom says. Jerome.
If ye prelate or the Lord bydde any thing that accords with gods will /
obey thou then to them / if they bydde the contrary to god and to his law than
say thus / I must rather obey to the lord of the soul / than to the lord of
the body. For Christ says Mat. 10. and Luce. 12. Math.
will ye dread them that slain ye body / forsooth they may not slay the soul /
but rather dread ye him that may slay both body and soul / into hell / thus I
say to you dread ye him. And saint Gregory says. This foresaid rule of
obedyence shall be streytly kept. In children to their parents. In servants
to their lords. In clerks to there masters. In prestes to there prelates. And
if we pass this rule in doing of obedyence / than we were vnbuxum to god /
and folowers of Lucyfer. The second trappe of the fend is clepyd pylgremage /
but much rather it should be said the outrage of fools. For pylgrimage in
dew form is evermore good. The payntours makith an image forged with diverse
colors till it seem in foles eyes as a lively creature that is set in the
church in a solemn place fast bound with bonds for it should not fall.
Prestes of the temple begylen the people with the foul syn of Balaam / in
there open prechynge they sayen that gods power in wyrchyng of his miracles
lowyth down in one image / more than in a another / and therefore commyth and
offrith to this: for here is showed much virtue. Lord how dare these fe^des
for dread thus blaspheme their god and use the sin of Balaam that gods law
has dampened? Sithen Christ and his discyples forsoken this / the welthe of
this world and lyueden a poor life / as our believe techith: why gadren ye
prestes richesse with your painted images to make your self worldy rich in
spoylynge of the people / and yet ye done much worse / and for ye and your
consentours / thus doing been very Idolatrers / Paul.
as sayncte Paul says Corinth. 1. This people (says he) saying them self to
be wise / they been mad fools / for they have changed the glory of god that
may not be defouled / into the lykenes of man's image that may be defouled.
And Paul says when they knew the ryghtwysnes of god / they would not
understand that they that done such things been worthy of death / not only
the doars but also they that consenten to the yuell doers / for god says thou
shalt neither worship ne lowte them for thou shalt neither do sacryfyce to
image ne offering and that means god when he says / thou shall not worship
them with no godly worship / but / if they be painted truly as nigh as man may
to bring to mind as Gregory says the passion of Jesus Christ / Gregory.
and marterdome of saints as lewd men's books. But sayncte Austen says upon
all wise they have deserved to err that seken god not in books / but in
painted wowis / he also says thou shall not vow to these images / thou shalt
not seek these images / thou shall not swear by them / neither knele to them ne
kiss the^ / neither put faith / ne Hope / ne trust in one image / more than
in another / and thus menyth god when he says thou shall not loute them. But
true pilgrimage is done on.vj. manners. First we ben pilgrimmes when that we ben
borne / as the commyn gloss says upon Genesis. Every cytezyne of the heavenly
country is a pylgreme of this world / for all time of this present life / and
when we trauelyn sore to keep gods hestes tha^ we done our pylgrimage / as
the prophet says. Psalm. 118.
Psalm. 118. Lord thy commandments weren my songs in time of my pilgrimage.
The second time / we ben pilgrims when we gone to the church as it is
written. Luc. xxiiij. Luc. 24.
Tu solus peregrinus es in Jerusalem, etc, when we done in the church in
form as god has taught us / than we done our pilgrimage. For thus says
sayncte Luke. Luc. 2. Cum sanctus esset Jesus annorum duodecim. etc. The third
time we ben pilgrims / when we vysyte the nedye / and when we delen almysdede
/ we done our pylgrimage. Luc. xiij. Luc. 13.
Go thou forth anon into streets and ways and bring in to thine house these
three manner of people / poor feeble / poor blind / and poor lame. The fourth
time Prestes been pilgrims that studyen holy wryt till they have plenty in
their mind of this heavenly wisdom / and than they hyen them fast about in
all the broad world to dele this gostely treasour among the wyttles people
that is in point to spyll for hunger in wantynge gostly teaching as it is
written. Io. 4. Dear friend thou doste ryghtfully what ever thou doste into our
brethern / and namely into pylgremes that prechen the gospel / and been apayde
where they come with poor simple lyflode. The fyfte time tho ben pylgrymmes
that wonnen in a town where is neither priest ne lord to teache them / neither
to rule them / and than they gone unto the place where they may be taught and
ruled under governance. This is pilgrimage as it is written. Gene. 12.20. and.
26. There is no other pilgrimage that may please god out take this that we
have said / and all holy wryt berythe witness / for when the body is laid in
grave and the soul forth passyth to bliss or to pain wether that it be than
the syxte pylgremage is ended. The second commandment of god is thus. Exo.
20. Thou shall not take the name of thy god in vain. And Christ says in his
gospel. Math. 5.
Math. 5. Forsooth I say unto you / not to swear in any wise / neither by heaven
for it is the trone of god / neither by the earth / for it is the stole of his
feet / neither by Jerusalem for it is the cite of a great king / neither by
thine heed / for thou may not make a hear white or black / forsothe be
your word / ye / ye / and nay / nay / with heart and mouth according against
this commandment the devil in his members constraynen men to swear and leyen
there hands on books / and than he puttyth them to open shame / and if they
leave his byndyng he says by law they ben relapse / and than they shall be
brent. And this is an hydeous cloud upon this schynefull day to pain men for
keeping of gods commandments. For saint Austen says upon the gospel.
Christ has taught that thing that is of more perfection / that thing that is
of infyrmyte he has suffered: that thing that is superstycyous he has cut
away / it is of perfeccyon / not to swear in any manner / it is of infyrmyte for
to swear constrained / but it is of superstycyon to swear vaynly. For the
wyseman says. Sap. 14. Swerynge is no virtue but pain of sinners / either of
the^ that will not give credens / but if men swear / or else of them that
sweren withouten cause. And therefore Crisostome blames prestes for they
bryngen forth books / to compel men to swear upon them / and askyth this
question. whether is not he that settyth an house on brenning gylty of this
brennynge? whether is not he that brings a sword with yt which man slaughter
is done / gylty of this manslaughter? So they yt bryngen forth books on which
me^ forsweren them ben gylty of this swerynge / and he says. If the people
will say the sothe without any oath / whereto should they swear? And if they
supposen they would say false / why should they be compelled to forswere them
selfs? and the greatness of sin standyth greatly and chyeftly in such
ordynaryes / either secler or spu^all as this doctor proves / naught
exceptynge purgacion without such oaths / and of this sweryng comes wyckednes
/ and gods grievous vengeance / as the wyseman says. Aman much swerynge
shall be fulfilled with wickedness / and vengeance shall not go from his house.
Yet enmyes pursuen again this commandment / and sayen that Christ him self
swore / and his saints also. Swear by this book thou obstinate man or else
thou shall to prison / thou shall swear in our court because of thine
infyrmyte as saynctes has taught when thou art constrained to this we seyen
that Ihu^ Christ forbedyth on al wise sweryng by any of these.iiij. things yt
he him self reherseth / that is to say / heaven / or earth: Jerusalem / or by
thine own head / and wha^ these four ben out taken / with all yt is in heaven /
ye shall not ground your vicious sweryng / till that heaven befallen. To this yt
sayncte Austen says. Thou shall swear compelled / we grau^ten well a fore a
judge / if else me^ will not trowen us / but neither on books should we swear /
neither by gods creatures but after the form that god has taught by Jeremy
ye prohhete Jeremy. iiii. Thou shall swear. The lord leuyth in troth and dome
/ and rightwysnes. The lord lives is to mean / by god or by thine holy dome /
or by thy troth. Thus shall thou not swear but with three conditions. The first
is troth in the conscience of them that swerith without any gyle. The second
/ that it be done in dome / to exclude al manner of idle and vain swerynge. The
third that it be in ryghtwysnes / and in no manner of deceyte / ne hindrynge to
our neybour / ne dyscordyng to ye ryghtwysnes of god / but we may in no cause
swear by books / as we have said before / neither by lyfely creatures / as by
saints or by any such other. For the wiseman says Custom not thou thy mouth
to swear by names of saints for Chrysostom says. Omeli. 12. He that sweryth
by a creature / does ydolatry / he that swereth by creatures / synneth double
fold / ye though it war so / that sweryng were leful / ones / for he swerith /
a another time / for he makytst him self a false god / for what so ever it be
that a man sweryth by / yt thing he makes his god / lord how money me^ and
women maken the^ false gods / sythen welnye all this world has custom to
swear by one saint or by another. Certes these forsaid enemies ben cause of
this blasphemus sweryng / what with their sclau^dres and sometime with their
sore punysshing and freyl people cannot stand / but yield them to this fe^des
temptynges. The third commandment of god is this. Exo. xx. Have mind to
halowe thyn holyday. In six days thou shall wyrche and do all thine own
works / forsooth the seventh day is the saboth of the lord. Thou shall not do
any seruyle work. These syx shall keep this holyday. Thy son and thy daughter /
thy servant / and thyn hand maiden thy be / and thy stranger / yt is wtin
thy gates. In six days god made heaven and earth / and the sea / and al things
yt ben in the^ / and he in the.vij. day. Therefore god blyssed the day of the
saboth / and made it holy. Again this commandment the fend in his members
gives leave to chapeman to bye and sell. Ye within the sentuary / on the holy
sounday. And vytellers of the country holden commen marketes / yet se thou more
what sins a gaynste this hefte of god / great fayres of the year for the most
part ben set on the saboth day by the fendes council. God took full hydeous
wreche upon the children of Israel when they wrought seruyle work upon the
saboth day as it is written. Eccle. xxxj. Halowe ye my holyday / forsothe it is
holy to you who that has defouled it / he shall be deed / and he yt does any
seruyle work therein / his life shall perysshe from the mids of his people.
And so for gatherynge of styckes on the saboth day / a man at gods bidding
was stoned to the death. Therefore Nemias a man that dread god will suffer none
to bye ne sell on the saboth day within the gates of Jerusalem / ney there
about the walls / and charged all vytellers that they should cease / and if
they would not take heed they should feel his hands / for he thought for to
war on them as on gods enemies / but if they would obey to god in halowyng
of his saboth day. This process is written in the book of Neemias in the last
chaptre. Lo how streytly the Jews kepten gods bidding / and god smote them
with bodily pain wha^ they did forgete. But christen men maken their bost how
they be more parfyte in service of their god / then ever were the Jews who
that ever mekely proves his word in deed tha^ may he say boldly that this
time of grace is of more parfeccyon / by virtue of the sacrementes and fredome
of the gospel than was Moses law / and thou a more parfyte man in keeping
this perfeccyon / but and thou be in apostatate in brekyng gods heftes than
is thy pain much the more / as paul said to the Romans To. 11. Forsothe
thou stand in the faith / nyl thou be proud / ne bear the never the hyer /
but abide thou mekely in the holy dread of ye lord. Forsooth sith that the lord
spared not ye kyndely or natural branches / that is to say / the Jews that
he chose to be his kyndely heirs / beware lest be hap he spare not the that
came out of the hethen stock / and art planted in by grace of Christ and of
his gospel. Se now thine apostasy thou unkind wretch and the falsenesse that
thou vsyst against Christ's gospel. Math. 21 Mar. 9. Luce. 19. Io. 2. Jesus
entered in to the tempell of god / and he cast out all sellers and buyers in the
tempell / and ye bordes of money makers / and he turned vpsydowne the chayres
of them that solden doves / and said unto them as it is written. Isaye. 6. Mine
house is cleped an house of prayer. Forsothe ye have made it a den for
thieves. Christ forbedyth the layte the using of their marchandyse either in
town or in church on the holydaye / and he dampneth more streytly among these
vicious prestes byenge of their benefyces / and selling of their sacraments
as ye doctor O do says / upon the same gospel / they ben sellers of doves /
that sellen spu^all things / and though they cry not with there mouths
nevertheless they sayen with Judas. what will ye give / and I will betraye him
to you? Thus cryen our Monks and other bastard religyon that sellen / as they
may take therefore: their habyte / and their suffrages / and other prestes done
also wyckedly that treten deuyne service / and such ben now multiplied in the
church of god / therefore where as thou wenest that the house of prayer is /
there shall thou redely find a den of many thieves. Forsothe all that entren
not by the door / that is Christ / but by money or by seculer favor: they ben
night thieves and day thieves that enter in by a broken wall vnwetynge Jesus
Christ / for he proves not their deeds / and that is unknowing. For that is
the church now all to broken down / when the unable is auaunced to the
church benefyce / either for prayer / either for price / either for vndewe
service / sythen our lord Jesus Christ said to his dyscyples that one of them
was a devil / and mente it by Judas / be not these apostates that done as yuel
as he / worthy to be clepyd deuylles / by the same reason they be great
questyoners and askers of the law / but they would not do so much as put
thereto their finger / and they bepen charge on othere more than they may bear.
They been prayfers of saints / and nothing their folowers / they been herers
of the law / but nothing the doers / they been always lernyng / and never
wylbe parfyte. Thus they bosten in the law with worship and with winning /
but by brekynge of the law they done despise their god. The fourth
commandment of god is this Exodus 20. worship thou thy fader and thy mother
that thou may be long living on the earth the which the lord god shall
give to the / and it sueth of this commandment that they that worshyppen not
there parents shullen have short life here in earth / and after the land of
myschyefe. And therefore Thobye. taught his son a little before his dyenge.
Thobye. 4. Son bery thou my body / and thou shall have worshype to thy mother
all the days of her life. Thou owe for to have in mind what parell and how
many she has suffered in her womb for the. Some counten it no sin to take
from their parents such things as they have because they been their
children. But certes this sin passes theft / and more it greuyth god / as
the wyseman says. Proverb. xxviij. who that withdrawyth any thing from his
fader and mother / and says it is no sin / he is pertener of man slaughter /
for worship of our pare^tes / stands in word and deed / both to teache and
to rule them if they be lewd or poor / and it longs to these pare^tes to
govern well their children: and ordeyne not only for the^ ye goods of this
world but much rather dyspose their life toward the bliss of heaven / as the
wysema^ says / proverb. xxiij. will thou withdraw techynge from the child
for though thou beat him with a yerde / he shall not dye thereon. Thou betyst
them with a belesse / and thou shall deliver his soul from hell / he yt sparyth
the yerde / hatyth his child / forsooth he that loves them woll teache them
besyly / for a wise child gladdeth the fader / and afeltyd child is ye sorrow
of his mother / against this co^maundemet the fend with his members / what
with ypocrytes / that is feigned holiness / what with blind pity / that regnyth
in the seclers he has encombred Christ's church with much worldly mucke / and
ever lad our mother with temporal possessions that she may not rise to heavenly
co^templacyon / therefore their own children waxen wild and wanten / and will
neither take awe ne law / alas this is a great sorrow but our father that is
in heaven to whom nothing is hyd seeing his sons so froward: is steryd all
to wrath though yt he abide long and differ his vengeance / sufferynge from
day to day if that they would amend for he forbade to prestes of the old law
to take such possession among other trybes / but hold them paid of his part
/ for he would be their heritage / for they should prynt this lore / and never
go therfro. Three times it is rehearsed / though ones might have suffysed. First
in the book of Numery.xviij. The second in deuteromij.xviij. The third in
ezechiell.xliiij. And Christ in his gospel twyse forbedyth his prestes to have
this temporal lordeshyp / and reygne even as worldly kings. Ones in his
wyrchynge he forsook it him self. Io. 6. Io. 6.
And also in his techynge that enemies should not say who may live as Christ
did? And nevertheless Gregory says. Gregor
Omeli. vij. Our lord Ihu^ Christ sometime with words sometime with deeds
techyth us. Forsothe his deeds ben commandments for when he does any thing
still in that he makes known to us what we shall do / and notwithstanding
that Christ forbedyth such possessions by word to his prestes. Math. xx. Mar.
x. Luce. xxij. And if enemies will not accept god in his both laws neither obey
to their father / for his word ne for his deed / to whom heaven earth and hell
knelen on their knees / but standen still obstynate as yuel wyly traitors to
cleanse their mother holy church owyth not to take of this foul corrupcyo^.
Then shullen we ley forth holy saints / yt speken of this matter / and say
whether they would accord to words that they have said / and so rise up to
gods word / by these saints. Saint Austen says. The church owyth not to
take tho things that been proffered to her of him that has none heir.
Therefore who that ever will make the church his air / seek he another that may
take it / but on no wise says Austen but by the mercy of god he shall find no
man. And Jerome says. From ye time that the church grew in possessions / she
has lessed or dwyned in virtues / but Bernarde forbedyth these possessions to
be in prestes hands and spekyth unto Eugeny the Pope in these wytty words.
Li. 1. Challenge thou these possessions by a another reason / but thou may not
challenge them by the aposteles right. How might the apostele give that he had
not? that he had he gave / besynes upon churches no whether secler lordshyp?
here what he says / neither lordyng in ye clergy: but made in form to the
profit of the flock / and not only in mekenes trow thou this to be said /
but also in troth of deed. As Christ says in his gospel. Kings of the earth
lorden over them / forsothe ye not so. It is plain to the aposteles that this
lordshype is enterdyted / how darist thou than take this lordshyp upon yt /
either lordynge apostle head / either apostle head to lordshyp? Plainly thou
art forbodden the one for if thou wylt have both / thou shall lose both yt is
to say ye presthode and thy lordshyp / or else thou shall ben except of this
nu^bre / of ye which god pleyneth him. They have reigned / but not by me. They
have been princes / but I have not known the^ / now if avail to raygne
without god / than have thou joy but anemptyst god / and when prestes holden
this enterdityng / hear they then ye lords cry / he yt is more among you be
ye made as ye youngers / and he yt is the forgoare / be he made as the master.
This is ye form of ye aposteles lyuinge. Seculer lordshyp is forboden / but
ministryng and seruyng is boden. well we weten of believe yt god and his law been
even according to gedre / and these with them / than lay besides your poisons /
and your hethen tales: with all other ma^geled laws and confirm you to god to
cleanse ye church and bring it again to ye former estate / and live ye on
christ's part / ye lords might have there lordship again. But yet ye maken
pursuit with money great showers / and sayen that saint Siluester took this
possession / and saint Swithune / and saint william with many other saints. To
this we seyne that Siluester with such other folowers weren saints. To this we
seyne / in this talking of temporal possessions / as was Peter for sakynge
Christ / and Paul pursuyng ye church of god. Peter and Paul did very penance
and suffreden death for Christ's sake / if these men did the same / thus ben
they very saints. The first commandment of god is this. Exo. xx. Thou shall
not kill or slay / neither in malice with pursuynge / neither in word with
backbytynge / neither with deed in unlawful shedyng of blood. Of the first
spekyth. 1. John^. 3. He that hatith his brother / 1. John^. 3.
is a mansleer / some haten sin in man and this is a parfyte hate. Psalmus.
118. Psalm. 118.
I hated them with a parfyte hate. etc. Some haten virtue in man and they be
mansleers / for who that says he loves his god and hatith thus his brother /
he is a liar and there is no truth in him. Of ye second spekith the prophet
and says. Psalm. 13. Psalm. 13.
The mouth of a backbyter is full of cursidnes and bytternes / and his fete ben
swyfte to shed out blood. For saint Bernard says. The backbyter and the wylful
herer either of the^ berith ye devil in there tongue and this backbyter sleeth
three at ones / yt is to say: his own soul / the wylfull herer / and them that
they falsely sclaunderen. Of the third it is written. Gene. 4. How that cursed
Caym slew his innocent brother Abel / and how his blood cries to god from
the earth. For saint John^ says. Apoc. 6. I saw under the altar the souls
of them that weren slain for the word of god / and witness that they hadden
/ and they cried with a great voice saying / holy lord and true / till when
shall thou abide or thou wylt judge and venge our blood on them ye dwellen in
earth and it is said unto them / that they shall be still yet a little while / till
their fellows be common / and their brethren that been to be slain / as they
ben the^ self. Understand thou that god forfendyth all unlawful sleynge. As
Crysostome declares Omeli. To smite is vnyustly to smite forsothe who that
smyteth for the cause of ryghtfulnes / he is not seen to smite / by title of
gods law / forsooth he smyteth not to venge his own wretchefull heart / but
to do the will of god / and to save his neighbors soull / as just wrath is no
wrath / but a fervent diligence / so is rightwyse smiting no smiting / but
against amendynge. For by such a fervent love / Phinyes slwe two lecherous /
and turned the wrath of god from the children of Israel / as it is written.
Numeri. xxv Also god send his hostis. Tytus and Vaspasyan two and forty
winter after that Christ was slain for to venge Christ's death upon ye cursed
Jews / as it is written. Math. xxij. Five things men must avoid when they
shullen go to battle / for they ben against this heste. And thus says saint
Austen. Couetyse of noyenge. Cruelty of auengynge / vnpeaseablenes of mind /
ferue^tnes of fighting / lust of lordshyppynge / and what ben like to these:
for these ben tho things that of right ben blamed in battle against this
commandment the fend in his members settyth watch / and besy spy / where
that he may find any people that woll read preuy or aparte gods law in
english that is our mother tongue: anon he shall be sumnyd to come before his
iuges to answer what is said to them / and bring his book with him / and
either he must forsake his book and redynge of english / and algates he shall
forswere to speak of holy writ. They seyne / live thou as thy father did /
and that is ynowe for the / or else thou shall to preson as if thou were an
heretyke / and suffer pains many and strange and lykely the death / but thou
will revoke thy word and make an open wonderment at thy parysshe church at
home: or in ye commyn place / and with this they prison many an hungry soul.
whereof grows in this realm a grievous gostely morreyne / for who dare now in
these days talk of Christ or of his dome? and certes the body cannot live
without bodily food / no more may the soul without gods word. As saint
Austen says. Austyn.
The soul dies for hunger but if it be fed with heavenly bread and this
bread is gods word. As Christ says in his gospel. Math. 4. Deuteronomy. 4. Mar. 1.
Luc. 4. A man lives not only in bodily bread but he lives a better life
after his soul of each word that passes from the mouth of god. God taught
long before this hungre / for to come that untaught men should ask this bread
/ and no man should give it them / as he says by the mouth of the prophet
Amos. Loo days commen says the lord / and I shall suffer hungre to be sent
into the earth / neither of bread ne of water / but of herynge the word of god
/ than men shullen be moved from the one see to the other / and from the north
/ to the eest / seeking the word of god / and they shall not find it / says
the lord god. For there ben many prechours but their been few true prechours
/ and if any preche the truth / the multitude shall again say him / and thus
me^ abyden still in their gostly hungre for they wete never whom to follow:
their prechynge is so wonderful / ioynynge in their curyous words the troth
to the falshede who that hauntyth to this bread for to sleke his hungre though
he were so holy as ever was saint John^ the baptyst he should not fail to be
sclaundrede for a cursed lollarde / and pursued as an heretyke of these cruel
enmyes. But in this they been much worse than the hethen folks / that trowen
in their mawmettes for wantyng of believe / but these have received the faith /
and falsely gone therfro / and also driven beestly men / to pynde them in their
poundfolde / without gostely meat and drink / till they stern for hungre.
But we reden ye contrary of an hethen king for he dyed much beter to the
children of Israel. 4. Reg. when the children of Israel began to dwell in
samary they dreden not the lord / and the lord sent among them lions that
slew them / and than it was told to the king of Assyre / and said. The
folk that thou haste translated and made them to dwell in the cytees of
samarye / they know not their lawful things of the god of ye earth. Forsothe
the king of Assyrye commanded / saying / ledeth thither one of the prestes
that ye have brought into this thraldom that ye may go and with them dwell /
and teache them the lawful things of the god of the earth. God grant our
christen kings to mark well this story / that they mouen pass this hethen
king in this forsayde matter / than should lions / that been sins / sone be
dystroyed / if all men had the law written in their hertes. As the lord says.
Jeremy.xxxi. Iere. 31.
I shall give my law in the bowelles of them / and I shall wryt my law in the
hertes of them. O ye prestes ye been much to blame that taken from the people
the law that god has written him self in the mids of their hertes. So
through you these foresaid lions now been commen among us / that all to
teren Christ's sheep / and murtheren them to the death Certes ye never learned
this lore in deeds of thaposteles / for this it is written. Act. viij. Lo a
clean chaste man the queen's treasourer of ynde / though he weren and hethen
man and had not taken the faith / yet he rad in Esaye / syttyngr in the chair.
Philip took not away his book / neither he warned him to read therein. But what
than? Philip declared him the prophecye / and taught him for to understand it
/ till he believed on Ihu^ Christ to be gods son of heaven. what betyde than
of Philyp by styryng of the spyryte. when this man believed / confermed in
Christ's name / and gave to him the baptyme. How do ye Prestes parfourme
Christ's hestes and ye aposteles lore that stoppen true christen men from
works of their christendom. The aposteles used not that manner when they went
about to ye temple and to men's houses prechynge and teaching both to Jews
and to the hethen men the laws of Jesus Christ. Act. 5. Forsothe each day in
the temple and about houses / they cessed not prechynge and techynge Jesus
Christ. The syxte commandment of god is this. Exo. xx. Thou shall do no
Lechery / neither with thine eye / in lecherous lokynge / neither with thine
heart: in lusty thinking / neither with thy body in deed doing. And this sin
is forboden. In sengle. In wedded / and in wedowes. Of the first spekyth saint
Austen and says. An unchaste eye is the messanger of an unchaste heart. Of the
second spekyth Christ in his gospll. Math. 5.
Math. 5. who that has seen a woman to do his lust with her / anon he has
done lechery with her in his heart. In this techyth Christ how the rote of
sin spryngeth from the heart. Of the third spekyth Paul. Ephe. 5. Forsooth
know ye this understanding that neither fornycatour neither unclean fylthy /
neither auarous wrethe that is seruage of ydoles / has heritage in the realm
of Christ and god. How ever thou lust to trete the members of thy body again
the reason of thy soul / tha^ thou art a lecherour / and therefore should
both man and woman learn to keep their body in clennes and in virtue to the
worship of their god / and not in foul brennynge desires as folks that known
no reason. And saint Austen says. Austen.
God has given to the power by the holy ghost yt thou hold thy members from
passing of reason / lust rysyth / hold thou thy members nyll thou give thy
members / armor of wyckednes to syn / arm thou not thine adversary against
the to thine own harm hold thy fete that they go not to unlawful things /
lust has risen / witholde thou thy members / hold thine hands from al
felony withold thyn eyes / yt they tend not to yuell witholde thine ears that
they here not the tales of lecherye / witholde all thy body / hold thy sides
hold hye / hold low / what can lust do? Rise it can: over come it can not.
Against this commandment the fend in his members holds a court (as he
says) of holy church law from one weke to a another / for to correct sinners
/ and there they clepen by name the lecherour and his feere / that ledyth their
life in horedome to join the^ to their penance. That is to walk three market
days about the common market / bareheded in their shertes / without hosen and
shoen / and other three sondayes about their paryssh church with a taper in
their hand of a pound of wax and go before the parysshe priest to beten them
with a yerde / also standing on their fete till mass besayde / and than offer
three candeles to the hye altar. The sumner is full busye in all this mean
time / to rowne in their ears and bid them ask grace / for ye shall have
better grace / do by my cou^seyl / pay down money from your purses to my lord
/ and ye shall find him gracious to relese your penance. Than they take their
leave both / wha^ they ben taxed to co^tynue still in their horedome / as they
deden tosore / ye till their death day: so that this rent be paid. Certes this
is a cursed syn that our bysshopes vsen for to maynteyne lecherours in their
own howses: and maken them their ordenaryes that letten syn to great hyre for
their lords alms. Here ye what god says to you. Ezech. xliiij. Suffoce they
to you / house of Israel / all your great felonyes / that ye vsen among you
by cause that ye bring in alyen sons vncircumsysed in heart / and in their
flesh also / that they been in my sentwary / and defoule mine house / and ye
offren my loves / my blood / and my greece / but ye undo my couenaunte in all
your foul felonyes / and ye have not kept in deed the bidding of my
saynctwary / but ye have set the wardeyns of my seyntwarye and obseruauntes
to your own advantages these things says the lord god. This is the^ moral
wit of this forsayde sentence: hye prelates of the church shullen think
thereon / of their own great sins to give a reckoning before god at domesday /
and they would well auyse them though they did not sacre to ye order of
presthode unclean men in body and soul that seek to be prestes neither in
virtue / neither in spirit / but for to live in lusts / these polluten
Christ's church / his flesh / and his blood / and causen why that gods
law is taken for their false court / not christen law but cursed law / is
hold among the people. This was not their covenant at one days time when
they hyghten faith and troth to sue Christ's steps and keep his byddynges in
them self / and also to teache them to othere men / but now they setten
ordynaryes for their wordly profytes that hepen their purse with money of many
foulde sins / but the souls that god chargyth the^ with: to have cure on /
and bring them to the bliss of heaven as sheep unto the fold / they chare not
whether they synke or swymme / so they may reygne as lords. Thus ben all three
estates enfected with Lecherye / from the lewd man unto the clerk and none
amend other / and therefore the lord says. Jeremy. 5. I have fed them and
they have done lechery / they have been horeles / Iere. 5.
in the common bordle house. They ben as fires on women / as horses ben on
mares / and they ben made stalowens that seruen for that office / each man
waxyth wode after his neybours wife upon these things I shall vysyte says
the lord god / and upon these folk I shall venge my will / says the lord
god. The.vij. commandment of god is this. Exo. xx. Thou shall do no theft /
neither Knights by tyranny / neither prestes by ypocresy / neither co^myns by
stelthe or robbery. Of the first it is written. Ysay. 1. Thy princes ben
unfaithful / and fellows of thieves / al they that louen gifts they folowen
rewardynges / they deem not ryghtfull dome to the moderles child / the cause
of the wedowe entryth not to them. Of the second spekyth Christ in his
gospel.x. Io. 10.
He that entryth not by the door into the fold of sheep / but commyth in a
another way / he is a night these / and a day these / this is expounded in the
third commandment. Paul.
Of the third spekyth Paul. Ephe. 4. He that stale / stele he no more / rather
travail each worchynge with his hands that thing yt is good / that we may
have whereof to dele to him that suffryth need. Lord if they should be dampened
as the gospel says. Luc. xvi. that spenden not the true gotten goods after the
form of Christ's techynge where shall they than be punysshrd that wasten their
own / or hyden their own / and falsely stelen other men's. Saint Paul
says. 1. Corynt. ^. Thieves shall not possess the realm of heaven / and in
this be contained ye threfolde stelynges / but sythen that god has ordained al
thing in number weight / and mesure / as the wyseman says. who that falsyth
any of these three / or falsely uses them he is a thief and worthy pain as the
wyseman says. Proverb.xi. A treacherous or a false balance is abhomynacyon
enemptyst god / an even weight is the lords will as it is said. Leuitic. xix.
will thou do any thing vneuinly in any of these four / In dome / In rule / In
weight / In mesure. Look thy balance be just / and thy weyghte even. Look thy
busshell be just / and thy measur even / I am your lord god. Against this
commandment the fend with his cautyles has whyled into the church many
strange thieves that done stele both night and day and yet they ben not hanged
/ but god has ordained for them galowes in hell / and they yt ben ons hanged
theer / shall never be delivered / but they that hangen on man's galowes by
judgment of this world / oftyn by this shameful death and by very repentance
ben saved from endeles pain and so was the thief that hanged on Christ's right
side in time of his passion / but they that fallen bacwardes and mowen not se
their fall / they hangen on Christ's left side in peril of their soull / from
whom Christ tourneth / his gracious face. As the prophet says / speaking by
the mouth of Christ to these foresaid thieves. Isay.lix. Your wyckednes has made
a deuorce betwyxt the lord and you / and your sins have hyd away from you
his gracious face / that he should not here you when ye cryen upon him.
Forsothe your hands ben full of blood / and your fyngers been full of syn. Your
lyppes have spoken lesynges and your tongue spekyth wyckednes / the face of god
is take here for his grace in man's mind in another place it is taken for
Christ's incarnacyon / and in another place it is taken for the glory of god in
his everlasting majesty / and these three ben turned away from these forsayde
spoylours / and the cause why / the prophet says. Been these two things
their hands: and their fyngers ben full of blood and wyckednes upon this says
parisiens. who that has either by theft or robberye / either by streynght or
tyranny / either by fraud or gyle as ypocresye tho things of which the poor
owed to be nourysshed he has his hands polluted in poor men's blood. And
who that clokyth him with such gods or fedyth him with such gods / or
reryth up buyldyng with such gods than is he clad in poor men's blood /
than is he fed with poor men's blood / than groundeth he his building on
poor men's blood. Some men sayen it is no sin to take what men will give
them. Some sayen they woll spend their goods there they have most devotion.
Some mortesyn / house land / water and wode into ded hands. To you we ask
this questyon. what profyteth ye hand without the fyngers / or the fyngers
without ye hand? If we may say that either of them may wyrche his work
without other to man's profit / than may ye say ye devotion may profyt
without discretion and else not / for thus it is written. Cant. 5. Mine hands
have dropped myrre / and my fyngers most proved myrre / these ben ye words of
a true soul. Upon this says saint Bernarde. Deuocyo^ without discrecion lies
void and does no good: descrecyo^ without devotion throwyth down hedelyng he is
blessed yt wa^tith neither of these: look what it profytith to have Christ in
manhood without his godhede / or to have a body without a soul: or to have faith
in word without any deed / or to have letter without any understanding: or to
have a lamp without oil / so profits devotion with out discrecion. Some men
yet besy the^ to mainteyne this theft and sayen / these me^ that ye marken ben
devout prayers / and good prechours / and algates among them god is fair
served. As to their prechynge Christ answeryth and says. Math. 7. Luc. 12.
Many shall come to Christ / and say to him in the day of dome. Lord / Lord /
have we not preched in thy name. Saint Austen says. The lord shall not deny
this. For who so ever ye precher be / a devout herer may wyn him mede. But
Christ shall knowledge to them and say / for I know you never / that is to say.
I approved never your works / go ye from me: all ye that wroken wyckednes /
and as to their prayers saint Austen says in a book yt he made of monks life.
It profitith not to pray / and let ye land lyg lay and as to their fair
service / as it is said before: god is now here fair seruid / but there as his
law is fair kept: but in these.iii. they disceyuen ye people of there believe /
and robben the^ of there virtue / and also spoylen the^ of their goods as it is
written. Miche. 4. These things says the lord god upon prechours that
disceyuen my people as with their prechynge that byten with their tethe / as
for their prayenge / and prechen peace / as for their fair serving / and who
that wol not give somewhat to the mouth of the^ they halowen battle upon him /
therefore the lord says. Night shall be to you for your vysyon / and derkenesse
for your dyuynacyon. These woll be meke without dyspyte / poor without defaute
/ well clade without besynes / delycately fed without travail / whyly
flatterers to the^ that they begylen: yuyl whyly traitors to them that they
haten / hastye pursuers of them that they sclaunderen sore byters as dogs /
dysceytefull as foxes / proud as lions / enuyous as adders / without forth as
sheep / within as rauysshynge wolves / they woll be iuges without authoryty /
and at the last false accusers / and wasting all virtue / and therefore the
wyseman says. Proverb. 6. That ye lord both hatith and loves them that
sows dyscorde among neybours. These ypocrytes will not fuffre any darte of
coreccyon to thrylle them / but in each syn that they done / they leyen forth
the bokeler of proud defense / and when any of them is blamed of his wyckednes
/ he will not think anon how / he may amend it: but he spekyth besyly help
how he may defend it. The viij. commandment of god is this. Exo. xx. Thou
shall not speak false witness against thy neybour / neither for geftes taking
/ ne for man's steryng / neither thy self in sin exclusynge. Of the first
it is written. Isaye. 5. woe to you that iustyfyen ye wicked man / for geftes /
and take away the ryghtwysnes of a just man for he may not pay. Of the second
spekyth a wise man. Proverb. xix. A false wytnes berer shall not be vnponysshed
/ and he that spekyth lies shall perysshe as the prophet says. Psalm. ^. Psalm.
5.
Lord thou shall lose all tho that spekyn lesyng. For the wyseman says. Sap.
^. The mouth that lies sleeth the soul. And therefore Christ says. Io.
viii. Io. 8.
Ye liars been the sons of your father the devil and ye will do the desires
of your father. He was a manslear fro the beginning / for he stood not in
truth / for troth is not in him / when he spekyth lesynge / he spekyth of
his own authorytye / for he is a liar and father of lyenge. Of the third
spekyth the prophet. Psalmus. 14. Psalm. 14.
Lord put thy ward to my mouth / and odor of circumstaunce to my lyppes /
bow thou not my heart into the words of malice / to excusacions to be excusyd
in syn. For the wyseman says. Proverb. 2. They that maken merry when they have
done yuell and ioyen in worst things be they punysshed with endeles pains.
Again this commandment the fend with his cautylles has give leave to. xij.
men for.xij. grotes to pass forth on a quest again ryghtwyse blood / and say
a false witness / that the man is gyltye and anon he shall be ded though it
were Christ him self. In this the fendes members grounden them on Iezebel. iij.
Reg. xxi. For she sent letters in the name of Achab sealed with his signate to
Inreours of the country and charged them that they should cesse two men sons
/ that might say false witness against the knight Nabothe that he had both
waryed god and the king / and by this false witness they slowen this gyltles
knight. Certes so in our days who that medyth this Jurors that been the sons
of belyall and quest mongers / he may slay / and he may save. Thus false were
never the Jews / for when the two old prestes that brent in lechery of the
woman Susan. As the story tellyth. Danyel.xiii. And she would not consent to
do their foul lust / than they gave a sentence of her false witness / whereby
she was iuged worthy to be deed / and as she was lad to the fire / she made her
devout prayer / and than god reryd up / the heart of a young man that was
clepyd Danyell / and he revoked her dome / and repreued these old prestes of
their false wytnes / so that gods angel with a sherp sword slew them for
their false dome in sight of all ye people / and they praised god almighty of
this fair delyuerau^ce. How should ye Iurryours escape the fire of hell / that
(for a little money) wol dampne ye reckneuer whom / and dysheryte trwe heirs of
their just heritage / for tho / that woollen not say the truth / but if they
taken mede / sellen Christ / that is truth / and been worse then the Jews /
for they slowen him when he came to dye / but now he reygneth vndedly / where
shall tha^ your pain be? that woll say false wytnes for to catch advantage of
worldly wynnyge? ye sell your self your body and your soul into ye fe^des
service / yet may we se more encu^brau^ce of ye fe^des wirchyng for there is
none offycer temporal nor spu^all but that he is ready when he may to take
gifts of ye poor co^myns / and pyll them ever among and else they shall no
peace have / from greuousser oppressynge / as is taken of their beasts with
corn and other vitayles and other payment get they none / but a white stycke /
till they have lost half on half with much more travail. Lord if ye marked
well that Ietro said to Moses. Exo. xviij. Son ye should amend this / or
else ye ben incurable. Ietro counceled Moses that he should wisely ordeyne
mighty men that dreden god in whom was very troth and that hated auaryce with all his cursed branches and they should have office in rulyng under Moses /
Moses consented and wrought after his counseyl. Therefore / peace / welthe /
and grace reigned in his days. Rere up your wits ye Princes and lords of
this world / and se how King Iosephath charged to his officers. Paral. xix.
Iosephath ordained iuges in all the cytees of Iurye / and gave them the byddyng
/ beware what ye do / forsothe he says this dome that ye haunten is not the
dome of man / but ye dome of god / and what that ye demen shall turn upon your
selfs look the dread of god be among you and does all things with dylygence
/ forsothe anemptyste god is no wickedness / neither accepting of parsons /
neither couetyse of geftes and he chargyth prestes and decans that they should
make known all the doubts of ye law / left that ye people sinned. If this
lore were well learned of our christen princes and lords ye hard hands of
Antechrist should be al to broken: christian people should have leave to do their
office truly: and each man his fredome to serve god in virtue then were this
good governance and saving to the realm in peace / in wealth and in every
estate / as Prestes Knights and commyns. For thus says Crysostom. Omeli. 1.
It is to note that who that of kings has pleased god they have reigned the
longer and they have been welthy / and god has lowed their enemies under the^.
For soth as many as have done wyckedly they have been cut up hastily both from
their reign and from their life with a better death / and god has lowed the^
under their enemies thraldom. The.ix. commandment of god is this. Exodus xx.
Deuteronomy. 5. Thou shall not couyte the house of thy neybour In the.vij.
commandment / god forbedeth the unlawful taking of other men's goods and
so in that he refrayneth desyer of men's deed / but in this commandment god
forbedyth the couetyse of unlawful taking / and in that he refrayneth the
vnordynate appetite of man's desire namely in all tho things that been
immovable / that is to say that mowen not move them self by their own might
from one place to another / as been house / land / gold / and such other
like to these and this vicious couetyse if it be conceived grows to death of
the soul / from the rote of man's heart / for when the will has consented
to do that thing that god forbedyth though the deed follow not after in
outward syghte of man's dome / and nothing lettyth to do the deed / save
will may not as it would / than the soul is deed gostely within the house of
the body / and this death is signyfyed by a parsons daughter that was deed
within her fathers house / and Christ by miracle gave her life. Math. 9. Mar.
5. Luc. 8. Some norysshen their couetyse till it spring into a deed / as a
carreyne opynly deed / that lies by ye way effectyng the people / and this is
taught in the wedowes son that was borne deed on a bear without the gates of
ye cite for to put him in his grave. Luke. 7. Luke. 7.
Christ ^ered him by his miracle / and gave him again to his mother. Some
feden their foul couetyse with lust and delectacion / in thought / in word /
and in work / and this most abhomynable / for it waa showed in Lazarus. Io.
xi. yt lay.iiii. days in his grave. And Christ by miracle / Io. 11.
to turn the Jews rered up his body and gave him the spirit. All these three
ben against this commandment of god / and ben worthy endeles pain / but if
god thorough his gracious mercy move them to virtue and to very penance / that been deed in these foresaid foul couetyses / that is to say / in couetyse of
heart / of deed / and of custom. And therefore the wyseman says. Eccli. xviij.
Go not away from thy god after thine own couetyses. Lord how should he keep
him from a vycyous deed that does not out of his heart the couetyse thereof?
Certes it is as impossyble as to save the house from brennyng that thou settyst
afyre with thine own hands. A wede may not be distroied but if it be drawn
up by the rotes. No more may sin be left / but if the delectable couetyse of
sin be pulled out of the heart. For if their abide any part of this foul
couetyse vndrawen up in heart / anon their spryngeth up thereof / theft /
false purchase / and such other. And therefore said Moses unto the children
of Israel. Deuteronomy. xix. Thou shall not take / ne thou shall not pass the terms
or the bonds of thy neybour the which thine elders have set in thy possessyon
that thy lord god shall give to the / for who that takythe away his neybours
ground / that is to say / land or place / wode or water / corn or grass /
in fylde or in town: thorough any of these foresaid couetises he stands in
that a cursed of god and his law / for thus it is written. Deuteronomy. xxvii. Cursed
be that man or woman that passyth the bands of lawful measure between their
neyboures and them. Again this commandment the fend with his cautyles has
larged this couetyse to all ye estates that uneath any man takyth head how
that he come by good that he were rich. Commyns have purchased at Antechristes
proctour to be fermours of the church and all for couetyse of wynnyng / and by
this parysshons ben brought in many customs / yt dystroyen peace / and
norysshen debate / and quenchen gods law / but who so ever says or byddeth
besides gods will / yt is not proved in holy wryt / and openly declared / he
is a false wytnesser / and does cursed sacrilege / and so says saint Austen.
when the lord god has said in his gospel. I am truth / he said not I am
custom. Than when the troth is showed custom must needs give steed to
troth. Peter that circumcysed consented to Paul prechynge the troth.
Therefore sithen Christ is troth we owen much more to sewe troth than custom
/ for evermore reason and troth shullen exclude custom when reason and troth
excluden these fermoures and all their false customs he is a very membre of
the devil that maynteneth the contrary / and makyth the house of Jesus Christ
the common shop of marchandyse. But lords here ben more to blame that should
chastyce this sin / for some been fermoures them self / and fauoren for
their couetyse that the person shall have leave in grutty places as an hog in
the mire / and leave his cure vnkepte. The lords in these days been so smytten
with couetyse that they holden false gotten goods against their own conscyens
/ and feel sythys reren strong hand armyd in strong wodenesse to call men
both slepynge and waking to increase their lordshypes. King Acab for
couetyse of Nabothys vineaerde that he desired to have had again this knights
will / laid him self gronyng on his bed and would not taste any mete / for
Nabothe said he would not change ne sell his kind heritage. But zezebell the
wicked queen gave the king such counsel that they casten this knight death
by a false sclaundre / and thus brought them to an end and reioysed his
vyneaerde. God sent word to Achab and Iezebell by the prophet Hely / that
for they had thus couetously against his commandment there blood should
beshede on the earth / and hands should like it. And more god took vengeance
for grievous sin upon the sede that came of them into the third and fourth
generation / and if that we took head how lords have slain each other / in
shedynge of their blood in the fylde for couetyse of lordynge / we should not
wonder though gods hand be stretched over his people to smite with vengeance
as he does / and no man may avoid it. Couetyse of lordynge has / is / and
shall be cause of much blood shedynge.
And if thou will wete what is this vengeance. God says by the prophet
Osee. iiii. That his vengeance is when he withdrawith his chatysynge and the
yerde of amendyng and suffrith his enemies to reign in their sin till their
death day / and after to dampne them body and soul ever without end. And to
this accordyth saint Gregory in his moralles upon. Job. God sparyth to some in
this life that he may smite them withouten end. And Job says.xxi. why lyuen
wicked men auaunced and comforted in richesse? The sede of them dwellyth before
them / and the company of nigh friends and cosens in their sight: their houses
been sekyr / and the yerde of god that is cleped his chastysynge / is not upon
them their eekfare conceived / and cast not her fruit or time / their ko^e bare
her fruit / and was not berafte the profit of her womb. There strepelynges
gone before them as flocks of beasts / and their youngelynges ioyen in pleys
and in ga^mes: they holden the tymbre and the harp / and they ioyen at the
sound of the Organne. They leden their days in goods / that is to say / in
health and in welthe / and in worldly worship / and suddenly in a point they
dyscenden or gone down to helles / but agaynwarde. Solomon in his
proverbs.iii. And saint Paul to the Hebrews.xii. Sayen that god reproves and
chastyseth all them that he loves / and receives to bliss. And therefore
says Johan. 2. Math. 6. It is a token of great goodness not to suffer long time
sinners of their wicked purpose to sue their own folly / but sone put to them
merciful chastysement / forsothe the lord does not so with his chosen as he
does with an alyen nacyon / that is tho that he forsakyth thorough their
deseruynge / and castyth them out of his sight / whom he abides patiently to
punysshe them at the full in domesday / forsooth he has not ordained so to
ponyshe them whom he louyth / but he chastyseth them pacyently and after
receives them to his gracious favor and mercy. But prestes in this couetyse
most greuen their god / for they been authors of this sinners that we have
said aforne. They seyen yt they have a law that they clepen them self /
fredome of holy church / thosse it be boundage of the devil / and by this
they may purchase out of the secler hand / ye all their lyfelode if they might
win it by one mean or by another / and what they win into their power
their may no man win it or redeem it again into the hands of ye seclers /
fro holy fredome / and who so does shall be suspended from holy church right /
and a cursed by their law / till he restore it again / thus they undo secler
party with their feigned holiness / in clepyng there sorry church / holy church /
and their thraldom / fredome / and magnyfyen their sermons above the law of
god / so that lay men ben oppressed under these prestes / as far as the Jews
weren with Scrybes and Pharysees. The deuell when he tempted Eve made a fair
semblante for to stir her to couetyse to break gods byddyng in etynge of
the appell whereby death should enter. This woman saw the appell that it was
good in beholding / and fair in sight / and also lykerous in smellyng / she
ete thereof and gave to her husband / he bote thereof / than both were dedly
and loften the joy of paradyse. The master of ye sentence says yt this apple
is syn that god forbedyth / than after the wit of allegory / yt is thus to
mean / when that secler men formen spu^al office / and when ye prestes bowen
down to take temporal lordshyp by temptyng of ye devil in their foul couetyse
/ than these two parties as Adam and Eve / and they yt ben co^sentours ben
driven out of the bliss of heaven with the sharp of gods word. Balaam was
caught in this couetyse / and his own best repreued him and hurt his foot
again a wall for his journey plesed not god but this man would not beware / and
therefore he was slain among the hethen people. Numeri. xxii. This couetyse
styred Giezi to take mede of Naaman for a spu^al benefyce ye god him self
has wrought by his servant Helysy in clensynge of his mesebry / and therefore
Giezi with his generacyon were smyten for ever with ye leper of Naaman.iiij.
Reg. 5. Anany and Saphir his wife ouercommen with this couetyse laid in their
conscience before saint Peter's presence / and therefore they dyed both in the syn
of wanhope. Act. 5. who that redyth this blyssed lore that is our faith and
gods law / but he leave this couetyse / he standyth in peril of his scule /
as god says by the prophet Esaye. 5. woe to you that ioynden house to house /
and couplen fylde to fylde unto ye term of a place / whether no should ye dwell
alone in mids of the earth / says the lord god. In this god forbedith the
unlawful couetyse that we have said aforne. For if this couetyse catch not
root in the heart / it shall never grow to the deed / as it is said before.
And therefore says Paul. 1. Corinthians. x. Be we not coveting of ill / as some of
your elders have coueted / and we prayen for charytee look in these places /
and se what has fallen for this sin of couetyse. Genesi. iii. Numeri. xiij.
xvi. and.xxij. iiij. Reg. 5. Act. 5. This.x. commandment of god is this.
Exo. xx. Thou shall not desire thy neyhbours wife / ne his servant / ne his
handemayde / ne his ox / ne his ass / ne thing that is his otherwise than
thou wylt he shall desire thine / after reason and the law of Christ's gospel.
In the.vi. commandment god forbyddyth the outward deed of lechery / and in
that he refrayneth the unlawful treating of thy body / but in this forbyddeth
the inward consent of the heart and in that he refrayneth all unlawful desire
or will namely in tho things that been immovable / that is to say that have
no might in them self to remove from one place to another for the desire and
will that restyth in the inward man / makyth merit or sin more or less in
the presens of god / for charitable works that been in their own kind mighty
and great ben done sometime with a froward will / and than they wanten mede / as
Christ says in his gospel. Math. 7.
Math. 7. Not each man that says to me lord lord / shall enter into the
realm of heuennes. A man shall not be only saved for his good works ne his
good deeds / wherefore than? But he that does the will of my fader that is in
heuennes / that is to say / after the desire that a man has in word and deed
to do the plesynge will of god / he shall be after that rewarded in bliss and by
this greatness of man's good will though it work / but little in kind / is
askyth great reward in bliss. And therefore the aungelles songen in Christ's
birth Luc. 2. Peace be in earth to men of good will / for such a good will
traueylethe to please god in word and in deed / and when it may no ferther
streche / this will is counted for a deed / as the master of sentence
reherseth. Saint Austen says that this mother ignorance / that we clepen
vncunnyngnes / has three daughters. The first ben all tho that might learn and
will not: The second been all tho that would learn and may not. The third /
been all tho that taken none head. The first shall algates be dampened. The
second shullen algates be saved / because that their will answeryth for the
deed. The third accordyth with the first / but if it so be that they should
have less pain in hell / and therefore yuell will that a man has to win him
gostely strenght / or to have knowing of very believe / to do the plesynge will
of god / is the werst yuell that comes to man / and straung lyth him with
despeyre in the hour of his death. But yet we should understand that the will
of the godhede standyth in three things according to the trynyte / and we must
do our vtermost to confyrme our will to his. The father of his royal will
commaundyth that ryghtwysnesse were done. The son of his wit will / suffers
the less yuyll / the more to be fled and abides sinners long by virtue of his
incarnacyon. The holy ghost af his charitable will forbedith al uncleanness / than
we be confourmed to do ye fathers will and byddyng / and when the wisdom of
our will is turned to virtuous mercy both to our self and to other / than
sue we Christ's steps / but when the love of our will spedythe in due order
both in heaven and in earth / as we have said before / than dwellyth the holy
ghost in our inward man / if this knot be truly knyt: in will of our soul /
there is no enter for the devil to trouble us from unity. As saint Ierom
says. The devil fyghteth not again us with open face / but with gyle: for he
uses again us our own will / he takyth him strenghte of our own consent /
and weryeth us with our own sword / he may never overcome us / but thorough
our own will / therefore for the desperacyon / remedy again this devil is study
in holy wryt. And to this intent spekyth the wyseman Proverb.vi.
Commandments ben a lantern / and the law is light / and the way of life /
and a monycyon of lernyng / that it may keep the from an yuell woman / and from
the smothe tongue of a stranger. Look thine heart conyte not the fayrenesse of
her. Is it possible for a man to hyde fire in his shert and not brenne his
clothes? or else walk in the brennynge cooles / and not brenne the sooles of
his feet? So he that has entered in to his neighbors wife / shall not be
clean when he has lecherously touched her. For he yt is an aduoulterer by the
foul gredye desire of his heart / shall lose his soul / for he gatheryth to
him uncleanness and shame / and his sclaunder shall not be done away / for the
zele and wodenesse of the man shall not spare in the day of vengeance nor he
shall not spare for prayours of any man / nor he shall take no gifts for his
redempcyon. For sayncte Jerome says. A gloton has his heart on his womb /
A wanton man on his lechery / A covetous man on his winning / Any guard on his
holding. And therefore says Solomon. Proverb.iiij. with all dylygence keep
thine heart / for life passyth from it. And saint show says. In all creatures
that been occupied under heaven in man's vanytees / there is nothing hyer than
man's heart / there is nothing found lyker to god / wherefore god sekyth
nothing of the but thine heart. Against this commandment the fend with his
cautylles moves dyscorde in ye hertes of them that been wedded / till the
desire have departed the one from the other. Than the man fayneth a cause to go
from the woman / and in this they ben accursed / as the wyseman says
Proverb.xviij. he sekyth occasyons that wol go away from his friends / at all
times he shall be acursed and worthy rebuke. Nevertheless a fool will not receive
the words of techynge / but if thou say to him such things as his heart
desires / and therefore he rennythe forth in wodnes of his heart for to
procure a divorce between him and his wife / he comyth anon to the church
that is cleped lawles / not for the church but for the officers / for they ben
lawles. Anon he chusythe him a notarye / and pays him his wages to make him
an instrumente of his forged lesynges / than goyth he to the masters that
sytten on their seats with furred hoodes / and fond heddes / and gyuethe them
money great plentye / and prays them to be his advocates that this dyuorce
were made / for he wylbe ready at the lawles day to bring forth his twelve
hands before the judge / sir Symont and make good with all the court that he
has no right to the woman that he wedded for deeds done before / than sir
Simont gives dome / to dyssolue true wedlock / and authoryseth lechery to
these both parties for to live in horedome from that day forthwarde and
sendythe them forth at the doors departed each fro other. But lo what Christ
says. Mat xix. Marc. x. Luc. xvi. For matrymony a man shall leave father and
mother / and he shall hold him to his wife / and they shall be twain in one
flesh that is for their dwelling shall be to geder. Also they been not than
twain / but one flesh that is by virtue of the sacrament / wherefore that
thing that god has joined / man may not depart. I say forsothe to you that
who so ever has left his wife except for the cause of fornycacyon / and if
he wedde another he is a lecherour / and who that weddyth this woman that this
man has left / he ledyth his life in lechery / as long time as he holds
her / sythen that god joins never but in lawefull manner how dare ye pursue
this dyuorce in a lawles church? Saint Paul says to the Romans in ye second
chapter. whosoever synneth without law shall perisshe without the law. For
and they weren blind and knew not the law / they might happily the easelyer
be excusyd: but now they sayen they know the law / and done full hardely
against the law / they have not excusacyon. And therefore the wiseman says. An
wholesome remedy against this sin of the heart. Eccli. xviii. Be thou turned
from thine own will and obey thou to gods will / and than (says Bernarde)
thou shall never come in hell / and therefore while thou art hole and sounde^
waver not about in thoughts of diverse errors / from god and from virtue.
Bryse down not only such unlawful couetyse / but also al super flue and
unstable thoughts / and suffer them not on any wise to grow to deed ne to
custom. And this seems to be the sentence of the prophet where he says.
Psalm. 136. Blyssed is that man that shall hold / and hyrt his youngelynges at
the stone / as the works of man been his yongelynges / or sons or daughters
/ after the gostly sense / so tho thoughts of the inward man been his
yongelynges. Than he hyrtyth his yongelynges at the stone of ryghtwysnes / wha^
he dystroyeth their soden crepynges / in thinking of the life of our lord
Jesus Christ. For soth this is a specyal remedy to with hold wicked thoughts
/ desires / and wylles that they flow not to depely withinforth / neither that
they flee to fer without forth / and such traueyles thryuen tho yt god has
chosen: for they will not in any disease be overcome neither co^sente to these
cautyles of ye devil / by which he enprysoneth gods servants for they kepen
these.x. foresaid commandments / but saint Hyllary says. This propartye
has Christ's church / when that it is pursued / it floryssheth / when it is
brysed down / it growyth: when it is despised it profyteth / when it is hurt
/ it ouercommyth / when it is blamed / it shyneth / and then it stands most
strongly when it semyth in man's eye to be ouercommen. This church is a true
soul / as we have said before / some that been tender and feeble for to suffer
cryen with abachuc / and sayen to god. Lord how long shall I cry / and thou
shall not here me? Lord till when shall I call upon the thus suffrynge strong
trybulacyon / and thou shall not make me saufe? why haste thou showed me
wyckednes and traueyle / and suffrest theft against me and vnryghtwysnesse?
why beholdeste thou these dyspysers / and art still? the wicked man defoulynge
him yt iuster than he? Saint Jerome says in his prologe / that these been
the words of man's impacyence / and settyth an ensample of a sick man
swellynge in the fevers and asking cold water saying to his leche / I suffer
woe / I am all to tourmentyd / I am full nigh deed / how long shall I cry
(leche) and thou shall not here me? The wytty and the most merciful leche
answeryth to him / I wot in what time it behouith me to give to the that thou
askyst / I have no ruthe on the now / for this mercy were cruelty and thine
own will makyth against the. Also our lord god knowing the weight and the
measure of his mercy / sometime he heryth not the crier anon / that he may
prove and more stere him to pray / and as examyned by the fire / that he may
make his servant both iuster / and purer / to receive grace / and mede.::

What is the fendes church with her propertyes. The.xiii. chapter.
TO speak of the third churhe enpropryed to the devil the which is the
nombre of them that been encombryd to serve him after his tysynge against
gods hestes. First we shall take our ground of ye prophet Psalmo. 28. I
have hated ye church of malygners. These been they that strayen away after
their own desyers / walking in the way that ledyth them to hell / neither
they wylbe governed by law ne by grace / neither they will for dread ne love
cesse and go from sin / because this world is full of lusts and proferryth
his lovers a joy sone passing / but they that traueylen after bliss here
they suffren pain / therefore fools withouten nombre ioyen with this world /
as Christ says in his gospel. Mathewe. 7. Enter ye by the strayte gate /
for large is the gate and broad is the way that ledythe to dampnacyon / and
many entren therein. But O lord how paynfull is the gate / and streyt is the
way / that ledyth to life / and few their been that fynden it: For saint Johan
says. All the world / that is / all tho me^ and women that been overcome with
this world / ben set in malice / that is brennyng in the fire of foul
couetyse / for all thing that is in this world / either it is ye couetyse of
eyes / other else it is the couetyse of the flesh / or else it is the pride
of this life / and therefore this church is grounded upon the devil in the
grauel of false couetyse. As Paul says. The root of all euylles is couetyse
/ the which some desiring have erryd from true believe / and have joined them
self to many sorrows / the rerynge up of this church is in glotony / and
lechery as the wyseman says rehersyng the words of them that shall be dampened.
Go we (say the fendes lymmes) fill us with precious wine and oyntementes / and
suffer we not the flower of our fair bewty to pass away from us / crown we
us: with rosys of iolyte or that they walken away / there may be no medowe but
if our lechery pass thereby / none of us may be lotles / of our lechery / every
where leave we tokyns of our gladness. The helynge of this church / is pride
and hyenes of life / as the prophet says. Psalm. 36. I have seen the vnpetyous
/ and the wicked man enhaunsed and up lyfted as the cedres trees of Lyban / and
they been the highest trees of the world / but as smoke ryseth sodynly / and
sone vanyssheth to naught so they proud ben praised for a time / and than they
fallen away / and we weten not where they become / of the busynes and occupacion
that dwellers of this church vsen / spekyth the prophet. Night and day
wickedness shall compass about this church upon their walls / and travail
in mids of it / and vnryghtwysnes and Okyr. Iuglynge / and Treachery / has
not stynted in the ways of her. Of this church with his manner of buyldyng
spekyth Christ in his gospel. Math. 7. Luc. 6. who that heryth my words and
does them not / is like a folysh man that has build his house upon the
gravel of couetyse and mysbeleue / and rain of glotony and lechery came down
on this church / and ferly this foresaid sins fallen in to this church and
driven it down / and the fall of her was great: for she fell from grace and
glory to pain and mischefe without end / as saint Austen says. For soth that
is not the body of the lord / that shall not be with him withouten end / for
ypocrytes ben not said to be with him though they been seen to be in his
church. Certes the devil is head of all wicked / which ben on some manner / his
body / to go with them in to ye tourment of everlasting fire / for when they
token baptysme they hyghten faith and troth to keep gods commandments /
as the prophet says speaking in the parson of the general church Psalm.
118. Lord I have sworn and ordained to keep thy commandments / and upon
this covenant Christ took him to his marriage / with the ryng of steadfast
faith he sacred the holy spousayle / but now they leave this chaste love our
lord Ih^ Christ / in brekynge of this covenant / and have chosen an hoar
master the fend that is a spouse breker and lyggeth in auoutre with her like
spoils. For saint John^ Chrysostom says. Forsothe every soul it is Christ's
spouse / or else it is an aduoulteresse of ye devil for Christ and the devil
may in nowise rest to geder in the bed of man's soul / for they ben so
contrary that what so ever the one byddyth / that the other forbyddeth. Christ
sekyth salvation / the fend dampnacyon / Christ loves virtue / the fend
loves sin / Christ gatheryth to geder / and the fend scateryth abroad. And
Paul says ii. Corinth. what pertycypacion is there of right wysnes with
wyckednes? what fellowship is there of light with darkness? what co^munyon is
there of Christ with belly al? or what part is there of a faithful man: with an
unfaithful man? or what consent of ye temple of idols with ye church of god?
Certes none / for each of these again sayen other after there own wyrchyng.
Now shall we tell what they ben that dwellen with the fend for to serve him
in his church that is the temple of idols. waryours / cursers / chyders /
sclaunders / and blasphemers / there been vylayne spekers / liars / glosers /
backbyters / mottrars / swerars / and forswerars / there ben also mychers /
robbers / extorcyoners / tyrants / and oppressers / there ben vntrwe tyllers /
unfaithful servants / rechelesse hired men / rebel dyscyples / and
unprofitable labourer^ / there been lecherours / fornycatours / aduoulterers /
incestours / that is / defoulers of their own kynne / and unclean men and
women that been within the order of perfeccion there ben ypocrites / sodomytes /
sacrylegers / and sellers of the holy sacraments / there ben al ye prayen
seruen or given gifts for church or spu^all office / or benyfyce / all false
possessyoners / all mighty wylful mendynners and al stourdy maynteners. There
ben all tho men that bosen there breasts / pynchen their belyes partyn there
hosys: crakowyn there shoys: and al disguysers of their garnamentes. There ben
tho that sterchen or poppen their faces / that brydelen there hedes with gyg
halters yt setten above honykombes with much other atyrynge / to make them
self sale kene to sin / and setten abroad there pappes to catch men with
their lymes yardes. There ben false law makers / gods law haters /
offynders of customs / distroyers of virtue / and auctours of syn / in this
church also been mawmotres / heretykes / idolatrers / sortylegers enchau^tours
arriolers / charmours and rerers of the devil / and al tho yt trowen yt help
may come of using gods word / that we clepyn writtes only hangyd or borne on
man: or yt they ben medycynable to body or soul so honged or so borne / there
ben marchau^des / chapmen / vytellers: vynteners tauerners: chau^gers / buyers:
sellers / yt vsen dysceyte: in weight / nombre / or measure / there been in
this church usurers / okerers: iuryours / quest mongers / and all false wytnes
berers there ben pleters / lawyers / sequesters / commyssaryes / offycyalles /
dens / sumners / and all that sellen troth or sin to make money / their ben
also audytours / receyuours / treasurers and proctours / judges / and all that
excepten parson for a cause impartynent. This church when it is beten / it
waxes harder / when it is blamyd / it waxes the duller / when it is taught /
it is ye lewder / when it is done well to / it is the shrewder / and than it
fallyth down / and comes to naught / when it seems in man's eye most
strong to stand saint Austen says. Christ's church pursues yuell lyuers in
charity by way of amendment. But the fendes church pursues the church of
Christ in malice / by way of sclaunder and sleynge / and this cayme that false
enuyous man slew his brother Abell that blyssed and simple innocent man as the
fyfty expositours sayen in a prologe on this Psalm. Quid gloriaris in malicia.
That Cayme was the beginning of Babylon and Antechryste shall be the end / and
Abell was the beginning of Jerusalem / and Christ shall be the ender. Forsooth
Ismael pursued Isaac but not so Isaac Ismaell / Esau pursued Jacob / but not so
blyssed Jacob cursed Esau / for by counsel of his mother he fled in to Mesopony
from the wrath of his brother / till that it was swaged. Thus our mother holy
church counseyleth her children to fle from the malice of the fendes church
till that it be slaked. Math. 10. Forsooth if the fendes church shall pursue
you in this cytee / flee ye till another / but this must be done by dyscrecyon
for hurtynge of our brothers conscyens. Christ pursued not the Jews but the
Jews Jesus Christ / hethen men slew the apostelles but not the apostelles
hethen men / se now frowardnes of this world that has been from the
beginning. when Isaye the holy prophet prophesied and preched unto the people
/ they would not here is words ne suffren him on live / but the people that
risen after his death radde his books and sayden / if we hadden lived in his
days / he should not have been deed / and yet they slewen Ieremye that with
the spyryte of god told things to come / and taught them very troth / his
successors token his books and radde them in there temples / and ^eyled him
for an holy man / but they slewen Ezechyel and other mo / than the Jews maden
fair the tombs of these prophets / as were scrybes and pharyses and said in
ypocrysy / if they had been in their days they should not have been slain / but
they gave the counsel that Christ should be deed / the head of all saints with
most dyspytyous death. The fendes church in these days / praysen above the
clouds Christ and his holy saints with words and with signs / but they
pursuen to the death the lovers of his law. And thus says Christ in his
gospel. Right as ye done now / so did your fathers to the prophets in their
days. And therefore woe to you hell hounds for Christ says / in this world
ye ben rich fat fed laughing in pursuynge of each other / weep ye and make
ye sorrow for your pain is much in hell. O these shall have a dredefull day
when they be arrayned at the bar of judgment when Christ shall rere up his
cross the baner of his passion. Of this day spekyth the prophet Sophonias.
The great day of the lord is nygh / and fast beside / and hyeth toward
wounders fast / it shall not long tarry / in that day shall be troubled he that
is strong and mighty / for the voice of the lord is bytterful to the dampened.
That day is a day of wrath / a day of trybulacion. That day is a day of hungre
and ire / of extremyte and wretchydnes That day is a day of darkness and of
thycke smoke. That is the day of the trumpe / and of hydeous noise / for than
they shall se their judge above them styrred to wrath / than shall they se
hell open bynethe them / and aungelles on the ryghtsyde hastynge them to hell /
saints approuynge gods dome / and all the world accusynge / and their own
conscyens as opyn as a book / in the which they shall read their own
dampnacyon. These wretches beholdynge the great glory of them that they
despised in this world / than shall they say these words. These been they
whom we some time had in scorn / and in hate and derisyon / we wytles dampened
hell hounds believed that their life had been woodnes / and madness / and
supposyd that their end had been without worship / how now they ben counted
among the sons of god / and they taken their lotte among his saints /
therefore we have erred from the way of truth and the light of ryghtwysenesse
lyghted not to us / we been weary of the way of wyckednes and dampnacyon / what
profit has our pride done to us? or great auaunte or bost of richesse / what
has it given to us? all tho things been passed from us as a shadow. Than the
judge shall say unto them with a stern chere. Go ye away from me ye cursed
lymmes / into the fire of hell everlasting / that is ordained to the devil
and his aungelles. Than may the soul say to the body these words. Come on
thou cursed careyne / come and go with me / I am compelled to come again to
the / that we may go to geder either to others shame / to take our joys as we
have deseruyd / pain for evermore. That thing that we loved / now it is gone
from us / and all that we hated is come upon us / now is joy turned into
sorrow / and our myrthe into weeping / now is our laughter turned into
mourning / and all our game into weylynge / nothing abides to us / but fire
hot brennynge / water cold chyllynge / worms and edders / toodes and snakes
/ ever gnawyng / ever dyenge and never deed / darkness palpable (that is so
thycke / that it may be felt) wantyng the sight of all comeforte / seeing al
thing that may dyscomforte / fire intolerable / dread vntellable / quaking of
ye fendes fellowship always discord wont any frendshyp / and full despeyre of
any end / nevertheless / assay we in this life / if we may leave this fendes
church / and bring our self both body and soul into the church of Jesus
Christ / while grace and mercy may be granted / ask we of him / that offryd
him self upon a cross with a wylfull chere to save us all when we were lost
/ for thus it is written of the words of god / that he spekyth to a synnefull
soul. Turn the again / turn the again: thou synnefull soul: turn the
again / turn again that we may behold the / forsothe god knowyth thy
mysgouernaunce / and will not forsake the / if thou wylt turn again / as he
says by the prophet Ieremye / forsothe thou haste do fornycacyon with many
lovers / nevertheless turn thou to me says the lord / and I shall receive
the / and take the to grace. Upon this says saint Gregory. In this god showith
how much he louyth us / for when we forsaken him / he forsakyth not us. As
saint Austen says. O man mystruste thou not of the mercy of god / for more is
his mercy / than thy wretchedness. And thus says king Dauyd to Abner. when
Abner had send messengers to king Dauyd / to entreat him of fryndshyp /
king Dauyd answered to the messangers / as spoken unto Abner / I will gladly
make frendshype with the / but this one thing I tell the forsooth thou shall not
se my face / till thou shall bring with the Michol / and so coming thou shall
se me / this saying is thus shortly to mean / ye that woll have king Dauyd /
amercyful lord to you / ye must bring with you this woman Mychol / if ye
woll se his gracyous face / for Dauyd loved much this woman as the story
tellethe. Dauyd the king in this place berith the figure of Jesus Christ. And
Mychol is to say when it is declared the water of all / than is this thus to
mean / ye that desyren in all your heart to find and have the mercy of god /
and se his gracyous face in bliss / ye must have water of very penance from
your heart with full contrycyon of will never to turn to syn / and if that ye
