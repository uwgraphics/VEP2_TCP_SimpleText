THE Christian against the Jesuit.

Wherein the secret or namelesse writer of a pernicious book, entitled A
Discovery of I. Nicols Minister etc. privily printed, covertly cast abrod, and
secretly sold, is not only justly reproved:

But also a book, dedicated to the Queens Majesty, called A persuasion from
papistrie, therein derided and falsified, is defended by Thomas Lupton the
author thereof.

Read with aduisement, and judge uprightly: and be affectioned only to truth.

He has made a grave and dug it, but he himself will fall into the pit
which he has made. Psalm. 7. Seen and allowed.

Imprinted at London for Thomas Woodcocke dwelling in Paul's Church yard, at
the sign of the black Bear. 1582.

To the right honorable Sir Francis Walsingham, knight, principal Secretary
to her Majesty, and one of her highness most honorable privy Council:
Thomas Lupton wishes earthly prosperity and heavenly felicity.
AS there is, has been and will be (right honorable) both Wheat and Darnel,
Corn and Cockle, and good Seeds and tares: even so there has been, is, and
will be sowers of both sorts. For the children of God do sow the good corn of
Gods word: and the servants of Satan have and will, scatter abroad Darnel, the
Devils doctrine. But as the godly sowers shall dwell for ever with God, whose
good seed they did sow: Sothe throwers abroad of the Darnell, shall dwell with
the Devil, except they cease from their sowing. Yet they (like senseless
Swine) will needs wallowe in the puddle of perdition, though they are
theeatned with the scriptures for the same. Both which sowers are so different
at this day, that they that have any glimmering at all: may know the good
sowers from the evil, the godly from the wicked, and the true from the false.
Notwithstanding, these wicked sowers of the devils darnell, go about as much
as in them lie: to persuade us that they are the true sowers, and that their
Cockle is pure and good corn. But whose sowers they are, and whose seed they
do sow: all they that are guided by Gods word, do right perfectly know.
And as there has been a wonderful rabble of Satanicall sowers from the
beginning, ever seeking to choke the good corn of Gods word, with their
devilish Darnell: so there has sprung up not long since, a seditious sect of
Satanical sowers, seeking by all means; to choke or suppress the good corue
with their cockle, and the Gospel of Christ, with the doctrine of the Devil.
And these are they that call themselves Jesuits, but they rather deserve to be
called Iudaites: for they follow Judas in betraying, not Jesus in saving. One
of which number (as it should seem) has made a pernicious book in praise of
the Pope and Papistrie, and in reproach of M. Nicols, lately converted from
Papistrie to the Gospel, and returned from the Pope to his Prince. But it does
appear that he doubted his docttrine, else he would have set his name to his
book. Wherein also he does detract a book by (...) pende and published,
called A persuasion from papistrie (which I (...) dicated and exhibited to the
Queens (...)) without disprouing or confuting any one part thereof. Whose
namelesse work, in such points as I knew to be false, I have not only taken
upon me to reprove: but also to defend my self and my said book, by him
therein depraved and slandered. And for that I know your honor to be a zealous
favorer of the Gospel, a perfect professor of Gods word, and an affable
Magistrate (whose wisdom and learning is such, that you can easily try, truth
from falsehood, and right from wrong) I have chosen you to be a Judge between
a Christian and a Jesuit. Beseeching you to pardon me for my boldness
herein, assuring your honor, that your common commendations, and the good
will I bear you: has made me to do that, that discretion and modesty
should have made me refuse. But though my baseness does not deserve such a
Judge: yet the cause which is Christ's does crave such a one. Humbly requesting
you (though your affairs be great and your leisure little) to read and peruse
the same as occasion will serve and time will permit. Trusting, that your
reading thereof, will be more delightful than tedious, and will rather
recreate you than weary you. And thus ceasing herein any further to trouble
your honor: I do wish you in this life to be guided by God, and after, to
reign for ever with Christ.

Your Honors most humble, and faithful to command. Thomas Lupton.

The Christian against the Jesuit.
The first part.
FOrasmuch as you an unknown Jesuit I. part.
and without name, have derided or rather slaundered a book by me lately
framed and published, with my name unto it, called A persuasion from Papistrie,
dedicated and exhibited to the Queens Majesty: which you have done in your
book privily printed and covertly cast abroad in corners, entitled: A
discovery of I. Nicols Minister, misreported a Jesuit, etc.

A doubt not but herein so to defend the same, that it shall be to your
reproach and discredit, yea and also to your shame (if you will be ashamed) to
lie or write against the manifest truth. But you, and they of your sect have
put on such unshamefast faces, that nothing can make you blush. And if I know
your name as well as your noughtie nature, your person as well as your peevish
profession, and your resting place, as well as your ridiculous religion: I
would not only have named you herein, but also would have sent you this answer
by some trusty messenger. But seeing you have in your worthy work, neither
uttered your name, nor the place where you dwell: (whereby I must needs
conjecture that either you look for no answer, or (...) not to be answered,
or think it not worth the answering,) Therefore, as it was written at Athens
unto the unknown God, Acts. 17.
so must I now be enforced to write unto the unknown Jesuit. Being very
doubtful how to convey this your undesired or unlooked for answer unto you,
for that you have neither name nor dwelling place.

If I should direct it to no body, dwelling no where, (which is the fittest
place for a namelesse person to dwell in) I should (...) or never get any to
convey the same unto you. But I comfort my self with this one thing, though in
your said discovery you have covered your name, that neither her Majesty, her
counsel, nor diverse other that would gladly confer with you, can tell
whither to send unto you; yet your secret (...) of your sect (I hope) know
you well enough, and where you are resident. (...) though thieves by all means
possibly hide them selves for fear to be taken: yet thieves and purloyners of
their own trade, know well enough where to have them. Whereby I am in good hope
that one or other of your secret friends will help to convey it unto you:
though you were out of England, as I (...) rather you are within the Realm in
some one corner or other. Not doubting but that you that are the namelesse
Author of this discovery, will shortly be discovered your self: (if you be
not already) as some of your fellows have been of late, that thought
themselves so safely covered, yt they hoped, not so sone to be discovered,
whereby your name may be known: unless you change your name with your
religion, as your holy father does when he comes to be Pope.

The Prophets, Christ's Apostles, and many learned Martyrs and holy men, did
set their names to their works and writings: which I think you would have
done if you had been of their religion. But you both doubting your religion,
and fearing to be found out and punished if you were known, wrought very
circu^spectly to conceal your name: yea and if it were reproved, yet thereby
small disprayse or rebuke could happen to you, because you are nameles (but I
think not altogether shameless, for that I suppose the shame of your cause
has made you to cover your name.) Surely you deal very discourteously with
me to have me at such advantage, for you deride and slander my work without
confuting, whereby undeserved I may (...) reproach of some that know me: But if
I (...) your book, you can receive no rebuke thereby of such as know you,
though you deserve the same.

He may be called very well a (...), (...) one that (...) strusteth his own
strength, that stands privily in a dark corner, and (...) a man, and so
runs away, whereby it cannot be known who wounded him: In this sort you
have dealt with thee because I am named and known, and you namelesse, and
(therefore in this respect) unknown. And also hereby M. Nicols, I and other are
in greater danger then is before mentioned, for we may be in doubt, by you
(...) some of your sect, to be privily stabde in with a daggar, dispatche
with a dagge, or otherwise privily killed or murdered: for they that will not

prison from whence they could not (...): (as Sherwood did of late a stout
soldier of the Popes) it is not like they will (...) to kill the professors
of Gods word, whom they mortally hate and that know them not, being at
liberty, whereby they unknown, may hope to escape. But if you should go
about thus to use us, yet we doubt not but that God would as well preserve us,
as the Devil should procure you.

If you had perused my book as circumspectly and indifferently, as you read it
disdainfully and contemptuously, and if you had been as much addicted to truth,
as you were bent to error: you would rather have thankt me than taunted me,
esteemed me than envied me, and not to have charged me with lies that have
uttered the truth.

If my book be so vain as you vaunte, and so untrue as you term it: then
belike this your book (clean repugnant to it) is the Lantern of learning,
the touch stone of truth, and the welspring of wit. But until I be better
resolved that mine is so false as you feyne, and yours so true as you troue: I
will be so bold (though something slightly) to write in the defense of my
doings. And though to my reproach you have written to other: to your discredit
I have written to your self. Being very sorry that you have urged me unto (...)
and also it pitieth me that you employ your wit so vainly, and your cunning
in such a cause. Great learning and wit will hardly defend a (...): But small
(...) with wisdom, will easily maintain a truth:

And now for that you have written your said book chiefly against matter
Nicols, I will leave all that which you have discovered to his (...) and
discreadite, for him self to answer: who is best able to approve his own
sayings, and to unburden himself of such untruths, as it seems you charge
him withal. Meaning briefly in order from the beginning of your book, to
repugne such of your sayings as I am able (...) reprove: and also to defend
mine own book, which you so maliciously have staundered.

The title of your book is (as is before said) A discovery of I. Nicols
Minister, etc. I think by this your discovery, you will be discovered to
your further discredit.

You have named him minister, a name of reproach, with many of your sect, but a
Minister of Gods word, and of the holy Sacraments, have been and will be,
esteemed with the godly, above Papisticall Priests, maintainers and mumblers
of the Mass, that is most injurious to the death of Christ. If Christ had
thought it had been a name of reproach, he would not have said these words
to his Disciples, It shall not be so among you, but whosoever will Matthew. 20.
be great among you, let him be your Minister, etc. The Angels of God were
ministers, for they ministered to Mark 1.
Christ in the wilderness. Also Christ himself came to minister, for thus
he says, for even the son of man came Mark 10.
not to be ministered unto, but to minister, etc. Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James did minister Mark. 15.
unto Christ. It is no evil or hateful name to be the minister of Christ,
(unless it be evil to be where John. 12.
Christ is.) For Christ says, If any man minister unto more, let him follow
me, and where I am, there shall also my minister be. The Apostles office and
Acts. 1.
function was great and holy, and yet Peter counted it a ministration. The
Apostles called the preaching of the (...) of God, yt ministration of Gods word
seying, we will give our Acts. 6.
selves continually to (...) and to the ministration of the word. Here the
Apostles disdeyned not to call themselves ministers of Gods word. If a
minister were such a reproachful name as you and your sectaries would make it,
Saint Mark would not have taken that name upon him: for he was minister to
Paul and Barnabas, for thus says the text, Acts 13.
And they had John to their minister, (which was Mark the Evangelist.)

The holiest priest of the Pope was never made Priest in such order as S. Paul
was made a minister, for if the Pope have made any, yet he made them priests
on the earth: but Jesus Christ him self made S. Paul a minister, yea and that
out of heaven, which S. Paul reports him self saying, I saw in the way a
light from heaven, above the bright Acts 23.
nesse of the sun, shine round about me, and them which iourneyd with me:
when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and
saying in the Hebrewe tongue, Saul Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard
for thee to kick against the prick. And I said who art thou Lord? And he
said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, but rise and stand upon thy feet. For
I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a
witness of those things which thou have seen. Thus it is manifest that Jesus
Christ him self out of heaven made S. Paul a minister.

When you can show me that any of your priests have been made priests, by a
better man and in a better place then S. Paul was made a minister, then I will
esteem your priests above our ministers: but until that time, I will
reverence and esteem our ministers of gods word, above your papisticall and
Idolatrous priests. And as it is manifest that, minister, was a comendable
name and that it was (...) in Christ's and the Apostles time, so it appears
that there were ministers in Chrysostomes time, and that it was (...) thought
to be a name of contempt: for S, John (...) Chrysostom. in act. Homil. 19.
(...) thus, Stat minister and communis minister and alta vose (...), etc. The
minister and the common minister stands up and cries out with a loud voice,
saying, keep silence, and give ear, after that the reader begins the
prophecy of Esaie. Therefore if you weigh well the words before written
concerning ministers, you have no great occasion to despise the name of a
minister.

Misreported (you say) a lesuit as though you think him far unworthy of
that name, if you do think him not worthy to be a Jesuit, no more do I. for
I take him to be the child of God, and therefore not meet to be a Jesuit.
And now for that it seems you are a Iesutte, because you would not have
Master Nycols to be of the Jesuits society: (which you take beelike to be
the best of all other) I trust you will not be dispuleased that I name my self
a Christian, wherewith I am right well content. Assured that the true (...) of
a christian (which was instituted by Christ almost Sextien hundredth years
since) shall always be able to counterueyle the Superstition of a Jesuit, of
which religion and society, one Ignatius Layola a Spaniarde of Biskay, was the
first founder, beginner, and captain not fifty years since. And though you
hold by the first name of our high friend and redeemer which is Jesus: yet
we hold by his second name which is Christ, much musing what Spirit should
incense you, to leave the ancient name of a Christian, which many thousands
of martyrs and other Godly and learned men have most defirously embraced, and
gladly retained: whom God has ever since Christ's time preserved, prospered
and blessed, among which I never heard nor readde, that any of them were
called Jesuits. Whereof you may see a manifest proof (if you will) by the
prosperity of our prince, her godly government, her peaceable reign, and her
wonderful Success, who is the chief defendresse of us and this our
Christian religion under God, for read all the Cronicles with the conference
of tunes, and you shall not find that ever any prince or kingedome have been
more blessed. Which prosperity and blessings, God does not commonly bestow
upon heretics, as you do term us: for on his enemies and Heretyltes, (I
must not say Jesuits) he sends commonly his Curses, plagues, wars,
dearth, scarcity, and trouble, with all kind of evil success: By which
tokens and marks, you may know your selves, and how that God does not
favor neither you nor your doings. For what success have your practices?
your devises are daily revealed, your conspiraces are prevented, your treasons
are bewrayed, your power diminished, your Soldiers against her highness in
Irelande discomfited and killed, your captains and crewe discovered, and all
your other doings turn to your own destruction. And that the same may more
plainly appear, by the prosperouse success of the true Christians on the
one side, and the evil success of Gods Enemies on the other side: I have by
infallible arguments and examples plainly proved in my said book called A
persuasion from papistrie that we have the true religion, and you the wrong:
every indifferent reader whereof cannot choose but confess. But I think I
understand wherefore you have chosen rather the name of Jesus than the name of
Christ, and that is this as I take it: For as much as your papisticall or
Jesuitical religion does teach that you may be your own Saviors by your good
works, masses, the Popes pardons, and other such trumperie: yea and by
whipping of your selves as shall appear hereafter. I think therefore you
have chosen to be called Jesuits of Jesus (which signifeth a Savior) the
first name of our redeemer Christ, importing thereby to be your own
Saviors. So that you shall not need that he shall be your Savior, but your
sesues: (according as your Romish doctrine does allow) But we, because we are
most sure that none can be our Savior, but Jesus Christ, therefore we are
content to yield over yt name of Jesus to him self, thinkinge our selves far
unworthy to be named thereby, and are most glad to be entitled by his second
name Christ, which signifies vnctus, that is anointed, and so to be called
Christians. Knowing that we can do no good thing unless we be spirituallye
anointed, comforted, and learned or inspired by the holy spirit of God the
holy ghost. And yet it may be, that you name your selves Jesuits of Jesus the
Son of Siracke, or of some other Jesus of your own allowing: which may be
the Pope, who by his own laws has all power in heaven and earth, and by the
sayings of Simon Begnius, is your savior, for he said to Pope Leo, Behold the
Lion is come of the tribe of Judah Council. later. sessi. 6. page 604.
the root of David etc. O most blessed Leo, we have looked for thee to be our
Savior. Whereby (if it be so, but you are worse then mad if you believe so)
he may be your Jesus, and so you his Jesuits (as you are in deed.) Or rather, I
think you name your selves (...) of your Jesus of bread that is of your own
making, which you say and swear, is the very body, soul, and (...) of Jesus
Christ our savior. But because my said book has manifestly proved that
your Jesus of bread is but a plain cake, whereby you are most falsely (...),
therefore you deride and discommend it, yt it should not be read. Perhaps you
will say yt you are no Jesuit, and therefore I misname you: in deed you have
not named your self to be a Jesuit, wherefore I can not much blame you: for
you that are loath to utter your first Christian name and the old ancient name
of your progenitors and auncetors: it is no marvel though you hide your last
name (Jesuit,) which is but lately sprung up and counterfeite. But by all
conjectures you are a Jesuit, partly for that you so mightily write in their
defense and against him that has reproved them: and partly for that you have
flourished your book in the first front thereof with the name of Jesus,
(howesoeuer it is furnished with his word) which makes a great show
outwardly howesoeuer it is inwardly. Which name of Jesus is so environed with
fiery and cloven tongues, (as it should seem) that he has a very hard
heart, that will not believe, that every Jesuit when he speaks has the holy
ghost upon him in the liknesse of fiery and cloven tongues, as the Apostles
had soon after Christ's ascension.

Truly this your papisticall and Iesuitical religion consists only in name
and outward vain (...): which are bables to bring babes a bed, but far in
sufficient to intise the wise to your ways. You know that all they that say
Math. 7.
Lord Lord shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, but they that do the
will of God. There will some say to Christ, Math. 7.
did not we work miracles and cast out devils in thy name? but Christ will say
unto them, away ye workers of iniquity for I know you not. If Christ will
use them thus that cast out devils out of men in the name of Jesus: what will
he do to you that fill men full of devils under the name of Jesus? Be no more
blind but see, it is not the naming of your selves by the name of Jesus, that
will make you blessed: but the embracing and following the doctrine of Jesus.
Therefore esteem not the cross more then Christ: nor traditions more than
truth: lest Jesus Christ say unto you, away ye workers of iniquity for I
know you not. You and we have professed in our Baptisine to forsake the devil
and all his works, and to be true Christians the soldiers and servants of
christ, which we promised to perform: but you (if you be a (...)) and the rest
of that sect, have broken the same in that you are become Iesuices, and have
forsaken the name and religion of a Christian, mentioned in the Gospel. And
because you will be sure not to return back again to Christ, nor become
Christians: you have made a great oath, to observe the orders, rules, and
religion of the same, which is clean contrary to the law of Christ as shall
appear by the particular points of your oath. O what a wicked devil is this
that thus does be witch you? To keep the laws of Christ, and to continue in
his service, you make but a (...) (...) which you break every day: but to
continue in a (...) devised society clean contrary to ye Gospel of Jesus
Christ, (which will lead you to hell) you make a great (...), which nothing
can cause you to break.

And to the intent that every one may see that read this (if they (...) not
wilfully blind) that the oath you take, is (...) pugnaut and directly against
the law of our savior (...) Christ: I have here (...) the same, not only to
make (...) ashamde to (...) the name of Jesus, whose law you deeply swear to
resist, but also that the indifferent reader hereof may perfectly perceive,
that though outwardely you show your selves by your name of Jesuits to be the
followers and friends of Jesus: yet inwardly you are mortal enemies of Jesus,
and that you are the servants, or rather bondslaues of satan. And this is
the oath of you Jesuits that follows.

I. N. do firmly admit and embrace the Apostolic The oath of the Jesuits.
Bullapiiquarti super ordinatione and promotione doctorum, and aliorum
cuiuscunque artis et facoltatis professorum. etc.
and ecclesiastical traditions, and the rest of the observations and
constitutions of the same Church. Also I do admit the holy Scripture,
according unto that sense, which the holy mother the Church has and does hold
it, to whom it appertains to judge of the true sense and interpretation of
holy Scriptures, neither will I ever receive or interpret it, but according to
the uniform consent of the fathers. I do also profess that there are truly
and properly seven Sacraments of the new law, ordained by Jesus Christ our
Lord, and for the salvation of mankind, though not all to every one
necessary, to wit, baptism, confirmation, The Lords Supper, penance,
extreme unction, order and matrimony, and that they confer grace: And of
them, baptism, confirmation, and order, without sacralidge, may not be
reiterated. I do also receive and admit the received and allowed rytes of
the Catholic Church in the solemn administration of all the before said
Sacraments. I do embrace and receive all and every the things; which of
original sin and justification have bin defined and decreed in the holy
Synod of Trent. I profess in like sort, that in the Mass there is offered
unto God the true proper propiciatorie Sacrifice for quick and dead: And that
in the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, there is truly, really and
substantially, the body and blood together with the Soul and divinity of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and that there is a conversion of the whole substance of
bread into the body, and the whole substance of wine into blood, the which
conversion the catholic church calls transubstanciatio^. I confess withal,
that under one only kind whole and perfect Christ, and the true sacrament is
received. I do constantly hold purgatory, and that the souls there detained,
are relieved by the prayers of the faithful, and in like sort, that the saints
raining together with Christ, are to be honored and called upon, and that they
pray unto God for us, and that their relyques are to be worshipped. I do
firmly avouch, that the images of Christ, and the mother of God always a
virgin, and also of other saints are to be had and retained, and that we are to
give them due honor and worship. I do affirm, that the faculty of pardons
has been left by Christ in the church, and that the use of them is very
wholesome to christian people. I do acknowledge the holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church of Rome, for the mother and mistress of all churches. I do
promise and swear obedience to the bishop of Rome, successor of blessed
Peter, prince of the apostles, and vicar of Jesus Christ. I do also
undoubtedly receive and profess all that have bin delivered, defined and
declared by the holy canons and general councels, and specially by the holy
Synod of Trent, and withal all things contrary and heresies whatsoever have
by the church bin condemned, rejected and accursed, I also do condemn, reject,
and accurse. This true catholic faith, without the which none can be saved,
the which I do presently willingly profess, and truly hold, the same wholly
and immaculate unto the last gasp most co^constantly retain, teach and preach
as much as in me (...) lie, I the same N. do promise, vow, and swear, so God me
help, and the holy Gospel s of God.

Are not you the true folowers and disciples of Jesus that makes this oath, or
swears to keep and perform al these articles until your last gasp: O most
mad and bewitched jesuits, what an oath and vow do you make here: Jesus by whom
you name your selves Jesuits (that only can and must be our Savior) you have
clean left out, and never make me^tio^ in this your oath, of your obeying of
him nor of his word: But of the Pope and of the Church of Rome, with pardons,
relics, worshipping of images and such other tru^pery, that is quite contrary
and repugnant to ye law and co^ma^deme^t of Jesus Christ our redeemer. And in
this your detestable oath you swear to continue and hold this damnable doctrine
until your last gasp because (as I said before), of set purpose you will not
return to Christ. But I (...) God of his (...) goodness (if it be his blessed
will) (...) (...) your hearts with his holy spirit, that you (...) this (...)
and dangerous way you are in and (...) (...) with (...) from this your society
of Satan (as M. Nicols has done) whereby you may be of the true church of
(...), and so to be yt children of God. I need not go about to (...) these your
points of your Papistical religion, whereunto you are sworn: partly for that
the simplest soul that can but read, may see how contrary your profession is
to Gods word and the Gospel of Christ, but chiefly for that by many and
profound learned men, by the holy scriptures, and by invincible arguments,
they are confounded, vanquished and beaten down, besides in my said book
called (A (...) from papistrie) the chiefest points of your religion, are
proved false, wicked, detestable, vain, foolish, childishe and rydiculous.
But least mysilence should make you say, that I would have confuted the
particular points of your said oath if I could, shortly therefore (God
willing) I will set forth and publishe a brief treatise touching the same
which shall (...) (...) falsely you are foresworne by this your horrible oath,
wherein (through Gods help) by your own four marks, and three properties,
which you produce in your said discovery, to prove your Church of Rome to
be the true Church; your said Church of Rome shall be plainly proved, to be
none of Christ's Church, but to be the Synagogue of Satan. And as you have
gone about, to discredit my said book by this your discovery, so I will God
willing therein disprove your said oath and you, by some paricular parts of my
said book by you slandred, as it shall appear manifestly to the indifferent
reader. And (...) that I have discovered your detestable and horrible (...),
whereby the meaning of this your discovery may (...) be (...) I will proceed
(God willing) to repugne some particular (...) of your book, and to defend
mine (...), (...) the rest for M. (...) to (...) (as I said before) who
chiefly knows his own cause, and (...) best able (...) (...) (...).

The second part.
TO the intent you would have your simple Reader 2. part.
think, that you have the name of Jesus in great reverence (though you despise
his doctrine) you have on the one side of your flourished Jesus placed these
words of Saint Paul, God has exalted him, and given him a Phil. 2. ver. 9.
name which is above all names. If you think that S. Paul meant these words
on Jesus Christ (as most certainly he did) the^ why should you not (...) yt his
doctrine is above all doctrines: It is a strange matter that you should
reverence the name of Jesus, and detest and forswear the doctrine of Jesus.
Surely if a man detest a man's deeds or doctrine, I cannot think that he does
love or favor his name: for he that hates a man's doings or doctrine, will
have no great lust to hear of his name. Nay the hearing of his name, will make
him straight way to speak evil of his person. Therefore if you love the name
of Jesus, you will not swear to renounce the doctrine of Jesus: but because
you have sworn to forsake the doctrine of Jesus, therefore (say what you will)
you cannot love the name of Jesus. Wherefore unless you receive the doctrine of
Jesus, and believe only to be saved by him, at your last gasp, he will say to
you at the last day (though you tell him the^ yt you are Jesuits and hold of
his name) away ye works of iniquity for I know you not.

The third part.
ON the other side of this your flourished name of Jesus, 3. part.
you have set these words of Saint (...) in the Acts of the (...), whereby
you would (...) the people think, that all you do, is by the (...) of God:
when (God knows) you (...) all thing (...) quite (...) to the same, and
swears (for state of (...)) that you will withstand the same until your last
(...), (...) (...) are the words, There is no other name under heaven given
Acts. 4. ver. 12.
unto men, wherein we must be saved. Saint Peter by these words shows him
self to be no good Procter for the Pope, though the Pope takes him for his
chief pillar and Patron. Except Peter meant nothing by these words, or that
they must have none other sense then the Church of Rome will allow, (for the
scriptures by the saying of Cardinal Cusanus has no right sense nor meaning,
but that the Church of Rome does allow, and also by your meaning, or else you
would not swear so deeply to admit the holy Scripture according to that
sense which your holy mother the Church, has and does hold.) And so you may
make the sense and meaning thereof to fall out thus, There is none other name
under heaven given unto men whereby we must be saved: that is to say, There is
no salvation without the Church of Rome, or that none can be saved without
the catholic faith of the Church of Rome: If this were Peter's meaning, or that
the giving of the sense thereof is referd to the Church of Rome, whereby to
expound them thus or which way they list: Then it is like this name of Jesus
will do you Jesuits great pleasure, or else if Saint Peter meant thus by the
same words, or that the Church of Rome has power to expound them thus, There
is none other name under heaven given unto men, (...) in we must be saved:
that is to say, if we carry or wear upon us the name of Jesus, either
printed, written, graven, sowed, or embroidered, or otherwise (...), then I
will not say, but that the bare name of Jesus would save both Jesuits and
Jews, for then, Jesuits, Jews, Turks, Sarrizins, Heathen, Infidels, and all
other be they never so wicked may have the name of Jesus sowed or set on their
garments, and then they should be safe, and so saved by the name of Jesus. Or
else if Peter's or the Popes meaning be, that the naming of Jesus (without any
other thing) will save us, then I will not say, but that the only naming of
Jesus will save both Jesuits, Jews, Gentiles, yea and Devils also: for the
Devils that possessed the two men, to whom Christ gave leave to go into the
heerde of Swine, did name Jesus, saying, O Jesus thou son of God, etc. And
therefore Math. (...).
if naming of Jesus will serve the turn, then Devils and all may be saved. But
it is not the setting of the name of Jesus flourished as it were with fiery
tongues in your books, nor the textes of scripture magnifying the name of
Jesus, nor the wearing on you the name of Jesus in your Agnus deis, or your
gospels, or other such like, nor ye feigned naming of Jesus: but the following
of the doctrine of (...) and believing only in Jesus. For so did the Pharisees
and the Saduces, brag and boast of Abraham as you do of Jesus: yet for all
that holy John Baptist could not abide them, but called them generation of
vipers, saying, O generation of Math. 3.
vipers, who has taught you to flee the vengeance to come? (as though they
could not flee from it, because they were not taught by Christ, or that they
thought to flee from it by the traditions of men, not by the word of God) Do
therefore (says he) the fruits of repentance, and think not in your selves,
we have Abraham to our father, etc. Therefore boast not nor brag too much of
the name of Jesus, as the Pharisees and Saduces did of Abraham, neither follow
the traditions of the Church of Rome, as they did ye traditions of their
elders: But follow the doctrine of Jesus, and believe only in Jesus. For
according to Christ's words, Not all they that say Jesus Math. 7.
Jesus shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but they that do the will of
Jesus, which is in heaven. Whose will can never be done, unless we hear or
read the last will of Jesus, which is the holy Gospel.

The fourth part.
AND under the name of Jesus, you have placed these 4. part.
words of the (...). of Salomo^. A lying witness shall have an evil end. As
though your Jesuitical (...) were nothing but truth, and yt professors thereof
did never make lie: and as though our religion were altogether false, and in
the professors thereof were nothing but falsehood. But if evil ends are
special marks (according to Solomon) of lying witnesses: then you that are
Jesuits have no great cause to boast that you are true witnesses.

And now for that you grant that a lying witness has an evil end, then
they that have evil ends are not like to be true witnesses: and so by this
means, Sherwood and Ducket that dyed so dangerously and had so evil an end of
late (though they professed your Romish religion and did hold on the Pope)
were lying witnesses. And seeing they were lying witnesses, the thing they
witnessed was a lie, and so, by your own sayings in the first front of your
book of this your discovery, you have discovered your Romish religion, which
they witnessed at their last gasp to be a lie. And as you have proved here by
Solomon that Sherwood and Ducket were lying witnesses by their evil end: So
Persuas. from papistrie.
I have showed in my said book called, A persuasion from papistrie: Diverse of
your Romish religion that had evil Page 289.
(...), (because they were lying witnesses) but least you should forget them, I
will put you in remembrance of some of them. John de Roma a professor of your
Romish religion, an enemy to the Gospel, and a great (...) thereof, (for he
filled boots with boiling grease, and so put them on the Gospellers legs,
tying them backward to a form with their legs hauging down over a small
fire to torment them the more, and so examined them,) (through the vengeance of
God) rotted and swarmed full of vermin, not able to abide his own smell, so
that his flesh fell away from his bones by peecemeale, whose end and death was
most horrible and evil, and therefore by your own judgment, he was a lying
witness.

and had an (...) end, and therefore according to your own sentence he was a

member of your Romish Church, that condemned the Lord Cobham a true
professor of the Gospel, his tongue did so swell, that he could swallow no
meat, and so dyed and had an evil end, and therefore by your own doom he
was a lying witness.

Also a certain Bishop of Hungary a mighty mainteiner Page (...).
of your popish religion, and a false witness against the Gospel, did run
about stark mad, and rauing, died miserably, and so he had an evil end,
and therefore he was a lying witness.

of the professors and witnesses of Gods word, fell down suddenly to the
ground with a (...) groan, and never (...) after, neither showed any token of
repentance, and so he had an evil end, and therefore by your own saying he
was a lying witness.

A great sort of such are described at large in the latter end of my said
book, whereby it does most manifestly appear that the said professors of your
Romish religion were false witnesses, because they had an evil end. And so
your romish doctrine is false, because the professors, mainteiners and
defenders are lying witnesses. And now as lying witnesses are tried by their
evil ends: so, true witnesses are known by their good ends. And because the
pure and perfect professors of Gods word (our religion) have good ends,
therefore they are true witnesses. And as I have proved a great fort of your
Romish religion by my said book, to be false and lying witnesses because of
their evil ends: so have I in the latter end of the said book, proved
diverse professors of this our religion to be true witnesses, for that they
had good ends. For they that suffered for the Gospel, were in their torments
most patient and constant, who^ God did myraculously aid, help and strengthen
until the yielding up of their spirit. Which if you had read as advisedly, as
I fear you omitted purposely: you should soon have spied, the^ of your
religion to be lying witnesses by their evil ends, and them of our religion to
be true witnesses, by their good ends.

If you would stick to this saying of Salomo^ produced by you, and consider
the most wicked and dangerous deaths, and horrible, desperate and evil ends
of your sectaries and professors of your religion: you would the^ say yt the
(...) and Papists are lying witnesses. Therefore have a better consideration of
the same words of Solomon: and then you shall plainly perceive that you are
wounded with your own arrowe, and that you have shot your selves through with
Salomons shafte.

The (...) part.
Under the said sentence of the Proverbs of Solomon, 5. part.
you have placed these words of Saint Barnard, An no^ ex hac odiosa
impudentia, pullulabit mox Bernard. ser. 4.2. in Can.
impenitentia matter desperationis? Will not impenitencie the mother of
desperation, shortly breed or spring of this hateful impudency? Hereby you
would have your Readers believe, that the professors of the Gospel and they
that speak or write against you in the defense thereof, are so without all
shame, that it will bring the^ shortly to impenitencie and then to desperation.
I would the less blame you for bringing this text of S. Barnarde against us,
if you could show but one of the earnest professors, followers, and
continuers of the Gospel, that dyed impenitently and desperately, as I have
alleged a great sort (in my said book by you slaundered) and can do many
mo, of your Romish and Papisticall religion that have died most horribly,
wickedly and desperately. But because you are not able to do it, you seek by
one that is of more credit the^ your self, to discredit us. But as you shoot
without his consent, so you shoot his shaft here at a wrong mark: for he
shoots not this arrowe at us, nay he shoots it at you. For if you Jesuits
and Papists be impudent lying witnesses against the manifest truth of the
Gospel, and have an evil end, dying impenitently and desperately: Then does
not the text show plainly, that S. Barnard has hit you, and not touched us:
Yes I think. And that it may appear whether this text of S. Barnarde does hit
your selves or not (though you shoot it at us) I will here briefly note some
examples of the impenitent and desperate deaths of some of the champions of
your Romish Church, which I have produced in my said book concerning the
same.

thereby brought to desperation.

whereby he was burned for professing the gospel: was soon after so stricke^ by
the power of God, yt his meat would not go down, but rise and pick up again,
sometimes at his mouth, sometime blown out at his nose, most hor rible to
behold, and so he continued until his death. Whereby it is more like that he
was impenitent, and thereby brought to desperation.

desperately, for all he had the Cardinals blessing.

These with diverse more of your Romish religion that had such evil ends, and

they seem never so great and strong) can neither hurt us nor stir us. Nay

of very bare brokers, to extol immoderatly very base wares, etc. If
extollers, of very base wares are very bare brokers, (...) by this your own
saying, you Jesuits and Papists are not only the (...), but also the baddest
and falsest brokers of all other: for you (...) Masses, and say they will save
us, you prefer the Popes pardons, and pronounce them as precious, you praise
your romish relickes, and affirm they will relieve us, and also that your
oil will work our salvation: with diverse other of the Popes wares which you
extol to be so excellent and pure, that none other wares on the earth but
they, can work the like wonders.

But for that Gods word does not warrant these your wares, neither the
prophets do proclaim them, neither Christ does command them, nor the
Apostles do allow them, nor the Evangelists did once (...) them: Therefore
howsoever you Jesuits do extol them, we christians must needs despise them.
And now as these your popish wares are proved base and badde wares, because
they are neither commanded, nor commended by Christ: so you must needs (...)
but very bare brokers, nay detestable and diuelishe deceauers, for if they may
justly be called dissemblers and deceauers, rather then noughtie brokers, that
set forth and extol, vellewres for velvet, sackcloth for sattan, course harden
for fine linen, brown paper for pure partchment, ale for alligant, and water
for wine: (though they loose not all their money they paid for the same, and
though their said false wares may do them some pleasure,) then you that be
Jesuits and Papists, may rightly be called detestable and diuelishe
deceauers, that extol, praise, preach, and write, masses for Gods mercy,
crosses for Christ, the popes oil for Christ's blood, bread for Christ's body,
the Popes paltrie for Gods pardons, fables for faith, (...) for treasure,
relickes for remission, the decrees of men for the doctrine of God, falshode
for truth, damnation for salvation, and the endelesse pains of hell, for the
everlasting Joys of heaven: which most false and counterfeate wares, through
your praising and extolling of them, the ignorant people do buie them of the
Pope, and pay therefore dearly, to their utter destruction: therefore (all this
well weighed and considered) though you mean by your words that we are bare
brokers: yet here you are descried, to be detestable and diuelishe deceauers,
far worse (...) (...) brokers. And though you count M. Niclos for the base
wares that we the bare brokers do so extol, yet if you advise your self
as well as you should, and no less then we wish, he is not so base a ware as
you take him: (except that be a base ware that is bought with the dearest
price) for how base soever you make him, he cost more the^ all the popes wares
are worth, he cost even the very heart blood of Christ the son of God, yea
and Christ was enforst before he could (...) him, to come out of heaven, into
this earth, and here to pay it and lay it down for him. Therefore if you advise
your self well, M. Nicols is not very base ware. All the masses that you are
able to mumble, nor all the money that they cost (and yet they cost a great
deal in a year) can not buie him, (though you swear they can save both the
quick and the dead).

It seems you take him for base ware, because you count his learning to be
but base, how base soever his learning is now with us, you counted him well
learned when he was with you. Do you think he was better learned when he was
ye pope scholar, then now when he is Christ's disciple? or was his knowledge
more profou^d when he professed ye pope the^ now when he preaches Christ? belike
ye pope (having al laws and Did. 40. si papa, in glossa.
heavenly judgment in his breast) when he came to him, breathed him full of
learning: and now at his coming away, Extra. de tra^s. episcopi.
the Pope took it from him again. You have very good luck, for wicked and
unlearned men (if they please and obey the Pope) Quanto in glossa.
the^ they are godly and learned men: but if they displease and disobey the
pope, then are they wicked and unlearned. It is no marvel, though men that are
living and reasonable creatures (being of the popes religion) be godly and
learned: when dead and senseless things are holy when they come under the
priests fingars: for as long as the goldsmith has the chalis it is not holy,
but every one may touch it with their bare hand: but when the papisticall
priest has once fingarde it, it is so holy, that none may touch it but the
priest, except with a glove, whereby it appears that a calves or sheep
skin, is more precious with your priests, then the skin or bare hand of a man
the image of God. A little cake is of small valewe before the priest have it,
but after he lay hold on it, it is the (...) ly body of Christ; wine is but
wine as long as we have it, but it is yt very blood of Christ when the priest
has once catch it: oil is of small value as long as we have it, but when it
comes to the priests hands, it is equal to christ's blood, and works our
salvation: therefore whatsoever pleases ye pope, is very precious: wherefore
M. Nicols must be content to go now for base ware, as one utterly unlearned,
because he is fled from antichrist to Christ, and from the Pope to his Prince.
But howesoeuer you Jesuits think of his learning, we Christians do not
mislike it, (if it were less) as long as he preaches Christ and is gided by
the gospel. As long as he was one of the popes earthly warehouse, you counted
him most excellent ware: but now yt he is become one of christ's heavenly
treasurehouse, you count him but baggage and trash. It is happy for him yt he
is come out of the popes warehouse: for if he had tarried there but a little
longer, he would have bin a great deal baser then he is, as I am sure he
himself thinks no less, (if one yt has a gilty conscience and a desperate
mind, may be so counted).

The seventh part.
YOu call him a twice revolted minister and a sely gra^maria^. The. 7. part.
How often he has revolted I know not, he is old enough, discou. page 3.
therefore he is able therein to answer for himself: but this I will tell you, it
is better to revolt twice from truth to falsehood, and then to return (...) to
yt truth, and so coutinue in yt same until ye last end: the^ to return from
falshod to truth, and after to revolt by oath from truth to falshod, and so to
continue there in until the last gasp. and now because he is (...) from ye pope
to his prince, you call him a seely gra^maria^, but when he was revolted from
his prince to yt pope, you counted him an (...) scholar. You bear him such a
grudge and detest him so much, (because he is departed from ye pope to his
prince, and from ye Jesuitical sect to the Christian religion) that if he had
not been a good gra^marian in deed, you would never have bestowed yt name of a
seely gra^maria^ upon him: but if he be but a sely gra^marian as you term him,
he is more meet to be a pope, then pope Innocent was to be a prelate, if we
may credit Erasmus, who writes as follows of the said popes answer unto
Inter epi. Au. epi. 91. Eras.
the council of (...): In hac Epistola, etc.

We lack in this Epistle both eloquence, and wit, and learning meet for such a
prelate. Which shows that the same Pope Innocent was neither eloquent, wise,
nor learned. Whereby it seems that M. Nicols, may presume with your pope, for
that you allow him the name of a seely grammarian, and therefore if you look
well on it, M. Nicols is not so base a ware as you count him, unless you mean
to imbase an unlearned Pope.

The eight part. The 8. part.

YOu say, but only for that he surchargeth with slander discou. page 3.
so many other men, yea Princes and States in that his declamation, you could
more willingly have pitted then answered (knowing the man's feeblenes as you
do) etc. It may be that you are so angry with him fortelling of truth, that
rather of malice then matter, and of color then cause, you have taken in
hand to excuse your Pope and his prelates, by accusing him. But though it be
the use of Jesuits to slander true Christians, yet true Christians do not use
to slander Jesuits. And though it pleases the Pope that papists shall belie
protestants, yet it displeases Christ, that protestants shall belie papists.
Wherefore I hardly believe that M. Nicoles (being now become of a faithles
Jesuit, a faithful Christian) will slander any thereby to displease his
master Christ: knowing moreover that hell is the place appointed for liers. So
that whatsoever in this point you charge him withal, I doubt not but he (...)
and will easily discharge him self: but though you allege his slaundring of
other is the cause you answer him, yet I can not believe, but to be preferde
of the Pope, or to be praisde of the papists, (...) rather procurde you to do
it.

It seems, had it not been for the great slander (...) made, you would have
been moved with pity not to have answered him: this is a very sudden change,
I marvel, ye you are now so pinchte with pity in answering one, whose (...)
were wont to be so pitilesse in burning of thousands Well, it was very evil
luck that M. Nicols slaundered so many as he did, else you had not wasted so
much paper as you have done. For his feeblenes which you know (that is his
lack of learning as it should seem) would have eased you of a great deal of
pain that you took with your pen: and perhaps of some punishment that you
deserve of your Prince.

Though it appear by this your writing, that M. Nicols learning is very
feeble, it seems that Erasmus knew also that some of the Popes learned and
School doctors did not Erasmus in scholis in Hieronym. ad Marcellam.
far excel him, for thus does Erasmus write, portenta, quae nunc passim
legimus in commentariis Recentium interpretum, tam impudentia, and insulsa
(...), vt videantur suibus ea scripfisse, non bominibus: The monstrous folies,
that we commonly read in the commentaries of the late Interpreters (meaning
the chief of the Popes doctors) are so far without shame, and so peeuishe,
as if they had been written for swine and not for men. Though you count M.
Nicols learning to be feeble, yet I trust you can not prove, but that his
writing (though you count him a seely gra^maria^) may serve for men and not for
(...). If such as Erasmus writes of had learned enough to be the Popes
doctors: then M. Nicoles has learning enough to be one of ours ministers. It
appears De con distin. 4, Retulerunt Julius. pp. 1.
that Pope Julius the 2. was scant so good a gra^marian as M. Nicols, for if
he were, he would not have assigned a warrant with fiatur, for fiat. Alphonsus
de (...) sets forth the Popes for excellent learned men, for thus of them he
writes, Constat plures papas adeo Illiteratos esse, vt gra^matica^ penitus
ignorent: it is manifest yt many Popes are so unlearned, that they are utterly
ignorant of their gra^mar.

If M. Nicols learning be feeble being (by your own saying) a seely
Grammarian, then many of your Popes had not much learning, being no Grammarians
at all. Therefore in affirming M. N. feebleness in learning, you have made me
prove some of your popes to be altogether without learning. you should have
foreseen, before you wrote, least by dispraising your foe, you danger your
friends, is not this a goodly gain you have got: it is as you do ever and as
you shall always, you think by your (...) to overthrow other: but with your
own trypps you ouertumble your selves.

Well, though it stand M. Nicols in hand to have learning being a minister of
gods word, yet it makes no matter whether one have learning or no that comes
to be Pope, for Baldus writes, Papa est doctor vtriusque iuris, authoritate
no^ Scientia: The Pope is doctor of both laws, by authority, not by
knowledge. You may see what a precious matter it is to be a pope, if any knew
that his son should be pope, he need never put him to schole. The Popes
breast has such a special prerogative, that it has more learning without
study, then all the men's breasts in the world have with study, as it seems
by one of the popes gloses which is this, Et si totus mundus, etc. Although all the world would judge in 9. quae. 3. neque ab Augu. did. 19. si. Romanorum in
glos.
any matter against the pope, yet it seems we ought to stand to the
Judgment of the Pope. For he seems to have all laws in the chest of his
bosom; Therefore whatsoever the Pope either aloweth or disaloweth, we are
bound likewise to allow or disalow the same. And whosoever is not obedient to
the laws of the Church of Rome, must be deemed an heretic: and it were as
great sin, as Church robbing, to reason of any the popes doings.

You that fear to run into the laps of heresy, must affirm yt the pope has
all laws whatsoever, in his breast, though he be (...) so unlearned a dolt, and
whatsoever he aloweth or disaloweth, you must allow or disalow ye same. They
have (...) hard hearts and fantastical wits that will not believe all this yt
is thus glosed of ye pope. And as it may be thought yt the pope has power
above al other to judge rightly of al earthly matters and causes, because he
has all laws fast closed in his (...), (which he had need to keep close and
well shut, for fear they (...) out) eue^ so he has a heavenly judgment,
which none other on ye earth has or can have but he, for thus it is written:
Papa Extra. de tra^s. (...). quanto in glossa.
(...) coeleste arbitriu^ etc. The pope is said to have an heavenly judgment,
therefore in such things ash wills, his will stands in stead of reason.
Neither may any man say unto him, O sir, why do you thus? like as a law may be
made by the only will of the pope: so may the same (...) be dispensed withal,
only by the will of the pope. If the pope have such a heavenly judgment, as
his doctors allow him, and as he takes upon him, he might do very much good,
especially in determining and judging of poor men's causes yt have wrong,
whereby without any expenses and travel they might quickly obtain their
right. Well, as king Solomon obtained great wisdom at gods hands, so God sent
him an occasion soon after for the trial thereof, which was by finding 3.
King. 3.
out of the true mother of a living child, that two harlots did strive for, for
being doubtful who was ye true mother, very wisely he made them believe, he
would cut or divide the child between them, wherewith she that was not the
mother thereof was well content, but the true mother prick with natural
affection of her child, willed rather that the other should have her hole
child alive, then she to have half of it being dead: which when the wise
Solomon perceived, he delivered to the right mother her own child. Even so as
the pope has a divine and a heavenly judgment, so you shall see what an
occasion was given him, to show and set forth his divine and heavenly
judgment, with to ye intent that the popes divine knowledge and heavenly
wisdom should not be (...), I have set forth a worthy example thereof, in my
said book, (which you so much mislike) called a perlwasion from papistrie, as
follows. Persuasion from papistry page 121.
There was a great contention between the^ of Ratispone in Germany, and the
Abbey of S. Denis in France about the body of S. Denis, which was so deep a
doubt to Ioha^. Calvin. de reliquiis.
discuss, that none but the pope was able to try the truth thereof. And so to
Rome they went, and the pope sat sadly in judgment about it, and examined
their allegations and matter thoroughly, and grew to a conclusion: and in the
end gave thereof his deep and diffinitiue sentence, and said that both they of
Ratispone, and they of S. Denis, had the whole body of S. Denis, and that
whosoever would say the contrary should be an heretik. If the truth had not bin
fast nailed to ye pops chair, (and also if he had not had a meruelus divine
and heavenly judgment) the pope could never have given such a true, wise, and
learned judgment of this weighty matter.

Now surely it was a popelie Resolution, yea and such a one as must needs
make the veriest fools in the world believe that Will Summers would not have
given so found and ridiculous a judgment. This famous, divine, and true
judgment of the Pope is sufficient (if there were nothing else) to make us
believe that the Pope can not lie. Here the Pope shows that he had a heavenly
power with his divine judgment, more like a God then a man. Though this before
written may perswad you Jesuits, that this pope had all laws and knowledge in
his breast: yet it assures us Christians that he had no wit in his brain,
and though it teach you that he was a divine judge: yet it does tell us
plainly, that he was a very doite. Wherefore though you count M. Nicols but a
seely Gammarian, yet if he had sit in place of the Pope, he would have given
a wiser Judgment than he: and though you count his learning but feeble, yet he
would not have given such a feeble judgment of the body of saint Denise as
your Pope did. Yet every one must believe, (that will not be an heretic) that
his judgment was true, in yt he said yt S. Denis had one body in germany, and
an other in France. All this before written well weyed and considered,
howesoeuer you Jesuits judge of master Nicols learning, we Christians must
think that some of your Popes had neither wisdom nor learning.

The 9. part.
YOu say we shame not to proclaim triumphs upon 9. (...).
so base conquestes against our mother the Catholic Disco. page 4.
Church, who has borne us and brought us up, etc.

We need not thanks be to God be ashamed of any triumphs that we
proclaim, and it is very hard for you to prove that we proclaim our
triumphs openly; but rather give therefore praises to GOD, and (...) there at
in wardly. And yet to say truth, we may (...) proclaim our triumphs, then you
may rejoice in yours, for we triumph not in burning our brethren, in privy
conspiracies, in sowing of sedition, in rebelling against our prince, and in
procuring her death, as you do, but our chief triumphing is, in the growing
of yt gospel, in recovering lost sheep, in winning yt wicked and in increasing
gods kingdom. Therefore to proclaim such triumphs (as we do not) were no such
shame as you say. And where it seems you mean the base conquest we triumph
in is the winning of master Nicols, the conquest is not so base as you would
make your Reader believe: unless you think it to be but a base conquest to
couquere the Diiuel, and to pluck a soul out of the claws of Satan.

As before you counted master Nicols to be but base (...), so now you blow
forth, that the winning of him is but a base conquest, but as you think that
our conquest therein is but small: so I believe the conquest of the popes
soldiers in Ireland (not long since) was not very great, and whatsouer cause
we have to triumph in this, I am sure he has no cause to triumph in that.
And yet if your Pope have (...) much power as his procters pronounce, and as
much might as you and many would make him, and if he has power Grego.

come out of heaven into Ireland to fight for him, and to vanquishe and kill the
(...) power there: as well as God sent his Angels, to destroy the host of
Sennacherib that came against King (...) to destroy Jerusalem.

I would feign know in what part of the Bible or the word of God, you have
read, that your Romish Church is a mother, or in what place of the Gospel you
can find, that your said Catholic mother of Rome has, or ought to have any
children in England: Truly your mother of Rome may think that she has
children in England, but they that be wise, in England will not think they
(...) any (...) mother in Rome. They that take God for their father, will not
take your Church of Rome for their mother: God the father of heaven is not able
to do more for his (...). then your earthly mother of Rome is able to do for
her daughters. Christ taught his Apostles to say, Our father which art in
heaven, and not our mother of Rome which art in earth, if your Church of Rome
be our mother, I (...) then who begat us on her, and who was our father, for I
hope you will not say that she is Hermaphroditus, both man and woman, and so
both our father and mother. Surely she is so contrary to God, yt he is none of
her husband, neither will he have any such wife, as regards not his sonue, or
conte^neth his gospel, as your mother of Rome does altogether. Therefore I know
no meet husband for her, unless it be the Devil, who in my judgment is the
fittest husband for her that can be found, for as she counts herself Lady
and Mistres of all the world, so the Devil is Prince and a mighty ruler in yt
world, whereby it does appear (if she have any husband at al, if she have
married with her match, as such a proud dame will (...) loath to marry under her
degree,) that the devil is her husband, and then he must needs be father to
all her children, and (...) by this means you yt take the holy Church of Rome
for your mother, must needs be enforced to have yt devil to your father: Or
else she must be unmarried and play yt Whore, and so the best you ca^ make of
it, you prove your selves bastards, and your mother a whore. And to the intent
you may perceive, yt your holy mother of Rome is more like a whore, the^ a
good woman, the whore of (...) whereof S. John in his revelation Apoc. 17
does write, by ye judgment of S. Hierome writing to Algasia, is ye purple
whore of Rome, who says, Nec vult, etc. Which is, neither will he openly say,
that the Roman Empire should be destroyed, which they yt govern it think it to
be everlasting, wherefore according to the revelation of S. John, in the
forehead of the purple whore there is writ ten a name of blasphemy, which is
Rome everlasting. And moreover the place where this purple whore should sit
must needs be Rome: for the angel does plainly tell Saint John, yt the vii.
heads of the beast whereon ye purple whore Apoc. 17.
sits, signifies vii. (...), and there is no City in all ye world yt is
builded upon vii. hills, but only Rome in Italy, whereby though you would
avoid yt your mother ye Church of Rome is not the wife of the Devil: yet by no
means it can be denied, but that your holy mother of Rome is a strumpet and a
very harlot according to the words of S. John, and so all her children must
needs be bastardes. And forasmuch as you counther your spiritual mother, you
must needs have a spiritual father, and because none can beget spiritual
children on a spiritual harlot, but the Devil, then whether you will or no,
though the Devil be not your Romish mothers husband, yet he must needs be
her paramoure, and father to all her children. Therefore as long as you take yt
Church of Rome for your mother, you must needs be ye bond bastards of ye Devil,
wherefore forsake yt harlot your mother, ye you may be the free children of God
your father.

If you knew what a wicked and cruel mother you have of her, you would not
long be her children, for if she may be counted a wicked and cruel mother
yt will allure her child to steal whereby he shall be hanged, or else does cut
his throat, if he do not steal as she wills him: then your holy mother of
Rome, is the most wicked and cruel mother of all other, for if you do rob God
of his glory and Christ of his merits (as she does teach you) then you shall be
(...) in the endless pains of hell: and if you deny to do it, she will burn,
murder, or kill you, because you do not as she wills you. Therefore ye great
extremity of them that are under such a mother, will enforce them if they be
wise, to fly from her, and humbly desire God to their father.

And where you say ye your holy mother of Rome has borne us, whether you mean
spiritual birth or temporal bearing us on her back, I am sure you say most
untruly. She may bear or bring forth Jesuits if she will, but she can never
bear or bring forth true Christians if she would, as you that are Jesuits
take her for your mother, and rejoice yt she has borne you: so we yt are
Christians take god for our father and are most glad yt we are borna new in
christ through hearing of ye gospel and working of ye holy ghost. And (...) for
other bearing I am sure ye pope which is ye head of (...) church has been so
long used to be borne on men's shoulders, that he will disdeyne to bear or
carry any, either on his shoulders or other wise. Therefore in this that your
holy mother has borne us (take it which way you will) is a most manifest
untruth: unless you have some other mystical meaning in it, that is to busy
for my brain.

And with our bringing up I think your holy mother has not been much
troubled, for thanks be to God our soil has and does daily yield us
sufficient sustinance and (...) of all things: yea and that has been such a
long time, since your holy mother has cursed us, for so long as she blessed us
we never fared so well, that the like has not been seen: (God grant we be
thankful for it,) unless you mean our bringing up in Queen (...) time by
your holy mother, which if all things be well marked, may be called rather a
beating down then a bringing up, no doubt your holy mother took then great
pains with bringing of us up, for they that obeyed her, they helped to feed her
and bring her up, and such as stuck to Gods word and refused her, she did
beat down and burned them to ashes, was not this a loving mother that thus
brought up her children:

If you mean of the bringing up of master Nicols by your holy mother at Rome,
in feeding and releeuing him, I must needs say, that though it was to feeding
of his body, it was to the killing of his soul. For your holy mother feeds
her children as cattle is fed, for though the ox is glad when he is put into
a good pasture to be fed: yet the simple ox is fed to be killed: So your
holy mother feeds her children to the death of their souls, and nourishes
them lovingly to their endless destruction. And as the ox is ignorant that
he is fed for his death, so you little know the destruction will follow
this your bodily feeding. Therefore if you would consider the end of your holy
mothers feeding of you, would rather fast and fare hard, in England under your
merciful prince: then to have all the pleasures you can wish, under your
cruel and wicked mother of Rome. Therefore (...) from that feeding that will
make you fast al ways, and shun from these delicates that will drive you to
the Devil.

The tenth part.
YOU write in your said book (to the great slander 10. part.
and reproach of our ministers and Preachers) that if Discovery page 5.
the notable infamous acts of ministers and Preachers only, in this one Realm
of England, for the space of one dozen years past, were gathered into some
one book, for the view of the world: they would be more in quantity, and in
quality more heinous, than all that they have gathered by great labor and
much fashood in their several books, out of the lives of the woorst
Catholics for these thousand years past, over all the whole world, etc. If
you had lamented the wicked liuinges and lascivious lives of the ministers and
Preachers of Gods word, as you rejoice therein, you would not have written so
manifest a falsehood as you have done. But as the Devil is the father of lies:
so can not his children be tellers of truth. And as you have detracted my
book, without any trial: so you have (...) our ministers and preachers
without any proof or any argument but this your own bare words, thinking
belike that you Iesuices should be of such credit, that your bare sayings
should be taken forsooth, and your counterfaite coin should go for current.
Whatsoever before I have written of you, I have done the same with authorities
and arguments: but this that you have written against our ministers and
preachers, we have but only your pen for a proof and your word for a
warrant. But as I must needs confess that many of our ministers and preachers
have not lived so well as they should, nor so godly as I wish: yet it is
most manifest for certain hundredth years past that many of your holy Popes,
Cardinals, Prelates, and Papisticall priests, have lived so horribly,
incontinently and diuelishly, that it will loath any true Christian to hear. I
doubt not but if you could have mamfested your malicious mind against our
preachers and ministers, you would not wish such slight words so soon have
given it over, but for that it would have been to busy for you openly to
prove such a number of notable infamous acts against our preachers and
ministers, as you pretend privily with your pen: You refer your readers in
the mangent of your book, to the records of our temporal courts. Indeed ye
Pope and his prelates are wilier the^ our spiritualty, for none of their doings
or deeds may be called to account, but only before themselves. No lay man may
accuse you, no temporal judge may co^de^ne you, nor no king may control you,
whereby your devilish practices may be kept privy, and yt the common people
should not know your detestable dealings. And because you would seem to be
saints though your livings were loathsome: you provided a remedy for a
mischief, but if ye practices of your Popes, the co^dicions of your cardinals,
ye blemishes of your Bishops, the Acts of your Abbots, the manners of your
monks, ye facts of your friars, ye chastity of your cha^no^s, and the
pernicious doings of your priests for a thousand years past might have come in
question before temporal magistrates and civil judges, and yt ye lay me^ might
have co^plaind so a against the^ according to their causes, as they may do
against our preachers and ministers with us: the^ I am most sure and certain yt
all the abominable acts, detestable deeds, execrable enormities and filthy
facts of them could not be contained in a great number of greater books, then
the greatest bybles we have. For seeing there is so many books filled with
their filthy factes, and detestable doings, for all their restrained laws and
privy keeping of the same: what a number of volumes would have (...) farced
therewith, if every one that would, might have written according to their
deserts, and complained to the temporal powers according as they had
occasion: Also it cannot be that our ministers and preachers of Gods word,
which is the director of truth, should generally live so infamously as your
preachers and professors of ye popes religion, which directs into darkness. If
they yt go in the bright day, walk wrong, then they that go in the dark night
are not like to go right. And if they go wrong that know the way, then they
that know not the way are not like to go right. They that know the way may go
right if they list: but they that know not the way cannot go right, If they
would. Thus our preachers and ministers have a great advantage of the blind
papists, for that they know the light of the gospel, who though they go
wrong, yet they may return into the way again: but you that profess the
dark doctrine of the Pope, you must needs go wrong do what you can. So that
through the knowledge of gods word, our preachers and ministers, will say they
go wrong, when they go not right: but you Jesuits and Papists, (for want of
Gods word) do say you go right when you go wrong. These countries that have
and do most constantly embrace Gods word, have ever had and have some
preachers and ministers, yt lived more wickedly tha^ godly, and more
reprochfully tha^ religiously: but their going wrong makes not their religion
evil, but their evil religion does cause them to go wrong. The naughty deed of
Baala^ did not make yt the religion of the prophets was false, the traitrous
dealing of Judas with Christ his master (being one of his Apostles) did not
approve yt his religion and the religion of all the rest of the Apostles was
evil: no, for Christ did teach him his religion, but the Devil did teach him
his treason. Even so if any of our Preachers or mynisters live more ungodly
then they should (as no doubt too many of them do:) yet their religion does
not teach them to do so, for Christ in his Gospel has taught them their
religion: but the Devil without the Gospel does teach them to live ungodly and
wickedlie. Now seeing that Jesus Christ had but twelve Apostles, and one of
them for money (...) the (...) contrary to his religion (though he were daily
in the company of Christ:) then it is no marvel, though amongst such a great
number of ministers and preachers as we have in England, there be many that
live ungodly and contrary to their religion, in the absence of Christ.
Therefore though you dispraise our preachers and ministers never so much, yet
that is no sufficient proof that their religion is evil or their doctrine
false, (though some of them were so evil as you do pretend.) We must
follow the good doctrine though the Preacher do evil, but we must not
follow a false Preacher though his needs do seem good. I must needs
confess, that the (...) life of the preacher and minister, would do very
much good in increasing Gods Church, and some (I fear) do as much harm with
their evil living as they do good with their true preaching (but that is to
the fond and (...) lish.) But surely I muse that any can be so foolish, to
refuse good preaching and to follow evil doing. The simplest man that is (that
has any wit,) knows that whoredom is sin, swearing is a vice, theft an
offense, and drunkenness is a wicked thing, with other such like: then they that
know that these are sins and vices, why should they commit them though
they see the preacher or minister use them: and also if they can despise the
minister and preacher for doing of the^: then why do they commit that
wherefore they despise the minister or preacher: Will they sin because the
preacher or minister does sin: If they like the preacher or minister A thing
worth the noting.
so well that they will sin with him for company: then they must be content to
go to hell with him for company. But if a stranger come to a (...) where he
was never before, and does ask the way to a place, if one should say to him my
friend, that is the way, but take heed, for a little before there is a deep
pit, into which if you should fall you will be in hazard of your life, yet
notwithstanding he that gives him this warning, goes before him and wilfully
falls into the same pit, do you think that this stranger would be so
mad, as to go and fall into the same pit with him for company: I think not,
he would rather shun a little aside to go safe. Now if a stranger will
shun an earthly pit, (where he may happily get out again,) because he sees
one fall into it before: how (...) are they then, (though they be never so
unlearned) that will commit the sins they know, because yt preacher or
minister does them, whereby they shall fall into the deep dungeon of hell,
where they shulbe in endless torments and can never get out if they (...) once
in. Therefore if the Preachers and ministers of Gods word live according to
their (...), then we may be bold to follow both their (...) and deeds: but
if they do contrary to their doctrine, then we must shun their deeds and
follow only their doctrine. And according as Christ says, we mustdoe as they
say and Mat. 23.
not as they do. Therefore deeds must not allow the doctrine, but doctrine the
deeds. Wherefore you do not well, to mislike our religion of the Gospel,
because some of our Preachers and ministers live not according to the Gospel,
but you dispraise our ministers doings, because you would have their doctrine
despised. Wherein ye deal very preposterously, for you would have an evil
living to (...) a good doctrine: But we will have a good doctrine reprove an
evil (...). But if a good doctrine condemn wickedness and sin, (as the
gospel does,) the^ that cannot be a good doctrine that mainteineth wickedness
and sin, which your Romish religion does, and therefore it is a false
doctrine. And if the evil living of our preachers and ministers does show
that our doctrine is false (as you would make it) then the most abominable
liuinges and detestable doings of your Popes and their Prelates, do show
that your doctrine is not very true. And now because you charge our ministers
and preachers with infamous living, to have their doctrine discredited, as
though your popes and their (...), had and have only power to live godly and
virtuously: I will here briefly put you in remembrance of some of their
spiritual and (...) vealinges set forth in my said book called A persuasion
from Papistrie, which part of my book, I think either you never read, or else
you have forgotten the same: for that you have bestowed the title of infamous
acts upon our ministers and preachers, which is your own by right, yea and
none caniustly claim it from you.

And seeing you will needs have your Church of Rome to be your mother, I will
now show you what a holy mother you had once that was head and Pope of your
said mother. And as I have proved that your said mother (if you will needs have
her your mother) is a very whore: so this holy mother, that I will speak of,
was a very harlot (if they that have (...) without husbands are harlots.) For
though Marie the mother of Christ did conceive by the holy Ghost: yet I hope
you will not say but that this your mother did conceive by some other.

they had a holy mother. If ever ante might call ye church of Rome, their

Pope Boniface the 7. caused Pope John's eyes to be put out, and after to be
thrown into prison, where he was (as some Page 72.

This holy Hildebrand hired one to lay great stones over the Emperors head in
the roof of the Church where he used Page 73.
to pray, and to let them fall upon him and so to kill him, but the fellow that
did so, fell down and was dashed all to pieces with the same. This was a famous
deed of a Pope, but you would have said (as you might well enough) that it
had been a notable infamous act of a Preacher or minister of the Gospel. Also
this holy Pope Hildebrand (...) three men to death before they were convict,

All you that would learn equity and justice learn here of the Pope, I

souls, but the destruction of them. Though some of our Ministers and Preachers
live not like Saints: yet this Pope in his sayings was something like Satan. I
think you cannot say (unless you say falsely) that any of our ministers or
preachers have spoken such infamous words as this. Pope Boniface did, and that
they would either kill men or make them flee from their faith.

how infamous soever our ministers and preachers acts be, it appears that the
deeds of the said Pope was not very good, nor his conditions very godly.

Pope Sextus granted to Petrus Ruerius a Cardinal Page 8.
and all his whole family free leave to use the sin of Sodomitrie (a thing
most shameful to be uttered, but most abominable to be licensed, or
permitted.) This was no infamous act because a pope did license it, and because
a Cardinal did commit it: though God does so detest it, that therefore he
consumed Sodom and Gomora and whole Countries with fire and brimstone from
heaven. A great sort more of such precious popes I could show, yt have very

But I assure you if our Preachers and ministers did deserve y^ same, the one

morefit to be mu^blers of the mass, then ministers of Gods word. Truly your
mother the holy Church of Rome, that has had such unholy fathers can not well
be counted to be a very holy mother, and that has had such devilish heads
cannot well have a very godly body. And now because your said mother must
needs be ungodly, you her children cannot be very virtuous. And also your
Cardinals have not lived very holily nor chastely, for at y^ council of
Trident, two of your holy Cardinals were taken and flaine (...), which may be
famous and godly with you Iesuices, but it is most infamous and wicked with us
that are Christians. You cannot charge either any of our Bishops, Doctors, or
preachers of Gods word, with any such infamous act at any of our Councels or
Parliame^ts, for if you could I doubt not but you would. And by the report of
S. Barnard, the Bishops did not live very vertuosly in his time, who says:
Quaein occulto (...) ab (...), turpe est vel (...): It is shame to utter the
things that are done of Bishops in their secrets. Barnardad Clerum in Synodo

lived so holy and chastely as you would seem, and therefore our Preachers and
Ministers may rightly return the same unto the^, for that they are better
acquainted with infamous acts and unchaste life the^ they. And because you shall
not say that I speak at randon without proof against your papistical
unmarried priests, as you do against our married preachers and ministers: I will
show you a little taste, y^ better to conjecture the rest. It is noted upon the
decrees thus: Communiter dicitur quod pro simplici fornicatione quis deponinon
debet, cum pauci sine illo vitio (...). It is commonly Did. 81. (...) (...) in
glos.
said, that a man may not be deposed or deprived for simple fornication,
forasmuch as few (priests) be found without that fault. Here the popes
decree does hold and allow that priests may use simple fornication, without any
harm or punishment: but I never read that either Christ or his Apostles
allowed so much, and besides yt it affirms that (...) all Priests were
fornicators, for it says few lived without that fault. And seeing y^ popes law
has decreed it, it must needs be true, for a popes law cannot be false, and
thus though you without warrant (but only your own word) do charge our preachers
and ministers with notable infamous acts: here have I brought you one of your
popes own decrees (in whose (...) or breast is al knowledge and law, yea and a
heavenly judgment, and who^ you are bound to believe upon pain of heresy)
that says plainly, few priests live chaste, but are fornicators. Therefore if
the popes decree be true (as I am most sure in this case it is truer the^ your
tale) your priests must be fain to take this title of infamous acts from our
preachers. And because it may y^ better appear, yt the popes have rather
excused their priests in living unchastly, the^ to restrain the^ from it, I
will put you in remembrance of a note or two touching the same, written in my
said book called A persuasion from papistrie, which I am sure you like so much
the worse because it opens something plainly the vile and infamous sayings
and doings of your holy Romish Church, And these are the words.

You may see by this pretty lesson that follows, whether (...) Pope by his
restraining of Priests marriage, does Persuas. from papistrie, Page 203.
mean that thereby they should live chaste or not, and this it is mark it
well: Si non cast tamen caute, If thou deal not chastely yet deal charily: The
rule is pretty and short, though the Pope knows that his Chaplyns cannot hide
their vicious living from GOD: yet he would have them hyde it from men. (A
man may look through the whole Bible, and yet find not such a fine rule for
whooredome:) and because it is not to be found in the Bible, but directly
against the doctrine of the Bible, therefore I may conclude, that it is (though
it came from the pope) the doctrine of the Devil. And that you may think that
this will rather allure them to lewdenesse then win them from wickedness,
mark this that follows, if we had none other law for thieves but these
words, If men live not truly, yet let them steal privily: do you think
that then woe should have as few thieves as we have? I think not: And as
this would increase the thieves, so does that fine rule of the Popes, breed
fornicators, (...), whoores and harlots. Therefore you may see by the Popes
lessons, that he means not to chide his Chaplyns for their (...), but rather
to (...) well of them that can do it most privily.

Mark here also what a straight law was made against women for lying with
Priests, In a provincial council holden at Oxeford, it is written thus, Let

Mark what Petrus Rauennas one of the popes (...) In glos. (...). de

upon the decretales says, notwithstanding handling and kissing in lay persons
be the occasions or beginnings of incontinent or unchaste behavior, yet in
priests it is far otherwise. Uerye well said and doctor like, for priests
do not kiss or dally with women, as other men do, for the priests kissing

of it thus, that he does it to the intent to bless her. Well said, for such
blessings of the priests have been so full of virtue, that many women thereby
have had such tympanies, that they could never be helped of their disease,
before they had mydwiues to be their physicians. Are not these goodly gloses

preachers and ministers would not commit so many infamous acts as you say
they do, but would live as virtuously as your popes, and as (...) as your

most convenient to bury the dead in the earth, mary I will not say but that
the Pope (being endued with all wisdom and heavenly judgment) may think it
more better to bury the dead in the water. And in deed it stands with good
reason, that if the water be a fit grave for the (...), then it is as meet a

sackes Sabelli. Enne. 9. lib. 2.

famous deed, I must not say an infamous act. Though you of your courtesy
charge our preachers and ministers with infamous acts, yet if you should search
all the pondes of our bishops, preachers, and ministers throughout England, I
am most sure you should not (...) in them all so many childrens heads as was
in that one ponde of your Popes. Except they were cast there before, by the

ministers with infamous living, without proouing of any: they charge diverse of
the Popes clargie and Priests with horrible and detestable dealinges, and

you perhaps will count the^ false, because they are written against you,

pernicious practices and the sincke of all sin: and your Popes, prelates, and
priests (whose livings have been most wicked and vicious) the (...) of all

for you to have holden your peace, and not to have entitled our preachers and

them. I will tell you my mind, such as are weary of their welfare in england,
I wish they should taste of evil fare at Rome: and such as are not pleased
to be governed by a most merciful prince at home, I would they were yokt
with a cruel tyrant abroad: and such as are not (...) with their own (...)
country of England, I would they might suffer some penury in a barran and
foreign soil: for though such may pleasure you, yet I am sure they do but
(...) us. But if there be such a great number of the^, it is a great toke^ they
love not their prince so well as the Pope, and therefore more meet to be with
the Pope, then with their prince. And because they prefer the popes laws
before the Queens proceedings: therefore I think them more (...) for Rome
then for England. You may say they are true to the Pope, but I am sure they
are false to their prince: or else they would be content to be governed by
(...) grace. But though many return from us to you, yet our prince does not
send them (...) to Rome to stir (...) there, and to seek the (...) of the
pope: as the pope has sent some hither (...) England of late to allure the
people to rebellion for the confusion of their (...). You make as though there
were a (...) great number of them returned from us to you, if all the important
learned personages had returned to be of your (...) that are still of ours:
then you might have boasted that they had been a great number in deed. Yet it
seems by your saying, as though you had almost all, and weefe we or none, or
that shortly (for that they refuse us so fast) that England will be destitute
of meet men for the ministry. You count our learned men that are daily won
from the Gospel to you; but you consider not the great number of the simple
and unlearned sort that our preachers win daily from you to us. If you
increase one way, I believe we increase twice as much an other way. And
whereas these important learned men you mean, before they revolted from us,
were able to instruct the simple and unlearned: shortly I (...) not but that
many of the simple learned that are (...) converted to us, will be able to
reprove your said important learned personages.

And this their great returning to your religion (you say) is upon the trial
of the truth. This is your own bare (...), for other arguments or proof to
confirm the same you bring none. But belike the trial of your truth hangs
(...) men's (...) to you, which if it be so, then why may not the daily
returning of other to us, try as well that ours is the truth (...) If you
mean the truth is tried by the number of them that return, then we have no
cause to refuse you therein: far whereas one does turn from the Gospel to
(...), twenty have and do daily both here and in other countries, come from
papistrie to the Gospel. But the turning or returning of the people is no
perfect way to try the truth. For Gods word (...) him that turns: but he
that turns must not try Gods word. None of the popes preachers did ever
turn so many in a day to (...), as Peter did turn to the Gospel, for Saint
Peter converted (...). (...).
in (...) day three thousand by preaching the Gospel. Therefore if the truth
of religion depend of the number of them that are turned, then I am sure the
religion of the Gospel is true, and all other religions are false. For none
other religion in all the world has so quickly, soddenly, and myraculously
encreast and sprung up as the gospel. And further if you will make the truth
of your religion to consist by the turning of us to you, why may we not then
as well say that the turks religion is also true, for that diverse Christians
have and do revolt to the same:

And as you say that many of our ministry is returned from John. 6.
us to you: even so I say that many of Christ's disciples went from him, and
walked no more with him: yet I hope you will not say that Christ's religion was
false because his disciples daparted from him, and forsook his religion. But
as Christ's disciples were false disciples, because they departed from Christ:
even so our men of the ministry (be they never so learned,) are false
ministers and Apostatas, because they are returned from us, which teach the
same Gospel that Christ taught to his disciples.

And whereas you boast that they that are returned from us to you, are
important learned personages, yet (if a christian may give a Jesuit counsel)
I would wish you not to lean too much to your or their learning, for great
learning without Christ is nothing: but small learning with Christ is much God
beholds the lowly, not the learned. The blessed virgin Marie the mother of
Christ said, that GOD Luke. 1.
looked on the lowliness (not of the learning) of his handemaide. The hawtie
and learned Pharisees were not chosen by Christ to be his Apostles, they had
such learning, that they thought scorn of Christ, as you with your learned
important personages think scorn of the Gospel. And as the proud learned
Pharisees said to the simple and plain Jews that believed Christ, in these
words: Are ye also John. 7.
brought into error? do any of the rulers or of the Pha, risees believe on
him but the common people which know not the law, are accursed? So you with
your important learned personages, may say to the common and simple people that
believe the gospel, will you be seduced from our holy mother the Church of Rome:
will you be brought into the error of these heretics of a new religion: do
you see any of us that are important learned personages believe on their new
found doctrine: none follow them but the common and unlearned people, which
understand not the scriptures. Take heed therefore what you do, for our most
holy father the Pope has not only cursed them: but also we holy Jesuits
that hold on the blessed name of Jesus, have with a great oath accursed them,
and denounced them for heretics. Even thus you are in all points like to the
proud learned Pharisees, that were the enemies of Christ, for that you boaste
of your important learned personages, dispising our simple and small learning
as they did. And as the common people of the Jews that believed in Christ
(whom the Rulers and Pharisees accounted accursed) was in the true way, though
they said they were in error: Even so our Simple learned ministers, and the
common people that profess the Gospel, are in the true way, though you count
them in error, and you in error though you brag of the truth.

A great sort of our ministers and of the clergy (though they be not so
learned in the Latin and other tongues as some of you Jesuits are, and other
of your important learned personages revolted from us, though we have thanks
be to GOD a great sort, besides no small number of young Jmpes that are able
to match you every way) have better knowledge and sounder judgment in the
scriptures then you have. Yea and they are sorry at the very heart, to see you
so wilful ignorant in the truth: whom GOD accepts a great deal better
then you with all the learning you have you were better to have less learning
with truth, then more learning with falsehood. Saint Augustine says, Aug.
contra. Academi. li. 3 cap. 7.
Multo minus malum est indoctum esse, quam indocilem: It is a great deal less
harm to be unlearned, then to be wilful or unapt to learn.

Saint Ambrose says: Non in dialectica complacuit deo, (...) facere populum
suum. Regnum enim dei in simplicitate Ambr. de (...) lib. 1. cap. 3.
fidei est, non in contentione Sermonis: It pleased nor God by logique to save
his people, for the kingdom of God stands not in contention of talk, but in
simplicity of faith. Irenaeus writes, Melius est, and vtilius, Idiot as and
paru^ scientos Irc^. li. 2. ca. 45.
existers, and per charitatem proximos deo fieri, quam put are semultum scire,
etc. It is better a great deal for men to be ignorant and to know but little,
and by love to draw near to God, then to think themselves to know much, and
to have great experience, and yet to be found blasphemers against God. Saint
Ambrose also says, Verba philosophorum excludet simplex veritas piscatorum:
The simple plain truth of Fyshers, confounds the words of the learned
Philosophers. Here you may see the learned and ancient Doctors do prefer
the simple faith and plain truth of Jdyots, and poor fyshers, before wilful
deep contentious disputers, and learned Philosophers. Therefore you have no
such cause to brag or boast, neither of the great number of our Ministers,
neither of your important and learned personages, that are returned to you: But
you and they have great cause to be sorry, that you have forsaken your
obediencie of your most loving lawful and merciful Queen: and sworn
obediencie to that Antichrist of Rome, through continuing in whose diuelishe
doctrine until your last gasp, you will be brought into perpetual
destruction both of body and soul in hell (...) for ever. (Except you
repent). Therefore be not wilfully blind, but open your eyes willingly, and
resist the manifest truth no longer.

The 12. part.
YOu follow your old song still, for as you said before 12. part.
that M. Nicols is but base wares, here you say that he Disco. page (...).
in good sooth is not worth the taking up being found in the street etc.
Sometimes a lewd lie does lurk under a good sooth, you that do swear to

though you say in good sooth. You look that this smoth (...) of yours should
procure your reader to credit you, (...) as the Fox when he lies still as
dead, does hope of a pray: so you by this your smothe sothing hope to win
the simple reader the rather to believe you. Master Nicols may be glad that you
limited the place, or else you would not have allowed him to be taken up at
all. Well, it was happy that he was not found in the Street: else (by your
doom) he was not worth the taking up, and so he should have lien in the
street and perished. For who will take up that thing that is not worth the
taking up: It seems that some places are luckier then other, and some more
unfortunate then other. The Pope has his best luck in his chair, for there
he can not lie say what he will: And Master Nicols has his chief
misfortune in the street, for any where but there he is worth the taking
up. One may now easily guess, that you would not have taken him up, if you
had found him in the street. May would not some of you Jesuits have beaten
him down if you had found him in Rome out of the streets? fair (...)
friend at need, Christ thought him worth the taking up (as it does
appear) for even he him self (and I take him to be as good as your Pope and
the best Jesuit of you all) did not think scorn to take him up, and carried
him on his own shoulders, as one of his lost and strayed sheep. Therefore
Luke 15.
what so ever you say, Master Nicols was worth the taking up, or else Christ
the Son of GOD would not have taken such pains to have carried him on his
own back. You may see here what a great (...) there is between the Pope and
Christ, for the Pope would think scorn to carry one on his shoulders,
(especially M. Nicols) as Christ has done. Yet the pope should be the
inferior of the two, Christ the son of God (...) carry one hole man on his
shoulders: but the Pope will carry none, but must be carried on yt shoulders of
four men at ye least. Therefore ye pope may have a sheep, (I perceive) lie a
good while in a ditch ere he will take him up, nay they that be yt Popes Gotes
must be miuen to bear him on their backs. O how happy are those sheep yt
Christ bears on his shoulders: but how (...) are those gotes that bear the
Pope on their backs.

most spightfull and venomous word, you mean that our religion the Gospel of
Christ is wicked, else you would not have said perverted. Though you have
derided me for using a P. Whereof I will (God willing) speak in place
convenient: yet it lamenteth me that you misuse a P. here in this place as you
do. At the last day when all knees shall (...) before the Majesty of Jesus
Christ, you shall then (...), whether this (...) religion according to the
gospel is such, that they that are won unto it are perverted or not. I fear
you did speak against your conscience when you wrote that word. If they be
perverted that are won from (...) to truth, from darkness to light, from

You make a great brag because not one priest of late years is allured to our

and our religion false because no priests do receive it. Truth depends not
upon priests, but good priests depend upon truth. Truth will be truth, and

religion of Christ's Gospel is well able to stand without any of your priests.
Though your masses cannot be said without popish priests: yet our holy
Communion instituted by Christ may be celebrated well (...) without them.
Therefore you are wide to (...) that (...) religion cannot be without your

(which was the best conuerter of all other) did not convert one priest of
Moses law (yt law of God) unto him: then it were no great mexuell though our
preachers (that are but the servants of Christ) cannot convert one of your
priests of the popes law, which are enemies to the law of God. And though you

The fifteenth part.
YOu say you have nothing to compel our Ministers 15. part.
unto your part (which have offered themselves to you (...). Page, 7.
in this time) except evidence of truth, nor anything to allure them except
(...) and honesty. Brag is a good dog, if truth may be got with talking, I
doubt not but you will have it: but as (...) (...) the only truth, so they that
will have it must learn it of Christ. But because you are (...) by the holy
(...) of God, to maintain the Popes (...) yt are false which is olene
contrary to ye gospel of god with is truth, therefore you have not ye truth. The
Jews bragd yt they had Abraham to their father but Christ told them flatly
John. 8.
that they had the Devil to their father, who was a liar from the beginning,
and therefore they were liars because they were his children. Now if the (...)
which were the elect people of God, were liars and were the children of the
devil for all they said they had Abraham to their father: then you that are
not the peculiar people of God, may miss of ye truth and be very liars,
though you say your selves you have the evidence of truth. The Scriptures are
chief tryars of ye truth and Christ says: Ego sum via, veritas, and vita, I
am the way the truth and the life, and he also says, John. 14.
Search the scripture for they bear witness of me. Now John. 5.
(...) it is (...) by Christ's own words, that the scriptures be are witness
of Christ, which is truth. Now seeing you cleave to the Popes law, which is
contrary to Gods Jaws you forsake the scriptures, and therefore you have not
the truth, because you search not for it in the Scriptures. Theophilactus
says, That Gods word is the candle where by the thief is spied. Now as
thieves will put out the candle and go in the dark, for fear they should
be be wrayed by the candle light: so does your holy father the Pope and his
Chapleines, hide or put out Gods word least it bewray them. Therefore by your
hiding and suppressing Gods word you show your selves spiritual thieves.
Wherefore if thieves be true, then you have the truth. So that it appears
(yea and it is most plain) yt it is not the evidence of truth that makes our
ministers come so thick unto you, well it may be flattery and falsehood. And
can you make us believe, that all they do come to you from us for the truth
(...) know in your religion: No no, they regard the popes riches more then his
religion, the treasure of his coffers more then the truth of his cause, and his
liuinges more then his learning. Therefore you may put out truth well enough,
for truth is as hard to come by at Rome at your popes hand: as to have Oaks
growing in the Sea.

And as for your poverty, that cannot allure them, for it is not like the
Popes servants should be poor, (I pray God they may be poor in spirit) the
Pope that has the angels of heaven at his commandment, he may have gold and
silver enough at his beck. And he that may have money as much as he list,
then he were very unkind to suffer them to lack that do proppe him up in his
Popedom. (...) that Abb. (...). de elect. cap. licet abb.
can do whatsoever God can do: then he may do what soever Christ could
do, therefore as Christ made Peter (...) fetch twenty pence out of a fishes
mawe: So the Pope Math. 17.
may cause thousands of pounds to be fetched out of great whales bellies, and
never hurt any body for it.

I think our ministers that are thus revolted to you, do not love poverty so
well, that therefore they would forsake their country, fly from their
friends, and procure their princes displeasure, only to have your company for
poverty sake. Therefore herein you thrcape kindness on them whether they will
or no, for I dare say thus much in their behalf, that they had rather go to
Rome for the popes purse, then for your poverty. And if they go to Rome so
thick and three fold for your honesty (as you would feign persuade us) then
in my judgment they make but a sorry journey: I hope that honesty is not so
scarce in England, that for it they had need to go to Rome. I believe I
could help them to more honesty for a penny here, then they can have for a
pound there. (Yea and that which you call honesty, I fear will prove
hypocrisy, disobediencie, or rather plain traitrie,) which may go well
enough for dishonestie. Wherefore it were more wisdom to have without travel
and cost honesty at home, then with painful iournies and great expenses to
buie dishonestie or rather treason at Rome. There are a great sort of good
wits, wise heads, honest men and good Subjects in England, and all they I
am sure do think that you that flee to the Pope and forsake your Prince, obey
the Pope, disobey your Prince, observe the Popes laws, break Gods and the
Queens laws, refuse your own Country, think better of a strange Country,
discommend your Queens proceedinges, commend the Popes pernicious practices,
and disprayse England and extol Rome, are not greatly ouerladen with
honesty. You do well to have a good opinion in your selves, and for want of
other, to set forth your own honesties. But Saint Paul says, He that
prayseth himself is not allowed, but he whom the Lord prayseth. 2. Corinthians.
10. You are feign to report it your selves, least otherwise it should be hid
and unknown. You do as the unshame fast guest did, that thought himself
honester then any of the guestes beside, who looking a great while to be
willed to be set at the upper end of the Table, and saw that none would
bid him: he without any more ado, (as one more shameless then shamefaste)
set himself down and so took his place (without an Usher) at the higher end
of the Table. Which when the good man of the house saw, (perceiving him to be
more bold then honest) made the lower end to be the upper end, and so
accordingly he set and placed his guestes as he thought good: whereby this
man that would feign have been exalted, and that did set and place himself
highest, without any remoouing was enforced to sit lowest. So you, seeing none
either will or can well praise your honesties: (for there is no great cause,
for that you have changed your selves from being the Queens Subjects to be
ye Popes slaves, and from being faithful Christians, to be forsworn
Jesuits) have dishonested your selves, as the unshamefast guest did, by
publishing your own honesties. All your Country men that are honest in deed,
would have thought you a great deal honester than you are, if you had obeyed
your Prince, observed her laws, and continued in your own Country. Yea and
would have had a better opinion that you would be honest, if you would fly
from the Pope, embrace Gods word, return to your Country, and humbly
submit your selves to our most merciful Prince and Queen of England. This
is the way rather to recover your honesties lost, then to get any credit by
blasing your honesties abroad in your own books. Your late traiterous
attempts, your privy conspiracies, your (...) practices, your seeking and
wishing the death of your Prince, the destruction of her Council, and the
confusion of your Country too manifestly known and through Gods goodness
revealed: whereby some of your holy Priests had new tippets given them at
Tyborne, fit for their profession, is a manifest proof that you are very full
of honesty, and though you would feign be honest: yet your own writing does
witness your dishonestie, for though in less then a line you have set forth
your own honesties: yet your whole book has bewrayed your dishonestie.

part, as also to see how little cause this little man (which is master
Nicols) had to trouble us with bragging, it shall not be amiss to set down
in few words some short progress of his life etc. Namely his course from
Wales to England, and from England to Flaunders, from Flaunders to Rome, and
from Rome to the pulpit in the Tower of London, etc. As it was not amiss for
you in the first part of your disceuerie to set down a short progress of M.
Nicols life, for the better understanding of the first part of the same: Even
so I thought it not amiss in the first beginning of this my book for the
better understanding of your good disposition and honesty, herein to show
forth plainly and truly, your abominable profession, and your most execrable
oath for the perfourmance thereof. And though in derision you call him this
little man, and make as though he has troubled you with bragging: as little
as he is, He, whose servant he is, is able to give him strength enough to
overthrow your mighty Giants. It was not little David that boasted of his
manhood, but it was great Golyah that bragd of his strength. And as little
David seemed but a dwarf to Goliath the enemy of God: so does M. Nicols seem
(by your saying) a very little and selie wretch, and far unable to match with
the power of your mighty Gyaunt the Pope. But as little David not by his own
strength, but by the power of God, 1. Sam. 17.
did hit the great Golyah in the mids of his forehead with a stone of his
sling and so killed hun outright: So little M. Nicols, not of himself, but by
the help of God, with the little (...) of his tongue and pen, may with the
stone of Gods word, hit your mighty Pope such a blow, that it will make him to
stagger. Of the like (Gods name be blessed) we have great trial and (...).
For many as little and small to see to as M. Nicols, have so hit the Pope by
mean of their slings, that he has had such a fall: as I am sure he will
never recover again. You count it a great discredit for M. Nicols to travel
as he did especially from Rome to the Pulpit in the Tower of London, well me
thinks it deserves more credit to go from Rome to the Tower to preach the
word of God: then to be led from the Tower to (...) to be hanged for
treason. And therefore though you speak it in reproach of M. Nicols, that he
came from Rome to preach in the pulpit in the Tower: yet it was not greatly to
the praise of Doctor Story and Ducket called (...), and your great captain
Campion and other to he led from the Tower to preach in the pulpit at Tyborne.
(...) M. Nicols (...) from Rome into England, and to become a professor of the
Gospel, subject to his prince, and to be a friend to his country, is to be
discommended: then they yt go from England to Rome, to deny ye word of God,
to be false to their prince, and to be enemies to their country, are not
much to be praised. Thus if you weie all things uprightly, you have no great
cause to show Master Nicols progress from Rome to the pulpit in the Tower of
London, to his reproach. And now as you have discourst and opened M. Nicols
doings, to the discrediting of his religion: so have I discourst and blased
forth your execrable oath and religion, to the discrediting of your doyngs.

AFter this you say (and that again in good sooth) that The 17. part.

only repentance to pardon, and not his infamle to desperation. A false
meaning had need to be finely smothed, if you pity him because he embraces
the word of God, and is become obedient to his lawful and merciful prince,
then I must needs say you are too full of pity. I fear you are so full of
(...) pity, that there is small room for true pity that the scripture
allows. True pity can not be in them that so enuieth any, that will allow,
consent, yea and rejoice in the burning and destruction of any. Though you
pity M. Nicols as you say, yet he knows no occasion I am sure why you
should pity him so much. I would he had no cause to pity you. Nay you pity
him not but spite him that he does so well: but he and we all do pity you
that you do so evil.

It is but a mad repentance to pardon that you wish him, for you would have
him repent and (...) for ye that he has forsaken the Pope, and returned to
Christ, and that he dispiseth your Diuelishe doctrine, and embraces the
word of God. And you would have him trust to the Popes pardon which will
utterly deceive him, and to (...) Gods pardon, which only can help him. And
here upon you conclude, if he repent not to pardon as you (...) him, then he
must needs be infamous, and so come to desperation. But we may well doubt
whether your bare word, without either authority or any argument, be a
sufficient warrant, that he if he continue in the gospel, and the obedience
of his prince, shall be infamous, and so come to desperation. But though you
would have your simple reader to give credit only to your good sooth, that M.
Nicols if he continue in the gospel as he does, shall there by get infamy and
so come to (...) whereof you are uncertain, because you have not yet seen the
proof (for he is yet alive): yet I would have the indifferent reader consider,
that I have already with arguments, proofs, and true examples plainly (...),
that diverse of your religion wrought their own infamy and came to
desperation, whereof I have seen the trial. Therefore your good sooth is not
a sufficient proof, that M. Nicols if he continue as he does, shall come to
infamy and (...). But the doleful and desperate deaths of them of your
sect, which are yet fresh in memory, is a manifest proof: that you and your
sectaries will come to infamy and desperation, if they and you continue as you
and they do. Therefore we much pity you, and wish only your true and
unfeigned repentance, and that you may (...) pardon for your sins at Gods
hand, through the death of his son Jesus Christ, the only Savior and
redeemer of all the world, and not to stick to the popes pardon.

The 18. part.
IT seems that you have a divine knowledge in presaging The 18 part.
or foreshewing the cause why one is borne in the place, where they first come
into the world, (it may be that you learned it of the pope who has a divine

(soon after you something touched M. Nicols short progress and course from
Wales to Rome, and from Rome to the pulpit in ye tower of london) you say, I.
Nicols therefore was born Disco. page 19.
at Cowbridge in Wales, etc. By this your saying it does appear that M. Nicols
was borne at Cowbridge in (...), because he went or made his course from Wales
to England, from England to Flaunders, from Flaunders to Rome, and from Rome to
the pulpit in the Tower of London. For you, say, John Nicols therefore was
(...) at (...) in Wales, and now for that there is none other cause before,
specified, but only his said course and travel from Wales to England, and
then to Rome, and so from Rome to the pulpit in the Tower of London, therefore
his said journey and course, from Wales to England, and from England to
Flaunders, and from Flaunders to Rome, and from Rome to the pulpit in the tower
of London (if we may believe you) was the cause why M. Nicols was borne at
Cowbridge in Wales. It was happy that he traueyled that journey to Rome, and
so from Rome to the pulpit in the Tower of London, or else it seems by your
saying he had never (...) borne at Cowbridge in Wales. Had not you told me
this tale, I should have thought, that his being borne at Cowbridge in Wales,
was rather an occasion that he made this course and journey, then that this
his course and journey should have made him be borne at Cowbridge in Wales. As
the popes pardons have impossible virtues, so the popes Jesuits, can make
impossible causes, you counted before that M. Nicols was very base ware: but if
this be true yt you tell us, he can not be very base, neither yet such a little
man as you made him. For it is more like that he should be rather a heavenly
creature than an earthly little man: that took such a course and went such a
journey before he was borne. Your pleasant ieasting with one of my words, and
finding of fault therewith, (which is usually spoken, and which was apt for the
matter, and agreed with my sense, as shall appear (...)) has made me the
rather justly to (...) this (Therefore) of yours, which not only is needles,
but also marreth the meaning of the text, and has given it as before appears
a contrary sense. I marvel that you that are so skillful in co^troling of M.
Nicols in two or three lives of (...), are so far over seen in one english word.

The 19. part.
YOu are a good Proctor for the Pope, for where as you The 19 part.
go about to magnify his majesty, you publish his pride. Discou. page 16 17.
You can not conceute home the Pope should give M. Nicols thanks for his
(...) (which you call his stuff) for you say, in the consistory, the popes
place is so far distant from them which (...) thither to make (...), as he
can not speak unto him. (Be like the Pope then sits so, that the wind
blows from the preacher to the pope, which takes away the sound of the
Popes thanks from the preacher: else I see no cause (...) the preacher may
hear the Popes thanks, as well as the Pope may hear the preachers Sermon.
But it may be, that the Popes are always horste, or ye preachers deaf) nor
the pope does use (you say) to thank any man that speaks before him, what
soever he be, etc. Great learned men, and (...) orators have departed thence
without particular thanks, albeit they did their matters with great
commendations. Such (you say) is the gravity and state of that place.

You may see here, it is not the pride of the Pope, but the state of his place,
that causes them that make orations or preach before him to go away without
thanks. It seems there is a great difference between the Popes chair and
his consistory, for the popes chair is so full of wisdom and truth, that
the pope when he sits there, is full of learned talk, yea and can speak
nothing but truth, as it may appear by his judgment of the body of S. Denis:
but the popes consistory is such a proud and stately place, that the pope as
long as he sits there, dare speak never a word, or else is so doltishe a
place, that he, whiles he is in it, is tongutied, or has no wit to speak.

Well, seeing the pope is so dainty of his thanks to his preachers, it
should seem that he is very dainty in bidding them to dinner. But for that
the pope is called Seruus seruorum dei the servant of Gods servants, and he
taking his preachers for Gods servants, whereby they must needs then be his
masters: I muse that he is so far over seen, that he does not bid his
masters to dinner, especially seeing they preach before him. But I must say
that the pope is a stately servant (if he be a servant) that will neither bid
his masters to dinner, nor give them once thanks for their Sermons. The pope
belike would use his servants but homely: that deals with his masters thus
discourteously.

I perceive it is not the custom of your holy and lowely Church of Rome, that
a poor preacher shall dine with a proud pope, seeing a proud pope may not
give a poor preacher thanks. But one would think, though the popes table is
too hie for his preachers to sit at: yet the ground under the popes table is
low enough for them to lie on, where he may suffer the^ to pick up yt cromes
that fall from his table. And the^ his preachers might say, yt the pope does
as much for the^ for their preaching, as he did to his dogs for their barking.
But parhappes the ground under the popes table is not allowed for poor
preachers, but only for dogs and Dukes ever since duke Dandalus lay there.
It may be that the great virtue of the Popes chair would quite be lost, if
the pope should thank them that make Orations, or preach before him. Because
the pope would not be like unto Christ, therefore he is loath to be humble and
meek.

favor of her grace, (if you should chance to be caught as some of your
fellows have been.) It appears by your saying that ministry here is
sufficient to excuse dishonestie, for thus you say, If he (that is Disco. page
18
M. Nicols) should have dealt so in some other countries, where ministry is
not sufficient to excuse dishonestie, it would rather have fallen out to his
cost then his credit, etc.

As though ministers were so borne with all here, that they may work what
mischief they will without controlement: which is a most shameful slander.
What so ever ministers are here, too many such as you, are winked at or excused
here. But though ministry is not sufficient to excuse dishonestie in
England, yet priesthood is sufficient to excuse whoredom in Rome: And in
other places where the pope has power, as appears plainly before. And do
you think that the old proverb has lost his force at Rome, which is Omnia
venalia Romae, all things are salable at Rome: it can not be so, for what is
it that money will not excuse at Rome:

This following shows what swindge money has borne Aureum speculu^ in Antil.
at Rome, venalitate curiae Romanae inaniter praeficiuntur, Lenones, coqui,
stabularii equorum, and pueri: Through the briberie of the court of Rome,
baudes, cooks, hostlers, and boys be placed in offices to govern the Church.

Your mother the Church of Rome must needs be holy, that had such learned and
virtuous children. It is happy that now you have so many important learned
personages, for hereby it appears that your church was not wont to be
pestarde with learned prelates, unless baudes, cooks, hostlers, and boys were
counted to be such. And also your holy fathers ye popes would not stick to
pardon any thing for pe^ce, for they have given commonly prelates and priests
leave for money to keep harlots (for manners sake we must call them
concubines): yea and other offenses they have pardoned for money. Pope Martin
the fifte for money licenced one to marry his own sister. God nor his son
Christ, did never so much. Friar Ticel had such a large pardon of the pope,
that he said Ioha Sleidan. (...). 13.
if one had got the mother of Christ with child, he was able to pardon it. I
am sure you can not prove that our ministers have had any such licenses from
our Prince, as many of the Popes Prelates and Priests have had of the pope to
committee sins and offenses.

The Pope has given dipensations for sins before they be done: and he has
given pardons for them after they be done, as it is manifest. And though the
Popes pardons (which are delicate sawces to procure sin) are not warranted
by Gods word, but are quight contrary to the same: yet you swear as before
is (...) that the use of them is very wholesome for Christian people. And
though you allege without proof, that our ministry does excuse
dishonestie: yet it appears plainly by your oath, that your Society do
swear to maynteyne blasphemy, Idolatry, disobediencie, and traytrie until
your last gasp. Now whether ministerye in England, or your spirituality of
Rome do excuse dishonestie more, let the indifferente reader be judge. The
more you strive to withstand truth or to slander the ministers of the
Gospel: the more you set forth your folly and utter your shame.

YOu say only such go to purgatory, as die in the favor 21. part.

their sins, as Gods Justice requires, and therefore they are to be purged
by fire, etc. If Christ or his Apostles had told you, that such go to
purgatory, it might have won some credit to your cause, but your own bare
words (though you are a Jesuit) deserve no such credit, wherefore until
we find your purgatory in the Gospel of Christ, we will not believe you.
Therefore you waste but your wind to tell us of any thing, that is not there
to be found.

O what an horrible doctrine is this to think any man (the holiest that ever
was, except Christ) can do such penance for sins as gods justice requires:
you and they that think so are enemies to the cross of Christ. Can any thing
(...) in heaven or earth satisfy Gods justice for our sins, or else purge our
sins but only the blood of Christ? no no, if an Angel of heaven should say
so, I would not believe him, or if the most ancient or learned Doctor that
ever was should write so, I would utterly abhor his opinion therein. S.
John says, the blood of Jesus Christ the son of 1. John. 1.
God purges us and makes us clean from al our sins. And S. Paul says,
Christ has wrought the purgation of Hebr. 1.
our sins. Saint Cyprian says, Sanguis tuus domine non Cypri. de pas. Christ.
quaerit vltione^, Sanguis tuus lauat crimina, peccata condonat: Thy blood O
Lord seeks no revenge, thy blood washes our sins, and pardons our
trespasses. S. August. says, Aug. in psa. 25
Valeat mihi ad perfectionem liberationis, tantum pretium Sanguinis domini mei:
Let only the price of the blood of my Lord avail me to the perfection of my
delivery. Now if Christ does purge us and make us clean from all our sins,
then there is none left for the fire of purgatory to cleanse; If Christ has
wrought the purgation of our sins, then I am sure your (...) of purgatory,
(if there were any) can not purge them better: If according to Saint Cyprian
the blood of Christ washes away our sins, then what need have we of
either your popes purgatory or pardon: And if S. August desired that only the
price of christ's blood might avail him to the perfection of his delivery:
then why do you bring S. Augustine in as an vpholder of your purgatory? If
our sins might have been purged by fire, (as by your words you seem to
dream) then Christ would not so painefully have purged us with his blood.

You write a long circumstaunce of the saying of Saint Augustine, beginning
thus: Neither is it to be denayde Discou. pa. 29
that the souls of the dead are relieved by the piety of Enchiridion. cap.
110.
their living friends, etc. In all the same he does not once name
purgatory, much less prove it. But what if therein Saint Augustine had made
mention of purgatory? should we therefore believe there is a purgatory,
because Saint Augustine wrote it? Nay, if Saint Augustine (or any other) write
any thing of his own fancy or (...), not commanded nor commended by
Christ (as in the same he does) I will not believe him. And at this point I
would wish that all men were, to take all doctors and learned men's writings
for no better then fables (in things touching our salvation) if the same do
not agree with the word of God. But though you would make your simple Reader
believe yt S. Augustine does allow your Purgatory (as he does not) yet your
Reader were very simple if he would credit S. Augustine, if he be contrary
to Christ, or affirm his own (...) cie not allowed by Christ.

The 22. part.
AND thus you say further, that you teach (as it may 22. part.
appear in the council of Florence in literis vnionis) Discovery. Page 28.
that there are three sorts of men which dye, one very good, which go straight
to heaven, one very evil which go straight to hell, one mean betwixt both
which go to purgatory, etc. This your teaching may agree with the Council of
Florence, but I am sure it agrees not with the council of the Apostles,
therefore believe you the council of Florence, and we will believe Acts. 15.
the council of the Apostles at Jerusalem. And whereas you bring in Saint
Augustine for the proving of your Puagatorie, I think I shall bring in S.
Augustine, to say that he knows no such Purgatory, for here (...) affirm
three places, heaven, hell and purgatory, but (...) the third place is one mo

and these are his words touching the same, Primum (...) (...) Catholicorum,

that it is (...) to be found in the Scriptures: therefore it seems that he
would not allow any thing but that is to be found in the Scriptures. Wherefore
you may bring what text you will of Saint Augustine for your purgatory, but
he (...) (...) he knows no such place: and it were requisite that he
should know of the place, before he can prove it. I think it had been a
great deal better for the Pope to have claimed authority over Paradise that
is mentioned in diverse places of the Scripture, rather then purgatory that
(...) speaks of never a whit: and it had been as easy to put souls into
Paradise, as to pull souls out of purgatory, and thereby he might have got
money enough. But perhaps the Pope did doubt that the Angel that keeps
Paradise would not suffer these souls to come into Paradise, but rather keep
them out: and I doubt also that the Devils that keep your perilous purgatory
will not suffer these souls to come out of it if they be once in.

You say they that are very evil go straight to hell. I am sure you cannot
choose but count them very evil yt (...) did good deed in all their life, and
such a one was the thief that hanged (...) the right hand of Christ, for he
was but then newely (...) so that he had no time to do any good, therefore

must be so hold here either to reprove you or Christ. But because Christ
the son of God, is to be believed before a Jesuit the servant of the pope:
therefore your fantastical saying herein must needs go for a fable. And if
the said (...) (...) not very evil, and thereby not of the number that went

sort that you mean, for he did no such (...) as you speak of for his sins
as Gods justice required and therefore by your doctrine he went to purgatory,
there to be purged by fire and so saved. But because Christ (which is to (...)

Paradise, therefore, he went neither to hell nor to purgatory, but straight
to Paradise. Thus you may see an unlearned (...), has confounded a learned

the pope and kneeling to him: because you want Scripture you prove it by

occasion to kneel to Christ for saving her life: then the people have to
kneel to the Pope to receive his blessing.

And though the Pope cannot claim his (...) nor to go in his pontificalibus by

when no other way will serve, you will approve it lawefull with your own

these are your words concerning the same.

At certain high festival days he (that is the pope) Discovery. Page 55.
is borne from his palace into Saint Peter's Church (for at none other time or
place is that thing used) it is a matter so reasonable (the circumstances
considered) as can be offensive to no indifferent wise man, etc. The matter
stands thus, at certain principal feasts of the Church, the Pope uses to
leave his private chapel, and to come down to service in Saint Peter's
Church, at which time such great multitudes of people expect him there, to
receive his benediction, and very many also to see him which never saw him
before, being strangers and come from far Countries to visit those holy
places: as it is impolsible for him to pass in and out through the preasse,
and to be seen to give his benediction to al, except he should either ride or
be borne in his chair. And to ride it were very unseemly and inconvenient
having to pass through all Saint Peter's great Church, where the most preasse
is and also for the passages of stones and stayres. Wherefore they have used
always, to lift him up in his chair, and so to convey him through the
multitude, and this is all the matter, which is so much exclamed at, etc. Which
(you say) notes rather malice in them that malign it, then conuinceth pride
in the pope that admits it, or any fault at all in the well meaning
Christians, who upon so just causes do both desire and offer it. For that
Christ is the best pattern to follow of all other, and did never use such
pomp to be borne on men's shoulders, neither in the temple of Jerusalem nor in
any other place, and because the Pope is by his own saying but Christ's Utcar
or Deputy: me thinks (if you go to reason) that then the Pope should do as
his master did, and use himself rather more humbly then his master, and not
to pass in pomp and glory above Emperors and Kings, and more like a
Sovereign then a servant. You allege reasons and causes why he should be
thus carried on men's shoulders: but there is a greater reason that he should
not do so, because Christ neither did so nor yet commanded him to do so. I
can show you a good reason why the Pope ought rather to go on his feet then
to be carried on men's backs, and that is this, God has given us feet
purposely to go on, and legs to carry us: but God created not men purposely
to carry the Pope. and also here is an other reason, Christ was never carrted
on men's shoulders, then it is not meet for the Pope being far under him to
be carrted many times on men's backs: Christ went on foot in as great
thronges of people as the Pope, then it is reason that the pope go in as great
thronges of people as Christ: Christ the son of God read but one day in all
his life, and that was but on an Ass, then the pope ought not to presume to
ride many days upon men. The Jews had more occasion to see Christ then the
people have now to see the pope, yet Christ rode not on men's shoulders that
men might see him but he went a foot: but the pope because he will needs
be unlike Christ, he is borne on men's shoulders for that he would be
seen: the pope must needs ride in a chair on men's shoulders, or else you say
he cannot conveniently bless the people: but Christ could help the blind,
heal the lame, and do good to all people, and yet went on foot, which did
more good then the popes blessings, Little Zacheus Luke. 19.
because he would see Christ, did get him by into a tree: But Christ got him
not on men's shoulders because he would be seen of little Zacheus. You
excuse the Pope in this his ryding in a chair on men's backs, because otherwise
the people should not receive his (...). It seems hereby that the Popes
blessing does descend but not ascend, and falls down ward, but cannot go
upward: So that if the people be above the Pope, his blessing will do them
no good, but if the Pope be above them, then it will do them great pleasure,
and so they shall never be hungry as long as they list not eat. Yea and by
this your great reason, it seems that the Pope must see them whom his
blessings must pleasure. You had need take heed yt your Pope be not blind,
for then all the virtue of his blessings is quite gone.

But whereas you make such a great necessity, that the Popes on these festiual
days must thus be carried to bless yt people, I would know who (...) this at
their hands and who (...) them do it: who sets them on work: forsooth
neither God in his word nor Christ in his Gospel. I remember that Christ
bade his Apostles go into all the world and preach: but he never bade the
Pope ride on Math. 28.
men's shoulders in (...) Peter's Church of Rome, to bless the people. And now
because God has not willed the pope to ride thus (...) on men's shoulders to
bless yt people, neither Christ has taught or commanded him, to take such a
glory upon him, but clean contrary to learn of him to be humble and meek.
Therefore the Devil the prince of pride, has set him on work, to ride thus
gloriously and stately upon men's shoulders, far passing either Emperor or
king, and therefore he must pay him his wages, for god will pay none wages, but
such as he sets on work, and that labor in yt work yt he wills the^:
whose work is only to be found in Gods word, and whatsoever work it be: if it
be not there to be found, (though it seem never so good) it is none of Gods
work. Wherefore all the reasons yt you are able to bring, cannot prove the
Popes (...) and glorious riding (...) men's shoulders, to he so necessary, as
you would have us believe: because God never commanded it, neither Christ his
son did use it, nor allowed it. Therefore though you commend the pope for his
pomp to be as the (...) of Christ: yet you have rather proved him for his
pride to be Antichrist.

The 24. part.
AMong other of your exercises at Rome, in on of the 24. part.
popes Colleges, you commend this that follows, (...). Page (...).
saying: In the beginning of every month, they come al together in their hall,
and there after some prayer made, each man takes by lot, a little scroule of
paper, wherein three things are written, first the name of the festival day of
some Saint of that month to come, Secondly some rare sentence of scripture,
Thirdly some special thing which the whole College much tendreth. The first is
written, for that each man shall take that Saint which falls to his lot, for
his peculiar protector under God that month to pray for him: for which cause,
each man reads the life of his Saint, and notes some virtue but of the same
for his own imitation, etc.

Hereby it appears they cast (...) who can happen on the best Saint to be
their protector under god that month. They have one good turn that it is but
for a month, for they that happen on an (...) Saint, may happily light on a
better yt next month. But I would feign know who taught or willed you to
draw lots for Saints to be your protectours: I am sure yt neither Christ nor
his Apostles taught it or used it: Therefore though the papists and Jesuits
do so, yet we that are Christians dare draw no such lots. If Christ the
son of GOD be not a sufficient protector: then I would wish you to cast
lots for the Saints to be your protectours: But surely in my judgment, if
Christ the son of God be not able to protect us, I can hardly believe that
Saints that were but his servants are able to do it.

In deed the Apostles (after Judas had hanged himself), did Acts. 1.
cause lottes to be cast for a fellow to be joined with them in their
Apostleship: But I never heard that any of the Apostles did cast lots for to
have Moses, David, or any of the Prophets to be their protectours either for
a month, a week, or a day. There are certain Heathenish people that have a
new God or protector every day, for the first thing they see in the morning
(whatsoever it be) that they take for their God all that day. But you (as it
seems) have a better confidence in your Saints then they have in their gods,
for be they good be they evil, you keep them for a month.

Mark in what devilish dreams you are drowned, by refusing Gods word: Do
you think that the Saints can protect you better than Christ? Do you think
that they that could not be saved without Christ, can save and defend you
better than Christ: Can sinners and the sons of men, give you better than
Christ that was sinnelesse and the son of God: How are you blinded: how are
you be witched: Christ has taught us to pray unto God, and shall the pope
teach you to pray unto Saints: Christ says, Come unto me all Mat. 11.
ye that labor and are laden, and I will ease you. He does not say cast lots
for the Saints every month, that they may protect you and pray for you. But if
the Saints of God might be your protectours, (as they cannot) yet you had
need to take heed, for if the popes Saints be mingled among them, you may
chance hit of a Sathanist in steed of a Saint. And if you mean to imitate
your Saint, such a Saint you may light on, that you may learn of him to be
rather a traitor then a true man.

I fear that some of you by your lots have chanced on Thomas Becket, in
steed of Saint Thomas the Apostle: and then it is no marvel (because you are
bound to imitate your Saint) that you have learned of him to be disobedient
and traitors to your Queen, as he was stubborn and obstinate to his king.

I marvel that you were not ashamed to write and publishe such a rydiculous
exercise, and such a lothsume lotterie, do you think that it can go unespied
even of them that be but young beginners in the Gospel of Christ: Can you
persuade your reader that professes christ and fears God, (though he be
never so simple) that God has appointed the Saints to be protectours under
him: As Christ has appointed the pope to be his vickar under him, so God has
appointed the saints to be protectoures under him: for as true is the one as
the other. Thus you thought you had much commended your religious Romans for
casting lottes for the saints: but you have set forth their folly, for
refusing of Christ.

The 25. part.
THough you would have us believe that you are godly, 25. part.

these curtezans pay tribute to the pope, and if they did (as they do not) yet
were it a punishment, and not an allowance of their life, as when you make a
catholic pay money for his not coming to the Church, you do not allow thereby
of his absence, but you punish him for it.

Surely the pope had need reward you for finding out such a shift to keep bp
his stews, you say if they paid a tribute, yet were it a punishment, and not
an allowance of their life. You will grant I am sure that theft is no greater
offense before God than forntcation or whoredom, nay it seems it is not so
great, for yt ye punishment there of was less by Moses law. Now if a prince
should suffer his subieces to steal that would: So that they should for
their stealing pay him yearly a tribute, and have none other harm for their
stealing: that same tribute were then but a punishment and not an allowance of
their cuill life. (If we may believe you) if thieves might have none other
punishment for (...) but to pay yearly a tribute therefore, do you not chinke
there would be more the eues than there be: yes I warrant you: Even so
seeing the yearly paying of money to the pope is the chiefest punishment that
the Curtezans (...) for their whoredom, I think thereby there are not fewer
whores in Rome, nor less fornication there committed.

And as they that should pay money as a punishment for stealing, would steal
the ofter, whereby they would be sure to have enough to live on, beside the
su^me appointed for their punishment: So assure your self, the Curtezans and
harlottes of Rome procure the more to sin with them, because they will have
as much as they can get, over and besides the yearly Sum they pay to the
Pope.

Which you, very advisedly, allow for a punishment for their fact, and not
as an allowance of their life, for this is your reason, When we make a
Catholic pay money for his not coming to Church, we do not allow thereby of
his absence, but we punish him for it.

This will prove but a false Simile, though it show fair at the first. You
compare whoredom, which is wickedness, to going to the Church to hear the
word of God, which is godliness. And so where we pay money to the poor for
not doing godly: your Curtezans pay money to the pope, for committing
wickedness. And further one may be absent and from the Church, and displease
not God: but every one displeases God that commits whoredom. So that your
Curtezans pay their money to the pope that they may sin: but they that come
not to the Church with us, pay money to the poor, because they do not honor
God. And thus if you mark this well, the paying of the whoores money to the
Pope is to an evil end: but the paying of our money to the poor, is to a good
end. Therefore by these your former words, you thought to cast such a miste
before your simple readers eyes, that the Pope does not evil in suffering the
Stews up in Rome, nor in his taking money of them therefore.

But mark this well, do you think, if there were a street or two of
protestants in Rome, that the pope would suffer them to use their religion,
for paying him a certain (...) of money every year: and would he take that
money as a punishment for using their religion? I think not. If they should
offer him money in such a case, he would not take it of them, because he
will not allow them there to use their religion: neither would he think
that the payment of that money were a sufficient punishment for such an
offense. Therefore if the pope should allow the preaching and hearing of the
Gospel by taking of money of the protestants: Then the pope does allow
whoredom in Rome by taking money of the Curtezans and harlottes there. And if
the pope would not think it a due punishment for Protestants to pay money
to him for preaching and hearing the word of God: then the paying of money to
the pope by the Curtezans, can not be a sufficient punishment for their
whoredom, which is diuelishe and damnable. Yet you and the pope can be content
to punish whoredom with paying of money. and to suffer them still to live in
the same: But the children of God that profess the Gospel, and that do
abhor whoredom, may not be punished by paying of money, but even with paying
their heart blood, and with the loss of their lives. What a detestable doctrine
is this of yours, that makes you think money to be a sufficient punishment for
whoredom: But torments and cruel death is scant sufficient for professing the
word of God, which does utterly for bid and condemn whoredom.

The 26. part.
AS you went about to excuse the Pope in taking money of the Curtezans of Rome:
so here you take upon 26. part.
you to defend ye pope for suffering or maintaining his (...) stews in Rome,
for these are your words that follow:

But here, before I pass any further, I must say a word or Disco. page (...)
two touching the stews in rome, the permissio^ whereof by ye pope, and by
other catholic princes in their cuntries, is accounted so heinous a matter by
our adnersaries, as it may answered, but that we thereby allow of unchaste
life. Which is a most false and wrongful charge, as may appear by that which
follows. First the pope with all the Catholics that ever wrote, condemns
and detesteth the act of simple fornication as a deadly sin and damnable to
the doers without repentance. And our adversaries shall never be able to
charge truly our Catholic doctrine with the contrary.

It seems you would be known to be a proctor for the pope in the suffering
and upholding of his Stews, and also for the Catholic princes, but if we and
these countries that have no such Catholic kings as you mean, should have
houses of stews: your words import yt you would not allow us nor them
therein. Therefore the Catholics have a preeminence of the protestants, for
it is lawful (by your law) for them to commit whoredom, and to have Stews,
but for protestants it is not Well though the pope and you will not allow us to
have whores: yet God and his son Christ does permit us to have wives.

And if you take me for an adversary of your religion, then I have already
charged you withal, and proved in my said book called a persuasion from
papistrie, yea and also in this book, that your popish decrees, your doctors
and doctrine, do not condemn it, but maintain and defend it.

But lest you have forgotten it, I will put you in remembrance with this that
does follow Laurentius valla being one of the Cannons of Rome (and therefore
one of your Catholic (...) lib. 1. cap. 38.
Church and doctrine) wrote thus: Omnino nihil interest vtrum cum marito coeat
mulier an cum amatore: Undoubtedly there is no difference whether a woman keep
company with her husband or with her lover. And further it is thus noted in
the decrees of the pope, qui non habet (...), (...). 34. is qui 34.
loco illius concubinam debet habere: He that has not a wife, in stead of her
must or ought to have a concubine. Parisiis anno (...).


Also the gloss of the constitutions of Otho (which will not I hope be
refused for a witness) says thus, It seems that the Church (of Rome) ought
to dissemble the fault of whoredom, for the popes Marshall in deed receives
tribute or pention of whores. Constable. Othonis de (...). clericorum remouend. It
seems that the Catholic writer that wrote this gloss, did not greatly
condemn or detest either simple or double fornication, unless dissembling or
wincking at whoredom be a condemning or detesting of the same. Whereby it does
not only appear that all your Catholic writers have not condemned and
detested simple fornication: but also that the Curtezans have paid tribute to
the pope, though you have defended the contrary.

Diverse such I could bring, but these are sufficient for a taste, for you may
feel by these how sweet the rest be. If such lessons as these condemn
fornication, then the pope and all the Catholic writers that ever worte do
condemn and detest the same: But seeing Laurentius valla, that was one of your
catholic religion, and these notes and gloses of the popes decree, do allow
and maintain it: then I have both charged truly your Catholics withal, and
have also proved, that some of your Catholics (as you call them) have not
condemned and detested simple fornication as deadly (...) and damnable: but
have allowed and permitted it, as though it were no such damnable sin.

Thus hereby it appears that your words are but wind, and that all your
talk is not truth. If your popes condemn and detest fornication, then why
have they given licenses to keep Concubines and Harlottes, as it has been
most manifest in diverse countries. Nay in diverse places under the pope, the
Bishops and officialls have not Acts and (...). page 835.
only suffered Priests to have Concubines, so that they paid certain sums
of money: but also compelled chaste Priests, or Priests that would have
lived without Concubines, to pay tribute for Concubines, affirming that the
Bishop had need of money: which being paid, it should be lawefull for
them either to live chaste, or to keep Concubines at their pleasure. Therefore
I must (...) say, if licencing does signify detesting, and allowing does
signify condemning, that then your Popes (...) Catholic prelates, do detest
and condemn simple (...) cation: But if allowing and licensing, do signify
allowing and licensing, then your holy Popes and prelates have allowed and
licensed, both simple and double fornication.

Therefore I marvel how you can without blushing, affirm that the Pope with
all the catholics that ever wrote, did condemn and (...) fornication, as is
before said, seeing the contrary is so evident and manifest. The Stews
suffered at Rome, does argue that the Pope, does rather allow fornication,
then condemn or detest it.

Then you say further: Secondly, notwithstanding Discou pa. 99.
this detestation, the civil Magistrate: may for the avoiding of a worse
inconvenience, tolerate or permit this sin in some degree, without fault,
and without any allowing of the sin it self: As GOD does tolerate with
wicked men, and with many wicked acts in the world, which he detesteth, and
might notwithstanding let them if he would: and yet he does not allow of
them, for that he permits them.

Though this be a Jesuits judgment, yet we (...) may not take it for gospel.
Where have you learned that the civil Magistrate may, for the avoiding of a
worse inconvenience tolerate sin in any degree that God has forbidden, (yea
and that without fault) (...) it seems that you Jesuits can pick out more
for mainteyning of whoredom out of the popes Iawe, then we christians can
learn out of Gods law, (for by Gods law sin can not be suffered without
fault that we can find.) If this be true that you say, then the civil
Magistrate may tolerate and suffer loyterers, vagaboundes and rogs (that will
not work) to steal, thereby to avoid the inconvenience of hunger or
famishing. But as work and labor is the right remedy to expel hunger, and
not theft or stealing: So marriage is the right remedy, of your inconvenience
(whatsoever it be) and not the suffering of the stews or whoredom.

But I would feign know what worse inconvenience it is, that will be
avoided, by suffering the stews, or permitting this (...) sin of whoredom:
(for you keep that secret to your self, and have not here showed it). Can
there come any worse inconvenience by not suffering the stews, or by
banishing whoredom, then whoredom is it self (...) (which God has
forbidden, and does utterly decest) If you knew well what inconvenience it
were, I think you would have uttered it: But because you conceal it, I will
now reveal it. If your pope should put down his Stews, and not permit
whoredom: Then it would drive the fornicatours (...) whores of Rome to
marry. This I perceive is your inconvenience, that you count worse then
suffering the Stews or whoredom. But though you Jesuits count marriage a
worse inconvenience then whoredom: yet Christ and S. Paul count whoredom a
worse inconvenience than marriage.

By your words that follow, it seems that you take it to be as lawful for
the pope, and the civil Magistrates (...) tolerate their Stews and woredome:
as for God to tolerate the wicked men of the world to commit such wicked
acts as they daily do. And so, because God suffers such wicked sinners to
live (as you think) unpunished: Therefore the pope may suffer the whores in his
stews to commit whoredom without controlement. Whereby it appears that you
allow the pope to do as God does, verifiyng thereby the saying of Abbat
Panormiran, who wrote thus: That (sin excepted) De elect. cap. licet. Abb.
the pope can do in a manner, all that God can do. So that by this your holy
Catholic doctrine, whatsoever God does or has done, the Pope may claim to
do the like. As thus, God was angry with king Saul and thrust him out of his
kingdom because he killed not king Agag at his commandment, being Gods
enemy: now if yt pope may follow God and do as he did, the^ he may displace
such kings and thrust them out of their kingdoms yt will not kill his enemies ye
professors of Gods word at his commandment. I think by this example the pope
learned of God to depose emperors and kings as they have done. Also God
suffered it not to rain of three years and six months among the
Israelites (...) (...) he was (...) (...) disobeying of (...): (...) (...) your
(...) arguments the pope may keep (...) here in England without rain, with
whom he is angry because we disobey him and his laws (which he is not able
to do.) If the Pope might or could do thus, as you seem to allow him: we
should have had neither prince, prosperity, peace, nor plenty, fo long as
we have had.

But though you allow the pope to do that that God can do, in tollerating
sins and wickedness: yet God and the pope are far unlike in their
tollerating and suffering the same. For whereas God does tolerate and suffer
wicked sinners to see whether they will repent and amend or not, who, if they
do not, then he punishes them, one way or other: The Pope clean contrary,
does tolerate and suffer the Curtezans and whores of his Stews for money to
sin unpunished though they neither repent nor amend. And whereas God does
not suffer them that he takes for his loving children to sin uncorrected:
The pope suffers his catholic Curtezans of the Stews in Rome (whom he
takes as his dear darlinges) to commit whoredom daily without any
punishment. But I muse at this, that the pope can follow God in suffering of
sin: and can not follow him in punishing of sin. For as God does tolerate
many wicked sinners: so has he and (...) daily punish many wicked sinners.
But how can you prove that God does (...) tolerate wicked men to commit
wickedness, that he does not punish them for it: nay I am sure that no such
wicked sinners do escape Gods punishment: though the (...) and whores of the
Popes Stews do escape the popes punishemente.

For was not all the whole world drowned for their wickedness, except Noah
and his family: was not zodom and Gomorra with all the Countries thereabout
destroyed with fire and (...) from Heaven for their (...) sin (...) with many
(...) (...) and destroyed, as well (...) as perticularlye, which were too
much for me to (...) (...) And though you think that God tollerateth many
to commit such wickedness (...), that he detesteth, yet I am sure you cannot
prove that he takes money of them to permit them to sin, as the Pope does
on the Curtezans in Rome, for their whoredom. And it may be that some wicked
men are (...) punished of God that you think God (...) tolerate to sin
unpunished, for God does correct and chasten his own children though he
loves them never so (...): (for whom God loves him he chasteneth) Now if
God chasten and correct his dear and loving children, (live they never so
virtuously) will he not punish the wicked that wallow in detestable sins,
though it seems to you, that he does tolerate them to sin unpunished: One
may be punished of God for his wickedness though a (...) does not know of it.
God has his secret punishments in store for the wicked, which they shall
taste when it shall please his divine Majesty. Yea and that which perhaps you
take for no punishment, I take to be the greatest punishment of all. Do you
think there can be a greater punishment, then for God to give men over to
their own lusts: And greedily to take pleasure in sin and to wallowe in all
wickedness: I think not. And though you do see them prosper daily in health,
wealth, pleasure and prosperity, without any misfortune, (as Policrates did
that was one of the thirty tyrants) and though God should so tolerate them in
their wickedness that he detesteth, shall they therefore escape his punishment
think you: No I warrant you: for those that God (...) suffer to live so
wickedly, and to draw sins together as it were with (...), and to heap up
sins one upon another, without any worldly plague or punishment, seem to be
the children of wrath, and unless they repent and turn to God, doubtless
shall be punished in the torments of hell, which far exceed all ye earthly
punishments that can be devised, and whereas the one continues but a while,
the other shall be for (...) and never end. Therefore though God does tolerate
(as you say) with wicked men and with many wicked acts in the world which he
detesteth: yet they are not unpunished. therefore as you seem to (...),
unless to be in the intolerable and endless pain of hell be no (...) but
the whoores of the Popes Stews are not punished of the Pope, whose sins it
seems he does not detest but rather favor, because he suffeereth the same
without punishment. And although God does tolerate and suffer many most wicked
and abominable sinners unpunished in this life to yt sight of the world,
according to his secret purposes only known to himself: yet it is too much
for you (though you are a Jesuit) to allow the Pope to tolerate and suffer
the wicked sin of whooredome which the Almighty God has flatly forbidden.
Therefore you were best to council the pope to let God alone in his doings,
and not to presume to do as be (...), but to do as he (...), unless you
would have him to clime into heaven with Lucifer as (...) angel, and to fall
into (...) with him as a Devil.

THe^ after you say thus. Thirdly (...) a noughty and wicked 27. (...).

tolerated without fault. (The corruption and lew de inclination of men
supposed) If you learned this of Christ, I would have you show where I
should find it. If it be the Apostles doctrine I would know which of them
taught it: But if it be your own devise, (as I suppose it is) then I do not
take your words to be of (...) authority, especially when they repugne the
Scriptures (...) these do. Therefore I will be so bold to reprove the same
with the words of Saint Paul, (if he may be allowed for (...). 3.
a sufficient author against you) who affirms, that their damnation is just
that do evil that good may come thereof. Now if by Saint Paul's words, we
may not do a small evil whereof great goodness may follow: Then the pope
may not suffer shameful Stews for whoredom, which is a heinous sin whereof
great mischiefs do come. And if their damnation be just that permit a small
evil whereof goodness may grow: Then their (...) must needs (...) (...) that
do or permit many abominable sins, yt bring great mischiefs withal.

(...) it appears that you have a deep consideration of the corruption and
lewd inclination of men, but to correct such corruption, Saint Paul teaches
us saying: To avoid 1. Cor. 7.
fornication let every man have his wife. But you that have a deeper sight
herein then S. Paul, think it is better if me^ be full of corruption and
lewdly inclined) to have Stews set up and suffered, that every man may have his
harlot.

I would have thought that a wicked thing and a fault had been so nigh a
kin, yt a wicked thing could not have been tolerated or suffered without a
fault. But now because you say so I must change my mind, and think, that one
may sin or suffer a wicked thing without fault. Doubtless you Jesuits have
a merueilous deep learning, you have here loosed such a knot, and vnioyned
such a joint, that neither Jesus Christ himself, nor all his Apostles did ever
undo. A wicked thing may sometimes be necessary with Jesuits, because
idolatry and blaspemie is counted most holy with the^ always: but a wicked
thing cannot be (...) meet with true Christians at any time. Surely you have
waded very deep, for maintaining of the Popes stews, and his suffering of yt
same: yea and you proved very learnedly before, that if the Curtezans paid
money to yt (...), yet it were a punishment, and not an allowance of their
life. But if one may be punished with paying of a noble for stealing xx. pound:
I think that punishment would not make him leave stealing.

The 28. part.
AND then you follow with these words. It appears 28. part.
plainly by Saint Paul who says, that (...) (...). Page 99.
of necessity must needs be: and by Christ, who affirms that scandales
(that is slanders) must needs come, and yet neither Christ allowed of
scandals, nor Saint Paul of heresies. If yt pope allowed no more of whoredom
then Christ did of staunders, nor Saint Paul did of heresies: his Stews at
Rome, would not have been so long up, nor the curtezans there so long
suffered. Mark how you go about to beguile your simple Reader, as though these
words of Christ or Saint Paul, would excuse the popes Stews, or the Pope
for suffering them: and as though the Pope in suffering the Stews, did not
allow the Stews. Christ nor Saint Paul did speak of slanders or of
heresies of any particular Town or City, where they had temporal or worldly
power to suppress the same, (for they had no such government) as the Pope
has at Rome. For if they had, they would not have taken money of the
scandalers or heretics as a due punishment therefore: as the Pope does for
whoredom at Rome. (which you excuse as a punishment for their evil life) For
though Christ had no worldelie authority, (for that his kingdom was not of
this John. 18.
world) yet he adventured without any worldly commission, to beat out the
buyers and sellers out of the temple, so much Math. 21.
he did detest their violating of the house of God. But if Christ should have
taken money of the said chaungers of money, and so have gone his ways and let
them alone: would it not have been thought that he had allowed their doings
therein for money: Yes I believe: Even so whatsoever you say, the Pope does
allow the whoores of Rome because he takes yearly (...) of them therefore,
yea and is partaker with them in their sins and whoredom: For if he did not
allow the Stews and their whoredom, he would whip the whoores out of Rome
as Christ did the money changers out of the temple, and would either pluck
down the houses of the Stews, or else put honest and virtuous women in them.

Thus though you would have Christ and Saint Paul to defend and boulster the
Pope, for suffering the stews and Curtezans in Rome, yet neither Christ nor
Saint Paul will serve your turn therein. Christ and Saint Paul are much
beholden to you that brings them forth as witnesses for the upholding of
Stews and whoredom. you that are a Jesuit and makes as though none (...)
Jesus more than you, should have produced Jesus in an honester cause then this,
whatsoever you had done by S. Paul: but you are so far in love with the Pope,
that to make him seem honest, you stick not to adventure to make Jesus
Christ dishonest: and to cover the Popes shame, you would defame Christ.
Surely when Christ was here on earth and unglorified, he spoke against
whooredome, and do you think that he being now in heaven and glorified, will
be a boulsterer of whoredom: Christ said when he was here, Whosoever
looks on a woman lusting after her, Math. 5.
has committed aduowtrie with her already in his heart, and do you think now
that he can suffer whoredom it self: If you love Jesus, then bring not Jesus
forth to maintain your Popes Stews and the whoordome in Rome.

The 29. part.
AND further to allow the Pope in permitting the Stews and whoredom you
bring this reason, saying, 29. part.
I might ask, why the protestants in England do permit Discovery. Page 99.
usury by their laws, that is, does not punish men for taking under ten of
the hundredth? I perceive you Jesuits have ripe wits to defend the Popes
Stews, and to approve his taking of money of yt curtezans for their whoredom,
to be lawful. It is a strange matter, that you can learn by our positive
laws to maintain ye popes stews and to allow whoredom: but by our divine
law the Gospel you cannot learn to put down the stews, and to reprove the
Pope for suffering of whooredome. What our Princes laws do herein permit, I
have not to dispute with you: but this I will say, where can you approve, that
any streets with us are appointed for usurers to dwell in as you have for
whores in Rome: Or that they have any special houses to commit usury in for
paying therefore a yearly tribute to our Prince, as your Curtezans have to
commit whoredom for paying a yearly tribute to the pope: or it commonly
known of us where to borowe money upon usury, as every one great and small
do and may know at Rome where the Curtezans do dwell, where any may play the
whooremonger for money that list: no I am sure. If we have any usurers, our
Prince does not know where they dwell: but you have allowed Curtezans in Rome,
and the Pope knows where they remain. And moreover they yt lend money in
this sort with us pay no money therefore to our Prince: But the Curtezans in
Rome, pay money for their whoring to the Pope. So that, it is the tribute and
money that the Curtezans pay yearly to the Pope, that makes him to suffer
the Stews in Rome.

The 30. part.
YOU say that we must needs answer (for that we 30. part.
do permit usury in taking under x. li. in the hundredth) Discovery. Page 100.
that we allow not of the sin, but that we do it for avoiding a greater
inconvenience: which is, least by punishing al usury, (as the Catholic
Church does) no man would lend any money at all. In deed I must needs say
that no perfect and pure Protestants do allow the sin of usury: but I am
sure the Pope does allow and permit the sin of whoredom in the stews at
Rome, because he may redress it and will not. And where you say we do it
least by punishing all usury no man would lend any money at all: So by your
own argument, your Pope will not put down the Stews nor banish the whores of
Rome, least no man should commit any whoredom there at all. This is the great
inconvenience I perceive that your Pope means to avoid by maynteining his
Stews and Harlots in Rome, you may see how the Devil does instruct you to
confound your selves.

The 31. part.
YOU say that there is no Prince in all the world which 31. part.
does or can use more means, then the Pope does, to (...). Page 101.
draw all men from that vice and to reform those miserable women themselves.
etc.

If the Pope have the knowledge of all laws in his breast, and such a heavenly
judgment as he makes men believe he has, then I muse that he can find no
means to bring this his great desire to pass, surely if he would follow ye
example of our late king Edward in two points: he should not need to use so
many needles means as he does. That is, to pluck down the stews, and also
suffer his Priests and Prelates to marry, as King Edward did: Then he
should draw men from that vice and those miserable women from their filthy
living. But as long as he forbids Priests to marry, and suffers the
Stews, and takes money of the Curtezans as a punishment for their sin: (as
you say) he shall never diminish it but rather increase it let him devise what
means he can.

And though he persuade them by Preachers as you say, and yet permits them
for money to continue in the same, it is as though a master should persuade
his servant and give him great warning that he should not rob his
neighbors Orchardes: and yet when he has stolen aples out of them, his said
master is content to take and eat part of the apples that he has stolen,
and never blames him for his offense. For though the Popes Preachers persuade
the Curtezans to refuse their whoredom as you say, yet the pope takes part of
their money that they get in committing their whooredome, and neither punishes
nor chideth them for the same. Whereby they will refuse their whooredome no
more, then the said servant will leave stealing of apples. Thus you like a
learned Jesuit have gone about to excuse the pope in suffering the stews at
Rome, and for taking yearly money of the Curtezans for their abhommable
living, counting it a punishment for their sin not an allowance of their
fault. But if you had been a true and perfect Christian, you would have accused
the Pope for mainteining and permitting such detestable dealings, which Gods
word and the Gospel does utterly condemn.

The 32, part.
Whereas you write that the society of the Anuunciata 32. part.
(in Rome) do bury strangers and Discovery. Page 112.
poor people which die in Rome, causing masses to be said for them, etc. For
their charitable burying of strangers and poor people, and their other
charitable deeds they are much to be commended, so that they do them not for
a deserving reward at gods hand, or as meriting works: But for causing masses
to be said for them, they are utterly to be reproved, for that Gods word does
neither command it nor allow it, nay it is directly against Gods word, and it
is iniurtous to the precious passion of Christ, and therefore in any wise not
to be used, as is proved in my said book called a persuasion from papistrie.

The 33. part.
LAst of all you say, I will add one thing in testimony 33. part.
of the Romans piety and devotion, which many in Discovery. Page 115.
England, will rather laugh at than imitate: which is, that upon Maundie
Thursday before Easter, they use to go to S. Peter's Church late in the night,
whipping the^ selves until the blood stream from their bodies. They go; their
faces all covered, except only two holes to look out at, and upon their bodies
they have only a shirt of sackcloth cut so behind, that their shoulders appear
naked, where, with whipeorde they beat them selves, for more then the space of
one hour together. They go commonly above 600. in a company. The Societies
of the (...) S. Marcellus, and of the Confalons are chiefest in this matter.
And they are each of them an hundredth commonly every year. Now the beaters go
in order, two and two, and between every two beaters, go two other with
torches. To see only this spectacle were a matter to move any man whatsoever.
Besides these Societies, many private men do punish them selves very
grieuoufly in this holy week, for their offenses past. Who covering their
faces in such sort, as they may not be known, they go to all Churches of the
City or the most part, beating them (...) pitifully, until the blood do
run from them in great quantie etc.

This I perceive you have cold us, whereby we may know how full of piety
and devotion the Romans are, but as Christ the son of God knew best of all
other what is true piety and devotion: so he never told us, neither the
Evangelists wrote of any such piety and devotion, as this which you say the
Romans use. Saint Paul wrote a great large Epistle to the Romans, and yet he
did not touch any whitte of such whipping piety in the same. Either Saint Paul
did forget to writ of this your whipping piety (...) devotion in his said
Epistle, or it was not worth the writing in his epistle, or else your pope has
devised a better piety and devotion than is in Saint Paul's Epistle. And now
for that Christ never taught any such whipping piety or devotion, neither the
Apostles ever did preach any such whipping piety or devotion, nor yet any of
the Evangelists did ever write of any such whipping piety or devotion: then
surely according to your doom, I think many English men will rather laugh at
it than imitate it. But truly, I judge it rather to be lamented then imitated
or followed. As these your godly Romans do go before Christ, because they
whippe them selves before he has bid them: Even so they whippe them selves a
day before Christ himself was whipped. For by your saying they whip them selves
on mau^day thursday, and Christ was whipped as the next day after which commonly
is called good Friday. Therefore as we Christians may count that for our good
Friday, because as then Christ was whipped and shed his blood for our sins:
so you Jesuits and Romans may count maunday Thursday, for your good
Thursday, because you whip your selves and shed your blood then for your
offenses. But though you Jesuits or Romans are ashamed in whipping and
shedding your own blood for your own sins, as it seems, for that you
cover your faces that you would not be known: yet Jesus Christ the son of
God was not ashamed to be whipped and scourged, for other and not for him self,
and to shed his heartblood, for the sins of all faithful Christians, because
his face was uncovered that every one might see him and know him. It appears
that your holy and virtuous Romans, that whippe themselves and shed their
own blood for their own sins, neither regard Christ's whippinges. nor
stand need of his blood to wash away their sins: But we that are
faithful Christians do whollye cleave and stick to Christ's whippinges, and
the shedding of his innocent blood, for the putting away of our sins and
offenses. I would feign know who taught you to whip and scourge your selves
and to shed your own blood for your offenses? where have you read it? In
what Scriptures can you find it? what Apostle has preach it? or what godly
Doctor has declared it? if our own whippinges might pardon our offenses, or
shedding of our own blood, could wash away our sins: Then what need
Christ the son of God have come out of his heavenly and joyful kingdom to
this earthly and sorrowful prison, and of a God to become man, and to be whipped
and shed his blood? Can Christ have any greater enemies than you, that thus
blotte out his blood and painful death, which did it only for saving us out
of hell? and apply that to your own whipping and blieding that is only due
to Christ, and that none can (...) but he?

This I will tell you, whether you be (...), or what ever you be, you that thus
whip your selves, yea though you whippe all the blood out of your bodies, for
the putting away of your offenses: neither Christ's whipping, nor his blood
will do you any pleasure, unless you leave this whipping of your selves, and
trust only to his whippings and to the shedding of his blood. You that thus
whippe your selves for your own offenses, you make your selves your own
Christ's: And they that are their own Christ's, shall never dwell in heaven
with Christ.

The mother of Christ was as able to be her own Savior as you, and yet she
never whipped her self nor shed her own blood, but trusted in God to be her
(...), saying: My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit does rejoice
in GOD my Savior.

Here you may well perceive that she trusted not to save her self by whipping
of her self: but she trusted to Jesus Christ that was whipped for her, to
be her Savior, yea though he were her own son.

You have written on the first side of your book (...) words, (whereof
before I have entreated something) There is none other name under heaven given
unto (...) wherein we must be saved. And that is the name of Jesus. Now,
unless you that thus whippe or punish your selves are called by the name of
Jesus: then how can your whippinges save you or put away your offenses? for I
am sure that few or none of your holy. Romans that thus whippe them selves,
are so called, then how can (...) own whippinges save you, or put away your
offenses, for that he must needs be called Jesus, that can and must (...)
us. Mark how you are wounded with your (...) weapon, and stricken down with
your own staff. Thus though you seem to favor the name of Jesus: yet with
your doings you altogether derogate and dishonor Jesus. I do muse that you
that have read the scriptures, and count your self to be so learned in ye
same, yt you can once think (...) these whippers of themselves (though the
whip (...) (...) from the and the flesh from the bones)! can thereby put away
their offenses: Nay thereby they increase their offenses, offending God thereby
most heynously. Truly I can not but marvel that you were not ashamed to put
it into your book, commending thereby the Romans piety and devotion:
Considering the Christian reader must needs think, that thereby they procure
their utter destruction by going about to put away their sins by their
whipping, and shedding of their own blood, which only Christ can do and
none else. Saint Paul was scourged three times with rods, but he neither whipped
him self as your devout Romans do, neither did he say that his (...) or
sins was put away by the whipping of his body: though your Romans (by your
own sayings) do whip them selves very grievously in the week before Easter
for their offenses past. But these your holy Romans after Easter and all the
year after may sin as freshly as ever they did: for what need they care
seeing one days whipping of them selves, will put away a hole years offenses.
Either your doctrine is very false or you are very fools, for if you can whip
away your sins, then what need you fear the popes perilous (...): And if
you may put away your offenses by your whippinges while your are alive, what
need you pay money for masses when (...) are (...): And if you have whipped away
your sins before your death, then what sins have you for the mass to
release after your (...): you thought by this your whipping (...) to extol
your Romans for their (...) but thereby you have blased abroad their folly
and madness.

You say to see only this spectacle were a matter to move any man whatsoever.

In deed this spectacle moves me, though I see it not, to bewail the (...)
foolish and bewitched Ramanes, that with their (...), drive them selves such a
pace to the devil, that he may whippe (...) them in the endelesse pains of
helt: for the ofter they thus whippe themselves, the faster and speedilier they
drive themselves to the devil, if this their whipping would help them to
heaven, the Devil would make them more slow in whipping them selves.
Therefore how mad are your romans that take such pains to go unto hell,
where the torments are endelesse, and the pains never cease. I pray God they
may leave whipping of them selves, and trust only to the whippings of Christ:
And to cease to shed their own blood for their offenses and to put their
whole trust in Christ, that was whipped and shed his precious blood for the
sinues of all them that ever shall be saved. This is your holy religion that
you and your Seminaries seek daily to set up here in England by your
privy practices and secret sedition, to the destruction of your prince and
country as you hope, but to your own confusion I am sure, as you may see if
you will, and some have felt against their wills.

The 34. part.

as follows. Albeit private old men may lack wit, Disco. pa. 136
yet Chirstes old spouse which is the Church can not. If al be true that you
say, then it is so in deed, for you bring none other autour but your self,
neither any argument for proouing of the same. It is impossible but that your
old spouse should be very full of wit, if they have such wise Cardinals
and pregnant pillars as Petrus Asotus and Hosius Hosius (...).
were, that affirmed that the same Council wherein our savior Brent. lib. 20.
Christ was condemned to die, had the holy ghost, and that the same was a just
decree whereby they pronounced that Christ was worthy to die. Moreover he could
not chose but Disti. 13.
be full of wisdom, that wrote upon the popes decree, that the Item in marg.
Jews had committed mortal sin, if they had not nailed Christ to the
Cross. These members of your holy mother your old spouse were no fools I
(...), that took part with Annas and Caiphas against Christ. They might well
have diuelishe wit, but I am sure they had no godly wisdom. In deed the true
Church of Christ which is governed, and taught by the holy ghost can want no
godly wisdom: but your Church of Rome (which you count Christ's old
spouse) has and does lack both learning wit and honesty as before it does
manifestly appear.

That pope was very full of wit, (which you count the chief of your
Church,) that gave judgment and sentence, that they at Ratilpone in Germany,
and the Abbay of Saint Denise in France, had both the whole body of Saint
Denise at once as is before mentioned. He had more wit than Solomon, for
Solomon could make but one child into two half children: but your said
profound and wise pope, made one Saint Denise into two whole Saint Denises.
Belike the Pope thought that seeing every simple and rascal priest could make
Christ's body at one time to be in many places: the^ he being the prince of al
priests was able to make the body of S. Denise to be in two places.

And further your old spouse of Rome can want no wit, because it can not err
if it would, and no marvel, for it can have the holy Ghost in the likeness
of an Owl to instruct it, for in one of your late Councelles in Rome as they
were singing and roaring of Veni creator spiritus, that is Nicol. de Clauengiis.
Come holy ghost, etc. by and by (at their beck and calling) a poor old Owl
amazed with the noise, (thinking belike she was the holy ghost that they
called for so earnestly) leapt out of the hole where she sat, and came down
in the mids of them, and sat amongst them. Thus you may perceive that there
is a great difference between the Spirit of God and the Popes holy Ghost. For
God the holy Ghost descended and appeared to Christ in likeness of a fair
white dove: but the popes holy ghost did discende and appear to the Pope in
the shape of a foul evil favored owl. Surely they are fowlie ouerseene that
will not be guided by your Church that is taught and instructed by such a holy
ghost. Your old spouse can never want (...) that (...) inspired by such a holy
spirit.

and learning to his reproach as you thought, and commending your own follies,
you discommend and go about to discredit my said book called A persuasion
from papistrie. But though you decide it without any reproving or consuting
thereof: yet I have so reproved and confuted such parts of this your discovery
as I thought necessary, and was meet for me to do, that you are so uncovered,
that the wise may see that you dance naked in a net, though you think your
self well enough covered. And these are your words concerning the same. Of
late in the Discovery. Page 1 83.
midst of our persecutions, there came forth a weighty work of 40 sheets
of paper, made by one Thomas Lupton, entitled a persuasion from papistrie, he
would have said a diswasion, but that papistrie and persuasion began both with
a letter. I must needs confess my said book was not published very long
since, it is so lately come forth, that it seems you had no leisure to peruse
the same as you should, for if you had red it as advisedly as many have done:
you would not (I think) have derided it as you have done. You say, it came
forth in the midst of your persecutions. It came forth at such time as it had
pleased God to give me his instrument leave to finishe the same: for of my
self, (I am most certain) I neither began it, proceeded in it, neither
finished it. For if a sparrowe light not on the ground without Mat. 10.
Gods providence: then the pen of a man Gods image does not light on the
paper without Gods direction, yt writes in Christ's cause and indefence of
Gods word.

But that it was in the midst of your persecutions I hardly can think, for
that it were requisite that they should begin, before they be in the
midst. In deed her highness does not persecute you as queen Marie did us,
yet she has power to punish you much more than she does.

And because you have written in derision against my said book, which I am
now in hand to defend, I will now write some part of my words therein
touching this time which you call the midst of your persecution. And these
are my words.

If you would mark but her majesty's power, and knew Asperswasion from
papistry page 50. 51.
what she may do, and weyghe your own doings, and what ye ought to do,
truly you would say then that she is the most miledest and mercifullest
Queen one of them that ever reigned. You think not a miss in her grace and
count her not unmerciful though she put thieves to death for stealing,
which GOD has not commanded to be punished with death: and can not you see
that her Majesty is marvelous merciful, in that she suffers you to live,
for disobeying Gods word, and committing Idolatry, which GOD by his law
has commanded to be punished with death. King Josias (...) the idolatrous
Priestevpon 4. King. 23.
the alters that committed Idolatry, and yet he is reckoned for a Godly king:
But our merciful Queen Elizabeth has not burned the popish priests on the
alters where they committed idolatry in saying of Mass, and worshipped a
piece of bread for the body of Christ (which she might have done if she
would) and yet you count not her for a godly and merciful Queen. You praise
and extol Queen Marie to the heavens for using cruelty, and for burning her
humble and faultlesse Subjects: But if our (...) Elizabeth should use
lawefull severity on her stubborn and disobedient people, Gods foes and her
enemies that desire her death and destruction, the confusion of their country,
and the ruin of this Realm, you would dispraise and slander her, and say
she were a cruel tyrant.

Nay for all her highness has used you so mildely and mercifully as she has
done, yet some of you would darken her deserts (if you could) in saying
most spitefully and falsely, that this is the time of tyranny, these are the
days of persecution, this I grant, but not in England, though you mean in
England. Truly such as do say so, must needs I think speak against their
conscience and knowledge: unless they take mercy for cruelty, and cruelty
for mercy, and then I may say unto them as Esaias said to the Jews, Woe be to
you that call evil good and good evil etc. If this be the time of tyranny
and persecution, when you that are manifest enemies to your Queen and country
before well proved are suffered to live peaceably, to enjoy your goods quietly,
to go at your liberty, or imprisoned to fare daintily, and there to live
merrily, or to be releast upon surety: Then what was Queen Mary's time, when
her simple, humble and faultlesse subjects were cruelly imprisoned, in stocks
and chains and other engines tormented, most tyrannously racked, their friends
to come to them not suffered, on the bare boordes and ground lodged, to have
pen and ink and candle light not permitted, for want of meat to be
famished, in prisons privily to be murdered, and abroad in every man's eyes to
be burned.

That time of Queen Mary to all wise men, may rather seem to be the time of
cruelty, tyranny, and persecution, than this mild and merciful time of our
Queen Elizabeth.

I beseech God to open your eyes to see how her grace does persecute you, for
if you did see (yet I fear some are blind for the nonce) you would then say,
that she persecuteth you none other wise, than the loving father does his
child, and as the good scholemaster does persecute his scholar that he would
feign have to learn. Thus much concerning your now persecution, I have
declared in my said book, whereby it may plainly appear, that yours is
rather a pleasant pastime then a painful persecution, to that that the
Protestants felt in Queen Mary's time: therefore you cannot (...) say that my
said book came forth in the midst of your persecutions, but in the midst
of your easy and careless living.

of Christ they were counted great for that it was all she had. Even so that
my said simple book (being al yt I was able to do) may be counted light in
your judgment, but before God I am sure it is so weighty, that it will weigh
down all your learned books that you write for the maintenance of the Pope
and your Romish Church. And though in (...) you name it a weighty work: yet I
have proved in good earnest that the book wherein you deride it, is but a very
light work, for that this my answer hitherto has weyed it clean down. But
though you count it a very simple and light work: yet I must content my self
there with, for so the Popes learned Doctors counted and esteemed the
Scriptures. For Ludouicus a Canon of the Church of Ludouicus citatur ab

The scriptures as one man both truly and merrily said, is like a nose of wax,
that easily suffers it self to be drawn backward, and forward, and to be
molded and fashioned, this way, and that way, and howsoever ye list. Thus
reverently did your Doctors of your Romish Church write of the most holy
Scriptures. You wrote immediately before these words, It is a world to see
what pillars of defense they have got, what grave writers in their cause, what
books they suffer to come out against us daily. But may not I say to you and
that more rightly and truly: It is a most lamentable thing both to see and to
hear, what pernicious and pestiferous pillars, your Church of Rome has, and
what impudent writers you have in your cause, and what beastly books your holy
father and you do suffer to be in printe and go abroad, wherein the holy
Scripture and word of God is made a jesting and (...) stock: The simplest,
the vnlearnedst, and the youngest writer that is or ever was amongst yt
professors of the Gospel, may be counted grave writers, in comparison of
these your now mentioned doctors. Whatsoever you count of our writers, you
never found that we wrote so irreverently and so decestablie of the holy
word of God the tryar of all truth, as these and other of your Romish grave
writers have done. These your grave writers might be ancient and grave men to
see to: but they have written most childishly, (...), fondly, falsely and
diuelishly. It is not the gravity of the person that makes the writing grave,
but the grave and true writing shows the gravity of the person: therefore if
you consider well, your grave pillars yt wrote as is before, in yt defense of
your church: you have no great cause mockingly and restingly to call us grave
writers, as though none but they of your (...) can be grave writers.

And now for that your Popes pillars and your grave writers, do call the
scriptures which is the holy word of GOD, dead Ink, a liuelesse letter, a
dumb Judge that cannot speak, a black Gospel, inken Divinity, and a nose
of wax, whereby they took the holy Bible not to be any weighty work, but a
book of small importance and very light: (though it be the weightiest work
of all other) then it is no marvel, though you count my book to be a very
light work. But I fear (if you turn not to the Gospel from the Pope, as my
said book does (...) persuade you) that it (as light as you make it) will
prove heuie against you at the last day, and then rise as a witness against
you Jesuits, as the people of Niniuee that repented at the preaching of Jonas,
and the Queen of Saba, shall rise and witness against the Jews, that
repugned or withstoode Christ. For if the dust that the Apostles did shake
from their feet shall be a witness against the unbelieving and wicked Jews:
then it is not unlike but that my said book, which does (...) persuade you to
embrace the Gospel, shall be a witness against you obstinate and incredulous
Jesuits. Though my said book be forty sheets of paper, yet you have not
confuted any one word thereof, neither approved yt there is any lie in the
same, (though in pour margent you write Luptons lies) and whereas you have
written scant the fourthpart of one sheet in deriding and discrediting my said
book of forty sheets, without confuting or reproving any one part of yt same:
I have now written above twenty sheets of paper, against you for deprauing
and slaundering the same, wherein I have most manifestly reproved, diverse
parts of your (...) book of Discovery, besides the defense of mine own
book.

If I had left my name out of my book as you have done yours: you could not so
rightly have hit of the same. But as they that have a true and just cause in
hand need not fear to utter their name, (as I am most sure I have): So they
yt deal unjustly, and take partiu a vile and noughtie cause, are glad to hide
their name as now you have done. Which co^cealing of your name does not a
little discredit your cause.

The 37. part.
BEcause I have entitled my said book, A persuasion 37. part.
from papistrie, therefore it seems you judge that the (...) is utterly
disgraste, and for that you would have it known, that you are able to teach or
rather co^troule me, you say I would have said a diswasion, but that papistry
and persuasion began both with a letter. Who would have thought that it had
lain in a Jesuit to know what a Christian would have said, your name does
import that you should be well learned, but I would never have judged until
I did hear it of your self, that you had been so deeply learned as to know
a man's thought, you say (as shall appear hereafter) that it seems I have
been some Musicion, but whatsoever I have been, it is not unlike but that you
have been or are some fortune teller: for you that can declare a man's thought,
can easily tell folks their fortune. It seems to me that as the Pope has a
heavenly judgment in his breast, so you have worldly men's thoughts in your
bosom. But least you should take too deep a conceit in your knowing of men's
thoughts, to put you out of doubt you have myste of my thought, it was never
in my mind to say a Disuasion. I know not your age no more than I know your
name, but it may be yt before you ever knew any letter of the book, yt I
knew the difference between persuadere and disuadere. And now that you have
mist my thought, I will not stick to tell you (...) thought.

Because my whole drift in my said book is to persuade you and all other to
Gods word from Papistrie, (...) for that in my judgment the title would have
been too long, if I should have said, A persuasion to Gods word from
papistrie, I thought it good, (for the shortness of the title) to leave out
Gods word (as a thing to be understood) and to entitle it a persuasion from
Papistrie, as I did in deed, thus I have not only showed you that you have
mist of my thought (as good a Clarke as you are) but also my very intent and
thought in intitling my said book, as it is. And though I could not
sufficiently prove the contrary, but that there had been some error in this
word Persuasion, and that the sense did require this word, Disuasion,
(whereby it ought to have been a disuasion from Papistrie): yet you know,
this word Disuasion is seldom or never used especially among the common
people, for whose sakes I made my said book as wellas for the learned. And as
I wrote it to allure Papists to Gods word, so I made it to make protestants
and the simple people to shun papistrie. For every one says commonly upon
occasion, I persuaded him from play, I persuaded him from drunkenness, I
persuaded him from stealing, I persuaded her from folly, and such like: and not
I disuaded him from play, I disuaded him from drunkenness, I disuaded him from
stealing, or I disuaded her from folly, so that this is to be considered, that:
Loquendu^ and scribendum cum multis, Sapiendum cum paucis. Therefore, if I had
used persuasion, which the most do know and use in steed of disuasion, which
few do understand and use, though there had been some small error by
oversight, as by good foresight there was none, (as before is well proved): yet
me thinks you being a Jesuit and a professor of Jesus, should rather have
borne with an oversight or an unwilling error, then to write and publish that
for a fault which is no fault at all.

But if you had not contrould me thus in the intiteling of my book, rather of
malice then of matter, and of curiosity than of cause, to the disabling of my
learning the more to extol your own knowledge: you your self would not have
offended in the like, yea and that so manifestly, that by no means you are
able to excuse it. For in the 110. page or side of your said discovery, (being
the seventh leaf of G. the second side and second line) you have discovered
your own dishonest dealing, in these words that follow: Therefore have
Discovery. Page 100.
the noble matrones of Rome procured an other house, called Casapia, behind
Pantheon, where these women may come for a time to prove what they will resolve
upon, in which time the said matrones, do omit no (...) to persuade them from
all dishonestie for the time to come etc. Here a Christian has taken a
Jesuit napping, for you say that the matrones do omit no means to (...) them
from all dishonestie. I know not what law you have amongst you, but I would
think it is as lawful for a Christian to say a persuasion from Papistrie, as
for a Jesuit (...) say a persuasion from dishonestie. Therefore where you
write, I would have said a disuasion, but that papistrie and persuasio^ began
both with a letter, now do I write that you should have said disuasion,
because dishonestie and disuasio^ begin both with a letter. And as you think
that papistrie beginning with a P. did put me in mind to say persuasion
because it began also with a P: So I think that dishonestie beginning with a
D. should like wise have put you in remembrance to have said disuasion
because it began also with a D. And as by your words I had some occasion to say
a persuasion from papistrie, because papistrie and (...) began both with a
letter: yet you had no such occasion to say a persuasion from dishonestie,
because dishonestie and persuasion begin with contrary letters. Thus as the
wicked through Gods goodness fall many times into the same pits that they make
for the Godly: so you being a Jesuit are (...) fast in your own snare, which
you laid for a Christian.

In this your disabling of my skill in the intitling of my said book, thereby
to bring your own knowledge in credit, you have gained as the vain glorious
Priest did, that (to increase his own glory in learning) controuled a young
scholar Mark this.
for speaking true latin. Which was thus, a man having a son at home with
him whom he had put to learning, being very desirous, to know whether he had
profited well or not: desired the Parson or Uicar of the Parish to examine and
appose his said son. And then the said Priest (being both curious and vain
glorious) asked the young man what was latin for a Priest? To whom he
answered, Sacerdos, no said the Priest, therein you are deceived: For who
has the chiefest learning or wisdom but priests: Therefore Sapientia is a
very fit latin word for a Priest, wherewith the sober and wise young man
held him content, then immediately the Priest seeing a Cat, said to the said
young man, I pray you what is latin for a Cat: The young man answered him that
Catus was Latin for a Cat, no said the Priest a Cat has very sharp nails,
and therefore Asper is the right latin word for a Cat: whom the young man did
not contrary. And the said Priest as he was sitting by the fire, asked the
said Scholar what was latin for fire: Forsooth said he Ignis, that is not
so said the Priest, for when a man comes in very cold, what makes him more
glad then a good fire: Therefore there is no fitter name for fire then
Laeticia, all which words ye Scholar kept well in his mind, but yet said
nothing. Then as they al walked abroad after in the yard, the Priest espying
a ponde or ditch with water, said to the Scholar, what is latin for water:
Then the Scholar told him that Aqua was latin for water, no said the Priest
you are wide, for as there is a merueilous great abundance of water as well on
the maine land as in the deep and broad Sea: so the best latin word that can
be for water is abundantia, and as they walked a little further the Prtest
espying a barn, said to the scholar, tell me what is latin for a Barn:
then the young man said that Horreum was latin for a Barn, yt is not so
said the Priest, for what greater joy can be to a man than to see his Barn
full of corn: Therefore Gaudium is the true latin word for a Barn. When
the Scholars father heard, that the Priest contraried his son in every
thing that he asked him, he was very angry with his son and said, all that
he had spent on him was in vain. Sir said the Priest your son will do well
enough, he has not yet the years to atteine to our learning. And thus he made
ye simple and unlearned man believe, yt he had controuled his son rightly,
whereas he did it but to set forth his own vaineglory (as you have done). This
young scholar remembering well the priests new latin, thought to controlle him
with an example without any arguments, though the priest controlled him with
blind arguments without any example, and so, soon after he got a Catte
and tied a fire brand at her tail, and put her into the priests barn that
was full of corn, and when he had so done, he came to the priests window and
cried aloude saying, O sapientia, sapientia, Asper currit cum Laeticia, and
nisicitius veneris cum abundantia, nunquam intrabis in gaudium. Which is by ye
priests own devised latin, (but not according to true latin) O priest priest,
the Catte does run with fire, and unless thou come the sooner with water,
thou shall never enter into thy barn. But for that the priest had forgotten his
own latin, and took the same words truly as they signified in deed,
which is O wisdom wisdom, sharp runs with gladness, and onles thou come
the sooner with abundance, thou shall ueuer enter into joy, the Priest sturde
never a whitte, for he had clean forgot the signification of his own devised
latin, whereby his barn and all his corn was burned. And thus as the priest
gained but little, for controlling the Scholar when he said true: so you have
not gained much in controlling me for the intiteling of my book. And if it
was a great fault in the priest to forget five words of latin which he taught
the young scholar: then it is a foul shame for to forget one English word,
wherein you controled me. And if it were a shame for the priest, for refusing
his own latin, wherewith vain gloriously he discredited the scholar to his
father, and took the true meaning of the scholars words: then it can be no
great praise to you to refuse your own English word, which you wrote
vaynegloriously to diseredite me to all the whole realm, and to use my word
yt you reproved me for. Thus I trust I have defended the title of my book
called A perswation from papistrie, and sufficiently answered you for your
curious comtrolling me, because I put not in (...) for perswation.

The 38. part.
AFter this your controlling of the title of my book, these are your words
that follow: Of this authors estate and calling I can not yet learn, but

that much of his matter (...) from him in ryme. You can not yet learn of my
estate and calling you say, what remedy, I trust you shall well enough
hereafter. But you have one great advantage of me, for you know my name and
so do not I yours, whereby with travel and search you may learn my estate
and calling: but with al ye travel and search yt I am able to make, I can not
learn neither your state nor conditions, because you hide your name. I think
you have left your name out of your book because you would not have us learn
your state and conditions. Though you know not my calling, for all you know
my name: yet I think I know your calling though I know not your name. I take
that your calling is to be a Jesuit and to be one of the Popes sworn
disciples: in which your calling though you rejoice, doubtless you have a great
cause to mourn and lament, if you deeply wey and consider your execrable oath.
I have a calling also though not great in the sight of the world, (wherefore I
think you esteem my work the less) Even Jesus Christ the Son of God that
called Peter and Paul and the rest of the Apostles, has called me. (I thank
his divine Majesty for it) where unto I firmly believe that I was called
before the foundation of the world according to the sayings of S. Paul, for we
know (says he) that all things work for the best unto them that love god,
which also are called of purpose, for those which he knew before, he also
ordained before, that they should be a like fashioned to the shape of his
Son, that he might be the first begotten among many brethren, And whom he
appointed before, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he
justified, whom he justified them also he glorified. Romans 8. Which calling I
take to be no simple nor small calling, nay it is a higher calling then to be
called to be either pope or prince: for thereby I am called to be one of the
members of Christ, which assures me, that the body and head (...) at length
be together. And for that Christ my head (whereof through Gods goodness I
am a member) is now in heaven and shall raygne as a king there for ever: then
I one of his members and part of his body shall reign for ever with him in
heaven. This is my chief calling I thank God. Now if I be called to be an
inheritor of such a kingdom which is the kingdom of heaven passing all other
kingdoms, then my estate can not be simple nor small: for he yt has an estate
of inheritance, in the kingdom of heaven (as I believe verily I have through
Jesus Christ) yt greatest emperor has no such inheritance on the earth, the
fee simple of the best Lordship in the world is not comparable to it.

Now you have learned both my estate and calling, which I my self have told
you, that you should take no further travel nor pains, in learning my estate
and calling: for it seems by your saying, that you mean to try out my
estate and calling, for that you say as yet you can not learn it, as though
you doubt not but at length to find it out. Therefore briefly (to save you some
travel) I me self have showed you my estate and calling.

It may be that this that I have told you is not my estate and calling that
you are so desirous to learn, but my worldly calling and estate: which if you
did know, then it seems you would work wonders. For then belike you would
confute my book, which confuting, perhaps you keep in store until that
time: Thinking belike it is not worthy of confuting unless it were made by some
profounde leaned doctor, or one that is of some great estate and calling. But
if young Daniel, though he was neither doctor of divinity, neither of any
great worldely estate or calling, both confounded and condemned the two learned
wicked judges that were of great estate and worldely calling, that sought the
death of innocent Susanna: then why may not I, though I am neither a profounde
Doctor, neither of any great estate or worldely calling, have sufficient
knowledge, to confute and confound with the word of God, your Iesuitical or
papisticall doctrine and the popes deuilishe Doctors, that persecute, kill and
murder the innocent members of Christ the professors of the Gospel: or else
it may be that the confuting of my said book consists in the knowing of my
calling and estate. You were best never learn my calling and estate, and so
you may have a very good excuse, not to trouble your self with the co^futing
of my book. But if I thought you stayed from confuting of it for lack of
knowledge of my worldly calling and estate: I would my self describe the same
at large unto you, but I hope there is no such mystery, in confuting, unless
it be found out of late by ye sincere society of the Jesuits.

Yet that you may have some better guess of my calling and estate, I will say
thus much unto you (if it will do you any pleasure) I am neither preacher nor
minister (I would to God I were apt or able for such a worthy function) neither
prebendarie, deane, archedeacon, parson nor vicar, neither have nor yet ever
had, any living or worldly profit or commodity by any of the same: Therefore
I trust to escape the name of a notable and infamous liver, wherewith of your
courtesy you have entitled our preachers and ministers.

But if my not being a preacher or minister will not save me from your
slander, I must arm my self patiently to suffer it, for as long as I do not
deserve it, I care the less, (beseeching God that I do not) I had rather a
great deal you should speak evil of me then say well of me, for this I am
sure of, that you wilful and determined papists, and sworn or rather for
sworn Jesuits, (as long as you are so) can not commend a good protestante
nor disprayse an evil papist: therefore if you should commend me, I must
become a papist, from which God defend me, or you must be protestants, which
I beseech God to grant, wherefore I may rejoice if you speak evil of me, for
then I am sure to be a professor of Gods word: but I may lament if you say
well of me, for then I am sure I should be a papist, and an enemy to the
Gospel. If you could prove that I have been a traitor, a murderer, a
drunkarde, a bearer of false witness, and maker of discord, an oppressor or
an extortioner or any such notorious malefactor (which I thank God you can
not) that should not daunte me neither make me once to shrink, but should
cause me rather to rejoice not that I had been such a sinner, but that God of
his goodness had called me, from being a favorer of vice to be a lover of
virtue, and from a servant of Satan, to be a child of God.

Saint Paul was not ashamed to tell openly yea more Acts. 22.
then once or twice, that he persecuted the saints of God then 1. Cor. 15.
which there can not be a greater offense: yet he did not rejoice Gal. 1.
therein, but in that God called him to the Gospel and that he was persecuted
as one of the saints of God, and therefore with Saint Paul I am not ashamed
what I have been, but I rejoice that God of his goodness has opened unto nice
the light of his gospel, so that neither slander, reproach, neither any thing
shall dismay me, for that I am made a member of Christ, and I say with S. Paul
when I mas a child I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I imagined as
a child, etc. But now through Gods grace and goodness, I am that I am. And if I
had bin never so evil, yet I may rejoice 1. Cor. 13.
to come from evil to be a professor of the gospel and the servant of God:
rather then you to shrink from the gospel (though you lived blameles in the
sight of the world) and now to become Jesuits reuolting from our savior to
satan, and from your prince to the pope.

The 39. part.
YOu say, that he seems to have bin some musition in (time, for that much of
his matter passes from him in time. 39. part.
You that can tell before hand what one would say: you are able quickly to
turn prose into time. It is a strange matter that you that perhaps have not
read my book through, can find that the most of my matter therein is rhyme,
when I that made it am most sure there is not one verse of rhyme in it. I think
you are as well skilde in prose as some of your popes was in grammar, either
you were in some pleasant dream when you wrote this, or you never read my said
book, or else surely you do not know prose from rhyme. I think you do take
latin verses to be english rhyme, and so you may have some rhyme to charge me
with all. I remember I wrote two verses of Baptista Mantuanus in my said book,
and that were these.

Viuere qui sancte cupitis, discedite Roma, Persuasion from papistry.
Omnia cum liceant, non licet esse bonum. If these latin verses be the ryme
you meant of, (for other page 111.
rhyme there is not in all the book) then I must needs confess that some part
of my matter is rhyme, but not much of my matter as you say, unless two lines
be much matter in forty sheets of paper, and then the sheets must be very
small, or else the two lines must be marvelous great. I think in deed much of
the meaning of my matter in the same book, is contained in the said two
latin verses: For all the Idolatry, blalphemie, pride, mischiefs and
errors, that I persuade you and all other from in that book, is committed and
practiced in Rome, and therefore the effect of much of my matter contained in
my said book, is comprehended in the said two latin verses, which belike
you took for Enlishe rhyme. And because I would have you to consider the same
well, I will now turn the same latin rhyme into plain english prose: which is
this that follows: All ye that would live godly, get you away from Rome: for
whereas all things there are lawful, it is not lawful to be good. This is
the prose of all the latin rhyme in my said book, for other english rhyme I am
sure there is none. If you mark this rhyme well, it shows that your holy city
of Rome, is more meet for Jesuits then for Christians. I think you pickte a
quarrel with me for the nouce to make me show you the rhyme of my book.
Because you would have me to praise your holy city of Rome, you have in your
discovery made great long discourses in commending ye godly customs and
charitable works of your city of Rome: but Baptista Mantuanus here in two
lines has extolde her out of measure.

Well, though you say that much of my matter in my said book is rhyme, and no
rhyme at all therein: yet your hole matter wherein you have (...) forth my
riming, is nothing but time. for these are your words, wishing the indifferent
reader to mark whether the same be rhyme or not. Of this autors estate and
calling I can not yet learn,

But that he seems to have bin some musition in time, for that much of his
matter passes from him in rhyme.

Though you would make men believe that my prose is rhyme: yet the indifferent
reader can not think, that your rhyme is prose. It is a great oversight in you
to say that much of my matter of forty sheets of paper is rhyme, and can not
prove that there is one verse of (...) in all ye hole book: which you have
affirmed only in two lines, and yet both the same lines are nothing but rhyme.

You would have me evil thought of for riming, though I rimed not at all: and
can you be well thought of that reprooueth me with nothing but rhyme:

It appears here by your learned and advised writing, that I have been a
musition because of my running: then I trust I am discharged from being a
musition because in my said book I have not rimed at all. Surely it seems
that you have a deep and mystical judgment in the finding out of the ground
and causes of things. I remember that before it showed plainly by your
argument, that the going of M. Nicols from Wales to England, from England to
Flaunders, from Flaunders to Rome, and from Rome to the pulpit in the tower of
London was the cause that he was borne at cowbridge in wales, as in ye same
place it may more plainly appear.

And as by your learning you found out that M. Nicols coming from Rome to the
pulpit in the tower of London was the cause he was borne at Cowbridge in Wales:
so by your deep knowledge, you have I perceive found out, that my riming is
the cause that I was a musition. For your own words show no less which are
these that follow.

He seems to have bin some Musition in time, for that much of his matter
passes from him in rhyme. Hereby it appears by your rhyme, that if I could not
have (...), I had never bin a (...). Therefore it (...) happy I (...) (...),
or else farewell all (...) and singing. But I would feign know of you whether
the cause is to be preferred before the effect or not, (...) is better then the
effect: the (...) cause I am sure you can not deny but that it is above the
effect, marie as for (...) causes, the effect sometime may excel the cause,
now if the cause be better then the effect, then a (...) is to be esteemed
above a musition: So that (...) be the cause of music, (which you (...)
before to be the cause that I have been a musition) and if the cause be to
be (...) before the effect, then a rymer is better than a musition. And so, a
common rymer is better thou the best singing (...) of the popes holy (...).
But they would not be well pleased with you, if they knew that by proouing
me a musition, you make them worse then the simplest (...) that is. And if the
cause which is riming, be not better then the effect, which is music: yet
do or say what you (...), the cause must needs be before the effect. So
that by your proouing me to be a musition because of my ryming: the rymer
must needs be before the (...). And so one can not be a musition unless he
be a rimer before.

But herein I think your argument will not hold, for I am sure there are and
have been, many excellent (...) that could ryme never a whitte and And many
also have been good rymers, and were but single (...) singers, and had no skill
at all in music.

Thus it is plain that many are (...) and no (...): and many are musitions and
(...) rimers. But by this your proving of me to be a musition, he that is a
musition must needs first be a (...), because you make riming to be the cause
of music, so that your argument must needs be false. Wherefore hereby (...)
does appear, if you had (...) me to ryme so much in my book (as I am sure
I rimed never (...) (...)) (...) I (...) be (...) in music for all that.

And now seeing (...) you have gone about to prove by my said book, that I
am a rymer: I do not think that you have made such a (...) lie to commend
me withal, who^ causeless you go about to discredit. Therefore it appears
yt you charged me with ryming to your simple Readers, (who you thought would
never read my book) thereby to make them think, that I that made the book,
had but small learning, because I had skill in ryming. But to have skill in
making of an english verse, makes not therefore to be unskillful in learning
and knowledge. I know there has been and is at this day, that were and are
excellent in making of English verses or meter, and yet notably well learned
both in the latin and greek tongues, yea and in diverse Sciences. Do you
think that they that wrote the Psalms of David into Euglish meter, were
therefore unlearned: Nay it is evident that they were well learned, and had
knowledge in the tongues, for the conference of the textes and concordance of
the words. But seeing (as I think) you much regard not the Psalms in
English prose, you less esteem the same in English meter. But though you
esteem not English meter, or decent ryming in English: yet you may perceive
(if you be so skilful in (...) as you seem) that king David the Prophet of
God, made Psalms in (...) verse, agreeing in proportion, number and syllables,
though not altogether in accent or sound. Now if ye prophet of (...) king David
(...) yt (...) in Hebrwe verse by the spirit of God: then why may not we
Christians, (...) good or godly things in (...) meter: Yea and translate these
(...) into english meter that David at the first made and wrote in (...) verses.

If you (...) our writers of English verses, then you seem thereby to
discommend them that wrote Greek and Latin verses, and then Homer the Greek
(...), and Virgill, and (...) excellent Poets and (...), with Ioannes Aurelius,
(...) and other, that wrote learned latin (...), are (...) beholden to you.
For, as you (...) make me an English rymer: so you account them as latin
rimers. But perhaps you will say, that they were not ry mers but (...), for
that their verses did not end in ryme as ours do. This will not serve your
turn, for though they did make their verses without meeter: yet diverse learned
men wrote their latin verses in latin meter. As Arnoldus de villa noua that
wrote thus of the (...) fire.

Primus formetur, vt sensus ei dominetur,
Sensibus equato, (...) (...) secundo,
Tertius excedit sed (...) tolleruntia ledtt,
Destructor sensus, nescit precedere (...).
Also Marculinus (...) thus,

Firmans mutatum, pregnatio spondet hiatum,
Quae been purgantur, concordipace ligantur.
An other writes thus,

Est fons illimis cuius latet (...) in imis, Carmina Geber. adscripta.

Euolat in primis, nisi clausis vndique rimis.
Therefore if you would have me disdained for ryming in English: then these
learned men are to be misliked for ryming in latin. But I trust you will not
disable me and other for our english riming, unless you mean thereby to
bring Pope Urban the 5. in discredit, that did send an Agnus dei unto the
Emperor with these ryming verses following), I may not say that the same
contain (...) and blasphemy: though they attribute that to the Agnus dei, that
only is due to the passion of Christ. And here follows the verses.

Fulgura desursum depellit, and omne malignum: It is in the popish Primer.

Peccatum frangit vt Christi sanguis, and angit:
Pregnans seruatur, simul and partus liberatur:
Dona defert dignis, virtutem destruit ignis:
Portatus munde, de fluctibus eruit vndae.
And now, if it were no discredit to Pope Vrbans (...). ning to set forth
these verses in latin ryme: then I hope it will not be a hinderance to my
learning to declare them in english meeter. Wherefore I will be so bold to
set forth the wonderful virtue of Pope Vrbans Agnus dei, whereby the (...) may
see, that the Popes Agnus deis can do as much in all points as the blood of
Christ, and here follows the virtue of Pope Vibans Agnus (...).

It puts away the furious force at need,
Of lightning and of every evil beside:
As Christ's own blood it breaks sin with speed:
It vexes feendes, they cannot it abide:
The woman great with child it does preserve,
And causes safe deliverance of the same:
It brings good gifts, to such as do (...):
It does destroy the power of fiery flame:
And such as were the same both clean and fair,
If they do chance in sourging waves to fall:
His virtue is such, they need not then despair,
It pulles them (...) and saues their life and all.
Saint John Baptist when he said Ecce Agnus (...), Behold the lamb of god, did
never speak of al these virtues of his Agnus dei. Surely many of you Jesuits
do never wear the Popes Agnus deis, or else they have no such virtue, as pope
Urban and many of you would make us believe, for if your Agnus deis can pull men
out of the water, and save them from drowning: then they may pluck men from
the (...) out of the (...) hand, and save them from hanging. So yt I muse that
Doctor Story, (...), Sherwood Ducket, and Campion with other (that had no
small devotion to the popes Agnus deis) would be without such a precious
jewel at the gallows, yt would work such wonders. But it may be they were so
weary of being the popes unfortunate servants: that they had rather be hanged
to be his happy Saints.

And I trust you will be no more offended with me for my riming in my said (...)
(where I (...) never a whit, the^ (...) Ioannes a Casa (...) of (...), yt was
Deane of pope (...) Chamber for his book in Italian Ryme, which is to be (...)
and abhord, for he wrote yt same most (...) in commendation of yt (...) and
(...) sin, which procured Gods wrath so much, yt therefore he destroyed Zodome
and Gomor with (...) and (...) from heaven: which vile and detestable book,
was printed at Venice by one Troianus Nauus. For if one of your Popes holy and
chaste Prelates may commend most detestable and wicked sins in Italian ryme,
then why should we be derided or evil thought of for writing good and
virtuous things in English meeter:

Therefore (all things before written well considered) honest ryming and
modest meeter is not so discommendable a thing as you would make it: Though to
my reproach untruly you went about to prove me a rymer. But by your proving
me a rymer I have proved my self none: though in your own two lines you have
showed your self a rymer, for all your words that you reproved me for ryming,
is nothing but ryme.

And whereas you would feign have proved me a Musition because of my ryming:
surely I cannot see for all your ryming that you have any great skill in
Music, for that it seems you are unskillful in the ground or causes of
Music, in that you count ryming to be the cause of Music.

Music may stand without ryming, better then (...) can stand without
Papistrie: for one may be a good (...) though he can ryme never a whit, but
one cannot be a Jesuit unless he be a Papist. If you had said thus, it
would have hanged a great deal better together.

It seems that the Gospel pure,
he earnestly does love,
For that the papists with the same,
he does so much reprove.
For, the reproving of Papistrie with the Gospel is a better cause that I love
the Gospel, then my ryming is a cause y^ I should be a musition. But now
though you have showed so slender a cause that I have been a Musition: I will
show you a better cause, yt you are scant a true subject. And this it is.

You Jesuits are no subjects true,
it may right well be seen:
For that you do obey the Pope,
and disobey your Queen.
This your refusing to obey the Queen, and to obey her enemy the Pope, is a
more likely cause that you are no true subjects: then my ryming (whereas I
rymed never a whic) was the cause that I have been a musition. If you had not
taught me to ryme by your ryming, I had not rymed here at this time: but for
that I am desirous to be a Musition, I am now the more willing to ryme,
whereby I hope shortly to be a Musition. For you being a profound and learned
Jesuit have taught me that riming is the cause of Music.

Whether you meant to disgrace me for being a rymer or a Musition I know not,
but seeing in derision you would prove me to be both: I think you would not
have me commended for either. And as you would have me disdained for ryming
which is your cause of Music: so you would have me despised for music
which is your effect of ryming. Yet there is no reason in it, for why should
you (...) Protestants more for being Musitions: then we disdain (...) for
being minstrels. If you were as reasonable as you are preposterous, you would
not disdain a man for his Music: but the Musition for his evil manners. Our
English musitions are as much beholden to you, as our English versifiers
are. But this I will say in the (...) of our musitions of England, I am sure
there are (...) honest musitions in England, then there are true and faithful
Jesuits to their Prince and Country, either in or out of England. Music
was wont to be counted a (...) and worthy science: and is it now become so
vile, that he that has knowledge in it should thereby be discredited: There
is a saying not so old as true, Scientia non habet inimicum praeter
ignorantem. Or thus, Tantum scientiae inimicus est ignorantia. The enemy of
science is only ignorance, which shows that your knowledge in music is not
great, because you envy the musition, and would have my book discredited
because of my music.

I never knew that it should be a reproach to any for having knowledge in
music: but many have been discommended for their unskillfulness in music.
In disdaining me for being a musition: you discommend thereby all musitions,
or that have knowledge therein, or apply themselves to the sludie thereof. But
though you go about to discredit my book by Jesuitical conjectures that I
have been a musition, yet I trust you will not discredit king David's book of
Psalms (the Psalter) though he was a musition, for he played excellently well
on the Harp, and did sing to ye same, which does argue that he was a musition,
and had skill in music. Your Priests have made fools believe that your holy
water would drive away spirits out of houses and men: But I am sure that king
David's music did ease 1. Kings. 16.
king Saul and thereby the evil spirit departed from him.

Now if you will have the Popes Priests to be esteemed and reverenced for
their casting of their holy water, which will not drive away Devils, but chase
away myse: (as one of your friends has affirmed) then musitions ought not (by
reason) to be had in such derision that are skillful in that famous science of
music, whereby the evil spirit departed from king Saul. You would make us
the worse because we know music: but your music is the worse because you
do know it. For David by our music drove a devil out of a man, but your
mystical music fills thousands full of Devils. It is said that Orpheus
had such excellent sweet and pleasant music, that with the melody of his
Harp he would make dead stones to dance, and seem to be alive: but your
Papisticall music, will make the living dead to Godwarde, yea and to die the
second death. And moreover it is feined by the poets that by y^ virtue of
music proserpina and the hellishe furies were brought out of hell into the
earth: but you Jesuits with your mournful music make the wise people of
the earth to be like furies, and do drive them into hell: King David being
the Prophet of God is as well to be credited as a Jesuit, who does not
contemn but commend, both music and musical instruments, (if he does so,
that does urge us to sing and to play on the same) for these are his words.
Rejoice in God O ye righteous: For praise becomes well the just. Confess it
to God with the Harp: sing Psalms unto him with the Vial and with the
instrument of ten stringes. Sing unto him a new song, make a sweet noise
with your musical instruments aloud. Psalm. 33.

Therefore it seems that you know not what music is, that would have it
to be a discredit to the party that knows it. I never read that Iesuitrie
should be one of the seven liberal sciences: But I am sure that Music is
one of the seven Sciences, yea and one of the four Mathematical Sciences,
which are, Arithmatike, Geometry, Astronomy, and Music, In which Sciences
and other, it may be, that I am not altogether ignorant, (though you go
about to discredit me as without all knowledge and learning.) For as you
confess, that as yet you have not learned my estate and calling: so I believe,
as yet you have not fully found out my knowledge and learning. And whereas you
geste that I was a musition because of my ryming, In deed I must confess, I
am not altogether ignorant in music, But if I were as ignorant in music, as
it seems you are in the cause of my music: I should then have no more
music, then there is truth in your religion. And now to put you out of
doubt, I had knowledge in music before I could ryme. Therefore you might
more (...) have said.

It seems that he has been some rymer in time:
Because he can sing, a thing meet for ryme.
Thus though you alleged that my ryming was the cause that I was a Musition:
I assure you that God is the cause that gave me wit and understanding to
learn music.

And for that you seem to discommend music, in that you disdained me for
having knowledge therein: I will something briefly speak in the commendation of
Music, whereby all wise men will esteem a man better for having knowledge in
music, then a Jesuit that has never so profound knowledge in papistrie.

Music is such a science of concordance and uniformity, that one may soon
understand when the musition does sing or play wrong. But when the Musition
perceives by the discordes or by the tune or sound, that he is wrong, will
he sing or play on still: No, he will begin again: And if his song be false
(...), he will never cease until he have found the fault, and then he will
amend it, whereby he will sing true. Yet you that are Jesuits (clean
contrary to the musition) will not try your Papisticall religion (which is
most false and far out of tune) by Gods word: as the muisition does his
song, by the right copy or by the science of music: but wilfully against all
godly harmony, do proceed still in your error most grievous to God, and
quite out of tune to the ear of the Godly Gospeller. Therefore I would to God
that you would try ye truth of your religion by Gods word: as the musition
will try his song by ye science of music. And now to speak in the
commendation of music, though you seem to disdame it: The truth is, in
musical harmony is such strength and virtue, that men's minds being fatigated
and weeried are thereby made yt stronger and more apt to study. Also shipmen
and mariners with artificers and other that labor (...), their singing makes
their painful labor seem the more easy, and the time to be shorter.
Music expels care, it comfort the sorrowful, and it deliteth men and
women so much, that extreme exercise in daunsing therewith three or four
hours together, will not tire them or make them feel wearines:

Whereas one half hour of easier exercise without music, would utterly
tire them. Music many times has warmed men's minds so much, that they have
felt no cold, though they stood an hour or two in the frost. When nothing
can cause a child to cease crying, a simple song will soon still it, and make
it merry, that before did mourn and weep. Yea music is of such force, that
birds are caught through the pleasure they have in melodious whistling. The
Elephantes of India are stayed with the musical sound of instruments. And
moreover as Alpharabius does testify, Alpharabius
music has moved horses in the wars to be curragious, and does
merueylously comfort the Dolphins and the Serens in the sea and other.

That great learned man Basil, seems to affirm that music is a mean (yea
and devised by the holy ghost) to fasten the fruit of godly doctrine in us,
and these are his words, For whereas the holy ghost perceived that mankind
was Basil, mag. in prolog. super Psalm.
hardly trained to virtue, and that we be very negligent in things concerning
true life in (...), by reason of our inclination to worldely pleasures and
delectations: what has he invented? he has mixed in his form of doctrine,
the delectation of music, to the intent that the commodity of the doctrine
might secretly steal into us, while our ears be touched with the
pleasantness of the melody. You would make that riming is the cause of
music: but hereby Saint Bafill, it appears that music is a cause of the
entering of godly doctrine into us. Now if this our earthly music does work
such effect, as was done by king David, and as I have now mentioned: then
what would the heavenly harmony of the Celestial spheres work if we might
hear it: whereof we are defrauded, partly through (...) (...) of the (...) of
our ears for the gross (...) ter. yt. (...) our hearing, but chiefly through
the great distance chere of from us or rather both. Yet some learned have bin
of this judgment that young infantes, smiling sweetly in their sleep (as many
of them do) at that instant do hear that sweat and (...) sphericall
harmony, which makes them so to rejoice and laugh. And thus this worthy and
commendable Science has done and does daily, that which none of the other
Sciences can do.

And as it being one of the four Mathematical Sciences does accord and agree
with arithmatike in perfection and true proportion of number, so it agrees
with Astronomy in time: yea and perfect musitions may well understand by
their singing, what time has passed in their singing, and how many minutes or
hours they have been a singing their songs. And if they have knowledge with all in Astronomy, they may know what sign and degree of the same, is
ascending, and in the culme of the 10. house, or full southe, and other places,
when they have ended their song: So that they know perfectly at whattime they
began their song. For as in every artificial hour is contained three score
minutes, and in every minute three score secondes, whereby there is in every
artificial hour 3. thousand and six hundredth seconds: So that according to
the direct ascentions, one degree does ascend in four minutes whereby it
falls out, yt 15. degrees does so ascend directly in one artificial hour
not differing much: even so one semebrefe of yt less perfect measure, (with is
now the most accustomed time with us of all songs) conteyneth the just time of
a second, whereby 60. se^breefes are a singing in one minute: so that according
to this measure, 3600. sembreefs, as a just hour a singing, and so the
Astronomical second, and the musical semebreefe, are just both of one time.
And thus by this famous science of music we may find out the merueylous
motions of the Celestial signs.

Mark further how the concords and discordes of this earthly Mathematical
science of music, does agree most aptly and wonderfully with the heavenly
science of Astronomy, in distance and quality with the aspectes of the
celestial planets. For as two notes being in one line or (...) on one string,
(So that the string have but one tune) is a perfect (...): in music called an
vniso^, or vnius soni of one sound: So ye co^iunctions especially of good or
friendly planets in one sign, is a good and a perfect agreement of the same
planets so (...). And as two planets being in the third sign one from another
and beholding one another, is a good and friendly aspect called a Sextile
aspect: So two notes distant in the third place or stringe, one from another,
is a good concord, and is called a third. And as two planets being in the
fourth sign one from another, and aspecting each other, is a quartile and an
evil aspect: So, two notes distant in the fourth place one from another, is a
discord called a fourth. And as two planets being in the fifte sign one from
another and beholding one another, is the best aspect of all other called a
trine aspect: So, two notes distant in the fifte place one from another, is the
best concord of al other, called a fifte. And as two planets being in the
seventh sign one from another, aspecting one another, is the worst aspect of
al other, called an opposite aspect: Even so two notes distant in the seventh
place one from another, is a merueilous discord in music called a seventh.

Here you may see how wonderfully our earthly music, being oue of the four
Mathematical sciences, does agree with heavenly astronomy, being also one of
ye four mathematical sciences. So that if you had been as profoundly seen in
this worthy science of music, as you are in your devilish doctrine of
papistrie, you would have sought some other way or mean to discredit me, than
by naming me a musition, or by my having knowledge in such a famous science.
Therefore I believe I shall win more credit by your calling me a musition,
then you will get honesty by being (...) Jesuit.

But it may be yt your drift was to dishonest me, by making your reader believe,
yt I was a musition and got my living by music, as though they that live by
music must needs be dishonest, or whatsoever they write is not worth the
reading.

I (...) you think better of your romish (...), (...) of our English (...).
But if Jesuits may esteem (...) musitions: surely a Christian may think well
of English musitions.

And if your musitions in Rome are to be commended, though they live by their
(...): then I cannot fee why our English (...) should be disdayned that live
honestly by the same. But to the intent you shall have (...) occasion to
disdain or disable me for my knowledge in Music, whereas I told you before
in certifiing you of my estate and calling, that I never had any spiritual
(...), (though you might suppose otherwise): now likewise to put you out of
doubt, (though I have some simple knowledge in Music) I profess not music,
neither do I get any living or any money by Music. (Notwithstanding better
and learneder, than I have done.)

The knowledge of Sciences was wont to make (...) to be esteemed: and shall
then the excellent Science of Music make me be disdayned: But suppose that
Music were not one of the four Mathematical Sciences and so excellent as it
is: should my knowledge therein work my discredit (...) my book therefore
be less counted of or esteemed: Saint Luke is though to have had skill in
paynting which is not comparable to the Science of Music: should therefore ye
gospel of Christ or yt acts of ye apostles which he wrote, be disdayned or
discommended, because a painter or one that had skill in painting wrote it:
Shall the Gospel of Christ be rejected which S. Matthewe wrote: because he
was a tolgetherer: which is not so deep a mystery as Music. Shall Paul's
epistles be discredited, because he being a tentmaker did write them? which is
not so learned a science as Music. Shall S. Peter's epistles be thought not
worth the reading, because they were made by a (...): which is not so hard to
learn as music. Now seeing neither saint Matthewe by his tolgethering,
neither S. Luke by his painting, nor S. Peter by his fishing, nor yet S. Paul
by his tentmaking, are the less esteemed, nor their (...) less embraced: then
why should my knowledge in the famous science of Music (which you rather
surmised then certainly knew) cause me either to be disdayned, or my book
diseredited: And seeing king David and the prophet of God, was not the less
honored for his knowledge in music and his playing on the harp, neither his
book which he wrote of the psalms, is therefore less liked: methinkes then
you should not go about to make me to be disdayned, or my book to be despised
by surmising me to be a musition, or because I have skill in music.

Therefore when you mean to discommende any hereafter, reprove rather his
wickedness then his writing, his lewdness than his learning, and his manners
then his music: unless he bestow his learning in lying, and his writing in
wresting of the truth, as you Jesuits do.

The 40. part.
THen after you come to a peece-of my preface, and have 40. part.
one snatch, at it, reciting my words not confuting the phrase, as though you
would have your reader to disdain my inditing, as you would have had them
mistike me for music, and these are your words. To the Disc. pa. 183.
great comfort and joy (as he hops) of her highness being framed by him not
troublingly by lovingly unto her subjects. And so you leave that matter and go
no further. As before you geste a wrong cause of my being a musition: so I
perceive you are ignorant of yt cause of my writing ye same in ye order. And
though it appear before ye you knew my thought and what I would have said:
yet here it is manifest, that you know not what I meant in writing of this. But
that you may understand that my words in this place are not so impertinent,
as you would have them import, I will show you the foundation wherefore I did
frame the^. The truth is, about ten years before I gave her majesty this my
book which you so much discommende, I with some pains and travel devised a
suite, for the great profit and commodity especially for the poor and needy
of this my native country of England, in most necessary places throughout
the whole realm, being a marvelous profit to thousands and hurt to none,
in the forefront whereof were these brief words written.

In dei gloriam: in Angliae Laudem:
In tuam O princeps vtilitatem
Maximamque perpetuam famam:
Commoditas multis, incommodum nullis.
Wherein I a Christian wished more good to this my country then ever any
Jesuit did perform I am sure. And as that suite was only to be granted by
her grace, for the profit of her subjects: so this my book that I gave her
majesty of late, was to be performed of her subjects to ye comfort and joy of
her grace. For I believe if her stubborn and disobedient subjects that obey
and favor the pope, would become obedient and obey her grace, as my chief
drift is in my said book, I think it would be no small comfort and joy to
her highness. And for that (the premises considered) it may more manifestly
appear that these my words (which you seem to disdain) are not so far out
of frame, nor so unaptly placed as you would have your reader to think: I
will here write the words in such order as I wrote them to her Majesty, (and
not out of order as you have done) which being advisedly read of the
indifferent reader (conferring the same with my former words) they may think
that you have not dealt very indifferently with me. And these are my words in
the beginning of my Epistle. As heretofore (my most gracious sovereign) I
troubled your highness (not without some travel to my self) in a thing that was
necessary, reasonable, and commodious to many and hurt to none: Even so I have
now (not troublingly but lovingly) framed an (...) (...) to such of your
subjects, as fear not God as they ought, regard not his word as they
should, nor obey your highness as they are bound, naming them English enemies
(as I may very well) for english friends I am sure they are not: which
persuasion is necessary, reasonable, and very profitable for them and not
hurtful to any. And as that which before I made to your Majesty, was by your
grace only to be authorized, for the great relief and succor of your
subjects: So this that I have now written to your subjects, is to be allowed
and practiced by them, to the great comfort and joy (I hope) of your highness.
And though I have pende it for them to perform: yet I have dedicated it to
your grace to peruse. etc. Hereby I trust the indifferent reader will judge
(the circumstance of the matter considered) that my said words are not so much
awry, as you would feign make your reader believe. And as hereby you go about
causeless to discommende me for placing of my words: so you go about to bleere
your readers eyes fraudulently, with displacing of my words, as the indifferent
reader may perceive, for these words, To the great comfort and joy (I hope) of
your highness, you have placed them before these words, not troublingly but
lovingly unto such of your subjects, which were behind them eight or niene
lines, besides you have of purpose left out the rest of my words between them,
and all to mar the se^ce of my saying, and to make my matter seem without
method.

If you were as honest as you would seem by your name, you would not thus
dishonestly have joined those my sentences so nie together, that I did place so
far a sunder: and to leave out such words as thereby the sense should be
hindered or hid to discredit me withal. You thought belike that either your
reader would never read my book, or that I should never read this your
book, or that I would not or could not, defend my doings against your
book. I would be loath you should take me with racking your writing or
displacing your words, as I have done you, no, you shall not find, in all
this my book, that I have left out any of your words of your sentences ye I
have written, or made any of your se^te^ces to leap so far out of their
places, no, I have written them truly as I found them, whereby the in different
reader may spy what difference there is between a true Christian and a false
Jesuit.

The 41. part.
THen after this these are your words that follow: 41. part.
This man's drift is (as he says) to prove all papists Discou. page. 183.
to be English enemies, and extreme enemies to England: which in effect he
proves thus: papists do love the Popes law, the Pope he loves not God
Almighties law: the Queens Majesty she loves God Almighties law, and her
law is all one with his: how then can the papists love their Queen and
country?

If you meant as truly as you mean falsely, you would have set down my
words as they are in my book: as I have written your words plainly as I
found them in your book: But because you seek my discredit you counterfeite
my words, In the beginning of with your counterfeate words, you affirm that I
say my drift is to prove all papists to be English enemies and extreme
enemies to England. If I have said so, why do you not show me where and in
what place I. said so? as well as I told you where you said a (...) from
dishonestie. If I have not said so, then why do you belie me? Methinkes it
should not stand with your holy profession, to charge me with an untruth.
Mark the title and beginning of my book, and you shall see whether you have
dealt plainly and truly with me or no. For these are my very words.

A persuasion from papistrie, written chiefly to the obstinate determined and
disobedient English papists, who are herein named and proved English enemies
and extreme enemies to England, etc. Here may you see your own corrupting of
my words and meaning, my drift is to prove, obstinate determined and
disobedient papists English enemies, and extreme enemies to England, which in
my said book, I have proved already, And not all papists: for I know there are
simple seduced english papists, ye you ye are deep and determined papists,
shall never I hope allure from the subjection of their Prince to the obediencie
of the Pope. In your said counterfeit words floutingly and mockingly you
affirm, (to allure your Reader to mislike me) that I should say thus, The
Pope he loves not God almighties law: The Queens Majesty she loves God
almighties law, etc. With which word (God almighty) you deride me, as
though I were a childish writer, or that I wrote some trifle or toy to please
babes withal. To discredit my writing, you have put in (God Almighty) more
then I wrote, whereby you have taken the holy name of God in vain. But if I
had upon good occasion written it, you would rather have plucked it out of my
writing, thereby to discredit me. Wherefore because you are such a subtle
shiftter and foyster in of words, I will here write mine own words that
they may (...) their own tale: whereby the indifferent Reader shall see
whether a Jesuit has dealt honestly with a Christian or not. And these are my
very words that follow, which cunningly you have counterfeited.

It is well known that the Pope is enemy to our queen, Persuasion from
papistry Page 4.
his laws are repugnant to her laws, and his religion is contrary to her
religion (which is the Gospel of Gods word) Now if any that is borne within
England, does earnestly love the Pope, then they can not faithfully love the
Queen, if any of them obey the Popes laws and decrees, they must needs
disobey the Queens laws and orders: and if they embrace and love the Popes
religion, then they must needs forsake and despise Gods word the Queens
religion. Now, for you that are (...), then you are rather the Popes loving
servants, then the Queens true subjects. And if you be not true and loving
subjects to our Queen, who under God is the chief staff and stay of the
peaceable and prosperous state of England: then you cannot be friends but
enemies to England, and thus I trow I have proved you English enemies.

These are my very words concerning the same, which you have rackt and
counterfeated contrary to my writing, whereby the indifferent reader may easily
judge, whether your words are my words in effect, and whether your writing
conclude as mine does, or not. In deed as you wrote it, it is a very simple
and childish argument, much like Peter Crabs arguments for proving of the Popes
power. True meaning would that you should write my arguments as they be, and
then to confute them if you can, but because you cannot, you curtall and piece
them at your pleasure, otherwise you confute them not. And when you have
brought them into such a pickle, the^ you commit them to your Reader to scanne,
who thinking you to deal plainly and truly, does therefore despise me, yea
and perhaps contemn my book before he read it or hear it. But therefore I
have written mine own words as they be, whereby the Reader may perceive that
though you are a Jesuit in name, yet you are more like a Judas in your dealing.

It is an easy kind of confuting, to write nothing but to (...) a man's words.
If I should have dealt so with you, you might justly have derided me, and
called me a liar without learning, as I may call you a learned falsifier and a
shameless Jesuit.

The 42. part.
AFter this you falsify my words again, and coin 42. part.
my writing with your own counterfeite stamp, much like one that when he has
once stolen, cares not then how often he plays the thief. Surely if you
meant honestly you would write my words as they be, and confute them after
(if you can) as I have done yours. It appears you are very shameless, and
either regard not your credit, or else you think, whatsoever a Jesuit does,
be ought not to be blamed, nor that any thing can work his discredit. Do
you think that your Readers are so childish and so simple to think that your
rehearsing of my words falsely, and curtalling them as it pleases you without
any other argument or proof, is a sufficient confuting of them? I think not.
I never heard of any that used this kind of confuting but you, and because you
are the first inuenter thereof, I believe you are the last that will use the
same. If to write nothing, but only to repeat falsely and untruly men's words
(as you do and have done) be a sufficient confuting: then we need no great
learning to the confuting of any. And now let us hear your cunning confutation
with nothing but with mine own wrested words, and thus they are as follows.

Again, the (...) cry upon their Queen Marie, Discovery. Page 183.
and we cry upon our Queen Elizabeth: And is not Queen Elizabeth I pray you
as well a kings daughter as Queen Mary? As well a kings sister as Queen Mary?
as lawful Queen of England (I will not say more) as Queen Mary? Why then
how can Papists be otherwise but English enemies, and extreme enemies to
England? These and the like arguments in sense though not altogether in the
same words, he dilateth according to his kind of eloquence, throughout all
the first part of his book, though he make no parts at all.

Where as you say it is my eloquence, I utterly refuse it, it is your eloquence
and none of mine. Seeing the words are yours and not mine: (as you have
confessed) then the eloquence shall be yours and not mine. You have written a
great sort of fine words and yt elo que^tly in this your discovery: and were
it reason that I should have the eloquence of them all from you? You are a
very kind and liberal man, that can be content to take such pain in
writing, and then to let me have all the eloquence that is due to ye same. You
have hackt, rackt, (...) and changed my words as you list, and have
vneloque^ted them, or taken the eloquence from them that they had: and now you
discommend me for my eloquence. You are like unto him that spightfully cut a
man's tongue out of his head, and then dispraisd him, because he could not
speak. Seeing you would ueedes dispraise my eloquence, it had been reason
that you should have recited mine own words as I wrote them: And then you
might Iawfully have discommended them for lack of eloquence. Therefore if the
words lack eloquence then you lack eloquence, (as it seems) because you
wrote them not eloquently, considering they are your words, and not mine, For
you have left out a great sort of mine and foysted in (out of all order) many
of your own.

And though I a Christian cannot be so eloquent as you that are a Jesuit, I
must be content with S. Paul, who though he were not very eloquent, by S.
Hieroms saying: yet the most eloquent Philosopher that ever was did never Number.
22.
so much as he, of whom S. Hierom writes thus: Paulus Hierom, in Psalm. 82.
qui soelecismos facit in loque^do, Christi crucem portat, etc. Paul that is
not able to utter his mind in congrue speech, bears the cross of Christ,
and takes all men prisoners, as if it were in triumph: from the Ocean unto the
red Sea, he subdued the whole world. and S. Paul himself says, though (...).
Cor. 11.
I be rude in speking, I am not so in knowledge. here, though Saint Paul lackt
eloqence, yet he lackt not the favor of God. Therefore I had rather lack
eloquence with S. Paul one of Christ's Apostles: then to be eloquent with you
though you are one of the Popes Jesuits.

In your said words which you have so falsified you count them my arguments
in sense though not altogether in words: but I marvel who gave you commission
to alter my words, and to put in other words for them, and to give my words
the sense of your forged words. If I should leave out your words, and put in
steed thereof what I think good of mine own, and to displace your words at
my pleasure, as you have done mine, and then to say, that it is the same in
sense though not altogether in the same words: you might well say then that I
(...) not done according to the profession (...) a Christian, though therein
you have done according to the profession of a Jesuit. Though you think the
Pope has authority to alter the scriptures, and to give them their sense as
he thinks good: yet I hope that you have no authority to alter and change
my words, and to give them their sense. But belike as you think the Pope may
alter the Scriptures as he list and give them what sense it pleases him: so
you being his Jesuit may likewise alter my words and give them what sense
you think good.

Before, when you dealt with the title of my book (which is A persuasion from
Papistrie) there you altered not my words, but wrote the^ as I wrote them,
because you thought yt persuasion being mine own word, would disgrace or
discredit me: But now, you perceiving that if you should write mine own
words as they be, they would not then serve your turn. Wherefore you
defaced and displaced my words, and foysted in your own to my reproach, and
to your own credit (as you thought.) But as coggers and foysters of false
Dyse thrive but sorily by their trade: so you by the chopping and changing of
my words and foysting in your own, will gain but little. And as they for
their cogging and foysting (when it is known) are so despised, that the honest
do shun them: so you, when this your subtle shifting is spied (for all you
are a Jesuit) will procure your own shame. Your Reader having any good
consideration, will not think but that my words hang better together then
you wrote them. But that your dishonest dealing may the better appear, and
that the indifferent and wise Reader may judge whether 'I wrote so fondly as
you have affirmed, I will here both write my very words that you so
shamefully altered, and also the occasion and the circumstance thereof. For in
this point I went about, not only to prove her (...) great mercy and Ienitie
to the obstinate Papists her disobedient subjects: But also, (though some of
the stubborn sort did so little consider her power, that they would say, that
she had no law to punish or execute them for the same) that she had as
great power and authority to make laws, and to punish them as Queen Mary
had. But all this you left out, besides the marring of my sentences and
arguments, that the reader might think, that it had neither good method nor
matter. And now here follows my words.

If he that counterfeateth the Queens Majesty's seal Persuasion from papistry
Page 7.
for some private profit (breaking thereby but one part of her laws) is a
Traitor and is therefore put to death: Then are not you that are obstinate and
disobedient Papists Traitors? And deserve death, that hate your prince
without any cause? and that withstand and disobey all her godly laws and
proceedings? In the loving and obeying of whom, and the keeping and observing
of whose laws and orders, her Graces safety, the preservation of her person,
the conservation of the common wealth, and the prosperous state of this Realm
does chieflye depend?

If hereby you will not willingly see what you are, I fear against your
wills you will feel hereafter what you are. Open your eyes therefore and see
what a merciful Queen you have, that ever since she began to reign has
rather mercifully without law sought to win you: then cruelly by law to
enforce or wound you. Think not because she suffers you, that therefore
she cannot punish nor execute you, which if some of you stick not to say
openly: many of you (I believe) think the same privily. Think not because
she has made no law for you, that therefore she can make no law for you:
for the Queens majesty has as great power to punish the Idolatrous Papists
in her Realm, as king Iosia had to burn the Priests of Baall in his Realm.
King Asa and his people made a covenant and swore not only to seek the Lord,
to cleave unto him, and to hearken vnhis voice, but also, that whosoever did
not so, should be slain, whether he were small or great, man or woman:
which covenant he performed and brake not, And is not our Princess queen of
England, as well as Asa was king of Judah? and has not she as great power in her
kingdom as he had in his? And if GOD was well pleased with king Asa for making
and perfourming of that covenant (as he was in deed): would he then be
angry think you, with Queen Elizabeth if she made the like and performed
it? I think not. But our merciful Queen (though she has set forth the
true (...) of God, as speedily, as earnestly, and as zealously as either king
Asa or any other rular, to be followed and observed throughout her whole
realm) has not made any such covenant or law to slay or kill them that do not
follow and obey the same.

But consider this well, if the Pope (not appointed by Gods law to reign and
rule as he has done) may murder and kill (as many of you think he may)
the professors and followers of Gods word (being not his subjects) for
disobeyiug his law devised and invented by man on earth, and procured by the
Devil: Then may not we think, that our Queen appointed by God and allowed
by his word to reign over us, may lawfully kill and put to death the
Idolatrous Papists her subjects, for wilfully disobeying and withstanding the
law of God that came from heaven, being long since taught by the Prophets, by
Jesus Christ the son of God and by his Apostles, moved and procured thereto
by God the holy Ghost? Therefore I beseech you weigh the mild nature of our
gracious Queen (the mother of mercy) that does not use the justice she may:
and mark your holy father the Pope (the captain of cruelty) that uses the
iniusticie he ought not.

I pray you, is not our Elizabeth Queen of England These are my very words
(...) be so altered and changed.
as well as Queen Mary was? Whatpower, what jurisdiction, what authority,
what superiority, what excellency, and what else had Queen Mary that this our
Queen Elizabeth has not? Queen Mary was king Henry the eights daughter, so
is our Queen Elizabeth: Queen Mary was King Edwardes sister, so is Queen
Elizabeth: Queen Mary succeeded her brother King Edward, so did Queen
Elizabeth succeed her sister Queen Mary: Queen Mary was lawefull Queen of
England, Queen Elizabeth is as lawful Queen of England (I will not say
more:) Queen Mary put down Gods word planted by her brother, and set up
Papistrie and Idolatry, and obeyed the Pope, Queen Elizabeth put down
papistrie and Idolatry planted by her sister, and obeyed GOD: Queen Mary used
her harmelesle and obedient subjects cruelly and put them to death that
professed gods word, Queen Elizabeth uses her wicked and disobedient
subjects mercifully, and suffers them to live, that profess and stiffly
defend papistrie and idolatry the doctrine of the Devil.

These comparisons duly considered, your Queen Mary did not much excel our
Queen Elizabeth (unless in cruelty and burning her harmless subjects). Now
if Queen Mary might put to death her humble and harmless subjects for
professing of Gods word: Then I cannot see but that our Queen Elizabeth, may
as well execute her stubborn and disobedient subjects (which she as yet
never did) that withstand Gods word, and will needs follow papistrie and
idolatry.

And further, if Queen Mary had a law to burn the servants of God, that
were obedient to her concerning their worldly duty, and never meant her harm:
Then why may not our Queen Elizabeth make a Law to execute the popes
servants (that are bound to be her loving subjects) which are disobedient
unto her, and that seek, procure, desire and wish her death and destruction?

Therefore be thankful to God that has given you and us such a merciful
prince to reign over us, and love and obey her, that gives you for justice
mercy, and for extremity lenity. And now as her grace does refrain from
that she may do: so provoke not her (...) to that she can do. And as I
said, think not that her grace can not use the sword against you, because
she has not used it: for if you think so, you do not only deceive your
selves, but also do much abuse her Majesty, in that you seem thereby to make
her a Prince without power: whereby you are unworthy of the great mercy she
shows unto you.

What servant is so foolish to think (much more to say) that because his
master does not beat him for his fault, therefore he can not beat him?
Because the merciful father does not beat his son for his offense, that
makes not that he can not beat him for the same. Shall her clemency and
mercy make you think in her disabilitie? Therefore if any of you think so
(as I believe some of you have said so, you are not worthy of such a merciful
mistres that uses you so.

Thus far have I written to this end in my said book, whereby it appears
most manifestly, that my drift was altogether to she we forth her Majesty's
great lenity and mercy: And that she has as great power and authority as
Q. Marie had, to make laws, and to use the swoorde with severity and justice
as well as she: as appears by the whole circumstaunce of the matter both
before and after: which you of purpose did not only leave out, but also did so
choppe and change my words to discredit me withal: that they had neither
good sentence nor sense. And this is the very cause and ground why I wrote
the said words that you (...) unhonestly altered.

And though you mislike my eloquence, yet I hope the indifferent reader will
not think yt these my arguments are so fond and senseless, and so disorderly
couched, as you would have made them believe by your wrested and altered words.
If they mark but your words that you wrote in stead of mine, and confer
my comparison between Queen Marie and her Majesty, with your words: they
may soon see your malicious meaning. For where you have written, The papists
cry upon their Queen Marie and we cry upon our Queen Elizabeth, I have no
such words at all. And morouer, within six of your lines after, you have
fathered these words upon me, Why then, how can papists be otherwise but
English enemies and extreme enemies to England? If I have any such sentence
or words I will yield unto you and be one of the popes Jesuits, which to
be I would be loath.

You might have thought me to be a very dolt, if I should go about to prove
papists to be english enemies, because the Queens majesty was a kings
daughter, and a kings sister.

You your self are so cunning in finding out of such mystical causes, that I
am not able to compare with you therein: for first you made that M. Nicols
going from Wales to England, and from thence to Flaunders, and so to Rome, and
from Rome to the pulpit in the Tower of London, was the cause that he was borne
at Combridge in Wales. Then after you would seem to prove that I was a
musition because I was a rimer, and now thirdely (because you would have me
to be a citer of your causes) you would make your reader believe that I prove
that papists must needs be extreme enemies to england, because the Queens
Majesty was king Henry's daughter and king Edwards sister. But truly, you are
tried before to be so cunning and expert in finding out of the causes of
things, that this deep profound cause ye is alleged for the proving of
papists to be extreme enemies to england, is of your own invention: for they
know that my wit is to weak and my learning to light, to find out such a
mystical cause. It had been enough for Peter (...) to have (...) this argument
(the prouer of the popes power) that said, because Peter paid the tribute
money for Christ and Council. (...). 1 page. 10.
himself, therefore the pope has authority over the whole Church of God. And
because Christ said to Peter, follow thou me, and again launche forth in the
deep, and because Peter drew his sword and cut off Malcas ear, therefore the
pope has authority of the whole Church of God.

This had been a fitter argument for him then for me. Also this argument had
been more meet for pope Innocent, than for me, which would prove that the
Moon being inferior De Mayor. (...) obedien. vna^ Sanct am. in Sexto.
to the Sun, therefore the Emperor was inferior to the Pope: And that the
Emperoute is a thousand fold inferior to him, because God has made two
lights in heaven. (Which is the Sun and the Moon). These and such like
arguments are more meet for Popes then Protestants. And now for that you
Jesuits are sworn to the pope, Therefore this argument, (that papists are
English enemies and extreme enemies to England, because Queen Elizabeth is
as well a kings daughter and a kings sister as Q. Marie:) is a more (...)
argument for a Jesuit then for a (...).

If the indifferent reader consider mine own words before written, he can spy
no such thing as you charge me withal, But may (...) perceive, that I wrote
the same only to prove that yt Queens majesty has as great power to use ye
sword, and to make laws against her obstinate and disobedient subjects, as
Queen Mary had. And that it is as lawful for her grace to punish and execute
her obstinate and disobedient subjects: as for Queen Marie to punish and
execute her loving and harmless subjects (the professors of the Gospel) that
obey her with due obedience.

Therefore it is no great matter for you to prove that I am neither eloquent
nor learned, if you may chop and change my words, and foist in your own at your
pleasure as you have done.

Tullie was an eloquent writer, yet if I should chop and change his works and
writings, putting in and leaving out what I list in the same, I could make him
seem quickly to have but small eloquence.

Plato and Aristotle were learned Philosophers: yet I could make them seem
unlearned, if I should use their books as I thought good.

Salamon was the wisest man that ever was (except Christ) whose words if I
should back and choppe, thrust in and pull out what I list, (as you have
done) I could make him see me to be no very wise writer. And as it is no
great matter for you to say and prove, that a man can not go when before you
have cut off his legs: So it is a very easy thing for you to make your
reader (...) that I have neither eloquence, learning, nor wit, when you have
curtald my writing, and have (...) out and foysted in what it pleases you. We
must think this honest dealing, because a Jusuite has done it, but if a
Christian had done so, you would have called it impudency the mother of
desperation. But if mine own words would have proved me so vneloquent as you
would make me, and that the same had been so without sense as you would
feign have had them: I am out of doubt that then you would have written mine
own words as they were. But for that you thought they were too true to serve
your turn: Therefore (to discredit me) you displace and deface mine, and
trust in your own as though they were mine. But though mine eloquence be small,
yet I trust the indifferent reader (when he has thoroughly vewed my words,
and likewise weyed yours) will as well judge that my matter has some method
and my sentences some sense, as you by corrupting them would have made the^
both without method and sense.

If the first part of my book (as you say) be nothing but such arguments as
you before have written for mine: the reader had a good occasion rather to
rende the whole book than to read the rest: But they that shall think good
to read the rest of the first part of my said book, what the arguments are,
I will leave it to their consideration, trusting that the matter thereof is
more meet to be market then to be mocked.

The 42. part.
Where as you say I have made no first part of 43. part.
my said book at all, yet there are such distinctions of every matter as I
thought sufficient. But if you had been nie me (if you had had a name as you
have not) I would have come to you that you might have taught me how to have
parted my book.

But now because you are namelesse, it may beseem my book as well to be
without parts as you to be without a name. And if it be lawefull for you to
make a book without putting your name unto it: then it is as lawefull for me
to make a book without putting your parts unto it.

Perhaps you would have had me divide my book into chapters, I am sorry I
did not, if you therefore would have liked it the better. Yet for all the Bible
is in chapters, you have not the greater devotion unto it, but though ye Bible
is now divided into parts and chapters: it is hard for you to prove that the
books of the same were at the first writing in chapters as they be now. For
Christ when he alleged any text out of Moses or the Prophets: yet he never
mentioned any part or chapter where it was, neither did S. Paul nor any other
of the Apostles. Notwithstanding when I am thoroughly persuaded that the books
in the Bible, when they were first written, were divided in such parts and
chapters as they be now: (...) (to pleasure you withal) I will divide my
said book into such chapters and parts. But until then, I (...) desire you
to be content with my distinctions. And now for that I did not part my said
book as I should have done, (wherein I was foully ouerseen) therefore I have
divided this book into parts to please you (...).

The 44. part.
THen you go further with me and do say as follows, 44. part.
In the second part, he wandreth by certain controversies, but as without
all wit and learning like an English doctoure, citing all his matter out of
lewels defense of Apology, Foxes martyrologe, and Cowpers Epitomie of the
Cronicle: so without all (...) or limitation of lying.

It is not for a Christian I perceive, to compare in wit and learning with a
Jesutte. You have so much that I must needs have the less, but for that small
portion of wit and learning that I have, I thank my heavenly father for it.
What I have therein, I have received: And he that gave Salamon his wisdom, is
able to (...) mine. I rejoice that I know Christ, for that is wit and
learning enough for me. And though you may excel me in wit and learning:
yet the more you corrupt men's writings and (...) their words, the less will
your wit and learning be esteemed, especially with the godly and wise.

All is (...) wit or wisdom that you call so: and all (...) not foolishnes
that you account foolishness, your earthly wisdom is heavenly folly. And
Saint Paul says the wisdom (...). (...). 3.
of this world is foolishnes with God. Then contrary I may say, that many take
Gods wisdom to be mere foolishness. (I pray God that you be not one of
them) And therefore though you say that I wander in the second part of my
said book without all wit and learning: I wandered so as it pleased God to
direct me. For though my learning (as I must needs confess) is but small,
yet my prompcer in the making of that book, had learning enough for us both.
For God (I am most sure) was my director, and the holy ghost was my instructor.
For if the holy ghost will instrucc the godly in their speech that are
witnesses of the Gospel: then I am sure he will instruct and guide their
pens that take his cause in hand, and do write against his enemies in the
defense of his word. And if a Matthew. 10.
Sparrowe light not on the ground without Gods providence: then I am most
certain that I wrote that my book (which is a greater matter then a sparrows
lighting on the the ground) not without the providence and help of God.

And if my learning be small, or if I be without wit or learning, then it
is the more shame for you to profess and maynteyne such a religion as an
unlearned man is able to disprove. Which I am sure I have done through the help
of God, by the scriptures, Ancient doctors and natural reason in my said
book, as the godly and indifferent reader may easily judge. Though you
discommende and discredit it is as much as you may. But I am most sure (which
before God I speak unfeignedly) the profoundest papist and the learnedest
Jesuit of you all, shall never be able to confute or convince it: unless you
confute it with burning of it, or killing of me. Which are your chiefest
arguments to confute withal.

If you had as much wisdom as you pretend to have learning, you could not
have been taken tardie and in such trippes as I have taken you. Therefore
brag not toomuch of your wit and learning, for the weak you see many times
do confound the learned and witty. If the cause you wade in were as true as
it is false, you should with less learning then I think you have: get a
great deal more credit by writing than you do.

But if you had ten times more learning then you have, and my wit and
learning were less then it is: (having the truth on my side) I would not
fear to confound you. For seeing a brute beast and an Ass did reprove the
prophet Number: 22.
of God: Then I (a member of Christ) doubt not but to confute one of the Popes
Jesuits.

The 45. part.
IT pleases you in derision to liken me to an English Doctor, well, I had
rather be an English Doctor 45. part.
then a latin doulte, an English protestant than a latin papist, and an
English Christian than a latin Jesuit. And I had a great deal rather go to
heaven to know the Gospel in English, then go to hell to know the popes
law in latin. Is learning any thing else but, intellectio and come moratio
praelectorum seu auditorum? What was the deep learning of Plato, Socrates, and
Aristotle, and of all the other heathen Philosophers without knowledge of
Christ: they had been better to have bin unlearned cobblers, and to have known
Christ's Gospel in their mother tongue without any other learning: then to
have been so profoundely learned without Christ as they were. Unless one be
profoundely learned you make noe accoumpt of him: but how so ever you count
learning, I am sure that godly knowledge, not curious cunning, and the truth
not the tongue, will guide us to heaven.

Yet if you go to learning, there are a great sort of wise and learned
doctors in this realm that are able to teach and turn your Romish
doctors, especially in true knowledge and learning: but be like you think our
English doctors are unlearned, else you would not compare me that am
without all wit and learning to an English doctoure. They are very much
beholden to you, for hereby you go about, to make them either no Englishemen:
or else to be without all wit and learning. But as it is too much for you to
prove, so I am sure it will be hard for you to prove them no Englishemen.
For though you can be content to forsake your Prince and your Country for
the pope, and so of a true Englishman, to become a false Romaniste: yet they I
am sure will stick to their Prince and continue in their Country, detesting
the Pope and his practices.

But though you turn from your prince and country, yet you can not turn your
self from being an English man, for though you may change your conditions,
yet your native country can not be changed. Therefore every doctor that is
borne in England must needs be an English doctor: though he be never so
learned. So that contrary to your former tale, you affirm me unawares to be
both wise and well learned, as our Doctors of England are: or else our Doctors
of England, or English Doctors to be without all wit and learning as I am.
But to suffer a small inconvenience by avoiding a greater mischief, you were
best to allow me some wit and learning: least by your doom, all our Doctors
in England have neither wit nor learning. Therefore now it stands at your
courtesy, whether you will be a liar to make them all learned: or to tell
truth and make them all fools.

Truly you being a Jesuit write very unadvisedly and preposterously, for you
call me a Doctor and yet you say I am unlearned, that is, indoctus. We
Christians do use to have men docti, learned, before we make them Doctores,
that is teachers: but you Jesuits can make men Doctores, teachers, before they
be docti, or learned. Belike you had this power of Pope John the 13. For as
he made Boys Bishops for money and Deacons in a stable before they had wit:
so you have made me a Doctor before I have learning. But though you have made
me a doctor without learning, yet upon your bare word I dare not adventure to
be a Doctor or teacher before I be learned: So that as one that would feign
learn, I will content my self with the name of a simple scholar, giving my
title of a Doctor to you that are so profoundly learned. Yet sor all your great
wit and deep learning, if you have all the wisdom and learning of the world
without the Gospel of Christ, you have nothing: and if we have none other
learning but the Gospel, we have learning enough. For if the best learning
the Prophets of God had was, thus says the Lord: then what better learning
can we Christians have, then thus says Christ. Therefore though you Jesuits
do brag and boast of your great knowledge and learning, yet we Christians
can rejoice in nothing, but in Christ and in the knowledge of his Gospel:
well assured that the small learning of a Christian, shall be able to convince
the great and profounde learning of a Jesuit. For if simple fisher men
unlearned were able to confound the beepe Doctors and the profounde learned
Jews by the Gospel: then I (though I have but small learning) make no great
account to consute you Jesuits with the same Gospel of Christ, for all your
profounde wit, knowledge, and learning.

These people are the most blessed that have the greatest faith, not the most
learning: Wherefore if I hear and follow Gods word, I care not though you
disdain me for want of learning, for my want of learning, cannot be so great
a reproach to me before men: as your want of yt true knowledge of the Gospel
and perfect faith in Christ, is before God. Therefore you have not so great a
cause to discommende or deride me for want of wit and learning: as I have
cause to lament you for want of true knowledge in yt Gospel and perfect faith
in Christ. God accepts faith more then learning, though you regard learning
more then faith. Christ marueiled at the Centurio^s faith, not at his learning
(whose servant he healed) and said to him go thy way, and as thou beleeuest
so be it unto Math. 8
thee. he said not, according to thy learning so be it unto thee. Christ
also said to the woman that was healed when she touched his garment, daughter
thy faith has Mark. 5.
made the whole, he did not say thy learning has made thee whole. Christ
rebuked his Apostles and other diverse times, saying, O ye of little faith, but
he never disdained nor Math. 6.
disco^me^ded the^ for lack of learning, neither said he to the^, O ye of
little learning. But if Christ's Disciples or they that Mark. 3.
belonged to him, did think he was mad: then it is no great marvel though
you that know me not, and hate my religion, do say that I am without all wit
and learning. And though I am without all wit and learning, I comfort my self
with the saying of David, which is: The law of God is perfect, converting the
soul, the testimony of God is sure, and gives wisdom unto the simple.
Psalm. 19. And as you deride and disconunend me for want of wit and learning:
so in the beginning of your said discovery where you discomme^d M. Nicols for
writing of Hebrwe and Greek in (...) latin Epistle to that worthy good and
zealous (...) Sir Owen Hopton, you seem to disable the said knights knowledge
in the latin tongue, in saying that he was overmuch troubled with the latin
before. Whatsoever his knowledge is in the Latin tongue I know not: but his
Christian faith exceeds your Iesuitic all learning. For as the Centurion
(being captain of an hundred soldiers before Math. 8.
mentioned) and Cornelius the Captain to whom S. Acts. 10.
Peter was sent, were more accepted of God for their faith (though they were
not deeply learned) the^ the proud, learned Scribes, Pharisees, and high
Priests: So this worthy and zealous knight sir Owen Hopton, being the Queens
Majesty's Liefetenant, and chief captain of the Tower, and of all her
Majesty's servants and soldiers there (though he be not so deeply learned as
you) yet for his zealous mind, his earnest love to Gods word, and for his
perfect faith in Christ: is no doubt therefore more accepted of God, then you
that cast of Gods word and cleave to your own wit and learning. And for that
you say that he was overmuch troubled with latin, it is like you thought he
had but small knowledge in Hebrwe and Greek. But for his wanting of those two
tongues, in my judgment he is not the less to be esteemed, if the Popes
were not worse to be thought of for wanting of Latin: for if your Spiritual
Popes that had all laws in their bosoms, and an heavenly or divine judgment
in their breasts wanted Latin and Grammar as is before proved: Then sir Owen
Hopton being but a temporal knight and the Queens Lieftenant of the Tower,
may well lack both Heinwe and Greek. And thus though you seem to deride me
for want of (...) and learning: yet I wish with all my heart that Christ do
not despise you at the last and dreedefull day for lack of faith.

The 46. part.
YOu say that I cite all my whole matter out of Jewels 46. part.
defense of the Apology, Fox his Martyrologe, and Cowper Epitome of the
Chronicle. As good, as wise, as godly and learned as you would have named
these three worthy and learned men with more reverence then you have done:
being three such special and painful learned writers for the commodity of
their Country, and for the perpetual profit of our posterity, as neither
your great city of Rome, nor yet the whole Country of Italy have bread or
brought forth at any one time three such, as this our Country of England
has done of them, at least so manifestly known by their works, as they are
by their writings.

We Christians here in England do knowledge our selves greatly bound to
God for them and such like: though you Jesuits do make small account of them.

I had been a very unskillful writer if I had not written in the same part of
my book, one sentence of mine own but all of other men's doings, (seeing it
was one of the three parts of forty sheets of Paper). But as al your words
before, have not been Gospel, so here you have spoken more than truth. But if
you were as loath to speak that is false, as it seems you are careless (...)
you speak: you would I am sure have said, that some part of the same was none
of theirs.

Whether all my matter of that part of my said book be cited out of master
Jewel, master Cowpers and master Foxes books, I will refer the same to the
indifferent reader thereof. And if they say that I have cited all the matter
therein contained out of the said learned men's books, I will become a (...),
so that you, if they say contrary will become a Christian.

But as many arguments, similitudes, and sentences of the same was of mine own
devising through Gods help: so there are other learned authorities that I had
never of them. But suppose that I had taken all my authors for my purpose out
of them (being the authors words and truly alleged) should that be a
discredit to my (...) must every book be counted unlearned and of no value,
unless every sentence of Saint Augustine, Chrysostom, or other learned
fathers, doctors or writers, that is (...) therein, be taken out of the
authors work that first wrote them? Then many of your Papisticall pamphlets
that you esteem and extol must not go for (...). Can you make me believe
that every author cited by you, is taken out of the original work? I scantly
think it. I doubt not but that some of you do credit your friends quoting
sometime without further search. What if I should allege out of the Gospel
of Saint Matthewe these words of Esaias spoken by Christ, which rightly may be
applied unto you, With the ears ye shall hear and Math. 15
shall not understand, and with the eyes ye shall see and Esai. 6
shall not perceive, etc. Or these words of Esaias out of Saint Marks Gospel,
This people honoreth me with Mark. 7
their lips, but their hearts are far from me: Will Esai. 29
you not credit Christ the citer hereof? Or will you jest at the work
because I took the^ not out of the book of the Prophecy of Esaias? May not a
man upon the credit of Saint Paul recite upon some occasion, some of his
(...) of the Prophets or other Scriptures that he cites in his Epistles? Or
shall the book be disdained or discredited, because the writer of the book,
took not the same out of the Prophet that spoke them? Or out of his book that
first wrote them? They that therefore will mislike a book are rather precise
papists then perfect Protestants.

If I should make a good and precious medicine, would you dispraise or despise
that good and precious medicine or think scorn of it, because the herbs yt
made it was not gathered in the garden beyond the Sea, from whence the Seeds
or herbs were first brought: If you were so curious you were not worthy to be
cured of your disease. And if such curiosity were used, many one would be
dead before the medicine were made. It makes no matter how nigh or where the
herbs be gathered, so that they be ye right herbs, and have the very virtue.
And so if we produce learned men's sayings for testimony, and make therewith a
spiritual confection for the health of the soul: it forces not out of what
book we cite them, so that they be the right words and the true sense of
the first Author. Therefore though I had cited all my matter out of master
Jewels, master Foxes, and master Cowpers books, (as I have not) so that they
be apt and fit for my purpose, being the very true words, of the first and
original author thereof: you had neither therefore cause to discredit my
book, neither the indifferent Reader to mislike my book.

Perhaps you disdain or mislike it, because I have cited in some points
master Jewel, master Cowper, and master Fox for authority, seeing they are
yet alive or were but late writers: and therefore you think them unworthy to
be cited as authors. Surely if you think so, as I believe both you and many
other do so: then I take your opinion therein to be rather preposterous then
profound, and reproueable then reasonable. For if in worldly affairs,
witnesses are thought best when they be living: shall witnesses then be thought
best in heavenly causes when they be dead? Antiquity is no credit to an
cuill writer, neither late years can be any discredit to a good writer. Time
ought not to be preferred before truth, but truth before time. Christ's and his
Apostles words were as true and good fifteen hundredth years since as they be
now: Therefore the long continuance of the time since, makes not their words
the truer, or their authority the better. So that if a man's words or writings
are worthy to be alleged for authority a thousand years after he is
dead: then they may be alleged in his life time, or soon after his death.
Wherefore if master Jewel late Bishop of (...), (...) the reverend and
learned Doctor Cowper now Bishop of Lincolu, and the godly, zealous, and
learned master Fox, have written wisely, faithfully and truly, (as most
assuredly they have done, whose worthy works you may well disprayse, but
never confound or confute) then they deserve now as well to be alleged for
authorities, as though they had written them a thousand year since. And to
tell you truly, these their learned works procured me to produce them for
witnesses and to quote their sayings in my said book, the rather thereby to
allure mo to esteem their writings and to read their said books. So that if
you consider all things well, you ought neither to disdain nor discredit my
book, for alleging authorities out of master Jewel, Doctor Cowper and
master Fox, who were and are famous, godly, and learned writers.

The 47. part.
AS you say, I do it, without all modesty or limitation 47. (...).
of lying, whether I do lie without all modesty, it is very manifest that you
have falsified my words with no great modesty. And as my lies are without
limitation, so they are without number, for that you are not able to prove me
so much as with one lie: for if you could your Reader should have been sure
to have heard of it. But whereas you say, without any further proof, that I
lie without limitation, I have plainly proved before, that you have lied with
limitation, and so your lies are limited and mine unlimited. My lies are so
far hence, and that is because they are without limitation, that you cannot
find them: but your lies are so nigh hand (because they are within limitation)
that I quickly spied them. Well, though to my remembrance I have not made any
(...) lie in all my said book, yet I must needs confess that I made a very
foul oversight in taking one syllable in steed of another, which was in the
intitling of my book, naming it a persuasion in steed of a disuasion. But for
your just reproouing me therein, I have I trust sufficiently set forth mine
own negligence with the due commendation of your intelligence: not doubting
but that your gentle instruction shall be a sufficient warning for me ever
hereafter, for using persuasio^ in steed of disuasion.

When you shall chance to make any more lies, you were best let them be made
without limitation, as mine were: and then it will be hard to find them, for
yours were limited within such a small compass, that they were espied and
caught at the first.

The 48. part.
THen after you come to show my lies, but it had been 48. part.
better for you I think, not to have uttered them, for surely they will rather
shame your self, then credit your cause. And these are your words that
follow.

For he says that the Papists hold: Page 99.

That they print him in their books, our Persuasion.

That the Pope also acknowledges the thing, taking himself in deed to be a
God: Page 98.
That he dispenses both against the old and new testament: Luptons lies.
Page 172.
That he bids us not to forbear swearing any day: Page 193.
That he allows all priests to have harlots: Page 131.
That he gives license for money to keep as many concubines as a man will:
Page 171.
That his fast is, to cramme in as many banqueting dishes as men can: Page 5. 6
That all papists are worse and deserve more death, then drunkards, thieves,
murderers and Pirates. This is Luptons charitable doctrine, with many things
more which I omit.

You have gathered diverse of my words written in sundry places, and couched
them altogether at your pleasure here in one place. And you have further more
cut and curtalde them far otherwise then I wrote them: whereby you have
marred my method, and drowned my sense, making my words to hang together as
feathers do in the wind, and all to discredit my book. Thus you do not
only deface and falsify my words, but also you fetch them out of their due
places where I did set them, and do place them in such crooked corners, that
they neither reprove falsehood, nor yet defend truth. And when you have done
so, you neither confute nor reprove them, unless you do it with these words:

This is Luptons charitable doctrine, with many things more which I omit, or
else perhaps your words in the margent (which is Luptons lies) have confuted
them.

If I should have gone about to confute you only with false repeating and
unorderly displacing of your words, without any more a do: then I had not
taken half the pains I have done. I have not dealt thus with you as the
indifferent reader may judge: for I have not left out one word of yours,
neither have I added any words to yours, nor yet have I displaced any words
of yours. But you when you have falsified my words, you leave them at randon,
committing the confuting thereof to your reader: whose misliking thereof (who
can not well like them as you have used them) is all the confuting that you
desire.

If you did love the doctrine of Jesus as well inwardly, as hypocritically you
profess his name outwardely: you would deal plainly and truly as Jesus
did. But because you deal fraudulently and falsely, you are rather of the
feloshippe of Judas than of Jesus. Yet for all your falsifiyng of my words,
suppose that I had written the self same words before mentioned, (...) had
placed them even in such order as you have done: you seem by your silence
without further reproouing or confuting them, that they are true. For if they
had been false, why have you not particularly declared how and in what sort
they are false, as I have done yours? Truly, if they had been lies as they
are not, you would have certified your reader wherein I had lied. For you that
would discredit me for mistaking of a syllable: (as you thought) no doubt you
would have proved me a lier in all this if you could.

At the first beginning of which your falsified words, you affirm that I
say, that the papists hold, the pope to be very God. etc.

If you had meant as truly, as here you (...) fasely: you would not have
fathered those words on me that I wrote not. For I have not said, that the
papists hold the pope to be very God. etc. For I am assured that a great
sort that favor the popes religion do not believe or hold, nay, rather that
none at all do hold, the pope to be very God.

(Hoping there are few so fond, or any so mad, and yet a great sort are
fond and mad enough) And now that the indifferent reader may perceive your
crafty iugling. and how you have foisted in your own words in stead of mine:
here will describe mine own words that they may answer for themselves. And
for that you have displaced my words, besides your adding too much in some
place, and saying too little in an other place: I will set them now again
among their own fellows. And these they are that follow. Pers. from papistry

whether the pope be God or not. (I said not that the papists hold the Pope to
be very god, as you have misreported me) And one said thus presently before
his face in the Council of Laterane without rebuke.

Lions in the year of our Lord 1555. (which is not past xxvi. or xxvii. years
since) It had been better you had not recited these words, for thereby you are
proved to have falsified my words, and that your pope was called another God
on the earth. And that he was published our Lord God the pope in a book
printed not long since. Which if it be not to much for any earthly man to take
upon him: let the indifferent reader be judge.

You (...) seem to jest out the matter with reciting my words falsely, as
though it were sufficient for your reader to think they were Luptons lies
because you have written (...) lies in your margent, without any other
reproouing or confuting. But howesoeuer you (...) me to lie, it appears
manifestly by the Popes Canonistes, (as is before written) that the pope may
dispense against the law of God, against the law of nature, against Saint
Paul the Apostle, against the New Testament, and against all the
commandments both of the old and new Testament. All which dispensations you
have clean left (...), except the last, and yet you have falsified the same in
two points: for whereas I said The Popes Cannonists say that the pope may
dispe^ce, you said that I say he dispenses: And whereas I said the Popes
Canonistes say that the Pope may dispense with all the commandments both of
the old and new Testament, You affirm that I say, he dispenses both against
the old and new Testament.

Whereby you would feign prove me a liar, for if this pope that is now does
not dispense both against the old and new Testament, I should have lied if I
had said so. So that hereby you show your self to deal falsely and mean
crafcely. But if there were no more but that that you write, and if it were
none otherwise but even as you have written: yet you have not confuted my
words, nor proved me a liar: but rather affirm them by holding your peace for
quitacet consentire videtur.

The pope that takes upon him to dispense with all these (though he were not
called our Lord God the pope as he has been) makes him self more like a
God then a man.

Christ the Son of God that is a little better then the Pope, did never claim
authority to dispense against the word of God, as the Pope here manifestly
does. You Jesuits being in the popes favor need not care what sins you
commit, for the pope may dispense with them whatsoever they be. Here you may
see that these are not Luptons lies, as you have written in the margent of your
book: for I have plainly told you where they are written and where you may
find them. But the indifferent reader may easily perceive, that a Jesuit has
lied most manifestly (...) a Christian.

The 49. part.
49. part.
YOu have also chopped in after your said falsified words (with are that the
papists hold the pope to be very God) certain other words of mine recited
almost two leaves before, and that not altogether as I spoke them, affirming
thereby that I say, the papists also hold the Pope to be the light of the
world, and the Savior of mankind. In deed in the 95. and 96. page or side
of my said book, I have recited these words, That the pope is the light that
is come into the world, that he is the Savior of mankind, but you have left
out the rest of the sentences before, which should have opened my meaning
therein, and the right sense of the same. And therefore to discredit me and
to make me seem a liar according to your words in your Margent: (which are
Luptons lies) you have devised and invented (most unhonestly and unchristianly)
words of your own, making all the words that follow to hang on the same.
Whose subtle dryft was thereby to prove me a liar, though the words I
recited against the Pope were true. For though the Pope has been called an
other God on the earth, and though he be called in printed books our Lord
God the Pope, (as before I have proved) and if he have been called the light
that is come into the world and the Savior of mankind with the rest (as
herein I shall prove the same God willing) yet if I should according to your
words have said that the papists hold that he is so: I should have made
a manifest lie, for he that tells a true thing untruly is a liar. And
therefore though you were not able to unburden the Pope of those titles that
only belong to God and to his Son Christ, yea and of the other, that neither
God nor Christ will dispense withal: yet you thought to make me a liar by
foisting in your own words that I never wrote nor meant.

But to set forth your unhonest dealing and to manifest my plain and true
writing: I will recyte mine own words of the Popes proud and too too
presumptuous titles, whereby I wrote these words wherewith you charge me to
be such a liar. And the occasion thereof was, because the Pope calls him
self the servant of Gods Servants: and would have men think that he is the
lowliest and most humble of all other: whereas he is the most proud and
Luciferlike of all other, and here follow my very words.

Yet mark the lowliness and humility of the pope, Persuasion from papistrie
page 95.
that calls himself the Servant of Gods Servants: In the late counsel
houlden at (...) in Rome, one Simon Begnius the Bishopp of Modrusa said thus
to Pope Council Lat. (...). 6. pa. 604
Leo, Behold the Lion is come of the tribe of Judah the root of David, etc. O
most blessed Leo, we have looked for thee to be our Savior.

This I think was sufficient for a Pope. If the Pope had not told us that he
is the Uicar of Christ, a man would have thought by these words, that he
had been Christ him self. And then immediately after, these are my very
words that follow.

In the late Chapter of Trident, Cornelius the Bishop of Bitonto said thus:
The pope is the light that is come Con. Tri sub Paul. 3. orati.
into the world, but men have loved darkness more then the light. Every man
that has done evil hates the light Cornelii Epis.
and comes not to the light. Bitontini.


Here I have not said that the papists hold, that the Pope is our Savior,
nor that he is the light of the world: But I have proved and plainly told
that the Bishop of Modrusa said to Pope Leo, O most blessed Leo we have
looked for thee to be our Savior. And also that Cornelius the Bishop of
Bitonto said, The pope is the light that is come into the world, but men have
loved darkness more then light. etc. Which you have not disprooued but
falsified as before is to be seen, neither yet confuted, unless your words
in the margent, (which is Luptons lies) has confuted it. And after that,
these are my words that follow, (but you left them out, belike you were
ashamed to utter them, as you might well enough.)

The pope suffered the Ambassadors of Cicilia to lie Paulus Aemilius lib. 7.
prostrate on the ground, and thus to cry unto him, as if it had been to
Christ: Holy Father that take away the sins of the world, have mercy upon
us: Thou that take away the sins of the world, give us peace.

Pope Sextus says, who so accuses the pope, can never be forgiven, and his
reason is this, he that sins Council. tom. 1 in purga. (...)
against the holy Ghost, shall never be forgiven, neither in this world nor
in the world to come. (I never heard so plainly what was the sin of the
holy ghost before,) If this be true, that to accuse the pope: is the sin
against the holy Ghost, then it is no (...) though the papists that believe
this, dare not accuse the pope, but think that he is most holy what so ever
he does, for fear they shall neither be forgiven in this world nor in the
world to come.

Surely they are sound and grounded papists, that believe the pope to be the
Lion of the tribe of Judah, that he is the root of David, that the pope is the
light that is come into the world, that he is the Savior of mankind, that
he is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world, that
whosoever accuses him of his wickedness, does sin against the holy Ghost.

Oh horrible, heinous, and intolerable blasphemy, that which is to be
applied to our Savior Christ the Son of GOD, and to none other: this vile
and most sinful wretch the pope, applies to him self. I trust there is
none of you, be you never so wylfull, obstinate, and bente to the popes Law,
but as soon as you hear this the popes great blasphemy, and how he takes
that unto him self, that is only due to Christ: but speedilye (except ye
are determined to be the children of the Devil) will fly from this
Antichriste and his doctrine, and embrace Gods most holy word, for if he
be not Antichrist, then there was never any, nor never will be.

These are mine own words which you have displased and falsified, whereby
the indifferent reader may plainly (...), that I have not said that the
papists hold the Pope to be very God, neither have I lied as you say, but
proved manifestly that the Pope was called an other God in the earth: that he
was published in printed books, Our Lord God the Pope: That the Bishop of
Modrusa said to Pope Leo, Behold the Lion is come of the tribe of Judah the
root of David, O most blessed Leo, we have looked for thee to be our Savior:
That the Bishop of Bitonto said, the pope is the light that is come into the
world. And moreover, (which you left out) that the Ambassadors of Cicilia
lying on the ground, said to the Pope, Holy Father that take away the sins
of the world, have mercy upon us, etc. and that it is the sin against the
holy Ghost to accuse the Pope, which shall never be forgiven.

A man would think all this is enough for a Pope, yet you of your (...) have
in your marge^t written Luptons lies: though you have not proved any one lie,
neither confuted any one word, but as an unjust Jesuit have falsified
displaced and left out my words, and foysted in your own words to make me
a liar. Have you not got a goodly gain hereby? yes I trow, for by your
discommending me and my book, you have so commended your self and your Popes,
that you are proved a falsifier and an envious Jesuit, and your popes to be
very Antichrists, in that they take upon them, that which is due unto Christ.
If the Pope have no better proctors then you: they will rather help to poppe
him out of his popedom, then proppe him up in his kingdom.

The 50. part.
Where as you allege (as is before mentioned) ye (...). part.
in ye 100. page of my book, I say, that the pope also knowledgeth ye thing,
taking himself indeed to be a God, I am most sure and certain, yt I have no
such words at al, musing what should move you to father such falsehoods on me,
unless you pretend purposely to procure me to publish further ye pernicious
presumptions of your popes. But though I cannot find your words in all the
same page, nor yet in any part of my said book: here I will describe the
most likest words unto them that are there to be found, and these are they,
Abbot Panormitane says out of Hostiensis, Christus and Papa faciu^t vnu^
co^sistoriu^, and excepto peccato, potest De elect cap licet Ab.
Papa quasi omnia facere quae potest Deus. Christ and the Pope make one
Consistory, and sin excepted, the Pope in a manner can do all things that
God can do. As you would have your Reader think, that your reciting of my
words is sufficient to make them lies: so I would have your Reader to judge,
that my reciting of these words is sufficient to prove Panormitan an
abominable and detestable blasphemer. And as you have falsified my words
first, and then committed them to be confuted of your Reader: so I have
written Panormitanes words truly, and commit them to the judgment of the
indifferent Reader. For I believe it is hard to find a Reader that will
think, that Christ and the Pope have one judgment Seat, and that the Pope
can in a manner do all things that God can do. But this I will speak on the
Popes behalf, though he cannot do all that God can do, yet am I sure he
can do more then GOD can do, for he can sin, he can be a liar, he can
be unmerciful and a tyrant, he can break his promise, he can promise more
then he can perform, and he can show himself wiser and mightier then he
is: all which God cannot do. And thus as Siluester (...) Siluester (...) (...)
(...).
says, that the authority of the Church of Rome is more then Gods word: So I
say the Pope is able to do more then God can do, or at the least, that that
God cannot do. Therefore though you a Jesuit do charge me with that I never
wrore: yet I have not fathered all the falsehoods on Panormitan that he has
written. This your falsifyng, displacing, and leaving out of my words, and
foysting in of your own, will procure but small praise to your self, and
less credit to your Pope.

The 51. part.
THen you leap suddenly (I know not upon what occasion) to the 172. page,
being seventy pages or sides 51. part.
from that place at the least: (which is a lusty leap of a Jesuit, and I may
say to you, a few such leapes will quickly leap over the whole book. Yea and
your leapes are so light, that it will scantly appear I believe, that you have
touched the book.) where, you affirm that I have written there, That the Pope
bids us not to forbear 172.
swearing any day: and so you leave that matter without any other confuting,
and go no further. If my matters hanged thus as you have patcht them together,
my book had been more meet to have been written to one of your unlearned
Popes, then to such a learned and prudent Prince. But because you have skipt so
swiftly and so far of to these few words, without declaring any other
words either before or after the same, and leapes to another matter 21. pages
or sides from the same: I will here write mine own words both going before and
following, whereby the indifferent Reader may see whether their matter, method,
and sense, be better where you have displaced the^, then where I first placed
them.

When I had confuted in my (...) book some part of the Popes doctrine, I came
then as occasion served to the disprouing of the Popes fast, and when I had
discoursed thereof as I thought meet, I followed then with these words, S.
Augustine one of the excelle^test Doctors (whose judgment Persua. from
papistrie.
I trust you will not refuse) writes: Upon what days we ought not to fast,
and upon what days we ought to Page 171.

either of our Lord, or of the Apostles. But what if S. Augustine had willed
us to fast (...) such days as ye Pope does appoint, and a thousand other
learned me^ more, yet we are not bound either to believe or follow him or
them, unless we find their sayings agree with Gods word, for Gods word
must lead them, but they may not lead Gods word. Therefore because your
Popish fast is not commanded nor allowed by the holy scriptures, but clean
contrary to the same as before is proved, therefore it is superstitious,
wicked, and highly displeases God, and so of us Christians ought not to be
used nor commended, (...) it be used for worldly policy. God commanded us to
refrain swering every day, but for fasting he appoints us no day: but the
Pope commands us to fast certain days, but bids us not forbear
swearing any day: Yet many of you regard the Popes law so much, and Gods
commandment so little, that you think it a heinous matter to break the

conscience to swear every day, which god has forbidden. Therefore keep the
fasting days commanded by our Queen for good order and policy, and not for
the Popes pleasure, for his holiness or hypocrisy. etc. Here have I written
plainly my very words with the occasion and circumstances thereof: whereby
the indifferent Reader may perceive that my words being in their own place
are not without method nor meaning, and that you have not dealt very honestly
with me, to shift my words so far out of their own place, into such a
strait, narrow and unfit corner, yea and that in such a strange place, and so
(...) from their friends, that should have taken their part, that they that
see them, may suspect them for vagabounds.

If I should use this order with your book as you do with mine, that is to

and chop (...) (...) other words 20 or 30. leaves of, yea and with such words
as appertained nothing to yt purpose, and write nothing between to confute or

AND then again you leap at one leap 21. pages or 52. part.
sides further, and there you cull or weed out about 8. of my words, and
join them to these words concerning swering before mentioned, nothing touching
that matter or purpose, and so you put them at your pleasure, without any
circumstance, in a most unapt place, where they agree as well as though a dog
and a cat were tied together. But the vnapter the place is, the better it
likes you. If you were as honest as you count your self holy: you would
suffer my words to go among their fellows and acquaintance, and not to
fetch them so far of, and thrust them you care not how, among alians and
strangers. Nay, besides yt you have spoiled them of my liuerey and covered them
with your own coat, whereby they seem not mine but yours, and these are they,
that he (which is) the Pope allows all priests to have (...).
harlots. But when you have thus defaced and displaced them, you neither
disprove them nor confute them: but as you have done with the rest, you leave
them to your Reader to confute. But if I had written the self same words: (as
I have not) yet I have proved them before to be true. But that the
indifferent reader may perceive that my words are neither so false nor so far
out of frame, as you would have them think: I will repeat mine own words,
and a few words besides that immediately go before, the better to open the
cause why I wrote them.

In that part of my book where I disprove the Pope for forbidding of Priests
marriages, and for allowing or suffering Priests to have concubines, among the
rest I have written thus: And in the Rubricke upon the 34. distinction,
Persuasion from papistry Page 192.
Is qui: is thus: It is lawful for him that has no wife, in steed of her to
have a concubine (here is good stuff) and what is a concubine but an (...)?

you not now perceive that the Popes law is a pure and Is qui.
holy law, that allows Priests to have harlots, and forbids Page 193.
them to have wives? Nay punishes them and burns them for Heretics that
have wives. Here it is manifest that I wrote not as you have misreported
(...), that the Pope allows all Priests to have harlots, but thus, may you
not perceive that the popes law is a pure and holy law that allows priests
to have Harlots? Here I have not only proved that you wrested and displaced my
words, but also that the Popes law allows Priests to have harlots, though
you have said before, that the Pope takes not money of the Curtezans and the
Harlots of the Stews of Rome for allowance of their life, but as a punishment
of their offense. This kind of dealing will get you small gain.

The 53. part.
BUT here I epsy another thing that makes me to 53. part.
muse, it seems you are weerie of leaping forward, for that on a soden you
leap or skip bacward. But you have a special property that few leapers
have, for whereas every leaper can leap further forward then backward, you
excelling al other leapers can leap further backwarde then forward: for
whereas your last leap forward was not past 21. sides or pages: now you have
leapt backewarde at one leap, 62. pages or sides, which is twice as much
backward as you leapt forward. I would hardly have believed (unless I had
seen it) that a Jesuit could have leapt so far backwarde at a leap. Out
of which place you did take and choose certain words, and join them to your
words before recited, which you cited as mine, and there you affirm that I
say, That he (that is Page 131.
the pope) gives license for money to keep as many (...) Page 131.
as a man will. And so (without any mo words) you leave them as you do all
the rest, for your Reader to confute if he will, for that either you cannot, or
else you have made some vow that you will not. But what if these words you have
charged me withal, be neither there nor in any other part of my book: would
you have then your reader judge, that a Jesuit has dealt justly with a
Christian: If there be any words there to that effect, I will recite them
whereby the indifferent Reader may see whether your words yt you father on me
agree with mine or not. But before I proceed any further, I will repeat the
words before of Cardinal Cusanus that gave me occasion to write the^, and
these are my very words. Mark also what that caterpiller Persuasion from
papistry Page 129.
Cardinal Cusanus writes for the authority of the Romish church above the
scriptures? I tell thee (says he) that there is nothing taken for Christ's
commandment, unless it be so allowed of the Church (meaning the church of
Rome) when the Church has changed her judgment, Gods judgment is likewise
changed. Oh abominable and detestable impes of Satan, though the whorishe
church of Rome may change in her judgments: yet God in his holy word is
infallible and unchangeable in his judgments. What hell hounds are these that
would make us believe, yt as the popes judgments do change, so Gods
judgments do change, and that nothing is taken for Gods judgments, unless
the Pope and the church of Rome allow of it? But contrary say I that the
comma^dements of the Pope, and of their church are nothing unless Christ does
allow the^. And after I have uttered these words, I discourst upon all the ten
commandments, alluding them as changed into the popes commandments.

And upon the commandment of committing adultrie, I write thus: And whereas
God says, Thou shall not com mit adultrie, now the judgment of the Pope and
the Page 131.
church of Rome is changed, and therefore Gods iugdement is changed. So that
this law by the judgment of the church of Rome must now be thus, thou shall not
marry, but thou may have a concubine or a harlot, to commit adultrie or
fornication withal, and thou shall have a license for money of the Pope to do
so, and so he shall allow thee to commit adultrie or to play the whoremonger or
harlot, but take heed thou marry not according to the law of God, for then
thou shall loose all thy living, and thou shall be taken for an heretic, and
the Pope will not dispense with thee therefore. These are my words, but
amongst them all your words before mentioned yt you have fathered on me, which
are these that follow, (That he gives license for money to keep as many
concubines as a man will) are not to be found: and therefore you lost your
labor to leap so far backward, for yt that was not there. But when you saw yt
you could not find there a fit lie for your purpose: you thought it was better
to devise a lie of your own, rather then you would return again without a
lie. But though I have not said that the pope gives license for money to keep
as many concubines as a man will: yet it appears plainly, that he permits
the women in his stues in Rome for money to play the whores as often as they
list, and men to lie with the^ as often as they will, and that he allows his
prelates and Priests to play the fornicators, (but in any wise not to marry)
as it appears in the Popes decrees by these words which are before
mentioned, He that has not a wife, in steed Distin. 34.
of her must or ought to have a concubine: And also by Is qui. (...). Anno.

other most devilish and Consti. Otho. bo^. de co^cub. clerico. remoue^d, licet

detestable decrees for mainteining of the same as in other places I have
declared before. Wherefore though you would have your Reader to think that
your words were mine, yet you leave them barely as you have done the (...),
without disprouing them, leaving them to be discredited of your Reader: Which
you your self were not able to confute, and yet they were your own words and
not mine, as before it is manifest. A true Christian would be (...) to be
taken in such a trippe, (...) I have now taken you being a Jesuit.

The 54. part.
AFter this, what sudden toy has taken you in the head 54. part.
I know (...), but you have iumpt forward forty sides or pages, where, belike
you have spied some thing that will serve your turn, which you have joined to
your former falsified words, and that are these, That his fast is, to cramme
in as many banketting dishes as men Page 171.
can: and there you stay and go no further, leaving them as you have done the
rest for your Reader to confute. But as (according to your wont) you have
written my words otherwise then I wrote them: so you left out those words both
before and after them, which opens the sense thereof, neither have you
declared how I compared the Popes fast and Christ's fast together, but because
you have written the^ both falsely and left the^ nakedly, to make your reader
have an evil opinion in me, and to discredit my book: I will here utter mine
own words that they may show whether they are so without order, sense, or
good meaning, as you have gone about to make them. And thus they are as
follow. And as this Romish Church has with her most wicked prayer, blotted
out the pure and perfect order of praying Persua. from papistrie.
which Christ did teach in the scriptures: even so she has with her vain,
fond, and superstitious fastings quite banished Page 170.
the true fasting required by the Gospel. For Christ in the Gospel says,
When ye fast be not sad as the hypocrites are, etc. But when thou fastest
appear not unto Math. 6.
men to fast, but unto thy father which is in secret, and thy father which
sees in secret, shall reward thee openly. Here Christ does appoint us that we
must not let it be known when we fast, but the popes fast is published, and
the days so commonly and openly commanded and appointed, that every one may
know when they fast. So that Christ has appointed his fasting so privily: but
the Church of Rome proclaims her fastes as openly. Christ has appointed no
days nor times for his fasting: The Church of Rome has appointed days and
times for her fasting. The meaning of Christ's fasting is to abstain from what
soever either meats or drinks that make us prone to sin: The popes fast is
to forbear flesh only, but permits men to eat all kind of fish though it
be never so dayntie and These are the words that both falsely and nakedly you
have chopped in so far from their own place and out of order.
deliciously dressed, and all kind of iunkettes and banketing dishes, with
delicate wines, as much as we will cramme and powrein: Christ's fast is to
keep our bodies low, to be in subjection to the spirit: But that is not
performed in the popes fast, but by their dainty dishes and drinks, the
Spirit is brought in subjection of the body. Christ's fast is a willing and an
uncompelled, abstinence: The popes fast is a constrained abstinence, and is
done of many against their wills. Christ's fasting is to make us virtuous and
holy before god: The popes fast is hypocritical, and to make us seem holy
before men. This is difference enough to show you that the Christian fasting
of Christ, and the common fasting of the Pope, are far unlike and do not
agree, so that the one shall have his reward hereafter of God, and the other
has his reward already of men etc.

And this is the circumstaunce, cause, and effect of my words. Thus the
indifferent reader may perceive, that you have not only altered my words,
but also through displacing them and cutting them from their (...), which
should have witnessed their true intent, (...), and meaning: you have gone
about to beguile him, yea and most maliciously to discredit or defame me.
But I trust by that time he has weyed my words and your words together, he
will regard my book as it is, and you as you are.

The 55. part.
IF I had made such bagaries in my book as you have done 55. part.
here in yours, you might then have justly said that I wandered without all
wit or learning, for whereas you pickte your last words (though falsely)
out of the 171. page of my book: now on the sudden you have leapt backwarde
again an 164. pages at the least, which is a great deal further then before.
So that it seems you have tried how far (if need were) you can leap
backwarde, especially at a dead lift. If you had leapt but half a score sides
or pages further, you had leapt quite out of the book: and then you had not
found this snare where with you have snarled me. Well, I must get out of it
as well as I may: and these are your words that follow, affirming that I say
in the 5. and 6. page of my book. That all papists are worse and deserve
(...) death, then drunkardes, thieves, murderers, page. 5. 6.
and pirates, and so you leave, neither disprouing nor confuting them, by any
other proof or argument, but refers it to your reader to confute if he list,
as you have done all the rest: or else perhaps you look that either they
should disprooue or confute them selves, or that these your knitting up words
that follow, should take the pains to do so much for you. Which are, This
is Luptons charitable doctrine, with many things more which I omit.

You have quoted in your margent that these my words are in the 5. and 6. page
or side of my book. Surely if the sever all matters that you write as mine,
were as sentencious as they be short, and were uttered as truly as you have
written them falsely: I am sure you would never have cumbarde your book with
them. There are but fifteen words of them in all, (...) that me thinks one
side might have holde^ them well enough, especially seeing two lines of one of
the sides of my book holds as much and more.

And I am sure it would have done so (as the end of the fifte and (...) pages
fall out) if you had written any one Sentence of mine as I wrote it. But as you
have falsisted my words before, so have you done now, and you seem to
include as you thought good, the whole circumstaunce and arguments of these
two sides or pages to that end in your aforesaid fifteen (...) words,
which is too strait a room for a Christian by way of argument to prove the
easiest matter that is. I know not what a Jesuit may do.

But that it may appear how you go about to disgrace my said book, and to
discredit me by deceauing your reader: I will here recite mine own words,
that the indifferent reader may see whether you have used me indifferently,
and whether you meant well to father such falsehood on me or not. In deed I
have proved by arguments, that you that are obstinate, disobedient, and
determined papists, are most earnest Enemies to England of all other, and
deserve death more then thieves, murderers, pirates, coyners and such like:
but that I have said that all papists are worse and deserve more death then
drunkardes, thieves, murderers and pirates, I utterly deny. And in that case
of death I named not drunkardes, for that we have no Law to put them to
death. And now here follows mine own words, which I doubt not but that the
reader will consider indifferently for us both.

Our Thieves are English enemies, whereof many steal Persua from papistrie.
for necessity: Unthrifts are English enemies both to themselves and to
other, for that they spend wastfully on Page 5.
them selves that other have need of: Drunkardes are English enemies, but are
most of all their own foes (unless they kill or hurt any in their
drunkenness) besides many such like Enemies: yet all these with many other,
are not such English Enemies (unless they be papists with all) but that
they love their prince, obey and follow her godly proceedings, wish her a
prosperous reign, and would fight (if need were) for her grace, and help to
defend this their Country from her foes: which may be counted as friends in
comparison, of you that are such papisticall Enemies.

For though there are many enemies, as thieves, murderers, pirates, coyners,
clyppers of money, and cou^terfeaters of the Queens seal, with diverse other,
yet you that are obstinate, disobedient, and determined papists, are the most
earnest enemies to England of all other: for if the Queens Majesty should
enriche, set in authority, or promote the said thieves, murderers, pirates,
coyners, clyppers of money, and counterfeaters of her highness seal (unless
they be papists withal) they would thank her, love her, obey her, and
observe (...) laws, and so of English enemies become English friends,
which you that are perverse and determined papists would never do, though
her grace should do so to you: for as harlots that love other better than they
love their husbands, (though their husbands love (...) never so well) set all
their whole mind, devises and studies, how to be rid of their husbands:
Even so you that are obstinate and determined papists (that are spiritual
fornicators) though the Queens Majesty should give you great livings, set
you in authority, or highly promote you: yet for all that your chief mind
and study would be, how to be rid of her grace, how to displace her, and
how to have a papist to rule in her room, whereby you might at your own (...)
commit spiritual whoredom with Idols, Images, and the Mass, which you love
better then your own loving husband Christ the son of God. And thus let
the Queens Majesty do for you never so much, yet you will not be English
friends, but utter enemies to her grace and to England your own native
Country, until of peruers papists you become perfect protestants which is
altogether my drift.

Yet I beseech you mark this and consider it well, though very need compel
the aforesaid (for the most part) to be thieves, murderers, pirates, coyners
of money, and such like, to be English enemies, which may and do daily become
English friends: yet there are such laws for them, as therefore they are put
to death. But for you that are obstinate and disobedient papists (that are so
great enemies to England without need) and that nothing can reclaim to be
friends to England: our most mylde and merciful Queen as yet has made no
such law to put you to death, nor grievously to punish you, though you
deserve death a great deal more (all things well weyed and considered) than
any of the other (...) enemies do. For if one that clippeth or diminishes the
Queens coin, whereon her Image or picture is but printed or stampte, is
worthily called a traitor, and by law therefore is hanged, drawn and
quartered: Then are not you worthy to be called traitors and deserve death,
which procure, wish or desire, by any mean, the displasinge of your prince,
the destruction of her person, the alteration of our most quyete and happy
state, the calamity of your Countrymen, the confusion of the common wealth,
and the ruin of this our worthy realm of England.

Here the indifferent reader may perceine, that by these my arguments I have
proved you that are obstinate, perverse, disobedient, and determined papists,
to be earnest and extreme (...) to England, and that you deserve death a
great deal more, the^ thieves, murderers, pirates, coiners of money, and such
like, but that all papists are worse and deserve more death, then drunkardes,
thieves, murderers, and pirates, as you have falsely fathered on me, I am
most certain I never said, wrote, nor thought: For there are many simple
seduced papists that are not of your mind. You did not mean to declare my
words effectually, neither that the truth of these my arguments should
appear, seeing you wrote but fifteen words of that which hardely would
be comprehended in fifteen lines: and yet most unchristianly you falsified my
saying, thereby to wrest the sense of my words to that, which I me self do
know is contrary and false.

And to what end have you done this: for soothe because you hate me for
telling of truth: you would have your reader despise me, as one that does
lie. You made a fair show with a sentence of Saloma^ in yt first side of your
book, that you Jesuits are utter enemies to lying, yea and as though there
were no such liars as we against whom you wrote, saying, a lying witness
shall have an evil end: but I trust the indifferent reader will say that
hitherto you have not taken nor proved me with any one lie, though I have too
manifestly proved you with so many, that though perhaps it will not make a
Jesuit blushe, it would make a Christian marvelously ashamed. If you sought
as much for the favor of God, as you desire the vaineglory of the world: you
would not use lying, which you seem to despise, nor yet such falsehood which
God does detest. But as your doctrine is diabolical, so are your doings
hipocritical. You know what place is prepared for liars well enough, God keep
both you and us from it. He that knows his masters will and does it not,
shall be beaten with many stripes: then you that bring the Scripture against
liars in the first side of your book, and use lying and manifest falsehood so
often in your book, (unless you repent and amend) are not like to be beaten
with few stripes. It is easy to perceive whose part you take, for if you
took Gods part which is the father of truth, he would guide you in truth:
but seeing you take the Devils part which is the father of lies, he leads you
to lying: therefore if you love God tell the truth, and if you hate the
devil, fly falsehood. Thus you have peest and patcht my sayings with your
(...) rags, and put in and pulled out, chopped and changed, and placed and
displaced my words as you thought good, with foisting in of your own words
which I never wrote: besides that you have most nakedly and barely without any
circumstances or arguments, (...) up such a sort of my matters in such a
strait room, that is, in 16. of your little short lines, the causes, proofs,
and effects whereof, are scantly comprehended in so many of my leaves, (...)
and without disproouing or confuting any part of the same, For other words
then mine own by you cut short, or (...), or thrust in for mine own, yon
alleged none, as here by your words appears: for I have written and set
down all your whole and very words concerning your deriding and slaundering
my book hitherto, without diminishing or adding any thing thereunto. Which
plainness if you had used with me: you had then written more matter and fewer
lies. And when you had shortened my sayings, maimed my method, cut off my
conclusions, hid my arguments, falsified my words, and thruste in what you
list, to the disabling of me, and discrediting of my book: (more craftelye
then Christianly) you conclude with these words,

This is Luptons charitable doctrine with many things more which Iomitte, and
so you end without any more words or further argument: whereby your reader
may perceive the truth of your dealing, though you say this is Luptons
charitable doctrine.

But how charitable soever it is: your doctrine and doings hither to are not
very commendable.

The 56. part.
ANd now that you have learnedly and cunningly The 56. part.
confuted the first and second part of my book, (according to your own
account) only with displasing, leaving out, and curtalling of my words, and
foisting in of your own, as before it is manifestly proved: you come to the
third part (as you call it) and confutes the same, only with brief reciting
of my words, and now and then falsifiyng the same as you did before, without
any one argument of your own for the disprouing thereof. Thinking belike that
your reader is bound to take all for lies that a Jesuit does recite. Me
thinks you have taken a very evil course for the discrediting of my book, for
if you are a credible man your self, (as a Jesuit can be none other) if you
recite a lie, it will be thought to be true because you have told it: as if
a liar chance to tell truth, it will not be believed but be taken for a
lie. Now choose you whether you will be counted a credible and a true man, and
thereby have my book counted for truth, because my words are recited by
you: or else to be a liar, and to have my book taken for false, because you
repeat or recite the words thereof. But as hither to I have not left out any
one word of yours, touching your confuting of my book, which you call the
first and second part: so I will not conceal or hide your words, touching
the rest of my book which you call the third part, Whereby the indifferent
reader shall perceive, how learnedly a Iusuite has confuted a christian with
saying of nothing. But it may be that as lay men's dalliyng and kissing of
women, must be construed or judged otherwise then priests dalliyng and
kissing of women, (as before is mentioned) so perhaps the Jesuits
disproouing or confuting, is contrary to the Christians confuting. For as the
Christians confute by writing, so the Jesuits may confute by thinking, which
is a thing necessary for your reader to understand. For though you do not
drisprooue or confute me by writing, yet he may suppose you have confuted me
by thinking. Therefore if the Jesuits have that advantage of the Christian:
they may easily and quickly confute what so ever is written against them. And
surely if you have confuted my book, it must needs be by thinking and not by
writing. And now without any falsehood, I will write your own words which
you recite as mine, and these are they that follow. Disc. pa. 185.

example: That one Burton, Bayliffe of Crowlande in Lincoln shyre, for

stink upon his beard, as made him continually to vomit for diverse days
until he died most miserably. I remember very well that in the 294. page of my
said book, I have described a strange example, and a doleful, and miserable
end of one Burton Bayliffe of Crowlande in Lincoln shire, a hasty procurer
and a great defender of the mass in Queen Mary's time, but not altogether
uttered in that sort, as here you have reported it: for I said not that he
was called R. for his punishment, But though you seem to deride me for writing
of it, yet you have not so much as with one word gone about to disprove it,
neither have you said that it is false or untrue, for if you could I am sure
you would. A strange matter that you would have your Reader to (...) my
words, and yet do not confute them, nor go about to disprove them. You say
he compelled him to say mass upon zeal of Papistrie, But I would know who
willed him to have such zeal in papistrie? Or who willed him to have such a
love to the mass, that he should hate his brother that God commanded (...)
to love, or threate to thrust his dagger in him, unless he would say mass?
(which cruel dealing you have left out). Surely it may well belong to the
religion of a Jesuit: but I am sure it is clean contrary to the religion of a
Christian. You call it in the margent Luptons miracle, no it was none of my
miracle, it was Gods miracle, yea and such a miracle, that if you had the
fear and grace of God: you would not so deridingly and contemptuously, write
of the mighty hand and great judgment of God showed therein.

You write also in the margent, a simple fellow that forgot by cutting of his
beard to save his life: Either you would have your Reader believe that it was
a lie, or that he might have saved his life by cutting of his beard. If it
(...) a lie, why have you not proved it a lie? And if it were true (as it was
very true) do you think that all the cutting or washing of his beard that
might be, was able to save save his life whom God did vetermine to bring to
his death? no no, it is impossible. If a little Sparrowe light not on the
ground without Gods providence: Then the dounge Math. 10.

enemy of God, without the foreknowledge and appointment of God, to the

of God was made blind through the falling of Swallows dounge: then why
should we not think like wise, through Gods providence, that this Burton the
enemy of God, might be brought to his death by the stenche of the dounge of a
Crow falling upon his Bearde? But because you have left out some of my words,
which manifests this Gods myraculous might the more, and has added something
of your own, that diminishes the credit thereof: I refer the Reader to the
very words thereof, written according to truth, in the 294. page of my said
book.

The 57. part.

miracle or to any such end, let the indifferent Reader judge. You leapt two
great leapes backwarde before, But now you have showed your utter most cunning,
whereby it seems that you exceed all Christians in leaping backward, for you
have leapt backewarde at this one leap 202. pages or sides, and all to fetch
out a meet miracle for your purpose. For amongst all the rest of the miracles,
where this Burton the massemonger was placed, (and yet of either side of him I
am sure there were (...) store) you could not find one that would serve your
turn. So that if you had left out this miracle, for which you leapte backward
so lustily: then Luptons miracle had been utterly mard for lack of company.
But to comfort him withal, you have taken this pains to leap so far
backward and all to get him a companion. And now I will recite your own
words, which you picked out purposely, because they should seem more like lies
then the (...). And these are your words which you allege as mine.

toe, *signifying thereby, that it was a part more fit for dogs to kiss then
men. Because this my last miracle may seem something dark to the Reader, as
you have told the tale, (for if it make for my turn, you had rather put in
less then all,) I will now recite mine own miracle and the occasion wherefore
I wrote it: whereby your Reader may see how truly you have told my tale, and
also what an apt and fit miracle you have found out, to be a companion of the
other miracle. But I must tell you this by the way, that there where you picked
out this miracle, I talked chiefly of the popes pride, and not of any miracles,
and therefore the more (...) for a miracle, if my matter had any good method.
And these are my very words, which show the occasion why I wrote this great
miracle of the dogs kissing of the Popes foot.

list. (It may be so but one may look Page 90.
all the bible over, ere he can find it). And also the Pope Auentinus in
Adriano.
has made it heresy (though Christ did not make it) for a king not to hold
his kingdom at his hands, etc. The Pope if we may credit his prerogative,
being of his own penning, is of no small power: for he is called Lord of
Lords and king of kings, he compels Emperors and Princes to swear
fealty and obedience to him.

Cardinal Zabarella says: the Pope does what him Stanislaius Orichouius in
Chinera Fol. 97.
lists, yea though it be unlawful, and is more than a god, (you called it
Luptons lies before, because I wrote that the Pope was called our Lord God the
Pope, but here one of the Popes own Cardinals has out lied me, for he
says that the Pope is more then a God). And one says, that a Priest is so
much above a king, as a man is above a beast: as much as God is better than a
priest, so much is the priest better than a king: he that sets a king
before a priest, sets the creature before the Creator. By this it appears
that priests are no small fools. If this be true, then it is no marvel that
men were wont to have priests in great estimation and reverence.

But I marvel that king Josias was so bold to burn such a number of Priests
that were so far his Superiors, and that were as far above him, as he
himself was above a beast. Truly I think it was because they could not show
him their Commissions, belike the left them at home. etc.

And now mark I pray you? whether these wicked Popes before mentioned with
many other that call them selves Christ's vicars, are not more like Lucifer the
Devil in pride, then Christ the son of God in humility? I think there was
never such Lordlinesse or pride in any worldly prince, as has been in diverse
of these wicked Popes: for the Pope suffers the Emperor (which is the chief
rular of all Christendom) to hold his stirrup, to hold his horse by the
bridle, to bear his train, and to kiss his feet. Yea and the Emperor was
shent of Pope Hildebrand, because he held the left styrrop in steed of the
right when he got upon his horse: there was never Emperor nor king, that ever
reciued any such service of any of the popes.

of this matter, was it not worthy to (...) fetched so far of, yea and that
with such a backward leap? You perceive well enough, (but that you list to
deride me, and to delude your Reader) that I wrote not this as one of gods
miracles, but as one of the Popes proud practices neither is it like in any
point, to your former tale of the myraculous work and great judgment of God
showed on Burton the (...) of Crowlande: unless the presumptuous pride of a
Pope may be compared to the desperate death of a Papist, and unless a dogs
snatching at the Popes foot, which did him no harm, be like to the dounging
of a Crow on a man's face (the Crow fleeing and the man riding) which brought
him to his death. You write in the margent. A poor pope that had no
cha^berlaine to keep out dogs, (...) though the office of the Popes
Chamberlain were to whip out dogs. Do you think that an Earls dog may
not come into a Popes chamber: or that a dog cannot be so luckie, as to have
one lick at a popes foot: What if GOD would have us to understand, that a
dog was as meet to kiss the popes foot: as an owl was fit to be the
popes holy Ghost:

Truly Christ washed his Apostles feet, but I never read that they kissed his
feet, yet Christ's feet were as well worthy to be kissed as the popes.
Therefore all wise men may well think, that the popes foot was more meet to
be kissed of the Earl of Wiltshires dog then of him self.

And whereas I have neither made this a miracle, neither written it for a
miracle, you thought to make it a miracle, by foysting in your own words,
which did clean turn and change my sense, for whereas I say, But also
snatched at his great toe, thinking belike it was more meet to be bitten of
dogs than to be kissed of men: You have written thus, but also snatched at
his great toe, signifiyng thereby that it (...) a part more fit for dogs to
kiss than men. Thus it is manifest, that you have thrust in signifiyng
thereby, for my words, thinking belike, (...) has so (...) and changed my
sense and meaning, that it appears a miracle by your words, which is, that
the dog did signify by his snatching at the Popes great toe, that it was a
part more fit for dogs to kiss then men. Therefore it must needs appear a
miracle to every one that reads this, as you (...) it, for is it not
myraculous for a dog to have such divine knowledge, to signify unto ye people,
wherefore he has done a thing, and specially such a mystical matter as ye
kissing of ye Popes foot: Truly you went very far before, when you told the
cause why M. Nicols was borne at (...) in Wales, and in telling my thought, or
what I would have said: but herein you have showed your self to be of a more
deep and profounde judgment, in showing the intent and meaning of the Earl
of Wiltshires dog, for you have flatly told, what he did signify by his
snatching of the Popes great toe. Wherefore though you counted this for my
miracle, I must confess it is none of mine but yours, for now I perceive a
Christian is far unable to compare with a (...) in making of miracles. It was
happy that you changed my words, and thrust in your own words in their
place: or else we had had no miracle of the dogs kissing of yt Popes feet. Now
I trust you will mende the word, Miracles, in the margent of your book, and
write Luptons Miracle in steed of miracles, for there was but two in all, and
one of them of right is returned to your self. Wishing that you, (because it
is not meet you should lack your due praise) to write in the margent against
the myraculous story of the Earl of Wiltshires dog, (The Jesuits miracle).
The (...) miracle.


But I muse that you took such pains to leap so far backward for this that
is no miracle, and might have, had half a dosen at the least hard by with
easily going forward, yea and touching the same matter, and tending to such
end, as the miracle of Burton, which you recited before. But because that
miracle of Burton (which you call my miracle) has lost his companion, and is
now clean without company, therefore I will place some of his old fellows
with him, (which you either saw not or would not see) for that I am loath that
he should be without some comfort or company: for you know it is very
uncomfortable to stand moping alone, and these be they that follow.

One Richard Denton having words of commendations Pers. from papistry. Page 296.
sent to him from one William Woolsey that was after burned for professing of
the Gospel: which were, that he marueiled that the said Denton tarried so
long beehinde him, seeing he was the first that delivered him the book of the
Scriptures into his hand, and told him that it was the truth, desiring him to
make have after as fast as he could. Which Denton said, when the said
message was done to him, I confess it is true but alas I cannot burn. But
after though he could not burn willingly in Christ's cause: he was burned
against his will not in so good a cause. For after that, his house being on
fire, he went in to save his goods, and thereby he was burned and lost his
life. And thus he was burned for earthly goods: that refused to burn for
heavenly treasure.

them that lay there for this our religion: died very myserably, being so
swollen, that he was more like a monster then a man, and was so rotten within,
that no man could abide the smell of him.

Behold also another miracle of God on the Parson Page 297.
of Crundall in kent, who upon Shrouesunday, having received the Popes pardon
from Cardinal Poole, came to the Parish Church, and exhorted the people to
receive the same, as he had done him self, saying, that he stood now so
clear in conscience as when he was first borne, and cared not now if he
should die the same hour, in that cleerenesse of conscience. Whereupon he
being stricken suddenly by the hand of God, and leaning a little on the one
side, immediately shronke down in the pulpet and so was found dead, speaking
not one word more, etc. Behold another strange miracle, which God showed on
the proud papistical persecutor Page 299.
of Gods servants in Queen Mary's time, Steeuen Gardener, then Lord
chancellor of England, who after so long professing of your papisticall
doctrine, when there came a Bishop to him on his death bed and put him in
remembrance of Peter's denying of his master, he answering again, said, that he
had denied with Peter, but never repented with Peter. And so both stinkingly
and vnrepentantly dyed. You could not spy this miracle, or else you Page 302.
thought it would not serve your turn. Here is also an other which if you
mark well, is more like a miracle then that that you made of the Earl of
Wiltshires dog.

As one James Abbas a professor of the Gospel in Q. Mary's time, was led by
the Shiriffe to the fire where he was burned at Bury, diverse poor people
(...) in the way and asked their alms, he (...) having no money to give the^,
and desirous yet to distribute something among them: (...) pull of all his
apparel saving his Shirte, and (...) the same unto them, to some one thing,
to some another. In the giving whereof he exhorted them to be strong in the
Lord, and as faithful followers of Christ, to stand steadfast (...) ye truth of
the Gospel, which he (through Gods help) (...) then in their sight seal and
confirm with his blood.

While he was thus charitably occupied and (...) instructing the people, a
servant of the Sheriffs going by and hearing him, cried out alowde unto them,
and blasphe mously said, believe him not good people, he is an heretic and a
mad man out of his wit, believe him not, for it is heresy that he says.
And as the other continued in his godly (...), so did this wicked (...) still
(...) (...) his blasphemous exclamations, until they came to the stake where
he should suffer, unto the which stake this constant Martyr was tied, and in
the end cruelly burned. But immediately after the fire was put unto him, the
same (...) that did rail on him, (saying that he was an heretic and mad)
was there presently in the sight of all the people stricken with a frenzy
(such was the great strocke of Gods Justice on him for his blasphemous railing)
and was then mad in deed, (as he before had charged the martyr with all)
who in his furious rage and madness, casting off his shoes withal, and the
rest of his clothes, cried out unto the people and said, Thus did James Abbas
that true Servant of God, who is saved but I am damned. And thus ran he
round about the town of Bury still crying that James Abbas was a good man and
saved, but he was damned. The Sheriff then being amassed, caused him to be
taken and tied in a dark house, and by force compelled him again to put on
his clothes: thinking thereby within a while to bring him to some quietness. But
he (all that notwithstanding) as soon as they were gone, continued his former
raging and casting off his clothes, and cried as he did before, James Abbas is
the servant of God and is saved, but I am damned. At length he was tied in a
Carte and brought home to his masters house, and within half a year after, or
there aboutes (he being at the point of death) the priest of the parish was
sent for, who coming to him, brought with him the crucifixe, and their (...)
host of the alter, which gear when the poor wretch saw, he cried out of
the priest and defied all that baggage, saying, that the Priest with such other
as he was, were the cause of his damnation, and that James Abbas was a good
man and saved, And so, shortly after he died.

This is something more like a miracle then that of the Earl of Wyltshires
dog. I much marvel that you took such pain to leap such a great leap
backward, to make a miracle of a dog, which was no miracle: and might with
stepping but a little forward, have found this wonderful and marvelous
miracle of a man. But you (...) and marvelous miracle of a man. But you
perceived full well that though it was a better miracle then the other: yet it
would not serve your turn so well as the other.

And whereas you (...) such a great leap backwarde, and all to pick out a
fantastical miracle out of a dog: you might (but that it liked you not) with
one small step forward, have quickly taken a most true and strange miracle
out of a Bull, which here I will place as a fit companion of that which you
recited of Burton the Bayliffe of Crowland. and as it liked you for your
pleasure, to put in that, calling it Luptons miracle: so it likes me for my
pleasure to put in this, which I am sure was Gods mighty miracle. And whereas
you began the first miracle with a Crow, I will now end the last miracle with
a Bull. And thus it follows. There was a certain godly woman condemned to be
burned for Page 305.
the professing of the Gospel in king Henry the Seuenthes time, by one Doctor
Whittington the Bishops Chancellor, which woman was burned in a Town called
Cheping sadberte, at whose execution was not only the said doctor Whittington
that condemned her, but also a very great number of people. And when she was
dead and burned, ye people began to turn homewarde. It happened in the mean
time, as these catholic executors were busy in the (...) of this silly Lamb
at the Towns side, a certain Butcher within the Town, was as busy in
slaying of a Bull, which Bull he had fast bound in ropes ready to knock him in
the head. But the Butcher (belike not so skillful in his art in killing of
beasts, as the papists be in murdering Christians) as he was lifting the Axe
to strike the bull, failed in his stroke, and smit a little to low: or else
how he did smite I know not, but this was certain, that the Bull something
grieved with the stroke, but yet not stricken down, put his strength to the
ropes, and brake loose from the Butcher into the street the very same time,
as the people were coming in very great prease from the burning of the godly
woman. Who seeing the Bull coming toward them, and supposing him to be (...)
(as was none other like) gave way for the Bull, every man shifting for himself
as well as he might. Thus the people giving back, and making a lane for the
Bull, he passed through all the throng of the^, touching neither man, woman, nor
child, till he came where the chancellor was. Against who^, the Bull as pricked
with a sodeine vehemency, ran full but with his homes, and taking him upon
the paunch: gored him through and through, and so killed him immediately,
carrying his guts, and trailing them with his horns all the (...) over, to the
great wonder of all them that saw it.

Now say you, is not this as likely to be a miracle that the bull killed the
chancellor among all this great throng of people, and to hurt none but him:
as for the Earl of Wiltshires dog, to snatch only at the popes great toe, and
at no bodies else? though you Jesuits do not take it to be (...) yet we
Christians are most certain that it is so. And because you shall see ye
difference between your papisticall persecutors, and our persecuted
protestants, I will here put you in mind of a marvelous miracle of one that
died for ye testimony of ye gospel, with is not full five leaves before your
mocked miracle of Burto^: this is it that follows, with is worth the marking.

A little before the death of one Thomas Hawks that was Page 285.
burned for the profession of the gospel at a town in Essexe called Coxhall,
certain of his frindes privily desired that in the mids of the flames he
would show them some token, if he could, whereby they might be more certain
whether ye pain of such burning were so great, that a man might therein keep
his mind quiet and pacient: which thing he promised them to do. And so
secretly between them it was agreed, that if the pain might be suffered, the^
he should lift up his hands above his head toward heaven, before he gave up ye
Ghost And when he was brought to the stake to be burned, there mildely and
patie^tly he addressed himself to ye fire, having a strait chain cast about
his middle: after whose (...) prayers made unto god, the fire was set unto him,
in ye which when he continued long, and when his speech was taken away by
violence of the flame, his skin also drawn together, and his fingars consumed
with the fire, so that all me^ had thought certainly he had (...) dead,
sudde^ly, and contrary to expectation, the said blessed servant of God (being
mindful of his promise before made) reached by his hands burning on a light
fire (which was marvelous to behold) over his head to the living God, and
with great rejoicing (as it seemed) struck or clapped them three times
together. At the sight whereof there followed such an outcrie of the people,
and especially of them which understood the matter, that the like commonly
has not been heard, and so this blessed servant of God, straight way synking
down into the fire, gave up his Spirit.

If you had been as quick a sighted Christian as you were a blind Jesuit,
and as pure a Protestance as you were a perverse papist, you would have seen
this marvelous miracle, and not have ouerleapt it so far backwarde. I
marvel that you took such pains to leap an hundredth leaves for a false
miracle of a dog, and might so easily (and that so nie at hand) have had a
true miracle of a faithful man. Belike it was either to bright for your dymme
eyes to behold, for that you made such haste to the dumb dog of an Earl:
that you had no leisure to stay and behold the Servant of God.

Thus if you had been as well willing to make but half a step as it were
either backwarde or forward, as you were of set purpose wilfully bent, to make
such an unreasonable leap backewarde, you might have been easily spedde of
better and truer miracles then of the Earl of Wyltshires Dog. But because
you thought that (without any further circumstaunce as you would dress them)
the one would be derided and the other discredited: therefore you picked them out
of all my whole book for the nonce, and as a godly godfather have given them a
name, calling them Luptons miracles. But because I have proved, that of the
Earl of Wyltshires Dog to be a miracle of your own making, therefore from
hence forward it shall be called the Jesuits miracle. And now seeing you
began with the first miracle, I have made an eude with the last miracle, hoping
you will win as little credit by meddling with my miracles, as you get gain
by controlling of the title of my book.

Thus you have cunningly confounded my matter, and miracles, only reciting
them as it pleases you, adding to your own words, and diminishing mine as
you thought good, without either disproouing or (...) them at all, according to
your wonted order: which you would have your indifferent reader think, to be
a sufficient disproouing and confuting. But I hope the indifferent reader (not
armed with affection) will judge that you have wandered unwisely, and used me
unchristianly.

The 58. part.
ANd then you end (with your supposed or thinking confutation The 58. part.
of my book) with these words following. Disc. pa. 186.


All these things and many more the like, he proves out of master Fox his
Martirologe, otherwise called Acts and Monumentes, tied with long chains in all
Churches of England, to be read with devotion.

The more like the rest of the miracles be to these, the more I am sure you
mislike them. I need not be ashamed to prove them by the book of that
learned and godly M. Fore, called Acts and Monuments, for that it is a work of
great credit and authority. Which book he has most diligently and painefully
set forth with such knowledge and truth: that you may bark or rail against
it, but the learnedest Jesuit or papist of you al, shall never be able to
disprove, confute or confound it, do what you can. And though it be but lately
set forth and the author thereof yet alive: I have proved before by sufficient
arguments, that the things therein, are now as well to be produced, and
also to be credited, as though the author were dead a thousand years since.

The 59. part.
YOu say that it is tied with long chains in all Churches 59. part.
of England to be read with devotion. I would yt a Jesuit were herein no
liar. If you had not your popish mass and your other idolatrous service in mo
Churches in Italy, France, and Spain, and Gods word truly preached in all
the rest, then we have those books in the Churches of England, the popes
pomp and power would quickly perish, and your romish Church would florishe
but a while.

As you have continued your course against me, most falsely and untruly, so you
have ended the same with a manifest untruth. For I am most assured that every
Church in London has neither the same book tied nor untied, (I wish they had)
then can it be thought that every Church in England has them: I am most
certain that no small number that favor your papistical religion here in this
realm of england, will think that herein you have waded too far and fowlie
over shot your self, who must needs witness against you that this same book
that you say is tied with long chains in all Churches of England, is not in
the Churches where they dwell neither tied nor untied.

Before you had some shadow to cover your lies, but you can not shadow this
it is so manifest. You said before that I wandered by certain controversies,
but as without all wic and learning: but here you have unwisely ended with a
lie without any (...). It seems that you had forgotten the beginning of your
book, when you wrote the latter end of your book, for in ye first side of
your book, you bring a text of Salamo^ against liers: but in the latter end of
your book, without either Scripture or text you play the lier your self. What a
shame is it for you at your first entry to seem to defend truth, and to end
your book with such a manifestlye? Your own words in the beginning of your
discovery do show what you are like to come to, for the latter end of your
discovery. For there you say according to Salamon, a lying witness shall have
an evil end: then can you look, (making such an apparent lie in ye latter
end of your book) for a good end. If you were a favorer of the gospel as
you are an enemy to the Gospel, you would then frame your self to speak
truth, as now you give your self, to fable and lie.

As the spirit of God does direct the godly professor of Gods word to write
truly: so the spirit of Satan procures the professors of Papistrie, to
speak or write falsely.

And where you say (rather mockingly then modestly) to be read with devotion:
A man may read the wise and learned answers, ye pacient sufferings, and the
whippings, scourgings, and torme^tings of the godly Gospellers with more
devotion, then your Romans that before you wrote of, can whip and scourge
themselves for their own offenses, yea though they scourge all the blood out
of their bodies. And though you Jesuits think, that the reading of that most
excellent and necessary book, will work small devotion in them that read
it: yet we Christians do believe, that you that write against the truth,
falsifiyng men's writings, and make such manifest lies, do not the same with
any godly devotion. I hope we Christians may read master Foxes martyrologe
with as great devotion, yt expresses the doyngs of the Saints of God, that
dyed wrongfully for professing Gods word as you Jesuits may read your Popish
martyrologe of the popes traitorous Saints that were justly executed for
murder and treason. Thus though you thought utterly to defame and discredit
me being a Christian: by that time yt the indifferent Reader have read this
thoroughly, I think you will wiune but small credit though you be a Jesuit.

The 60. part.
YOu speak these words in the knitting up of yuor said Discovery, As long as
there shall be either honest, virtuous, learned, wise, modest, noble, or
gentle mind in England, so long shall we gain by these their proceedings.
You have a very good opinion in your works and writings, for though your cause
be never so course, and your writings be never so false: yet by your saying,
there is never honest, virtuous, learned, wise, modest, noble nor gentle mind
in England, but such as take your cause to be good, and your religion true.
And as long as there is any such you shall gain and that by our writings and
proceedinges. Then by this your sayings it appears, if you chance to loose
and we gain by your proceedinges: then there is never an honest, virtuous,
learned, wise, modest, noble, nor gentle mind in England. This is the
definitive sentence of a Jesuit, therefore it must needs be true. Wherefore
it were best for us to suffer you to gain by our proceedings, least all our
honest, virtuous, learned, wise, modest, noble or gentle minds in England
vanish quite away out of England, and then were England utterly marde. But if
you count your losses with your winnings, I fear at the end of your account,
your gain will not be very great, nay it will seem rather that you have
lost then won: and so your loosing has made us loose all our honest, wise,
and virtuous, Noble men, and Gentle men, wherewith England was wont to
florishe when you did gain or win. What a most spiteful saying and an
arrogant (...) is this of a Jesuit (...) though there were never an honest,
virtuous, learned, wise, modest, noble nor gentle mind in England, that are
contrary to your religion, or that will not suffer you to gain by your lying,
and to win by your wicked writing. Here in the knitting up you have showed
what you are, for as you have proceeded with untruth so you end with falsehood.
And as you have run this your raze untruly and unchristianly: so you have
ended the same most (...) and arrogantly. And now for that you have detracted
my said book (called a persuasion from papistrie) to bring it into such
contempt, that thereby it should not be read: though you be a Jesuit you
may be deceived, for whereas you thought to have blown out ye fire, it may be
ye thereby, you have kindeled the flame. For you have so (...) me to defend
it, that many perceiving hereby how unjustly you have charged me with (...):
may happily read and peruse it, that otherwise (if you had not been too busy
with your pen) should never have heard of it, whereby your doctrine may the
more be despised. And thus (as many have done) perhaps you may loose by that
you hoped to win. I (...) you are fullier answered then you looked for, and
more reproved and confuted then your friends would have thought: for your fair
show is turned into a foul shadow, your pretended wisdom into manifest
folly, and your curious cunning, into counterfeating and lying: though some
(more armed with affection than ruled with reason) have bragd, that your
learning is so great, and your said book so true, that the one should seem
incomparable, and (...) other unreprovable. Not doubting but that they that
shall read this my book, written as an answer to you, and in the defense of
my said book, called A persuasion from papistrie, will not easily be
persuaded that my said book which you count so light, and so full of lies,
is without all method or matter: which I dedicated and delivered with mine own
hands to the most famous learned and merciful princes of the world, whose
subject I am, and who^ I am most bound under God to obey. And if I were as
great a liar as you would feign make me: yet what wise man will think that I
durst once presume to line that book with lies, that I gave to her grace? But
though you (as it becomes a Jesuit) went about as much as in you lay to
diseredite me and my said (...), and thereby to make me loose the favor of
men: yet I (as beseems a Christian) wish with all my heart, that you may
(...) the holy (...), and of a false Jesuit become a true Christian, whereby
you may obtain the favor of God.
