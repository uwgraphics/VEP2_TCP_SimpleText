Explicit
Here begins the book which the knight of the toure made / And speaks of
many fair ensamples and thensygnementys and techyng of his daughters Prologue
IN the year of our lord a^ M / three honderd / (...) / as I was in a gardyn
under a shadow / as it were in thyssue of Aprylle / all moornyng and pensyf /
But a little I reioysed me in the sown and song of the fowls sauuage / which
song in their langage / as the Merle / the Manys the thrustell / and the
nyghtyngale / which were gay / and lusty / This sweet song enlustyed me / and
made mine heart all tem^ye / So that then I went remembryng of the time
passed in (...) youth / How love had hold me in that time in his se^uye^ b^
great distress / In which I was many an hour glad / and ioyeful / and many
another time sorrowful / like as it (...) to many a lover / But all mine euylles
^aue rewarded me. Sithe that the fair and good has given to me / which has
knowleche of all honor / all good / and fair mayntenyng / And of all good
she seemed me the best and the floure^ In whom^ I so much me delyt^d / For in
that time I made songs / lays. Roundels balades / Vyrelayes / and new songs
in the most best wise I could / But the death. which spares none has taken
her / For whom I have received many sorrows and heuynesses In such wise that
I have passed my life more than twenty year heavy and sorrowful / For the very
heart of a true lover shall never in any time ne day forgete good love / but
evermore shall remember it / And thus in that time as I was in a great pensyfnes
/ and thought I behold in the way / and saw my daughters coming / Of whom I
had great desire that they should torn to honor above all other thing /
For they ben young and ^itil / and dysgarnysshed of al wit and reason / wherefore
they ought at beginning to be taught and chastysed curtoisly by good ensamples
and docerynes as did a queen I suppose she was queen of hongry / which fair
and swetely chastysed hell daughters / and them endoctryned as is contained in
her book / And therefore when I saw them come toward me / I remembryd me of the
time when I was yo^g and roode with my felauship and companyes in poytou / and
in other places / And I remember me much well of the fayttes and sayenges /
that they told of such things / as they fond with the ladies and damoyselles
/ that they required and prayed of love / And if one would not entende to their
prayer / yet another would require without abydyng / And though so were that
they had good or evil answers / of all that they rought not / For they had
neither dirde ne shame / so much were they endurate and acustomed / And were
much well bespoken / and had fair langage For many times they would have oueral
deduyte / And thus they (...) no thing but deceive good ladies / and
damoysellys. and be^^ ouerall the tidings / sum true / and sum lesynges /
Whereof there happed many times. iniuryes / and many vylayno^^ diffames without
cause and without reason / And in all the world is no gretter treson / than
for to deceive gentle wymmen / ne to encrece any vylaynous blame / For many
ben deceived by the great othes^ that they use / whereof I debate me oftyme with
them. And say to them / ye over false men / how may the god (...) suffer you
to live / that so oftymes ye periure and forswere (...) sel^ / For ye hold no
feythe / But none putt hit in array / by (...) they be so much and so full of
disaraye / And by cause I (...) that time so led and disposed / yet I doubt
me that sum (...) such in this time present / Therefore I concluded that I
would (...) make a little book / wherein I would do be wreton the good manners and
good deeds of good ladies and wymmen / and of their lives / so that for their
virtues and bountees they ben honored / And that after their death ben
renommed and preysed and shall be unto the end of the world for to take of
them good ensample and contenaunce / And also by the contrary I shall do
write and set in a book the myshappe and vices of euylle wymmen / which have
vsyd their life / and now have blame / To the end / that the euylle may be
eschewed^ by which they might err / Which yet ben blamed / shamed / and
dyffamed / And for this cause that I have here said / I have thought on my well
bylouyd dough^ers^ whom I see so little to make to them a litil book / for to
learn to read / to the end that they may learn and study / and understood the
good and euylle that is passyd / for to keep them fro him / which is yet to
come / For such there be that lawgheth to fore you / which after your back
goo mockyng and lyeng / Wherefore it is an hard thing to know the world that is
now present / And for these resons as I have said I went out of the gardyn /
and fond in my weye two (...) and two clerks that I had / and told to them
that I would make a book and an examplayre for my daughters to (...) and
understand / how they ought to govern them (...) keep them from euylle / And
then I made them to (...) before me the book of the bible. the gestes of the
king (...) of france and of England / / and many other (...) historyes / and
made them to read every book / And did do mak^ of them this book. which I
would not set in ryme but al (...) in prose for to abredge / and also for the
better to be vnderstonde^ And also for the great love that I have to my
daughters (...) I love / as a fader ought to love them / And then mine (...)
shall have parfyte joy. if they torn to good and to honor (...) is to serve
and love god / and to have the love and the grace (...) neighbors / and of the
world / And by cause every (...) mother after god and nature ought to teache and
inform their children and to distourne them fro the evil way / and te show
(...) them the right weye and true pathe / as well for the sa^a^cion of their
sowles / as for thonoure of the body (...) have made two books / that one for
my sons / and that ^ther for my daughters for to learn to read / And thus in
learning (...) shall not be / but that they shall reteyne sum good ensample
/ or for to flee the euylle and reteyne the good. For it may not be but in
sometime they shall remember sum good ensample or some good lore after that hit
shall fall / and come to their mind in spekyng upon this matere /

Thus ends the prologue
Here follows the book of thensygnemens and techynges of the knight of the
Toure / And first how god ought to be honored above all things / Capitulo
primo
IT is much fair and right a noble thing for to see and behold thauncyent
hystoryes / which have been wreton of our predecessors / for to show to us
good ensamples / and to aduertyse us how we may see the good dedes^ that they
fo^owed / and teschewe the evil as may be sent / that they eschewed / Then I
shall speak / and say to them thus / My right dear daughters for as much as
I am old / and (...) I have seen the world more longer than ye have / I shall
(...) to you a party of the world after my seyence / which is not (...) great
/ B^t the great love that I have to you / And the (...) I have / that ye torn
your hertes and your though^^ (...) god / and to serve him / by which ye may
get well and (...) in this world and in that other / For certeynly all the
(...) honor / and al thoneste of man and of woman (...) and of the grace of
his holy spyryte / And also gyue^^ (...) and short in worldly and erthely
things / such as (...) him / For all thing falls at his playsyre and (...)
And also gives for all such well and service as is (...) an honderd fold
double / And therefore my right dear (...) is good to serve such a lord. which
rewarded an honderd (...) /

How the matyns and hours ought to be said / Capitulo (...)
aNd by cause that the first work and labor that man or woman ought to do /
is for to ad^ure and worshipe our lord / and say his seruyse / That is to
understand / that as soon as he awaketh / he ought to know le^^che him for
his lord and maker / and him self to be his creature That is to wete^ to say
his matyns / hours and his orys^ns* if he be a clerk and to render and yield
to him thankynges and ^^^synges / As to say / laudate dominu^ omnes genc^s
Benedicamus patrem et filium cum sancto spiritu / or such o^^er things as
yield and give thankynges and preysynges unto god. For it is a gretter thing to
thank and bliss our lord god / than to re^uy^^e and demand him / For
request / demand / yefte of guerdon and th^nkynges / and to yield preysynges
is th^ffyce of angels* which alwey give thankynges / honor / and preysyng
unto god / for it is better to thank god / than to require him / by cause he
knows better what is good for a man or a woman than they wot them self /
After we ought to pray for them / that been deed to fore we goo to sleep / And
also the deed men pray for them / that pray for hem / And also forgete not
the blessid and sweet Vyrgyne Marye / which night and day prays for us / And
also to recommaunde you to the holy saints of heaven / And when this is done /
then may ye well goo sleep / For this ought to be done as often as ye awake

Of two daughters of the Emperor that one sinful And that other devout /
Capitulo Tercio
IT is contained in thystorye of Constantynople. that an Emperor had two
daughters / Of whom the youngest was of good manners and loved god / and
honored and prayed to him alwey when she awoke / and much deuoutely pra^^ for
the sowles of them that were deed / And these two young (...) lay both in one
bed / And when the oldest awoke / and (...) her suster say her prayers / she
mocked and scorned her / (...) said to her that she letred her to sleep /
Then it happed that youth and the great ease that they had been norysshed
in / (...) them to love two knights brethren / which were two goodly men
and much gentle / And so long endured their playsyre and love that they
discovered each to her love the secret of their amerous desire / in so much
that they set a certain hour to these knights for to come to them pryuely
by night / And when he that should come to the younger / supposyd to have entryd
within the Courteyns / him seemed that he saw moo than a thousand men in
sudaryes like deed men / which were about the damoysell he had so great
fere and hydoure. that he was al affrayed / Whereof he took the feures / and
was seek in his bed / But to that other knight if happed no thing so. for he
gate the oldest daughter of the emperor with child^ And when the Emperor
knew that she was great with child / he made her to be drowned in a nyt / and
did do the knyt to be flayn al quyck. Thus for this false delight they deyde
both twe^n / But that other daughter was saved like as I have said and shall
say / when it came on the morn it was said oueral / that the knight was seek in
his bed / Then she for whom he took his maladye went for to see him /
And he told to her all the truth / how when he supposid to have entrid within
the courteyns / he saw a merueylous great nombre of deed men in sudaryes /
about her / Of whom he said / I had so great dread and hydoure / that I was
taken with thaccesse or feures / and also was al most out of my wit for
fere / and yet am all affrayed / And when the damoysel herd the truth / she
was mer^^ueylously ioyeful / and thanked god much humbly / which (...) saved
her fro perisshyng and dishonor / And from than (...) on / she worshyped and
prayed god alwey when she a (...) And praid much deuoutely for all Christian
sowles more (...) fore / and kept her chastely and clean / And it was (...)
that a great king of greece desired and demanded her (...) to have her in
marriage / And her fader gafe her to (...) was after a good lady and devout /
and of much (...) / Thus was she saved for prayeng to god / and (...) him /
and also for prayeng for them that been deed / And (...) suster / that scorned
and mocked her / was dr^wned and ^^^^^noured / And therefore my dear daughters
remember you (...) this example alwey when ye awake / And sleep not again
(...) that ye have praid for them that been departed out of this (...) like as
did the daughter of the emperor / And yet (...) would well that ye should know
thensample of a Damoyselle which a greet lord would have for fair or foul
for to accom^plysshe his foul playsyr and delight

How we ought to pray for them that been deed Capitulo quarto
IT happed in such wise / that this lord did do espy / where as this
Damoyselle was entered in to an hoole where as she entrid and rested there for
dread of him / that was in a busshe / And she said vygylles for the deed men /
And this great lord entryd in to the hoole ^ And saw her there / And wend
anon to have accomplyss^yd his foul delight / But when he supposed to have
taken her / him seemed that he saw more than ten thousand prysonners buried
that kept her / And had of them so great fere and dread / that anon he turned
and fled / and sent to her word / that for certain / he would never pursewe
her more for such fayte / and that she had over great a company that kept
her / And after he came / and spak to her and demanded of her what was the
great company / that was with her / And she said that she knew of no thing at
that time when he came / sauf that then she said the Vygylle for them that
were deed / And then thought the lord well that they were they that kept her
/ And therefore this is a fair example to pray for them that been departed out
of this world at al times

How we ought to say our hours and prayers cao. / vo
Fair daughters when ye rise out of your bed / then enter in to the
seruyse of the hyhe lord and begin ye your matyne / This ought be your first
werk / and your first labor / And when ye shall say them say ye them with
good heart And think ye on none other thing if ye may / For ye may not goo two
weyes at ones / For ye must goo that one or that other / Thus is it of the
service of god / For as the wyseman says in sapyence / As much avails it
him / that redeth and vndersto^deth not / as it does to him / that hunteth /
and takes not / And therefore / he that thinks on erthely things / and seyth
his Pater noster^ or prayers. that touches heavenly thynges^ does a thing that
is contrary / And it proufyteth not / it is not but for to mock god And
therefore says the holy scripture / that the short prayer perceth heaven. But
that is to say / that more avails a short prayer and said with good heart /
and deuoutely / than a great and long prayer / and to think on other things
/ And when more is said deuoutely / than is it more worth / and more deseruyth
he merit And yet seith the holy scripture / that like as the sweet dew of
May and of Aprylle pleseth much unto the earth / and attempreth it swetely in
making to germyne and fructyfye / Right so ben the heures and prayers deuoutely
said playsaunt to fore god Then ye shall find in many places / and specially
in the lege^de of holy confessours^ of vyrgyns / and of other holy wymmen
which made her beds of hard and roughe things / and lay thereon for to
sleep the less / and to have the less rest / For to weep often / and many
times to wake^ for to enter in to prayers / and in the service of god / wherein
they held hem day and night / And for that service and labor have they gotten
/ as it is showed openly to the world / that they ben in the holy joy with
him / by that / that he does for them euydent miracles / For thus god rewards
the service that is done to him an honderd fold double as I have seid to fore /
And therefore fair daughters say your heures and prayers deuoutely^ and with
good herte^ without thy^^kyng on any other thing / And beware that ye break
not you (...) fast / till that ye have said your matyns and heures / For a
(...) belly shall never be humble ne devout / Also see well to (...) all the
masses that ye may here / For great good sha^^ (...) therof^ Whereof I shall
say an ensample of this mater^

How good daughters ought to fast / Capitulo s^xto
tHere was a knight / that had two daughters (...) was by his first wife / And
that other / by his second And she that he had by his first wife / was
meruayl^^^ly devout / ne never would ete / till that she bad said all her
houre^ and herd all the masses that she might here / And that other d^^^^ter

her will / For as soon as she had herd a (...) mass / and had said two
or three pater nostres / she went in to the garderobe / and there ete a soupe
or sum lycorous thing (...) said that her head oak for fasting / but all this
was but an euylle customme / And also when her fader and mother were a bed*
then must she goo ete sum good morsell^ or sum good (...) And this life
led she / till she was married unto a kynt which was wise and subtyle / Then
it happed that her lord knew her manner / which was euyll^^ both for the
body / and the soul and told / and showed this to her much honestly and
swetely many times / and said she did evil to use such a life but never show
to leave it / for fair spekyng / ne for thing / that he couthe say or do
Then it happed / that on a night / he had slepte his first sleep / And tasted
beside him / and found her not / whereof he was much angry / And aroos from his
bed / And cast about him a furryd mantell / and entered in to his garderobe.
where as his wife was with his clerk / and two of his seruauntes^ and ete and
played so. that there was a great noise / and the men and wymmen ^aped to geder
each with other / And the lord that saw all this arraye was much wroth and
fell / And held a staf in his hand for to smite one of his servants /
which had embracid one of the wymmen of the chamber / and smote so sore that
servant / that a splynt sprange out of the staf in to the one eye of his wife /
which was by him / in such manner / that by mysauenture her eye was smeton
out / and lost her eye / And thus her husbond had her in such hate. that he
took his heart fro her / and set it in another / in such wise that her
household and menage went all to naught and to perdicion / This happed by the
evil governance of his wife / which was acustommed to live dyssolutely and
disordynately / both on mornings / and on evenings / whereof the great part
of the harm was here is / by cause she lost her eye / and the love of her
husbond / Then was she in an evil astate and much lassed and less set by
of al men that knew her. And therefore it is good to say their hours / and
here all the masses fastyng^ And accustomme them to live sobyrly and honnestly /
For all comes by accustommaunce and usage / as it happed to her suster / She
vsyd fro her youth to serve god / and to goo to the church / as for to say
her matyns and hours deuoutely / and here all the masses fasting / And
therefore it happed that god rewarded and gafe to her a knight rich and
puyssaunt / And she lived with him well and honestly. and in good and great
pees. And then it happed that their fader which was a wise man went for to
see his two daughters / And fond with tholder great honors and great richesse
/ and was received there much honorably / And of that other which had her
eye out / he fond her all out of arraye And how she had governed her nycely
and wantonly / Then it happed that when he was comen home again / he
recounted to his wife / And much cruelly repreued her / by cause she had lost
her daughter / by cause she had kokered her and norysshed tendyrly / And that
she had given her the reyne ouerlong in suffryng her to do all her will /
wherefore she was in an hard caas / And by this ensample it is good to serve
god^ and here all the masses / that may be herd fasting / And to take on her /
honest and sobrenes of mete and drink. in due time / as about the hour of
tyerce / at myd day / at souper at hour couenable / after the time / For such

Of a common woman that went to see her love / and fylle in a pytte / Capitulo
Octauo
Then I would that ye knew thexample of a folysshe woman that fasted the
friday / of whom I shall tell to you the hystorye / There was a folysshe woman
in the Cite of Rome / that alwey fasted the friday in thonoure of the passion
of sweet Ihesu Criste^ And the saturday in thonoure of the Vyrgynyte of our
lady / And alwey these two days she kept surely^ Hit happed on a night that
she went to ward her love / when it was derk / And suddenly or she was ware /
she fell in to a pytte^ which was twenty fadom deep / And as she was falling
/ she escryed with an hyhe voys / lady help / and she fylle upon the water /
and fond it hard as a plank. And there came a voys to her that said / in
thonoure of the vyrgyn Marye / and of her sone for whom thou have fasted /
thou art saved / And fro hensforche keep thy body clean fro the sin of thy
flesh / And on the morn people came for to draw water / and fond the woman in
the pytte out whereof anon she was drawn up / and let goo / And the people
merueyled much how she was saved / And she said to them how that a voys had
said to her / that it was for the fastings / that she had kept the friday and
saturday / as ye have herd / And for this grace that god and the blessid Vyrgyn
our lady saint Marye had done to her / she made a vow to them / that she
should keep her chaste / and clean. And should use her life in the service of god
and of his chirche^ and ever after night and day she s^rued in the church for
to light the torches / tapres / and lamps / and to keep clean the church /
Now on a night / there came to her a Vysyon / that she drewe^ and took out of a
donghylle a vessel / like to a plater of silver / And when she beheld hit /
she saw therein many black spots / and a voys came saying. scour and make
clean this plater^ And take awey tho blak spots / so long / till it be as
clean and white / as it was when it came from the hands of the maystre
goldsmythe / And this aduysyon came to her three times / And when she awoke / she
remembryd her aduysyon to god And when hit was hyhe day / she went for to
confess her / to an holy man / and told to him her aduysyon / And when the
good man had herd all the manner / he said to her / Fair daughter / ye ar much
beholden to serve god / when he will your salvation / and warns. and
shows to you / how ye ought to wasshe you / and make you clean by confession
of your sins / And I shall show you / hou he has showed by your aduysyon
the Vessel of silver / which was foully bespottyd of the donghylle / which
sygnyfyeth the soul that is in the body / And if the body consentid not to do
sin / she should be alwey white as the vessel of silver / that comes fro the
goldsmythe / Right so is the soul when hit comes fro the font of bapteme /
And like as the Vessel that ye saw was in the donge / in like wise is the
soul in the body / which is no thing but donge / and fylthe / For when the
Chaytyf body has sinned by his false delytes. for every sin that he has done
/ there comes a black spot in the soul / And that abides unto the time / that
the body which did the trespass have co^fessid and bewaylyd it in such manner
as he did the deed / and thereof has made satisfaction / And therefore fair
daughter the voys of the vysyon has said. that ye should make you clean and
white like the silver that comes fro the goldsmyth / For when ye come fro the
font of baptesme / after ye ought put it in place. where it should be kept
clean and without or dure / that is to say to keep you fro going in to place
/ where as ye ought absteyne you for to do sin / And keep you well that ye
sin no more / For it is a good thing to be shryuen / but it is better after
the confession to keep him that he fall not again thereto / For the tornyng
again is wors than the first / And when ye should be shryuen / ye ought to say
all / and reteyne no thing behind / And it ought to be said in the manner as
the deed was done / Then my fair douters said the good man / I shall tell
to you an ensample of a bourgeyse a much mighty woman

Of her that deyde. and durst not confess her sin / capo. ixo.
tHere was a woman of great renomme and fame like to be a blessid woman and
charitable / For she fasted three days in the weke / of which she fasted
tweyne to bread and to water / and gafe much almesse^ vysyted the seek /
norysshed the orphans / and was at mass unto mydday And said many orysons and
prayers / And lived an holy life / as a good woman ought to do / And it happed
that she departed out of this world / by whom our lord would show ensample /
how she was lost for one only dedely sin / For the sepulture in which she
was leyd bigan to fume / and smoken / and the earth to brenne^ and there had been
seen on the grave ouermoche torment And the people of the Country merueyled
much / what it mente For they wend verily / that she had be saved above
all other wymmen / Then was there an holy man in the Cite / which took the
cross / the stole / and holy water / and coniured the soul in the name of
god / And requyryd of almighty god / that it plesyd him to show to him /
wherefore this stenche and this tormente was there / Then a voys was herd /
that said / I am the pour synnar. that am dampened to perpetuel fire. For god
shows that my wretchyd body gives out smoke and torment by ensample / And I
shall tell to you / how it has bifalle me by the sin of my flesh / I lay
ones with a Monk / And I durst never confess me thereof / for doubt to be
accused for shame of the world / And I doubted more the bobaunce of the world /
than the spyrytuel vengeance of my sin / I fasted / I gaf for gods sake my
good / I herd masses / and said many orysons and heures / And me seemed the
great good deeds and abstynence that I did quenchyd and estyncted al my sins
/ which I durst not tell ne say to the priest / wherefore I am deceived and
lost / For I tell well unto alle^ that who that dies in dedely sin / and
will not forthynke it. he is dampened perpetuelly / For the sin ought to be
confessid also foully as the dede^ was done / and by the same manner / And when
she had al said / all they that were there present were much abashed / For
there was none / but that he thout she had be saved / And thus said this good
man this ensample to this woman that confessyd her / that she should confess
and tell her sins like as she had done them / and she should put aweye the
spots of the silver vessel / These ben the spots of the soul / And then
this woman confessid her / and lived after an holy lyf^ And thus the beginning
of her sauacion / came of the fastynges^ that she fasted on the friday in
thonoure of the passion of our lord / and the saturday for thonoure of the
vyrgynyte of our blessid lady / By which she was saved from peril / For there
is no good deed done / but it is rewarded / And it is a much holy thing to
fast / And the more pain it does or hurt to the heed or body. so much is
the fasting more of merit / and greter of valewe For if the fasting greuyd not
/ there should thereof be no mede ne merit / and yet for to show an ensample
how fasting is of great merit / It is truth / that the king of Nynyue and
all his Cite were saved thereby / as it is contained in the great book of the
bible / For god had do synken certain Cytees and towns for the great sins
that they delyted in / And god commanded his prophet to tell to this king /
and to the Cite / that if they amended them not / that they should perysshe in
like wise / Then the king and the people of the cite had great dread and fere
/ And for ca^^^ase the ire of god / all they that were of age fasted forty
days and forty nyghtes / and kneled down on her knees / and put sackes on
their hedes in great humylyte. wherefore god took mercy on them / and repeled
his sentence / And so by their mekenes and fasting they were saved / And
therefore my fair daughters / fasting is an abstynence and a virtue much
couenable / which withdraws and restreyneth the flesh from euylle desyres^
And humbles the herte^ and geteth pardon and grace of god And then all young
wymmen / and specially the maidens and wydowes ought to fast / as I have said
here to fore by these ensamples / which by the playsyre of god. ye shall well
reteyne and keep

great curtosye in the time / that he bare arms / than other did for money /

given to the great astates / is but their right / But that which is done unto
small gentylmen and gentyl wymmen and to other of less degree / that honor and
curtosye comen of a fre and a curtoys heart / And the little or pour man or
woman to whom it is done / thinks that he is happy to receive it and has

How the daughters of the king of denmark lost their husbonde by cause of
their manners Capitulo xijo.
Then I would well / that ye had vnderstonden thensample of the daughters of
the king of denmark / which I shall acompte to you / There ben four kings on
this side the sea / that auncyently married for honor without couetyse of
land with daughters of kings and high princes that were well born / and had
good renomme of good manners / of good mayntene and steadfast / And they should be
seen if they were well s^apen and like to bear children / and that they had
such things / as wymmen ought to have / And these ben the four kings / the
king of France / which is the most grettest and noble / the next is the king
of England / the third is the king of spain / and the fourth is the kyng^ of
hongarye / which is by right Marchal of Christian men in werres against the
hethen men and sarasyns / So it happed that the king of England was for to
marye / And he herd say that the king of denmark had three fair daughters
and much well born / And by cause this king was a much wise man / And the
queen a blessid woman and of good life / be sent certain knights and ladies
of the most suffisaunt of his royamme for to see these daughters / And so
passed the sea / and camen in to denmark / when the king and the queen saw the
messagers they had great joy / and honored and fested them four days / and
none knew the truth which of them should be chosen / And they affayted and
arrayed the daughters the best wise they myt / And there was in this company a
knight and a lady rig^ht connyng and much subtyl which took good heed and
set their ententes for to see the manner of these three young ladies and their
contenaunces / and otherwhyle spaken and had comynycacyon with hem / And them
seemed that the oldest was the fairest / but she had not the most sure manner
in her beholding / but often looked here and there^ And turned often her heed on
her sholders / and had her sight ventillous like a vane / The second daughter
had much talkyng and spacke often tofore she understood that which was said to
her / The third was not the fairest of them / but she was most agreeable. and
mayntened her manner more sure and sadly / and spak but litil / and that was
well demeurly. and her regard and sight was more ferme / and humble than of that
other two / and thembassatours took their aduys and cou^ceil that they would
return unto the king their lord / and say to him such thing as they had
fou^den / and then he myt take her that plesid him / Then they came to the
king and queen for to take their l^ue / and thanked them much of their good
company and of thonour that they had done to them / and that they would well
report to their lord such things as they had seen of their douters / upon
which he might do his plaisir. The king then lycencyd them and gaf to them
fair gifts / and so they departed and came in to england And recou^ted to their
lord thonoure that the king and queen had done to them / and after they
reported the beaultes of the daughters / their manners / and mayntenes / and
thus there was enough spoken of each of them / and there were enough that
sustained to take tholdest or the second / for thonour / and that hit were
best to take tholdest / and when all this matter had been well beten and discussed
/ the king which was wise of naturell wit spak of the youngest and said thus

manner / and that has fair mayntene / And there is not in the world so great
ease / as to have a wife sure and steadfast / ne none so great and fair noblesse
/ and therefore I chose the third daughter / For I will have none of the other.
and then he sent for to fetch her / whereof the two older daughters had great
despyte and great desdayne / And thus she that badde the better and the more
sure manner was made queen of England / and tholdest was refused for her wild
lokynge / which was over ventyllous And that other suster by cause she spak

she ansuerd me that she had la^e seen such one / that she would well that he were

answered me nay / but that she would keep him as derworthely as her own body /
and I said to her / that he who someuer he was he was well happy and curous for
to have so sweet and noble a prison / Shall I say to you She louyd him enough

should depart she was a^erte / for she praid me two or three times / that I
should not leave / but come see her how so^euer it went / but I held me al still
/ for I had never seen her to fore / and she wist well that there was spoken of

demanded me what me seemed of her that I had seen / and bad me to tell him mine

never be more nerre her than I am / if it please you / and told to him how me
seemed of her and of her estate / and then he said / that he would not also

her / where of I have thanked god since many times / for it was not after a year

How the daughter of Aragon lost her marriage / Capitulo xiij
I Would that ye should know how the daughter of the king of Aragon lost the
king of spain by her folly / It is contained in the gestys of spain / that a
king of Aragon had two daughters / of whom the king of spain would have one
/ And for to chese her that best plesyd him / he disguysed him self in the
form of a servant / And went with his embassatours / that is to saye^ his
Messagyers / and with a bishop and with two barons / And it is not to be
demanded / but that the king made to them great honor and joy / The
daughters of the king arrayed and attoured them the best wise that they might /
And in especial the oldest / which thought that their coming was for her /
And so they were there in the Court three days for to see and behold the
countenaunces / whereof it happed that in the morning when they salewed them /
the oldest answered no thing but bitwene her teeth / as she that was fyers and
of great port But her suster was humble and full of great curtosye / and
salewed humbly the great and small / After he be^^ld on a time that these two
susters played at tables with two knights. but tholdest chyd with one of the
knights / And demened strongly foul chere. But the younger suster / which had
also lost made no sembla^t of her loss / but made as good chere / as she had
won / The king of spain saw and beheld all this / and drew him a part / and
called his counceylle / and said to them / ye know well that the kings of
france ne of spain ought not to marye them for couetyse but nobly^ and a
woman of good manners well born / and disposed to come to honor / and to bear
fruit / And for as much as I have seen these two damoyselles^ And have
byholden their manners and their guyses / me seems that the youngest is most
humble and most curtois / and is not of so haultayn courage / as is the oldest
/ And they answered to him / Sire tholdest is more fair / And he answered to
them / none honor / ne beaulte. ne none erthely good may compare to bounte ne
to good manners / And in especial to humylyte / And by cause I have seen her the
more humble and the more curtoys / I will have her / And thus chaas her / And
then the bishop and the barons came to the king of Aragon / and demanded of
him the younger daughter / Then the king and all his people were much
esmerueyled that they took not the oldest / which was most fair / But thus
it happed that the younger was queen of spain / by cause she was humble and
soft of speech to greet and small (...) her great curtosye / whereof the
oldest daughter had so great desdayn and so great despit yt she byca^ al
fra^tyke and from her self and therefore this is a fair ensample / how by
curtosye and humylyte is gotten the sone of god and of the world / For there is
no thing so playsaunt as Humblesse curtosye^ and to salewe fair the people
great and small / and to make no chere of loss ne of wynnyng / For no gentyl
wymmen ought to make none effrayes in them / but ought to have gentyl hertes
and soft answers / And to be humble / For as god says in the gospel / he that
is most worth and moos^^ knows / most humbles him / like as did the
younger daughter of Aaragon / which for her humylyte and curtosye con^uerd to
be queen of spain / and took it fro her older suster

wax angry in playeng at tables with a gentylman / which was hoote and hasty
and most Ryotous / And was not right wise / And the debate was of a dies.
which she said was not truly made / And so much it encreaced that words
were enhaunced / and that she said he was a coward and a fool. And so they
left their play by chiding and strif / Then said I to the damoyselle / My
fair Cosyn / Anger you with no thing. that he says / For ye know well / he is
of hau^tayn words and of folissh answers / wherefore I pray you for your honor
that ye take no debate against him / and I told her and cou^ceiled feithfully /
as I would have said to my suster but she would not bileue me / but yet did chide
more after this than to fore / And she said to him that he was naught worth^
and many other words / And he answered to her / that he was better for a man /
than she was for a woman / and she said that he said not troth / and so the
words aroos / that he said if she had been wise and good / she should not come
by night in to the men's chambres / and kiss them and embrace them without
Candell / And she supposed well to have avenged her / and said to him that he
lied / And he said he did not / and that such one and such one had seen it /
And there was much people / that herd hit / which knew no thing thereof to
fore / And many of them said / that a good stylle / and not so to have chyden
had been better for her and that she was beten with her own staf / that is to
say by her tongue / and by her hasty spekyng / And after these words she wept
and said that he had diffamed her / and that it should not be left so And she
reassayled him to fore them all in such wise / that he said yet more foul
and shameful words to the dishonor of her that she shall never recover for
socoure that she can make / And thus was she shamed by the haultesse of her
heart / And therefore this a good ensample / how no woman ought to chyde
nestryne against a fool / ne with people that have haultayn courage / but they
ought teschewe them / For when they see that they will speak grossly and high
/ they should let them alone^ and hold them al still / and say to them /
Fair friend I see well that ye speak hyhe and will ryotte / Now will I leave
you / and so depart and goo fro him / like as a knight did to a lady that I
know / which had an euylle heed / and said many oultrages to the knight to
fore all the peple^ To whom the knight said / Madame if it plesyth you say ye
as many merueyles as ye will / And if I here you / I do you no wrong. I see
well ye be married / whereof I am sorry / But now for all that she would not be
stylle / but chode more than to fore / And when the knight saw / that she
would not leave ne be stylle for no thing / he took a little wyspe of straw
that he fond / And set it to fore her / And said to her Madame / if ye chyde
more / so chyde to this wyspe of straw / / For I leave it here for me / And
went his way / and left her there / and it was reputed for w^l done of the
knight / that so left her / And she was holden for more fool than to fore.
For when she fond not / to whom she might chyde / she restreyned her if she
wolde^ And thus ought hit to be done / For hit is not honest ne good folk to
strive with fools / ne to chydars^ ne to such as have euylle heedes and ben
hasty and hoote / but teschewe them like as the knight did this lady / of whom
ye have herd /

Of her that ete the Eele and plumed her pie / Capitulo / xv /
I Shall tell to you an Ensample hereof upon the fayt of wymmen that ete the
good morsels behind their husbondes / There was a damoyselle that had a pie in
a cag^ which spak and said all that she saw / And it happed that the lord of
the hows made to keep a great Ele in a tronke in a (...) And he kept it much
derworthely for to give it to some good lord of his / or to sum friend / if
they come to see him / And it (...) that the lady said to the Chamberere /
that it were good to ete the great ele / And they thought that they would say
to their lord that thieves had eten him / And when the lord came home (...) began
to tell and say to him / My lady has eten the Ele (...) when the lord herd
this / he went to his ponde / and fond not (...) ele / And came home to his
wife / and demanded her what (...) befallen of his ele / And she supposed to
have excused her / A^^ he said that he was acerteyned thereof / And that the pie
had (...) him / And in the house therefore was great so^owe and noise / But when
the lord was gone out / the lady and the chambere^e came to the pie / and
plucked of all the feathers of his hede^ sa^eng Thou have discovered us of the
ele / and thus was the p^ure p^eplumed and lost the feathers of his head. But
fro than fo^th^n if any man came in to that how / that was balled or pylled or
had an hyhe forhede / the pie would say to them / ye have told my lord of the
ele / And therefore this is a good ensample / that no good woman should not ete
for her lycorousnes the sweet / or dey^^^ morsels without the wytyng of her
husbo^d^ but if she empl^^d it well with honor / This damoysell was after
mo^^e scorned and mocked for that ele by cause of the pie that so often
remembryd (...) to such as came thither so ballyd or pylled

How wymmen ought not to be Ielous. Capitulo / xvj
I Shall say to you an ensample of this evil thing Ialousye There was a
damoyselle married to a s^uyer / which loved so well her husbond that she was
Jealous of all them that he spak to / wherefore her husbond blamed and repreuyd
her often / but it auayled no thynge^ And among al other she was Jealous of a
damoyselle of the Country which was of haultayn courage / And so it happed on
a time / that she did chyde against this damoyselle / And reproched her of her
husbond^ And that other said / that by her faith / s^he said not well ne truth
/ And that other said that she lied / And thus began they to fight and smite /
each other fyersly. And she that was accused took a staf / and smote that
other on the nose such a stroke / that she brack the bone / whereof she had
ever after a crooked nose / which is the most syttyng membre that a man or
woman may have / as it that stondeth in the mids of the vysage / So was this
woman al blemysshed and blamed of her husband / and oftymes reproched / so that
it had been much better for her not to have been Jealous / and to have kept her
vysage hoole without blemysshe / And thus by the dysfyguryng of her nose and
myschaunce / her husbond might not love her so parfytely after / as he did to
fore / as he was woned to do / And other while took other / And thus lost she
the love and thonoure of her husbond by her Ielousye / and her folly / This is
a right good ensample for all good ladies and gentyl wymmen / how they ought to
make semblaunt of such things / and to suffer fair and curtoisly their
sorrow if they have any / Like as did one mine Au^te. which has told it me
many times / This good lady was lady of languyller / which then had a lord
to her husbond. that might well / and held of rent for^ xv^ C. pound a year and
held a merueylous noble estate / but her husbond was lecherous so much / that
he held alwey a woman or tweyne in his house / And oftymes he roos fro his wife /
and went to his concubynes / And when he came fro his folly / he fond a candel
light / and water with a towayll to wesshe his hondes / And when he was come
ageyn she said no thing / but praid him to wesshe his hondes / And he said that
he came from the preuy chambre^ And therefore said she by cause ye come fro thens
/ ye have the more need to wasshe you / And otherwise she repreuyd him not /
But some time she said to him pryuely bitwene them both only / My lord I wot
well and know of your fait with such one and such one / but never for me by
gods grace / since that it is your playsire / And that I can by no mean
remedy it. I shall not make to you the werse chere / ne semblaunt. ne to them
also / For I were well a fool to break my heed for the debate fo your
marchaundise. since it may be none other wise / but I pray you my lord at
lest that ye make me no worse chere / ne that I lose not your love / ne your
good semblaunt / For of the surplus I shall well deporte and forbere / And shall
suffer all that it shall playse you to command me / And truly by the soft
and sweet words that she said to him / his heart malte / and wexe pytous / and
kept him self from it a good while. And during her life by great curtosye and
humble obeysaunce she vaynquyssh^th him / For by other wey / she had never done
it / And at the last he repentyd him / and kept him only to her / This is a
fair ensample / how by curtosye and obeysaunce a woman may best overcome and
withdraw her lord and husbond fro such feet and deeds / and sonner than by
rudesse / For a man is of such courage / that when they be run ^n with
fyersnes and rudesse / they done hit the rather / and ben (...) worse / And for
so much for to say truth / and right / an husbond ought not to conne his
wife maulgre / if she be some what ^^^lons of him / For the wise man says that
Ialousye is (...) of love / And I trow he says sooth / For I should not much
reche of such one / as I set not by / and that I had no cause to love whether
he did well or evil / but of my neighbor or of my friend I should be sorry and
heavy at my heart if he had any harm or disease / And therefore Ielousye is not
without great love / But h^^ is in two manners / of which that one is werse
than that other For it is in sum / in whom ben no good resons / And that is
much better to suffer for his honor and for his estate / than for to have it
/ And also a man ought to conne not ouermoche maulgre to his wife / if she be a
little Ialouse over him / For thereby she shows how her heart doubts and
has great fere / that another have not the love that she ought to have of
right. after god and the church / but she that is wise makes little semblaunt
/ and she ought to refreyne her well / and to bear her evil curtoisly and
conuertly / And in like wise ought a man to make as litell semblaunt as he may
/ It is wisdom to him that may keep him / but alweye the wif that sees that
her husbond be a little Ialouse of her. if she apperceyue that she has caused
it of any folissh plesaunces / which plese him not / the good wif then ought
to deporte and forbere wisely without making semblaunt to fore any / how she
speaks or makes any chere by any were / And ought to say by twene them both
wisely. and the most swetely that she may saying that she knows well / that
the great love that he has to her / has made him to fere and doubt that she
turns not her love awey from him / And to say to him that he have no doubt
ne be not aferd / For by the grace of god she shall keep thonoure well of them
both / And thus by fair and soft words to meue / and take from him and
bring him fro his folissh Melancolye / For if she take it in anger / and have
hyhe words she shall enlumyne the fire and make it werse / and to make it
werse than it was to fore. For many wymmen ben more fyers in their lesynges and
lies / than in their true sayenges and words / And therefore many have great
doubt / And thus I say you that the good wife how well that she have a little
suspection of Ryotte or greef she ought not the less to love her lord and
husbond for a little Ielousye / For she ought to think that is the right great
love that she has to him / And how he has great doubt and fere in his heart
that another have not the loue^ that he ought to have by his right after god
and holy church / And to think and behold / that if another withdraw the
love / that he ought to have / that never he shall love her / and that the love
and the joy of their marriage should be lost / And their good and menage should
torn to declyne and fail fro day to day / And this is a thing / that much
people ought to remember and trxpresse often in their mind / And therefore this is
a good ensample / how the courage and thought ought to be mesured

How a good woman ought not to strive with her husbond / Capitulo / xvij /
aFter this a woman in no manner wise ought strive against her husbond / ne
answer him so that he take thereby displaysyre / like as did the wife of a
burgeys which answered to her husbond so noiously. and shamefully to fore the
people / that he bicam angry and fell to see him self so rewlyd to fore the
people / that he had thereof shame / And he said to her / and bad her ones or
twyes / that she should be stylle and leave / but she would not / and her husbond
which was wroth smote her with his fyste to the erthe^ And smote her with his
foot on the vysage so that he brake her nose / by which she was ever after al
disfygured^ And so by her ryotte and ennoye she gate her a crooked nose much
evil / It had been much better for her^ that she had holden her stylle and
had suffered / yet it is reason and right that the husbonde have the hyhe
words / and it is but honor to a good woman to suffer and hold her in pees
/ and leave the haultayn langage to her husbond and lord / And it is in the
contrary to a woman great shame and vylonye to strive against her husbond be
it wrong or right / And in especial to fore the people / I say not / but when
she shall find him alone and time / but that she may well reprehende him and
advise him in showing curtoysly that he had wrong and unright with him / And if
he be a man reasonable / he shall conne her thank / And if he be other (...)
has not she done but her part / For right so should a wise (...) do / by th
ensample of the wise queen hester / wife of the king Assuere / which was much
melancolyque and hasty / But the (...) lady answered not to his ire / But after
when she sa^^e him (...) attempryd / place / and time / then did she what
she (...) And it was great wysedom of a woman / And thus ought (...) wymmen to
do / By this ensample / the wymmen that been (...) and rampynge ben not of such
obeysaunce / as was a (...) merchant / of whom I shall say and tell to yow^

How a woman sprange upon the table^ Capitulo xv^^^
IN a time it happed that Merchants of France came from certain Fayres /
where as they sought Dra^^er^^ And as they came with Marchaundyse fro Roan /
that one of them said / it is a much fair thing a man to have a wif
obeysaunt in all things to her husbond / Verayly said that one / my wife
obeys me well / And the second said. I trow / that my wife obey me better /
ye said the third / led lay a wager / that which wife of us three that obeys
best her husbond / and does sonnest his commandment that he win the wager
/ whereupon they waged a Iewele / and accorded al three to the same and sworen
that none should aduertyse his wife of this bargayn / sau^ only to say to her /
do that which I shall command what so^euer it be / After when they came to
the first man's hows / he said to his wife Spring in to this bacyne / and she
answered / wherefore or what need is it. And he said by cause it plays^th me so /
and I will that thou do so / Truly said she I shall know first wherefore I shall
spring / And so she would not do it^ And her husbond wax much angry and
fell / and gafe her a buffet / After this they came to the second mrachauntes
hows / and he said to his wife like as that other said / that she would do his
commandment / And it was not long after that he said to her / Spring in to
the basyn / And she demanded him wherefore / And at the last end for ought
that he did / she did it not / wherefore she was beten as that other was /
Then came they to the third man's house And there was the table couered^ and
mete set thereon And the merchant said to the other merchants in their errs /
that after dinner he would command her to spring in to the bacyn / And the
husbond said to his wife / that what someuer he commanded her she should do it /
his wife which that much louyd him and dred him herd well the word. And it was
so that they bygan to ete / and there was no salt upon the table / And the good
man said to his wife / Sail sur table And the good wife which had fere to
disobeye him / sprang upon the table and ouerthrewe table / mete / wyn / and
platers to the ground / How said the good man / is this the manner / Co^ne ye
none other play but this / are ye mad or out of your wit. Sire said she / I
have done your commandment / have ye not said that your commandment should
be done what someuer it was. Certainly I have it done to my power how be it
that it is your harm and hurt as much as mine. For ye said to me that I
should spring on the table / I said he / I said there lacked salt upon the table
/ In good feyth I understood (...) she for to spryng / then was there laughter
ynou and al was taken for a bourd and a mocquerye / Then the other two
Marchaun^^s said it was no need to late her spring in the basyn / For she had
done enough / And that her husbond had won the wager / And she was more
preised than the other two that would not do the commandment of their
husbondes. For moyen people chastysen their wynes by buffettys and strokes / but
gentyl wymmen ought to be chastysed by fair semblaunt and by curtosye (...)
For other wise ought not to be done to them. And therefore every gentyl woman
shows whether she have gentle courage or none That is to wit that she
shows by fair semblaunt and by curtosye that she obeys and has ever
doubt to disobeye / lest any harm come or might happen or fall to her^ For
the other two wives obeyed not their husbondes like as the good wife did to the
thyrdde merchant which for fere of disobeysaunce to her husbond sprange upon
the table / and threw down all / And thus ought every good woman to fere and
obey her lord and husbonde and to do his commandment is hit right or wrong
/ if the commandment be not over outrageous / And if there be vice therein /
she is not to blame / but the blame abyde^h upon her lord and husbonde / And
also that she ought not tansuere to every word of every husbond ne of other /
And that therein is perys^e like as was of the knights daughter / that set
her honor in great balaunce for to strive and answer to the hasty squire
that said to her vylonye as a fool / For many ben so haultayn and of so evil
courage / that they say in hastynesse and hete all that they know and comes
to mouth / Therefore it is great peril to begin strif to such people / For
who so does / he set his honor in great adventure / For many say in their
anger more than they know for to avenge them

Of the woman that gaf the flesh to her honndes / capitulo / x^x
I Shall say to you an Ensample of a lady that yaf the flesh and good morsels
to her little hou^des / There wa^ a lady which had two small hounds / whom
she much loved and had so derworthe that that she took in them greet
playsaunce / She made for them daily dysshes of sowpes / and after gaf to them
flesh and other fryandyses delycyous / And on a time there was a friar
mendy^aunt that said to her that it was evil done to give such metes to the
hounds that were great and fat / where as there were much pour people lene
and dry for ^^gre / Thus he preached unto the lady / but for all that she would
not leave it / S^o then a little afterward this lady bycam seek unto the death /
And there happed a wonder thing / which was seen al apertely. For there came upon
her bed two little black dogs / And when she drew on and was in a trance
they were about her mouth / and lycked her lyppes / And where as they lycked
her on the mouth / it bycam as black as a Cole / This I have herd of a
damoyselle that said that she had seen all this. And named to me the lady / This
is a good en^ample to every good lady and woman / how they ought not to have
over great plais^re in such things / ne to (...) flesh / ne lychorous metes
to the hou^des. For lack of which the pour people of god dye for honger the
which ben the creatures of god made to his semblaunce and lykenes / and ben
his servants / Such wymmen understand not the word of god in the gospel /
where as god says / he that does well to the pour / does to me service / These
wymmen resemble not unto the good queen bla^che / that was mother of saint lowys
which did do give in her sight the mete to the most nedy and meseased. And
after saint lowys did in like wise / For he vysyted the pour people and fed
them with his own hand / The plaisire of every good woman is to see the
faderles and moderles children and little pour children and them norysshe and
clothe / as did the holy lady that was Countess of Mauns which norysshed well
thyrtty orphans / and the little pour children for pity / and therein was al
her disporte / And therefore she was louyd of god / and had an holy life and a
good end / And there was seen at her death a great clerenes and light all full
of little children / These were not the small hounds that were black / which
were seen with the other / as ye have herd to fore

Of them that take first new gyses / capitulo / xx
Fair daughters I pray you that ye ben not the first for to take on you new
arraye ne gyses. and that ye in this caas be the last and tarry lengest / And
in especialle the new gyses of wymmen of strange Country. For I shall say
you of a debate which was f a baronnesse. that duellyd in guyenne / And of the
lord of beaumont fader of him that is now lord / which was a subtyle and a
wise knight / This lady aresonned him of his wife / And said fair Cosyn^ I am
come fro brytayne and have seen my fair Cosyn your wife. which is not arrayed
ne aourned as ben the ladies of guyenne ne of many other places / For her
pourfyls of her garnementes ne of her hodes ben not great enough after the gyse
that now is used / Then the knight answered to her^ Madame sith she is not
arrayed after your gyse / and that her pourfyls seem little / wherefore ye blame
me be ye certain that ye shall blame me no more therefore / For I shall do array
her as queyntely and as nobly as ye or any other ben and yet more / For ye have
not but the half of your garnementes and of your hoode turned outward with grys
and crmynes / but I shall do to her better / For I sha^le make her kirtels
and hoodes all the furre outward / and so she shall be better pourfylled than
ye ne the other / And after this he said / Madame / think ye / that I ne will
well that she be arrayed after the good ladies of the Country / yes verily / but
I will not that she change the guyse of good wymmen / ne of the ladies of
worship of France and of this Country / which use not the gyse of the loves
ne of the lemmans of thenglysshe men / ne of the people of companyes / For these
ben they that first knew this gyse in brytayne and in Guyenne of these great
pourfyls and of the Coursettys turned by the sides / For I was of that time and
saw it / And for to take the guyse of such wymmen that brought it first
hither / I hold them evil counceyled and also them evil aduysed that arraye
them so / and also them that take and use hit / how well that the pryncesse and
other ladies of Englond^ which after their long coming may well do it / But I
have herd of the sages that every good lady and woman ought to keep the gyse
and state of the good ladies and wymmen of their Country and common gyse of the
R^y^^mme / of which they ben of / And that they ben most wise that been the
last that take such noueltees and new gyses / And thus by renomme the ladies
of France and of these low marches ben holden the best ladies that been and
lest blamed These words were said to fore much people / whereof the lady ^^ld
her self nyce / and wist not what to answer / And then many of them bigan to
murmr / and said among them / that she had done better for to have holden her
stylle and said naught / And therefore my fair daughters this is a fair
Ensample for to take and hold astate moyen and the gyse of the good lady^s of
the Country and of the comune of the royamme / that they ben of That is to say
/ of that which the good ladies use comunely and that is a noble thing / For
to take a new gyse comen by strange wymmen and fro other Countrees / they ben
more mocqued / and scorned / than for to keep the gyse of their Country / as ye
have herd of the good knight that was wise / and of great government in
repreuyng of the lady / And know ye for certain / that they that first done
and take the new gyses / ben scorned and mocked / But god have mercy on us at
this day / after that some have herd that any new facion or nouelte of goune or
arraye / shall never rest till they have thereof a Copye / And shullen say to
their lord or husbond daily / Such thing / and such should become me well / and
it is right fair / I pray you that I may have it / if their lord or husbond
say to her / my love if such one have it / other that been holden as wise as
she have it not / And she then will say what though they can not array them
/ what have I do with all / Since that such one has it. I may well have it /
and were it as well as she / And I say you that they shall find so many resons /
that they must needs have their part / but these manner of wymmen ben not
found the most wise ne most connyng / but they have their heart most set
to the plesaunce of the world / I speak not upon the ladies ne the damoysels
that may well do at their lust and gyse / For against their estate I thynk not
to speak any thing that may displese them if I may know it / For it
apperteyneth not / ne is syttyng to me but to honor and obey them to my
powere / ne I entende not to speak against them by this book / but to my own
daughters / wymmen and servants / to whom I may say that as it shall plese
me. and after my will

How me ought not to strive against them that been langageurs and full of words
/ Capitulo xxi
Fair daughters I shall say to you an Ensample / how it is peryllous to speak
and hold stryf to people that have the world in their hand / and that have
manner and wit to speak. For gladly men ne win but little to hold stryf of
bourdes and Iapes to such men / For it happed at a great feste where as were
many great ladies and lords / And that there was the marchal of Clermo^t /
which merueiloussly had the world in hand as of fair spekyng and lyeng
subtylly / and to know him self and his being among all knights and ladies /
So then there was one lady that said to hym^ to fore all the people / Clermont
/ in good faith ye ought to give great guerdon unto god / For ye be a good
knight and semely enough. and ye know many and conne many merueyles. and were
parfite enough / if your mockyng ne were and your evil tongue. which sometime
can not be stylle / Now Madame is this the worst tatche that I have / She said
ye / Now see we then in this point as me seems for to Judge rightfully / that
I have not so euylle a tongue as ye / And I shall say you wherefore / ye have
me repreuyd and told me the worst tatche that I have after your aduys / And I
have not said the worst tatche that I know in you / what wrong have I do
then / Madame I am not so swyfte of my speech as ye are / The lady held her
pees then / And would that she had not stryuen ne spoken to him for diverse
causes / which I reherce not^ as I have herd recounted that it was enough
spoken / And sum said that it had better for her to have been stylle / And
therefore this is a good Ensample / For it is better sometime to be stylle and
say no thing than to be over apperte and begin woedes to such men / as have
their words ready at hand / And that have no shame to say double words having
diverse ententes / And therefore take ye heed to whom ye enterprise to speak /
and beware that ye say no thing to their displaisire / For for to strive is
much peryllous

Of thee ladies that ar^sonned Boussycault. capitulo / xxijo
yEt shall I say to you of this matere / how it happed that three ladies
supposed to have shamed Boussycault And what fylle thereof / Boussycault was a
wise man / and well bespoken among all other knights / And had the world
and rule at the will among great lords and ladies. So it happed at a feste
that three great ladies satte in a Closette / and spaken of their good auentures
so long / that that one said to the other / Foull^ all to her of us / that will
not say for good company if she were this year praid and required of love /
verily seid one of them / I have been desired within this year / by my feyth
seid ye other so have I / and I also said the third / Now said one that was
most peert / Foul be she that will not discouere his name / that last
desired us / By my feyth said one / if ye will ensure us to say the same also
/ we shall say truly the treuthe. And she agreed and said that it was
boussycault / ye said that other. certeynly it was he that desired me /
Certainly so did be me said the thirdde / Ha Ha said they is hit so /
Certeynly he is not so loyal ne true as we had supposed / He is not but a
bourdour / and a deceyuer of ladies / late us send for him / And anon ^e was
fette / and came / and said to them My ladies what pleseth you / they said we
have for to speak with you / Sytte here down by us / And would have made him
sytte at their feet. but he answered them and said. Since I am comen at your
sendyng fore / late me have a chayer or a stool to sytte on / For if I should
sytte low I might break my points or layners^ and ye might bear me on hond
that it were another thing. And so he must have a syege to sytt on / And when
he was set / the ladies that were well born began to say to him / how is hit
Boussycault^ that we have been deceived by you in time passed^ For we had
supposed that ye had been feith full and true / And ye are not but a trompeur
and a mockar of ladyes^ It is al your condition / how said boussicault my
ladies know ye that I have done any deceyte or tromperye / yes said that one.
For ye have desired my fair Cosyns / that been here / and also so have ye me /
And ye have sworen to each of us that ye louyd each best above al creatures /
this is a great lesyng / and it is not truth / For ye be not worthy ne of
valewe to have three. And therefore ye ben falls and deceyuable. And ye ought not
to be putt in the nombre ne in thacounte of good and true knights / Now my
ladies have ye al said / ye have great unright / and I shall tell you wherefore
/ For at the time that I said so to each of you / I had then my plesaunce /
And thought so at that time. And therefore ye do wrong to hold me for a
deceyuer / But me behooves to suffer of you / For ye have your parlementes
upon me / And when they saw that he was not abashed / they bygan to say /
what shall we do / late us draw lotte for him / and she that has the
shortest shall have him / For if I lose / I shall quyte my part truly / And I
mine said the other / Then answered he and said to them / nay my ladies / by
the sacrament of god / I am not so to be departed ne to be left / For there is
here no woman that I will abide with / And therewith he aroos and went his way
And they aboden in the shame more abashed than he was / And therefore it is
great peril to begin strif or debate with men that know the world / and
that can mayntene their manner And therefore this is a good Ensample not for to
strive ne to have words with such manner men / For in all thing is manner For
other while they that wene to know most / ben sometime deceived / And therefore
I would that ye should remember an Ensample semblable to this matere

Of three ladies that accuseden one knight / capitulo / xxiij
IT was so on a time that three badyes accuseden a knight of such a caas and of
such a deceyuau^ce / And had shitte him in a chamber alone / and every lady
had a damoyselle / And that notwithstondyng they iuged him to death / saying
that he never after should deceive in such manner lady / woman / ne maid /
And they were so angry and wroth toward him / that each of them held a knyf to
slay him / And then he said to them My ladies sith it pleseth you / that I
shall dye without remedy and without mercy / I pray you all that it plese
you to grant me a bone and a yefte / And they acorded and granted it (...)
And then said he / wit ye what ye have granted / and there (...) nay / but
ye say it to us / I desire then said he that the strongest hoar of you smite
me the first stroke / Then were they al abass^^^ and each of them beheld
other / and eueriche thought in him self (...) should smite the first stroke /
I should be dishonored and (...) when he saw them so astonyed and esbayed /
he ran to the (...) opened it / and went out / and so departed fro them / and
thus the (...) saved him self / and they abode all astonyed and mocked / and
therefore (...) little aduysement is much worth at need / be it to man or woman
Then I leave to speak more of this matere / And come ag^^ne to speak of them
that have their heart all on the world as to be (...) feestes / Ioustes and
carolles and to goo on pilgremages more for disporte than for devotion

Of them that gladly go to festes and Ioustes capitulo xxiiij
I Shall say to you an Ensample of a good lady that ga^ a great blame at a
great feste of a round table at Ioustes^ This good lady was young. And her
heart was set to the world for to dance and sing well. whefore the lords and
knights loved her wel^ Not withstondyng her lord her husbond was no thing
plesid that she went so gladly / but she often p^^ide and required him to give
her leave / And her husbonde did so for fere to stand out of the grace of
other lords / And by cause they should not say / that he were not Jealous /
And he him self also spente largely for to acqueynte him at the feestes / And
for the honor of them both / But she might well apperceyue / that if she had
would don the playsir^ and will of her husbond / that she should not have gone
thither / Hit happed on a time as she was acustomed to dance in a feste all
night till hit was day / that suddenly the torches and lyghtes were al quenchid
/ And there was made great hues and cries / and when the light was brought
ageyne^ the brother of the husbond of this lady saw that a lord a knight held
this lady / and had put her a little a part or a side / And in good feithe / I
think verily / that there was done then none harm / ne vylonye / But
nevertheless the brother said so much that her husbond knew there of / And he
had so great sorrow in his heart thereof / that he mystruste her all his life
after^ ne never had sith that time to her so great love ne playsaunce / as he
was woned to have / For he was a fool / and so was she also / And ever after
each arred at other like hounds. And they lost all their goods and household.
And all for a little occasion / I know well also another fair lady / that much
gladly would be led to the feestes / And was therefore blamed and sklaundred
with a great lord wherefore she took a thought and bycam seek a long time of
so great a sekenes / that she she was all deffeted / And had no thing on her /
but skyn and bone And began to draw toward her death / wherefore the sacrament
was brought to her / Then said she to fore all that were there / My lords
and my friends / behold and see / In what point I am / I was wont to be white
/ Rody / fat / and the world preysed my beauty / Now may ye see what I am /
I am not like as I was w^ned to be / I was acustomed to love festes / Ioustes
and torneyes but the time is passid / me behooves to goo to therthe that I came
fro / And also my right dear friends / it is said and much spoken of me and of
my lord of Craon / But by that god that I owe to receive / and on the
dampnacion of my soul / he never required me of vylonye / ne never did to me
more / than the fader that engendryd me / I say not but that he lay in my bed /
but that was with out vylonye or thynkyng of any evil / Then were there
much people abashed that supposed well / it had been all otherwise / Not
withstondynge yet had she be sklaundred and blamed therefore a fore time / and
her honor hurt / And for these things it is great peril to all good
ladies that have their hertes ouermoche set on the world^ ne be over desirous
to goo to such feestes / that they may keep them honorably / The feestes and
reuelles ben cause of which many good ladies and gentyl women get much blame
and noise without cause / And nevertheless I say not but that they must sometime
obey their husbondes and their friends / and go thither / B^t my daughters if
it happen that ye goo / And that ye may not refuse it goodly / when it comes
to night that they shall dance and sing / so keep you that for the speech of
the world / ye have alwey by you sum of your friends or of your ^eru^untes
/ For if it so happed / that the torches or light were auenchyd and put out /
that they might abide by you / not for ^^^tyng of any evil / but for the
peril of evil eyes / and of (...) tongues / that alweye espy / and seye more
harm than there is / And also for more surely to keep your honor / your
name and your good fame. against liars / that will alwey say the euylle and
leave the good

Of them that will not were their good clothes on high ^estes and holy days
/ capitulo / xxv
aN other ensample I shall tell you of them that will not were their gounes
ne clothes on hyhe fest^s and on sondayes for the honor of our lord / Then
I w^^l^ that ye should take ensample how a damoyselle repreuyd her l^dy There
was a lady / which had good gounes and rich / but she would not were them on
sondayes / ne on fe^tful days / but if she supposed to find there noble men
of estate / So it happed at a fe^te of our lady. which was on a sunday / that
her damoysell said to her Madame why clothe ye not with your good gown this
day for the love of our lady / and of the sunday / I said she / for I se no
men of estate here / a ha said the damoysell / god and his mother ben more great
than any other / And they ought to be honored more than any worldly thing /
For he may give and take awey all things at his plaisire / For all good and
all honor comes of him and of his blessid dear mother / and on their holy
da^es we ought to arraye us the better / hold your pees said the lady / God
and the priest and the people see me al day / but folk of estate see me not al
wey / and therefore it is gretter honor to me to ara^ and make me fresshe for
them / Madame said the damoisel that is eu^l said / It is not said the lady /
late come all that may come thereof Anon with that word there came a wind all
hoote. and smote her in such wise that she might not stxre ne remeue / more
than a stone / And then she confessid her and repentyd / and auowed to many
pylgremages / And was carried in a lytyer / And she told to al men of worship
that she fond the cause of this maladye that had so taken her / And that it
was the vengeance of god / And she said that she had more great joy and
gretter playsyre for to make her queynt and gaye for people of estate that came
from without forth in to such a place where as she was for to playse them and
to have part of their beholdynges / than she did for any devotion at the hyhe
festes of our lord. ne of his saints / And sith she said to gentle wymmen.
where as she arrayed her / My loves / loo see here the vengeance of god / And
told to them all the fayt And said to them / I was woned to have a fair
body and gente / And so said every man of me / And for the preysyng the
bobaunce and the glory that I took / I clad me with rich clothes and fyn well
pourfyld and furryd^ And showed them at festes and Iustes / For sometime the
fruit that was in me^ was nout and folly / and all that I did was for the
glory and loos of the world / And when I herd say of the company / that
said for to please me / loo there is a well bodyed woman ^ which is well worthy
to be bilouyd of sum knight / Then al my heart reioysed in me / Now may ye
see what I am / For I am now gretter than a pype. And am not like as I was / ne
the gowns ne robes that I loved / and had so dear. that I would not were them
on so^dayes ne on the feestes for thonoure of god shall now never serve me /
And therefore my fair loves and friends / god has showed to me my folly / that
spared mine array on holy days for to show me fresshe and Ioly to fore men of
astate for to have preysyng and beholding of them / wherefore I pray you my
friends / that ye take ensample here at me / Thus co^playned this good lady al
seek and swollen / vij / year / And after when god had seen her contricion and
her repentance / he sent to her health / and was hoole after her life / and
was ever after much humble^ toward god / And gafe the most part of her
goods for gods sake / and held her afterward symply and had not her heart
set toward the world / as she was woned / and therefore my fair daughters this is
a good ensample hou ye ought to apparayle yow^ and were your good clothes on
the sondayes / and the good feestes for thonoure and the love of god which
gives all / And for thonoure of his sweet mother and of the holy saints more
than for worldly people / which ben no thing but fylthe / and earth / And for
their regard and preysyng / For they that so done for their plaisaunce
displese god / And he shall take vengeance on them in this world / or in that
other / like as he did of the lady of which ye have herd / And therefore this
is a good Ensample to all good ladies and to all good wymmen

Of the suster of saint Bernard which came to see him in great array Capitulo
xxvj
oNe Ensample. will I tell you after this matere / It happed that saint
bernard which was an holy man / and of hyhe lygnage left all his great
possessions / and noblesse for to serve god in an Abbaye and to lead the better
his life / he was chosen Abbot^ and ware hayer and did great abscynence / and
was a great alms man to the pour / And he had a su^ter which was a great
lady / and she came for to see him with great foyson of people nobly arrayed with
rich robes set with perles and precious stones / and in this great estate she
came to fore her brother which was a good and holy man / And when saint Bernard
saw her in this array / he blessid him / and turned to her his back / And the
lady was gretely abashed by cause he deyned not to speak to her / and he sent
her word that he was aferd to see her in so great pride / and so desguysed and
deffaited / Then she did of her rich atours and rich robes / and arrayed
her much symply / and then he came to her and said / fair suster. if I love
your body I owe by reason much more to love your soul / Wene ye not that it
displesyth god and his saints and to all the Court of heaven to see such
pride and bobau^ce set vp^ And to array karoyn / that within a day after the
soul shall depart shall so rote and stynke / that no creature may feel ne
see it without error and abhomynacion / Fair suster / why think not ye ones
a day / how the pour dye for cold / and for hongre there without / where as
the tenthe part of your queynteryes and noblesses might refresshe and clothe
moo than xl persons against the cold. Then this holy man declared to her
hou she should leave the folly of the world^ and the bobaunce thereof / and showed
to her how she should save her soul so much that the good lady wept / And
after she did do selle the most part of her rich Roobes and rich array /
And led so holy a life / that she had the grace of god and of the world /
that is to say of good and wise men / which ben better than fooles^ And
therefore my fair daughters this is a fair Ensample that ye ought not have your
heart set toward the world / ne to find and set these new gyses and
queyntyses to please with the world. but that ye depart so with god / which
all sends / And so may ye get your sauacion / For it is better to have
less gowns and robes / that the pour may have their part / For who someuer
let all his intent for to have the playsyr of the world / I am certain that
it is folly and temptacion of the fend onre enemy / And ye ought more better
to array you for the love and honor of god / than for the folysshe thought of
the world which is but a shadow unto the regard of him that all may and al
gives / and alwey endures his glory /

Of them that play and iape at the mass / capitulo / xxvij
I Shall tell you another Ensample of them that Iangle at the masse^ when
they ought to here the seruyse of god / It is contained in the gestys of
Athenes / that there was an heremyte a much holy man and of blessid life / And
he had a Chapel in his hermytage of saint Johan / And thither came many knights
/ squyers ladies and damoysels of the Country / as well for the feste / as for
the holiness of him / And this holy heremyte song the mass. And when he
turned him after the gospel / he beheld the ladies and damoisels / knytes and
squyers / that bourded and iangled in the time of the mass and ronned one with
another / And he beheld much their contenaunce / And he saw that at each ere
of man and woman was a fend much black and horrible / which also laughed and
Iangled among them / and wrote the words that were said / These fendes wenten
spryngyng upon their queynt arayement / and nyce array like as the small
birds that lepe fro brau^che to brau^che / And this holy man blessid him and
merueyled / And when he was in his canon about the end he herd them speak and
laughe / And then he smote the book for to make them be stylle / but sum
there were that would not / Then said he / fair lord god make thou them to
hold their pees / and be still / and that they may know their folly / Then
they that so laughed / bigan to cry and braye / both men and wymmen as
demonyakes and suffryng so great pain. that it was a pytous thing to see and
here And when the mass was songen / the holy heremyte said / hou (...) had
seen the fendes of hell laugh upon them with evil contenaunces when he was at
the mass / And after he told them that they fylle in great peril when they
spak and bourded / and of the great sin that they did in the time of the
mass / when they should have been in the seruyse of god / To which none ought
to come / but for to give laud / pray humbly and deuoutely to worship god /
And after this he said / how he saw the fendes lepe and spring upon the
horns / and other nyce apparaylle of many wymmen / And they were tho that
talked and Iangled with company And they that thought more to complaire and
plese their amorettes and delytes of the world / than to plese god / and to
have the regardes and beholdynges of the musardes / on them / he saw on these
the fendes pynne their keuerchyefs / but upon them yt said their prayers and
were in deuocio^ / they were not on them ne touched the^ how well there were
enough of them / that were well arrayed and curyously / But it holds more in
the heart than in thabyte / And after he said that so arrayed them for to ben
the beter seen / and take heed of^ done great sin / And they that take
playsir in the seruyse of god / anger sore and given great debate to the fend
our enemy / After that he had said thus many things / the wymmen and they
that cried and were so tormented / threw awey their gaye arraye / as people
out of their wit / And alweye abode they there in such manner nine days /
And on the tenthe day they were brought again to their right mind / by the
prayer of the holy heremyte^ And thus were they chastised / that fro than
forthon / they kept them from spekyng and Ianglyng in thetyme of the service
of god / wherefore we may well understand by this ensample that no person ought
not talk in the church ne distourble the seruyse of god

An Ensample that happed at the mass of saint Martyn capitulo / xxviij
aNd yet I shall say to you what befelle at the mass of saint Martyn of
Tours / The holy man song the mass And his godsone saint Bryce help him to
sing which was after him Archebisshop of Tours / This saint Bryce began to
laughe / And saint Martyn apperceyued it / And when the mass was done / saint
Martyn called him / And demanded of him why he laughed / And he answered him
that he had seen the devil / which put in writing / all that the men and
wymmen talked to geder as long as he said the mass / Then it happed / that
the parchemyn in which the fend wrote / was over short / And he began to
draw it out a long with his teeth. for to make it larger / And when he so
drewhe with his teeth / the perchemyn escaped fro him / in such wise that he
smote his heed against the stone wall / And for that cause I lough / And when
saint Martyn had herd that saint Bryce had seen this / he preched up on this
matter to the people / how it was great peril to speak and talk in the mass
time / and in the time of the service of god / And yet sustain the great
clerks that me ought not say no prayers in the mass time / And in especial
while the gospel is red and per omnia with the preface / And for these causes
aforsaid my fair daughters / ye have herby a fair ensample / how that ye out
to mayntene you humbly and deuoutely in the Church / and not to talk ne
iangle for no thing that may happen

Of a knight that causid all a town to lose their mass where as he dwelled /
capitulo xxixo.
aNother Ensample I shall tell you of them that lose their mass / and also
to make other to lose it / I have herd told of a knight and of a lady / that
fro their youth took great plaisire to sleep to fore none. And this they used
in such manner that oftymes they lost their mass / And causid all they
parysshe to lose it also / in which they dwelled / For he was lord and patron
of the parysshe / And the parson durst not with say him / So it happed on a
sunday / that they sent to the parson that he should tarry for them / And when
they came / it was passed mydday / And they of the parysshe told the priest that
it was past none / And therefore he durst not sing mass / And so they had no
mass that day / wherefore the people of the parysshe were much angry / but
they must needs suffer / And it happed in the same night that the priest had a
vysyon / that him seemed / that he kept a great flock of sheep. in a field /
where as was no grass / And he wol^d have brought them in a pasture for to
have fed them / where to was but one path / and in that path was a black swyn
and a sow / which lay ouerthwert the way / And these hogg^s were horned / And
he had so great dread and fere / both he / and his sheep. that he durst not
enter in to his pasture / And anon they turned back to their feld without
pasture / And so they had no mete / And then him thought one said to him /
leuest thou to give pasture to thy sheep / for fere of these horned beestes /
and there with all he awoke / And in like wise this vysion happed the same night
to the knight and to the lady his wyfe^ for them seemed that they become a bore
and a sow / and were also horned / And that they would not suffer the sheep to
pass and goo to their pasture / And since them seemed / there came a great chase
of black hunters syttyng upon great black horses / which had with them great
qua^tyte of grehoundes and black dogs / whom them seemed. they uncoupled /
and did set them on hem / and made them all to draw hem / and byte them by
the eres / arms / and thyes / And blewe their horns / hallowed and cried / And
this chase or hutyng endured on them so long / that them seemed that they were
taken and slain / and there with all they awoke being sore aghast and effrayed /
and this aduysion happed and came to them two times / Now it happed that the
priest came unto the place / where this knight and lady were / And they told to
him their vysyon / And in like wise the priest told to them his / whereof they
were sore admerueyled and abashed by cause they were like / Then the priest
aduysed him / and said to the knight / Sire there is an holy hermyte here by
in such a foreste / which shall make us wise and under stand of this thing
/ Then they went to this holy man / and recounted to him their aduysyon /
fro point to point / And this holy man which was wise and of a blessid life /
declared to them all their fait / And said to the knight and his wyf^ ye be the
black swyne / which keep the pathe and the enter of the pasture. that the
sheep may not feed them / ne may not ete of the good pasture That is to say
that ye be lord of the parysshe / in which ye dwell And ye have distourbled
and let the good people and parisshens for to lere the seruyse of god / which
is good pasture and refresshyng of the spyrituel life of the soul / by cause of
your latchesse and your long rest / And the horns that ye have been the
branches of your sins / which ben much great / And in especial of the
great sins that ye have done in lettyng other fro the benefete and the
service of god / which ye may not amend but by greet penance and tormente /
And therefore the vengeance of the wrong that ye have done / is showed to you /
that ye shall be tormentyd and hu^nted of the fendes of hell / And at the last
ye shall be taken and slain by the very huntyng of deuyls / like as it was
showed to you by your aduysyon / And I say you certainly. that it had been
less sin an honderd against one / that ye had herd no mass than for to
take fro the good people ne fro the priest their devotion / for when he abode
over long / he was angry and sinned in the sin of wrath / and the good people
also / of whom sum went to tavern / And other lost their devotion and all
good charity / And all the sins and euyls comen of you / and by your slouthe
/ whereof ye shall give a rekenyng perauenter has^lyer than ye wene / For ye
shall be hunted and put to does like as ye have seen in your aduysyon / That
is to say that ye ben in the wey to be dampened / if ye put not thereto remedy /
Then the knight was much abashed / and demanded of him cou^ceil how he
might do / Then the holy man said that he should three sondayes kne^e to fore
his parisshens / and cry them mercy / and pray them to pardone him / And that
they would pray to god for him and his wife also / And from then forthon they
would be the first to fore other at the Church / and there he confessid him to
the heremyte / And he gafe to him that penance and other / And fro than
forthon he chastysed him self / And he and his wife thanked our lord / that he
vouchesauf to show to them this demonstrau^ce / And I say you that fro than
forthon / they were the first that came to the church / And also the holy
heremyte said to the priest and declared to him his vision. and told him that
god ought to be more drad and served than the world. And therefore my fair
daughters / take herby a good ensample / that for your plaisire ye cause none
to lose their mass / ne their devotion for your slouthe and neclygence / For
it were better that ye herd none / And I would well / that ye should know and
learn thensample of a lady / that spended the fourth part of the day for to
array her /

Of a lady that dispended the fourth part of the day for to array her /
capitulo / xxx
There was a lady / which had her lodgyng by the church / And she was alweye
acustomed for to be long to array her / And to make her fresshe and gay / in so
much that it annoyed and grieved much the parson of the Church / and the
parysshens / And it happed on a sunday that she was so long / that she sent to
the priest / that he should tarry for her / like as she had been acustomed^ And
it was then ferforthe on the day / And it annoyed the people / And there were
sum that said. how is ^it / shall not this lady this day be pynned ne well
besene in a Myrroure / And sum said softely. god send to her an evil sight.
in her myrroure that causes us this day ^ and so oftymes to muse and to abide
for her. and then as it plesyd god for an ensample. as she looked in the
Myrroure she saw therein the fend / which showed to her his hinder part so
foul and horrible / that the lady went out of her wit / and was al
ce^onyak a long time / and after god sent to her health / And after she was
not so long in arayeng but thanked god that had so suffered her to be chastysed
/ And therefore this is a good ensample / how me ought not to be so long / for
to apparayle ne to make her gaye / as for to lose the seruyse of the mass. ne
to make other to lose the service of god

How god sprange in to the mouth of a holy lady / capo. / xxxjo.
nOw I shall tell you upon this matere of a good lady which was holy of life
/ and much loved god and his seruyse / And that day that she herd no mass /
she ere neither flesh ne fysshe. so evil at ease was she at her heart / So
it happed on a time / that her chappellayn was in such wise seek / that he
might not sing mass / The good lady was not well at ease at her heart / by
cause she had lost her seruyse / And walked out of her Castle saying / O good
lord / forgete us not / but plese hit the to pourueye to us that we may here
the holy service / and in saying these words / she saw two freres of relygyon
coming / of whom she had great joy / And anon she demanded if they had said
mass / And they said nay / And she desired them to sing / And they said
gladly / if it please god / And when the good lady herd that she thanked god /
And the younger song first / And then when he had made three pyeces of the
sacrament / the old friar beheld it. And saw one of the parts spryng in to
the mouth of the good lady / in manner of a little bright clerenes / The young
friar looked all about / where hit was become / And that other trembled for
fere and sorrow of his felawe / And came to him and said that he should not be
dismayed / For that he sought was in the mouth of the good lady^ Then was he
well assured and thanked god of the miracle that thus happed to this good lady /
that so much louyd the seruyse of god / Loo my fair doughters^ this is a good
ensample for you certain / They that love god in his seruyse / god loves them
/ as it is showed appertely / by this good lady / which had so great desire to
see him and here his seruyse as before is said /

Of a Countess that every day herd three masses / capitulo / xxxij /
I Would that ye should well reteyne an ensample of a good lady / a Countess /
which every day would here three masses / And on a time she went a pylgremage^
And hit happed of her Chappellayns to fall of an horse to therthe / so that he
was so hurt that he might not say mass / The lady was at over a great
meschyef for to lose one of her masses / And she complained deuoutely to god /
And anon god sent to her an Angel instead of a priest / which song the
third mass / but when he had songen / and was vnreuested / it was not known
where he bicam for any search that they couthe make. Then thought the good
lady / that god had sent him to her / And thanked him much humbly / and
this is a fair Ensample how god purueyeth to them that have devotion in him /
and in his service / But I trow that there ben many ladies at this day / that
pass well with less than three masses / For it suffyseth them ynowe of one
mass only / so lyte^l love and devotion / have they in god / and in his
service / For in herynge of his seruyse his propte person fond him / For who
someuer loves and dredeth him / he will often see him and here his holy word /
And in like wise the contrary / For he that has not well set his heart to him
ward / he passes lyghtely as many do in thise days / which have their heart
more set on the world / and on the delight of the flesh / than on god.

Of a young amorouse lady / and of an esquyer / Capitulo / xxxiij
I Shall tell to you an Ensample of a young lady. which had set her heart on
the world / And unto her repaired a squire / which was Ioly and amourous on
her / And she ne hated him not / And more for to have ease and delight for to
speak and bourde to geder / she made her lord and husbond to bileue that she
had auowed to go a pylgremage / and her husbond which was a good man suffered
her by cause he would not displease her / and so it happed on a time that she
and this squire went a pylgremage unto a monastery of our lady / And they were
in great plaisire on the way for to speak to geder / For they intended well
other things than to say their matyns / And they had great playsyre and
delight on the wey / whereof it happed that when they were comen in to the
church / and were in the myddel of the mass / the foul fend / which is
alwey in a wait tenflamme and tempte man and woman / held them so subget in
this temptacion and foul plaisire / that they had their eyes and plesaunces
more to behold each other / and to make small signs and tokenes of love than
they bad in the dyuyne seruyse / or for to say deuoutely their prayers / And
so it happed by open miracle / that so great a maladye took the said lady /
that suddenly she swouned / And they knew not whether she was deed or a live /
And so she was born thennes in men's arms in to the town / as a deed body /
And her husbonde and friends were sent fore / which were much sorrowful of

which thou have taken thyn noreture love and honor thy husbond. like as thou

holy mouth / that a man should leave fader and mother / suster and brother / and
abide with his wife and with wife her husbonde / and that they be not tweyne but
one flessh / and yt god has joined man may not depart / and also where he
said that your mother said / ye took your noreture in her pappes and your
welthe / that is to say / if ye love your husbond above al other / then
shall your noreture grow and encrece from day to day / like as the child
grows by his noreture of the pappe and by the s^ettenes of the milk / which

fall in the pit with great hete / that thou shall be lost therein / that is to
say / that if thou love more another than thy lord / thou shall fall in to the
pyt / where ye shall be brent and broiled for the delight of evil plaisau^ce and
evil hete / And therefore he showed to you the pytte of fire and of hete / And
the vengeance and the pugnycion that behooves to ensue for this delight and the
hete of the folissh plaisau^ce. After he showed to you the prestes in white /
and said that ye had reuested them / whereof he thanked you / that signefia^ce
is / that ye have (...) reuestid prestes / and done said masses for them / and
in like manner pray they for you^ and they ben sorry when they see them that done
good for them ben sent to perdicio^ / as ye may well apperceyue that they were
sorry of the te^ptacion that ye had in the foul plaisau^ce / in which ye were
in the wey for to be lost / and therefore they came for to socour you for love of
the good deeds of the masses and almesses that ye have done for them / After ye
saw thymage of our lady that held a cote and a shirte / and said this cote and
this shirt have kept the fro falling in to the pytte / for thou have defouled
my house and mocked it / That is to say that ye have been in the chirch in
gretter love of another / than of him / They were the folisshe regardes and the
folisshe plaisires yt ye took him / for whom ye emprised and took the Iourneye:
and also the vois said to you ye have fouled and mocked his haus yt is his
chirch For all they that come thither for any other playsaunce / but for the
devotion of holy place / and do not the seruyse of god / but come for their
plaisire and worldly delight / they mock the church and the hows of god /
After ye defowled it when ye sinned there like as the voys said to you. that
was when ye had your heart set more in the plaisire of folly / than on the
dyuyne seruyse / And of that trespass god has wylled to show to you your
defaulte / And has sent to you this great euylle and sekenes / that ye have
now felt / And this grace and chastysement is comen to you for the seruyse and
good deed that ye did to two pour wymmen / of which ye gaf to one a Cote /
and to that other a smok And the voys said to you / that the Cote and smock
have kept you fro falling in to the pytte / that is to say that the good deed
and thalmesse that ye have done for gods sake have kept you fro perysshynge /
For if ye had fallen in to the folly and foul playsyre^ where ye had set
your heart in / ye had been utterly lost and perysshed / wherefore ye ought to
give great thankyng and seruyse to god / that he has vouchedsauf to show you
your error Now ought ye from hens forth to keep you from falling in such
peril / as for to lose all honor and your soul / and not to have plaisire
to love none so much as your lord your husbond to whom ye have promised
feith and truth / and ye ought not to change for better ne werse / And if
she change and love an other / than she lies and perjured her feithe and
truth / Now have ye here god be thanked a fair myroure all like as the wise
man showed you the aduysyon / And thus he confessid and taut her the best wise
he couthe^ and the lady wexed al hole / and thanked god and left all her
folysshe plaisaunce / Then it happed about half year after / that the squire
that loved her peramours came from a vyage / and from an armee where he had been
/ And came to her queynt and Iolye / And began to bourde and iape / and speak
such langage as he had to fore other times used / And he fond her all
strange / then was he all abashed and admerueyled / And demanded her and
said / Madame at what play have I lost the good time / the life and the hope /
that I have had to live with you Ioiously / And she answered to him that all
that time was passid / For never as long as I live said she I purpose to love
ne have plaisaunce thith none^ sauf with my lord my husbonde / And then she
told to him the adventure that happed her in the chirch^ And he thought and
supposed well to have turned her / but he might not / and when he saw that she
was feeme and constaunt / he left her / And after said / and told to many
other the constaunce and stedfastnes of her / whereof he much preysed and
honored her the more / And therefore here is a good Ensample / how me ought not
to goo to holy pylgremages for no foolysshe playsaunces / but only for the
dyuyne seruyse and for the love of god / And how good it is for to pray / and
to do say masses for the souls of fader / mother and other friends / For in
like wise they pray and empetre grace for them that been alive that remember
them / and do good for them as ye have herd / And also it is good to give
alms for gods sake / for the almesses geten grace of god to them / that give

a procession was made for to pray god for them / And so about the eueuyng of

nedeful and right it was that the Church should be new holowed / And that the
said perrot for his penance should goo al about the Church al naked on three

he was found within the Church lyeng upon a woman in great distress and hard
empesshed. For so nyghe they touched and joined one to other that they might
not depart nor styre one fro other / but both at ones. And in such manner
and point they were so long that all the monks came thither or they were
losed^ And when the pour Monk saw his uncle and all the other monks with him
/ he had great shame and great sorrow in his heart / And for this cause and
mesehyef left he that Abbeye / and went in another somwhere / Here may be
taken great Ensample / how men ought well to keep them self fro sin doing in
holy places / specially to flesshely delight or lecherye / both in spekyng or
in any other manner / For it is not convenient that a man in such places look
nor behold maid ne woman. but by thought and weye of maryage^ For as god
says in the Euangely / as tells and recounteth one Euangelyste / sayng that
the sweet Ihesu Christ entered or went in a church. which at that time was
called the Temple / where as men sold Mercery and other ware / And as our lord
god saw this / he put them out euerychone / And said that his hows should be
kept clean / And that it ought to be the hows of holy orysons and prayers.
and not hows of Marchaundyse nor pytte or spelonke for thieves / And for to
conferme these reasons our lord god has well showed to us appert or known
miracles / which of late he has made in the foresaid Chirches as ye have herd
/ And how that much displesyth him that men defowle his holy hows and his

Thensample of Eve our first mother capitulo / xxxix
tHe first ensample of evil and of sin / whereby the death is come and entered
in to this world came by Eve our first mother / that little kept the
commandment of god / and the worship wherein he had enhaunced and put her /
for he had made her lady / of all things living that were under the heaven /
which al were obeyeng to her / And if she had not fall in to the sin of
inobedyence / there had be no fysshe in the sea ne be on therthe / ne bird
in thayer / but that they had al be v^der her obeisaunce / and at her will
might have take them. and dyuyse and have them where someuer she would / Also
she should have had children without any dolor or pain / and never she should
have had honger ne thurst / another cold ne hete / trauaylle / ne sickness /
tristesse or heaviness of heart ne erthely death / No water might have drouned
her ne fire might have conbusced or burnt her / ne glauye or wepen might have
hurt her^ no thing might ennoye her /

Then look we and think how a sin alone without any more was cause to
putt her fro this great honor and worship and make her fall so low and in
such secuage / For she lost all that is before rehercyd only for the sin of
Inobedyence / Look ye well then / that ye keep you fro it / as I trust in god
ye shall remembrynge this Ensample. And know ye that the sin of our first
mother Eve / came by euylle and shrewed aqueyntaunce by cause she held parliament
with the serpente / which as the Hystorye sayth^ had a face right fair like
the face of a woman And spack right mekely / she herd him with all her will
/ and pryuely / where Inn she did like a fool / For if at the beginning she
had not herd him / But had come to her lord she had dyscomfyted and
overcome him to great shame / And so the fool herynge of him turned her in
to great loss and damage / And therefore my fair daughters / It is not good to
here folk / that been in their speech blandysshynge and casting many
flaterynge words / For they benefulle of decepcion / The Serpente found Eve
far froo her lord / and allone / Wherefore at his best leyser / he showed
her his deceyuable purpos and false langage / For the which cause it is not
good to be alone with any other / without he be of his next parente or kynrede
/ Not withstanding I say not but men may well bear honor to every one after
he is worthy / but men put more his honor and worship in Ieopardy and danger
by answer to much / than by few and short answer / For one word brings in
another

Of the second folly of Eve / Capitulo xlo.
tHe second folly of Eve our first mother is / that she to lyghtely answered
without remembryng her ne thynkyng to no harm / as lucifer demanded and
asked of her why she and her husbonde ete not of the fruit of the tree of life
as they did of other / she without taking any counceylle of her husbond
answered and held with him talkyng whereof she did like a fool and myshapped
her / For the answer was not conuenyent to her / but it longed and apperteyned
to her lord Adam by cause god had given to her lord the keeping of her and of
the fruit / And to him had devised and told / which fruytes they should
ete / And therefore she might have answered / that he should speak to her lord /
and not to her / And therefore my fair daughters herin may ye take good
Ensample / that if one require you of folly / or of any thing that touches
your honor and worship^ ye may well cover and hyde it / saying that ye thereof
shall speak thereof to your lord / Wherefore my fair daughters I would that ye
well withheld within your heart thexsample of a good lady of Acquyllee / which
the prince of that Country praid of foul love / And when he had enough prayed
and spoken to her / she answered that she should thereof speak to her lord / And
when the prince saw this^ he left her in pees / and never sith spack to her
thereof / and said to many one that she was one of the most parfyte and best
lady that was in his la^d / and in this manner the good lady received great
preysyng and loving of many one. And so ought every good woman do / and not
answer after her own will

The thyrdde folly of Eve capitulo / xlj /
tHe third folly of Eve was. that she was not reme^bryng the defense of god /
which he made to her / and to her lord. For god told them. that if they ete
of that fruit they should deye of it. And therefore when she answered to thenemy
lucifer / she told him not plainly the truth / but said if we ete of it / it
might fortune so that by adventure we should dye / She ^y^e put condition in
her answer / as many folysshe women do when men speak to them of folly / but
our lord god spak to them with out any condition / and without adventure /
Her simple and folysshe answer gaf to the serpent lucifer gretter boldness to
sp^^^ to her more largely and to tempte her more plainly / She did as they that
herkene. and that lyghtely answer to them that require them of foul love / For
by their simple and wise answer and by the herkynge of the foul talking of
them / that pray them of so foul love / they give to them place and leave to
speak ferthermore / as it happed to eve our first mother / which herd thenemy
that tempted her / and said to her / ye may well take of the fruit and ete of
it / and so shall ye know both good and evil as well as he that such
deffence has made unto you / Ye know not why he has forbede that ye should
ete none of it / It is because that ye should ete of it / ye should be as fair
as bright shynyng and as mighty as he him self is / And so the fool and (...)
wend he had told truth / and byleued him by couetyse and by his fair
speaking / as done the folysshe wymmen tha^ ben of light believe / as they here
the fair semely words and blandysshynge words of the Ianglours / that give
them counceylle to play and take the worldly disportes against their worship
and honor / and by their flaterynge words and promysses / which they hold
not they deceive them / so that the pour and unwise wymmen believe them in so
much that they consent and grant to the foul delight. of which they be by
them so tempted / whe^^f afterward they hold them self deceived and ashamed /
For when they have done with them their foul delight and accomplysshed their
will / they leave hem as shamefully defamed.

Of the fourth folly of Eve capo. / xlijo. /
He fourth folly of Eve was the foolyssh beholdynge / when she looked and
beheld the tree and the fruit forbeden that god had to them defended / This
tree was to her eyes so fair and so delectable / that she only by the sight of
hit desired of the fruit to the end she should ete it / And so by her foolysshe
lokynge. she fell in a foul thought / Therefore by a foul beholdynge and
lokynge come oftymes many peryls / for as the sage says / The worst envy that
men has. is the eye / Many have be deceived thorugh falls beholdynge / For
there be many men that by their great art make a falls samblau^t / or behauyng
of a falls beholdynge / as many one that behold and look steadfastly showing by
their look to be debonaire and gracious / whereof many a woman is by such falls
beholding deceived / for they wene and thynk that they make such lokyng and
have such byhauyng only by the destresse of loue^ But they do it for no
thing else than for to deceive them / And therefore this is a good Ensample to a
warraunt and keep him self of falls beholdynge / Nevertheless oftyme many one is
by them deceived / for when thenemye fyndeth them in such fool lokynge and
delight. he pryketh and enflammeth them by such temptacion. wherein he holds
them fast bounden / in so much that he makes them to fall in the fylthe or
ordure of that they desire to do / wherefore they lose both body and soul /
then all this euylle come only by foul beholdynge. And therefore I would ye
wyste and knew thensample of king dauyd / that only by a foul look in
beholding the wife of Vrye his knight he fell in fornycacion of auoutrye. And
after in homycyde / in making him to be put to death / whereof god took great
vengeance on him / and upon his people / which occasion came only by foul
beholdynge / as it befelle by our first mother Eve / that by her foolysshe look
and plaisir she fell in the fait or deed / which all the world and the
humayne lygnage bought full dear / By this lokynge fait or deed came the death in
to the world / And therefore this is a good ensample for to keep him self fro
such folyssh and falls lokynge /

Of the fyfthe folly of Eve capo / xliij
tHe fyfthe folly of Eve was when she took and touched the fruit / It had be
better that she had had no hands / For ouermoche peryllous was the touching
of it / But after the lokynge that sh had had. And as the two vices and her
will were acordynge to geder she had no fere ne dread no thing / but touched
it / and took of it at her will / And therefore says the sage that men ought
to keep him self fro touching of any delight / whereby the soul and the body
might be hurt in any manner / For foolisshe touching chaufe and enflamme the
heart / And when Reason is blind / which ought to rewle and govern both
heart and body. men fall in sin and in foolysshe del^te And yet says the
sage / who that surely will keep him (...) clenly / he ought to lock his bands
twyes or thryes. or that ^e come to towche or taste any foul thing / It is to
say that or (...) enterprise or undertake any fait or deed / he ought first to
thynk^ two or three times / For touching and kyssyng meueth (...) blood and
flesh in so much that they forgete the fere and dread of god / and the
worship of the world / And so many euylle deeds bicomen by foolisshe
attouchementis / As in like wise bifelle to Eve that touchid to the fruit
forboden

Of the sixthe folly of Eve / capitulo xli.ijo.
tHe sixthe folly was that she ete of the fruit. this was the most perilous
point of the dolorous fait / For by the same fait or deed. we and all the
world were delyuerd to the perille of the death of hell / and made strangers
of the greet joy of paradys. how many an euylle deed and dolorous become in
the world only by that etyng / god knows it / he god which is almighty / how
should men know how and in which manner thou shall punysshe them that done
such foolisshe and foul faite^ / And that delyteth them in delicious metes /
and in strong and sweet wynes / whereof they norysshe their body and fylle their
belly by which delight they be chaufed and meued to the foul delight of lechery
and to many other sin / Why take they no head to the pour / hongrye / that
deye for cold and for hongre and thirst / of which god shall ask and
demand to them acompte the day of his great Judgment / And know ye that
sin is not only in taking to much of metes and wynes / but gretter sin is
of the delight that men take in the sauoure and etyng of them / wherefore the
sage says that the death lies under the delyces as the net under the fisshe
which is cause of his death / Like wise the savor and delight that men take in
delycious metes brings the soul to death / And right so as the delight of the
appell brought Eve to death / in such wise be brought to their end may one by
the delight that they take in delicious metes and good wynes /

The seuenthe folly of Eve / Capitulo xlv
tHe seuenthe folly was / that she byleued not what our lord god had told her
and to adam her lord / that is / that she should dye if she ete of the fruit /
But he told her not that she should soon deye of bodily death / but symply had
said to her / that she should dye as she did / First her soul and after of
bodily death as she long time had be in the labor and pain of the world. and
that she had suffered much sorrow and sustained many meschyefs peynes and
dolours / as god told and promised her / And after her death she descended and
fylle in a derke and obscure prison / wheroute none scapeth / that was the
lymbo of hell where she and her husbond with all their lygnage were in prison
unto the time that our lord Ihesu Crist was put on the Cross which space of
time was five thousand year and moo / And that same time god delyuerd them /
and also al tho that had served him and had be obeisshyng to his
commandments in the old and ancient law / And the cursed and euylle folk
full of sin h^ let in the prison of hell / he took with him the whete / and
the straw he let bre^ne / Allas why thynk we not / also they that be slepynge
in sin to amend us / and not ever strive with the folysshe hope that we have
of long life and not abide tylle we see us nyghe our term and end / Such
folk sees not the death that of nyghe follows them which suddenly shall come
/ as the thief that comes in at back door to rob and kytte men's throtes
/ And no man knows when he comes / And after this thief stelyng day by day
is destroyed / Like wise is of the sinners that sin day by day / till the
death takes them and destroys them Also as the thief that steleth / and that
can not him self absteyne fro euylle doing / and has a delight in his theeftes
tylle the time he is taken and put to death / Like wise of the sinner that so so
much goth and comes to his folysshe playsaunce and to his delytes that men
ben perceyuyng of it / in so much that he is ashamed and dyffamed of the world
/ and hated of god and of the sages /

Of the eyghte folly of Eve / capitulo xlvjo.
tHe eight folly of Eve. was / that she gaf thappel to her husbond / and praid
him to ete of it / as she did / And as a fool would not disobeye her / And
therefore they were both partyners of our great sorrow and euylle / Here
then is a good ensample / For if any woman counceylle any thing to her
husbond / he ought first to think if she said well or not / and to what end
her counceylle shall mow come / or that he to her cou^seylle give any consent
/ For none ought to be enclyned toward his wife ne so obeysshynge / but that he
first consydere if she says wel^ or not / Many wymmen be / that give no force
and care of nothing / but that they may have their will / I my self knew a
Baron / that byleued in all things his wife. in so much / that by her
foolysshe counceylle / he took death / whereof it was great pity and damage /
But better it had be to him that he had dredde her less and less byleued /
Like as Adam folysshly bileuyd his wife to his and our also great meschyef and
sorrow / Therefore every good woman ought to think well / what counceylle she
will give to her lord / and that she counceyl him not to do any thyng^ whereby
he or she may have any shame or damage in acomplysshynge her foolyssh will /
For and she be wise she ought to think to what end other good or euylle / her
counceylle may come / And like as eve would not do well / nevertheless she ought
not to counceylle other to do euylle / For it suffysed well / and to much if
she did it / Herupon may we take good Ensample / for if one will not fast ne
do any good / he ought not to give to any other shrewde counceylle that may
keep him fro good and holy doynge^ And therefore says the sage / he that so
cou^ceyleth other has the gretter part of the sin / And therefore if one
will do no good / let other do as they be wyllyng to doo^

The nynthe folly of Eve Capitulo xlvij
tHe nynthe folly of Eve was the last and most / For as god did putt her to
reason / askyng to her / why she had trespaced his commandment / and had made
her lord to fall in sin / she then would have excused her / and said that
the serpent had so counceyled her / and had made her to do it / S^^ wend to
alyght her euylle and her sin / puttyng the charge of the deed upon other /
Wherefore it seemed that god therefore was more angry then than he was before /
For he said that fro thens forthon should the bataylle be of it between her and
the enemy / by cause she would be like unto god / also that she did trespass
his commandment / And because she byleued more in the enemy than she did in
him / that had made her / Also by cause she deceived her lord by her folyssh
counceylle / and that she w^lde have excused her sin and mysdede / god put
the bataylle between man and thenemy / For thexcusacions of eve displeasid
much to god / as done now these days they that confess them and publysshynge
their mysfaytes and sins. excuse them self in their confession / that is to
wit that they ne confess or tell their sins so vylaynsly as they made them
and therefore they be semblable and like unto our first mother Eve / which
excused her / But saint Powle says that who so will be well and clenly
washed of sin / he ought to confess and tell it as shamefully as he has
done / or else he is not clean of sin. For as saint Peter says / Like so as
the thief dwells fayn there as he may be hyd and there as men hyde and couere
his theft / and goth not there as men cry after him / Right so and by
semblable manner does sin in such folke^ For they be lodged with thenemy
which hydeth their theftes / that is to say their sins by subtyle
temptacion / Here shall I leave to speak of Eve our first mother. and shall
tell you how none wise woman ne ought to be to hasty in taking any new
things brought up / ne other noueltees /

And how sith late a holy man did preche thereof / And after this matere I
shall tell and reherce unto you the ensample of a knight that had three wives
/ and all upon this matere / And then I shall turn again to the tale and
matere of the euylle and shrewde wives / And also I shall tell of the good
and holy wymmen / And how the holy scripture preyseth them

How a holy bishop reprysed and taught many ladies Capitulo xlviij /
I Shall tell you how a holy man late did preche / and was a bishop a
right good clerk / At his prechynge and sermon were many ladies and
damoisellys / of which some were dressid and clothed after the new manner / the
remenaunt of their heedes was like two horns / and their gowns made after the
new gyse. whereof the good holy man had merueyle. and began to repreue them
gyuynge and rehercynge to fore them many a fair ensample / and told them how
the deluge or gaderyng of waters in the days of Noe was because of the pride
and desguysynge of men and specially of wymmen / that counterfeted them self of
new and dishonest rayments / And then when thenemye saw their great pride
and their desguysynge / he made them to fall in the fylthe of the stynkyng
sin of lecherye / which thing was so much displesynge to god. that he did
made to rain forty days and forty nyghtes / without cessynge / in so much
that the waters were above the earth / and surmounted by heyght of ten Cubits
upon the hyhest montayn / Then was all the world drowned and perysshed / and
none abode on live / sauf only. Noe. his wife / his three sones^ and his three
daughters / And all this great meschyef came because of that sin / And then
as the bishop had showed to them this fayte and many other / he said that the
wymmen that were so horned were like the snayle that been horned. He said more /
I doubt said he that betwyxt their horns thenemye has made his mancion and
dwelling / For as they take holy water / they cast dounward their faces / And
that makes the deuylle sitting upon their heed by nature and strength of
the holy water / He told and reherced to them many merueyles in so much.
that at the end of his predicacion he made hem to be mowrnynge and full of
thought / For he had repreued them so sore / that they had so great shame /
that they ne durst lift up their hedes / and held them mocked / and diffamed
of their vice / And after many of them cast awey their branches and horns /
and held them low and went symply / For he said that such coyntyses and
such countrefaytyng and such wantonness were to compare to the Copspyn that
makes his net / to take the flies / Right so does the deuylle by his
temptacion the desguysyng in men and wymmen / to the end they may be enamoured
one of other. and for to take and bring them to the delight of lechery / He
takes them / and byndeth them / as the copspyn does the flees in her net as
a holy heremyte tells in the book of the faders of life / to whom was showed
by tongue as ye may find plainly in the said book. And yet he says that the
coulpe of the sin was in them / that first took and brought up such
desguysynge and that every good womman and wise ought well to dread the taking
and werynge of such raymentes unto the time she sees that every one comynly
took and went in hem / For after the word of god / the first shall be the most
blamed / And the last shall sit on the hyhe syege / The bishop that a good man
was said an Ensample upon the fait of them that hasted them to be the first in
taking and bringing up such noueltees / And said thus.

How the young ladies were scorned and mocked of the old and Ancient /
Capitulo xlix
IT befelle that many ladies and damoysels were come at the weddyng of a maid
/ As they were going toward the place / where as the dinner should be / they
found a passing foul wey within a medowe / Then said the young lady / We
shall well go thorugh this medowe and leave the hyhe way The Ancient and wise
said they should go the hyhe way / For it was the best and more sure going and
most dry / The young ladies that full were of their will / would not follow
them / and thought they should be before them / at the said place / And so they
took their weye thorugh the medowe / where were old cloddes all roten / And as
they were upon them / they brake under their feet / And so they fell in the
myere and dyrte unto the knees / And with great pain came they out again /
and took the high weye / They made clean their hosen and gowns with their
knyues the best they couthe / So long they were in wasshyng of their hoses and
gowns / that they might not come to the begynnnyng of the dinner / Every one
demanded and asked after them but no body couth tell of them / At the last
they came as the first mes or course was eten / and after they had taken their
refectio^ and well dro^ken they began to tell and recounte how they were
fall in the mire unto the knees to / Ye said then a good ancient / and wise
lady that was come by the hyhe weye / Ye wend to take the shortest way to
the end / ye might be the ^ sonner and first at the place and would not follow us
/ hit is well bestowed / For I tell you for certain that some wene to auai^^e
them self / that hyndreth them / And such one is that weneth to be the first
and formest that often fyndeth her the last of all / She gaf them these two
notables / to the end they should know their fault / for as says the said holy
man thus is hit of this world / they that first may have noueltees of the
world^ wene to do well and be therefore enhaunced and to fore other ben holden
and wysshed / but as for one that holds hit well done / there ben ten that
maken of hit / For such one preyseth their doing before them / that behind
their back puts out his tongue scornynge and mockyng them

Yet of the same capitulo / l
sHe holds her self the best welcome that first brings upon her any
noueltees / But as the good and holy man says / they that first take such
new raymentis be like to the young ladies that fylle in the myere / whereof they
were mocked by the wise ladies that took the best and right wey / for men may
not mock them that keep such wey / And that use their life after reason and
not after their own will / I say not / but that when that manner of new
raymentis is taken and comynly wered of every one / and in every town / it may
be then worn and taken / but yet the wise woman shall leave and forbere it if
she can And such wymmen shall not be like ne compared to them that fylle in
the myere by cause they would be first in the place / and they were the last /
Therefore my fair daughters hit is good that none have her not / but good is to
hold the myddel estate / The less is the most certain and seurest / but as
now is a cursed and shrewed world / For if sum folysshe woman full of her
will takes and brings upon her any noueltee and new estate / every other
one shall soon say to her lord / Sire it is told to me that such one has
such a thing that over fair is / and that so well becomes her / I pray you
good sire that I may have such one / for I am as good and as gentle of blood
/ And ye as Gentyl a man as she and her lord ben / and have as well for to pay
as she has / And thus she shall find so many reasons. that she shall have
her will / or else ryote and noise shall all day be at home / and never shall
be there pees / tylle she have her parte^ be it right or wrong / She shall not
look if any of her neighbors have that thing that she will have / Also she
shall not abide till every one have it / but the hastlyest that she may she
shall do shape and make it / And forthwith shall were it / It is merueyle of
such coyntyse and noueltees / whereof the great clerks say that seeing the men
and wymmen so desguysed and taking every day new raiments / they doubt that
the world shall perysshe / as it did in time of Noe / that the wymmen
desguysed them and also the men which displesid god / And herupon I shall
reherce you merueil which a good lady did recounte to me in this same year /
She told and said to me that she with many other ladies were come to a feeste
of saint Margrete / where as every year was great assemble made / There came a
lady much coynt and Ioly / and dyuersly disguysed and arraid more than any
other there / And by cause of her strange and new array euerychone of them
came to behold and look on her / as it had be a wild be / For her clothyng
and array was different and no thing like to their / And therefore she had well
her part beholding and lokyng Then said the good lady esto her / My friend
tell ye us if it please you how ye name that array that ye have on your heed
She answerde and said the galhows array / God bless us said the good lady. the
name of hit is not fair / And I ne wot how such array may plese you / The
tydyng of this array and of his name were borne al about high and lowe^ whereof
every one s^orned and mocked her^ And as mockyng and scornynge came there she
was to behold and look upon her / I did ask of the good lady^ the manner and
facion of the same array / And she told me the manner of it / but euylle I
witheld it But as far as I me remember of it / Hit was high culewed with
long pynnes of silver upon her head after the making and manner of a gybet or
galhows right strange and merueylous to se / And in good feyth after that time
the young and folysshe lady that had that array on her heed was ever mocked
and scorned and naught set by / Here shall I leave to speak of the new and
desguysed raymentis and of the good bishop that so repreued them that had
and wered such array And that deed show to them by Ensamples and holy scripture how that such noueltees / that specially wymmen took on them was
token and sign of sum great meschyef to come as is werre / famyne and
pestylence.

Of the good knight that had three wives and of their lives Capitulo lj
Air daughters I would ye couthe and well withheld the example of a knight that
had three wives / A knight was sometime a right good man / and of good and honest
living / which had an Heremyte to his uncle a good and holy man and of
relygyous life / This knight and his first wife which he much loved were but a
little space of time to geder / For the death that all consumes and destroys /
took her / whereof the knight was so full of sorrow that nyghe he deyde thereof /
He ne wyste where to seek any comfort sauf only to the Heremyte his uncle that
he knew for a holy man / He came to him mournyng and weeping / waylynge and
regretyng his wife / The holy men comforted him in the best manner and wise that
he couthe / And at the last the knight preid him that he would pray god for him
that he might know whether she was dampened or saved / The holy man had pity
of his neuewe / and went in to his (...) And there he made his prayer to god /
and required that it (...) please him to show where she was / And after he had
be long time in oryson / he fylle a sleep / And soon after him thought / he
saw the pour soul before saint Mychael tharchaungel / and the fend at the
other side / and was in a balaunce / and her good deeds with her / And at the
other side was the devil with all her evil deeds / which grieved and troubled
her sore / it were her gounes that were of much fyn cloth / and furred of
calabre / letuce and ermyn And the envy or deuylle cried with a high voys and
said / Sire this woman had ten pair of gowns long and short / And ye know well
she had with half of them enough / that is a long gown / two kyrtells and two
cottes hardyes / or two short gowns / and therewith she might have be pleasid
and suffised. as a good and simple lady / and after god and right she has had
of them to much by the half and of the valewe of one of her gowns / l / pour
people had had l. else of burell or fryse / which have suffered such cold and
such mesease about hem / and yet she never took pity on them / Then took the
devil her gowns / rings and Iewelles yt she had had of the men by love / Also
all the vain and euylle words that she / had said of other by envy / and
taken awey their good renommee / For ouermoche she was enuyous and of evil
talkyng / and no sin that she had done he left behind / but all this to
geder he did put in the balaunce / and weyed / they were to her good deeds /
but much more they weyed than did all the good that she ever had done / And
thus took her the deuylle which did her to endowe her gowns that were then
brennyng as fire and had her within in to hell. And the power soul cried and
sorowed pyteously / Then awaked the holy heremyte / and told part of this
aduysion to the knight his neuewe / And commanded him and charged that all her
gowns should be given for gods sake to pour folk /

Of the second wife / capitulo / lij
aFter this the said knight married him again to another woman / they were five
year to geder / And then she passed out of this world / And if the knight
had be sore meuyd and sorrowful of the death of his first wife / yet more he was
of his second wyf^ And weeping came to theremyte his uncle demenynge great
sorrow / and praide him for this as he had done for the other that he might
know where she was / And for the great pity that he took of him / seeing him
in such sorrow went allone in his Chapel / And there made to god his prayer
and oryson / There it was showed and reveled to him that she should be saved /
but yt she should be.C. year within the fire of purgatory / For certain fawtes
which she had done she being in her marriage. that was that a squire had leyn
with her and other great sins / Nevertheless she had thereof many time be
confessid / for if she had not so do she without doubt had be dampened /

Then came theremyte to the knight / and told him how his wife was saved /
whereof he was ioyeful and glad / Here may ye see how that for one dedely sin
she was so long in the fire of purgatory / but it may well be / as the holy man says that they had done the deed ten or twelve times /

For a certain and very truth is / for every dedely sin confessid shall
the soul be punysshed in purgatory the time and space of seven year / Fair
daughters take ye here good ensample how this fowll and falls delight is dear
bought / And how thereof men must give acompte / And also of them that have so
many gowns and that so much waste their good to be Iolyf and repair their
carayn / in so much they may have the look and beholdynge of the world / and
the plaisaunce of the folk / Now see how it happed to the knyghtis first wife /
that for her pride and for the great quantite of gowns and Iewelles that she
had / was lost and dampened for ever / And yet many one is in this world that
well have the courage so proud / that well they dare bye gowns of three or
four score Crowns / and yet thynkyng hit of little prys / that if so were they
must give to pour folk two or three shyllynges / they should hold that
ouermoche / and as half lost / Look and behold ye then how they that have
so many gowns whereof they coyntyse and array their bodies / how ones they
shall straightly answer of them / And therefore every good woman after she is of
estate and degree she ought to hold and behave her symply and honestly in her
clothyng / and in the quantite of hit / And give a part to god / to the end she
may in the other world be clothed of all joy and glory / as did the holy
ladies and holy virgins as in their legende is rehercyd / As of saint
Elyzabeth / of saint Katheryn and of saint Agathe and other mo / that gave
their gowns to the pour folk for the love of god And so ought to do every
good woman / Now I have told^ and recounted to you of the two first wives of
the knight / and herafter ye shall here of the third

Of the third wife of the knight capitulo / liij
sone after took the said knight his thyrdde wife / and were long time to geder
/ but at the last she deyde / wherefore the knight was nyghe deed for sorrow /
And when she was deed / the knight came to his Eme / and praid him for the same
as he had done for his two first wives / And as the holy man was in his
prayers and oryson / it came to him in aduysyon that an angel was before him /
which showed him the torment and pain that the pour soul suffered /

For he saw appertely and clearly / how one deuylle held her fast with his
hondes or clowes. by her here is and tressis / as a lion holds his proye / in
such manner / that she couthe naught meue her head here ne there / and did
put brennyng nedels thorugh her brows / which entered in to her heed / as
far as he might thruste them in / And the pour soul at every time cried
horrybly / And after he had made her to suffer such great martyr that
ouerlonge lasted / Another deuylle horrible and over hydous came there with
great brondes of fire / and thrested them unto her face / And in such manner he
tormented her and burnt. and enflammed her over all sides / that the Heremyte
was thereof sore effrayed and trembled for fere / But the Aungel assured him and
said that she had well deseruyd it / And theremyte demanded of him why / And
the Angel said that she had popped and polysshed her face for to seem more
fair and plaisaunt to the world And that it was one of the sins that was
most displesynge to god / For she did hit by pride / by which men fall to
the sin of lecherye / And finally in to all other. For above all thing it
displesith to the Creator. as one will have by craft more beauty than nature
has given to him / And that hit suffyseth him not to be made and compassid
after the holy image / Of whom all the Angels in heaven take all their joy
and delight / For if god had would of his holy purueau^ce / they had not be
wymmen / but they had be domme beestes or serpents / And why then take they
no heed to the great beauty which their creatoure has given him / And why
do they put to their faces other thing than god has given hem It is therefore
no merueyle if they endure and suffer such penaunce^ And then said the
Aungel she has well deserved it / Go ye there as the body of her lies and ye
shall see the vysage right hydous and affrayed / And by cause he was eueer besy
about her brows and about her temples and forheede to dress and paynte them
that she might be fair / and playsaunt to the world / it is convenient and
right that in every place wheroute she plukked any here of her face / that
there be put every day a brennynge bronde / Sire said the Heremyte shall she
be long in this torment / Ye said the angel a thousand year / and more he
would not discouere ne tell to him of hit / But as the deuylle did put the
brounde in her face / the power soul cried sore / and cursed the hour / that
she ever was borne or engendryd / And of the fere that then the holy
heremyte had he awoke all afraid / And came to the Knight. And told him his
vysyon /

The knight was sore abashed and right sore meued of this auysyon / And went
to see the body that men would have supposed had be fair / but they found the
vysage so black and so hydous and so horrible to see that it was great
confusion / Then bileued well the knight for certain all that theremyte his
uncle had told him / whereof he had great horroure and great abhomynacion and
pity / in so much that he left the world and did were the hair every friday
and every wednesday / and gaf for gods sasake the third part of all his
reame and good / And fro thennes forth he used and holy life / and had no cure
more of the worldly bobaunces / ne plaisire so much he was ferful and agaste
of that he had seen his last wife / and of that uncle had told him

Of the lady that blanked and popped her Capitulo l^^ij ^
aNd for to afferme this Ensample that it may for very certain have be^ I
shall tell you of such one that by fell but to late / I saw a baronnesse
right a high and noble lady of lygnage / the which as men said blanked and
popped or peynted her self / I saw also him that gaf to her every year such
things wherewith she popped her / wherefore he took yearly great pension of her
/ as he him self said as he was a part at his seurte / This lady was sometime
right much honored and worshipped and also right mighty / her lord deyde /
wherefore ever syn her stat day by day dymynnyssed / One time was that she had
more than.lx / pair of gowns as men said / but at the last she had less and
scant enough / And of her I herd say / that after she was deed her visage and
all the body of her took such form and cou^trefaiture that men ne couthe say
what it was But well I wene that the peyntynge of her face whereof often she used
as she lived / also the great pride of her and the great wast and superfluyte
of her gowns was cause and occasion of such horrible countrefeture / wherefore
my fair daughters I pray you that here ye will take good Ensample and well
withold it and keep hit in rememembraunce withynne your hertes / And that ye
put no thing to your faces / but love them / as god and nature has made and
ordained them. for ye may find and see at our lady of Rukemadoure many
tresses of ladies and damoyselles that had washed them in wyn and other
things / And therefore they might not enter in to the Chirche^ till they had do
kyt of their tresses and brought them in to the Chapel of our lady / where
as yet they be hangynnge / This fayt or deed is approved / And I tell you that
that our lady did show to them great love in doing this myracle^ for the
glorious vyrgyn would not that they should lose their pain and time coming
thither / Also that they should not be lost for ever / therefore she showed the
said miracle on them / wherefore they that were in the weye of perdicion were
brought to the weye of salvation / Here is a fair spectacle to every woman to
see in / and conceive the time coming and the time also gone and passed as in
the time of Noe when thorugh the sin of pride god sent the deluge of waters /
whereof all the world was drowned / for by that sin of pride came among men
and wymmen the foul and vile sin of lecherye / And thereof came the great
peril / and of all the world escaped no more but eight persons

Of the wife of loath that trespassed the commandment of god / Capitulo.lv.
aN Ensample I shall reherce unto you / of Lothis wife / which god saved out of
Gomore with her lord and her two daughters / God defended her that she ne should
look bebynde her / but she did not his commandment / but looked anon behind
her / And therefore she bycam / and was turned in to a salt stone / Right so as
saint Martyn of verter deed do fall and perysshe the Cytee of derbenges
which was in the bisshopryche of Nantes / which perisshed thorugh the sin
of lechery and of pride as did that Cite / wherout Loath was saved / that was
Gomore and Sodom and other five Cytees moo that god made to be conbusted and
sonken unto the Abysmes / And bicame a great water that men call the lake of
Gomore / And the cause was the sin of lecherye / that so merueylously
stynketh / that the stenche of it goth unto the heaven / and bestormeth all the
order of nature / And so were the seven Cytees bre^ned and fourdryed in
stynkyng sulphur / by cause they that were much used of the fylthe and ordure
of lechery / For he that might do it / did it without having any shame / And to
it enforced them self without keeping in their foul and abhomynable doing the
law of reason of nature^ And right so as their hertes were burnt and
esprysed in that foul sin of lechery / our lord god made them to be brent
and with them their children and goods by thonder and stynkyng fire of
sulphur / which over hot and horrible is. And this was the vengeance and
punycion of our creatoure the fader / Here is a fair ensample. how men ought
well to keep hem self fro the forfait of marriage which is commandment of god
/ For in marriage men may do many grievous sin / After then as the wife of
Loath had looked behynd her for to see the torment of the sinners that were
perysshynge by fire of sulphur as before is said / she was transformed in to a
stone by cause she trespassed the commandment of god / Here may the synnar
take fair ^^^nyffyaunce or ensample in thynkyng how often god has pardo^^ned
him his misdeeds and faults when he has granted him grace to confess them /
but the commandment of god. that is to say of the priest which has defended
him. that no more h^ should see behind / that is to understand that he ne should
torn any more to sin / but eftsoone after he does the contraire / And such
men or wymmen be to compare to the wife of Lothe^ And as I trow they shall at
the last be transformed in to a stone as she was / that is to wete transported
or borne in to the Abismes of hell / I would ye couthe thexample of the lady
that did leave her lord that was a fair knight / and went with a Monk / and
her brethren pursewed her / and did so much that they found her that night
lyenge with the said monk / They kyt awey the Genytoryes of the monk / and
casted them in their susters vysage / And they took them and both to geder
they putted in a sakke with great foyson or quantite of stones and casted them
in to a deep water / And so both to geder they were drowned / For of evil life
comes ever an euylle end / And it is a sin that needs must at the last be
known and punysshed / And yet I shall tell thexample of the two daughters of
Loath / how thenemy tempted them vylaynsly / They saw ones their fader without
any breche / And forthwith both were tempted of his company / and they
discovered each to other their secre^e and faitt / And then went and took
good wynes and good metes and festyed and chyered their fader^ and so much
they made him drynk that he was drunk / And anon they had him to his bed /
and both all naked went / and leyd them self a both his sides / And meuyd
him to fornycacion / in so much he had the maydenhode of them both / which
were his daughters / This was a perilous and abhomynable sin / Nevertheless
they were both great with child / And had two sons the one named Moab / and
the other was called Amon / Of which two sons came first the paynyms / and the false law / And many euyls and sorrow came by that sin And men say they were
bycome passing proud after the transformacion of their mother / And that all
their intent was to coyntyse and arraye them self / which caused the devil
first to temp^e them lyghtlyer and the sooner he brought them to that foul
sin of lechery / I would also ye couthe and well had withold within your
thoughts thexample of the foul damoysel / the which for a hood that a knight
gaf her / she did so much by certain yeftes and promesses that her lady did
his will / and made her to be diffamed and dishonored / whereof great meschyef
befelle / For a servant of her lord which of yongth he had brought up and
norysshed perceived him of it / and told it to his lord / in so much that
soon after he took and fond the knyt with his wife / he kylde him / and did
his wife to be mewred and put in prison perpetuel / where as she deyde in
great sorrow and ^angoure / It happed ones or she was deed / that her lord came
forth by the prison where she was in / he then stood still and harked what
she said / And she sorowed sore and cursid her that had counceyled her so to
do / And then he sent one to wete what was she that so had counceyled her /
And she said how it was her damoisell The lord made her come to fore him and
commanded and straytly charged her / that she should say truth / And at the
last she confessed that she was cause of her meschyef / And that she had
counceyled her / and for her labor she had of the knight a hoode / And then
the lord said / For a little thing ye have undo you and have be to me
traitresse. And therefore I Judge and give sentence / that the hood and the neck
be both cut to geder / And so was her Judgment / Now may ye see how good
is to take with him good company and in his seruyse good and true servants
that be not blamed of no man living / For the said damoysell was not wise /
And therefore good is to take wise servants and not fools / For fools and
shrewd servants be sooner brought to do sum euylle and to give euylle
counceylle to their lord or lady than other / as did the two daughters of
loathe one to other / And the same damoysel which had and received the gwerdon
of her deserte

Of the daughter of Jacob that was depuceled or her maiden hode taken fro her /
Capitulo lvj
I Shall tell you another Example of the daughter of Jacob / which for
lyghtnes and Iolyte of heart left the house of her fader and of her brethren
for to goo and see the atoure or array of the wymmen of another land / Wherefore
hit happed that Sychem the sone of amor which was a great lord in that land
saw her so fair that he coueyted her / and prayed her of love / in so much he
took fro her maydenhode / and then when her twelve brethren wyste and knew
of hit / come thither and slew him and also the most part of his lygnage and
of his folk for the shame that they had of their suster / that so had be
depuceld or defowled / Now look ye and see how by a foolysshe woman comes many
euyllis and domages / For by her yongthe and by her light courage was made
great occyflon and shedyng of blood / As it fortuned and happed by a daughter
of a king of greece which by her foolyssh love acoynted her of the sone of an
earl of that Country. wherefore the king made him werre during the which more
than a thousand men were slain / And yet had the werre longer lasted when
the kings brother which was a wise man come to the king / and said to him /
Sire quod he I merueyle much that only for the sport and delight of your
daughter / so many good knights ben lost and also so many good men / It were
better that never she had be borne / The king then said / ye sa^e truth
/ And anon he made his daughter to be take / by which the meschyef was
bygonne / and made her to be hewn in small pyeces / And then before all he
said / that well right it was / that she should be so detrenchid by whom so
many had been hewn and slain

Of thamar that had company with her husbondes fadre Capitulo lvij
I Will that ye here thexample of Thamar which was wife to Henam that was sone
of Judah sone of Jacob and brother to Joseph / This Henam was yrous and felon /
and of evil life of which I will not say much nor al / by cause god would that
he deyd suddenly and pytously. And as Thamar saw / that of her lord she myht
have no lygnage she bethought her that the fader of her lord should yet engendre
and get children well / and that she was not barayn / And coueyted and desired
to have his flesshely company / which was against the law / Nevertheless so
much she did / that she came by night in his Chamber and leid her with him And
as I wene she conceived of him two Children / of which the one was named
phares. And the other had to name Zaram. wherefore many tribulacions and euylls
befelle afterward For the children that been not of true marriage / they be they
by whom the great herytages and Auncestri ben lost / whereof I shall tell
you an Ensample of a king of Naples / as it is contained in the Chronicles of
that land / There was sometime a queen of that lo^d which clenly ne truly kept
her body toward her lord / in so much she gate a sone by another than her lord
/ It befelle afterward / that this sone was made king of the land / after the
death of the king / This new king was passing proud and loved not his
lordis ne barons but was to them full hard and felon and also to al his comyns
he was unreasonable / For he took fro them all that he couthe / And enforced
their wives / and vyoled their daughters / And used all evil deeds / which he
couthe ymagyne to do / He bigan werre to his neighbors and to his Barons in
so much that all the reame was put in exyle and brought to great pouerte.
which long time lasted / In that time was there a Baron a good man and a right
good knight / which went unto an Heremytage / where as was an holy heremyte
much relygious / And that many things knewe^ The knight demanded and asked
of him how and wherefore they had so long war in the land And if it should yet
last long time / And the holy Here myte answered him. Sire it is co^uenyent
that the time have his course / that is to say that as long as this king and
one his sone shall be on live the tribulacion shall not cesse / And I shall
tell you why / truth it is that this king that now regneth is not true heyr
to the Crown / but is borne in aduoultrye / And therefore he may not be
peasyble to the reame ne have the Ioysau^ce of it / wherefore he and his reame
must have sorrow and tribulacion / as long as a falls heyr / shall possess it /
But his sone shall have none heyr / And so shall fynysshe the false lygnee and
shall the reame come again to the right heir / And then shall less the
pestylence and pees shall be / And al haboundaunce of goods shall come to
the reame / Right so as the good Heremyte had said. so it befelle. He said
more over / For he spak of the false queen / and said she should be punysshed in
this world and that the wife of the king her sone should accuse her toward her
lord / And hou she should lie with one of her priests / and that the king her
sone should find hem to geder / and how both / he should do to be brent in a
great fornais / And all this befelle afterward as he said / For in certain
the queen was destroyed and burnt by the commandment of the king her sone /
And therefore my good daughters a noble thing is to keep him self clenly in his
marriage / And for a falls heir often comes in a land many euyls and
tribulacions / For by the false heirs ben lost the great lordshipes / and the
moders of them dampened perpetuelly in hell as long as their sons shall
possess any ground of their parastre / that is to say of their moders husbond

Of Joseph that would not have the company of the queen Capitulo lviij
Fair daughters I shall tell you an Ensample of a great euylle that came by
lokynge and folysshe plaisaunce. It is of Joseph the sone of Jacob / he that
was sold by his brethren to the king Pharaon / This Joseph was of merueylous
beauty wise and right humble / And for his good seruyse the king loved him
much and gafe him baundon over all the goods that were in his reame. The
queen that saw him so fair gentle meke and curteys was soon merueylously
enamoured of him. And showed him many signs and tokenes of love in beholdynge
and lokynge on him / And when the queen saw that for any thing that she couthe
do / he would not consent to her evil will / she was sore troubled and nyghe
out of her wit At the last she called him and had him alone with her in a
chamber / and there she preid him of love / But he that was good and honest
answered to her / that he never should be such a traitoure to his lord / And
then she with her fyst took him fast by the mantell and bigan to cry as
loud and high as she might. in so much all came thither / She said to the
lord that he would have have forced her / And forthwith the lord made him to be
take / and put in a prison / which was right derke and obscure / where he was
a long space of time / But afterward god that would not forgete him for his
virtue and goodness delyuerd him out of prison / And was gretter master than
he was before in the reame and more better loved and honored / And therefore is
here a good ensample / For god enhaunceth ever the Just and true / And the false queen was punysshed. for within a little time after she deide vylaynsly /
and suddenly of an euylle death / and so god rewarded each of them after their
deserte and merit / Therefore is here a fair ensample to do well / For of good
delyng and of good guydynge came never but worship and honor / And as says
theua^gelyst / there is no good deed done but it shall be remembryd and
rewarded / Ne also none euylle deed done but that it shall be punysshed /
Therefore getynge of falls heirs is great sorrow and tribulacion to come in a
land where as they become lords of / wherefore the moders of them shall be
delyuerd to the dolorous death of hell / wheroute they shall never issue / as
long as their children bastardys shall hold any of the land and goods of their
husbondes / And all this is very troth as witnesses many that been suscited
again / and so does the holy scripture also

Of the daughters of Moab / of whom the evil lygnee issued Capitulo lix /
aNother ensample I shall tell you of the euylle wymmen that were in time
passed / how the daughters of Moab were falsely engendryd and gotten / And
against the lawe^ And comynly of an euylle or bad tree yssueth bad and euylle
fruit / For these daughters were fools and full of lechery / wherefore it
bifelle that balam which was a paynym for to do gryef to the host of the
sons of Israel / did do make these daughters queynt and Ioly and well arrayed
of rich clothes and with precious stones / And sent them in the said host of
the Hebreux which were al folk of god to the end he should make them to fall
in sin with them / And that their god should cast therefore his ire upon them
/ Then came these coynted and Ioly daughters in to the host of the Jews / of
whom many of them as they saw the beauty of them / were sore tempted / and so
esprysed of their love / that at the last they took and had their delight and
plaisau^ce with them / wherefore the princes of the host made no semblaunt /
but god was therefore angry upon them / And commanded to Moses that the
princes of the host that such inyquyte had sustained and made should be
hanged. and put to death / Wherefore Moses made anon to know thorugh out all
the host the commandment of god / which sone after was accomplysshed / and
many one put to death for the forsaid foul deed and inyquyte /

Here is a good ensample for the princes and Capytayns of hoostes that suffren
many force and vyolence to be done / and that suffren a great nombre of
harlottes within their host / well may they see how such things displeasen
god the fader / that would take vengeance of the capitaynes of the Jews host
/

Of the Jew and of the paynym / that were broched with aswerd Capitulo lx /
I Shall tell you another Ensample that befelle another time in the said
host of the sons of Israel / that is to wit. the Jews that were people of
god / and that kept his laws / Now it befelle that the daughter of Madyan
which was a paynym was so sore tempted that she coynted and arrayed her in the
best wise she couthe / And then came in to the host of Ebreus / She was coynt
and Ioly and right richely and nobly arayd / And did come thither only for horse
and harnois that is to wete / to accomplisshe her foul delight. She came so
far in to the host that a knight one of the lords of the host espied her
and saw her / the which was lyghtely tempted and surprysed of her love / in
so much he did made her to come in to his ten^e and lodging and took his
delight with her / And hit ha^ped then as it plesyd god that one of the most
Chyuetayns and lord of the host knew and perceived this foul deed. And be in
contynent came there / as they were yet nyghe to geder / and broched and put his
sword thorugh both the bodies of them / And so loathe they deyde there
vylaynsly by the sin of lechery / The knight was named Sambry / and was of
the lygnage of Symeon that was of the twelve princes of their law / And yet
nevertheless he was not spared. For the princes and chyuetayns of the host that
saw how god wrought for them that every day were fyghtyng against as many mo
as they were / And that all the vyctoryes yt they had / they had them through
the myt of god which would spare no man / but did good Justice to every man
what someuer he had be / For it was another right neither reason / that their
folk should lie with them of other law / as the Christian folk with the Jews
and sarasyns / And so they held and kept them self clenly as much for fere
of their princes / as for the love of god. And god gave hem vyctory and
warauntyssed them / And for certain the thing that god keeps / shall never
be hurted ne domaged in no wise / Now may ye see how god hates the sin and
deed of lechery / And how he will that men be punysshed of it

How none ought to abide allone in a place with another alone Capitulo lxj
yEt my dear daughters I shall tell you another ensample / how men ought not
to abide alone with another al one / all be he of his parente / his affynyte or
other For ye shall here how it befelle to thamar the daughter of king Dauyd to
whom her brother took awey her maydenhede / This Amon was tempted against god
and ageynste the law / And for to accomplysshe his euylle will / feigned him
self to be seek. and made his suster to serve and keep him. He ever looked on
her of a waunton and falls regard / and kyssed and embraced her / And so much
he made little and little that he chaffed him so that he depuceled her / that
is to say / he took her maydenhede fro her / And when Absolon her brother of
fader and mother wist and knew it al most he wexe wood for ire and anger / He
slew his brother Amon that such desloyalte and untruth had done to his suster
And thereof came many tribulacions and euyls /

And therefore here is a fair Ensample / For every woman that clenly will keep
honor and worship ought not to abide alone with a man alone without it be
with her lord / with her fader or with her sone / and not with any other / For
many euyls and temptacions ben thereof come / Of the which if I would I should
reherce you of many of them / to whom as men say is evil happed and also by
their nygh parents / Therefore it is great peril to trust in none / For the
deuylle is to subtle to tempte the flesh / which is young and lusty /
wherefore men ought to keep hem self well and take the most seurest wey / whereof
I would ye wist hou it happed to an evil wife / which was wife to a roper or
cable maker / serving for ships and great vessels upon the sea / and was
dwelling in a good town /

Of the roper or maker of cords and kables and of the fat Pryour / Capitulo
lxij
a Man was which of his craft was a Rope maker / and had a wife which was not
wise / and the which kept not her feyth and troth toward him / but falsed it
by the mean of a falls bawd / which for a little silver made her to sin and
play with a pryour / that was Rich / and a great lechour / And so for the
couetyse of a little gift and a little Jewel the said euylle Bawd maade her to
fall in a myschaunt and euylle deed / wherefore the sage says / She that takes
/ sells her self / It happed ones / that this Pryour was come by night and
lay with her / And as he issued out of the chamber / the fire began to
brenne / and gaf light / And then her husbond saw him how he went out /
whereof he was affrayed / and said he had seen sum man within the chamber /
His wife made semblaunt as she thereof were affrayed / and said it was the fend
or else the goblyn or sum spyryte / But notwithstondyng her saying / the
good man was thereof in great trytesse and in great melancolye / The wife which
was malycious and subtyle went anon to another her godsep her neighbor and
bawd / and brought her home with her The bawd then saw the good man went
about the hows / berynge with him the cordaylle / wherewith he he made his
cords / She took in her hands a spynroke with black wolle and began to
spynne / And as he was coming again toward her she took another with white
wolle / Then said to her the good man which was a plain man and true / My
godsep me seemed/ that right now ye spanne black wolle / Ha a said she my
Godsep / Verily I did not so / Then went he fro her again / and as he
turned again toward her / and that she had taken the other spynrock he looked
on her / and began to say / Have fair godsep / ye had incontinent a
spynrock with white wolle / Ha fair godsep what ayleth the now In good feyth It
is not so / I see well / that ye be dasewed and sore dyseased of your syghte and
wit / And in truth men wene sometime to see a thing that they see not / Ye
be thoughtfull / and right pensyf / certainly / ye have sum thing that
hurts you / And the good man that thought she said truth said to her / by
god godsep me thought that this last night I saw some body that issued out of
our chamber / Ha a my good godsep and friend said the old and falls woman / Hit
was nothing but the day / and the night / that so bestourned your sight /
Then was the good man well apayed by the falsenes of the old woman / and wend
verily she had said troth Afterward it befell another time to him / as he
supposed to take at his beds feet a pouche or sack / for to have gone with /
at a market three mile thens / but he took with him the pryours breche / and put
them under his arms / And then when he came to the market and wend to have
taken his pouche or little sak / he took the pryours breche / And as he saw
that / he was sore troubled and wroth of hit / And the pryour that was voyded
and hid under the bed / wend to have take his breche / but he fond none /
sauf the pouche or sak allone / and then he knew well / that the good man
had them with him Then was his wife at a great meschyef / and wist not what to
do / she went to her godsep again / and told her all the matter and fayt / And
that she for gods sake would find some remedy to it / She said to her ye
shall take a pair of breches / And I shall take also another pair / and
shall tell him / that all wymmen were them / And so they did / Then
perceived him the false godseb and saw him come / She went and welcomed him and
asked him what chere good godsep quod she I doubt that ye have fond some
evil adventure or that ye have lost sum thing whereof ye be so sad / Verily
said the good man / I have lost no thing / but well I have other thought / she
did so much that he told her all the matere how that he had found a pair
of breches at her beds feet / And when she herd him say thus / she began to
lawghe and said / Ha my godsep / Now I see well that ye be deceived and in the
weye to be dampened / For in good feythe in all this town is none better than
is your wife / ne that more feythfully and clenly keeps her self toward her
husbond / than she does toward you / And to put you out of suspecion /
truth hit is that she and I / and many other of this Town good wymmen and
true have take each of us a pair of breches / and were them for these
lechours and putyers / that forced and will do their wylles of good wymmen /
And to the end ye know if I lie or say truth / look if I were them or not /
She took up her clothes and showed him the breche / And he beheld and saw
that she said truth / and byleued her / And so by such manner the false godsep
had saved his wife twyes / But at the last al euylle will be known / The good
man ones saw his wife goo in to the said pryours hows allone / whereof he was
full angry and sorrowful / In so much that Incontynently he deffended her and
warned her upon pain of lysynge of her eye / that never she should be so hardy
to goo ne converse in the hows of the said pryour / But nevertheless she might
never hold her self there fro / For the great temptacion that the fend gaf her
/ It becam ones that the good man made semblau^t to goo out and played And
hyded him self in a secret place / And soon after his fool wife went in to
the pryours hows / And her husbond followed her pas by pas / and brought her
again / and told her / that euylle she had kept his commandment / wherefore
he beat her / and brake both her legs / Then went she in to the Town /
and made covenant with a Cyrurgyen to hele and set again fast to gyder two
broken legs / And when this covenant was made / he came again to his hows
/ and took a stamper / and brake the two legs of his wife / saying to her / At
the lest shall thou hold a while my covenant / and shall not go ageynste my
deffence there as it pleases me not / And when he had thus done / he took and
leyd her in a bed and there she was a great while without departing / and at
last the fend mocked her / as ye herd to fore / For he made her ever to seek
so many of foul plesaunces in her folly / and in her foul sin / that he
might not chastyse her thereof / but when she was amended of her legs / came
the Pryour secretly to her / But the good man herd him come / and doubted him
self / and made semblaunt of sleep and routed / And at the last so much he
was herynge them / that he herd / how he disported him self with his wife
accomplysshynge and doing the foul sin of lecherye / and he tasted about /
and found well that the deed was true / And then he wexed so much angry /
and wroth thereof that al most he was out of his memory and wit / And drew
out a great knyf with a sharp point / and cast a little straw within the
fire / and ran to them lightly / And he killed them both at ones / And
when he had done this deed / he called to him his meyne and his neighbors /
and showed them the faytte or deed And sent also for the Iustyse of which he
was excused / And had no harm / Right much merueylled the neighbors how
she had turned her heart to love such a pryour / which had so great a
belly / and so thycke and fat / so black and so foul of face and so
vncurteys as he was / And her husbond was fair and good / sage and rich / But
many wymmen ben like and of the nature of the she wulf / that is the female of
the wulf / which takes and cheseth to her love the most foul and lothly wolf
/ And so does the folysshe wife by the temptacion of the fend / that ever
incessauntly is about the synnar / bet man or wife / to make them to fall in
dedely sin / Aind as the sin is gretter the more he has might and
puyssaunce over the synnars / And by cause he was a man of Relygyon / and the
woman wedded was the sin gretter / And for certain by the holy scripture and
writing / and as men may al about see / if a woman accomplysshe or do that
sin of lechery with one her kynne and nygh of her blood / she shall be the
more temptyd and shall be more brennyng and to it shall have more folyssh
appetyte and evil plesau^ce / and therefore it is true that so often is the pot
borne to fetch water / that at last it breketh in pyeces / For this
folysshe wife / which had a husbond / ten times fayrer than the Monk was and
more curteys and gracious And that so often had escaped thorugh her falls
Godseps delynge / And that upon the defense of her husbond went again to the
pryours hows / as ye herd to fore / And ouermore as the great anguysshe and
dolor that she had suffered of her legs was past / yet she ne would chastyse
ne keep her self clean of that foul sin of lechery / Then is it thing
true and approuued / that all this is but temptacion of the deuylle / which
holds and keeps the synnars with brennynge and enflammed hertes / to the end
he may do them to fall within his grynnes or nets as he did the said fool
woman and to the said pryour / and made them both to receive death vylaynysly /
Now have I showed unto you by many ensamples of the bible / and of the kings
gestes also by other writing / How the sin of lechery and the desguysynge
and werynge rayments and clothes of new facion / is much displeasynge to god
/ And how the deluge and assemblyng of waters came thereof / and all the world
perysshed sauf only eight persons And how Sodom and Gomorre with five other
cytees were also burnt and conbusted unto thabismes by fire of sulphur and of
fouldre / And how so many euylles / werres / famyns and pestylences and other
trybulacions / ben thereof come / and be coming day by day in this world /
And how the stenche of hit is so gretely displeasynge to the angels of heaven /
And how the holy vyrgyns that been in heaven in joy and glory gaf them self to
martyrdom rather than they should consent to hit ne goo fro their good / holy
and pure will for any yeftes ne for promesses / as it is contained in their
legendes / as of saint katheryn / saint Margaryte / of saint Crystyn / the
enleuen thousand vyrgyns and of many other / of which the great constaunce and
feruente courage of them / were to long to be recounted / For they surmou^ted
many great temptacions and vaynquysshed many tyrau^ts / whereby they gate and
conquered the great reame of bliss and glory / where as they shall ever be
in perdurable joy / Now my fair daughters I tell you that no thing or little
is to keep him self clenly / It is / dread and be of hertely loving toward her
lord / and think what euylle what shame / and what dolor and sorrow comes
thereof unto the world / and how hit displeases god / And how thereof men lose
both body and soul the love of god / and the love of his parents and friends
/ and of the world / wherefore much affectuelly I pray you / as my right dear
daughters / that ye day and night will think on it / For many great and euylle
temptacions shall befyght and assaylle you / Be ye then strong and valiant
to resist and overcome them / And look and behold the place wheroute ye be
come of / and what dishonor and shame might come to you thereof

Of Apomena queen of Surye / Capitulo lxiij
nOw shall I tell you of sum wymmen / the which ben ouermoche proud of
their great worship and goodes^ which god has given them / As reherced is in
the bylle / there was a woman which Was named Apomena / daughter of a simple
knight named Bernard / This Apomena was fair and young / in so much that the
king of Surye / Which was a mighty king was enamoured of her and so much
that he loved her that by his great folly he took her in marriage and made her
queen / And when she saw her self so high and so mighty / and in so great
honor and worship brought / she set naught syn of her friends and parents
and had shame and desdayne to see or mete with hem / And became over proud and
so much great of courage that also to the king her lord she bare not so great
reverence as she ought to have do / by cause she saw him simple and debonayr
/ And also she / by her great pride / dayned not bear reverence ne worship to
none of the kings parents / And so much she did that of every one she was
hated and that the king was wroth with her and chaced / and sent her in
exyle / And so by great pride she lost the great honor and worship where in of
low degree she had fortunatly be brout / for many wymmen be yt may not suffer
ease and worship to gyder / and can not rest till by their pride and envy they
fall in great pouerte / and fro hyhe to low as did the folysshe queen wh^che
was come fro low degree unto so high and mighty estate and might not suffer
it / And every woman when she sees and knows her board simple and debonayr to
her / she ought the more to bear him honor and worship / for so doing she
worshippeth and bears honor to her self / and has the love of them that
sees her so do / And also therefore she ought to hold her the more cloos and
symplya / nd to force her self to keep his love and his pees / For all hertes be
not ever in one estate / A stone slyteth / And a horse falls / Men wene
sometime that such one be simple / which has a malycious heart / And therefore
a woman may not bear to much worship and honor to be^ lord / ne to much be
obeyssaunt to him / of what someuer condition he be / whereof I will tell you
an ensample of the wife of the great Herodes / He had a wife which he
ouermoche loved He went to Rome / And in the mean while hit befelle / that his
men that were with him / the which in no wise loved their lady his wife / by
cause she was toward them to proud and felon / told him how she had a prince
to her love / whereof Herodes was wroth / and at his return fro Rome he
reprouued her of this great fault and vylonye / which she had done to him /
She answered then to proudely and to lightly / And had not her lord in honor
by fair words ne by curtosye / neither humbly she spoke to him / as she
ought to have do / And therefore her lord / that was felon and despytous / and
wroth of her proud and high speaking took a knyf / and slew her / whereof he
was after sorry / For he fond not that tale which his men had told him of her
true / And so her pride / and ouermoche langage was cause of her death ^ And
therefore this ensample is very good to every woman to see / how she ought to be
meke and humble and curtois in gyuyng any answer against the ire and wrath of
her lord / For the wise Salamon says that by curtosye and by sweet langage
ought the good wymmen to refreyne the ire and wrath of their lord / For the
lord of right ought to have above his wife the high talkyng / be it ryt or
wrong / and specially in his ire / and wrath / and before any folk / but as his
wrath is gone she may well show to him yt he had no cause so to do / and so she
shall ever hold the love and pees of her lord and of all her hows / neither she
shall not make her self to be blamed / ne to be beat / ne slain by her lord /
as did the wife of king Herodes

Of the queen Vastis Capitulo lxiiij /
I Shall tell you another ensample of a queen that was named vastys / She was
wife to the king Assuerus It befelle / that the king held a feste with his
barons and there were all the great lords of his land / They satte at dinner
in a hall and the queen in another / And when the barons had dyned they prayed
the king that he would vouchesauf to show them the queen which was
merueyllously fair / The king sent for her ones / twyes and thryes / but
never she daygned to come / whereof the king had great shame / and demanded of
his barons counceylle what thereof he might best do / And such was the
counceylle given / that is to wete that he should put her fro him / and made her
to be lockked and shette bitwene two wallys that every other should take thereby
ensample to be better obedyent to their lord than she was / And so after their
counceyll did the king his wife to be mured / and hereof he made a law / that
fro thens forthon al wymmen yt should of any thing wythsaye and be disobebedyent
to her lord / seeing that it be reasonable / that she should be a year within two
wallys / and with litil mete and drink for her defaute / And as yet they keep
and hold that custom in that land / The queen that saw her put in mewe was
sore ashamed and wept and sorowed much / but it was to late / For
notwithstondynge her mourning and lamentacion she was put in prison as above
is said where she was a year / Therefore well ye ought to take here good ensample
/ For specially before folk ye ought to do the commaundment of your lord /
and obeysshe and bear him honor / and ever show him semblau^t of love if ye
will have the love of him and of the world / But I say not as ye shall be
pryuely and allone one by other / but that ye may eslargysshe your self to say
or do your will / after the best wise that ye may / and after ye know his
manners I shall tell you thensample of the lion and of his propryete / As the
lioness that is to understand the female of the lion has done the lion any
fault or despyte / he shall not go with her / but fro her shall keep him self
one day and a night / And so shows he his lordship and seygnorye that he
has over the lioness / This ensample is fair and profitable to all wymmen /
considering how a savage and wyld be and without reason / and that does /
but as nature enclyneth her / makes her self to be draw / and doubted of
felawe

Of a man and of his wife / capitulo lxv
aNd yet I shall tell you another ensample upon this matere / There was one
Amon which was the kings Seneschal / and came of naught and low degree / He
bicame thorugh his seruyse much rich and bought lands and possessions and
governed / and had as under him almost the half of the reame / And when he
saw him so rich / And that he was bicome so great a lord / he wexyd / and
bicame over proud and felon and presumptuous^ and would / that men should knele
before him / and that every one should bear unto him honor and reverence / It
befelle that one Mardocheus that was a noble man which had nourysshed the noble
queen Hester / which was a good lady and true / was above al other displeased
of the pride and presumpcion of the said Amon which come of naught / therefore
she daygned not to bear him any reverence / ne knele before him as other did /
wherefore he bicame as a fool / and almost out of his wit for anger / and
thereof did complain him self to his wife / And his wife that of so hyhe courage
was and as proud was as he counceylled him that he should make a gallows to be
set and dressyd before his place / and that he should make him and his wife to
be taken and honged thereon to great meschyef / And that he should accuse them of
some great treason and falshede / And when he was take / and the gallows
dressyd / the friends of mardocheus went anon rennynge to the queen Hester /
and told her how Aaman would make him to be hanged that had nourysshed her /
And anon the queen made to be sent for Aaman / he came / and she had him
tofore the king Where as truth of the fayte or deed was dylygently Inquyred
and known / In so much that it was found that Mardocheus was accused by the
accusacion of Aaman and was nothing gylty / And that such treason he had
put on him was by envy / and then the good and noble queen Hester kneled
before her lord the king / and required and prayed him / that such Justice
should be made of Aaman the Seneschalle as he would it had be done of Mardocheus
and of his wife / And that he should be hanged at the yate of his place / to
show that falsely and by envy he had accused Mardocheus of treson / And as the
good queen did require her lord / so was hit done / Thus was hanged Aaman by
his great pride and sur^uedrye / And by the counceylle of his wife / Wherefore
great folly is to a man come fro low degree to Worship and great estate to
become and wexe proud and surquydous for erthely good / that he has gadred
and amassed / and to myspryse any other / but if he be wise / he ought him self
show to every one meke and humble / to the end he may fall in the grace and
welwyllynge of all folk and that none may have envy over him / For comynly
men have more envy over them / that been come of naught to great worship / than
of them that been come of rich and noble folk and of Auncestrye / The wife of
Aaman was not wise when she saw the ire and wrath of her lord to sustain
him in his folly / for every good woman and wise ought by fair and curtoys
speaking put aweye if she may the ire and Wrath of her lord / and specially
When she sees him meued and be Willing to do sum euylle or sum shameful
deed / Whereof dommage and dishonor may to them come / as did Aamans wife /
which repreuyd not her lord of his folly / but gaf him folysshe and euylle
counceyll Whereby he did vylaynously / Men ought not to sustain his lord in his
Wrath and ire / but curtoysly and by fair Words men ought to repreue him of
his euylle thought / and show unto him lytyl and lytyl the reasons and cause
why he should not do as he had purposed to do / For Which thing my fair
daughters I require and pray you / that ye here take good ensample / and take heed what meschyef befelle to Aaman by the folysshe counceylle of his wife /

Of the queen Gesabel which had many euylle condycions / Capitulo lxvj /
nOw will I tell you thexample of an eu^lle / cruel / and diverse queen / how
it befelle to her / It was the queen Gesabel / which had many evil ratc^^^ /
First she hated the Indygent / and power / she hated the holy and good
heremytes and al prestes and men of holy (...) / and all them that to the lay
people taught the feyt^^ (...) made them to be beten and robbed / in so much
that of ne^^ they must void / and goo out of the reame / she had of none
mercy ne pity / wherefore she was cursed / and hated of god ^ and of all the people
/ A good man was at that time / whic^^ was named Nabor / which had an Aker of
a vineyard right fertyle and good / which the king coueyted and desired
much to have it by byenge / or otherwise / but the good man Nabor consented
not to hit with good will / The king told to this queen his wife that he was
right sorry / that he might not have that vyneyerd / And she said / that well
she should make that he should have it / as she did / For by treson she made the
good man Nabor to be murdered and slain / And then she brought forth / and
made to come falls men / which wytnessid that he had given the king Achas her
lord his vyneyerd / which thing was much displeasynge to god wherefore he
sent Iosue to make werre against him / in so much he took prisoner the king
Achas / and with him lx children / great and small / And anon after Iosue made
their bedes to be smyton of / This was the punycion of the vengeance dyuyne /
And as for the euylle and cruel queen gesabell I shall tell you the end of
her / She went up unto a hyhe portayll or yate where as Iosue should pass /
and there she coynted and arrayed her with clothes of gold / and flourynge of
rich ermyns with great ple^te of precious stones / al desguysed and in other
manner of clothing than any other woman of that land was / And as she saw the
king go by the way / she bigannne of a high voys to curse him and all his
lygnage also / and proudely she spoke to him saying of him all the vylonye that
her cruel and proud heart couthe think / The king* then began to look up
and saw the couetyse and desguysynge of her and herd her proud / and shameful
Words / whereof he was merueylled and wroth / And seeing she h^ld not her falls
and venymed tongue / but cursed / and ever spoke euylle / commanded to his men
/ that they should go where as she was / And that they should cast her before
all the people the heed dounward fro the place where she was unto the street /
And so they did / And thus by her cruel courage and pride she shamefully and
vylaynsly ended her life / And for the great crueltees and euyls that she in her
life had done and made to be done commanded king Iosue that she should have
sepulcre / but that she should be eten and devoured of dogs / as she was / By
such ways god takes vengeance of time of them / that have no pity of the
power and Indygent / And that love not his church and his servants / and
that by couetyse make great crueltees and many euylle deeds / and also them
that bring falls wytnes to disheryte other of his right / as did the false queen
gesabel / which sustained her lord in his folly / wherefore euylle happed to her
/ Here ye may take ensample to be pyteous charytable toward the pour folk /
and to love holy church and the mynystres of hit / and al so to keep him self
fro gyuynge any euylle counceyl to her lord Also to take no desguysed raiment /
but only thestate of the good nd worshipful wymmen of the land

Of Athalia queen of Iherusalem / Capitulo lxvij
I Athalye will tell you another ensample of a queen of Jerusalem / which
was of evil condycions / diverse and without pity / For when Ozias her sone
was deed / she made all the children of her sone to be slain and all his
heirs also / sauf only one that a good man named Zoadis made to be nourysshed
secretly / This queen took the possession of all the reame and goods / And
made unto the people great dyuersytees and sore trauaylled them / and she taxed
them so high / that they became pour / And as she had so trauaylled the reame
/ as she that was without reason and pity / the child / which had be
secretly nouriss^^d and brought up came to his enherytaunce / and took the
queen Athalia / and made her to deye of an evil and shameful death / And so
she had at the last the reward and guerdon of her merit / For god gives to
every one the deserte of his meryt^ in his life or after his death / For none
euylle is done but (...) shall be punysshed soon or in time to come / I would
(...) daughters that ye knew thensample and the tale of a (...) of France /
which had to name Brunehault / She was the queen / of whom Sybile prophesyed
/ saying thus / Brun^hault shall come fro black Spain in to the Reame of Gaul
France which shall do many euylle deeds / and afterward she shall be destroyed
/ And so it befelle / For she made sum of her children to be slain / and
also the sons of her children and other great crueltees she procured / and
did / which were to long to be reherced / But at the last as hit pleasyd god
s^e was paid / For a child that escaped her cruelte which was sone to her sone
/ and the which knew the great crueltees and abhomynaltees that she had done
and procured and maade to be done / accused her / And then al her fayttes and
deeds were put to Judgment before all the barons of the land / and sentence of
death was cast on her / that she should be bounden with the here is of her head
at horse taylle / And thus it was done And so she deyed of an evil and
shameful death

Of Envy Capitulo lxviij
I Will tell you an ensample of Envy / which is an evil vice / of Marye the
suster of Moses / the which said that she was as well beloved of god as her
brother Moses / and that god herd her prayers and requests as he did his /
whereof god was wroth with her / and made her to become lepre / in so much
she was put out of the town / so that she might no more come among the
folk / And not withstanding her great envy / yet had Moses and Aaron / pity
of her / and made request that it would please him to hele and gwerysshe her /
And at their request god maade her hole again / Take ye here ensample how
great parylle is to have envy of other men's preferement and worship / And how
god did punysshe this lady which was the most noble damoysel that was in all
the land /

Of the content that was between Fenenna and Anna Capitulo lxix
I Would fair daughters that ye knew another ensample upon this matere of a
wife to a great lord / which was named Helchana / Which had two wives after
the law of the land / the one was named Anna / and the other Fenenna / Of Anna
Helchana might have no children / whereof Fenenna was full glad and ioyeful / For
wives that bare no children were less preysed / than they that bare any /
Fenenna scorned and mocked Anna / and called her berhayn / And was over proud
that she had of her lord many fair children / And Anna had none / Anna often
wept and sorowed / and complained her to god / And god which her pacyence and
humylyte beheld / and saw the scornynge and mocking of Fenenna / took al her
children fro her^ And made Anna to wexe great with child / and many one she
had of her lord afterward / wherefore Helchana loved her more than he did
Fenenna / to whom her children were al deed / And thus ben the Iugements of
god merueyllous / For he hates all manner of envy / And chastyseth the proud
when him list / and enhau^ceth the meke and humble that requires him of mercy
/ And therefore ye have here a good ensample / how no woman ought to wexe proud
of the goods and graces that god gyue^h to her / and not to have envy of any
other goods ne to be glad and ioyefull of the meschyef of other / As Fenenna
was / of that she saw her have many children / and Anna none / And therefore god
punysshed her over her children / For they deyde euerychone / And gaf sum to
her that to fore had none / Such ben the Iugements of god / therefore men ought
well to take here ensample / and thank god of al his bienfaittes / Here I leave
this matere / And shall tell you of another upon the faytte or deed of
couetyse /

Of Dalida the euylle wife / Capitulo l^^
I Shall tell you another Ensample upon the faytte or deed of an euylle wife
and a falls woman / whic^e was named Dalida / which was wife of Sampson / that
much loved her / in so much that he did nothing but that he made her to
know hit / And for the great love that he had to her / he like a fool
discovered and told her that al his (...) was in the heerys of the heed / And
when the false wo^a^ wist it / she made to tell the paynyms which were
enemies to her lord / that if they would give her a good reward she should so do
/ that they should take him / And anon the paynyms promised her that if she
couthe so do / as she said / they should give her a great quantite of gold and
of gowns / and as many precious stones as she would take of them / And she that
thorugh couetyse was deceived / made her lord to sleep in her lap / And while
he fast slepte / she cut awey the heerys of his heed / And anon sent for
the paynyms / which nyghe were embusshed / and made him to be taken of them /
Then he awoke and fond all his might and strength lost and gone that
before that time was wont to resist and fight he al one against three thousand
men / And when they had him fast bounden / they thrested and put out
both his eyes And made him to turn about a mylle as a blind horse / Behold
ye then and look how couetyse deceived this folissh woman that for a little
gold bitrayed her lord / that so much loved her / which was most doubted of
all m^n / that ever were and ever shall be / A coueytous heart dar well say
and undertake to do much euylle / For he makes the noble men to be rapynous
and tyrau^ts over their men and subgettes / Couetyse also makes many thieves /
many usurers / many murderers many maidens and wydowes to become harlottes /
and many secret homycyde is done by this false vice of couetyse / the ^hildren
also to desire and wysshe the death of their faders and moders only for to
have and rauysshe their goods after their death / Also Judas for couetyse of
silver he bitrayd our lord Ihesu Christ / In such manner done these days the
advocates and men of law / which sellen their talkyng and words tornynge fro
the truth / and pletynge against hit / For they do the right of the good man
to be dylayed for to have and take of him more silver / And many one of them is
that takes on both parties / And so they selle their speech / which god gaaf
them to prouffyte with for the common well / Therefore is couetyse much
deceyuable / which brought the wife of Sa^pson to do great folly / Here ye have
good ensample to keep your self fro the vice of couetyse / For soon after god
sent to the said dalida the deserte of her merit and deed / She took to
spouse one of the paynyms / and made a great feste / Sampson that knew of it /
And to whom his here is were grown and his strength come again / made him to
be led there as they were set at the dinner / And then he took the pyler
in his arms which stood in the myddell of the halle / and that sustained and
bare all the place / and shoke it with so great strength and might that he
brake it in to pyeces / and the place fylle upon them / there was slain dalida
/ her new lord and the most part of them that were at that dinner / And thus
Sampson venged him of dalida his false wife / which was there punysshed of her
euylle deed and folly / And well was reason and right that of evil doing /
evil should come to her /

How a Woman ought not to depart ne goo fro her husbond for any Wrath or evil
will that may grow or come emonge them / Capitulo lxxj
I will tell you how of a little wrath sourded and came great evil / A good
man was which was noble / and of the mount Euffraym / he married him / and took
a damoysell of Bethlehem the which for a little occacion was wroth with her
husbond / and went again to her faders hows / The good man her husbond was
thereof heavy and sorrowful / and went and did fetch her home again / And her
fader blamed her and said she did not as a good wife should do / As they were
going homeward / they lodged in a town named galga / where as was many
worldly folk full of lechery / This folk came there where as this woman and her
lord were lodged / they brake the doors and by force and vyolence vylaynsly
took and rauysshed the said woman fro her husbond / and for nothing that their
host could say or do / which would have given one of his daughters for the
warauntyse of his hostess / they would not leave her / but had her with them.
And as the morning came / she that saw her dishonored and so vylaynsly shamed
/ took in her self such shame and such a sorrow that she then deyde at her
lords feet / wherefore the good man was nyghe deed also / and as he was come to
him self again / he took and bare her body unto his hows / and then be made
xij pyeces of her body / and upon every pyece he set^e a paper leef / wherein
was wreton all the manner how it befelle to her and sent these xij pyeces to xij
persons her parents and most nyhe of her kyn to the end they should among them
take vengeance of it / whereof it befelle that all her friends and her
husbondes friends also took thereof so great ire and wrath / and had so great
abhomynacion of it / yt they gadred and assembled them to gyder / and with
great no^bre of men of arms / came to galga / and slew th^r well xxxiijM
persons men and wymmen / This is to you a good ensample / how a woman ought
not to leave her husbond and lord for none ire ne maltalent that may be bitwene
them / and a wise and good woman out to bear and suffer the ire and wrath of
her husbondes in the most fair and humble wise that she can and to put her self
in pain to appease him by curtoys and fair words / and not leave and go fro
him / as did the said damoysel / which left her lord / and went fro him /
and her husbond must fetch her ageyn By the which her going she deyd / and
so did many one / as above is said / And if she had be in pees and still with
her lord / all this great euylle and sorrow had not fallen / And therefore it is
sometime good to refreyne her / ire and amolysshe her heart / For this is the
usage of the wise woman / which tends to live peasybly and louyngly with her
husbond and lord

How a woman ought to obey her husbond in all thing honest Capitulo lxxij
I Would ye knew well the tale and example of the lady / which daygned not to
come to her dinner for any commandment that her lord could make to her / and
so many time he sent for her / that at the last when he saw she would not
come at his commandment / he made to come before him his swyneherd / he that
kept his swynes / which was foul / and ouermoche hydous / and bad him fetch
the clowte of the kechyn wherewith men wype dysshes and platers And then he
made a table or board to be dressyd before his wife / and made it to be couerd
with the said cloute / and commanded to his swyneherd to sytte beside her /
And then he said thus to her / Lady if ye ne will ete with me / ne come at
me / ne come at my commandment / ye shall have the kepar of my swyne to hold
you company and good felauship / And this cloute to wype your hands with all /
And when she that then was sore ashamed and more wroth than she was tofore
saw and knew that her lord mocked her / refreyned her proud heart and knew
her folly / Therefore a woman ought not in no wise to refuse to come at the
commandment of her lord if she will have and keep his love and pees / And
also by good reason humylyte ought to come first to the woman / For ever she
ought to show her self meke and humble toward her lord /

How men ought to keep hem self fro flaterers / Ca lxxiij
hEre shall I tell you an ensample of a great lady named Susanna / that had a
sone a great lord / which was gone in to a feld or batayll^ / where he wa^
slain / The mother was in great thought and sorrow what tidings she should here
of him / In her company she had a woman a flateresse and a great liar / which
often said to her / Madame be not in no wise desmayed ne sorrowful / ^o my lord
your sone has victory upon his enemies / therefore he must tarry and abide there
a while for to ordeyne of his affaryre^ / and so this false flateresse appeased
her lady of fair words naught / For she ne said never to her lady any word
that might displease her / as done many flaterers and many flateresses / which
shall never sa^e thing that may displease their ladies or lords / and s^alle
hyde the truth / and their well and make them to have io^e of naught / As did
this false woman to that good lady / Which made her to understand / that her
sone had obtained vyctory / and brought With him his prisoners / And well hit
was the contrary / For he deyde there / wherefore it befell that when the lady
his mother knew it / she deyde nyghe for sorrow / therefore is an euylle thing to
a man to have about him any flaterers / For they dare not give true
counceylle / but often they make their lords to do great folly / They be like
to the Iouglours which will make of a cole seem and show a fair thing / For
they preyse a thing before the folk / and behind them they blame hit / wherefore
one ought not to believe that / what they sayen / For they retche not what they
say / but that they may please you and to have your love / And if ye be wise /
ye ought to know them better / than they shall you / and put them fro you and
take such one that shall tell you the truth and your well / Such flaterers
deceive the rich men / as did a flaterer to a woman that sold cheses / which
was foul of vysage / and he made her to understand / that she was fair and
praty / And the woman was so folyssh that she wend he had said truth /
Sometime she gaf him a chese / and as he had it and was behynd her bak he
mocked her of it / I would ye wist thexample / which I saw in the town of
Angolosme / as the duk of normandy came before Aguyllon / there were knytes which
for to take their disp^rte shot at a mark / And when the duke came in to
the wherein was the holy bread of the manna which came and descended fro heaven /
whereof the holy faders were refressh^ and filled / that for to worshipe god and
the feste / the king went and put him self among the prestes for to sing and
harp with them / and made the grettest joy that he could for the love and
worship of god and of his church / His wife looked on him that so deed / and had
of it great desdayne and shame / and mocked him saying that he was bicome a
mynystrelle And the good king answered that one may not to much meke ne humble
him self toward god / ne do to much worship and reverence to his church / For
of god comes all the good and honor that man and woman may have / And
therefore god was displeased of that she had spoken of it / and made her barayn
and seek by cause he would show to her her folly / For every good woman ought
to Incyte and mean her lord to worship god and the church / and not mock him
of that he does in the worship of god / For as the sage says in the book of
sapyence / when the man sees him mocked and scorned / specially / before any
folk of his wife / his heart swells / which causes him to answer
outrageously / And therefore it is good to a woman to be of fair and sweet
speaking in repreuynge her lord of any thing

How a woman ought not to require of her husbond any thing but it be honest
and profitable to them both / Capitulo lxxvj
aN ensample shall I tell you of Bersabee the wife of Vrye which duellyd
before the palais of king david This Bersabee ones kembed and wesshed her here
at a wyndowe where as king david might well see her / She had over fair here is /
wherefore the king was tempted and sent for her / and so much he did that he
lay with her / and by cause of the folyssh plesaunce and delight that he took
with her / He did send his lettres to Ioab which was Chyuetayne and capitayn
of his host / that he should put Vrye in such place that he might be slain /
Vrye bare him self the lettres of his death / For in certain it was done as
the king had wreton / And thus king dauyd made double sin / for an homycyde
he was / and had accomplysshed and done the sin of lecherye / wherefore god
was displeased / and sent to him and to his reame many euyls / whereof the
nombre were to long to reherce / And all this meschyef came by the pride that
bersabee had of her heart / Therefore a woman ought not to be proud of any
beauty that she has / show her self only to please the world /

The demand or askyng that the mother of Salamon made / Capitulo lxxvij
tHe mother of king Salamon which was a good lady did require of Salamon her
sone / that he would grant and feaunce her to a man / which was a paynym and
their enemy / Salamon ansuerd that this enemy should never have the wife of his
lord his fader / She held her then for nyce and ashamed of that she had be
warned of her demand and request / Therefore every woman ought to think or
she require her lord of any thing if her request be reasonable or not / I would
ye knew the folysshe request which the duchess of Athenes made to the duke
her lord / She had a bastard sone / And therefore she made her request to her
lord / that he might have to his wife his own suster / And the duk that saw
her symplenes / began to lawghe and dyssymyled her request / and said that
he should speak with his Friends of it / She then that would fayn have seen
this marriage to be couenaunted and granted rested not to speak to her lord of
it / tylle at the last he said to her / that it should not be done wherefore she
took such a sorrow in her heart that she lay seek thereof / the duk prayed her
/ and also made her to be prayed by other to come and lie with him / but she
would not / wherefore the duke was wroth / and he swear and said that never she
should lie in his bed / and made her to be conveyed in a castle / Here is
then a good ensample / how a woman ought to beware her self that she require
not her lord of nothing unreasonable or dishonest / and hou yt she must obey
him / and not do like as ye duchess of Athenes did / wherefore her lord exyled
and put her fro him /

The Judgment of the king Salamon / capitulo lxxviij
I Will tell you an Ensample of a falls woman / two wymmen were sometime /
which both were lodged in one hows^ and each of them had a sone / which
children were both seek / and both borne upon one day / It befell on a night
that one of them was by adventure smouldred / His mother that saw him deed went
anon as a falls woman and took the other child which lived / and in her
cradell leyd her sone which was deed / And he that lived she leyd in her
cradel / And then when the other woman came to see and take heed to her
child / and saw him that was deed / she anon knew that it was not her sone /
whereof sourded a great content and stryf between these two wymmen / In so much
that the cause and matere was brought to fore Salamon / And after he had herd
their debate and stryf / he said / let a swerd be brought hyder / And I shall
part this child in two and give to each of them one half / She to whom the
child apperteyned not answered and said she was content / And she that was mother
of the child said / Rather than it should be done / I have lever to quytte you
and give you my part / so that his life may be saved / Then the king Iuged
that the child should be given to her / that would have him to be saved / And so
was the treason of the false woman approuued and known

How the sin of the fader is noyus to his Children Capitulo lxxix
aNother ensample was of the wife of king Roboam / She had a child which was

he would Impetre to god the health of their child / The queen went to him / And
as she was come to fore the door of his hows / And or ever he saw her / by the
grace of the holy ghost he knew what she was and also what she would / and said
to her with a high voys / Queen wife to Roboam your sone deyd this night of a
good death / But all thine other children shall deye of euylle death / by
cause of the sin of their fader / thyn husbond / which is a tyrant over his
people / lecherous and of euylle conscience / The queen went again homeward /
and fond her sone cold and deed / and told her lord what he had said / but
therefore he amended him not / wherefore perysshed all his children / And thus is
here a good ensample to use and keep honest life / and to love and kep^ in

How none ought to repreue other of his meschyef Capitulo lxxx
I Shall tell you another ensample / how Anna the wife of Thobye spoke
folysshly to her lord / which was a good and a holy man / and buried the deed
bodies / which a paynym made to be slain in the despyte of god and of his law
/ the which was called Senacherib / It fort^^^d that the swalowe did foul
within the eyes of Thobye / and a long time he was blind / wherefore his wife said
to him as ^n great despyte I am merueyled / how the god for whoos love ye take
so great pain to burye these deed bodies / gives not your sight again / The
good man had pacyence / and ansuerd that of al thing he may do his pleasyr /
wherefore it fortuned to her that she was sore punysshed by sickness / whic^e
god sent her / And as the pleasyr of god was Thobye ^a^de his sight restored
again / And thus by this ensample none good woman ought to mock or scorn her
husbond / ne preyse him the less for any sickness or trybulacion that god
sende^^ him / For as well is the axe or swerd lift over the ho^^ as over the
seek / as ye have herd of Thobye / which was heled of his eyes / and his wife
by cause of her folysshe speaking / fell in a great sickness / wherefore I will
that ye know thensample of Sara / which had seven husbondes / the whic^e the
devil slew / by cause they would use her of an enorme and over foul faytte /
of which it neded not to be spoken of / This by the smallyst worm that might
be found in the world / I have spoken and told unto you of the euylle wymmen
after hit is contained within the bible for to be unto you and other an
ensample for to keep and beware you of euylle doing / Now I shall traytte and
tell unto you of the good wymmen / the which holy writing preyseth much /
And therefore it is good to record and bring to memory the good condycions of
the good wymmen which sometime were the myrrour and exemplary to all other of
that time that now ben and to them that been yet to come / And the first
ensample is of Sarra which the holy scripture or writing preyseth so much

Of the noble woman Sarra which kept her self full clenly Capitulo lxxxij
sArra was wife to Abraham a much good woman and a wise / and god kept her fro
many paryls / For as the king Pharao took her / god did send him so many
euyls / and so much he was trauaylled of sekenes / that of need he must take
and yield her again to her own lord / and so god saved her by cause of her
holiness and good life / As he did keep many saints fro fire and water / and
fro gleues / or wepen / and also fro many other great torments / as is
contained in the books of their life and legendes / For thus saves God them /
that louen him and ben his friends / This Sarra suffered many euyls and great
dolours / She was the space of a honderd year barayn / but by cause of her holy
feyth and for the sure truth that ever she bare unto her lord / and also for
her humylyte / God send and gaf her a sone / which afterward was a good holy
man / It was Isaac of whom the xij lygnees issued and came / and God gaf him
to her for her great bounte

Of the Valiant lady Rebecca the wife of ysaac / Capitulo lxxxiij
aNother ensample I shall tell you of Rebecca which was merueyllously good
and fair / and full of good condycions / The holy writing preyseth much this
Rebecca / as for her great humylyte / She was wife to ysaac and mother of Jacob /
The scripture wytnessyth how she loved and worshipped her lord above al thing /
and showed her to him meke and humble / and ansuerd him swetely / and for to
have be slain she would not have said one word that might have displeased him
/ And by cause of her great humylyte show showed her more to be servant than
lady / She was long time barayne / but god which loves holiness and humylyte
/ gaf and sent to her two children at ones / and at one birth / that were
Ezau and Jacob / of the which Jacob issued twelve children / the which
afterward were princes of the twelve lygnees / of whom thepystle of al hallowen
day makes mention / This Rebecca loved more Jacob / which was the last borne
than she did Esau / she made him to have the blessyng of his fader / as in the
bible is reherced / She loved him best that best couthe cheuysshe him self /
and which was of great purueaunce / She was like the lioness / which of all
her faons she loves best him / that best can purchase for him self / Jacob was
of great purueaunce / And Esau had all his heart set to the chase and to
the veneson / And so the children of one fader and mother ben not of one
condycion / and manner / For some louen one craft and one manner of living and
the other louen another / I shall tell you thensample of a good man and of a
good woman which were long time to gyder without having any children / And at
their request god sent them a much fair sone / And soon after another they
had which was foul and lame / Truth hit is / that they should give to the
Church their first begoten sone / But as they had the second / and saw him so
contrefayt / they said he should be given to the Chirch / And that the fairest
should abide with them for to be their heyr / whereof god was wroth and took
them both / and never syn they had none wherefore they lived in great sorrow /
And therefore is here a good ensample / For none ought to make any promise to
god / but if he will hold and accomplysshe it / and none may mock him as
these would have done in gyuynge to him the fowlest of their two children / and
would have kept the fairest for them and the which they had promised to give
him / Ye shall never see good come thereof to them that so do / Ne to them that
have and take out their sons and their daughters fro the monastery where ones
they were given and received / whereof many ensamples I have seen with mine ey^n
/ as of many / that have be had out of their Abbeyes for the lands and
possessions that to them were coming by the succession of their parents /
which were passed out of this world / And after by couetyse sum made werre
ageynste them / and took by force all that they had fro them / And for
certain I saw never none so had out of the church that might be peasyble /
but at the last he came ever to nout / And as well I say of wymmen / that for
such caas or other were had out fro their monastery / I wist never none / but
that she had an euylle end / For at the last they were dyffamed and vyoled /
and deyde of their children / or otherwise vilaynsly they ended their life And
therefore men ought not take fro god that which is his

I Shall tell you thexample of lya the wife of Jacob The bible preyseth her
much / and says how she loved parfyghtely her lord and the worship that she
bare unto him / And how as god sent to her any child she thanked him thereof
deuoutely / and therefore god gaf her Viij of the xij princes / of whom the
twelve lygnees issued / that so much were good men and dradde and loved god
above al thing And their fader and mother praid ever god for them syn they were
but young / that he would purueye them of his love and of his grace / And he well
herd their prayer / For they were holy men and worshipped above al folk / Here
is then good ensample / hou the faders and moders ought every day to pray god
for their children / as Jacob and Lia did / And yet I say that for no fault ne
ryotte they never cursyd them / but blamed and repreued them by other manner and
deed / And beat them as they deserved hit / For better hit were to beat an
honderd time his children than to curse them ones / whereof I shall tell you an
Ensample of a woman which was yrous and euylle / And lightly she was angry /
And also was her husbond / And by their great ire they were ever chydyng and
brawlyng to gyder / they had a sone / the which had done to them sum fault
/ wherefore the fader and mother began sore to curse him / And the child which
was wroth answered to them folysshly / And then the fader and the mother /
that for his answer were full of ire and wrath went and gaf him to the devil
/ And the fend came that seized and took him by the one hand and lift him up
fro the ground / And where as he touched him / the fire sprang out and lost
his hand / For which ^ause he was al his life in danger and parylle / And
therefore there is great danger in cursynge of his own children / And wysshyng
to them any euylle / and yet gretter peril is to give them by any ire or
wrath to the devil And therefore have ye this ensample in your memory / and
see how ye ought to wysshe ever all good for your children / and pray god for
them as did Jacob and his wife for their children / which god enhaunced over
all the lygnees and generacions / And do not like as did the man and his wife
the which through their ire cursed their child / and after gaf him to the
devil / wherefore the child was in peril all his life during /

aNother ensamps^ I shall tell you of Rachel the second wife of Jacob / which
was mother to Joseph / which his brethren sold in egypt / Of her speaks to
be nourysshed in her wardrobbe more derely / And as in Iape she called him her
sone / of the which came afterward so much good / For god chose and
stablysshed him master and governor over all his people / And also did show
to him many of his secrets / And took him the rod wherewith he departed the sea / and made dry way to pass it^ and made also with that same rod to
issue and come out of the stone l^yuynge and sweet water / And also he took
him the tables of the law / and many other signs and tokens of love he did
show unto him as of his nourysshynge whereof the good lady was well rewarded /
For god forgeteth never the service done to him by charity / as to nourysshe
the orphans or faderles / which is an operacion of Mysericorde / that God
much loved / as hit is contained in ^he life of saint Elysabeth / which
nourisshed the pour Orphans / And maad them to learn sum craft to get
their living with /

Wherefore it befelle that a good woman which had but one chil^d the which was
wont to bathe him self in the river fill within a pytte / where he was eight
days / And his mother which was charitable to god and to saint Elysabeth had
therefore great dolor and sorrow / It befelle that at the last day of eight /
she dremed that her sone was in a pytte full of water / And that saint
Elysabeth kept him there on live / and told her / by cause that ye have ever
nourysshed and sustained the orphans and faderles / our lord will not / that
your sone deye ne perysshe in this pytte / And therefore make ye ready to have
him out / And then the mother awoke and made her sone to be had out of the
pytte / and fond him of fair color alive / And the child recounted to his
mother / how a fair lady had ever kept him / And had said to him It is gods
will that thou be saved for the charity and myserycorde of thy mother which
with good will had sustained the orphans and them nourysshed /

Therefore here is a good ensample how men ought to nourysshe the orphans and
the small children that have mystier or need for it is great alms and great
charity / and that much pleseth god and to this is showed to us example of
many other bestes also / that when men have slain the mother / and that the
faons ben lost without noreture / another be comes and nouryssheth them
unto the time that they may purueye them self

time gretter than it is / Capitulo / lxxxxvij
aNother ensample I shall reherce unto you upon this faytte / It befelle that
in the Town of Iherico was a woman which was named Raab / and the which was
blamed / but charytable she was / wherefore it befelle / that certain good men
which were come there for to preche to the people of that town euylle and
cruel there duellyng / wherefore they left and went and hyded them in the
said woman's hows / She casted over them beds and fardels of lynen clo^^ In so
much that the people could not find them / for they would have put them to
death / And at night the said woman had them out of her hows with a cord out
of a wyndowe / and saved them / wherefore it befell that she therefore was well
guerd^ned after the deserte / For the town was soon after take / and all the
men and wom^n put to death sauf this Raab / and her meyny / which god would
have saved / by cause she had saved his mynystres and sergeans / And therefore
says the holy Euangely / where god says / that the good and service that one
shall do to him or to his servant for the love of him / be shall render it a
C double / wherefore I would ye wist thexample of saint Anastasye / which was
put in prison / But god made her to be delyuerd out / And made her to wete /
that hit was / by cause that she sustained of her own good the prisoners
which were in the prysons and chartres where as she wist that any were put
in wrongly and by envy or for sum debte / And she gaf so much of her good
that she had them out / And therefore god guerdoned her to double /

And also the sweet Ihesu Christ said in theuangely / that at the day of his
great Judgment / he shall have mercy on them / which shall have vysyted and
comforted them / that were emprysoned / and the seek and also the pour wymmen
that lay pourely in their childbedde / For at that ferdful and dredefull day
god shall thereof ask a reckoning / and needs men must render him reason
thereof / And well I wene / that many one have be repreued thereof / which shall
be in great charge and pain to give a good ansuere /

And therefore my fair daughters / think now on hit whiles ye live / as did
saint Arragone which was queen of France / and which comforted and vysyted
the pour enchartered and emprysoned / and nourysshed the orphans / and
vysyted them that were seek / And by cause she might not entende to hit / as
often as she would for doubt to disobeye her lord she left her lord and all
the worship and vain glory of the world and the worldly Joy / and ran to
hyde her secretly fro paris unto Poytyers / And there she rendryd her self in
to thabbeye / and bycame a Nonne / and left the world / to the end she might
the better serve god without dread of any man / wherefore afterward god showed
for her sake a miracle / For a tree which stood in the mids of their
cloystre / the which was al dry / god made him to bycome and wexe fair and
grene And sprange out of hit new branches and leaves ageynste the course of
nature / But no thing is Impossible to god / And many other great miracles he
did for the love of her And therefore is here a good ensample to be charytable /
as above ye have herd of these two holy ladies / and of this good lady Raab /
as they did / and how at the last god gwerdoned and rewarded them for their
good seruyse /

How he that will pray god must do abstynence / ca / lxxxviij
aNother ensample shall be reherced to you of the Fader and mother of Sampson /
which were holy folk in their marriage / but they might have no Children / and
yet many clamours and orysons they had therefore made unto god / This good
lady was then upon a day at a church / which at that time was called temple
/ And as she was there weeping and prayenge god / god took pity on her / and
sent unto her an Angel / which told her / that she should have a sone that
should be the strongest man that ever was / and that by his strength the law
shol^d be enhaunced / The good lady came soon to her lord / and told him this
tydynge / Her lord then kneled / and prayed god / that he would show to him /
this thing by his angel / And then god sent to them his aungel / which
said unto them that they should fast and do abstynence / and also that they
should keep this child fro much mete and drink / And yet said the aungel / For
ouermoche ^tynge and drynkyng fyghten against the body and against the soul /
And when thus he had said to them / he departed fro them / They ^obeyed the
commandment of the Aungel / and fasted and made abstynence / And soon after
they had a chil^de / which when he was full grown he fought against the
paynyms and kept and mayntened the law of god ayens^ them / of whom he made
great occisyons and many great merueylles as god sustained and helped him / For
he allone discomfyted and overcame three thousand persons / Therefore ye have
here good ensample / how ye shall fast and do abstynence if ye will require
of god any thing / For confession and fasting done the request to be granted
of god / as the Aungel told unto them / And yet after he said to them / that
they should keep their sone fro ouermoche mete / and specially of drynk Then
sith the holy Aungel of god which al thing knows defended to them this two
vices / Hit is then good to every man and woman to keep them there fro. For by
this sin of glotonye men fall in all the other six dedely sins / as ye
shall more plainly know in the book of your brethren / where as it is
reherced / how an heremyte chose his sin of glotonye / and made it / in so
much he bycame drunk / And soon after by this sin he fylle and made all
the seven /

And nevertheless he had supposed to have chosen the most best of them all /
Whereof I shall tell you what Salamon thereof seyth in the book of
thenseygnements / first he says yt wyn taken as they did cut it / they saw
a white down / that issued out of hit / wherefore some of them by this ensample
were conuertyd to the feythe of god / And therefore after this ensample it is
good to put his children to scole when they be young / and make them to learn
the books of sapyence / that is to say the books of good techynge and
enseygnementes / where as men see the sauement of both the body and soul /
And not put them to learn in the books of the fallaces and vanytres of the
world / For better thing is and more noble to here speak of the good
enseygnementes and techynges that may prouffyte both to the body and soul /
than read and study the fables / and lesynges / whereof no good ne prouffyte
may come And by cause sum folk sayen that they would not / that their wives
ne also their daughters wist any thing of clergy ne of writing / therefore I
say answering to them / that as for writing it is no force / if a woman can
naught of hit but as for redynge I say that good and prouffytable is to al
wy^en / For a woman that can read may better know the peryls of the soul and
her sauement / than she that can nout of it / for it has be preued

her lord / And for the love of him she bare honor and loved his friends / and
made to them better chere than she did to her own friends / whereof hit befelle
/ that after that her lord was deed / his sone which he had of another wife /
would leave to her nothing / neither land ne meuable good / but would have al for
him self / by cause he thought / she was of far country and far fro her
friends / but the parents and friends of her lord that loved her much for her
great bounte / and for the great service that she had done to them whiles that
her lord was a live / did help her against their friends and parents / In so
much that they made her to have all that of right apperteyned to her / And so
this good lady saved her good through the friendship and good company that she
had done the friends and parents of her lord / And therefore is here good
ensample how all good wymmen ought to serve and bear worship to the friends
and parents of their lords / For gretter semblaunt of love may they not
show unto them / and all good may thereof come to her / as did to the good
lady Ruthe the which by cause she had loved and worshipped the parents and

king dauyd wherefore he would have had him to be destroyed and put to death /
but the good lady which was sage and wise went toward the king and so much
humbled her self / that by her sweet and fair words she made the pees of her
lord / Of many other peryls wherein he fylle and put him self through his false
tongue / she saved him also / And thus this good lady amended ever his folly /
whereof she may be well preysed / Therefore ye have here good ensample / how every
good woman must suffer of her lord and ought to answer for him over al / al be
he never so yrous ne cruel to her and save and keep him fro all peryls / I
would ye wist thexample of a good lady wife unto a Senator of Rome / as it is
contained in the cronykles of the Romans / This Senator was Ialous of his wife
without any cause and was euylle and cruel to her / Hit befelle / that he
accused one of treason / the which anon casted his gage of bataylle unto him
saying that wrongly he accused him / The day came that they should Iouste that
one against the other The Senator was aferd and durst not come / and sent word
to the Senate how he was seek / and that he should send one to Iouste for him /
but he could none find / Wherefore the valiant lady his wife that saw the
cowardnesse of her lord and the shame coming to him went and armed her self /
and came to the field / And by cause god saw her bounte and that she did her
deuoyr / he gaf her force and strength in so much / that she obtained the
vyctory / And when the Ioustynge was fynysshed / the emperor would know who
was the champyon of the Senator / wherefore the good ladies helm was unlocked /
and so she was known / wherefore the emperor and all they of the town bare
unto her fro thens forthon gretter honor than they were wont to do / And
therefore is here good ensample how every good woman must humbly suffer of her
lord that which she may not amend / For she that more suffers of her lord
without making thereof no resemblaunt receives thereof more worship x times /
than she that has no cause to suffer of him / or that will not suffer nothing
of him As Salamon says which much well spoke of wymmen / preysyng the one and
blaming the other

would have him to be slain but this good lady gate him his pees / For so many
good reasons she showed to her lord that he granted his grace and pardon / and
yet she was not his mother / but only wife of his fader / but she kept her lord
in love and his child^^n also / as a good lady that she was / And so ought to
do every good woman / For gretter semblaunt of love she may not show to her
lord / than to love his children which ben gotten of other wymm^n / And so
doing she worshippeth her self / And at last may come thereof but good to her
/ as did to this good lady / For when the king was deed / sum would have
taken her right fro her / but Absalon would not suffer hit / And said before
them all / how be it / that she be not my mother / yet ever she loved me / and
many time she has Impetred my pees toward the king my fader / wherefore I
shall not suffer that she any thing lose of her right / And therefore / here

had of him good counceylle of the which well it happed to her / Therefore ye
ought to take here good ensample / For every good lady ought to ch^se a good
and true man and also wise of her lygnage or else of other / and hold and keep
him in love and friendship / of whom she may take counceylle of that she has
to do / And if she fall in pl^e or in any contempt the good and wise man
shall amodere hit And shall make her to have her right without great costs
and expenses / And ever thereof comes sum good / As did to the good queen Sa
ba that fro so far came to have counceylle of the king Salamon / Yet would I
ye wist thexample of an Emperor of Rome / This emperor was seek and lay in
the bed of death / Every one of the lords and Senators for to please him
said to him that he should soon be hole if he could swette / But any friend that
he had spoke to him noothyng of the prouffyte and salvation of his soul /
There was there with him one his chamberlayne which he had nourysshed and
brought up of his yongthe / This chamberlayne saw well / that his lord couthe
not escape fro death / And how all they that were there said naught but for to
please him / wherefore he came to him and said / Sire how feel you your heart /
And the emperor ansuerd to him / Sore and feeble is my heart Then began the
chamberlayn to say much humbly / Sire god has given to you in this world
all worship and honor And also great quantite of worldly goods / wherefore ye
must thank him / and ye shall do well / And of such goods as god has sent
to you ye must ordeyne and depart to the pour folk a part of them / In
such wise that he have no cause to repreue you thereof / when the emperor had
herd him / He was well pleased with him that he had so said / and said two
words / More worth is the friend / which prycketh than the flaterynge friend
which enoynteth / Thus he spak / by cause that his other friends had spoken to
him of bodyly health / only for to please him / but the same spoke to him of
the salvation of his soul / for who that loves the body of very love ought in
especial to love the soul / And none ought to cele or hyde nothing fro his
friend / if it be his prouffyte and honor / And for love ne for hate of any
body / he ought not to counceylle him / but trewely after his power as a good
and true friend should do and not flatere him ne make the placebo / As did the
friends of the emperor which knew well / that he could not escape fro death /
and durst not say ne show unto him the prouffyte of his soul / the which
his true friend and pouer chamberlayne put in the way of salvation / For
the emperor byleuyd him and gaf and departed largely of his goods to the pour
for the love of god

time a prophet which was named Helyseus / This good lady had great devotion
toward this holy man and pro^hete / and prayed him to come and be herberowed
with her lord in her hows / They did anon make a chamber ready for him there
as the said holy prophet wered the hair and made his prayers and had his
afflyctions solytayrly and secretly / This good lady then might have no
children of her lord / whereof she made her complaynt to the prophet / but this
holy man at her request prayed god so long / that they had a sone
merueyllously fair which lived well xv year and deyde in the chamber of this
holy prophet / And when this good lady saw her sone deed / she was fulle of
sorrow / and went so far about the country that she fond and met with
the foresaid Helyseus / And when she had found him she had him to the chamber
/ and showed to him the child which was deed / saying to him in this manner /
Ha a holy prophet and good man this is the child which god sent me through
your prayer / the which was al my joy and my sustenaunce / I pray you that to
him ye will make your prayer and oryson that it please him to restore him his
life again / or else to take me with him / For I will not abide after him /
Helyseus then which had pity of the woman / prayed god for the child / and
god gaf him his life again and lived long time after that / and was an holy
man / by the which ensample / my fair daughters ye may see and know / how
good hit is to be known and aqueynted with holy men / As this good lady was /
which might have no children / but at the prayer of the holy man Helyseus / of

and knew well a man that did kiss her both day and night when that he would
/ And then I called her a side / and told her / that it was but folly to take
hed^ to the words of a fool and to answer and speak with him / The words
were foul and dishonest / and herd of many one / wherefore she was diffamed /
And by her brawlyng she did do know to many one that which they wist ne knew
not / She resembled not to the wise Sarra / which made no great ansuere to the
words of her godsep / For otherwhyle one put him self fro his good right by
his own words in to great wrong / And also dishonest thing is to any
gentylle woman to braule with any man / wherefore I shall tell you thexample of
the propriete of certain beestes / Look and behold these great dogs that men
call mastyns / they shall bark and show their tethe / but a gentylle dog
shall not do so / And also in like wise should be of the gentylle men and
wymmen / wherefore I shall reherce to you thexample of the emperor of
Constantynople / which was a man much felon and cruel / but never he chydde
to no body / It byfell ones that he found his two daughters chiding and
brawling to gyder / wherefore he would beat them / but the queen went between
him and them / And then said the emperor that none gentle heart should never
chyde ne say any vylony / For by the courage and heart ben the gentylmen known
fro the other / For he is a chorle and a vylayne that of his mouth says any
vylonye / And therefore they that have pacyence and say no vylonye shown their
gentle courage and noblesse / And for certain oftyme hit befelle that one
foul word spoken engenders other such words / which afterward bears shame
and dishonor / And therefore my fair daughters take ye here good ensample /
For the fool which is of high courage shall say much euylle and things
that never were thout for to avenge his great ire / And also ought well every
good woman to keep her self that she nothing ansuere to her lord before the
folk for many causes / For in holding her pees she may have and receive but
great worship / And if she answer him she shall have the euylle will of her
husbond / whereof no goood may come to her / but great shame and dishonor

which would rather suffer death / than to be falls to the law / For she doubted
more the perdycion or loss of her soul and the perdurable or everlasting
death / than she did the pouere life of this world / And thus by cause of her

she saw her point / Then went she / and told it to him by so fair and
attemperate langage that in no wise he might never be wroth / She ever c^ueyted
the pees and love of her lord And also ought to do every good woman / This
holy lady loved and dradde god / and bare feythe to her lord / and therefore god

that loves god / and holds her clenely god rewards her on live / And after
her death he guerdonne^h and rewards her with / C / double mo / As he did to

How men ^ught bewaylle and weep for his sins and misdeeds Capitulo lxxxxix
aNother Ensample I shall tell you of Mary Magdalene / which did wasshe and
spurge awey her sins and misdeeds by the water of her eyes / as she washed
the feet of our lord Ihesu Christ / and wyped them with her here / She wept
for her sins for the love of god and dread of her mysdede / And thus at
thexample of her we ought to do as she did / For we ought to weep for our
sins and misdeeds. and have pity and be shameful of that that we have done
and humbly goo to Confession / and there to the preeste we ought to tell our
sins as we have done them without hydyng or coueryng nothing thereof / for the
boldness that men undertake to say their mysdede and sin also the shame that
me^ have to tell them / is to them a great part of their indulge^ces and god
which sees the hu^ylyte and the repentance moves him self to pity and
e^largyssheth his misericorde / as he did to Mary Magdalene to whom he
pardonned her sins and misdeeds for the great contricion and repenta^nce that
she had / Another reason is whereof the holy magdalene ought to be preysed It is
by cause that she loved and wonderly ^rad god / And for certain the great
miracle that she saw which god made and that he had raised her own brother /
the which had told her tidings of the other world / and the pains of hell
And that she saw well / that she must dye and be punysshed there for her sins
and misdeeds / made her al ferdfull and sore abashed / And therefore she was
thyrtty year and more in a deserte making there her penance sorowynge and sore
weeping for her sins and misdeeds / And when she had been there long time
fasting and without mete / our lord beheld her / and had on her pity / and
sent her every day the bread of heaven / whereof she was rassasyed and fylde
unto her end that god took her / And therefore is here good ensample how good
is to weep for his sins / and often to confess him self / and to fas^ and
make abstynences and also to love and dread god / as did this holy and good
Magdaleyne / that so much loved god / that she wept for her sins upon his
feet / And after fasted and suffered so much euylle and meschyef in the
buscage and deserts / where as god comforted her by his angels / which every
day did bring to her the bread of heaven / And in such wise shall god do to
all good wymmen and to all them / which with a contryte and good heart
shall weep for their sins / and that shall love god and do abstynences /
as he did to this good woman /

Capitulo C
aFter this ensample I shall tell you another of ij good wymen wives of two
paynyms / The onewas wife to the seneschall of Herod / This go^d woman served
our lord at ye time that he preched and administered and made his mete and
drink the best wise they couthe / Here i^ good ensample how every good woman /
al be it so that she have never so peruers and euylle husbond / yet this
notwithstondyng she ne ought to leave the seruyse of god and be obeysshynge to
him / or else at lest she ought to be more ^umble and devout for to Impetre
and get the grace of god for her and for her husbond / For the good that she
does appeaseth the ire of god / and is cause of the sauement of their
temporal richesse and goods / For the good that she does suporteth the
euylle and misdeeds of her husbond / as it is reherced in the life of the
Ancient faders / where as he spek^th of an euylle man and a tyrant / the
which was three t^mes saved fro euylle death for goodness and bounte of his wife
/ Wherefore hit befelle when she was deed and that he had no body more that
prayed for him / he was for his great sins and misdeeds brought in to a
shameful death by the king of that land / And therefore it is good and necessary
to an evil man to have a good wife and of holy life / And the more that the good
wife knows her husbond more felon and cruel / and great synuar / the more she
ought to make gretter abstynences and good deeds for the love of god / And if
the one suffer not the other / that is to understand / if the good did suffer
and supported not the euylle / all^ should go to perdicion / And yet I say that
the obeyssaunce and dread of god was stablysshed before marriage / For men ought
first obey to the creator / which has made them to his blessed form and
semblaunce and that may give them grace to be saved / And also the law
commands that men ought not to obey to the body / tylle that they have
purueyed first for the prouffyte of the soul / which is perdurable / whereupon
says the gloss that all good and dew seruyse of the body is to the sauement
of the soul / For the good of the soul has none like hit / And therefore it is
good to dress and meue his lord to do sum good / And after his pour to
keep him fro euylle deed / And thus ought to do every good woman /

How it is good to herberowe and receive in his hows the gentylle wymmen that
were of good renommee / she enhaunced and married them / She maade to seche and

naught to pay / And as men say god showed and made oftyme miracle for her
sake / For when men took her her book and her paternoster / they stood
before her allone by them self in the aye^ And also many other tokens and
signs were seen / which for her love god did show / And therefore here ought
every good woman to take good ensample and have pity one of other / and think
how god gives the goods to be thereof thanked and known / and to help and
have pity on the pour / Here I leave the tale of these good ladies and of this
matere But soon I shall com^ to hit again / and shall speak of another

mysprysed and mysdone / And if one be smeton of his neighbor / or of his
brother christian upon one cheke / he ought to l^ye forth the other for to
receive on it as much / For taking vengeance is none merit / but is
contrary to ^he sowl^ / And yet says our lord / that if one have any hate or
wrath with any other / he ought to goo and ask him mercy to fore he make or
do his oryson / offrynge or prayer / that it may be of any valewe and
playsaunt to god / For of no mane^ of man ne woman / which in the sin of ire
/ god receives not their offrynge / how great that it be / For as god that
maad the pater noster which says that god should pardonne to them / as they
pardonned to other / therefore we ought to pardonne each one to other / And thus
they that been ever in wrath / and hate / if they say the pater noster / their
prayer is more against them / than with them / And upon this / I shall tell
you an ensample of a great Burgeyse / as I herd say at a p^edycacion or
prechynge / This Burgeyse was much rich / charytable / and much preysed /
and had on her many signs and tokens to be a good c^ysten / It befelle that
she was brought thorugh a great sekenes to the bed of death / there came to her
/ her curate or parson which was a holy man and true / He herd her in
confession / And as he came to speak to her of the sin of ire / saying to
her that she must pardonne to all them that had mysprysed or mysdone unto her
/ And when she herd of that article / she ansuerd that a woman which was
her neighbor had so much mesprysed and mysdone unto her / that she might
never pardonne ne forgive her with her good will / Then the holy man began to
put for^he and show unto her by fair words and ensa^ples / how Ihesu Christ
forgaaf and pardonned his death / Also he reherced to her thexample of a
knights sone / whose fader had be slain / This knights sone came to an
heremyte and confessyd him / And as he came to the sin of ire / he said /
that he might never pardon^e ne Forgive to him that had slain his fader / And
the holy heremyte showed him how god forgaf his death / and many other
ensamples he did show unto him / And so much he said that by his sweet and
fair words / the child pardonned and forgaf his faders death with good will /
In such wise that when the child came to knele before the crucyfyxe / he
enclyned his heed toward him / And a voys was herd / which said / by cause
that thou have pardonned humbly for the love of me / I pardonne and forgive to
the al thy sins and misdeeds / and thou shall have grace to come to me in to
the celestyal joy / This parson or curate then showed and told this ensample
with many other to the said Burgeis / But for none ensample ne for no thing
that he couthe say or do / she would never forgive her euylle will / but in
that estate she deyde / whereof hit befelle that at night a vysyon came to the
said curate or parson / by the which vysion he saw how the in such point and
estate as I was when I herd you I am come to see you / therefore please it you
to pardonne me for the great Joy which I have of your coming maade me to
do hit / The knight then beheld and saw the manner of his nyece / whereof he
was full glad / and loved and preysed her much more than his other nyece / He
gaf her the two gowns which he had bought for her and for her suster / And
thus she that came gladly in thestate wherynne she was to welcome her uncle /
she wanne both gowns / and she which tarried for to make her ioly and gay
lost her part of them / She then that forthwith came to welcome her uncle as
she had brought him in her chamber / she went and propyrly arrayed her self /
And then said to him / My lord and mine uncle / I have arrayed and coynted me
for to serve you more honestly / And thus she gate the love of her uncle / and
the other lost it / Here is good ensample / how men ought to come ioyously in
thestate where one is in to welcome his friends which be come to see him / And
if ye wist thexample of a baronnesse or wife of a baron which Was a good lady /
and which would in no manner were ne do on every day her best gowns /
wherefore her servants said to her / Madame why go ye not better arrayed and
more coynted than ye do / And she answered to them / if every day I went in my
best rayments and held me coynte and Ioly / how should I do on the high
feestes and holidays / And also as the lords my parents shall come to see
me / For then as I should array me the best wise I couthe / yet men should say
that all the day before I was fayrer and better besene / whereof no thank I
should have of them which were come to see me / And therefore I preyse her
nothing that can not amend her self in time and place as need is / For a

Of the good knight which fought against the false knight for the pity of a

I Would ye wist thexample of a knight which fought for a maid / There was at
the Court of a great lord a falls knight which required and prayed a maid of
folyssh love / but she would naught do for him for yeste ne for promise / but
would keep her body clenely / And when the knight saw this / he said that she
should repent her / He took an Appel / and poysonned it / and few days after
that he took the appel to her for to give it to the young sone of her lord /
She took the appel / and gaf it to the child / And soon after that he had eten
it he deyde / wherefore this maid was take and shortly to say ready for to be
burnt / She wept and complained her self to god saying that she had no culpe
of this deed / but that the false knight which took her thapple was thereof
gylty and none other / And he deffended it against her / and said he was ready
to preue the contrary against any knight in champ of battle / But she couthe
find none that for her would fight against him / by cause he was so strong and
so much doubted in arms / wherefore it befelle that our lord god which
forgeteth not the clamor and prayer of the true and Just had pity of her /
And as it pleased him a good knight which had to name patrydes that was free
and pyteous / as men were about for to have cast the maid in to the fire / and
beheld the maid which wept sore and made great sorrow / He had pity of her /
and demanded of her the truth of the fayt And fro the begynyynge unto the
end she told him how hit was / And also the most part of them that were there
present wytnessyd as she said / Then the good knight meued of pity casted
his gage against this false knight / The bataylle was between them hard and
cruel to see in so much that a^ the last this false knight was disconfyted and
openly did show his treason / And thus was the maid saved / But the good
knight patryde received at that sorrow / v / mortal wou^des / wherefore as his
arms were of he sent his sher^e which was broken in five places to the said
maid which kept hit all her life / and every day she prayed for the knight
that such dolor had suffered for her / And thus for pity and Fraunchyse fought
the gentle knight / and received / v / mortalle wounds As the sweet Ihesu
Christ did which faught for the pity of that they should have none / by cause
they were come to late / wherefore I doubt after the purpos of this ensample /

that been not garnysshed of that which is apperteynynge to their sauement /
that is to wete to do good and holy operacions / and have the grace of god /

that is to say that they have made good and holy operacions and have watched
for to abide the hour of their death / and have not be slepynge in sin /

Of the glorious and blessed vyrgyne Marye Capitulo Cvij
aFter this I shall speak of one vyrgyne which has no pere / It is of the
holy and blessed vyrgyne Marye mother to the savior of all the world / This
blessed vyrgyne is of so high exemplary that none may write the good / the
bounte and the hyghenesse wherein her sweet and blessed sone enhaunceth her day
by day / This sweet vyrgyne worshipped and drad her sone more than ever did
any other mother his / by cause she knew well / fro whens he came / She was
chamberere and Temple of God where as the wedding of the deyte and of the
humylyte was maade / the which humanyte brought the life and sauement of all
the world / God would that she should take to her spouse the holy man Joseph /
which was a good old man and true / For god would be borne under the shadow
of marriage for to obey to the law and for to eschew the euylle talking of
the world / And also for to give her company and govern and led her in to
Egypt / Whereof it befelle / when Joseph perceived and saw her great with
child / he would leave her / and told her / how he well wyste and knew / that hit
was not of him / but that same night our lord sent him vysybly his angel /
which said unto him / that he should not be desmayed ne abashed / And that she
was great with the holy ghost for the sauemente of all the world / Joseph
had then thereof great Joy / and payned him self to bear unto her worship
and honor / more than he did before / For he wist well by the saying and
writing of the pro^hetes that the sone of god should be borne of a vyrgyn /
which should have to name Marye / wherefore he thanked God much humbly of the
great grace that he had done to him / in gyuyng to him the keeping and
governance of his sweet and blessed mother / And also the good mother and
vyrgyne bare to him honor and reverence / whereof in the holy scripture she is
much preysed / Also she is much preysed of that the Angel found her alone
within the Temple knelynge saying her prayers and orysons / And thus ought
every good woman to be in devotion and in the seruyse of god /

And yet the holy scripture preyseth her by cause she dradde and was aferd as
the Aungel salewed her / Of whom she demanded how it might be that she should
conceive a child that had never known man / and thau^gel ansuerd her and
said to her yt she should have no fere and that she should not be merueylled /
for she should be replenysshed with the holy ghost and that nothing was
inpossyble as to god / that was to say that god might do all thing after his
will and playsyre / And that her Cosyn saint Elyzabeth was great with child /
and had as then born her fruit the space of six months / the which was
barayne and was out of the age to bear any children / And then as the Aungel
had thus said to her / she assewred her self / and said in this manner / Here
is the auncylle or chambrere of god Be done to me after thy words / She would
first know how it might be / But thus did not Eve / she did believe to lytely /
As this day done many simple wymmen which lyghtely believe the fools /
wherefore afterward they be brought to do folly / They enquere not ne behold
not the end to the which they shall come / as did the glorious and blessed
vyrgyn Marye / which inquired of the Aungel the end of the faytte or deed /
the which he did announce to her /

Thus then ought the good wymmen to do / as men speaks to them of yongthe /
or of any other thing / whereof dyshonoure and blame may come to them

How every good woman ought to be meke and humble at thexemplary of the blessed
vyrgyne Mary / Capitulo Cxviij
aLso the holy writing preyseth her for her greet humylyte / For as the
Aungel told her that she should be the mother of the sone of God / of whom the
regne should have none end / She took no pride therefore within he r self / but
said that she was his chamberere or seruaunt^ And that hit should be done after
his playsyre / This word was right agreeable unto god / in so much that he
came down fro heaven / and daygned to take humanyte / and the form of a child
within her womb virgynal / Therefore is here good Ensample / how every good
woman ought to humble her self toward god / toward her lord and toward the
world / For god said / who that shall mo re humble him self / and shall keep
him self mekely / the more shall he be ones enhaunced and worshipped / And for
certain god and his Angels louen better humylyte than any other virtue / For
humylyte fight against pride / which god hates more than any other sin /
And thorugh the which the Angels fell in to hell / And therefore ought every
noble woman to humble her self / and be curtoys to the least as to the most
taking exemplary to our blessed lady mother and vyrgyne Mary / which named her
self chamberere of god / Also she is preysed of the holy scripture for her good
kind and nature of her curtosye when she went and vysyted her cosyn saint
Elysabeth / which would serve her And the child of Elysabeth / that was saint
Johan baptist maade then Joy within his moders belly / In so much yt by the
grace of the holy ghost / saint Elysabeth cried and said / that blessid should
be the fruit of her womb and that she was blessed above al wymmen / and that
hit was not reason that the mother of god should come to see and vysyte so pour a
woman as she was / And than both Cosyns humbled them self one toward the other
/ wherefore good exemplary is here / how that parents and Friends ought to see
and vysyte each other in their childbedde / and in their disease and sickness
/ And humble them self the one against the other / as did these two holy and
blessed ladies / as ye have herd / and not say as do some which of their
proud and folysshe heart say thus I am the more noble / the more gentylle /
either the more high maystresse: And therefore I ought to go before that other /
Ha a god how little they think to the curtosye and humylyte of these two holy
ladies / And also to that / that god says in his euangely / as ye have herd /
that the most humble shall be the most hyghely enhaunced / Allas how this
folyssh envy that they have to be first and before other and the preysynge of
them self / shall to them be dear sold / whereof the good queen Hester speaks
and says right well / saying that in as much as a woman is of gretter lygnage
or gretter maystresse / the more ought she to be humble and debonayr / And the
more that she bears her self curtoysly / the more she receives worship and
praysynge of other folk / for the small folk holds them to be worshipped
when the great make to them any chere and speak fair to them / wherefore the
great be preysed of them in every place / And therefore no better virtue may be
in a woman / than the virtue of humylyte / and be curtoys both to great and
small / And goo and vysyte the pour / their Friends and parents / as did the
queen of heaven which went and vysyted her Cosyn / and how they humbled them
self one toward the other /

How every good woman ought to be pyteous at the exemplary of the blessed
vyrgyne Marye / Capitulo / Cix
aLso the holy scripture preyseth her / in that she went in to galylee to the
wedding / and had pity of that the wyn lacked there / And in complaynyng her
self of that the wyn wanted there / required her sone that he would give
remedy to it / The sweet Ihesu Criste had pity of his mother / And therefore is
here good ensample / how every good woman ought to have pity of her parents
and pour neybours and to help and socoure them of that she may / For hit is
great charity and fredome coming of kind / Also the sweet vyrgyne Marye had
and suffered dolor for her sone / which was gone to dyspute ageynste the
maystres of the law / For she wend that he was ascended and gone in to heaven /
She sought him al about / and so much she did / that she found him / to whom
she said / Fair sone your parents and I have be in great fere for you / For
we wend to have lost you / And he ansuerd that his parents were tho that did
the commandments of god his fader / The Jews then and the masters of the
law were wo^derly abashed of the great wit that they found in him which was
of so little age / After this dolor then yt she had wenyng her self to have
lost her sone she had another rit great sorrow / for as she offered him in to
the temple / saint Symeon received him which before desired much to see him /
and had praid to god long time before that he might not deye unto the time
that he first had seen the sone of god with his eyes / Then thorugh the grace
of god he knew him / and said with a high voys / Here is the light and the
sauement of the world / And said to his mother that one time should come / that
to her should seem that a suerde should tresperce her soul and her heart / that
is to wete / that she should see him suffer great and dolorouse passion / And
therefore is here good ensample to every good lady and to every good woman how
they may not be desmayed ne esmerueyll^d as they suffer any mysease / seeing
that the queen of heaven suffered in this world so much pain and dolor /
Then ought we well to suffer and have pacyence we that be pour synnars / and
that deseruen more after our merit / to receive pain and evil than good /
And that by reason ought not to be spared in berynge dolours and trybulacions /
seeing that god spared not his mother /

Cecylle and many other holy ladies / which were so charitable that they gaf to

was not far thens / and gaf to her a good furred gown / And whiles she was
about this charytable deed / the priest that said the mass couthe speak never
a word unto the time that she was come to the Church again / And as soon as
she was come again he spoke as he did to fore / And saw afterward in a vysion
the cause why he had lost his speech / and hou god preyseth before his a^gels
ye gift given of the good lady to him / Here is good ensample for every good
woman to be charytable and not to suffer her pour neighbors to be shaking
for cold and hongre / ne to have any mysease / but to help them as far / as
their power may retche / Now have I told you of the blessed and holy vyrgyne
Marye / to the which none may be lykened ne compared / And little enough I
have spoken of her / but to long were the matere if I should speak of all her
deeds and fayttes / Therefore as now I shall leave of her / And shall speak of
the good wydowes ladies of Rome / the which when as they held them clenly in
their wydowhede they were worshipfully crowned in sign and token of chastyte /
But long thing were to reherce the bounte and charity of them / which were
before the coming of Ihesu Christ / as it is found and reherced in the bible
/ Also I have recounted to you of some good ladies which have been syn the new
testament / that is to wete syn god took his humanyte within the womb of the
blessed vyrgyne Marye / And in like wise as the holy scripture preyseth the
good ladies of that time / It is reason and right that we preyse some of this
present time wherein we be / Wherefore I shall tell you of every estate of them
one example or tweyne for to show example unto al other / For men ought not to
hyde the goodhede / ne also the worship of them / And none good lady ought not
to take desdayne of hit / but be glad to here tell and recounte the goodness
and worship of them

Of the queen Iohane of France / capitulo / Cxj
tHe good queen Jane of France which of late passed out of this world / and
the which was wise / of holy life / and much charytable / and also full of
devotion / held her estate so clenly and so noble by so good ordenau^ce / that
great thing were to reherce it / After by her shall we set the duchess of
orliau^ce which in her life suffered much / but she kept her ever clenly and
holily / but to long it were to recou^te of her good life and good condycions /
Also we may not forgete the good Countess of Roussyllon / the which she
being a wydowe kept and governed her sel^f so clenely / and so peasyble did
nourysshe her children / the which also kept good Justice and held her land
and people in pees Also I will tell you of a baronnesse which duellyd in our
Country the which was in wydowhede by the space of xxxv year / and was young
and fair when her lord deyde / and of many one she was required / But she
said in her secret / that for the love of her lord and of her children she
should never be wedded / And held her in her wydowhede clenly without any
reproach / whereof she ought to be preysed / And her name I shall declare unto
you / It was my lady of Vertus

Example of many good ladies of time present / Capitulo Cxii
aLso I shall tell you of the wife of a knight which was a wydowe / This lady
was young and fair / and of many men lords and knights she was desired and
required to marriage / but never she would be wedded / but nourysshed her
children right worshipfully / Wherefore she ought to be preysed / and yet more
she might be preysed during her lords life / For her lord was over little of
person crokbacked goglyed and vncurtoys / And she was fair and young / and a
gentylle woman borne / but the good lady loved and worshipped him / as any
woman can or may love any man / And dradde / and served him so mekely that many
man (...) wonder thereof / wherefore she may well be set in to the nombre of the
good wymmen / Now shall I tell you of a good woman / the wife of a simple man
/ This lady was good and fair / and of good lignage / and also young / and her
lord was old and ancient / and al turned in trance / for he pyssed and made
under him his syege / as a young child does / But nothwithsto^dyng all this the
good lady served him night and day right humbly and with good heart and more
curtoisly than should have done a chamberere or servant / Some came often to her
for to fetch her to the dau^ces and festes / but seldom she went thither / And
no plesaunce ne no thing might have hold her as time was for to do some
seruyse to her lord / And if one said to her / Madame ye should take your
sport / and play more often than ye do / And be other great peryls / And as
he has suffered pain and trauail enough / he is put and enhaunced in to great
honor / And great yeftes ben then given to him / and great wonder and
merueylle it is if the great worship and great renommee that men beren unto him
/ Like wise it is of the good lady and good woman / which in every place is
renommed in honor and worship / This is the good woman that payneth her self
to keep her body clean and her worship also / the which also set naught by
her yongthe ne of the delytes and folysshe plesaunces of this world / whereof
she might receive any blame / as I have said before of the knights / the
which take and suffer such point and trauaylle for to be put in to the
nombre of the other that been renommed of great worthynes and valyaunce / This
ought to do every good woman and every good lady / and think how thus doing
she geteth the love of god and of her lord / of their friends and of the world
And the sauement of her soul / whereof the world preyseth her and god also /
For he calls her the precious Margarite / It is a perle / which is white and
round bright and without macule or spotte / Here is a good ensample how god
preyseth the good lady in the euangely / and thus ought to do all folk / For
m^n ought to do and bear as much worship and honor to a good lady or
damoysell as to a good knight or squire / But as now this day the world is al
turned vpsodoune / For worship is not kept in her right regle / ne in her
right estate / as hit was wont to be / Now I will tell you how on a time I
herd say to my lord my fader and to many other good knights / how in their
time men worshipped and bare great reverence to the good women / And how they
which were worthy to be blamed / were refused and separed out of the felauship
of the other / And yet it is not past forty year that this customme was as
they said / And at that time a woman reproved of blame had not be so hardy to
put her self in the Row or company of them that were renommed / Wherefore I
shall tell you of two good knights of that time / the one was named My lord
Raoul / de lyege / and the other had to name Geffroy / and were both brethren
/ and good knytes in arms / for ever they vyaged and never rested tylle they
came in place where they might essaye and preue the strength of their bodies
for to get worship and good renomme / And so much they did by their valyaunce
/ that at the last they were renommed over al / as charny and bouchykault were
in their time / And therefore they were byleuyd and herd before all other as
knights auctorysed and renommed

How thauncyent were wont to learn the young / Capitulo Cxv
^Herfore hit became that if they saw a young man of age make any thing that
did against his honor they showed him his fawte before the folk / And therefore
the young men dradde them much / For then as I herd say to my lord my fader
/ how a young man came to a feste where were many lords ladies and damoysels /
and ^rrayed as they would have set them to dinner / and had on hem a coo^e
hardye after the manner of almayne / He came and salewed the lords and ladies /
And when he had done to them reverence / the foresaid Sire Geffroy called him
before him / and demanded him where his vyell or clauycordes were / and that
he should make his craft / And the young man ansuerd / Sire I can not meddle
therewith / Ha a said the knight / I can not believe it / For ye be contrefaytted
and clothed like a mynystrell / Nevertheless I know well your auncestrye and
the good and true men of the tower / of the which ye be come of / But in good
faith I saw never none of your lygnage / that wol^de have contrefayted him ne
also be clothed of such gown as ye be / And then he ansuerd to the knight
ageyn Sith that my clothing seems to you lothely and dishoneste hit shall be
amended / Then he called to him a mynystrell and gaf him his gown / and took
another / and came again to the halle / And when the good and ancient knight
saw him he said / trewely this young man forueyeth not / For he byleueth the
counceylle of his older / And every young man and young wymmen which believe
the counceylle of thauncyent and good folk may not faylle to come to honor
and worship / And therefore is here a good ensample / how none ought to believe /
and not to have shame ne vergoyne of the techynge of the wise men and more
ancient than he is / For that which they say and techen they done it not but
for good / But the young men and wymmen that been at this day take to this no
head / but have great despyte when they be repreued of their wyckednes and
folly / and wene to be more wise than the old and ancient folk / It is great
pity then of such vnknowlege / For every gentylle heart and of honest
living ought to have great Joy when he is repreued of his fawte and mysdede
/ and if he be wise and sage / he shall thank him / by whom he knows his
fawte / And in this is shown and perceived the free kind of the good young man
and young woman / For no chorlysshe nor vylayne heart shall never give thank ne
graces of it / Now have I told to you how thauncyent spoke and chastysed the
young men / And now I shall tell you how they gaf good ensamples to the good
ladies and damoysels that were at that time

How hit was wont to depart the blamed and dyffamed women fro the felauship
and company of the good and true / Capitulo Cxvj
IN tho days was the time of pees / and were holden great festes and reueyls /
and al manner of knights and ladies and damoysels gadred and assembled to gyder
where as they wist that any feste was kept and holden / And there they came
with great worship / and with them came the good knights of that time / but if
hit happed by sum adventure / that any lady or damoysell yt had evil name or
were blamed of her honor put her self / and went before another of good
reno^me / how be hit that she were more gentyl and more noble and more Rich /
yet notwithstondynge the good and ancient knights had no shame to come to
them before every one / ne to tell thus to them / lady or damoysel be not you
displesyd if this lady go before you / for how it be so that she be not so
noble ne so rich as ye be / nevertheless she is not blamed / and has good
Renommee / and is put among the nombre of the good wymmen / And thus it is not
said of you wherefore me displeases much / but worship and honor shall be
borne to them that be worthy / and have deserved it / And therefore be not you
meruaylled / Thus and in like wise spoke that time the good and ancient
knights and put them of good Renommee the first and formest / whereof they
thanked god that had give them grace to keep and hold them clenely / whereby
they were set before the other and worshipped over al / And the other took
them self by the nose casting their faces dounward / and received much shame
and vergoyne / And therefore was this a good ensample to al wymmen / For by the
great repreef and shame that they herd say and talk of the other / they
doubted and drad any thing / to do that was amys / of which they might be
blamed as the other were / But certainly now vppn this day men bear as great
worship to them that been blamed as to the good and true / whereof many one
takes euylle ensample / and say / I see that men bear as great honor to
them / which should be blamed and dyffamed / as they do to the honest and true
/ it is no force to do euylle / al thing passes forth awey / but nevertheless
it is euylle said / For in good feythe how be it that they wene to ^^^eyue
honor and worship of them that be with them / whan^e they be departed they
mock and scorn with them / saying one to other / Such one is full curtoys
of her body / such a man takes his disporte with her / And thus sum maken
good chere and beren honor before them / and behynd their backs they pulle
out their tongues in scornynge of them But the folysshe wymmen perceive them
not / but Ioyen them self in their folly / and wene that none know their fawte
and shame / Thus is the time changed otherwise than hit was wont to be /
wherefore hit is damage and great pity / For hit were best that of their fawte
and blame they were reproved before al as they were at that time / Yet more I
shall tell you / as I have herd reherced of many knights which saw and
knew the said Sire Geffroy de lyege / how that as he rode thorugh the Country
/ and as he aspyed and saw some place or manoyr / he demanded and asked the /
place / and if he understood by any manner that the lady of the manoyr or place
were blamed of her honor and worship / he should have gone out of his right
way / Rather than he had not gone to the yate of the same place / and make
there a faytte and put and set his signs ageynste the yate / And then rode
again in to his right way / And contrary to this deed / if hit happed to him
to pass before the place of a good and Renommed lady or damoyselle / al had he
never so great haste / he went to see her / And said to her my good Friend /
other my lady / or else damoysell / I pray to god that in this welthe and
honor he will ever hold and mayntene you in to the nombre of the good wymmen
/ For well ye ought to be preysed and worshipped / And thus by this manner and
way the good wymmen drad and held them more sure fro doing any thing / whereby
they might lose their worship and honor / wherefore I would that time were come
again / For as I wene many one should not be blamed and diffamed as they be now
/

How before this time men punysshed them that were diffamed Capitulo Cxvij
Wherefore if the wymmen recorded and thought the time past before the coming
of Christ / which lasted more than five thousand year / And how the badde and
euylle wymmen / specially they that were wedded were punysshed / as they
mysgyded them / For if it might be proved only by two men that they had had
company or carnal felauship with any other than to their lord / she was burnt
either stoned with stones / And for no gold ne silver she might be saved al
were she never so noble / after the law of god and of Moses / And yet I ne
know but few Reames this day sanf the Reame of France and of England / and
in the low or basse Almayne / but that men do Iustyse of them when the
truth and certaynte of the deed may be openly known / That is to wete in
Romayne / In Spain / In Aragon / and in many other Reames / In sum plares
men kytte of their throtes / And in sum they be heded before the people / And
in other places they be mewred or put between two walls / And therefore this
Example is good and prouffytable to every good woman / For how be hit that in
this Royamme Justice is not done of them as in other Reames / Nevertheless they
lose therefore their worship and their estate / the love of god and of their
lords and of their friends and world also / For they ben separed and put
out of the book of them that been good and true / as more plainly is reherced
in the book of the holy faders life / whereof the tale should be long to reherce
/ whereof I shall tell you a much fayr-example / the highest of all other
examples as hit is / which god told of his mouth / as tells the holy
scripture

How god compared the good woman to the precious Margaryte / Capitulo Cxviij
gOd preyseth the good woman / which is clean and pure / And says / how it is
a noble thing of a holy and good woman / And sith god of his own mouth
preyseth her so / by good reason the world and all the folk ought to love and
preyse her well / It is contained in the Euangely of the vyrgyns / how the
sweet Ihesu Christ preched and taught the people / and spoke upon the matere of
the good and clean wymmen where as he says / Vna Margarita preciosa comparauit
eam / I tell you said our lord / that a woman which is pure and clean out to
be compared to the preciouse Margaryte / This was merueyllously spoken / For a
Margaryte is a great perle and round bright and white and clean without any
spotte or tatche / This perle is named Margaryte preciouse / And did god show
the valor and worth of the woman / For she that is clean and without tatche
/ that is to say / she that is not wedded that keeps her vyrgynyte and
chastyte / And also she that is wedded which keeps and holds her self
clenely in the holy sacrament of marriage / and not suffers her self to be
shamed of her spouse / the which god has destyned and given to her / Also she
that keeps well and clenely her wydowhede / These be tho / as the gloss seyth /
of whom god spoke in his holy euuangely / These be lykened and compared as
said our lord to the precious margaryte which is ever bright and clean
without any macule or tatche / For as says the holy scripture nothing is so
agreeable to god and to his Angels as a good woman / and in a part god preyseth
more her than the man / And by reason she ought to have more merit / by cause
she is of lyghter courage than the man is / that is to say that the woman was
fourmed and made out of the man's body / And in so much that she is more feeble
than the man is / And if she resists ageynste the temptacions of the deuylle
/ of the world / and of the flesh / the more she is worthy to have gretter
merit than the man / And therefore god compares her to the precious margaryte /
which is bright and clean / Also says the gloss in another place / that as it
is a foul thing to spylle drops of ynke in to a dysshe full of milk / Right
so is of her that ought to be a good maid when she spylleth and gives her
maydenhede to another than to her spouse / And also is of her which is wedded
that of her falshede and foul lecherye breketh and spylleth her holy sacrament
of marriage and forswereth her feythe and her law toward God and the church /
and toward her lord also / Also she which ought to bear her self clenely in
her wydowhede and that does the contrary / This manner of wymmen be like the
black tatches that been upon the white milk and upon the white couerchyef /
they be like in no thing to the precious Margaryte For in the precious
margaryte is no manner of tatche / Allas a woman ought well to hate her self /
and to curse her evil life when she is put out of the nombre of the good and
true women / Then if they remembered well them self of three things / the
first is how they that be not yet wedded lose their marriage and their honor
and acquere the shame and hate of their parents and friends and of the world /
And how every one show them with the finger / Secondly / how they that been
wedded lose al worship and the love of god / and of their lords / of their
friends and of al other / for god lets them to have any welthe or cheuaunce
/ And to long were the foul and euylle talking which is said of them / to be
reherced / For sum shall do to them good chere before them / but behynd them
/ they shall hold their talking scornyng and mockyng them / And never after
they shall love their lord / For the devil shall make them as brennynge and
to have more delight in that dampnable sin of fornycacion / than in the deed
of marriage / For in the deed of marriage is no mortal sin / for it is an
operacion commanded of god / And therefore the deuylle has nothing to do of
hit / but in puterye and in sin mortalle or dedely he has great power / and
is there in his person to chauffe and meue the synnar to the false delight / as
the smyth / which puts the cole in the fornays / and then he blows and
kyndeleth hit / And so much wayteth the deuylle to serve them well in that
foul delight / and to keep them stylle therein / that at the last he caryeth and
bears with him their souls in to the deep pytte of hell / whereof he takes
as great Joy / and holds him thereof as well apayed / as does he that all the
day has chaced and at even he takes the best and has it with him / And in
like wise does the devil of al such men and wymmen as rayson is / For the
holy writing says / they that been chauffed and brennynge in the fire of
lecherye / shall be burnt in the fire of hell / And it is well reason as a
good heremyte says in vitas patrum / that one hete be put with the other / for
as god says / there is no good deed done / but that it shall be guerdonned /
Ne none euylle done / but that it shall be punysshed /

How the daughter of a knight lost her marriage Capitulo Cxix
I Shall tell you another Ensample of the daughter of a noble knight / that
lost her marriage by her coynted Raymentes and clothynges / A knyt was which
had many daughters of the which theldest was wedded / It happed that a knight
demanded the second daughter to be his wife / and the fader granted her to him
/ He that never before had seen her came to be fyaunced with her / And she
which knew well of his coming arrayed and coynted her self in the best manner
that she could / to the end that she might seem the fayrer / smaller / and of of
body well shapen / She had upon her but a straight cote furred. It was at that
season much cold / and great wind rose up and blewe / And she which was
symply clothed had great cold / in so much that for cold she wexed black /
Then arrived the knight which came for to see her / and saw her color deed
and pale / also he beheld her other suster / which had the co^our read and
fresshe / For she was clothed with gowns good and warm as she that thought
not soon to be married The knight beheld well the one and the other / And after
dinner he called to him two of his parents / which were come with him / And
said to them / Fair lords we be come hyder to see the daughters of the lord of
this place / And by cause I know well that to my wife I may have the which I
will ch^se of them / therefore I shall have the third daughter / Then said
his parents unto him / Ye say not well / for gretter worship shall be to you to
take the oldest / Fair friends ansuerd the knight / I see in the choys but
lytill advantage / ye wot and know well how they have a suster wedded /
which is older than they be and first born / I see the third more fair and
fresshe / and of better color than the second / of the which men have spoken
to me / In the third is my plesaunce and my love set therefore before any
other / I will have her / his parents then ansuerd to him / that he should
do after his playsyre / And then he made to demand and ask the third
daughter for to be his wife / And the fader did grant her to him / whereof many
one were merueylled / And she specially / which wend to be married was sore
abashed and sorrowful / It befelle a little while after / that this second
douter which had lost the knight by cause of the great cold which caused her
vysage to be of euylle color when she was well clothed and that she had on
her such a gown as she was wont to couere her as it was cold wether / her
color came to her ageyn / and fressher by a great dele / than her suster did /
which the knight had wedded / In so much that the knight merueylled him
much thereof / and said unto her / Fair suster when I came for to see you /
and that I took your suster / ye were not so fair by much / as ye now be /
For ye be now of color fresshe white and read / and that time ye were black
and pale / and your suster was fayrer / but now ye pass her of beauty /
wherefore I have great merueylle / Then said his wife / which was there
present / Sire I shall tell all the manner how hit was / My suster that ye see
here thought and wend / and also deed we al / that ye should come for to have
fyaunced her / wherefore she coynted and arrayed her self in the most praty manner
that she couthe for to show her body praty and small and well shapen / but the
cold was at that time great / the which made her black and palysshed her
color / and I which thought ne wend not to receive so great worship as to be
your wife / coynted not my self / but I was well clothed with furred gounes that
kept my body warm / wherefore I had better color than she had / whereof I
thank god / For therefore / I gate your love / And blessed be the hour that my
suster clothed her self so light / For if it had not be so / ye had not take me
for to have left her / Thus lost as ye have herd theldest daughter her
marriage by cause she coynted her self / Now have ye herd good Ensample how one
ought not to coynte her body for to show it small and better shapen and
specially in the winter / in so much that she lost her manner and color / As
ones it befell to Sire Foucques delaual / as he told me upon the fayt of this
Ensample / of whom I shall speak and tell unto you what that happed to him /

How love will be kept warm / Capitulo Cxx
sIre Foucques de laual was a fair knight clean and well besene among other /
and was of good manner / and of fair maynten / It happed to him as he told me
that ones he was gone for to see his peramours in the winter season that the
froste was great and the wether passing cold / He then had in the morning
coynted him self of a scarlatte gown well broudred / and of a hood of scarlatte
sengle and without furrynge / and naught else he had on him sauf only his fyn
sherte / For he had no mantell neither gloves in his hands / The wynd and the
cold were great / wherefore he had so great cold / that he became of color
black and pale / For the perles ne the precious stones / wiche were on the
broudryng of his sengle gown couthe give him no hete / ne keep him fro the
cold / There came another knight / which also was amerous of that lady / but
he was not so gay aourned / ne so sengle of clothes / but he had on him good
and warm gowns / and had a mantell / and a double hood / and was reed as a
cok / and had a good living color / The lady then welcomed this knight /
and maade to him better chere / than she did to Sire Foucques / and held with
him better company / And said to Sire Foucques / Sire hold you nere the fire /
for I doubt / that ye be not al hool / for your color is deed and pale / And
he ansuerd that his heart was joyous and well at his ease / This other knight
was fayrer to the lady sight / than Foucques / But within a while after Sire
Foucques aspyed the knight / which was going toward the place of his
peramours / He arrayed him otherwise than he was wont to do And so much hyed
him / that he came thither / as soon as the other knight did / for to preue how
the matter and his faytte should end / But certainly he was then take of his
lady for the fairest and best colored / wherefore he told me how love will be
kept hot and warm / And how that he had approuned hit / Therefore hit is
great folly to keep his body sengle of clothes for to seem to the folks sight
better maad / and fayrer of body / Yet upon this matere I will reherce unto
you a great merueylle / how many one deyd for cold /

Of the folysshe love / which surprysed and overcame the Galoys and the
Galoyses / wherefore many one of them deyd for cold / Capitulo Cxxj
Air daughters I shall tell you of the galoys and galoyses / how the deuylle
by his art made many of them to deye for cold with the help of the flamme of
venus goddess of love and of lecherye / It byfelle then in the parties of
peytou and in other Countrees nyghe / that the goddess Venus which has great
power upon yongthe / that is to wete upon the young folk / For sum she
makes to be amerous of love reasonable / And other of folysshe love and
unreasonable / whereof sum lose their honor and worship / And other both body
and soul and made many knights and squyers ladies and damoysels to love
peramours each other / And to make an ordenaunce of a much savage and wyld
guyse / and against the kind of the time / which ordenaunce was this that in
the somer they should be clothed hot and warm with their furred gowns and
with mantels and double hoodes / And ever fire they should have in their
chemenyes / were it never so great a hete / And that they should make of the
somer winter / and thus to the contrary / In the winter time / and as it was
hard frosen these galoys and galoyses did on their shertes but only a short
and sengle gown without lynyng and had no mantell ne hood but sengle for no
great cold ne wynd that might come / And yet more their chambres were without
fire and daily made swyped clean / And if at that season any herb or grass or
sum thing fresshe and grene might be found / it was had in to their chambres
and strawed on the floor / And upon their beds they had through all the night
but only a sengle and light couerlet. and no more they might have after their
own ordinance / Ferthermore it was ordained that as soon as a galoys came
there as a galoyse was / and if she had any husbond / he must by this ordenaunce
go and take the galoys horses / which last was come thither / and ride out of
his place / and never to come again as long as the galoys should be with his
wife / And also if her husbond were a galoys and went to see his peramours
another galoyse and found her husbond with her / it had be great shame to the
husbond / if he had abyden at home neither to have ordained any thing / whiles
the galoys had be with his wife / for he had then no more power within his
hows than had a stranger / This life lasted long while unto the time that the
most part of them was deed and perysshed of the great cold / which they
suffered Many of the galoys deyde in their ladies bed / And so deed in like
wise the galoyses with their friends and peramours scornynge them that were
warm and well clothed / And some of them were to whom men must dysseuere their
teethe with knyues / and toste and Roast them before the fire as a chyken hard
of ^roste / Wherefore I doubt much that these galoyses and galoys which deyde
by such manner were martired by love / and that as they deyde of cold / they
shall have to the contrary a great hete and a warm clothing in the pytte of
hell / For if they had suffered for the love of god which suffered so much
for them the tenthe part of the pain and dolor which they did suffer for
the foul delight of their stynkynge lecherye / they should have had mercy and
great guerdon in the other world / But the deuylle which ever is about to
make the man and the woman to dysobeye to god / made them to feel gretter
delight and playsaunce in folysshe love / than to do sum seruyse unto god /
And by this reason which well is approuued how the devil tempts and essayeth
man and woman And holds in peril both the soul and the body / And hou he
gives folysshe playsaunces and many euylle manners / that is to wete sum by
couetyse to draw to him the good and substance of other / And sum he
holds in great pride by the praysyng of them self and dispraysynge of other /
Some also by envy when they see other have more goods than they / Also by
glotonye / wherein the body delyteth him self / and makes him to fall in to
the sin of dronkeship / which sin takes fro them reason and entendement /
and makes them to fall in to carnal delight / Either also by lecherye making
them to have their peramours with them / and to love them with folysshe love
and playsaunce / As did the folysshe galoys and galoyses / and among them
such a folysshe and brennynge love that he brought them to an euylle end /
and to deye of diverse death / But notwithstondyng all this I say not but that
there is a true love without blame and dishonor / And whereof much worship
comes / These ben true / the which require nothing wherout may come any
falshed or abusion For he yt loves not trewely thinks for to have
dishonored his love and her estate / And such love is not true / but is false
dyssymylynge and trecherye / Therefore to great Iustyse may not be made of them
/ but so much I tell you well / that there be of such folk / which ben of
diverse manners / that is to wete / some true / sum falls and deceyuable / and
give no force at al / but to have their foul delight and will / And many such
folk is as now in this world / wherefore the world is hard to know and much
merueyllous / And such wene well to know them self / but wors they know them
self than done any other

The Argument of the knight of the Tower and of his wife Capitulo Cxxi^
mY dear daughters as for to love peramours I shall tell you all the debate and
stryf of me and of your mother I would sustain ageynste her / that a lady or
damoyselle might love peramours in certain caas / For in love is but good
worship / without any evil be thought in it In this then wherein is thought
any euylle is not love / but rather it is great falshede and mauuastye /
wherefore take ye ^^de And here ye the great debate and stryf which was between
her and me / Thus then I said to your mother / Lady w^y shall not the ladies
and damoysels love peramours / For in certain me seems that in good love and
true may be but welthe and honor / and also the lover is the better therefore
and more gay and Ioly / and also the more encouraged to excercyse him self more
often in arms / And takes therefore better manner in all estates for to please
unto his lady or l^ue / And in like wise does she of whom he is enamoured for
to please him the better as far as she loves him / And also I tell you that
great alms it is when a lady or damoysell makes a good knight / either a
good squire / These ben my reasons

The answer which the lady of the tower maad unto her lord Capitulo Cxxij
Then ansuerd to me your mother / Sire I merueyll me not / if among you men
sustain and hold this reason that al women ought to love peramours / But
since this debate and stryf is come before our own daughters / I will answer
after mine aduys and Intencion / For unto our children we must hyde nothing /
Ye say / and so done all other men that a lady or damoysell is the better worth
/ when she loves peramours / And that she shall be the more gay and of fair
manner and countenance / And how she shall do great alms to make a good
knight / These words are but sport and esbatement of lords and of felawes in
a langage much common / For they that say that all the honor and worship
which they get and have is coming to them by their peramours / And that
their love encourages them to goo in vyages / And for to plese to them by
state of arms / but these words cost to them but little to say for to get
the better and sooner the grace and good will of their peramours / For of
such words and other much merueyllous many one uses full often / but how be
hit that they say that for them and for their love they done hit / In good
feyth / they done it only for to enhaunce them self / and for to draw unto
them the grace and vain glory of the world / Therefore I charge you my fair
daughters that in this matter ye believe not your fader / But I pray you that ye
hold your self clenly and without blame / and that ye be not amerous for many
reasons / which I shall reherce unto you / First I say not / but that every
good woman of age may love well and better the one than the other / that is to
wete / folk of worship and honor / And them also / that shall counceylle her
for her own health and worship / And thus men ought to love by this manner /
the one more than the other / But as for to be so ferforth enamoured / in so
much that this love be master of her / and makes them to fall in sum
foul and shameful delight / sometime with right / and sometime with wrong / for
the watch which men have upon this shameful deed or feate / and also such
dishonor and escry / which soon is not put out / And by the false watches
and bacbyters which ben never cessyng to talk of some euylle rather than of
sum good / whereby they take away and dyffamen the good Renomme of the good
wymmen and of many a good lady / And therefore all wymmen / which ben not
wedded may keep and hold them self fro hit / And that for many Reasons / The
first Reason is / by cause that a woman which is enamoured of a man may not
serve god of no good heart ne true / as she did before / For many one I have
herd say / the which have been amerous in their yong^^e that when they were in
the church / their thought and Melancolye made them often to think unto their
delytes / and to their peramours / more than they did to the seruyse of God /
And also the art of love is of such kind / that when one is in the Church
to here mass and the dyuyne seruyse / and as the priest holds the body of
our lord between his hands than comes most to his mind euylle and foul
thoughts / This is the art or craft of the goddess that men call Venus the
which had the name of a planete as I herd say of a good and true man /
which preched and said how ones the deuylle entered in to the body of a dampened
woman / which was Ioly and gaye / and much amerous / The deuylle that was
within her body made her to do many falls miracles / wherefore the paynyms held
her for a goddess and worshipped her as a god / And this Venus was she that
gaf coun^^ylle to the Trojans / that they should send Paris the sone of king
Priamus in to greece / and that she should make him rauysshe and have with him
the fairest lady of al greece / whereof she said truth / For paris did rauysshe
the fair Helayne / the wife of the king Menelaus / for the which faytte or
deed were slain afterward more than xl kings and xiiCM other persons and mo
/ whereof this Venus was of al this great meschyef pryncipall cause / She was an
euylle goddess / fulle of euylle temptacion / She is the goddess of love
which kyndeleth and chauffeth the amerous hertes / and makes them to think
both day and night to the Joy and foul delytes of lechery / And specially
when they be at the mass or heryng the dyuyn seruyse / the devil causes this
for to trouble their feythe / and their devotion which they have toward our
lord / And know ye for certain my fair daughters / that a woman which is
amerous shall never set her heart to god / ne she shall not say deuoutely
her hours or matyns ne the heart open for to here the dyuyne seruyse of god /
whereof I shall tell you an Ensample / Two queen's were at this side of the sea
/ which in lent upon the holy thursday in the passion weke took their foul
delytes and playsaunce within the Church / during the seruyse dyuyne / And
rested not of their folly tylle hit was all done / wherefore god / which was
displeased with them / for their enorme and foul sin made their foul deed
and faytte to be openly known among the folk / In such wise / that they
were take / and put under a great and heavy coope of led / And there they
deyd of an euylle death / And the two knights their putyers deyd also as they
that were flayne they being yet on live / Now may ye see how their falls love
was euylle and dampnable / And how the temptacion of Venus the goddess of love
/ and lady of lechery tempted them so much that she made them to take their
foul plesaunce In such holy time as upon the thursday and holy frydaye in the
^assyon weke / By this Ensample is well seen and known / how that every woman
amerous is more tempted within the Church than in any other place / And the
same is the first reason / how a young woman must keep her self fro such
folysshe love / and not be in no wise amerous / The other rayson is by cause of
many gentylle men which ben so falls and deceyuab^e that they require every
gentylle woman that they may find / And to them they swear that they shall
keep to them their feythe / and be true to them / and shall love them without
falshed or deceyuaunce / and that rather they should deye / than to think any
vylonye or dyshonoure / And that they shall be the better preysed for the love
of them / And that if they have any good and worship / it shall come by them /
And thus they shall show and say to them so many reasons and abusions that a
great meruaylle is to here hem speak / And yet more they give out of their
breasts great and feigned syghes / And make as they were thinking and
Melancolyous / And after they cast a falls look / And then the good and
debonayr wymmen that seen them / supposen / that they be esprysed of true and
feythfull love / but al such manner of folk / which vsen to make such
semblaunt / ben but deceyuours or be gylers of the ladies and damoysels / For
there is no lady ne damoysell that would here them / but that they should be
deceived of them by their falls reasons / which they should not here These ben
contrary to the feythfulle and true lovers / For he that loves with god and
true love / as he comes before his peramours / he is ferynge and dredefull
lest he do any thing that may displease her / For he is not so hardy to
discouere ne say one only word / And if he love her well I wene that he shall
be three or four year er he dar say his secret unto her / But thus do not the false lovers / For they pray al them that they find as above is said / And are
not in dread ne in fere to say all that comes upon their falls tongues / And no
shame ne vergoyne they have of hit / And all that which they may understand of
them / they reherce and tell it among their felawes / And of them they hold
their talking / whereof they laugh and scorn and take their disporte of hit /
And thus by such a way / they mock and scorn the ladies and damoysels and
make new talkynges and lesynges of them / which before were never said ne
spoken of / For they to whom they tellen hit / put to it rather sum evil /
than sum good In so much that fro word to word and by such mocking and
fryuolles many ladies and damoysels ben often blamed

How a woman ought not to here the words or talking of him that requires her
of love / Capitulo Cxxiiij
aNd to the end ye be not deceived / keep you well fro the talking of them / And
if one begin to resonne and talk with you of such matter / let him alone /
or else call to you sum other body to here him say what he will And thus ye
shall void and break his talking / And know you for certain / that if ye
do thus ones or twyes / he shall no more speak to you thereof / but in good
feyth at the last he shall preyse and dread you / and shall say / this woman
is assured and ferme / And by this manner of way ye shall not be put in their
Ianglory and talkynges / and shall not also have no blame ne diffame of the
world /

How the knight answers to his wife / Capitulo Cxxv
Then I ansuerd / Lady ye be much hard and evil in as much that ye will
not suffer that your daughters be amerouse / And if so came that sum gentyl
knight / worshipful / mighty / and puyssaunt enough after their degree had
set his heart on one of them / and be willing to love her / and take her to
his wife / why shall she not love him Sire said his wife / To this I shall
ansuere you / It is so as to me seems / that every woman / maid / or wydowe /
may well beat her self with her own staf / For all men ben not of one co^dycion
/ ne of one manner / for that thing / which pleseth to one is dyspleasyng to
the other / And sum ben / the which taken great playsyre of the great chere
and semblaunt that is done to them / And that thynken but good and honest /
And some also ben therefore more curyous to demand and ask their peramours to
be their wives / But many other ben which are not of such manner / but all
contrary / For when they see / that their peramours paynen them self to make
them chere / they preyse them less / And within their hertes ben doubtyng of
them / And as they see them so light of will and so enamowred / they leave them
/ and demand them not for to be their wives / And thus many one for to show
them self to much amerous / and for to be to much open in beholdynge / and in
gyuynge fair semblaunt / lose their marriage / For in certain they that keep
them symply / and the which given no fair token or semblaunt to one no more
than to other / ben most preysed / and they be therefore the sooner wedded /
whereupon ye told me ones an ensample which I have not forgeten which happed to
you of a lady / to whom I give no name / the which ye went ones to see her
willing to take her in marriage She that wist and knew well how it was spoken
of you and her for her marriage / maade to you as great chere / as she had
loved and known your person all the days of her life / ye prayed her of love
/ but by cause that she which was not wise enough to ansuere you curtoysly and
well / ye demanded her not / And if she had hold self more secret and covered
/ and more symply / ye had take her to your wife / of whom I have syn herd say
/ that she has be blamed / but I wot not for certain if it was so / And
certainly Sire ye be not the first / to whom such adventure is happed / For
many wymmen have lost their marriage / by cause of their amerous look and fair
semblaunt / Therefore it is good to every woman unwedded for to behave her
symply and clenely / and specially before them / of whom is spoken for her
marriage / I say not but that men must bear honor to every one after that
they be

How men ought to love after his estate and degree Capitulo Cxxvj
wHat say you lady / would ye have kept them so straightly / that they should not
take sum plesaunce / more to sum than to the other / Sire I will not /
that they have or take any plesaunce of them that been of lower estate or degree
than they be of / that is to wete that no woman unwedded shall not set her
love upon no man of lower or less degree than she is of / For if she took him
/ her parents and Friends should hold her lassed and hyndered / These which
louen such folk done ageynste their worship and honor For men ought to
desire ne coueyte nothing so much in this world as worship and the friendship
of the world / and of her Friends / the which is lost as soon as she draws
out her self out of the government and fro the counceyll of them as I might
tell if I would an Ensample of many which therefore ben dyffamed and hated of
their parents and Friends

And therefore Sire as I their mother charge and deffende them / that they take
no playsaunce ne that in no wise set their love to none of lower degree than
they be come of / Ne also to none of hyhe estate / which they may not have to
their lord For the great lords shall not take them to their wives / but all
their loving look and semblaunt they do it for to deceive them / and for to
have the delytes and playsaunce of their bodies / and for to bring them in to
the folly of the world

How wedded wymmen which have set their love to some of lower degree than
they be of / are not worthy to be called wymmen / Capitulo Cxxvij
aLso they which put and set their love on three manner of folk / that is
to wete wedded men / prestes and monks / and as to servants and folk of
naught These manner of wymmen which take to their peramours and love such
folk / I hold them of none extyme ne valewe / but that they be more gretter
harlottes / than they that been daily at the bordell / For many wymmen of the
world done that sin of lechery / but only for need and pouerte / or else by
cause they have been deceived of hit by false counceylle of bawdes / But all
gentylle women which have enough to live on / the which make their peramours
or lovers such manner of folk as before is said / it is by the great ease
wherein they be / and by tbe brennynge lecherye of their bodies / For they know
well / that after the law of their marriage they may not have for their lords /
ne to be their husbondes men of the church ne other of no valewe / This love
is not for to recouere any worship / but all dishonor and shame

How hit is alms to enhaunce a man in to great valor / Capitulo Cxxviij
aT the least sith ye will not grant ne accord / that your daughters love
no man peramours / as long as they shall be unwedded / please it you to
suffer / that when they shall be wedded / they may take sum plesaunce of
love for to hold and behave them self the more gaye and Ioyefull / and for the
better know their behauynge and manner emonge folk of worship / And as before
this time / I have said to you / It were to them great welthe and worship / to
make a man of none extyme ne of valewe to become of great valor

The answer of the lady of the Tower / Capitulo Cxxix
sIre to this I ansuere you / I will well and am content that they make good
chere to all worshipfulle men / And more to sum than to the other / that is
to wete / to them of gretter name and more gentyl / or else better men of their
persons / And after that they bear to them worship and honor / And that they
sing and dance before them honorably / But as for to love peramours sithe
they shall be wedded / without it be of such love as men ought to bear unto
folk of worship for to love and worship them after that they be worthy and
of valor / And which have had great pain and trauaylle to get and acquere
glory and worship by their valyaunce in arms / These must be loved / doubted
served and honored without having in them any plesau^ce / sauf only for the
bounte of them / But to say and hold hit good / that a wedded woman should love
and have a peramour / Ne take the oath and feythe of none / to the end / that
they be their lovers and peramours / Ne also to give their feith and oath to
none / I trow and wene certainly / that no lady ne damoysell wedded ne woman
of other estate / shall not put her estate and worship in this balaunce for
many reasons / the which I shall declare unto you / whereof the first is as
before I told you / that none woman amerous shall never be so devout in her
prayers / ne to here the seruyse of god / as she was before / For out of love
spryngen and comen to many thoughts and Melancolye as men sayn / And many one
ben so enamoured and enflammed of love that if they herd ryng the last peel of
a mass / and that they knew that their peramoure would have come to see them /
they should lose the mass for to please to their peramoure / This is no game
egaly parted / But such is the temptacion of Venus the goddess of lecherye /
The other Reason I do compare to the mercer / which weyeth his sylke which
is fyn and light / but yet he may put so much of it in to the balaunce / that
it shall ouerbere the weight which is at the other side of the balaunce /
That is to say that the woman may be so much enamoured / that less she
shall love her lord therefore / and that the love / worship and cheuaunce
which he should have / she shall take fro him / and give it to other / And for
certain a woman may not have two hertes / no more than a greyhond may run
after two bestes / Therefore Impossyble is that she might love her peramour of
true love and her lord also without fault or deceyuaunce But god and Reason
naturell constrayneth her / For as the clerks say and the predycatours / god
began the world by marriage of man and woman / And god him self when he came
in to this world / he spoke and treated at a sermon / that he made of marriage /
saying that marriage is a sacrament Joined and annexed of god to the man and the
woman / and how they be but one body / and that they ought to love each other
more than fader ne mother / ne other creature / And therefore sith that god has
assembled them / no man mortal out not to separe them / ne take fro them the
love / which is between them / This said god of his own mouth / And therefore
at the door where as the priest makes them to swe re that they shall love and
keep each other both seek and hole / And that they shall not gwerpysshe or
leave each other for none other better or worse / And therefore I say / sith the
creator of all the creatures said so it is but one thing and one body that men
ought to gwerpysshe and leave al other worldly love for to take the love which
ought to be in marriage / how then should the wedded woman give her love ne do
any oath to some other without consent of her lord / I trow that after the
will of god and the commandments of holy church that this may not dewely
be done without feythe be broken of one side or of there / and many horrible
deeds done / For in good feythe I doubt not but that they which ben amerous
and given their feythe to other men louen but little or naught their husbondes
/ and that they be cursed of god /

How a woman which will keep her honor must do ne show no manner of
semblaunt to none / Capitulo Cxxx
tHere ben yet other Reasons for to keep the love of her lord clenely without
danger or parylle / that is to wete against enuyous folk that have euylle and
cursed tongues / which maken the false reports / that is to say / that if any
woman makes sum semblaunt of love to some man / And if that sum other her
servant / or any other body perceyueth it / As they shall be departed fro her
/ they anon shall talk and speak thereof before the folk / And thus shall the
words so far goo / that at the last men shall say / that she has fawted
in deed / and by this manner is a good and true woman blamed and dishonored /
And if hit befalle that by sum adventure her lord have any knowlechynge of
hit. he shall take her in hate / and of hertely love he shall never love her
/ And ever he shall say euylle of her / And thus is the true love of marriage
lost and go fro them / and never parfyght Joy ne love shall they have to
gyder / And therefore great parylle is to every wedded woman to put her lord and
his estate and the welthe and Joy of her marriage in this balau^ce and in such
peryllous aue^ture / wherefore I cou^ceyll not to no good woman to have any
peramour ne to be amerous / in so much that she be subget to other than to her
lord / for by such a cause many good maryages have been left and forgoten / and
for one word that is come thereof an C euyls ben comen therefore / I shall tell
you thereof one example of them which ben deed / and have fynysshed their lives
by the peryls which ben in folysshe love / The lady of Coussy and her
peramoure deide thereof / and also did the Castellayne of the verger / And after
her the Duchess / And also many other deyde thereof only for the love and the
most part without Confession or shryfte / wherefore / I wot not how they do
in the other world / But I doubt not / but that the delytes and playsaunces
which they took thereof in this world / shall be to them derely sold / And
the delytes of them that been amerous ben such / that for one Joy that they
receive of hit / they suffer and have therefore an C dolours / And for one
worship honderd shames / And ever I have herd say / that a woman amerous
shall never after love her lord with good heart / but that she shall ever be
in Melancolye and in small thoughts

How a knight loved the lady of the toure / Ca / Cxxxj
lAdy ye make me to be merueylled / how that ye so sore discounceylle them to
love / Wene ye to do me to by leave that ye be so true in your speaking / that
ye never were amerous / certainly I have well herd the complaynte of some / of
whom ye hold well your pees / Sire said the lady I trow that ye would not
believe me if I told to you the very truth thereof / but as for to say I have been prayed of love / I have many times perceived how sum men were about to
speak to me thereof / but ever I brake their words / and called to me sum
other / whereby I did break their faytte / whereof ones hit befelle as many
knights and ladies were playenge with me / that a knight said to me / how that
he love all the ladies that been in this world / And I did demand and asked
him if hit was long syn that sekenes and euylle had taken him / and he ansuerd
that it was well ij year gone and past and that never he durst tell it to me /
I then ansuerd to him that it was nothing of that space of time / and that
he hasted him to much / and that it was but a temptacion and that he should goo
to the church for to cast upon him holy water / and that he should say his Aue
maria / and that his temptacion should sone after go fro him / For the love was
new / And he demanded of me why / And then I said to him / that none
peramoure or lover ought not to say to his lady / that he loves her / till
the time of seven year and an half be passyd and gone / and that it was but a
little tem^tacion / Then he wend to have argued / and put many reasons unto
me / when I said al on high / Behold ye all what says this knight / which
is but two year syn he loved first one lady / and then he ^rayd that I should
keep my pees thereof and that in good fey^he he should never speak to me thereof /
But at the last he said to me L^dy of the Tower ye be much euylle and strange
/ and also after your words over proud in love / I doubt that ye have not be
ever so strange / Ye be like the lady of the ^ualle / which said to me thus
that she would never here ne understand the noote and words of none / sauf one
time that a knight pra^d her / but she had an uncle which she made to hyde
him self behynd her / for to here and understand what that the knight should
seye / wherein she did great treason / For he wend well secretly to say his
rayson / and wend not that any one had herd him / but her self alone / wherefore
I dare almost say that both you and she be but great spekers / and little
pyteous of them that require mercy and grace / And she is of your oppynyon /
that no ladies or damoysels may not disporte them with none other tha^ with
their lord for the resons / which ye have said before / but sire said then
the lady of the tour to her lord / as for your daughters ye may say to them
and charge them of that what shall befalle you / but after the faytte or deed
right shall be done / Sire I pray to god that to worship and honor they may
come / as I desire / For mine entencion and will is not to ordeyne upon none
ladies ne damoysels / but if hit be upon mine own daughters / of whom I have
the chastysement and charge / For every good lady or damoyselle if god be
pleased shall govern and keep hem self well to their worship and honor
without I that am of little wit and little knowing entremete me thereof /

Yet speaks the knight of the Toure / Capitulo Cxxxij
aT the lest my lady I will yet argue to you saying that if she may seem to
come unto worship and valor / the which had never ne also should have courage
ne hardynes to put him self in pain to have hit / but it were for the love and
playsyr of his lady / and by good trust to be a good knight and Renommed among
the valiant and hardy for to get worship and the grace of his peramour / And
for a little chere a man coming of low degree may be enhaunced by his love /
and be compted among the worthy and valiant

How one must be wyly and subtle for to discouere his love / Capitulo Cxxxiij
sIre hit seems me that there be many manners of love / And as men say the one
is better than the other / for if hit be so that a knight or squire loves
sum lady or damoyselle by worship and honor only / And for to keep her
worship and the curtosye of her and for the good that she shall do to him /
such love is good which is without prayer or request / What lady / if he
requires her to kiss or embrace him / it is no force / the wyndes blown it
awey / Ha a Sire I answer unto you / that as well to my daughters as to other^
that me seems / And thereto I consent / that they may make to them good chere
/ and that they kiss them before all to the end that they lose not their valor
/ but as for my daughters which ben here present I defend and withsaye to
them the kyssyng and all such manners of disportes / For the wise lady Rebecca
which was right gentylle and noble / says / the kissing is nyghe parente and
Cosyn unto the foul faytte or deed / And Sybylle says that the first sign or
token of love is the look or beholding / And after the amerous look they come
to the kissing / and then the deed or faytte / The which deed takes awey
the love and worship of god and of the world and thus they come from one deed
to another / and I let you know that me seems that as soon as they suffer them
to be kyssed they put them self in the subjection of the devil / which is to
subtle / For such one weneth well at the beginning to keep him fermely and be
strong / the which he deceyueth by his subtle art and craft / and by such
kyssynges / And thus as one kissing draws to him another / And as the fire
kyndeleth a straw / and fro that straw it comes / and kyndeleth another /
and thus at last the bed is a fire and the hows also / In like wise is it
of such love / And yet I charge you my fair daughters / that ye be no players
/ For such playeng causes oftyme many a folysshe look / and beholdynge / by
the which may perauentur come blame and euylle renomme / I herd ones reherce
and say a tale of the duchess of bauyere / how that she had well twenty
subgettes as men said the which loved her / and to each of them she gaf sign
and token of love / She played wi^h them at the tables / and wan of them
coursers and hakneys and dear and rich furrynges and also rings and precious
stones / and many other Jewels and great prouffyte she had by them / But for
certain she could never keep her self so well / but that at the last s^he was
blamed and dyffamed / And better it had be for her worship / that she had
bought and paid all that she had of them / half derer more than it was worth
/ Therefore great peril is to every lady or damoysell and to all other good
and worshipful wymmen to use such playenge and be of such life / For the most
appertyse and wise find them self at the last by such delynge mocked and
blamed / and foul dyffamed / And therefore my fair daughters take ye here good
ensample / and be ye not to curyous to any play for to win such ouches or
fer^aylles For by the covetousness to get and have such Jewels for naught many
a woman put her self in subjection / and oftyme it befalls therefore that they
be deceived / And thus is it good to advise and beware him self before the
coming of the stroke /

How the holy lady approuued the Heremyte / Ca / Cxxxv
Fair daughters I will tell you one of the last ensamples of this book / It
is of a full good lady / which is much to be preysed / And this ensample is
reherced in the book of Vitas Patrum / how the wife of the provost of Acquylee
approved an holy Heremyte by his bounte /

There was then an holy Heremyte in an heremytage / the which had been there
by the space of xxv year / where as he ete but breed and herbs and Rotes / And
often he fasted / and was of good and holy living / This good and holy Here
myte began ones upon a time to say / A good lord my creator and my maker /
if against the I have any thing mysprysed I demand and cry to the mercy /
And if I have this xxv year done any good dwelling stylle in this Heremytage /
what merit shall I have therefore / A vysyon came sone to him / by the which
him thought that he saw our lord / which said to him / thou shall have the
merit of the provost of Acquylee and of his wife / And then when he head
seen this vysyon / he said that he should never rest tylle he come in to
Acquyllee for to enquere of the life and condycions of the provost and of his
wife / He went thither / And as god would through the grace of the holy ghoost the
provost and his wife knew well the coming of this Heremyte / and the cause also
why he came thither / It befelle then as the Heremyte was nyghe by the Town /
he saw the provost / which issued out of hit with a great company of men /
and went to make Iustyse of a Squire / which had slain another Squire / And
was the provost riding upon a fair courser / And had on him a fair gown of
sylke rychely furred / And all his men that were about him well clothed and
arrayed / And as soon as the prouoste saw the Heremyte / he knew him / as the
will of god was / and called him / and said / good and true man / goo ye home
to my wife / and take her this ring And tell her / that she do to you as she
would do to me The Heremyte demanded of him what he was / And he answered to
him that he was the provost of Acquyllee / The Heremyte then that saw him in
such estate and so Rychely clothed / was abashed / and right sore merueylled
/ that he was so coyntely arrayed / and that he went for to make a man to be
hanged / He wist not what he should think or say / and was al troubled and
abashed / And him thought / that he had nothing deserved of god / But
nevertheless he went to the prouostes place / and found there the lady his wife
/ to whom he took the ring / and said unto her that her lord sent him thither
/ And that she should do to him / as she would do to him self / The good lady
received him / and made the table to be couerd and prayed him to sytte before
her / She made him to be served of great plente of good and delycate metes and
of good wynes / And the Heremyte which was not wont to have before him such
metes / Nevertheless he ete and drank there / And saw how the good lady took
the good metes that were put before her / and how she brake and dressed the
good capons and other metes / And then she did put it al to gyder in a great
dysshe / and sent it to the pour folk / And took only for her refection
bread and water / And thus she did every day both at souper and at dinner / And
as the even ca^e she had the Heremyte in to her chamber / which was rychely
hanged with cloth of sylke and nobly dressed and arrayed and said to him / good
and true man ye shall lie in the bed of my lord and in his chamber / The
Heremyte would have reffused it / but the lady said that she would do the
commandment of her lord / And that for certain he should lie there / There s^e
made to be brought to him good spyces and strong and good wynes / whereto the
good Heremyte took so good a sauoure that he ete and drank so much / that
he was drunk and full Joyous in his speaking / For the good wyn had soon
ouercomen him / by cause he was not wont to drink of hit / He went to bed
/ and the lady vndyd her clo^^es ^ and leyde her self by him / and began to
embrace and ta^^e him / And the Heremyte that much had taken of metes and
drynkes / awaked / and his flesh began sore to be meuyd / And would have
accomplysshed the faytte or deed of fornycacion with the lady / Then said she
to him Sweet Friend when my lord will have to do with me of such thing / he
goes first to bathe and wassheth him self in that Tubbe / which ye see
yonder full of water for to be the more clean and fair / And theremyte which
thought to nothing than to fulfylle and accomplysshe his will sterte in the
tubbe full of water / and bathed and washed him in the water / which was cold
as any yse / and anon he was as half deed of cold / Then the lady called him
to her / And he came all shaking / For his hete was gone / and also his
euylle will And the lady embraced him again so much that he gate hete / and
was so chauffed that he would have done his folysshe delight / And as she saw
him so chauffed and so brennyng in that foul delight of lecherye / she prayed
him that he would for the love of her goo and wasshe him again in the tubbe for
to be the clener / And he that yet had not slepte and was full of mighty and
strong wynes / as a man out of his wit rose up out of the bed / and
went / and bathed him ageyn in to the tubbe / And anon the cold water made
him feeble and hard for cold / Then the lady called him to her again / And
shaking he came to her as he did before / his teeth shoke / and beat each
other for cold / And all his great here was passed and gone / The lady roose
up and covered him well with warm clothes / and left him alone / to the end he
should take his rest / And soon after as he was a little warm / he fylle in
to a sleep / for his head was right pesaunt and heavy / And he awoke not tylle
the morrow was come / To his rysynge came an old priest or chappellayne / which
demanded him how he deed / And when he perceived that he lay in so fair a
bed / and that he was so taken and surprysed / he was full of shame and much
merueylled how in that dronkeship and folysshe will he was fall / He then
saw well / that they were of gretter merit than he was / And demanded of the
Chappellayne of the life and governance of the Provost and of his wife / And he
told him that the most part of the days of the year they wered the hair /
And that the good metes which were brought at the table before them / they
sent to pour folk / and ete black bread and metes of little sauoure and
drank but water / And how they fasted the most part of the weke / He after
demanded of him why that tubbe full of cold water Was set by their bed /
And he answered that it was put there for to keep them fro the brennynge will
of lecherye / for as soon as she or he is chauffed and their flesh mouyng to
that foul delight / they rise out of the bed / and wasshe and bathe them self
in this tubbe / which is full of water / except one day of the weke / Then
as theremyte had this examyned the old Chappellayne upon the faytte of the
provost and of the lady his wife / and that he was well certain how they led
their life / he thought that the provost / how be it that he were nobly and
Rychely arrayed without / and to the sight of the folk / which secretly
unknowing to no man bare and had on his flesh the hair / and made good
Justice and the execucion of the mysdoers to be done and executed before him
was worthy to have and also his wife seven times more merit / For he remembryd
him of the foul deed / which he would have commysed or done with the good lady
/ And how she essayed / whereof he was much vergoynous and shamefull^ and
within his heart he cursed him self that ever he departed out of his
heremytage / and that in truth he was not worthy (...) pulle of their shone
and hosen fro their legs / wherefore fro thens he departed shameful and
weeping / saying with a high voys / Fair god and good lord / I know no
gretter tresour more noble / ne more precious than is the good lady / which
has essayed me / seen my folly / and approuued my fallace and decepcion / And
verily she is well worthy to be called and named the precious Margaryte / as ye
said in the Euangely / Thus spoke the holy Heremyte in him self allone And
repented him of his mysdede / and humbly cried to god mercy / praysynge the
good lady of her good life / Therefore a woman is to be preysed / when she
essayeth her self / and that she can resist against the temptacions of the
devil / and against the feebleness of her mortal flesh / the folysshe will of
her foul delight / And then as that foul and dampnable delight is by them
accomplysshed and done / they repent them of it / but it is to late / For the
devil as he has purchaced and brought them thereto / he holds them in his
subjection / and for his servants / and assembled and bind them to gyder /
in such wise that with great pain they may be unbound /

How the deuylle tempts many one of the sin / where as he fyndeth them most
willing and ready to / Capitulo Cxxxv
aN Ensample I shall reherce unto you of a great lady / which was lady to a
Baron / This lady was long time in thestate of wedowhede / and had but a
daughter / which was wedded to a great lord / She then be came seek / and
lay in her dedely bed / and made the cheste where as her tresoure was in to
be sealed / and the keye to be brought unto her which she put in a lynen
clothe under her bak The death ran fast upon her / and she which had ever
thout to her tresour / lift up her hand making sign or token / that none
should approach ne come to her back / And thus she did still / tylle that she
deyde and rendryd her soul out of her body / Then came the daughter which
was a great lady / and demanded of them that were at her death / if she had any
tresour / They ansuerd that they knew of none / but thought that she had some
/ And that if she had any / it was hyd somwher about her bed / They tol^d to
her the manner of her mother and how she would not suffer that any body should come
by her / and also how s^he maade a cheste to be sealed / and the keye of hit
brought to her / which keye she kept ever under her back / The corpse was
meued and turned / and the keye found / And then her daughter went in to a
Tower where as the Chyste was / and opened hit / wherein she fond as well in
coin as in plate more than thyrtty thousand pound / but the gold was found in
cloutis and ballys of threde and of wulle. and in other things / whereof all
they that knew and saw the manner of it were merueylled and abashed / The
daughter then made a Cross / and said / that in good feythe she held her not
so rich by the xxv part as she was / wherefore she merueylled much and was
sore abashed / And yet she said / how of late she and her lord also came to her
/ and prayed her to help and lene to them some of her good till a certain time
that they should render it and pay it her again / And that she swear and made
great oaths to them that she had no money ne no silver / but such plate as
they saw abroad / that was a c^up and a pyece only / And therefore was she
much merueylled to find there so great a tresour / Then said the folk
which were with her / Madame be not ye merueylled / for we ben thereof more
merueylled than you / For if she would send on a message / or else as she had some
other thing to do / she borrowed some money of our servants / and said that
she had no money by her feythe / The daughter took all this good with her /
and went her way toward her lord / to whom she was welcome And of all this
tresour was never given a halfpeny for the soul of their mother / but soon
they forgate her / For it is not yet long time gone that I was where as she
was buried / and demanded and asked of the Monks of the Abbeye / where she
lay / and why she had no tomb on her / or some token of her / And they ansuerd
to me that syn she was entered there / no mass ne no seruyse at all / ne none
other good there had be done for her / By this ensample may ye know how the
deuylle is subtle to tempte the folk of the sin where he sees them most
entatched / and so fast he holds them in it / that they may not leave it /
without to be thereof Co^fessyd / and makes them his servants as he did the
foresaid lady / For he did so much that she wa^s subgette and servant to her
gold / in such wise that she durst not take of hit to do her any good / And
therefore my fair daughters here is a good ensample / that if it befelle that
god of his grace send you any great good that ye depart largely of hit to the
pour folk in the worship of god and for the love of him / And specially to
your pour parents and neighbors / and leave it not to be departed by the
hands of your heirs / as did this lady / for whom after her death was
never mass ne none other good done for her as ye have herd to fore /

Thexample of a good wydowe / Capitulo Cxxxvj
aNother Ensample I will tell you contrary to this It is of a good lady /
which long time was in wydowhede / She was of a holy life / and much humble
and honorable / as she which every year kept and held a Fest^ upon
Crystemasse day of her neighbors both far and nere ty^l her halle was full
of them / She served and honored each one after his degree / And specially she
bare great reverence to the good and true wymmen / and to them / which had
deseruyd to be worshipped / Also she was of such customme / that if she knew
any pour gentle woman / that should be wedded / She arrayed her with her Jewels
/ Also she went to the obsequye of the pour gentle wymmen / and gaf there
torches and all such other lumynary as it neded thereto / Her daily ordenaunce
was that she rose erly enough. / and had ever Freres and two or three
chappellayns which said matyns before her within her oratorye / And after she
herd a hyhe mass and two low / And said her seruyse full deuoutely / And
after this she went and arrayed her self / and walked in her gardyn or else
about her place saying her other deuocions and prayers / And as time was she
went to dinner / And after dinner if she wyste and knew any seek folk or
wymmen in their childbedde she went to see and vysyted them / and made to be
brout to them of her best mete / And there as she myt not go her self / she had
a servant propyce therefore / which rode upon a little horse / and bare with
him great plente of good mete and drink for to give to the pour and seek
folk there as they were / And after she had herd euensonge / she went to her
s^uper if she fasted not / And tymely she went to bed / And made her styward
to come to her to wete what mete should be had the next day / and lived by
good ordenaunce / and would be purueyed before of all such thing that was
needful for her household / She made great abstynence / and wered the hair
upon the wednesday and upon the friday / And hou I know this I shall tell it
to you / This good lady dyed in a Manoyr which she held in dowaye / the which
was apperteynynge to my lord my fader / And I and my susters which were but
young of age came to duelle there / And the bed whereon this good lady deyd was
broken in pyeces / and under the straw was found a hayr / which a damoysell
took And said to us that it was the hayr of her lady / And that she wered it
two or three days in the weke / And also told / and reherced to us her good
condycions and her good life / And how she Rose every night three times / and
kneled down to the ground by her bed / and rendryd thankynges to god / and
prayed for all Christian sowles / And how she did great alms to the poures / This
good lady that well is wor^^y to be named and preysed / had to name My lady
Cecyle of balleuylle / And yet I have herd say that her brother might spend
yearly xviijM pound / but notwithstondynge that / she was the most humble and
the most good and curtoys lady / that ever I knew or wyste in any country /
and that less was enuyous and never she would here say any evil of no body /
but excused them and prayed to god / that they myt amend them / and that none
was that knew what to him should hap / And thus she blamed them that spoke
euylle of other folk And maade them abashed of that she repreued them so as
she did / And thus ought to do every good woman / and every good man at
thexample of this good lady / And know ye that hit is a noble virtue not to be
enuyous / And not to be Ioyeful of the dommage or scathe of other / And for
certain this good lady said / that they which auaunced them of the euylle and
dommage of other / and that mocked their neighbors and other / And that god
should punysshe them or so^e of their nyghe friends and parents / whereof came
to them great shame / And that have I seen often befalle / as the good lady said
/ For none ought not to Judge ne reproach the damage or euylle of other / Many
such fair and prouffytable talkyng of this good lady is in my memory /
Notwithstondyng the young age which I was of when she deyde / For I was not
above ten year old / She had a right noble end / and as I wene right agreeable
to god / And as men say communely of honest and good life comes ever a good end

The three enseygnementes or lernynges which Cathon gaf to his sone / Capitulo
Cxxxvij
aNother ensample I will tell you of the wise Cathon by whose wisdom was all
the Cite of Rome governed / He made and wrote many fair auctorytees / the
which yet as now make great memore of him / This Cathon had a sone / and as he
was in the bed of his death / he called his sone to him / the which had to
name Cathonet / and said to him Fair sone I have long lived in this world /
which is much hard to know / and much merueyllous / and alwey shall wexe
wors as I trow / wherefore I would and desire much that your government and
manner of living should be good to the worship of you and of all your friends /
I have take therefore to you by writing many enseygnementes / the which shall
prouffyte to you herafter / if ye thereto will set your heart and have them
in your memory / Nevertheless I have bethought in my self to tell and give
you other three / er I deye / wherefore I pray you that ever ye will have them
in your memory

The First enseygnement / Capitulo Cxxxviij
tHe first enseygnement of the three / is this / that ye take none office of
your sovereign lord / if so be that ye have good enough and good suffysaunte
after as your estate ought to have / and no more ye ought to ask of God / And
therefore ye ought not put your self in subjection to lose your good by sum
evil word or by sum evil report / For certainly my fair sone there be
lords of diverse condycions and manners / Sum ben hasty / and that lyghtely
bileue And sum have other manners of condycion / And therefore men ought to
have suffysaunce and be doubting to put him self / his estate / and worship in
parylle and in the danger of folk which ben light of will / The second
enseygnement is that ye respyte no man that has deseruyd to deye / and
specially if he be custommed to do euylle / For if ye so did ye should be
participant in all the euylle that he afterward should do as right were

The third enseygnement Capitulo xxxix
He third Enseygnement is / that ye preue and essaye your wife to wete and know
if she shall keep secretly your counceylle / which parauenture might be
cause of your death / For there ben sum which ben much wise / and that can
well keep secretly what that someuer men sayen to them / and the which also
give good counceylle and aduysement / And sum ben that can never keep their
tongue / but tell all that is said to them / as well ageynste them / as for
them / And thus the wise Cathon gaf this three enseygnementes to his sone / as
he lay seek at the point of his death / This true and wise man Cathon deyde
and his sone abode on live / which was hold sage and wise / In so much / that
the emperor of Rome took him his sone for to endoctryne and teache him / And
afterward he maade some lords to speak to him for to withold him to govern
and set in good rewle / ^he great fayttes and materes of Rome / and promised
him to have thereby great auaylles and prouffytees / where for and by the
couetyse of these prouffytees / he consented to t^ke thoffyce / and took on him
the charge of it / and forgate thenseygnement and techynge of his fader / And
after when he was stablysshed and received in his office / he rode on a day
thorugh the high street with great company of folk / which followed him / He
saw a thief which men conveyed to the galhows for to be hanged / which was
much young / Then said one to Cathon which stood by him / Sire by cause of
the nouellyte of your office / ye may well respyte and keep this man fro death /
And he without enquest by him made of the caas why he was Iuged to receive
death / made him to be unbound / and by cause of the nouellyte of his office he
kept the thief fro death / He was to hasty / For at that time he thout not on
the commandment that his fader had made unto him

How Cathon after he had done against the two commandments essayed the third
on his wife capitulo Cxl
aS the night was come / And that Cathon had slept his first sleep / he had
many vysyons upon this matere / in so much that he remembryd how he had broken
and done against two of the commandments of his fader And seeing this he
thought that he would not break ne do against the third / wherefore he went to
his wife / and said thus to her / My good friend and my wife / I would tell you a
great counceylle / which touches my person / and might be the cause of my
death / if I wist that ye should keep it secretly Ha a my lord said she / on my
feythe / I had lever be deed / than to discouere to any body your counceylle
/ Ha a my friend then shall ye know hit said he / Troth it is / that
the emperor took to me his sone / as ye well know for to learn / and teache him /
but certainly / hit is not long time gone / for sum words which he said to
me / that I as a dronken man and as he that was wroth of other thing hastily
took the Child and slew him / and more I did / for I took and arrached out
of his belly his heart / the which I made to be confyte in sugre and other
spyces / and sent it to the emperor his fader / and to his mother / And they ete
hit / And thus I avenged me of him / but I know well now that it is an evil
and abhomynable deed done / whereof I me repent / but it is to late / Therefore
my good Friend and my wife / I pray you as affectuelly as I can / that ye keep
this counceyll secret withyn your heart as I trust me to you / But the morrow
after / she began to weep and maake great sorrow / And a woman which was
with her demanded of her / Madame what have ye that ye make such sorrow /
Have ye any heaviness within your heart / Verily said she then / ye my Friend
/ and that a great / but rather I should deye / er it should be known / Ha a
madame / she were well out of her wit that should tell and dyscouere such^ a
counceylle if ye had said hit / And as for me rather I should let me draw /
than I should tell it ageyn Ye said the wife of Cathonet / may I trust in you
/ Ye by feyth says the other woman / She took her feythe and her oath And
then to her she told and discovered her secret / how her lord had slain
themperours sone / and his heart confyted in spyces had sent to the emperor his
fader and to his mother / and how they had ete of hit / This woman maade a
Cross as she were sore merueylled / and said that she should keep hit secretly
/ But certainly her taryenge there after that she knew hit / thought her long
for to have go and tell it to other / For as soon as she was departed fro
Cathons hows / she went forthwith where themperours wife was / and came and
kneled before her / and said Madame to your good grace I will speak secretly
of a great counceylle / And then themperesse commanded her ladies to go a
part / And the said woman began thus to speak / Madame the great love which
I bear unto you / and for the great good that ye have done to me And as I
trust that ye yet will do / makes me to come hyder for to tell you a great
counceylle / the which I would not tell but to your person / For I might not
suffix ne see your dishonor for none erthely good / Madame it is so / that ye
love and have dear Cathonet more than any other / as it appyereth well / For ye
have made him governor of the Cite of Rome / And ye showed him gretter love
when ye gaf to him the keeping of your sone / to whom he has hold such
felauship that he has slain him / And has take his heart out of his belly /
And well dressyd and confyted in sugre and spyces and has made you to ete it /
What say ye said themperours wife / Madame said she / I tell you true for
certain For I know this by the mouth of Cathonets wife / which sorrowful and
weeping told it to me in great counceylle / And when themperesse herd her to
speak / she with a high voys began to cry / and made such a sorrow that it
was pity to see In so much that the tidings came to the emperor / how the
Emperesse made so great sorrow / The Emperor was sore abashed And came there as
themperesse was / and demanded of her / why she maade such sorrow / And she
with high pleynt ansuerd and reherced to him all that the damoysell had told
her of their sone / And when the emperor wist that they had eten the heart of
their child / he bicame right anger / and sorrowful And commanded that
Cathonet should forthwith be t^ke and hanged in the mids of Rome / there as
the folk might look on him as upon a falls murderer and traitor / His
Sergeaunts went and took him anon / and told him the commandment of
the emperor / and that it was for his sone / which he had slain / Cathonet
then said to them / It is no need that all that men sayn be truth / ye
shall put me in prison / and shall say / that it is to late to make any
execucion of Iustyse / And that to morrow I shall be hanged before the people /
The Sergeaunts loved him much and so did all manner of folk / they did as
he badde them to do / And then went and said to the Emperor and
themperesse that hit were for the best to make Iustyse of him on the morrow
next coming / and that her was to late / and how more people should then be
gadered and assembled for to see him And the Emperor which made great sorrow
for his sone granted hit /

And not withstondyne this / in the mean while that Cathonet was conveyed to
prison / he called to him a Squire of his / And said to him / goo to such a
knight that keeps themperours sone / and tell him how the Emperor weneth
that I have put him to death / And that he faylle not to be here to morrow with
him before the hour of pryme / or else I shall be in great peril to receive
a shameful death / This Squire departed and so fast rode and waloped / that
that night he came about one of the cloak after mydnyght there as Cathonet
had take to keep the sone of the Emperor as to his true and good Friend /
which was a true man / and much wise / And merueyllously they loved each
other / The Squyr began to call with an high voys / And did so much /
that he came to fore the bed there as the true and noble Baron lay / And
told him / how sum had done byle^e to the Emperor / that Cathone^ had
slain his sone / And how hit was ordained / that he should be on that next
morrow hanged /

And as the Baron herd this / he was sore abashed / and much merueylled of
this adventure / and forthwith he rose out of his bed / and made his men to
be ready / and came to the bed where the sone of the emperor lay / and told to
him the merueyll And when the child understood it he had great sorrow in his
heart / For ouermoche he loved Cathonet his maystre / Here I leave to speak of
the Baron / and of themperours sone / and turn again to speak of Cathonet
which was in prison /

How they would hang Cathonet / Capitulo Cxli
cAthonet was merueyllously loved in Rome of al manner of folk / as he that was
wise / humble / true and curtoys / And when the morrow was come / he said to
one his great friend / that at all adventure he should make the hangmen of the
town to hyde them self secretly somwher ty^l it were about the hour of
tierce / And he did as he had prayed him to do / Cathonet then about the
hour of pryme was conveyed to the galhows of all the people of Rome / which
made great sorrow for him / And yet gretter sorrow had they made / but they
wened verily that he had done the deed / of which he was accused / whereof they
had great merueylle / And said emonge them how may such a wise man have be so
sore tem^ted of the deuylle / that he has slain themperours sone / how may
this be / Of this faytte was great talking among the^ Sum byleued hit / And
sum said it was not so ^ Nevertheless he was had to the galhows / and was
asked after (...) hang man / but he could not be found there / whereof hit
befelle a great merueylle / for he which Cathonet had respyted and saved fro
death / as men led him to be hanged / came forth and said ^ Lords the deed is
foul / dishonest / and vylaynous / and for the love of the emperor I offer my
self to do thoffyce / if there be none other that will do hit / Every man
looked then on him and said / Is not that he / to whom Cathonet granted his
life when he was new put in thoffyce of governor / Certainly said the
other / hit is he and none other / without fawte / wherefore in token and sign
of a great me^ueyll / they blessed them with their hands. saying / He is well a
fool that saves and respyteth any thief fro the galhows / Cathon then looked
on him / and said / thou art well passing ready / Remembryst not thou the time
passed / but thus gone the merueylles of the world / And as soon as he had
said these words there was a great nombre of men al on horsback which made
great clamor and cried / put not to death the true man Cathonet

How themperours sone came to save his master Cathonet and of his escape
Capitulo Cxlij
aNd when the people perceived / and saw the horses rennynge toward them / and
saw anon the sone of the emperor / which cried / touch not / neither ley
hand on my masters body / for I am alive / they were gretely merueylled / The
child anon light of his horse and went and vnbonde his master / and sore
weeping kyssed him full tendirly and said Ha a my sweet friend and master who
has this purchaced and so great a lesyng found and contryued upon you / the
which my lord my fader has so lyghtely byleued / And then he embraced and
kyssed him again / and all the people which was gretely merueylled / as they
saw the pity and good nature of the child thanked and mercyed god with all
their hertes of the delyuerau^ce of Cathonet / The child made his master to be
set on horsbak and led him through the streets of Rome by the raynes of his
brydell till they came in to the palais where the emperor his fader was / And
when the emperor and his wife knew for certain the coming of their sone /
they went and met him with great Joy / And as they saw him ledynge his
master Cathonet by the raynes / they were gretely merueylled / and held them
ashamed and vergoynous toward Cathonet / and came to him / and each of them
kyssed him / and made to him the grettest joy and chere and the grettest
honor that they couthe / And excused them toward him of this deed / Then
said the child to his fader the emperor / Ha my lord will ye use of so hasty
Justice without making of none enqueste upon the deed or faytte / For a man
of so high estate as ye be should and out to be more blamed therefore / than
another of lower degree or estate / For ye had maade him to be dampened and
destroyed without cause it had be great pity and great dommage / And certainly
never after I should have had Joy in my heart / For if I can any good / it
comes of him / The Emperor ansuerd / Fair sone hit was euylle done of us / and
in this we have gretely offended and get shame / but the love that we have in
the / and the trust that we have in thyn preferrement / took reason fro us /
and bestourned our wit / Then spoke Cathonet and said to the emperor / Sire
merueylle you not of this thing / I shall now tell unto you / why all this
was said / My fader which in his time was a right wise man and a true / and
borne in this land showed to me many good enseygnementes / if I had be so Wise
/ to have had them ever stylle in memory / And yet as he was (...) his bed /
and nyghe at his last end / he called me to (...) he which much desired that
I might learn and know (...) good / and prayed me that I would well keep in my
(...) three enseygnements / emonge al other that he before that (...) taught to
me / the which I will now record and (...) them / to the end that they may be
ensample in time to come to every man / as to him / to whom they have happed /
and (...) done the contrary /

How Cathonet told the emperor of the lore of his fader and of his escape
Capitulo Cx^^^^
He first enseygnement that he taught me / was (...) that if ever god gaf me
chance and good enough that I should thank him much of hit / and have (...)
me suffysaunce / and not coueyte ne ask more of god / And by cause I should
have suffysaunce / he commanded and changed me / that never I should put my
self in subjection of none office under my sovereign lord / For if I did so by
coue^yse of more good / sum enuyous by sum falls repporte should make me to
lose my good and my self also / And that hit was a peryllous thing to serve
any prince or great lord of light and hasty will / For many one there ben /
which enquereth them not if the repporte to them made is true or not wherefore
the commandments of such hasty lords ben strange and peryllous / as ye now
have seen how this ensample is to me which al^ most has be shamefulle and
greuable / And if I had byleuyd the counceyll of my fader / I had never fall
in such peril / For thanked be god I had of erthely goods enough / and more
than I have deseruyd to god / and might well have deported my self of taking of
thoffyce / The second enseygnement was that I never should respyte ne save to no
man his life / which had deserved to deye / and in especial a thief or an
homycyde / which were custommed to theftes and murdre of folk / And that if I
did / I should ever be partener of all such euylle deeds that they might do
afterward / And this commandment I have enfrayned and broken / For this day
have I seen him which I have respyted him fro the shamefulle death / that
offered and presented him self for to be the hangman of my body / little reward
he offered to me / The third enseygnement was that I should essaye my wife or ever
I should discouere to her any great counceylle / For therein is to great paryll /
Nevertheless there ben some that can well keep secretly what men say to them /
and in the which men find good counceylle and comfort / And other also which
that can no thing keep in secret / And then as I me bethought how I had
broken and done against the ij enseygnementes of my fader / I thought and said
in my self that I should preue and essaye the third / wherefore that other day
as I was a bed with my wife I awaked her / and for to essaye her will / I
said to her that I had slain the sone of the emperor / and that his heart
confyted in spyeces I had made the emperor and his wife to ete hit / And that for
the love of which she loved me / she should keep this in secret / so that
none might never know no thing of hit / Now have I proved and essayed how she
has kept secretly my counceylle as every one may now see and know / But I
give me not to great merueylle thereof / For hit is not of new how that a woman
can not keep secretly that which men say^n to her in counceylle /

How Cathonet exposed his adventure or hap / Capitulo xliiij
nOw have ye herd how it is happed to me / by cause I did not believe the
counceylle of my Fader / which was so true and wise a man / To me therefore is
come almost a great euylle / And notwithstondynge thus said Cathonet to
the emperor / Sire I render and discharge me of your office / And from hensforth
I shall not be en^eched of hit / And he thereof was discharged with great pain
^ Neue^^theles he was received for to be master of the great (...) of Rome /
And in especial of the great fayttes and deeds ^ And the emperor made him to
have great prouffitees / and (...) him great yeftes / and loved him above al
other / And (...) much holyly in the love of god and of the people / (...)
therefore my fair daughters this is here a good ensam^^^^ how ye ought to keep
the counceyll of your lord / and not (...) it to no body what someuer it be /
For often comen thereof (...) euyls / and for to be secret / and specially in
such thing (...) is deffended / may not come sauf only good / And in like
(...) as the shafte is departed fro the bow must take her flyg^^ and course /
and never comes again to the bow / till it hau^ smite sum thing / So is
the word which issued out of the mouth like it / For after that he is put
out of the mou^^ it may never be put in to the mouth again / but that it shall
be herd be it good or euylle / wherefore we ought well to have (...) our memory
the saynges and auctorytees of the wise S^lamon / which says that men must
think on the words twyes or thryes or they be putt out of the mouth / And
thus ought to do al wise folk / For over many great euyls have been done and
engendered for to have discovered the counceyll and such things as have been
said there in counceylle / Therefore I pray you fair daughters that ye will
have this ensample in your memory and never forgete it / For all good and
worship may thereof come to you / And her is a virtue the which escheweth great
hate and great envy and many euyls also / For many one I know which have
lost much of their goods / and suffered many great euyls for to have spoke to
lyghtely of other / and for to have reported such words as they herd say /
of the which they had naught to do at al For none so wise is that may know
what to him is to come / And full of naturel wit be they / which keep them
self fro recordynge of any words / For he which wythsayeth them that blames
other as well in right as in wrong / he does but well / And for to hold and keep
secretly the dommage and euylle of other may come but good / as hit is
reherced in the book of my two sons And also in an Euangely
