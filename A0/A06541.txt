Here ends the Interpretacy on of the names of Goddys and Goddesses as is
rehearsed in the tretyse following as poets write.
When Phoebus in the crabbe had nere his course run
And toward the Leon his Journey began take
To look on Pyctagoras spear I had bgonne
Syttyng all solytary allone beside a lake
Musyng on a maneer how that I might make
Reason and sensualyte in one to accord
But I could not bring about that monacorde
For long er I might sleep me began oppress
So ponderously I could make none obstacle
In mine head was fall such an heaviness
I was feign to draw to mine habytacle
To rowne with a pylow me semyd best tryacle
So leyde I me down my dyssease to releue
Anon came in Morpleus and took me by the sleue
And as I so lay half in a traunse
Twene slepyng and wakyng he bad me arise
For he said I must give attendaunce
To the great Court of Mynos the Iustyse
Me naught auayled ayene him to sylogyse
For hit is often said by hem that yet lives
He must needs go that the deuell dryues
When I see no better* but I must go
I said I was ready at his commandment
wheder that he would me led to or fro
So up I arose and forth with him went
Till he had me brought to the parlyament
where Pluto sat and kept his estate
And with him Mynos the Judge desperate
But as we thyderwarde went by the way
I him besought his name me to tell
Morpleus he said thou me call may
A sir said I than where do ye dwell
In heaven or to earth either else in hell
Nay he said mine abydyng most commonly
Is in a little corner called fantasy
And as soon as he these words had said
Cerberus the porter of hell with his cheyne
Brought theder Colus in rags evil arayd
Again whom Neptunus and Dyana did co^pleyne
Saying thus O Mynos thou Judge souereyne
Give thy cruel Judgment again this traitor so
That we may have cause to preyse thy lord Pluto
Then was there made a proclamacyon
In Plutoos name commanded silence
Upon the pain of strayte correccyon
That Dyana and Neptunus might have audyence
To declare her greef of the great offense
To them do by Colus whereon they co^pleyned
And to begin Dyana was constreyned
which thus began as ye shall here
Saying in this wise. O thou lord Pluto
with thy Inge Mynos syttyng with the in fere
Execute your fury upon Colus so
According to the offense that he to me has do
That I have no cause forther to apele
which if I do shall not be for your well
Remember first how I a goddess pure
Over all deserts. forestes and chaces
Have take the guydyng and under my cure
This traitor Colus has many of my places
Destroyed with his blastes and daily me manaces
where any wood is he shall make it pleyne
If he to his lyberte may resort again
The gretest trees that any man may find
In forest to shade the dear for her comfort
He breketh he^ asondre or rendeth he^ rote and rynde
Out of the earth this is his dysport
So that the dear shall have no resort
within short time to no manner shade
where thorugh the game is lykly to fade
which to mine name a reproach synguler
Should be for ever while the world last
And to all the goddis an high dyspleser
To see the game so dystroyed by his blast
wherefore a remedy puruey in have
And let him be punysshed after his offense
Consider the crime. and give your sentence
And when thus Dyana had made her co^pleynt
To Mynos the Judge in Plutoos presence
Came forth Neptunus with vysage pale and feyne
Desyryng of favor to have audyence
Saying thus Pluto to thy magnyfycence
I shall rehearse what this creature
Colus has done me out of mesure
Thou know well that I have the charge
Over all the sea. and thereof god I am
No ship may sail. keruell boot nor barge
Great karyke. nor hulke with any living man
But if he have my save conduyte than
who me offends within my Iurysdiccyon
O weth to submyt him to my correccyon
But in asmekyll as hit is now so
That ye him here have as your prysonere
I shall you show. my compleynt loo
wherefore I pray you that ye will hit here
And let him not escape out of your daungere
Till he have made full seethe and recompense
For hurt of my name through this great offense
First to begin. this Colus has often
Made me to return my course again nature
with his great blastys when he has be a lofte
And charged me to labor far out of mesure
That it was great marvel how I might endure
The com of my sweet will it testyfye
That on the sea banks lythe beten full hye
Secondly where as my nature is
Both to ebb and flow and so my course to keep
Often of mine entente has he made me mys
where as I should have filled dykes deep
At a full water I might not theder crepe
Before my season came to return again
And than went I faster than I would certain
Thus he has me driven again mine intent
And contrary to my course natural
where I should have be he made me be absent
To my great dyshonoure and in especyall
Do thing he used that worst was of all
For where as I my sauegarde granted
Ay in that cost he commonly haunted
Of verrey pure malice and of sylfe will
Them to dystroye in dyspyte of me
To whom I promised both in good and ill
To be her protector in all aduersyte
That to them should fall upon the sea
And even suddenly er they could beware
with a sodeyn pyry he lapped hem in care
And full often sith with his boystous blast
Er they might be ware. he drofe hy^ on ye sand
And otherwhyle he brake toop seyle and mast
which caused they^ to perysshe er they came to la^ de
Then cursed they ye time yt ever they me fa^de
Thus among the people lost is mine name
And so by his labor put I am to shame
Consider this matter and ponder my cause
Tender my compleynt as rygour requires
Show forth your sentence with a breef clause
I may not long tarry the time fast expyreth
The offense is great wherefore hit desires
The more grievous pain and hasty Judgment
For offense done wylfully will none auysement
And wha^ ye god Pluto a while had hy^ be thought
He rowned w^ Mynos to know what was to do
Then he said openly look thou fail naught
Thy sentence to give without favor so
Like as thou have herd the causes meuyd the to
And so euenly dele twene these parties tweyn
That none of hem have case on ye other co^pleyn
Then said Mynos full Indyfferently
To Dyana and Neptunus. is there any more
That ye will declare again him openly
Nay in deed they said we keep none in store
we have said enough to punysshe him fore
If ye in this matter be not parcyall
Remember your name was wont to be egall
well than said Mynos now let us here
what this boystous Colus for himself can say
For here Prima facie. to us does apere
That he has offended no man can say nay
wherefore thou Colus without more delay
Shape us an answer to thine accusement
And else I must proceed upon thy Judgment
And even as Colus was on ward to have said
For his excuse. came in a messengere
Fro god Apollo. to Pluto and him prayed
On his behalf that he without daungere
would to him come and bring with him in fere
Dyana and Neptunus unto his banquet
And if they dysdeyned himself he would he^ f^^
Moreover he said to the god Apollo
Desired to have respyte of the Judgment
Of Colus both of Mynos and Pluto
So Dyana and Neptunus were therewith content
And if they were dysposed to assent
That he might come unto his presence
He hit desired to know his offense
what sey ye herto said Pluto to hem tweyn
will ye both assente that hit shall be thus
ye said the goddess for my part certain
And I also said this Neptunus
I am well pleased quod this Colus
And when they had a while thus together spoke
Pluto commanded the court to be broke
And than togeder went they in fere
Pluto and Neptunus ledyng the goddess
whom followed Cerberus with his prysonere
And alder last with great heaviness
Came I and Morpleus to the forteresse
Of the god Appollo unto his banquet
where many goddys and goddesses met
when Apollo see that they were come
He was right glad and prayed hem to sit
Nay said Dyana this is all and some
ye shall me pardone I shall not sit yet
I shall first know why Colus abyte
And what execucyon shall on him be do
For his offense. well said Apollo
Madame ye shall have all your pleysere
Sith that hit will none otherwise be
But first I you pray let me the matter here
why he is brought in this perplexite
well said Pluto. that shall ye soon se
And began to declare even by and by
Both her complayntes ordynatly
And when Apollo had herd the report
Of Pluto in a manner smylyng he said
I see well Colus. thou haste small comfort
Thy self to excuse thou may be dysmayde
To here so great complayntis ayene the laid
That notwithstondyng if thou can sey ought
For thine one well. sey and tarry naught
Forsothe said Colus if I had respyte Nota

Her to an answer cowde I counterfete
But to have her grace more is my delight
wherefore I pray you all for me entrete
That I may by your request her good grace get
And what pain or greef ye for me provide
without any grutchyng I shall hit abide
Loo good Madame said god Apollo
what may he do more but sew to your grace
Behold how the teeres from his eyes go
Hit is satysfaccyon half for his trespace
Now glorious goddess show your pyteous face
To this poor prisoner at my request
All we for your honor think thus is best
And if hit like you to do in this wise
And to foryeue him clearly his offense
One thing suerly I will you promise
If he often rebelle and make resystence
Or dysobey unto your sentence
For every tree that he makes fall
Out of the earth. an hundred arise shall
So that your game shall not dyscrease
For lack of shade I dare undertake
well sir Apollo said she than will I cease
Of all my rancour and mercy with you make
And than god Neptunus of his matter spoke
Saying thus Apollo though Dyana him relese
Yet shall he sue to me to have his pese
A said Apollo ye wend I had foryete
you for my lady Dyana the goddess
Nay think not so. for I will you entrete
As well as her without long process
will ye agree that Phoebus your maystresse
May have the guydyng of your varyaunce
I shall abide quod he. her ordinance
well than quod Apollo. I pray you goddis all Nota

And goddesses eke that be here present
That ye companably will a boorde fall
Nay than said Othea. hit is not conuenyent
A dew order in every place is expedyent
To be had wherefore ye may not let
To be your own marchall at your own ba^ket
And when Apollo see hit would none other be
He called to him Aurora the goddess
And said though ye weep yet shall ye before me
Ay keep your course and put your self in press
So he her set first at his own mess
with her moist clothes with teres all be spreynt
The medewes in may show thereof her co^pleynt
Next her sat Mars mighty god and strong
with a flamme of fire enuyrounde all about
A crown of iron on his head a spear in his ho^de
Hit semyd by his chere as he would have fought
And next unto him as I perceue might
Sat the goddess Dyana in a mantell fine
Of black sylke purfyly with poudryd hermyne
Like as he had take the mantell and the ryng*
And next unto her arrayed royally
Sat the god Iupyter in his demenyng
Full sad and wise he seemed sykerly
A crown of tynne stood on his head
And that I record of all phylosophres
That little store of Coin keep in her cofres
Ioynes to him in syttyng next there was
The goddess Juno full rychely beseene
In a sercote that shone as bright as glass
Of goldsmytthes work with spa^gles wrought be dene
Of royal richesse wa^ted she none I wene
And next by her sat the god Saturn
That often sithe causes many one to morn
But he was clad. me thought straungely
For of frost and snow was all his array
In his hand he held a fawchon all blody
Hit semyd by his chere as he would make a fray
A bawdryk of Isykles about his neck gay
He had. and above an high on his head
Couchyd with hayle stones he wered a crown of led
And next in order was set by his side
Ceres the goddess in a garmente
Of sack clothe made with sleues large and wide
Embrowdered with sheues and sykelys bente
Of all manner greynes she sealyd the patente
In token that she was the goddess of corn
Old Poets say she bears the heruest horn
Then was there set the god Cupydo
All fresshe and galaunt and costly in array
with ouches and rings he was beset so
The paleys thereof shone as though bit had be day
A kerchyfe of plesau^ce stood over his helm ay
The goddess Ceres he looked in the face
And with one arm he her did enbrace
Next to C^^^do in order by and by
Of worldly wisdom sat the forteresse
Called Othea chref ground of polycy
Rewler of knyghthode of prudence the goddess
Clad all in purpure was she more and less
Saaf on her head a crown there stood
Cowchyd with perles oryent fine and good
And next to her was god Pluto set
with a derke mist enuyronde all about
His clothyng was made of a smoky net
His color was both within and without
Foul derke and dymme his eyes great and stout
Of fire and sulphur all his odor wase
That woe was me while I beheld his face
Fortune the goddess with her party face
was unto Pluto next in order set
Varyaunt she was ay in short space
Her whele was ready to turn without let
Her gown was of gaudy grene chamelet
Chaungeable of sundry diverse colors
To the condycyons according of her shoures
And by her sat though he unworthy were
The rewde god Pan of sheperdys the gyde
Clad in russet frcse and breched like a bear
with a great tarboxe hangyng by his side
A shepecrook in his ho^de he spared for no pride
And at his feet lay a prykeryd curre
He rateled in the throat as he had the murre
Isys the goddess bare him company
For at the table next she sat by his side
In a close kyrtell enbrowdered curyously
with branches and leaves brood large and wide
Grene as any grass in the somer tide
Of all manner fruit she had the governance
Of savors odoryferous was her su^ynau^ce
Next her than was god Neptunus set
He sauored like a fyssher of him I spoke before
Hit seemed by his clothes as they had be wet
About hy^ in his gyrdelstede hyng fysshes many a score
Of his strange array merueyled I sore
A ship with a top and sail was his crest
Me thought he was gayly dysgysed at that fest
Than took Mynerue the goddess her sete
Jointly to Neptunus all in curas clad
Gau^clettis on her ho^dis and sabatou^s on her fete
She looked ever about as though she had be mad
An hamer and a sithe on her head she had
She wered two bokelers one by her side
That other ye wot were this was all her pride
Than came the god Bachus and by her set hy^ down
Holdyng in his hand a cup full of wine
Of grene vine leaves he wered a Ioly crown
He was clad in clustres of grapes good and fine
A garland of yuy he chose for his sign
On his head he had. a thredebare kendall hood
A gymlot and a fauset thereupon stood
Next him sat Phoebus with her color pale
Fat she was of face but of complexion feynt
She said she reuled Neptunus and made hy^ to auale
And ones in ye month with Phoebus was she meynt
Also ne were she. Ceres were ateynt
Thus she sat and told the might of her nature
And on her head she wered a crown of silver pure
Jointly to her Marcuryus took his see
As came to his course witness the zodyake
He had a gylden tongue as fill for his degree
In eloquence of langage he passed all the pake
For in his talkyng noman could find lake
A box with quyksyluer he had in his hand
Multyplyers know hit well in every land
By him sat dam Venus with color crystallyne
whoos long here shone as wyre of gold bright
Cryspe was her skyne her eyes columbyne
Rauysshed mine heart her chere was so light
Patroness of pleasau^ce be named well se might
A smock was her wede garnysshed curyously
But above all other she had a wanton ey
On her head she wered a read coper crown
A nosegay she had made full pleasauntly
Between her and Aurora. Apollo set him down
with his beams bright he shone so fervently
That he therewith gladyd all the company
A crown of pure gold was on his head set
In sign yt he was master and lord of yt banquet
Thus was the table set round about Nota

with goddis and goddesses as I have you told
Awaytyng on the boorde was a great route
Of sage philosophers and poets many fold
There was sad Sychero and Arystotyll old
Tholome Dorothe with Dyogenes
Plato Messehala and wise Socrates
Sorts and Saphyrus with hermes stood behy^de
Auycen and Autroys with hem were in fere
Galyen and Ypocras that physyk have in mind
with help of Esculapyon toward he^ drow nere
Virgyle Orace Ouyd and Omere
Euclyde and Alberte yaue her attendaunce
To do the goddys and goddesses pleasaunce
Whore berded Orpheus was there with his harp
And as a poet musykall made he melody
Other my^stral had they non safe Pan ga^ to carpe
Of his lewd bagpyp^ which causid yt company
To law yet many mother were if I should notly
Some young some old both better and werse
But mo of her names can I not rehearse
Of all manner deyntees there was habundau^ce
Of metys and drynkes foyson plenteuous
In came Dyscorde to have made varyau^ce
But there was no rome to set her in that house
The goddys remembered the scysme odyous
Among the three goddesses yt he had wrought
At the fest of Peleus wherefore they thought
They would not with her dele in adventure
Lest she them brought to some inconuenyent
She seeing this was wroth out of mesure
And in yt great wrath out of the paleys went
Saying to her self yt chere should they repent
And anon with Attropos happed she to mete
As he had been a ghost came in wyndyng shete
She took hy^ by the hand and rowned in his ear
And told him of the banquet yt was so delycate
How she was received and what chere she had there
And how every god sat in his estate
Is it thus quoth Attropos what in ye deuyllis date
well he said I see well how the game gothe
Ones yet for your sake shall I make he^ wroth
And when she had him all together told
From her he departed and of her took his leave
Saying yt for her sake his way take he would
In to the paleys his matters to meue
And er he thens went he trowed hem to grieve
with such tidings as he should hem tell
So forth in he went and spoke words fell
when he came in the presence of the goddys all
As he had be wood he looked him about
His shete from his body down he let fall
And on a rewde manner he saluted all the route
with a bold voys carpyng words stout
But he spoke all holow as hit had be one
Had spoke in a another world yt had woe begone
He stood forth boldly with grym contenaunce
Saying on this wise as ye shall here
All ye great goddys give attendaunce
Unto my words without all daungere
Remember how ye made me your offycere
All tho with my dart finally to chastyse
That you dysobeyed or would your law dispyse
And for the more suerte ye sealed my patent
Gyuyng me full power so to occupy
whereto I have enployed mine intent
And that can dame Nature well testyfy
If she be examyned she will hit not deny
For when she forsakes any creature
I am ay ready to take him to my cure
Thus have I deuly with all my dylygence
Executed the office of old antyquyte
To me by you granted by your common sentence
For I spared none high nor low degree
So that on my part no defaute has be
For as soon as any to me committed wase
I smote him to ye heart he had none other grase
Ector of Troy for all his chyualry
Alexander the great and mighty conqueror
Iulyus Caesar with all his company
Dauyd nor Iosue nor worthy Artour
Charles the noble that was so great of honor
Nor Judas Machabee for all his true heart
Nor Godfery of Boleyn could me not astert
Nabugodonozor for all his great pride
Nor the king of Egypt cruel Pharao
Jason ne Hercules went they never so wide
Cosdras Hanyball nor gentle Sypyo
Cyrus Achylles nor many a another mo
For teyre or foul gat of me no grace
But all be at ye last. I sesed hem with my mace
Thus hauy brought every creature
To an end both man fysshe foul and best
And every other thing in whom dame nature
Has any Iurysdyccyon either most or lest
Except oonly one in whom your beheste
Is to me broke for ye me promised
That my might of non should have be dispysed
whereof the cou^trary dare I well auowe
Is true for one there is that will not apply
Unto my correccyon nor in nowyse bow
To the dynt of my dart for dole nor desteny
what comfort he has nor the cause why
That he so rebelleth I can not think of right
But if ye have hy^ granted your alders safeco^dyghe
And if ye so have than do ye not as goddys
For a goddys writing may not reuersyd be
If it should I would not give two pesecoddys
For grant of your patent of office nere of fee
wherefore in this matter do me equytee
According to my patent. for till this be do
ye have no more my service nor my good will loo
And when all the goddys had Attropos hered
As they had be wood they brayde up attones
And said they would not rest till he were conquered
Taken and destroyed body blood and bones
And yt they swear great oaths for the nones
Her law to dyspyce that was so malapert
They said he should be taught for to be so pert
well said Apollo if he on earth be
with my brennyng chare I shall him confou^de
In feyth quod Neptunus and if he keep the sea
He may be full sure. he shall soon be drownde
A sir said Mars this have we well fownde
That any dysobeyed our godly precept
we may well think we have to long slept
But nevertheless where I may him find
with thu^dre and lyghtnyng about I shall hy^ chase
And I quod Saturnus before and behind
with my bitter cold shall show hy^ hard grase
well said Mercuryus if I may see his fase
For ever of his speech I shall him depryue
So that him were better be deed than a live
ye quod Othea yet may he well be
In the air where he will and axe you no leave
wherefore my counseyll is that all we
May entreat Neptunus his rancour to foryeue
And then I doubt not Colus will hy^ myscheue
So may ye be sure he shall you not escape
And else of all your anger will he make but aiape
But for to tell you how Colus was brought
In danger of Pluto yet had I forgete
wherefore on this matter forther will I naught
Proceed till I thereof have knowleche you let
Hit fell on a day the weder was wete
And Colus thought he would on his desporte
Goo to rejoice his spyrytes and comfort
He thought he would see what was in ye ground
And in a krauers forth he began him dress
A drowthe had the earth late before found
That caused it to chyne and krauy more and less
Suddenly by weet constrained by duresse
was the ground to close his superfycyall face
So strayte that to escape Colus had no space
This seeing Colus he still within abode
Sekyng where he might have gone out fer ornere
Anon he was alpyed and one to Plutorode
And told hy^ how Colus was in his dau^gere
Then said he to Cerberus fet me yt prysonere
Till I have him seen let him not go at large
As thou wylt answer of him I give the charge
Thus was this Colus take prisoner
Than happed hit so that the same day
Pluto had prefixed for a great matter
Mynos to sit in his roob of Ray
wherefore Cerberus took the next way
And led him to the place where the court shall be
wheder as I told you Morpleus brought me
So thither came Dyana carried in a carre
To make her compleynt as I told you all
And so did Neptunus yt does both make and mar
walewyng with his wawes and to^blyng as a ball
Her matters they meuyd fall what may befall
There was the first sight yt ever I them saw
And if I never do efte I recke not a straw
But now to my matter to return again
And to begin. new where I left
when all the goddis had done her besy pain
They wey to contryue how he should be reft
Of his life that Attropos had no cause eft
To co^playn than Phoebus stert upon her fete
And said I pray you let me speak a word yete
Othea meneth well to sey on this wise
But al to entrete Neptunus I hope shall not need
Me seems I aloue durst take that enterprise
Er I am begyled or else I shall speed
How say ye Neptunus shall I do this deed
will ye your rancour sease at my request
Madame quod he reule me as ye lyketh best
Gramercy said she of your good will
That it pleases you to show me that favor
wherefore the goddys high pleasure to fulfill
Perform my desire. and leave all old rancour
For our alders well and saving of our honor
Again this Colus that ye long have had
Hit is done quo^ he forsooth than am I glad
Said he now than Colus be you to us true
Keep well the eyr and our great rebel
May we than soon ever to us subdew
yes and that quod Colus shall ye here tell
Nowhere in the air shall he rest nor dwell
If he do thereof put me in the fault
with my bitter blastes. so shall I him asaute
what said the god Pluto what is his name
That thus presumes again us to rebel
Virtue quod Attropes yt have he mykyll shame
He is never confounded. thus of him here I tell
A said this Pluto. in deed I know him well
He has be ever mine utter enemy
wherefore this matter again him take will I
For all the baytys that ye for him have laid
without mine help be not worth a peer
For though ye all the cou^trarye had said
Yet would he bread right nygh your althrys eere
No manner of thing can him hurt nor dear
Save oonly one a sone of my bastard
whoos name is vice he keeps my vawarde
wherefore you Cerberus now I the dyscharge
Of Colus. and will that thou hyder fette
My dear sone Vice and say that I him charge
That he to me come without any let
Armed all points. for a day is set
That he with virtue for all the goddys sake
In our defense. must on him battle take
Forth then went Cerberus with his fyry cheyne
And brought theder Vice as he co^mau^den was
Again noble Virtue that battle to dereygne
On a glydyng serpent rydyng a great pas
Formyd like a dragon scalyd hard as glass
whoos mouth flammed fire without fayll
wings had hit serpentyne and a long tayll
Armed was Vice all in cure boil
Hard as any horn blacker fer than soot
An ungoodly sort followed him parde
Of unhappy capteyns of myscheyf cropp^ and root
Pride was the first. y^ next him rood god woot
On a roryng lion. next whom came Envy
Syttyng on a wolf he had a scornful ey
wrath bestrode a wild bore and next hy^ ganryde
In his hand he bare a bloody naked sword
Next whom came Couetyse yt gooth so fer and wide
Rydyng on a Olyfaunt as he had been aferde
After whom rood Gloteny with his fat berde
Syttyng on a bear with his great belly
And next him on a goot followed Lechery
Slouthe was so slepy. he came all behind
On a dull ass a full weary pase
These were the capteyns yt Vice could find
Best to set his field and follow on the chase
As for pety Capteyns many moo there wase
As sacrylege symony and dyssymulacyon
Manslaughter mordre theft and extorcyon
Arrogaunce presumpcyon with contumacy
Contempcyon contempt and Inobedyence
Malice frowardnes great Ielacy
woodnesse hate strife and Impacyence
Unkindness opp^ssyon with woeful neclygence
Murmour myscheef falsehood and detraccyon
Usury perjury lie and adulacyon
wrong rauyne sturdy vyolence
False Judgment with obstynacy
Dysceyte dronkenes and Improuydence
Boldness in ill with foul and rybaudy
Fornycacyon Incest and auoutry
Unshamefastness with prodygalyte
Blaspheme vaynglory and worldly vanyte
Agnoraunce dyffydence with Ipocrysy
Scysme rancour debate and offense
Heresy error with ydolatry
New fangylnesse and sotyll false pretense
Inordynat desire of worldly excellense
Feyned pouerte with apostasy
Dysclaunder scorn and unkind Ielousy
Hoordome bawdry false mayntenaunce
Treason abusyon. and pety brybry
Vsurpacyon with horrybly vengeance
Came alder last of that company
All these pety capteyns followed by and by
Showing theymselfe in the paleyse wide
And said they were ready that battle to abide
Iolynesse set the commons in array
without the paleyse on a fair field
But there was an oost for to make a fraye
I crow such a another never man beheld
Many was the wepyn among he^ yt they welde
what people they were yt came to that dysporte
I shall you declare of many a sundry sort
There were bosters hraghers and brybores
Praters fasers strechers and wrythers
Shameful shakerles soleyn shaueldores
Oppressors of people and mighty crakers
Mayntenours of quarelles horrible liars
Thieves traitors with false heretykes
Charmers sorcerers and many scysmatykes
Preuy symonyakes with false usurers
Multyplyers coin wasshers and clyppers
wrong usurpers with great extorcyoners
Bacbyters glosers and fair flaterers
Malycyous murmurers with great claterers
Tregetours triphelers feyners of tales
Lastyuous lurdeyns and pykers of males
Rowners vagaboundys forgers and lesynges
Robbers reuers rauenouse ryfelers
Choppers of chyrches fynders of tidings
Marrers of matters and monye makers
Stalkers by night with euesdroppers
Fyghters brawlers brekers of lofedayes
Getters chyders causers of frayes
Ty^yuylles tyrauntes with tormentoures
Cursed apostatis relygyous dyssymulers
Closshers carders with common hasardoures
Tyburne coloppys and pursekytters
Pylary knights double tollyng myllers
Gay Ioly tapsters with hostelers of the stews
Hoores and bawdes that many bale brewes
Bold blasphemers with false ypocrytes
Brothellers brokers abhomynable swerers
Dryuelles dastardes dyspysers of ryghtes
Homycydes poyseners and common morderers
Skoldes caytyffes comberouse clappers
Ydolatres enchauntours with false renegates
Sotyll ambydextres and sekers of debates
Pseudo prophets false sodemytes
Quesmers of childern with fornycatours
wetewoldis that suffer sin in her syghtes
Auouterers and abhomynable auauntours
Of sin great clappers and makers of clamours
Vnthrystes and vnlustes came also to that game
with luskes and loselles yt might not thryue for sha me
These were the commons came thither yt day
Ready bowne in battle Virtue to abide
Apollo them beholding began for to say
To the goddis and goddesses being there y^ tide
Me seems conuenyent an herowde to ride
To Virtue and bid hy^ to battle make hy^ bone
Himself to defend forsothe hit shall be soue
And let him not be sodeyuly take
All dyspurueyde or than he beware
For than should our dishonor awake
If he were cowardly take in a snare
Be quod Vice for that have I no care
I will advantage take where I may
That heryng Morpleus pryuely stale away
And went to warn Virtue of all this afray
And bad him awake and make himself strong
For he was like to endure that day
A great mortal shoure er hit were euesong
with Vice wherefore he bade him not long
Tarry to send after more socour
If he deed hit should turn him to dolor
And brefely the matter to him he declared
Like as ye have herd beginning and end
well quod Virtue he shall not be spared
To the field I will wend how it wend
But gramercy Morpleus mine own dear frend^
Of your true heart and feythfull intent
That ye in this matter to me ward have meant
This done Morpleus departed away
Fro Virtue to the paleys retournyng again
None him aspyed that I dar well say
In which time Virtue did his besy pain
People to reyse his quarrel to mentayn
ymagynacyon was his messengere
He went to warn people both fer and nere
And bad hem come in all the haste they might
For to strength Virtue for without fayll
He said he should have long or it were night
with Vice to do a mighty strong battle
Of ungracious gastes he brings a long tayll
wherefore it behooves to help at this need
And after this shall Virtue reward your mede
when ymagyuacyon had gone his cyrcuyte
To Virtues frendys thus all about
within short time many men of might
Gadered to Virtue in all that they moute
They him comforted and bad him put no doubt
His utter enmy Vice to overthrow
Though he with hy^ brought never so great arowe
And when Virtue see the sustau^ce of his oost
He prayed all the commons to the field hem hy
with her pety capteyns both lest and most
And with his capteynes should follow redely
For he said he knew well yt Vice was full ny
And who might first of ye field recover ye center
would keep out yt other he should not easily enter
Than sent he forth baptyme to the field before
And prayed him hertely hit to ouerse
That nomaner train nor caltrop therein wore
To noy nor hurt him nor his meyne
And when he thither came he began to se
How Vice his purseuaunt crime orygynall
was entered before and had seized up all
But as soon as hereof baptyme had a sight
He fled fast away and left the field allone
And anon Baptyme entered with his might
Serchyng al about where this crime had gone
But the field was clean defaute fond he none
Than came Virtue after with his great oost
And his mighty capytayns both lest and most
But to inform you how he thither came
And what manner capiteyns he to ye feld brought
Himself sekerly was the first man
Of all his great boost y^ thyderwarde sought
Syttyng in a chare yt rychely was wrought
with gold and peerles and gemmes precious
Crowned with laurer as lord vyctoryous
Four doubty knights about the chare went
At every corner one hit for to gyde
And convey according to Virtue his intent
At the first corner was ryghtwysnesse yt tide
Prudence at the second was set to abide
At the thryd strength ye fourth kept temperau^ce
These the chare gyded to Virtue his pleasau^ce
Next to the chare seven capteyns there roode
Echone after other in order by and by
Humylyte was the first a lamb he bestroode
with contenau^ce demure he rood full soberly
A fawcon gentle stood on his helm on hy
And next after him came there charity
Rydyng on a tygre as fill to his degree
Roody as a roose ay he kept his chere
On his helm on high a pellycan he bare
Next whom came pacye^ce yt no where has no pere
On a camel rydyng as void of all care
A fenix on his helm stood so forth began he fare
who next him followed but lyberalyte
Syttyng on a dromedary yt was both good and fre
On his helm for his crest he bare on ospray
And next after him followed abstynence
Rydyng on an heart was trapure and gay
He seemed a lord of right great excellence
A popyniay was his crest he was of great dyffe^ce
Next him followed chastyte on an unicorn
Armed at all points behind and beforne
A tortyldoue he bare on high for his crest
Than came good business last of tho seven
Rydyng on a panter a sundry colored best
Gloryously beseen as he had come from heaven
A crane on his head stood his crest for to steven
All these. vii. capteyns had standardis of price
Each of hem according after his deuyse
Many pety capteyns after these went
As true feyth and hope mercy pease and pity
Right troth meekness with good intent
Goodness concord and parfyte unity
Honest true love with symplycyte
Prayer fasting preuy almysdede
Joined with the artycles of the creed
Confession contrycyon and satysfaccyon
with sorrow for sin and great repentance
Foryeuenesse of trespass with good dysposycyon
Resystence of wrong performyng of penance
Holy devotion with good contynuaunce
Preesthode them followed with the sacvame^tis
And sadness also with the co^maundementis
Suffraunce in trouble with Innocensy
Clennesse contynence and virgynyte
Kyndenesse reverence with curtesy
Content and pleased with pyteous pouerte
Entendyng well mynystryng equity
Twene right and wrong hole Indyfferency
And laboryng the service of god to multyply
Refuse of richesse and worldly vaynglory
Perfeccyon with parfyte contemplacyon
Relygyon professyon well kept in memory
Verrey dread of god with holy predycacyon
Celestyall sapyence with goostly Inspyracyon
Grace was the guide of all this great meyny
whom followed konnyng with his genealogy
That is to say Gramer and Sophystry
Philosophy natural Logyke and Rethoryke
Arsmetryke Geometry with Astronomye
Canon and Cyuyle melodyous Musyke
Nobell Theologye and corporal Physyke
Moralyzacyon of holy scripture
Profounde Poetry and drawyng of pycture
These followed konnyng and thither with hy^ came
with many one moo offryng her service
To Virtue at y^ need but notwithstondyng than
Some he refused and said in nowyse
They should with him go and as I could auyse
These were her names first Nygromancy
Geomansy Magyke and Glotony
Adryomancy Ornomancy with Pyromancy
Fysenomy also and Pawmestry
And all her sequelys if I shall not ly
Yet konnyng prayed Virtue he would not deny
Them for to know nor dysdayne with his ey
On hem to look whereto Virtue granted
How be it in his werres he would not they hau^ted
So had they konnyng lightly to depart
From Virtue his field and they seeing this
By common assent hired them a carte
And made hem be carried toward Vice I wys
Fro thens forth to serve hy^ they would not mys
Full loathe they were to be maysterles
Instead of the better the worse there they ches
But forth to relese all the remenaunt
Of pety capteyns that with Virtue were
Moderate dyete and wisdom auenaunt
Even wight and mesure ware of co^tagyous gere
Loathe to offend and loving ay to lere
worship and profyt with myrthe in manner
These pety captayns with Virtue were in fere
Commons hem followed a great multitude
But in come pyson to that other side
I trow there was not brefely to conclude
The.x. man that battle to abide
yet nevertheless I shall not fro you hyde
what manner people they were and of what sect
As nere as my wit thereto will me dyrecte
There were notable and famous doctors
Example yeuers of living gracyous
Perpetuell prestes and dyscrete confessors
Of holy scripture declarers fructuous
Rebukers of sin and myschyues odyous
Fysshers of souls and lovers of clennes
Dyspysers of vain and worldly riches
Peasyble prelates Iustycyall governors
Founders of chirches with merciful peers
Roformers of wrong of her progenytours
On paynfull poor pyteous compassyoneres
well menyng merchau^ces with true artifyceres
Virgyns pure and also Innocents
Holy matrones with chaste contynentes
Pylgryms and palmers with true laborers
Holy heremytes goddys solycytours
Monasteryall monks and well dysposed freres
Chanons and nonnes teythfull professors
Of worldly people true coniugatours
Lovers of christ confounders of ill
And all that to godwarde give her good will
Mayntenours of right verrey penytentis
Dystroyers of error causers of unity
True actyfe lyuers that set her ententis
The deeds to perform of mercy and pity
Contemplatyfe people that desire to be
Solytary servants unto god allone
Rather tha^ to habou^de in rychesses euerychone
These with many mo than I rehearse can
were come thither ready that battle to abide
And take such part as fill to Virtue than
Vice to overcome they hoped for all his pride
All though that he had more people on his side
For the men that Virtue had were full sure
To trust on at need and konnyng in armure
Macrocosme was the name of the field
where this great battle was set for to be
In the mids thereof stood conscience and beheld
which of hem should be brought to captyuyte
Of that noble tryumphe Judge would he be
Synderesys sat hy^ within closed as in a park
with his tables in his ho^de her deeds to mark
To come in to the field were high ways five
Free to both parties large brood and wide
Virtue would not tarry but hyghed hy^ thyd blyue
Lest he were by vice deceived at that tide
Long out of the field loathe he was to abide
In adventure that he out of hit were not kept
For than would he have thought he had to long slept
In this mean time while Virtue thus provided
For him and his people the field for to win
He charged every man by grace to be guyded
And all that ever might the field to enter ynne
In all that season went orygynall sin
To let Vice know how baptym with his oost
Had entered Macrocosme and serched every coost
A said vice than I see well hit is time
Baners to dysplay and standards to auau^ce
All most to long had thou tarried crime
To let us have knowledge of this purueau^ce
yet I trow I shall learn hem a new dau^ce
where fore I command you all without delay
Toward the field draw in all the have ye may
Than said ye god Pluto yt all men might here
Vice I the charge as thou wylt eschew
Our heuyous Indygnacyon you draw not arere
But put the forth boldly to overthrow Vertew
In feyth quoth Attropos and I shall after sew
For if he escape your hondys this day
I tell you my service have lost for ay
Forth than rode Vice with all his hole strength
On his stead serpentyne as I told you before
The oost yt him followed was of a great length
Among who^ were penou^s and gnytors many a score
But as he went thedward I shall tell you more
Of his pety captayns he made many a knynht
For they should not fle but manly with hy^ fight
He doubled falshode with dyssymulacyon
Symony usure wrong and rybawdy
Malice deceyte lie without extorcyon
Perjury dyffydence and apostasy
with boldness in ill to bear hem company
These.xiiii. knyngtes made Vice that day
To wy^ne their spores they said they would asay
In like wise Virtue doubled on his side
Of his pety capteyns other fourtene
which made her auowe with him to abide
Her spores would they wy^ne yt day it should be seen
These were her names if it be as I wene
Feythe hope and mercy truth and also right
with resystence of wrong a full hardy wight
Confession contrycyon with satysfaccyon
Verrey dread of god performyng of penance
Perfeccyon konnyng and good dysposycyon
And all knyt to Virtue they were by allyaunce
wherefore to him they made assurance
That field to keep as long as they might
And in his quarrel again Vice to fight
The lord of Macrocosme and rewler of yt fee
was called frewyll chaunger of the chaunse
To whom Virtue sent embassatours three
Reason dyscresyon and good reme^brau^se
And prayed hy^ be favorable his honor to enhau^se
For but he had his favor at yt point of need
He stood in great doubt he could not lightly speed
In like wise Vice embassatours three
For his party unto Frewyll sent
Temptacyon folly and sensualyte
Prayng him of favor that he would assent
To him as he would at his commandment
Have him eftsoon when he list to call
On him for any thing yt afterward might fall
Answer yaue he none to neither party
Save oonly he said the battle would he se
To wete which of hem should have the vyctory
Hit hyng in his balau^ce the ambyguyte
He said he would not restrain his lyberte
when he come where sorrow should awake
Than it should be know what part he will take
when Virtue and Vice be her ambassatours
Knew of this answer they stood in great doubt
Neutheles they said they would e^dure tho shours
And make an end shortly of yt they went about
So forth came Vice with all his great route
Er he came at the field he sent yet pryuely
Sensualyte before in manner of a spy
which sewe the field with his unkind seed
That caused Virtue after mykyll woo to feel
For thereof grew naught but all oonly weed
which made the ground as sleper as an yele
He went ayene to Vice and told him every dele
How he had done and bad him come away
For he had so purueyde yt Vice should have ye day
So as hit happed at the field they mete
Frewyll Virtue and Vice as trypartyte
Saaf Virtue a little before the field had get
And ellis his auau^tage forsooth had be full light
Not for then encombred so was never wight
As Virtue and his men were with the rank wede
That in the field grew of sensualytees sede
But as soon as Vice of Virtue had a sight
He began swage gonnes as he had be wode
That heryng Virtue commanded every wight
To pauyse him under the sign of the rode
And bad he^ not dread. but keep still where they stood
It was but a shour should soon co^fou^de
wherefore he commanded them stand and keep her ground
And when Vice came nerer to the field
He called sore for bows and bad hem shote fast
But Virtue and his meyny bare of with the shield
Of the blessed Trynyte ay till shot was past
And wha^ shot was done Vice came forth at last
Purposyng the field with assaute to win
But virtue kept it long he might not enter theryn
All that time Frewyll stood and him bethought
To which he might leave and what part he would take
At last sensualyte had hy^ so fer brought
That he said plainly he dtu would forsake
And in Vice his quarrel all his power make
Iwys quoth reason that is not for the best Nota

Noforse said frewyll I will do as my list
Virtue was full heavy when he see frewyll
Take part with Vice but yet nevertheless
He did that he might the field to keep still
Till Vice with frewyll so sore began hy^ oppress
That he was constrained clearly by duresse
A little tyne abacke to make abew retret
All thing considered hit was the best feet
First to remember how Vices part was
Ten ayene one strenger by lyklynesse
And than how frewyll was with him alas
whoo could deem Virtue but in heaviness
Moreover to think how that slyper grass
That of sensualyte his unkind seed grew
Under foot in standing encombred Vertew
yet notwithstondyng Virtue his men all
Nobelly them bare and faught myghtyly
How be it y^ sleper grass made many of he^ fall
And from thense in manner depart suddenly
That seeing Vice his oost began to shout and cry
And said on in Pluto name on and all is our
For this day shall Vice be made a co^queroure
Thus Virtue was by might of Vice and Frewyll
Dreuen out of the field it was the more pity
How be hit yet Baptyme kept his ground still
And with him abode feythe hope and unity
And konnyng also with commons a great meyne
Confession contrycyon were ready at her hand
And satysfaccyon Vice to withstonde
But all the time while Virtue was away
A mighty conflycte kept they with Vice his route
And yet nevertheless for all yt great affray
Hope stood up right and feythe would neuerloute
And evermore said Baptym syres put no doubt
Virtue shall return and have his entente
This field shall be our and else let me be shent de
And while these pety capteyns sustained thus ye fell
with Virtue his reward came good perseuerau^ce
An hogy mighty host and when he beheld
How Virtue him withdrew he took dysplesau^ce
And wha^ he to hy^ came he said ye shall your chance
Take as it falls wherefore return ye must
Yet ones for your sake with Vice shall I Just
Alas that ever ye should leese thus your honor
And therewith also the high perpetuell crown
which is for you kept in the celestyall tour
wherefore be ye called Crystis champyone
How is it that ye have no compassyone
On baptyme feyth and hope konnyng and unity
That stand so hard bestad and fight as ye may see
All the tresour erthely under the fyrmament
That ever was made of goddys creacyon
To reward them euenly were not equyualent
For her noble labor in his afflyccyon
wherefore take upon you your Iurisdyccyon
Rescu yonder knights and recontynu fight
And else a dew your crown for all your great might
with these and such words as I have you told
By good perseueraunce vttred in this wise
Virtue him remembered and began to wexe bold
And said give true knyghtis to rescu I auyse
Let us no longer tarry from this entrepryse
Again to the field so Virtue returned
That caused he^ be merry yt long before had morned
Auaunt baner quoth he in the name of Ihesu
And with yt his people set up a great shoute
And cried with a loud voice a Virtue a Virtue
Then began Vice his host for to look about
But I trow perseuerau^ce was not long without
He bathed his swerd in his foos blood
The boldest of hem all not ones hy^ withstood
Constau^ce him followed and brought hy^ his spear
But when perseuerau^ce saw Vice on his stead
Noman could him let till he came there
For to bid him ride I trow it was no need
All Virtue his oost prayed for his good speed
Again Vice he rode with his great shaft
And him overthrew for all his sotyll craft
That seeing Frewyll came to conscience
And began him to repent yt he with him had be
Prayeng him of counsel for his great offense
That he again Virtue had made his arm
what was best to do to humylyte
Quoth conscience must you go so he him thither sent
Dysguysed yt he were not known as he went
And when he thither came humylyte him took
A token and bad him go to confession
And show him his matter with a pyteous look
which done he him sent to contrycyon
And fro thensforthe to satysfaccyon
Thus fro poost to pyler was he made to dau^ce
And at the last he went forth to penance
But now for to tell you when vice was outhrow
A great part of his oost about him began resort
But he was so febyll yt he could noman know
And when they see yt they knew no comfort
But carried him a way be a preuy port
And as they him carried dyspeyre with hy^ met
with Vice his reward he came them for to fet
Then came there down goodly ladies tweyn
From the high heaven above the fyrmament
And said the great Alpha and Oo most souereyn
For that nobell tryumphe had hem thither sent
One of hem to drive Vice to great torment
with a fyry strong yt she bare in her hand
And so he deed dyspere and all his hole band
The name of this lady was called Prestyence
She never left Vice ne none yt would hy^ follow
Till they were committed by ye dyuyne sentence
All to pain perpetuell and Infynyte sorrow
Rightwysnes went to se yt noma^ should he^ borow
Thus all entreted sharply were they till Cerberus
Had hem beshut within his gates tenebrus
And all y^ while y^ Prestyence with her scorge smert
To reward Vice began her thus occupy
with all his hole bend after her desert
That other glorious lady yt came fro heaven on hy
Having in her hand the palm of vyctory
Came down to Virtue and took him to y^ p^sent
Saying thus that Alpha and Oo has him sent
And as far as I a right could understand
That ladies name was Predestynacyon
Virtue and his host she blessed with her hand
And in heaven granted hem habytacyon
where to each of hem reserved was a crown
She said in token that they enherytours
Of the glory were and gracyous conquerours
which done the ladies ayene together met
And toward heaven up they began to sty
Embraced in arms as they had be knet
Together with a gyrdell but so suddenly
As they were vanysshed saw I never thy^g with ey
And anon Virtue with all his company
Knelyd down and thanked god of that vyctory
Yet had I foryete when Vice was overthrow
To have told you how many of Vice his oost
Began to seek pease and darked down full low
And besought mercy what so ever hit cost
To be her mean to Virtue ellis they were but lost
And some in like wise to feyth and hope sought
what to do for pease they said they ne rought
Some also to baptyme sewed to be her mean
Some to one some to other as they he^ get myt
But all to confession went to make hem clean
And as they came to co^scye^ce he they^ bad go lyt
Er than old Attropos of hem had a sight
For if he so them took lost they were for ever
He said Vice to forsake is better late tha^ never
Some eke for socour drew to cyrcu^cysyon
But by him could they get but small favor
For he in yt company was had but in derysyon
Nevertheless to feyth he bad hem go labor
Prayeng they^ for old acqueynta^ce they^ socour
well quoth feth for his sake I shall do yt I may do
But first for the best way baptyme go ye to
For by him soonest shall ye recover grace
which shall to Virtue bring you by process
wherefore in any wise look ye make good face
And let noman know of your heaviness
So they were by bapty^ brought out of dystresse
Turned all to Virtue and when this was done
Virtue commanded Frewyll before him come
To whom thus he said I have great meruayll
ye durst be so bold Vices part to take
who bad you do so and yaue you that cou^sayll
Justly unto that ye shall me preuy make
Then said Frewyll and swemfully spoke
Knelyng on his knee with a chere benygne
I pray you sir let pity your e^res to me enclyne
And I shall you tell the verrey sothe of all
How it was and who made me that way draw
Forsothe Sensualyte his propre name they call
A said reason then I know well yt felawe
wild he is and wanton of me stant hy^ none awe
Is he so quoth Virtue well he shall be taught
As a player should to draw a another draught
And with yt came sadness with his sobre chere
Bryngyng sensualyte being full of thought
And said that he had take him prysonere
A welcome said Virtue now have I yt I sought
Blessed be yt good lord as you would is it naught
why art you so wanton and wild he said for shame
Er you go at large you shall be made more tame word
But stand a part a while till I have spoke a
with Frewyll a little and then shall you know
what shall be thy fynau^ce and then he said in board
Unto Frewyll the ben of your bow
Begins to slake but such as ye have sow
Must ye needs repe there is none other way
Not withstondyng yt let se what ye can say
what is your habylyte me to recompense
For the great harm that ye to me have do
Forsothe said Frewyll in open audyence
But oonly Macrocosme more have I not lo
Take y^ if it please you I will yt hit be so
If I may understand ye be my good lord
In deed said Virtue to that will I acorde
Then made Virtue Reason his lyeftenau^t
And yaue hy^ a great charge Macrocosme to keep
That done Sensualyte yield him recreau^t
And began for to anger bytterly to weep
For he demed surely his sorrow should not sleep
Then made Virtue Frewyll bayll vnd Reason
The field for to occupy to his behoue ye season
And then said Virtue to Sensualyte
Thou shall be rewarded for thy business
Under this form all fragylyte
Shall thou forsake both more and less
And vnd the guydyng shall thou be of sadness
All though hit somewhat be again thy heart
Thy Judgment is yeuen thou shall it not astert
And even with that came in dame Nature
Saying thus to Virtue sir ye do me wrong
By duresse and constraynt to put this creature
Gentle Sensualyte yt has me served long
Clearly from his lyberte and set him among
Them that love him not to be her vndlowte
As it were a cast away or a shoo clowte
And parde ye know well a rewle have I must
within Macrocosme forsooth I say not nay
Quoth Virtue but sensualyte shall not perform your lust
Like as he has do before this if I may
Therfro him restrayn sadness shall assay
How be it ye shall have your hole lyberte
within Macrocosme as ye have had fre
And when Virtue had to Nature said thus
A little tyne his ey castyng him beside
He see in a corner standing Morpleus
That him before warned of the verryly tide
A syres said Virtue yet we must abide
Here is a friend of our may not be foryete
After his deserte we shall him entreat
Morpleus said Virtue I thank you hertely
For your true heart and your great labor
That ye list to come to me so redely
when ye understood the coming of ye shoure
I thank god and you of saving of mine honor
whefore this preuylege now to you I grant
That within Macrocosme ye shall have your hau^t
And of five posternes the keys shall ye keep
Lettyng in and out at hem whom ye list
As long as in Macrocosme your fad will crepe
Blere whose ey ye will hardly with your mist
And keep your works close there as in a chyst
Saaf I would desire you spare Pollucyon
For no thing may me plese yt souneth to corrupcyon
And wha^ he had thus said ye keys he hy^ took
And toward his castle with his peopell went
Byddyng reason take good head and about look
That sensualyte by Nature were not shent
Keep him short he said till his lust be spent
For better were a child to be vnbore
Than let him have the will and for ever be lore
And wha^ old Attropos had seen and herd all this
How Virtue had opteyned astonyed as he stood
He said to himself somewhat there is amys
I trow well my patent be not all good
And ran to the paleys as he had be wood
Saying to the goddys I see ye do but iape
After a worthy whew have ye made me gape
How a devil way should I Virtue overthrow
when he dredeth not all your hole route
How ca^ ye make good your pate^t would I know
Hit is to Impossyble to bring that about
For stryke him may I not yt is out of doubt
A good Attropos said god Apollo
An answer conuenyent shall thou have herto
The words of thy patent dare I well say
Stretche to no ferther but were dame Nature
Has Iurysdiccyon there to have thy way Nota

And largess to stryke as longs to thy cure
And as for Virtue he is no creature
Under the predycament contained of quantyte
wherefore his destruccyon longs not to the
A ha said Attropos then I see well
That all ye goddys be but counterfete
For oo God there is that can euerydell
Turn as him list both dry and whete
In to whoos service I shall assay to get
And if I may ones to his service come
your names shall be put to oblyuyone
Thus went Attropos fro the paleys wrooth
But in the mean time while yt he there was
Glydyng by the paleys resydyuacyon gooth
Toward Macrocosme with a peynted fase
Clad like a pilgrim walkyng a great pase
In the form as he had been a man of ynde
He wend have made reason and sadness both bly^de
With sensualyte was he soon aqueynted
To whom he declared his matter pryuely
yet he was espied for all his face peynted
Then reason hy commanded pyke hy^ the^s lightly
For his ease quoth sadness so counsel him will I
So was sensualyte ay kept under foot
That to resydyuacyon might he do no boot
Then went he to Nature and asked her auyse
His intent to opteyne what was best to do
She said ever sith Virtue of Vice wan ye pryse
Reason with sadness has rewled the field so
That I and sensualyte may little for the do
For I may no more but oonly keep my course
And yet is sensualyte strenger kept and wours
Thus hery^g resydiuaco^n fro the^s he went ageyn
Full of thought and sorrow yt he might not speed
Than reason and sadness took wedehokes tweyn
And all wild wa^tones out of ye field began wede
With all the slyper grass yt grew of the sede
That sensualyte before therein sew
And fro thens forth kept it clean for Vertew
Than began new grass in the field to spryng
All unlike yt other of color fair and bright
But then I aspyed a marvelous thing
For the ground of ye field began wex hoar and white
I could not conceive how that be might
Till I was informed and taught it to know
But where Virtue occupyeth must needs well grow
yet in the mean time while the field thus grew
And reason with sadness thereof had governance
Many a preuy messenger thither sent Vertew
To know if it were guyded to his plesau^ce
Now prayer eft fasting and often time penance
And when he might goo pryuely almesdede
And bad hy^ to his power help where he se need
while y^ field thus rewled reason with sadness
Maugre dame Nature for all her carnal might Nota

Came thither Attropos void of all gladness
wrapped in his shete and axed if any wight
Could wysshe him the wey to the lord of light
Or ellis where men might find ryghwysnesse
Forsothe said reasan I trow as I guess
At Virtue his castle ye may soon him find
If ye list the labor thither to take
And there shall ye know if ye be not blind
The next wey to the lord of light I undertake
So thither went Attropos petycyon to make
To ryghtwysnesse prayeng that he might
Be take in to the service of the lord of light
what said ryghtwysnesse you old dotyng fool
whom have thou served sith the world began
But oonly him where have you go to scoole
whether art you double or else the same man
That thou were first a sir said he than
I pray you hertely hold me excused
I am old and febell my wits are dysused
well said ryghtwysnes for as much as thou
know not thy may thy name shall I change
Death shall you be called from hens forward now
Among all the people that shall be had strange
But when you begynnest to make thy chalau^ge
Dredde shall thou be where so thou become
And to no creature shall thou be welcome
And as for them whom thou dedest serve
For as much as they presume on hem to take
That high name of god they shall as they deserve
Therefore be rewarded I dare vndtake
with pain perpetuell among fendes blake
And her names shall be put to oblyuyon
Among men but it be in derysyon
A ha said Attropos now begy^ne I wex glad
That I shall thus avenged of hem be
Sith they so long time have made me so mad
ye quoth ryghtwysnesse here what I say to the
The lord of light sent the word by me
That in Macrocosine sesyne shall thou take
wherefore thy darte ready look thou make
And as soon as Virtue that understood
He said he was pleased that it should so be
And even forthwith he commanded preesthood
To make him ready the field for to se
So thither went preesthode with benygnyte
Conueyentg thither the blessed sacrament
Of Eukaryst but first were thither sent
Confession contrycyon and satysfaccyon Nota

Sorrow for sin and great repentance
Holy devotion with good dysposycyon
All these thither came and also penance
As her dewte was to make purueaunce
Again the coming of that blessed lord
Feyth hope and charity thereto were acorde
Reason with sadness did his dylygence
To cleanse the field within and without
And when they se the bodily presence
Of that holy Eukaryst lowly began they lout
So was that lord received out of dout
with all humble chere debonayre and benygne
Lykly to his pleasure it was a great sign
Then came to the field the mynyster fynall
Called holy vnccyon with a crysmatory
The five hye ways in especyall
Thereof he anointed and made hit sanctuary
whom tolowed death which would not carry
His fervent power there to put in ure
As he was commanded grau^tyng dame Nature Nota

He took his darte called his mortal lau^ce
And bent his stroke toward the feldes heart
That seeing preesthode bad good remenbrau^ce
Toward the field turn him and aduerte
For except him all virtues thense must sterte
And even with that death there sesyne took
And then all the company clearly hit forsook
And as soon as death thus had sesyne take
The color of the field was changed suddenly
The grass therein seere as though it had be bake
And the five high ways were mured upon hy
That fro thensforward none enter should thereby
The posternes were also without let
Both inward and outward fine fast shette
which done suddenly death vanysshed away
And Virtue exalted was above the fyrmament
where he coke the crown of glory yt is ay
Preparate by Alpha and oo omnypotent
The sweet fruit of macrocosme thither with he^ went
And on all this matter as I stood musyng thus
Again fro the field to me came Morpleus
Saying thus what chere how lyketh y^ this fight
Haste thou seen enough or will thou see more
Nay sir I said my truth I you plyght
This is suffycyente if I knew wherefore
This was to me showed for theroft he lore
Coueyte I to have if I get might
Follow me quod he and have thy delyght
So I him followed till he had me brought
To a foresquare herber walled round about
Loo quoth Morpleus here may thou yt thou sought
Find if thou will I put the out of doubt
A little while we stood ^^yll there without
Till wit chyef porter of that herber gate
Required by stodye let us in there ate
But when I came in I meruayled greatly
Of that I beheld and herd there report
For first in a chair apparaylled royally
There sat dam doctrine her childern to exorte
And about her was many a sundry sort
Some wyllyng to learn diverse science
And some for to have perfyte intellygence
Crowned she was like an Emperesse
with.iii. crowns standing on her head on hy
All thing about her an Infynyte process
were to declare I tell you certainly
Nevertheless some in mind thereof have I
which I shall to you as god will give me grace
As I saw and herd tell in short space
Fast by Doctrine on that one side
As I remember sat holy Text
That opened his mouth to the people wide
But not in comparyson to Gloss yt sat next
Moralyzacyon with a cloak contexte
Sat and Scripture was scrybe to them all
He sat ay writing of that that should fall
These were tho that I there knew
By no manner way of old acqueyntau^ce
But as I before saw them with Vertewe
Company in field and having dalyau^ce
And as I thus stood half in a trau^ce
while they were occupied in her business
About the walls mine ey began I dress
where I beheld the meruaylous story
That ever I yet saw in any pycture
For on tho walls was made memory
Syngulerly of every creature
That there had been both form and stature
whoos names rehearse I will as I can
Bring them to mind in order every man
First to begin there was in portrature
Adam and Eve holdyng an appell round
Noe in a ship and Abraham having sure
A flyntstone in his hand and Isaac lay bound
On an high mou^te Jacob slepyng sound
And a long ladder stood him beside
Joseph in a Cysterne was also there yt tide
Next whom stood Moses with his tables two
Aaron and Vrre his arms supportyng
Ely in a brennyng chare was there also
And Elyze stood clad in an hermytis clothyng
Dauyd with an harp and a stone slyng
Isaye Jeremy and Ezechyell
And closed with lions holy Danyell
Abacuc Mychee with Malachy
And Jonas out of a whales body coming
Samuel in a Temple and holy zachary
Beside an altar all blody standing
Ozee with Iudyth stood there conspyryng
The death of Oloferne and Salamon also
A child with his sword dyuydyng in two
Many moo prophetis certainly there were
whoos names now come not to my mind
Melchysedech also aspyed I there
Bread and wine offryng as fill to his kind
Ioachym and Anna stood all behind
Embraced in arms to the golden gate
And holy Johan baptyst in a desert sat
And now comes to my remembrance
I am auysed I saw Sodechy
And Amos also with sobre countenance
Standing with her faces toward Sophony
Neemye and Esdras bare hem company
The holy man Job as an Impotent
Then followed in pycture with Thoby pacyent
These with many moo on that one side
Of that grene herber portrayed were
A said Morpleus a little time abide
Turn thy face where thy back was ere
And behold well what thou see there
Than I me turned as he me badde
with heart steadfast and countenance sad
where I saw Peter with his keys stand
Poule with a sword James also
with a scalop and Thomas holdyng in his hand
A spear and Phylyp aproched him to
James the less next hem in pycture lo
Stood with Barthylmew which was all flayn
Simon and Thadee showed how they were flayn
Mathy and Barnabe drawyng lottys stood
Next whom was Mark a lion him by
His book holdyng and Matthew in his mode
Resemblyd an Angel with wings gloryously
Luke had a calfe to hold his book on hy
And Johan with a cup and palm in his hand
An Egle bare his book thus saw I hem stand
Gregory and Jerome Austyne and Ambrose
with pylyons on her hedes stood like doctors
Bernarde with Anselme and as I suppose
Thomas of alquyne and Domynyk confessors
Benet and Hew relygyous governors
Martyne and Johan with bysshoppes tweyne
were there also and Crysostome certain
Behind all these was worshypfull Bid
All behind and next him stood Orygene
Hydyng his face as he of his deed
Had hem a shamed ye woot what I mean
For of error was he not all clean
And on that side stood there last of all
The noble prophetyssa Sybyll men her call
Let me remember now I you pray
My barayne is so thynne I deem in mine heart
Some of the feleshyp that I there say
In all this while have I ouerstert
A benedycyte none ere could I aduert
To think on Andrew the apostle with his cross
whom to forgete were a great loss
Many one moo were peynted on that wall
whose names now come not to my remembrance
But these I marked in especyall
And moo could I tell in contynuau^ce
Of time but forth to show you the substance
Of this matter in the mids of that herbere
Sat Doctrine colored as any crystal clear
Crowned as I told you late here before
whoos apparayll was worth tresour Infynyte
All erthely richesse count I no more
To that in comparyson valewyng then a myte
Over her head honyd a culuer fair and white
Out of whoos byll proceeded a great leme
Downewarde to Doctrine like a son beme
The words of Doctrine yaue great redolence
In swetnes of savor to her dyscyples all
Hit far exceded myrre and frankensence
Or any other tree spyce or else gall
And wha^ she me aspyed anon she began me call
And commanded Morpleus yt he should bry^g me nere
For she would me show the effect of my desire
She said I know the cause of thy coming
Is to understand be mine enformacyon
Sensybly the matter of Morpleus his showing
As he has the led about in vysyon
wherefore now I apply thy natural reason
Unto my words and er thou hens wend
Thou shall hit know beginning and end
First where Colus to Pluto was brought
By his own neclygence taken prysonere
within the earth for he to far sought
Sygnyfyed is no more be that matere
But oonly to show the how it does apere
That welthe unbridled daily at thine ey
Increases mysrewle and often causes folly
For like as Colus being at his large
Streyted himself through his own lewdenesse
For he would deele where he had no charge
Right so wantons by her wyldenesse
Often sithe bring himself in dystresse
Be cause they sometime to largely deele
what may wors be suffered than ouermykell we will
By Mynos the Judge of hell desperate
May be understand goddys ryghtwysnes
That to every wight his pain deputate
Assygneth acordyng to his wyckednes
wherefore he is called Judge of cruelnes
And as for Dyana and Neptunus compleynt
Fygured may be fools reason feynt
For like as they made her suggestyon
To have me Colus from course of his kind
which was Impossyble to bring to correccyon
For evermore his lyberte have will the wind
In like wise fools otherwhyle be blind
wenyng to subdew with her one hand
That is ouermykell for all an hole land
But what follows thereof that shall you here
when they were come to the bankete
The great Apollo with his sad chere
So fair and curtously began them entrete
That he made her beerdys on the new get
Loo what wisdom does to a fool
wherefore are children put to scoole
Often is it seen with sobre contenaunce
That wise men fools overcome ay
Tornyng as hem list and all her varyaunce
Change from ernest in to merry play
what were they both amendeth that day
when they were dreuen to her wits end
were they not feign to grant to be his friend
Right so fools when they have done
All that they can than he they feign
Give up her matter to oblyuyone
without reward they have no more brain
And yet full often has hit be said
when they it have foryete and set at naught
That they full dear have afterward it bought
And as for all tho that represent
To be called goddys at that banquet
Resemble false ydollys but to this intent
was Morpleus commanded thither the to fet
That thou sholdest know the manner and the get
Of the paynym law and of her believe
How false ydolatry ledeth hem by the sleue
For soon upon the worldys creacyon
when Adam and Eve had broke the precept
which clerks call the time of deuyacyon
The worldly people in paynym law slept
Till moses vnd god the tables of stone kept
In which time Poets feyned many a fable
To dyscrete Reason right acceptable
And to the intent that they should sound
To the ^eres of hem the more pleasantly
That they^ should read or here they yaue they^ a ground
And addid names unto they^ naturally
Of whom they spoke and callid he^ goddis hy
Some for the strength and might of her nature
And some for her sotyll wytty conjecture
By nature thus as the seven planettes
Have her propre names by Astronomeres
But goddys were they called by old Poets
For her great feruency of werkyng in her speres
Experyence preueth this at all years
And for as other that goddys called be
For sotyll wit that shall I teache the
How they by that high name of god came
In this said time the people was so rude
That what manner creature man or woman
Loud any newelte contryue and conclude
For the common well all the multitude
Of the common people a god should him call
Or a goddess after hit was fall
Of the same thing that was so new found
As Ceres for she the craft of tithe fond
whereby more plentouously corn did habounde
The people her called through out every land
Goddess of corn wenyng in her hand
Had layn all power of corns habundau^ce
Thus were ye Paynems deceived by ignorance
In like manner Isys was called the goddess
Of fruit for she tyrst made it multyply
By the name of gryffyng and so by process
The name of Pan began to deyfy
For he first found the mean sheep to guy
Some took it also by her condycyon
As Pluto Fortune and such other done
Thus all that Poets put under couerture
Of fable the rural people hit took
Properly as act refusyng the figure
which error some of hem never forsook
Often a false myrour deceyueth a man's look
As thou may daily pryue at thine ey
Thus were the paynyms deceived generally
That seeing the dedely enemy of mankind
By his power permyssyue entered the ymagys
within the Temples to make the people blind
In her ydolatry standing on high stagys
In somoche whoo used dangerous passagys
Any manner way by water or be land
when hyd his sacryfyce his answer ready fond
Thus during the time of deuyacyon
From Adam to Moses was ydolatry
Thorugh the world used in common opinion
These were the goddys that thou there sy
And as for the a wayters that stood hem by
They polytyke Philosophers and Poets were
which feyned the fables yt I speak of here
Then seized the time of deuyacyon
when Moses received that tables of stone
Entryng the time of reuocacyon
On the mount of Synay stondyng allone
God yaue him might ayene all his fone
And then began the old testament
which to the people by Moses was sent
And that time dured the Incarnacyon
Ot Christ and then began it to sese
For then came the time of reconcylyacyon
Of man to god I tell the doutlese
when the sone of man put him in prese
wylfully to suffer death for mankind
In holy scripture this may thou find
This Reconcylyacyon was the time of grace
when founded was the church upon y^ fair stone
And to holy Peter the keye delivered was
Of heaven then hell dyspoyled was anon
Thus was mankind delivered from his font
And then began the new testament
That the christian people believe in present
which.iii. times a sundry dyuyded
May thou here see if thou list behold
The first behind the in pycture in provided
The second of the lift hand show prophet old
The.iii. on the right hand here it is to y^ told
Thus have thou in vysyon the verrey figure
Of these.iii. times here showed in purtrayture
That is to say first of deuyacyon
From Adam to Moses recordyng scripture
Second fro Moses to the Incarnacyon
Of Christ keeps reuocacyons cure
And as for the thryd thou may be verrey sure
will dure from thens to the worlds end
But now the.iiii. must thou have in mind
which is callid properly the time of pylgremage
After some and some named it otherwise
And call hit the time of dangerous passage
And some time of werre that fully hit despise
But what so it be named I will the auyse
Remember it well and prynte it in thy mind
whereof the figure may thou me behind
And else remember thyselfe in thine heart
How Vice and Virtue daily them occupy
In manner one of hem him to peruerte
Another to bring him to endeles glory
Thus they continue fight for the vyctory
Hit is no need hereof to tell the more
For in this short vysyon you have seen it before
And as for Attropos grievous compleynt
Unto the goddys betokens no more
But oonly to show the how frendely constreynt
On a steadfast heart weyeth full sore
Good will requires good will ayene therefore
Dyscorde to Death has ay been a friend
For Dyscorde brings many to her end
wherefore Death thought he would avenged be
On his friends quarrel if that he might
For her great unkindness in somoche as she
was among hem all had so in despyte
And at that banquet made of so lyte
which caused him among he^ to cast in a bone
That found they^ gnawyng enough euerychone
Thus often is seen oo friend for a another
will say and do and some time matters feyne
And also kynnysmen a cosyne or a brother
will for his aly er he have cause complain
And where that he loves do his besy pain
His friends matter as his own to take
which often sithe causes mochyll sorrow awake
Be hit right or wrong he charge not a myte
As toward that point he takes little head
So that he may have his froward appetyte
Performed he cares not how his soul speed Nota

Of God or Devil have such little dread
How be it one there is that lord is of all
which to every wight at last reward shall
And as for ye batayl between Vice and Virtue hold
So plainly appears to the inwardly
To make exposycyon thereof new or old
were but superfluyte there fore refuse hit I
In man shall thou find yt werre kept daily
Like as you have seen it fowtyne before thy face
The pycture me behynd shows it in little space
And as for Macrocosme it is no more to say
But the less world to the common intent
which applied is to man both night and day
So is man the field to which all were sent
On both parties and they that thither went
Sygnyfye no more but after the condycyon
Of every manes opinion
And as for the noble knight Perseueraunce
which gate the field when it was almost gone
Betokens nomere but the contynuaunce
Of virtuous living till death has ouergone
who so will do rewarded is anon
As Virtue was with the crown on hy
which is no more but everlasting glory
And as for Prestyence and Predestynacyon
That each of hem rewarded after his desert
Is to understand no more but dampnacyon
To vycyous people is the verrey scourge smert
Reward for they fro Virtue would pervert
And endelesse Joy is to hem that be elect
Rewarded and to all that follow the same sect
And as for the keys of the posternes five
which were to Morpleus rewarded for his labor
Sygnyfye not else but while man is on live
His five inward wits shall be every hour
In his sleep occupied in hele and in langour
with fantasyes tryfels Illusyons and dremes
which Poets call Morpleus stremes
And as for Resydyuacyon is no more to say
But after Confession tornyng ayene to sin
which to every man retorneth sanuz delay
To vycyous living again him to win
while any man lives will it never blynne
That cursed conclusyon for to bring about
But Reason with Sadness keep it still out
Here have thou properly the verrey sentence
Herd now declared of this vysyon
The pycture also yeueth clear intellygence
Thereof beholden with good dyscresyon
Look well about and take consyderasyon
As I have declared whether hit so be
A sir quoth Morpleus what told I the
Have thou not now thine hertes desire
Look on you wall yonder before
And all that time stood I in a wyre
which way first mine heart would give more
To look in a stody stood I therefore
Nevertheless at last as Morpleus me badde
I looked forward with contenaunce sad
where I beheld in portrayture
The manner of the field even as it was
Showed me before and every creature
On both sides being drawyng in small space
So curyously in so little a compace
In all this world was never thing wrought
Hit were Impossyble in earth to be thought
And when I had long behold that pycture
what quoth Morpleus how long shalt thou look
Daryng as a dastard on you portrayture
Come of for shame thy wit stante a croke
I heryng that mine heart to me took
Toward the fourth wall tornyng my vysage
where I saw Poets and Philosophers sage
Many one moo than at the banquet
Scrued the gods as I laid before
Some were made standing and some in chayris set
Some lokyng on bokis as they had stodyed sore
Some drawyng almenakis and in her hondis bore
Astyrlabes taking the altytude of the son
Among whom Dyogenes sat in a tonne
And as I was lokyng on that fourth wall
Of Dyogenes beholding the image
Suddenly Doctrine began me to call
And bad me turn toward her my vysage
And so then I did with humble courage
what thynkest you she said have you not thentent
yet of these four walls what they represent
The pycture on the first yt stands at my bake
Shows the ye present time of pylgremage
Of which before I unto the spoke
which is the time of dangerous passage
The second dyscrettly again my vysage
The time expresses of Deuyacyon
while paynyme law had the domynacyon
The thryd wall standing on my lift hand
The time represents of Reuocacyon
And the fourth standing on my right hand
Determyneth the time of Reconsylyacyon
This is the effect of thy vysyon
wherefore the needs no more thereon to muse
Hit were but vein thy wits to dysuse
But during the time of Reconsylyacyon
Thy time of pylgremage look well you spend Nota

And then well gracyous Predestynacyon
Bring the to glory at thy last end
And even with that came to my mind
My first conclusyon that I was about
To have dreuen er sleep made me to loute
That is to say how Sensualyte
with Reason to acorde might be brought about
which caused me to knele down on my kne
And beseke Doctrine determyne that doubt
Do lord god said Doctrine can you not without
Me that conclusyon bring to an end
Far is fro the wit and ferther good mende
And even with that Death began appear
Showing himself as though that he would
His darte have occupied within that herbere
But there was none for him young nor old
Save oonly I Doctrine him told
And when I herd her with him common thus
I me withdrew behind Morpleus
Dredyng full sore leest he with his dart
Thorugh Doctrynes words any entresse
In me would have had or claymed any part
which should have caused me great heaviness
within which time and short process
Came thither Reason and Sensualyte
A quoth Doctrine right welcome be ye
Hit is not long sithe we of you spoke
Ye must er ye goo determyne a doubt
And even with that she the matter brake
To them and told hit every where about
I would have be thens if I had moute
For fere I looked as blake as a cole
I would have cropen in a mouse hole
what quoth Doctrine where is he now
That meued this matter strange and dyffuse
He is a cowarde I make mine auow
He hyded his head his mocyon to refuse
Blame him not quoth Reason always yt to use
when he sees Death so nere at his hand
Yet is his part him to withstonde
Or at the least way else fro him flee
As long as he may who does otherwise
Is an ydeote quoth Sensualytee
who dredeth not Death wise men him despise
what said Doctrine how long has this gyse
Be holden and used thus a twixe you tweyne
ye were not wont to acorde certain
yes quoth Reason in this point always
To every man have we yeuen our counsayll
Death for to flee as long as they may
Al though we otherwise have done our trauayll
Each other to repress yet without fayll
In that point oonly dyscordeth we never
Thus condescended therein be we for ever
A ha said Doctrine then is the conclusyon
Clearly determined of the great doubt
That here was meuyd and half in derysyon
She me then called and bade me look out
Come forth she said and feere not this route
And even with that Reason and Sensualyte
And Death fro thens were vanysshed all three
Then looked I forth as Doctrine me badde
when Death was gone me thought I was bold
To show myself but yet was I sad
Me thought my doubt was not as I would
Clearly and openly declared and told
Hit sowned to me as a parable
Derke as a myste or a feigned fable
And Doctrine my conceyte began espy
wherefore said she stand thou so still
wherein is thy thought art thou in stody
Of thy questyon have thou not thy fill
To the declared tell me thy will
Herdest thou not Reason and Sensualyte
Declared thy doubt here before the
For sothe quoth I. I herd what they said
But nevertheless my wit is so thynne
And also of Death I was so afraid
That hit is out where hit went ynne
And so that matter can I not win
without your help and benyuolence
Thereof to express the verray sentence
well quoth Doctrine then give attendaunce
Unto my words and thou shall here
Openly declared the concordaunce
At wene Sensualyte and Reason in fere
If thou take heed hit clearly does apere
How they were knette in one opinion
Both again Death held contradyccyon
which concordaunce no more syguyfyeth
To plain understanding but in every mane
Both Sensualyte and Reason applies
Rather Death to flee then with hit to be taken
Loo in that point accord they holly thane
And in all other they clearly dyscorde
Thus is trewly set thy doubtful monacorde
I heryng that kneled on my kne
And thanked her lowly for her dyscyplyne
That she wouchesafe of her benygnyce
Of tho great doubts me to enlumyne
well was she worthy to be called Doctrine
If it had be no more but for the solucyon
Of my demand and of this strange vysyon
And as I with mine head began for to bow
As me well ought to do her reverence
She thens departed I can not tell how
But within a moment gone was she thens
Then said Morpleus let us go hens
what should we here tarry lengere
Have thou not herd a general answer
To all thy matters that thou list to meue
My time draws nere that I must rest
And even therewith he took me by the sleue
And said goo we hens for that should I best
As good is enough as a great fest
Thou have seen enough hold the content
And even with yt forth with him I went
Till he had me brought agene to my bed
where he me found and then pryuely
He stale away I could not understand
where he became but suddenly
As he came he went I tell you verily
which done fro sleep I began to awake
My body all in swet began for to shake
For dread of the sight that I had seen
wenyng to me all had be true
Actuelly done where I had been
That battle hold twene Vice and Vertew
But when I see hit. hit was but a whew
A dreme a fantasy and a thing of naught
To study thereon I had no more thought
Till at the last I began me bethynke
For what cause showed was this vysyon
I knew not wherefore I took pen and ynke
And paper thereof to make mencyon
In writing taking consyderacyon
That no defaute were found in me
whereon accused I ought for to be
For slouthe that I had left hit untold
Neither by mouth nor in remembrance
Put it in writing where thorugh manyfolde
ways of accusaco^n might torn me to greuau^ce
All this I saw as I lay in a trau^ce
But wheder it was with mine ey bodily
Or not in certain god knows and not I
That to dyscerne I purpose not to dele
So large by my will it longs not to me
were hit dreme or vysyon for your own well
All that shall hit read here rad or se
Take thereof the best and let the worst be
Try out the corn clean from the chaff
And then may ye say ye have a sure staff
To stand by at need if ye will it hold
And walk by the way of Virtue his lore
But alwey beware be ye young or old
That your Frewyll ay to Virtue more
Apply than to Vice the easyer may be bore
The burden of the field that ye daily fight
Again your. iii. enemies for all her great might
That is to say the Devil and the Flesh
And also the world with his glosyng chere
which on you looks ever new and fresshe
But he is not as he does apere
Look ye keep you ay out of his daungere
And so the vyctory shall ye obtain
Vice fro you exyled and Virtue in you reyne
And then shall ye have the tryu^phall guerdon
That god reserved to every creature
Above in his celestyall mansyon
Joy and bliss infynyte eternally to endure
whereof we say we would feign be sure
But the way thyderwarde to hold be we loathe
That often sithe causes ye good lord to be wroth
And by our deserte our habytacyon chau^geth
Fro Joy to pain and woo perpetuelly
From his glorious sight thus he us estrau^geth
For our vycyous living thorugh our own folly
wherefore let us pray to that lord of glory
while we in earth be y^ he will give us grace
So us here to guide that we may have a place
According to our Regeneracyon
with heavenly spyrytes his name to mahnyfy
which down descends for our redempcyon
Offryng himself on the cross to his fad on hy
Now benygne Ihesu that boren was of Mary
All that to this vysyon have given her audyence
Grant eternal Joy after thy last sentence
AMEN
