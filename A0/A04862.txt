Good Admonition Or
To al sorts of people this counsel I sing,
That in each ones affair, to take heed's a fair thing.
To the tune of, Magina-cre^.


TO all christian people,
this ditty belongs,
That have the true sense,
of their ears, eyes, and tongues:
If well they do keep it
it will profit them bring,
I give but this Item:
take heed's a fair thing.
Be sure above all things,
that God thou do serve,
That safely from dangers,
does still thee preserve:
Him laud for his mercy,
and praise to him sing,
And of that be not slack:
take heed's a fair thing.
See next that thy parents,
thou love and obey,
Be ruled by their counsels
believe what they say:
If so thou persevere,
in thy tender spring,
Thy age will be blessed:
take heed's a fair thing.
To fawning loose friendship,
see thou do not trust,
Give good words for good words,
for flattery must
With truth strive to wrestle,
but fly thou her sting,
Beware of her lurches:
take heed's a fair thing.
Let not thy kind heart,
make thy credit to crack,
Too prodigal be not,
nor what is fitting lack,
To sheep skin and wax,
see thy hand never cling
In thriuing observe this,
take heed's a fair thing.
Lewd Company see that,
by no means thou keep,
Lest shame with disgrace then
upon thee do creep:
And danger into her
relaps will thee bring,
Give ear to my counsel,
take heed's a fair thing.
Let no tempting harlot
bewitch or entice,
To sell that for lust,
which did cost such a price,
As his that died for thee,
to heaven thee to bring,
If thou will go thither:
take heed's a fair thing.
The second part. To the same tune.


Drink wine but let temperance,
measure thy boule,
Shun vice, and lewd gaming,
if thou love thy soul.
Be just in thy calling,
then consciences sting,
Shall never oppress thee,
take heed's a fair thing.
Uaine-glory and pride,
like the devil from fly,
Foul theft and adultery,
come thou not nigh,
Wrath see thou eschew,
for to murder ^will bring,
Then shameful death follows:
take heed's, etc.
Extortion and covetousness,
see that thou hate,
If that the white path,
thou would tread that is straight,
For the br^^d way in fury,
to hell will thee bring,
And too many find it,
take heed's, etc.
If much thou possessest,
be good to the poor,
Let Charity never,
depart from thy door,
Then fame of thy bounty,
and goodness shall sing,
But if thou (...) other,
take heed's, etc.
Take heed of repining
at other men's good,
Bear patiently losses,
for it is understood,
That who so continues,
his conscience will bring
A peaceable ending,
take heed's, etc.
Delight not in popular
glory as vain,
Like April sunshine,
that's mixed with rain
But keep within compass,
and plenty will bring,
The best of her labors.
take heed's, etc.
Be awefull ore servants,
but not too precise:
Be friendly with friendship,
and friendly him prise,
But if thou in danger
thy self for him bring,
The beggar will catch thee,
take heed's, etc.
Thus doing content
with true peace shall thou find,
And nothing disturb thee,
in body or mind
And after death brings thee,
Where Angels do sing,
Thou shall live for ever.
take heed's a fair thing.
FINIS.
