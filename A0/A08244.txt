The Nightingale: Whose curious Notes are here explained, In a dainty Ditty
sweetly feigned.
To a new and much affected Court Tune.


YOu Gallants that resort
To Hide Park or Totnam Court,
To recreate,
And to elevate
your senses when they are out of date,
Come listen to my Song,
Which does belong
to the Nightingales sweet tongue:
It Is Music rare
To hear this little, pretty, dulcid, dainty Philomel
how she makes the Woods for to ring,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
The Courtiers in their pride,
Walking by the green Wood side,
They do much admire,
When they hear the Quire,
of little Birds whose notes aspire,
Above all the rest,
They fancy best
the Nightingales sweet breast,
For she does strain
Her little pretty, dulcid, dainty, pleasant throat,
with music fit for a King,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.


The Citizens would feign
Hear Philomels sweet strain,
But that they fear
When they come there,
the curious constant Note to hear,
And therefore they refuse
And will not use
the Woods if they can choose,
But yet sometimes,
This little, pretty, dulcid, dainty dilly,
They delight to hear in the Spring,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
The Prentices do stray,
Upon the first of May,
To meet their Loves
In the gay green Groves,
where every one their fancy proves,
And with Loves delight,
From morn till night,
they feed their appetite;
And while they woo
This little, pretty, dulcid, dainty creature,
her music to them does bring,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
The second part. To the same Tune.


THe honest laboring Swain,
To extenuate his pain
When he does plod
To his work abroad,
His Hay, or Corn, or Wood to load,
It does joy his heart,
At Plough or Cart,
to hear the curious part,
Which among the Quire,
This little pretty, dulcid, dainty Quirister
does bear, this delight does bring;
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
The Country Milke-maids sweet,
When they go to milk their Neat,
In a Summers day,
In June or May,
delight to walk in the Meadows gay,
They do think it long,
To hear a Song,
from Philomels sweet tongue,
In April they
Expect this little, pretty, dulcid, dainty bird,
when she first proclaims the Spring,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
Both men and women go,
To the green Wood on a row,
Both old and young
Walk in a throng,
both Lads and Lasses march along,
In a Sympathy,
For company,
with mirth and iollity.
It is not for Nuts,
But to hear this little, pretty, dulcid, dainty Musician
how she makes the Woods for to ring,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
Thus Country, City and Court,
Unto the Woods resort,
To please their minds,
Both Lords and Hin^s,
all sorts according to their kinds,
Walk to take delight,
Both morn and night;
and as they please their sight,
Their ears are pleased,
To hear this little, pretty, dulcid, dainty Messenger
what wished for news she does bring,
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
Iug, jug, jug, jug, sweet, jug, jug, jug, jug,
the Nightingale does sing.
