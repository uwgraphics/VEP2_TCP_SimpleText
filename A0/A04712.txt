The Prologue.
INterpone tuis interdum gaudia curis
Ut possis animo quemues sufferre laborem
Do any of you know what latin is this
Or else would you have, an expositor^m
To declare it in English, per sensum planiorem
It is b^st I speak English, or else with in a whylle
I may percace mine own self, with my latin begile.
The two verses, which I rehersid before
I find writt^n, in the book of Cato the wise
Emongs good precepts, of living a thousand more
Which to follow there, he does all men auise
And they may be Englyshed, breflie in this wise
Emongs thy carful business, use sum time mirth and joy
That no bodilye work, thy wits break or noye.
For the mind (says he) in serious matters occupied
If it have not sum quiet mirthe, and recreacion
Interchaungeable admixed, must niddes be sone weried
And (as who should say) tried, through continual operacion
Of labor and business, without relaxacion
Therefore intermix honest mirthe, in such wise
That your stre^ght may be refreshid, and to labors suffis^
For as meat and drink, natural rest and sleep
For the cons^ruacion, and hel^h of the body
Must niddes be had, so the mind and wits to keep
Pregnant, fresh industruis, quike and instie
Honest mirthe, and pastime, is requisite and necessary
For, Quod caret alterna re quie du^ abile non est
Nothing may endure (says Ouyd) with out sum rest.
Example, proof her of in earth is well found
Manifest open and verie^ evident
For except the husbandman suffer his ground
Sum times to rest, it wol bear no fruit verament
Therefore they let the filde lie, every second year
To the end that after rest, it may the better corn bear.
Thus than (as I have said) it is a thing natural
And naturally belonging to all living creatures
And unto man especially, above others all
To have at times convenient pastau^ce, mirthe, and pleasurs
So they be joined with honesty, and keapt with in due measurs
And the same well allowed not only the said Cato
But also ye Pyilosophers, Plutarke, Socrates and Plato
And Cicero Tullius, a man sapient and wise
wills the same, in that his first book
Which he wrote, and e^tytulid, of an honest man's office
Who so is disposid thereupon to look
Where to def^^e, and offirme, he boldly on him took
That to here Enterluds, is pastim^ convenient
For all manner men, and a thing congruent.
He rekeneth that namely, as a very honest disport
And above al other things, commends ye old co^medie
The hearing of which, may do the mind c^mfort
For they be replenished with precepts of Philosophy
The contain mutch wisdom and teach prudent pollecie
and though they be al written of mattiers of non i^portau^ce
Yet the show great wit, and mutch pretty conu^iaunce.
And in this manner of making, Plautus did ^xcell
As records the same Tullius commending him by name
Wherefore this maker deliteth passinglye well
Too follow his arguments, and draw out the same
For to make at seasuns co^u^nie^t pastims mirth and game
As now he has do^ this matter not worth an oyster shel
Except percace it shall furtune too make you laugh well
And for that purpose only this maker did it write
Taking the ground thereof out of Plautus first co^medie
And the first scentence of ye same for higher things endite
In no wise he would, for yet the time is so ques^e
That he that speaks best, is lest thank worthy
Therefore, since noting but trifles may be had
you shall here a thing yt only shall make you merry and glad.
And such a trifling matter as when it shall be done
Ye may report and say ye have heard nothing at all
Therefore I tell you all, before it be begone
That no man look to hear of matters substancyall
Nor mattiers of any grauitee either great or small
For this mak^r showed us that such manner things
Do never well besime little boys handelinges.
wherefore if ye will not sowrelie your broues bend
At such a fantastical conceit as this
But can be content to hear and see the end
I woll go show the Players what your pleasure is
Which to wait upon you I know be ready or this
I woll goo send them hither in too your presence
Desiryng that they may have quiet audience.
Iake Iugler. OUr lord of Heaven and sweet saint Ihone
Rest you merye my maist^rs euerychone
And I pray to Christ and sweet saint Steu^n
Send you all many a good euine
And you to sir, and you, and you also
Good euine to you an hundred times and a thousand mo
Now by all these crosses of flesh bone and blod
I reckine my chance right maruaylus good
Here now to find all this company
Which in my mind I wyshed for hartylie
For I have labored all day till I am werie
And now am disposed too pass the time, and be merry
And I think noon of you, but he would do the same
For who wol be sad, and nedithe not, is ^o^le to blame
And as for me, of my mother I have been tought
To be merry when I may, and take no thought
Which leasone, I bare so well away
That I use to make merye oons a day
And now if all things happyn right
You shall see as mad a pastime this night
As you saw this seven yers? and as propre a joy
As ever yon saw played of a toye
I am called Iake Iugler, of many an oon
And in faith I woll play a iugling cast a non
I woll cunger the moull, and god before
Or else leat me l^se my name for evermore
I have it devised, and compas^ed hou
And what ways, I woll tell and show to you
you all know well Master Boungrace
The gentilman that dwellith here in this place
And Ienkine Carreawaie, his page as cursed a lad
And as ungracious as ever man had
An unhappy wage, and as folishe a knave with all
As any is now, within London wall
This Ienkine and I been fallen at great debate
For a mattier, that fell betwine us a late
And hitherto of him I could never revenged be
For his master mantaineth hi^, and loves not me
Albe it the very truth to tell
Another of the^ both, knows me not very well
But against al other boys, the said gentle man
Maynteyneth him, all that he can
But I shall set little by my wit
If I do not Ienkine this night requite
Ere I sleep Ienkine shall be mete
And I trust to cume partlye out of his dete
And when we mete again, if this do not suff^^e
I shall pay Ienkine the residue, in my best wise
It chanced me right now in the other end of ye n^xt stret
With Ienkine and his master, in the face to met
I aboed there a whylle, playng for to see
At the Buklers, as welbe commed m^e
It was not long time, but at the last
Bake cumithe my cos^ne Careawaie, homward full fast
Pricking, Praunsing, and springynge in his short cote
And pleasantly synginge, with a merry note
Whyther a way so fast, tarry a while said oon
I cannot now said Ienkine, I must nides be goon
My master suppeth herbye, at a gentylmans place
And I must thither feache my dame, maistres bou^grace
But yet er I go, I care not motche
At the bukelers to play, with thee oon fair toche
To it they went, and played so long
Till Ienkine thought he had wrong
By cokes prceious potstike, I will not home this night
Quod he, but as good a stripe oon thie head light
Within half an hour, or sum what lose
Ienkine left playng, and went to featche his maisteris
But by the way he met with a Freuteres wife
There Ienkine and she fell at such strife
For snatching of an Apple, that down he cast
Her basket, and gatherid up the apples fast^
And put them in his sleue, the^ came he his way
By an other lane, as fast as he may
till he came at a corner, by a shoops stall
Where boys were at Dice, faryng at all
When Careawaie with that good cumpany met
He fell to faryng, withouten let
Forgettyng his message, and so well did he fare
that when I came ^ye, he began swear and stare
And full bitt^rlye, began to curse
As oone that had lost, almost all in his purse
For I know his old gise, and condition
Never to leave, till all his money be goon
For he has no money, but what he does stell
And that woll he play, a way every dell^
I passed by, and then called unto my mind
Sartayde old rekeaninges, that were behynd
Bitwen Ienkine and me, who^ partly to recompense
I trust by gods grace, ^re I goo hence
This garments, cape, and all other geare^
That now you see, upon me here
I have done oon, all like unto his
For the nons, and my purpose is
To make Ienkine, byliue if I can
That he is not him self, but an other man
For except he has better look, than he had
He woll cum hither, stark staryng mad
When he shall cum, I wol handle my captine so
Than he shall not well wot, whether too goo
His Maisteris I know, she w^ll him blame
And his Master also, will do the same
Because that she, of her supper deceived is
For I am sure they have all supped by this
But and if Ienkine, would hither resort
I trust he and I, should make sum sport
If I had sooner spokine, he would have sooner been here
For my simithe, I do his voice hear.

Careawaye. A sir I may say, I have been at a fest
I have lost.ii. s^and sir pence at the ^est
Mary sir, of this gaynes I nyde make no bost
But the dyuell goo with all, more have I lost
My name is Careawaie, let all sorrow pass
I woll ere too morrow night be as rich as ever I was
Or at ye forthest within a day or twain
Me Masters purst, shall pay me again
Therefore hogh careawaie, now wol I sig^ hei he^
But by ye lord now I remember a another thing
By my faith Ienkine my Maisteris and thou
At like to gree, god knows hou
That thou come not, for her incontinent
To bring her to supper, when thou were sent
And now they have all supped, thou wolt shurlie abye
Except thou imagine, sumpretie and craftye lie
For she is as all other weomen be
A very cursed shrew, by the blessid Trinity.
And a very Dyuell, for if she oons begyne
To fight, or chyde, in a weke she wol not line
And a great pleasure she has, specially now of late
To get poor men, now and then by the pate
For she is an angrye piece of flesh, and sone displeased
Quikely moved, but not lyghtlye appesed
We use to call her at home, dame Coye
A pretty gingerlie pice, god save her and saint Loye
As denty and nice, as an halpeny worth of silver spoons
But vengeable melancholy, in the after noons
She uses for her bodylie health, and safe guard
To chyd daily oone fite, too supperward
And my Master himself, is worse then she
If he ons throughlye angeryd be
And a maid we have at home, Aulsoon tripe and goo
Not all London can ^hewe, such other two
She simperith, she prankith and gets with out faylle
As a pecocke that has spread, and shows her gaye tail
Se minceth, she brideleth, she swimmeth to and fro
She tredith not one here a wrye, she tryppeth like a do
A broad in the street, going or cumming homward
She quauerith, and ward^lith, like one in a galiard
Every joint in her body and every part
Oh it is a ioylie wenche to myns and deuyd a fart
She talks, she chatteth like a Pie all day
And speaks like a parat Poppagaye
And that as fine, as a small silken threede
Ye and as high as an Eagle can fle for a neade
But it is a spitfull lying girl, and never well
But when she may sum ill ta^l by me tell
She woll I warrant you, a non at the first
Of me immagine, and say the worst.
And what soever she to my maisteris does say
It is written in the gosspell of the same day
Therefore I woll here with my self devise
What I may best say, and in what wise
I may excuse this my long taryeng
That she of my negligence may suspect n^thyng
For if the fault of this be found in me
I may give my life for halpenis three
Hic cogitab^ndo similis sedeat.
Let me ^lodie this month, and I shall not fiend
A b^lt^r devise then now is cume to my mind
Maistries woll I say, I am bound by my duty
To see that your womanhod have no injury
For I hear and see, more then you now and then
And your self partly know the want in wyles of men
When we came yender, there did I see
My master kiss gentilwomen tow or three
And to come emongs others my thought bysye
He had a myruayllus great phantasye
A non he commaundyd me to run thens for you
To cume supe there if you would but I wot not how
My heart grudgid mistrusting lest that I being away
My master would sum light cast play
Where upon maistries, to se the end
I tarried half supper time so god me mende
And besides that there was such other compainye
As I know your maistrisship sets nothing by
Gorges daines of the corte and galaunts also
with doctors, and other rufflers mo
At last when I thought it time and seasune
I came too certify you as it was reasune
And by the way whom should I mete
But that most honest Gentilman in the stret
Which the last wike was with you here
And made you a banquet, and bouncing cheer
Ah Ienkin quod he good spid how farest thou
Mary well god yld it you m^^ster quod I how do you
How does thy maisteris is she at home
Ye sir quod I and suppeth all a lone
And but she has no manner good chere
I am sure she would gladlye have you there
I cannot cum now said he I have business
But thou shall carry a tokine from me to thy maistreis
Goo with me too my chaumbre at yone lane end
And I woll a dishe of costerds unto her send
I folowid him, and was bold by your leave
To receive and bring them here in my sleue
But I would not for all England by Ihesu Christ
That my master Boungrace hereof wist
Or knew that I should any such gear to you bring
Lest he misdeme us both in sum worse thing
Nor show him nothing of that I before said
For then in did sir I am arrayed
If you do I may nothing herafter unto you tell
whether I se mi master do ill or well
That if you now this counsel keep
I wol ease you parchaunce twice in a wike
you may say you were sike and your head did ache
that you lu^^ed not ^his night any supper make
Specially with out the doors but thought it best
too abide at home and take your rest
And I will to my master too bring him home
For you know he wolbe angry if he come alone
this most I say and fa^e it so well
That she shall believe it every dell
Hou say you frinds, by the arms of Robyn hood
Wol not this excuse be reasonable good
To muse for any beeter, great folly it is
For I may make sure reke^ning of this
That and if I would sit sto^ing this.vii. year
I shall not else find how to save me all clear
And as you see ^or the most part our wits be best
When we be takyne most vnrediest
But I wol not give for that boy a fly
That has not al times in store one good lie
And cannot set a good face upon the same
Therefore saint Gorge y^ boroue, as it wol let him frame
I woll ieopard a joint, be^ as be may
I have had many like chances, before this day
But I promise you I do curstlie fear
For I feel a vengeable burning in my left ere
And it has been a saying, of time long
That sweet mete woll have sour sauce among
And surely I shall have sum ill hape
For my here standith up under my cape
I would knock but I dare not by our lady
I fear hanging where unto no man is hasty
But seeing there is no another remedy
Thus to stand any longer it is but folly.
Hic pulset ostium.
They be so far with in, the cannot hear

Jack Iugler. Soft thy knoking saucie knave, what make thou there

Ienkene Careawaie. What knave is that? he speaks not too me I trow
And we mete the one of us is like to have a blow
For now that I am well chafed, and sumwhat hot
twentye such could I hew as small as flesh to rote
And surely if I had a knyfe
This knave should escape hardelye with his life
To teach him to ask of me any more
What I make at my own maistirs door

Jack Iugler But if thou come from that gate thou knave
I woll fet thee by the swet looks so god me save

Ienkine Careawaie Woll the horesoon fight in deed by mine honesty
I know no quarrel he has too me
But I would I were with in the house
And then I would not set by him a louse
For I fear and mistrust such quareling thiues
See how he beginnith to strike up his fleues

Jack iugler His arse makith buttens now, and who lustith to feale
Shall find his heart creping out at his heel
Or else lying hiden in sum corner of his hose
If it be not alredie dropped out of his nose
For as I doubt not but you have hard beforne
A more dastard couerd knave was never borne

Ienkin Careawaie The devil set the house a fire, I trow it is a curste
When a man ^ath most have he spedith worst
If I be robed, or slain, or any harm geate
The fault is in them that does not me in let
And I durst ieoperd, an hunderi^d pound
That sum bauderie might now within be found
But except sum of them come the sooner
I shall knock such a peale, that al england shall wo^^er

Iake iugler Knoke at the gate hardelye again if thou dare
And seeing thou wolt not bye fair words beware
Now fistes, me thinks yesterdaye.vii. yers past
That four men a sleep at my fete you cast
And this same day you did no manner good
Nor were not washen in warm blod

Ienkin Careawaie What whoreson is this that washith in warm blod
Sum devil broken loose, out of hell for wood
Four has he slain, and now well I see
That it must be my chance the fifth to be
But rather then thus shamfullye too be slain
would Christ my friends had hanged me being but yers.ii
And yet if I take good heart and be bold
Percace he wolbe more sobre and could

Iake iugler Now hands bestur you about his lyppes and face
And streake out all hi^ teth without any grace
Gentelma^ are you disposed to ear any fist mete

Ienkin Careawaye I have supped I thank you sir and list not to eat
Give it to them that are haungrie if you be wise

Jack iugler. Yet shall do a man of your d^et no harm to suppe twice
This shall be your Chise, to make your merdigest
For I tell you these hands weighith of the best

Ienkin Careawaye I shall never escape see how he waghith his hands

Jack iugler with a stroke they will lay a (...) in our lady b^an^
And this day yet they have done no g^^d at all

Ienkine Car^awaye Ere you assaye the^ on me, I pray thee lame the^ on ye wall
But speak you all this in earnest, or in game
If yo^ be angry with me truly you are to blame
For have you any just quarrel to me

Iake iugler Eer thou and I part that wol I show thee

Ienkin Careawaye Or have I done you any manner displeasure

Iake iugler Ere thou and I part thou shall know, y^ may besure

Ienkin Careawaye By my faith if thou be angry without a cause
You shall have a mendes made with a cople of straus
By thee I set what soever thou art
But for thy displeasure I care not a farte
May a man demand whose servant you be

Jack iugler My masters servant I am for verity

Ienkin Careawaye what busynes have you at this place now

Jack iugler Nay mary tell me what busynes have thou
For I am commanded for to watch and give diligence
That in my good master Boungraces absence
No misfortune may happen to his house sertayne

Ienkin Careawaye well now I am cume, you may go hens again
And thank them yt so much for my master has done
Sewing them yt the servants of y^ house be cume home
For I am of the house, and now in woll I goo

Jack iugler I cannot tell whether thou be of the house or no
But goo no nere, lest I handle thee like a strainger
Thank no man but thy self, if thou be in any danger

Ienkine Careawaye Marye I defye thee, and planly unto thee tell
That I am a servant of this house, and here I dwell

Jack iugler Now so god me snache, but thou goo thee ways
Whille thou may, for this forty d^yes
I shall make thee not able to goo nor ride
But in a dungcart or a whilberow liyng on on side

Ienken Careawaie I am a servant of this house by these.x. bons

Jack iugler No more prating but geat thee hens at towns

Ienkin Careawaye Why my master has sent me home in his message

Jack iugler Pike and walk a knave, here a way is no passage

Ienkin Careawaie What will thou let me from my nowne maistirs house

^Iacke iugler Be tredging, or in faith you ^ere me a souse
Here my master and I have our habitacion
And has continually dwelled in this mansyon
At the least this doos^n yers and od
And here wol we end our lives by the grace of god

Ienkin Careawaye Why then where shall my master and I dwell

Jack iugler At the Dyuell if you lust, I can not tell

Ienken Careawaye In nomine patris, now this gear does pass
For a litel before supper here our house was
And this day in ye morning I wol on a book swer
That my master and I both dwelleyd here

Iake iugler Who is thy master tell me with out lie
And thine own name also let me know shortly
For my masters all, let me have the blame
If this knave kno his master or his own name

Caerawaye My masters name is master Boungrace
I have dwelled with him a long space
And I am ienkin Careawaye his page

Iake iugler. What ye drunkin knave begin you to rage
Take that, art thou master Boungracis page

Careawaie If I be not, I have made a very good viage

Jack iugler. Dare thou too my face say thou art I

Careawaye I would it were true and no lie
For then thou sholdest smart, and I should bet
Where as now I do all the blows get

Jack iugler And is master Boungrace thy master do y^ ^hen say

Careawaye I woll swear on a book, he was ons this day

Jack iugler And for that thou shall sum what have
Beca^se thou presumest, like a saucye lying knave
To say my master is thine? who is thy master now?

Careawaie. By my truth sir who so ever please you
I am your own, for you beat me so
As no man but my master should do

Iake iugler I woll handle thee better if faut be not in fyst

Careawaie Help save my life masters for ye passion of christ

Jack iugler Why thou lowsy thief do thou cry and rare

Careawaye No faith I woll not cry one whit more
Save my life help, or I am slain

Jack iugler Ye do thou make a romeringe yet a gain
Did not I bide the hold thy peace

Careawaie In faith now I leave crieng, now I sease help, help,

Jack iugler Who is thy master

Careawaye Master Boungrace

Jack iugler I woll make the chaung ye song, ere we pas this place
For he is my master, and a gain to see I say
That I am his ienkin Careawaye
Who art thou now tell me plain

Careawaye No body, but whom please you sertayne

Jack iugler Thou saydest even now thy name was Careawaie

Careawaye I cry you marcy sir, and forgiveness pray
I said a mysse because it was so too day
And thought it should have continued always
Like a fool as I am and a dronken knave
But in faith sir ye se all the wit I have
Therefore I beseech you do me no more blame
But give me a new master, and an other name
For it would grieve my heart so help me god
To run about the streets like a maisterlis nod

Iake iugler I am he that thou saydest thou were
And master boungrace is my master yt dweleth hear
thou art no point Careawaye thy wits do thee faylle

Careawaye Ye mary sir you have bette them down into my taylle
But sir might I be bold to say on thing
Without any bloues, and without any beatynge

Iake iugler Truce for a while say one what thy lust

Careawaye May a man too your honest by your word trust
I pray you swear by the mass you woll do me no ill

jack iugler By my faith I promise pardone thee I woll

Careawaye What and you keep no promise. Ia iugler, then upon ca^
I pray god light as much or more as has on y^ to day

Careawaye Now dare I speak so mote I thee
Master boungrace is my master, and the name of me
is ienken careaway, jack iugler. What say thou so

careawaye And if thou will strike me, and break thy promise, do
And beat on me, till I stink, and till I dye
And yet woll I still say that I am I

jack iugler This bedlem knave without dought is mad

Careawaye No by god for all that I am a wise lad
And can cale to rememberaunce every thing
That I did this day, sith my vprisynge
For went not I with my master to day
Erly in the morning to the Tenis play?
At noone while my master at his dynner sat
Played not I at Dice at the gentylmans gate
Did not I wait on my master to supper ward
And I think I was not changed y^ way ho^ward
Or else if thou think I lie
Ask in the stret of them that I came bye
And since that I came hither into your presens
what man living could carye me hens
I remember I was sent to fetch my maisteris
And what I devised to save me harmeles
Do not I speak now is not this my hand
Be not these my feet yt on this ground stand?
Did not this other knave her knoke me about ye head?
And beat me till I was almost deed?
How may it then be, that he should be I?
Or I not my self it is a shamfull lie
I woll home to our house, whosoever say nay
For surely my name is ienkin Careawaye

Jack Iugler. I wol make thee say otherwise ere we depart if we can

Ienkin Careawaye Nay that woll I not in faith for no man
Except thou tell me what I thou have done
Ever sith five of the cloak this after noon:
Rehearse me all that with out any lie
And then I woll confess that thou art I

Jack iugler When my master came to the gentylma^s place
He commanded me too rune home a great pace
Too fet thither my maisteris and by the way
I did a good while at the bukelers play
Then came I by a wife that did costerds sell
And cast down her basket fair and well
And gathered as many as I could get
And put them in my sleue here they be yet

Careawaie How the devil should they cume there
For I did them all in my own sleue bear
He l^eth not a word in all this
Nor does in any one point myse
For ought I se yet between erneste and game
I must go sike me a another name
But thou might see all this, tell the rest that is behind
And there I know I shall thee a liar find

Jack iugler I ran thence homeward a contrary way
And wheth^r I stoped there or nay
I could tell if me lusts a good token
But it may not very well be spoken

Ienkin Careawaye No may I pray thee let no man that here
But tell it me priuelye in mine ere

Jack iugler I thou lost all thy money at dice christ give it his curse
well and truly pycked before out of an other ma^s p^rse

Ienken Careawaie Gods body horeson thief who told thee that same
Sum cunning devil is with in thee pain of shame
In nomine patris, god and our blessed lady
Now and evermore save me from thy cumpanye

Jack iugler How now art thou Careawaye or not

Careawaye By the lord I doubt, but say thou nay to that

Jack iugler. Ye mary I tell thee care away is my name

Careawaye And by these tene bones mine is the same
Or else tell me if I be not he
What my name from hensforth shall be

jack iugler By my faith the same that it was before
When I lust too be Careawaye no more
Look well upon me, and thou shall see as now
That I am ienkyne Careawaye and not thou
Look well a pon me, and by every thing
Thou shall well know that I make no leasing.

Careawaye I se it is so without any doubt
But how the dyuell came it a boute
W^o so in England lokethe on him stedelye
Sall perceive plainlye that he is I
I have seen my self a thousand times in a glass
But so like myself as he is never was
He has in every point my clothing and mi gear
My head, my cape, my shirt and notted hear
And of the same color, my yes, nose and lyppes
Much (...) nea^e, feet, leges, and hippes
Of the same statute, and hight and age
And is in every point master Boungrace page
That if he have a hole in his tail
He is even I mine own self without any fail
And yet when I remember I wot not how
The same man yt I have ever bine me thinkith I am now
I know mi master, and his house, and my five wits I have
Why then should I give credence to this folishe knave
That nothing entendith but me delude and mooke
For whom should I fear at my masters gate to knoke

Jack iugler Think t^ou I have said all this in game
Goo or I shall send the hens in the dyuills name
A void thou lousye lurden and precious stinking slave
that n^ther thy name know nor can any master have
wine shakin, pilorye peepours, of lice not without a pecke
Hens or by gods precious I shall break thy neck

Careawaye Then master I besiche you hartylye take the pain
If I be found in any place too bring me to me again
Now is not this a wonderful case
That no man should lease him self so in any place
Have any of you hard of such a thing here to fore
No nor never shall I dare say from hensforth any more

Jack iugler while he museth an judges him self upon
I wo^l stele a way for a while and let him a loon

Careawaie Good lord of heuine, where did I my self leave
Or who did me of my name by the way bereue
For I am sure of this in my mind
That I did in no place leave my self byhinde
If I had my name played a way at dyce
Or had sold my self to any man at a price
Or had made a fray and had lost it in fyghtyng
Or it had byne stolen from me sleaping
It had byne a matter and I would have kept patience
But it spiteth my heart to have lost it by such open negligence
Ah thou horesone drousie drunken sote
Yt were an alms did to walk thy cote
And I shrew him that would for thee be sorye
Too see thee well curryed by and by
And by Christ if any man would it do
I my self would help there too
For a man may see thou horesone goose
Thou would lyse thine arse if it were loose
Albeit I would never the did believe
But that the thing it self does show and pryue
There was never Ape so like unto an Ape
As he is to me in feature, and shape
But what woll my master say trow ye
When he shall this gear here and see
Will he know me think yo^, when he shall se me
If he do not a another woll as good as he
But where is that other I? whether is he gone
To my master by cock^s precius passion
Either to put me out of my place
Or too accuse me to my master Boungrace
But I woll after as fast as I can flee
I trust to be there as soon as he
That if my master be not redye home to come
I woll be here again as fast as I can rune
I^ any wise to speak with my maysteris
Or else I shall never escape hanging dubtles

Dame Coye I shall not suppe this night full well I see
For as yet no body ^umithe for to fet me^
But good enough let me alone
I woll be even with them every chone
I say nothing, but I think sum what I wis
Sum there be that shall here of this
Of al unkind and churlishe husbands this is ye cast
To let there wives se^ at home and fast
While they be forth and make good cheer
Pastime, and sport, as now he does there
But if I were a wise woman, as I am a mome
I should make my self as good chere at home
But if he have thus vnkindlye served me
I woll not forget it this monethis three
And if I west ye fault were in him, I pray god I be ded
But he should have such a kyrie, ere he went too bed
As he never had before in all his life
Nor any man else have had of his wy^e
I would rate him and shake him after such a sort
As should be to him a corrasiue, full little to his cumforte
A^^s trippe and goo If I may be so bold by your ma^sterishps lyeens
As too speak and show my mind and sentence
I think of this you may the boy thank
For I know that he plays you many a like pranke
And that would you say, if you knew as mu^ch as we
That his daily conversation and byhauiore s^e
For if you comm^^^d him to goo speak with sum one
Yt is an hour ere he wolbe gone
Then woll he rune forth, and play in the street
And cume a gain and say that he cannot with him mete

Dame Coye Nay, nay, it is his masters play
He seruithe me so almost every third day
But I wolbe even with him as god give me joy
And yet the fault may be^ in the boy
As ungracious a graft^^ met I thrive
As any goes on gods g^^^^d a^yue

Careawaye: My wit is breched insuche a brake
That I cannot devise what way is best to take
I was almost as fare as my master is
But then I begane to remember ^his
And to cast the worst as on in ^ere
^f he chance to see me and keep me there
Til he cum him self, and speak with mi masteris
Than am I like to be in shrewd dystres
yet were I better thought I to turn hom again
And first speak with her certain
Cocks body yonder she stands at the door
Now is it wourse then it was before
Would christ I could get again out of her sight
For I see be her look she is disposid to fight
By ye lord she has there an angry shrewes love

Dame coye Lo yender cumithe that unhappy hook

Careawaye God save you maysteris do you know me well

Dame coye Cume nere hither unto me, and I shall thee tell
Why thou noughtie vyllan is that thy gyse
To gest with thy maisteris in such wise
take that to begyne with, and god before
when thy master cumith home thou shall have more
For he told me when he forth went
That thou should cume bake a gain inconfinente
To bring me to supper where he now is
And thou have played by the way, and they have don by this
But no force I shall thou may trust me
Teach all naughty knaves to beware by thee

Careawaye For sothe maisteris if you knew as much as I
ye would not be with me half so angry
For the fault is neither in mi master nor in me nor you
But in an other knave that was here even now
And his name was ienkin Careawaie

Dame coye What I see my man is disposid to play
I wine he be dronken or mad I make god a vou

Careawaie Nay I have been made sobre and tame I now
I was never so handelid before in all my life
I would every man in England had so beat me his wife
I have forgotten with tousing by the here
What I devised to say a little ere

Dame coye Have I lost my supper this night through thy negligence

Careawaye Nay then were I a knave mysteries, saving your reverence

Dame coye Why I am sure that by this time it is done

Careawaye Ye that it is more then an our agone

Dame coye And was not thou sent-to feache me theyth^r

Careawaye Yes and had cume right quiklie hither
But that by the way I had a great fall
And my name, body shape legs and all
And meat with one, that from me did it ^^elle
But be god he and I sum bloues did deal
I would he were now before your gate
For you would poumile him ioylile about the pate

Dame Coye Truly this wage ^astie is either drunken or mad

Careawaye Never man soffred so mutche wrong as I had
But maisteris I should say a thing to you
Tarry it wol cum to my remembrence even now
I must nidd^s use a substanciall premeditacion
For the matter lies gretylie me a pon
I besiche your maisterishipe of pardon and forgiveness
Desyering you to impute it to my simple and rude dul^nes
I have forgotten what I have thought to have said
And am thereof full ill a paid
But when I lost my self I knew very well
I lost also that I should you tell

Dame Coye Why thou wrechid villen do thou me scorn and moke
To make me to these folk a laufyng stock
Ere thou go out of my hands y^ shall have sum thing
And I woll rekine better in the morning

Careawaie. And if you beat me maysteris a vise you
For I am none of your servant now
That other I is now your page
And I am no long^r in your bondage

Dame Coye Now walk precious thife get thee out of my sight
And I charge thee cum in my presens no more this night
Get thee hens and wait on thy master at ons

Careawaie Mary sir this is handeling for the noons
I would I had been hanged before y^ I was lost
I was never this canuased and tossed
That if my master on his part also
Handle me as my maisteris and the other I do
I shall surely be killed bitwine them three
And all the devils in hell shall not save me
But yet if the other I might have with me part
All this would never grieve my heart

Jack iugler Hou say you masters I pray you tell
Have not I requited my marchent well
Have not I handelyd him after a good sort
Had it not byne pytie to have lost this sport
A none his master on his behalphe
You shall see how he woll handle the calphe
if he throughlye angered be
He woll make him smart so mot I thee
I would not for the price of a new pair of shone
That any part of this had bynne vndune
But now I have reu^nged my quarrel
I woll go do of this mine apparel
And now let Careawaye be Careawaye again
I have done with that name now certain
Exc^pt perauenture I shall take the self same wede
Sum other time again for a like cause and need

Boungrace Why then darist thou to presume too tell me
That I know is no wise possible for to be

Careawaye Now by my truth master I have told you no lie
And all these folks knowith as well as I
I had nosooner knoked at the gate
But straight ways he had me by the pate
Therefore if you bet me till I fart and shyt again
you shall not cause me for any pain
But I woll affirm as I said before
That when I came nere a another stood at ye door.

Boungrace Why ye naughtye villain dare yt affirm to me
that which was never seen nor hereafter shall be
That one man may have too bodies and two faces
And yt one man at on time may be in too plaeis
Tell me drankest thou any where by the way

Careawaie I shreue me if I dra^ke any more the^ twice to day
Till I met even now with that other I
And with him I supped and drank truly
But as for you if you gave me drink and meat
As oftentimes as you do me beat
I were the best fed page in all this City
But as touching that, you have on me no pitye
And not only I but all that do you sarue
For meat and dry^ke may rather starve

Boungrace What you saucye malyp^rt knane
Begine you with your master to prat andraue
your tongue is lyberall and all out of frame
I must niddes coung^r it and make it tame
where is ye other Careawai ^ thou said was here

Careawaye Now by my chrystendome sir I wo^t nere

Boungrace Why can thou find no man to moke but me

Careawaye I moke you not master so mo^ I thee
Every word was true that I you told

Boungrace Nay I know toys and pranke of old
And now thou art not satisfied nor content
Without regard of my biddinges and commau^diment
To have played by the way as a leude know and negligent
When I thee on my message home sent
But also would willinglye me delude and moke
And make me to all wise men a laughyng stoke
showing me such things as in no wise be may
To ye intent thy leudues may turn to jest and play
Therefore if you speak any such thing to me agai^e
I promise it shall be unto thy pain

Careawaye Loo is not he in miserable ca^e
That sarueth such a master in any place
that with force wol compel him ye thing to deny
That he knows true, and has sine with his ye

Boungrace Was it not troiest thouthine own shadoe

Careawaye My shadoo could never have beten me so

Boungrace Why by what reason possible may such a thing be

Careawaye Nay I maruael and wonder at it more than ye
And at the first it did me curstelye mea^e
Nor I would mine own yes in no wise belyue
Untyll that other I beat me so
That he made me beliue it whither i would or no
And if he had your self now within his reach
He would make you say so too or else be shite your breach

Master Boungrace I durst a good mede, and a wager lay
That thou laiest down and sleppest by the way
And ^remidall this that thou haste me told

Careawaie Day there you lie master if I might be so bold
But we rise so erlye that if I had
I had done well and a wise ladde
yet master I would you under stood
That I have all ways been trusty and good
And fly as fast as a bear in a cage
When so ever you send me in your message
in faith as for this that I have told you
I saw and felt it as waking as I am now
For I had no sooner knocked at the gate
But the other I knave had me by the pate
And I durst to you one a book swear
That he had been watching for me there
Long ere I came hyden in sum pryuye place
Even for the nons too have me by the face

Master boungrace Why then thou speak not with my wife

Careawaye No that I did not mai^ter by my life
Untyll that other I was gone
And then my maister^s sent me after a no^e
To weight on you home in the dyuelles name
I wene the dyuell never so beat his dame

Master boungrace And where became that other Careawaye

Careawaye By mine honesty sir I cannot say
But I warrant he is now not far hens
He is here among this cumpany for.xl. pens

Master boungrace Hence at tonce sike and smell him out
I shall rape thee on the lying knanes snought
I woll not be deludyd with such a glosing lie
Nor give credens till I see it with my oune iye

Careawaie. Truly good sir by your maistershipps favor
I cannot well find a knave by the sauoure
Many here smell strong but none so rank as he
A stronger sented knave then he was cannot be
But sir if he be happelye found anon
What a me^ds shall I have for yt you have me don

Master boungrace If he may befound I shall walk his cote

Careawaie Ye for our ladi sake sir I bisiche you spare hi^ not
For it is sum false knave withouten doubt
I had rath^r the^.xl. pens we could find him out
For if a man may beliue a glase
Euin my very oune self it was.
And here he was but even right now
And steped a way sodenlie I wat not how
Of such a other thing I have nether hard ne seen
By our blyssyd lady heaven q^ene

Master boungrace Plainelye it was thy shadow that thou did se
For in faith the other thing is not possible to be

Careawaye Yes in good faith sir by your leave
I know it was I by my apples in my sleue
And speakith as like me as ever you hard
Such here, such a Cape, such Hose and cote
And in eueri thing as just as.iiii. pens to a grot
That if he were here you should well see
That you could not discern nor know hi^ from me
For think you that I do not my self know
I am not so folishe a knave I trow
Let who woll look him by and by
And he woll depose upon a book that he is I
And I dare well say you woll say the same
For he called him self by my own name
And told me all that I have done
Since five of the cloak this after none
He could tell when you were to supper sete
you send me home my maisteris to fete
And showed me al things that I did by ye way

Boungrace What was that

Careawaie How I did at the Bukelers play
And wha^ I scaterid a basket of apples from a ^^al
And gethered them into my sleue all
And how I played after that also

Boungrace Thou shall have by therefore so mote I go
Is that the guise of a trusty page
To play when he is sent on his masters message

Dame coye Lay on and spare not for the love of christ
Ioll his head to a post, and favor your fyste
Now for my sake sweet heart spare and favor your hand
and lay him^ about the rybbes with this wande

Careawaye Now marcy that I ask of you both twain
Save my life and let me not be slain
I have had beting enough for one day
That a mischife take the other me Careawayne
That if ever he cume to my hands again
I wis it shall be to his pain
But I maruayll greatly by our lord Ihesus
How he I escapid, I me beat me thus
And is not he I an unkind knave
That woll no more pytie on my self have
Here may you see, euidentlye ywis
That in him me no drope of houestie is
Now a ^^ngau^ce light on such a churles knave
That no more love toward my self have

Dame coye I knew very well swite heart and said right now
That no fault thereof should be in you

Boungrace No truly good h^dfelow, I were then mutch unkind
if you at any time should be out of my mind

Dame Coye Surely I have of you a great treasure
For you do all things which may be to my pleasure

Boungrace I am sorry that your chance has now byne so ill
I would gladly byne vnsupped, so you had your fill
But goo we in pigesnie that you may suppe
you bane cause now to thank this same hang up
For had not he byne you had faryd very well

Dame Coye I bequeth him with a hot vengaunce to the devil of hell
And hartelye I besiche him that hanged on the rode
That he never eat nor drink, that may do him good
And that he dye a shameful death saving my cheryte

Careawaie I pray god send him such prosperity
That has caused me to have all this business
But yet syrs you see the charity of my maistris
She lives after a wonderful cheritable facion
For I assure you she is always in this passion
And scacelye on day throughout the hole year
She woll wyshe any man better chere
And sum time if she well angered be
I pray god (woll she say) y^ house may sink under me
But masters if you happen to see that other I
As that you shall it is not very likelye
Nor I woll not desire you for him purposelye to look
For it is an vncomperable unhappy hook
And if it be I, you might happin to seek
And not find me out in an hole week
For when I was wont to rune a way
I used not to cum a gain in less tha^ a month or tway
Houbeit for all this I think it be not I
For to show the matter in did truly
I never use to rune away in winter nor in vere
But all ways in such time and season of the year
When honye lies in the hiues of Bees
And all manner fruit falls from the trees
As Apples, Nuttes, Peers, and plummes also
Whereby a boy may live a brod a month or two
This cast do I use I woll not with you feign
Therefore I wonder if he be I sertaine
But and if he be, and you mete me a brod by chance
Send me home to my waister with a vengaunce
And show him if he cume not ere to morrow night
I woll never receive him again if I might
And in the mean time I woll give him a grote
That woll well and thryftelye walk his cote
For a more ungracious knave is not even now
Between this place and Calycow
Nor a more frantike mad knave in bedelem
Nor a more folle hence to Iherusalem
That if to cume again, parcace he shall refuse
I woll continue as I am and let him choose
And but he cum the sooner by our lady bright
He shall lie without the doors all night
For I woll shit up the gate, and get me to bid
For I promise you I have a very gydie head
I need no supper for this night
Nor would eat no meat though I might
And for you also master I think I best
you go to bid, and take your rest
For who of you had been handelid as I have been
would not be long out of his bid I ween
No more woll I but stele out of s^ght
I pray god give you all good night
And send you better hape, and fortune
The^ to less your self home ward as I have don

Sumwhat it was says the proverb old
That the Catte winked when here iye was out
That is to say^ no tale can be told
But that sum English may be piked thereof out
if so to search the laten and ground of it men will go about
As thi^ (...) enterlud yt before you has bine rehearsed
May signify sum further meaning if it be well serched
Such is the fashyon of the world now a days
That the simple innosaintes as deluded
And an hundred thousand diverse ways
By subtle and craftye means shamefullie abused.
And by strength force, and violence often times compelled
To beliue and say the moune is made of a grene c^^se
Or else have great harm, and parcace their life lose
And an old saying it is, that most times might
Force, strength, power, and colorable subtlete
Do the oppre^se, dybare, ouercum and defeat right
Though yt cause stand never so greatly against equite
and ye truth thereof be known for never so y it cert^^ntye
ye and the pore semple innocent yt has had wrong and in^uri
Must call ye other his good master for showing him such marcye
And as it is daily syne for fere of ferther disprofite
He must that man his best friend and master call
Of whom he never received any manner benefit
And at whose hand he never han any good at all
And must grant, affirm, or deny, what so ever he shall
He must say the Croue is whight, if he be so commanded
ye and that he him self is into a another body changed
He must say he did a mysse, though he (...) d^^ffee^
He must ask forgeuenes, where he did not d^^part
Or else be in troble, care and meserye with out end
And he cast in sum arrierage, without ^y gra^e
And that thing he saw done before his (...) ^ace
He must by compulsion, sufelie de^^e
And for fear whether he woll or not (...) tongue (...)
And in every faculte, this thing is put in (...)
And is so universal that I need no one to name
And as I fere is like evermore to endure
For it is in all faculties a coniuryie sports and game
The weker to say as yt stronger bids, or to have ^lai^
As a cunning sophist woll by argument bring to pass
That the rude shall confess, and gra^^^ himself an (...)
And this is ye daily exoe^^^e, and practice of their scoles
And not emongs them only, but also among all others
The stronger to compel and wake ^ee^e simple foles
To say as they command them in all manner matiers
I woll name none particular, but set them all togithers
with out any exception, for I pray you show me one
Emonges al in the world that uses not such fasion
He that is stronger and more of power and might
If he be disposed to revenge his cau^^
woll sone pike a quarrel be it wrong b^ right
To the inferior and we (...) for a (...) of straues
And woll against him so extremely lay the laws
That he wol put him to the worse, other by false injury
Or by some craft and subtelete, or else by plain teranie
As you saw right now, by example plain
An other fellow being a counterfeat page
Brought the gentylmans servant out of his brain
And made him grant ye him self was fallen in dotag^
Bary^g him self in haud that he did rage
And when he could not bring that to pass by reason
He made him grant it, and say by compulsyon
Therefore happy are they that can beware
Into whose hands they fall by any such chance
which if they do, they hardlye escape care
Troble, Miserye, and woeful greuaunce
And thus I make an end, committing you to his gidau^
That made, and redeemed us al, and to you yt be now heart
I pray god grant, and send many a good new year.
