A Ballad reioysinge the sudden fall,
Of Rebels that thought to deuower us all.

Rejoice with me ye Christians all,
To God give laud and praise:
The Rebels stout have now the fall,
Their force and strength decays.
Which hoped through their Traitrous train,
Their Prince and native soil:
To put by their devises vain,
Unto a deadly foil.
And with their Armies stout in Feilde,
Against their Prince did rise:
And thought by force of Spear and sheilde:
to win their enterprise.
It was the Earl of Westmerland,
that thought him self so sure:
By the aid of his Rebellious band,
his country to devour.
The Earl eke of Northumberland,
his Traitorous part did take:
With other Rebels of this Land,
for Aue Mary's sake.
Saying they sought for no debate,
Nor nothing else did mean:
But would this Realm wear in the state,
That it before has been.
What is that state I would feign know?
That they would have again:
The Popish Mass it is I trow,
With her abuses vain.
As by their doings may apeare,
In coming through each Town:
The Bibles they did rent and tear,
Like Traitors to the Crown.
And Traitors unto god likewise,
By right we may them call:
That do his laws and word despise,
Their Country Queen and all.
The laws that she established,
According to Gods word,
They seek to have abolished,
By force of war and sword.
Forgetting clean their loyalty,
That to their Prince they owe:
Their faith and eke fidelity,
That they to her should show.
And rather seek to help the Pope,
His honor lost to win,
In whom they put their faith and hope,
To pardon al their sin.
That if they should their native Land,
Their Queen and God deny:
They should have pardon at his hand,
For their iniquity.
Therefore with those that love the Pope,
They did their strength employ:
And thereby steadfastly did hope,
Gods flock clean to destroy,
And then set up within this Land,
In every Church and town:
Their Idols on Roodeloftes to stand,
Like gods of great renown.
Their Aulters and tradicions old,
With painted stock and stone:
Pardons and Masses to be sold,
With Kerye leyson.
Friars should wear their old graye Gowns,
And Maids to shrift should com:
then Priests should singe with shaue^ Crowns
Dominus Vobiscum
All these and such like vaneties,
Should then bear all the sway:
And gods word through such fantasies,
Should clean be laid away.
But like as god did them despise,
Which were in Moses days:
That did a calfe of gold devise,
As god to give him praise.
And for the same Idolatry,
In one day with the sword:
Did three and twenty thousand dye,
That did neglect his word.
The Children eke of Israel,
In Ezechias time:
He made among their Foes to dwell,
That did Commit that Crime.
But when that Ezechias prayed,
To God to help his own:
The Lord forthwith did send them aid,
Their Foes wear overthrown,
A Hundred Thousand Eighty Five,
By Gods Aungelles wear slain:
And none of them were left alive,
That took his name in Vain,
Senacheris also the King,
Then of the Assirians:
As he his God was honoring,
Was slain by his two Sons.
Like as he did those Rebels still,
Which did his flock pursewe:
From time to time of his free will,
By force of War subdewe.
As Hollifernus and the rest,
He put them still to flight:
That had his little flock oppressed,
In presence of his sight.
So has he now these Rebels all,
Through their ungodly trade:
Cast down into the Pit to fall,
That they for others made.
To whom still daily let us pray,
Our noble Queen to send,
A Prosperous Reign both night and day,
From her foes to defend.
Her and her Counsel, Realm and all,
During her noble life:
And that Ill hap may them befall,
That seek for War and strife.
FINIS.
