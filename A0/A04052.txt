Four may easily play this Play.

Here enters Wealth, and Health synging together a balet of two parts, and
after speaks Wealth. WHy is there no curtesy^ now I am come
I t^owe that all the people be d^me
Or else so god help me and halyd^^^
They were almost a sleep.
No words I hard, no^ yet no ^^lking
No instrument went nor ballattes synging
What ails you all thus ^^ sit dreaming
Of whom take ye care?
Of my coming ye may be ^l^d
Therefore I pray you (...)
For all your desire shall be had
I can amend your che^^e
By God I think ye have forgotten me.
I am wealth of this realm look upon me
For I am to every man loving and fre^ndly
For wealth has no pere.
Health. Brother wealth have ye not yet done?
ye praise your self above the moon
Every man may perceive thereby soon
That you lack discresyo^

We^th. Wherefore, by god I cannot say to much
I am so welthy of substance and rych
In all the world where is one such
As I am of comparison.

Health. Wealth is good I cannot den^y
Yet praise your self so much ye may
For wealth oftentimes does decay
And wealth is nothing s^re.

Wealth. Wealth has been ever in thi^ country
And here I p^rpose still for to be
For this is the land most mete for me
And here I will endure.

Health Therein ye speak^full louingle
For in this realm wealth should be
yeth no displeasure I pray you heartily
But in the way of communicacion.
And for pastyme I would ^peake some ways
Of no comparison, nor to you no dysp^yre,
I do not intend that manner always,
But for a recreation,

wealth Brother wh^t soever ye say to me.
I will hear yo^ p^ci^^tly
I am content and I (...) you heartily
Begin and say your pleasur^

Health I thank you h^^^^ly th^^ will I
Some what unto my purpose apply
Though wealth be praised maru^lu^ly
yet to mine vnderstauding.
Wealth is mutable, and that in shame
And wealth is hauty and proud of name
Wealth t^ cruel, and in great blame
For wealth is ^^er wauerynge.

w^alth. To whom have I done any harm can ye say,
ye stander me no^e, yet I trust I may
Answer for my selte in every manner way
ye will not deny that?

Health God forbid but ye should d^ so
And ye may do it whether I will or no
Inlykewise, I must answer you als^
When ye say not true.
Though I be but to you a poor man
yet health I height, the same I am
That is desired universally than
Some calls me as good as you

Wealth. As I, mary there in deed ye do compare.
Such words might bring you soon in care
Lewd parson, thou art not ware
Of what substance I am

Health. Yes I can tell what you are, be not dyspleased
wealth is of great substance, that cannot be denied
yet show your commodities, and ye shall be answered
I promise you wellh is fugitive.

wealth What say thou`am I a tagetyue
I was never so taken up in my life
Nor called unsure, well I will make no strife
yet where as thou do lay,
Thai I should show my commodityes always
The best for my self whereof I ask praise
if I should staud her all my life days
yet I could not say.
Nor half the benefits that comes of me
yt cannot be told nor resyted shortly
Wealth is the (...) of althing earthly
That you cannot deny.
Ferste god save, our sovereign Lady the Queen
With all the counsel and all that wish them b^ne
Am not I wealth with them ever at eve
Who should be there but I?
Men of the law, and ioly rych merchants
There be welthy both of goods and lands,
Without comparyson is in their hands
I walth hatg all freasure.

Health. O good sir, of whom comes all this
Of god only, to yo^ no thank I wys
And yet man's wealth ^tands not all in riches
I dare say that boldly,
W^an a man has a cempetent living
with the grace of god that passes all thing
Love of his neighbor, and good reporting
Then is he welthy,
Wealth of goods is but a fame
Ye is wel^hy that has a good name
Every wise man will coueyte the same
For other wealth I not reche
if a man have never so much good name
Every wise man will couey^e the same
if his disposicions be naught and wood
Then he is but a wretch,

Wealth. Nay thou art a wretch, and a fool vuwyse
wealth of riches thus to despise
Do thou not se all the world arise
By goods and substance
He that has plenty of silver and gold
May have all thing whatsoever he would
when can wealth lack, seeing all thing is sold
And wealth is of assurance.

Health I deuye that, your saying is naught
Grace^ heaven, nor cunning, cannot be bought
without great pain, and good deeds wrought
Else man cannot them have.

wealth Stop thereat, and hold thy peace
May not men by heaven with richesse
As to bylde churches and make bye ways
Such deeds man's soul does sans

Health Yea, ^ut yet ye ^ust mark one s^ynge
if these goods came with wrong doing
Shall ye have heaven for so spending
Or yet a^y mede.
Nay nay except that man himself do meek
And make resysta^ce the right ho^our to seek
Else all such good deeds is not woth a leeke
wealth hereof take heed.

wealth. Why think thou that all men which h^th wealth
Gets their goods with brybry and s^ealeth
Thy repor^e is naught therefore Health
I counsel thee to ^ay the best.

Health So I will, but yet I must say true
And ^ow a little more I will say to you
Much sorrow and care w^lth does ^rewe
He i^ seldom in rest.
when a man is a little hit and welthy
And has in his ^hes^e treasures plentye
Then will he wrangle, and do shreudly
By his power and might.
With his neigh^oures he will go to law
And a wreke his malice for value of straw
wealth is fykle and out ^f awe
wylfull in wrong or right

Wealth. Thou speak with a slanderous tong^
All of evil will, and yet it is wro^^e
wealth in this realm has bin louge
Of me comes great honor.
Because that I wealth ^ath great port^
All the world, hy^her does resort
Therefore I w^l^h, am this realms comfort,
And here I will endure.

Health. So I would ye shou^^, and I shall do the same
Health I am called, and that is my name
If I would not abide hear I were to blame
For here I am well cheri^hed
Yet say your self, nhw indifferen^ly
And if every man do not love me
Health as well as wealth, yes verily
Thereof I dare be reported

We^th. Why should they love thee^ that wo^lde I know
As well as me, I pray you show
I am the superior of hi^ and low
No man may compare with me.

Health. To show why I will not be afraied
For I can bide by that I ^aue said
If welthy men be very well apayd
Or much they set you by.
But of wealth, if they have never so much
Goods, tryasure and gold, and be called rych
Yet if they lack health, there pain is such
That they were better dye.
A man to were gold, and be in pay^e
What joy has he? none, but would be feign
To give all his treasure for health plain
Or else he were very mad:
For if a man be never so pour
Yet if he have health, that is a treasure,
Then for his living, he may labor
And in his heart be glad,

Wealth. I never marked thus much, nor understood
That Health was such a treasure, and to man so good
Wherefore I am sorry, and I will change my mood
Now I pray you forgive me.

Heal^h I will forgive or else I were to blame
And I pray you to forgive me the same
I love you hartly, and will praise your name
if it please you to keep my company.

Here enters lyberty with a so^g and after speaks libert Why tarry syrs
whether are ye going
I see well ye looked not for my commi^g
Lo, out of sight out of remembry^g
Abse^ce is cause of strau^gnes,
What look ye on werwhy are ye so strange
From your fellow liberty, does your minds change
I^ your company I was wont to range
What needs all this business,

wealth By liberty now I do not set
Seeing that health and I am met
As feloweh together no man shall let
Me for to love him best.

liberty. Let me hear what ye do say
Then ye are about to cast me away
How happes this? mary then I may
Go pyke strawes and take me rest.
I pray you tell me whom I have o^fended
if I have made a fault it shalde amended
with so short warning let me not be voyded
I crow yet ye do but jest.

He^th^ Why do ye make this cauelacion
we entende to make no alteracyon
wealth and I have had communication
He is my freende of old.

liberty What was the matter, I pray you tell
Me thinks I ought to be of counsel
Or else I promise you ye do not well
With you I should behold.

Wealth. The matter is done we are agreed
To reason it more it shall not need
O brother health, thou art in deed
More preciouser then gold.

liberty. Gods bodi how comes this gere to pas
I am cast out at the carts arse
The world is nothing as it was
For I am here refused

Health Why be you angry that we do agree
Then are ye not wy^e, for if ye love me
I will love him again, so it should be
Or else I were mysaduised

^^libert Then of my love ye set no store
My company I see well ye looked notfore
Farewell I will get me out of the door
yet I am your betters and so am I called.

wealth Such presumptuouse words will have a fall
your comparyson is but feeble and small
What can ye do nothing at all
As you have reputed.

liberti. What were ye both two, were not I.
Wretches and caytyfes, look not so hye
Think no scorn hardly
For I may be your pear
if wealth have never so much substance
Lacking Liberty and we^r in duraunce
Within a white, I am in assurance
ye would pray me come nere.
If Health be never so lust and strong
yet if Lyberty were kept from him long
Then sorrow and care would be his song.
yt would abate your cheer.
Fie of wealth which lacks ^ybertye
Fie of Health and be in captivity
Fie of riches and lack good company
Lyberty has no pere,

(...). Will ye hear how he does clatter?
What need ye to rehearse all this matter.
ye know that we twain before any other.
Lyberty must needs have still.
Liberty o^ us is glade to wait
ye stand to far i^ your own conceyte
I wys lybertye ye ran make no bayte
To catch us at your will.

liberty^ Now there ye lie, I can suffer no longer
Wealth for Liberty does lobo^re ever
And health for Liberty is a great store
Therefore set me not so light

wealth Liberty I pray the reasou no more
ye are welcome to us as ye were before
In deed of liberty it is great suter
Therefore welcome by this light

liberty^ Now I thank you both full kindly
your strange words a little did grene me
And now at your commandment I am ready
And at your own will.

Here enters with some jest ill will Will. Mary I am come at the first call
Will, your own man have me who shall
For I am will servant to you al
Ye shall not need to send for me.

Wealth. Who is acquanted with this man
He is very homely and little good he can
To come in here so boldly, then
D^^ue him away quickly,

W^ll. Why, I came not till C was called
your own will opeuly ye named
Then I came a pace lest I should be blamed
Ther^ore I pray you let me hyde still,

(...) Whose will, or what will, does he mean
Thou art not my will, I forsake thee clean
My will and their wylles is often seen
Our wylles can none ill

Will. Alas good masters I can none ill
yet by my troth I am your evil will
your will, and your will, and yonr will, therefore keep m^
I love ye by gods mother,

liberty. This is a strange saying unto me
My will, your will, and his will, this cannot be
For in our wyles is great diversity
For one is not like another,

^yll. Yet by Christ your own will I am
The maddest will, and the meriest, than
For gods sake now, let me be your man
Till ye have better acquaintance.

wealth I perceive this fellow is kind
And owes to us good will and mind
Some kinds again then let him find
Let him have some furderauuce

Will. By god ^ir and I durst be so bold
A^quaintance of this man claim I would
and ky^ted to, if the troth were told
we be of one consangnynitie

H^alth How so? let me here that I pray thee hartly

Will. Will and lyberty^is, of aunci^erie old
with ont lyber^ye, will dare not be^olde
And where will lacks, lybertye is full cold
Thyrfore will and lybertye must needs be of kyn.

liberti. In deed as he says it may well be
For will ever longs unto lybrtye
Therefore good freende welcome to me
I pray you al be good to him
And goes out
Wealth. For your sake he is welcome to b^ all
Let him come to our place an^ than he shall
Have succoure of us and help withal
and now we will ^epart. And wealth and health goth out.

Will. Will ye go hence. I thank ye masters with all my heart
I will s^ke you out I warrant you fear not
Now they be gone I am glad by saint mary
A lyttel while hear I purpose to tarry
How to deceive wealth, health, and liberty
Now must I deuyse.
For I am a child that is pas grace
I will I am called that in every place
Does much mi^chiefe this is a plain case
Virtue I do utterly despise,
But if they wist what I were
Then of my purpose I should be never y^ ^ere
I will keep my ^onge le^^e that I ^^r.
My whole intent and will.
But now I marvel by this day
Where shrewd wit is gone a stray
Some crafty touch is in his way
I here him, peace, stand still
Enters shrewd wit with a song. Dien vous guard playsaunce
On seven or no ^^^chaunce, what youkers dare auaunte
To play a grote or twain.
Lo hear I have in store
Two or three grotes and no more
I take great thought therefore
For to keep it, it is much pain
I come uow out of a place
where is a company of small grace
Thieves and hores that spendes a pace
They were dronken all the sort.
One of their purces I did a spy
Out of his sleue where it did lie
And one wynked on me with his eye
But there began the sport
Their false falsehode, and I crafty wit
got the purse lo, hear I have it
I ran my way and let him sit
Smoke and shitten arse together.
And if that I had ill will here
with this money we would make good chere
Gentle brother will, I pray the apeare
For thou art in some corner.

Wit I would come in but I am a fearde
Least that I be taken by the bearde
With some catchepol, I have heard
How thou haste stolen a purse

wit Thou horsou art thou mad, cum in I say
This is not the first hazard that I have escaped
if I make au hand to deck my felfe gay
what am I the worse.

will From thy company I cannot abide
I must ^edes hold upon ^hy side
y^^wyll and shrewd wit who ca^ hyde
For they will be together.

wit. Now welcome will and what ch^a^^:
By god I thought for thee a tho^sand year
P^ace for gods body who cummeth there
Hauce bear pot Ascon router.
Enters Hance with a dutche song. Gut nyuen s^one rutters by the mother got

Hauce Ic ^or^^e ye vell ye seg dac ic ^^ope

Will. Well coppin I pray the hartly tell us true
Wherefore come thou hither for any thing to sew

Hanc^ ye icke f^g^r en bu^bardere va^ de koyni^g wei it be
Heb twe skelling de dagh ic c^n scote de culueryn

wit. Nay ye shall walk a fleming knave, will ye not see
We have English g^nners ynow, there is no rome empty

Hance Ic best en ^om^erde mo^ye to m^ spreken

Will. We speak not to thee thou art a s^one man
But go thy way they be not here that promot y^ ca^

Hance Cant ye me a de house dragen van degrot here.

wit. Hauce ye must go to y^ court and for wealth inquire

Hance What segre ye wealth nenyke he is net hoar
wealth best in s^aunders, it my self brought him door

Will. Be shrew your horson s^eminges heart therefore.
in deed as he says, by war in ^lau^ders theris wealth store

Hance Segt ye dat brower, by the mother got dan
Gut naught it mot waft, to sent cafrin to mi lanina^
and goes out
will. Is he gone, farewell hanykin house
I pray god give him a hounded drouse
For I trow a knave brought him to house
But now brother wit.
We must deuo^e how that we may
Be in service with wealth always
Let me here what thou can do or say
To help for to contryue it.

wit. For thy pleasure that I shall
This will I do first of all
Flatter and lie, and evermore call
Them my good masters still.
Then with swering, lying and powlinge
Brybry theft, and preuy pyking
Thus I shred wet, will ever be doing
I warrant there ill will.

Will. I ^un thee thank, this is well devised
And I ill will, would have every man despised
B^^ now another thing must be con^riued
O^ else al will be naught
There is one they call good remedy
I^ this realm, he has gee^t actor^^y
He is a no^le m^^ and much worthy
Many thiuges he hach wrought
He is called l^st, discreet and indifference
Willing to fulfill his souer^i^es commandment
H^ is not fraide to do right punishment
T^erfore of him I am afraid

wit. So an I to this makes me very sad
Yet oftentimes I h^^e been hard bestadde
N^w yt I ^m ^a^ned of him I am v^ry glad

Beguyle us all, yet I charge ye ^ay
Ye shall not beguile us if I may
I will beware betyme.

Will. Sir be not angry I you pray

He meneth that he will be profitable always
And save you many things.

Health^ What he means I cannot te^^
But his saying is not well
Depart hence syrs by my council
And tarry us at our lodging.

Therefore will and wit I will ^epe still.

Here comes remedy in and to him says Wealth. Sir your maystership is ^a^tely

liberty S^r to know wherefore ye come we are desyrons

Remdi I am be that ought for to be well known
Of you three specially, and of duty
Great pain and business as for mine own
For you I have taken because I love you heartily
To m^i^taine you is all my de^yre and faculty
yet hard it is to do, the people be so variable
And many be so wilful, they will not be reformable.

wealth Sir I pray you pardon us of our ignorance now

And I desire you all or to be loving ^o me
For your own ease, come w^lth and profyt

Wealth Good remedy, then we ^anst des^re your aydyng
For by good remedy comes all ou^ preferri^g.

Remdi All that I do intend, if ye^ will thereto agr^e
And to be reformable for your own case
It is not the thing that lies only in me
But my good will, therefore I will not cease
To have your love and favor, and thereby to please
All the world over, and to promote ^his realm
That you three may prosper, ye perce^ue what I mean
The chief part of all wealth lies in great estates
Their substance and lands. is right commendable
Prelates of the church is welthy of riches
Merchau^tes has marchau^dise and goods iuco^perable
Me^ of ^aw and franklins is welthy which i^ laudable
Th^s wealth of riches is divided diverse ways
And to these ma^^ charges, come now a days

Health My heart re^o^se^h to ^er^ your good reporting

Remdi Forsooth here is (...) half^ that I cou^^ re^erse
The benefits of god that ^e shows to you wealth
Consider Englysh men, how va^iant they be and fer^e
O^ al nacious ^one such, when they have their ^elth
No land can do us ^arme, b^^ with falle^^d or ^elth

Specially ye grace of god, which is our (...) fordera^ce
If there be any that will grudge, surm^^^ or ^^o

Show ^ine authority and power, for ^o remedy it ^o
That no^e of you shall diminishe nor amiss^ be ^ane
I good remedy therefore may and will speak^ won^ bla^e
For the commonwealth, and health both of the soul and b^dy
y^ is mi office and power, and therefore I have my actoritie

wealth Our lord con^inue ye, and we thank you har^ly
Both for your good i^struction, and for your kindness
That you int^nd^ so well for us good remedy
when we have need we will desire your goodness

Health When we be infect in the soul or body
Then will I seek good remedy for succo^r
As yet I thank god I have no need greatly
if I have then will I seek to have your favor

liberty Sir now we will depart hence with your license

Remdi For other diverse business that we mus^ have tohether

Remdi I pray god be ^our speed and preserve you from pain
it is mi mind ye should prosper I would have it so ^ain.

W^ll. Here is none of our acquaiutau^ce will re^our^eth
we have made to louge tar^aunce
that will y^ say perc^^unce
And they begone home come away apar^

Wit. Nay by god not so ^astie
A little while we will larye
Good even s^r to you mary
Dwell ye in this place?

Remdi Nay good fellow I dwell not ^eare
Wherefore do thou that inqui^^:
Would thou ought with any ^eare
Speak ^e not afryde

Will. By God I would I had your gown
And were a mile without the town
Thereon A would borowe a crown
It is I that so said

Wit. Hew look thou one him half a scorn
I p^omise you he is a scant gentylman bor^e
What su^y^st thou in his face

Remdi For somewhat in his face I lok^e
Iu deed his mastership stands a crook^
For false shrewes both of you I took
And children that be past grace.

Will. I will swear for him, as ^or this years twenty
that he has been ever as true as I
yet sometime he will steal and make a (...)
He is of my alyaunce.

Remdi In good faith the same think I
That ye be both like, full unthrifty
Syrs how do ye live, show me quickly
Or I shall put you in duraunce

wit. How live we? mary our meat
Cummest thou hither for to threte:

From wh^n^e does he come can ye show

Will. What do thou ayle can thou tell?
Have thou any thing with us to mell?
By the mass thy hands does tykell
Thou shall bear me a blow.

remedi you false thieves I know ye well
I shall let your purpose ^u^y deal
ill will, and shrewd wit, the devil of hell
Take ye both for me.

wit. Mary thou lie, our names be not so
Call us but wit, and will, add no more thereto,
if thou do thou were as good no
We shall handle you shrewdly

Remdi Syrs farewell here I will no longer abide
For you both shortly I will provide
Tha^ all your ^al^e craft shall be out tried
And our subtillitie known
and goes out.
wit. To go so soon the horson was wise
therefore some now I must devise
that each man may wealth, health and liberti despise
Or else he will mar all our mateer.
Brother wat, let me alone
When they come you shall see me a none
C^mplayne of him^ unto them ec^one
And put him out of favor

Wit Peace no mo word^s, for they come yonder

wealth Syrs I am glade that you h^ hear
How does all our houshold^ with them what chere^
Is every thing in order there
A^ir^ our intent?

will. ye sir they be all merry and glad
With revel and ^out sometime they be mad
Pipe whore bo^t heef, every knave and drabe
Is at our commandment.
Health ^urneth him. What do ye say, then ^e are to blame
And we put you in trust for the same
To keep such rule, it is a shame
It is not for our honour^

wy^^e. By the mass ^he horson does lie
There is no such rule by gods body
A man may break his ^eck as lightly
As his fast in your kechin, or seller truly.
Liberty turns him With that another I am ^o^ co^te^t
I would there should be libera^itie compe^e^t
And with honesti it is con^enient
That our nei^hbour fare the better

Will. you be a^g^y with all that we have done
Cum away brother let us go ^eus soon
I know a n^w m^ister where we shall be welcum^
God be with ^ou gentyl master

Wealth. Why will ye begone ^or a word
P^raduenture we did but boorde
Me think ye should your master foorde
For to speak my mind.

wit Nay ^ay, I can tell what was the matter
Remedy was here, and he did ^latter
ye trust he more than us and better
But mark the end, what ye shall find

H^alth With good remedy we spoke iu deed
To ^^low his counsel we had need
He warned us that we should take heed
Of excess and prodigality.

Wit I marvel ye speak so of good remedy
It is I that can do more than be
Wit can make shyft at necessit^
When Remedi cannot be heard
I know some that has this thousand year
Sought god remedy and yet never the nere
wit can put remedy by, yea this is clear
For wit is a crafty lad.

Will. And will is an ungracious stay
Will has done many things me^ say
And if ye let wit and will go his way
ye will repent it soon.

liberty Why what cause have you to go your way
ye shall abide which us though you say nay
I will follow will, and wit always
And so I have ever done

wit. if I wilt al my masters would so do
Then from your service I would ^ot goo
Speak ^ow whether ye will or no
And let us know your mind

Health Syrs ye be welcome to me plain
And for your company I am full feign
I had lever suffer great pain
Then to leave my wit and will,

Will. Then let us go hence, with ki^dnes my herye do kill

Health I pray you let us go, wherefore do we bide still.
and goes out
Remdi As touching my first purpose hither I am com again
I trow ye k^ow me, good remedy is my name
That every day does take great^ abor or pain
To amend all faults, I am chosen to the same
if any ma^s conscience here does grudge or shame
Having in him self remorse, and mendes in time and space
I am good remedy, and god is full of mercy and grace
Therefore I will stand aside, and a lyttel while remain
Of wealth, Health and Lybertye, for to inquire
How they be ordered, and if any man complain
I will be glad to show me remedy, my think I se one apeare.

where is wealth, health and ^iberty. I would see the^ come i^

Health Health comes in with a kercher on his head.
O good lord help me, by yonr license my souerain
I am homely to com her in your presence thus diseased
Need constrains me, for remedy I would have feign
I am i^fect both body and soul, I prai you be not displesed

Remdi Why what aile you show me, yet you I do not know
Glad I am to remedy auy man, that is affirmity
I perceive by your phisnamy, yt ye ar very weke feeble and low
yet show me your g^iefe, and I will help you gladl^.

Health Gracious remedi I tha^k you, yet I am half ashamed
to show you mi maladi and mi name, I was cal^ed health
Therefore I am well worthi to be punished and blamed
Because I have not followed your counsel, but al thing
may be suffered save wealth.

Remdy Are you health, this makes me very pe^^i^e and sad
yet be of good chere, and show how you were infect
To remedy you and succor you I would be very glad
For god will pu^ish the people when they be de^elt

Health Sir I thank god thereof for well worthy I am
My conscien^e does judge, some trouble have I must
A me^des I will make to god and if I can
Will and wit has deceived me in them I put my trust.

Remdi if thou have ^oone amiss, and be sorry therefore
Then helfe ame^des is made, for that is contrission
Let that pass, now will I axe you one thing more
Where be wealth and Liberty, be they of good disposicio^

Health As for wealth is fallen iu decay, and neces^itie
By wast and war, through ill will, and ^hrewd wit
And liberty is kept in duraunce and captivity
God help us all, and send us good remedy for it

Remdi For to hear this tale it makes my heart heavy
yet be of good comfort, god is full of grace, and I am good

Health Sir, the^ I beseech you help us in the way of charity

Remdi I would feign but I cannot tell which way to begin
Except I might catch will and wi^, then I trow I could
Tie the^ shorter, for they destroy wealth, health and liberty by sin
if I had ye thieves, puni^h the^ extremly I wole.

Health You may soon catch them, if ye will stand a side
From this place they two, will uot^onge abide.

Remdi Me thinke^h I here them com, help to hold the^ fast will turns

(...). Cum in wit for here is no body
We may ve bold and talk largely
Our hearts to ease and show plainly
What we have done.

wit I must needs laugh I cannot forbear
To remember war^e that knave will ye hear
The horson fleming was be ^^itten for fear
Because he should boyde so soon.
Herke now do I marvel by this bread

W^ll. For I we^^ surely that h^lth be dead
I saw saw him go with a kercher on his head
As he should go to hangyng.

^ytte Hark in thine Ear, if t^^e horson hap
To complain to him that weres the red cap
I fear theu shortly he will us cla^
By the heles from out liuing^

Will. Nay nay, there is no doubt
By him I have reported all about
Tha^ he does not well, his good name to put out
ylwyl cannot say well,

remedi. Friend therein thou art the more to blam
Cos^au^der me wrongfully, and vudesr^ued
But or thou drpart thou shall answer for the same.
where is Wealth and liberty, how have thou the^ ordered?

Will. Qury cicis quest is un malt ombre
Me is un spy and nardo compoco pa^lauere.

Health Thou folse thief is thine English tongue gone
as mischeuous il will and shrewd wit, ye have destroyed mani on

Wit. Sir hurt not me, and I will tell you troth anon
This same i^ as false a knave as ever came wtin saint Iohe^s

will. Per amorde my as pi ca un poco
Eo queris and a^ pour lag^^^n^ creae so

Remdy I can not tell what thou do m^ae blabbler:
But you shall speak English and confess an other matter,

Health Sir I beseech your lordship, in the way of charity
Let not these thefes escape your hands they have destroyed us v^terly.

wit: Sir, believe him not he speaks but of malice only
we be true men, thereof we shall fetch good witness
An honest man that shall be bound for him and me
The law says plain, nulla fides con^^^^estes
that is troth, but who will be witness or bound for the

Remd There is three among you in this house

Will. I Iyf^o to fetch them quickly

Wit. They will come vnse^d for I warant you if they will

Remd what be their names, tell me what they be,

Will. That on is John Irische and John s^oler
But full these be honest men all thr^^^

Health Trust not their words they will dessemble still
They are so false and cra^^y, all ^heyr intent is ill.

Will. ye lie falsely, I ^peake but right and reason
And by the law of arms ye must ned^s be ^ane
you a^e called good remedy which a^ al feason
Should leave to man's life, and ma^^taine the same
we be he^e ^oth your prisoners wrongfully accused by de^ame
Keep ou^ of us fast let him lie for all
That other sor friends and wytnes goo shall.

wyt^e, Sir let him not goo and le^e me behind
He will ever ^e a false knave, for I k^ow his mind

Will. Hold thy tongue folis^ k^aue I do not mean so

Remd^ I here now ye cannot agree, which of you should go

Will. No by gods body there shall none go but I

Wit. Tho^ playest the knave it must needs be I

Health Keep them safe I pray you for if they scap again
Many me^ shall repent it, it shal^e to our pay^e

Remdi They be here yet, to keep them fast is mine inteut,
Have them away both to prison in continent.

will. Lo false knave this is for thy crafty wi^.
Now fast by the heels we are lake to sit.

Wit. I am co^^ent so that I may have comp^ny
if I should be hanged, I would be hanged honest
and goth out
Remd^ Go bence with them and bring wealth and liberty.

health, Com away ye thenes, now I shall keep you s^rely,
and goth out
Will. Lock us up and keep us as fast as ye can
yet ill will and ^^rewd wit shall be with many a man.

Remdi I am half ashamed, that long i^ has been said
That noble men by such wretches has been decei^ed
they did rejoice and jest, and were very well apaide
Trusting to ^cape clea^e, and ^tyl for to have rained
But now they shall not so, let them be well assured
That ylwyl and shrew de wit shall have but ill rest
For wheresoever they be I will break^ their nest

wealth In the honor of god we ask you forgeue^es al th^e
we ought to be ashamed ^o look you in the face
By our folly and negligence, we have done so unwisely
we were towle deceived, we p^t us to your grace
This shall be a good warding for us alonge space
when man is well punished then he will beware
w^o that knows what need is, well after dread ^are

Remd^ I may not blame you greatly for by mine own reason
I know ylwyl and shrewd wit deceives great and small
if ye can rema^bre thys^ and beware a ^other season
This is a good example and lerni^g to you all
Now serve god and love him, and for grace ever call
And ylwyl and shrewde wit, from yo^ I shall ab^taine
ye have used them to long to your damage and pain.

health. Forsooth sir ye sai troth, they did us great disp^esur
Full hard it is to banquishe the vngr^cious ylwyl
He is so crooked, by slattery, dissula^ion and such other
Man's mind i^ so var^able, and glad to report ill
I fear many one yet would have him rain still
For some unto their own will has so much affection
yet the devyl an^ ill will is both of o^e complexion

liberty^ ill will is naught, but worse is shrewd wit
For he contryueth al subtle ymanginacien
yt were impossible for a man else to do it
shrewd wit breweth myscef^ and false conspyracion
He has put me lyberty in prison, and great at tribulacion
if it had not been for your good remedi and fortherau^ce
I ^ other yt has liberty, should have be^ in duraunce.

Remdi Be al of good chere, and have no mistrust
The e^de of ill will and shrewd wit is but shame
Though they reygue a while, wrongfully and vniu^^
yet truth will appear and their misdedes blame
Then wrong (...) su^^ued, and good remedy ta^^
Though ^alsehodeloke, and hide his matters all
Craft w^^l out and disce^te will have a fall
Whereas ye are now, in distress all three
Near were ye brought in case like ^o mar
Now have ye no dou^t, if ye will ^e ruled after m^
I shall restore ye again as well as ever ye were
Wealth keep still this realm, look ye stray not fa^^
And Health be of good chere, your disease I ca^ soon me^de
Liberty now ye ^e released do no more off^nd,

wealth Now let us al thank god ye good remedy has s^ude
Trust to him only for his grace and goodness
we are forgiveness o^ our trespa^ I trust we will amend
And clean for^ake syn, folly, and unthriftiness
(...) we will here conclude, sovereign of your graciousnes
we beseech you to ^emyt our negligence, and misbehauor
There we have said ami^s, we commit also your favor

Health And for your preseruacion heartily we will pray
your realm to increase, with ^oy and tranquillity
That wealth, health and liberty, may co^tinne here always
By the oversight and aid of him that is good remdy
which willingly does his deu^^, under your actoritye
As part here apereth your p^rpose to mai^taine
God continue his good^es, that long he may riagne

Remdi Jesus preserne queen Elizabeth ye noble pri^cis worthy
Jesus continue her health long for to endure
Ies^ indue her w virtue grace and honor
Jesus maintain the lords of ye counsel to exec^te good remedi ever
Jesus speed and help al them gods honor to further
Jesus increase the comunaltie to prosper and do well.
