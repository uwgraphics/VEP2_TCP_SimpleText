HEreafter Folowith the book called the Myrroure of Our Lady very necessary
For all relygyous persons.





The first prologue. Here Begins the Prologue of this present book
following which is called our Ladies myroure.
VIderunt eam Filie Syon / et beatissimam predicauerunt. Cantice. vi.
These words are written in holy scripture and are thus to say in english /
The doughtres of Syon have seen her (that is to say our lady) and they have
showed her most blessed. In which words the holy ghost says three things
that long to the praysynge of our most blessed lady. First who they be
that praise her / when he says. the daughters of Syon. The second / what
they do or they begin to praise her / when he says that they have seen
her. The third / the manner of her praysynge / when he says and they have
showed her most blessed / therefore he says. The doughtres of Syon have seen
her and they have showed her most blessed. First the holy ghost tellyth who
they be that praise our Lady / for he callyth them doughtres of Syon. But
though all christen soulles that treuly live in christen faith / may be called
doughtres of Syon / that is to say of holy church: yet more properly ye ar
called daughters of Syon. For not only ye ar doughtres of holy church by
christen believe as other christen people is: But also ye are doughtres of this
holy relygion / which as a mother noryssheth your soulles in grace in this
Monastery that is named Syon. And therefore as ye are doughtres of this bodily
Syon / so ought ye to be doughtres of Syon gostly / For Syon is as much to say
/ as a commandment or byholdinge. And ye ought to be doughtres of
commandment by meke and ready obedyence to the byddynges of god / and of your
reule / and of your soueraynes / ye ought also to be doughtres of byholdynge
by co^templacyon. and specially in byholdynge of your own wretchedness / and
of your unkindness agenste god / and of the charity and goodness that he does
to you. ye ought to behold also the shortness and unstableness of this life /
the hastynes of death / the ferefulnes of dome / the bytternes of pains / and
the swyete and joyful rewards of bliss. And if ye be thus good doughtres of
Syon by meke obedyence and by true beholdynge of these things: then ar ye well
dysposed the more worthyly to praise our most glorious lady. The second
thing that the holy ghost tellyth in these words (is) that ye ought to do or
ye begin to praise our lady. And that is that ye ought to se her. For ye
wot well that no man ne may well show the worthynes or the propertyes of any
thing to the praysynge thereof: but if he have first some sight and knowledge of
the same thing by one mean or other. How shall ye then condewly show by
outward praysyng the excellent hyghnes and worthynes of the most blyssed
heavenly queen our reuerente lady / as yt is full fair expressed in all your
holy service: but if ye have first sight thereof by inward understanding. But
for asmoche as many of you / though ye can sing and read / yet ye can not se
what the meaning thereof is: therefore to the only worship and praysyng of
our lord Jesus christ and of his most merciful mother our lady and to the
gostly comfort and profit of your souls I have drawn your legende and all
your service in to Enlyshe / that ye should se by the understanding thereof /
how worthy and holy praysynge of our glorious Lady is content therein / and
the more deuoutely and knowyngly sing yt and read yt / and say yt to her
worship. And in many places where the nakyd letter is though yt be set in
enlyshe / is not easy for some simple soulles to understand* I expound yt and
declare yt more openly / other before the letter / or after or else fourth
with to gyther. And farthermore / that ye should have the more sprytuall love /
and inward delight and devotion / in this holy service I tell the causes and
the meanynges of each part thereof that is to say / when I come to the first
Inuitory* I tell what an Inuitatory is to say / and why yt is named so and set
in such a place. And so I do of Psalms / and Hympnes / and Antempnes / and
respo^ces and versicles / and all such other. For I declare why they are called
so / that is to say / why an hympne is called an hympne / and why an Antepmne
is called an Antempne / and so fourth of other / and why they are set and said
in such wise / as ye may se more plainly in the story of the Sunday / each
thing in his place. Of psalms I have drawn but few / for ye may have them
of Richard hampoules drawing and out of English bibles if ye have lysence
thereto Also when I draw a thing ones in to english I write it not again as
often as I find it after in each place / but only in the first place / as
Gloria patri, is declared i^ the beginning of matyns on Sunday / and Maria
m^^er, and Gloria tibi domine, in the end of the first Hympne the same day.
And then I speak no more thereof in all your service after / as often as yt is
said. And the same I do of all such other for the most part. ye shall also
understand that this book is divided in to three parties. For first I have
compyled a little treatys of.xxiiii. Chapytres / wherein is showed the
condycion of divine service / when and where / and in what wise yt ought to be
said and song / and specially of your holy service how heavenly / and
gracyously it was ordained and made. And this treatyce is the first part of
the book. The second part is of your seven stories / according to the seven
days of the wyeke. And the third part is of your masses. And for asmoche as
ye may se in this book as in a myrroure / the praysynges and worthiness of our
most excellent lady therefore I name it. Our ladies myroure / Not that our
lady should se herself therein / but that ye should se her therein as in a
myroure / and so be styred the more devoutly to praise her / and to know where
ye fail in her praysinges / and to amend: till ye may come there ye may se
her face to face wythouten any myrroure. And therefore now most dear and
devout systres / ye that are the spouses of our lord Jesus christ / and the
special chosen maidens and doughtres of his most reuere^de mother / lift up
the eyes of your soulles toward your sovereign lady / and often and bysely
look and study in this her myrroure / and not lyghtely but contynually / not
hastynge to read much at ones / but labouryng to know what you read that ye
may se and understand her holy service / and how ye may serve her therwyth t^
her most plesau^ce that like as it goyth daily thorughe your mouths so let yt
synke and sauoure contynually in your hearts. And where aboutes may your
hearts be better occupyed^ where may ye have more holy and heavenly medytacyons*
And where may you have deper or swetter contemplacion* then to behold in the
story of the Sunday / the glory of the blessed endeles Trinite in onehed of
substance and of Godhe. And to se him / how he Ioyed ever from without the
beginning of the glorious vyrgyn Mary / having her endelesly as present in
the syghte of his Godly forknowynge. And on modaye to behold and se with your
gostly eyes the felycyte and bliss of innumerable multitude of Angels / and
how they all and one as they were made Ioyed of our glorious lady that was
then unmade* and loved her more then themself. On twesday / ye may se how Adam
after he was so worthyly made / fell so wretchydly in to sin / and what sorrow
he had therefore And how he and all Patriarchs and Prophets had forknowynge of
our Lady / and thereby were comforted in all their trybulacyons. On wednesday
ye may se / how this gloriuos Lady / so much loved / and so long desired*
began to come fourth in to this world by so marvelous clean concepcion and
holy birth / and what charity God had in heaven to man's health / and what
charity that same Lady had in earth / after her birth. On thurseday ye may
Joyfully se / how excellent she was in virtues / how holy in conuersacyon /
how full of fayrenes in soulle and in body / and the maruaylous in carnacyon of
our lord Jesus christ in her. On friday ye may se her great and vnspe^able
sorrows that she had before her sons incarnacyon and after his birth / and
specially in time of his most bitter passion. On Saturday ye may se the holy
life of our Lady / namely from time of her sons passion / unto her
assumpcyon / and how she was taken up in to heaven both Soulle and body. and
set most nyghe the blessed Trinyte above all creatures. And so the Joy that
the same blessed Trinyte had of the same glorious Lady / endelesly or she was
made as ye read on Sunday: was fulfilled in her. effectually in deed / in her
assumpcyon / as ye read on Saturday. And thus from Sunday till Saturday / daily
/ wekely / and yearly* ye ar occupied with your tongues in our Ladies service /
wherefore ye ought to take heed / that your minds be as besy and co^tynually
occupied about the same things by inward understanding and devotion. And
for that cause* look often and right often in this our Ladies myrroure* that
yt may sothefastely be veryfyed of you / that the doughtres of Syon has seen
her. The third thing that the holy gooste shewyth in the said words / Is
the manner how ye shall praise our most reverend and glorious Lady / and
that is / openly / mekely / and devoutly. For openly ye owghte to praise her
and dystynctely / that other folk may understand your praysyng to their
edyfycacyon. and therefore he says they have showed / For a thing that is
showed / is made open to other folks knowledge / ye ought also to pray se her
mekely / so yt in the open showing of her praysynge ye seek her worship / and
not your own. And therefore he says. They have showed her. And not himself.
Devoutly also ye ought to praise her / beholdinge in your mind in time of
your praysynge / by inward love and devotion: how glorious / how excellent /
and how blyssyd she is above all creatures whom ye praise. And therefore he
says They have showed her mos^e blessed. And in all this / ye ought ever to
thank and praise / and to worship god. For that he has made this most
reverend lady / so gracious so glorious and so good. And for he has given her
so much worship and excellence and power above all his creatures / and for he
has called you so specially to her service and for he has given you so open
knowledge of her most high and excellent worthynes / For these great
benyfytes / and for all other / ye ought ever and co^tyneually to joy in your
god and to praise your heavenly king / namely with his holy dyuyne service / as
the Prophet in the psalter exhorts you and says. Psalm. C.x^ix
Filie Syon exultent in rege suo, laudent nomen eius in choro / that is to say
/ the daughters of Syon must joy in their king / and they must praise his
name in ye quier And when ye ar thus occupied in these godly praysinges and in
other times also / namely when ye ar most nygh to your king and to your
quiene / I pray you hert^y and lowly / and not only you that are now / but all
y^ shall com after you / and look in this myrroure: that like as true charity
to your soulles health / and comfort / forsothe has styred me to this labor
/ and none other erthly thing: so ye vouchesafe of your tender charity.
heartily to pray for our right pour and full wretched soulle / that our
mercyful lord Jesus christ clenseyt and cure yt with the medycyne of his mercy /
and grant yt ever to Joy and to delight in love of him / and of his most
worthy mother / and in nothing else. And the same Lord by mean of the same
glorious vyrgynhys mother: may grant you all / the same that lives and
rayneth with the father / and with the holygooste endeles god Amen.

Here endyth the first prologue / and begins the second.
YT is not light for every man to draw any long thing from latin in to our
English tongue. For there is many words in Latin that we have no propre
englyssh according thereto. And then such words must be turnyd as the
sentence may best be vnderstondyd. And therefore though I labor to keep both
the words and the sentence in this book as far as our language will well
assente: yet some time I follow the sentence and not the words as the matter
asks. There is also many words that have diverse vndersto^dynges / and some
time they are taken in one wise / some time in an other / and some time they may
be taken in diverse wise in one reason or clause Diverse words also in diverse
scryptures: ar set and understood some time other wise then auctoures of
gramer tell or speak of. Our language is also so diverse in yt self / that
the common manner of spekyng in English of some co^tre / can skante be
vnderstondid in some other co^tre of the same lord. And for these causes and
such other / if any persons there be that hold them self co^nyng as some do
/ that when they can only a little gramer / or a little latin / and scarcely
that well* they are more bold to catch at a man's saying / or at his writing
/ then would many wise clerks that be. Therefore if any such parsone happen to
se this book or any other of our drawyng and find any thing therein not
drawn to his entente / and therefore is ready to blame yt / and to say yt is
wrong* I counsel you that in symplenes seek your soulles fode* and to take
little head at his saynges. wyttynge well that the wyser that any man is* the
better will he be aduysed / or he blame an other man's studdy. And the less
good that he can* the more presu^ptuous will he be to find defaulte and to
deprave / ye often times tho things that he vndersto^dyth not. And therefore
they that hold them self so wise / may be content with their own wisdom
For I began this work nothing for them / but for the edyfycacyo^ of you yt
feel symplely in your own wits / and love to be enformyd. I am not wyser
the^ was seint Hierome / that in ye drawyng of holy scripture from other
la^gage in to latin / says how he was co^pellyd at each book to answer to the
bakbytnige of them that depraved his labor. In prologo primo super Ioh.
But for that I know mine own feoblenes / as well in co^nyng as in verteu*
therefore I will neither seek defaulte in other / ne maynteyne mine own* but
lowely I submyt me and all our wrytynges / and other works to the correccyon
of our mother holy church / and of the prelates and fathers thereof / and of
all that are wyser and can feel better. Besechynge you all way most dear and
devout systres to pray / that both this / and all other deeds be ever rewlyd
to our lords worship. Amen.

Here endyth the Chapitres / And begynnyth the First part of this Book that
is called our Ladies myroure.
How and why gods service is said / each day in.vii. hours Capitulo primo.
SEpcies in die Laudem dixi tibi, Psalm. C.xviii.
These ar the words of the prophet David saying thus to our lord. Seven
times on the day. I have said praysynges to the. All reasonable creatures were
made to know / and to love / and to praise god / and therein to have their
endeles joy. But while our soulles ar prysoned in these dedly bodies / we may
not for corrupcyon and heaviness of the same bodies / entende co^tynually to y^
godly praysinge / like as they do that by death ar made free from thraldom of
the flesh / and are come to the end of their joy / that is the presence of
god Therefore our mother holy church reulyd by the holy ghost / knowing the
fraylte and feebleness o^ her children / has set us each day seven hours /
which at least we ought to occupy in the service and prayseynge of god / that
is to say / Matyns / prime / tyerse / Sexte / none / euensong / and co^plyn.
Prouer. xxiiii.
For sithe yt is so as Solomon says / that a ryghtfull man fallyth seven times
on a day / and the no^bre of all wickedness is named under seven deadly sins
agenste which in holy church is ordained seven sacraments / and given seven
gifts of the holy ghost* therefore to get remyssyon of our sins / and to
thank god for his gifts* we say prayseynges to him in the said hours /
seven times each day. And for god made all things in syx days / and fulfilled
them in the seventh day and restyd* Genes..ii.
therefore doing thankeynges to god for all his works / and for all that he
made* each day we praise him seven times. Also for the life of man is departed
in seven ages whereof we have spente some full ydelly or evil therefore to thank
god for our life / and to reco^pense such negligence* seven times on the day
we do service to god And for all ye time of this life passith under.vii. days
wherein ^he people of this world that is given to act^^e life is occupied to
get cheyrly flode and ours / so that they may not freely ente^de each day in
all these times to praise god with their tongues* therefore we that are called
to co^templatyue life / ought to praise god for the^ and for us every day.vii.
times / y^ we may say to our lord with Dauyd Lord god I praised the.vii. times
on the day Psalm. C.^viii.


why these.vii. hours / rather then other Ca. ii.
BUt now perauenture ye might ask why these seven hours / that is to say /
matins time / pryme time / and so fourth / ar rather assigned of holy church
to the praysyng of god / then other hours / sith there is many mo hours on
the day / and in the night then.vii. And to this I answer / that these
hours ar more specially priuyleged then other for great works yt god has
wroughte therein / for which he is euerlastyngly to be praised / and therefore we
read that saints both in the old law / and in the new praised god in these
hours. For David the prophet says to god of himself thus Media nocte
surgebam ad confi^endum tibi, Psalm. Cxviii
That is. Lord at mydnyghte I rose to praise the. and also he says thus.
Vespere, et mane, Psalmo. liiii.
and meridie narrabo et annu^ciabo, that is. By the morrow. at pryme time. and
at none. and at euensonge time. I shall tell and show thy prayseynges.
Danielis. vi.
Also Daniel the prophet worshyped god thryes on the day knelynge / yt was
after the exposycion of saint Hierome / at tyerse / at sexte / and at none.
super Daniel. vi Actus. iii.
Also Peter and John^ went up in to the temple to pray at the hour of none /
as yt is written in ye acts of thapostles. Actus..xvi.
And saint Paul and silas being in prison / prayed to god at mydnyght / and
then the earth quaked / and all prison doors opened / and all the fetters and
bonds of prisoners were losyd. Our lord Ihu^ christ also prayed / not only in
on part of ye night but all the night he wooke in prayer as the gospel ^ellyth
Luce..vi.
And in the beginning of holy church / the clergy and the common people both men
and women rose to praise god.iiii. times in y^ night. First in the begi^nyng of
the night / when ^olke ar wo^te to go to bed. The second time at mydnight The
third time a little before day / and the.iiii. time in the self morrow tide.
Math. xxvi
For at even / our lord was taken of ye Jews / and bound and scorned. At
midnight he was borne Before day he spoiled hell / and in ye morning he rose
from deeth to life. Sedm^ co^suetu^ dinem ecclesie Sarum.
And therefore in some feasts matyns ar yet said at even / and in some relygio^s
at mydnight. And in some before day / and in other diverse times of the night.
And in some chirches they say mattyns in the morrow tide. Math..xxvii.
At pryme tide / our lord Ihu^ crist was led to Pylate and accused / and in
the same hour after his resurreccyo^ he apperyd to mary Magdeleyne / and an
other day he apperyd to ^ys dysciples / as they were fysshyng ye same hour.
Macci.xvi.
At hour of tyerse / our lord Jesus crist was scourged and crouned with thorns
and scorned. Ioannis..xxi.
The same hour after his resurreccion he appeared to ye women co^yng from the
sepulcre. Math..xxviii.
And on Penthecoste so^day the same hour he sent the holy ghost down to
thapostles. Act..ii.
At sexte / our lord Ihu^ christ was done on the cross / and fed with eyse and
gal. Ioannis..xix.
The same hour after his resurreccyo^ he apperyd to thapostel saint James /
and on the Assencio^ day the same hour he sat and ete with his apostels. Math.
xxvii.
At hour of none / our lord Ihu^ crist cried / and gave out his soulle by
death / the same hour a knight opened our lords side with a spear / and smote
thorugh his heart / where out came water to our baptym / and blood to our
redemption. Ioannis..xix.
And on Ester day he apperyd ye same hour to seint peter. At euensonge time /
our lord Jesus crist on Shere thursday supped with his apostels / and ordained
the holy sacrament of his holy body and blood. Math. xxvi.
The same hour on good friday he was taken down from the cross. Math..xxvii.
And on ester day the same hour he met with too of his disciples going toward
Emaus / and made himself known to the^ in brekyng of bread. Luce..xxiiii.
At co^plyn time / our lord ^hu^ christ on shere thursday at even prayed / and
swette blood. Luce. xxii.
The same Math. xxvii.
hour on good friday he was buried / and on Ester day the same hour he apperyd
to his dyscyples gathered together in a close place for fere of the Jews / and
said to them Pees be to you. Ioannis..xv
Thus ye may se / that not without great causes / these hours ar set and
ordained to be specially occupied to the service and praysyng of our lord god*
rather then other hours on the day.

why our Lady ought to be praised and served in these same hours.
Capitulo.iii.
NOw in happes ye think that these ar good causes why god should be served in
these hours / but sith all your service is of our lady / ye would wytt why
her service should be said in these same.seven. hours. And as to this ye
ought to think / that yt is full convenient yt her holy service should be said
in time according to his / for her will was never contrary to his blessed will
And furthermore some say that for at matyns time there apperyth a sterre in the
fyrmament whereby shypmen ar rewlyd in the sea and bring themself to right
haven / and for o^r merciful lady is that s^er yt socoureth mankind in the
troubelous se of this world / and brings her lovers to the haven of health*
therefore yt is worthy yt she be served and praised at matyns time. At prime
time there apperyth a sterre before the son / as if yt were the leder or
brynger f^rth of the so^n / and our lady came before and brought forth to
mankind ye son of rightwysnes yt is our lord ^hu^ crist. At hour of tyerse
/ laborers desire to have their dinner and o^r lady has brought forth to us /
him that is foude / ^ bread of life / our lord Ihu^ crist comfort and
refeccio^ to all yt labor in his service. At hour of sexte / ye son waxes
more hot / and by mean of our lady the everlasting son has showed the hete
of his charity more largely to mankind. At hour of none ye son is hiest /
and the highest grace and mercy that ever was done to man in earth / was brought
in by mean of our lady. At euenso^ge time ye day fails much ^ when all other
socour fails / our ladys grace helps Co^plin is the end of the day / and in
the end of our life we have most need of our ladys help / and therefore in all
these hours we ought to do her worship and praysyng. Also the pains yt our
lord ihu^ crist suffered in his holy passyo^ in all these.vii. hours as is
before said / our lady his mother suffered the same pains in her heart by
co^passyo^ / and therefore yt is convenient to praise her and do her service in
all the same hours. There be also.vii. ages of the world. The first is from
Adam unto Noe. The second from Noe till Abraham. The third from abraham to
moses. The.iiii. from Moses unto david. The. fyfte. from David unto iechonye
The.vi. from Iechonye / to ye co^yng of our lord Ihu^ / and the.vii. from
thens / unto ye dome. And in all these ages our lady has be desired and loved
of holy faders that have be in each of the^ / as is showed more openly in the
legende of your service. On tewsday
And all the chosen of god / that ever were or shall be in these.vii. ages of
the world* ar or shall be brought to health by mean of her. And god himself
louyth her more then he loves all creatures y^ ever were or ever shall be in
all ye same ages* therefore yt is reasonable yt vii. times each day she be
worshyped and praised and our lord god for her / of all his church / and more
specially of you that are so specially called to be her maidens and daily to
sing / and to say her holy service. Cap^o. iiii. re^gule s^ti^ sal^^.


How your service and your legende / and the rewle were all given of one
spyryte. And how holy a man he was / that by heavenly inspyracyon set your song
and your service Ca. iiii
ANd so much the more dilygent ought ye to be in syngyng / and sayng of your
holy service / as it was in a marvelous wise ordenid and given from heaven / by
our lord himself / and not by any man's wit or co^nyng. For like as our
lord Ihu^ crist which is one god with the father and the holy ghost endited ye
rewle himself by his holy mouth to saint Birgit* so the same god endited your
lege^de by an angel / and your service by an holy man. This holy man was saint
Birgittes co^fessoure and her master / for he taught her gra^mer and so^ge /
and governed her and her household whose name was master Peter. Of whom our
lady said thus to saint Birgit. In extrauag. Capitulo..vi.
Say she said to thy master yt loves the holy trinite in all his power* yt I
have furtheryd him so much in to the charity of the same holy trinite / yt he
is one of the pryestes y^ god loves most in the world / wherefore it was given
unto him to endite that so^ge / which is as gold / yt shall be to many in
solace and comfort. This is the song of your service / whereof our lady said
to saint Birgit an other time thus. He yt has endited the rewle / and that
spirit yt told the / the lessons* Ibidem. Capi^ulo. Cxii^.
the same spirit gave him to endite the so^ge with meruaylous tokens and
shewynges. For there came to him so great a wind in his eres y^ his breast /
and the celles of his head were al inwardly fulfilled / in which fulfyllynge
all his heart was enflaumed to the love of god / whereof after that fulfyllynge
and enflaumynge and soft meaning of his tongue / he brought fourth the
words / and the notes. And therefore yt is not semely that they should be
shorted. For though in my song there be no masterly making ne no Rethoryke
Latynne / yet thoo words endytyd by the mouth of this my loved friend / plese
me more / then sotel words of e^y worldely masters.

How the holy ghost wroughte both by the angel / and by master Peter / but
dyuersly in e^^et of them. And what reward the same master should have for
writynge of your so^ge Ca. v
THe mother of god said to saint Byrgit. Thou ought to wit yt yt is no more
mastery to god to make of ought / and to make of naught* In extraua. Cap^o.

How an angel was sense of god to saint Byrgyt to endyte your Legende in the
congue of Sweche / which master Peter drew first our of Latin. Capitulo. vi.
When saint Birgyt had dwelled many years in rome in a Cardinals place yt

the^ for she wist not what lesso^s should be read by ye no^nes in her
monastery ye christ bad her bylde in Swethe whose rewle he endyted himself to
the worship of his mother / she prayde to our lord Ihu^ therefore / and he
apperyd unto her and said I shall se^de ye mine angel yt shall reuele / and
endyte unto the / ye lege^de that shall be read at mattyns by ye nonnes in thy
monastery in worship of ye vyrgyn my mother / and write thou yt as he says
unto ye. Then had saint Byrgyt a chamber ioynyng upon the said church of saint
Laurence / and a wyndo to the hye auter / whereby she might se ye body of
chrysteche day. I have often ben in ye same church / and there I have seen
both the auter and the wyndo. In ye chamber saint Birgit echeday after she had
said her hours and her prayers / she made her ready to write we pen and yncke
and paper or parchemyn / so abydyng ye angel of god / and when he came he stood
by her side right up most honestly. having allway his face with reverence
berynge and beholdynge toward the altar / whre the body of christ was hyd and
closed in a box as the manner is. And so stondynge he endyted the said legende
dystynctely and in order. in the moderly tongue of saint Brygytte / and she
full devoutly wrote yt each day of the Angels mouth / and mekely showed her
gostly father each day what she had written the same day. But some days yt
happened that the Angel came not / and then when her gostly father asked her
if she had written any thing that day* she answered again full mekely / and
said. Father I have written nothing to day / for I abode long the Angel of
god / that he should come and endite / and I write but he came not. Thus was
this Angels sermon of the excellence of the glorious vyrgyn Mary / endyted and
written / which the same Angel departed in lessons as they should be red at
mattyns weykely thorugh out all the year. And when he had done he said to
saint Byrgytte / lo he says I have shapen a cote to the quiene of heaven the
mother of God. Therefore so we ye yt to gyther as ye may. O how glad ought ye to
be for to sow on this heavenly cote / how dylygente and devout ought ye to be
to read / and to here this holy legend. How deep and inward comfort should yt
be to you / to sing and read and say this holy service / whereof the holy ghost
himself is auctoure and maker / that hat he given yt to you by so holy means
/ as by his holy augell / by holy saint Byrgytte / and by so holy a pryeste.
For when saint Byrgytte had written the Legende of the Angels mouth in her
own tongue* then the angel bad her take yt to master Peter for to draw yt
in to latin / and said thus unto her. Say he said to thy master that he and
I ar both one membre in god. In extranag. to Lxv.
For he is as yt were the outward membre / and I am the inward membre
Therefore write he these words that I say to the / and put he thereto / and
therefro that him semyth is to be put thereto / and therfro / as yt pleasyth him
/ for we both ar gouernyd of one spyryte. This puttyng to and fro that the
angel spekyth of / was as I trow. for a thing may not always well be turnyd
from one language in to another without some chaungeynge of words more or
less. when master Peter had turned this Legende in so latin out of the tongue
of Swethe / for he was a manborne of the same lord* then he sent yt to master
Alpho^se which was a doctoure of dyuynyte to whom our lord bad that all the
reuelacyons should be taken after they were drawn in to latin / for the same
Alphonse was borne in Spain / many an honderyth mile from Swethe / and could
nothing of her language. Ibidem. Ca. xlviii. et.xlix. Item le. vii. Capitulo.
xxxi.
And thefore they neded to be drawn in to latin or he se them. To him the
lessons and reuelacyons were taken / that he should se that they were set in
true and conuenyente terms / without error or darkness / for he was a great
clerk. And though the first drawyng were good and true / and don by the help
of the holy ghost* yet our lord would that moo men of diverse contryes and
language should labor therein / to their more merit and to more open showing
and witness of his maruaylous workeynge. In extra^ag. Capitulo. xlix.
For as he said to saint Byrgytte / though the Euangelystes wrote the gospelles
by the holy ghost / yet other doctoures came after / that by the same spyryte
dyscussed and expounded their writing much more plainly and openly / And so
yt neded to be. Therefore thus after the setting of master Alpo^se is your
legende red in all places of this order.

That this holy service ought to be said with more dylygence / and devotion
then other prayers Ca. vii.
BY all this ye may se that ye ought to be full besy in all the wits and
mightes of your soulle / to sing / and read and here the holy hours of your
service full devoutly. And more devoutly then any other prayers. Not only for
the holy ordinance / and setting thereof. as I have now told you* but also for
ye ar more boside thereto in diverse wise. Extra. de cele^ miss. Ca. do^entes.
One for the ordenaunce / and obedyence of holy church / where all that are
bound to dyuyne service ar bydden straytly in verteu of holy obedyence to say
or sing the service of these.vii. hours studyously and devoutly as f^r as god
gives them grace. For though yt be not in our power to have devotion at our
will / for yt is the fre gift of god / yet yt is in ou^e power by grace to do
that is in us to dyspose us to devotion. And the great curteyse of our
merciful lord is freely to give the gifts of grace and of devotion to them
that faithfully dyspose them thereto. And if he give them not to our felyng he
gives them to our most profyt / if the defaulte be not in us. And therefore we
ought to be right ware that we give none occasyon to our self / ne to none
other of lettynge of devotion / by herynge or saying word or token or in any
other wise. For that is for boden us / by holy church in all wise under great
pain. De celeb. miss Ca. graui in clementi.
and the prelates of the church be charged to take heed thereto. An other thing
that byndeth you to these holy hours is your foundacyon / for your fou^der
has given you your lyuelode / that you live by for that cause specially that
ye should praise god in his holy service in these seven hours. Io. in s^ma
c^se^^o^ libro. primo.^i^.vii. question. xviii.
And therefore ye ar bound of deutye and of right / sith ye take the lyuelode*
to satysfye them after their entente and else ye ar gylty of wrong wythholdynge
of your debt The third bond / ye have by the rewle of your professyon /
whereby ye ar bound to sing every day these holy hours of our lady solemply.
Ca. iiii. regule.
And this solempnyte asks both inward besynes to have devotion in heart /
and also in syngyng and redyng with tongue / and in other outward obseruaunce.
And like as ye ar more bound to this holy service* then to other prayers* so
yt pleasyth god more and is more profitable to you. For we read that the soulle
of a holy relygyous man apperyd to his abbot after his death / and bad him
exhort his brethren to say this holy divine service with all reverence and
devotion that the angels of god might offer yt up to god at time of each of
these hours. For this holy service he said that is devoutly song of relygyous
people in earth pleasyth god as much / as that / that is done of angels
before his high majesty in heaven. It is also more medefull to you / for yt
deseruyth not only the reward of prayer as other devout prayer does / but
also yt has the reward of obedience / that is better then ought that any
man can deserve by his own devotion. De opere momachorum^ Capitulo.xvii.
For after the sentence of saint Augustyne one prayer of him that devoutly
says his service in obedience of holy church* is better then ten thousand
prayers said of an other after his own will and devotion / that rechelesly
says the service that he is bound to. And therefore they err greatly / that
hastily / and rechelesly say these holy hours / for haste of other besynes /
or of other prayers. And so do they that wythdrawe their voice from singing /
for saying of other deuocyons. though they say the same thing and much more
without note. They are also blamefull that of their own will / medel other
prayers / or other besynes with these holy hours / as if any would say a
lesson or a response by himself / while other sing yt or read yt by note / and
then say other prayers / or entende to other things / and afterward torn
again and sing fourth with the quier Or if any in time of mattins / or of
any other of these hours would stynte of / and entende to other deuocyons or
to other occupacyons / and then say fourth where they left / namely if yt
were any long thing or long tareyng. For though / both this holy service and
such besynes / or devotion be good / each by themself* yet when they are
medelyd together / they plese not god. As wine and ale ar good drinks either
by themself / but and they were medlyd to gyther / men would not drink them.
Right so our lord will have his service said hole each hour by ytselfe /
without medlyng of any other thing. Leuit. xix.
Therefore he forbad in his law that any man shul sow his fylde with diverse
seeds at ones. For the sede of these holy hours ought to be sown in the
fylde of your soulles / in their own time by them self. And in other times
of the day / ye may sow the sede of other deuocions / and of other good besynes
/ as layser will give you / and if ye have no leyser thereto* then obedyence of
this holy service fulfylleth / and reco^penseth all such things much more
fruytfully of your soulles profyt / then if ye said or did much thing / and
were recheles in this And therefore though your legende be long / and a lesson
is red but of one alone / yet think not / that y^ is a void time to all the
other to do what they will. For ye ought that time to sytfull stylle and to
here each word that is red / with full great dylygence and devout entendau^ce
thereto / sekeyng to have deuocio^ therein* and to feed your soulles therwt / for
yt is fode of life / and ye ought not only to take heed to y^ ye say or sing
your self. but ye ought also to take heed and here all that is red or song
there / of any other / be yt lesson or verse / or orison or any such other
thing.

That the service of these hours ought to be said in dew time. And why your
service is said after the brothers service. Ca. viii
FUrthermore yt longs to the obedyence of this holy service / that yt be

these hours may not be said in their oune time / they ought to be said before
the time rather the^ after. Hugo sup reg. Aug. Ca. iii.
For as a holy doctoure says. Obedience will that dyuyne service be said in

for to tarry after ye time yt is he says blameful negligence. Trinet sup reg
Aug. Ca. xix.
And therefore says an other holy doctor / that god heryth redyly the prayer
and service that is said in dew time as he says by his prophet, Esa..xlix.
Tempore placito exaudiuite That is. I have herd thy prayer when thou pray^est
in dew time. This time is to be understand as for your service / soche time as
yt is said in your quier / after the use of the monastery. as the day and the
service asks. For y^ brothres service ought to be said before youres in dew
time after the common use of the church. And therefore your quier may not keep
tho same times But yt is medefull obedience / that they that are out of ye quier
say their service and hours in soche times / as they are said in the quier /
as much as they may as is before said. The cause why your hours be said
after the brothres / our lord (...) christ tellyth to saint Birgyt and says
thus. The scripture which ye call the bible / that we call the scripture of
gold* In extrauag. Capitulo.iii. Ecclesi..ix.
says yt a poor man by his wysdo^ delyueryd a City that was bysegyd of a
mighty man. And afterward no man had mind on y^ poor man. This city is
mankind / whom she send bysegyd in four sides / for he bysegyd man with four
sins / that is to say / first by inobedyence of gods commandment. The
second by trespass ageyns^e the law of nature. The.iii. by noyous couetyse /
and the forth by hardenes of heart. This creature of mankind my most holy
mother in manner delyueryd / when she left all her will in to my hands / and
would suffer all trybulacion that soulles might be saved This is verily godly
wisdom / to committee all will and power unto god / and to delight in contrary
things for god. The^fore for this will. I god. and the endeles son of god.
was made man in ye virgin / whose heart was as mine heart. And therefore I may
well say that my mother and I have saved man / as yt had be with one heart I
sufferynge in heart and body / and she in sorrow of heart and in love. Therefore
this virgin was verily pour for she desired right naught of richesse / ne the
least sin cleuyd ^euer to her soulle. For there are so^me pore from good /
but they are full of couetyse and of pride / and these are not the pore that I
mente of in my gospel. Math..v.
But other ar rich in richesse of goods / and pore in spyrite. And these ar
they that count themself but ashes and dedely / and desire to be with christ /
and they have richesse onley for need / and for profyt of their even christian.
These ar verily pore / and rich in god. And among these / was my mother.
Therefore the pouerte / and the wisdom of this vyrgyn my mother / is as yt were
forgotten. For there is but few / but that though they praise her with their
mouth / yet they cry not to her / in all their heart nor they follow not the
steps of her charity. Therefore. for in the church of god / the worship of
god is song of many / seven times on the day / after the manner of of our
forne fathers* therefore I will now / that first the brethren sing their
hours in dew times. And afterward / that the systers fulfill the office of
their service / somewhat more tareyngly. For to them is not set the seuenfolde
no^bre of their hours after ye course of ye son / but as they may / they
must do / and keep the time as they may. And this I my self ordeyne ye
endyted the rewle / that yt should be known / not only of christian men / but
also of the hethen that shall be co^uertyd / whow great worship god will have
his mother worshyped. And also for she is head and lady of this monastery / by
whom I will do mercy to sinners. And also that the scripture should be
fulfilled that says I shall praise god in all time / and in all my life.
Psalmo. xxxiii
Thus this synguler grace is not to be refused for a lynguler good / does no
preiudyce to a general good. Ne the praysable custom of fathers is not
therefore to be repreued* but yt plesyth me yt in other chyrches / the hours of
ye vyrgyn my mother be said first / and that then after be song the hours
of the day after the times set / and ordained in holy church. By this
reuelacyon ye may se / that not wythstondynge the use of the church is in many
lands and co^tres / to say first the service and hours of our lady / as less
worthy. and afterward the hours of the day as more worthy* yet our lord will
do ye reverence to his holy mother / that in this order the hours of her /
shall be said after the hours of the day to her most worship ye may also se in
this same reuelacyo^ that though ye may not keep the times used of the church
for causes before said* yet ye ought to keep the times as much as ye may /
in soche wise as I have said before

This holy service ought also to be said in dew place / that is in the church

/ and go up to offer our prayer to god. And therefore says saint Bernarde.

the fe^des have less Genes. xxviii.
Q terribilis est locus iste, That is. How ferefull is this place. For the

There was a great and a worthy clarke that left the world / and becam a
relygious man in the cite of Paris and kept the rygoure of his relygio^ in
full great streyghtnes unto his lives end. Netheles by cause of his clergy
he was lysensyd by his abbot to be absent fro the quier to entende to his
study / whereby he co^pyled and made full many notable books to the profyt of
all holy church. But after he was deed and buryd / on a night as ye abbot
stood at mattyns with his brethren / he se one sto^de in this deed man's stalle
/ ye lowly enclyned to him and by sign asked confession. Than the abbot
vndersto^ding that it was ye same man's soul* he went with him out of the quier
in to the chapitre house / where the soul was take a non and sore tormented
long time to gidre And after his torment he apperred again to his abbot and
then the abbot asked him the cause of his pain. He answerid and said. For
dyuine service / by cause I fulfilled yt not in ye quier night and day as othrr
brethern did Then said the abbot. Thou gadrest and made many books out of holy
scripture / and have left them to ye profit of many other y^ shall come after
the. And for that cause I gave the leave to be from divine service The soul
answerid and said An unlawful leave is not leave / but it is violence of ye order
for such lysence should not be granted but seldom / and only when need
co^pelleth The abbot asked him what might deliver him from his pain* and he
said a trentalle of masses song for him in the covent / which was done / and
the soulle was delyueryd by the mercy of our lord Jesus christ. Thus ye may
se that though this man's labor were good and done by leave: yet yt excusyd
him not from pain for yt was not needful ne longing to the obedience or
profyt of his relygion. But they that would lever be in the quier then thense /

Capi. xi.
Therefore they that have health and strength and are not lettyd by obedience*
they ought to be full hasty and ready to come to this holy service and loathe to
be thense They ought not to spare for any slowth or dulnes of the body / ne
yet though they feel some time a manner of pain in the stomach or in the head /
for lack of sleep or indygestyon. For they that quycly arise for love of
gods service / and fervently dyspose them thereto* they should find our
lords help / and often find them self better at ease sone after both in
body and in soul then if they lay for favor of the flesh still or withdraw
them thense. Forlyke as they that stir up themself with a quycke and a
fervent will thyde^ ward / ar help fourth and comforted by our lords good
angels* right so fendes take power over them that of slowthe keep them thense
/ as ye may se by example of a monk that was suffycyently strong in body but
he was slepy / and dull to rise to mattyns. Often he was spoken to / for to
amend / and on a night he was called sharply to arise and come to the quyer.
Then he was wroth / and rose up hastly and went toward ye pryue dortour. And
when he came to the door / there was ready a company of fendes co^ynge to him
ward / that cried agenst him with ferefull noise and hasty / often saying and
cryyng. Take him / take him / get him / hold him. And with this the man was
suddenly afraid / and turned again and ran to church as fast as he might /
like a man hal^e mad and out of his wit for dread. And when he was come in
to his stalle / he stood a while trembelyng and pantyng / and sone after he fell
down to the ground / and lay still as deed a long time with out felyng or
sturyng. Then he was borne to the farmery / and after he was come again to him
self he told his brethren what him eyled / and from thense fourth he would
be in the quyer with the first. And so I trow would other that are now
slowthefull / if they were hastyd on the same wise. But yt is to dread least
they be worse treated in their soulle of the same company / and feel yt not /
and therefore they amend not. But alas what shall soche do at that hour when an
innumerable company of fendes shall com against them / and they shall not know
whether to fle ne ren from them. Therefore yt is holsom to fle by times from
their service / and to run hastily and spedyly to our lords service. And
when ye are there* none ought to go out till that service / or hour be done
that is begone / without the greater need. For like as the fend is besy to
let folk / that they should not come there. Right so labors he when they are
there to make them to go out / or to haste them thense. Hereof spekyth saint
Gregore in his dialogges. Libro secundo Capitulo. iiii.
where he tellyth that saint Benet had many abbeys under his governance. And
in one of them was a monk that could not abide in the church in time of
gods service. But often times when other were most besy in prayer / he went
out and wandryd about / or did some other occupacyon / when his abbot had
often warned him / and he amendyd not* he led him to saint Benet / and he
blamed him sharply / and then he amendyd a day or tow / but the third day he
turnyd again to his old manner. Then came saint Benet thither himself / and at
service time when all gave them bysely to prayer and devotion: he se how a
little black boy / took that monk by the lap / and led him out of the quyer
/ and how he arose anon / and went after him. Then said saint Benet to the
abbot and to an other holy monk called maure. Se ye not who yt is yt draws
out this man* They said no. Then they prayed two days and maure se / how the
fend in lykenes of a little blake boy drew fourth the monk / but ye abbott
might not se yt. The next day when the service wos do. saint Benet went out /
and found the same monk standing without. And then saint Benet took a rod
and bette him well / for the dulnes and blyndenes of his heart. And fro that
day fourth / the blake boy was no more his leder / but he abode stabely in the
quyer and in prayer with besy devotion. Thus while the monk was beten / the
fend was driven a way. And by this ye may se / that yt is the fendes business
to make folk go from the quyer in time of gods service.

For when his enemies came agenste him in so great power that he wyste well he
might not by man's power wtstonde them* he ordained syngers of gods service
to praise god / and to go before his host singing. And when they began to
praise god* god tornyd tho enemies each of them agenste other / and each of them

So we read of king Roberte of france that was a co^nyng man / and so devout
toward gods service / that he would be in each feast in some monastery for
dyuine service. And not only he would sing with the monks* but also he would do
on a cope and stand and sing as a chantoure in mids of ye quier / whereof it
happened on a time when he beseged a castle that was rebel agenst him / and the
feast of saint Anyan fell to be the same time at Orleau^ce* he left his host
at sege / and went thither and took a cope and song in the mids of ye quier
as he was wo^te to do. And when he came to Agnus dei / and had bego^ne yt
thryes with an high voice / knelyng down at yche time on his knees* the walls
of ye castle that was beseged fell down suddenly to the ground. and so the
castle was dystroyed / and his enmys ouercomen. And thus ye may se / yt there
is no better armure of defense agenst all enmyes* then devout syngyng of our
lords service / wherefore David the prophet said thus Laudans inuocabo dominum
et ab inimicis meis saluusero, Psalm. xv^^
That is / I shall call upon our lord in praysynge* and so I shall be safe
from all mine enemies. For yt has not been seen / that ever any place
myscheued. where gods service was devoutly kept. The seuenthe profyt of holy
church song is / that yt pleasyth Sonet voxtua in auribus meis. Canti.

that ys^ Thy voice may sou^de in mine eres. Glad then ought ye to be / to sing
that song that god himself desires to here. But so yt ought to be long /
that it sou^de well in to his eres for else yt avails but little. For he
takes more head of the heart / then of the voice. But when both accord in
him / then is yt best. And if either should fail / yt is better to lack the
voice / then the heart from him. Therefore they that would praise god with voice
of singing / and can not or may not* our lord will hold them excused / so
they say devoutly such service as they can / and keep their hearts clean in
mekenes and in obedyence. For as our Lady says to saint Byrgit. Libro tercio
c^pitulo primo.
A clean heart and a meke / plesyth god in scylence as well as in syngyng. And
therefore as we se that all members of one body have not all one workyng / for
the eynese / the eres here / the tongue spekyth the hands warke / and so each
does that longs to him / and helpyth other. Right so ought each of us to
help and to bear other / and to do as we can and may in the calling that god
has called us / and to serve our god with the gifts that he has given us /
that in all things he be worshyped in us all.

same Pharao / and upon all his / and drowned them euerychone / wherefore Moses

After this many other both me^ and wymen filled with the spirit of god made
songs and psalms to ye praysyng of god / and specially the king and prophet
Dauyd / whom god chose fro chyldehod to yt great gift / that he should be
prince of syngers of gods meruayles / and maker of psalms to our lords
praysynge, These songs and psalms ar wri in the psalter book which ar said
and song in the service of holy church / oftener then any other book of /
that is to say the Jews / which were gods special people / used most to
sing these psalms in the temple of god. An other cause is / for example of
penance In prologo s^per psalmo.
For as saint Austyn says. All that the old law. All that the prophets /
and all that the gospel and the new law bydde and ordeyne is contained in
these holy psalms / and therefore he says the syngyng of them pleasyth god
much / for all that is in them / longs to his worship / what he says may be
found in these psalms / that is not in ye profyt and edyfycacyon of mankind
/ what degree or age or co^dycyon that he be of* Each man and woman and child
young and old / may find in these psalms that shall teache him / and that
shall delight him. For psalms he says comforts the heavy / and tempereth them
that are merry / they appese them that are wroth / and they refreshe the pore /
they warn the rich to know themself and not to be proud / and so they give
able medycyne to all that receive them. They despise not sinners* but they
offer and give them wholesome remedy of penance. For our lord god has made a
drink by his seruante David / which is sweet to taste / and effectual to
hele the wounds of sinners by his verteu. This drink is these psalms / that are swetely hard when they are so^ge / and they go thorughe the heart when they
delight. Much more is said in praysyng of these psalms / which I leave to
write here for lenghte. The holy pope called Damasus / ordained yt these
psalms should be so^ge one verse on the tone side of the quier an other on ye
other side. For a holy bishop that was ye third of antioche after saint Peter
hard angels on an high mountain sing psalms in such manner* quier to
quier / and so was that manner of singing first begone in greece / and after
ordened to be kept in the church of Rome as is before said. How hympnes and
ante^pnes / and responses and such other were made and ordained / and set to
be said and song in holy church / by holy saints and popes / and general
conseylles. I hope yt nedyth not much to write here to you. For ye have nigh
all such things made and set to you of new in your service / in such a
marvelous and gracyous wise / as I have said before.

That the hours of this holy service ought to be song and said in clennesse
of conscience Capitulo..xiiii.
TO the manner of syngyng of your hours / long many things. First yt they
be said with clean co^seyence. For if any erthely lord love to have tho
servants yt ar next about him honest and clean in all their governance and
array* much more yt longs to the lord of lords to have his servants clean
without fylthe of sin / namely them that are called to be co^tynually occupied
in his holy praysyng / and therefore says the prophet David Deo nostro sit
locu^da, decoraque laudacio, Psalm..C.xlvi^
That is / to our god may be given joyful / and fair praysynge. And here is
fair and joyful / well set to gyther. For there may no soulle verily joy in
ye praysyng of god / but if yt be first made fair / and cleansed from sin.
wherefore he that has remorse in conscience of dedly sin / and therwt says
/ or syngeth gods service* he synneth in the sayng. De celeb. mi^^ capitulo
grau^ in Clement.
And yet if he left yt vnsayde he should sin more greuosly / what shall he
then do sith he synneth both in the doing / and in the leueynge Thus shall he
do. He ought to repent him of his syn and to be in full will / and purpose to
shryue him thereof / and to amend / and so lowly meke him to god / and ask him
forgyuenes. And then trustyng in our lords mercy he shall say his service with
sorrow of heart / and with mekenes and dread. For he ought not to think yt he
is in dedly sin when he is co^trite and sorry thereof. Libro secundo. Capitulo.

And hereof ye have a notable example in saint Maudes reuelacio^s / both for
divine service / and for howslyng That like as a man agenst a lords coming to
him makes clean his house / and if he may not for have / cast out all ye
uncleaness before his entrey / the^ he swepeth yt up together in to a corner
and castyth yt out afterward. Right so when a person goyth to dyuyne
service / or to the howslynge / and felyth grudgeyng in conscience / if he may
not get his gostly father to shryue him / then he ought to sorrow his sins in
his heart by contricion / and to shryue him thereof to god and so swepe yt in to
a corner of his mind till he may get his confessor / and trusting in our
lords mercy / go to his service or to his howslyng. This is to be kept in all
times / and in all sins as for dyuyne service. It is also to be kept in
your howslynge / as for such daily defaultes / or neglyge^ces as ye are not
syker that they are not dedly. But and any know himself gylty in dedly sin*
he owght not to be howsled till he be shryuen. An^ also of dyuyne service / if
any feel remorse of dedly sin / wyttyng well that yt is dedly sin / if he
may esely get his confessoure or he begin his service* he ought to be shryuen
before / and to take his penance. For true shryfte of mouth with absolucion
following lyghtyth much a soulle / and gives conforte and hope of forgyuenes /
whereby he may the more freely and devoutly praise god in his holy service /
while he felyth him self clean and sewre in conscience.

That the heart ought to be kept in time of these holy hours from distraccion
/ and thinking of other things. Capitulo.xv.
THE second thing that longs to the dew manner of sayng or singing of this
holy service is the stable keeping of the heart and of the mind there upon so
that ye give all your entendaunce thereto / and to none other thing for that
time. Super cantica ^mont. xlvii. in tine.
For as saint Bernarde says / we ought not in time of our Lords service /
to occupye our mind on holy scryptures / ne none other thing be yt never so
good / Much more then ought we to beware / that we let not our mind ten
upon well and vain things in time of this holy service. For right as bodily
meat is not right profitable / but if yt be well chewyd in the mouth and
swolued in the stomach* So this holy service / but if yt be well chowed in the
mind / and sauerly felt in the heart / yt fedeth not the soulle suffycyently.
and therefore says saint Bernarde that yt profyteth but little / to sing only
with the voice / or to say only with the mouth / without entendaunce of the
heart. Super psalmo Qui ha^itat. sermon.xvi.
For as Isidore says. Libro tercio ^e su^mo beno Ca. xii.
Prayer longs to the heart / not to the lyppes. For god takyth head to ye
heart / not to the words. Therefore they that say their service / and occupy
their mind there while on other things / ar like to a man that pays his
debt with false money / that seems gold or silver without / and is coper or
bras within / which contentyth not his lord that he pays yt to / but rather
provoke him to dysplesaunce. For he that wylfully / and of purpose occupyeth
his mind in time of these holy hours about other things / and takyth not
head what he says or syngeth. Or if he give stead wylfully without need by
herynge or by seeing or in any otherwise to any thing whereby he is distracte
fro mind and aduertence of ye service that he says / though he say or
syngfully all words* to. in cap^o gr^ni in clement^
yet he pays not treuly his debt ne pleasyth not god therwyth. but he
offendyth him and synneth grievously. And he ought to do penance therefore and
to say the same service again with better entendaunce. But this doing of
penance both here and in other places after* vnderstandyth repentance of
heart and shryfte / with fulfyllynge of such penance as his goostly father
enioyneth him. For yt standyth in his dyscrescyo^ to enjoin him penance for
his negligence / and therwyth to enjoin him to say the same service again. or
other thing instead thereof both in this case / and in other like that follow
after / as him seems most spedefull to his soulles health. Inno. de celeb.
miss. ca. pmo.
Nethelesse if he have said the same service again or he come to shryfte: then
he shall not be enjoined to say yt again. But he shall have penance only for his
first myssayng. to. in capitulo graui in cleme^
But he that dressyth his heart to god at the beginning of his service with will
and purpose to keep his mind stable thervpo^ though yt happen him afterward
of negligence or of fraylte to be dystracte in his thoughts from that he
says / beside his first purpose / if he abide not wylfully in such
thoughts / after he has perceived them / but turnyth his mind again to his
service and is sorry thereof* then he is not bound to say that service again.
But it is good that he meke himself and knowledge his negligence in sheryfte /
other generally or specially as the matter askyth.

what causes dystraccyon of the mind in time of gods service and what
remedies ar to be used there agenste. Capitulo.xvi.
BY this ye may se that ye have full great need to labor about keeping of
the mind in time of these holy hours / and to be full well ware of all
occasyo^s that might cause any scateryng or dystraccion thereof. And therefore ye
shall understand yt there be four things that cause much soche unstableness
of heart in gods service. The first is besynes and occupacio^ before / about
De su^mo bono libro tercio Capitulo. vii.
For as Isodore says / when ye mind has been applied to such worldely or
ydel / or unlawful thoughts / by herynge or speaking / or thynkeynge or in any
other wise / and so from thense goes to prayer / or to gods service* anon
ymaginacio^s of the same things come to his mind / and stop ye enter in to
devout prayer / that the heart may not freely dress up yt self to heavenly
desire ne abide upon that / that the tongue says / or syngeth. The remedy
agenste this lettyng. is / that a man labor not only in service time / but
at all time to keep and to stable his mind in god / and to keep him from
ydelnes and vanyte / both in thought in word / in herynge / and in seeing
and in other wise. And if he be nedefully occupied about any worldely / or
outward besynes* that he depart therfro a certain time / or service begin
/ and labor by some devout excercyse of prayer / medytacyon / or redynge to
gather and to stable his minds to gyther and so to make him ready before as the
wise man byddeth / and says. Ecclesi. xviii.
Ante orationem prepara animam tuam, that is. Before prayer make ready thy
soulle. For he that should harp / or make other mynstralsy before ye king* he
would be besy to make ready his instruments before. And much more ought we to
make ready the harp of our heart / when we shall sing / or say the melody of
our lords praysynge. The second service is negligence of keeping of the heart
in time of the same service / which is roted by long and yuel custom / and
so the frail and wretched soulle is bound / and borne down / yt yt can not
stir up yt self from wandryng and vagant thoughts that yt is accustomyd in
/ as a man that rennyth downewarde from an hye hyl* he may not stynte himself
/ after he is ones going till he comethe to the vale. Right so they that have
used their heart to run downewarde where yt will upon erthly or vain
things* they can not lightly stynte yt / ne gather yt to stablenes. Sup Ioh.
trac..xlix.
For yuel custom as saint Austyn says / byndeth a man and as a burden beryth
him down. And for this vagacion is caused of dulnes / and of heaviness of heart
or else of slouthe / by which a dullarde list not to labor about the
keeping of his own heart / till he be fallen in such yuel custom / that he
can not lightly break away therfro* therefore the remedy agenste this / must be
other sharpenes of dread / or quycknes of hope / after the soulle is dysposed.
For he that is light hearted / and vain of condicyons / needs in this case to
use his mind bysely in thoughts of dread of his death of his dome / and of
pains beholdynge therwyth what pareyl he stondyth in / if he co^tynew
rechelesly in such wandryng of mind unto his death which shall come he woteth
not how sone. This dredful beholdynge often and depely used / and contynewed /
may in short time by grace / make him to restrain / and to gather to gyther
his flowing thoughts / from all vanytyes. But they that are disposed to great
heaviness and dulues / need in this case not only to sharp himself with dread /
but also to behold the great goodness and charity of our mercyful lord and
the presence of him / and of his holy angels in time of his service / and so
to quycken up their heaviness / and learn to delight them in our lord / and so
to stable the mind in him as the prophet says. Delectare in dn^o, et dabit
tibi petitiones cordis tui. Psalm..xxxvi.
that is Delight the in our lord / and he shall give the all that thine heart
will ask or desire, For he that felyth very delight in him* desires nothing
but him / in whom he may have all that him needs. The third Sermon quarto
de Ieinnio.
For as saint Bernarde says / the more effectual and spedeful that prayer is
/ if yt be done as yt ought* the more felly / and bysely labors the
malycyous enemy to let yt. Remedy agenste this / is to make upon your breast
pryuely and contyneually in such times the token of the cross / with strong
and steadfast faith. And patiently and perceuerantly to labor to keep / and
to hold your mind upon our lord / and upon that ye say or sing. And ye
shall feel that the these shall fle a way as if he were smytten with a staff as
saint James says. Iacobi..iiii.
Resistite diabolo, et fugiet a vobis. that is. wtstande the fend and he shall
fle away from you. But and any give stead to his sturrynges at the beginning
and play with such vagante thoughts as he labors to put in his mind* then
he will take hold on him / and brydel him on his yuel manner and led his heart
to as much lewdenes as him list. And therefore beware and inwardely ware and
drive him a way be times.

Of them that are vain or troubelous in time of gods service and let both
himself and other. Capi xvii
BUT this malycyous serpent when he sees that he is thus chased of many and
dryue^ a way / he seeks to enter again by an other way. For the^ he assayeth
to get hold in some one whom he sturrethe anon / to make some vain chere
or sing or token / whereby one or other and some time many ar meued to some
manner of dyssolucyon / and so dystracte from the sadness of inward deuocyo^. An
other he sturreth to make somwey ward token or to do some thing comberously
where thrughe other ar tarried in their minds and troubeled / and so their
spyrytes ar driven from quyetnes of devotion in to anguysshe / and paynefull
grudginges. Then but if they haste the^ the faster to their armure / and
begin to give battle to such vain or troubelous sturrynges and labor to
gather and hold their mind to gyther as I said before* or else the subtle
enemy will enter upon them again And therefore such vain or comberous people
ar the fourth cause / that make dystraccyon in gods Vos ex patre diabolo
estis, et desideria patris vestri vultis facere, Joan..viii.
That is. ye ar children of the father the fend. And ye will do the desires of
your father. If a king were at meat and his servants about him to serve
him. Or if he were in the feylde to fight / and his knights with him to war
for him. Or if he had labors in his vineyard or in his gardyn / and there
came one and made his servants and his knights and his labors to be
skatered and to fly from his service. Should not such one be called a traitor
to the king / and be put to does* How much more parlously ar they traitors
to god / that other by vanyte or by trouble / cause dystraccyon in his holy
service / and make the minds of his true knights and labors be all to
skatered. These ar bad fellows for they let the common profyt of all their
felyshyp. Like unto thorns and briars that will not suffer ye corn that
grows amongst them to bring forth fruit. But a non as yt would grow up /
they oppress or strangle yt and bear yt down. So these folks when gods
servants ar besy to grow up / by holy desires and deuocyo^ in his service*
they with their vanyte or troubelousnes pulle down their minds / and let
them. Therefore yt is good that such thorns be ware of that our lord says by
the prophet Spine congregate igne comburentur, Esaie..xxxiii.
that is. Thorns gathered together shall be cast in to fire and burnt Remedy
ageynste this is / that the gyuers of such occasyon be sadly blamed with all
dylygence of charity till they amend / for therewith ar the prelates of the
church charged by the comone law / as I have written above. Capitulo. vii.
A another remedy is / that all that are occupied in our lords service / be
full ware and besy to keep their syghte / and all their outward wits from
all occasyons that they take no head of any thing but only of that holy
service that they have in hand / so that they take none occasyon / ne bring
in no tidings to the heart to occupye their mind with all. But that in all
their berynge / they keep ye sadness of relygious dysciplyne. For soche sobre
and sad outward keeping so yt be done in troth / and not feigned* helpyth
much to ye inward stablenes of the heart / as the scripture says. Ecclesi.
primo.
Religiositas custodiet et iustificabit cor, that ys^ Relygyousnes shall keep
the heart / and make yt ryghtfull.

Of them that are light to speak or to sleep in time of gods service
Capitulo.xviii
Amongst these other letters of our Lords holy hours* ar spekers and slepers
namely they that are light to speak / for they let other as well as themself /
and give occasyo^ of yuel. How perylous this vice is / ye may se by these
examples. Cesarius in dialog. did. xii. Capitulo. vi.
There was a young religyous vyrgyn about ten year of age in ye order of
Cystews whose name was Gertrude / which after her death / came again on a day
at euensonge time when all the Covent was in the quyer / and enclyned low
before the hye auter / she came in to her place there she was wont to stand in
the quier / and at the end of euenso^ge of our lady / she fell down prostrate
/ till all was done and then she rose / and we^ther ways None saw her but a
another maid of the same age / yt was wont to stand by her in ye quier which
was aferde and told yt to ye Abbes / and on the next day by byddyng of the
Abbess she asked of the same virgyn when she came again and said unto her.
Sister Gertrude good sister Gertrude from whense come thou now and what do
thou amongst us after thy death Then she answered and said I come hither to
make amends for my trespace / for I rowned to the in the quyer half words /
and therefore I am byden do satysfaccion in the same place / and but if thou be
ware of ye same vice / thou shalt suffer the same pain after thy death. And
after she had appeared so four times* she said Sister I hope I have fulfilled
my penance from hense furthe yt shall no more se me / and so she went to
bliss. But take ye head sith this young maid of ten year of age / was
punysshed so / for half words* what shall they suffer that are of greater age
for hole words spoken in time of place of silence. It is also read of saint
Seueryn archebysshop of Colyn / which was so holy a man yt he hard angels
sing / when saint Martyn dyed many hu^dereth miles fro him and gat by his
prayer that his Arche deacon hard the same so^ge. This same saint Seuerine
apperyd after his death to ye same archedeacon / arrayed in his bysshopes array
and standing as yt had been in ye air between heaven and earth / and above his
head was as it had been a cloud of fire sparkelyng and dropyng upon his head and
upon all his body. Then said the archedeken unto him. Art you not my lord
Seueryne / he answered and said ye. and the Archedeken asked / what is that /
ye I se art you in fire* he said / ye am I. Then the archedeken said / we
worship the sir he said as a saint and thou suffer so great tormente* saint
Seueryne answered. This I suffer / for in syngyng of gods service in ye quier
I was more neglygente the^ I should have be. For whiles my clerks so^ge ye
service of god / and I was p^sente with them* sometime both my servants and
other came to speak to me of diverse nedeful thenges and I intended to them /
and gave the^ answers / the archedeken said / sir I trow yt be no great
tormente yt thou suffer / and when he had said so* a drop of ye fyry
cloud fell upon his arm / which brent ye flesh a non unto the bone / and he
cried a mine arm mine arm / then said saint Seueryne unto him. Dread yt not
for now shall you se. notwtstondyng my pains / how much I may do agenst god /
and then the holy bishop lift up his hand and blissed his arm. and anon yt
was hole / so yt he felt never pain thereof after. Here ye may se what pain
they deserve ye ar bound to syle^ce and without need speak in time of our lords
holy service* while this holy bishop yt was not bound to silence of relygio^
/ was thus grievously tormented / for hespake in time of these holy hours
things yt were nedeful. Of them yt ar dull and slepy in gods service / we
read ye saint Bernarde se an angel with a sencer go al about ye quier and sense
the^ yt prayed and so^ge devoutly / and passed forth by them that were slepy
and neglygente. Of an other holy man we read / that was on a time oppressed
with heaviness of sleep in our lords service. And there came an angel in
lykenes of a reverend person / and took him by the breast and drew him out of
the quyer / and while he was thus drawn he began to a wake and opened his
eyes / and saw him and said / what art thou sir he said / and why drawest
thou me so. He answered. And why slepest thou so* whither come thou to
church to sleep or to wake* And a non he was gone / and the goodman drove
sleep from him / and was more ware to keep himself waker in gods service
always after.

THE third thing is / that longs to the dew manner of saying of these holy
hours is to say them with besy entendau^ce. Sugo. Capi. iii. and Trivet. ca.

For god list not to here his prayer / that hereth not himself ne takyth not
head to here his prayer. that heryth not himself / ne takyth not head to that
he says. And therefore byddeth saint Austyn in his rewle and says when ye
praise god / or pray with Capitulo second
psalms or hympnes* think in your heart on that same thing that ye say with
your mouth. This thynkyng and entendaunce in the (...) / may bein.iiii manner

understanding. And this is sometime sauory / sometime barayne / after ye shall
feel much comfort and grace of devotion thereby. And then ye must be full
ware in keeping of your self after / that ye lose not rechelesly such grace
and devotion as ye have received in time of your service / lest yt be
wythdrawen from you an other time for your own defaulte. And also yt is
spedefull for getting of such devotion* to take some little layser before the
beginning of each hour for to stir up the heart to god. For as a holy father
says / therefore ar we so cold / and dulle in gods service* for nether we are
quykened before in deuocyo^ / new are not ware to cast from us vain thoughts
in the beginning / and to stable our mind in god / and upon that we say. And

/ and co^uenye^tly say that / that lacks / as when they can yt not by heart
or have no book ready or no co^uenyente time to say yt fourth with* than they are not bound to say yt. Netheles if yt be a great part of the hour / or many
psalms / or soche other then is well done to say yt. But and the late coming
be of slouthe / or of negligence. or though yt be for thing of obedyence / so
yt might be done in other time* they ought to do penance therefore. But they
ought not to begin the hour / and abide of sing yngetyll they have
overtaken yt quyer / but they shall sing fourth with them / there where they
found them. Juno. wi supr
But for they ought not to wythdrawe their voice from singing / and also for
such saying might be occasyon of dystraccyo^ or of lettynge of other Now
think yt not that I am about to make laws and ordenaunce upon you by this
writing for I do not so. But I write to your enformacyon what the law of holy
chyrce / by sayng of doctors ordenyth and dysposeth to be kept / in sayng of
dyuyne service / of you and all that are bound thereto. Furthermore / they that are so sick that they may not say their service ne here yt* ar excused thereof
for ever. For they are not bound to say yt / after they are recovered for there
is no law set to bind them that are sick Netheles if they may and will say yt
afterward of devotion* yt is not yuel. But for to say yt of such conscience /
as if they must needs of dewse yt were neither praysable nor expedyente. But
they that are not so sick / but that they may say or here their service
without any hurt or pareyll / and yet leave yt of slowthe and of negligence*
than they are bound both to say yt after / and to do penance for the
leueyng. If any be in doubt whether he might have said yt or no* yt is good in
such case to be gouernyd by the counsel of a dyscrete gosty father lest the
dome of his own conscience be other to scrupulous or to recheles.

Of hasty sayng of these holy hours and of ouerskypynge. Capitulo.xx.
AND for yt is so great parel to leave ought of this holy service / as is
before said* therefore all that are bound thereto / ought not only to
acustome their heart to have mind thereon / but also to use their tongue to
say yt tretably and dystynctely / without faylyng or ouerskypynge of word or
sylable. For like as a good harper smytyth all the strings in his harp each
in his own kind / and if he smote the first and the last / or if he smote
rechelesly over all at ones / he should make no good melody. Right so gods
service is lykened to the song of an harp as the prophet says. Psallite
domino in cithera, Psalmo. 97.
that is. Sing to god in the harp. And therefore in this harp of our lords
service / ye ought to smite all the strings / that is to say all the words
and syllables each in his kind. and in his place / and not rabble them out
together as though ye would say them all at ones. For the praysynge of god in
his church / ought to accord to his praysynge in heaven / whereof saint John^
in the Apocalypse after he had hard yt. he said thus. Et vocem quam audiui
sicut citharedoru^ citharizanciu^ in citharis suis. Capitulo. xiiii.
that is. The voice that I hard in heaven / was the voice of harpers harpyng in
their harpes. Therefore when Aaron by our lords commandment offered a calfe
upon the altar / he cut yt in gobettes. Leuite..ix.
and then offerde yt up with the head / and with each member thereof. By this
calfe is understand the service of our lords praysyng. which is much more
acceptable to him / then the offering of any calfe / as the Prophet says.
Psalmo. lxviii.
Laudabo nomen dei cum cantico, et magnificabo eum in laud, Et placebit deo
super vitulum nouellum, that is. I shall praise the name of god with song / and
I shall make much of him in praysyng. and yt shall please god more then the
offering of any young calfe. But when this calfe of our lords praysynge is
offered / yt must be cut in gobettes / for all the words and syllables ought
to be said dystynctely from the beginning unto the end / in each member and
in each part thereof. For like as clyppers or falsers of the kings money are
punysshed by death* Right so they that clyppe away from the money of gods
service / any words or letters or syllables / and so false yt from the true
sentence / or from the true manner of saying thereof* deserve to be grievously
punysshed agenste god. And therefore the fend sends redely his messengers to
gather all such neglygences to gyther and to keep them in accusynge of the
soul as we read of an holy Abbot of the order of Cystreus In scilogio.^^. ix.
Capitu. vii.
that while he stood in the quyer at mattyns / he saw a fend that had a long
and a great poke hanging about his neck / and went about the quyer from
one to an other / and waited bysely after all letters and syllables and words
/ and faylynges / that any made* and them he gathered dylygently and put them
in his poke. And when he came before the Abbot / waiting if ought had escaped
him / that he might have gotten and put in his bag* the Abbot was astoned
and aferde of the foulenes / and mysshape of him / and said unto him. what art
thou* And he answered and said. I am a pour dyuel / and my name is Tytyuyllus
/ and I do mine office that is committed unto me. And what is thine office said
the Abbot / he answered I must each day he said. bring my master a thousand
pokes full of faylynges / and of neglygences in syllables and words / that are
done in your order in redynge and in singing. and else I must be sore beten.
Thus ye may se / that though such faylynges be sone forgotten of the^ that
make them* yet the fend forgets them not / but he keeps them full bysely
in sure store / to accuse y^ soul therewith at our lords dome / wherefore yt is
good to know the cause of such have and negligence / and to Esaie. xliiii.
Laud mea infrenabo te. That is. I shall brydel the with my praysyng. Another
the coldenes of their own heart. The third cause Sermon sexto de Assentione.
For saint Bernarde says / that holy delight of devotion flies from the heart
that is occupied with worldely besynes / for troth may not be medlyd with vanyte
/ ne endeles things. with things fayleynge. ne spirytuall things / with
flesshely things / ne high things / with low things. For thou may not he
says sauoure both at ones tho heavenly things that are above / and erthly
things that are beneth. Therefore as Crisostome says / he that will keep the
commandments of god / he needs to despise the wylles of the world.

what entendau^ce ought to be had about the song of these holy hours. Ca.
xxi.
THE forth thing that longs to the dwte of this holy service / is to take heed to the song / which is the least of all the other before said. For why
oe there is three things in gods serluyce / that is to say. The sentence /
the word / and the song. the notes and so^ge serve to the words, and the
words serve to ye inward sentence And all three both sentence. word. and
song / serve to stir ye soulle. to love. and to worship and to praise god
and to have joy and devotion in him. And therefore all thentendaunce / that
should be had about the song* ought to entende to this end. and thereafter
to be demed. For ye ought not in singing to seek pleasaunce of voice / ne
delight you in swetnes of the self song / ne in high song. ne in curyous
syngyng ne in no manner of vanyte. but only to seek co^puncy on for your sins
/ and deuocyo^ in god. and in his holy mother / whose praysyng ye sing. In
regula. Ca. xxxviii. et Capitulo. xlvii.
And though yt be so / that as saint Benet says / such ought to read and to
sing / as may edyfye the herers* yet yt is not expedyente to have any respect
in the heart toward the herers. For that so^ge that is song most devoutly
toward god* edyfyeth most all other tho ye think right naught on them. and
the less ye think on them by fleing of vanyte / the more ye edyfye. It is
necessary to take heed in singing / that all the notes be song / as they are
in your books. each of them in their own town / and that the mesure of
singing / be euenly set and kept. But all this ought so to be rewlyd /
that the spyrytes of all be kept in rest / and that deuocyo^ in god. be
furthered thereby and not let. And therefore each one ought to have an ere to
other. so if any dyscorde hapen* each one be ready to give stead to other. And
not one haste fourth ward / an other draw backward / but all ought to sing
to gyther and accord to gyther / that as ye ought to be all of one heart / so
ye praise god / as yt were with one voice.

How this so^ge of this holy service ought to be meke and sad without all
vanyte and curyosyte. Capitulo. xxii.
THERE is neither singing / ne redynge that may please god of it self / but
after the dysposycyon of the reder or synger. thereafter yt plesyth / or
dysplesyth. For our lord takes head to the heart and to thentente / and not
to the outward voice. And therefore they that rejoice them by vain glory / or
delight them in the swetnes or plesaunce of their own voice / they please not
god with their singing / but they offend him. and please the fend. For saint
Gregory says / that when pleasant voices be sought* sober life is forsaken.
And therefore the fend has so great enter in this vice. Cesarius in dialog.
did. xii. Capitulo.iiii.
that sometime he vsyth yt himself. As we read that there was ones a clarke.
that had so sweet and ^ayre a voice / that many had delight to here him sing.
But on a day when a relygyous man hard him sing / he said yt was no man's
voice. but a fendes. whereof all folk were ameruayled, Then the holy man
coniured him before them all / and he anon left there the stynkeynge body that
he appeared in / and went his ways. Therefore the more pleasant and fayrer
that any bodies voice is* the more besy ought they to be about the keeping of
the heart in mekenes and in devotion / that yt may plese in gods syghte.
Cesarius in dialogis. did. iiii. Capitulo.viii.
For yt is written of a monk that was in the same abbey / where saint Benet
was Abbot / that he had a voice most pleasant and sweet. This monk hallowed
ones the Paschall on Ester even / and song so swetely the song of the
halowynge / that yt sowned to the eres of all that herd him / as if yt had be
a melody most sweet and delycyous. But he had himself such delight and vain
glory therein* that anon as he had done / the fendes took him to them both
soulle and body / in so sodeyne and marvelous wise that no man wist how / ne
where he became. Here by ye may se how perylous yt is to any body to delight him
other to his own voice / or in the outward song. Libro.x. Capitulo.xxxiii.
For saint Augustyne says in his confessyons / that as often as the song
delyteth him more then the inward Sentence of the thing that was song / so
often he knowleged that he synneth greuosly. Libro.vi. Capitulo.xxxv.
And our Lord Jesus christ showed to saint Byrgytte / how the spyryte of
vain glory accused the soulle of a relygyous man. at our lords dome. for his
high and vain syngyng / where the fend said thus to him. He song he said
for vain glory / and for a vain name. And when his voice fell any thing
down. and waxed weary* then I lift yt up hyer / and came re^nynge gladly for to
help him. And so for this and for other sins / ye wretched soulle was
dampened. Like to this in party I read of a young monk of Cystrewes / that of
pride / and of self will. Cesarius in dialogis. distinc. v. Capitulo.v.
when the psalmody was begone in a mean voice* he set yt three notes higher.
and though so^me of the elders would have song fourth as yt was begone* yet
he with the help of other yt favored him / prevailed agenste them / and held
fourth his own. And they gave stead But anon yt was seen openly how the fend
coming out of his mouth in lyknesse of hot brennynge yren* entered in to
all his helpers. Therefore as a man that clymbeth high fails fotynge and hold
sometime / and so fallyth and breketh his neck. Right so such high syngers.
that fail fotyng of mekenes byneth. and have no hold of devotion above /
fall down by pride / and break their necks gostly. For like as every note of
meke and of devout song shall have a special reward of god* right so the
fend marketh every note of such proud so^ge / to have ye syngers punysshed
therefore. I Would. dis. quar^ Capitulo.ix.
For on a time / when clerks sange in the quier with high and loud voice a
relygyous man saw how the fend satte on high with a great sack in his lift
hand / and with his right hand he put therein all their voices and song And
when the service was done / they made great joy and gladness among them / as
if they had praised god with their song right well. And then the holy man
said to them / ye have song fast he said and ye have filled a great sack
full. They asked him what he mente / and he told them what he had seen. and
then they were ashamed / as much as they were reioysed before. And therefore
our mercyful lord Jesus christ wyllyng that all such song should be excluded
from this order* he byddeth himself that your song should not be curyous /
ne high / ne vain but in all wise meke. sad. and sober / sayng thus to our
holy mother saint Byrgyt. In extrau^^ Capitulo.iiii. Exodi..xv
Have you not read that Moses sister for the great miracle yt was done in the
red see / went out with vyrgyns and women syngyng in tympanes / and in cymbals a
song of joy unto god. So ought my mothers daughters go out of the red see.
That is to say / from the couetyse and plesaunce of the world / having in
the hands of their works tympanes that is to say / abstynence from flesshely
lust / and cymbales of clear praysynge / whose song ought not to be
slowthfull / ne broken / ne dyssolute but honest and sad / and according in
one / and in all wy^e meke. Following the song of them that are called
charterhowse. whose psalmody sauouryth more the swetnes of the soulle / and
mekenes and devotion* then any vain showing outward. For the heart is not
clean from sin / when the song delyteth more the synger then the thing that
is song. And yt is in all wise abhomynable agenste god / when the lyftynge up
the voice / is more for the here is then for god These ar the words of our lord
Jesus christ. ^^bi supra.


How ye ought to dress your entente in saying / or singing of this holy
service. Ca. xxiii.
THE fyfte thing that longs to the dew manner of saying of deuyne serui is to
take heed to what entente ye say yt. For thentente gives every good deed his
right name. So that if the entente be good / the deed is good / and if
thentente be yuel. the deed is yuel. But yuel deed may never be made good / be
thente never so good / all though yt may be the less yuel / when yt is done
of good entente. But to say or sing dyuyne service is a good and an holy deed
yt self* and therefore if yt be well done. and to good entente / then is all
good Therefore ye need to take heed / that nether ye sing ne say this holy
service for vain glory / as they done that will be taken as holy and devout.
Ne for vain pleasaunce as they do / that seek to plese other thereby / or
desire to behold lovers of gods service. Ne for vain dread as they do /
that would not come there / save for dread lest they should be shent Ne for
vain shame / as they do that come thydre. for they are a shamed / but if they
do as other do. But ye ought to do yt only for god / and for good intent so
that though no creature should here you / ne se you but each of you by your
self alone* yet ye would be never the less dylygent and devout to sing yt /
and to say yt and to come thereto. And for as much as all that god asks of
man / is contained under one conclusyon of charity / that stands in love of
god and of our self / and of our even christen as our self* therefore yt is
needful that not only in gods service / but in all that ye do / ye entende
our lords worship / and the health and profyt of your self / and of all
your even christen. And for all your service is of our blessed Lady* therefore
yt is good that ye entende specially therein / her praysyng and worship and that
god be thanked and praised for all the gifts / and benefytes that he has
given to her and by her to all mankind. And farthermore for that this holy
service is not set of your self but by holy chryche* therefore yt is
expedyente that ye entende to say yt in unity / and in obedyence of holy
church and to theffecte and entente that god of his church has or denyd yt
to be said and song. For so may yt always be accepted and hard. ye ought
also to entende the fulfyllynge of your founders entente / that was to the
health of his own soulle / and of his progenitors / and of all christen
soulles. In regula Capitulo.xxxi..
and specially for peace and welfare of all this land / after the byhesle of
our lord Jesus christ in reuelacyo^ to saint Birgytte / where he behoteth
that in each land where any Monastery of this order is founded / there shall
be encresed peace and accord. It is also spedefull / ye ye entende in saying
of this holy service* ye fulfyllyng of your bond and duty / in as much as
ye ar bound thereto by your rewle / and by your holy professyo^ And for the
prayer of these holy hours is rather sped and hard of our lord / then other
prayers as I said before* therefore yt is good that in the saying. or singing
thereof* ye entende to get forgyuenesse of your own sins / and such help
and graces / and vertewes as ye feel needful to you / and also to the health
and profyt of all that ye ar bound / or have devotion to pray for. And the
more specially and often that ye offer up these ententes to god / with meke and
fervent desire in him* the better and sooner speed shall ye have of that thing
that ye desire and pray for. Netheles ye ought to dress your hearts after
these ententes or ye begin / for in time of this holy service ye ought to
stable your mind only in god / and upon the same service / and upon none
other thing as I have said before.

Of reverence and devotion / that ought to be had in this holy service both
inward and outward. Capi..xxiiii
THE syxte thing that longs to ye dew manner of saying / of these holy hours
/ is to take heed that they be said with meke reverence / and devotion / both
inward in heart / and in all outward obseruaunces. as in knelynge.
enclynynge. sitting and stondynge. and in sad and reuerente keeping* of all the
members of the body / much more then if ye were in p^sence of any erthly
king. or queen / or other erthly creature / as ye that are there in the
presence of almighty god to do hynt service / both with body and with soul.
like as he made both to that same end Therefore the holy obseruaunces / are
not only to be kept of them that sing in ye quier. Ex regula bell Bndicti.
Ca. l.
but also of all other / to their power where ever they say their service. For
a relygyous person ought to be governed relygiously over all. whether he be
alone / or with other and what ever he do. and namely in sayng of this holy
service. Netheles they that have no co^uenyent place to keep all obseruau^ces /
and therefore say their service in co^tynuall and reuerente knelynge. or sometime
stondynge* I trow they are excused. But for to say yt sitting or lyeng /
without need of syknes or walking up and down* yt were a token of little love
/ and of little reverence to god. Libro quarto. Capitulo.8^.
For our holy mother saint Byrgyt had in reuelacyon / and wrote to a seculer
clarke that such walking to and fro in service time / is a showing of an
unstable and a vagant heart / and of a slow soul. and of little charity and
devotion. And sith yt is so in seculers. much more yt is blamefull in
relygyous. And therefore tho books that say how some have most deuocyo^ sitting
/ or else whether yt be sitting or knelynge or going. or standing. a man
should do / as he can feel most devotion* such saynges / ar to be understand
of tho prayers and deuocions / that a man chosyth to say or do after his own
will. But in our Lords service. we ought to labor for devotion / in such
manner of saying and of obseruau^ce / as holy church and relygyo^ has ordenyd
to be kept therein. And yt is greatly to take heed / of yt holy obedyence whereby
the Pope in the co^moun law of holy church / that gyth them that are bound
to say the holy hours of dyuyne service* Extraua. de celebracio^e miss
captlo dole^tes.
that they say them studyously and devoutly. For by the wound of orginall
sin and by our own actual sin / and yuell custom / the corrupt body is
so heavy / and loathe to all verteu and the heart so unstable* that wythou^
great inward labor / and without we do a manner of vyole^ce to our self / we
can nether make the rebel and inodedient flesh to do reuere^tly* ne gather
the mind in onched to feeling of deuocio^. And therefore the Pope byddeth that
this holy service should be said studyously. For study is a great and a
vyolente applyeng of the heart to do a thing with a great and a fervent will.
And therefore first he says studyously and then devoutly For but if your
heart be set sadly / and inwardly to study about the stablynge of ye mind in
god / ye can not sing ne say his service devoutly. And this gostly study may
not be done shortly. ne now done and now left* but yt must be continued full
bysely and abydyngly / every day. and every hour and time of the day. For he
that in other time let his heart ^^^ where yt will / and weneth that he shall
keep his mind upon his prayer or service when he comes thereto he shall find
that yt is not in his power. Therefore after our lord Jesus christ had said in
his holy rewle that neither gold / ne silver ne precious stones should be our
tresure / but the grace of god should be our richesse* Capitulo.viii.
he said that this treasure of grace must be kep^e with contynuall studyes /
with devout prayers / and with godly praisynges. Take heed what order our lord
keeps in his words. First he says study / and then prayer / and then
praysyng. For inward gostly study techeth to pray. and co^tynuaunce of this
study causes to pray devoutly. and devout prayer brings gostly strenghte
and comfort in the soulle whereby yt is lift up and restyth / and delyteth in
love and praysynge of god. And while the soulle is thus occupied* the treasure
of grace is kept full seurely therein. And therefore this gostly study to keep
the heart / is your chyefe labor / this is your most charge and gretest
bond / this makes the soul to be virtuous. and this causes all the outward
beryng to be relygious. Prouerbio. iiii.
As the scripture says. Omni custodia serua cortuum, quia ex ipso vita
procedit, that is. Keep thy heart with all dylygence / for thereof comes thy
life. For if the heart be well kept / all ye life is well And if the heart be
yuell kept / all the life is yuell. Therefore without besy and ware keeping of
the heart nothing may make a man very relygyous. For as yt is written in Uitas
patrum. when hethen philosophers met with relygyous fathers in deserte* ye
philosophers asked them. and said / what do ye that we do not* ye fast and
live in abstinence. and so do we / ye despise all erthly good and live in
pouerte. and so do we. ye love to be despised. and to have mekenes and pacyence
and other verteues* and the same do we / what do ye then more then we* The holy
fathers answered. we trust in god. and keep our heart / keep our heart said
they again. may we not. That may ye not do And why* For they knew not god. and
the heart may never be kept but only in god. For there is nothing that may
fylle the soulle but god alone. But for god is one. in whom is all* therefore
all scaterynges of the mind may be oned in him. And for he is only more then
the soul* therefore a lonely in him the heart and soulle is rested on each
side. Therefore be ware that ye live not rechelesly. go day / come even. and so
spend your time in vain. and your labor with out fruit. but inwardly and
bysely / and co^tynewally travail in this spyrytuall study to stable the heart
in god. namely in time of this holy service. And for charity pray that I may do
the same. For though yt be a labor amongst all labors. thus to keep the
heart* yet yt is in all wise needful. and also yt is full medefull as the
scripture says. Bonoru^ laboru^ glorio sus est fructus. that is. The fruit
of good labors is glorious / therefore so to labor in our lords holy
service / that we may come to ye glorious fruit of endeles reward. grant us
by prayers of his mercyful mother / our merciful lord Jesus christ. Amen.

stories and first how ye shall be governed in redyng of this Book and of all
other books.
Devout redyng of holy Books. is called one of the parts of contemplacyon.
for yt causyth much grace. and comfort to the soulle if yt be well and
dyscretely used. And much holy redynge is often lost. for lack of dylygence.
that yt is not intended as yt ought to be. Therefore if ye will profit in
redynge* ye need to keep these five things. First ye ought to take redynge
god spekyth to man. and therefore he ought reverently to be herd. And also
meke reverence had to the word: causes grace. and light of under (...) dynge
to enter in to the soulle. whereby y^ soulle (...) and feleth more openly the
troth of the word. and has the more comfort. and edyfycacyon thereof. And
therefore says the scryp^^^ Esto m^nsuetus ad au^iendum verbum dei vt

that is to say. Beth^^ meke and mylde to here the word of god that thou
understand yt. As if he said. But thou (...) in herynge and redynge the word
/ thou mays^e not be sewre of the true understanding thereof. For our lord
Jesus christ says in his gospel. Math. xi.
that the father of heaven has hyden the mysteryes and trouthes of his

sauourly and openly to ye vndersto^dinge of the here is. And y^ may they not do*
but if they understood yt. and sauoure yt first themself. The.iiii. thing
that is to be kept in redyng. is yt ye dress so your entente. Regnu^ dei no^

And if ye feel yt your life is rewled in (...) dynge to that ye read* then ye
ought h^rtely and mekely to thank our lord thereof. that is ^euer of all
gooddes. and to pray him with a feruente desire. that ye may co^tyneu and encrese

lack such vert^ues governance as ye read of* then need ye to be right ware
that ye pass not rechelesly fourth over as though ye roughte not thereof. But
ye ought to abide there upon. and inwardly sorrow for yt defaulte and lack that
ye se in yourselfe^ and besely to keep in mynde^ lesson that so shows you to
your self, and oft^ to read yt again. and to look there. and on your self /
with full purpose and will to amend you and to dress your life thereafter. In
this wise. ought ye to read the first part of this book. which enformeth
you to understand. (...) kn^we how ye ought to be governed in saying, and
syngyng and redyng of your deuyne service. Other books there be yt ar made to

And some tell of the foulnes and wretchedness of syn. to stir up the
affeccyons of hate and lothynge there agenst. when ye read these books. ye
ought to labor in yourselfe inwardly. to stir up your afffeccio^s
accordingly to the matter yt ye read. As when ye read matters of dread. ye ought
to set you to co^ceyue a dread in yourselfe. And when ye read matters of hope /
ye ought to stir up yourselfe to feel comfort of the same hope. and so
fourth of other. Netheles yt is expediente that each person use to read. and
to study in this manner of books / such matters. as be most conuenyente to him
for the time. For if any were drawn down in bytternes of temptacyo^. or of
trybulacyo^ yt were not spedefull to him for that time. to study in books of
heaviness and of dread. though he felt himself wyllyng thereto. but rather in
such books as might stir up. his affeccyons to comfort and to hope And so
is yt to be said dyuersely. after the diuersyte of dysposycio^s that persons
ar sturred with for the time. Secu^da part.. 98. de exhortato^ibus Patru^
For yt is written in Uitas patru^. that when fendes had long tempted an holy
man* at last they cried and said unto him. Thou have overcome us. for when we
would lift the up by to much hope / thou berest down thy self in dread. and
sorrow of thy sins. and when we would bring the in over much dread and
heaviness / then thou rerest up thyselfe to hope / and comfort of mercy. And so
we can get no hold on the There be also some books. that treat both of
matters. to inform the understanding. and also of matters to stir up the
affeccio^s. Sometime of the tone. and some time of the the other. And in redynge of
such books. ye ought to dyspose you to both as the matter asks, and as I
have now said before. And in this wise ought ye to read the second part of
this book For therein is your understanding informed to wit what your service
menyth. And in the self service your affeccyo^s ought to be sturred. sometime
to love and joy. and praysynges of our lord Jesus christ. and of his most
holy mother / sometime to dread. sometime to hope. and sometime to sorrow. and
to co^passyon and that specially on friday. where is made mind of our lords
holy passion and of the co^passyon of his blessed mother our lady. Also in
this second part. the first word of each Antempne. and of each hympne. and
of each responce. and verse. and so fourth of all other / is written in latin
with Romeyne letter that ye may know^ thereby where yt begins. And the self
english of all the same latin following. is imprynted with a smaller letter.
And that is the exposycyo^ of the latin. And by this dyfference ye may know
which is the bare english of the latin / and which is put thereto for to
expound yt. And therefore they that se this book and read yt / may better
understand yt. then they that here yt / and se yt not. Also when this second
part is read openly in the Couente. yt shall not need always to read the latin
namely where ye matter hangs to gither. as yt does in your legende and in some
other places. For yt should in manner let the understanding from ye herers. And
therefore yt is enough to read only ye latin in ye beginnynge of each lesson.
And not in ye beginning of each clause of ye lesson. But in other places of
your service. where ye matter hangs not to gyther. but each thing is diverse
in sentence from other. as ar the Antemnes / and responces. and other like*
there yt is well done to read the first word in latin as yt is written For the
layn is written so / in the beginning of teache clause that ye should redely
know. when ye have the latin before you. what english lo^geth to each clause
by yt self. And also when your legende is read at mattyns. if any would in
ye mean time have the english before her / and feed her mind therewyth.
then the latin that is written in the beginning of each clause of the
english. should help her much / and dyrecte her that she may go forth with
the reder clause by clause. For else she should not know by the english a
lone where the reder of the latin were. This lokeynge on the english while the
latin is read. is to be understand of them that have said their mattyns or
read their legende before. For else I would not counsel them to leave the
herynge of the latin. for entendaunce to the english. And for asmoche as yt
is forboden under pain of cursynge / that no man should have ne draw any
text of holy scripture in to english without lycense of the bishop
dyocesan. And in diverse places of your service ar such textes of holy
scripture* therefore I asked and have lysence of our bishop to draw such
things in to english to your gostly comfort and profyt. so that both our
consyence in the drawing. and youres in the having. may be the more sewre and
clear. to our lords worship / which keep us in his grace. and bring us to
his bliss. Amen.

HEre Begins the story and Service of the Sunday, and first of rysynge to
mattyns,
Mien uses in land of war to keep contynuall watch in Cytyes and Castelles
and walled towns. and when any enemies come nyghe. they ring a certain bell.
whereby all men ar warned to arm them and to make them ready / and to go to
places of defense to fight and to beat of their enemies. On the same wise. we are closed in this holy Monastery. as knights in a castle where we are beseged
with great multitude of fendes that night and day labor to get enter and
pocessyon in our souls. and often they are most besy in nights time ^ when
the wits ar oppressed with heuynce of sleep. for to assaye to overcome. or
at the least to vex and to trouble them of whom they might not have the
ouerhande by day. And therefore when we here the belle ring to mattyns. we
ought a none as true gods knights arise quycly and arm us with prayer. and
make us ready by dressynge up of our entente to god. with some deuou^e
medytacyon / and haste us to the place of our defense that is the church.
which is ferefull to the fendes our enemies as a place of defense. And there
we ought to lift up. the long spear of ^eruente desire of our hearts styeng
up to god. and draw out the sharp sword of the word of god in his holy
service. and s^iyte great strokes by devout sy^gynge and ^ayeng thereof /
whereby our enemies shall be rebuked. and we kept sewre in godly praysynges.
under the baner of his proteccyon. This redynesse of coming ought not only to
be kept at mattyns. but at every hour of the day. for though we rest some
time fro singing or praynge with the mouth. our enymyes rest not to war
agenste us. And therefore we ought not to cesse of keeping of our mind s^abely
on god always. and in time of prayer to be ready and glad to go thereto / as to a
castle of socoure. and as to the fode and gostly comfort of our soulles. And
when ye come to the church before the beginning of each hour. ye say a Pater
noster. and an Aue maria. knelynge. And that is for to stir your hearts to
more devotion. or ye begin your service. And therefore yt is said in
silence. showing that god is more pleased with the preuy devotion of the heart.
whereto ye ought pryncipally to entende in all your service* then with the
outward noise whyth the voice In this Pater noster. are seven petycyons. forto
get seven gifts of the holy ghost. and seven verteues. whereby we may be
delivered from the seven dedly sins. and so to come unto the seven
b^ssednesses. The exposycyo^ of this holy prayer ye have in diverse books.
which if ye study bysely to understood will give you cause to find great
comfort and devotion in the sayng thereof. But I will tell yt you shortly like
as ye may so^what ye better have yt in mind when ye say yt. if ye will labor
theraboute.

PAter noster, That is. Our father. Think now that as a ^hylde goes trustely
to his father in what disease so ever he be in: so ye in what disease or
trouble. or temptacyo^. or sin that ever ye be in* mekely and trustely lift
up your hearts to god your father. and tell him what you eyleth. and say to
him. PAter noster, Quee father. ye say not my father. but our father. whereby
we are informed to have great charity. and love each to other. and to all our
even crystens. in as much as we are all children of one father. to whom we say
all. Pater noster, Our father. Qui es in celis, That art in heuens. Therefore
lift up your hearts from erthly. and vain things. and offer them to him.
that is not only in heuens above in bliss. but also in the soulles of his
seruauntes^ by grace^ which ar called heuens. And in each place he is by his
being. and by his presence. and by his power. Think then where ever ye be.
that god your father is p^sente before you bynethe you. with you. and all
about. and in each of your allers hearts. by grace. that is out of deadly
sin* and in this beholdynge say to him with great love. and joy. and
reverence. Our father that art in heuens. Sanctificetur nomen tuum, Thy haule
be hallowed. that is. The worship and love of thy holy name be so confermed and
stabeled in our mind that what ever ye thynke^ or say or do* we more cure
move entende the holiness and praysynge of thy holy name. and not the danyte
of our own name. And that our life may be so holy* that thy name be hallowed ^
worthyped thereby in us. And father that yt may be thus. Adueniat regnu^ tuum.
Thy kingdom ma^^come. that is. The lordeshyp of all sin may be so cast out
of us. and thou may so reygne in us. by grace. and plente of all verteues. that
we be (...) to desire thy coming in fullness of thy kingdom. at the day of
dome. or at the end of our life. And also that thy kingdom may so com to them
that are in purgatori that they be delyueryd from all pain. and come to rest
in joy of thy kingdom. And so in this petycyon. ye ask that god should
reygne in you. and in your even christian by grace. And that both ye and other
quycke. and dead. should come to the kingdom of bliss. Fiat voluntas
tuasicut in celo et in terra, So be thy will done in earth. as yt is in heaven.
that is. As thy saints that are in heaven are co^formed in all things to thy
will* so give us will and strenghte to desire and to fulfill thy will in all
things. be yt never so contrary to our vein wylles. so that if thou will
have us in syckenesse / or in tribulacio^ / in well or in woe. in heaven. in
earth. or in hell / thy fatherly will be done in us. Think not that our
father will have any of his children in hell. But our obedyence to our father
ought to be feruente and simple. that we take no head of heaven ne of hell.
but only of the fulfyllynge of our fathers will. Panem nostr um quotidianum
da nobis hodie, Give us this day our daily bread. that is. The sustenaunce of
our bodily life which thou sendest us* grant us to take yt soberly without
surfe^. and pacyently without grudgeynge and give us suffyciently thereof to our
need. And the bread of thy word give us this day / by sauory devotion in thy
holy service. and in prayer and in all redynge and herynge of thy word. Give
us father the bread of thy grace. whyth which we be comforted and strenghted
to withsto^de yuell. and to do good And give us such faith. and charity. and
devotion in our souls that thereby we may receive every day the bread of thy
holy sacrament of the altar. that is lord Jesus thyselfe. in ye unite of thy
church* though we receive yt not eueryday with our bodily mouths. Et dimitte
nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus de bitoribus nostis. And forgive us
our trespasses / as we forgive our trespassoures. This peticio^ seems heavy
to them that behold other men's sins. and forgette their own. But and wese
clearly. how great and many our sins ar agenste god. and how little in
regard thereof any offense is, that is done agenste us* we should think yt a
petycyon of vnspecabel comfort that by forgyuenesse of so little and few* we
may get forgyuenesse of so many and so great. I have sinned ageynste god.
and deserved pain. another has sinned ageynste me and deserved punysshyng if
I forgive the offense and not the pain. my father my god. shall do the same to
me / if I forgive pain and all* so shall god my father forgive me. Glad
therefore ought we to be. when any trespace is done agenste us. in word or
deed. and more glad to forgive yt and with heart. and word. and there. and
deed. to love them. and to do for them. For by them we have occasyon to get
of god our father. the large. and greatly desired pardon of forgyuenes of all
our sins. and of all pains that we have deserved therefore. The great
comfort of this petycion that yt gives to a sinful soulle. can not lightly
be told. For he is truth that byddeth us pray thus. and it may not be in
vain. but as we forgive. we should be forgyuen. who might come to a better
fair* How might we make an esper change. then to forgive. and be forgyuen A
how well were me. if many folk. had trespased ageynste me. that I might
forgive. and be forgyuen Therefore dyspose we thus our self. and say we in
great faith / and hope. Forgive us our trespaces / as we forgive our
trespassoures. And if we be in will to forgive. and feel contrary sturrynges
in our self* yet say we nevertheless that same petycio^ trustely to our father
thynkeyng thus. Grant us good father verily to forgive our trespassoures* as
we desire to be forgyuen of the. Et ne nos inducas in temptacionem, and led us
not in temptacyon. that is. Suffer us not for our unkindness. and demerytes.
to fall to sin by any temp^acyon. This is a petycyon heartily to be asked.
For none may profyt in verteu without temptacyon. ne none may wythstonde any
temptacyon be he never so parfyt. without special help. and grace of god. And
therefore pray we our father ferefully and desyrously by this petycyon. not to
keep us from temptacion. but to keep us that we fall not by any temptacyon.
Sed libera nos a malo. But deliver v^ from yuel. we can neither. ne may not of
our self. any thing do but sin. new can / or may any thing deserve. but
pain. And therefore mekely and dredfully knowing our own feblenesse. we pray
our father to deliver us from yuel of all sin. and of all peril. and of all
pain temporal. and everlasting. Amen. this word. Amen. is a word of
hebrew. and some time yt is a word of affermynge. and is as much to say. as
Treuly. or Faithfully. And some time yt is a word of desiring. and is as
much to say. as So be yt. or Be be yt done. And so is yt set here. for to
show a great desire that we ought to have that all that is asked before in
this prayer be fulfilled. For in these seven petycyons. is asked all that is
nedeful to us / to body and soulle. in this life. and after Thus may ye have
your mind on this prayer when ye say yt. if ye will study. and labor to
understand it. and keep yt in mind. Not that ye shall have mind on all the
words that I have written. but on the sentence. For the understanding of man
namely. when yt is lyghtened by grace. may co^ceyue more in a little while. then
the tongue may speak in much longer time. And therefore while ye say the words
of your Pater noster. I hope that your understanding shall the better be
fed with the inward sentence. as I have now written. at the least with some
thereof. if ye will do your deuoyre. And for as much as our sauyoure made this
prayer for our health* yt is good that ye entende always to say yt to
thentente that he made yt for / and to ask thereby all things that he intended
should be asked thereby when he made yt.

AVE MARIA. Luce primo.
This salutacyon is taken of the gospel of the gretynge of the angel Gabryel.
and of Elyzabeth. and yt was the beginning of our health And therefore this
word Aue. spelled bakwarde. is Eva. forlyke as Eues talking with the fend
was the beginning of our perdycion. so our ladies talking with the au^gel
when he gryte her with this Aue. was the enter of our redempcyo^. And so Eua is
turned in to Aue. for our sorrow is turned in to joy. by mean of our lady. For
Eua is as much to say as woo. and Aue is as much to say as Joy or without
woo. Therefore mekely. and reverently thankyng this glorious quien of heaven. and
mother of our savior. for our delyuerau^ce* say we devoutly to her Aue maria.
Hayle mary. Marye is as much to say as Sterre of the sea. or lyghtened. or
lady. For all that are here in the sea of bytternesse by penance for their
sins. the ledyth to the haven of health. Them that are rightful. she
lyghteneth by encresynge of grace. And she shewyth herself lady and Emperesse
of power. above all yuel spyrites in helping us agenste them. both in our
life. and in our death. and after. Therefore we ought often. and in all our
needs. call bysely upon this reverent name Mary. For as the same marcyful lady
says to saint Byrgit. Libro primo. Capitulo..ix.
when angels here that glorious name. they joy. and they that are in
purgatory. herynge that name ar comforted. and gladded. Ryghtful men are
strengthed the more / by more nere assystence of angels to them. by namynge of
yt holy name. Fendes trembel for fear. when they here this dreadful name. And
there is no sinner in earth so cold from the love of god. but that if ye call
upon this most helpy name Marye with that entente. that he will turn no more
again to his sin* the fend flies a way fro him. and never dare come
again to him. but if he fall again in will of deadly sin. Therefore both
for love. and worship of our most reuerente Lady. and for our own profyt*
say we often and deuoutely. AVE MARIA, Hayle Mary. Some use when they here the
fe^de named in play or in wrath to say Aue maria. that like as he ioyeth of
the vycyous namynge of his own name. so is he rebuked. by namynge of this holy
name maria Gracia plena. Full of grace. Diverse saints had diverse gifts of
grace. but never creature had the fullness of all graces. but our lady alone.
For she was filled in body and in soulle with the lord and gyuer of al graces.
and therefore yt folowyth. Dominus tecum. The lord is with the. For with her he
was in her heart by excellence of grace. and in her reuerente womb. taking
there a body of our kind. Benedicta tu in mulieribus. Blyssed be thou in all
women. and above all women. For by the. both men and women arrestored to
bliss everlasting. Et benedictus fructus ventris tur Jesus. and blyssed be
Jesus the truyce of thy womb. Blyssed be the womb. and blyssed be the fruit
thereof. which is life and fode to angels in heaven. and to men in earth. that
is. Jesus. that is to say, Sauyoure. For he has saved us fro sin and from
hell. he sauethe us daily from the malice of the fend. and from perils. and
he has opened to ve ye way of endelesse salvation. therefore endelesly be that
sweet fruit blessed. Amen. So be yt. Some say at the beginning of this
salutacyon. Aue benign Jesus. and some say after Maria. matter dei. with other
addycyons at the end also. And such things may be said when folk say
their Aues of their own devotion. But in the service of the thyrche. I trow
yt be most sewer. and most medefull to obey to the common use of saying. as
the church has set. without all such addicions If ye will say the Exede at
the beginning of matyns. and of Complyn. yt is well done. by cause ye say yt
not at Pryme / ne at Co^plyn as the use of the church is in other service. And
what this Creed is to mean. I hope with our Lords grace to write. when I
come to the mass Creed.

THEN after these prayers ye arise. and turn you to the altar and enclyne. in
token that ye ente^de to say that h^ly service to the only worship and
praysynge of our lord. and of his glorious mother our lady. And then ye
bliss you with the sign of the holy cross. to chase a way the fend with
all his dyscoytos. For as Crisostome says. Super Math. omelia.lv.
where ever the fendes se the sign of the cross. they fly away dredyng yt as
a stafte that they are beten with all. And in this blyssynge ye begin with
your hand at the hedde downewarde. and then to the lift syde^ and after to
the right side. in token. and byloue yt our lord Jesus christ came down from
the head. yt is from the father in to earth be his holy incarnacio^. and from
the earth into the lift s^de yt is hell. by his bytten passion. and from thense
unto his fathers right side by his glorous ascencio^. And after this. ye bring
your hand to your bres^e. in token yt ye ar come to thank him. and praise
hym^ in the enderest of your heart for tho benefytes. But fee as much* as
nether ye. ne any other creaturs in earth is suffycient or worthy dewly to
praise ye glorious quyne of heaven. that is the reverent mother of god. and lady
of angels* therefore first at the beginning ye ask her leave to praise her and
say. Digna^e me ^^udare, etc, that is. Holy vyrgyn vouchesafe (...) I praise
the. And for the fendes are ever besy token her praysynge / as thing that
turns them to their great shame and reprefe / by cause that the medenesse of
ye cleue vyrgyn overcome them in all their pride therefore ye ask help
ageynste them. when ye ye say. Damithi virtutem, etc, that (...). Give me
strenghte agenste thine enemies. Then trusting that she has given you leave*
ye begin to praise her. with the aungel Gabryel. sayng in reniembraunce of
the joy of the incarnacyo^ of our lord Jesus christ. in her most reuere^te
womb. Luce. primo.
Aue maria, etc, that is. Hayle marye full of great ou^ lord in with the.
Benedicta tum mulieribus Blyssed be thou above all women. and blyssed be Jesus
the fruit of thy womb. when ye have this begone with our lady and found
comfort in her. ye begin to desire to praise our lord god. But for yt feel
your self unworthy. so much as to open your mouth thereto. therefore ye pray
him to open your lyppes. to his praysynge and say. Psalmo. l.
Domine la^ea mea aperies, that is. Lord thou shalt open my lyppes. Etos meum
m^ciabus. etc. and my mouth shall show thy praysynge. This verse is only said
at mattyns. that is the beginning of gods service. in token that the first
opening of your lyppes / or mouth. should be to the praysynge of god. and
all the day after / they should abide open. and ready to the same. and be so
occupied and filled therwyth / that nothing contrary to his praysynge might
enter in. or out thereby. But for ye may neither say. need any thing well. any
time of the day. without his help. as he says himself in his gospel. Joan. xv.
Sine me nichil potestis facere, that is, with out me ye may do right
naught. Therefore both at mattyns. and at beginning of each hour. ye ask
his help. Psalmo. lxix.
and say. Deus in adiutorni^meum intend. That ye^ God take heed unto my help.
And for as much as he that is in doing of a thing. and may not bring yt
about. has need of hasty help* therefore felying your need. ye pray our
lord to haste him. and say^ Domine ad adiuu^andum me festi^^, that is. Lord
haste the to help me. And take heed that all this verse. both that part.
that is said of one alone. and that. that is answered. of all together* ar
said in the singular number, as when ye say mine. or me. and not our. ne vs^
in token that ye begin your praysynge and prayer in the person of holy
church. which is one. and not many. For though there be many members of holy
church. as there is many christian men. and women^ yet they make one body. that
is holy church. whereof christ is the head. And for that prayer that is said in
the person. and vuy^e of holy church. is never left vnspedde* therefore
truslyng that our lord has hard your prayer. and is come to help you. ye
begin all to gyther. lowly enclynynge to praise the blyssed trynyte, and say.
Gloria ^atri et filto et spiritui sancto, that is. Glory be to the father. and
to the sone. and to the holy ghost. One glory to all three. For tho three
persons is one god. This word glory is u^ common english. and therefore ye
shall understand yt glory is called a good fame often spoken of with praysynge.
Therefore when ye bydde glory to the father. and to the son, and to the holy
ghost* ye ask and desy^t that the blyssed trynyte should always be praised
and thanked. and worshyped. for his endeles goodness that is in himself. and
for all the benefytes. that he has done. and does. and shall do to his
creatures. both in making of creatures in the beginning. and co^tynuall
keeping of the^ in their being. and in the parfyt end that he shall bring all
thing to. And therefore ye add to. and say. Sicut erat in principio. That is
As^y was in the beginning. and now and always. and without end. Amen. And
for ye shall not in this praysynge delight you in melodye of the song. or of
the notes. ne in your own voices. but all your joy. and delight must be
set only in god* therefore anon after Gloria patri. ye say. Alleluya. that is
a word of joy. and praysyng. and specially yt betokens that vnspecable joy.
that is in heaven endelesly in praysynge and lawdynge of god. Therefore
praysynge our lord with such goostly joy as ye can have in him here. and
desiring to praise him in everlasting joy* ye say. Alleluya. Doctoures says
that. Alleluya is as much to say. as praise ye god. or the praisyng of god. or
lord make me safe. or sing praysynge to god / or father and son and holy
ghost / or light. life. and health. But for yt is a word of joy* therefore in
time of penance. that is from Septuagesime till Ester. yt is left. and in
slede thereof ye say. Laus tibi domine rex eterne glory. that is. Lord
praysynge be to the. King of endelesse bliss. For though penance doing be
praysynge to god. yet yt is done in sorrow of heart. and sharpness of body.
and not in gladness and joy. namely for sinful people. And therefore in time
of penance. we say. Laus tibi. not in joy. but in praysynge of god. and not
Alleluya. which is a word both of praysynge and of joy.

Of the Inuitatory.
BUt for yt suffyseth not to you to praise. and to joy in god alone. but if ye
stir other to the same* therefore after Alleluya or Laus tibi. ye begin the
Inuitatory. that is as much to say. as a calling. or a sturrynge. whereby
each of you sturreth. and exhorts other to the praysyng of god. and of our
lady. And thereby also. ye call them that here you. and desire other that are
absente to come to praise with you. And thereto accords the psalm Venite. that
follows. and is song. with the Inuitatory. But the Inuitatory is some time
song hole. and sometime half* for some come hole to gods service to praise
him. with body and soulle. and all their myghtes. And some come but half. for
though the body be there. the heart is on other things. as our lord says
both by his Prophet. Esaie. xxix.
and in his Gospel. Populus hic labus me honorat, cor autem eorum long est a
me. Math. xv.
This people worshypeth me with their lyppes. But their heart is far from me.
But five times yt is song hole. for they that will be hole in our lords
service must full warely keep their five wits, both the utter wits and
the inner. And thryes yt is song half. for there is three manner of people.
which as the gospel tellyth. Luce. xiiii.
were called to our Lords soper. and came not. for Pride. for worldlynesse.
and for flesshelynesse. But ye that are closed fro the occasyons of soche
lettynges. must come with hole heart. and feruente will. to the praysynges of
the blyssed trynite and of the quyene of heaven. and say. Trinu^ deum. et vnum
pronis mentibus adoremins. Virginique matri gratulantibus animis iugiter
iubilemus. that is. worship we with meke and ready soulles god. that is three and
one. that is to say three in parsones. and one in substance and in god head. And
praise we besyly and intencyfly the vyrgyn mother. with joyful hearts.

VEnite This psalm is written in the Psalter. Psalmo. 94.
and yt conteyneth five verses. In the first verse. we are called. and exhorted
to come to praise god. In ye tow next verses is expressed the cause why we
should praise him. And in the tow last verses. is told ye pareyl of them.
that will not come to love him. and praise him. Then ye begin and say. Venite,
that is. Come ye. To whom speak ye* they that are present / ar come already.
they that are absente* may not here you. whom bydde ye come. and whyther* Our
lord is over all present and ever more ready to here them that pray in church
but all are not come to him. that are come to church. For he says of some that
worship him with their mouths. that their heart is far from him. Therefore to
them ye say. Venite. Come ye. as if ye said. Gather to gyther all the
thoughts. and myghtes of your heart. and set them only upon him. and so
come to him in the reuerente dread. and devotion. and Exultemus domino, Joy we
outward with all the service of our bodies in our Lord. And in none other
thing. Iubilemus deo salutari nostro, Joy we in god our sauyoure. That is
Jesus christ. with all the powers of our soulles inward. that our love. and
devotion be so much in him. that neither we may hyde yt. ne fully show yt.
For so meanyth this word Iubilemus. And that we may the better joy thus in
him. Preocupemus faciem eius in confessione, Occupye we his fa^e before in
confession. There is confession of sins. and confession of praysyng. Our
lord Jesus christ shows now his face of grace and of mercy. but at the day
of dome he shall show his face of ryghtwesnesse. and for we wot not how sone
y^ dome comes by our oune death. therefore come anon. er he show the face of

goodness and manyfolde benefytes and kyndenes to us. Occupy we thus his face
before. er the fend occupy our hearts. with any vanytyes. that should
dystracte us from him. Et in psalmis iubilemus ei, And Ioyefully sing we to
him in psalms. To him sing we. and not to plesaunce of the herers. But why
should we do thus* Quoniam deus magnus dominus, For god is a great Lord in
power and lordeshyp. above all things. Et rex magnus super omnes deos. And a
great king above all gods Angels. and saints. and all good men and women.
specially they that are in dygnite. and astate of power* ar called gods. by
cause that god has parted with them. of his verteues. power, or grace. But
all these ar subject to him. and may not do but by his leave. therefore he is a
great king above all gods And though he be thus great in power. he is
nevertheless large in plenty of benygnite and of mercy. whereby wot we*

a mou^teyne is to the beholdynge of him that stands bynethe* as deep is yt to
the syghte of him that stands above and looks dounewarde. then a mounteyne
is both high and deep. for they that make them self deep and low to god. by
meekness. he beholds by his mercy. and lyfteth them up. and makes them
high mounteynes by his grace. And therefore says the prophet here. that the
highness. and depnesse of mounteynes he beholds. Quoni^am ipsius est mare et
ipse fecit illud, For the sea is his and he made yt. For like as the bitter see
is kept within his bounds by the power of god and may not flow upon the

but by the sufferau^ce of god. which temperyth all things to his servants.

as they may bear to their most profyt. For of them he has great cure. and
therefore yt shewyth. Et aridam fundauerunt manus eius, And the dry earth. his
hands has grounded. For them that are dry from all moisture of sin, and
thryste only the love of god. and reverence of him. he foundeth and
strenghteneth in soche stablenesse of vertew. and grace. that no fersenesse of
the sea of temptacyon. or trybulacyon. may prevail ageynste them. And for he
does all this. if ye would not before* at ye least now Venite adoremus, et
procidamus ante deum, Come ye and worship we. and fall we down before god.
Come. by love and worship him. by synguler reverence that longs only to god.
And fall we down. by mekenes of body and soulle. before god. beholdynge his
reuerente presence. Ploremus. weep we. yeldyng us gylty. not for the thank of
man. but Coram domino. Before our lord. qui fecit nos, That made us. For
there is a great homelynesse and trust of the thing made. to the maker. that
woteth what. and why he made yt. For after our body we are made frail. and
therefore our maker will spare us. and help us. and grant us mercy. After
the soulle. we are made to his likeness. and therefore we may and ought to
desire. to be like to him by grace. And after both the soulle and the body. he
made us to be parteners of his bliss. and thefore we ought to dyspose us
thereto. and seek. and desire to have him for our reward in everlasting
pocessyon. Quia ipse est dominus deus noster, For he is our lord god. And we
may sykerly desire to have that is ours. And we are his. For we are his people.
Nos autem populus eius. And the sheep of his pasture. Et oues pascue eius. For
he fedeth us with pasture of his holy sacraments. and of his holy word. and
of his confortable grace and has ordained us to have himself to our endeles
refeccyon in bliss. if we be his true sheep. fruytefulle in wolle of
verteues. and in milk of pity. and in lambren of good deeds. and in dongue of
mekenes and in flesh of charity. and devotion. But sithe our lord. shows
thus many benefytes to us. we have need to beware that we forfet them not by
our own wylfull unkindness. and thereto we are exhorted in the verse
following. when he says. if ye here his voice this day. hard not your
hearts. or have not in will to hard your hearts contrary to his voice. Hodie
si vocem eius audieritis, nolite obdurare corda vestra. If ye here his voice
this day. do not hard your har^es. The time of the old law that was before
the incarnacyon of our lord Jesus christ. was lykened to the night. And the
time after his holy incarnacion was lykened to the day. Romanos. xi^^
as the apostel saint Paul says. In this are we. and in this grace we here
our lords voice. both in his holy gospel. and in his scripture. and by
inspyracion of his holy gooste. And if ye will not obaye thereto. then we
deserve. that grace should be wtdrawen. by which wythdrawynge. our hearts
wax hard and obstynate ageynste all goodness. And therefore we are warned to
take heed. to the voice of our lords word. and to the slurrynges of the holy
ghost. while the day of his life lasts. And thereto is given us example of
the people of Israel. whom god brought out of Egypt. Exodi. xiiii.
Capitulo. xx. Capitulo. xvi. Capitulo. xvii.
in a dry way thorughe the se. and gave them his law. and fed them with
Manna in deserte. and when water failed them. he made water come out of an
hard stone to give them drink. and many other maruayles he showed them. and
did for them. Numeri. xiiii.
and allwaye they were rebelle ageynste him. and provoked his ire forty year to
gyther. so much that our lord swore that they should never come in the land
of rest that he had behyghte them. And no more they did. For all that came out
of Egypt. dyed in deserte save tweyne that obeyed to the will of god. And by
this ensample we are exhorted of our lord in this psalm to be ware. least
by mysvse of our free will. we fall in blyndenesse. and hardness of heart as
they did. and so be priued from the land of endeles rest. that is the bliss
of heaven. Therefore sithe god has spoken to us. and showed us many mo
meruayles then ever he did them. he says now to us. Nolite obdurare corda
vestra sicut in exacerbatione secundum diem temptationis in deserto. Hard not
your hearts as they did. provoking me to wrath in deserte. upon the day of
temptacyon. Vbi temptaueru^t me patres vestri prob^uerunt et viderun^t opera
mea, where your Fathers tempted me. and preued and saw my warkes. Quadraginta
annis proximus fui generationi huic, Forty year to gyther was I nygh to this
generacyon. By which forty year is understand to us. all the time of our
life. which ought to be in penance. that is to understand by forty. for
our lord fasted forty days. and hallowed that nu^bre to doing of penance.
And all the time yt men live in earth. our lord is nygh to them. and ready to
receive them to mercy if they would amend. Et dixise^ per hu errant cord. But
I said always they err in heart. For though any thing appear well
outward. the heart inward is evermore wandrynge from the dread of god. Ipsi
vero non cognonerunt vias meas, For they knew not my ways. By blyndenesse of
their oune sine Quibus iuraui in ira mea, si introibu^t in requiem meam, To
whom I swore in my wrath, they shall never enter in to my rest God has
sworn. he may not be untrue. if we do as they did. we must have as they had.
and worse. for we have received more to reken for. This psalm me began in
joy. but yt endyth in dread. that if we will not serve him for love of his
benefytes. at the least we should come to his service for dread of his right
wysnes. Dread therefore and be not recheles in his service. but both in dread
of his right wylnes and in love. and joy of his goodness* end ye always in
his praysynge and say. Gloria patri, etc, vtsupra, This verse. In Epistola ad
Damasuin.
Gloria patri, was first made. in one of the general cou^saylles. And
afterward saint Hierome made thereto the second verse yt is. Sicut erat, and
wrote them both to the Pope yt was called Damasius. to be said after psalms
in dyuyne service. And then the same Pope ordained and badde that so yt should
be done.

Of Hymynes and Psalms.
AFter ye have thus called your self and other to the praysynge of god. and
of his glorious mother. our lady. ye sing an hympne in worship. and praysynge
of her and then psalms and antempnes. This word Hympne is a word of gr^w.
and is as much to say. as a praysynge. And this word psalm. is a word of
grew also. and is as much to say also as praysynge. But hympnes betoken that
praysynge that is said of heart with tongue / and psalms betoken that
praysynge that is done of heart in deed. By hympnes therefore is vnderstonded
the life of them that praise god in contemplacyon And by psalms is
vnderstonded the conuersacio^ of them that praise god in deeds of actyue life.
Therefore at mattyns that are said in the night. which is a time most apt to
contemplacyon. the hympne. is said before the Psalms. in token that
contemplatyue people. prefarre the excercyse of contemplacyon before all other
things. And at lauds. that are said more nerer day which is a time of
workynge. the psalms ar said before the hympne. in token that people of
actyue life. ar most occupied in outward deeds and less in gostly excercyse.
And also a Pryme. tyerse. Sexte. and noune. which ar said before meat. when
better dysposycion is to contemplacion. then after meat. the hympnes ar said
before the psalms And at euensonge. and complyn which ar said at after
noune* the psalms ar said before the hympne in token of the same thing. And
for the most part of people of all the world. ar occupied. most with deeds
of actyue life. therefore the service of holy chryche that is common to all.
begins at euenso^ge. where psalms ar said before the hympne. But for ye ar
most set to contemplacyon as your rewle says yt ye should entende to
co^tynewall study. and to devout prayer / and to godly praysynges* therefore
your service begins at martyns where ye hympne is said before the Psalms.
in token that ye ought to prefar co^templacyon before deeds of actyue life.
Nethelesse neither hympnes ar said without psalms. ne psalms without
hympnes. for co^templatyue lyle may not be without actyue life. ne actyue life
without contemplatyue. After hymns. ye say Gloria tibi domine. And after
psalms. Gloria patri. For whether ye be occupied in contemplacyon gostly. or
in other bodily deeds* all ought ye to do to that end. that the blyssed
trinyte be praised and worshyped thereby.

The Hympne.
O Trinitatis gloria This Hympne has but four verses proper. for the too
aste verses ar common to all the hympnes of your service. save three. which
three are of diverse meter. from the the other. And therefore these tow verses may
not be song after the not of thothre. In the tow first verses of this hympne
ye praise our Lady of six great prerogatyues. that she has above all other
creatures. A prerogatyue. is an excellent worthynes. In the third verse. ye
show that for tho prerogatyues. all creatures ought of right. to praise her.
In the forth. and fyfte verse* ye offer your petycyon to her. and ask that
is needful to you. and to all mankind. And in the last verse. ye thank god.
that he would choose her to be his mother. and to be borne of her. This hympne
begins with O. that is taken in diverse places. after diverse
vnderstondynges. but here yt meanyth praysynge and meruelynge. as when a man
seyth. or heryth. a thing that is right meruaylous. he says. O with other
words. As O. what is this. or soche other. So ye beholdynge these six great
excellences in our lady. for ye neither can full think them in heart, ne full
tell them with tongue* therefore with reuerente maru^ylynge and meke praysynge ye
begin, and say O. The first prerogatyf. is the great joy. that the blyssed
trynyte had. and has of her endelesly in himself without beginning. more
then of all other creatures. And the great worship. that god has of his
creatures. by her. and for her more then by any other creature. And this ye
show in few words when ye say to her. O trinuatis gloria, O glory of the
Trynyte. This word glory menyth praysynge / as I said before. when I spoke of
Gloria patri. And yt menyth also joy and gladness. Therefore ye call our lady
the glory of the blyssed trynyte, that is to say the joy and the praysinge for
of her he had most joy in him self. and by her he is most praised of other.
as I have said now before. and yt is showed more plainly in the legende of
this service. The seco^d^ worthynes is yt all the court of heaven is worshyped
by her as yt is worship to an host or to a company. that a king. or a worthy
person be amongst them. And also all angels and saints worship her above all
things. next after god, and therefore ye say to her. Celestis decus curie, The
worship and beawrye of the court of heaven. The third worthynesse is that she
is the spouse of the father of heaven. And the forth that she is. the mother of
the son the second person in trinyte. The fader of heaven choice this
glorious vyrgyn. to be the mother of his only son of jesus christ. He father.
and she mother of one son. And so she is called the fathers spouse. and the
sons o^ others. And therefore ye say unto her. Sponsa registaltiss (...),
Spouse of the king most high. That is the father of hou^^^. ^uique
materia^^^^, And mother of his son. Then chy (...) is thus in english. O
trinitatis glo^^, O glory of the trynite. worship of beawte of the court of
(...) spouse of the king most high. and mother of his son. The fyft^
worthynesse is that god ordained her without beginning to be quyene of heaven.
And the (...) that he ordained her to be lady of all that he manner (...) too is
show in the second verse sayng (...). To deus ab initio. Got ordained without
begin (...) to be (...) of bliss. and made the Lady above all that he made. Vt
de poll. wherefore heuens. erehe. the sea. and all that (...) them. praise the of
dew right as most acceptable treasure in her sovereign lord. I Here take heed. that all creatures ar contained in these three places. that is heuens.
earth. and see. One heaven is where angels and saints are. A another heaven is
called the fy^mamente where are the sterres. and under that son and (...) and
other planettes and elements In earth ar (...) and beasts and fowls. In the sea are fys^hes. and other beasts of theses. And all these are bound to
praise our lady. as ye say in this said verse. After ye have thus praised
our Lady. You make your petycyon to her. trusting that she will here you and
say. Uirgo dum gratissima. Uirgyn most acceps (...). and pleasaunce to god of
all creatures that he made. make us kind and acceptable to him. whom he
boughte with his bloud^. Here ye may se. that ye pray not only (...) And
therefore in praysyng of the holy trinite for that bid. ye say. Gloria tibi
domine, Glory be to the Lord. that was borne of the vy^gyn, wych the father
and the holy gooste with (...). Amen^ vnderstond^ not. that the father and the
holy gooste were bor^^ of the vyrgyn. but only the son with wh^^^heye give
glory and praysynge to the father and to the holy gooste. Amen.

Of Antempnes and Psalms.
OAmabilis virgo, After the Hympne comes Antempnes. and psalms. Antem is as
^^oche to say as a so wnynge before. for yt is begone before the Psalms, yt
is as much to say as a sownynge ageynste. The antempnes of your service. are
taken of the psalms that they serve to, as thus, the first psalm here is
Quare fremuerun^. In this psalm is a verse that begins thus. Ego ^utem
co^stitutus fum rex abeo super syon montem sanctum eius^ And a another verse
thus. Seruite domini in ti more. et exultere es cum tremo^e. And these words
are applied to our lady. and set in the first antempne that is. Oamabilis.
And the same ye may se of al other antempnes. and psalms. for the most part.
Psalms betoken good deeds. as I said before. And antemnes betoken charity.
The antempne is begone before the psalm. and the psalm is tuned after the
antempne* tokenynge yt there may no deed be good. but if yt he begone of
charity. and rewled by charity in the doing. The antempne is also taken of the
psalm* for deeds show where charity is. as saint Gregory says. Omelia. xxx.
Probatio vere dilectionis est exhibitio operis, The doing he says of deed.
is the proof of true love and charity. The antempne is first begone of one.
and afterward ended of all* in token that charity begins first of god that
is one. for he loves us first. as saint John^ says. Pri. Joan. iiii.
and therefore we ought to begin our love in him. and so sprede yt after to
all. And thereto accords. that the sister that begins the antempne alone.
stands turned to ye auiter. and afterward turueth to the quyere / in token
that charity begins in the love of god. and afterward stretches to al
other. The antempne before the psalm is begone but a little. but after yt is
so^ge all hole* tokenynge that charity without deeds is but little. but in good
deeds yt is encresed. and at the end when the reward of good deeds shall be
given in bliss. then shall the Antempne be song all hole. and that of all
together / for then sahll Charity be full and parfyt. whereby all shall joy in
god. and all together each of other. The Psalm is song. one verse on the tone
syde^ a another on the the other* in token that the gifts of the holy ghost.
whereby men do good deeds. are given some to one. and some to an other. But in
syngyng of psalms. ye quyere stands turned. either to other and syngeth face
to face. in token that the gifts of god that each one has received. ought
to be used to the helping. each of other. He to help him with that he can or
may better then he. and he to do again for him the same with that. that god
has parted with him and so each to help other / and to bear other. And then
ar the psalms well song. quyer to quyer. In psalmodye sometime ye stand. For
ye ought to be ready and strong. to do good deeds. And sometime ye sytte. for
ye ought to se that all your deeds be done restfully with pease of other as
far as in you. when your sovereign comes. she does the same. for sometime
she must stand strongly by correccyon of yuel. and mayn tenaunce of right.
And sometime she must sytte easily by favor of verteu. and by pity of feeble
and frail and by pacyence unto all^ Though this be true after the sprytuall
meaning / yet after the letter. the chaungeyng that is in gods service from
one thing to a another. is ordained to let. and drive a way your bulnesse that
ye should not wax tedyous and weary. but gladly. and joyfully. not in vein
joy. but in joy of sprytuall devotion* contynew in gods service Therefore
sometime ye sing. sometime ye read. sometime ye here. now one alone. now ^wayne
to gyther now all. Sometime ye sytte. sometime ye stand. sometime ye enclyne.
sometime ye knele. now toward the au^ter now toward the quyer. now in stalles.
now in the mids. And in all this. ye medel hymns with psalms. and psalms with
antempnes. and antempnes with versycles. and lessons with responces. and responces
with verse. and so fourth of many such other. And all to the praysynge of our
lord Jesus christ. and of his most reverent mother our lady. and so to
excersyce the body to quyckenynge of the soulle* that the^ with all soche bodily
obseruaunces should not be found without cause of gostly understanding as I
said right now before Now join to all this* the fruit of that thing that is
song and read. and thereto* the felyshyp of angels amongst you in time of
gods service. and most of all* the meruaylous andvnspecable presence of god
himself. from whom our lady is not far namely amongst you that are chosen
so specially to sing her daily praysyng* and se whyther yt be not ny a another
heaven* to serve and praise god in the quyer. In this beholdynge lift up your
hearts to that glorious quyene of blysse^ to that pytefull mother of mercy. and
to that most gentyl and worthy vyrgyn. and O amabilis virgo, O amyable and
lovely vyrgyn. O maiden worthy to be loved of god. that art ordained and made
quiene upon his holy mount of Syon* make us to serve thy son in dread. and
to joy to him intremlynge dread. Understo^de by Syon specially if ye will.
this monastery of Syon. where upon our lady is chyef lady and quyene. But
generally and more to her worship. understood by Syon. all holy church. where
upon she is quyene. for she is mother to him that is king and head of all holy
church. O susceptor. O receyuer and glory of mari always vyrgyn. arise ageynste
our adversaries. and thy blyssynge may come upon thy people. Here ye call god
allmyghty our ladies receyuer. for all graces. and virtues that ever she had.
and all good deeds. thoughts. and words that ever she did. or thought. or
said* she offered the^ all up to him. and kept right naught to hyrselfe
thereof. And they were such. as him list to take. and keep in his own
tresourye till at the last. he received up her soulle and body in to his
endelesse bliss, ye call him also her glory. For as god ioyed most of her.
so all her joy. was ever in him. so much. that all thing to were. better to
her. save he a lone. Antempne. Interuenience te, O ^^ther of god. god make us
worthy by mean Dignare me, and Aue maria, and they end with her also. for
afttr each hour ye say Aue maria, and that is for her merciful help should
keep us in to our lord first and last, and on each side.

why ye have three Psalms in the beginning of each story.
IF ye will wit why ye have each day three psalms before your lessons* ye
should understand that there is three manner of deeds that we ought to do. some
long to god. so^me to our self. and some to our even christian. But these three
manner of deeds are often lettyd. and sometime destroyed by three sins. that is
Pride. Couetyse and flesshely sin. in which ar understand all sins. as
saint John^ says. Pri. Joan. ii.
And so by them. the three powers of the soulle. that is mind. reason. and will
are defoyled. Therefore yt is necessary for us to cast out these sins. and
to refourme our soulle. by three parts of penance. that is contrycyon.
confession. and satysfaccion. And after to keep our soulle stable in these
three vertewes. Faith. Hope. and Charity. That the same soulle may come at our
end to the trynyte of bliss. father and son and holy gooste. And there to
be endowed. with three doweryts. that is to know god in full clerenes. to have
him in sewre pocessyon. and to love him in fulness of perfeccyon. and so to
abide with him endelesly in joy. And therefore that this should be the end of
your labor your service that is departed in seven stories. has at the
beginning of each of the seven mattyns thereof. a trinyte of psalms. that is
to say three psalms according in nombre to these seven trynytes that I have
now spoken of. which be these. the first. a trynyte of deeds. the second. a
trinyte of sins. the third. a trinyte of powers. the forth. a trinyte of
penance. the fyfte. a trynyte of virtues. the syxte. a trynite of bliss. and
the.vii. a trynite of dowryes in heaven. And in this ye shall end your stories.
and begin to sing there a new song of praysynge. and of joy that never
shall have end. Amen.

Of the Uersicle.
INclina aurem, After ye have praised god. and his most glorious mother. in
psalms and ante^pnes. ye turn you to reding and herynge of lessons, to
techyng and edyfycacio^ of your soulles. And therefore between both. ye say a
versicle. yt is to say a little torning for ye turn you from psalmody. to
redyng and heryng And when the versycle is in sayng ye turn you to ye altar.
or to ye Eest. both in token that all is intended to the worship of god. and
also to ask forgyuenesse of him. if ye have ought offended him. by any
neglyge^ce in your psalms. and for to ask help yt ye may read. here your
legende to his pleasau^ce This versycle is so^ge of tweyne as the Venite is for
like as the Venite is a calling to psalmody. so in manner is the versycle a
warninge. yt ye should be ready to take heed. and to turn your mind to ye
lesso^s. And therefore all the quier answers according and assentyng to ye
same. And for ye should be the sooner spedde. ye versycle is dyrecte unto our
lady. wherein ye pray her. ye like as our lord vouched safe to meke himself to
her. so she vouche safe to bow her ere to hering of your prayer therefore ye
say thus. Inclina. O quyene of heuens enclyne thyn ere to us. Ad quam, To whom
the lord of lords enclyned himself for us.

Of the Pater noster before the lessons.
THEN ye knele down and say a Pater noster, asking light of wisdom. and of
grace to understand that shall be read. and asking strength to wtstande the
business of your enemy, that is full besy to let you by some occasyo^ from
the fruit of that holy r^d^ng. And therefore after your Pater noster, and Aue
maria^ Which ye say in scylence. for to gather the more restfully your mind
together* ye say ageyn tow petycions of your Pater noster, all a loud. that is
Et ne nos and Sed libera nos askyng to be delyuerde from the malice of the
fend that he over come you not by any te^ptacyon in time of redyng. and
heryng. And this is done. to show the need that ye have to be spedde of tho tow
petycio^s. that causes them here to be asked twyes. first privily. and after
openly. for both she that redeth openly. has need to be kept from vanyte.
and they that here yt in stylnesse. have need to be kept from dullness and
dystraccio^

Of the Absolucyon.
AFter Pater noster follows an Absolucyon. that is as much to say as a
losing fro. or a fredome. for therein ye ask to be saved. and defended. and so
to be lose. and free from all thing that might let you from deuoutherring. or
redyng. of the holy lesso^s yt follow Netheles absolucio^ ye taken here for
soche a fredome as is determined to nothing in certain. but yt may be applied
generally or specially to what a man will that good is. And therefore in this
absolucio^. ye ask to be saved. and defended. but fro what thing yt is not
expressed. And therefore each one of you may apply yt to such thing. as ye feel
ye have most need to be saved and defended from (...) (...) trynite of
persons. and the unite of substance. and how the endelesse word of the
father. that is our lord Jesus christ was not departed by his incarnacion from
the father. and from the holy gooste. And how god knew all things without
beginning before or any thing was made. And how his only charity. and none
other thing sturred him to make creatures. that they should euerlastyngly joy
with him And how our Lady was most excellent in gods syghte endelesly
without beginning above all creatures. And how god saw that all the four
elements should be so dysposed in her holy body. yt she should never do
ageynste the will of god. And how therefore in the endelesse for knowing of
her. the blyssed trynyte ioyed more then of all other creatures. This lesson
begins thus. Joan. Primo^
Verbu^ de quo. The word that John^ the euangelyste makes mind of in his
Gospel* was endelesly with the father and with the holy ghost one. god. Tres
enim, For there are three persons and in them is one parfyt godhed. He
siquidem, And these three persons* were a like even in all things. Erarnanque^
For to them all was one will. one wisdom. one power. one fayrenesse. one
verteu. one charity. one joy. Imposibile vt^que, For yt were impossyble this
word to be god* if yt might be departed from the father and the holy goos^e*
as ensample may b^ had of this word. Ita. that seems to sown truth. and
to conteyne three letters in yt self. Quemadmodu^ enim, For like as if any of
tho three letters were with or a wen from other* they should not then have the
same ^ffecte that they had before. for they should not make the same word* on
the same wise yt is to be understand of three persons in one godhed. For if
any of them were departable from other. as if it were un even to the the other. or
faylynge in any thing. that an other had* then should not godhed seem to be in
them. for yt is vndepartable in ytselfe. Per humanitatis, It is also unlawful
to believe. that the word. that is the son of god. was departed from the
father. and from the holy ghost. by taking of his manhood: Sicut. For right
as a word that we speak. though yt be thought in heart. and spoken out with
the mouth. yet yt may not be touched or seen. but if yt be written or Impressed
in some materyall thing* Right so also had yt been impossible. that this word
that is the son of god. should have been touched or seen. for the salvation
of mankind. but if yt had been vned to man's body. Quemadmodum etiam. And as
a word when yt is seen written in a book. then yt may both be thought in
heart. and also spoken out by mouth Right so yt is in no wise to doubt. but
that the son of god. which might be seen in the body that he took. was
never the less with the father and with the holy ghost in endelesse being.
Sunt igitur. Therefore the three persons. are vereyly vndepartable.
unchangeable. endelesly a like even in all things. one god. In hoc itaque
deo, And in this same god. all things were known endelesly or they were made,
being present all to his syghte, reverently with fayrenesse. to his joy. and
worship* which afterward when yt pleased him. he brought fourth most
wisely in to being by making of naught. Nulla. And god was not constrained to
make any thing. by any manner need. or for defaulte of lack of joy. or for
his own profit. Impossible, For yt was impossyble that he should suffer any
defaulte or lack in himself. Sola igitur. Therefore his only most feruente
charity. drew him to make things of naught. that many should joy with him
euerlastyngly of his vnspecable joy Vnde omnia, wherefore he made afterward in
most fair wise all tho things that were to be made* in the same form, and
in the same manner. as they were present in most fair wise to his syghte
endelesly er they were made. Inter omnia. But amongst all things that were
then unmade* there was one thing before god. that soueraynely and holely
passed all the other. and of that thing god him self ioyed most. In illo
nanque. For the four elements. that is. the fire. the air. the water. and
the earth. though they were not then made* apperyd endelesly to ye syghte of god
in that thing unmade. in this manner wise. that is to say. that the air should
be made so soft and easy in that thing. that yt should never brethe ne blow
ageynste the holy ghost. Terrae quoque. The earth also in that thing unmade.
should be made so good and fruit f^^. that there should grow nothing therein.
but that should be profitable to all needful things. Aqua. The water should
also be so peasyble therein. that from whens ever the storms of wyndes blew
thereupon. there should never any tempest be moved in any wise therein. Ignis
etiam, Also the fire should be so high in that thing. that the flaume and the
heat thereof. should touch to the dwelling place wherein god was him self. O
maria. O mary virgyn most pure. and most fruytefull mother* thou art this
same thing. Sic nanque, For so and such were thou in the syghte of god
endelesly. er thou were made* and afterward of the forsayde pure and clean
elements. thou had the matter of thy blyssed body. Talis itaque. And such
were thou unmade before god before thy making* as thou had deserved to be
afterward. Erideo. And therefore thou were much more excellent endelesly in
the syghte of god to his most joy* above al creatures that were to be made.
Deus enim. For god the father. ioyed of thy fruytefull warkes that thou
should do by his help. and the son. of thy virtuous stablenesse. and the
holy ghost. of thy meke obedyence. Erat tamen, yet the joy of the son and of
the holy ghost. was the joy of the father. And the joy of the father and of
the holy gooste. was the joy o^ the son. And the joy of the father and of
ye son was the joy of the holy ghost. Vnde ^icu^. wherefore like as to them
all was one joy of the* so had they al to the one charity.

Of Tu autem. after the lesson.
TU autem domine mise re^e nostu, when the lesson is thus ended. the reder
dres^yth her heart and voice to god. and says Tu autem, that is. But thou
Lord have mercy on us As if she said. I have offended in my redynge. by some
vanyte of my self. or by irreverence to thy holy word. or by some other
negligence. and the herers in hap also by some dystraccyon of their minds.
from this holy lesson. But thou lord have mercy on us. Then the herers answer
not to her askyng mercy. but for the holy doctrine that they have hard in the
leson and say. Deo gratias, we give thankynges to god The reder asks mercy
rather then does thankynges. for he that techeth or does any thing. though
yt be never so good. and done to never so good entente* yet he ought not anon
to give thankeynges to god as though he had done well. Lu^e xviii.
like as did the proud pharyse as the Gospel tellyth. but he ought to meke
him and ask mercy. dredynge lest he have offended in any thing. and not done
well. as the holy and ryghtfull and pacyente man Job did. For notwythstandynge
that his deeds were holy and good. yet he said Verebar omnia opera mea, Ioh.
ix.
That is. I dread all my works. For he that loves clennesse o^ conscience.
dredeth all way lest any thing should fyle yt. But the herers. thank god.
and say. Deo gratias, For he that is taught or receives any benefyte of god
ought to give thankeynges therefore. Nethelesse the reder asks in^rey for the
herers. as well as for her self. and the herres give thankeynges both for the
reder and for themself* for all good deeds. done in holy church. are common to
all them that are in charity.

Of the Responce,
Sum Trinitati, After lessons follows Responces. that are as much to say as
answers. for the sentence thereof answers accordyngly to the matter of the
lessons. as ye may se in this first responce. For the lesson read before.
speaks of the blessed Trynyte. and of our Lady. and so does this responce.
with the verse. And the same is yt of other responces for the more part. The
Responce with the Uerse betokens good wylles. and good deeds. which ought
to answer to our knowing and cunning. like as the responce answers to the
lesson. That like as we are taught by herynge and redynge* so we set yt a
work in deed in our leuynge. For he that knowyth his lords will and does
yt not* he shall be beten with many wounds. as our lord Jesus christ says
in his gospel. Lu^e. xii.
This first responce is song in faith and in praysynge of the blyssed
Trynyte. and the verse is prayer. therefore ye say. Sum Trinitata, To the
sovereign Trynyte. one simple God. fader and son and holy gooste^ is one
godhedde. even glory. one like endelesse majesty. which makyth all the world
subiet to his laws. verse. Prestet, God that is three and one. to whom thou O
Mary plesydest soueraynely from without beginning* mote grant us grace.
Benedictio Succurre nobis, Help us. and socoure us mother of christ. that
broughtest joy. to all the woeful world.

The second Lesson
TU quoque In this Lesson is told the Joy that our lord had endelesly of
our lady. before she was made. by ensample of the the joy that Noe had of his
ship before the making thereof. after be understood that he should make yt.
And in this lesson ye speak to our lady herself. and therefore think that
our Lady is present before you. and speak and sing. and read to her with as
great mekenes. and reverence. and inward love and devotion. as if ye se her
with your bodily eyne. And say to her. Tu quoque o maria, O marye worthyest of
all creatures so were thou endelesly before God. er then he made the^ as the
ship of Noe. Genesis. vi.
was before the same Noe. after he had knowing of the making thereof. er then
he endyd yt as he was bydden. Nouit enim, For Noe knew. what time yt plesyd god
to let him know yt* what his ship should be. Nouit deus, But God knew before
all times what his ship should be. that is to say. thy glorious body.
Gaudebat Noe, Noe ioyed of his ship er then yt was made* but god himself
Ioyed soueraynely of the. O. vyrgyn. er then he made the. Gaudebat, Noe ioyed.
for his ship should be seth rely fa^^ned to gyther. that yt should not be
dyssolued. or broken ^ sondre with the strokes of any tempestes^ But god Ioyed
that thy body should be made so virtuous and so strong that yt should never be
bowed to any syne. by the hardenesse of any malice. that ever should be in
hell. Le^abatur Noe, Noe ioyed that his Ship should be so pycked with in and
with out ^ that there should no thorrocke that might sire or drop in thereto.

ye shall understand that there is a place in the bottom of a ship. wherein
is gathered all the fylche that comes in to the ship. other by lekynge or by
syinge in to yt. by the bourdes. when the ship is old. or when yt is not well
pycked, or by any other wise. And that place stynketh right foul. and yt is
called in some contre of this land. and thorrocke. Other call yt an ha^ron.
and some ^alle yt the bulcke of the ship. And this is the thorrocke. that
this Lesson spekyth of. For the ship of Noe was showell pycked. that there
gathered n^ soche fylthe there in. as this legende says. Letabatur en eo, But
God ioyed for he knew that thy will should be made so good of his goodness.
that thou should deserve to be anointed within and without. with the
anoyntynge of the holy gooste. that there should never enter be opened in thy
heart to love or couetyse temporal things. that were to be made. in the
world. Ita enim For as hateful to god is worldely couetyse in man* as the
thorroke to Noe in his ship. Letabatur Noe, Noe ioyed of the large bredeth of
his ship. But god ioyed of thy most broad and most mercyful pity. by which
thou should love all most parfytly. and thou should. hate no creature
vnreasonabely. But pryncypally. for that thy most benygne pity. should be made
so broad. that God himself which is so great. that his greatenesse may not
be vnderstonded. should vouche safe to lie. and turn him in thy blessed womb.
Letabatur etiam Also Noe was glad yt his ship should be made light enough.
but god was glad. for thy vyrgynyte should be kept so clear unto thy death.
that no fylthe of sin might derke yt. Letabatur ex hoc, Noe ioyed for he
should have in his ship all the necessaryes of his body. but god ioyed for
that he should take all his body without defaute. of thine only body. Magis
quoque, And more joyful was god of the. O most chaste of virgyns* then was
Noe of his ship. For Noe knew before that he should. go over of his ship
with the same body that he came in with. Pres^ ^bat. But god knew before yt he
should enter without body. in to the ship of thy most honest body. and that
be should go out of ye same ship. with a body, taken of thy most clean body.
and most pure blood. Nouitse, Noe knew well. yt when he should go from his
ship. he should leave it void. and from these fourth. never turn again
thereto. Nouit etiam. But god wyste well before ye beginning of the world. that
when he should be borne of the with his manhood. thou should not be left void
as was Noes shyppe^ but show should abide vyrgyn. and glorious mother most
fulle of all the gifts. of the holy gooste. Et qmuis, And though his body
should be departed fro thy body in his birth and yet he knew well that thou
should nevertheless abide with him vndepartabely wythouten end.

The second Responce.
O Maria v^hiculum. This word is taken generally for charet or ship or
beast or any such other that beryth. or caryeth any thing. from one place to
an other. And therefore our Lady is called here Vehiculum, for she carried and
brought God from heaven unto earth. She carried and bare god and man in one
person. in her womb. and in her blessed arms. She caryeth sinners from
sin to grace. She caryeth and beryth all that will tell upon he over the sea of trybulacyons. and temptacions. She caryeth and bears precious stones.
that is to say ryghtefull men's soulles. from the vale of this wretched
world. so reparell ^he Cite of heavenly Jerusalem. that is to say. the holy
company of angels. whereof a great part was dystroyed and lost by the fall
of fendes. This merciful lady caryeth. and brings the love of god in to the
hearts of her servants. Therefore ye say to her. O maria digniss^^um vehiculum
O Mary most whorthy cha^^^ by which the king of blys. has vouched safe to
vysyte the langurynge pour. that is to say mankind. that was pour from grace
and langurynge in sin. before the coming of christ. Perte. and by the.
precious stones are contyneually borne from our vale. in to the mount of our
lord to the reparacyon of heavenly Jerusalem. verse. Infer. Therefore bring
thou in to our hearts. the very love of him. that by the came unto us.
Benedictio, Deum nobis, She mote make god merciful to us. that was made his
dwelling house. Amen.

The third Lesson.
DIligebat In this Lesson is showed the great love that god had to our lady
endelesly or any thing was made. by example of ye holy patriarch Abraham that
loved his son ysaac or he was borne or begotten. after he was behyghte to
have soche a son. And in this lesson ye speak to our lady herself. as well
as in the the other before. and therefore dress your mind reverently to her and
say. Diligebat The patriarch Abraham loved his son ysaac annon as god had
behyghte him. that a son should be borne unto him. many years or he was
conceived. But with more charity god almighty himself loved the. O. most
sweet vyrgyn Mary er any thing was made* for he knew endelesly before. that
thou should be borne to his most joy. Minime. The patriarch wyste not
before that his charity which he had unto god. should be showed by his son
that was behyghte unto him. Sed sciebat, But god wyste flul well without any
beginning. that his most great charity. which he had to mankind. should
openly by the be showed to all. Prenouit, Abraham knew before that his son
should be conceived with shame and borne of a woman that was carnally coupled
unto him. Presciebat, But god knew before that he should be conceived in the.
O. vyrgyn most chaste. with worship. without man's workynge. and that he
should be borne of the most honestly. thy maiden head always kept hole.
Intellexit. Abraham understood that the body of his son should be departed in
being and in substance from his body. after he had begotten him. Presciebat
vero, But God ye father knew that that blessed body which his most sweet
son was preposed and advised to take of the. O. most bright heavenly mother*
should never be departed fro his majesty. For the son in the father. and the
father in the son. in being. and in substance vndepartable. ar one god.
Intellexit, Abraham understood that the body begotten of his body. should rotte
and turn in to poulder. as well as his own body. Sciebat But god knew that
thy most clean body should no more be turned in to pouldre ne rotte. then his
most holy body. which should be conceived and borne of thy maydenly body.
Edificauit, Abraham builded a dwelling place to his son or he was conceived.
to that entente. yt he should dwell therein when he were borne. Tibi vero, But
ye house that thou should dwell in. O. peerles vyrgyn. was endelesly
ordained before. that is. god almighty himself. O ineffabslem, O that
vnspecable house. that not only closed the outward all about. defending the
from all pareyls. but also yt abode within the. strengthynge the to the
perfeccyon of all vertewes. Triade^^de, Farthermore Abraham purueyed for his
son er he was conceived. three things. that is to say. whete. wine. and
oil. that when he were borne. he should be fed therwyth. Hec enim, And these
three things were dyfferente and diverse each from other in syghte. in being.
and in sauoure. But to the. O. desyrable vyrgyn. was purueyed from without.
beginning to thine everlasting refeccyon, god himself in three parsones. not
dyfferente one from a another after the godly being. Et hic idem, And this same
god. was purueyed to be endelesse noryshynge to pour mankind* by the. O. mary
norishe of the pour. Per illa, And by these three that the patryarke purueyed
for his son. may be vnderstonded three persons. that is to say. father and
son. and holy ghost. Nam sicut, For as the fatness of oil may not burn.
till a weyke. or match be put thereto* right so the most feruente charity of
the father. shone not openly in the world. till his son had taken to him a
manly body. that is vnderstonded by the weyke* of the. O. synguler chosen
spouse of god. Quemadmodum. And as whete may not be made bread. till yt be made
ready with many instruments. right so the son of god. that is the refeccyon
of angels. appeared not under the likeness of bread. to the fowde of man.
tylle his body was made of many members and right shape. in thy blessed womb.
Sicut etiam, And also as wine may not be borne but if vessels be first made
ready* and likewise. the grace of the holy gooste. that is vnderstonded by the
wine ought not to be given to man. to endelesse life. tylle the body of thy
most loved son. that is vnderstonded by the vessel. were made ready. by
passion and by death. Hoc enim, For by this holsom vessel* all swetnesse of
grace is mynystred and given most plenteously to angels and men.

The third Responce.
MAria, In this Responce ye praise our lady of tow things. and tow things ye
ask of her. And in the verse ye ask four things. The first thing of
praysynge is. that ye call her an house so fair arrayed with the flowers of
all vertewes* that the blessed Trinyte would dwell in her and yet he closed
her and all things in him. And to this praysynge. ye put a petycyon. that she
vouchesafe as an house to close in all wretches under her defense. The second
praysynge is. that ye say that she is prudente and a ware spender and dysposer
of goods. And therefore for the second petycyo^. ye pray her to feed them that
are hongry after vertewes and grace. In the verse. first ye pray her to help
the people that is in peril. The second to help them that are in prison. The
third. to comfort them that are in trybulacyon. and lack help. The fourth.
to help and puruey for all. Therefore ye say thus. Maria, Marye. house of the
high trynyte that closes to gyther the and all things in himself. that art
fair arrayed with the flowers of all vertewes. and most ware dyspender* close in
wretches all about wych thy proteccyon. and feed the hungry with thy benygne
prouydence. verse. Respice, Behold merciful. the peryls of people. the
waylynges and sorrows of caytyffes. and prisoners. the trybulacyons of
fatherless and motherlesse. that all mote feel* that thy prouydence has be
profitable to them.

what is vndersto^ded by the three lessons with the Responces and verses
following.
Three things ar needful to the common health of man. The first is. that the
understanding. be lyghtened with knowledge of troth to know what is good and
what is yuel. And for this knowledge is had by redynge and heringe of wholesome
doctrine* therefore yt is vnderstonded by the lessons. The second is. good use
of the frewyl that the will assente to love that. that is known good. And to
hate that. that is known yuell. And for the will answers thus to the
knowing. therefore yt is to understand by the responce. that is as much to
say. as answer. for yt answers in sentence to the lesson as is before said.
The third is. to work that thing that the understanding knows yuel. and
the will hates* be fled in deed and estewed. And ye thing. that the
understanding knows good. and that the will reuled by grace loves* be done
in deed. And this is vndersto^ded. by the verse that is as much to say as a
tornynge. for the knowledge and will. ought thus to be turned in to deed. And
after the verse. a part of the responce is song again. For as a good will
causes good deeds. so good deeds help to stable, and to strength the good
will. The lessons are hard. and the responce are song sitting. for knowing
of truth and right rewlynge of the will. may not be. but in a restfull
soulle. But the verse is song stondynge. for good deeds may not be done
without labor. The responce is song of all. for every man may have a good
will. that is vnderstonded by the responce. But the verse is song but of few.
for all folk may not fulfylle their good wylles in deed. that is understand
by the verse. so much as the holy apostell saint Paul said. Romanos. vii.
that he might not do the good that he would. The lesson is read of one and
herd of all* In token that each congregation ought to live under one
gouernoure. that shall teache them and rewle them after gods law. For each
man namely relygious ought not to do after his own wit or knowing. but
after the obedyence and techynge of holy church and of his sovereign. Also ye
shall understand that all this world is departed in to three times. The first
time was. when men lived after the law of nature. that is to say. when good
men were governed by their own natural reason. lyghtened by grace* without
any law written unto them. And this time endured fro the beginning of the
world unto Moses. The second time was when men lived under the law written
that god gave to Moses And this endured to the coming of christ. The third
time is. from thense unto the day of dome. while christen men live under the
law of grace. that our lord Jesus christ taught in his gospel. and
confermed yt after by sendynge of the holy gooste. And for in all these three
times. the chosen of god had suffys^n^ knowing of good. and yuell. which
knowing is understand by the lessons. and also they applied there will to the
love of god and hate of yuell. which will is vnderstonded by the Responce. and
thereto they did their dewte to set their will a work in deed. that is
vnderstonded by the verse* therefore these three times ar vndersto^ded by the
three lessons at mattyns. with the responce and verse following But after the
last responce. is song Gloria patri, For after the last end of these times.
that shall be after the day of dome. all the chosen of god shall sing glory and
praysynge to the blyssed trynyte without end Amen.

Te deum laudamus Saint Austyn and saint Ambrose made first this Hympne. For
after saint Austyn had lived not only out of christian faith. but also as an
herytyke and an enmy of christian believe. till he was about thyrty year of age.
And then by the prayer of his mother. and by prechynge of saint Ambrose was
converted unto the right faith. when saint Ambrose had baptized him. he gave
thankynges to god and said. Te deum laudamus, And saint Austyn answered Te
dominum cofitemur, And then saint Ambrose. Te eternu^ patrem omnis terra
veneratur, And then saint Austyn the next verse. and so fourth the tone one
verse. and the the other a another unto the end. as the feruente grace of the holy
gooste wroughte in their soulles. and informed their tongues. Nethelesse ye
should take no great head in the singing. or saying thereof who made yt. but
ye ought in this. and in all your other service as saint Austyn says.
dress your mind to god. and say yt as your own speech to him. or to his
blyssed mother. as the service asks. But ye shall understand that this
Hympne devoutly song* is an Hympne of right great devotion. Cesarius. did.
viii. Capi. 90.
For we read that in the contre of saxouy. there was a young and an holy
vyrgyn. in a Monastery of nuns. And yt happened ones in a great feast that
she was at mattyns in the quyer. But for her mystres dred her feblenesse* she
bad her go rest her in the dortour. The maid was sorry and loathe to go thense.
and therefore after she was gone out* she abode a while without the quyer. And
when this hympne. Te deum laudamus, was bego^ne* she se in spiritual vysyon
heaven open. and the systers quyer lift up to heaven. And when they came to this
verse Tibi omnes angeli, She se all the orders of angels knele down. and with
great reverence do worship to god, singing with the quyer. Sanctus, Sanctus,
Sanctus dominus deus sabbath, And when she came to this verse. Te gloriosus,
She se the apostels knele down to god, and singe fourth with the quier. The
same did the prophets. when they came to this verse. Te prophetarum, And the
martyrs also. at this verse. Te (...), And then all confessors. and vyrgyns.
joined (...) the quyers sange fourth with them with great praysynge and joy.
And when the last (...). In te domine spera^^, was in singing* the quy^r came
easily do wi^e again toward the earth. and heaven closed. and that blyssedfull
heavenly company was seen no longer. But much gostly gladness and joy abode in
their soulles. that were that time in the quyer. And by this ye may se how
much our lord god and all his angels and saints are pleased with the
devout saying of this holy hympne. All the matyer of this same Hympne is
praysynge and prayer. And first is praise god by your self. and by all
creatures in earth and say. Te deum. we praise the god. we knowelege the
lord. Te eternu^ patrem And all earth. that is to say all erthely creatures.
worshypeth the. endelesse fade^. Here ye call him god. to whom longs love.
ye call him lord. to whom longs dread. And ye call him father. to whom
longs worship. Therefore if ye love him soueraynely in the holnesse of all
your heart. as god. And dread him reuerentely in the same holenesse of heart.
as lord. And soueraynely worship him on the same wise. as father* then praise
ye him trewly in these tow first verses. But for ye think your praysynge
little* therefore ye rehearse to him in spyrytuall joy. and desire. the
praysynge that he has in heaven of angels and of saints. And first of
angels. when ye say. Tibi omnes angeli^ All angels sing to the. heuens That
is. all spyrytuall creatures that are in heaven. And all powers. That is to say
that order of angels that are called potestates, sing to the^ Tibi cherubyn,
That order of angels that is called Cherubyn. And that order of angels that
is called Seraphyn. sing to the. with voice that never c^ssyth. And what sing
they. Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus deus sabbath. Holy. holy. holy. Lord
god of hosts. Here ye say first thryes. holy. for the trynyte of parsones.
Father. and Son and holy Gooste. And after ye say. Lord god. not Lords. ne
gods. for the unity of substance. and of godhed. ye say also. of hosts.
that is to say of angels. for as an hooste in battle is departed in three.
that is to say. the forward. the mydel ward. and the rerewarde* so are the
nine orders of angels departed in three pryncehoodes. as in three hoostes. And
each pryncehode is departed in three orders. as in three wards. This angels
song is taken of the prophet Isaye. Esaie. vi.
that se in spyrytuall vysyon our lord god sytte on an high sete. and
Cherubyn and Seraphyn singing loud either to other. Sanctus, Sanctus,
Sanctus. Dominus deus sabbath, And therefore according to the angels. ye sing
quyer to quyer. one Sanctus. on the tone side. and a another on the the other side.
and so fourth of other verses. And for by cause that angels praise god in
great reverence. therefore ye enclyne when ye sing their song. Pleni sunt,
Heuens and earth ar full of the glory of thy majesty. Think ever on this
verse. Think inwardely thereon. and let yt never out of your mind. Heuens
and earth are fulle of the glory of thy majesty. A thing that is fulle. has
no place void. Then is there no place in earth ne above earth. ne bynethe yt.
no land. no contre. no place. within us. without us. above us bynethe us. but
all is full of the glory of the majesty of god. O god of pytye. and father of
mercyes. lyghten our dark soulles. that we may se. and contynewally behold
the presence of thy godly mageste. O with what reverence. with what dread. with
what inward devotion. and with what besy keeping of our self in thought. in
word and in deed. ought we to have us in every place. and in every time. and
in every thing. that ever are in presence of this glorious majesty. Heuens and
earth ar full of the glory of thy majesty. After ye have thus song how angels
praise thus god in heaven* ye rehearse how saints praise him. And this is done.
to make you lift up your minds to joy of their joy. and to praise god
with them. and to desire thither where ye shall euerlastyngly praise and joy.
Therefore ye say to our lord god. Te gloriosus. The glorious Company of the
Apostels. praise the. Te prophetarum, The praysable nombre of Prophets. praise
the. Te matirum, The fair host of martyrs. that are washed white and fair in
their own blood. praise the. And not only saints in heaven. but all holy
church in earth prayseth him. And therefore ye say. Te per orbem, Holy Church
knowlegethe the. and prayseth the through out all the world. And who yt is.
that is thus praised* ye tell. that yt is the blyssed Trynyte. Father. and
Son. and holy Gooste. when ye say. Patrem, Father of great and of
unmeasurable majesty. Venerandum, Thy very and worshypfulle and only son.
Sanctum quoque, And the co^forter of the holy ghost when ye have this showed ye
praysynge of the blyssed trynyte* ye turn to the praysynge of our Lord Jesus
christ. and first after his godhed saying unto him. Tu rex, Thou christ art
king of bliss. Tu patris, Thou art the endelesse son of the father. And
then ye praise him after his manhood for four things. One is his
incarnacyon. A another. his passion. the third. his ascensyon. And the fourth
his coming to the dome. And these four are showed in the four next verses
after when ye say. Tu ad liberandum, when thou should take upon the mankind
for the delyuerau^ce of man* thou horydest not the vyrgyns womb. Here ye
enclyne. both in token and in reverence of our lords meke coming down for to
be man. and also in worship of that most clean and holy vyrgyns womb. wherein
almighty god ioyed for to dwell. For yt is read that when a devout woman had
used to enclyne always when she said this verse in worship of that most
reuerente womb* on a time she se our lady stand before her and enclyne
again to her. And thereby ye may se that our lady is pleased with such
reuerente enclynynge. Tu deuicto, Thou overcame the turmence of death* and
opendest the kingdom of heuens to them that believed. Tu ad dexteram, Thou
syttes on gods right hand in the glory of the father. Iudex, we believe that
y^ art the Judge that shall come. After ye have thus praised our lord Jesus
christ. ye pray unto him and say. Te ergo, Therefore we pray the help thy
servants whom thou haste boughte with thy precious blood. All this verse ye
enclyne for tow causes. One for here ye begin first in this hympne to pray.
A another cause is. in worship of that most rich lyquore. that most precious
price of our soulles. the reverent and holy blood of our lord Jesus christ.
Eterna, Make thy servants to be rewarded in endeles bliss. with thy saints
Saluum fac. Lord make thy people safe. and bliss thine heritage This Heritage
is the hethen people. that after the passion of our lord Jesus christ. are
turned to right faith. and now are called christian people. And of them says
the Father of heaven. to his son Jesus. by the prophet thus. Psamo. secu^d^
Postula a me, et dabo tibi gentes hereditatem tuam, That is. Ask of me. and I
shall give the. the hethen people to thine heritage. Therefore ye pray him here
to bliss his heritage. that is to say christian people. Et rege eos. And govern
them. here by grace. And enhau^ce them in to bliss without end. Per singulos,
Each day we bliss the. Et laudamus, And we praise thy name from time to time
unto the end of the world. and after wythouten end. Dignare domine, Lord
vouche safe to keep us. this day with out sin. Miserere nostri. Have mercy on
us. lord. have mercy on us. Fiat misericordia, And thy mercy mote be upon us.
as we have trusted in the. In te domine, In the lord I have trusted. that I be
not confounded without end. Here in this world that has an end. I will be
confounded. and shamed. for so I must needs. by knowledge of my sins Here I
will be reproved and despised. for yt is to my best. Here I will be scorned.
and in alwyse set at naught. as thou were lord thy self. that so I might
come to thine endeles worship. for this life has a short end. and yt is
naught. And therefore lord for I have thus hoped in the. taking and wylfully
sufferynge a little short shame. in this short time of naught. I shall not
be shamed. ne confounded without end.

The Uersicle.
ESto nobis, Lady be to us an help and forsake us not. The answer. Nec
despicias, Ne dispyse us not sovereign lady. This versycle is said between
Matyns and Lawdes. for as I have said before. a verse or a versycle where ever
they be said in your service. they betoken a turnynge from one thing to a
another. and also a warning to take heed. that if the mind were any thing
scatered before. then to gather yt again to gyther to that thing that
follows. and therefore they are always said of one. or of twain. or of few.
that are gods messengers. that give warning to all the other.

Of the Lawdes.
A lauds, Some time mattyns were said by themself in the night. and lauds
by them self at morrow tide. and the same is yet used of some relygyons. and
therefore lauds begin with Deus in adiutorium, as other hours do. By matyns
that are said in the night is vnderstonded the old law. that was all in
fygures of darckenesse. And by lauds that are said in the morrow tide. is
vnderstonded the new law that is in light of grace. Also matins betoken the
heaviness that was in time of our lords passion. And the lauds betoken the joy
of his resurreccyon. which endures unto the end of the world. And therefore
lauds are as much to say as praysynges. for we that be borne in this time of
grace. and also of endelesse joy. ought to praise god therefore. and in
praysyng to thancke him. for all his gifts. both of nature and of grace. and
also of endelesse joy. which is now ready to the soulles of all that will
dispose them thereto and at the end of this time. the bodies of them shall be
arered to endelesse joy also.

Of the psalms at Lauds.
IN these Lauds ye say.viii. psalms. which betoken eyghte orders of gods
chosen in holy church. in this said time of grace. And these eyghte orders
were fygured in tho eyghte soulles that were saved in the ship in time of
Noes floudde when all other perysshed. Genesis. vii.
Prima petri. 3.
For all that are washed in the floude of baptym. and keep them in the ship
of holy church. by steadfast faith. and true obedyence to god. and to the
church shall be safe. And all other shall be peryshed in the floudde. for
their baptym shall not help them. but if they be found in the ship of holy
church at their end. The first order was of the jews that were converted to
the right faith by our lord Jesus christ. as were his apostels and
dyscyples. and other that were turned by them. in whom our lord Jesus christ
reyned first by grace. and began to build his church. And hereof speaks the
first psalm of lauds. that is. Dominus regnauit, The second order was of
hethen that were called to ye faith. and praysynge of god. in all the parties
of the world by the apostels and thereto longs ye second psalm that is
Iubilate domino omnis terra, The third order was of them that were in time of
persecucyon of tyrauntes and of heretykes. when christian people awoke in busy
prayer. and in ware keeping of themself. that they might be ready to suffer
martirdom. and many thrysted that time in great desire to be martyrde for the
love of our lord Jesus christ. And thereto longs the third psalm. that is.
Deus deus meus, ad te de luce vigilo, The forth order is of true christian
people. that are and shall be from thense unto the co^ynge of antycryst And to
this time longs the forth psalm. that is. Deus miseriatur nostri, And take heed that the third psalm and this forth. are ended under one. Gloria patri
For in time of persecucyon. which is vnderstonded by the third psalm as I
said before* christian people lived in caves. and in dens. and durst not. or
might not come together to sing the praysynge of god. But after the
persecucion was ceassyd and holy church had found peace. which is
vnderstonded by the forth psalm* then they might restfully praise god to
gyther. And therefore after both psalms. is song one Gloria patri, The fyfte
order shall be in time of antecriste that was figured by the king of babylone.
For as holy scripture says the king of babylone. Danielis. iii.
when he had gods people in thraldom. he put three of them in a burning
furneyse of fire by cause they would not worship a certain image that he had
set up. But god kept them in the fire unhurt. and there they made and song
this psalm. Benedicite omnia opera domini domino, And like wise in time of
antycryste they that will not worship him. shall suffer the greatest
persecucyon that ever was done to christian people. But god of his special mercy
and grace shall keep his chosen. in that fire of trybulacyon unhurt. so that
they shall abide in faith and praysynge of god. And in token thereof is this
fyfte psalm. Benedicite, song at lauds without Gloria patri For the
greatenes of that persecucyon. shall let the open praysynge of god. that is
used in holy church And yet tho few that shall then abide in true faith and
charity. shall not cease of gods praysyng. And therefore the last verse of
the psalm save one. that is Benedicamus patrem, is of the same sentence. that
Gloria patri. is. but not of the same words. For though the chosen of god in
yt time have not power to warke miracles and to do other open deeds to the
praysynge of god as martyrs and saints have done before* yet they shall not be
less of merit toward god. then any of them were. And therefore ye incline at
that verse. Benedicamus patrem, as ye do at Gloria patri, The syxte and the
seuenthe. and the eyghte orders. shall be of them. that shall abide. and be
converted of all the three parties of the world. after the death of anticrist
which shall then praise god in more peace. then has been in holy church
before that time. And for these chosen shall not be of one people. ne of one
nacyon. ne at diverse times. but at ones of all the three parties of the world.
for all the world is departed in three* therefore they are vnderstonded by these
three last psalms of lauds that are song under one Gloria patri, that is to
say. Laudate dominum de celis, Cantate domino. and Laudate dominum in sanctis
eius. For these three psalms. were made in joy and praysyng to god. for
delyueraunce of gods people out of the thraldom of babylone. And therefore
they are co^uenyently song in thanking and praysynge to god for delyuerau^ce
of his chosen from the persecucyo^ of antycryste. which is vnderstonded by the
king of babylone. as yt is said before.

Of the Antempne at lauds.
BUT all these eyghte psalms ar tuned after one antempne. for all these eyghte
orders though they were. and shall be in diverse times. yet all they are
governed after one faith. and one charity. which is vnderstonded by the
antempne. And the antempne is so^ge all. after the psalms. for after these
orders. the general dome shall be when all chosen shall be brought to
fullness of charity in bliss of soulle and body everlasting. And for the
salvation of all these orders come in by our lady and by her medyacion. yt
shall be brought to parfyt end* therefore the antempne that is the beginning
and the end of the psalms. ye sing in worship of our lady when ye say.
Domum tuam, Everlasting holiness bysymeth lord thy house. that is the vyrgyn
mari in whom you have cladde the in fayrnesse. and gyrthe the in strength.
Here our lady is called gods house. for he dwelled in her womb. as in a
house. and there he cladde him in fayrenesse that is to say in a body of
mankind. which was the fairest body that ever was seen of man. in natural
fayrenesse. and much more after his resurreccyon when yt was vndeadly. He
gyrthe him also with strenghte of soulle by pacyent and mighty sufferaunce of
all trybulacyon. And so he was fair in them that loved him. and strong
ageynste them that pursued him.

The Chapyter.
ECce virgo, Esaie. vii.
A chapyter is as much to say as a little head yt is called little. for
shortness. And yt is called an head. for yt is always taken of holy scripture.
and often of the pystel that is read in the mass the same day. And holy
scripture is chyefe above all other scryptures. as the head is above all other
members of the body. And the chapters ar read at other hours instead of
lessons. in way of doctrine and techynge as lessons ar at mattyns. And therefore
in other hours after the chapyter. folowyth a responce with a verse. which
meneth the same understanding. as does the lessons and responce. and verse at
mattyns. But the chapyter is not begone with Iube domine, ne ended with Tu
autem, by cause yt is always said of the ebdomedary which occupyeth an office
of perfeccyon. to whom yt longs rather to give blyssynge then to ask yt in
that office. And by the same way yt is presumed that she should not lightly
offend in so short a redynge that her should need to ask mercy with Tu
autem, But ye answer all Deo gratias, as ye do after a another lesson. and for
the same cause. as is said before after the first lesson at mattyns. This
chapyter. Ecce virgo. is taken of the prophet ysaie. Esaie. vii.
and they were said of our lady. and of her son Jesus crist many hondereth
years or either of the^ were borne in to ye world. And thus they are to say.
Ecce virgo, Lo. a vyrgyn shall co^ceyue and bear a son. and his name shall be
called. Emanuel, He shall ea^e butter and honey. and he shall know to forsake
yuell. and choose good. Emanuel is as much to say as god with us. that is to
say partener of our nature. and ^o this vyrgyns son is both god and man.
that is Emanuel, god with us. For while he is god in his own nature. and with us
in our nature* so is he god and man in one person. By butter and honey is
vnderstonded all other meats according to man. whereby is showed that he was
very man. and lived after his body. by man's meat. And he shall know to
forsake yuel and choose good. For though he were fed as an infaun^e. yet he
was as wise then as when he came to man's age. They that treat of nature say
that cheyse is yuel. and the less yt has of butter. the worse yt is.
Therefore our child eat butter that is with out cheyse. for he took our
nature without sin. He eat also honey that is sweet. for he delyted him to do
mercy to sinners. and to all that were in disease or in need. the doing of
which mercy was to him swetter then honey. A be gives honey and styngeth. So
our sweet be. Jesus christ. in his first coming gave honey of mercy and of
pity. But they that will not dyspose them to receive this honey here. shall be
stonge with the tongue of sharp rygoure at his second coming when he shall
forsake the yuel to endelesse pain. and choose the good to everlasting bliss.
Therefore yt is said. He shall eat butter and honey. that he can repreue yuell
and choose good.

A another chapyter.
IN omnibus, This chapter is commonly expou^de of doctors of our lord Jesus
crist. But in holy church yt is read of our lady. And so yt may be
understand of both. And thus yt is in english. In omnibus, I have sought
rest in all people. I shall dwell in the heritage of the lord. then the maker
of all things commanded and said to me. and he that has made me. has
rested in my tabernacle. Understonde these words as if our lord Jesus christ
said them thus. In omnibus I have sought rest in all folk. For there is no
nacyon. ne people, no man. ne woman in earth. but that he desires to have
saved. and seeks by sturrynges of grace to dwell in their soulles. Prouerbi.
vi^i.
for his delyces are to rest in man's heart. But for all dyspose them not to
receive him. therefore he abides not but in the heritage of the father that is
holy church. that is to say in them that by true faith and charity. and good
deeds live in obedience of holy church. In all he seeks. but in them only he
abides. Then the maker of all things. that is the father. Commanded and
said unto me. By this commandment is vnderstonded the sendynge. by which
the father sent his son Jesus to become man. which is called a
commandment. as he says in his go^pell thus. Joan. xiiii.
Sicut mandatu^ dedit michi pater sic facio As the ^ather hather give me in
co^mau^demente. so I do. And he that has made me. that is the father that
made the son after his manhood. has rested in my tabernacle. that is in the
manhood of christ. for the father was never the more departed from the son.
ne the son from the father. thouge the son were become man. This same
chapyter is also vnderstonded of our lady. for by mediacyo^ of her prayers she
seeks a resting place to god in all soulles. And the fruit of her prayer
abides in them that are true children of holy church and partener to the
heritage of heaven. The father of heaven also commanded her. and also said unto
her. for she was ever governed after his commandments. and mekely obeyed in
all things to his holy word. and thereby she deserved to be the mother of god.
and so he that made her* rested in ye tabernacle of her sweet womb

The Hympne.
ALme pater this hympne makes mind of the blyssed trynyte in the first and
the second. and the forth verse. In the first verse ye speak of the
incarnacyo^ of our lord jesus christ. and that is for three causes. one to thank
and praise god therefore. A another y^ by that holy incarnacio^. the blyssed
trinyte should be sturred. to here your prayers And the third. that ye should
be the beter dysposed and the more able to receive the graces that ye ask. And
thus understands always when any mencyon is made in your service of any
special benefyte that god has showed to mankind. as is the making of
creatures. or his incarnacyon. or passion. or any such other that is done. for
these three causes. In the other three verses* ye ask of god eyghte great
gifts. The first is to love him. The second is to worship dewly the son
and his mother. The third is. to live chaste. The forth is to live
relygousely. both in christian relygyon. whereto ye bound you in your baptem.
and in this relygyo^. whereto ye ar bound by special professyon. The fyfte
is. that ye be not unready to dye. The syxte is. that ye be not pr^ned of
endelesse life. The seuenthe is. that the holy ghost mote dwell in your
soulles. And the eyghte is that ye feed and noryshe with his grace. These
gifts ye ask for your self. and for all christian people. and say. Alme
pater, Holy father that made thine only begotten son to be borne for us
vretches. of the womb of the chaste vyrgyn. Da nobis, Grant us to love the
always for so great a gift. and to worship the son with the mother. and to
live chaste and relygyously. Ne mors, That death come not unawarely. and find
us gylty of endelesse death. and make us to lose the life of bliss. Patris,
Spyryte of the father and of the son bring in thy self in to our hearts.
and feed us. and defend us by thy grace. whom thou haste purged by baptem.
Maria matter, Gloria tibi, These tow verses are declared before after the hympne
at mattyns. The versycle. In eternu^ The word of the highest fader abides without
end. Quod aulam That dwelled in the hawlle of the vyrgyns womb.

Of the psalm Benedictus.
BEnedictus, ye have i^ your service three gospels, that is. Benedictus, and
Magnificat, and Nunc dimittis, and all three are song standing for reverence
of the gospel. zacarie saint John^ baptystes father made Benedictus, and our
Lady made Magnificat, and the holy man Symeon made Nunc dimittis, These songs
are not song in the same order that they were made, for Magnificat^ was made
first and then Benedictus, and last. Nunc dimittis, But Benedictus, is song
first. for yt makes mind of saint John^ baptyste which was the forgoer of
our lord Jesus christ. as yt is said in the same song. And for saint John^
was lykened to the day star. for as that star goes before the son. so
saint John^ went before our lord in his co^cepcion and in his birth. in his
prechynge. and baptysynge. and in his death* therefore this so^ge is song at
lauds. yt is the service of the morrow tide when that star apperith. And
also for this so^g begins with praysyng and thankeyng of god for the
redemption of mankind. and lauds are said to praise god specially for the
same benefyte. as I said before at ye beginning of lauds* therefore yt is
co^uenyente that yt be song at lauds. The first part of this so^ge speaks
of our lord Jesus crist. And the second part of saint John^ baptyst. The
gospel says yt after the au^gel gabryel had told zachary. Luce. primo.
how Elizabeth his wife should bear him a son* then for he gave not credence
thereto* he abode do^me. and might not speak from thense fourth till after
saint John^ was borne But on the eight day after his birth. when he had written
that his name was John^* anon his tongue was losed. and he was filled with the
holy gooste. and in the spyryte of prophesy. he blessed god and said.
Benedictus dominus deus israel, Ibidem.
Blyssed be the lord god of Israel. for he has vysyted and made the
rede^pcyon of his people Our lord Jesus christ was yet then in his mothers
womb. but zacarye spekyth of time to come. as of time past. for sykernesse of
his prophesy. For yt was syker to be fulfilled. as if yt had been done. Et
erexit coruu, And he has set up an horn of health to us. in the house of
Dauyd his child. An horn growyth in the highest part of a beast. and yt is
harder then the flesh. and softer then the bone. and therwyth the beast
defendyth him ageynste noyous things. So our lord Jesus christ took his body
of the highest and worthyest part of mankind that is our lady. and that
manhod of him is myghtyer above all mankind. and weker then god. and therewith
not only he over came his enemies. but they also ye cleue thereto in faith and
devotion. may thereby sewrely be defendyd from all contrary powers. And
therefore our lord Jesus. is an horn of health to us. in the house of David.
which was gods child. For though he were a great king and a prophet. yet
he was meke and obedyente to god. as a child to his father. Sicut locutus est,
As he has said by the mouth of his holy prophets. that are from the
beginning of the world. Many Prophets. and but one mouth. for as many as
were from the beginning of the world till then* all prophesied also
accordyngely of the coming of christ. as if they had spoken all with one
mouth. Before he spoke of the horn of helye* and now he tellyth what health.
and says. Salutem, Health of our enemies. and out of the power of all that
have hated us. That is to say offendes. under whose power man was brought by
the sin of Adam. but by the passion of our lord Jesus christ he was saved
from that power. And why did god thus* Not for any merytes of man* but Ad
faciendam, For to do mercy with our fathers. and to have mind on his holy
testamente. And what was that testamente Iusiurandum, The oath that he swore to
our father Abraham* to give himself to us. Genesis. xxii.
That was his testamente. that was his oath. to give himself to us. A great
gift and undeserved. But whereto gave he us this gift* Vt sine timore, That we
so delivered out of the power of our enemies. serve him without dread. of our
enemies. For his passion is suffycyent shylde to us. agenste them all. And how
should we serve him* In sanctitate In holiness. of soulle. and of conscience
inward. and in ryghtewsnes. of word. and of deed outward. And that not to
the praysynge of man. but before him. Not one day to begin well. a another day
to leave of. but all our days. while we live. when zachary had thus
prophesyed of our lord Jesus christ. he turned him and spekyth to John^ his
son. and says. Et tu puer, And thou child shalt be called the prophet of
him yt is highest. that is of god. For thou shalt go before the face of the
lord that is christ. to make ready his ways. Here say some doctoures that like
as saint John^ being in his mothers womb felt the voice of our lady when she
gave gretynge to his mother Elyzabeth. and ioyed there with of the presence of
his savior* so now when he was out eyghte days old. he understood the words
of his father. And therefore his father dressyth his words to him in this verse
and in the the other that folowyth. But how should John^ make ready crystes ways*
Ad dandam scienciam, To give knowing of health to his people. that is. to
inform the people. and to make them know that he was crist that came for
health. And what health* In forgyuenesse of their sins. that is the health.
And that by no merytes of man* but Per viscera, By the bowels of mercy of our
god. wherein he has vysyte us spryngynge from high. that is coming fro
heaven. Illuminare, To give light to them that sit in darkness. that were in
the parties of hell. and to them that sytte in the shadow of death. that is
to sinners in this life. and to dress our fete. that is our affeccyons in to
the way of peace. For our lord Jesus crist made peace. between god and man. and
betwixt angel and man. and betwyxte man and man. and he gives man peace in
his own conscience.

The Antempne. Benedictus,
Blyssed be the lord god of Israel father. and son. and holy ghost. our god.
for as he has said by the mouth of Prophets* so he has vysyted us by the
vyrgyn. whom he ordained. from without beginning to be a clean mother. and by
her he hath^ made the redempcyon of his people.

Of Collectes. and Orysons.
DEus qui de beat, Oriso^s ar said in the end of each hour. for the apostels
when ever they were to gyder. they kneled down on their knees. and prayed or
they departed asonder. And she that says the oryson. stondeth turned to the
este. For paradys from whens we are exyled. is in the este. and therefore
thinking what we have lost. and where we are. and whether we desire* we pray
turned toward the este. Oryson is as much to say as prayer. yt is also
called a Collecte. that is as much to say a gatherynge together. for before
this prayer ye dress you to god. and gather you in onhed to pray in the person
of holy church. that ye should be the sooner hard. And at the end of the
last orison. yt do the same when ye say Domine exaudi, Lord here my prayer.
Et clamor, And my cry. that is to say my desire mote come unto the. Oremus,
Pray we. Deus qui, God that would thy son should take a body of the womb
of the blyssed vyrgyn Mary. when the aungel was messenger* grant to us that
mekely pray unto the. that we that believe verily she is the mother of god. be
hope ageynste the by her prayers. Per eu^dem By the same our lord Jesus christ.

wtoute end. Amen ye end all your orysons by our lord Jesus christ and in
his blyssed name^ by cause he said in his gospel. that what ever ye ask the
father in my name. Joan. xv.
he he shall give yt you.

A another Oryson.
DEUS qui salutis ete^ne, God that haste given medes of endeles health to
mankind. by the plenteous virgynyte of blyssed Mary* grant. we beseech that
we mote feel her pray for us. by whom we have deserved to receive the (...) of

unity of the holy ghost without end. Amen.

A another Oryson.
COncede nos Lord god we beseech the grant us thy servants to joy in
perpetual health of soulle and body^ and by the glorious prayer of blyssed
Marye always vyrgyn. to be delivered from this present heaviness. and parfytly
to be filled with endelesse gladness. Per dominum, By thy son our lord Jesus
crist. that lives and reyneth god with the. in unity of the holy ghost
without end. Amen.

Oration.
PRosit nobis, Almighty father. the contynewal mind of mary. mother of god.
and vyrgyn. mote profyt unto us always. but pryncipally amongst these
esternly solempny^yes. of thy son. which mary. wounded in charity stood by
the same thy sonn^ our lord Jesus christ both hangyng on the cross. and now
she stands quyene on the right side by him reynynge in heaven. Qui tecum,

Amen. Antiphona. Gaude Birgitta, Byrgytte joy thou. a song of glory is dew

Oremus. Pray we.
DOmine jesus christ Lord Jesus christ that haste ordained blyssed Byrgytte to
be called thy spouse for inspyracyon of ^^ny pryuytes. and for the synguler
array of vertewes* grant. we beseech. that we be made like to her in
vertewes. in this life. and that we be borne with (...) the world unto the
syght^ of heavenly things. Qui viuis, That lyuest and raynest god. with god the
father in unity of the holy gooste without end. Amen.

Antiphona. Sponsa regis,
O Byrgytte kings spouse^ recher of law. following the ensamples of strength.
thou bo^dest thy lyppe with a red lace. while thou loue^est the son of god
both in spekyng. and in scylence pray the king that he led us his flock
unto the joy of heaven. Here saint Byrgytte is called a techer of law. for the
reuelacyons that she had of god. to the techyng of mankind. She followed the
examples of strength. that is to say of saints that were strong in pacyence
and in penance. By the red lace is vnderstonded the dread of god. for as a
lace. or a string opens and shuts the mouth of a bag or of a purse. so
saint Birgytte opened her lyppes to speak. and closed them to silence. with ye
lase of the dread of god. neither spekeynge ne kepeynge silence. but as the
dread of god taught her. And this lace was read. that is the color of fire.
for she dread not to offend god only for fere of pain. but for burning love
that she had to ye son of god.

BEnedicamus, Bliss we the maidens son. very god and lord with the father
and the holy ghost. Deo dicamus gratias, Say we thankeynges to god. Thus ye
began your mattyns with prayer. and ye end them with thankynges. For like
as at ye begi^nyng of any good deed we ought to know our self
vnsuffycyente. and therefore pray for help* right so at the end if ought be
good. we ought to offer yt up unto him. with thankeynges for his part. and meke
our self for our part. And take heed that ye say not. we bliss god. or we

At Pryme.
O Veneranda, In this hympne ye ask of ye blyssed trynyte. by prayer of our
lady* to have light of grace. whereby ye may se to flee yuell. and t^ do good.
For pryme is as much to say as first. for as mattyns long to the night. and
Lauds to the morrow tide* so Pryme longs to the first hour of the day after
son rysynge. And therefore as the son gives bodily light that ye may se
with your bodily eyne what is white. and what is black and such other. so ye
ask in this hympne to have gostly light of the endeles son that is god. to
se what is yuel. and what is good and thereafter to be governed all the day. O
veneranda, O worshypful trynite. O. one godhed of three persons* lyghten us.
with true light for the vyrgyns pray^r. Quam, whom thou ordeynedest with out
beginning. to be mother of endeles light* that we mote always se to do good
things. and ^o flee yuell things. Maria matter, Gloria tibi domine.

Of the Psalms at Pryme.
THE first psalm that ye have at this pryme. Psalmo. x^iiii^
is Eructauit, that speaks of the spousayle. that is between our lord Jesus
christ. and holy church. And for our Lady is chyefe person of holy church
under criste. and that person in whom abode only the faith of holy church
in time of her sons passyo^. therefore much of the scripture that is expound
by doctors of holy church. is read of our lady. And so is yt here of this
psalm. and in many other places of your service. And on the same wise is yt
of diverse scryptures that are expou^de of her son Jesus christ the endelesse
wisdom of the father. which are read in holy church often times of our
lady. both for they may be expound of her. and also for her sons worship is
hers. The second psalm is. Psalm. C.xviii.
Beati immaculati, which is all one psalm unto Ad dominum cum tribularer, But
for the length thereof. yt is parted in your hours in many parties. for after
each syxtene verse ye say Gloria patri Saint. Ambrose says. that this psalm
is a paradyce. full of fruit. and a shop full of spyces of the holy gooste.
This psalm in hebrew. is so made. that the first eyghte verses. begin with
the first letter of hebrew. and the sco^de eyghte. with the second letter and
so fourth to the end. And therefore as there is.xxii. lrtters in the Abce of
hebrew. so is there.xxii. times eyghte verses in this psalm. By the nombre of
eyghte. is understood the endelesse joy. that all gods chosen shall receive
at the last resurreccyo^ at the day of dome. which shall be as yt were in the
eyghte age of the world. And by the no^bre of.xxii. is understood the.x.
commandments. and the.xii. cou^saylles of the gospel. for ten. and twelfe
make.xxii. And therefore he that syngeth this psalm well. not only in word
but more in living. keeping the ten precepts. and the.xii. counsayles* shall
come to the joy of the last resurrection. This psalm Quicumque vult,
enformeth us first in faith of the godhed. and after in faith of the manhood
of christ. without which faith no man may be saed. For when this faith was
greatly ympugned of heretykes* an holy man that was called Atthanasius. Bishop
of Alysaundre made this psalm in strength of the right faith. agenst the
heretykes. and to comfort and enformacio^ of thme that were in true believe.
And therefore holy church has ordained that yt should be song each day
openly at pryme both in token that faith is the first beginning of health.
and also for people use that time most to come to church. But ye sing yt only
on the sunday. for yt accords most to your service that day. whyce is
much of the blyssed trynyte.

Antempne. O speciose,

saved. By the bypatthe is understand the cou^sayles that long to relygyous.

Of this psalm De profundis with the Oryson following.
DE profundis, ye have in the monastery a beer and a grave to be co^tynually in
your syghte. The beer* in mind of death. and the grave. in mind of the last
dome. when all bodies shall arise out of their graves. And in token thereof the
Abbess castyth out a little earth with tow fyngers. for then the soulle. and
body, that are vnderstonded by the tow fyngers and are sondered here by death.
shall then be knytte again together euerlastyngely. And so^me shall arise to
joy. and so^me to pain. This arysynge was begone in the resurreccyon of
lord Jesus christ. and shall be ended in all other at ye end of the world. And
thereof is made mencyon both in this psalm. De profundis, and in the oryson.
Domine sancte pater. that follows. And therefore each day after tyerce. ye go
to this grave. to bring your death. and your dome to mind. or ye begin to
speak. or to be occupied about any other thing. that ye should nothing say
ne do all the day after. but as ye dare dye anon therwyth. and appear before
our lords dome. And so ye pray the father of heaven that as he kept the holy
body of his son Jesus christ. clean in the grave. and a rered yt up. the
third day* so he vouchesafe to keep your bodies clean in his service. and so
to govern you each day while ye live in this world. that at the last dome
your bodies may arise not amongst the reproved. but amongst his chosen. and
your soulles with the bodies joy with him euerlastyngly. And in the end of this
prayer ye say. In nomine patris et fil^i et spiritus sancti, that is. In the
name of the father. and of the son. and of the holy ghost. And this is said
not only for end of the prayer* but more for beginning of your deeds. that
all your words. and works in the day following. should have their beginning.
and be said and done. in the name and worship of the blyssed trynyte. For
though your co^tyneuall scylence be in manner ended when our ladies mass is
done* yet the place that ye ar in. that is the quyer. causyth yt to be
co^tynued til this time* that ye should begin in gods name. and so warely
keep you all the day after under his dread. as ye be always ready to go to your
grave. And for ye have prayed to him in feruente desire both at mattyns. and
at mass. and in all your service. and asked of him such grace. and mercy. as
ye think you need for your self. and for other. therefore ye ask now that
tho prayers be herd and spedde. and not let by your sins or any others
when ye say. Psalm. C.xxix.
De profundis, Lord I have cried unto y^ from depnesse. lord here my voice.
All this world is as a deep pryso^ from heaven. but sin is an yuel depnesse
namely to them that love to abide therein. for they cry not after help. But
they that in beholdynge of their own sins. throw down themself in to the
depnesse of meekness. and in repentance and sorrowful desire ask mercy. they
cry well to our lord fro depnesses. This psalm is the syxte of the seven
psalms. and the eleuenthe of the fyftene psalms. Six is a nombre of
perfeccyon. for god made all things on syx days. Eleven is a nombre of
trespace. for yt goes from ten. that is the nombre of gods law. and of his
commandments. therefore syx and eleven come together upon this psalm. for
there is none so parfyt in earth. but that he has in him trespace and sin
and needs to cry to god for mercy and help. Fiant aures tue, Thine eres mote
take heed unto the voice of my prayer when ye say Lord here my voice. and
thine eres mote here the voice of my prayer. yt is al one sentence. but yt is
said twyes. to show the gretenesse of need. and the freuoure of your desire.
And for nothing lettyth grace. and the speed of prayer. but sin* therefore ye
allegge him three cawses to stir him to here you. notwythstandynge any sin.
The first cause is the common fraylte. and feblenesse of man. that may not
dereche rygoure of doume. that sin deserves. and thefore ye say. Si
iniquitates, If thou wait streyghtly our sins and wyckednesses. to punysshe
them in rigor of dome* Lord who shall bear yt or suffer yt* As who should
say. there is none a live. that may so escape pain. or get bliss And
therefore thy rigor may not answer to that we deserve. but yt must be
tempered by thy mercy. Quia apud te. For ag^^ste the is mercy. and sacrifyce to
apese the. And this is the second thing that ye allegge for to be herd. and
spedde in your prayers. not by your merytes. but by his mercy. and by means
of the passion of our lord Jesus christ. where he sacryfysed his most holy.
and precious blood. that is contynewally in the syghte of the father of heaven
to apease him agenste mankind. Therefore ye say. For agenste the is mercy and
sacryfyce to apese the. Then ye allegge the third cause and say. Et propter
legem tuam, And for thy law lord I have suffered. and abyden the. As if ye
said. I have kept thy law. and therefore I abide thy reward. For if we keep
and do that he byddeth. we may be sewer to have that he promyseth. what byddeth
he* Forgive. And what promyseth he* And your synnne shall be forgyuen you.
Then if we forgive other* we may sewerly ask forgyuenesse and mercy of our
sins. And if we give help. and do well to other for him* we may sewerly ask
help. and grace. and endeles bliss of him. for he says. Give and it shall
be given unto you. And if we forbere and suffer other* he will spare us. Not for
our deseruynge* but for his beheste. And therefore ye say. Sustinuit, My
sowlle has su^^^red in his word. and my sowlle has hoped in the Lord.
That like as my sowlle suffers pacyently wrongs. and contraryous things in
obedyence of his word. so I hope to be rewarded after the truth of his
word. But how long should ye thus suffer. and abide in hope. A custodia
matutina. From the keeping of the morrow tide unto nyghte^ Israel mote hope in
the lord. The morrow tide kepeynge. is our young age. when we are come to
years of dyscrecio^. that we can know good. and yuel. and keep us from the
yuel and do good. For tylle that time. a chyldes life is. as yt were in night
of unknowing. but then begins the morrow tide kepeynge. The night
following is our death. And in all this time from the morrow tide of young age
unto the night of death. Israel that is to say each good christian man. ought
wylfully to suffer penance. and labor and trybulacio^: in hope to be then
rewarded As a labourer trauayleth all the day in hope to have his hyre at even.
For the day of his life. is ordained to labor. and to suffer. for them that
seek to have the reward of endelesse rest. and joy in the life foloweynge.
Also by this morrow tide keeping* is understand the resurreccyon of our lord
Jesus christ. For he arose in the morrow tide. when the knights kept his
sepulcre. By the night. is vnderstonded the day of doume. when all shall
arise. and his chosen shall be taken to endelesse bliss. in body and soul.
like as he is now gloryfyed in heaven in sowlle. and body. His resurreccyo^ is
paste ours is to come. But as verily as he is arysen. so verily shall we
arise. And therefore glad should every christian soulle be to suffer. and to
labor his body here in penance. and trybulacyon. in hope to bring yt to the
glory of that resurreccyon. for we have sinned. and be not suffycient to make
full amends. ne to deserve to have that joy yet if we have a good will. and
suffer and do that we may. we ought sewrely to hope. Quia apud dn^m. For
ageynste the Lord is mercy. and plentyous redempcyon. So that for all that
lacks in us. that ransom is suffycyente to pay for us. only that we
dress us. to be parteners thereof. Et ipse, For he shall agenby Israel from all
his wyckednesses and from his sins. And therefore ye thank the blyssed
trynyte with Gloria patri.

ET sic insyon, And so I am sewrely se^^e. and stabled in Syon. and I have

have him. Here is named three places. Syon. City. and Jerusalem. By Syon. that
is as moc^e to say as beholdynge. is understand sowles. that are given to

Of Euensonge and of Indulgete.
There are certain hours of dyuyne service that longs to the day. as Pryme.
Tyerce. Sexte and None. And certain other that long to the night. as
Euenso^ge. Co^plyn and Mattyns. And for euensonge is the first hour that
longs to the night. therefore yt is called the song of even. that is the
beginning of the night. and yt has his name in latin of the even sterre
that apperyth at even. Now yt is so that man is so frail and unstable in
himself. that. that thing that plesyth one time. yt dysplesyth him a another
time. and that he will now. he will yt not sone after. And that the reason
desires. the sensualyte again faith. And that the soul would have. the
flesh contraryeth. And sithe one man is thus contraryous. and diverse in
himself. no marvel though many men gathered together be often times diverse
and contrary in felynges. and in co^dycio^s. whereof rises amongst them
sometime troubles. and grudgeynges in heart. or in word. or in chere. or in
deed. But though yt be not in our power to ^s^ape always. but that we sometime
take occasion of other. whereby we are me^ed ageynste them. and sometime we do
things that other take occasyon of. and are meued ageynste us* yet yt is in
our power by grace. not to co^sente wylfully to such sturrynges of ire. and of
vnpacyence. namely and we be besy. and hasty to put remedy there against. that
is. to be ready to forgive any thing that is done ageynste us. and sone to ask
forgyuenes. where we feel that any is hurt by us. And therefore saint Austyne
byddeth in his rewle. Capitulo. vi.
that other we should have no stryues. or else we should sone end them. That
is to mean. that though we be moved by fraylete in heart to any vnpacyence.
we should notte give such stead thereto. for to break out with words of strife.
And if we be so ouersene to break out in to stryffe. then we must haste us.
to make an end thereof by ready forgyfyng. and asking of forgyfnesse for the
longer that such forgyfynge. and asking of forgyfnesse is tarried* the longer
endures in the heart the sturryng of Ire. And the longer that they endure. the
more they encrese. till the sowleys overcome and then grace withdrawyth. and the
fend enteryth And therefore says saint Paul. Ephesi. iiii.
Sol non occidat super iracundiam vestram et nolite locum dare diabolo, That is
to say. Suffer not wrath to abide in you tylle the son going down. and
wylleth not give place to the fend. For he that kepyth wrath in heart* is
occupied with yuell and bitter thoughts. whereby the fend catchyth hold. to
bring him to worse. Capitulo. xiii.
Therefore saint Benet ordained in his rewle that each day in the end of
mattyns at beginning of the day. and in the last end of Euensonge at the
beginning of night* the Pryoure in the name of all. should say a loud the
Pater noster, that all might here yt. so that by the saying of that petycyon.
where he says. Et dimitte nobis, That is. And for give us our trespaces as
we forgive them that trespace to us. all should be sturred. and drawn to
forgive each other. Capitulo.iiii.
For these same causes has our lord ordained in his holy rewle that ye
should every day before the bynnyng of euenso^ge. each of you forgive and ask
forgyuenes of other. saying a loud with heart and tongue. Indulgete nobis,
Forgive us. for god. and for his most merciful mother Mary* if we have
offended you. with word. or deed. sign. or token. For if any trespace be in you
agenste us* with most full will and heart we forgive yt. And before this ye
say an Aue maria^ to our lady that thereby ye should be the more strong to
break down all co^trarious sturrynges. that ye may forgive verily of heart
like as ye say with the mouth. And this ye say before euensonge rather then
before any other of your hours. by cause that euensonge is the beginning of
the night as I said before. And therefore that the son should not go down
upon your wrath. for pareyles that I have rehearsed before* ye forgive and
ask forgyuenes at this time of all occasyons. and trespaces that has happened
in all the day before. that ye may in clean. and pesyble conscience pray-god with
your euensonge. For his holy service ought to be said with clean and
restefull hearts. If any were so overcome with temptacyon of Ire. which god
forfende. that she would not say this Indulgete, by cause she would not
forgive* then she were greatly to blame. and yet she were never ye more excused.
For yt is said in the name of all. and therefore it byndethe all whether they
say yt. or say yt not. and whether they be there. or thense. And therefore
they that are absente. and say their euensonge alone. ought never the less
to say yt. For though there be none present to speak to. yet they speak to
all. and in the name of al And in unity of all the congregacyon. the
forgyuenesse is asked and offered. And this ye may wit by that. that each
person says. we forgive. for an each one spoke only to her own name. she
should say. I forgive. and forgive me. And also if yt were not said in unity
of all* they that stand on the tone side. should not forgive each other. for
they speak all to gyther over to the the other side. and not to themself. as yt
should seem. But for each one says yt in the name of all. and in unity of
all* therefore yt byndeth all to forgive. and pardons all their trespace. And
therefore wretched were that person that for any way wardenes of heart would be
vnreconcyled. and dysceuered from that holy unity at that time. This is that
daily sacryfyce that ye offer every day to God at euensonge time. fygured by
the contyne wall sacrifyce that god bad by moses should be offered daily to
him at even song time. Exodi. xxix.
before the sone going down. And then he said he would dwell amongst them.
and be their lord god. and they should well know that he were their lord god.
Therefore sewre may ye be. that ye shall have of our lord god all that ye
will ask of him to your health. if ye get him to dwell thus amongst you
by daily offering of this sacryfyce. of charity and of unity. But now
perauenture ye might ask whether this asking of forgyuenesse by this.
Indulgete, be suffycient for any trespace or offense that any does agenste a
another without any specyal askeynge. To this I answer that the person agenste
whom the trespace or offense is done* ought not after Indulgete, is said in
the quier. whether she be there or no. to bear wylfully any heuines in heart.
or to make. or to show any heaviness in word. or deed. agenste that person yt
has offended her. as far as the offense lo^geth to her own self or to her
own cause. though ye other ask her never other forgyuenesse before ne after.
But the trespaces yt ar done agenste god. and agenst the relygyo^* ought to be
correct after the rewles of relygyon. when time is. netheles for Indulgete,
But be ware. that none keep wrath. ne make quarrel to other for her own
cause. under color of relygyon or of zele of the obseruaunces thereof. For all
personal causes as far as they hurt not the relygyon. ar to be forgyuen. by
Indulgete, as is before said. And this ye may se by the words. when ye say.
If any trespace be in you ageynste us. with most full will we forgive yt. And
therefore if any forgive not in all the will of her heart when these words ar
said* she makyth a gabbynge. though she say not the words herself. ne here
them said. For they are said in the quyer in the name of all. and bind all as
I said before. But the parsone that has wyttyngly offended a another* ought
to do that is in her to be reconcyled and to ask forgyuenesse of her that she
knows she has offended* before or Indulgete begin. And if the will not
then though the other forgive yt at Indulgete, and ought no more to speak
thereof* yet she must ask forgyuenesse afterward and ye sovereign and serches
that have cure of the relygyon. ought to se that she be sadly correct. not
only for the trespace yt she did agenste her sister. but much more for her
obstynasy and in obedyence agenste the intent of the rewle. that she would not
seek to be reco^cyled. For in that she breketh the unity of the congregacyon.
and might cause our lord to wythdrawe his gracious presence from all. for he
loves to dwell in unity of restful soulles. And also she gives a way to the
enmy to take power over her self. in that. that she dysceuereth herself from
unity of the holy congregacyon as a sheep that wandereth alone from unity of
the flock. is sone taken and devoured of the wolf. And ye same is to be said
of her that will not forgive. namely at that time. of Indulgete, And therefore
each one ought to be full ware yt they keep ne bear no grudgeynge. ne wrate in
heart for though any man can hyde yt for a time from out ward showing: god
knows yt well enough. and wythdrawyth his grace. and the fend catchyth
hold in that soul. Now in happes sum might think. what shall I do. I
would feign forgive. but I can not. Look yt be as ye say without feynynge.
that ye would forgive verily. and of heart: and then ye forgive. though ye
feel never so many contrary sturynges. so ye follow not ye sturynges in word
ne in deed. but are verily dyspleased with them. and loathe them. and compelle
your self to do the contrary of such froward sturynges. then they hurt not
ye soul. for we have our will free. but not our felynges And therefore we
may will and not will what us list. but we may not feel. ne vnfele what us
list. And therefore our merciful lord takyth us not after our felynges but
after our wylles. Netheles though a person felt many bitter sturrynges of
ire and of vnpacyence. if he had a very dysplesau^ce there with. and arose
ageynste them with a mighty. and a feruente will. and prayed our lord. and
his holy mother of help. and so went to church. and said. Aue maria and
Indulgete. with the couente. in hope to get grace. and to overcome himself*
I trow that by prayer of our lady. and for obedyence of the rewle. and by
knyttynge of himself to unity of the congregacyo^* he should feel the
fersenesse of his sturrynges sone abated. Thus therefore reco^cyled to gither ye
begin your euensonge where ye say five psalms to have forgyuenesse of all
that ye have offended god in your five wits. And by merit of our lords
five wounds. which he had in his holy body. both at euensonge time of the
day. when he was losed and taken down from the cross. and at euensonge time
of the world. Fro in the beginning of the last age of the world. he
suffered his holy passion.

Antempne.
Beati metuentes, Blessed ar they that dread the lord. and keep the
commandments. of the vyrgyns son. that sytteth on the fathers right side.
For to them he shall say. Come ye blyssed of my father. receive the kingdom
that is prepared to you from the beginning of the world.

The Chapyter.
Beata es maria, Blyssed art thou marye. that haste borne the lord. maker of
the world. thou haste brought fourth him that made the. and endelesly thou
abyddest vyrgyn.

The Hympne.
LUx deus indeficiens, In this hympne ar five verses answering to the no^bre of
the five psalms. and so are there in your hympnes at euensong of four
stories But in the the other three stories. where ar mo or fewer verses in the
hympnes at euensonge* thoo hympnes ar taken of other service of the church.
and not specially made for your euenso^ges. as the the other four ar. what
hympnes. and psalms and antempnes betoken. I have written before at mattyns. In
the tow first verses of this hympne. ye pray to our lord Jesus christ for
gostly light. that in the wythdrawyng of bodily light by going down of the
maternall son* he lyghten our sowlles with the light of grace And for when
the son is gone. the sterres appear to mynysshe the darkness of the night*
therefore in the third verse ye call our lady a sterre that brought fourth
the son that is our lord Jesus christ. prayng her to drive from you the
darkness of sin In the fourth verse ye pray her to keep your hearts. and
wylles to god* while your bodies ar aslepe. And in the fyfte verse ye pray her
to correct your thoughts. words. and deeds. And therefore yt were well done.
that each night ye proclaimed your self preuyly before her of all defaultes
that ye had done or thought. or said all the day before. that she might
help you to be corrected. and cleansed thereof. And by the matter of all this
hympne. ye may se that the euensonge longs to the beginning of the night as
I said before. Lux deus, God that art light never saylyng. lyghten thou
mercyfully the house of our hearts. while the beam of the son goes a way.
Qui virginem. Thou that shonest above heuens dwelling in the vyrgyn* now
dwelling in heaven. lyghten us that are low bynethe O stella, O star that
broughtest fourth the son. chase away the darkenesses of death. which the
envyous enemy is wont to bring in to wandrynge sowles. Vt sopitis, That
while the bodies are a sleep. the hearts mote cleue unto god. and the will
mote always abide ready to the will of our lord. Correctrix, Be thou correcter
of thoughts. of words. and deeds. that by the help. all mote be pleasynge to
thy ^o^ne. Maria matter, Gloria tibi, v. Pax multa^

Of the Psalm Magnificat.
MAgnificat, This is our ladies song. Luce primo.
and yt is said every day at eueusonge rather then at other hours. for
diverse causes. One for in the euenso^ge time of the world. our lady by her
synguler assente. brought in health to mankind. A another cause is. that we
should daily have in mind the incarnacio^ of our lord Jesus christ. which was
wroughte in the euentyde of the world. for joy of which. this song was
made. The third cause is. for our lady is lykened to the even star. that
begins to appear in the euentyde. The forth cause is. that the minds that
have been labored and weryed in the day with many thoughts and besynesses.
should then be comforted with the song of joy of our lady. and be helped by
her prayers. ageynste temptacyons of the night. Luce primo.
The gospel shows. that after onre Lady had conceived our lord Jesus christ
in the City of nazareth* a none she went to jerusalem to her cosyn Elyzabeth.
the mother of saint John^ Baptyste. And at her coming thither. saint John^
ioyed in his mothers womb. and his mother was filled with the spyryte of
prophesy. and blyssed our lady and said. Blyssed be thou amongst all women.
and blyssed be the fruit of thy womb. Then our lady as she tellyth to saint
Birgytte. Libro. sexto. Capitulo.lix.
was sturred in her heart with vnspecable and unknown gladness. so much that
her soul might skante hold yt self for joy. but her holy tongue brake out
with words in praysynge of god. without study. or thynkeynge before. and
said. Magnificat anima mea dominu^. My soul prayseth the lord. Et exultauit,
And my spyryte has ioyed in god my sauyoure. Here we may learn of our lady
to forsake all vein joy. For after the angel had been with her from heaven.
after she had conceived the son of god and after Elyzabeth had blyssed her
and praised her as most worthy mother of god. in all this she was meued to no
vanyte. ne to no presumpcion in her self. but to more meekness. and to
praysynge and ioyeng in god. And that not faynedly only with tongue. but of all
the inwardenesse of soul. And therefore she says. not my mouth. but my soul
prayseth. and my soul ioyeth And that not in her self but in god. that is
maker of all things. and now is become man. and so sauyoure of mankind. And
that in our lady. and therefore he is specially. and syngulerly hers. and none
others in that wise. For by her. health and salvation is come to man. Therefore
she says. My spyryte that is my sowlle. has ioyed in god my sauyoure. Here
says saint Bid. that his spyryte ioyeth in god his sauyoure* that delyteth
in nothing that is in earth. ne is plesyd with no plente of goods. or of
worshyppes. ne is broken with grudgeynge. or vnpacyence in any trybulacyon. or
disease* but only he delyteth. and ioyeth in mind of his maker. of whom he
hops to have endelesse health. Quia respexit, For he has behold the
meekness of his hand maiden. Here our lady tellyth why she praised. why she
ioyed in god. why god was become so syngulerly hers. for he beheld her
meekness. whereby ye may se. that meekness was the cause. why god chase her to
be his mother. And therefore says saint Jerome. what is more noble and
worthy. then to be the mother of god* what is more bryghte and worshypfulle.
then she. whom the bryghtenesse of the fathers glory chase to himself* what
is more chaste* then she that bare in her body. the body of christ* And yet she
says that god beheld only her meekness. that is the keeper of all vertewes.
And what fell thereof* Ecce enim ec hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes, Lo
for that. from hense ^^che. all generacyons shall call me blyssed. All
generacions of heaven. and and of earth. of christian. and of hethen. of jews.
and of sarazyns. of men. and of women. of pour. and of rich. of men. and
angels. of right wise. and of sinners. of wedded. and of syngle. of
soueraynes. and of subjects. all shall say me blyssed. all shall praise the
blyssednesse that god my sauyoure has wroughte with me. and has given to
them by me. For of every nacyon and people. some are turned to the faith of
christ* that praise. and worship his holy mother. Quia fecit, For he that is
mighty has done great things to me. and his name is holy. what be these
great things. that he made her. that he kept her clean from all sin. That
he hallowed her. and endowed her with gifts of the holy ghost. that he took his
body of her. That she a creature brought furthe her maker. she his servant
bare her lord. that she a vyrgyn. is mother of god. That by her he boughte
mankind. and brought his chosen to endelesse life. These great things did
he that is mighty. to reward. above all that any man may deserve. And for he
is mighty. he has done mighty and great things. And his name is holy. For
he is more good and holy. then may be thought or spoken. And for his holy
name. not for man's merit. He has done great things. to the health of
man. Et misericordia eius. And his mercy is from kynred. in to kynredes. to
them that dread him. This is that mercy that he has wroughte by our lady.
and by his incarnacyo^. and passion to mankind. The mercy of salvation that
David asked after when he said. Ostende nobis domine misericordiam tuam.
Psalmo 84.
Lord show us thy mercy. As if he said. thou haste showed us thy power in
making of all things of naught. Thou haste showed us thy wisdom in
meruaylous gouernynge of all things. Thou haste showed us thy ryghtwysnes in
punysshynge of sin. both in aungel. and in men. And therefore show us now thy
mercy by incarnacyon of thy son. to the salvation of man. This mercy
brings our lady furthe and says. his mercy is from kynred in to kynredes.
From one kynred. in to all kynreddes. from the kynred of jews. in to all
kynreddes of the world. For amongeste the jews this mercy was wroughte. and
after ward spread abroad unto all people. But all take not profit and
salvation by this mercy. for though yt be more suffycyent then all men needs.
yet yt avails not but to them. that dyspose them thereto. And what is that
dysposycyon* The dread of god. For without that dread. none may be saved. Not
the dread of pain. But the dread of god. as our lady says. timentibus eum,
his mercy is to them that dread him. Fecit potenciam in brachio suo He has
done power in his arm. That is to say. in his son. For as the arm comes
of the body. and the hand of both arm. and body* so the son has his
being of the father. and the holy gooste both of the father. and of the son.
In this arm that is his son. he has done power. for by him he made all
things. and by him he saved mankind. and by him he has thrown down the
power of fendes. And therefore says our lady. Dis persit superbos mente
cordis sui, He has dysparsed the proud in the will of thy heart. These
proud are fendes. and jews. and all proud people. For as an hooste that is
dysparsed is not mighty to fight. right so the proud fendes are dysparsed by
the passion of our lord Jesus christ. and not mighty to war agenste man. as
they were before. The proud jews also. that would not meke them to the faith
of Jesus christ. ar dysparsed abroad in the world. so much. that they have
nether land. ne contre. ne Cite. ne town of their own to dwell in. in all
the earth. But sum dwell in one land. sum in a another. And sum in one
City. and sum in a another. under trybute. and thraldom of christen people.
Thus are these fendes. and jews dysparsed by our lord in the will of his
heart. that is to say in the ryghtefulle judgment. of his preuy domes. All
proud people also are dysparsed in the mind of their own hartrs. for as
meke people live in unity and rest. right so proud people. are both
scattered in their own hearts by many vanytyes. and unlawful desires. and
also they are divided agenste other. by trouble and envy and debate. Deposuit
potentes de sede, He has put down the mighty from the seat. and he has
lift up the meke These mighty are they that have great power temporal. or
spyrytuall: and mysse use yt agenste the will of god. and ageynste their even
christen. and ageynste their own sowlles health. And these mighty god throwyth
down from the seat of grace. For by grace. god should have his seat in
their hearts. And from the seat of dygnyte. and of power. which they mysse
use. And from the sete of co^nynge. and of wisdom. for they are blinded in
their own malice. and at last from the sete of dome. where the wylfull power
shall sytte and deem with christ. Math. xix.
them that shall be demed in the end of the world. From that seat shall
such mighty be thrown down. and to that sete shall the meke be lyfted up.
For he has lift up the meke here in grace. and after to bliss everlasting.
These words our lady spoke as prophesy of thing that was to come. and yet
she says as if yt were paste. for syckernesse of the fulfyllynge. For yt was
as sycker to be fulfilled in time then to come. as if yt had been then past.
And for that cause prophets used often such manner of speaking. Esurientes
impleuit bonis, He has filled the hongry with goods* and the rich he has
left void Bodily hongre is an appetyte of meat. so gostely honger is a
desire of grace and of virtues. He that is hongry. has need of meat. so he
that is hongry gostly. thinks that he has naught. that good is. namely not
of himself. ne by his own merytes. And for he feleth himself nedy of all
goods* therefore he seeks. and desires. and labors fast to get them and
such hongry* god fylleth with goods spiritual in grace. and endelesse in
bliss. But the rich ar they that presume of themself. and wene to be better
then they are. and to have more then they have. or tokonne more then they
can. And that they have. or can. or may. they count yt to their own
merytes and worthynesse. as though yt came all of themself These rich god
leuyth void from grace. and from glory. For they that are here wylfully pour
from worldely welthes and comfortes. and honger and desire gods grace. and
heavenly comfortes* their desire shall be fulfilled. But they that have here
richesse of worldely prosperyte and take their joy. and comfort therein. and
seek after none other* they shall be left void. from all goods temporal.
and everlasting Suscepit israel, He has taken israel his child. he has
mind of his mercy. Israel was one of the patriarchs. that was called also
Jacob. of whose lynage our lady came. And therefore our lady says. ye god
has taken israel yt is to say a body of mankind. of ye lynage of Israel.
which israel is called gods child. for he was meke and obedyente to god. as
a child to the father. And in this deed god has mind on his mercy. by
which he promised to the patriarchs and prophets that he would become man.
Genesis. xxii.
And therefore says our lady further. Sicut locutus est. As he has said to
our fathers. that is. to patriarchs. and prophets. from the beginning of the
world. and specially. to Abraham. and to his sede. that is. to the people.
that come of Abraham by bodily generacyon. of whom our lady came. and of her.
our lord Jesus christ. not only to the help of that people. but of all that
trewly follow the faith. and leuynge of Abraham. unto the end of the world.
For they are properly called the sede and the children of Abraham. with whom
they should. be parteners of the fruit of our lords coming endelesly in
joy and bliss Amen.

reuelacyons that she had from heaven to the enformacyon of all mankind. And
therefore she is called a new light given to holy church in this last world.

Of Complyn. and Collacyon.
COmplyn is the Seuenthe and the last hour of dyuyne service. and yt is as
much to say as a fulfyllynge for in the end thereof. the seven hours of
dyuyne service ar fulfilled. And therewyth also is ended. and fulfilled.
speaking. etynge. and drinking. and laboring. and all bodily besynesses. So
that after that time ought to be kept great stylnes. and strayth scylence.
not only from words. but also from all noyses and deeds save only preuy. and
soft prayer. and holy thynkeynge. and bodily sleep. For complyn betokens
the end of man's life. or the end of the world. when the chosen of our
lord shall be delivered from all travail and woe. and be brought to endelesse
quiet. and rest. And therefore each person ought to dyspose him to bed
ward. as if his bed were his grave. For as a man dies or he be borne to his
grave and buried. right so at complyn time ye should be dysposed as if ye were
in dyynge. And keep you so sober. and stylle afterward. as if ye were dead
fro all bodily deeds. and words And in token thereof in the responce at
Complyn. ye pray our lady to commend you in the hands. and keeping of her
son. as a man dyenge. says. In manus tuas, and commends his sowlle to
god. And diverse other things that ye say at Complyn. accords to the same.
And for the same end also. before Complyn. ye have a collacion. where is read
some spyrytuall matter of gostly edyfycacion. to help to gather to gyther the
scaterynges of the mind. from all outewarde things. And therefore all manner of
books ought not to be read at that tyme^ but only tho books that are
inwardely spyrytuall. and easy to understand that all sowlles may be fed
therwyth and helped thereby. to keep themself in inward peace and stablenesse
of mind all the night following. For not only the tongue ought to be kept
in the nyghtes time as dead from speech. and the bodies from deeds* but also
the heart ought fulle besyly to be kept from all vagaunte thoughts. both
tylle ye fall a sleep. and when ye wake any time in the night. and anon as ye
wake to arise. For as the holy father Cassianus, says. Before all things yt
is necessary to us to have a waker and a besy keeping of our self in nyghtes
time. For as the clean. and besy keeping of the heart. and of all the outward
wits on the day makes ready the body. and the sowlle to keep clennes and
chastyte in the night. right so the waker and stable keeping of the heart in
devout and holy thoughts or prayers in the night watch. arrayeth and gives
a great inward strength. and sadness to the sowlle. in all obseruau^ces and
deeds. that are to be done all the day after. Thus ye may se that many holy
obseruaunces. are joined to your dyuyne service to cause you always to take heed. and to have mind upon your health. As at the beginning of each hour
ye say. a Pater noster, and an Aue. to stir up your devotion in his
service. And at the end of each hour ye sing Aue maria, with a collecte
following to keep the devotion that ye have gathered therein. After tyerce or ye
begin to speak. ye go to the grave to arm you in the name of the blessed
trinyte with mind of your death. and of your dome against all temptacyons in
your daily deeds. Before euensonge. ye ask and grant forgyuenesse each to
other with Indulgete, And before complyn ye arraye you with devout herynge of
holy doctrine at your collacion And in yt deuocio^ ye go to your complyn.
which has a verse in the begynnynne other then is said in other hours.
that is Convert nos, God our sauyoure convert us. and turn us to the. Et
auerte, And turn away thy wrath from us. we read that many times folk have
fallen in mystyef on nyghtes time for their sins. And thefore at even in the
beginning of complyn. holy church prays for all her children. that they may
be so converted from sin. that our lord turn from them his wrath. Also
for in other hours of dyuyne service we ought to dread that we have offended
god by so^me negligence. for there is none that does so well. but that and he
think himself he does well and dredyth not defaute in his deed* he may by
that same thought of sykernesse. make himself gylty. For he that seyth no
defaute in himself. he ought to dread l^^te he be blind. which blyndenesse
may be worse to him. then many greatesynnes. that are seen. and sorowed for.
And therefore yeldynge us gylty to god in all that we do on the day* we ask at
even to be converted to amendment. and pray our lord to keep his ire from
us. when we say in the beginning of complyn. Convert nos, The comoun use of
the church is to say four psalms at complyn. but saint Benet settyth in his
rewle but three psalms to be said at complyn. And thereto accords your
service. that has at complyn but three psalms. which are these. Memento
domine, Ecce qm bonu^, Ecce nunc, In the first psalm, that is Memento ye
behyghte that ye will nether go to bed, ne sleep till ye have found in your
self a resting place to our lord god. And how that shall be. the the other tow
psalms teache. for the tone that is. Ecce qm bonum, tellyth of the love and
unity that each one ought to have with other. and the the other that is Ecce nunc,
spekyth of the praysynge and joy. that ought to be had in our lord god. And
in what sowlle ever these tow things are. that is. unity. and peace to all
other. and love. and joy in god* therelyketh our lord to rest. and to
abide. And therefore if ye say well your complyn. ye shall not be without
these tow. And if ye feel these tow in you verily* then bliss you. and go to
bed. and sleep restfully and safely. for our lord himself restyth in you.
and he will keep you while ye sleep. Antempne. Iocundum est, It is merry to them

The Hympne.
Ingenitore, In ye first verse of this hympne. ye knowledge the faith of the
blyssed trinite. And in the second verse ye say that the same blessed trinyte
was both in heaven and in the maidens womb. Not that all three persons were
become man. but where ever the son was. and is. there was. and is the father.
and the holy gooste. In the third verse. ye say that in tho three persons is
one godhed. and only in our lady is maydenhed and motherhed. In the fourth
verse. ye knowledge that her son is god and man. and that none other save he.
has a vyrgyn to his mother In the fyfte verse ye pray god to behold you with
his mercyes. and not forsake you. Then ye begin and say thus. In genitore. The
son is the father. and the father is the son. the holy ghost is in either
of them. and either of them is in the holy ghost. Hii marie, These three per

said. Ecce ancilla, Lo the hand maiden of the lord. Fiat michi, Be yt to me

Of the psalm Nunc dimittis.
Nunc dimttis Saint Luke tellyth in his gospel. Luce. secundo.
that after our lord Jesus christ was borne on crystmasse night. the forty
day after. that is now called Candelmasse day. our lady his mother brought
him in to the temple of Jerusalem to do as the custom of the law asked. Then
was there in jerusalem an old and a holy father whose name was Symeon^ This
man had understand in his life ty time by the prophysyes. that the incarnacion
of our lord Jesus christ was like hastily to be fulfilled. as ye common opynio^
was then amongst the jews. And therefore he desired and prayed so heartily
there after* that he was answered by the holy ghost. that he should not dye till
he had seen with his bodily eyne our lord Jesus christ in his manhod. Therefore
when our lady brought fourth her blyssed son Jesus christ in to the temple
as is before said. this holy man had knowledge thereof by inspyracyon of the
holy gooste. and came and met with our Lady in the temple. and took her
blyssed son Jesus in his arms with great joy of heart. as he that had
found the joy that he had long desired. And in that inward joy and
comfort that he had of that heavenly child* he brake out in words of
praysynge and thankeynge to god and said. Nunc dimittis seruum tuum domine,
Now lord thou leuest thy seruante in peace after thy word. This man was now
glad to dye. for very peace of mankind was come. by whom he should be
brought to endelesse peace. Before that time all went to hell. and wyste not
when to be delyueryd. But for this man was seker of his delyueraunce for he had
his sauyoure in his arms, therefore joyfully he said. Now lord thou let
me thy servant. dye in peace after thy word. as thou behyghtest me. Quia
viderunt, For mine eyne have seen thy sauyoure. That was ye same child that he
bare in his arms which was and is sauyoure of all his true people. Him he se
with his bodily eyne in his manhod. and him he se with his gostely eyne by faith
after his godhed. Quod parasti, whom you haste made ready before the face of all
people. He that is before a man's face may esely be seen. so the faith. and
knowledge of our sauyoure Jesus christ was made open by his apostles. before all
people And therefore at the last doume he shall be seen in his manhod as
mercyfulle sauyoure to all that in faith and in dread and in love behold him
here. before their face. And to all other that turn their back to him here.
by mysbyleue. or deadely sin. and so dye* he shall be seen as most ferefulle
judge. Thus as this holy man says. he is made ready before the face of all
people. not only of jews. but also of hethen. And therfohe says farther.
Lumen ad reuelacionem, thou haste made them light to the lightening of the
hethen people. and glory of thy people of Israel. The hethen were then all in
darkness of mysbyleue and therefore. our lord Jesus christ was to them light.
to bring them out of all darkness. in to the light of faith. and grace.
as the apostel saint Paul said to them afterward Fuistis aliquando tenebre,
Ephesios. v.
nunc autem lux in domino. ye were he says some time darkness. but now ye
are light in our lord. The jews that were in light of right believe. had
great worship of our lord Jesus. in that that he took his manhood amongst
them of their kyn read. And therefore Symeon callyth him the glory. that is the
joy and the worship of the people of Israel. Nethelesse he namyth here the
hethen before the jews. for great multitude of the hethen were and are turned
to christian faith. which are called now christian people. but the multitude of
the jews abode in blyndenesse. But they shall come after. to right faith. in
the end of the world. In this song our lord Jesus christ is called
Sauyoure. light. and glory. He is sauyoure to sinners by mercy. and whom he
saves from sin. he lyghteneth by grace. and therefore he is called light.
and whom he lyghteneth by grace. he rewards by endelesse bliss. and so he
is called the glory of his people. Also for this holy man Symeon desired to
dye. after he had seen our lord Jesus. as is said before in this song. and
for by this complyn. is betokened your death. and by your going to bed.
your beryalles as I said before* therefore this song is said at complyn
rather then at other hours. that ye should every night be ready to desire
death. as he did. O regis pacifici, O vntouwched mother of the king of peace.
set us thy servants. and hand maidens benygnely together in the
helthefulle peace of thy son. Understande by these servants and
handemaydens. not only the systerne and brethren of this order. but all
christian men and women. for your service is ordained to be said in the parsone
of all holy church. as I have said often before

The first Lesson.
SCiens itaque deus, This lesson tellyth how. after god of his only charity had
made the great multitude of angels* so^me fell to dampnacyo^. and so^me bode
in bliss. And how they that abode in bliss. had knowledge that our lady that
was then unmade. should be most nere god above them al And therefore they had
more joy. the^ they had of their own making. Therefore the aungel says thus.
Sciens itaque deus, God knowing all thing suffycyente to himself endelesly
in himself to his own joy was moved of the only feruoure of his charity. to
ma^e so^me thing. that other might be parteners of his vnspecable joy.
Creauit-^gnur, Therefore he made an vnspecable multitude of angels. geuynge them
free choice to do after their power* what they wolde^ That like as he,
constrained by no need. but of the feruoure of his own charity made them to
their own endelesse delight* right so they not compelled. but of their own
free will. should give contynually without ceasynge to their maker. charity
for charity. and reverence. for vnfaylynge comfort. In eodem, But in the same
point. that they were made. so^me of them most wyckedly mysse using the
most acceptable gift of free choice* began malycyously to have envy to their
maker. whom they ought. for his most love. soueraynely to have loved. Vnde
protinus, wherefore they fell anon with their malyse as they deserved* fro
everlasting felycyte. in to endelesse wretchedness. Alii vero, But other
angels abode with their charity. in bliss prepared for them. which loved god
fervently for his love. beholdynge to him all fayrenesse. all power. and all
verteu. Intellexerunt, The angels also understood of the syghte and
contemplacyon of god. that he only was without beginning and without
ending. and that they themself were made of him. and that they had of his
goodness. and of his power. what goodness ever they had Nouerunt, They knew
also in the glorious syghte of him. them self made so wise of his wisdom* yt
they se clearly after the demenyng of gods sufferau^ce, al things that were
to come. Of which they took that in most inward affection* that they knew
before. that god would of his charity and meekness. to his glory. and to
comfort of his host. that is to say of his angels. fulfylle again tho
heavenly mansyons from which the inobedyente angels wretchedly fell. for
their pride. and envy. Intuebantur, They se also in that blessed myroure that
is god their maker. a certain reuerente seat. so nigh to god himself that yt
seemed impossible any other seat to be more nyghe unto him. And they knew well.
that. ye thing was yet unmade. to whom that sete was prepared from without
beginning. Ex intuitu, Also the charity of god without doubt enfla^med them
all in a point. momente or instante, of the beholdynge of the clerenesse of
god so that each of them loved other as himself. Nethelesse they loved god
most. and above all things. And they loved that thing unmade that shu^de be
set in the seat next unto god* more then themself For they se that god
loved souereynly that thing unmade. and had most joy thereof. Omnium
consolatio, O vyrgyn mary comfort of all. thou art this same thing. to whom
angels from the beginning of their making. burnt in so great charity* that
though they ioyed more then may be spoken. of the swetnesse. and clerenesse
that they had to be so nyghe the syghte of god* yet they ioyed much more. for
that thou should be more nerer to god then they. and for they knew that there
was reserved to the. more charity. and more swetnesse then they had Videbant,
They se also upon the same seat. a certain crown of so great fayrenesse.
and of so great worthynesse* that the majesty of none. safe of god alone.
should over pass yt. Vnde qmuis, wherefore though they knew. that god should
verily have great worship. and joy for he had made them* yet they se that
more worship and more joy should come to god of that. that thou should be
made to so high a crown Et ideo ipsi. And therefore the same angels. ioyed
more for that god would make the* then for that god had made them. Et sic tu,
And so thou O. vyrgyn most holy. that were sovereign delight to god himself
without beginning. were joy to angels anon as they were made. Et sic vere,
And so verily. god with angels. and angels with god ioyed most inwardely of
the. ere thou were made. O virgyn most worthy of all creatures. Tu autem,
Responce. Te sanctum, All angels in heaven praise the. holy lord. sayng lord.
praysynge and worship belongs to the. Uerse. Cherubyn, Cherubyn and Seraphyn.
and all the orders of heaven. erye praysynges to ye lord. for thy glory O.
vyrgyn. saying Te decet. Lord praysynge and worship belongs to the.
Benedictio. In matrem, The vyrgyn chosen to be yt mother of god. mote show us
which is the right way unto heaven.

The second Lesson.
INtendens Igitur deus, In this Lesson the aungel shows that god has more
worship. and angels more joy and man more profit of our lady. then al
creatures that ever were made in earth. He shows also how the holy virtues
and works of our lady. are lykened by diverse creatures. that god made in the
beginning of the world. And thus he begins. Intendens igitur Therefore god
preposynge to make the world with other creatures that are therein* he said
Fiat, Be yt made. Genes. primo.
Et statim, And anon that was parfytly made. that he intended to make. Mundo
itaque, And when the world. and all creatures, save only man were parfytly
made. and were reuerentely present with fairness to the syghte of god. there
was yet a less world unmade p^sente before god with all fayrenesse. where of
should come more glory to god. and more myrthe to angels. and more profit to
echeman that would use the goodness of yt. then of this more world. O
predulcis, O most sweet lady vyrgyn mary. amyable and lovely to all. and
profitable to all* full conuenyently thou art understand by this less
world. Ex scriptura, Genes. primo.
Men also knows of scripture. that yt plesed god to depart light from
darkness in this more world. But for sothe that departing of light and
darkness that should be made in the after thy making. plesed him much more.
That is to say. when the ignorance of thy tender chyldehode. which is lykened
to darckenesse. should in all wise depart from the. and the knowing of god.
which is lykened to light. with will and understanding to live after his
will, should abide most fully in the with most feruente charity. Co^uenienter
itaque, And co^uenyently. is all tenderness of young chyldehod lykened to
darckenesse in which young chyldehode god is not known. ne there is had
reason ne dyscrescio^ to wit what is to be done. Hanc vtique, But thou. o.
vyrgyn clean fro all sin haste ouerpassed this tenderness of young age. Genes.
primo.
most innocently. Deinde, Furthermore. as god made tow lyghtes. with stars
also. necessary to this world. one for the day. a another for the night* so he
se before, that tow lyghtes should be made in the. much more bryghte. Primum,
For thy first light was thy godly obedyence. which shone most clearly as ye
son in heaven before angels. and in the world before good men. to whom god
is verily everlasting day. Secundum, And the second light was thy most
stable faith by which as by light of the moon. many that in nyghtes time.
that is. from that hour in which the maker of all things should suffer
death in his manhod for his creature. unto his resurreccyon* wandrynge
wretchedly in darkness of dyspayre. and of mysbyleue* should be brought
again to knowledge of truth. Stellis, The thoughts also of thy heart apered
like unto stars. in that^ that from that time that thou had first
knowing of god thou abodest so feruente in the charity of god unto thy death*
that all thy thoughts appeared more brighte to the syghte of god. and of
angels. then stars do in the syghte of men. Volucrum, Also the high
flyghtes. and the sweet sownynge songs of birds of diverse kinds* bytokened
all the words of thy lyppes which should stye up with all swetnesse from
thine erthely body unto the eres of him ye settyth in trone of mageste to
souerayn joy of angels. Preterea^ Furthermore thou were like to all the earth.
in that. that is all things that have erthely body in this more world. should
be noryshed of ye fruytes of the earth right so all the same thing. should
not only take noryshynge of thy fruit. but also the self life. Florigeris,
Thy works also might worthyly be lykened to florysshynge and fruytefull
trees. for thou should do them with so great charity. that they should
delight god. and his angels. more then the fayrenesse of al flowers. and the
swetnesse of al fruytes. Prefertim^ Namely while yt is to be byloued without
all doubt that god se in the. before thy making. mo virtues then in all kinds
of herbs. of flowers. of trees. of fruytes. of stones. or of metalles. that
might be found in bread of all the world. Vnde, wherefore no marvel though
god had more delight in the. thou less world. that were yet to be made* then
of this more world. Nam licet, For though the world were made before the.
yet yt was to perysshe with all things that were therein. But thou in thine
vnfaylynge fayrenesse. after the endelesse fore ordenaunce of god should
abide vndepartably in his most loved love In nullo, For that more world
deserved in nothing ne might deserve. that it should be made everlasting. Sed
tu, But thou O. blyssed mary. most fulle of virtues. haste after thy making.
most worthyly deserved. by the helping grace of god. with the perfeccyon of
all virtues* all things that god has vouchedsafe to do with the. Tu aufem,
Respo^ce. Benedicta, Blessed be the earth whose flowers. fade not. whose fruit
is life. of all that live. geuyng noryshynge to all mankind. Uerse. Vere, For
southe this earth is the vyrgyn mother. the flowers are her works. her son
is the fruit. Thus the verse expouneth the responce. and both accords to
the lesson. as ye may se. Benediccio, Corona, The quiene arrayed with the
croune of virtues* be ready to us contynewally in defense. Amen.

The third Lesson,
VIrtutum omnium. In this Lesson is told the cause why god gave to man. and to
au^gel fre choice whyther they would do good or yuel And how god is worshyped
specially with three crowns. The first crown is the vertew by which he made
angels. The second crown is the verteu by which he made man. The third
crown is the verteu by which he made our lady to the reparynge both of man
and of angels. The lesson begins thus Virtutum omnium, God is the worker of
all virtues and the self vertew. so that yt is vnposyble to all creatures that
are made* to shine with any verteu without his help. Qui a principio, which
from the beginning after he had made the world and all creatures* at the
last by his verteu he made man. geuynge him fre choice. that by him he should
stand parseuerantly in good. to good reward. and not fall into yuell. to
yuell reward. Nam sicut, For as agenste men, their works are acounted for
little that will not work till they are compelled to work by stocks. or by
fetters. and their works ar worthy love and right good reward. that not
constrained. but of free will do that they have to do of pure charity* and
like wise if god had not given free choice to angels. and to men. they should
seem in manner to be compelled to do tho things that they should do and their
works to be worthy little reward. Placuit igit Therefore yt plesed that verteu
that is god himself. to give them fredome to do what they would. and he made
them fully to understood. what reward godly obedyence should deserve. and
what pains proud vnobedie^ce should make his folowers worthy. Magnam And
great verteu god showed when he made man of earth. to ye end. that by charity
and mekenes. he should deserve to be made a dweller of the mansyon of heaven.
from which angels contrary to gods will. were wretchedly cast out for
pride and envy. Erant enim, For virtues were hateful to them. for which they
might hyly have be crowned. Nam nulli, For be yt doubt to none. that as a
king is honored and worshyped of his kyngly crown. so each verteu not only
worshypeth his doer amongst men. but also yt arayeth him excellently. as with
ashynyng crown before god and angels. And therefore each vereteu may
co^uenyently be called a shynyng crown. Vnde. wherefore the no^bre of crounes
is to be believed vnthyncable. with which god him self shyneth most hyly. whose
virtues ouerpasse without lykensse. in multitude. and in gretnes. and in
worthynesse. all things yt were. that are. and shall be. For he wroughte never
other thing but virtues. whom yet specially three vtues arrayed more
gloryously. as three most bryghte crowns. Virtus nanque, For that virtue by
which he made angels. was his first crown. from which so^me of the^ having
envy to the glory of god. wretchedly depryued themself. Illa quoque. And that
verteu by which he made man. was to him the second crown. from which the
self man was also suddenly priued of his own folly. consenting to the enuyful
sturrer and suggestoure. Veru^ptamen, Nethelesse the verteu of god or the glory
of his verteu might not be made less. by the fall of tho angels. or of man.
though they them self made vngloryous for thyr wyckednes. fell from glory.
for they would not give glory to god. for that. that he had made them to his.
and to their own glory. but the most wise wisdom of god. changed their
wickedness in to the glory of his verteu. Virtus vero, And that verteu by
which he made the o, desyderable vyrgyn to his endeles glory* gloryfyed him as
the third crown. by which angels knew that the brekynges of the first
crowns. should be made hole again. Vnde o, domina, wherefore o Lady. hope of
our health. thou may ryghtefully be called the crownde of gods worship.
For as by the. he wroughte most sovereign verteu* right so most sovereign
worship came to him by the. before all the creatures. Clare vtique, And clearly
was yt known to angels. when thou were unmade. present to gods syghte.
that thou should by thy most holy meekness overcome the fend. which. by
his pride had dampened himself. and of his malice begyled man. Igitur qmuis,
Therefore though angels se man fall to great wretchedness yet they might not
sorrow for joy of the syghte of god. namely for yt was open inoughe to them.
what things. and how great things god should vouchesafe to do with thy
meekness. after thy making, Responce. Christi virgo, Most loved vyrgyn of

The fyfte is. yt she dwelte in god endelesly. The syxte is. that all the

For ye pray in the person. and in the obedyence of holy church. and so for
the profit of holy church in all your service. as I have said often before
hand. And all your prayer is so much the better. Virgo fulgens, Uyrgyn

The Hympne.
DEus plasmator. In this hympne ye praise god of syx things. and three things
ye ask of him. First ye praise him as god and man. The second. ye praise him
of the largeness of his charity. by which he made man and gave him free
choice to do what he would. The third. ye praise him of his ryghtwesnesse. in
that he punysshed ryghtfully both man and aungel. that mysvsed this fredom.
The forth. ye praise him. both of right wesnes. and of mercy in that. that he
forsakes them ryghtfully. that are harded in sin. and mercyfully receives
them that do penance. And also in that. that he releueth them that meke
themself. and bears down them that enhau^ce themself. The.v. ye praise him
as large in his behestes to the^ that obaye to his bydynges. And the.vi. ye
praise him as true in fulfyllyng promesses. both in geuyng of pain to ye
wicked. and of bliss to ye good. And therefore ye ask of him iii. things.
One. that ye be ready to keep ye he byddeth. A another yt ye be rewarded with his
chosen. And ye third that though ye deserve not to be hard for your self.
yet yt he will grant you your askynges. by prayers of his holy mother. the^
ye say thus. Deus plasmator God maker of man. son of the untouched vyrgyn.
that gave us fredome. whom thou made. Qui angelis, Ryghteful judge. that

list to dwell in you and feed you with his comfort. First ye shall
understand. that the north wind is cold and bytyng. and makes fair
flowers some time to fade. And therefore by the north is vnderstonded the fen^^
lucyfer. that by coldenesse of his malyse caused other angels that are lykened
to fayreflowree. to fall from bliss. The holy ghost also is understand by
the sowthe. for like as the sowthe wind that is in manner hot. causes often

ERo testatur, This lesson shows how Adam after he had sinned. sorowed^ for
the essense of god that he was fallen in. by Eue^ and how he ioyed. for the
health that he should (...) to. ^ene^..iii.
by mary. Protestatur, Holy scripture beryth witness. that Adam being in the
felycyte of paradyse. brake the commandment of god. but yt makyth no mind.
that he was vnobedyente to the will of god after he was come in to
wretchedness. Vnde vere, whereof yt is verily showed. that Adam loved god with
all the myghtes of his heart. in that. that after his son had slain his
brother^ he fled the flesshely felyshyp of his wife. And afterward herynge
ye bidding of god* he coupeled himself again obedyently to the same wife. as
matrymony askyth. Grauius quoque. And more grievously he re^^nted him that he
had offended his maker* then that he had ca^^ him self to be tormented in
most grievous paynts, Idcirco, Therefore yt is known. not to be vnrightful that
as yt ire of god came upon him for pride. by which he had offended god in his
felycyte* right so great comfort should be given unto him being in
wretchedness. by cause yt he wayled^ and sorowed in very ^^kenes. and in most
grievous penance. yt he had provoked to wrath so benygne a make. Maiorem
autem, And more comfort might Adam not parceyue* then to be certifyed. that
god should vouchesafe to be borne of his generacyon. to bye again tho sowlles
by meekness and charity. which the same Adam. depryued thorugh envy of ye
fend. had thrown down by his pride from endelesse life. Sed quia. But for yt
seems impossible to all wise men. and as yt is. that god. whom besemeth no
birth, but most honest. should take to him a body of mankind by flesshely
lust as other children* much more Adam. that was made without flesshely
delight. byleued yt impossible. Ergo intellexit, Therefore Adam understood that
it plesed not the maker of all things. to make a man's body to himself in
that wise. as he had made his body, or Eues body. Credebat idcirco, Adam
therefore byleued. that god would take man's body of a person like in body to
Eve. which should floryshe by parfeccyo^. of all virtues above all begotten of
man. and of woman. and be borne of her most honestly with godhed. and manhed.
her maydenhed safe^ Vnde sine omni, wherefore yt is known to be byleued without
any dowte. that this Adam. when he felt that god was in manner plesed to him
ward. had great sorrow of the words which Eve learned of speaking with the
fend* an like wise when he came in to sorrow, and wretchedness, he had great
joy and comfort of the words. which thou. O mary. hope of all. should
answer to the au^gel. Dolebat quoque. Adam sorowed also. yt the body of Eve.
made of his body. had drawn him deceyuably to endelesse death of hell* but he
ioyed for he knew yt worshypfull body to be borne of thy body. O most honest
of vyrgyns* which should myghtely bring again him. and his progeny to heavenly
life. Tristabatur etiam, Adam was also heavy. that Eve his fellow. had begone
of right great pride. to be vnobedyente to her maker. But he ioyed. for he se
before. that y^. O mary. his most dear daughter. should obaye to god in all
things. with sovereign meekness. Dolebat Adam, Adam sorowed. for Eve of pride
had said in her heart. as if she would be made even to god. wherefore she fell
to great hurt in the syghte of god. and of angels. But he ioyed that thy
word by which thou should mekely, profess the. the hand maiden of god.
shone bryghte in her fore knowing to thy great glory. Tristabatur etiam, Adam
was heavy also. for the word of Eve had provoked god to wrath. to dampnacyon
of herself. and of all other that came a^^ her. But he ioyed for thy word
should draw the charity of god to great comfort. to the. and to all dampened by
the word of Eve. Verbum enim, For the word of Eve cast out herself with
man. in great sorrow from glory. and shut the gates of heaven to them and to
her children. Tu autem. But thy blyssed word. O. mother of wisdom. brought
the to great joy. and opened the gates of heaven to all that will enter, Vnde
sicut,. wherefore as angels in heaven ioyed. for that they se. before the
making of the world that thou. O mother of god should be borne* right so
Adam of forknowynge of thy birth. had great joy and gladness. Responce. Eua
matter, The mother Eve conseurynge to the enmy. put out herself with man from
glory. changeynge life into death. whose blyssed daughter obeynge to god
overcame the enmy. restored glory. chased away death and brought again life.

The second Lesson.
EIectus denique Adam This Lesson tellyth of the governance of mankind fro
Adam unto Abraham. and how Abraham. Isaac. and Jacob. and other patriarchs had
knowledge. and (...) of the coming of our lady. long or she was borne.
E^ectus denique. Adam cast out of paradyse. had experyence in himself. of the
ryghtwesnesse^ and mercy of god, dredynge god for ryghtwesnesse. and most
inwardely loueynge him for mercy. all the times of his life. Bone vtique. And
well was the world disposed. as long as they. that came after him did on the
same wife. Cessantibus, But when men ceased to behold the rytwesnesse. and the
mercy of god* many of the^ forgatte their maker Nam credebant, for they byleued

moved of his most merciful fatherly (...). Genes. xii.
vysyted Abraham the trrew follower of his faith. and made couenaunte with him
and with his progeny and fulfilled Abraham's desire. Ca. 15.17. and 22
geuynge him a son called Isaac. of whose progeny he behyghte. his son criste
to be borne. Vnde been. wherefore yt is ^^^^wen well credible. that is was showed
also of god to abraham. that one of s^e daughters of his ly^ag^. ^ clean
vyrgyn. should bring furthe the son of god. Creditur quoque, yt is also
byleued that Abraham ioyed more of that daughter to come then of Isaac his
son. and loved her with more charity. then his son ysaac Intelligendum est,
yt is to be understood that Abraham ye friend of god. purchased not temporal
goods for pride. or for couetyse. ne that he desired a son for hy^ own
bodily comfort and for he was as a good gardener that faithfully serving his
lord. plaunted a little branch of a vine in his or^herde. understanding y^
thereof innumerable vynce might be planted, and that a chosen vynyerde should
be made thereof And therefore he gathered douge. that the vynes made fat
thereof. should not fade. but be made plenteous to bring furthe fruit.
Letabat^r quippe, That gardener was glad. for he knew that there should be a
certain tree amongst his little plants so high and so delectable that yt
should soueraynly delight his lord to walk in the vyneyerde for fayrenesse of
the tr^ and that the same lord should taste the sw^^tnesse of y^ (...) And
rest him (...) sitting under the shadow thereof. Per hunc^ By this gardener.
is vn^^^sto^ded Abraham. and the little branch of the vine* Isaac his son.
And by the many vynes to be planted thereof* all his progeny. And by the dongue
ar^ vnderstonded. worldely ry^hesse. which Abraham godd^^ loved. desired not.
but to the sustenaunce of gods people. Perillam. By that fair tree. is be
tokened the vyrgyn mary. And by the lord almighty god. that purposed not to
come in to the vyneyerde that ye in to the progeny of Abraham. tylle that hye
tree were there. that is, tylle the gloriouse vyrgyn mary his most dear mother.
were come to dew age. Cuius, whose most innocente life. is lykened to
fayrenesse. that god delyteth to see. whose works soueraynely pleasant to
god. are vnderstonded by the swetnesse of the fruytes. And by the shadow. of
her may den^y womb. whom the vertew of the highest be shadowed. Preseius
itaque, Therefore Abraham knowing that this vyrgyn that should bring furthe
god should come of his generacyon* he was more comforted of her. then of all
sons and daughters of his kynred. Hanc denique, And this faith. and holy
hope. that is to say. of the birth of the son of god. that was to come of
the progeny of the same Abraham* the same Abraham left for heritage for great
faith to Isaac his son. Genes. xxiiii.
And that is well proved in that. that he made his seruante whom he sent for
the wife of his son. ^^swere upon (...) by him that should (...) coming.

without brgynnynge. that (...) had most joy of her or any thing was made and
right so he gave his friends greit comfort also. (...) that she should be
borne, B^sic. And so. as first to a^gels and after to the first man. right
so afterward to patriarchs also. was given great comfort of the gloryouse
mother of god to be borne. R. Intelligens, Abraham vnd^rstandynge that (...)
that come of him. should be like to the startes* ioyed more (...) the. and of
thy son. O. fynder of grace. then of all other daughters and sons of his
ly^age. Uerse. Exultet, Therefore our company more be glad. and holy joy of
the. and of thy blyssed son. as well^ as father Abraham. Benedyccyon.

Amen.

The third Lesson.
UEre caritatis, This lesson relly^h. how the holy prophets ioyed. and were
comforted in all disease by for knowing. that they had of the coming of our
lady. Vere caritatis. God is the lover of very charity. and god is the self
charity. that showed also great charity to his when he delivered the people of
Israel by his power out of the thraldom of Egypt. geuynge them a so^de most
plenteous. wherein they should dwell in prosperyte with all fredome. Horu^
quippe But the gylefull enmye. having full great envy to their prosperyte.
drew them with his cauellacions vnnu^berably for to sin. Illi autem, And they
not laboring to wythsto^de the deceytes of the fend. were wretchedly led to
the worshypynges of Idols. setting at naught the law of Moses. and
forgettyng and most folyly dispisynge that couenau^te that god made with
Abraham. Respiciens vero, But after this mercyful god beholdynge his fre^des
that served him devoutly with right faith. and true charity and with keeping
of the law* vysyted them mercyfully. And that they should be the more feruente
in gods service. he set up prophets amongst them. that by them the enmys of
god should turn again to his love. and to right faith if they would. Vnde
vere, wherefore yt is verily to know. that as a hasty floude that should come
down frem the top of a mo^nte in to a deep vale. should bring all things
yt flowed therwyth in to the vale. which after meuyng of the water should be
seen appear* right so the holy ghost vouched safe to slide into the hearts of
the prophets bringing with him out of their lyppes tho words which he
would show to the correccyon of this errynge world. Inter omnia, But amongst
all things that slydde unto them by this sweet flowde of the holy gooste* this
flowed most swetely in to their hearts. and this flowed most delectably
out of their lyppes* that god maker of all things. sh^lde vouche safe to be
borne of a clean virgyn. and that with his amendment and satysfaccyon. he
should by again tho sowlles to endelesse bliss. which sathanas by the sin
of Adam had thrown down in to the sin of wretchedness. Noueru^t etiam,
They knew also of the inflowynge of this flowde. that god the father would be
so well wylled to man's delyueraunce. that he should not spare his only
begoten son. and that the son would be so obedyente to the father. that he
should not deny to take a dedly body. And that the holy ghost would most
gladly be sent with the son* and yet he was never departed from the father.
Sed hoc etiam. But this was also open enough to the prophets. that. that son
of right we^nesse gods son. should not come in to the world. till there
were risen a star out of Israel. that might with his heat touch to the heat
of the son. Per hanc, Therefore by this star is vnderstonded. the vyrgyn
that should bring furthe god. Per calorem, And by the the heat. is
vnderstonded her most feruente charity. whereby she should so towche to god.
and god to her. that god should fulfylle with her all his will. Et vere, And
verily as Prophets gatte comfort in words. and warkes of his son unmade.
and making all things* right also god gave them great comfort in their
trybulacyons by this forknoweynge. by which they knew that this star. that
is mary. should be made. Dolebant enim, For the prophets sorowed greatly.
seeing the sons of Israel forsake the law of Moses. for their pride and
flesshely lust. and seeing the ire of god fall upon them. the charity of god
being far from them. Exulrabant autem But they ioyed knowing yt the self
lord and maker of ye law. should be pleased by thy meekness. and of ye
clenes of thy life. O. mary sterre most bryghte. and yt he should receive them
in to his grace. that had provoked him to ire. and wretchedly run in to his
indignacion. Dolebant insuper, Farthermore the prophets were sorry. for the
temple of god was destroyed. wherein the offerynges of god should be offered.
But they ioyed. seeing that the temple of thy blyssed body should be made.
which should receive god himself. in to yt with all comfort. Dolebant etiam,
They sorowed also for the walls and gates of Jerusalem were destroyed. and the
enmyes of god entered. and ouercam yt bodily and sathanas gostly. Sed
exultabant, But they ioyed of the. O. mary most worthy gate. knowing that the
most strong gyaunte that is god himself. should take armure in the. by
which he should overcome the fend and all enmyes. Et sic, And thus verily the
prophets. as well as the patriarchs. were most greatly comforted of the. O.
most worthy mother. Responce. O ineflabiliter, O. little maiden vnsperably
tyche. in a power town. which received the son of the hye king sense unto
her. in to the hawlle of gladness. she fed him with desired delyces. and
gyrthe him about with the armure of power. Uerse. Hic ad patriam, This
ouercomer going again in to his concre. made her quyen in endelesse
praysynge. This little maiden. is our reverence lady. that when she conceived
the son of god was little in age. and little in mekenes. and maiden in
clennes. But she was rich in all graces and virtues The power town. is this
world. which was fulle poor then from all goostly richesse. And therefore yt
was the more marvelous to find so rich a maiden in so poor a town. The
king is the father of heaven that sent his son Jesus christ to this glorious
virgyn. that he should be her son also. And she received him in to her
worshyppfulle womb. which was to him an hawlle of gladness. for he was
pleased and ioyfulle to dwell therein. She fed him with delyces of her
maydenly breasts. For the milk thereof and the fowde that he took of her hands
pleased him as delyces most desyrable. The armure of power is the holy body
that he took of her. where upon he bare meny hard strokes in time of his
passion. and so he overcame all his enmyes and ours. that are the fendes of
hell. And then as a worshypfulle ouercomer. he turned home again. by his
assencyon. and made the same vyrgyn quyne of heaven in her assumpcyon. there to
be had in endelesse praysynge. and worship above all angels and saints.

The first lesson.
ERrant homines. This lesson tellyth. why god gave a law by Moses. to his
people. and how holy a wedlock was betwyxte Ioachym and Anne. And how. and why
the day of her concepcion ought to be had in reverence. Errant homines, Er
then the law was given to Moses. men were long time ignoraunte. not knowing
how they should govern the^ self and their deeds in this life. and therefore
they that were feruente in heat of the love of god. ordained be sely their
deeds and their manners. and they trowed to please god. Al^ vero. But other that
had not the love of god. and did what ever them list. Hor^^ igitur, Therefore
the goodness of god mercyfully condescendynge to their ignorance. ordained a
law by his seruante Moses. by which they should be governed after all the
will of god. Hec denique, And this law taught how god. and the neybur should
be loved. and how wedlock betwyxte man. and woman should be kept after the
law of god. and of honest. so that of such wedlock they should be brought
fourth whom god would make his own people. Et vere, And treuly god loved
this manner wedlock so much. that he ordained to take thereof. the most
honest mother of his manhod. Vnde quemadmo dum^ Therefore as an egle that
flies on hye in the air. and beholds many woddes, should se one tree a far
so sewrely rowted^ that yt might not be rent up. with any blastes of wyndes^
and the body of the tree. were so long and even. that no man might clymbe up
thereby. which stood also in such a place. that yt seemed impossible that any
thing should fall thereupon from above. and the egle bysely beholdynge this
tree. should make therein his neste. wherein he would rest* so god to whom this
egle is lykened. to whose syghte all things present and to come. are clear
and open* while he beheld all the right wys and honest wedlockes. that should
be from the first makeynge of man. unto the last day. he se none like in godly
charity and honest. unto the wedlock of Ioachym and of Anne. Et id circo And
therefore yt plesed him. that the body of his most honest mother which is
vndersto^ded by the neste should be bygotten of this holy wedlock. in which
body he himself should vouche ^afe to rest with all conforte. Congrue, And
conuenyently are devout wedlockes lykened unto fair trees. whereof the route.
is such union of tow hearts. that is to say. that they be wedded together. for
that only reason that worship and glory come thereof to god himself.
Couenienter. The will also of such wedded man or woman is conuenyently
lykened unto fruytefulle branches. when they keep so the dread of god in all
their works. that they love honestly together after the commandment of
god. only by cause of bringing furthe of children to the praysynge of god.
Talium, For the gyleful fend may not atteyne with his myghtes and crafts to
the hynesse of such wedlockes. when their joy is not else. but that worship
and glory be given unto god. and when also no trybulacyon heuyeth them. but the
vnworshypynge and o^ese of god. Tunc autem, Then also seem they to stand in
sure place* when ye plente of worldely worshyppes or of rychesses. may not
draw their hearts unto love thereof or to pride. Vnde quia, wherefore for god
knew before. that the wedlock of Ioachym and Anne should be such* therefore he
ordained that his dwelling place. that is to say the body of his mother should
be gathered thereof. O Anna, O. reuerente mother Anne. how precious tresure
barest thou in thy womb. when mary that should be the mother of god rested
therein. Vere sine, Treuly yt is to be byleued without any doubt. that god
himself loved that matter of which mary should be formed and made. anon when
yt was conceived and gathered in the womb of anne. more then all the bodies of
men and women. bygotten and to begotten of man and woman in all the world.
Vnde venerabilis, wherefore worshypful anne may trewly be called the tresourye
of almighty god for she hid in her womb. his tresoure. lovely to him above
all things. O qm prope, O. how nyghe was the heart of god contynewally unto
his tresoure. O qm pie, O how benygnely and gladly fastened he his eyne of his
majesty unto his tresoure* that says a^terwarde in (...) gospel. ^ath. vi.
Vbi est thesaurus tuus ibi est e^^o^ tuum, That is. where is thy treasure
there is also thy heart. Et ^do^ vere^ And therefore yt is treuly to believe.
that angels ioyed not alytel of this treasure. when they knew that their maker
whom they loved more then themself. loved that treasure so much Qu^propter.
wherefore yt were full conuenyente and worthy that. that day were had of all in
great reverence. on which. that matter was conceived and gathered in Annes
womb. of which the blessed body of the mother of god should be formed. which
god himself and all his angels loved with so much charity. ^e^. Beata matter.
Blessed mother anne. chest of the endelesse king. which hyd in the. the
tresure most acceptable to him. where with he enheryted his only begotten
son. and made nedy folk rich. and delivered wretched prisoners. Uerse.
Exulta, Joy you reverent mother of thy most reverent daughter. which bring

The second Lesson.
DEinde postquam, This lesson tellyth of the puttyng of our ladies soul in to
her body. and of her birth. And how angels and men desired her birth for
diverse causes. Deinde postqm. Farthermore after that blessed matyer had a body
formed in the mothers womb. in couenable time as it was semynge yt to haue^
then the king of all bliss. mored his treasure. putting in to yt a living
soul. Et quemadmodum, And as a be. that flies about flowery fyldes. serchyth
bysely all grasses and herbs that honey may be gathered of. for of his natural
knowing he can discern. where the fayrer flower burgenyth. which flower if he
se yt not yet spring out of the husk. yet he abides nevertheless
delytablely with desire. the spryngyng thereof. that he may use the swetnesse
thereof unto his pleasau^ce* and like wise. god of heaven. that beholds most
clearly al things. with the eyne of his mageste when he se mary yet hyd in the
preuy place of her mothers womb. to whom. he wyste in his everlasting for
knowynge^ that no man of all the world. should be like in all verteu* abode
her birth with all comfort and joy. that by the swetnesse of that maidens
charity. his most plenteous godly goodness should be showed. O qm clare^ O.
how brighte shone that rysynge morrow tide in annes womb. when the little body
of mary. was quyckened therein. by coming of the sowlle. whose birth. angels
and men. desired to see. with so great desire. Verumptamen, Nethelesse^ yt is
to mark. that as men that dwell in tho lands were the son lyghtenyth them
with his beams as well on nights time. as on day time. desire not the
spring of the morrow tide by cause of light. while ye light of the son is
much more clerer then the light of the morrow tide* but for they understood.
that the morrow tide. apperynge. the son shall go up hyer. and their fruytes
which they hope to g^ther in to their barnes^ shall the sooner and the more
par^ytly wax ripe. of the benefyce of the hete there of. Illarum autem, And
they that dwell in such contrees as are covered with darckenesse of night.
are not only glad for that they know the son shall a rise after ye spring
of the morewe tide. but also they are more reioysed. for they understand. that
the morrow tide paste. they may se tho things that they have to do. Consimili
modo, An like wise holy angels that dwell in the kingdom of heaven. desire
not the spring of the morrow tide that is to say. the birth of mary by cause
of light. for the very son. that is god himself. passed never from their
syghte. but therefore they desired the same vyrgyn to spring by her birth in
this world. for they knew well. that god which is lykened unto the son.
would show more openly by this morrow tide. his most charity which is
vndersto^ded by the heat. and that men which loved god should be made
fruitful by good works. and that by the stable perseueraunce in good they
should be made ripe. so that angels might gather them in to everlasting
barnes. which are lykened to heavenly joy. Homines vero, But men of this darcke
world. knoweynge before. the birth of the mother of god^ ioyed not only
thereof for they understood that their delyuerer should be borne of her. but
they ioyed also for by cause that they should se the most honest manners of
this glorious vyrgyn. And for they should ^erue of her more plainly. wha^
should be done and what should be fled. Hec (...) virgo^ This vyrgyn also. is
that rod that I say said before. Isaie. xi.
should com out of the rowte of Iesse. Floremque And prophesyed that a flower
should spring out thereof. upon which flower the spyryte of god should rest.
O virgans met^^bilem, O vnspecable rod. which while yt grew in Annes womb*
the pythe and the meywe thereof abode more gloriously in heaven Hec itaque virgo,
For this rod was so small. that yt turned lightly in the mothers womb. but
the pythe thereof was so great in length and bredeth. that no mind was
suffycyente to think the gretenesse there of. Non enim valuit, This rod
might not bring fourth the flower. tylle the pythe gave yt vertew of
burgenynge by his enter. Nec etiam, Nethe vertew of the pythe apperyd not
openly. tylle the rod gave his moisture unto the pythe. Hec denique. Forsothe
this pythe is the parsone of the son of god. whom though the father begat
before lucyfer* Psalm. 109.
yet he apperyd not in the flower. that is to say in man's body. tylle by the
assente of the vyrgyn. which is vnderstonded by the rod. he took the matyer
of this flower of her most clean blood in her maydenly womb. Et quamuis, And
though the blyssed rod. that is to say. glorious mary. was departed from
her mothers body in her birth. yet the son of god. was no more departed from
the father. when the vyrgyn bare him bode^y in time. then when the father begat
him euerlastyngly without body. Spu^s quoque, and the holy ghost was
vndepartabley in the father. and in the son. from without beginning. for
they are three persons. and one godhed. Responce. Strips iesse, The kynred of
iesse. has brought fourth a rod. and the rod a flower. and upon this
flower restyth the holy ghost. Uerse. Virgo, The vyrgyn mother of god. is the
rod. the flower is her son. Benedictio Matris cristi, The gloriouse birth
of the mother of criste. be to us everlasting gladness. Amen.

The third Lesson.
IGitur sicuteternaliter. This lesson tellyth of three flaum^es of charity of
the blyssed trynyte. to the health of man shynynge in heaven. And of other three
flaumbes of charity of our lady after her birth shynynge in earth. And how
men ought to worship her natyuyte in earth. and to thank. and to praise god
heartily therefore. Igitur sicut. Therefore as there was endelesly one godhed to
the father. and the son. and the holy ghost* so was there never in them
diverse will. Vnde quemadmodum, wherefore like as three flau^bes should come
out of one burning fire. right so out of the goodness of gods will.
three flaumbes of charity. come euenly furthe unto the parfeccion. and making
of one work. Flamma em^, For the flaumbe of charity. coming from the father.
burnt most bryghtly before angels. when they knew. that his will was
benygnely to will give his loved son. Ioannis. iii.
for the delyuer^nce of the thral seruante. Caritatis flamma, The flaum^e of
charity co^ynge from the son. Philipp. ii.
was not hyd. when he would at the fathers will* set himself at naught
taking the form of a seruau^te. Flamma quoque^ And the flaumbe of charity
coming from the holy ghost. was he not less fervent. when he gave himself
ready to show by open warkes. the will of the father. and of the son. and of
himself. Et qmuis, And though ye most feruente charity of this godly will.
shone by all heuens. geuyng vnspecable comfort unto angels. of his charity.
yet again byeng might not come thereof to mankind. after the everlasting
fore ordenaunce of god* till mary were begotten. in whom should be ke^deled so
feruente a fire of charity. that the sweet smoke thereof styeng up on hye* the
fire that was in god should pore yt self in to yt. and slide thereby in to this
cold world. Hec denique, Forsothe this vyrgyn after her birth. was like unto
a new lantern not yet light. and yet it must be light so. yt as the charity
of god which is lykened to three flau^bes. shynyng in heue^s an like wise this
chosen lantern mary. should shine with other three flau^bes of charity in this
dark world. Prima quippe^ The first flau^be of mary shone full brighte before
god when she behighte to keep sekerly her maydenhed vndefowled to the worship
of god unto her death. Hanc vtique, For god the father desired so much this
most honest maidenhed. that he vouched safe to send thereto his loved son.
with his. and the sons. and the holy gostes godhed. Secunda marie, The
second flaumbe of charity of mary. apperyd in that that she bare down her
self bysely in all things. wy^^ vnthynckecable meekness. which certaynely
pleased so much the blyssed son of god. that he vouched safe to take of her
most meke body. that worshypful body which was semly to be enhau^sed ever
lastyngely above all things in heaven and in earth. T^^^ qunque, The third
flaumbe was her obedyen^e in all wise praysable. which drew so the holy ghost
unto her. that by him she was fulfilled with the gifts of all graces. Et qmuis
hec, And though this blessed new lantern. were not lyghtened anon after her
birth. with these ^lawmes of charity: for there was to her as to other little
enfawntes a little body. and a tender understanding. for which she might not
understand the will of god* yet god ioyed more of her. though she had yet
right naught deserved then of all the good deeds of al men and women that
were begotten before her in all the world. Nam que^admodum, For as a good
harper should love an harp not yet ready. which he kn^^^ before verily should
sown most swetely* so the maker of all things loved soueraynely the body and
sowlle of mary. for he knew before that her words. and works should plese him
above all melody. Credibile etiam, yt is also known worthy to be byleue^. that
as the son of mary had parfyt wit anon as he was bycom man in her womb. so
also mar^ after ^er birth received wit and understanding in l^sse age then
other children. Cum ga^dii deus^ Thefore while god and aungel^ ioyed in heaven
of her glorious byrthe^ men also in ye world mote worship her birth with
joy. yeldynge praysynge and glory of their (...) hearts for her. to the maker
of all things. which (...) above all that he made. and ordained her to be

The Hympne.
GAude visceribus, In this Hympne are seven verses. In the first verse ye
call all holy church. and all heaven and earth to praysynge of our lady. In
the three verses following with a part of the first verse* ye show fourtene
things. wherein our lady is to be praised. The first is her noble and worthy
enter in to the world by her concepcyon. and birth. The second is. her holy
conuersacyon in this world. The third is. her most worshypful passing out
of this world. The fourth is. that being vyrgyn she bare a child. The fyfte
is. that she abode vyrgyn ever after. The syxte is. that she gave god so^e^e

His gate she is, for he tu^^ed in to her holy womb. ^amp; took there a bo^^
of man (...)de. and went out of her when he was borne. And yet she is a gate
evermore locked^ for closenes of her vyrgynyte. both in his concepcio^. and in
his birth. The tente is. that she is the star of the world. as she is
called before in ye hympne at lawdes. the star of the sea. or the shypmannes
star. The.xi. is. that she is plenteous. and large in mercy. For as a flower
that spredeth a broad in his fayrenesse. and flows out in swtenesse of
smelle all abowte* so our lady is fair and comfortable to all wretches. that
look to her ward. and gives out to them as a floudde* the swetnes of her
mercyes. The.xii. is that she is. the kings septer or the kings rod. whereof
yt is read in scripture of a king that no man durstene might come to

but if the king, proffered him his rod or his septer to towche This king is

sin of Adam. but by mean of this rod. yt is our blyssed lady. The.xiii.
is. that she is the mother of god. And the.xiiii. is. that she is ye spowse of
the endelesse king. Then in the the other part of the fyfte verse. and in the
syxte verse* ye ask three things. One. to be defended from yuels. not by your
merit. but by her mylde gift. A another. to have by her prayers. peace long
endurynge. And the third. to have endelesse joy of y^ blys of heaven. And in

The first Lesson.
BEnedictum marie corpus, This lesson tellyth of the virtues and fayrenes of
our lady in soulle. and in body. How parfitshe was in her young age. in hope.
and dread. and love of god. How dyscrete she was in abstynence of meat. and
drink. How temperate in sleapynge. and in waking. How stable in aduersyte.
and in prosperyte. How she lo^hed and set at naught all worldely richesse. and
worship How sweet all thing was to her that pleased god. and how bitter all
thing was to her. that was contrary to him. How fair her soul was by these
virtues. in the syghte of god. and of his angels in heaven. And how fair her
holy body was in the syghte of man. to the conforte and profyt of all that se
her in earth. In all these things. ye praise her in this lesson and say.
Benedictum marie corpus, Conuenyentely yt accords to lyken the blyssed body
of mary unto a vessel most clean. and her soul unto a lantern most clear.
and her brain. unto a pytte of waters ru^nynge upon hye. and afterward coming
down in to a deep valey. Nam cuin virgo^ For when the vyrgyn came to that age.
in which she might understand that very god was in heaven. and that he had
made all things. and specially man to his endelesse worship. and that he
should be judge of all most ryghteful. then the wit and understanding ran up
from the brain of the virgyn in to the heyghte of heaven as water ru^nynge out
of a spring well Nam sicut, In hymno ad primas vesperas Natiuitatis domini.
For as the church syngeth. that the son of god went out from the father.
and turned again to ye father. though either of them were never deprted from
other* so the wit. and understanding of the vyrgyn. often styenge up in to
highness of heuens. caughte god stabely by faith. and swetely halsed his most
sweet charity. and turned again to yt self. Hanc quoque And this charity.
with reasonable hope. and dread of god she held most sykerly. so enflawmynge
her own soul by the same charity. that she began to burn in the love of
god. as a fire most feruente. Hic etiam, This wit and also understanding of
the virgyn made her body so subject to y^ soul. for to sarue god that from
thense furthe. the body obayed to the soulle with all meekness. O qin
celeriter^ O how swyftely the wit. and understanding of the vyrgyn. took the
charity of god. O qin prudenter. O how warely she tresowred the charity of god
unto her. Vnde sicut, wherefore like as a lyllye were planted or set that
should fasten yt self to the earth with three routes. by which yt should make
yt self more stable. and sprede up three delytable flowers. to the conforte of
them that beheld yt* so southly the charity of god. sent or sown from god in
to this glorious earth that is to say our lady. fastened yt self to her body
with three virtues most strong. as yt were with three rowces. by which also yt
strengthed the same virgyns body And worshypfully yt at ay^^ y^ vyrgyn as to
the soul with three ornaments. as with three flowers most brighte. to the
gladness of god. and of angels that beheld her. Prima gaudii^ Therefore the
first strong verteu of the vyrgyns body. was the strength of discrete
abstynence. which tempered so in her. mea^e and drink. that any slowthe or
dullness. wtdrewe her never from the service of god. for any surfeit superfluyte
Ne never she was made weke. or feeble. to do yt she had to do. for any
unmeasurable scarsnes. Secu^da vero The second was ye strength of te^perance
of wakeynges. which tempered so her body. y^ for shortness of sleep she was
never dulled by any heaviness. such time as her behooved to wake, ne for to much
sleep. she shorted never in the least point the times ordained of waking.
Tercia quoque, The third was the strength of the strong complexyon of the
vyrgyns body. which made the same vyrgyn so strong and stable that she bare
euenly. bodily labor and disease. and transytory welthe of the body. not
being sorry of any bodily aduersyte. or disease. ne being glad of any bodily
welthe or felysyte. Hoc insuper^ Farthermore the first ornemente or array with
which the charity of god arrayed the vyrgyn as to ye soul. was this. that she
prefar^ed in her heart tho medes that god should give his friends, before the
fayrenes of all things and therefore worldely rychesses were vile unto her as
fylthe most stynkynge. Hoc denique; The second ornamente that arrayed her
soul was this. that she had parfyt dyscrecion in her understanding. how
unlike worldely worship. is unto gostly joy. and therefore she abhorred to here
worldely joy. as corrupt air. that with his stynke quenches the life of
many. in short while. Illud vtique, The third array that made her soul
glorious. was this. that tho things that pleased god. she held most sweet in
her heart And tho things that were odyous and contrary unto god. she held
more bitter then galle. And therefore this will of the vyrgyn drew her soul so
e^^ectually to desire very swetnesse. that her behooved not to taste gostly
bytternesse after this life. Ex hus, of these ornamen^es. the same vyrgyn
apperyd so fair arrayed in soul above all things that were made* that yt
pleased god the maker. to fulfylle by mean of her. all his behestes. Erat
enim, For she was so strengthed by the vertew of charity. that she failed in
no good work. and the enmy prevailed never in her. in the least point. Vere
procul dubio, Ueryly without any doubt yt is to believe. that as her soul was
most fair ageynste god. and his angels* so her body was most acceptable in
the eyne of all that beheld her. Et quemadmodum, And as god. and angels ioyed
in heaven of the fayrenesse of her soul* right so the fayrenesse of her body
most acceptable. was profitable and confortable in earth. to all that desired
to se her. Videntes enim, For they that were devout, seeing her with how much
feruoure she served god* were made more faruente to gods worship. In hus
autem, And in them that were most ready to sin* the feruoure of sin was
quenched anon by the honest of her words and berynges. as long as they
beheld her Responce. Sancta, Holy and vndefowled maydenhod. I wot never with
what praysynges I shall speak of the. For thou have given him to thy lap whom
heuens might not take. Uerse. Benedictatu, Blyssed be thou in all women. and
blyssed be ye fruit of thy womb. Benediccion. Vi^go, The vyrgyn that was
gryete of an aungel. vouche safe to do away our sins. Amen.

The second Lesson.
NUlla lingua, This lesson tellyth. how our most reuerente Lady. knowing
that god made her. and that he should be agenbyer of mankind* dressed her
will alonely to his love and service How she was then aferde to dwell with
her friends lest she should be hyndered by them from gods service. How
besely she was to keep her tongue. and her ^^ghte and all the wits. and
members of her holy body. clean from all unprofitable things; to the worship.
and glory of god. How glad she was to suffer trybulacyons* and how parfyt in
all goodness and verteu. wherefore god loved her above all things and sent
gabryel to gryete. and his only son to become man in her most holy womb
Therefore ye say thus. Nulla lingua, No tongue may tell prudently the wit and
understanding of the glorious vyrgyn. conceived and understood god himself in
the same point that she had first knowledge of him. namely while all men's
mind is to weyke and febel to think. how much the blyssed will of the same
vyrgyn made her self subject to the service of god. for yt pleased her to do
all things with delight. that she knew plesed god In^ellexit enim, For the
virgyn understood that not for her merytes god had made her a body and soulle.
and given her fredome of her will. both mekely to favor gods
commandments. and also to withsto^de them if her list. And therefore the
most meke will of the vyrgyn utterly determined to sarue god with all charity.
as long as she lived. for the benefytts that she had then received. though he
should never give her other thing after. Cum autem, But when her understanding
might know. that the same maker of all things. sulde vouche safe to be also
the agenbyer of the soulles that he had made. and that he desired not else to
be given unto him for reward of so great labor but the same souls. and yt
every man has fredome in will to plese god by good works. or to provoke him
to wrath by evil deeds* then ye will of the vyrgyn began besyly to govern
her body in tempastes of the world. as a wise shypman his ship. Nam sicut. For
as a shypman dredyth. that his ship should perysshe by waves. or castaynge of
waters. and the pereyles by which ships are often broken. g^eth skante out
of his mind. and dresseth surely the ropes and ship tacle. And his eyne
beholden bysely toward ye haven where he desires to rest after his labor.
and he labors that the goods which ar put in his ship. come to profyt of
the true owner. whom he loved most* so trewly this vyrgyn most ware and
wise, anon after she had knowledge of the commandments of god the will of
her began to govern her body with all besynes. after the blowyng of them.
Frequenter quidem, And often she dredde the dwelling nigh her kynne or
neighbors. lest that her prosperyte. or aduersyte which ar lykened to the
tempests of the world should. by words. or deeds make her the more heavy to
sarue god. Omnia quoque, And all things that were forboden by the law of god.
she commended besyly to her mind. fleing them with all dylygence. lest as an
hard pareyle of the fee they should lose her soulle spyrytually. Hec den^que,
Fo^othe this praysable will tamed so and refrayned this vyrgyn and her wits,
that her tongue was never meued to unprofitable spekynges. And her (...) most
honest. were never lift up. to behold any vnnedeful thing. Her eres were
only lystenynge to tho things that longed to the worship of god. And she never
put out her hands. ne her fyngers. but to the profyt of herself. or of her
neighbor. And her fete she suffered never to move one pase. but if she
dyscussed first what profit should come thereof. Desiderabat insuper, And
furthermore the will of the vyrgyn desired to suffer joyfully all trybulacyo^s
of the world. that she might come in to ye haven of treuthe. that is. in the
bosom of god. the father. This she desired without ceasynge. that worship and
joy should be yielded of her soulle. for her making. unto god. which was
most dear loved unto her. Et quia voluntas, And for the will of the vyrgyn
failed never in any goodness. therefore god from whom all good things go
furthe. enhaunsed her most hye. in the hyenesse of all virtues. and made her
shine most bryghtly in the fayrnesse of all virtues. Quis igitur, who therefore
ought to marvel. that god loved this vyrgyn most above all* while he knew
none that ever should be begotten of man and woman. whose will should not be
bowed at no time to deadly or venyall sin. she only except* O quantum, O
how nigh touched this ship. that is to say. the vyrgyns body. unto the most
desired haven. that is. to the dwelling of god the father* when Gabryel came
to her and said. Aue gracia plena, Luce. primo.
Heyle full of grace. O qm honest, O how honestly the father sent his son
to the vyrgyn with out the workynge of man* when she answered unto the aungel.
Fiat michi secundum verbum tuum, Be yt to me after thy word. Confestim nanque,
For a non the godhed was united unto the manhed. in the virgyns womb. and very
god the son of god the father. was made man. and the son of the vyrgyn.
Responce. Videte miraculum, Se ye a miracle. The lords mother being a vyrgyn
has conceived. not knowing man's felyshyp. Mary stands laden with a noble
burden. and knows her self a merry mother. that knows not her self a wife.
Uerse. Hecspeciosu^. She has conceived with chaste bowels him that is fair
in shape before the sons of men. And she being blyssed without end. has
brought forth god and man to us. Benediccion. Nos cum prole. The vyrgyn mary
mote bliss us. with her merciful son. Amen.

The third Lesson.
OConiunctionem. In this lesson ye are informed of four things. First of the
marvelous incarnacyon of our lord Jesus christ. How the son of god. though
he were in the vyrgyns womb. he was never the less in heaven. with the father
and with the holy ghost. And how the father and the holy ghost. were always
with the son in the world. though the son alonely were become man. And
how in the mother was always maydenhed. and in the son was always godhed.
These ^onde thing. that ye are informed of. is. to thank and to love our
lord Jesus christ for his incarnacyon. and our redempcyon. The third thing
is. of his marvelous enter in to the vyrgyns womb and of his long abiding
therein. and of his marvelous going thense. The forth is. that all folk
should joy of his holy incarnacion. and pray our lady to defend them from the
fyende in their life. and in their death. and to bring them to endelesse life.
O coniunceionem pulcherimam, O that most fair knyttyng to gyther. most
worthy. and acceptable in all wise. Nam erat, For the body of the vyrgyn. was
the dwelling place to the son of god in the world. and in heaven there was to
him the dwelling of the trynyte all though he dwelled over all in each place
by his power. Erat virgo, The vyrgyn was fulle of the holy ghost in body and
soul. and the holy ghost was in the father. He was also in the son become
man. which son of god. had not only his dwelling in the maidens bowels in
the world. but also in the father. and in the holy ghost in heaven. Pater
quoque, The fader also with the holy ghost. had his dwelling in the son
bycam man. all though the only son very god. took unto him man's body.
which though he were hyd after the being of his godhed from man's syghte*
yet before angels in his everlasting dwelling he appeared open and always the
same. Omnes igitur, Therefore all that have very faith. mote joy to gyther. of
that vnspecable knyttynge together. yt was made in the vyrgyn. by which
knyttynge. the son of god took to him a body of mankind. of her flesh and
blood. and the godhed was united unto the manhed. and the very manhed unto the
godhed. In hacsiquidem, And in this most acceptable vnyo^* neither the godhed
was mynysshed in the son. ne ye holenesse of the maydenhod in ye mother. Illi
quoque. Be they therefore asshamed and aferde. which believe not. that the
almyghtynesse of god. might do such things. or think that his goodness
though yt might. would not do such things. for salvation of his creature.
Si etiam. And yt be byleued that of power and of goodness he has done such
things* why is he not perfytly loved of them that doubt not. but that he has
done such things for them* Ammaduertant igitur, Therefore take in your
hearts. and understand that as ye erthely lord were worthy sovereign love.
which. while he were in most worship. and plente of rychesses. herynge his
friend grieved with repreues and dyspites. should of his goodness take upon him
self. all the hurt and disease of his friend. that the same friend might
behad in worship. the same lord also perceiving his friend troubeled with
pouerte should then make himself pour. that the same friend. might be made
rich. And farthermore if he see the same friend wretchedly led unto death.
which he might not escape. but if some man dyed for him will fully. should then
take himself to death. that the same friend dampened to death might live in
welthe* so also. for in these three is showed sovereign love. no man may say
that ever any man showed more love to his friend in the world. then the self
maker that is in heaven. Propterea ipse deus, Therefore the same god. bowed and
enclyned his mageste. coming down from heaven in to the maidens womb.
entering. not only in one party of her body but geuynge himself to ye vyrgyns
bowels by all her body. fourmyng to himself most honestly a body of man of
the flesh and blood of the only vyrgyn. Et ideo, And therefore that most
chosen mother is lykened co^uenyently to the bre^nynge busshe. Exodi. iii.
not hurt with brennynge. that moses se. Nam ille. For he himself which
abode so long in the busshe that he made moses obey and believe tho things
that he told him. and to him asking his name said. Ego sum qui sum, I am
that am. that is. this is my name without end* the same god himself abode in
the vyrgyn so long time. as yt is nedeful to other en fau^tes to abide in
their moders bowels before their birth. Quemadmodum etiam, And as the same
son of god entered with his godhed by all the vyrgyns body when he was
conceived* so when, he was borne with godhed and manhod. as swetnesse comes
out of a hole rose. so came he out by all ye body of the same virgyn the
maydenly glory abydyng hole in the motherr. Vnde quia deus, Wherefore sith god
and angels. and after ward the first man. and after him patriarchs. and
prophets. one with other innumerable friends of god. ioyed. that. yt busshe that
is to say the body of mary. should be so brennynge in charity. yt the son of
god should vouche safe so mekely to enter in to yt. and so long to abide
therein. and so honestly to go out thereof* therefore yt is worthy that men and
women also. now leuynge. be glad with them with all there heart. Quia sicut, Fo as
the son of god. that is very and vndedly god with the father and ye holy ghost.
entered in to this busshe taking in yt for them a dedly body* so ought they in
all haste to fly unto the vyrgyn. that by her prayer endelesse life be
restored unto them that are dedly. which have also deserved by their sines
everlasting death. Et sicut deus, And as god abode in ye vyrgyn lest his body
should have any defaulte in age. or in me^bres. more then the bodies of other
children. that he should myghtely ouercom yt fend. which has gylefully made
all subgette to yt lordeshyp of his cruelte* so also men ought mekely to pray
her. yt she make them abide in their defense. lest yt happen them to fall in
the snares of the fe^de. Quemadmodu^ etiam deus, And also as god went out of
ye same vyrgyn in to the world for to make open the gate of the heavenly co^tre
unto mankind* so ought they mekely to pray her. that she vouche safe to be
present with her help in their out going from this wretched world.
procuring unto them enter. in to the endelesse kingdom of her blyssed son.
R. Felix nanque, Thou art full blyssed holy vyrgyn mary. and most worthy all
praysynge. For of yt is risen the son of right wesnesse. crist our god.v. Ora
pro populo, Pray for the people. by mean of yt clerge. pray for devout women.
and all mote feel thy help. that use to have mind upon the.v. In vterum,
Most hye god co^ down in to the vyrgyns womb. R. In eo, Taking therein the

O Admirabile, O marvelous change. The maker of mankind. taking a quycke body
of a virgyn vouched safe to be borne. and coming furthe man without sede* has
given us his godhed. This is the marvelous change. that he took our manhod.
and gave us his godhed. He came down. and we are lift up. He becam dedly. and
we are delivered from death.

The Hympne.
YSaias que cecinit, This Hympne. tellyth that the prophesy of ysaie the
prophet. is fulfilled in the incarnacyon of our lord Jesus christ. Esaie. vii.
His prophesy was that a maid should conceive and bear a son. as is written
before on so^day in yt chapter at lawdes And also that there should spring a
rod out of the route of Iesse. Esaie. ^i.

other wereful^ylled in our lady. as the Hympne tellyth. when ye say. ysaias,
Tho things tha^ ysaye prophesyed. are fulfilled in the vyrgyn. the au^gel
has done his me sage. and the holy ghost has fulfilled. Maria, Mari has
conceived in womb by the true sede of word The maidens bowels bear him. that

the rod has brought fourth fruit. The fruyteful mother has proffered a

enme should be confounded. Thus is craft deceived by craft. and gyleys turned
in to his door. Therefore pray^ynge and glory be to the son with the mother.
and to the mother with the son. to whom angels song praysynges on hye.
Benedicamus deuotis, Bliss we with devout soulles the great lord. souckynge

The Hympne.
AUemaris stella. This hympne has seven verses. In the first verse ye praise
our lady of four things. One is. that she is called the star of the sat.
for as that is confortable to shypmen so is our lady conforte to all that are
in bytternes of trybulacyon. or temptacyo^ in the sea of this world. And
therefore her name Maria, is as much to say. as star of the sea. And so Aue
maria, and Aue mari^ stella is all one sentence. The second is. that she is
the mother of god. The third is. that she is everlasting vyrgyn. The fourth.
that she is the gate of heaven. ^oan. 1^.
Her son callyth himself in his gospel. (...)i^re. For as a man may not
welcome into an^^^ole but by the door. ne to the door. but by the gate ^ so may
there none come in to heaven. but by our lord Ie^^ ^riste. that is the door. ne
to our lord Jesus criste. but by our lady. that is the gate. Therefore ye say
thus to her. Aue maris stella, Hayle star of the sea. holy mother of god. and
always vyrgyn. the blyssed gate of heaven. In the second verse ye praise our
lady of tow things. and one thing ye ask of her. First ye thank her for
that she assented to the gretynge of Gabryel. for thereby began over health.
like as our perdicyon began by the assen^e of Eve to the fend. The second
for she has turned the woe y^ Eve brought us to. in to joy. And so she has
changed her name. Eua in to Aue for eua spelled bakwarde makes Aue and eua,
is as much to say as woe. And Aue is a word of joy. Then ye ask of her.
stablenes of peace. and say thus. Sumens illud aue, Taking that Aue. of the
mouth of gabryel* ground ^s in peace. chaungeynge the name of eve. In the
thyr^e verse ye ask of her four things. that man needs to have help in.
after he is fallen to sin. For by sin he fallyth in four great mysthyues.
One is. that he is so bound therein. that he may not of himself come out
thereof. And as a man may yield him self bound to a lord. but he may not be
fre ageyn after. when he will* right so is yt of a man that makes himself
thralle to the fend by dedly sin. And therefore ye pray our lady that she
will lose the bonds of sinners. and make them fre. Another mysthyef is. that
when a man is fallen to deadly sin. the fend blyndeth him so in his synn.
that he can neither se the pareyl yt he stands in. ne how to get him help
of delyuerau^ce. And therefore in this ye ask our ladies help. The third
mysthyef is. the great vengaunce that man deserves by sin. both temporal
and everlasting. And the fourth is the loss of all goods of grace and glory.
And therefore ageynste all these four mysthyefs. ye pray to our lady and say.
Solue vincla reis, Lose thou the bonds from them that are gylty. for the
fyaste. Give thou light to them that are blind. for the second. Do away our
yuels. for the third. And ask all goods. for ye fourth. In the fourth
verse. ye pray her to show herself a mother. to god and to wretches. as a
mother tendereth her child in all manner pareyl. and disease that he is in. so
she vouched safe to show motherly tenderness to us. in all our needs bodily and
gostly. And as a mother may get of her son what she will resouably desire
of him* so she vouche safe to speed our erandes agenst god. that yt appear well
that she is his mother. Therefore ye say thus to her. Monstrate, Show the to be
a m^der. and he mote take prayer by the. that vouched safe to be thy son for
us. In the fyfte verse ye praise her in tow virtues. that is. maydenhed. and
myldenesse. and ye ask of her three virtues. according to the same. that is
delyueraunce from sin. myldenesse. and chastyte. Therefore ye say thus. Virgo
singularis, Singular and mylde vyrgyn amongst all. make us losed from sin.
and mylde. and chaste. In the syxte verse ye ask of her three things. The
first is clean life. The second is. true contynewau^ce therein unto the end.
that ye may then have true passage. And the third is. endelesse joy in the
syghte and behowynge of god. Therefore ye say Vitam presta. Grant us clean
life. make ready a true way. that we seeing Jesus. more evermore be glad. In the
seven the verse. ye praise the blyssed trynyte. and say. Sit laus, Praysynge
and worship be to god the sovereign father. to christ. and so the holy ghost.
one worship to them all three. Amen. Antempne. Gaude eternaliter, Joy thou
endelesly untouched mother that ar^e made all things unto all. to y^ trynyte
sovereign glory. gladness to angels. a delyuerer to prisoners. an heler to them
that are sick. a co^forter to them that are desolate. a promoter to the
righteful. an helper to the synful mother to the son of god. Blyssed mote thou
be ever lastyngely. and blyssed be the fruit of thy womb.

service.

The Hympne.
SPonse iungendo, The first verse of this hympne tellyth. how the father and
the holy ghost. were with our lord jesus christ in his mothers womb. and
therefore they are called his collateral fellows. For collateral is said of one
that is nigh a another by the tone side of him. And for the father is named
before the son. and the holy ghost after the son. and so the son is the
second parsone in myd^es bytwixte the first and the third. that is betwyxte
the fader and the holy ghost* therefore they are called collateral to the son.
as yt were the father by y^ ^one side of the son. and the holy ghost by the
to^her side. The third verse expounds the first and the second. where ye
soul of our lady is called the spowse of christ. wherefore when master Peter
that set your service was in doubt: the fader of heaven spoke to saint
Birgytte and said Say he says to that priest my lover that he make that
hympne. In Extrauaga^ Capitulo.v.
Sponse ^ungendo rilio, to stand as he has set yt. For while holy cherche
calls all sowles the spouses of my son. much more may the soul of mary
be called hy^ spowse. Sponse iungendo, The father and the holy ghost were
collateral fellows to the son. that was joined to the spowse. in the chamber
of clere^sse, Stolanous, This noble young lord. y^ clad in a new wedding
robe. ^e goe^h in a fair glory. like in clothing to his spowsesse.

The second Lesson.
OLoriosa virgo maria, This lesson tellyth of three sorrows. or tribulacio^s. of
our gl^ious lady The first was of the dread of god. by which she was full sore
labored. and troubeled. how she might fly yuel. and do good. The second was
of y^ love of god. which caused her bytterly to sorrow for the pains that
criste should suffer. or ever she wist that she should be his mother. The
third was after she had conceived him. while she bare him in her womb. For as
she ioyed then of his co^cepcio^. so she sorowed most in wardely in thinking
on his passyo^. yet in all her trybulacio^s she be had her so patiently. and in
her joys so warely* that yt was both joy to god. and to his angels in
heaven. and conforte and edifycacion to men that ^e her in earth. This lesson ye
begin thus. Luce. prim^.
Glorio^a virgo maria, It is read. that the glorious vyrgyn mary. was aferde
in the gretynge of the aungel. which sothely had then no dread for any pateyle
of her body. but she dread lest the deceyte of the enmy of mankind had come
unto her. to y^ hendrynge of her s^wle. Vnde vere inrel ^gendu^ est. wherefore
yt is verily to understand that when she came to such age. that her might
and understanding might receive y^ knowledge of god and of his will* anon as
she began resonably to love god. so she began also resonably to dread him.
Co^g^ue ^aque. Therefore this virgyn may co^uenyently be called a florysshynge
rose. for as a rose is wont to grow amongste thorns. so this worshypful
vyrgyn. grew in this world among tribulacions Et quen admodu^, And as. the
more the rose spredeth a broad in growyng. y^ more stronger and sharper is made
y^ thorn* right so this most chosen rose mary. the more that she grew in
age. the more sharply she was pry^ked with the thorns of stronger trybulacio^s.
Trans^ur^a den^que, For after her yo^ge age was paste. the dread of god was to
her the first trybulacion. for she was not only troubled with most great
dread in dysposynge herself to fly sins. but also she was labored with no
little dread. in beholdynge how she might resonably. and pa^fytly do good
deeds. Et quamuis, And though she ordained with all watch and dylygence. her
thoughts. Words. and deeds. to the worship of god* yet she dredde that so^me
defaute was in them. Considerent igitu^, Behold they therefore that are
wretched sinners. that boldly and wylfully without ceasynge do the lusts of
diverse wyckednesses* how great torments. and how great wretchednesses. they
gather. and hepe to their own sowles* when they se that this glorious vyrgyn.
clean from all sin. did with dread her works. which pleased god above all
things. Deinde, Farthermore understanding of the scriptures of prophets.
that good would become man. and that he should be tormented with so many diverse
pains. in the body that he should take* anon thereof the suffered great
trybulacion in her heart. for the feruente charity that she had unto god. all
though she knew not yet then. that she herself should be his mother. Cum
autem^ But when she came to that age. that the son of god was made her son.
and felt that he had taken that body in her womb. that should fulfylle by
himself the scryptures of prophets. then that most soft role. seemed to
grow. and more to be spread abroad in her fayrenesse. and y^ thorns of
tribulacion. pryckyng her more bytterly. were made stronger and sharper from
day to day. Nam sicut. For like as in the conception of the son of god. there
sprange unto her a great. and an vnspecable joy* right so in the thinking
of his most cruel passion y^ was to come. many fold trybulacio^ smote upon
her heart Gaude bat nanque, For the vyrgyn ioyed. that he son should with very
meekness bring again his friends to the bliss of the kingdom of heaven* to
whom the first man had by his pride deserved y^ pain of hell Dolebat vero,
But she sorowed for she knew before. y^ like as a man had sinned in paradyse
in all his members by wicked concupysence* so her son should do satysfaccyo^
in the world. for the same man's trespace by most bitter de^he. of his own
body. Exultabat virgo, The vyrgyn ioyed. for she conceived her son without
sin. and flesshely delectacyon. whom also she bare without sorrow. Tristaba^^
quoque But she was heavy. for she knew before. y^ her so sweet son. should be
borne to most foul death. and that she herself should behold his passions
in most anguysshe of heart. Gaudebat etiam, The vyrgyn ioyed also. for she
knew before that he should arise from death. and that he should be enhaunsed
euerlastyngly in sovereign worship. for his passion* yet she sorowed. for she
knew before that he should be greatly payned with spyteful repreues and hard
torments. er he came to that worshyp^ Vere indubitanter, It is verily to be
trowed. wythouten any doubt that as the rose is seen standing stably in his
place. though the thorns that stand about be made more strong. and more
sharpe^ so this blyssed rosemary. bare so strong an heart. that though the
thorns of trybulacio^s pricked her heart never so mother. yet they changed
not her will. in any wise. but that she gave herself most r^dy to suffer and
to do. whateuer should please god. Florenti ergo, Therefore she ye most worthy
lykened ^o a rose. and verily to arose in ^herico, for as men redeth. that a
rose of that place passes in his fayrenes other flowres^ ry^hte so mary was
most excellent ^n fay^enesse of honest. and o^ manners. above all living in
thy^ world. except only her blyssed son. Vnde sicu^. Wherefore like as god.
and au^gelles. ioyed in heaven of her virtuous stablenesse* right so men^
beholdynge how pacyently she behaved her in tribulacions. and how warely in
comfortes. wyed right greatly of her in the world. Respo^ce Sicut spinarum,
As the nynesse of thorns lessyth not the smelle of the florysshynge rose*
right so. mother of christ. the gretenesse of tribulacions might not less in
the. the vertew of stablenes. for thou smelledyst with the sweet smelle of all
virtues. Verse. Assiste spes. Be thou that art our hope. ready present to us
thy meke servants in help. that neither prosperyte lift us vpne aduersyte
bear us down. Benediccion. Qui nos saluauit, He that has saved us. with the
price of his blood* defend us by y^ prayer of the vyrgyn his mother. Amen.

The second Lesson.
INter alia. This lesson tellyth of the sorrows that our lady suffered after
the birth of her son. unto the time of his passyo^. For she understood the
words of the prophets. better then did the same prophets themself. And
therefore knowing by her prophesy what pains her son should suffer in all
his holy body* she sorowed greatly as often as she beheld tho parties of his
body wherein he should suffer specyal pains. So much. that had not be his
often confortes* she might not have abyden the time of his passion with her
life And thus begins the lesson. Inter alia. Amongste other things that the
voices of prophets told before of the son of god* they told how hard
death he would suffer in his most innocence body in this world* that men
together with him. should have everlasting life in heaven. Prophetabant, For
the prophets prophesyed and wrote. how the same son of god. for the
delyueraunce of mankind. should be bound. and skourged. and how he should be
led to the cross. and how spytefully he should be treted. and crucyfyed.
Vnde quia, Therefore as we believe that tho prophets knew well. for what cause.
vndedly god. would take to him a dedly body and in so diverse manners be
troubled in the same body* therefore christen faith mote not doubt. but that
our vyrgyn and lady whom god had ordained before all worlds to be his
mother. knew yt more clearly. Ne yt is not righteful to believe that y^ cause
was hyd from the same vyrgyn. why god vouched safe to be clad with man's body
in her womb. Et vere. And verily yt is to believe without any doubt. that she
understood by the inspyracyo^ of the holy ghost all that the speches of the
prophets bytokened or men^e more parfytly. then the same prophets. that of
the same spyryte spoke the words by mouth. Vnde verissime, wherefore yt is to
believe most very. that when ^he vyrgyn. after she had borne the son of god.
byganne first to touch him with her hands* anon yt r^unne in to her mind.
how he should fulfylle the scriptures of prophets. Quando autem. Therefore when
she wound him in clothes. then she beheld in her heart with how sharp
scourges all his body should be rent. so yt he should appear as a lypre.
Recolligens quoque, Also the vyrgyn wrappynge and gatherynge together the
hands and fete of her little son easily in a band. or cradel band. brought
to mind how hard they should be persed thorugh on the cross with nails of
yren. Aspiciens quippe, Beholdynge also she face of the same her son. most
fair in shape before all sons of men: she thought how irreverently the
lyppes of wicked men should defoule yt with their spyttynge. Reuoluebat etiam.
The same mother also. had of ten in her mind. with how great strokes the cheke^
of the same her son should be smytten. and with how great repreues. and
despytes. his blyssed eres should be filled. Modo considerans, Now co^syderynge
how his eyne should wax dark of ye flowynge in. of his own blood* now how
vpnegre medied with galle should be put in to his mouth. Modo ad mentem, Now
bringing to mind how his arms should be bound with ropes. and how his syne
we and al his veins and joints should be drawn out on the cross without
mercy. and how his heart rowtes should be drawn to gyther in his dethe^ and
how ^l his glorious body. must be tormented and payned within. and without
with all bytternesse. and anguysshe unto the death. Sciebat enum, The vyrgyn
also knew well. that a spear most sharp should perse y^ side of her son. and
prycke thorugh the mids of his heart. after his spyryte was passed on the
cross Vnde sicut, wherefore as she was most glad. and joyful of all mothers.
when she se the son of god borne of her. knowing verily that he was both
god and man. dedly in his manhod. but euerlastyngly vndedly in his godhed* so
was she most sorrowful and heavy of all mothers. for the knowing before of his
bitter passion. Per talem enim, And in such wise was her most joy meddled
always with most grievous heaviness. as if yt were said thus to a woman in
child birth. Thou haste brought fourth a son quycke and hole in all his
members. but that pain which thou had in his birth. shall abide with the
unto thy death. Etilla, And she herynge this. should be glad of the life and
health of her son. but of her own passion and death she should be sorry. Talis
vtique, Certaynely such sorrow of a mother that came of y^ bethynkynge of
pain and of death of her own body should not be more grievous* then the sorrow
of ye virgyn mary. as often as she had in mind ye death that was to come of
her most loved son. Intelligebat, The vyrgyn understood. that she sawes of
prophets had told before. that her most sweet son must suffer many and
grievous pains. and also that ryghteful man Symeon. told. not from far as did
the prophets. but in the vyrgyns face. that the sword of sorrow. should pass
thorugh her heart Vnde vere, Luce. secundo
wherefore yt is verily to wit. that as the powers of the soul are stronger
and more ready to feel good or yuel then the powers of the body* right so the
blyssed soul of the vyrgyn. that should be wounded with that sword. was
payned with more grievous sorrows or then her son suffered his passion* then
the body of any woman might suffer. before ye birth of her child. Ille
nanque, For that sword of sorrow. came so much the more nerer every hour and
time to the heart of the vyrgyn* as her beloved son approached more nere the
time of his passion. Vnde sine dubio, Wherefore yt is to trow without any
doubt. that that pyteful and innocente son of god. having sonnely co^passyon
to his mother* tempered her sorrows with often confortes. and else her life
might not have suffered them. unto the death of her son. Responce. ^e
^enniter, O mother of endelesse joy. thy most innocente soul be endelesly
blyssed. thorugh which past the sword of sorrow. And thou sufferedyst yt with
good will. that the sword of endelesse death should not pass thorugh our
frail sowles. Uerse. O ver^^ O most full of true love. grant us to love him
parfytly* that with the blood of his own heart. boughte blyssed life to us.
that were wretchedly dead. Benediccion. Passio virginis, The passion of the
vyrgyns son. commend us to the hands of the highest father. Amen.

The third Lesson.
ED denique tempore, This lesson te^yth of the sorrows that our lady su^^ered
in time of the passyo^ of her holy son. our lord Jesus criste. And how her
life was kept that time by miracle. and by the specyal gift of god. above all
her bodily strengthes. And how after his death. and burynge* she was in manner
conforted knowing that all his pain was ended. and that he should arise the
third day to his endelesse glory and worship. Then ye begin the lesson
thus. Eo denique tempore, what time the vyrgyns son said. Qu eritis me et
non inuenietis, Joan. v^.
That is. ye shall seek me and ye shall not find me* the point of the sword
of sorrow. pry^ked bytterly the vyrgyns heart. Ipso quoque. And farthermore
when he was betrayed of his own dyscyple. and taken as yt pleased him. of y^
enmys of truth. and of right wysnesse* then the sword of sorrow smote
thorugh the vyrgyns heart. and thorugh her heart rotes. and hard passing
thorugh her soul. brought most grievous sorrows. to all ye me^bres of her
body. Tociens enim, For as often as passions and repreues were said agenste
her most loved son* so often was that sword turned in her soul with all
bytternesse. Videbat quidem, She se her son smytte in the neck with wicked
men's hands. and scourged without pytye. and demed of the princes of jews. to
most foul death. and led with his hands bound. to the place of his
passion. all the people ^ryenge do the traitor on the cross^. and then he
beryng the cross on his shuldres. in most werynesse. sum went before him.
and drew him bound after them and other went with him and drove him fourth
with their fystes. and so they haryed. and led that most mylde lamb. as a
most cruel beast and wild. Qui secu^dum, Esaie. liii.
which after the prophesy of ysaye* was so paciente in all his anguysshes*
that as a sheep led to death wtoute voice. and as a lamb being stylle before
him ye clyppeth hi^. so he opened not his mouth. Qui ^icut, And as he showed
all pacyence in himself* so his blyssed mother suffered most pacyently all
her trybulacyons. Et quemadmodum, And as a lamb goes with his mother whether
ever she be led* right so the vyrgyn mother followed her son led to ye
places of torments. Videns quoque, And when the mother se the son scorned
with the crown of thorns. and his face made read of the blood. and his
chekes rody of great buffettes* she wayled in most heavy sorrow and then for
gretnesse of sorrow. her chekes waxed pale Sanguine quippe, And water of
i^numerable teres ran out of the vyrgyns eyne* when ye blood of her son in
his scourgynge. flowed outte by all his body. Videns demde, And farthermore
when ye mother se her son cruelly spredde on the cross* she began to fail
in all the myghtes of her body. Audiens vero, And herynge the sownde of the
hamers when y^ hands and fete of her son were thyrled with nails of iron*
then all the vyrgyns wits faylynge. the gretnesse of sorrow threw her down
on yt earth as dead. Iudeis itaque And when the jews gave him drink galle
and vynegre. the anguysshe of heart dried so the tongue and palate of the
vyrgyn. that she might not then meue her blyssed lyppes for to speak. Audiens
quoque, And afterward herynge that doleful voice of her son. sayng in the
strife and labor of death. ^^th..xxvii.
Deus meus, deus meus vt quid dereliquisti me, That is. My god. my god. why
haste thou forsaken me, And after that. saying that all his members waxed
styffe. and that enclynyng down his head he brethed out his spyrite. then ye
bytternesse of sorrow querkynde. and stopped so ye virgins heart. that no
ioynte might be seen stir. or meue. Vnde non, wherefore yt is known. that
god wroughte not then a little miracle in that. that ye vyrgyn mother wounded
wtin furthe. with so many and so great sorrows. sent not out her spirit by
death. when she be held so much her beloved son hanged betwyxte thieves.
naked and wounded. quycke. and dead. and smytte (...) all folk scornynge him
and nigh all that knew him fleyng away from him. and many of them wrongly
wandrynge from the ryghtnes of fayth^. (...) Therefore as her son suffered
most bitter d^the. above all living in this world* right so his mother
bare. and suffered most bitter sorrows in her blyssed ^owle. Commemorat, Holy
scripture also makes mind. Exodi. xxv.
that god ^ad moses make an ar^e or a cheste and cover yt with gold within and
without. and keep therein tho tables that god wrote with his finger. This arc
was sometime borne of prestes in battle ageynste the enmyes of Israel. Primo.
^e..4.
And ones yt haped y^ for sins of the prestes and of the people. the arc was
taken. and the prestes were slain. And one of the prestes was called phynes.
whose wife being great with child. when she hard that her husband was slain
and the ark of god taken* anon she delivered her child and dyed furthe with.
for gretnes of has^y sorrows that suddenly fell upon her. And this is the wife of
phynes. and the arc that this lesson spekyth of. The sorrows of which woman
might not be lykened to the sorrows of the vyrgyn mary. that se the body of
her blyssed son. which was fygured by the said arc. taken and fastened
betwixt the nails and the tree. Maiori, For the vyrgyn loved her son god and
man with more charity* then ever might any that was begotten of woman love
himself or any other. Vnde quia, And therefore for yt seems marvel. y^ the
wife of phines was dead of sorrows. which was grieved with less sorrows. and
mary lived again. yt was rent with greter sorrows* who might think other
herein but that she kept her life. of the special gift of almighty god.
agenste all bodily strengthes^ Monens. The son of god dey^nge. opened heaven.
and mightily he delivered his friends that were holden in hell R^^^scens, And
the virgyn turnynge again to life kept holely the right fay^hi alone unto
the resurrection of her son. and meny that wretchedly erre^ from the faith.
she correct and brought again to the faith. Mortuus, when her son was
deed. he was taken down of the cross. and wound in clothes and buried. as
other dead bodies. And then all went away from him. and few byleued that he
should arise. Then also the pryckes of sorrow fled from the moders heart. and
delectacion of co^fortes began softely to be renewed in her. for she knew y^
the tribulacio^s of her son were all together ended. and that he should arise
the third day with godhed and manhed to endelesse glory. and bliss. and that he
should ne might from thense furthe. suffer no disease.. R. Palluerunt. The
chekes of the mercyful mother were pale when she se the son of her maydenhed
all red in his own blood. And seeing his hands. and his fete nailed thorugh
she began anon to fail all y^ myghtes of her body. And herynge the doleful cry
of so worthy a son in y^ point of dethe^ sorrows threw her down to the
earth as dead..v. Oinmensam ^ that great charity which drew god. gouern^^re
of all. and the vyrgyn most inocente to suffer such things. that dampened
servants should be saved. Versy. Vidit virgo, The vyrgyn se in the face of her
mercyful son.. R. Qui quorum. The spyttynges of wicked men with the flowynge of

The Hympne.
O Gloriosa, O glorious lady heyued above stars. thou haste given him soucke
with thine holy trates. that made the by his wisdom. Quod eua. Thou haste
restored again by thy holy son. that. that wretched Eve took a way. Thou
art made the wyndowe of heaven. that wepers should enter in to heuens. Tu
regis. Thou art the gate of the hye king. and the brighte gate of light.
Joy ye people again boughte. that life is given by a vyrgyn. In this verse
our lady is called the gate of the his king. for by her our lord jesus
criste came in to this world. She is also called the gate of light. for by
her mankind entered in yt light everlasting. An^. Exaltara es, Holy mother
of god. thou art heyued up to the kingdom of heaven above all co^panyes of
angels. Antempne. Paradisi^ The gates of paradyse ar opened to us by the thou
glorious vyrgyn wherein thou enterydest worshypfully with angels. as an
ouercomer. As to understanding of this antemne. yt is to wit that the gates
of paradyse, and of heaven were shytte to mankind by ye sin of Adam and of
Eve. and (...) our lady. they were opened. for she brought (...) our lord
Jesus criste. which by his passion and his (...). opened heaven gates And (...)
glory our lady in her assumpcyon entered those gates as an ouercomer. as this
antempne (...). For yt was wonce to be used in Rome. that when any Captain had
utterly overcome the enmy^^ of the Cite and won the land or the place that
was (...) ageynste them* then he was received in. at the gates of the City.
with three manner of worshyppes. First all the people of the cite came ageynste
him with joy. and with praysynge. Seco^dely his prisoners that he had taken.
followed after him bound. Thyrdly he was cladde in a gods clothing. and
set in a ryal^ chayr^. that was drawn with four^ white horses. and thus he
was led with worship to the Capitoly. that is the highest place of rome. And
this worship he should have by dome. and assente of his host that was with him
in battle. and of the cenatours. that is to say. the aldermen of the cite. and
of the common people. And this worship was called in latin. Triumphus, and
thereof comes Triu^phas, that is the last word of this antempne. and is as
much to say. as to receive such worship. For all this said worship was done
unto our lady at her enter in to the cite of heaven. by cause she had worthyly
overcome the fend. and won mankind again to god by her son. and opende
the gates of heaven. as is before said. Therefore as the people of rome came
agenste such a vyctoure* so all the company of heaven came joyfully to welcome
our glorious lady in her assu^pcion. And as his prisoners folow^^ abou^de
after him so all fendes are as thral prisoners to our lady. and follow after
her so sore bound. that they dare nothing do ageynste her bidding. And also
as thy^ vyctoure was clad in a gods clothing* so was ye glorious soul of
our lady endewed and clad with three dowryes of joy of the blyssed trinyte
above al other creatures. And as he was satte in a chair. drawn of four
white horses* so the chair of our ladies soul. that is her holy body. was
taken up. and gloryfyed with the soul in four dowryes. that long to the
body. And as he was led thus. to that highest place of rome* so our most
reuerente lady. was set highest in heaven next unto god. And as this vyctoure
had his worship by the assente of the host. and of the senators. and of the
people* right so to the worship of our mighty ouercomer this glorious quyene
our lady. were assented with great joy all the host of angels and the
senate of the patriarchs and prophets. and the common people. of all holy
sowles that then were in heaven. as ye may se afterward in the second lesson
of this same saturday. which accords much to all this matter. And this I
have written upon this antempne. for the last end seems darckely spoken.
without that yt have some declarynge.. An^. Speciosa, Thou art made fair and
sweet in thy delyces holy mother of god..v. Ecce mulier, Lo the woman. that
brekyth the head of the gyleful serpente. R Prothoplaustorum, That had enmefully
envy to the glory of them that were made. That is to say. of Adam. and Eve.
that were made first of all mankind. Bn^diccion. Confirmet nos. The glorious
mother of god most pyteful. mote co^ferme us in faith most holy. Amen.

The first Lesson,
DE longinquis partibus, This lesson lykeneth our blyssed lady to a quyene of
a land yt is called Ethiopia, or Saba, which is called here. and also in the
gospel. the quyene of ye sowthe. ^ath..xii.
by cause that her lord was sowthwarde from iherusalem. This quyene hard
tell of the wisdom and of the richesse of king Solomon. 3. Regum. 10.
and therefore she came to iherusalem to se him. and to speak with him. And when
these all the glory that he was in. and his wysdom. she was so a wondered
thereof. that she was all out of herself and sowned for marvel. And how all
this is understood of our lady. this lesson tellyth. wherein is showed by this
said example of the quyene. how our holy lady behaved her before the
incarnacio^ of our lord Jesus christ. and in time of his passion. and after.
and in the day of his resurreccion. and after his assencyon. unto her
assumpcio^ De longinquis partibus, yt is red that the quyene of the sowthe came
from far co^tryes to king Solomon. and seeing his wisdom. she had no spyrite
for great wonder. But when she had taken strengthes again. she praised the
king with her words. and worshyped him with great gifts. Huic vtique, To this
quyene. is co^uenyently lykened the most excellent quyene the vyrgyn mary.
whose soul wisely searching the order and process of all the world. from the
beginning thereof unto the end. and dylygently beholdynge all things that were
therein. found nothing therein, that she should desire to have or to here^ but
only yt she hard of god. Illam itaque, But that she sought with all desire. and
that she spyed bysely. till she had wisely four be that wisdom that is christ.
the sone of god. which is wythouten comparyson more wise then Solomon. ^
Videns autem, And the same vyrgyn seeing how wisely he wanne again sowles. by
the passion of his body on the cross. and opened the gates of heaven to them.
whom the gylefulle enmy had won to the death of hell* then this vyrgyn was
more nerer death. then was the quyene of the sowthe. when she seemed so have no
spyryte. Christi deinde, And farthermore when the passion of christ the son
of god and hers. was ended* then ye same vyrgyn took stre^gthes again and
worshyped god with gifts most acceptable unto him. For the presented to the
same god mo sowles. with her holsom doctrine. then did any other parsone after
the death of Christ with all their works. In hoc etiam, yt is also proved that
she commended him worshypfully with her words. in that that after the death of
his manhod. when many were in all wise in dowte of him. she alone affermed
most stablely. that he was the very son of god. endelesly undeadly in his
godhed. Tercia quippe die, And the third day when the dyscyples dowted of his
resurreccyon. and the women sought his body bysely in the grave. and the
apostles themself for great an(...) of heart and dread* closed them in to
gyther (...) the vyrgyn mother though the scripture make no mind that she
spoke any thing that time. yet it is to believe without dowte. that she
wytnessed that the son of god was arysen in body to endeles glory and that.
death should never more from thense furthe have lordeshyp over him. Item
quamuis, And also tho the scripture say. ^
that mawdeleyne. and the apostles se first the resurreccion of criste* yet
without dowte yt is to believe. that his most worthy mother knew yt verily ere
then they. and ere then they she se him a live arysen from death wherefore she
was most fulle of joy of heart. and praised him mekely. Ascendente vero, And
when her blyssed son ascended up to his glorious kyngdome^ the vyrgyn mary
was suffered to abide in this world to the conforte of the good. and to the
correccion of them that erred. Erat enum, For she was the maystresse of the
apostles. the confortoure of martyrs. the techer of co^f^ssoured. the most
clear my roure of vyrgyns. the confortoure of wydowes. the most wholesome
cou^seyloure of them that lived in wed lock. and most parfyt strengther of
all. in the common right faith. Apostolis nanque, For she showed and resonably
declared to the apostles. when they came unto her. all things that they knew
not parfitly of her soune: Martyrs queque, And martyrs she hearted to suffer
joyfully trybulacyons. for the health of them. and of all. affermyng that she
herself three and thyrty year before the death of her son suffered
contynewally tribulacyon of ha^^^ in all pacyence. Confessores, Farthermore she
taught co^fessoures techynges of health (...) most parfytly of her doctrine
and example. discretely to ordeyne the times of the day and of the night to
the praysynge of god. and resonably and spyrytually to temper. sleep. and
mete. and bodyly labor. Ex eius quippe, Uyrgyns also learned of her most
honest manners. to govern them honestly, and to keep se werly their maydenly
clennesse. unto the death. to fly much speech. and all vanytyes and to
dyscusse all their works with busy thinking before. and to examyne them
most ryghtfully by spirytual weyghte in even balaunce, Videns etiam, The
glorious vyrgyn told wydowes also to their conforte. that though yt pleased
her of motherly charity. that her most loved son should have no more will
to have dyed in manhodde. then in godhed* yet her motherly will conforted her
all together to the will of god. chusynge rather to suffer mekely all
trybulacyons. to the fulfyllynge of gods will. then for to dyssente from
gods will in any thing. for any plesaunce of herself. Tali enim, And with
such speaking. and words she made wydowes hertes. pacyente in trybulacyons.
and stable and strong in bodyly temptacyons. Co^sulebat insuper, Farthermore
she cou^sayled them that were wedded. to love them together to body. and to
soul. withthrew. and not feigned charity. and to have an undepartable will. to
all that were worship to God. telling them of her self. how she gave her
faith clearly to god. and how for his love. she never wtstode yt will of god
in any thing.. R. Beata es virgo, Uyrgyn mary mother of god. you art blyssed.
which haste byleued to the lord. Tho things are fulfilled in the. that were
said unto the Lo show art lift above the quyers of angels. Pray for us to
the lord Jesus christ..v. Aue maria, Hayle mary full of grace the lord is with
the. Benedic. Filius marie, The son of the virgyn mary. mo^e cleanse us. from
the fylthe of sin. Amen.

The second Lesson.
OVoniam exsacri, This lesson tellyth of the assu^pcyon of our ladies soul
how yt was set next unto god. and what soueraynte god gave her above all the
world. and angels and fendes. And how meekness was the cause of her great
glory in heaven. And how all angels and holy sowles in heaven ioyed of her
coming. And how great a ^^ste god made them. at the coming of that gloryouse
soul amongst them. And how the apostles in earth with joy and praysynge
buried her holy body. which was afterward taken up. to endelesse bliss.
Quoniam exsacri, For as much as we have learned of the tenoure of the holy
gospel. Luce..vi.
yt yt shall be met again to each one by the same mesure. yt he metyth to
other. therefore yt semyth vnposyble. yt any man might co^prehende or
understand by man's reason. with how great worshypes the glorious mother of god.
ought to be worshyped of all. in ye paleys of heaven. which wroughte benyngly
desired goods to so many. while she lived in this world. Idci^co iustu^,
Therefore yt is byleued to be ryghtful. yt when yt pleased her son to call
her fro this world. all yt had the perfytful fyllyng of her will. by her.
were ready to thencrese of her worship. Vnde quia, wherefore. for the maker
(...) all things fulfilled his pleasau^te will in the worldde by mean of
her^ therefore yt pleasyd him with angels with him. so gloryfy her in heaven.
with sovereign worship. Etid^ir^o, And therefore god hymsel^^ heyued the virgyns
soul. anon when yt was departed from the body. above all heuens and gave her
the empire upon all the world and ordained her to be endelesly lady of
angels. Qui quidem, which angels (...) afterward so obediente to the vyrgyn
that they would lever suffer all the pains of hell* then they should in any
thing ageynsay her precepts. Super (...), God also made her so mighty above
all wicked spyrites* y^ as often. as they ympugne any man yt of the rite asks
ye virgyns help* anon at ye same virgyns will. they are aferde and fle far
a way. wyllyng^ rather their pains and wretchedness to be multiplied unto them.
then the power of the same virgyn should have lordeshyp upon them in such
wise. Et quia, And for as much. as she was found most meke amongst all
angels, and men. and women. therefore above all things that are made. she is
made most hye. and fairest of all. and above all most like unto god himself.
Vnde vere, wherefore yt is verily to know. that as gold is had more worthy
then other metals: so angels and souls ar more worthy then other creatures.
Igitur quemadmodu^, Therefore as gol^^ may not be formed in to any works without
the ben^^yte of fire. and by putting to of fire yt is made in to diverse
forms. after yt craft or wisdom of the goldesmyth. right so the soul of
the most blyssed vyrgyn. might not be made more fayrer then other sowles and
angels* but if her will that was ever best, which is lykened to a crafty
goldesmythe. had made her ready before. to the most brennynge fire of the holy
ghost. so effectually. yt her works should appear most acceptable to the maker
of all things. Et quamuis, And though gold be fourmed in to fair works.
yet the craft of the goldesmythe is not clearly seen. as long. as that work
that is made. is closed in a dark house. but when yt comes in to the light
of the son. then the fayrenesse of the work begins to show more clearly
therein* on the same wise also. the most worthy works of this glorious vyrgyn
that arrayed her most precious sowlle in fairest wise. might not parfytly be
seen. as long as ye same soul was kept close. in the hydel of her deadely
body. till the same soul came to the brightness of the very son. that is the
self godhed. Tune denique, But then all the cour^e of heaven. enhaunsed the
same vyrgyn with sovereign praysynges. by cause that her will had so arrayed
her soul. yt by her fayrenesse. she passed hyly the fayrenesse of all
creatures. for which she appeared most like unto the self maker. Huic ergo,
Therefore there was ordained to this glorious sowle^ from without beginning. a
seat. full of glory most nigh to yt trynyte himself. Nam sicut, For like as
god the father was in the son. and the son in the father and the holy-goste
in either of them. when the son after the taking of man's body. rested in
his moders womb with godhed and manhed. the union of the trynyte in all wise
vndeparted. and the vyrgynyte of the mother kept vndefowled* right so the
same god. ordained to the blyssed vyrgyns soul a man^y on. most nigh to the
father. and to the son. and toche holy ghost. that she should be partener of
all the (...) that might be given of god. Nullus etiam, The hapnesse also of no
heart is suffycyente to think. how great joy god made to his felyshyp in
heaven. when his most loved mother passed from this wretched world, as yt
shall be verily and openly known to all that with charity desire the co^tre of
heaven. when they behold god himself face to face. Angeli quoque. Angels also
ioyenge and thanking the vyrgyns soul. gloryfyed god. for by death of the
body of criste himself. there felyshyp is filled. and by the coming of his
mother there joy is increased. Adam denieque, Adam also and Eve with
patryarkes. and prophets. and all the company that was brought out of hell
and other that come in to bliss after the death of criste ioyed of the coming
of the same vyrgyn in to heaven yeldynge worship and praysynge to god that
honored her with so much worship. that so holyly. and gloriously broughthe
fourth her lord and again byer Apostoli etiam, The apostels also and all the
friends of god that was present to the most worthy dead body of the same
vyrgyn. when her most loved son bare with him her glorious soul in to
heaven* worshyped her with meke service. enhan^synge her worship full body. with all glory. and praysynge that they might. Et vere, And all doubt remeued. yt is
verily to believe. that as that body of the most blessed virgyn was borne dead
to ye sepulture of the friends of god* right so it was worshypfully taken up.

The third Lesson.
QVIA ipsa veritas, This lesson tellyth of the assumpcion and glory of our
ladies most holy body. and how glad Gabryel was of her meke answer. when he
brought her first gretyng from god. with Aue gratia plena, And houwe ought
with all devotion. to say that salutacion. with will to leave sin and to do
good deeds. that we may thereby deserve to have our merciful ladies help.
worthily to receive the most worthy body of our lord Jesus christ in the
sacrament of the altar. which is life and fode both to angels and to men.
Quia ipsa veritas, for as much as the self truth that is the son of god.
Math. v.
and of the vyrgyn has counseylled all to yield good for yuel* with how many
goods. is the same god to be trusted. yt he rewards by himself the doers of
good deeds* Math. xix.
Et quia, And for he has behote by his gospel to give a hundereth fold for
each good work* who may think with how great gifts of reward. he has
made rich his most reuerente mother. which sothely never did the least
sin. and whose good works also most acceptable to god. have no nombre^ Nam
sicut, For as the will of the same vyrgyns soul. was the begynner of all good
deeds* right so also her most honest body was an instrumente most able and
contyne wally pliable. to the proyt doing of the same deeds. Vnde sicut vere,
wherefore as we believe verily. that the right wysnes of god. all men's bodies
shall arise in the fas^eday. and take reward with their sowles as their works
ask. by cause. that as each man's soul was the begynner of all his works.
by putting to of will* right so the body joined thereto. fulfilled them all
by yt self bodyly in deed. Sicut igitur, Therefore as yt is to believe without
any dowte. that as the body of the son of god. that neuersynned. arose from

most worthy mother that never did sin* a few days after yt was buryd. yt
was taken yp with the most holy soul of the same virgyn. by the vertew and
power of god in to heaven. and with all worship. yt was gloryfyed to gyther. with
the same soul. Et sicut. And as yt is imposyble to any man's understanding.
in this world. to comprehend the fayrenesse and glory of that crown wherwyth
yt seemed christ the son of god to be worshyped. and made glorious for his
passion* right so also may no man think the fayrenesse of that crown. with
which the vyrgyn mary is worshyped in body. and in soul. for her godly
obedience. Et quemadmodum, And as all the vertewes of the vyrgyns soul praised
god her maker. whose most holy body was afterward arrayed with the reward of
all virtues* right so also ye works of the vyrgyns body praised the same
vyrgyn. most worthy mother of god. for she left no verteu vnwroughte in the
world. for which she knew. reward to be given in heaven. to body. and to
soul. Vnde vere, wherefore yt is verily to know. that as. except only the
most holy soul of criste. the soul of his mother is most worthy. sovereign
medes, for virtues and merytes. for she had no defaulte in good works* right
so also. except only the body of criste. the body of his mother was most
worthy to receive with her soul the rewards of merytes, longer time then the
bodies of other. for yt fulfilled always with the same soul. all her works
that were ever best. and never consented to any sin. O qm potenter. O how
mightyly showed god his right wysnes. when he cast out adam out of paradyse.
by cause that agenste obedyence. he eat the fruit of the tree of knowing in

mercy in this world by the virgyn mary* which may co^uenieutly be called the
tree of life. Pensate igitur, Think therefore how swyftely rightwysnes cast
them out in to wretchedness. that inobedyently eat the fruit of the tree of
knowing. Considerate etiam, Consider also. how swetely. mercy calls and
draws them unto bliss* that by godly obedience desire to be fed with the
fruit of the tree of life. Attendite insuper^ And furthermore take heed. most
dear beloved. that when ye body of this most honest vyrgyn wexed in the

ioyed no less thereof yt yt should be borne* then of that grace that was done
unto them. that is to say. yt they knew themself. that they should be vndedly
in heavenly joy. and pryncypally that the great charity of god. should be
showed in mankind. and that their felyshyp should encrese thereof. Et ideo, And
therefore the au^gel gabryel hasted him gladly to the same vyrgyn. with a swyfte
pace. and great her charitably with speech most worthy. and acceptable in all

would amend yt sayng thus. Benedicta filia tu a domino^ and so they make tua

Benedicta filio tuo domina, Nethelesse if this saying Benedicta filia tua

your service were set so at the beginning. then ye ought not to change yt

Here ends the story of the Saturday. And thus ar ended all your.vii.
stories.
BUt for as much as yt happyth some time. that some in happes are neglygente
in sayynge. or singing thereof* therefore I bring now to your mind. a short
lesson that our lord jesus christ taught to saint Maute. Libro.iii. sp^a lis
g^e. reuelati on^^. 009. ca. 30
which is full good to use. in ye beginning. and at the end. of each hour of
your service. First by cause that the saying of this service is apaynge of
decte. therefore our lord bad that he that is bound to pay this debt of his
service. should at the beginning of each hour say thus to our lord. both
with heart. and with tongue. or at the least with the heart. Domine in vnion^ qua
ipse in terris lauds deo patri persoluisti, hanc tibi horam persoluo, that is.
Lord I pay this hour to the. in that vnyo^. by which thou being in earth
pay^est praysynges to god the father. And he that thus dressyth his entente up
to god at the beginning. customably. and with busy study. and afterwa^d^ in
time of the same service kepyth stylle his mind and entendeth to god as much
as he may* then as our lord says. that service shall be so noble. and
worthy before god the father. that yt shall be accounted as yt were one with the
service. and praysynge that our lord Jesus criste did himself to the fader
while he was in earth. Ibidem. Ca. iii
And for yt is hard to escape at all times wtoute some negligence* therefore
our lord bad that at the end of each hour. he should say thus. Deus
prop^cius esto michi peccatori, that is. God be mercyful to me sinner. Or else
thus. O agne mitissime miserere me^. that is. O most mylde lamb have mercy
upon me. And if he forgette to say thus after each hour. at the least that he
say one of these prayers seven times each day when he has leyser. and think
thereon. For sithe this word. Deus propicius esto michi peccatori, was so
vaylable to the publycan. Luce. xviii.
that as our lord says. he gatte forgyuenes of all his sins* why should
yt not get to a another that says yt with meke and contryte heart
forgyuenesse of his negligence sith our lords mercy is as ready to man now. as
yt was then. Therefore while these prayers ar thus profitable. and therwt so
short me seems yt were a great dullness. not to will use them. Our lord
grant us ever to be true and dylygente in this holy service. Amen.

Here begins of your Feasts
FOr asmoche as your service is of our glorious Lady which ye departed in
seven stories. after the seven days of the wyke as is before said* therefore
ye have not many chaunges after the varyau^ce of feasts. and often times of the
year. as the common service of the church uses. But in diverse festes. and
times ye say some of the same seven stories dyuersely as is most acordynge
thereto. And thus in the feasts of the Co^cepcyon. and of the Natyuyte of our
lady. ye say the story of the wednesday. For in that story is made most
special mind of the same feasts. The same story is also said on saint
Annes day. For the holy concepcion. and birth of our lady. whereof is made
mind in that story. is great worship and praysynge to her mother Anne. of
whom she was conceived and borne in so great holiness. and clennesse. In the
feast of the Annunciacion of our lady and in all crystmasse time. And in ye
feast of Candelmas And in the feast of the Uysytacyon of our lady* ye say
the story of y^ Thursday* by cause that story makes most special mencio^ of
the Incarnacion of our lord Jesus christ. which is worshyped in holy church.
in tho feasts. In the feast of the assu^pcion. ye sing (...) of the
Saturday. for yt (...) all ther^o^ On Myhelmasday. ye say the stor^ of the
mo^day. For ye story tellyth what joy and love. angels had of our glorious
lady from her first making. From passion so^day till Esterne. ye say the
story of ye friday, for ye speaks most of our lords holy passion and of the
co^passyon of his most loving mother. Other dyu^rse chaunges ye have in these
feasts. and times. as your ordynal shows more plainly. And the causes of
such chaunges. ye may sone parceyue your self by the redynge of the same
things in english. For ye shall find that they have some conuenyence to the
feast or to the time that they are set to be song in. As in Penthecoste
weke. ye say this hympne. Veni creator spirit^s, At your hours. by cause yt
spekyth most of the holy ghost. that is worshyped in holy church that time.
And on the same wise ye say O, veneranda trinitas, In trynyte wyke. And so
furthe of other. But I write here only tho things that long specially. to
some of these feasts. and are not contained in any of the seven stories
before. And specially in four feasts of our lady. that is the Concepcyon.
the Natyuyte. the Puryfycacyon. and the Assumpcyon* ye have special and proper
chapiters and collectes. that are not written before. and therefore they show now
after.

In the Concepcion of our Lady. at Euensonge at matyns. and at Tyerce The
Chapyter.
DOminus posseditme The lord had me in the beginning of his works. ere then
he made enythynge. from the beginning. I am ordained from wythouten end. and
of old times. ere then the earth was made. This Chapyter is taken of holy
scripture. and so are nigh all the chapiters of your service. Prouerbi. viii.
And yt is expouned by doctoures of our lord jesus christ that is the
endelesse wisdom of the father. and says these words of himself. But here
yt is set to be understand of our lady. that was endelesly ordained of god
to be worthyest of all creatures. as ye may se more plainly in the Sunday
lessons. And so thereby ye may esyly understand the sentence of this chapyter.

The Oryson.
DEus qui beat. God that toldest before. the co^cepcion of the blyssed virgyn
mary. to her father and mother. by the foretellynge of the aungel* grant this
thy meyne to be defended by her prayers. whose holy solemnytyes of concepcion.
they worship. by according business. Per dominum nostrum,

At Sexte the Chapyter.
NEcdum erant abissi, Depnesse were not yet. and I was then conceived.
Prouerbi. viii.
wells of waters were not yet spronge up. mou^teynes were not yet set in
sad heaviness before hills. I was brought fourth. This is to mean. that
or any thing was made, our lady was fore ordained of god to be conceived. and
borne in time* and to be most worthy of all creatures.

At None. the Chapyter.
BEatus homo, The man is blyssed. that herith me. Prouerbi. viii.
by obedience. And he yt daily waketh at my gates. And wayteth at the entrye of
my door. by hasty and ready co^ynge to sing and read my service. He that
fyndeth me by grace. he fyndeth life everlasting. And he shall draw health
from the lord. For as water is drawn out of a well. so all health comes
from god. that is the spring well of all goodness.

In the Puryfycacyo^ of our lady. at all Euensonges. at mattyns and at Tyerce.
the Chapter.
ECce ego mitto, Lo I send mine au^gel. that shall make ready a way before my
face. ^alach. i^i.
And the lord that ye seek. shall sone come to his temple. And the au^gel of
ye testamente whom ye desire. Here in this Chapyter. both our lord jesus.
and saint John^ baptyste. are called angels. not in kind but in clennesse of
leuynge and in office. First saint John^ baptyste is called an au^gel. where
the prophet said of him iu the person of the father of heaven. many years or
saint John^ was borne, thus Ecce ego mitto angelum meum, Lo I send mine au^gel
qui proparabit viam ante faciem meam, that shall make ready a way before my
face^ that is before my son jesus which is called the face of the father. for
as a man is known by his face. so is the father known by the son. Before
this face. saint John^ made ready away for the prechyng and baptysynge of saint
John^ baptist was an enter and a way so the prechynge. and baptysyng of our
lord Jesus christ. Et statim veniet ad templu^ sanctum suu^ dominator quem vos
queritis, And the lord that ye seek shall come anon in his holy temple. This
was fulfilled in this holy feast. when our lady offered her blyssed son in
to the temple Et angelus testamenti, Luce. ^^.
And the au^gel of testamente. that is the new law of love written in the
apostels hearts by the holy ghost. Quem vos vultis, whom ye desire. for the
good people of the jews. ever sought and desired much the co^ynge of christ.

At Sexte the Chapyter.
EGo quasi vitis, Ecclesia. xxiiii.
I as a vine have fruited the swetnesse of smelle. And my flowers ar fruit of
worship. and of honest In this Chapyter. our lord is lykened to a vine. For
as a vine. the more yt stands in heat of the son. the more sweet is the
grape. or the wine that is the fruit thereof* right so our lady. for she was
most hot in love. and in grace of the holy ghost* therefore she brought
furthe the fruit of swetnesse. that is our lord Jesus christ. the fruit of
her womb. that is sweet to take in this world and in his sacraments. and
smells sweth in example of his holy co^uersacio^. But it is marvelous that
follows. when our lady says And my flowers are fruit. In all trees. and
herbs. the flowers go before. and the fruit co^eth after. And often there are
many mo flowers. then fruits. But all our blyssed ladies flowers. that is to
say her vertueus ^ were fruyteful. for no thing was lost. but all that she
thought. or said. or did. or left undone* all was intended to gods
worship. and to the profit of her even christian. And therefore yt follows. of
worship. that is to say to god. and of honest. that is to say to good example
of all other that se her. For by syghte of her. many were conforted and
edyfyed. and never none hurt.

love, agenste god. and his au^gel. and of dread. agenste al yuel spyrytes. And

Uasicedrus, I. am heyued as a cedre in lybane and as cypress in mount syon. I
am heyued as a palm in cades. and as the plauntynge of a rose in iherico. Here
is named four trees are these. Cedre. Cipresse. Palm. and a rosyer. Though
these trees grew in diverse places. yet in four places they were most
excellent in tho contrees. That is to say. she Cedre. in a mount that was
called lybane. And Cypress in the mon^te of Syon. And the palm tree, in a
place that was called Cades And the rose in iherico, Therefore by these four
trees. is understand our lady that was. and is. most excellent above al
creatures. The Cedre. is a tree that grows hye. and yt is so durable that yt
rotteth never. So our most reuerente lady. was hiest in verteu in earth. and
now is highest in bliss. And she never rotted. ne was corrupt in soul. by any
manner sin. ne in body. in her life. ne after her death. For the body with the
soul. is in endelesse bliss. And therefore she says. that she is hey ned as
a cedre in lybane. Cypress is a tree. that smells sweet. and the smelle
thereof dryueth a way serpents. and worms. yt is also so strong a tree. that
yt boweeh never what burden so ever be laid thereon. So our glorious vygyrn.
by the sweet smelle of her holy leuynge. and of her prayers. dryueth a way the
temptations of the serpents of hell. and the worms of yuel thoughts. from
them. that often by devout meditacion smelle so wardcher. She was also so
strong* y^ never prosperity might bow her to any manner vanyte. ne aduersyte.
to any vnpacyence. And therefore she is cypress in mount Syon. The palm tree.
is small byneth. and large above. and yt is ever grene. So our most
excellent lady was small byneth fro the love of all erthly things, and large
up ward by love and desire of heavenly things And therein she was ever grene.
for she was always full of virtues. without dryness of sin. or of defawlte.
And therefore she is as palm in cades. The rose grows amongst thorns. and
yet yt is in yt self most soft. yt conforteth also all the wits of man,
both syghte. smelling. touching. and tastynge. So our most sweet lady.
though she were borne among the jews. that were as thorns by malycyous
condycyons* yet she was clean from all their vices. and most soft. and
gracious in all virtues. whereby she conforted her lovers. in all their in ward
wits. And therefore she is called a rose in iherico.

might be had in earth of any creature^ she pass to the most hynesse of

is yt said here to her twyes Come from the lybane. Ones for the assu^pcyon of

olyue that growyth in gardyns. is several to the owners. but the olyue of the
fylde is common to all. Therefore our merciful Lady lykeneth herself rather to
the olyue of the fylde* for her pytye and mercy is always ready to all that will
call there to. in what degree soccur they be. The platane. or the plane tree.
has broad leaves. that is medcynable to hot yuels. whereby is understand the
broad and large charity of our blyssed lady that spredyth over all both good
and bad as long as they are in this life. For all good are comforted by her.
And there is none so wicked in earth. but that he has the less temptacion
for her sake. And be a man or woman never so deep in sin* if he will make him
self a broad and an open street by true shryfte. and power out water of very
contrycion* anon this plane tree that is our pyteful lady. will sprede over
him the leaves of her charity. and hele him from all brennynge temptacyon. and
syckenesse of sin. And therefore she is lykened to a platane tree by the water
in broad streets. Cynamome. is a spyce that is dry. and hot. and sweet
smelling. So our glorious lady was dry in body from all flesshely lust. by
dyscrete abstynence. and clean vyrgynyte. She was also hot in soul. by
^^ruente love to god. and charity. And she smelled sweet. both in soul. and
in body* by good examples bodily and gostly of holy conuersacyon. Bawlme is a
tree. and all that is therein. is virtuous and profitable. both. the self
tree. the fruit. and the lycour So our most reuerente lady is all full of
grace. and of verteu. Her holy body. that is vnderstonded by the bawlme tree.
was so worthy. that yt bare the son of god. And he is her blyssed fruit
most full of verteu. The branches of the bawlme tree whn they are cut. they
stylle most virtuous and sweet lyquore. Right so the branches of this tree
our lady. that are the holy members of our lord jesus christ. when they were
cut with cruel scourges. with hard nails. and with the sharp spear* they
stylled most precious and swetely coure to the health and redempcyon of
mankind. Myrre is a tree that grows five cubytes in length and the g^mme
thereof is bitter in taste. and sweet in smelle. By the five cubytes. is
vnderstonded the five joys of our lady that she had in earth. By the bitter
gomme. his bitter sorrows. but in this feast. all was turned to endeles
swetnesse that is understood by the sweet smelle. And therefore she says as
chosen myrre. I have given swetnesse (...).

In the Natyuyte of our Lady the Oryson.
HAmulis tuis, Lord we beseech the. part thou in to thy servants the gift
of heavenly grace. That. to whom the son borne of the blyssed vyrgyn mary was
begy^nynge of health* the desired solempnyte of her birth. mote give increase
of peace. Per eu^dem. By the same our lord jesus christ thy son. that lives
and rayneth god with the in unity of the holygoste without end. Amen.

Dani^lie iii.
BE Nedicite omnia opela domini domino, This hympne was made of three men. whom
the king of Babylone did cast in a great burning furneys offyre. that flamed
upon hye.xlix. cubits. by cause they would not worship an image by idolatrye
at his bidding. But an aungel of god came down and smote the flame of the
fire from tho three men. upon the kings servants that made the fire. which
were anon burnt all to ashes. But tho three men were nothing hurt of the
fire ne dyscesed. ne the least hear of their head burnt. And therefore they
brake out in praysynge of god. all with one voice and said. Benedicite omnia
opera domini, etc, These three men's names are written in the same hympne. in
the last verse save twain. One was called Ananye. a another Azarye. and the
third Mysael. This hympne ye sing in each feast of our lady. wherein ye
call all creatures of heaven. and of earth. of see. and of land. and of the
air above. to praise and to thank god. for the benefytes of grace and of
glory. that he has done and given to the glorious vyrgyn mary his holy
mother. And for each verse begins with blyssynge* ye shall understand that
god blessyth man. by geuynge of his gracious gyftes^ but man blesses god by
doing of praysynges. and of thankynges to god for his gifts. And also ioyenge
of his great bliss. and goodness. And so call ye all creatures to bliss
god in this hympne But unreasonable creatures. bless and praise god. in that.
that they do. as god has made them. and ordained them to do. And also they
are said to bliss god. in that. that man in beholdynge of them. is ^^urred to
bliss. and to praise god their maker. that so meruelously has made them.
They are also said to bliss god. when ma^^for whom all erthely creatures
were made. prayseth and blysseth god for the making. and for ye keeping of
them. and for all his works. when man calls angels to the praysyng^ of god.
yt is as much to say. that he ioyeth of the, joy that they have in the
praysynge of god and that he desires God endelesly to be praised for the.
making of angels to his everlasting praysynge. If all mankind had been
utterly loss. and never be boughte again. then had all creatures that were
made for man. be in manner lost. and the nombre of. angels not fulfilled by
man. And therefore sythman is boughte again by mean of our lady and so the
nombre of angels to be fulfilled. and all erthly creatures restored again in
manner to the worthynesse of effect that they were made for* yt is worthy that
man should call angels. and all creatures. and all the works of god to
praise him. and to bliss him. for that glorious lady. Therefore ye sing and
say. Benedicite omnia, All the works of the lord. bless ye the lord. praise
him. and enhaunse him up on hy with outen end. Pro honor, For worship. and
glory of the most worthy creature the vyrgyn Marye. mother of god. Benedicite
angeli, Angels of the lord. bliss ye the lord. heuens bliss ye the lord.

god. Benedicite aque, All waters that are above heuens. bliss ye the lord.
all virtues of the lord bliss ye the lord. for worship. and bliss of the
most worthy creature. the vyrgyn marye. mother of god. For as much as in this
verse is made mind of waters that are above heuens ye shall understand. that
there are seuentene heuens and ye syxteneth of these heuens. is called heaven of
waters and of crystal. Not for that. there are any waters* but for yt meue^h
as does waters. and yt is hard and clear as crystal. And this heaven is
called here in this hympne waters that are above heuens. For there are fourtene
heuens bynethe yt. toward the earth. And in your sequence on Sunday. yt is
called heaven of crystal. when ye say. Cristallinum v^iste^ latu^, etc, As
shall be said there more plainly. when we come thereto. with our lords
grace, Benedicite sol Son and moan bliss ye the lord. sterres of heaven
