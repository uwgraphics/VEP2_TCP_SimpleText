JEWS, By the grace of God, King of France and Navarre, To all men to whom
these presents shall come, greeting. If since the time that We were invested
with, and have undertaken the government of this State, We had failed in any
thing, either in regard of the Queen Our most honorable Lady and Mother, or
in respect of the Princes and noble Personages of Our Kingdom, We would with
more patience receive and bear the troubles which therein at this present are
stirred up and raised against Us. But calling to mind such accidents as are
formerly past, and considering what fruit the favors, graces, and benefits, by
Us so liberally imparted unto those, who at this day trouble Us: We cannot so
soon bewail Our hard fortune, as also that of all France in general, but We
must withal accuse and utterly condemn the small consideration of those, that
reward Us evil for good. For all men know, that presently upon Our acceptance
and entrance into the administration of public affairs, Our first care was to
deliver the Princes and great Persons of Our Realm from the oppression and
trouble wherein they were, and to speak truth, from utter ruin and
destruction, which then was like to fall upon them; and drew them near unto
Our person: and nothing but the emulation and iealousies that was then between
them, hindered them from being of Our Council, and privy to the conduction and
ordering of Our Princely affairs. Touching the Queen our most Princely Lady
and Mother, We gave and yielded unto her all that honor which the state of
things at that time might bear, and procured the means to make her enjoy all
contentments that she could wish or desire. After that when she had withdrawn
her self from Blois to Angoulesme, there to frame a public complaint, because
(as she said) she was hindered from the enjoying of Our presence, although for
Our own parts We were much offended at the behauiours of those that were her
assistants, and had power sufficient to punish their insolences, We were
content for her satisfaction to grant her all whatsoever she desired, the
Towns, Forts, and governments which she would choose, such money as she
required to have; and not only were pleased, that she should reside near
unto Us, but did so instantly seek it of her, that then at that time she came
to Us to Tours, with such and so great confidence, that We were wholly out of
doubt that nothing in subsequent time would alter her mind. We likewise, for
her sake, pardoned those that had aided and assisted her, and made diverse of
them Captains of Our guard, which before had abandoned Us to follow her. After
We had effected all that, which We had promised unto her, with long patience
We expected, but could not see those of her part perform that whereunto they
were bound: and yet for all that, We abstayned not from gratifying her in all
things that she desired and required at Our hands, not only in respect of her
self, but also of those that held with her; as also continually to cause
diverse great Personages and men of quality to visit her, and instantly
solicited her to come near unto Us, so far, that being advertised that
certain malicious spirits, made her believe, that Our desire therein was
clean contrary to the outward show We made: to give her more assurance both of
Our intent and the respect that We bear unto her, We set forward to meet her
in the middle way, at such time as she had promised to come; and are persuaded,
that if therein she had only been ruled by her self, and her own good
disposition, We should not have failed at this present of a great consolation,
and our Realm of an entire and assured tranquillity. But unmeasurable ambition
which provoke the spirits of many great Personages in Our Realm, that fill
their heads with discontentments, and makes them weary of ease and quietness,
has been the cause that disagreeing among themselves, touching their own
particular affairs, they have in general plotted together to effect some
novelties in the State: and to trouble Our Realm, upon and under the same
pretenses, which all those that formerly attempted the same have practiced. And
because they were persuaded that the person of Our said Lady and Mother in her
respect, might better cloak, disguise, and strengthen these disseings; there
is no manner of artificial practices wherewith they have not served their
turns, to put distrust into her breast, to alter her good intentions, and to
persuade her that she had wrong done unto her, if she had not an absolute
authority given her in Our Realm. And although the evil (which therein
makes Us too much feel her ouer-great facility) touches Us to the quick,
yet We hold her excuseable, being persuaded, that not many spirits in the
world are able to withstand and resist so many, continual, and damnable
inventions. And although We hear her name used in all places, and her
signature and seal even throughout all Our Provinces, to authorize that which
is pretended against Us, yet We cannot be persuaded but that her heart is
wholly alienated from the same, and her soul altogether innocent. But for
that, at the pursuit of the complaints that are made in her name throughout all
Our Realm, and of the protestations to reform Our State, We have seen Our
Cousin the Duke of Mayen withdraw himself from Our Court, without taking leave
of Us; the Duke de Vandosme Our natural brother follow after him, Our Cousin
the Duke de Longueville being sent for to come unto Us, refuses to do it; Our
Cousin the Duke de Nemours gone from Us in the nightime. And since that
(which most grieueth Us) Our dear and loving Cousin the Earl of Soissons, and
Our Cousin his mother, likewise gone from Our Court by night, then when We were
upon the point to honor him with the marriage of Our sister: Which also was
seconded by Our natural brother the great Prior of France; and soon after
were advertised that all of them were gone to Our said Lady and Mother,
together with the Dukes de Rets, de la Trimoville, de Rohan, and de Rohanois,
and the agents of the said Dukes de Mayen and Espernon, to take order to leuy
arms, and to give a beginning to the execution of their deseignes: We
understood, that as soon as they had seduced all Our Regiments, to put them
into Metz, they intended therewith to disarme all the inhabitants thereof. We
were presently informed of negotiations made with strangers, to cause them to
enter into Our Realm, that the greatest part of the Nobility of Our Provinces
are practiced withal, the soldiers seduced, provisions of arms and munitions
made, deseignes agreed upon to be put in practice against certain Towns, and
Forts, Our money taken and stayed in the Receipts of Xainctes, Saint John,
Fontenay, Angiers, Chinon, and other places: Commissions delivered out (whereof
some fell into Our hands) to leuy foot and horsemen, garrisons put into Our
Towns, Craon besieged and taken. And that which touched Us nearest of all,
was, to understand that Our Duchy of Normandy was like wholly to be lost,
whereby We perceived that Our good City of Paris would by that means be
brought to a miserable and pitiful estate. Preferring the good of Our Subjects
before Our own life, only taking Our Guard with Us, We went presently to
Roane, from whence the Duke de Longueville (abashed at Our resolution) withdrew
himself, and gave Us means to assure that town from the spoil, which
without doubt, it had endured, if We had not come thither; as it was publicly
declared unto Us by Our Court of Parliament in the same Town, at such time as
We there sat in the seat of Justice. After that, having within two days
reassured the state of that Town, and seized upon the old Palace, We went to
Caen, where We entered into the Castle, and made trenches close to the walls, in
such manner that those that were besieged within it, perceived themselves to
be out of all hope of any aid, and yet ceased not insolently to shoot at Us,
at such time as they knew that We were gone to visit the trenches: which
nevertheless, withdrew Us not from using mercy and clemency toward them, and
so much the rather, because they made their excuses, that they were commanded
by Our said Lady Mother, to hold the place strong against Us: always desiring
more and more to witness and show Our patience, and the respect that We had
unto her. Since that We reduced the Towns of Alencon, Vernevil, Dreux, and la
Ferte-Bernard, under Our obedience. And now, for that We understand that the
Army that is in the field, under the borrowed name of Our said Lady Mother,
has besieged and taken the Town of la Flesche, wherein the heart of Our late
most Princely Lord and Father is buried, and marches forward to besiege the
Town of Man's, We draw Our Army thither to deliver it from the siege which it
fears, and to withdraw the other out of the hands of insolent soldiers, who
having violated the fidelity which they owe unto Us, may well violate the
respect which they owe to the memory, and to the ashes of Our said Lord and
Father. But before We march forward, to employ Our just and necessary arms,
to suppress the audaciousnesse of those that have taken and bear arms
against Us, intruding upon Our authority, and seek to invade Our Provinces:
Our desire is, that every man should manifestly know and understand Our intent,
and make those that offend Us, see that the greatness of their faults (although
most extreme) cannot attain to the height of Our clemency, if they would have
recourse thereunto; and that neglecting the same, We will and pretend to make
them suffer and feel the rigor which the Laws and Ordinances of Our Realm
have decreed against them. Therefore, We make it known that after We had taken
order about these affairs, by the advice of Our Council, consisting of Our
most dear and only loving brother the Duke of Aniou, Our most dear and
beloved Cousin the Prince of Conde, first Prince of Our blood, together with
diverse Cardinals, Dukes, Peers, Officers of Our Crown, and principal Lords
of Our said Council; by their advice, We have decreed and signified, and by
these presents decree and signify, that touching the Queen Our said Lady and
Mother, We do not believe, neither can be persuaded, that she has forgotten
the amity and love which nature binds her to bear unto Us, and the memory
of Our said Lord and Father exacteth from her: and which We have sought to
deserve at her hands. And although it should fall out, that she should use
other comportments toward Us then she ought to do, We are determined with
religious patience to endure them, and that when Our Army approaches near unto
that which is assembled in her name, We will not employ Our forces to any other
end, then to deliver her out of the hands of those, who to the prejudice of Us
and our Realm, captiuate her spirits, and her will; and to withstand the
effecting of those desseignes which they have for the ruin of Our state.
Touching Our Cousin the Earl of Soissons, and Our Cousin the Countess his
Mother, the Dukes de Vandosme, the great Prior of France, the Dukes de
Longueville, de Nemours, de Mayen, d'Espernon, de Rets, de la Trimoville, de
Rohan, de Rohanois, the Marshall de Bois Dauphin, the Earl de Candale, the
Marquis de la Valette, the Archbishop of Tholose, and others the Officers of
Our Crown, We enjoin and most expressly command them, to leave off their
Arms, and to surcease from all acts of hostility against Our subjects; to
leave all leagues and confederacies, as well within as without Our Realms, and
within one month next after ensuing the Publication of these presents, to come
personally unto Us, thereby to give us more and better assurance: which doing,
We will remit all crimes and offenses by them done unto Us, in this last
commotion, promising to receive them again into Our favor, and give such
assurance thereof by writing, as they shall think necessary for the same:
likewise commanding all others that have taken their parts, and under the name
of Our said Lady and Mother have borne arms, and consequently, used acts of
hostility, or otherwise, that have made themselves culpable toward Us, that if
they withdraw themselves from the said arms, and before the nearest Judges
that shall be unto them, declare, that they willingly withdraw themselves from
the said party, league, and association, they shall be acquitted and discharged
by virtue of these presents, and never be troubled nor molested for the same:
and failing to do it, and to accept of this Our present pardon, within the
said time, which being once past, for the present as well as then, We have and
by these presents do declare all the said Princes, Dukes, Peers, and Officers
of Our Crown aforesaid, and others, of what quality, state, and condition
soever they be, which have directly or indirectly been participants in the
said associations, proceedings, practices, leuies, bearing of arms, and acts
aforesaid, mentioned, to be guilty of high treason, and perturbers of the
common peace and quietness of Our Realm, and thereby to have incurred the
forfeiture of all honors, governments, dignities, offices, benefices, seises,
lands, and Signiouries whatsoever they hold of Us, to be reunited to Our
Crown. And for the better declaration and execution of the pains imposed
upon, and set down against such crimes, by the Laws and Ordinances of Our
Realm, We will that all Our Judges shall proceed orderly against them and their
posterities, in every place, where the knowledge thereof is brought unto them.
And therefore command Our loving and faithful Counselors of Our Courts of
Parliament, Bailifes, Stewards, Judges, or their Lieutenants, and all others
Our Justices and Officers, to whom particularly it shall or may appertain, to
cause these Our present Letters of Declaration to be read, published, and
registered, and from point to point exactly to execute, keep, and inuiolably
observe the same, according to the tenor and form thereof, charging Our
Attourneyes general and their Substitutes, to make all pursuites, and to use
all diligence therein according to the tenor of their Offices, for such is Our
pleasure: In witness whereof, We have caused Our Seal to be set to these
presents. Given at Mertaigny the 28. of July, Anno 1620. and of Our reign the
11.
