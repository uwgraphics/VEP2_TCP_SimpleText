A Pair of Turtle Doves, Or,
A dainty new Scotch Dialogue between a Yong-man and his Mistress, both
correspondent in affection, etc.

To a pretty pleasant tune, called the absence of my Mistress, or I live not
where I love.


Yong-man. MVst the absence of my Mistress
gar me be thus discontent,
As thus to leave me in distress,
and with languor to lament:
Nothing earthly shall divorce me
from my dearest, but disdain,
Nor no fortune shall enforce me,
from my fairest to refrain.
O my dearest,
My heart nearest:
When shall I so happy be
To embrace thee,
And to place thee,
Where thou nere may part from me.

Maid. Since my absence does so grieve thee,
it does wound me to the heart:
If my presence could relieve thee,
I would play a loyal part:
But I prithee be contented,
since the Fates will have it so,
Though our meeting be prevented,
thou my constancy shall know.
O my sweetest,
The compleatest
Man alive in my conceit,
Lady Fortune
I Will importune,
Soon to make our Joys complete.

Yong-man. Since thy absence does conjure me
with perplexity and pain,
What would thy presence then allure me,
for to see thee once again:
As thy absence sends such sadness
that it scarcely can be told:
So thy presence yields gladness,
to all eyes that thee behold.
O my dearest, etc.

Maid. What reward then shall I render,
to him that me does so respect,
But my constancy to tender,
With like favor to effect:
And since thy love to me is fervent,
so my heart shall be to thee,
And as thou prou'st my loyal servant,
thy true Mistress I will be,
O my sweetest,
The compleatest
Man alive in my conceit,
Lady Fortune
I Will importune,
Soon to make our Joys complate.

Yong-man. Then my Love, my Dove, my fairest,
since I may repose such trust,
In my heart thou only sharest,
none else crave a portion must:
Thou have settled thy affection
upon me and none beside,
And I of thee have made election,
thou alone shall be my Bride.
Come my dearest,
My heart nearest,
When shall I so happy be,
To embrace thee,
And to place thee,
Where thou nere may part from me.

Maid. My hearts Joy, more sweet than honey,
or the odoriferous rose,
I have laid such hold upon thee,
as the world can nere unloose
The Gordian knot, which though as yet
is not by Hymen tied fast,
Yet Heaven knows my heart is set
on thee my choice, while breath does last.
Come my sweetest, etc.

The second part
To the same tune.


Young Man. When Hyperion does for ever
from the Sky obscure his rays,
When bright Luna (constant never)
leaves to sever nights from days:
When the Sea does cease from running,
when all thus change preposterously,
Then that firm vow which I once made,
(and not till then) I Will break with thee.
Come my dearest,
My heart nearest,
When shall I so happy be,
To embrace thee,
And to place thee,
Where thou nere may part from me.

Maid. When rich mizers throw their money
in the streets, and hoord up stones,
When my Fathers Nagge so bonny,
leaves good hay to pick dry bones:
And when the dog conform to that,
does change his food for Oats and hay,
Then shall my oath be out of dale,
or else last till my dying day.
Come my sweetest,
The compleatest
Man alive in my conceit,
Lady Fortune,
I Will importune,
Soon to make our joys complete.

Young Man. When the Bucke, the Hare, or Cony
do pursue the Dog to death,
When a rock so hard and stony,
can dissolved be with man's breath:
When furtles make a second choosing,
then will I a new Love seek,
Till then all but thee refusing,
though I might change every week.
Come my dearest, etc.

Maid. When both toads, with snakes and adders,
breed upon the Irish ground,
When men scale the Sky with Ladders,
when two Phoenixes are found:
When the Goose the For does follow,
or seek to hunt him forth his den,
Or swine in dirt refuse to wallow,
I Will not forsake my love till then.
Come my sweetest, etc.

Young Man. Then sweet Love since both agree thus,
having hearts reciprocal,
Long I hope we shall not be thus
barred from the principal
Of all our joy, which is blessed marriage,
Hymen haste to knit the knot,
In The mean time our constant carriage,
will in the world nere be forgot.
Come my dearest,
My heart nearest,
When shall I so happy be,
To embrace thee*
And to place thee,
Where thou nere may part from me.
