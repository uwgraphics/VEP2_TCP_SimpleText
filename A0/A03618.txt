An Answer unto my lord of wynchesters book intytlyd a detection of the deuyls
Sophistrye wherewith he robbith the vnlernyd people of the true byleef in the
most blessed sacrament of the altar made by Iohann Hoper.

Psalm. 119. Vestigia mea dirige in uerbo tuo domine, and and non dominabitur
mei ulla iniquitas,

Pryntyd in Zurych by Augustyne Fries. Anno M. D. XLVII.

Johan Hoper wyshythe grace and the yefftes of the holy Gooste unto my lord of
wynchester.
Your book my lord intytlid a detection of the deuilles Sophistry etc. Was
delyueryd unto me in Zurych the xxx. of Aprell, last past: the which I have
with leisure and diligence perusid, Markyd your intencion, and how ye sense a
wrong opinion with many ffere words and diverse reasones, sufficient to
confirm the ignorant in his ignorancie, to stablyshe his error, and likewyce
it may put in danger the good and sim ple conscience unlernid that is perswadid
and seythe the truithe, yet for lack of knolege cannot, nor is not able to
defend the same, when arguments subtille and crauffti shall assault his simple
and plain ffaythe above the reche and capacite of his intendemente Therefore
Because Idesire souche as know the trewthe to persevere in the same, and souche
as yet be ignorant thereof to comme unto the trewithe that in Christ they might
with the church of truithe ffind eternal salvation. I have made this answer
unto your book to succur and warrant the conscience of the reader, ffrom the
snares and sophisticacions wherwithe all you or any other should troble and
unquiete the peace and tranquillite of him that restyth only under the shadow
and protection of gods holy word, being deliuerid ffrom the darkenys of
Egypt, the detestable doctrine of man. I have likewyce dedicatyd the same unto
your lordshyppe to declare that it is against your cause and opinion that I
writ and not against you, to whom I wyshe the same grace and ffauour of god,
that I would unto my self, and the love that Paul wyshid unto his contre men
the Jews of who ssaluacion he was most desyrows, thowghe there obstinacy and
blindenis so meritid the punishment and seuerite of gods Ire, that he was
compellyd to wryt the indictment and condemnacion of there infidelite as it
aperithe by his most loving and affectionat heart To. 9. before his enter into
that lamentable and severe disputacion of there departure and reiection ffrom
the promise of god. Taking god and his conscience to record that he wrote of no
Malice, nor pretensid isle will, but constraynid there unto to serve the glory
of god and the truithe of his word: Which must be preferrid before all other
loves of the worold. Therefore wrote he as I do in the defense of the uerite to
gaynesouche as he wrote unto untogod, and to defend them that knew the truithe
ffrom the subtlety and crauffte of souche as pretended, the subversion of the
truithe by crafftye and subtle argume^tacion. It is not ignorant unto you
what may be done by the uerteue of a fere and well orderyd oracion. How mouche
it auaylythe whether it persuade a trewthe or a falsite. No need to syke
examples thereof in Demosthenes Cicero or any other profane writer the
scripture is plain that it has souche uehemency and effect in it self with
the help of the devil, that it persuadithe the falsyst lie of the worold to
be true, make the man to belyue not only that godd is isle, the treuthe
falshod, but that god, his word, and all that speaky the his word befalse, as
we may se, Nu. 13. by the oracyon of those 10. that were sent by the church of
the Israelites with Iehosua and Caleb to inquire and sarche the condicione and
nature of the land of coenaan: at there Return as treatoures of the commune
wealth, and not as faith full inquisitoures as it was commaundid them in
there embassayge and commission made this oracion and aduertisme^t of there
expedicion: Venimus ad terram ad quam nos misisti, and utique fluit lacte and
melle, and hicest fructus eius. Nisi quod populus est fortis qui habitat in
terra, and civitates munite and grandes ualde: quin and filios Anac uidimus
ibi. Amalec autem habitatin terra meridionali etc. This bryue oracion so
preualyd among the Israelitis, that it browght the hole multitude and
congregation of the church into desperacion into a contempt of god and there
lawful apoyntid Emperor Moses, And high prist Aron. Confer theffect of this
oracion which ye may see in the beginning of the xiiij. chapter of Number. with
god and all the miracles that ever he wrowght for them, and yet more aualyd
this false oration to persuade a false effect, then god, his word, Moses, or
Aron. God Among all the people of the worold, Chose this people to be peculier
unto him self and bid Moses say unto Pharo that he should dimisse his people to
do sacrifice unto him Exodus ^. This singular favor and priuilayge aualyd
nothing, they would return into Egypt Number. 14. again and serve Pha rao there
mortal Ennymie and leave the living god. He that deuidid the red see, kyllid
all the ffyrst begoten of Egypt Exodus 12. fed them with mete from heaven:
Wonderfully preseruid boothe there ffathers and them of his merciful favor
promisid them not (...) lyffe eternal, but also a pleasant, rich and most
commodious realm, and kyngdon, in this worold. Now has this ffalse oracion
of the 10. treatures wrowght souche an opinion in there heddes that they deny
god, and has no more trust nor confidence in him, nor will not hyre him
spoken of: in so mouche that all the hole congregation agreyd to stone Iehosua
and Caleb to death because they contraryd there wicked pretense: yet was it
not the ffere of stones, ffyre, another swerd that could fere these too godly
men ffrom preaching the truth of god: they had words against words, and an
oracion against an oracion and said if it pleace the lord he can bring us into
this land, and trewly because he has promysid it, unto us, he will give it,
be not ye Rebellious against him. Nether fere ye not the people of the land,
they shall be our bread we shall deuore the^ for zilam there protection is
departid from them. And the lord is with us. Little a uaylyd this godly oration
it persuadyd nothing at all, yet did these too there dewtys to show the
truythe: which is an Example that we should do the same, all ways confess the
the truythe, and defend the word of god, thowghe there belitle hope, or none
that it shall take effectt, yet it is our dewtys whether we be lernyd or
unlernyd every man to confess his faith, for he that says in thy heart thou
shall have no more Gods but one, the same god says thou shall not take my
name in uayne, Exo. 20. and in forbyddyng the negatyue, he commaundythe the
affyrmatiue it is not sufficient to refrain the tongue ffrom swering and speking
of isle, but that it must confess the treuth of god and speak well, as David
says declina a malo and fac bonum. It is not sufficient to leave isle undon,
but that we must do the godd commaundid by god and his law. As David says
Psalm. 1. blessid is he that walkythe not in the concell of the isle etc. but
has his meditacions in the law of god day and night. Wyste I that my labor
should never do good, ner healpe the conscience of one manne: yet for the
commandments sake would I have wroten, to set one oracion against the other,
because I se the Name of god blasphemid by the opinion that ye defend. But I
have hope that it shall somewhat avail to confound the falshode, and bring the
truithe the sooner to light. I know it is the condition of god to permit unto
every oracion his nature and condition, as we se some times by preaching of the
true word of god people ar conuertyd unto faith, some time, by preaching the
doctrine of men people ar seducid and caryd ffrom the faith. It is not the
nature of god to make the false orator domme when he would persuade a false
opinion, Nether to make his auditors deffe, but as Isay he suffrethe the
oracion to work his uertewe, and leauithe ffre election unto the audience to
embrace which part they list, by grace, and a consenting will, the good, by
the devil and there own malice the isle. Now the orator of god must persuade
with none othere arguments or words then the master of the scole Christ
has tawght. The Prophets and aposteles wrote^: It is no orator of Christ's,
that contrary unto his Canones, Rules and precepts, would persuade in the
church any thing more the^ is prescribid in the sccipture the which is most
perfete and sufficient to persuade in causes of Religion all things. That law
must needs be most perfete, that can have nothing addid unto it, nor nothing
taken from it, of this condition is the scripture as ye know by the words of
Moses and the reuelacion of Johan. Luc. in his later book says: Superiore
uolumine diximus Theophile, de omnibus quae cepit Jesus facere and docere. The
which words Joan. Chrysostom. thus interpretith, de omnibus, and non omnia: de
omnibus ad salutem necessarijs. Consernyng doctrine and how to lead our liffe
it is sufficiently tawght in the scripture. Those that will stablishe the Mass
as ye do my lord and defend Idolatrye: Must prove the thing ye speak by the
scripture, and plainly satisfy the places of the scripture browgte against
you. ye must not darken the places with gloses of your ymagyon. But dissolve
the places and content boothe the scripture which is your mortal Ennymie in
this matter, and likewyce satisfye the reason of man which ye neglect in this
cause of the sacrament other wyshe then ye should do, and for a good reason ye
bring an invisible miracle. God that can resuscitat the Children of Abraham out
of the hard stones, send you of his merciful grace, to take away the uele of
blyndenys and give you his light, Amen.

IT IS DAILY PRAYDE IN THE CHVRche of god, good Christian reader of as many as
knowith and felith in them selfs there weakenys, how soon man is Caryd away,
either with affections, either by forse of temptacion (which, the nature of man
corruptyd in no wise (can resist) unto all Kind of abhominacion. that god of
his mercy would defend, those dangerouse assaults of the devil, the worold,
the flesh and sin and says Ne inducas nos in tentationem: suffer not us to
be over come with temptacion, nor caryd away by the forse of the dewyl, into
the danger of sin and iniquite. but deliver us from isle. govern us with the
ligth of thine eternal truythe. that nether by ignoraynce of knolege of thy
most holy word. nether by thymbecillite ant weakenys of our infirm nature,
we fall not away from the. Great and wonuderfull was the prudens of David. yet
was he diverse times Caryd away, into manny great sins, and so for the time
made servant unto the devil and his own lusts, that with great difficultye,
and inspekable penitence skarse could he in long time affter, moderat those
wilful and rayshe affectyons. so dangerous a thing is it to be servant unto
the devil who would have all men created, unto the similitude of god, and
redemyd with the most precious blud of his only son, to be theternall
uesselles of gods ire and uengens as he is himself. Ando to bring this wykyd
purpose to pass he usithe not one simple and plain way but a thousand
crafftye, and false subtiltes as he seithe occation promptyng to every mannys
nature and inclynation, the sin that he is most prone and dysposyd unto and
leauyth not the man that he assaultithe, until souche time as he opttyne the
uictorye. Except the wrechyd man keep himself with dread and fere, under the
protectyon of gods mercy and desire him with ardent, uehement and daily
prayer, that in Christ he may resist the forse of his mortal ennymy, who is
final pretense is none other then to beryue the soul of man of the ioyse
eternal, and to have hyme his companyon for ever, to course the living god and
to blaspheme his holy name without end, but these temtations in Christ we may
over come, he came into the worold to destroy the works of the devil, 1.
Joan. 2. and no man may better over come the devil, then he that is well
perswadyd of his malycyous and insaciable ire toward god and man, knowith and
felyth in himself that he is mortal ennymy booth unto god and unto all his
most perfet works, ready allways to pervert gods order in all thyngis. as we
may to our pain perceive in our selfs, the soul that was, created unto the
similitude of god, replynyshyd with all uertewe and grace, full of knolege
prudence, and undrestondyng, in all thyngys appertaynyng unto god, a heart most
gentle, humble, and always obedyent unto god and godlynys, a will most ready
and prompt to imbrase, chose, and elect, the thyngis godly, and eschew refuse
and avoid what so ever god and reason iudgyd to be isle, but now it is
contrary, for knolege, ignorancy, for light darkenys, for obedience, contumacy
and rebellyon of heart boothe against god and his word, and for a will that
would be inclynyd and chose nothing but uertewe. and souch thyngis as might
most appertain unto the glory of god, a will that now chosith nothing less,
then toserue god and rather to blaspheme god, then to refuse thyle offryd by
the devil contrary unto god. thus is man spoylyd of all his orygnnall riches,
daily woundyd more and more wounds, fresh, and new, now percid with this
syne now with that sins, and yet lik unto men of no senses, we fyle, nether
perceive, how, nether when we are woundyd, nether care to syke a remedy of this
isle, thowgh right well we know, that every syne that man committyth, of
justice deseruythe eternal damnation, but these thyngz mouyth nothing at all,
the man that is ignorant what the devil, the worold and sin is, he felyth
nether what his dyseace is, nether knowith the craufft, malice, and deceyte of
his Ennymy, and by those means, departithe not only from god but also from all
honesty, and fallith, he knowith not how into souche detestable crimes, and
ignorancye of god, that booth god the worold and there own conscience baryth
testimonye of there iniquite against them. these our infyrmytes and great
offensis we must lern to know, and ons known, diligently study to amend them,
and to remove the causes of these yles, then the effect is sone destroyde. the
way to remedy all this isle and to lead an upright and honest lyffe is to know
god by his true an holy word who ledyth a man unto uertew only and so lie, as
dauyd teachyth Psalm. 119. quo pacto adolescens uitam inculpatam aget? nempe si
eam custodiat, ut dictat uerbum tuum, qum autem te queram in toto cord meo, ne
sinas me errare a mandatis tuis, who so ever conform his lief unto the word of
god, shall be out of the danger of his ennymye the devil, thowghe he be subject
unto thinfirmytes of the flesh and must suffer the temptacyons there of yet
shall he not be over com, but in christ able to resyst yea and to be delyueryd
from death, sin and the devil. as all godly men before our time has don
and lykwyce lefft behynd them in writing how we may do the sam, Saynct Paul,
that kew boothe the thowghtz of the devil 2. Corint. 2. and also. his apert and
open malyceagaynst those churches that he had prechid the gospel of Christ unto
among other he teachyth the Church of the galathyans that the principal remedy
against sin, is to belyue steadfastly the gospel of Christ, that he preachyd
unto them and not to admyt any false doctrine, or other learning thowgh an
angel from heaven should preach the contrary. Gal. 1. not to admyt any false
addycyon or dream of man. but be co^tentyd to use the same, as he lefft it.
Rebukyd wonderfully, souche audacious persons, as took upon them to set oni
gloss, or interpretacion, other then he had preachyd unto them. Thus tawght
Moses the Children of Israel. and bid them observe the law as it was yeuyn from
god and threatenyd the transtrangressours, and those that addyd unto the law,
the dyspleasure of gods ire which should cause all men to tremble and quak for
fere as many times as the thynkyth readyth. or hearyth readen any part of the
holy strypture because the reseaue it not with more reverence and honor with
hearty prayer that god will preserve them, from all false. sinister and preuerse
interpretations thereof, and with all study and dylygens. to follow and practyse,
waht so ever be commandyd them to do by gods word, in godly and uerteues
living for the law was not yeuen to be wroten in perschement or paper but in
the heart of man not to babble and prate of it, but to live as it byddyth. not to
bare it in the bosom but to show it unto the worold in godly conuersacyon and
uertues lief. To mark al thyngz therein conteynid, and to think uerely that all
togather is spoken to the, and that god requyryth that honesty and godlynys of
lief in the that there is expressyd, and would the to be ware how thou
transgres. his law and to avoid his importable dyspleasure, by texample of
other. for as god lettyd not. to puuyshe the transgression of our fore
fathers, he is the same god stylle and will do the like unto the, if thou
commit like offense. Remember that thorygynall of man's mysery condemnacyon
and death was first wrowght by the false interpretacion of the scripture, as
thou may se by te horible and most fear full example of adames wicked and
detestable transgression. which made all his posterite and succession,
prisoners eternally unto death, hell and sin, and compellyd by the same
means the son of the ethernall god to sustain thyncarnacyon of mortal
flesh to apeace thyre of god for man's transgressyon, that by the means and
death of his most innocent body he might d^ryue in to himself thole
dyspleasure and ucngence of man's transgression were there no more strypture
but that, that descrybyth the fall of man and the means how he was loost, it
were sufficient to teach all the worold to be war^ how to tak the word of god
in awrong sense, y^ adame had been contentyd to have usyd the word of god as it
was yeuen unto him, those myse rys had never be known ne^her by him nether by
his post^ryte, bu^ he wreacchyd man, forgote god and god lynis, yea and yke his
own wealth, left the text and belyuid the gloss, as the devil had tawght
eve which wrowgh^ his woo and pain, and where as he would not for the love of
god belyue the text of gods mouth the pains that ^olowid his transgression,
tawght him to know that the gloss was diabolycall, ^hus being instructyd let us
beware of gloses and false interpretations, and in all matters of contrauersie
and causes of religyon, belyue noman except he speak the word of god, trewly
and in the same sense that god meant it for as paul says wear ffoundyd upon
the fundacion of the prophets and the Apostoles the cheiffe corner stone being
Christ Ephesians. 2. and let us not dout but only the scripture is sufficien^ to
theache us all uerite and treuth consernyng rellygyon and to govern our lief in
all godly and honest conversation, and by the scripture we may cum alone unto
all perfection. Confute all her^sis and false doctrine thowgh there had never
doctor wroten ne never decre made by any general council as paul teachyth 2.
Timo. 3. 2. Pet. 1. therefore Christian reader as thou hopist tobe sauid
harken diligently unto the worcester des of our heneuly father, and here them not
only, but undrestond them, belyue them, and do them, his words be these. Matt.
17. Hi^ est filius meus dilectus, in quo m^hi complacitum est, ipsum audit^^ a
few words but a great matter conteynid in them, thonly salvation of all our
health, sufficient autoryte to over strew all false doctrine and all
Idololatrye of the worold. He that teachyth any thing that Christ tawght not,
is not tobe hard, souche as only has there redemption in thonly death of
Christ^ will be live nothing but that Christ commaundith, nor do any work that
cannot be aprouyd by the scripture. He holdyth always, this texct before his
y^ys. That the father showed unto the worold sayng this is my son, in whom I
delyt and does also with reverence and honor inbrace and receive his
commanudement which is, ipsum audite, hyre him. Now let us with the healpe of
his holy spryt, se whether Christ, ever tawght this doctrine, that in the
sacrament of his holy supper he meant any alteracyon or transubstanciacion of
the bread into his uery natural body and the win into his ue^y natural
blud, as my lord of wynchester teachyth in h^s book, or not. Or whether ^ith
his gloriouse body was ascendyd into heavens, heaven, herth, man, and Angel,
baryng recod thereof without cries and admiracion Viri Galil^^i, quid
admiramini, aspicientes in coelum, hic ^e sus, qui assumptus est a uobis in
coelu^, etc. Act. 1. Mark the manner, of his uisible, and corporal, ascencyon,
and belyue the scripture, thangellis an holy Apostoles y^ys that saw him body
ly ascend, and these words, Sic ue niet etc. better then this new massers,
whether it be possible that the seade of Abraam the ^rute an yssew of the belly
of that g^o^yous uirgyne mary being in all things (except sin) as
consubstancyall, equal, and like unto the nature of hismother, and nothing
dysferyng from the son of Adame, consernyng his humanyte Ebre 2. as in his
godhed is aegall and like in all things unto the father eternal, that has
nether begynnyngner endyng. Can be or may be against the nature of atrew body.
Present bodily, at the commanudement of every pryst when he speakyth these
words Hoc est corpus meum. which thing is as possible tobe done by aword, as
to make an end of the worold, when he would. for when so ever his gloryons body
shall descend from above, thend is come act 1. Matthew. 24. until that day
Christian reder look not for hyme but belyue thy creed and what so ever thou
heryst spoken by those isle persons of the new lernyng that it schuld be
present corporally in ^he mass which is but a yesterdayes byrd, trust thou to
the hold lernyng, of gods word, Sedet ad dextram dei patris, inde uenturus est
iudicare uiuos and mortuos, Act. 1. 7. 1. Joan. 2. belyue Christ's body to be
really and corporally in the sacrament when tho seist him there with thy
corporal yeies and not before. for Christ has no body invisible, nor
insensible as men dream, but auery true and natural mannys body like unto
mortal man, exceptsynne and now likewyce a glorified body, immortal as our
shall be in time tocum, and as many places of the new t^ stament prouyth Christ's
humanyte, as prouyth his deyte and more and as the word attributyth unto the
one nature dyuine all qualites, condicyons and propertyes appertayning unto the
godhed, so of tho^her part, it more manisestith, openyth and declaryth his
humany ^e, to be anature of other contrary qualites and condycyons, For a
smouch as god dyffyrith from man, so far does the one nature in Christ differ
from the other and as I must belyue, that these words betrewe in all things
co^sernyng the godhed of Christ, deus erat u^rbum. Lik unto god and uery god.
So must Ibelyue, this uerbum caro factum est Joan. 1. Christ to be in all
thyngzlike unto man, and uery true man in all things except sin. And as the
scripture prouyth these too natures to be unit and knyt in one person, and that
god and man ne is but one Christ. So prouyth it like wyce the qualytes of the one
nature to be contrary unto the qualites of the other nature, the one mortal,
the other immortal, the one tobe buryd in the sepulcher, the other to resustytat
the insensible and ded body 27. 29. Mar. 15. Lu, 23. Joan. 19. the one nature
uisible to be taken aster xl. days of his resurrexcyon from thearth into
heavens Mark 16. Act. the other nature invisible to contynew with his electis in
^e church until the woroldis end Matt. 28. he that kno with thus by the
scripture that the one nature of Christ uery man is taken out of the worold. And
shall not be in the worold till the great day of judgment Act. 3. Can not be
persuadyd. Contrary unto the word of god. That the same body maybe naturrally
and corporally under the form of bread. But will diligently incase the
scripture seem by words to prove the same, sarch how that place may be agreyd
wy ^hother, that manysestly repugnith the presens of Christ's body. And so agree
them that no co^traryete may be admittyd in the scripture for if one place be
false there is none true which were ablasphemy to say. The prophet David thus
commendyth the scripture Psalm. 19. Lex domini perfecta, conuertens animas,
testimonium domini uerum, imperitis sapi^ntiam suppedita^s. Decreta domini
recta sunt, cor exhilarancia, praeceptum domini repurgatum, illuminans oculos.
Therefore there must be as good head y^uento the meaning of the words. As unto
the words, or else they illuminat not, the conscience, but rather darken the
co^sciens and led it, into all false doctrine and detestable heresis. As we may
se hyre in those words of the lords supper: Hoc est cotpus meum, Matt. 26,
leauyng Christ's meaning plain, and constrayng the letter, forsyng it to serve
awyckyd purpose, men would make the people belyue that these words consecratyd
the bread into the naturalle body of Christ, and tellyth the people that
thowghe it repung never so mouch unto reason, yet it repugnyth not unto faith
which belyuyth every thing against reason. Christ says they, spak these words
and made his body of the bread, and bid us do the same. ^o these bethey
wherewith all this alteracyon of bread is made the substannce thereof turnyd into
the substaynce of Christis body: Hoc est corpus meum, dispute not how, belyue
the words and leave reason sai with the blessid uirgine: Ecceancilla domini Luce
1. she held here self contentyd, when she knew by the word of god that by
divine operacion of the holy ghost she should be the mother of gods only sone,
she stayed hereselfe by faith in the promese, and committyd the means and
doing thereof unto god, so say they ye must hold captyue all your reason and
thynk that god is able to do it, belyue, and it sufficyth. Godis able to do all
things, as in dead he can, and all these words be true that they persuade the
people withal, if they were placyd aryght. And applied to prove a true
conclusion as they be alegyd to stablyshe afalse and detestable heresy god
could have yeuen manne wings to fly as he gave unto the birds of thayre if
he would. But he would not, therefore he could not. Quia omnia quecunque
uoluit, f^cit in coelo and in terra. And as for the literal senses of these
words, Hoc est corpus meum, which they say must be undrestond with out any
trope or figure prouy the nothing. Christ callid himself adore Joan. 10. auyne
Joan. 15. and yet was nether door nor uyne except ye undrestond by adore the
only gate into heaven, and by the uyne the lycure of grace that confortithe
every troblyd conscience and que n^ith thyre and displeasure of god the father
against us for our sins. So like wyce in these words, Hoc est corpus meum,
there is none other thing to be understond by them, but that bread representyd
unto his apostelles, not only his precions body. But also the manner how, and
wherefore it should be torn and rent upon the cross and as they them selfs
brak the bread between, them so were they the cause that Chrystys body was
broken, and slain upon the cross, and that by the means, and use of this
sacrament theremight be always in the church of Christ a token of gods mercy
toward us, an a remembrans of that glorious body that su^tenyd most uyle
death for the sin of the worold. How be it the bread was no more the body, ner
the win his blud, then Christ was a lame as Joan called him. Ecce agnus dei
qui tollit peccata mu^di Ioa. 1. so thowgh he said the wine was his blud, and
the bread his body, he meant none other wyce, but that it representyd his body,
and he that corporrally with true repentence did eat of that corporal bread
and corporal win, in faith did eat spiritually Christ's body and bludd, and
if thou confer Matthe and Mark. with Luke and Paul. Thou shall find that these
words cannot be so grossly taken as men say, withont trope or figure. where as
Mat says 26. and Mark 14. Et accepto poculo grati^s actis, dedit illis
dice^s: Bibite ex eo omnes. Hic est en^m sanguis meus, qui est noui testamenti,
qui pro multis effunditur in remissionem peccatorum. Luke and Paul sayt 22. 1.
Cor. 11. Hoc poculum nouum testamentum est in meo sanguine. Here Luke and Paul
says playnli that the cup was the new testament, and attributith the same to
the cup, that Mattheu and and Mark attributithe unto the win. And says
that the cup and not the wine conteynid in the cup is the new testament in
the bludd of Christ. Which was to be shed for the sins of the worold. These
words of Luke and Paul they will understond by a figure. And let the letter
pass what auctorite have they to use thelpe and ayede of a trope in these
words of Luke and Paul. Where as they say plaineli Hoc poculu^ est
testamentum nouum in meo sanguine. And exponud (est) in this plae per
Metonymiam. And that Christ meant not that the cupp was the new testament, but
the wine contaynid i^ the cup. Of equite and right if they can take souche
lycens to expound those texctes that makith against them. They must be
conte^tid that other men use them likewyce, as mani times as necessite
requirith, by contrariete of textes. Or when without thayed of a trope we
cannot save our faith inuiolatyd. But it may fortune. They will say that Luk
and Paul must be undrestond, by Matthew and Mark. Wherefore not rather, Matt
and Mark, by the words of Luk and Paul for asmouch as they do more manifestly
declare the supper of the lord then Matt and Mark. And likwyce there words
better agreyth with the nature and propriete of a sacrament and rerum natura
quae in sacramento representatur then the words of Matt and Mark. Mark the
word of Luk and Paul and thou shall perceive plainly that this pronowne hoc,
cannot be referrid unto the cup only but unto all thaction of the hole supper
wherein the lord institutyd aperpetuall memori and sacrament of his glorious
passion and death. But incase this pronowne hoc could be referryd un to the
bread and wine as it cannot yet can nomam expond these words of the supper
without atrope, for theris more difficultye in this uerb est, then in the
pronowne Hoc. Forincase when Christ said unto his dystyples. This is my body
delyueryng them the bread. It was indeade as Christ said his body before he
called yt so. For every thing is called by his propere name. After that it
has his being and not before. The lygt was not called the day, nether the
darkness night. Until souche time as god had mad the son and the moon and
appoyntyd each of them there propre officyce Genesis 1. and the son of god was
not called the son of of man until souch time. A^ he receauyd the nature of
man in the belly of the blissid uirgine wherefore if this uerb est in these
words of the lords supper must neadys be simply and plainly reserryd. Unto
the bread and wine of the sacrament the bread and the wine was the body and
blud of Christ before Christ called it so, his body and blud, and before he
speak the se words that they call words of consecracion, Hoc est corpus
meum, when then began these external signs of br^ad and win, that he gave
unto his discyples tobe his body and blud. And what were the words that
alteryd the substaynce of bread and wine, Into the substannce of his most
precious body and bludd. It was not this uerbe (est) that did it, for if it
had not been his body before he called it so, Christ would never have named it
so. For he can not lie, he usith not to mysname any thing. He leuyth fraud and
false inuentyd terms unto the devil and souch as mean no godd faith by
there words. Now if it were his body. Very flesh, blud and bones in dead
what words of the scripture, or what words usyd Christ to make this
alteracion. Perauenture he whisselyd some othere words, and put apeace of
bread in his slyffe an there secreatly consecratyd his precious body, and then
said takeye eat ye for this is my body and so says some of these new papyshe
church where before transubstanciation of bread was never spoken of the mother
of this Idolatrye was Rome and the father unknowen. Abaster is this
transubstancion doutles. Lan francus that ennymi^ of truith and true religion
that wrote against Berengarius. Paschasius, Guymundus, Guydo Aretinus, Algerus
monachus Corbeiensis, Adelmannus Episcopus, Hugo, and his recentiores
Lombertus. Comestor, and papa innocentius with other begat this wyckid woman
transubsta^cion. Where as Christ, nethere his Apostelles, no nether long after
unto the consell of uercellen sein the time of leo theix about the year of our
lord 1052 and 300. year aster the death of bid. A wounders matter and an
horrible practyse of the Devil, that contrary unto the scripture and unto the
old fathers, this mystery is happened unto the sacrament. That these masters
of the later days fyghtso sore to defend, an accidens with out a subject. And
has taken from the supper, the thing that wese we touch, we taste, we eat we
drink and we swalow throwghe the throat, to say bread and wine, As the
Apostelles did and yeat say it is no bread nor wine. If it be alteryd some were
best that best can maintain alye to show how and by what words it is changyd.
By these words hoc est, it is not done. For noman can do more by the uertewe
of those words then Christ him self. Now Christ by these words declared that
it was his body. And not made his body. Then must ye show theother words that
wrowght this marvelous transubstancion. Or else we should make Christ alyer who
is the fontayne of all ueryte and truyth. But souch as defend this alteracion
of bread rather then they would say that by the words of Christ, Hoc est
corpus meum, were not made the uery body of Christ. They will expound this uerb
(est) per fit. And say thus, that by the pour of god and uertewe of his words
spoken by the minister, the substannce of the bread is alteryd into the
substannce of Christ bodi. So is Christ's bodi made present by this word est.
But this interpretacion the lettre without atrope will not admyt. Nether that
est schuld be expoundyd by fit. Nether that the bread should be made the body of
Christ, but that it is already the body of Christ before these words be
spoken, Hoc est corpus meum. If it be not before he call it the body, why
does he lie then. And call it other wyce then it is. If it be the body as he
says it is by what words of the scripture has he made the bread te body and
the wine the bludd. By these words, hoc est corpus meum, there is nether
bread nether wine alteryd. But the text says that the bread is the body, and
the wine the blud. Which this new doctrine will not admyt that bread should be
booth bread and also the it glorious body of Christ. For then duo corpora
essent simul in eodem loco. Which indeade reason will not grant. No More then
it is possible that a true body may be, and yet ocopy no place. Souch as would
defend a wicked and most damnable purpose good reader Clean contrary to the
nature of this uerbe (est) expound it per fit. Yet would they blind the people
and say they use plainly with out trope Christ words, and with open mo^the
cry out upon souche as booht reuently godly and lernydly botth wryt use and
speak of the sacramentz and say they be heretics people depertid from god and
all uertewe. When they them selfs use souch a trope as the scripture from the
beginning to the latter end, never usith se there trope in these words, Hoc
est corpus meum. Christ said takeye, eat of this, this is my body The popes
doctrine says, Under the form of bread is Christ's body. Thou seyst that
Christ said not so but said that the bread was his body. As no dout it was, if
Christis meaning betaken as well as his words as it must be of every
Christianeman and where Christ said est. They understond. Fit and teach Christ
to speak, as thowghe he could not for lack of words convenient, express his
mind in this matter. But these words of the supper diligently consyderyd, and
one Evangelist conferrid with the other with judgment, it may esely be seen,
that these words hoc est corpus meum, make no more for the transubstanciacy on
of the bread and the win. Then in noua fert animus. Mutatas dicere formas,
corpora, prouith, Verbum caro factum est, and habitabit in nobis. For if the
bread and the win, be not really and substancially the corporal and natural
body of Christ, this word est. Prouith nothing at all, and when they
interpretat these words, Hoc est corpus meum. An say that under the form of
bread is the body of Christ. I will not admyt that interpretacion. For asmouch
as it has no good ground nether in the scripture nether in the ancient
doctors as I shall declare here after. But because they accuse other men for
the use of a trope. I would not that they offend in the same. Irequire them to
bide stille in the letter. And to leave these gloses under the form of bread.
With the bread, in the bread or under the bread. Christ usyd none of these
terms nor yet the holy fathers. But plainly said. This is my body that is
broken for you and. Where as Christ sayse (this is) they say (under this
form) hereys a uery plain trope and figurative loquucion. Men seyth that they
admyt metonomian, and say under the form of bread is the true body of
Christ. Thowgh it be asfalse as godis true that they say. Adome thing without
senses, is no harbor nor duelling place, for Christ's precious body, nor for
the spryt of god. But the penitent and soroufull heart of the Christian by
faith logyth this goostlye and spiritual gestes. The soul of man created unto
the similitude of god. By faith is made the temple of god. To live in all
uertew and godly conversation ffolowing the stappes of Christ, and to exalt the
truth of his afflyctid and persequutid church till ye cum. Let these that
defend this alteracion of bread do that them selfs which they require of
other, and interpretat the words of Christ with out any trope. And then they
may the better accuse other men that use atrope. Incase they suppose there
troppe and manner of speech under the form of brcade, may better be made godd by
the manner and fraunse of the scripture, then this trope that we use to call a
sacrament, by the name of the thing that is signifiet by the sacrament, The
supper of the lord, the lords body, present at the contemplacy on of faith in
spryt, spiritually, and not corporally. For asmouch as I trust I have
sufficiently declarid that the papestes does use atrope. I would they should
name there trope, and prove it tobe true by the scripture that may warrant
there trope to be good they may not confirm there saynges with an old wives
tale and say that the holy fathers belyuid so. For the contrary will be prouid
that thauncynt fathers belyuid as Christ tawght. For booth they and every man
must be iudgid by the scripture. Now likwyce to the other part of the
sacrament. If the will refer this pronowne hoc only unto the sign and ad rem
simbolicam. Behold Luk and Paul and thou shall fee plainly, that nether
Christ called the win that the Apostelles drank his blud, nether, the prist
if he beliue Luke and Paul should not say, that under the form of win is
Christ's bludd But under the form of the cup or chalyce is the blud of
Christ. For Christis words be these. Hoc poculum est nouum testamentum in meo
sanguine. Why does the prist speak of the form of win when Christ speak of
the cup and not of the win. If there be no trope to be admyttyd in the
words of the supper (I will not admit this figure continens pro contento) let
them prove the goldin chalice, tobe transubstanciatid into the bludd. And say
there remaynith nor gold nor silver. The substannce of the gold is chaungyd
into the substannce of the blud of Christ. And then let them drink the chalice
as well as the win. And dout no more of gods pour in the cup, then in the
Bread. For he that said by the bread this is my body. Said likwyce at the
same time that the cup was the new testament. And bid them drink of it them
all, and if Hoc est corpus meum. Can alter tho substance of the bread then can,
Hic calix est nouum testamentum, alter the substannce of the chalice and then
as the eat the bread, they should drink also the chalice for these words of the
cup were spoken by Christ booth god and man. The same word spoken by the same
Apostellis in one sprit, at one time, for one purpose, to one and to the same
end, and he that can change the bred with, hoc est corpus meum. Can change the
chalice with. Hic est calix nouum testamentum I trow, or Christ perauenture and
his word^s, auaylid not as mouche in the gold as in the br^ad. And that were
wondre for the Psalmist says dixit and facta sunt Psalm. 148. he made all the
worold with aworde and of nothing and now should his mighty pour be abrydgyd,
no god Christian reader he can do now as he has don before time. Make the
thing that he purposith to make. But to make of bread his natural. Physical and
corporal body he never meant it. If he had donde. He would have so made it that
thou shuldes have sin it. As thou seyst heaven and earth, he would not be
ashamyd and hyde his body now gloryfied more then he was ashamyd to be trayce
him self and open his own person unto the wyckid companysent from the high
pristes and phariseis Joan 18. it is not therefore as they say. For the
scripture does not testify that our saniour Christ Jesus ever tok any other
nature then the nature of man, in the belly of the blessed uirgine Marie. And
until souche time as thou seyst the chalice eatyn as well as the bread belyued
not that the breadis alteryd more then the chalice. For as of the substance of
an old chalice sometime thowgh mass has been often said with all is made new
grotes^ So of a new singyng looffe that has bynne consccratyd with hoc est
corpus meum sometime has creping worms byningendrid. Yea and some time cast
into the ffyre and burnyd as Benno Cardinalis writtithe of Gregory the
seventh, other wise called Hilbrandus. Good prouffe has been tahen that bread
remaynith after the consecracion. For by the sacrament poysenid there was an
Emperor and Abyshope of Rome poysnid in what subject should this poison
remain, in some subject doutles, for Aristoles scole will admittyd no
accidens, to be without his subject, nether admytony accidens to peryshe
without his substance, and when these men that say the muld and rot of the
bread is nothing every man that has his senses knoyth it is a manyfestlye. For
so long it may be kept that it will rune rowne about thaulter, y^a if man had
no senses at all and knew the scripture, it were sufficient to prove that bread
remaynid stille after the consecration 1. Cor. 11. and there is no papist among
them all but will grant this, most folyshe and found contradiction some thynk
tobe nothing. Forse them to auswere what it is that corruptith. What it is that
is muldyd, then will they say, it is nothing thowgh ye se the uermynne
ingendryd of the bred crepe before your face. If this proposicion of
Aristotell should be disputyd an generacio unius sit corruption alterius. And
they would say that the generacyon of worms in the sacrament were ingendrid
of the corrupcion of nothing, he would not be able in Aristotyles scole to
auswere unto one argument. Farthere it is souche ablasphemy against god that
every Chrtstiane man awght to abhor it to say that any creature, can have his
being of nothing, this is properly the Epitheton of god to be of nothing, but
of himself, and if they say god has made these corrupcions in the sacram^nt
of nothing it repugnith the ^aythe that we have in the scripture Gonesis 2.
Igitur perfectisunt coeli and terra, and omnis ornatus little. So that after
those ui days wherein god mad the matter of all things, sith that time never
thing in this worold was made of nothing, there fore we must for the reverence
and honor of our says sck a^athere for these putrifactions in the sacrament.
It shall be the bread. Say what they will boothe by the judgment of the scripture
and also by reason, as for there terms that they cry, sye, upon souche manner
of speech and sye upon them, herytykes that belyu^ it is but bread and no
sacrament as long as it is kept in the pyx, it forsith not god for give them
they know not what they say. The devil has closyd there yeys, they have
nether judgment of senses, ner reason. But this false doctrine Lanfrancus
browght deuylyshly into the church after that he had optaynid of leo the ix.
That the good and godly man Berengarius should be condem nyd for an herytyke an
excellent clerk of great lernyng and notable uerteus, as platina makith mencyon
in uita Joan. 15. Who tawght and wrote that the corporal presence of Christis
body could not be in the sacrament. These men has conseuyd in them selfs
acertayne persuacyon of new and late iuuentyd doctrine and holdyth the same as
a principle of infallible uerite. And rather then they would depart one jot
from this adulterous doctrine^ They will grant an heresye not only folishe but
also detestable. A worm or muld in the bread, to beingendiyd of nothing which
is so far wide from the faith of (...) Christian man that itnedythe no
probacyon. God says Atanasius the ^ather a nullo est ^actus, nec creatus, nec
genitus. God when he would destroy the worold with water, by miracle, gathered
to gather too of cucry kind that lyuyd into thark of no^ that they might in
there kind replynis the worold again as we at this day se, and mad not every
thing again of nothing, no he made aster they ui days at the beginning never
othing of nothing. But that the substannce of one thing was made by and of the
substance of othere creatures. Every thing in his kind. Man, by god and man,
best by god and best, Christ himself god and man, by god and the blessid
uergyne mary. The muld and bestes that are ingendryd in the bread if there be no
matter whereof they should be ingendryd, they were no creatures. But whatlerning
is this tobe preachid and defendid among the people good Christian reader, to
prove some thing, nothing. God of his infinite goddenys r^store again his holy
word unto the people. And the right use of his sacraments, and give grace
unto the people to undrestond the manner of speech usyd in the scripture, and
to admyt that trope and figur^ in this holy supper of the lord that best
apperteynithe unto the nature of a sacrament. Most commuely usyd and ^amilier
in all other sacraments and to the use of our sacraments. By the scripture,
con^erring oneplace with other and not to send to the high pryst of Egypt or
unto the book of bishops decrees to know what our sacrament mean. Let us
sarch the scripture and makeit the gyde of our study as dauyd did Psalm. 119.
Lucerna pedibus meis u^rbum tuum, and lumen semitis meis. This we know that as
the supper of the lord is a sacrament unto us, so was Pesah unto the Chuldren
of Israel and for our Baptism they had circumficyon. As well was the promise of
eternal lief made unto them as unto us, as well they belyuid tobe sauyd by
Christ as we. They were of Christ's church as well as we, as well was Christ
delyu^id un to them in the use of there sacraments, as unto us. But not so
openly because he was not then born, nor had not suffiyd the death that there
sacraments representyd, as ours do declaring unto us what Christ has done
for us that now sittith at theright hand of god the father so that the
sacraments of thold testament, and the new in effect be one and give aright
censure and judgment of the one and then ar we instructid aright in boothe. For
as all the promyses of god from this unto Adame. Semen muli^ris conteret caput
s^rp^ntis Gene. 3. unto the last and final promise unto the Apostelles.
Sedebitis uos super seeds iudicantes 12. tribus Israel were made unto the
church in Christ, and for Christ, to save souch as belyuid from the course and
malediction of Adames sin and to stablysthe the weak infirmites of those that
receauyd by faith the promese. god annexyd unto the promese, these external
signs. Which we call sacraments, that they might set before our yeis the
benefitz of god^s mercy dew unto our faith in Christ and were as sea l^s and
confirmacions of gods promises where he warrantyd and assuryd his church
openly that he would be her god, and she tobe his spouse for ever, made here
adowre of liefe eternal and gave her these external signs wherein she might
always exercise here faith and in spryte have the godly conversation of
Christ when she would. As we may have daily in the use of the sacraments
thowgh not bodily, yet in spryt, and as uerely as we eat and drink Christ in
the holy supper, so did the fathers eat Christ in there sacraments no lease
Christis body then to be born. Then we, now that heis borne, then to come in
^he flesh into the worold, and now in the flesh departide out of the worold.
As saint Paul says 1. Cor. 10 omnes eandem escam spiritualem comedebant, and
omnes undem potum spiritualem b^bebant. Bibebant autem de spirituali, quae
illos co^mittabatur petra. Petra uero fuit Christus. He teachyth manifest ly
that the fathers eat in there sacraments Christ to cum as well as we that be
after his birth in this earth and ua le of misery. This was Christ the stone
that coniunyd the church of the prophets time, with, the church of the
Apostelles times, and mad booth these churches one too in external signs and
sacraments, one in effect to be sauyd in Christ one co^sernyng the substance
and effect of sacraments. I would aleyge for my purpose saynd August, who
undrestondyth and expoundid one way, and by one figure and trope, these too
textes. Petra erat Christus, and hoc est corpus meum. Saving that our faith is
not groundyd upon saynct Augustine nor any other man, but upon the word of god
thonly scripture, and also because I mind here after to declare the judgment of
Augustine and other of the holy ffathers concerning this matter. Be cause they
make with tholde truyth against this new papistrye. But ffyrst by the word of
god we must know what the nature and use of a sacrament is, thoffyce of a
sacrament is this, to show unto us uttwardly, that the merits of Christ is
made ours for the promise sake, which god has made unto those that belyue, and
these sacraments by faith doothe applicat and aplye uttwardy unto him that in
faith receauyth them, the same grace, the mercy, the same benefits that is
representid by the sacra^entes but not so by the ministracion of the
sacraments as thowghe they that receive them, were not before assuryd of the
same graces and benefits representid by the sacraments that we re amanyfest
error for incase the sacraments could give us ueri Christ the promise of god
were inuayne, the which always appertain uuto the people of god before they
receive any sacrament. But they be the testimonies of promese, and declare unto
us, for an infallible uerite and unto the church of Christ, that we be the
people that god has chosen unto his mercy and that by faith we possessyd
before Christ and in faith, frendshyppe, and amyte with god we receive thief
sacraments which or nothing else but abaygge and open sign of gods ffauour
unto us, and that we by this livery declare our selfs to live and die in his
faith against the devil the worold and sin. But he that supposith tho make
Christ his and all Christ's merits, by the rereauing of the uttward sign and
sacrament, and bryngith not Christ in his heart to the sacrament he may make
^ymselfe assuryd rather of the devil and eternal death as Judas and Cayn did
Matt.26. Gen.4. For the sacrament makyth not the unyon peace and concord between
god and us but it ratifith. Stablisshyth and confirmyth, the love and peax that
is between god and us before for, his promese sake. what is, the most
principal, significacion, and to what end every sacrament was ordeynid, it may
be lernid best, by the promise, annexyd, unto the sacraments. Qui crediderit,
inquit Christus, and baptisatus suerit, saluus erit. Mar. ult. therefore
baptism is callid a sacrament, because it is, annexid unto the promise of
eternal Joy, to testify that the promise of grace, uerely appertaynith unto
hyme, that is Christenyd yet to declare the uerteue of this more plainly. Let
us consider the words of baptism, the which conteynith in them selfs, thole,
and somne of the testament, the benediction wherewith we are consecratyd,
dedicatid and offeryd unto god, and gods name inuocatid upon us, after this
sort. I says the minister by the comanndement of god, and in the place of
Christ. Do Christine the. To say do testify, by this external sign, thy
sins to be wayshid away, and that, thou art reconsilyd, unto the living god,
of our mediatoure Jesus Christ, and this is the sign wherewith all, god markith
all that be living in this worold, and his ffrendes, by these means hesealith
in the, thassurance, of remission of sin, which thou haste first in sprit,
receauyd, by faith, and for the promise made unto thy father and his
posterite: for the promise of god the remission of sin, appertaynith not
only unto the father, but all so, unto the seade and succession of the father.
As it was said unto Abraam Gen.17. Ere firmacion of gods benefits toward
him, and then to manifest, open and declare unto the hole church (representyd
by the minister and souche as be present at thact) Christ that allredy
secreatly dwellith in his soul, that they may bare record of this love, amyte,
peax, an concord, that is between god and him by Christ. And for asmouche as all
dlspleasure, ire, uengeance an hatred between god, an him, is agreyd upon, by
thintercession of Christ whom faith before baptism, browght before^ the
judgment set of god to plede this charter of remission it is thoffyce of the
church which has an open an manifest declaracion thereof to give god thanks
for the preseruacion of his church and for the acceptacion of this crystenid
person into the comune wealth of his sauid people. Remembering that only those
be appertayning unto god that be thus callid openly into the uisible church and
congregation (except death prevent the act) and souch as contemn this
sacrament be not of god as Paul says. Quos praedefinierat, eosdem and uocauit
Romans 8. When they may be receauid as they were institudyd, and ministrid by
souch as the law of god apoyntid in the ministry of te church no Christian
should omit for any occacion the doing of them. But where as souche take upon
them as be not lawfulli callid unto the ministration of sacraments, as where
the sayge fame, or mydwiffe for danger of the chyldes soul will Christine it.
It is aprophacion of the sacrament and not to be suffrid the child shall
reyoyce eternally in heaven with Abraam Isaac an Jacob for Christ's sake whois
merits apertaynith unto thinfant for his fathers faith. This un godly opinion
that attribuith the salvation of man unto the receiving of an external
sacrament. Does derogat the mercy of god, as thowgh his holy sprit could not
be caryd by^ayth into the penitent and sorrowful conscience except it ryd
always in (...) cherot and external sacrament. This error has ignorance
browght into church because the ministers this many yers knew not to what end a
sacrament was institutyd. They contend upon certain words of the scripture
Joan. 3. Mar. ult. How be it understond aryght an the circumstannce of the text
markyd it prouit nothing. Nicodemus was aman of sufficient health and ayge and
nocause why he should not receive that holy ceremony of baptism. Marks words
appertain likwyce cheiffely unto souch as were apt to hyre the gospel and
souch to be Christenyd. Notwithstonding they may like wyce confirm there by,
the baptism of infannce by this reason, Ero deus tuus and seminis tui post te.
Deducing this argument of those words, to whom so ever the promise of god
apertayne to the same the signs annexid unto the promise apertayne. To
thin^auntes the promise appertaynith. Ero deus seminis tui. Likwyce the signs
of the promise. Where as they say that baptism appertaynith unto the salvation
of all men that be of gods electes. I grant but not unto every of gods
electes I except those that die before they be Christenid, thin^antes of the
Christians of whois salvation we may not dout, of thinfidels infanntes I will
temerously nor damn nor save, saynct agustayne is of the contrary part against
me, how be that holy doctor yeuith me leave to leave his wrytingz and bylyue
the scripture. If it were my porpose to reason that matter I would get great
ayede out of other his works to serve mine opinion. And as for thexcuse of the
mydwiues Christening. By thexample of Zippora moses wief Exo. 4. that
circunsicid in the time of need it may not prove the myd wiffes fact tobe godd.
For of one private and singular fact, nomam may make a general law. Epiphanius
that great clerk libro 3. contra hereses, To. 2. cap. 79. prouith mine opinion
with strong arguments, Si mulieribus praeceptu^ esset sacrificare deo, aut
regulariter quicquam agere in ecclesia, oportebat magis ipsum mariam
sacrificium perficere in nouo testamento etc. at non placuit, read the
chapter, Moses was in danger of death because he neglectyd the commanndemet of
god which was to circunsice the viij day. Ge. 17. As he supposid after the
judgment of the flesh it should have hindrid the chyldes health be cause they
had along Journey to travel. Souch good intencions contrary unto the word of
god wese cruelly reuengyd diverse times. The sacraments must be usyd as they
be commaundyd, and to the same end that they be commanndyd. The ministeri of
Christ's church cheyffly dependyth in the preaching of the gospel, and the
ministracion of the sacraments, and as the preaching of the word is not
thoffyce of awoman, no more is the ministracion of the sacraments. To what end
and to whom the sacraments must be yeuen. Saynct Paul teachith Romans 4. Where
he callithe circuncision Sphragida eius iusticiae 1. acceptationis in
gratiamdei, quae per^idem apprehenditur. It is the Mark and seal of
acceptacion into gods grace. Reseauyd before by ^aythe and this external
sacrament was as the conclusion and sealing upp of all that god had promisid
unto Abraam before. To say inte benedicentur omnes gentes terrae, With many
other promeses as is expressid in the book of Genesis from the 12. chapter
unto the 17. where as circuncision was yeuen. For this word. Sphragizo
signifies. Sigillo notare, insignire and concludere By the which word an text
of Paul it is manifest, that by the sacraments, gods promeses be not first
yeuen unto man. But that by the sacraments the promise receauid, is confirmid.
For Paul discernit applicationem gratiae, ab ipsa circuncisione, as in the
same 4. chapter he she with more plainly. Where he declaryth the condition of
Abraam, what he was before he receauid this sacrament, prouith him first to be
the friend of god credidit Abraam deo and imputatum est ei, ad iusticiam. As
aman first assuryd of god he receauid this sacrament, and sawght not first to
find him in an external sign. So does allmen at this day if they markyd what
is requiryd of them before they receive any sacrament. There is not so mouch as
the specheles infant but by his parents is bonnd to give account of his faytk,
before he be Christenid, and as Joan sait 1. cap. dedit eis utliceret filios
dei fieri, uidelicet his qui credidissent, in nomine ipsius. So that none is
admittid unto the sacraments but souch as be gods ffrendes first by faith.
Abraam credidit. Abraam belyuid. Thinfant belyuith, Cornelius belyuid Acto. 10.
and as one came unto the sacrament our father Abraam as the friend of god. So
cummyth all the wo^old that follow his faith and confirmith gods promise with an
external sign as Ishall declare more plainly from the first sacrament unto
the last, Adame offryd sacrifice unto god so did Abell, Genes. 4. they had
certay manifest and open sacraments gyu^n unto them by god, that there
oblations were acceptable, because the sprank out of the fountain and lief of
all godd works from faith and the fere of god, Abe^les ^amme was by miracle
bornyd with celestial fire, and Caynes sacrifice nothing acceptyd to broothers
having one father and one mother what should be the cause that one receauyd an
open an external testimony of gods love and not the other Paul declarith the
cause To. 14. Ebre. 11. sine fide impossible est placere deo, accedentem ad
deu^ oportet credere. Abell because, before the sacrifice, he was acceptyd by
faith into gods favor the religion of his heart was declared openly unto all
the worold. Cayne that thowgh god would be pleasid with an external ceremony,
with out an internal reconsiliacion, was openly declared tobe an hypocrite
with out faith or any godly mocion. Therayne boue yeuen unto Noe was a
sacrament of gods and corfirmyd these words. Non adijciam ut amplius maledicam
humo propter hominem. Ethoc signum ^oederis quod ego do inter me and te, and
inter omnem animam uiuentem quae est uobiscum, in generationes perpetuas. Arcum
meum posui in Nube etc. Genesis 9. had not Noe first belyuid the promise of god and
been acceptyd into the favor of god this arc in the clluddes had as mouch
edified him, as all the miracles that wrowght by Moses in Egypt before Pharao
Exodi 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Pesah Exodi 12. nothing auaylid, no nor was not used
without the dew circunstannces there prescribit, that souch as eat of it were
first instructid what it meant, an but in remembrance of gods benefitz an
mercyes unto them an then as people of godlynis an godly religion, they eat it
with thanks. What is thermore to be said. As the promese of god is receauid
by faith, so must the sacraments be also. And where as faith, is not no
sacrament auaylithe, Read 8. chapter of thactes of the Apostoles. And confer
Simon magus. With the queen of candes servant, and Mark what d^fferens is
between him that lokyth to find Christ in an external sacrament and him that
comith with penitence and assurance that god is his throwgh Christ. The One Simon
woold have had the pour to have yeuen the holygoost to whom he list, not for
his belyffes sake, but for money. Peter said, Non est tibipars, neque sors in
part hac, the queen's servant conuertyd from the boten of his heart, belyuing
the preaching of Philippe, would be (...) Christian also utwardely. Said unto
the servant of god. Ecce aqua quid uetat quo minus baptizer. Dixit Philip pus,
Si credis ex toto cord, licet. If thou belyue with all thy heart, it is
Lawful. The godly man s^yd. Credo filiu^ dei esse Iesum Christum. Ibelyue the
son of god to be Jesus Christ. Thus first assuryd of Christ, took openly.
Christ's ^euery. The same diversity may be seen Mat. 26 Mar. 14. and Luce 22.
by Judas and the rest of the Apostelles concerning the receiving of Christ's
supper. So that I prove here by that all sacraments appertaynith unto none
but, unto souch as first receive the promise of god to say remission of his
sin in Christ's blud, of the which promise these sacraments be testimonys
Wy^nysses. As the seal annxyd unto the writing is a stablyshment an making
godd of all things co^^^ynid and specified within the writing this is usid in
all bargayns, exchanges, purcheses an contractes. When the matter intreydyd
between too parts is fully concludyd upon. it is confirmyd with obligacions
sealyd entrechangeble that for ever those sealys may be awytnis of souch
couenantes as has been agreyd upon between the booth parthes, and these wrtingz
and seals makith not the bargain. But co^firmith the bargyn that is made.
Noma^ usith to give his obligacion of debetr, before there is some contract
agreyd upon betwyne him and his creditour. Nomam usith to Mark his neyghbores
Ox or horse in his Mark before he be at a full price for the Ox. Or else were
it felony and thyffte to robb his neyhgbowre, euery^man^usith^to^Mark his own
gods and not another man's. So god in the comnue wealth of his church does
not Mark any man in his Mark until souch time as the person that he Markith
be his. There must ffyrst be had acommunicacion between god, an the man to know
how ^e can make any contract of frendshippe with his ennymie, the living god he
confessith his default and desirith mercy, usith no purgacion, nor translation
of his sin. But only besechithe mercy, and layth Christ to gayge and says
for asmouch as thou have yeuen thy only sone for the sin of the worold
merciful lord, have thou not likewice yeuen all thing unto sinners that repent
with him. Then likewice lord for give me, and be my god, booth in faith and
also in thy sacraments, and as trewlie shall I ferue the during my lief as
these words pass my monthe, I renownce the devil, the worold an sin upon
this faith and promise mad to god we be markyd in gods mark. An none other
wice. For the church ever teachyth amendment of life before he prom ese grace.
So god preached to Adam Genesis 3. Esa. 1. Matthew. 3. Mar. 1. Recipistite and
credit Euangelio. Men may not com like swyne unto the sacraments. With cry
god mercy godd gostely father and you. But he must repent from the botom of
his heart, and leave the things that erst has been committyd against god. The
Idolatre his Idolatry. The swerer, his oaths thadulterer his adultery, the
dronkerd his dronkenys, men that tradith in the worold, all false and in just
co^tractes. The slaunderer his deuillishe tongue. Or else never com to sermon nor
receive sacrament. But Alas with souch faith as the receive the sacraments in
the same faith the lyuith, not as people created unto the similitude of god, to
obey iustes and honest, but to serve all uncleanlynis and abhominacion. As it
is daily tobe seen as well among then that yetlyue in supersticion. As among
them that professith to know Christis gospel. There living as mouch lik unto a
Christian manes, as antechrist unto Christan god unto the devil, if they that
know, at lest way they say the know the gospel will nobetter follow the
gospel, let them cast the testament into the fire, for they know to there
damnacion that will not follow there knolege. To be achristiane it is not so
light as men make it, of all the crastes in the worold it is the hardyst, not
to pratle and prate of it. But to practyse it in lief. For it is a
sciens^practyue and not speculatyue. Consistitin Action and non in lingua. God
give grace these holy sacraments may be moore often, and more reverently usid,
the neglecting of them is to be condemnyd, mouch more, the contempt of them.
But every man must be aright instructyd why and to what end he usith them as
well as to receive them, he that is ygnorant of the causes can never judge
aright of theffect, he that knowith not the cause why god made man. Shall live
always like abest, and apply his lief to an other end, then god made it for,
to serve him in justice and uerteus liefe, he applies it more like adogg and
Brute best contrary unto the order of god and makyth the ymayge of god,
theymayge of Cacodemon obeyng ever lust that repugnith unto the will of god. So
far has the devil and sin preuailid that in manner there is nether the one
sect of people called papists nether the other called gospellers, that caryd for
the lyefe of the gospel. Souch custom of isle, has made so weak, our
corrupt nature, that it fleyth all honesty, and honest laws that should keep it
in order, and of a spiritual liberty yeuen unto us, by Christ in the gospel,
we take a carnal lyence and wantones of liefe, so that we make uery little or
no resistaince at all. Assensus est infirmus, and cor habet contrarios impetus
pugnantes cum lumine dtuitus insito mentibus. True or the words of Medea.
Video meliora, proboque, deterio ra sequor ac fertur equis auriga, nec audit
currus habenas of every thing the principal cause must be knowyne, to say the
cause final the which is first to be consider^d. As in a commue wealth, the
final cause of all laws and the commue wealth likewice is to live well. The
f^nall cause of phesike to cure the sike well. The final cause of Rethoricke
to persuade well. And the principal and cheiffe cause of all the sacraments
that be now in the church of Christ or ever where in the church of Christ, is,
that theybe and ever has been, the signs of go des will, an pleasure toward
us testimonijs and seals annexyd unto the promese of grace. They be not the
thing that they represend but signs and remembrances thereof way the scripture
diligently Christian reader and sarch for the truith there. God has bound his
church and all men that be of the church to be obedient unto the word of god.
It is bound unto no title or name of men, nor unto any ordinary succession of
bishops or prystes, longer then they teach the doctrine contaynid in the
scripture, nomam should give hyring unto them but follow the rule of Paul. Si
quis aliud Euangeliu^ docet anathema sit he that teachyte any other gospel
them Christ's, it must be a cursid. God has preseruyd in all captiuites and
persequution of the church miraculously one book the holy bible deliuerid the
same unto the church and bound the church un to this book. As Christ says
Joan. 14. paracletus autem ille qui est spiritus sanctus, quem spiritu^ mittet
pater noie meo ille uos docebit omnia, and suggeret uobis omnia, quaecunque
dixi uobis. He says that his holy sprite shall teach none other doctrine the^
he himself tawght and the same that he tawght. Therefore with draw thy heart,
from this openyon that they would deceive thy soul with all, under the
pretense of holy church, they on lybe, the church, that (...) holy book the
bible hyrith it, learnyth it, and ^olowith the judgment of it. He is a
Christian man that leuith the word of man and kepith the word of god, Si quis
diligit me, sermone^ meu^ seruabit, and qui habet praecepta (...) and seruat
ea, ille est qui me diligit Joan. 14. Paul commaundedyd, Timothe to be
studious in the scripture, and not to study in Talmud, nor darash or othere
decrees of the Pharisees. 1. Timot. 4. Intend lectioni also Collos. 3. uerbum
Christi abundet inter uos. To that purpose the holy ghost would the scripture,
to be wroten, to detect all falshode, that gods name might be aright called
upon in Christ only, and not with inuocacion of ded saynces and his holy
supper, to be usid as a communion unto all men under booth kinds, and not to
be made amasse of, that blasphemit god, for souch as honor the bread there for
god does nolesse ydolatrie, then they that made, the son, there god, or
sterres. David says Psalm. 101. scribentur h^c in generatione altera, and
populus qui creabitur, laudabit dominum, to what purpose has Christ yeuen us,
his sacraments, and wroten openly, manifestly an sufficiently, the true use
how they should be usid in the scripture. When nomam or few men will observe
the commandment of the scripture. But rather the dreams and detestable
decrees of heretical an pharisaicall Bishopes. And meyntayne there laws in
the church, be the never so deuillishe. It were as god burn the Bible, as to
serve, to no purpose, for the holy water boket, sittith in the church at te
right hand of the Bible and not so hardy ons to melle there till the water
coniuryd call him, and the^ most the holy bible s^rue lik a hand may de
awyckid purpose, to color a stinking ceremony that aspringes my dominie. May
prove holy water to be a good and godly ceremony. And hoc est corpus meum,
after thinuocacion of dead saynctes is callid, to make good the wickid mass.
Wherein is not as mouch as one thing good saving the scripture, which they abuse
to an other purpose then it was wroten for. Doutles the princes of thearth unto
whom god committith the ciuille governance of the people, shall sustain thire
of god, for there negligent endeavor in this behalf, be cause they suffer
souche preachers, and byshopes, to rule over the conscience of there subjects,
where only the law of god should have place. These things should move all
Christian princes, to a reformacion of these wrongs that god susteynith by
taking away his word from the people. The miserable blindenis that the people
bein with danger of Eternal damnacion, because of Idolatry, should cause
princes to rue upon there woeful state an condition. Yea there own estate and
princely digni te yeuen unto them by god should move them, to remove this isle
out of there Kealmes, or else other men will usurp falsely there auctoryte, and
pervert thorder of god in the commune wealth. Therefore in the most noble an
famous commune wealth that ever was, the commune wealth of the Israelites. Was
this order apoyntid. Number. 9. first god, then his word, the celestial signs
the pillar of, fire, and the cloud, which were as gydes in there Journey to
show them wen and where the should camp, and likewice when and which way they
should march foreward in the Journey in the forth place of this commune wealth
was Moses apoyntid as supreme head and prince next unto god in the fight place
was appoyntyd the pristes then the princes inferior, and capitaynes. Then the
people, then all things necessarys to maintain this commune wealth whetherit
were in time of peace or time of war. Now he that consyderith the face of
this common wealth. May ^e many notable things, and ^pecially for my purpose
on which shall prove that princes sustain wrong by ^ouch bishopes as be within
there realms. Thowgh that Aron and his sons with the rest of the pristes had
the ministry of te church committ^d unto them, yet were they never so bold to
make any law for the people conserning conscience or to bring any ceremony into
the church without the judgment and knolege of gods word, and Moses the
prince. As it may be well seyne by souch as could not celebrat Pesah in the
time apoyntid, because of certain impedimentes re^ersid. Nu. 9. this cause of
religion, was not browght unto the byshope and pristes to be definid. But unto
Moses, who counselyd the lord and there upon wysid his subjects what was to be
don in souch acase. Read the place. This declarith that no general council,
no provincial as^emble, no byshopes of any Realm or province, may charge the
subjects thereof with any law or ceremony otherwice then the prince of the
Land, by the word of god can give account to be godd and godly. For the people
ar committid unto the, prince, to sustain the right of them all, and not only
to defend there bodis, but also there souls. As it may be seen by the
co^playnt of Moses unto god Nu. 11. Curafflixisti seruum tuum, and quare non
inueni gratiam in oculis tuis, ut poneres onus uniuersi populi huius super me
etc. he was so care full, that no law was among then. But that he was able to
assure every of his subjects, that god was thauctor thereof. Now if we consider
the commune wealth of Christ's church, in our days, is there any prince that
can warrant all the laws of the church to be good and that god is the auctor
thereof. No god knowith they can not do it. And right well iam assuryd, souch as
make the princes belyue they are good cannot Bringforth and make good thauctor,
except the say the devil (auctor of all isle) is thauctor. Now to remove this
petyfull and m^serable ruin of the church let all princes for the love of
god, and for the restoring of there own princely honor. Take Moses and the
Prophets, the Evangelists, and the Aposteles to judge whether the yoke of
there subjects be tollera, ble or not, if it be not, of gracious petye to
remove it, and lik aprince, warrant them from all other mennys subjection and
laws, and let not abyshope be check mate and hayle fellow wel^ met, if the
prince rule the body the byshope to sit in the quere an rule the soul, as in
dead there is more bishopes Decrees, laws and Statutes in the church, for the
soul, then civil laws in any Realm for the body. Where as every commune
whealth owght to have but too goueruers. God and the prince the one to make a law
for the soul, the other for the body all the kings officers to be minister^ of
the law made to the conseruacion of the commune wealth, and the byshopes to
be ministers in techurch, of the law that is prescribid by god, as all justice,
Meres, Shereues, constables and bayliffes. Be ministers of the law made unto
them, to govern the commune whealth. So must the byshopes. Pristes and all
other preachers, be ministers of Christ and govern the people in there
uocation according unto the law prescribid by god. As Paul willid the people
to judge of him and of his companyous 1. Corint 4. Sic nos estimet homo ut
ministros Christi, and dispensatores mysteriorum dei, quod superest autem,
i^lud requiritur in dispensatoribus, ut fid us ali quis reperiatur, There is no
more requirid of the byshope but that he be d^ligent, and faithful in
thexecution of gods word. It is not requirid that he should make any law for
the people. But to preach gods law with all diligens and study. As they do
must neglige^tly. The year last past upon certain occacious at my being in
Inglond for lack of expedicion of mine affayrs I was compellyd to remain in A
town longer then I would having communicacion with certain of the citicus of
many matters sowgh of my part, only to have occacion to healpe there pour
conscience, from the snare of ignorancy. When I perceauyd, I had optaynid there
willing audiens. Idemanudyd of them when there byshope (for of the town the
byshope has his name) preached among them. And the contents of his sermones.
They told me that he never preachyd sermon in the town. Iaskyd what deputes he
had in the town apayntid to preach, they said none. And Ibelyue it the
better, for aslong as I was in that town, there was never sermon, ^amentyd the
people, for. I sound a great many apt, and ready, by inspiracion of gods sprit,
to hyre the truith, if they had a preacher. For at one talk and communicacion,
as mouche as they could comprehend they belyuid, the rest they stood in dout
of. Then I willid them diligently to lern the gospel, to auaynce it in word,
and to set it forte with thexa^ple of all honest liefe. And told the^, that
there were, too general rules to lern and know god by, the first, by his word
whereby our fathers, before thowsandes of yers knew him. The second was to know
god, by his dear son, openid and declarid in Jerusalem, unto the worold, and
that god can, nor will beknowen, none other wais, then by his word, and by h^s
son Christ Jesus. Joan. 10. Here in this town the byshope of the dioces,
from the time that he was appoyntid by the Kings maiestatie, unto that most
paynfull office, he preachid nether god, nether the devil. But let his floke
wander, as sheep without a sheperd. They say yet all, that there diaeceses be
well instructid and gouernyd, and they do according unto there ^ffices. For
south as mouche there diligens is correspondent, and there factes, agreyng with
there name for they are called diaecesani. Of diaeceo that signifith to govern
and to defend. As Absalom factes agreyde with his name. His name signifies the
peace and tranquillite of his father. But his factes was the affliction of his
father, and bauyshyd him out of his realm. 2. Samuelis 17. so does the
byshopes govern the churches committyd unto there charges, and defend tem from
false doctrine. They be in structyd in the pater noster. The creed, and the
co^maundementz and has the sacraments, ministrid unto them (would to god
aryght) what all this. It is noti nowgh, the may have all these things, and
yet nothing the better. Hierome writith of an heremite in uitas patrum. That
said, Nullum opus difficilius quam dicere preces deo, no work more difficile
then to pray unto god, how be it many men thynk nothing to be more facile and
easy. When Christ says Joan. 4. Very adoratores adorabunt patrem in spiritu
and ueritate. The true worshippers shall wurshyppe god in sprit and uerite. The
difficulty (is sone perceauid, let inuocacion be in sprit, to say in the godly
mocyon of thart, not with the tongalon, nor with hypocrisy. It must be in
truith to say, in a true knolege of god. Directid unto god onliby Christ. And
by no dead saynct. So that in prayer these too ar necessary, a true knolege of
god, and the spiritual mocyon of tharth. Or else prayer is but inanis
battologia and inutile murmur. The creed must wekly and daily, and also the
commaundemetes be opened unto the people, there by the may, know god aryght,
fere his justice against sin, and tak solace and confort in his merciful
promises for Christ. Only the commandments of god contain souche acopiouse,
and profunde doctrine, that it can never be known sufficientli. Nor never with
sufficient diligence declared unto the people. It is the Abrydgment and Epitome
of thole bible, compendiously containing thole law and the gospel. Not one
proposicion in the scripture, but has his commune place in the 10.
commandments. And he that undrestondyth them well is a godd Christian man
if he follow them, he that undrestondit not them can be no Christian men. There
is every man's office and dewty describid, what is to be done whether it be
to wards god or man. And whether he be, minister in te church, or in the ci^le
wealth^ of what condition so ever he be, there may he learn how to follow his
uocacion. It is not sufficient for a Chr^stiane man to be live one part of the
scripture, But faith is aryght persuacion and willing consent unto the hole
word of god. For he that says, Credes in deum patrem, filium, and spiritum
sanctum, the same god sa^^h, Ambula coram me and esto integer, What auaylith
the bragg of ^ayth, where as is no uerteues lief. He that said, iustificati
igitur ex fide, pacem habemus erga deum, per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum.
Roman. 5. Et nulla condemnacio est lex his, qui insiti sunt Christo Jesus. Says
likwyce, Quod si quis spiritum Christi non habet, hic non est eius. Et si
secundum carnem uixeritis moriemini Romans 8. And as we belyue that Christ died
for our sins. So must we belyue, that he died likwyce to give us an Example
to die from sin and the concupiscens of the worold. Paul says quod mortuus
fuit, peccato mortuus fuit semel. Roma. 6. Peter says: Cum igitur Christus
passus sit pro nobis carne, uos quoque iuxta eandem cogitationem armemini, quod
qui paciebatur in carne, destitit a peccato in hoc, ut iam non concupiscencijs
hominum, sed uoluntati dei, quod superest in carne uiuat, 1. Pet. 4. He that
said unto Peter pasce oues meas Joan. 21. And to the rest of all the Aposteles
Matt. 10. Acto. 1. That theyshuld be, mynisters of the church, tawght then like
wyce how the might pleace god in there uocacion. Said not goblisse abucket of
water. Holow, bow. Candell, bell, chalice, fount or any souch begery, Matt.
29. but bid them teach, that he had said unto them: and repetyd the same Mar.
ulti. Ite in uniuersum mundum, and praedicate Euangelium omni creature, preach
the gospel unto the worold. This was the manner of Christ's ministeri in te
church. Before this supersticion and Idolatry was hard of. So tawght Paul
Acto. 20. 1. Tim. 6. Peter 1. Pet. 5. thus said god to Hieremye Hie. 1. Fili
hominis, dedi uerba mea in ore tuo. He that speakith in te church, must speak
the word of god. He that will pleace god, must pleace him as it is, prescribid
in the scripture, or else all that ever he does, is nawght if the byshope or
prist will pleace god or any other man let him apply, only his uocacion
oppointid by the scripture and as the scripture teachyth him. If he be aiudge,
to keep justice without respect of persons, if alawer to defend nothing but te
right. If Aphisiciane, diligently to cure his passion, and not to take so many
cures for auaryce in his haud, as the one part, may happen to dye whiles he
curith thoter, if a byshope not, to have so many parishis in his diaecesis, as
ten diligent lernid men can not ons in ayere know the faith of souch fowls as
has the charge of Christ's flock nethet how the pour simple people
beliuithe. Examyne souch as ar bound to use the secramentes of Christ's church,
an among athowsand, there is not one that knowith what a sacrament is, more
then an Ass. And to souch the sacraments be not profetable, but damnable. As
ye may see Esaias 1. yea when they be not usid according to there institucion.
God so abhorrith them as things repugnant unto the law. As we read Hiere. 7.
Non praecepi patribus uestris de holo caustis. Et Psalm. 50. Holocaustis non
delectaberis. The prophets by these words declarid, that no ceremoniesar
requirid of any man, without the knolege and confidens of the promise, confirmid
by the ceremony or without true repentaynce, and faith, for the sacraments in
the church of Christ nether makyth the love nor reconsiliacion between god and
man nor reteynith it not, it must be receive and Kept by one means to say by
lively says. Romans 5. Judas by the sacrament, receauyd not the promese, nor by
the sacrament was preseruid from desperacion Matt. 26. But he that will be the
friend of god and godly use his sacraments must use them after the form
prescribid by hyme only. And know what a a sacrament is by him. To say an hody
ceremoni, a work of the third commandment. Who says memento ut diem sabbati
sanctifices Exo. 20. and before the works of the third communndement wherein
all ceremonies ar conteynid must always precead, the works of the first
commandment and of the second, an inward faith an certain knolege of god,
and an owtward profession of his holy name, to acertayne the church, that he is
gods ffrende, and reconsilid in Christ, or else it were a praeposterous order
to set the cart before the horse. Lik as if the Kings maiestis officers, should
give his lyuery, unto him that the King never meant, to take into his seruise.
So to were, his liuere without profeit. Thus I desyrid to admonish the good
Christian reader of, before I entryd the disputacion of this most holy cause
conserning, the blessed sacrament of Christ's holy passion an death. That he
should know that god yeuith his gracies an promese of re mission of sin only
for Christ's sake, which we receive by invisible faith, and stablys the same,
by the use and exercise of sensible sacraments. Thewhich in place an tymear
never to be spoken against, with tongue nor wroten against by pen. Now that
these words, can make no alteracyon, of the bread an win, nor, make the
natural, corporal, nor physical presens of Christ's body. The first reason
is, that the words, Hoc est corpus meum, prouith that the bread is already the
body, before the words be spoken, or else they mi^name the thing and call
bread flesh. The second reason. If the words and the thing meant by the words
be one, th^n is the cup and not the win in ^he cup, the testament in
Christ's blud Luce 22. 1. Co. 11. Thirdly if it were the uery body of Christ
corporally present, Christ's words were not true, for he bid them do it in te
Remembrance of him. Now the Remembrance of a^hing is not the same self
thing, that is remembrid, as many men use to remem hre aweyghty matter, by
alitle ring upon there finger. If Christ's most honorable body were present
corporally in the sacrament it were no need remembrance at all, for the thing
present, presentith it self without thealpe of memory. Turn they which ways
the list, these words, Hoc est corpus meum, will not serve for there purpose,
except they add there interpretacion, the best gloss they have, is this, that
these words, Hoc est corpus meu^, bringith with them the body of Christ but
this is there interpretacion of the text, and not the meaning of the text.
Pondre every word and first this pronowne hoc. Which de montratiue they refer
unto the bread and win only. How be it we may with saynct Paul referr hoc
unto ^hole action an ceremony of the supper, as well as unto the bread an
win. Paul says not, Hic panis est communio corporis Christi, as thowgh we
should think, that he spoke of the bread only. But with plain words says,
Panis quem frangimus, to declare that the bread is not the sacrament of
Christ's body, till it be broken unto the church, according to thinstitucion of
Christ a spiritual meat. As Paul callith it, so that the bread lyffte upp
over the prystes head, nor kept in the box is not the sacrament, but the bread
ryghtly distributid. And in the same place he callith the bread broken, the
table of the lord by the which is undrestond thole institucion of Christ's
supper. And where men contend so much of this word corpus repeting thole hoc
corpus meum. Saint Paul the true interpretour of Christ's words, resoluith
them thus. Nonne panis que^ frangimus communio corporis Christi est. Where
Christ said this is my body: Paul says, is not the bread that we break a
communion of the body of Christ. Now what difference is between the communion
of Abodi and the body it self, and what Paul meant, by this word Coenonia,
communion it will be best known by the process of the text, when we perceive
what Paul's purpose was, to prove in the same place. Paul me^t in that place,
to with draw souch as had rec^^uid the faith of Christ at Cor. ffrom ffesting
of souch, a^ usid to eat of the meats dedicatyd unto Idols Logismos talis
est. His consideracion and intencion was to declare that it was Idolatryre, to
eat of ydoles meat with ydolatres. And prouith his proposicion deducing his
argument a comparatis if thisrae lites, in etyng the sacryfices dedicatyd unto
god, were participant of the thing that the sacrifices were offryd for. Then
souch as eat of meats dedicatyd unto ydoles were pertakers of the same
religion wherefore this meats unto ydoles were offryd. The first part of the
reason is true by the words that he a legith out of Moses. Videte Israclem,
iuxta carnem etc. They were suer to be pertakers of the temple that eat the
meat dedicatyd into the temple. So were they sure that eat of the meats
dedicatyd unto ydoles, pertakers of ydolatrye. Therefore Paul concludith thus.
Non potestis poculum domini bibere, and poculum daemoniorum. Non potestis
mensae domini participes esse, and mensae daemoniorum. They that communicatid
with the fideles, were participant of there religion: they that communicatid
with ydolatres, were like wyce participant of the ydolatrie. Now the same ways
that thinfideles were participant of the deuilles that they worshippid, the
same ways the fideles we reparticipant of Christ's body: in false faith were
the knyt and unit unto the devil in true faith the fideles unit unto Christ.
And as the ydolatres did not by hand with the meat dedicatyd unto ydoles
exhibit and deliver the devil to him that eat of the deuilles sacrament, so
those that eat of the bread broken by the minister, as Christ commanded had
not the body of Christ deliueryd by hand unto them but ^^re in communion and
societe with Christ and therefore did eat of one bread, dedicatid to be the
mystery of his glorious death. So does Paul's argument proceed that because
wear by faith one body mystically with Christ we eat of one mystical bread, to
testify the same, Quoniam inquit, unus panis and unum corpus multi sumus, Nam
omnes ex eodem pane participamus 1. Corin. 10. Paul in this place put too
churches, one of Christ, and the other of the devil all those at Corinth that
were of Christ's church, came unto Christ's sacrament, participatyd and
communicatyd with the company and societe of Christ's body, souch as were
infideles, or souche as were nether hot nor cold associatyd them selfs with
lik unto then selfs. And so declared manyfestly, that they were of the devil,
as the other were of god, not that the devil was yeuen I say by hand
(perauenture he had other businis at Ephesus or other where) but it sufficid
him that his members assemblyd to gather and ty participacio^ of the meat
dedicatyd unto his ydoles, in sprit communicatid with his sprit. Repet again
the proposicion of Paul 1. Corint. 10. Panis quem frangimus nonne communicatio
corporis est^in this word communio dependyth all the weight of Paul's
argumentacion. I have showed what communion is and which ways it is made by a
sacrament, conserning god, or the devil in this place of Paul where he
callith Epulas immolaticiorum esse daemoniorum Coenonian and illarum conuiuas
daemoniorum Caenonous. As communio in one place is taken in this purpose of
Paul, so must it be taken in the other, or else Paul could prove no conclusion
at all, by reoson of aequiuocacion of the worcester de^ And thowgh the word co^munio
be indifferent and may be taken boothe actyuely, and passiuely. Vtapud Latinos.
Communicare dicimur sieve al^s imparciamus aliquid, sieve ipsi cum al^s in
participationem ^eniamus But in this place of Paul it cannot be taken
actiuely, as men say, that the minister does exhibit, and give, by hand, the
corporal body of our most blessed savior Jesus Christ. For incase Paul
had mentony exhibition, dystribution or deliverance of Christ's body. He
would have declared his mind after an other sort. And have sayede: we are one
body, and that for the distribucion and delyueraynce of Christ's body: and not
have said we are one body, and that by the participacion of one bread. These
words shewith plainly that Paul meant nothing of yeuing or distributing of
Christ's body. But ^awght the Corin that souch as did eat of this holy
sacrament according to thinstitucion of Christ were pertakers of the
spiritual graces and communion of Christ's body and blud representyd by the
bread and as Christ was not really ner corporally present in those sacraments
and sacrifice of thisraelites that signifiyd Christ to cum. But by faith in
effect they receauid, the thing meant and representyd by the sacrifices. So like
wice we, thowgh that gloriouse body of Christ, be in heaven, that this holy
and most honorable sacrament representyth, yet when with true penitence we
receive the external sacrament, faith receauithe theffect of that precious
body representyd by the sacrament. This is Paul's doctrine, he meant of no
delyuerayncener exhibicion of that body ascendid into heavens there is no place
of the scripture shewith the nature of Christ's supper better then this place
of Paul whose, purpose was only to destroy this error among the Corinthions,
that was repugnant to true religion, souche as had proffessyd one god thowght
yet they might eat an drink wit in^id^lis of of souche meats as was offryd
unto Idols. Paul denith it, and says noman can be the membre of too
contrary churches, I would souch as god has yeuen knoleg unto, what is true,
and what is false, would l^kewice remember these words better and refrain
from the doing of souch things as there own conscience is persuadyd, to be
isle, they be to favorable unto them sel^es agreat dele and extenuat gods Ire
ad displeasure against Idolatri^, to mouche. They will not be able to make good
there act at the cumming of the great judge to judgment. To save a little mucke
and inconstant treasure of this worold, and to offend the majesty of the
living god, that has pore to loost booth body and soul in eternal fire.
Better it were to ffolow the commandment of Paul. Charissimi fugite
idolatriam. Vobis prudentibus loquor. God has ye^en unto many men this
prudence, to know that the mass is isle yet as isle as it is, they let nether to
say it, nor to hyre it which is uery Idolatry, and shall be cruelly reuengid
with out they amend Thenature of man by the infection of original sin, is so
corruptyd, and the heart so oppressid with contrary mo^ions, and uiolent
resistaynce unto uertew, that men never consent so willingly and sted fastly,
unto the knolege of uertew as they should do. Romans 1. S^d u^ritatem dei in
iniustitia detinent. This knolege that men has of god is deteynid with
injustice, as prisoner captive, it can bare no rule, in the soul for the
impetie of injustice which repugnith this true knolege. The man is drawyne with
his own lusts, and love of the worold, unto the contempt of god and
consentith not unto his true knolege, nethere unto the law that for biddith all
dishonestie and Idolatry. This auersion and malicious obstinacy of the will
must be daily mortified, or else it will work thine eternal displeasure, and
make the, the euela sting ennymie of god. Lament abuse of knolege and that thou
co^sentist not as well and as soon to the iugme^t of reason and follow it in the
principles practyue as speculatiue. Nomam douttith of this principle too and
too, to be four. ffoure and four eight. With all other geometrical and
physical principles. Men does not only acknolege them tobe true, but
co^sentith unto the same knolege. The other should be likewice as manifest, and
as sone consentyd unto as these. To say thole naturalle diversity of all
things honest and dishonest, and this light in mannis reason, the philorophers
call noticiam pri^ciporum. And man should consent unto these principles and
knolege of them, scilicet deo obediendum esse. Adulterium est uitandum. Honesta
pacta sunt seruanda, quod tibi, no^ uis fieri, alteri ne facias, these. I say
should be as soon consentyd unto, as to consent quod bis quatuor sunt octo. The
knolege remanyth of these things but the assent is infirm, by reason of
contumacie and rebellion of thart. Of all enymies an Ennymie most to be feryd,
whom Paul describit with these words sensus carnis, inimicitia est contra
deum, ann horrible description of man's natures, that it is the perpetual
ennymie of god, and will not be subject unto the law of god this infirmyte,
makith that men be ner hot nor could, cannot tell which part to take, in there
chamber to profess god where as none can bare record but amusse, nor none
edified by his knolege, Abroad in the worold, where as god should be spoken of
they know him not but as wisse and discreat men. Will do then as the most part
of people doothe. And would all were well, thowgh not long of them, for they
will Keep silence, for ever, rather then to speak as they know, yea and with
there exemple stablyshe the thing, that they know is nowgh. If god be god wy ar
people for fere so ashamyd to confess, if he be not god, let him go. God
abhorrith souch as be nor hot ner cold. If Christ's body be in heaven wherefore
is any man so hardye, to resort unto the place where as the pristes of Baall,
make apeace of bread booth god aman and teachith people to honer it, why does
they not consent unto there knolege, and follow it he that is partaker of the
sacrifice in the altar, is Partaker of the religion, meant by the sacrifice,
and those that be pertakers of like signs and sacraments, be declared there
by to be the members of one church. Wear unit and knyt to gather, made one by
one sprit of ^ewyth, wyh should we break this knot by external ceremonies, we are not made by eating of Christ's body corporally, nether the scripture
teachith of no souch union between him and his church. But by the sprit of god
receauid by says, as thou may well perceive how god the, father and his
son our savior, has yeuing this office and defense unto the holy sprit lik
god with them. Remember thy creade. Credo in spiritum sanctum, sanctam
ecclesiam catholicam. Sanctorum communionem, and thynk that it is by the yeuing
of gods sprit into our hearts for the most merciful death of Christ that
makith, this communion of saynctes, which is the church of Christ, and thus
all ready coniunyd with god, we receive the holy meat of his blessed body in
sprit by faith, not to make the union between god and us but confirm the union
in our selfs, and to show the lege of amyte unto the church. And to understond
the bettet what this word Caenoniae, communio is Red the fist capiter of the
first Epistole of Ioan^ where as this word communio is 4. times rehersid. There
shall thou se the communion between Christ's body an us, how it is made and by
what meanys. And then shall thou se that Paul 1. Cor. 10. and Joan so well
agreyth ^o mine interpretation, that the Christian reader will be satisfied I
trust in the lord, for as all the true subjects, sworn to the King by there
faith and alegaynce, ar pressed, and ready, where so ever the se the Kings Baner
spleyde, refort there unto and say, what so ever the King has to do, or with
whom so ever he has Ennymite with all, I will associat my self, to be of this
part, tide what be tide may, hap well, or woo. Unto this prince I unit my
liefe, and death, the cause. He is my lord, the making good and reason of the
cause. I am his sworn subject faith yeuen, and mi conscience bound. Therefore to
manifest mine obedience and love, by this baner I procleame liefe and death
against his contraries. So those that be Christ^s, when they see, the baner of
Christ the holy supper and sacrament of the death that wan the uictory of death
and the devil, they will there live and die, with this baner to declare there
obedience, they that be not of Christ, they care not under whois baner they be^
so the auaryce mind, and detestable love of the worold be satisfied it is godd
Inowgh to the^, with y^y. For south and nay for south, as inco^sta^t as the
wind lik unto the bishops laws in Inglond, that ten times has been Changid,
since I knew the right hand from the leffte, and yet were they proclemyd as
most certain and infallible uerites. With great penalty as mouche as Iieue wz
worth. But what man will be so made to lead his conscience by souch inconsta^t
persons, that has laws to damme, one year and to saw an other that, that is
good and catholic this year, shall be heresy the next year. They be more
inconstant then the wind, our lord of his mercy amend them and give the^ grace
to know there offenses. And to promote the only word of god. And theach the
people, thereby to know god and his sacraments. They would stablyshe the
carnal presence of Christ's body in the sacrament, by the words of Christ
Joan. 6. Panis quem ego dabo caro mea est, quam ego dabo pro mundi uita. The
bread that I will give, is my flesh which I will. Give for the live of the
worold they say that the first part of Christ's words, is a promese unto the
church to eat his precious body ln the sacrament, Panis que^ ego dabo, caro
mea est. And that Christ performyd this promise in his last supper, when he
made the bread his bodye^ And the rest of ^he words, quam ego dabo pro mundi
uita, is a promise that his bo die should be slain for the redempcyonof the
worold. Thus they interpretat the words of Christ, because dabo is twysse
repetyd. By the first dabo he promisid his real and corporal body in the
sacrament. By the second dabo he promisid the death of his body, so that they
would, these words, Hoc est corpus meum, should be the fulfilling and
delyueraynce of Christ's promise Joan. 6. Panis qu^m ego dabo caro mea est. Read
the hole sermon of Christ Joan. 6. and then thou shall perceive that this
interpretation cannot be admittyd. Christ meant to bring his audience unto the
knolege of ^aythe, that they might be pertakers of gods promeses throwgh him
only. And shewid them that he was the bread of consolacion and solace, to
satisfy the conscience of every Hungery and afflictyd person. Ego sum panis qui
de coelo descendi, si quis ederit de hoc pane, ui uet in aeternum. Etpanis quem
ego dabo, caro mea est, quam ego dabo pro mundi uita. Now Mark the words, the
bread that I shall give is my flesh, he promysid to give the bread by these
first words, that was his fles ^e. But how to give it to be eatyn, or to be
betyn, to be invisible in the mouth of the Aposteles or uisible with all
opprobrie and contempt before his judges, to be liff^ uppe over the pristes
head, and there sacrificid. Orelse upon the cross to sacrifice him self.
Christ that always, promisith with the thing promisid, how the thing promisid
may be reseauid, and usid prescribith the manner how and after what sort he
would give his flesh unto the worold, qua^ dabo pro mundi uita. I will give i^
for the liffe of the worold his body rent and torn upon the cross, was the
form, and manner how he would give it for the lyefe of the worold, not to be, in
the sacrament. But to dye upon the cross. As this relatyue quam declarith,
quam ego dabo pro mundi uita. The same fl^she that he spoke of in the first
part of the sentence. Panis quem ego dabo caro mea, of the same he speakith in
the second part, quam dabo pro mundi uita. And as the one part of the sentence
speakith of his body to be s^ayne and not eatyn, so does the other this may be
prouid by Christ's words ^n the same place, for he speakyth of his body that
should yeuelyue unto the worold, which only is by the body slain, and not eatin
as Paul says Romans 6. Ebre. 9. 10. as for the sacramental eating, where as
Christ's institution is trewly obseruid, there is nothing but Amemory of this
death where of Christ all togather spoke in the 6. of Joan, and interpre^atith
many times in that place this word eat, for belyue, qui confidit inquit mihi
habet uitam ternam. Nether the repeticion of this word dabo is none other thing
then accustomyd repeticion of one and the same thing, by more express words.
It is no meruell that people for lack of knolege and the holy sprit of god, so
obstinatlye defend the carnal and bodily eating of the body, for Christ with
all his words could not bring his carnal audience to a spiri^uall
undrestonding. As he meant: these words, Hoc est corpus meum, and panis quem
frangimus, nonne communicatio corporis Christi est^ Etpanis quem ego dabo pro
mundi uita, must be taken as Christ meant them, and as they may best agree with
the other places of the scripture. Wondrefull detrement should our fait take, if
the^ se words should not be taken with convenient tropes^ and figures, with out
atropelo what should follow, Christ's body to be. Pantotopon, Christ must have so
great abody as might fill heaven and earth, if it be corporally present booth
in heauin and in earth. Also it were inuaine to look for him at the day of
iugme^t or to complain that the spouse is taken away from us. For as the say,
they have him suere enough in the pyx, and will have till the woroldes end. If
it be true. I will say no more. Inde uenturus i^dicare ^iuos and mortuos, it
nedithe not to be live that heshall cum from heaven to judge the quycke and
dead, but to belyue that he shall cum out of the pyx, that hangith at eu^y
altar now her invisible and then, shall be sensible. But how can this lerning
agrey with the scripture that says, Videte and palpate, quia spiritus carnem
and ossa non habent, quae me uidetis habere Luce 24. how do^th this lerning
that says Christ's body to be every where agree with the words of thangelles,
Surrexit non esthic, uenite and uidete locum etc. Mat. 28. Pauperes hab^bitis
uobiscum, me non habebitis. Understand the words, hoc est corpus me^, without
a trope, and there shall follow souche conttadiction in the scripture, as may
not be admittyd better it is, to undrestond one place, by many, then many should
be made false, by the mystaking of one. They would agree these places, with
inuisibiliter, and modo celesti. To say that Christ's uere natural body is
here, but insensible. And does ocopy, no pla^e, althow it be as uery naturalle
and true abody, as man's body is except sin and immortalite^ Sed hoc dicere
facilius est quam do cere, it is not sufficient to say, but to prove that they
say this argument cannot be denied in Aristoteles scole, Corpus est, finitum
crgo est in loco^ if Christ have atrew body it must occopy place, in the
sacrament it occopyyth no place the^ it folowith it is not there. Other
probacion have then none. But only the sound of these words, Hoc est corpus
meum, the meaning of the words be against them. Aman may not take the letter,
with out the sense in amater of wayght. Cicero thetnick so willith. Semper
autem in ^ide quid senseris, non quid dixe^ ris eogitandum^. lib. offic.
Because we should never be troblyd with these gloses, invisible insensible, and
myraclousment. He causid his immortal and glorifi^d fle^ he, to be senseble to
chid and tried by the fingers of Thomas Joan. 20. As for the words of Paul ad
Ephesians. 4. Philippen. 2. that seem to show Christ's body now glorified to ocopy
no place. I refer it to the judgment and faith of the Christian reader where
Paul meant any souch doctrine or not, qui descendit, idem ille est, quietiam
ascendit, supra omnes coelos, ut impleret omnia. Thauctors of this doctrine,
does al^ige the text in A^ rong sense. For the scripture in many other places,
does confess Christ to be ascendyd Into heaueus. Therefore it is uerylik that
Paul would, not set him out of heaven. But rather by these words he ascendid
above all heauynes, be would amplyfy the inspeakable Joy of those glories that
his most precious body possessyth. The which in therth was debasyd and abiectyd
unto most uile ignominy and contempt^ so Paul declarit^ these too
co^traries^ most uile in therth mortale^ most glorious in heaven immortal.
Illud asce^dit quid est, nisi e^iam quod descendat prius in infimas parts
terrae? Etaddit, qui descenditidemille est; qui acendit supra omnes coelos.
Paul does way these too propositas and sets one against the other. In
infimas parts terrae descendere, and supra omnes coelos ascendere. And he that
will gather by these words, of Paul souch an argument. Christ ostendid above
all heavens, thereforu^ he is in no place, for out of heuean is no place. Then
may, likwyce gather of the other words this argument. Christus in infimas
parts terrae desce^dit, ergo nulnullum locum habuit in terra. But Paul
Christian reader meant no souche subtle tes in this place, is holy intencion
was to declate booth his inspeakoble contempt that he had in this worold, and
also his most glorious loy and honor that now the body has in heaven, and
does interpretat himself ad Philip. 2. qua propter and deus islum in summam
extulit sublimitatem etc. my faythis that his blessed body, is in heaven and
does abid stille in heanen, and not our of heaven Christ said, Vbi ego sum,
ibl erit and minister meus, Erimus autem in coelis, non extra coelos, aut supra
coelos, extra omnemfci licetlocum 1. nulllbi. Paul says: Nostra connersatio
in coelis est, ex quo exspectamus and saluatorem. And do^he likwyce the same.
2. Corint. 5. this is a tr^w faith which I beliue. And where as the call
Christ's body athyng celestial and Divine true it is immortal and delyueryd
from all mortal qualites according to Paul's words. To. 6. Viuit Deo and
^ultra non morietur. What can be in ferryd hereof, the fruit of the blessed
uirgine has not lo ost his humanite, but in heaven his body is as uery true
^^^eshe an blud as it was hanging upon the cross immortalle and yet uery man.
And so in this manhed sitty the at the right hand of god. Seleuciani did deny
that Christ in his flesh did sit at the right hand of god but the Christianes
belyue the scripture. It is the nature of a co^tencious, arrogaunt and prode
heart to take out of the scripture some souch propositio^s assound for there
purpose, to defend a wrong opinion, thowghe the meaning make nothing at all of
there part^ And then they have none other word in there mouth, but the holy
word of god, the plain and manifest text, the holy ghost is the best orator
of all, noman can speak more plain then he. He have he most apt and
convenient words to express his mind with all. And when his wrong conceyuid
opinion must be defendid, he s^ttyth the words of the scripture in the ffore
ffrount against his contrary, he clea uith fast unto the letter will admyt no
interpretacion but as he pleasyth, no collaction of places, he caryth not
whether it agree with other places, so the word sound for his purpose. Which
has been the destruction of many ffamous and excellent clerks, as Ishall
repete the names of afew, to scole the Christian reader in the fere of god,
for it is not, lerning, nor wit, that preseruith the faith of a Christian man,
but gods singular graces, which must be daily prayed for that by affection he
embrasse none opinion, what men so ever he is fanty sid un to. But say with
David turris fortitudinis nomen dei. Antropomorphitae^ Said that god that made
man was lik unto martall man. And tok occacion to Err by these words Genes. 1.
faciamus hominem in imagine nostra secundum similitudinem nostram and doules
the words without atrope sound even so but thexcellent divines, that knowith
by the scripture what god is and what man is, will straight way perceive that
there is ^ tropo^e, and by the hole undrestond the part to say the soul of
man. Confer not the words of Moses Deuteronomy. 31. with the other places of the
scripture. Pono ante te bonum and uitam benedictionem, and maledictionem, elige
uitam ut uiuas etc. and then were the pelagians doctrine true. Chiliaste by
these words of Christ. I will not drink of this win from heusforth, till I
drink it new in my fathers Kingdom, said that weshuld eat and drink affter
this liefe in heaven. Sabelliam said that god the father suffrid in the ffres
he as well as Christ, and took occacion by these words and like, Ego and pater
unu^sumus, Ego in patre and pater in me Hebionitae said Christ was only man
and not god as the lewis at this present does. By these words, Deus meus,
deus meus ut quid dereliquistime. Heluidius by the words of the scripture isle
taken conceuid awrong opinion of the blessed uirgine Marie. And said she was
mother of more children then one^ Saint Augustine lib. 21. de ciuitate dei
cap. 25. ^^ytith of asort of heretykes that said who so ever ons receauid the
sacrament of Christ's supper, could never be damnid and defendyd there opinion
with these words, Ego s^m panis uiuus qui de coelo descendi, si quis comederit
ex hoc pane, uiuet in aeternu^ Arius and marcyon with many grear lernid men,
de^endyd, most detestable heresies, by the mystaking of the scripture therefore
no faith owght to be yeuin unto the interpretour that rather intendyth to
stablyshe an Error and false opinion, then to confer place with place, that no
contradiction be found in the scripture, ner any uiolacion of our catholic
faith. Saynct Augustine lib. 3. de doctrina Christiana teachith agodly way to
understond the scripture, he that will ffolow his counsel, shall not lightly
err in Expounding the scripture, he shewith there when the words may be taken
and when they may not be taken without atrope. But the more to be Lamen tyd,
souche is now the condition of all men deceauid in religion for the most part
they will ra^ther, run still the wrong raze they have begone, then godly to
return unto the truith, they will not repent, lest they should seem to have
erryd, souche is the state, and condition of our miserable nature. Where as
there lackyth probacion of the thing that should be prouid, they tarry in the
letter isle undrestond, and turnith them selfs ad peticionem principij. Ask
how the prove and why they make an alteracion of the bread, and what place of
the scripture, prouith there proposicion: They fle unto the text, Hoc est
corpus meum. And for the probacion of the proposicion, they aleige the
proposicion itself. Hoc est corpus meum is the proposicion where upon all this
disputacion and contencion dependith. They must prove by other places of the
scripture that those words alter the substannce of the bread what union is
between the body of Christ and the bread. And how this union is made, and where
the scripture prouith. The sone of good ^o com into the worold to be bread and
how he commyth, and what profeit his body made of bread bringyth unto the
worold, and whether any of the prophets ever prophesid of souch acumming of
gods son into the worold. Show the scriptere that prouith this proposicion,
hoc est corpus meum. To have souch asen seas ye say that the conscience of
those that ye would have b^lyue this your doctrine, may repose here self, in
^rewth and uerite of gods word. Or else noman will be live your doctrine. If
Paul had no better fensid this general proposicion to the Romans
Arbitramurigi^ur hominem iustificari per fidem absque operibus legis. Then
style to have repetid the proposicio^. There would nether lew nether gentyle
belyuid his word: But he confi^mith the proposicion, and disputith the matter
so, pro and contra that he confutith all thargumentes, that seem to repugne his
purpose. These men that would have the bread to be turnid into god an man. Has
none other word but still lik the cock cry, hoc est corpus meum, and will
hyre none other lay, but this is my body so may aman aster the same sorth,
prove our lady to be Joan the Evangelist mother. And say always, what so ever
text of the scripture be browghte against him as Christ said Joan. 19. Ecce
matter tua, say what ye list, the ^e words be true. Christ spoke them, they be
plain, they neade no interpretacion, if any man ask a reason and confirmacion
of the proposicion. He may say still, Ecce matter tua, ye must make no reason how
it may be^ ^t sufficit to have the word of god, the manifest text, reason shall
not melle with the matter, it is amater of faith. And after this sort, aman may
like wyce prove Ioanne the baptiste to be the person of Elias, is not this
ameruelous manner of resoning. When they be asked to prove the proposicion, they
repet the proposicion, that is disputable and so false as they takeit, that
thextreame contrary is true. As the scripture prouith and callith the signis of
the most. Divine and sacrate supper of the lord, bread, and win 1. Cor. 10.
and 11. Who so ever eatyth of this bread unworthily shall be culpable of the bodi
of Christ These words be more plain to prove the bread, to remain aster the
words (as they call them) of the consecracion, then hoc est corpus meu^, ar to
make a metamorphosin of the bread. Now if it be the deuillis sophistry as my
lord callyth it to belyue with the auctorite of the scripture, with the
judgment of reason, and by the consent and agreement of the senses, that bread,
is bread, and that god chay gith not the just, true, and uery body of his
immaculat and glorious son in so little arome as too inches of bread. Then is
the scripture the deuilles sophistry which teachyth to belyue that Christ's
body is in heaven, and bread in the sacrament Act. 1. 3. Mat 16. 1. Cor. 10.
11. This doctrine only hurtyth not the faith of man, But also dishonorith the
dignite of man's creacion where as it was yeuen him to be lord of all the
other creatures that god made Genesis 2. and more to avail in reason. Now by the
malice of man this order of god is peruertyd, and that, that the birds of
thayr^, bestes of thearth, and fishes of the water know to be a creature manne
makyth it his god, and prouithe himself there by to be inferior unto all
other creatures. Which is no small off^nce, the ymayge of god in man, not to
know as mouch in asensible peace of bread, as the bestes unto whom god gave
only the judgment of senses unto. Then has they an other defense for this
wrong opinion of the sacrament, they say it is don by miracle, that the body of
Christ is praesent doutles if I saw the body present, and the thing don
indeade I would confess the same, and that it were agreat miracle to call
Christ's most blessid body from heaven with aword. But now herin consistith
this hole matter: Miracles of god be open, and theffect of the miracle so makyth
manifest the miracle, tkat reason is contendyth that god should do his pleasure,
what so ever reason would attempt to the contrary. As for an Example the blyssyd
uirgine when she hard the messayge of god by thangell that she should bare a
child in here uirginite, it passid the capacite of her intendement and thowgh
reason knew not how it might be, yet sowghth reason to know the means, how it
should be, and said quomod fiatistud, when she was assurid that it should be, by
noman, but by the holy ghost. She let fall reason and belyuid the words of god^
And as she in faith conceuid by the holy ghost the sonn^ of god wounderfully
about the reche of reason. So the son of god made man in the belly of that
blessid uirgine, naturally there incressid, for the space of certain months
and declarid unto reason the fact that was done against reason. So that reason
could not deny but that the blessid uirgine, was with child, and had
testimony thereof by the mother of loan Baptist. Vnde hoc mihi, ut ueniat matter
domini mei ad me Luc^^^ with souch a godly greating; as is confortable for
every Christian, this miracle was shewid after ward unto all the worold, by
thactes that Christ did which prouid him self to be the sone of god. Now mark
althowgh man cannot comprehend which ways Amiracle is don by reason yet must
the miracle be perceauid and knowyn by reason. Thowgh the leper Matt. 8. could
not know by reason how he was helyd suddenly of his diseace, yet perceauid he
right well theffect of this miracle. The Apostoles of Christ that knew not how
so great a Number of people 5000^ beside women and ch^^dren should befed with 5.
loves and too fishys Matt. 14. Mar. 6. Luc. 9. loan. 6. the mi^acle that passid
there reason, was shewid, not only to there reason, but also unto there senses.
So all the worold that was inade of nothing, against reason by miracle is
declared manifest unto reason and senses a^ we see at this day. Now if they
would prove Christ's body by miracle to be present uery god an man in the
^acrament, thowgh reason cannot comprehend how it may be, yet let them show
unto reason and unto the senses that it is so, then men will be live it. And not
before. Let them show me any miracle that god did upon the earth lik unto there
invisible miracle. All the worold seyth the bread remain and no body of
Christ present, yet say they it is there, is god so mouche thennymie of man,
to give him his senses to his destruction. No he has of his abundant mercy
yeuen them to decern, whit from blak, soware from swet chalk from chese, the
gloriouse body of Christ from the sign of a sacrament which is bread. There
miracle in the transubstacion of bread, is asmou^h a miracle as the miracle of
him that says he will make hole amannes blind Iy, and yet the blind man seith
nothing the better. God usith no souche blind miracles. But mad eueri thing for
man meruelously because man should honor him in his works. According to out
faith, Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem, creatorem coeli and terrae. It
agreith as well to make the body of Christ present in the sacrament without his
corporal qualites, as to make agreat fire without het. An other gloss is
there, which Eckius usith to defend the alteracion of bread with all, and says
thowgh Paul call the body of Christ bread, yet it is no bread indead, but the
uery body of Christ, and attemptith to prove his sayng by the rode that Moses
usid in Egypt. Before Pharo. When the rod was turnid into Aserpent yet was the
serpent callid stille arod. This simile prouith nothing, ffor when the text
says, sed deuorauit uirga Aharon uirgas illorum Exo^ 7^ there remaynid nor
form not figure of Arod, but of a uery horrible an ferfull serp^nt. If this
place serve to prove thalteracion of bread into the natural body of Christ let
them show me the form of bread changid, into as natural aman, as therod was
changyd into a natural serpent and then iam content. I will not dispute, of
the name so greatly thowgh they called ffleshe and bludd, bread but they must
make demonstracion of Christ's body unto thexternall senses, as Moses made of
the serpent unto thygypcious. When god called our first father, Adam, because
he was created of the earth. And Adam said by his wief be hold abone of mine
bones Genesis 1^ there was nether Adame that had the form of earth, nor Eve the
fform of Abone. The One was aman and the other awoman. How be it they Kept stille
the name of the thing they were created of. Change the form of bread in the
sacrament and make thereof the form of Aman. Then th^se places will suffer the
manner of speech right well that aman may be called bread if he be made of
bread, as well as Aserpent called Arod because he was se made of arod. But for
asmouch as there is no form of the bread changid in the sacrament, belyue
with the Evangelists and Apostoles that it is in matter and substannce uery
bread, how it apoyntid to an holy use, to be ministrid unto the church of god
in the remembrace of Christ's death. With these words. Christ tok bread and
gave it to his disciples Mat. 26. Luce 22. 1. Cor. 10. 11. These men agree with
them selfs, in the sprit of god, and teachith acertayne doctrine, those that
defend these ma^ses and transubstancion agreyth not with them selfs. And has
nothing certain the one sayt the thing that corruptyd is nothing but accidens,
the other says that it is the uery substannce of bread. Read the book of
innocentius tercius de officio missoe, where as be these words, quod sicut
miraculose substancia panis, uertitur in corpus Christi remanentibus
accidentibus panis: ita miraculose redire substancia prioris panis possit, de
qua generetur uel uermis uel quid aliud tale. Into what substaynnce the water
mynglid in the chalice with the win is turnid se the mind of Clement in the
3. book of the Decretalles it is turnid say he into ffleume. God of his mercy
Deliver his church effrom souche doctrine. Yet have they an other Reason where
with the deceive themselfes with all and other. The pore of god that can do all
things. And of these most holy words: they fframe many a false conclusion.
Be cause god can do all thing therefore Imust belyue, that the bread in the
sacrament is turnid into the body of Christ. I would belyue it, were it not
against his word. Now against his word he will do nothing, a sfull Christianly
says Tertullian against Marcion. Posse deum, nthil aliud est quam uelle; and
econtrario. Non posse idem esse in deo, quod nolle it is thoffice of a
Christian, to know what god can do by the word of god, and not to be curious
to sarche what his absolute pore is. He could save the damnyd souls in hell.
But he will not it were against his word, Non remittetur in ho^ seculo, neque
in futuro. He could have sauyd Adame and all his posteryte other wyce then by
the death of his only son. For August. says lib. 4. de Trinitate. Mors
Christi non fuitnecessitatis, sed sue uoluntatis and potestatis. But he would
not. By the cru^ltie of his death, he would have us to know how horrible athing
sin is before the face of god, and there by teach us to be ware how we fall
into his displeasure, but we be trunkes and in manner insensible, nothing mouith
us to uertew. He is more curiouse, then wisse to sar che to know the thing that
appertaynith not unto him to know. It is the next way, not only to bring aman
out of the favor of god, but also out of his wit, for he that sarchith to
know above the reche of a mortal man shall be co^fundid with immortal glory
of god. Let no Christian heart therefore troble it self with this question
what god can do. But lik a diligent scoler lern his lesson in the scripture,
what he is bound to do. For the scripture, was wroten to lead us unto god, and
unto repentaynceofyle. It was wroten to teach us god and all godlynis and not
to move souch questions as ingendrithe nor faith nor uerteue but contencion and
discord and words with out end. It was wroten to be judge of all men's
doctrine, and to save those that Christ redemid with his precious bludd, from
all heresis and false opinions: therein is conteynid all treuith and uerite. And
better was it with the church ^f god when it was only tawght and instructyd by
it, then aster that any man's decres were browght into the church. Mannis
wisdom, yeuith as mouch light unto the word of god, as alitle can dell yeuith
unto the bright son in the mydde day. Yet condemn Inot the holy fathers,
that has wroteso mouche in the defense of Christ's Religion: But give god
thanks that he had souche organnes upon therth, that would rather dye, then to
see the name of god and his holy word to be contemnid of the worold. And a no
table thing is it to mark the godly fathers in there works where as in the
defense of the truth they a lege not only the scripture. But also the testimony
and Example of the primative church. Not to stablyshe there faith because it
was so usid of antiquite: But because they saw, there elders use the word of
god in the same senses that they did. As Epiphanius wrytithe of one peter
bishope of Alexandriae whom the Tyrannt Maximinus put to death: in this peter's
time there was one Meletius that so wid a false doctrine, and said that every
sin committid was irremisseble. As the nouacians and catharence say this
doctrine so preuaylid that the greater part of the people in Egypt and Syria
belyuid it. Peter resistit not only by the scripture. But also that the
disciples of the Aposteles condemnyd this doctrine for an heresy the lik may
ye read inthistorie of Joan the Apostele apud Eusebius. li. 3. page 60. As Christ
is true and his word true, so has there been always in the church souch as
has folowyd the trewyth, and in that they have wroten trewly we are greatly
edified. To se that they and we agree in one faith, and undrestond the scripture
alike, and use the sacraments as they did according to institucion of Christ
if any error be in there wrytinges we may leave it by thauctorite of the
scripture and offend nothing at all they wrote not to be judges if the
scripture, but to be iudgid by the scripture. Were it not to satisfy the weak
conscience of those that yet be ignorant of the truith (I would not in this
matter of the sacrament rehearse the mind of one doctor because we may so fully
and plainly know by thonly scripture what the supper is and how it should be
usid) and think that souche as has wroten of late days to be the first autors
of this doctrine, that the holy supper of the lord should be acommunion and no
private mass or receiving of the sacrament by one man, no thowgh danger of
death seem to require the same. If souch as be sick will neades receive the
sacrament, let them receive it as Christ has institutyd it, with souch other
as shall be present at the declaracion of his faith. But alon noman may receive
it, thowgh his faith be nouer so good, and the minister never so godly. How be
it boothe the scripture and lik wyce the law ci^ile, does rather improve
thact, then allow the doing of it. In this supper we should follow Christ and the
Aposteles, there doing^s was absolute and perfeyth. Noman for a good intencion
befide the word of god should add any thing to the doing of this supper. Or tak
any thing from it we read not that they celebratyd the supper in any private
house, for any sick person. The words of James seem to defend this religion
cap. 5. infirmatur aliquis inter uos? Accersat presbyteros ecclesiae, and orent
super eum etc. Unto th^se sy^ke people that he speaky the of, he would like
wyce have commaundyd the bread of the holy supper to have been browght, had it
been the manner in the Apostoles time. Saynct paul with many words declarith
that this supper when so ever it be celebratyd, should be don with solemnyte in
the church. Cum conuenitis in ecclesia in quit, Audio dissidia esse etc.
Again. Igitur cum con^enitis in eundem locum, non licet do minicam coenam
edere 3. Number sane domos habetis ad edendum and biben dum. 4. Itaque fratres cum
conuenitis ad edendum, alius aliud expectet, quod si quis esurit, domi edat. It
shall not be prejudicial nor nothing derogat thonor of the blessid sacrament
thowgh it never be celebratyd in a private house nor he that absteynith from
the receiving of hit out of the congregation, nothing the warse Christian man.
intyme past it was sufficient for the people to celebrat openly this holy
supper, and was not usid to be browght unto the sick. Iustinianus imperator.
Con^stitu 57^ unto tharche bishope of Constantinople M^me has these words,
Etiam prisci^^ancitum est legitur. Nulli penitus esse licentiam domi, quae
sacratissima sunt agere, sed public etc. and in the same place. Omnibus
interdicimus, magnae huius ciuitatis habitatoribus, magis autem totius nostre
ditionis, in domibus suis habere quasdam quasi orationum domus, and in his
sacra celebrare mysteria, and hinc fieri quaedam extranea catholice and
Apostolice traditioni co^traria. Sed siquidem domos simpliciter aliqui habere
putant oportere in sacris suis orationis (...) uidelicet gratia, and nullo
celebra^do penitus horam, quae sacri sunt mysteri^, id eis permittimus. This
godly Emperor Raygnid Anno domini 500. whereby it aperith it was not the
manner of those days to celebrat the supper no where but in the congtegacion
openly as the paesah was commaundyd to be don, never part of the lamme browght
unto the syck man. But ^tyn in there congregations as ye read Exo. 12. Number. 9.
where as Eusebi^s lib. 6. cap. 34. Ecclesiastes, wrytith of one or too to whom
the bread was ministrid in there private houses. It was down upon a singular
consideracion. The persons that receauid this sacrament in there private
houses were before excommunicatyd by thauctorite of gods word, and before
there reconsiliacion fell into this danger of death, by sickenys: the deaken
was commaundyd to minister the bread unto them that in the reseauing thereof
they might declare there true penitence unto the church, and dye in the
promeses of god that desirith not the death of sinnerse. In the time of
Cypriane it was usid to give the bread of the supper unto children if it were
yeuen them as a sacrament it was isle. But I cann^^ belyue it grant it were, I
will not follow Cypriane but the institucion of Christ I know that he was but
aman and had his faults, as ye may se by his opinion where he would souch as
were Christenyd of herytikes to be rebaptisid. We should not yet by this
auctorite, leave thexample of the Aposteles. Except it be in souch places where
as the commune ministry of the church is corruptyd, and the sacrament usid
contrary unto the institucion of Christ, there every man may in his private
chamber with his Christian and faithful brothers, commu^icat according unto
thorder of the scripture. As we s^ ^ct. 2, 20. how the Apostoles did when the
Pharisees and pristes of the temple contemnid Christ and his ministry as well
of the sacraments as of the preaching of the gospel. where as the faithfulles
may receive openly the sacrament it sufficith them it is not need to to have it
browght unto the syckmannes bed. For the doing thereof has don hurt in the
church of god, causid many times the pore sick man, to put his hope and
confidens, in thexternall ^act and receiving of the sacrament, and thowght
himself never sufficiently preparyd to death, but when he had rec^auid this
external sign. And thus was thabuse of the blessid sacrament. Men say it is
nether commaundyd, nether for byddin by the scripture that the sick should use
the sacrament, in there private houses. The words of Paul, Ego accepi a
domino etc. with the textes a fore rehersid, shewyth not only how the supper
should be celebratyd, but also where it should be celebratyd. Sufficiat nobis
tradicio Apostolica. Let us conform our selfs unto them as nere as we may.
Would to the lord, that there were no more ceremon^es in the doing of this
sacramo^t or any other in the church then the scripture makyth mencio^ of then
blessid and fortunat were the pore ignor^t people, that now by te and gnaw the
bitter bark and never tastythe the swetnis conteynid with in this external
signs, and no meruell: there curates be as wise as they, the blind leadith the
blind, into ignorancie, souch godly preacheres has there mother the holy
church apoyntyd, to have the charge of those souls that Christ redemid with
his preciou^ blude. Person and uicar, patron and byshope sha^^e wayle doutles
this horrible sin to deceive the people of god of his most holy word were
the yeuerse of bene^ices, so god unto there ^enentes or pore people of the
paryses, as they be unto there dogs and horses it were well. for noman yeuith
his dog to k^pe, but unto him that has skyle how to diet him and to keep him
in breath to maintain his course. To save him he wax not mange his horse unto
him that best can skyle to hand ill him as well in the stable as in the ^eld.
Every thing in the worold is better provided for then the soul of man. God
matiners for the ship. Polityk men for the commue wealth an Expert phisicions
for the body, a pleasant coke, for the mouth. A well practysid captain for
the wart, none in any affers concerning the body shall be admittid unto any
office, but apt and convenient persons the best that may be got: in the
church of Christ it is no matter passyd of who bare office thowghe he know
no more what appertayth to the charge that is committid unto him, then the lest
of his pary^he. They take great pain to uisit the sick and to ministre the
sacraments it were better they never came anere the sick with the sacrament,
except they knew better, what a sacrament meant and could show them gods
promises. Which are not only sealyd, but also openly declarid unto the church
by the sacraments. And to make more open that the mass is no ceremony, nor
the bread there usid, no sacrament of g^des, I will declare it unto the
Christian reder by the scripture that teachith us what the sacrament is and
how it must be usid. That the Christian reader by reason of thabuse contemn
not the thing it self. Thowgh the abuse of sacraments is co^demnid, yet must
we not contemn the sacrament thowgh thabuse of prayer be nowghte, yet prayer
as god commaundythe, is good, thowgh win, make men drouke, yet noman says
win is nowght, ^emoue then, thabuse of every thing that is godd, and let the
thing, remain style. This is the diffinicion of the lords supper. It is a
ceremony institutyd by Christ, to confirm and manifest our society and
communion in his body and blud until he he cumme to judgment. Every word in
this diffinicion is in the scripture, that it is a ceremony institutyd by
Christ Matt. Mark. Lu^. and Paul testifies, that it confirmith the
coniumction, and societe of Christ, and his church these words of Paul
prouith. Quoniam unus panis, unum corpus multi sumus. Nam omnes ex eodem pane
participamus ^. Cor. 10. and that it shall be done till thend of the worold
Paul prouith ^. Cor. 11. Mortem domini annuncia bitis donec uenerit. Now the
manner how it was instit^tid, and how it must be usid in the church. It is
wroten by Matt. Mar. Luc. and Paul in the places aford reher sid. And Paul by
name says co^uenientibus uobis etc. would the supper of the lord to be a
ceremony of a puplik and commune assemb^ance, and would in this assemblance the
gospel to be preachyd, god to be called upon, in the remembrance and ^ayth of
Jesus Christ with yeuing god thanges that he would save us by the death of his
son. Therefore it is said, Hoc facitead recordatione^ mei, do it in the
Remembrance of me, what the supperis. And how it was institutid we se by the
scripture. Now of the other part behold the mass and bring it to the gospel,
then shall thou perceive it is no ceremony institutid by Christ or his
Aposteles. Nether nothing done therein according to the scripture but every
thing contrary unto the scripture. Where as Paul callyth it a communion and
would all the church to receive it under booth kinds. They say it is best to
be apriuat mass and eatyn by one pryst. Paul willith the gospel of Christ
to be preachyd unto the congregation, they mummul and dream a sort of
collectes and other beggary unto dead saynctes as nether profetyth them selfs,
nor other but blasphemith gods holy name. Yet say they it is a godly thing
where as god nether the scripture never meant souch Idolatrye, it is a ceremony
insti^utid by more byshopes then twentye to the great injury of gods wotd. And
thauctors thereof damnyd eternally except they repentyd before they departed out
of this worold, for they nolesse deceauid the people of god then the devil in
paradyse. He was not content to suffer gods commandment as it was ye^en
without a false gloss, ner these members of the devil would not Christ's
church, to use Christ's holy supper as it was yeuen by Christ without there
deuillyshe and detestable addicions yet wicked members of Antechrist, they must
be called the holy church. Thowgh all that ever they intend, is the pest and
destruction of the church, and there religion as contrary unto Christ as
darkenys is to light. And say if there were not souche ceremonies addyd unto
the lords supper as they have inthe Mass people should be prouokid, to no
devotion, nor could not religious^y honor that most holy sacrament, therefore
say they is all these ceremonies addyd. Aprofound reason doutles, as meite for
the matter as can be and as far fet, as he that never wist what a ceremony of
Christ's to stamentis. But as one that never sucked other milk then of a cow
that has caluid full many a thousand Bulls of ledd therefore Iwill set before
thies of the Christian reader the ceremonys of this holy supper conteynid in
the scripture and the signification of the ceremony not ffaynid of my brain,
but by thexpresse words of the scripture and so teach the Christian to love
the ceremonies there expressid, and to detest the blind ceremonies of men.
Christ the same night that he was betrayde unto the lewis sat at supper with
his 12. aposteles and among other godly talk in his sermon unto them he said
that one of them should be tray him Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Christ that knew thart of
all men saw the treason that Judas had wrowght against him and knew that he was
at a full point with the jews, to deliver him unto them the matter was ffully
concludyd upon, and money receauid. This wicked man, was not yet so far paste
but there remanyd place of indulgence and for yeuenis or else Christ would
never have admouyshyd him so many times: because god hatyth sin, he
admouishid ludas in time to repent. But as awyckyd person he contemnyd all
admonicions, desirid to finishe his treyterons purpose, and after that he had
eatyn of that holy supper, he depertyd out of Christ's company, and with all
dil^gence sowght how to have his admonitour slain. Joan 13. 14. declarith more
at large Christ's words and factes at this supper. But these words of Matt.
and Mark. Shall admouishe the Christian reader what ceremony owghte to be usid
in te church before the use of the sacrament. What te minister should do and
what the rest of the people should do. The ministers office is to make a solenne
sermon, to admonyshe every man of his deuty and office toward god, and to
exhort all men unto godly and unfaynid repentaynce. The peoples deutiis every
one to prove and examine his conscience and faith, and so to eat of the bread
and to drink of the win as Paul teachith 1. Cor. 11. And so to mark the word
of god preachyd against sin as thowgh god himself spoke it. And remember
that when Christ said unto the Aposteles that one of them should be tray him all
were amasid at these words, and with sorrowful countyna^ce the one beheld
the other with great fere who it should be they hard a wounderfull sine named,
every one examinid his own conscience, whether it were culpable of any souch
sin or not^ and with fere demaundid who it should be this act of the Aposteles
declare what every man's office is that cummith to the sermon, where, by the
word of god sin is accusid to examine his own conscience, and se that no
souch sin be in him that god condemnith by his word. If he be culpable to
repent from the botom of his heart, and desire for yeuenis. But now adays when
sin is rebukid, ffew men entrythe into there own conscience, but rather into
other mennis. Suppo^^th that the word of god rebukith the sin of nthers and
not his, or els^ he iudgyth himself to be no sinner where as ^uery man has
abundannce and to many, if he knew himself well, and souch horrible fautes as
decerue eternal death. A good conscience will be sone pryckyd at the name of
sin, and be ashamed that he has offendyd so mighty alord, and aferd also of
his judgments, and diligently amend his liefe. The conscience destitute of
gods fere passith not adele of the word is mouid nether with fere ner with
love, but contemnyth booth god and his worde^ as we may se, by Judas, not only
this sin of obstinacy and contempt of gods admonicions unto penitence. But
also uery Hypocrysie, as raynith now adays over all the worold, men associat
themselses in to the company of souch as fere god, cum unto the sermones to
hyre gods words, and be nothing the better they amend there lief nothing at
all. They say it was a good sermon, the man spoke well. But what a uaylith it,
that he spoke well and the herer to lyueyle. What am the better that god and
his word b^^holy, or an other man uerteus, except I transform my^^yleliefe unto
commandment of god and live (...) nestly nothing at all. They yoies of Abraam
Isaac and Jacob in heaven appertainith not to souche as know only the faith of
them. But unto souche as obey the co^ma undement of god as they did. Man must
give place to the word of god, when it is told him, and refrain from all
things repugnaunt unto the word, to promote the word that gods Kingdom may
raygne upon therte. Who so ever prechyte it, hyrith it prechid, or permittith
it to be preachyd, except he follow it, nothing auaylithe him. Those
tescripture declarithe to be blessed that work the word, and have there
medicacions in the law of god the sermon must not be hard only for to know god
but also to ffolow god in his commandments. Beati immaculati in uia, qui
ambulant in lege domini Psalm. 110. Beatus qui in lege eius meditatur die ac
nocte, Psalm. 1. thus with an holy sermon Christ preparyd the hearts of his
disciples unto the holy supper, and not with saing of mass. He exortid them to
patience. And to contemn the worold, the one to love the other and the one to bare
(...) thinfirmites of thoter, read the comfortable sermon of Christ from the
13. of Joan. to the 17. and then I make thy conscience good Christian reader
judge, which is the best ways to prepare the wrechyd and sin full man unto the
supper of the lord. And which of booth is to be preferryd a sermon as Christ
usid and his aposteles. Or those uile ceremonies that the bysho^es has
browght into the church every man baryth (...) other in hand that he louithe
Christ and doothe ack^^lege him to be wyser then man. It apperith not, for if
they belyuid as they say, they would not leave his holy testament seatyd with
his precions bludd, and follow the supersticion and idolatry, that the
testament co^dem nithe. This holy sermon should prepare the hearts of souche as
purposid, to communicate with the precious body and bludd of Christ, lest they
receauid this holy sacrament unworthyly, to say with out penitence and the fere
of god. For althowgh sin of his own nature be detestable and condemnyd by
god. They that without repentaynce receauith this sacrament aggreuat and doble
there sin be cause without condign honor and reverence contemptouslye
receive the body of Christ. After this preparacion unto the sacrament. Consider
the ceremony it self without all mennis addicions only prescribid in the word
of god, and thou shall perceive the action and doing of the supper preche unto
thy senses faith and penitence. Christ took bread gave thanks unto god, brake
it and gave it to his disciples sayng take ye eat ye this is my body, that is
yeuen for you. Mat. 26. Luc. 22. Mar. 14. 1. Cor. 11. The eris of the
Christian hyrith that the body of Christ was yeuen and his bludd shed, for his
sins. These words and the breaking of the bread between him and his
Christian brother, does certify him that the ire of god was greatagaynst
sin, that would not other wyce be satisfied, then by the death of Christ his
only son, No godly heart can judge sin to be lightyle, that was purchyd with
so meruclous a death and inestimable price. The calamites of man be great and
his misereis wunderfull as we daily se. Sickenis poverty, exile bauisheme^t,
war not only in the filled with our Ennymies^ But also at home with all uertew
and honesty, discord, debathe, contencion and stryffe between them, that should
be in most peax and concord. Yea daily war in every mannys conscience betwyne
uice ad uerteue. Loost of gods. And loost of ffrendes, the greatyst loost of
all loostes to be robbid of the true word of god. All these be sacraments and
signs of gods displeasure and ire against sin. And we arr troblyd and
afflictid with the se miserys to admonish us of gods judgment and augre for
sin. But the testimomye of all testimonies of this great and inspekable ire
is the son of god, sweting tyres of blud, contending with the justice of god,
and fighting against the devil ad sin only got the uictory by death. He
that is not mouid, nor ferd with this thowghtes of gods ire and the death of
Christ, in eating, and receiving the sacrament undrestondith not what the
sacrament meanith. Now except Christ should cum down from heaven and die again
before our faces his death cannot be more lyu ely expressid, then it is in the
scripture, he knew what ways it might best be kept in remembrance that suffrid
the death in his own body, and shewid the manner of this ceremony himself,
and bid them do the same in the memory of him. Christ preachid a sermon brake
the bread and delivered the cupp unto the hole congregation Matt. 26. Mar. 14.
Luc. 22. so did Paul 1. Cor. 11. and then gave thaukes unto god and aydid the
pour 1. Cor. 16. and this was the memori of Christ's death, and unto this hole
accio^ and ceremoni of the supp must these words be referrid, h^c
quotiescunque feceritis in mei memoriam facietis. And not to the liffting upp
of the chalice over the pristes hea de as it is usid in the mass. Christ
commaundyd this ceremony to break the bread among the hole congregation, that
by the doing thereof the might return unto true repe^taynce and think when they
break the bread and drink of that holy drink, that as they break the bread
and drink of the cup, so it was there sin and there fathers, that causid
Christ to dye. This ceremony is godly and thus does the scripture permit to
interpretat the doing of the supper, and not to break the bread secreatly with
per eundem dominu^ nostrum Christum filium ^uum etc. as they do in the mass.
What neade has the prist to break his cake at all if he mind not to depart of
it to his neighbor, he might eat it hole as well, it is but an Apyshe
contrefeting of Christ to make good the thing that is nowght. Because Christ
and Paul diuidid the bread unto the hole church as Acommunion, they will
diuid it in there private masses, thowgh it be isle don yet has it a certain
show unto the unlernid of uer tewe. Is not Christ well ffolowyd godd Christian
reader of these men^yes hardely. there mass and breaking of bread as like
unto the blessid communion of Christ's bodi and pr^cious blud, as uice is unto
uertewe, and false supersticion unto true religion. The mass is no ceremony of
Christ's supper. But a uery prophanacion of Christ's supper. ffor this is a
true and certain rule all ways to be had in remembrannce. No ceremony has
the nature and strenghe of a sacrament, when it is not usid as the word of god
teachythe, but contrary unto the word of god: and to an other end, then the
word of god assignithe it. The ^ewis and the turks does use at this day
circumsicion, yet is it no sacrament. This ceremony pleasithe not god, but it
is a wickid supersticion damnid by god, and don contrary unto the word of god.
Lykwice the mass where as one receauith the bread and win, the baring about
of the host in prosession^ Keeping of it in the box. Doutles it is not a
sacrament of Christ's most holy body, but a prophanacion of his holy supper.
For of Christ's ceremony it was said. Accipite and ma^ducate, take ye and ete
ye, it agreyth nothing with a sacrament that they do. They have not asmouch as
one place of the scripture that speaky the of a private mass, baring it about
in prosession or Keeping it in the box. Beside that they apply it to an other
end, then it was institutid for and make it of no lose ualew then the death of
Christ, who ons for all sacrificid himself for sin upon the cross Ebre. 9.
10. They cannot tell what this word offerre meanith. When they say they offer
the son of god. It is a great matter to offerr him, it is to acknolege thire
of god against the sin of the worold, and to submit himself unto this ire.
And to be amediatoure between god and man kind, and likewice he must enter the
holy of holynis unto god. Therefore it is said Hebr. 9. Per proprium sanguinem
intrauit semel in sancta sanctorum, aeternam redemptionem inueniens, also: Qui
spiritu aeterno seipsum obtulit inculpatum deo. It is an horrible heresy to say
that Christ is offrid in the mass for sin. Christ ons offrid himself, it is
our office to confess and acknolege, that only oblation ons offrid and to
beliue that by the uertew of it god is pleacid only and all our lyffe give
thanks to god for it. Let the godly people consider these things, and conform
them selfs unto the example of the primative church, and let the new
massinges goo. I know that many men, gatherit out of the scripture many places.
To defend this here sie of the mass. But it shall be thoffice of every godly man
diligently to decerne and judge, notha ac adulterina testimonia a ueris. The
manner of the Aposteles conserning this holy supper is best to be obseruid.
ffirst in the church there should be rehersid, some godly lessons out of the
scripture in atong known. The people instructyd with an holy sermon, not out
of the ffestiuall nor lege^da aurea. But out of the holy bible. Then should
there be commune prayere. ffyrst for remission of sin, and the mytigacion of
the pain condign for the sin ffor althowgh these too concur to gather
remission of sin, and delyueraunce from eternal pain yet does god many
times, punish the transgressors with wounderfull afflictions in this liefe,
as it may be seyne by David, and Manasses with other and to be short what
troble or aduersite so ever we see in this world they be sacraments and
signs, that god is displeasid with our sins, how be it the prist or
minister has no pour to bind man to do this or that, to say this prayet or
that prayer his office is only to show by the word of god gods justice against
sin, and gods mercy in Christ to souch as repent and commyt the rest to god.
Who some time punishith in this worold, and sumn time punishythe not. It is yet
the custom of thold church to excommunicat souche as were commune adulterers,
couitous per sons 1. Cor. 5. Idolatres, blasphemer, slaunderers. Dronkerdes,
and extorsioners and souche as for fere denied the gospel of Christ. Except
they, did open penitence. Which was accommendable use and godly act. don to
give other men fere lest they should commit like offense, also it was agodd
exploracion of the transgressors conscience whether his penitence were true or
faynid. But ye must undrestond that this act and discipline of the church, is
but an act polytik and civil to souche as has professid to live in the
commune wealth of Christ's church in an order lest that the uicious liefe of
the person should be aslaunder unto the word of god, this open penannce
apertaynith not unto the conscience or remission of sin before god, which is
don only for the penance of Christ. Therefore the church must be diligently
intructid of the doctrine co^serning remission of sin before god. It must
know the differaunce between the remission of the defaulte, and the remission
of temporal pain in the which god would many times his displeasure should be
known against sin, as in the pain of David and Manasses. There is no church
can be gouernid without this discipline for where as it is not, there se we, no
godlynis at all but carnal liberty, and uicicious liffe. As in the commune
wealth where a thiffe is as mouche estimid as a true man, a brawler and breaker
of the peace, as an honest citicyne, for a conclusion where as uertew is not
commendid, and uice punishyd, the commune wealth shall sone com to confusion.
They Will doers were all ways punishid and bauishid the company of the godd, not
only among Christian princes and in the law of god 1. Cor. 5. but also among
the greeks and Etnyckis souch as co^mittid murder and incest were
exco^municatid. And lost not only there offices in the commune wealth but were
put out of the company of all honest men and markid with a sign in the upper
uestement, that all men might know him to be as he was aman to be auoydid, and
none to eat nor drink with him, as long as he bore that sign as it is to be
seen by Orestes, peleus, Antilochus. And Adrastus that came unto cresus with
the sign of his transgression they had also there execrecions and curfis,
against these malefactors, and transgressors of honesty. As Phaenix declarith
in Homero. Propter stupratam coniugem patris co^tra se diras recitatas ess^.
These things were usid of antiquite that men should the more depely think upon
the greatnys of gods displeasure and ire, against those that had offendid and
by that means the more to abhor from souche abhominacion, the gentiles that
never knew god, keep the religion of there ydoles and reuengyd the
transgression and uiolacion thereof better then the Christianes. Would to god it
were more diligently locked upon. Vice more punishid and uertew more extollid.
After this prayer for reconciliacion unto god ffolowith. Prayer to op^ayne the
protection and defense of the holy ghost against the devil the worold and
sin and that it shall pleace god to govern every man in his uocacion to do
the will of god and not there own wills then to pray for the goueruers of the
commune wealth that they may govern and extol the word of god, and defend
justice, the^ for the afflictid church of Christ, that god would deliver his
people from the Ravening woulu^s of Antechrist and give then true pastors and
prechers that would study to gather to gether the fflock of Christ so miserable
dissipatid and separatid. Then for those, that be ignorant of the truith that
god would grant them grace to be sauid in Christ with his church. More
auaylith this prayers unto god then many thowsandes of men of war to defend
the church and common wealt of Realms. As it may be seen by Moses when he
prayed, the church of Isreal preualyd. When he seafid it was put to the warst
by here Ennymies. There is not the poueryst in any Realm nor most weak
person but may profit the common wealth where he dwellith uery mouche. And
healpe to bring it to the end and perfection that the commune wealth was and
is ordeynid for. Thowgh he be not able to fight in the filled against man, he may
fight at home by prayer against the devil, that mouith war and sedicion to
destroy the commun^ wealth. Thowgh his uocacion be not to barerule in the
commune wealth, yet may he pray that god give graceto souch as Rule, to rule
well, as the common wealth is commune for all men, so may all men profet this
commune wealth, if they have the knolege and fere of god. Thus meant Paul 1.
Tim. 2. where he exhortid unto prayer and intercession with yeuing of thanks
read the place and mark to what end they should pray. To obtain thend of the
commune wealth and that by express words, Vtplacidam ac tranquillam uitam
degamus cum omni pietate, and honestate etc. But hownegligent men be in this
behalf all the worold seyth. I impute agreat part of this fault unto
ignorancie, that people knowith not how great and difficile amater it is for a
prince and gouerner to rule godly in his uocacion. Nether how great a sin it
is to be unmyndfull of souche gouetners in the commune prayers of the church
then aster these prayers and inuoca^ions there should thanks be yeuen unto god
for all his mercies. Then the words of the supper r^hersid, and the sacrament
distributyd to as many in the church as would receive it, and demaun de to
receive it, so with th^kes yeuing and distribucion of souch gods as god has
yeuen unto every man for the power to depart, with loy and tranquillite of
conscience. This is the ceremony that is a sacrament of Christ's holy body and
bludd expressid in the scripture and the auctor hereof is Christ himself. Amore
godli and religious thing cannot be deuisid, as ye may se by thauctor of it,
and by the diligent writing thereof by the Evangelist and Aposteles, what should
cause the people to leave this holy thing where of we be assurid that it is good
and godly, and to use amasse, that has no certain auctor. Grant it were not
yleas it is of all great yles the warst, yet who would for sakathing certain
and most religious, for athing uncertayne, and supersticious inuencion of man.
Use the sacrament with the same ceremonies, and no more then be expressid in the
new testament as Christ did, and it shall pass all the Masses that are orb to
be said in the worold. Thexternall use thereof where as faith is, may succur an
inward and secreat desperacion of Atroblyd conscience, so that the mind be not
de^titute of knolege. Those that to mouche fere and tremble at gods severe and
rigurous iudgwent. Knowing that sin merytithe eternal death, the pore
conscience thus afflictyd by the means of the devil, and horror of sin,
takyth not as great hope in the mercy^ of god, as fere of his justice: is borne
in hand that mercy nothing auaylith, but by justice to be eternally damnid.
Against souche imaginacions, and perilous te^ptacions auaylithe greatly the
ceremony and use of Christ's supper. For as man is by his senses drawyne to
accomplish ^hact of all inward and secreat conceuid mystheiffe and sin,
where as the senses find external matter and sensible occacio^ to satisfy the
will that willithe nothing but sin, so where as a godd opinion is co^ceuid of
god in the heart, the judgment of man perswadid aright that god is a merciful
god and will pardon every sin thowgh it beneuer so haynouis in Christ, the
will that with great difficulty consentith unto this assurid promise of god in
Christ, is the more constaynid to obey the knol^ge of faith, because the mind
is not only inspirid by divine operacion of gods sprit that his sins be for
given, but also by thobiect representyd unto thexternall senses to say the
doing and celebrating of this holy supper where as the uery woeful, and cruel
tragedy, of Christ's death, is set before the senses with breaking of the
bread, and drinking of the cup, declarith that uerely all hope of salvation,
were paste remedyles, were it not for the pains, trauelles, death and
bludshedding of Christ where withal he satisfied the ire of god, brake the
prison of eternal death and sed man at liberty, and lest this thing ons don
by Christ should fall into oblivion and out of Remembrance, most diligently he
himself show id the manner and ^orme how hewould his church might best be kept
in mind of this inestimable benefit, gave and institutid this holy sacrament to
be usid for the consolacion of the fidel^s till the woroldes end. And why should
any man take upon him to change the testament of him that was so m^r^ifull to
die for us, and of souch wisdom, that heaven and earth and all other creatures
were creatures were created and preseruid by hym^ Truly as he would no man
should take upon him to change thorder of any thing that he has made, not to
apoynt the sone for the night nor the moon for the day, the Earth to bringforth
the fiishishe of the water, and water the fruit of therte but every thing to
remain in thorder and state as he appointyd unto them in there first creation.
So noman owght to melle in the blessid sacraments, to pervert any order
institutid. By god, or say this is godd to be addid, and this tobe taken away:
for there imaginacion, to deck aprist with so many uestementes, and souch
othere detestable pompes and Iuday call apparellis as is in the mass, and say
it is to the glory of god, take the holy communion from the people, and let the
prist make apriuate mass thereof is it not asmouch to say as Christ was a
foul and knew not how to celebreat the ceremony that representyd his own
death with condign honor and reverence? doutles it blasphe mith god. For as
he said these words, and would noman should add nor diminishe any thing unto
them. Germinetterram herbam uirentem. Reptificent aquae reptile animae uiuentis
Genes. 1. And as he said unto Abraam of circunsicion Genesis 17. unto Moses of
Pe^ah Exodus 12. gave the sacraments and how they should be usid for ever as he
had prescribid, Abraam ner Moses who were of marvelous and singular holinis
never addid one lot unto the fforme prescribid of god, they know they could use
a sacrament with no more religion, then when they obseruid institucion of the
yeuer. All the prophets that were after Moses time. Were as doctors and
interpretours of Moses law, yet never among them all none that addid or
diminishid any thing unto the sacraments. We have a greater teacher, in our
church then Moses was^ Christ himself. which gave us his sacraments and the
manner how they should be usid, the Aposteles and Evangelist, that be the
interpretors of Christ's mind and pleasure, nether in the gospel, ne in the
Epistoles, never changithe one lot of the sacraments, but usid them as Christ
commaundid. Souch now e day as turn and change the sacraments from torder
yeuen by Christ Makith Christ inferior unto Moses, The gospel unto the law.
And the church of Christ unto the church of Moses. And declarith them selfs
to be more contumelious against the^ the lewys against the law. Every lew knew
right well that there sacraments were sufficiently prescribid and tawght unto
them by the express word of the scripture. These massers say that they can
amend the form that Christ gave, and celebrate the supper with more religion
then the scripture teachith. And of a communion they make a private mass. And
defend the same as athing of all things most holy. Doutles if there sayng be
true and there mass of souche holynis as the make it of, we, ar little be
holding unto Christ. That he would not his church should have the use of the
sacraments, plainly known by his testament as the use of the sacraments unto
our fathers we re knowyn by the law, ffortunat then were those that were of
thold church before Christ was born: for they were certain of there ceremonies
and sacraments by the express word of god, which cannotlye, but we in the
time of the gospel as they say must belyue the doctrine and tradicion of man,
and obligat booth body and soul unto the same, as unto a treuth infallible,
and prefer it before the word of god. For where the word says one thing they
say an other. The scripture that affirmith the supper to be a communion, they
say it must be apriuat Mass. Christ said, Bibite ex eo omnes. And so said
Paul 1. Cor. 11. they say the one kind is sufficient for the people. Had any
doctor amu^g the Iewis usid souch Ablasphemy against the law of Moses, the
people would not have browght the doctor unto the scoles to have disputid the
matter, but before the judge to have had sentence of death against him, that
they might have slain the blasphemoure with stones. Unto us that be Christians
against Christ's law they may say what the list, and have good thank for there
labor. Better ear is given unto the word of man then unto the word of god.
Atale of an old tubbe, better hard then a godly sermon of the new testament.
People could never have binne browght unto this contempt of gods truithe had
not the devil, and the deuillishe laws of bishopes takin the word of god from
them wherein only is declarid the will of god unto us, what-is godd, and what is
isle, what to be chosen, and what to be refusid. A thousand times more
ignorauntar the Christianes of the gospel and of the hole scripture, then the
lewis. Never met I with one lew but he could reason familierly in any book of
the old testament as agreat lernid man among the Chtistianes in any place of
the new testament. Yea and likwice some in the new testament also, and by the
New testament with many strong arguments can prove the mass and other
ceremonies to be against the new testament. To the great shame of Christian
men that thennymies of Christ, know better what is contey nid in the new
testament, then those that has professid Christ, and no meruell for every lew,
is able to instruct his own family in the bible and beginnith to teach his
child the 20. chapter of Exodus as son as he can speak Aleph. God of his
mercy turn them to his faith, and then I dout not they will more auayunce gods
gospel, then we, and better keep the word of god in honor with out false
gloses then we. I desire those that defend these Masses and other robbery of
gods glory in the church. To make some book of every thing that they defend.
Show who was thauctor of there doctrine, and first browght it into the church
in whois days and what year it was don. And prove there book to be good, by
the word of god only, or else noman will be live it. And that there use of the
sacraments is prescribid unto the church by the word of god. And tell us what
difference is between a sacrament and the thing signified by the sacrament. Or
whether the sacrament and the thing meant by the sacrament be one thing, and
what I should iudg^ of the signs and what of the thing signified by the sign^s.
The scripture teachith other wise then the popyshe church teachith of
sacraments god said unto Noe that the Rain bow was a sign of the conu^nant
between god and him. Genesis 9. sic Abrahamo de circumsicione. Et erit leooth
foederis inter me and inter uos Genesis 17. de Pesah Exo. 12. and erit hoedam
uobis in signum. Eterit uobis dies ille in memoriam, and celebrabitis eum, pro
festo domini in generaiiones uestras. Now let the Christian reader mark our
sacraments and the words that Christ usid when he institutid them and se, how
that Christ alludid unto the sacraments of thold church, he said that pesah
should be celebratyd and the day of that solemnite kept holy as a memory, of
gods mercyedon in Egypt when he killid by his Angel all the first be gotten
in Egypt and sauid the Israelites. So says he in the Evangelists by his holy
supper. Do it in the memory of me. And paul says as many times as ye do it
ye shall declare the death of the lord till he cum, they of thold time kept in
memori the fact of thangell in Egypt and caryd not with them always the
Angel in the sacrament of pesah but thangell when he had don his office
apoyntid by god returnid again into heavens unto god. Souch as be of Christ's
church keep in memory the fact of Christ don upon the earth for the salvation
of the worold by the death of his innocent body, and does not Carry a bout in
the sacrament the body of Christ itself, for that after xl. days ascendid
into heavens after that it had don the office that god apoyntid it unto, to say
to be slain upon therthe, and then to rise again and be exaltyd into the
unspeakableloys of heaven. As Paul says ascendit ut adimpleret omnia Ephe 4.
he ascendyd to fulfill all things, not with his corpor all presence as some
men say, but to fulfill all things that was wroten of him in the law, the
prophets, and Psalms and to leave us a sacrament of his blessid sacrifice in
the church, to be ameroy of that glorious death until the woroldes end.
Which sacrament is not abare sign and token of his death only, as many men
imagine as the picture of hercles, is hercles. Or the imayge of Iubiter, to be
iubiter. But I put asmouch difference between the sacraments of Christ, and
all other signs and tokens not apoyntid for sacraments. As I do between the
seal of Aprince, that is annexid unto te writing or charter that conteinith
all the princes right and title that he has unto his Realm, and the Kings
armis pentid in a glass window. souch seals annexid unto so weighty wrytinges
be no less estemyd, then thole right, title, or Cleme that is confirmid by the
seal, thowghe the matter of the seal be nothing but wax, not for the ualew of
the matter, for too pence will by ten times asmouche wex. But for the use that
the matter is apoyntid unto. And he that would take upon him to deny the Kings
seal in souch a purpose and say, it is but apece of wax it were nolese then
treason and a uery contempt of the King him self. Because the king has
apoyntid that seal to be honorable receauid and reverently usid of all men.
And as the wrytinges sealyd does confirm and declare the right of the honowre
unto all he worold, so does the sacraments confirm thassurannce of ever
lasting liefe unto the faith fulles, and declarith the same to all the worold.
And as the matter, substance, and land itself is not corporally, nor really
conteynid in the writing nor annexid to the writing^ nether browght (when any
matter of contrauersie is for the land) before the judge with the writing No More
is the corporal body of Christ browght before the church neque cum pane, neque
in pane, neque sub pane, neque per panem, neque ante panem neque post panem.
But when the minister delyuerith unto me the thing that is in his pour to
deliver to say the bread and win rehersing the words of Christ's
institucion, the holy ghost deliuerithe unto my faith which is mountyd and
ascendid into heaven the precious body and bludd of my savior Jesus Christ
spiritually, and not corporally, so does the merits of this precious body in
heaven feed my pour wrechid soul upon therthe, and no contradiction or
impossibilite for Christ's body so to do. It may be in heaven and yet extend
his uerteue by the operacion of the holy ghost into my soul by the means of
faith, which at the time of the receiving of this sacrament is in my soul and
out my soul, as the sprit of god is, in every godly heart and out of the heart
in heaven with god, so was god at the creacion of man unto his awnelyknice in
man, and out of man. Yet to make it more plain as the sone in heaven does
extend down his beams, and ligthyn the hearthe. So does Christ's body, by
faith in sprit, expulse all darknis and sin out of the heart mouith not
bodily, but is every where, where faith is spiritually, an at one tyme^ As a
man Remaining in one place, may adresse his thowgh tes into heaven or in to
hell as many times as he lystithe to meditat either the one place or the other. So
Paul exordith the Christian man Ebr. 4. Accedamus ad tronum gratiae, ut
misericordiam and gratiam and axilium opportunum inueniamus, Calling the trone
of grace our sole mediator: to say the peace maker betwe^ god and man. This
body of Christ is only in heaven and no where else, as Io says 1. Epist. 2. so
does August. writ tractat in Joan. 30. Sursum est dominus, and iterum corpus
enim domini resurrexit, in uno loco oportet esse, so does the master of the
sentence alege his words, and not, in uno loco esse potest, as the later
edicion redith. How ffonde doctrine the scole men teachith it is plain.
Lambertus in the sentence innocentius in the decretales. De summa trinitate,
and fide Cath. ca. ffirmiter, and Nicolaus pape de consec. Dict. 2. cap. Ego
Berengarius. This doctrine subuertith it self if men Mark it well. For as soon
as they have confessid the bread to be the essenciall, and substanciall body
of Christ, and the wine, his natural bludd they add, sed inuisibiliter and
ineffabiliter, and non ut in loco, non qualitatiue, ant quantitatiue. So does
Thomas aquinas part 3. Quaest 76. and Lombertus lib. sentent. 4. Distinct. 10.
sophistically dispute the matter. Is it not a wounder that men will not mark
what contradiction is in there words, ffirst the say Christ's uery natural
corporal, physical, substanciall and real body is in the sacrament. The body
that died upon the cross. Was burid that rise the third day, that was taken
into heavens, and yet they make it with out qualite, and quantite, es notis this
ameruelous doctrine to say Christ now hat^ abody, that is nether great nether
small trewly if he have now souche abody as is invisible, without all qualites
and quantites, then had he never upon therth a true body, but a fantastical
body as they make him to have in the sacrament. But I confirm my faith by the
scripture that teachith of his incarnacion and uery manhod Matt. 1. Luc. 1.
Romans 1. Ebr^. 1. 2. 9. 10. Matt. 26. 27. Mark 14. (...) and by all the
scripture and let this ^alse imaginacion of Christ's body pass that they
speak of to be in the sacrament. And would the Christian reader, not to be
mouid, with this doctrine at all. But to set saynct August. against the master
of the sentence, and all other scole doctors be the realistes or fformalistes.
He declarith plainly that no body can be, except it ocopy place Epist ad
Dardanum 57. Spatia inquit locorum toll corporibus, nusquam erunt, and quia
nusquam erunt, nec erunt. Toll ipsa corpora qualitatibus corporum, no^ erit
ubi sint, and ideo necesse est, ut non sint. Thowgh Christ be Absent bodily
from his church, yet with his ayed. Help and consolacion he is present in
sprit which sufficit until the end of the worold, where as we shall s^ his
glorious body in dead really and corporally that now have but a sign and
sacrament thereof which sufficithe to keep that holy sacrifice in memory: and
is profetable so that (...) Christian man be well instructid what differens is
between the sign and the thing representid by the sign, and takythe not the
one for the other as saynct Augustine teachith lib. 3. de doctrina Christiana
ca. 5. 8. and as Paul teachith Roma. 4. interpretating the words of Moses Ge.
17. Hoc est pactum meum. And says that Abraam receauid Sphragida iusticiae
quae per fide^ apprehenditur and says plainly, that circunsicion was not the
alliance between god and Abraam. But the co^firmacion of the promise grauntyd
and yeuen before. And so be all othere sacraments, whether they be of thold
church or of the New callid Sphragides: signs and confirmacions quia sunt
uacalia, uisibilia quaedam and palpabilia testimonia, ac ueluti consignationes
promissionis dei accept, per fidem in Christo. Therefore it shall be necessary
for the Christian Reader to lern be heart what a sign is and to know the
nature and office thereof. Asigne is athing subject unto the senses, where by is
remembrid, the thing signified by the sin. This thing known men must take heed they attribute no more, nor no less unto the signs then is to be
attributid of right. And what so ever uerteue be representid by the sign, yet
must weiudge of the sign according unto the nature of the sign, As in the
time of war if the Captain, either by aword, either by holding upp of his hand
would signify unto the rest of the host when they should march forth, or
retire back it is nether the word, nether the beck of the hand, that is the
marching for the or retyring back. But these signs declarithe unto the
soldiers when they should go back or for the by thexamples of the scriptures I
will make it more plain that every man shall be able to judge aright of a
sign Red the 10. chapter of Number. Where as the childrem of Israel departid
from the desert of Sinai, into the desert of Pharan in war like order, every
man apoyntid unto his Captain, and under what Baner he should. Be every man
that was of the tribe of Judah to be under Nahson the general Captain of that
tribe, and under his baner. Souche as were of the Tribe of Isachar to be under
Nethanaeel and his baner They of the Trybe of Zebu lon under Elyab and his
baner, and so forth as it is wroten in that chapter. Now note what a sign is
in this place a mark or open token where by every man in the host knew unto
what captain and company he should resort and when every man was in his
proper place, the one knew by these signs and banners of what lynayge and
progeny the othere was. Here seyst thou Christian reader, what a sign is, a
declaracion of the person un to what captain and Trybe he apperteynid. The
signs made Noman of the Trybe of Judah but declarid him that was in that ward
to be of the Trybe of Judah. Here is the sign and the thing signified by the
sign well declarid. Now were it isle don to call the banner and sign the Trybe
of Judah and say the sign were the thing representyd by the sign. The sign
therefore of every thing must be iudgid after his nature if it be clothe the to
say it is cloth: if Aman should have made a garment of the baner of Judah, a
sail clothe, or any covering for souch things as were in the tabernacle, they
would have iudgid aright as the thing was and callid it a cote of clothe.
According to the matter where of it was made. When the keys of any cite or^
town be offrid unto temperoure, or prince, as unto the supreme, gouerner
thereof it is a sign and sacrament of the citicens obedience unto the prince to
whom they be deliuerid, but if any man would ask what the sign of this
obedience were, every man would auswer it is a kay, or kays, and not the
sub^ectes obedience under the form of a knay. Or else say that the City and
Citycins be turnid into the knayes or the knays into the Cite or Citicince or
any souch like frace. But they know that obedience is in the heart, and a sign
of the obedience is the knayes. For incase the prince had no better assuraynce
and warrant of the Cyticins obedience, then is conteynid really and
substancially in the keis, they might be ffraude alure him with false hope unto
the gates of the City, and then bolt the gates within side against him, and
not only keep him out of the City, but also by treason put him out of his
liefe then receauid he nothing in the kayes. Like wyce if any man should feign
himself to be the prince of the City and the Cytiens unwares thereof should
deliver the kays and affer the deliueraynce know that he is not there true
prince, well he may keep the sacrament and external sign of there obedience,
but he shall not enter the City any thing the rather. Now with this sign this
country fetid prince receauithe not at all the thing meant by the sign. No More
then he that was of the Trybe of Dan could make himself of the trybe of Judah,
with standing under the baner of sign of luda. They say that the sign is not
only a sign of the thing, that it signifiyth, but also there is co^teynid in
the sign and with the sign the thing that it signifies. That is not so. No
sign insomouch as it is a figne can be the sign, and the thing me^t by the
sign god commaundid the Children of Israel to blow the silver trompetes when
they entryd batell against there ennimies that there by they might remember
that god had not for gotten them, yet was not the mercy of god and there
uictory inclosid in the trompetes. So these signs in the sacraments, because
of gods promis and contract made with his church, ar tokens that god will
give the thing signified by the sacraments. Noma^ therefore upon pain of gods
displeasure should co^te^ne these holy sacraments. Nor noma^ of the other ^t
should judge of the^ more the^ of right may be admittyd, a haid thing is it to
keep the mean. Or else we extolle te signs over mouche or else to mouche
condemn them. souch as make the signs of the sacrament which is bread and
wyn^e god, co^mittidolatry and knoyth not what a sign is the people ar not
only abusyd in this sacrament but also in every other thing usyd in the church
for lack of knolege. the ringing of the belles, was institutid to co^ uocat and
call to gether the congregation of the church at a certain our to hyre the
word of god and to use the holy sacraments. Or else to show when there should
be any consultacion an assemblaynce for matters touching the commune wealth.
The thing is now come to that point, that people think God to be hyghly
honoryd by the sound of the Belles some think that the sound has pour in
the soul of man the ring so diligently for the dead that the break the Ropes
to pull the souls out of purgatory. they say that the sound candry ue away
the devil, and Cease all Tempests. othere say that the sound mouythe and
storyth unto devotion, doutles they judge amysse, if devotion cum while the
bell Ryngith, it commyth not there by, but by Gods sprit, for it is not the
nature of the sound to give it, it may be asigne of devotion, as the comete or
blasyng star, may be callid a sign of gods ire or anger, thowgh the star
of is nature is not to be feryd. But there is an other thing that ferithe the
man, the fere of gods punis hement, so the croing of the cock is a sign of
the drawing nere of the son unto our orizon, it may be also thoccacion that a
man rysith erly in the morning. How be it the croyng of the cock causith it
not. But the businis and affayrs that he has to do, the love that he has to
serve god in his uocacion, or else he would not rise at the calling of the
cock, but sleep as a slothful man until he could s^epe no more. How be it
it may fortune men will ob^ect and say, that these signs that I have spoken of
and the signs of the sacraments ordeynid in the church be not like. All one
concerning the nature of signs, the diversity is by the word annexid unto the
sign, and the use where unto the sign is apoyntid. There are too kindens and
d^uerse sorts of sacraments. And god is thauctor of them boothe. The One kind
apoyntid unto the ministry of the church all ways to be usid in the
congregation of god, and has the word of god and promise of gods mercy
annexid unto it, so that who so ever con temnyd the use of those sacraments
were excludid from the promise of god and also ffrom eternal lieffe of
thesesort of sacraments were too in the church of the Israelitis.
Circumsicion and pesah. Genesis 17. Exo. 12. Of the other sort of sacraments. Was
the arc in the Clodes, the which god, callid the arc of his allyaunce between
him, of the one party, man, and best of the other party Genesis 9. and likwice
the celestial fire, that consumid the sacrifice of our fathers in the
beginning of the worold. Genes. quarto. There was none of these too apointid by
god to be usid in the ministry of the church, as circumsicion and pesah was.
But god at his pleasure when he lystyd, shewid by souch signs his love and
favor unto the yyes of souch as louid him Not with stonding there was no
promise annexyd un to these sacraments of lieffe eteruall. Now in booth the
se sacraments as well those that were apoyntyd, to the minystery of the church
as those that were not. Were none other then testimonys of the promise that god
had mad with them that usyd the signs before the receauid the signs, and the
cause why God would annex these signs unto his promese thowg there be many yet
is this the principal, to admonish him that receauyd them of Gods pleasure
and God will to wards hyme, to excitat and confirm the faith he has in te
promises. To declare his obedience unto God, and by the use of these
sacraments to manifest the living god unto the worold and give occacion to
other for to do the same. Then ar these sacraments, as uery Chains and
synewes to coniu^ge and bind to gather all the members of Christ in one body
whereof he is the head, by the which exercise and use of sacraments, the church
of god, declarith it self, to be deuidid ffrom all other nations that use not
the same sacraments. But beware Christian reader when thou speakist of thend
wherefore the sacraments were institutid, that thou confound not the ends and
take one for the other. For if thou do, thou have ascendid the next gre to
neglect the sacraments Some say the ar but signs of our profession that
discern us from other people. As in time past the Romans were known ffrom
all other Nations by there Apparel. But we must understond that the ffyrst
cheyffe and principaule cause why the sacraments were institutid. To be
testimonies of gods pleasure to words us as Paul says by circumsicion Romans
4. Behold the scripture, and then thou shall se all ways that signs of gods
ffauor we re yeuen unto the faithful, and ceremonies annexid un to the
promise of grace, ffrom the ffall of Adam unto this present day. And as the
promese was renewid, so god gave new signs and testimonys of the promise:
aff^er the ffyer unto Adam and Abell. Circumsicion unto Abraam, because the
promise of salvation was re uewyd and made more open unto Abraam, then unto
Adam. Inimicitias ponam inter te and mulierem, etsemen tuum and semen illius
etc. Gene. 3. now by express words unto Abraam. In semine tuo benedicentur
omnes tribus terrae. Shewid that in his seade all the worold should be blissid.
And when this promese of god unto Abraam, by reason of the long captivity of
Abraames seade in Egypt was like to have been for gothen, and the truith of
gods word little regardyd among the posteri te of Abraam. God sent again new
preachers of his trewith Moses, and Aron, to call this gospel unto
remembrayunce, in semine tuo benedicentur omnes tribus terrae. And with the
restoring of this light again unto the church, he gave like wyce new signs
many a one as the 4. latter books of Moses testifiy the namely the killing of
the ^ame which was a sacrament of Christ's death to cum. What occacions is
there given to mortal man to render thanks unto god, for the preseruaclon of
his church, that when the light of truith semid to be clean put out, he
kindelid it again. After Noe, the preacher of the promise was Abraam. After
Moses, Samuel, David and other, in the time of the Phariseis and Saduceis,
Simeon, Zacharias. Anna and Maria. When the light of the gospel was browght
into the church, there was also new ceremonys and sacraments given to be
signs of gods promise. Baptism and the supper of the lord. The which too
sacraments we have for circumsicion and Pesah, And ar the same in effect with
the sacraments of thold law, saving they signified Christ to cum, and ours
declare and signify Christ to be passid bodily out of the worold. And that the
Elements and matter of our sacraments is chaungid ffrom there. For the lame
that signified Christ to die we have bread and win that signifies Christ to
have died, and as Christ's body was not corporally in the lame, no more is it in
the bread and win. ffor they be sacraments of one and the same self thing,
institutid by god to one and the same purpose, the one to prophecy the death of
Christ to cum, the other to preach and mani fest the death to be past, the one
co^maundid to be Ame mory of the thing done in Egypt, Exo. 12. the other to be
amemorie of the thing don in the mount of Caluary 1. Cor. 11. the memory of
the one was not the thing that was remembrid by the memory no more is the other.
For of things like, must be like judgment yeuen, in the one remaynid uery
ffleshe, the lame, in the other uery bread and win. In the one the judgment
of senses was not repr^he^dyd, no more awght it to be in the other, theffect of
the one sacrament, scilicet Pesah was only receauid by faith and not by hand
deliuerid into the mouth of the receauer, so is the other. Theone had his
promesses, and proper ceremonies how it should be usid by the word of god, and
noman to change the use thereof, so owght the other. For the gospel is as
suffieie^t to teach us all things, as the law was unto the jews, and a
better and more holy minister is Christ of our church, then Mose of the jews
church. The false interpretacion of the Jews corruptid the judgment of our
fathers, as ye may se by the scripture and uehement preachinges of the
prophets, so has the decrees of byshopes corruptid the iudgmen^ of the worold
in our time as ye may se when ye confer there doctrine unto the doctrine of
the Aposteles. The malice of man could not utterly destroy the truith in our
fathers time, no more shall it do in our time Christ has prayed for his
church and his prayer is hard Joan. 17. it shall be upon the earth till he cum
to judgment Matt. ult. thowgh always afflictid and persequutid by souch as
contemn boothe god and hit word. But it shall suffice the servant to be as
his master was we read how he entryd with many afflictions so must every man
that will be sauid Ebre. 11. Romans ^. the church of Christ may welbe comparid
unto daniell setting Among the lions destitute of all humayne ayede and
defense, deliver it out of the cave, yet shall it wander upon the^th as a
contemptible thing of no Estimacion not knowing where to rest here ^ed,
patience must suffer this opprobrie and abiection and when she can not be
receauid as she is worthy into the palyce of the rich, she must be content to
lodge in the stable with Christ among the brute bestes. Yet god Many times
does resuscitat of his great Mercy diverse princes and godly mindyd kings for
the defense of the church, as he did Cyrus and Constantinus with many other.
And in my days it pleacid god to move the heart of the most noble and
uictorious prince Henrye theight of a blessid memory to deliver his subjects
ffrom the Tyranny of the wyckid Antechrist the byshope of Rome with many other
godly and divine acts, which browght the light of gods word into many
hearts. Beseching the eternal and living god. That this our most gracious
and uertewes Sovereign lord King Edward is successor may godly perform the
thing that is yet to be desirid, and leave no more doctrine in the church of
inglond, nor other book to instruct his subjects with all Then the most
godly young prince Iosijahu lest in the land of Judah an Jerusalem. His most
noble acts be wroten 4. Reg. 23. heremouid all false doctrine and Idolatry
out of the church and restoryd the book of the law into the temple, bound
himself and all his subjects to honor and obey god only as that book tawght
Manasses for the time of many yers conspirid nothing but the abolycion and
destruction of gods word, killid the prophets of god and many other godly
persons, in that time of persequucio^ some godd man hid in the temple an
Exampler of gods law, which by divine operacion was found in the raygne of
Iosijahu. Agod act of him that hyd the book and a godly act of the king to
bind his subjects unto that book. He that had sawght all te churches in
inglond before 16. years should not have found one bible but in every church
souch abhominacion and Idolatry as the like was not since the time of Iosijahu,
every where Idols with all abhominacion, and as I perceive by a frindes letter
of mine of late in a Certain church in Inglond, was an inquisicion made for
the bible, by the kings maiestes officers, that instead of the bible found
the leffte arm of one of those chartechouse Monks that died in the defense of
the byshope of Rome Reverently hyd in the high altar of the church, with a
writing containing the day and cause of his death. Doutles a uery sacrament
and opyn sign that they be hypocrites and desemblers, and not perswadyd of the
truith in there hearts. And I trust to hyre that the Kings majesty, never put
his officers to great pain to bring them to Tiburn, But put them to death in
the church upon the same altar wherein this relic was hyd, and burnt there
the bones of the treterous ydolatraes, with the relic, as Iosijahu did all
the false pristes 4. Reg. 23. And the doing thereof should not have suspendid the
church at all, but have been, a better blissing thereof then all the blissins of
the byshopes of the worold, for god louithe those that be zealous for his
glory. But what the cause should be, now that the littell ydoles be cast out of
the church (thowgh the mother of them all be there yet) and yet people be
ydolatres. It is easi to be perceauid. The wannt of the word of god, diligently
preachid. Read the 33^ chapter of the 2. bok of Paralip. Where as the good
king Manasses after his captive in Babylon was returnid ffrom his wyckid lieffe
and restoryd unto his Kingdom, with great diligence, he destroyed souch
Idolatry as be fore he stablyshid in his Kingdom over true all the aulters of
Idols, with great diligens. How be it in the 55. year of his Reygne he
departid out of his mortal lieffe before he could conveniently restore the
book of the law and the true word of god unto the people, so that not with
stonding the kings godly pretense and destroing all ^dolles, Populus immolabat
in excelso domino deo suo 2. Paralipp. 33. Amani^est Argument that it sufficith
not to remove thoccacion ofyle, but there must be given occacion of godd^ when
ydoles be cast out of the church, the word of god solye and only must be
browght into the church and so preachid unto the people, that there false
conceuid opinion may be taken out of there hearts, and taugh te to abhor
ydolatry by knolege, or else will they return again to there supersticion as
many times as they have occacion, give them. The true word, and souch as can
preach it treuly unto then, them will they swear in there conscience never to
serve other then the living god of heaven, as ye may se 4. Reg. 23. by king
Ios^^ahu and his subjects. Stans rex iuxta columnam, percussit foedus coram
domino, quod ambularent post dominu^, and obseruarent praecepta eius and
testimonia eius atque statuta eius, toto cord, atque tota anima ^t
exequerentur u^r ba soederis huius, qu^ scripta erantin libro illo.
Staba^quecunctus populus consenciens soederi illi. When they were perswa did by
the word of god that ydolatrye was naught it was no need to bid them beware of
ydolatrie in the time of Manasse grant father unto this uertewes King
Ios^^ahu, it was no meruell thowghe the people lest not there Idolatry,
because the king being preuen tid by death, could not with the taking away of
the uice, plant uertew as he would have don doutles, But the merciful lord,
^ouche sauid to perform this old kings godly intencion, by the young uertewes
and holy servant of god that was cronid king in the vii^. year of his ayge.
Whois exemple I dout not but that our most gracious King will ffolow. Having
so godly agouernoure, and uertewes consolers, whois yeys cannot be darid with
these manifest and open abhominacions. To have a god of bread, or the holy and
most blyssyd supper of the lords death thus abusid. There is one no table
thing tobe markid in this young king losiahu. When that Hilki^ahu the high
prist, delivered unto the kings secretary Saphan the book of the law that he
had found in the Temple, and Saphan Read the contents of the book before the
king. Mouid with a wounderfull sorrow and heuinis of heart for woe rent his
clothes and said unto those that were present ^o pray ye to the lord, for me,
for the people and for Judah. For great is the furor and angr^ of ihe lord
against us, because our fathers hard not the words of this book and lyuid
not thera^ter. Declaring by these words that all the captiuites, misery and
troble that his predicessours susteynid, was for the contempt and neglectyng of
gods word. The obseruacion whereof is the preseruacion of all puplicke and
common wealths. The uiolacion of it to be the subversion and destruction of
the commune wealth. As it may be secne by those too kings Achas and Ezechias
4. Reg. 16. 18. Ezechias was fortunat in his r^ygne, because he was ayedyd by
god. Achas un^ortunat because he wantyd the ayed of god. To avoid gods di
pleasure, to instruct his subi^ct^s in the word of the living god, and for the
pre^^ruacion of his Realm. Callid assemblannce of all the wysyst of Judah and
Jerusalem came into the temple and being present all the Cyticince of
Jerusalem, the pristes. Prophetis, with, all other great and small. Read
himself unto the people the co^tentes of the book that was found in the
temple. Which declarith, that he would assure his subjects himself of gods
true word, that no false preachere should after ward seduce there conscience
with any false doctrine. So I dout no, but our most uertewes and noble king,
will deliver unto his subjects the only bible to be p^chid in the congregation
and suffer none other mannis wrytiges to be preachid there to seducehis
faithful su^iectes. And say with this noble king Ios^^ahu unto all the
byshopes and pristes of his most noble Realm auferte de te^plo dn^i cu^cta
uasa quae facta fuera^t pro Baal, pro lucis and pro uniuersa militia coeli.
Cast out all uesselles, uesteme^tes, holy water bocket, with placebo and dilexi
for the ded with prayng to ded saynct all other souch trinketes as has
blasphemid the name of the god. And use the testament and souche sacraments
there prescribid, and as they be there prescribid by the word. Oh how great
shall the kings maiestes and the conselles reward be for there thus doing,
they shall triumph for ever with god in souch Ioys as never can be expressid
with tongue or pen with out end in heaven with David Ezechias and Ios^^ahu. The
true preaching of gods word has been so long out of use that it shall be uery
difficile to restore it again, except m^n know the manner of speech usid^in
the scripture. What has browght this blindenis and Idolatrye into te ch^^che
but ignorancie when the bible and true preachers thereof be restoryd into the
church god shall restore like wise souch light, as shall decern every thing
aright, what god is, what a sacrament is, what saynct is and what honor is, to
be yeuen unto them. Where now is souche confusion as the one thing confoundith
the other Prayng unto saynctes as well as to god, Attributing unto the
sacraments and external signs, that, that only should be attributid unto the
promese of god ratified by the signs. Thowgh the sacram^tes godly usid be holy
and godly things, yet be they n^ther god, nor gods promises which thing men
should use as confirmacions of gods promises, and give only thonor unto god for
the graces that they confirm, as they do that inherit there fathers right and
possession, usith to keep well there Euidens and wrytinges lest un to them for
the co^fimacion of there land, yet does they nether honor the wax printid
annexid with the wrytinges as thowgh it were there natural fathers, nor
attribut the yeff^e and donacion of the land unto the writing and seal, but
unto the yeuer of the land, that consirmid the donacion or purchesse of the
land with the seal. The preaching of gods word is of all things in this
worold most necessary ffor the people, and Paul cal^ lith the gospel the
uertew of god to the salvation of all that belyue To. 1. yet is the word of god
of no souch effi cacie, for the words can do nothing but signify and co^ firm
the conscience of him that beliuid. And when I say the word of god is the pour
of god unto the salvation of those that byliue, true it is, when it is
preachid, undrestond and folowid, Hoc est m^ns and medulla uerbi. This is tawgh
daily in our Pater noster. When we say sanctificetur nomen tuum, give grace
that the knolege of thy name may be preachid in the hole worold. Then folowith
the second peticion, Adueniat regnum tuum, the which speakith of nothing but of
theffect of the first peticion. Lord when thou have dispersid the uoyce of thy
gospel into the worold. So govern us with thy holy sprit, that we may belyue
and receive the gospel. He re se we quod spiritus sanctus operatur salutem

contemnid the blessid uirgine to mouch the other, extollid here to mouche.
Equale est ^nim in utrisque his ^^ctis detrimentum, quum illi quidem

there humilite, and paciens, to preach the word of god as they did, to die
ffrom doing of isle as they did, to contemn the worold as they did, they are not
tobe prayed unto, nor to be as god. The memory of saynctes is god if it be
well usid. The right honor of saints is to follow god, by th^re example, as
few men does god amend it, the thing the should do the leave undon, and that
they do is for bidden them by the scripture. When they hyre of the cruel
martyrdom of any saynct, they be mouid with so great petie they put the finger

all these Idolatres that blaspheme thy name, l^u^ prayng unto them and pray to
god to follow them in godly and honest live. Apply the words of Epiphanius
unto eueri thing usid in te church and know what honor thou may give unto it,
thowg the sacraments be holy things, yet not to be honorid for god, nor for
the thing theirepresent, thowgh the scripture use to call the sacrament and
sign the thing representid by the sign. As circumsicion was an under sign
and cutting away of the fore ffleshe thalliance signtfied by the sign, was the
knot and chain where with all, god and Abraam was coplid to gather as ffrendes
the one to be as master, the other as servant. The which conjunction and knot of
ffrendeshyppe only the mercy of god and the consenting will of Abraam knyt and
concludid that Abraa^ should be here of Eternal live before any ffleshe was
circu^sicid. And thus is it with all sacra mentes for they do nothing but
signifi and confirm, the thing that they represent Baptism the absolution of
sin Mat. 3. the sacrament of Christ's body Christ's body^ Thowgh they be good
necessari and commendable to be usid of every Christian, yet not to be honorid
for the thing that theirepresent, as these men teach that would alter bread in
to the body and win into the blud of Christ, every thing is god when it is
well usid. The apple that Eve saw in Paradyse Ge. 3. was godd, how be it not to
be eatyn she sowght here wealth and found here woe, as we most woeful wrecchis
right well perceane, black soap is godd, but not to be laid unto amannis Iye.
The holy sacrament of Christ's body is good. But not to be honorid for Christ,
it is godd to be receauid of the congregation, and not to be massid with all,
we must use every thing to the same end that god made it for or else, the thing
is not usid but abusid. Christ saw before, that false preachers would bring
this Idolatry into the church, to honor a sacrament for god, and therefore to
prevent the I Will. He said hoc facite ad memoriam m^i. A gracious caucat, and
notable caucion, were it not co^temnid. Do it in the memory of me. He saw that
people would offer it as a sacrifice for the ded and the live, and make it
egall with his death. Therefore gave us his word that shewich us it is but
Amemorie of his death Repete the words and Mark them. Hoc facite ad me
moriam mei do it in the memory of me. Too things in this word (memoria) is to
be markyd the one present, and the other absent. The thing present is all the
promises, of god the which the death of Christ has merytid. To say the fruit
of his hlessid passion, receuid by ffaithe into the soole that is a right
instructid what Christ has down for ns. For there is no faith, where as is
no knolege Joan 17. Haec est uita aeterna, te nosse, and eum quem misisti Iesum
Christum. To obtain the thing present in this holy supper, is to have Christ
and all his merits de liueryd unto the soole by the sprit of god throwgh
faith, which eatith nether flesh nether blud corporallye. But fedith upon the
causes why and wherefore, the bodi of Christ should dye and his blud to be shedd,
until souche time as the sprit of god warrauntith and assurethe the conscience
where ffaythe is, that as Christ died for sin, so by cause faith beliuith and
prays for remission of sin the conscience shall not be condemnid for sin.
In this commemoracion and Remembrayunce of Christ's death by faith is
appr^he^did not only atrew knolege and undrestonding of the mystery of Christ's
death, but also the promise of lyffe. Remission of sin and the gyfftes of
the holy ghost which necessarely follow, yth the remission of sin. Of these
too things the one is the light to judge all things aryght. The other yeuith
strenghe to do all things aryght so that this faith delyuerith ffrom
desperacion and all other isle. Aduersus omnia nos erigat, and doceat mundum
uincere. Itaque ut memorate rei memoriam ^ides sequitur: Sic eius rei notitia
memoriam praecedit. The thing present in this sacrament is Christ himself
spiritually, the thing absent is Christ's body corporally. Knolege of the
scripture assurith me off the fact and death of Christ past, and nomo re
present but now is in heaven with the father omnipotent, the spritt of god by
faith makith present the fact past and contendith in judgment with gods ire
upon the merits of Christ's. And as all ways in man's nature is sin
present, so is there all ways aremedi^ against sin present, the which we
apply unto our selfs by faith, and desire mercy for Christ's sake, the
punishment that man has deseruid, the son of god being made man has
suffrid for. And this sacrament is a memory thereof, and not the thing it self.
Thowghe it be the manner of the holy ghost in the scripture to call the signs,
by the name of the thing signified by the sign if we will needs add any words
to make the matter more plain. Let us not abhor from the old terms. Panis est
corpus Christi symbolice, uel sacramentaliter. And then by gods grace we shall
be out of danger of all Idolatry, and like wyce keep the sacraments in there
dew honor and r^uerence. As for these new terms transubstanciacion and then.
Essencialiter, Substancialiter, Naturaliter, Corporaliter, Mirabiliter,
Inuisibiliter, ineffabiliter, in pane, cum pane, sub speciebus panis and uini.
The se be terms that the old church knew not of. They have browght into te
church of Christ great darkenis and to mouch causid the signs of the
sacraments to be este mid. They shall not be contemnit nothing the rather
thowghe there right use and nature be known god for bide that any Christian
man should speak against them. But it is the office of eueri man to know the
manner of speech in the scripture, and to judge according unto the meaning, of
the words and not as they sound only, for then should we make diverse gods
where as it but one. David Psalm. 24. Callith tharke the lord of glory, which
was but a sacrament of gods presence. Tollite o port capita uestra,
Attollimini fores sempiterne, and ingredietur rex rex ille gloriosus. Qui est
ille Rex, ille gloriosus? Do minus fortis and heroes, Dominus uirtute bellica
insignis. Likwice Psalm. 68. Iakum Elohim inquit. Simul atque exurgitdeus,
inimici eius desperguntur, and fugiunt a conspectueius, qui ipsum odio habent.
The scripture is full of souch manner of speech, yeat was not tharke god, nor
turnid into god. But the substance remaynid always, and not douttid there of.
Great meruell is that Christian men knowith not the manner of speech conserning
a sacrament as well as the jews. They had sacraments as well as we, and yet.
Never brawlid about them as we do, and thowghe many superstitions happened in
those days and men put there hole confydence in te external sacraments yet
made they not there sacraments there God as the Christians do, they ffaylyd of
the end, how he it not in the matter and signs. And to declare the matter openly
what we be bownd to beliue of gods testament what it is I would that the
Christian should undrestond, that it was nether circumsicion ner pesa in the
old law, ner baptism, ner the sacrament of Christ's body in the new law no
nether the death ner blud sheding of our somour Jesus Christ it seife that is
the Testament or legacy that god has bequest unto the faithful les where of
Hieremie spakyth capit. 31. the legaci and testament is remission of sin and
lieffe eternal which is promisyd us for the merits of Christ, and this
legacye and bequest is made sure, sealyd, and confirmyd, by the death of
Christ, which the father of heaven acceptyth as a sufficient price for the
purchesse of eternal lieffe. And all the sacrament that be or in time past
has bynne, ar none othere thing then testimonies of this good will and favor
pf god tawardes us apointid in the church to lead our faith unto Christ
tho^ly sacrifice for sin whoys Merits eytendith not only unto us after his
passion from the time that he was promisid unto mann in the beginning of the
worold, Genesis 3. as many as belyued in him were sauyd as well before as after
his passion for he was the Mediator between god and man from the beginning.

and gauisus est, Joan. 8. Patres eundem cibum and eadem escam comederunt and
biberunt, 1. Cor. 10. Abraam, Isaac and Jacob were justified by the faith they
had in Christ's Merits to cu^ and were signs of this only sacrifice to cum.
Joan. Chrysostom. ho melia 55. in Joan. Et Ireneus contra haereses lib. 4. cap.

Saynct Augustine. Tracta. in Joan. 43. does understond by these words diem
meum, as well the day of Christ's natiuite, as the liefe eternal. Ego inquit
non dubito patrem Abrahamum totum uidisse, and that is consonant with the
words of the scripture Lu. 16. where as is declarid the condition of souch as
died in the fay the of Christ before he suffrid, and that they were in Joy and
did not as the worold now for the most part does, bylyue that there
sacraments were of souche uertewe to saw them. They kept them with reverence,
and lyuid in the hope of the p^omese that they confirmid to say the death of
Christ to cum. And we belyue in hope of gods promise for the Merits of him
that has died and is passid out of the worold as it is signified by our
sacraments. Left unto us by Christ in the scripture sufficiently there tawght
how they should be usid and to what end, where with all people that have a godd
opinion of Christ should be co^tendid, and thynk uerely that all the wysdom of
the worold cannot devise a better way how to use the sacraments, then he
has there tawght us, and that noman ever louid his church as well as he that
shed his bludd for the Redemption thereof, and to acertayne us of this love he
gave the testament, and his sacraments where with all we might keep and
preserve his love, were we so gracious to ffolow this book^ and testament only,
and not the dreams of men. ffor the law of god is without faut, and all
imperfection, Man's laws has ffaultes and is unperfeyt, what should move man,
to depart ffrom truth un to lies. ffrom perfection unto imperfection from the
holy ghost in the scripture, unto the lyyng sprit of man. Nothing have they to
ffere the simple man more with all, then to say if this lerning be true our
fathers be damnyd they belyuid not so, and then rehearse agreat many of holy
men's names, who is doctrine they repugne for they iudgid aright of
sacraments. Grant they did not. There auctorite must give place tho the
scripturs And let the Christian reader rather condemn the fact of all men
that abuse the sacraments, rather then to say thorder that Christ has
ordeinid is not sufficient. Hold not with the most part, but with the better,
and acknolege them to be of te better part that use the sacraments as the
scripture teachite. And when they preach so mo^che of there doctors holynis
demand whether Christ was holy or not, and when the say the holy church thus
tea chith Mass to be good. Think whether Christ were of te church or not, and
when the would excuse, the re addicious unto the supper of the lord with there
good and holy intencions that it has been so ordeynid by all lernid men that
has wroten. Demand who is better lernid then Christ or who meant better to
the church the^ he, and if they have more wit to use the ceremony of Christ's
supper then he. Or better wrytith of it then the Evangelists. Who wrytith as
clean against there use as light is to darkenis r^de the scripture well and se.
And rather condemn all men of the worold then to grant that the scripture
teachithe us not sufficiently the use of sacraments, and all other articles of
our ffayth. Let the word of god be the Lantern unto all thy liefe and confirm
thy knolege there by. And then art thou sure Now I will answer unto souche
arguments, as my lord would stablyshe his opinion with all. He says that it
is the First and Cheiffe point of sophistry to make every man thynk of himself
farther then is in dead in him. These words may have diverse undrestonding,
and be referryd unto diverse ends. If, any man unlernyd, or meanly lernid,
would say hewere as. Able to interpretat the scripture, to show the art thereof
open the frase the rof, declare the writers intent and purpose. And refer all
the sentences ad Arguments to the same purpose that thauctor me^t them. And
say he can defend and ^en ^e, the proposityon that the Prophet and Evangelist,
with souch other places of the scripture as may serve to the purpose to confute
all thargumentes ofhis contrary, and say he is able by disputacion to
warraunt, boothe him self and the matter he takythe in hand, what so ever his
contrary may object, as well as a lernyd man exercise of ^o^g time in the
scripture: it were not only the fyrstpoyn^ of Sophistrye. But the ^yrst and
Cheyffe point of folly. I have hard but of ffew men that laboryth with that
uice. But the unlernid glad to lern of him that is lernyd, if my lordme^t a
redress of souch an ille, and tell the unler nyd that it is not possible, to
be as a good adyuine as Augustine, as good. An orator as Demosten^s, or as
well know how to gou^rn the commune welt as Cicero my lords words were true.
How be it they mean an other thing to say he that is unlernid cannot know nor
comprehend the true use of the sacrament^s in Christ's church and what they be
as well as the lernid man, and say it shall be suff^cient for them to trust
untoother men's judgments. This opinion of my lords is not true. As the
commune laws of eueuery City must be known of every man that will be a good
Citicyne so must the commune laws of Christ's church be knowyn of every one
that will be a good Christian. It is not sufficient for a commune wealth thowghe
he that pleadythe at the bar in westemynster haule, know there is nor aught to
be in any Monarchy more then on king and all other to be subjects. But that
the most unlernid of the Realm must know the same, or else he should be iud
gid for a treatour to give souche honor as is dew only to the king, unto an
other person that is not king, and is not god in the church, as well to be
known ffrom a saynct or sacrament of every Christian man as a king in his
Realme^yes doutles and as he that would make a subject the king and so with
toouth and nail procleame him to be king against the hynges honor, and against
all the laws of his Realm. ignorancie could not excuse this transgressour
from Treason doutles. Nome re shall these that procleame and fight so sore for
the God of Bread which is a creature and no God be excusyd from ^dolatry the
king of equite is bound to kill the body of these treatur and god can do nolesse
of his iu stice then kill booth body and soulle of this ydolater if he repent
not. And as noman is permittid to by or sell or to make any other co^tractes in
any Realm for his commodite except in the doing thereof he observe the law of
the land, no more can noman use to bargayne or contract with god for his
commodit^ in te church of Chr^stes, except he obs^rue the laws prescribid by
god. As in a commune wealth all men cannot be princes and go uerners, nor all
men lernid. Yet for asmouche as the commune wealth is the societe an
conjunction of the prince with all his subjects be they of noble parentayge or
of basse lynayge, Lernid or unlernid it is n^cessary that as well the lowyst as
the highest the unlernid as the lernid, know how to live like a true subject,
and not to run always unto a man of law to ask whether it be lawful to
give the same honor unto the kings subject, that is dew only unto the king.
So the church of Christ ia not the assemblance of princes, byshopes and lernid
men only, but of all kind and degrees of people in the worold, and the most
inferior person of te church he that lackyth his senses is bound to know, what
god and his sacraments be, and the difference between the one and the other as
well as the best byshope of the church for as the commune proclamacions of
princes, Conseruing ffaythe subject. on and obedience is not yeuing to one sort
of his subjects but unto all and singular persons of his Realm so is the
gospel of Chtist conserning the articles of our ffayth and the use of
sacraments proclemid unto all the members of Christ, as well as unto one god
said not unto Moses and Aron alone. Ego dominus deus, qui eduxi te de terra
Egypti. Et no^ er^nt tibi dij alieni cora^ facie mea Exo. 20. he would not
Moses and Aron alon tobe ware of Idolatry. But all the church. Not that they
alone should know the word of god but to make all the church to know the word.
Conserning the sacraments every man wos bound to know the use of them as well
as Moses, and to teach there chyldre to know what a sacrament was and how to
use it Exodus 12. Genesis 17. What was the commandment of Christ unto his
Aposteles to teach the lernid to cum to heaven on^y. No he said, Facite mihi
discipulos omnes gentes Mar. ult. he that belyuithe and is bapti^id shall be
^auid he that belyuith not shall be damnyd. How can he belyue well that knowith
not god ffrom a sacrament a true body of Christ ffrom the sacrament of his
body. Mark all the sermones of the prophets and the Apostelles, and they
appertaynid unto all the church and not unto one lernid man of the church.
What lerning is this to say it is the deuilles sophistry that a simple and
unlernid man should not and is not bound to be ascertay ne and sure to know god
ffrom an Idol, and Christ's body ffrom a sacrament of his body as the best
byshope of the worold. Was not ^oseph and the blessid uirgine, as well lernid
troo ye in tharticles of therfaythe as Anna and Cayphas, they had bynne well
assurid incase they had led there faith, after the judgment of the holy church
of the Pharisees, and not known god and his sacraments themselfes by the
scripture. But I will put the Christian in mind of the ffyrst word of his
creed. Which is (credo) Isay I beliue in god which is asmouche to say as it
profetith nothing me that Abraham Isaac and Jacob, or that the Aposteles with
other holy and lernid men belyue. But I must be live the promeses of god and
Imust live godly thereafter. Now poor wrecchyd man, and co^fortles person how
can thou belyue, the thing thou knowist not, thy conscience is a Jacques for
every deuillyshe byshopes decrees, and as they change there law now for
Avarice, now for fere, and now for placebo, so thy faith chayngithe, as
inconstannt as the wind, And yet baryth the in hand that the mother and nest of
abhominacion there uniuersall church cannot lie. When all hystorijs declarithe
that the one byshope never stablishyd the others decrese. Read platina and let
those ffew byshopes that I repet give the occacio^ to lern thy ffayth out the
law of god and let there holy church goo, in the yer of our lord 900. Stephene
the sixth was byshope of Rome and for a private hattred he had unto his
predecessor and benefactor fformosus abrogatid all the laws and statutes that
he made in the time of his being byshope, pluckyd the ded body out of his
sepulcher, cut of too fingers of his right hand and cast them into the ^flud
Tyber. After the death of Stephene succedid Romanus primus, and after him too
orher. Theodorus secundus, and Ioannes decimus. These three disanullid all the
decrees of Stephyne, and restoryd the acts and statutes of fformosus
Sthephanes Ennymie. Alitle after was leo the ffyghe made byshope, and within
xl. days of his inauguracion, is uery ffrend Christopher cast him in to
prison. And he occupied the sea and chair tn Rome for the space of 7. months
and then glad to ffle unto Amonastery as abanyshid man as platina says. Then
came Sergius Tercius, who so abrogatyd the laws made by fformosus, that souche
as were made pristes in the time of fformosus were compellyd to receive orders
again. And took the ded body of fformosus out of his sepulcher and causid it
to be cast into Tybre Ileaue Joan the xi. and Joan xiij. amore wyckid person
never ocopyed that Rome. It were a hole book matter to Name the^ all and there
detestable acts. By these men we may see how little authorite there decrees
should have in conscience of a Christian man. And cause every person to syke
the truithe only in the scripture and not at the hand of any byshope or
byshopes laws. ffor doutles they have deceauid them selfs and other this many
yers god give the^ grace to amend. Account it not apoynt of Sophistry god
Christian reader to what a sacrame^tis by the scripture, know it is thy bound
on dewty for if thou ar with thy preacher in the use of Sacraments, thou shall
be an Idolatre with thy preacher, and Gods Ennymye. Thy preacher was
commaundyd to preach nothing unto the but the word of god as Christ towghte^
Docete ^os seruare quecu^que prae cepiuobis, Matthew. 28. And whether thou be
lernyd or uulneryd as thou louyst thy salvation, see thou be able to satiffye
thy self in a true knolege of the sacraments like wise be able to declare the
same openly apertly and trewly unto thy famyly and howshold. Remember the
commandment of God unto all and singular of the Israelitis Erit quoque cum
dixerint ad uos filij uestri, quis est hic cultus uester? Dicetis: Est oblatio
pesah Ddmini, qui transendit domos filiorum Israel in Aegypto, cu^ per cuteret
Aegyptios, and domos nostras liberauit. The ffathers knew not only themselfes
what the lamb meant. but were bount to teach there infantes the knolege thereof
as theydyd by the word of God would tho our lord Christian men would study to
do the same, ffyrst to know them selfs and the^ to teach there ffamilie by
the Testament. And not to say unto there Children see thy God, knele down
serea and hold upp thy hands. the scriptures reprouith that idolatrye. theach
the lords super by the scriptures, and suffer not thy family to blaspheme God
before they know what god is. And beliue not this persuacio^, that it is not a
Christian man^es of fice to know what a sacrament is as well as the pryst for
if thou do thou makyst thy self gilty of gods ire and displeasure, and
declaryste thy self to be none of Christ's read the 10. chap. of Ioa^ and he
that will minister the sacrament unto the let him say as Paul said to the cor.
Ego accep^ a domino quod tradidi uobis, and know by the scripture that he
says, trewthe trust not his word if thou can not read desire some other to
read unto the institution of Christ and know whether he says truythe or not.
Every man is bound to know the commaun dementes of god, and the works there
of. Now the sacraments be all conteynid in this commandment Memomento ut
diem sabbati sanctifices. How can thou honor the living god and if thou be
ignorant of his law. Was this precept yeuin unto the pristes alon, that they
should only keep holy the sabbot, no but as they by the word of god ar bound to
preach the gospel, and minister the sactamentes, with knolege and reverence,
so is every Christian man bound, to use them with knolege and incase he
knowithe not what a sacrament is and why it is usid refrain ffrom the use of
them for gods promese and gods sacraments must be receauid one way with
knolege and faith. This reason ofmy lords is not godly, for doutles he that
goithe to plowghe all the weke is bound to know trewly what a sccrament is and
how and why and to what end it should be usid as well as my lord. And my lord
with all the bishops and pristes in Inglond shall Lament ffull sore, there
ignorancye, and there blud requirid at there hands, and yet the pour,
ignorant persons excusid ffrom thyre of god noth^g the rathere. The second
reason to stab lyshe thalteracion of bread he takyth of the Nature of ffayth.
Who beliuithe things contrary unto reason and the judgment of carnal senses.
It is true that faith so doothe. As it beliuithe the worold to be made of
nothing: the son of God to be made man in the belly of the uirgine. This we
belyue because the scripture commaundith us to belyue it. But my lord cannot
infer there by that faith belyuithe every canterbury ta le. ffaythe is not a
light opinion groundid upon man but afirme persuacion and constant assurance
stablys^ hid in the scripture. Ebre. 11. it signifiyth not only knolege. But
also firm confidence in the thing knowyn. A^ the Ebrew frase usithe ma^ny
times the word belyue for trust Asre col hose bo Psalm. 2. blyssid ar all that
trust in him. Paul citi. h a place out of Esaias 18. ca. hammaemin lo ^a hish,
qui credit no^ festinet. Likwice Dan. 6. and Psalm. 78. duo synonima
coniunguntur, quia non crediderunt deo, and non confusi sunt in salutare suo,
the examples of the testament likwyce declarithe that faith signifithe
confidence in the promise of god, O mulier magna est fi des tua. Item fides
tua te saluam fecit. Thus doothe emeneh in the Ebrew and pistis in the grease
signify. There for Laurentius Vall. and budeus in Pandct. Iuris ciuilis
callith pistis persuacionem as Quintiliane does. Now if we be persuadyd that
the scripture is true and that ffayth must be groundyd there upon, we must
belyue no alteracion of the bread, but belyue that the bred remaynithe after
the words of confecracion as Paul ^aith 1. Cor. 11. the scripture says it
is a memory of Christ's body, and not the body. The scriptnre says of
Christ's body, ascendit ad coelos, sedet ad dexteram dei patris omnipote^tis,
inde uenturus iudicare uiuos and mortuos, Expedit ut ego uada^, pauperes semp
habebitis uobiscum, meno^ semper habebitis Christ's body is above and nowhere
else this says faith groundid upon the scripture. And asfor that my lord
comparyth souche as trustithe unto there senses and say there still remanythe
bread unto the ffoly of the Epicures that would beliue the son to be but too
foot broad because it semyd no greater unto the Iye. Verily if my lord would
have studid a hole iere, he could not have found amore apt and propre
sim^litude to condemn the wrong opinyon that he defendithe, nether better have
accusyd his own igno rancye. The Epicures by reasone of the great distayunce
between the zodiac and the earth could not judge the son as bygg as it is in
deed but folowyd there senses and said it was abyg as the knew. These men that
belyue alteracion of bread be not so far of the altar but they may judge what
it is and how bygg it is, the may tak the bread in there hand and wey it if the
list take and prove all experience and warrant booth reason and sensesthat it
is alitle peace of bread and noman. Had the Epicures been as Nere the son as
the Aposteles were unto the hody of Christ at his departure out of this worold
they would have iudgid of the son other wyce, but for asmouche as they iudgyd
affter there senses they be more to be commendyd then those men, that nether
belyuythe the word of god, nether reason nor there senses but plainly deny the
thing theysee, and say a peace of bread is god and man, where as is not at all
one ynche of a man, nor of mannys proporcion. These men ar worthy to be
persuadyd, as he that seyth the snow whyt and yet will not belyue it, uerberibus
as the scoles theachithe and non ratione. then has my lord an other
mocpareson, and would make godd the thing that he purposith. And says why be
men more offendyd to belyue the body of Christ to be in the sacrament, more
then when that god being immensus could be holy includyd in the uirginnesbely,
the wherefore is that the scripture co^maundi^^ us to belyue the on and not the
other, Conceptus est de spiritu sancto, natus ex Maria uirgine, Matt. 12. Luc.
12. Men saw him in the worold and when he departid out of the worold. Now my
lord knowith right well that in Christ be too natures one divine, and the other
humane. And each of them has his proper qualites. God was holy in the belly
and holy out of the belly, man was holy in the belly and not out of the belly
till the time of his birth, then holy out of the belly and not within the belly.
So says Augustine fuit totus in uentre, totus in cruce, totus in inferno and
totus in sepulchro. But this is the property of his godhed and not of his
manhed, that is in one place and never with out place, the other in all places,
andyet in no place. D^us est totus in toto and totus in qnalibet eius part, as
the soul of man is. And asfor the auctorite of loan. Chrysostom he prouith not
my lords purpose but disprouith for he says oculis intellectus perspiciamus,
there is noman but says the body of Christ is present to the faith of man,
how be it not carnally nather bodily receauid of him that receauithe the
sacrament. De modo presentiae est totum dissidium Chrysostom declarith how he is
present in sprit unto faith and not in the body unto the Mouth. And godly
spoken of this doctor, so said Ireneus before him, that there is too thin ges
in the sacrament one to the senses and the other to the sprit, for if there
were nothing representid unto the faith by the sacraments, then were they no
sacraments but bare signs which noman says then accusi the my lord those
that say it is the btead that muldy the, and says the devil has tawght men
to say somewhat, if it be not bread, let some man tell us what it is that
muldith, it cannot be nothing he would make men helyue, that nothing
corruptithe by miracle, this is a wounderfull miracle that is wrowght in
nothing. Here is three things putrefactio^, nothing, And a miracle by the pour
of god and yet all three nothing after my lords mind. I deny any miracle at all
to be in the sacrament. But every thing wrowghthe by god accustomydly, by ^ayth
remission of sin and augme^tacion of gods yefftes, and the signs to remain
in there propere nature so does Augnstine deny any miracle to be in the
sacrament lib. de Trinit. 3. cap. 10. It is innocentius 3. that would prove
this wrong opinion of transubstanciacion by miracle in his book de officio
missae, Then doothe my lord name 1500. Yers that the church has belyuid it.
If it be true why does not he name thauctors that makyth godd his sayng: all
the scripture, and old doctors be against him, The breaking of the bread has
been usid in the church this 1500. years and od, but not in a private mass as
it is at this day but unto all the church. Gregory's time was over chargid
with supersticion, yet was the communion of booth kinds usid then among the
people. And this manne died not for 1500. hundrithe yers sith. He was created
byshope of Rome 157. yers aster the death of August. And died Anno 604. in the
reign of phocas the emperor. That first de^rede te church of Rome to be the head
of Grekys and Latinnes thowghe the church of Constantinople never consentid
there unto. The name of the mass began then ffyrst tobe known among the
people how be it^ it was a communion and no private mass. Souch as make James
the Apo^^el^ and Basilius thauctors of this wyckid and deuillyshe private Mass.
Most prove that they say by good auctorite. Except the mean by the name of
the mass the communion of the lords supper. It should seem by the canon of the
mass. That is at this day redyn which was wroten i^ Gregory's time, that the
mass was a communion for the pryst offryd the ye^^tes of the people the bread
ad w^nne unto god with thanks by these words. Per Christum dominum nostrum,
per quem haec omnia domine semper bona creas^ sanctificas, uiuificas, benedicis
etc. so callith Ireneus and Tertullian the bread of thanks yeuing the creature
of god where by is notyd the difference betwyne commune bread and the bread
dedycadyd unto an holy use and memo^y of Christ's deathe^ yet not with stonding
they call the bread and the win creatures and not the accidence of creatures
as our men of late days doothe. Were there no more books but the Mass book
wherein is conteynyd all ^his prophanacion and abuses of Christ's supper, it is
easy to be prouyd by the prayers therein conteynyd and u^yd, in Gregoryes time
that the Mass was a communion thus the pryst and the people prayed. Corporis
^acri and preciosi sanguinis repleti libaminae, que^umus domine Deus noster
etc. Again. Saciasti domine ^amiliam tua^mun^ribus sacris. Beda that was 90.
yers after the death of Gregory in the time of Sergius primus knew not of
transubstantiacion nor of pryuat Masses. No in the ^yme of Carolus the great
200. yers after death of Gregory there was no souche Massyng as my lord
speakythe of. But Masses then began to (...) into estimacion when the order
of Benedict inlargyd there Closters in f^roaunce (other orders were not then
begoten) These Monks said pryuate Masses and applyd the Merits thereof for
the sins of other. After the death of Carolus Raygnyd his son Hludouicus
Anno 815. in whois days private Masses came into souche estimacion that people
neglectyd the communion, and thowght it sufficient if the pryst said Mass and
receauid the bre^ for them where upon the prince made al aw that the people
should co^municat with the church three times in the year. As Ausegisus whrytyth
canone, 38lib. 2. yet people estimed the Mass more holy and better the^ the
institution of Christ and passyd nether of god, nether of the law of the
prince. Then was there an other law made that all men should ons in the year
communicate and use the lords supper as the Canon: Omnis utriusque sexus
testyfieth. This private breaking of bread is not of souche antiquite as my
lord speakythe of. as we may se by the decrees of Clement the third de peniten^
and Rem^ss. Who lyuid in Anno 1200 Lombartus does a lege in the sentence no
elder auctor then Sergium 2. Os porci cognominatum who reynid Anno 842. 30.

He that lystith to read more of this isle let him read the 4. book of Lombert.
There keeping of it in the box, and kneling down at the time of sacring is but
the commandment of Honorius 3. bishope of Rome as it apperith by his words
lib. 3. decretalium Titulo de celebracione Missaru^. And this Honorius died
Anno 1226, As conserning the boothe kinds of the sacraments it was not for
byddyn in the time of the master of the ^^ntence who lyuid Anno 11^2.
Friderycho Sueuo Imperatore Augusto. Nor in the time of Tomas Aquinas for in a
certain Hymn he speakythe thus of the distrybution of the sacrament unto the
hole church.

Sic sacrificium istud instituit
Cuius officium committi uoluit
Solis presbyteris quibus sic congruit
Vt sumant and dent caet^ris
If the prist gave unto the people that he receauid himself there was no part
of the sacrament taken ffrom them as it is at this day. Yet Shame they not isle
men to say there mass is 1500. years old. No no this isle came into the church
after the condemnacion of the great clark Ber^ngarius as is said before. When
my lord would stablyshe his doctrine by the auctorite of the doctors be cause
they say the win and the bread is changid. They make not for my lords
purpose for they speak of one alteracion, and my lord speakith of an other^
They say not that the substance and matter of the bread and win is changid.
But that the use of it is changid, for where before it was commune bread and
commune win, now it is with great religion takyn for the presentacion and
confirmacion of all gods promyses unto his church for the death of his
son. The doctors doothe w^^ to call the bread the body and the win the
bludd. For Christ so callid it. As it has been usid ffrom the beginning of the
church until this day to call a sacrament by the name of the thing ^ignified
by the sacrament. V^e thy self unto the scripture Christian Reder and then
thou shall perceive all the doctors for the space of 900. yers to stand of thy
part and never mindid this transubstancion of the bread and win. Red
Augustine de sermonibus fidelium, quia Christus inquit, Passus ^st pro nobis,
commendauit nobis in isto sacramento, corpus et sanguinem suum, quem etiam
^ecit and nos ipsos. Nam et nos ipsius corpus ^acti sumus, per misericordiam
ipsius, quod accipimus and nos sumus and in the same sermon he says in nomine
Christi tanquam ad calicem uenistis ibi uos estis in mensa, and ibi uos estis
in calice. As our bodies naturally are not the body of Christ nor corporally
our bodis be not in the chalice but by ^ayth we are h is members and
spiritually coniugnid with him in the chalice, so spiritually he yeuithe us his
bodye^ if Christ corporally be yeuine unto us in the sacrament, then
corporally ar those that receive the sacrament in the chalice which were an
absurdite to grant. So likewice he interpretatith this spiritual rec^auing of
Christ's body in sermon ad infantes Expounding these words of Paul, Vnus
panis and unu^ corpus multl sumus. Tertul. lib. 4. contra Marcionem does
expound these words, Ho^ est corpus m^um. And prouithe there by, that the
bread is not the body naturally of Christ. But prouithe by these words that
Christ had a treue body and was uery man, sayng phantasma non capit figuram sed
ueritas, aliud enim a pane corpus Jesus habet nec pro nobis panis traditus, sed
ipsum Christi uerum corpus traditum in cr^cem, quod panis figura in coena
exhibitum est. He callithe this sacrament the sign of his body, and yet never
condemnid for an hery tike. And this should the berter content the mind of man
that where as August. in lib. de heresibus doothe note certain erroures of
Tertullian: yet conserning this matter of the sacrament he speaky the not one
word against him. ffor Augustine himself beliuithe as Tertullian did. As he
testifiethe contra Adamantum. Non dubitauit dominus dicere, Hoc est corpus
meum, cum signum daret corporis sui. Why is not Augustine condemnyd for an
heretic and his books burnid berause he says that the lord douttid not to
say this is my body. When he grave the sign of his body. Tertullian denith
plainly the bread to be his body li. 4. contra Marc, speaking of the bread,
Acceptum inquit, and distributu^ discipulis corpus ^uum illum fecit etc. quo
modo corpus suum fecit, si panis non est corpus, sed fig^ra corporis eius:
panem fecit corpus, id est sui corporis representationem consecrauit. So doothe
Cypriane Epistola ad Cecilium say of the chalice. Non potest uideri sanguis
eius quo redempti and uiuificat sumus, esse in calice quando uinu^ desit
calici, quo Christi sanguis ostenditur the wine is put into the chalice to
represent the blud of Christ. So in his sermon de oratione dominica say the
that this supper is a mystical and sacramental e^ting and drinking of
Christrs body, by faith and not carnally as this opinion of transubsta^ciation
would have it. Mentis non dentis sacramenta sunt pabula in quit August. Saynct^
Hiero in Epist. ad Rusticum. Nihil diciu^ Exuperio Tolose episcopo ait, ut qui
uasis ecclesi^e praeciosis in pauperu^ alimoniam distractis, corpus Christi in
canistro uimineo, and sanguinem portare in uitro. Also li. 2. contra
^ouinianum, and quaestione secunda ad Hedibiam. He doothe as Christ did, as the
Aposteles did, as the scripture doothe. call the sacrament of Christ's body the
body it self. And so we read in saint Am brose id quod panis erat ante
co^secrationem, corpus esse Christi post consecrationem the bread was called
the thing that the bread representid. Because men should with the more reverence
and owsten use this holy sacrament. But what his censure and judgment was of
the sign it may he knowyn in his commentaries upon the ffyrst Epistole to the
Cor. capite. 11. where he say the that the supper is the sign of the thing and
not the thing it self. he cally the the cup the figure of the blud and not
the blud it self. the books de sacramentis that be named to be his be not
his`as those too reasones may well persuade. the doctrine of them agreythe not
with the doctrine of his other works nether with the wrytynges of his scoler
and disciple saynct Augustine. Read his 10. book de humanitate Christi assumpta
in Luca^. Ergo non supra terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem, te querere
debemus, si uolumus inuenire, nunc enim secu^dum carnem non nouimus Christum.
Denique Stephanus non supra terram quesiuit qui stantem ad dextram Dei uidit.
Maria autem quae querebat in terra, tangere non potuit. Stephanus tetigit, quia
quesiuit in coelo this doothe Hilarious godly declare in the 137. Psalm, where
so ever this later age could take occacyon of any holy Doctors writing by the
lest word of the worold, they wrestyd the word ffrom the Doctors meaning to
stablyshe there opinion of tra^substancion of bread every doctor of antiquite
makythe against it, and yet the will not leaw there miserable blyndnis. I would
repet more places of the doctors. But it nedithe not those that has wroten
against this falsched before me in Latin and in English better lernyd then I
has gathered so many places to gather that it suffycythe every heart that is
not weddyd unto his opinyon. Red saynct August. in 6. capiter of Joan. and in
the 98. Psalms, Expondyng these words (nisi manducaueritis carnem filij
hominis) in the person of Christ says this, Spiritualiter inquit intelligite
quae loquutus sum. Non hoc corpus estis manducaturi quod uidetis, and bibituri
illum sanguinem, que^ fusuri sunt qui me crucifigent* Sacramentum aliquod uobis
commendaui, spiritualiter intellectum uiuificat caro non prodest quicquam etc.
Would to god the worold could understond this kind of eating. Souche as would
prove Christ's body to be here upon therthe ha the nothing but words of there
own inuencion with out the scripture where with the deceive the unlernid it
is sone do^ne to make godd athing impossibleby words and a sweet oracion to
souche as be ignorant of the matter that is spoken of as Cicero. Nihil tam
incredibile, quod non dicendo fiat probabile, nihil tam horridum quod non
splendescat oratione, and tanquam excolatur as it may well be seen in this
matter of the sacrament where as people by words ar constraynid to honor apeace
of bred for god. Then my lord would make godd the wicked mass by diuersice of
terms instirucion and tradicion. And says that Paul delivered unto the
Corinth by tradlcion the use of the lords supper. And wou^d make the
deuillyshe mass to be the tradicio^ of the Apo steles because Paul says,
Caetera cum uenero disponam. And of these words my lord would infer that all
this Romish rites and usayges of massing, were the tradicio^ of the Aposteles
but the place seruith nothing to pue my lordespurpose. It is no need to go by
conjectures asmy lord doothe to interpretat Paul's words, the mean nothing of
the supper. ffor Paul says con^erning the use thereof he deliuerid unto them,
the thing he receauid of the lord. In the which words ar too things to
benotid ffyrst as concerning the use of sacraments in the church it should be
none other wice tawght nor ministrid unto the people than god commaundithe. And
that only god is thauctor of every sacrament and has prescribid how they
should be usid. The second is that the Corinth. were before in all things
aright instruc^d according unto the institucion of Christ in the use of the
^acrame^t. But in other things Paul desirid the church of Corinth to be
reformid therefore he said. Caetera cum uenero disponam theophilact is of my
part. But the use of the sacrament was plainly. Absolutely, and most holyly
tawght and usid before in there church. As these words ffull of emphasis and
uertew declarithe, Ego accepi a domino quod tradidi uobis. I wounder what
mouithe my lord to say Paulement these words of the supper and would make
Paul and the scripture auctor of souche abhominacion as the mass is that now
is usid Those that redithe the histories and wrytinges of our elders, knowith
what byshopes of late days made this mass. The Apostoles and primative
church did celebrad the lords most holy supper, without pomp, and all this
rabble of stinking ceremonys most simplely. My lord should not be offendid with
those that would the supper to be usid simplely. He should remember that the
lord himself and his Aposteles usid it so, with the prayer of Christ Pater
noster. As Hieron^ and Gregory testifithe the one li. 3. contra pelagianos.
The Other li. Epistolarum 8. Epist. 7. The historys be plain what the byshopes
of Rome has done in this matter. How and by whom these ceremonys has been
augmentid. The uer be prolambano that paul usithe signifies as budeus says
in commentarijs linguae Graecae per manus traditum acc^pio, ut successor facit
qui prouinciam accipit. Significat and a maioribus accipio, and quasi per manus
traditu^ accipio. Et a maioribus audiendo accipere Paul could not have
deliueryd this supper of Christ unto the church except he had ffyrst receauid
it. Nor Moses the law unto the Israelites. Is this a godli manner of speaking to
say Moses gave the law unto the ^ewes. The Apostoles prechid the gospel unto
the Jews and gentilles. Paul preactid and institutid the sacraments
commanudeid by god. Therefore the law of god, the gospel of Christ and his
sacraments be the tradicions of Moses and the Aposteles. They speak never of
them selfs, and gave nothing of there own brains unto the churches. But
Moses and the prophets said this all way: sic dicit dominus. So says Paul,
Ego accepi a domino quod tradidi uobis. And god took ffrom the prophets and
the Aposteles all auctorite clean that they should speak nothing in te church
but as they were tawght. Sic dices filijs Israel: Praedicate ea quae ego dixi
uobis Matt. 28. I will council the Chrissiane reader to leave the books of
men and lern the scripture who only teachithe all trewthe and right use of the
sacraments. And to follow the council of Cypriane^ Si ad diuinae traditionis
caput and originem reuertamur, Cessat error homanus: and sacramentoru^
celestium ratione^ perspecta, quicquid sub caligin ac nube tenebraru^ obscurum
latebat. luce ueritatis operitur. Hoc ergo oportet facere dei sacerdotes,
p^cepta diuina servants, ut in aliqo si nutauerit, and uacillauerit ueritas ad
origine^ dominica^, and Euangelica^, Apostolicamque traditionem reuertamur, et
inde surgat actus nostri ratio unde and ordo and origo surrexit. The scripture
and tradicion of the Aposteles we must ffolow. The Mass has nether god ner
the scripture, nor honesty that defendythe it. for lak of auctoryte they gangle
an old wiefes tale, that gracianus theachythe. Read of the foundation and
founders of the Mass more apud Polydorum urbinam de rerum inuentoribus, lib.
5. cap. 9. and 10. This is a-wofull doctrine to preach unto the people that
lackyth a father. My lord tellythe atalle of Ananias that was sent to Pa^ule
Acto. 9. and of Moses that lead the Chyldron of Israel in the desert yet were
they belyuyd of the people. But why? Ananias said: Saul frater, dominus misit
me ad te. so said Moses, so said the Prophets when so ever the preached or
tawght any thing. We can prove by the scripture that they were sent from god.
Now these men that cum to the people with transubsta^cion we know by the
scripture they are against god and his trewthe, therefore people must ffolow this
commandment of Paul: Omnia probate, quod bonum est tenete. For the scripture
co^demnythe those that preachith there awgne imagynatio^s and dishonorithe the
truithe. God for bid that oni should condemn Moses or the Prophets or now him
that prechythe the word of the living god he commendyd Moses and other that
preachyd trewly and condemnythe souche as preachythe falsely. And where my lord
says that in the 24. of luce and the second of the acts, that the supper of
the lord was usid under one kyne of bread that is not so. Thowghe only bread
be namid yet was there wine ministrid likwyce for Christ is lik unto himself
all ways, and would not be a breaker of his own institucion under boothe
kinds. Thowghe there be but one made mencio^ of in this place. My lord is not
ignorant that bread is taken in the scripture for the hole ffest and ba^ket as
we see Genesis 18. in the pater noster we say pane^ nostru^ quotidianum da nobis
hodie. And by the bread undrestond all things necessari for the body. Victum
pacem, defensionem, bonam uoletudinem etc. This manner of speech was also usid
among the gentiles. As Erasmus wrytithe in symbola Pythagorae, Panem inquit ne
frangito. The gentiles at the making of peace and lowdes eat togather in one
ffest which was as a confirmacion of the peace. So doothe Christian men when
they be at peace with god throwghe Christ. And as the Ethnikes were admonishid
to keep the peace reconsilid by there sacraments so be the Christianes also.
Why does not my lord Mark these words Act. 2. Era^t perseuera^tes in doctrina
Apostoloru^ and co^municatione and fractione panis and precatio nibus. Why
doothe they not study to restore the doctrine of the Apostoles into the church
again and let this adulterous tradicions of men pass. That church was
assurid of Christ by his word. And this church that men defend has cast out
gods word and the Aposteles also. Then my lord says by thauctorite of
Gregory Nazianzene that it is not necessary to observe all things in the
fupper as Christ did. I grant the same or else we should have our fet wayshid
as the Aposteles had. But let mi lord prove that we should not use the supper as
a communion distributid unto thole church under both kinds. And the^ has my
lord done somewhat Then by the auctory of the prophet Malachie ca. 1. my lord
would stablyshe the Mass and prove it to be a sacrifice. Ab ortu solis usque
ad occasum magnum est, Nomen meum in gentibus, and in omni loco incensum
offertur nomini meo atque oblatio munda. The prophets mind was that all the
ceremonies of the law should have an end when Messiah came, and that all the
Christianes should offer Mucktar unto god, thymiama uel incensum. Now this word
mucktar signifies also prayer Psalm. 141. adapteiur oration me uelut incensum
ante conspectum tuum. And the prayer of the Christianes is this oblacion spoken
of by the prophet. And not the mass. Nor the word that ffolowithe Minhah
helpith the mass nothing at all. Which signifiet farinacea^ oblationem sieve
molam. And his taken Psalm. 141. for the evening prayer. By this word Minhah
the prophet under stood the uocacion of the gentiles unto the ffaythe of
Christ. Non est mihi in uobis beneplacitum dicit dominus, neque acceptum habeo
munus ciboru^, id est, oblationem de manu uestra, id est, a uobis oblatam.
Etenim ab ortu solis ad occasum eius usque id est, erit tempus gratiae quo
acceptabo munus gentium, quod offerent mihi in omni loco nomini meo ince^sum
atque mola pura offertur (erit) oblatum munus mundum per cultum ueteris legis,
intelligit cultu^ nouae, id est, optime preces and anime fidelium thus does
the great clerk uatablus writ in his annotacions. Diuus Theodoretus Episcopus
Cyrensis writythe in this manner. Non est mihi uoluntas in uobis, dicit dominus
omnipotens etc. funditus uos reijciam, nam permultum detestor uestra facta and
uictimas, quas offertis execror quarum loco uniuersum orbem terrarum, me summa
religione colentem habeo. Nam omniu^ habitatores terrarum, quas sol ex oriens
and occidens, suis radijs illustrat, cum ubique incensum offerrent, tum etiam
sa crum, purumque mihi gratu^ conficient, cognoscent enim nomen meum, and
uoluntatem, and debitum honorem pre stabunt, and accommodatu^ cultum
adhibebunt. Sic enim dominus ad Samaritanam. Mulier creed mihi, quia uenit hora
quando nec in monte hoc, neque Hierosolymis adorabitis patrem. Vos adoratis
quod nescitis, nos adoramus quod scimus, quia salus ex Iudaeis est. Sed uenit
hora, and nunc est, quando ueri adoratores adorabunt patrem in spiritu and
ueritate. Paulus his edoctus, in omni loco iubet orare, leuantes puras manus
sine ira and disceptatione. Et diuinus Malachias plane nos ex his docet eam
pictatem quam nunc profitemur, in omni loco obitum iri. Nam circumscriptio loci

tanquam signum uirtutis odoratum incensum existit. Iudaei autem iuxta Malachiae
praedictionem, reiecti sunt. Ideo nomen meu^, inquit, magnum inter gentes. The
prophet never meant nor none other lernid man that knowith the tongues, to bring
a Iewishe ceremony into the church of the gentiles. And to enclose Christ in
this Mealy sacrifice of the altar. Read the 12. chapter of Paul to the To.
and se what sacrifice is requirid of the Christian. My lord has the sound of
one word more of the Ebrew Missah. And would that the sacrifice in the law
callid Missah, should be a figure and type of this popish mass facies
solemnitate^ ebdomadarum domino deo tuo, cum leuacione uoluntaria manus tuae,
quam dabis, secundum quod benedixerit te dominus deus tuus. Deuteronomy. 16. god
commaundid in the end of haruist to celebrat this solenne ffest and to offer
unto the lord part of every grain that came of the earth not only because they
should give him thanks ffor the preseruacion of the people ffrom hungre and
faymi ne but also to acknolege him to give all things only and not to attribut
the plentiouse and abundant harvest unto ffortune as the Epicures doothe. And
likewyce to confess that his grace and ffauor makithe rich, and his
displeasure pour and not to attribut the gifftes they receauid unto the second
causes as the Stoykes doothe that say god is bound to do as the second cause is
disposid, it is not so for he can make skarsite and need of corn where as is
good fertile ground, and abundance, in the baryn feles, and Now if, an oten or
barley shefe that was offrid for the purpose that I have shewid figurid the
mass let the Christian reader judge, I meruell my lord is so ffull of
Alligories and speakythe nothing of the text when an allegory prouithe
nothing. But is usid to declare the thing that we would prove. Let him ffirst
prove his proposicion by, the scripture. And then I will admit the figurative
loquucion as truithe shall forse me my lord in the end of his book speakyth of
them that study to impung this stablyshyd uerety as he callyth it of the
church the ministracion of the sacrament under one kind and then says they are not only in that high matter of the sacrament. But also in ceremonys and
namely souche as garnyshe Christ's religion wherein he says the devil usythe
A meruelouse point of Sophistrye by division, and examyning parts alone which
parts so consyderyd sever allye be nothing, and yet ioynyd to gather be some
what etc. My lord will open this point of Sophistrye he says, which
consystethe in division between the hole and the part. And puttithe this
example if one were asked whether a farthyng would make a ryshe man? A simple
man would say: nay etc. Then makythe he his simile: like wysse in the
discussion of ceremonies, semelynys, and oders, the devil fframythe his
quaestions by deuysyon and askythe of each thing alone. as for example whether
a shaven crown makythe a pryst: then answer is made nay. doothe a long gown
make a prystnay and so fforthe as my lord tellythe his tale. My lord has well
opened a point of Sophistrye doutles as he that meant nothing else but to set a
whicche candell before the Iyes of the simple that they should not see the
truithe. And would carry them by sophistrye whether he lystythe. He that will
argue of a similitude must put all ways too things alyk that the one may open
the other. Now my lord makith a co^paricion of too things unlike as the
qualites of gall should, in swetnis be comparid unto the qualites of honey. Every
man knowithe that this is true in tweny pound necessaryly to be conteynid
twenty nobles. Twenty grotes, twenty pence, twenty halfpence, and twenty
farthinges, and not possible to have the greater sum without the less. Is
the like in the dignite of a byshope or prist suppose ye, that who so ever was
or is a godd pryst must have necessayly that shaven crown, and long gown. I
report me to the scripture they benethere necessary nor co^me^dable signs to
know a prist by. As thou hnowist the lest nombre to be co^prehe^dyd in the
more. So be these uertewes comprehendid in a true byshope and not a crown.

of Joan ffrith and others: and says they made the sacraments acts
indifferent to be usid and not to be usid, as it pleasith man. Iwould to our

isle opinion but not Tyndall, ffryth. nor none other that wrytithe or has
wroten in our days. Except the ungodly Anabaptists. And asfor that my lord
says Bucer, Luther, and mani other with the hole church of truithe, Be
against souche as would have no corporal presense of Christ's body in the
sacrament. The church of truth is with them and the word of god as every man
may se and read in there works. And that those great lernid men be against
them and the truth, in this matter it is an Argument that faith is the sole
yefft of god and commithe not into the solle of man because he is lernid. But
