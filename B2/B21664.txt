TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES II: KING OF GREAT BRITAIN,
FRANCE, and IRELAND: The Author, His Majesty's most Loyal Subject, Humbly
Dedicates this following POEM.

ANGLIA REDIVIVA.
NO Voice, more soft then Thunder, can express
Our present Joy, or our past Heaviness:
None can the Largeness of This Joy set out,
Unless at once He make THREE KINGDOMS Shout:
Which is the Greater, since through Grief it Came:
As Water Vanquished still Augments the Flame.
In Mirth, and Laughter now, and Pleasant Tones,
We Spend that Breath, which we Fetched up for Groans.
Oh, how we Droopt, and Hung our Heads to see
Rebellion Prosper? How we grieved to be
Iudgd for the Wicked by Perfidious Knaves;
By No Man Ruled, but Kept in Awe by Slaves.
Oh, how we greiv'd to see that Vip'rous Brood,
By whose Black, Hellish Sire, the Royal Blood
Of Blessed CHARLES was shed, to bear the sway?
And (which was worse) to see that none but They
Or Their small Myrmidons should be the Men
Esteemed for Godly? 'as if the DEVIL, again
Had on those Clothes, which once in HEAVEN he Wore.
He learns to Bleat, who still was wont to Roar.
But now those Varlets are, as they should be,
Sunck in the Depth of Scorn and Infamy;
Thrown down even by Those Hands, which did them Raise:
Reviled by Those, who gave them greatest Praise.
See, Rebels, See the HAND OF GOD. Where now
Are all those Laurels, which once Crowned the Brow
Of that Victorious-CROMWEL? They were all
Turned into Ashes at his Funeral,
And Covered in His Urne. But first, those Bays
GOD Used for Rods to Whip His Sons: His Praise
Survive'd Him but for This: That His Great Name
Might Raise Them up, that They might Fall with Shame.
And those Wild Wretches, who Drew down These Elves,
Pulled Them on their own Heads, and Fell Themselves;
Still Tumbling on the other: 'till their Fall
Had made some way for that Brave GENERAL,
The Clorious MONCK, to Step up to that Height,
Where being Fixed, He had no need to Fight:
He Conquered by His Words: Three Nations came
Straight to do Homage to His Mighty NAME.
Thus having All in's Hands: He gave the Power
To Him whose Right it was: made Himself Lower.
He might be, which he would of these Two Things,
The Best of Subjects, or The Worst of Kings:
By Less'nings Power thus He Gained more Renown,
'Twas HEAVEN Gave CHARLES, but MONCK Put on His CROWN.
Now that our KING's PROCLAIMED, what shall we say?
Sure this Blessed Month will make our Years all MAY. The KING was Proclaimed in
May -- 60.

What Pleasant Days shall we have now, when He
Who has not only Strength, but MAJESTY,
And Lawful Power shall only bear the sway,
And with his Looks Fright SAINT- like Fiends away?
This was in the number of our late Complaints,
That the worst Villains were esteemd Best SAINTS.
But now our SUN is up, and all is Clear,
And Knaves, and Rebels, as they Are, Appear.
Now we may Teach each poor Deluded Thing,
That it is not Treason to be for the KING.
Where are those Mock-SAINTS now? Thus (as they say)
The DEVIL Walks not, when he sees it is Day.
O, that They, who did Boast their Cause to be
Most Just, because 'twas Prosperous, would See
What GOD has Wrought for Him, whom They Would Withstand.
What Wonders GOD has Shown to bring this Land
Into Subjection to their Lawful KING,
(The Theme's too High for Me) let ANGELS Sing.
Yea sure the Heavenly Host do all Proclaim
The Praise of This Great Act, Due to the Name
Of Him, by whom KINGS Reign. And O that I
Could make my Soul, winged with Devotion Fly
To GOD! And Think (what Words cannot reach) His Praise!
Who without Blood has Crowned our KING with Baies,
Brought from Three Conquered Nations: Which now He
Holds in Subjestion, but to keep them Free:
Even from that Yoke of Bondage, which of late
So Galled our Necks; whilst That, they called a State,
Was naught but Madmen sitting at the Helm:
'Twas a Great Bedlam, which is now a Realm.
Worse then Egyptian Bondage This, to be
The Subjects of the Popularity:
And those so Giddy-headed too, that none
Knew what to Do, or what to leave Undone.
Each little Writer every week brings in
His Form of Government: as if 't had bin
Not harder to new Mould a Kingdom, then
To get a Standish, and to make a Pen.
Nay HEVVSON, and the like Mechanics Prate
Like the Supporters of a Ruinous State,
As if they thought it were no more to do
To Frame a State, then it is to make a Shoe.
But those Mad Times are past, and now we are
Even Rescued from the SWORD without a WAR.
Without a WAR Great CHARLES His Kingdoms VVon:
Thus straight, when GOD will Have't, the Thing is Done.
And now, Blessed Prince, since by Your Sufferings You
Have made the World to know what You can Do
In Better Times; who Did so well in Ill:
Still Conquering all those Passions, which do Still
Invade the Oppressed: No Fear, or Anger could
Cast your Brave Soul in an Unchristian Mould,
In all Your Wrongs, and Dangers; still your Mind
Was to Religion, lustice, GOD, Inclined.
Nay when some Griefs, and Troubles needs must come
To get, Great SIR, in Your large Breast some room,
Your Mind stands Firm, and all rough thoughts Outbraves;
Like Rocks Unmoved with the most Boisterous Waves.
Since You by Suffering Thus, have made us know
The True Height of Your Soul O, may we Bow,
In a deep Sense of our Felicity,
To Heaven first, next to Your self, our Knee.
Oh, may we Thankful be, and sing His Praise,
Who for our Cypress now has given us Baies:
May we give GOD and CAESAR All their Due,
And Him Obey still, in Obeying You.
With Tears of Joy that You are now Come in,
And Sorrow that your MAJESTY has bin
So long Time Absent, we would make a Flood
To Wash this LAND, Staind with Your FATHERS Blood.
Who, both in Life and Death so Conquering Fate,
Was never Unhappy, though Unfortunate:
What Glory gained He by His Sufferings?
He Lived, and Died, even like the KING OF KINGS.
O may You Guide us, as He would have done,
Had we not Run into Rebellion.
May You Live Those Great Things, He VVrote; and Be
Your Self A New EIKON ASILIK.
To His Great Praise may You still Add Your Own,
'Till You Change This for an Eternal CROWN.
FINIS.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD GENERAL MONCK.
April 18. 1660.
GO on, Wise SIR, and make Your Self The GREAT,
By Conquering Those, whom You Disdain to Beat,
What Wonder will Your Bloodlesse Triumphs gain!
THREE KINGDOMS Conquered, and not One Man Slain!
Your Valor thus, with Matchless Prudence, can
Distroy the FOE, and yet not Hurt the Man:
We Long to see the Time, when You Will Appear
To Be, what Good Men Hope, what Others Fear
That This Dark CHAOS of Affairs may be
But a Resemblance of the Infancy
Of the CREATION: which began in Night:
Confusion Brought forth Order, Darkness Light.
Trust not in Your own Strength: be sure to Do
What Honor, Law and Conscience Binds You to:
So You may Justly Hope, that HE, whose Hand
Has Set You Up; will give You Power to Stand.
Stand, NOBLE SIR, that Our Bowed Necks may be
Raised by Your Hand to our Old -- Nunquam Libertas gratior extat Quam sub Rege
Pio -- Claud.
Liberty
Then, ENGLAND'S Mourning turned to Joy, We'll Sing:
CROMWELL Killed CHARLES! But MONCK Revived the KING.
FINIS
