To them who are called the Common-Wealths-men, both in the Army and Parliament
to read.
FRIENDS.
IN several of you I know there has stirred, and does often stir a pure, true
living principle of God, which has begot, (and does beget) true, honest and
upright desires, and breathings in you after righteousness, true liberty and
freedom, (and loathings of oppression and Tyranny) and it has been in the
hearts of some of you, and much upon you to break down oppression and tyranny,
and to remove oppressors, and to make void all such laws as makes provision for
tyranny and oppression, whereby the oppressors has long been strengthened in
their oppressing the people of this Nation; and some of you have felt the
weight and burden of oppression and tyranny, (under which the innocent
suffers) and it has been much in your hearts to set up righteous laws,
whereby all people might have equity and justice done to them, and for them, by
such as you have had thoughts to put in authority, which would do just and
equal things between man and man, without respect to persons.

These things the Lords witness (in you) has showed unto you, that they ought
to be done by you, and some of you have breathed and desired much to do these
things, when ye have owned the pure movings and stirrings of the measure of the
life and power of God (in you) which has stired and moved in you) toward
righteousness, equity, mercy, and justice; But hitherto ye have been much
hindered in this work.

And truly Friends, there are many things yet remaining in and among you, (Mark
that) which hinders and stops you in this work of true reformation, and they
will stop you therein (Mark that) so long as they bear rule in and among you,
and are consented to (and regarded) by you, many of those things are as
follows.

First, There are many that pretends that they are of you, (Mark that) which
has joined unto you in some outward appearance; but it is more for fear of
losing their places, and the riches and honor of this World, then for love to
the cause of equity, Justice and true liberty; And these are in the Priests
nature, who for covetousness, and self ends, can change with the times, and
governments, and pretend they are for them (so long a they will hold them up)
and such are neither true to God, nor their Country; for they can lay down
their Religion, which they have pretended to stand for, and deny the Cause of
their Country, if it will make most for their own gain, and then say, It was
the Lords doing, and they are satisfied in it, though it be quite contrary to
that which they have formerly contended for; and of this sort there are many
among you which stops the work you ought to do.

And several of you also, in whom the Truth of God have stirred against
oppression and tyranny, verily your minds are yet so much in your Commissions
and places, and in the love, and honor, and wisdom of this World, that this
stops you in the work ye ought to do. And some of you have so many Relations,
mark that, that have such a great gain, in those very things which greatly
oppresses the people of this Nation; and also some of your selves are
concerned in these things, that so ye cannot tell how to take away oppression
wholly, without taking away their and your own gain; and these things being
looked at by you, they exceedingly stops you in the work you ought to do;
because herein private self ends, and respect to persons, by you is preferred
before the general good of all.

Now Friends, whilst your minds, and thoughts and hearts runs into, or after
any of these things, They (with the enemy of your souls) will not suffer you to
do that which is equal, no further (to be sure) then will stand safe for the
upholding and prefering of your Relations, and your own private, particular
self ends.

Therefore all wait in that which is pure and living of God, in you, which will
show you all deceit, if ye keep to it, that so by it your minds may be
redeemed out of all self, and respect to persons, that so all particular
private self ends, and respect to persons, may be denied, and utterly trampled
upon by you, and that the general good and freedom of all, without respect of
persons, may be minded and acted for, by you, that so ye may serve the Lord
God, and your generation in singleness and uprightness of heart, and then the
Lord will honor you, and he will be your sufficient reward.

Verily it is a mighty thing, and it is highly to be prized by you, especially
ye of the Army, that ever the Lord God should make use of you again, and again
put an oppertunity into your hands, to do that which you formerly promised and
vowed unto the Lord [and your Nation] to do, seeing ye so slighted (Mark that)
the former opertunities which the Lord God gave you, and acted so treacherously
and deceitfully as ye did in your backslidings; and if ye should slight this
opertunity also, do not expect another, (be not deceived, God will not be
mocked) Therefore, consider these things, and mind to answer the Lords love yet
continued unto you.

But if ye look out at, or suffer your minds to run into, (Mark) the greatness
of your places, or after your gain, or the honor of the World; or if ye look
out at love or hatred of your pretended Friends or known enemies, or at any
particular self-end whatsoever; These things will strangle the principle of God
in you, which moves to do that which is equal and just unto all, and then the
tender seed in you which feels the weight and burden of oppression that will
be murdered; and then deadness and hardness of heart will come upon you more
and more, and ye will settle deeper and deeper in the death; and verily, if ye
should do thus, ye would become even as Sodom and Gomorah unto the Lord, and he
would overturn you with a great and mighty destruction (as he did them)
Therefore remember you have been warned.

So look at none of these things, but look ye to the Lord God, and mind the
movings of his life [in you] and be obedient thereto, and as oppression, and
tyranny and in justice is made manifest unto you [by the light of the Lord in
you] in the power of the Lord committed unto you, break it down and overturn
it, and set up and establish righteous laws, equity, mercy, and Justice, and
true liberty in its place, and then you need not fear what man can do unto you,
for the Lord would then be your preserver.

So the Lord God has once more tried you; Now if you love Father, Mother,
Wife, Children, Houses, Lands, Commissions, Honors of the World, or any
particular self-end whatsoever more then the Work of the Lord, or if ye prefe^
any of them so as thereby to stop the Lords Work, or if ye do the Lords work
negligently (which he has once more pu^ into your hands) verily ye shall not
be counted worthy to be the Lords workmen.

So remember Saul (who was made an example that others might take warning) who
slew but part, (of that which was to be destroyod) and saved a part alive, and
therein he was stubborn and disobedient; Now if ye should destroy but part of
the Tyranny and oppression which is utterly to be destroyed, [Mark that] and
preserve part of it, take heed least the Lord rent ye from your places for your
stubbornness, and disobedience, as he rent Saul from his Kingdom, for his.

Therefore awake, awake, and wait in the light, to feel the Lords strength,
that therein your zeal and courage for him may be renewed, and linger not in
things as ye have done, but dwell in the power of the Lord, (ye who have felt
it, and do not abuse it, or resist it any longer) and in his power act for the
freedom and just liberty of all his Creatures, and this will bring honor unto
the Lord, that so ye in whose hearts there is a singleness, an honesty and an
uprightness unto the Lord, (may keep your selves from being defiled with the
corruptnesse of others) and so be preserved in his wisdom and power, in the
breakings, overturnings, or purgings, and separating, that yet must be in the
Nation.

And Friends in the Army, when will the spirit of Righteousness and equity be
clearly manifested among you, to Rule you thus, that so long as ye bear an
outward sword, it might be only turned against evil doers, and not for the
upholding any oppression whatsoever, but for the breaking down of all
oppression and Tyranny wheresoever it is found, and for keeping the outward
peace, whilst equal and just Laws be established, whereby the just liberties
and outward freedom of the Nation might be enjoyed; and not to make a trade of
using your swords to enrich your selves by them, by heaping up outward riches,
and to feed your lusts; But whilst ye use your swords, to be content with such
wages, as might but even find you things necessary and convenient for your
places?

Now if this spirit lead you, then self-denial will be manifested in you
indeed, and they that called you a mercenary Army, then should be ashamed; for
if tyranny and oppression were destroyed, and equity, true outward liberty and
freedom were established, and the enemies of it so brought to n^ught, that so
there were no need of you, this spirit if it ruled you, would make you as
freely wiling then, to lay down your places and swords, as ever any of you were
made free to take them up; and then to fall upon improving the Creation in the
fear and wisdom of the Lord, and to be content to enjoy an equal proportion and
share of the liberty (with your fellow creatures) which you have fought for;
and if it were thus, then ye might truly be called the Common wealths-men, or
servants.

But if ye carry a sword, and expect and desire still to carry or uphold a
sword, to make a trade of (mark that) then I know you will not utterly bring
down oppressors, and oppression, and firmly establish outward liberty, though
ye could, least your trade should fall; Now if you do not act fingly for your
Nations good (and stand out of all self ends whatsoever) but still continue,
making a trade of using your swords, then you cannot truly be called the
Commonwealths Servants; but such as serves your selves, and such as are their
masters, though you receive wages of them.

And Friends, there are many things done lately in the name of the keepers of
the liberty of England; Now (Mark) ye should first make England a Free Nation,
and set it at liberty from all its oppression and bondage that it is in [before
ye take such a name upon you] and then in the fear and wisdom of the Lord, see
to preserve and keep its liberty, and then ye might truly be called the keepers
of the liberty of England, but if ye do not first set it at liberty, and then
keep it, and yet be called the keepers of the liberty of it, ye will be but
like unto those which had a name that they lived, and yet were dead and like
the false Christians who are puffed up with a name but are out of the nature
which belongs to the name.

This from me, who have a tender love going forth unto all, both in Parliament,
Army and others, who have any true breathings or desire (in them) after
Righteousness, Truth, Equity Mercy, Justice and true Judgment (which wait to
see set up and established;) And I honor the higher power, and am subject
thereunto where ever, or in whomsoever it does appear which Power has made me
a Watchman unto you, to warn you, and to watch for your souls and for peace;
And in obeying this Power, I am clear of, and free from the blood of all men.

G. F.

THE END.
