Men, Women, or Children.
RUptures or broken Bellies cured by a Traveller famous in Germany, and other
Countries; no Cure ^o Money, but for Trusses you may have them made easy, none
such made in England, as these be found by experience, with Hinges, Springs,
Joints, Screws, or plain, so easy and fit to go about your business without
any pain or trouble; he helps those at a distance, as well with directions, as
those in London, and helps those that cannot hold their Water, or bearing down
in their privy Parts, and makes strait Stockins, and Italian Locks; It is a
private Distemper, and suddenly go^, and many People keep it private until they
are spoiled, and know not where to go or send, therefore keep this Bill in your
House. Many Children be spoiled and undone by neglecting of them when they be
young; Therefore if any People of Quality are minded to have them in my House
for the better perfecting of the Cure, at reasonable terms. If any Doctor,
Surgion, or Apothecary do send their Patient to me for Trusses, they may be
very well fitted, and I do never meddle further with their Patient. Poor and
Advice for nothing, take it in time.
