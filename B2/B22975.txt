The Reader is desired to take notice that from William the Conqueror to this
Time having only Blazoned the Achievements of 9 Kings, it is because there
have been no more than so many variations in their Achievements; as for
instance, from William the Conqueror, unto K. Stephen, the Achievements were
the same; so from Edward the 3d to Henry the 4th, and from him to Henry the
6th, and from him to K. James, and so of the rest; but those that desire to see
all the Achievements are referred to,

A Genealogy of the Succession of the Kings of England, from William the
Conqueror, unto our present King Char. the Second, printed upon a large sheet
of Imperial Paper, and adorned with all the Royal Achievements, Crowns, Arms
and Supporters, all which are truly Blazoned for their sakes who are lovers of
Herauldry, a work highly useful for the Reader of our English History, being so
contrived, that by the particular directing lines he will easily see how each
King has laid claim to this Crown; it is curiously engraven, and nothing
omitted that might render it very ornamental, first collected, and after
revised by Edw. Cook of the Middle Temple, Esquire; price 1 s. 6 d. Sold by Tho.
Simmons, at the Princes Arms in Ludgate Street.
