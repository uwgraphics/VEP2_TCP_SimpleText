The Court-Miss Converted: OR, A Looking Glass for Ladies.
Her former errors she does now repent,
And with unfeigned tears the same lament;
Resolving now a godly life to lead.
And in such wicked paths no more to tread:
Which may a good example be to all;
To rise from sin, if they by frailty fall.
Tune of, Englands fair dainty Dames.




WHen Phoebus with his Beams,
gilded the Christial Day,
I heard a mournful voice,
thus to lament and say,
You Ladies of Renown,
give ear unto my Song;
Because that unto you
it chiefly does belong.
Of Noble Parentage
it is known that I was born,
And those of low Degree,
too much I held in scorn
In my fresh blooming years,
Pride did possess my mind;
For costly Rich attire,
I sought always to find.
My Glass it was my Book,
wherein I took delight;
^^t I used to look,
from morning until night.
And for to tell the truth,
whilst I was in my prime;
My Beauty did excel
most Ladies fo my time.




GAllants of high Degree,
came me for to behold;
And often presented me
with Chains of beaten gold.
Happy he thought himself,
that could my favor gain;
For I was nice and coy,
to all that ever came.
At length my beauty bright,
was noised in the Court;
A place of great delight,
where Gallants do resort.
Then was I sent for straight,
by some of high degree,
Who then did for me wait,
and took delight in me.
Such pleasure there I took,
as did rejoice my heart;
All virtue I forsook,
which did procure my smart.
The life I there did lead,
grieves me to think upon,
For every day I was
treated by many one.
Until my Conscience it
began for to awake;
And put me in the mind,
that lend life to forsake.
Then from those vain delights,
I did my self withdraw;
Resolving for to live,
up to Gods Holy Law.
In heart I do Repent,
my youthful Vanities;
Praising the Lord that sent
his light into my eyes.
Now from all filthy vice,
I purpose to refrain,
And with Repentant tears,
to wash away my stain.
And in my Closet I
daily will pardon crave,
And to the Lord will cry,
that he my Soul will save.
Let my Example teach
Ladies of each degree:
Those sins for to avoid,
which wrought my misery.
For Pride will have a Fall,
and Beauty is but vain:
Strive on the Lord to call,
and from all vice refrain.
I wish all sinners they,
do keep these words in mind:
That so therein they may
some comfort daily find.
