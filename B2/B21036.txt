A Tale of a TVB, or The Greenwich PROBLEM. diagram
GREENVVICH, the Twenty sixth of July, 1673.
THe Dimensions of Mr. Peter Cooper his third Round Tun, taken in Inches by N.
G. and M. D.

Data The Diameters at the top 118 and 120.5; the Geometrical Mean 119.24 = A A.

The Diameters at the bottom 121.5 and 127; the Geometrical Mean 124.21 = B B.

The Perpendicular from the top to the bottom 46.5 = P P.

After these Dimensions were taken in the dry Tun, there was (upon the Fifth of
December, 1674.) water 2:1:5 two Barrels, one Firkin, five Gallons, put in to
replete the Horizon; and then at the Extremities of the Diameter C C, on the
Surface of the water, there was taken wet the Depths C D = 2 and C D = 2.





But the Frustum A A C C A found by Art = 50:3:7 and the Frustum C C B B C
measured by water = 2:1:5 is the whole Content of this Tun in Beer Measure =
53:1:3 not 54:0:3.

The Dimensions of the said Tun as they were taken in Inches the Fifth of
December, 1674.

Data The Diameters at the top 117.3 and 120.5; the Geometrical Mean 118.88 = A
A.

The Diameters at the bottom 125.5 and 126.75; the Geometrical Mean 126.12 = B
B.

The Perpendicular from the top to the bottom 46.4 = P P.

After these Dimensions were taken in the dry Tun, there was water 2:1:5 put in
to replete the Horizon; and then at the Extremities of the Diameter C C, on the
Surface of the water, there was taken wet the Depths C D = 2 and C D = 2.





But the Frustum A A C C A found by Art = 51:1:6 and the Frustum C C B B C
measured by water = 2:1:5 is the whole Content of this Tun in Beer Measure =
53:3:2 not 54:1:3.



viz. the Perimeter at the Croes, I do not mean the whole Surface of the
bottom) be granted to be in one and the same Plane, I do aver, that this way of
Casting up of this Tun is true to any way or every way of Casting of it up.



viz. the Perimeter at the Croes, I do not mean the whole Surface of the
bottom) and those on the Surface of the water: So then, if the Croes be not
granted to be in one and the same Plane, there is no way afforded to get the
Diameters on the Surface of the water, but by taking of them actually; which
all Practical Gaugers judge very uncertain and impracticable.

The reason that the Casting of December 5. 1674. exceeds that of July 26.
1673. is, for that the Diameters of the bottom are not Rectangular Conjugates,
and I judge may be said to be an insufficient Data, because July 26. shows a
longer and a shorter upon the same bottom.
