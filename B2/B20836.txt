A DECLARATION OF Oliver Cromwell, Captain General of all the Forces of this
COMMONWEALTH.
WHereas, the Parliament being dissolved, Persons of approved Fidelity and
Honesty, are, according to the late Declaration of the 22th of April last, to
be called from the several parts of this Commonwealth to the Supreme
Authority; And although effectual proceedings are, and have been had, for
perfecting those Resolutions; yet, some convenient time being required for the
Assembling of those Persons; It has been found necessary, for preventing the
mischiefs and inconveniences which may arise in the mean while to the Public
Affairs, that a Council of State be constituted, to take Care of, and intend
the Peace, Safety, and present Management of the Affairs of this
Commonwealth: which being settled accordingly, the same is hereby declared and
published, to the end all persons may take notice thereof; And, in their
several Places and Stations, demean themselves peaceably, giving obedience to
the Laws of the Nation, as heretofore. In the Exercise and Administration
whereof, as Endeavors shall be used that no oppression or wrong be don to the
people; so a strict Account will be required of all such as shall do any thing
to endanger the Public Peace, and Quiet, upon any pretense whatsoever.

O. CROMWELL.
April the last. 1653.
