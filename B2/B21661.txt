others. 1651.

BY THO. ELSLYOT, Armig. Arm. Conq.

Imprinted at LONDON. 1652.

To the honorable Judge-Advocate and Court Martial, now sitting at White Hall.
THe true, just, and humble Remonstrance, Charge, and Petition of Robert
Kindersly Gent. and Trooper in Captain Elsmores Troop, in Colonel Rich's
Regiment; on his own behalf, and on the behalf of diverse of his
fellow soldiers in the said Troop, in pursuit of his Petition presented unto
this honorable Court upon Monday the 22 of this instant December. 1651. against
William Stevens, now or late a Constable, and his wife; John Wilton, Gardener;
Richard S^nders, Instrument-maker; Maurice Ford, Victualler; Richard Lowther
Gent. and William Caldwel an Informer, and Thomas Brown Labourer; all living in
or about Spittlefields in the Parish of Stepnie-heath in the County of
Middlesex, inhabitants or members, within, or of, this present Commonwealth,
but malignantly affected to the present Government the^eof, as may appear by
the sequel.

And first, your Petitioner remonstrateth unto this honorable Court. That
whereas the honorable Parliament of England, being the supreme Judicatory of
this Nation, has been heretofore necessitated, for their defense, and all
Powers set up by them; as namely, for the defense of the Council of State; and
High Court of Justice, daily threatened by the late Tyrant and his son, and
their evil counselors, and several other traitors and evil affected persons,
such as be Papists, Malignants, Delinquents, and other enemies and opposers of
the honorable proceedings of Parliament, and the Powers aforesaid, for the
preservation of the Keepers of the Liberties of England by authority of
Parliament, To raise an Army sometimes under the command of their Excellencies
the Earl of Essex and the Lord Fairfax, but now under the command of Oliver
Cromwell Esquire; Captain General of all the English Force, and Lord Governor of
Ireland; and the General Officers of the Army being men of approved wisdom,
fidelity, and courage, for their regulating, disciplinating, and commanding of
the Soldiery thereof, in their several orders and stations, to the great
honor of Almighty God, glory of the Parliament, and State of this Nation, and
the good of the present Commonwealth.

And your Petitioner further remonstrateth unto this honorable Court, That
whereas not only all Heathenish but Christian Armies in this present world,
have been in all ages, and at this present time be disciplinated, conducted,
and commanded (as exigencies of affairs from time to time be incident, unto
their motions and stations either in Field or Garrison) and have been, and now
are, ordered and governed by Military and Civil Law and Government, not by any
Legal, National, or Common Law whatsoever: by means whereof, it has of late
pleased divine providence always to go along with them, and own them, and the
Parliament of England's just Cause, against all their opposers, maugre all
their enemies.

And your Petitioner further remonstrateth, That whereas the honorable
Parliament of England, about the 12 of August last past, getting notice of the
last Invasion of the Scottish Army, assisted with certain English Fugitives,
taking for their Head that Traitor Charles Stewart the younger, were pleased to
publish and declare an Act of Parliament to the people of this Nation, to
admonish them to be cautious in adhering unto him and his party, or to be any
ways deluded by them, under the penalty of High Treason; and for three months
time gave power to any Court Martial lawfully authorized by this prefent Army
under the now-General's Command, to take cognizance thereof, and to proceed
with the said persons so offending against the said Act to sentence, by the
Rules of a Court Martial (which be Military and Civil, as aforesaid) at any
time within three months, as by the said Act, hereunto annexed, may appear.

And your Petitioner lastly Remonstrateth unto this Honorable Court, that Col.
Rich, a Colonel, and a worthy Member of the Parliament, and of this present
Army, having about the beginning of October last, received certain Intelligence
from the Soldiery and diverse others, well affected Persons unto the
Parliament, Army and State, That the said Stevens and his wife, Wilton Sanders,
Ford, Caldwel, Brown, and others, had spoken and most maliciously uttered
certain Malignant, dangerous, and pernicious words, against the Parliament,
Council of State, and Army, in saying that they were a company of Rogues; And
that they the said Malefactors would not submit to their Government by them
Established in this present Commonwealth, unless it were under the Tr^itor
Charles Stewart the younger, the King of Scots, whom they called King Charles the
Second, or words to that effect: whereupon, the said Colonel Rich, like a wise
Senator of the Parliament of England, and Member of this present Army, did give
Order unto your Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers, he being their Superior in
order to Military Discipline, forthwith to scise and apprehend the aforenamed
evil affected persons, if they could be found, and to bring them before him, to
be proceeded with according to Justice, and to disarm them, and to seize their
Arms for the use and benefit of the Parliament, State and Commonwealth, as it
was just and Lawful for him to do; and your Petitioner and his fellow
Soldiers in obedience unto their Colonels Lawful Command being their
Superior, did forthwith repair unto the said evil affected persons houses, to
make dilligent search for their persons, and where your Petitioner and his
fellow Soldiers were opposed, they broke open their doors and houses in
pursuit of their Lawful Command, and not finding of their persons, did secure
such Arms as they found in their houses, for the use and benefit of the
Parliament, State and Commonwealth, as they hope it was Lawful for them to do,
under the favor of this Honorable Court; but the said evil affected persons
with the advice of the said Lowther, altogether machinating and despising the
Authority of Military Discipline, and of this Honorable Court, did lurk and
play at bo-peep from and with your Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers, until
the 3 Months limited in the said Act by Martial Discipline were elapsed; and
then to color their Malefactions and to bring dishonor and an odium upon your
Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers, being Members of this present Army, and so
consequently upon the whole Army and the Military Discipline thereof; they the
said evil affected persons did lately privily repair unto the Sessions House at
Hixes Hall, held before the Justices of Peace in the County of Middlesex, this
last present Sessions, and did there maliciously prefer an Indictment of
Burglary and Felony against your Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers for the
Premises to the Grand Inquest, Sworn for the Presentiments and Indictments for
the County against Malefactors and evil doers; and upon their false Testimony
given to the said Grand Inquest, the said evil affected persons procured the
said Bill of Indictment of Burglary and Felony, so presented by them against
your Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers, to be found billa vera; and not
therewith content, the said evil affected persons caused the said Bill so
found, to be transmitted from H^xes Hall, unto the Sessions House in the Old
Bailey, and thereupon procured a Warrant from the Recorder and Bench, and
another from the said Louther, directed to all Constables, Head-Burrows, and
other Officers of the Common Law of this Land, for the present apprehending of
your Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers, in all Quarters of London, Middlesex,
or Westminster, And by color thereof have not only broken open your Petitioner
Kindersties house in the Parish of St Giles's Cripplegate, to the great
astonishment and affrightment of his Wife and Family; but have also at sundry
times since attempted to seize upon your Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers
persons by color of the said Warrant, when they have been upon the Guard of
the Honorable Parliament of England at Westminster, the Council of State at
White Hall, in their Horse-quarters at the Muse, and in passing through the
streets of London, the Armies Garrison, to the great dishonor of the
Parliament, Council of Sta^e and Army, and of this Honorable Court, and of all
Military Discipline, and to the terror, discouragement, and amazement of diverse
of the Soldiery of the Army, who have seriously protested, That rather then
they will see the Army so affronted, and the Soldiery thereof so abused, they
will lay down their Arms, and bear no more for the defense of the Parliament,
Council of State and Commonwealth of England, since they cannot obey the
Lawful Command of their Superiors, but to be reputed Burglars, Felons and
thieves of this present Commonwealth, for the advancement whereof they have
adventured their Lives, Bloods and fortunes. And of the truth of this Charge,
your Petitioner as well on his own behalf, as on the behalf of his fellow
Soldiers, does hereby offer to hazard his life to make good by due process, the
verity thereof.

And therefore he humbly prays, as in his Petition upon Monday last he did
pray (that is to say) that your Petitioners Cause may be duly examined
according to Law Military and Civil in this Honorable Court, and that the said
evil affected persons may be forthwith sent for, and secured (and that the
truth of this appearing) upon due proof, that they may be made exemplary to
future Ages, for the Honor of this present Army and Soldiery thereof, by the
Justice of this Honerable Court, and that in the mean time, that their
malicious proceedings upon their Indictment at the Common Law against your
Petitioner and his fellow Soldiers, may be staid; and your Petitioner will ever
pray for the Justice of this Honorable Court, and remain a faithful Soldier to
the Noble General and Army of the Commonwealth of England, whilst he lives to
be

Robert Kinderslie.
This is a true Copy of the Original Charge delivered upon Saturday night,
the 27th of this instant December 1651. to the Honorable Judge Advocate, and
was read upon Wednesday at a Court Martial at White Hall the last of December
last, and does remain upon Record to future Ages, and to express to the English
Nation, the Authority of Military Disciplince, justly and anciently belonging
to Armies,
