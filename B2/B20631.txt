THE ROD OF RECOMPENSE OR THE HAND OF JUSTICE.

In the Punishment of the ENEMIES of CHURCH and STATE, BY Gods Providence and
Justice brought about, after they had by the space of eighteen years afflicted
and tormented both.

Written by JOHN CONSET, D. in Physic.

PSALM 9.16. The Lord is known to execute Judgment, and the wicked shall be
trapped in the work of his own hands.

For the poor shall not always be forgotten, the patient abiding of the meek
shall not perish for ever.

For when he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers it, and forgets not
the complaint of the poor.

London, Printed by T. R. for the Author, A. D. 1660.

THE ROD OF RECOMPENSE OR THE HAND OF JUSTICE.
I
THE branch which late I reached to the just,
Portending Peace
And much increase
Of hap to those who must
Acknowledge Gods high power in Restoration,
Of them and theirs from this late desolation.
Its message ended, now becomes a rod
Of Recompense to those, who man or God
Of late contemned, counting nothing holy
Which did not tend to the advance of their folly.
Nor spared to scourge with insolence the just,
And them to trample in the abject dust.
These Nimrods now by a most just succession,
Must mount the scene to answer their oppression.
II.
Thus have you seen the Providence divine
From captive thrall
Of late recall,
And end their woes in fine
Who did with patience kiss their Sovereigns hests,
Them daigning for a while (to be oppressed)
Unto their Tyrant foes to give: But lo,
How he rewards their patience, and how
He crowned their sufferings with much consolation,
And clears their innocence by this Restoration.
III.
Whilst those who late their stern oppressors were,
Are captive made,
And in a shade
Of pensive dreary care
Benighted, and their horrid guilt loud cries
For vengeance on their retchless Butcheries
And Providence reads lectures of Instruction
To after-Ages; in their just destruction.
IV.
Not long it is since the black lines of woe,
Did much ore cloud
And sore enshroud
By this our common foe,
Those radiant Beams of Royal Majesty,
Which erst enlightened faithful loyalty:
As Phoebus fills the lesser stars with light,
Whose sole Eclipse benights their glory bright.
V.
But now the radiant beams from Gods high favor,
The Eclipse remove,
And in his love
He (appearing a Savior
To King and people) those black lines out-raced,
Their comely visage which had so defaced;
And brings on the Scene their active cruel foe,
Which thus had drawn on them these lines of woe.
VI
Not long it is since these black sons of error
Rebellious Fry
And progeny
And to just men a terror
Mounted on their usurped Throne did shine
With rays of Pomp and Triumph; But in fine
Their luster proves like that which does proceed
From those false fires which mists and vapors feed.
VII.
Mean while these meteors daily breath out woe,
Or captive thrall
To the loyal
Who in their tract to go
Refuse; and therefore cruel servitude,
Or vassa lage to them they do conclude.
Nay death and Martyrdom must be their end,
Who to their rage will not assistance lend.
VIII.
But now behold these Titans brought to thrall
By those who late,
Did satiate
By their distress and fall.
The spleen and envy of these Tyrants fell,
Who now must change their Throne into a cell:
Their Triumphs into Dirges must they turn,
And those who long have laughed, must learn to mourn
From whence they came, to that they must return.
IX.
Like Insects they from corrupt matter came,
By the heat of War
And cruel jar
Late brooded, to the same
Must they dissolve like those Egyptian flies,
Bred but to plague our Country for its vice:
But through repentance God has them remanded,
Back to their cells again, when the judgement's ended
X.
Their threas must they into petitions change,
Who did rejest
With dire aspect
( When others torments strange
Enforced to sue for mercy) their Petition;
And charged them (Loyal) with some foul sedition.
Steeling their faces with harsh lines of Terror,
Miscalling truth with Epithites of error;
These may entreat, but iu^tly are forlorn;
Their Terrors turned into contempt and scorn.
XI.
These are the men who trusted not in God,
But in their strength
And at the length
Did sway the ruling rod.
And rather chose sins pleasures for a season,
Might their enjoyments be, though haughty treason
Against God and man the same conferred, than dure
Affliction with Gods people, who abjure
XII.
That gain or pleasure which with Gods behest
Does not agree
But when they see
What to their souls seems best
Do choose it, though clag'd with clods of affliction,
Or veiled and shadowed with clouds of dejection.
For well they know, that to their present grief
Joy shall succeed, and they shall find relief.
XIII.
But these, believe not God for future good
But what they see,
They take to be
The only chiefest good.
And wholly bend their thoughts that to attain
(Gods hests neglecting) make their God their gain,
To which they sacrifice their whole endeavor,
And by this homage from their Maker sever,
Only in word they will own Him; but in deed,
Their own devices, not his word, they will creed.
XIV.
They spared no ill to bring about their end,
Be It King to kill,
Or other ill
Whereto their actions tend
They wallow in all worldly joys, and still
(As if no God there were) their Genius fill
With all delights; Gods Word they only used
As servant to their lusts, thus it the abused.
XV.
And since they saw no Judgment them ore take,
As if Gods word
Did not afford
A Rule for us to make
Our Guide to holy life, they laid aside,
And their success they make their only guide
To prove Gods approbation, but behold
Their Mediums bad, and their conclusion cold.
XVI.
Lo he who against his Sovereigns life did plead,
And did attain
He should be slain,
Who was our chief and head.
He for his own life pleads, but is denied,
Since at his instance our dear Sovereign died.
He could not happy be while Charles did live,
Nor we, except to him his meed we give:
His passed sweets must we repay with sour,
His Sunshines turned to Tempests tossing shower.
XVII.
And he whose frothy Rethorick did move
By subtle words
Which naught affords
But shows of what they love.
The silly ones (to second his design)
Their Rings, their lives and all for to resign
To his disposal, lo now he wants breath,
Or words to plead, and save himself from death.
XVIII.
Full often has this Miscreant abused
That sacred place,
Whence rays of Grace
By Gods Word are diffused
Amongst poor Mortals them to light into
The way of Peace, there did he choose to do
His Antic Pageants; making it a stage
Of Drollery to the profane phrantique age.
God thus permitting him uncurb'd to run
From ill to worse, till the height of ills he had done,
And last the Guardon af those ills has won.
XIX.
And those who erst in pomp and Triumph led
Armies at Will
Do now want skill
To guard their tottering head.
Their force is scattered, and their Armie's shaken,
For Gods just judgment has them overtaken,
Their valors daunted, and their Crafts out-vi'd,
And their designs made void on every side.
XX.
For he who from his Throne beholds all,
Which under the Sun
By man is done,
Or on this stable ball
Does come to pass, permits man's cursed invention
Sometimes to take effect, but with intention
When he his whole achievement has attained,
And the sum of all his wicked hope has gained,
To let him see his hand can quickly foil
His greatest Fortress, and it give to spoil.
XXI.
When therefore you oppression do behold
Within a land
Long time to stand,
Let not your faith be cold.
But know who heaven, and earth, and all has made,
(Though long he suffer) yet by him's ore swaid
The powers therein contained; and 'its He,
Who all Oppressors and un^ust does see,
And will in time their injuries repay,
Avenge their wrongs at last, though long he stay.
XXII.
Most true it is we had deserved his ire
Against his hest
(For ever blessed)
By our rebellion dire,
With haughty spirits spurning, and with scorn
Rejecting his commands; His patience worn
With our rebellious wanton carriage, turning
To wrath and fury, against our vices burning.
XXIII.
Therefore he gave us to the Philistim
To be dejected
And afflicted
By their tortours grim,
Who spoiled our houses, and our lands did take
To their possessions, and our Church did make
A Den for foxes, or for Owls a nest.
Our selves their Captives whom they robbed of rest,
Our women from their pleasant places they
Cast out, and made our joys become their prey.
XXIV.
Thus were we toyled with fell servitude,
Until at length
God showed his strength,
Our sorrows to conclude.
And did remove from us his scourging hand,
When gained the end of his Afflictions, and
Reclaimed us from sinning, then he throws
Into the fire of vengeance these our foes;
Whom by success he made a Rod to us,
Now burns the same, our woes concluding thus.
XXV.
Let not therefore Gods patience you incite
With violence
To innocence
To offer shrewd despite.
For sure you shall by woeful trial find,
He all your wrongs will treasure up in mind,
And at the length, he vengeance on your head
Will feirce repay, either alive or dead.
XXVI.
Now since, O Lord, thy justice does thus sure
Avenge all wrong
Which here is done,
And does also procure
In spite of ill relief to the wronged flock,
Who fly to thee as their faiths surest rock.
Let us beware how we do thee provoke,
To lay on us thy scourge, and fatal stroke.
And let us in faith and fear wait for thy favor,
That here and after thou may be our Savior.
AMEN.
DEO GLORIA.
