This is to all people who stumble at Gods Commands.
Yea to all you who stumble at the Commands of God, you are not guided by the
light, which lead into the Covenant of God, obeying and loving it, if you love
the light, which does not change but is eternal which brings to see before the
world was, all the desires which are acted in that nature which hates the
light, with the light in the particular, if thou love it they are all judged,
and the affections crucified, then the pure Commands of God are walked in, and
that pure eternal ligh^ which judges in the particular all the deceits
within, that nothing may reign but that which is pure, and clean, and holy,
and just, and good, and perfect and upright, and these are the fruits that slow
from that which is pure, and holy, and from it joy proceeds, and no desires of
the flesh, no^ motions of it is followed who dwells in the light, but with the
light they are all judged, and condemned, and the affections crucified which be
earthly; no Jew in the flesh shall here reign in the Letter; but with the power
all that is earthly is condemned, and that which is changeable judged, with
that which changes not, which guides to God, here is the way of pleasantness,
and here you shall all know the movings of the Lord are pure, the holy when it
moves, being obedient, ye receive strength dwelling in the pure, and walking
in the Commands of God, and standing still in the patience, where the will is
kept out with the light, but to thee whose mind is turned from the pure light,
yet thou art convinced, but thy love is in the world, in the flesh, and deceit
is strong, some thing moves thee to turn within, but thou reasonest, and so
disobeyest the pure, then thou have no^ peace, then motions arises in the
flesh, and then thou will go and do something in thy own will to make thy
peace, and when thou have done thou have no peace, and when thou do not thou
have no peace for this to thee I say, it is not justifiable in the sight of
God, but with the light which is pure, it is all to be condemned, and with the
light which does not change, thou art to be condemned, and all thy forming
obedience as thou call it, and all thy desires which is acted in that
nature, which is turned from the light which is pure, with the light is to be
condemned, and here the eye is single, the other is not, the movings of the
Lord is pure, and deceit is not, so with the pure, it is all to be condemned,
the word of the Lord is pure where the burden is upon it, it is for the seeds
sake in others, till it be cast off, that which burdens is that which is to be
cast off, here learn judgment, and understanding, to thresh down that which
vailes; that, that which burdens may be thrown out with the pure eternal,
which leads out of time, the love from that which is pure is not seigned, but
is everlasting, as God is love, love flows from the light, this is not
feigned, but all you whose minds is turned from the light; a liberty there gets
up, a fleshly joy, a feigned love speaking high things, but this shall wither,
and with the light all this is to be condemned, and for judgment, and the jar,
and the strife is without, and you all who are turned from the pure light which
is eternal, and does not change, you are in your own wills and what you do is
in your own wills; and when you have done you have not peace, and when you do
not you have no peace, and all your motions are from the fleshly mind, which
with the light is all to be condemned, which loving it, and walking in it, it
keeps single and pure, and following it, there is no stumbling, it shows the
way of life, and waiting in it, power is given, and strength, and being
obedient to it, and faithful in a little, you will grow up to be rulers over
much (and the word of the Lord to all you, that are turned from the light in
your consciences and acts contrary to it) (whose minds are gone into the earth,
w^o is compassing Sea, and Land to make a profession in that nature which is
gone from the light, and acts contrary to it,) with the light you are
comprehended and seen, (woe) from the (...) ^t does against you proceed, that
is your portion.
