The Loyal Conquest Or, Destruction of Treason, A SONG
To the Tune of, Lay by your Pleading, the Law ly's a Bleeding.
NOW Loyal Tories
May Triumph in Glories,
The Fatal Plot is now betrayed,
The Rest were Shams and Stories.
Now against Treason,
We have Law and Reason;
And every Bloody Whigg must go,
To Pot in Time and Season.
No Shamming, nor Flamming,
No Ramming, nor Damming,
No Ignoramus Jury's now,
For Whiggs, but only Hanging.
II.
Look a little farther,
Place things in order,
Those that seek to Kill their King,
Godfrey might Murder.
Now they are Detected,
By Heaven Neglected;
In black despair cut their Throats,
Thus Pluto's Work's effected.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
III.
Catch grows in Passion,
And fears this New Fashion;
Lest every Traitor hang himself,
And spoil his best Profession.
Though four in a Morning
Tyburn Adorning;
He Cries out for a Score a time,
To get his Men their Learning:
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
IV.
Now we have sounded
The bottom which confounded,
Our Plotting Parliament of late
Who had our King surrounded.
Hamden and others,
And Trencher were Brothers;
Who were to kill the King and Duke,
And hang us for the Murders.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
V.
Surprising the Tower
And Court, in an Hour,
And enter at the Traitors Gate,
But was not in their Power.
O now Guards are Doubled,
E're long they will be Tripled,
The Harmony of Gun and Drum,
Makes Guilty Conscience Troubled.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
VI.
If Gray is Retaken,
The Root of the Plot is shaken,
Russel and the rest Condemned,
The Bleeding Cause to waken.
Monmouth in Town still
With Armstrong his Council;
The Lady G -- may find him out,
Under some Smock or Gown Still.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
VII.
Give 'em no Quarter,
They Aim at Crown and Garter,
They Are of that Bloody Regiment,
That made their King a Martyr.
Leave none to breed on,
They Would make us to bleed on;
They are the bloody'st Caniballs
That ever man did Read on.
No Shamming, nor Flamming,
No Ramming, nor Damming,
No Ignoramus Jury's now,
For Whiggs, but only Hanging.
