WHEREAS We are informed that diverse of His Majesty's Subjects in several parts
of this Kingdom, being possessed with strange fears and groundless jealousies,
have frequently of late deserted their own dwelling Houses, and have resorted
either to Castles or other places of Strength, or into the Fields or Woods in
the nightime, under color of securing themselves from dangers, which
(considering the quiet and peaceable condition this Kingdom is in) there is no
reason for them to apprehend; We think fit hereby to Require and Command all
His Majesty's subjects in this Kingdom, to forbear all unlawful meetings in the
nightime, and other disorderly assembling of themselves together, and that
they do quietly and peaceably demean themselves, following their several
Callings and Employments, and not forsaking their own Habitations, upon
pretense of any such groundless Fears or Apprehensions; as they will answer the
contrary at their perils; We being resolved, by His Majesty's Authority
wherewith We are entrusted, sufficiently to provide for the Security and
Preservation of all His Majesty's Subjects, both in their Persons, Estates, and
Possessions, according to the Laws of this Realm, which We shall take care to
see duly executed, for the Safety and Protection of all His Majesty's faithful
and obedient Subjects, and the Terror and Punishment of all Disturbers of their
Peace and Quiet.
