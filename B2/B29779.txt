A SHORT DISCOVRSE, tending to the Pacification of all unhappy differences,
between His Majesty and His PARLIAMENT.
Showing the means whereby the same may speedily be done, and that it rests in
His MAJESTY'S sole power to effect it.
Presented to the Consideration of all those that love the Truth and Peace: By
a friend and Servant to both.
THe Commons of England (That great Body) consisting of more then ten Millions
of living souls, having with great joy and hope waited now full twenty
Months, for the happy effects of this long desired Parliament; do now
perceive by His Majesty's Declarations to His Parliament, and His present
proceedings in opposition to their Counsels, they are like, not only to be
frustrated of those joys and hopes but to have Confusion and Ruin immediately
fall upon His Majesty, themselves, and this whole Kingdom by Civil Discord:
Whereof (^s living men) they cannot but be sensible; and having no better
means of access to His Majesty, are constrained in this common way to breath
out their Griefs and Fears, hoping in its Passage abroad, it may meet with
some great Man, who (in imitation of him that had Compassion upon the
Multitude) will convey it into His Majesty's Royal hand, of whose goodness
His People have had more then 16. years experience.

That by the wisdom and justice of His Majesty, the Fidelity, Loyalty, and
Duty of His Parliament, and the blessing of God upon both, those visible
miseries (hanging over this whole Kingdom) may speedily be removed and a
happy and blessed concord renewed and continued betwixt His Majesty and His
great Council, the representative body of this Kingdom.

The Commons do observe, that His Majesty in His Declarations does declare,
His intentions are not only to preserve His just Prerogative, Rights and
Privileges, due to His Crown but also to preserve His People and Kingdom in
peace and safety; and that His Subjects may also enjoy their Religion Laws,
Liberties Rights, and Privileges due and belonging to them and their
posterities.

They observe likewise, That the Parliament in their Remonstrances and
Declarations published to the whole world, do profess the very same thing to
be their ends and intentions concerning His Majesty his People and Kingdom:
For which His Majesty's gracious expressions as they are bound to give His
Majesty most humble thanks, so are they obliged in all duty and service to
those Noble Gentlemen, and others of their own choosing, not only for their long
continued and unwearied pains for the good of His Majesty, and this whole
Kingdom: but also for their fidelity, wisdom and care, so really expressed
and performed in discharge of that great trust they have committed to them
being no less then all that they and their posterities have or are, and to be
faithful to them in obedience to all their lawful commands tending to the
good and safety of His Majesty's Royal person, and His Kingdom.

These being the mutual, and (they hope) real intentions of His Majesty and
His Parliament concerning them, thus concurring in one, and published to the
whole world so to be: never (say they) was any Kingdom nearer to confusion (if
not destruction) under a coniuncture of so good intentions: And what Vipers, or
rather what Devils are there upon the earth, that by wicked Council would
divide those intentions, and bring desolation upon this whole Kingdom; and
what torments (less then hell) do such men merit. But their hope and
confidence is His Majesty's own goodness and care of His people, so often
expressed and published to the world, will be motive sufficient to turn His
ear from the Counsels of such wicked persons, and to join with His
Parliament in pursuit of those good intentions, and not for such men's sakes to
expose His own Royal person to danger, and His people and Kingdom to ruin.

They further observe, That it pleases His Majesty in His Declarations, to
charge the cause of all unhappy differences betwixt His Majesty and His
Parliament, upon some few turbulent ambitious Factious spirits in both Houses
of Parliament (Members thereof) whose cunning conveyance and carriage of
business in both Houses, for their own ambitious ends and advantage, have
procured so great a party in both Houses, that their Votes are become the
Parliament; and these men it is (says His Majesty) that make Orders and
Ordinances, displeasing to his Majesty being (as his Majesty affirms)
against the established known Laws of the Land, and His Majesty's just and
Royal Prerogative, warranted by those Laws.

They observe also, That the Parliament declare the cause of those differences
to be a wicked and pernicious Council about his Majesty (who are seldom
wanting about the Throne of the best and most pious Princes) being either
Atheists, Papists, and Jesuits, Delinquents, or men of desperate Fortunes,
engaged only to their own ends, though it prove the ruin both of King and
Kingdom. And of necessity one of these two parties it must fall upon: for his
Majesty's people do well know the goodness of his own disposition and
inclination to his Subjects, manifested out of his Royal breast in the
beginning of His reign, before this viperous brood had time to take hold of
Him; and call to mind His gracious expressions and actions toward His Subjects
in those times: And also His Majesty's frequent protestations and imprecations
made this present Parliament, of his Majesty's great care and good intentions
to preserve His people in peace, the true Protestant Religion, the Laws,
Liberties and Privilege of Parliament, from the least change or violation; and
therefore whatsoever the French Histories have recorded and published,
concerning congratulatory Letters, passed betwixt his Majesty and the Pope of
Rome, at His Majesty's being in Spain, they dare not admit the least thought
of change or alteration to be in his Majesty's own breast, but must cast it upon
one of the parties before named.

And therefore, for appeasing all differences, and prevention of all dangers,
ready to fall upon his Majesty, and this whole Kingdom, His People do most
humbly desire his Majesty, to do Himself, and His Kingdom that right and
justice (which lies in His own power to do) by naming such persons (if any
such be) Members of both or either Houses of Parliament, as his Majesty is
informed are the Men, who draw all this fear of misery on his Majesty and His
Kingdom, that they may come to Trial before the Parliament in a Parliamentary
way, and there receive judgment and punishment (if they shall be found guilty)
or otherwise, their Accusers, (who have so highly wronged his Majesty, His
Parliament, and People) may come to like trial and receive such punishment, as
the justice of that Court shall inflict upon them.

And for the same reasons, they would also most humbly beseech his Majesty to
name unto his Parliament, those persons near about his Majesty, who have been
or are his Majesty's Counselors, in expounding of Laws, framing, making and
penning of Declarations, Proclamations, Messages and Passages, betwixt his
Majesty and his Parliament (for his Majesty best knows who those men are) and
deliver them to the Parliament to justify their doings, which as it will most
magnify the honor of his Majesty to the love of truth and justice, so will it
be the clearest manifestation His Majesty can give of the reallity of his
Royal intention to His people, and lay the greatest obligation of duty love
and obedience, upon them, and all good Subjects that his Marestie can expect
from a loyal and true hearted people, which until his Majesty grant, their
fears will keep them restless.

These most humble desires, the Commons conceive to be so just, equal,
seasonable and fuitable to his Majesty's gracious disposition that in honor,
and justice, he will not deny them to His People, being (as they think) the
most hopeful means under heaven to secure his Majesty and his people, from
the approaching dangers and miseries of a bloody War, and to settle a firm
and lasting peace between his Majesty, his Parliament and People, which is that
his Majesty has so often taken the Almighty God to witness, is the thing he
so much desires; wherein the Commons are confident and will expect, that the
Lords and others of his Majesty's most honorable Privy Council and all the
Peers of this Realm, and others, attending his Majesty, who desire the safety,
peace and prosperity of his Majesty, his People and Kingdoms will ioyn with
them; and according to their relations offices, places, neernesse and credit
with His Majesty, will put forth their uttermost strength, Counsels and
endeavors to prefer and accomplish these their humble d^sires to His
Majesty, otherwise they must think (as they may have just cause) they are of
the Malignant party, more willing to behold all of them, and this whole
Kingdom streaming in blood, then relinquish their own pernicious Councels and
ends, and be ready to execute the Commands of the Parliament against them.

The differences themselves between His Majesty, and His Parliament, in His
Majesty's Declarations appear to be Four. First, Detaining His Town and
Magazine of Hull. Secondly, removing the Magazine and Arms thence to other
places, and the like in other parts of the Kingdom. Thirdly, Putting the
Militia in execution contrary to His Majesty's Proclamation. Fourthly, Making
of Leavies, and raising of Men, Horse and Money; And these all done by Orders
and Ordinances of Par-liament, and (as His Majesty's Declaration says) against
His Majesty's pleasure, because it is against the law, and His Majesty's
Prerogative, warranted by the law.

The only question then is, Whether these proceedings by both Houses of
Parliament in this time of danger (His Majesty having refused to join with
them) be against the fundamental laws of the Land, and His Majesty's
Prerogative warranted by those laws, and above the power, and privilege of
Parliament to meddle in for the safety of his Majesty's Royal Person His
Kingdom and people?

The Commons do all know His Majesty to be no expounder of laws (for so his
Majesty is pleased to profess) as belonging neither to his Person, nor
office, but therein to be guided by the judgment and counsels of others, to
whom His Majesty does commit that trust, To give right judgment betwixt His
Majesty and people; and what Counselors his Majesty has had, and what
expositions of Laws and Statutes have been made, during this present
Parliament; and how injuriously His Majesty, His Parliament and People, have
been dealt with therein, is like to appear in the Kingdoms confusion, if His
Majesty's goodness and wisdom, in casting off such Counsels, and speedy
joining with his Parliament prevent it not.

And what service such evil Counselors have done to this Kingdom in former
^ime, and what exposition of Laws they have made, let the Petition of Right,
granted by his Majesty to all his Subjects in ease of their Grievances
witness.

And what Counsels they have given, and exposstion of Laws they have made
ssnce that Petition granted, let Ship money coat, and Co^auct money, and many
other unjust and illegal impositions laid upon His Majesty's Subjects, and
Declared in the Parliaments Remonstrances witness also: And into what
condition such pernicious Counsels and Counselors, have brought this Kingdom
and His Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland, at this present, let the consuming
flames in the one, and the kindled fire in the other testify.

The Parliament, the Commons do know, and their Counsels, Votes, Ordinances,
Expositions and Declarations to His Majesty, and his People, they hear and
see attested under the authority of one or both Houses, and therefore are bound
in reason and duty to believe their Proceedings are warranted by the
Fundamental laws of the Land, and are according to the Power and Privilege of
Parliament, until the like or better authority appear to the contrary. For
those who expound the Laws to his Majesty and are his Counselors, they know
not their Persons or names, neither see their hands attesting the Counsels they
give, nor Expositions they make, which makes them suspect they are Men of
darkness, and such as flee from the light of Parliament. Wherefore it is the
most humble desire of all His Majesty's good Subjects, that His Majesty will
put no longer confidence in their Councels or expositions of Laws; but hearken
to the advice of his great Council the Parliament.

And whether it be more meet, safe, just and honorable, for his Majesty and
his Subjects to put confidence in the Counsels and judgments of such
Counselors, and the exposition they make of Laws, and the Power and
Privileges of Parliament, or in the Parliament, themselves being the great
Counsel of the Kingdom, and the makers of all Laws, the Commons beseech His
Majesty and all the World to judge.

As it is far from the heart of every good Subject to diminish the least part
of His Majesty's Royal Prerogative, due by the Laws and Statutes of the
Realm, being part of the inheritance of His Crown and descended to His
Majesty from His Royal Progenitors, Kings of this Realm, so are all Subjects
bound to maintain the Liberties, Rights and Privileges, due and belonging to
the Parliament and People of England, and the Laws that defend and preserve
the same, the one as being the just and undoubted inheritance of His Majesty,
the other as their inheritance as just and undoubtedly due to themselves and
their Posterities, granted to their Predecessors more then five hundred Years
past conrfimed to their Ancestors in all ages and not questioned or attempted
to be violated, until of late by the wicked Council, and fraud of ill
Ministers and Counselors (who for their own ends, and to obtain the favor of
Princes) have taken upon them the boldness, to advance the Prerogative above
Law, and endeavored to bring the Laws and the Power and Privileges of
Parliament, to such construction themselves would make, thereby at once
breaking in upon the Privileges of Parliament, and the inheritance of the
Subject, and so by pretense of Law, to root up the foundation of Law, the
Parliament it self.

The Commons do therefore most humbly beseech His Majesty that the
distractions, griefs and fears, of so many thousand thousands of His Loyal
Subjects laid before his Majesty, in this time of danger may prevail with His
Majesty speedily to return to His Parliament, and there in the way of justice
to examine all misinformations his Majesty has had, both of Persons and
Causes; and let all Offenders whatsoever, taste the severity of his Majesty's
justice, who have been Counselors, instruments, or actors, to make so great a
breach betwixt His Majesty and His Parliament, and put his Kingdom and People
into so much danger, and so many losses in their estates, by the long decay of
their Trading in all parts, caused by those divisions.

For the tumults which His Majesty seems to flee from, the Commons doubt not,
His Majesty will find his Parliament, and all good Subjects, most willing to
suppress and punish, all unlawful tumults and disorders caused by any Persons
whatsoever, when it shall please His Majesty to join with his Parliament, in
securing this and His other Kingdoms from the plots and designs of Jesuits,
Papists and other instruments of theirs, whose work it is now to disturb the
peace of his Majesty's Dominions, for preservation of their Spanish Monarchy,
and Popish Tyranny, by suppressing or destroying of Prince, Parliament and
People, that stand in their way: For the Commons would that all the world
should know They are English Protestants, whose Religion is not founded either
upon Superstirious Vanities, or Schismatic Fancies, but upon the revealed
will* and well warranted word of God consonant to the sound and Orthodoxe
Doctrine of the Church of England, whereunto They will always submit,
provided it may be purged from what gives just occasion of scandal or offense;
and not so mixed or adorned with Rights and Ceremonies, that whilst the Body
is dressed, the Soul of Religion, which is life and power, should be lost: For
God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth, which is the
Freedom they ask; without which, the Protestant Religion is but Protestant
Profession, will make men but seeming Saints, while Devils, and set them but
half the way to Heaven.

And if His Majesty shall not be pleased to hearken to these most humble
desires of His People, and make some present return for putting out those
Fires now kindled in this Kingdom, the woeful spectacle of their poor
Brethren in Ireland, will cause Them, (all that are able) to join with his
Parliament in obedience to their Commands, for the preservation of his Majesty,
his Kingdom and themselves from utter Ruin, nature it self having taught
Beasts, when storms are rising to provide for their own safety. But in hope
of His Majesty's gracious Answer, they will wait and pray for the long life,
and happy, and peaceable Reign of his Majesty.

FINJS.
