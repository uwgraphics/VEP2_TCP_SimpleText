TO THE Called of God, Who believes in the Light of the LAMB, To be read in
their Assemblyes in the Pure Dread of the Lord.
Dear Children and people of the eternal God, who have known the working of
his mighty power, and have been exercised in the operations of his Eternal
Spirit, whereby he has begotten your minds out of the world, in a great
measure, and has brought you into a feeling of his eternal presence, which
fills heaven and earth, wherein is the Joy unspeakable unto them that are
reconciled to God by the Lord Jesus Christ, the Immortal Word: Friends, you
unto me are exceeding precious, and my desires and breathings to the Lord for
you, are exceeding strong, that ye may be preserved in the sense and feeling of
the power of an endless life, and that you may be all kept in the true faith
and obedience of the truth, which lives for ever; all minding to answer its
requirings in every particular, and waiting to feel its springings arising in
you, whereby you may feel it quickening you up to God, that so your faith, and
trust, and confidence may only stand in him, who is able to deliver: For
Friends this know, the Lord will assuredly try you to the uttermost, and you
must come through the fire which will consume your enemies: Therefore dear
Babes be steadfast in the Lord according as he has made manifest himself unto
you, and wait and watch in that measure of his life in you, which only is able
to keep your minds and hearts out of the earth, and the things thereof, and as
ye singly wait upon the Lord, you will feel the growth of that birth in you,
which is not of this world, which can endure the fire; Oh my Friends wait to
feel your growth and translation into this birth, which does the will of the
Father naturally, this is the seed unto which the promises are, this is the
Elect which obtains, and cannot be deceived, this is the heir of the Kingdom
without end; this will God Crown with victory, when the measure of its
sufferings is fulfilled; this feed must work through all it is enemies, and work
them under it is feet; Oh wait in the eternal power to feel and witness it in
the particular, and be patient till God bring forth his work outwardly; Look
not out, neither be dismayed at the strange transactions of the times, but look
to the Lord, who only can save by what means he pleases, and let the Lord
alone to appear as he pleases; only be you watchful, that when he appears,
you may be ready for his appearance, and watch in the Light which will give you
clearly to see his appearance, and what he requires of you; that so living
obedience unto him may be yielded: Oh Friends, Take heed that the things of
this world draw not away any of your hearts: Remember it is them that are
redeemed from the earth, that must reign in, and with the Lamb upon the
earth: Take heed that your love stands not in any thing, or things that is of
this world; for the trial will be great unto such: Dear hearts, I know that
some of you have suffered the loss of much for his name sake already; oh faint
not, neither be weary for all your sufferings are known unto the Lord; and he
will not always so try you; but he will sufficiently recompense you, if ye
abide to the end: Therefore watch unto prayer, and pray in the Spirit, as it
moves you thereunto, that you may be kept through faith unto the end of the
trial, and that you may be prepared and made fit for the deliverance, which
must come by an outstretched Arm; and when you are tried deeply, either in
prisons or otherwise, oh Friends murmr not, but feel the Lords strength to
support you, that you may not bow to the enemy, in any wise, whose day is but
short, and therefore he is wroth and rages; for such as bows to any thing, but
the Name of our King, verily their torment and perplexity will be exceeding
miserable, when the Lord shall deliver his chosen, who kept their integrity,
and loved not their estates, nor lives, but gave up all for his name sake:
Therefore dear Friends hearken you to the voice of the Lord, and keep you to
the leadings of his eternal Spirit, and let his Dread fill your hearts.

And you that feel but little sufferings and trials, take heed of a wrong
security, and of a false ease and liberty, least the day of the Lord come upon
you at unawares, and a violent storm unlookt for; and you that are in deep
sufferings and trials, be not you cast down, but know that the trial of your
faith is exceeding precious, and if you keep your minds stayed upon the Lord,
then will you learn much in such a time, and you will feel the presence of
God, and the virtue of his power, inwardly refreshing you, and will feel the
power of his Majesty giving you Authority suitable to the condition you are in:
So as all Friends are kept in that which gives you the sense and feeling of
your conditions, that principle of life will work your minds and hearts into
contentedness with the will of God, which is your sanctification; So let the
bond of peace be minded in all things, for it is comely amongst Brethren.

And now the God of Life and endless virtue and power watch over you, and
minister unto every one of you, that which is suitable to your present
conditions, and the Lord God Almighty preserve and keep you low, humble, meek,
tender, innocent, upright, faithful and valiant, (out of the snares of the
enemy) and give you peace in all your trials; and let the patience of his Lamb
be increased in you, that you may stand unmovable upon the Rock of ages, and
retain the Life which quickens in your understandings: And the Lord God open
and keep open your discernings, that by no means the subtlety may beguile the
simplicity in this the day of trial: Eternal Father unto thee I commend all
thy flock, that thou Father may fill them with wisdom, strength and courage,
that to thy glory they may be preserved in their several places and measures;
to whom be dominion and glory everlasting for thy endless riches, for thou Lord
art worthy to reign over all; Even so come Lord God and take thy Kingdom.

I the prisoner for the Lord salutes all you, who loves the appearance of
Christ, in that love which abides for ever. George Fox the younger.
Lambeth house the 14th of the 5th month, 1660.
SUrely it was thee O Lord, that gave bounds unto the Sea, that the floods
thereof could not overwhelme thy chosen, thou can let forth the winds and
suffer a storm, and thou can make a calm when thou please, have thou the
glory of all, Thou King of Saints, thou Savior of Israel, thou can do
whatsoever thou please; therefore will we trust in thy name, neither will we
fear what man can do unto us, because thou will not forsake us, but thou will
plead our cause in the sight of our adversaries, and they shall know that thou
art our God, who art able to save to the uttermost; o Lord our righteousness,
we will praise thy name, for thy mercies endure for ever; our eyes O God are
unto thee, for we have no other helper; our faith o Lord stands in thee, who
can not forget thy people; Thou have revealed and brought up Jacob, who
wrestleth with thee, and prevails as a Prince, therefore must the blessing
come; o Lord the Birth, the Birth cries unto thee, thine own Elect, which long
has been oppressed; thou can not deny thy self, therefore have we faith and
hope which makes not ashamed, Oh Lord how unsearchable are thy ways; Thou
have even amazed thy people, with the depth of thy wisdom, thou only wilt have
the glory of their deliverance; and therefore have thou suffered these things
to come to pass: o Lord thou art righteous in all thy judgments, only
preserve thy people (which thou have gathered and wilt gather unto thy self)
in the day of trial, that so they may sing of thy Power, and magnify thy name
in the Land of the Living.

G. FOX
