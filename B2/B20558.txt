Roman Forgeries IN THE COUNCILS During the First Four CENTURIES. Together with
An APPENDIX Concerning the FORGERIES and ERRORS IN THE ANNALS OF BARONIUS.

West End of S. Paul's, 1689.

(...) many of that Order have not the, Advantage or the Opportunity to acquire
this Knowledge from the Original Authors, and therefore are forced to seek it
in the Roman Editions of the Councils, and the Modern Historians of that
Church: Where every thing is misrepresented and placed in so False a Light,
that its hard to find out what is Truth. Some of the genuine Remains of
Antiquity they have concealed, but they have falsified and altered more, and
added so much to the Primitive Records, especially in the first Four Centuries,
that near Three Parts of Four (both in Baronius and the Councils) are modern
Forgeries, manifest Legends, and impertinent Excursions into Sophistical
Vindications, of the later Doctrins and Practices of Rome. It would therefore
be a Work worthy of this excellent Church in so Learned an Age, to make an
acurate Collection of that, and only that which is true and certain in the
Primitive History and Councils. It Is true, diverse Eminent Men have made some
steps toward it; but it is too great an Undertaking for any One Man to
accomplish, as appears by that generous Project of Dr. Thomas James, Proposed
to the Most Learned Primate of Ireland, to employ a Select Company of both
Universities, with due Assistances and Encouragement for the perfecting this
Design: Wherefore in the mean time, it may be serviceable to gather together
some Materials for so Noble a purpose, and that first encouraged me to make
these Observations as I was Reading the Annals of Baronius with the Councils:
Which I have (by the Advice of some of my Friends) Methodically digested in
this little Tract; and I hope it may be useful, not only to direct such as
apply themselves to this kind of Study, but also to confirm others of Our own
Communion in their firm Adherence to their Excellent Religion, when they see so
many plain Evidences, That all the Roman Churches Pretenses to Antiquity (both
in Doctrine and Worship) are founded on, and maintained by little else, but
those Forgeries and Corruptions, by which they Imposed upon the Ignorant and
Easy World for Six or Seven Centuries together. These Pious Frauds (as They
counted them) did indeed then advance their Interest, and establish their
Errors; but now when they are detected by this Discerning Generation, they
prove their utter Shame; and did not Secular Advantages and Implicit Faith, or
Fear and Inquisitions hinder those under their Yoke from being acquainted, or
however from owning these unfaithful Actings of their Spiritual Guides; These
Discoveries would not only secure Our People, but make many Converts from Them.

But (My Lord) whatever the Work or the Success be, I am obliged to lay it at
Your Graces Feet, as the first thing I have made Public since Your Graces happy
Advancement to the Government of this Church, whereof I am a Member, and
wherein by Your Graces Influence I shall study to serve the
Primitive-Protestant-Church of England. Which I beseech Almighty GOD to defend
from all its Enemies, and long to preserve Your Grace, to be a Support and an
Honor to it. So Prays,

MY LORD, York, Aug. 20. 1689. Your Graces most Dutiful Son and Servant, THO:
COMBER.

THE Introduction.
WHen Campian long ago undertook to defend the Roman Cause, he boasted, that He
was strengthened with the firm and powerful Guard of all the Councils, and that
all the General Councils were on his side Campian. december rat. page 24, and 30.
, Which vain Brag the Writers from the Roman Church do frequently repeat to
this very day. But he that with Judgment and Diligence shall peruse their own
allowed Editions of the Councils, will easily discover the falsehood of this
Assertion: For there is such ^dding and expunging, such altering and disguising
things in the Body of the Councils, and such excusing, falsifying, and
shuffling in the Notes, that a Judicious Reader will soon perceive these
Venerable Records, truly set down and explained, do not favor them. But these
Corruptions are carried on with such Confidence and Cunning, that an
unexeperienced and unwary Student, may be imposed on by this specious show of
Venerable Antiquity: For their sakes therefore, it is necessary to take a short
view of that Fraud and Policy, which is so commonly made use of in those
Editions of the Councils which pass through the Roman Mint, especially in those
which are in most use among us, viz. The Edition of Severinus Binius Edit.
Binii Council. omn. Colon. 1618
, and that of Labbe and Cossartius Edit. Lab. and Cossart. Paris, An. 1671.
, wherein Binius his Notes are printed verbatim. Which useful design was begun
by a Learned and Ingenious Gentleman, in a Tract entitled Roman Forgeries,
printed at London, An. 1673: But that Author does not follow the exact order of
Time, nor does he go much beyond the Nicene Council, and even in that Period he
left out many plain Instances; And whereas he died, before he had proceeded any
further; I resolved to begin where he left off: But for Methods sake, and to
make this Discourse more entire, I have begun with the first Century, and so
proceeded according to the order of the several Councils (only writing more
briefly upon the Three first Centuries, which were largely treated of in that
Author before) deducing the account of these Impostures down to the end of the
Fourth Century, and showing (as I go along) what Artifices have been used by
the Editors and Annotator to dress up these Ancient Evidences, so as to make
them look favorably upon their great Diana, the Supremacy and other
Corruptions of the Roman Church. To this end they have published many spurious
Councils, many counterfeit Canons and forged Decretals; and for such as are
genuine, they have frequently altered the Text, both by Additions and
Diminutions, and have so disguised the Sense by partial and fallacious Notes,
that it will be evident (by the Remarks here made upon them) their business in
the publishing these Volumes, was not to promote the Truth, but to serve a
Party. Nor can any thing else be expected from Binius his Notes, which (as he
owns in his Preface) He took out of Baronius, Bellarmin and Possevin: The
design of which three Men (says Richerius an ingenuous Sorbon Doctor) is
evident to all Men to have been no other, but to prove the Pope was appointed
by Christ to be the absolute Monarch, and Infallible Judge of his Church
Richer. Praef. ad hist. Council. page 4.
. And since the Notes chiefly follow Baronius, we have, as we go along, in
every Period noted several of the designed Falsehoods, and of the
Contradictions, Errors and Mistakes in his Annals. Which History is so full of
Forgeries, false Quotations, and feigned Tales to set up the Credit of the
Roman Church, and its corrupt Opinions and Practices, that to discover them all
would require almost as many Volumes as his Annals make: So that we must
content our selves with some of the plainest Instances which fall into this
Matter of the Councils, and will set them in a clear Light, and show they are
as contrary to Reason, as they are to true History. Which Undertaking we hope
will be many ways useful: First, It will tend to the ease of those who intend
to read over the Tomes of the Councils, or the Annals of Baronius, and save
them much time and pains by presenting the principal Errors of those great
Volumes at one View, which they would spend a long time in searching after, if
they were to gather them up as they lie dispersed. Secondly, It may be very
useful to those who desire to be rightly informed in the Controversies between
us and the Roman Church, because it will give them a clear prospect of what
Councils and other Antiquities are Authentic, and may be allowed for Evidence
in this Dispute; wherein our Adversaries have so little regard to their own
Honor, that generally one half of their Evidence is such as they have either
forged or corrupted. Thirdly, It will be necessary (by way of Antidote) to
prepare those, who by reading Books so full of Infection, may by these
plausible Falsifications be in danger to be seduced into a great esteem of the
Opinions and Practices of the Roman Church; when they find so many seemingly
ancient Tracts and Councils brought in to justify her in all things, and see
(by this false Light) all Ecclesiastical History and Records so modelled, as to
persuade their Readers, That in the purest Christian Times, all things were
believed and done in the Catholic Church just as they are now at Rome. But when
it shall appear, that all this is a continued Series and train of Impostures,
it will render their Notions and Practices, not only suspected, but odious, as
needing such vile and base Artifices, to make them seem agreeable to true
Antiquity.

To this it may be Objected, That diverse of the Modern Writers of this Church,
and especially the most Learned, do now own diverse of these Forgeries which we
here detect to have been spurious, and therefore it seems needless to prove
that which they have already granted us. I reply, That none of them own all
these Corruptions, and diverse of their Authors cite them very confidently to
this very day, and still the things themselves stand in their most approved
Editions of Councils, and the Remarks are only in Marginal Notes. But since
they were believed in those Ages, while their Supremacy and other Novel
Doctrins were setting up, and were urged for good Proofs, till these Opinions
had taken root; it is not satisfaction enough to renounce that Evidence, of
which they now have no more need, unless they disclaim the Doctrins also to
which they first gave Credit: And till they do this, it is fit the World should
know by what False-Evidence they first gained these Points. For, if a Man
should get an Estate by Bribing his Jury and his Witnesses, it is not enough
for him to confess these Persons were Suborned, unless he restore the
Ill-gotten Lands; and till he restore them, he ought to be upbraided with his
Bribery, even after he has acknowledged it. Secondly, It may be alleged, That
Junius, River and Daille abroad; Perkins, Cook and James at home; have taken
great pains on this Subject, and that the Learned Author of the Historical
Examination of the Authority of General Councils, printed at London, 1688. has
already handled this Argument. I Answer, That the Six former are chiefly
concerned in the Tracts of particular Fathers, and make few Remarks on the
Councils: The last indeed keeps close to the Great Councils, but passes over
the Small ones; and any who compares this Discourse with that, will find the
Design, the Method and Instances so different, that this Discourse will still
be useful in its kind, as that will be also: For here, in an acurate Order, all
the Frauds of that Church are put together throughout every Century, not only
what have been observed by others, but many now first taken notice of, and not
observed before. And indeed, the Instances of these Frauds are so many, that we
have been forced to give but brief Touches upon diverse of the Particulars, and
could neither enlarge upon single Instances, nor adorn the Style; our business
being chiefly to direct the younger Students in Ecclesiastical Antiquity; and
if our Remarks be but so clear as to be understood by, and useful to them, we
have our Aim. And it is hoped this may suffice to prove, That the genuine
Records of Councils do condemn the Modern Doctrine, Worship and Discipline of
the Roman Church, and that whatever in these Editions of them seems to
countenance those things, are Forgeries and Corruptions devised on purpose to
set a false gloss upon their Modern Inventions. The Methodical Discovery
whereof may convince any unprejudiced Man, That Ours is the truly Ancient and
Catholic Religion, and Theirs a Device of later times, which cannot be rendered
any way agreeable to the Primitive Writings, without innumerable Impostures and
Falsifications.

A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE Roman Forgeries. IN THE VOLUMES OF THE COUNCILS, For
the First Three Centuries.
PART I.
CHAPTER I. Of the Forgeries in the First Century.
. 1. THE Volumes of the COUNCILS in the Edition of Labbe and Cossartius, begin
with diverse Tracts; and in Binius's Edition with several Epistles, designed to
prepossess the Reader with false Notions of the Popes supreme Power over
Councils, and his Parties high Reverence for them, as also of the Protestants
having corrupted or else rejected the greatest part of them: But this whole
Discourse will sufficiently show the notorious untruth, both of their boasting
concerning Their own side, and of their Censures concerning Ours. In the
Account of Scripture Councils, where they pretend to recite the words of
Scripture, they add* for to give color to their new Supremacy, That Peter
stood up, as the Principal and Head Lab. Tom. III. page 18. and Bin. Tom. I.
par. 1. page 1.
; And again, as the Supreme and Head Ibid. page 20. Bin. page 2.
. S. Luke in the Acts, Chap. VI. 2. says, The Twelve Apostles gave the
multitude leave to elect Seven Deacons. Binius's Notes say, They had this leave
by the favor and grant of Peter Bin. page 1. col. 2. F.
. S. Luke, Chap. XV. declares, That the Question about Circumcision was finally
determined by S. James, who also cited Scripture for his determination, ver.
16, 17. But Binius's Notes say, This matter was determined, not by Scripture,
but by the Suffrage of the Apostles, and by the Judgment of Peter Lab. page 20.
Bin. page 2. col. 1.
. The same Notes a little after tell us, That this Council committed the care
of the Circumcised Converts to Peter Lab. page 21. Bin. page 2. col. 2.
; which was a poor Preferment for that Apostle, if Christ had made him Supreme
Head, and committed to him long before the Care of the whole Catholic Church.
To these Passages of Holy Scripture the Editors have tacked a fabulous Story of
the Assumption of the Virgin Mary Lab. page 24. Bin. page 3. col. 2.
; but they do not Cite one genuine Ancient Author, to prove it: That Book which
bears the Title of Dionysius Areopagitus being invented many Ages after, as
Learned men on all sides now agree.

. 2. That Ancient Collection of Canons, which were decreed by the Apostolical
Men in diverse Synods held during the Times of Persecution, is published by
these Editors under the Title of The Canons of the Holy Apostles; and their
Notes affirm, They were made by the Authority of the Apostles Lab. page 53.
Bin. pug. 14. col. 1.
; yet they are not agreed either about their Number or Authority. They print
LXXXIV Canons; but the Notes say, only the first Fifty of them are Authentic,
but the rest may and ought also to be received, since they contain nothing (Two
of them excepted, viz. the 65th and 84th Canons, which contradict the Roman
Church) but what is approved by some Popes, Councils and Fathers Lab. and Bin.
ibid.
. Now, if (as they say) the Apostles made them, their Church has been very
negligent to lose the certain Account of their number, and it is not very
modest to pretend to try the Apostles Decrees by Popes Councils and Fathers;
yet it is plain they make no distinction between the first Fifty and the
following Thirty four, rejecting all that oppose their present Doctrine and
Practice, as may be seen in these Instances.

The Sixth Canon forbids a Bishop, Priest or Deacon ((...)) to put away, or be
divorced from his Wife on pretense of Religion: The Notes pervert the Sense of
this Canon, as if it only forbid Clergy Men to cast off the care of providing
for their Wives; and prove this Sense Lab. page 53. Bin. page 14. col 2.
by a false Title, which Dionysius Exiguus put to this Canon in his Version
many Centuries after, and by an Epistle of Pope Clement the First, which all
Men own now to be spurious, and by an Epistle of Pope Gregory, who lived in the
Year 600; as if the Sense of Dionysius and Pope Gregory, when Single life was
superstitiously pressed upon the Clergy, were good proof, that Clergy Men did
not live with their Wives many Ages before that superstitious Opinion was heard
of. It Is certain the Greek Clergy are Married and cohabit with their Wives,
according to this Apostolical Canon, and the Fifteenth Canon of the Sixth
General Council: And it is not unpleasant to observe, That these Notes cite the
Second Council of Nice, to prove there were no Canons made in the Sixth General
Council; yet that very Nicene Council often Quotes, and highly approves the 82d
Canon of the Sixth General Council, as giving some Countenance to their
Image Worship. So that their wresting this Canon Apostolical from its genuine
meaning Vid. Beveridg. Not. Council. Tom. II. page 18.
upon such slight and false Evidence, is in effect rejecting it.

The Ninth Canon orders All the Clergy and Laity who are in the Church, to
Receive the Sacrament, unless they have a just Excuse Lab. page 55. Bin. page
15. col. 1.
: But the Roman Church allows the People generally to stand by and look on; and
therefore though this be one of the Authentic Canons before said by them to be
made by the Apostles, after some shuffling to restrain it (contrary to the very
words of the Canon) only to the Clergy: The Notes say, This whole Decree was
made only by Human, not by Divine Authority, and is now abrogated by a contrary
Custom. So that if a Canon of the Apostles themselves contradict a Corrupt
practice of their Church, it must be abrogated and rejected.

The 17th Canon says, He that keeps a Concubine shall not be in any Order of
the Clergy. The Notes cite some of their Doctors, who affirm, That this Crime
does not make a Clerk irregular Lab. page 56. Bin. page 15. col. 2.
; and, that this Canon is now revoked. The Annotator himself is of Opinion, It
is only public keeping a Concubine, by reason of the Infamy which makes a
Clergy-mans Orders void: Wherefore such Sinners have now more favorable
Casuists at Rome, than the Apostles or Apostolical Men were.

The 65th Canon, though it have as good Evidence for it as any of the rest, is
rejected by the Notes Lab. page 60. Bin. page 17. col. 2.
; because it forbids Men to fast on Saturday, which is now a Fasting-day at
Rome. The Notes say, No Father mentions this Canon; but presently own, That
Ignatius, Clemens Romanus, the Canons of the Sixth General Council, Gregory
Nyssen, and Anastasius Nicaenus, (to which we add Tertullian Tertul. de jejun.
adv. Psycl. cap. 14 and 15.
,) do all speak of Saturday, as a Day on which Fasting was forbid. The Notes
confess also, That the Eastern-Church, and the Church of Milan in S. Ambrose
time, allowed not Fasting upon Saturday Aug. ad Januar. ep. 118. cap. 2. and ad
Casulan. Ep. 86.
; yet after all, they will not grant this Canon to be genuine, only because it
is very unlikely that the Church of Rome should contradict a Canon of the
Apostles, whereas we have already seen, it makes no scruple to contradict them,
if they agree not with their practice. The Notes indeed say, but without any
proof, That Rome received the Saturday Fast from Peter and Paul; yet they grant
soon after, That after the Heresy of Marcion was extinct, the Roman Church did
not only lawfully, but piously Fast on Saturday. So that this was a private
Custom of the Roman Church, in which it di^fered from all other Churches, and
they know not when it began, nor who it came from; yet for such a Customs sake
they reject an Apostolical Canon.

The 69th Canon expressly enjoins the Wednesday Fast; and the Notes say, That
many Fathers mention it as of ancient Institution; yea, these Notes affirm, It
was certainly a Fast of the Apostles instituting, being observed by the whole
Church, and not appointed by any Council, but spoken of by Authors of greatest
Antiquity Lab. page 6. Bin. page 18. col. 1.
. Well then, I hope the Roman Church (whose Customs are all said to be
Apostolical) do keep this Wednesday Fast; They tell you, No: This Wednesday
Fast in their Church is changed into the Saturday Fast: And so farewell to this
Canon also.

Lastly the 84th Canon gives us a Canon of Scripture, which does not agree with
the Trent Canon, for it rejects Ecclesiasticus from being Canonical, and
mentions not Wisdom, Tobit, Judith, nor (in Old Copies Dr. C^sens Histor Canon.
Chap. 4.
) the Book of Machabees, which the Roman Church now say are Canonical
Scripture: And this is the true reason why the Notes reject this Canon Lab.
page 61 Bin. page 18. col. 2.
: They allege indeed some other frivilous reasons, such as, the leaving out
the Revelations, and putting in Clements Constitutions: But it seems very
probable to me, that it was not the Greeks (as the Notes suggest) but that
Impostor (who gave these Canons a false Title and called them the Apostles
Canons) which for carrying on his Pious Fraud, left out the Revelations, being
not written at that time, when he would have us believe these Canons were made;
and He also put in the Constitutions, which are forged in the name of the
Apostles, who were to be set up as Authors also of these Canons: And if that
were so, this 84th Canon being cleared from those two Corruptions, is an
Ancient and very Authentic Record of the true and genuine Books of Holy
Scripture, but the Romanists reject it, as being a good evidence against their
New Trent Canon.

3. To these Canons are joined a pretended Council of the Apostles at Antioch,
first put into the Tomes of the Councils, by Binius, and continued by Labbe
Lab. page 62. Bin. page 18. col. 2.
; one Canon of which allows Christians to make an image of Christ: But this
notorius, and improbable Forgery was never heard of in any Author, till that
infamous second Nicene Council, which wanting proofs for Image Worship from
genuine Antiquity, impudently feigned such Authorities as this pretended
Council.

. 4. The Pontifical or Lives of the Popes (which begins here) bears the Title
of Pope Damasus; but the Notes say Damasus was not Author of it, being
evidently patched up out of two different Authors, containing contradictions
almost in every Popes Life. So that no account is to be made of a Writing so
different from it self Lab. page 63. Bin. page 19. col. 2.
: Now if this be (as it certainly is) a True Character of the Pontifical, Why
do these Editors print it? Why do the Notes so often cite it as good Hisstory?
Why do their Divines quote it as good Authority to prove their Modern
Corruptions to have been primitive Rites Harding against Jewel, page 53. Dr.
James corrup. of Faith, par. 1. p. 22.
? Since it is a manifest Legend, and contained at first nothing but the bare
Names and continuance of the several Popes; and was filled up by Isidore
Mercator, who forged the Decretal Epistles, with many improbable Fictions
unsuitable both to the Men and Times, for which they were invented, and
designed to be a ground for those Decretal Epistles; and to make the World
believe, that all the Popes were considerable for their Actions in all Ages, as
Dr. Peirson has excellently proved in his Learned Posthumous Dissertation
Cestriens. dissert. posthum. lib. 2. cap. 1, 2. etc.
: Yet not only these Editors of the Councils print this corrupt Legend, but
their very Breviaries and Missals generally appoint the Lessons out of it, on
the Festivals of these Ancient Popes; publishing in the very Church in time of
Divine Service, these Fictions for the true ground of the Peoples Devotions on
those Days: I confess Binius out of Baronius has Notes upon every Pope 's
Life, and rejects commonly some part of it; but then it is such passages as no
way concern the opinion or practice of the present Roman Church: For the
passages which do agree thereto (though equally false) he generally defends,
yea cites them to prove their Modern Faith and Usages: But as we come to the
several Popes Lives, which these Editors make the grand direction in
Ecclesiastical Chronology, we shall observe the many and gross Errors contained
in it; We begin with the Life of S. Peter, whom if we do allow to have been at
Rome, as this Author reports, yet we cannot believe he ordained three Bishops
for his Successors there in his Lifetime, viz. Linus, Cletus and Clement: Nor
that he was Buried in three several places, in Apollo 's Temple, and besides
Nero 's Palace in the Vatican, and besides the Triumphal Territory, which this
fabulous Writer affirms: Nor will the Annotator admit that S. Peter could be
Crucified by Nero in the 38th year after Christ 's Passion, which was three
years almost after Nero's own Death.

. 5. The next place, (ever since P. Crabs Edition) is by the Roman Editors
allotted to a Treatise of the Popes Supremacy Lab. col. 65. Bin. page 20. col.
2.
, writ of late Times by some manifest Sycophant of the Roman Church, yet placed
here among the Venerable Antiquities of the Apostolic Age, to clap a false
Biass on the unwary Reader; and make him apt to believe (that which Richerius
said is the main design of Bellarmin, Baronius and Possevine in all their
Works, viz.) that the Pope was made by Christ the infallible and absolute
Monarch of the Church Richer. praesul. ad histor. Council.
; but the Tract it self makes out this high Claim, chiefly by the Decretal
Epistles, which are now confessed to be Forgeries; And by the Sayings of Popes,
who were not to be believed in their own case John. V. 31. nemo sibi and
pros^ssor, and testis. Tert. in Marcion. lib. 5.
: To which are added some few Fragments of the Fathers falsely applied, and
certain false Arguments, which have been confuted a thousand times. So that the
placing this Treatise here, serves only to show the Editors partiality to
promote a bad Cause.

. 6. The Pontifical places Linus as S. Peter's Successor; but the Notes confess,
that the Fathers are not agreed about it Lab page 72. Bin. page 24. col. 1.
: They own that Tertullian, Epiphanius and Ruffinus make Clement to succeed
Peter; and the late Learned Bishop of Chester proves, Linus was dead before
Peter Cesiriens. diss. 2. cap. 2.
. Irenaeus does not say (as the Notes falsely cite him,) that Linus succeeded
Peter in the Government of the universal Church Iren. adv. haer l. 3. c. 3.
; but only that Peter and Paul delivered the Administration of that Church to
him, which they had founded at Rome; Which they might do in their Life time,
while they went to preach in other places: The Epistle of Ignatius to Mary
Cassibolite, and the Verses attributed to Tertullian, which they bring for
proof of this Succession, are confessed to be spurious Tracts: St. Hierom is
dubious, and upon the whole matter, there is no certainty who was Bishop of
Rome next to the Apostles, and therefore the Romanists build on an ill Bottom,
when they lay so great weight on their personal Succession.

. 7. The like Blunder there is about the next Pope: The fabulous Pontifical
makes Cletus succeed Linus, and gives us several Lives of Cletus and Anacletus,
making them of several Nations, and to have been Popes at different times,
putting Clement between them. Yet the aforesaid Learned Bishop of Chester,
proves these were only two names of the same Person Cestriens. diss. 2. cap. 1.
; But the Notes attempt to justify the forged Pontifical, by impudently
affirming Lab. page 74. Bin. page 25. col. 1.
that Ignatius, (Anacletus contemporary) Irenaeus, Eusebius, St. Augustine and
Optatus, were all mistaken, or all wronged by their Transcribers, who leave out
Cletus: But every Candid Reader will rather believe the Mistake to be in the
Pontifical (which is a mere heap of Errors) and in the Roman Martyrology and
Missal, which blindly follow it, rather than in those Eminent and Ancient
Fathers: And every one may see the Folly of the Romish Church, which Venerates
two several Saints, on two several Days, one of which never had a real Being;
for Cletus is but the abbreviation of Anacletus his Name.

. 8. After this we have the Life of Clement, wherein the Pontifical makes him
succeed Cletus, under those Consuls which were in Office the next year after S.
Peter's Martyrdom, though he had assigned 23 years to Linus and Cletus, his
pretended Predecessors Lab. page 75. Bin. page 25. col. 1.
; which years must all be expired in one years compass, if this Account be
true; and one would admire the stupidity of this Author, who though he had
placed S. Peter's Death so many years before Clement's Entrance, as to leave
room for two intermediate Popes; yet here again repeats his old Fable of S.
Peter's delivering the Bishopric of Rome to Clement; a sufficient proof there is
neither Truth nor Certainty in the pretended Personal Succession of the first
Popes.

. 9. From this Pope Clement down to the time of Syricius, who lived 300 years
after him, there are printed in these Editors, after every Popes Life, diverse
Decretal Epistles, pretended to be writ by the several Popes, and Vindicated by
Binius's. Notes annexed to them: Which were received in the Western Church for
many Hundred years together as the genuine Decrees of these ancient and pious
Popes, transcribed into the Canon Law; and cited for many Ages to justify the
Usurpations, and defend the Corruptions of the Roman Church, to determine
Causes and decide Controversies in Religion: And yet they are all notorious
Forgeries; so that since Learning was revived, diverse of the most Eminent Roman
Writers have rejected them. Card. Cusanus affirms, That being compared with the
times in which they are pretended to have been Writ, they betray themselves
Cusan. de Concord. Cath. l. 3.
. Baronius calls them, Late invented Evidences of no Credit, and Apocryphal
Baron. An. 865.. 7. and An. 102. 6, 7
; yea, Labbe and Cossartius have in their Edition a Learned Preface to them,
proving them to be forged Labbe page 78.
: And in their Margin write almost against every Epistle, This is suspected;
This is Isidores Wares, etc. and also note the very places of Authors who lived
long after these Times, out of which large Passages in them are stolen
Verbatim. Which clear Confession of our Adversaries may make some think it
needless to confute them, and unnecessary to charge this Forgery upon the Roman
Church: But I cannot think it fit wholly to pass them by; because Turrian the
Jesuit had the Confidence to defend them all as genuine; and Binius in his
Edition, not only Vindicates them by a general Preface Bin. page 26. col. 1.
, but by particular Notes labors to prove most of them Authentic; and Labbe
himself prints those Notes at large in his Edition, so that such as do not look
into his Margen, may be deceived. Besides, this Confession of some Romanists
comes too late to compensate for the injury done to the Truth, by their
Churches approving them so long: And they still keep up the Supremacy, and all
their corrupt Practices and Opinions, which were set up and cherished by these
Forgeries; they now take away the Scaffolds, when the Building can stand alone;
they execute the Traitor, but enjoy freely the benefit of his Treason.
Moreover, while some Romanists condemn them, others go on to cite them for good
Authority: Harding brags, he had proved many Points of Faith by the Epistles of
Clement Damasus, Julius Melchiades, Pontianus, Sixtus, Soter, and Symmachus
Hard. against Jewel, page 22.
: Dr. Tho. James shows the particular corrupt Doctrines and Practices, which
the late Roman Writers defend by the spurious Epistles of Clement, Marcellus,

: And the Learned Cook with infinite diligence, has cited the very Places of
the Modern Champions for the Roman Opinions, and showed what Doctrines and
Practices they do maintain by these Forged Epistles Rob. Coci Censura Patr. per
totum.
. It is also well known, that the Late Scriblers for that Religion do follow
Bellarmin and Others, in citing these Decretals for good Authority, and that
the Canon Law is in a great measure composed out of these Epistles; by which,
Causes are determined at this day in all Popish Countries: Therefore till the
Romanists raze them and the Notes in their defense, out of the Volumes of the
Councils, and expunge all the false Notions taken hence, out of their Canon
Law; yea, and leave citing them in their Disputes with us, we cannot think it
needless to show the apparent Forgery of them; but we will not enlarge so as to
disprove the Particulars, but put together here our Evidence against them all.

. 10. These Epistles, though pretended to be writ in the first four Centuries,
were never heard of in the World till near 800 years after Christ: About which
time came out a Collection of Councils under the name of Isidore Hispalensis;
but whereas he died An. 636, and this Collector mentions the XIth Council of
Toledo and the Sixth General Council, which were held near Fifty years after,
this appears not to be the Work of that Isidore, but of one Isidore Mercator,
and it was first brought into France by Riculphus B. of Mentz, in which
Collection these Decretal Epistles first appeared; but the Learned Hincmarus of
Rheims immediately discerned them to be an imposture, and Writ against them, as
Baronius confesses Baron. Annal. An. 865.. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
: But though he own the Cheat, he is not willing to grant the Roman Church had
any hand in it, yet that is as clear as the Forgery; because Hincmarus was
hated and prosecuted by the Pope, and forced at last to Recant his Censure of
these Epistles; and not long after Benedictus Levitae having Transcribed diverse
Passages out of them into his Capitulars, got them confirmed at Rome, which
could not but cherish so advantageous a Fiction that supported the Supremacy,
which they then did so hotly stickle for; and therefore though they came first
to the Birth in Spain; some conjecture they were all Hatched at Rome, whose
evil Designs and Interest they are contrived to serve: But the Age was so
Ignorant when they were Invented, that there is such infamous and convincing
Marks of Forgery upon them, as makes it very easy to prove the Cheat beyond
any possibility of doubting; and we will here put the principal of them
together under their proper Heads.

. 11. First, The Style of these Decretals shows they were not writ within the
four first Centuries, wherein (at Rome especially) they writ Latin in a much
more Elegant Style than is to be found here, where the Phrases are modern,
harsh, and sometimes barbarous, so that the Reader is often puzzled to reconcile
them either to Grammar or Sense: As for Example, Pope Victor's Second Epistle
Lab. p. 595. Bin. page 79. col. 1.
, which of old began with Enim, and was mended by Binius with Semper enim; but
still there is false Latin in it, viz. aliquos nocere fratres velle Rob. Coci
Censurae page 33.
. The like barbarous Style may be observed in the two Epistles of Pontianus
Lab. p. 622. Bin. page 90, and 91.
, and in many others: But the genuine Epistles of Cornelius, preserved in
Eusebius and S. Cyprian Ep. 3 and 5. Cornel. Lab. page 683, etc. Bin. page 111,
112, 113.
, are writ in a more polite Style; and as Labbe notes, These Epistles show how
much good Money differs from counterfeit, and how much Gold excels Counters: The
like di^ference there is between the Style of that genuine Epistle of Clement
to the Corinthians Edit. Lab. page 116.
, and those silly Forgeries put out in his Name in the very Front of these
Decretals Lab. p. 82, etc. Bin. page 27, etc.
; from whence it undeniably follows, That the Decretals were not writ in the
Ages wherein the Latin Tongue flourished, nor by those Popes whose Names they
bear. And this is further manifest by diverse Words, which were not used in the
time of these Popes, but are often put into these Epistles: Such is
Religiositas for Piety, and Universitas for the World, in the Decretals of
Dionysius Lab. p. 827. Bin. page 158.
; such is Miles for a Servant, and Senior for a Lord, in the Decrees of Pope
Pius Lab. p. 576. B^n p. 71. col. 2.
, which are Words not heard of till the time of the French Empire, in that
sense: Such is the Phrase of making Oblation to redeem men's Sins, and the Name
of the Mass in Fabian's Decrees Lab. p. 650. Bin. page 101.
. Pope Gaius his Decretal Epistle mentions Pagans, but that Name was not used
for the Gentiles till Optatus Milevitanus his time, who first used it in that
Sense, says Baronius Lab. p. 925. Bin. page 172. col. 2.
. Moreover, innumerable places in these Epistles mention Primates and
Patriarchs, Archbishops and Metropolitans, etc. which Words were not used in
the Christian Church in the time of those Popes, who are pretended to have writ
about them; As for Example, The first Epistle of Clement Lab. page 91. Bin.
page 30. col. 2.
, the second Epistle of Anacletus Lab. p. 526. Bin. page 47. col. 2.
, and many others; but no Christian Writer ever used the Word Patriarch for a
Christian Bishop till Socrates Scholasticus, who writ An. 442 Beveridg. Annot.
in Council. Nicen. Tom. II. p. 52.
. In like manner we find the Word Apocrisary in Anacletus's first Epistle Lab.
p. 511. Bin. page 42. col. 2.
, and also in the second Epistle of Zepherine Lab. p. 606. Bin. page 82. col. 2.
; yet Meursius in his Glossary cannot find any elder Authority for it than
Constantine's Donation (forged after that Emperor's time), and owns the Name
was not heard of before, Gloss. p. 43. The Name of Archdeacon also is in
Clements second Epistle Lab. page 98. Bin. page 34. col. 2.
, and in Pope Lucius's Decrees Lab. p. 727. Bin. page 131. col. 2.
; but the Office and Title did not come into the Church till many years after:
And finally, the Name of a Diocesan for a Christian Bishop, is put into
Calixtus second Epistle Lab. p 612. Bin. page 85. col. 1.
, but was not used in that Sense till long after his time. All which prove
these Epistles were writ in the later barbarous Ages, and not in the time of
those Popes, whose Names they bear.

. 12. The same may be proved Secondly, by the Matter of these Epistles, which
is no way suitable to those grave and Pious Popes, who lived in times when the
Church was pestered with Heresies, and oppressed with Persecutions; yet these
Epistles do not either confute those Heresies, nor comfort the Christians under
Persecutions; But speak great Words of the Roman Supremacy, and of Appeals, of
the exemption and privileges of Bishops and Clergy Men, of splendid Altars and
rich Vessels for Divine Administrations, and the like, which make it incredible
they could be writ in an Age of suffering: Instances of this we have in
Clements first Epistle Lab. p. 91. Bin. page 30.
; where he Orders Primates and Patriarchs, to be placed in such Cities as the
Heathens, of Old had Arch-Flamins in: Whereas the Heathens then had Flamines
and Priests in all Cities: His third Epistle Lab. p. 103. Bin. page 36. col. 1.
is directed to all Princes greater and less, and Commands them to obey their
Bishops: Whereas all Princes in the World at that time were Gentiles: The like
absurdity appears in Calixtus first Epistle, where he gives Laws to the
Emperors and all others professing piety Lab. p. 609. Bin. page 83. col. 2.
, as if Heliogabulus and Caracalla had been under his Command: And in the
second Epistle of Sixtus, Ano. 260, who threatens to Excommunicate the Princes
of Spain, who spoiled their Bishops Lab. p. 822. Bin. page 157. col. 1.
, though all Princes then were Heathens: Marcellinus also in a time of
Persecution, under a Heathen Emperor gives direction what is to be done by an
Emperor professing the true Faith Lab. p. 934. Bin. page 176. col. 2.
; Who can imagine, Anacletus Anno Dom. 104, should speak of Priests in little
Villages, and of Cities which anciently had Primates and Patriarchs, or tell us
in Trajans time, That Rome had cast away her Heathen Rites Lab. p. 528. Bin.
page 49.
? Or that he should affirm the Christian people were generally Enemies to their
Priests; and Command the Bishops to visit the Thresholds of S. Peter's Church
(before it was Built Decreta ejus Lab. page 532. Bin. page 51. col. 2.
?) Is it likely Euaristus the next Pope, should declare, That Children could
not Inherit their Parents Estates, if they were not Baptized by a Christian
Priest Lab. p. 533. Bin. page 52. col. 1.
; or suppose Churches and Altars consecrated long before the Memory of any Man
in the Parish Lab. p. 541. Bin. page 54. col. 1.
? Could Pope Xystus in Adrian's Persecution brag, that Rome was the Head over
all Bishops, and also a Refuge to such as were spoiled by Christian People Lab.
p. 558. Bin. page 62. col. 2.
? Were there in Pope Hyginus time, (as his Decrees pretend) More Churches and
larger than the Revenue belonging to them could repair Lab. p. 568. Bin. page
67. col. 2.
? Is it propable Pope Pius should complain Anno 158, That Christians should
Sacrilegiously take away whole Farms dedicated to Pious Uses? Yet this
complaint is found in his second Epistle Lab. p. 574. Bin. page 70. col. 2.
; And Binius Notes justify this by a forged Decretal of Urban the First, and by
proving that in the time of Constantine (140 Years after) the Heathens had
taken Houses from the Christians: The Decree for Vailing Nuns at 25 years of
Age must be of later time, because it is certain no Nuns were veiled then, nor
were any under Sixty years Old allowed to profess Virginity Cestriens. diss. 2.
cap. 6.. 16. etc.
: When all Christians were so constantly present at Divine Offices, and
received the Sacrament Weekly; what need was there for Pope Soter to decree, No
Priest should say Mass unless two were present, and that all should Communicate
on Maunday-Thursday Lab. p. 587. Bin. page 75. col. 1.
? How could there be Secular Laws forbidding the People to conspire against
their Bishop, as Calixtus Decretal pretends Lab. p. 612. Bin. page 85. col. 1.
? or how could he mention the Laws of the Roman and Greek Emperors, so long
before the Empire was divided Ibid.
? Had Bishops in Pope Urbans time power to Banish and Imprison the
Sacrilegious? or had they high Seats in the form of a Throne, Erected for them
in Churches, as his Epistle pretends Lab. p. 618. Bin. page 87. col. 2.
? Could the next Pope by his Decree hinder Heathens and Enemies to the
Christian Clergy from accusing them? as the first Epistle of Pontianus gives
out Lab. p. 623. Bin. page, 90. col. 1.
. Antherus Epistle charges Bishops in those times with changing their Churches
out of ambition and covetousness Lab. p. 634. Bin. page 94. col. 2.
, even while nothing but Martyrdom was to be got by being a Bishop: And Fabian
is made to charge the Faithful, with spoiling their Bishops, and citing them
before the Lay-Tribunals Lab. p. 636. Bin. page 95. col. 2.
; which is not credible of the Christians of that Age: Cornelius his genuine
Epistle says; The Christians durst not meet at Prayers in any known Rooms, no
not in Cellars under ground Lab. p. 682. Bin. page 113. col. 1.
. But the Pontifical and one of his Forged Decretals, pretend that this same
Pope had liberty to Bury the Apostle S. Peter's Body in Apollo's Temple, the
Vatican and the golden Mount, that is, in three places (I suppose) at once Lab.
p. 668. Bin. page 109. col. 2.
: Lucius a Martyred Pope makes it a wonder, that in his days Churches should be
spoiled of their Oblations and Ministers vexed Lab. p. 721. Bin. page 129. col.
1.
; Pope Stephen threatens to make Slaves of Clerks, who accuse their Bishop, and
forbids Laymen to complain of the Clergy Lab. p. 732. Bin. page 134. col. 1.
, Does it consist with the poverty of those Ages, for Eutychianus to decree
That Martyrs should be Buried in Purple Lab. p. 913. Bin. page 167. col. 2.
? or with its charity, for the same Pope to forbid Christians to pray for
Heretics Lab. p. 921. Bin. page 171. col. 1.
; when our Lord bids them pray for their Enemies? I should tire the Reader and
my self, if I proceeded to Rake together any more Instances; and these may
suffice to show, That these Epistles were not writ in those early Ages.

. 13. Thirdly, The same may be proved from the many Absurdities found in these
Decretals, arguing the Author to be Illiterate and Ignorant; Whereas the Popes,
whose Names they falsely bear, were prudent and Learned Men; however well
skilled in Holy Scripture: Yet Anacletus is made to say, that the Apostles
chose the LXX Disciples Lab. p. 527. Bin. page 48. col. 2.
, which the Gospel affirms were chosen by Christ himself: He also weakly
derives Cephas (the Syriac Name of Peter, signifying a Stone) from the Greek
word (...), and says it signifies a Head, and proves Peter's Supremacy by this
silly mistake Lab. p. 529. Bin. page 49. col. 2. Vid. Causab. in Baron. page 98.
: It looks very ridiculously in Pope Antherus in his Epistle to say, it is not
fit for one in my Mean condition to judge others, nor to say any thing of the
Ministers of the Churches Lab. p. 630. Bin. page 92. col. 2.
; but indeed the Forger stole these Words out of S. Hieroms first Epistle to
Heliodorus, and foolishly applied them to the Pope: The Decretal of Stephen
tells the Gallican Church, what the Holy Apostolic and Universal Church had
undertaken to observe, as if they had been no part of the Universal Church Lab.
p. 729. Bin. page 132. col. 2.
: But nothing is more Ridiculous than the foolish Expositions of Scripture,
which Popes ought to interpret Infallibly; but these Epistles make Pope
Alexander prove, that Holy Water does sanctify, by Heb. ix. 13, 14. where the
Ashes of an Heifer are said to Purify the unclean, and the Blood of Christ to
purge the Conscience: And he interprets Hos. iv. 8. where the Priests are said
to eat up the Sins of the People, of blotting out their Sins by their Prayers
Epist. Alex. 1. Bin. page 57, and Ep. 2. Bin. p. 59.
; Pope Pius proves Bishops are only to be judged by God, because ( John II.)
Christ drove the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple with his own hands Lab.
p. 571. Bin. page 68. col. 2.
. Pope Anicetus proves, Priests ought to shave their Crowns, because S. Paul
says, It is a shame for Men to have long hair, 1 Cor. XI. Lab. p. 581. Bin.
page 72. col. 2.
; which the Apostle speaks of Laymen as well as Clergymen, and so the same
Logic would prove, that Laymen also should shave their Crowns. Pope Soter
proves, that Nuns must not touch the Holy Vessels, by S. Paul's saying, 2 Cor.
XI. He had espoused the Corinthians (both Men and Women) to one Husband, even
Christ Lab. p. 584. Bin. page 75. col. 1.
. Pope Stephen proves, That Bishops ought not to be disturbed, by that place in
the Psalms, The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament shows his
handy work Lab. p. 732. Bin page 134. col. 1.
; And to name no More, Pope Foelix is very happy in that he can make out, That
we ought not to persecute and disturb Our Brethren, from Romans V. 1, 2. When we
were Enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: And from Math.
X. Fear not them which can kill the body, etc. he proves, We must not persecute
nor disturb Preachers and Doctors, because their Souls do not dye with their
Bodies Lab. p. 906. Bin. page 164. col. 2.
. All these impertinent Inferences from Holy Scripture, show the Forger of
these Epistles was some ignorant and impudent Impostor; but none can suppose
those holy Primitive Bishops would abuse Scripture and themselves at this rate.

. 14. Fourthly, this further appears, From many Quotations in these Epistles,
which are taken verbatim out of Authors, that lived and writ long after all
these Popes were dead, in whose Names these Epistles are forged; wherefore they
could not write them. Now this infallible Mark of their Forgery appears first,
in that these Epistles do all generally cite Scripture, according to S. Hieroms
Translation De Marca makes this an infallible Note, that these Epistles are
forged. De Concord. lib. 3. cap. 5.
, which was not made in their days; yet Clement in his 4th and 5th Epistles,
Euaristus in both his Epistles, Telesphorus in his Decretal, and indeed all the
rest of them who have occasion to quote Scripture, do use the very Words of S.
Hierom, and that sometimes for a whole Page together, as the Reader will find
by comparing these Quotations with the Vulgar Latin Bible. But Learned Men know
that the Latin Fathers, who lived before S. Hierom's Translation was extant,
used another Version very different from that, and even Pope Cornelius in that
genuine Epistle of his, which is preserved in S. Cyprian, does not follow S.
Hierom's Translation Lab. p. 683. Bin. page 113. col. 2.
; but his Forged ones do: Which is a Proof undeniable, That he who Forged these
Epistles, lived after S. Hierom's Translation was grown common. Besides;
Anacletus is made to cite a long Passage verbatim out of S. Hierom's Epistle to
Nep^tian, which was writ almost 300 years after his time Ep. 3. Anacleti, Lab.
529. Bin. 49.
. Pope Eleutherius cites a Law out of the Theodosian Code, Judicantem cuncta
rimari oportet, etc. Lab. p. 588. Bin. page 76. col. 1.
, which was made 300 years after this Popes death, and this convinced Contius
and Baronius, that this Epistle was Forged after Theodosius his Reign; yet
Binius has the Impudence to say, Perhaps the Code borrowed this Passage from
the Epistle; but Labbe is so ashamed of this bold Falsehood, that in his Margen
he writes, Binius in this is mistaken; and he had reason for that Note, since
this is not the only place in the feigned Decretals where the Code is cited.
Labbe owns that the second forged Epistle for Pope Eutychianus quotes a Law
verbatim out of Cod. Theod. lib. 9. Tit. 1, and 2. Lab. p. 917. Bin. page 169.
col. 2.
. Pope Zepherine also cites Imperial Laws and Edicts, Forbidding Men to cite a
Bishop despoiled of his goods, into any Secular Judicature, till all were
restored Lab. p. 606. Bin. page 82. col. 2.
; the same Passage also is cited out of the Secular Laws in Pope Stephen's
second Epistle Lab. p. 732. Bin. page 134. col. 1.
. But it is most certain there could be no such Laws in these Popes times who
lived under Pagan Emperors; nor a Law to forbid the People to conspire against
their Bishops, which yet Calixtus cites in his second Epistle Lab. p. ^12. Bin.
page 85. col. 1.
. Moreover, Antherus cites a long Passage, word for word, out of S. Hierom's
Epistle to Heliodorus Lab. p. 630. Bin. page 92. col. 2.
; Pope Lucius is made to use (as Labbe confesses) the Words of his Successor
Agatho, in the Sixth Council of Constantinople, 300 years after Lab. p. 721.
Bin. page 129. col. 1.
: And yet Bellarmin cites this place of the Forged Epistle twice, to prove the
Pope's Infallibility, Bell. de Romans Pontif. l. 4. c. 3. and de Verb. Dei, lib.
3. cap. 5. Pope Sixtus the Second, His first Epistle is stolen most of it out
of Ithacius and Varimadus, who lived many Ages after him Lab. p. 820. Bin. page
156.
. In Eutychianus's first Epistle, there are two whole Pages transcribed out of
his Successor, Pope Leo's 97th Epistle Lab. p. 914. Bin. page 168. col. 1.
: And Gaius his Decretal Epistle, steals two large Passages from the same Pope
Leo's twelfth Sermon on the Passion, and his 97th Epistle Lab. p. 925. Bin.
page 172. col. 2.
. Finally, whosoever will take pains to observe Labbe's Margen shall find, that
he with great diligence has marked in the Margen of all these Forged Epistles;
the very places of later Authors out of which they are sto^len, and transcribed
by their cheating Composer, who patcht them up together out of the Writings of
S. Hilary, S. Hierom, Pope Leo, Innocent, Gelasius, and Gregory, etc. who lived
many years after all these Popes were dead, which is an Unanswerable Proof,
that they could not be writ by those whose Names they bear.

15. Fifthly, Those Popes could not but know their own Times; and if they had
writ them, they could not have been mistaken in Chronology, or in the Date of
their Epistles; but the Forger of them had so little skill in the Times for
which he invented them, that he is almost every where erroneous in his
Computation. The two first Epistles of Clement are written to S. James after S.
Peter's death; yet it is confessed by Binius, S James dyed six or seven years
before S. Peter. Binius would solve this by saying, The Name of James crept
into the Title instead of Simeon; but alas! the Name of James is repeated
often in the very Body of the Epistles, and that proves them Forged Lab. p. 82.
and page 98. Bin. page 27, and page 34.
. The Names of the Consuls also by which most of these Epistles are Dated, must
have been right if they had been writ by these old Bishops of Rome, who could
not be ignorant of the true Consuls in their own time; but alas! they are so
generally false, that Binius in his Notes, in vain labors to excuse some few
of them, and is forced to own the rest to be false; so that Surius was more
cunning to leave all the Consuls Names out of his Edition, Because (he says)
Calvin takes occasion from thence to despise all the Epistles Praefat. Laur.
Surii ap. Lab. Tom. l. page 13.
; and doubtless the Dates are as true as the Epistles, both having sufficient
Marks upon them of a Modern Impostor, unskilled in those Times. And it is
evident, that the Pontifical names the same false Consuls, so that either one
Author forged the Popes Lives and their Epistles, or the Inventer of these
Epistles took the Consuls Names so constantly from the Pontifical, that he
imitates him in false-spelling the Consuls names, and in joining Men who were
never Consuls together; yea, because that Fabulous Pontifical usually Names no
Consuls, but those in Office at Every Popes Entrance and Death, This Forger of
the Epistles dates them all either by the first or last Consuls of every Pope,
as if all the Popes had only written Epistles in their first and last years: A
Few Examples of these Errors shall suffice.

The Pontifical makes Pope Euaristus to enter when Valens and Vetus were
Consuls, and to be martyred when Gallus and Bradua were Consuls, and so the
Forger dates his first Epistle by the names of his first Consuls, and the
second Epistle by the Consuls of his last year: But alas! both the Pontifical
and Epistles are woefully mistaken, since Euaristus (as Baronius proves) entered
the 13th year of Trajan, that is, fourteen years after the Consulship of Valens
and Vetus, and two years after the Consulship of Gallus and Bradua; so that by
this Account he writ Decretal Epistles long before he was Pope Lab. p. 532.
Bin. page 51. col. 2.
: So also, whereas Pope Alexander really sat in Adrian the Emperors time, and
Trajan was dead before his entrance, yet one of his Epistles is dated with
Trajan as one Consul, and Helianus as the other; but these two were never
Consuls together Lab. p. 542. Bin. page 55. col. 2.
: And his second Epistle is dated by the Consuls of Adrian's first year,
whereas Pope Alexander came but into his See in Adrian's third year. I will not
trouble my self with any more Instances, because there are none of these Dates
true, and many of them with the Pontifical (which guides the Forgery) so grossly
false, as to make Popes write Epistles before they were chosen, and after they
were dead Exemp^i gratia, Telesphori Ep. 1. Aniceti Ep. 1. Zepherin. 1 and 2.
Pontiani Ep. 2. Fabiani Ep. 3. Cornelii Ep. 1, 2. and in multis aliis.
; which is an undeniable Evidence, that the Inventer of these Epistles was a
Modern Cheat, ignorant of the true Times both of the Consuls and the Popes.
There are other Errors also besides the Dates, which show, the Bungling Author
of these Epistles neither understood Chronology nor History. The Pontifical,
before it was corrected, had made Anicetus Pope, Pius his Predecessor; and
therefore Pius his third Epistle does not reckon him among the Priests at Rome,
but puts in Eleutherius as one of Pius his Presbyters Lab. p. 576. Bin. page
70. col. 2.
, who was but a Deacon in the time of his Successor Anicetus Eusebius. hist. lib.
4. cap. 22. and Brev. Romans Maii 26.
. The same Epistle makes Cerinthus the Heretic to be alive, and busy at Rome
in seducing Men, An. 166; yet Binius before tells us he was present in the
Synod at Jerusalem An. Christi 51, at which Synod, if he were but Nineteen
years of Age, he must in Pius his time have been 130, which is incredible; but
Binius says, this may be believed, because the first Epistle of Pius mentions
Hermes ( named by S. Paul, Romans XVI.) who set forth a Book about this time An.
158; which Hermes, if he were but only 34 year old An. Christi 62, when S. Paul
writ his Epistle to the Romans, must be 130 years of Age, when he set forth
this Book; but in conclusion, the Story of Hermes and his Apocryphal Book is a
mere Fable, stolen out of the Pontifical Lab. p. 572. Bin. page 68. col. 2.
, and Binius has no way to defend one of these Fictions, but with another
equally absurd. Again, Pope Victor is made to summon one Theophilus (Bishop of
Alexandria) to a Council at Rome; but there was no Theophilus Bishop therein
Victor's time, Severus was then Bishop of that See, and this Theophilus was
Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine Lab. p. 593. Bin. page 78. col. 1. Eusebius. lib.
5. cap. 22.
; but if Victor had really writ this Epistle, he could not have made so gross a
Mistake: In like manner Antherus Epistle mentions one Eusebius, as then Bishop
of Alexandria Lab. p. 630. Bin. page 92. col. 2.
, who was not Bishop there till two or three Ages after Dodwel. ap. Cestr.
diss. 2. cap. 6.
. The first Epistle of Pope Fabian, dated in his first year, mentions Novatus
the Heretic coming out of Africa to Rome, and seducing Novatian, with others
Lab. p. 636. Bin. page 92. col. 2.
; but Baronius out of Eusebius and S. Cyprian assures us, that Novatus came not
to Rome till Fifteen years after Baron. An. 238.. 9.
. Wherefore these Epistles were devised by a later Author, who knew neither the
History nor Chronology of those Ages for which he invented these Epistles; but
had only the Fabulous Pontifical in his eye, and follows it in all its Errors
and Absurdities: So that since the Pontifical makes Pope Hyginus an Athenian,
Pope Pius an Italian, and Pope Soter born in Campania; Isidore forges three
Epistles for Hyginus, To the Athenians; for Pius, To his Italian Brethren;
(...) S^ter, To all the Campanians: And when the Pontifica^ falsely devises
several Superstitious Rites, begun in the corrupt Ages, and other Usages, to
have been first appointed by some of the Ancient Popes, the said I idore upon
that always forges an Epistle in those Popes Names to enjoin those Rites; and
hence Pope Alexander writes an Epistle about Holy Water Epist. 1. Alexander.
; Sixtus, about none but the Clergies touching Consecrated Vessels Sixti Ep. 2.
; Telesphorus, about keeping Lent Seven Weeks T^lesph^r. Ep 1.
; Pius, about keeping Easter upon Sunday Pii Ep. 1.
; Anicetus, about Shaving Priests Crowns Aniceti Epist. 1.
; Calixtus, about four Ember Weeks Calixti Epist. 1.
; and so did other Popes, whereas most of these Rites were settled long after,
and only prove these Epistles were forged by Isidore.

. 16. Now though it he so apparent and undeniable, that these Epistles are
Forged, and consequently of no Authority; yet the Roman Church has made great
use of them in the Ignorant Ages: For Binius notes all along in his Margen,
what Sections of them are transcribed into their Canon Law; and even in later
times their Writers against the Protestants do commonly cite their Infamous
Impostures, to prove the Supremacy of the Pope, his Infallibility, and right to
Appeals; as also for the exemption of the Clergy, their Celibacy and Habits,
and to prove their Mass with its Ceremonies, Auricular Confession, Apocryphal
Books, Tradition, Chrism, Veneration of Relics and Martyrs, etc. and Cook in
his Censura Patrum, has noted the several Epistles, and the Authors which cite
them, saving us the labor of instancing: And therefore we will only make a few
general Observations upon this matter, and so dismiss these Forgeries.

Observe. I. That since the Romanists have no other genuine Ancient Authors, to
prove these New-Doctrines and Practices by; but are forced generally to place
these apparent Forgeries in the Forefront of all their Authorities, we may
conclude these Points of their Religion are all Innovations, unheard of in the
Primitive Ages; so that Isidore was forced to invent these Epistles almost 800
years after Christ, to give some show of Antiquity to them; and these Points
were in those Ignorant-Times mistaken by this means for Primitive Usages and
Opinions, and so got footing in the World under that disguise; but now that the
Fallacy is discovered, the Doctrines and Practices ought to be disowned as
well, as the Epistles on which they are built.

Observe II. There are many other Points of the Roman Religion, which are not so
much as mentioned in any of these Forged Epistles, such as Worship of Images,
Formal Praying to the Saints, and to the Virgin Mary; Transubstantiation,
Half-Communion, and Adoration of the Host, Purgatory, Indulgences, and
Justification by Merits, with some others. Now these are so New, that in
Isidore's time, when he invented these Epistles they were not heard of nor
received, no not in the Roman Church; for if they had, no doubt this Impostor,
who was so zealous to get Credit for all the Opinions and Usages of that Church
which he knew of, would have made some Popes write Epistles to justify these
also, and his silence concerning them makes it more than probable, that these
were all invented since the year of Christ 800.

Observe. III. Though the later Romanists frequently cite these Forged
Decretals, yet no genuine Author or Historian for Seven hundred years after
Christ did ever Quote or Mention them, no not so much as any of the Popes
themselves in all that Period. Now it is morally impossible so many important
Points should be so clearly decided by so many Ancient Bishops of so Famous a
Church, and yet no Author ever take notice of it. And doubtless when the Popes
attempted to be Supreme, and claimed Appeals about the year 400, Zosimus and
Boniface, who quarrelled with the Eastern and African Bishops about these
Points, and were so hard put to it for Evidence, as to feign some private
Canons were made at the first general Council of Nice, would certainly have
cited these Epistles, which are so clear Evidence for their pretenses, if they
had either seen or heard of them; but they do not once name them in all that
Controversy, which shows they were not then in being; yea, those who know
Church History, do clearly discern, that the main Points settled by these
Epistles, were things disputed of about the Seventh and Eighth Centuries, a
little before Isidore's time; and therefore these Forgeries must never be cited
for to prove any Point to be Ancient or Primitive.

. 17. Obs. IV. Though the Inventer of these Epistles was so zealous a Bigot for
the Roman Cause, yet many things are to be found in them, which contradict the
present Tenants of that Church. For whereas the Pope now claims an Universal
Supremacy even over Jerusalem it self; Clement's first Epistle is directed to
James the Bishop of Bishop's, Ruling the Hebrew Church at Jerusalem, and all
the Churches every where founded by Divine providence Lab. page 82. Bin. page
27.
. Anacletus first Epistle orders all the Clergy present to receive, under pain
of Excommunication Lab. p. 511. Bin. page 42. col. 1.
; which is not observed now in the Roman Church: Pope Telesphorus orders a Mass
on the Night before Christmas, and forbids any to begin Mass, before nine a
Clock Lab. p. 562. Bin. page 64. col. 2.
; But Binius confesses their Church does not now observe either of these
Orders: Pope Hyginus forbids all foreign Jurisdiction, because it is unfit,
they should be Judged abroad, who have Judges at home Lab. p. 567. Bin. page
66. col. 2.
; So the third Epistle of Pope Fabian, appoints that every Cause shall be tried
where the Crime is committed; which passage is also in a genuine Epistle of S.
Cyprian to Cornelius Lab. p. 698. Bin. page 119. col. 2.
. And all foreign Jurisdiction is again forbid in Pope Felix his second Epistle
Lab. p. 906. Bin. page 164. col. 2.
, which passages do utterly destroy Appeals to Rome, unless they can prove all
the Crimes in the World are committed there: The second Epistle of Fabian
allows the People to reprove their Bishop if he Err in matters of Faith Lab. p.
640. Bin. page 97. col. 1.
; the same Liberty also is given to the People, in Cornelius second Epistle
Lab. p. 671. Bin. page 110. col. 2.
; which seems to make the People Judges in Matter of Faith, a thing which the
Modern Romanists charge upon the Protestants as a great Error: From these and
many other passages we may see, that these Impostures do not in all Points
agree with the present Roman Church.

. 18. I have now done with the Epistles themselves, and proved them to be
apparent Forgeries; I will only give the Reader some cautions about those
partial Notes, printed on them both in Binius and Labbe, which though they
frequently correct, confute and alter diverse passages in these Epistles; Yet if
any thing look kindly upon the Roman Church, they magnify and vindicate it;
but if it seem to condemn any of their Usages, they reject and slight it: For
Example, Pope Pius cites Coloss. XI. 18. against worshipping Angels, and the
Notes, reject both S. Hierom's and Theodoret's Exposition of the place, as
Reflecting on their Churches practice, adding that S. Paul condemned Cerinthus
in that place, for giving too much Honor to Angels; Yet Binius soon after
tells us that Cerinthus was so far from Teaching they were to be Adored, that
he thought they were to be Hated as Authors of Evil Not Bin. in 1. Ep. Pii.
Lab. page 571. Bin. page 68.
. Pope Zepherine cites the Apostolical Canons for the Privileges of his See,
and says there were but Seventy of them Lab. p. 605. Bin. page 81. col. 2.
: But Binius in his Notes says he refers to the Seventy third Canon: Yet if
the Reader consult that Seventy third Canon, the Pope's See is not named there;
yea, that Canon forbids a Bishop to Appeal from his Neighbor Bishop, unless it
be to a Council: Out of Calixtus first Epistle which Labbe owns to be a
manifest Forgery; Binius Notes cite a Testimoy for the Supremacy, calling it an
evident Testimony and worthy to be Noted Lab. p. 609. Bin. page 83. col. 2.
; Pontianus in his Exile brags, ridiculously about the Dignity of Priests, in
his second Epistle Lab. p. 624. Bin. page 90. col. 1.
. And Binius his Notes vindicate this improbable Forgery by a spurious Epistle
attributed to Ignatius, which says -- the Laity must be subject to the
Deacons: but Binius cites it thus -- The Laity, of which number are all Kings,
even the most Christian Kings, must be subject to the Deacons; by which
falsifying the Quotation, he makes the meanest Deacon in the Roman Church
superior to the French King: Again, in the Vacancy after Fabian, the Clergy of
Rome and S. Cyprian writ to each other Lab. p. 654. Bin. page 103. col. 1.
: Where though the Roman Clergy write with all respect to the Clergy of
Carthage, and give them humble Advice, not Commands; yea, and thank S. Cyprian
for his humility, in acquainting them with his Affairs, not as Judges of his
concerns, but Partners in his Counsels. Binius notes that these Letters do
sufficiently show the Prerogative of the Roman Church -- and that S. Cyprian
not only desired the Counsel, but submitted to the Judgment of Rome. The first
Epistle of Cornelius tells a false story out of the Pontifical about his
removing the Bodies of S. Peter and Paul; and though Binius own this part of
the Epistle to be Forged; Yet in his Notes on the Pontifical Lab. p. 667. Bin.
page 108. col. 1.
, he strives to reconcile the differing ways of relating this Fabulous
Translation, and flies to Miracles to make those Lies hang together. Cornelius
third Epistle is genuine, being preserved in Greek by Eusebius, and yet Binius
prints a corrupt Latin Version with it, which where the Greek speaks of one
Bishop in a Catholic Church -- Reads it -- in this Catholic Church; and the
Notes Bin. p. 112. col. 2.
impudently prove by this Corruption, that the Pope is the sole Bishop of the
whole Catholic Church: Of which Labbe was so much ashamed, that he prints
Valesius's Latin Version of this Epistle, wherein the ground of Binius his
Observation is quite taken away. S. Cyprian has several Epistles printed among
the Decretals, wherein are many things which overthrow the Roman Supremacy and
Infallibility, upon which no remark is placed, but an obscure passage wherein
S. Cyprian says, that whether he or Cornelius should be the Survivor, must
continue his Payers for the afflicted Christians Lab. p. 703. Bin. page 120.
. There it is impertiently noted, That the deceased pray for the living: Pope
Stephen's second Epistle asserts, Primates were in use before Christianity Lab.
p. 732. Bin. page 134. col. 1.
. Binius in his Notes out of Baronius, says Heredotus confesses the same
thing; but Labbe declares that some body had imposed upon Baronius, for there
is no such thing to be found in Herodotus; and Adrian in Vopiscus (his other
Authority) evidently speaks of the Christian Bishop of Alexandria Scriptor.
Histor. August. page 960.
: Wherefore Pope Stephen, or he that made the Epistle for him, was mistaken: It
is an impudent thing also in Binius to note upon one of S. Cyprian's Letters
about Basilides and Martialis, You see the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome: For
these two Bishops were justly condemned in Spain, and unjustly absolved by the
Pope, after which S. Cyprian condemns them again, only certifying the Bishop of
Rome that he had justly nulled his Absolution; so that we may rather note, You
see the Primacy of the Bishop of Carthage Bin. p. 136. col. 1.
. Pope Eutychianus first Epistle following the Erroneous Pontifical Lab. p.
914. Bin. page 168. col. 1.
, Orders that only Beans and Grapes shall be offered on the Altar: Binius says
this is the Fourth Canon of the Apostles, whereas that fourth Canon does not
name Beans, and the Third Canon forbids all kind of Pulse to be offered on the
Altar; so that the Impostor was deceived, and Binius becomes Ridiculous by
attempting to defend him: I shall not need produce any more instances, these
will suffice to warn those who study the Councils, not to rely upon any thing
in these Notes, which are so full of partiality and Errors, of weak reasonings
and false Quotations, of ignorant and wilful Mistakes, that there is little
heed to be given to them.

. 19. I doubt I have been too tedious in discovering the Forgeries of these
Decretal Epistles; but the Reader must consider they take up the greatest part
of this first Period in the Volumes of the Councils, and we have here
considered them all together: And now we have nothing to observe in this
Century, except the Apostolical Constitutions, which are left out in Binius,
but printed in Labbe, in Greek and Latin, next after Clement's genuine Epistle
to the Corinthians: Now the Constitutions are a very ancient Forgery, compiled
about the end of the Fourth, and beginning of the Fifth Century, of the Rites
of which Ages they give a very good account, and have little or nothing in
them, to justify the more Modern Corruptions of Rome; for which cause it is
likely Binius omitted them: But if we know beforehand that the Apostles did
not make them, nor Clement Bishop of Rome collect them, and can pardon the
boldness of making the Apostles the speakers, they are useful to be read, as a
writing composed in the Fourth or Fifth Age.

CHAP. II. Of the Forgeries in the Second Century.
. 1. THis Period begins with the Life of Anacletus, who was made Pope, as they
say, An. 104. but the Fabulous Pontifical brings him in, the 10th Confulship of
Domitian, that is, just upon the fictitious Cletus his death, and before
Clement entered, who yet is there said to be his Predecessor; so blundered and
uncertain is that ignorant Writer; yet, except what he says, no other Author
mentions any deeds of Anacletus; and though Binius in his Notes affirm,
Anacletus was most famous for many eminent deeds (s), Lab. p. 511. Bin. page
42. col. 1.
yet he cannot name one of them.

Euaristus his Life follows, whom the Pontifical and the Breviary of Sixtus the
Fifth Lab. p. 532. Bin. page 5 1. col. 2.
, make to have been Pope in the time of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan; but Binius
out of Baronius takes upon him to correct both the Pontifical and the Roman
Office also, assuring us he began in the 13th year of Trajan; but alas! these
first Bishops of Rome were so obscure, that nothing but their Name is upon
Record in Authentic Authors. And what is said in the ^ontifical, and the Notes,
concerning their several Parents, Countries, times of sitting in that See, and
all their Actions almost, are mere Impostures of later Ages, as the Learned Dr.
Pierson proves in his afore-cited Posthumous Dissertation.

Alexander's Life is next, wherein Binius again corrects the Pontifical and the
Breviary; which say, He Ruled the Church in the days of Trajan Lab. p. 541.
Bin. page 55. col. 1. Brev. Sixth. 5. in Maii 3.
; affirming, he entered not On the Papacy till Adrian's time: But there was more
need to Correct the Breviary of his Infallible Church, for those fabulous
Lessons it orders to be read in the Church on this Popes day, about Alexander's
converting Hermes a Prefect of Rome, Quirinus a Tribune and Balbina his
Daughter, who also is Sainted; yet after all, there were no such persons in
those Offices in Rome at that time Cestriens. dissert. posthum. diss. 2. cap.
7. page 227.
; and the whole Story is a Fiction taken out of a fabulous Tract called the
Acts of Alexander, yet this Legend Binius's Notes defend.

Of Xystus, the next Pope, nothing is memorable, but that he is said by the
Pontifical to be a Martyr. Eusebius says, he died in Adrian's Twelfth year,
and mentions not his Martyrdom Eusebius. lib. 4. c. 5.
; but Binius contradicts him, and will have him to suffer in the 3d year of
Antomnus Lab. p. 554. Bin page 60. col. ^.
; and this without any Authority for it, but his own.

Telesphorus, according to Eusebius, was the Seventh Pope from St. Peter, and
came in the Twelfth year of Adrian Eusebius. ut supr.
, that is, An. 130. But Binius following the Pontifical, makes him the Eighth
Pope, and says he entered the Third year of Antoninus, that is, Twelve years
after; and in the Notes on his Life Lab. p. 559. Bin. page 63. col. 2.
, upon the Pontificals saying, he Ordained Thirteen Bishops in his Eleven
years, he observes, that these Bishops were to be sent into diverse parts of the
World; from whence (he says) it is clear that the Pope was to take care not of
Rome only, but the whole World. But first, no inference from so fabulous an
Author, as the Pontifical, can be clear: And secondly, if there were so many
Bishops really Ordained by Popes, as the Pontifical does pretend, there are but
Sixty three Bishops reckoned by him from S. Peter's death to this time, which
is near 100 years. From whence (if we grant the Matter of Fact) it is rather
clear, That the Pope Ordained only some Italian Bishops near Rome; for
otherwise when so many Bishops were Martyred, there must have been far more
Ordained for the World in that space of time.

Hyginus, the next Pope, began (says Eusebius) in the first year of Antoninus;
but Binius says, he was made Pope the Fifteenth of that Emperor; the Reader
will guess whether is to be trusted: The Pontifical could find this Pope
nothing to do, but to distribute the Orders of the Clergy, which Pope Clement
(according to him) had done long before Lab. p. 565. Bin. page 65. col. 2.
.

. 2. From the Notes on Pope Pius Life Lab. p. 568. Bin. page 67. col. 2.
, we may observe there was no great care of old taken about the Pope's
Succession: For Optatus, S. Augustine, and S. Hierom, with the Old Pontifical
(before it was altered Cestriens. diss. 2. cap. 11. page 65.
, place Anicetus before Pius, but the Greeks place Puis before Anicetus; and in
this Binius thinks we are to believe them rather than the Latins. The rest of
the Notes are spent in vindicating an improbable Story, of an Angel bringing a
Decree about Easter to Hermes the Popes Brother, who writ a Book about keeping
it on the Lord's Day; yet after all there is a Book of Hermes now extant that
has nothing in it about Easter; and there was a Book of old writ by Hermes,
well known to the Greeks, and almost unknown to the Latins (though writ by a
Pope's Brother) read in the Eastern Churches, and counted Apocryphal in the
Western: But we want another Angel to come and tell us, whether that now extant
be the same or no, for Binius cannot resolve us, and only shows his Folly in
defending the absurd and incongruous Tales of the Pontifical.

Anicetus either lived before or after Pius, and the Pontifical makes him very
busy in Shaving his Priests Crowns, never mentioning what he did to suppress
those many Heretics who came to Rome in his time; but it tells us he was Buried
in the Coemetery of Calistus Lab. p. 579. Bin. page 72. col. 1.
, though Calistus (who gave that Burial-place a name) did not dye till Fifty
years after Anicetus. But Binius (who is loath to own this gross Falsehood)
says, You are to understand it in that ground which Calistus made a
Burying-place afterward; yet it unluckily falls out, that Anicetus's Successor

Pope Soter was also Buried (according to the Pontifical) in Calistus his
Coemetery; and afterward Pope Zepherines's Burial-place is described to be not
far from that of Calistus, so well was Calistus's Coemetery known, even before
it was made a Coemetery, and before he was Pope.

Eleutherius succeeded Soter, and as the Pontifical says, he received a Letter
from Lucius King of Britain, that he might be made a Christian by his Command;
which hint probably first produced those two Epistles between this Pope and
King Lucius Usserii Antiq. Brit. cap. 4, 5, etc. and ap. Spelm. Tom. I. Council.
, which Binius leaves out, though he justifies the Story, of which it were well
we had better Evidence than the Pontifical. This is certain, the Epistles were
forged in an Age when Men could write neither good Latin, nor good Sense; and I
am apt to fancy, if Isidore had put them into a Decretal, they would have been
somewhat more polite; so that it is likely these Epistles were made by some
Monks, who thought it much for our Honor, to have our Christianity from Rome.

. 3. This Century concludes with the bold Pope Victor, of whose excommunicating
the Eastern Bishops (for not agreeing with him about Easter) we have a large
account in Eusebius Eusebius. hist. lib. 5. cap. 23, 24, etc.
; but of that there is nothing in the Pontifical; only we are told he had a
Council at Rome, to which he called Theophilus (Bishop of Alexandria) and
decreed Easter should be observed upon a Sunday, etc. Upon this hint, and the
Authority of a better Author* we grant there were at these times diverse
Councils held about keeping Easter: But the Editors of the Councils (though
Eusebius be the only credible Author which gives an Account of them) presume to
contradict him. For Eusebius makes the Council at Caesarea in Palestina to be
first, and makes Theophilus of that City, and Narcissus of Jerusalem,
Presidents of it; but the Editors (for the honor of the Pope) place the Roman
Council first Lab. p. 596. Bin. page 79. col. 1, 2. Vid. Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 22.
, and upon the bare Credit of the Pontifical (who mistook Alexandria for
Caesarea) say, That Theophilus was present at it; whereas Eusebius says, This
Roman Council was the Second called about this Question, consisting of the
Bishops about Rome. Secondly, The Editors place the Council of Caesarea,
affirming out of a suspicious Fragment of Bid (who lived many Centuries
after,) That it was Called by Victor 's Authority; whereas Eusebius (as we see)
assigns other Presidents to that Council; yea, they entitle all the other
Councils about this Matter, Under Victor; though in Eusebius they are set down
as independent upon one another, The Bishops of each Country Calling them by
their own Authority. And though Binius's Notes Lab. p. 598. Bin. page 80. col.
1.
brag of Apostolical and Universal Tradition; The Bishops of Asia produced a
contrary Tradition, and called it Apostolical, for keeping Easter at a
different time; which shows how uncertain a ground Tradition is for Articles of
Faith, when it varied so much in delivering down a practical Rite through
little more than one Century: And the Asian Bishops persisting in their Custom,
and despising Victor's Excommunication, proves, They knew nothing of his
Supremacy or Infallibility in those days. We grant Victor was in the right as
to the time of Easter, and that which he and other Councils now agreed on, was
agreed upon also at the Council of Nice; but Binius stretches it too far when
he pretends, That general Council confirmed Victor's Sentence of Excommunition:
For Victor's Authority is never urged in the Nicene Council, nor his
Excommunication mentioned; and we know from Eusebius, That the Bishops of his
own Opinion severely reproved him for offering to pass so rash a Sentence, and
to impose his Sense upon remote Churches: So that thus far there is no genuine
Proof of any Supremacy exercised or claimed by the Roman Church; for the
Decretals, which only pretend to make it out, are notorious Forgeries.

CHAP. III. Of the Forgeries in the Third Century.
An. Dom. 203.
. 1. THis Century begins with the Life of Pope Zepherine, who Sat Eight years,
says the Pontifical; but the Notes tell you, He Sat Eighteen, which is a small
Error in that fabulous Author: Yet the Editors believe upon his Credit, that
this Pope ordered Vessels of Glass to be used in the Mass Lab. p. 603. Bin.
page 81. col. 1.
; and the Notes prove it by Pope Gregory the Great, who lived Four hundred
years after this time. However, if we allow the Matter of Fact upon the
Testimonies of S. Hierom and Epiphanius; it will follow, That in those Ages
(when they used Glass Cups) they did not believe Transubstantiation; for if
they had, they would not have ventured Christ's Blood in so brittle a Vessel,
but have forbid the use of Glasses, as they have done in the Roman Church since
this Opinion came in among them Daile de cult. relig. ap. Latin. lib. 2. cap.
22.
.

Under this Pope the Editors place an African Council, and say it was
Reprobated; yet they cannot make it appear, that this Pope so much as knew of
it. Nor was his Advice or Consent at all desired in that case, which was never
disputed at Rome till Pope Stephen's time (as themselves confess) viz. Fifty
years after this Council was held; from whence we learn, That every Province in
this Age believed they had sufficient Authority to determine Controversies in
Religion among themselves, without the Consent of the Bishop of Rome.

. 2. Though the Pontifical be guilty of many Errors in the Life of Calixtus,
and mistake the very Emperors under which he lived and died, the Notes gloss
them all fairly over Lab. p. 608. Bin. page 83. col. 1.
, and correct them by the Roman Martyrology, which often follows the
Pontifical, and is as fabulous as that. However we are told, That Calixtus was
buried Three Miles out of the City; because the Law of the Twelve Tables forbid
the Burying of a dead Body within the Walls. Now I would know, if this Law were
in force, how that can be true which the Pontifical and the Notes affirm and
justify, That S. Peter, Linus, Cletus, Euaristus, Sixtus, Telesphorus,
Hyginus, Pius, and Victor, were All Buried in the Vatican? And what shall we
think of the Miracles done by their Relics and at their Tombs, if no Body know
where they were first Buried?

Pope Urban, the Successor of Calixtus, is said in the Pontifical Lab. p. 617.
Bin. page 87. col. 1.
, to be Buried in the Coemetery of Praetextatus, which could not then be any
Coemetery at all, because Praetextatus was not Martyted till the Persecution
under Maximinus, which happened many years after: And if the Story of S. Cecily
in the same Author, be no Truer than his Chronology, the Romanists worship a
fictitious Saint.

The Pontifical is forced to feign, That the Emperor Alexander Severus was a
Persecutor, contrary to his Character in all Histories of Credit; and this only
to make us think, that Calixtus, Urban, and Pope Pontianus his Successor, were
Martyrs. However though Eusebius knew not of their Martyrdom Eusebius. hist. lib.
6. cap. 15, 17, and 22.
, the Roman Church adores them all as Martyrs, and have peculiar Days dedicated
to their Memories.

Antherus (as the Pontifical says) Sat Twelve years and One Month; and the
Notes say, that he Sat only one Month Lab. p. 629. Bin. page 92. col. 1.
; so that there is but only Twelve years mistaken in this Popes Life: And if he
was Pope but one Month, doubtless his Secretaries had need be very swift
Writers, or else they could not gather many in his time. However Binius will
make it out, for he brings in a Poetical Hyperbole, Of those Scribes, who could
write a Sentence before a man had spoken it; and so were as quick at guessing
as writing; and applies this in very serious earnest to this Pope's Notaries,
to make us imagine, there were many Acts of Martyrs writ out in this
short-lived Pope's time.

. 3. Pope Fabian, as Eusebius relates, was chosen by occasion of a Dove's
lighting on his Head, when the People were met to elect a Pope; of which
remarkable Story the fabulous Pontifical takes no notice, but tells us, That in
this Popes time Novatus the Heretic came to Rome Lab. p. 638. Bin. page 95.
col. 2.
; that is, say the Notes, Above a year after Pope Fabian was dead, after the
Vacancy, and in Pope Cornelius 's time; with such absurd Comments do these
Gentlemen delight to cover the Ignorance and Falsehood of their Historian; but
such Excuses do only more expose him. In this Pope's time were two Councils
held, one in Africa, the other in Arabia, and they Entitle them both under
Fabian; yet the only Authors, who mention these Councils, do not say Pope
Fabian was concerned in either of them Lab. p. 650. Bin. page 101. col. 2.
, and therefore they were not under Fabian.

After this Pope's death there was a Vacancy of more than one whole year, which
the Editors, to flatter the Papacy, call (in the style of Princes) An
Interregnum; but alas! their admired Monarchy, was now turned into an
Aristocracy, and the Clergy governed the Roman Church; to excuse which flaw in
their visible Monarchical Succession, the Notes say, The Members next the Head
knew it was their parts, to do the office of the Head: Which notable kind of
substitution, if it could be made out in the Body Natural, Beheading would not
be a Mortal punishment; however, they must say something to make us believe
there was always a Visible Head of the Catholic Church, or at least a Neck and
Shoulders, which stood for an Head, till Cornelius was chosen Pope: And they
called a Council (as they pretend) in this Vacancy, and writ a Letter of their
Determination to all the Churches in the World, that they might all observe
what the Empty Chair of Peter had ordered Bin. p. 107. col. 1.
. But if any one read the Letter it self, it will appear that this Council was
only a voluntary Assembly of the Clergy in Rome, and they met only to confirm
S. Cyprian's Opinion, and only writ their Letter to him; but never pretended
either to be Judges over Cyprian, or any other part of the Catholic Church.

Pope Cornelius his Life follows, for whose Character we are more obliged to S.
Cyprian's Epistles, than to the Pontifical, which invents an idle Story of a
Dialogue between Cornelius and Decius the Emperor; and though the Notes own Lab
p. 665 Bin. page 108. col. 1.
, That Decius (who is here pretended to Martyr him) dyed the same Month in
which Cornelius entered; yet they will not own the Story to be false, but boldly
put in the Name of Volusianus into their Margen instead of Decius. However, the
Breviary Breviar. Sixth. 5.16 die September.
retains the Fiction of Cornelius suffering under Decius, as it does also the
Fable of his Translating the Bodies of S. Peter and S. Paul: But let any
considering Man compare the different ways of telling this Sham Story, and he
will easily discern, that the Notes cannot reconcile them without flying to a
Miracle Lab. p. 667. Bin. page 108. col. 1.
. It is evident they have told us, the Body of S. Peter was in the Vatican,
when Pope Victor was there Buried, An. 203: And there is no Author of Credit
mentions their removal into the Catacumbae, and so consequently no reason to
believe they were fetched back from thence in a time of Persecution. Pope
Gregory lived 350 years after this, and was very apt to credit feigned
Miracles, and he differs much from the Pontifical; so that probably the whole
Story is forged, by those who long after began superstitiously to adore the
Relics of Saints. However, it is read in the Roman Church September. 16. and
many devout People on the Credit of this Legend make Pilgrimages, and offer
Prayers and large Gifts, to the Shrines of these two Apostles, of whose true
Relics they can have none, because their real Graves are not known.

In this Pope's time there were two Councils holden at Carthage, two at Rome,
and one in Italy; all which in the general Titles are said to be held under
Cornelius Lab. p. 714. Bin. page 126. col. 1.
; though the Notes assure us, That those two at Carthage were called by S.
Cyprian's Authority, and that the Italian Bishops made a Decree of their own,
besides that of Cornelius at Rome. The Roman Councils indeed were holden under
Cornelius, as being Bishop of that City; but we may observe, He did not
Authoritatively confirm the Sentence of the Council of Carthage, but only
contented to it. We may also Note, This African Council calls not Pope
Cornelius Father, but Brother, and writes to him as one of their Colleagues;
yea, they do not except Cornelius, when they Decree, That if any of their
Colleagues agreed not to their Sentence, he should answer it at the Day of
Judgment Lab. p. 718. Bin. page 128. col. 1.
. Moreover, in the same Letter there is an evident Testimony, that the People
in those days were prepared for Martyrdom, by receiving the Eucharistical Cup
Lab. p. 717. Bin. page 127. col. 2.
; which being now denied to the Laity, the Editors pass it by without a Note;
yet soon after, where the Council plainly speaks of Confessing the Name of
Christ before Persecutors; they have this impertinent Marginal Note, From this
and other places, the necessity of Confession is confirmed: As if this belonged
to their new invented Auricular Confession.

. 4. The Notes find diverse Faults in the Life of Pope Lucius, yet they would
palliate the grossest of all; for the Pontifical says, He was Beheaded by
Valerian; the Notes affirm it was by Gallus and Volusianus; and yet the same
Notes tell us, The Pontifical (in saying it was by Valerian) may be very well
and truly expounded Lab. p. 720. Bin. page 128. col. 2.
. The Reader must understand, It may be so expounded by such kind of Notes, as
are designed to make gross Errors seem great Truths.

Pope Stephen, who succeeded Lucius, fell out with Cyprian and the African
Bishops, about the re-baptizing of Heretics, which (though it were the only
memorable thing in this Popes Life) the Pontifical never mentions: And the
Editors are are so used to put into the Title of all Councils, Under such or
such a Pope, that in this Popes time they style those very Councils, Sub
Stephano, which were called without his knowledge, and which condemned his
Opinion Lab. p 751. page 760, etc. Bin. page 137, 141, 145, etc.
, as may be seen in the Councils of Carthage, Iconium, and Africa, where (so
easily may Tradition be mistaken) the Rebaptizing of Heretics is asserted to be
an Apostolic Tradition, though it were contrary to Pope Stephen's Opinion, and
the Tradition of the Roman Church. And when Stephen on this account presumed to
Excommunicate the Asian Bishops, Firmilianus (Bishop of Coesarea) in a Letter
to S. Cyprian Lab. p. 751. Bin. page 141. col. 2.
, Despises his Sentence, compares the Pope to Judas, complains of his
Arrogance, and esteems those to be very silly who took the Roman Bishop's word
for an Apostolical Tradition; from which that Church in many Instances had
departed. Moreover, He calls him a Schismatic, and affirms, he had by this rash
Sentence only cut himself off from the Unity of the Catholic Church. S. Cyprian
also, and his Africans Lab. p. 765. Bin. page 147. col. 2.
, condemned this Pope as a Favourer of Heretics, an Enemy to the Church, and
one who writ Contradictions, and was void of Prudence; describing him as an
Innovator and bringer in of Traditions, contrary to God's Word, as one who
obstinately presumed to prefer human Doctrines before Scripture. I grant Pope
Stephen was in the right in this Controversy; yet doubtless, if these Bishops
had believed the Supremacy, and Infallibility of the Pope and his Roman
Council, they could not have used him at this rate: And the Editors are so
concerned to cover this rough usage, that they reprint an Epistle of S.
Cyprian's Verbatim Lab. p. 740. and page 764. Bin. page 136. col. 2. and p.
146, col. 2.
, after this Quarrel was grown hot, which was writ while they two were Friends,
and contains very kind Words to Stephen; which Blind is only to make us think
that Cyprian submitted to the Pope at last, though it is apparent he never did
so: Again, the Reader may note that Labbe here prints a Tract of some Ancient
Author, to justify the Pope's Opinion; but though there be many good Arguments
for it from other Topics, the Argument from Tradition, and the determination of
the Roman Church, is not urged in the whole Discourse Lab. p. 770.
, which shows that these were no Arguments allowed in this Writers time: Lastly
whereas the third Council of Carthage, severely censures Pope Stephen for
taking upon him as Bishop of Bishops, and for compelling his Equals by
Tyrannical Terrors to obey him Lab. p. 786. Bin. page 149. col. 2. and p. 154.
col. 2.
: Binius impudently notes upon this, that the Pope was called Bishop of
Bishops, to him was the last Refuge in Matters of Faith, and his Determinations
were received all the World over as the Oracles of the Holy Ghost: Which is
from his Usurping a Title and Authority, to infer he had Right to them; and to
prove that all the World received his Determinations, from a Story which shows,
that half the Christian World rejected them.

. 5. The Life of Sixtus the Second, in the Pontifical is one heap of Errors,
for the Author seems to mistake him for Xystus the Philosopher; and as the
Notes confess, make Decius raise a great Persecution against the Church, Eight
year after he was Dead. He also places Valerian before Decius, supposing them
to Reign together, and saying Sixtus was Beheaded by Valerian in Decius's time
Lab. p. 819. Bin. page 155. col. 1.
; now Decius was slain two year before Valerian was Emperor: Yet the Notes
labor to color over all these Contradictions, to Salve the Credit of their
Missals and Fabulous Martyrology.

Dionysius the next Pope, is said to have been a Monk, upon the credit of the
Pontifical Lab. p. 827. Bin. page 158. col. 1.
; the Notes add that he Lived a Solitary Life, before his Election; yet the
Modern Monks have given over that Primitive Custom, and now crowd into great
Cities: But the Pontifical is so miserably mistaken in the Consuls in this
Popes Life, placing those for his last Consuls who were so, two years before
those he Names for his first Consuls, that nothing can be believed on this
Authors credit. Under this Pope the Editors have feigned a Council at Rome, to
which Dionysius Bishop of Alexandria was Cited, and so far obeyed the Order, as
to write an Epistle to clear himself, for which they cite Athanasius Lab. p.
830. Bin. page 160. col. 1.
: But we must never trust their Quotations where the Supremacy is concerned,
without looking into the Authors they cite: And Athanasius only says Dionysius
of Alexandria was accused at Rome, and writ to the Pope to know the Articles
complained of, who sent him an Account, upon which he vindicated himself by an
Apology: But what is all this to a Roman Council, or a citing Dionysius
thither? There were also two Councils at Antioch, about this time as Eusebius
tells us Eusebius. hist. lib. 7. cap. 22.
; But the Editors of their own Head put in that the first of them, was
appointed by Dionysius Bishop of Rome, to whom the chief care of the Church was
committed -- Whereas Eusebius never mentions this Pope as being either
concerned in the Council, or consulted about it: but if they will have it under
Dionysius, then we may infer, that this Pope approved a saying of this Council,
viz. That they knew of no other Mediator between God and Man but only Christ
Jesus. The Second Council of Antioch is entitled also, Under Pope Dionysius:
Yet it appears by Eusebius Eusebius. hist. lib. 7. cap. 24.
, that this Pope knew not of the Council, till they by their Synodical Epistle
informed him of it after they were risen: And in that Epistle they join him,
and Maximus Bishop of Alexandria together as Colleagues and equals, not desiring
either of them to confirm their Decrees; but acquainting them with their
proceedings, they required them to show their consent by writing Communicatory
Letters to Domnus, who was put in by them, Bishop of Antioch, in the Room of
Paulus Samosatenus, ejected for Hersie; and though this Domnus his Father,
Demetrianus had been Bishop of Antiocb before, yet we hear of no Papal
Dispensation to allow him to succeed there: We may also observe, that
Firmilianus (who in Pope Stephens time so much despised the Popes Authority and
Infallibility) is by this Council called a Man of blessed Memory: By which we
see how little any Ancient and genuine Councils do countenance the Supremacy of
the Roman Church, and what need they had to forge Evidence, who would have it
taken for a Primitive Doctrine.

. 6. That Foelix the First was a Martyr, is proved only by the Pontifical, and
the Roman Martyrology which often blindly follows it; but why may not the
Pontifical be mistaken in the Martyrdom, as well as the Notes confess it to be
in the Consuls Lab. p. 903. Bin. page 163. col. 1.
? And the base Partiality of the Notes appears soon after in citing a place of
S. Cyprian, as if he desired to know the Days on which the Martyrs suffered,
that he might offer a Sacrifice for them by Names on their Anniversaries Cypr
lib. 3. ep. 6. vel epist. 37. page 81. vid. Daile de cult. relig. Lat. lib. 3.
cap. 3. page 352.
; whereas Cyprian speaks of the Confessors who died privately in Prisons, of
whose Names he desires to be informed, that he might celebrate their Memory
among the Martyrs: Now there is a great difference between S. Cyprian's and the
Protestants practice, to Commemorate the Saints departed; and the Roman way, of
offering the Sacrifice of the Mass for the deceased: Yet the Notes would suborn
S. Cyprian to give in evidence for this corrupt practice.

Pope Eutychianus lived not long before Eusebiu's time, and he says he only
sat ten Months Eusebius. hist. lib. 7. cap. 26.
; The Pontifical allows him thirteen Months, but the Notes boldly say he was
Pope Eight years Lab. p. 913. Bin. page 167. col. 2.
, and this only upon the Names of two Consuls set down in the Pontifical, and
the credit of the Roman Martyrology; but since these two are scarce ever right
in their Chronology, we ought to believe Eusebius rather than the Annotator and
his despicable Witnesses.

His Successor Gaius lived in Eusebius's own time, and he affirms he sat
Fifteen years Eusebius. hist. lib. 7. cap. 26.
; but the Pontifical allots to him Eleven years only, and so does the Breviary
Brev. Roman. April. 22.
; both of them making him Dioclesian's Kinsman, (which Eusebius knew nothing
of;) The Notes out of Baronius contradict them all, and ascribe to him Twelve
years, making him Dioclesian's Nephew; and yet the Pontifical says both that
he fled from Dioclesian's Persecution, and died a Confessor. Yet was Crowned
with Martyrdom with his Brother Gabinius; which Nonsense Baronius and the
Notes also defend.

. 7. This Century is concluded by the Uunfortunate Marcellinus, who as the
Pontifical tells us, did Sacrifice to Idols Lab. p. 930. Bin. page 174. col. 2.
; and S. Augustine in the Notes plainly supposes it to be true: Yet the
Annotator (who dares not deny it) labors to Amuse the Reader by saying, this
Story may be plainly refuted and proved false by diverse probable Reasons out of
Baronius; but because their Missals and Martyrology do own the thing, he will
not go that way to Work: What then? Does he clearly charge the Infallible Judge
with Apostasy? No, he says, He seemed to deny the Faith by External acts,
(that is, Sacrificing to Idols;) Yet by his Internal acts, (it seems Binius
knew his thoughts) he did not believe any thing contrary to the Faith: And
truly this is an early Instance of Jesuitical Equivocation: But we may make the
same Excuse for all the Apostates in the World; and it is plain the Notes care
not what they say, to protect their dear Infallibility against the most
convincing Truths.

About the very time of this Pope 's Apostasy was held a Council at Cirta in
Africa; and though S. Augustine, the Author from whom they have all they know
about it, say not one Word of Marcellinus, Yet the Editors and Annotator both,
put in these Words, that it was under Marcellinus Lab. p. 936. Bin. page 177.
col. 1, 2.
; Where I cannot but wonder, that (since they have invented a Council in the
same year to set poor Marcellinus Right again, after his Apostasy;) they did
not place that Council first, and then their reconciled Penitent might with a
better Grace, have sat at Cirta and Condemned such as fell in the Persecution.

But the most Infamous Forgery, is the Ridiculous Council of Sinuessa Lab. p.
938. Bin. page 178.
, devised by some dull Monk, who could write neither good Sense nor true Latin,
inspired only by a blind Zeal for the Roman Church, whose Infallible Head must
be cleared from Apostasy, though it be by the absurdest Fictions imaginable:
For he feigns this Apostate Pope met Three-hundred Bishops near Sinuessa, in
Dioclesian's time in a Cave, which would hold but Fifty of them at once, and
their business was only to hear Marcellinus condemn himself, and to tell him he
could be Judged by none. The two first Copies of this Council were so stuffed
with Barbarisms, false Latin and Nonsense, and so contrary to each other, that
some Body took Pains out of both to devise a third Copy, and by changing and
adding at pleasure, brought it at last to some tolerable Sense: Surius and
Binius print all three Copies, but Labbe and the Collectio regia leave out the
two Originals, and only publish the Third, dressed up by a late Hand, which in
time may pass for the true account of this Council. But the two first Copies in
Binius, yet extant, will give the Reader a good proof into what depths of
Ignorance the Monks were fallen, when such Unintelligible and Incoherent stuff
as this, and the Letters Forged between the Council of Nice and Pope Sylvester,
(which are in the same Style,) were designed to support the Roman Supremacy and
Infallibility. I shall not reflect upon the Absurdity, of making the Pope his
own Judge, when he denies the Fact, nor the Contradiction of the Councils,
saying often They must not judge him; and yet declaring soon after That they
have Condemned him Bin. p. 179. 180, and 183.
: Whoever will but read this Council over, shall find diversion enough, if
Blunders and Dullness be diverting to them. I shall therefore principally note
the gross Partiality and Fallacies of the Notes, in coloring over this
barefaced Forgery: First, the Annotator accuses the Century Writers, and
English Innovators for rejecting this Rare Council as a Forgery of the
Donatists, he should have said of the Romish Monks; yet he makes more
Objections against it, than he himself can answer: Protestants wonder that
Three-hundred Bishops should dare to meet in times of Persecution: He replies,
a far less number did meet on a slighter occasion Fifty years before, which is
but a very indifferent Proof: Well, but to magnify the occasion, he says, By
this Pope's fall, not only the Roman Church, but the whole Christian Religion
was in extreme danger; and in the President of the Catholic Faith, the very
Foundation of the Church was shaken and almost ruined: Yet a little before he
had told us out of S. Augustine, that Marcellinus's fall did no prejudice to
the Church, and had affirmed that the ill Deeds of Bishops may hurt themselves,
but cannot prejudice the Churches Orthodox Doctrine Bin. p. 175. col. 1. 2.
: Again, he proves it could not be an Invention of the Donatists, because they
never knew of it; yet presently he owns they objected it to the Catholics, and
therefore must know of it, all that S. Augustine says, being only that they
could not prove it: After this Baronius and he say, that no Writer does mention
this City of Sinuessa, nor is there any Memory of such a place or Cave: Which
is a great mistake in them both. For Livy, Cicero, Ovid, Martial and Pliny, do
all speak of Sinuessa Ferarij Lexic. Geograph. p. 199.
, and Alexander ab Alexandro, mentions a famous Highway, leading from Rome to
this City Al. ab. Alexand. genesis dier. lib. 3. cap. 13.
. And if an Earthquake have since Overthrown it, that will not prove there was
no such City then: all the Wonder is that these Gentlemen should defend a
Council for genuine, which they thought had been held in Utopia: The Notes
proceed to tell us that Very many most Learned Men, (not Heretics, I suppose)
by very strong Arguments have labored to prove these Acts spurious: But he
(who values no Arguments against the Supremacy,) not only thinks them not to be
false, but judges them worthy of great Esteem for their Venerable Antiquity,
and for their Majesty which extorts Reverence even from the unwilling: Now
their Antiquity cannot be proved by one Old Author, and their Majesty is so
little, that they extort Laughter and Contempt from the gravest Reader: Let us
therefore hear his Reason for this Approbation, it is because they are believed
by general consent of all; (He forgets that he said but now, very many and very
Learned Men did not believe them;) And because they are received and retained
without any Controversy to this Day, in the Martyrologies and Breviaries of the
Roman and other Churches Brev. Roman. April. 26.
: So that at last, all the Authority for this Council is the Roman Martyrology
and Breviary; which are Modern Collections, out of the Fabulous Pontifical and
other Forged Acts of Martyrs; And though their own Learned Men by good
Arguments prove the things to be false, yet if they be Read in a Breviary, etc.
these Falsehoods become true, and Catholics receive them without Controversy:
Yea, they cite the Transcript of a Forgery to prove the Original to be a Truth.
Again, the Notes say it is no prejudice to the Truth of Marcellinus his fall,
though the Africans did not know of it, nor S. Augustine, no nor any of the
African Church: Yet in the next Page it is observed, That there are very many
Names of the Witnesses which prove his fall, which are peculiar to the African
Christians: Now if these Names were peculiar to the Africans, then these
Witnesses were of the African Church Originally, and then it is Morally
impossible, that they should never tell none of their Countrymen, of so Famous
a Transaction: The Notes confess that these Acts often mention Libra occidua;
which is a Word invented after the Empire was divided into East and West: And
thence the same Notes infer, these Acts were not writ in those Ancient times;
yet they make it a wonder, that they were not seen in Africa in S. Augustine 's
time or before: Which is to wonder that they had not seen them in Africa,
before they were written: It puzzles the Annotator to make out an excuse for
that ridiculous Falsehood in these Acts, that Marcellinus was led into the
Temple of Vesta, and Isis, and there Sacrificed to Hercules, Jupiter and
Saturn; because these Gods were never placed, nor Worshipped in the Temples of
those female Deities: Nor can he allow what the Acts say about this Council,
being held when Dioclesian was in his Persian War; for he affirms it was held
Two years after that War, when Dioclesian had divested himself of the Empire,
and lived a private Life; But then the Acts make Dioclesian to be present, and
in Rome when Marcellinus did Sacrifice; and at this rate the Pope would have
laid two years at least in his Apostasy, which the Annotator must not endure.
To conclude, we now see, That a Council held no body knows where nor when,
concealed from all Ancient Authors, writ in later times, full of Barbarisms,
and Nonsense, Falsehoods and contradictions, if it do but pretend to make out
the Supremacy and Infallibity of the Pope, and set him (while he was an
Apostate and falsely denied the Fact,) above a Council of Three hundred Innocent
Bishops; if it do but say the Pope, though never so wicked, cannot be judged by
any but himself: This Council shall be published by the Roman Editors, and
vindicated by partial Notes, as if it were a most genuine and Authentic Truth:
From whence it is plain, That these Editors, and especially this Annotator has
no other measure of Truth and Falsehood, but the Interest of the Roman Church,
which they resolve to promote, though it be by the most unjust means. And this
may suffice to observe for the Third Century.

A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE Roman Forgeries. IN THE VOLUMES OF THE COUNCILS, For
the Fourth Century. PART II.
CHAPTER IV. Of the Forgeries in the Fourth Century.
. 1. THis Century begins with the Life of Marcellus, An. Dom. 304.
a Pope so obscure, that Eusebius's Chronicle wholly omits him Lab. Tom. III.
page 947. Bin. Tom. I. page 185. col. 2.
; and Theodoret knew nothing of him, nor of Pope Eusebius, but makes Melchiades
immediate Successor to Marcellinus Theod. hist. lib. 1 cap. 3.
. It is very observable, that these two unknown Popes, in the Notes on their
Lives, are said to have sat Seven years between them: And the Pontifical says,
There was a Vacancy of Seven years after Marcellinus, which Vacancy is also
asserted by Anastasius Biblioth. by Luit prandus, Abbo Floriacens. Cusanus, and
Genebrard Richer. de Eccles. potestate cap 3. page 46.
. And though Baronius's and Binius's Notes, deny this Seven years Vacancy, it
is upon mere Conjectures: The Scandal of so long a Vacancy no doubt, setting
some of the old Parasites of Rome on work, to invent two Popes Names and put
them into the List, from whence probably they have been foisted into Optatus
and S. Augustine, two Latin Fathers, while the Greek Authors (which these
Forgers Understood not) do continue Uncorrupted: And truly nothing but the
Names of these two Popes remain; for no good Historian mentions any one Eminent
Act done by either of them; however, the Annotator had rather fill up his Scene
with empty Names of Feigned Popes, who did nothing for Seven years together,
than let the Reader suppose the Catholic Church could so long want its
pretended Head. But though the Notes allow not the Authority of the Pontifical
for the Vacancy, they trust it for the fictitious Story of this Marcellus his
Life, and would have us believe, That in a time of Persecution this Pope
appointed Twenty five Churches in Rome, to Baptize Converts and Bury Martyrs
in; and though the Laws and Customs of that City then, forbad to Bury dead
Bodies within the Walls, we are to believe that the Tyrant Maxentius (who made
all these Martyrs, and persecuted this very Pope) consented to his breaking
this Ancient Law. On the Credit of the same Pontifical we are told, That a
certain Lady, called Lucina, dedicated her House to this Pope (while He was
alive) by the Title of S. Marcellus; and that the Emperor turned it into a
Stable, and made the Pope his Beast-keeper there, where Naked, and clothed
with Sackcloth, (they are the Words of the Pontifical) He soon after ended his
days, the 17th of the Kalends of February Breviar. Romans Jan. 16. page 674.
. Which Fiction the Roman Breviary orders to be read to the Credulous People of
that Communion for Lessons; and tells them, That Marcellus writ an Epistle to
the Bishops of the Antiochian Province about the Roman Primacy, and to prove
Rome to be the Head of All Churches, and that no Synod should be held without
the Pope's Authority. But this Epistle Lab. p. 948. Bin. page 186. col. 1.
is owned by Labbe to be a Forgery, patched up out of diverse Modern Authors,
citing the Vulgar Latin Version, and dated after Marcellus his death: And it is
very strange, That times of Persecution should be a proper Season for a Pope to
wrangle for his Supremacy: Yet this Notorious Forgery says, Christ ordered S.
Peter, to Translate his Seat from Antioch to Rome; and that the Apostles by
Inspiration decreed, That all Appeals should be made thither, and no Council
held, but by the Authority of the Roman Church. For which cause Binius
vindicates it with Notes as full of Falsehood as the Epistle it self Lab. p 950
Bin. page 187. col 1.
: His first Note of this Epistle being writ to one Solomon a Bishop, is an
oversight, and belongs to the first Epistle of Pope Marcellinus Bin. p. 175.
col. 2. Baron. An. 296.. 5.
. His next Notes about the Primacy and Power of Calling Synods, cite an
Apostolical and Nicene Canon for it; but no such Canons are to be found. He
quotes also two Epistles, one writ to Pope Foelix from Alexandria; another writ
by Pope Julius, to the Eastern Churches, for proof of this Supremacy; and the
same Annotator afterward owns them both to be Forgeries Bin. Not. in Epist.
Foel. p. 499 and Not. in Ep. Julii, page 385.
. He falsely says, Dioscorus was Condemned at Chalcedon, only for holding a
Synod without the Pope's Consent; whereas he is known to have been accused of
many other Crimes. His Text of Pasce oves, is nothing to this purpose; nor will
Pope Pelagius his Word be taken in his own Cause. His Story of Valentinian
makes nothing for the Pope, more than any other Bishop; Yea, the Bishops
desiring him to call a Council, shows, They thought it was His Prerogative; and
Nicephorus relates his Answer to have been, That he was so taken up with State
Affairs, that he had no leisure to enquire into those matters Niceph. lib. 2.
cap. 3. and Whitak. de Council. page 51.
: Wherefore after all this elaborate Sophistry, to justify a false Assertion
of a Forged Epistle, the Annotator has only showed his partiality for the
Pope's Power, but made no proof of it.

The second Epistle of this Marcellus (to the Tyrant Maxentius) is also a
manifest Forgery Lab. p. 951. Bin. page 387. col. 1.
; part of it is taken out of his Successor Gregory's Epistles, writ almost
Three hundred years after this; and it is highly improbable, That a persecuted
Pope should falsely, as well as ridiculously, to a Pagan Emperor, quote the Laws
of the Apostles, and their Successors, forbidding to persecute the Church and
Clergy; and also instruct him about the Roman Churches power in Calling Synods,
and Receiving Appeals; and cite Clement's Forged Epistle as an Authority to
Maxentius, That Laymen must not accuse Bishops. The Notes indeed are unwilling
to lose such precious Evidence, and so pretend, That Maxentius at this time
dissembled himself, to be a Christian; but this Sham can signify nothing to
such as read the Epistle, where Marcellus complains, That he then persecuted
him most unjustly, and therefore he did not pretend to be a Christian at that
time; and consequently the whole Epistle is an absurd Forgery: And so is that
Decree subjoyned to it, which supposes young Children offered to Monasteries,
and Shaved or Veiled there; Customs which came up diverse Centuries after this.

. 2. The Canons of Peter, Bishop of Alexandria Lab. p. 967. Bin. page 189. col.
1.
, are genuine, and a better Record of Ecclesiastical Discipline, than any Pope
to this time ever made; the Reader also may observe, the Bishop of Rome is not
once named in these Canons; and they plead Tradition for the Wednesday Fast,
contrary to the Roman Churches pretense, of having an Apostolical Tradition, to
Fast on Saturday.

The Council of Elliberis in Spain, An. Dom. 305.
is by Binius placed under Pope Marcellus; which Words Labbe leaves out of the
Title Lab. p. 967. E Bin. page 191. col. 1.
, and justly; for if there were such a Pope, the Council takes no notice of
him, nor is it likely, that Rome did know of this Council till many years
after. Yet it is both Ancient and Authentic, though Mendoza in Labbe Lab. p.
1030.
, reckons up diverse Catholic Authors, Caranza, Canus, Baronius, etc. who either
wholly reject it, or deny the 34th, 35th, 36th, and 40th Canons of it, which
condemn the Opinions now held at Rome: And though Binius (because Pope Innocent
approves it) dare not reject it; yet he publishes Notes to make the Reader
believe, it does not condemn any of their Opinions or Practices.

The 13th Canon speaks of Virgins, who dedicated themselves to God; but
mentions not their being Veiled, or Living in Monasteries; which Customs came
in long after, as the Authors cited in the Notes show Lab. p. 983. D Bin. page
200. col. 1.
.

The 26th Canon calls it an Error, to Fast upon Saturday: But the Notes are so
bold as to say, The Error which this Council corrected, was the not Fasting on
Saturday; whereas even these very Notes confess, That the Eastern Churches, and
most of the Western, ( Rome, and some few others excepted) together with the
African Church, did not Fast on Saturday, but Wednesday; yea, those they Call
the Apostolical Canons, and Clement's Constitutions, do both establish
Wednesday Fast, and condemn their pretended Apostolical Churches Saturday Fast;
and if diverse in Spain (as the Notes say) in S. Hierom's and Pope Innocent's
times, did not Fast on Saturday, and others then needed Arguments to settle
them in this Roman practice: It may be gathered from thence, that in the time
of this Council, the Saturday Fast was esteemed an Error, as it was also in
that Age almost in all Christian Churches, and so the very Words of the Canon
import, which Baronius saw, and therefore Baron. Annal. An. 305.. 49.
only says, There is mention of the Saturday Fast in this Synod; and so passes
it, knowing it plainly contradicted the Roman Churches Tradition.

The 34th Canon (under pain of Excommunication) forbids the lighting Wax
Candles in the places where the Martyrs were Buried (q); Lab. p. 985. E Bin.
page 201. col. 1.
which agrees with the Sentiments of the Primitive Church Daile de cultu Lat.

. Lactantius condemns Lighting Candles in God's Worship by day, as a Paganish
Superstition Lactant. Instit. lib. 6. cap. 2.
. S. Hierom says, It was used in his time only by such as did it to humor the
silly Vulgar, who had a Zeal without Knowledge Hieron. ad Ripar. ep. 53.
. Yet the Notes confess this is the Custom of the Roman Church; for which only
cause some of their Doctors reject this Canon (since nothing must be Authentic,
which condemns their Novel Superstitions) and these Notes make a miserable
Blunder to excuse the matter; but we are not concerned, whether (with the
Annotator) these Candles in the Daylight disturb the Spirits of the Living
Saints, by seeing an Heathenish Rite brought into the Church, or (with
Baronius) displease the Saints Deceased, to behold so Superstitious a thing
vainly devised for their honor. Since it sufficiently appears, the practice is
novel and absurd, and (though now used at Rome) condemned by the best
Antiquity. The Notes also give us one extraordinary distinction Bin. Not. in 34
and 35 Can. p. 201. col. 2.
, between the Souls of deceased Saints in Heaven, and those in Purgatory; which
latter sort, if they had been Saints, one would think should need no such
dreadful Scouring.

The 36th Canon determines, That Pictures ought not to be in Churches, and that
none may Paint upon Walls that which is worshipped Lab. p. 986. Bin page 201.
col. 2.
: Which so expressly condemns the Roman Worship of Pictures and Images, that the
boldest Writers of that Church reject this Canon; but others (as the Notes say)
would gladly expound it so, as to assert the honor and worship due to Holy
Images; (which is a notable kind of Exposition, to make a Canon assert that,
which it confutes:) But such transparent Fallacies deserve rather derision,
than serious Arguments. Sanders and Turrian observe, That these Fathers forbid
not Images, which Christians might take away and hide; but Pictures, which they
must leave exposed to Pagan abuses. But might not this have been prevented, by
hanging up their Pictures in Frames? and are not large Images as difficult to
be removed and concealed as Pictures? Yea, does not the present Roman Church
adore Pictures as well as Images? so that still this Canon condemns them.
Martinez fancies, This Council forbid Painting on the Walls, lest the Pictures
should be deformed by the decay of those Walls: But he forgets, that the
Council first forbids them to be any where in the Church; and were not Walls as
subject to decay in the time of the Second Nicene Council, as they are now? And
had not those Fathers as great an honor for Pictures, as these at Elliberis?
yet the Nicene Picture-Worshipers, order them to be painted on Church-Walls.
Martinez adds, That as times vary, human Statutes vary; and so the Second
Council of Nice made a quite contrary Decree. What! are Decrees of Councils
about Matters of Divine Worship, only human Statutes? what will become of the
Divine Authority and Apostolical Tradition, pretended for this Worship of old
at Nice, and now at Rome, if the Orders against it and for it be both human and
mutable Statutes? It is well however, that the Patrons of Image Worship do own,
they have altered and abrogated a Primitive Canon, for one made Four hundred
years after, in times of Ignorance and Superstition; and we know, whether of
the two we ought to prefer. Baronius is more ingenuous, who says Baron. An.
305.. 45.
, These Bishops at Elliberis chiefly endeavored, by strict Penalties, to
affright the Faithful from Idolatry; wherefore they made the 34th, 36th and
37th Canons; and by comparing the First Canon with the Forty sixth, it appears,
they dealt more severely with an Idolater, than an Apostate. From whence we
infer, That Pictures in Churches tend to Idolatry, in this Councils Opinion.
Albaspinaeus (whose Notes Labbe here prints Lab. p. 998
) would enervate this Canon, by saying, It forbids not the Saints Pictures; but
those which represented God and the Holy Trinity. But it is not probale, these
Primitive Christians were so ignorant, as to need any prohibition about such
blasphemous Representations of God's Majesty. And he brings no proof, but his
own bare Conjecture for this limitation of the Canon; which Fancy (if it were
true) would prove, That the Saints were not worshipped or adored in that Age,
because nothing that was worshipped and adored, was to be painted on the Walls;
and if that be meant only of God and the Trinity, then nothing else but God and
the Trinity was adored in those days: Finally, the former part of the Canon
destroys this limitation, by excluding Pictures in general out of Churches.
These are the various Fallacies by which these partial Editors, would hide the
manifest Novelty of their Churches, Worship of Pictures, which cannot be
defended by all these Tricks.

I will only add, That this genuine Ancient Council in the Fifty third Canon,
Orders, The same Bishop who Excommunicated a Man, to Absolve him; and that if
any other intermedled, He should be called to an account for it Lab. p. 976.
Bin. page 196. C
; without excepting the Pope, or taking notice of Marcellus's pretended claim
of Appeals.

. 3. In the Year 306, was a Council at Carthage against the Donatists, which
never takes any notice of the Pope; yet they put into the Title of it, Under
Marcellus Lab. p. 1379. Bin. page 202. C
. But there is a worse Forgery in the Notes, where S. Augustine is cited, as
saying, That Cecilian ( Bishop of Carthage) despised the Censures of the
Donatists, because he was joined in Communion with the Bishop of the Roman
Church, from which all Catholic Communion, was ever wont to be denominated: But
this is Baronius his false gloss, not S. Augustine's words, who only says, --
because he was united by Communicatory Letters, both to the Roman Church,
wherein the Principality of the Catholic Church had always flourished, and to
other Lands from whence the Gospel came to Africa Aug. ep. 62. Tom. Il. p. 150.
Vid. Baron. An. 306.. 40.
. Now there is great difference between a Man's being a Catholic, because he was
in Communion with Rome (then Orthodox) and with other Churches; and his being a
Catholic merely for being in Communion with the Roman Bishop, which is the
modern and false notion of the word Catholic, among Papists, in our days: But
Binius was so convinced, that S. Augustine's words confuted Baronius's
Paraphrase, that he cunningly leaves them out, to make this commodious Sense of
them go better down with careless Readers.

. 4. The next Pope Eusebius, was so obscure, (as the Notes on his Life declare)
that no Writer mentions any thing of him that is memorable Lab. p. 1380. Bin.
page 203. col. 1.
; and it is probable, there never was such a Pope: Yet the Pontifical says,
The Cross was found in his time, upon the 5th of the Nones of May, which is the
very Day on which the Roman Church now celebrates The Invention of the Cross:
And the Third Decretal Epistle of this Pope, was devised on purpose to support
this Story; yet both Baronius and Binius reject it for a Fable, even while
their Church still observes that Holy Day. There are Three Epistles forged for
this Name of a Pope, all which Labbe owns to be spurious Lab. p. 1381. Bin.
page 203. col. 1.
; and I need not spend much time to prove it, since they cite the Vulgar Latin
Version, and are mostly stolen out of Modern Authors, (as Labbe's Margen
shows) having only one Consul's Name for their Dates, because no other was
named in the Pontifical. Besides, the first Epistle uses the Phrase, Pro
salvatione servorum Dei, which is not the Latin of that Age; and talks of
Rigorous Tortures used among Christians, to make Witnesses confess Truth. The
second Epistle repeats the foolish Argument, of Christ's whipping the Buyers
and Sellers (many of which were Laymen) out of the Temple, to prove, that God
alone must judge Priests; and out of a much later Roman Council, (suspected
also of Forgery) speaks of the Peoples not judging their Bishop, unless he err
in Matter; of Faith --; and discourses of Edicts of Kings, forbidding to try an
ejected Bishop, till he be restored to his place. The third Epistle has the
Fable of the Invention of the Cross, and all other Marks of Forgery on it; yet
Bellarmine cites it to prove, the Pope's Succession to S. Peter, in his
Universal Monarchy; and to make out Confirmation to be a Sacrament Bellarm. de
Pontif. Romans lib. 2. cap. 14. and de Confirm. lib. 2. cap. 3.
. So little do those Writers value the credit of any Evidence, if it do but
make for their Churches Authority, or support its Doctrines.

5. The Seven years Vacancy being now expired, Melchiades was chosen Pope, and
Sat Three years and Seven Months, according to the Pontifical Lab. p. 1394.
Bin. page 209. col. 1.
; and though the Ecclesiastical Tables (as they call them) generally follow
this Author; yet Baronius here by them corrects the Pontifical, and allows
Melchiades only Two Years and Two Months: But all this is Conjecture, for he
grants the Consuls in the Pontifical are so false, that they cannot be
reconciled to Truth Baron. An. 311.. 43.
; whence it follows, That the Decretal Epistle ascribed to this Pope, whose
Matter is taken from the Pontifical, and whose Date is by those who were not
Consuls till after Melchiades's Death Lab. p. 1400. A. in Marg.
, must be false also: Yet the Notes defend this Forged Epistle, and Bellarmine
cites it for the Supremacy, and for Confirmations being a Sacrament Bellarmin.
ubi supra (e).
, whereas the beginning of it is stolen out of Celestine's Epistle to the
French Lab. p. 1395. D, E.
; it quotes the Vulgar Translation, and cites an Apostolical Privilege granted
to Rome, for the sole right of Trying Bishops; to justify which, The Notes
cite the 73d and 74th Apostolical Canons; but those Canons, order Bishops to
judge an offending Bishop, and make the last appeal to a Synod, without taking
any notice of Rome, or of this pretended Privilege. Again, this Feigned
Epistle impudently makes Confirmation more venerable than Baptism; and the
Notes defend that bold Expression: But we cannot but wonder, (since they
assert, That Bishops by Gods Law have the sole power of Confirming;) the same
Men should grant, That the Pope can give a Priest leave to Confirm, Which yet
(they say) changes not the Divine Right of Bishops Lab. p. 1400. E. Bin. p.
211. col. 2.
; That is in plain terms, One man's sole Right may be delegated to another, by a
Third person, without any injury to him who had the sole Right.

After this follows a Council at Rome under Melchiades, wherein the Pope, by
delegation from the Emperor, is joined in Commission with Three French Bishops,
(who are called his Colleagues) to hear the Donatists complaint against Cecilian
Bishop of Carthage Lab. p. 1401. Bin. page 212. col. 1.
, and Constantine not only received the Donatists first Appeal, and delegated
this Cause to Melchiades and his Fellow Commissioners; but upon a second
Complaint, ordered this Matter to be heard over again in a French Council,
which the Pope in Council had determined. Now this so clearly shows, that the
Pope was not Supreme Judge in those days, that Baronius and Binius are hard put
to it, to Blunder this Instance: The Notes say, Constantine was yet raw in the
Faith; and yet they say also, He knew by God's Law, nothing was to be done
without the chief Bishop. But they are forced to prove this by a false
Translation of Constantine's Epistle to Melchiades Lab. p. 1407. Bin. page 212.
col. 2.
, the words of which in Greek are, (...), which in their Version is, As the
most holy Law of God requires; but Valesius's Translation (which Labbe gives
us) is, As is agreeable to the most Venerable Law; That is, (as all men know)
to the Imperial Laws: So that Constantine only says, He had ordered the
Accusers and Accused, all to appear at Rome before these delegated Judges, as
the Venerable Laws (which order both Parties to be present when a Cause is
tried) do require; and by the help of a false Translation this occasion is made
use of, to make the Credulous believe, That God's Law required all Causes
should be tried at Rome: Whereas it is apparent by this Instance, That a Cause
once Tried there before the Pope, might be tried over again in France, if the
Emperor pleased.

The two following Epistles of Constantine out of Pithaeus his Manuscript Lab.
p. 1430. Bin. page 213.
, are very suspicious; the first speaks more magnificently of Christ than one
who (as they say) was so raw in the Faith was like to do: And in it Constantine
is made to decline Judging in Bishops Causes; which is a protestation against
his own Act, and a contradiction to the second Epistle, wherein He declares,
that this Episcopal Cause shall be tried before himself: Nor is this first
Epistle Recorded in Eusebius, or agreeable to Constantine's Style; so that we
suppose, that was devised by such as designed to persuade Princes, That Bishops
were above them: For which purpose Baronius here cites a Law of this Emperor to
Ablavius Baron. An. 314.. 38, 39.
, Giving men leave to choose Bishops for their Judges, and not allowing them
after that to appeal to Secular Courts; because they had been heard by Judges
of their own choosing: But Baronius perverts this, to signify, That Bishops
were above Secular Judges by their ordinary Jurisdiction, whereas they were not
so in any Cause of this kind, but only when they were extraordinarily chosen
Arbitrators; and so Sozomen expounds this Law.

An. Dom. 314.
. 6. We are now arrived at the time of Pope Sylvester, who living about the
time when Constantine publicly professed Christianity, and being Pope when the
Nicene Council was called; yet no Author of Credit, records his being much
concerned in these grand Revolutions: Upon which the Annalist, and our Editors
rake into all kind of Forgeries, and devise most improbable Stories, to set off
Pope Sylvester as very considerable; but we shall look into the Original of the
Emperor's becoming a Christian, which will discover all their Fallacies.

Constantine was born of Christian Parents, and brought up under them, and was
Thirty years old when he entered on the Empire: And from the Year 306 Baron. An.
306.. 14.
He professed openly he was a Christian, Making Laws to encourage Converts, and
to suppress Paganism throughout his Empire, Building and Endowing Churches, and
granting great Immunities to the Clergy; yet all this while He took no notice
of Marcellus, Eusebius, or Melchiades, S. Peter's Successors, and pretended
Monarchs of the Church. After Seven years having Vanquished Maxentius at Rome,
they say, He gave to the Pope his Palace of the Lateran Lab. p. 1394. Bin. page
209. col. 1. Baron. An. 312.. 82, and. 85.
: The Notes cite Optatus for this; but he only says, A Council of Nineteen
Bishops met in the Lateran; but it does not follow from thence, that
Constantine had then given the Pope this fair Palace. Again, Baronius (without
any ancient Author for it) says, That Constantive gave S. Peter thanks for his
Victory over Maxentius; yet at the same time he affirms, He was yet a Pagan,
and durst not by his Acts declare himself a Christian Baron. An. 312.. 58, and.
62.
. Very strange! Were not Building Churches, settling Christianity by a Law,
giving his Palace to the Pope, and (as they say) Fixing the Trophy of the Cross
in the midst of Rome Bin. p. 208 col. 2.
, Acts sufficient to declare him a Christian? No, He must be a Pagan Eleven
years after this, and a Persecutor; yea, in the year 324 He was so mere a
Heathen as to know nothing of the Christian Rites, but what an Egyptian taught
him. After he had openly professed this Religion Eighteen years, He had forgot
it all, and turned so great a Tyrant, that Pope Sylvester (who had no great
mind to be a Martyr) ran away into the Mount Soracte, or was banished thither:
But Constantine, after He had been Ten years Pope, never had heard of him, till
being struck with a Leprosy (mentioned in no Authentic Writer) two glorious
Persons, whose Faces he knew not, appeared to the Emperor, and ordered him to
send for Pope Sylvester to cure him; who (when He was come) first showed
Constantine these two glorious Persons were S. Peter and S. Paul, and then
Cured him; made him a Christian, and Baptized him. Which idle and
self-contradicting Romance is magnified by Baronius's and Binius's Notes; but
we will now confute it as briefly as we can.

. 7. First, This whole Story is devised, to exalt the Glory of the Roman
Church; to make Men believe the Pope could work Miracles, and that the first
Christian Emperor was Baptized at Rome: But then it casts such a blot upon
Constantine's Memory, and feigns such odious and incredible things of him, as
no wise Man can believe concerning a Prince, who S. Augustine says, was a
Christian Eight years before this Baron. An. 316.. 59, and 62, 63.
. And whoever reads in Baronius, the History of the first Ten years of
Sylvester, from An. 314 till An. 324, and observes what glorious Things he
says of Constantine's Religious Laws, his Piety to God, his Zeal for
Christianity, his Respect to Confessors, and his Bounty to Bishops; his taking
part with the Catholics against Heretics and Schismatics: He can never believe
this scandalous Story of so excellent a Prince. But in all this Period of Time,
Baronius himself cannot find one Evidence, That ever Constantine had any
correspondence with Sylvester, and therefore Christianity was settled in the
Empire without the Pope's help: To cover which great Truth, some dull (but
zealous Monk) long since invented this Sham Story, to save the Credit of Rome;
and the Annalist and these Notes strive to defend it.

Secondly, This Fable chiefly relies on the Credit of the Pontifical, (so often
proved false) and upon the repute of Sylvester's Acts: But the Annotator at
first ominously Charges them both with Falsehood Lab. p. 1416. Bin. page 217.
col. 1.
; the former mistakes the Time of the Vacancy, and the latter (he says) is
wrong in making Melchiades ordain Sylvester a Priest, he being Ordained by
Marcellinus long before. Baronius also confesses, That these Acts of Sylvester
are so false in many particulars, that it shakes the Credit of the whole Baron.
Annal. 311.. 59. and An. 315.. 10, 11, and 12. and An. 324.. 41.
. But it is very strange, after he (who is so concerned for their Reputation)
had found so many Flaws in them, he should justify them even where they
contradict all the Historians of the Age; which can spring from nothing but a
Resolution to maintain every thing which made for the Credit of the Roman See.

Thirdly, The Notes say not only the Acts of Sylvester, but Zosimus and Sozomen
do both attest this Story: Now first, Zosimus was a Pagan, and Baronius and
Binius confess, He tells many Malicious Lies of Constantine, for suppressing
the Heathen Religion; and though they confute the rest of his Calumnies, they
defend his Relation of Constantine's Baptism, as sounding something like those
forged Acts Baron. An. 324.. 17.
; and though his Account of it reflect as much upon Constantine, as is
possible; yet the Annalist and Annotator labor to prove this Spightful Heathen
to be a truer Historian, than Sozomen, Socrates, or Eusebius, whom they
represent as Liars and Flatterers, not to be believed against Zosimus. Yet
there is a mighty difference between this Pagan's History of the Baptism of
Constantine, and that in Sylvester's Acts: Zosimus says, It was a Spaniard,
named Aegyptius, lately by the Court Ladies brought acquainted with
Constantine, who advised him to be Baptized; and this the Notes say was Hosius;
yet it is plain, Hosius was Constantine's Intimate Friend, and his Legate into
Egypt Twelve years before (z). Besides, Baron An. 312.. 91.
Zosimus does not name Sylvester, and only designed by his Relation to blacken
Constantine, and represent Christianity as a Sanctuary for Villainies, which
could not be expiated among the Pagans: But the Acts discourse of a
Persecution, and a Leprosy, and make Peter and Paul the Advisers of
Constantine's Baptism; and their business is only to set up Sylvester's Name.
And the Stories (like all Falsehoods) do not hang together: As for Sozomen, he
is no Evidence for Sylvester's Acts, nor does he once name that Pope in the
place cited Sozom. hist lib. 1. cap. 5.
. He only confutes the scandalous Stories, which Zosimus had falsely told of
Constantine, showing how improbable it is, that this Emperor (after he had
Reigned nigh Twenty years) should need a New Conversion; and how unlikely it
must be, that the Pagans would not have found out some Rites to expiate him,
that so they might secure him in their Religion: So that he is a Witness, That
these Reports of Constantine were false, and invented by Malicious Heathens,
and so far as Zosimus and Sylvester's Acts agree, he confutes them both; and
since he lived within an Hundred years after this time, while some alive might
possibly remember these Passages; His early denial of these Fictions is better
Evidence against them, than Baronius and Binius's Testimony for them, after
Thirteen hundred years; to serve a Turn, and do Honor to that Church they
resolve to Magnify.

Fourthly, The Notes speak of Sylvester's Returning to Rome in great glory;
which is not mentioned in Zosimus nor Sozomen, and only relies on the Credit of
these Acts Lab. p. 1417. Bin. page 217.
: Which have no Evidence to Attest them, but Pope Adrian, who perhaps forged
them; or however, first produced these Acts in the Second Nicene Council, Four
hundred and Fifty years after Sylvester's time, to prove the use of Images in
Constantine's Days. But the very Acts declare, That Constantine (who had Built
and Adorned so many Churches, and if Images or Pictures had then been used,
must have seen the Faces of S. Peter and S. Paul) did not know the Faces of
these two great Apostles, till Sylvester showed them their Images. Whence we
infer, That the Acts are no good Proof for Images, if they were Authentic; and
their being first cited in an Ignorant Council, made up of Forgeries and False
Stories, gives us good Reason to believe them Spurious.

. 8. The Annotator in the next place asserts confidently, That Constantine was
Baptized at Rome by Sylvester, Anno 324 Lab. p. 1417. Bin. page 217. col. 2.
: But his Proofs are very weak, viz. First, He cites a Roman Council for this,
held the same year: But the Style of that Council is so barbarous, the
Sentences so incoherent, and the Matter of Fact so false, that Labbe owns it is
a Forgery, and Binius confesses it is suspicious Lab. p. 1544. Bin. page 256.
; so that this can be no evidence: Nor Secondly, Anastasius Bibliothecarius,
who lived Five hundred and Fifty years after this time, and was a mere
Sycophant of the Popes, to set up whose Supremacy (then newly hatched) he stuck
at nothing, and that spoils his Credit. Thirdly, Zosimus is a malicious Lying
Writer, as to Constantine; and though he do say, Constantine was Baptized at
Rome, he does not affirm, that Sylvester Baptized him: Fourthly, Sozomen only
relates Zosimus his Story to confute it; so that not one of his Witnesses do
prove the matter: Yet these Authors with a weak Conjecture, That Constantine
could not have been present in the Nicene Council, if he had not been Baptized
before (which we will presently confute) is all the Evidence that Baronius and
these Notes can give for this incredible Story: But on the other side, there
are many clear Proofs, that he was baptized at Nicomedia, a little before his
death.

First, Eusebius (who lived at that time, and knew Constantine very well, and
writ his History soon after) does affirm this: And if it had been False, many
then alive who could remember it, would doubtless have exposed him for so
manifest a Fiction. The Notes say he Forged this Story in favor of
Constantius; but he must be very Ridiculous, if he would be obliged by a Story
of his Father, which many hundreds as well as himself, must have then known to
be a Falsehood; And Eusebius must be as silly as he was knavish, to invent a
Fable so easy to be disproved by living Witnesses: But the Notes wrong
Eusebius, when they say, he reports that Constantine died Impious and alienated
from the Catholic Church; For Eusebius says he made a most Christian and Pious
end: However Eusebius by this Testimony brings upon himself, all the Rage and
Spite of Baronius and our Annotator, who upon all occasions Blast this Holy and
Learned Writer, to whose pains they and all the Christian World are infinitely
beholding; and though while Eusebius's History continues, it be almost the only
true Record used by Baronius in compiling his Annals; yet he and Binius in
every Page almost do revile him as an Arian and a Writer of Lies: But there is
so much Malice, and so little probability in the Accusation, that their own
Writers and ours also do vindicate Eusebius from these Slanders Valesij. praes.
ad edit. Eusebius. Dr. Cave life of Eusebius. page 31.
, and we could easily confute these Calumnies, but only that in this Relation
he is so certainly in the Right, that we need not consider his Opinion in other
things, but will show as to this particular he is supported by the best
Evidence imaginable. For

Secondly, Theodoret also says, that Constantine was Baptized a little before
his Death at Nicomedia Theodoret. hist. lib. 1. cap. 32
; and though that Eusebius, who was Bishop of that City, was an Arian, yet he
dissembled his Heresy while Constantine lived, and the Emperor had restored
Athanasius, contrary to this Bishop's mind; wherefore though he was forced to
make use of an Arian Bishop to Baptize him, being taken ill in that City, yet
it will not follow that Constantine died an Arian: Moreover that Constantine
was Baptized at Nicomedia, is attested also by Socrates Socrat. hist. lib. 1.
cap. 26.
and Sozomen Sozom. lib. 2. cap. 32.
; and also by the Chronicles of Isidore and S. Hierom Baron. An. 324.. 47.
, and by S. Ambrose in his Funeral Oration for Theodosius; Yea, Athanasius and
a whole Synod at Ariminum, do expressly declare, that Constantine was Baptized a
little before his Death; that is, Thirteen years after this pretended Baptism
at Rome Athanas de Synod. page 243. Epistol. Synod. Arim. ap. Socrat. lib. 2.
cap. 29. and Sozom. lib. 4. cap. 17.
, which last Testimony Baronius and the Notes presume to corrupt, and contrary
to all the best Copies, and the necessary Sense of the place, put Constans his
Name into the Text instead of Constantine: So that in fine the only Question is
now, Whether we will believe these two Modern partial Writers, with those most
Fabulous (but as they call them most approved) Acts of Sylvester, first cited
by Pope Adrian 450 years after: Or we will believe the concurrent Witness of
all the Ancient and Eminent Writers of that and the next Ages; to whom if we
give Credit, then Constanstine's Baptism at Rome by Sylvester, is a mere
Forgery devised for the glory of the Roman Church, and for that only reason so
eagerly defended by this Annotator and the Annalist.

. 9. Together with this Fable we must also reject the Fiction of Constantine's
Leprosy, which was invented only that Sylvester might cure it Lab. p. 1419.
Bin. page 218. col. 2.
; and therefore the Notes prove it very slenderly, viz. First, By those Acts of
Sylvester, in which they confess there are many Errors Vid. ibid. and Baron.
Annal. 324.. 97.
: Secondly, By a Roman Council, which is as manifest a Forgery as the Acts
themselves: Thirdly, By a Metaphorical expression of Gregorius Turenensis, a
credulous Writer, who lived 300 years after this, and yet even he does not
expressly affirm it. Fourthly, But the Annotator tells us the Gentile Historians
do confirm this, though he names but one, viz. Michael Glycas, who unlucklily
proves a Christian Monk, living in Sicily, Anno 1120, about 800 years after
this time, and long after Adrian and his Nicene Council had dispersed
Sylvester's Acts, out of which Glycas took this Fable upon Trust: So that at
last he only proves the Acts, by the Acts themselves and by Pope Adrian; and
that is all the Authority he has for this feigned Leprosy, which Disease no
Writer (of Credit and Antiquity) says Constantine, ever had; no not that
Malicious Zosimus, who raked up all the Odious things against this Emperor he
could devise; and if ever he had been struck by Heaven with Leprosy, no doubt
he would have Blazed it abroad with great Pleasure.

. 10. The Book of Constantine's Munificence, is grounded on the Fable of his
Baptism, and seems to be Forged by the same Hand with Sylvester's Acts: So that
we ought also to reject it as a Fiction: Anastasius, who put it out, was the
Pope 's Library Keeper; and whether he made it, or found it in the Vatican,
that Shop of Lies (as Richerius calls it) the Credit of it is invalidated, by
reason, no Author of Repute or Antiquity, mentions any of these Gifts: It says
blasphemously, Constantine gave a Savior sitting five foot high (so it calls a
dead Image Lab. p. 1420. Bin. Not page 219. col. 1.
;) But if this were true, why did not Adrian cite this in his Nicene Council?
Or why did this Emperor 's Sister write to Eusebius Bishop of Coesarea for an
Image of Christ, when Sylvester could more easily have furnished her? and by
the way, the Notes fraudulently mention this Message Not. Y. Bin. page 219.
col. 2. and Lab. p. 1421.
, but do not relate how severely Eusebius reproved that Lady for seeking after
a visible Image of Christ: The Annotator also cites Paulinus to prove this Book
of Munificence; but he writ near 100 years after; and though he speak of a fine
Church of S. Peter in Rome; yet he says not that Constantine either founded or
adorned it: Baronius attempts to prove this Book by mear Conjectures, by the
Forged Acts, and by Nicephorus, a late Author, whom he often taxes for Fictions
Baron. An. 324.. 72. and 75.
; but he can produce no ancient or eminent Author for it: And yet it is
certain, if Constantine, had given so many and so great gifts to the Head City
of the World, some of the most Famous Writers would have Recorded it: Besides,
the Cardinal himself rejects both the idle Story of S. Agnes Temple, (attested
by a Fiction ascribed to S. Ambrose) told in this very Book Baron. An. 324..
107.
; and the apparent Falsehood of Constantine's now burying his Mother in one of
these Churches, who was alive long after Idem, An. 324.. 114.
: So that by his own Confession there are diverse Falsehoods in this Book; and he
had been more Ingenuous if he had owned the whole to be (as it really is) a
Forgery.

An. Dom. 314.
. 11. The Editors now go back to the Council of Arles, held (as they say) Anno
314 Lab. p. 1425. Bin. page 220. col. 1.
: And it troubles them much, to ward off the Blows which it gives to their
beloved Supremacy: For it was appointed by the Emperor, upon an Appeal made to
him by the Donatists, to judge a cause over again, which had been judged before
by Melchiades and his Roman Council; (the Pope in Council it seems, being not
then taken to be Infallible:) It Is true, in the Title, which these Editors give
us, this Council directs their Canons, To their Lord and most Holy Brother
Sylvester the Bishop, and say, they had sent them to him, that all might know
(the Pope not excepted) what they were to observe: So that though in Respect
they call him Lord, yet they Style him also a Brother, and expect his obedience
to their Decrees; nor do they (as the Notes pretend,) desire him to confirm
these Canons Lab. p. 1434. Bin. page 223. col. 2.
; But only require the Pope who held the larger Diocese, that he would openly
acquaint all with them, as their Letter speaks: That is, as he was a
Metropolitan, to give notice of these Canons to all his Province, which was
then called a Diocese; and Baronius is forced to point the Sentence falsely to
make it sound, toward his beloved Supremacy Baron An. 314.. 68.
. So in the First Canon, Pope Sylvester is ordered by this Council to give
notice to all, of the Day on which Easter was to be observed: That is, he was
to write to all his Neighboring Bishops under his Jurisdiction about it, not
as the Notes say Lab. p. 1434. Bin. page 224. col. 1. Baron An. 314.. 58.
; That he was to determine the day, and by virtue of his Office to write to all
the Bishops of the Christian World to observe it: The Council had ordered the
Day, and command the Pope to give notice to all about him to keep it: And in
the Famous Nicene Council, The Bishop of Alexandria (living where Astronomy was
well understood) was appointed first to settle, and then to certify the day of
Easter; yet none will infer from hence, that he was the Head of the Catholic
Church, because he had this Duty imposed on him, which as yet, is more than the
Council of Arles did put upon the Bishop of Rome. Again, the Notes are very
angry at the Emperor, for receiving the Donatists appeal from the Pope and his
Council, which they say Constantine owned to be an unjust and impious thing Not
in Council Aret. Bin. page 221. col. 2.
; but they prove this only by a forged Epistle mentioned but now, 5. But it is
certain Constantine, (though a Catechumen, which they pretended was impossible
at Nice) was present in this Council, and so he must act against his
Conscience, if he had thought it unjust, and impious to judge in Ecclesiastical
Causes: And in this Emperor 's Letter to Ablavius, he says; God had committed
all Earthly things to his ordering: and in that to Celsus he promises to come
into Africa, to enquire and judge of things done both by the People and the
Clergy Baron. Ann. 316.. 62.
. And indeed Constantine, by all his practice sufficiently declared, he thought
it lawful enough for him to judge in Ecclesiastical matters. Finally, the Notes
say the Bishops met in this Council, at the Emperor 's request Lab. p. 1423
Bin. page 222. col. 2.
; Now that shows it was not at the Pope 's request; but indeed Constantine's
Letter to Chrestus, expressly Commands the Bishops to meet; The Notes also out
of Balduinus or Optatus, (or rather from an obscure Fragment cited by him) say,
Sylvester was President of this Council; Baronius adds of his own head --
namely by his Legates Baron. Ann. 314.. 51.
, which guess Binius puts down for a certain truth: But it is ridiculous to
fancy that a pair of Priests, and as many Deacons in that Age, should sit above
the Emperor, when himself was present in that Council; So that though we allow
the Pope 's Messengers to have been at this Council, there is no proof that
they presided in it: We shall only add, that instead of Arians in the Eighth
Canon, we must Read Africans: or else we must not fix this Council so early as
An. 314, at which time the Arians were not known by that name.

. 12. In the same year is placed the Council of Ancyra, which the Editors do
not (as usually) say was under Sylvester, but only in his time Lab. p. 1455.
Bin. page 225.
; and it is well they are so modest; for doubtless he had no Hand in it; the
Notes confess that it was called by the Authority of Vitalis Bishop of Antioch
Lab. p. 1478. Bin. page 232. col. 2.
: Balsamon and Zonaras say Vitalis of Antioch, Agricolaus of Caesarea, and
Basil of Amasea, were the Presidents of it Beveridg. Council Tom. I. page 375.
. Yet not only Leo the Fourth, but the famous Council of Nice, approved of this
Synod called and carried on without the Pope 's knowledge or leave: There is
but one Canon in this Council which contradicts the Roman practice, viz. The
Ninth, which allows Deacons to Marry and continue in their Office, if they
declared at their Ordination that they could not live Single: This Canon
therefore Baronius and Binius strive to corrupt with false Glosses: The former
says, We may by this Canon see how firmly Ministers single Life was asserted,
not only in the whole Catholic Church but in the East Baron. Ann. 314.. 88.
. Now it is very strange, that a private Canon of a Provincial Council, which
allows one Order of Ministers to Marry, should show it was the Opinion of the
whole Church, that none might Marry: The latter in his Notes affirms That, this
among other Canons solidly proves, that not only Priests, but Deacons. (by the
Apostolical Law) were bound to Live without Wives Lab. p. 1478. Bin. page 223.
col. 2.
: But the Apostles certainly allowed Deacons to have Wives; and this Canon was
made on purpose, that they might live with their Wives, if they pleased: The
Notes proceed to say, That Deacons ordained against their Will, and pr testing
they could not contain, were by these Fathers permitted to Marry after their
Ordination, provided they left off all Sacred Administrations, and did not
Communicate among the Priests in the Chancel, but among the People: Which is an
impudent falsification; There being no word of being Ordained unwillingly; nor
any reason why they should be Ordained, who were to be reduced presently to
Lay-communion: Yea, the Words of the Canon are express, that if they did Marry,
they should continue in their Ministration (...). Vid Dever. not. Tom. II. p.
175.
; So that these Editors make no Conscience, to make these ancient Records to
contradict themselves, rather then let them seem to oppose their Churches
present practice: For which vile purpose there is another trick in the Notes on
this Council; For whereas the Eighteenth Canon speaks of Lay-persons which
Vowed single Life, (as many had done in times of Persecution) and afterward
broke their Vow, that these were to be counted Bigamists; The Notes Bin. p.
233. col. 2.
on this Canon, put these Words of the Thirteenth Canon, Those who are of the
Clergy, etc. Before their observation on the Eighteenth Canon, on purpose to
make the Reader think the Clergy in those days, Vowed single Life as they do
now at Rome.

. 13. The Council of Naeccaesarea (according to these Editors) was under
Sylvester Lab. p. 1479. Bin. page 233.
, who is not once named in it, nor does it appear he knew of it: They might
also have left out Leo the Fourth's approving it Five hundred years after,
because the Notes say, The Council of Nice allowed it, which is much more for
its Credit Lab. p. 1489. Bin. page 236. col. 2.
. The same Notes say, The first Canon orders the same thing, which was decreed
in the Thirty third Canon at Elliberis, and the Ninth at Ancyra: And if so,
that is not, (as they falsely gloss the Canon of Ancyra) That the Clergy should
live Single, or be reduced to Lay-Communion: For in that Canon some of the
Clergy are allowed to Marry, and to continue to minister as Clergymen still.
And the true Sense of this Naeocaesarean Canon is, That whereas in times of
Persecution, when Marriage was inconvenient, many Priests promised to live
Single: Now these only were not allowed to Marry afterward Vid. Beveridg. Not.
in Council. Nicen. Tom. II. p. 180.
; but when the Church had Peace, the Nicene Council left all Clergymen free,
to Marry or not, as they pleased; which shows, That when the Reason of this
Canon ceased, they believed its Obligation did so also. The Fifth Canon forbids
a Catechumen, who falls into Sin, to enter into the Church: By which the Notes
say, That Baronius had sharply censured Eusebius Vid. Baron. An. 324.. 49.
: But it is plain, that Baronius shows more Malice than Wit in that Censure:
Eusebius only relates Matter of Fact, That Constantine was present in the
Nicene Council, and he (with all ancient Authors) agrees, That Constantine was
yet a Catechumen; where then is the Crime? Do not Baronius and Binius both
agree, that Constantine was present in the Council of Arles, Ten years before
his pretended Baptism at Rome? And if it be said, This Canon forbid it: I ask,
Whether it be probable, that an Emperor (who, as Baronius says, was Solutus
Legibus, Above the Civil Law) should be proceeded against by a Canon of a small
Provincial Council? Wherefore Eusebius his only Crime is, That he tells a
Truth, which happens to contradict the Lying Acts of Sylvester, and
consequently the Interest of Rome, for which the Cardinal and Annotator can
never forgive him.

The next place is assigned to a Roman Council, under Sylvester, wherein there
was a famous Disputation between the Jews and Christians, before Constantine
and Helena; but in the Notes Lab. p. 1491. Bin. page 237. col. 1. Vid. Baron.
An. 315.. 12.
we are told the Story is utterly false, only attested by Sylvester's Acts,
which Swarm with Lies, as they are now extant; (yet out of these Acts, as now
extant, is the Forgery of Constantine's Baptism at Rome taken;) and therefore
Baronius and Binius reject this Council as a mere Forgery. But why do they not
reject Constantine's Baptism, as well as this Council, since both rely on the
same Author? The Reason is plain, That makes for the Interest of the Pope, and
This no way concerns; and so it may pass for a Forgery, as it is.

. 14. On occasion of Arius's Heresy now breaking out at Alexandria, An. Dom.
315.
there was a Council of an Hundred Bishops called by Alexander, Bishop of that
City, to Condemn him; which first Council of Alexandria (the Editors say) was
under Sylvester; but it does not appear that this Pope knew of it till Three
years after Lab. p. 1492. Bin. page 237. col. 2.
, An. 318; at which time Alexander gave notice of this Council (not to
Sylvester by name, as the Notes falsely suggest, but) to all Catholic Bishops,
and in particular to the Bishop of Constantinople. But for fear the Reader
should observe, That more respect was showed to that Bishop, than to the Pope,
the Editors have removed these Epistles of Alexander into the Body of the
Nicene Council, and only give us Notes upon them here, in which the Annotator
out of Baronius turns the Charge of Lying and Forgery, of which themselves have
been so often convicted, upon us, whom they falsely call Innovators Baron.
Annal. 318.. 18. Bin. page 239. col. 1.
. Four years after followed a Second Council at Alexandria, which the Notes
hope to prove was under Sylvester Lab. p. 1493. Bin. page 239. col. 1.
, because Athanasius says, This was a General Council, and says, Hosius was
there: Upon this Baronius, fancying nothing could be a General Council unless
the Pope were present Personally or by his Legates, conjectures Hosius was the
Pope's Legate, and in that capacity presided in this Council Baron. An. 318..
22. etc.
: And the Notes positively affirm this Dream for a certain Truth. But
Athanasius calls many Synods General, which were only Provincial; and it is
plain, he had not the modern Roman Notion of a General Council, because he
never mentions Sylvester, nor does he say, Hosius was his Legate. But even
Baronius owns, that Hosius was Constantine's intimate Friend, and his Legate
into Egypt six years before Baron. An. 312.. 91, and 92.
; and Socrates says, He was now again sent thither as the Emperor's Legate;
and no doubt, if he did preside in this Council, it was not as Sylvester's
Legate (whom no ancient Author records, to have had any hand in this Council,)
but as the Legate of Constantine. After these two Councils is placed a Letter
of this Emperors to Alexander and Arius, taken out of Eusebius, but is
misplaced by the Editors; since it is plain, it was written in the beginning of
the Controversy about Arius, and not only before Constantine understood any
thing of the matter, but before these Councils at Alexandria: But Baronius and
the Editors place it here Bin. Not. p. 240. col. 2. and Baron. An. 318.. 91.
on purpose to Rail at Eusebius, as if he put out an Arian Forgery; whereas it
is a great Truth, and Constantine may well be supposed to write thus, before he
was rightly informed in the Case; therefore those Gentlemen do not hurt
Eusebius's Reputation, but their own, in accusing him so falsely, upon the old
Grudge of his not attesting their Forgeries, devised and defended for the
Honor of the Roman Church.

. 15. The Council of Laodicea (though it do not appear any Pope knew of it till
after it was Risen) they resolve shall be held under some Pope; the Title
says, Under Sylvester Lab. p. 1495. Bin. page 241.
; Labbe's Margen says, Under Liberius, An. 364, or 357; or, Under Damasus 367:
Whereas in truth it was under no Pope, and being placed in the old Collections
of Canons after those of Antioch, and also mentioning the Photinians, it must
be held long after the Nicene Council Beveridg. not. Tom. II. page 193.
: But it was falsely placed before the Nicene Council by Baronius (our Editor's
main Guide) to secure the Book of Judith by the Council of Nice's Authority
Richer. hist. Conc. lib. 1. cap. 3. page 128.
. And the Reasons given for this early placing it are very frivolous: For
first, The softening of a Canon of Naeocaesarea is no certain Mark of time.
Secondly, This Council rejects Judith out of the Canon of Scripture, and so did
the Council of Nice also; for though S. Hierom, when he had told us, This Book
is not of Authority sufficient to determine Controversies; adds, That the
Nicene Synod is read, to have computed it among Holy Writings Hieron. Ep. CXI.
Tom. III. p. 34.
. S. Hierom only means, They allowed it to be Read for Instruction, but did not
count it Canonical; for doubtless he would not have rejected Judith, if that
Council had received it into the Canon. And he says elsewhere, The Church
indeed reads Judith, Tobit, and the Macchabees, but receives them not among
Canonical Scriptures Id. Ep. 115. ibid. p. 39.
; and again, A man may receive this Book as he pleases Idem Ep. 10. Tom. I.
page 96.
. Herein therefore the Council of Lacdicea does not contradict the Council of
Nice at all, as these Notes falsely pretend. Thirdly, This Counc ls decreeing
the same things which were decreed at Nice, without naming it, is no Argument
it was held before that of Nice; nothing being more ordinary, than for later
Councils to renew older Canons without citing the former Councils for them.

The Notes on the Second Canon at Laodicea (which supposes Penitents, to make
their Confession by Prayer to God, and mentions no Priest) would willingly
graft the use of their modern Sacramental Confession, to a Priest, upon this
ancient Canon Lab. p. 1523. Bin page 248. col. 2.
; but it rather confutes, than countenances that modern device. Their laboring
to expunge the Photinians out of the Seventh Canon, since all the old Greek
Copies have these words Beveridg. Not. Tom. II. p. 193.
, is merely to justify their false Date of this Council. The Annotator on the
Fifteenth Canon confesses, that S. Paul Commands all the People to join in the
Hymns, and that this Use continued to S. Hierom 's time; yet he owns their
pretended Apostolical Church has altered this Primitive Custom grounded on
Holy Scripture; and that for very frivolous Reasons Lab. p. 1524. Bin. page
249. col. 1.
. But let it be observed, That this Canon forbids not the People to bear a part
in the Church Service; but allows them not to begin, or bring in any Hymns into
the Public Service. The Seventeenth Canon speaks of the Assemblies of the
Faithful in two Latin Versions, and the Greek is (...); yet because the worst
Latin Translation reads, in Processionibus; the Notes impertinently run out
into a discourse of their Superstitious modern Processions; for any thing
serves them for an occasion, to make their late Devices seem ancienter than
they are Lab. and Bin. ibid.
. The Thirty fourth Canon mentions and censures those, who leaving the Martyrs
of Christ, go to false Martyrs; And the Fifty first Canon mentions the Martyrs
Feasts: Upon which the Notes Lab. p. 1526. Bin. page 250. col. 1.
most falsely infer, That the Martyrs were then adored with Religious Worship:
But this is only his Invention. The Canon speaks not one word of Worshipping
Martyrs; but only, whereas the Orthodox Christian Assemblies were generally in
the Burial-places of true Martyrs, where they offered up Prayers to God: Some
it seems began to make separate Meetings in Places dedicated to False Martyrs,
and therefore the properest Note here would have been, to have set out the Sin
of Schism, and the Pious Fraud (as they call it) of feigning false Martyrs, of
which their Church is highly guilty. The Thirty fifth Canon expressly forbids
leaving the Church of God, and calling upon Angels; which they say is an hidden
kind of Idolatry, and forsaking Christ the Son of God, to go after Idolatry.
And Theodoret, who lived soon after the true time of this Council, says, Those
who were for Moses 's Law, which was given by Angels, brought in the Worship of
them; which Error reigned long in Phrygia and Pisidia; and therefore the
Council of Laodicea, in Phrygia, did by a Law forbid the Praying to Angels
Theodoret. in Coloss. cap. 2.
. Which Canon does so evidently condemn the Roman Churches Prayers to the
Angels as Idolatry, that the former Editors of the Councils impudently
corrupted the Text of this Canon, and put in Angulos, for Angelos Edit.
Merlini, Pet. Crab. and Barth. Caranz.
, as if the Council had only forbid Praying in private Corners; whereas not
only the Greek, but the oldest Latin Copies, and Theodoret, have Angels: But
our Editors and Annotator having Baronius for their Guide, venture to keep the
true Reading [Angels] in the Text, and put [Angles] into the Margen, hoping by
false Notes to ward off this severe Blow Lab. p. 1526. Bin. page 250. col. 1.
. And first, The Notes dare not produce the place of Theodoret at large; then
they strive to blunder the Reader with a distinction of Dulia and Latria, which
can signify nothing here, because the Canon and Theodoret both say, It is
Praying to Angels which is forbid; and that the Romanists certainly do. Again,
Baronius censures Theodoret for saying, That such Heretics as were for Moses 's
Law, brought in ANGEL-Worship: But why does he not censure S. Paul, who says,
That those who were Jewishly inclined, and observed differences of Meats,
New Mons and Sabbaths, were the Inventers of Angel-Worship Coloss. II. ver.
16, 17, 18.
? The Angelic-Heretics in Epiphanius and S. Augustine, who came in afterward,
did not (as the Notes represent them) say, That Angels were to be worshipped
with the Worship due to God alone: Only as the Romanists now are, so they were
inclined to Worship Angels Aug. de haeres. Tom. VI. page 4 m.
; that is, by Praying to them. However, we Protestants say with Theodoret, We
neither give them Divine Worship, nor divide the Service due to the Divine
Majesty, between them and the true God Theod. de Curand. Graec. Off. Sermon. 3.
: And when the Romanists can say this honestly, and leave off Praying to them,
we will not tax them with this Canon. Baronius has one Device more, viz. That
the Angels, which this Council says, must not be Worshipped, were not good
Angels, but Devils and the Genii, adored by the Pagans; For (says he) the
former Canon receives the Worship of the true Martyrs, and rejects that of
false Martyrs. To which I Answer, first, It is false (as was showed) that the
former Canon receives the Worship of any Martyrs, true or false. Secondly, Why
does not this Canon call these Pseudo-Angels, as the former called those it
rejected, Pseudo-Martyrs, if the Prohibitions were of the same kind? Did ever
any Christian call Devils, Angels, without some addition; as Evil Angels,
Apostate Angels, etc? Besides, in that Age when this Council was held
(according to Baronius) the worship of Demons and the Tutelar Spirits, was
public, not secret Idolatry; so that it is manifest, this Canon speaks not to
Pagans, but Heretical Christians. And Theodoret shows, That it was those
Angels, who gave the Law of Moses, which were hereby forbid to be Prayed to;
and I hope neither Binius, nor his Master, will say, these were Devils:
Wherefore this Canon plainly says, Praying to good Angels, (as They of Rome
now do) is Idolatry.

To conclude, The Sixtieth Canon of this Council, is the most ancient Account
of the Canon of Scripture, that ever was made by any Christian Synod, being the
same which the Church of England holds at this day; for it leaves out all those
Books of Judith, Tobit, Wisdom, etc. which we account not to be Canonical; but
our Annotator finding so Primitive a Council contradicting their new Trent
Canon, and not being able to reconcile the difference, passes this remarkable
Canon by, without any Note.

. 16. The reproachful Obscurity of Sylvester in this time of Action, in all
other Christian Churches, puts the Editors upon giving us an heap of Forgeries
together, to color over the Pope's doing nothing Remarkable for Nine or Ten
years: First, We have an Epistle of the Primitive Church, and Constantine's
Munificence Lab. p. 1528. Bin. page 250. col. 2.
: But Gratian, and the former Editors of Councils, cited this as a Decretal
Epistle of Melchiades, to prove the Pope's Supremacy, etc. whereas the Forgery
is so gross, that our Annotator affirms it to be a Fiction of Isidore
Mercator's, patched up of Fragments stolen out of the History of the Nicene
Council, the Council of Chalcedon, and S. Gregory's 24th Epistle, and woefully
Mis-timed Lab. p. 1530. Bin. page 251. col. 2.
: Yet being used to cite such Forgeries, (after this Confession) he will not
let it go without making some use of it; for he Notes, that what is said here
of Constantine 's Donations to Melchiades and Sylvester, is very true, and may
be firmly proved by Optatus Milevitanus. Very strange! Optatus mentions no
Donation of Constantine to either of these Popes, Vid. supr.. 6. and therefore
the Reader may note, That false and weak Inferences or Quotations from manifest
Forgeries, are Firm Proofs with Baronius and Binius, when they make for the
Roman Interest; but the best Canons of the most genuine Councils are of no
value, when they make against it.

After this follows that odious Forgery, called Constantine's Donation, wherein
he is pretended to make over to the Pope, the whole City of Rome and all the
Western Empire, with all kind of Ensigns of Imperial Majesty, and all manner of
Jurisdiction; which Ridiculous Fiction ( Nauclerus says) Antoninus rejected in
his Chronicle, because it is not extant in any ancient Author, but only in the
Decretals Naucler. Chron. genesis XI. page 604.
. But our Editors print it without any Note of its being false; yea, with Notes
upon it, to prove it either true or very probable Lab. p. 1534. Bin. page 251.
col. 2. and p. 254. col. 1.
. And Baronius introduces it with many Stories, to make all that concerns the
Popes temporal Greatness credible to an easy Reader Baron. An. 324.. 117.
; yet at last, to secure their Retreat from so indefensible a Post, He and the
Annotator make it a Fiction of the poor Greeks: I shall therefore, First, prove
it a Forgery; and, Secondly, make it out, That not the Greeks, but the Pope's
Creatures devised it. First, That it is a Fiction appears from diverse
Arguments: For, First, who can believe Constantine, so unjust, first, to give
Rome and the Western Empire to the Pope, and then to one of his Sons? Or who
can think the Pope so tame never to put in his Claim? Secondly, This Edict is
grounded on the idle Story of Constantine's Baptism by Sylvester, which out of
Sylvester's Fabulous Acts is related at large in it; but those Acts being (as
was showed) a mere Forgery, this Edict must be so also. Thirdly, It represents
Constantine, who was born and brought up under Christian Parents, and had
settled Christianity before this, as a mere Heathen, till he met with Sylvester
at this time. Fourthly, It pretends the whole Senate and all the Nobles joined
with the Emperor, to give the Pope this Power. But besides the folly of
Constantine's delegating more Power than ever he himself had, it is most false
to suppose, That the whole Senate at this time were Christians; for many of
them continued Pagans long after Constantine's Death. Baronius indeed (out of
Sylvester's Acts) affirms, That none of the Senate was converted before the
Year 324 Baron. An. 324.. 76.
. Forgetting that he had told us, Diverse Senators had given up their Names to
Christ Twelve years before Id. An. 312.. 75, and 76.
; and that one or both of the Consuls were Christians two years before this Id.
An. 322.. 1.
. So ill a Memory had the great Cardinal, when his Cause obliged him to defend
a Lie. Fifthly, It speaks of the Emperor's intending to build a City, and call
it by his own Name, in the Province of Bizantium, and his Resolution to
transfer his Empire thither; and yet before this, the Edict had reckoned up
Constantinople by name, and Jerusalem, as two of the Five Patriarchates, and
given Rome Jurisdiction over all the other Four. Lastly, It is Dated in the
Fourth Consulship of Constantine with Gallicanus, whereas Licinius was his
Colleague in his Fourth Consulship, which was in the Year of Christ 315, that
is, Nine years before the time fixed by Baronius for this pretended Baptism;
and that clearly shows the Story to be all Sham, as all modest and learned Men
of the Roman Church do now acknowledge: But Baronius, and our Annota^or,
considering not barely the falsehood of this Edict, (for that alone would not
discourage them;) but observing also, that it destroys the pretended Divine
Right of the Pope's Supremacy, grant it at last to be a Forgery, but say, It
was devised by the Greeks. Secondly, Therefore I shall show the Falsehood of
that Accusation: For, First, they charge Balsamon with publishing it; Now he
did not write till An. 1180, yet the Notes out of Baronius do confess, that a
Pope quoted it An. 1054, (that is, near an Hundred years before Balsamen was
born) to justify his Superiority over the Greek Church; and therefore Balsamon
was not the Inventer of it: Secondly, It does the Greeks no good, for it gives
the Pope power over all their Patriarchs, and reckons Constantinople as the
last and lowest Patriarchate, so that the Forger could not come out of that
Church. Thirdly, It is grounded on the fabulous Acts of Sylvester, writ in
Latin, and feigned in the Western World; and its whole design is to advance the
Pope above all Bishops, Kings, and Emperors; and therefore no doubt it was
advanced by a Friend of the Popes. Fourthly, The Notes confess, That a Pope
first set up this Edict, to prove his Universal Supremacy, (not considering
with Baronius, it seems, that it weakened his Title) and the grave and learned
Men of the Roman Church received it as Authentic for many Ages after. We add,
That till the Reformation they cited it, and writ in defense of it; and though
now their Point is gained they begin to renounce it, yet the Advantage that
Church got by it, shows, that they were the Forgers of it; yea, it seems Anno
1339 one Johannes Diaconus, a Member of the Roman Church, was thought to be the
Author of it. Fifthly, Whoever considers how unwilling the Cardinal and our
Annotator are to have it clearly re^ected, will be convinced, that their Church
gained by it, and consequently invented it. They labor to prove, the Pop^s
temporal Power granted hereby, is both probable and true Lab. p. 1539. Bin.
page 254. col. 1.
: And though they own the French Princes, Pipin and Charles, who gave many
Cities and Countries to S. Peter, never mention this Edict; yet they argue from
their calling those Gifts, A restoring them to the Church, that they had
respect to Constantine's Bounty Lab. p. 1540. Bin. page 254. col. 2.
. These Authors also mention Pope Adrian's confirming this Edict, and quote the
Book of Constantine's Munificence (showed to be a Fable just now) to justify
it Lab. p. 1541. Bin. page 255. col. 1.
. They also would make out what it says of the Images of Peter and Paul, then
kept at Rome, by Eusebius, but cite him falsely, leaving out the main part of
his Testimony; viz. That it was only some who had such Images, and that these
imitated the Pagans herein; from whence it will not follow, That eminent
Christians then placed them in their Churches Lab. and Bin. ut supr. Baron. An.

. In short, Though they dare not say it is true, yet they would not have it
rejected as false, because it gives their admired Church so much Riches and
Power; and therefore doubtless no Greeks, but some of their Church invented
this most notorious Forgery: And Aeneas Sylvius observes, That it was warily
done of the Popes, to let it be hotly disputed how far this Edict was good in
Law, that so the Edict it self might still be supposed valid Aene. Sylv. dial
de Donat. Constantini.
, it being their Interest it should be thought so.

This feigned Donation is followed by a Roman Council under Sylvester, in the
Preface whereof Sylvester is falsely pretended to have called the Nicene
Council; and in the body of which there is a Canon, That none must judge the
Chief Seat; not the Emperor, nor Kings, nor Clergy, nor People. For the sake of
which two advantageous Fictions, Baronius and the Annotator, defend and
justify this Synod Baron. An. 324.. 29, 30, and 130. Bin. not. p. 260.
; though the Title be ridiculous, the Style barbarous, and the Matter of it as
void of Sense as it is of probability, Labbe indeed notes, That the Condemning
Photinus here shows, it was put together by an unskilful Hand Lab. Marg. page
1542.
, and rejects it as a Forgery very justly: For Photinus (as the Notes confess)
was not Condemned till long after Bin. p. 260. col. 1.
; nor were there any Christian Kings, but Constantine the Emperor at that time.
Besides, the Forger first says, None of the Laity were present; and yet in the
next Page affirms, That Calpharnius (Prefect of the City) was there, and that
Constantine and his Mother Helena subscribed it Lab. p. 1547. Bin. page 256.
col. 2. and page 257. col. 2.
; yea, Baronius himself observes, That this Council mistakes the Custom of the
Roman Church, where in that Age Presbyters use to sit in the presence of the
Bishops; but in this Fiction, they are represented as standing with the Deacons
Baron. An. 324.. 124.
. Moreover, it destroys the Donation (Lies seldom hanging together;) for if
Constantine had given the Pope such Supreme Power a few days before, what need
was there for these Bishops to grant the same thing; or however, why do they
not remember Constantine's late Gift? Lastly, Arius (who then gave so great
Trouble to the Church) is not mentioned here; not (as Baronius guesses) because
he was to be more solemnly Condemned at Nice the next year Baron. An. 324.. 27.
Lab. p. 1555. Bin. page 260. col. 2. An. Dom. 325.
; but because the Forger had nothing in his Eye, but merely to set off the
Grandeur of Rome.

. 17. We are now come to the First and most famous General Council of Nice,
wherein the worst and most dangerous of all Heresies was suppressed; and yet
the pretended Judge of all Controversies, and Supreme Head of the Church, had
so little share in this glorious Transaction, that it is very uncertain in what
Popes time it was called: Sozomen and Nicephorus say, it was in the time of
Julius Sozom. hist. lib. 1. cap. 16. Niceph. lib. 8. cap. 14.
; Others think it was in Sylvester's time; Phetius affirms, it was in the times
of both Sylvester and Julius Phot. de 7. Synod.
, though unhappily Pope Mark was between them two: Yet this Council is
introduced by a Preface a la Mode a Rome, styled. The History of the Council of
Nice Lab. Tom. II. page 3. Bin. page 262.
, wherein (as well as in the Notes and various Editions of this famous Council)
all imaginable Artifice is used to abuse the Reader into a belief, That Pope
Sylvester not only called this Council, and presided in it by his Legates; but
also confirmed it by his sole Authority afterward. For the clearer Confutation
of which Falsehoods, we will consider, First, The Authority which convened this
Council. Secondly, The President of it, with the Order of Sitting in it, and
Subscribing to it. Thirdly, The Power which confirmed it. Fourthly, The number
of the Canons. Fifthly, The true Sense of them. Sixthly, The Forgeries for
Supremacy herein inserted. Seventhly, The corrupt Editions of the Council it
self.

First, As to the Authority convening it. The Preface says, Constantine
assembled it by Sylvester 's Authority Lab. p. 3. and Bin. page 262.
: The Notes affirm, -- it was appointed by the Advice, Counsel, and Authority
of Pope Sylvester; and again, -- Pope Sylvester, by his Pontifical Authority,
decreed the celebration of a General Council Lab. p. 63. C. Bin. page 291. col.
1.
. To prove these vain Brags, they cite Ruffinus (whose Version of this Council
they reject;) yet he only says, That Constantine convened it by the Advice of
the Bishops: However, this is Advice, not Authority; and Advice of the Bishops
in general, not of Sylvester in particular; and if any Bishops did give the
Emperor particular Advice, it was those of Alexandria and Constantinople, not
He of Rome. Secondly, They quote the Sixth General Council (held 350 years
after this of Nice, and in other things rejected by the Romanists) which says,
-- this Council was called by Sylvester and Constantine: But they quote falsely,
for that Sixth Synod puts the Emperor's Name first Bin. Tom. III. par. 1. page
194.
; and though they are no Evidence against Authors living in the time of the
Nicene Council; yet even this shows, they thought the Emperor's Authority was
chiefest in this Matter. The Notes also cite the Pontifical (which they have so
often rejected as Fabulous) and Sozomen, as if they said the same thing: But
for Sozomen, he never names Sylvester; but says, Pope Julius was absent by
reason of his great Age; and the Pontifical only says, It was called by the
Consent of Sylvester; not by his Authority; and indeed it was called by the
consent of all Orthodox Bishops: Wherefore there is no good Evidence, that the
Pope did call it. But on the other side, All the Ecclesiastical Historians do
agree, That Constantine Convened it by his own Authority, and sent his Letters
to Command the Bishops to meet at Nice Eusebius. vit. Constant. lib. 3. cap. 6.
Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 8. Theod. lib. 1. cap. 7. Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 17.
; and not one of them mentions Sylvester, as having any hand in this M^tter:
Yea, (to put us out of all doubt) the very Council of Nice it self (in their
Synodal Epistle writ to Alexandria, and extant in these very Editors Lab. p.
^9. Bin. page 285. and Baron. An. 325.. 117.
expressly declares, That they were Convened by Constantine's Command. Which
clear and convincing Proofs, show the Impudence, as well as the Falsehood of the
Annalist and Annotator, to talk so confidently of the Pope's Authority in this
Matter; who, if he had (as they pretend) Convened this Council, should have
summoned more Western Bishops, of which there were so few in this Council, that
it is plain, Either Sylvester did not Summon them, or they did not obey his
Summons.

Secondly, As to the President of this Council, and the Order of Si ting in it,
and Subscribing to it: The Preface and Notes falsely affirm, That Hosius, Vitus,
and Vincentius were all three the Pope's Legates, and Presidents of this
Council Labbe p. 3, and 65. Bin. page 263, and 291.
; and vainly think, if it had not been so, it could not have been a General
Council: But if this be necessary to the Being of a General Council, surely
there is some good Evidence of it. Quite contrary! The Preface to the Sardican
Council is of the Editors, or their Friends making, and so is no Proof:
Athanasius says, Hosius was a Prince in the Synods; but not that he was
President of this Synod, or the Pope's Legate. Cedrenus and Photius are too
late Authors to outweigh more Ancient and Authentic Writers; yet they do not
say, (as the Notes pretend) That Sylvester, by his Legates, gave Authority to
this Council: Yea, Photius places the Bishop of Constantinople before Sylvester
and Julius, even when he is speaking of the Chief Bishops, who met at Nice; and
he is grossly mistaken also, because neither of the Popes did meet there Photii
Nomocan. page 163.
. Socrates only says, The Bishop of Rome 's Presbyters were his Proxies, and
present at this Council Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 5.
; but hereby he excludes Hosius (who was a Bishop) from being a Legate, and
does not at all prove Vitus and Vincentius were Presidents. Sozomen names not
Hosius, but these two Presbyters as the Proxies of Pope Julius; but reckons
that Pope himself in the fourth place Sozom. hist. lib. 1. cap. 16.
. Though these Notes in citing Sozomen (according to their usual sincerity)
place the Bishop of Rome first, and all the other Patriarchs after him.
Finally, They cite the Subscriptions to prove, these Three were Legates and
Presidents at Nice; but Richerius (a Learned Romanist) says, These
Subscriptions are of as little Credit, as the Epistle to Sylvester Richer de
Council. genesis lib. 1. cap. 2. 6.
; and adds, That the placing these Presbyters before the Bishops, is a plain
Proof, That all these Subscriptions were invented in later Ages; because the
Pope's Legates never did precede any of the Patriarchs, till the Council of
Chalcedon Id. ib.. 8.
. As for Hosius, he had been the Emperor's Legate long before, and diverse of
the Ancients say, He was very Eminent in this Council; but not one of them
affirms, that Hosius was the Pope's Legate: This is purely an Invention of
Baronius; but he only proves it by Conjectures Baron. An. 325.. 20.
. The Truth is, Constantine himself was the President of this Council, and Sat
on a Gilded Throne (not as the Preface says falsely, Below all the Bishops;
but) Above all the Bishops, as Eusebius an Eyewitness relates Eusebius. vit.
Constant. lib. 3. cap. 10.
; and the Notes at last own, He sat in the Chief Place Lab. page 67. Bin. page
292. col 2.
; yea, the Annalist confesses, He acted the part of a Moderator in it Baron.
An. 325.. 73.
. Richerius goes further, saying, It is clear by undoubted Testimonies, that
the Appointing and Convening of this Council depended on the Authority of
Constantine, who was the President thereof Richer. hist. Con. cap. 2. 2, 3, 4.
; and he blames Baronius and Binius, for wilfully mistaking the Pope's Consent
(which was requisite, as he was Bishop of an Eminent Church) for his Authority,
to which no Pope in that Age pretended. It is true, there were some Bishops,
who were Chief among the Ecclesiastics in this Council: Eustathius, Bishop of
Antioch sat uppermost on the Right-side, and opened the Synod with a Speech to
Constantine Theodoret. apud Baron. An. 325.. 54.
: Hence some (and among the rest Pope Foelix, in his Epistle to Zeno) affirm,
He was President of this Council Vid Richer. hist. Council. lib. 1. cap. 2.. 8.
: Others say, The Bishop of Alexandria presided; and indeed all the Patriarchs
present, Sat above all others of the Clergy Phot. lib. d. 7. Synod.
; yet so, as they all gave place to the Emperor, when he came in. And for the
Pope's Legates, Baronius and Bellarmin do contend in vain about the Places they
had in this Council since no Ancient Author tells us, they Sat above the Chief
of the Bishops: So that this also is a Forgery of the Papal Flatterers, to give
Countenance to their Churches feigned Supremacy.

Thirdly, As to the Power which confirmed the Canons of this Council; the
ancient Historians do suppose that Constantine gave these Decrees their binding
Power, and Record his Letters, to enjoin all to observe them Vid Socrat. Sozom.
Theodoret. and Ruffin. ut supra.
. And Eusebius who was there, says, that The Emperor ratified the Decrees with
his Seal Eusebius. vit. Constan lib. 1. cap. 37.
; But the Annalist and Annotator seek to efface this evidence, by Railing at
Eusebius, and by devising many weak pretenses, to persuade the Credulous, that
Pope Sylvester confirmed this Council by his Authority; and both the Preface
and Notes tell us, that this Synod writ a Letter to Sylvester for his
confirmation, and that he called a Council at Rome; and writ back to Ratify
what they had done Lab. p. 6. and page 7^. Bin. page 64. and page 299. col. 1.
: But whoever will but read these two Epistles, will find the Latin so
Barbarous and the Sense so Intricate, that nothing is plain in them, but that
they are Forged Lab p. 68. Bin. page 348. col. 1.
; and Labbe's Margin tells us they are Fictions, nor dare Baronius own them to
be genuine Baron. An. 325.. 37.
; and though Binius cite them for evidence in his Notes, yet at some distance
he tells us, it is evident they are both Corrupted Bin. p. 348. col. 1. marg.
; and again he says, if they were not both extreme faulty and Commentitious,
they might be Evidence in this case Idem p. 365. col. 1. not. ad. Council. Romans
: But Richerius is more Ingenuous, and declares, That these Epistles are
prodigiously ^alse, The Forger of them being so Ignorant as to call Macarius,
(who was then Bishop of Jerusalem) Bishop of Constantinople: Yet our Annotator
cites Dionysius Exiguus for a Witness of these Epistles; whereas Richerius
shows, they were Forged by some Ignorant Monk long after Dionysius his time,
who mentions not the Pope 's confirming of these Canons; nor does he remember
these Epistles; but only says it was agreed, these Canons should be sent to
Sylvester Bishop of Rome Richer hist. Council. lib. 1. cap. 2.. 6.
; The Notes further urge, a Roman Council under Pope Sylvester, to prove his
Confirming these Canons; but that Council is a confessed Forgery it self, and
so proves nothing Labbe marg. page 412.
. Lastly, The Annotator here (and almost every where) cites Socrates his
speaking of an Ecclesiastical Canon, that no Decrees of Councils should be
valid without the consent of the Roman Bishop Socrat. histor. lib. 2. cap. 13.
. But First, Consent is not Confirmation; It is the privilege of every
Patriarch as well as of him of Rome, That a Gener^l Council cannot be held
without every one of their consents; but this proves not their pretended sole
and supreme Power of ratifying all Councils vested in the Pope: Besides,
Socrates here only Historically relates what Pope Julius said in his own Case;
and therefore the Testimony relies on Julius his Credit; and indeed that was a
peculiar Case, wherein, when the Cause of Athanasius was referred by consent of
all parties to Julius as Arbitrator, the Arians took it out of his Hands
against Athanasius his Mind; and judged it in a Council, to which Julius was
not at all summoned, which doubtless was very illegal and unjust: But yet none
can tell, where this Ecclesiastical Canon was made, which the angry and injured
Pope here cites; and therefore till it appear whence Julius had this Canon, we
must be excused, if we give no great Deference to it; and unless they could
prove it was R^corded before the Nicene Council, it is very impertinent to
expect the Nicene Fathers should Govern their Actions by it. So that we
conclude not Sylvester, but Constantine confirmed this Council.

Fourthly, As to the number of the Canons the Annotator also notoriously
prevaricates; He confesses that all the Greeks, and particularly Theodoret and
Ruffinus, assert there were but Twenty Canons made there; yea, that the Sixth
Council of Carthage, (within less than an Hundred years,) after a diligent
search in the three Patriarchal Seats of Alexandria, Antioch and
Constantinople, could find no more than Twenty Canons Lab. p. 71. Bin. page
395. col. 2.
: But the Notes conceal Gratian's naming no more but Twenty Canons, and his
saying, there are but only Twenty Nicene Canons to be found in the Roman Church
Gratian. did. 16. cap. 10. and cap. 13.
. For all this the Annotator boldly tells us, That the truer Opinion, (or
rather that which is most for the Popes interest) is, that more than Twenty
Canons were made there: But we will examine his and Baronius's reasons Baron.
An. 325.. 157. etc.
. First, They say there is no Decree about Easter among the Twenty Canons: I
reply, There is a genuine Epistle of Constantine's, in which this matter is
determined with the reasons for it, which is better than a bare Law without
Arguments, in a case which had been so much disputed Bin. p. 285. and Theod.
lib. 1. cap. 9.
; nor could they make any acurate Canon, about it till the exact time was
Calculated, which they referred (not to the Pope, but) to the Bishop of
Alexandria. Secondly, The Notes say S. Ambrose mentions a Canon made at Nice,
against Bigamists Ambros. ep. 82. ad Episc. Vercel.
; but Baronius himself confesses, that S. Ambrose only says, They treated of
this matter, but does not affirm they made a Canon about it. Thirdly, They
plead, there was a Decree about the Canon of Scripture made at Nice, (which is
not among these Twenty) because S. Hierom says, he had Read that the Nicene
Fathers computed Judith, among the Books of Holy Scripture. I reply -- S.
Hierom only says they computed it among Holy Writings, that is, (as we showed
before 15.) among Books to be Read for instruction, not to be quoted in
Dispute: For if S. Hierom had believed this Council did receive Judith for
Canonical, he would not have counted it (as he does) to be Apocryphal; So that
this proves not that there were more Canons. Fourthly, The Notes affirm there
is no Canon now extant here, against a Bishops choosing his Successor in his
Life time; which S. Augustine says was forbid in this Council Augustine. Epist.
110.
; which is a gross Untruth, since the Eighth Canon forbids two Bishops should
be in one City; and the Notes own this was the very Canon meant by S.
Augustine, in the next Leaf Bin. Not. page 296. col. 1. and p. 297. col. 2.
: Liers should have better Memories: Fifthly, They say the third Council of
Carithage cites a Canon of Nice, forbidding to receive the Sacrament after
Dinner; but if the place be considered (as Richerius notes Richer. histor.
Council. lib. 1. cap. 3.. 13.
) that Council only refers to a former African Synod, which had decreed this,
and not to the Council of Nice. Sixthly, The Annotator speaks of a Canon about
Appeals to Rome, cited out of this Synod in the Sixth Council of Carthage, but
he was wiser than to tell us who cited this for a Nicene Canon; for it was Pope
Zosimus's Legate cited it, and he was convicted of a notorious Falsification
therein, as shall be showed in due place. Seventhly, He says there was a Canon
made at Nice; but not to be found among the Twenty, that a Cause tried in a
lesser Synod, might be judged over again in a greater; and for this he cites
the Fourth Epistle of Julius; but in his Notes on that Epistle Bin. Not. in ep.
Julii. p^g. 395. col. 2.
, he confesses this was no Canon made at Nice, but only it was matter of Fact;
in that this great Synod did judge Arius over again, who had before been judged
at Alexandria. Eighthly, The Notes say, Atticus, Bishop of Constantinople at
Chalcedon, did affirm, that the Nicene Council agreed upon a Form of writing
Communicatory Epistles, which is not among these Twenty Canons: I reply,
Baronius and he both own this Form was to be a Secret among the Bishops; and if
it had been put into a Canon, Heretics might easily have counterfeited these
Forms, and so the design had been spoiled Baron. An. 325.. 166. and Richer.
lib. 1. cap. 3.. 14.
. Lastly, the Annotator cites Sozomen, to proves that the Nicene Council added
to the Gloria Patri the later part, As it was in the beginning, etc. Whereas
Sozomen Sozom. histor. lib. 3. cap. 19.
in that place only speaks of such as praised God in Hymns, agreeing to the
Faith delivered at Nice, but mentions no Canon or Form of words agreed on at
Nice, about these Hymns. So that after all this shuffling, it is very
impertinent for this Annotator to brag, that it is manifest there were more
than Twenty Canons made in this Council; and Nonsense to tell us, that the
Greeks who stiffly maintain there were but Twenty Canons, cannot deny but there
were more than Twenty: And for all his Confidence, neither he nor Baronius dare
defend those Eighty Canons, which Turrian has fathered on this Council; and
therefore whatever is more than these twenty, or differing from them, must pass
among the many Forgeries of the Roman Church

Fifthly, As to the Sense of those Canons, which oppose the Pope's Interest,
the Notes use many Impostures in expounding them. The Third Canon forbids the
Clergy to cohabit with Women taken into their Houses; unless they were so near
of Kin, as to avoid Suspicion and Scandal: Which plainly supposes, that they
might have Wives, because cohabiting with them, could give no Suspicion nor
Scandal* And since the Canon names not Wives, who were the most likely to dwell
with their Husbands, doubtless this Council did not suppose the cohabitation of
the Clergy with their Wives to be unlawful. Yea, not only Socrates and Sozomen
Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 8. Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 22.
; but Pisanus and Nauclerus, later Romish Authors Pisanus ap. Bin. page 343.
col. 1. Naucler. Chron. page 606.
, relate the History of Paphnutius his Advice to the Council in this Point;
upon which the latter says, The Nicene Fathers allowed Priests to have Wives,
if they pleased: Which full Evidence against their Churches practice does so
enrage Baronius, that he not only denies this well-attested History, but lays
by the Character of an Historian, and falls (in his guessing-way) to dispute
against this manifest Truth Baron. An. 325.. 148, 149, 150.
. And Binius in his Notes Lab. page 72. Bin. page 296. col. 2.
out of him, says, This Canon expressly forbids Clergy men the Use of their
Wives, after they were entered into Holy Orders; rejects the History of
Paphnutius, and gives Socrates and Sozomen the Lie: But we shall leave the
Reader to judge, whether he will give more Credit to the Words of the Canon,
and these Ancient impartial Historians; or to the Corrupt Paraphrase, and
Impudent Assertions of these two notorious Sycophants, who have so often been
proved to govern themselves, not by Truth, but by Interest and Design. The
Sixth Canon reckons the Pope but Equal to other great Bishops, and limits his
Jurisdiction; at which the Annalist and Annotator are much discomposed, and (by
various Fictions and shuffling Pretenses) labor to pervert the true Sense of
this famous Canon. And first, They say, The beginning of it (viz. The Roman
Church has always had the Primacy) is wanting Lab. and Bin. ut supr. not. in
Can. 6.
: Whereas no Authentic Edition ever had any such beginning. Dr. Beveridge gives
us Eight several Versions, besides the Original Greek, which all want it
Beveridg. Council. Tom. II. page 50.
; and it is impudently done of Binius, to cite Alanus Copus, saying, That
Dionysius Exiguus's Version had this beginning; since that very Version is
printed by Binius himself, without any such Preamble Lab. p. 45, 46. Bin. page
276.
; but it is all one to him, true or false, in his Notes, he makes a foolish
Paraphrase on this Forged Preface, about the Divine Right of the Pope to his
Supremacy; whereas the plain Words of the genuine Canon show, That this Council
grounded the Jurisdiction of these great Bishops only upon Ancient Custom
Richer. hist. Council. lib. 1. cap. 2.. 11.
: Nor can it be gathered from this Canon, That the Bishop of Rome then had any
Superiority over him of Alexandria; the one being allowed as much Power within
his own Limits, as the other had in his. It is plain, The Great Bishops are all
here declared to be Equal, without any Exception or Salvo, upon the Bishop of
Rome's account; which would have been mentioned, as well as the Rights of the
Metropolitan of Caesarea are, when the Bishop of Jerusalem's Place is assigned
in the Seventh Canon, if the Council of Nice had believed, Rome had any right
to a Supremacy over all the rest. The Annotator is also angry at Ruffinus; and
though upon the Fourteenth Canon he says, Ruffinus; set down the true authentic
Canons Lab. p. 75. B. Bin. page 298. col. 1.
; yet because his Version of this Sixth Canon limits the Pope's Jurisdiction to
the Suburbicarian Regions; He first falsely represents the Words of Ruffinus,
adding to them, -- which above all others are subject peculiarly to the Diocese
of the Roman Church; and then Rails at the Version it self, as evil, erroneous,
and proceeding from his Ignorance: But doubtless Ruffinus, who lived so near
the time of this Council, and knew Rome and Italy so well, understood the
Pope's Jurisdiction at that time, and the meaning of this Canon far better than
Binius; and therefore Baronius (after he had condemned the Version) yet strives
to accommodate it to their new Roman Sense. But there is full Evidence, that
these Suburbicarian Regions were only those Provinces which were under the
Prefect of Rome; that is, some part of Italy, and some of the adjacent
Islands; and these were all the Churches which were then under the Pope's
Jurisdiction: As may appear by the great difficulty which the succeeding
Bishops of Rome found in the following Ages, to bring Milan, Aquileia, and
Ravenna (Churches in Italy it self) to be in subjection to them: So that the
Pope was so far from having an Universal Supremacy then, that Balsamon is
mistaken in thinking he was made Patriarch of all the Western Church; for the
very Fifth Canon, which orders all Causes to be heard and finally ended in the
same Province where they happened, not only destroys Appeals to Rome, but shows
that no Bishop did then pretend to so large a Jurisdiction. Again, these Notes
frequently brag of that Version of this Canon, which the Pope's Legate cited at
Chalcedon Council. Chalced. Act. 16.
; wherein the aforesaid forged Title of this Canon [ The Church of Rome has
always had the Primacy] are quoted as part of the Canon it self: But the Acts
of that Council of Chalcedon show, That this Edition was discovered to be false
by the Constantinopolitan Code, then produced: And if the Fathers there had
believed this to be the true Reading, they would not immediately have
contradicted the first famous General Council, by giving the Bishop of
Constantinople equal Privileges with him of Old Rome: So that their Quoting a
false, baffled, and rejected Version of this Canon, rather pulls down, than
supports their dear Supremacy; to maintain which they have nothing but
Sophistry and Fraud, as the next Section will show.

Sixthly, Therefore we will consider the Impostures and Fictions annexed to
this Council, to give color to their feigned Supremacy: And first, because
Eusebius speaks little of the Popes, for he could not truly say much of them;
Baronius and the Annotator invent all the Calumnies against him imaginable; and
the former (though he have little true History in his Annals for Three hundred
years together, which is not taken out of Eusebius) Rails at him most unjustly,
as being an Arian; a malicious, fraudulent, and partial Writer Baron. An. 318..
46. An. 324.. 136.. 143, and. 152. item An. 325.. 192, etc.
. And Binius treats this great Historian at the same rate: But Athanasius
expressly says, That Eusebius of Caesarea subscribed the Orthodox Faith Athan.
Apol. cont. Arian. p. 180.
. Socrates affirms also, That he agreed to the Faith of the Nicene Council
Socrat. hist. lib. 1. cap. 3.
. Pisanus, his Greek Author of the History of this Council, brings in Eusebius
disputing against the Arians Bin. p. 313. col. 2.
: And Valesius, in his Life, clears him from this spightful Accusation, which
these Men invent merely to be Revenged on him, for not countenancing the Pope's
Supremacy; which is not his Fault, but his Virtue, because there was no such
thing pretended to in his days. Secondly, These Editors publish a Letter of
Athanasius to Pope Marcus, with that Pope's Answer Lab. p. 287. Bin. page 326.
col. 1, and 2.
, among the Records of this Council; and the Annotator often cites them, to
prove the Supremacy and Infallibility; because the Roman Church is here called,
The Mother and Head of all Churches, and, A Church which had never erred; and
the Pope is called, Bishop of the Universal Church; yet their being Forged is
so notorious, that Bellarmin, Possevin, and Baronius Baron. An. Dom. 336.
reject them. Thirdly, They likewise publish in these Nicene Acts an Epistle of
Pope Julius, wherein diverse Canons for the Primacy are Fathered on this great
Council Bin. p. 328. col. 2.
: And Pisanus is so bold, and so vain as to defend this to be genuine, by an
Epistle of the Egyptians to Pope Foelix (owned to be Forged Bin. p. 499. col. 1.
), and by other Decretal Epistles, as false as this, which he defends; but it
is so manifest a Forgery, this of Pope Julius, that the Editors themselves
afterward reject it Lab. p. 483. Bin. page 391. col. 1.
. Fourthly, Whereas the Ninth Canon of Chalcedon allows the Clergy to complain
to the Primate, or to the Bishop of the Royal City of Constantinople; Notes are
put upon this to falsify that Canon, which say, That Constantinople is here
put for Rome Bin. p. 331. col. 1.
. Fifthly, Here is a Canon called the Thirty ninth of Nice, which says, He
that holds the Sea of Rome is the Head and Prince of all Patriarchs; because he
is first, as Peter, to whom power is given over all Christian Princes and
People Lab. p. 303. Bin. page 337. col. 2.
, which must be a Forgery of some Roman Parasite, because it not only
contradicts the Sixth Canon of the genuine Council of Nice, but the Eighth of
these pretended Canons, which limits the Bishop of Rome's Jurisdiction to the
Places near to him Lab. p. 294. Bin. page 333. col. 1.
. However, the Editors say, Steuchus, Turrian, and Cope cite it; and they print
Turrian's Notes upon it, which affirm it to agree with the Sixth Canon of the
true Edition; and would prove it genuine by no better Evidence, than a Forged
Decretal of Anacletus Bin. p. 358. col. 1.
. By which we see, the most apparent Falsehoods shall be published and defended,
if they do but promote the Supremacy.

Lastly, We will make some Remarks on the Corrupt Editions of this Council:
First, That of Alfonsus Pisanus is so Fabulous, that Labbe for mere shame omits
it Lab. Marg. page 106.
; but Binius prints it at large, with all its Fictions and Impostures Bin. p.
300. col. 1.
; of which Richerius gives this Character, By this History of Pisanus we may
learn, not what the Council of Nice was, but what it should be to fit it for a
Jesuits Palate; for he has scraped together all the Falsehoods and Forgeries he
could find, for enlarging the number of the Canons Richer. hist. Council. lib.
1. cap. 2.. ult.
. But I must add, that there are diverse Passages in this Edition, which will
not serve the ends of the modern Roman Flatterers: For first, Pisanus his Greek
Author highly extols Eusebius Bin. p. 301. col. 2. and 302. col. 2.
; for which the Jesuit corrects him with a Note in the Margen. Secondly, The
Orthodox Bishop bids the Philosopher believe that which was written, but not to
regard things unwritten; because the Faith is grounded on Holy Scripture Bin.
p. 316. col. 1.
: Whereas the Margen cautions the Reader, not to think that this is spoken
against Ecclesiastical Traditions, though it be levelled at them. Thirdly,
Hosius does not subscribe (as the Pope's Legates here do) for Pope Sylvester;
wherefore this Compiler did not think him to be the Popes Legate Bin. p. 322.
col. 1.
. Fourthly, It is here said to have been declared at Nice, That every Bishop
under God was the Head of his own Church Bin. p. 325. col. 2.
. Fifthly, Here is printed that part of the African Bishop's Letter to
Celestine, wherein they blame his Legate for falsely citing the Nicene Canons
Bin. page 328. col. 1.
. So also the LXXX Canons were not invented by a Through-paced Friend to the
Roman Modern Interest, and therefore probably Baronius will not defend them
Baron. An. 325.. 53.
. The 8th Canon (as was noted) limits the Pope's Jurisdiction to such places as
were near him: The 24th and 66th of these Canons clearly declare, that some
Bishops had Wives Bin p. 335. col. 2. and p. 341. col. 1.
, forbidding Bigamy, and compelling them to take their first Wife again. And
there are other like Examples which are not worth setting down, because they
are all forged in later times, as appears by their citing a fabulous Discourse
out of the Life of S. Anthony, falsely ascribed to the great Athanasius Bin. p.
302. col. 2. Vid. Rivet. Crit. sacr. l. 3. cap. 4.
, by their quoting a spurious Work under the name of Dionysius Areopagita,
which was (as all agree) writ after the Nicene Council many years Bin. page
336. col. 2.
: By their giving the Patriarch of Antioch Jurisdiction over the Archbishop of
Cyprus, who was always free from that subjection, as was declared long after in
the Council of Ephesus Bin. p. 337. col. 1. Vid. Council. Ephesin. Act. 7.
. Finally, Though this Pisanus do impudently reject the true story of
Paphnutius his advising to leave the Clergy at liberty to Marry; which History
is in his Author, and in Gelasius Cyzicenus also: Yet he magnifies a ridiculous
Fiction afterward of two Bishops, which signed the Nicene Faith after they were
dead and buried Bin. p. 347. col 2.
. A Fable so gross, that Baronius rejects it, with a Note which I wish he had
often remembered, viz. That it was not usual Among Christians to confirm the
Faith by Miracles, which was attested by more firm Evidences of Holy Scripture
Baron. An. 325.. 182.
. Secondly, Turrians Edition of this Council repeats all these LXXX Canons, and
in his Preface and his Notes he vindicates them all; and yet the Tracts which
he cites to prove these Canons genuine, are owned to be spurious by all modest
Romanists, and his Arguments are so trifling they are not worth confuting. We
will only note therefore, that the 7th and the 40th of these Canons require,
that Synods shall be held twice a year, which (as Turrian confesses) agrees
not with the custom of the Roman Church Lab. p. 294. and page 303. Bin. page
353. col. 2. and 358. col. 1.
: And his Notes say, the 72d Canon differs from the 13th, and the 73d Canon is
contrary to the 49th Lab. p. 315. Bin. page 363. col. 1, and 2.
; but he will rather suppose the Holy Nicene Fathers contradicted themselves,
than own any of these Canons to be forged, because some of them seem to favor
the Pope's Supremacy. As to the Edition of Gelasius Cyzicenus, it is generally
a very modest account of this Council, and has not many Errors in it, but like
all other ancient Authors it speaks very little of the Pope; for which Reason
Binius claps it under Hatches, and will not produce it till the latter end of
his Second Tome after the Council of Ephesus, to convince us, That all Authors
are valued or slighted merely as they promote or discourage the Usurpations of
Rome.

. 18. To all these Impostures, contrived to misrepresent this famous general
Council, there is tacked a Third Council at Rome under Sylvester in the
presence of Constantine, wherein that Pope with 275 Bishops are said to confirm
the Nicene Council, and make two or three new Canons Lab. p. 412. Bin. page
365. col. 1. Baron. An. 325.. 199.
. But though it be certain and confessed by Binius and Baronius, that
Constantine was not then at Rome, though the Style be barbarous, and the Matter
frivolous, and the thing be a manifest Forgery contrived to carry on the grand
Cheat of Sylvester's confirming the Council of Nice; yet Baronius and Binius
(who confess the Title to be false) labor to prove this Synod to be true,
though Binius be forced to justify it by the forged Letter of the Nicene
Fathers to Sylvester, and his Answer to them, both which in the next Column he
owns are false and feigned Bin. p. 365. col. 2 C
. And thus where the Supremacy is concerned, one Forgery serves for the
Evidence of another.

The Council at Gangra is genuine, and was an uncorrupted Remain of Primitive
Antiquity, till it fell into the hands of these Editors, who have put the name
of Osius, Bishop of Corduba, into the Title in their Latin Version; and though
that Name be not found in the Original Greek printed over against it; yet from
this Fiction of their own Lab. p. 414. Bin. page 366. col. 1.
the Notes impudently say, That this Synod was Convened by Sylvester 's
Authority, and from Osius his presence in it, Binius certainly gathers it was
celebrated under this Pope; but a little after he knows not in what year it was
held; and Baronius treats of this Council Anno 361, that is, near 30 years
after Sylvester's Death Lab. p. 427, and 428. Bin. page 371. col. 1. Baron. An.
361. 44.
. They tell us that Pope Symmachus in his 6th Roman Council approves this
Synod, but he mentions not Osius; however Baronius guesses, that the reason why
Symmachus approved it was, because Osius the Legate of the Apostolic See was
there; which groundless Conjecture and false Assertion, Binius in his Notes
turns into a positive Affirmation, viz. That Osius was there as the Pope's
Legate. As to the occasion of calling this Council of Gangra, it was to condemn
one Eustathius, whom Binius owns to have been a great Favourer of Monkish life,
and Sozomen says, he was a Monk Sozom, lib. 3. cap. 13.
; yea, the Synodical Epistle describes him as one who despised Marriage,
allowed not the administrations of Married Priests, who had a separate way of
Worship, and a different garb from others, making his Followers to abstain from
Flesh, profess Continency, and renounce Propriety Bin. p. 367, etc.
; all which are the very Characters of a Monk of the Roman stamp; and therefore
it is wonder that Binius should give Sozomen and himself the Lie, and say he
was no propagator of Monkery, and that it cannot be proved that he was a Monk;
yet at last he fancies Eustathius his Name was mistaken for Eutachus an
Armenian Monk Lab. p. 429. Bin. page 371. col. 2.
. All which Blunders are only designed to keep the Reader from observing, that
a Monk was condemned for an Heretic, yea, and censured for holding those very
Opinions, which now pass current among the Romish Friars For which end also in
his Notes on the 4th Canon, he says, The Heretics (that is, Protestants)
foolishly apply this Canon to condemn the Celibacy of the Clergy, whereas (he
says) it does not concern Priests who have Wives, but such as had Wives Lab. p
430. Bin. p. 372. col. 2.
. But I doubt it will prove the Romanists are the Heretics here: For both this
Canon, and the Synodical Epistle, have [(...),] which signifies a Priest who
now has a Wife; even as [(...)] 1 Cor. vii. 10. is those that have Wives, and
are actually married; and so the best Version of this Canon is Presbyterum
Conjugatum: For by it all those are Anathematized, who affirm, That men should
not Communicate, if a Married Priest say the Office: That is, this Primitive
Council Anathematizes the Modern Church of Rome, to hide the shame of which
just Censure the Notes quarrel with Our preferring the Translation of their
Friend Dionysius, who turns the word [(...)] Ministrante; before those Versions
which turn it by Sacrificante; as if Protestants did this out of a design to
blot out the Memorial of the unbloody Sacrifice Lab. p. 431. Bin. page 372.
col. 2.
; whereas that Greek word does properly signify Ministering and saying the
Offices of the Church, but no where is used properly for Sacrificing; and it is
apparent, that Protestants do most religiously believe the Sacrament to be an
unbloody Sacrifice, and as such, do make it a Memorial of Christ's one bloody
Sacrifice upon the Cross.

The Notes also blame these Eustathian Heretics for persuading the People to
give them the dispensing of their Alms intended for the Poor, contrary (says
Binius) to the Apostles Doctrine and Constitution Lab. and B^n. ut supra.
. Yet thus the Rom sh Friars do at this day, drawing the Peoples Alms to their
Convents under pretense of being dispensers of them. The same Notes are
mistaken in saying, That the Manicheans were forbid by their Doctrine to give
any Alms to the Poor: For S Augustine (who knew those Heretics best) affirms,
That they only forbad their People, to give Meat or Fruits -- to any Beggar who
was not of their own Sect Aug. de mor. Manich. lib. 2. Tom. l. page 177.
. Lastly, whereas this Council condemns the Eustathians, for abhorring the
Assemblies and Divine Offices used in the places where the Martyrs were
commemorated, Can. ult. These Notes falsely pretend they were condemned, for
disapproving the Worship and Invocation of the holy Martyrs Lab. p. 434. Bin.
page 374. col. 1.
; whereas it is plain by the Canon, that the Martyrs were only Commemorated,
not Invocated nor Worshipped in those days; and the expression in this place, is
only a Phrase to signify the usual Assemblies of Orthodox Christians, which
were then frequently held in the Burying places of the Martyrs, and these
Heretics separated from those public Assemblies.

An. Dom. 335.
The Arians, to revenge their Condemnation at Nice, falsely accuse Athanasius to
the Emperor Constantine, who thereupon called a Council at Tire, which these
Editors entitle, The Council of Tire under Sylvester Lab. p. 435. Bin. page
374. col 1.
. Yet all the Ancients agree the Emperor Called it, and their own Notes
confess as much: Only they pretend, He Called this Council contrary to custom
and his duty; but this is notoriously false, since Constantine had already
called diverse Councils, and particularly that of Nice. And as for Pope
Sylvester, he is not once named in this Council at Tire, which looks a little
odly upon the pretended Supremacy, that when the Catholic Cause lay at the
stake, we never hear one word of the Roman Bishop, neither in this Council, nor
in all the succeeding Letters and Councils relating to Athanasius, till that
Cause was afterward brought before the Pope, as an Arbitrator chosen by both
parties.

An. Dom. 336.
. 19. Pope Marcus succeeded Sylvester, and fat but eight Months; yet, that he
might not seem to have done nothing, The Forgers have invented an Epistle from
Athanasius to this Pope, desiring a true Copy of the Nicene Canons from Rome on
pretense, that the Arians had burnt theirs at Alexandria: To which is annexed
Marcus his Answer, who says he had sent him 70 Canons. Now Binius has often
cited these Epistles, to prove the Popes Supremacy and Infallibility, and to
show there were more than twenty Canons made at Nice, yet here His Notes bring
five substantial Reasons, to prove these Epistles forged; and Labbe notes,
These Wares of Isidore are justly suspected by Baronius, Bellarmine, and other
skilful Catholics, nor does Binius himself doubt of their being spurious Lab.
p. 469. and 472. Bin. page 382. col. 2, etc.
. Yea, it is remarkable, that this very Binius out of Baronius Baron. An. 336..
59, and 60
here confesses, That he who Forged the Epistle of Boniface to Eulalius,
devised also these two Epistles, to consult the Credit of Pope Zosimus and Pope
Boniface, who had cited a Canon out of the Nicene Council, not found among the
genuine 20 Canons. From which we may observe, First, that Binius will cite
those things for the Supremacy, etc. which he knows to be forged. Secondly,
That the great design of all these Forged Records of Antiquity was either to
cover the faults, or consult the honor of the Roman Church, which seems to
have both employed and encouraged the Authors of these Pious Frauds, because
her Pretenses could not be made out by any thing that was Authentic.

Julius succeeded Marcus in the same year, in whose Life the Pontifical
mistakes the Consuls Names, and feigns he was banished Ten Months, which
Baronius proves to have been impossible Baron. An. 352.. 2, and 3.
, He fills up this Popes story (according to his manner) with trifling matters,
and omits the only remarkable thing in his Life, which was his concern in the
Cause of Athanasius. In this Popes name several Epistles are published: The
First from Julius to the Eastern Bishops may be proved fictitious, not only by
the Confession of Baronius and other Learned Romanists Lab. p. 475, in Marg.
Bin. page 384. col. 1.
, but by diverse other Arguments. For is it probable, that Julius would Only be
solicitous about his Supremacy when he writ to the Arians, and not once reprove
them for their Heresy, nor their persecuting Athanasius? is it likely he
should cite the Council of Nice falsely, and feign so many ancient Decrees about
the Primacy of the Pope, and the Nullity of Councils not celebrated by his
Authority? This Forger says, Julius consented to the Nicene Council at the
time of its celebration; but the Romanists agree that it was held in Sylvesters
time. He imperiously forbids the Eastern Bishops to judge any Bishops without
him, and falsely tells them, They all had received their Consecration from Rome,
yea, with the fabulous Pontifical he mistakes the Consuls Name, and puts
Maximianus for Titianus. Yet by this Forgery the Editors would prove, that more
than twenty Canons were made at Nice Lab. Marg. page 477. Bin. page 385. col. 1.
, and (after Baronius had discarded it) Binius by frivolous Notes strives to
justify it as speaking big for the Supremacy Lab. p 480. Bin. page 386. col. 1.
. Secondly, Here is the Eastern Bishops Answer to Julius, wherein though they
call the Pope Father, which was the usual Title of Bishops of great Sees; yet
they expressly deny his having any Authority over them, and affirm he ought to
be subject to the Canons, as well as other Bishops: So that there is no reason
for Binius his Brag, Lo, how they own the Supremacy Lab. Marg. page 482. Bin.
page 386. col. 2.
! For indeed they do not own it at all, and yet the substance of this Epistle
is genuine, being found in Socrates and Sozomen The third Epistle from Julius
to the Arians, is owned by Baronius and others to be a Forgery Lab. p. 483.
Bin. page 387. col. 2.
; and Binius in his Notes upon it says, It is false, corrupted, and stolen
out of diverse Authors Bin. p. 391. col. 1.
, yet the same Binius infamously quotes it over and over for the Supremacy, the
Nullity of Councils not called by the Pope, and the number of the Nicene
Canons. The fourth Epistle of Julius comes not out of the Vatican, but was
preserved in Athanasius his Apology, and is by all accounted genuine, being
writ in an humble style, without any pretenses to the Supremacy Lab. p. 494.
Bin. page 391. col. 1.
. And here the Nicene Canon (about the re-hearing in a New Synod, a Cause not
well judged before) is rightly cited, without mention of any final Appeal to
Rome Lab. p. 495. Bin. ut supr. col. 2.
; The power of all Bishops is supposed to be equal, and not any greater power
to belong to him that is fixed in a greater City. Here Julius writes not his
own Sense, but the Sense of the Bishops of Italy, who were assembled in a Synod
at Rome, of which great City Julius being Bishop ought, by ancient custom, to
publish the Decrees of such Councils as were held in or or near that City Lab.
p. 513. Bin. page 395. col. 1.
; but Binius falsely infers from hence, That it was an honor due to his place,
to publish the Decrees made in all Synods. And whereas, when any thing was
under debate concerning Alexandria (the second Patriarchate) Julius says, it
was a Custom, to write to the Roman Bishop (who was the first Patriarch,)
Binius stretches this and says, It was both agreeable to the Canons and
Custom, that no Bishop should be judged till the Popes definitive Sentence were
heard Lab. p. 516. Bin. page 396. col. 1.
. The last Epistle also is genuine, and writ in a modest style, owning that
Athanasius was not judged by the Pope alone, but by a Synod of Bishops, whose
Judgment he supposes above his own Ep. 4. ap. Lab. Bin. page 396. col. 2.
, and by these two Epistles we may discern the Impostures of those other
Epistles, which are Forged about this time in the Names of this and other
Popes. The Decrees attributed to this Pope are not suitable to the Age, yet we
may note, the third Decree forbids a man to Marry his deceased Brothers Wife,
though his Brother had not known her: Which was shamefully broken by that Pope,
who gave License to King Henry the 8th to marry his Brothers Wife, and this
Decree justifies his Divorce Lab. p. 525. Bin. page 398. col. 1.
.

After these Epistles follows a Roman Synod, wherein Julius with 117 Bishops
confirm the Nicene Council; but Labbe says, it is a hotch-potch made up out of
many Authors, and put into the form of a Council by Isidore Lab. Marg. page
527. Bin. page 400. col. 1.
, and it is dated with the same mistaken Consuls, Felician and Maximian, with
which Julius his entrance into the Pontifical, and all his Forged Epistles are
dated (for his genuine Epistles have no date;) yet Baronius Baron. An. 337.. 67.
and the Notes gravely dispute about the time of this Forged Council, and the
Bishops which were said to be in it; merely to persuade the Reader, that the
Nicene Council needed the Pope's Confirmation; but since this Council is
feigned, it can be no evidence: And therefore Binius gains nothing by alleging
it in his Notes on the third Epistle, but only to show us, that one falsehood is
the fittest prop for another.

. 20. Athanasius being restored to Alexandria, An. Dom. 339.
calls a Synod there of all the Bishops of his Province, of which only the
Synodical Epistle is now extant, written as the Title declares, To all the
Catholic Bishops every where; yet the Notes from Baronius Baron. An. 339.. 2.
and. 11.
say, It was writ particularly to Julius; whereas the Body of the Epistle
says, The Arians have written to the Roman Bishop, and perhaps (speaking to
other Bishops) they have writ to you also: So that this is a falsehood devised
for to make out the Supremacy, which is not countenanced by this Epistle,
wherein we are told, that Religion depends not on the greatness of any City:
Though the Notes say, That Bishops had Honors and Jurisdiction given them,
suiting to the dignity of the Secular Praefects of their several Cities; and
thence Alexandria was reckoned the second Patriarchate, and Antioch the third
Lab. p. 534. Bin page 401. col. 2.
, it follows naturally, therefore Rome was the first Patriarchate: But this
Inference they will not make: I shall only note that this Synod says, The
lawful use of the Cup of the Lord was to make the People Drink Lab. p. 547.
Bin. page 404. col. 2.
; from whence we gather, that the Roman Church (who denies the Cup to the
People) does a very unlawful thing, and leaves off the lawful use of the holy
Chalice.

An. Dom. 341.
The Council of Antioch, is by the Editors said to be held under Julius Lab. p.
559. Bin. page 407.
, yet it was called by Constantius on occasion of dedicating a new Church
there; and the Notes say, the Emperor not only called it, but being present
there, caused such Decrees as he pleased to pass in it Lab. p. 588. Bin. p.
416. col. 1.
; yea, it is evident they valued Pope Julius so little, that they judged quite
otherwise than he had done in the case of Athanasius, and therefore the
Romanists rail at this Synod as a Conventicle of Arians, and in the last Roman
Edition (says Richerius Richer. hist. Conc. lib. 1. cap. 4.
) have left out these Canons as not favoring the practice of the Roman Court.
However Baronius says, Among 97 Bishops, only 36 were Arians Baron. An. 341..
4, and 5.
; and the Canons made here are excellent Rules for Discipline, having been
received into the Code of the Universal Church before S. Chrysostom's time,
confirmed by the Council of Chalcedon, allowed by S. Hillary, and (as Gratian
says) received by the Catholics; and the Learned Richerius has fully answered
all the Cavils of Binius and Baronius, by which they would invalidate them: So
that we need only make some few Remarks on this Council, and so dismiss it. The
12th Canon Orders a Bishop who was deposed, to appeal to a Synod of Bishops,
and allowed none to be restored, unless it were by a greater number of Bishops
than had deposed him Lab. p. 595. Bin. page 417. col. 2.
. But they exclaim against this as a device of the Arians, to take away that
Apostolical and ancient Law and Custom of appealing to Rome, which (they say)
was always observed till now: But hitherto they could never produce any such
Law, nor prove any such Custom; nor did S. Chrysostom ever appeal to Rome, but
desired to be restored by a greater Synod, as this Canon requires Socrat. lib.
6. cap. 16. Vid. Bever. Council. Tom. II. page 191.
, and when his Enemies made that impossible, then indeed he objected that this
Canon was made by Arians; yet the Canon remained in force, and was generally
received in that Age. Nor did the Sardican Council revoke it (as Binius falsely
says Lab. p. 597. Bin. page 418. col. 2. Vid. Richer. ut supr.
): For though they put a new Complement on the Pope, yet they did not take away
the ancient method of appealing from a lesser Synod to a greater. The second
Canon decrees, That such as come to Church to hear part of the Service, and do
not receive the Sacrament, shall be Excommunicated. This the Notes say was to
condemn the old Audian Heretics Lab. p. 596. Bin. page 418. col. 1.
; but it evidently condemns the new Roman Heretics, who since they exalted
their Wafer into a God, expect the People should only gaze at, and adore it
most part of the year, and excuse them, though they often go away without
receiving it. The 25th Canon forbids Bishops to commit the Treasures and Fruits
of the Church to their Kinsmen, Brethren and Sons: Upon which Binius has no
Note, knowing it reflected on the Roman Churches Custom, where the Popes
generally give all they can to their scandalous Nipotismo.

Next to this Council of Antioch, is placed a second Synod at Rome, under Pope
Julius, in the Cause of Athanasius Lab. p. 604. Bin. page 419. col. ^
; but Baronius places it before that of Antioch, An. 340.. 1. And though the
Cardinal confess, That Athanasius and his Enemies by consent had referred this
matter to Julius his Arbitration, and that Athanasius came to Rome after this
Reference was made; yet he vainly remarks on this matter, in these words,
Behold, Reader, the ancient usage for injured Bishops, to come even out of the
East to the Roman Bishop for redress Baron. An. 340.. 2.
. But this is one of the first Instances, and was a mere Arbitration by
consent; and the ancient Usage since the Emperors became Christians was to
appeal to them, as these Parties had done, before it was referred to the Pope.
In this Roman Council it is pretended Athanasius delivered his Creed; but the
Acts of the Council being lost, and the Roman Archives being a repository
neither safe nor creditable, we can have no Evidence from thence of the Truth
and Antiquity of this excellent Composure. One thing however is remarkable,
that Baronius and Binius charge the Greeks with taking away those words [and
the Son] out of this Creed, and add, that they falsely pretended, this was a
late addition of the Latins Lab. p. 605. Bin. page 420. col. 1. Baron. An 340..
12.
. Yet Baronius himself owns, that the Western Church added these words [and the
Son] to the Nicene Creed, above an hundred years after Baron. An. 447.
; so that they accuse the poor Greeks for keeping the Creed, as Athanasius made
it, and as their own Church used to recite the Nicene Creed for many years
after.

An. Dom. 34^.
The year following Julius held a third Synod at Rome, and in it read the Letter
of the Eastern Bishops, wherein they wonder he should cite them to Rome, and so
value himself upon the greatness of his City, as on that account to take upon
him to judge them concerning things which they had determined in their own
Synods. Nor durst Julius challenge any Authority over them, by reason of the
Eminence of his City Baron An. 341.. 56, 57.
: Only he pleads for Athanasius, who being Bishop of an Apostolical See, viz.
Alexandria, ought not to have been condemned by them, till they had writ to all
the Western Bishops, and especially to him as Bishop of the first See, that so
all of them, (viz. in Council) might have determined the matter according to
right Id. An. 342.. 28, 30.
. But Baronius and Binius turn this into their being obliged to write to the
Pope, and to receive what he had defined: And Binius infers, from the Popes
writing this Synodical Letter from a Council held in his own City of Rome
(though the Synod expressly command him to write the Epistle) That in respect to
the Pope, and according to ancient Custom, it was his right to publish Whatever
was agreed on in Councils Lab. p. 608. Bin. page 420: col. 2.
. But such false Consequences from Premises that will not bear them, only show
the Arguers partiality.

After this we have nothing remarkable, but a second Council at Antioch, held
by the Arians, yet bearing this Title under Julius Lab. p. 608. Bin. 420. col.
2.
, wherein the Arians made a New Creed, and sent four Bishops to give Constans
the Emperor and all the Western Bishops an account of their Faith, and they
met these Legates in a Council at Milain; and though it does not appear Julius
was present, yet Baronius makes as if this Embassy from the East was sent to
Julius, chiefly to desire Communion with him Baron. An. 344.. 4.
; and Binius says, They desired to be received into the Communion of the Roman
Church Lab. p. 614. Bin. page 422. col. 1.
. But the ancient Historians assure us, they desired not the Communion of the
Roman only; but of the whole Western Church, of which that was then esteemed no
more than one eminent part.

. 21. The Sardican Synod, An. Dom. 347.
which says some kind things of Rome, is prodigiously magnified by the
Editors, who place an History before it, and partial Notes after it, which are
full of Falsities and designed Misrepresentations: Baronius also spends one
whole year in setting it off to the best advantage; but all their Frauds will
be discovered, by considering, First, By whom it was called: Secondly, Who
presided in it: Thirdly, Of what number of Bishops it consisted: And, Fourthly,
What Authority the Canons of it have.

First, As to the Calling it, the Preface falsely states the occasion thereof:
For it is plain Athanasius did not (as that reports) leave the whole judgment
of his Cause to the Pope Lab. p. 624. Bin. page 423.
; nor did he (as is there said) Fly to Rome, as the Mother of all Churches, and
the Rock of Faith: This is the Prefacers mere Invention. For Athanasius went to
Rome as to the place agreed on by both sides for Arbitrating this matter; and
the other party so little valued the Pope's decision in his favor, that they
would neither restore Athanasius, nor receive him into Communion upon it; which
made Julius complain to the Emperor Constans, who writ to his Brother
Constantius about it; but that Letter did not produce this Council (as the
Preface fully sets out) but only procured a fruitless Embassy of three Eastern
Bishops to Rome. It was the personal Addresses of Athanasius and Paulus, Bishop
of Constantinople, to Constans (when they found the Pope had no power to
restore them) which caused both the Emperors to give order for this Council to
meet, as Sozomen, Socrates and Theodoret affirm Sozem. lib. 3. cap. 19. Socrat.
lib. 2. cap. 16. Theod. lib. 2. cap. 5.
. And the Bishops in their Epistle do expressly say, They were called together
by the most Religious Emperors Lab. p. 670. Bin. page 440.
: But Baronius fraudulently leaves out this beginning of the Bishops Letter
Baron. An. ^47.. 31.
; and the bold Writer of the Preface says, This Council was called by the
Popes Authority: And the Notes offer some Reasons to justify this Falsehood,
yea, they cite the aforesaid Authors, who plainly declare it was called by both
the Emperors, to prove, it was called by the Pope; but they offer nothing
material to make this out. It Is true, Socrates says, Some absent Bishops
complained of the shortness of time, and blamed Julius for it Not. ad Council.
Sardic. Lab. page 685. Bin. page 445. col. 1. Vid. Richer. histor. Council. lib.
1. cap. 3.
; but that does not prove the Council was called by his Authority, only it
supposes, he might advise the Emperor to make them meet speedily; but still
that is no sign of full power.

Secondly, As to the President of this Council, The Preface says boldly, That
Hosius, Archidamus, and Philoxenus presided in the Name of Julius. But first,
it does not appear that Hosius was the Popes Legate, only as an eminent
Confessor he had a chief place in it; whence Sozomen says, Osius and
Protogenes were chief of the Western Bishops here assembled Sozom. lib. 3. cap.
11.
: That is, Osius as an ancient Confessor, and Protogenes as Bishop of Sardia,
where the Council was held; but as for Archidamus and Philoxenus, they are not
in the Latin Copies of the Subscribers Lab. p. 658. Bin. page 436. col. 1.
. And Athanasius only says, Julius subscribed by these two Presbyters; which
shows, that Hosius was not the Popes Legate (for he subscribed in his own name)
and that these Presbyters who were his Legates, were not Presidents of the
Council.

Thirdly, They magnify the number of Bishops also in this Synod, to make it
look like a General Council; where accounts differ they take the largest Baron.

exceeded the first Council of Nice Lab. p. 685. Bin. page 446. col. 1. Baron.
ut supr.. 75.
. Whereas Athanasius expressly reckons only 170, who met at the City of Sardica
Athanas. Epist. ad Solitar. p. 818.
; and when many of the Eastern Bishops withdrew, there were not one hundred
left to pass the Decrees of this Council. It Is true, Athanasius affirms, that
344 Bishops signed the Decree to restore him; but many of these hands were got
from Orthodox Bishops, who were not at the Council Idem Apol. 2. p. 767, and
768.
: So that this was never counted or called a General Council by any, but these
partial Romanists; for though the Emperor seem to have designed it General at
first Socrat. lib. 2. cap. 16.
, yet so few came to it, and they who came agreed so ill (the Eastern Bishops
generally forsaking it) that it is called frequently, A Council of the Western
Church, and so Epiphanius in Baronius describes it Baron. An. 347.. 42.
.

Fourthly, The little regard paid to its Canons afterward shows it was no
General Council. Richerius, a moderate and learned Romanist proves, That this
Council was not extant in Greek in the time of Dionysius Exiguus, so that he
and Pope Leo the 4th reckon it after all the Councils of Note: The Greeks
received not its Canons into their Code, and Pope Nicholas Epistle shows, that
the Eastern Church did not value its Authority, only the Popes esteemed it,
because it seems to advance their power Richer. hist. Council. lib. 1. cap. 3.
. The African Church of old valued this Council as little; for a Synod of
Bishops there (among whom were S. Augustine and Alypius) were ignorant of any
Sardican Council, but one held by the Arians. Baronius tries all his art to
palliate this matter Baron. An. 347.. 73.
; but after all his Conjectures it is plain, it was of no repute in Africa,
because when two Popes Zosimus and Boniface afterward cited the Decrees of
Sardica as Canons of Nice, the Fraud was discovered, and when they were found
not to be Nicene Canons, They would not receive them as Canons of Sardica, but
flatly rejected them; which shows, that these African Fathers did neither take
this Sardican Synod for a General Council, nor for an Authentic Provincial
Council: And therefore whatever is here said in favor of the Roman Church, is
of no great weight. However the Champions of Rome magnify the 4th Canon of
this Council, where in case a Bishop judge that he is condemned unjustly,
Hosius says, If it please you, let us honor the memory of Peter the Apostle,
and let those who have judged such a Bishop write to Julius Bishop of Rome,
that so (if need be) the Judgment may be reviewed by the Bishops of the
Province, and he may appoint some to hear the Cause, etc. Now here the Notes
talk big, and claim a Supremacy and Appeals as due to the Pope by Divine Right
Lab. p. 690, and 691. Bin. page 448. col. 1.
: But Richerius well observes, It is Nonsense, to ascribe that to a human Law
and Privilege, or to the Decree of a Council, which was due before to the Pope
by the Law of God Richer. hist. Con. lib. 1. cap. 3.
. And we add, that Hosius neither cites any Divine Law, no nor any precedent
Canon or Custom for this, but supposes it at the pleasure of this Synod to
grant or deny Julius this privilege: And yet if it were an express Law, this
being only a Western Synod, does not bind the whole Catholic Church. Besides,
it is not said, The Criminal shall appeal to Rome, and have his Cause tried
there; but only, that the Pope (if need were) might order the Cause to be heard
over again in the Province where it was first tried; and therefore Julius is
only made a Judge of the necessity of a Re-hearing, not of the Cause it self,
which according to the 5th Canon of Nice was to be decided in the Province
where it was first moved. And this rather condemns than countenances the modern
Popish way of Trying foreign Causes at Rome by Appeal. To this I will add an
ancient Scholion on this Canon found in some old Copies: From this Canon the
Roman Church is much exalted with Pride; and former evil Popes producing this
as a Canon of Nice, were discovered by a Council at Carthage, as the Preface to
that Council shows: But this Canon (whatever they pretend) gives no more power
to Rome than other Canons, since it says not absolutely, that any who is
deposed any where shall have liberty to appeal to the Pope; for at that rate
the Sardican Synod would contradict the General Councils; it speaks only of him
who is deposed by the Neighboring Bishops and those of his Province, and
therefore does not comprehend the Synod of the Primate Metropolitan, or
Patriarch; so that if they be present, and the Sentence be not barely by the
Neighboring Bishops, the Pope may not re-hear it, as this Canon orders: And it
only concerns those in the West, Hosius and the Makers of these Canons being of
those parts; but in the East this Custom never was observed to this day Schol.
ap. D. Bever. Con. Tom. II. p. 199.
. I shall make one remark or two more, and so dismiss this Council. The Preface
cites Sozomen, to prove, That Hosius and others writ to Julius to confirm these
Canons: But Sozomen only says, They writ to him, to satisfy him that they had
not contradicted the Nicene Canons Sozom. lib. 3. cap. 11. Lab. p. 625. Bin.
page 424.
; and their Epistle (which calls Julius their Fellow-Minister) Lab. p. 670.
Bin. page 440. col. 1.
, desires him, to publish their Decrees, to those in Sicily, Sardinia and
Italy, (which of old were Suburbicarian Regions,) but never speak of his
confirming their Decrees Lab. p. 662. Bin. page 437. col. 2.
. Yet in their Epistle to the Church of Alexandria, they pray them to give
their Suffrage to the Councils determinations Lab. p. 670. Bin. page 439. col.
2.
: Which, had it been writ to the Pope, would have made his Creatures
sufficiently triumph. I observe also, that upon the mention of the Church of
Thessalonica in the 20th Canon, the Notes pretend, that this Church had an
especial regard then, because the Bishop of it was the Pope's Legate; yet the
first proof they give, is, that Pope Leo made Anastasius of Thessalonica his
Legate an hundred years after; and hence (they say) Bellarmine aptly proves the
Popes Supremacy Lab. p. 692. Bin. page 448, col. 2.
: But the Inferences are as ridiculous as they are false, and they get no
advantage either to their Supremacy or Appeals by this Council.

An Dom. 348.
. 22. The first Council of Carthage was appointed to suppress that dangerous
Sect of the Donatists; and though it bear the Title of under Julius, yet this
pretended universal Monarch is not mentioned by the Council, or by any ancient
Author, as having any hand in this great Work, which was managed by Gratus
Bishop of Carthage, and by the Emperors Legates Lab. p. 713. Bin. page 546.
col. 1.
. In this Council were made fourteen excellent Canons, which possibly the
Romanists may reject, because they never asked the Popes consent to hold this
Council, nor desired his confirmation to their Canons; and whereas the Editors
tell us, Pope Leo the 4th (who lived five hundred years after) approved of this
Council, we must observe that the Catholic Church had put them into their Code,
and received them for Authentic long before, without staying for any
Approbation from the Bishop of Rome.

Soon after this, there was a Council at Milan, of which there was no mention,
but only in the Synodical Letter of the Bishops met at Ariminum, An. 359.
Baron. An. 359.. 16. Lab. p. 721. Bin. page 459. col. 1.
; who say, that the Presbyters of Rome were present at it; they say not,
Presidents of it: And there it seems Ursacius and Valens, two Arian Heretics,
abjured their Heresy, and recanted their false Evidence against Athanasius.
And either before or after this Synod (it is not certain whether) they went to
Rome, and in writing delivered their Recantation to Pope Julius Hosii Epist.
ap. Baron. An. 355.. 661.
, before whom they had falsely accused Athanasius, and who was the Arbitrator
chosen to hear that Cause, and so not as Pope, but as a chosen Judge in that
case, was fittest to receive these men's Confessions: Yet hence the Notes make
this Inference, That since this matter was greater, than that a Synod at Milan
(though the Roman Presbyters were present) could dispatch it, and lest the
ancient Custom of the Catholic Church should be broken, viz. for eminent
Heretics to abjure their Heresies only at Rome, and be received into Communion
by the Pope; they sent them to Julius, that having before him offered their
Penitential Letter, they might make their Confession, the whole Roman Church
locking on. All which is their own Invention; for the Authors from whom alone
they have the notice of this Council say nothing of this kind, and it is very
certain that there was at this time, no custom at all for Heretics to abjure at
Rome, more than at any other place, many Heretics being frequently reconciled
at other Churches. There was also a peculiar reason why these two Heretics went
thither, and it cannot be proved that this Council sent them; so that these are
Forgeries, devised to support their dear Supremacy, and so we leave them: Only
noting, That the Editors are not so happy in their Memory as their Invention;
for the next Page shows us a Council at Jerusalem, wherein many Bishops (who
had described the Condemnation of Athanasius, and therefore no doubt were
Arians) repented and recanted, and so were restored to the Churches Communion,
without the trouble of going to Rome on this Errant.

A Council at Colen follows next, which they say was in Julius his time, and
under Julius; yet the Notes say, they know not the time when it was held, only
the Bishops there assembled deposed a Bishop for Heresy by their own
Authority, without staying for the Pope's Advice, though they were then about
to send a Messenger to Rome to pray for them; so little was the Popes Consent
thought needful in that Age; and perhaps it is in order to conceal this seeming
neglect, that the Notes Bin. Not. p. 463. col. 2.
(after they have approved far more improbable Stories, which make for the
honor of their Church) reject the report of this Message to the Prince of the
Apostles as fabulous, and we are not concerned to vindicate it.

The last Council which they style under Julius, was at Vasatis, or Bazas in
France; yet the Notes affirm, That Nectarius presided in it; the time of it
very uncertain Lab. p. 728. Bin. page 464. col. 1, and 2.
, and the Phrases used in the Canons of it, show it to be of much later date.
Besides this Council says, The Gloria-Patri was sung after the Psalms in all
the Eastern Churches; but Jo. Cassian, who came out of the East in the next
Century, says, He haa never heard this Hymn sung after the Psalms in the
Eastern Churches Bin. Not. in Epist. Damas. and Hieron. page 506. col. 1.
: Wherefore it is probable this Council was celebrated after Cassian's time,
when the Greek Churches had learned this Custom; and yet these Editors place it
a whole Century too soon, because they would have us think that custom here
mentioned, of remembering the Pope in their daily Prayers, was as ancient as the
wrong date here assigned. In Labbe's Edition here is added an account La^^. p.
729. ad page ^^9.
of three Councils against Photinus, on which we need make no Remarks.

An. Dom. 352.
. 23. Pope Liberius succeeded Julius, whose Life with the Notes upon it are
very diverting, if we observe the Shifts and Artifices used by the Roman
Parasites to excuse him from Heresy. The Pontifical says, He was banished
three years by Constantius, for not consenting to the Arians, in whose place
Foelix was Ordained, and he in a Council condemned Ursacius and Valens, two
Arian Bishops, who in Revenge petitioned Constantins to revoke Liberius; and he
being thus restored, consented to the Arians and the Emperor, so far as to
persecute and Martyr the Catholics, and his Rival Foelix being a Catholic, was
deposed. But this Fable is not fine enough for the Palates of Baronius and
Binius, who are to dress a Story to make the Reader believe, that neither
Liberius nor Foelix erred in Faith while they were Popes. To confute which let
it be considered, that Binius confesses, Liberius consented to the depriving
of Athanasius, admitted Arians to his Communion, and subscribed an Arian
Confession of Faith; as Athanasius, Hilary and Hierom, witness Not. ad. 7 Ep.
Liber. Lab page 751. Bin. page 470. col. 1.
; and there are Arguments unanswerable to prove, he was an Arian while he was
Pope Vid. Spalat. de rep. Eccl. l. 7. cap. 5.
; yea, Binius in his own Notes twice confesses, That he unhappily fell Lab. p.
741. Bin. p. 465. E.
; and that, he basely fell Lab. p. 743. Bin. p. 466. col. 2.
. Yet to mince the matter, he adds, That by his Fall he cast a vile Blot on his
Life and Manners; and the Notes on the Sirmian Council say, By offending
against the Confession of Faith, and the Law of Justice, he cast a most base
Blot on his Life and Manners Lab. p. 783. Bin. page 479. col. 2.
. What can be more ridiculous! He erred in Faith, and subscribed the Arian
Confession, therefore the blot was upon his Faith; this did not concern his
Life and Manners. That Absurd Phrase is a mere blind to keep the Reader from
discovering a Pope turning Heretic: To which end they impudently say, It is a
false Calumny of the Heretics to say, Liberius was infected with the Arian
Heresy Lab. p. 741. Bin. page 465. col. 2.
. But I ask, Whether Athanasius, S. Hilary and S. Hierom (who affirm this) were
Heretics? Or was Platina an Heretic, who says, Liberius did in all things
agree with the Heretics: To which the same Forgers have added, [As some would
have it;] but those are not Photinus words, who says soon after, He was of the
same Opinion with the Arians Platin. in vit. Liber. p 50. Eusebius Presbyter
urbis Rome copit declarare Liberium Haereticum. Partitor. Sarish Aug. 14.
. And surely the Catholic People of Rome in his time took him for an Arian, and
as such would have no communion with him, and therefore we conclude he was an
Arian. As for Foelix, who was put into his place, Baronius and Binius would
excuse him by a false Latin Version of Socrates, saying, He was addicted to the
Arian Sect; but the Original Greek expressly declares, He was in Opinion an
Arian (...). Socrat. lib. 2. cap. 29.
. And it is certain, He was chosen by the Arians, and communicated with them,
Ordaining Arians to be Priests; and therefore the Catholic People at Rome
avoided his communion, and S. Hierom says, He was an Arian. As for the Story
of his condemning Ursacius and Valens, two of that Sect, there is no better
Authority for it, than the fabulous Pontifical. So that after all the devices
of Bellarmin, Baronius and Binius Lab. p. 742. Bin. page 466. col. 1, and 2.
, to save their Churches Infallibility, we have two Popes at once falling so
notoriously into the Arian Heresy, that the Lay People disowned their
Communion: This is more than suspicion of Heresy in S. Peter's Chair, and
proves, that their infallible Guides for some years were Arian Heretics.

For this Liberius diverse Epistles are published, with a Preface before them,
which says, Two of them were feigned by the Arians Lab. p. 744. Bin. page 467.
col. 1.
; yet these two are found in the Fragments of S. Hilary, among which it is not
probable there should be any Fiction of the Arians. So that it is very likely
these two Epistles are genuine, but rejected by these Sycophants of Rome,
because they tell an ungrateful Truth, viz. That Liberius did condemn
Athanasius soon after he was made Pope. And if we consider how inconstant he
was, it is very probable that he might condemn Athanasius twice, first in the
beginning of his Papacy, as is said in these two Epistles, of which he
repented, and then writ that Tenth Epistle, to own he was in Communion with
Athanasius, and to tell him, If he approved of his form of Faith, it would tend
much to the settling of his Judgment L^b. p. 755, Bin. p^g 471. col 1.
, which is an odd Complement from an Infallible Head. Secondly. He condemned
Athanasius after his Banishment, of which more shall be said hereafter: But as
to the particular Epistles, we shall note, That in the first (which they say is
genuine) Liberius with other Bishops petition Constantins, to order a Council
to be held at Aquilcia (...). p 744. (...) p^g. 4^7. col. 1. Vid item Ep. 2.
; by which we see the Pope had not then assumed the power of calling Councils.
When he writ the 7th Epistle (which they grant also to be genuine) no doubt he
was an Arian: For he calls the Arian Bishops, His most Beloved Brethren, and
declares his Consent to their just condemning of Athanasius, together with his
being in Communion with them, and his receiving their Sirmian Creed, as the
Catholic Faith Lab. p. 751. ^in. page 469. col. 2.
. So in the XIth Epistle (which is certainly genuine and recorded by Socrates
Socrat. hist. lib. 4. cap. 11.
,) the Notes confess, he was so easy, as to receive the Semi-Arians to
Communion, and to commend their Faith, as the same which was decreed at Nice:
But it is gross Flattery, to call this only, Being too easy; it was in plain
terms, Being d^ceived, and erring in Matters of Faith; which spoils their
Infallibilit Lab. p. 757. Bin. page 472. col. 1.
, as it also does their Universal Supremacy; for Liberius in the same Epistle
to call himself, Bishop of Italy (referring only to the Suburbicarian Regions)
and saying, He was the meaness of Bishops, and rejoiced that those in the East
did (not submit to him, but) agree with him in Matters of Faith. Wherefore the
XIIth or (as Labbe calls it) the XIVth Epistle, which is writ to all Bishops,
is manifestly forged Ep. 14. Lab. page 760. Ep. 12. Bin. page 472. col. 2.
: And so are the two next, from Liberius to Athanasius, and from Athanasius to
Liberius, as both Labbe and Binius confess Lab. p. 763. Bin. in Notis page 474.
col. 2.
; yet in one of these the Pope brags of his Authority over the Universal
Church: But the Forger was so bad at Chronology, that while he strives to make
this Pope look like an Orthodox Friend of Athanasius, he absurdly brings him
in, even under Julian or Valens (in one of whose Reigns this Epistle was
written,) threatening Offenders with the Emperors Indignation, with
Deprivation, yea, with Proscription, Banishment and Stripes Lab. p. 767. Bin.
page 474. col. 2.
. I need not mention those Decrees which are attributed to Liberius, whose
Style betrays them, and shows they belong to the later Ages, and are placed
here by the Collectors, only to make them seem more ancient than really they
are.

In Liberius's first year it is said, There was a Council called at Rome by
this Pope, to clear Athanasius Lab. p. 769. (...). page 475. col. 1.
; yet being sensible that their Authority would signify very little, they all
agreed to petition the Emperor for a Council to Meet at Aquil^^a, to confirm
what they had done at Rome. Anno 355. there was a Council at Milan, the Editors
call it, A General Council, because it was with Constantins permission, called
by Liberius, whose Legates also were present at it Lab p. ^^2. Bin. page 476.
col. 1.
. But herein they grossly falsify, for Sozomen declares, That Constantius
summ^ned all the Bishops to Milan S^^^m. lib. 4 cap. 8. Socrat. lib. 2. cap. 29.
; and Barenius says, The Emperor called them together Baron. An. 355. 2.
. Therefore if this was a General Council, it was called by the Emperor, and
not by the Pope: In the Notes on this Synod they say, Constantius being yet a
Catechumen, ought not to be present at a lawful Council. But this is Baronius
his device, to color over the Forgery of Constantine's Baptism before the
Council of Nice, there being no Canon forbidding a Catechumen to be present in
a Council, or in a Church, except only while the Sacrament was celebrating; so
that if Constantius had been bound by an Ecclesiastical Canon, there being no
Canon to hinder his presence in this Council, Barenius assigns a wrong cause of
his absence. Again, the Notes do very falsely suppose, That Foelix, though
chosen by the Arians, was a Catholic Pope Lab. p. 773.
: For he was Ordained by three Arian Bishops at Milan, as Athanasius declares
Athanas. Epist. ad Solitar.
; and Socrates, as we noted before, says, He was in Opinion an Arian. Nor is
it probable, when the Arians had got Liberius banished, for not complying with
them, they should choose a Catholic and an Enemy into so eminent a See; or that
the Catholic People of Rome should avoid the communion of Foelix, if he were
not an Arian. It Is true, Sozomen speaks of some who said, He kept to the Nicene
Faith, and was unblameable in Religion; yet he adds, -- he was accused for
ordaining Arians, and communicating with them Sozom. lib. 4. cap. 10.
. But this bare Report, raised perhaps by the Arians (who still pretended to be
Catholics, and hold the Nicene Faith) cannot outweigh such strong Reason and
Matters of Fact, as are here alleged to prove Foelix, not only a Schismatical,
but also an Heretical Pope.

The Dialogue between Constantius and Pope Liberius at Milan, (here published)
shows, That at this time he refused either to condemn Athanasius, or
communicate with the Arians, and was banished into Thrace for this refusal: But
the Reader may justly wonder he should never mention his Supremacy and
Universal Authority, when Constantius asked him, If he were so considerable a
part of the World, that he would alone stand for Athanasius; and when he
advised him, to embrace the Communion of the Churches Lab. p. 775. Bin. page
478. col. 1.
, how properly might he have here told him, he was Head of all Churches, and
those who did not communicate with him were no Churches? Again, Why does this
Pope offer to go to Alexandria, and hear Athanasius's cause there, which had
been twice judged at Rome? Surely he knew nothing of these last and highest
Appeals in all Causes: The Popes of after-Ages claimed this as a right of their
See; yet it must be granted, that Liberius was ignorant of that privilege.

24. The Council at Sirmium was called by Constantius, and consisted of Arian
Bishops, An. Dom. 357.
who though they condemned Photinus his gross Heresy, yet would not put the
word Consubstantial into any of the three Creeds, which they here composed,
however the Editors call it, A General Council partly rejected: Perhaps,
because Pope Liberius approved it, who here openly Fell into the Arian Heresy;
and that, not by constraint (as the Notes pretend Lab. p. 783. Bin. page 479.
col. 2.
)): For out of his Banishment he writ to the Eastern Bishops, assuring them he
had condemned Athanasius, and would communicate with them in their form of
Faith, and therefore he desired them to intercede for his release and
restitution to his Bishopric. The ambition of regaining which great place was
the cause of his Fall Baron. An. 357.. 33, 34, and 35.
, as Baronius confesses; and though that Author had produced diverse Ancient
Writers expressly testifying, That he subscribed Heresy Baron. ibid.. 32.
. Yet a little after he again denies, that Liberius was an Heretic; pretending,
that he only signed the first Confession of Sirmium, which was not downright
Heresy Id. ibid. 37.
. Though elsewhere he says, Athanasius rejected all these Arian Forms (which
wanted, Consubstantial) as Heretical Baron. An. 359.. 10.
, and declares that the Catholic People of Rome esteemed Liberius to be an
Heretic, and would not have Communion with him, for which he cruelly persecuted
them. Nay, he brags of it as a singular Providence, that Foelix (who was a
Schismatical Pope in his Exile) upon Liberius's Fall, suddenly became a
Catholic and a lawful Pope, which still supposes Liberius was an Heretic, as
does also Baronius his Fiction of Liberius's speedy Repentance, and Foelix his
dying soon after his Adversaries return to Rome: For the Writers of that Age
say, Foelix lived eight years after Marcelin. ad Faust. and Hieron. Chronic.
; and for Liberius his Repentance, though many Authors expressly speak of his
falling into Heresy, none are very clear in his returning, or however, none
suppose it to be so long before his Death, as Baronius does; whose design in
this History is not to serve Truth, but to clear S. Peter's Chair from the
imputation of Heresy, and therefore he makes this out chiefly by Conjectures
Baron. An. 357.. 59. -- ad --. 63.
. The testimonies of Damasus and Siricius being parties and partial for the
honor of their own See, are no good Evidence if they did speak of his early
Repentance; but Damasus only says, The Bishop of Rome did not consent to the
Faith of Ariminum: Baronius adds, This was Liberius. I reply, That Damasus was
of Foelix his party, before his own advancement to be Pope, and so it is more
probable that he meant Foelix. Again, the Catholic Bishop's Letter from
Ariminum only says, The Arian Decrees created discord at Rome Sozom. lib. 4.
cap. 17.
; that is, there were then two Factions there, one of which (and probably that
of Liberius) did agree to these Decrees, the other rejected them. Baronius adds
to the Bishops Letter, -- these Decrees created Factions, because the Pope of
Rome opposed them: But this will not clear Liberius, since both Factions were
headed by a Pope. Baronius goes on to tell us, that Sozomen affirms, Liberius
was turned out of his Church, for not consenting to the Faith at Ariminum Id.
cap. 18.
. I Answer, Sozomen must be mistaken in this, unless we seign a double Exile of
Liberius, which no good Author mentions, and which Baronius will not allow. As
for the Epistle of Liberius to Athanasius, it was writ no doubt before he had
condemned him, or else he ought to have confessed his Fault, as well as his
Faith to that great Man. I grant Socrates does say, That Liberius required the
Semi-Arians and Macedonians, to consent to the Nicene Faith in the time of
Valens Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 11.
; but this was Nine years after his return, and not long before his Death, yet
then Liberius was imposed on in Matters of Faith by these Bishops, whom he
calls Orthodox; for they were still Heretical, and did not heartily agree to
the Nicene Faith, so that his Infallibility was deceived: And though S. Ambrose
call Liberius [Of happy Memory] where he cites a Sermon of his; that is a
Phrase which the Primitive Charity used of some Men not altogether Orthodox
Vid. Baron. Andal. An 362. page 58. and An. 371. p. 246.
: But it is a great prejudice to Liberius his Repentance, that though
Athanasius speak of him as having been once his Friend, and report his
Apostasy, yet he never mentions his turning Catholic again. Wherefore we
conclude, that all these Fictions, and falsifying of Evidence and slight
Conjectures in Baronius and the Notes, are intended only to blind the Reader,
and hinder his finding out an Heretical Pope, whose Fall is clear, his
continuance in his Heresy very probable, and his Repentance (if it be true)
came too late to save his Churches Infallibility, though it might be soon
enough to save his own Soul.

The Editors style the Council at Ariminum, An. Dom. 359.
A General Council, and yet dare not say, as usually, under Liberius, who had
no hand in it, for it was called by the Emperor Constantius, as all Writers
agree Sulpic. Sever. histor. lib. 2.
; so that it seems there may be A General approved Council (as they style this
Lab. p. 792. Bin. page 482. col. 1.
, which the Pope does not call. Moreover, the Emperor in his first Epistle
orders the Bishops to send him their Decrees, that he might confirm them Lab.
p. 794. Bin. page 482. col. 2.
; and though Baronius says this was done like an Heretical Emperor, yet the
Orthodox Bishops observed his Order, and call it, Obeying the Command of God,
and his Pious Edict Baron. An. 352.. 6. and. 15.
: Wherefore this General Council was both called and confirmed by the Emperor.
Again, Constantins in his Epistle declares, It was unreasonable to determine
any thing in a Western Council against the Eastern Bishops. Whence it appears,
he knew nothing of the Western Patriarchs claiming an Universal Supremacy over
all the Churches, both of the East and West; and for this Reason Baronius
leaves this genuine Epistle (recorded in S. Hilary's Fragments) out of his
Annals: We have also noted before, that though the Orthodox Bishops in this
Council (who must know the matter) say, That Constantine was Baptized after the
Council at Nice, and soon after his Baptism translated to his deserved Rest; as
the Ancient Historians read that Passage, and the Sense of the place shows they
could mean it of none but Constantine Theod. lib. 2. cap. 19. Sozom. lib. 4
cap. 17. collat. cum Baron. An. 350.. 7.
; yet Baronius corrupts the Text, and reads Constans instead of Constantine,
only to support the Fable of Constantine's being Baptized by Sylvester at Rome,
and the Editors follow him in that gross Corruption: For they examine nothing
which serves the Interest of Rome. As for the Arian Synods this year at
Seleucia and Constantinople, I need make no Remarks on them, because the Pope
is not named in them, and so there is no occasion for them to feign any thing.
Only one Forgery of Baronius must not be passed over: That when Cyril of
Jerusalem was deposed by an Arian Synod, he is said to have appealed to
greater Judges, and yet he never named the Pope; the reason of which ( Baronius
says) was, because the True Pope Liberius was then in Banishment Baron. An.
359. 65.
; but has he not often asserted Foelix was a Catholic, and if Cyril had
thought fit, might he not have appealed to him? But it is plain by Socrates,
that Cyril meant to appeal to the Emperor and his Delegates, as all injured
Bishops in that Age had used to do.

An. Dom. 362.
. 25. Upon the restitution of Athanasius from his third Exile after the death
of George the Arian Bishop, he called a Council of Bishops at Alexandria, for
deciding some differences among the Catholics about the manner of explaining
the Trinity, and to agree on what terms Recanting Arians were to be received
into the Church. And though neither Athanasius, nor any ancient Historian take
any notice of the Pope in this eminent Action; yet the Editors our of Baronius
say, It was called by the Advice and Authority of Liberius Lab. p. 809. Bin.
page 487. col. 1. Baron. An. 362. Page 73.
; and to make out the notorious Fiction of this Popes calling this Orthodox
Council (even while he was an Arian) the Notes affirm, Eusebius Bishop of
Vercelles and Lucifer Calaritanus, as the Popes Legates were present at it;
which they take out of Baronius, who had before told us, That Luciser
Calaritanus was at that time at Antioch, and sent two Deacons to Alexandria to
subscribe for him; yea, this Synod writes their Synodical Letter to Eusebius,
Lucifer and other Bishops, which plainly shows they were absent; though it
seems by Ruffinus, that Eusebius came afterward, and subscribed to what had
been agreed in the Council, and was by the Authority of this Council (not of
the Pope) sent into the East to procure peace among those Churches: Nor have
they any one Author to prove either he or Lucifer were the Pope's Legates, nor
any reason, but because they were employed in great Actions, though in that Age
('it is plain) the Popes were little concerned in any eminent business. Moreover,
they bring in a Fragment of an Epistle, writ (according to the Ancient Custom)
by Liberius at his Entrance into the Sea of Rome, to show his Faith to
Athanasius, as if it were written now, merely to impose on the Reader a false
Notion of his being at this time Orthodox, and concerned in this Synod. They
also cite another Epistle of Athanasius, to certify Liberius what was done
here; but that Epistle is no where extant in Athanasius's Works, but is cited
out of the Acts of the second Nicene Council, where there are more Forgeries
than genuine Tracts quoted; and besides, the Epistle is directed not to the
Pope, but to one Ruffinianus, and only mentions the Roman Churches approving
what was done here; but the Epistle being suspicious, it is no good Evidence,
and we conclude with Nazianzen, That Athanasius in this Synod gave Laws to the
whole World Baron. An. 362. Tom. IV. p. 66.
: And Pope Liberius had no hand in it.

About this time there were diverse Councils called in France by S. Hilary
Bishop of Poictiers, and the Catholic Faith was settled in them, one of which
was held at Paris, and the Synodical Epistle is extant Lab. p. 821. Bin page
490. col. 1.
; yet the Pope is never named in it. Nor yet in that Orthodox Synod at
Alexandria, wherein Athanasius and his Suffragan Bishops presented a Confession
of their Faith to Jovian, then newly made Emperor Lab. p. 823. Bin. page 490.
col. 2.
, which shows, that Liberius either was an Heretic at this time, or else that
he was very inconsiderable: So that it is a strange Arrogance in the Editors to
say, that the Second Council at Antioch was under Liberius Lab. p. 826. Bin. p.
491. col. 1.
, when the very Notes say, it was called together by Meletius, and observe,
that many Arian Bishops did there recant their Heresy; a thing, which a little
before they pretended could be done no where but at Rome, in the Popes Presence.

An. Dom. 365.
Upon Valentinian's advancement to the Empire, the Eastern Bishops petition him
to call a Council, and he (being then very busy) told them, they might call it
where they pleased: Which the Editors pretend was a declining to meddle in
Church Affairs, being a Layman: But the Bishops Petition, and his giving them
liberty, shows, that the right of calling Councils was in him, and so was also
the confirming them, as appears from the Bishops sending the Acts of this
Council (at Lampsacus) to the Emperor Valens to be confirmed Soz^m. lib. 6.
cap. 7.
. The same Bishops also sent their Legates with Letters to the Western Bishops,
and particularly to Liberius Bishop of Rome, hoping Valentinian the other
Emperor had been in that City; but he being absent, these Legates, persuaded
Liberius they were Orthodox; upon which he writ back Letters in his own Name,
and in the Name of the other Western Bishops, to own them for good Catholics
Socrat. hist. lib. 4. cap. 11.
. Whence we may note, First, That the Eastern Bishop's Letter styles the Pope
no more but Colleague and Brother. Secondly, That Liberius calls himself only
Bishop of Italy, Liberius Ep. Italiae, and alii Occidentis Episcopi: But
Baronius alters the Pointing, Liberius Episcopus, Italiae and alii, etc. by
that Trick, hoping to conceal this mean Title Ep. 11. Liberti ap. Bin. p. 472.
Baron. An. 365. page 153.
. Thirdly, The Pope here says, He was the least of all Bishops, and was glad
their Opinion agreed with his and the rest of the Western Bishops. Fourthly,
Yet after all these very Eastern Bishops were of the Macedonian party, as the
Title of their Letter in Socrates shows Socrat. ut supr.
. Baronius indeed leaves these words out of the Title, but he confesses they
were Semi-Arians: So that the Popes Infallibility, (as being imposed on by
Heretics in Mattets of Faith) loses more by this Embassy, than his Supremacy
gains by it, because the Legates were not sent to him alone, but to all the
Western Bishops. Fifthly, The Notes on this Council Lab. p. 830. Bin. page 492.
col. 1.
feign, that besides these Communicatory Letters, Liberius writ other Letters,
Commanding that ejected Bishops should be restored by the Apostolic Authority:
But this is one of Baronius his Forgeries Baron. An. 365. page 154.
. For S. Basil, and also Sozomen, cited by the Notes on the Council of Tyana
Lab. p. 836. Bin. page 494. col. 1.
, mention not the Legates showing any other Letters at their return into the
East, but only the Communicatory Letters; and since it appeared by them, that
the Western Bishops judged them Orthodox, their Eastern Brethren did restore
them: And so also these Legates got the approbation of a Council in Sicily, as
they were returning home; for the Sicilian Bishops by mistake took them for
Orthodox, when they saw the rest of the Western Bishops owned their Communion
with them, and so approved their Confession of Faith; and therefore it is very
impertinent in the Notes to say on this occasion Council. Siciliae, Lab. and
Bin. ut supr.
, That the Authority of the Pope was so great, that if he admitted even
suspected Heretics to his Communion, none presumed to reject them. Whereas we
know that afterward, the People of Rome rejected even the Pope himself, for
communicating with Semi-Arians.

The next thing which occurs is a Synod in Illyricum, Convened at the request
of Eusebius Bishop of Sebastia, one of the Eastern Legates, who (while his
Fellows stayed at Rome) went into that Country, and prevailed with the Bishops
assembled there, to send Elpidius a Brother and Colleague of their own, with a
Synodical Letter to the Eastern Bishops; declaring, they would communicate with
them, if their Faith was the same with that of Nice. Now though this Synod do
not mention the Pope, yet Baronius and the Notes feign, That Elpidius was the
Pope's Legate Lab. p. 832. Bin. page 493. Baron. An. 365. page 155.
; whereas the Synod, the Emperors Letter, and Theodoret (from whom this Story
is taken) mention Elpidius only as a Messenger sent from this Council.

When these Eastern Legates returned home, there was a Council called at Tyana
in Cappadocia Lab. p. 836. Bin. page 494. col. 1.
, wherein they showed the Communicatory Letters which they had fraudulently
obtained in the West; upon which Letters, those who had been ejected as
Heretics, and particularly Eustathius of Sebastia, were restored to their Sees;
but neither Sozomen nor S. Basil say, this was done by any special Letters of
Liberius, or by any Command of his; yet if it had been so, this would spoil
this Popes Infallibility, it being certain these restored Bishops were
Heretics, who Liberius, poor Man! thought to be good Catholics, and he has the
more to answer for, if this were done not by his Consent alone, but by his
Command also.

After this we have the Life of Pope Foelix, about whom they differ so much,
that nothing is plain in his Story, but this, that little of him is certainly
known. The Pontifical in Liberius Life says, He died in peace; but here it
says, He was Martyred by Constantius, for declaring him an Heretic, and one
who was rebaptized by Eusebius of Nicomedia: Yet Constantius was not Baptized
at all till after Foelix his pretended Martyrdom, and he was Baptized then (not
by Eusebius, but) by one Euzoius. Again, The Pontifical allows him but to sit
One year and three months, and the Notes say, This is right, computing from
Liberius Fall to his Return; which (as Sozomen affirms) was but little before
Foelix his Death Lab. p. 843. Bin. page 490. col. 2.
: Whereas these very Notes tell us, a little before, that Liberius was above
two years in Exile Lab. p. 742. Bin. page 466. col. 1.
; therefore if he lived but a small time after Liberius's return, he must sit
above two years: But Marcellinus (who writ in that Age) tells us, Foelix lived
eight years after Liberius was restored; Which Baronius and the Notes would
conceal, to hide the Scandal that their Church must get by a long Schism, and
by an Heretical Pope, of whom they will needs make a Martyr, only upon the
Credit of the Pontifical, and a modern fallacious Inscription, pretended to be
found at Rome many Ages after, belonging to some Foelix, but which of them they
know not.

The Epistles ascribed to this Pope contain so many and so gross Untruths, that
Labbe notes, They are discarded by Baronius and other Learned Men, as Isidores
Wares Lab. Marg. p. 844, and 849.
; adding, That the third Epistle was stolen from Pope Martin the First, in his
Lateran Council Id. Marg. page 856.
. And though Binius very often cite the two first Epistles, yet in his Notes on
them he owns, they are of no credit Lab. p. 849. Bin. page 499. col. 1.
: For they Forge many Canons as made at Nice, and tell that idle story of the
true Copies of the Nicene Canons being burnt by the Arians Richer. hist. Con
lib. 1. cap. 1.. 9.
. But it is certain the Forger of these Epistles was a Creature of the Popes,
because the Inscriptions of them are stuffed with false and flattering Titles,
and the Body of them nauseously and ridiculously press the Supremacy, and the
Universal Empire of the Roman Church.

. 26. The entrance of Damasus into the Papacy was not without Blood, An. Dom.
367.
for the People were divided, and some standing for Damasus, others for
Ursicinus, Damasus his Party being stronger, slew many of their Adversaries in
a Church, as all the Writers of that Age testify Am. Marcel. lib. 17. Ruffin.
lib. 2. cap. 10. Hieron. in Chron.
; and though Ammianus be a Pagan Historian, yet it is very probable which he
writes, that it was not Zeal, but the ambition of living high and great, that
made Men contend so fiercely for the Papacy; for S. Basil himself about this
time taxes the Roman Church with Pride; and S. Hierom, the great Friend of that
Church, often reflects upon the pomp and luxury of the Clergy there: So that
the Notes on Damasus his Life do but glory in their Churches shame, when from
these Authors they boast of the Magnificence and Majesty of the Papacy Lab. p.
860. Bin. page 503. col. 2.
. The Fabulous Pontifical was for many Ages pretended to be writ by this
Damasus, and he who forged the Decretal Epistles, invented one to Aurelius
Bishop of Carthage Lab. p. 862. Bin. page 503. col. 2.
; wherein Damasus is feigned to send him (at his Request) all the Epistles writ
by the Popes from S. Peter, to his time, and this of old was the Preface to the
Decretal Epistles; but the Forgery is so gross that Binius rejects it, and if
his affection for the Papacy had not biassed him, he would also have rejected
all the Epistles, which are as errant Forgeries as this Preface. The first and
second Epistles written in Damasus his Name to Paulinus, and the Eastern
Bishops, are suspicious The third Epistle of Damasus to Hierom is evidently
Forged by some illiterate Monk; but S. Hierom's Answer seems to be genuine; yet
the Notes reject it Lab. p. 868. Bin. page 506. col. 1.
for no other reason, but because it truly supposes the Pope and his Clergy
were so ignorant, as to need S. Hierom's help to make them understand the
Psalms, and affirms, that Rome obeyed his directions in singing the Psalms, and
adding the Gloria Patri to them; whereas whoever considers the Learning and
Authority of S. Hierom in that Age, will not think it at all improbable, that
he should teach the Roman Bishop. And Binius is forced to cite this Epistle
wrong in his Notes, to get a seeming Argument against it; for the Epistle does
not advise them to sing the Gloria Patri after the manner of the East (as he
quotes it;) but to sing it, to show their Consent to the Nicene Faith. The
fourth Epistle of Damasus, to Stephen Archbishop of the Council of Mauritania,
with Stephen's Epistle to him, are owned by Labbe to be both spurious Lab.
Marg. page 869. Bin. page 506, etc.
. But since they magnify the Popes Supremacy, Binius justifies them both; for
whose confutation let it be noted, 1. That it is absurd to style a Man
Archbishop of a Council: Secondly, That in this Epistle is quoted a forged
Epistle of Foelix, owned by Binius himself to be spurious Bin. p. 499.
: Thirdly, That place of Math. XVI. is falsely quoted here, and thus read, Thou
art Peter, and upon thy foundation will I set the Pillars (that is, the
Bishops) of the Church: Fourthly, The later of them is dated with Flavius and
Stillico, who were not Consuls till Damasus had been in his Grave full twenty
year, as Labbe confesses; wherefore we justly discard these gross Forgeries
devised of old, and defended now only to support the Popes usurped Power. The
fifth Epistle says, The Institution of the Chorepiscopi was very wicked and
extreme evil; yet presently after it owns, they were appointed in imitation of
the LXX Disciples, and were at first necessary for the Primitive Church; it is
also dated with Libius and Theodosius, who were never Consuls in Damasus's
time, and finally Labbe owns, that much of it is stolen out of the Epistles of
later Popes Lab. p. 876. Bin. page 509. col. 1.
; yet Binius will not reject it, because it has some kind touches for the
Supremacy. The sixth Epistle to the Bishops of Illyricum passes Muster also
with him, though it be dated with Siricius and Ardaburus, who were Consuls till
30 years after Damasus was dead Lab. p. 882. Bin. page 511. col. 1.
. The 7th Epistle is dated with the same Consuls; yet Binius allows of it,
because in it the Pope pretends to give Laws not only to Italy, but to all the
World, though Labbe confess the Cheat, and owns it was stolen by Isidore out
of Leo's 47th Epistle Lab. p. 883. Bin. page 511. col. 2.
So unfortunate is their Supremacy, that whatever seems to give any countenance
to it, always proves to be Forged. The Decrees attributed to this Pope seem to
have been the invention of later Ages; for it is not probable Damasus would
have Fathered a Lie upon the Nicene Council, in saying, It was decreed there,
that Laymen should not meddle with Oblations Lab. p. 885. Bin. page 512. col.
1.
; or that he would say, Such as broke the Canons, were guilty of the Sin
against the Holy Ghost: Nor does his Decree about the Pall agree to this Age.
So that Damasus's Name has for better credit been clapped to these Decrees by
the modern Compilers, who are the Guides to our Editors.

About this time the Arians having the Emperor Valens on their side, began to
grow bold; An. Dom. 369.
but Athanasius condemned them in Egypt by diverse Synods, and upon his
Admonition Damasus held two Synods at Rome, in the first of which, Ursacius and
Valens, two Arian Bishops were condemned, and in the later, Auxentius the Arian
Bishop of Milan was deposed; not by the Popes single Authority, as the Notes
and Baronius vainly pretend Bin. p. 512. and 513. Baron. An. 369. page 190, etc.
, but by the common Suffrage of Ninety Bishops assembled with him, as the words
of Athanasius, and the very Councils Letter plainly show. And though Baronius
here talks of the Popes sole Privilege in deposing Bishops, there are
innumerable Instances of Bishops deposed without the Popes leave or knowledge;
and Auxentius valued and believed Damasus his Authority so little, that
notwithstanding this Sentence of the Pope in Council, he kept his Bishopric
till his Death.

An. Dom. 373.
Apollinaris having disseminated his Heresy at Antioch, complaint was made ^o
Damasus of one Vitalis who held those Errors; but the Pope (who had not the
gift of discerning the Spirits) was imposed on by his subscribing a plausible
Confession of Faith, so that he writ on his behalf to Paulinus Bishop of
Anti^ch Baron. An. 373. page 301.
. It Is true, at the request of S. Basil, Damasus did this year join with Peter,
Bishop of Alexandria (who was then at Rome) in condemning Apollinaris in a
Roman Council Lab. p. 895. Bin. page 514. col. 1.
; but Nazianzen says, He did not this till he was better instructed in the
Points: For at first (as the Notes confess) this Pope took Apollinaris for a
pi^us and learned Man; and so held Communion with him till he understood by S.
Basil 's third Epistle, that he was an Heretic. I know they excuse this by
saying, that S. Basil himself, and Nazianzen and S. Hierom were all at first
under the same m^stake with Damasus: But then none of these ever were pretended
to be Infallible Judges in matters of Faith, as Baronius holds Damasus was; so
that the mistake in them is pardonable, but upon Baronius Principles I see not
how Damasus his Infallibility can be secured, when he was so long deceived by a
Heretic, and was forced to be instructed by a private Bishop at last, even in
cases of Heresy.

The next year a Council was held at Valentia in Dauphine, the true Title of
which says, it was under Gratian and Valentinian (the Emperors;) but the
Editors put a new Title over it, and say it was under Damasus Lab. p. 904. Bin.
page 516. col. 1.
, who is not once named in it; the French Bishops there assembled making Canons
for their own Churches, without asking the Popes leave, or desiring his
Confirmation.

An. Dom. 378.
Upon the death of Valens the Arian Emperor, while Valentinian was yet very
young, Gratian managed both the Eastern and Western Empire, and he makes a Law
to suppress all Heresies, and to take away the use of Churches from all such as
were not in Communion with Damasus Bishop of Rome, and Peter of Alexandria
Sozom. lib. ^. cap. 4. Socrat lib. 5. cap. 2.
. Theodoret indeed (who as Baronius owns is much mistaken in his relating this
matter Theod. lib. 5. cap. 2. and Baron. An. 378. page 339.
) names only Damasus in his report of this Law; and B^ronius cites the Law out
of him, merely to make it seem as if Damasus were made the sole Standard of
Catholic Communion, though the Original Law still extant God. Justin. lib. 1.
tit. 1. de sum. Trin. Ll. 1.
, and all other Historians, name Peter of Alexandria as equal with Damasus:
perhaps the Reader may wonder there is no other Patriarch named in this Law;
but it must be observed, that Anti^ch at this time had two Orthodox Bishops,
who separated from each other, Meletius and Paulinus, to make up which unhappy
Schism there was a Synod this year held at Antioch, under Damasus Lab. p. 908.
Bin. page 517. col. 1.
, say the Editors; but in truth, under the Emperors Legate, who was sent to
see a Peace concluded between these two Bishops by the advice of the Council
there assembled: And Damasus had so little interest in this Council, that
Meletius was generally approved for the true Bishop, and Paulinus (whose party
the Pope favored) ordered only to come in after Meletius his Death Socrat.
lib. 5. cap. 5. Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 3. Theod. lib. 5. c. 3.
: So that since this Council acted contrary to the mind of Damasus, it is very
improper to say, it was held under him.

. 27. The second General Council at Constantinople was Called by the Emperor
Theodosius, An. Dom. 381.
whom Gratian had taken for his Partner in the Empire, and assigned him for his
share the Eastern Provinces; where this pious Prince finding great differences
in Religion, he Convened this Council to confirm the Nicene Faith, to settle
Ecclesiastical Matters, and to determine the Affairs of the Sea of
Constantinople. This Council the Editors introduce with a Preface or general
History, and conclude it with partial and false Notes, hoping to persuade the
World, that it was both called and (...) all the good things which they had
done; with which Letter probably they sent (as was usual) a Transcript of all
their Acts: And Photius says, That Damasus, Bishop of Rome afterward agreed
with these Bishops, and confirmed what they had done Photius de 7 Synod. cap. 2.
; that is, by consenting to it, which is no more than every absent Bishop may
do, who in a large Sense may be said to confirm a Council, when he agrees to
the Acts of it after they are brought to him.

Thirdly, The Authority of this Council is undoubted, having been ever called
and accounted the Second General Council, and so it is reckoned in all places
where the General Councils are mentioned, which Title it had not, as Bellarmin
vainly suggests, Because at the time when this was assembled in the East, the
Western Bishops met at Rome: For that obscure Synod is not taken notice of,
while this is every where celebrated, as held at Constantinople, and consisting
of one hundred and fifty Bishops, which were they who met in the East Lab. p.
967. Bin. page 541. col. 2.
. As for Damasus, Baronius cannot prove he was concerned in it, but by we
think, and we may believe Baron. An. 380 p 359. and An. 381. p. 368.
; yet he elsewhere boldly says, Damasus gave it Supreme Authority Idem p. 382.
; and the Annotator makes it impossible for any Council to be general, unless
the Pope or his Legates be there. Now he and all others call this A General
Council: And yet he says, That neither Pope Damasus, nor his Legates were
Presidents of it, nor was he or any Western Bishop in it. Whence we learn, That
there may be a General Council, at which the Pope is not present, by himself,
nor by his Legates, and of which neither he nor they are Presidents.

Fourthly, As to the Creed and Canons here made, the modern Romanists without
any proof suppose, that Damasus allowed the former, and not the later: But if
he allowed the famous Creed here made, I ask, Whether it then had these words
[And from the Son] or no? If it had, why do the Notes say, That these words
were added to it by the Bishops of Spain and the Authority of Pope Leo long
after Lab. p. 972. Bin. page 543. col. 2.
? But if these words were wanting, as they seem to confess, (when they say, The
Roman Church long used this Creed without this addition) then I must desire to
know, how a Man of their Church can be secure of his Faith, if what was (as
they say) confirmed by Damasus in a General Council, may be al ered by a few
Bishops and another Pope, without any General Council? As to the Canons,
Damasus made no objection against them in his time, and it is very certain that
the Bishop of Constantinople after this Council, always had the second place.
For as the first General Council at Nice gave old Rome the first place, as
being the Imperial City; so this second General Council doubted not, but when
Constantinople was become new Rome, and an Imperial City also; they had power
to give it the second place, and suitable Privileges. Yea, the Notes confess,
that S. Chrysostem, by virtue of this Canon, placed and displaced diverse
Bishops in Asia, and the 4th General Council at Chalc^den (without regarding
the dissent of the Popes Legates) allowed the Bishop of Constantinople the
second place, and made his Privileges equal to those of Old Rome Vid. Council.
Chaleed. Can. 28. and Subscrip. ibid.
; which Precedence and Power that Bishop long returned, notwithstanding the
endeavors of the envious Popes: And Gregory never objected against th^se
Canons, till he began to fear the growing Greatness of the Patriarch of
Constantinople; but when that Church and Empire was sinking, and there appeared
no danger on that side to the Popes, then Innocent the Third is said by the
Notes, to revive and allow this Canon again; by which we see, that nothing but
Interest governs that Church, and guides her Bishops in allowing or discarding
any Council: For now again, when the Reformed begin to urge this Canon,
Baronius and the Notes say, They can prove by firm Reasons, that this Canon was
forged by the Greeks: But their Reasons are very frivolous, They say Anatolius
did not quote this Canon against Pope Leo: I reply, It Is very probable he did,
because Leo says, He pleaded the Consent of many Bishops; that is, (if Leo
would have spoken out) In this General Council. Secondly, They urge that this
Canon is not mentioned in the Letter writ to Damasus. I Answer, They have told
us before, they sent their Acts to him, and so need not repent them in this
Letter. Thirdly, They talk of the Injury done to Timotheus Bishop of
Alexandria; but his Subscription is put to the Canons as well as the Creed, and
it does not appear that ever he or any of his Successors contended for
Precedence after this, with the Patriarch of Constantinople: And that the
Modern Greeks did not forge this Canon is plain, because Socrates and Sozomen
both mention it Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 2. Sozom. lib 7. cap. 8.
; and the Catholic Church always owned it for Authentic. Yea, in the Council of
Chalcedon it is declared, That the Bishop of Constantinople ought to have had
the second place in the Factious Synod at Ephesus, and he is reckoned in that
fourth General Council next after the Pope, whose Legates were there, and yet
durst not deny him the second place, in which he sat and subscribed in that
order, having first had this Canon confirmed at Chalcedon: So that all
Churches, but that of Rome, submit to this General Council; and they who
pretend most to venerate them, do despise and reject the Authority of General
Councils, if they oppose the ends of their Pride and Avarice. To conclude, Here
is a General Council called and confirmed only by the Emperor, assembled
without the Pope or his Legates, decreeing Matters of Faith and of Discipline,
yet every where owned and received as genuine, except at Rome, when Interest
made them partial, and still no less valued for that by all other Churches:
Which gives a severe Blow to the modern Pretenses of their Papal Supremacy and
Infallibility.

The same Year there was a Council at Aquileia in Italy, wherein diverse Arians
were fully heard and fairly condemned. Now this Council was called by the
Emperor, the Presidents of it being Valerian Bishop of Aquileia, and Ambrose
Bishop of Milan; but Damasus is not named in it, nor was he present at it in
Person, or by his Legates, though this Council was called in Italy it self, and
designed to settle a Point of Faith: But these Bishops (as the Acts show) did
not judge Heretics by the Popes Authority, but by Scripture and by solid
Arguments: And they tell us, It was then a Custom for the Eastern Bishops to
hold their Councils in the East, and the Western theirs in the West Lab. p.
980. Bin. page 545 col. 2.
; which argues, they knew of no Universal Monarchy, vested in the Pope, and
giving him power over all the Bishops, both of the East and West. For it was
not Damasus, but the Prefect of Italy, who writ about this Synod to the Bishops
of the East Baron. An. 381. page 386.
: Nor did this Council write to the Pope, but to the Emperor, to confirm their
Sentence against Heretics; wherefore Damasus had a limited Authority in those
days, not reaching so much as over all Italy, and extended only to the
Suburbicarian Regions, out of which, as being Damasus's peculiar Province,
Ursicinus his Antagonist for the Papacy, was banished by the Emperor
Valentinian Baron. An. 371. page 235.
; and therefore Sulpicius Severus calls him not Orbis, but Urbis Episcopus
Sulpic. Sever. page 423.
, the Bishop of the City, not of the World; and speaking of Italy, he says in
the next Page, That the Supreme Authority at that time was in Damasus, and S.
Ambrose Id. page 424.
. To these two therefore the Priscillian Heretics applied themselves, when they
were condemned by the Council of Caesar-Augusta, or Saragosa in Spain, in which
Country the Sect first began; but when they could not get these great Bishops
to favor their Cause, they corrupted the Emperors Ministers, to procure a
Rescript for their restitution Lab. p. 1011. Bin. page 554 col. 1.
. Now it is strange that this Council of Saragosa should bear the Title of
[under Damasus,] and that the Notes should affirm, Sulpicius Severus plainly
writes thus: For if we read Sulpicius as above cited, we shall find that
Damasus knew nothing of this Synod till long after it was risen; so we may
conclude this Invention of theirs is only to support their pretended Supremacy.

An Dom. 382.
. 28. From a Passage in S. Hierom, and the Inscription of the Letter writ from
the Council at Constantinople, the Editors gather, That Paulinus Bishop of
Antioch, Epiphanius Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, and Ambrose, with other of
the Western Bishops, met at Rome in Council this year, which they call the
Fourth Roman Council under Damasus Lab. p. 1014. Bin. page 554. col. 2.
; who probably did preside in this Synod, as all Bishops use to do in their own
Cities; but he did not call this Council, for S. Hierom expressly says, The
Emperors Letters called these Bishops to Rome Hieron. Ep. 27.
. And the Synodical Letter of the Constantinopolitan Fathers tell us, That
Damasus desired Theodosius to write to them also of the East to come to Rome:
Which shows that Damasus could not summon them by his own Authority; but the
Editors and Baronius, out of a false Latin Version of Theodoret, have put in
the word [Mandato,] which word is not in the Greek, nor any thing answering to
it Theodor. lib. 5. cap. 9. Baron. An. 382. page 397. and B^n. page 539. col. 2.
; and it was foisted in on purpose, to persuade such as did not read the
Original, that the Pope had commanded the Eastern Bishops to come to Rome.
Again, though the Notes confess, the Acts of this Roman Council are lost, so
that it does not appear what was done there. Yet soon after they produce a long
Canon for the Popes Supremacy, and the Precedence of the Patriarchs; feigning
it was made in this Synod. But if the Canon be not a Vatican Forgery (which is
very much to be suspected) however it is Antedated one hundred and twelve
years, as Labbe confesses in his Margen; for he says, it was decreed under
Pope Gelasius, An. 494 Lab. p. 1014. Bin. page 554. col. 2.
. But the Policy of laying this Canon here, is to make a show as if Damasus had
then publicly declared against the Council of Constantinoples giving that
Bishop the second place; but their forging this Proof only shows, they have no
genuine Authority for it; yet if they could prove that the Pope disliked this
Precedence, since it is certain that Constantinople did take the second place
according to this Canon, that would only show that the Popes Authority was not
regarded. Which also appears in the Case of Flavianus, who (as the Notes
conjecture) was in this Roman Synod deposed, and Paulinus: made Bishop of
Antioch: Yet still the greatest part of the World owned Flavianus for the true
Bishop of that See, and the Synod of Sides, where Amphilocius Bishop of Iconium
was President, directed their Synodical Epistle to Flavianus, as Patriarch of
Antioch Lab. p. 1015. Bin. page 556. col. 2. Baron. An. 383.
; so that the Editors should not have styled that Council, Under Damasus;
because they acted against his Mind: And so did the Eastern Bishops, who met
again this year at Constantinople, when the Pope had desired them to come to
Rome, and from this Meeting they writ that Synodical Epistle which the Editors
here print over again, and wherein they call Jerusalem, The Mother of all
Churches; a Title now by Usurpation appropriated only to Rome.

. 29. Siricius succeeded Damasus, An. Dom. 385.
but not without trouble; for Ursicinus, the Competitor of Damasus, being yet
alive and at Rome, was declared Pope by a great party, and Prosper's Chronicle
makes him the next Pope after Damasus Baron. An. 384. page 327.
; nor could Siricius get the Chair, but by a Rescript from the Emperor
Valentinian, which condemned Ursicinus, and established Siricius Baron. An.
385. page 335.
. There is little or no notice of him before his Election, and though he sat
fifteen years (as the Pontifical and Platina,) or thirteen (as the Notes say)
there is very little worthy remarking done by him: And it is very probable he
was one of those ignorant Clergymen with which the Roman Church was so well
stored at that time, that S. Hierom says, Not one of them did so much as
pretend to Scholarship; but this illiterate Faction, who had proclaimed War
against all Learning, conspired also against him Hierom. in Praef. ad Didym. de
Spir. Sancto.
. For we have reason to judge this Pope to be of their Party, because S. Hierom
left Rome in disgust, as soon as Siricius came to be Pope; and Paulinus who
came in his time to Rome says, The City Pope proudly despised him Paulin. ad
Sever. Epist. 1.
; yea, Baronius owns, That Ruffinus, when he was fallen into Origin 's Heresy,
imposed on the Simplicity of this Pope, and got Communicatory Letters of him
Baron. An. 397. page 32. ex Hieron. ep. 16.
; which also seems to spoil his Infallibility, for which Ignorance is no proper
qualification. Yet wanting real Matter in this Pope's Life, the Notes run out
into the story of the death of Monica, S. Augustine's Mother, saying, That when
she died, she was only solicitous to have the Mass offered up for her Lab. p.
1016. Bin. page 557. col. 1.
, and this they prove out of Augustine's Confessions; but the Fathers words
are, She only desired to be commemorated in the Offices, when the Priest stood
at the Altar. Now there is a mighty difference between that ancient Custom of
commemorating the Faithful departed, which is allowed by the Church of England,
and the Popish way of offering Mass for the Souls of the Deceased, a corruption
of much later date than S. Augustine's time.

For this Pope are published diverse Decretal Epistles, which are the first that
can pretend to be genuine; and if they be really so, it is plain, that their
Style is mean, the Arguments trifling, and the Scripture Proofs impertinent; so
that the Author was no Conjurer. The first directed to Himerius is very severe
against Marriage, especially in the Clergy: The Notes would persuade us, It is
not lawful Marriage, which he calls Pollution (as they say Calvin falsely
affirms Lab. p. 1022. Bin. page 559. col. 2.
;) but if we read the Epistle, he calls New Marriages (that is, the Marriage of
such as had been Widows) Pollution, as well as those Marriages which were
prohibited. Again, he foolishly attempts to prove, Clergymen ought not to
Marry, because S. Paul says, Those that are in the flesh cannot please God;
and though he confess it was usual for many Clergymen to live with their
Wives, he calls that cohabitation, the being polluted with carnal
Concupiscence, in his 4th Epistle: So that he is justly taxed with speaking
profanely of God's holy Ordinance, and of contradicting S. Paul, who excepted
not the Clergy, when he said, Marriage is honorable in all me, and the Bed
undefiled, Hebr. XIII. 4. And probably it was the hot and bold discourses of
Siricius and some other Writers of this time, which provoked Jovinian, not only
to stand up for Marriage, but to decry Single Life, the merit of which had so
possessed the minds of some great Men, that they resolved to condemn Jovinian
for an Heretic. As for the second Epistle of Siricius to the Council at Milan,
relating to this Resolve, it may be questioned whether it be genuine; but that
the style is harsh and barbarous is unquestionable. The Answer to this Letter
from Milan is evidently patched up out of diverse Authors who writ upon this
Subject. However S. Ambrose and his Suffragans there, call the Pope Brother,
even when they Complement him, as a great Master and Doctor Lab. p. 1024. Bin
page 560. and 561.
, which smells strong of the Forge; and if this Epistle were made up there,
then the Notes need not triumph so much, when it says, (upon Jovinians being
condemned at Rome) That the Bishop of Rome had looked well to the Gate
committed to him; that is (say they) the Gate of the whole Church of which
Christ made S. Peter 's Successor the Door-keepers Lab. p. 102^. Bin. page 561.
col. 1. Baron. An. 390. page 536.
. But if the Epistle be true, it only commends the Pope for looking well to the
Gate of his own Church at Rome, as they had done to their Gate at Milan; having
turned him out of that Church before. The third Epistle of Siricius is like the
former for style and sense, yet the Editors will not reject it, because the
Pope says, He has the care of all the Churches Lab. p. 1027. Bin. p. 561.
col. 2.
; but let it be noted, that Aurelius Bishop of Carthage uses the same words of
himself a little after Bin. p. 577. col. 1.
, and there Binius notes, That Aurelius means, of the Churches of Africa only,
not of the whole World: So we may say justly of Siricius here, that he means,
He had the Care of the Suburbicarian Churches, not those of the whole World.
For the fourth Epistle (said to be writ from a Roman Council) calls the Pope no
more but a Primate Lab. p. 1029. Bin. page 562. col. 1.
, and that Title belonged to the Bishop of Carthage, as well as to him of Rome;
but indeed Labbe honestly confesses this fourth Epistle to be stolen out of
Innocent's Epistle to Victricius. The fifth and sixth Epistle; are writ by
Maximus, an Usurper of the Empire, and seem to be genuine; but we need not
wonder at the Tyrants speaking so kind things of the Pope in them, since it was
his interest to Flatter the Bishop of that potent City.

. 30. This Maximus having seized on the Northwest parts of the Empire, summoned
a Council at Bourdeaux (which the Editors without any ground style, under
Siricius) wherein the Bishops of the Gallican Church again condemned the
Priscillianists, and they appealed (not to the Pope, but) to the Emperor
Maximus Lab. p. 1030. B^n. page 563. col. 2.
) who was so far from favoring these Heretics, that at the instance of
Ithacius, a Catholic Bishop, he caused them to be put to death for their
Heresy: Which cruel Sentence so displeased Theognistus and other Orthodox
Bishops, that they Excommunicated Ithacius and all his Party, who had procured
these Heretics to be put to death; and S. Martin, S. Ambrose, and the best Men
of that Age, would not communicate with any of these Bishops, who had
prosecuted Men to death for Heresy; no not though Ithacius and his Adherents
were absolved from Theognistus his Excommunication in a Council which Maximus
had called at Triers. Now the Notes, fearing the Reader should observe, That
many Popes and Bishops of their Communion have done just as Ithacius did, viz.
persecuted, such as they call Heretics, to death, and delivered them up to the
Secular Magistrate to be executed, tell us, That it was not an ill thing in
Ithacius to procure the death of these Heretics, but his Fault was in the
violence of his Proceedings, and in his not interposing such a Protestation as
their Church uses on these occasions. Wherein, when they have made it necessary
for the Magistrate to put an Heretic to death, they solemnly declare, they wish
he would amend, and do not desire his Execution Lab. p. 1038. Bin. page 564.
col. 1. Baron. An. 386. page 451.
. But as this Protestation is a piece of notorious Hypocrisy unknown to those
Ages; so we may be sure so apparent a Sham would not have excused Ithacius,
whose Communion (as Sulpicius Severus shows) was renounced by S. Ambrose, S.
Martin and Others, purely because they thought it unlawful, especially for
Clergymen, to procure any persons to be put to death for their Opinion, though
it were Heresy. Wherefore these Holy Bishops, if they were now alive, must
renounce the Communion of the Roman Church for the same reason, for which they
renounced the Communion of Ithacius, even for their frequent procuring Heretics
to be put to death; and this is so plain, that all their shuffling Notes cannot
wash their Bishops hands from Blood, nor fit them in S. Ambrose and S. Martin's
Opinion, to celebrate the Eucharist with other Christians.

There had been (as we noted) a long Schism at Antioch, between Paulinus (of
whose side was the Pope, An. Dom. 398.
and many Western Bishops) and Flavianus, who was supported by the Eastern
Bishops; and now Paulinus dying, one Evagrius was irregularly chosen to succeed
him, and keep up the Schism; and though Flavianus was owned for the true Bishop
by the second General Council, and he it was who ordained S. Chrysostom, and
obtained a Pardon from Theodosius for those Citizens of Antioch, who had broke
down the Statues of that Emperor and his Empress; yet at the Instance of some
Western Bishops the Emperor was persuaded to cite him to a Council, which he
had called at Capua, in which S. Ambrose was present; but Flavianus not willing
to have his Enemies to be his Judges, did easily excuse his Nonappearance to
the Emperor, and the Synod thereupon referred the Matter between him and
Evagrius unto Theophilus, Patriarch of Alexandria, to whose decision Flavianus
refusing to stand, he appealed to Theodosius; on which occasion S. Ambrose
writing to Theophilus, wishes rather Flavianus had referred the Matter to his
Brother the Bishop of Rome, because (says he) you would probably have judged
it (if it had come before you) so as he would have liked Ambros. ^d Theophil.
ep 78.
. Which implies no more, than that Theophilus and Siricius were both of one
mind in this case of Flavianus; yet on this slight occasion the Notes say, That
the Synod made Theophilus Arbitrator on condition, he should offer his Sentence
to be approved and confirmed by the Roman Church Lab. p. 1039 Bin. page 564.
col. 1.
: Which is a mere Forgery; for Theophilus was made absolute Arbitrator by the
Synod, and this is not the Councils wish, but S. Ambroses; and after all
Flavianus did not think a Western Synod had any power over him; and therefore
he rejected the Arbitration of Theophilus, the Council, and Pope Siricius also,
with whom though he did not communicate, yet he was always owned to be true
Bishop of Antioch.

. 31. The Second Council at Arles is supposed to be held about this time,
because the Followers of Photinus and Bonosus were there condemned: Wherefore
they say, It was in the time of Siricius; but under him it could not be, since
the Bishops there assembled do not name him, nor do they except the Bishop of
Romes Supreme Power, when they refer all Ecclesiastical Matters to the final
decision of their own Metropolitan and his Synod, and declare, that every
Bishop who receives a person Excommunicated by another, shall be guilty of
Schism. Yet the Editors are so apt to dote upon the Popes managing all
Councils, that they here style a meeting of the Novatian Heretics at Angaris in
Bithynia Lab. p. 1041. Bin. page 566. col. 2.
, A Synod under Siricius; and call poor Socrates a Novatian, for barely
relating a Matter of Fact concerning the Novatians.

An. Dom. 393.
At this time there was a great Council at Hippo, which the Notes sometimes call
a General, and sometimes a Plenary Council, because most of the African Bishops
were there, and the Original dates it with the Consuls of this year; but the
Editors clap a New Title to it, saying, it was under Siricius; who in all
probability had no hand in it, nor knew any thing of it: Yet here were made
many of those famous Canons for Discipline, by which the African Church was
governed. But they are more wary in the next Council of Constantinople, at
which many Bishops were present, and among them the two Patriarchs of
Alexandria and Antioch; being summoned (in the absence of the Emperor) by his
Prefect Ruffinus; and they will not venture to say, This was under Siricius,
for the Matters treated on it wholly related to the Eastern Church, and in that
Age they rarely allowed the Pope to concern himself in their Affairs: No nor in
Afric neither, where ( Anno 395) there were Councils held both by the Orthodox
and the Donatists, which are dated by the Consuls, and no notice is taken of
the Pope Lab. p. 1153. Bin. page 567. col. 2.
. We shall only observe, that upon one of these Councils the Notes say, It is a
mark of the Donatists, being of the Synagogue of Antichrist, that they named
the several Parties among them from the Leaders and Founders of their several
Sects, and were not content with the Name of Christians from Christ. Which Note
reflects upon the Monks of their own Church, who are called Benedictines,
Dominicans, and Franciscans, from the Founders of their several Orders.

In the Council of Turin, An. Dom. 397.
composed of the Gallican Bishops, they decided the Case of Primacy between the
Bishop of Arles and Vienna, without advising with the Pope, and determined they
would not communicate with Foelix, a Bishop of Ithacius his Party, according to
the Letters of Ambrose, of Blessed Memory, Bishop of Milan, and of the Bishop
of Rome. Now, here the Roman Advocates are much disturbed to find S. Ambrose
his Name before Siricius; and when they repeat this Passage in the Notes, they
falsely set the Pope's Name first, contrary to the express words of the fifth
Canon, and impudently pretend, That the Bishop of Rome, by his place, was the
ordinary Judge who should be communicated with, and Ambrose was only made so by
the Popes Delegation Lab. p. 1157, and 1158. Bin. page 568. and 569.
. But, how absurd is it (if this were so) for the Council to place the Name of
the Delegate, before his who gave him power? And every one may see, that this
Council was directed to mark this Decree principally by S. Ambrose his Advice,
and secondarily by the Popes; for at that time Ambrose his Fame and Interest
was greater than that of Siricius; yet after all, the Council decreed this, not
by the Authority of either of these Bishops (as the Notes pretend,) but only by
their Information, and upon their Advice by these Letters, which were not first
read (as they pretend) but after four other businesses were dispatched.

An. Dom. 397, etc.
The Canons of diverse African Councils, held at Carthage and elsewhere, have
been put together long since, and collected into one Code, which makes the time
and order of the Councils wherein they were made, somewhat difficult; but since
the Canons were always held Authentic, we need not (with the Editors) be much
concerned for their exact order, or for reducing them to the years of the Pope,
because they were neither called nor ratified by his Authority. Yea, the Notes
say, It was never heard that any, but the Bishop of Carthage called a Council
there, his Letters gave Summons to it, he presided over it, and first gave his
Suffrage in it, -- and that even when Faustinus ( an Italian Bishop) the Popes
Legate was present Lab. p. 1163. Bin. page 573. col. 1* and 2.
. As for the particular Canons of the third Council, the Nineteenth says, That
the Readers shall either profess Continence; or they shall be compelled to
Marry; but they feign old Copies which say, They shall not be allowed to Read,
if they will not contain Lab. p. 1170. Bin. page 575. col. 1.
; the falsehood of which appears by the 25th Canon in the Greek and Latin
Edition, where this is said of the Clergy, (...); that is, Except the Readers,
which they translate, Quamvis Lectorum Bin p. 580.
, on purpose to make us think, that the command of Celibacy (upon which that
Age too much doted) reached the lowest order of the Clergy, even Readers;
contrary to the express words of the Canons. And to the second Council of
Carthage, where only Bishops, Priests and Deacons are under an obligation to
live single Bin. p. 571.
. Secondly, The 26th Canon of the third Council forbids the Bishop of the first
See, to be called by the Title of Prince, or Chief of Bishops, (Gratian goes
on) neither may the Roman Bishop be called Universal Lab. p. 1170. Bin. page
575. col. 2. and Gratian. Decret. part 1. did. 99.
. The Notes tax Gratian indeed for adding this Sentence; but if he did, it was
out of Pope Gregory, who says, That no Patriarch ought to be called Universal.
Besides, considering how apt the Editors are to strike out words not Agreeable
to the Interest of Rome, it is more probable that some of the Popes Friends
lately left these words out, than that Gratian put them in: And since this
Council forbid Appeals to foreign Judicatures with peculiar respect to Rome, to
which some of the Criminal Clergy then began to appeal Lab. p. 1171. Bin. page
581. col. 2.
, it is not unlikely these Fathers might resolve to check as well the Title, as
the Jurisdiction (then beginning to be set up) which encouraged these Appeals.
Thirdly, The 47th Canon in the Latin, and the 24th in the Greek and Latin
Edition, speaking of such Books, as are so far Canonical that they may be read
in Churches, reckon up some of those Books which we call Apocryphal, upon which
the Notes triumph Lab. p. 1177. Bin. page 580. col. 1.
; but let it be observed, that we grant some of these Books to be so far
Canonical, that they may be read for instruction of Manners; and also we may
note, that the best Editions of these African Canons leave out all the Books of
Macchabees and Baruch (which are foisted into their later Latin Copies Cosen's
History of the Canon p. 112. and page 113.
). And it is plain, the whole Canon is falsely placed in this Council under
Siricius, because Pope Boniface (who came not into the Papacy till above twenty
years after) is named in it as Bishop of Rome; yet after all these devices, it
does not declare what Books are strictly Canonical, and so will not justify
the Decree at Trent. Fourthly, In the 48th Canon of the Latin Version, the
Council agrees to advise about the Donatists, with Siricius Bishop of Rome, and
Simplicianus Bishop of Milan, not giving any more deference to one of these
Bishops than to the other, but looking on them as equally fit to advise them:
Yet the Notes boldly say, They advise with the Pope, because they knew he
presided, as a Bishop and Doctor, over the Catholic Church; but with the Bishop
of Milan only, as a Man every where famous for his Learning Lab. p. 1183. Bin.
page 584. col 2.
. Which is a mere Fiction of their own, for the words of the Canon show, that
these Fathers did not believe either of them had any Authority over them, only
they desired their advice jointly, as being both Eminent and Neighboring
Bishops, and their prohibiting Appeals shows, they knew nothing of the Popes
presiding over the Catholic Church.

An. Dom. 398.
. 32. Anastasius was the last Pope in this Century, of whom there would have
been as little notice taken, as of Many of his Predecessors, if it had not been
his good fortune to be known, both to S. Hierom and S. Augustine, and to assist
the latter in suppressing the Donatists, and the former in condemning the
Errors of Origin, for which cause these two Fathers make an honorable mention
of him. Yet in the African Councils, where he is named with respect, they join
Venerius Bishop of Milan with him, and call them Their Brethren and
Fellow-Bishops Baron. An. 401. p. 128, and 129.
. As for the qualifications of Anastasius, S. Hierom gives him great Encomiums;
but it must be observed, that at this time Hierom had charged Ruffinus with
broaching the Heresies of Origin at Rome, and he being then at Bethlem, could
not beat down these Opinions without the Popes help. And indeed, when Ruffinus
came first to Rome he was received kindly by the last Pope Siricius, and
Anastasius did not perceive any Errors in Ruffinus or Origin, till S. Hierom
(upon Pammachius Information) had opened his Eyes; and at last, it was three
years before this Pope could be made so sensible of this Heresy, as to condemn
it: So that notwithstanding his Infallibility, if S. Hierom and his Friends had
not discovered these Errors, they might in a little time have been declared
for Orthodox Truths at Rome; but Anastasius condemning them at last, did
wonderfully oblige S. Hierom, and this was the occasion of many of his
Commendations. For this Pope are published three Decretal Epistles, though
Baronius mentions but two, and condemns the first for a Forgery, and so does
Labbe Lab. p. 1191. Bin. page 585. col. 2. Baron. An. 402. page 161.
; It is directed to the Bishops of Germany and Burgundy, and yet Burgundy did
not receive the Christian Faith till the Year 413; it is also dated with the
Consuls of the Year 385, that is, Fourteen years before Anastasius was Pope.
The matter of it is grounded on the Pontifical, which speaks of a Decree made
by this Pope for the Priests at Rome to stand up at the Gospel; which the
Forger of this Epistle turns into a general Law, and makes it be prescribed to
the Germans. The Words of it are stolen out of the Epistles of Pope Gregory
and Leo Gregor. lib. 12 Ep. 32. Leon. Ep. 2. ad Episc. Ital.
; yet out of this Forgery they cite that Passage for the Supremacy, where the
German Bishops are advised to send to him as the Head. The second Epistle Lab.
p. 1193. Bin. page 586. col. 2.
is also spurious, being dated fifteen or sixteen years after Anastasius his
death, and stolen out of Leo's 59th Epistle. As for the third Epistle, it is
certain he did write to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, but it may be doubted
whether this be the Epistle or no Lab. p. 1194. Bin. page 586. col. 2.
; if it be genuine, it argues the Pope was no good Orator, because it is writ
in mean Latin; yet that was the only Language he understood, for he declares in
this Epistle, That he knew not who Origin was, nor what Opinions he held, till
his Works were translated into Latin. So that any Heretic who had writ in Greek
in this Pope's time, had been safe enough from the Censure of this Infallible
Judge.

The Notes dispute about the fourth Council of Carthage, whether it were under
Pope Zosimus or Anastasius Lab. p. 1208. Bin page 591. col. 1.
; but it was under neither, the true Title of it showing it was dated by the
Consuls Names, and Called by Aurelius Bishop of Carthage, who made many
excellent Canons here without any assistance from the Pope. The 51st, 52d and
53d Canons of this Council order Monks to get their Living, not by Begging, but
by honest Labor; and the Notes show, This was the Primitive use Lab. p. 1210.
Bin. page 592. col. 1.
; which condemns those vast numbers of Idle Monks and Mendicant Friars, now
allowed in the Church of Rome. The hundredth Canon absolutely forbids a Woman
to presume to Baptize; but the Notes Lab. p. 1211. Bin. ut supr.
, (because this practice is permitted in their Church) add to this Canon these
words, unless in case of necessity, and except when no Priest is present. Which
shows how little reverence they have for ancient Canons, since they add to
them, or diminish them, as they please to make them agree with their modern
Corruptions.

In the fifth Council of Carthage, Can. 3. Bishops and Priests are forbid to
accompany with their Wives (...), that is, at the time of their being to
Officiate; but in their Latin Copies it is altered thus, -- according to their
own, (or, to their former) Statutes; which makes it a general and total
Prohibition: But the Greek words of this Canon are cited, and expounded at the
great Council in Trullo, where many African Bishops were present, as importing
only a Prohibition of accompanying their Wives, when their turns came to
Minister Lab. p. 1219. Bin. page 594. col. 2. Beveridg. Council. Tom. II. page
130.
; which is the true sense of this Canon, though the Romanists, for their
Churches Credit would impose another. The fourteenth Canon of this Council
takes notice of the feigned Relics of Martyrs, and of Altars built in Fields
and Highways, upon pretended Dreams and Revolutions; upon which Canon there is
no note at all Lab. p. 1217. Bin. page 594. col. 1.
, because they know, if all the feigned Relics were to be thrown away, and all
the Altars built upon Dreams and false Revelations pulled down in the present
Roman Church, (as was ordered at Carthage by this Canon) there would be very
few left to carry on their gainful Trade, which has thrived wonderfully by
these Impostures.

This Century concludes with a Council at Alexandria, which they style under
Anastasius Bin. p. 595.
; but it was called by Theophilus, who found out and condemned the Errors of
Origin long before poor Anastasius knew any thing of the matter. The Notes
indeed say, This Synod sent their Decrees to Pope Anastasius, to Epiphanius,
Chrysostom and Hierom: But though they place (...) Pope foremost, there is no
proof that they were sent to him at all. Baronius only conjectures they did,
and says, It is fit we should believe this Baron. An. 399 p. 85, and 88.
; but it is certain Theophilus sent these Decrees to Epiphanius to Chrysostom
and Hierom; and from this last hand it is like Anastasius received them long
after, because it was more than two years after this Synod, before S. Hierom
could persuade Anastasius to condemn these Opinions of Origin, which this
Council first censured: Wherefore it was happy for the Church, that there were
wiser Men in it than he who is pretended to be the supreme and sole Judge of
Heresy. And thus we have finished our Remarks upon the Councils in the first
four Centuries, in all which the Reader (I hope) has seen such designs to
advance the Supremacy, and cover the Corruptions of Rome, that he will scarce
credit any thing they say for their own Advantage in any of the succeeding
Volumes.

AN APPENDIX CONCERNING BARONIUS HIS ANNALS.
. 1. THE large and elaborate Volumes of Cardinal Baronius, are the main Guide
to the Editors and Annotator: From him they take the Dates of all Councils, and
out of him they have added diverse new Synods not extant in the older Editions
of the Councils, of which they can say no more, than to abbreviate Baronius:
From him they borrow most of their plausible Notes, by which they either paint
over that which seems for the Interest of Rome, or disparage what makes against
it; and therefore we have had often occasion to discover his Fallacies in all
that part of his Annals which concerns the Councils; but there are many other
notorious Frauds and manifest Falsehoods in that Author, of which I shall here
give some few Instances, which may serve as a Caution to all that read his
History, and also as a Direction by which they may in other Centuries find out
his manifold Errors; and I shall confine the Examples here produced to the
Fourth Century, because that is the most largely treated of in this Discourse.

It is evident, that all the Writers of the Roman side, for many Ages have
designed to impose upon the World; in that, their Disputants, their Publishers
of Councils, and Historians do all agree; for their Principles and Practices
cannot be maintained by plain Truth. The Methods used by Baronius, in his
Ecclesiastical Annals (which he writ purely to serve the Interest of the Roman
Church) may be reduced to these Heads:

First, His frequent quoting Forged and Spurious Tracts; such as the
Pontifical, the Acts of the Martyrs, the Ecclesiastical Tables (that is, the
Roman Missal and Martyrology) with other late and fabulous Writers, such as
Nicephorus, Simeon, Metaphrastes, Laurentius Surius, etc. And the Reader shall
find, he very seldom cites any other Authors to prove the Great Actions of
Primitive Popes, or the dignity of the Roman Church, and its pretended
Privileges: As also to make out the Miracles done by many of their Saints, and
to be evidence for the Invocation of Saints, Praying for the Dead, Worshipping
the Cross, Relics and Images; for the Merits of Celibacy and Holiness of
Monks, or other Superstitions. Some Examples of which in the Fourth Century are
these: He cites the Acts of Procopius, which he confesses need amending, to
prove the Adoration of the Cross Baron. An. 308. p. 30.. 19.
; he proves the same by the Acts of Gregory an Armenian Bishop, which he owns
do not satisfy many; and by Euthymius, a late Grecian Monk, An. 1180 Id. An.
311. p. 57.. 23.
Thus he asserts Crispus his being Baptized with his Father Constantine, only
by Nicephorus, and makes out Constantine's use of putting an Image of Christ on
his Coyns, only by the Acts of Damasus, and by a Coin which he himself
confesses had been adulterated Id. An. 324. page 233.. 13, and 16.
. Constantine's Baptism in Rome is also proved by Anastasius Bibliothecarius,
who there has the false Character of an Acurate Writer Ibid. p. 237.. 30.
, and by the Acts of Sylvester, which he himself disapproves of in many things
Ibid.. 31.
; and suspects, that notwithstanding all these fabulous Authors, his Reader
will not credit the Story Ibid. p. 238.. 32.
. The Legend of S. Agnes and her Temple at Rome, he confesses, Was made by an
Unknown-hand under the Name of S. Ambrose; yet he gives a long relation of it
Ib. page 260.. 107.
. So when Eusebius, who writ acurately about the Temple built over the
Sepulcher by Constantine, says nothing of Pictures in it, he proves there was
such there by the second Nicene Council Baron An. 326. page 353.. 42.
. Eusebius's Greek Chronicle says nothing of the Invention of the Cross, but
some Forger has put it into the Latin Version of it; therefore Baronius cites
the corrupted Latin Translation to prove this Legend Id. ibid.
. The Miracles of S. Nicholas are all transcribed out of his Acts, which were
put together by Authors who lived above Five hundred years after his time, and
the genuine ancient Historians mention not one of them An. 326. p. 366.. 86.
. Eusebius says, Constantine dedicated his new City of Constantinople to God;
but Baronius chooses to follow a later Writer of little credit, viz.
Nicephorus; who says (in the Phrase of his own time) He dedicated it to the
Virgin Mary Ibid. An. 330. p. 396.. 4.
. He makes a discourse about the use of the Pall in the Life of Pope Mark; yet
he can cite no Author, but the fabulous Pontifical, to prove it was used in his
time An. 336. p. 458. 63.
. To prove the Arian Pope Foelix was a Martyr, he cites an Inscription
pretended to be found in a Grave at Rome (where such Frauds are common) about
Twelve hundred years after his Death An. 357. page 715.. 50.
; so he makes out the Martyrdom of diverse under Julian by an Oration of
Nectarius (which he confesses is corrupted) and by Nicephorus Annal. Tom. IV.
An. 362. p. 21. and 22.
: And a little after he tells long Stories of Martyrs at that time condemned by
Julian at Rome, which he proves by the Ecclesiastical Tables, and by the Acts
of the Martyrs; yet he owns Julian was not at Rome at this time Eod. An. page
84.
. Prayers at the Graves of the Saints he would establish by a forged Book of
the Lives of the Prophets, which he cites under Epiphanius's name An. 373. page
309.
: So he would make out Prayers for the Dead, used in this Age, by feigned
Writings, which are ascribed to Ephraem Syrus An. 378. p. 332.
. The Miracles ascribed to Damasus cannot be proved by one Author of Credit,
but are set off with the forged Acts of Damasus, and the modern Legends An.
384. p. 427.
. So also the Miracles ascribed to S. Chrysostom, are not taken generally from
any approved Authors, but from his spurious Acts An. 386. page 468.
; and (to name no more) thus he proves the Adoration of the Cross by an Homily
falsely ascribed to S. Chrysostom An. 397. Tom. V. p. 44.
: For his genuine Works do witness against this practice. And now that he did
not cite these Authorities out of ignorance, is plain from his Confession; for
he says of the Acts of the Martyrs, That we might better have wanted many
Truths concerning them, than have had such a mixture of Errors as makes the
whole suspected Baron. An. 307.. 33. p. 24. Tom III.
. And again, speaking of the Acts of Gallicanus, It is the manner of some to be
ashamed, to give a short Narrative of a great Affair, and so according to their
own Fancy they largely paraphrase on it Id. An. 330.. 51. p. 410.
: And yet again in his Preface to the Roman Martyrology he tells us, There was
a sad loss of these Martyrs Acts in Diocletian 's time, so that very few of
them are to be found, which may not in part be convicted of Mistakes Bar.
Praecap. ad Martyr. c. 3.
. But Melch. Canus is more ingenuous, and says, Diogenes Laertius writ the
Lives of the Philosophers more honestly, than the Christians have writ those of
the Saints Melch. Can. Can. loc. Theol. l. 11. p. 333.
: Yet you rarely have any better Evidence than these, for most of the Roman
Doctrines and Rites. And though Nicephorus and the Modern Greeks be frequently
taxed by him, for giving easy faith to feigned Stories, and for gross Mistakes
An. 306.. 12. page 3. and Tom. IV. An. 363. p. 105.
; yet when they tell never such improbable Tales for the Roman Interest, then
they are cited with great applause. Now it is a clear evidence of an ill Cause,
when they can find no other Proofs but such spurious Writings as these; of
which practice I have here given but a few Instances; but the diligent Reader
will observe this to be customary with Baronius, not only in this fourth
Century, but in every part of his Annals.

. 2. Another Artifice is to corrupt the Words or the Sense of genuine Authors,
of which we will select also a few Instances, in the same Century. S. Augustine
barely names Peter as one whom the Pagans did Calumniate Aug. de Civ. Dei, lib.
18. c. 53.
; but Baronius brings this in with this Preface, That they did this, because
they saw Peter extremely magnified, especially at Rome where he had fixed his
Seat; and then he says, S. Augustine records this, etc. whereas this is his
own Invention, to set off the glory of Rome Baron. An. 313.. 17.
. So when Athanasius is proving, that the Fathers before the Nicene Council
used the word (...), and first names Dionysius Bishop of Alexandria, and then
Dionysius Bishop of Rome Athanas. de decret. in Arian.
. Baronius says, He proves it especially by Dionysius the holy Roman Pope, and
by Dionysius Bishop of Alexandria Baron. An. 325.. 69.
, inverting the Order, and putting a Note of Eminence on the Pope, contrary to
the Words and Sense of Athanasius. Again, he cites Pope Leo (who is no Evidence
in his own Cause); and yet Baronius would make him say more than he does, even
where he says more than he should say: For he cites his 53d Epistle to show,
that Leo affirmed the sixth Canon of Nice, allowed to the Church of Alexandria
the second, and to that of Antioch the third Seat, which had before been
conferred on them by Rome. But the very words of Leo, cited by Baronius, show
this to be false; for Leo says not, that these Sees had their Dignity or Order
from Rome, but the former from S. Mark, the later from Peter's first Preaching
there Leon. ep. 53. ap. Baron. An. 325.. 28.
. Moreover, to make his Reader fancy the Roman and the Catholic Church was all
one of old, he mentions out of Epiphanius, Constantine's writing an Epistle to
all Romania, Which Name (says he) we sometimes find used for the Catholic
Church Baron. An. 319.. 6.
; whereas it is manifest, that Epiphanius both there and elsewhere plainly uses
Romania for the Roman Empire Epiphan. contra Manich. haer. 66. and contr.
Arian. haer. 69.
; and Baronius did not find it used either in him, or in any other ancient
Author, in any other sense. That Period in Optatus, which Baronius cites with
great applause (if it be not added by some ignorant Zealot of the Roman side)
is a scandal to the Learning of that Father, for he derives the Syriac word,
Cephas, from the Greek (...), and by that ridiculous Etymology would draw as
contemptible a consequence, viz. That Peter was Head of the Apostles; and again
he seems wilfully to pervert the Precept of S. Paul, Romans XII. 13. Distributing
to the necessities of the Saints; which in Optatus's Reading is, Communicating
with the Memories of the Saints; that is, (as he applies it) with Rome, where
there are the Memorials of two of the Apostles. I could wish for Optatus's
Credit that these weak Passages were spurious, or buried in silence; and the
Learned Baldwin is ashamed of this gross Error Opt. Milev. lib. 2. page 48.
Baldvin. notis, page 184.
: But Baronius thinks, though they make for the dishonor of the Father, they
tend to the Credit of Rome, and so he cites them in great pomp, and puts them
in a whole Line to make them look more plausible, -- the Head of the Apostles,
whence he was called Cephas (so Optatus: But Binius adds) deducing the
Interpretation from the Greek Word, for in Syriac it signifies an hard Stone
Baron. An. 321.. 5.
; and then glories extremely, as if Optatus had made Communion with Rome the
sole Note of a Catholic. Whereas in the next Page but one, Optatus goes on, --
You cannot prove you have any Communion with the Seven Churches of Asia, -- and
yet if you be out of the Communion of those Churches, you are to be accounted
Aliens. Which Passage Baronius very fraudulently leaves out Opt. Milev. lib. 2.
page 50.
, because it shows a true Catholic must not only be in Communion with Rome, but
also with all other Orthodox Churches,

To proceed, Even in spurious Authors he uses this Artifice; for that Forged
Book of Constantine's Munificence only says, He placed a piece of the Cross,
in a Church which he had built: But Baronius relates it That he placed it there
with most Religious Worship Baron. An. 324.. 105.
; and a little after he perceiving that Fabulous Author had supposed
Constantine buried his Mother long before she died, puts in of his own head,
But this (i. e. the putting his Mother in a Porphyry Coffin) was done afterward
Id. ib.. 114.
. Speaking of the Bishops returning home from the Council of Nice, he says,
They took with them the Rule of Faith, confirmed by the Pope of Rome, to be
communicated to their People, and to absent Bishops: But no Historian, Ancient
or Authentic, mentions any preceding Confirmation of the Nicene Creed by the
Pope, who was one of the absent Bishops, to whom it was to be communicated;
wherefore those words, Of its being confirmed by the Pope, are invented and
added to the story by Baronius Baron. An. 325.. 197.
. He observes, That Constantine confesses, he was not fit to judge in the Case
of Athanasius, because Ecclesiastical Matters were to be judged among the
Clergy: Which he proves by Constantine's Letter there recited; but
Constantine's Letter is not directed to the Clergy, but To the People of the
Catholic Church at Alexandria: And his Words are to the People who lived on the
Place, and knew the Matters of Fact; and therefore he says to them, It is
proper for you, and not for me to judge of that Affair Baron. An 329.. 7, 8.
; so that Baronius forces his own Sense upon the Emperor. And when Theodoret
speaks of -- time for Repentance according to the Canons of the Church, he
adds, -- that is, for Satisfaction. Which Popish Satisfaction he would also
prove out of a Canon at Antioch, which only mentions confessing the Fault, and
bringing forth fruits meet for Repentance An. 341.. 43, and 44.
. When Socrates only says, Eusebius of Nicomedia 's Letters were received by
Julius after his death; Baronius thus enlarges it, Eusebius, who had fled from
the Judgment of the Roman Church was forced against his Will, being dead (as
Socrates says) to come to the strict Tribunal of God Vid. Socrat. lib. 2. cap.
13. Baron. An. 342.. 43.
. Where Athanasius says, I went up to Rome, that I might visit the Church and
the Bishop: Baronius ridiculously infers, that when we find the Ancients
speaking of THE Church and THE Bishop, they mean the Roman Church and that
Bishop, of whom, and in whom, and by whom are all other Bishops An. 349.. 6.
. Which Note is forced upon this place, for here Rome is named in the same
Sentence with the Church and the Bishop, and so it must be understood of the
Pope; but without any advantage to him more than it would have been to the
Bishop of Eugubium, to say, I went to Eugubium and visited the Church and the
Bishop. Again, S. Hierom says expressly, that Acacius substituted Foelix an
Arian to be Bishop of Rome in Liberius his stead. Here Baronius pretends some
Copies leave out the word Arian, and so he reads it, Substituted Foelix to be
Bishop of Rome An. 355.. 51.
; and because some such Parasites of Rome as himself, who would not endure that
ungrateful Truth of a Pope's being an Heretic, had left out this word, He
boldly asserts it for the true Reading; whereas not only Socrates expressly
says, He was an Arian in Opinion; but Hierom himself in his Chronicle affirms,
that Foelix was put in by the Arians; and it is not like they would have put
him in, if he had not been of their party. The Greek of Sozomen is no more but
(...). but Baronius improves this by a flattering Paraphrase in these words,
Lest the Seat of Peter should be bespattered with any spot of Infamy An. 357..
43.
. But it is a bolder falsification of S. Chrysostom, where he says (in one of
his Sermons, on a day celebrated in memory of two Martyrs, Juventius and
Maximus) -- (...); to pervert this by his Latin Version thus, The Martyrs which
we this day worship; whereas Chrysostom only says, The Martyrs which occasion
us to meet this day Chrysostom. Tom. V. p. 534. Baron. An. 362. page 48.
. Epiphanius expressly condemns those as Heretics who worship the Blessed
Virgin, and says, No man may adore Mary. Baronius will not cite this place at
large, but adds to it these Words, -- she is not to be worshipped as a God:
Which Falsification of the Father is designed to excuse their Churches
Idolatrous worship of the Virgin Mary Epiphan. haeres. 79. Baron. An. 373. p.
309.
. The restitution of Peter Bishop of Alexandria is by S. Hierom (whom he cites
with applause) ascribed to the late Repentance of the Emperor Valens: who
recalled (now at last) the Orthodox from Banishment; and Socrates only mentions
Damasus's Letters, which Peter took with him, approving both his Creation and
the Nicene Faith: Yet he from hence notes the Supreme Power of the Pope, by
whose order the Bishop of Alexandria was restored to his Church, in contempt of
Valens his Authority; and when he returned with the Popes Authority, the People
placed him in his Seat Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 30. and Baron. An. 377. page 325.
. Yea, after this he pretends to cite Socrates, as if he said, Peter was
received, being restored by Damasus Id. An. 378. page 335.
; yet Damasus did no more in all this matter, than barely to testify that
Peter was an Orthodox Bishop, and that he believed him duly elected; which is
all that Socrates says, and which if any eminent Orthodox Bishops had
testified, it would equally have served the Bishop of Alexandria's Cause. To
conclude, Baronius owns Paulinus, to have been a credulous Man, and very
unskilful in Ecclesiastical History Baron. Tom. V. An. 395. p. 15.
; yet thinking he had not spoken enough, when he relates, That a Church was
adorned with Pictures; he stretches this into, Adorned with Sacred Images Id.
An. 394. page 612.
. From all which Instances we may infer, That the Cardinal would not stick at
misquoting and misrepresenting his Authors, when it might serve the Roman
Interest.

. 3. Of this kind also we may reckon his crafty suppressing such Authorities,
in whole or in part, as seem to cross the Opinions and Practices of their
Church. His leaving out a passage in Optatus, wherein that Father makes the
being in Communion with the Seven Churches of Asia a Note of a true Catholic,
was noted before Vid. supra. 2. and Baron. An. 321.. 5.
. And we may give many such like Instances: Sozomen relates an Imperial Law,
wherein those are declared Heretics, who do not hold the Faith, which Damasus
Bishop of Rome and Peter of Alexandria then held Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 4. p. 415.
; but the fraudulent Annalist leaves out Peter of Alexandria, and mentions only
Damasus as the sole standard of Catholic Faith Baron. An. 378. page 339.
. When S. Hierom says, His Adversaries condemned him with Damasus and Peter:
Baronius bids us observe, with what reverence the Pope's Enemies treated him;
for though they accused S. Hierom of Heresy, yet against Damasus they durst
not open their Mouth Baron. An. 378. page 347.
; whereas S. Hierom protected himself by the Authority of the Bishop of
Alexandria, as well as by that of the Pope. Again, after a crafty Device to
hide the evident Testimony which Gregory Nyssen gives, against going in
Pilgrimage to Jerusalem, He slightly mentions an Epistle of S. Hierom, which
excellently confutes that then growing Superstition; telling us, That the Court
of Heaven is as open from Britain as from Jerusalem. Which remarkable Sentence,
and all the other learned Arguments of that Epistle he omits by design Hieron.
Ep. 13. Tom. l. p. 120. Baron. An. 386. p. 454, 455.
; though if it had countenanced this Superstition, we should have had it cited
at large. In like manner afterward, when he had another fair occasion to cite
this same Epistle, which does so effectually condemn Pilgrimages, he will not
quote one word out of it, but barely mentions it, and runs out into the
Enquiry, what time it was writ Baron. An. 394. p. 613.
. I have given many more Instances of these fraudulent Concealments in my
Discourse of Councils, and therefore shall add no more here, but only this,
That whoever reads Baronius's Annals, hears no more generally than the Evidence
of one side, and that too, enlarged, if it be never so slight, and commended,
if it be never so spurious; but whatever makes against the Roman Church is
depreciated and perverted, or else clapped under Hatches, and kept out of sight:
Of which we have an Instance in Eusebius, who because he will not justify
their Forgeries about Constantine's Baptism and Donation, (though he be the
best of all the Ecclesiastical Historians) is never cited, but with Reproaches
and Calumnies Annal. 324.. 143, 144, and 152. An. 325.. 192, and 193. Et An.
336.. 7, 8. Item An. 340.. 40, etc.
; and whatever he says against them, is either concealed, or the force of it
taken off, by reviling him as an Arian.

. 4. Another, Artifice of our Annalist is, first to suppose things which make
for the honor of his Church, without any manner of proof, and then to take his
own Suppositions for grounds of Argument. Thus he supposes, that Constantine
gave S. Peter thanks for his Victory, without any evidence from History Baron.
An. 312.. 58.
; yea, against his own peculiar Notion, That Constantine was then a Pagan, and
durst not do any act to make him seem a Christian Id. ibid.. 62.
. Again, To color their Worship of Images, He barely supposes, that the Pagan
Senate dedicated a Golden Image of Christ to Constantine Baron. An. 312.. 68,
69.
: He argues only from Conjectures, to prove the Munificence of that Emperor to
Rome Baron. An. 324.. 72.
; whereas, if so eminent a Prince had given such great Gifts to the most famous
City in the World, doubtless some Author would have mentioned it, and not have
left the Cardinal to prove this by random Guesses. Again, He supposes without
any proof, that Constantine knew the Supreme Power over all Christians, was in
the Church of Rome Eod. An.. 117.
, He produces nothing but mere Conjectures, that Osius was the Pope's Legate;
yet he boldly draws rare Inferences from this Eod. An.. 127.
. He does but guess and take it for granted, that the Nicene Council was called
by the Advice of Pope Sylvester Eod. An.. ult.
; yet this is a Foundation for the Supremacy, and I know not what. Thus, when
he has no Author to prove, that Athanasius venerated the Martyrs, he makes it
out with Who can doubt it? -- and it is fit to believe he did so Baron. An.
342.. 42.
. So he tells us, He had said before, that Damasus favored Gregory Nazianzen
in his being elected to be Bishop of Constantinople Baron. An. 380, page 362.
. He supposes this indeed a little before Ibid. p. 359.
: But all Ancient Authors say, and he himself affirms, That Peter ( Bishop of
Alexandria) did institute him into that Bishopric Idem p. 355.
. He only supposes Siricius desired Theodosius to banish the Manichees from
Rome; but the Rescript is not directed to him, but to Albinus the Prefect; and
(except the fabulous Pontifical) there is no Evidence that Siricius was
concerned in this matter Baron. An. 389. p. 513.
. Theodoret says, The Emperor chose Telemachus into the number of Martyrs;
but Baronius supposes, This was done not only by the Emperor's Care, but by
the Ecclesiastical Authority of the Pope Baron. An. 395.. 621.
. To conclude, He affirms by guess, That S. Nicetus came out of Dacia into
Italy, to Visit the Apostles Tombs, and to consult the Apostolical Seat Baron.
An. 397. page 28, and 29.
; but no Author makes this out. Now, how can any Reader trust an Historian, who
in relating things done many Ages ago, takes the liberty to invent and suppose
whatever will serve a present Turn?

. 5. Add to this that he scruples not to contradict himself, and to tell
manifest Untruths to carry on the Interest of Rome, which we shall prove by
these Examples: He affirms Coelicianus (Bishop of Carthage) relied upon one
defense, The Communion of the Apostolic See; but immediately he tells us, That
he was supported by Constantine 's favor Baron. An. 313.. 18, 19.
. He cites S. Augustine, saying, Constantine (when Coecilian's Cause was
referred to him) was a Christian Emperor; yea, he cites a Letter of
Constantine, writ in a most Christian style; and yet he feigns, that
Coelicianus delayed his appearing before this Emperor, because he thought it
unfit that a Bishop should be judged by a Layman, not yet Baptized Baron. An.
316.. 59, and 62. Collat. cum. 60.
. And again, Eight years after this he represents Constantine as a mere Pagan,
who had never heard of Peter or Paul, and took them for some Heathen Deities
Baron. An. 324.. 39.
; whereas he says, He was a Catechumen, and out of the Gospel had imbibed the
Christian Meekness eight years before Id. An. 316.. 65.
. He also affirms, That in the Year 324 there was as yet none of the Senators
believed the Christian Faith Baron. An. 324.. 76.
. And yet he says, Two year before this, that one or both the Consuls were
Christians Id. An. 322.. 1.
; yea, in the year 312. He reckons up many Senators, who had given up their
Names to Christ Id. An. 312.. 75, and 76.
. Thus he contradicts himself by following those Lying Acts of Sylvester, in
order to support the false Story of Constantine's being Baptized at Rome. Soon
after, out of a Fabulous Author he talks very big of the low Reverence which
Constantine paid to the Bishops at the Nicene Council Baron. An. 325.. 16.
; whereas all the Authentic Historians say, The Bishops rose up when he entered
in, and paid him a great respect Idem ibid.. 52.
. And when he has told many incredible Legends about the Nails of the Cross,
and seems to grant that diverse false Nails have been adored for the true, he
excuses his abused Catholics for their mistaken Worship of false Relics,
saying, That their Faith excuses their Fault Baron. An. 326.. 51, -- and 54.
; so that Lies may be innocently told and believed (it seems) at Rome. Again he
affirms, there were Monks at Rome in the year 328, and proves this by what S.
Augustine saw there at least fifty years after Baron. An. 328. 20. and 21.
; yea, in the year 340 he says, Athanasius first brought the Institution of
Monks to Rome Id. An. 340.. 8.
, which is a manifest contradiction.

To proceed, I wonder with what Face he could commend Athanasius for speaking
charitably of the Heretic Arius, after he was dead, when he reviles Eusebius
after his death Baron. An. 336.. 44. Collat. cum. An. 340.. 38.
; And never mentions any of the Protestant Doctors deceased, but with the
bitterest Malice, and in the most spightful Language he can invent: If Charity
were a Virtue in Athanasius, then Malice must be a Vice in him. He largely
relates many Appeals to the Emperor in the case of Athanasius, and yet when at
last the Bishop of Rome was chosen Arbitrator in this Case, and this but once,
He cries out, Behold, Reader, the ancient Custom! etc. Whereas since the
Emperors were Christians, it was the Custom to appeal first to him, as his
History abundantly proves Baron. An. 340.. 2.
. He very largely commends the Acts of Martyrs, but by following them falls
into many Absurdities; as where he tells us, That the Pagan Temple of Daphne at
Antioch was burnt two days after the Martyrdom of Artemius Baron. An. 362. page
37.
: Yet a little after he brings in this Artemius arguing with Julian, about the
burning of this Temple Ibid. p. 44.
. So he tells us, The Body of S. John Baptist was burnt to Ashes, except some
Bones which were carried into Egypt to Athanasius: And yet a little after S.
Hierom affirms, his Bones remained at Sebaste, and wrought Miracles there
Baron. An. 362. page 56.
. As little Truth is there in his accusing Maximus the Emperor for presuming
to judge of Bishops Causes Baron. An. 385. page 441.
; whereas Maximus his Letter to Siricius (which Baronius records Id. An. 387.
page 474.
) declares, He would call the Bishops to a Council in what City they pleased,
and refer it to them (who were best skilled) to determine these matters. Again,
in order to justify those feigned Relics of Protasius and Gervasius showed
now at Rome, he affirms, That S. Ambrose gave part of them to several Bishops,
and some of them were brought to Rome: Whereas S. Ambrose himself (who knew
best what was done) assures us, He buried the Bodies whole, putting every Joint
in his own order Baron. An. 387. page 468. Collat. cum Ambrose Ep. 85.
. And to name no more, He brags, that Idols were pulled down no where with more
zeal, than at Rome Baron. An. 389, and 390. page 526.
. Yet in the same Page he tells us, There was then newly dedicated an Altar
there for sacrificing to the Heathen Gods: So that we see, designed Falsehoods
are not scrupled by him in things which seem to make for the honor of Rome, or
her Opinions.

. 6. We may also observe, that for the same ends He makes innumerable false
Inferences on purpose to pervert the Truth; thus from S. Augustine's calling
Melchiades, A Father of Christian People, (as every Bishop is) Baronius
concludes, that S. Augustine was for the Popes Supremacy Baron. An. 313.. 29.
: So from Bishops judging in Causes where the People referred their Differences
to them, he frequently infers, A right in Bishops, to judge in Temporal Matters
Baron. An. 319.. 30. item An. 326.. 100 etc. item An. 398. page 61. and 62.
: In like manner from Theodoret's, mentioning a Canon of the Church in general,
and (as his discourse shows) referring to the Canon, which forbids any Bishop
to judge a Cause till both parties were present, Baronius gathers, that the
Pope was supreme over the Bishop of Alexandria, and that by the Canons of Nice
Baron. An. 325.. 128.
. Again, That the Pope was not beholding to the Council of Nice for his
Supremacy, which he had from Christ, he proves by Pope Nicholas his Testimony,
who had the impudence in his own Cause and for his own Ends, to tell this Story
Five hundred years after Id. ib.. 130.
: So he condemns the Arians, for ejecting Bishops without staying for the
Bishop of Rome's Sentence, which he proves was unjust by an Epistle of Pope
Julius, which says, The Arians should first have writ to all Bishops, that so
what was right might be determined by all Baron. An. 336.. 34.
; where Julius arrogates nothing to himself alone, as Baronius falsely pretends.
And to make this single Privilege of Rome the more credible, he does
frequently apply what the Ancients say of all the Bishops of the West, to the
Pope: Thus what S. Basil says of all the Western Churches, he applies only to
Rome Baron. An. 371. page 239.
: And when he recites two Epistles of S. Basil, whose Title is to the Western
Bishops, and the whole discourse in it directed to many Bishops, he feigns the
Name of the Pope is left out or lost, and concludes these Letters were
peculiarly directed to him, and this only to support the Roman Supremacy Baron.
An. 371. page 238, and An. 372. page 269, 270, 271, etc.
; and therefore he repeats over and over this matter, and affirms, it was an
Embassy sent to the Pope Ibid. 273, 274.
. Thus also when S. Ambrose says, The Western Bishops by their Judgment
approved of his Ordination: He infers that S. Ambrose implies, It was confirmed
by a public Decree of the Apostolical See Baron. An. 375. page 320.
. And whereas Basil speaking of those Western Bishops in his time, who (he
says) kept the Faith entirely; Baronius infers from hence, That their
Successors, and especially the Bishops of Rome, have never erred since Baron.
An. 372. page 276. and An. 373. page 310.
. Like to which is his inferring the usage of Praying to Saints from a pure
Rhetorical flourish of Nazianzen's, in one of his Orations Baron. An. 372. page
285.
. And thus when S. Hierom uses all his Oratory to set off Virginity, because
that seems to make for the Roman Celibacy, he takes him to be in good earnest,
and will have all his Reflections upon Marriage to be solid Arguments Baron. An.
382. page 402.
, though S. Hierom himself calls them Trifles Baron. An. 350. page 540.
. But when he tells a sober Truth about the Ignorance of the Roman Clergy, then
the Cardinal tells us, He speaks by way of Hyperbole Idem An. 385. page 435.
. From which Instances it does appear, that our Annalist did not, like an
Historian, endeavor to declare Truth, but only to serve an Interest and a
Party.

. 7. Lastly, His Partiality notoriously appears wherever the Church of Rome is
any way concerned; for when any thing of this kind comes in his way, he puts
off the Character of an Historian and turns Disputant, laboring to confute the
most ancient and authentic Authors, if they seem to say any thing against that
Church. Thus we may observe what tedious digressions he makes about the Primacy
of Rome in his discourse on the Nicene Council, for which he twice makes
Apologies Baron. An. 325.. 136, and 140.
. Again, he runs out into a long and very impertinent dispute about the Worship
of Images, in an Age when no good Author mentions them as used in the Church
Baron. An. 362. page 18.
. In like manner, He makes a long excursion to disprove an Authentic Story of
Epiphanius, tearing a Veil with a Picture wrought in it, because such things
were not fit to be in Churches Baron. An. 392. p. 568.
; and he scarce ever meets with any of the Roman Corruptions, mentioned in the
most fabulous Authors, but he leaves the History, and enlarges into Remarks
upon those Passages. But if the Writer be never so eminent, that touches any of
these Sores, his business always is, to baffle the Evidence; of which there is
scarce one year in his Annals, wherein there are not some Examples. On the
other side, He takes every slight occasion to make the most spiteful Reflections
on all that he counts Enemies to the Roman Church: Thus he applies the Bishop
of Alexandria's description of the Arians to the Reformed Churches, though it
agree much better with these of his own Religion Baron. An. 318.. 30.
. Again, He reviles us, because we do not honor the Modern idle lewd Monks of
their Communion, as much as the Ancients did those holy and devout Monks, which
were in the Primitive Times, though it be plain to all the World, these are
like them in nothing but the Name Baron. An. 340.. 10. item An. 363. p. 132.
. The like Outcry he makes upon Protestants, for undeceiving some of those
silly Nuns, who have been decoyed into unlawful Vows, merely for Interest and
Secular Ends; and affirms the persuading these to Marry, is worse than the
Arian's ravishing and murdering them at Alexandria Baron. An. 326.. 29.
. Thus also he compares the Reformed Divines to the Eunomians, who taught,
Their Faith alone would save them, though their Lives were never so wicked
Baron. An. 360.. 38.
; forgetting that their Priest's convert (as they call it) Murderers at the
Gallows, by teaching them this very Principle. And, to name no more Examples,
when S. Basil inveighs against those who despised the Ancient Customs of the
Primitive Church, He spitefully applies this to the Reformed Baron. An. 363.
page 131.
. Whereas in very Truth, they of Rome have left off more Ancient Rites, and
brought in more new ones, than any sort of Christians in the World. By these
and many more Instances which might be given, even out of this one Century, it
is evident, that the whole design of his History is to make all the Doctrins
and Practices of Rome seem to be Primitive and right, and that he cares not how
unlawful the Means be which he uses, to gain this belief in his Reader.

. Yet to conclude, we will observe, That after all his evil-Methods there are
many things which he could neither avoid relating, nor yet excuse, which
condemn the Modern Roman Church. I wonder how he could Commend Constantine for
abolishing the Stews, and the prostituting of Christian Women there; and not
observe, That the Pope now tolerates these Abominations in Rome it self Baron
An. 314.. 74.
. Again, how does it agree with the INFALLIBILITY of the Pope, to say, That one
Holy Spirit governs the Catholic Church, so as to make the Bishops of all Ages
and Places agree in the same Opinion Id. Ib.. 76.
? If this be so, what need one Bishop alone be made Infallible? And if it be
(as he says) a Doct in taught by the Apostles, and consequently true, That the
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father; then the Pope, who condemns this as an
Heresy of the Greeks, is not Infallible Baron. An. 325.. 70.
. If Constantine had known of this Infallibility lodged at Rome, he would have
sent thither for exact Copies of the Holy Scriptures, and not to Eusebius in
Palestina Baron. An. 330.. 23.
. If Damasus had this Infallible Spirit, how came he (after he was Pope) to
need to be instructed in the meaning of Scripture by S. Hierom Baron. An. 379.
page 353.
? Or, if his Successor Siricius had been Infallible, how could the Origenists
(who held such palpable Heresies, that a Woman discovered them to be in an
Error) impose upon his Simplicity; and get Letters Testimonial from this sole
Judge of Heresy Baron. An. 397. page 32.
? How came the Council of Alexandria to send their Decrees to Epiphanius, S.
Hierom and S. Chrysostom, and not first send them to Anastasius, who was
Infallible? And indeed Baronius cannot prove they were sent to him at all, but
by saying, It is fit to believe, they were sent Baron. An. 399. p. 85. cum 88.
. Moreover, many things in this Century related by these Annals, look not
favorably upon the SUPREMACY. Constantine calls Eusebius's Election to the Sea
of Antioch, An advancement to the Bishopric of the Universal Church Baron. An.
324.. 152.
, which looks as if he knew nothing of the Pope's Pretenses: That Marcellus of
Ancyra, even when he was accused before Pope Julius, should call him his
Fellow-Minister, would have been very Saucy, if he had known Julius to be the
Supreme Bishop of the World Baron. An. 341.. 51.
. And if this Supremacy had been owned in former Ages, how came the Eastern
Bishops to be so angry at their being desired to come to Rome Baron. An. 341..
56, and 57.
; yea, how came they to Excommunicate the Pope, for communicating with one whom
they had judged a Criminal Id. An. 347.. 64.
? It is not concerning the Pope, but Athanasius, that Nazianzen says, He did
again prescribe Laws to the whole World Baron. An. 362. page 66.
: It seems the Pope was not the Supreme Caller of Synods, when S. Hierom
(speaking of a Council which he thought was not Authentic) Asks, What Emperor
ordered it to be Convened Eod. An. page 80.
. We cannot find in any genuine Antiquity in this Age, so great an Encomium of
Rome, as Nazianzen the Elder gives of Caesarea, viz. That from the beginning it
was, and now is accounted the Mother of almost all Churches, on which all the
Christian World casts its Eye, like a Circle drawn from a Center Baron. An.
369. page 194.
. A man would guess the Pope's Authority reached no further than the
Suburbicarian Regions, because Ursicinus (Damasus his Competitor) was forbid by
the Emperor from entering into Rome, or the Suburbicarian Regions Baron. An.
371. page 235.
. S. Basil was very unmannerly, if not unjust (had this Supremacy been then
claimed) to send his first Embassy unto Athanasius, and tell him, that He had
the Care of all the Churches Baron. An. eod. p. 236, 237, etc.
; yea afterward, when he did send into the West, he directs his Epistle to the
Italian and Gallican Bishops, without mentioning the Pope in particular: And
truly Damasus (if he were Supreme) took little care of his Office, since upon
so pressing Occasions he would neither Answer S. Basil, nor S. Hierom for a
long time. And S. Hierom was somewhat bold when he reproves the Ambition of
Rome, and said, He would Follow no Chief but Christ Bar. An. 372. page 281, 282.
. S. Ambrose also seems not to give that deference to the Mother of all
Churches that he ought, since he often Dined and made Feasts on the Saturday,
which was a Fast at Rome Baron. An. 375. page 321.
; and had the Pope then been Supreme, why did Ambrose make a Bishop at Sirmium,
in Illyria, so far from his own City of Milan Idem. An. 380. page 362.
? The same S. Ambrose also speaks of Supreme Bishops in Gallia Baron. An. 392.
p. 558.
. It is strange that Siricius, the Supreme Pastor should let the Pagans set up
an Altar to the Goddess of Victory in the Roman Capitol, and that S. Ambrose
should be the only Complainant in this Case Id. eod. An. page 560.
. Finally, if the Pope then had any Jurisdiction over the Eastern Churches, why
was not he consulted about Ordaining S. Chrysostom Bishop of Constantinople?
and how came the Patriarch of Alexandria to be sent to, and to Ordain him
Baron. An. 397. page 44.
? These Instances show, the Supremacy of Rome was unknown in that Age: And so
was the INVOCATION of SAINTS and ADORING of RELICS also, as one might suspect
by these Passages, That the Holy Men of those Ages, in their Dangers and
Necessities are said only to have prayed to God, not to the Blessed Virgin, or
to Saints and Angels for help: So did Alexander Bishop of Constantinople
against Arius Baron. An. 336.. 47.
; so did Parthenius against the Pagans An. 337.. 41.
; so did Constantius the Emperor, for Recovery of his Health An. 338.. 11.
; so also did those Persian Martyrs An. 343.. 16.
. Thus Euphrates, an Eminent Bishop, implores only the help of Christ against
an illusion of the Devil An. 348.. 9.
. The Christians who translated the Bones of Babylas the Martyr, did not Pray
to him, but Praised God An. 362. page 40.
; and Macedonius, an holy Monk, is observed only to call upon God Night and Day
An. 388. page 477.
. Arcadius the Emperor in an Earthquade prayed to the Lord, the only preserver
of the Humble An. 396. page 21.
. Porphyrius, Bishop of Gaza, and his People, called only upon Christ, not upon
any Saints An. 398. page 71.
: So that all these used the Protestant way of Worship. And the Romanists must
be very unsafe in their Worship of Saints, since Baronius confesses, one of
their Catalogues of Saints puts in the Names of two Heretics, as good Catholic
Saints Baron. An. 340.. 41. and An. 341.. 11.
. So also as to the Adoration of Relics, the Faithful in Persia did not keep
the Body of their Martyr to Worship, but buried it in a Tomb An. 343.. 16.
. So S. Anthony the Primitive Hermit, fearing and disliking this Superstition,
ordered his Body to be put into a private and unknown Grave, according to the
Custom of the Catholic Church Baron. An. 358.. 23.
; and therefore Metaphrastes his sole Evidence will not pass, for the Legend of
translating the Bodies of S. Andrew and S. Luke to Constantinople Ibid.. 25.
. It Is true, this Superstition was then creeping in, and some Cheaters did
begin to sell the Bones of False Martyrs (a Trade used at Rome for many Ages);
but Theodosius his Law severely punished this Crime Baron. An. 386. page 455.
: Which ridiculous Imposture, Julian the witty Apostate had justly exposed some
years before, as being contrary to Scripture and to the Christian Law Id. An.
362. page 92. and An. 361. p. 36.
.

To proceed, Had the Altars been then used to be adorned with IMAGES, as they
are now at Rome, the Faithful would not have been so surprised at bringing in
an Image, and placing it on the Altar, as Optatus says they were Baron. An.
348.. 33.
; and Baronius can find no Precedent for carrying Images in Procession to
procure Rain, but the Pagan Superstition Baron. An. 362. page 60.
. In S. Ambroses time the Virgins Apartment in the Church was not adorned with
Pictures or Images, but (after the Protestant way) with Sentences of Holy
Scripture Baron. An. 377. page 327.
. Theodosius should have excepted the Images of the Saints, when he forbad the
honoring any Images void of Sense, with lighting Tapers, offering Incense and
Garlands to them Baron. An. 392. page 562.
: So that doubtless this is an INNOVATION in their Church, and so are many
other of their Rites. The Pope's Bull, to choose a Stranger to be Bishop of a
Church, whereof he never had been a Member, was unknown when Pope Julius
condemned this Practice Baron. An. 341.. 17.
. The Custom of putting the Wafer in the Communicant's Mouth (as Baronius
confesses) was unknown in this Century, when (Protestant like) they took it
into their hands Baron. An. 361. p. 2.
. In S. Augustine's time the People at Rome Fasted on Wednesdays which use they
have now left off Baron. An. 388. page 495.
. When the Rites of Burial used at Christian Funerals are described by
Nazianzen (on occasion of the Funeral of Caesarius) there is no mention of any
Prayers for his Soul; for that Superstition was not then allowed Baron. An.
368. page 179.
. The carrying a Cross before them in Procession, cannot be made out in this
Age, but by the spurious Acts of Martyrs cited by Metaphrastes Baron. An. 398.
p. 71.
. But lest I tire the Reader, I will conclude with one or two Instances more,
to show the difference between Modern Rome and this Age: Their Monks now are
not like those of that time, but resemble the Messalian Heretics, who pretended
to Pray continually, and never used any labor, and claimed all men's Alms as
due only to them; who said, that Marriages might be dissolved, seducing
Children from their Parents, and boasting they were pure from Sin; yea, wearing
Sackcloth, that all may see it Baron. An. 361.. 35, ad. 39.
. Theodosius made a Law to banish Monks from Cities, and oblige them to retire
into Desert places Baron. An. 390. page 537.
: But the Modern Monks are all for Noble Seats in the best frequented Cities;
so that these and those are vastly different. Finally, He makes the Persecuting
Spirit of Macedonius, and the Patience of Athanasius, a mark to distinguish
Truth from Heresy: Now, if we apply this Mark; as none are greater Persecutors
than the Romanists, so we must conclude none are further from the Truth Baron.
An. 360.. 27, and 28.
.

And now by these few Instances, within the compass of one Century, the Reader
may judge what Truth there can be in that Religion, that needs so many Frauds
to hide its Faults; and what trust can be given to that Historian, who to serve
an ill Cause, makes no scruple to use all these kinds of Deceit. This may warn
all that design to peruse these Annals, not to rely upon any of his Authorities
or Arguments without examining, and also not to take every thing for Primitive
and Ancient, which he pretends to be so. This may suffice for this Volume, and
(if we proceed) we shall make the like Remarks on the following Tomes; to show,
that their Religion is made up of Falsehoods, and cannot be defended without
Lying and Forgery, which is the great support of their Evil Cause.

FINIS.
Glory be to the GOD of Truth.
