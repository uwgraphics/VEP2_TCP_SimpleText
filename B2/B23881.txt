A SPEECH Made by the Right Honorable the Earl of ARRAN, to the Scotch
Nobility and Gentry, Met together at the Council Chamber in White Hall, on the
Eighth of January 1688, about an Address to His Highness the PRINCE of ORANGE,
to take upon him the Government of the Kingdom of SCOTLAND.
MY LORDS.
I Have all the Honor and Deferrence for the Prince of ORANGE imaginable. I
think him a Brave Prince, and that we own him great Obligations, in
Contributing so much for our Delivery from Popery. But while I pay him those
Praises, I cannot Violate my Duty to my Master. I must distinguish between his
Popery and his Person. I dislike the one, but have sworn and do owe Allegiance
to the other; which makes it impossible for me to sign away that which I cannot
forbear believing is the KING my Master's Right. For his present absence from
us, by being in France, can no more affect our Duty, than his longer absence
from us in Scotland has done all this while.

My Lords,

LONDON, Printed for T. J. 1689.
