A PANEGYRIC UPON OATS
SILVESTREM TENUI MUSAM MEDITEMUR AVENA.
OF all the Grain our Nation yield's
In Orchards, Gardens, or in Fields,
There is a Grain, (which tho it is common)
Its Worth till now, was known to no man
Not Ceres Sicle 'ere did Crop,
A Grain with Ears of greater hope;
For why? some say, the Earth n'ere bore
In any Clime, such Seed before.
Yet this Grain has (as all must own)
To Grooms and Ostlers well bin known;
And often has, without disdain,
In Musty Barn and Manger layn;
As if it had bin only good
To be for Birds and Beasts the Food:
But now by new inspired force
It keeps alive both Man and Horse
Speak then, my Muse, for now we guess,
What Grain it is, thou would express.
It is not Barley, Rye, or Wheat,
That can pretend to such a Feat;
It Is Oats, bare Oats, which is become
The Health of England, Bane of Rome,
And Wonder of all Christendom.
And therefore Oats has well deserved,
From Musty Barn to be preferred,
And now in Royal Court preserved;
That, like Hesperian Fruit, Oats may
Be watched and Guarded night and Day;
Which is but just Retaliation
For having Guarded a whole Nation.
Hence every lofty Plant which stands
'Twixt Barwick Walls and Dover Sands,
The Oak it self, which well we style
The Pride and safeguard of our Isle,
Must Wave and Strike its lofty Head,
And now Salute an Oaten Reed:
For surely Oats deserves to be
Exalted far 'bove any Tree.
The Egyptians once (though it seems odd)
Did worship Onyons for a God;
And poor peeled Garlic was with them
Esteemed beyond the greatest Gemm.
What would they' done, had they, think ye
Had such a Blade of Oats as we?
Oats of such known Divinity!
Since then by Oats such good we find,
Let Oats at least now be enshrined,
Or in some sacred Press enclosed
Be only kept to be exposed;
And all fond Relics else, shall be
Deemed Objects of Idolatry.
Popelings may tell us, how they saw
Their Garnet's Picture on a Straw;
'Twas a Great miracle we know
To see him drawn in little so,
But on an Oaten Stalk, there is
A greater miracle than this,
A Visage, which with lively Grace
Does Twenty Garnets now Outface,
And like Twig of Dodona's Grove
Ev'en speak's as if inspired by Jove.
Nay, to add to the Wonder more,
Declares unheard of Things before,
And Thousand mysteries does unfold,
As plain as Oracles of old;
By which we steer affairs of State,
And stave off Britain's sullen Fate.
Let Us then, in honor of the name
Of Oats enact some Solemn Game,
Where Oaten Pipe shall us inspire
Beyond the Charms of Orpheus Lyre;
Stones, Stocks and every Senceless thing
To Oats shall dance, to Oats shall sing.
Whilst Woods amazed to the Ecchos ring.
And as (that Hero's names may not
When they are rotten; be forgot)
We hang Achievements o'^e their Dust;
(A debt to their great merits just:)
So if Deserts of Oats we prize,
Let Oats still hang before our eyes;
Thereby to raise our Contemplation,
Oats being to this Happy Nation
The Mystic Emblem of Salvation.
FINIS.
