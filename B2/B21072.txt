The Deceived Virgin, OR THE Treacherous Young LOVERS Cruelty.
Being a New Song Sung at Windsor: By E. G.
Fair Maids Beware, for Men has Oily Tongues,
And Smoothly Court you to your greatest Wrongs,
With Curses, Oaths, large Promises to Boot,
They Will Importune you to Admit the Suit,
But you are Fools I Will Swear by Gad if e're you do it.
A good Sword, or Stick, if you will but take the Pain,
Will Force that Right which you but Court in Vain.
To the Tune of Celia my Foe.
Entered according to Order.

COme Hither all you,
Who to Love never knew;
Here Is a Ditty,
Both Witty
And Wondrous true,
Such a one that will make
Your sad Hearts for to Ache
When I tell ye
What befell me
For my true Loves Sake.
I was a Fair Maid,
And some Beauty I had
Which the Young Men
Came Thronging
To see, and were glad
But amongst all the Rest,
There was one I Loved Best,
Who with pain
Did Obtain
A Large Room in my Breast.
With more Care and more Pain
Then in Seiges was Tain,
To my Chamber,
Through Danger
He constantly came
Where he wasted the Night
In desiring he might,
But at first
I was Cursed
And rejected him quite.
With a Thousand more Oaths,
He heaved up the Clothes
With such strength
That at length
He in Vain did oppose;
But my affections within
Was as Urgent as him,
And with Arder
Did Further
His Fatal design.
When he had gained my Warm Fort,
Which so long he did Court,
He had Leisure
With Pleasure
To Pause on the Sport,
By the Oath of a Kiss,
He Renewed his sweet Bliss,
And Swore
As Before,
I should ever be his.
But Alas! How in Vain,
Does Poor Maidens Complain,
When the Men
Has once Tain
What they wish for again
When their Fair Virgins Flower
Is gone out of their Power,
They may Snatch,
But cannot Catch
At one happy short Hour.
With that we both went
To complete our content
To the Church,
Where with much
Satisfaction we spent
All the time, whilst in Bands,
The Black-Man Joined our hands
Whilst Returning
Both Burning
He squenched our Flames.
Thus Maids may behold,
What it is to be bold,
When in Courting
And Sporting
Your Sweet-Hearts grow Cold,
A good Sword in your Hand,
Will your Affections Command,
Whilst with Sighing
And Crying
Unpittied you Stand.
FINIS.
