AN ESSAY TOWARD The rendering the first Thirty Psalms of David IN METER [OF
the Old Version of Thomas Sternhold, John Hopkins and Others.]

LESS Obnoxious to Exceptions, than it has been; by Moderate Alterations, and
Amendments.

And Published, as a Specimen of the Whole Book, done after the same manner,
now in the Hands of the Author, a Divine of the Church of England.

LONDON, Printed for the Company of Stationers, MDCXCVIII.

AN Advertisement TO THE READER.
IN this Printed Essay, (as well as the rest of the Book, remaining Unprinted)
the Author thinks fit hereby to inform the Reader, that he has Governed
himself by the measures following.

1. That in the whole, the old Rhythm, where tolerable, is generally kept: and
where not tolerable, altered.

2. That obsolete Words are changed for such as now are used.

3. That in other places, where the Language is good, the Words are sometimes
only transposed, either to render the Sense plainer, or the Verse smoother.

4. In Psalms commonly used, especially in the common Tunes, there is very
little alteration made.

5. Where the Sense of the Old Meter varies from that of the New Translation of
the Bible, it is reduced to it, and frequently, in such Cases, the Words of
that Translation, are admitted, if the Meter will bear it.

6. In some Psalms of ordinary use, there is a second Meter added, by only
adding a word, or two in a line.

7. And in some Psalms, by that Addition, to the Old Meter of Eights and Sixes,
the whole for varieties sake is adapted to a new Tune.

8. There are very few Psalms, (scarcely a thir^ part) which, for all these
alterations, continue not as they were in the Old Meter; only some few Word
changed; according to the first and second Particular^ before mentioned.

The Reasons inducing the Author to this Adventure, and some farther
Particulars relating to this Corrected Version, are not here added: though they
are ready; because that would have made the (...) of this Essay too large: and
therefore ^he reserv^^ them to accompany the entire Copy, if it be call^^ for.

THE Psalms of David IN METER.
Beatus vir. Psalm i.
T. S.

To walk, who does forbear:
Nor stands with Sinners in their way;
Nor sits in scorners chair.

Does fix his chief delight:
And it to study does employ
His thoughts both day and night.

to watercourse near:
Which brings forth pleasant fruits, to fit
the seasons of the year:
Whose Leaf, through drought, does never fall;
but flourish still, and stand:
Even so shall all things prosper well,
which this man takes in hand.

shall miss in what they do:
And prove like chaff, which from the earth
winds scatter to and fro.

before God's bar upright:
No sinners there, among the just,
shall dare appear in sight.

which now he owns, will crown:
Whereas ungodly men in theirs,
shall perish with his frown.
Psalm. i.
The same, to another Tune.

As those advise, who wicked are;
Nor in the way of sinners stand:
Nor sets himself in scorners Chair:

Does fix his soul's entire delight:
And it to study, does employ
His musing thoughts, both day and night.

To constant watercourse near:
Which duly brings forth pleasant fruit,
At proper seasons of the year.
Whose Leaf, through drought, does never fall
But fresh and green at all times stand;
Even so shall all things prosper well,
Which such a man does take in hand.

Shall never obtain in what they do:
But rather prove like chaff; which, winds
From the earth do scatter to and fro.

Before God's judgment seat upright:
Nor shall the sinners with the just,
At his assize, appear in sight.

Which now he owneth, then will crown:
Whereas the ungodly shall in theirs,
For ever perish with his frown.
Quare fremuerunt. Psalm ii.
T. S.
Gentiles tumults raise?
What rage did heat their brain?
Why did the Jewish people spend
their thoughts on things so vain?

And make their feeble pride a scorn

T. S.

which vex, and grieve me sore:

"God cannot him restore.

I greatest dangers dread:
My glory thou maintain'st, and do
hold up my drooping head.

I did devoutly cry:
And he out of his holy hill,
did hear me graciously.

I slept; and rose again:
And found my self in safety; for
The Lord did me sustain,

No numbers should my courage quell,
whilst God does give me aid.

Who when great foes against me gnasht

From whom, his people still partake

To whom, enlarged from great distress,

For I to thee, my proved friend,

Why wander ye in vanity,
and follow after lies?

T. S.

T. S.

And heal me; for my very bones

And will me hear again, when I

And make them, with defeatment vexed,

Psalm vi.
The same in another Meter.

I prostrate at thy feet, desire:
Nor in thy fury chasten me,
Which I by sin have set on fire.

In tender mercy me forbear:
And heal me; for my very bones
Within me, sorely vexed are.

And vexed very grievously:
But Lord, how long will thou delay,
To cure my woeful malady?

O save me, not for my deserts;
But for thy tender mercies sake.

And who shall give thee thanks, within
The lodgings of the silent grave?

That I therewith am wondrous faint:
And all the night, I swim my bed
In tears, which back my sad complaint.

Continual grief has spent it so:
Whiles they that are my deadly foes,
Still plot, my life to overthrow.

Vile workers of iniquity:
Because the Lord has heard the voice
Of my complaint, and bitter cry.

I eased the troubles of my heart:
And so will do again, when I
My griess to him again impart.

Till they, with sore defeatment vexed,
Turn backward, faster than they came.

For by the righteous God, the hearts
and reins of men are tried.

With all such, to preserve them safe,

the righteous Judge does try:
But every day, his wrath against
the wicked, boyleth high.

God whets his sword to smite:
And bends his bow, the obstinate

To pierce them through, that persecute

But of the mischief there conceived,

But fell himself, into the pit,

Domine Deus noster. Psalm. viii.
T. S.

that thou do take such care?
Or what his issue, that to them
so kind thy visits are?

With glory great, and dignity

And at his feet laid all below,

Most glorious in them does thy name
through all the earth appear.
Psalm viii.
The same in a different Meter.

Thy name on earth is every where
Yea, thou have set thy glorious throne
Far higher than the heavens clear.

In feeblest creatures to disclose.

And view the moon, and all the stars,
Where they by thee disposed, stand.

Or, what is his issue, that to them
So very kind thy Visits are?

Then heavenly angels in degree:
And on his head, a glorious crown
Bestowed is, O Lord, by thee.

On earth, of all thy works of wonder:
And at his feet laid all things there,
With ample power to keep them under.

Wild deserts live by daily prey:
With fowls of the air, and fish, which make
themselves in pathless seas a way.

Thy works proclaim thee every where!
Through all the earth, they make thy name
Most glorious, like thy self, appear.
Confitebor tibi Domine. Psalm. ix.
T. S.

I will proclaim thy praise:
And publish all thy wondrous works,

And tune my voice, thy name to praise,
in cheerful melody.

They fell down flat, and were destroyed,

Who justly from thy royal throne,

That where they lived, their memory
for ever shall be drowned.

And with impartial equity,

And will to them a refuge be,

Stand'st now so far from thine?
Not suffering, in our troubles great,

And lift thy hand, to show thou mind'st

Lord, do thou not abhor it?
Whiles, acting at this rate, they say
"in heart, thou car'st not for it:

For friendless men, and orphans, do

Search out, and punish all their crimes,

T. S.

Who shall inhabit still?
Or whom will thou receive, to dwell
upon thy holy hill?

Who speaks truth, and in his heart

Although his bargain such do prove,

Or, whom will thou admit, to fix
His dwelling on thy holy hill?

Whose works are strictly just, and straight
Who speaks truth: and in his heart
Does harbor no concealed deceit.

Nor willingly false tales receives,
Which wrongfully impair his fame:

As justly they deserve, contemn:
But, where he sees men fearing God;
Though mean, he greatly honors them.

Although he find his bargain such,
That he is like to lose thereby:

Where money should be freely lent:
Who never will with bribes be bought,
To wrong a person innocent.

From fear of threatened dangers, may,
Upon him now, and ever rest.

And save me from the wicked, whom

From worldly men, whose portion is

With waters black, in stormy clouds

And hailstones from the shattered cloud
