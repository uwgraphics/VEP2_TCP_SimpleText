A Noble Marquess,
As he did ride a Hunting,
hard by a Forest side,
A Fair and comely Maiden,
As she did sit a Spinning,
his gentle Eye espied:
Most-fair and lovely
And of comely grace was she,
although in simple attire,
She sung full sweetly,
With pleasant Voice melodiously,
which set the Lord's heart on fire.
The more he looked, the more he might,
Beauty bred his Heart's delight:
And to his Damsel
then he went with speed,
God speed, quoth. he, thou famous. Flower,
Fair Mistress of this homely Bower,
Where Love and Virtue
dwells with sweet content.
With comely Gesture
And modest mild Behavior,
she bids him welcome then,
She entertained him
In faithful friendly manner,
and all his Gentlemen:
The Noble Marquess
In his Heart felt such a flame,
which set his Senses all at strife,
Quoth he, Fair Maiden,
Show me soon what is thy Name,
I mean to make thee my Wife.
Grissel is my Name, quoth she,
Far unfit for your degree,
A silly Maiden,
and of Parents poor,
Nay, Grissel thou art rich, he said,
A virtuous fair and comely Maid;
Grant me thy love,
and I will ask no more.
At length she consented,
And being both contented,
they married were with speed;
Her Country russet
Was changed to Silk and Velvet,
as to her state agreed:
And when that she
Was timely tried in the same,
her Beauty shined most bright,
Far staining every other
Fair and Princely Dame,
that did appear in sight:
Many envied her therefore,
Because she was of Parents poor,
And 'twixt her Lord and she
great strife did raise:
Some said this, and some said that,
And some did call her Begger's Brat,
And to her Lord
they would her often dispraise.
O Noble Marquess.
Quoth they, why d^st thou wrong us,
thus basely for to wed,
Who might have gotten
An honorable Lady
into your Princely Bed?
Who will not now
Your noble Issue soon deride,
which shall hereafter be born,
That are of Blood so base
Born by the Mother's side?
the which shall bring them in score
Put her therefore quite away,
And take to you a Lady gay,
Whereby your Lineage
may renowned be.
Thus every day they seemed to prate,
That malic'd Grissel's good Estate;
Who all this while
took it most patiently.
