A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL PAPERS Relative to the HISTORY OF THE Colony of
Massachusets-Bay.

BOSTON, NEW ENGLAND: Printed by THOMAS and JOHN FLEET, 1769.

The PREFACE.
THE natural increase of people upon the British continent of North America is
so great as to make it highly probable that in a few generations more a mighty
Empire will be formed there.

The rise and progress of the several Colonies, of which this Empire will be
constituted, will be subjects of entertainment for speculative and ingenious
minds in distant ages.

He who rescues from oblivion interesting historical facts is beneficial to
posterity as well as to his contemporaries, and the prospect thereof to a
benevolent mind causes that employment to be agreeable and pleasant which
otherwise would be irksome and painful.

The papers of which this volume consists are intended to support and elucidate
the principal facts related in the first part of the History of
Massachusets-Bay, and may serve as an Appendix to it.

The author of that History was possessed of many other ancient and very
curious original papers, which are irrecoverably lost by an unfortunate event,
sufficiently known.

If this Collection shall be favorably received, another volume of Papers will
probably be published, to serve as an Appendix to the second part of the same
History.

Massachusetts Colony Charter. This first Charter of the Massachusetts Colony has
never been printed. There are very few Manuscript Copies of it. Those are
liable to so many accidents that it is thought proper to publish it as the most
likely means of preventing it is being irrecoverably lost.

The true coppie of the agreement at Cambridge, August 26. 1629.
UPON due consideration of the state of the plantation now in hand for New
England, wherein we (whose names are hereunto subscribed) have engaged
ourselves: and having weighed the greatness of the work in regard of the
consequence, God's glory and the churches good: As also in regard of the
difficultyes and discouragements which in all probabilityes must be forecast
upon the execution of this business: Considering withal that this whole
adventure grows upon the joint confidence we have in each others fidelity and
resolution herein, so as no man of us would have adventured it without
assurance of the rest: Now, for the better encouragement of ourselves and
others that shall join with us in this action, and to the end that every man
may without scruple dispose of his estate and afayres as may best fit his
preparation for this voyage, it is fully and faithfully agreed amongst us, and
every of us does hereby freely and sincerely promise and bind himself in the
word of a christian and in the presence of God who is the searcher of all
hearts, that we will so really endeavor the execution of this work, as by
God's assistance we will be ready in our persons, and with such of our several
familyes as are to go with us, and such provision as we are able conveniently
to furnish ourselves withal, to embarke for the said plantation by the first
of March next, at such port or ports of this land as shall be agreed upon by
the Company, to the end to pass the seas (under God's protection) to inhabit
and continue in New England. Provided always, that before the last of September
next the whole government together with the patent for the said plantation be
first by an order of court legally transferred and established to remain with
us and others which shall inhabit upon the said plantation. And provided also
that if any shall be hindered by such just and inevitable let or other cause
to be allowed by 3 parts of four of these whose names are hereunto subscribed,
then such persons for such times and during such letts to be discharged of this
bond. And we do further promise every one for himself, that shall fail to be
ready through his own default by the day appointed, to pay for every day's
default the sum of 3 l. to the use of the rest of the Company who shall be
ready by the same day and time.

This was done by order of court the 29th of August, 1629. Richard Saltonstall

General considerations for the plantation in New England, with an answer to
several objections.
FIRST, it will be a service to the church of great consequence, to carry the
gospel into those parts of the world, and to raise a bulwark against the
kingdom of Antichrist which the Jesuits labor to rear up in all places of the
world.

Secondly, all other churches of Europe are brought to desolation, and it may
be justly feared that the like judgment is coming upon us; and who knows but
that God has provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he means to
save out of the general destruction.

Thirdly, the land grows weary of her inhabitants, so that man, which is the
most precious of all creatures, is here more vile and base than the earth they
tread upon; so as children, neighbors and friends, especially of the poor,
are counted the greatest burdens which, if things were right, would be the
highest earthly blessings.

Fouthly. We are grown to that excess and intemperance in all excess of riot
as no mean estate almost will suffice to keep sail with his equals, and he
that fayles in it must live in sorrow and contempt. Hence it comes to pass
that all arts and trades are carried in that deceitful manner and unrighteous
course as it is almost impossible for a good upright man to maintain his
chardge and live comfortably in any of them.

Fifthly. The schools of learning and religion are so corrupted, as (besides
the unsupportable chardge of this education) most children, (even the best
wittiest and of fayerest hopes) are perverted, corrupted and utterly over
powered by the multitude of evil examples and licentious governors of those
seminaries.

Sixthly. The whole earth is the Lord's garden and he has given it to the
sons of Adam to be tilled and improved by them, why then should we stand
starving here for places of habitation (many men spending as much labor and
cost to recover or keep sometimes an acre or two of lands, as would procure
him many hundreds of acres, as good or better in another place) and in the
mean time suffer whole countries as profitable for the use of man, to lie
waste without any improvement?

Seventhly. What can be a better work and more noble and worthy a christian,
than to help to raise and support a particular church while it is in its
infancy, and to join our forces with such a company of faithful people, as by
a tymely assistance may grow stronger and prosper, and for want of it may be
put to great hazard if not wholly ruined?

Eighthly. If any such as are known to be godly and live in wealth and
prosperity here, shall forsake all this to join themselves with this church,
and run in hazard with them of hard and mean condition, it will be an
example of great use both for the removing of scandal and sinister and worldly
respects, to give more life to the faith of God's people in their prayers for
the plantation and also to encourage others to join the more willingly in it.

OBJECTIONS.
Object. 1. It will be a great wrong to our own church and country to take
away the best people; and we still lay it more open to the judgments feared.

Ans. 1st The number will be nothing in respect of those that are left. 2dly,
Many that live to no use here, more than for their own private familyes may be
employed to a more common good in another place. 3dly, Such as are of good use
here may yett be so employed as the church shall receive no loss. And since
Christ's coming the church is to be conceived as universal without distinction
of countries, so as he that does good in any one place serves the church in all
places, in regard of the unitye. 4thly, It is the revealed will of God that the
gospel should be preached to all nations, and though we know not whether the
Indians will receive it or not, yet it is a good work to observe God's will in
offering it to them; for God shall have glory by it though they refuse it.

Obj. 2. We have feared a judgment a long time, but yet we are safe; therefore
it were better to stay till it come, and either we may fly then, or if we be
overtaken in it we may well be content to suffer with such a church as ours is.

Ans. It is likely that this consideration made the churches beyond the seas as
the Palatinate and Rochel, etc. to sit still at home, and not look out for
shelter while they might have found it, but the woeful spectacle of their ruin
may teach us more wisdom to avoid the plague while it is foreseen, and not to
tarry as they did till it overtooke them. If they were now at their former
liberty we may be sure they would take other courses for their safety. And
though most of them had miscarried in their escape, yet it had not been half
so miserable to themselves, or scandalous to religion, as this desperate
backsliding and abjuring the truth, which many of the ancient professors among
them, and the whole posterity that remain are plunged into.

Obj. 3. We have here a fruitful land with peace and plenty of all things.

Ans. We are like to have as good conditions there in time; but yet we must
leave all this abundance, if it be not taken from us. When we are in our
graves, it will be all one whether we have lived in plenty or in penury,
whether we have dyed in a bed of down or locks of straw. Only this is the
advantage of the mean condition, that it is a more freedom to dye. And the
less comfort any have in the things of this world, the more liberty they have
to lay up treasure in heaven.

Obj. 4. We may perish by the way or when we come there, having hunger or the
sword, etc. and how uncomfortable will it be to see our wives and children and
friends come to such misery by our occasion?

Ans. Such objections favor too much of the flesh. Who can secure himself or
his from the like calamities here? If this course be warrantable, we may trust
God's providence for these things. Either he will keep those evils from us, or
will dispose them for our good and enable us to bear them.

Obj. 5. But what warrant have we to take that land, which is and has been of
long time possessed of others the sons of Adam?

Ans. That which is common to all is proper to none. This savage people rules
over many lands without title or property; for they enclose no ground, neither
have they cattle to maintain it, but remove their dwellings as they have
occasion, or as they can prevail against their neighbors. And why may not
christians have liberty to go and dwell amongst them in their waste lands and
woods (leaving them such places as they have manured for their corn) as
lawfully as Abraham did among the Sodomites? For God has given to the sons of
men a two-fould right to the earth; there is a natural right and a civil
right. The first right was natural when men held the earth in common, every
man sowing and feeding where he pleased: Then, as men and cattle increased,
they appropriated some parcells of ground by enclosing and peculiar manurance,
and this in time got them a civil right. Such was the right which Ephron the
Hittite had to the field of Machpelah, wherein Abraham could not bury a dead
corpse without leave, though for the out parts of the country which lay
common, he dwelt upon them and took the fruit of them at his pleasure. This
appears also in Jacob and his sons, who fedd their flocks as bouldly in the
Canaanites land, for he is said to be lord of the country; and at Dotham and
all other places men accounted nothing their own, but that which they had
appropriated by their own industry, as appears plainly by Abimelech's servants,
who in their own country did often contend with Isaac's servants about wells
which they had dug; but never about the lands which they occupied. So
likewise between Jacob and Laban; he would not take a kidd of Laban's without
special contract; but he makes no bargain with him for the land where he
fedd. And it is probable that if the country had not been as free for Jacob as
for Laban, that covetuous wretch would have made his advantage of him, and have
upbraided Jacob with it as he did with the rest. 2dly, There is more than
enough for them and us. 3dly, God has consumed the natives with a miraculous
plague, whereby the greater part of the country is left void of inhabitants.
4thly, We shall come in with good leave of the natives.

Obj. 6. We should send our young ones and such as can best be spared, and not
of the best of our ministers and magistrates.

Ans. It is a great work, and requires more skillful artificers to lay the
foundation of a new building, than to uphold and repair one that is already
built. If great things be attempted by weak instruments, the effects will be
answerable.

Obj. 7. We see that those plantations that have been formerly made succeeded
ill.

Ans. The fruit of any public design is not to be discerned by the imediate
success: it may appear in time, that they were all to good use. 2dly, There
were great fundamental errors in others, which are like to be avoided in this:
for 1st there main end and purpose was carnal and not religious. 2d, They
aimed chiefly at profitt and not at the propagation of religion. 3d, They used
too unfitt instruments, a multitude of rude and ungoverned persons, the very
scums of the land. 4th, They did not stablish a right form of government.

A true relation of the last voyage to New England, declaring all circumstances
with the manner of the passage we had by sea, and what manner of country and
inhabitants we found when we came to land; and what is the present state and
condition of the English people that are there already.

Faithfully recorded according to the very truth, for the satisfaction of very
many of my loving friends, who have earnestly requested to be truly notifyed in
these things.

Written from New England July 24. 1629.

Any curious critic that looks for exactnes of phrases, or expert seaman
that regards propriety of sea-termes, may be disappointed.

A true relation of the last voyage to New England, made the last summer, begun
the 25th of April, being Saturday Anno Domini, 1629.

THE Company of New England, consisting of many worthy gentlemen in the city
of London, Dorcester, and other places, aiming at the glory of God, the
propagation of the gospel of Christ, the conversion of the Indians, and the
enlargement of the King's Majesty's dominions in America, and being authorized
by his royal letters patents for that end, at their very great costs and
charges, furnished 5 ships to go to New England, for the further settling of
the English plantation that they had already begun there.

The names of the 5 ships were as follows.

The first is called the Talbot, a good and strong ship of 300 tons, and 19
pieces of ordinance, and served with 30 mariners. This ship carried about an
100 planters, 6 goats, 5 great pieces of ordinance, with meal, oatemeale,
pease, and all manner of munition and provision for the plantation for a twelve
monthe.

The second the George, another strong ship also, about 300 tons, 20 pieces
of ordinance, served with about 30 mariners; her chief carriage were cattle,
12 mares, 30 kyne, and some goats: Also there gad in her 52 planters and other
provision.

The third is called the Lyon's Whelpe, a neat and nimble ship of 120 tons, 8
pieces of ordinance, carrying in her many mariners and about 40 planters,
specially from Dorcester and other places thereabouts, with provision, and 4
goats.

The 4th is called the Four Sisters, as I hear, of about 300 tunns, which
sayme ship carried many cattle, with passengers and provision.

The 5th is called the Mayflower, carrying passengers and provision.

Now amongst these 5 ships, the George having the special and urgent cause of
hastening her passage, set sail before the rest about the middle of April. And
the Four Sisters and the Mayflower, being not thoroughly furnished, intended,
as we heard, to set forth about 3 week after us: But we that were in the Talbot
and the Lyon's Whelpe, being ready for our voyage, by the good hand of God's
providence, hoysted our sail from Graves-end on Saturday the 25th of April,
about 7 o'clock in the morning. Having but a faint wynd we could not go far
that day, but at night we arrived against Leigh, which is 12 miles from
Graves-end, and there we rested that night, and kept Sabbath the next day.

On Monday (the 27th) we sat forward and came to the flatts, a passage somewhat
difficult by reason of the narrownes of the channel and shallownes of the
water; and going over this we were in some danger: for the ship being heavy
laden and drawing deep water was sensibly felt of us all to strike 3 or 4
times on the ground: but the wind blowing somewhat strong we were carried
swiftly on, and at last by God's blessing came safe to ancre at Gorin road.

Tuesday (28th) we went a little further, and ancred over against Margret
down, staying for a wind for the Downs.

Wednesday (29th) we came safely through with much turning and tacking through
the gullies into the Downs, and stayed that night.

Thursday (30th) Friday and Saturday (May 1st and 2d) the wind blew hard from
south west and caused our ship to dance, and diverse of our passengers and my
wiffe specially were sea sick. Here the King's ship called the Assurance,
pressed 2 of our mariners. Here we saw many porpuses playing in the sea, which
they say is a sign of foul weather.

(May 3.) Sabbath day, a windye day and could: We kept Sabbath staying still at
the Downs.

Monday (4th) God sent us a fair gale of wind, North N. East, whereby we came
merrily from the Downs, and passing Dover we saw 6 or 7 sail of Dunkirkers
wafting after us; but it seemed they saw our company was too strong for them,
for then we had with us 3 or 4 ships that went for the Streights: So they
returned back from pursuing us any longer. But sailing with a good wind we
went speedily, and at night came near the Isle of Wight, but being dark, we
durst not put into the channel, but put back for sea-roome 4 hours, and then
other 4 hours sailed back again the same way.

Tuesday (5th) early in the morning we entered the channel, the wind being
weak and calm, and passed by Portsmouth very slowly; but in the afternoon
the wind quickened, and we were forced to ancre a little on this side
Cowcastle, but the wind growing more favorable, we weighed and came to ancre
again, right against Cowcastle, thinking to stay that night, the wind being
very calm. Here I and my wiffe and my daughter Mary, and 2 maids, and some
others with us, obtained of the master of the ship to go a shore to refresh
us, and to wash our linnens, and so we lay at Cowes that night. But the wind
turning when we were absent, they hoysted sail and left us there, and ancred 8
miles further, over against Yarmouth, about 8 of the clock at night.

Wednesday (6th) betyme in the morning the shalope was sent from the ship to
fetch us to Yarmouth; but the water proved rough and our women desired to be
set on shore 3 miles short of Yarmouth, and so went on foot by land and
lodged in Yarmouth that night.

On Thursday and Friday (7th and 8th) there master Becher, allowed by the
Company, gave me 40 s. to make our provision of what things we would for the
voyage.

Saturday (9th) we went to board again; and this day we had 2 other men
pressed to serve the King's ship; but we got one again by entreaty.

The Sabbath next day (10th) we kept the ship, where I preached in the morning;
and in the afternoon was entreated to preach at Yarmouth, where Mr. Meare and
Captain Borley entertained us very kyndly, and earnestly desired to be
satisfied of our safe arrival in New England, and of the state of the country.

Monday morning (11th) blew a fair wind from E.S.E. and the Lion's Whelpe
having taken in all her provision for passengers, about 3 of the clock in the
afternoon we hoysed sail for the Needles, and by God's guidance safely passed
that narrow passage a little after 4 a clock in the afternoon. And being
entered into the sea, from the top of the mast, we discerned 4 sail of ships
lying southward from us. But night coming on we took in our long boat and
shalope. And the next day (12th) we had a fair gale of easterly wind that
brought us toward night as far as the Lizzard.

Wednesday (10th) the wind still houlding easterly, we came as far as the
land's end, in the utmost part of Cornwall, and so left our dear native soil
of England behind us; and sailing about 10 leagues further we passed the Isles
of Scillic and launched the same day a great way into the maine ocean. And now
my wiffe and other passengers began to feel the tossing waves of the western
sea, and so were very sea sick,

And this is to be noted, that all this while our passage has been upon the
coast of England, so ought truly to be accounted the first day of our parting
with Old England.

Thursday (14th) the same easterly wind blew all day and night, and the next
day (15th) so that some of the seamen thought we were come by this time 200
leagues from England, but toward night the wind was calm.

Saturday (16th) we were be calmed all day. This day met us a little ship that
came from Christopher islands.

Sabbath (17th) being the first Lord's day we held at sea was very calm,
especially in the morning, but we were disturbed in our morning service by the
appearance of a Biscayners ship, a man of war, that made toward us, and
manned out his boat to view us: But finding us too strong for him he durst not
venture to assault us, but made off.

This day my two children Samuel and Mary began to be sick of the small pocks
and purples together, which was brought into the ship by one Mr. Brown who was
sick of the same at Graves-end, whom it pleased God to make the first occasion
of bringing that contagious sickness among us, wherewith many were after
afflicted.

Monday (18th) calm still, the wind being N.W. blowing a little toward
evening, but contrary to our course.

Tuesday (19th) wind S. W. as little helpful as the former and blowing very
weak. This day the master of the ship, myself and another went aboard the
Lion's Whelpe, where Mr. Gibs made us welcome with bountiful entertainment.
And this day toward night my daughter grew sicker, and many blew spots were
seen upon her breast, which affrighted us. At the first we thought they had
been the plague tokens; but we found afterward that it was only an high
measure of the infection of the pocks, which were struck again into the
child, and so it was God's will the child dyed about 5 of the clock at night,
being the first in our ship that was buried in the bowels of the great
Atlantic sea; which, as it was a grief to us her parents and a terrrour to all
the rest, as being the beginning of a contagious disease and mortality, so in
the same judgment it pleased God to remember mercy in the child, in forcing it
from a world of misery wherein otherwise she had lived all her days. For being
about 4 years old, a year since, we know not by what means, sweyed in the
back, so that it was broken and grew crooked, and the joints of her hipps were
loosed and her knees went crooked, pitiful to see. Since which she has had a
most lamentable pain in her belly, and would often times cry out in the day and
in her sleep also, my belly! which declared her extraordinary distemper. So
that in respect of her we had cause to take her death as a blessing from the
Lord to shorten her misery.

Wednesday (20th) a wet morning, the wind was W.S.W. and in the afternoon N.W.
by W. both being contrary to our course, which was to sail W.byS. Thus it
pleased God to lay his hand upon us by sickness and death and contrary winds;
and stirred up some of us to make the motion of humbling ourselves under the
hand of God by keeping a solemn day of fasting and prayer unto God, to beseech
him to remove the continuance and further increase of these evils from us,
which was willingly condescended unto as a duty very fitting and needful for
our present state and condition.

Thursday (21st) there being two ministers in the ship, Mr. Smith and myself,
we endeavored, together with others, to consecrate the day as a solemn fasting
and humiliation to Almighty God, as a furtherance of our present work. And it
pleased God the ship was becalmed all day, so that we were freed from any
encumbrance: And as son as we had done prayers, see and behold the goodness of
God, about 7 a clock at night the wind turned to N. E. and we had a fair gale
that night, as a manifest evidence of the Lord's hearing our prayers. I heard
some of the mariners say, they thought this was the first sea-fast that ever
was kept, and that they never heard of the like performed at sea before.

Friday (22d) the wind fair, and east northerly, and for our purpose for New
England. It did blow strongly and carried us on amayne with tossing waves,
which did affright them that were not wonted to such sights.

Saturday (23d) the same wind blowing but more gently. Now we were comforted
with the hope of my son Samuel's recovery of the small pockes.

(24th) The 2d Lord's day, an orderly wind and prosperous.

On Monday (25th) a fair surme gale, the wind S.S.W.

Tuesday (26th) about 10 of the clock in the morning, whilst we were at
prayers a strong and sudden blast came from the north, that hoysed up the waves
and tossed us more than ever before, and beld us all the day till toward night,
and then abated by little and little till it was calm. This day Mr. Goffe's
great dog fell overboard and could not be recovered.

Wednesday (27th) the wind still N. and calm in the morning, but about noone
there arose a So. wind, which increased more and more, so that it proved to us
that are landmen a sore and terrible storm; for the wind blew mightily, the
rain fell vehemently, the sea roared and the waves tossed us horribly; besides
it was fearful dark and the mariners mait was afraid; and noise on the other
side with their running here and there, loud crying one to another to pull at
this and that rope. The waves powered themselves over the ship that the 2 boats
were filled with water, that they were feign to strike holes in the midst of
them to let the water out. Yea by the violence of the waves the long boats
roape which held it was broken, and it had like to have been washed overboard,
had not the mariners with much pain and danger recovered the same. But this
lasted not many hours; after which it became a calmish day. All which while I
lay close and warm in my cabine, but far from having list to sleep with
Jonah; my thoughts were otherwise employed as the time and and place required.
Then I saw the truth of the scripture Psalm. 107. from the 23d to the 32d. And
my fear at this time was the less, when I remembered what a loving friend of
mine, a minister accustomed to sea storms said to me that I might not be
dismayed at such storms, for they were ordinary at sea, and it seldom falls
out that a ship perishes at them if it have sea-roome. Which I the rather
write that others as well as myself by the knowledge hereof may be encouraged
and prepared against these ordinary sea-stormes.

Thursday (28th) So. wind; calm at night.

On Friday (29th) a boistrous wind blowing cross, but was allayed toward
night with a shower of rain.

Saturday (30th) So* wind, but fair and quiett.

Sabbath day (31st) being the 3d Lord's day, fair and calm; we saw abundance
of grampus fishes, 2 or 3 yards long, and a body as bigg as an ox.

Monday (June 1) the wind westerly and calm: But besides our being stayed by
contrary winds we begun to find the temperature of the air to alter and to
become more soletry and subject to unwholesome foggs. For coming now to the
height of the Western Islands, some of our men fell sick of the scurvie and
others of the small pockes, which more and more increased: Yet thanks be to
God none dyed of it but my own child mentioned. And therefore, according to
our great need, we appointed another fast for the next day.

Tuesday (2d) we solemnly celebrate another fast. The Lord that day heard us
before we prayed and gave us an answer before we called; for early in the
morning the wind turned full east, being as fit a wind as could blow. And
sitting at my study on the ship's poope I saw many bonny fishes and porpuses
pursuing one another, and leaping some of them a yard above the water. Also as
we were at prayers under the hatch, some that were above saw a whale puffing up
water not far from the ship. Now my wiffe was pretty well recovered of her
sea-sicknesse.

Wednesday (3d) a fair day and fine gale of full East wind. This day myself
and others saw a large round fish sailing by the ship's side, about a yard in
length and roundeth every way. The mariners called it a sun fish; it
spreads out the sins like beams on every side 4 or 5.

Thursday and Friday (4th and 5th) the wind full E. we were carried with
admiration on our journey. By this we were more than half way to New England.
This day a fish very strange to me, they call it a carvell; which came by the
ship side, wafting along the top of the water. It appeared at the the first
like a bubble above the water as bigg as a man's fist, but the fish itself is
about the bigness of a man's thum, so that the fish itself and the bubble
resemble a ship with sails, which therefore is called a carvell.

Saturday (6th) wind direct East still.

(7th) The 4th Sabbath we kept at sea. The wind easterly till noone, and then
it came full S. E. a strong gale that night and the next day (8th) till night.
Tuesday (9th) the same wind held till 9 a clock in the morning; and then a
great shower which lasted till about 7 at night, and then it was a very calm.
There we sounded with a dipsea line above 100 fadome and found no bottom. This
day we saw a fish called a turkle, a great and large shell fish, swimming above
the water near the ship.

Wednesday (10th) wind northerly, a fine gale but calmish in the afternoon.

Thursday (11th) the wind at N. an easy gale and fair morning. We saw a
mountain of ice shining as white as snow like to a great rock or clift on
shore, it stood still and therefore we thought it to be on ground and to reach
the bottom of the sea. For though there came a mighty stream from the north
yet it moved not, which made us sound, and we found a bank of 40 fathom deep
whereupon we judged it to rest: and the height above was as much. We saw also 6
or 7 pieces of ice, floating on the sea, which was broken off from the former
mountain. We also saw great store of water foul swimming by the shipp within
musket shot, of a pyde color and about the bigness of a wild duck, about 40
in a company. The mariners call them hag birds. Toward night came a fogge,
that the Lions Whelp was lost till morning. And now we saw many bony fish
porpuses and grampuses every day more and more.

Friday (12th) Foggie and calmish, the wind northerly in the morning, but about
noon it came S. E. a dainty loome gale which carried us 6 leagues a watch.

Saturday (13th) the same wind till night, and we saw great store of porpuses
and grampuses.

The 5th sabbath, (14th) the same wind, toward noon it began to be foggie, and
then it rained till night, we went 4 or 5 leagues a watch.

Monday (15th) a fair day but foggie, the same wind blowing but with fresh
gales carried us 7 leagues a watch. In the afternoon it blew harder, so the sea
was rough, and we lost the sight of the Whelpe: it being foggie we drummed for
them, and they shot of a great piece of ordinance, but we heared not one
another.

Tuesday (16th) wind S. by E. foggie till about 10 a clock. While we were at
prayers it cleared up about an hour, and then we saw the Lion's Whelpe,
distant about 2 leagues southward, we presently tackt about to meet her, and
she did the same to meet us, but before we could get together a thick fogge
came, that we were long in finding each other. This day we sounded diverse
times, and found ourselves on another bank, at first 40 fathom, after 36,
after 33, after 24. We thought it to have been the bank over against Cape
Sable, but we were deceived, for we knew not certainly where we were because of
the fogge. After 3 or 4 hours company we lost the Lion's Whelpe again, and
beat the drum and shot of a great piece of ordinance, and yet heard not of
them. But perceiving the bank to grow still shallower we found it 27 and 24
fathoms. Therefore, being a fogg, and fearing we were too near land we tackt
about for sea-roome for 2 or 3 watches, and steered southeast.

Wednesday (17th) very foggie still, and wind S. by W. and sounding found no
bottom that we could reach.

Thursday (18th) wind full W. and contrary to us. This day a notorious wicked
fellow that was given to swering and boasting of his former wickedness, bragged
that he had got a wench with child before he came this voyage, and mocked at
our days of fast, railing and jesting against puritans, this fellow fell sick
of the pockes and dyed. We sounded and found 38 fathom, and stayed, for a
little while, to take some cod fish, and feasted ourselves merrily.

Friday (19th) wind West still, a very fair clear day. About 4 a clock in the
afternoon some went up to the top of the mast, and affirmed to our great
comfort they saw land to the northeastward.

Saturday (20th) wind S. W. a fair gale. We sounded and found 40, 30, 22, and
a little after no ground.

Sabbath (21st) being the 6th Lord's day; wind northerly but fair and calm.

Monday (22d) wind easterly, a fair gale. This day we saw a great deal of
froth not far from us: we feared it might be some breach of water against
some rocks, therefore the master of our ship hoisted out the shallop and went
with some of the men to see what it was; but found it only to be a froath
carried by the stream.

Tuesday (23d) the wind N. E. a fair gale.

Wednesday (24th) wind N. E. a fair day and clear; about 9 a clock in the
morning we espied a shipp about 4 leagues behind us; which proved to be the
Lions Whelpe, which had been a week separated from us, we stoped for her
company. This day a child of good man Clarke, which had a consumption before it
came to shipp, died. This day we had all a clear and comfortable sight of
America, and of the Cape Sable that was over against us 7 or 8 leagues
northward. Here we saw yellow gilliflowers on the sea.

Thursday (25th) wind still N. E. a full and fresh gale. In the afternoon we
had a clear sight of many islands and hills by the sea shore. Now we saw
abundance of mackrill, a great store of great whales puffing up water as they
go, some of them came near our shipp: this creature did astonish us that saw
them not before; their back appeared like a little island. At 5 a clock at
night the wind turned S. E. a fair gale. This day we caught mackrill.

Friday (26th) a foggie morning, but after clear and wind calm. We saw many
scools of mackrill, infinite multitudes on every side our ship. The sea was
abundantly stored with rockweed and yellow flowers like gillyflowers. By noon
we were within 3 leagues of Capan, and as we sailed along the coasts we saw
every hill and dale and every island full of gay woods and high trees. The
nearer we came to the shore the more flowers in abundance, sometimes scattered
abroad, sometimes joined in sheets 9 or 10 yards long, which we supposed to be
brought from the low meadows by the tide. Now what with fine woods and green
trees by land, and these yellow flowers paynting the sea, made us all desirous
to see our new paradise of New England, whence we saw such forerunning signals
of fertility afar off. Coming near the harbor toward night we takt about
for sea-roome.

Saturday (27th) a foggie morning; but after 8 o'clocke in the morning very
clear, the wind being somewhat contrary at So. and by West, we tackt to and
again with getting little; but with much ado, about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, having with much pain compassed the harbor, and being ready to
enter the same, see how things may suddenly change! there came a fearful gust
of wind and rain and thunder and lightning, whereby we were borne with no
little terror and trouble to our mariners, having very much ado to loose
down the sails when the fury of the storm held up. But God be praised it
lasted but a while and soon abated again, And hereby the Lord showed us what
he could have done with us, if it had pleased him. But blessed be God, he soon
removed this storm and it was a fair and sweet evening.

We had a westerly wind which brought us between 5 and 6 o'clock to a fine and
sweet harbor, 7 miles from the head point of Capan. This harbor 20 ships may
easily ride therein, where there was an island whither four of our men with a
boat went, and brought back again ripe strawberries and gooseberries, and
sweet single roses. Thus God was merciful to us in giving us a taste and smell
of the sweet fruit as an earnest of his bountiful goodness to welcome us at our
first arrival. This harbor was two leagues and something more from the
harbor at Naimkecke, where our ships were to rest, and the plantation is
already begun. But because the passage is difficult and night drew on, we put
into Capan harbor.

(28th) The Sabbath, being the first we kept in America, and the 7th Lord's day
after we parted with England.

Monday (29th) we came from Capan, to go to Naimkecke, the wind northerly. I
should have told you before that the planters spying our English colors the
Governor sent a shalop with 2 men on Saturday to pilot us. These rested the
Sabbath with us at Capan; and this day, by God's blessing and their directions,
we passed the curious and difficult entrance into the large spacious harbor of
Naimkecke. And as we passed along it was wonderful to behold so many islands
replenished with thick wood and high trees, and many fair green pastures.
And being come into the harbor we saw the George to our great comfort then
being come on Tuesday which was 7 days before us. We rested that night with
glad and thankful hearts that God had put an end to our long and tedious
journey through the greatest sea in the world.

The next morning (30th) the governor came aboard to our ship, and bade us
kindly welcome, and invited me and my wiffe to come on shore, and take our
lodging in his house, which we did accordingly,

Thus you have a faithful report collected from day to day of all the
particulars that were worth noting in our passage.

NOW in our passage diverse things are remarkable.
FIRST, through God's blessing our passage was short and speedy, for whereas we
had 1000 leagues, that is 3000 miles English, to sail from Old to New
England, we performed the same in 6 weeks and 3 days.

Secondly, our passage was comfortable and easy for the most part, having
ordinarily fair and moderate wind, and being freed for the most part from
stormy and rough seas, saving one night only, which we that were not used
thought to be more terrible than indeed it was, and this was Wednesday at night
May 27th.

Thirdly, our passage was also healthful to our passengers, being freed from
the great contagion of the scurvie and other maledictions, which in other
passages to other places had taken away the lives of many. And yet we were in
all reason in wonderful danger all the way, our ship being greatly crowded with
passengers; but through God's great goodness we had none that died of the
pockes but that wicked fellow that scorned at fasting and prayer. There were
indeed 2 little children, one of my own and another beside; but I do not
impute it merely to the passage; for they were both very sickly children, and
not likely to have lived long, if they had not gone to sea. And take this for a
rule, if children be healthful when they come to sea, the younger they are the
better they will endure the sea, and are not troubled with sea-sicknes as older
people are, as we had experience in many children that went this voyage. My
wiffe indeed, in tossing weather, was something ill by vomiting, but in calm
weather she recovered again, and is now much better for the sea sickness. And
for my own part, whereas I have for diverse years past been very sickly and
ready to cast up whatsoever I have eaten, and was very sick at London and
Gravesend, yet from the time I came on shipboard to this day, I have been
straungely healthful. And now I can digest our ship diett very well, which I
could not when I was at land. And indeed in this regard I have great cause to
give God praise, that he has made my coming to be a method to cure me of a
wonderful weak stomach and continual pain of melancholy wynd from the
spleen: Also diverse children were sick of the small pockes, but are safely
recovered again, and 2 or 3 passengers toward the latter end of the voyage
fell sick of the scurvie, but coming to land recovered in a short time.

Fourthly, our passage was both pleasurable and profitable. For we received
instruction and delight in behoulding the wonders of the Lord in the deep
waters, and sometimes seeing the sea round us appearing with a terrible
countenance, and as it were full of high hills and deep vallyes; and sometimes
it appeared as a most plain and even meadow. And ever and anon we saw diverse
kynds of fishes sporting in the great waters, great grampuses and huge whales
going by companies and puffing up water-streames. Those that love their own
chimney corner, and dare not go far beyond their own towns end shall neever
have the honor to see these wonderful works of Almighty God.

Fifthly, we had a pious and christian-like passage; for I suppose passengers
shall seldom find a company of more religious, honest and kind seamen than we
had. We constantly served God morning and evening by reading and expounding a
chapter, singing, and prayer. And the Sabbath was solemnly kept by adding to
the former, preaching twice and catechizing. And in our great need we kept 2
solemn fasts, and found a gracious effect. Let all that love and use fasting
and praying take notise that it is as prevaileable by sea as by land,
wheresoever it is faithfully performed. Besides the ship master and his company
used every night to set their 8 and 12 a clock watches with singing a psalm
and prayer that was not read out of a book. This I write not for boasting and
flattery; but for the benefit of those that have a mind to come to New England
hereafter, that if they look for and desire to have as prosperous a voyage as
we had, they may use the same means to attain the same. So letting pass our
passage by sea, we will now bring our discourse to land on the shore of New
England, and I shall by God's assistance endeavor to speak nothing but the
naked truth, and both acquaint you with the commodities and discommodities of
the country.

[Of the earth: Of the water: Of the air: Of the fire in New England: As also
of the discommodities of the country, and the condition of the Natives, that
may be seen at large in Mr. Higginson's printed relation of New England.]
NOW for the present condition of the plantation what it is. When we came first
to Naimkecke, now called Salem, we found about half a score houses built: and a
fair house newly built for the governor, and we found also abundance of corn
planted by them, excellent good and well liking. We brought with us about 200
passengers and planters more, which now by common consent of all the old
planters are all now combyned together into one body politic under the same
governor. There are with us in all old and new planters 300, whereof 200 are
settled at Naimkecke, now called Salem, and the rest plant themselves at
Massachusetts bay, being to build a town there called Charleston or
Charlestowne; we that are settled at Salem make what haste we can to build, so
that within a short time we shall have a fair town. We have great ordnance
whereof we doubt not but to fortifye ourselves in short time, to keep out a
potent adversarye. But that which is our greatest comfort and means of defense
above all others, is, that we have here the true religion and holy ordinances
of almighty God amongst us. Thanks be to God we have plenty of preaching and
diligent catechizing, with strict and careful exercise of good and commendable
orders to bring our people to christian conversation, which whilst we do we
doubt not but God will be with us, and so Romans 8.31. what shall we then say to
these things. If God be with us who can be against us?

Some brief collections out of a letter that Mr. Higginson sent to his friends
at Leicester.
THERE are certainly expected here the next spring the coming of 60 familyes
out of Dorcettershire, who have by letters signified so much to the Governor
to desire him to appoint them places of habitations; they bringing their
ministers with them. Also many families are expected out of Lincolnshire and a
minister with them, and a great company of godly christians out of London. Such
of you as come from Leister, I would counsel you to come quickly, and that for
two reasons. 1st, if you linger too long, the passages of Jordan through the
malice of Satan may be stopped; that you can not come if you would. 2dly,
Those that come first speed best here, and have the privilege of choosing
choice places of habitations. Little children of 5 years old may by setting
corn one month be able to get their own maintenance abundantly. Oh what a
good work might you that are rich do for your poor brethren, to help them
with your purses only to convey them hither with their children and families,
where they may live as well both for soul and body as any where in the the
world. Besides they will recompense the cost by helping to build houses and
plant your ground for a time; which shall be difficult work at the first,
except you have the help of many hands. Mr. Johnson out of Lincolnshire and
many others have helped our godly christians hither, to be employed in their
work for a while, and then to live of themselves. We have here about 40 goats
that give milk, and as many milch kyne; we have 6 or 7 mares and an horse, and
do every day expect the coming of half a score mares more, and 30 kyne by two
ships that are to follow us. They that come let them bring mares, kyne and
sheep as many as they can: Ireland is the best place to provide sheep, and
lies in the way. Bring none that are in lamb, nor mares in foale; for they are
in more danger to perish at sea. Of all trades carpenters are most needful,
therefore bring as many as you can. It were a wise course for those that are of
abilityes to join together and buy a shipp for the voyage and other
merchandise. For the governor would that any man may employ his stock in what
merchandises he please, excepting only beaver skins, which the company of
merchants reserve to themselves and the managing of the public stock. If any
be of the mind to buy a shipp, my cousin Nowells counsel would be good. Also
one Mr. -- a very godly man and the master of the ship we went in, and likewise
one Mr. Graves the master's maite, dwelling in Wapping, may herein staund you
in steed. The payment of the transportation of things is wondrous dear, as 5
l. a man, and 10 l. a horse, and commonly 3 l. for every tun of goods: So
that a little more then will pay for the passage will purchase the possession
of a ship for all together.

No man has or can have a house built for him here unless he comes himself,
or else sends servants before to do it for him. It was an error that I now
perceive both in myself, and others did conceive by not rightly understanding
the merchaunts meaning. For we thought that all that put in their money into
the common stock should have a house built for them, besides such a portion of
land; but it was not so. They shall indeed have so much land allotted to them
when they come to take possession of it and make use of it, but if they will
have houses they must build them. Indeed we that are ministers, and all the
rest that were entertained and sent over and maintained by the rest of the
company, as their servants, for such a time in such employments, all such are
to have houses built them of the companies charge and no others nor otherwise.
They that put money into the stock, as they do a good work to help forwards
so worthy a plantation, so all the gain they are like to have, is according to
the increase of the stock at 3 years end, by the trade of beaver, besides the
lands which they shall enjoy when they will.

All that come must have victuals with them for a twelve month, I mean they
must have meal, oatmeale and such like sustenaunce of food, till they can get
increase of corn by their own labor. For, otherwise, so many may come
without provision at the first, as that our small beginnings may not be
sufficient to maintain them.

Before you come be careful to be strongly instructed what things are fittest
to bring with you for your more comfortable passage at sea, as also for your
husbandrey occasions when you come to the land. For when you are once parted
with England you shall meet neither with taverns nor alehouse, nor butchers,
nor grosers, nor apothecaries shops to help what things you need, in the midst
of the great ocean, nor when you are come to land, here are yet neither markets
nor fayres to buy what you want. Therefore be sure to furnish yourselves with
things fitting to be had before you come; as meal for bread, malt for drink,
woollen and linen cloth, and leather for shoes, and all manner of carpenters

houses and furniture for ploughs and carts, and glass for windows, and many
other things which were better for you to think of them there than to want them
here.

Whilst I was writing this letter my wiffe brought me word that the fishers had

a pound.

Right Worshipful,
I Did expect to have been with you in person at the court, and to that end I
put to sea yesterday and was driven back again the wind being stiff against
us. And there being noe canoe or boat at Sagust I must have been constrained
to go to Mistick and thence about to Charles town, which at that time I durst
not be so bold, my body being at this present in an ill condition to wade or
take cold, and therefore I desire you to pardon me. Though otherwise I could
much have desired it, by reason of many occasions and businesses. There are at
Mr. Hewsons plantation 5 or 6 kine very ill and in great danger, I fear they
will hardly escape it whereof twoe are mine and all I have which are worse
than any of the rest. I left mine there this winter to do Mr. Skeleton a
pleasure to keep his for him here at Salem that he might have the benefit of
their milk. And I understand by Wincoll that they have been ill tended and he
says almost starved. Besides they have fed on acornes and they cannot digest
them for that they vomitt exceedingly and are so bound in their bodies that he
is feign to rake them and to use all his skill to maintain life in them. I
have willed him to be there till he can bring them to some strength again if
it be possible. And I have given him malt to make them mashes of licoris and
annis seeds and long pepper and such other things as I had to drench them. I
could wish when Manning has recovered his strength that you would free him,
for he will never do you or Mr. Hewson service, for when he was well he was as
negligent as the worst of them. Mr. Skeleton, myself and the rest of the
congregation desire to be thankful to God and yourselfe for your benevolence
to Mr. Haughtons child. The Lord restore it you. I prevailed with much ado
with Sir Richard for an old debt here, which he thought was desperate, to
contribute it, which, I hope I shall make good for the child. I think Mr.
Skeleton has written, to you, whom he thinks stand most in need of
contribution of such provisions as you will be pleased to give amongst us of
that which was sent over. The yeele potts you sent for are made, which I had in
my boat, hoping to have brought them with me. I caused him to make but two
for the present, if you like them and his prices (for he works for himself)
you shall have as many as you desire. He sells them for 4 shillings a piece.
Sir, I desired the rather to have been at court because I hear I am much
complained on by goodman Dexter, for strikeing him. I acknowledge I was too
rash in strikeing him, understanding since that it is not lawful for a justice
of peace to strike. But if you had seen the manner of his carriadge with such
daring of me with his arms on kembow, etc. It would have provoked a very
patient man. But I will write noe more of it but leave it till we speak before
you face to face. Only thus far further that he has given out if I had a
purse he would make me empty it, and if he cannot have justice here he will
do wonders in England, and if he cannot prevale there he will try it out
with me here at blows. Sir, I desire that you will take all into
consideration. If it were lawful to try it at blows and he a fit man for
me to deal with, you should not hear me complain, but I hope the Lord has
brought me off from that course. I thought good further to write what my
judgment is for the dismissing of the court till corn be set. It will hinder
us that are far off exceedingly, and not further you there. Men's labor are
precious here in corn setting time, the plantations being yet so weak. I will
be with you, the Lord assisting me, as soon as conveniently I can. In the
mean while I committ you to his protection and safeguard that never fails his
children, and rest

Your unfeigned loving friend to command. Jo: Endecott.

Bradford, Governor of Plymouth, also the Copy of an Order of his Majesty's
Council.
SIR,
UPON a petition exhibited by Sir Christopher Gardener, Sir Ferdinando Gorges,
Capt. Mason, etc. against you and us, the cause was heard before the Lords of
the Privy Council, and afterward reported to the King; the success whereof
makes it evident, to all, that the Lord has care of his people here: the
passages are admirable and too long to write. I heartily wish for an
opportunity to impart them to you, being many sheets of paper; but the
conclusion was against all men's expectation, an order for our encouragement,
and much blame and disgrace upon the adversaries, which calls for much
thankfulness from us, all which we purpose (God willing) to express in a day of
thanksgiving to our merciful God (I doubt not but you will consider if it be
not fit for you to join in it) who as he has humbled us by his late
correction, so he has lifted us up, by an abundant rejoicing in our
deliverance out of so desperate a danger; so as that which our enemies built
their hopes upon, to ruin us by, he has mercifully disposed to our great
advantage, as I shall further acquaint you when occasion shall serve.

The Copy of the Order follows.

Seal Earl of Dorset Lord Viscount Faulkland Lord Bishop of London Lord
Cottington Mr. Trevers Mr. Vice Chamberlain Mr. Secretary Cook Mr. Secretary
Windebank


WHEREAS his Majesty has lately been informed of great distraction and much
disorder in the plantations in the parts of America called New England, which
if they be true, and suffered to run on, would tend to the dishonor of this
kingdom, and utter ruin of the plantation: for prevention whereof, and for the
orderly settling of government, according to the intentions of those patents
which have been granted by his Majesty and from his late royal father king
James, it has pleased his Majesty that the Lords and others of his most
honorable Privy Council should take the same into consideration. Their
Lordships in the first place thought fit to make a committee of this Board to
take examinations of the matters informed. Which committee having called diverse
of the principal adventurers in that plantation, and heard those that are
complainants against them, most of the things informed being denied, and
resting to be proved, by parties that must be called from that place, which
required a long expense of time, and at present their Lordships finding, they
were upon dispatch of men, victuals and merchandise for that place, all which
would be at a stand if the adventurer should have discouragement, or take
suspicion, that the state here had no good opinion of that plantation; their
Lordships not laying the fault or fancies (if any be) of some particular men,
upon the general government or principal adventurers, which in due time is
further to be enquired into, have thought fit in the mean time to declare,
that the appearances were so fair and hopes so great, that the country would
prove both beneficial to this kingdom, and profitable to the particulars, as
that the adventurers had cause to go on cheerfully with their undertakings, and
rest assured, if things were carried as was pretended when the patents were
granted, and accordingly as by the patent is appointed, his Majesty would not
only maintain the liberties and privileges heretofore granted, but supply any
thing further that might tend to the good government, prosperity and comfort of
his people there of that place, etc.

Mr. Cotton's Letter, giving the Reasons of his and Mr. Hooker's Removal to
New England.
Reverend and beloved brother in our blessed Savior,
THAT which you observe touching the wonderful goodness of the Lord to my
wife, and child, in the midst of deep dangers, I desire never to forgett it,
but to walk (as the Lord shall be pleased to help me) according to that
abundant faithfulness of his to one so undeserving all my days. Help me
with your faithful prayers so to do: That as by the prayers of yourselfe,
and other brethren, I acknowledge the former mercy to have been granted me,
so by the same, a faithful and fruitful use of it may be granted likewise;
otherwise I may say it with shame, I see a frame of spirit in my self ready to
turn every grace of God into unprofitablenesse, yea and forgettfullnesse of
the most high God, the God of my salvation: Howsoever God dealt otherwise with
my cosigne Suckey, and which might give unto some whom it nearly concerned a
seasonable advertisement, yet I am persuaded it was in much faithfulness to
her, that God took her away to prevent the disquietnesse and discouragement of
her spirit, which the evils ensueinge, evils hasteninge upon the town, would
have brought upon her: The Lord is wise and gracious, and knows how to
deliver his, out of the hour of temptation; blessed for ever be his name in
Christ.

The questions you demand, I had rather answer by word of mouth, than by
letter, yet I will not refuse to give you account of my brother Hookers
removal and mine own, saying you require a reason thereof from us both. We
both of us concur in a 3 fold ground of removal. 1. God havinge shut a door
against both of us from ministringe to him and his people in our wonted
congregations, and calling us by a remnant of our people, and by others of this
country to minister to them here, and opening a door to us this way, who are
we that we should strive against God and refuse to follow the concurrence of
his ordinance and providence together, calling us forth to minister here. If
we may and ought to follow Gods calling 3 hundred miles, why not 3 thousand?
2. Our Saviors warrant is in our case, that when we are distressed in our
course in one country (nequid dicam gravius) we should flee to another. To
choose rather to bear witness to the truth by imprisonment than by banishment,
is indeed sometimes Gods way, but not in case men have ability of body and
opportunity to remove, and no necessary engagement for to stay. Whilst Peter
was young he might gird himself and go wither he would, Joh. 21.8. but when
he was old and unfitt for traveyle, then indeed God called him rather to suffer
himself to be girt of others, and led along to prison, and to death.
Nevertheles in this point I conferred with the chief of our people, and offered
them to bear witness to the truth I had preached, and practiced amongst them
even unto bonds, if they conceived it might be any confirmation to their faith
and patience; but they diswaded me that course, as thinking it better for
themselves, and for me, and for the church of God, to withdraw my self from
the present storm, and to minister in this country to such of their town as
they had sent before hither, and such others as were willinge to go alonge
with me, or to follow after me; the most of the (...) choosing rather to dwell
in the [obliterated] there. What service my self, and brother Hooker might do
to our people or other brethren in prison (especially in close prison which
was feared) I suppose we both of us (by Gods help) do the same, and much
more, and with more freedom from hence, as occasion is offered: Besides all our
other service to the people here, which yett is enough, and more than enough to
fill both our hands, yea and the hands of many brethren more, such as your
self, should God be pleased to make way for your comfortable passage to us. To
have tarryed in England for the end you mention, to appear in defense of that
cause for which we were questioned, had been (as we conceyve it in our case) to
limitt witnesse-bearing to the cause (which may be done more ways than one) to
one only way, and that such a way as we do not see God calling us unto. Did
not Paul bear witness against the Levitical ceremonies, and yett choose
rather to depart quickly out of Jerusalem, because the most of the Jews would
not receyve his testimony concerning Christ in that question (Acts 22.18.)
than to stay at Jerusalem to bear witness to that cause unto prison and
death? Not that we came hither to strive against ceremonies (or to fight
against shadows) there is noe need of our further labor in that course; our
people here desire to worship God in spirit and in truth, and our people left
in England know as well the grounds and reasons of our suffering against these
things, as our sufferings themselves, which we beseech the Lord to accept and
bless, in our blessed Savior. How far our testimony there has prevayled
with any others, to search more seriouslye into the cause, we do rather
observe in thankfulness and silence, than speak of to the prejudice of our
brethren.

3. It has been noe small inducement to us, to choose rather to remove hither,
than to stay there, that we might enjoy the liberty, not of some ordinances of
God, but of all, and all in purity. For though we bless the Lord with you for
the gracious means of salvation, which many of your congregations do enjoy
(whereof our own souls have found the blessinge, and which we desire may be
for ever continued, and enlarged to you) yet seeing Christ has instituted no
ordinance in vain (but all to the offerringe of the body of Christ) and we
know that our souls stand in need of all to the uttmost, we durst not so
far be wanting to the grace of Christ, and to the necessity of our own
souls, as to sit down some where else, under the shadow of some ordinances,
when by two months travayle we might come to enjoy the liberty of all.

To your 2d question, how far ministers are bound to bear witness against
corruptions cast upon the face of Gods ordinances, it is too large a point for
me to give answer to in the heel of a letter. But thus much briefly, wittnes
is to be borne against corruptions. 1. By keeping a man's own garments clean;
I mean his own outward practice. Rev. 16.15. 2. By declaringe the whole
counsel of God to his people, not shunninge any part of it, as reasonable
occasion is offered, to prevent sin in them. Acts 20.26.27. 3. By avoiding
appearances of evil, as well as evil it self. 1 Thessalonians. 5.22. Eleazerus durst
not eat mutton, or bread, or any other clean food, when it had an appearance
of eateing swines flesh, but chose death rather than deliverance by such
means. 2 Maccab. cap. 6. ver. 21. to 25. whose story though it be
apochryphall, yet the example authentical, as being ratifyed by the apostles
testimony amongst the rest of like nature. Heb. 11.35. where by the others he
speaks of he means not other women, but other men, for the word is (...)
masculine. Howsoever, Peter's dissemblinge is evidently blamed by Paul in a like
case, when by his example he countenanced the imposinge of ceremonies upon the
Gentiles, to whom God never gave them. Gal. 2.11. to 14.4. By contendinge for
the truth in an holy manner, when others contend with us against it. Jude 3.4.
By givinge account of our faith before magistrates, if they call us to it
publicly, requireing to be informed of our doctrine and manner of life. 1
Pet. 3.15. Otherwise, if they call us to know our opinions in private
(intending to bring us into trouble) or publicly, rather as captions
questionists than judicial governors, in such a case, I suppose we may
conceal our minds, and put our adversaryes upon proof, as our Savior did,
John 18.19, 20, 21. But why do I spend time and words to you in these
things, who know them as well as I can tell you, I rather desire you may be
kept in a peaeable way of bearinge witness to the truth (if the will of God
be such) than exposed to hazards by such confessions as might prejudice your
liberty. My poor requests are to heaven for you, as I desire you might not
forgett me and mine, and all us here. Now the God of peace and power guide and
support your spirit, in all your holy endeavors, bless and prosper your
labors, and keep you as a chosen vessel in the shadow of his hand, through
him that has loved us.

Present my humble service to my right honorable lord; as also my dear
affectyon to Mr. Ball, Mr. Slater, and all the brethren with you, especially to
Mr. Dod, Mr. Cleaver. Mr. Winston, Mr. Cotton, with earnest desire of the
continuance of all their prayers (with your own) in our behalf. So I rest

Your very loving brother in our blessed Savior, J. C.

I Have received yours dated the 10th December 1635, being very glad to hear of
your welfare, it does somewhat rejoice my heart when I consider and think
what you enjoyne: my heart is with you, I shall I hope be glad if the Lord
make me a way which I hope he will that I may come, see your glory and
behold the bewttye of our God in those gowenings of his in his tempel: Sir it
did glad me to see that you had not forgott me and more that you would be
pleased to take the pains to wryt to me. Sir I have now put of my trade and
as soon as it shall please God to send in my debts, that I may pay what I owe
and clear things so here that I may come away without giving offense I am for
your part, the Lord make me a clear way: now Sir seeing you have me in
your thoughts help forward that Mr. Ransford may be accommodated with lands for
a farm to keep my cattele that so my stock may be preserved, for I conceive
I have lost near L.500 as Mr. Willson can certifye you: thus not doubting of
your love he rests

Loving Cosen,
I Return you many thanks for your great love and hearty intertaynment of my
brother, the ten pounds you desired me to pay for his board I paid to your
brother Downing, and think it little enough if not to little as things are with
you for the present, and must acknowledge my self your debtor for your care
and pains with him, the account you sent I have perused and cast it up
together with my disbursement and those of Sir Richard Saltonstalls which I
have added to mine having repaid him what he laid out for stones L 10 and
brasss, and fraught of the stones with some other small things as when I send
you the account will appear, so that if I be not mistaken the account will be
somewhat over, but for the present I conceive a mistake in the casting up of
your account which because I could not tell how to rectify I resolved by Mr.
Downings advise to send you back your own copy and to keep an other my
self, which his man has written out for me so that when you see your own
hand you may be the better able to set it right. I have sent over some fruit
trees and some grape cuttings the best I could get, if you like any of the
grapes you may take what you please of them, I pray advise what I were do with
my trees, I shall be larger next time, remember me kindly to my cosen your
wife, so with my hourly prayers I rest your ever loving cosen,

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Winslow to Governor Winthrop of the
Massachusetts.
BEing newly risen from court I was requested by our governor, who cannot at
present write, to dispatch a messenger to you just to inform you that we have
this day by solemn act of court engaged ourselves to take part with you and
our brethren of Conectacut in the war against the Pecoats, purposing to send
fourth thirty men for the land service besides the managing of the vessels
which we provide will not be less than forty; now we fear it will be longer
than we willingly would for want of boats or vessels which are very scarce with
us, unless you can furnish us for which we would willingly pay, as also some
other necessaries hereunto belonging, tomorrow we shall know who are the men to
go with them, but hereof our governor will write at large (who desires to
salute you once more by my pen) so soon as our court is ended and opportunity
is offered. Another maine end of our sending is in regard we have heard no more
till since we rose this evening of the last expedition of our brethren of
Conectacut and Capt. Underhill, and that is by Capt. Standish his Indian who
was sent this morning to Namasket and says the defeat of the fort is true and
that only three English were slain in the taking of it. As also that the
foresaid English and Capt. Patrick Massachusetts History Vol. I. p. 76.
are still at Narraganset and have been some days which makes us jealous and
shall be till we hear from you, and the rather because ouy heard nothing from
any of them by letter when John Jenny came away. I pray you therefore let us
hear, and let not this (though true) discourage the sending of your 160 men,
but take such revenge as may be a service to after times for any the barbarians
to rise against us. If any letters be come from England I pray you to send them
by the bearer, or such news as is worth the sending. I am sorry for the
carriages of your people, God sanctify his hand and fit us for such trials as
he has appointed. Thus with my love to you and prayers for you and yours
desiring you to salute my christian friends with you take leave remaining yours
till death,

Copy of a Letter from Capt. Israel Stoughton to the Governor of the
Massachusetts.
Honorable Sir,
IT has pleased God further to crown our poor endeavors with success
graciously as you shall largely and punctually understand by Capt. Patrick, to
whom I leave the relation wholly, seeing a lively voice will do it: and
therefore I entreat your favor for this omission; specially because it is late
in the night and a fair wind attends us. Surely there have been so many
singular providence as are worthy of due observance and eternal praise. And
allbeit we have not the whole of our desires, yet O that we could extol him
for what we have and wait for more. Much is done, but not all, and if ought be
well done I desire we may not be weary thereof but proceed as God shall
minister new occasions. Capt. Patrick can inform you of our intentions for the
future: both for Block Island, Long Island, Indians beyond Puillipioak, etc.
Also if it shall appear useful, and pleasing to you we will some of us come
march through Neepenet: I earnestly desire the work may be thoroughly done,
and see we and our friends will suffer much by scattered wretches, if they be
not closely followed. But I shall write more fully suddenly, and do desire to
understand your pleasures: For we will prefer your minds before ours: But it is
clear some must reside here or hereabouts. It is beyond my abilities for the
present to resolve you which is best in all things, or particularly about
planting Pecot. For though the place be subsistable, and an excellent harbor,
and abundance of corn, and the same ground ready for English grain forthwith,
which is a great help to planters, yet the providence of God guided us to so
excellent a country at Quaillipioak New Haven.
river and so all along the coast as we traveled, as I am confident we have
not the like in English possession as yet, and probable it is the Dutch will
seize it if the English do not. It is conceived generally far more worthy than
Pequid notwithstanding the former considerations. It is too good for any but
friends, Capt. Patrick can inform you the full. I heartily thank you for your
loving care of us about necessaries and do acknowledge your kind acceptance of
our poor imperfect endeavors, craving your prayers for more grace that we may
so increase in loyal faithfullness and fruitfullness, such as may be God's
honor and the fullfilling of your and our joy through Jesus Christ our Lord,
and so, with my due respect to your self with the council and majestrates I
take leave,

Yours as in duty I am bound, Israel Stoughton.

Liberty and the Weal Public reconciled: In a brief and clear declaration
of the misapprehension of some grieved minds concerning the lawful and
orderly proceedings of the late Court of Elections at Newtown, the 17th of the
3d month, 1637. Massachusetts History Vol. I p. 61.

The complaint is, that the peoples liberty was restrained, by such as
withstood the reading of a petition tendered before the elections made.

FOR clearing hereof it is to be considered, 1. What the liberty is which they
desire to have preserved: That I take to be this, viz. That the people may not
be subjected to any law or power among themselves without their consent;
whatsoever is more than this, is neither lawful nor durable, and instead of
liberty may prove bondage or licentiousness.

2. If this liberty be at any time restrained by the people themselves, they
are guilty of their own harm; if any be.

3. If such restraint be not redressed, upon any seasonable opportunity, when
lawfully it may, they can blame none so much as themselves.

4. That the power of a popular state being unlimited in its own nature, and
being by free consent and wise advise, brought into a method; and so bounded,
in order only, not in power, it is more safe to be so continued and exercised
(though with offense or perhaps damage to some particulars in some transient
cases, the original power remaining still inviolate) than to be putt out of its
settled course, upon every pretense, or occasion, of public grievance: seeing
every deviation in the very form of any such government is allways attended
with much trouble, and some danger.

Answ. If we examine the passages of the court, we shall see where the error
was.

It is observable that the proper business of this court was matter of
election, and it is also obviouse, that it has obtained, by custom, the first
place in that day (except admission of freemen) and where it was objected, that
in the court 1635, the petition in Mr. Endecotts case, was heard and answered
before election: It is not true: For I can show by that which has been
faithfully kept of the passages of that court, among other, that all petitions
were rejected till the elections were passed; and many can remember, that when
that case was heard, Mr. Heynes sat governor, who had been elected that court.

It is objected again, that the court might yet have heard the petition first,
and seeing it was for the peoples liberty, why was it stopped? To this it may
be answered, that it is true, they might, if they had so pleased: But first
they would not, and their refusal was lawful upon these reasons.

1. It had been no point of wisdom to break order, without pressing necessity,
or for some prevalent advantage, neither of which could the court then
apprehend.

2. When the question was, whether petition or election should be first, 1 one
could give answer there, but the court it self, which was the whole body of
freemen (for none of the magistrates had any more influence in that court than
any other freeman) so as here was no other way to know the mind of the court
but by putting it to vote, and by numbering either side, to decide the
question; this was done, and the major part being for election, it may truly
be said, that the people or the court did order that election should proceed
before the petition should be heard: And now let any wise man judge, who has
done the people wrong, or what restraint has been putt upon their liberty.
For if the people would have had the petition first heard, who could have
judged it, or what exposition did any make against it, otherwise than is
lawful for any freeman to do, by showing his dislike and giving reason for it?

If it be objected, that a great part of the people did not consent: I answer,
there was not one freeman there but his consent was to it: for it is an
insepparable incident to all bodies politic, which are composed of voluntary
members, that every one (in his admission) gives an implicit consent to
whatsoever the mayor part shall establishe, not being against religion or the
weal public, and this they are further bound unto by their oathe: yea if the
oath be disputable, yet their consent is in it, till it be cleared, and the
error of the mayor part convinced by plain arguments: otherwise no such
societye would long subsist: neither could peace be at all preserved in it; for
it is hardly possible, to establishe any thing (except of indifferent nature)
that shall please every man: and if one or more in any society may be at
liberty, when the rest are restrained, it can neither be equal nor safe.

3. It had been mere injustice, for the people then assembled to have
concluded any public business by popular vote. The reason is apparent.
Because those towns, which by lawful order, upon public considerations, sent
their proxies for elections, and their deputyes for other affairs, had been
injuriously surprised, and deprived of their due interest to discern of those
things, which did no less concern them than the rest who were present. And
upon this ground, whatsoever the freemen then present had concluded had been
merely void and no man bound to submit to it: for, besides the manifest
iniurye to such as had been so unduly kept away, it might have fallen out,
that, being present, they might have given such reasons as might have altered
the judgment of the rest of the court.

4. If the petition had contained any matter of grievance which had necessarily
required the help of the people to redress it (as in some cases it may fall
out) yet why this might not as well have been done after the election as before
does not appear: for the people must have stayed as long time, for dispatch of
both, whichsoever had first been handled, petitions or elections: And if they
had unadvisedly elected any unworthy person, they might soon have removed him:
and the just disgrace upon such an one had more than recompensed the short time
it would have required.

5. So the general court at Boston, in the 3. mo. 1634, when the people
established a reformation of such things as they judged to be amiss in the
government, they then settled an order, that in the court of elections they
should leeve their deputyes to manage all other affairs.

6. It is very difficult and dangerous for so great a people and of so
different apprehensions, to give judgment in a cause of right or wrong, being
suddenly discovered to them: and if we should grow to such a multitude as
(through Gods blessing) we may soon be, it will be impossible it should be
well carried.

7. It is easy to judge, that 30 or 40 distinct men, chosen out of all the
country, and by all reason as free from partialitye or prejudice as any other,
may give a more just sentence in any such cause (upon deliberation and quiet
discourse) than a whole multitude upon the sudden, when many may be thought
not to hear what is proposed, and others not to understand it, and perchance
the greater part in a heat and tumult, and when the weakest and worst member
of the commonwealth adds as much weight to the sentence as the most godly and
judicious.

8. The people (in the said court 1634) having (by searious advice of such as
they best knew, and that seemed to be much lovers of their liberty) given
power to their deputyes, for future time, to do whatsoever themselves might
(save in matters of elections) order requires they should first refer the
redress of their grievances to their deputyes, and the people not to
entermeddle, except the deputyes should first fail, and that apparently and
previously: which is seldom like to fall out in a popular state, where nothing
but force can deprive them of their liberty, except they shall wittinglye and
willinglye give them away, and then volunti non fit injuria, a man cannot blame
another for the harm he does to himself.

A Declaration of the Intent and Equitye of the Order made at the last Court,
to this effect, that none should be received to inhabit within this
Jurisdiction but such as should be allowed by some of the Magistrates. The
Defense and the Replication are undoubtedly the Performances of Mr. Winthrop.
The Answer is by Mr. Vane, afterward Sir H* Vane. I leave the Reader to judge
who had the best cause and who best defended it. See Mass. Hist. Vol. I. p. 62.


FOR clearing of such scruples as have arisen about this order, it is to be
considered, first, what is the essential form of a common weal or body
politic such as this is, which I conceive to be this -- The consent of a
certain company of people, to cohabite together, under one government for
their mutual safety and welfare.

In this description all these things do concur to the well being of such a
body, 1 Persons, 2 Place, 3 Consent, 4 Government or Order, 5 Welfare.

It is clearly agreed, by all, that the care of safety and welfare was the
original cause or occasion of commonweals and of many familyes subjecting
themselves to rulers and laws; for no man has lawful power over another, but
by birth or consent, so likewise, by the law of proprietye, no man can have
just interest in that which belongs to another, without his consent.

From the premises will arise these conclusions.

1. No common weal can be founded but by free consent.

2. The persons so incorporating have a public and relative interest each in
other, and in the place of their cohabitation and goods, and laws, etc. and in
all the means of their welfare so as none other can claim privilege with
them but by free consent.

3. The nature of such an incorporation ties every member thereof to seek out
and entertain all means that may conduce to the welfare of the body, and to
keep off whatsoever does appear to tend to their damage.

4. The welfare of the whole is to be put to apparent hazard for the advantage
of any particular members.

From these conclusions I thus reason.

1. If we here be a corporation established by free consent, if the place of
our cohabitation be our own, then no man has right to come into us etc.
without our consent.

2. If no man has right to our lands, our government privileges, etc. but by
our consent, then it is reason we should take notice of before we confer any
such upon them.

3. If we are bound to keep off whatsoever appears to tend to our ruin or
damage, then may we lawfully refuse to receive such whose dispositions suite
not with ours and whose society (we know) will be hurtful to us, and therefore
it is lawful to take knowledge of all men before we receive them.

4. The churches take liberty (as lawfully they may) to receive or reject at
their discretion; yea particular towns make orders to the like effect; why then
should the common weal be denied the like liberty and the whole more
restrained than any part?

5. If it be sin in us to deny some men place etc. among us, then it is
because of some right they have to this place etc. for to deny a man that which
he has no right unto is neither sin nor injury.

6. If strangers have right to our houses or lands, etc. then it is either of
justice or of mercy; if of justice let them plead it, and we shall know what
to answer: but if it be only in way of mercy, or by the rule of hospitality,
etc. then I answer 1st, A man is not a fit object of mercy except he be in
miserye. 2d, We are not bound to exercise mercy to others to the ruin of
ourselves. 3d, There are few that stand in need of mercy at their first
coming hither. As for hospitality, that rule does not bind further than for
some present occasion, not for continual residence.

7. A family is a little common wealth, and a common wealth is a great family.
Now as a family is not bound to entertain all comers, no not every good man
(otherwise than by way of hospitality) no more is a common wealth.

8. It is a general received rule, turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur
hospes, it is worse to receive a man whom we must cast out again, than to
deny him admittance.

9. The rule of the Apostle, John 2.10. is, that such as come and bring not the
true doctrine with them should not be received to house, and by the same reason
not into the common weal.

10. Seeing it must be granted that there may come such persons (suppose
Jesuits, etc.) which by consent of all ought to be rejected, it will follow
that this law (being only for notice to be taken of all that come to us,
without which we cannot avoid such as indeed are to be kept out) is no other
but just and needful, and if any should be rejected that ought to be received,
that is not to be imputed to the law, but to those who are betrusted with the
execution of it. And herein is to be considered, what the intent of the law is,
and by consequence, by what rule they are to walk, who are betrusted with the
keeping of it. The intent of the law is to preserve the welfare of the body;
and for this end to have none received into any fellowship with it who are
likely to disturb the same, and this intent (I am sure) is lawful and good.
Now then, if such to whom the keeping of this law is committed, be persuaded in
their judgments that such a man is likely to disturb and hinder the public
weal, but some others who are not in the same trust, judge otherwise, yet they
are to follow their own judgments, rather then the judgments of others who
are not alike interested: As in trial of an offender by a jury; the twelve men
are satisfied in their consciences, upon the evidence given, that the party
deserves death: but there are 20 or 40 standers by, who conceive otherwise, yet
is the jury bound to condemn him according to their own consciences, and not
to acquit him upon the different opinion of other men, except their reasons
can convince them of the error of their consciences, and this is according to
the rule of the Apostle, Romans 14.5. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
mind.

If it be objected, that some profane persons are received and others who are
religious are rejected, I answer 1st, It is not known that any such thing
has as yet fallen out. 2, Such a practice may be justifiable as the case may
be, for younger persons (even profane ones) may be of less danger to the
common weal (and to the churches also) than some older persons, though
professors of religion: for our Savior Christ when he conversed with
publicans, etc. says that such were nearer the kingdom of heaven than the
religious pharisees, and one that is of large parts and confirmed in some
erroneous way, is likely to do more harm to church and common weal, and is
of less hope to be reclaymed, then 10 profane persons, who have not yet been
hardened, in the contempt of the means of grace.

Lastly, Whereas it is objected that by this law, we reject good christians and
so consequently Christ himself: I answer 1st, It is not known that any
christian man has been rejected. 2, A man that is a true christian, may be
denied residence among us, in some cases, without rejecting Christ, as admit a
true christian should come over, and should maintain community of goods, or
that magistrates ought not to punish the breakers of the first table, or the
members of churches for criminal offenses: or that no man were bound to be
subject to those laws or magistrates to which they should not give an
explicit consent, etc. I hope no man will say, that not to receive such an
one, were to reject Christ; for such opinions (though being maintained in
simple ignorance, they might stand with a state of grace yet) they may be so
dangerous to the public weal in many respects, as it would be our sin and
unfaithfullness to receive such among us, except it were for trial of their
reformation, I would demand then in the case in question (for it is bootelesse
curiosity to refrain openesse in things public) whereas it is said that this
law was made of purpose to keep away such as are of Mr Wheelwright his
judgment (admit it were so which yet I cannot confess) where is the evil of
it? If we conceive and find by sadd experience that his opinions are such, as
by his own profession cannot stand with external peace, may we not provide for
our peace, by keeping of such as would strengthen him, and infect others with
such dangerous tenets? and if we find his opinions such as will cause
divisions, and make people look at their magistrates, ministers and brethren
as enemies to Christ and Antichrists, etc. were it not sin and
unfaithfullness in us, to receive more of those opinions, which we already
find the evil fruit of: Nay, why do not those who now complain join with
us in keeping out of such, as well as formerly they did in expelling Mr.
Williams for the like, though less dangerous? Where this change of their
judgments should arise I leave to themselves to examine, and I earnestly
entreat them so to do, and for this law let the equally minded judge, what
evil they find in it, or in the practice of those who are betrusted with the
execution of it.

A brief Answer to a certain declaration, made of the intent and equitye of
the order of court, that none should be received to inhabit within this
jurisdiction but such as should be allowed by some of the magistrates.
THE scope of the declaration is to defend and justifye, the order in question,
to which purpose these four (...) laid down.

1. A ground work to upholde such reasons as are produced in the cause. 2. The
reasons themselves, whereby the order is defended. 3. Objections are made and
answered as would seem. 4. The conclusion of the whole discourse.
For the ground work which is laid in the first place; it consists partly of
a description of a common wealth, which in some sort is explycated, and partly
of diverse conclusions ariseing from such description and explication.

The description which is set down in effect is this. A commonwealth is a
certain company of people consenting to cohabit together under one
government, for their mutual safetye and welfare. In which description this
maine fault is found. At the best it is but a description of a commonwealth
at large, and not of such a commonwealth as this (as is said) which is not
only christian but dependant upon the grante also of our Souveraigne; for so
are the express words of that order of court to which the whole country was
required to subscribe.

Now if you will define a christian commonwealth, there must be put in; such a
consent as is according to God; Prove 8.5. Isai. 6.7.
a subjecting to such a government as is according unto Christ. And if you will
define a corporation, incorporated by virtue of the grante of our Souveraigne,
it must be such a consent as the grante requires and permitts and in that
manner and form as it prescribes, or else it will be defective. The
commonwealth here described, may be a company of Turkish pirates as well as
Christian professors, unless the consent and government be better limited
than it is in this definition; for sure it is, all Pagans and Infidels, even
the Indians here amongst us, may come within this compass. And is this such a
body politic as ours, as you say? God forbid. Our commonwealth we fear
would be twice miserable, if Christ and the King should be shut out so. Reasons
taken from the nature of a commonwealth, not founded upon Christ, nor by his
Majestyes charters, must needs fall to the ground, and fail those that rely
upon them. In the application of the description, and the conclusions inferred,
all things are not current, all things do not agree concerning the causes of
commonwealths as is affirmed. There are 7 several opinions of this matter,
which writers speak of, though this be not so material. Members of a
commonwealth may not seek out all means that may conduce to the welfare of
the body, but all lawful and due means, according to the charter they hold by,
either from God or the King, or from both: Nor may they keep out whatsoever
does appear to tend to their damage (for many things appear which are not)
but such, as upon right and evident grounds, do so appear, and are so in
truth. Thus far concerning that which has been touched may for the present
suffice.

The second thing is the reasons, which we shall set down and answer.

The first reason of the equity of the order is this, If we be a corporation
established by free consent, if the place of our habitation be our own, then
no man has right to come unto us without our consent.

Ans. We do not know how we that stand a corporation, by virtue of the Kings
charter, can thus argue; yet to avoid dispute, suppose the antecedent should be
granted, the consequence does not follow. This is all that can be inferred,
that our consent regulated by the word, and suitable to our patent ought to be
required, not this vast and illimitted consent here spoken off, our consent is
not our own, when rightly limited, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. An unlawful dissent can
hinder no man, though a lawful may.

The 2d reason runs thus, If no man has right to our lands, our government
privilegdes, etc. but by our consent, then it is reason we should take notice
of men before we confer any such upon them

Answ. Besides the doubtfulness of the truth of the supposition, the question
here is changed; for so most states do in taking the names of such as come to
dwell among them, but the question is whether the admitting or rejecting of
persons should depend upon such unlimitted and unsafe a rule, as the will and
descretion of men, suppose magistrates or others not regulated.

The 3d reason is thus framed, If we are bound to keep off whatsoever appears
to tend to our ruin and damage, then may we lawfully refuse to receive such
whose dispositions suite not with ours, and whose societye we know will be
hurtefull unto us, and therefore it is lawful to take knowledge of men before we
do receive them.

Answ. This kind of reasoning is very confused and fallacious, for the
question here is not only changed, but there is this further deceit of
wrapping up many questions in one, and besides if it were put into a right
form, the assumption would be false.

The question is not, as was said before, whether knowledge may not be taken of
men, before they be received, nor whether magistrates may refuse such as suite
not with their dispositions, or such whose societye they know will be hurteful
to them; though the second of these is not, nor cannot be proved; but whether
persons may be rejected, or admitted, upon the illimitted consent or dissent of
magistrates. The assumption also would be false, for men are not to keep off
whatsoever appears to tend to their ruin, but what really does so; Eliah
appeared to Ahab, and, no doubt, to his counsel of state, a troubler of the
commonwealth, one that brought 3 years famine, enough to ruin the whole
state: Yet the Jewish magistrates ought not to have rejected him and all those
of his frame and judgment, because thus it appeared; for in truth Elijah was
the horsemen of Israel and the chariots thereof. It appeared also to the chief
priests and pharisees, that if our blessed Savior were let alone, it would
tend to their ruin, John 11.47, 48. and therefore used means to keep it off
by rejecting Christ and his gospel, and yet we hope you will not say they were
bound to do so. Lastly, it appears to the Natives here (who by your
definition are complete commonwealths among themselves) that the cohabitation
of the English with them tends to their utter ruin, yet we believe you will
not say they may lawfully keep us out upon that ground, for our cohabitation
with them may tend to their conversion and so to their eternal salvation, and
then they should do most desperately and sinnefully. Let us then do unto our
brethren at least as we would desire to be done unto by Barbarians, which is
not to be rejected, because we suite not with the disposition of their Sechem,
nor because, by our coming, God takes them away and troubles them, and so, to
their appearance, we ruin them.

The 4th argument stands thus, The churches take liberty (as lawfully they
may) to receive or rejecte at their discretion; yea particular towns make
orders to such effect, why then should the commonwealth be denied the like
liberty, and the whole more restrained than any part?

Answ. Though the question be here concluded, yet it is far from being
soundly proved, yea, in truth, we much wonder that any member of a church
should be ignorant of the falseness of the ground work upon which this
conclusion is built; for should churches have this power, as you say they have,
to receive or rejecte at their discretion, they would quickly grow corrupt
enough. Churches have no liberty to receive or rejecte, at their discretions,
but at the discretion of Christ, whatsoever is done in word or deed, in church
or commonwealth, must be done in the name of the Lord Jesus. (Coll. 3.17.)
Neither has church nor commonwealth any other than ministerial power from
Christ (Ephesians. 5.23.) who is the head of the church, and the prince of the kings
of the earth. (Rev. 1.5.) After that Cornelius and his company had received
the holy ghost, whereby the right which they had to the covenant was evidenced,
it is not now left to the discretion of the church whether they would admit
them thereunto or not. But can any man forbid them water faith Peter, he
commanded them to be baptized. (Acts 10.47, 48.) There is the like reason of
admission into churches, when Christ opens a door to any there is none may take
liberty to shut them out. In one word, there is no liberty to be taken
neither in church nor commonwealth but that which Christ gives and is according
unto him, Gal. 5.1.

The 5th reason produced is, If it be sin in us, to deny some men place
amongst us, then it is because they have some right to our place.

Answ. The question is here again changed, for it is not whether some may be
denied, but whether any or all such as the magistrates illimitted dissent shall
rejecte. But besides this, we say, that the kings christian subjects have right
by his majesty's pattent, to come over and plant in places not inhabited, for
a double end, 1st, to enlarge his majesty's dominions, 2dly, for the conversion
of the Pagans. And since his majesty has given them right for these ends, we
may not deny them, unless they forfeite it, either by denyeing the land which
they inhabit to be an enlargement of his majesty's dominions, or becoming such
dissolute and profane persons as rather do harden the Indians than be a
means of their conversion, for by so doing we shall exceed the limitts of his
majesty's grante, and forfeite the privileges, government and lands which we
challenge to be our own.

Moreover, we may not deny residence, to any of his majesty's subjects without
just grounds, except we will do injury both to the king and his subjects, who
have adventured both their estates and lives to enjoye those privileges and
libertyes, which he has granted them. Besides the law does not only prohibit
those whom the magistrates shall dislike to plant in those places uninhabited,
though in an orderly manner, but to make their abode in friends houses, either
given or sold, or hired, which are lawful means of obtaineing right. Now if
the kings majesty give me right, if title be procured by donation, purchase,
farmeing, etc. If now this state at their pleasure, take this away and expel
men from the same, what were this but to exercise robbery, and to vex the poor
and the needy, and oppress the stranger wrongfully, a sin forerunning
desolation, (Ezekiel. 22.29.) and such an one as will more ruin the state by the
execution thereof, than those persons (whom the law intend to expel) were the
law abolished.

The 6th reason assigned is this, If strangers have right to our houses or
lands, etc. then it is either of justice or mercy, etc.

Answ. The question still is changed, but in answer to this we say, such may
the stranger be as have true right of cohabitation, and sojourning with us, as
has been showed, and that of justice, by his majesty's pattent, for they are
fellow subjects to one and the same prince, they are also of the same nation,
and if they be christians they are in a far nearer relation than all these,
even fellow brethren, and coheires of all the blessings laid up for them in
Christ Jesus, and in all these considerations have right of cohabitation and
residence with us.

The 7th reason is this, A familye is a little commonwealth and a
commonwealth is a great familye, now a familye is not bound to entertain all
comers, no not every good man, otherwise than by way of hospitalitye, no more
is a commonwealth.

Answ. Here again the question is much changed, it should not have been proved
that we are not bound to receive all comers nor all good men, but rather no
comers at all, unless it be upon the unlimitted consent of the magistrates.
Although it be true, that there is some proportion between a familye and a
commonwealth, yet there is a great disparitye in this matter. A master of a
familye has another kind of right to his house and estate than this
commonwealth has to all the houses and lands within this patent. The master
of a familye may bequeath his whole estate to his wife and children, and so may
not the body of this commonwealth to theires. The king will look for some
right, nor may we blame him, if he do. Many are no members of the
commonwealth, and yet have good right both to houses and lands here, many
members of this state agree not to this law, but have protested against it as
sinnfull and unwholesome, and yet we hope the rest have not as good right to
their houses goods and lands as the master of the familye has to his. If the
state should take upon them such a right, I pray you consider whether it would
not prove a greater wrong, even like to that of Labans toward Jacob, who told
him that all were his, Genesis 31.43. It is to be feared such pleas of right will
work more trouble to this state, if they be noysed abroad, than the
entertainment of those people against whom this law is made.

Eighthly it is thus reasoned, It is a general rule, turpius ejicitur quam non
admittitur hospes, it is worse to receive a man whom we must cast out, than to
deny him admittance.

Answ. Let any man resolve these words, and they will be far from proveing
the equitye, though they may perhaps the intent of the courts order. The thing
which from hence is concluded will only amount to this. That it is worse for a
commonwealth to receive a man whom they must cast out again, than to deny him
admittance. The reason is taken from humane authority, but what is this to the
point in controversye, why should men thus argue, and their conclusions so
far from the mark, yet as we said perhaps this may show the courts intent,
for this intimation we have from hence, That the intent of the commonwealth is
to cast out all such as have been received in times past, who are of the same
judgment with them, whom the magistrates will not admit but cast out, though
with a great deal more dishonestye, for turpius ejicitur, etc. which if it
must be, the Lords will be done. Mr. Vane's adherents were afterward banished.
See Mass. Hist. Vol. p. 75.


Ninthly, it is thus further argued, The rule of the Apostle, John 2.10. is,
that such as come and bring not the true doctrine with them should not be
received to house, and by the same reason not into the com.wealth.

The question is still wonderfully changed, for if the order now in question
were but conformable to this rule of the Apostle none would oppose it, but the
order is therefore scrupelled, because it setts down no rule for the
magistrates to walk by in that admittance or rejection of such as come, but
leaves it to their illimitted consent or dissent, nay such were the expressions
of the same, in the court, who had a hand in this law, as cleares it to us that
this law opposes directly this rule; for such as do bring the doctrine
intended in the text, are the persons which are aimed at to be denied
residence, as sad experience also in the execution has given us in part to
see already, and we fear in the future will yet do more.

The 10th and last reason is this in effect, Such may not come into the land as
by the consent of all are to be rejected, and therefore it is lawful to take
notice of them.

We much marvel that it should be so often said, the law is only for taking
notice, is it not plain that such are to be fined who receive them whom the
magistrates allow not? and cannot notice be taken of men without such a course
as this? Why should any in higher place speak in open court -- Let us have
their money first? -- What means the words immediately following which speak
of rejecting and keeping out by virtue of this order, if it were only made to
take notice of such? It would have done very well to have kept to the question,
and not argue so far distant from the purpose as this does. What if some come
into the land and are to be rejected, are any therefore to be rejected in an
undue and sinnful way? In the enlargement of this reason the law is excused, if
it be not rightly executed, and they which are to execute it are likewise
defended, if they follow their judgments and consciences. The law is excused
because it has a good intent, but good intents do not make a law or action
good, what was intended the execution does declare. Now is it sufficient for
those who are betrusted with the execution of this law to follow their
persuasions, judgments, and consciences, except they be rightly ruled by the
word of truth? Paul was persuaded that he should do those things which he did
against Jesus of Nazareth, Acts 26.9. They which kill Gods children may think
they do God good service, John 16.1. but in so doing, neither the one nor the
other are to be excused. It is not a full persuasion that makes a thing
lawful from the rule Romans 14.5. but a full persuasion upon good grounds. All
the actions of christians must be according to the rule Christ gives them to
walk by, Gal. 6.6.

Object. 1. Some profane persons are received, and others who are religious
are rejected. To which you answer there is no such thing known to be done, and
if it were it might be justified, because profane persons may be less
dangerous, than such as are religious, of large parts, confirmed in some
erroneous way, our Savior conversed with publicans, etc. and said they were
nearer the kingdom of heaven than religious pharisees. This is the sum. As
for the objection which is made, it is your own; for any thing we know, we
would not object in this manner. It is not the refusing of some religious
persons against which we except, but against the liberty which is given by
this law of rejecting those, that are truly and particularly religious, if the
magistrates do not like them, which is already put in practice, as far as
may be judged. If you deny any thing to be done, there are diverse witnesses
will affirm the contrary. If you say it be more dangerous to accept such than
profane persons you need not much confutation, such shall be blessings
wheresoever they come, Genesis 12.2. they will not need to be bound to the peace
or good behavior as some that are admitted by authority by their blasphemous
and quarrelling speeches. As for scribes and pharisees we will not plead for
them, let them do it who walk in their way; nor for such as are confirmed in
any way of error, though all such are not to be denied cohabitation, but are
to be pitied and reformed, Jude 22, 23. Ishmael shall dwell in the presence of
his brethren, Genesis 16.12.

Object. 2. It is objected that by this law we reject good christians and so
consequently Christ himself, and it is made of purpose to keep away such as
are of Mr. Wheelwrights judgment. To the former part of this objection you
say, it is not known that any christian man has been rejected, and that
christians in some cases may be rejected, holding some pernicious errors. This
is the substance.

To which we answer that diverse christians have been already rejected so
far, as they are not allowed to make any abode amongst us, but for a short
limited time, and by the law they may be rejected for ever. All the time such
are rejected Christ is rejected, Luke 10.16. Acts 9.4. Suppose some christians
may be refused and Christ not refused (which is not yet proved) that is nothing
to the law nor to the present execution of it. If you deal with such make it
appear. To the latter part of this objection you answer, that you cannot
confess that it is made against them of Mr. Wheelwights judgment, and if it
were, where is the evil of it, seeing that the opinions are such as he
professes cannot stand with external peace, and will cause divisions, and will
make the people look at their magistrates, ministers and brethren, as enemies
to Christ and antichristian, more dangerous than the opinion of Mr. Williams?
We omit diverse words for brevityes sake and change not the matter. To this we
replye, that though you cannot confess it, yet it does appear by your
examinations of them you refuse, for present demanding of them whether they
know him, and wishing of them to disclaim his doctrine, and excepting against
them because they are allied to them of the same judgment, as likewise by the
courts proceeding against him, that there is some such thing; though indeed we
would not make this objection, though some of the like kind.

Now whereas you grante this by way of concession, and give reasons to justify
the same, they are either weak or great mistakes. First you find fault with
his opinions, because he said they could not stand with external peace. He
affirmed indeed that the preaching of the gospel could not stand with
external peace, and does not the word of God hold this forth? Our Savior came
not to send peace but a sword, Matthew. 10.34. That chapter speaks fully to the
purpose, and when news of Christ comes, Herod and all Jerusalem is troubled,
Matthew. 2.3. Paul and Silas were accused for turneing the world upsyde down,
Acts 17.5. We question not but he will grante that the Lord can and does
sometimes give his church rest, Acts 9.31. but this will not stand nor
continue, which we know to be his meaneinge. A man cannot be Christ's disciple
but he must meet with crosses, Matthew. 16.24. Esau and Jacob wrestled together
in their mothers womb, Genesis 25.22. In the 2d place you except against his
opinions, because they make devisions. The gospel which he or any man holds
forth will cause devisions by accident, Matthew. 10.34.35. If he be blamed for
this, Christ cannot be excused. The 3d thing you allege is that his opinions
make people look at their magistrates, ministers and brethren as
antichristians, enemies to Christ, but we know no such doctrine which he
taught, all which he delivered concerning this matter, was a description of the
way of works and antichristianisme, and so far as magistrates and ministers
walk in that way they are to be looked at as antichristian, John 4.1, 2, 3.
Lastly, it is said that his opinions are more dangerous than those of Mr.
Williams which, if it be true, then is the doctrine of the gospel more
dangerous than that for which Mr. Williams was banished; for as yet we know
nothing which Mr. Wheelwright held dissonant from the gospel, neither has he
been confuted, though condemned, and it is not our judgments so much as the
cause which is changed.

These objections and answers being viewed, and what is unsound refuted, we
come to the conclusion, wherein we are desyered to judge what evil we find in
the law, and this we will do faithfully by the help of Christ. This law we
judge to be most wicked and sinful, and that for these reasons.

1. Because this law does leave these weightye matters of the commonwealth, of
receiving or rejecting such as come over to the approbation of magistrates, and
suspends these things upon the judgment of man, whereas the judgment is Gods,
Deuteronomy. 1.17. This is made a ground work of gross popery. Priests and
magistrates are to judge, but it must be according to the law of God, Deuteronomy.
17.9, 10, 11. That law which gives that without limittation to man, which is
proper to God, cannot be just.

2. Because here is liberty given by this law to expel and reject those which
are most eminent christians, if they suite not with the disposition of the
magistrates, whereby it will come to pass, that Christ and his members will
find worse entertainment amongst us than the Israelites did amongst the
Egyptians and Babilonians, than Abram and Isaac did amongst the Philistines,
than Jacob amongst the Shechemites, yea even than Lot amongst the Sodomites.
These all gave leave to Gods people, to sit down amongst them, though they
could not claim such right as the Kings subjects may. Now that law, the
execution whereof may make us more cruel and tyrannical over Gods children
than Pagans, yea than Sodomites, must needs be most wicked and sinful.

3. This law does cross many laws of Christ, Christ would have us render unto
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, Math. 22.21. But this law will not give
unto the Kings majesty his right of planting some of his subjects amongst us,
except they please them, Christ bids us not to forget to entertain strangers,
Heb. 13.2. But here by this law we must not entertain, for any continuance of
time, such stranger as the magistrates like not, though they be never so
gracious, allowed of both by God and good men, except we will forfeite unto
them our whole estates, it may be and much more than our estates comes unto.
Christ commands us to do good unto all, but especially to them of the household
of faith. Many other laws there are of Christ, which this law dasheth against,
and therefore is most wicked and sinful.

A Reply to an Answer made to a Declaration of the Intent and Equity of the
Order made at the Court in May last, whereby none are to be received etc. but
by allowance of the Magistrates. This Court was held at Newtown, now Cambridge,
in May 1637.

COntentions among brethren are sad spectacles, among the churches of Christ,
especially when they come once to savor of bitterness, which would have
discouraged me from publishing the former declaration, if I could have expected
such an answer: And in that respect I should willingly have sitten down under
my reproach, if the cause of truth and justice had not called me again to this
task; wherein, if I deal more sharply, than mine own disposition leads me,
the blame must fall upon him, who puts such occasions upon me, as I cannot
otherwise shun.

Many faults does the Answerer find in my declaration. which I must examine as
they come in order. The 1st is, that in describing a common wealth (such as
ours is) I do not describe it, as it is christian, nor as it is founded upon
the grant of our King.

To this I replye 1st, the defininition or description of the genus may be
applied to all the species, reserving the specificall differences: To define a
man to be a reasonable creature is a true definition of any man, whether rich
or poor, christian or heathen: and when I describe a common wealth in general
or in a more civil or politic respect, the churches or christians which are
in it, fall not into consideration, as to the being of it, for it may be a true
body politic, though there be neither church nor christian in it.

The like may be said for the form of government, whether it be by patent or
otherwise yet it is a government, and so the description is safe and true.

2d. The description which I make does include all that which he does complain
to be wanting. The words are these. A company of people, consenting to cohabite
under one government, for their mutual safety and welfare. Now let ours be
laid to this description and the truth will appear. We A.B.C. etc. consented
to cohabite in the Massachusetts, and under the government set up among us by
his Majesty's patent or grant for our mutual safety and welfare, we agreed to
walk according to the rules of the gospel. And thus you have both a christian
common weal and the same founded upon the patent, and both included within my
description.

I will add only what I conceive from this and other like passages in his
answer, viz. that he makes this exception rather to shelter himself under
pretense of his renderness of the kings honor and right, than out of any
ignorance of the true latitude of my description; and withal he discovers how
little he regards what jealousyes he put us under, so he may shelter his own
parties. The Lord give him to see his secret underminings, that it may be
forgiven him. Having thus faulted my description, he takes upon him to teach
me a better; and for this he refers me, by a marginal quotation to Proverb 8.5.
the text is this, Oh ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an
understanding heart; and to Isai. 6.7. And he laid it upon my mouth and said
lo this has touched thy lips etc. How these places will prove his
description of a christian common wealth, founded upon the kings patent is
beyond my reach, but it suits well with a practice now in use, to speak nothing
but what they bring scripture for; so scripture be alleged it matters not how
impertinent they be.

As for your description it self, I have no more to say against it, but that it
was not requisite, to that which I projected, to express those particulars;
and our lawyers will tell you that expressio eorum quae tacit insunt nihil
operatur: My intent was to prove the proprietye and privileges of a common
weal which may also belong to such government among Turks and Pagans, so far
as they may fall within my description without any prejudice to the most
christian government, that is, as if I speak of one that is an honest man, and
say that he goes upright, speaks, laughs, etc. when a Turk or a Pagan does
the same.

His next exception is, that I say that such a body politic may use all means,
which may conduce to their welfare, and do not restrain it to lawful means.

To this I reply, that it is according to scripture phrase, and our common
speech. When we call upon a sick man, to use means for his recoverye, we are
well enough understood, though we put not the word lawful: I may do all things,
says Paul, and give all diligence says Peter, without expressing lawful,
which the Answerer would have understood well enough, if he had not been
minded to seek a knot in a rush; only I see not why he should pass over those
many things which he says are questionable in my ground work, and take up
those which will afford so little advantage.

Then he proceeds to examine the reasons which I laid down to prove the
equity of this law.

The first reason is this, "If we be a corporation established by free consent,
if the place of our habitation be our own -- then no man has right to come in
to us, without our consent."

To this he answers, that "he knows not how we who stand a corporation by the
Kings patent can thus argue." To this I replye then. I will tell him, that
which the King is pleased to bestow upon us, and we have accepted, is truly our
own.

2. He denies the consequence by a distinction of a consent regulated, and a
vast and illimited consent.

Replye: To speak of consent in general, implies always a consent suitable
to the power or interest of him who is to give it; as when we say, a child may
not marrye without consent of parents, we know it is regulated, yet when a
father pleads it, he does not need to express all the limitations.

Thus he runs on in a frivolous discourse, and in the end falls upon this false
conclusion, "An unlawful dissent can hinder no man," So that if he had need to
borrow my horse, and I ought by the rule of love to lend him to him, though I
refuse to consent to his request herein, yet he may take him, because my
dissent is unlawful; so by this conclusion a wife, a child, a servant may do
any thing that is lawful, though the husband, father, or master deny their
consent. If this speed well, the next conclusion will be an anarchie.

After this discourse I expected somewhat to have taken away the consequence of
my argument, but I find not a word to that purpose, he is suddenly fallen
upon my second reason, which is this,

"If no man has right to our land, etc. but by our consent, then it is reason
we should take nottice of men, before we confer any such upon them."

This he partly grants, but complains of the change of the question, to which
I replye that I did not propound any reasons in a syllogisticall frame, but by
way of discourse, and that which this argument tends unto was only to show why
some were not presently allowed, but a time taken, wherein we might gain some
nottice and trial of them, and there was no need why the answerer should so
often complain of the change of the question; for if he takes my reasons
together he cannot deny but the question itself is argued and concluded, as
will appear by the sequel, I will therefore pass by all that he strives
about, upon this supposed fallacy, and join with him in the question, as he
states it, viz.

Whether the admitting or rejecting of persons should depend upon the
discretions of men, which he calls an unlimitted and unsafe rule and their
discretion not regulated, though they should be magistrates.

To this I replye, or rather answer, first, That which he takes for granted,
and wherein lies the whole strength of his defense is untrue, viz. That the
magistrates will and discretion in our case is not regulated, for 1st, the
magistrates are members of the churches here and, by that covenant, are
regulated to direct all their ways by the rule of the gospel, and if they
fail in any thing, they are subject to the churches correction. 2dly. As they
are freemen, they are regulated by oath, to direct their aims to the welfare
of this civil body. 3dly. As they are magistrates, they are sworn to do
right to all, and regulated by their relation to the people, to seek their
welfare in all things; so as here is no such irregulated discretion as is
supposed, and it seems to me an improper speech and savouring of contradiction;
for discretion always implies a rule for its guide. And herein I have occasion
to take in his answer to my 4th reason drawn from the practice of our
churches, and some towns where matters of admitting or rejecting are ordered by
discretion. And here it is made a wonder that I show so much ignorance. I must
confess my ignorance is great, and I cannot hide it, being exposed so much as
I am to public view: Yet that will not cover the answerers blindness, from
prejudice in this great wonder, which is such as he cannot discern the voice
and will of Christ dispensed in the discretion of his servants and people, and
yet tells us not how it should be known otherwise. Did he never hear. that
our practice is, that none are propounded to the congregation, except they be
first allowed by the elders, This must needs render the influence of the Clergy
very great under the old Constitution. No body could be proposed to the Church
for a Member unless the Minister allowed it. No body could be admitted a
freeman unless he was a Member of the Church.
and is not this to admit or reject by discretion? Did he never hear of a
christian man rejected by the church, or put off at least, because a brother
has professed want of satisfaction? Has he never heard that the dissent of
some few brethren may, by rule, (as has been said) cause the rejection of a
man, whom all the rest of the brethren shall approve of? And where is Christ's
voice to be heard now, if he will have discretion shut out of the church. So
says the instance of towns matters (which he wisely declines and gives no
answer to) he well knows that within the town of Boston it is an established
order, that none should be received into cohabitation there, except they be
allowed by certain men appointed to judge of their fitness for
church fellowship. And so, whereas the way of God has always been to gather
his churches out of the world; now, the world, or civil state, must be raised
out of the churches. And yet the answerer can find nothing of wonder of
ignorance here. And if he had enquired of our neighbors at Plymouth, they
could have told him that their practice has been upon the like law, for many
years, I mean in referring it to the discretion of the magistrates to receive
and reject such as come to them. And if he had considered of a rule in the law
of Moses, he should find that there is power given to a husband or father to
allow or make void any vow of a wife or child at their discretion, yet I hope
he will not call this a vast and unlimitted rule.

But because the word discretion seems so offensive and unsafe, let us try it
by the balance of the sanctuarye, if we can find it to hold weight there,
sure it will prove a good measure for civil affairs.

The word in scripture is sometimes taken for sound reason, as Psalm. 112.5. He
will order his affairs by discretion; so Pro. 11.12. Sometimes for
understanding, as Pro. 19.11. Isai. 28.26. Sometimes for skill, as Pro- 2.11.
Pro. 3.21. Sometimes for judgment, Phill. 1.9. And in all places in a good
sense, for it is a gift of God wherein he despenseth his own wisdom in all the
affairs of men, both in church and common wealth; all laws are made by
discretion, and the equity of them is found out and applied to particular
cases by discretion; by it (being guided by the spirit of God) the mind and
will of God is found out in his word, Acts 5.8 and Acts 8.23. Acts 15.38. Acts
21.23. Levit. 27.8, 12. So for judgment in civil causes; by discretion did
Solomon judge between the harlots. It is not possible to provide a law that in
the letter of it shall reach every case which may fall out, as we see by the
law of God it self in the same place of Levit. 27.8. then it must rest in the
discretion of the judge to discern, so does the Lord himself appointe, Deuteronomy.
17.8.9. etc. they are to do as the judge shall determine, and that which he
shall declare for law, that must they obey, otherwise there could be no
determination in hard and doubtful cases. As for these scriptures which the
Answerer alleges about Christ his souerainty, etc. they are nothing to the
question; for the prerogative authority of Christ in all affairs in church and
common wealth, does not hinder the manner of his dispensations of the ministry
of his servants, and in the improvement of such gifts of his, of wisdom,
discretion, etc. as he is pleased to exercise his authority in, according to
the rule of his word.

My 5th reason is, that it is no sin or injury to deny a man that which he
has no right unto, therefore we may deny some men place amongst us. In the
answer, there is again complainte of changing the question, because I go about
to prove that some men may be rejected, which he seems to grant, and if so
then that which he makes the maine question will easily be cleared, for if we
may reject some, then the care of this must be committed to some persons, for
to speak of discerning Christ his authority in church or common wealth,
otherwise than as it is dispensed in the ministry of men, is a mere idea or
fantasye. If then it must be committed to some persons, to whom may it more
properly than to the fathers of the common wealth? And if it cannot be
foreseen who are to be received and who to be rejected, those persons must be
trusted with the trial of them, and if no certain rule can be set down which
may be sufficient to discern of every man, then must it be committed to their
discretion, regulated by the word of God, and the duty of their place, which
they are bound to observe. And whereas the Answerer cries out against this
course as vast, illimitted, sinefull and injurious, and yet will not (and
cannot) prescribe us a better, neither in his answer, nor at the court when he
opposed the making of this law, may we not safely judge that such opposition
and those reproachful terms as are cast from it, upon an ordinance of God, in
the faces of those whom he would have to be had in honor for his sake, proceed
rather from distemper of mind, than from any just cause of offense?

Now here I might strike him with his own weappon, for when he seeks to prove
that any of the kings subjects, have right by our patent to come and plant in
places not inhabited, he changes the question indeed, for both the law and our
dispute have been about entertaining into houses and towns, and not into
places not inhabited. That question may fall to be discussed upon some other
occasion.

Again (that we may take notice how his zeal for the cause outrunes his
judgment) he gives to all the kings christian subjects a right to plant among
us, by virtue of our patent, and such a right as by misusage whereof they may
forfeit the patent, and here he might fitly have brought in his vast and
illimitted terms, had he not misplaced them, for have, for there was never
seen such a vast patent of incorporation as should comprehend all the kings
christian subjects, which is as large as if he had said all his subjects.

But that others may see his error, if he himself will not, let the patent be
perused, and there it will be found, that the incorporation is made to certain
persons by name, and unto such as they shall associate to themselves, and all
this tract of land is granted to them and their associates: And after this he
gives leave to any of his subjects to depart out of his other dominions to this
place: So then the case stands thus, the 10 men of Boston allow a strainger
to sit down among them, yet this gives him no right to any man's house or land,
nor to any lot in the town, till it be granted him, nor to any privilege there
till he be made free; we must have a new sort of reason to make this a good
argument; the King gives a man leave to inhabit in the incorporate colony of
the Massachusetts, ergo, he has hereby right to the lands there. His discourse
about the matter of general right by patent is so confused and irrational, as I
should but waste time and paper to follow him in it, valeat ut valere potest. I
find nothing in it which may endainger my argument, except it be put out of
countenance, by a false clamor of robbery, vexation, oppression, etc. as if
the state here went about to take from men their lawful right and expel them
from their houses, etc.

The 6th reason is this, if straingers have right to our houses, etc. then it
is either of justice or of mercy, etc.

The answerer, after his wonted prejudice of change of the question, undertakes
to prove, that some straingers have right in justice by the Kings patent, only
he restrains it to cohabitation and sojourning (which will conclude nothing
for him, seeing this law does not shutt out all straingers) The reasons he
brings are three, the 1st, because they are fellow subjects, 2dly, because
they are of the same nation, 3dly, because they are christians.

To this I replye, that I have already cleared this point in laying open the
extent and meaneing of the patent, and this I may say further, that I have
read over all the laws of England and all the general customs and privileges
of the Kings subjects there, but I have not found any thing that may give the
least color for such a privilege as is pretended.

As for that of christianitye I have granted in my declaration that there is a
right of hospitalitye, but for other right of cohabitation or sojourning it
must be considered in such special cases, as may fall out and cannot be
provided for by general rule.

My 7th reason is drawn from the proportion or resemblance that a
commonwealth has to a familye, which is not bound to entertain all comers,
no not every good man, otherwise than by way of hospitalitye.

The answerer (his complainte of changing the question premised) seeks to
disprove the proportion, by distinguishing between the right which the master
of a familye has to his house, etc. and the right which this common wealth
has to all the houses, etc. within this paient. This he amplyfyes by
particular instances. 1. in power of bequeathing them to his wife and children.
2. In regard of the King's right. 3. In respect of such as are no members, etc.
and yet have right to their houses, etc. 4. In regard to such as have protested
against this law.

To this I replye, that it is not needful they should hold proportion in all
respect. It is sufficient if they hold in that which is intended, viz. liberty
to receive or reject; which being known to all and confessed by the answerer,
in granting that some may be rejected, is sufficient to make good the argument
drawn from this similitude: yet to make it more clear, I replye to these
instances.

To the first I say, that a body politic may leave their houses, etc. to
their successors, which are in the place of their children. 2. For the Kings
right, that being paramount, hinders no more in a commonwealth than it does in
a familye, for he has the same interest in the houses, etc. of the father of a
familye. 3. For such as are no members they are as sojourners in a familye, who
though they have right to be in the familye themselves, yet may not receive in
any to reside in their particular chambers, without consent of the master of
the familye. 4. For such as protested against this law, that protestation
comes too late (except they first convince us of the injustice of the law)
seeing they formerly gave an implicit consent to all the wholesome laws and
orders of the body; neither need we fear to proclaim our right to our houses,
etc. against all intruders, more than particular persons and corporations may
do in England, notwithstanding his Majesty's interest in them also. Such
objections are not worth any answer.

In his answer to my 8th reason, viz. Turpius eijcitur quam non admittititur
hospes, he says it is of human authority, and that my conclusions are far
from the mark.

To this I replye, that though this sentence be human, yet the equitye of it
is strengthened by divine truths: It had been less grief to Abraham not to
have received Hagar to his bed then it was after to cast her out; and it was
turpius for Tobija and his stuff to be cast out of the temple, then it would
if he had not been received in. Now that it may appear how far my conclusion
is from the mark, I will thus lay down the argument. That law which shuts out
such as being received in, shall be worthy to be cast out is honest and of good
report, but this law does so, ergo, etc.

The major proposition is proved by the examples of Hagar and Tobija, the minor
I prove thus; the law provides to have such kept out as will disturb the peace
here, rightly established by the rules of Gods word, ergo, etc. except the
argument may be avoided, the conclusion will hitt the mark.

But the Answerer says that, 1. Such ones as are intended to be kept out, are
no disturbers of our peace. 2. That the law does not declare who are to be kept
out and who not.

To these I replye first, for brevitys sake let the apology and the
remonstrance, with the coppie of the whole sermon (which himself delivered
into the court) be compared and examined, and they shall decide the question,
if you will stand to it.

To the second I replye, that yourselfe confesses who the law intended to keep
out; and though such a preamble as might have expressed the full intent, was
(for want of time) omitted (which was indeed a defect) yet such as were of the
court, and did well know, can make no such advanvantage of it, seeing the
magistrates have other rules to guide them in the execution of it; and so it is
warranted by scripture examples as that of our savior Math. 16.19. and 18.18.
whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven etc. yet he does not
there tell them, who they ought to bind or loose.

The 9th argument is taken from that of the 2 John 10. Such as bring not the
true doctrine are not to be received to house, and consequently not into the
common wealth.

The Answerer (after his usual complainte of the change of the question)
acknowledges, that if the order had been made against such it would not have
been opposed; but affirms that it appears (by the same expressions in the
court, and by the execution of the law in part) that this law is made to keep
out such as bring the true doctrine of the gospel, so that now he has brought
the question to this state, whether the opinions spread in the country. and
opposed by the magistrates and elders, be the doctrines of the gospel or not,
which seeing it is to be decyded by the synod assembled, it will be best to
attend the issue thereof.

In his answer to the 10th reason, he does only discourse and find fault with
a conclusion which is of his own framing (for I do not conclude that the law
was only for taking notice of such as come to us, but I add also the end of
such notice, viz. for avoiding such as are to be kept out) which being all
included in one parentesis, it is more than a slip thus to mistake it.

And whereas he charge me, as if I grounded the law upon no better foundation
than a good intent, the reader may easily judge that it is a mere slander: For
I lay down the order of the law to be, that such should not be received into
our fellowship who are likely to disturb the same; and thence I infer that
this intent is lawful and good.

The like cast he has at the persuasion and conscience of such as are to
execute this law: And here I must make bold to ask him this question, viz.
Seeing you are bound by your oath in all causes wherein you are to give your
vote for elections, etc. to go according to your conscience, if then one be
propounded to be chosen a magistrate, and you are persuaded in your conscience,
by the best knowledge you can get of him, that he is not fit for that place,
whether are you to give your vote for him or not? When you have answered this
question, I will replye further to you: And with all I desire the answerer to
take this along with him; that this law concerning the freemens oath, whereunto
all the godly of this commonwealth consented, (and which referrs the judgment
of persons and churches in that cause to the conscience and persuasion of
christian men) was never yet held to be a vast and illimitted rule.

The Answerer proceeds to the objections, and least his arguments should not
reach his aim, he speaks to prejudice the readers judgment, by averring much
unsoundnes, etc. beforehand, but I must entreat him to make a better discovery
ere it be yielded.

The 1st objection is, that some profane persons are received and others who
are religious are rejected.

The answerer disclaymes this objection as none of theirs, which matters not
greatly. I know from whom I heard it, though he did not; yet he might as well
own it, as offer to prove that such as are truly and christianly religious
have been rejected, except he will deny such to be religious: But I affirm
still, as I did before, that I know of none such, who have been rejected, nor
any such blasphemers or quarrellers (as he speaks of) to have been received.

In his answer to my solution of this objection, I only observe this, that
whereas my argument is by way of comparision between a young prophaine person
and an elder professor confirmed in some error, he gain says the comparison
by introduction of Abraham, who was a blessing to others; but alleges not any
opposite member; but sure he was in a great straight, otherwise he would not
have held forth the father of the faithful as such an one, as he must produce
to answer my comparison; but it well accords with his own tenent, that he must
have leave to advance his own party, whatever danger or damage befall others
by it.

After this he takes upon him to prove, that all such as are confirmed in any
way of error, are not to be denied cohabitation, but are to be pittyed and
reformed, for this he alleges two places of scripture, Jude 22, 23. Genesis
16.17.

To this I replye 1st, Let it be observed how this answers my argument. I
endeavored to prove that some professors were to be denied cohabitation,
rather than some prophaine ones, for this reason, viz. because they may be more
dangerous. His answer is, that all such as are confirmed in any way of error
are not to be denied, etc. and omitts that wherein the weight of the argument
lies, viz. their being dangerous to public peace. 2dly, I deny that these
scriptures prove his proposition, for that in Jude speaks nothing of
cohabitation, or confirmation in error, nor speaks he to magistrates, or such
as had power, to receive or reject, etc. and if he will bring that place to his
purpose it will infer this conclusion, that no compassion is to be had of
such as we may deny cohabitation unto. As for that, Genesis 16.12. it is as
little to the purpose. Ismaell dwelt in the house of his brethren, but not
among them; so, by our law, such as we hold not fit to dwell among us are not
denied to dwell by us.

Another objection is, "that by this law we reject true christians, and so
consequently Christ himself."

The solution of this objection is, that in some cases a man that is a true
christian may be rejected or denied residence, and yet Christ not rejected; for
proof whereof I instance in diverse particulars, all which he passes by,
without any direct answer; but concludes, that is nothing to the law; which I
must leave to the reader to judge of, seeing he brings neither reason nor
scripture against it, to which I may replye.

After this he comes to the particular occasion of the law, and here he lays
about him in earnest, and strikes all that come in his way, magistrates,
elders, and all that do walk in that way which Mr. Wheelewright has described
to be a way of a covenant of works, and holds them forth as Antichrists; and
for proof hereof alleges that in 1 John 4.1, 2, 3. where the Apostle, giving a
rule to discover false spirits by, gives this as the mark, they confess not
that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, and such a spirit is of Antichrist. How
this place proves his assertion I am not able to discern: Sure I am that such,
as he casts under a covenant of works, do confess that Christ is come in the
flesh, but then I see that hereby he has brought the cause, which he is so
zealous for, into such a toil as all the skill he has cannot extricate,
unless (as before) he will draw in Abraham into the same estate of
antichristianism; seeing by that doctrine he walked in the same way of a
covenant of works, 14 years together, viz. while he kept Hagar, etc.

For his answer in defense of Mr. Wheelewright his opinions, I will make no
replye, but wait the success of the conference among the churches now
assembled.

In the last place he brings diverse reasons to prove "that this law is most
wicked and sinful."

His 1st reason is, this law gives that, without limitation, to men, which is
proper to God; and so is a ground of gross popery; for proof he cites Deuteronomy.
1.17. and 17.9, 10, 11.

To which I answer, that I have proved already that the magistrates are
limited both by their church covenant and by their oath, and by the duty of
their places, to square all their proceedings by the rule of Gods word, for
the advancement of the gospel and the weal public; neither does it cross
either of the places mentioned, for whatsoever sentence the magistrate gives,
according to these limittations, the judgment is the Lords, though he do it not
by any rule particularly prescribed by civil authority. As for that other
place in Deuteronomy. 17.9. it strengthens our law, and reflects sharply upon such as
do oppose it; for it straightly commands all persons to submitt to the
sentence of the judge, and to receive the exposition of the law from his mouth;
so as such gainesayers stand guilty of presumption in opposeing the sentence of
the judges, before they have clearly convinced them that their sentence is
contrary to the law of God.

As for that aspersion of popery, etc. it will draw no blood; his earnestnes in
the cause makes him thus to cast dirt upon his opposers, when he has spent his
shot.

2. His 2d reason against this law is, that it gives liberty to the
magistrates to expel and reject those who are most eminent christians, if they
suite not with the magistrates disposition; and thence concludes that Christ
and his members will find worse entertainment among us than the Israelites did
among the Egyptians and Babilonians, han Abraham and Isaac among the
Philistines, than Lot among the Sodomites, etc.

To this I answer, 1. His earnestnes confounds his memory; he knows well, that
this law gives no power to expel any, neither does it make the magistrates
disposition the rule for rejecting any; but this slander has been confuted
before. 2. For a brother in church covenant and a fellow member of such a
civil body as ours, to conclude so peremptorily of his fellow brethren,
favors of much arogance and desperate prejudice. If his charity can hope no
better of us, but that we will deal worse with Gods people than the Pagans
(and that before he has seen any experience of it) it is no marvel if he
favor such as have ranked us with the same before; only herein he deals
fairly with us, in giving us tymely warneing what to expect from the
imbittered mind of such a brother; but for his argument it self thus it
stands: The Egyptians, etc. gave leave to Gods people, to set down amongst
them: But the magistrates will not give leave, etc. ergo, they are worse than
the Egyptians, etc.

I answer, howsoever the magistrates cannot stopp his fury, yet we shall free
the law from the force of his argument: For except he had assumed thus, the
magistrates must or may etc. for it is nothing to the law, that they will do
so, seeing a magistrates will may transgress a good law, and if they should
do so, yet I deny that it is by the liberty of the law, which I shall not
need further to prove, seeing my denial will bear as much weight as his
affirmation.

3. His 3d reason is, this law does cross many laws of Christ. This he proves
by enumeration of 3 particulars, Matt. 22.21. Heb. 13.2. Gal. 6.10.

To this I answer, and 1. to that of Matt. 22.21. Give unto Caesar the things
which are Cesars. The reason lies thus: The King has right to plant any of his
subjects among us; but we deny to let him plant some of his subjects among us,
unless they please us; ergo, we deny to Caesar, etc. The proposition is false;
for I have proved before, that the King having given all the land within
certain limitts to the patentees and their associates, cannot send others to
possess that which he has granted before.

2. As for that in Heb. 13. it is nothing to the purpose; This law of the court
hinders not the entertainment of straingers so far as the rule of
hospitalitye requires; and there is no other intended in that place.

3. For that in Gal. 6. I confess the household of faith are principally to be
regarded; and it is apparent that the care of their welfare was the only
occasion and ground (next the glory of God) of the making of this law: For, the
court, taking nottice how the hearts of the faithful were sadded by the
spreading of diverse new and unfound opinions, and the uncharitable censures
which they lay under by occasion of them, how brotherly love and communion
decayed, how the ordinances of religion were neglected, and the faithful
dispensers thereof (sometimes more precious than fine gold) slighted and
reproached, throughout the whole country, they found it needful to provide
remedy in time, that it might go well with the household of faith, and though
the execution of this law should turn to the damage of some of this household,
yet better it is some member should suffer the evil they bring upon
themselves, than that, by indulgence toward them, the whole familye of God in
this country should be scattered, if not destroyed.

His last argument (by which we may see that he meant not to quitt the cause, so
long as his breath would hold) is this, This law dasheth against many other
laws of Christ ergo, it is most wicked and sinful.

To which my answer may be short, and yet sufficient to withstand the force of
his argument. This law dasheth not against any law of Christ; ergo, it is just
and good.

A Coppie of a Letter sent by the appointment of the Lords of the Council to
Mr. Winthrop, for the Patent of this Plantation to be sent to them.
At Whitehall April 4th 1638. Present, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury Lord
Keeper Lord Treasurer Lord Privy Seal Earl Marshall Earl of Dorset Earl of
Holland Lord Cottington Mr. Treasurer Mr. Controuler Mr. Secretary Cook Mr.
Secretary Windebank


THIS day the Lords Commissioners for foreign Plantations, taking into
consideration that the petitions and complaints of his Majestys subjects
planters and traders in New England grow more frequent than heretofore for want
of a settled and orderly government in those parts, and calling to mind that
they had formerly given order about two or three years since to Mr. Cradock a
member of that plantation, to cause the grant or letters patent of that
plantation (alleged by him to be there remaining in the hands of Mr.
Winthrop) to be sent over hither, and that notwithstanding the same, the said
letters patent were not as yet brought over: And their Lordships being now
informed by Mr. Attorney General that a Quo Warranto had been by him brought
according to former order against the said patent, and the same was proceeded
to judgment against so many as had appeared, and that they which had not
appeared, were outlawed.

Their lordships well approving of Mr. Attorney's care and proceeding therein
did now resolve and order, that Mr. Meawtis clerk of the council attendant upon
the said commissioners for foreign plantations should in a letter from himself
to Mr. Winthrop enclose and convey this order unto him. And their Lordships
hereby in his Majestys name, and according to his express will and pleasure
strictly require and enjoine the said Winthrop or any other in whose power and
custody the said letters patent are, that they fail not to transmit the said
patent hither by the return of the ship in which the order is conveyed to
them, it being resolved that in case of any further neglect or contempt by them
showed therein, their lordships will cause a strict course to be taken against
them, and will move his Majesty to reassume into his hands the whole
plantation. Whether the intent of this order was that the Patent should be sent
over that the Government of the Colony might be under a Corporation in England,
according to the true intent of the Patent, or whether it was that the Patent
might be surrendered, is uncertain.


Copy of Sir William Martin's Letter to Governor Winthrop, enquiring about the
State of the Colony.
I Am glad to hear of Mr. Nortons safe arrival, and should have been more
glad if it had been at the baye. I hope he will settle with you; his abilityes
are more than ordinary, and will be acceptable and profitable to the churches.
I have received Prats exposition from Mr. Downing; and in the main I find
little difference therein from his letter. I should be glad to be truly
informed by you, what You conceive of the soil and means of subsistances, and
whether that exposition agrees with the truth of things. I am sorry to hear of
Mr. Williams's separation from you: His former good affections to you, and the
plantations, were well known unto me and make me wonder now at his
proceedinges. I have wrote to him effectually to submit to better judgments,
and especially to those whom formerly he reverenced and admired; at least to
keep the bond of peace inviolable. This has been always my advise; and
nothing conduces more to the good of plantations. I pray show him what
lawful favor you can, which may stand with the common good. He is passionate
and precipitate, which may transport him into error, but I hope his integrity
and good intentions will bring him at last into the way of truth, and confirm
him therein. In the mean time, I pray God to give him a right use of this
affliction. Thus leavinge him to your favorable censures, and you all to the
direction of God, with my best respects to you and yours, I sign me

March 29. 1636. Your affectionate, W. M.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. George Fenwick Afterward Col. Fenwicke under the
Parliament and Cromwell. This Letter was wrote from Say Brook where he was
beginning a Plantation for Lord Say, Brook, etc.
to Governor Winthrop.
Sir,
I Thank you for your continued offices of love in your counsel to my
servant, while the Lord granted him health, and your kindness and respect to him
in his sickness; as the Lord shall offer me opportunity you shall ever find me
ready to perform the like or any other fruit of well affection for you or
yours. The change that his death has made in my occasions putts me upon much
new labor that I thought I had done with, and therefore I must be very brief
at present. I shall desire that those cattle that are in your hands or any
others may be continued as they were till next spring, when I shall, if the
Lord grant life, take order for them. I wrote to you concerning powder that was
left in the bay, the store we had here grows short, but I hope we shall have
noe need till next spring, until when I leave it also, only I directed my man
that if he saw it decaying, having been long kept, (though that we have here
holds yet well) he should sell 8 or 10 barrels of it. Concerning the last part
of your letter I can yet say little, only thus much that whatsoever tends to
mutual defense and shall conduce to the settling and maintaining unfeigned love,
you may expect from me and all those who are intrested in this place. For other
matters, as they are of great consequence and near concernment to others as
well as myself, I can at present say thus much only, that if there be any thing
betwixt you and the towns above, about bounds, whatsoever is concluded without
us hear I shall account invalid and must protest against it. I speak not this
out of any fear either of wrong or neglect from you or them, but to tell you
in short (having many other business) what I hold my self bound to do in that
particular, and when there shall be a fit time for any thing betwixt us you
shall find us in all things to submitt to right and good conscience. I am
lastly to thank you kindly on my wifes behalf for your great dainties; we both
desire and delight much in that primitive employment of dressing a garden, and
the taste of so good fruits in these parts gives us good encouragement. We
both tender our loves and respects to your self and bedfellow. If there be any
thing wherein you can use me, I am

Yours in any real office of love, Geo. Fenwicke.

Gyles Fyrmins Letter to Governor Winthrop, about his settling.
Much honored and dear Sir,
BUT that I think it needless (God havinge more than ordinarye fitted you for
such trials) my letter might tell you with what grief of spirit I received the
news of that sad affliction which is lately happened to your worship, by means
of that unfaithful wretch; I hope God will find a shoulder to help you bear
so great a burden. But the little time there is allotted me to write I must
spend in requesting your worships counsel and favor. My father in law Ward,
since his son came over, is varey desirous that we might set down together,
and so that he might leave us together if God should remove him from hence.
Because that it cannot be accomplished in this town, is verey desirous to get
me to remove with him to a new plantation. After much persuasion used,
consideringe my want of accommodation here (the ground the town having given
me lying 5 miles from me or more) and that the gains of physic will not
find me with bread, but, besides, apprehendinge that it might be a way to
free him from some temptations, and make him more cheereful and serviceable to
the country or church, have yielded to him. Herein, as I desire your counsel,
so I humbly request your favor, that you would be pleased to give us the
liberty of choosinge a plantation; we think it will be at Pentuckett, or
Quichichchek, by Shawshin: So soon as the season will give us leave to go, we
shall inform your worship which we desire: And if that, by the court of
election, we cannot gather a company to beegine it, we will let it fall. We
desire you would not grant any of them to any before we have seen them. If
your worship have heard any relation of the places, we should remain thankful
to you, if you would be pleased to counsel us to any of them. Further, I would
entreat for advise in this: The town gave me the ground (100 acres) upon
this condition, that I should stay in the town 3 years, or else I could not
sell it: Now my father supposes it being my first heritage (my father having
none in the land) that it is more than they can do to hinder me thus, when
as others have no business, but range from place to place, on purpose to live
upon the country. I would entreat your counsel whither or not I can sell
it. Further: I am strongly set upon to study divinity, my studyes else must
be lost: for physic is but a meene help. In these cases I humbly refer to
your worship, as my father, for your Counsel, and so in much haste, with my
best services presented to your worship, wishinge you a strong support in your
affliction, and a good and comfortable issue, I rest

Your worships in what he can to his power, Gyles Fyrmin. This Giles Firmin
was afterward a celebrated nonconformist Minister in England, and died there
after the Revolution.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Winslow to Governor Winthrop.
Worthy Sir,
HAD not the Almighty (who is righteous in the midst of man's unrighteousnes)
stirred up certain malicious and slanderous persons to defame me with
impudent, falfe and shameless reports, to my no small grief and trouble, I had
been with you before this day, knowing right well how comfortable the face of a
friend is in such sad conditions as yours at present. How I have been and am
affected with those losses and crosses as are befallen you by your unfaithful
servant, he that made the heart best knows. But when I consider how unhappy a
man may be, in the fullest and most plentiful enjoyment of worldly treasures,
then I judge you nearer happiness in the loss of them; not doubting but our
gracious God will sanctify his hand unto you, assuring myself it will be good
for you in the end. How prone would Gods people be to have their hearts
ensnared and taken up with the world and the riches and honors thereof, if he
should not sometimes show us their vanity. He that brought Job so low (after he
was humbled before him) blessed his latter days more than his former. We have
to do with the same God: He can do what he will, and let this be our comfort,
he will do what is best for us: Therefore let us show forth his praise by
patient submitting to his hand, joining therewith a diligent enquiry after the
cause twixt him and ourselves. I have too often used a foolish proverb, I had
rather be envyed than pittyed: But I find by lamentable experience Gods word
true, That none can stand before envy; and therefore prefer your condition
far before mine own, whom I conceive to be compassed about with friends. But
alas, however a friend loves at all times, now is the time of trial; and
herein (as many other ways) I doubt not but you will gain by your present
condition; which the Lord in mercy grant. What you wrote to our Governor he
imparted to me. Few or none of note have come from your parts this way of late,
by reason of the season: So that we hear not what order you have taken in your
business. If my presence may any way stand you in steed, you may command it,
and my best service therewith. I pray you, Sir, take it not ill that I am thus
plain. If I fail it is occasioned by my love, knowing right well how such an
unexpected straight may pinch a good estate, which I should be very sorry to
hear. Be you and yours saluted in the Lord, to whom my prayers are that his
comforts may exceed your crosses: And so desiring your prayers take leave,
remaining

Your assured friend, sympathizing with you, Edw. Winslow.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Thomas Jenner to Governor Winthrop.
Worthy Sir,
YOUR pious and good letter I received; for which I humbly thank you. Your
judicious counsel therein I lovingly embrace, as concurring fully with mine
own judgment: Hence have I not troubled the people at all with church
discipline, or constitutions of churches, etc. but have bent my whole studdies
to show them their miserable and lost estate without Christ, etc. Nor have I
enveyed, in the least measure, against the church of England (to my
remembrance) but have been (and still am) very fearful to give one word of
distaste about those things, but altogether do seek to gain them to Christ.
True, I do acknowledge that after I had been here for the space of a month or 6
weeks, and perceiving them very superstitious, (performing man's invention
rather than the instituted worship of God) now, that I might gain their good
esteem of Gods pure ordinances, and make them see the evil and folly of their
superstition and will worship, I made choice of Ps. 19. and 7. to handle it at
large: And, in one of the uses of reproof, I bent myself as strongly as I
could against the religion of the Papists, and condemned those practices, which
I saw the people here were superstitiously addicted to, in that use against the
Papists; whose religion I showed, at large, consisted either of a new
instructed worship not mentioned in the law of God, or of Gods instituted
worship miserably abused, either by their additions or diminutions; and showed
the particulars wherein. Now (I heartily thank God for it) it took a general
good impression, excepting Mr. Vines and one more who told me I struck at the
church of England, though I mentioned her not. Whereupon he pressed me to
dispute with him about one part, of baptizing infants with godfathers and
godmothers; the which I was very loath to dispute about; yet I saw that either I
must, or else sit down with shame, for he had called together his whole family
to hear it. Now, it pleased God so to strengthen me (through the riches of his
mercy) that he was utterly silent; and since that time has manifested more
respect and love to me and my master than formerly, and does take notes of the
sermons daily, and repeateth them in his family very orderly, as I am informed.

Thus, sweet Sir, I make very bold to inform your worship with the truth of
things, though not worth the writing.

I have been solicited both from the inhabitance of Stratens plantation and
from those of Caskoe, to be a means to help each of them to a godly minister;
wherefore I do make bold to entreat your worship to do your endeavor to
furnish them both.

Thus, hoping ere long to see your face, I leave you in the arms of our blessed
Savior, in whom also I rest,

Your worships to command, till death, Th. Jennet.
Saco, 26 of the 2d, 1641.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. Endecott to Governor Winthrop, about La Tour.
Dear Sir,
I Am glad that La Tour has not aid from us; and I could wish he might not
have any from the ships: For as long as La Tour and Daulney are opposites they
will weaken one another. If La Tour should prevail against him we shall
undoubtedly have an ill neighbor. His father and himself, as I am informed,
have shed the blood of some English already, and taken away a pinnace and goods
from Mr. Allerton. It were (I think) good, that that business were cleared
before he had either aid or liberty to hire ships, yea, or to depart.

Sir, it is not the manner abroad to suffer straingers to view forts or
fortifications, as it seems these French have done. I must needs say, that I
fear we shall have little comfort in having any thing to do with these
idolatrous French. The country hereabouts is much troubled that they are so
entertained and have their liberty as they have to bring their soldiers
ashore, and to suffer them to train their men. And great jealousies there are,
that it is not Daulney that is aimed at; seeing such a strength will neither
suit such a poor design, and La Tour a man of weak estate, as it is said.
Wherefore, other men's hands are employed, and purses too, for some other
service. But I leave all these things to your serious considerations, desireing
the Lord to guide you therein to the glory and peace of the churches here, to
whose grace I commit you and humbly rest,

Yours truly ever, Jo. Endecott.

Copy of a Letter from Thomas Gorges Son to Sir Ferdinando Gorges.
to Governor Winthrop.
Piscattaquake, 28 June 1643. Right worthy Sir,
I Understand by Mr. Parker that you have written to me by Mr. Shurt, which as
yet I have not received. It cannot be unknown to you the fears that we are in
since La Tours promise of aid from you; for my part, I thought fit to certifye
foe much unto you, and I doubt not only these parts which are naked, but all N.
E. will find D'Aulnay a scourge. He has long waited (with the expense of near
800 l. per month) for the apprehending of this supply, and if all his hopes
shall be frustrated through your aid, you may conceive where he will seek for
satisfaction. If a thorough work could be made, that he might utterly be
extirpated, I should like it well; otherwise it cannot be thought but a soldier
and a gentleman will seek to revenge himself, having 500 men, 2 ships, a
galley, and 3 pinnases, well provided: Besides you may please to conceive in
what manner he now besiedges La Tour, his ships lie on the S. W. part of the
island at the entrance of St. John's river, within which side is only the
entrance for ships, on the N. E. lie his pinnases; it cannot be conceived but
he will fortifye the island, which will debarr the entrance of any of your
ships and force them back, showing the will, having not the power, to hurt
him.

I suppose I shall for England in this shipp, I am not as yet certain, which
makes me forbear to be large at this time, or to desire your commands thither.
Thus in haste I rest,

Your honouringe friend and servant, Tho. Gorges.

Copy of a Letter from Richard Saltonstall and others to the Honorable
Governor, Deputy Governor, and Assistants, and the Reverend Elders at or near
the Bay.
Much honored in the Lord,
THough we do, and may truly, profess ourselves to be both unfit and
unwilling to interpose in a matter of such state and weight, as we conceive
this French affair to be, yet the honor we owe to the religion we profess,
the loyalty we bear to our native country, especially in its present condition
and the reference wherein it stands to the kingdom of France, out of respect
to the reputation of our government and governors, our tender care of the souls
and lives of such as are committed to the trust thereof, the eye of care we
ought to have upon our friends in the east, our regard to our christian
confederates, so lately combined with us, in confidence of our piety and
wisdom, and the religious discharge of our own consciences and duties, will
not permit us to be silent, so long as there is any room left for us to
speak. We have littel hope to revoke resolutions so far transacted and
ripned, but we presume it shall not be taken amiss, if we labor to wash our
hands wholly of this design, and what ill consequences soever it may produce.
The reasons moving us hereto, are our deep fears that the stated rules of
undertaking wars, either by proper and direct enterprise, or by lending aid,
have not been so duly observed, as we could wish.

1. The grounds of war ought to be just and necessary. For the justice of
this war by la Tour against Daulnay, we conceive that all the light and
information New England has, or may probably receive, cannot be sufficient for
us to determine it possitively; we understand it has been variously judged in
the courts of France, one while for Daulnay, another while for la Tour, and it
is not impossible that la Tour has now rather outfriended than outpleaded
Daulnay; we shall therefore run into an unchristian praemunire of presumption
if we resolve upon such an enterprise with an irresolved faith, in causa dubia
bellum non est suscipiendum. For the necessity of it, it must either be in
point of charity toward de la Tour or upon some engageing interest of our
own. For any bond of charity, we conceive the speech of the prophet to
Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19.2. and of Solomon, Proverbs 26.17. not only discharge
but strongly prohibit us. 1. For our own interest, if it be clear that
Daulnay has offered us such great wrong, as invites us to a war (which we
much question, for it must be atrox injuria) we suppose it would stand more
with the honor of our religion and plantation, to proceed professedly and
orderly against him, then for us English to become but margent notes upon a
French text, which to us is as yet but apocripha; and to undertake him upon
more certain grounds, and at a more seasonable time when he does less expect
us, and is not so well provided for us as now he is. Wars are extreme remedies
and are not to be enterprised unless their causes will bear out all manner of
effects and consequences, whether personal or national, which may ensue. And
what may not ensue, if either of the nations to whom we belong will comment
upon our action in a state language? And how apt a time this is for
misconstructions we cannot be ignorant. The spirit of war is scholastic and
jesuitical, traversing the very positions and principles, which peace has held
both dogmatical and irrefragable, even to the wonderment of rational men. We
are informed that Daulnay desires our friendship, and we are inclined to
believe that if it did as well become him to appeal to our judgment as it ill
beseemes us to expect it, he would not refuse to cast himself upon our
compromise.

2. Wars ought not to be undertaken without the counsel and command of the
supreme authority, whence expeditions issue. It is not hard to say, the
present reference between the kingdoms of England and France considered, that
the subjects of the one ought not to wage war against the other without a
public commission of state, unless it be in defense upon a sudden assault:
Neither do we yet hear that La Tour himself has any such commission for this
his action; though if he had it were little to us. It is a rule observed
amongst confederates, that during any league of peace between them, one friend
may not aid another against any part of his province, till that part be
proscribed by the authority of a general assembly whereof it is a member, and
the confederates assured thereof in a state way. The breach of this rule is a
breach of league. Public actions of hostility work far and wide, having
their national and confederal influences and consequences. The daggers we draw
here may happly prove swords in Christendom for ought we know.

But this design, whatever the cause was, seemed shy even of our New-English
Counsel to warrant and guide it: How closely it concerns the peace and safety
of the whole plantation may easily be conjectured, and how far it declined
the advice thereof in a representative course we are very sorry to consider or
mention.

We dare not so much impeach the honor of the advisours as to think they would
veil the action with this, that they only permit and give way to volunteirs;
for who knows not this to be a rule of state, that Not to forbid, when there is
notice and power, is to bidd.

This were also to proclaim our weakness, in prostrating our government to
nothing; for who is ignorant that To permit volunteers to issue out in aid of a
friend is never done without an act of state, where any state is?

Daulnay, nor France, are not so feeble in their intellectuals as to deem it
no act of state, when, upon consultation with some of our chief persons, our
men are suffered, if not encouraged, to go forth with our provision and
munition upon the design: We do therefore wonder that our people, having no
warrant from authority, will, of their own heads, run such a hazard of their
souls and lives, as can neither look for any prayers or thanks for their
good success, nor any succors if it sares ill, and as it may fall out, rather
call for the curses of their friends from whom they went, and of posterity yet
unborne, and yet these poor men presume that if Daulnay should say, as the
King of Egypt to Josiah, what have I to do with thee, thou King of Judah? I
come not out against thee this day, but against the house with whom I have
war, or if they should shed innocent blood or feel their own souls dropping
suddenly into hell, they had their warrant from the Counsel and countenance of
those upon whom they might and ought to confide. It were to be wished they had
been taught the Germane proverb, which says, He that loses his life in an
unnecessary quarrel dies the Devill's martyr. Had they had the voices of the
people with them, it had been better than nothing; but that wind seems to us
to blow strong in the teeth of their voyage. We shall presume to propound these
questions. 1. If Daulnay or France shall hereafter demand any of them from us
as enemies, or murderers, whether will our court protect or deliver them? 2.
If any of the parents or wives shall require their lives at our hands, who
shall answer them? 3. If any of their widows or children shall require
sustenance, or any maimed soldier in this expedition call for maintenance, who
shall give it them? or if taken captive and made slaves, who shall rescue or
redeem them?

3. The ends of war ought to be religious: What glory is intended hereby to
God we see not, and how our peace shall hereby be settled we foresee not, but
suspect it will rather be a beginning than an end of our troubles and fears,
if we do not wholly suppress Daulnay, we may be sure of it. He is already
very strong, and if our ships and munition fall into his hand, it will deminish
from us, and encourage, exasperate and strengthen him.

If La Tour prevail he is like to cavil with our men for some miscarriages,
or we with him for non-payment. The passage of our ships to and from England
has hitherto been quiet and safe, in regard of the French, but we cannot so
expect it hereafter, if they shall meet with any of La Tours or Daulnayes
special friends, or at least with the friends of such of them as we shall seem
to wrong. Bellum contra hostem non est suscipiendum cum periculo reipublicae,
etc.

4. Undertakings of wars ought to be probably feasible, but this seems not
so to us. We learn out of the East, be an eye witness, that Daulnay is very
strong, in artillery, men and munition, at land, and very well provided at sea,
insomuch that some of the East have consulted to repair to him in his aid,
least he should upon revenge annoy and ruin them; he is reported to be a
valiant, prudent and experienced soldier and commander, and defendants have
great advantages of assaylants, so that, we fear, our sheep have hastened to
their slaughter.

5. Lastly, The manner of enterprising war calls for many rules, according to
scripture and the custom of religious and ingenuous nations, as to summon and
give warning before they strike: To hear what the defendant can plead for the
justice of his cause, to offer terms of peace with equal articles, and to give
special cautionary commissions and commands how far to persist in aid, and
when to desist; but we neither can send fit men for such charges, nor can we
prescribe such directions, without a professed imbarquing ourselves in the
action; which, it seems, is wholly declined on our parts.

We therefore trouble you no further, only we itterate our protestation that we
are and desire to be held clear and innocent of this undertakeing, and

Your worships in all christian affection and services, Richard Saltonstall,
Simon Bradstreet, Samuel Simonds, Nath. Ward, Ez. Rogers, Nath. Rogers, John
Norton.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Endecott to Governor Winthrop, about the French.
Dearest Sir,
I Find that your troubles are many, and especially about this French
business. The Lord in mercy support you. I am much grieved to hear what I
hear; and I see more of the spirits of some men than ever I thought I should
see. The Lord rebuke Satan. Sir, be of good comfort, I doubt not but our God
that is in heaven will carry you above all the injuries of men; for I know you
would not permit any thing, much less act in any thing that might tend to
the least damage of this people, and this I am assured of, that most of Gods
people here about us are of the same mind. The rumors of the country, you
know, they rise out of ignorance principally, and much out of fears;
wherefore, I pray you, let there be satisfaction given as soon as you
convenientlie can, in the way you wrote me of; for I find the spirits of of
men in this country are too quick and forward. I cannot excuse myself, yet I
bless God, not to wrong you, but according to the information and light I
received from you, I acted publicly so far forth as to break down all
prejudices against yourselfe or the rest that advised with you. Our prayers
here are publicly and privately for a good issue of it, and that continually.
I hope God will look upon your sincerity in mercy and will hear our
requests.

I see no good use of such protestations as I hear of, but they may prove more
dangerous than the French business by far, if our God hinder not. However, it
will be of use (God directing) to make a holy use of it.

Touching my coming to Boston about the Dutch business, I cannot see how it will
be of any use: For the messenger cannot have a determinate answer till the
general court, and to morrow we have appointed many of the town for the
working of the fort, which, unless I be there, there will not any thing be
done, and I received not your letter till this day after our lecture.

I conceive, if you do any thing about Mr. Oateleys business, that you also
will be pleased to appoint some day and grant some summons to him, that he may
bring in his witnesses, that there may not be any just ground of exceptions
given: For he speaks as if he were much wronged in all the testimonies taken
against him, and that he can disprove them, etc.

Touching the note about Bushrode, I shall bring it with me (God willing) the
next court.

The Lord our good God be with you, to uphold you, and to continue you amongst
us, to do yet further service, to whose grace I committ you.

Yours ever truly to serve, Jo. Endecott.
Salem, 26. 5th mo. 1643.
The Governor's Answer to the Ipswich Letter about La Tour.
Gentlemen and beloved brethren,
IT is not unknown to you, that (through the Lords gracious assistance) I have
thankfully embraced and submitted unto the wise and loveing advise and
admonitions of any of my brethren; and truly it is still my desire so to do:
And this (I hope) may well stand (upon this present occasion) with the
maintenance of what is good and righteous in our cause, about this French
business, and with that faithfulness that is again required of me toward you
all, whom I love honor and reverence in the Lord. And though I have lately
written to you about this matter, yet that which I have since received from you
calls upon me for some addition and answer also; which I do not with any
purpose to contend, but in discharge of my conscience and duty of my place, and
let the Lord do what seems good in his eyes.

The protestation, which was directed to myself first, but came to me through
many hands (and so it seems it was intended by you, being sent unsealed) was
entertained of me as proceeding from your zealous care for the public safety:
But, considered in itself, it is an act of an exorbitant nature, out of rule,
out of season, and of dangerous consequence. Such protestations are public
and judicial acts, and therefore must be warranted by some authority, which
appears not in this. I know no law, order, custom or etc. that can give power
to 3 assistants, by any such public instrument, to contradict the proceedings
of a greater number, the Governor also being one of them; and how it will
consist with the obligation of a freeman is also considerable. Suppose now, 3
other assistants and so many elders should protest against your protestation,
it would be of equal force, and as warrantable for ought I know. Again, it
comes not like Solomon's apples of gold if plates of silver; it is consilium
post factum: Whereas, if you had sent it in season, it might perchance have
stopped those proceedings which you so much complain against; whereas, at
present (you know and may see) you do but beat the air, and strive for that
which (you are sure) you cannot reach. It is also of dangerous consequence in
these respects. 1. It may be a president for others to attempt the like in any
case; for you take upon you the sole judgment of your own act, and if others
may have the like liberty, they may countenance their opposition to authority,
as well in evil causes as in good. 2. It blows a trumpet to division and
dissension amongst ourselves, magistrates protesting against magistrates,
elders against elders, blameing, condemning, exposeing brethren to the peoples
curses, and casting them down to hell itself; and all this must be endured,
while we walk after the light God affords us from his own word, and the
presidential acts of former times, and of our own general court (as will be
expressed hereafter) whereas the way of God, and of order, and of peace, had
been to have referred your grievance to the general court, and not by such an
unwarrantable protestation and outcry against your brethren, to incite the
people against them; whereof, if any evil effect should follow, your
protestation of innocence would afford you little comfort or defense. 3. This
is the ready way to hasten upon us the evil so much feared: For if Daulnay
understand our divisions to be such, as he is like to have a party amongst
ourselves, (as you declare your intelligence to be) this may imboulden him to
attempt that against us which, otherwise, he dared not have done. It is also
against the rule of justice, your own plea on Daulnays behalf, for you pass
sentence and publish it without calling us to answer: If may be one or two of
you have accidentally heard us speak somewhat about it, but did you ever
enquire of us, if we had any more to say for our selves, why judgment etc. For
you will find we have more to say for our selves than you formerly heard, and
it is a necessary consequence, if you had power to be our judges, you had the
same to require our answer. I entreat you to call to mind that beaten rule of
equity, Qui aliquid statuit part inaudita altera, etc. We are condemned in
court, in country, by private tongues and by public edict, and never asked,
Why have you done this? and all this so carried on, and unseasonably dispensed
as no man can tell (nor do yourselves propound) what you would have, or how it
may tend to any public good or prevention of that great danger which you
suppose to hang over us; except it may be conceived that, either Daulnay will
be pacified with a protestation, or the people will be stirred up to sacrifice
some of us to make their own peace. You say, indeed, you will hereby be
innocent of all the evil that may ensue, etc. Amen, say I; but surely wise men
will not believe that such a protestation will acquit you, either before God or
men: No more than if one of the magistrates (...) court while a man is
condemned, and after he is executed shall tender a protestation of his dissent
from the sentence. And truly (brethren) you might have dealt a little more
tenderly with us, for such saileings as you have apprehended in our counsels,
being the fruit but of a few hours consultation; seeing yourselves, (upon so
many weeks deliberation) could not free your own acts from such miscarriage
as you see your protestation, out of date and out of course, does hold forth.

This I thought needful to tender to your wise and christian consideration,
concerning your protestation in general: Somewhat I must say to your
arguments, besides what may concern them in my former writings. But, first,
you may please to consider, that it cannot be denied but that the Governor,
assisted with some of the magistrates, may take order for such sudden affairs
of the state as either need not, or cannot, stay the assembling of the general
court; of which sort, we conceived this was (the reasons you may see in my
former writing) and when, in such cases, we have proceeded according to our
best skill and judgment, we are to be excused, and so it was wont to be: And
the general court seems lately to have enlarged this trust, when, by the
order of (4) 1641, it gives power, out of court, to any 3 magistrates to do
that which may occasion a war, with the Indians, as likely as this with the
French: For they may give commission to any master to right himself upon the
Indians, for his fugitive servant. By like authority it was that some of us
disarmed the Indians and imprisoned some of them, upon the late suspicion: And
although it was conceived to be full of danger, and proved troublesome and
chargeable, yet we were not reproved for it. Other instances might be brought,
but in those times, indeed, when such protestations were not in use. Now, in
this case of the French, wherein the only doubt was, not whether we should
engage ourselves in a war with La Toure against Daulney, or not; for, we know
that neither the magistrates nor the general court it self could determine
that, No War could be declared without the consent of the united Colonies*
but whether it were safer or more just and honorable for us to stop the
course of God's providence, offering us opportunity to save a distressed
neighbor, to weaken a dangerous enemy without our chardge or engagement, or to
suffer it to go on freely in its own course. Of these two we judged the last
to be best, etc. And of this opinion some of us shall still be until we see
stronger arguments against it, than as yet we have met with.

Now for your arguments, (whereof some concern the preceedings, others the
consequences) I will pass by that of Jehosaphat as no parallel to our case;
and see if I can free us from that of Prove. 26. And here it may be first
observed, that he speaks of one that passes by, viz. that had no calling or
invitation to deal in it. But 2, I will show that this strife between La Tour
and Daulnay does nearly concern us: and first in point of duty, in that our
distressed neighbor calls to us for help; a special providence of God and his
own good opinion of our charitableness, brought him to us, for some ends, and
no other appearing to us, it was our duty to attend his; nor were we in this
case to stand upon the justice of the quarrel between them, no more than
Abraham did when Lot and the Sodomites were in present distress; nor than any
man would do, if he saw his neighbor under foot and in danger to be killed,
he would first rescue him from danger, ere he enquire of the cause. And how we
might withould such help from La Tour which that providence which brought him
hither, might here offer him in his apparent distress and danger of utter
ruin, I profess I see no warrant.

For cleareing of this point I desire you seriously to consider an argument or
two. 1, He is either a neighbor or no neighbor. If he be not a neighbor,
then is he in no relation to us by the second table, and then we may rob,
beat, or kill him without breach of any commandment. But if he be a neighbor
then must we do to him in his distress, as we would have others do to us in
ours. 2dly, If he be one of those ALL, to whom by the rule of the Apostle we
must do good (as he must needs be, if he be either of the household of faith
or out of it) then that is the good we must do to him, which he has most
present need of; and that we may not withould from him, when it is in our
hands to give it him, Prove. 3.27. I pray you consider the place. 3dly, If my
neighbors or mine enemies ox be in that state as he cannot get to his place
without my help, I must help him to his place, Exodus 23.4. much rather my
neighbor himself; and therefore La Tour and his company being now before us
in that condition, we ought to help him hence. These are plain and general
rules and will not bear distinctions of protestant and papist: For the moral
law being given to man by nature was given to him as man, not as man so and so
qualifyed, and therefore when it requires duty from him, it requires it as from
a man simply; and when it propounds man as an object of this duty, it propounds
him also simply considered without distinction of good or bad, christian or
heathen, etc. and our Savior inforceth this by propounding the example of our
heavenly father, who causes the sun to shine upon the just and unjust, etc.
and commands us to follow his example. And the gospel makes this difference
only, that in question of priority, or necessity of neglect of one, the
faithful must be preferred. Therefore let us see something of like authority
to dispense with these rules, or else we must conclude, that this (so far as
we deal in it) is a thing that concerns us. 2dly, As it concerns us in point
of duty, so does it also in point of danger. I have showed in my former
writing, how Daulnay has dealt with us and our neighbors, when he was weak,
what principles he is acted by, and what pretenses he has against us; and all
histories teach us that the ambition and covetousnes of conquerours and
spoylers, has always increased with their power: And shall we not believe that
Daulnay only will be more calmed and moderated by access of 200 soldiers, and
4 or 5000 l. yearly revenue: Let the latin proverb be attended as well us the
German, and that will tell us that res nostra agitur, paries cum proximus
ardet. I may strengthen this concernment by a late German history. When the
bishop of Spiers had begun to raise a strong fortification upon his own
territories, the late Palatine of Rhine demolished it by force of arms in a
time of peace, because it might be dangerous to him if war should arise. And
the Lacedaemonians being in league with the Athenians (their own city being
unwalled) would not suffer the Athenians to wall theirs, because it concerned
them in point of advantage. And it has been usual for the States of Europe to
interpose in quarrels of their neighbor States, when they have concerned them
but in point of danger only. Now for your discourse about our distinction
between commanding and not forbidding, let the distinction be rightly stated
as it concerns our practice, and not as you would put upon us, and we hope it
will hold so well, as neither the advisers nor the actors shall need to be
ashamed to own it. We disclaim to have any hand in yielding leave to any of
ours to go make war upon Daulnay, but this we own and no more, that we gave
leave to such as could be hired, etc. to accompany La Tour and to conduct him
to his own place. And such a permission at this (though it were a commission
to this purpose) we stand still to maintain is no undertaking of war, nor act
of hostility, but a mere liberty of commerce, and if any blood shed should
follow upon it, it is accidental and not depending upon this as any cause of
it. Nor is it any just provocation of war, or any breach of peace, nor so
accounted among civil states. I shall clear it by an instance or two both
private and public. If I have a neighbor within a few miles of me suspected to
be a robber, if I send my servant to beat him and he does so, I am a
trespasser; if he kill him, I am a murderer. But if a traveller comes by and
tells me that he has a chardge about him, and he is afraid to go alone on his
journey for fear of such man, and desires me to let my servant go with him (if
he be willing) though it may be dangerous to his life, and may also prove
danger to me or mine from such robber: And if the traveller be now set upon
by this robber and my servant kills him, we may both justify it.

I will give another instance. A merchant of Spain being in London, by leave
of the King of England, hires a London ship to transport him and his goods into
Spain; upon the way, a Holland man of war meets and fights with him, and men
are slain on both sides, yet without any breach of peace on either side, or
any act of hostility in the King of England, as it would have been if he had
granted a commission to assault the Hollander: So that you may see there is a
wide difference between giveing commission to fight and giveing leave to be
hired to guard or transport. So as you must needs have been mistaken in the
right statinge of the distinction, or else I cannot conceive what your
apprehensions should be of the English and Irish and Scottish, who in so great
numbers, for these many years, have served the States against the Spaniards,
and the Spaniards against the States, the Swedes against the Emperor, and e
contra, without any breach of the peace between those nations. But, admit such
a permission were against a rule of state; yet, if that rule of state be
against the rule of charity, it will not be hard to judge which must give
place. I will conclude this argument with that which I touched in my former
writing. That which is lawful for a private person to do, in the way of his
calling, the magistrate (if he judge it expedient, or not hurtful to the
commonwealth) ought to further, or not to hinder him in it. But it is lawful for
the owners and masters of ships, and is in the way of their calling, to be
hired by La Tour, to convey him to his rightful habitation, and we judge it no
way hurtful but advantageous to this commonwealth; therefore we did well,
according to the duty of our office, in yielding leave to them, and in not
hindering them. And it is no sufficient plea against it, to say that we know
not the justice of his cause; for that will not concern us in this case (and
yet we do know it in good measure) But if our ships shall be opposed in their
lawful course, the justice of their cause will lie in that: As for example: A
man travaileing in a wagon in England, and carrying his goods with him, his
creditor sets upon the wagon to take his debtors goods from him by force, the
waggoner may defend him and his goods, being now in his charge, without any
respect to the former engagement; for the justice of his cause arises upon
another ground. Neither is there any need to send to Daulnay before they go
(no, though they went of purpose to fight with him) for besides diverse examples
in scripture to warrant the forbearance of it, the rule in Deuteronomy. 20.10. gives
other direction: When thou come near to a city to fight against it, thou
shall send to offer peace, etc. This point being thus cleared, that we have not
enterprised any war in this our proceeding, all your complaints against us,
and all your arguments tending that way do fall to the ground. This is not the
case, neither are we the men, and therefore I shall not need to examine your
reasons and allegations against such; nor am I willing to mention these
passadges wherein our power seems to be so much slighted. I dare not believe
that you intended all that is held forth in them. I look at your queries also
as raised upon the same mistaken grounds, which being now cleared to you, you
will easily resolve yourselves about them. And yet this I will propound to your
consideration, which may be a full answer to them all in the most knotty
construction, viz. If our brethren should err in their way and thereby bring
them selves into distress, yet (if we must pardon them upon their repentance)
sure we may not desert them, nor hide our eyes from their misery. If any of
our confederates (through humane infirmity) should, against their covenant,
bring a just war upon themselves, yet if they call to us for help, and
tender themselves to equal satisfaction, we must not leave them to
destruction. No relation amongst men could stand or be useful, if mere error
(which we are all continually subject to) might dissolve it, or obstruct the
vital spirit which should breathe in it.

Whereas you object that, in this permission, we make the state but a cipher: I
answer, the state has the same influence into this which it has into other
merchants voyages, by a general and implicit consent, which may be sufficient
in so free a state as ours is; where there is no restraint upon persons or
ships (but upon special occasion) they go and come at their liberty.

Now for the point of danger. I conceive, first, the rule of the Apostle Peter
will hold even in this case; while we do well we are not to be frighted with
any terror. Again, there is no course or voyage undertaken by us, but it may
expose the undertakers to peril, and may occasion displeasure and danger to us
from abroad; but such dangers have not hitherto deterred us from any probable
way of our safety or advantage; nor have we sustained any harm hitherto, by
casting ourselves upon the Lord and his good providence, in such cases. I will
remember you of some. When we first set up reformation in our church way, did
not this expose us to as great an hazard as we could run, both from abroad and
at home? Did not our friends in England, many of them, forewarne us of it ere
we came away? Did not others send letters after us, to deter us from it? Did
not some among ourselves (and those no mean ones) inculcate our inevitable
dangers at home, from no small company left out of church fellowship, and
civil offices, and freedom hitherto? Yet we trusted in God (though there
appeared no means of safety) and went on our way; and the Lord has still
preserved us and frustrated all counsels and attempts against us. Again, when
upon grievous complaints against us to the Lords of the Privy Counsel, of such
civil innovations amongst us as we could not justify by the laws of that state,
a strict order and command was sent to us to deliver up our patent, or else to
expect to have it fetched by force, what greater danger could be toward us
than appeared in not obeying of this command? Yet we had then courage enough to
return an answer without our patent. When we undertook a war against the
Pequots, which no necessity put us upon, but only in point of conscience (they
had done us no injury) on others behalf, there were more objections (in point
of dangerous consequences) against that, than against this; our friends of
Plymouth complained of it, and wrote to us accordingly; so did our friends of
Connecticot, laying forth the dangers we had exposed them unto by it, wishing
we had forborne to a fitter season; but neither of them protesting against it:
Yet, in due time, the Lords hand appeared in it, to the good of the whole
country, and we felt but little of those great dangers which were justly to be
feared. Our intelligence was believed, which we heard long since, and has been
more certainly confirmed of late, that the jesuitical State They were in great
fear of the French when they settled, under Richlieu, at Port Royal and
afterward, when D'Aulnay came to Penobscot. See Massa. History, V. I. p. 28.
have had an evil eye upon us, and not without cause (as themselves apprehend)
and though we look at this as the head of all foreign enmity, yet the Lord
has still saved us, and that without any great impression of fear upon our
spirits. In the treaty about our confederacy, the doubtful construction of it
in England, the danger from a General Governor (especially in regard of our
brethren of Plymouth) the necessity of our being involved in the quarrel with
the Dutch, on the behalf of our brethren of Hartford, were taken notice of by
the general court and many of the elders, etc. yet neither would the court be
deterred from entering into that brotherly league, nor were our elders or people
troubled with fear of those dangers. And now, lately, when we received Pumham
and Sawconoco in to our jurisdiction, the general court considered how
offensive it would be to the Naragansets, and so likely to engage us in a war
with them; yet, the thing being lawful and expedient for us, and giving hope of
opening a door to the conversion of some of them, they would not let slipp the
opportunity of such advantages, for the fear of doubtful dangers. More I might
add: All amounts to this sum, the Lord has brought us hither, through the
swelling seas, through perils of pirates, tempests, leakes, fires, rocks,
sands, diseases, starvings, and has here preserved us these many years from
the displeasure of Princes, the envy and rage of Prelates, the malignant plots
of Jesuits, the mutinous contentions of discontented persons, the open and
secret attempts of barbarous Indians, the seditious and undermineing practices
of heretical false brethren; and is our confidence and courage all swallowed
up in the fear of one D'aulnay? Admit we should have stepped aside out of our
way, does the favor and protection of our God wholely depend upon our perfect
walking? Were we never out of our way before, under all our former mercies and
deliverances? Did Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Jehosaphat, the people of
Israel, Judas, and others, never find protection and deliverance, when, by
infirmity, they were found to be out of their way? If they did, why may not we
still seek and hope for the like, seeing the Lords mercies endure for ever?
For my part (if there were not other sins, which God may have a controversy
with us for) I should little fear any harm from this. If any breach were made
in our peace, this is not the way to make it up. We may bring more displeasure
and danger upon ourselves, by the divisions and breaches of rule which may be
occasioned by our unseasonable striveings about that which is now past remedy,
than would otherwise arise from any miscarriage in the business it self, in the
worst construction that can be made thereof.

The fear of man brings a snare; but he that trusts in the Lord shall be
safe. Prove. 29.24.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Simon Bradstreet to Governor Winthrop.
Right worthy Sir,
I Received, together with others, two letters from your self, concerning the
French affair, and had I not hoped that you should have received a final
answer from us long before this time, I should not have been so long silent,
nor showed so much seeming neglect, but being now almost out of hope of
accomplishing that which was intended, I thought meet to present you with
these few lines. How unpleasing it was to me for to express my self by word
or writeing contrary to the apprehension of your self and other friends, both
godly and wise, whom I both love and honor, he that is the searcher of
hearts knows; and how far it was from my will or intent, when I set my
hand to that letter you received, to cast any dishonor upon your self or
others, I hope in time you shall know and be fully persuaded of. The truth is,
our ayding of Latour was very grievous to many hereabouts, the design being
feared to be unwarrantable by dyvers, as the case stands with us; of which
number I confess I was, and so still remain one, and though the business was
so far proceeded in before we writ the letter, as (for my part) I had noe
hope of stayeing the ships, yet some of us thought it might be of good use to
intimate that some cautions might be given to those that went, and they be
strictly required to observe the same, that so the undertaking might be
preserved from sin and the common wealth from damage, so much as the case
was capable of, which cautions if refused, then to signify under our hands,
our not consenting to the proceeding, with our reasons thereof; but for any
protestation against the act, condemning it, we never intended it, but
frequently fully and expressly declined it, so the sending the letter without
those cautions and after the ships were gone, concerns those to answer that
did it, for my part I was much troubled at it so soon as I heard of it. What
errors may be found in our letter for matter or manner of expression (it being
intended noe otherwise than I have expressed) I shall be far from owneing or
justifyeing when they shall appear; this I can truly say, we were
sollicitously careful (according to the little time we had) not to write any
thing that might be matter of just offense, and I hope a favorable
interpretation of words (our intention being rightly understoode) may free it
from blame. Concerneing the arguments you allege to warrant the design, I
shall forbear saying any thing at present, not having either of your letters
by me, but rather leave them to be answered by the elders, who it is likely
will shortly visit you upon other accounts, and for my self I hope to wait
upon you at the court, when we may have opportunity to speak further about
the same; and for those many heavy imputations, which your last letter charge
us with, being chiefly grounded upon the time and manner of sending our letter
(of which I had noe knowledge) I hope you will see cause to excuse me of, as
noe ways discerning the same, so humbly praying the God of love and peace to
preserve us in peace and unity, and this whole plantation from ways of sin and
provocation, I remain

your worships unfeynedly to love and fear you in the Lord, Simon Bradstreet.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Endecott to Governor Winthrop, about the
Misdemeanors of Griffin's Company at Gloucester.
Dearest Sir,
I Heard nothing further of Gloucester business till the 3d day of this week at
even, when I received a letter from Mr. Blinman, together with a complaint of
the town against Griffens company for several misdemeanors. And at the foot
of the complaint a referrence from yourselfe and 3 other magistrates to me, for
the redress of them. I therefore dispatched away a messenger betimes the next
morning, with a letter to Mr. Griffen, that he would send me such of his men
whose names I had underwritten his letter, to answer to the misdemeanors of
sabbath-breaking, swearing and drunkenness: And withal I sent a letter with
instructions to Mr. Blinman, with a warrant addressed to the constable. That if
Mr. Griffen would not send his men, that the constable should attach their
persons and bring them before me: If they did resist or refuse, not to strive
with them nor to use any provoking terms, but to take witness of their
carriadge and to return me an answer; which here I have sent you enclosed. I
would have proceeded against them according to your former directions (to wit)
with force; but I had rather, if you see good, try first another way, which
is, to send a prohibition, under your and diverse of the magistrates hands
besides, forbidding Mr. Steephens and the rest of the ship-carpenters there, or
any where within this jurisdiction, upon some penalty, not to work a stroke
of work more upon Mr. Griffens ship till they had further order from the
Governor, etc. I desire therefore to hear from you what you would have done.
In the mean time, I have written away another letter to Mr. Griffen, wishing
him to counsel his men (if he cannot command them) to submitt to authority,
seeing they stand out to their own loss and disadvantage. What his return
will be you shall hear as soon as I can send it.

I pray you, good Sir, let me be excused from coming to this court, for I am
not fitted for winter journeys, and for such bad ways as we must pass.

I want much to hear of your sons iron and steel. If the country will not
be encouraged by so useful a design, to enlardge themselves for the advantage
of it, I know not what will.

The Lord our good God in mercy keep you and yours, to whose grace I committ
you and rest

Yours truly and unfeignedly, Jo. Endecott.
Salem, 1. 10 mo. 1643. I am glad to hear of your son Mr. Steevens safe
return, togeher with his beloved. I desire to be kindly remembered to them both.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Endecott to Governor Winthrop.
Dearest Sir,
I must needs acknowledge I was somewhat grieved when I heard of Haddock's
cariadge to yourselfe, and Mr. Pains staying aboard that they could not be
commanded ashore upon any occasion. I thought then of Castle Island that it
would be of good use to control such fellows: But to be any strength to your
town or country I cannot see it. I veriely think that the country will be
very willing that there may be a fort there, built at the chardges of the
towns thereabouts: And to understand their willingness or consent to it, I
think it may be done by what is propounded, viz. to send to the magistrates and
deputies, or, if you see good, to the magistrates and deputies of the several
shires, who may easily come together without any chardge to the country. We
have, here in Essex, appointed a day to meet at Salem, viz. the 22d of the next
month, to consider of some thing for the common wealth, according to an order
of court. Now then I think it will be soon enough to send in our counsel or
consent therein, seeing little can be done to the work in the mean time.

I hear you have great sights upon the water seen between the castle and the
town; men walking on the water in the night ever since the ship was blown
up, or fire in the shape of men. There are very few do believe it, yet here
is a great report of it brought from thence the last day of the week.

The maid Mr. Endecott's daughter, this being the language of the day.
is now going along with us to Orchard, His farm 3 or 4 miles from Salem.
where your son shall be heartily welcome.

I am glad that the Mohawks news is false. The Lord continue peace unto us if
it be his blessed will, to whose grace I committ you, and ever rest your
assured loving

friend and servant, Jo. Endecott.

Copy of a Letter from Sir William Berkeley, Governor of Virginia, to the
Governor of New England, about Mr. Chew's Servants.
Worthy Sir,
HAving received intelligence and complaint from Mr. John Chew, merchant, that
certain of his servants being run away about May 1643, and are now resident in
your collony of New England, I desire you will please to assist this Gentleman,
the bearer, in the regaining of them by all possible means that may be, it
being but an accustomed favor reciprocally shown upon all occasions, either to
other, in which at noe time we shall be defective as we expect the like from
you; he has made it appear in court they are his servants; their names are
Walter Joy, William Woodhead, and Henry King, alias Any, so not doubting of
your assistance herein I rest,

Your servant, William Berkely.

Copy of a Letter from Sir Henry Vane Mr. Winthrop had obliged Mr. Vane to
leave the Massachusetts and return to England. This letter was wrote when Mr.
Vane's interest in Parliament was very great. It shows a good spirit and the
reproof is decent as well as seasonable.
to Governor Winthrop.
Honored Sir,
I Received yours by your son, and was unwilling to let him return without
telling you as much. The exercise and troubles which God is pleased to lay upon
these kingdoms and the inhabitants in them, teaches us patience and
forbearance one with another in some measure, though there be difference in our
opinions, which makes me hope that, from the experience here, it may also be
derived to yourselves, least while the congregationall way amongst you is in
its freedom, and is backed with power, it teach its oppugners here to extirpate
it and root it out, from its own principles and practice. I shall need say
noe more knowing your son can acquaint you particularly with our affairs.

Sir I am Your affectionate friend, and servant in Christ, H. Vane.
June 10. 1645. Pray commend me kindly to your wife, Mr. Cotton and his wife,
and the rest of my friends with you.



A Declaration of former Passages and Proceedings betwixt the English and the
Narrowgansetts, with their Confederats, wherein the Grounds and Justice of the
ensueing War are opened and cleared.
Published Made public, I never met with it in print.
by Order of the Commissioners of the United Colonies at Boston, the 11th of
the 6th Month, 1645.
THE most considerable part of the English colonies profess they came into
these parts of the world with desire to advance the kingdom of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and to enjoy his precious ordinances with peace; and (to his praise
they confess) he has not failed their expectation hitherto, they have found
safety, warmth and refreshing under his wings, to the satisfaction of their
souls. But they know and have considered that their Lord and Master is King
of righteousness and peace, that he gives answerable laws, and casts his
subjects into such a mould and frame, that (in their weak measure) they may
hold forth his virtues in their course and carriage, not only with the
nations of Europe, but with the barbarous natives of this wilderness. And
accordingly, both in their treaties and converse, they have had an awful
respect to divine rules, endeavoring to walk uprightly and inoffensively, and
in the midst of many injuries and insolences, to exercise much patience and
long suffrance toward them.

The Pequotts grew to an excess of violence and outrage, and proudly turned
aside from all ways of justice and peace, before the sword was drawn or any
hostile attempts made against them. During those wars, and after the Pequotts
were subdued, the English colonies were careful to continue and establish
peace with the rest of the Indians, both for the present and for posterity, as
by several treatyes with the Narrowganset and Mohiggin Sagamores may appear.
Which treaties, for a while, were in some good measure duly observed by all
the Indians; but, of late, the Narrowgansets, and especially the Nyanticks
their confederats, have many ways injuriously broken and violated the same,
by intertaineing and keeping amongst them, not only many of the Pequot nation,
but such of them as have had their hands in the blood and murder of the
English, seizing and possessing at least a part of the Pequot country; which,
by right of conquest, appertains to the English; by allowing or harboring and
withhoulding several Pequot captives fled from the English, and making proud
and insolent returns when they were redemanded. And, more lately, the English
had many strong and concurrent Indian testimonies from Long Island, Uncoway,
Hartford, Kinnibeck, and other parts, of Miantonimoes ambitious designs,
traveling through all the plantations of the neighboring Indians, and, by
promises and gifts, laboring to make himself their universal Sagamore or
commander, persuadeing and engageing them, at once, to cut off the whole body
of the English in those parts. Which treacherous plotts were confirmed by the
Indians general preparations in messages, insolences and outrages against the
English and such Indians as were subjects or friends to them; so that the
English colonies, to their great charge and damage, were forced to arm, to
keep strong watch, day and night, and some of them to travel with convoyes
from one plantation to another, and when Miantonimo, in his circular travel,
was questioned at Newhaven concerneing these things, instead of other and
better satisfaction, he threatened to cut off any Indians head that should lay
such a charge upon him to his face.

The commissioners, by the premises, observed Miantonimoes proud and
treacherous disposition, yet thought not fit to proceed against him in that
respect, till they had collected more legal and convinceing proose.

But while these things were under deliberation, Miantonimo was brought
prisoner by Uncas to Hartford, and the case being opened and cleared as
follows, he craved the commissioners advise how to proceed with him.

It appeared that in a treaty made with the English, at the Massachusetts Anno
1637, Miantonimo engaged himself not to fight with any of the Indians, and
particularly not to invade Uncas without the English consent; and after in a
tripartite agreement made and concluded at Hartford betwixt Miantonimo and
Uncas with reference to the English, Anno 1638, in which one of the articles
runns, That though either of the said Indian Sagamores should receive injury
from the other, yet neither of them shall make or begin war, until they had
appealed to the English, and till their grievances were first heard and
determined, and if either of them should refuse, the English might assist
against, and compel the refuseing and obstinate party.

Notwithstanding which, Miantonimo and his confederates have both forcibly and
openly plotted and practiced against the life of Uncas not at all acquainting
the English or advising with them; but more especially of late, since the
forementioned plotts and designs were in hand.

First, a Pequott Indian, one of Uncas his subjects, in the spring 1643, aiming
at Uncas life, shot him with an arrow through the arm, and presently fled to
the Narrowgansetts or their confederates, boasting in the Indian plantations
that he had killed Uncas. But when it was known that Uncas (though wounded) was
alive, the Pequot (taught as was supposed) changed his note, affirming that
Uncas had cut through his own arm with a flint, and had hired him to say he
had shot and killed him.

Miantonimo, being sent for by the governor of the Massachusetts upon another
occasion, brought this Pequott with him and would have covered him with the
former disguise, but when the English, out of his own mouth, found him guilty
and would have sent him to Uncas his Sagamore, Miantonimo earnestly desired he
might not be taken out of his hands, promising he would send him safe to Uncas
to be examined and punished.

But feareing (as it seems) his own treachery would be discovered in a day or
twoe, he stopped the Pequotts mouth by cutting off his head; but at parting he
told the governor in discontent that he would come no more to Boston.

After this some attempts were made (as is reported) to take away Uncas life by
poison, and by forcery; these faileing, some of Sequassons company (an Indian
Sagamore allied unto and an intimate confederate with Miantonimo) shot at
Uncas, with an arrow or two, as he was goeing down Connecticut river.

Uncas, according to the forementioned treaty (1638) complained, and the
English, by mediation, sought to make peace, but Sequasson expressing his
dependence on Miantonimo refused, and chose war. They fought and Uncas had
the victory.

Lastly, Miantonimo, without any provocation from Uncas (unless the
disappointment of former plotts provoked) and suddenly, without denouncing
war, came upon the Moheggins with 900 or 1000 men, when Uncas had not half
so many to defend himself. Uncas, before the battle, told Miantonimo that he
had many ways sought his life, and for the sparing of blood offered by a
single combat betwixt themselves to end the quarrel. But Miantonimo presuming
upon his number of men, would have nothing but a battle. The issue fell
contrary to expectation, his men were routed, diverse of considerable note
slain, and himself taken prisoner.

These things being duly weighed, the commissioners judged that Uncas could
not be safe while Miantonimo lived: Wherefore, they thought he might justly put
such a treacherous and blood-thirsty enemy to death; but advised him to do it
in his own jurisdiction, without torture or cruelty. The best that can be said
of this advice is, that it was politic. Miantonimo was a man of great spirit.
The English were in more fear of him than of any other Indian upon the
continent.


And Uncas, having hitherto showed himself a friend to the English, and in
this and former outrages (according to the treaty) craveing their advise, if
the Narrowgansetts or their confederates should, for his just execution,
unjustly assault him, the commissioners for the colonies promised to assist and
protect him.

Uncas hereupon slew an ennemie, but not the enmity against him. The
Narrowgansetts soon fell to new contrivements. They pretended they had paid a
ransom for their Sachems life, and gave in particulars to the value of about
forty pounds. This, for a while, call an imputation of foul and unjust
dealing upon Uncas: But, in September 1644, the English commissioners, meeting
at Hartford, sent for the Narrowgansett Sachems, or their deputies, desireing
they might be instructed to make good their charge.

Uncas came himself; they sent their deputies. But after due examination it
appeared, though some loose discourse had passed that, for such quantities of
waompum and such parcells of other goods, to a great value, there might have
been some probability of spareing his life, yet no such parcells were brought,
and the Narrowgansett deputies did not allege, much less prove, that any
ransom was agreed, nor so much as any serious treaty begun to redeem their
imprisoned Sachem; and as for the waompum and goods sent, as they were but
small parcells, and scarce considerable for such a purpose, so they were
disposed of by Miantonimo himself, to sundry persons, for courtesies received
during his imprisonment, and upon hope of further favor.

The Narrowgansett deputies saw their proofs fell far short of former
pretenses, and were silent. The commissioners promised that, upon better
evidence hereafter, they should have due satisfaction.

Whereupon a truce was made, and both parties were engaged that all hostility
should cease till planting time 1645, and after that they would give thirty
days warning either at the Massachusetts or Hartford before the truce should
cease. Yet in February last, the Narrowgansetts by messengers sent to Boston,
declared that unless Uncas would render 160 fadom of waompum, or come to a new
heareing within six weeks they would begin the war.

This crossed the former agreement, and the season was such that neither the
commissioners could be advised with, nor could Uncas travel if notice had been
given. After which about or before planting time Tantaqueison a Mohegin
captain who took Miantonimo prisoner was dangerously and treacherously
wounded, at night, as he slept in his wigwam, and other hostile arts were on
both parts attempted in a private and underhand way, as they could take
advantage one against the other.

But since the Narrowgansetts have at several times openly invaded Uncas so
that Connecticut and New Haven were forced, according to engagement, to send
men from those colonies for his present defense, but with express direction
not to begin any offensive war against the Narrowgansetts or their
confederates till further order.

In the mean time, messengers were sent to the Narrowgansetts from the general
court in the Massachusetts signifyeing the commissioners meeteing, promising
their grievances should be fully and justly heard; and requiring a cessation of
war in the mean time, but they refused; and heareing, probably, that the
English from the Western colonies were returned, they made a new assault upon
Uncas, and have done him much hurt.

The commissioners being met sent messengers, the second time, both to the
Narrowgansetts and Moheggin Indians, minding them of the former treaty and
truce, desiring them to send their deputies instructed and furnished with
authority to declare and open the grounds of the war, to give and receive due
satisfaction, and to restore and settle peace.

At first, the Narrowgansett Sachem gave a reasonable fair answer, that he
would send guides with them to the Moheggins, and if Uncas permitted he would
send his deputies to the commissioners, and, during eight days, hostility
should cease; but he soon repented of his moderation, told the English
messengers his mind was changed, sent private instructions to the Nyantick
Sachem, after the delivery of which there was nothing but proud and insolent
passages; the Indian guides which the English messengers brought with them from
Pumham and Soconoco, were by frowns and threatening speeches discouraged, and
returned; no other guides could be obtained, though much pressed; they knew (as
they expressed themselves) by the course held at Hartford the last year, that
the commissioners would mediate and press for peace, but they were resolved to
have no peace without Uncas his head, it mattered not who began the war, they
were resolved to continue it; the English should withdraw their garrison from
Uncas, or they would take it as a breach of former covenants, and would procure
as many Moquakes Maquas or Mohawks.
as the English should affront them with; that they would lay the English
cattle on heaps as high as their houses; that no English man should stepp out
of his house to piss, but he should be killed.

They reviled Uncas, charged him with cutting through his own arm, and saying
the Narrowgansetts had shot him; affirmed, that he would now murder the
English messengers, as they went or returned, (if he had opportunity) and lay
it upon the Narrowgansetts.

The English messengers, upon this rude and uncivil usage, wanting guides to
proceed, and fearing danger, returned to the Narrowgansetts, acquainted Pesicus
with the former passages, and desired guides from him, he (in scorn, as they
apprehended it) offered them an old Pequot squawe, but would afford no other
guides. There also they conceived themselves to be in danger, three Indians
with hatchets standing behind the interpreter in a suspicious manner, whilst he
was speaking with Pesicus, and the rest frowneing and expressing much distemper
in their countenance and carriage. The English messengers, not hopeing for
better success at that time, departed; telling Pesicus, that if he would
return any other answer, he should send it to the English tradeing house,
where they intended to lodge that night. In the morning, he invited them to
return, and promised them a guide to Uncas, but would grant no cessation of
arms. When they came to Providence, they understood that, in their absence, a
Narrowgansett Indian had been there, and faineing himself to be of
Connecticot, spoke in that dialect, but could not put off the Narrowgansett
tone. He told Benedict Arnolds wife (who well understands the Indian language)
that the English messengers should not pass to the Moheggins; he knew they
should have no guides, but should be destroyed in the woods, as they traveled
toward Uncas.

Thus the English messengers returned, and the interpreter, under his hand and
upon his oath, related the former passages, with others less material, more
largely.

Mr. Williams, by the messengers, wrote to the commissioners, assureing them
that the country would suddenly be all on fire, meaneing by war; that, by
strong reasons and arguments, he could convince any man thereof that was of
another mind; that the Narrowgansetts had been with the plantations combined
with Providence and had solemnly treated and settled a neutrality with them,
which fully shows their counsels and resolutions for war.

Thus while the commissioners, in care of the public peace, sought to quench
the fire kindled amongst the Indians, these children of strife breath out
threatenings, provocations and war against the English themselves. So that
unles they should dishonor and provoke God, by violating a just engagement, and
expose the colonies to contempt and danger from the Barbarians, they cannot but
exercise force, when no other means will prevail, to reduce the
Narrowgansetts and their confederates to a more just and sober temper.

The eyes of other Indians, under the protection of the Massachusetts and not
at all engaged in this quarrel, are (as they have expressed themselves to the
English messengers) fastened upon the English with strict observation, in what
manner and measure they provide for Uncas safety. If he perish, they will
charge it upon them, who might have preserved him; and no Indians will trust
the English, if they now break engagement, either in the present or succeeding
generations. If Uncas be ruined in such a cause, they foresee their heads,
upon the next pretense, shall be delivered to the will of the Narrowgansetts,
with whom therefore they shall be forced to comply as they may, for their
future safety, and the English may not trust an Indian in the whole country.
The premises being duly weighed, it clearly appears that God calls the
colonists to a war.

The Naragansetts and their confederates rest on their numbers, weapons and
opportunities to do mischief, and probably as of old, Ashur, Amalek, and the
Philistines, with others, did confederate against Israel, so Satan may stir
upp and combine many of his instruments against the churches of Christ: But
their Redeemer is the Lord of Hoastes, the mighty one in battle, all the
shieldes of the earth are in his hands, he can save by few or by weak means,
as well as by many and great. In him they trust.

Commission and Instructions from the Commissioners of the united Colonies to
Maj. Gibbons.
THE Commissioners of the united colonies of New England being to appoint a
commander in chief, over all such military forces as are to be sent forth and
employed, not only in aid of the Moheggin sachem, but also against the
Narrowgansett and Nianticks and other their confederates, who in making war
upon Uncas the Moheggin sachem contrary to former treaties and agreements, are
now become as well our enemies as his in regard of our engagement. The said
commissioners having sufficient knowledge of the piety, courage, skill and
discretion of you Major Edward Gibbones, do hereby committ unto you the
charge, conduct, command and government of all the said military forces, with
all such arms, and ammunition, provisions and other appurtenances, with all
officers thereto appointed, to be ordered managed and disposed of upon all
occasions by yourselfe and your council of war, according to the course of
military discipline, and according to such instructions as you shall receive
from the said commissioners from the time of your setting forth in your march
until your return, or sufficient discharge sent you from the same authority.
You have power also hereby (with advise of your council of war) to use and
execute martial discipline upon all offenders and delinquents as occasion
shall be, by fynes, corporal punishment, and capital punishments also if need
shall require. And all persons whatsoever employed under you in this service,
are hereby required to yield due obedience and subjection to all your lawful
commands, according to the quality and power wherewith you are hereby invested.
You have also power to command and order all such barks and other vessels
which are to be set forth in the said service, with all seamen, soldiers,
ammunition and provisions in them. And the said commissioners do hereby
constitute and appoint Capt. Miles Standish, Capt. John Mason, Capt. John
Leverett, Lieut. Robert Seely (or such other as shall have chief command of
the forces coming from New Haven) Lieut. Humphry Atherton, and the rest of the
Lieutenants under your command, to be your council of war, whereof yourselfe
to be president, and to have a casting voice; and you and your said council or
the greater number thereof, shall have power from time to time, as a council
of war, to manage all affairs concerning the same, and to join to you any
other discreet and able officer or officers to be of your said council, as you
see meet. You have also power hereby, upon any necessary occasion, to make new
officers and to give them titles suitable to their places.

Given under the hands of the said Commissioners at Boston in the
Massachusetts, this 19th (6th) 1645.
Instructions for Sergeant Major Gibbones, commander in chief of our military
forces, and for such as are joined unto him in a council of war.
WHEREAS you Sergeant Major Edward Gibbones are appointed commander in chief
of all such forces as are or shall be sent forth of the several colonies, as
by your commission bearinge the date of these presents does more fully appear,
and whereas there is joined to you by the same authority, as a council of
war, diverse of your chief officers, persons of approved worth and fidelity,
as in the said commission they are more fully expressed: And whereas the cause
and scope of this expedition is not only to aid the Moheggins, but to offend
and invade the Narrowgansetts, Nyanticks, and other their confederates, who,
upon making war upon Uncas the Moheggin Sachem, contrary to their
engagements, are become as well our enemies as his: Yet it being the earnest
desire of the commissioners, if it may be obtained with justice, honor and
safety, to procure peace, rather than to prosecute war; it is first commended
to your good discretions to take any fit occasion, or (if with safety you may
without any considerable delay or danger to your proceedings) to use means to
draw on such a peace, which you have hereby power to treat and conclude,
wherein you are to take due consideration of the charges the colonies have
expended in the war, which you may estimate by the numbers of men sent forth
at several times, by their continuance abroad, with wages and provisions
appertaineing. And of the damage which Uncas has sustained since the war
began, wherein it were meet (if it may be done with convenience) he were
consulted with, that both the colonies and he may receive just satisfaction and
repair; which if the Narrowgansetts cannot presently make, a considerable part
may be paid in hand, and the rest by a yearly tribute; but withal, according
to our engagements, you are to provide for Uncas his future safety, that his
plantations be not invaded, that his men and squawes may attend their planting,
fishing and other occasions, without fear or injury; and that Osswomekin,
Pumham, Soconoco, Cutchamekin, and other Indians, friends or subjects to the
English, be not molested, which will disturb the peace and draw on further
charge and inconvenience. But a peace well framed will hardly be secured,
unless either some of the chief Sachems deliver their soones as hostages, or
that some considerable part of their country be yielded to the English for
plantations, wherein there may be forts built by the English and maintained (at
least in part) by a tribute from the Narrowgansetts, to secure the agreement.
And it might probably conduce to the settling or preserving of peace, if a
trade were settled betwixt the colonies and them; by which they might be
supplied with necessaries, but pieces and powder kept back, which other
traders furnish them with. If you cannot conclude a peace with them, upon the
terms above mentioned (to prevent greater inconvenience) you may abate
somewhat of our charges, and of the damage Uncas has sustained: But much care
must be taken to secure both our and his future peace, which, if it may be done
by raising forts and keeping garrisons in the Narrowgansett and Nyantick
countries, at their charge, though we require hostages as above, they may be
restored when the fortifications are finished and their payments made; and the
articles are to be agreed and confirmed by the commissioners for the united
colonies at their next meeting, otherwise to be of no force. But if peace may
not be obtained in such a way as is before expressed, you are then with all
prudent celerity to prosecute with force of arms the said Narrowgansetts and
Nyanticks, and all such as shall assist them, until you may (through the Lords
assistance) have subdued them or brought them to reason. And if the necessity
of the service shall require a further aid of men or provisions (be it one
hundred, more or less) upon your letters of advise to the Governors of the
several colonies, supplies shall be speedily sent to you, according to the
proportion agreed.

You are to make fair wars, without exercising cruelty, and not to put to
death such as you shall take captive, if you can bestow them without danger of
your own. You are to use your best endeavors to gain the enemies canowes, or
utterly to destroy them, and herein you may make good use of the Indians our
confederates, as you may do upon other occasions, having due regard to the
honor of God, who is both our sword and shield, and to the distance which is
to be observed betwixt Christians and Barbarians, It seems strange that men who
professed to believe that God has made of one blood all nations of men for to
dwell on all the face of the earth, should so early and upon every occasion,
take care to preserve this distinction. Perhaps nothing has more effectually
defeated the endeavors for christianizing the Indians. It seems to have done
more: To have sunk their spirits, led them to intemperance, and extirpated the
whole race.
as well in wars as in other negociations. If you find any English
stragglers, traders or others, whom you shall suspect to give intelligence or
to furnish with arms and ammunition, or to give any other aid to the enemy,
you may secure them and send them to Boston. All other of our countrymen,
carrying themselves peaceably and inoffensively, shall be in peace by you, and
if you have occasion to make use of any of their boats or vessels, cattle,
provision or other goods, you shall be very tender of endamaging them, and you
shall give them a ticket whereby they may receive due satisfaction from the
colonies, or some of them.

When you shall meet with the forces which come from the confederates of
Plymouth, Connecticot and New Haven, or any of them, yourselfe and the council
may order and dispose of them, into such bodies and under such of the
commanders as you shall find to be most convenient, and most agreeable to the
service, having care to give no just occasion of offense or discontent to any
of the commanders or officers of any of the colonies.

We doubt not but yourselfe and your council knowing well how precious the
lives and healths of our men are among all our colonies, and how great charge
this war is like to bring upon us, will be very careful in preserving and
husbanding both to the best advantage; so as we shall not need to give you any
instructions and directions about the same, but shall rest satisfied in the
confidence we have of your wisdom and faithfulness to be improved, through the
Lords assistance and blessing upon you, in this service, for his own glory and
his peoples safety and prosperity in this wilderness.

If the enemy fly, so that you cannot come to fight with him, it may be
expedient that you build one or more fortifications in the most convenient
places of the Narrowganset or Nyantick countries, into which you may by the
help of the Indians our friends, gather and preserve the enemies corn and
other goods for the advantage of the service.

Lastly, (yet above all the rest) we commend to your christian care the
upholding of the worship of God in your army, and to keep such watch over the
conversation of all those under your charge, as all profaneness, impiety,
abuse of the sacred name of God, luxury, and other disorders may he avoided or
duly punished, that the Lord may be pleased to go forth before you, and
prosper all your proceedings and return you to us in peace, which we shall
daily pray for.

Boston the 19th (6) 1645.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Winslow to Governor Winthrop.
Honored Sir,
YOURS I long since received in answer of my request in behalf of my friend Mr.
Sherley and thank you for your readiness herein. Sir, I had written to you long
since, but the truth is I could neither have content in silence or writing, by
reason of some unworthy passages in our last general court, to the great
offense of our Governor Mr. Prence, myself, and sundry others. In the middle
of October we had two courts successively, the first being the last session of
our election court, the other our ordinary quarter court, and both general
courts. Before either of these two, at a court of assistants, other things
giving opportunity, the Governor, Mr. Collier, Capt. Standish, and myself
being there, took into consideration a matter of great concernment, as we
apprehended, and agreed mutually in the thing as necessary to propound it to
the general court, which was the last session of our election court:
Accordingly it was propounded, and after a whole days agitation it was allowed
and entered in the waste book, there being but one deputy against it, and he
not direct; save only, as he thought, it did not properly concern that court.
The next week, being in course another of our general courts, came more of
our magistrates that live remote and were not with us either at the court of
assistants or the foregoing general court, where this act was done; And after
a tumultuous manner excepted against the entry of that order, as pernicious and
destructive to the weal of the government, with very many unseemly terms
concerning others, etc. which exception of his was strengthened by 3 other
magistrates, one whereof had joined with us twice before and now against his
own act, bat made beforehand by the first excepter as well as the other two and
many of the deputies: They cried out to have it defaced and crossed. The
Governor Mr. Prence, and myself, would not allow it, or any other act, (Mr.
Collier being absent to our grief) to be defaced; but if hereafter it should
be found prejudicial, it might be repealed by another act, but not otherwise.
In brief (for I am ashamed to mention particulars, especially to write them) a
promise was made that it should rest till the next general court and nothing
be done in it: And then, when court and country had duly thought of it, if they
thought meet to repeal it they might. After this, the first excepter having
been observed to tender the view of a scroule from man to man, it came at
length to be tendered to my self, and withal, said he, it may be you will not
like this. Having read it, I told him I utterly abhorred it as such as would
make us odious to all christian commonweales: But at length he told the
Governor he had a written proposition to be propounded to the court, which he
desired the court to take into consideration, and according to order, if
thought meet, to be allowed: To this the deputies were most made beforehand,
and the other three assistants, who applauded it as their Diana; and the sum of
it was, To allow and maintain full and free tollerance of religion to all men
that would preserve the civil peace and submit unto government; and there was
no limitation or exception against Turk, Jew, Papist, Arian, Socinian,
Nicholaytan, Familist, or any other etc. But our Governor and diverse of us
having expressed the sad consequences would follow, especially myself and Mr.
Prence, yet notwithstanding it was required, according to order, to be voted:
But the Governor would not suffer it to come to vote, as being that indeed
would eat out the power of godliness, etc.

By this you may see that all the troubles of N. E. are not at the
Massachusetts. The Lord in mercy look upon us, and allay this spirit of
division that is creeping in amongst us. You would have admired to have seen
how sweet this carrion relished to the palate of most of the deputies! What
will be the issue of these things our all-ordering God only knows. Only we
know, without him it shall never be; and that's our greatest comfort: But if he
have such a judgment for this place, I trust, we shall find (I speak for many
of us that groan under these things) a resting place amongst you for the
soales of our feet.

I had not thought to have been so long; but if you have heard of the
particulars and the persons, especially the ringleader of this rout (if a rout
might be in a lawful assembly) by this general you may gather the more
insight into the particulars. Thus, saluting you and all yours, desireing my
due respects may be tendered to your Governor, Mr. Endecott, Mr. Pelham, Mr.
Bellingham, Mr. Saltonstall, Mr. Nowell, Mr. Hibbins, and Mr. Flint, desireing
your prayers, take leave and remain,

Your ever loveing friend, Edw. Winslow.
24 (9th) 1645.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. James Parker I suppose he was afterward one of the
Ministers of Newbury.
at Barbados, to Governor Winthrop.
Right Worshipful,
I Cannot but out of that respect I owe your self present my respects to you
in these few lines, and to give you to understand how things are here with us;
we got well to this island of Barbados through grace; here I found great
respect since my coming both from the government and people, only sorry I have
been to hear told me by the governor off this place what our reverend Mr.
Dudley should publicly say concerning him. The man seems to me to be wise,
moderate in his way and temperate, orthodox in his judgment, and I hope godly,
his natural temper is affable and not violente; this take from me as from one
that will declare the truth, he would nourish and honor religion according to
his light, only heresies (which this island abounds withal) he exposes. A
kind respective friend he has been to me, he says he desires correspondencie
with you off New England, and many able to come hither, as by my letters may
appear; I may be mistaken, but love thinks noe ill and yet not blind.

I am here engaged to preach only for the present, the manner how I refer you
to Mr. Wilson, to whom I have wrote and Mr. Cotton.

The island suites very well with my temper hitherto, through bounty, it is
now and like to be very wealthy, full of sugar, cotton, indigo, and ginger,
some have made this year off one acre off canes about 4000 weight of sugar
ordinarily 3000. Much drought now oppresses, and I wonder, in the eye off
argument, at Gods great patience to so profaine a people for swearing and
drinking as the vulgar be. It must certainly, in my apprehension, be some strong
hand must reform them.

I would not be tedious to you. There has this year been brought over 3
commissions, one from the Earl of Warwick and commissioners with him to
command this government to profess themselves for the parliament, and to lay
aside their neutralitie. But this they seem not to embrace, but have answered
it thus, professing their willingness to be serviceable to the kingdom, their
honor for the parliament, but their yet allegiance to the King, therefore
desired to be spared a little till things be settled.

There were one other for liberty of conscience, that they have thus answered,
that they are not unwilling not to press any man's conscience in matters of
ceremony, only in regard there are many sects that under pretense off liberty
may take occasion to deny all ordinances, and so consequently the Lords day,
therefore this they would require of all, to come to the public preaching, and
that shall be sufficient.

There is a 3d, and that is to call the Governor and some off the Council into
question for some pretended acts off injustice here past. And these things to
be examined by inferior persons here, and that not off the best in matter of
opinion, and that seems to exasperate.

For so much, if I should be demanded how I think things will go here, I
would say, I am afraid when I consider off the profaness off the place, and
the divisions that are here and like to be, so much I certainly would say, had
not a man greater arguments to carry hither and here, for the present, to stay
him than temporalls, he would fail. How often have I thought in my heart, oh
how happy are New England people!

Not only thus, but even in respect off temporalls, for the common people, that
have but mean estates, are very mean in respect of provisions, little flesh
if any, noe bread but casader, a bread I approve not off; though its true the
rich live high.

The country to my sense is not very hott, but that which I like well off; and
a man with about 200 off pounds, in an ordinary way off providence, might
quickly gain an estate by sugar, which thrives wonderfully.

Capt. Middleton, master off the Parimour, is here like to settle, as he tells
me, your youngest son went from New England with him into the Straits.

I cease to write any news out off Old England, because I hear Capt. Leverate
came out with these ships here. Only we hear said the King defended Scotland
with 600 horse and were defeated and 2 or 300 cut off. We hear he is come to
the city, but noe certainty off that.

I have yet sent for my wife to me, in the midst off thief great
distractions, I shall be glad to hear from yourselff. Sorry I am that I have
not to express my dear engagement to your person. Whether I shall return for
New England I know not. Only this, I think I shall, and I pray New England may
not forgett your great labor there and your service amongst them. The desires
of my heart, as formerly, stille be for yourselfe and family. And if ever any
off yours fall within my ability, I much mistake myself if my respect should
not appear. Thus, begging your help at the throne off grace for me, in the
midst off this great profainess I am amongst and great heresy, with my
service and respect to your beloved, with the gentlemen your sons, Mr. Dudley
and the rest, Major Gibbins.

I yet remain, yours to my utmost services, J. Parker.
Barbados, 24. 4th, 46.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Endecott to Governor Winthrop.
Dearest Sir,
I Understand by Mr. Downing, that you have received letters from Mons.
D'Aulney, and that he will send to us about the 7th month. I could wish, if
you see it good, that the commissioners were acquainted with it, I mean of the
several provinces, and moved (if they see good) to be here, because I desire
they may be as thoroughly engaged in what is done or may be concluded as our
selves. If you intend to call a general court now, it will be in the midst of
all our occasions, and the country will much suffer in it. If it be any time
before D'Aulney's messenger comes to us, it will be well enough as far as I
can conceave, an if it were just at the time it would be the better, but I
(...) that as uncertain, unless he has appointed a certain time, but I
leave all to your better considerations. I humbly thank you for all the news
you have (...) us at several times; we find here the hand of God much upon
several men's grain by caterpillars, which threaten a dearth. The Lord fit us
for what he shall call us unto. To whose blessing I commend you and all yours,
and rest,

Yours unfeygnedly, Jo. Endecott.
My wife desires to have her service remembered to Mrs. Winthrop.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Steven Painter He was a benefactor to New England.
See Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 19.
to Governor Winthrop.
Sumers Islands this 24th of August 1646. Much Honored Sir,
THE Lord having clothed you with power to be ruler over his Israel, besides
those gifts and graces which do abound in you as a maine pillar in his house,
and you also do desire that justice may be administered to all men, causes me
to present you with these few lines in the behalf of the right honorable Earl
of Warwick, whose agent I am, that you would be pleased to afourde your best
assistance to Major Gibbins, for the recovery of my lords right of those two
ships which Captain Cromwell has brought to you, unto whom I have sent a copy
of my lords commission and a letter of aturney to enable him thereunto, so
nothing doubting of your worships favorable assistance I humbly take leave,

Yours in all christian servis, ever to be commanded, Steven Painter.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Humfrey to Governor Winthrop.
Honored Sir,
ALthough I have not occasion to be troublesome unto you as formerly in point
of my successless occasions, yet can I not be wanting to the acknowledgment of
any of those favors I formerly found from you. It is true the want of that
lost occasion (the loss of all I had in the world) does upon rubbings of that
irreparable blow, some times a little trouble me, but in no respect equal to
this, that I see my hopes and possibilities of ever enjoying those I did and
was ready to suffer any thing for utterly taken away. But by what
intermediate hand soever this is befallen me (whose neglects and unkindness
God I hope will mind them for their good yet I desire to look at his hand for
good (I doubt not) to me, though I do not so fully see which way it may work.
His fatherly administrations have hitherto been gracious, and I trust his
goodness and loving kindness will follow me all my days according to his own
free covenant upon which I desire to cast myself. Sir I thank you again and
again (and that in sincerity) for any fruits of your goodness to me or mine,
and for any thing contrary, I bless his name I labor to forget, and desire
him to pardon. For any thing from hence, I know you will have it from those
who have more ability and liberty to satisfy themselves and their friends in
these kinds; knowing myself unfitt to give these advertisements which the
state of things in your relations to us require. Therefore with my service and
best respects to good Mrs. Winthrop and yourselfe, Rev. Mr. Cotton, Mr. Willson
with theirs, yours and all our precious friends I rest,

Your (more willing than able to serve you) poor friend and servant. Jo.
Humfrey. This is the John Humfrey who was Deputy Governor in England and
afterward an Assistant in the Colony but, reduced by misfortunes, returned to
England.

If now you have any service to command me, you shall find me ready to serve
you, and therein it will it appear I serve not myself, the occasion of that
suspicion being taken away, and farewell it.

Gravesend, Sept. 4th, 1646.


AN ABSTRACT OF THE LAWS OF NEW ENGLAND. This piece was printed in London in
1655 and, by William Aspinwall the publisher, allowed to have been the
performance of Mr. Cotton. It should rather be entitled An Abstract of a Code
or System of Laws prepared for the Commonwealth of the Massachusetts Bay; for
although when they compiled their laws they made this abstract their plan, in
general, yet they departed from it in many instances, and in some which were
very material. "Considering that these plantations had liberty to mould their
civil order into that form which they should find to be best for themselves,
and that here the churches and commonwealth are complanted together in holy
covenant and fellowship with God in Christ Jesus, he did at the request of the
general court in the Baye draw an abstract of the laws of judgment delivered
from God by Moses to the Commonwealth of Israel, so far forth as they are of
moral, that is of perpetual and universal, equity among all nations, especially
such as these plantations are; wherein he advised that Theocracie, i. e. God's
government, might be established as the best form of government wherein the
people that choose civil rulers are God's people in covenant with him, that is
members of churches and the men, chosen by them to be rulers, such also, and
the laws of God and the ministers of God are consulted with by the governor,
magistrates and people, in all hard cases and in matters of the Lord, that is
of religion, etc. and for the clearing of his judgment with the grounds thereof
touching this matter I wish that some of his sermons to the general court were
printed." M. S. life of Mr. Cotton by Mr. Davenport.

CHAPT. I. Of Magistrates.
I. All the Magistrates are to be chosen 1. By the free Burgesses. Deuteronomy. 1.13.
Deuteronomy. 17.15. Jere. 30.21. Deuteronomy. 1.18.
2. Out of the free Burgesses. 3. Out of the ablest men and most approved among
them. 4. Out of the rank of noblemen or gentlemen amongst them, Exodus 18.21.
the best that God sends into the country, Ecclesiasticus 11.17.
if they be qualifyed with gifts fit for government, Jer. 30.21.
either eminent above others or not inferior to others.


II. The Governor has joint power with the Assistants to govern the whole
country, according to the laws established hereafter mentioned: He has power
of himself, and in his absence the deputy Governor, to moderate all public
actions of the common wealth.

1. As first, Josh. 24.1.
he sends out warrants for the calling of the general courts (except that of
elections)

2. To order and transact all actions in the court where he sits, as to
gather suffrages and votes, and to pronounce sentence according to the greater
part of them.

III. The power of the governor with the rest of the councillors is: Nu. 11
to 16.


1. Exo. 18.22.
To consult and provide for the maintenance of the state and people.

2. To direct in all hard matters wherein appeal is made to them from inferior
courts. Deu. 17.89.


3. To preserve religion. Exo. 32.27. and 25.40.


4. To oversee the sorts and munition of the country, 2 Chr. 19.11. 2 Kin.
20.13. 2 Chr. 32.21. etc.
and to take order for the protection of the country from foreign invasion or
intestine sedition, and as need shall require, with consent of the people, to
enterprise wars.

IV. And because these great affairs of the state cannot well and sufficiently
be attended, Exo. 17.9. Pro. 24.6. 1 Kin. 12.6. Pro. 28.2. Exo. 18.22.
nor wisely administered, if they be often changed, therefore the counselors
ought to be chosen for life, An attempt was made to establish what was called a
standing Council for life, as a distinct body from the Assistants, but the
Charter gave no authority for it, and the People would not submit to it.
unless they give just cause of removal, which if they do, then they to be
removed by the general court.

V. The power of the Governor sitting with the Counselors and Assistants,
Deu. 1.16.17.
is to hear and determine all causes, whether civil or criminal, which are
brought before him, through the whole commonwealth, yet reserving liberty of
appeal from him to the general court.

VI. Every town is to have judges within themselves, whose power shall be once
in the month, or in three months at the furthest, Deuteronomy. 16.18 Exo. 18.21 22
to hear and determine civil causes and pleas of less values, and crimes
also which are not capital, yet reserving liberty of appeal to the court of
Governor and Assistants.

VII. For the better expedition and execution of justice, and of all affairs
incident unto every court, every court shall have certain officers, Jer.
36.10, 11, and 12. 2 Samuel 20.24, 25.
as a secretary to inrolle all the acts of the court and besides, ministers of
justice to attach and fetch and set persons before the Magistrates, and also to
execute the sentences of the courts upon offenders: John 7.32.45. Acts 5.26,
and 27.
And for the same end it shall be lawful for the Governor, or any one or two
of the Counselors or Assistants, or Judges, to give warrant to an officer to
fetch the delinquent before them, and to examine the cause, Lev. 24.12. Number.
15.34.
and if he be found culpable of crime, to take order, by sureties or safe
custody, for his appearance at the court.

And further, for the same end and to prevent the offenders lying long in
prison, it shall be lawful for the Governor, with one of the Council, or any
two of the Assistants, or Judges, to see execution done upon any offenders for
any crime that is not capital, according to the laws established, yet still
reserving a liberty of appeal from them to the court, and from an inferior
court to an higher court.

CHAPT. II. Of free Burgesses and free Inhabitants.
I. All the free burgesses, excepting such as were admitted free men before the
establishment of churches in the country, shall be received and admitted out of
the members of some or other of the churches in this country, such churches as
are gathered or hereafter shall be gathered with the consent of other churches
already established in the country, and such members as are admitted by their
own church unto the Lord's table.

II. Those free burgesses shall have power to choose in their own towns sit
and able men out of themselves to be the ordinary judges of inferior causes in
their own town; and against the approach of the general court to choose two
or three as their deputies and committees to join with the governor and
assistants of the whole country to make up and constitute the general court.

III. This general court shall have power,

First, by the warrant of the governor, or deputy governor, to assemble once
every quarter or half year, The practice was every half year.
or oftener, as the affairs of the country shall require, and to sit together
till their affairs shall be dispatched.

Secondly, Call the governor and all the rest of the public magistrates and
officers unto place, and to call them also to account for the breach of any
laws established, or other misdemeanors and to censure them as the quality of
their fault may require.

Thirdly, To make and repeal laws.

Fourthly, To dispose of all the lands in the country and to assign them to
several towns or persons as shall be thought fit.

Fifthly, To impose a levy of moneys for the public service of the common
wealth, as shall be thought requisite for the provision and protection of the
whole.

Sixthly, To hear and determine all causes whether civil or criminal wherein
appeal shall be made unto them, or which they shall see cause to assume into
their own cognizance and judicature.

Seventhly, To assist the governor and counselors in the maintenance of the
purity and unity of religion, and accordingly to set forward and uphold all
such good causes as shall be thought fit for that end, by the advice and with
the consent of the churches and to repress the contrary.

IV. In this general court nothing shall be concluded but with common consent
of the greater part of the governor and assistants, together with the greater
part of the deputies of the towns, unless it be in the election of officers
where the liberty of the people is to be preserved, or in judging matters of
offense against the law wherein both parties are to stand to the direction of
the law.

V. All the householders in every town shall be accounted as the free
inhabitants Free inhabitants, but not freemen or free of the corporation.
of the country, and accordingly shall enjoy freedom of commerce and
inheritance of such lands as the general court or the several towns wherein
they dwell shall allot unto them, and they shall take an oath or give other
security to be true and faithful to the state, and subject to the good and
wholesome laws established in the country by the general court, when it shall
be required of them.

CHAPT. III. Of the Protection and Provision of the Country.
I. A law to be made, if it be not made already, for the training of all men in
the country fit to bear arms unto the exercise of military discipline, and
withal another law for the maintenance of military officers and fortes.

II. Because fish is the chief staple commodity of the country, therefore all
due encouragement to be given unto such hands as shall set forward the trade
of fishing, and for that end a law to be made that whosoever shall apply
themselves to set forward the trade of fishing, as fishermen, mariners and
shipwrights, shall be allowed man for man, some or other of the laborers of
the country to plant and reap for them in the season of the year at the
public charges of the common wealth, for the space of these seven years
next ensuing, and such laborers to be appointed and paid by the treasurer of
the common wealth.

III. Because noe common wealth can maintain either their authority at home,
or their honor and power abroad without a sufficient treasury, a law therefore
to be made for the erecting and furnishing of the treasury of the common
wealth, which is to be supplied and furnished.

1. By the yearly payment 1. Of a 1 d. or ob. an acre of land occupied
throughout the country: lands occupied in common by a town to be paid for out
of the stock or treasury of the same town. 2. Of a 1 d. for every beast,
horse or cow. 3. Of some proportionable rate upon merchants.


This rate to be great or less as shall be thought fit.

2. By the payment of a barrel of gunpowder or such goods or other munitions
out of every ship that brings foreign commodities.

3. By fines and mulcts upon trespassers.

IV. A treasurer to be chosen by the free burgesses out of the Assistants, who
shall receive and keep the treasury, and make disbursements out of it
according to the direction of the general court, or of the Governor and
Council, whereof they are to give an account at the general court. It shall
pertayne also to the office of the treasurer diligently to survey and oversee
all the munitions of the country, as cannons, culveringe, musketts, powder,
match, bullets, and to give account thereof to the Governor and Council.

V. A treasury also, or magazen, or storehouse, to be erected and furnished in
every town, as Deuteronomy. 14.28. distinct from the treasury of the church, that
provisions of corn and other necessaries may be laid up at the best hands, for
the relief of such poor as are not members of the church; and that out of it
such officers may be maintained, as captains and the like, who do any
public service for the town: But, chiefly, this treasury will be requisite
for the preserving of the livelihood of each town within itself. That in case
the inheritance of the lands that belong to any town come to be alienated
from the townsmen, which may unavoydably fall out, yet a supply may be made to
the livelihood of the town by a reasonable rent charge upon such alienations,
laid by the common consent of the land owners and townsmen, and to be paid
into the treasury of the town.

This Treasury to be supplied 1. By the yearly payment of some small rate upon
acres of land. 2. By fines or amerciaments put upon trespassers beasts. 3. By a
rent charge upon alienation of town lands.


A town treasurer to be appointed for the oversight and ordering of this
treasury, chosen out of the free burgesses of the same town; who is to dispose
of things under his charge according to the direction of the judges of the
town, and to give account at the towns court, to the judges and free
burgesses of the town, or to some elected by them.

CHAPT. IV. Of the Right of Inheritance.
I. Forasmuch as the right of disposal of the inheritance of all lands in the
country lies in the general court: whatsoever lands are given and assigned
by the general court to any town, or person, shall belong and remain as
right of inheritance to such towns, and their successors, and to such persons,
and to their heirs and assigns, as their propriety forever.

II. Whatsoever lands, belonging to any town, shall be given and assigned by
the town, or by such officers therein as they shall appoint, unto any person,
the same shall belong and remain unto such person, and his heirs and
assigns, as his proper right forever.

III. In dividing of lands to the several persons in each town, as regard is
to be had partly to the number of persons in a family, Number. 26.53.54.
to the more assigning the greater allotment, to the fewer less, and partly by
the number of beasts, Number. 35.3.
by the which a man is fit to occupy the land assigned to him and subdue it;
so eminent respect in this case may be given to men of eminent quality and
deserte, in assigning unto them more large and honorable accommodations in
regard of their greater disbursments to public charges.

IV. Forasmuch as all civil affairs are to be administered and ordered so as
may best conduce to the upholding and setting forwards of the worship of God in
church fellowship, it is therefore ordered, that wheresoever the lands of any
man's inheritance shall fall, yet noe man shall set his dwelling house above
the distance of half a mile, or a mile at the farthest, from the meeting house
of the congregation, where the church does usually assemble for the worship of
God. Acts 1.12.
Many advantages would have attended a law of this sort. Besides avoiding the
splitting and multiplying parishes, improvements would have been made in social
and civilized life by a more compact neighborhood. This law was never executed.


V. Inheritances are to descend naturally to the next of the kin, Numb. 27, ^
to 11.
according to the law of nature delivered by God.

VI. If a man have more sons then one, Deuteronomy. 21.17.
then a double portion to be assigned and bequeathed to the eldest son,
according to the law of God, 1 Chro. 5.1.
unless his own demerit do deprive him of the dignity of his birthright. The
like for personal estates.

VII. The will of the testator is to be approved or disallowed by the court of
governor and assistants, Heb. 9.17.
or by the court of judges in each town, Gal. 3.15.
yet not to be disallowed unless it appear either to be counterfeit or
unequal, either against the law of God, or against the public wealth, or
against the due right of the legatees.

VIII. As God in old time in the common wealth of Israel forbad the alienation
of lands from one tribe to another, so to prevent the like inconvenience in
the alienation of lands from one town to another, it were requisite to be
ordered.

1. That noe free burgess or free inhabitant of any town, shall sell the land
allotted to him in the town, but to some one or other of the free burgesses,
or free inhabitants of the same town, unless the free burgesses of the town
give consent unto such sale, or refuse to give a due price answerable to what
others offer without fraud.

2. That if such lands be sold to any others, the sale shall be made with
reservation of such a rent charge to be paid to the town stock, or treasury
of the town, as other the former occupiers of the land were wont to pay
toward all the public charges thereof, whether in church or town, More or
less as shall be thought fit.
or at least after the rate of 3d. an acre, or some such like proportion.

3. That if any free burgesses or free inhabitants of any town, or the heir
of any of their lands shall remove their dwelling from one town to another,
none of them shall carry away the whole benefit of the lands which they
possessed in the towns whence they remove; but if they still keep the right
of inheritance in their own hands, and not sell it, as before, then they shall
reserve a like proportion or rent charge out of their lands to be paid to the
public treasury of the town, as has been wont to be paid out of it to the
public treasury of the town and church, or at least after the rate of 3 d.
or 5 d. an acre, as before.

4. That if the inheritance of a free burgess or free inhabitant of any town
fall to his daughter, as it will do for defect of heirs males, that then if
such daughter do not marry to some of the inhabitants of the same town where
their inheritance lies, nor sell their inheritance to some of the same town
(as before) that then they reserve a like proportion of rent charge out of
their lands to be paid to the public treasury of the town, as has been wont
to be paid out of them to the public charges of the town and church, or at
least after the rate of 3 d. or 5 d. an acre. Provided allways that nothing be
paid to the maintenance of the church out of the treasury of the church or
town, but by the free consent and direction of the free burgesses of the
town. The provision made by this eighth section is an unnecessary imitation of
the laws of Moses, and every good end was answered by making the lands in each
town liable to the taxes and charges of such town, set the owners live where
they may.


CHAPT. V. Of Commerce.
I. It shall be lawful for the governor, with one or more of the council, to
appoint a reasonable rate of prises of all such commodities as are out of the
ships to be bought and sold in this country.

II. In trucking, or trading with the Indians, noe man shall give them for any
commodity of their silver or gold, or any weapons of war, either gunnes or
gunpowder, nor swords nor any other munition which might come to be used

III. To the intent that all oppression in buying and selling may be avoided,
it shall be lawful for the judges in any town, with the consent of the free
burgesses, to appoint certain select men to set reasonable rates upon all
commodities, and proportionably to limit the wages of workmen and laborers,
and the rates agreed upon by them, and ratifyed by the judges to bind all the
inhabitants of the town, the like course to be taken by the governor and
assistants, for the rating of prices throughout the country, and all to be
confirmed, if need be, by the general court.

IV. Just waights and balances to be kept between buyers and sellers, Lev.
19.35, 36. Prove. 11.1. and 15.11. and 20.10.

gained, with as much more added thereto, is to be forfeited to the public
treasury of the common wealth.

V. If a man borrow ought of his neighbor upon a pledge, Deuteronomy. 24, 10, 11, 12,
13.

pledge as is of daily necessary use unto the debtor, or if he do take it he
shall restore it again the same day. Ex. 22.26, 27.


VI. Exo. 22.25, Lev. 25.35, 36.
Noe interest to be taken of a poor brother or neighbor for any thing lent
unto him.

VII. If borrowed goods be lost or hurt in the owners absence, the borrower is
to make them good; but in the owners presence, Exo. 24.14, 15.
wherein he sees his goods noe otherwise used then with his consent, the
borrower shall not make them good. If they were hired, the hire is to be paid
and no more.

CHAPT. VI. Of Trespasses.
I. If a man's swine or any other beast, or a fire kindled by him break out into
another man's field or corn, he shall make restitution both of the damage done
by them and of the loss of time which others have had in carrying such swine
or beast unto the owners, or to the fold, Exo. 22.5.6.
but if a man put his beast or swine into another man's field, restitution is to
be made of the best of his own, though it were much better than that which was
destroyed or hurt.

II. If a man killes another man's beast, or digg or open a pit, and leave it
uncovered, Lev. 24.18. Exo. 21.34.
and a beast fall into it, he that killed the beast and the owner of the pit
shall make restitution.

III. If one man's beast kill the beast of another, Exo. 21 35, and 36.
the owner of the beast shall make restitution.

IV. If a man's ox or other beast goares or bite and kill a man or a woman,
Exo. 21.28, 29, 30, 31.
whether child or of riper age, the beast shall be killed and noe benefitt of
the dead beast reserved to the owner; but if the ox or beast were wont to push
or bite in times past, and the owner has been told it, and has not kept him
in, then both the ox or beast shall be forfeited and killed, and the owner
also put to death, or else fined to pay what the judges and persons damnified
shall lay upon him.

V. Ex. 22.7, 8, 9.
If a man deliver goods to his neighbor to keep and they be said to be lost
or stolen from him, Ex. 22.10, 11, 12.
the keeper of the goods shall be put to his oath touching his own innocence,
which if he take, and noe evidence appear to the contrary, he shall be quitt.
But if he be found false or unfaithful, he shall pay double unto his
neighbor: But if a man take hire for the goods committed to him, and they be
stolen, the keeper shall make restitution, but if the beast so kept for hire,
dye, or be hurt, or be driven away noe man seeing it, an oath shall be taken
of the keeper that it was without his default, and it shall be accepted; but if
the beast be torn in pieces, and a piece be brought for witness, it excuses
the keeper.

CHAPT. VII. Of Crimes.
And first of such as deserve capital punishment or cutting off from a man's

of christian religion, with obstinacy, if it be joined with endeavor to seduce

Exo. 32.27, 28.

XII. Unreverent and dishonorable carriage, in speech to, or concerning, Number.

our magistrates, to be punished with banishment for a time, till they
acknowledge their fault, and prosesse reformation, according to the quality of
the offense.

XIII. Reviling of the magistrates in highest rank amongst us, to wit, Exo.

dispute between them and the Colony was depending he found means to escape, and
there never was any person suffered death for this offense.


XVI. Murder, Ex. 21.12, 13.

whether sodomy, which is carnal fellowship of man with man, or of woman with

court or magistrate.

III. Forcing of a maid, or a rape, is not to be punished with death by Gods

and 28, 29.
2. With marriage of the maid desiled, to wit, if she and her father consent.
3. With corporal punishment of stripes, for this wrong is a real slander, and
it is worse to make a whore, than to say one is a whore.


IV. Fornication to be punished, 1. By marriage of the maid, or giving her a
sufficient dowry. Exo. 22, 16.
2. With stripes, though fewer, from the equity of the former case.

but in the day time the thief is to make full restitutution (as before) and
further punished for his attempt etc. by discretion; or if he be not able, then
to be sold as before.

VIII. Slanderers are to be punished, Deu. 22.17.18.
1. By a public acknowledgment, as the slander was public. 2. By mulcts or
fine of money, when the slander brings damage. 3. By stripes, if the slander
be gross, and odious, against such persons whom a man ought to honor and
cherish, whether they be his superiors, or in some degrees of equality with
himself, as his wife, etc.


CHAPT. IX. Of the trial of causes, whether civil or criminal, and the
execution of sentence.
I. In the trial of all causes, noe judgment shall pass, Deuteronomy. 19.4. and 17.6.
but either upon confession of the party, or upon the testimony of two
witnesses. Sufficient testimony.

II. Trial by jurors shall not be denied, where either the delinquent
requires it in causes criminal, or the plaintiff or defendant in civil
causes, partly to preserve the liberty of the people, and partly to prevent
suspicion of partiality of any magistrates in the court.

III. The jurors are not to be chosen by any magistrates or officers, but by

and being found to be true, full restitution is to be made out of the goods of
the offender, as the case shall require, and the offender himself to be
severely punished, according to the quality of the crime.

II. In case the people of another nation have done any important wrong to any
of ours, right is first to be demanded of the Governor of that people, and
justice upon the malefactor, Deu. 20.10.11. 2 Samuel 20.18,
which if it be granted and performed, then noe breach of peace to follow.

III. If right and justice be denied, and it will not stand with the honor of
God and safety of the nation that the wrong be past over, then war is to be

Answers of the Reverend Elders to certain Questions propounded to them. The
Elders were made umpires in a contention between the Governor and Assistants on
the one part, and the House of Deputies on the other. The patent, if the
corporation had continued in England as was intended, admits of no difficulty
in the construction of it. These doubts and questions arise merely from
changing a corporation in England into a common wealth in America. The
questions seem not to have been proposed all at the same time, but it appears
they were all answered before the year 1646.

Q. 1. WHETHER the magistrates are by pattent and election of the people the
standing counsel of the commonwealth, in the vacancie of the general court,
and have power accordingly to act in all cases subject to government according
to said pattent and the laws of this jurisdiction, and when any necessary
occasions call for action from authority, in cases where there is noe
particular express law provided, there to be guided by the word of God till
the general court give particular rules in such cases?

A. 1. The magistrates are by pattent and election of the people, the standing
counsel of the commonwealth in the vacancie of the general court, and
accordingly to act in all cases according to the pattent (pertaining to
government) and laws made by the said general court of this jurisdiction.
This answer is grounded upon sundry passages in the said pattent, as p. 10.
where it is said that the Governor, Deputy Governor and Assistants shall apply
themselves to take care of the best disposeing and ordering of the general
affairs and businesses of for and concerning the lands and premises and the
plantations thereof, and the government of the people there. Also p. 11. it is
said that the Governor, Deputy Governor and Assistants, or any number of them
as is expressed, shall be a full and sufficient court for the handling,
ordering and dispatching of all such businesses and occurrences as shall from
time to time happen touching and concerning the said company or plantation. And
it is said p. 12. that it is in the power of the general court to make laws
and ordinances for the good and welfare of the company, and they may make and
establish wholesome laws, statutes and ordinances for the settling of the forms
and ceremonies of government and magistracy, and for managing and settling all
sorts of officers, superior and inferior, and for the distinguishing and
setting forth the several duties, powers and limmitts in every such office and
place. 2dly. We do not find that by the pattent they are expressly directed to
proceed according to the word of God, but we understand that by a law or
liberty of the country, they may act in cases wherein as yet there is no
express law, so that in such acts they proceed according to the word of God.

Q. 2. Whether the Governor and Assistants have any power by pattent to
dispense justice in the vacancie of the general court, without some law or
order of the same to declare the rule?

A. We do not find in this commonwealth now constituted by this pattent that
the Governor and Assistants have any power to dispense justice in the vacancie
of the general court, without some law or order of the same, as the rule of
their administration, which we conceive were meet to be expressed for the
regulateing of all particulars as far as may be, when such cannot be supplied
by general rules.

Q. 3. Whether any general court has not power in particular cases to
choose any commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting all others,
to give their commission, to set forth their power and places by any
particular case, we mean in all things, and in those of all the officers the
commonwealth stands in need of between election and election, not taking away
the peoples liberties in election, nor turneing out any officer so elected by
them without showing cause?

A. If the terms (all things) intend or imply all cases of constant
judicature and counsel, we answer negatively, viz. that the general court
has not power by pattent in all cases to choose any officers, as
commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting that is excluding all
others, to give them commission, to set forth their power and places, because
it would then follow, that the magistrates might be excluded from all cases of
constant judicature and counsel which are their principal work, whereby
also the end of the peoples election would be made frustrate. 2dly. But if
these terms (all things) imply and intend cases, whether occasional or other,
belonging neither to constant judicature nor counsel, we answer affirmatively,
viz. The general court has power by pattent in such particular cases to
choose any officers and commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting
all others, to give them commission, to set forth their power and places,
which yet we understand with this distinction, viz. that if the affairs
committed to such officers or commissioners be of general concernment, we
conceive the freemen according to the pattent are to choose them, the general
court to set forth their power and places; but if the affairs committed to
such officers or commissioners be merely of particular concernment, then we
conceive the general court may both choose them and set forth their power
and places. Whereas we give places of constant judicature and counsel to the
magistrates, we thus interpret the word (counsel) Counsel consists of care
and action; in respect of care they are not to be limited, in respect of action
they are to be limited by the general court as the supreme counsel. Finally,
it is our humble request that if any difference grow in the general court
between magistrates and deputies, either in these or any the like weighty
cases which cannot be presently issued with mutual peace, then both parties
will be pleased to defer the same to further deliberation, for the honor of
God and of the court.

Q. 1. Whether the deputies in general court have judicial and magistraticall
authority?

Q. 2. Whether by pattent the general court, consisting of magistrates and
deputies, as a general court, have judicial and magistraticall authority?

A. 1. The pattent in express words gives full power and authority, as to
the governor and assistants so to the freemen also assembled in general
court, p. 11. 2dly, Whereas there is a 3 fold power of magistraticall
authority, legislative, judicative, and consultative or directative, of the
public affairs of the commonwealth, for provision and protection. The 1st of
these, namely, legislative, is expressly given to the freemen jointly with the
governor and assistants, p. 12. Consultative or directative power of the
public affairs of the commonwealth, for provision and protection, is also
granted by the pattent unto the freemen as to the governor and assistants, p.
13. But now for the judicature, if we speak of the constant and usual
administration hereof, we do not find that it is granted to the freemen or
deputies in the general court, either by the pattent or by the election of
the people, or by any law of the country. But if we speak of the occational
administration thereof we find the power of judicature administrable by the
freemen jointly with the governor and assistants, upon a double occasion, 1. In
case of defect or delinquency of a magistrate we find the whole general court
of governor, deputy governor, assistants and freemen may proceed to remove him,
p. 12. 2dly. If by the law of the country there lie any appeal to the
general court or any other special causes referred to their judgment, it
will necessarily infer that in such cases, by such laws, the freemen jointly
with the governor and assistants have power of judicature touching the
appealeants and cause, the appeal and those reserved cases. What we speak of
the power of freemen, the same may be said of deputies, so far forth as the
power of the freemen is delegated to them by order of law.

Q. 3. Whether we may warrantably prescribe penalties to offenses which may
probably admit of variable degrees of guilt?

Q. 4. Whether a judge be bound to pronounce sentence as a positive law
prescribes, in case it be apparently above or beneath the merit of the offense?

A. 1. Certain penalties may and ought to be prescribed to capital crimes,
although they may admit variable degrees of guilt, as in case of murder upon
prepensed malice and upon sudden provocation there is prescribed the same death
in both, though murder upon a prepensed malice be a far greater guilt than
upon sudden provocation, Number. 35, 16, 17, 18. with ver. 20 21. also in crimes
of less guilt, as in theift, though some theift be of greater guilt than other
(as for some men to steal a sheep that has less need is of greater guilt
than for another who has more need) the Lord prescribed one same measure of
restitution to both, Exodus 22.1. 2dly, In case variable circumstances of an
offense do so much vary the degrees of guilt, as that the offense is raised
to a higher nature, then the penalty must be varied to an higher answerable
proportion; the strikeing of a neighbor may be punished with some pecuniary
mulct, when the strikeing of a father may be punished with death; so any sin
committed with an hie hand, as the gathering sticks of the Sabbath day may be
punished with death, when a lesser punishment might serve for gathering sticks
privily and in some need. 3dly, In case circumstances do so vary a sin as
that many sins are complicated and wrapped up in it, the penalty is to be
varied according to the penalty of those several sins. A single lie may be
punished with a less mulct than if it be told before the judgment seat, or
elsewhere to the damage of any person, whether in his good name by slander, or
in his estate by detriment in his commerce, in which case a lie aggravated by
circumstances is to be punished with respect both to a lie and a slander, and
to the detriment which another sustaineth thereby. 4thly, In case that the
circumstances, which vary the degrees of guilt, concern only the person of
the offender (as whether it were his first offense, or customarie, whether he
was enticed thereto or the inticer, whether he was principal or accessory,
whether unadvised or wittingly and willingly, etc.) there it were meet that
the penalty should be expressed with a latitude, whereof the lowest degree to
be expressed, suppose 5 s. or as the case may be 5 stripes, and the highest
degree 20 s. or 40 s. or stripes more or less, within which compass or latitude
it may be free to a magistrate to aggravate or mitigate the penalty as the
circumstances do require or alleviate the offense. Yet we would have care be
taken that a magistrate attend in his sentence to a certain rule, as much as
may be in those circumstances, lest some person whose sins be alike
circumstantiated with another, if his punishment be not equal the one with the
other, one may think himself more unequally dealt withal than another.
5thly, In those cases wherein a judge is persuaded in conscience that a crime
deserved a greater punishment than the law inflicteth, he may lawfully
pronounce sentence according to the prescript penalty of the law, because he
has noe power committed to him by law to go higher; but where the law may
seem to the conscience of the judge to inflict a greater penalty than the
offense deserves, it is his part to suspend his sentence till by conferrence
with the lawgivers he has liberty, either to inflict the sentence or to
mitigate it. 6thly, The penalties of great crimes may be sometimes mittigated
by such as are in chief power, which in this country is the general court,
out of respect to the public good services which the delinquent has done to
the state in former times; so Solomon mittigated the punishment of Abiathar for
his service done to his father formerly, 1 Kings 2.26, 27.

Q. 1. Whether the distinction of power and authority in magistrates, and only
liberty of counsel in the people, be according to the pattent, with respect
of the magistrates and deputies in the general court?

A. We conceive by the pattent, as the people have liberty of counsel, so
they have also other power or authority, as we have expressed in our answer to
the two first questions sent unto us by our honored magistrates.

Q. 2. Whether the general court, consisting of magistrates and deputies, be
not the chief power of this commonwealth, and to describe the power of
magistracy, and to prescribe laws to all, and do all other acts which belong
to such a power?

A. The general court, consisting of magistrates and deputies, is the chief
civil power of this commonwealth, so as to prescribe the power of magistracy
and to prescribe in a civil way laws unto all, not repugnant unto the laws
of God, nor to the pattent, nor to the fundamental laws and liberties
established in this commonwealth, and accordingly may do all other acts which
belong to such a power, as namely, both acts of counsel tending to the
provision and protection and welfare of the whole body, and also acts of
judgment, so far as (according to our answer to the two former questions of
our honored magistrates) is by the pattent or choice of the people or laws of
the commonwealth reserved to them and seated in them.

Q. 3. Whether our government be a pure aristocracie or mixed with a democracie?
If mixed, whether it should not be mixed in all the administrations of the same?

A. 1. Our government is not a mere aristocracy, but mixed of an aristocracy
and democracy, in respect of the general court. 2dly, Notwithstanding it be
mixed in the general court, yet it follows not necessary thereupon, that it
should be mixed in all other courts and administrations thereof, because our
form (as all other forms of civil government) is the ordinance of man,
therefore as it was free to make it mixed or simple, so also to make it mixed
in the general court and united in others according to the pleasures of the
ordeiners thereof. Accordingly our pattent, notwithstanding it has made our
government mixed in respect of the general court, yet it seems to have
instituted subordinate administrations of justice to be aristocratically
dispensed by the court of assistants; yet even in these courts there is some
place for a democratical dispensation in respect of the jurors.

It was voted that all the answers given in by the reverend Elders to the
several questions, were approved just and true answers to satisfaction, except
such as are not put to vote.

Prop. 1. That the assistants have noe power to act in judicature without some
law of the general court to declare the rule.

Elders. That the assistants have noe power to act in judicature without some
law, either particularly expressed, or in general terms, in defect thereof,
enacted by the general court as the rule of their administrationes.

Prop. 2. That the general court consisting of magistrates and deputies is the
chiefest power of this commonwealth, and may act in all things belonging to
such a power concerning counsel and judicature, namely for making laws,
receiving appeals, questioning and sentencing the highest officers, and
consulting about the weightiest affairs of the common wealth and in all other
cases which in their wisdom they think meet to take cognizance of.

Elders. That the general court consisting of magistrates and deputies is the
chiefest power of this common wealth, and may act in all things belonging to
such a power, both concerning counsel in consulting about the weighty affairs
of this common wealth and concerning laws, also concerning judicature in
orderly impeaching, sentanceing and removing officers, even the highest
according to law, likewise in receiving appeals, whether touching civil or
criminal cases wherein appeals are or shall be allowed by the general court.

Prop. 3. That the magistrate has not power to vary from the penalties of any
law either to mitigate or exceed the same.

Elders. That the magistrate has not power to vary from the penalty of any
law either to mitigate or exceed the same without consent of the general court.

Prop. 4. That the patent in express words gives full power and authority as
to the governor and assistants so to the freemen also assembled in general
court.

Elders. That the patent in express words gives full power and authority as
to the governor and assistants so to the freemen also assembled in general
court, or thus, that the full power which is prescribed by the patent and
granted by the general court is not only to the governor and assistants, but
also to the freemen there assembled and acting with common consent.

Prop. 5. That certain penalties may and ought to be prescribed in cases
although the offenses admit of variable degrees of guilt.

Elders. That certain penalties may and ought to be prescribed in cases
although the offenses admit of variable degrees of guilt.

A Remonstrance and Petition of Robert Child, and others.
To the worshipful the Governor, the Deputy Governor, and the rest of the
Assistants of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, together with the Deputyes
of the General Court now assembled at Boston. The Remonstrance and humble
Petition of us whose names are underwritten, in behalf of ourselves and diverse
others within this jurisdiction, humbly shows,
THAT we cannot but with all thankfulness acknowledge your indefatigable pains,
continual care and constant vigilance, which, by the blessing of the Almighty,
has procured unto this wilderness the much desired fruits of peace and plenty:
While our native land, yea the christian world, is sharply afflicted with the
devouring sword and the sad consequents of intestine wars. And further, that
you whom the Lord has placed at the helm of these plantations and endowed
with eminent gifts fit for such honorable callings, are best able to foresee
the clouds which hang over our heads, the storms and tempests which threaten
this poor handful here planted, and timously to amend them. Notwithstanding
those who are under decks, being at present unfit for higher employments, may
perceive those leaks which will inevitably sink this weak and ill compacted
vessel, if not by your wisdoms opportunely prevented. We who, in behalf of
ourselves and diverse of our Countrymen, laying our hands upon our breasts and
seriously considering that the hand of our good God, who through his goodness
has safely brought us and ours through the great ocean and planted us here,
seems not now to be with us, yea rather against us, blasting all our designs,
though contrived with much deliberation, undertaken with great care, and
proceeding with more than ordinary probability of successful events, by which
many of good estates are brought to the brink of extreme poverty, yea at this
time laying his just hand upon our familyes, taking many away to himself,
striking others with unwonted malignant sicknesses, and with some shameful
diseases, have thought it convenient with all respectivenesse to present these
our sincere requests and remonstrances to this honored court, hoping we have
found out those special leaks, which concurring with many and great sins of
this place (which our consciences know and our brethren of England are not
ignorant of) are the special causes of the Lords turning his face from us,
leaving us to ourselves, and consequently to strife, contention,
unfaithfulness, idleness, and of lamentable faylings, not blessing us in any of
our endeavors, so as to give us any great hopes of staple commodities, and
consequently of comfortable subsistence, though we, to the utmost of our power,
these many years, even to the exhausting of our estates and spirits, have
endeavored the same; but contrariwise, all things grow worse and worse, even
to the threatening (in our apprehensions) of no less than small ruin; not
doubting but you will receive them with the same candor of mind which we, not
aiming at novelty or disturbance, but at the glory of God, our allegiance to
the state of England, and good of these poor plantations (if our hearts deceive
us not) present them unto you, though for want of skill and other necessary
help roughly drawn up; and hope that you will be more diligent in amending
than we in searching out the causes of these our present calamities, etc. Not
to trouble you who are employed in the most serious affairs of these
plantations with many words, we shall briefly refer them to these heads, etc.

1. Whereas this place has been planted by the encouragement, next under God,
of letteris patents given and granted by his Majesty of England to the
inhabitants thereof, with many privileges and immunities, viz. Incorporation
into a company, liberty of choosing governors, settling government, making laws
not repugnant to the laws of England, power of administering the oath of
allegiance to all, etc. as by the said letters patents more largely appears.
Notwithstanding, we cannot, according to our judgments, discern a settled form
of government according to the laws of England, which may seem strange to our
countrymen, yea to the whole world, especially considering we are all English.
Neither do we so understand and perceyve our own laws or libertyes, or any
body of laws here so established, as that thereby there may be a sure and
comfortable enjoyment of our lives, libertyes, and estates, according to our
due and natural rights, as freeborne subjects of the English nation. By which,
many inconveniences flow into plantations, viz. jealousies of introducing
arbitrary government, which many are prone to believe, construing the
procrastination of such settled laws to proceed from an overgreedy spirit of
arbitrary power (which it may be is their weakness) such proceedings being
detestable to our English nation, and to all good men, and at present a chief
cause of the intestine war in our dear country: Further, it gives cause to
many to think themselves hardly dealt with, others too much favored, and the
scale of justice too much bowed and unequally balanced: From whence also
proceeds fears and jealousies of illegal committments, unjust
imprisonments, taxes, rates, customs, levyes of ungrounded and undoing
assessments, unjustifiable presses, undue fynes, unmeasurable expenses and
charges, of unconceyvable dangers through a negative or destructive vote unduly
placed, and not well regulated, in a word, of a non certainty of all things we
enjoy, whether lives, liberties or estates; and also of undue oaths, being
subject to exposition, according to the will of him or them that gives them,
and not according to a due and unbowed rule of law, which is the true
interpreter of all oaths to all men, whether judge or judged.

Wherefore our humble desire and request is, that you would be pleased to
consider of our present condition and upon what foundation we stand, and
unanimously concur to establish the fundamental and wholesome laws of our
native country, and such others as are no ways repugnant to them, unto which
all of us are most accustomed; and we suppose them best agreeable to our
English tempers, and yourselves obliged thereunto by the general charter and
your oaths of allegiance. Neither can we tell, whether the Lord has blessed
many in these parts with such eminent political gifts, so as to contrive
better laws and customs than the wisest of our nation have with great
consideration composed, and by many hundred years experience have found most
equal and just; which have procured to the nation much honor and renown
amongst strangers, and long peace and tranquillity amongst themselves. And for
the more strict and due observation and execution of the said laws by all the
ministers of justice, That there may be a settled rule for them to walk by in
all cases of judicature, from which if they swerve there may be some power
settled, according to the laws of England, that may call them to account for
their delinquences, which may be a good means to prevent diverse unnecessary
appeals into England.

2. Whereas there are many thousands in these plantations, of the English
nation, freeborne, quiett and peaceable men, righteous in their dealings,
forward with hand, heart and purse, to advance the public good, known friends
to the honorable and victorious Houses of Parliament, lovers of their nation,
etc. who are debarred from all civil employments (without any just cause that
we know) not being permitted to bear the least office (though it cannot be
denied but some are well qualifyed) no not so much as to have any vote in
choosing magistrates, captains or other civil and military officers;
notwithstanding they have here expended their youth, borne the burden of the
day, wasted much of their estates for the subsistence of these poor
plantations, paid all assessments, taxes, rates, at least equal, if not
exceeding others, yea when the late war was denounced against the
Narrowganset Indians, without their consent, their goods were seized on for the
service, themselves and servants especially forced and impressed to serve in
that war, to the hazarding of all things most dear and near unto them, whence
issue forth many great inconveniences, secret discontents, murmurings, rents in
the plantations, discouragements in their callings, unsettlednes in their
minds, strife, contention, and the Lord only knows to what a flame in time it
may kindle; also jealousies of too much unwarranted power and dominion on the
one side, and of perpetual slavery and bondage on the other, and which is
intolerable, even by those who ought to love and respect them as brethren.

We therefore desire that civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to
all truly English, equal to the rest of their countrymen, as in all
plantations is accustomed to be done, and as all freeborne enjoy in our native
country; (we hoping here in some things to enjoy greater liberties than
elsewhere, counting it no small loss of liberty to be as it were banished from
our native home, and enforced to lay our bones in a strange wilderness) without
imposing any oaths or covenant on them, which we suppose cannot be warranted
by the letters patent, and seem not to concur with the oath of allegiance
formerly enforced on all, and later covenants lately imposed on many here
present by the honorable houses of parliament, or at least to detract from our
native country and laws, which by some are styled foreign, and this place
termed rather a free state, than a colonie or corporation of England; all of us
being very willing to take such oaths and covenants as are expressions of our
desires of advanceing the glory of God and good of this place, and of our
duties to the state of England, and love to our nation, being composed
according to the laws and customs of other corporations of England; but all
of us are exceeding unwilling by any policies whatsoever to be rent from our
native country, though far distant from it, valuing our free derivations, the
immunities and privileges which we and our posterity do and we hope shall
always enjoy above the greatest honors of this country, not cemented to the
state of England, and glory to be accounted though but as rushes of that land,
yet that we may continue to write that we and ours are English; or least we
entreat that the bodies of us and ours (English subjects possessing here no
privileges) may not be impressed, nor goods forcibly taken away, least we, not
knowing the justice of his war, may be ignorantly and unwillingly enforced
upon our own destruction, and that all assessment, taxes, impositions, which
are many and grievous (if civil liberty be not granted) may be taken of, that
in all things we may be strangers, otherwise we suppose ourselves in a worse
case here and less free than the natives amongst whom we live, or any aliens.
Further, that none of the English nation, who at this time are too forward to
be gone, and very backward to come hither, be banished, unles they break the
known laws of England in so high a measure, as to deserve so high a
punishment; and that those few that come over may settle here without having
two magistrates hands, which sometimes not being possible to obtain, has
procured a kind of banishment to some, who might have been serviceable to this
place, as they have been to the state of England, etc. And we likewise desire
that no greater punishments be inflicted upon offenders than are allowed and
set by the laws of our native country.

3. Whereas there are diverse sober, righteous and godly men, eminent for
knowledge and other gracious gifts of the holy spirit, no ways scandalous in
their lives and conversation, members of the church of England (in all ages
famous for piety and learning) not dissenting from the latest and best
reformation of England, Scotland, etc. yet they and their posterity are
detained from the seals of the covenant of free grace, because, as it is
supposed, they will not take these churches covenants, for which as yet they
see no light in Gods word; neither can they clearly perceive what they are,
every church having their covenant differing from another, at least in words:
Yea some churches sometime adding, sometime detracting, calling it sometimes
the covenant of grace, sometimes a branch of it, sometimes a profession of the
free covenant, etc. notwithstanding they are compelled, under a severe fine,
every Lords day to appear at the congregation, and notice is taken of such who
stay not till baptism be administered to other men's children, though denied to
their own; and in some places forced to contribute to the maintenance of those
ministers who vouchsafe not to take them into their flock, though desirous of
the ordinances of God, etc. yet they are not accounted so much as brethren, nor
publicly so called, nor is christian vigilance (commanded to all) any way
exercised to them. Whence, as we conceive, do abound an ocean of
inconveniences, dishonor to God and to his ordinances, little profit by the
ministry, increase of anabaptisme, and of those that totally contemn all
ordinances as vain, fading of christian graces, decrease of brotherly love,
heresies, schisms, etc. the whole body of the members of the church of
England, like sheep scattered in the wilderness, without a shepherd, in a
forlorn condition.

We therefore humbly entreat you, in whose hands it is to help and whose
judicious eyes discern these great inconveniences, for the glory of God and the
comfort of your brethren and countrymen, to give liberty to the members of the
church of England, not scandalous in their lives and conversations (as members
of these churches) to be taken into your congregation and to enjoy with you all
those liberties and ordinances Christ has purchased for them, and into whose
name they are baptized, that the Lord may be one and his name one amongst us in
this place; that the seals of the covenant may be applied to them and their
posterity, as we conceive they ought to be, till inconveniences hereby be found
prejudicial to the churches and colony (which we hope shall never be) not
doubting but the same christian favor will be showed to all its members of
these churches, when they shall retire to our dear native country (if their
conversations be righteous and holy) or otherwise to grant liberty to settle
themselves here in a church way, according to the best reformations of England
and Scotland, if not, we and they shall be necessitated to apply our humble
desires to the honorable houses of parliament, who we hope will take our sad
conditions into their serious considerations, to provide able ministers for us
(this place not being so well provided as to spare any) or else out of their
charity, many estates being wasted, to transport us to some other place, where
we may live like christians and not be accounted burdens, but serviceable both
to church and state.

These things being granted, by the blessing of God to us in Christ, we hope to
see the now contemned ordinances of God highly prized, the gospel much
darkened, break forth as the sun at noon day, christian charity and brotherly
love, almost frozen, wax warm, zeal and holy emulation more fervent, jealousy
of arbitrary government (the bane of all common wealths) quite banished, the
wicked, if any such be found, in their courses disheartened, the righteous
actors in their ways encouraged, secret discontents fretting like cankers,
remedied, merchandising and shipping by special providence wasted, speedily
increased, mines undertaken with more chearfulnes, fishing with more
forwardnes, husbandry now withering forthwith flourishing, villages and
plantations much deserted presently more populous, all mechanical trades the
great enriching of all common wealths heartily going on, staple commodities the
life of trade presently raised, our almost lost credit regayned, our brethren
of Englands just indignation and their force as a post flying from us turned to
embrace us, the honorable houses of parliament patrons of piety under their
wings in these dangerous times with alacrity shrowding us, the privileges and
immunities which we and ours enjoy in our native land more firmly settled,
foreign enemies daily threatening totally discouraged, unsettled men now
abounding firmly planted, that the prosperity of England may not be the ruin
of this plantation but the contrary, hands, hearts and purses now straightened
freely opened for public and honorable services, strife and contention now rife
abated, taxes and sesses lightened, the burdens of the state but pleasure, etc.
To conclude, all businesses in church and common wealth which for many years
have seemed to go backward, beyond our desert yea expectation, the good hand of
our God going along with us, successfully thriving.

And shall always pray the Almighty, the only wise God, to guide you with his
wisdom, strengthen you with his power in all your undertakings, that all may be
for the glory and good of his people, and that he would bless your wisdom with
the blessing of peace, plenty, and long days, etc.

Subscribed, Robert Child, Thomas Burton, John Smith, Thomas Foul, David Yale,
Samuel Maverick, John Dand.


A Declaration of the General Court holden at Boston 4 (9) 1646. concerning a
Remonstrance and Petition exhibited at last Session of this Court by Doctor
Child, Thomas Foul, Samuel Maverick, Thomas Burton, John Smith, David Yale,
and John Dand.
IN this Petition and Remonstrance (as they call it) which is the first of the
sort that we have received, and (as we conceive) without president in any
plantation or established commonwealth, as will appear by the small cause of
such remonstrance, and as little reason for what is petitioned. We first
observe the solemn and religious profession they make of the sincerity and
singleness of their end in respect of the glory of God and the good of this
colonie, which we have reason to be jealous of with a godly jealousy, when we
consider what connection and affinity there is between such great and glorious
ends and the pursuit they make in their remonstrance, so far from truth and
righteousness, together with the means they have propounded for attaining the
fame. We therefore wish them well and deeply to consider that they have herein
to do with him by whom actions are weighed, whose eyes are like a flame of
fire, who will make all the churches know that he searches the heart and the
reins, and will render to every one of them according to their works. It
were a dreadful dareing presumption, if the blessed name of the most high God
(whose honor is so often avouched to be their aim in this design) should be
made to serve a corrupt project. The next thing we observe is, a divine
overruling hand leadinge them to a clear acknowledgment of that truth which
cutts the sinews of their remonstrance, and justifies our government and all
the administrations thereof, against all that reproach and blame they endeavor
after to cast upon it. The words are these, We cannot but with all thankfulness
acknowledge your indefatigable pains, continual care and constant vigilance,
which (by the blessing of the Almighty) has procured unto this wilderness the
most desired fruits of peace and plenty; whilst our native land (yea the
christian world) is sharply afflicted, etc. From which words we infer these
4 propositions. 1. The government established in this colonie (by the blessing
of the Lord) has been dispensed and administered, from the first to last, with
a special and eminent measure of care and watchfullnes upon all occasions.
2dly, By the blessing of the Lord, the government established and administered
as aforesaid, has been a procuring cause of peace and plenty to this
colonie. 3dly, By the blessing of the Lord, the government established as
aforesaid, and the good effects thereof have been granted to us in this
wilderness, and that at such a season, while not only our native country, but
the christian world, are sharply visited and afflicted with contrary evils (we
may say in this case with astonishment, Not unto us, Lord, but to thy name be
the praise, we confess it is our shame (we desire it may be also our sorrow)
that we have not rendered to the Lord according to his great goodness.) 4thly,
The Petitioners (by their own confession) have not only no cause to blame
this government, or the administration or effects thereof, but are bound with
all thankfulness to acknowledge the good fruits thereof, as wherein themselves
have had their share.

These four propositions (allowing to the first of them that which humane
frailty calls for) are (as we conceive) no less evident in the truth of them
than in their dependence upon the petitioners own words. Yet we observe 3dly,
How they sometimes send forth sweet water and bitter. For in the following
passages they speak of leakes, which (they say) will inevitably sink this
weak and ill-compacted vessel, which they wholly impute to the evils of our
government, civil and ecclesiastical, both in the administration and effects
thereof. And though in the said propositions, they make us monuments of mercy,
preferring us above our native country, yea above the christian world; yet, in
the conclusion they affirm the quite contrary; houlding us forth as the scumme
and offscouring, such as our brethren in England, in their just indignation,
avoyde as a pest, which they wholely ascribe to the evils of our government.
They highly commend the administration of this government, and yet complain of
an arbitrary power, detestable (as they say) to our English nation and to all
good men. They commend this government in respect of care and watchfulnes; and
yet they speak of many sheep in this wilderness without shepherd, in a
forlorn condition. They largely acknowledge the good effects of this
government; and yet cry out of intolerable slavery and bondage. They commend
it in respect of peace and plenty; and yet they speak of discontents fretting
like cancers, of merchants wasteing, of husbandry withering, of villages and
plantations much desolated, and that all business both in church and
commonwealth have seemed to go backward, and that for many year. They commend
it in respect of peace; and yet affirm they have no security of their lives
and liberties, but are under a non certainty of all they enjoy. They commend it
in respect of peace; and yet speak of contentions, ready to break out into a
fearful flame, blameing the government as the cause thereof. They commend it in
respect of plenty; yet prosesse they are brought to the brinke of extreme
poverty, so as they beg of the parliament some help for transportation to some
other place. They profess they owe acknowledgment with all thankfulness for
what they here enjoy; and yet affirm that by reason of unjustifiable,
ungrounded and undue taxes imposed on them, they are in worse condition than
the natives themselves. They profess such acknowledgment as aforesaid; and yet
affirm that they are in such a place, where they cannot live like christians.

These petitioners fabric being thus overthrown by their own confession
and manifest contradictions, we might have thrown out their petition, as not
worthy our further trouble, but lest they should pretend, that their said
thankful acknowledgment was but a complement, or a piece of their rhetoric
(ad acquirendam gratiam) to gain favor (yet let them consider what we put
them in mind of at first, how dangerous it is to engage the great name of the
Almighty, to advance their corrupt and uncharitable designs. (Nec tutum est
ludere cum sacris) It is not safe to dally with things sacred. We will
therefore, for the petitioners more clear conviction, and further satisfaction
to all the world, examine their particular grievances, and other passages which
we meet with in their remonstrance, etc. and give such account of our
government and administrations both civil and ecclesiastical, as none shall be
able (we hope) to contradict the truth thereof.

For our government itself, it is framed according to our charter, and the
fundamental and common laws of England, and carried on according to the same
(taking the words of eternal truth and righteousness along with them, as that
rule by which all kingdoms and jurisdictions must render account of every act
and administration, in the last day) with as bare allowance for the
disproportion between such an ancient, populous, wealthy kingdom, and so poor
an infant thin colonie, as common reason can afford. And because this will
better appear by compareing particulars, we shall draw them into a parallel.
In the one column we will set down the fundamental and common laws and
customs of England, beginning with Magna Charta, and so go on to such others
as we had occasion to make use of, or may at present suite with our small
beginnings: In the other column we will set down the sum of such laws and
customs as are in force and use in this jurisdiction, showing withal (where
occasion serves) how they are warranted by our charter. As for those positive
laws or statutes of England, which have been from time to time established
upon the basis of the common law, as they have been ordained upon occasions, so
they have been alterable still upon like occasion, without hazarding or
weakening the foundation, as the experience of many hundred years has given
proof of. Therefore there is no necessity that our own positive laws (which
are not fundamental) should be framed after the pattern of those of England,
for there may be such different respects, as in one place may require
alteration, and in the other not.

For ourselves, we must profess our insufficiency for so great matters (as
the remonstrants also judge of us) and that in the laws of England we have but
the knowledge of novices, which is mixed with ignorance, and therefore such
faileings as may appear either in our collection of those laws, or in
conforming our own to that pattern, are to be imputed to our want of skill.
If we had able lawyers amongst us, we might have been more exact.

Magna Charta.
1. THE Church shall enjoy all her liberties.

2. No man shall be condemned but by lawful trial: Justice shall not be sold,
deferred nor denied to any man. All men's liberties and free customs shall be
reserved.

3. All cities and towns shall have their liberties and free customs.

By this it may appear that our politic and fundamentalls are framed according
to the laws of England, and according to the charter; so that the petitioners
(if they had not cast off all modesty) must needs be ashamed of this complaint,
as also of those which follow, viz. Arbitrarie government, The negative vote,
Illimited oaths, Unjust taxes, Illegal committments, etc. For the first, we
use to say, Rome was not built in a day: Nay, they could write of it many
hundred years after, Tantae molis erat, etc. Let them produce any colonie or
commonwealth in the world, where more has been done in 16 years. Let them
show where has been more care and strife to prevent all arbitrarines, and to
bring all judgments to a certain rule, so far as may be. Let them confess
their ignorance of the judicial proceedings in England, or their malice
which setts them on, to take up any thing to throw at us, though it cut their
own fingers, as the practice of England (which they would seem so much to
adhere unto) will most certainly do, if they look into any of those courts
of judicature (except it be the common pleas) but especially the chauncery
(which is the highest court of judicature) the court of requests, the chauncery
of the exchequer and of the duchy, in which courts they are not tied to the
common laws or statutes of England, but do judge arbitrarily (secundum aequum
et bonum) according to equity. If they can give no reasonable answer here (as
we are sure they cannot) they must either harden their hearts or confess
their guilt, and be as careful to reform their arbitrary obedience, as we
are to keep off arbitrary government. We may say the same for the second, the
Negative vote. Sure these men would seem to have mysteries of state in their
heads, and they mean to keep them there. They tell us of a destructive
negative vote, but they neither show where nor what this danger is, nor what
remedy for it. It may be they have found out a way how a mixed government may
subsist without a negative vote, which this court (with all the help of all the
elders, and other the wisest in the country, after two or three years
endeavor) could not attain; nor would the far deeper wisdom of the
parliament of England ever attempt it (and that these remonstrants are not
ignorant of) nor do they affect a democracie. Therefore this must needs be put
in only as a fine device (ad faciendum populum) to please the people. For the
third, viz. Illimitted oaths, and covenants not explained by law: They should
have done well to have told us what oaths and covenants they mean, for
(dolus versatur in universalibus) deceit lies hid in generals. We know no
oaths we impose upon any, other than such as are allowed by our charter, and
were in practice by the company in London (as occasion required) before we came
into these parts. And for covenants of a civil nature, there has not been so
much as any mention of any such amongst us these many years, save only, the
last year, a motion was made in court of complying with our native country in
the national covenant there, which was referred to further consideration. As
for our church covenant, that shall be spoken to in its proper place. Besides
(to prevent all such burdens) we have established a law to that end, as
appears here before. 5thly, For unjust taxes, there is none that come amongst,
us or hear of our condition and affairs, but will marvel for what purpose
such great sums should be raised upon the country, as should occasion this
grievance; seeing we attempt nothing of chardge, but what is necessary, and
what the freemen and members of the court contribute unto, as largely as any
other. We spend nothing superfluously in buildings, feastings, pensions, public
gratuities, officers fees, or the like; nay we are ashamed sometimes at our
penuriousnes, but that we had rather bear shame and blame, than overburden the
people. Such as are in chief office amongst us are content to live beneath the
honor of their places that they might ease the common charge. All our public
expenses have been about some small fortifications, making laws, dispenseing
justice, some expeditions against the Indians, who by their injuries and
insolences have provoked us thereunto, and some foreign occasions of late,
which accidentally fell upon us. If the remonstrants have known of any lavish
wasting or mispence of the public treasure, it had been fit they should have
mentioned it, otherwise they deal unjustly and injuriously with us, to expect
we should provide for their peace and safety, and yet deny us the means
whereby we should accomplish it. 6thly, For illegal committments, their
complaint pretends frequencie, otherwise it were not a public grievance,
therefore we conceive they might have produced some clear instances in this
kind. But let them bring forth one: Or let them charge any of the courts or
magistrates with corruption in their places, or manifest injustice in their
sentences: Or the government with allowance of any thing that is morally evil.
If not; they are impudent slanderers, and deeply guilty of the breach of the
5th commandment which (without serious repentance) God will require of them.
7thly, These remonstrants would be thought to be a representative part of all
the non-freemen in the country; but when we have pulled off their vizards, we
find them no other but Robert Child, Thomas Foul, etc. For first, although
their petition was received with all gentleness, yet we hear of no other
partners that have appeared in it, though it be four months since it was
presented. Again, we know that diverse of the non-freemen have lived some in
Virginia and other plantations, where the government has not been so easy to
them as they have found it here. Others have lived in Kent, under the laws of
Gavelkind, more repugnant to the common laws of England than any of ours.
Others have had to do in maritime affairs; others in causes testamentrie and
matrimonial; others in the chancery, and others in London and other
corporations, and so have found by experience that Englishmen may live
comfortably and securely under some other laws besides the common and statute
laws of England; and that all the privilege of a freeborne English subject is
his interest in the laws, without right of election of public officers, which
they were never acquainted with there, and yet paid their equal proportions to
all public charges, etc. These non-freemen also are well satisfied (as we
conceive) and do bless God for the blessings and privileges they do enjoy
under this government. They think it is well, that justice is equally
administered to them with the freemen; that they have equal share with them in
all town lotts, commons, etc. that they have like liberty of access to the
church assemblies, and like place and respect there, according to their
qualities, as also in all neighbourly meetings for maintenance of love, as also
like freedom of trade and commerce. So that we have good cause to be
persuaded, that there are not many of these discontented remonstrants within
our jurisdiction, nor in New England. We are further confirmed herein, when we
consider what hard shifts these remonstrants were put unto, to make up the
number of seven. The first (and he that must (ducem agere in hujus militiae) be
the leader in this design) is a Paduan Doctor (as he is reputed) lately come
into the country, who has not so much as tasted of their grievances, nor like
to do, being a batchelour and only a sojournour, who never paid penny to any
public charge, though (of his own good will) he has done something for
public use. A second, is a church member, but will be no freeman; he likes
better to be cased of that trouble and charge. A third, is a freeman, but no
member of any church, and the reason has been his professed affection to the
hierarchy. A fourth, is a clarke of the prothonotaries office, a sojournour
also, and of no visible estate in the country, one who has never appeared
formerly in such design, however he has been drawn into this; it is like to
be as those who were called by Absalom to accompany him to Hebron. A fifth, is
a young merchant, little acquainted with commonwealth affairs. We are willing
to suppose he might also be one of them, who were invited by Absalom to Hebron,
but sure we are, it is no small grief to his honored godly friends to find
him there, when they prayed and waited daily to hear of him in Jerusalem. A
sixth was taken up by accident, being none of this jurisdiction, but himself
and family inhabiting at Rhode Island. The seventh, is an old grocer of
London, whose forgetfulness of the laws and customs of that city, and
unmindfullnes of his duty to the government under which he now lives and
prospers, we may impute to his age and some other infirmities. And these are
the champions who must represent the body of non-freemen. If this be their
head, sure they have (insulsum caput et non multo sale defaecandum) an
unsavory head, not to be seasoned with much salt. It may be thought rather
that this was some dareing business at some of their merry-meetings, like that
of Sir Roger Williams and the Dutch commander Skencke, who in a vyeing bravery
would adventure to fetch the prince of Parma out of his tent in the midst of
his army.

Thus have we traced our remonstrants through the civil state, wherein it was
easy to follow them by their ill scent; they are now passing over to the
church, but in their way they will needs observe some notable decay of trade
and husbandry, etc. and withal some malignant and noisome diseases among us,
and they are bold to deliver Gods council therein without consulting with his
oracles, where they might have learned that all things come alike to all, and
as many as I love I rebuke and chastise, and judgment must begin at the house
of God (and how then must malignants speed) So as their imputeing such
afflictions to the evil of our government is without rule, nor do they deal
faithfully in their discovery. For although our merchants have sustained some
late losses at sea in two or three voyages, yet we have no cause to murmr at
the good providence of the Lord, who has well repaired those losses by his
blessing upon us in our fishing and other tradeing abroad, and by the success
he has given to our labors at home, so as we could spare twenty thousand
bushells of corn the last year (so much at least being transported) and a
good quantity shipped out already this present year. As for those diseases
they speak of, it is true (and the Lord teach us to profitt thereby) God was
pleased to visit some of our towns the last spring with a more violent fever
than ordinary, whereby (as we guess) some fifty or sixty persons were taken
away in a few weeks; but when we consider the nature and strength of the
disease, and the weakness of the means for prevention or cure, we must
acknowledge it a singular testimony of fatherly love, that among so many
thousands he took away so few, and stayed it so suddenly. And for that
shameful disease they mention, we may see how ready they are to publish any
thing to our disgrace. They might have covered this blemish, being the first of
this kind that we have known in the country, and no guilt thereof lyeing upon
the government, or upon the country that we can find. There came indeed the
last year out of England a lewd person infected with the French disease, who
stayed not long with us; but since his departure some others have been
infected, but by what means we cannot find; the infection spreading by a work
of charity, in drawing the breasts of one infected, but neither known to them
nor to herself, that we can learn. But this was more observable (wherein the
remonstrants might have seen the good hand of the Lord toward us) that a
stranger coming accidentally into the country at that time, who had special
skill in that disease, through the blessing of God, soon cured them.

These remonstrants are now come to the church door, when one of their
company gives them the flipp, not dareing (it seems) to enter for fear of an
admonition. But let us see what exceptions the other side have to our churches,
etc. They tell us, that diverse sober, righteous, and godly men, eminent for
knowledge and other gracious gifts of the Holy Spirit, no ways scandalous in
their lives, are detained from the seals, because (as is supposed) they will
not take these churches covenant. The petitioners are sure mistaken or
misrepresent the matter; for the true reasons why many persons in the country
are not admitted to the seals are these. First, many are fraudulous in their
conversation; or 2dly, notoriously corrupt in their opinions; or 3dly, grossly
ignorant in the principles of religion; or 4thly, if any have such knowledge
and gifts, yet they do not manifest the same by any public profession before
the church or before the elders, and so it is not known that they are thus
qualified. And our churches may not receive men blind-foulded, or upon other
men's creditt, when they shall refuse to give account of their faith or
repentance, which is so expressly required, 1 Pet. 3.15. Matt. 3.6. Acts 8.37.
Matt. 16.16, 17, 18. Few examples (if any) can be given of such as have
manifested themselves to be so qualified and yet have been refused merely for
scrupleing the covenant. And it is justly questionable whether such should be
admitted to the seals, who will not be subject to the discipline appointed by
Christ in his churches. For what is the covenant but a submitting themselves
under the ordinances of Christ, as the same are exercised according to the rule
of the word, in that church where such an one joins as a member? Let a man
professedly engage himself hereto, and (we suppose) our churches will rest
satisfied therewith. Our churches are not alone, nor the first that have walked
in this way. The like course is held in the French and Dutch churches, and
allowed by some of the chief patrons of the presbyterian way: As Mr.
Rathbeard, Nar. p. 16. Mr. Rutterford, Due Right, etc. p. 85, 86, 88. Who do
grant, that when a member is admitted, etc. there is always an implicit
covenant (at least) which be now comes under. And if so, then what burden or
danger can there be to any christians conscience, in expressing that by his
words, which he must acknowledge and binds himself unto by his action? unles
plain and open dealing be grown unlawful. They say they see no light in Gods
word for such a covenant, which may well be; for it appears by other passages
in their remonstrance, that they have small acquaintance therewith, or else
like not to come under the power of it. And it appears also, by the offense
they take, to be compelled to attend to it in the public assemblies. They
profess to approve of the covenant lately imposed by the honorable houses of
parliament, and that they are all of them very willing to take such oaths and
covenants as are expressions of their desires of advanceing the glory of God
and good of this place, etc. and yet they boggle at the covenants of these
churches, which are wholely framed according to the same description. So as it
is clear, it is not want of light (as they pretend) but something in their
own hearts, which they seek to cover. For let them stand to that profession,
and they can never stick at our covenants. And whereas they say they cannot
perceive what our covenants are, because they are not one and the same in every
church; they might as well say, they could not understand our prayers and
sermons, because they differ also one from another in form of words. For the
difference of our covenants in the several churches is no other. In substance
(for ought we know) they all agree. And what ever the several expressions may
be, this suffices us (which we conceive to be intended by them all) that in
this covenant we profess our engagement of relation to God, and one to
another, in all the duties which belong to the public worship of God, and
edification one of another, according to the rule of the gospel.

Another matter which troubles them is, that they are compelled (under a severe
fine) every Lords day to appear at the congregation. The law which they
account so severe is this: Any two assistants may fine or imprison such persons
inhabiting here, as shall usually absent themselves from church meetings upon
the Lords day, so as the fine exceed not 5 s. for one offense. We cannot
conceive that such sober and godly men as these remonstrants speak of, should
fear any hurt by this law, for sure such persons need not to be compelled to
resort to church meetings. Therefore it should seem rather, that they would
plead for liberty for loose and irreligious persons, or for such as are
tainted with such corrupt opinions as do cause them to cast off all public
ordinances of Gods worship, or else they would not have the civil authority
to meddle with men, for matters of the first table; and so they would have the
4th commandment to be ceremonial, which expressly requires that all within our
gates be looked unto, that they do not violate the Lords sabbath, but sanctify
it. And if they would have all men admitted to the seals of Gods covenant,
they must either allow they may be brought to the ordinary means of
instruction, whereby they may be made fit for the same; or else they confess
against themselves that they would have them admitted in their ignorance and
profanenes.

They are offended also at our law against Anabaptists. The truth is, the
great trouble we have been putt unto and hazard also, by familisticall and
anabaptisticall spirits, whose conscience and religion has been only to set
forth themselves and raise contentions in the country, did provoke us to
provide for our safety by a law, that all such should take notice, how
unwelcome they should be unto us, either comeing or staying. But for such as
differ from us only in judgment, in point of baptism or some other points of
less consequence, and live peaceably amongst us, without occasioning
disturbance, etc. such have no cause to complain; for it has never been as
yet putt in execution against any of them, although such are known to live
amongst us.

Another of their grievances is, that in some places they are forced to
contribute to the maintenance of those ministers who vouchsafe not to take them
into their flock. They do well to restrain this grievance to some places;
for it is well known, that in many of our churches no such course is used. And
sure we are, that none of these remonstrants were ever compelled so such
contribution. And although the scripture says the labourour is worthy of his
wages, yet there are amongst us some, who live under the ministry of the word,
themselves and their families, year after year, and yet never contribute the
worth of one penny to the maintenance thereof, though they have place in the
assembly equal to any of their rank, and though the wives of some of them
do communicate at the Lords table, and their children are received to
baptism. And whereas they complain that they are not accounted so much as
brethren, nor publicly so called. The truth is, we account all our countrymen
brethren by nation, and such as in charity we may judge to be believers are
accounted also brethren in Christ. If they be not publicly so called
(especially in the church assemblies) it is not for want of due respect or good
will toward them, but only for distinction sake, to putt a difference between
those that do commuicate together at the Lords table, and those who do not.
As for that complaint of want of exercising christian vigilancie toward them,
it is a most untrue and unjust charge. For it is evident in most places (and
for ought we know) in all, that besides the public prayers and instructions
which is common to them with the members of the church, they are admitted (such
as will) to private conference and prayers; they are visited in times of
sickness, etc. as occasion requires. If any faileing be in particular members in
this kind, it is against the mind of the churches and the intent of the civil
government. If some duties of church discipline are not exercised toward them,
they can blame none but themselves, in that they refuse to submitt themselves
thereto.

Concerning the baptism of the children of such as are not members of our
churches, there is an assembly of the elders now in being, and therefore we
think fit to deferr any resolution about that and some other points
concerning the church discipline, until we shall understand their conclusion
therein, for further light in these things.

In their conclusion, these remonstrants prognosticate what peace and
felicity we may certainly expect both in church and common wealth, if their
petition be granted, viz. that every man be left to his own liberty, and no
distinctions or qualifications observed, etc. which they might have illustrated
by some examples, which we marvel they omitted, especially having one so
near and fresh; we shall therefore help their memory. They well know that
some eight years since, here were a certain company (which were petitioners
and remonstrants also though in another kind) who out of their tenderness of
liberty of conscience, and civil liberty withal, made great disturbance
both in church and civil state, but not obtaineing their desire, and fearing
such a ruin to come upon us as these remonstrants foresee, they removed to
Rhode Island, where having given equal privilege to all and established this
as their basis, etc. that no man should ever be molested for professing his
judgment, etc. they thought themselves the only happy concording people under
heaven. But, alas! it was but a dream; it was not of God and therefore could
not stand. For this liberty and equallity so fomented natural corruption, as
they presently fell at variance among themselves, and grew into three or four
opposite parts, which continue to this day; and instead of establishing church
and civil state have overthrown both.

Such peace, unity, prosperity, etc. is that which we may expect, if we will
cast off the rules of Gods word, the civil prudence of all nations, and our
own observation of the fruit of other men's follies, and hearken to the
counsel of these new statesmen. From which the Lord deliver us, and all the
seed of Israel to the comeing of Christ Jesus. AMEN.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Symonds to Governor Winthrop, Jan. 6. 1646.
Sir,
I Thank you for the intelligence you sent me before the fast day. I am sorry
for the trouble you were put unto. Troubles and difficulties we must look for
(if we will reere a building to the Lord) but the encouragement exceeds when we
consider the work is his. I am informed that coppies of the petition are
spreading here, and diverse (specially young men and women) are taken with it,
and are apt to wonder why such men should be troubled that speak as they do;
not being able suddenly to discern the poison in the sweet wine, nor the fire
wrapped up in the straw. And allbeit I do conceive this town Ipswich.
affords very few malignants, yet withal I doubt not but here are some active
spirits for any such project once set on foot. I am informed of the
suspicious expressions here and there of some, but I shall attend full matter,
and the fittest season, before I think meet to meddle with them. I perceive
that our people here when through the cunning of some and mistake of others,
any doubts concerning the public proceedings are in minds, they are soon
satisfied when they are rightly informed. Upon these and such like
considerations I do desire you would hasten the sending of a copy of the
courts answer to the petition and remonstrance, also of the charge of their
answer thereunto, and also of a reply (if any be made unto it) if none be
made, then a copy of the reply to their answer in the first particular, which
I suppose is with the rest in Mr. Secretaries hands. If it be not too much
trouble to you I should desire now and then a few lines from you how matters
proceed at the Bay. Its none of the least point of the petitioners policy to
bear people in hand of multitudes to be of their mind; but its conceived that
its a mere empty vant, for except a few (not affected to religion, and others
erroneous in opinions) the people are firm.

Yours in him who ever watches over us, S. S.
6th 11th, 46. I Had ended as you see what I intended at this time, but it
being still in my hand I thought good to add a little more. The scope of what I
would express is, to observe Gods providence in man's motions at this time
seem plainly to tend to settle his people here, and to recover new English
spirit for Christ's kingdom again. The irregular departure of some causes a
deeper search of heart, wherefore God has brought his people hither, (I will
briefly mention Gods ends, as I conceive them, by and by) and the plotting of
others under the alluring notion of liberty, thereby to win the opinionists
and looser sort, causes the solid christians to prize the rare and rich liberty
which God has given them, and they have deerly purchased, (viz. in respect of
men in this their great adventure) at a very high rate. Is not government in
church and common weal (according to Gods own rules) that new heaven and
earth promised, in the fullnes accomplished when the Jews come in, and the
first fruits begun in this part New England, though neglected by many and
opposed by some? Now to name what seems to be Gods end in bringing his people
hither, whatever more there may be which time may yet discover.

1. To be an occasion to stir up the zeal of the two nations to set upon
reformation of religion, and that with good success.

2. To have liberty and power to set up Gods own ordinances in church
government, and thereby to hold forth matter of conviction to the episcopacy
and others that this way of church government and civil government may stand
together.

3. To exercise the graces of the richer sort in a more mixed condition, they
shall have the liberty of good government in their hands, yet with the
abatement of their outward estates. And that the poorer sort (held under in
England) should have enlargement.

4. To afford a hiding place for some of his people that stood for the truth
while the nation was exercised unto blood.

5. To have an opportunity to train up a godly skillfull soldiery, which
shortly may be employed against that blasphemous city. And to these may be
added (at least a sprinkling) of godly seamen, formerly rare in the world.

6. To make this place a rendezvous for our dear English friends when they
shall make their voyages to the West Indies, to dry up that Euphrates.

7. To be hopeful instruments in Gods hand to gain these Indians to Christ's
kingdom. Which mercy if attained in any considerable measure will make us go
singing to our graves.

I will also mention the text preached upon at our last fast, and the
propositions raised thereupon, because it was so seasonable to New-Englands
condition, and so prosecuted, that did you see a copy I think you would
desire the sermon to be set forth in printe for public advantage.

Jeremy 30.17. For I will restore health to thee, and heal thee of thy wounds,
says the Lord: because they called thee an outcast, saying, this is Zion whom
noe man cares for.

1. Prop. That sick times do pass over Zion.

2. That sad and bitter neglect is the portion and aggravation and affliction
of Zion in the time of its sickness and wounds, but specially in the neglect of
those that do neglect it, and yet notwithstanding do acknowledge it to be
Zion.

3. That the season of penitent Zions passion is the season of God's compassion.

This sermon tended much to the settling of godly minds here in Gods way, and
to raise their spirits, and as I conceive has suitable effects.

I think the magistrates, etc. may justly long for a happy conclusion of the
Synod, that they may attest to the government of Christ in his church, and that
they may with renewed vigor attend the mighty providence in these times and
opportunities for the advance of Christ's cause, the elders being so zealously
set thereupon.

Sir, its conceived this place will prove either very honorable or very meene
and contemptable, according as religion is attended or neglected.

If you think it meet, I pray send also a copy of their petition found in
Dands studdy, its directed to the commissioners.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Richard Vines This Mr. Vines had been many years an
agent for Sir Ferdinando Gorges in his Province of Main.
to Governor Winthrop.
Right Worshipful and ever honored Sir,
I Undertake not to give you a relation of this island, presuming you know
more thereof than I can express. But my real respects to your worthyness
enjoyne me to salute you with a line or two, not only to show my gratefulnes
for former favors, but still desiring to keep correspondency with you who have
always respected me beyond my deserts. I shall be joyful you had any service
here to command me, to make good my poor expressions in real actions.

This gentleman, Mr. John Mainford merchant, is coming to your port to trade
for provisions for the belly, which at present is very scarce, by reason of 5
or 6 months daythe, and not that only, but men are so intent upon planting
sugar that they had rather buy food at very dear rates than produce it by
labor, so infinite is the profitt of sugar works after once accomplished. I
have by Gods assistance settled my self in two plantations adjoining,
containing 50 acres, the which I hope after 6 months will maintain me and mine
comfortably, besides my practice of physic which is worth at least 10000lb. of
tobacco per ann. declare, yett, it is hard with me by reason of my great
payments for my plantations and negroes and other necessary disbursments
already paid to the value of 40000 lb. of tobacco, which keeps me bare at
present; I doubt not but the next crop (proving well) but to be better able to
live than I have been many years.

Mr. Parker with his wife and family are well seated in a good plantation of 20
acres, besides a good stipend and many good gifts, well approved of in his
function, opposed by none, unless by antinomians and such like. I bless God
my family continue in good health, all liking the island well, notwithstanding
their change of dyett, which at present is but slender, yet far from want. I
fear not but within 6 months to live as plentifully as any man upon this
island, according to my proportion. I have at present 16 accres of cotton
planted at the least, as much corn for my provisions, bysides tobacco. The
next year I intend for sugar, at present I cannot. Thus ceasing farther to
trouble you, save with my respective service to yourselfe, your virtuous wife,
with your sons and daughters, and to the reverend divines Mr. Cotton and Mr.
Wilson, to my worthy friends Maj. Gibbons and Mr. Hill, leaving you all to
Israells protector, resting

Your assured friend and servant, Rich. Vines.
Barbados, July 19th, 1647.
Mr. Richard Vines's Letter to Governor Winthrop, about the Sickness in
Barbados.
Barbados, 29th April, 1648. Right worshipful, and my ever honored friend,
YOUR kind letter of the 24th of August I received, which was most welcome
unto me, esteeming it a high favor that you will vouchsafe to keep
corespondency with so undeserving a friend. I perceive by your letter that the
Lord did shake his rod over New England, it was his great mercy only to put
you in remembrance. We have felt his heavy hand in wrath, and yet I fear not
sensible of it, for here is little amendment, or notice taken of his great
punishments. The sickness was an absolute plague; very infectious and
destroying, in so much that in our parish there were buried 20 in a week, and
many weeks together, 15 or 16. It first seized on the ablest men both for
account and ability of body. Many who had begun and almost finished great
sugar works, who dandled themselves in their hopes, but were suddenly laid in
the dust, and their estates left unto strangers. Our New England men here had
their share, and so had all nations especially Dutchmen, of whom died a great
company, even the wisest of them. The contagion is well nigh over, the Lord
make us truly thankful for it and ever mindful of his mercy. I saw your son
here, he made but little stay, but went for Christophers with his cargo; he is
a very hopeful gentleman. If the Lord please to send him here again or any
other of your sons, I shall be ready to serve them in what I may. I here the
Lord has graciously recompensed your incomparable loss with another most
virtuous and loving wife, many and happy be your days together.

Sir, I shall take it as a great blessing from God to give me a good occasion
to serve you or any of your children, here or else where, that I might exercise
my thankful remembrance for all former courtesies.

No more at present but my humble service to yourselfe and virtuous wife, and
to all your sons and daughters. Committing you all to the protection of
almighty God.

Ever resting your assured loving friend, and servant, Rich. Vines.
I pray Sir be pleased to present my best Service to Mr. Dudley, Mr.
Bellingham, Mr. Stibbins, and the two reverend ministers Mr. Cotton and Mr.
Wilson.



Copy of a Letter from William Coddington to Governor Winthrop.
Right worshipful and beloved in our Lord Jesus,
I Do rejoice in the Lords mercey, grace and favor to you, in bestoweing of
you a meet helper, and now again establishing you a governor over his people.
Sir, this bearer, Capt. Partridge, has requested me to signify to you what I
know concerneing Robt. Nashes dealeings with him, viz. he sold him some fatt
cattle in August last at an under raite, to be paid in bever, he has deferred
him from time to time, and the last time I was in the Bay promised him before
me, if he had it not to return by that ship he would give him double the value
(which he does not stand upon) and now is forced to seek his own. I doubt not
you will be pleased to afford him that justice as the equity of his cause may
require. Sir, this bearer and Mr. Balstone, and some others of this island, are
in disgrace with the people in Providence, Warwick and Gortons adherents on the
island, for that we will not enterposse or meedle at all in their quarrills
with the Massachusetts and the rest of the colonyes; and do much fear that
Gorton will be a thorn in their and our sides, if the Lord prevent not; but I
hope shortly to see you, and to speak with you, and therefore shall for the
present sease from writeing, but not from remayneing

Newport, May 25. 1648. Yours ever, Wm. Coddington.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Hopkins Mr. Hopkins was Governor of Connecticut.
Soon after this Letter he went to England, was promoted by Cromwell, made a
Commissioner of the Navy and of the Admiralty, and died there in 1657.
to Governor Winthrop.
Much honored Sir,
I Received yours of the 26th past, and have much cause to acknowledge your
great love in the pains you took to answer my desire in the case propounded.
I find a general concurrence almost, with your thoughts therein, by all I have
consulted with, so that I dare not, having such a stream of advice to the
contrary, resolve to return, until more of the mind of the Lord appear that
way, though I find not my heart so quieted in that determination as I hoped it
would. Your prayers I nead and beg, that that the Lord would at length satisfy
me with himself in this sad and great trial which almost overwhelmes my
spirit.

I hoped ere this to have received from you Mr. Bradfords resolution concerning
meeting Mons. Stuyvesant The Dutch Governor of the New-Netherlands now New York.
here. You will understand by my father Eatons former letters to yourselfe,
that his thoughts inclyne to alter the commissioners meeting from Plymouth to
this place for this year, if our friends at Plymouth be content therewith. I
much desire to understand the issue of your thoughts there, that occasions may
be ordered accordingly, and the Dutch governor have notice in seasonable time
of the meeting. We are much engaged to your love in the ready willingness you
express to undergo so great a journey upon the service of our peace. The good
Lord answer the holy endeavors of his servants with answerable success, and
grant us his peace in all things by all means. I have noe more time at present
but to scribble these few lines in much haste and to subscribe myself

Yours by many engagements ready to serve you in what I may, E. Hopkins.
Hartford, 21st June, 1648.
Application from Rhode Island to the Commissioners of the United Colonies and
their Answer.
MR. William Coddington and Capt. Partridge of Roade-Island presented this
request to the Commissioners in writeing. Our request and motion is in the
behalf of our island, that we the Islanders of Roade-Island may be received
into a combination with all the united colonies of New England, into a firm
and perpetual league of friendship and amity, for offense and defense,
mutual advice and succor, upon all just occasions, for our mutual safety and
welfare, and for preserving of peace amongst ourselves, and preventing, as much
as may be, all occasions of war or differences, and to this our motion we
have the consent of the major part of our island.

William Coddington, Alexander Partridge,


To which motion the Commissioners returned this answer under their hands.
Mr. Coddington and Capt. Partridge,
THE Commissioners for the united Colonies have considered what you have
propounded, either by speech or writeing, and find your present state and
condition full of confusion and danger, having much disturbance amongst
yourselves, and no security from the Indians, they desire therefore in
several respects to afford both advice and help. But upon perusal of the
ancient patent granted to New Plymouth, they find Road Island (upon which your
plantations are settled) to fall within their line and bounds, which the
honorable Committee of Parliament think not fit to streighten or infringe,
nor may we. If therefore yourselves and the inhabitants, or the most
considerable parts of them, upon a due consideration of Plimouths patent and
right, acknowledge yourselves within that jurisdiction, we shall consider and
advise how you may be accepted upon just terms, and with tender respect to
your conveniencie, and shall after afford you the same advice, protection and
help which other plantations within the united Colonies enjoy, which we hope in
sundry respects may tend to your comfort and safety.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Symonds to Governor Winthrop, about the Synod.
Sir,
I Understand it is your purpose to vizitt us and afford your presence this
court; pray let no small matter deprive us of our desire and expectation; and
we should be glad to see Mrs. Winthrop here (if with convenience it might be)
And I pray bring with you a copy of the vote of the Synod concerning the
confession (not of discipline) but of doctrine and faith; which you may have, I
suppose, of Mr. Cotton, Mr. Elyott, or of Mr. Allen of Dedham, if your man ask
for it. Thus with our best respects presented I rest

Yours ever, S. Symonds.

Copy of a Letter from Edward Winslow, Esquire to the Commissioners of the United
Colonies.
Gentlemen,
REeceaving a letter from you, notwithstanding the large letter sent by the
corporation to yourselves, I cann do no less than give you thanks for your
respect therein to myself, and care of me, least I might sink under the
pressure of following the public business at my private charge, the time is not
as yet come for me to expect any relief, there being very little of the
collections come into the treasury, more than what has been expended in
printing, etc. and paying Mr. Jenners library, which I desire may be looked
after according to the cattalogue sent over. For his necessities pressed us to
a present disbursement of thirty pounds, and to recover it again would be a
hard matter, yea too hard for us, he living in Norfolk; but a word is
sufficient, it is better to loose some than all. I shall speedily write to Mr.
Weld and acquaint him also with the readiness that is in the corporation to pay
the thirty four pounds to him also (having order so to do) for his library
left with Mr. Elliott, so that I trust that gapp will be soon stopped. The
collection is hopefully begun in London, and I believe will arise to a
considerable some, but you would wonder to hear the several sorts of
objections that are made against it by men that after all are ashamed to
neglect it, as what have we to do to raise great sumes to promote the gospel
among naked people, the gospel is going away from us, and we help it forward,
we have more need to support learning at home then abroad; and then our
levellers will have nothing to do to advance humane learning, there is too
much of it already; and yett notwithstanding it goes hopefully on, etc.
Yesterday (as I am informed) Mr. Coddington He was in England soliciting for
powers of Government for Rhode Island.
had something done for him at the counsel of state, which I believe was his
pattent confirmed, for the truth is since I perceaved by letters from Plymouth
that after another years warning nothing is likely to be done in reference to
the old order of lords and commons sent over in (47) as I take it I looked upon
it as a vain thing to strive against the stream, when as indeed that was the
maine matteriall objection above a twelve month since, which I could not
answer, that we had such an order but never looked after the performance
thereof, nor made any return upon it, and if I could not then answer it, how
much less now after another year, if not eighteen months expiration, but the
will of the Lord must be done; however I suffer in my reputation here, to make
so great a bustle forced, and then to let all fall at last; had I not had
particular instructions from Plymouth herein I had never stirred in it, but I
shall be more warey hereafter how I engage in business of that nature, yet when
I have said it, shall not dare to neglect the least service wherein any or all
the united colonies are concerned. Here is a great murmuring at the great
provisions of powder and shot the several ships get license for, year
after year, 40 barrells of powder and 50 barrells is an ordinary proportion to
a shipp, nay sometimes 100, and lead and arms proportionable. Its laid to our
chardge, that being custom free, we enrich ourselves by furnishing Barbados
and Virginia, though enemies, etc. with that and other commodities, and there
has been upon that very account a serious debate about revoking our free
custom and excise. I have labored in it, and satisfied many of the Parliament
and Counsel of State, of your care not to suffer any powder more than ships
store* to be transported away, that we are feign to land all we bring hither
for fear of fireing the ships in the river, and must get license for that
also upon return, that the master is forced to take license for more than he
buys that he may bear out his passengers particular stores. I have showed
them how many ships and their lading we have lost for their sakes by the kings
party, told them what profitts they had by the retournes of New England, for
whether they went for Spain, Streights, Barbados, etc. they all pay custom
and excise home; that we only had suffered with and for them and, for their
sakes, were hated of all the English abroad. This has made a present stopp,
but I assure you it concerns the country to take notice of it and be careful
that our merchants and such as trade thither abuse not the freedom we enjoy,
nor know I better to whom to imparte it than to you the Commissioners that are
the representatives of the united Colonies. I pray God direct you herein,
amongst other the weighty occasions of the country, etc.

Gentlemen, your humble servant, Edw. Winslow.
London, April 17. 51.
The Answer to the foregoing Letter follows.
Honored Sir,
WE have received yours of the 17th of April past, and therein take notice of
your continued respects to this country, and uncessant endeavors for
promoting the welfare of the poor natives; we have also seen the invoyce of
the goods sent, For the use of the Corporation for propagating the Gospel among
the Indians, Mr. Winslow being one of the Members in England.
which as we understand are taken up at Boston according to the tennor of the
bills of lading, and secured by those to whose care you committed them. It is
some disadvantage that the prices of the severalls are not mentioned, which for
future you may please to rectify; we shall endeavor, through the grace of
Christ, that what comes to our hands may be improved to the best advantage of
the work, as it comes under our view; and that such account be kept of the
disposal thereof and returned to you, as may (if not fully answer the
expectation of all who are concerned) yet evidence our faithfullnes in the
trust committed to us. In order whereunto we have deputed Mr. Edward Rawson of
Boston as our steward or agent, to receive what is sent, dispose and keep
accounts of the same, according to such order as he receives from us, and
notice shall be taken, according to your desire, what difference there is in
the proof of the tools now sent; we shall enquire after the catalogue of Mr.
Jenners library, and endeavor that neither your nor our ends may be
frustrated. It is apprehended by some that, according to the intent of the act
of Parliament, an eye may be had in the distributions to the enlardging the
college at Cambridge, whereof is great need, and furtherance of learning not
so immediately respecting the Indian design; though we fully concur not,
yett we desire to know what the apprehensions of the honored Corporation are
herein: If the one might receive some encouragement without prejudice of the
other, we hope the kingdom of our Lord Jesus, the gennerally professed end of
all interested in the work, may be advanced thereby. It has been and is the
great care of the governments in the several colonies, that the immunities
granted by the honorable Parliament Massa Hist. Vol. I. 114.
may not be abused by any of ours, and therein have had a special respect to
the trade of powder; which we cannot but fear has been too exorbitantly
managed, by some, though the welfare of the colonies, in many respects, are
deeply concerned and hazarded; we shall add what strength we may to the fences
already made, that if no other considerations will prevail, selfe-concernment
may deter. Though we have not understood that any from us has been
transported to Barbados or Virginia; the great inconvenience we lie under is
from that mischievous trade of guns, powder, shot, etc. carried on by French,
Dutch, and Swedes, with the Indians, and temptations arising to some of ours
thereby, which has occasioned many to urge a setting open that trade amongst
ourselves, conceiving that (as the case stands) the best way to putt a check to
that current it now runs so strongly in; but we have been slow herein, nor
dare we yett set open such a door, yett could be willing to understand from
you what interpretation you conceive would be made by the state there, if
restreints, upon the aforementioned considerations, should for a time be taken
off. We understand Mr. Eaton Governor of New Haven Colony.
has written to you at large about their just title to considerable parts of
land on both sides of Delaware bay and river, how they were formerly disturbed
in their trade and planting, by force and other unlawful practices both of
Dutch and Swedes, yourselfe may remember; and he has acquainted you with a
late unneighbourly and injurious carriage of the Dutch Governor, when at least
50 of New Haven jurisdiction were on their way to plant there, but were stayed,
imprisoned and forced to return with great loss to those interrested in that
design, and has desired your help in procuring a patent. These things, by a
petition from these concerned in the late loss and disappointment, have been
recommended to our consideration. We are justly sensible of the dishonor putt
upon the English nation by this unjust affront, of our duty to preserve the
English title to so considerable a place as Delaware, and that a just repair
and satisfaction be made to those so wronged both in their persons and estates
and, from you, desire information what esteem the old pattents for that place
have with the Parliament or Counsel of State, where there has been no
improvement hitherto made by the pattentees; whether the Parliament has
granted any late pattents, or whether in granting they reserve not liberty
and encouragement for such as have or shall plant upon their formerly duly
purchased lands; as also how any engagement by the colonies against the Dutch
upon the forementioned occasion will be resented by the Parliament, of which we
desire information by the first, etc.

Your loving friends.
Newhaven, 11. September, 1651.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Cotton to Lord General Cromwell.
Right Honorable,
FOR so I must acknowledge you, not only for the eminency of place and command
which the God of power and honor has called you unto; but also for that the
Lord has sat you forth as a vessel of honor to his name, in working many and
great deliverances for his people, and for his truth, by you; and yet helping
you to reserve all the honor to him, who is the God of salvation, and the Lord
of hoasts, mighty in battle. I am not ignorant that you suffer no small
dishonor in the tongues of many, not only as a sectary, but as out of your
calling, being sat on work (as is pretended) by an usurped power, and
yourselfe (with the army) exercising a power destructive in some cases to the
privileges of parliament, and the liberty and safety of the kingdom. But 3 or
4 principles there be, upon which it seems to me your proceedings have been
grounded and carried on, and whein my judgment (reasonable it is) has been
fully satisfied: 1. That the concessions of the late king never came up to such
a posture as whereon to lay a firm foundation of a safe peace, either to
church or commonwealth. 2. That when the Parliament was full, and assisted with
the commissioners of Scotland (in the treaty at Uxbridge or Newport, or
elsewhere) they agreed together that the king could not be restored to his
former state upon such terms. And therefore (unles his concessions afterward
in the Isle of Wight were more safe and satisfactory) This is expressed very
cautiously.
if the Parliament of England voted the contrary afterward, in a mighty
consultation, it was not an act of Parliament, but a praevarication of a former
just and lawful act. And therefore, when the army discerned, not only their
own safetyes, but the safety of religion and state, and their cause and
victoryes given in defense thereof, all of them given away in that
praevarication, I know not how they could have approved their faithfulness
better to the state and cause, then by purging the Parliament of such corrupt
humors, and presenting the king to public trial. 3. That the army, though
they be inferior and subordinate to the state that gives them commission and
pay; yet neither their consciences nor services are mercenary, though they do
receive wages for their support in the service; though soldiers may take oaths
of fidelity to the state, in undertaking an expedition, yet they, regarding the
cause as well as the persons that set them on work, do perform their
fidelity, if they attend to the cause for which they fight, rather than to the
private ends or lusts of such as send them forth. Joab (the general of David's
host) though he went beyond his commission in putting Absalom to death, yet
not beyond his fidelity. 4. That when covenants are plighted, which consist of
many articles (some principal and fundamental, others subordinate and
accessory) if it so fall out that all the articles cannot be performed without
breach of some or other, there may be just cause of repenting the undertaking
of such covenants; but yet, if some articles cannot be performed without breach
of others, the covenanters must chiefly attend to the performance of the
principal articles, though (with grief) they be put to it to violate the
subordinate. These things are so clear to mine own apprehension, that I am
fully satisfied, that you have all this while fought the Lords battles, and
the Lord has owned you, and honored himself in you, in all your expeditions,
which makes my poor prayers the more serious and faithful and affectionate
(as God helps) in your behalf. In like frame (as I conceive) are the spirits
of our brethren (the elders and churches of these parts) carried forth, and the
Lord accept us, and help you in Christ.

If you ask upon what structure I have made thus bold to address myself in
these rude lines to your Lordship, I must acknowledge it is abhorrent from my
native bashfullnesse to run into the presence of great men: But I received the
other day a letter from my reverend brother Mr. Hooker of Newhaven, who
certifyeth me that your Lordship made special mention of me in your late
letters to him, with tender of loving and more respectfull salutations than I
could expect; withal he moved me to write to your Lordship, as believing you
would accept the same in good part. This is my excuse, such as it is.

The Scots, whom God delivered into your hands at Dunbarre, and whereof sundry
were sent hither, we have been desirous (as we could) to make their yoke easy.
Such as were sick of the scurvy or other diseases have not wanted physic and
chyrurgery. They have not been sold for slaves to perpetual servitude, but for
6 or 7 or 8 years, as we do our own; and he that bought the most of them (I
hear) builds houses for them, for every 4 an house, lays some acres of
ground thereto, which he gives them as their own, requiring 3 days in the
week to work for him (by turns) and 4 days for themselves, and promises,
as soon as they can repay him the money he laid out for them, he will set them
at liberty.

As for the aspersion of factious men, I hear, by Mr. Desboroughs letter last
night, that you have well vindicated yourselfe therefrom by cashiering sundry
corrupt spirits out of the army. And truly, Sir, better a few and faithful,
than many and unsound. The army on Christ's side (which he makes victorious)
are called chosen and faithful, Rev. 17.14. a verse worthy your Lordships
frequent and deep meditation. Go on therefore (good Sir) to overcome yourselfe
(Prove. 16.32.) to overcome your army, (Deuteronomy. 29.9, with v. 14.) and to
vindicate your orthodoxe integrity to the world.

Pardon, I beseech you, my boldness and rudeness, which not arrogance but due
respect and observancy to your Lordship has put upon me.

The Lord Jesus who is your righteousness go before you, and the glory of the
Lord be still your rearward, Isai. 58.8. Thus humbly taking leave, I remain,

desirous of the accomplishment of the Lords work in your hands, John Cotton.

Copy of a Letter from Lord General Oliver Cromwell to Mr. John Cotton.
Worthy Sir, and my christian friend,
I Received yours a few days sithence, it was welcome to me, because signed by
you whom I love and honor in the Lord, but more to see some of the same
grounds of our actings stirring in you, that does in us to quiet us to our work
and support us therein, which has greatest difficulty in our engagement in
Scotland, by reason we have had to do with some, who were (I verily think)
godly, but through weakness and the subtilty of Satan, involved in interests
against the Lord and his people: With what tenderness we have proceeded with
such, and that in syncerity, our papers which (I suppose you have seen) will in
part manifest, and I give you some comfortable assurance off. The Lord has
marvelously appeared even against them; and now again when all the power was
devolved into the Scottish King and the malignant party, they invading
England, the Lord has rayned upon them such snares as the enclosed will show,
only the narrative is short in this, that of their whole army, when the
narrative was framed, not five of their whole army were returned. Surely Sir,
the Lord is greatly to be feared, as to be praised, we need the prayers in
this as much as ever. How shall we behave ourselves after such mercy? What is
the Lord a doing? What prophesies are now fulfilling? Who is a God like ours?
to know his will, to do his will are both of him. I took this liberty from
business to salute you thus in a word, truly I am ready to serve you and the
rest of our brethren and the churches with you. I am a poor weak creature and
not worthy the name of a worm, yet accepted to serve the Lord and his people,
indeed my dear friend between you and me you know not me, my weaknesses, my
inordinate passions, my unskilfulness, and every way unfitness to my work,
yet, yet, the Lord who will have mercy on whom he will, does as you see. Pray
for me, salute all christian friends though unknown, I rest

Your affectionate friend to serve you, O. Cromwell.

Protector's own hand. The original Letter was in the possession of Mr.
Middlecot Cook and delivered by him to Mr. Bollan agent for the Massachusetts

printed in Cromwell's life. The Letter from Mr. Cotton to Cromwell I never saw
in print.




Copy of a Letter from Mr. William Arnold to the Governor of Massachusetts.
From Pautuxit this first day of the 7th mo. 1651. Much honored,
I Thought it my duty to give intelligence unto the much honored court of
that which I understand is now working here in these parts. So that if it be
the will of God, an evil may be prevented before it come to too great a head,
viz.

Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Road Island and Conimacucke
Island to himself, he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went
under the name of Providence, because he have gotten away the greater part of
that colonie.

Now these company of the Gortonists that live at Showomut, and that company of
Providence are gathering of 200 L. to send Mr. Roger Williams unto the
Parlyament to get them a charter of these parts, they of Showomut have given
100L. already, and there be some men of Providence that have given 10L. and
20L. a man to help it forward with speed, they say here is a fair inlett,
and I hear they have said, that if the Parlyament do take displeasure against
Massachusitt, or the rest of the colonies, as they have done against Barbadas
and other places, then this will serve for an inroade to let in forces to
over-runne the whole country.

It is great petie and very unfitt that such a company as these are, they all
stand professed enemies against all the united colonies, that they should get a
charter for so small a quantity of land as lies in and about Providence,
Showomut, Pautuxit and Coicett, all which now Road Island is taken out from it,
it is but a strape of land lying in between the colonies of Massachusits,
Plymouth and Conitaquot, by which means, if they should get them a charter,
off it there may come some mischief and trouble upon the whole country if
their project be not prevented in time, for under the pretense of liberty of
conscience about these parts there comes to lieve all the scume the run
awayes of the country, which in time for want of better order may bring a heavy
burden upon the land, etc. This I humbly commend unto the serious
consideration of the much honored court, and rest your humble servant to
command.

William Arnold.
They are making have to send Mr. Williams away.

We that lieve here near them and do know the place and hear their words
and do take notice of their proceeding do know more and can speak more of
what evil may come to the country by their means, then the court do yet
consider off: We humbly desire God their purpose may be frusterated for the
country's peace.

I humbly desire my name may be conceled lest they hearing of what I have
herein written they will be enraged against me and so will revenge themselves
upon me.

Some of them of Showomut that cries out much against them which puts
people to death for witches for say they there be no other witches upon earth
nor devils, but your own pastors and ministers and such as they are, etc.

I understand that there lives a man amongst them that broke prison either at
Conitaquit, or New Haven, he was apprehended for adultery, the woman I hear
was put to death, but the man is kept here in safety in the midest of the
united colonies; it is time there were some better order taken for these
parts, etc.

I have hired this messenger on purpose. I humbly desire to hear if this
letter come safe to your hands.



This Letter appears to be an answer to Proposals made by the French Governor,
first to the Massachusetts afterward to the united Colonies for a free trade
provided the English would join with the French against the Mohawks.
Copy of a Letter from the Commissioners of the United Colonies to the Governor
of Canada.
Most illustrious Sir and much honored Gentlemen,
WE have received your several letters perused your Commissions, presented by
your honored agents, and seriously considered what has been by them either in
writing or conference propounded, concerning those injurious and hostile
attemps made by the Mohawks upon some of your neighboring eastern Indians, of
whom (as we are informed) some are converted to the christian faith, and others
are willing to be taught and may in time prove disciples to our saving Lord and
master, and as such we pity them, but see not how we can protect or afford the
help desired, without exposing the small English plantations and our own
neighboring Indians (of which some also profess christianity) to danger; we
give due creditt to your deputies, and can conceave you may have just ground
for a war, but we have yett no just cause of quarrel with the Mohawkes, nor
is it safe for us to engage in a controversy which we neither do nor have
means satisfyingly to understand, the Mohawkes neither being in subjection to
nor in any confederation with us; we are free to hold a neighborly
correspondency with you, and would have settled a free commerce betwixt the
English and French colonies, but your agents thought it either unseasonable
till matters were composed betwixt the Mohawkes and your Indians, or else
propounded such restrictions as would have taken away all conveniencie and
freedom from the trade. What has hindered our present closing, the enclosed
writing will show, but if a fitter opportunity be offered we shall not be
wanting to contribute to a more satisfying issue. In the mean time we rest.

New Haven, Sept. 6. 51.
An Answer to the Propositions presented by the honored French Agent to the
President and Commissioners for the English united Colonies.
1. UPON due consideration and respect of what the honored deputyes from the
illustrious Governor of New-France have informed and upon experience ourselves
have had of the insolency and treachery of some of the barbarians, we can
conceive and grant, that the French and those eastern Indians may have just
grounds to their own safisfaction, for a war against the Mohawks.

2. The English look upon all such Indians as receive the yoke of Christ with
another eye than upon those that worship the Devil.

3. The English desire by all just means to keep peace (if it may be) with all
men, even with these barbarians.

4. The Mohawkes, living at a distance from the sea, have little intercourse in
these parts, but in the war the English had with the Indians 14 or 16 years
since, the Mohawkes showed a real respect, and have not since done any known
hostile acts against them.

5. The English engage not in any war before they have full and satisfying
evidence, that in all respects and considerations it is just, and before peace
upon just terms has been offered and refused.

6. The Mohawkes are neither in subjection nor league with the English, so that
we can neither require any account of their wars, or other proceedings, nor
have we means to inform ourselves what they can say for themselves.

7. If all other considerations were cleared, to make war with the Mohawkes
may endanger all our neighbor Indians (of which diverse profess christianity)
and the rest do rather expect just protection than that we should expose them,
by our voluntary invading the Mohawkes.

8. Though the English in these jurisdictions are free to perform all
neighbourly offices of righteousness and peace, toward the French collonie,
yet they foresee they can neither permit volunteeres or auxilliary forces to
be taken up against the Mohawkes, nor that the French or eastern Indians pass
through the English jurisdictions, to invade them, but they shall expose both
the christian and other Indians and some of the smaller English plantations to
dainger.

9. The English are much unsattisfied with that mischievous trade the French
and Dutch have had and still continue, selling gunns, powder and shot to all
the Indians, of which we have daily complaints, and by which the Indians are
animated and apt to grow insolent not only against Indian converts and
catechumens, but against the christians of Europe.

10. If the English colonies were assured of the justice of this war, and
engaged with the French to prosecute against the Mohawkes, yet we have no such
short and convenient passage either by water or land to approach them, as may
be had up Hudsons river, to and beyond Aurania forte, which is in the Dutch
jurisdiction.

11. They hope the ancient peace and amitye betwixt England and France will be
continued and confirmed, which they both desire and as far as lies in them
shall by all due means readily promote.

12. They conceave that the honored deputies have power and authority at
present to agree and settle a free commerce between the English and French
colonies in these parts, but if the said deputyes, upon reasons known to
themselves, see cause to limitt the English colonies to such restrictions, or
rather prohibitions as the unpriviledged French are under, that they may not
trade till they have first procured a particular license from the Governor and
Council of New-France, at least till they have issued the present differences
and settled peace with the Mohawkes, a fitter season for these treaties must be
attended, which the Commissioners shall readily improve when it is presented.

The English Colonies, as in the 2d article, are ready upon a fit opportunity
to show all due respect to all truly converted and christian Indians, and much
more than to others, but while they live at such a distance from the English
jurisdictions they neither may promise nor afford them any protection to secure
them from dainger. See Massa. Hist. V. I. p. 166.


Concerning the life of the famous Mr. Cotton, teacher to the church of Christ
at Boston in New England.
WHAT I have to add concerning the life of this blessed man of God now
tryumphing in glory, to what has been already set forth by the reverend Mr.
Davenport, the worthy pastor of the church of Christ at New Haven, I shall hold
forth in these particulars. 1. Concerning the place of his birth and education,
till he went to the university and his abode in Cambridge. 2dly, Concerning his
removal from Cambridge to Boston in Lyncolnshire, and what he met with and did
there. 3dly. Concerning his departure from thence into New England, and what
service the Lord made him an instrument of in that remote country. For the
first,

The place of his birth was the town of Derby, the most eminent place in that
country; his father trained him up to such learning as the school afforded,
for the fitting him for Cambridge, whither he went when he was very young, at
13 years of age, and was admitted into the famous society of Trinity-College,
where he fell so hard to his study, and so profitted in the knowledge of the
tongues and arts that he had undoubtedly been fellow there, but that at that
time their great hall was then in building, which caused such expenses to them
that the election was put by or at least deferred till some longer time. And
this providence I cannot pass by concerning him, that his father (whose
calling was to be employed in the studdy and practice of the law) had not many
clients that made use of his advice in law matters before, it pleased God after
he was gone to Cambridge, to put his father upon great practice, so that he
was very able to keep him there and allow him liberal maintenance; insoemuch
that the blessed man said, God kept me at the university. From Trinity college
he removed to Emanuel college, the happy seminary of learning and piety, where
he was honored with a fellowship in that society, after a diligent and strict
examen, according to the statutes of that house: wherein this is worth the
taking notice of, that when the poser came to examine him in the Hebrew tongue,
the place where he was to be examined was that in Isai. 3. that speaks against
the bravery of women, which has more hard words together than any place in
the Bible within so narrow a compass, and might have posed a very good
Hebrician, but he was very ready at it, and all those difficult words were easy
to him. Afterward he was head-lecturer and dean and catechist in the college,
and was a diligent tutor to many pupills and very much beloved of them: His
exercises that he performed in the college, whether in way of commonplace or
dispute, wanted not sinnewes and strength, were highly commended and applauded
of those that knew him. The first time that he became famous throughout the
whole university, was from a funeral oration which he made in latin for
Doctor Some, who was Master of Peter-house, which was so elegantly and
oratoriously performed that he was much admired for it by the greatest wits in
the university. After that, being called to preach at the university church
called St. Mary's, he was yet more famous for that sermon, and very much
applauded by all the gallant scholars for it: After that, being called to
preach there again, God helped him not to flaunt, as before, but to make a
plain, honest sermon, which was blessed of God to famous Dr. Preston's souls
eternal good: His Concio ad Clerum, when he took his degree for Bachelor of
Divinity, which was after he had been at Boston half a year or more, was
very much admired and applauded more than he desired; his text was out of Math.
5.13. Vos estis sal terrae, quod si sal infatuatus fuerit, quo salietur? In
handling of which, both the matter and the rhetorical streighnes, elegancy of
phrase, and sweet and grave pronunciation rendered him yet more famous in the
university; and so did his answering of the divinity act in the schools,
though he had a very nimble opponent, Mr. William Chapel by name, who disputed
with him.

2dly. Concerning his removal from Cambridge to Boston in Lyncolnshire, this is
to be said, that his call was good, for their desire was urgent, their need
pressed, their assembly of people very great, himself very able, and his heart
inclining to come to them. At his first coming he found some obstruction from
the Bishop of the Diocese, which was B. Barlow, who told him he was a young
man and unfit to be over such a factious people: Mr. Cotton being ingenuous and
undervaluing himself, thought so too, and was purposing to return to the
college again; but some of Mr. Cotton's Boston friends understanding that one
Simon Biby was to be spoken with, which was near the Bishop, Which some called
Simony and Bribery.
they presently charmed him, and so the business went on smooth, and Mr.
Cotton was a learned man with the Bishop, and he was admitted into the place,
after their manner in those days. Well, to Boston the good man came, and for 3
years he preached and lived so amongst them, that they accounted themselves
happy (as they well might) in the enjoyment of him, both the town and country
thereabout being much bettered by him: But it pleased God, after 3 or 4 years
being there, that he could not digest the ceremonies that were so pressed, nor
conformity to them, which in some space of time after bred him trouble in the
court of Lyncolne, from which he was advised to appeal to a higher court, and
employing Mr. Leverit (which was afterward one of the ruling elders of the
church at Boston in N. E.) to deal in that business, and he being a plain
man as Jacob was, yet subtle to get such a spiritual blessing, so far
insinuated himself into one of the proctors of the high court, that he swear
in animam Domini, that Mr. Cotton was a conformable man, and so he was restored
to Boston; as likewise by the means that a gentleman of Boston, called Mr.
Bennet, used to bring him in again: After which he was marvelous successful in
his ministry, till he had been 20 years there, and in that 20 years space,
he on Lord's Day, on afternoones, went over, thrice, the whole body of divinity
in a catechistical way, and gave the heads of his discourse to those that were
young scholars and others in that town, to answer to his questions in
public, in that great congregation, and after their answers he opened those
heads of divinity and sweetly applied all to the edification of his people, and
to such strangers as came to hear him: In the morning on the Lord's Day, he
preached over the first six chapters of the gospel by John, the whole book of
Ecclesiastes, the prophesye of Zephaniah, and many other scriptures, and when
the Lords supper was administered (which was usually every month) he preached
upon 1 Cor. 11. and the whole 30th chapter of the 2 Chronicles. and some other
scriptures about the Lords supper: On his lecture days he preached through the
whole 1st and 2d epistles of John, the whole book of Solomon's song, the
Parables of our Savior set forth in Matthewes gospel to the end of cap. 16.
comparing them with Mark and Luke. He took much pains in private, and read to
sundry young scholars that were in his house, and some that came out of
Germany, and had his house full of auditors. Afterward, seeing some
inconveniences in the peoples flocking to his house, besides his ordinary
lecture on the 5th day of the week, he preached thrice more on the week
days, on the 4th and 6th days, early in the morning, and on the last day at 3
of the clock in the afternoon; only these 3 last lectures were performed by
him but some few years before he had another famous colleague with him, and
not many years before he left Boston: He always preached at the election of
their mayors and at that time when they took their oath and were installed in
their office; and always (if he were at home) at the funerals of those of the
abler sort that died: He was frequent in duties of humiliation and
thanksgiving, in which I have known him in prayer and opening the word and
applying it, 5 or 6 hours, so indefatigable he was in the Lords work, and
so ready to spend and be spent for his peoples souls: He was of admirable
candor, of unparalleled meekness, of rare wisdom, very loving even to those
that differed in judgment from him, yet one that held his own stoutly, arcte
tenens accurateque defendens, what himself judged to be the truth. He answered
many letters that were sent far and near, wherein were handled many difficult
cases of conscience, and many doubts by him cleared, to the greatest
satisfaction. He was exceedingly beloved of the best, and admired and
reverenced of the worst of his hearers. Nothing was wanting to make him a
complete minister, nothing lacking to make him a perfect christian, but the
perfection of grace which he has now attained to, and the glory he has now
arrived at. He was a man that was in great favor with Dr. Williams the Bishop
of Lincoln, who admired him for his learning, and (as I have been told) when
he was lord keeper of the great seal, he went to King James, and speaking of
Mr. Cottons great learning and worth before him, the King was willing,
notwithstanding his nonconformity, to give way that he should have his
liberty, to go on without interruption in his ministry, which was very
marvelous, considering how the Kings spirit was carried out against such men;
the mystery of which Mr. Samuel Ward of Ipswich being ignorant of, spoke
merrily among some of his friends: Of all men in the world I envy Mr. Cotton of
Boston most, for he does nothing in way of conformity, and yet has his
liberty, and I do every thing that way and cannot enjoy mine. He had many
enemies at Boston, as well as many friends, and some that rose up against him
and plotted secretly to undermine him, and others that practiced more openly
against him; but they all of them were blasted, either in their names, or in
their estates, or in their familyes, or in their devices, or else came to
untimely deaths, which shows how God both owned his servant in his holy
labors, and that in the things wherein they dealt proudly against him, he
would be above them.

One thing more, and I have done with him as he was one of Englands gloryes,
and then come to him as over the Atlantique ocean, and in New England, and it
is this; concerning his hospitality, wherein he did exceed most that ever I
heard of, and especially his heart and doors were open to receive (as all that
feared God, so) especially godly ministers, which he most courteously
entertained, and many other strangers besides; only one minister, Mr. Hacket by
name, which had got into the fellowship of famous Mr. Arthur Heildersham, with
many other godly ministers, and being acquainted with their secrets, betrayed
them into the prelates hands; this man coming into Boston and meeting with Mr.
Cotton, the good man had not the heart to speak to him, nor invite him to his
house, which he said he never did to any stranger that he knew before, much
less to any minister.

Concerning the last thing, viz. his departure from Boston to New England. The
times growing perilous, he was envied of some at home and others abroad; and
letters missive were come to convent him before the high-commission-court, and
a profligate fellow and a filthy fornicator, Gowen Johnson by name (who not
long after dyed of the plague) was to bring the letters to him, as he did to
some others near him, which when Mr. Cotton understood, he looked for nothing
from the court but scorns and prison, and therefore with advice from many able
heads and gracious hearts, he kept close for a time, and fitted himself to
go to N. E. and God bringing him and his company over in safety, through his
mercy, after they had been there a while, there grew some trouble between
those that were to settle matters in church and commonwealth, but Mr. Cotton
then preaching before the general court an excellent sermon out of Hag. 2. Be
strong Zerubbabel, and be strong Joshua, and be strong ye people of the land,
etc. it pleased God so to compose and calm and quiet spirits, that all
apprehensions were laid aside, and they went about the work of the Lord very
comfortably and were much encouraged. After which time how useful he was to
England, to New England, to magistrates, ministers, people, in public, in
private, by preachings, counsels, dissolving hard knots, and answering
difficult questions, all knew, that knew the grace of God so evidently
manifested in him. What scriptures he went over on Lords days in expounding
and preaching, I cannot certainly say, because I was of another church, serving
there according to the grace bestowed upon me; but surely he went through very
many, for on his lecture days he preached over the whole book of the
Revelation, Ecclesiastes and Canticles, the 2d and 3d Epistles of John, the 2
Epistles of Timothy, with diverse others, all which shows the unwearied pains
which he took in the Lords work, besides all the books that were written by
him, and other unknown labors that he went through. I could speak much more,
but at this present want strength, but this I say, he may be a pattern to us
all, and happy they that come nearest him, in those things wherein he most
followed Christ. I am not like to live to see such another in N. E. though I
know God is able to double the spirit of that Elias upon him that succeeds him,
and upon many others in our native country and here. It is well for both the
Bostons, that they had such a light, if they walk in the light, and continue
in that word of Christ and light of grace and truth that he held out to them. I
end all with that of our Savior concerning John-Baptist, he was a burning and
shining light, and God grant the after words be not verified of both Englands
and both Bostons. I speak my fears, but would be glad to entertain better
hopes. My prayers shall be that it may never be said as of old, Fuimus Troes,
fuit Ilyum, sed jam seges est ubi Troja fuit. Fuimus fideles, fuimus (...) fuit
Anglia, fuit Nov-Anglia, fuit Bostonia Europaea, Americana; Deus Pater
miserationum avertat omen per viscera Jesu Christi. Amen.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Cotton to the Bishop of Lincoln. This Letter is not
in order of time but may be considered as an appendage to the foregoing account
of Mr. Cotton's life.

To the right reverend and my very honorable good Lord, John Lord Bishop of
Lincoln, at his palace in Kurkden, present these. My very good Lord,
IT is now above twenty years ago, since by the goodness of God and (for a
good part of this time) by your Lordships lawful favor, I have enjoyed the
happiness to minister to the church of God at Boston, a remote corner of your
Lordships diocese. What I have done there, all this while, and how I have
spent my time and course, I must ere long give account to the great shepherd of
the sheep, the bishop of our souls. Mean while, give me leave to make your
Lordship this short account: The bent of my course has been (according to my
weak measure) to make and keep a 3 fold christian concord amongst the people;
between God and their conscience; between true hearted loyalty and christian
liberty; between the fear of God and the love of one another. That wherein I
have most seemed to your Lordship to fail (to wit in not discerning christian
liberty to practice some commands of authority, in some circumstances) I do
humbly thank your Lordship, and freely acknowledge, your Lordship has not
been wanting freely and often to admonish me thereof, and that with such wisdom
and gravity, and with such well tempered authority and mildness, that I profess
unfeynedly noe outward respect in the world could have deteyned me from
requesting your Lordships favor with ready subjection to your Lordships
counsel, that I might have prolonged mine own peace and your Lordships favor
together, but so it is (my good Lord) though I do unfeynedly and deservedly
honor your Lordship, and highly esteem many hundreths of other reverend
divines, great lights of the church (in comparison of whom what am I poor
spark?) who doubt not of their liberty in those matters; yet to this day (I
speak in the simplicity of my heart) I can only follow your Lordship with
observance, and them with reverence, but not with that plerophory of faith in
these things which in such cases the apostle requires, Romans 14.5. Your
Lordship well knows it is both the apostles and prophets principle (and it
holds in every righteous man from the meanest to the greatest) Justus ex fide
sua vivit, non aliena, and therefore, howsoever I do highly prize and much
prefer other men's judgment and learning, and wisdom, and piety, yet in
things pertaining to God and his worship, still, I must (as I ought) live by
mine own faith, not theirs. Nevertheless, where I cannot yield obedience of
faith, I am willing to yield patience of hope.

And now, my good lord, I see the Lord who began a year or two ago to suspend
(after a sort) my ministry from that place by a long and soar sickness (the
dregs whereof still hang about me) does now putt a further necessity upon me,
wholly to lay down my ministry there, and freely to resign my place into your
Lordships hands. For I see neither my bodily health, nor the peace of the
church will now stand with my continuance there. I do now therefore humbly
crave this last favor at your Lordships hand, to accept my place as void, and
to admit thereto such a successor as your Lordship shall find fit, and the
patron (which is the corporation of Boston) shall present to you therefore. The
congregation is great, and the church duetyes many, and those, many times,
requiring close attendance, and I would be very loath the service of God, or the
help of the people should be in any sort neglected by my long discontinuance.

What though this resignation of my place into your Lordships hands may be
defective in some form of law; yet I trust your Lordship will never forgett
the ancient moderation and aequity of that honorable and high court of
chauncery, whereunto your Lordship was advanced, to temper the rigor of legal
justice, to the relief of many distressed. Never (I think) came there any
cause before your Lordship more distressed, nor more justly craving christian
aequity.

Now the Lord of heaven and earth so guide and keep and bless your Lordship
on earth, that he may delight to crown your Lordship with honor in heaven, at
the end of your days, through Jesus Christ. Thus at once commending my hmmble
suit and late vicarage, and the comfort of the whole congregation to your
Lordships honorable favor and integrity, I humbly take leave and rest

A bounden suppliant to your Lordship and for you, J. C.
May 7. 1633.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. Arnold to the Court held at Massachusetts.
Pautuxit this 5th of September 1653.
THESE are to signify unto the much honored court that we understand how Gorton
and his confederates are intended to send great matters to General Cromwell
or to other state of England against the state of Massachusit about a letter
that came into these parts from Massachusit having four or five of the
magistrates hands unto it, concerning the French shipe that was taken by the
deceit of Capt. Hull, in which letter as we hear are seven reasons nominated
to show that it was not a lawful prize, and in one of the reasons is mentioned
the dissolving of the parliament, out of which reason, especially, Gorton takes
great hold to lay a strong accusation against the state of Massachusits. And
we further hear that they do intend to write what construction they do
gather from it and withal they mind to send it with the said letters, having
the magistrates own hands to it the which they think will be a sure testimony
against the magistrates, etc. Now as soon as I heard of it I thought it to be
my duty with all expedition to write intelligence to the much honored court, I
not knowing what mischief they may do in such a case as they do so much
boast of, that the court might have notice of their evil purpose before hand
that, if it may so please the Almighty, by his good providence and your wise
consideration and vigilant care, the evil plot of your adversaries may be
prevented, etc.

I rest your humble servant to be commanded, William Arnold.
I humbly desire that I may hear whether this letter do come safe to the
court, if not I may in short time write again, etc.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Thomas Wells to Maj. Robert Sedgewick and Capt.
John Leverett. This and the next Letter are answers to requisitions made by
Oliver for aid in recovering what is now called New York from the Dutch.

Honored Sirs,
I Have received yours of the 5th of this instant, and have given a call for a
general court, but our towns being far distant we cannott meet until the
beginning of the week. I have sent a messenger to Major John Mason who lives
at Seabrooke, but he is not yet returned. I know that our colony will with all
thankfullness embrace this favor and respect from his highness and with all
readiness attend the counsel and advice of his commissioners, we shall send
one commissioner to join in counsel with yours, and I suppose by this time
you understand what concurrence there is from the Bay, that you might inform
us what number of men you expect from us, and what kind of provisions you most
need, we have at present plenty of biskett, and some porke, but little butter
or cheese; also which way you intend your shipping shall come, and where our
men shall meet, we are altogether ignorant in the managing of affairs of
this nature, and therefore desire you would dispatch our messenger with what
speed you can, to give us some information and direction herein, and you shall
find our readiness to assist according to that little strength and means we are
furnished withal. Also we desire to know what number of land soldiers you
can spare for the design: It is thought by some that know the strength of the
Dutch, that this service will require at least 500 land soldiers. Capt.
Underhill and John Young, who are gone toward the Bay, can best inform you
of the state of things there, either in regard of fortification or the number
of men, various reports come thence. I am glad to hear of your safe arrival
after so long and tedious a voyage, and hope you are preserved to be
instruments for the good of church and common wealth, thus with remembrance of
my due respect to yourselves, I take my leave and rest ready to attend the
service as I shall receive further direction and advice from you and remain,

Your loving friend, Thomas Wells. Thomas Wells was a Magistrate of
Connecticut Colony, afterward Governor, before Connecticut and New Haven were
united, and Deputy Governor after the Union.

Robert Sedgwigg, etc. at Boston,
Gentlemen,
YOURS bearing date the 13th of these presents we received by our messengers
Capt. Standish and Capt. Willett, and having seriously agitated and deliberated
upon particulars in reference to the command sent unto us by his highness the
Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland, as also unto your proposals;
the result is that by the help of God we intend to close with you in your
intended enterprise against the Dutch at the Manhatoes with such small help as
we are able to aford; and according to your desire we have appointed Capt.
Thomas Willett to repair to you with all convenient speed to aford what help
may be for the facillitating the aforesaid expedition, and it shall be our
endeavor to have such means conducing to the aforesaid expedition as we are
able to aford in as good readiness as we can with all convenient speed, we
rest,

Sir, Your assured friends, Nathaniell Morton, Clarke by order of the general
court.

Boston in New England 20th October 1654. May it please this honored court,
PRovidence having so disposed it as to bring the province of Accadia under
the power and government of his highness Oliver lord protecter of England,
Scotland and Ireland, we well knowing what great respect you owe unto the
state of England, and not doubting of your readiness in any thing you can to
manifest the same to them, are therefore encouraged to make these few
propositions in the name of his highness and the state of England.

1. That you would be pleased to declare that if the English inhabitting in the
country of Accadia be at any time assaulted with an enemy, or in any occasion
of needing help from this government, you will assist us with such men as we
may stand in need of, we paying for them according to the custom of paying
soldiers in this country in any service you employ them in.

2. That as its well known that at present there is noe ways to maintain the
vast expense of the garrison but by trade with the salvages, as its now a
settled law in that province that not any should trade with them but such as
are deputed by those in authority in the province, that accordingly you would
assent and consent that law and order, so far as that it may be effectual in
this government, so as when any shall be convicted of the breach thereof they
may suffer as if they had been taken in the province of Accadia.

Many reasons we might give, and shall if desired, why there might be a
compliance with us in this our request, but we hope that respect and compliance
with England will be argument enough to admit this favor in which we hope we
attend much the good of these plantations, and be confident you shall find us
ready to our power to serve you either here or in any place God shall cast us
in, and remain your humble servants,

Robert Sedgwicke, John Leverett, Wm. Hathorne, Robert Fenn, Mark Harrison,

Copy of a Letter from the Corporation in England for propagating the Gospel,
etc. to the Commissioners of the united Colonies.
The Commissioners of the Massachusetts presented this ensueing letter from the
Corporation in England.
Gentlemen,
YOUR letter we received and return you this answer, that we are very glad
and approve of the accounts you sent over by the last, which are or may be
sattisfactory to the manifold objections have of late arisen about the same,
for when (through mercy) our demeanors had stopped the mouths of all men here,
then the great quere was, whether things sent were not misapplied with you in
New England. And truly you would wonder had we but time to relate the several
sorts of objections, which for the most part turn all to obstructions for a
season; till by the elaborate pains of Mr. Winslow, we are forced to take off
and remove the same, you wrote to us not to send any more goods till you sent
for them, and to tie ourselves to such and only such provisions to be sent. We
are very well sattisfied therewith, and thereupon shall deceive the expectation
of diverse, that have written for letters, for printing paper, etc. and indeed
in so writing you seem to understand your own power and trust, but give us
leave to tell you there is such a material objection here started as we are
ashamed of and know not how to answer, viz. the manifold complaints made by Mr.
Elliot to sundry his friends here, that you allow him but L. 20 per ann. which
does not bear his charges, insomuch as he runs in debt every year more and
more, and is disabled for giving his children that education he otherwise
would. Now whether it be or no we know not, but verily believe the work will
suffer some thousands of pounds by it, for it flies like lightning and takes
like tinder, men being extreme glad to meet with any thing may color over
their covetousnes, and dull their zeal in so good a work: Nay Mr. Peter's
who, but fourteen days before, told Mr. Winslow in plain terms he heard the
work was but a plain cheat, and that there was no such thing as gospel
conversion amongst the Indians, presently after, charged the same man upon a
letter he received from Mr. Weld, by information from Mr. Elliot that you the
commissioners for the united colonies forbad the work in that you would not
allow competent maintenance to Mr. Elliot, and others that labored therein;
and however we have otherwise charitable thoughts of Peter's yett he has been
a very bad instrument all along toward this work, who (though of a committee
in the army for the advance of it amongst them) yett protested against
contributing a penny toward it in person, and indeed some of us have been
feign to entreat the rest of the gentlemen not to trouble him any further in
the business, nor know we any cause unless it be that the work is coming to
such perfection and he has not had the least hand or finger in it. These
things we thought good to acquaint you withal; and do entreat that Mr.
Elliott, Mr. Mayhew and such other eminent laborers as are employed therein
may have greater encouragement from you than so; yea such according to what the
Lord shall send in from time to time. We are far from justifying Mr. Elliott
in his turbulent and clamorous proceedings, but the best of Gods servants have
their faylings, and as such so we look upon him. The reason you send for
nothing this year we conceive is, because you have about 800 l. in money
stock and debts with you, we should be glad to hear that debts are received,
and do entreat you that the work may not be retarded thereby; alas, what
pity were it that deserving instruments should be discouraged, and what a shame
will it be to us here, besides an absolute period to all future collections,
whereby Gods glory and the present opportunity will be lost in doing good to
those poor souls; and let not the late difference between your neighbors
of the Massachusetts and yourselves hinder, This was a dispute between the
Massachusetts and the other Colonies concerning the extent of the Power of the
Commissioners.
we hope it is healed ere now, if not we trust our letters (for we are
sensible of the breach and the evils may follow thereupon to the several
respective governments) will help forward the same; and let us entreat you,
since you order us to send nothing but what you give order for, to be very
careful to consider before hand what will be needful, for we persuade
ourselves you cannot buy any goods so well bought here as what we send, for
we buy for ready money and bear the adventure, when as others take not only
twelve months time but their creditors stand to the adventure out and home, so
that if you sell at thirty per cent. yett you give sixty for what you buy at
least; but we doubt not of your care, only we shall long to hear again from
you and that it may be with comfort and refreshing is the earnest desire of

Gentlemen, Your faithful friends and fellow laborers in this work of the
Lord, Signed by the order and appointment of the Corporation, by Wm. Steel,
President.

To which Letter the Commissioners returned this following Answer.
Honnorable Sir,
YOURS of the 18th of February last we have received, with the contents
whereof we are diversely affected; glad that the accounts we sent do in any
measure answer objections and remove obstructions; he who observes all our
carriage and aims in this work of his, knows (that laying aside all sinister
respects we desire to improve all opportunities and order all disbursements
for the advancement of the end designed, that if it please the father of
mercies, the gospel of his sone may have a large and powerful entrance into
the hearts of these poor Indians, but it is an afflicting consideration that
the work should receive any discouragement or hinderance either from Mr.
Elliotts penn or Mr. Peter's speech. By a letter signed by Mr. Winslow in the
name and by order of the honored Corporation, dated May the 1st 1652, we
understood what inconvenience did or might grow by the collections and
disbursments made by Mr. Butcher not put into the corporation stock and
account, which (with you) we desired might be brought into your treasury, as
the right channel, accordingly we enquired of Mr. Elliott what somes are sent
over yearly upon those more private accounts and how employed, what part to
the Indians, and what to himself and others who labor in the work; he
acknowledged some considerable somes of money came that way to his hands, but
was slow to give any account how much or how expended; hereupon we did
conceive that 20 l. per ann. added to what he received by other means out of
England and what he received from the church of Roxbury (which as we hear is
not less than 60 l. per ann.) might sufficiently mayntaine his family and
afford due education to his children without running himself into debt. We
shall now allow him forty pounds per ann. and, if there be cause, shall readily
enlarge further, and so to Mr. Mayhew; all we propound is, that as our masters
acceptance is sufficient, nay rich wages, for any care or pains of ours in
this work, so there may be some due proportion (as near as we can judge)
betwixt the employment and encouragement of other instruments. Through the
blessing of him who is love itself and the God of peace, the Commmissioners now
met at Hartford do comfortably close, as in the affairs of the corporation,
so in the other occasions of the confaederation, and hope they shall so
proceed.

Mr. Elliot and Mr. Mayhew do each of them propound the building a new meeting
house for the Indians, besides the building in hand for some scholars at the
college (whereof we wrote the last year) and that allowance may be made for
interpreters, schoolmasters and others, to instruct the teacheable Indians; one
catechism is already printed, and Mr. Pierson is preparing another to suite
these southwest parts, where the language differs, from theires who live about
the Massachusetts; all which will occasion us to write for a considerable
parcel of provisions, as the following invoice will show; we expect not so
good pennyworths from any as from the Corporation, and though the ammunition
were, in different proportions, this last year divided amongst the Colonies
and by them (with the advance formerly mentioned) since returned into the
stock, yet we purpose to drive very little or no trade but upon the account
and concernment of the Indians.

Mr. Rawson has sent his accounts for the year past to the Commissioners now
met at Hartford, but upon perusal we find something defective or obscure, so
that we returned them to him to be perfected, and must desire the
Commissioners for the Massachusetts to review and upon their approbation to
underwrite and send them for England. We here enclose the coppie of a
direction sent us from the Massachusetts for letters for the use of printing,
which we desire may be provided and sent. Thus, with our due respects, we
commend yourselves and the work in hand to the blessing of the only wise and
gracious God, resting

Your humble servants, Theophilus Eaton, Presidt. Simon Bradstreet, Daniell
Dennison, Tho. Prence, Jno Brown. Jno Webster, Jno Mason, Francis Newman,

Hartford 18. Sept. 54.
Instructions for Major Simon Willard, commander in chief of our forces, and
such as are joined with him as a counsel of war. The Commissioners were of
opinion that it was necessary to enter into a War with the Naraghanset Indians.
The Massachusetts Colony was averse to it. Willard was a Massachusetts man and
seems to have defeated the intent of the Commissioners.

YOU are to take under your charge and command all such forces, horse and foot
as, according to the order of the Commissioners, are or shall be levied, out of
three of the Collonyes, with which you are to be at the appointed randevouz at
Tho. Stantons, at or before the 13th of October next, and forthwith to march
into the Nianticke country to the place of Ninnigrets ordinary residence, and
to demand of him (if he may be spoken with) a present and full surrender of all
the Pequotts under him, or lately living upon his land, and if he does not
forthwith consent, then to take them by force from him or any that shall harbor
or detain them and to remove and settle them under the protection of the
English and under such government as Mr. Winthrop, Major Mason and Capt.
Dennison shall appoint, till the Commissioners shall take further order,
without increasing the tribute formerly due from them.

And further, to require and take of Ninnigret the tribute due for time past,
for the said Pequotts, together with the charge of this expedition, or some
considerable part of both, and to give him time for the rest, according to
your discretion, as may stand with the honor of the English and the safety of
the country.

And you are in the name of the Commissioners to prohibit him and the rest of
the Narragansett Sachems to make any further attempts upon the Long Island
Indians, and to assure them that the Commissioners will lay the like charge
upon the Long Island Indians not to invade or disturb them, which if he refuse,
and that the peace of the country can by no other means be provided for, you
are to proceed as the case requires. But if Ninnigret shall not oppose the
removal of the Pequotts but shall demean himself fairly in that busenes and
shall submitt to our charge, and promise that he will not further disturb the
peace of the country, we judge it not expedient at this season of the year
to begin the war upon him barely for the non payment of the tribute and
charges, supposing also, that you may use other means to draw some part of it
from him at present and the residue may be forborne for some convenient time,
provided if the Pequotts cannot be prevayled with to come under the government
and protection of the English, then if Ninnigret shall pay the tribute past and
the charges of this expedition, and promise not to disturb the peace of the
country for time to come by making war upon our friends and confederates
without our consent, according to his covenant made at Boston anno 1645, as
also to pay the tribute for such Indians as are under him for time to come,
according to the last agreement at New Haven 1651, he may enjoy the said
Pequotts still without disturbance or any further proceeding against him.

But if you shall find the design cannot be carried on without a great force,
then you shall with all expedition send to the several colonies for the rest
of the forces in this case ordered by the Commissioners, which you are to
improve according to your best skill for the speedy reducing of Ninnigret to
subjection or tribute, with security by hostages, for his performance of the
same.

And if yett a greater force shall be found necessary, you are to give notice
to the several colonies of the whole number you desire, that they may send
their several proportions according to the agreement of the Commissioners.

You shall, if you think fit, send to Uncas (whom we have prepared) to
assist you and may be very useful in the service. You are to make fair war,
without exercising cruelty and not to put to death any whom you have taken
captive, if you can bestow them without dainger of your own men.

If you find any English straglers, traders or others, whom you shall suspect
to give intelligence, or to furnish with arms or ammunition, or to give any
other aid to the enemy, you may secure them or send them to Boston.

Lastly, and above all the rest, we commend to your christian care the
upholding of the worship of God in your army and to keep such watch over the
conversation of all those under your charge that all prophanes and impiety,
abuse of the sacred name of God, luxury and other disorders may be avoided, or
duly punished, that the Lord may be pleased to go forth before you, prosper
all your proceedings and return to us in peace, which we shall daily pray
for, etc.

Copy of a Letter from Major Simon Willard to the Commissioners of the united
Colonies.
Honored Gentlemen,
YOurselves having been pleased to appoint and give a commission for a general
to command over all the forces, by you appointed to be raised out of the united
colonies in the expedition against Ninnigret, which you referred to the
council of the Massachusetts to complete, they having, after the refusal of
Major Gibbons and Major Denuison, Capt. Atherton being absent, pitched on
myself (though unworthy accepted thereof in hope of God's gracious assistance
therein) These are therefore to inform you, that I addressed myself
accordingly, and with the unanimous consent of my council, have with the best
of our understanding of your instructions (which were not so clear as we could
have wished) repaired to the place of randevouz, endeavored to have had full
discourse with Ninnigret, who, before we came, had swampt A common expression
to signify the retreat or resort of the Indians into boggy Places full of Woods
where the English must be under great disadvantage in an attack upon them.
himself and refused conference with us, as appears in the narrative which I
send you, therefore, considering the season, tediousnes of the march of the
foot, and streightnes of our instructions, contented ourselves with reduceing
of those Pequotts, as we have certified you. On those terms we endeavored
your full satisfaction, and wherein we have fallen short, we hope you will
putt a candid interpretation. I shall say no more at present but commend you to
the protection, direction and blessing of the Almighty and remain,

Sirs, your humble servant, Simon Willard.
Dated 26th of 8th mo. 1654, Boston.
The Narrative follows.
MY self, whose name is underwritten, being empowered by the Commissioners of
the united Colonies, bearing date the 25th Sept. 1654, do declare the
particular acts of the proceeding of the council of war being assembled at
Thomas Stantons, according to the instructions received from the said
Commissioners, as follows.

Imprimis, our first instruction being forthwith to march into the Nyanticke
country, the place of Ninnigrets ordinary place of residence, and to demand of
him (if he may be spoke with) the Pequotts, etc. The reasons why we did not
attend to that particular was, we knew he was removed from that place up into
the woods into a swamp, some 15 miles from our quarters, and further, by a
storm the boats of Conecticott and Newhaven, whereas all were to meet 13
October 54, we say, the boats and some of the soldiers with their stock of
ammunition came not to us until the 16th day the one, and the 17th day the
other. Further, we had one clause in our instructions to act as might stand
with the honor of the English and the safety of the country, but for us to
move with our forces we thought it would make great rumor to stir amongst
the Indians, when they should hear we were returned to our quarters and did
nothing; therefore we thought it would expedite our work to attend that that
was presented to us, which are as follows.

First, Ninnegret having some of his Indians present with us, who as we
supposed were willing to salve up things as well as they could, we agreed to
send some of them to him to advise him to come and speak with us, but we
having intelligence of his great fear to consent to this motion, we offered
him hostages for the security of his person, and if this pleased him not, he
should acquaint us what he would desire to secure him; his answer was, by 4 of
his men, that one of our Indians had taken away a canoe of his and made prize
of it, and upon this he was more afraid than before.

2dly, He demanded what he had done to the English that they came so against
him round about, and will not let him alone, and he would desire to transact
this business by messengers, and not come face to face.

3dly, He said his father was a friend to the English in former times, and he
wondered they should be so against him now. Our answer to these things were as
follows. First, we knew nothing of the canoe, and that if any of our Indians
had wronged him in this kind they should restore it again; but they would not
forbear this discourse, so we sent them away with these following answers,
First, we wondered that he, a wise man as he would be accounted, that he
should offer to hold us in discourse about such a trifle as a canoe is, either
he must be unwise himself, or think us unwise, if we should be delayed with
such things at these. 2dly, That it was not the fashion of the English to
transact things of such a nature by messengers from an ambassador, but to come
face to face. 3dly, If this course might have been taken, we could have done
this from the place of our habitation, without raising these forces. The 16th,
there came some of the Pequotts and told us that, the day before this, they
went toward Ninnegretts company to persuade their kindred to come from him,
fearing otherwise it would go ill with them, but they met with three Pequotts
that did adhere to Ninegrett, who asked them what they did there, they said
they had something to do; then they asked our Pequotts how many there were of
them, they said 30, then said the 3 men there are 30 heads for us; then our
Pequotts said they did attend the English to carrey letters or burdens abroad,
where the English should have occasion to send them, then one of the 3 men told
them they would have their 30 heads before to morrow in the afternoon, though
the English men were with them, and they said they would not desert from the
war against the Long Islanders, neither would they forsake Ninegrett. This day
they came into us and gave in their names to the number of 73. The 17th day
there came into us more Pequotts that lived near to Ninegrett, which, before,
we commanded to bring away their houses and goods, which things they did, and
gave in their names as the rest to the number of 36. The 18th day, Ninegrett
still keeping off and would no ways comply with us, we agreed and sent two
gentlemen with two to attend them, and two interpreters to make some demands of
him; but there being six he refused to speak with above two of them, but
after much debate with his scours and some of his chief men, they came to
speak with them, viz. Capt. Davis and Capt. Seely, and first they demanded the
Pequotts under him, his answer was, why do ye demand the Pequotts of me when
you have them already? they demanded more, his answer was he had not above 3 or
4 with him, but the rest were disposed abroad a hunting and elsewhere, but in
the issue he engaged by writing to surrender all that were under him into the
hands of Mr. Winthrop or Capt. Mason within seven days. 2dly, They demanded the
tribute due for the Pequotts, his answer was he never engaged for them; he was
told he paid it at New Haven; he said the reason of that was he feared they
would have been taken from him, therefore he paid 9 or 10 fathom of his own
peage to make up the some. 3dly, They further required not to make any more war
against the Long Island Indians, to this he was silent for a time, but after
said this; Shall such a prince and two such captains loose their lives and
their blood not be revenged? the answer to this was, he must act in a right way
by making the commissioners acquainted with it, but he was silent. Further he
was charged not to molest them nor any other of the friends of the English lest
his head were set up upon an English pole. Also he was informed that none of
ours should molest him. 4thly, The charges of this expedition was demanded of
him, his answer was he was not the cause of it, but the Long Island Indians
killed him a man at Connecticott.

A Copy of the Covenant with Ninegret.
WHEREAS the Commissioners of the united Colonies demand by their messengers
that I deliver up to the English all the captive Pequotts in my country, I
hereby engage myself to surrender the said Pequotts within 7 days to Mr.
Winthrop or Capt. Mason. Witness my hand. And so he set his mark the 18th of
8ber 54.

Witness Thomas Stanton Interpreter. Valentine Whitman Interpreter.


Witness also Thomas Blighe.

The 19th day a copy of the covenant or promise of Paukannusamon, being a
Narreganset Sachem who had diverse of the Pequotts under him, who had subscribed
their names unto us, who promises to live peaceably and not disturb any of the
friends of the English, and desires not to be disturbed by any of them, and so
set his mark.

A copy of the Pequotts covenant whereto they subscribed the 16th and 17th of
the 8th month 1654.
WE whose names are underwritten, being captive Pequotts and tributaries to the
English, and having lived some time under the protection of Ninegrett, do
freely consent to the Commissioners of the united English colonies to remove to
such places as the said Commissioners do or shall appoint us, and do hereby
disowne the jurisdiction of Ninegrett over us, and that we intend really so to
do, we here give in our names severally with our own marks affixed. Further
we do hereby engage ourselves hereafter not to join in any war with
Ninegrett or any other, without the full and free consent of the Commissioners
of the united English Colonies.

This is a true account of our actions in each particular by the council of
war. Simon Willard.
This 20th of the 8th month 1654. We set upon our march from Boston the 9th
of the 8th month 1654. We returned again to Boston the 24th of the same
monthe.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Winslow to Secretary Thurloe.
Right Honorable,
ABOUT twelve days since I wrote to you by Capt. Collens, wherein I gave you a
large account of our proceedings in this island of the Barbados; how that by
Gods blessing we attained our passage in five weeks, made the 2500 men we
landed 6000, and because our stores for the army were not as yet come up close
we should lose the dry season and my lords honor suffer thereby and have
scrabled up so many arms as to make the 1500, we here brought, 6000 or near
thereabout: that we raised two small troops of horse upon the island and
gotten such and so many other stores as we are to set sail this evening from
the place: We thought to have gone the 24th instant but could not attain
thereunto. Since which time came Capt. Hassefield of London and tells us of the
Great Charity, that she was at sea with him; but says that she with many
others in company were forced back by the foul weather. This gentleman was
above two months, from Falmouth hither, and tells us our storeships were in the
Downs with a safe convoy and believes they will be here speedily; but truly,
Sir, we are so weary of waiting and the season so near spent as we are resolved
to cast ourselves into the arms of Almighty God, whose providence we trust will
be ever for good and will own us as instruments in his right hand to execute
his determined vengeance upon that tyrannous and idolatrous and bloody nation
that has inflicted so many cruelties upon the nations of the earth in their
distressed members and not the least upon ours. We have agreed to order the
Great Charity to stay here till our stores come up and then to convey them to
us. The general has settled the militia of the island and given commission to
four regiments of horse and four of foot and made the governor his
lieutenant-generall and Col. Collison major-generall of this island. I hope it
will conduce to the public weal of the place. We have made bold to refer our
commissioners to make use of their excise office whereof the governor had a 3d,
which 3d we still leave him to possess; but whereas they call upon their
articles I tell them they have broken that article, for whereas they were to
pay the public debts of the island therewith they have received all those two
years profitts past and we none at all, and now we shall reap the cropp of
this 3d year, but with a great deal of indignation to many. We ask them how
long his highness shall wait their pleasure to receive his royalties? We have
such a body of business to go through this day that I fear I shall not be
able to write over my letter anew. If it so fall out I had rather send you a
blotted paper than a note, and write amongst a crowd of people as I do here
than not to write at all: and I trust your honor will bury it amongst the rest
of my infirmities which is the earnest desire of

Right honorable your most humble servant Edw. Winslow.
Barbados, March 30. 1655. I humbly entreat your honor to get a dispatch to
Capt. Paris and Capt. Turners business.



Copy of a Letter from the Commissioners of the united Colonies to Major
Willard.
Loveing friend Major Willard,
WE have received and considered both the letter you writ and the trust
committed to you, and the account thereof, the last year, in which (to speak
heartily according to your desire) we find mistakes and errors, we hear you
had not the unanimous consent of your council, and certainly your instructions
(which stand upon record in each of the united colonies) are clear enough to
have guided you to a further progress than you made in the service, nor do
we find any considerable difficulty in the way. Ninigrett, through the fear
that then possessed him, might (in all probability) have been enforced to
receive any impression the chief commander of such forces would have putt upon
him, but the not improving of a season (especially in such a service) is often
attended with mischievous consequences. Ninegrett, who whilst our small army
was there, had his mouth as in the dust, soon after grew high and insolent in
his speech and carriage, refuses to deliver the rest of his Pequotts,
threatens them that have left him, has again invaded the Long Island Indians,
our friends, tributaries and in covenant with us; some blood is already shed,
how much more may be shortly shed is not yet known, and how far our charge
and danger may be increased by his pride and treachery engaging foreign
Indians against us, and what further inconveniences may arrise from your
nonattendance to your commission is yet uncertain, and as doubtful how they
may be prevented; but what satisfaction may be from yourselfe, and those of
your council that joined with you, expected, we leave to the consideration of
the colonies and rest

Your loveing friends, James Cudworth John Mason John Cullick Wm. Leete.

The General Court of the Massachusetts in New England assembled at Boston the
23d of November 1655.
To our trusty and much honored friend Captain John Leverett.
Jo. Endecott, Gov.
WHEREAS this court has chosen and appointed you to be their agent in England
during your aboade there: You are hereby commissioned and empowered according
to instructions heerewith given unto you to appear for us and act in our
behalf in all matters of concernment to us, before his Highness the Lord
Protector of the Common Wealths of England Scotland and Ireland and his
honorable Council there. Given at Boston the day and year above written. In
testimony whereof the seal of this colonie is heereunto affixed.

By the Court, Edward Rawson, Secretary.

The General Court's Instructions.
Instructions for our trusty and much honored friend Capt. John Leveret,
chosen and empowered by this Court as our Agent to present our desires to his
Highness, or Counsel of State in England, and to negotiate our affairs there as
opportunity may afford or emergencie of occasions require, according to the
ensuing Instructions.

1. YOU are desired to take the first convenient opportunity to present the
letter from this Court (heerewith delivered) unto his Highness. And upon all
occasions to let his Highness understand how thankfully we accept and at all
times readily acknowledge his Highness favor and clemency toward us, and to
assure him of our real and sincere affection toward his Highness and readiness
upon all occasions to be serviceable unto him to the utmost of our power and
ability.

2. You are also requested to inform his Highness of a letter sent the last
year to Mr. Winslow to be presented unto his Highness, and that it is our
humble desire to know if his Highness received it (a copy whereof we have
heerewith delivered you) and diligently to observe what sense his Highness shall
be pleased (of himself) to express concerning the same.

3. That you also humbly desire on our behalf that seeing our former agent is
dead, and we have many enemies in the world, that all complaints made against
us by one or other may take no place in his princely breast, but be suspended
from all belief till we may have knowledge thereof and opportunity to answer
for ourselves.

4. If peace be concluded betwixt England and France, and the French fortes in
these parts included therein, and that you find a propensitie in his Highness
to gratify New England with the same, that you improve your best interest and
opportunity for the obtaining thereof, provided they be free from charges and
other engagements.

5. You are further hereby desired humbly to move his Highness that this
country may have the opportunity to furnish his fleet at Jamaica with
provisions of wheat, beef, pork, etc. to the value of ten or twelve thousand
pounds per annum, for bills of exchange into England, according to his Highness
order, and to promote the settling of a magazine here for supplying the West
India fleet as occasion may require. And in this affair, if you see cause or
need, you may improve the help of Mr. Peter's, Mr. Hopkins, or any other
friend of ours, and may engage for the prices to our best advantage, or as they
gave the last year.

6. If any complaint be made by Mr. Rigby concerning our claim by virtue of
our patent, as intrenching upon what he calls the province of Ligoma, you may
for the present make the best answer you may, for the reasons expressed in our
answer given Mr. Cleaves agent, a copy whereof we herewith deliver you, which
if it satisfy not, you may crave liberty for our further answer.

By the court, Edward Rawson, Secretary.
Boston 23d of November 1655.
Copy of an Address to his Highness Oliver Cromwell.
May it please your Highness,
AMIDST the thronge of important suitors and oppressing multitude of occasions
of high concernment, to accept of our most humble thankful acknowledgment of
your continued favors to us poor exiles in these utmost ends of the earth. We
might account it no little disadvantage whilst others having nearer access to
your highness, and thereby opportunity to restifie their zeal for your
service, that we by our distance should be disenabled from giving any other
demonstration than an anniversary acknowledgment of our obligation, were it not
that your own goodness under God were the fountain whence all these streams
of bounty have been derived unto us, whereby we are encouraged to hope as we
have good cause to beseech for the continuance thereof: The want whereof would
be most prejudicial if not destructive to this colonie, when the endeavors of
some may be to misinforme your highness, by presenting complaints against us, we
having none to intercede for us or truly to represent unto your highness in our
behalf: The consideration whereof, were not God our gracious father in the
Lord Jesus, would overwhelme us did not the assurance of your highness clemency
patience and singular affection support us; But that we might not seem to be
wanting in the defense of our own innocence, nor presume too far upon your
highness indulgence, we have desired our loving and honored friend Capt. John
Leveret to give your highness a true account of all our actings wherein your
highness shall see cause to require satisfaction, not doubting but the clearing
of our innocence will be most acceptable to your highness, being confident no
impression to the contrary will be received, before we have had the
opportunity to vindicate the same from any aspersions that may occasionallie
be cast upon us. We dare not presume further to detayne your highness from the
care of your more weighty affairs, the prosperous success whereof is the
daily prayer of

Your highness most humbly devoted servants, J. Endecot, Gov. R. Bellingham, D.
Gov.


Copy of a Letter from Mr. Roger Williams President of Providence Plantations,
to the General Court of Magistrates and Deputies assembled at Boston.
Providence, 15. 9mo. 55. (so called) Much honored Sir,
IT is my humble and earnest petition unto God and you, that you may so be
pleased to exercise command over your own spirits that you may not mind myself
nor the English of these parts (unworthy with myself of your eye) but only that
face of equity (English and christian) which I humbly hope may appear in
these representations following.

First, May it please you to remember, that concerning the town of Warwick (in
this colonie) there lies a suite of L. 2000 damages against you before his
highness and the lords of his council, I doubt not if you so please but that
(as Mr. Winslow and myself had well nigh ordered it) some gentlemen from
yourselves and some from Warwick deputed, may friendly and easily determine
that affair between you.

Secondly, The Indians which pretend your name at Warwick and Pawtuxet (and yet
live as barbarously if not more than any in the country) please you to know
their insolences upon ourselves and cattle (unto L. 20 damages per annum) are
insufferable by English spirits; and please you to give credence that to all
these they pretend your name and affirm that they dare not (for offending you)
agree with us, nor come to rules of righteous neighborhood, only they know you
favor us not and therefore send us for redress unto you.

Thirdly, Concerning four English families at Pawtuxet, may it please you to
remember that two controversies they have long (under your name) maintained
with us, to a constant obstructing of all order and authority amongst us.

To our complaint about our lands they lately have professed a willingness to
arbitrate, but to obey his highness authority in this charter, they say, they
dare not for your sakes, though they live not by your laws, nor bear your
common charges nor ours, but evade both under color of your authority.

Honored Sirs, I cordially prosesse it before the most high, that I believe
it, if not only they but ourselves and all the whole country, by joint consent,
were subject to your government, it might be a rich mercy; but as things yet
are, and since it pleased first the parliament, and then the lord admiral and
committee for foraigne plantations, and since the council of state, and lastly
the lord protector and his council, to continue us as a distinct colonie, yea
and since it has pleased yourselves by public letters and references to us
from your public courts to own the authority of his Highness amongst us; be
pleased to consider how unsuitable it is for yourselves (if these families at
Pawtuxet plead truth) to be the obstructers of all orderly proceedings amongst
us; for I humbly appeal to your own wisdoms and experience how unlikely it
is for a people to be compelled to order and common charges, when others in
their bosoms are by such (seeming) partiality exempted from both.

And therefore (lastly) be pleased to know, that there are (upon the point) but
two families which are so obstructive and destructive to an equal proceeding
of civil order amongst us; for one of these 4 families, Stephen Arnold,
desires to be uniforme with us; a second Zachary Rhodes, being in the way of
dipping is (potentially) banished by you. Only Wm. Arnold and Wm. Carpenter
(very far also in religion from you, if you knew all) they have some color,
yet in a late conference they all plead that all the obstacle is their
offending of yourselves.

Fourthly, whereas (I humbly conceave) with the people of this colonie your
commerce is as great as with any in the country, and our dangers (being a
frontier people to the Barbarians) are greater than those of other colonies,
and the ill consequences to yourselves would be not a few nor small, and to the
whole land, were we first massacred or mastered by them. I pray your aequall
and favorable reflection upon that your law which prohibits us to buy of you
all means of our necessary defense of our lives and families (yea in this most
bloody and massacring time.)

We are informed that tickets have rarely been denied to any English of the
country; yea the barbarians (though notorious in lies) if they profess
subjection, they are furnished: Only ourselves, by former and later denial,
seem to be devoted to be the Indian shambles and massacres.

The barbarians all the land over are filled with artillery and ammunition
from the Dutch, openly and horridly, and from all the English over the country
(by stealth) I know they abound so wonderfully, that their activitie and
insolency is grown so high, that they daily consult and hope and threaten to
render us slaves, as they long since (and now most horribly) have made the
Dutch.

For myself (as through Gods goodness) I have refused the gain of thousands
by such a murtherous trade, and think no law yet extant amongst yourselves or
us secure enough against such a villainie; so am I loath to see so many
hundreds (if not some thousands) in this colonie destroyed like fools and
beasts without resistance: I grieve that so much blood should cry against
yourselves, yea and I grieve that (at this instant by these ships) this cry and
the premises should now trouble his highness and his council. For the
seasonable preventing of which is this humble address presented to your
wisdom, by him who desires to be

Your unfeigned and faithful servant, Roger Williams, of Providence
plantations, president.
Hon. Sirs, Since my letter, it comes into my heart to pray your leave to add a
word as to myself, viz. At my last return from England I presented your then
honored governor, Mr. Bellingham, with an order of the lords of the council
for my free taking ship or landing at your parts, unto which it pleased Mr.
Bellingham to send me his assent in writing, I humbly crave the recording of it
by yourselves, least forgetfullnes hereafter again put me upon such distresses
as, God knows, I suffered when I last past through your colonie to our native
country.



Copy of a Letter from Providence Plantations to the General Court of the
Massachusetts.
Providence, 12.3.56. (so called)
MAY it please this much honored assembly to remember that, as an officer and
in the name of Providence Colonie. I presented you with our humble requests
before winter, unto which not receaving answer I addressed myself this spring
to your much honored Governor, who was pleased to advise our sending of some
of Providence to your assembly.

Honored Sirs, our first request (in short) was and is, for your favorable
consideration of the long and lamentable condition of the town of Warwick,
which has been thus. They are so dangerously and so vexatiously intermingled
with the Barbarians, that I have long admired the wonderful power of God in
restraining and preventing very great fires, of mutual slaughters, breaking
forth between them.

Your wisdoms know the inhumane insultations of these wild creatures, and you
may be pleased also to imagine, that they have not been sparing of your name as
the patron of all their wickedness against our English men, women and children,
and cattle to the yearly damage of 60, 80 and 100 l.

The remedy is (under God) only your pleasure that Pumham shall come to an
agreement with the town or colonie, and that some convenient way and time be
set for their removal.

And that your wisdoms may see just grounds for such your willingness, be
pleased to be informed of a realitie of a solemn covenant between this town
of Warwick and Pumham, unto which, notwithstanding that he pleads his being
drawn to it by the awe of his superior Sachims, yet I humbly offer that what
was done was according to the law and tenor of the natives (I take it) in all
New England and America, viz. that the inferior Sachims and subjects shall
plant and remove at the pleasure of the highest and supreme Sachims, and I
humbly conceave that it pleases the Most High and only Wise to make use of
such a bond of authority over them, without which they could not long subsist
in humane societies, in this wild condition wherein they are.

2. Please you not to be insensible of the slipperie and dangerous condition of
this their intermingled cohabitation. I am humbly confident, that all the
English towns and plantations in all New England put together suffer not such
molestation from the natives as this one town and people. It is so great and
so oppressive that I have daily feared the tidings of some public fire and
mischief.

3. Be pleased to review this copy from the lord admiral and that this
English town of Warwick should proceed, also that if any of yours were there
planted they should by your authority be removed. And we humbly conceave that
if the English (whose removes are difficult and chargeable) how much more these
wild ones, who remove with little more trouble and damage then the wild beasts
of the wilderness.

4. Please you to be informed that this small neck (wherein they keep and
mingle fields with the English) is a very den of wickedness, where they not only
practice the horrid barbarisms of all kind of whoredoms, idolatries and
conjurations but living without all exercise of actual authority, and getting
store of liquors (to our grief) there is a confidence and rendezvous of all
the wildest and most licentious natives and practices of the whole country.

5. Beside satisfaction to Pumham and the former inhabitants of this neck,
there is a competitour who must also be satisfied, another Sachim, one
Nawwushawsuck, who (living with Ousamaquin) lays claim to this place, and are
at daily fewd with Pumham (to my knowledge) about the title and lordship of it.
Hostility is daily threatened.

Our second request concerns 2 or 3 English families at Pawtuxet who, before
our charter, subjected themselves unto your jurisdiction. It is true, there are
many grievances between many of the town of Providence and them, and these I
humbly conceave may best he ordered to be composed by reference.

But (2) we have formerly made our addresses and now do for your prudent
removal of this great and long obstruction to all due order and regular
proceedings among us, viz. the refusal of these families (pretending your
name) to conform with us unto his Highness authority amongst us.

3. Your wisdoms experimentally know how apt men are to stumble at such an
exemption from all duties and services from all rates and charges either with
yourselves or us.

4. This obstruction is so great and constant, that (without your prudent
removal of it) it is impossible that either his Highness or yourselves can
expect such satisfaction and observance from us as we desire to render.

Lastly, as before, we promised satisfaction to the natives at Warwick (and
shall all possible ways endeavor their content) so we humbly offer as to these
our countrymen, First, as to grievances depending, that references may settle
them. 2dly, For the future, the way will be open for their enjoyment of votes
and privileges, of choosing or being chosen to any office in town or colonie.

Our third request is for your favorable leave to us to buy of your merchants
four or more barrells of powder yearly, with some convenient proportion of
artillery, considering our hazardous frontier situation to these Barbarians,
who from their abundant supply of arms from the Dutch (and persidious English
all the land over) are full of our artillery, which has rendered them
exceedingly insolent, provoking and threatening, especially the inlanders which
have their supply from the fort of Aurania. We have been esteemed by some of
you as your thornie hedge on this side of you; If so, yet an hedge to be
maintained: If as out sentinells, yet not to be discouraged. And if there be a
jealousy of the ill use of such a favor, please you to be assured that a
credible person in each town shall have the dispose and managing of such
supplies according to the true intent and purpose.

For the obtaining of these our just and necessary petitions we have no
inducement or hope from ourselves; only we pray you to remember that the
matters prayed are no way dishonorable to yourselves and we humbly conceave
do greatly promote the honor and pleasure of his Highness, yea of the Most
High also, and lastly, such kindnesses will be obligations on us to study to
declare ourselves, upon all occasions,

Your most humble and faithful servants. Roger Williams, President. In the
name and by the appointment of Providence Colony.
Honored Gentlemen,
I pray your patience to one word relating to myself only. Whereas, upon an
order from the Lords of his Highness Council, for my future security in taking
ship and landing in your ports, it pleased your honored then Governor Mr.
Bellingham to obey that order under his own hand, I now pray the confirmation
of it from one word of this honored court assembled.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Roger Williams to the General Court.
Boston 17.3.56. (so called) May it please this much honored Assembly,
I Do humbly hope that your own breasts and the public shall reap the fruit
of your great gentleness and patience in these barbarous transactions, and I do
cordially promise for my self (and all I can persuade with) to study
gratitude and faythfulnes to your service. I have debated with Pumham (and some
of the natives helping with me) who showed him the vexatious life he lives in,
your great respect and care toward him, by which he may abundantly mend
himself and be united in some convenience unto their neighborhood and your
service: But I humbly conceave in his case that dies et quies sanant hominem,
and he must have some longer breathing, for he tells me that the appearance of
this competitour Nawwushawsuck has stabd him: May you therefore please to
grant him and me some longer time of conference, either until your next
general assembling, or longer at your pleasures.

My other requests I shall not be importune to press on your great affairs,
but shall make my address unto your secretary to receave by him your pleasure.

Honored Gentlemen, Your humble and thankful servant, R. W.

Copy of a Letter from the Governor and Magistrates of the Massachusetts to the
Commissioners of the united Colonies, and the Proceedings thereon.
Honored Gentlemen,
THE remembrance of the solemn covenants and promises the united colonies (in
the beginning of their combination) made one with another, not only to
strengthen the hearts and hands each of other in appointing and maintaineing of
religion in its purity, but also to be assisting each to other where any
deficiency in such respects may appear, has putt us upon the pursuance of our
endeavors to discharge our duties in desireing you to consider of some such
meet way and expedient, as where any defect appears in any colony in the
right improvement of such means and ordinances as the Lord has appointed all
his to use and improve for the edification of the body whereof Christ is the
head, till his second coming.

Having heard some time since, that our neighbor colony of Plymouth, our
beloved brethren, in a great part, seem to be wanting to themselves in a due
acknowledgment and encouragement to the ministry of the gospel, so as many
pyous ministers of the gospel have (how justly we know not) deserted their
stations, callings and relations: Our desire is that some such course may be
taken, as that a pyous orthodox ministry may be restated amongst them, that so
the flood of errors and principles of anarchy (which will not long be kept out
where Satan and his instruments are so prevalent as to prevail to the crying
down of ministry and ministers) may be prevented.

Here has arrived amongst us several persons professing themselves Quakers,
fit instruments to propagate the kingdom of Satan; for the securing of
ourselves and our neighbors from such pests we have imprisoned them till they
be dispatched away to the place from whence they came, one of which, Richard
Smith, we have let out of prison to return to his family at Southampton,
whom we hope and doubt not but our neigbours of Connecticut well be careful
so to order it as he may do the least prejudice. As also that some general
rules may be commended to the several jurisdictions for the settling of
government amongst the Indians; that a general law may also be commended to
the general court to prohibit the sale of horses to Indians, or to transport
any mares beyond the seas to Barbados or otherwaise, on a severe penalty, and
that some general rules may be also commended to each general court to
prevent the comeing in amongst us, from foreign places such notorious
heretics as Quakers, Ranters, etc. and that strong waters to the Indians in
all the jurisdictions may be forbidden, that the name of God be not
dishonored. Not else but our best respects to you and earnest desires that the
blessing of the Almighty may be on all your endeavors.

Gentlemen, Your assured friends, Edw. Rawson, secretary. In the name and by
the order of the general court.
Boston, 2d Sept. 1656.
THE Commissioners having considered the premises, cannot but acknowledge the
godly care and zeal of the gentlemen of the Massachusetts to uphold and
maintain those professed ends of comeing into these parts, and of combination
of the united colonies, which if not attended in the particulars aforesaid will
be rendered wholly frustrate, our profession miserably scandelised, ourselves
become a reproach in the eyes of those that cannot without admiration behold
our sudden defection from our first principles; we cannot therefore but with
all earnestnes commend it to the wisdom and justice of the several
jurisdictions to take effectual care and make answerable provision, that
religion and the ordinances of Christ professed may be upheld and maintained,
which cannot be but by a due encouragement of an able orthodox ministry, a
discountenanceing of that which is hetrodox and an effectual course to keep
out heretics, the great engines of Satan (in these times) to overthrow the
truth, and because this business is of such high concernment to all, we shall
more particularly impart our thoughts to serious consideration.

1. First, we cannot (without breach of charity) but take it for a thing
granted generally by the inhabitants of the united colonies, that an able
orthodox ministry is a precious fruit of Christ's death, resurrection and
ascension, and necessary for the spiritual good of his people, and to be duly
sought after in every society or township within the several jurisdictions.

2. And secondly, that a competent maintenance proportionable to the ability
of the place and necessity of the minister is a debt of justice not charity.

3. Hence thirdly, the minister may justly expect it from that society and
township wherein he labors.

4. The reference or relation of a minister being to the whole society
jointly, whether in church order or not, his expectation of maintenance, and
the debt of justice, is from the whole society jointly.

5. Although the society may according to their discretion use diverse ways to
raise this maintenance, yet if the ways be ineffectual (though the defect may
be in some particular persons) the society cannot be discharged, but is the
debtor.

6. The engagement being upon the society, and that according to religion and
right reason, it necessarily follows that the society be enabled with
sufficient power to discharge it self.

7. Therefore the general court should declare such a power to be in such
societies, that there may be no pretense in them for want thereof, and if any
society or township shall be wanting, either out of neglect or opinion, to
procure and maintain as abovesaid an orthodoxe ministry according to the
gospel, we conceive (by the rules of scripture and the practice not only of
all christian governments but even of heathen who not only held their sacra in
veneration but took care of those that had the keeping of them and the charge
of making known their mysteries) the several general courts stand charged
with the care that the people professing christianity own and live according
to rules and ordinances of their profession, and that the dispensers of them be
encouraged as aforesaid. The maintenance of the ministry being a debt of
justice from the society and the society empowered to discharge it, if any
particular person shall be defective to the society they ought to be ordered
by the ordinary course of justice.

These generals we thought meet to propose, from whence we leave to the
wisdom of the general court to draw up such conclusions and orders as may
attain the end desired. And if any of the members of the said court should not
concur (at present) with our apprehensions, we do earnestly desire that by
all means they would labor to inform and satisfy themselves of the truth of
the particulars abovesaid, whereof we (for our parts) have noe doubt. We do
further propose to the several general courts that all Quakers, Ranters, and
other notorious heretics be prohibited comeing into the united colonies and
if any shall hereafter come or arrise amongst us, that they be forthwith
secured or removed out of all the jurisdictions. That some safe provision be
made against selling or giving strong lyquors to the Indians without particular
and express license from some magistrate, or other officer thereunto deputed,
and that upon some weighty cause or exigent. And that noe horse or mare, young
or old, be sold to any Indian, under the penalty of five for one.

And as to the restrainte of sending forth or transporting, that each
jurisdiction be left to their liberty.

Copy of the Case of George Giddings and others of Ipswich, referring to Mr.
Cobbet. Mr. Symonds the Justice who tried this cause was descended from an
ancient an honorable family in Yuldham in Essex, where he had a good Estate.
The proceedings are somewhat singular and the arguments give us some idea of
the notions of government prevailing in that day.

June 22. 1657. George Giddings, plaintiff, against Edward Brown, defendant.

In an action of trespass upon the case for entering his house and severing his
pewter dishes or platters and marking of them.

I find in this case for the plaintiff, Damage 0 -- 1 -- 0 Costs 0 -- 5 -- 8

And the case being of very weighty concernment in the country (I conceive) I
shall express the grounds of my judgment.

I Understand this to be about a fundamental law, and that a fundamental law
properly so called. It is such a law as that God and nature have given to a
people. So that it is in the trust of their governors in highest place and
others, to preserve, but not in their power to take away from them.

Of which sort are these, viz.

1. Election of the supreme governors.

2. That every subject shall and may enjoy what he has a civell right or title
unto, so as it cannot be taken from him, by way of gift or loan, to the use or
to be made the right or property of another man, without his own free consent.

3. That such laws (though called libertyes) yet more properly they may be
called rights, and in this sense this may be added as a third fundamental law,
viz.

That no custom or precedent ought to prevayle in any moral case, that may
appear to be sinnfull in respect of the breach of any law of piety against the
first table, or of righteousness against the second.

And for brevity sake I shall now forbear to write further, and respite what I
have more to say to be expressed in another paper, what does more clearly and
fully tend to inlighten my judgment in this case, ready to be manifested when
occasion is.

Samuel Symonds.

Edward Brown appealeth from the sentence in the case above unto the next
county court holden at Salem, and acknowledges himself bound to this
government in the sum ot three pounds to prosecute his appeal to effect,
according to the law provided about appeals.

Samuel Symonds.

At a general town meeting the 25th of February 1655. Voted to give 100 l.
toward building or buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.

This is a true copy taken out of the town book June 20th 1657. Per me
Robert Lord.

At a meeting of the select men the 13th of June 1657.
There being a vote of the town to give one hundred pounds toward building or
buying Mr. Cobbes a house, and the last seven men The same with the Selectmen.
accordingly proportioned the same upon the inhabitants, and complaint being
made by the deacons that diverse refuse to pay:

It is therefore ordered by the now select men that the marshall, Edward
Brown, shall and is hereby empowered to distrayne upon such persons (their
several sums) as refuse or delay to pay their proportion to the hundred pound
by vote of the town given to Mr. Cobbet toward building him a house.

This is a true copy out of the town book, taken the 15th of June 1657. by
Robert Lord.
We whose names, are under written do witness that this order which is above
expressed by this copy was our mind expressed by word to be entered in the
town book.

You are required to appear before me upon the second day next, at two of the
clock after noone, it being the 22d day of this instant, to answer the
complaint of George Giddings in an action of trespass upon the case for
entering his house and severing his pewter dishes or platters and marking of
them, and hereof you are not to fail at your peril. Dated the 16th day of the
4th month, anno Dom. 1657.

These coppies written on both sides this paper were examined by the originals

June 22. 1657.
A copy of the vote (in the case adjudged) as I have taken it, viz.
Voted to give 100 l. toward building or buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.

See the Record of the judgmt in the case.
WHEREAS when I gave my sentence in the case before me, between George Giddings
plaintiff, and Edward Brown defendant, in an action of trespass upon the case,
etc. I did express some grounds of my judgment to be seen in the records. Now
I shall add further what does induce me to that apprehension in the case, viz.

First, This may be given as a reason, that it is against a fundamental law in
nature to be compelled to pay that which others do give. For then no man has
any certaynty or right to what he has, if it be in the power of others (by
pretense of authority or without) to give it away (when in their prudence they
conceive it to be for the benefit of the owner) without his own consent.

Secondly, This to me is some strengthening to induce my apprehension in this
case, viz. That notwithstanding in England, it cannot be denied, but that men's
estates were sometimes unduly taken from them: Some by force, some by fraud,
some by sinister wresting of evidences, yea, and sometimes of law itself, as
about knighthood-money, shipmoney, etc. yet I dare say, if search be made into
histories, lawyers books of reports, etc. it cannot be made to appear that in
the most exorbitant times any man has had his estate taken from him as by the
gift of others, under color of law, or countenance of authority. Noe, noe,
lawyers would have blushed to have given such a construction of laws; and
suddenly their faces would have waxed pale. For the King would have been too
wise to have owned the plea. And what would all wise men have said for such
taking away the greatest outward right or liberty from them? For it may be
understood, that benevolencies, encouraging gratuities, leaves, or privy
seals, were not required by law, or by pretense of law, but desired as by
favor. However they were obtained by illegal and tyrannical means, as was
apprehended.

This I say further, and I do argue it from the greater to the less. That if
noe king or parliament can justly enact and cause that one man's estate, in
whole or in part, may be taken from him and given to another without his own
consent, then surely the major part of a town or other inferior powers cannot
do it. But show us any man that can produce any footstep for such a way,
either directly or indirectly.

But to the contrary it appears unto me. See Dalton page 401. where it is to
this effect. That the king cannot release a man out of prison (being in at a
private man's suit) to his damage, without his own consent. Also to the same
purpose see Sir Henry Finch, recorder of London, in his first book of law,
page 74, having ended his rules about native or fundamental laws, he says in
the next page, Therefore laws positive do lose their force and are noe laws
at all, which are directly contrary to the former viz. native or fundamental.

The parliament may tax (and that justly) the whole country to give a gift or
reward to one man for some service; for they are betrusted so to do. The
reason is, it is levied upon the whole country, with their consent, and for the
immediate benefitt of the whole.

But if they should do it between persons (though they should so do by
power, and the person wronged has noe remedy in this world) yet it would be
accounted tyranny. Is it not to take from Peter and give it to Paul?

If one man, for such or such a turn or good end, may justly be deprived of a
fundamental right or liberty, then an other and an other, and so every man. In
England there is but one sort of men that might be deprived of their goods;
which sort are usually called slaves but there they are called villeynes to the
lord of the manor.

Thus much concerning fundamental law, in reference to mine and thine, not to
be given or taken away without his own consent.

But now to answer some objections that may be made to the case in hand.

Objection. Suppose it be true what is expressed, and granted that he were a
strange man that should deny the same in the general: Yet, notwithstanding, it
hinders not but that a town (when and as often as they think good, in their
prudence) may do it for good ends, and so (in special cases) it may lawfully
be done in the particular, upon the law made page the 9th, that every
inhabitant shall contribute to all charges in church and commonwealth (whereof
he does or may receive a benefitt) else he shall be strayned.

Answer. I conceive that it is an extreme dishonor cast upon the general
court, to make such a construction of their positive laws as does infringe the
fundamental law of mine and thine; for it must needs be void, if it should
indeed be necessaryly construed against the right or liberty of the subject.
But the law in its true sense is good.

Before this recited law was made, though some churches, or towns rather, did
agree how much yearly maintenance the minister should have, yet it was not
rated, at least in any compellable way by the town, but men did pay their
proportion in a way of voluntary contribution. But some (especially non
members) some of them did grow slack; and so the burden grew too hevy upon
church members, etc. And upon consideration it was found lawful to make a law
to compel every one to bear his own share; forasmuch as by hearing the word
and public prayer, etc. he did or might receive a benefitt and (in a way of
God) be received as a member with the rest. And yet the law was framed so, as
such churches as chose to go in a voluntary way of weekly contribution or so,
might so continue, notwithstanding this law, as some churches in this country
do to this day.

But for the right understanding of the word benefitt in the law, it is worthy
the consideration or attendance, that benefit and necessary duty must go
together. The law both of God and the country does require people to go to the
meeting for public worship.

But it is not understood that any law does provide that every town shall buy
or build a house for the minister as often as there is a removal by death or
otherwise, I mean to be his in propriety.

Let us a little examine the point of benefitt that a man does or may receive,
as a motive to such a gift.

First, suppose or admit the giver (compelled by the act of others against his
will) should gain twenty fold thereby, viz. by the use of such a smith, or
person obtained into town, yet that does nothing at all warrant the act.

And if you should only consider matter of benefitt (not at all in this
consideration minding the point of lawfullnesse or unlawfullnesse in being
compelled to pay) though it be not material to the case (as has been said)
whether it be benefitt or not in this respect, yet then the other way voted by
the town, viz. for the ministry, according to the law provided, (by so
general if not universal consent) is to be compared with this way now
strayned for, to understand which way turns the scale for matter of benefitt.

He that lays down a sum of money in hand for work to be done, gives just
occasion for others to take into the consideration whether a man's life be so
certain or his continuance in the place and work is made so sure as that it
is a benefitt to go in that way rather than in the other: For in any matter of
this kind, rightly to understand whether so or so be a benefitt, yea or not,
both the present and future arguments must be weighed together.

Obj. But if any should object and say there is noe comparison between the
benefitt that arises by the ministers function amongst people and external
temporal goods, etc.

Ans. It is fully granted in one sense, but not in the sense of our enquiry.
Here external benefitt (in the comparison) is the thing considerable, as that
the labourer is worthy of his hire.

For if the objecter should have men otherwise to understand the matter of
benefitt, he must alter his mind upon this consideration: Whoever does but ride
through the town, and the people being met at that time, the stranger comes in
and speaks some heavenly truths amongst them: Is not this of greater value than
all the lands, houses and cattle in the town? And is it therefore legal and
binding, if the major part present do give him 100 l?

Obj. But the law urged fol. 9. expresses civil charges as well as
ecclesiastical; therefore, though it were a mischief to the commonwealth so to
interpret general sentences in positive or court laws; This is quite contrary
to the rules following for interpretatation of laws.
this law (so interpreted) will leave them out, if a town or select men shall
thereupon give, and accordingly rate and distrayne such as never consented to
their acting, to one good ditcher so much over and above his allowance for his
work by the rodd, etc. Such a smith so much, etc. For it is to the benefitt
of the town to encourage them to stay, and so be content to take the less
wages.

Answ. Amongst 200 inhabitants in a town, whereof a matter of six, or so, be
worth 2000 l. a piece, the rest do perceive that the six rich men within a
year will remove their estates out of town. The town having a general
meeting do give 300 l. to the present minister, that the proportion of the
estates of such rich men may ease themselves for the future: It is in
consideration of his staying amongst us and as part of his yearly maintenance
and for advancing the lands of the town in general, either to let out or sell
for such as come into town after such a sum laid down in hand before the
work be done. And who can deny but the rich men do or may receive a benefitt,
or some benefitt (at the least) thereby, namely, by the word of God preached,
before they do remove their estates out of town.

After this there is another tax raised by the town (there being 20 of good
estate though not near the first) for some good end, etc. and there are diverse
valuable considerations held forth, them thereunto moving, at last the few
rich men begin to perceive that they being few in number shall be levelled,
and yet comfort themselves that they cannot be made slaves in this country:
For though they be thus deprived of their estates, yet they have the words of a
law for them; and if all, in a manner, should be thus wasted, yet there is such
a way to ease them again.

Thus much touching the matter of benefitt construed and urged by the law, fol.
9,

About a bargain or contract.
Obj. Suppose it should be endeavored to be made a bargain, etc.

Ans. It is no matter to the case in question: For though it be in the power of
a person or of many (each person consenting) to make a bargain never so much to
his own loss, yet he or they must be holden to it: But otherwise it is with a
derived power or trust, being a society; for they have not such an unlimited
domination over other men's estates or persons; For, setting aside the
consideration of the fundamental law (before sufficiently spoken unto) they
are limited by statute law. And such bargains as bind the non consenters must
be just, rational, and the terms or conditions also expressed and certain:
If any of these fail noe law will bind them.

This is known, that upon motions in town meetings and other companies, some
use one argument or motive, some another. Some are moved with one argument or
consideration in his mind, some with another. And is the rule to seek then (or
only so in this case) what is the way of nations to understand the mind of
the company? Must not recourse be had to the record?

In the case in question, do the agitations end in a bargain, or in a gift?
Whatever the motives were that did incline, etc. if so expressed in terms, it
is hard work to add thereunto or to alter therefrom.

If it were so, that any man were not capable to receive a gift, it might have
some color to be interpreted to be a bargain, or contract.

But if it be an equal or rational thing to have pay laid down, or urged to
be laid down aforehand, where a call of God is acknowledged by accepting and
taking office before. And besides the knowledge of the yearly salary. knowing
also that the place was willing to expend 150 l. to buy or build a house for
the use of the ministry, which during his abode there he was to dwell in.

And when there are noe certain conditions that do provide, in case he die or
remoove within one year, or one month, his executor to return part of it to
the town, or when there is no such conditions, nor any at all expressed, and
only one party known to consent, and that as they have done, whether this can
be called a just and binding contract or bargain, yea or not, or any at all,
let the world judge.

And certain such as plead on the now defendants party must say it is either a
gift or a bargain. If this be endeavored to be a bargain or contract, it is a
very blind bargain, as they say, which (acting upon oath) I could not allow. If
a gift (for there may be motives and high considerations in the minds of the
granters to give as well as to conclude a bargain) then it does not bind such
as do not consent to be forced to pay what do move other men to give away out
of their estates.

So much about the matter of contract or consideration.

Now a little about interpretation of laws and of rules to be attended therein.
Let us not (here in New England) despise the rules of the learned in the laws
of England, who have both great helps and long experience.

1. First rule is, that where a law is such as that, by wresting, a man may
give such an interpretation as will overthrow it, when it might be construed to
be good; this is a corrupt interpretation. So holy scripture may be wrested.

Finch p. 33. in his book of law.
If repugnant to fundamental law, its void; as if it gives power to take away
an estate from one man and give it to another.

Page 75.
It is then consonant, if it be to compel men to pay necessary duties in church
and common wealth, as yearly maintenance.

2. Another rule is about equality. Hence where a company in trust does act, if
any will imply conditions (noe way expressed) yet, F. p. 20.
to hold forth any color of binding, they must be known to be equal and
certain: though a statute law should provide or express mischiefously. See
his words at large, justly applyable as is expressed.

3. Another rule appears to this effect. That where a person is sued at a
private man's suit, and put in prison upon execution, Dalton p. 401.
the king cannot pardon that imprisonment without the consent of the party plt.
and the reason is there given; for it is in lieu of damage to the party, as
has been touched before.

4. The law construeth things with equity and moderation; Finch page 55.
and therefore restrayneth a general act, if there be any mischief or
inconveniency in it.

So far touching rules for interpretation of laws.

Quest. By the way: Seeing there is so much spoken about fundamental laws and
interpretations, what may be the difference between the late Earl of
Straffords interpretations and actings against fundamental laws, and
sometimes those of other men?

Answ. Although in some things materially they should be the same, yet formally
they are not, or may not be so.

The Earl of Straffords acting was found to be a treacherous and perfidious
attempt to alter and subvert the frame of polity.

So there were these particulars in it, viz. First, his end was naughr. 2dly,
He acted arbitrarily against such laws. 3dly, It was done perfidiously, it
being done willingly.

But others acting against fundamental law, charity construeth that their end
they aim at is good. Secondly, their arbitrary construction (where it is so)
may be through ignorance, or through want of notice taking of such rules for
interpretation of laws as are expressed in the lawyers books.

Precedents and judgments in courts.
Although there had been noe precedent in the like case, yet I ought (I
conceive) to have judged, in the case in question, according to the rules
aforegoing: Notwithstanding, I grant that what I find to have been judged
already and acted, both justly and honorably, I ought to be the more confirmed
thereby.

1. In Ipswich, some years since, the town greatly wanted a good surgeon,
etc. and the inhabitants then generally being desirous of such a person to
inhabit amongst us; the chief sort consulted how to effect it. It must cost
above 50 l to bring it about.

It was concluded that it could not be justly done by way of rate, but each
man's name being drawn out (according to a rate) such as were willing did
signify the same, and the rest were left to use their liberty.

2. I am informed and do partly remember it, that some years since there was
a six acre lot in Ipswich purchased for Jeffery Snelling; but some of the
inhabitants consented not: It came it last to a suite in Ipswich court, and it
was found against the town, because by law they could not give away any man's
estate against his own consent, notwithstanding the considerations and motions
inducing.

And admit there were not such weighty considerations or benefitt as in some
other case there may be, the degree is not the point; for majus et minus non
variant speciem. Ambrose Leach the seller of the land. Daniell Clarke was sued.

3. There is yet, I conceave, a concluding argument (in the like case) in the
general court, I referr to the record itself (but till an understanding man,
then an inhabitant of Weymouth, (as I am informed) mentioned it since the
passing of my sentence in the case in question) it was out of my mind.

I remember the substance of it, and I suppose so do many more. That town of
Weymouth did generally agree to provide an house and meet accommodations for
the use of the ministry, to remain for posterity. This case was tried at a
county court at Boston, and found against the town.
The matter came into the general court. Mrs. Richards stood out, and not many
(if any more besides) and although the court did so well like their aim, or
the thing (in itself considered) as may by and by appear, yet it was judged
in court that they could not justly impose payment upone one, or more persons,
not consenting. One Dyer was then deputy of that town, and did prosecute in
behalf of the town: Yet herein the court gave a testimony of their good
liking in respect of the towns intent, viz. in that way to provide for the
ministry. And accordingly the law was framed, and enacted for the future, Page
20.
that very court.

This provision was not to give away, but to remain to posterity, and the like
provision was for every town in the country; and that which a great part, if
not the greater part, of Ipswich have desired and do still stand for.

Obj. But it may yet further be objected. That the two ways, viz. of giving a
sum, 100 l. more or less, and that of laying out 150 l. for the ministry,
whereby the present minister should have the benefitt and use during his life
(if he stayed in the place which he had formerly accepted) and after him the
same to remain to posterity for the use of the ministry, which were best is
considerable, etc. Now seeing the greater part does choose rather the latter
way, by a major vote, what great matter if the other part does not yield to it?
or why should they not yet yield to it, for the first way seems to tend most
to peace, and there is less present expense about it, etc.

Answ. The answer to this is, we are not now upon persuasive arguments, what is
least expense. etc. or what may be supposed to tend most to peace, or upon a
thing to be done: But I am to judge the case according to justice and right,
upon what is already done; wherein, according to my oath and trust, I am not to
respect persons in judgment.

Obj. But possibly some will yet further object that it was done in part of his
maintenance.

Ans. This is spoken unto already. How can this be part of that contract which
was some six weeks before, viz. that he should have 80 l. per ann. for his
maintenance, and a house was procured for him for the present, and a vote
passed to pay 150 l. to provide for him during his being in the place, and then
to leave it for such an end, etc. especially the matter being so variously
propounded and agreed as each man thought good in the meeting house.

Some saying to this effect (to promote a gift) that the minister would not
stay unless he had so much to buy or build a house for himself in propriety.
Others did adhere to the former way agreed upon. Again, some saying it were
best to procure a sum by way of subscription, viz. to put it to men to give as
the arguments did move them, in a voluntary way. Others that it might be voted,
etc.

All this while noe demandant present nor noe authority to this day appearing
to mention much less to conclude a bargain or contract.

But the result of all motions and arguments was to give 100 l. as it is
expressed in the record. From which I dare not in any wise in point of justice
receed.

Obj. Lastly, if it be objected that in that there was so great a sum given
or granted it may stumble the business, but had there been a matter of half of
it or less it would have been held good.

Ans. However too often it falls out in the world that smaller injuries or
errors are passed by, being done by the hands of such as have power in their
hands and specially if acted by such as are in supreme authority, yet such
actings were but a crooked or lesbian rule to justify an act thereby. Will it
not be yielded that majus and minus non variant speciem? If the major part can
justly give away one pound, by the same reason 100 l. yea 1000 l. If one acre
of another man's ground, his orchard also, yea his farm as well. And that
although a parliament or general court cannot do it.

Such as promise a gift it behooves them in point of conscience to make
payment (and they only it is conceived) though not as vote of the town, but as
each particular man's promise does bind himself.

Quest. If it be demanded whether there be any difference detweene disposing
men's estates by way of gift (under color of law and countenance of authority)
unto other men against or without the consent of the owners and the doctrine of
levellisme.

Ans. It may be answered (I conceive) to this effect, viz. That of the
levellers, though wicked and absurd, yet it is as yet but doctrinall (I think)
but this kind of transposeing men's estates is both doctrinall and practical
also, and so leads more directly to tyranny as it seems.

Secondly, Levellisme (I take it) reaches but to the estate, etc. But this (if
accounted legal) men may for a debt so obtained (as in other cases) upon
execution for a debt enforce the person to prison, or expose him to be sold to
make payment.

Quest. But what if there be an interpretation put upon the words of the
records, and call it a contract, will not this help the matter.

Ans. This liberty to interprett acts or records against the plain words
thereof (if it be a help) I suppose it is to make the matter worse in this
respect (if worse can be) then the doctrine of levellisme, for by their
doctrine (I think) a man may understand what they mean by their words, and
their words are used (its likely) in one fence.

But this kind of liberty of interpreting seems to countenance and strengthen
the opinion of the scepticks, which makes all things true, and so indeed
nothing true or certain. Hence when an act will serve the turn let the words
stand, else take liberty to interpret them for their purposes.

If this kind of liberty be good, either to construe laws (provided for
necessary payments) or turning gifts into contracts (as men please) then
indeed it is all one whether both parties be present when the business is in
hand or not. And though it was wont to be law that a bargain, whether it
proves gaynfull or loosing, yet being made binds both parties. But had this
vote been for 20 l. M (or so) instead of 100 l. would it be interpreted good,
binding and disanulling of the vote for the 150 l? But this was intended
doubtless by some, namely by granting a new sum to change or repeal the act
for the former way agreed on, according to the law and the towns contentment,
though herein also they did mistake, for there appears to be noe vote to
disanull the former. So that if there were diverse more graunts or gifts in
this kind, they were all additionall, and would all be gotten by suit and
distress, and if this may, justly be obtained by law.

The question unto this court is annexed under the hand of the clerk of Salem
court.

It being framed in one question by Salem court, it does consist of a compound
axiom.

Upon viewing whereof I find the paper to contain two questions distinctly
taken.

1. First, Whether the vote does bind all or any of the inhabitants of the
said town to pay any thing toward the said 100 l. 2. Secondly, Whether such
as voted not but are and were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or not?
The first of these does not concern such as refuse to pay or are defendants
in the case originally: Save that they are bound to desire that matters may be
rightly understood and judged. Not doubting but the court sees a manifest
difference between a man's being bound in private conscience to perform his
own promise, and being legally bound by a vote of a town. For a town or
court cannot or need not distinguish of particular persons who is for the
affirmative, who not. But how many, etc. Its the validity of a major part's
vote is in question; not the personal vote of this man or of that.

The latter does properly concern the said defendants. For payment whereunto,
or accordingly, they are sued and their goods distreyned. And the case is now
come to this court for resolution.

The order of the town of Ipswich, its proceeding in reference to the answers
in question was to this effect, viz.

At a meeting in Ipswich October 55, about the time of Mr. Cobbetts coming to
town, there was a vote past to pay 80 l. per ann. for his maintenance.

Also there was another vote of the town expressing their willingness to
disburse a sum not exceeding 150 l. to provide for the ministry.

And there was a meeting of the town in February following (being about six
weeks after Mr. Cobbett was ordained) upon much agitation to and fro there was
a vote past in these words, viz. Voted by the town to give 100 l. to buy or
build a house for Mr. Cobbett.

It is conceived that the view hereof does afford argument for further clearing
and confirming (if need were) of what is argued for in this paper.

To conclude this matter, I thank God, I am for ordinances both in church and
common wealth; and consequently for due means for the upholding of them (and
do account it not only a great wickedness to be contrary-minded, but extreme
folly and madness) and I think it tends to the honor of them, when, in
reference thereunto, provision is made either in a voluntary or else in a way
of compulsion, grounded upon such principles as both here and in other nations
will be owned as just and equal.

I do sometimes remember what is said of Levy. In point of right and truth, he
took noe notice of father or mother. And that is the way to establish love and
peace in this our Israel. And the holy scripture does oblige the doctrine and
practice of piety according to the first table, and of distributive justice in
the second, both expressly, or by necessary consequence, at the hands of such
as are called to dispense the same, though they take not oath so to do.

It is supposed that noe man is come to New England to have his goods given and
taken from him, unto, or for what good end, or under what pretense soever.

If this should be confirmed for good law; henceforth then (I conceive) there
will be noe more need, or little, to make any more propositions for voluntary
contributions.

Vote of the General Court.
AT a general yearly meeting of the inhabitants of the town of Ipswich 25
Feb. 1655, voted to give one hundred pounds toward building or buying a house
for Mr. Cobbett.

The Question being put, Whether this vote does bind all or any of the
inhabitants of the said town to pay any thing toward the said 100 l. and
whether such as are unwilling may be compelled thereunto or no? The deputies on
a hearing of the reasons alleged on both sides, and on serious consideration
of the same, have resolved in the negative, with reference to the judgment of
our honored magistrates herein.

20th 8th 1657. William Torrey Cleric.
The magistrates consent not heereto.

Edward Rawson, Secretary.



To the honored General Court now assembled.
WHEREAS it has pleased God in the way of his providence to exercise the town
of Ipswich with great troubles, by removing those reverend elders which they
formerly enjoyed, it pleased God in our straits by the help of our honored
Governor, Deputy Governor and several of the reverend Elders, to provide for
us an able help in the work of the Lord among us, our rev. pastor Mr. Th.
Cobbet, whom now at present we enjoy. After he was come amongst us, we came in
a church-meeting to consider how to provide for his maintenance, in which we
conceive a house must be provided for him. Then the case came to be propounded
to the town in a general towne-meeting, where being some agitations about it,
there passed a vote, which is here expressed.

Voted to give 100 l. toward the building or buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.
Which vote was full and clear; and afterward there was a proportion made by
the selectmen of the town upon the several inhabitants. But there being
diverse of them that refused to pay their proportion, the deacons came to
consider with the selectmen what to do about it, and they ordered the marshall
to distreine one, or two. He was sued in an action of trespass before our
honored magistrate Mr. Samuel Symonds, from whose judgment he appealed to
Salem court; where the parties appearing, were desired by the court to cease
prosecution and to let the question be stated by the court and presented to the
general court. Which was accordingly consented unto. Which we humbly entreat
this honored court to take into their consideration.

A copy of the order of Salem court.
WHEREAS there were several actions commenced at this court by some of the
inhabitants of Ipswich, which were of great and general concernment. And the
court fearing the usual manner of proceedings would not put a comfortable
issue to the said cases, propounded to the parties that the question in
controversy might be stated and presented to the general court for resolution,
which should determine the particular actions and all others that might arise
upon the said question, which question was by the court stated with the consent
of parties, and is as follows.

At a general yearly meeting of the inhabitants of the town of Ipswich Feb.
25. 55. voted to give 100 l. toward building or buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.
The question is, Whether this vote does bind all or any of the inhabitants of
the said town to pay any thing toward the said 100 l. and that such as are or
were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or no? And it is agreed that
either party shall have liberty to present their reasons, in writing, to the
general court, pro and con. But no other pleadings by either party to be
allowed.

According to which liberty we present as follows.

The question has two parts, 1. Whether the vote be binding. 2. Whether such
as refuse may be compelled.

The first being proved, the other will easily follow.

Reasons tending to prove the affirmative.
The vote is legal, therefore binding. It is legal in respect of the matter
and manner. For the matter, it is necessary, public town charges, viz.
honorable maintenance of the ministry, which the law requires in general, but
leaves to each town to determine and apply in particular, suitable to their
own condition; provided they are subject to be regulated by higher authority,
where need shall require. This honorable maintenance, we conceive, cannot be
less than that a minister, for his labor in preaching the gospel, (whatever
estate he has of his own) should have such a recompense whereby he may be
enabled comfortably to provide for the present necessity of his family, to be
given to hospitality, and to leave some comfortable provision for his family
after his decease, as other men by Gods blessing upon their ordinary labors
are generally enabled to do. This being granted which (we hope) seems but just
and reasonable, that ministers families may not be left in a worse condition
than most other men's, the particular way and manner of affording this
maintenance (where there are variety of apprehensions) must necessarily be
determined by the major part. So it was in our case, and the town pitched upon
what is expressed in the vote, the due fullfilling of which is necessary and
justifiable upon these grounds.

1. The usual yearly allowance will not reach the former end, viz. to afford
any provision for a ministers family after his death.

2. This has been a common practice among ourselves formerly, and in other
places in the country less able, not only to give their first but succeeding
ministers a dwelling house, or somewhat proportionable that way.

3. This we perceived would be most acceptable, and might rationally be
expected, and the other way propounded, of providing a house merely for use,
would not be acceptable, as not being usual in the country, and apprehended
prejudicial to the familyes of ministers after their decease.

4. The sum given is not so great as to exceed the end for which it is
granted, or to burden the town in payment of it, and other less sumes being
propounded, this was freely chosen and resolved on.

This for the legality of the vote in respect of the matter and substance of it.

For the manner. It was a lawful meeting, free liberty of debate being given,
and at last concluded by the far major part, very few opposing it either in
debate or voting.

Thus the vote appearing legal, we conceive it binding, and being so, we
conceive the town has power to compel such as refuse to yield to it, by
virtue of a law enacted and established by the general court, p. 9. providing
that all common charges to church and commonwealth may be compelled by
assessment and distress.

To conclude, we hope and persuade ourselves that our brethren are one with us
in their love and desire to encourage an able godly ministry among us, and will
judge it safest and suitablest both to the mind of God and the godly zeal and
religious care of our honored general court, to be open, rather then
strait-handed that way: And that we would not be justly taxed for, nor
exemplary in, the least discouragement of that nature, and that we agree in the
end, only differ about the means of attaining it.

This 22 of the 4th mo. 1657.
FOrasmuch as there is a case in controversy concerning a sum of money,
containing one hundred pounds, voted by some in a town meeting to be given to
Mr. Cobbet for his particular use to buy or build him a house, we whose names
are underwritten (promising due reverence to the person fore mentioned)
conceiving ourselves not to be obliged by a major vote in an act of that
nature, not being involved in that act; we here crave leave, as without offense
unto any, to declare our dislike of it, we never acting in it nor gave any
encouragement thereunto, seeing noe reason so to do; yet do we declare
ourselves freely willing to contribute as we are able to a convenient
habitation for the use of the ministry to remain the towns to posterity,
according to the wholesome laws established by the honored general court,
provided it may be excepted acknowledged and recorded to belong to the town
for that end, according as is provided in the said recited law, for which end
there being a towne-meeting called quickly after Mr. Cobbet came to Ipswich,
many of us know there was a vote then passed to raise a sum of money not
exceeding one hundred and fifty pounds, which has not bin as yet demanded,
etc. Signed by a great number of the inhabitants of Ipswich.


At the Court held at Salem 1.5. 1657.
WHereas there were several actions commenced against several of the
inhabitants of Ipswich which were of great concernment and the court fearing
the usual manner of proceeding would impede a comfortable issue to the said
cases, propounded to the parties that the question in controversy might be
stated and presented to the general court for resolution, which determine the
particular actions and all others that arise upon the said question, which
question was by the court stated with the consent of parties and is also as
follows, At a general yearly meeting of the inhabitants of the town of
Ipswich, 25 Feb. 1655, voted to give one hundred pounds toward building or
buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.

The question is whether this vote does bind all or any of the inhabitants of
the said town to pay any thing toward the said hundred pounds, and that such
as are or were unwilling may be compelled thereunto yea or not. And it is
agreed that the parties shall have liberty to present their reasons in writing
to the general court pro and con, but noe other pleading by either party to
be allowed.

Veria copia, per Elias Stileman, Cleric.
Voted by the whole court 21st October. 57. On the affirmative. E. R. Sec.
This case thus signed by the officers of the county court at Salem, was
presented to the general court sitting at Boston, 14th of October. 1657, was at
the perusal of the reasons alleged by both parties taken consideration of,
the question resolved in the affirmative.

This is a true coppie. The great doubt in this long case seems to have been
whether an act of the supreme authority, impowering the major part of the
inhabitants of a town to tax the minor part which did not consent to the tax,
was not contrary to the fundamental laws in government. It must be remembered
that many of this minor part were not voters in town affairs, neither in person
nor by any representative of their own constituting. The arguments are as
strong against taxes by the General Court as by a Town, and yet the House of
Representatives (p. 304) voted that the tax made by the Town was not binding.
In a day or two after they altered their mind. There was a division in the
colony at this time upon the mode of maintenance of ministers, any other way
except by voluntary contribution being opposed by many, of whom Mr. Justice
Symonds seems to have been one.




Copy of a Letter from Governor Endecott to John Leverett, Esquire Agent in England.
Sir,
I Cannot write unto you by a more faithful friend then I have done, who is
able at large to relate unto you how things in general stand here. And that
does save me some labor which at this time is a favor to me. For in this
extremity of heat, and that after a long sickness, I am very faint, not fit
to do any thing, yet I cannot but, by these, heartily salute you in the Lord,
giving you many thanks for what you sent me. For all good news is welcome to us
as you know full well. Yet I cannot for the present answer your expectation
touching Road-Island and Clark and Holmes, Clark and Holmes were Baptists. They
had both been fined and one of them whipped, refusing to submit to the fine.
but I have acquainted the rest of the magistrates with your letter who are all
ready to gather up sufficient testimony to prove what you spoke to the
Protector, and enough to satisfy (we doubt not) your opponent, if he be a
lover of the truth. Only we would have the general court act with us therein,
which will not meet till September next, when I hope I shall procure a full
answer to your former and last letters. What the end is of that point of state
to make the Protector king I cannot fathom it, unless their proffering and his
denial thereof ingratiate him the more in the hearts of he people. The Lord in
mercy guide all to his glory and the good of those common wealths over whom
he has set him. If there be an opportunity I pray write a word or two about
it, and other occurrences that may fall out. I cannot be sufficiently
thankful for what you writ unto me last. Great motions there are in the
world, which the Lord direct and turn to his glory, the overthrow of his
enemies and the peace and welfare of his own people. Which is the prayer of

Sir, Your very loving friend and servant, Jo. Endecott,

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Leverett to Governor Endecott.
Sir,
YOURS of the 29th, 4th, 57, by my wife, was all I received the last year past
from your worship or the honored court, save only one, at the same time, from
Mr. Secretary as a cover to a petition and some papers concerning the actings
of Providence men and Cheesmans rescue from the marshall. The reason I suppose
has been the miscarriage of Mr. Garrat, A ship with many passengers of note
and effects of great value which sailed from New Haven. Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p.
85.
whom has not as yett been heard of, so that I have not been capable of
attending any those commands that might be by you sent unto me by him; and as
the state of affairs has hapened there has not been any prejudise; for
although upon the sitting of the last parliament, at their meeting in January,
I receyved intelligence of something prepareing to be moved in the house
respecting the eastern parts under your jurisdiction, whatever it was, it met
with prevention by his Highness the Lord Protectors dissolving of that assembly,
so that as yet I have not heard of any thing moved to his Highness nor council,
though some are soliciting to that end, but so soon as any thing is upon
motion I shall hear of it, and doubt not but to give such answer as shall
hinder any proceeding that might be to the prejudize of your government. Sir,
There lately past an order of the council to be confyrmed by his Highness, for
the impowering of you, calling to your assistance such as you shall judge meet,
for the examination of the accounts presented by me to his Highness and
council, which was kept by Mr. Tho. Lake, concerneing the forts, the which
with a letter unto you will not have dispatch by this ship, by the next it may,
which will be about a month or six weeks hence; the favor that I crave from
your worship is, that you will please to give a dispatch thereunto, for that
though an order is passed for my receipt of the money due upon the said
account, yet I am necessitated, upon what ground I know not, to give in bond
for the making payment, of what shall appear due to be repayed upon that
account to the state. When the order is completed and your letter, I shall
make bold to give you further trouble herein for news.

London, 16 Ap. 1658.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Leverett to Governor Endecott.
Sir,
THESE are to accompany a letter from his Highness and council to you,
impowering of you to examine the accounts kept by Mr. Tho. Lake, and presented
by me, of disbursements and receipts for the carrying on his Highness service at
the forts taken from the French in America, a hint whereof I gave you by my
last of the 16th current; in the letter you are required to call Col. Temple or
give him notice thereof, by whose occasion it is, as I suppose, that I meet
with this trouble, and if he have nothing of desygne but the gayneing of time,
upon the state, for his paymecnt acording to his engagements (the which some of
his instruments has confessed to me was aimed at by him) I know not why he
should found his own accommodation upon my real prejudize at present, though I
know the Lord can turn it to advantage. Sir, my desire is that you will
please to give me favor by your dispatch; for though I may get an order for my
money, yet not without giveing good security by bond, the which I must have lie
out until return from you. Mr. Tho. Lake kept the accounts (I have only had
the honor in disburseing the money and am like to have the trouble in getting
of it in) What I presented to his Highness and council I had from Mr. Lake
subscribed by him, and is what I doubt not his ability and readynes to clear
up whatever may be objected by any, (I know not of any thing unjustly charged
either debtor or creditor) he sent vouchers for what was charged, which past
the examination of the commissioners of the navy; the principals or coppies I
suppose he has in his hands ready to produce at your command. I shall not
further enlarge, but still press for a dispatch, that return may be made by
you to the council what you find therein, and that you will be pleased to
favor me with a copy thereof, which is noe more than I have had from all
referees to whom my business has been referred from time to time; and this I
mention, not questioning your readynes to favor me what justly you may, but
that what I do desire is customary and allowed to all in their busynes.

Sir, I shall send another letter from his Highness and council, as also of
these by another conveyance, for that I had twoe letters of the same date
sygned and sealed at the same time delivered me to convey because of the hazard
of sea passage. Not further to trouble but with my humble service remain Sir
your humble servant,

Honored Sir,

yett have received no line from you, yett cannot but by so fit an opportunity
and messenger present my best respects to you and your wife, and acquaint you
that our general court in June last wrote a letter to his Highness the Lord
Protector in answer unto his, which however they brake up and gave me no order
about it, yet have I enclosed it with a copy thereof unto you, and desire your
faithful and speedy delivery thereof, as per the contents you will perceave
there is need. I hope when our court meets again in October there will be a
more full account and particular relation thereto. Here being no news with us
but what the bearer, your special good friend and couzin, Mr. Edw. Ting, cann
and will give you more ample satisfaction in than if I had specified the same,

Boston, 13 Sept. 1658.
Copy of a petition of the inhabitants of York, Kittery, Wells, etc. presented
27th of October 1658, to his Highness the Lord Protector.
To his Highness the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and
Ireland, and dominions thereunto belonging.

The humble petition of several the inhabitants of the towns of York,
Kittery, Wells, Saco and Cape Porpus, sometimes under the provincial
government of Main and Lygonia, now under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts
in New England,

Humbly shows,
WHEREAS as information does report unto us of several addresses lately made
unto your Highness, by some gentlemen of worth, for restitution of their right
of jurisdiction over us, claimed by their patents, the determination whereof
(we humbly conceive) after a legal hearing, rests upon your pleasure, wherein
ourselves not being so properly concerned as others, at present, do purposely
wave, craving only to present your Highness with a true narrative, though
implicit, of our first and last estate, before and since we had this
government which through Gods mercy we now enjoy to our good satisfaction, and
for our continued setlednes under it we daily pray, for these reasons.

First, Because of ourselves we have small power to carry on government, being
a people but few in number, and those not competent persons to manage such
weighty affairs, our weakness occasioning distraction, our paucity division,
our means contempt, as our own former experience has fully evinced to the
total subverting all civil order amongst us.

2dly, Because chainges cannot reduce things from impossibilityes to make
things, of such as are not, to be, the case is ours, the places of our
residence admit but of small enlargement, the generality of the country from us
eastward is so confusedly taken up with uninhabitable beings of sterile lands,
swamps, and rockey mountains, as not more than a few shreds are left by the
sea shore fit for cohabitation, and those already populated by an
inconsiderate number of people. How the wisest of such who desyer
superintendency over us can settle a well governed commonwealth upon such basis
we leave to your wisdom to judge.

3dly, Because changes in these times may prove dangerous, where discontented
spirits wait for such opportunityes, which have not been the least part of
that small number amongst us who were professed royalists, whose breathings
that way, since our subjecting to this authority, have been so far stifled, as
that the activity of such spirits cannot find any, or the least opportunity of
motion.

4thly, Because we fear the hurtfulnes of our change. As our government now
is, our persons and estates stand under the security of wholesome laws,
watchful governors, the fathers of our nourishment and peace, whose pyous care
not only tollerates but maynetaynes us the purest institutions for the
encouragement of godly persons, both ministers and others, to reside amongst
us, but changing it may throw us back into our former estate, to live under
negligent masters, the dainger of a confused anarchy, and such other
inconveniencyes as may make us a fit shelter for the worst of men, delinquents
and ill affected persons to make their recourse unto, thereby to exempt
themselves from their just deserved punishments.

5thly, Changes are apt to inihilate, unless they prove much for the better,
especially in weak boddyes, where heads are far remote; touching such events
our former experience has taught us something, else we crave of those
gentlemen who are now so solicitous for government over us, what meant the
deepness of their silence several years, both in their tongues and penns, as
not after our frequency of writing to them they not so much as return us one
sylable of answer, or afford us the least assistance in government; the want
whereof let us sincke into great distractions, for our recovery thence several
amongst us petitioned for government to the collony of the Massachusetts, who
after some debate with us and confirmation of some articles of agreement to us,
took us under their authority, unto which we subscribed and subjected
ourselves, and under whose protection to continue we account it not the least
part of our security and happiness.

6thly. Because we conceave the confyrming the Massachusetts pattent in its due
extent, in respect of its antiquity, nuls all after pattents whatsoever, as
fully in titles of lands as of government, from both which we expect aequal
freedom by their just interests and our own subjection.

Our humble request therefore is, that your Goodness would favor our
reasonable entreatyes, whose weakness calls for support, our manners for some
strictness of rule, whose distractions for some present settlement wherein our
voate is that it may be as it is under the government of the Massachusetts,
against which if changes should interpose our inevitable troubles would follow.
Our condition as it was in part, and as it now stands, lies really before your
gracious eye, although not so methodically presented, for which we hope our
ignorance will excuse us. Touching which if your Highness expect any further
information we beseech your commands herein for a pyous and reverend friend of
ours, Mr. John Wheelwright, sometimes of us, now in England, unto whom our
estate is well known and is able fully to sattisfy any enquiries therein.

Craving pardon for our overmuch boldness and prolixity, as our duties are, so
pray we for the Almightys protection to secure your person, his spirit to
guide, his gracious blessing to crown your high and memorable endeavors with
continued succes for the advancement of his own glory and kingdom, and your
happiness here and eternally.

Copy of a Letter from Capt. John Leverett to Mr. Secretary Rawson.
Worthy Sir,
YOURS of 13 September received with the enclosed to his Highness the Lord
Potector, dated 10th June 58. Now such was the good pleasure of the Most High,
that the Protector, whose commands occasioned that letter in return, was
gathered to his fathers before that came from you, he dyed the 3d September.
Upon the 4th his eldest son the Lord Richard was proclaimed Protector, to whom
I made my application on the behalf of the country that day fortnight after;
again, upon receipt of the general courts letter, I applied myself to his
Highness and presented the said letter the 27th day of October, he was pleesed
to open and read the letter in my hearing, and then gave me assurance as
formerly that he had a deep sense how dear the people of N. E. were to his
dear father, and that he should be ready in all things to lay forth himself
for the good of that people. After my humble thanks returned on the countries
behalf, I presented a copy of the petition from Pascataqua and York
inhabitants (Mr. Godfrey being active about his complaints, the which he still
prosecutes and has procured a reference) his Highness said he would read the
same and consider thereof at more leisurable time than he had at that present;
so that I doubt not but whatever Mr. Godfrey may do we shall be able to give
such answer as to prevent prejudice to the courts actings as to those parts.
For the letter his late Highness sent, it was procured by a gentleman attends
his Highness; it being drawn up and made ready for signing, and so took his
opportunity; the secretary has promised if any thing in future be upon motion
refering to the country I shall have notice thereof while I abide here: For
state of affairs at present, we are at peace and the great chaynge has as
yett little of the face of chaynge in it; his present Highness gayneing upon all
that apply themselves to him; writs for a parliament are out; calling them
according to the old manner as in anno 40; they are to sit the 27th January;
the Dutch sending Lord Opdam with a fleet of nigh 40 sail and 4000 men to
assist the Danes, was encountered by the Sweeds and well battered; vice admiral
De Wit, the best commander the Dutch has, mortally wounded, taken his ship and
all in her, six more the Dutch lost, most disinabled, their admiral Opdam
hardly escaping with 5 foot water in hold; since this conflict his Highness has
sent a fleet of 20 sail of fregates, under the command of vice admiral Gadson,
to assist the Sweed; Sir George Ascue with 300 English commanders and officers
gone with him to be commanders in the Sweeds fleet; but the frost in those
parts has been so hard that neither one nor the other could seize the land, as
its said. The English agent, Mr. Downing, Sir George Downing, who a few years
before went from New England.
and French has put in their memorandums at the Hague, in name of their
masters, that the Dutch desist assistance to continue hostilities between the
notherne kings, and to provoke them to endeavor a mediation. Upon which the
Dutch have recalled some forces intended and are upon sending to mediate a
peace.

Copy of a Letter from the Commissioners of the united Colonies to Peter
Stuyvesant the Dutch Governor at Manhattoes. Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 159.

Much honored Sir,
WE presume you have heard from the people of the fort of Aurania, that some
of the English have been lately in those parts upon discovery of some meet
places for plantations within the bounds of the pattent of the Massachusetts
colonie. which from the latitude of 42 or 42 and 30 minutes, and so northerly,
extends itself from east to west in longitude through the maine land of
America from the Atlanticke ocean to the south or west sea. And we understand
that the government of the Massachusetts have granted liberty to some of
their people to erect a plantation in these parts and intend to effect the
same, yet without intrenchment upon the Dutch rights, and foreseeing some
difficulties to begin a plantation such a distance by land and that the
passage up Hudsons river would very much accommodate them in their design,
we have thought good on their behalf to desire liberty of free passage for
their said planters by your towns and forts upon the said river to the said
land, they demeaning themselves peaceably and paying such moderate duties as
may be expected in such cases, which being so concordant to reason and the
custom of civil nations living in amity, does beget in us a confidence that
you will be very slow (by an unreasonable denial) to interrupt the neighbourly
correspondency that has been betwixt the English and Dutch colonies: For the
exact bounds of the Massachusetts pattent we leave to that government to
clear, only we conceive the agreement at Hartford, that the English should
not come within ten miles of Hudsons river does not prejudice the right of the
Massachusetts in the upland country, nor give any right to the Dutch there,
that agreement intending only the differences betwixt Conecticott and Newhaven
and yourselves on the sea coast, there being at that time no difference
between you and the Massachusetts, and neither Conecticott or Newhaven
pretending any right to the lands up the country within the line aforesaid.

Sir, be pleased to return your answer to Mr. Endecott, governor of the
Massachusetts, from whom we may understand your resolution. The Lord direct
your thoughts to ways of peace, that amity and good neighborhood may be
continued with

Sir, Your loving friends and neighbors, The Commissioners of the united
Colonies. Signed by all the Commissioners.
Hartford, 7 Sept. 59.
Copy of a Letter from the General Court to Mr. John Leverett in London.
Sir,
WE have received your letter of October 58, with the petition of Mr. George
Rigby, etc. have considered the contents of both, and have herewith sent you a
copy of our patent, and of the extent of our line taken by artests, with
several other writings and letters to friends in reference thereunto, which we
desire and hope may be improved to our advantage, and judge it convenient, if
there be a fit opportunity and friends propitious for us, that it may be a
speedy issue. Some considerations we thought good to suggest, which you may
make use of as there shall be occasion; as first, from the express words of
the pattent that determines our northerly bounds, which our general court has
always understood to mean as you know, as also one other passage in the
pattent where it is said that any thing of doubtful interpretation shall be
understood in favor of the patentees. 2dly, At our first coming hither into
this wilderness, and for some years after, multitude of occasions in the
beginning of so great an undertaking did hinder our exact taking notice of our
laying claim to the utmost extents of our limits, especially to the norward,
nor had we for some time after our coming hither occasion to make use thereof,
yet did we never set up our bounds 3 miles east of Merimack, as the petition
mentions, but as occasion was given have always asserted the same limits that
now we claim, though we knew not certainly (till trial made) where it would
fall. In the mean time, several persons procured pattents of certain tracts
of land within the limits formerly granted us, all or most whereof were
obtained surreptitiously and illegally, and afterward ordered and governed as
unduely, the pattentees chiefly aiming at trade or private profitt, neglecting
the chief end intended, and declared in his Majesty's original grant, whence
it came to pass that there were several petty governments, sometimes by
pattent, sometimes by combination, and sometimes the people left in distraction
and confusion without any, and in great danger and hazard of shedding one
another blood, whereupon first diverse of the inhabitants of Paskataqua, about
the year (...) petitioned this court that as they were conceived to be within
our line, so they might be actually taken in and governed by us, which
accordingly was done by commissions sent from this court, with the consent and
good liking of all the inhabitants and persons interested therein, and so have
continued with much satisfaction, living in peace and enjoying the fruit and
benefitt of good government to this day. In the year (...) we took a more
exact survey of our limits, and finding these easterly parts mentioned in the
petition to fall within our pattent (which is more ancient and more authenticke
than any other pretended to by the petitioners) we made declaration thereof to
the inhabitants residing within the aforesaid precincts, being likewise
petitioned so to do by diverse of the inhabitants beyond Paskataqua river, now
called Yorkshire, and after some agitation and conference with the rest of the
people there, we came to a friendly and amicable conclusion, that as they were
within our pattent so they would forever be subject to this government, wherein
they are well satisfied and find the benefitt thereof, as their petition to
his Highness does declare; nor was it matter of profitt that moved us hereunto,
for we have neither received or expected any thereby, but the obligation of
duty that lay upon us to see the people within our pattent governed according
to God, and has been our diligent care and endeavor, and so shall always
be, that all just possessions and improvements shall be preserved and confirmed
to the true proprietors there, as it is amongst the rest of the inhabitants
that have been under our government from the beginning. There are several
other scattered inhabitants that live betwixt our line and Colonel Temple's,
some whereof observing the benefitt their neighbors have reaped by good
government, have offered themselves to us, which yet we are slow to accept of,
because without our limits, which we desire not to enlarge, but conceive it
would much conduce to the peace and wellfaire of the English in these parts, if
they were laid to Col. Temple's jurisdiction or this, if his Highness please so
to order it (as we have intimated in our letter to my Lord Fienes, etc.)

Concerneing those letters from persons of honor, alleged by Mr. Godfrey to
have been sent to the governor and magistrates in favor of him, we never
received and so could return no answer, and for himself, he was one of those
that did submitt to this government, accepted of commission from hence and
took the oath of freemen, and that without any force or compulsion at all,
none being used toward him or any other, as is unduely suggested in the
petition; and it is no strange thing that Mr. Winslow, Mr. Dudley, etc. should
long since, before our limitts were exactly known, seem to own those for
distinct governments which in truth were none, but included in this of ours, as
upon the running of our line did manifestly appear.

Sir, the governor and magistrates ordered me to forbear sending the copies
mentioned in this letter till the next ship, the ship being nigh under sail.
Accept of my service to you and good Mrs. Leverett, who am

Sir, Your truly honoring friend, Edward Rawson, Secretary. By order of the
General Court.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Leverett to Governor Endecott and the General
Court.
London, 13 September 1660. Sir,
IT may seem a kind of immodest importunity in me to reitterate my scribbles
to you as I have done and not have any return, or a sylent charging of your
neglect of your and the countries concerns that neither myself nor any other
for you can hear from you; the consideration whereof had almost wrought me to
a resolve of neglecting this opportunity of presenting my due respects in
giveing you any account of others motions in England concerneing you; but least
you should have cause of chargeing me with neglect I have set pen to paper, to
let you understand what I hear in relation to New England. The complaynants
against you to the Kings majesty, as I am informed, are Mr. Godfrey and that
company, Mr. Reckes and Sefford and company of iron works, some of the
sometimes fined and imprisoned petitioners, who thought, first, to have made
their complaynts severally, after, resolved in joint by petition; moved to have
the quakers and anabaptists joined but they refused. I have endeavored to have
a sight of their petition but cannot procure it; but am informed that, having
mentioned the articles they petition for, the distance of place does not admit
of a way of heareing as being nigher it might. They move that a general
governor may be sent to give relief to them. To this petition they get what
hands they can of persons that have been in New England, though never
inhabitants. The quakers I hear have been with the King concerneing your
putting to death those of their friends executed at Boston. The general vogue
of people is that a governor will be sent over. Other rumors there are
concerneing you, but I omit them, not knowing how to move and appear at court
on your behalf, I made bold to address myself to the Lord Say and desired his
favor that in case of complaynts to his majesty he would be your friend, so
far as to desire his majesty that you might be heard before any thing were
determined concerneing you as to judgment. His lordship professed his great
respect for the plantations and thanked God he prayed for you daily, promising
to improve his interest according to my motion. I likewise addressed myself to
the Earl of Manchester, Lord Chamberlain, who promised the like. By the ships
that are expected I perceive that some of those that complain do expect that
you will empower some to appear for you, and thereupon make some demurr in
their prosecution, but if that be not, then they intend to have something done
against the spring of the year. The peace with Spain was proclaimed in London
11th instant, upon the same articles concluded in his late majestyes time.
Episcopacy, common prayer, boweing at the name of Jesus, sign of the cross in
baptism, the altar and organs are in use and like to be more. The Lord keep
and preserve his churches that there may not be fainting in a day of trial.
With the presentment of all due respects, begging your prayers, commend you to
the great God, and remain

Yours in all faithfulness to serve you, John Leverett.
Some quakers say that they are promised to have order for the liberty of being
with you.



Copy of a Letter from Governor Endecott to Capt. John Leverett in London.
Sir,
BY the former ships you will receive letters to two noble persons, by this we
have sent a petition to his Majesty, and a petition to the parliament, for the
delivery and prosecution whereof we have thought meet to desire your help,
and our former experience of your readiness therein, which we cannot but with
much thankfullnes acknowledge, does persuade us to rely upon your fidelity of
improving your interest and pains so long as your own occasions shall detain
you there, for which we shall not only acknowledge ourselves your debtors but
be ready to discharge ourselves by the first opportunity when your own
occasions shall call you thence. We have desired Mr. Saltonstall and Mr.
Ashurst to take the care of the prosecution of our business according to the
instructions which we herewith send, which we desire you to attend and shall
pray for your good acceptance and success therein, and remain,

Boston 19th October 1660. Sir, Accept of my respects and service to you and
your wife. These only are copies of the former sent by Mr. Kullams vessel and
Col. Croune. I pray hasten the delivery of the petitions, nothing else, but
that I am,

Your assured though afflicted friend, Edw. Rawson, Secr.



Copy of the General Courts Address to the King.
To the High and Mighty Prince Charles the second, by the Grace of God King of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Most gracious and dread sovereign,
MAY it please your Majesty, in the day wherein you happily say you know you
are King over your British Israel, to cast a favorable eye upon your poor
Mephibosheth, now and, by reason of lameness in respect of distance, not until
now appearing in your presence, we mean upon New England, kneeling with the
rest of your subjects before your Majesty as her restored King. We forget not
our ineptness as to these approaches; we at present own such impotence as
renders us unable to excuse our impotency of speaking unto our Lord the King;
yet contemplating such a King who has also seen adversity, that he knows the
hearts of exiles, who himself has been an exile, the aspect of Majesty,
extraordinarily influenced, animateth exanimated outcasts, yet outcasts as we
hope for the truth, to make this address unto their Prince, hoping to find
grace in your sight. We present this script, the transcript of our loyal
hearts, into your royal hands, wherein we crave leave to supplicate your
Majesty for your gracious protection of us in the continuance both of our
civil as of our religious liberties (according to the grantees known end of
suing for the pattent) conferred upon this plantation by your royal father.
This, this, viz. our liberty to walk in the faith of the gospel with all
good conscience, according to the order of the gospel (unto which the former
in these ends of the earth is but subservient) was the cause of our
transporting ourselves with our wives, little ones, and our substance, from
that pleasant land over the Atlantic ocean into the vast wilderness, choosing
rather the pure scripture worship with a good conscience in this remote
wilderness among the heathen, than the pleasures of England with submission to
the impositions of the then so disposed and so far prevailing hierarchy, which
we could not do without an evil conscience. For this cause we are this day in
a land which lately was not sown, wherein we have conflicted with the
sufferings thereof much longer than Jacob was in Syria. Our witness is in
heaven that we left not our native country upon any dissatisfaction as to the
constitution of the civil state. Our lot, after the example of the good old
nonconformists, has been only to act a passive part throughout these late
vicissitudes and successive overturnings of states. Our separation from our
brethren in this desert has been and is a sufficient bringing to mind the
afflictions of Joseph: But providentiall exemption of us hereby from the late
wars and temptations of either party we account as a favor from God; the
former clothes us with sackcloth, the latter with innocence. What reception,
courtesy and equanimity, those greater, and others, adherers to the royal
interest, who in their adverse changes visited these parts, were entertained
with amongst us, according to the meaness of our condition, we appeal to their
own reports.

Touching complaints put in against us, our humble request only is, that for
the interim, while we are as dumb by reason of our absence, your Majesty would
permit nothing to make an impression on your royal heart against us, until we
have both opportunity and leave to answer for ourselves: Few will be innocent,
said that impleader, if it be enough to deny: Few will be innocent, said the
then Emperor, if it be enough to accuse. Concerning the quakers, open and
capital blasphemers, open seducers from the glorious Trinity, the Lord Jesus
Christ, our Lord Jesus Christ, the blessed gospel, and from the holy
scriptures as the rule of life, open enemies to the government itself as
established in the hands of any but men of their own principles, malignant and
assiduous promoters of doctrines directly tending to subvert both our church
and state, after all other means for a long time used in vain, we were at
last constrained for our own safety to pass a sentence of banishment against
them, upon pain of death. Such was their dangerous and impetuous and desperate
turbulence both to religion and state civil and ecclesiastical, as that how
unwillingly soever (could it have been avoided) the magistrate at last, in
conscience both to God and man, judged himself called for the defense of all,
to keep the passage with the point of the sword held toward them, this could
do no harm to him that would be warned thereby, their wittingly rushing
themselves thereupon was their own act, we with all humility conceive a crime
bringing their blood upon their own head. The quakers died, not because of
their other crimes how capital soever, but upon their superadded presumptuous
and incorrigible contempt of authority breaking in upon us, notwithstanding
their sentence of banishment made known to them; had they not been restrained,
so far as appeared, there was too much cause to fear that we ourselves must
quickly have died or worse, and such was their insolency that they would not be
restrained, but by death; nay, had they at last but promised to depart the
jurisdiction, and not to return without leave from authority, we should have
been glad of such an opportunity to have said they should not dye. Let not the
king hear men's words, your servants are true men fearing of God and the king,
not given to change, zealous of government, order, orthodox and peaceable in
Israel; we are not seditious as to the interest of Caesar, nor schismatics as
to the matters of religion, we distinguish between churches and their impurity,
between a living man, though not without sickness or infirmity, and no man;
irregularities either in ourselves or others we desire to be amended, we could
not live without the public worship of God, nor permitted the public worship
without such a yoke of subscription and conformities we could not consent unto
without sin. That we might therefore enjoy divine worship without humane
mixtures, without offense to God, man, our own consciences, with leave but not
without tears departed from our country, kindred and fathers houses into this
Pathmos, in relation whereunto we do not say our garments are become old by
reason of the very long journey, but that ourselves, who came away in our
strength, are by reason of long absence many of us become grey-headed, and some
of us stooping for age. The omission of the prementioned injunctions together
with the walking of our churches as to the point of order, the congregationall
way is it wherein we desire our orthodox brethren would bear with us.

Sir, We lie not before your sacred Majesty. The Lord God of Gods, the Lord
God of Gods knows, and Israel he shall know, if it were in rebellion or
schism that we wittingly left our dwellings in our own country for dwellings
in this strange land, save us not this day.

Royal Sir, If according to this our humble petition and good hope, the God of
the spirits of all flesh, the father of mercy, who comfort the abjects,
shall make the permission of the bereavement of that all (for which we have and
do suffer the loss of all precious, so precious in our sight) as that your
royal heart shall be inclined to show unto us the kindness of the Lord in your
Highnesses protection of us in those liberties for which we hither came, which
hitherto we have here enjoyed, upon Hezekiahs speaking comfortably to us, as
sons, this orphan shall not continue fatherless, but grow up as a revived
infant under a nursing father, these churches shall be comforted, a door of
hope opened by so signal a pledge of the lengthning of their tranquillity,
these poor naked Gentiles, not a few of whom through grace are come and coming
in, shall still see their wonted teachers (with encouragement of a more
plentiful increase of the kingdom of Christ) amongst them, and the blessing
of the poor, afflicted (and yet we hope) a people trusting in God, shall come
upon the head and heart of that great King who was sometimes an exile as we
are, With the religious stipulation of our prayers we, prostrate at your royal
feet, beg pardon for this our boldness, craving finally that our names may be
enrolled amongst

Your Majesty's most humble subjects and suppliants, John Endicot, Governor. In
the name and by the order of the general court of the Massachusetts.

Copy of the General Court's Instructions to Capt. John Leverett their Agent in
England.
At a General Court held at Boston in New England, 19th December 1660.
Instructions for our honored and loving friend Captain John Leverett, or in
his absence Richard Saltonstall and Henry Ashurst, Esqrs.
1. TO take the first opportunity that may be, in the best and most acceptable
manner, to deliver the petitions, herewith sent, to his Majesty and high court
of Parliament.

2. To interest as many gentlemen of worth in parliament, or that are near his
Majesty, as possibly you may, to own and favor our cause, and to beget in
them a good opinion of us and our proceedings.

3. By all possible means to get speedy and true information of his Majesty's
sense of our petition and of the government and people here, together with the
like of the parliament.

4. If the King or parliament should demand what those privileges are which
we desire the continuance of, your answer may be, all those which are granted
us by pattent and that we have hitherto enjoyed in church and common wealth,
without any other power imposed over us, or any other infringement of them,
which would be destructive to the ends of our coming hither. As also that no
appeal may be permitted from hence in any case civil or criminal, which
would be such an intolerable and unsupportable burden as this poor place (at
this distance) are not able to undergo, but would render authority and
government vain and uneffectuall, and bring us into contempt with all sorts
of people. And if you find the King and parliament propitious to us, to use
your utmost endeavors for the renewing that ordinance that freed us from
customs 10th March 42. Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 114.


5. Upon any matter of complaint, by any of his Majesty's subjects or others,
relating to the bounds and limitts of our pattent, our humble desire is that
we may have notice thereof and liberty to answer for ourselves (before any
determination or conclusion be made against us) which being done, we shall
finally acquiesse in such issue as his Majesty, the high court of parliament,
or any substituted by them, shall put thereto.

6. If any particular be alleged relating to the iron-workes, the answer is,
It was first heard and judged in an inferior court and afterward upon a full
hearing and due consideration by the general court, who gave judgment
impartially, according to the pleas and evidences then produced, and shall be
ready, if desired, upon new evidences and better pleas to allow another hearing
thereof, and for further and more particular answer hereunto we must referr
you to what you know or has binn formerly informed from hence.

7. Concerning our proceedings against the Quakers, our answer is contained in
our printed declaration and petition to his Majesty, which we hope will
satisfy, but if there should be any design to encourage their coming hither
or his Majesty be induced to permit them their liberty here (which God
forbid) we entreat you, above all things else, to use your utmost interest to
prevent, as being destructive to our being here and so contrary to our
consciences to permit, and no less oppression of us than the destroying both
us and ours by the sword.

8. To give us as full intelligence as may be by the first opportunity of all
matters that concern what you conceive necessary to be done for our advantage.

9. If any objection be made that we have forfeited our pattent in several
particulars, you may answer that you desire to know the particulars objected
and that you doubt not but a full answer will be given thereto in due season.

10. Finally, It is our meaning that if in public you or either of you be
called to answer to these or any other particulars, that you give them to
understand that we could not empower any agent to act for or answer in our
behalf, because we could not foresee the particulars wherewith we should be
charged, but these are only private intimations to yourselves, which we desire
you to make use of for our indemnitie as you best may in a more private way and
personal capacity.

By the court, Edward Rawson, Secretary.

Copy of the Elders Advice about the Addresses. A great number of Addresses
were drawn and laid before the Court, but all were exceptionable, which
occasioned this call to the Elders for Advice.

Present, Mr. Willson, Mr. Mather, Mr. Syms, Mr. Norton, Mr. Elliott, Mr.
Higginson, Mr. Thatcher, Mr. Shephard. Mr. Allen, Mr. Wilson, jun.
WHEREAS it pleased the honored court to recommend some things to the
consideration and advice of the elders here present, about the addresses
intended, etc.

1. We acknowledge Gods singular presence with the honorable council in what
has bin already written to those honorable persons.

2. That our allegiance and subjection to the kings majesty is to be
acknowledged (as formerly it has bin) and is contained in the pattent itself,
according to the true meaning thereof.

3. That an address to the king his majesty, or to the parliament, or both
together (things circumstanced as they are) as seems good to the discretion
of the court, is meet and seasonable.

4. It is doubted by the most whether we be called (at this time) to declare
(or pronounce) our judgment as concerning the confusions by past however
grievous.

5. That all due acknowledgement is to be made of the kings majesty in that
high and sovereign place, or most rightful throne, is meet and necessary, yet
how high the congratulations should be, considering things present and the
sequels thereof (to God only known) we cannot apprehend.

6. Excepting what is here hinted (and some other lesser passages) we do
embrace the draught made by Mr. Norton, This was not accepted by the Court, The
Address p. 325 was.
whose great and good pains therein we cannot but thankfully acknowledge,
conceiving also the other writings to that end, to be pertinent and
thankworthy, likewise.

This paper was presented by Mr. John Wilson, sen. to the honored court in the
name of the elders present. as attests, Edward Rawson, Secr.

Copy of a Letter from his Majesty King Charles II. to Governor Endecott.
CHARLES, R.
Trusty and well beloved.
WE greet you well. It having pleased almighty God, after long trialls both of
us and our people, to touch their hearts, at last, with a just sense of our
right, and by their assistance to restore us peaceably and without blood to the
exercise of our regal authority for the good and welfare of the nations
committed to our charge. We have made it our care to settle our lately
distracted kingdoms at home, and to extend our thoughts to increase the trade
and advantages of our colonies and plantations abroad. Amongst which as we
consider New England to be one of the chiefest, having enjoyed and grown up in
a long and orderly establishment, so we shall not come behind any of our royal
predecessors in a just encouragement and protection of all our loving subjects
there, whose application unto us, since our late happy restoration, has been
very acceptable, and shall not want its due remembrance upon all seasonable
occasions; neither shall we forget to make you and all our good people in those
parts equal partakers of those promises of liberty and moderation to tender
consciences expressed in our gracious declarations; which though some persons
in this our kingdom of desperate, disloyal and unchristian principles, have
lately abused to the public disturbance and their own destruction, yet we
are confident our good subjects in New England will make a right use of it, to
the glory of God, their own spiritual comfort and edification. And so we bid
you farewell. Given at our court at Whitehall, the 15th day of February 1660,
in the thirteenth year of our reign.

Will. Morris.

Copy of a Report made to Governor Endecott by Thomas Kellond and Thomas Kirk.
Two young Merchants lately from England who were employed to make search for
Whaley and Goffe, and seem to have been sincere in endeavoring to apprehend
them, but care was taken that it should not be in their power.

Honorable Sir,
WE according to your honors order departed in search after Col. Goffe and
Whaley (persons declared traitors to his Majesty) from Boston May the 7th,
1661, about six a clock at night, and arrived at Harford the 10th day and
repaired to Governor Winthrop and gave him your honors letter and his
Majesty's order for the apprehending of Col. Whaley and Goffe, who gave us an
account that they did not stay there but went directly for New Haven, but
informed us that one Simon Lobden guided them to the town. The honorable
Governor carried himself very nobly to us, and was very diligent to supply us
with all manner of conveniences for the prosecution of them, and promised all
dilligent search should be made after them in that jurisdiction, which was
afterward performed. The 11th day we arrived at Guildford and repaired to the
Deputy Governor, William Leete, and delivered him your honors letter and the
coppie of his Majesty's order for the apprehending of the aforesaid persons,
with whom at that time was several persons. After the perusal of them, he
began to read them audibly, whereupon we told him it was convenient to be
more private in such concernements as that was; upon which, withdrawing to a
chamber, he told us he had not seen the two Colonels not in nine weeks. We
acquainted him of the information we had received that they were at Newhaven
since that time he mentioned, and thereupon desired him to furnish us with
horses, etc. which was prepared with some delays, which we took notice of to
him, and after our parting with him out of his house and in the way to the
ordinary, came to us one Dennis Scranton and told us he would warrant that
Col. Goffe and Whaley. at the time of his speaking was harbored at the house
of one Mr. Davenport, a minister at New Haven, and that one Goodman Bishop of
the town of Guildford, was able to give us the like account, and that, without
all question, Deputy Leete knew as much, and that Mr. Davenport had put in ten
pounds worth of fresh provisions at one time into his house, and that it was
imagined it was purposely for the entertainment of them.

And the said Scranton said further, That Goffe and Whaley should say that if
they had but two hundred friends that would but stand by them, they would not
care for Old or New England: Whereupon we asked him if he would depose to that:
He replied he would, that it was openly spoken by them in the head of a
company in the field a traineing. Which words was also confirmed by several
others, as also information that Goffe and Whaley was seen very lately
betwixt the houses of Mr. Davenport and one Jones, and it was imagined that one
lay at one of their houses and the other at the others. Upon which we went
back to the Deputies and required our horses, with aid, and a power to search
and apprehend them; horses was provided for us, but he refused to give us any
power to apprehend them, nor order any other, and said he could do nothing
until he had spoken with one Mr. Gilbert and the rest of the Magistrates: Upon
which we told him we should go to New Haven and stay till we heard from
him, but before we took horse the aforesaid Dennis Scranton gave us
information, there was an Indian of the town wanting, which he told us was to
give notice of our comeing. But to our certain knowledge one John Megges was
sent a horseback before us, and by his speedy and unexpected goeing so early
before day was to give them an information, and the rather because by the
delays was used it was break of day before we got to horse, so he got
there before us; upon our suspicion we required the Deputy that the said John
Meggs might be examined what his business was that might occasion his so
early goeing: To which the Deputy answered that he did not know any such
thing, and refused to examine him; and being at Newhaven, which was on the 13th
day, the Deputy arrived within two hours or thereabouts after us and came to
us to the court chamber, where we again acquainted him with the information
we had received and that we had cause to believe they were concealed in
Newhaven, and thereupon we required his assistance and aid for their
apprehension: To which he answered that he did not believe they were. Whereupon
we desired him to empower us, or order others for it. To which he gave us this
answer, That he could not, nor would not make us magistrates: We replied, we
ourselves would personally adventure in the search and apprehension of them in
two houses where we had reason to imagine they lay hid, if they would give way
to it and enable us: To which he replied, He neither would, nor could not do
any thing until the freemen were met together. To which we set before him
the danger of that delay and their inevatable escape, and how much the honor
and service of his Majesty was despised and trampled on by him, and that we
supposed by his unwillingness to assist in the apprehension, he was willing
they should escape: After which he left us and went to several of the
magistrates and were together five or six hours in consultation, and upon
breakeing up of their counsel, they told us, they would not nor could not do
any thing until they had called a general court of the freemen: Whereupon we
represented to them your Honors and Governor Winthrops warrants as
presidents, who upon the receite of his Majesty's pleasure and order concerning
the said persons, stood not upon such niceties and formallities, but
endeavored to make all expedition in seizing on them, if to be found in their
government, and also how your honor had recommended this grand affair to
him, and how much the honor and justice of his Majesty was concerned, and how
ill his sacred Majesty would resent such horrid and detestable concealments
and abettings of such traitors and regicides as they were, and asked him whether
he would honor and obey the king or not in this affair, and set before him
the danger which by law is incurred by any one that conceales or abetts
traitors; to which the Deputy Leete answered, we honor his Majesty, but we
have tender consciences.

To which we replied, that we believed that he knew where they were, and
only pretended tenderness of conscience for a refusal: Upon which they drew
into consultation again, and after two or three hours spent, in the evening
the Deputy and Magistrates came to us at the head of the stairs in the
ordinary, and takes one of us by the hand and wished he had binn a plowman and
had never binn in the office, since he found it so weighty.

To which we told them, that for their respect to two traitors they would do
themselves injury and possibly ruin themselves and the whole collony of
Newhaven, and still continuing to press them to their duty and loyalty to his
Majesty, and whether they would own his Majesty or not, it was answered,
they would first know whether his Majesty would own them. New Haven was a
government formed by a voluntary Combination, without any Charter, or
Commission, or authority whatsoever from the Crown, or other Powers in England.


This was the substance of our proceedings, there was other circumstantiall
expressions which are too tedious to trouble your honor withal, and which we
have given your honor a verbal account of, and conceive it needless to insist
any further; and so findeing them obstinate and pertenaceous in their contempt
of his Majesty, we came away the next day in prosecution after them,
according to instructions, to the Governor of Manadas, from whom we received
civil respects and a promise, if they were within his jurisdiction, we should
command what aid we pleased, but for sending of them according to your
honors request, he could not answer it to his masters at home, but if they
came there he should give your honor timely notice: Whereupon we requested
his honor the Governor of Monada to lay a restraint upon all shipping from
transporting of them, which he promised should be done, and also to give
order to his fiscall or chief officer to make private search in all vessels
for them that were going thence.

Upon which, we findeing any other means would be ineffectuall, we made our
return hither by sea, to give your honor an account, and to which (when your
honor shall require it) are ready to depose to the truth of it, and remain

Sir, Your honors humble servants, Thomas Kellond, Thomas Kirk.

Boston May 29th 1661. 30th May 1661.
Mr. Thomas Kellond and Mr. Thomas Kirk having delivered this paper to the
Governor as their return, in answer to what they were imployde, deposed
before the Governor and Magistrates that what is there expressed is the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Per Edward Rawson, Secretary.



Copy of a Letter from Secretary Rawson to William Leete, Esquire Governor of
New Haven Jurisdiction.
Honored Sir,
THE council of our jurisdiction being assembled the 4th instant at Boston,
ordered me to signify to you what lately they have received from England by
Captain Leverett, his letter bearing date 12th April 1661, who tells us that
however our address to his Majesty came seasonably and had a gracious answer,
yett many complaints and claims are multiplied against us, and that we are
like to hear from his Majesty's committee what those complaints are, and what
is expected from us; that an oath was produced against him for saying that
rather then we should or would admit of appeals here, we would or should
sell the country to the Spaniards; which though he absolutely denied that ever
he so said, and that if he should have so said he had wronged the country very
much, some of the said committee said the words if spoken they were pardoned,
but they looked at the words not so much his as the spirit of the country, and
though again he desired that the country might not suffer, in their minds, for
what he knew was so much and so far from them, as to think ought in any such
respect, yet one of them proceeded to question him, whether if we durst we
would not cast off our allegiance and subjection to his Majesty; He answered,
he did apprehend we were honest men and had declared in our application to his
Majesty the contrary, and therefore could not have such thoughts of us without
the breach of charity; that it is no less than necessary we had some able
person to appear for us, well furnished to carry on our business, which will
not be without money; that the council for plantations demanded of him whether
we had proclaimed the King and whether there was not much opposition to the
agreeing of our application. He answered he knew not, only had heard Capt.
Breaden say so, but humbly submitted to their consideration, that neither we
nor any other were to be concluded by debates but by our conclusions, which
were sent and presented to his Majesty in our names. They took notice, from
enquiry, that it was only from one colony, namely, Massachusetts, and have
their considerations of the other colonies neglects, to speak most favorably
thereof. Thus far as to the letter. Further, I am required to signify to you
as from them, that the non attendance with diligence to execute the Kings
majestys warrant for the apprehending of Colonel Whaley and Goffe will much
hazard the present state of these colonies and your own particularly, if not
some of your persons, which is not a little afflictive to them. And that in
their understanding there remains no way to expiate the offense and preserve
yourselves from the danger and hazard but by apprehending the said persons, who
as we are informed are yett remaining in the colony and not above a fortnight
since were seen there, all which will be against you. Sir, Your own welfare,
the welfare of your neighbors, bespeake your unwearied pains to free
yourselfe and neighbors. I shall not add, having so lately by a few lines from
our Governor and myself looking much this way communicated our sense and
thoughts of your and our troubles, and have as yett received no return, but
commend you to God and his rich grace, for your guidance and direction in a
matter of such moment, as his Majesty may receave full and just sattisfaction,
the mouths of all opposers stopped and the profession of the truth that is in
you and us may not in the least suffer by your actings is the prayer of

Sir, Your assured loving friend, Edward Rawson, Secretary.
Boston 4th July 1661. In the name and by order of the council.

Sir, Since what I wrote, news and certain intelligence is come hither of the
two colonells being at New Haven from Saturday to Monday and publicly known,
and however it is given out that they came to surrender themselves and
pretended by Mr. Gilbert that he looked when they would have come in and
delivered up themselves, never setting a guard about the house nor endeavoring
to secure them, but when it was too late to send to Totocut etc. Sir, How this
will be taken is not difficult to imagine, to be sure not well; nay, will not
all men condemn you as wanting to yourselves, and that you have something to
rely on, at least that you hope will answer your ends? I am not willing to
meddle with your hopes, but if it be a duty to obey such lawful warrants, as I
believe it is, the neglect thereof will prove uncomfortable. Pardon me, Sir,
its my desire you may regaine your peace (and if you please to give me notice
when you will send the two colonells) though Mr. Wood Green is bound hence
within a month, yet if you shall give me assurance of their coming I shall not
only endeavor but do hereby engage to cause his stay a fortnight, nay 3
weeks, rather than they should not be sent, expecting your answer, remain

Sir, Your assured loving friend and servant, Edward Rawson.



Copy of an Address from the General Court to King Charles II. This Address,
though it passed the whole Court, I don't find to have been sent. I have
several others which were prepared on this occasion in much the same sort of
Rhetoric.

To the high and mighty Prince Charles the second, by the grace of God King of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith.
Illustrious Sir,
THAT majesty and benignity both sat upon the throne whereunto your outcast
made their former address, witness this second eucharistical approach unto the
best of kings, who to other titles of royalty common to him with other gods
amongst men, delights herein more peculiarly to conform himself to the God
of gods, in that he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted, neither has he hid his face from him, but when he cried he heard.

Our petition was the representation of an exiles necessities, this script
gratulatory and lowly is the reflection of the gracious rays of christian
majesty. There we besought your favor by presenting to a compassionate eye
that bottleful of tears shed by us in this Jeshimon: Here we also acknowledge
the efficacy of regal influence to qualify these salt waters. The mission of
ours was accompanied with these churches sitting in sackcloth, the reception of
yours was as the holding forth of the scepter of life.

The truth is, such were the impressions upon our spirits when we received an
answer of peace from a gracious, from our gracious soveragne, as transcends the
faculty of an eremitical scribe. Such, as though our expressions of them need
pardon, yet the suppression of them seems unpardonable. A desert condition,
in some sense, is an object fittest to magnify princely radiance, inferior
whereto cannot make the wilderness rejoice. Opake bodies occasion the most
luculent reflections. Affection makes a rhetorician. Craesus's dumb son speaks
to prevent misery, and Zedaciah's tongue breaks loose to acknowledge mercy.
It was a day wherein your people, who had forgot prosperity, the people, the
joy of whose heart was long ceased, was revived in the matters of their God.
Life from death is so much the more sweet. Gospel liberty, truly so called,
is sweeter than life, especially when rescued from its contrary more bitter
than death, and yet more edulcorated when resented as a signal pledge of the
kindness of the Lord in that evangelical promise kings shall be thy nursing
fathers. It was a good day, and we should not do well to hold our tongue as
concerning the heart consolations of your sad abjects, the affectionate
benedictions of your most serene highness tempered with tears of joy, when
warmed with the influence of your royal favor they, by way of congratulation,
comforted themselves that the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the Lord
has escaped their pits of whom we begin to say, under his shadow we shall
live amongst the heathen.

We are deeply sensible of your Majesty's intimation relating to instruments
of Satan, acted by impulse diabolical. Venner (not to say whence he came to us)
went out from us because he was not of us. God preserve your Majesty from all
emissaries agitated by an infernal spirit, under what appellation soever
disguised. Luther sometime wrote to the senate of Mulhoysen to beware of the
wolf Muncer.

Royal Sir, Your just title to the crown enthronizeth you in our consciences,
your graciousnes in our affections; that inspireth unto duty, this
naturalizeth unto loyalty. Hence we call you Lord, hence a savior.
Mephibosheth, how prejudicially soever misrepresented, yet rejoices that the
King is come in peace to his own house. Now the Lord has dealt well with our
Lord the King, may New England under your royal protection be permitted still
to sing the Lords song in this strange land. It shall be noe grief of heart
for the blessing, of a people ready to perish, daily to come upon your
Majesty, the blessing of your own people, who (not here to allege the
innocence of our cause, touching which let us live no longer than we subject
ourselves to an orderly trial thereof) though, in the particulars of
subscription and conformity, supposed to be under the hallucinations of weak
brethren, yet crave leave with all humility to say, whether the voluntary
quitting of our native and dearest country be not sufficient to expiate so
innocent a mistake (if a mistake) let God, Angels, your Majesty and all good
men judge,

Now he, in whose hand the times and trials of all men are, who has made your
Majesty remarkably parallel to the most eminent of Kings both for the space
and kind of your troubles, so as that very day cannot be excepted wherein they
drove him from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying go serve other
gods, make you also (which is the crown of all) more and more like unto him in
being a man after Gods own heart, to do whatsoever he will; yea, as the Lord
was with David, so let him be with your most excellent Majesty, and make the
throne of King Charles the second both greater and better than the throne of
King David, or than the throne of any of your royal progenitors.

So shall allwaies pray Great Sir, Your Majesty's most humble and loyal
subjects.
10 August 61. The deputyes approve of this letter to be sent to his Majesty
(the third section between the lines drawn only excepted) with refference to
the consent of our honored magistrates hereunto.

Copy of a Declaration of the Commissioners of the united Colonies concerning
Whaley and Goffe.
WHEREAS it appears by his Majesty's order directed to John Endecott, Esquire
governor of the Massachusetts and to all other governors and magistrates in
New England, and by him communicated to the respective governors of the united
colonies, for the apprehending of Edward Whalley and William Goffe, who stand
convicted of high treason for the horrid murder of his royal father, as is
expressed in the said order, and exempted from pardon by the act of indemnity;
in obedience whereunto dilligent search has been made for the said persons in
the several colonies (as we are informed) and whereas, notwithstanding, it is
conceived probable that the said persons may remain hide in some parts of
New England, these are therefore seriously to advice and forewarne all persons
whatsoever within the said colonies, not to receive, harbor, conceal or
succor the said persons so attainted, or either of them, but that as they may
have any knowledge or information where the said Whalley and Goffe are, that
they forthwith make known the same to some of the governors or magistrates
next residing, and in the mean time do their utmost endeavor for their
apprehending and securing, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost
peril. And we do hereby declare that all such person or persons, that since
the publication of his Majesty's order have wittingly and willingly entertained
or harbored the aforesaid Whalley and Goffe, or hereafter shall do the like,
have and will incur his Majesty's highest displeasure, as is intimated in the
said order, and will be accounted enemies to the public peace and wellfaire
of the united colonies, and may expect to be proceeded with accordingly.

By the commissioners of the united colonies at their meeting at Hartford,
Sept. 5. 1661. John Mason, Samuel Willis, William Leete. Thomas Prince, Simon
Bradstreete, Daniel Denison, Thomas Southworth,


Proceedings of the Committee of the General Court appointed for the dispatch
of Agents to England. The colony at this time was divided upon the expediency
of sending agents to England. The Governor and Deputy Governor were against it,
and though appointed to be of the committee declined acting. The agents
themselves seem to have been pressed into the service. They feared a long
detention in England and were not sure that they were entirely free from danger
of restraint upon their liberty. Complaints had been preferred against the
colony from all quarters. Mr. Bradstreet had been a magistrate from the
beginning. It was well known that the elders or clergy used to be consulted and
had great influence in every affair of moment, and Mr. Norton was of that order
and of great note. Besides, it was doubtful what would be the fate of the
charter. If taken away they would not know where to obtain satisfaction for any
extraordinary expense or trouble in England.

The proceedings of this committee contribute to a just idea of the state of
the colony at this period.



4 January 1661.
At a meeting of the committee at the Ancor tavern in Boston, in reference to
the dispatch of the worshipful Simon Bradstreete and the reverend Mr. John
Norton, messengers appointed by the general court to be sent to England.

Present, Daniel Gookin, Esquire Thomas Danforth, Esquire Capt. Eliazer Lusher, Capt.
Edw. Johnson, Mr. Joseph Hill.


The committee sending to the Deputy Governor, desiring his presence and
assistance at this meeting, desired he might be excused and came not.

IT is ordered by this committee that the gentlemen chosen at the last and this
sessions of the general court to raise money for the accommodating of the
messengers appointed to go for England to negotiate with his Majesty in
behalf of the country, be hereby desired and empowered to raise four hundred
pounds sterling to be paid unto Simon Bradstreete, Esquire and Mr. John Norton at
London, within thirty days after their arrival there, and also procure letters
of credit for the said messengers to take up in London what money more they may
have occasion to use, not exceeding the sum of three hundred pounds. And it is
further desired that the said committee be secret in the management of this
affair, so far as they possibly may, especially respecting the quantity of
money procured. And further, we advise and direct that the said some or somes
of money be transmitted into the hands of Mr. Henry Ashurst, in trust for the
purposes aforesaid, as also the said committee are to take care that the said
persons be honorably and comfortably accommodated with provisions for the sea
and other necessaries in that respect and for their passages, and keep an
account of such disbursments to be delivered unto the treasurer of the
country, who is hereby ordered to make payment of the same together with
security for the other somes according to the general courts order.

The committee having sent for the gentlemen appointed to raise moneys and make
provisions as in the order above mentioned, Capt. Thomas Savage, Mr. Hezekiah
Usher, Capt. Wm. Davis, and the Secretary appearing had the said order
communicated to them and promised to endeavor accordingly.

The committee spent the rest of this day and the 5th discoursing with the
elders of the church of Christ in Boston and in writing a letter to them and
the church to desire their concurrence with the vote of the general court for
the sending the reverend Mr. John Norton, The first of these letters was from
the general court, bearing date the 3d January 1661.
their teacher, with the worshipful Mr. Bradstreete into England, to negotiate
the countries affairs with the Kings Majesty, and also writing other letters
to other churches, desiring their neighbourly assistance and help in their
turns as to supplying of Mr. Nortons absence, which last was not sent forth,
the church of Boston otherwise ordering their supply.

7 January 1661.
The committee meeting again together, at the Ancor tavern in Boston,
according to their agreement or adjournment,

Present, Capt. Gookin, Mr. Danforth, Capt. Lusher, Capt. Johnson, and Mr.
Joseph Hill.


The Dep. Gov. being again desired to afford the committee his presence and
assistance, desired to be excused.

IT is ordered that the Secretary do forthwith transcribe the records of the
court referring to the proceedings of the court concerning Gorton and his
company, Road Island, the Ironworkes, the Quakers, Piscataqua, Dr. Child and
his company, Mr. Hieldersham, the Lords letters about appeals, Reasons
political for these plantations, two coppies of the pattent, Petition to the
King, and such other as he shall see needful to give a right understanding of
the grounds of the courts proceedings about the same.

There being great reason that Mr. Bradstreet should have an opportunity to go
and visit his family and set things in order there, that he might, as soon as
may be, give up himself to the prosecuting of the courts desire to effect, the
committee adjourned to the 18th instant, at the Ancor tavern.

18th of January 1661.
The committee met together at the place.

Present, Capt. Gookin, Mr. Danforth, Capt. Lusher, Capt. Johnson, Mr. Joseph
Hill.


AT which meeting Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton presented the propositions here
under writ to the consideration of the committee.

1 Q. Whether the asserting the countries privileges of patent so large as the
last petition expresses be convenient?

2 Q. Whether the committee have power to leave out or alter the said petition,
because the courts order requires to keep the sense and substance of what the
court have agreed on?

3 Q. Whither the committee may and will engage, in the name of the court, to
make good all such damages as shall befall them by means of any complaint or
proceedings in England against them on behalf of the country, or as they are
the countries commissioners, whilst they shall there abide on the countries
service?

4 Q. Whether the Deputy Governor declining the assistance of the committee,
and the Governor manifesting himself, since the court, unwilling to the
present sending (as some have suggested) are not just impediments to the
proceedings at present, and ground of discouragement?

The committee perusing the questions returned the answers underwritt.
In answer to the 1st and 2d questions.

Whereas the petition to the King, agreed upon by the general court in their
last sessions, was to be presented to our commissioners consideration, and
therein they expressed themselves doubtful of the convenience of some passages
therein mentioned, which at this distance cannot be resolved to satisfaction,
we judge meet to leave and do here conclude and order that it shall be at
their liberty to present the other petition agreed in the former session, in
case they shall judge it more conducing to attain the preservation of the
countries just liberties and privileges than the latter, and that the names of
Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton be inserted in both the first petitions; adding
these words after the words suspended laws (as to death and corporal
punishment.)

To the 3d Question our answer is affirmative.

To the 4th Question our answer is negative.

By order of the committee, Edw. Rawson, Secretary.
18 January 1661.
Boston, January 18th 1661.
A writing being exhibited by the honored commissioners of the general court
for negotiating of our affairs with the king's majesty and his most honorable
council. The tenure whereof was as follows.
THE honored general court not having leisure to communicate, unto their
messengers intended, the matter of their mission with an opportunity to
consider thereof, and upon its communication by the honored committee their
appeared these ensuing and unexpected difficulties.

1. Two of the magistrates either not giving their placet, or signifying their
non-placet as to the mission at this time, the governor and deputy governor
being two of them, and though members of the committee, yet declining so much
as to own the business with their presence.

2. The very substance of the message, doubted even by the greater part of the
committee (so far as appears to us) to be inexpedient to the end, if
presented at this time, in conjunction with the courts instruction to the
committee not to recede from the substance of what has been agreed upon by
them.

3. The seeming difficulties of preparing any message, as becomes, in the
straight of time remaining.

4. The hazard of the undertaking, in the judgment of the honored committee, so
sensible thereof as that they thought meet to order the messengers (whose
coming cannot be hid) yet upon their arrival to abide hidden and forbear any
public management of affairs until protection for their persons may be
obtained from his majesty, a practice obnoxious to manifold inconveniences.

We in respect of the premises (that we may have, upon occasion, to answer
for and sattisfie ourselves in time to come) do conceive it our part and duty
not to conceal the prementioned discouragement, but thereupon to offer to the
committees solemn consideration whether it be not more elligible to improove
the power committed to them, rather for the deferring then for the putting on
the present mission intended, touching which question, if they incline to the
negative, we hope the best, but if after all they shall still determine for
the affirmative a meet message with other requisites provided, we hope we
shall not be wanting to the duty of patience therein, though destitute of that
encouragement which was fundamental to our acceptance, and in defect whereof
our hope was that the authority of this colony would not have expected this
service from us, fiat voluntas dei.

Boston 18. 11mo. 1661. Simon Bradstreet, John Norton.

To which the Committee returned this answer.
THE committee, taking the premises into their serious consideration, cannot
but look upon it as a humbling providence of God toward his poor people, that
whilst they are endeavoring (and as they hope in some measure of sincere love
to the Lord his truth and ordinances) to wait on God in the use of all lawful
means left unto them for the preservation of such high favors as in sundry
respects he has been pleased to betrust us withal, that so many clouds should
hover over our heads for the darkning our paths, and stumbling blocks
appearing in our way to hinder the same, yet nevertheless being persuaded that
not only prudentiall arguments referring to our own peace and safety, but also
the honor of the Lords name, church and ways, which is now principally shot
at by our adversaries, does call aloud upon us not to delay the use of all
lawful means, and this propounded being upon mature councills in sundry
debates agreed upon as the best expedient conducing to such an end, do account
it their duty (the said objections notwithstanding) to further the said
gentlemen in the discharge of the trust reposed in them, and cannot consent to
any unnecessary delay therein.

Further briefly to the several parts.

To the first, The committee do indeed concur with the commissioners that a
more full and explicit acting of the said honored gentlemen, were very
desirable, but yet not essentially necessary. The honored governor having
manifested himself willing not only to give his approbation to such commission
instructions and particulars as shall be orderly agreed upon, as also to sign
the same according to the appointment of the general court.

To the second, The committee conceive there is no doubt on their part as to
this message, nor yet any inconsistency of what they have propounded with what
the general court agreed upon, but such as may be rationally interpreted to be
the true meaning of the power committed to them.

To the third, The committee do conceive they are already agreed of the
message, viz. the commissions instructions and petitions as in the former
returns.

To the fourth, That as yet no act has been passed by them of such tendency,
only some proposals, where they have rather expressed their tender respect
toward our honored and dear friends, than any just reason that they have for
the entertaining such fears.

Finally, the committee do propose as a further expedient for the satisfaction
of our honored commissioners, that they themselves would be pleased to consider
and present unto us what themselves apprehend there yet remains to be done by
us for their furtherance in this so great an undertaking, and we hope we shall
not be found wanting to their encouragement in what we may.

By order, Edw. Rawson, Secr.

The committee appointed by the general court for the furtherance of the
negotiation with his Majesty do order that the ship Society be stayed on the
public charge, until such time as the commissioners nominated by the court be
ready to go aboard, and accordingly declared themselves to Mr. Hezekiah Usher.

Present, Mr. Gookin, Mr. Danforth, Capt. Lusher, Capt. Johnson, Mr. Joseph
Hill.


A copy of the writing of Mr. Norton presented by himself and Mr. Bradstreet as
their final propositions to us respecting their going or not going at this time
on the country's service.

WE whose names are subscribed, met together as a committee to attend the
business concerning the sending of Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton as messengers
from the general court into England, finding the state of times to be so
defective as to the answering the terms upon which the undertaking was on
their parts accepted as may minister unto them matter of just discouragement as
to their proceedings at present, and also it not being in our power to redress
the same upon consideration thereof together with their care to avoid offense,
especially in a matter of this importance, professed in such degree as that if
the committee shall yet declare it their judgment that they ought to go at
this time, they purpose notwithstanding, God willing, to proceed accordingly.

We say, in consideration hereof and some other respects not needful here to
be mentioned, we thought meet for the prevention of all grievances or
dissatisfaction and fuller deliverance of them from all sufferings in the minds
of any who either desired or expected their present going to attest the
premises.

The question being put, whether this paper pass as an act of the committee.

The committee on serious consideration hereof voted and concluded in the
negative.

By order, Edw. Rawson, Secr.

Having further considered the reasons presented by our honored friends Simon
Bradstreet, Esquire and the Rev. John Norton, gentlemen commissioners appointed for
our affairs with his Majesty, wherein they expressed themselves doubtful of
their way as to any further proceeding; we the committee empowered for that
matter do conceive that what is contained in our former answers given in
writing does declare the substance of what can be expected from us, yet
nevertheless that we be not wanting in the trust reposed in us by the honored
court, do propose to our honored friends, that whereas one part of their
objection lies in the matter of the address agreed upon by the court (for our
parts we understand by all debates in councils and courts that the maine end
of this undertaking is for the obtaining his protection and confirmation of our
liberties enjoyed by pattent and present establishment) we do therefore offer
to our honored friends as an expedient to issue this case, that they will
please to draw up our address to his Majesty as themselves think may best
conduce to the aforesaid ends, and we hope there shall be no failing on our
parts as to a meet encouragement and approbation thereof, to which purpose, as
we conceive, full power of the general court is delegated to us; or
otherwise, if the matter of labor be too great a burden to them at such a
time, then we desire they will be pleased briefly to give us in writing what
they judge convenient to be added or left out of the former addresses, and we
shall apply ourselves to give further satisfaction in the premises; and
further, we are ready in all we may or can to comply with what they shall
present, that so this great work of the Lord be not retarded, his servants
grieved, our honored friends in England offended, the Kings Majesty incensed,
our adversaries animated, and advantaged, our All so much hazarded, especially
our God dishonored and displeased, all which we earnestly desire and shall
endeavor may be prevented.

By order, Edw. Rawson, Secretary.

THE commit for raising moneys having reported what they had done, i. e.
raised about four hundred pounds, the committee ordered that Mr. William Davis,
or in case of his death or absence, Mr. Simon Bradstreet take up in London, or
elsewhere, of any gentlemen or merchants, what moneys shall be expedient, for
the use of the country, not exceeding the some of three hundred pounds; which
moneys are to be delivered into the hands of Mr. Simon Bradstreet and Mr. John
Norton, or either of them, to be disposed of by them for the end aforesaid, and
whatever contract the said Mr. William Davis or Mr. Bradstreet shall make in
the premises, either in point of exchange or advance, the said committee do,
in the name and by the power of the court, confirm and ratify; hereby
authorizing the said William Davis or Simon Bradstreet to charge bills upon the
treasurer of the country to pay the same according to agreement, who is also
hereby ordered and required to accept and pay the same, who is empowered to
issue forth warrants for such proportion of a rate upon the people as shall be
meet to sattisfy such payments.

Capt. Davis his return was,
Gentlemen, In reference to your motion for my acceptance of a letter of credit
for the taking up moneys as you shall appoint for the use of the country to be
paid to the honored Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton, I shall with all readiness
endeavor the same upon the best terms I can procure it, provided I may be
secured from any damage as for my own estate, in case any unexpected change
should come upon the country. I pray consider what may be most convenient for
my security, and whether the treasurers bond to myself will be sufficient, or
whether will he give me such a bond for my security, yea or no?

24 January 1661.
Present, Capt. Gookin, Mr. Danforth, Maj. Lusher, Capt. Johnson, Mr. Joseph
Hill.


At this meeting the committee determined and concluded upon the address to be
presented to his Majesty and the commissioners instructions, which are as
follows.

WHEREAS you Simon Bradstreet, Esquire and John Norton, Gentleman, are chosen and
authorized commissioners for this colony, to petition our Lord the King and to
endeavor the preservation and confirmation of our privileges formerly granted
and hitherto enjoyed; in pursuance whereof you are to attend the particulars
following.

1. You shall present us to his Majesty as his loyal and obedient subjects and
not be wanting to instance in the particulars which most and best render us so
to be.

2. You shall endeavor to take off all scandal and objections which are or
shall be made against us.

3. You shall endeavor the establishment of the rights and privileges we now
enjoy.

4. You shall not engage us by any act of yours to any thing which may be
prejudicial to our present standing, according to pattent.

5. You shall give us a speedy and constant account of all your transactions
and what else may be of concernment to us.

In the name and by the order of the general court of the Massachusetts

To the high and mighty Prince CHARLES the second, by the grace of God king of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, etc.
The humble Petition and Address of the General Court of the Colonie of the
Massachusetts in New England.
Most gracious and dread sovereign,
THE purport of this poor script is to supplicate the inclination of your
royal ear unto the persons herewith sent, Mr. Simon Bradstreet and Mr. John
Norton, after a journey of three thousand miles, prostrate at your highness
feet as messengers from your poor yet loyal subjects.

To implore your gracious confirmation of our pattent granted by your royal
predecessor of famous memory, that encouragement we have so support us in this
wilderness (touching our quiet enjoyment both of our civil and ecclesiastical
liberties) together with that further hope wherewith we are comforted by your
serene Majestys late propitious return to our humble address.

To beseech your Majestys grace and favor toward us in what our commissioners
shall humbly present as conducing to your Majestys just honor and our good.

Ready to give an account of what your Majesty shall require to be informed in,
touching this your plantation.

And also in particular to acquaint your most excellent Majesty, that in
observance of your Highness pleasure signified, requiring us to forbear the
executing of death or inflicting corporal punishment on the people called
Quakers we have suspended the execution of our laws in that respect; since
which, by reason of their practices and principles in conjunction with the
distemper of too many ill affected amongst us, (pardon us, Royal Sir, whilst
necessitated thereunto we crave leave to represent unto you that) we, besides
the present disturbance even to some degree of disaffection, do houerly
conflict with the fear of some sad events, calamitous, unsufferable, if not
destructive, until your royal Majesty shall be pleased to concede unto us the
security of ourselves by some most gentle and effectual remedy suitable to our
condition.

And now we humbly pray that these our messengers may, under the shadow of
your most gracious protection, have liberty to speak in our behalf, unto
which persons we most humbly desire your Majesty to give full credence as to
loyal and faithful men entrusted by the representatives of your people in
this place, who always shall as in duty they are bound continually pray for
your Majestys temporal and eternal happiness.

Your Majestys most loyal and humble subjects, Signed Jo. Endecott, Governor.
In the name and by the order of the general court of the Massachusetts
jurisdiction in New England.



At this time also the committee judged it meet to write to my Lord Say, and
several other letters, the copies whereof are.
Right Honorable,
THE long experience that your poor suppliants have had of your unfeigned love
to the Lord and to his poor people whenever his providence has given you an
opportunity for their relief, especially to these poor sheep of his in this
wilderness, does embolden us yet further to trouble your Lordship with these few
lines.

So great is the fury of the dragon, that when the woman is fled into the
wilderness yet he cease not to power out a flood after her, seeking to his
power her utter ruin. A taste whereof Gods poor people here do feel in the
violence and rage of these malicious adversaries the Quakers risen up against
us, accusing us to his Majesty and intruding themselves upon us, whose work it
is to disseminate their cursed principles and in a tumultuous and rude manner
reproaching all established order, as well civil as eccesiasticall, acting a
part as commissionated from hell to ruin the poor churches and people of God
here.

Although while we thus speak we cannot but acknowledge our God is holy and
righteous in all his dispensations toward us, our great unprofitablenes under
long enjoyment of his precious ordinances and liberties that we have been
here betrusted with, having justly provoked his anger against us; yet we must
say with his servant David, let us fall into the hands of the Lord whose
mercies are great, and not under the fury and malice of those heretics whose
tender mercies are cruelty.

For which end we have commissionated our trusty and well beloved friends Mr.
Simon Bradstreete and Mr. John Norton, to appear before his Majesty and his
most honorable council on the behalf of this colony, to give an account of
the condition of his Majestys poor yet loyal subjects in this place and the
ground of our proceedings against that wicked sect; as also humbly to implore
his Highness gracious favor for the confirmation of our present enjoyments by
letters pattent from his most royal predecessors, for whose furtherance, by
opening a door of access to his Majesty and the procuring of his favorable
acceptance of our endeavors, wherein we desire to act not only our own
interest but the interest of our Lord and our King, we stand in need of the
help of our honored friends on the place, and having none on whom we can
repose greater confidence than on your Lordship, we are therefore bold humbly
to crave your honors favor herein, as a motive hereto we need not be
further tedious to your honor by way of argument, being well assured that the
interest which our Lord Christ has in your Lordship is most effectual
thereto. Unto whose grace and in whose arms of everlasting mercies we commend
your honor in whom we are,

Right honorable, Your humble servants and suppliants, I. E. Gov. By order of
the general court of the Massachusetts.

For the Rt. Hon. Wm. Viscount Say and Seal, etc.
At a meeting of the Committee, Boston 24. 11. 1661.
Right Honorable,
THAT respect of yours extended to poor exiles (a condition your honor have
sometimes tasted) in the countenance showed to our humble petition and address
to his Majesty 1660, does beget in us a lively hope of your further clemency
in this our present errand, which is to supplicate your honor for favor to the
bearers hereof Mr. Simon Bradstreet and Mr. John Norton, sent on purpose as
messengers from this poor colony unto our lord the King, for obtaining his
grace and protection in the confirmation of our pattent and present
establishment, unto which his Majesty's gracious letter in answer to our
foresaid address does much encourage us, also to give an account to his
serene highness in what he shall please to require concerning the state of this
his plantation. We have appointed these our messengers to wait upon your
honor (according to your wonted beneficence) to cast your eye upon them and
us, in doing whereof we shall have cause to pray for, the rich blessing of
heaven and earth to descend upon you and yours. So we trust the God of all
grace and glory will not fail to accept and recompense all kindness extended to
this little part of his heritage, so we remain,

Right honorable Your honors most humble servants, Jo. Endecott, Gov. By order,
etc.

To the right hon. Edward Earl of Clarendon, lord high Chancellor of England
and one of his Majesty's most honorable privy council, these humbly present.
Right honorable,
THESE are principally to accompany our beloved friends Mr. Simon Bradstreet
and Mr. John Norton, the bearers hereof, who are sent on purpose from us as
messengers unto his Majesty to implore his favor and protection in the
confirmation of our patent and present establishment, and to give an account,
in what he shall require, of the state of this plantation, and to beseech him
to tender us in respect of those pestilent heretics the Quakers who have
lately obtained his Majesty's letter requiring us to forbear their
punishments; in observance whereof we have suspended execution of our laws
against them respecting death or corporal punishment; but this indulgence they
do abuse to insolency and seduction of our people, and unless his Majesty
strengthen our hands in the application of some suitable remedy to suppress
these and others ill affected to our tranquillity, this hopeful plantation is
likely in all probability to be destroyed, and how far that will conduce to
the King's honor or profitt we leave to your honors prudence to consider.
Therefore if it may please your honor to promote this errand of your humble
suppliants and vouchsafe your countenance to our messengers and procure favor
and access to his Majesty and his ministers of state, you will greatly oblige
your servants to bless God for you, and to pray that the blessing of heaven
and earth may rest upon yor head and heart in Christ Jesus in whom we are,

Right honorable, Your honors most humble servants, Jo. Endecott, Gov. By
order, etc.

SUCH is the necessity of our present occasions that we are again forced to
trouble you again, and have here enclosed according to your direction
particular receipts, which we pray you sign, that on the receipt of the money
they may be delivered to those gentlemen who are willing to pleasure the
country in this business, which we would entreat them to dispatch forthwith
back again by this messenger that the money may be received to night, for we
now lie on great demurrage. Sir, not else but that we are yours to serve in
what we may.

Daniel Gookin, Eleaz. Lusher, Tho. Danforth, Edw. Johnson, Joseph Hill.


Boston in New England 25th January 1661.
WE the Committee of the general court for accomplishment of the negotiation
of our messengers for England, by virtue of the authority of the general court
to us derived, do order that the treasurer of the country shall within one
week after the sailing of the messengers from Nantasket issue forth one full
half rate upon the inhabitants of this jurisdiction, payable in wheat, barley,
pease or money, to be brought in before the tenth of the 1st month next,
signifying that all such as shall pay in money to abate one fifth part.

By order, Edward Rawson, Secr.

Sir,
BEING confidently assured of your readiness to strengthen the hands of your
poor exile brethren, whose interest is one, although in their millitant
condition scattered here and there upon the face of the earth, and conflicting
with many adversaries, who like Sanballat and Tobiah of old, are troubled to
see temple work prosper, the which at present is eminently the condition of
God's poor people in this remote wilderness; by reason whereof the general
court of this colony of the Massachusetts, in observance of their duty to God
and his Majesty our sovereign lord the King, have commissioned our trusty and
beloved friends Simon Bradstreet, Esquire and the Rev. Mr. John Norton to appear
before his Majesty on our behalf, whose occasions for money we could not
certainly foresee, and by reason of our great distance know no better expedient
for their supply then by improoving our interest in sundry of our friends on
the place. These are therefore to request your favor that in case our said
commissioners or Mr. William Davis, our trusty and assured friend, shall
acquaint you that they have occasions for supply, that you will be pleased to
disburse to the sum of fifty pounds more or less, and for your security their
bill of exchange signed by any one of them, and charged on Mr. Richard Russell
treasurer of this colony, shall be effectual for the repayment thereof; and so
we remain,

Sir, Your affectionate friend and servant, Edward Rawson, Secr. In the name
and by order of the general court.

This was directed to the much honored Herbert Pelham, Esquire etc. The like was
directed to Maj. Heines, Mr. Robert Thompson, Mr. Nehemiah Bourne, Mr. Francis
Willoughby, Alderman Will. Peake, Mr. Richard Hutchinson, Mr. Thomas Bell, Mr.
Edm. White, Mr. Henry Ashurst.
At a meeting 28th January 1661. Honored Sir,
WHereas the general court has seen meet to empower us to dispatch their
messengers Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton for the negotiation with his Majesty,
all which is now prepared, we hope to their content, and themselves have
declared their readiness to attend that service, there remaining now nothing
wanting but your signing thereof. We understand by the secretary you have a
second time declined; now that we may not be found wanting in our duty, we
have again sent to your worship, desiring your final answer concerning the
perfecting thereof according to the trust reposed in you by the general court,
which if you shall yet refuse the whole business will be frustrated, and we
fear his Majesty greatly incensed, our enemies advantaged, our friends
discouraged, the chief power of this colony disappointed, many of its eminent
servants grieved, and above all our God dishonored, which we pray may be
avoided. So we rest your friends and servants.

Signed, Daniell Gookin, Eliazer Lusher, Thomas Danforth, Joseph Hill.

Sir, We crave your answer by the gentlemen whom we have entreated to be the
bearers hereof, that no unnecessary charge may accrue to the country by a
further demurrage of the ship.



This letter was sent to the Governor by Mr. Edw. Tyng and Capt. Tho. Savage,
who returned the answer that the secretary should come to the Governor on the
morrow morning about 8 of the clock and he would sign all as is desired. Which
was done accordingly.
Boston 29th January 1661. To the honored Committee,
HAVING upon the first communicating the business of our message to England by
the honored committee, formerly discerned such unexpected discouragements as
that we took ourselves in point of faithfullness to all parties concerned in
so weighty a service to represent the same by writing to yourselves, after
which, waiting with much patience if our way might be cleared notwithstanding,
and now finding in conclusion the ship being ready to sail (besides some other
discouragements not to be neglected) an uncertainty as to the convenient supply
of money in England, apprehended requisite for the carrying on of this
negotiation, we crave leave by these to present the premises put together, as
a reason upon the whole circumstancing this business to the present, with such
inconveniences and hazards in respect of the event thereof, as it seems unto
us less consisting with christian prudence to proceed therein at this time.

Simon Bradstreet, John Norton.


The committee having considered the writing presented them by Mr. Bradstreet
and Mr. Norton dated 29. 11. 1661, return as follows. That they are ready to
attend any propositions that may be made by our honored commissioners for their
furtherance, according to the power put into their hands by the general court,
and further they have not to reply, leaving the issue with all future
consequences to the allwise disposing hand of God in Christ Jesus.

Daniel Gookin, Eliazer Lusher, Thomas Danforth, Edw. Johnson, Joseph Hill.

To the end the proceeding of the messengers for England be not retarded or
frustrate by any defect of ours, we by the authority of the general court to
us derived, do order that such advance for the money raised by the committee
for that design as shall by the said committee or the secretary be engaged
for, shall be repaid by the treasurer, together with the several sums
payable, according to agreement.

Daniel Gookin, Eliazer Lusher, Thomas Danforth, Edw. Johnson, Joseph Hill.




Upon which order the secretary, by advice of Capt. Savage, agreed and signed
accordingly, that all such as paid English money, or money in England, should
have twenty five percent allowed them.

The committee going home, hoping on the first fair wind to find and hear
the honored messengers to be sailed away, the Lord was pleased to visit the
Rev. Mr. Norton, being the second of February, with a violent fit of sickness
and much cold, that he was forced to keep his bed. On the third day the
committee for raising money signified, by letter to the magistrates at
Cambridge, the frown of God in all endeavors and desired their present
council whether to stay the ship for a season, according to former resolution,
to see what the Lord would do in respect of Mr. Norton etc. or to suffer her
to pass; advice was returned to issue out warrant for the stay of said ship,
which was done.

4th February 1661. To the master of the ship Society.
THESE are to require you, by virtue of the authority of the general court and
on their occasions to make stay of your ship for these five days next coming
and not depart the harbor, for which the owners may expect necessary and due
demurrage. Dated at Boston this 4th of February 1661.

Per order, Edward Rawson, Secretary.

At a meeting 6th February 1661. Mr. Secretary,
THE master of the ship having manifested himself that any further delay will
be greatly prejudicial to the owners, etc. our advise is, that in case the
gentlemen appointed for the negotiation with his Majesty do not manifest,
under their hands, that a further delay may have a tendency to the furtherance
of the ends proposed by the general court, that then you release the ship from
her present stoppage.

Signed by Daniel Gookin, Thomas Danforth, Edw. Johnson, Joseph Hill.


7th February 1661. This directed to the Rev. Mr. John Norton. Reverend Sir,
THE master of the ship intended for England has been with us, since lecture,
desireing liberty to depart, unto whom we have no other answer to give, but
only to referr him to yourselves, on whose account, according to the trust
reposed in us by the general court, she was stayed, and in case you shall
please to advise us that a further stoppage may be a tendency to the ends
proposed we shall concur therein; if otherwise, we are unwilling to force
any unnecessary inconvenience on those especially concerned in such delay.

Sir, Mr. Bradstreet being present with us manifests himself ready to attend
the service of the country, in case the providence of God give liberty to
yourself.

Signed, Dan Gookin, Edw. Johnson, Tho. Danforth, Joseph Hill.

7. 12. 1661.
Mr. Norton returned that his answer is as at the first, he is ready to attend
advise.

Mr. Secretary,
WHEREAS Mr. Norton has signified to us that the resolution of his proceeding
in his voyage for England does as yet solely depend on God, our advise is
therefore that you forthwith release the ship from her present stoppage, and
that in case the gentlemen do not proceed in their voyage, that you then
require from aboard such provisions as have binn put aboard for their
accommodation, excepting only what you shall see meet to gratify the seamen
withal, and also we do advise that, in case of their non going, the bills of
exchange be returned to the respective subscribers, and the treasurers bills
taken in, that so the country may not be put to further unnecessary damages.

7. 12 mo. 1661. Jo. Endecott, Gov. Tho. Danforth, Eliaz. Lusher, Ed. Johnson,
Jos. Hill.


Warrant issued accordingly for the ships dismission.
To Mr. Christopher Clarke, master of the ship Society.
WHEREAS by authority of the general court said ship was made stay of, on
their occasions, for five days for which the owners might expect due and
necessary demurrage: These are, by advise from the like authority, to declare
that the said ship is hereby discharged from her former stoppage.

Dated at Boston, 7th Feb. 1661. Per order, Edw. Rawson, Secretary.

For the honored committee.
THAT a further delay may have a tendency to the furtherance of the ends
proposed by the honored general court I think cannot be denied* but whether it
will be effectual unto that end or not, seems to be the question, and that
such an one whose resolution, as to the certainty thereof, depends solely upon
God. To attend his providence in the use of means belongs unto man, and in the
present case to yourselves belongs (at least in a principal manner) the active
part, to the commissioners the passive only, wherein as has been formerly, by
both, so you have hereby again attested, by the subscriber, all readiness to
resign up ourselves to the call of God herein, any difficulties
notwithstanding, on our parts.

6. 12 mo. 1661. John Norton.

To which the committee replied.
Sir,
ON perusal of yours, wherein you are pleased to intimate as though something
did yet remain for the committee to be active in, these are only to signify to
you, that in case you shall please to advise us wherein we may further
contribute to your furtherance, we are ready to attend your advise. Sir, with
prayers to the Lord for guidance in a right path, we remain,

Sir, Yours wherein we may serve you, Thomas Danforth, Joseph Hill, Edw.
Johnson, Eliaz. Lusher.

Boston 7. 12 mo. 1661.
I Eliazer Lusher being by the committee sent to the reverend Mr. Norton, with
a paper drawn in reference to a former paper sent from him to us the committee
aforesaid, to understand from him whether he judged there was yet any thing
remaining for us further to do or to be active in, necessary to the promoting
the negotiation intended: His answer to me was, that he knew not of any thing
either forgotten, neglected or yet further to be attended by us the committee,
in reference to the case aforesaid, or to that effect.

Per me Eliazer Lusher.

Mr. Secretary,
SIR, As to the disposal of the provisions provided at the countries charge for
the accommodation of our messengers in the ship Society, our advise is, that in
case they do not go, that then you dispose of the same in manner following,
i. e. that you leave with the seamen and master the strong liquors, be it more
or less, the provisions undressed with the wine and bedding that you dispose
of it for the countries benefitt, and the other provisions we conceive it is
meet that you leave the same with the gentlemen for whom it was provided to
dispose thereof at their pleasure.

Thomas Danforth, Joseph Hill, Edw. Johnson, Eliaazer Lusher.

7. 12 mo. 1661.
The committee having took their leaves of the commissioners, it being very
doubtful and uncertain whether Mr. Norton would be so well as to adventure to
go, though such a forwardnes appeared as the provisions for their voyage, in a
great measure, was sent on board, and a little before the committee went to
their homes, sent for again, which occasioned the committee to take care to
dispose thereof, and also to draw up certain letters to the persons of honor
formerly mentioned, with letters to Col. Temple and Col. Croune, in case of not
going, to give his Majesty a sattisfactory account that the only reason thereof
was that the Lord, whose we are and in whose hands our times are, by his all
wise disposition in such a juncture, had determined it so to be, to whose will
we all owe obedience and submission; and though the provisions came on shore,
which was only housed with a secret hope of Gods merciful ordering and
disposing of such a turn as for which we should not only rejoice but be
thankful, the letters being writ and sealed; though afterward, on the second
day early in the morning, the Lord so encouraged and strengthened the heart of
the reverend Mr. Norton, that he expressed himself willing and resolved to go
that day, being the 11th of February; which on notice of, the secretary
delivered the commission, instructions and all writings that concerned the
negotiation, to the honored Mr. Bradstreet, and made with Capt. Savage and Mr.
Usher such further provisions as was wanting and the time would permit, an
account whereof and of the disposing of the money is ready to be shown to the
honored general court, with all humble desire of a favorable acceptance of the
committees endeavors, which will oblige them to be studious further to serve
the country as they are able.

Per order, Edw. Rawson, Secretary.

Copy of a Letter from the Committee of the General Court to Mr. Richard
Saltonstall, etc. This and the next Letter were prepared to be forwarded in
case the Agents should not proceed.

Gentlemen and our very loveing friends,
THE experience that we have had of your former labor of love and faithfulness
to your remote friends, does encourage and emboulden yet further to crave your
favor, although accompanied with some labor on your part, as to the
accomplishing of this our request.

Such is the all-wise providence of God toward us, that after no little
travel for the attaineing of meet persons from among ourselves, for our
messengers, to appear before his Majesty and most honorable council on the
behalf of this colony, together with provision according to our poor ability
for such a dispatch, it has pleased the Lord to frustrate our design by
disinabling one of our said messengers by sickness, even then when there
remained nothing but their going aboard, whereupon the ship has been put upon
demurrage, even to the hazard both of ship and cargo, by reason of the ice in
this cold country, so that we are now forced to send away the address to his
Majesty with letters to some lords of his honorable council without our
messengers accompanying the same, we being wholly incapable to empower any
other, not having an opportunity to convene our general court for the
commissioning of some other in his stead.

Our request is therefore to yourselves, jointly or severally, as God may give
you opportunity, after the perusal of the enclosed to seal up the same, and
then improve your interest in your and our friends for the delivering of our
petition to his Majesty, together with a true representation of this our
present disappointment of our real intention, as also for the deliverie of our
letters to the several lords, craving their favor according to the purport
thereof, of whose favorable acceptance we shall be glad to hear by the first
opportunity.

As also our request is to yourselves that you be pleased to further our
request to his Majesty, being to us a matter of great importance, and wherein,
as we conceive, the glory of our God is not a little concerned.

What moneys you expend on this our business charge it to our account, and we
shall readily and thankfully own the same; and we are confidently persuaded he
whose name and glory is so greatly interested in our quarrel with those cursed
heretics, will also own your labor and travel herein, their malice being
not so much against our persons and estates, as against his truth and
ordinances, under which we have here desired to shroud ourselves. Unto whose
guidance and blessing we committ you and yours, and remain,

Gentlemen, Your assured friends and brethren in Christ Jesus.

For Mr. Rich. Saltonstall, Mr. Hen. Ashurst, Mr. John Leverett, or any of them.
7th February 1661.
Copy of a Letter from the Committee of the General Court to Col. Thomas Temple.
Sir,
THE experience we have had of your cordial affection to his Majesty's poor
subjects, circumstanced with the distance and means of so remote a wilderness
condition, does embolden to the troubling your honor with these lines.

Such is the good pleasure of him who rules all things according to his own
will, that when with no little travel and difficulty we had attained two meet
persons from amongst ourselves for our messengers to our lord the King, with
some provisions for such an undertaking, according to our poor ability, it
has pleased the Lord to frustrate all our endeavors by his visitation of one
of them (i.e.) the Rev. Mr. John Norton, whereby he is disinabled to attend
that service; the which, as to ourselves, the disappointment is great, and we
cannot but look upon it as an humbling and awful providence, and that the
rather, in that our adversaries thereby have occasion given them to triumph,
and to boast themselves that the Lord fights against us.

Sir, Your self being not long since on the place, we need not to trouble you
with an account of our condition as now circumstanced with the malignancy of
our adversaries, especially bent against the interest of the Lord and his poor
people here, as yourself do well know, who while they plead with that wicked
Haman, that our laws are diverse from all people, and do accuse us of
disobedience to the laws of our king, and that it is not for his Majesty's
profit to suffer us, pretending great profit to his Majesty in case their
enterprises may be achieved, although we may truly say the enemy in so doing
could not countervayle the king's damage.

Our request to your self is, that according to the opportunity God has put
into your hands, you will be pleased to further those gentlemen to whom we
have committed the trouble of accompanying our address to his Majesty together
with your presence countenancing of the same, if you shall see meet, and to be
futher isntrumental, wherein you truly may, for the removing of any offense
that this our disappointment may occasion; assuring his Majesty (as we hope
you have charity toward us) that, however we are loaded with the calumnies of
our adversaries, we shall always approve ourselves to be those that fear the
Lord and honor our King.

Sir, We have not to persuade hereto with motives of our own deserts or with
future obligations. You well knowing our condition, how circumstanced, with so
great distance and meaness, utterly incapacitating to a suitable return of
your favor; yet we hope you will not find us uncivil in not acknowledging the
same. And however it fares with us, you may assure yourselfe that he who
keeps a register of all hearts and thoughts, Mal. 3.16 yea even of a cup of
cold water, will not be unmindfull of your labor of love, into whose arms of
mercy and blessing in Christ Jesus committing you and all your weighty
affairs, we remain

Yours in wherein we may to serve you, J. E. etc.

For Col. Tho. Temple.
Copy of a Letter from the Corporation in England to the Commissioners of the
united Colonies.
Honored Gentlemen,
A Letter of yours being brought hither, directed to Mr. Ashurst and Mr.
Hutchinson, though the former of these two gentlemen did by the last ship, as
he tells us, acknowledge the receipt of it, and intimate the reasons of our
silence, yet we now think it meet to assure you also ourselves how acceptable
it was to us to be informed, partly by that letter of yours and partly by the
relation of some learned ministers that came a while since from New England,
that you continue your care and concern for the propagation of the gospel of
Christ amongst the poor Indians, and we are glad that through the goodness of
God we are now in a condition to inform you that since the receipt of your
lately mentioned letter, it has pleased the king's majesty (in council) to
grant a charter of incorporation, wherein many of the nobility and other
persons of quality, and most of those gentlemen that were formerly employed in
the like work are authorized and appointed to endeavor the carrying on of
that pious design (for converting the heathen natives) wherein they deservedly
esteem it both an honor and advantage to be employed in this new
establishment, being among other particulars enjoined to appointe commissioners
in New England to prosecute there by our directions his Majesty's pious
intentions; we judge this to be a matter of the highest concernment that
belongs to the work entrusted to us, for all our endeavors here and all the
supplies we may procure from hence, will be but ineffectuall, though not to
our own souls, yet to the work we would promote, unless there be a prudent
and faithful management of what we send over, by the commissioners we shall
appoint in New England, and those that they shall employ, and therefore since,
having obtained the best information we can and seriously considered the
matter, we have pitched on the same course that have been formerly taken in
pursuance of the same ends and care, and accordingly determined at present to
desire you to take upon you again the care and management of this work upon
the place, we hope you will descerne how great a trust we willingly repose in
you, and we doubt not of your readiness to comply (as formerly you have done)
with our directions herein. The business wherein we desire to engage you being
such as we think it truly honorable to be engaged in ourselves, and the
design being of a nature to which the greatest and most precious promises are
annexed, besides that the civilizing and converting of your barbarous and
unbelieving neighbors is that whose success will be in some regards of more
immediate advantage to your selves than to us, our good wishes to so christian
a work makes it much our troble to see that the means of carrying it on are
no greater then we now at our entrance find them, which we mention, not by
way of reflection on those to whose hands the management of them was committed
before the grant of the charter, but because it is necessary for us to
acquainte you with the condition we are brought to, partly by the great charge
you and we have been at on several necessary occasions, and partly (and
indeed chiefly) by the injurious dealing of some who take advantage of the
letter of the law, against all justice and equity, to repossesse themselves of
what they formerly sold, whereby the greatest part of our revenue is at present
detained, which will prove, we fear, very expensive and somewhat difficult to
recover, and therefore we desire as little money may be drawn on us for this
year to come as will possibly consist with the not neglecting of what is
necessary to be done, we say for this next year because we cannot be so
dispondent as not to hope that the providence of God will, by some means or
other, provide for the supply of a work so much tending to his own glory, and
so acceptable to those that are so heartily concerned for it. The bill of L.800
drawn for the use of the Indian work is for the most part paid, and should
have been entirely so ere now, were it not for the want of present money. That
which is from time to time laid out we desire may, according to your
commendable practice, be sent us over in a particular within the year, and it
may assist us in the regulating our expenses, if you be pleased to let us know,
by the first convenience, what further charge you judge you shall be putt to by
perfecting the printing of the bible; the use of that divine book and also a
constant use of catechizing, we judge most necessary for the Indians
instruction in religion; and we also think it may conduce to unity and order
if the same catechism be generally taught amongst them. If our stock do
increase, which we hope it hereafter may, especially since his Majesty
himself has been graciously pleased particularly to countenance this work,
and to secure both what has been, and what may be given toward it, by a
legal settlement, which before was wanting; if (we say) our means increase
we should consider of some employment in the way of trade and manufacture to
employ the Indians, or if in the interim there occurrs to you any thing about
this or any other matter that you judge may tend to the promoting of that good
work, wherein we have the happiness to be jointly engaged, your information and
advice will be, as well as your assistance, very welcome to us.

Signed in the name and by the appointment of the corporation for the
propagation of the gospel in America. Per Robert Boil, Gov.
London 15th May 1662. For the worshipful the Commissioners of the united
colonies of New England, in New England, these.



Copy of a Letter from King Charles the second to the Massachusetts.
CHARLES REX.

TRUSTY and well beloved, We greet you well. Whereas we have lately received
an humble address and petition from the general court of our colony of the
Massachusetts in New England, presented to us by Simon Bradstreet and John
Norton, We have thought it agreeable to our princely grace and justice to let
you know that the same have been very acceptable unto us, and that we are
satisfied with your expressions of loyalty, duty and good affection made to us
in the said address, which we doubt not proceeds from the hearts of our good
subjects, and We are therefore willing that all our good subjects of that
plantation do know that We do receive them into our gracious protection, and
will cherish them with our best encouragement, and that We will preserve, and
do hereby confirm the pattent and charter heretofore granted to them by our
royal father of blessed memory, and that they shall freely enjoy all the
privileges and libertyes granted to them in and by the same, and that We
will be ready to renew the same charter to them, under our great seal of
England, whenever they shall desire it. And because the license of these late
ill times have likewise had an influence upon our colony, in which they have
swerved from the rules prescribed, and even from the government instituted by
the charter, which we do graciously impure rather to the iniquity of the time
than to the evil intents of the hearts of those who exercised the government
there. And We do therefore publish and declare our free and gracious pardon
to all our subjects of that our plantation, for all crimes and offenses
committed against us during the late troubles, except any such persons who
stand attaynted by our parliament here of high treason, if any such persons
have transported themselves into those parts; the apprehending of whom and
delivering them into the hands of justice We expect from the dutiful and
affectionate obedience of those our good subjects in that colony, if they be
found within the jurisdiction and limmitts thereof. Provided always, and be it
in our declared expectation, that upon a review of all such laws and
ordinances that are now or have been during these late troubles in practice
there, and which are contrary or derogative to our authority and government,
the same may be annulled and repealed, and the rules and prescriptions of the
said charter for administering and taking the oath of allegiance be henceforth
duly observed, and that the administration of justice be in our name. These are
made the conditions of the Pardon which the King may annex as he thinks fit, on
the performance whereof the validity of the Pardon will depend. What follows
seems to be rather a requisition or recommendation of certain acts upon the
performance whereof depends his Majesty's further grace and favor. This is
called a Letter and certainly was not a Pardon under the great seal. It is
however often claimed as a Grant or Charter as well for the remission of all
Offenses as for the confirmation of all Liberties and Privileges granted by
Patent.
And since the principle and foundation of that charter was and is the freedom
of liberty of conscience, We do hereby charge and require you that that
freedom and liberty be duly admitted and allowed, so that they that desire to
use the book of common prayer and perform their devotion in that manner that
is established here be not denied the exercise thereof, or undergo any
prejudice or disadvantage thereby, they using their liberty peaceably without
any disturbance to others; and that all persons of good and honest lives and
conversations be admitted to the sacrament of the Lords supper, according to
the said book of common prayer, and their children to baptism. We cannot be
understood hereby to direct or wish that any indulgence should be granted to
those persons commonly called Quakers, whose principles being inconsistent with
any kind of government, We have found it necessary, with the advice of our
parliament here, to make a sharp law against them, and are well content you do
the like there. Although We have hereby declared our expectation to be that
the charter granted by our royal father, and now confirmed by us, shall be
particularly observed, yet, if the number of assistants enjoined thereby be
found by experience, and be judged by the country, to be inexpedient, as We
are informed it is, We then dispense with the same, and declare our will and
pleasure, for the future, to be, that the number of the said assistants shall
not exceed 18, nor be less at any time than 10, We assuring ourselves, and
obliging and commanding all persons concerned that, in the election of the
governor or assistants, there be only consideration of the wisdom and
integrity of the persons to be chosen, and not of any faction with reference to
their opinion or profession, and that all the freeholders of competent estates,
not vicious in conversations, orthodox in religion (though of different
persuasions concerning church government) may have their vote in the election
of all officers civil or military. Lastly, our will and pleasure is that at
the next general court of that our colony this our letter and declaration be
communicated and published, that all our loving subjects may know our grace and
favor to them, and that We do take them into our protection as our loving
and dutiful subjects, and that We will be ready from time to time to receive
any application or address from them, which may concern their interest and the
good of our colony, and that We will advance the benefit of the trade thereof
by our uttermost endeavor and countenance, presuming that they will still
meritt the same by their duty and obedience.

Given at Hampton Court, June 28th, in the fourteenth year of our reign. By his
Majesty's command, Ed. Nicholas.

Copy of the Petition of John Scott, Esquire to the King, about Long Island, in N.
York Government, with his Majesty's Reference thereof.
To the Kings most excellent Majesty, The humble petition of John Scott, Esquire
Shows,
THAT your Majesty's petitioner's father in the year 1641 sold 2200 l. per
ann. and advanced 14300 l. to the use of your Majesty's royal father of ever
blessed memory, besides the loss of his life in the said servis, and your
petitioner for a small expression of his loyalty, by cutting the bridles and
girts of some of the then parliaments horses quartering at Turnham Green and
his late Majesty's at Branford, was after many hearings before a committee of
the said parliament (by a gift of 500 l. to the said committee to prevent
further mischief) ordered to be sent to New England under the tuition of one
Downing, who dealt most perfidiously with your Majesty's petitioner; that your
Majesty's petitioner was forced to court any employment to acquire a
livelihood, employing himself in and about an island called Long Island, of
which island, before your Majesty's happy restoration, the petitioner
purchased near one third part.

The petitioner therefore humbly prays your Majesty of your princely grace
and favor to bestow upon him the government of the said island and islands
adjacent, or liberty to the inhabitants to choose a governor and assistants
yearly.

And the petitioner shall ever pray.

At the court at White Hall, June 26th 1663.
HIS Majesty having received good testimony of the petitioners loyalty and
great sufferings, and being fully satisfied of his particular abilities to
serve him, is most graciously inclined to encourage him in his desires, and is
pleased accordingly to refer his present suit to the committee of foreign
plantations, who are to consider and sertify I observe, in general, in these
Papers the orthography of the originals. This is printed from an original
signed by Sir Henry Bennet, afterward Earl of Arlington.
his Majesty whether there be any private pretensions upon the said island,
etc. (by any formar grant) that his Majesty may know what is proper to be done
for gratifying the petitioner and the good of his own subjects in those parts.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Leverett to Sir Thomas Temple in London, giving
an Account of the Massachusetts public Affairs.
THE state of this country as to its constitution and settlement under the
favor of his Majesty's pattents, and that these governments according to their
constitution thereby, have been carried an end some longer some shorter time,
is well known. That of Plymouth was the first settlement, but that of the
Massachusetts though begun diverse years after, yet by God's special blessing
is the most prosperose and considerable both for people and trade. For the
manner of government though it is under an annual election according to
pattent, yet the persons seldom changed or removed but by death or their own
removing out of the collony. The present state of the collonies through Gods
great mercy is a state of peace and under the enjoyment of a competency for the
continuance whereof we have dependence upon the continuance of that mercy of
God and his Majesty's graciose favor, for whose happiness and prosperity daily
prayers are made to the great God (the God of all grace and mercy) both in
public and private.

This summer we have been under some trouble by the pagan natives, who have
had their plottings and contrivances for our disquiet, but the Lord has
prevented it, blessed be his name, and there is a better understanding now
between the English and them than there was in the spring of the year. Some
small disturbance there has been at a place called Packatuck, between
Conecticott and Rhoad Island; the question between them is in point of
jurisdiction, and its credibly reported that Rhoad Island have chosen one Mr.
John Clarke I suppose this to be the same Person who was sentenced to be fined
or whipped for his antipaedobaptistical tenets, and who afterward removed to
Rhode Island where his posterity remain in repute to this day. See p. 309.
their deputy governor, and intend to send him to complain to his Majesty of
Conecticott. Conecticott have offered to referr the matter to the two colonies
of Massachusetts and Plymouth, to which motion diverse of Rhoad Island would
concur but others refuse, upon what ground is not understood. These colonies
not being interested in the quarrel or reason of it (though some of the
inhabitants may be in the land, or claim an interest therein, but the
government do not) so that that course might have been neighbourly to have
tried for an issue that way, before there had been giving a trouble to his
Majesty in so small a matter as it is supposed that will prove to be when
heard; however, it is a certain truth that the collony of the Massachusetts is
not at all engaged and not so much as acquainted with it further then report.
If so be that from the complaints of Rhoad Island men, or any others, any
thing should be reflected upon the collony of the Massachusetts, may we by the
means of any friend or friends but obtain the favor to be heard before we
are concluded with those complained against, or have any conclusion made of us,
it will be a verry high obligation unto us. Another thing desirable is, that
we may be advized what motions there may be concerning us, if any, whether for
our advantage or disadvantage. It Is well known that many have been the
attempts to give us disquiet or interruption in the work the Lord has set us
about in this wilderness, and we cannot think that we are yet without
ill-wishers. But God that has prevented and disapoynted all hitherto, can and
will, so far as it may concur with his own councills and good pleasure, which
has appeared to be councills of much peace toward an unworthy people, for
which let his holy name be forever praised by us in a way of believing, that
we may be able to say in truth, this God is our God who was our fathers and
will be our guide unto death.

Copy of a Letter from Sir John Wolstenholme to Mr. Edward Rawson, Secretary to
the New England Plantations.
Mr. Rawson,
I Have received the 26th of January your letter dated the 22d December, with
eleven copies of bonds and a copy of an order of your court in pursuance of
the act of navigation, with a letter from your governor about the same, and
testifying the receipt of his Majesty and counsels order and articles
concerning the said navigation, and am very glad to see your governor and
council of New England so ready to observe those good laws tending so much to
advance his Majestys service and the true English interest, wherein I conceave
the English plantations are as much concerned, if wayed with judgment and
discretion, as ourselves here; for if we do not maintain here the honor and
reputation of his Majesty and the nation, which must be by our navigation and
shipping which are our walls, the plantations will be subject to be devoured
by straingers. I am a great well wisher and good friend to your plantation and
so was my father before me who died 24 years since, because we did observe
your plantation industrious, and when some clouds were then here, about your
plantation, with our best advice to those sent from thence heather endeavored
to remove and disperse them, and although different in opinion in the
discipline of the church yet earnestlye desired to preserve and keep you
faithful to his Majestys crown and subjection as true Englishmen to the
civil government, which I hope will so continue, for which I shall always
pray, and with my humble service to your Governor I shall remain,

Your very loving friend, Jo. Wolstenholme.
London 1st of Feb. 1663. Since writing hereof I have received a second letter
with entire coppies of the aforesaid bonds from you by another shipe.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Thomas Prence Governor of Plymouth Colony, to
Secretary Rawson.
Sir,
I Have on the recept of yours by Capt. Olliver, and as the shortness of time
would admit advised with some of our inhabitants here; and taking notise of
Mr. Leet's also, we apprehend he does not groundlesly press the interposition
of the colonys in reference to Capt. Scott, This Capt. Scott, either under
color of the order of his Majesty in Council, p. 381, or some further
proceedings in consequence of it, came to Long Island and laid claim to the
property or jurisdiction or both, which gave great offense to New Haven colony
which had exercised jurisdiction over the East end of the Island. Scott was
taken and imprisoned as appears by Colonel Goffe's journal, but the whole
Island being soon after included in the grant to the Duke of York the
controversy between New Haven and Scott was settled.
it being a case wherein the whole may be deeply concerned, and therefore shall
endeavor the next week to dispatch away some that may be assistant to the
gentlemen that you have already sent. We hope they will be there in good time.
We see not how we can answer Mr. Leet's desire in a meeting of the
commissioners at Hartford, but do deeply resent the matter, and are very ready
to put forth to the uttermost in such an interposition, which with my respects
I entreat you to signify unto your honored council, so not willing to give
you noe further trouble, remain your assured friend and confederate,

Tho. Prence.

Copy of a Letter from King Charles the II. to the Inhabitants of the Province
of Maine.
To our trusty and well beloved the Inhabitants upon the Province of Meyn in
New England, or whom else it may concern.
CHARLES, R.

TRusty and well beloved we greet you well; whereas our trusty and well beloved
Ferdinando Gorges, Esquire has by his humble petition informed us that his
grandfather Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Knight, deceased, being a person who laid
himself forth very much for the advancing of foreign plantations, and
particularly that of New England in America, did in the fifteenth year of the
reign of our late royal father of blessed memory, obtain a grant under the
great seal of England, for a certain part and portion of the said country,
which by the said patent was entitled the province of Meyne and (as the
petitioner affirms, he has heard from several persons of worth) he the said
Sir Firdinando Gorges did expend in planting several parts of New England above
twenty thousand pounds sterling; and when he was in hopes to receive some
advantage in recompense of his great disbursements aforementioned, the late
unhappy wars breaking out in England, he the said Ferdinando Gorges (though
betwixt three and fourscore years of age) did personally engage in our royal
fathers service, and particularly in the siege of Bristol, by reason whereof
when it was necessary for him to appear before the council and committees for
foreign plantations, he was wholly discountenanced by them, even to the
encouraging of the people in the said province to disown his government, which
had continued for several years uninterrupted, and a party of the inhabitants
of the said province, petitioning the governors of the Massachusetts Bay, that
they would also take upon them the government of the said province; in
pursuance of that petition, those who had the government of the said Bay did
from thenceforth take upon them the government of the said province, so as both
the said Sir Ferdinando, the petitioners father, and himself, have ever since
been thereby deprived of the issues and profits of said province. Now in regard
of the premises, and for as much as those agents who were lately employed to
address themselves unto us, on the behalf of the governors and inhabitants of
the said Bay, being on the behalf of the petitioner charged before our privy
council for usurping the government of the said province, did declare that
those whom they represented did not claim any title in, or interest to the said
province; but did only govern the same until orders from hence were sent over
for the government thereof, on the behalf of the petitioner: upon whose humble
supplications, we were graciously pleased to refer the allegations aforesaid to
the consideration of our counsel learned in the law, who have made report unto
us, that they have considered thereof, and do find that Sir Ferdinando Gorges
aforementioned, in the fifteenth year of the reign of our royal father,
obtained a grant to him and his heirs under the great seal of England of a part
of New England in America, called by the name of the province of Meyne, to be
held as of the manor of East Greenwich, under certain rents and conditions in
the letters pattents expressed, and that it appeared by several affidavits and
certificates of credible persons that the said Sir Ferdinando Gorges had the
possession of the said province without any disturbance, and did govern the
same according to the directions of the said letters pattent for some years,
expended above twenty thousand pounds in the plantation thereof, that when he
had made such progress in the said plantation as that he expected to reap some
profit and advantage thereby, the unhappy wars breaking out in England Sir
Ferdinando Gorges was in actual service in the said wars for our royal
father, by reason whereof he was a great sufferer, plundered and imprisoned
several times and thereby disabled from any further expenses in carrying on the
said plantation, the rather for that he was so discouraged and discountenanced
by the then pretended commissioners for foreign plantations, as that his
commissioners were forced to come from the said plantation, and so lost the
possession, and the inhabitants thereof petitioned the governors of the
Massachusetts or Bay of Boston, to take them under their government, which
accordingly they did, and have continued under their government ever since, and
the petitioners commissioners since our restoration have endeavored to take
possession of the said province for the petitioner (being heir to his
grandfather) and proclaimed us, began to hold courts as formerly, and to
administer the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, but were disturbed and
hindered therein by the said governors of the Massachusetts or the Bay of
Boston, who required the commissioners to proceed no further on the behalf of
the petitioner until they had order from the supreme authority of England,
until which time they commanded the inhabitants of that province to continue
under their government: We have taken the whole matter into our princely
consideration, and finding the petitioners allegations and report of our said
council learned so consonant, we have thought fit to signify our pleasure on
the behalf of the said Ferdinando Gorges the petitioner, hereby requiring you
that you forthwith make restitution of the said province unto him or his
commissioners, and deliver him or them the quiet and peaceable possession
thereof: otherwise that without delay you show us reason to the contrary. And
so we bid you farewell. Given at our court at White Hall the 11th day of June
1664, in the 16th year of our reign.

By his Majesty's command. W. Morice.

Copy of a Letter from the General Court to Robert Boil, Esquire
Honorable Sir,
THE occasion of our giving you this trouble is from the confidence we have of
your favor and care of these his Majesty's collonies in New England,
manifested by your continued endeavors as in promoting that good work of the
natives conversion, so in taking opportunities for ingratiating us with his
Majesty and the right honorable the Lord Chancellor, as we understand by your
letter to Mr. Winthrop, wherein you have given us that comfortable information
of his Majesty's grace toward us in expressing himself in a very favorable
manner, and that the Chancellor did assure you (with giving you commission to
assure our friends in the city) that the King intends not any injury to our
charter or the destruction of our civil government, or the infringement of our
liberty of conscience, and that the doing of those things is none of the
business of the commissioners. The truth of which we believe as we ought to
do the words of so gracious a King.

But alas, Sir, The commission impowering those commissioners to hear and
determine all cases whatever, military, criminal or civil (what they have
further by instruction at present we know not) should it take place, what
would become of our civil government which has binn, under God, the head of
that liberty for our consciences for which the first adventurers passed
thorough and bore all difficulties and discouragements that encountered them as
in the way toe so in their continuance in this wilderness? Sir, We return you
our true and hearty thanks for your former favors and crave the continuance
thereof as opportunity shall offer and the great mover of hearts shall inclyne
you in appearing our friend still, that if possible the commission may be
recalled; for which end we have made our humble supplication to his Majesty,
in whose eyes may we find favor, we and our posterity shall have cause to
bless the Lord. But if the decree be past so that it cannot be recalled, we
shall weight the Lords issue with us; and whatever may be the conjectures of
any, rendering alterations here advisable, the issue will speak them to be
the subversion of all that which makes this place or our abode therein
desirable. Or if the envy of those that desire a dominion over us (not to
serve his Majesty's interest in advancing plantation work with the countenance
of godliness, but to serve themselves by his Majesty's authority and our ruin)
shall prevail, it will to posterity be rendered a disservice, to his Majesty's
dishonor, and such a damage as the procurers will not be able to repay us. We
can sooner leave our place and all our pleasant outward enjoyments than leave
that which was the first ground of wandering from our native country, nor are
we thereby made such strangers thereto but we can rather choose to return and
take up our lot with our brethren than abide here under the deprivement of the
end of our travells. Our way is with the Lord. Craving your honnors pardon, for
this bouldness, and offering up our best desires to the Lord for you, we
remain

Sir, Your humble sarvants, J. E. G. In the name of the general court.

To the right honorable Robt. Boil, Esquire Gov. of the corporation for the
propagation of the gospel in New England.
Copy of a Letter from Secretary Morice to the Massachusetts Colony.
Sirs,
HIS Majesty has heard this petition See Appendix to History of Massachusetts
Bay, V. I. p. 537.
read to him and has well weighed all the expressions therein, and the temper
and spirit of those who framed it, and does not impute the same to his colony
of the Massachusetts, amongst whom he knows the major part consists of men well
affected to his service and obedient to his government, but he has commanded
me to let you kow that he is not pleased with this petition and looks upon it
as the contrivance of a few persons who have had too long authority there, and
who use all the artifices they can to infuse jealousies into his good subjects
there and apprehensions as if their charter were in danger, when it is not
possible for his Majesty to do more for the securing it or to give his
subjects there more assurance that it shall not any degree be infringed, than
he has already done, even by his late commission and commissioners sent
thither, who are so far from having the least authority to infringe any clause
in the said charter, that it is the principal end of their journey, so
chargeable to his Majesty, to see that the charter be fully and punctually
observed; his Majesty did expect thanks and acknowledgments, from that his
colony, of his fatherly care in sending his commissioners thither, and which he
doubts not he shall receive from the rest of his colonies in those parts, and
not such unreasonable and groundless complaint as is contained in your
petition, as if he had thereby intended to take away your privileges and to
drive you from your habitations, without the least mention of any misdemeanour
or miscarriage in any one of the said commissioners or in any one particular;
nor can his Majesty comprehend (except you believe that by granting your
charter he has parted with his sovereign power over his subjects there) how
he could proceed more graciously, or indeed any other way, upon so many
complaints presented to him by particular persons of injustice done contrary to
the constitution of that government; from the other colonies for the oppression
they pretend to undergo by the power of that of the Massachusetts, by extending
their bounds and their jurisdiction further than they ought to do, as they
pretend; from the natives for the breach of faith and intolerable pressures
laid upon them, as they allege, contrary to all kind of justice, and even to
the dishonor of the English nation and christian faith, if all they allege be
true; I say, his Majesty cannot comprehend how he could apply proper remedies
to these evils, if they are real, or how he could satisfy himself whether
they are real or not by any other way or means than by sending commissioners
thither to examine the truth and grounds of all the alligations, and for the
present to compose the differences the best they can, until upon a full and
clear representation thereof to his Majesty, who cannot but expect the same
from them, his Majesty's own final judgment and determination may be had, and
it has pleased God so far already to bless that service that its no small
benefit his Majesty and his English colonies in those parts have already
received by the said commissioners in the removal of so inconvenient
neighbors as the Dutch have been for these late years, and which would have
been a more spreading and growing mischief in a short time, if it had not been
removed. To conclude, I am commanded by his Majesty to assure you again of
your full and peaceable enjoyment of all the privileges and liberties granted
to you by his charter, which he has heretofore and does now again offer to
renew to you, if you shall desire it, and that you may further promise
yourselves all the protection, countenance and encouragement that the best
subjects ever received from the most gracious Prince; in return whereof he
does only expect that duty and cheerful obedience that is due to him, and that
it may not be in the power of any malicious person to make you miserable by
entertaining any unnecessary and unreasonable jealousies that there is a
purpose to make you so; and since his Majesty has too much reason to suspect
that Mr. Endecott, Mr. Endecott died before the next election.
who has during all the late revolutions continued the government there, is
not a person well affected to his Majesty's person or his government, his
Majesty will take it very well if at the next election any other person of
good reputation be chosen in the place, and that he may noe longer exercise
that charge. This is all I have to signify unto you from his Majesty and
remain

Your very humble servant, Will. Morice.
Whitehall, Feb. 25. 1664.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. Davenport to Major General Leverett.
Honorable Sir,
LET my first salutation be my congratulation for this addition of a further
expression of Gods peoples affection and confidence in your courage, wisdom and
faithfulness for the interest of our Lord Jesus and the good and welfare of
church and commonwealth, in that they have unanimously called you to be one of
the assistants for governing the civil affairs in the court, as well as to be
their major general in the camp. The good Lord assist and govern you by his
spirit of wisdom, of courage, and of the fear of the Lord in both.

Sir, I received yours dated 27. 3d. 65. for which I return humble and hearty
thanks, and for the enclosed narrative, whereby I perceive that the powers of
darkness which have prevailed in other parts of the world are at work here
also, to subvert the kingdom of Christ in these ends of the earth. But God has
not yet said that this is their hour in reference to N. E. though our
unthankfulnes for the gospel, unfruitfulness under it, dissobedience to it,
declensions from the simplicity that is in Christ, and sinful compliances, etc.
have deserved that our hedge should be broken down. That admonition which
Christ sent unto the church at Ephesus should sound in our hearts continually,
Repent and do thy first works. For even David had his first and his latter
ways. Therefore it is noticed concerning Jehosaphat, in 2 Chronicles. 17.3. that
the Lord was with him, because he walked in the first ways of his father
David. If N. E. would return to the first ways of reformation here begun,
according to gospel rules and patterns (from which the compass of the last
synods conclusions seems to be varied by some degrees toward the antartique,
or is newly discovered to be other than I formerly apprehended to have been the
way of these churches) I would hope that the same only wise God who
dissappointed the council of that archprelate in the reign of the last king
(whereby your pattent was once and again demanded by the said king, and as
often refused by your general court, to be returned to England) would also
still appear, in this juncture, by frustrating the present design and making
it an abortion, or a mere trial of the country, whether they will stand to
their church rights and privileges or permit them to be invaded and violated
by such attempts, which when they are tried and found unsuccessful, will cease
for the future. For the Lord is and will be with his people while they are with
him; and if ye seek him he will be found of you. An experiment hereof you had
in the quiet proceeding of your elections, as a gracious answer to prayers.
Their claiming power to sit authoritatively as a court for appeals, and that
to be managed in an arbitrary way, was a manifest laying of a ground work to
undermine your whole government established by your charter. If you had
consented thereunto, you had plucked down with your own hands that house
which wisdom had built for you and your posterity. For all your courts would
then have signified nothing; the sentences of them being liable to be
dissannulled, upon complaints to the commissioners made by delinquents, as
appears in the case of Mr. Tho. Deane, etc. and the execution of the justest
censure might be hindered and the course of justice obstructed, as you have
already found in the case of John Potter. Nor can I see that your preserving
that authority and jurisdiction which the last king, by his roial charter, gave
you, can rationally be accounted an opposing the soveraignety which this king
has over you, seeing id possunt reges quod jure possunt. There is indeed a
verbal profession of preserving your liberties. But if the commission of these
gentlemen be of such a latitude as they say, it is a real destruction of that
which they promise to preserve. Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam? Therefore,
to me, the matter of your answer seems to be rational, just and necessary. As
for the solemnity of publishing it, in three places, by sounding a trumpet, I
believe you did it upon good advise, and therefore, suspending my own thoughts,
I shall wait to see how it is resented at the court in England. Yet, upon
serious second and third thoughts, I see not but that it was your prudent way
so to do, considering that, 1. It was the answer of the general court. 2.
Published in the kings name. 3. For the cognizance of the whole country
concerned in it. 4. For declaring the courage and resolution of the whole
country to defend their charter liberties and privileges, and not to yield
up their right voluntarily, so long as they can hold it, in dependence upon
God in Christ, whose interest is in it, for his protection and blessing, who
will be with you while you are with him. If my advise were worth any thing, I
would say, let a collection of your grievances occasioned by the coming over of
these commissioners, and by their actings, in one place and another, and of the
3 commissioners in prejudicing the Indians against the English, whereby the
good work for their conversion is in danger to be hindered and the safety and
peace of the English to be hazzarded, for the future; let, I say, all instances
of their illegal and injurious proceedings, throughout the country, be fully
collected and clearly proved, and speedily transmitted and represented to the
king, the lord chancellor, etc. by your next addres, and therein let them fully
and plainly understand that the whole country (for the generality of them) are
much aggrieved at these doings and humbly desire to be resettled in their
former state, according to their charter, and that they may be freed from
those new encroachments; wherein the petition to the general court presented
in the names of so many non-freemen, declaring their full satisfaction in the
settled government, as it is, with their earnest desire that it may be still
continued without alteration, may be signified to the higher powers, to good
purpose. Sir, You see whether my zeal for preserving Christ's interest in your
parts (though in N.H.C. New Haven Colony.
it is miserably lost) and my unfeigned love to your colonie and my fervent
desire of the welfare of the churches and commonwealth (so far as they may be
promoted and perpetuated by your circumspection) has carried me, through my
confidence in your wisdom and faithfulness, that you will make no other use of
this my scribbling then such as shall be safe both to you and me. To the
honorable governor you may communicate it, if you please, presenting also to
him my humble and affectionate service.

Sir, I return your copy of the articles that concern Commameene, having
received them formerly from your self, and lately from Mr. Bishop, with many
thanks to you for the sight and loan of them from us both. But I am and shall
be discouraged from regarding such agreement made by a subject, though
honorably, til I see your charter, sealed by the late King, and obliging his
heirs and successors, really as well as verbally confirmed and performed,
toward the purchasing whereof I paid 50 l. and Mr. Eaton 100 l. and sundry
other merchants the same sums respectively, we being members of the London
corporation for N. E. which does engage me to desire and endeavor, what I can
and may, that the intended effects thereof may remain, for the service of
Christ and for the good of all his people, both at present and for the future.
I hear well of your last address to the king. I should take it for a favor if
I might peruse it and the king's answer. I shall now cease from giving you any
further trouble, but not from praying for a good issue of your and our present
afflictive exercises, and not ours only but of the distressed churches of
Christ, in whom I rest,

Sir, Your obliged assured, John Davenport.

Copy of a Petition to the King from some of the Inhabitants of the Province of
Maine.
To the King's most excellent Majesty, The humble Petition of the Inhabitants
of Casco upon the Province of Maine in New England, wherein according to his
Majesty's command is rendered their reasons why they could not submitt to Mr.
Gorges.
Most dread Sovereign,
PARDON, we humbly beseech, if we presume to address our most gracious and
loveing father, whose gracious eye and fatherly care is toward us the meanest
of your subjects inhabiting the northern parts of your dominions in this
wilderness, as we understand by your gracious letter to us. For the which
fatherly and gracious care of us therein expressed we beseech, though we be
butt one of ten that presume to return thanks, pardon we humbly beseech you
our presumption, who have the royal scepter of your command for so doing,
and accept of our bounden thankfullnes, who upon our bended knees do return
unto your sacred Majesty most humble and hearty thanks for the same.

And whereas your Majesty was pleased to demand our submission to Mr. Gorges,
or else forthwith to render our reasons, may it please your most sacred
Majesty, we have noe reasons as of ourselves, having nothing to say against
Mr. Gorges or his government, butt if itt shall please your Majesty so to
determine itt, we shall willingly and cheerfully submitt to itt.

1 Reason. Butt when we first submitted to the government of the Massachusetts
we did engage to be under their government till such time as your Majesty
should determine us as proper to any other regulation, your Majesty being
pleased to send to them demanding, as we are informed, their resignation of
us, or else to show their reasons; which, they say, they have undertaken to
do, and therefore have commanded us in your Majesty's name to continue under
their government till itt shall be determined by your Majesty; against whom
we have nothing to say, butt have by good experience found that expression of
your Majesty verified concerning them, that whereas they have exceeded others
in piety and sobriety so God has blessed them above others, so we having
had piety so countenanced and justice so well executed that we have found
Gods blessing in our lawful callings and endeavors more in one year than in
several before or since our late troubles.

2 Reason. Since which, most gracious Sovereign, itt has pleased your
Majesty's most honorable commissioners to forbid our submission either to the
Massachusetts or Mr. Gorges; and we humbly beseech your Majesty not to
impute it to any disloyalty in us, if your Majesty find not our names
inserted in a petition directed to your sacred Majesty for the removal of the
government both from the Massachusetts and Mr. Gorges, we having noe just
cause of complaint against either, we being likewise taught out of the word of
God that obedience is better than sacrifice, especially of that which is none
of our own, and of which, for ought we know, your Majesty has long since
disposed of, or if not, we presume your Majesty knows better how to
dispose of your own than we to direct; we here professing to your sacred
Majesty it is the only height of our desires, withoutt any senister or by
respects, to be wholly and solie where God by his providence and your commands
shall cast us.

Thus having, according to your Majesty's commands and our weak abilities,
rendered all the reasons we have or know of, we humbly beg your Majesty's
determination, by reason of the sad contentions that has been and is now
amongst us, not without some threatening of us who did not join with our
neighbors in petitioning against Mr. Gorges and the Massachusetts, humbly
begging your gracious and fatherly eye to be toward us, we only desireing
as much as in us lies to act in the uprightnes of our hearts in the sight of
the Almighty, your sacred Majesty and all men, desireing rather to submitt
to, than to contend or direct what government or governors your Majesty shall
please to appoint over us.

Thus, with our prayers to the God of heaven to power upon your Majesty all
the blessings heaven and earth can afford, both spiritual, temporal and
eternal, beseech him in whose hands are the hearts of Kings to direct your
sacred Majesty so to dispose of us as may make most for the glory and honor
of God, your sacred Majesty, and the good of us your poor subjects, we
prostrate ourselves at your Majesty's feet and subscribe as your due and our
duty is,

Your Majesty's ever faithful and obedient subjects, to be obedient where
your Majesty shall please to command us to the utmost of our lives sad
fortunes. Henry Williams Ambrose Bounds George Lewis John Lewis Thomas Skilling

the Commissioners from Boston.
Gentlemen,
HEARING of your being at Strawbury bank, and being informed of your strict
course you intend against those that have supplicated his Majesty for their
freedom and liberty, I could not do less than in his Majesty's name require
you to take notice of this enclosed, which is a true coppie of a letter sent to
the Governor and Council of Boston, and in his Majesty's name I do again
desire and require you would forbear troubling or molesting such person or
persons in Strawbury bank, Dover or Exon, as has petitioned his Majesty,
until his Majesty's gracious pleasure be further known. This is all at
present but that I am,

Gentlemen, Your friend and servant, Robert Carr.

Copy of a Sentence of Court against Thomas Goold and others.
At a county court held at Cambridge, on adjournment, April 17. 1666.
THOMAS GOOLD, Thomas Osburne and John George These three persons scrupled
Infant Baptism, separated from the churches of the country and, with others of
the same persuasion with themselves, set up a church in Boston. Whilst
Congregationalists in England were complaining of the intolerant spirit of
Episcopalians there, Antipaedobaptists in New England had equal reason to
complain of the same spirit in the Congregationalists there.
being presented by the grand jury of this county for absenting themselves from
the public worship of God on the Lords days for one whole year now past,
alleged respectively as follows, viz.

Thomas Osburne answered, that the reason of his non-attendance was, that the
Lord has discovered unto him from his word and spirit of truth that the
society, wherewith he is now in communion, is more agreeable to the will of
God, asserted that they were a church and attended the worship of God together,
and do judge themselves bound so to do, the ground whereof he said he gave in
the general court.

Thomas Goold answered, that as for coming to public worship they did meet in
public worship according to the rule of Christ, the grounds whereof they had
given to the court of assistants, asserted that they were a public meeting,
according to the order of Christ Jesus gathered together.

John George answered, that he did attend the public meetings on the Lord's
days where he was a member; asserted that they were a church according to the
order of Christ in the gospel, and with them he walked and held communion in
the public worship of God on the Lord's days.

Whereas at the general court in October last, and at the court of assistants
in September last endeavors were used for their conviction. The order of the
general court declaring the said Goold and company to be no orderly church
assembly and that they stand convicted of high presumption against the Lord and
his holy appoyntments was openly read to them and is on file with the records
of this court.

The court sentenced the said Thomas Goold, Thomas Osburne and John George, for
their absenting themselves from the public worship of God on the Lords days,
to pay four pounds fine, each of them, to the county order. And whereas by
their own confessions they stand convicted of persisting in their
schismatic assembling themselves together, to the great dishonor of God and
our profession of his holy name, contrary to the act of the general court of
October last prohibiting them therein on penalty of imprisonment, this court
does order their giving bond respectively in 20 l. each of them, for their
appearance to answer their contempt at the next court of assistants.

The abovenamed Thomas Goold, John George, and Thomas Osburne made their
appeal to the next court of assistants, and refusing to put in security
according to law were committed to prison.

Copy of a Letter from Sir Richard Saltonstall to Mr. Cotton and Mr. Wilson.
This letter of Sir Richard Saltonstall was sent me by the Rev. Mr. Mather, but
too late to be brought into the collection in order of time. I have not seen
any other of Sir Richard's manuscripts and am very loath he should not have the
credit of this. It may well enough follow the sentence against Gould. It
discovers a good deal of that catholic spirit which too many of our first
settlers were destitute of, and confirms what I have said of Mr. Dudley's zeal
in the first volume of the Massachusetts History.

Reverend and dear friends, whom I unfaynedly love and respect,
IT does not a little grieve my spirit to hear what sadd things are reported
daily of your tyranny and persecutions in New England, as that you fine, whip
and imprison men for their consciences. First, you compel such to come into
your assemblyes as you know will not join with you in your worship, and when
they show their dislike thereof or witness against, then you stir up your
magistrates to punish them for such (as you conceyve) their public affronts.
Truly, friends, this your practice of compelling any in matters of worship to
do that whereof they are not fully persuaded, is to make them sin, for so the
apostle (Romans 14 and 23.) tells us, and many are made hypocrites thereby,
conforming in their outward man for fear of punishment. We pray for you and
wish you prosperity every way, hoped the Lord would have given you so much
light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and
not to practice those courses in a wilderness, which you went so far to
prevent. These rigid ways have laid you very low in the hearts of the
saints. I do assure you I have heard them pray in the public assemblies that
the Lord would give you meek and humble spirits, not to stryve so much for
uniformity as to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

When I was in Holland about the beginning of our wars, I remember some
christians there that then had serious thoughts of planting in New England,
desired me to write to the governor thereof to know if those that differ from
you in opinion, yet houlding the same foundation in religion, as Anabaptists,
Seekers, Antinomians, and the like, might be permitted to live among you, to
which I received this short answer from your then governor Mr. Dudley, God
forbid (said he) our love for the truth should be grown so could that we
should tolerate errors, and when (for satisfaction of myself and others) I
desired to know your grounds, he referred me to the books written here between
the Presbyterians and Independents, which if that had been sufficient, I needed
not have sent so far to understand the reasons of your practice, I hope you
do not assume to yourselves infallibility of judgment, when the most learned
of the Apostles confesses he knew but in part and saw but darkely as through
a glass, for God is light, and no further than he does illuminate us can we
see, be our parts and learning never so great. Oh that all those who are
brethren, though yet they cannot think and speak the same things might be of
one accord in the Lord. Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
thus minded toward one another, after the example of Jesus Christ our blessed
Savyor, in whose everlasting arms of protection he leaves you who will never
leave to be

Your truly and much affectionate friend in the nearest union, Ric. Saltonstall.

For my reverend and worthyly much esteemed friends Mr. Cotton and Mr. Wilson,
preachers to the church which is at Boston in New England, give this.
Copy of Mr. Cotton's Answer to a Letter from Sir Richard Saltonstall. If this
Letter should be thought, in some parts of it, not equal to what might be
expected from the general character of the writer, the reader will attribute it
to the prevailing bigotry of the age, and the cause which he undertook to
defend.

Honored and dear Sir,
MY brother Wilson and self do both of us acknowledge your love, as otherwise
formerly, so now in the late lines we received from you, that you grieve in
spirit to hear daily complaints against us, it springs from your compassion
of our afflictions therein, wherein we see just cause to desire you may never
suffer like injury yourselfe, but may find others to compassionate and condole
with you. For when the complaints you hear of are against our tyranny and
persecutions in fining, whipping and imprisoning men for their consciences, be
pleased to understand we look at such complaints as altogether injurious in
respect of ourselves, who had noe hand or tongue at all to promote either the
coming of the persons you aim at into our assemblyes, or their punishment for
their carriage there. Righteous judgment will not take up reports, much less
reproaches, against the innocent. The cry of the sins of Sodom was great and
loud, and reached up to heaven; yet the righteous God (giving us an example
what to do in the like case) he would first go down to see whether their
crime were altogether according to the cry, before he would proceed to
judgment, Genesis 18.20, 21. and when he did find the truth of the cry, he did
not wrap up all alike promiscuously in the judgment, but spared such as he
found innocent; we are amongst those whom (if you knew us better) you would
account of (as the matron of Abel spoke of herself) peaceable in Israel, 2 Samuel 20.19. Yet neither are we so vast in our indulgence or toleration as to
think the men you speak of suffered an unjust censure. For one of them
(Obadiah Holmes) being an excommunicate person himself, out of a church in
Plymouth patent, came into this jurisdiction and took upon him to baptize,
which I think himself will not say he was compelled here to perform. And he
was not ignorant that the rebaptizing of an elder person, and that by a private
person our of office and under excommunication, are all of them manifest
contestations against the order and government of our churches established (we
know) by Gods law, and (he knows) by the laws of the country. And we
conceive we may safely appeal to the ingenuity of your own judgment,
whether it would be tolerated in any civil state, for a stranger to come and
practice contrary to the known principles of their church estate? As for his
whipping, it was more voluntarily chosen by him than inflicted on him. His
censure by the court was to have paid (as I know) 30 pounds or else to be
whipped, his fine was offered to be paid by friends for him freely; but he chose
rather to be whipped; in which case, if his suffering of stripes was any worship
of God at all, surely it could be accounted no better than will worship. The
other (Mr. Clarke) was wiser in that point and his offense was less, so was
his fine less, and himself (as I hear) was contented to have it paid for
him, whereupon he was released. The imprisonment of either of them was noe
detriment. I believe they sared neither of them better at home, and I am sure
Holmes had not been so well clad of many years before.

But be pleased to consider this point a little further. You think to compel
men in matter of worship is to make men sin, according to Romans 14.23. If the
worship be lawful in itself, the magistrate compelling him to come to it
compels him not to sin, but the sin is in his will that needs to be
compelled to a christian duty. Josiah compelled all Israel, or (which is all
one) made to serve the Lord their God, 2 Chronicles. 34.33. yet his act herein was
not blamed but recorded amongst his virtuous actions. For a governor to suffer
any within his gates to profane the sabbath, is a sin against the 4th
commandment, both in the private householder and in the magistrate; and if he
requires them to present themselves before the Lord, the magistrate sins
not, nor does the subject sin so great a sin as if he did refrain to come.
If the magistrate connive at his absenting himself from sabbath duties the
sin will be greater in the magistrate than can be in the others passive
comeing. Naamans passive goeing into the house of Rimmon did not violate the
peace of his conscience, 2 Kings 5.18 19. Bodily presence in a stews, forced
to behold the lewdness of whoredoms there committed, is noe whoredom at all.
Noe more is it spiritual whoredom to be compelled by force to go to mass.

But (say you) it does but make men hypocrites, to compel men to conform the
outward man for fear of punishment. If it did so, yet better to be hypocrites
than profane persons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man,
but the profane person gives God neither outward nor inward man.

Your prayers for us we thankfully accept, and we hope God has given us so
much light and love (which you think we want) that if our native country were
more zealous against horrid blasphemies and heresies than we be, we believe
the Lord would look at it as a better improvement of all the great salvations
he has wrought for them than to set open a wide door to all abominations in
religion. Do you think the Lord has crowned the state with so many victoryes
that they should suffer so many miscreants to pluck the crown of sovereignty
from Christ's head? Some to deny his godhead, some his manhood; some to
acknowledge noe Christ, nor heaven, nor hell, but what is in a man's self? Some
to deny all churches and ordinances, and so to leave Christ noe visible
kingdom upon earth? And thus Christ by easing England of the yoke of a
kingdom shall forfeit his own kingdom among the people of England. Now God
forbid, God from heaven forbid, that the people and state of England should so
ill requite the Lord Jesus. You know not, if you think we came into this
wilderness to practice those courses here which we fled from in England. We
believe there is a vast difference between men's inventions and God's
institutions; we fled from men's inventions, to which we else should have
been compelled; we compel none to men's inventions.

If our ways (rigid ways as you call them) have laid us low in the hearts of
God's people, yea and of the saints (as you style them) we do not believe it
is any part of their saintship. Michal had a low esteem of David's zeal, but
he was never a whit lower in the sight of God, nor she higher.

What you wrote out of Holland to our then governor Mr. Dudley, in behalf of
Anabaptists, Antinomians, Seekers, and the like, it seems, met with a short
answer from him but zealous; for zeal will not bear such mixtures as coldness
or lukewarmenesse will, Revel. 2.2.14.15.20. Nevertheless, I tell you the
truth, we have tolerated in our church some Anabaptists, some Antinomians, and
some Seekers, and do so still at this day; though Seekers of all others have
least reason to desire toleration in church fellowship. For they that deny all
churches and church ordinances since the apostasy of Antichrist, they cannot
continue in church fellowship but against their own judgment and conscience;
and therefore 4 or 5 of them who openly renounced the church fellowship which
they had long enjoyed, the church said amen to their act, and (after serious
debate with them till they had nothing to answer) they were removed from their
fellowship. Others carry their dissent more privately and inoffensively, and so
are borne withal in much meekness. We are far from arrogating
infallibility of judgment to ourselves or affecting uniformity; uniformity God
never required, infallibility he never granted us. We content ourselves with
unity in the foundation of religion and of church order: Superstructures we
suffer to vary; we have here presbyterian churches as well as
congregationall, and have learned (through grace) to keep the unity of the
spirit in the bond of peace; only we are loath to be blown up and down (like
chaff) by every wind of new notions.

You see how desirous we are to give you what satisfaction we may to your
loveing expostulation, which we pray you to accept with the same spirit of
love wherewith it is endited. The Lord Jesus guide and keep your heart for
ever in the ways of his truth and peace. So humbly commending our due respect
and hearty affection to your worship, we take leave and rest. This and the
next preceding Letter are without date. Sir Richard was never in New England
after 1631. These Letters must have been wrote between 1645 and 1653.


Copy of a Letter from Col. Richard Nicolls to the Governor and Assistants of
the Massachusetts.
Gentlemen,
I HAVE lately heard that his Majesty has authorized and required you to
reduce Canada to his Majesty's obedience, therefore I think it my duty (for
several respects) to give you advertisement of an opportunity which presents it
self toward the facilitating (if not wholly effecting) the work at once. For
I have received letters yesterday that the French were marching (in number
according to Indyans computation about 700 men) toward Albany. I presume they
will not openly profess themselves enemies to us, till they have either
vanquished the Mohaukes, or made peace with them; however I have strengthened my
garrison in the fort to withstand their attempts; hereof I have also sent
governor Winthrop an account, and cannot imagine any reason to the contrary why
so fair an advantage against the French should be let slip, since his
Majesty's directions therein are so possitive. And truly if from your colony a
speedy force of horse and dragoones, not exceeding 150, would march and join
with a proportionable number of Conecticott colony, in all probability few of
the French could return to Canada, whose whole strength is now so far engaged
from home, and by consequence the rest of the French will not be able to make
any considerable resistance; the necessity of your speedy determination is so
evident, that I shall not make use of other arguments, only assuring you of my
utmost endeavors to serve his Majesty upon this occasion in the defense of his
dominions, not doubting but that the common safety is precious to you, although
the danger at present more immediately threatens this colony; I remitt the
consideration of the premises to your serious thoughts, and remain your very
affectionate friend and servant,

Richard Nicolls.
Fort James in New York, July the 6th 1666.
Copy of a Letter from the King's Commissioners to the Governor, etc. of the
Massachusetts.
Gentlemen,
ALthough we were credibly informed before your general court sat in
September last, and by diverse circumstances were jealous that the signification
of his Majesty's pleasure to yourselves, under his Majesty's sign manual and
subscribed by Sir William Morice, principal secretary of state, would not meet
with a full compliance in your general court; yet we were loath to credit
reports so derogatory to your dutiful submission to his Majesty's commandes;
and having seen the copy of an humble address to your general court, under
the hands of many considerable persons eminent for loyalty and estates within
your jurisdiction, wherein the petitioners did, with a modest importunity,
offer to their representatives their deep sense of the calamities which may
ensue, if his Majesty's just displeasure should be kindled against the
disobedient, we were full of hopes that the general court would have given
his Majesty due satisfaction to his commands, and particular thanks to those
gentlemen the petitioners: But being fully informed that your resolutions are
neither to send Mr. Richard Bellingham, your present governor, with Major
Hawthorne, who are expressly required upon their allegiance to attend his
Majesty, nor to make your choice of two or three other persons, as his Majesty
is pleased to direct you; and further, that you have not only discountenanced
but laid heavy charges against those loyal and dutiful petitioners, we
conceive ourselves, at last, highly obliged (as commissioners from his
Majesty) solemnly to manifest declare and protest, in the name and behalf of
his Majesty.

1. First, That his Majesty's signification of his pleasure to his colony of
the Massachusetts is an original signed by his Majesty, subsigned by Sir
William Morice principal secretary of state, See Appendix to Massa. Hist. Vol.
I. p. 547.
which ought to be received for authentic in all his Majesty's dominions, and
is so entertained in all the other his Majesty's colonies in New England, to
their joy and satisfaction, though with some blot upon record in your scutcheon.

2. Secondly, That his Majesty will be justly displeased with your resolutions
against sending the persons nominated in the signification, with such others as
you are positively commanded to make your own choice of, to attend his
Majesty, who expects from all his subjects obedience, as much more acceptable
than sacrifice.

3. Thirdly, That his Majesty cannot but approve of that humble petition
presented to your general court, and by the laws of England (which must be
the touchstone) those gentlemen ought not to be molested, fined, or imprisoned
for any matters contained in the said petition, so full of duty to his
Majesty, of respect to your general court, and tending to the peace and
welfare of the whole colony.

4. Lastly, We ourselves, fully concurring with the substance and to those
good ends manifested in the petition, do earnestly solicit you to resume the
whole matter into your most serious consideration, that his Majesty may be
honored with the real obedience of his subjects, and thereby encouraged
plentifully to pour forth the riches of his goodness upon his colony of the
Massachusetts, to which we are hearty well wishers and will contribute our best
endeavors at all times and in all places, when by your submission to his
Majesty, we shall be encouraged to remain

Your very affectionate friends and servants, His Majesty's Commissioners for
New England, Richard Nicolls, Robert Carr, Samuel Mavericke.

Fort James at New-Yorke, Nov. 3d, 1666.
Copy of a Letter from Governor Bellingham to Secretary Rawson.
Mr. Secretary,
THE letter which came under a cover to yourselfe from the hon. Col. Nichols,
Sir Robert Carr, and Mr. Samuel Mavericke, of the 3d instant, directed to
myself and the assistants of this colony, I received the 10th at evening, and
have perused with such of the magistrates as are adjacent, and finding the
contents thereof do refer to the actings of the general court. You may inform
Mr. Mavericke that the general court being dissolved sundry days since, their
return to the honorable Sir William Morris is dispatched by the ships gone
for England in the last month, yet at the first opportunity for the assistants
meeting this letter shall be communicated according to the direction thereof,
not else at present.

I am your loving friend. Ri. Bellingham, Gov. with the consent of those
present.
Present, Fr. Willoughby, Esquire Dep. Gov, Capt. Daniel Gookin, Mr. Ri. Russell,
Maj. Genesis Leverett, Mr. Thomas Danforth.

Boston, 13th 9mo. 1666.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Leverett to Sir Robert Carr, Knt.
Sir,
THERE being a complaint exhibited against you and your servant James Deane, of
your royatous and abusive carriag to one of his Majesty's officers, Richard
Bennet, one of the constables of this town, on Saturday last in the evening,
being the 19th instant, at the house of John Vyal, vintner. These are to
signifye to you that a hearing thereof is appointed upon Wednesday the 23d,
between nine and ten of the clock in the morning, at my house; from some
considerations I have chosen this way to give you notice thereof, that you,
with your man, may be present to give answer to what may alleged against you,
and the honor and authority of his Majesty, in his officers, may be
preserved, with the greatest respect to yourselfe the case will admit of,
wherefore your presence, with your man, at the time and place is desired. In
the interim, your speedy answer by the bearer, Capt. William Davis, to

Sir, Your servant, John Leverett.
Boston, 22 January 1666.
Copy of a Letter from Colonel Nicolls to the Governor and Council of the
Massachusetts.
Honored Gentlemen,
BY the hands of Mr. Samuel Mavericke, one of his Majesty's commissioners for
New England, you will receive herewith the perfect copy of his Majesty's
commands, which came lately to my hands, wherein you will read with how much
prudence and tender care his Majesty reflects upon the safety and welfare of
his remote colonyes. When you have perused the same, I will not doubt of your
readiness to comply, not only to that good end, but with the means, ways
and persons, which his Majesty is pleased to direct in that business; as you
may more at large find in his Majesty's warrant to his commissioners. Upon
conference with Mr. Samuel Maverick and the countenance of your authority, the
full contents of his Majesty's commands may be easily put in practice. In
sending this copy of his Majesty's commands to his commissioners unto
yourselves, I have obeyed my orders and directions from my Lord Arlington*
principal secretary of state, and remain

Your very humble servant, Richard Nicolls.
Fort James in New York, May the 9th, 1667.
Copy of a Narrative of the Commissioners from England, about New England.
THE colony of Conecticote returned their humble thanks to his Majesty for his
gracious letters and for sending commissioners to them, and made great promises
of their loyalty and obedience. And they did submit to have appeals made to
his Majesty's commissioners, who did hear and determine some differences among
them. All forms of justice pass only in his Majestyes name, they admit all
that desire it to be of their corporation; they will not hinder any from
enjoying the sacraments and using the common prayer book, provided that they
hinder not the maintenance of the public minister; they will amend any thing
that has been done derogatory to his Majestyes honor, if there be any such
thing, so soon as they shall come to the knowledge of it. The bounds betwixt
the Dukes province and Conecticote were mistaken by wrong information, for it
was not intended that they should come nearer to Hudson's river then twenty
miles, yet the line was set down by the commissioners to go from such a point
N. N. W. whereas it ought to go just N. otherwise the line will go into
Hudsons river. They have nothing to say against Duke Hamiltons pattent, but
their writings were burnt, and that they bought the land of the Lord Say and
Brook and others, and that his Majesty has confirmed it to them, and that they
never knew that the late Marquis Hamilton had a grant of it, for he never sent
any to take possession of it or to inhabit upon it. Their eastern bounds are
determined to be a line drawn westward from the midst of the road Pawtucket
river, near to Shaws house. Their northern bounds is the south line of the
Massachusetts, which, as the collony complains, is stretched much too
southerly. This colony has many good rivers and harbors, many scattering
towns not worthy of their names, and a scoller to their minister in every town
or village, but noe places fortified except Seabrook fort, which is much gone
to decay, and here, for the most part, they are rigid presbyterians.

The colony of Road Island and Providence plantations returned their humble
thanks to his Majesty for sending commissioners and made great demonstration
of their loyalty and obedience. They approved, as most reasonable, that appeals
should be made to his Majestyes commissioners, who having heard and determined
some causes among them, referred other some, in civility, to their general
court, and some to the governor and others; some of which causes they again
remitted to the commissioners to be determined. All proceedings are in his
Majestyes name, they admit all to be freemen that desire it; they allow liberty
of conscience and worship to all who live civilly, and if any can inform them
of any thing in their laws or practices derogatory to his Majestyes honor,
they will amend it. The Marquis of Hamiltons pattent takes in all Road Island
colony and about half of Conecticote. The Narhiganset Sachims did in the year
1664, by writing, surrender themselves, their people and country, into the late
Kings protection; two of which Sachims, now living, did actually, in their own
persons, surrender themselves, people and country, into his royal Majestyes
protection before his commissioners, and deliverd to them them that very deed
made in 1664, which had been carefully kept by Mr. Gorton, etc. whereupon the
commissioners, according to their instructions, entered upon the country in his
Majestyes name and have named it the Kings province, have taken the natives
into his Majestyes protection, and have appointed justices of the peace to
govern it until his Majestyes pleasure be farther known. For this Narhyganset
country is almost all the land belonging to the country, the which cannot
subsist without it, and therefore the commissioners ordered that the
magistrates for the colony should be justices of the peace for the Kings
province, that noe difference may arise betwixt the officers. The Sachims did
thankfully receive the two coats presented to them in his Majestyes name. In
acknowledgment of their subjection they are to pay yearly, upon the 26th of
May, two wolf skins to his Majesty, and did now send two caps of peague and two
clubs inlayed with peague for a present to the King, and a feather mantle and a
porcupine bag for a present to the Queen, which ware all taken by the Dutch.
One of these princes, named Passicus, desired the commissioner to pray King
Charles that noe strong liquor might be brought into that country, for he had
32 men that died by drinking of it. These Indian princes gave a long petition
to the commissioners, complaining of many acts of violence and injustice which
the Massachusetts had done to them: Among others, they first caused them to be
fined, then took their whole country in mortgage (according to the
remonstrance sent to his Majesty) and would have juggled them out of it; but
there could be noe redress, the Massachusetts refusing to let the commissioners
have the hearing of appeals. Their western bounds are determined with
Conecticote, their northern bounds must be the Massachusetts southern line,
wherever it falls (which they complain to be too southerly) their eastern
bounds betwixt them and New Plymouth could not be determined by consent of both
parties (Road Island claiming a shred of land 3 miles broad all the length of
the maine land lying next to the Narhyganset island, which they of New Plymouth
could not part with without great prejudice) whereupon commissioners appointed
the water (the natural bounds of each colony) to be their present bounds,
until his Majestves pleasure be farther known. Mr. William Brenton, deputy
governor of Road Island, having bought a farm upon that shred of land which he
hoped would belong to that colony, humbly desires his Majesty that he may
continue to possess that farm though it falls within the line of New
Plymouth, and Doctor Alcock, a physician, having bought Block Island for 400 l.
of some of Boston, who took upon them power (never granted them) to sell it,
and having been at great charges in planting of it, desires his Majesty that he
may not be dispossessed of it, he humbly submitting to the government of Road
Island; both these petitions to his Majesty are lost. This colony, which admits
of all religions, even Quakers and Gennerallists, was begun by such as the
Massachusetts would not suffer to live among them and is generally hated by the
other colonyes, who endeavored several ways to suppress them; they
maintained several other Indians against the Narhyganset Indians. The
commissioners of the united colonyes disposed of a great part of this country,
pretending they had conquered it from the Pequod Indians, but evidence being
made that the Narhygansets had conquered it before the English began their war,
and that the right was in him who had sold it to the Road Islanders, and his
Majestyes commissioners not thinking it justifiable for any colony to dispose
of land without their own lymits, determined it for the Road Islanders. The
Massachusetts did maintain Pumham (a petty Sachim in this province) twenty years
against this colony and his chief Sachim, and did, by armed soldiers, besiedge
and take prisoners Mr. Gorton, Howden, Weeks, Green and others in this
province, and carried them to Boston, put them in chains, and took eighty head
of cattle from them, for all which they could never yet get satisfaction. This
colony could never be acknowledged for a colony till his Majesty's charter was
published, though in the year 1643 they sent over some into England to procure
the King's charter then, but finding that unnatural war begun, and the King
gone from London, they took a charter from the lords and commons, which was
more then Newhaven did pretend to, and more then Conecticot could show, yet
these two were admitted colonys in their great combination, and Road Island
slighted. The Narhyganset bay is the largest and safest port in New England
nearest the sea and fittest for trade; this colony has two scattered towns
upon Road Island, two upon the maine land, and four small villages; here only
yet is lime stone found, and here only the governor and magistrates serve the
public at their own charge. In this colony is the greatest number of Indians,
yet they had never any thing allowed toward the civillizing and converting the
Indians, and in this colony they have the greatest playnes, but noe place of
strength fortified, although many places capable of fortification. In this
province is the best English grass and most sheep, the ground very fruitful,
ewes bringing ordinarily two lambs, corn yields eighty for one, and in some
places they have had corn twenty six years together without manuring. In this
province only they have not any places set apart for the worship of God, there
being so many subdivided sects they cannot agree to meet together in one
place, but according to their several judgments they sometimes associate in one
house sometimes in another.

The colony of New-Plymouth did submit to have appeals made to the
commissioners, who here had but one plaint to them, which was, that the
governor would not let a man enjoy a farm of four miles square which he had
bought of an Indian, the complaint soon submitted to the governor when he
understood the unreasonablenes by it. They are here constrained to persuade
men, sometimes to compel there, to be free men, so far are they from
hindering any. This colony is seated on a neck of land the baranest part of the
country. They were the first planters in New England, though the Massachusetts
got the first charter, and since has much straightened this colony by
stretching their line so much southerly. They showed their charter and gave a
copy of it to their commissioners, and told them they were so poor they could
not renew it; whereupon the commissioners took occasion to offer to get their
charter renewed and delivered to them at the commissioners own charge, if, for
a further demonstration of their loyalty, they would let his Majesty choose one
of three (whose names themselves should send to the King) to be their governor,
and this to be done every 3 year, or every 5 years, which they thought best.
The commissioners thought if this had succeeded in this the first colony they
had visitted it might have been a good example for the rest; but after the
general assembly had considered of it, with many thanks to the commissioners
and great protestations of their loyalty to the King, they chose to be as they
were. They have about twelve small towns, one saw mill for boards, one bloomary
for iron, neither good river nor good harbor, nor any place of strength; they
are so poor, they are not able to maintain scollers to their ministers, but
are necessitated to make use of a guifted brother in some places.

The collony of the Massachusetts was the last and hardliest persuaded to use
his Majestyes name in the forms of justice. In this collony, at the first
coming over of the commissioners, were many untruths raised and sent into the
collonyes, as that the King had sent to raise 5000 l. yearly for his Majestyes
use, whereupon Major Hawthorne made a seditious speech at the head of his
company, and the late Governor another at their meeting house in Boston, but
neither of them were so much as questioned for it by any of their magistrates.
The commissioners visitted all other collonyes before this, hoping both that
the submission and condescension of the other collonyes to his Majestyes
desires would have abated the refractorinesse of this collony, which they much
feared, and that the assistance of Colonel Nicholls (whom they expected) would
have prevailed much: But neither examples nor reasons could prevail with them
to let the commissioners hear and determine so much as those particular cases
(Mr. Deanes and the Indian Sachims) which the King had commanded them to take
care of and do justice in: And though the commissioners, who never desired
they should appear as delinquents but as defendents, either by themselves or by
their attorneys, assured them that if they had been unjustly complained of to
his Majesty, their false accusers should be severely punished, and their just
dealing made known to his Majesty and all the world, yet they proclaimed by
sound of trumpet that the general court was the supreamest judicatory in all
that province, that the commissioners pretending to hear appeals was a breach
of their privileges granted them by the Kings royal father and confirmed to
them by his Majestyes own letter, and that they should not permit it; by which
they have for the present silenced above 30 petitions which desired justice
against them, and were all lost at sea. To elude his Majestyes desire of their
admitting men civil and of competent estates to be freemen, they have made an
act, whereby he that is 24 years old, a housekeeper, and brings a certificate
of his civil life, another of his being orthodox in matters of faith, and a
third of his paying ten shillings, beside head money, at a single rate, may
then have liberty to make his desires known to the court, and then it shall be
put to vote. The commissioners examined many townships, and found that scarce
three in a hundred pay ten shillings at a single rate; yet, if this rate were
general it would be just; but he that is a church member, though he be a
servant and pay not two pence, may be a freeman: They will not admit any who
is not a member of their church to communion, nor their children to baptism,
yet they will marry their children to those whom they will not admit to
baptism, if they be rich: They did imprison and barbarously use Mr. Jourdan
for baptizing children, as himself complained in his petition to the
commissioners. Those whom they will not admit to the communion they compel to
come to their sermons, by forcing from them five shillings for every neglect;
yet these men thought their paying one shilling for not coming to prayers in
England was an unsupportable tyranny: They have put many Quakers to death, of
other provinces, for which also they are petitioned against; first they
banished them, as Quakers, upon pain of death, and then executed them for
returning: They have beat some to jelly, and have been otherwise exceeding
cruel to others, and they say the king allows it in his letters to them;
indeed they have misconstrued all the king's letters to their own sense. They
yet pray constantly for their persecuted brethren in England. They have many
things in their laws derogatory to his Majesty's honor, of which the
commissioners made a breviate and desired that they might be altered, but they
have yet done nothing in it; among others, whoever keeps Christmas day is to
pay five pounds. They caused at length a mapp of their territoryes to be made,
but it was made in a chamber by direction and guess: in it they claim fort
Albany, and beyond it all the land to the south sea. By their south sea line
they entrench upon the colonys of New Plymouth, Road Island and Conecticote;
and in the east they have usurped Capt. Masons and Sir Ferdinando Gorges
pattents; and said that the commissioners had nothing to do betwixt them and
Mr. Gorges, because his Majesty neither commanded them to deliver possession to
Mr. Gorges, or to give his Majesty reason why they did not. The commissioners
being at Perscataqua when they received his Majestyes letter which commanded
them to see the harbors fortified, etc. sent their warrants to four towns upon
that river, requiring them to meet at such a time and place to hear his
Majestyes letter read, one of these warrants was sent post to Boston, from
whence two marshalls are sent from the governor and counsel with another
warrant to forbid the towns either to meet or do any thing commanded them by
the commissioners, at their utmost perils; and withal sent an unbeseeming
letter to the commissioners, both which letter and warrant were lost at sea.
Col. Whaley and Gough were entertained by the magistrates with great solemnity
and feasted in every place, after they were told they were traitors and ought
to be apprehended; they made their abode at Cambridge until they were
furnished with horses and a guide and sent away to Newhaven; for their more
security, Capt. Daniell Gookin is reported to have brought over and to manage
their estates; and the commissioners being informed that he had many cattle at
his farm in the Kings province which were supposed to be Whalyes or Goughs,
caused them to be seized for his Majestyes use, till further order, but Capt.
Gookin, standing upon the privilege of their charter and refusing to answer
before the commissioners, as so, there was noe more done in it; Capt. Pierce
who transported Whaly and Gough into New England may probably say something to
their estate. They of this colony say that King Charles the first gave them
power to make laws and to execute them, and granted them a charter as a
warrant against himself and his successors, and that so long as they pay the
fifth part of all gold and silver oar which they shall get they shall be free
to use the privileges granted them, and that they are not obliged to the King
but by civillity; they hope by writing to tire the King, Lord Chancellor and
Secretaryes too; seven years they can easily spin out by writing, and before
that time a change may come, nay, some have dared to say, who knows what the
event of this Dutch war will be? This colony furnished Cromwell with many
instruments out of their corporation and their collidg, and those that have
retreated thither since his Majesty's happy return are much respected, and many
advanced to be magistrates. They did solicit Cromwell, by one Mr. Winslow, to
be declared a free state, and many times in their laws stiling themselves this
state, this common wealth, and now beleve themselves to be so. They demand
what taxes they please, but their accounts could never yet be seen. Some few
soldiers they keep at their castle; their governor has 100 l. yearly, every
magistrate 30 l. They convert Indians by hiring them to come and hear sermons,
by teaching them not to obey their heathen Sachims, and by appoynting rulers
amongst them over tens, twentyes, fiftyes. The lives manners and actions of
those whom they say are converted, cannot be distinguished from those who are
not, except it be by being hired to hear sermons, which the more generous
natives scorn. This colony, which has engrossed the whole trade of New England
and is therefore the richest, has many towns, but not one regularly built
within its just limitts, which the commissioners suppose to be Seconett brook
on the S. W. and Merimack river on the N. E. and two right lines drawn from
each of those two places, till they come within 20 miles of Hudson river, for
that river is already planted and given to his royal highness. Boston is the
chief town in it, and seated upon a peninsula in the bottom of a bay, which is
a good harbor and full of fish. It was fortified this year 1665 with two block
houses, they had, before, a castle upon an island in the road where ships must
pass, about 5 or 6 miles from the town. Their houses are generally wooden,
their streets crooked, with little decency and noe uniformity and, there,
neither months, days, seasons of the year, churches nor inns are known by
their English names. At Cambridg they have a wooden collidg and, in the yard, a
brick pile of two bays for the Indians, where the commissioners saw but one;
they said they had 3 or more at scooll. It may be feared this collidg may
afford us many scismaticks to the church, and the corporation as many rebels
to the king, as formerly they have done, if not timely prevented. In this
colony too the king has many loyal subjects, who petitioned this general
court at his Majesty's first coming in, for the owning of his Majesty, and now
lastly for complying with his Majesty's commissioners, but have had neither
answer nor good look since; they are sorry that so few (for there are scarce
above 8 of the most factious) should carry on so strong a faction, yet they
are so overawed that they can do nothing to remedy it. They only say it is
now with them as it was with the king's party in Cromwell's time; one of those
was derided for being so civil to accompany one of the commissioners from the
town where he lived to Boston, and others in Boston derided those of Road
Island for having yielded so much to the commissioners. In Boston lies 10 iron
guns brought from the French fort taken in Cromwell's time, which would do
well at Pescataqua to defend the mouth of that river, where the masts are
laden, if they be the king's. On the 10th of September 1664 they published by
order of court a paper to deter and affrighten all from making any complaints
to the commissioners. The commodities of the country are fish, which is sent
into France, Spain and the Streights, pipe staves, masts, firr boards, some
pitch and tarr, pork, beef, horses, and corn, which they send to Virginia,
Barbados, etc. and take tobacko and sugar for payment, which they after send
for England. There is good store of iron made in this province; their way of
government is common wealth like; their way of worship is rude and called
congregational, they are zealous in it, for they persecute all other forms.

New Hampshire is the name of a province granted to Capt. Robert Mason about
the year 1635, and was to begin on the sea coast 3 miles E. of Merimack river,
and reaches to Pescataqua, and 60 miles of that breadth up into the country;
but now it is usurped by the Massachusetts who pretend that it is within their
bounds, and that the people petitioned to be within their protection; it is
true that difference of oppinion made a division among them, and a few who were
for congregationall churches did petition for their assistance, by which
occasion, partly by force and partly by composition, they have engrossed the
whole and named it Norfolk. When the Massachusetts charter was first granted,
the mouths only of the two rivers, Charles and Merimack, were known to them,
for they durst not travill far up into the country, presently after there was a
house erected three large miles from Merimack, which was for 17 years called
and known to be the bounds of the Massachusetts, and in that time was this
pattent granted to Capt. Mason. Mr. Wheelwright was banished out of the
jurisdiction of Massachusetts and was permitted to inhabit immediately beyond
the bound house, as himself gave testimony before the commissioners. Mr. Mason
had a pattent for some land about Cape Ann before the Massachusetts had their
first pattent, whereupon Capt. Mason, and Mr. Cradock, who was the first
governor of the Massachusetts and lived in London, agreed that the
Massachusetts should have that land which was granted to Capt. Mason about
Cape Ann, and Capt. Mason should have that land which was beyond Merimack
river, and granted to the Massachusetts. This agreement was sent to Mr. Henry
Joslin to get recorded at Boston, but before he could have leisure to go
thither he heard that Capt. Mason was dead, and therefore went not, of this he
made affidavit before the commissioners, who forbore to do any thing about the
limitts of this province till this might more fully be proved, though the
generallity of the people petitioned to be taken from under the tyranny of the
Massachusetts, as themselves styled it. The Massachusetts, since they have had
the government of this land, have granted and divided the province into
several townships, which are very long and thin, three of which are seated upon
Pescataqua river, which is a very good harbor and very capable of
fortification; here are excellent masts gotten, and here dry docks might be
made, and upon the river are above twenty saw mills, and here are great store
of pipe staves made, and great store of good timber spoiled.

The province of Main begins at the E. side of Pescataqua, and reaches to
Kennebeck river; it was named and granted to Sir Ferdinando Gorges by king
Charles the first, but was usurped also by the Massachusetts under pretense
that it was within the limitts of their charter, and that the people petitioned
to be under their government, and they named it Yorkshire. One gentleman, who
refused to submitt to the Massachusetts and suffered great loss by them,
showed the commissioners a warrant the Massachusetts made to have him brought
to Boston alive or dead, and now demands justice against them. This province
upon petition of the inhabitants and the difference betwixt Mr. Gorges
commissioners and the Massachusetts, his Majesty's commissioners took into his
Majesty's protection and government, and appointed justices of the peace to
govern them until his Majesty's pleasure be farther known. The inhabitants
afterward petitioned his Majesty that they might allways continue under his
Majesty's immediate government, and that Sir Rob. Carr might continue their
governor under his Majesty, which petition was lost at sea: In this province
also lives an Indian Sachim, who lives near to the great lake, from whence
flows Merimack river; petitioned his Majesty to take him into his protection,
which was also lost. In this province there are but few towns and those much
scattered, as generally they are throughout New England; they are rather farms
than towns: But in this province there is a bay called Casco bay, in which are
very many islands, two outletts to the sea, many good harbors and great store
of fish and oysters, crabs and lobsters. In this province, as in all the rest
there are great store of wild ducks, geese and deer in their seasons,
strawberyes, rasberyes, goosberyes, barberyes, and several sorts of
billberyes, several sorts of oaks and pines, chestnut trees, wallnut trees,
sometimes for four of five miles together; the northerly the country the better
the timber is accounted: On the N. E. of Kenibeck river, which is the bounds of
the province of Mayn, upon Shipscot river and upon Pemaquid, 8 or 10 miles
asunder, are 3 small plantations belonging to his royal highness, the biggest
of which has not above 30 houses in it, and those very mean ones too, and
spread over 8 miles at least. Those people, for the most part, are fishermen
and never had any government among them, most of them are such as have fled
hither from other places to avoid justice. Some here are of opinion that as
many men may share in a woman as they do in a boat, and some have done so.
The commissioners, for necessity sake, have appointed the best whom they could
find, in each place, to be a justice of peace, and have ordered 3 of those
justices of the peace in the province of Mayn, who live next to them, to join
with them in holding of sessions, till further order be taken. In these parts
are the best white oaks for ship timber. All the lands granted to his royal
highness in these north parts of New England, except these 3 plantations, are
also granted to Sir Thomas Temple, in the pattent of Nova Scotia. This
Narrative was undoubtedly the work of the Commissioners, or some Person
employed by them. The prejudice against the Massachusetts Colony, where they met
with the greatest opposition, appears in a strong light.


Copy of a Letter from the Governor and Assistants of the Massachusetts Bay to
Governor Willoughby at Barbados.
Boston in New England, August 21. 1667. Sir,
YOURS of July 1667 we received by the hand of Capt. Henry Addy, who through
the blessing of God arrived here safe the 14th of this instant. Some few days
before whose arrival a letter from his Excellency the Lord Willoughby, your
honorable father, intimating the seasonablenes of some present supply to be
made from hence for the relief of his Majesty's fleet with you, was received,
and care taken speedily to provide and send such provisions as we in our poor
capacity are able, which provisions are now putting on board the good ship
called the Hopewell, whereof under God Capt. John Allen is commander, and are
appointed to be delivered to your honorable father, to be disposed for the ends
abovesaid, as his Excellency in his wisdom shall see meet. We do acknowledge
ourselves greatly obliged to his Excellency for his great favor and respects
had for this his Majesty's colony, the expressions whereof, clothed with much
love and candor, we have sundry ways good assurance that they are real, and
that his Lordship does cordially seek our peace, and should we be wanting to
a due acknowledgment thereof, we hope we should be the first that should
blame ourselves for so great a neglect. In refferrence to your motion for
provisions for the supply of Capt. Addy, we have endeavored to answer your
proposal and expectation therein, although by reason of Gods having diminished
our crops for sundry years past, by blasting, etc. especially our wheat, in
conjunction with the present season of the year, when old store is spent, and
new not being come in as yet, we cannot in all respects accommodate him as
were meet, yet according to our capacity we have endeavored the same, as
himself, we doubt not, will more particularly inform. And we shall be ready
from time to time to encourage our merchants and traders in their exportation
of provisions for your further recrute to the uttermost of our power.

As to a supply of men from hence, your motion therein has been also seriously
weighed by us, and in sundry respects it does not appear feaseable to be
effected, so as may be to the answering of your expectation, nor yet with the
safety of this his Majesty's colony at this juncture.

Sir, With a due acknowledgment of your honors great civility manifested in
yours, and our hearty prayers to the God of heaven for his blessing to
accompany all your lawful endeavors for the suppressing of the common enemy
of our King and nation, under whose guidance and protection we leave you, and
shall remain

Sir, Your honors wherein we may serve you, R. B. Gov. F. W. Dep. Gov.
In the name and by the order of the Council.

Voted by the Council, 1 August 1667.

Copy of a Letter from Colonel Nicolls to the Governor and Assistants of the
Massachusetts, respecting the Province of Maine.
Worthy Gentlemen,
I Was for some time past very unwilling to believe that you would reassume a
power of government in the province of Main or Yorkshire, the absolute
decision whereof is lodged with his Majesty; and surely it will appear an open
breach of duty that any of his Majestyes inferior courts should usurp a
power over towns and persons after it has pleased his Majesty to signify his
pleasure to yourselves, in these following words: "And for the better
preventing of all differences and disputes upon the bounds and lymitts of the
seaverall collonyes, his Majestyes pleasure is, that all determinations made by
his Majestyes said commissioners with reference to the said bounds and lymitts
may still continue and be observed till upon a full representation of all
pretenses his Majestye shall make his own final determination," etc. Which
very words you will find in your own letter from his Majesty, concluding
thus: "And his Majesty expects that full obedience be given to this
signification of his pleasure in all particulars. Given at the court at
Whitehall, the 10th day of April 1666, in the 18th year of his Majestyes
reign, by his Majestyes command, Wm. Morice." But I have now seen the order
of your last general court, in answer to the petition of some restless and
unquiet spirits, wherein your resolution is already taken to send commissioners
to keep a court and to exercise justice, etc. as under your government. I know
you have force enough to compel most of your neighbors to submitt to your
government; but if you think his Majestyes arm will never be stretched forth
to defend his subjects from usurpation, you may attempt any thing under the
notion of settling peace and order. I dare not be silent in a matter so
expressly contradictory to his Majestyes signification, dated 10th April 1666,
Appendix to Hist. Massa. Vol. I. p. 547.
for though some of your great people have spread a report that the said
signification was never known to or owned by his Majesty, and probably for
that reason the general court was induced to issue forth the aforesaid order,
yet you are to expect that his Majesty will own his hand, and Sir William
Morris will require sattisfaction for such scandalous aspersions upon him,
being principal secretary of state. In short, you will find that province
already settled by his Majestyes commissioners in peace and order, except some
few turbulent spirits. You may read his Majesty has made a temporary
confirmation thereof, why then are you so hasty to enter upon a thing of this
nature, or how can you say that you have heard nothing since that might
discourage or weaken your title to the said government? I am necessitated to
write in these plain and large terms because the shortness of my time in
these parts will not permit me to give you a visit, but will tell you my
fears, that if you proceed to compel an alteration of government in the
province of Main, by subverting there present establishment as it now stands
circumstanced, in all likelihood you may cause blood to be shed, for it is both
natural and lawful for men to defend their fast rights against all invaders.

Gentlemen, I shall send a coppie of this my letter with an original of his
Majesty's aforesaid signification to those gentlemen of the said province, and
there leave the decision betwixt God and yourselves; my hearty wishes and
prayers shall be to the Allmighty that you may be endued with the spirit of
obedience, charity, meekness and brotherly love, houlding yourselves within
these bounds, you may be happy upon all the points of the compass, and I am
sure noe man can wish you better than your affectionate humble servant,

Richard Nicolls. This Col. Nicolls appears to have been a very worthy good
man, true to his (...), but at the same time discreet; and he gained the esteem
of the people of the Massachusetts, who loved the man when they were making
opposition to his measures.

Fort James in New-Yorke, June 12th 1668. For his much respected friends the
Governor and Assistants of his Majesty's colony of the Massachusetts in Boston.



Copy of a Letter from several dissenting Ministers in and about London to the
Magistrates and Ministers in Massachusets-Bay.
Right Worshipful, Reverend and Beloved,
WE received yours dated from Boston Aug. 21. 1671. directed to many of us,
which also we have several times considered, as the providence of God has
permitted to us opportunities of meeting together. The importance of the
contents thereof, together with the honor and respect we owe you all, obliges
us to return you such answer as we are at present capable of, according to that
disposal which it has pleased the infinitely wise God to make of us in our
stations, and also of the conditions which he has measured out to his people
amongst whom he has placed us, from whom, as well as ourselves, you cannot
expect (as things stand with us) to receive that fruit that either your need
calls for or our love would produce, were we not ourselves, together with the
churches of Christ in these nations, entangled in many straits, and thereby
called to a more universal designment of what God has graciously left his
poor people to the supportation of the interest of his gospel and the
ministers and professors thereof, whose daily relief depends, as to many
counties, principally upon this city, from whom also we must promise ourselves
the greatest part if not all of that little we can hope to attain to, to
express the value we have for the interest of our dear Lord Jesus amongst you,
and more especially the promoting of the continuance of it in our assistence to
the education of such as may by the blessing of his grace and spirit be useful
in their generation for the running and glorifying of his gospel in and by
your numerous growing posterity.

As to the three branches of your letter, which comprize the whole of it, we
do according to the best of our judgments represent our thoughts to you which
we hope will be acceptable to you, as you may find in it any labor of love
toward you.

First, We join with you in that humble thankfulness which is due to the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he has for so long a time planted
and continued amongst you a school of the prophets, from whence have issued
such instruments as God has used for service to himself, even in both
Englands, and heartily condole, that not only the dead stones, but also the
living ones in that foundation are so much crumbled and diminished, and gladly
would we contribute our helping hand to the repairing of the one and the
reviving of the other, were our power suited to our wills. But upon
consideration of the straits and troubles the ministers and churches of Christ
are here wrestling with, and after consultation had with some wise and godly
gentlemen, sincere lovers of you, we find in ourselves and them the concentring
of the same thoughts, that the exhausted purses of those that are most able to
contribute, cannot reach any sum considerable toward the repair of the
edifice, so many of God's servants here calling for daily relief, even of
necessaries to them and their impoverished families, yet have we advised about
sending you what assistance God shall enable us unto for the maintenance of
Fellows and Tutors for the instruction and education of youths, who may be bred
up in good literature and fear of the Lord, for future employment in church and
commonwealth, in which we can say there is a real zeal for you and them in
this great concern. Several ways have been proposed and debated, we cannot
yet acquaint you with any fully determinate means for effecting, yet this we
were willing to advise you of, that you are in our hearts, and that we are
fully purposed (if the present liberty we have to meet be not interrupted by
those presaged hurryes which seem to be in the womb of Providence coming upon
us) to use all our endeavor to collect such sums of money (and so to dispose
them by the best advice we can take) as may in time amount to some comfortable
help toward the end which we specified before, in the service whereof we judge
that which is most necessary for you (at least that we are capable of) may be
attended.

2dly, As we desire to bless God with and for you, that so reverend and
judicious a person as your president has for so long a time been continued
with you, and that so usefully, so it is a grief of heart to us that there
appears none amongst yourselves to succeed him in that employment, and more
that we cannot find persons whose hearts God has touched to go over to you,
in order to a supply of that expected loss which you mention; yet, if our
advice herein be worth attending to, we would suggest, that it having pleased
God to stir up the heart of our beloved friend Dr. Hoar to intend a voyage
toward you by this shipping, we do suppose a speaking providence in it, and
do judge that God has so far furnished him with the gifts of learning and
the grace of his spirit, as that if your judgments concur with ours and his
inclinations (if God shall bring him to you) he may in some measure supply that
want and help to make up this breach, and we shall hope and pray that it may be
to some good fruit to you and yours.

3dly, For what concerns our promoting the sending of youths over to you for
their education, we can say no more but this, that where we find any inclined
so to dispose of their children, we shall not be wanting to encourage it as
far as we hear there shall be reason for it, by the Lords provision of such
help amongst you as shall be continued yet unto you or further added by him in
whose hands is the residue of the spirit, to be poured out on you and on your
seed, according to his covenant. So commending you to the Lord and to the word
of his grace we remain

Your servants in the Lord and for the gospel, Ph. Nigh John Knowles Joseph
Caryl William Hook George Griffith Geo. Cockayn John Collins. John Owen Matt.

27th April 1672. My dear Child,
HOW greatly do I long to see thee, but seeing that cannot be, thy choych
lettars do much refrech my drouping heart, to hear of thy health and
happynes, with thy dear friend, Whaley, her father.
is the chief comfort I have in this world, next to sole marcise. I receved
yours of the 6 of november, I cared the enclosed and did as you desired, which
I parseved was liked better then a lettar would have been from you; he hoped to
send something but not yet, he told me you wantid nothing so far as he could
undarstand, I which you find it so, but the Lord is very grashous to you and us
in taking care, and it is a choyc marcy not to want that the Lord will not have
us to enjoy, it is the work of the Lord to bring our minds to our condishon, but
I find hope desired makes the heart sick, but the Lord is plesed to be the
veshion in the applycation of some word or other, as that I will never leve thee
nor forsake thee, I will be your God and the God of your sead, and throe marcy
I have found it in some meshere maid good, for Frank is, I bles the Lord,
receved into the chorch and gave great sattisfaxon to all that ware present,
theare was eldars, deakons and some other of the membars that spoke with her at
forced and the whole church was sattisfid in her, and I hope the Lord who has
begone the work will finnesh it to his glory and our comfort that she may help
keep up the name of the Lord in the world when we are laid in the do. I found
the enclosed, it being of her one writing, I have sent it to thee that we may
rejoice and bles the Lord together for so great a marcy; a porshon in him self
is the best porshon for this cannot be lost, the Lord help us all to love him
more and then the parting with earthly comforts will not be so grevous to us as
it it is, dear Mrs. Jane has sent some goods she being persuaded that it would
be best this year, if the Lord plese to send them safe and that they be well
maneged for you and your friends benefit. I trust the Lord will make it of some
comfort to you, for my aunt took great pains to send it before the war begone
and we hope it is gone safe, we desire to follow it with prayers. If you be good
lads and will send word what you want theare will be care taken to soply you,
but tell then I forbear to send because it is your desire. I bles the Lord I
want nothing but thy dear company and thy friends. Give all the glory to God
he is the giver of all our marceyes. It will not be long but I must be gone to
those manshones that Christ has prepared for me and all that love the Lord;
theare will be no sorrow but fulness of joy and pleshures for ever more; but if
it may stand with the pleshure of my father I should be glad to see thee and
pease upon Isarell onse more, but I fear I am not worthy of such a marcy, but
the Lord Jesus Christ is, for whose sake he will appear in the best time. I
have sent you the enclosed by which you may see that the pepell of God enjoy
much liberty at the present but what the eshue of it may be the Lord knows. The
war with the Duch is like to be very terabel; the Lord ordar all things for his
one glory; Christ is the head of the church and that may comfort us in the
medst of all these commoshons. I bles the Lord I and your sistars and other
friends are in health, only Betty is weakly, my ant takes great care of my

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Collins This Mr. Collins was educated at
Harvard College and was a Minister in New England, afterward in London. The
Colony having no Agent in England he seems, for several years, to have been the
person principally employed to receive and give the necessary intelligence
relative to public affairs.
to Governor Leverett.
Sir,
I Would not let this ship go without a few lines to you, however I have
little to say, saving the recommendation of the gentleman the bearer hereof,
being Dr. Hoar, who is in fellowship with us, and yet more yours than ours,
through his ardent desire to serve God in what work he will allot to him in
your parts, where he has had his education, which in the judgment of wiser
men than myself is thought to be in your college employment, to which he is
very well qualifyed in many things. I know whatever countenance or
encouragement yourselfe can give him or the magistracy he shall not want it,
for I believe he will deserve it and continue so to do, to him also I do
refer an account of the state of things amongst us, which he will be better
able to do than I can by letters have at present opportunity for, he knowing
all I can write and the conveyance being very hazardous, the ship going out
when the 2 fleets, ours and the French on the one part and the Dutch, are both
out and plying toward one another for an engagement, only this I would add,
that the lord I spoke of is upon going and in likelihood will, before he
return, visitt you, which is to be emproved to the best of your advantage;
he is a very civil noble person, and if noe offense be ministered to him there,
will do you much service and, I persuade myself, noe hurt if it were to gain
the whole country, but keep all I have wrote about him to yourselfe, or as
secret as may be. Your friends and relations are all well, as I and my family
through grace are. I desire you to accept the tender of my humble service to
you and your lady, with my wifes, and commend you to the Lord, begging his
presence and grace with you in your great work; and that when you are nearest
God you would fervently remember me and mine which is great and weighty. I
rest,

Sir, Your very affectionate friend and humble servant, J. C.
London, May 10. 1672.
Copy of the Elders Advice to the General Court.
WHEREAS it has pleased this honnourable general court assembled and setting
in Boston the 15th of May 1672, to call us several of the elders of the
churches in this colonie, to consider, consult and advise concerning the
present difficult emergencies before them, in order to the free, full and
amicable concurrence of both houses in managing such cases of judicature as are
represented unto this court, by petition or otherwise, according to law; we
thought incumbent on us as an indispensable duty, pressed under the sense of
the great consequence of the question, it being to us a matter of the greatest
importance, on the one hand, to say nothing that might in the least impair the
honor, power and authority due to the honored magistrates, or, on the other,
infringe, weaken or make void the liberties, privileges or power by our
constitution appertaining to the freemen, both which are more dear to us than
our lives; seeing that in the temperament of both stands the firmness of our
civil being and the happiness of this whole people, in the preservation of the
common interest; we thought good humbly to suggest as the result of our
serious thoughts on the whole conference, that it pleased this honored
general court to admit us unto the hearing of amongst themselves for our
formation in the state of the case, these proposals following.

1. That our civil constitution respecting both the form and administration of
civil government, it is or ought to be founded in and upon our charter by which
we are incorporated into a body politic, and furnished both with legislative
and executive power, and gives life and strength both to the being and
operations of our civil polity, and makes us a people.

2. That therefore this our charter is to be kept and observed inviolably in
all the fundamentalls of civil policy, therein directing to the right
constitution of courts and regular distribution of differing interest of power
and privilege between the magistrates and the freemen, and the distinct
exercise of legislative and executive power by those who are by pattent vested
therewith.

3. That in any particular which does admit a latitude of interpretation and
fall under a different understanding amongst us, such a just accommodation as
may consist with our patent and best provide for the public satisfaction and
safety is most advisable.

4. That although we concur fully with those our worthy predecessors in the
ministry who when called to give their advice in the like, if not the same
case, have placed the negative vote in the major part of both houses, as, in
their understanding, most agreeable to the charter and conducible to the
public weal of this colony, as by their manuscripts yet extant more fully
does appear:

Yet, for a present accommodation (we humbly conceive) that our honored
magistrates bill referring to the issuing of all debates in matters of
judicature (in case of the non-concurrence of both houses voting apart) unto
the vote of the whole court met together, or the major part of them, whereof
the governor, deputy governor and four magistrates, or otherwise five of the
magistrates at least shall always be a part, to the making any valid act; we
say we humbly conceive that a mutual concession hereunto and a joint
concurrance herein may be a sit medium of such an accommodation, as that
which falls within a true latitude of interpetation, and for this we humbly
submit our reasons to your consideration.

1. Because the patent does expressly make and denominate two distinct estates
constituting this corporation, as 1st, That of the governor, deputy governor
and assistants. 2dly, That of the freemen. Therefore, either to confound these
two estates of magistrates and freemen, so as that there should be noe
distinction in the exercise of executive power, or to divest the magistrates of
the exercise of all executive power, or to invest the freemen with a power
equal unto, and in case above, the magistrates in the final determination of
matters of judicature; or to swallow up the whole estate of the magistracy,
with all their interest of place, power and patent right together, by a major
vote of the freemen in court, does seem to us to shake and overthrow the
boundaries of two distinct estates laid in the charter.

2. Because the patent does, according to our understanding of it, constitutue
a quorum of the magistrates in all general courts, with whom there is a
negative vote in matters properly appertaining to that court, else what means
that clause diverse times industriously inserted, of which the governor, deputy
governor and six of the magistrates shall be seven, which, if so, then totally
to null that quorum and negative vote together, seems to us to be a
fundamental error in government, according to patent.

3. Because, to leave the final determination of judicature in any case
altogether to the freemen, does tend to evacuate our great liberty and
privilege of election, as to one main end of it, unto which our honored
magistrates are solemnly sworn, viz. the administration of eivil justice
according to the laws of the land, which they cannot possibly do if
altogether superseded by the major vote of the freemen in general court; all
which, we humbly conceive would be prevented if the aforesaid accommodation
may be attained.

5. That for the prevention of trouble and expense of time to the honored
general court, by hearing and determineing cases civil or criminal, it
seems expedient, by law, to provide that there may be a more open way to an
issue of such cases in inferior courts of judicature, by the agreement of
bench and jury, and that the magistrates may be, by express law, directed to
accept the juries verdict and to grant judgment accordingly, unless they shall
judge the juries verdict to be evidently contrary to law and evidence, in which
case, that they may be empowered by law to cause the jurie to answer for their
default, in the same court, before a jurie of twenty four persons chosen by the
freemen, or otherwise to be liable to be served by the party aggrieved with a
writ of attainder out of the same court, or otherwise as this honored court
may see more aptly and amply to provide.

It being the great liberty of an English subject to be tried by his peers,
before whom he has free and full liberty to plead law for his indempnitie and
safety.

6. That when the worthy deputies in general court engage as judges in matters
of judicature it may be thought meet and just that they are sworn according
to law, so far at least as the magistrates are sworn, which seems necessary
in reason.

1st, That acting jointly and together with the magistrates they may act under
the same obligation of law and conscience. It seems very incongruous, that of
joint judges some should be sworn to judge according to law, and others left
with a latitude to judge according to judgment and conscience only, and so that
the magistrates should be only judges and the deputies judges and chancellors
in the same court.

2d. That our persons, names, estates, lives, and all, may be under the
protection of law, which is the great security of the subject, and that it may
not rest in the judgment and conscience of any of our judges to vacate our
laws and in an extrajudiciall way to pass judgment in any case under a legal
cognizance.

7. The premises notwithstanding, we humbly propose, whether that such cases
as are already lying before or depending in this honorable court, either by
petition or otherwise, may not, for the furtherance of the accommodation
abovesaid, be admitted unto a hearing in the wonted way of procedure in this
court as heretofore.

These proposalls we do in all humillity and faithfulness present and
submit unto the serious considerations of this honorable court, and being
under the awful sense of the great necessity of the amicable agreement of both
houses in such a time as this, we do most humbly and unfaynedly beseech him
who is the wonderful counselor and prince of peace, of whose government and
peace there shall be no end, that he would guide you by his counsel and fill
you with the spirit of wisdom and counsel and of the fear of the Lord, to
make you of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord, that you may be
able to discern and conclude upon such a way of agreement in this matter as
may be for the glory of his name, peace and welfare of his people here and
your account with joy in the great day of the Lord.

Samuel Whiting, sen. John Oxenbridge, consenting as to the substance and scope
which is the accommodation. Thomas Cobbet, John Shearman, John Higginson,
Thomas Thacher, sen. William Hubbard, John Wilson, James Allen, I fully agree
to the accommodation propounded in this paper. Samuel Phillips, Samuel Torrey,
Antipas Newman. John Hale, I concur fully with the substance of this
accommodation. Josiah Flint.


Copy of a Letter from Mr. Peter Tillton to his Wife at Hadley.
Boston 18 3mo. 1672. Dear Wife,
THIS opportunity gives occasion of these lines, we have had a quiett and
peaceable election, no alteration or addition; O what a price does divine
patience yett betrust us with, when he is drawing out the sword and arraying
himself with the garments of vengeance as to other kingdoms, and when it is
more than probable many garments are tumbling in blood. As to the news from
England all men, both wise and others of more ordinary cappassityes, look on
the effect or produce thereof will be as black a day in the world, as the
world has known. The late actions in England in commissionating their fleet
to seize and fall on the Hollander, of which I wrote you in my last, breaking
their league, joining with the French, assisting them with soldiers out of
England, and with their principal harbors to receive a numerous army and
shutting up the exchequer, whereby many are outed of their estates contrary to
all law, are things that both in England and here, by men of all sorts, are
looked upon as strange, horrid, and omminous. There is another ship expected,
one Jonas Clarke, (if not stopped by the embargo or otherwise) in which one Dr.
Hoare, a minister, is expected. Remember me to mine and thine, with my love to
all with you. I cannot forgett you before the father of spirits, night and
day. The goodwill of him that dwelt in the bush be with you, cause his face to
shine upon you all, and give you peace. So prays still

Yours unfainedly to love, Peter Tillton.
This day the general court has appointed the fourth day of the week
ensueing (for themselves) a day of solemn fasting and humiliation, to fall
down upon their knees before Almighty God, for and in the behalf of his
cause, name, people and interest, that in this day are so deeply designed
against by the serpent and his seed, and that by this black cloud of tumult
and commotion now amongst the nations the Lord would bring forth the
accomplishment of those promises of his, that his people are so earnestly
lookeing after and waiteing for; allsoe they have ordered six ministers as
helps to carrye on the day, viz. Mr. Oxenbridge, Mr. Mather, Mr. Oaks, Mr.
Eliott, Mr. Whiteing, Mr. Cobbett: Further, they have ordered the 13th day of
the next month to be observed and kept as a solemn day of fast and humiliation
by all the people of this jurisdiction, on the account aforesaid.

This last fifth day was the young man that killed Mr. Daveys maid tried for
his life and condemned to dye.

I have binn ill this 2 or 3 days of an aguish feverish distemper, with
afflicting pains in my head and teeth. My dear ones, forgett not him who has
you all on his heart, and whose desire it is to leave himself and his all with
that merciful high priest who has the keys of life and death. Farewell,
farewell.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Collins to Governor Leverett of the Massachusetts.
Sir,
YOUR short letter with the treasurer's and your bills I received, which were
very welcome, having received by them the news of your hopeful recovery from
so great an illness, wherein God has spared you to that country as a public
mercy I hope as well as your friends and family, which the Lord in mercy
continue, and carry you on in your work to the perfecting of that which God in
his council has further to continue your use and services to accomplish.
According to your orders the 100 l. is paid in to Mr. Floyd upon Mr. Rawson's
account, and 64 l. 10 s. received into my own hands by virtue of the bill sent
by Mr. Saltonstall, and the new one of 44 l. 10 s. charged on Capt. Pierce,
which is in my hands, saving what has binn disbursed, according to your order,
to Mr. Rushworth, whom I have, as you directed, employed since 24th June last,
to have an eye upon your affairs, though I neglect it not myself. I agreed to
give him 3 guynies a quarter and have accordingly paid him 9 at the rates they
go, which is 20 s. a piece, and have agreed to be at all contingent charges of
fees or transcribing papers; which besides a croune or thereabout which I have
laid out is all yet out of purse; unless you shall think fit to allow any
thing toward the charges of the public papers I have formerly and now sent,
which I have hitherto paid out of my own wholly. Your letter directed to Dr.
Owen, Mr. Woodbridge and myself, we did not communicate to him, his abode
being at Newberry and seldom in town, and, betwixt you and I, we judge one
that is not very likely to be serviceable to you. You need not give any account
of it to Mr. Symons. Through Gods goodness there is not the least cause to
write to you about any thing at present that concerns you, saving that
New York being restored by the peace one Mr. Andrews is appointed governor, a
man I know not; and some rumor is maliciously spread at court that you have
made peace with the Dutch there, which is obviated by the readiness of some
persons to show the falsehood of it. I hope nothing will for this year further
disturb you, and if any thing do arise it will be from New-Yorke and the
government there, I have therefore greatly encouraged some gentlemen your
friends, who would purchase it of his royal highness, as thinking it will be
much for your peace, who are about it, but how it will issue I know not. Mr.
Rushworth has not had any thing to do for you as yet, but only to attend what
the council table or council of trade should pass, before the last of which
Plymouth patent has layn long, but nothing done in it. I hope you shall want
no information, only I hear the King is offended that some of your ships take
in their lading from Virginia and go to France and defraud his customs, as
also from other plantations; to which I know not what to say. The truth is,
proroguing the parliament is some yea much discontent to them, when they had
so many good things before them, and the present transactions in Europe, with
the kings vast debts, and their not having yet come to any resolve as to the
future way of paying of them, takes up all their thoughts that they have little
time to mind such minute things as yours, until some old things be again
revived or new provocations given, in which I doubt not God will enable you to
walk wisely. All the public news and papers most choice, as to manuscript or
print, that have come out in the time of war or parliament, I have enclosed in
a box which my brother Hammond will take up, it is shipped in Mr. Clements,
whom I have ordered to deliver them to you and pray you, after you have perused
them, to let my father have them for the use of friends; and were there any
thing considerable that is not there I should add it, saving the presaging of
men's minds of some dangers of papists and popery, and other things not fit for
papers. The 2 nations are discomposed as to the prorogueing of the parliament,
especially Scotland, where has binn sad jangling betwixt the Duke of
Lauderdale and the nobility, which may issue in disquietments. I am, I bless
God, well, with my wife, who presents you and your lady with her service, and
so are all your relations. God has binn afflicting our family here, having
taken away lately my only daughter, and also, as I hear, my relations there
have had sore breaches, the Lord sanctifye to them and me his holy hand. Since
my last it has pleased God to remove by death Mr. Lodor, Mr. Venning and some
other ministers of the presbiterian persuasion, holy men and much lamented; as
also lately Sir Thomas Temple, whom melancholy and grief has killed by his
hard usage from Mr. Elliott, but especially the occasion given of scandal by
his lodging at his old Mrs. her house, Mrs. Martin, which having heard the echo
of again from New England, from the letters that some too uncharitably wrote,
did sit deep upon his spirit and hastened his end: He sent for me and I was
with him several hours, before he dyed a week, and he laid open his soul;
it was a mere accident, yea great necessity, I judge, afterward that cast him
at that wretches house; he did declare in the presence of God, that noe
temptation, noe not in a lust after her, had ever come upon his spirit but
contrariwise a great abhorrence of it, was deeply afflicted that any had so
much aggrevated the report, and that the name of God should suffer. I saw
neither disease nor pain that would hasten his end, but his spirit broken, his
inward estate dark, wherein God did enable me to do him some small service.
I hope he had the root of the matter in him and is gone home to rest. Your
concussions you have at the college do greatly grieve me, and so much the
more that noe friend has binn pleased to give me a true state of it, but all I
gather, from them that I see, are wholly of one side; it causes a great rumor
here, and is greatly aggravated to the presidents reproach, in whom I am
concerned, for he was a member with us, but it seems has joined himself with
the 3d church at Boston, which surprizeth me, although I do judge his relation
thereby to us is erazed, all that I would say is, that it has by our New
England friends here binn laid as a reproach upon all the elders, yet I think
without cause; for if our letter be viewed you will not find that we did
recommend him to be your president, we judged that too much for us to
undertake, nor did we excite him to come or urge him upon such hopes; it was
his own eagre desire after it and his thinking that he might be serviceable
there; all we said was, that since he was prepared to come we thought him
one that might be helpful in your college work and left it with you to
judge how; if there be any other expressions, or to the like purpose of what I
mention, they are none of ours; I hope the letter is kept, and if you would do
me the favor to send me the original, or a true copy, I should return it to
you again safely, though I had rather have the original. I hope that noe
recommendation of ours will cause you to continue him, if you find him unfitt;
better he suffer than the glory of the college be mined, as is the
expression of several letters from the very best hands there. Just as I was
writing this, came to hand yours of the 12th of February 1673, wherein I have
some account of the things I am now writing about, for which I thank you, and
find your candid opinion of the Dr's actings, like to Mr. Stoughton's who gave
me much the same sentiments about the matter of fact, but did not instance in
what was charged against him. I hope God will pleas to heal that breach or to
direct you to what may be most for the good of the college; and to add noe
more of that, the kind and obliging expressions which you are pleased to use
toward me I return you my humble thanks for, and pray I may be continued in
your love and prayers as I desire to mind you in mine, though weak and sinful.
Sir, I shall only further acquaint you that Capt. Pierce required a discharge
for the whole sum, and considering the 100 l. came not into my hands, and yet
I have charged myself with it by a general acquittance to him, I think for my
discharge it is but necessary that I have, for so much paid by your order, a
discharge from your treasurer, which I beg you to remember. This is all at
present but the tender of my most humble service to you, from him who is,

Sir your most affectionate humble servant, J. C.
London April 10. 1674.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Knowles Mr. Knowles had been a Minister in
New England, but returned and settled in England.
to Governor Leverett.
London 16 April 1674. Ever honored Sir,
IT is noe little trouble to some here to understand that you are under some
indisposition of body, that you write to few friends here, the Lord strengthen
your heart and hands in that great work which the Lord has laid before you.
It is very grievous to your friends here, not only to us ministers, but your
commissioners for the college, to hear of the great breach that is made in
it, we wonder at the occasion of it, that they do not either strenthen the
hands of Mr. Hoar that so the work may go on, or else some other able man may
be put into the place. For the wound will widen by delays, and if the college
dye, the churches (some judge) will not live long after it. Mr. Penoyer's
means given to it, about forty pounds per ann. I fear will go another way
when it falls, if there be noe college; and diverse other intended gifts. We
have some money offered to be paid for the college, etc. diverse youths desire
to come over to study there, but I do give noe encouragement to them so long
as things are in such a broken condition in the college. Thus with my dear
love to yourselfe and good mistress Leverett, and Mr. Oxenbridge, I commend you
all to God's blessing in Christ Jesus.

Sir your faithful friend and servant, John Knowles.
Sir, You shall do well to send us word by your first shipp, when we have
gotten your money, what to send it over in, we think glass and nails.

Let me assure you that here is at present a great design of foot for the
regulation of New England, but you have no man here to prevent your trouble or
speak a word for you; your country ought to be at some charge here, to answer
for it, or else I clearly see you never shall be long quiet. I pray you conceal
my acquainting of yourselfe with it, the thing is true.

Sir, I should have been ashamed to scrible thus to such a one as yourselfe,
but I dare not be wanting to my duty, though my weakness at present (as to
writing) disinables me, yet through mercy otherwise well. Oh! that I could say
so of your good friends Dr. Owen, Mr. Hook, who are in a languishing
condition. I hope shortly we shall receive near an hundred pounds for the
College, though I was the first (I think) that first moved Mr. Doddridge to
give, yet I will not take it; it may be I shall accept of tenn pounds, for I
can say the getting of it now, after nine years withholding of it, has cost
me many journeys to London and some money.



Copy of a Letter from Major Thompson to Governor Leverett.
Sir,
I Understand by my cousin Peter Sergeant, who has a good quantity of powder of
mine in his hands, that the authority of your collony refused to let him sell
it, when he had good opportunitys, for my advantage, by which means its like
to prove a great lose to me. If it be so, I desire you will seriously
consider whether the collony is not to make me reparation, by taking the powder
at the rates he might have sold it. And first I must tell you, in fact, its
what his Majesty does here, for since the war our salpeter did rise
considerably to transporte, his Majesty prohibited the exportation and paid us
the same price to a farthing, reddy money, that we could have sold it for, and
has the peter still in his stores. And though particular persons must submit
to the public, yet where there is a damage the public is better able, and
in conscience ought to bear it, it being but little to each particular person
when the whole bears it, but heavy where one bears it; and if there be a
benefit, as undoubtedly it was judged, the whole did partake of it, which they
ought to do at their own charge and not at mine. Besides indeed, I think it
good pollecy to incouredg your having store in your country of that commodity,
in case of need, which the restraining the free dispose of it will hinder;
though as a lover of your country I must say it were your interest to make it
there. Sir, I appeal to you for justice and desire you will see me righted.

There has been much discourse and complaint about Mr. Gorges's pattent; it
were good if such things were taken up, least in the future they prove
prejudicial. If the country would buy out their claim it may be done, or if
you could propound how their title might answer the disburse of the money, I
should join with others or do it my self, but being wholly ignorant of the
thing have refused any discourse with the proprieters, though have binn often
invited to it. Pray let me have your thoughts about it, which will much govern
me.

Your affectionate humble servant, Rob. Thomson.

Copy of a Letter from Major Thomson to Governor Leverett.
London, this 4th June 1674. Sir,
I Formerly wrote unto you about my suffering in my powder, in which I hope you
will see me righted; since which, being at the corporation for the
propagateing the gospel amongst the Indians, I found the commissioners letter
did not incoredge the sending any stock into the country, but upon
consideration amongst themselves have at last resolved to send some, remitting
it into the hands of Mr. John Richards and Mr. Peter Sergeant, to be improved
for that work. If you please to advise with them and others, and find a way of
certain improvement by buying lands, mortgages or other security, I am
confident the corporation may be inclined to go in debt here to remitt a good
some over. And indeed if you had my apprehensions of things you would endeaver
it.

And now to return to what I began with. I am persuaded your country will
afford good peter and it would be your advantage to make powder yourselves, and
in the mean time to have a store by you, that you may not be in straights, upon
any sudden breach. I wish I may not be a prophet (as I have binn twice to some
amongst you) in this, that I fear another war. Upon which account, had I had
the freedom of the dispose of the commodity, or that the country would have
bought it now its cheap, I should have sent a large supply this year, but now
forbear untel I hear from you, and may then do it, if the doar be open. So
rests

Your affectionate servant, Rob. Thomson.

Copy of a Letter from Robert Boil, Esquire about New England, July 1674.
Sir,
WHEN you see any of the principal magistrates of N. E. you will oblige me to
take an occasion to let them know, that whereas, some months ago, I received
from several of them a letter apolegeticall, concerning answers to
misrepresentations that they feared had bin made of their affections and
actions, I had a just sense of the honor they were pleased to do me, and used
my endeavors, perhaps not altogether unsuccessfully, to have the particulars
they allege for themselves taken notice of by those two or three persons of
our court in whose good opinion it most concerns them to stand right. Though I
think that it would be much more their advantage to send or appoint some
competent person here, to solicit and manage their concerns on all emergent
occasions.

The forementioned account of my endeavors to serve them I desire should
rather be given by you than immediately by me; because, being here in a private
capacity, as their friends and mine thought it unadvisable I should show their
letter to his Majesty himself, so I thought it did not become me, in such

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Collins to Governor Leverett.
Sir,
I Hope mine with the papers I sent you are long before this time come to your
hand, wherein you will see what I have to write concerning yourselves, and
also the general state of things amongst us, glad I am I have nothing more to
add in relation to yourselves, save only that, since I wrote last, there has
been a proposition of alienating by the proprietors the province of Mayn and
what you call New-Hampshyre to the King, to make an interest of it to the Duke
of Monmouth, and it is proposed that he should send a governor to raise to
himself a revenew from it. I hope it will come to nothing. He that was all
agog to go governor thither, I had him dealt withal by a friend and such
discouragements laid before him, and the ridiculousnes of hoping for such a
revenue as was proposed of 5000 l. a year, or more, to the Duke, that I think
it is laid aside. To be sure I shall, by the last ships, to which I refer my
larger letters to you, give you a further account of that or any thing else
that shall concern you, but I judge you have little reason to expect any great
disturbance here, I suppose their own affairs are too weighty to mind yours
much, at present, and my business is so much as that if I write twice a year,
more largely, to you, you must excuse me (the emergent providence that may
signifye any thing to you I always except, to which I shall not be wanting) to
the return therefore of the last ships I shall refer a larger letter: I hope
you will see the 100 l. paid according to your order, and will understand the
agreement I have made with Mr. Rushworth for 3 guineys a quarter, with all
contingent charges, which I shall continue, though as yet there has bin noe
service done for it, but I shall follow your order, till either you remand it
or I see better reason to the contrary. I shall only add, that there may be
somewhat more considerable, as to the public, by the last return of the
ships, which I shall either by writing or prints send you; some stirs are in
Scotland about the late impositions, which what they will produce time will
show; somewhat I shall send you by the next; their parliament is desolved and
the nation in a scurvy temper; whether ours will meet again next season
appointed I know not, much depends upon it; I am now at the waters for my
health, from whence I now write. I received two short ones from you since I
last sent; to which there needs noe answer, you have found it in my former,
only I congratulate for the peoples sake rather than your own their renewed
choice of their governor, and am sorry they should in authority not yet have
their eyes opened to see the vanity and fruitlesnes of any prosecuting quakers,
or others, who are otherwise peaceable. I pray God still continue you useful,
as to making up breaches there in church and state. As to what you intimate
about the removing of the Dr. in reference to the college, I think, neither
myself or others are any further concerned than to be sorry such a breach has
binn under his hand, and to beg of God to direct you in a right choice.

I am, Your most affectionate humble servant, J. C.
July 28. 1674.
Copy of a Letter from William Goffe, one of King Charles the first's Judges,
to his Wife.
Most dear and honored Mother,
ON the 23d July I received yours of the 29th March 1674, with the enclosed
that should have come last year, hoping you have also by this time received
mine of the 21st May last, which informs you how it was then with myself and
your old friend Mr. R. Whaley.
and that I wrote largely to yourselfe and dear Mrs. Jaines, in October last,
which I perceive you have not received, which I am very sorry for; but it has
been a great mercy that all my former letters came safely to your hands, and as
for those, knowing the hazard of their miscarriage by reason of the wars, I
kept the coppyes of them, and for your further satisfaction I have again
transcribed, that you may see I was not unmindfull of my duty in writing to you
and answering your desire of my advice concerning my sister Fr. His daughter
Frances.
of whose disposal in marriage you have now given me the account, so far as
you conceive you could, and I believe are longing to understand my thoughts of
it. Dear mother, you are pleased to say well, that you gave me an account how
it has pleased the Lord to dispose of her, etc. It is indeed the Lord, who is
her heavenly father, that has disposed of her and provided this husband for
her, and therefore, tho he be unknown to me, I do believe he is the fittest
person in the world for her, and that she likewise is the most meet help for
him. I remember in a former letter to yourselfe, when you desired my thoughts
in a matter concerning her, I told you I was confident the Lord would take
care of her and in due time provide a husband for her, and now he has done it,
shall I question whether he has done it well? No, I dare not do it. It is a
great satisfaction to me that you sought the Lord, and took advise of our dear
and christian friends, and that my sister was guided in her choice by yourselfe
and them, and desire with you to bless the Lord that has provided so well for
her, and shall not cease to pray night and day on their behalf, that the Lord
will be pleased to make them great blessings to each other, and that this new
condition may be, every way and allways, comfortable to them both, for as you
very truly say, it will be as the Lord shall be pleased to make it. I pray
remember my most tender and affectionate love to them both, and tell them that
I greatly long to see them; but since that cannot be at present, you may assure
them that whilst they shall make it their great work to love the Lord Jesus in
sincerity, and love one another dearly for Christ's sake, and to carry it with
tender love and dutyfull respect to yourselfe, I shall esteem it my duty to
love and pray, and act faith for them as if they were my own children, being
not otherwise able at this distance to be helpful to them. Dear mother, that
yourselfe and all friends did so well approve the match gives much content to
my heart, and I beseech you not to give way to any recoylings that may arise in
your own spirit; do not say, as to the world, my sister might have done much
better, the Lord knows what is best for us, and ours; it may be that which we
may think would have been better might have proved much worse. These are dying
times, wherein the Lord has been and is breaking down what he has built, and
plucking up what he has planted, and therefore it is not a time to be seekeing
great things for ourselves. Let us read the 45th chap. of Jeremiah, and apply
to ourselves what the Lord there speaks to Baruch, and account it a great
mercy if he give us our lives for a prey, and bring us again to see the faces
one of another with comfort, The things, that Baruch is dehorted from seeking,
were worldly things, why then are they called great things? Surely the Lord
speaks it only according to the esteem that we are too apt to have of them,
for the worlds great things are indeed and in truth but poor little things, and
the saints should look down upon them with contempt, and show themselves to be
of high raised spirits, seeking things truly great, as our Lord himself does
exhort us, Mat. 6.33. But seek you first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness, as if he had said, for they are great things, worthy your
affectionate endeavors, and as for all these little things which gentiles so
earnestly pursue, they shall be added unto you so far as your heavenly father
knows that you have need of them. My poor sister begins her housekeeping at a
time when trading is low, and all provisions dear, and I cannot but pity her
in that respect. I hope she will not be discouraged nor her husband neither,
but for prevention I desire them to consider seriously and to act faith upon
that most excellent council our Lord delivered with authority in his sermon on
the mount, Mat. 6th from the 24th ver. to the end of the chapter. I cannot but
be full of longings to hear how the Lord has dealt with her in her lying in,
but I doubt not you will take the first opportunity to inform us of it, in the
mean time I shall endeavor to stay myself upon the promise made to
childe-bearing women, 1 Timothy 2.15.

Dear mother, I have been hitherto congratulating my newly married sister, but
I must now turn aside to drop a few tears upon the hearse of her that is
deceased, whose loss I cannot choose but lament with tears, and so share with
you in all the providence of God toward us; but my dear mother, let me not
hereby be the occasion of renewing your grief, for I doubt not but you have
grieved enough, if not too much, already. Let us consider how graciously the
Lord deals with us (as for my dear sister, she is got beyond our pity, we
need not lament for her sake, but rather rejoice that she is at rest in the
bosom of Christ) who whilst he is taking from us with one hand, gives double
with the other. He has added one to your family on whom I hope you may set
that motherly affection as if he were your own son, and I hope has before this
time also made you to rejoice in the fruit of my systers womb; and shall not we
say with Job, the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken, blessed be the name
of the Lord. But oh how apt are we to murmur, if the Lord do in any thing
displease us, but what a shame it were that we should be displeased at any
thing which God does? Who are we, that we should set our corrupt wills in
opposition to his most holy and blessed will. It is blessed counsel that a
reverend minister of the gospel gives, who had been in the school of
affliction, that I lately met with in a printed book of his, I pray you (says
he) drink in that notion, viz. That the will of God being pure, holy, perfect,
yea God himself, should not only be submitted to, or rested in, but loved and
chosen above all creatures, yea above life itself, the best of creatures.
Would we but once learn this lesson (which the Lord is, I hope, teaching of
us by all his dealings with us) and help us (as you say sweetly in your letter)
to see love in all his dispensations, there could nothing come amiss to us.

Dear mother, I perceive, when you wrote last, you were upon a remove from
those dear friends with whom you then sojourned, I hope the Lord guided you to
that motion, and shall long to hear where you settle; in the mean time, it is
my comfort that the Lord tells all your wanderings, and receives all your tears
into his bottle, and will not fail to direct all your steps, till he has
given you a safe conduct through your wearysome pilgrimage, and at the end
thereof open unto you an abundant entrance into those mansions that are
prepared for you in our fathers house, where you shall be at rest in the bosom
of Christ for ever.

Your old friend, Mr. R. is yet living, but continues in that weak condition
of which I formerly have given you account, and have not now much to add. He is
scarce capable of any rational discourse, his understanding, memory and speech
does so much fail him, and seems not to take much notice of any thing that is
either done or said, but patiently bears all things and never complains of any
thing, though I fear it is some trouble to him that he has had no letter of a
long time from his cozen Rich, but speaks not one word concerning it, nor any
thing you wrote of in your last, only, after I had read your letters to him,
being asked whether it was not a great refreshment to him to hear such a
gracious spirit breathing in your letters, he said it was none of his least
comforts, and indeed he scarce speaks any thing but in answer to questions
when they are put to him, which are not of many kinds, because he is not
capable to answer them; the common and very frequent question is to know how he
does, and his answer, for the most part, is, very well, I praise God, which he
utters with a very low and weak voice; but sometimes he says, not very well,
or very ill, and then if it be further said, do you feel any pain any where,
to than he allwaies answers, no; when he wants any thing he cannot well
speak for it, because he forgets the name of it, and sometimes asks for one
thing when he means another, so that his eye or his finger is oftentimes a
better interpreter of his mind than his tongue; but his ordinary wants are so
well known to us, that most of them are supplied without asking or making
signs for them, and some help he stands in need of in every thing to which any
motion is required, having not been able, of a long time, to dress or undresse
himself, nor to feed, or ease nature either way, orderly, without help, and
its a great mercy to him that he has a friend that takes pleasure in being
helpful to him, and I bless the Lord that gives me such a good measure of
health and strength, and an opportunity and a heart to use it in so good and
necessary a work; for though my help be but poor and weak, yet that ancient
servant of Christ could not well subsist without it, and I do believe, as you
are pleased to say very well, that I do enjoy the more health for his sake. I
have sometimes wondered much at this dispensation of the Lord toward him, and
have some expectations of more than ordinary issue; the Lord help us to profit
by all, and to wait with patience upon him, till we shall see what end he will
make with us. Thus far I write of myself, I shall now ask him what he would
have me to say to his friends concerning him. The question being asked, he
says, I am better than I was. And being asked what I should say more to his
cozen R. or any other friends, after a long pauze, he again said, the Lord
has visitted me in much mercy, and has answered his visitation upon me. (I
give it you in his own words.) Being desirous to draw more from him, I proposed
several questions and the sum of his answers were, that he earnestly desires
the continuance of the fervent prayers of all his friends for him, and desires
to be remembered to his cozen Rich and longs to receive a letter from her, and
desires her to exhort her son and daughters, his dear cozens, to fear God, and
to be remembered to her aunt at Chelsey, praying that the Lord will requite all
her great love, as also to be remembered to Mrs. Jaines and her good husband, to
whom also he thinks himself greatly obliged for their great love, and in
particular for Mrs. Jaines her care of poor Nol. desiring her to continue the
same; as also to be remembered to yourselfe, and wishes Frank much comfort in
her new condition, and says he shall not cease to pray for you and all yours.
This is written on the 6th of August, but I know not when I shall have
opportunity to send to Boston, it may be therefore before I send away my letter
I may have something more to add concerning him.

Thus far I proceeded yesterday, but night coming on and having something else
to do, I could proceed no further, and so laid aside my paper, intending this
morning to finish (if the Lord pleased) my answer to yours of the 29th March.
But now my first work must be to tell you that, through the great goodness of
God, I did also last night, after supper, receive your welcome letter of the
8th of May (Franks birthday) wherein you let me know that you have also
received mine of the 2d of October last, at such a season, which made it the
more refreshing to you, which is a great satisfaction and comfort to me, for
which I desire to bless the Lord; but it would have been the more full if you
had but said, with the enclosed to dear Mrs. Jaines, which I have lately
transcribed, together with your own, from the originalls, with a purpose to
have sent them with this, but I shall send neither, for I have good hopes that
both were received, for I cannot but think when you complained that the door of
your house was opened, if half of your goods had been taken away you would
have made mention of it; for your own letter was both the house and inventorie
of all the goods contained in it.

Dear Mother, it is also a great comfort to me to hear that the Lord was
graciously pleased to appear on my dear systers behalf in the needful hour,
and desire with you to bless the Lord for that great mercy, and I heartily
thank you for giving me so quick a notice of it. Dear mother, it was likewise
a great mercy that the Lord was pleased so far to satisfy your desire as to
show you the fruit of her womb and to make you the joyful grandmother of a
son, and though it has pleased the Lord so soon to transplant him from the
militant to the triumphant church, yet it may be a great comfort to yourselfe
and my dear sister, that from your wombs has proceeded the increase to the
mystical body of Jesus Christ, and reckon it a mercy that the Lord being
purposed to take him from you in his infancy, was pleased (that it might be the
more easy to you) to do it before it had much time to take deep root in your
affections, for I do believe the longer yourselves and his other relations had
enjoyed him the harder it would have been to us all to have parted with him:
But what shall we say more? It may be such considerations as these are too
selfish, it is enough to compose the hearts of the children of God under every
providence, to say, it is the Lord that has done it, our loving and tender
hearted infinitely wise Father has declared his royal pleasure, and it is our
duty to submit to it, yea to rejoice in it (for it is most meet he should
dispose of us and ours as shall seem good in his sight) and to apply ourselves
to learn the lessons he would teach us thereby, and among the rest that is none
of the least which you mention, to get our hearts weaned from creature comforts
and to live upon himself as our allsufficient soul satisfying portion; and let
my dear brother and sister remember what the H. G. says, Lam. 3.27. It is good
for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. Dear mother, I pray, in your
next, speak a little more fully concerning his godliness, for you say nothing
to that, except by the phraise of a very honest man, you mean a very godly man,
as I hope you do; for you give the same epethite to that good man (whose word
you took concerning him) of whom another friend says that he is a very godly
man, aged and wise, etc. I pray, remember my dear love to sister Judeth, and
tell her from me she must now be a very good child, and labor to know the God
of her father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, 1
Chr. 18.9. and leaving to grieve for her sister and nephew that are at rest
with God, strive with all her might to be a comfort to her poor afflicted
mother, who is contesting with the difficulties and temptations of an evil
world. I humbly thank you for your motherly love and care for me, in your
being so desirous to supply my wants; and because you are pleased to lay your
commands upon me, I shall make bold, when I need your help in that kind, to
write to you for it. There is yet a little meal in the barrel and oil in the
cruise. The greatest thing I need is a heart to abide patiently in this
condition until it be expended. I cannot but account it a great mercy that in
these hard times you should be able to be so helpful to your poor children;
but I beseech you let not your love to them make you to forget yourselfe, in
parting with what is necessary for your own comfort in your old age. Dear
mother, you say you find nature greatly decaying in you, and therefore desire
prayers that grace may be strengthened, etc. It cannot be otherwise expected
but that as age comes on nature will decay; but I beseech you preserve it what
you can, and take heed of immoderate griefs, or whatsoever else may be
prejudicial to your health, which you are able ta avoyde, and when you have
done all you can, if you still perceive the outward man perishing, yet faint
not, for I do believe, through the faithfulness of God, your inward man shall
be renewed day by day, 2 Cor. 4.16. I bless the Lord, though I cannot deny but I
feel, with you, the decays of nature, yet I have and do enjoy a competent
measure of health and strength, and beg your pardon if I have been too slow in
acquainting you with and giving you the comfort of it. I thank you for what
you have written concerning those relations I desired to hear of; and the
rather because you say you cannot write much, through the weakness of your
eyes, and I fear it may hurt them to read these long letters, for I desire you
first to read and then seal and deliver the enclosed to my honored and dear
friend D. G. with my best respects to him and his dear wife. My dear mother, I
recommend to you the counsel and promise given to the Philipians, chap. 4. 4,
5, 6, 7. and let me entreat you to rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say
rejoice; and I beseech you remember that weak eyes are made weaker by too much
weeping. Pray take heed you do not hurt yourselfe thereby.

But alas I see my paper is almost done and I must yet reserve a little rome
for a postscript, therefore (hoping I have not forgotten any material thing I
should write of) I am forced here to break off abruptly, and with my most
affectionate remembrances to all friends as if I named them, desiring the
continuance of your and their fervent prayers, I recommend you and my dear
brother and sisters to the tender watchful care of him who has borne us from
the belly and carried us from the womb, and will be our God and guide unto
death. I am, dear mother,

Your most affectionate and dutiful son, W. G.
Now, my dear mother, give me leave in a postscript to be a little merry with
you, and yet serious too. There is one word in one of your letters that sounds
so harshly, and looks so untowardly, that I cannot tell well how to read or
look upon it, and I know not how to write it, and yet I must, though I cross
it out again. I suppose you do by this time sufficiently wonder what will
follow; but the matter is this, after you had given me a loving account of a
business wherein you have done your best, you were pleased to say, that if I
should be angry you had many to bear with you, etc. Rash anger, I confess, is
a burden that needs more shoulders than one to bear it; for Solomon says, a
stone is heavy and the sand weighty, but a fools wrath is heavier than them
both. But oh, my dear mother, how could you fear such a thing from me?
Yourselfe knows I never yet spoke an angry word to you, nay I hope I may say
(without taking the name of God in vain) the Lord knows I never conceived an
angry thought toward you, nor do I now, nor I hope never shall, and in so
saying I do not commend myself, for you never gave me the least cause, neither
have you now, and I believe never will; therefore, dear mother, the whole
praise belongs to yourselfe, or rather to the Lord, who, blessed be his name,
has so united our hearts together in love that it is a thing scarce possible
to be angry one with another. But I shall now conclude with a request that you
will not be angry with yourselfe for writing that word I have spoken so much
against, for I suppose all your meaning was, if I should not altogether
approve of what was done, etc. and I am abundantly satisfied that the root from
which that fear sprung was tender love, and that you speak your heart when
you say you love and honor me as much as ever, which may well increase my
longings after you, for the exceeding grace of God in you. Now thanks be unto
God for his unspeakeable gift. 2 Cor. 9.14, 15. The remarkable circumstances of
two persons who had made so considerable a figure in England will, I hope,
excuse the publication of this long letter, although it has no immediate relation
to the affairs of the Massachusetts colony.




Copy of a Letter from Major Thomson to Governor Leverett.
Sir,
I Formerly wrote you concerning some dissatisfaction that there was in some
great ministers of state as to your country, in that some did defraud the king
of his customs in carrying tobacco, etc. to other parts, which by law ought to
be brought to England. I know this is don by particular persons, and possibly
unknown to the government. Yet how to excuse it here I know not, though as I
have opportunity have not bin wanting to plead the countries excuse, and lay it
where it ought to be laid; and withal to give you my advise, that it will be
abundantly your interest to be diligent to prevent the like for the future, and
if any do slipp your hands to be the informer of it yourselves. There are two
of your vessels I hear gone for Holland with tobacco.

Your affectionate servant, Rob. Thomson.
3d August 74.
Copy of a Letter from Governor Leverett to Mr. John Collins.
Sir,
YOURS of the 10th April is before me and thereby understand as by Capt. Pierce
of the money that was in his hand is paid according to order, also of your
engaging Mr. Rushworth in our busynes and for your disburse to him, and those
papers you send us and all other your charges is expected that you place to
account, and not to put you to the charge; your time and endeavors for us is
more than is meet we should expect from you, and I hope we shall be able in
time to go beyond, but in the mean time please to accept of the
acknowledgment of your true friends, which on their behalf as my own I hereby
freely give you. For your providentially being restrained from communicating
ours to Mr. B. I am well pleased with, and shall make use thereof according to
your information. I heartily desire you to present my service to the reverend
my honored friend though unknown to him D. J. O. whom I have cause to
acknowledge, having had through the mercy of the Lord tastes of his goodness in
attending upon him in his ordenances, by his administration, and otherways by
his prints. Your testimony of Sir Thomas Temple, a little before his exitt,
allays the reports by others raised, I hope falsely. For the business of the
college with us we have cause to be humbled, that through animosityes we
should cause discouragement to those at so great distance that wish us well,
that they are hindered in their freedom in the forwarding of that work, I must
freely say it to you I see not the reason, but that a perverse spirit seems to
be our judgment. The Lord humble us in the sense of it; yet I hope we are
groweing over it. Thy Doctor's Doctor Hoar the President of the College.
opposers loose ground, and I hope the work will yet be carried an end. The
not effecting the disappointment of the last commencement, and the Lord's
helping the Doctor in that act to pass with general acceptance gives some hopes
that he may get over the check given him in his beginning, which may make him
more cautious for time to come; who is, I doubt, nor so cautious in his comeing
off from former engagement as he ought before he enters upon new; his not
concerneing you in his relateing himself in church fellowship here, I cannot
look at as independently congregationall, I mean in a good sense, I have not
had opportunity to speak to him, but intend it; he has lately had an ague and
since a flux, but in a hopeful way of recovery. Mr. Oaks Minister of
Cambridge, afterward President of the College.
has had a distemper hang upon him that has much weakened him; the greatest
occasion, I think, is some exercise in his mind, though he thinks it is the
remain of his sickness long ago in England. I have been afraid least he may
be of noe long continuance with us; but a grain of hopes that he may get over
it. The Lord has been graciously pleased to favor us in the seasons of the
year for the fruits of the earth, blessed be his name. Our neighbors the
Dutch have been very neighbourly since they had certain intelligence of the
peace. One of their captains have bin upon the French sorts, taken Penobscot,
with loss of men on both sides; what they have done further east we understand
not. Your brother Moody has been lately here with us, a very sorrowful
widdower by the death of his wife your sister, so the Lord has been pleased to
bereave your good father and mother of their daughter, who are helped to carry
it like old disciples in the schole of Christ. I am at present in good health,
but often exercised with pains of stone in the kidnyes. I have voided twoe in
six months, and if there should be a proportionable growth for others, as
between the twoe last, my time to continue, I must need account to be short,
little sand being to run in my glass. I desire that the numbering of my days
may be so as that I may have my heart applied to wisdom, and that I may wait
all the days of my appointed time until my change come, and I be found in him
who is unchangeable. I desire to sympathize with you and Mrs. Collins in your
bereavements. Myself and wife remember our due respects to you both, beg the
continuance of your prayers, commend you to God, and remain,

Sir, Your truly affectionate humble servant, J. L.
August 24. 74.
Copy of a Letter from Governor Leverett to Major Thompson.
Boston, this 24 August 1674. Sir,
BY yours of the 27 April 74, you give me to understand that you have
information from Mr. Peter Sergeant that the authority of the Massachusetts
prohibited him from selling of your powder in his hand, and from thence claim
justice by the taking off the powder at the price he could have sold it; I
shall not need but refer you to Mr. Sergeant, by whom these come, for the
giveing you a more right understanding of what he wrote, for I assure you never
any order past for the restraynning of him or any other to make sale of that or
any other sort of goods, but the contrary, since upon the war, an order past
that the storekeeper should not deliver any but by order from some magistrates;
nor will Mr. Sergeant say that ever he had any denial upon any desire for the
delivery of powder sold by him; there was one bound for Guyny, that had bought
of him twenty barrels and clandestinely, contrary to law, shipped it, so that
it was seizable by a law in force when you was in these parts; which powder,
upon his petition, was set at liberty, and he allowed to ship off ten barrels,
the other he privetly conveyed, so that he carried all away. At the same time
the order before mentioned was given to the storekeeper, there was an order
issued for the several towns to have their stores fully supplied according to
law, which quickened the demand of powder within ourselves; and the other
collonyes understanding the order applied themselves for liberty to recruite
their stores, which was redily granted them, so that the order past by
authority was noe obstruction but a furtherance to those that had of that
commodity, both for quicknes of sale and advance of price, and this I hope is
sufficient to rectify your thoughts in that matter.

Sir, For the business of Mr. Gorges pattent, which was granted, as by the date
appears, after the Massachusetts, so that the jurisdiction lies within the
government thereof is without question here; that there has been several
turns therein is very true; but that there has been any just cause of
complaint of the government of the Massachusetts, I am persuaded that if the
whole matter wear prepared noe indifferent judges would blame them for what
has been done by them; yet, could there be a way hit upon to stop clamours it
would be a service to them. I am confident, and that upon good and rational
grounds, had Mr. Gorges what he desires from the Massachusetts he would not find
the place turn to his profitt, but rather an addition to former loss; and
should any purchase his pretentions, in expectation of profitt, they would miss
in their expectation; yet, could the business be took up with him, it might be
a service to this government, in preventing clamours. In order thereto, and you
please to treat with them concerned, that thereby you may understand what they
claim and the grounds thereof, and what proposal they will make, and give
notice thereof, you should receive answer thereto; or might his pretentions be
bought off for five hundred pounds, and assurance given to take off all after
claims and claimers against the collony of the Massachusetts or others upon the
place, and you please to engage in it for the collony, I do hereby oblige that
the money shall be ordered to be paid there, upon such assurance given.
Concerning which I may not question but that you will do it by such advice as
may be had, that it may stand good in law, and for that, possibly, you may meet
with an opportunity that for present money more may be effected than by taking
time, if you please to disburse it to the sum forementioned, I do pass my word
that you shall be imbursed your money, with consideration for the same. I
should not have made thus bold with you in this matter, but from your loveing
encouragement given by yours to me, and the confidence I have of that loveing
respect you have to the peace and welfare of this place, and the churches of
our Lord Jesus therein; desiring that what I have wrote in this matter may be
for your use and noe thing therein may be imparted to any that may seek
occasion against the government thereby.

By yours of the 4th June, which came first to hand (the other not coming to my
hand until the 18th instant, Mr. Sergeant can give the reason) I perceive your
mind is laboring for the public good, your informations thereto I heartily
thank you for, and shall in any thing to my power promote, for the Indian
affair with the commissioners or the other gentlemen. We are upon a work for
making powder and have erected a mill in order thereunto at Neponset, about 6
miles from Boston; our difficulty will be for peter, which we must, in our
beginning, have from without us, but hope, in time, may raise it amongst us. We
have an aincient man that came out of Kent, one Walter Everden, that made
powder in England, as he says, is employed in the work; and for your having
liberty to ship off from hence, in case you have store with us, you shall not
need to doubt it, or if a stay be made for the countries use, but that they
will make pay for the same. You may assure yourself that we see it for the
public service to encourage trade, and I hope we shall not be left to strike
in with others, that labor what in them lies to put clogs and discouragement
upon the trade that the Lord has led us into, beyond expectation in our
beginnings; and you will be informed by Mr. Sergeant that the discouragement
that was laid before you was upon groundless misprision and not from any thing
done by authority to occasion it; so commending you to God, I rest,

Sir, your affectionate servent. J. L.

Copy of a Letter from Governor Leverett to Major Thomson.
Sir,
YOURS of 3d August 74, came to my hand 26th 7ber. By Mr. Sargeant I wrote in
answer to yours respecting powder and Mr. Gorges's business. For the
dissatisfaction you mention, in reference to vessels belonging to this place
that go freighted with tobacco, I do not understand of any but one that went
from our parts this year, mostly as it is said with logwood, and by charter
directly bound for England, and the owners took bond for their ships value
that noe damage should acrue to them by the freighters neglect of paying the
king his duties. His name is Mr. Dervall. a Dutchman that came from New York,
he married Mr. Delevall's daughter. If any of our vessels went, they went from
Virginia, touch in England and put off part of their tobacco there, as I am
informed. I suppose the provision made of paying the king's duty in Virginia
will take off occasion of complaint for time to come; for myself I am not
concerned therein, the general court having left the care of that affair with
the secretary, only shall advertise him to more circumspection in his place. I
acknowledge that we are much obliged to you for your love in so friendly
advising. The continuance of which favors, as it will be a service to God, so
desired by him who commending you to the Lord and giving you his best respects,
remains, Sir,

Your humble Servant, J. L.
Boston, 29. 7. 74.
Copy of a Letter from Major Thomson to Governor Leverett.
London this 16 Feb. 1674. Sir,
BY yours of the 24th of August I perseave you judge my complaint about the
powder was groundless: The reason you give me. For my applying to you, it was
upon my cousin Sergeants informing me, as I then wrote, which he still affirms,
and though he is loath to offend the government in saying any thing now that he
thinks may not be acceptable, I think your own excuse, if weyed, says
enough for me; for when 20 barrels ware sold there was a great trouble to git
a license for 10, and the other ten privately carried away, which certainly
hindered others from endeavoring to buy any to send abroad, and that voyage, I
know, might well have carried to advantage ten times that quantity: And I
assure you, let the law be as aintient as it will, I will never (if I can help
it) have my estate under such a restraint, and had I known it would never have
had a barrel in your collony. Yet the oldness of the law takes not off the
equity against the new law to compel all into one storehouse, under your
storekeeper, and that he should deliver none but by the magestrates order;
which is prejudicial to its sail; for trade is a seacret thing, and when
made public in the perticulers proves injurious to the concerned, but where
such supervisers will make it otherwise, and so, upon the whole, I am not
satisfied, but my first demand is grounded upon reason, and so expect you
should do me justice. The case of peter I instanced in houlds good, for it was
restrained by a law made before ours was imported, and yet his Majesty took
ours off at the rate it would have yielded, which is what you ought to do for
my powder. I am also much dissatisfied with my cousin Sergeants great charge of
storehouse rome, 32 s. per ton a year. It was a prudent case to have powder at
a distance from the town, as here in the tower, but let the quantity be never
so great that we lodge there, nothing is paid for it; so if you had laid it
upon the countries charge, or at least a reasonable warehouse rome, it might
have bin excused, but because a private person, for a barrel or two, is
willing, therefore to injoine for quantities, I think is not equal (though a
factor may consent) which also I leave with you for justice.

For the business of Mr. Gorge I should willingly have disburst the money you
mention, but they are now in the clouds and expect as much a year, secured
here, for their interest; the copy of his, with others their petition, I gave
Mr. Collins to send you, and is hear enclosed. The council of trade have don
nothing, so its remanded to his Majesty's prevy council. As any thing passes
(so far as I can learn) shall advise you, but am of opinion that some
presents might be plaste to the countries advantage, and yet of noe great vallue.

As to what you write of the 26th of September, I am glad I could say so much
to some of his Majesty's officers, yet I must inform you that the paying the
custom in Virgina does not priveledg any vessel to carry tobacco to any place
but to the English plantations, and the governor of the plantation where such
tobacco is brought, if it be again exported, is bound to take bond to bring it
for England. I should be sorry that his Majesty should have any ground of
offense in this kind, for a little profitt to some particular persons, to be an
occasion of depriveing the whole of their chiefest enjoyments. Its objected
here by some that you have noe such law there, and so will not judge by our
laws in exporting or importing of goods to or from foreign kingdoms. If it
be so, as a true friend to you, I would advise it be one of the first things
you do to prevent greater evils, which is all the trouble that at present is
given you by your affectionate and faithful servant.

Rob. Thomson.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Collins to Governor Leverett.
Sir,
YOURS by Mr. Sprague I received and desire to bless God for the tidings it
brings of your health and your familye, and to be suitably affected with all
other providential alterations the holy and wise God has brought amongst you,
wherein I humbly beg that poor country may hear the voice of the rod and who
has appointed it. I shall take things in order as I find them in your letter,
that I may not omit to answer all that is needful. For Dr. Hoares concern as
to the college, I am very sorry that matters are so ill that nothing can heal
that breach but his laying down, and more that he should put the overseers to
the utmost waiting for it, which I think very little prudence in him; by
comparing report with report, letter with letter, I am almost confounded in
making a judgment of this matter; some so severe as to lay all the blame on
him and that not only of unmeetness for the place but several moral
miscarriages; others again wholly in charging one Mr. Graves and others of the
fellows, and adding the emulation of several expecting the preferment;
yourselfe, with others most judicious, parting it betwixt both. I choose the
medium to judge by; only methinks a passage in your letter, more direct against
him than any thing formerly, does a little startle me, at least so far as to
beg, in your next, a true account of it, namely his want of truth in his words.
Pray Sir, if you judge him justly culpable in that matter, let me privately
know it, for he is a member with us, if he return. The enclosed copy of the
letter is, as far as I remember, just as we wrote it. My only concern in this
business is to sympathize with the broken state of that once flourishing house,
to beg of God a revival of the work and all else in which his glory is
concerned in the midst of the years, and to mourn over that disunited spirit
amongst Gods people which appears in this matter and all others; and what
tokens of Gods displeasure are but too evident with you; the Lord humble his
people, pardon and heal the land. For the business of Mr. Dyers petition I know
nothing of that in particular but, as I hope God has sent in Mr. Foster, you
will, by my letters, understand the same thing, in effect, which now I am able
to give you an account of, as far as yet the affair has gone. The enclosed
petition will show you what they are about to put the King upon, a purchase of
the propriety of the province of Main and Hampshire, and by whom transacted;
he that the King should buy it for is the Duke of Monmouth, though nothing as
yet is determined; many complaints are made against you; they have thoughts of
sending a commissioner thither, and it was determined to do it with some force,
but their more weighty affairs and want of money will hardly admit this, I
suppose, this summer; but a letter from his Majesty you will have, to order
some account of these things to be given him, and I fear that which is aimed
at is to call your patent to a strict account, upon what terms you hold it;
you would do well to be in a preparation for it, especially to make good your
title to that part of your government. Here is none able to speak for you, we
want instructions, papers that we had formerly the late dreadful fire either
consumed or removes have quite lost. My Lord Privy Seal, who was formerly wrote
to and engaged on your behalf, lately sent for me, with whom I had discourse
about an hour, who was as free as he thought good with me in this affair, and
beyond his own will I could not nor durst urge. I perceve he takes it ill (my
Lord Anglesea, who is Lord Privy Seal) that he has not been addressed to,
Hist. Massa. Bay, Vol. I. p 3^9.
and the matter lies before him. I begged him you might not be prejudged
beforehand, which he promised me. He told me the King would write to you. I
think, if with the first you wrote an obliging letter to him and transmit your
pleas to him as well as others that may wayt upon him, you will do well. Your
moneys in my hands will not, as things go with us, stop any gap, by way of
present; if the 100 l. you drew off by Mr. Rawson had bin left with your order
in my hands to have bestowed it, with good advice, where it might have been
placed, it would have entangled for a long time, and perhaps everted the
busenes. Mr. Rushworth has bin in salary ever since your order, at 3 guyneys a
quarter, nor is that all paid, so that with contingent charges, which are not
much, there will be near 20 l. gone, when he is paid, yet is not all he has
done worth a rush; if my own industry, with the help of Major Thomson, had not
sifted this business, about which I have taken many a step, he had not had the
least crevise of light into this business; all he has and what now he
prosecutes is upon my information; he is old and full of business, and has but
small interest at court: I intend, upon my own head, to pay him to lady day
and then withold, and I think, if you would order, by the first, all the money
remayneing into Major Thomsons hands, he would make a better use of it for
your advantage, his employment in the East India company gives him frequent
access to court, where he has opportunity to give a feeling to such clerks
of the council as may serve you with true intelligence, which I cannot do in
my circumstances, having not bin at Whitehall but twice in many years; and
persecution is pretty hot, and if it goes on I may expect a prison for my
living in the town, and therefore I judge, on all accounts, he is the fittest
person, who if you oblidge in it may do you most service. I have not nor shall
acquaint him with what I write to you, because I would leave you free to your
own judgment, only I pray let me have a dischardge of what I have disbursed
that I may receive my quietus est out of the exchequer, the full and just sum
of which you shall have by the next ships. As to what you write of the removal
of more of Gods servants in the ministry, and especially Mr. Oxenbridge,
lately, I do bemoan it, the Lord of the harvest send forth more laborers into
it. As to any private hints you give about myself what they will amount to I
cannot judge till I see how providence works, and then, I fear, my resolution
will not be equal to what may be desired, how willing soever I may be, which
if I were free I should deeply ponder; I doubt the church here will as soon all
remove to you as myself; but here is too much of an affair that I know not
whether I shall be any further concerned in than to tender my humble thanks
to you for that undeserved love and respect you have showed in your desires to
have me so near to you. As for our affairs here, I have nothing to write, but
I shall transmit in the public prints, save only that the King, by the
prevalency of the bishops over him, has within this month or 6 weeks taken off
the protection of his licenses given us in March 72 and, together with a hot
prosecution of the Papists, left us also a very troublesome persecution,
wherein many are spoiled of their goods, several imprisoned, which last cost
the life of a worthy minister, Mr. Thompson of Bristol, pastor of the church
there; several returned upon 20 s. a month into the exchequer, to their utter
undoing; this city yet scapes best, you cannot imagine how averse the spirit of
the magestrates is to meddle with us; what importunity and opportunity may at
last produce we are fearful. The parliament meets April 13. how they will back
these things or check them we desire to wayt with prayer and faith; all things
here threaten a storm a coming upon us. All we desire, if God keep us
faithful to himself, he will deliver us from sin, the greatest evil, and we
shall hope the wrath of man shall praise him and the remaynder he will
restrain. Things in the parts beyond sea look still as proceeding to further
war and confusion; Hollands condition yet distracted, the protestants every
where sufferers, and yet the popish swords drawn one against another. Methinks
the coming of our Lord should be near, in the faith of which we desire to
wayt. The parliament will one way or other give a great change to things and
make me have more news to send (which I shall communicate as opportunity
serves) though I expect none good.

Sir, my father in his, by this conveyance, has acquainted me how bountiful a
patron you have bin to my brother Samuel, which I durst not omit my owning of
to you with the return of my humble thanks, begging of the Lord that he
would require it 7 fold into the bosom of yourselfe and yours, and shall take
myself oblidged to express my real thankfulness in all ways of service and
affection, as far as I am capable. Your relations are all well and so is my
family, through Gods goodness. The Lord, even himself, be your councellor,
your strength, your rock, your strong habitation, to whom you may continually
resort, and anoint you with his spirit, for the shields of the earth belong
unto him, and cause your bow to abide in strength, that you may remain unmoved
against all opposition and glorify God in your place and finish your course
with joy. My wife and self present our humble service to you and your lady,
and desire to make mention of you always in our prayers, begging the same for

Sir, Your most affectionate oblidged servant, J. C.

Copy of a Letter from Sir Edmund Andross to the Governor and Council of the
Massachusetts.
Gentlemen,
HAVING allways endeavored not to be wanting in all neighbourly and friendly
manner to your colony, this is on occasion of a printed paper set forth in your
names the 7th December last past of your Indyan war, wherein, besides, is
declared that Philip and his whole crew, in his retreat toward Conecticut
river, recruiting himself with ammunition from Albany, has prosecuted his
first design to ruin and destroy the English, etc. The which being a severer
imputation then could have been brought from enemies, without complaint or
notice, much less from his Majesty's subjects, without any known cause and
some in your parts convicted and fined, but no mention thereof. And having,
unasked, acted as is known, and published through this government such severe
orders concerning Indyans, as appears on record, and particularly at Albany for
sale of ammunition, to the forfeiting of estate and life, I do therefore
hereby desire you will let me know by the bearer, what persons at Albany are
guilty, that they may be proceeded against accordingly, or that exemplary
punishment be inflicted on the notorious impostors, to the vindication of the
magistrates and all other his Majesty's good subjects under his royal
highnesses government in these parts, who allways have endeavored and duly
observe all his Majesty's laws. Which expecting, I remain,

Gentlemen, Your neighbor and friend, Andross.
New-Yorke, Jan. 24. 1675,
Copy of a Paper endorsed Mr. E. R's. Narrative Sept. 20th and Octo. 12th 1676.
To the right honorable the Lords of his Majesty's most honorable Privy Council
appointed a committee for trade and plantations.
An answer to several heads of enquiry concerning the present state of
New England.
AND whereas amongst the several colonies and plantations settled there that
of the Massachusetts bay, commonly called the corporation of Boston, is the most
flourishing and powerful, and at the present gives laws to a great part of
this country, by a pretended charter from his late Majesty, it is first in
relation to this colony most humbly answered. To the first enquiry.

Where the legislative and executive powers of the government of New England
are seated.
The legislative power is seated in a general court, from which there is no
appeal, consisting at present of a governor, deputy governor and 10
magistrates, with the deputies of the several towns in that jurisdiction, all
which are yearly elected.

This court is the supreme judicature of the colony, and only has power to
make laws, raise money, and lay taxes upon the whole colony, dispose lands,
give and confirm properties, impeach, sentence and pardon, and receave appeals
from all inferior courts, and cannot be adjourned or dissolved without the
consent of the major part.

The governor, deputy governor and magistrates are chosen by the majority of
the votes of the freemen of the colony, who are to attend at Boston, either in
person or by proxy, without any summons, the last Wednesday in Easter term,
and upon that day to consummate the election, which is done by writing the
names in paper, but no person that has been a magistrate the year before is to
be left out Left out of the nomination he intends.
at the new election, and is to have the precedence in nomination before all
others.

The deputies for the general court are chosen by the freemen of every town,
who have all the power of the freemen transferred to them. No town can send
more than two deputies, and where a town has but 20 freemen, that town can
send but one deputy, and when not 10 freemen the town sends none; no person
being an attorney is to be chosen a deputy.

No person is admitted to be a freeman of the colony, or have vote in any
election but church members who are in full communion and approved by the
general court.

The governor and magistrates sit apart and act all business by themselves, by
drawing up bills and orders, which having agreed upon, they send to the
deputies to be considered, and accordingly to give their consent or dissent
thereunto.

The deputies likewise sit by themselves and consult about such matters as they
shall find meet for the common good, which being agreed on they present to the
magistrates to be considered, who may give their consent or dissent.

No law is made without the consent of the major part of the magistrates and
the greater number of the deputies. The governor has a casting vote in all
courts and assembles, can call a general court, or any other court or council
at his pleasure.

The executive power is in the governor and council, whereof seven men make a
quorum, the governor or deputy governor to be one. But when business is urgent
then the acts of so many as do assemble are accounted valid and sufficient, and
can impresse soldiers, seamen, ships, all manner of ammunition and provision,
and all other necessaries, and give warrant to the treasurer to make payment
for the same.

The council sits twice a week constantly, and is summoned at the pleasure of
the governor, and oftener if need be.

There be two courts of assistants yearly kept at Boston by the governor,
deputy governor and the rest of the magistrates, upon the first Tuesday in
March and September, to hear and determine all actions of appeal from inferior
courts, and all capital and criminal causes extending to life, member or
banishment.

There are also county courts held in several towns of the colony upon set
days by such magistrates as the general court shall appoint, for to hear and
determine all causes civil and criminal, not extending to life, member or
banishment. To make and constitute needful officers, and to summon juries of
inquest, time of holding said courts always on Tuesdays.

The governor and deputy governor jointly agreeing, or any 3 magistrates
consenting, have power to reprieve a condemned person till the next general
court.

Every magistrate is a justice of the peace, and can determine any cause under
40 s. can commit to prison and punish offenders for breach of laws and impose
fines according to discretion.

The secretary of the council signs all warrants for the execution of
persons, sitting the general court or court of assistants.

The governor and magistrates at all courts, meetings and assemblies, have a
public table kept and their necessary expenses born at the charge of the
country.

And for keeping all persons in perfect obedience to their authority, it is
enacted, that whosoever shall revile the person of any magistrate or minister,
or shall defame any court of justice or the sentence or proceedings of the
same, or the judges of any such court in respect of any act or sentence therein
passed, shall be punished by whipping, fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement or
banishment, as the quality or measure of the offense shall deserve.

And whosoever shall conspire and attempt any invasion, insurrection, or
public rebellion against the commonwealth, or shall endeavor to surprise any
town or fort, or shall treacherously and perfidiously attempt the alteration
and subversion of the frame of policy or government fundamental he shall be
put to death.

And as a mark of sovereignty they coin money stamped with inscription
Mattachusets and a tree in the center, on the one side, and New England, with
the year 1652 and the value of the piece, on the reverse. Their money is of the
standard of England for finenesse, the shillings weigh three pennyweight troy,
in value of English money nine-pence farthing, and the smaller coins
proportionable. These are the current moneys of the colony and not to be
transported thence, except twenty shillings for necessary expenses, on penalty
of confiscation of the whole visible estate of the transporters.

All the money is stamped with these figures, 1652, that year being the era of
the commonwealth, wherein they erected themselves into a free state, enlarged
their dominions, subjected the adjacent colonies under their obedience, and
summoned deputies to sit in the general court, which year is still
commemorated on their coin. This is a misrepresentation. The first money of
this impress being stamped in 1652 they never altered the date, although they
stamped more annually for thirty years together.


All commissions are made in the name of the governor, with the consent of the
council, but all passes for ships and certificates are in the name of the
governor only, in these forms.

Commission.
John Leverett, Esquire Governor of the Massachusetts jurisdiction in N. E. with
consent of the council.
To A. B. Captain.
WHEREAS you are chosen and appointed to be captain to a foot company under the
command of C. D. general and commander of the forces now to be sent forth in
the expedition against the treacherous barbarous enemies: These are therefore
to will and require you to take care and charge of the said company as their
captain and diligently to attend the same charge of exercising the inferior
officers and soldiers, and with your best skill and endeavor to pursue, kill
and destroy the said enemy, commanding your company to obey you as their
captain for the service of the country; and you to observe and obey all such
orders and directions as from time to time you shall receave from your
superior officers, the general, the council, or general court of the
Massachusetts jurisdiction in New England. At Boston, 13th June 1676.

Sealed with the seal of the colony.

Pass.
To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.
I John Leverett, Esquire governor of his Majesty's colony of the Massachusetts in
New England, do testify and make known that J. W. master or commander of the
Sarah frigate has appeared before me and delared by solemn oath that the said
ship or vessel of which he is at present master or commander, containing about
one hundred tons, does belong to the inhabitants of the city of London, within
the dominions of his most serene and mighty prince the King of England,
Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of the faith. So help him God. And in
regard it will be most acceptable unto me that the said master or commander be
assisted in his just and lawful affairs, I do request you and every of you,
wheresoever the said master or commander shall arrive with his ship, and the
goods laden on board and carried in her, that you would be pleased to receave
him courteously, use him kindly, and admit him upon paying the lawful and
usual customs and other duties, to enter into, remain in, and pass from your
port, river and dominions, and there to enjoy all kind of right of navigation,
traffic and commerce, in all places where he shall think fit, which I shall
most willingly and readily acknowledge upon all occasions. In testimony and
confirmation whereof I have with my hand signed these presents, and caused them
to be sealed with the public seal of the colony above-written. Dated in Boston,
April 29, 1676, and 28th year of his Majesty's reign.

Second Enquiry. What laws and ordinances are now in force there derogatory or
contrary to those of England, and what oath is prescribed by the government?
The laws and ordinances made in that colony are no longer observed than as
they stand with their convenience. The magistrates not so strictly minding the
letter of the law when their public interest is concerned, in all cases more
regarding the quality and affection of the persons to their government than the
nature of their offense. They see no evil in a church member, and therefore it
is very difficult to get any sentence or verdict against him, though in the
smallest matters.

No law is in force or esteem there but such as are made by the general
court, and therefore it is accounted a breach of their privileges and a
betraying of the liberties of their commonwealth to urge the observation of the
laws of England or his Majesty's commands.

The laws most derogatory and contradictory to those of England.
All persons of the age of 21 years, being excommunicate or condemned, have
liberty to make wills and dispose of lands and estates.

In capital cases, dismembering or banishment; where no law is made by the
general court, or in case of defect of a law in any particular case, the
offender to be tried by the word of God and be judged by the general court.

Ministers are ordained by the people, and no injunction to be put upon any
church officer or member, in point of doctrine, worship or discipline, whether
for substance or circumstance, besides the institution of the Lord.

Whoever shall observe christmasse day, or the like festivity, by forbearing to
labor, feasting or other way shall pay 5 s. and whosoever shall not resort to
their meeting upon the Lord's day and such days of fasting and Thanksgiving as
shall be appointed by authority, shall pay 5 s. no days commanded by the laws
of England to be observed or regarded.

No person shall be impressed or compelled to serve in any wars but such as
shall be enterprized by that commonwealth, by the consent of a general court,
or by authority derived from them.

No person whatsoever shall join any persons in marriage but a magistrate, it
being an honorable ordinance and therefore should be accordingly sollemnized.

All strangers professing the true christian religion that shall fly to them
for succor from the tyranny or oppression of their persecutors, or for any
necessary or compulsory cause, they shall be entertained and protected amongst
them according to that power and prudence God shall give them. By which law
Whalley and Goffe and other traitors were kindly received and entertained by
Mr. Gookins and other magistrates.

Whosoever shall be in the possession of any land 5 years, although the grant of
said land was to another, and the possessor have nothing to show for the
alienation thereof but his possession, the possessor shall have the land
confirmed to him.

No oath shall be urged or required to be taken by any person but such oath as
the general court has considered allowed and required.

The oaths of allegiance and supremacy are neither taken by the magistrates nor
required to be taken by the inhabitants, only an oath of fidelity to the
government is imposed upon all persons as well strangers as inhabitants, upon
the penalty of 5 l. for every week they shall refuse the said oath. Unless they
gave security for their fidelity to the satisfaction of the court.


The oath of a stranger.
You A. B. do acknowledge yourselfe subject to the laws of this jurisdiction
during your residence under this government, and do swear by the great name of
the ever-living God and engage yourselfe to be true and faithful to the same,
and not to plot contrive or conceal any thing that is to the hurt or detriment
thereof. So help you God.

The oath of an inhabitant.
Whereas I A. B. am an inhabitant within this jurisdiction, considering how I
stand obliged to the king's majesty his heirs and successors by our charter,
and the government established thereby, do swear accordingly by the great and
dreadful name of the ever living God, that I will bear faith and true
allegiance to our sovereign lord the king his heirs and successors, and that I
will be true and faithful to the government and accordingly yield assistance
thereunto with my person and estate as in equity I am bound; and will also
truly endeavor and preserve and maintain all the liberties and privileges
thereof, submitting myself unto the wholesome laws made and established by
the same; and further, that I will not plot or practice any evil against it, or
consent to any that shall so do, but will truly discover and reveal the same
to lawful authority now here established for the speedy preventing thereof. So
help me God in our Lord Jesus Christ.

These and all other oaths are taken by holding up the hand and not by laying
the hand upon the book.

Third Enquiry. What number of church members, freemen, inhabitants, planters,
servants or slaves there are, of what profession and estates, and how many of
them men able to bear arms?
The magistrates and all other officers in the civil government or in any place
of profit or advantage are church members, and are consequently freemen, but
the number of the church members and freemen compared with the rest of the
inhabitants (who are termed the dissenting party) is very inconsiderable, not
being reckoned above one sixth part; the most wealthy persons of all
professions being men of good principles and well affected to his Majesty. It
is nothing but interest and design that draws most of the people into their
church membership and to think well of that religion and government they thrive
under.

The inhabitants within this government, including Hampshire and Main, are
computed to be upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand souls.

The chief professions are merchants who are principally seated at Boston,
Salem, Charlestown, and Portsmouth, and wealthy shop keepers or retailers, who
dwell in most towns of the colony, and get good estates. There are rich men of
all callings and professions, and all mechanical arts and occupations thrive
well.

The farmers are numerous and wealthy, live in good houses, are given to
hospitality, and make good advantage by their corn, cattle, poultry, butter and
cheese.

There are about 30 merchants that are esteemed worth from ten to twenty
thousand pounds; most have considerable estates and very great trades, and are
an industrious and thriving people. There are no servants but upon hired wages,
except some few who serve four years for the charge of being transported
thither by their masters, and not above 200 slaves in the colony, and those are
brought from Guinea and Madagascar.

There are men able to bear arms between 30 and 40,000 and in the town of
Boston is computed about 4000. This is an extravagant computation.


Fourth Enquiry. What number of horse and foot, and whether they be trained
bands or standing forces, and what old and experienced officers they have
amongst them?
They have no standing army, but their trained bands are twelve troops of horse
and six thousand foot; each troop consisting of 60 horse besides officers, are
all well mounted and completely armed with back, breast, headpiece, buffe coat,
sword, carbine and pistols, each troop distinguished by their coats. The foot
also are very well furnished with swords, muskets, and bandeliers. There are no
pikemen, they being of no use in the wars with the Indians. The late wars
have hardened their infantry, made them good firemen, and taught them the ready
use of their arms. The pay in time of war to a captain of horse is 6 l. per
month, to a captain of foot 4 l. to a common soldier one shilling a day besides
victuals, and in time of peace the officers have an allowance for their
expenses upon the days of muster. The present governor Mr. Leverett is the only
old soldier in the colony, he served in the late rebellion, under the usurper
Oliver Cromwell, as a captain of horse. The governor of the colony is always
general, and out of the rest of the magistrates is chosen the major-generall;
they are places of good profit The Governor never had more than L. 100 per
annum. I never met with any allowance to a Major General, and suppose he had
none except in actual action.
and no danger, they may stay at home and share the spoil, while younger men
command the army in the field against the enemy.

Fifth Enquiry. What castles and forts are in New England, and how situated,
and what store of provisions are they furnished withal?
Three miles from Boston, upon a small island, there is a castle of stone
lately built and in good repair, with four bastions and mounted with 38 guns,
16 whole culverin, commodiously seated upon a rising ground 60 paces from the
water side, under which at high water mark is a small stone battery of 6 guns,
these command all the vessels sailing up and down the channel of Boston. There
is six fathom water by the castle, and no good going up any other way. The
present commander is one Capt. Clap, an old man, his salary 50 l. per ann.
There belong to it six gunners, each 10 l. per ann. No soldiers are there, and
seldom above the captain and one gunner, who upon sight of any vessel coming up
set up his Majesty's flag, the only demonstration of his Majesty's authority in
those parts, to which all vessels are to strike, and none are to sail out from
Boston but they must send their pass to the captain, which is signed by the
governor, for which is paid 10 d. and if it be a bill of health, 14 d. There is
a small brick fort lately made at the south end of Boston, with two tire of
guns, 6 in each, as it is made it is of little use, no officers or soldiers
belong to it. One platform on the north side of the town, commanding the
river to Charlestown, made of loose stones and turfe, mounted with 5 demi
culverin, two small guns, no officers.

There is a small fort at Marblehead, upon a neck of land going up to the bay
of Boston, but of little use.

And upon the western point of Great Island, at the mouth of the river of
Pascataway, is a small fort in good repair, very commodiously seated and
mounted with 5 guns, formerly built by John Mason, Esquire from this river come the
masts and plankes for England. Every vessel above 20 tuns, not belonging to the
inhabitants of that colony, pays, per tun, pound of powder, or 9 pence in
money, which amounts to a considerable stock.

There are in the public stores commonly 1000 barrels of powder, with other
ammunition and arms proportionable, besides 6000 small arms lately come from
England.

At Dorchester, 7 miles from Boston, is a powder mill in good repair, well
wrought. There is in the country great quantities of saltpeter, especially upon
islands where foul frequent, and in swamps where pigeons roost. The powder is
as good and strong as the best English powder; the master of the work is one
Eversden, formerly of Battles in Sussex.

Great guns have formerly been cast in the country, but none at present, the
undertakers quarrelling among themselves, and so the works fell.

There is great plenty of iron oar, and as good iron made as any in Spain.
There are six forges for making of iron in that colony.

The town of Boston, the metropolis of the colony and the residence of the
governor and council is seated upon a peninsula, which with a small charge
might be made very strong, being encompassed by the sea, except a small neck of
land of 100 rods at low water, but not 20 at high. The town contains about 2000
houses, most built with timber and covered with shingles of cedar, as are most
of the houses in the country, some few are brick buildings and covered with
tyles.

Sixth Enquiry. What are the reputed boundaries and contents of land?
The ancient bounds of the Massachusetts colony was not above 20 miles upon the
sea coast, The bounds of the colony upon the sea coast were never controverted
nor uncertain.
but the present limits are as large as that government please to make them,
having some years since taken in the two entire provinces of Hampshire and
Main, by them, now called after other names and divided into 4 counties,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Middlesex and Yorkshire, besides several considerable towns
in the other colonies of New Plymouth and Connecticot; for the Massachusetts,
having the pre-eminence in trade, strength and riches, take the liberty to
claim as far as their convenience and interest directs, never wanting a
pretext of right to any place that is commodious for them, declaring they do
not know the boundaries of their commonwealth.

And though his Majesty's commissioners, in the year 1665, did settle the limits
of several colonies, especially the provinces of Hampshire and Main, and
declared to the inhabitants that, by his Majesty's commission and authority,
they were taken off from the government of the Massachusetts, to the general
satisfaction and rejoicing of the people, and did constitute justices of the
peace and other officers (with the approbation of the proprietors) to act and
govern according to the laws of England, and by such laws of their own as
were not repugnant thereunto, until his Majesty should take further order,
whereupon his Majesty, by his declaration to the corporation of Boston He
means the Massachusetts Colony often called Boston Government.
of the 10th of April 1666, did approve of the actings and proceeding of his
said commissioners, and did command that noe alteration should be made, either
in the boundaries or government of those colonies, and that all determinations
made by said commissioners should be observed and continue until his Majesty
should make his own final determination, yet nevertheless, noe sooner were
his Majesty's commissioners returned for England, but Mr. Leveret, the present
governor, Mr. Ting and Capt. Pike, and some others entered these provinces in an
hostile manner, with horse and foot, and subverted the government there settled
by the commissioners, imprisoned several persons, and compelled the
inhabitants to submit to their usurpations. And thus taking all opportunities
and advantages to improve their dominions and authority, the jurisdiction of
the Massachusetts is swelled into a very large territory.

Seventh Enquiry. What correspondence do they keep with their neighbors the
French, and the government of New York?
The French, upon the last treaty of peace concluded between the two crowns of
England and France, had Nova Scotia, now called Acadie, delivered up to them,
to the great discontent and murmuring of the government of Boston, that his
Majesty, without their knowledge or consent, should part with a place so
profitable to them, from whence they drew great quantities of beaver and other
peltry, besides the fishing for cod. Nevertheless, the people of Boston have
continued a private trade with the French and Indians inhabiting those parts,
for beaver-skins and other commodities, and have openly kept on their fishing
upon the said coast, though often Something is wanting to make out the sense.
by the French Kings lieftenant in Acadie last year.

Monsieur La Bourn, governor for the French King there, upon pretense, of some
affronts and injuries offered him by the government of Boston, did strictly
inhibit the inhabitants any trade with the English, and moreover laid an
imposition of 400 codfish upon every vessel that should fish upon the coasts,
and such as refused had their fish and provisions seized on and taken away.

The French have held a civil correspondence with the inhabitants of Hampshire
and Main and Dukes province, though the government of Boston, on all occasions,
is imposing upon the French, and encouraging an interloping trade, which causes
jealousies and fears in the inhabitants bordering upon Acadie, that the French
will, some time or other, suddenly fall upon them, to the breach of the
national peace. The government of the Massachusetts has a perfect hatred for
the French, because of their too near neighborhood, and loss of their trade,
and look upon them with an evil eye, believing they have had a hand in the
late war with the Indians.

As for New York, there were several things in matter of trade which
occasioned a difference between the two governments, which at length role so
high that it came to a stop of trade, the governor of New York not permitting
any European goods to be imported into that colony from Boston, that had not
certificate or other sufficient proof to have paid custom in England, which
has ever since occasioned a misunderstanding between them.

In the late Indian war, the government of Boston did greatly complain of
fort Albany, that from thence the Indians were supplied with arms and
ammunition, and were encouraged to begin and prosecute the war, but this
great outcry is judged by the wiser and sober sort of people to be without any
just cause, but rather a report raised out of malice and envy; for the
government of the Massachusetts love no government that is not like their own,
and therefore they were more kind and friendly to the Dutch (even in time of
war) when they were possessed of New York, than they are to their countrymen
the English. However, the governor of New York has proved very serviceable to
the Massachusetts in this war, and had the magistrates of Boston either
conferred with or hearkened to the advice of Colonel Andross, the Indian war
had either been diverted or proved less destructive; for he offered and would
have engaged the Mowhawkes and Maquot Indians to have falled upon the Sachem
Philip and his confederates, but his friendly advice and offers were slighted.
I never met with any evidence of this.
Nevertheless, Colonel Andross, out of his duty to his Majesty, kept the
aforesaid Indians from taking any part with the Sachim Philip.

Eighth Enquiry. What has been the original cause of the present war with
the natives. What are the advantages or disadvantages arising thereby and will
probably be the End?
Various are the reports and conjectures of the causes of the present Indian
war. Some impute it to an imprudent zeal in the magistrates of Boston to
christianize those heathen before they were civilized and injoyning them the
strict observation of their laws, which, to a people so rude and licentious,
has proved even intolerable, and that the more, for that while the
magistrates, for their profit, put the laws severely in execution against the
Indians, the people, on the other side, for lucre and gain, entice and provoke
the Indians to the breach thereof, especially to drunkenness, to which those
people are so generally addicted that they will strip themselves to their skin
to have their fill of rume and brandy, the Massachusetts having made a law that
every Indian drunk should pay 10 s. or be whipped, according to the discretion
of the magistrate. Many of these poor people willingly offered their back to
the lash to save their money; whereupon, the magistrates finding much trouble
and no profit to arise to the government by whipping, did change that
punishment into 10 days work for such as could not or would not pay the fine
of 10 s. which did highly incense the Indians.

Some believe there have been vagrant and jesuiticall priests, who have made it
their business, for some years past, to go from Sachim to Sachim, to
exasperate the Indians against the English and to bring them into a
confederacy, and that they were promised supplies from France and other parts
to extirpate the English nation out of the continent of America. Others impute
the cause to some injuries offered to the Sachim Philip; for he being possessed
of a tract of land called Mount Hope, a very fertile, pleasant and rich soil,
some English had a mind to dispossess him thereof, who never wanting one
pretense or other to attain their end, complained of injuries done by Philip
and his Indians to their stock and cattle, whereupon Philip was often summoned
before the magistrate, sometimes imprisoned, and never released but upon
parting with a considerable part of his land.

But the government of the Massachusetts (to give it in their own words) do
declare these are the great evils for which God has given the heathen
commission to rise against them: The woeful breach of the 5th commandment, in
contempt of their authority, which is a sin highly provoking to the Lord: For
men wearing long hair and perewigs made of women's hair; for women wearing
borders of hair and for cutting, curling and laying out the hair, and
disguising themselves by following strange fashions in their apparel: For
profanesse in the people not frequenting their meetings, and others going away
before the blessing be pronounced: For suffering the Quakers to live amongst
them and to set up their threshholds by Gods thresholds, contrary to their old
laws and resolutions. Massa. History, Vol. I. p. ^21.


With many such reasons, but whatever be the cause, the English have
contributed much to their misfortunes, for they first taught the Indians the
use of arms, and admitted them to be present at all their musters and
trainings, and showed them how to handle, mend and fix their muskets, and have
been furnished with all sorts of arms by permission of the government, so that
the Indians are become excellent firemen. And at Natick there was a gathered
church of praying Indians, who were exercised as trained bands, under officers
of their own; these have been the most barbarous and cruel enemies to the
English of any others. Capt. Tom, their leader, being lately taken and hanged
at Boston, with one other of their chiefs.

That notwithstanding the ancient law of the country, made in the year 1633,
that no person should sell any arms or ammunition to any Indian upon penalty
of 10 l. for every gun, 5 l. for a pound of powder, and 40 s. for a pound of
shot, yet the government of the Massachusetts in the year 1657, upon design to
monopolize the whole Indian trade did publish and declare that the trade of
furrs and peltry with the Indians in their jurisdiction did solely and properly
belong to their commonwealth and not to every indifferent person, and did enact
that no person should trade with the Indians for any sort of peltry, except
such as were authorized by that court, under the penalty of 100 l. for every
offense, giving liberty to all such as should have license from them to sell,
unto any Indian, guns, swords, powder and shot, paying to the treasurer 3 d.
for each gun and for each dozen of swords; 6 d. for a pound of powder and for
every ten pound of shot, by which means the Indians have been abundantly
furnished with great store of arms and ammunition to the utter ruin and
undoing of many families in the neighboring colonies to enrich some few of
their relations and church members.

No advantage but many disadvantages have arisen to the English by the war,
for about 600 men have been slain, and 12 captains, most of them brave and
stout persons and of loyal principles, whilst the church members had liberty
to stay at home and not hazard their persons in the wilderness.

The loss to the English in the several colonies, in their habitations and
stock, is reckoned to amount to 150,000 l. there having been about 1200 houses
burned, 8000 head of cattle, great and small, killed, and many thousand bushels
of wheat, pease and other grain burned (of which the Massachusetts colony has
not been damnifyed one third part, the great loss falling upon New Plymouth
and Connecticot colonies) Randolph shows his malice against the Massachusetts in
this misrepresentation for Connecticut suffered but little by the war, and the
Massachusetts lost more of their substance as well as of their inhabitants than
both the other colonies together.
and upward of 3000 Indians men women and children destroyed, who if well
managed would have been very serviceable to the English, which makes all manner
of labor dear.

The war at present is near an end. In Plymouth colony the Indians surrender
themselves to Gov. Winslow, upon mercy, and bring in all their arms, are wholly
at his disposal, except life and transportation; but for all such as have been
notoriously cruel to women and children, so soon as discovered they are to be
executed in the sight of their fellow Indians.

The government of Boston have concluded a peace upon these terms.

1. That there be henceforward a firm peace between the Indians and English.

2. That after publication of the articles of peace by the general court, if
any English shall wilfully kill an Indian, upon due proof, he shall dye, and
if an Indian kill an Englishman and escape, the Indians are to produce him, and
he to pass trial by the English laws.

That the Indians shall not conceal any known enemies to the English, but shall
discover them and bring them to the English.

That upon all occasions the Indians are to aid and assist the English against
their enemies, and to be under English command.

That all Indians have liberty to sit down at their former habitations without
let.

Ninth Enquiry. What are the commodities of the production, growth and
manufacture of the country, and what are those imported from other places, and
particularly how the trade and navigation is carried on, whether directly to
and from England or otherwise, what number of ships do trade thither yearly,
and of what burden they are, and where built; and lastly, what notice is taken
of the act of navigation?
The commodities of the production, growth and manufacture of New England are,
all things necessary for shipping and naval furniture in great abundance, as
excellent oak, elm, beech, fur, pines for masts the best in the world,
pitch, tar, hemp, and iron not inferior to that of Bilboa, clapboards, pipe
staves, plankes and dealboards, so that his Majesty need not be beholding to
other nations for naval stores.

It abounds with horses, beefes, sheep, hogs and goats, with mighty numbers of
wild beasts, as beaver, otter, moose, deer, stags, foxes, musquash, and
several other sorts, whose skins produce great profit yearly. Also great
plenty of wheat, rye, barley, oats and pease, fruits of most kinds, especially
apples, whereof they make great quantities of excellent cider. Fish of all
sorts, especially cod, mackarell and herring, which are very large and fat.
These are the staple commodities and are exported.

To Virginia, Jamaica and Maryland, beef and porke salted, pease, flower,
biscuit and malt, coddfish and salt mackarell.

To Barbados, Nevis, St. Christopher and the other islands, the above
commodities, together with horses, dealboards, pipestaves, and houses ready
framed.

To Spain, Portugal and the Straights, Maderas and Canary islands, fish and
timber, pipestaves and dealboards.

To England, masts and yards for ships, fur and oak plankes, with all sorts
of peltry.

The commodities imported from the plantations are tobacco, sugar, indico,
cotton wool, ginger, logwood, fustick, cocao and rume, the which are again
transported to other parts.

The trade and navigation is carried on by a general traffic to most parts of
Europe, as England, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, France, Portugal, Holland,
Canaries, and the Hans towns, carrying to each place such commodities as are
vendible, either of their own growth and manufacture or those of the other
plantations, and do make their returns in such goods as are necessary and
vendible either in New England, or in any other of his Majesty's dominions in
America; as brandy, Canary, Spanish and French wines, bullion, salt, fruits,
oils, silks, laces, linen of all sorts, cloth, serges, bays, kersies,
stockings, and many other commodities, which they distribute into all parts of
the West Indies; so that there is little left for the merchants residing in
England to import into any of the plantations, those of New England being able
to afford their goods much cheaper than such who pay the customs and are laden
in England. By which means this kingdom has lost the best part of the
western trade, there being very little exported hence but only such commodities
as are properly the product and manufacture of England and cannot be had in
other parts.

It is the great care of the merchants to keep their ships in constant employ,
which makes them try all ports to force a trade, whereby they abound with all
sorts of commodities, and Boston may be esteemed the mart town of the West
Indies.

There are some ships lately sent to Guinea, Madagascar and those coasts, and
some to Scanderoon, laden with masts and yards for ships.

There are several vessels yearly built there and sold in England and other
parts, which they build very cheap.

There are built in and belong to that jurisdiction.

30 200 200 300 Vessels from 100 50 30 6 to 250 100 50 10 Tuns.

There are about 30 master builders of ships, and ship-carpenters and other
workmen and artificers proportionable.

The chief places for building are Boston, Charlestown, Salem, Ipswich,
Salisbury and Portsmouth. Good ships are built for four pounds the tun.

There is no notice taken of the act of navigation, plantation, or any other
laws made in England for the regulation of trade. All nations having free
liberty to come into their ports and vend their commodities, without any
restraint; and in this as well as in other things, that government would make
the world believe they are a free state and do act in all matters accordingly,
and do presume to give passports to ships, not only belonging to that colony
but also to England, without any regard to those rules prescribed by his
Majesty.

Tenth Enquiry. What are the taxes and fines laid upon the country, what rates
and duties are charged upon goods exported and imported, what public revenue
does arise to the government, of what nature it is and how and by whom it is
collected and exacted?
The taxes laid upon the country and duly collected are,

Poll-money. Every male person of 16 years of age and upwards, both inhabitant,
lodger, child, servant or slave, pays yearly one shilling and eight pence per
head.

Land Tax. Upon all estates real and personal there is paid yearly, one
penny for every twenty shillings value, upon lands, houses, mills, ships,
goods, cattle, and all other known estate, whether at home or at sea. The
estates of merchants and shopkeepers, being inhabitants, are rated by the rule
of common estimation, according to the will and doom of the assessors. All
handicraftsmen are rated for their returns and gains in their callings
proportionable to others. Every merchant stranger's estate is rated and pays
according to the cargo he brings into the country.

Lawsuits. All actions of the value of two pounds pay at entry 10 s. of ten
pounds, 15 s. of twenty pounds and upwards, 20 s. petitions to the court to
obtain a debt or favor 10 s. Magistrates and ministers and church elders pay
no pollmoney or other taxes upon lands or personal estates.

Customs. Upon all goods imported either by sea or land.

L. s. d. All goods, wares and merchandises, living cattle and provisions does
pay for every hundred pound value 0 10 0 Fayall wines or of the western
islands, per tun, 0 10 0 Madera wine 0 13 4 Canary, Sherry and Malaga wine 1 0
0 French wines 0 10 0 Brandy wine 2 0 0 Every ship of 200 tuns and upward pays
0 10 0 And small vessels, each voyage 0 6 8 Stranger's vessels according to
their burth. p. tun, 0 0 6 Every vessel above 20 tuns not built in the colony
pays each voyage half a pound of powder per tun, or in money 0 0 9 Excise.
Upon all liquors retayled in public houses, cider, beer and ale, per hogshead
0 2 6 Mumme, the hogshead 0 5 0 Vintners and retailers of wine do pay per tun
5 0 0 Brandy and all strong liquors per gallon 0 0 8

All public houses are licensed by the magistrates and are obliged to clear
their accounts of excise monthly, upon oath.

For arms and ammunition sold to the Indians.

For each gun 3 s. For powder the pound 6 d. For a dozen swords 3 s. For shot
every ten pound 6 d.

No custom upon any thing exported except horses, which pay 6 d.

The public revenue of the colony is computed to be upwards of 20000 l.
Randolph has put one cipher more than he should have done. Their annual charges
never rose to L.2000 until the Indian war, then indeed they were greatly
increased, but not the revenue in any proportion, the colony being left greatly
in debt which was not paid in several years.
and is disposed of as the governor and magistrates think fit, without giving
any account to the country, by which means whosoever comes into the magistracy
has an opportunity of growing rich and advancing his relations; it being
exceeding profitable to be a magistrate of that corporation. It was generally
believed there was a great bank of money in the treasury, there having been
large sums collected from the year 1652, and little occasion of public expense
besides salaries to the magistrates and other officers, and maintaining a
public table: But, upon occasion of a present supply for carrying on the
Indian war, it was desired by several of the principal inhabitants that
moneys might be issued out of the public treasury, but upon examination it
appeared that stock had been otherwise disposed of and not one penny to be
found, so that for the war 50000 l. has been raised upon the colony. This, I
doubt not, is a most injurious insinuation.


The poll money and land taxes are paid in money, and collected by the
constables of each town. The customs are most commonly paid in money, or the
best of the specie at price current, and are collected by officers purposely
appointed, the present collectors being the governor's son in law and the late
treasurer's son.

The excise is gathered by such as the treasurer deputes and is paid in money.

There is a reasonable quantity of silver money in the colony, but no gold.

Eleventh Enquiry. How they generally stand affected to the government of
England, what persons are most popular and at present in the magistracy, or
like to be at next election?
The inhabitants are generally well affected to his Majesty and his
government, as well the merchants and farmers as the meaner traders and
artificers, who groan under the yoke of the present government, and are in
daily hopes and expectations of a change, by his Majesty's reassuming the
authority and settling a general government over the whole country, without
which it is feared civil wars will in a short time break out between the
colonies, the government of the Massachusetts daily imposing and incroaching
upon their neighbors, and therefore the loyal colonies of New Plymouth,
Connecticot, New Hampshire and Main, seeing these inconveniences daily
increasing by a divided government, are very desirous of submitting to a
general governor to be established by his Majesty. Not one man in a hundred
throughout the governments then desired it.


Amongst the magistrates some are good men and well affected to his Majesty,
and would be well satisfied to have his Majesty's authority in a better manner
established, but the major part are of different principles, having been in the
government from the time they formed themselves into a commonwealth. These
direct and manage all affairs as they please, of which number are Mr.
Leverett, governor, Mr. Symons, deputy governor, Mr. Danforth, Mr. Ting,
Major Clarke and Major Hathorn, still continued a magistrate, though commanded by
his Majesty upon his allegiance to come into England, yet refused, being
encouraged in his disobedience by a vote of the court, not to appear, upon some
reasons best known to themselves. Massa. History Vol I. p. 253.
These, with some few others of the same faction, keep the country in
subjection and slavery, backed with the authority of a pretended charter. These
magistrates have continually disobeyed his Majesty's command contained in his
royal letters 1662, 64, 65, 66, and those of March last, ever reserving to
themselves a power to alter, evade and disanull any law or command not agreeing
with their humor, or the absolute authority of their government, acknowledging
no superior or admitting any appeal to his Majesty, whose arms are not set up
in any of their courts, meetings or public assemblies.

The most popular and well principled men are Major Denison, Mr. Broadstreet
and Mr. Dudley, in the magistracy; and of military men Major Savage, Captains
Curwin, Saltonstall, Brattle, Richards, Gillam, Moseley, Majory, Champernoon,
Shapleigh, Phillips, with many others, who only wait for an opportunity to
express their duty to his Majesty.

The present magistrates are Mr. Leverett, governor, Mr. Symons, deputy
governor, Major Dennison, Mr. Ting, Danforth, Bradstreet, Hathorn, Pynchon,
Stoughton, Clarke, Dudley, Russell lately dead.

Whoever are in the magistracy do for the most part continue till death, by
the help of persons of their faction and of a law commanding that at every new
election the former magistrates be first put to vote, upon penalty of ten
pounds.

The clergy are for the most part very civil and inclining to his Majesty's
government, being held in subjection by the ruling elders, who govern all
affairs of the church.

Twelfth Enquiry. What is the present state of the ecclesiastical government,
how are the universities, at present, filled and by whom governed?
The ecclesiastical government is in the hands of lay elders, these being the
laws and constitutions.

No person is permitted to gather a church without the approbation of three of
the magistrates and the elders of the neighbor churches.

Every church has liberty of election and ordination of officers and ministers
to exercise all the ordinances of God, according to the rules of the scripture.
To celebrate days of fasting, prayer and thankesgiving, according to the word
of God. No injunction to be put upon any church, church officer, or member in
point of doctrine, worship or discipline, whether for substance or
circumstance, besides the institution of the Lord. Has liberty of admission,
recommendation, dismission and expulsion of their officers and members, with
free exercise of the discipline and censures of Christ, according to the rules
of the word.

The civil authority has power to see the peace, ordinances and rules of
Christ observed in every church and to deal with any church member, in a way of
civil justice, notwithstanding any church relation, office or interest.

No church censure shall degrade or depose any man from any civil dignity,
office or authority he shall have in the commonwealth.

Whosoever shall interrupt any minister in his preaching or charging him with
any error he has not taught, shall pay five pounds.

The ministry in Boston are paid by a collection weekly made in the several
congregations, by the elders, who give the minister what they think fit; but in
other towns they have a settled maintenance by a rate laid on every inhabitant,
and houses are provided for them.

There are three colleges built in Cambridge, one with timber at the charge of
Mr. Harvard and bears his name; a small brick building called the Indian
college, where some few Indians did study, but now it is a printing house;
new-colledge, built at the public charge, is a fair pile of brick building
covered with tiles, by reason of the late Indian war not yet finished. It
contains 20 chambers for students, two in a chamber; a large hall, which serves
for a chapel; over that a convenient library, with some few books of the
ancient fathers and school divines, but in regard divinity is the general
study, there are many English books of the late nonconformist writers,
especially of Mr. Baxter and Dr. Owen. Here they teach Hebrew before they well
understand Latin. No formalities or distinctions of habits, or other decencies,
as in England, much less these exhibitions and supports for scholars. They
take no degrees above master of arts.

Their commencement, kept yearly the 2d of August, in the meeting house, where
the governor and magistrates are present, attended with throngs of illiterate
elders and church members, who are entertained with English speeches and
verses. Most of the students are come for England, and at present no settled
president, but one Mr. Oaks, a rigid independent, supplies the place. The
allowance of the president is 100 l. per ann. and a good house. There are but 4
fellowships, the two seniors have each 30 l. per ann. and the two juniors 15 l.
but no diet is allowed: These are tutors to all such as are admitted students.
Mr. Thomas Graves, an ingenious and worthy person, was put by his fellowship,
by the late Dr. Hoar, because he would not renounce the church of England. The
government of these colleges is in the governor and magistrates of the
Massachusetts and the president of the college, together with the teaching
elders of the six adjacent towns.

As to the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot, it is humbly offered.

The laws of England are there observed with such of their own as are not
contradictory thereunto. The oath of allegiance is taken by every magistrate
and officer, whether civil or military, and by all freemen. All commissions,
proclamations, writs and summons are in his Majesty's name.

The number of inhabitants in both colonies are computed to be 80000 souls.
There are noe slaves, only hired servants. The chief professions are farmers,
grasiers and fishermen. Very few merchants, they being supplied with all
foreign commodities from Boston.

The militia consists of 4 troops of horse and 5 regiments of foot, who are
well armed and disciplined, no old soldiers among them. The number fit to bear
arms 20000.

The country is very fertile and pleasant and abounds in corn and cattle, and
produces very good horses, the best in all N. E. which are sent into several
parts. There is great abundance of tar and excellent good hemp, and there is
made good quantity of whale oil, which fish they take upon the coasts. The act
of navigation is duly observed. No stranger is admitted to come into their
ports. They have no ships of burden, but only small ketches and barks, to
trade along the coasts and take fish.

They are generally very loyal and good people, and do upon all occasions
express great love to the person and government of his Majesty, and do
heartily wish that his Majesty's authority were established over the whole
country.

The present governor of New Plymouth is Josiah Winslow, Esquire a person eminently
popular and beloved in all the colonies of N. E. and was general of the united
forces against the Indians.

The governor of Connecticot is Wm. Leet, Esquire a very worthy person, as are most
of the magistrates of that colony.

The losses which these colonies have sustained by the Indian war is
estimated to be near 100,000 pound.

This is (may it please your Lordships) the best account I have been able to
gather, during my short stay in those parts, as well from my own observation as
from the information of others. And for what passed particularly between the
magistrates of Boston and myself, upon the delivery of my letters, and with the
inhabitants of that and the other colonies, I have presented his Majesty with
a short narrative. A copy whereof is herunto annexed.

12 October 1676. Edward Randolph.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty.
A short narrative touching the delivery of your Majesty's letters to the
magistrates of Boston in New England, by Edward Randolph.
May it please your Majesty,
HAVING received your Majesty's letters for the governor and magistrates of
your Majesty's town of Boston in N. E. dated 20th of March last, with my
particular instructions from the right hon. Mr. secretary Coventry, upon the
30th of the said month I sailed from the Downs. After a tedious passage of 10
weeks arrived at Boston on 10th June. At my landing I went immediately to the
governor John Leveret, and showed him your Majesty's pass and acquainted him
with the cause of my coming, and that I had brought a letter from his Majesty
unto the magistrates of that colony, and did therefore desire him that, with
what convenient speed might be, the magistrates might be assembled to hear your
Majesty's letter read. The governor answered, that the council was to meet that
afternoon, upon other business, and that then I should be sent for; as I was,
by the marshall of their court; where being come and admitted into the
council, I delivered your Majesty's letters to the governor, there being six
of the magistrates and their secretary assembled with him, and there being a
chair placed purposely for me, I was desired by the governor to sit.

The governor having opened your Majesty's letter said to the rest of the
magistrates, it was a letter from your Majesty, and looking to the bottom of
the letter, he read by his Majesty's command Hen. Coventry. The governor asked
me who that Mr. Coventry was. I told him he was your Majesty's principal
secretary of state.

At the beginning of the reading of your Majesty's letter, the whole council
being covered, I put off my hat; whereupon three of the magistrates took off
their hats and sat uncovered; but the governor with the rest continued to keep
their hats on.

Your Majesty's letters, with the enclosed petitions of Mr. Mason and Mr.
Gorges, being read in my hearing, the governor told the council that the
matters therein contained were very inconsiderable things and easily answered,
and it did no way concern that government to take any notice thereof. I
acquainted them that your Majesty had commanded me to require an answer of
your said letters, and for which your Majesty had ordered me one month to
attend. The governor answered, that they should consider of those things.
Whereupon I withdrew.

Then I delivered the particular letters of Mr. Mason, which he had writ unto
several of the most eminent inhabitants of Boston, some whereof are the
principal officers of the militia. These gentlemen received me with much
kindness and expressed great loyalty to your Majesty. The letters he wrote
were to give them an account of the contents of your Majesty's letters, his own
complaints against the proceedings of that government, with the occasion of my
coming into these parts, desiring them to communicate the same to others, the
which was soon spread abroad, to the great pleasure and satisfaction of all
those who are well-wishers to your Majesty.

Within a day or two after my arrival, I met with a report which seemed
artificially raised to amuse and distract the people about domestique troubles
here in England, the sum whereof was, that the Duke of York, with diverse of
the nobility, upon discontent, had left the court, and had applied themselves
to the city for assistance, and that all was going to confusion at home. This
was reported with much confidence, and said to be writ from some very good
people in London, and therefore must be true. I soon confuted this report, by
many arguments, showing them the falsenesse of it, and so in a short time it
vanished.

After two days consideration it was resolved in their council that thanks be
returned to your Majesty for your gracious letter, and that an answer be
forthwith sent by a master of a vessel ready to sail for London.

The 15th of June I was sent for to the council. The governor asked me
whether I intended for London by that ship that was ready to sail, if so I
should have a duplicate of their letter to your Majesty, the original being
to accompany his own particular answer to a letter he had received from Mr.
secretary Williamson by the same master of the ship I came with. I told them I
had other matters of concern under my charge, and should not return so soon,
and withal asked them if they had well considered of his Majesty's letter and
the enclosed petition in so short a time, and concluded on their agents and the
time of their going for England, to which they gave me no reply, but the
governor asked me if I had any thing further to offer them from your Majesty,
I told them I had nothing further to communicate to them, whereupon the
governor said that he looked upon me as Mr. Mason's agent, and that I might
withdraw.

The day after, I went to visit the governor at his house, and among other
discourse I told him I took notice of several ships that were arrived at
Boston, some since my being there, from Spain, France, Streights, Canaries and
other parts of Europe, contrary to your Majesty's laws for encouraging
navigation, and regulating the trade of the plantations. He freely declared to
me that the laws made by your Majesty and your parliament obliges them in
nothing but what consists with the interest of that colony, that the
legislative power is and abides in them solely to act and make laws by virtue
of a charter from your Majesty's royal father, and that all matters in
difference are to be concluded by their final determination, without any
appeal to your Majesty, and that your Majesty ought not to retrench their
liberties, but may enlarge them if your Majesty please, and said, your
Majesty had confirmed their charter and all their privileges by your Majesty's
letter of the 28th of June 1662, and that your Majesty could do no less in
reason than let them enjoy their liberties and trade, they having upon their
own charge and without any contribution from the crown made so large plantation
in the wilderness, and that during the Dutch wars your Majesty sent
ammunition to New-Yorke for that place, but sent them word they must shift for
themselves and make the best defense they could, and that notwithstanding the
colony had many enemies, yet they did believe your Majesty to be their very
good friend, for that your Majesty had by several letters expressed your
great kindness to them.

Within a few days after I met with one Mr. Harris, a gentleman who arrived
there from England about six months before, who told me that at his arrival at
Boston, he was, according to their law, conducted to the governor, which
enjoins all masters of vessels to bring all passengers to the governor upon
penalty of 20 l. who enquiring of him if he knew Mr. Mason and whether he was
coming over and what commissioners were coming with him, Mr. Harris told him
there was a report that Mr Mason was to come over. The governor then said he
had received information from England that commissioners had come over last
summer or the spring, but that your Majesty had not money to defrey that
charge and set them forth, and did therefore beleave no commissioners would
come.

The 23d June I gave in a memorial to the governor, the council being then
assembled at his house, wherein I acquainted them that in pursuance of my
instructions I did remind then of your Majesty's command of sending over agents
that might be sufficiently qualified and empowered, and did desire that seeing
a general court seemed much more proper for dispatch of matters of so great
and weighty concerns, that a general court might on this occasion be
assembled, that so I might receave their deliberate and solemn answer to your
Majesty's letters, for the which I would attend. But hereunto they gave me no
other answer then that when I was ready to sail for England I should have a
copy of their letter which they had writ unto your Majesty.

About the beginning of July, I went into the province of New Hampshire,
belonging unto Mr. Mason, but now divided by the Bostoneers into three
counties, and by them called Norfolk, Suffolk and Middlesex. And travailed
through several of the most considerable towns, acquainting the inhabitants
with the occasion of my coming into the country, and read Mr. Mason's letter
unto them, which gave them great satisfaction, the whole country complaining of
the oppression and usurpation of the magistrates of Boston, imposing ministers
upon them, not admitting them to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, denying
baptism to their children, and liberty of choosing their own magistrates and
officers because they were not members of their congregations. And as a farther
mark of their power and sovereignty over them they send twice a year
magistrates from Boston to keep courts for trying of causes, and that they lay
at pleasure what impositions, fines and taxes they think fit upon their
estates, persons and trade, contrary to the laws of England, and that they
have been for a long time earnestly expecting to be delivered from the
government of the Massachusetts Bay, and do now humbly hope your Majesty will
not permit them any longer to be oppressed, but will be graciously pleased to
give them relief, according to the promises made them by your Majesty's
commissioners in 1665, who were then in that province, and declared them not to
be under the government of Boston.

And being at Portsmouth, a town of very great trade, lying upon the river of
Piscataway, in the northermost part of New Hampshire, about seventy miles from
Boston, several of the principal inhabitants of the province of Main,
belonging unto Mr. Gorges, and now by the Bostoneers, since the seizing
thereof, called Yorkshire, came unto me making the same complaints, with those
of New Hampshire, entreating me to represent their condition to your Majesty
and are passionately expecting relief, some of them having been suffered to be
ruined by the Indians for having formerly expressed their duty to your Majesty
when your Majesty's commissioners were in that country, and for having taken
commissions from them to act as justices of the peace.

At my return to Boston I received a message from Josiah Winslow, Esquire governor
of your Majesty's colony of New-Plymouth, desiring I would give him a visit
before I left New England. Whereupon I made a journey to him, whom I found a
gentleman of loyal principles and has showed himself a person of great courage
and conduct in the management of the Indian war, those barbarous people being
chiefly overcome by his conduct and troops, which makes him to be feared and
not loved by his neighbors the Bostoners.

In his discourse he expressed his great dislike of the carriage of the
magistrates of Boston to your Majesty's royal person and your subjects under
their government; of their incroaching upon the rights, trades and possessions
of the neighboring colonies, laying what rates they please on the commodities
and products of the other colonies imported into their harbors; the daily
breach of your Majesty's laws concerning trade and navigation, trading with
and encouraging all nations so trade with them, to the great prejudice and
detrement of your Majesty and this your kingdom: And that he, finding the
inconveniences of a divided government daily arising, did say, that New England
could never be secure, flourish, nor be serviceable to your Majesty, until
the several colonies and plantations were reduced under your Majesty's
immediate government, and that the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot
would readily and willingly submitt to your Majesty's pleasure and commands in
the disposal and settlement of the civil government.

That during my stay at Boston I made acquaintance with several of the chief
inhabitants and some of the magistrates, and did particularly inform myself of
the humor, disposition and affections of the people, and found the principal
inhabitants, some whereof are the chief officers of the militia, and the
generality of the people complaining of the arbitrary government and oppression
of their magistrates and do hope your Majesty will be pleased to free them
from this bondage by establishing your own royal authority among them and
govern them according to your Majesty's laws. And many of the better sort did
entreat me to represent this their condition to your Majesty, not daring
publicly to express their desires or complaint by petition, because of the
severity and arbitrary proceeding of their rulers, and that many of them have
been sufferers for petitioning formerly. Although at the general court in October.
1666, upon occasion of your Majesty's letter and declaration of the 10th April
in the said year, which petition was subscribed by upwards of 100 of the
principal inhabitants of that colony, wherein they did assert your Mejesties
right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over them, a copy whereof is hereunto
annexed, being given me by some of the chief persons that had subscribed it,
desiring that your Majesty might see the same; these gentlemen so delivering
this petition, did then receave a severe check, the petition voted scandalous,
they styled the betrayers of the libertyes of that colony and ill-affected to
that government, for which some of them have been greatly prejudiced in their
estates and fortunes, and still lie under many inconveniences, and are not
admitted into any offices of the government or choice of the magistrates.

Being ready to return for England, the time allotted by your Majesty being
expired, I went to the governor on the 20th July, for my dispatches, and was
entertained by him with a sharp reproof for publishing the substance of my
errand into those parts, contained in your Majesty's letters, as also in Mr.
Masons petition and what he represented to his friends there, with that of Mr.
Gorges unto the inhabitants of Boston, New Hampshire and Main, telling me that
I designed to make a mutiny and disturbance in the country and to withdraw the
people from their obedience to the magistracy of that colony and the authority
thereof. I told him, if I had done any thing amiss, upon complaint made to
your Majesty he would certainly have justice done him.

The governor then gave me the duplicate of a letter directed unto the right
honorable Mr. Secretary Coventry, which he told me was the answer which the
council thought fit to give to your Majesty's letters, the original being
sent for England a month before.

At my departure from him, both he and some of the magistrates, severally,
entreated me to give a favorable report of the country and the magistrates
thereof, adding, that those that blessed them God would bless, and those that
cursed them God would curse. And withal, desired me to acquaint your Majesty
that whatever reports were raised against them, by wicked and evil minded men,
to draw away your Majesty's grace and favor from them, yet they were a people
truly fearing the Lord and very obedient to your Majesty.

So that although by your Majesty's command I was sent to the magistrates of
Boston, and was named in your royal letters as one who should solicit a fit
determination in the business depending, and bring back the answer thereof,
yet I must wholly refer myself to their own answer, they not having thought fit
to acquaint me with the contents thereof.

All which I do most humbly certify.
20 September 1676.
To the honored general court now assembled in Boston.
May it please this honored court,
YOUR humble petitioners being informed that letters are lately sent from his
Majesty to the governor and council, expressing his ill resentment of the
proceedings of this colony with his commissioners lately sent hither, and
requiring also some persons therein particularly named, with command upon their
allegiance, to attend his Majesty's pleasure, in order to a final determination
of such differences and debates as have happened between his Majesty's said
commissioners and the government here; which declaration of his Majesty your
petitioners looking at as a matter of the greatest importance and justly
calling for more serious consideration, that they might neither be wanting to
yourselves in withholding any encouragement that their concurrence might afford
in so arduous a matter, nor to themselves and the country being involved by
their silence, in the dangerous mistakes of some persons (though otherwise
well-minded) inclining to disloyal principles, they desire they may have
liberty, without offense, to propose some of their thoughts and fears about
that matter unto your most serious consideration.

Your petitioners humbly conceave that they who live in this age of the world
are not less than others concerned in that advice of the wiseman, to keep the
kings commandment, and that because of the oath of God, and not to be hasty to
go out of his sight that does whatsoever pleases him. Wherefore they desire
that seeing his Majesty has already taken no little displeasure against us as
if we disowned his Majesty's jurisdiction over us, effectual care may be taken
lest by refusing to attend his Majesty's orders for clearing pretenses unto
right favor in that particular, we should plunge ourselves into greater
disfavour and danger.

The receaving a charter from his Majesty's royal predecessor for the planting
of this colony, with a confirmation of the same from his royal person, by our
late address sufficiently declare this place to be part of his dominions, and
ourselves his subjects, in testimony of which also our first governor Mr.
Matthew Cradock, as we are informed, stands recorded juratus de fide and
obedientia before one of the masters of chancery, whence it is evident that if
any proceedings of this colony have given occasion to his Majesty to say that
we beleave he has no jurisdiction over us, what effectual course had need be
taken to free ourselves from incuring his Majesty's farther displeasure, by
continuing in so dangerous an offense, and to give his Majesty all due
satisfaction in that point? Such an assertion would be no less destructive to
our welfare than derogatory to his Majesty's honor. The doubtful
interpretation of the words of a patent, which there can be no reason to
believe can ever be construed to the divesting of a sovereign prince of his
royal power over his natural subjects and liege people, is too frail a
foundation to build such a transcendent immunity and privilege upon.

Your petitioners shall ever be willing to acknowledge to the utmost how much
they are bound to yourselves and others in the like capacity for your abundant
care and pains in carrying on they government of this colony and endeavoring
to uphold the liberties thereof, and should not be unwilling to run any hazard
with you for the regular defense and security of the same, and would be most
unwilling to reflect upon the persons of them they so much honor and respect,
by a necessary dissenting from them in some things wherein they could not
approve the reasons of their proceedings, but in matters of so great
concernment as that now in agitation, wherein the honor of God, the credit of
religion, as well as the interest of our own persons and estates are all
concerned.

They earnestly desire, that no party will so irresistably carry on any design
of so dangerous consequence as to necessitate their brethren, equally engaged
with them in the same undertaking, to make a particular address to his
Majesty and declaration to the world to clear themselves from the least
imputation of so scandalous an evil, as the appearance of disaffection, or
disloyalty to the person and government of their lawful prince and sovereign
would be.

Wherefore your petitioners do humbly entreat, that if any occasion has been
given unto his Majesty so to resent any of your former actions, as in his last
letter is held forth, that nothing of that nature be further proceeded in, but
contrawise that application be made to his Majesty by meet persons immediately
to be sent for that end, to clear the transactions of them that govern this
colony from any such construction, least otherwise that, which duly improved,
might have been as a cloud of the latter rain, be turned into that which in the
conclusion may be more terrible than the roaring of a lion.

Thus craving a favorable interpretation of what is here humbly presented,
your petitioners shall ever be obliged to thankefullnesse.

This petition was signed by upwards of an hundred of the principal inhabitants
of the Massachusetts colony, and presented by them to the general court at
their meeting in Boston in October 1666, upon occasion of his Majesty's
declaration of the 10th of April in the same year. This I have no doubt is a
true copy of a petition which appears by the records to have been presented to
the general court and, if it had been presented twenty years before, the court
would have made the petitioners smart for their intermeddling, as they did
Child and others. See Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 147.


Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Knowles to Governor Leverett.
London, this 6 July 1677. Ever honored Sir,
THERE comes with this another letter to yourselfe from me, which Mr. Rawson
will give you, with that which your committee here for the college has sent
to the overseers. There is one Mr. Smith, I think his name is so, an expert
surveyor, who has built forty of these famous houses in London, though he be a
stranger to myself, yet has the commendations of eminent ministers for his
goodness, besides some of the chief workmen in the city for his ability in his
calling. If you make use of him about the college, you may do well to pay his
passage, or as you please; I have agreed with him for nothing, because he
desired to be left free.

Sir, there is another trouble which I presume to putt upon you, which is, to
speak to the reverend Mr. Higginson, pastor of Salem, to move that
congregation to do something for the maintenance of Mrs. Peter's, Widow of Hugh
Peter's.
who, since her husband suffered here, has depended wholly upon Mr. Cockquaine
and that church whereof he is pastor. I fear she will be forced to seek her
living in the streets, if some course be not taken for her relief, either by
Mr. Higginson or Mr. Oxenbridge, or some other sympathyzing minister. Sir, I
pray you, present my best respects to both of them. Little news here since my
last, which was directed to yourselfe. Here is great talk of the German
Emperor and the Sweeds joining with the Hollander. The treaty of peace at
Coligne is said to be broken up, our navy is going forth suddenly, it is
violently suspected that all our East India men are taken by the Dutch, and
some of our factoryes. The blessed God strengthen your heart and hand in that
great work which he has called you to. Thus my best respects unto yourselfe,
and good Mrs. Leverett, I commend you to God's blessing in Christ Jesus.

Sir, your faithful friend and servant, John Knowles.

Copy of a Letter from King Charles II. to the Governor and Council of the
Massachusetts Colony.
CHARLES R.

TRUSTY and well beloved, We greet you well. Whereas We have been given to
understand that you did in the month of October last, pass a law in your
assembly at Boston for the reviving and administering a certain oath of fidelity
to the country; and whereas the enjoining the said oath at such time, when you
had intimation by your agents here of our being displeased with the form
thereof, is highly disrespectfull to Us, and seems to be intended as a snare in
the way of many of our good subjects there, of whose preservation We shall ever
be tender; We have thought fit hereby to signify to you, that We take the
untimely renewing and enjoining of the said oath very ill, and that We look
upon the same as derogatory to our honor as well as defective in point of your
duty, inasmuch as the allegiance due to us, and the fidelity to the country are
joined together in the same undecent form, wherein such fidelity is made even
to precede your allegiance to us. And though We do not, for the present,
prescribe what form may be proper amongst your selves, as to your corporation
oath, yet We do hereby strictly require and command you to give order that the
oath of allegiance, as it is by law established in this Our kingdom of England,
a copy of which oath attested by one of Our principal secretaries of state you
will receive herewith enclosed) be administered unto and taken by all Our
subjects, inhabitants within that Our colony, who are of years to take an oath,
wherein We expect your entire obedience and utmost care, this being so
fundamental a concern to Our dignity and government, We could not omit any
longer to signify to you Our pleasure therein, though several other matters of
moment relating to that Our colony are still depending before Us, in which We
are not come to any final resolution. And so We bid you farewell. Given at Our
court at Whitehall, the 27th day of April 1678, in the thirtieth year of Our
Reign.

By his Majesty's command, Williamson.

Copy of a Petition and Address of the General Court of the Massachusetts to the
King.
To the King's most excellent Majesty. The humble petition and address of the
governor and company of your Majesty's colony of the Massachusetts in
New England,
Humbly shows,
THAT whereas your said petitioners have since your Majesty's most happy
restoration, upon their several addresses in the years 1661, 62, etc.
received many signal and gracious returns of favor (confirmation of our
charter, pardon of our errors, assurance of your royal inclination to promote
the trade and happiness of this plantation) proceeding only from your royal
goodness, which has highly obliged us to all due acknowledgments thereof, as
we have had opportunity; and we shall, in future, at no time omit to manifest
(according to our capacity) our hearty and sincere affection to your Majesty's
service and interest, as in duty we are bound: And therefore most humbly
implore the continuance of those gracious influences, whereby your poor
subjects here have been so much refreshed in their great sufferings and
distresses, and that your Majesty, according to your innate wisdom and
goodness, will receive no impressions from any that, for their own evil ends,
shall endeavor (by false or mistaken reports) to represent us as affecting and
aspiring to a greatness independent on your Majesty's sovereignty over us, or
incompatible with the duty of good and loyal subjects to a most gracious King,
in whose prosperity and happiness we most heartily rejoice and for which we
daily pray.

In humble obedience to your Majesty's command in 76, we dispatched our good
friends Mr. William Stoughton and Mr. P. Buckley, to attend your Majesty's
pleasure concerning the bounds of our patent, in reference to Mr. Gorges and
Mr. Mason, wherein, as we have been informed, your Majesty has declared your
pleasure as to the settlement of the bounds of our patent, and our right of
government therein according to our charter; which is matter of great
satisfaction to all your good subjects here, it being their utmost ambition to
enjoy, under your royal protection and allegiance, the known and declared ends
of the first undertakers, which has hitherto been carried on at their own
charge, both formerly and lately, defended by a greater expense of blood and
treasure than will easily be believed; whereof they cannot but desire to reap
the fruits, which they assure themselves they may, without any diminution of
your Majesty's greatness, dominion or glory, which, with your Majesty's pardon,
we are bold to affirm will not be advanced by any innovation or alteration of
our present settlement.

We humbly supplicate your Majesty that our messengers, having dispatched the
business betrusted with them by us and commanded to attend by your Majesty,
may be at liberty to return, and not be obliged to make answer to such
complaints as are made by unquiet spirits, who seek not your Majesty's but
their own advantages and our distress. And what shall be incumbent on us, we
shall with all dutifullness attend, as becomes good christians and loyal
English subjects, and shall glory in giving your Majesty all just
satisfaction, not insisting upon any errata that may have slipped us in 48
years, especially in our infancy, or in the times of the late confusions, for
which (as we have had) we again most humbly implore your Majesty's gracious
pardon, which will further oblige us for the future to be most observant of
your royal pleasure, as to your establishment of us according to the charter
granted by your royal father and confirmed by your royal self upon several
occasions.

Let your Majesty be pleased to accept from our messengers abovesaid an
account of our ready obedience to your Majesty's command for taking the oath of
allegiance in the form prescribed, and our repealing that law referring to the
oath, so ill resented by your Majesty, with some orders Mr. Attorney and Mr.
Solicitor excepted against, as our messengers have intimated. We might
recount the particulars and present our further desires, but fearing we have
been too tedious to detain your Majesty from your more important affairs,
and not being in a present capacity to manifest our gratitude by a suitable
acknowledgment of your constant goodness, by reason of the great desolations,
charges and debts contracted and yet remaining upon us by the late
insurrections and outrages of the Indians, we prostrate at your Majesty's
feet, and humbly beg the acceptance of the loyal hearts of your Majesty's most
humble subjects and suppliants,

The governor and company of the Massachusetts colony in New England.
The magistrates have past this address, their brethren the deputyes hereto
consenting. Edw. Rawson, Secr.
Boston 10 October. 1678. The deputyes consent hereto, William Torrey, Cleric.
Voted by the whole court met together, 16.8.78. as now it is amended, Edw.
Rawson, Secretary.

Copy of a Letter from King Charles II. to the Governor, etc. of the
Massachusetts.
CHARLES R.

TRUSTY and well beloved, We greet you well. These our letters are to
accompany our trusty and well beloved William Stoughton and Peter Bulkley,
Esqrs. your agents, who having manifested to us great necessity in their
domestic concerns to return back into New England, We have graciously
consented thereunto, and the rather because, for many months past, our council
has been taken up in the discovery and prosecution of a popish plott, and yet
there appears little prospect of any speedy leisure for entering upon such
regulation in your affairs as is certainly necessary, not only in respect of
our dignity but of your own perfect settlement. But it is very probable that
if either your said agents had brought commission to intermeddle in such
regulation (which they have disowned) or that you had sent such commission
after them, when, from time to time, intimations were given them of what we
did expect, and what we were thereupon willing to grant, neither their stay
had been thus long, nor had the matter now been undetermined. We must
therefore attend a further opportunity for this work and, in order thereunto,
our will and pleasure is, that you send out such other fit person or persons,
duly instructed, and send them in six months after the receipt of these our
letters, that they may here attend us in the prosecution of the same: For since
the charter, by its frame and contents, was originally to be executed in this
kingdom See Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 1^.
and not in New England, otherwise than by deputation (as is accordingly
practiced in all other charters of like nature) it is not possible to establish
that perfect settlement we so much desire, until these things are better
understood. In the mean time, we doubt not but the bearers hereof, who have
demeaned themselves, during their attendance, with good care and discretion,
will, from their own observations, acquaint you with many important things
which may be of such use and advertisement to you that we might well hope to be
prevented, by your applications, in what is expected or desired by us, so much
it is your interest to propose and intercede for the same; for we are
graciously inclined to have all past errors and mistakes forgotten, and that
your condition might be so amended as that neither your settlement, or the
minds of our good subjects there, should be liable to be shaken and disquieted
upon every complaint. We have heard, with satisfaction, of the great readiness
wherewith our good subjects there have lately offered themselves to the taking
of the oath of allegiance, which is a clear minifestation to us that the
unanswerable defect in that particular was but the fault of a very few in
power, who for so long a time obstructed what the charter and our express
commands obliged them unto, as will appear in our gracious letters of the 28th
of June, in the fourteenth year of our reign; and we shall henceforth expect
that there will be a suitable obedience in other particulars of the said
letter, as namely, in respect of freedom and liberty of conscience, so as those
that desire to serve God, in the way of the church of England, be not thereby
made obnoxious or discountenanced from their sharing in the government, much
less that they or any other of our good subjects (not being Papists) who do
not agree in the congregationall way, be by law subjected to fines or
forfeitures, or other incapacities, for the same; which is a severity to be the
more wondered at, when as liberty of conscience was made one principal motive
for your first transportation into those parts; nor do we think it fit that
any other distinction be observed in the making of freemen, than that they be
men of competent estates, rateable at ten shillings, They seem to have held out
till the last in refusing to admit any to be freemen who were not, either
church members or who did not, at least, obtain a certificate from the minister
of the town that they were orthodox, of good lives, etc.
according to the rules of the place, and that such, in their turns, be also
capable of the magistracy, and all laws made void that obstruct the same. And
because we have not observed any fruits or advantage by the dispensation
granted by us in our said letters of June in the fourteenth year of our reign,
whereby the number of assistants, settled by our charter to be eighteen, might
be reduced unto the number of tenn, our will and pleasure is, that the ancient
number of eighteen be henceforth observed, according to the letter of the
charter. And our further will and pleasure is, that all persons coming to any
priveledge, trust, or office in that colony, be first enjoined to take the oath
of allegiance, and that all the military commssions as well as the proceedings
of justice may run in our royal name. We are informed that you have lately
made some good provision for observing the acts of trade and navigation, which
is well pleasing unto us. This is very extraordinary, for this provision was an
act of the colony declaring that the acts of trade should be in force there.
Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 322.
And as we doubt not and do expect that you will abolish all laws that are
repugnant to and inconsistent with the laws of trade with us, We have
appointed our trusty and wellbeloved subject Edward Randolph, Esquire to be our
collector, surveyor and searcher, not only for that colony, but for all other
our colonies in New England, constituting him, by the broad seal of this our
kingdom, to the said employments, and therefore recommending him to your help
and assistance in all things that may be requisite in the discharge of his
trust.

There is one thing which we cannot omit to let you know we are surprised at,
which is, that during the time we had the complaints of Mr. Gorges under our
consideration, you should presume, without asking our royal permission, to
purchase his interest in the province of Maine, the truth whereof is but lately
owned by your said agents, when almost at the same time we come to hear of
some effects of a severe hand laid by you on our subjects there in consequence
thereof. And whereas your agents declare you have paid to Mr. Gorges the sum
of twelve hundred pounds for the said province, we do expect, that upon our
reimbursement of what it shall appear you have paid for the same, that there
be a surrender of all deeds and writings thereof made into our hands, and that
your future agents do bring them over, forasmuch as we were sometime in treaty
for the said province and do disapprove what you have done therein. And as for
that part of the province of New Hampshire lying three miles northward of
Merimack river, which was granted unto Mr. Mason, and whereof the government
remains still vested in us, you are not to expect (according to the desire of
your agents) that the same should be annexed to your government, for we have
it under our consideration to establish such method there as may be of most
benefit and satisfaction to the people of that place. And therefore our will
and pleasure is, that you do recall all commissions granted by you for the
governing within that province, which we do hereby declare to be void, and do
require that you do in all things for the future conform yourselves unto the
regulation which we have taken in this behalf. And so not doubting of your
duty and obedience herein, we bid you farewell. Given at our palace of
Hampton Court the 24th day of July 1679, and in the one and thirtieth year of
our reign.

By his Majesty's command, A. Coventry.

Copy of a Letter from King Charles II. to the Governor and Council of the
Massachusetts Colony.
CHARLES R.

TRUSTY and well beloved, we greet you well. When by our royal letters
bearing date the 24th day of July in the one and thirtieth year of our reign,
we signified unto you our gracious inclination to have all past deeds
forgotten, setting before you the means whereby you might deserve our pardon,
and commanding your ready obedience to several particulars therein contained,
requiring, withal, a speedy compliance with the intimations of your duty given
to your late agents, during their attendance here, all which we esteem
essential to your quiet settlement and natural obedience due unto us; we
then little thought that those marks of our grace and favor should have found
no better acceptance amoung you, but that, before all things, you should have
given preference to the execution of all our commands, when after so many
months we come to understand by a letter from you to one of our principal
secretaries of state dated the 21st of May last, that very few of our
directions had been pursued by your general court, the further consideration
of the remaining particulars having been put off upon insufficient pretenses,
and even wholly neglecting your appointment of other agents which were required
to be sent over unto us within six months after the receipt of our said
letters, with full instructions to attend our royal pleasure herein in
relation to that our government. We have also received the petition of our
trusty and well beloved Robert Mason, Esquire whose ancestors obtained diverse
grants and made large purchases of lands in New England, humbly laying before
us the state of his further pretensions to the propriety of soil in a tract of
land lying between Merrimack and Nahinkeke rivers, by virtue of a grant bearing
date in the nineteeeth year of the reign of our royal grandfather, in the
examination whereof the lords of our committee of foreign plantations had made
such a progress that the right of our subjects had been thereupon settled,
without the humble entreaty of your said agents, and the consent of the said
Robert Mason, that in regard of their sudden departure and want of power in
that behalf, the determination thereof might be suspended until the arrival
of other agents to be appointed according to the limitation of our aforesaid
letters, as your agents were able to inform you. And although the vindication
of our authority, and the demand of justice from one of our subjects, might
have well induced to the most speedy means of redress, by doing us and our
subjects right; We have nevertheless continued our royal clemency toward
you and thought fit to give you further opportunity of bearing evidence of
your duty toward us; so as no further occasion of complaint may be offered in
respect of your behavior. We do therefore, by these our letters, strictly
command and require you, as you tender your allegiance unto us, and will
deserve the effects of our grace and favor (which we are enclyned to afford
you) seriously to reflect upon our commands contained in our said letters, and
other directions, at several times, intimated unto your late agents, while
they were yet attending our council; and particularly we do hereby command
you to send over, within three months after the receipt hereof, such other
person or persons as you shall think fit to choose, and that you give them
sufficient instructions to attend the regulation and settlement of that our
government, and to answer your proceedings therein, and, that the matter of the
complaints of the said Robert Mason may be then determined, we expect that
your agent or agents be not only prepared to lay before us such evidences of
right as you may have to the propriety of soil in that tract of land claymed
by him, but we direct you also to make a public signification of our pleasure
unto all the inhabitants and tertennants thereof, that they do furnish at the
same time your said agents, or such others as they may depute, with the proofs
of their respective titles to the land possessed by them, to the end they may
be fully sattisfied in our royal justice, that they have not binn prevented in
the full improvement of their lawful defense, which we hereby direct them to
make before us in council. Such is the care and tenderness that we will
always continue toward you and other our subjects, by removing those
difficulties and mistakes that have arisen by the execution of the powers of
your charter at such a distance from us, which by the first intendment and
present constitution thereof (as by the charter appears) has its natural seat
and immediate direction within our kingdom of England, and that the due
observance of all our commands abovementioned may not be any longer
protracted, we require you, upon the receipt hereof, forthwith to call a
general court, and therein to read these our letters and provide for our
speedy sattisfaction; in default whereof, we shall take the most effectual
means to procure the same. And so we bid you farewell. Given at our court at
Newmarket, the 30th of September 1680, in the two and thirtieth year of our
reign.

Copy of Mr. Randolph's Representation of the Bostoneers, 1680.
To the Kings most excellent Majesty, The humble representation of Edw.
Randolph, Humbly shows,
THAT your Majesty was graciously pleased, in March 1675-6, to entrust him with
your royal letters to the governor of Boston in New England, and also commanded
him, upon several queries, to inform your Majesty of the present state of
that government.

In all humble obedience to your Majestyes royal command, he has reduced his
information to these following heads, viz.

1. That the Bostoneers have no right either to land or government in any part
of New England, but are usurpers, the inhabitants yielding obedience unto a
supposition only of a royal grant from his late Majesty.

2. They have formed themselves into a commonwealth, denying any appeals to
England, contrary to other plantations, do not take the oath of allegiance.

3. They have protected the murderers of your royal father, in contempt of
your Majestyes proclamation of the 6th June 1660, and your letter of 28th June
1662.

4. They coin money of their own impress.

5. They put your Majestyes subjects to death for religion.

6. In 1665, they did voyalantly oppose your Majestyes commissioners in the
settlement of New Hampshire. In the year 1666, by armed force, turned out your
Majestyes justices of peace in the province of Maine in opposition to your
Majestyes authority and declaration 10th April 1666.

7. They impose an oath of fidelity upon those that inhabit within their
territories to be true and faithful to their government.

8. They violate all the acts of trade and navigation, by which they have
engrossed the greatest part of the West India trade, whereby your Majesty is
damnified in the customs L. 100000 yearly, and the kingdom much more.

All which he is ready to prove.

Copy of Edward Randolph's Articles of high Misdemeanor exhibited against the
General Court sitting 15th February 1681. Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 335.

Articles of high misdemeanour exhibited against a faction in the general
court, sitting in Boston, 15 Feb. 81. viz. against Tho. Danforth, Dan. Gookin,
Mr. Saltonstall, Sam. Nowell, Mr. Richards, Mr. Davy, Mr. Gidney, Mr. Appleton,
magistrates. And against John Fisher, Elisha Cook, Tho. Brattle, Anthony
Stodder, Bathurst, Hathorn, Wait, Johnson, Hutchinson, Sprague, Oaks,
Holbrook, Cushion, Hammond, Pike, deputys etc. By Edward Randolph, collector,
etc. of his Majesty's customs in New England.

I. THAT the said faction, the governor not consenting thereto, have refused to
publish his Majesty's proclamation of the 24th of November in the 23d year of
his reign, sent by his Majesty's special command, and received by this
government in October 1680, which enforces the act made in 25th year of his
Majesty's reign.

II. The said faction have refused to declare and admit of his Majesty's
letters pattents bearing date at Westminster 15th October, in the 33d year of
his reign, erecting an office of collector, etc. of his Majesty's customs in
New England, and of the powers granted to his Majesty's officer by the same,
though often pressed thereunto, in the general court, by the governor, Major
Dudley and several of the magistrates of the colony.

III. The said faction have refused to pay me several sums of money which I
was forced to deposit in court before I could proceed to trial of causes
relating to his Majesty's concerns, by virtue of an order of court made October
1. 1681, no law of this colony directing the same, though by his Majesty's
royal letters of October. 21. 1681, they are particularly required thereunto.

IV. The said faction, under pretense of satisfaction of his Majesty and
regulating the trade of this colony, in opposition to the said officer of
collector of his Majesty's customs, have confirmed the place and powers of the
collector of the customs and imposts laid upon wines and strong waters imported
into their colony, set up by a law made in their colony in 1645, their present
navall officer, having been chief collector of these duties above a year
before this navall office was ordered, as by their law, navall office, does
appear.

V. The said faction continue to exercise the power of governor and court of
assistants, which, through the inadvertency of former governors, the court of
deputyes have assumed, to hear, repeal and determine in civil causes, which,
for want of education and being under no particular oath, they are incapable to
manage: so that by their numbers outvoting the governor and court of
assistants, his Majesty's subjects greatly suffer in their estates, and
besides, there is no such power granted them in their charter.

VI. The said faction have neglected to repeal all laws of their colony
contrary to the laws of England, though required thereunto by his Majesty's
letters of 28th of Feb. 1662, and the observance thereof promised by their
agents at that time; and also by particular direction from the right honorable
the Lords of the committee of trade and plantation to their late agents in
1678, by which means coining of money (acknowledged in their agents petition
to his Majesty a great crime and misdemeanor, who then craved his Majesty's
pardon to the government for the same) is continued to this day, etc. Also
their laws ecclesiastical continued, etc.

VII. The said faction have refused to admit of his Majesty's letters pattents
beating date at Westminster 19th of May in the 32d year of his Majesty's reign,
granted to William Blathwait, Esquire erecting an office of surveyor and auditor
general of his Majesty's revenues arising in America, and do appropriate to
themselves the fines, forfeitures, etc. which appear by the said letters
pattents to belong to his Majesty, and they make the condition of all
recognizances and penal bonds payable to the treasurer and not to the King.

Copy of a Letter from the General Court to Sir Lyonell Jenkins, one of his
Majesty's principal Secretaries of State.
Right honorable,
HIS Majesty's great goodness and favor in giving us a farther opportunity to
attend him in the affairs of this his colonie expressed in his gracious letter
of (...) we with most humble thankfulness acknowledge. And that we may not be
reflected upon as those that make very unsuitable returns thereunto, we have
taken the boldness to trouble your honor with the following account of our
proceedings; whereby we hope so great an infelicity may be prevented, and
which though it may seem late, yet is by the first from hence, except one
ready to sail, when his Majesty's commands were received by us.

Upon the receipt of his Majesty's said letter (though at a season, in regard
of the extremity of the cold and snow, very difficult for the members,
especially those remote, to assemble in) the governor forthwith summoned a
general court; which being met January 4th and his Majesty's letter
communicated with all duty and regard, the contents thereof were taken into
serious consideracion.

And, in the first place, we applied ourselves to the choice of agents that
they might have timely notice and, accordingly, so prepare themselves for that
service as to be ready to imbarque upon the first opportunity.

We considered of instructions for them, we carefully perused our whole book
of laws, pursuant to the exceptions made to some of them by Mr. Atturny and
Solicitor general when our late agents were attending his Majesty and their
information given us, since their return home, wherein we have made a
considerable progress toward a conclusion.

But so it is, right honorable, that we find it no easy matter to prevail
with persons, in any degree qualifyed, to undertake such a voyage at this time;
and though several elections have been made, we have not as yet obtained the
consent of any.

The present calamity of others of this country, now slaves in Algier (and one
of them an agent from one of his Majesty's colonies here) not yet ransomed,
does greatly discourage, especially such as live in good credit and condition.

And truly, Sir, should persons under such a character be taken, we have cause
to believe their ransom would be so high as that it would be hard for us to
procure it amongst a poor people yet laboring under the burden of the
arreares of our late war with the Indians and other extraordinary charges not
yet defrayed.

Sir, We do not urge this as that which has kept us from our duty, but only
as an inconvenience that meets us in the discharge of it.

We do not take ourselves to be disobliged; we have not departed from our
resolutions: But hope the premises considered (without mentioning other ill
circumstances which we are attended with in this affair) that the lapse of
time will not be reflected upon as proceeding from the want of loyalty and
allegiance in us, which we humbly profess that we will always bear to his
most sacred Majesty: And will the rather hope for his Majesty's pardon herein,
for that we understand his Majesty's time is yet taken up in those weighty
affairs (especially relating to the horrid and execrable popish plot) which
were the chief occasion of his dismission of our former agents. So that we
have ground to fear that our attendance at present may be troublesome to his
Majesty and unprofitable to ourselves.

Right honorable, We humbly pray that this our address may be accepted and
taken in good part by your honor, and that you will please to favor us, his
Majesty's most dutiful and obedient subjects, with the representation of our
present condition herein contained; that we may not incur his Majesty's
displeasure, nor be thought regardlesse of his commands, whereunto we have
been assembled in general court, endeavoring to give evidence of our obedience.

Herein you will forever oblige to pray for your happiness.

Dated in Boston in New England, 3d June 1681. Right Honorable, Your most
humble servants.
And was directed, To the Right Honorable Sir Lyonell Jenkins, one of his
Majestyes principal Secretarys of State. These humbly present.

Agreed by the committee, that this letter be directed to Sir Lionel Jenkins,
one of his Majesty's principal secretarys of state.

The deputyes do aprove of this return desiring our honnoured magistrates to
consent unto it.

Richard Sprague, per order. Consented to by the magistrates, Edw. Rawson,
Secretary.

Copy of a Letter from Edward Randolph to the Bishop of London.
My Lord,
IN my attendance on your Lordship, I often expressed that some able ministers
might be appointed to perform the officies of the church with us. The maine
obstacle was, how they should be mainetayned. I did formerly, and do now
propose, that a part of that money sent over hither and pretended to be
expended amongst the Indians, may be ordered to go toward that charge. I am
told by credible persons that there is nigh two thousand pounds of that money
put out to interest in this country, I know two hundred has bin for many
years in the hands of Mr. Rawson, their secretary, who is now pressed for to
pay the money, to his utter ruin. Necessity, and not duty, has obliged this
government to send over two agents to England; they are like to the two consuls
of Rome, Caesar and Bibulus. Major Dudley is a great opposer of the faction
here, against which I have now articled to his Majesty, who, if he finds
things resolutely manniged, will cringe and bow to any thing; he has his
fortune to make in the world, and if his Majesty, upon alteration of the
government, make him captain of the castle of Boston and the forts in the
colloney, his Majesty will gain a popular man and obleidge the better party.

But if, whatever I have said and proved against, and even confessed by their
former agents, their money raised upon the miserable inhabitants shall still
prove a prevailing argument, and the agents be dismissed before every matter
concluded in England be certified to be duly and punctually observed here,
you will render them more capable to oppose his Majestys authority.

I have reason, from such great pressing reasons to pay in this 200 l. to
believe that this money is a bank laid up here upon mannaging some public
design. There was a great difference betwixt the old church and the members of
the newchurch, about baptism and their members joining in full communion with
either church; this was so high that there was imprisoning of parties and
great disturbances, but now, heereing of my proposals for ministers to be sent
over, for they have very good correspondancy with some of the clarks of the
council, they are now joined together, about a fortnight ago, and pray to God
to confound the devices of all who disturb their peace and liberties. I have
made it an article against them, for not repealing their laws ecclesiastical,
and sent in my papers to Mr. Blackworth a large account of their latter
transactions, to which I humbly beseech your Lordship to be referred and to be
present at the committys making a party against their great friend L. P. S. who
cannot withstand their weighty arguments. They have bin this 3 years raising
money for this expedition, their last agents expended above 4000 l. in their
agency, the poor people must pay all, for by their law neither magistrates,
ministers or any public officers are charged with any public rate. These
agents have certainly one great advantage by my absence, having liberty to say
what they please; but I think I have so clearly laid down the matter of fact,
sent over their laws and orders to confirm what I have wrote, that they
cannot deny them; however, if commanded, I will readily pass the seas to attend
at Whitehall, especially if Danford, Goggin and Newell, majestrates, and Cook,
Hutchinson and Fisher, members of their late general court and great opposers
of the honest governor and majestrates, be sent for to appear before his
Majesty, till which time this country will always be a shame as well as
inconveniency to the government at home. Your Lordship has a great pledge for
such ministers as your Lordship shall think convenient to send over, for their
civell treatment, and I think no person sitter than Major Dudley, their agent,
to accompany them, who will be very careful to have them settled as ordered in
England. He is one of the commissioners for the money sent over for the
converting the Indians; I give him two or three lines to recommend him to your
Lordships favor, so far as he may be serviceable to the design; as for
Capt. Richards, he is one of the faction, a man of mean extraction, coming
over a poor servant, as most of the faction were at their first planting
here, but by extraordinary feats and coussinadge have got them great estates
in land, especially Danford, so that if his Majesty do fine them sufficiently,
and well if they escape so, they can go to work for more. As for Mr.
Richards, he ought to be kept very safe till all things tending to the quiett
and regulation of this government be perfectly settled. I give your Lordship my
humble thanks for the great present of excellent books. I have disposed of
them to advantage and, with my wife, are cried out upon as disturbers of the
peace of the churches, for bringing in damnable books. We have in Boston one
Mr. Willard, a minister, brother to Major Dudley, he is a moderate man and
baptiseth chose who are refused by the other churches, for which he is hated.
My Lord, we here the slaves in Algier are all to be redeemed, that I bouldly
write itt that the settlement of this country and putting the government into
the hands of honest gentlemen, some or which are already in the majestracy, and
discountenancing utterly the faction, will be more grateful to us, for now our
conciences as well as our bodies are in captivity to servants and illiterate
planters. My Lord, your goodness and readiness to serve his Majesty in the
settlement of this great plantation, invites me, upon all occasions, to
interpose your Lordships more weighty affairs, but since we are here
immediately under your Lordships care, I with more freedom press for able and
sober ministers, and we will contribute largely to their maintenance, but one
thing will mainely help, when no marriages hereafter shall be allowed lawful
but such as are made by the ministers of the church of England. I humbly crave
your Lordships blessing and remain

Your Lordships most obedient servant, Ed. Randolph.
1682 May 29th. My Lord, I cannott forgett that the Lords of the committee for
trade moved his Majesty to add to my sallery of 200 l. a year, the yearly
sum of one hundred more for my incouradgment. I have a great fammyly to
maintain, have had great losses and expenses about his Majesty's service
here, all which, I hope, will be taken into consideration; for if his Majesty
be now resolute, I question not, but without aney further charge to his
Majesty, the whole settlement of the country will be effected.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to the Earl of Clarendon.
Boston, June 14th, 1682. Right honorable,
I Wrote your Lordship largely by Mr. Foy, which I hope is come to your
Lordships hands. Our agents are sailed from hence about a fortnight ago. We
hear, Maj. Dudley, one of them, is very sick of a feavor and not like to hold
out the voyage, Mr. Richards, the other, one of Danforths faction and a great
opposer of the governor, will, upon Maj. Dudleys death, have an opportunity to
say what he pleases, in defense of the several misdemeanors objected against
them and their faction.

They have been these 2 years raising money upon the poor inhabitants, to
make friends at court, certainly they have some there, too nigh the council
chamber, otherwise they could not have coppies of my petition against their
government, my articles of high misdemeanures against Danforth, and now of Mr.
Cranfields instructions and negotiations in the province of New Hampshire.

I heartily congratulate the happy return of his Royal H. my gracious master,
to Whitehall, the news whereof and of his Majesty's bringing quo warrantos
against several charters in England, and of Mr. Cranfields being constituted
governor of New Hampshire, puts the faction in a great perplexity; their
general court has set above a month, and made only the enclosed law, and
appointed a fast throughout the government. I am confident, if his Majesty had
been pleased, at the same time he made Mr. Cranfield governor, to bring a Q. W.
against their charter and made him governor of this collonie, they would
thanckfully receive him, especially upon declaring liberty of conscience in
matters of religion; but so long as their charter remains undisturbed, all his
Majesty says or commands signifies nothing here. The governor is very much
troubled that the faction will not hearken to reason; he endeavored to have
their navall office (set up in opposition to my letters pattents) taken away
this general court, and have all the acts of parliament relating to trade
declared and published, but the faction are resolved to do nothing to oblige
the governor or answer his Majesty's expectations. His Majesty's quo warranto
against their charter and sending for Tho. Danforth, Sam. Nowell, a late
factious preacher and now a magistrate, and Dan. Fisher and Elisha Cook,
deputies, to attend and answer the articles of high misdemeanures I have now
exhibited against them, in my papers sent Mr. Blaithwait per Capt. Foy, will
make the whole faction tremble. I was very much threatened for my protest
against their navall office, but it was at a time when they heard of troubles
in England; but, since, I am very easy, and they would be glad to hear no more
of it. His Majesty commanded them to repay me the money they took from me by
their arbitrary orders, which the faction would not hear of, I have therefore
arrested Mr. Danforth for 10 l. part of that money, and their treasurer, Mr.
Russell, for 5 l. due to me for a fine, and I am to have a trial with them. I
humbly beseech your Lordship that I may have coesideration for all my losses
and money laid out in prosecuting seizures here, in the year 1680. If I may not
have it out of his Majesty's treasury in England, that the heads of this
faction here may be strictly prosecuted and fined for their treasons and
misdemeanures, and my money paid out of their fines. My Lord, I am at a great
disadvantage, by reason of my distance from court, and in no condition to
solicit his Majesty's concerns and the good and welfare of this colony, as
formerly, I well remember, business with your Lordship, as with other Lords of
the council, sometimes intervenes, which has occasioned not only delays but
quite alters the face of things, especially when a committee of Lords meet,
who are not acquainted with the whole series of this affair: It is therefore
my humble request to your Lordship to move that 2 or 3 committyes may be
appointed for this matter, when your Lordship, my Lord Hide, and Mr. Chancellor
of the Exchequer, may be present, and the whole matter of fact examined and
stated. I know the agents, at least one of them, will confess what is charged
upon their government, as their former agents did, in their petition to his
Majesty, which is a standing evidence against them; but if that be not
sufficient ground to avoid their charter, together with the misdemeanors
charged upon them, on which your Lordship has the opinion of Sir Wm. Jones, if
his Majesty please to direct Gov. Cranfield to examine the last articles
against the faction, there will be reason not only to vacate their charter but
to send over a prudent gentleman to be general governor. If the party were so
considerable as to revolt, upon his Majesty's resolution to settle this
plantation (as has been sometime suggested) their first work would be to call
me to account, for endeavoring, openly, the alteration of their constitution,
which by their law is death, but they dwindle away and are very much divided,
magistrate against magistrate, the one hoping, the other fearing a change. My
Lord, I have but one thing to reminde your Lordship, that nothing their agents
can say or do in England can be any ground for his Majesty to depend upon: Be
pleased to remember, from the time your Lordships honorable father, the late
Lord Chancellor, engaged with their agents, in 1662, who undertook and
assented to every thing his Lordship proposed for his Majesty's honor and the
benefit of his subjects here inhabiting, nothing but open contempt, of all his
Majesty's commands, with small evasions and tricks, have followed, and worse
may be daily expected, if it be left to them to regulate the abuses complained
of. My Lord, one unhappy (if not wilful) mistake has very much promoted
these mischiefs, his Majesty has been represented to this people very low in
his treasury, unable and unwilling to give them any disturbance, though never
so much provoked to it, which is here believed, when to this day their
contempts putt upon his Majesty's commission and commissioners in 1664, his
Majesty not calling them to account for refusing to send over Bellingham and
Hathorne, when commanded upon their allegiance to attend at Whitehall by his
Majesty's letter of 1666, no not so much as the least notice taken of it in any
of his Majesty's letters at any time since to this government, and on the other
hand, by a certain deceptio visus, these people have been represented to his
Majesty as a very dutiful and loyal people, that they are a great people and
can raise great forces, besides that they have been at vast charges and
expenses in subduing a wilderness and making a great country, without any
charge or expense to the crown. Its true there are many loyal subjects here,
but few of them in any places of trust. Their forces are very inconsiderable,
more for show than service. I will engage with 500 of his Majesty's guards to
drive them out of their country. And for their expenses, I know very few now
living, nor their children, who were at that charge. Mr. Dudley, one of the
present agents, was one of the first planters and a gentleman, came over with a
good estate, but the first adventurers are either all dead and their children
drove out of all, by their fathers servants, or else so few and inconsiderable
that no notice is taken of them; and as for all the persons joined and
concerned in the faction here, I know but one man who was not a servant or a
servants son, who now govern their governor and the whole country. This is a
scandalous misrepresentation, unless he intended to save himself by supposing
the governor and the whole country to be governed by a few, only, of those
against whom he had just before exhibited articles of high misdemeanor.
I beseech your Lordship to pardon my long New England discourse, and believe
me, in all this, to aim at his Majesty's honor and the good of this
plantation, where, by his Majesty's goodness and your Lordships favor, I am
now become an inhabitant, and remain

E. R.
My Lord, After your Lordship has perused the enclosed, if any thing occurr
therein which may be of service, whilst the affairs of this colony are
transacting, be pleased to send it to Mr. Blaithwait, that the necessaries may
be communicated, if required. In the enclosed law, they call the money coined
in this colony. New England coin, engageing the whole plantation in the matter
of their mint and thereby bespeaking the influence this small government would
have over all the neighboring colonys, but their ambition will show itself
upon all occasions; however, if they cannot conceal what they aim at, lying
under such circumstances, they will take a time effectually to demonstrate what
they have been for many years, designing, that is, the general government
over the whole plantation, which, indeed, is absolutely necessary on his
Majesty's behalf, but not to be managed by them.

E. Randolph.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Randolph to the Lord Bishop of London.
Boston, July 14th 1682. My Lord,
I Gave your Lordship the trouble of mine of 29th of May last, which I hope is
long since received. We have advice by Capt. Barrett, now arrived from London,
that your lordship has remembered us, and sent over a minister with Mr.
Cranfield, the very report has given great satisfaction to many hundreds whose
children are not baptized, and to as many who never, since they came out of
England, received the sacrament. I wrote your lordship of our two agents coming
over to attend and receive his Majesty's commands, they have large commissions
to promise as much as any of their former agents, and have credit for large
sumes of money to purchase (if they can) what their promises cannot obtain,
but I hope nothing will be concluded upon, and they thereupon permitted to
return home, till his Majesty have full assurance from governor Cranfield
that all things are here duly performed which are expected and commanded to be
done in this collonie. But nothing will so effectually settle this government
on a firm dependence upon the crown as bringing a quo warranto against their
charter, which will wholly disinable many, now, great sticklers and promoters
of the faction among us from acting further in a public station, especially
those against whom I have exhibited the enclosed articles sent in my last to
Mr. Blathwait.

My Lord, I am at a great distance and so not able personally to attend and
solicit in this affair as formerly, but in regard the matter is more easy to
be effected, I think it unnecessary, yet in regard its absolutely necessary
for his Majesty's service and advantage to the crown to have the whole
plantation settled upon the true basis of duty and allegiance, I had rather
take a voyage to England, if commanded, to make out my allegations, than to
have this matter passed over and hursht up upon bare pretenses and promises. I
confess my particular business is to take care of the trade of this country,
I daily expose myself to many hazards and troubles, but all I have done or can
project is to little purpose, so long as this government (now sufficiently
divided) which the laws of England enjoyne to my aid and assistance, are
parties and chief obstructers of my designs, for till this government be
thoroughly regulated, all that his Majesty commands will signify nothing. This
independency in government claimed and daily practiced by us is one chief
occasion of the many mutinies and disturbances in other his Majesty's foreign
plantations. If we are misinformed concerning your lordship's sending over a
minister, be pleased to commiserate our condition, and send us over a sober
discreet gentleman. Your lordship has now good security, so long as their
agents are in England, for his civil treatment by the contrary party; he will
be received by all honest men with hearty christian respects and kindness, and
if his Majesty's laws (as none but fanatics question) be of force with us,
we could raise a sufficient maintenance for diverse ministers out of the
estates of those whose treasons have forfeited them to his Majesty. I have
wrote to the Earl of Clarendon, to Mr. secretary Jenkins, to remind them of the
many small evasions and tricks putt upon his Majesty and the lords of the
council by this inconsiderable faction, whose so long delayed punishment and
reformation, invites and incourageth to greater contempts. I question not but
your lordships unspotted loyalty to his Majesty, and charity to us his
dutiful subjects, will now engage your lordship timely and vigorously to
assist, so to reduce this faction, as to put it absolutely out of their power
to attempt the like for the future. Our ministers hope God will support them in
all their extravagancies, and now we have a sollemne fast ordered to entreat
the Lord to give our agents favor in the eyes of the King, and with all they
are to be concerned. Sergeant Maynard, his Majesty's sergeant at law, has made
a present of eight chests of books, now sent over to the college at Cambridge,
by Capt. Barrett, and consigned them to Capt. Richards, one of the agents sent
to England. They are valued at above 400 l. I find his marrying Mr. Bantries
niece will oblige him to stand up for the good old cause, and to assist the
agents, who amongst other matters, are to represent me as an enemy to this
government, and an open disturber of their peace. I heartily beg your lordships
blessing, and remain,

E. R.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Randolph to Mr. Joseph Dudley.
Sir,
I Have yours of Sept. 10th by me and am now to give you the news of your
charter being vacated, by judgment, for nonappearance. His Majesty has chosen
Coll. Kerke, late governor of Tangier, to be your governor. He is a gentleman
of very good resolution and, I believe, will not fail in any part of his duty
to his Majesty nor be wanting to do all good offices for your distracted
colony, if, at last, they will hear what is reason and be governed. Here was
sent over a most scandilous paper, preached, as it is said, by Mr. Moody and Mr.
Mather; the Duke of York has a copy of it, and others have coppies also;
twill do your country great prejudice and put jealousies into the mind of the
council here, as if the collony would not abide by the judgment against their
charter, but stand up to defend their liberties. My business has been and shall
be to ward off as much as I can. And if, by the iniquity and folly of your
ministers and majestrates, you fail of what was expected, the whole blame will
rest upon themselves. The King sent me over to Holland, to inquire after the
irregular traders; 3 or 4 had been there, and they were gone before my coming.
I returned back a fortnight after judgment was given and would have been glad
to have seen Sir Edmund Andrews in England, who is yet in Guernsey. I question
not but you will have reports, as if a great fleet of ships, with regements of
horse and foot, are coming against you, but I know of no such thing, only, I
believe, a frigott or two will attend the governor, who is leftenant of one of
his Majesty's regiments of guards and one of the bed chamber. I remember what
you advise, that the government be, in the first place, transposed and
committed to the care of fitting persons upon the place to prepare and
accommodate affairs against the arrival of the governor. I am not wanting to
press for liberty of conscience and confirmation of all your rights and
possessions, and have nominated, according to what was agreed betwixt you and
myself, persons for the council, and dissuade all I can from raising any
rates upon the peo-to support government, more than what has been usual with
you. The King has been pleased to make me secretary and register of
New England. I have nominated you for the King's receiver general of all
New England, which will be a place of profit. I had other things to propose on
your behalf, but that must attend a farther opportunity. Respects to the
governor and his lady, madam Tailor, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Bulkeley, Mr. Page and
his lady, and all friends. Its yet very uncertain whether process will issue
out against Rhode Island and Connecticut collony to bring in both them before
the governor come over, or to do that afterward in case they refuse to submit
to a general governor, as yet nothing has been discovered of it. A committee
of Lords but saturday next is appointed for that business. Dr. Cox is well and
so is Mr. Boil and all your friends, amongst whom I desire to be recorded,
because I am Sir,

Your faithful friend, and engaged servant, etc.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Randolph to the Right Hon. the Lords of the
Committee for Trade and foreign Plantations.
July 28. 1686. May it please your Lordships,
PURSUANT to his Majestyes order in council of the 13th July 1685, directing
Mr. Attorney General to cause writs of Quo Warranto to be brought against the
charters of the colonys of Rhode Island and Connecticot in New England, I
accordingly served these writts, though by a tedious passage of almost 6 months
from London to this place, the time of their return was lapsed. However, the
governor of Connecticott, upon my delivering the writ to him at Harford, on
21st instant, has appointed a meeting of the general court of that colony to
be called together to surrender their charter to his Majesty, if not persuaded
by the factious people (who are unwilling to depend on his Majesty's favor) to
stand a trial, only to gain time and delay his Majesty's sending over a
general. Upon my delivering the governor of R. Island the summons of the
writ, he assembled the freemen, and they have drawn a petition and address to
be forthwith humbly presented to his Majesty.

I intended, long before this time, humbly to lay before your Lordships a more
early account of the present state of this government, but have forbore, to
wait the effect his Majesty's gracious commission and constitution of
government, containing liberty of conscience, would have upon the people of
this colony, which, at my first arrival, was received with all outward show of
satisfaction and a compliment of gratitude was returned his Majesty for that
favor; but since, the proceeding of the governor and council, whatever they
write or pretend in their letters to their Lordships, are managed to the
encouragement of the independent faction and utter discountenancing both the
minister and these gentlemen and others who dare openly profess themselves to
be of the church of England, not making any allowance for our minister, more
than we raise by contribution amongst ourselves. The frame of this government,
only, is changed, for our independent ministers flourish, and expect to be
advised with in public affairs. I need no further arguments to confirm the
truth hereof to your Lordship than to say, but two of the present members of
the government, viz. Mr. Mason and myself, are members of the church of
England, that of above 60 officers in the militia of the whole government,
there are not above 2 captains, or 3 inferior officers, but are either church
members or such as constantly frequent those meetings, which makes
nonconformists from all places resort there. About 2 months ago Mr. Morton, an
excommunicated minister, came hither from Nuington green; he was welcomed by
our president and designed to be master-head of our college, but not daring to
proceed, at first, by such large steps, he is called to be minister at
Charlestowne, a very good liveing, and is ready at hand to be president of the
college.

Two brothers, of the name of Baylie, great and daring nonconformists at
Lymbrick in Ireland, have been here 2 years and well provided for. In the time
of Monmouths rebellion, most part of the ministers animated the people, saying
the time of their deliverance was at hand, and not one of them prayed for his
Majesty, nor would give credit to his Majesty's most gracious letter,
signifying the overthrow of the rebels. I humbly propose, as greatly for the
quiet and welfare of this plantation of New England, that no minister from
England be permitted to land without the license of the general governor, and
that he have power or license to restrain from preaching such as are already
upon the place. From all which it will appear very necessary that his Majesty
would be graciously pleased to send over to us a general governor, to unite
and settle this distracted country, and also to make good what is already begun
in this colony, the delay whereof may be of evil consequence and give way for
the factious people here to reassume the government, which they openly declare
they have not parted withal, but expect an opportunity to be restored.

And as to the discharge of that trust reposed in me, I humbly represent to
your Lordships, that under his Majesty's authority the president takes great
liberty to injoyne upon me in my station, and would not assist me to make a
seizure of a vessel in the harbor, which my officers were not permitted to
board. I am by all accounted the foul enemy of the country, having been for 11
years attending his Majesty's command in this affair, and by serving the
writts upon the other colonies, my life may be made very uneasy, unless his
Majesty shall be pleased graciously to recommend me to the care and protection
of his general governor, for whose speedy arrival all good men heartily pray.

All which is humbly submitted, by your Lordships most humble servant, E. R.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Randolph to Mr. Blaithwait.
Boston, July 28th, 1686. Sir,
ENCLOSED is a letter sent some time since from the government of Road Island,
they call it a surrender of their charter. I have since the receipt of it
called on them in my way to Hartford in Connecticott, the governor tells me
they will pass a surrender in fuller terms under the seal of their colony,
but are willing to have this sent. I was with the governor of Connecticott and
delivered to him the quo woranto. I suppose they intend not to stand it out,
our council have sent Major Pincheon and Capt. Winthrop to Hardford to
persuade them to accommodate the matter, so as they may be added to the
government here; how far that will prevail I know not; they are sensible of
Mr. Dudleyes encroachment on all and every side, and are unwilling to trust
him, and are strongly invited to come under New York, but it is more for the
public advantage to have that colony continued to us. Since my goeing to
Hartford, the president has so contrived the matter that Capt. George has
received above two hundred pounds money which legally belongs to me who, as
collector and informer, ought to be admitted to prosecute a ship laden with
Scotch goods, but its all as Capt. George pleases, the president and he carry
all as they please, to the great dissattisfaction of the members of the
council, that now instead of meeting to do public business, it is only to
quarrill and that in such heats that I fear it will occasion the desolving
this government. I am forced to moderate others passions (though I have most
cause to complain) and quietly to suffer my proffitts to be shared out amongst
others till Sir Edmund Andros come over; he is longed for by all sober men who
find themselves abused by the false president. Mr. Wharton is comeing over our
agent, I have offered Mr. Mason at least to be joined with him, but I think I
cannot get it to pass.

There will I fear be an eruption betwixt the French of Nova Scotia and our
people in Main and New Hampshire, occasioned by Capt. Palmer and Mr. West of
New York, who being at the fort of Pemmequid and having advice of a ship of
Piscattaqua which landed wine at Ponopscutt belonging, as they say, to Nova
Scotia, they by force went ashore and took of the wine: I referr you to the
enclosed, a copy of Mr. Palmers letter: The governor of New-Yorke I am told
has given them directions to claim all the land as far eastward as the River
St. Croix. We have sent to all places to warn our people and to the fishermen,
not to venture upon their coasts, least they be surprised, and made to answer
for damages done by strangers. Just now I have received a letter from my good
friend Mr. Chaplin, who acquaints me of your happy recovery from a dangerous
sickness, for which I return hearty thancks to allmighty God. Mr. Stoughton is
inclined to the nonconformist ministers, yet stands right to his Majestyes
interest. Mr. Usher is made a great criminal for informing against Moody and
Allin, who are stirring up the people to rebellion, he is a just honest man,
and will not see his Majestyes interest suffer. But we are over voted and
cannot help our selves till Sir Edmund come to regulate the matter. Sir, I am
under great difficultyes, and were it not for my engagement in the business of
the masts, I would once more make a journey over, for I am treated by Mr. Dudly
worse than by Mr. Danforth, yet all under the pretense of friendship, and is
angry that I do not believe him. Honest Major Buckly is quite tired out and can
hardly be persuaded to come to Boston. This is our present distracted
condition. We have only patience and our friends assistance to depend upon in
England for redress.

I remain, Sir, etc.

Sir, I am informed that the land whereon the wine was landed have been always
deemed to belong to the French and was the very place formerly belonging to Sir
Thomas Temple, and was delivered up to the French upon the articles of Breda by
Capt. Wibourne, by his Majesty's special command, in exchange for the English
plantation on St. Christophers and that done about the year 1667.

Sir, Some of the members of the council are of opinion that since the
constitution of this government is by a president and council, who united are
all but governor, that therefore they ought to have a proportionable share of
the profitt as well as the charge and burden, having not one penny comeing to
them as members of the council more then to any justice of the peace; some
stay here five or six weeks together and neglect their own business, and have
nothing to defrey their ordinary charges, besides loss of time, which they have
desired me to represent and pray your opinion thereupon, as also whether the
president is virtute officii the ordinary to grant administrations and to allow
the probate of wills, he producing no authority from his Majesty's lords of the
council, or from my lord of London.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to the Archbishop of Canterbury, 1686.
May it please your Grace,
I Have forborne riteing to your grace till I had been some time upon the
place, to see how the poor people here would demean themselves under this new
government. At my first arrival I met with outward expressions of joy and
satisfaction, and many seemed well pleased at the change, having been struck
with a panicke fear upon the aprihention of Colonel Kurcks coming hither to be
their governor; but finding a commission directed to a gentleman borne among
themselves, the then governor and company, growing hardy by their ministers,
began to persuade Mr. Dudlie not to except of his Majesty's commission to be
president, hoping thereby to continue the government among themselves: But that
faileing them, they adjourned the meeting of their general assembly to the
second of October next, and so broke up with hopes, that either some unhappie
accident in affairs of state at home, or by dissension raised by their
artifices among the members in this new government, they might prevail so far
as to dissolve this new constitution and then reassume the government, which to
accomplish they are solissitouse. I take leave humbly to remind, that when your
grace was present at a committee of the Lords and was therein pleased to move,
that one of their meeting houses in Boston should be ordered to be set apart
for the exercise of the religion according to the church of England, it was
then answered by some of those noble Lords who discorsed in their favor,
provided they might have liberty of concience in matters of religion, they
would voluntarily submit to have one of their three meeting housen to be
disposed of by the president and council, for that use. Since my arrival with
Mr. Ratcliffe, a sober man, recommended by my Lord of London to be our
minister; who, besides his Lordships fair testimonials, brought with him a
letter from the right honorable the Lords of the commit for trade and
foraine plantations to the president and council for their countenance and
incouridgement in the discharge of his office; yet it was a long time before they
took the least notice of him or his business; at last, though strongly opposed,
I got a little room in their town house, for such as were for the church of
England to assemble in, but found it so strait that we are forced now to make
use of the exchange for that purpose; where, to humor the people our minister
preaches twice a day and baptises all that come to him, some infants, some
adults persons; we are now come to have prayers every Wednesday and Friday
mornings on their exchange, and resolve not to be baffled by the great
affronts; some calling our minister Baals priest, and some of their menisters,
from the pulpit, calling our prayers leeks, garlic and trash. We have often
moved for an honorable maintenance for our menister; but they tell us those
that hire him must mainetaine him, as they maintain their own menisters, by
contribution. Of a president and eighteen members of the council, there is
only myself, since Mr Masons departure for England, that is of the church of
England, and it was never intended that that charge should be supported by
myself and some few others of our communion.

I humbly represent to your grace, that the three meeting houses in Boston
might pay twentey shillings a week, a piece, out of their contribution,
toward the defraieing our church charges; that sum being less per annum than
each of their ministers receive. We have yet necessity for another minister to
come over to us; for if any illness or indisposition happen to the present
incumbent, we have no man here to perform the office. I am not to forgit to
your grace the bank of money in the hands of the corporation for evangelizing
the Indians. Your grace was very desireous that that money might be inquired
after, and applied to build us a church and free schooll, that our youth might
be no longer poisoned with the sedissious principles of this country: I am told
that there is not less then two thousand pounds here, but adventure not to stir
the least in it, having all ready brought upon my self so many enemise, and to
all my crimes added this one as the greatest in bringing the letherdge and
cerimonise of the church of England to be observed amongst us, and this day is
a commencement at our collidge, which your grace was pleased to honor with a
present of the learned Hamonds works, that rich man: They are all at present
more taken up in putting in one Morton of Neventon-green, a rank independent, to
be their precident, than to show any respect which is due to your graceouse
present, and I cannot expect it should be otherwise till his Majesty shall be
pleased to send us a general governor from England.

Thus much relating to these affairs of our church, that of our state little
differs; most part of our chief officers, as justices of the peace, etc. are
congregationall men, and not above three church of England men; and not above
three church of England officers in the militia; so that in the maine I can
only assure your grace that the persons only and not the government is changed.

Now from all this, after so many hazards and difficulties which I have gone
throw in the prosecution of his Majesty's service in New England, I am, by
their maliciouse practices made very uneasy; and such persons who reap
particular advantages by the change of government hate me for accomplishing it,
and are making parties and factions to misrepresent me to his Majesty.
Amongst those many noble Lords of his Majesty's most honorable previe
council, who have all along countenanced and furthered my hearty designs to
serve his Majesty, Sir, there eminently appeared for me. I humbly pray, upon
all occasions, the continuance of your graceouse favor, by which I shall be
the better enabled to attend his Majesty's affairs here committed to my care,
and I shall remain in all duty your graces. This is a copy of one of Mr.
Randolph's letters, and I suppose the bad orthography is owing to the
transcriber, for the originals are, in that respect, not very exceptionable.


Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Boston in N. E. Octo. 27th 86. May it please your Grace,
I Have some time since humbly represented to your grace a necessity of having
a church built in Boston to receive those of the church of England. We have at
present 400 persons who are daily frequenters of our church, and as many more
would come over to us, but some being tradesmen, others of mechanic
professions, are threatened by the congregationall men to be arrested by their
creditors, or to be turned out of their work, if they offer to come to our
church; under such discouragements we lie at present, and are forced to
address your grace for relief.

I have taken care to inform myself how the money sent over hither for the
company of evangelizing Indeans in New England (for so by their pattent from
his late Majesty they are styled) is disposed of here. Here are 7 persons,
called commissioners or trustees, who have the sole manage of it; the chief of
which are Mr. Dudley, our president, a man of a base, servile and
antimonarchicall principle, Mr. Stoughton, of the old leaven, Mr Richards, a
man not to be trusted in public business, Mr. Hinkley, governor of New
Plymouth collony, a rigid independent, and others like to these. The poor
Indians (those who are called ministers) come and complain to Mr. Ratclieffe,
our minister, that they have nothing allowed them: We have spoken to the
commissioners to have some allowance for them; all we can get is the promise
of a coarse coat against winter, and would not suffer Aaron, an Indian teacher,
to have a bible with the common prayer in it, but took it away from him. This
money is not less than 3 or 400 l. which is yearly returned over hither (some
say 600) with which they enrich themselves, yet charge it all as laid out among
the poor Indians. I humbly presume to remind your grace of your promise to me,
when in England, that a commission should be directed to some persons here,
unconcerned, to audit and report their acts of this money. We want good
schoolemasters, none being here allowed of but of ill principle, and, till
there be provision made to rectifye the youth of this country, there is noe
hopes that this people will prove loyal. The money now converted to private,
or worse uses, will set up good and public schools and provide maintenance
for our minister, who now lives upon a small contribution, and are yet forced
to meet in the townhouse.

I cannot omit to acquaint your grace, how tender conscienced, members of our
old church, for so they are distinguished from the other 2 churches in Boston,
are. Not long since, I desired them to let their clerk toll their bell at 9
clock, Wednesdays and Fridays, for us to meet to go to prayers. Their men told
me, in excuse for not doing it, that they had considered and found it
entrenched on their liberty of conscience granted them by his Majestyes present
commission, and could in noe wise assent to it. The necessity of a church and
public schools and encouragement of ministers presses me to give your grace
this trouble, which I humbly entreat your grace to remember to effect, least
the small beginnings of the church of England settled here with great
difficulty, fall to the ground and be lost, for want of tymely relief and
countenance. All which is humbly submitted by

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to Mr. Povey.
Boston, May 21st 1687. Sir,
I Have with me your three letters of March the 7th, 11th and 7th April, by Mr.
Mason, for all which I heartily thank you, and for your particular direction in
the several stages of my employ. I have very lately had the bonds of masters of
ships bound from hence to England in my custody, and those are indorsed that
copys thereof are sent for England; you shall not fail of the duplicates if
this ship makes not too much speed, and for the future you may expect them with
my other accounts of the custom-house; however I am to take it as a favor if I
be permitted to send them directly to the custom-house, in regard I have been
censured for suffering my papers but to look first into the plantation office,
and the primier, there now, objected hard against me. Pardon my digression, you
are sensible how much business I have lying upon me, to send accounts and
duplicates from my custom-office. I am at 50 l. a year charge to keep an able
clerk. I cannot yet get any fees settled sufficient to pay that charge, Mr.
Stoughton, Mr. Wharton and others objecting that his Majesty's salary for 100
l. a year is to defrey all that charge, so that I am a great loser, besides I
am to have deputies in our several ports, and unless they allow fees I am not
capable of doing that service at a distance without deputies, and their not
allowing moderate fees is only to discourage from inspecting their irregular
trade. This his excellency has endeavored to have rectified, but is opposed by
my enemies, to my very great loss, and prejudice to my deputyes. Enclosed is
such an account as I could get from Mr. Hook, late treasurer in the province
of Main. Mr. Danforth, though several times putt upon it for an account, wholly
declines it, and said he never received any money but it was all paid to Mr.
Hook, treasurer.

His excellency tried all ways to bring the people to quitt rents. There were
several who would take grantes for lands, but as it now falls out his
excellency has none to dispose of; a little time will try what our new judges
Dudley and Stoughton will say, when either Indian purchase or grantes from the
general court are questioned before them. Sir, you will much wonder to hear I
have disposed of the secretaryes office, for a time, for too inconsiderable a
vallue, whenas it was judged worth 5 or 600 l. I lost money considerable, during
the time I had it, one part the president run away with, and it was not
settled, though his excellency endeavored it, but always opposed, and whatever
Mr. West can make of it, I could not get an able man to discharge it, but the
whole trouble, care and charge lay upon me. I, sometime after his excellencyes
arrival, was directed to prepare commissions, civil and military for the
whole territory. I made 12 in parchment for the peace, 240 military, copied and
engrossed in parchment all the laws, and dispersed copies through the whole
government, yet they scrupled to allow me for writing them, these matters have
so discouraged me that I thought it better to have some certainty than to leave
all loose, and know no end to the charge. I hope long ere this you have
received the minutes since his excellency's arrival, since which nothing
considerable has passed, only some laws about regulating cornfields and cattle,
coopers and casks, they stick hard upon that of possession as of a general
concern and, next to that, for a law for ministers maintenance, strongly
opposed by the quakers. We have had but one meeting of the whole council since
passing those laws; that of the rates of pieces of eight does not answer the
end, money grows very scarce and no trade to bring it in. The members of the
council of Rhoad Island and New Plymouth have enough of comeing to set in
council, 8 or 10 days a time, at their own charge, and I now expect but very
thin appearance for the future, in regard the tables are down, but to the
great dissatisfaction of our brethren.

Twill be for his Majestyes service to putt Mr. Shrimpton in the place of
Captain Champernoon, and Mr. Luscombe in the place of Mr. Jo. Sandford of Rhoad
Island, both dead. Since Colonel Dongan had notice of his excellencies letter
to the governor of Connecticott, he has sent his to tempt them to submit to New
York government, with assurance of the enjoyment of their estates and
properties, and that they shall all be continued in the government, with I know
not what other great advantages. If Connecticott go to New York, it will
certainly evince that collony and this government cannot subsist without a free
trade with Connecticutt, which will be debarred if they are not annexed to us,
or what is worse for us, to pay 10 per cent. for all wheat, porke, etc. brought
to us, which we cannot want.

Mr. Mason is very acceptable to his excellency and to many of us. -- reports
abroad that he has the better of Mr. Mason. Moody is out of humor, I believe
he will be obliged to leave this town. I entreat you to send the enclosed as
directed, and be assured that I am,

Sir, your most humble obliged servant, E. Randolph.
Sir,
You have herewith the duplicates of the laws sent by Capt. Ware.



To John Povey, Esquire
Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to Mr. Povey.
Boston, Jan. 24. 1687. Sir,
I Am obliged to you for yours of the 22d of Sept. last, with the news and
copy of Sir Robert Holmes commission, all which I gratefully received from
Capt. Leg, who arrived here the 10th inst. and delivered your letters, and
packetts to his excellency our governor, who, being in great sorrow for the
loss of his good lady who dyed the 22d instant, desires me to present his
humble service to Mr. Blathwayt and to yourselfe, and to excuse his not writing
to you by this accidental opportunity of a vessel going for Holland with
logwood and must touch at some port in England.

By the several Gazetts, filled with addresses, I find you are all at liberty
at home, and I believe the court is so taken up with the weightier matters of
state that there will be no room for my wife to address my petition for a
confirmation of my office of secretary and sole register, etc. which I pray may
be enlarged and extended to the limitts of the present government. I see no
reason why I should resede in my desires of getting an understanding gentleman
to come from home to engage in the discharge of the secretary's and register's
office, which is very beneficial to West, no fees being as yet agreed upon,
and I have ground to believe designedly done to discourage any to undertake
that office, whilst, in the mean time, he extorts what fees he pleases, to the
great oppression of the people, and renders the present government grievous. I
have wrote you of the want we have of two or three honest atturneys (if any
such thing in nature) we have but two, one is Mr. West's creature, came with
him from New York, and drives all before him; he also takes extravagant fees,
and for want of more the country cannot avoid coming to him, so that we had
better be quite without them than not to have more. I have wrote Mr. Blathwait
the great necessity of judges from England. I know there are some loyal
gentlemen and able lawyers, who have not practice; the judges with us, being
now 3, have 390 l. betwixt them all, besides their fees, which they make very
considerable to them: Now, two will serve our occasions. They ought to be of
the council, and their salaryes made up 400 l. a year, apeece, they will
deserve it. As for Mr. Bulkley he is stupefied and drown in melancholy, and
almost useless, being seldom with us. I formerly wrote you about a fit person
to assist in my office. Besides the loss I daily receive, Mr. West is cried
out upon by all; and whom Mr. Blathwayt or you should recommend will be
acceptable. Capt. Nicholson tells me Mr. Martin who was to come over with Col.
Kerke, is out of business and believes he would accept of the office: I would
have an honest gentleman, who will not be drawn to ill company, but will mind
his business: There are many about court, but now out of my mind. Pray, please
to assist my wife in what may be for my interest.

Several vessels are gone from hence to Bermodos, but are designed for the
wreck. No news yet of Sir John Norburrow or Sir William Phips being there. We
cannot yet agree upon the prizes of money: Some would have all pieces of 8,
though of 15 pennyweight, go at 6 s. New England, others at 17; but they stand at
17. Our money goes all away and shall have little or none to supply ordinary
occasions.

Since the governor's arrival, New Plymouth colony have great profitt by whale
killing: I believe they will have nigh 200 tons for to send to England, and
will be one of our best returns, now beaver and peltry fayles us. I have a
desire to see England once more, but know not when I can get an opportunity, or
my business will allow of my absence, till I take leave of it, which I am not
much disposed to think of till I hear all things are settled with you. I shall
write you all our proceedings, as opportunity offers. Not further, but that I
am, Sir,

Your most humble servant, Edward Randolph.
Just now notice is come that Will. Harris is arrived at Piscataqua.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. William Blaithwait to Mr. Edward Randolph.
Whitehall, 10th of March, 1687-8. Sir,
I Am to thank you for yours of the 23d of November, and would not fail to
answer the chief particulars. If the union of all New England under one
governor be acceptable on your side the water, what will the joining and
annexing to the same government be of all the English territories in America,
from Delaware bay to Nova Scotia? This is already determined by his Majesty,
and a commission constituting Sir Edmund Andros governor also of New York, as
united to and parcel of his Majesty's dominion of New England. And for the two
Jersies, scire facias's are expediting toward their union. This, besides other
advantages, will be terrible to the French and make them proceed with more
caution than they have lately done.

I am obliged to you for your kind present of cranberries, acorns, chestnuts,
etc. which came very well and are imparted to Mr. Robert Southwell. The little
box of locust trees was broke open and they are lost, which was a pity, since
they are so shady as you mention. I told the king of the black fox, who taking
not much notice of it, I keep it myself, unless you think otherwise to dispose
of it.

Care is already taken for the passing your patent for all New England, and if
Mr. Spragg were not in the way, it might have been for the whole new dominion.

Pray, present my humble service to Mr. Mason and let him know Mr. Povey gives
him particular instructions by this ship how to proceed regularly. The
governor needs not any order from hence to do justice. If Mr. Mason be
aggrieved he may appeal.

My humble service likewise to Capt. Nicholson, who I hope may be the lieut.
governor intended by the King for the New England. Nor let my service be
forgot to my cousin Treffry, whose relations are all very well.

Since you are so mindful of my concerns, the enclosed paper will show you how
the article for the auditors is to be worded. But pray remember the first
account of the president and council. It was sent back with several queries,
in order to the satisfying the lords commissioners of the treasury, and I
expect your return of it. And you may do well to help Sir E. Andros to dispatch
the first account since his arrival, by setting forth every particular, how
expended, more minutely than the parchment sent me does contain, that the Lords
of the treasury may not except against the method of it.

I send you the gazettes touching the pirates and Sir R. Holmes. The King has
granted him all pirates goods for 3 years and the power of pardoning for one
year. He offers fair to discoverers and such as surrender themselves, and will
certainly make good his promise. An accident on that account may make your
fortune, as you are most in the way of that sort of people.

I must not forget my humble service to all my other friends and acquaintance
with you. Time and patience will stand you in great stead, amidst your
disappointments and afflictions, and you will always find that I am most truly

Sir, Your faithful friend and humble servant, William Blathwayt.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Povey to Mr. Randolph.
Whitehall, 18 March 1687-8. Sir,
SINCE mine of the eighth instant, I can only let you know that your warrant
for secretary of New England, with Rhode Island included, and Conecticut, had
passed the King's hand, when it came further under consideration how that of
New York and the Jersies, which are now to be added in the general commission,
might be included without wrong to the present settlement there; and I believe
it will be agreed that your deputation to them shall be sufficient, so as he
may receive the whole profitts of it without any acknowledgment or charge, but
in the mean time your warrant is stopped till the amendment or rather addition be
agreed of; but you may expect to receive it at the same time the governor
receives his commission, which will be sent by Foy.

On the 10th Mr. Blathwayt writ to you and sent you a memorandum touching his
salary, of which I now send you a copy, and though I writ to you before upon this
subject, the enclosed being as it is settled by himself, you will please to
follow the method he prescribes.

We have no news, more than the enclosed proclamation for the recalling the
Kings subjects out of the States service; and three new regiments are raising
here.

I am, with much truth, Sir, Your most faithful humble servant, J. Povey.
My humble service to Mr. Mason, Capt. Nicholson and Capt. Trefry.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to Mr. Povey.
Boston, June 21. 1688. Sir,
I Received your two letters of the 8th and 18th March, the first at Pemmequid,
where, after a tedious passage in 5 or 6 boats and other water carriage, I
overtooke his excellency, being left behind at Boston, by sickness, about the
end of April last. The Governor, with his servants, traveled by land to
Piscataqua; Col. Mason was visiting the militia in the province of Maine, and
was forced to follow the Governor to Casco bay, where the Governor's sloop and
barge with 10 oars attended their coming; he went amongst all the islands in
Casco bay, visited Mr. Wharton's possessions at Pejepsgut, and rowed up many
leagues in Kennebeck river; from thence, by easy motions, they got to
Pemmequid, where he stayed 3 or 4 days to refresh themselves with sheep and
fowls, and then, with the Rose frigott, made toward Ponobscott; his
Excellency had sooner, by me before, appointed Capt. George to speak to
Monsieur St. Casteen, and to acquaint him with his comeing; the captain road
with his frigott before Casteen's door, sent his lieut. ashoare, Casteen
spoake to him and told him, but upon notice of the Governor's comeing, Casteen
and all the company retired, left the place to that (...) and left his house
shutt; the Governor landed, with other gentlemen with him, and went into the
house and found a small altar in the common room, which altar, and some
pictures and ordinary ornaments, they did not meddle with any thing belonging
thereto, but took away all his arms, powder, shot, iron kettles and some
trucking cloth and his chaires, all which were putt aboard the Rose and laid
up in order to a condemnation of tradeing, in the forte at Pemmequid; at their
return, notice being irregularly given to the Indian Sachem, neighbor to
Casteen, that he should have all his goods restored if he would demand them at
Pemmequid and come under obedience to the King, it is supposed he went and
acquainted the Governor at Port Royal of it, and how resented we were to
expect by the return of our fishing vessels. This Casteen is a Frenchman, has
lived there many years, has 3 or 4 Indian wives and goes a hunting with the
Indians, he has a tradeing house and sold the Indians, arms and ammunition in
the late Indian wars; he does not well like to be under the French government,
desires to live indifferent. His Excellency carried with him carpenters and
boards, nails and all necessary stores, intending to erect a forte at
Ponopscutt, the old one, as they say, being gone to ruin, formerly made up with
stone and turfe, but finding none there, was resolved to spare that charge till
a more proper time offered, and in his Excellency's return from Ponopscutt, 5
or 6 leagues off from thence, I meet the Governor at sea, I being bound to
Ponopscutt, but I then returned with him to Pemmaquid. The Governor sent out,
every way, messengers to summon in all the Indian Sachems; such as were at
Pemmaquid at his first arrival, stayed his return; they were well treated with
shirts, rumm and trucking cloth, but his Excellency, with a short speech, by
an interpreter, acquainted them that they should not fear the French, that he
would defend them, and ordered them to call home all their young men and they
should live quietly and undisturbed. There I went to one Shurt, town clarke of
Pemmequid, to know what leases were made lately and by whom, and for what quitt
rent; he told me that above 2 years ago Capt. Palmer and Mr. West produced to
them a commission from Col. Dongan, to dispose of all their land to whoever
would take leases at 5 s. the hundred acres quitt rent; they let there and at
a place called Dartmouth, 12 or 16 miles distant from Pemmequid, about 140
leases, some had 800 or 1000 acres, few less than 100, some but 3 or 4 acres,
and all paid 2 l. 10 s. 0 d. for passing their grantes of 100 acres of woodland
with 20 acres of marsh, wherever it could be found; but this bred a great
mischief amongst the people, few or none have their land measured or marked,
they were in haste and got what they could; they had their emissaries amongst
the poor people and frighted them to take grantes, some came and complained to
the Governor and prayed him to confirm their rights, which he refused to do,
the commission and whole proceeding being illegal, having notice they were to
be under his government, they resented it, but it served their turn. The poor
have been very much oppressed here, the forte run all to ruin and wants a
great deal to repair it; the Governor has ordered it to be well repaired; it
stands very well to command a very good bay and harbor about it, and will in
time be a good place, being the only good port for all vessels, eastward, to
ride well and secure by the forte from danger. At this time, Capt. Palmer and
Mr. West laid out for themselves such large lotts, and Mr. Graham, though not
there, had a child's portion, I think some have 8 or 10000 acres; I hear not of
one penny rent comeing in to the King from them who have their grants confirmed
at York, and this 5 s. an hundred acres was only a sham upon the people. At
our return, we saw very good land at Winter harbor, enough to make large
settlements for many people: The Governor will have it first measured and then
surveyed, and then will dispose of it for settlements.

Mr. Graham and his family are settled in Boston, he is made attourny general
and now the Governor is safe in his New York confidents, all others being
strangers to his council. My cosen Mason can make no progress in his
business, he has attempted to try his title at Piscataqua, but has been delayed
by the judges, and the inhabitants are far more obstinate than formerly, Mr.
West having told some of them that his title is little worth. All Mr. West
aims at is to have the passing grantes for all Mr. Mason's lands, and neither
he nor Graham will allow that he has power to make a grante to any tennant;
they are for leiveing him out of all. The news of the dissenters being
indulged and taken into favor, at home, encouraged this people, and the judges
will not give a cause for the King. They now dispute his Excellency's grantes
and plead either possession or Indian purchase in bar of it. The addition of
New York to this government does very much enlarge our bounds and may be of
great service to the crown, but they have been squeezed dry by Colonel
Dongan and his agents West and Graham, that there is little good to be done. We
are in great expectation of Foyes arrival, and some preparations are making
for a southarne expedition, but I believe Sir Edmund will not go into New
York till Col. Dongan is removed off the place, there is no good understanding
betwixt them, and it was not well done of Palmer and West to tear all in pieces
that was settled and granted at Pemmequid by Sir Edmund, that was the sceene
where they placed and displaced at pleasure, and were as arbitrary as the great
Turk; some of the first settlers of that eastern country were denied grants
of their own lands, whilst these men have given the improved lands amongst
themselves, of which I suppose Mr. Hutchinson has complained.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Danforth to Mr. Nowell.
Cambridge 22. 8. 88. Hon. Sir,
THESE are only to return you thanks for your kind letter dated July 3. 88. It
was exceeding welcome to hear from you, and the good aspect that his Majesty
has toward his poor New England subjects. I hope mine to your self, by Capt.
Belcher, might come seasonably; only let me advise not to present any thing by
way of complaint to his Majesty, for that I fear will do us more hurt than
good; it may be of use to present to friends to show the reason why we
supplicate his Majesty for the confirmation of us in our possessions, and that
he will grant us the same privileges that others of his plantations are not
denied, namely a general assembly, without which our condition is little
inferior to absolute slavery. And for my own part, if that cant be obtained, I
do not think the change of our governor will ease any thing, for the greater
interest at court will add greatly to our burdens, and emboulden him that has
the power in his hand to squease to extremity. I entreat you wholly to conceal
my name from those of our own people or others that you confer with, for it may
do me much harm and no good to the public. I shall think long till I hear the
issue of matters.

Concerning those matters that I wrote to you about, referring to myself, I
have received a letter from my sister that gives me account the time has now
passed so long that the matter is hopeless to find out any thing, and therefore
would not have you give yourself any trouble about it.

Mr. Peter Bulkley dyed about three months since, and verily his sun did set in
a cloud.

It has pleased God again to suffer the natives to do us mischief in July
last, three or more persons killed at Quackeage on Connecticot river, one man
at New Haven, and sundry at the Eastward, some at Kenebeck and Cape Porpos, in
all, about twenty six persons killed, so that all the out towns are driven into
garrisons, and under great affrightment. Sir Edmund has lately been at New
York, and from thence to Albany, etc. through the country, was absent about 11
weeks, and, as I hear, will not allow it to be called a war, but murtherous
acts, and he will inquire the grounds; is not pleased that any soldiers were
levied, in his absence, to send eastward, and has released from prison Indians
that were sent thence, i. e. from eastward. The winter is now upon us, but
whether that will occasion the succession of mischief I know not, but people
are generally much affrayd what will be the issue.

In case something be not obtained for settlement of property and restreyning
rigor in making orders, which they call law, and levying money, I fear what
has been done at court will exasperate and possibly may double the tale of
brick. I am exceeding sensible that it is very difficult for our friends on the
place to do much, unless God do in more than ordinary manner inspire the heart
of his Majesty to favor us. We are in no capacity to do any thing, not so
much as to pay what is of necessity to be done to officers, etc. in case his
Majesty's favor should be great, nor may we meet in our several towns to
consider of any thing for our own good, at home or abroad, (as the enclosed
copy of their order will show you, an unheard of tyranny) so that should any
disburse for us, I cannot, for my own part, see how it can possibly be gained to
repay, and yet people are at present in great expectation that, so many of our
friends being on the place, something will be gained.

I had noe thought to have wrote now, and therefore commending all to God, with
whom all things are possible, with my kind salutes. I take leave, and am

Sir, Your affectionate friend and servant, T. D.
I again beseech you to conceal my name from all men, for you well know how
great an object I am of their hatred.



Copy of a Letter from Mr. Thomas Danforth to the Rev. Mr. Increase Mather.
Cambridge in N. E. July 30th, 1689. Rev. Sir,
YOUR loveing lines were with much joy received and read by me, for which I
humbly bless God, and return yourselfe many thanks. By reason of the great
expectation of your sudden arrival (with other of your friends) I did
willingly omit writeing unto you by the last opportunity, but now, considering
the times are among those things reserved by God to his own dispose, I shall
adventure the riske of a few lines, committing yourselfe and my endeavors
herein to the good providence of God.

Its now 14 weeks since the revolution of the government here, the manner
whereof, before these can reach you, will spread far and near; future
consequences we are ignorant of, yet we know that, at present, we are eased
of those great oppressions that we groaned under, by the exercise of an
arbitrary and illegal commission, some brief account whereof is contained in
the declaration published the same day, a coppie whereof I herewith send you.
The business was acted by the soldiers that came armed into Boston from all
parts, to the great amazement of all beholders, being greatly animated by the
Prince's declarations, which about that time came into the country, and
heightened by the oppressions of the governor, judges, and the most wicked
extortion of their debauched officers. The ancient magistrates and elders,
although they had strenuously advised to further waiting for orders from
England, and discouraged any attempts of that nature so far as they had
opportunity, yet were they now compelled to assist with their presence and
counsels for the prevention of bloodshed, which had most certainly been the
issue if prudent counsels had not been given to both parties. A coppie of that
paper sent Sir Edm. Andross I have herewith sent you, upon which he forthwith
came and surrendered himself. The same day, about 30 more of the principal
persons of that knot were secured, whereof some were quickly released, and some
yet remain under restraint, Eight of whom, viz. Mr. Dudley, Sir Edmund, Mr.
Randolph, Mr. West, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Graiham, Mr. Sherlock, Mr. Farewell, the
representatives of the people, at their last sessions, voted unbailable. Mr.
Dudley in a peculiar manner is the object of the peoples displeasure, even
through out all the colonies where he has sat judge, they deeply resent his
correspondency with that wicked man Mr. Randolph for the overturning the
government, and the manner of his procuring his presidentship, his extreme
covetousnes, getting to himself so many bags of money, to the ruinating of
trade, and since Sir Edmund's arrival here, has been his great instrument in
the oppression of the people, choosing rather to do that base drudgerie then to
displease, and thereby endanger the loss of his honor and gain. These and
such like things have made him vile in the eyes of all generally both good and
bad, so that the governor and council, though they have done their uttermost
to procure his enlargement, yet cant prevail, but the people will have him in
the jaile, and when he has been by their order turned out, by force and tumult
they fetch him in again, and both he and the rest of them there remain till
released by orders from England. I am deeply sensible that we have a wolf by
the ears. This one thing being circumstanced with much difficulty, the people
will not permit any enlargement, they having accused them of treason against
their king and country; and those restrained, they, threaten at a high rate for
being denied an habeas corpus. I do therefore earnestly entreat of you to
procure the best advice you can in this matter that, if possible, the good
intents of the people and their loyalty to the crown of England may not turn to
their prejudice. The example of England, the declarations put forth by the
Prince of Orange, now our King, the alteration of the government in England
making the arbitrary commission of Sir Edmund null and void in the law; these
considerations, in conjunction with the great oppressions they lay under, were
so far prevalent in the minds of all, that although some could not advise to
the enterprise, yet are hopeful that we shall not be greatly blamed, but shall
have a pardon granted for any error the law will charge us with in this matter.
The exercise of Sir Edmund's commission, so contrary to the magna charta, is
surely enough to call him to account by his superiors, and also Mr. Dudley
that led the van in that tragedy; and for others of them, may we be quit of
them, as we hope for no good from them, so we are far from desiring to revenge
our selves upon them, let what they have met with be a warning to others how
they essay to oppress their Majesty's good subjects any more in that kind. I
crave an answer hereunto by the first opportunity.

I must also yet a little further acquaint you that sundry of those gentlemen
and merchants that were very active in this matter on the day of the revolution
yet, since, missing of what they expected the people universally crying up
their charter privileges and urging the old governor and magistrates to
reassume the former government all which they were designed to oppose but had
hopes to advance their private interests of which finding themselves now
disappointed, are greatly discontented and speak highly against the
representatives of the people and present government and, as we are informed,
sundry of them, mostly factors and strangers, have drawn a petition to the
lords of the committee for foreign plantations, pretending loyalty and advance
of revenue to the crown, and highly inveighing against the government and
people, whereas, in truth, they are the transgressors of those acts for trade
and navigation, and those whom they complain against are generally unconcerned
in either, and so incapable to do the thing they accuse them of. If any thing
of this nature be presented, let me entreat you sedulously to divert the
mischief intended and send me a coppie thereof by the first opportunity.

Capt. George, commander of the Rose frigott, was also the same day with the
rest of that knott seized, reports being spread by sundry of his men, that he
intended for France, there to wait on the late King James, and before his
departure to show his spleen against Boston, so that the people were afraid of
being murdered and burnt up in their beds, the lieutenant also a known papist.
The sails of the frigott are brought on shore and secured till the government
here receive their Majesty's order, for which deed its hoped we shall not
receive blame. We do crave that the circumstances of our case and condition in
all respects may be considered. Nature has taught us self preservation: God
commands it, as being the rule of charity toward our neighbor: Our great
remotenes from England denis us the opportunity of direction and order from
thence for the regulating ourselves in all imergencies, nor have we means to
know the laws and customs of our nation: These things are our great
disadvantage: We have always endeavored to approve ourselves loyal to the
crown of England, and are well assured that none of our worst enemies dare to
tax us in that matter, and we have also labored to attend the directions of
our charter, under the security whereof were laid by our fathers the foundation
of this his Majesty's colony, and we are not without hopes but that before you
do receive these lines we shall receive from their royal Majesty's the
confirmation of our charter, with such addition of privileges as may advance
the revenue of the crown, and be an encouragement to their Majesty's subjects
here. In mean time we shall pray for the long and happy reign of their
Majesty's, and God's blessing to be on his people in all their three kingdoms.

Committing yourselfe and all your pious endeavors for the felicity of this
part of God's church to the protection and blessing of God Almighty.

Dear Sir, I am your friend and servant, Tho. Danforth.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to the Governor of Barbados.
Goal in Boston, May 16. 89. Sir,
BY a heady multitude possessed with jealousyes that our Governor, Sir Edmund
Andros, was a papist and intended to bring on the French and Indians to cut off
the inhabitants, a general insurrection was intended and so perfected on the
18th of April last, that the Governor, hoping to secure himself in our fort,
missed an opportunity of going aboard the Rose frigott, then at anchor in the
harbor, and so, being overpowered, we were taken prisoners of war, as the
silly multitude told us. This proceeded from a daily expectation (that one
Mather, one of their ministers in Boston, had raised by his letters to them
from court in the height of popery) of a new charter. I know he or any other
(having first subscribed to repealing their penal laws and test) might for
their money obtain fair promises of, and he had so far prevailed with Sir
Thomas Powis, attorney general, that he had obtained a report in their favor,
upon many false suggestions, which, immediately on the P. of Orange his
intending to visit the court of England vanished; however, he had no other
engine to draw supplies of money from the dissatisfied party here, but to feed
them up with assurances of a new and much larger charter. They were impatient
at his delay and, hearing the news that all papists were either secured or
fled out of England, and would not believe but Sir Edmund was a papist and his
commission arbitrary and calculated only for the suppressing all persons of a
different persuasion; they caballed and accordingly executed their principal
resolutions: They have not yet sent to England, expecting Mather, their
Mahomett, or at least particular orders from court, which will not operate here
unless consonant to their humors. We have, at this day, above 100 persons
equally concerned as conservators of the peace, but their power signifies
nothing, further than it pleases the people; sometimes they are for having
their old magistrates reassume their former government; sometimes to form a new
model of government; but their being many more ready (and of necessity
disposed) to pull down than build up, they know not what to be at: Some, that
have estates and shipping abroad, fear they have done more than they can
answer, believing other governments will treat them as revolters from their
allegiance, and give them neither protection nor let them depart till they
have orders from home how to treat them. This you may please to communicate to
the other governments leeward of you, to whom I have not an opportunity to
write, who, I am well assured, will also highly resent it, and so will the
present constitution at home, whoever be in the throne, and not suffer so high
an indignity to be putt upon the most authentic authority any Prince can give
his subjects for their security and protection, whilst they act by a power
confirmed by the broad seal. God only knows how affairs stand at home. I am
confident they will never part with me, unless demanded, by a force or their
ships stoped in the plantations till I am delivered up for their liberty and
license to trade. This country is poor, the exact execution of the acts of
trade has much impoverished them; all the blame lies upon me, who first
attacked and then overthrew their charter, and was made the officer to continue
their Egyptian servitude, by my office of collector, etc. I entreat you to
represent my state to the Earls of Clarendon and Rochester, by the first
opportunity, and that the Governor and I may be sent for home by some frigotts.
I must confess there have been ill men from New York, who have too much
studdied the disease of this people, and both in courts and councills they have
not been treated well. However, nothing done can amount to countenance such an
open rebellion, and, were I in England, I must advise a general pardon, many
hundred of innocent persons being forced to act, otherwise to be imprisoned;
and the kingdom of England cannot loose this country nor govern it without
some respect and allowance to the weakness of those who are mislead and the
force of education and the byas of common prejudices: However, we are, at
present, as much distracted and as far from cementing into any sort of
government as at the building of Babell. God only keeps them from destroying
us.

You will have one Robert Glanvill from Salem, master of a ketch, he was
imprisoned here, for an abettor of pirates, and was imprisoned with 7 pirates,
he can tell you their names; he brought into this country 3700 and odd Spanish
hides, robbed from a Portugesse vessel, the men thrown overboard, with other
goods to the value of about 2000 l. This is all proved by sufficient witnesses
and they kept in goal till some particular order from Sir Robert Holmes. About
Oct. last, he sent his commission to the Governor and myself, dated the 26
Aug. 88. which we receiving not till November, and the Governor and I staying
to the eastward till the limite was past, could not agree upon a method of
proceeding against them, in regard they stood upon their justification, but
rather, we could not be assured of a jury that would find against them, upon
the most evident proof, but now they are at liberty, have their goods, and
perhaps may bring some of the hides, or barrels of small bars of copper to
your island: However, I think the ketch is forfeited for bringing in the
pirates and their goods to this country, knowing the men to be such, for
Glanvill, in his ketch, sailed in company with the pirates, in the vessel they
took, as far as New England; he went to Salem, appointed to meet them at Port
a Bear, in Nova Scotia, and did so and carried them supplies and provisions;
when they burned the vessel and brought away the goods in this ketch and other
vessels. This I heartily refer to your conduct and privacy, my life lying at
stake for the least discovery. I cannot trust Mr. Rudger, father in law to Mr.
West, with us, who has been a great instrument in imposing upon this people.

Sir, I wish you all happiness and remain Sir your humble servant, Ed. Randolph.

Copy of a Letter from Mr. Randolph to Dr. Cook.
Common Goal, Nov. 25th, Sir,
YOUR treating Sir Edmund Andross like a gentleman when you were last at the
Castle, shall be remembered with respect. By letters from my friends in England
I hear I am (but by what means I yet know not) made their Majesty's prisoner
and to be sent safe to Whitehall, 'twill be a favor to me and the rest of the
gentlemen with me if the poor wounded man, who has lain 16 days rotting in his
own excrement, might be taken and removed into some other warm place, that we
be not infected with the vehement stench; and christianity directs that he be
not suffered to perish and others with him for want of speedy redress, twill
be an aggravating circumstance of our imprisonment. If you please to call on me
as you come this way and taste a glass of cider you shall be welcome. Be
confident nothing shall render me otherwise than a hearty friend to all good
men.

I am yours, Ed. Randolph.

Copy of a Letter from the General Court to the Rev. Mr. Increase Mather in
London.
Much honored and dear Sir,
YOUR most worthy indefatigable and unwearied labor and service voluntarily
undertaken for the good of this your country, attended with so much difficulty
and hazard to your person, as it bespeaks your ready obedience to the command
of Christ in denying yourselfe, so it calls for our hearty acknowledgments and
real testimonies of gratitude, and we pray may be gloriously rewarded by the
God of New England. That you have not ere this had an account of our affairs
particularly directed unto your self, proceeded neither from forgetfullness
nor neglect, but solely from our daily expectations of seeing you here, we
being so long time without any intelligence from England. Your providential
deteinure behind our friends, who arrived about two months since, we hope was
in mercy, and will turn to our advantage. We understand there seemed to be an
absolute necessity of your appearance for us. We have thought it advisable to
send over our worthy friends Mr. Elisha Cook and Mr. Thomas Oaks, (who are
knowing and well acquainted with all transactions and the state of our
affairs) whom we have joined in commission with the right hon. Sir Henry
Ashurst, knt. and baronet and yourselfe, as our agents and representatives in
England, or so many of you as shall be there resident; and given them
instructions. The informations and evidences we have gathered up against Sir
Ed. Andross, and the others sent home with him, they bring with them, though
they fall greatly short of what might have been procured had not we been under
the disadvantage of missing to find Sir Edmunds papers at the time of the
revolution, which we then supposed to be burnt, or otherwise made away with,
and many of their actings in things that would make them most obnoxious, were
so subtly carried on as not to be committed to writing that might afterward
rise up against them. We expect no less than that they will greatly asperse
and calumniate this people, and endeavor to load them with all the infamy
imaginable. We hope our friends, now sent, will be reasonably provided to take
off the most of them, unto whom we must refer you and to the papers. You will
not wonder to see so great a number of that society of men come over, whom we
are glad to get rid of, they having been industriously diligent to interrupt
and disturb our public affairs here to our no small disadvantage. We have
endeavored to make some provision by this conveyance for the discharge of our
just debts in England, and refer it to yourselfe and others our friends joined
with you in commission, to make some suitable present unto such of those
honorable gentlemen who have befriended and assisted our affairs at the
court, unto diverse of whom we have written particularly, and sent the letters
open, that so you might have the perusal of them. We have been necessitated,
for the quiet of the people and preservation of the peace, to take the highest
steps in administration of government, by trying, condemning and executeing
some notorious criminals, found guilty of piracyes and murder, without doing
which we could not have lived, hopeing for a favorable resentment and
acceptance of what we have done therein, and doubt not of your assistance
thereto; praying the continuance of your care, pains and labor, to endeavor
the full obtaining of all that good you have wished and industriously intended
the procureing for us, if the Lord shall please to succeed therein; unto whose
gracious guidance and protection we heartily commend you, praying that God
will mercifully, in his good time, return you unto us, that we may see your
face again with joy; and earnestly begging your constant remembrance of us at
the throne of grace, that God may graciously guide and conduct us in all the
arduous affairs under our hand, so as may be to his glory and our own and
this people's everlasting good and comfort, with the tenders of our unfeigned
respects, we subscribe,

Sir, Your most affectionate and hearty friends, Sim. Bradstreet, Gov. in the
name of the genesis court.
Boston in New England, 29 January 1689.
