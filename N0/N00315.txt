BY THE GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL Assembled at BOSTON the 2d. of April, 1685.
To all His MAJESTY'S Subjects within the Government of MASSACHVSETS COLONY.
FOrasmuch as we are credibly Informed, that there is a Ship of about three
Hundred Tonns that has for some time been crusing on the Coast, between
Martyns Vineyard and Cape Cod, without the Limits of this Colony, whereof
Christopher Goffe is Captain, and one John Salter is Master, and by our best
Information is justly deemed and vehemently suspected to have been Wickedly and
Piratically taken from some of His MAJESTY'S Allies in the West Indies, and
does further appear to be true by their not coming under Command: Now that no
Person or Persons may plead ignorance of His MAJESTY'S Proclamation, or of the
Law Made and Published by the Governor and Company of this His MAJESTY'S
Colony agreeable thereunto, bearing Date, July 9th. 1684.

These are therefore in His MAJESTY'S Name, strictly to Charge and Require all
Persons whatsoever within this Jurisdiction, not to resort unto, or in any wise
join themselves with said Goffe or his Company, nor to receive or conceal any
of the Goods coming out of said Ship, nor nourish or comfort in any kind
Entertain, Harbor, Counsel, Trade, or hold any Correspondence by Letter or
otherwise with them the said Goffe or Company, contrary to said Law, and under
the penalty therein provided.

By Order, Edward Rawson Secr'.
