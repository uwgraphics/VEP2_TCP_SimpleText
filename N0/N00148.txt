AT A COUNCIL Held in Boston August the thirtieth 1675.
THE COUNCIL Judging it of Absolute necessity for the Security of the English
and the Indians that are in Amity with us, that they be Restrained their usual
Commerce with the English, and hunting in the Woods, during the time of
Hostility with those that are our Enemies;

Do Order, that all those Indians that are desirous to Approve themselves
Faithful to the English, be confined to their several Plantations under
written, until the Council shall take further Order; and that they so order
the setting of their Wigwams that they may stand Compact in some one part of
their Plantations respectively, where it may be best for their own Provision
and Defense and that none of them do presume to Travail above one mile from
the Center of such these dwellings, unless in Company of some English, or in
their Service near their dwellings, and excepting for gathering and fetching in
their Corn with one English man, on peril of being taken as our enemies, or
their Abettours: And in case that any of them shall be taken without the Limits
abovesaid, except as abovesaid, and do loose their Lives or be otherwise
damnified, by English or Indians: The COUNCIL do hereby Declare that they shall
account themselves wholly Innocent, and their Blood or other dammge (by them
sustained) will be upon their own heads.

Also it shall not be lawful for any Indians that are in Amity with us, to
entertain any strange Indians, or receive any of cur Enemies Plunder, but shall
from time to time make discovery thereof to some English that shall be
appointed for that end to sojourn among them, on penalty of being reputed our
Enemies, and of being liable to be proceeded against as such.

Also whereas it is the manner of the Heathen that are now in Hostility with
us, contrary to the practice of the Civil Nations, to execute their bloody
Insolences by stealth and sculking in small parties, declining all open
decission of their controversy, either by Treaty or by the Sword,

The Council do therefore Order; That after the Publication of the Provision
aforesaid, It shall be lawful for any person whether English or Indian, that
shall find any Indian traveling or skulking in any of our Towns or Woods,
contrary to the limits abovenamed, to command them under their Guard, and
Examination, or to kill and destroy them as they best may or can. The Council
hereby declaring, that it will be most acceptable to them that none be killed
or wounded that are willing to surrender themselves into custody.

The places of the Indians Residencies are Natick, Punquapaog, Nashoba, Wamesit
and Hassanemesit: And if there be any that belong to any other Plantations,
they are to repair to some one of these.

By the Council Edward Rawson Secrt.
