By His Excellency Coll. Benjamin Fletcher, Captain General and Governor in
Chief of His Majesty's Province of New York, etc. A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS His Majesty's Companies garrisons in this Province, are very much
weakened by Death, Sickness and Desertion, which renders the Fronteers in some
danger, upon the approach of an Enemy, It being of absolute Necessity, and a
Duty incumbent upon me to take care and provide for the Defense and
Preservation of this His Majesty's Province, which chiefly consists in the
strength of the Fronteers. And having under consideration the great hardship of
Detaching the Inhabitants, and how to join the ease and safety of the Province
together, to prevent an inevitable Necessity of Detaching, I have therefore
thought fit to publish and declare by this my Proclamation, That all Persons
who are qualified to carry Arms, and will freely and voluntarily inlist
themselves in any of his Majesty's Companys for one Year, for their
encouragement shall receive the Sum of Three Pounds paid in hand, as also Four
Pence a Day over and above their Provisions; and at the expiration of the Year
shall be discharged from the said Service.

Given under my Hand at His Majesty's Fort in New York, the One and Twentieth
Day of April, in the Eighth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, WILLIAM
the Third, by the Grace of God, KING of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc. Annoque Domini 1696. Ben. Fletcher.

God Save the KING
