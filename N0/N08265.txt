To the READER,
THAT wise Man Solomon, s^^th, that there i^ no new Thing under the Sun; but
its plain even to a D^monstration, that there are many new Discoveries made of
Things since his Days, that neither Solomon, nor all the wise Men thas had been
be^o^e him, knew any thing of: and for Instance, neither they nor he ^new any
thing of the Loadstone, Compass and Needle, the A^t of Printing, making of Gun
powder, and the Use of Fi^e A^ms, etc. Cour^eous and friendly Reader, I have
calcul^ted this Alman^^k ^or the Meridian of Charlestown, in South Carolina,
hoping that it w^ll give no Offense to either the Publ^sher or Printer of other
Alm^nacks. The meridianal Difference of Time West from London, is 5 Hours and
15 Min. and may, with little E^ror, serve all the adjacent Places from
Maryland, to the English Settlement^ in East Florida; for the Di^ference of
Time is but 7 Minutes that E^st-Florida is West from Charl^stown; and seeing
that C^arlestown is in the Lat. of 3^ Degrees. 45 North, and the City or Place of
Jerusalem, in the Lat. of 32 Degrees. 10 North, they only differ 35 Miles from
being in the same Parallel of Latitude; but the meridional D^fference of Time
that Charlestown is West from Jerusalem, i^ 7 Hours and 45 Minutes; that is,
the Sun rises 7 Hours and 45 Minutes, sooner at Jerusalem than it does at
Charlestown; and Jerusalem bears from Charlestown, South 89 Degrees. 42 Minutes
easterly, and distant from Charlestown, 5729 Miles. I have set down every Thing
in a plain Manner, so that the Reader may understand it: I may have committ^d
Er^or^, for no Man is infallable; if what I have done be of Service to the
Public, and please them, it will encourage both the Printer and me, to publish
another for the ensuing Year 1769.

A brief Explanation of this Almanac, for the Year 1768.
ON each Leaf on the left Hand Side, there are nine Columns; in the first
Column is the Days of the Month, in the second the Sunday Letter, and the Days

some of the Planets and other Stars; in the 4th the Time of the Sun's rising;
in the 5th the Time of the Sun's setting; in the 6th is the Length of every
Day; in the 7th the Moon's Age for every Day; in the 8th the Time of the Moon's
rising and setting, and in the 9th the Part of the Body where the Sign is: On

Courteous READER.
I Hope it will not be disagreeable to give a brief Relation of the original
Discovery and Invention of the Compass, an Instrument of so much Use and
universal Service, and Benefit to Mankind. The original Invention of this most
useful Instrument, (by the Help whereof the glorious Gospel has been
transmitted into the most dark and distant Corners of the Earth) some attribute
to one John Goia, or Flavia Gola, as others style him, of Amalphi, in Campania,
in the Kingdom of Naples, who only accommodated the Superfices thereof with
eight Points; that is, four cardinal, and four collateral, and so left the
Improvement of this Invention to be attempted by Posterity; others do entitle
the Invention thereof to the People of China. Doctor Gilbert, in his Book de
Magnete, asserts, that Paulus Venetus, transported it first into Italy, in the
Year 1260, having learnt it from the Chinese; and Mr. Barlow, in his Book,
entitled the Navigator's Supply, in 1597, relates a Story of two
East-Indians, that he had personal Conference with, (one of them was of
Manilla, in the Isle of Laron, the other of Miaco, of Iapan,) who declared,
that instead of our Compass, they used a magnetical Needle of six Inches, and
longer, upon a Pin, in a Dish of white China Earth, filled with Water, in the
Bottom whereof they have two Cross Lines for the principal Winds, the Rest of
the Divisions being left to the Skill of their Pilots. Also, he there relates,
that the Portuguese, in their 2 Mo. Feb. has 29 Days, begins on Monday.
Full Moon the 2 Day, 7 Min. after 3 in the Afternoon. Last Quarter 10th Day,

25 13 31 Discoveries of the East Indies, got a Pilot of Malinde, that brought
them from thence in Thirty Three Days, within the Sight of Calcutta; by which
it appears, that then they had the Use of the Compass.

Let the Invention be attributed to whom it will, it is manifestly known to have
received it is absolute Perfection in Europe: but more particularly, the
completing of this Invention, is annexing to the Compass Twenty Four
subordinate Winds or Points, and also on the Limb thereof Three Hundred and
Sixty Degrees, which are numbered from North and South, toward the East and
West, with 10, 20, 30, etc. so that it appears that every Point contains
Eleven Degrees, and Fifteen Minutes. Upon the North Point there is a
Flower-de-Luce, to distinguish it from the Rest of the Points.

Now after all that has been said about the Compass, or rather all the Thirty
Two Points thereof, it would have been of little or no Service at all without
the Addition of the Magnetical Needle; the Two together makes one of the most
valuable Instruments in the known World, if rightly used; and on the other
Hand, if it be applied to bad Designs and Purposes, more hurtful than
Gunpowder.

Now in the next Place, it may not be improper to speak some Things of the
Variation of the Compass, and of the natural Cause thereof; with some
Observations on the Variation. The Variation of the Compass, 3 Mo. March, has
31 Days, begins on Tues.

10 is an Angle intercepted between the Magnetical and true Meridian, and the
Horizon determining it is Quantity and Quality.

These Meridians sometimes coincide in such Places where there is no Variation,
sometimes again they are different, and then that Part of the Horizon wherein
the northern Extremity of the Needle lies, denominates it is Quality; for if it
be to the E^s^ward, then it is easterly Variation; if to the Westward, then
westerly Variation.

This Variation of the Compass, was formerly supposed to remain the same; which
I suppose has given Rise to the Opinion of the first Author thereof, Mr.
Seller, who (as it appears by former Impressions of his Book) supposed the
Variation of the Compass to be occasioned by the Excavation of some Parts of
this Terrestrial Globe; and by Magnetical Veins collaterally respecting the
Needle, etc.

But now the Variation is known to vary in all Places, as appears by the
following Observations of the Variation of the Compass near the City of London,
for above One Hundred and Seventy Seven Years last past.

Mr. Buroughs, comparing several Observations, made at Lime-House, October the
16th, 1580, and found the mean Variation to be Eleven Degrees and Seventeen
Minutes, easterly.

By Mr. Gunter's Observations at the Lime-House, June the 13th, 1622, the mean
Variation was then Five Degrees and Fifty Five Minutes, easterly.

Mr. Gillibrand, by his Observation made at Deptford, June the 12th, 1634,
found the mean Variation to be Four Degrees, Six Minutes, easterly, and July
the 4th, 1634, he found by his Observations at Pauls-Cray, in Kent, the mean
Variation Four Degrees and One Minute, easterly.

Mr. John Seller, by Observations made at the Hermitage, near London, June the
4th, 13th, and 14th, 1666, found the mean Variation to be no Degrees, only
Thirty Four Minutes, easterly.

The Worshipful Sir Nicholas Millet, at his House in Battersey* comparing
several Observations, made May the 28th, 1670, found the mean Variation then to
be Two Degrees and Six Minutes, westerly.

If we compare the first of these Observations, viz. that of Mr. B^rroughs, in
the Year 1580, with those of the famous Captain Halley, who in the Year 1701,
found the Variation in all Parts of the Channel, to be Seven Degrees and Thirty
Min^tes, westerly; the mean Motion of the Variation, between those two
Observations, will be found to be about 11 31/33 in a Year; but comparing the
two first Observations, viz Mr. Buroughs, and Mr. Gunter's, the mean (...) is
Eight Degrees and Thirty Six Min^tes, East (...) it^ mean Motion is but 7
Minutes in a Year; (...) by the Observations of the aforesaid Captain Halley,
when the Variation was about 7 Degrees westerly, it increased about Ten Minutes
in a Year; all which seems to import, that the Motion of the Variation i^ 3 Mo.
May, has 31 Days, begins on Sunday.

is nearest its Period, or greatest Deviation, according to the following Theory
of Mr. Bond; and how far this may tend to the confirming of the Opinion of
those who think that the Position of the Wires of the Compass, nearly parallel
to the Axis of the World, is occasioned by Magnetical Poles, which have a
regular Motion about (and at the same Distance from) the Poles of the World; we
must leave to Time and future Observations, to determine: But in the mean Time,
it seems incosistent with Reason, (if not impossible in Nature) that the
Variation of the Needle should be (...) by the Excavation of some Part of the
Globe of the Earth, since such Excavations must be allowed to be always the
same, contrary to our Hypothesis of the Variation; which by above 160 Years
Observation compared, is found to have a general (and perhaps regular) Motion;
and by my own Observation, made in June, 1740, I found the mean Variation of
the Surveying Compass, to be Seven Degrees, westerly; and by another
Observation, made the 24th of July, 1764, the Variation of the Needle was at
that Time, just Three Degrees and a Half, westerly.

In short, from Observations made in dif^^rent Parts of the World, it appears,
that in different Places the Variation differs, both as to its Quantity and
Denomi^ation, it being East in one Place, and West in another; the true Cause
and Theory of which, for want of a sufficient Number of Observations, has not
yet been fully explained.

If you answer the Query, I Will take it as an Honor,
If not, excuse the rough Music of Tongs and of Hammer.
Answer.

To the Hammer the primitive Honor belongs,
Since it forged long after its Daughter the Tongs;
Though Venus before might have found out the Manner
Of forging of Horns; what is that to the Hammer?
'Twas (...), long after, the Devil his Wrongs,
Endur^ (...) his Nose, by St. Dunstan's hot Tongs;
The Hammer first also set Music to Songs,
But the devil of Music are Keys and the Tongs;
Then strike home ^^^ve Vulcan, and no longer Ham her,
And Venus wi^^ ^^^rifice Mars to the Hammer.
Question. Sin^^ ^he Devil is called the Prince of the Power of the Air, is it
possible to raise Tempests by Conjuration?

Answer. When the Devil is styled the Prince of the Power of the Air, the
Meaning is, that God has given him an extraordinary Power in these lower, these
sublunary Regions; but the Scriptures, which acquaint us with this
extraordinary Power in general, do no where represent the particular Extension
of it: it is suf^^^^ent to our Purpose, that a Creature so extraordina^^
powerful, is not irresistible to Man; to impotent, to ^rail Man; for, resist
the Devil and he will ^lee (...) you.

Whether the Child, by this Mistake begot,
Be spurious, illegetimate or not?
Answer. The Child is undoubtedly legetimate, since there is nothing more
required to the Legetimacy of a Child, than its owing its Original to those who
at the Time of its Birth, are joined together in holy Matrimony; but yet the
Father, with regard to his own Guilt, may consider the Child under the Notion
of a Bastard.

Question. Why do Cur-Dogs, (for the most Part) bark at Beggars, and such like,
and not at People well dres'd?

Answer. The disagreable Dress of Beggars, produces a disagreable Sensation in
the Dogs, which moves them to vent their Displeasure at the Objects of it.

Question. Gentlemen, the Godfathers and Godmothers, when an Infant is
baptized by a Minister of the Church of England, solemnly promise and vow to
God, in the Name of the said Child or Infant, that he or she shall live and be
perfect from Sin all the Days of its Life: I think the Ordinance of Baptism
imports thus much, yet the Members of the said Church, generally in discourse
argue against Perfection, without at, or near the Point of Death?

Answer. The Godfathers and Godmothers, do no where in the Office of Baptism,
promise for the Infant a perfect, and unsinning Obedience: it is true indeed,
they promise that the Child shall conform to 9 M. September has 30 Days, beg.

fall short of absolute Perfection; bu^ then this Conformity they promise, is to
take its Estimation from the Measures of Sincerity, and not from the Standard
of Perfection; that is, they promise in the Child's Name, that it shall
sincerely endeavor to comply with the whole Law of God, as far as frail
Mortality will permit. The Promise therefore of Godfathers and Godmothers, is
^o be taken in the same Sense with that excellent Petition in the Lord's
Pray^r; thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven; for it is not supposeable
that Men can be as perfect as Angels: Men encompassed with Dust and Ashes, as
perfect as those disencumbred, those unbodied Spirits; when therefore we put up
that Address to the Throne of Grace, we no more than implore our heavenly
Father that he would enable us to come as near to those pure, those spotless
Beings, as the necessary Condition of our Mortality will admit.

Question. Whether does Dew arise from the Ground, or fall from above?

Answer. The Sun in the Day exhales the Moisture of the Earth, which, after
Sunset, falls upon the Ground, under the Name of Dew.

Question. Why does a drunken Man see double?

Answer. The Fumes of the Liquor he is intoxicated with, may be supposed so to
disorder his Eyes, as that the Representation of the Object cannot fall upon
the correspondent Fibers of the Optic Nerves; whence it becomes impos^ible,
that the twofold Image exhibited by the two Eyes, should ever so unite as to
produce but one Resemblance in the Brain.

Question. Desire you to oblige me so far as to give me a Reason why I, that am
so very ticklish, cannot tickle myself?

Answer. As Harmony arises from discordant Notes, so the Complacency we call
tickling, (though yet it be a sort of painful Pleasure) springs from diversity of
the Object that produces it; and therefore the Reason why a Man cannot tickle
himself, is, because there is too great Analogy between the several Parts of
the same Body.

Question. Was the Virgin-Mary a perpetual Virgin?

Answer. The Argument drawn from that Expression, thy Mother and thy Brethren
stand without, etc. to disprove her a perpetual Virgin, carries no manner of
Conviction with it, since it was customary with the Jews to represent near
Relations under the endearing Style of Brethren; and yet, had there been no
such Custom, they might have been Ioseph's Children by a former Wife: if to
this it be replied, that as Joseph 11 M. November has 30 Days, beg. on Tues.

12 24 was the elder Line, so his Children were nearer to the Crown than Mary's,
and consequently her Son could have no Title to be King of the Jews; we answer,
that God indeed made a sure Oath unto David, that his Seed should sit upon his
Seat for ever; but nev^r promised the Succession to the elder Line: And this
Reply is the more confirmed, in that the Son of David was to be a spiritual,
not a temporal King: in that the Prophecy, he shall have Dominion also from Sea
to Sea, was to be fulfill^d in a mystical Intendment, agreeable to the
Profession of that very Son of David; my Kingdom is not of this World: and as
this is a Confutation also to that similar Objection which may be started in
defense of the other Side, namely, that Joseph never knew his Wife, because his
Children by her must have been preferred to the blessed Ie^us: As what has been
already said, is equally a Confutation to this Objection also, so we may
consider too, that Joseph might have known his Wife, without any Necessity of
having Children by her, that if Mary would have naturally born him Children;
yet since Children are a Gift that comes of the Lord, that God, to whom, as
the Jews express it, the Key of the Womb belongs, might have purposely
restrained her natural Fertility, and, as it were, have said to the blessed
Virgin, thus far (namely to the Birth of the holy Jesus) shall thou go, and no
farther. Some allege that those Expressions, Joseph knew her not till she had
brought forth her firstborn; plainly intimate that 12 M. December has 31 Days

knew her afterward. To which others (among whom is the excellent Bishop
Pearson,) make, as they think, a very clear reply, namely, that from parallel
Expressions in the Scriptures, it appears, that there is no Necessity for such
an Intimation: But we beg Leave to observe, that in the various Instances they
produce, there is not one parallel to the Case before us; for if in them no
such Intimation presents itself, it is because there is an obvious, an apparent
Reason for it. To give you a Specimen, in first of Samuel, xv.35, we read, and
Samuel came no more to see Saul, until the Day of his Death; now since the
Passage signifies that Samuel came no more to see Saul as long as he lived,
there is a parallel Reason, why it cannot be intimated, that he came to see him
afterward; namely, because it was impossible he should; whe^^as no
Impossibility can be alleged in Ioseph's Case. Our Lord, say some is called
the firstborn Son of Mary; and the mention of a First (say they) implies a
Second; but this Objection is readily confuted by the Scripture usage of the
Phrase, as may appear from Exodus xiii.2, sanctify to me all the firstborn; for
they who had but one Child, were from that Command* obliged to sanctify him to
God.

A learned Man concludes it at lea^t improbable, that Joseph should so long
cohabit with his Wife, without the Knowledge of her, since we ^o where read,
that God had enjoined him so severe an Ab^tinence. But to this we answer, that
we no where read that Joseph was commanded to abstain, till she had brought
forth her fir^^-born ^on: and therefore the Argument proves too much, since it
proves withal, that he did not abstain, till she had brought forth her
firstborn Son; and yet this is contrary to the Text: We need not wonder that
the ancients were of opinion, that Mary was a perpetual Virgin, since they
exalted Virginity to so high a pitch; nor that Origin was so strenuo^s a
defender of that Opinion, since he so grossly misapplied a Sentence of our
Lord's concerning Virginity; nor that the Romanists were of the same Mind with
the Ancients, since they look upon a marriage-state as not sufficiently pure
for holy Orders: As we may be ready to conclude that she remained a Virgin,
while we consider her high Prerogative as Mother of our Lord, as having been
overshadowed by the Holy Ghost; so this Consideration is wonderfully enfe^bled
by th^se Suggestions; namely, that what she was afterward, reflects nothing
upon what she was before; that Marriage is honorable, and the ^ed undefiled;
that that holy State is dignified with being an Emblem of Christ's Union with
the Church. And thus we have thought it proper to examine the Arguments on both
Sides, and propose the Objections, they are liable to, rather (...) determine
the Matter in Debate, as thinking it best to follow the great St. B^sil^.
Advice, and leave so controverted a Point ad huc sub ju^ice, since it is of
small Concern to the Mystery of our Redemption.

JAMES SIMPSON.
A Receipt for curing the LAME DISTEMPER, YAWS, or almost any corrupt blood,
etc. for which the discoverer had a gratuity of three thousand pounds allowed
him by the Commons House of Assembly of this province.
FIRST bleed in the arm, on the side where most sores lie; if no sores, in the
arm on the side where most pain is, if any odds: Then purge with pilulae ex
duobus, from fifteen grains to 35 or 40, according to the strength or age of
the patient; divide the pilulae ex duobus into five pills, give three just
before the patient goes to bed, and two in the morning, working it off with
gruel. Continue this method of purging three or four times, but let there be
two or three days between each purge. Where the patient is weak, purge with
extractum rudii, giving two or three pills every other night; the pills to be
about the size of a garden pea: If the patient is weak and unable to bear it,
there must be a longer intermission. After the above medicines are made use of,
according to the directions above, then have ready the following

DIET DRINK.
TAKE six or eight ounces of sarsaparilla, the same quantity of dried China
root split and chiped fine, to which add an ounce and an half, or two ounces of
gum guiacum: Put the sarsaparilla into an iron pot, to which add eight or ten
quarts of water; if the patient is strong put eight, if weak put ten quarts. If
the disorder is hard to be cured, I add half a pound of antimony grossly
powdered, and put into a linen bag tied loosely, and hang it in the pot (if the
patient is weak add a handful or two of buckshorn shavings) covering the pot
very close, and pasted tight round the brim that no steam can come out, setting
it over a gentle fire of coals, so that it may stew or simmer for twelve hours;
then take it off the fire, and let it cool before you open it; then bottle it
for use.

Give the patient a gill and an half first in the morning, and the same
quantity going to bed, at night.

The patient must take particular care to keep to a strict diet, such as, wheat
bread well raised, or good bisk^t; their common drunk must be, small beer
brewed with molasses.

The above directions to be strictly observed 'till the patient is well, if
strength will permit: If the patient is unable to bear the diet drink, he must
quit it, and live upon the aforementioned bread and beer for three days, and
then he may with safety take nourishment.

For an old POX.
TAKE eight ounces of sarsaparilla, eight ounces of dried china root chipt or
split fine, two ounces of gum guiacum, four ounces of the root of a plant or
bush known by the name of queen's-delight, or pock-root, to be put in a pot as
before directed, with eight quarts of water: And the above directions to be
observed in every particular, not forgetting to bleed and purge as before
directed.

To cure the CANKER.
TAKE Holly-Leaves a good quantity, and burn them to ashes, pulverise them very
fine, and add as much alum pulverised as there is ashes: Take a piece of rag,
and rub the ashes on the sore twice a day; then take an ounce of salt, and an
ounce of alum, put in one pint and an half of water, put it over the fire
'till it is dissolved, and wash the ashes and alum out of the sore with the
water, a quarter of an hour after it is dressed.

CHARLESTOWN, ss.
JOSEPH HOWARD, being duly sworn, made oath before me, that he has made a plain
and full discovery of the medicines and methods used by him in the cure of the
Lame Distemper, Yaws, and other scorbutical disorders, as described in the
directions before annexed.

Sworn before me, this 24th March, 1759. JOSEPH HOWARD. THOMAS WRIGHT.


The Negro CAESAR's cure for poison, for discovering which, the assembly of
this province purchased his freed^m, and gave him an annuity of one hundred
pounds.
TAKE the roots of plantane and wild hoarhound, fresh or dried, three ounces,
boil them together in two quarts of water to one quart, and strain it; of this
decoction let the patient take one third part three mornings fasting
successively, from which, if he finds any relief, it must be continued till he
is perfectly recovered: On the contrary, if he finds no alteration after the
third dose, it is a sign that the patient has not been poisoned at all, or that
it has been with such poison as Caesar's antidote will not (...), so may leave
off the decoction.

During the cure the patient must live on spare diet, and abstain from eating
mutton, pork, butter, or any other fat or oily food.

N. B. The plantane or hoarhound, will either of them cure alone, but they are
most efficacious together.

In summer you may take one handful of the roo^s and branches of each, in place
of three ounces of the roots of each.

For drink, during the cure, let them take the following.
TAKE of the roots of golden rod, six ounces, or in summer two large handfuls
of the roots and branches together, and boil them in two quarts of water to one
quart, to which also may be added, a little hoarhound and sassafras; to this
decoction, after it is strained, add a glass of rum or brandy, and sweeten it
with sugar for ordinary drink.

Sometimes an inward f^ver attends such as are poisoned, for which he orders
the following.
TAKE one pint of wood ashes, and three pints of water, stir and mix them well
together, let them stand all nig^t, and strain or decant the lie off in the
morning, of which ten ounces may be taken six mornings following, warmed or
cold, according to the weather.

These medicines have no sensible operation, though sometimes they work in the
bowels, and give a gentle stool.

The symptoms attending such as ar^ poisoned are as follows.
A PAIN of the breast, difficulty of breathing, a load at the pit of the
stomach, an irregular pulse, burning and violent pains of the viscera above and
below the navel, very restless at night, sometimes wandering pains over the
whole body, a reaching inclination to vomit, profuse sweats (which prove always
serviceable) slimy stools, both when costive and loose, the face of a pale
yellow color, sometimes a pain and inflammation of the throat, the appetite is
generally weak, and some cannot eat any; those who have been long poisoned, are
generally very feeble, and weak in their limbs, sometimes spit a great deal,
the whole skin peels, and likewise the hair falls off.

CAESAR's cure for the bite of a RATTLE-SNAKE.
TAKE of the roots of plantane or hoarhound (in summer roots and branches
together) a sufficient quantity; bruize them in a mortar, and squeeze out the
juice, of which give, as soon as possible, one large spoonful; if he is
swelled, you must force it down his throat: This generally will cure; but if
the patient finds no relief in an hour after, you may give another spoonful,
which never has failed.

If the roots are dried they must be moistened with a little water.

To the wound may be applied, a leaf of good tobacco moistened with rum.

The cure for the bite of a RATTLE-SNAKE, as discovere^ by SAMPSON, a negro:
For which discovery the province purchased his freedom, and allows him an
annuity.
TAKE heart snake-root, both root and leaves, two hand^uls, polypody leaves one
handful, bruise them in a mo^tar, press out a spoonful of the juice, and give
as soon as possible after the bite; then scarify the wound, and take the root
of the herb avens, bruise it, pour a little rum over it, and apply to the part,
over which is to be put the heart snake-root and polypody after the juice is
squeezed out. Th^se medicines and applications must be repeated according to
the violence of the symptoms, so as in some dangerous cases it must be given to
the quantity of eight spoonfuls in an hour, and the wound dressed two or three
times in a day.

The above herbs may also be bruised and beat up into a paste with clay, and
when necessary may be scraped down to the quantity of half a common spoonful,
and given amongst a little rum and water, and repeated as the doses of the
juice above mentioned. A little of this paste may be wet with ^um and rubbed
over the wound.

N. B. He always uses this method when he cannot find the green herbs.

Sometimes the cure is entirely performed by the patient's chewing the heart
snake-root, and swallowing the juice, and applying some of the same herb
bruised to the wound.

When the part is greatly inflamed and swelled, all the herbs in the following
list are taken to the quantity of some handfuls of each, and boiled into a
strong decoction, with which it is to be fomented several times a day.

The herbs presented l^st by Sampson, are
1. Asarum cyclimini ^olio, or, heart snake-root of this province. 2.
Polypodium vulgar, or, common polypody. 3. Caryophyllata Virginiana radice
inodora, or, Virginian avens, called here five fingers. 4. Lonchitis aspera,
or, rough spleenwort. 5. Hypnum julaceum, or small erect clubmosa. 6. Gna^
^alium humile, or, creeping goldy locks.
Said Sampson is the same negro who used frequently to go about with
^attle-snakes in calabashes, and who would handle them, put them into his
pockets or bosom, and sometimes their heads into his mouth, without being
bitten. -- In proof of the efficacy of his medicines, he several times suffered
himself to be bitten by the most venomous snakes, and once his wounds came so
near a mortification, that it was doubted whether he would recover, and cured
himself with them. -- It is said, he disarms any snake of its venom with some
one of the herbs; and that chewing the heart snak^-root, and spitting the juice
upon a snake will instantly kill it.

Some account of the Seneka-Rattle Snake Root, with directions for curing the
pleurisy with it: Published in the Virginia Gazette, by Dr. John Tenn^ni, when
he first discovered the properties and uses of that certain and valuable remedy.
FIRST, when the patient is taken, let ten ounces of blood be drawn from the
arm of the side opposite to that affected with the disease, and presently give
three spoonfuls of the decoction of rattle-snake root, which must be repeated
every six hours, till the symptoms abate in a great degree. But if they should
return notwithstanding, which happens sometimes, bleeding is to be repeated in
the same quantity as at first, and so in like manner a third and fourth time,
or oftener; though it seldom happ^ns that it is wanted above twice; which
method answers for the cure of pleurisy, generally speaking: But in particular
cases, where the patient has a purging attending the disorder, give twenty
grains of the root, every three hours, with ten grains of cinnamon powdered, and
as much hartshorn, observing also to let blood as often as the symptoms recur;
by which is meant the pain, fever, cough, and diffiulty in breathing. When the
breast is only affected with the pain, or both sides and the breast affected at
once, the same method is to be followed as when one side is only affected, the
disease being the same notwithstanding that difference in the symptoms. For
ordinary drink, give hysop decoction, or a tea drawn from marshmallow roots,
sweetened with honey; but in case of a purging attending the case, let the
drink be sweetened with double refined sugar, and the cinnamon and hartshorn
before prescribed, are to be given with the powdered rattle-snake root in a
little of it; and it is to be observed, that both the decoction of the root and
tea are given warm. If the patient be troubled with a vomiting, or nausea, give
one spoonful and an half of the decoction every three hours, or if that should
be immediately thrown up, give half a spoonful of the decoction every hour;
observing in such case to bleed as before advised. There is a disease called a
pleurisy, wherein bleeding is of ill consequence, which may with great
propriety be called a latent or spurious peripneumony; yet the above method
with the decoction of the root, is a very certain one, giving instead or
^^ctoral teas, a tea made of thyme or marjoram, or rather rum-punch. This
disease personates a pleurisy or peripneumony, to a superficial observer, the
symptoms being the same, only with this difference, that the pulse is always
low, which in an inflammatory pleurisy or peripneumony, is so only upon the
first invasion, or when the disease is upon terminating in death: -- But it is
to be noted for a mark of this latent peripneumony, that upon its first
approach the patient is cold, convulsed, and very much inclined to sleep, and
also that it attacks in autumn after excessive hot summers attended with much
rain; and toward February, or sooner, if the winter sets in very cold,
translates to an inflammatory pleurisy or peripneumony. The operation of this
root is different according to the circumstances of the constitution and
disease; sometimes it is by vomit, at other times by sweat, urine and stool,
and in some cases, such as a latent peripneumony, it has none of these
operations in any degree; yet the patient is surprizingly recovered; which
shows that it strongly attenuates the blood. The success of the aforesaid
method is proved from experience to be so great, that an intermitting fever is
not carried off with more certainty with Jesuits bark, than a pleurisy or
peripneumony is with the seneka rattle-snake root. And the cure is often
effected the third day, if the method be followed up from the first attack of
the distemper, and also that the patient will find great relief in the space of
an hour after the decoction; though every one may not, yet it has that effect
very often: And whether the disease be in the beginning, increase, or last
state, the medicine has like effects, and answers to perfection the designs of
all the methods prescribed by authors of the best note for these different
stages.

The decoction of seneka rattle-snake root is made by boiling three ounces of
it in a quart of water over a slow fire till near one half is evaporated; then
strain the liquor through a cloth. The root must be reduced to a gross powder,
that, the water may fully draw its efficacy. The plant grows plentifully in
Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, in the freshes and hilly grounds, and
affects a light and tolera^^^ good soil. The root is of a light yellow color,
resembling ippecacuana in its texture and shape, but it is larger, has a strong
pungency without heat, but does not communicate that property upon chewing it
immediately. The leaves are something like green tea, and the stalk is commonly
from six to twelve inches high, on the top of which are white flowers something
like the rattles of a snake, while in bud, which appear among the first flowers
in the woods: And there are no branches from the stalks, but several stalks
arise from one root generally, though only one stalk from a root may be seen
sometimes.

A Receipt for the Cholick, advised by an eminent Physician in England.
TAKE one Spoonful of Geneva, one of Sweet Oil, and one of Molasses, or brown
Sugar, and one of Water. Give this to the Patient, made warm, and apply a warm
Cloth to the Part affected. If this does not relieve, repeat the Dose.

How to cure the Cholick, vulgarly called the Dry-Belly-Ach.
1. It is of two Sorts; the one causes a Stoppage of the Urine, a violent Pain
in the Back and Bottom of the Belly. In this Case, bleeding should be repeated
in the Arm or Foot.

2d. The other Sort commonly causes a vomiting, with a violent Pain in the
Stomach and Belly, which if not relieved in Time, causes Convulsions and a
Paulsy; by which the Patient looses the Use of his Hands: If there is a Fever
with this, it is also proper that Bleeding should be repeated. In either of
these Cases, you must give a Clyster, made with an Ounce of Coloquantide (or
otherwise called Coloquita) a Quarter of an Ounce of Sena, about half an
Handful of Salt, and as much Annis or Finnel Seed; the above Quantity is for
three Clysters, adding two Spoonfuls of Honey, and two of Sweet Oil to each
Clyster. If this does not operate in about Half an Hour, give another, and if
that should ye^ fail, then let it be repeated a third Time, but made a little
stronger. -- If after the Operation of this Clyster the Pain should still
continue, as it often does; in this Case give a Clyster of Milk, in which put
six Grains of Opium, just as you are taking it from the Fire: In Case you have
no Opium, boil some Poppy Heads in Milk; prepare some mineral Waters to take
the next Morning; to prepare which, take about 15 or 20 Grains of Roman
Vitriol, vulgarly called Blue-Stone; put it in a Bottle of clear Water, and in
the Morning give a Glass of it* which commonly causes a vomiting: About Half an
Hour after give a second, and after the same Space of Time a third Glass. If
after this the Patient feels any Pains, he must continue taking this Water for
two or three Days. It is very common for this Sickness to leave a Pain in the
Stomach; if so, give a Dose of 40 Grains of Rhubarb, and apply a Plaster of
Gabbanum to the Stomach.
