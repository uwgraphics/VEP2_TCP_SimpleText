At a Court Held at Boston in NEW ENGLAND the 29th. of March, (...)
THe COUNCIL being informed, that (...) strange Indians, who have been in
Hostility against us or have lived amongst such, are brought into this
Jurisdiction, and bought by several persons, which causes much trouble and
fear to the Inhabitants where they reside, and may be of dangerous consequence,
not only to the Towns where they live, but to the whole Jurisdiction, if not
timely prevented:

It is therefore Ordered that what person soever within this Jurisdiction shall
hereafter buy or keep above ten days after the publication hereof, any such
Indian, Man or Woman already bought, above the age of twelve years, without
allowance from Authority, shall besides the forfeit of such Indian or Indians,
pay the fine of five pounds to the Treasurer of the Country, and the Constables
of the several towns are ordered forthwith to publish this Order in their
Precincts.

By the COUNCIL, Edward Rawson Secr.
