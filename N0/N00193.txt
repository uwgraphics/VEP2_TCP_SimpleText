AT A GENERAL COURT Held at Boston May 8. 1678.
THis Court, considering how the Lord has been pleased of late Years, by many
ways and means, to humble, and bring low his poor people in this Wilderness,
(...) the Tokens of his great Anger not yet turned away from us, appearing, as
in other respects, so also in a signal manner, in the contagious spreading
Disease of the Small Pox, and other Distempers; whereby many have been taken
away, some Families laid desolate in several places, and sundry of the Lords
precious Servants, his dear Ministers, removed from us; the Lord thereby
threatening to punish our great Wantonness under, and Weariness of, the precious
Liberties and Sanctuary-Priviledges, which we have for a long time enjoyed: And
considering withal, how eminently our Dependence is upon the multitude of the
Lords tender Mercies, for the free pardon of whatever has provoked his holy
and jealous Eye; for the amending what is yet a miss among us in all Orders;
For the preventing of the Fears of those whose eyes are open to observe the
many ways whereby God is provoked, notwithstanding all the means he has used
to humble and heal us; As also, for his Blessing upon our Labors by Sea and
Land, for defeating the Counsels, and rebuking the Malice of the Blood-thirsty
Heathen about us; for the giving a good issue to those matters wherewith our
Worthy Agents are betrusted; for their safe and seasonable Return; And for the
settlement, and future Flourishing of the College, wherein the whole Country
is so much concerned: Considering also the sad and deplorable condition of the
People and interest of Christ Jesus in foreign parts, and the great Rage of
Satan and his instruments in all places:

Do therefore Commend unto the Inhabitants of this Jurisdiction the serious
consideration of the premises, and the seasonable work of deep Humiliation
under the mighty hand of the Lord: And in particular do appoint Thursday, the
sixth Day of June next ensuing, to be solemnly kept as a Day of Humiliation and
Prayer, throughout this Jurisdiction.

Edward Rawson Secr.
