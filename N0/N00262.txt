THE RULE OF THE NEW CREATURE To be Practiced every Day, in all the Particulars
of it which are Ten.

Gal. 6.16. And as many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

Printed at Boston in New England, for Mary Avery, near the Blue Anchor, 1682.

THE RULE OF THE NEW CREATVRE.
BE sensible of thy Original Corruption daily, how it inclines thee to evil,
and indisposeth thee to goods groan under it, and bewail it as Paul did, Rom 7
24.

Also take special notice of your actual sins, or daily infirmities, in
Thought, Word Deed. Endeavor to make your peace with God for them before you
go to bed.

By Repenting, and confessing them to God, working your heart to grief for
them, by some melting considerations, as of Gods goodness to you, the
unreasonableness, and unprofitableness of sin, the prejudice and damage thereof
to the Soul. John 1.19. Believing, or casting your self wholly on Christ's
righteousness, for remission thereof and reconciliation wi^h God, Romans 3 22 24,
25. Cleaving to Gods promises of pardon, and peace, Isai. 43.25. Romans 5.1.
waiting till the Lord shall speak to you* Psalm. 85.8.


II. Get your Union with Christ, and interest Christ cleared and confirmed to
you daily more and more, that you are a Branch in his vine, a Member in his
body, 2 Cor. 13 5.

This may be done three ways,

1. By daily renewal of your Faith, in Christ especially of that act of Faith,
whereby the Soul knits or ties it self unto Christ, casts or roules it self on
Christ for Salvation. Cause your heart in a solemn manner every day to act this
part, or put forth this primitive act of Faith in the view of the whole Soul.
The daily exercise hereof will increase and strengthen the Divine habit of
Faith in the Soul, and make the soul sensible of the very act of it. By
frequent believing you shall feel at your very heart, that you do believe so
shall you have a witness in your self that you are in Christ, 1 John 5.10.

2. By examining your heart upon what grounds you take Christ to be yours.

1. A sight and sense of your sins* of the guilt and power, and punishment of
them, and of your misery by them, Mat. 9.13.

2. Your want of Christ seen, and felt at your very heart, to justify,
sanctify, redeem, save you, else you are utterly lost, and undone
everlastingly, Luke 19 10.

3. Gods free, and general offer of Christ to any that will take him by Faith,
John 3.16.

Manifold promises to this purpose. The ground of all Gods offers, and
donations of Christ, being free Grace, rich Mercy, undeserved Love, Ephesians.
2.4.5.7. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6.

4. Christ's sweet and gracious invitation of such to come unto him as are weary
of sin, Mat 11.28. To buy as have no money, Isai. 55.1. no worth or desert in
themselves.

5. As sinful vile wretches as you are, have been sought of Christ, and found
in Christ, as 1 Cor. 6.9.10, 11. 1 Timothy 1.13. Phil. 3.7.8, 9 why may not you?
the more clearly you discern upon what grounds you take Christ, the more clear
is your title to Christ.

3. By surveying, and observing in what manner you take Christ daily.

1. You do wholly renounce all opinion, and conceit of your own righteousness
and desert, Mark 8.34. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. So that you come to Christ empty of
your self, very vile, yea, nothing in your own eyes, unworthy to receive him.

2. You lay hold on Christ alone with an empty hand of Faith, joining nothing
at all with Christ in the matter of Salvation.

3. You find the Father drawing your heart after Christ. Ioh. 6 44. in hungring
panting desires that will never be satisfied without him; so that the stream
both of your judgment, Phil. 3.7, 8. and affections, 1 Cor. 2.2. Gal. 6.14.
run toward him.

4. You take Christ as a Lord to rule you, as well as a Jesus to save you. Col.
1.6.

As one that is all (...) you your All, your Wisdom your Righteousness, your
Sanctification and Redemption. 1 Cor. 1.30. your spiritual food, Ioh 6.
Raiment, Romans 13 14. Strength, Phil. 4.13. Life, Gal 2.^0. and 3.3.

5 Y^u seek, and wait for Christ, out of the sense of your spiritual penury in
every Ordinance, publ^ck and private, Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Meditation,
Conference, no^ as they are your own works of Sanctification but as they are
Gods Ordinances appointed of purpose for the m^nifestation and communication of
Christ to the soul.

Frequent perusal hereof will clear to you your manner of taking Christ, which
will evidence to you your right in Christ.

III Labor to ^raw and derive from Christ (by the pu^^ing attr^ctive force of
faith,) ability sufficient for the day.

Phil. 4.13. 2 Cor. 3 5. Ioh. 1.16.
1 To perform all the duties. 2 To exercise all the graces. 3 To resi^t and
overcome all the temptation and corruptions. 4 To u^dergo all the trials, and
afflictions thereof.
Make your provision of grace and strength from Christ, every morning, fetch so
much as you shall have occasion to use all the day long, yea and upon all
occasions, that fall out in the ^ay* go to Christ still for the wisdom that
must direct you* for the holiness that must character you, for the shoulder
which must bear them* if they be crosses; for that strength that must resist
them if they be temptations; to perform them if they be duties.

To this end, act your faith daily in the promises of grace and strength, as
Ioh. 1.16. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27. Isai. 44.3. Zech. 10.12. Which are both security
given you by God, that you shall receive grace, and conduit-pipes, or
instruments of conveying the same from Christ unto you.

This is the means to do all in the strength of Christ, and to take forth a
great deal of Christ into your souls, that not you, but Christ may live in you,
Gal. 2.20.

IV. Perform daily duties both in Family and Closet, (especially these three*
of Prayer, Meditation, Reading) with serious intention, heat of affection,
diligence and delight. Ier. 48.^. Mal. 1.41. 1 Chronicles. 21.24. To this end:

1. Watch to these duties* i. e. keep the heart in a good frame for them, Ephesians.
6.18. Undefiled with sin, untainted by the World.

2. Take the fittest time for performance of them all; when you are least dull
and sluggish. Begin the day day constantly with the thoughts of God.

3. Be very real, serious and substantial with God in them; endeavor to feel
all duties at your heart, inlivening, enlarging, inflaming your affections.
These be duties of most importance, and consequence, commodity, and comfort to
the Soul, because they properly aim at, and reach to soul-good, and celestial
happiness, to train up a Soul for heaven.

V. Fortify your selves every morning, against your special lusts to which you
are by nature most prone, or shall be most tempted, be it pride, passion,
coveteousness, etc.

1. By Arguments and holy reasonings within your selves, drawn from the sad
effects thereof, as disprofit discomfort, disgrace, or the like* to discover
the unreasonableness of your sin, and make your Soul ash^med of it. For
example, shall I be proud? then I am sure to fall, for pride goes before a
fall, and God will count me for his enemy, for God resists the proud. Shall I
be angry? If I let passion in, I cannot keep Satan out. Ephesians. 4, 26 27. I shall
grieve the holy Spirit of God, Ep^. 4.30, 31. Shall I be covetous? I cannot but
be very sinful, since the love of money is the root of all evil. 1 (...). 6.10.

2. By pondring in your mind Precepts in Gods Book, against your sin*
judgments threatened, or inflicted for it, on proud Hero^, voluptuous Di^s,
churlish Nabal.

3. By applying promises of mortification close to your (...), as a plaster to
the sore, for subdu^ng your iniquity: Micah 7.16, Romans 6.14

4. By drawing virtue from Christ's death into the soul* which has in it a
killing force of sin, Rom 6.4, 5 6. Phil. 3.10.

5. Get your hearts strongly fixed on God, by trusting on him, Psalm. 112.7. and
submitting to him, 2 Samuel 15.26 1 Samuel* 3.18. against all the fears, cares,
doubts, trials, afflictions of every day; for sufficient to the day is the evil
thereof, Mat. 6.34. To this end.

1. Be prudent to foresee your personal trials and troubles, whatsoever they
are like to be, Prove. 22.3.

2. Go hide and lay up your self in God, ran unto his Name, for God is a Rock
of habitation to which a poor Soul may continually resort, God will give
commandments to save him, Psalm. 71.3. 1 Pet. 4.19.

3. Especially commit that very thing to God, put it in his hands, whatever you
desire to keep, or fear to lose, 2 Timothy 1.12. Be it Life, Liberty, Name,
Friends, Maintenance, etc. what you would have resolved if it be a doubt, Psa.
37.5 or supplied, if it be a want, removed if it be a cross Psalm. 50 15. and
together with the thing, cast all Your care, fear, sorrow and trouble of mind
about wholly on the Lord, Mat. 6.31. 1 Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 55.22.

4. Renew your Faith in those promises every day which most concern your
present states as in promises of supplies if you be in want Psalm. 34 8. and
27.9. and 84.11. Mat. 6.30. of protection, if you be in danger* Psalm. ^4.7. of
direction if in doubt, of deliverance if in trouble, of a good and and
sanctified use of all, Deuteronomy. 8.16. Iam. 5.11. Rom 8.^8. Heb. 12.1^.

5. Labor to see Gods hand, Psalm. 34.9. believe his love, Heb. 12.6. Rev. 3.10
and with all meekness and patience to resign up your self wholly to his will in
every affliction, Mat. 26 39.

VII. Get and keep a savoury relish continually of your Christian privileges,
wherewith you are invested, as you are new creatures in Christ: to wit.

1. Of your dignity, that you are Gods Sons, Christ's Brethren* Heavens Heirs,
partakers of a high and heavenly Calling.

2. Of your Liberty, that you are the Lords Freemen, delivered out of the hands
of all enemies

3. Of your Victory, that you are through Christ more than Conquerors over all
the World of Creatures, 1 Ioh. 5 4. of evils, of temptations, of persecutions,
Romans 8.35, 39.

4. Of your safety, that you have Almighty God for your place of refuge, Psalm.
18.2. a hedge of providence. Job 1.10. a Guard of Angels, Psalm. 91.11. an
enclosure of mercy, Psalm. 2.10. and Gods promise as a writ of protection for
your defense, Heb* 13.5, 6.

5. Of your Riches, as durable substance in heaven, Heb. 10.34 an incorrupt^ble
inher^tance 1 Pet. 1.4. a Kingdom of Glory, a Crown of Life, for you are Heirs
of God, and Co heirs with Christ.

6. Of your joy and pleasure, precious for kind and plentiful for measure,
Psalm. 16.11. peace unconceivable, Phil 4.7. joy unspeakable, 1 Pet. 1.8. the
Masters joy.

Get your hearts affected with all these as being yours: chew and suck them by
serious meditation work and warm them on your hearts by close application
rubbing them into your affections: Oppose these your spiritual privileges to
all your temporal pressures, setting the one against the other as your heavenly
friends to your earthly foes, your high dignity in Christ to your meaner in
outward condition, your wealth above to your want below; your future joys and
rest, to your present troubles and sorrows: This will make you not only patient
under the afflictions of this life, Romans 12.12. but joyful in them, Romans 5.3.
and triumphant over them. 1 Cor. ^5 55. Thus did the Apostles, Romans 8.18. 2
Cor. 4.17, 18, and 6 8, 9, 10 These will provoke to duty, 1 Pet. 2.9, 11* 12
and preserve from fainting, 2 Cor. 4.16, 17 and from trouble of heart, Ioh.
14.1, 2.

VIII. Sanctify God in your heart daily, 1 Pe^ ^.15. make him your fear. Isai
8.14. your love and delight, Psalm. 37.4. To this end.

1. Have often high and honorable thoughts of God, serious meditation of his
glorious Attributes, as his Wisdom, Power, Truth, Mercy Justice, etc. and work
them upon your hearts, that they may echo to them with pure and melting
affections. This will increase and nourish up the Divine nature fast in you.

2. Labor to be affected with all the works of God, as to behold and admire
the Wisdom of God in the creatures, Psalm. 136.5 to see and taste Gods goodness
in every mercy, Psalm. 34.8. to take notice of and tremble at the anger and
displeasure of God in all judgments, Psa. 119.120 Hab 3.16 that you may answer
the dispensations of Gods providence, with suitable dispositions of your hearts
carrying a counterpane in affection to all Gods actions.

3. Wrestle with God by Praying, and believing for an heart of flesh, Ezekiel.
36.26. which will receive impressions from the very thoughts of God in the
mind. Also apply promises of particular affections, as of love, Deuteronomy. 30* 6.
fear, Ier. 3^.40 delight, Isai. 58.14. There is heat and life in these
promises, sufficient to quicken and warm thy dead and frozen affections.

IX. Get a public spirit, to mind the things of Jesus Christ, as naturally as
if they were your own things, Phil. 2.20 21. to look on the things of others,
and prefer Jerusalems welfare before your chiefest joy, Psalm. 137.5, 6, and the
Gospels liberty before your own, as Paul did* to mourn for the sins of the
times, as the godly in Jerusalem did, Ezekiel. 6 4. Especially lay to heart,

1. The Churches misery, when Gods Ordinances go down, and Superstition goes
up, when Gods cause, and side, are put to the worse, when any thing falls out,
which gives a blow to Religion, or proves an impediment to the Gospel, If the
Ark be taken, call your comforts Ichabods, 1 Samuel 4.21.

2. The afflictions of Joseph, Amos 6.6. The sufferings of Gods Servants,
whither Ministers or People, Oh sympathize with them, Heb. 13.3. Nehem. 1, 14.
labor to feel their troubles and sorrows at your very hearts, and pray
earnestly for them, as the Church did for Peter, Act. 12.5:

3. The signs of the times, Mat. 16.3. which hypocrites cannot discern, though
they be well versed in the face of the sky, to wit, the sad symptom and
presages of approaching judgments.

As the commonness of sin, for all sorts transgress in all kind of open
sinfulness, with a high hand against light of nature, and means of grace.

2. Contempt of Gods Ordinances, misusing of his Ministers, 2 Chronicles. 36.16.

3. Departure of Gods glory from his House, Ez^k. 9 3.

4. (...) after former, and under present Judgments, Lev. 26.14.15.

5: The death of many righteous men, Isai. 17.1. the carrying away of others to
hiding places.

6. The vials of Gods wrath poured on the Churches beyond the Seas, Jer. 17.12,
14.

7. An Inundation of spiritual judgments, a spirit of Error, Superstition,
Apostasy, etc. which do commonly end in temporal plagues, Isai. 6.10, 11. Now
the Holy Ghost is a public spirit, breathing, and acting in all the members of
the body mystical. Pray for it, Luke 11.13. believe for it, Gal. 3 14. Ezekiel. 36
27.

X. Get your hearts weaned daily from the world, and from those creatures and
comforts in it, which are dearest and sweetest unto you, as Wife, Children,
Friends, Goods, Liberty, House, Life: this Christ requires of those that follow
him, Luke 14.26, 27. Mark 10.29, 30. this will prepare you either to suffer, or
to die, either of which may put you upon it to lose all.

To this end consider seriously:

First, That these things cannot satisfy your heart, when you have enjoyed
them to the full, Eccl. 4.8. and 5, 10. you soon grow weary of them or glutted
with them; so that you desire some new ^elights, or more of the old, or some
over again.

2. Nor can they sanctify you* but expose you often to many lusts, 1 Timothy 6.9,
10. tentations, distractions to a spirit of the world, and they hinder from
following Christ, Mat. 9.22.

3. Nor can they save you from Gods wrath, from death, or judgment, Prove* 11 4.

4. The wicked whose portion is only here, h^^e often the greatest share of
them, Psalm, 17.14 Job 21.7 to 14.

5. They serve only for this life, whilst we are on this side of the grave*
they shall not be the least ingredients into our celestial happiness. When we
do come to be happy ^n heaven, we shall stand in no need of food, raiment,
physic marriage, etc. Mat. 22.30. for we shall be like the Angels of God in
heaven, we shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, Rev. 7.16. we shall
live by the alsufficient Spirit of God, which never needs refreshing; we shall
be clothed with long white (...), of immortality, Rev. 7.9. In a word, when we
come to heaven, the place of Gods habitation, we shall enjoy the face and
beatifical presence of the most glorious Jehovah, blessed for ever, as an
object wherein all the powers of the Souls will be satisfied with in effable
delight, and everlastingness, God will be unto us All in All, 1 Cor. 15.28.
