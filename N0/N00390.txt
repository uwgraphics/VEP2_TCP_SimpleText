AT THE CONVENTION Of the Governor and Council, and Representatives of the
Massachusetts Colony
IT having pleased the God of Heaven, to multiply still the Tokens of his Holy
and Righteous Displeasure against us, not only by the whole Series of his
Providence toward us, in the Summer past; but also by the growing
Difficulties of a Distressing Indian War; in which our Barbarous Enemies,
notwithstanding utmost Endeavors that have been used to leave them inexcusable
in their continuing Hostility, are yet invading of us; and now flusht with such
success of their Attempts, and increase of their Numbers, as threatens a
spreading of that unhappy Flame into diverse Corners of the Land; unless the God
of Armies graciously smile upon the present Expedition against them; Unto all
which uncomfortable circumstances, there is added as yet more Ominous, our own
extreme unpreparedness for the Mercies of God, by our continuance in those
provoking Evils which have drawn Divine Judgments upon us; so that our only
hopes of Deliverance are in his Sovereign Grace, who when we go on frowardly in
the way of our own hearts, can see our ways and heal us.

Upon Consideration whereof, together with the present Circumstances of the
State of Europe: It is Ordered, That Thursday, the Nineteenth Day of this
Instant September; be Observed as a Day of Humiliation, with Fasting and Prayer
throughout this Colony; And that all Servile Labor be therefore every where on
that Day forborne. And it is hereby Recommended unto the Churches, Ministers and
People in the several Towns and Villages, that they solemnly apply themselves
unto the Duties of the Day; humbly imploring the Blessing of God upon their
most Gracious Majesty's, King William, and Queen Mary, with the whole English
Israel; and that Gods Presence and Blessing may also be with and upon our
Forces gone and going forth to engage against our Pagan Adversaries. And that
he would farther grant those many other both Spiritual and Temporal Blessings,
which Tend unto our full Establishment.

By Order of the Governor and Council, etc. Isaac Addington, Secr.
Boston, September 7th. 1689.
