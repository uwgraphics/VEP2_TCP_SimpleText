THE MILITARY GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN, etc.
INTRODUCTORY CHORUS.
Triumphant Fame ascend the Skies,
Ever glorying in our Isle,
Loud proclaim over distant Realms
How BRITISH POWER, and BRITISH GLORY rise.
Enter first Speaker; proclaiming Britannia Conqueror, by Way of Introduction
to the next Speech. AS down the plain with easy Tide,
The Streams, when unmolested, placid glide;
But, when descends a sudden Shower,
They pour amain a foaming Flood;
The Mountains hear the Torrents roar,
And Echoes shake the neighboring Wood:
So mild and peaceful, fair Britannia moved
Her harmless Scepter; 'till, her Wrath enflamed,
GALLIA all her Vengeance proved;
Haughty LEWIS' s Rage was tamed
Envy and Terror; seized the hostile Nations round,
CHORUS II.
Gallia's Sons shall vaunt no more,
Her Armies broake, her Fleets destroyed
Gallic Power,
And Gallic Pride
In vain our injured Arms defied
Enter second Speaker; who enumerates several of the most important Conquests
of GREAT BRITAIN, with Encomiums on some of the principal Generals. It is not
mine to raise with forming Hand,
A mute Encomium on its marble Base;
But yet in humble Phrase I Will dare rehearse
The mighty Deeds of Britain's conquering Arms:
What could avail Monongahela's Rage,
Commencement, in Nassau Hall in New Jersey, Sept.r 29.th 1762
Chorus 2, Allegro

Gallia's Sons shall vaunt no more, shall vaunt no more,^
her Armies broke her Fleets destroyed;^
Gallic Power and Gallic Pride:^
In vain our injured Arms defied, in vain our injured Arms defied.^


Though glutted to the full with Blood indignant,
If in the Breast of Warlike JOHNSTON lay
Unerring Thunders of a just Revenge?
To Him no Mean Reward of Honor's due;
Since that glad Day, the first auspicious, shed
A Tide of Glory over the Western World.
Hence what new Triumphs in Succession crowd
Our smiling Annals! Gracious Powers indeed,
To spin out such a Length of prosperous Fate!
Immured in brazen Walls, Canadia's Hope,
Stood Louisburg; whose towering Bulwark s braved,
In bold Defiance, Victory itself;
But, not great WOLF, and AMHERST; Sons of War,
Whose very Names struck Terror on the Foe.
But, ah! let not the Ardour of thy Youth,
Uncoscious WOLF, with such Precipitance,
Ever yet thy full Carreer of Glory's run,
Urge thee on Dangers, -- but 'twas thus ordained.
Such Blood Canadia's Plains never stained before;
Nor happier Genius ever rose to Fame;
His Death, itself, the Expiation slew;
WOLF, dying, conquered; conquering, was immmortal.
Nor ceases Victory; AMHERST still appears,
Illustrious from a Train of glorious Deeds:
Him prudent Foresight, and sagacious Cares
Led though the Perils of a savage War:
'Twas but to show the Glittering of his Arms,
And Montreal with all Canadia yields.
Hence a long Tract of Continent subdued:
The ruthless Natives champ the reigning Curb
And break their Arrows with indignant Rage.
What shall I say of Afric's torrid Coast
Where the parched Adder gasps for Life? or what,
Of Laurels gathered in those golden Climes,
Where the first Sun beskirts the Eastern Clouds,
And where the Roman Eagle never flew?
What shall I say of all the wondrous Deeds,
Of which Germania's Witness? As, when falls
Resistless Eurus on the Baltic Main,
The heaving Billows, of enormous Weight,
Dash, like projected Mountains, full against
The unyielding Shore; thus, with impetuous Tide,
Poured the whole Force of Gaul on Hanoveria;
And had overwhelmed it: But the mighty Soul
Of FERDINAND, as Atlas firm, withstood;
And broke the Vehemence of the pressing War.
So, the spent Ocean weakened with the Rage
Which long had urged the stable Continent,
Falls back at length, and in itself subsides.
Shall I again repeat the brave Exploits
Of MONCKTON in the Western Isles? those late,
Within these peaceful Walls we sung, enflamed,
With all the Ardours of a Patriot Heart:
But MONCTON'S Deeds demand repeated Songs.
Nor should I pass in Silence Guadaloupe,
Belle-Isle, or what the British Flag achieved,
Whether it thundered on the Gallic Coast;
Or rode in Triumph over the boundless Main.
Surprising Series of renowned Exploits!
A GOD, a GOD directs th'Affairs of Men.
What then avails Iberia's Insolence,
So often surpress'd by our superior Arms,
Fraught with almighty Aid? While British Sons,
Inured to Toils heroic, burn with Love
Of honorable Fame, nor Power, nor Threats*
Shall damp their ardour in their bold Career.
CHORUS III
Propitious Powers who guard our State,
Let our earnest Prayer be heard;
Our Prayer this solemn Day preferred.
Check the Force and Pride of Spain;
Render all her Efforts vain,
But Power and Glory be BRITANNIA 's Fate.
Enter EUGENIO; who, by Way of Dialogue with CLEANDER, gives an Account of the
Reduction of the Havanna. EUGENIO. Have thou not heard CLEANDER, of the Deeds
So late performed by ALBEMARLE? These, sure
Methinks demand their equal Tribute
Of Commendation; such as thou can give.

CLEANDER. I have EUGENIO; nor has Gratitude
To HIM who rules omnipotent the World
For such amazing Fortune of our Arms,
Been wanting to my Breast; But yet the Theme
Seemed worthy of a more exalted Muse;
Chorus 3.d Largo

Propitious Powers who guard our State,^
Let our earnest Prayer be heard;^
Our Prayer this solemn Day preferred.^
Check the Force and Pride of Spain;^
render all her Efforts vain,^
But Power and Glory be Britannia's Fate,^
but Power and GLory be Britannia's Fate.^


A Muse like thine, enobled by the Love
Of British Freedom, and of British Fame.
Wherefore without Reluctance bear thy Part
In such illustrious Praise.

EUGENIO In Britain's Praises who can be reluctant?
Whilst I have Lungs to heave, a Tongue to speak,
I Will not be wanting to my Country's Cause.
Here, Silence would be base Ingratitude;
Nay, more, Rebellion.

CLEANDER. But say, EUGENIO, how that warlike Youth,
Such glorious Conquest gained.

EUGENIO Greater the Toil, the greater Weight of Glory*
No easy Effort gains the Alpine Summits,
Secured by rugged Dangers; high enclosed
In cliffy Bulwarks; each its' Towering Head
In Clouds invelop'd, inaccessible.
Full forty Days beneath the stormy Brow
Of MORO-CASTLE moved the British Troops.
With various Art, and regular Approach
Working Destruction and sure Victory.
From Batteries on every Side erect,
The mounted Engines poured incessantly
Against her strong built Walls their iron Force;
Thick Showers of Bombs implete with nitrous Death,
Rained on their Heads defenseless, which forthwith,
Bursting, disploded Ruin; every Art,
Which military Prudence pointed out,
Or Valor might perfect, was tried:
But still the Foe with stubborn Pride resist;
Still, reinforced, guard their battered Walls
From close Assault; and, often sallying forth,
Would check the approaching Siege; as often repulsed.
At length ensues a Breach; their Arms appear;
And all their mighty Secrets are revealed.
Again, the cavern'd Ground beneath their Feet,
With Grain sulphurious stored, by sudden Blaze,
Bursts ruinous; up fly the Hopes of War,
In smoky Whirls involved; the uprooted Wall,
A larger Chasm displays; the Fosse, filled up
With shivered Rubbish, gives a fairer Entrance,
And seems t'invite the meditated Storm.
Then had you seen, CLEANDER, all the Fire
Of British War, enflamed by fierce Revenge.
As furious Lions pressed with hungry Rage,
Leap roaring on the hopeles Prey; so rushed
The ardent Victors; bloody Shouts ascend;
And Slaughter, Slaughter rends the vaulted Sky;
They kill; they conquer; Death in every Shape,
Confounds the affrighted Foe; some in Despair
His Fury tempt, while others shrink away,
And, trembling, merit an inglorious End.

CLEANDER. A just Reward of Spanish Cruelty,
So late exerted, when their merc'less Hands,
At the first landing of our Arms, they drenched
In captive British Blood.

EUGENIO. A just Reward CLEANDER. Nor here ceased
The vigorous Effort; animated now
With recent Conquest, our Commanders brave
Press on to total Victory. (Glorious Toils!
Well worthy of immortal Fame!) straightway,
With Force collected, and a martial Rage
Even passing British, on the unyielding Town
They turn the Charge decisive; and, at once,
Lend all the Thunders of their various War.
In vain the Foe resist; all Hope is fled;
Their Cannon faintly roar; the laboring Walls,
Fall piecemeal crumbling to the Ground: within
Reign grizly Horror, loud Laments, and Death.

CLEANDER. Such then EUGENIO was their desperate Fate!
What can withstand our all pervading Arms
When Heaven ensures the Conquest?
Such Glory to Britannia's Sons is due.

CHORUS IV.
Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame,
For ever crown BRITANNIA 's Name.
Sound her Praise;
Her Honors raise;
Her Triumphs in IBERIA 's Seas.
Chorus 4.th Piu Allegro

Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame,^
Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame,^
forever crown Britannia's Name.^
crown Britannia's Name.^
crown Britannia's Name.^
Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame,^
forever crown Britannia's Name;^
Sound, sound her Praise, her Honor raise, her Triumphs in Iberias Seas^


Enter fourth Speaker; suddenly transported. What mean these Strains? these
glad, triumphant Sounds?
My Heart, with what unusual Joy it bounds!
It Is Transport all; BRITANNIA 's Praise,
BRITANNIA 's Praise my Soul inspires;
Oh, how my Bosom 'glows with unknown Fires,
Collecting Fual as they blaze!
Down the long Tract of future Time I view
Effulgent British Glory shine,
Unceasing as the Stars! --
I see portray'd in every various Hue
The Gallic and Iberian Wars;
Here, Gallia trembling on her Throne;
Her Shame, there, proud Iberia own;
While in the midst, with radiant Crown
BRITANNIA 's Splendors almost dazzle the Design.
Ye Sons of War, pursue the Foe;
Your ALBEMARLE has struck the auspicious Blow.
See, Victory waits with laurel-Wreath to crown
Your Temples; fondly hovering round
Your glittering Arms. It Is Courage fights,
It Is Courage conquers. Pour your Wrath abroad;
With martial Sound
The Foe confound;
Assert your British Right;
And bid them feel the Weight of your avenging Rod.
Part of the Fourth CHORUS.
Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame,
Forever crown Britannia's Name.
Enter fifth Speaker; who closes the whole with a solemn Wish, for the
continued Prosperity of the British Nation. While on their Base the eternal
Mountains stand,
And poise the balanced Globe; while Nature's Laws command,
The fixed Alternative of Night and Day;
While Sun and Moon and Stars endure,
And on our World their Radiance pour;
May British Lands exulting see
The full Rewards of Victory;
Great in the Annals of Eternity.
Part of Chorus 4.th Piu Allegro.

Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame, Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame^
for ever Crown Britannia's Name, crown Britannia's Name, crown Britannia's
Name^
Glory, Triumph, Victory, Fame for ever crown Britannia's Name.^
Chorus 5.th to be sung in the Tune of Chorus 3.d Allegro.

While Mountains poise the balanced Globe,
Shade and Light the World enrobe:
While Sun and Moon and Stars endure.
And a blonded Radiance pour,
British Fame shall bear the Prize:
And in a Blaze of peerless GLory rise.


Long may a GEORGE the regal Scepter sway;
And scatter Blessings with a liberal Hand
Around the peaceful Globe; but dire Dismay
On all who dare his injured Arms withstand.
CHORUS V.
While Mountains poise the balanced Globe,
Shade and Light the World enrobe;
While Sun, and Moon, and Stars endure,
And a blended Radiance pour,
BRITISH FAME shall bear the Prize;
And in a Blaze of peerless Glory rise.
FINIS.
