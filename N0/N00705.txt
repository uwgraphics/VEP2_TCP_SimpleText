I. A few OBSERVATIONS for the very Novices, Readers and Writers.
1. A Vowel makes a Syllable, with or without any other Letter, as, I a^ a
Man. ^^hel is not (...).

2. The like does a Diphthong (or two Vowels, which have no Consonant between
them) as, aw, ay, easy, either, ours or yours.

3. But a Consonant cannot make a Syllable it self (...) must needs have a
Vowel before or behi^d (...) the Interjection (...) wher^by we bi^ (...) be
silent.

4. (...) is a perfect Sound, mad^ like as the (...) Observations do declare.

5. According to th^r Primmers, no Syllable contains (in the English Tongue)
above eight Letters, as, (...), ^houldst, strength, but I am constrained to
except the Streights of Calice.

6. A word consists of one or more S^ll^bles, never above seven, see page 7.

7. A word has as many Syllables as there are Vowels in it, as, Pe^^silvania
in America.

Except 1. (...) Vowels and Diphthongs, (...) be esteemed a good peac^able
Co^^try,

Exc 2. If it (...) in ^ or es, be^a^se God multiplies there (...) Mercies more
and more,

Exc3. 3 (...) after g and q, (...) some by the guidance of a meek and qui^t
Spirit are come out of all Qua^relings.

8. The Conso^ant of the following Syllable ought to be (...) with the
foregoing Vowel (...)* (...), (...), C^-lamity, but PRON UNCE Col-lour,
Mod-dest, Callamity.

9. Every Diphthong and double Letter makes his Syll^ble (...) as in good,
redeem, ^eather, (...), (...)

Except 1. (...) at the words end, as ^n labor, savior, vert^^^^, dangerous.
2. (...) in bargain, certain, fountain, (...). 3. (...). 4. (...) in build, buy.

10. For facilities sake, we say, ^usted for worsted, vi^les for victuals*
(...) for handkerchief, da^der for dandruff, (...) for (...) tree, 'ent for is
not.

11. All Sentences and proper Names begin with Capital Letters, as, By ^aith
Abel, Enoch No^h, Abraham, Sarah, ^saac, Jacob, Joseph* Moses, Ra^a^, G^deon,
Bar^k, Sampson, (...) David, Samuel, and others, pleased (...) Heb. ^^.

12. The three ^old Accent, viz. the Circumflex (^) which insisteth very long
upon a S^llable: The Acute (') which insisteth, not with so full a sound as the
former: The Grave (') which insisteth very little, are obvious enough in the
Pronunciation, but the Characters thereof not yet seen by me in English
Writings. I am present to present*

II. The most Common ABBREVIATIONS.
and, and; etc. and so ^orth; h* ^oly; viz. to (...); i. e. that is to say* q.
d. as if he should say; with, with* which, which; (...)* meant; ye, the, ^t, that;
you, thou; yr, your; ym, them; wn when; over, over: though, though; I Am, I am*
I Have, I have; I Will* I will; he will, ^e will; we'll, ^e will; I don't I do not;
it is, it is; there'^* there is; would, would; I heard 'em say, (...); h^n't,
has (...)* shall not shall not; his man's run away (...)* (...) b'w'e, God be with
you* men o'th Country, of the Country.

III. POINTS of DISTINCTION To be observed in Reading and Writing, for k^eping
the Sense.
A Comma (,) is a little stop or breathing. A Semi-colon (;) is a Stop
somewhat longer.

(:) A Colon is, ^^lf a Period, commonly put in the middle of a sentence, like
as (...)

(.) A Period, or full stop, at the end thereof. As for Example,

Little Children, it is the last Time: And as (...) heard, that Antichrist
shall come, even now are there many Ant^^christs; wherefore we kn^w* that it is
the last (...). ^ John 2. 18. ^

VI.
PROVERBS are so far from being inconsistent with Truth, that they are rather
delightful words of Truth, as goads and nail^ fastened by the Masters of
Assemblies, to admonish the Sons and Daughters of men, Eccles. 12 10. more
precious Monuments and Relics of (...) Times, than all the Statues and (...)
Rags worshipped by P^pish Idolat^^^. Proverbs are wrinkled and gray hair'd
Sayings of our most experienced and judicious Ancestors, often containing a
whole and wholesome Sermon in seven words: Golden Money, (so called from
admonishing) of an old Coin, yet nevertheless current still in our Age, and
harmlesly coveted after, even by such who hate Covetousness. Solomon, that wise
and famous King of Israel, set many thereof in order, Eccles. 12. 9. and spoke
himself three Thousand, 1 Kings 4 32 Paul, that eminent Apostle of Christ, and
other divine Penmen, used Proverbs, yea, of proph^ne Writers and Poets, Acts
17 28, 1 Cor. 15 33. Tit. 1 12. 2 P^t. 2. 22. Not many years ago, the most
Noble and tried man of our Day and Generation that ever mine Eyes did see,
bestowed some hours of his solitude and retirement, in digesting a little Book
full, well deserving the Re-impression in this part of the world, and to be
translated into other Languages, as it is already in the German Tongue. I being
provided with a good store of all ^orts of the like sharp and witt^ Apothegm or
short Sentences, (which under Thousand Heads I collected when yet a Lad and
Schol^^ was willing to insert any thereof in this place* but seeing the next
preceding (...) beyond expectation, and I not (...) within my self to (...)
the same: (rather to add these following f^^ words, viz.

That Peace and Mercy will be upon all who walk according to that Rule,
converting holy Words in holy Works, showing thereby their Faith. For though
the just do live by Faith, Romans 1. 17. yet that Faith must be coupled with
Charity, or it pro^iteth nothing, 1 Cor. 1^. 2. 2 Pet. 1. ^. It must have
Works, or it is dead by it self, James 2. 17. Love and good Works, the certain
Mark of Discipleship, and unavoidable Effects of Regeneration. Works not of the
Law, but of the Gospel, which Christ work^^h in h^s Saints by his holy Spirit.
Whosoever has not that Spirit, is no Christian, Romans 8. 9. and all these, who
are past feeling, Reprobates, 2 Cor. 13 5. Ephesians. 4. 19) I therefore at present
omit PROVERBS, reserving them for another more seasonable Opportunity, in case
these my first Fruits prove not fruitles^, and meet with a kind and candid
Reception, which I submissively hope for.
