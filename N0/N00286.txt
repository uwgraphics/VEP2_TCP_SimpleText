AT A General Court Held at Boston, January 28. 1684.
WHereas the Law concerning Building with Brick or Stone in Boston, seems to
Prohibit all manner of Building or Buildings, though never so small of Wood or
Timber; And in regard there is a necessity of many convenient Places about
Houses to be built for shelter, which cannot be conveniently done with Brick or
Stone:

This Court does Order, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person or
Persons to Erect any small Building; Provided, it do not exceed eight Foot
square, and seven Foot Studd, of Wood or Timber; any Law to the contrary
notwithstanding: Provided they have the Approbation of the Select-men of said
Town.

By the COURT, Edward Rawson, Secr'.
