Faith and PRACTICE.

According to the Testimony of Holy SCRIPTURES.

Given forth from the Yearly Meeting at Burlington the 7th of 7th Month, 1692.
by the despised Christian People, called Quakers.

Printed and Sold by William Bradford in Philadelphia, 1693.

SECTION I. Of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
WE believe in Ephesians. 4.^5 6. 1 C^r 12.4.5.6. Col. 1 16.
one God, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, and in one holy Spirit, and that these
three are one true God, the Maker and Great^r of all things, visible and
invisible.

That God is no Body, but a pure Joh. 4.24 1 John 1.5. Deuteronomy. ^0.2 ^* Ps 117.4
5. Act. 15 18. P^. 130.1 ^ 6 7. Joh. 21.17. Acts 1.24.
Spirit, Light and Life, eternal and uncha^geable, of infinite Perfection in
Wisdom, Goodness, Power, Justice and Holiness, knowing all things past, present
and to come, present in all things, and able to do all things whatsoever he
pleases.

That God has fore-known Romans 8.29 3^. Ephesians 1.4.5. 1 Pet. 1.2.
all who are or shall be saved, from the beginning of the World to the end of
it, having chosen them in Christ Jesus before the Found^t^^^ of the World, to
be Holy, and (...) H^liness and Sanctification of the Spirit unto Eternal Li^e
and Glory.

That as Gods Love and Grace is freely extended unto ^
all, whereby th^^ may be saved, and none are excluded from the possibility of
Salvation by any De^^^e of absol^^^ Reprobationpunc; so who^ve^ (...) shall be
saved, from the (...) of the World to the end of (...), they a^e saved by
Ephesians. 2.^
Grace* (...) Faith, and not o^ themselves, (...) is the (...) God.

And that not only Christ Isa. 42.1 1 Pet. 2.6.
is Gods E^^ct, but a^l 2 Timothy (...) Romans 9.23 ^ap. 11.7. and ^8.29 3^.3^.32 1
These. 1.4.
that shall be saved, from ^he beginning of the world to the end of it, are
Gods Ele^t, chosen in Christ, (...) Elect Head and Root, as his E^ect ^ody and
Members, according to (...) re-knowledge and Counsel of God, not only before
they believe and repen^, but before the Foundation of the World; yet as with
respect to men's knowledge, they are said to be Gods Elect who are Sanctified
and Renewed, or ^^rn again, and such are Gods Elect who cry day and ^ight unto
him, whom he will aveng^, L^ke 1^.^. and who pu^ o^, being the Elect of God,
and holy and ^^^oved, ^owels of M^ry, ^indness H^mbleness o^ Mind, Meekn^ss,
Lo^g-Suffering, etc Col. 3.12.

SECT. II. Of Man, before and after the Fall.
WE believe That Man consists of a ^sa. ^5^ 16.
created Soul and body, and that the Soul of man is neither God nor the Devil,
nor any part or m^asu^e either of God or the Devil, but an invisible Spirit,
endued with Reason and Understandi^g* Will, Affections, Memory, and Power of
Motion, capable to serve and obey God, by the help of his Grace, and to receive
the Romans 6.21.22. Luke 16.22, 23.
Fruit of his Obedience, which is Life; or capable to disobey and transg^ess,
and to receive the frui^ of his Disobedience, which is Death. And that ^he Romans
6.21.22. Luke 16.22, 23.
So^l dies not with the Body, but surviveth after it.

That God made man upright, after his Genesis 1* 2^. cap. 3.22. 1 Cor. 1^.21.
Image, Male and Female, and gave him dominion over the works of his hands, and
g^ve him a Law, which if he had obeyed, he had lived forever.

That both the Genesis 2.17. cap. 3.1^ 17.^8.19. R^m 5.12.
Death of the s^ul unto Righteousness, and Bodily Sick^^ss and Death came by
the Fall of Man, with many other Calamities, and that by one man sin ^ntred
into the World, and Death by sin, etc. and a seed of sin and defilement is sown
by the Enemy in the hearts of Adams Posterity, but yet ^h^t is not imputed to
Damnation, but to such only as obey it.

SECT. III. Of Restoration by Jesus Christ, and Faith in him.
WE believe, That Jesus Christ is the Prove. 8 23 24. c^p. 3.4. Mich. ^.2. Jo^
^.25. Ne^. 9.^. Jo^. 1^.26.
Son of God, and the only begotten of God from Everlasting, and one God with
the Father; and that he was the Redeemer and Savior of (...) that be^ie^ed in
him from the begi^ni^g of the Wo^ld, and gave them the ho^y Spi^^t to r^new and
sanctifi^ them, and that this holy Spirit did ^roceed from the Father and from
the Son.

and that in the fullness of time Christ took on him the Heb. 2.1^. Gal. 4.4*
Gen 3 15. Mat 8.20 21 25.
Seed ^f Abraham, and was made of a Woman made under the Law, the promised Seed
of the Woman, that should be (...) of the Serpent, and was conceived of the
holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary.

That Christ, as Man, had and now has the true and entire Nature of Man, both
of Mat 26 38. Joh 2 ^9, 2^, 21. Col 2.9.
Soul and Body, and that neither his Soul nor Body is the Godhead, but the
Temple of it.

That he Rom 4 25 1 Cor 15 3.4.5. Col. 1.2^. Romans 5.11 1 John 2.2.
dyed for our sins, and rose again for our Justification, and by the Blood of
his Cross made Peace for us, and was a Sacrifice of Atonement unto God, and a
Proputation, not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole World.

That he rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven without us, in the same
Body for Rom 6 9. Phil 3 21. Acts 1 11* cap 3 20 21 Acts 10.42 cap. 17.31* ^
T^m 4.1^ 1 Pet. 4.5.
being, which was crucified, and buried, but most wonderfully and most
gloriously changed in Manner and Condition. And that in the same Body ( i. e. a
heavenly glorious and immo^tal body he will come and appear without us to judge
the quick and the dead.

(...) John 2.12, 14, 16* 17. John 8 24. cap 14 1.2. Gal 3 ^6 and 4 5 3^ 31 1 John 4 2 cap 5 1 4 5 6
Faith in Christ Jesus as he came without us in the flesh, and dyed for our
sins, and rose again, and is gone into Heaven, and there remains our Advocate
and Mediator with the Father, in whom all ^ullness of Grace and truth dwell^th,
as well as he does inwardly (...) in^o ou^ hearts to enlighten and quicken us,
is necessary to make a true Christian, and to bege^ us unto God, so as to be
his Children, born of the Freewoman, Jerusalem from above; and that without
this Faith none can be so bo^n no^ h^ve the Spirit of Adoption, wi^nessing to
them that they are the Children of God.

That the true James 2 14, 17, ^^
Faith in Christ Jesus, ^s he dyed for us and r^se ag^in, i^ not a b^re
hi^torical and litteral Faith, such as Hypocrites and false Christians have,
but is a l^^ing and frui^f^^ Faith, conforming them who have it to Ch^i^t
jesus, to ^^ve and walk as he did, and tha^ this Faith is wrought in all who
have it by the (...) Rom 10 8 9 2 Cor. 4 13 Co. 2 ^2
Faith in the Heart, and by the Spi^^t of Faith, and by (...) mighty (...) God
that rai^ed (...) dead; and that in Gods o^dinar^ way of worki^^, Rom 10 17 1
Cor 1 2. (...)
this Faith i^ w^ought and beg^^ in men (...) of Christ (...) that be wanting,
by the Testimony of the holy Scriptu^es, in reading or hearing them read.

That Gal 32 14 22 ^3. Col 1 6 27 Ephesians 3 17 18. Acts 10 44 45 1 Cor 12 4 5 6 2
Cor 3 7* 8, 9. Romans 1, 2.21* 22 Psalm. 147 19* 20.
all who are true and sincere Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, as he dyed
for us and rose again, are under a peculiar and special Ministration of the
Spirit, and have peculiar Illuminations and Revelations of God, and many
peculiar and special Operations, Influences, Gifts, and Fruits of the Spirit,
that none others have, however just and conscientious they may be in their mere
Gentile state under the Law, and Ministration thereof, such as Co^^^lius was
before he received the Faith of Christ, by Peter's Preaching.

That John 1* 9. Romans 1.18, 19, 20. cap 2, ^^
Christ the true Light does lighten every man that comes into the World, and
that by his general Illumination, common to all Mankind he does convince, teach
and instruct all who give attendance unto the same, the things concerning God,
and their Duty to him, as Creator, and does reprove for Sin and Disobedience,
and brings them under the Law, and Ministration thereof, which is of a saving
nature and tendency in a general way; and this Law is as a Gal. 3.24^
Schoolmaster to bring men (who give ^eed to it) (...) Christ, that they might
be Justified by Faith.

That none who are sincere, according to the Mark 4 25. John 3.19.20. James 4
6. Rom 5.18. cap 1.8 9. Phil. 1.6. Acts 10 34 35.
l^ast measure of Light given to them, if they continue to follow the Lord, can
fall short of eternal Life and Salvation; for he will lead them from one degree
of Light and Grace to another (as he led Israel of old out of Egypt, through
the red Sea, and the Wilderness, and through Jordan to the promised Land) until
he who has begun his good Wo^k of Salvation in them, bring it to Perfection.

That Christ Romans 10.8, 9. Deutr. 30.14.15. Heb. 7.25 26. Mat. 1.21. 1 Timothy 2.5.
the Word and the Light is in every man (though not revealed or known as such)
and is sufficient to save every man, but Christ whole and undivided is our
All-sufficient Savior, able to save to the uttermost all that come to God by
him; and as Christ without us, as he dyed and rose again, and is ascended, and
is our Mediator with God in Heaven, does not save us without christ in us, so
nor does Christ in us save us without Christ without us, the which Christ is
one, the Fullness John 1 15, 16.
without us in the Man Christ Jesus, and the measure of him in u^; and the
measure Ephesians. 4 7 13 16. Cant 5 4 Mat 3 12
of the heavenly Gift of Christ works savingly in us, by the Power and
Strength of the Fullness; and none witness Christ perfectly to save them, but
who have Romans 10.8 9.10. John 3 14 15.36. cap 12 32* 33 36*
Faith in him as he dyed and rose again, and is gone into Heaven, and there
remains our Advocate and M^diator, as well as that they believe in him as he
is spiritually present in them, to enlighten, quicken and sanctify them.

That as the Sufficiency of Christ's Light and Grace within every man is not to
be set up in Opposition to Christ without us, who has all fullness of Light,
Grace and Truth dwelling in him, and of whole John 1 15 6 Mark ^ 25 1 Cor 9 8.
James 4 6 1 Pet 1 2.
Fullness we all receive Grace for Grace; so nor is the present measure of
Light and Grace received, to be set in Opposition to f^rther measures of Light
and Grace yet to be received.

And the Sufficiency that any has of Grace, is for the present time, and not
for all time to come; and therefore every one is to wait Isa 42* 29* 31
in the present measure already received, and by the help of the fame to pray
to God in Joh 14 13. cap 16 ^3 ^4 Mat 7 7.8, Col 2 3
the Name of Christ Jesus, to receive a daily and hourly supply from God, out
of Christ's Fullness (as out of a most rich Treasury or Storehouse) of mo^e
Grace, that so he who has begun his good Work in them, having given them a
small measure of Grace, may carry it on in them to Perfection, by his giving
them a daily supply and increase of more Grace, which they shall all receive,
as they wait and pray for it, being found in all diligent Obedience unto his
present Requiring^.

SECT. IV. Concerning Justification and Sanctification.
WE believe, that Acts 13 3^ ^9 cap ^6 18 (...) 5 9 Ro^ 5 1 ^
Faith, Repentance, Love, Hope, etc* and sincere Obe^i^n^e to Gods Command^,
although the^ are necessary Conditions and Qualifications required, in order to
our Justification and Remission of sins, yet the ^ate not the Foundation of it,
but CHRIST alone is the Foundation thereof, in whose Name, (as he dyed for us
and rose again.) Acts 4 12 1 Cor 3 11,
Repentance and Remission o^ sin is to (...) preached and through Faith in his
Name, his Luke 24 46 47
Obedience and Righteo^sness, as he dyed for us, and became Obedient unto the
Death of the Cross, is Rom 3 24. cap 4, 5, 6* 7* 1^. Rom 5 16, 18* 10 Phil 3 8
9, 10. Romans 8.34.
imputed or a^counted to us for R^missi^n (...) sin and Justification; 1 Cor:
6*9 10 11.
And none are justified but who are sanctified.

That though there is a Luke 8.^3.
Faith that may be lost and fallen from, yet there is a degree in 1 Pet. 1 7
Faith and S^^ctification, which the Soul having attained, does not lose nor
fa^l from it, and that is the Faith that is ^ore preci^us t^an Gold that
perishet^, which being ^ryed with the Fire, endures to the end o^ all
Temptations.

That a Mat 12 20 Rom 6 18 22. cap 8 2 3
Victory over sin, and a Freedom from it, i^ possible to be obtained by the
Grace o^ God, here in this mortal ^od, the which Victo^y and Freedom is not
received nor witness^d Phil 2 12 and 15
(...) at once, ^ut g^aduall^; and the sooner it i^ witnessed that m^n are the
more d^l^ge^t in the imp^^vement of God^ Grace, and all ^el^s and Means that
God has (...) for the same; and it is most sa^e for (...) to have a Holy
Jealo^^ie over themselves* that they ex^eed not in thinking of themselves above
wh^t is convenient, but to fo^low the Example of Paul, who said, 1 Cor 4 4
I know nothing by my sel^, yet I am not hereby justified, but he that judges
me is the Lord; and of Job, who said, Job 9 21
T^ough I were Perfect, yet would I not know my Soul.

SECT. V. Concerning the True Worship of God, and True Ministry.
WE believe, that Mat 4 ^0 1 Cor 1 2 ^ 1 Timothy 1 12 Rev 1 4 5 Acts 7 ^9 Ephesians 6 18
God and Christ, and the holy Spirit are only to be worshipped and prayed unto,
as one entire Object of Worship, Prayer and Thanksgiving; and that a^l true
Worship, Prayer and Thanksgiving is to be performed by the Rom 8 26 John 4 4 1
Cor 12 3 cap 14 15
help of Gods Spirit, as it is inwardly felt to move and enable unto the same,
and that ^his h^lp is to be waited for in true silence and sti^lness, from all
our own Thoughts, and all S^lf-movings, and Self-strivings and Workings in the
mee^ Will and Power of Man.

That none are true Ministers of Christ, but who are 1 Timothy 3.2, 3, 4. Tit 1
7.8.9 2 Pet. 1 21 Mat 10 8 2 Cor 11 7
holy Men, who speak as they are moved by the h^ly Spirit, and are qualified
and endued with sound Kn^wledge, Power and Virtue; and that the Gospel is to be
preached freely, without requiring or exacting any thing for the same.

SECT. VI. Concerning the Commandments of God and Christ, and the holy
Scriptures.
WE believe, that besides the general Commandments of God, of Piety, Justice
and Temperance, given under the Law, briefly contained (for matter and
substance) in the Ten Commandments, the Rom 2 15
Work or Effect of which is writ on the hearts of all men, There are some
special Precepts and Commandments of God and Christ given to us under the
New Testament, as Mat. 5 34 38.39. cap 19 9.8. 2 Cor 10 4 James 4.1 2 Heb 1^.9.
1 John 3 23 Jer 31.3^. Heb 8.1^. Ephe. ^2.7.
Not to Swear at all, Not to fight with Carnal Weapons, Not to pay Tithes, nor
to practice a^y pa^^ o^ the Ceremonial (...), nor to have more Wives than one
at one time; and also to believe the Do^^rine of Christ, as delivered by Christ
and his holy Prophets and Apostles, in all the parts of it, and recorded in the
holy Scriptures. And the whole Law of God, teaching all Duties of Love and
Obedience, is after a more excellent and powerful manner, writ in the hearts of
true Christians and si^cere Believers in Christ Jesus, Jer ^1 33 Heb 8 1^ Ephesians
2 7
than as it is generally writ in the hearts of all Mankind, because the Gospel
Dispensation in the clear Ministration of it, through Faith in Christ Jesus,
has more plenty of Grace, Power and (...) attendin^ it.

That the holy 2 Timothy ^.16. 1 Timothy 4.13, 1^* 1^. 2 Cor 3 6 (...)* 24 4 1 Cor 2 2^
Ephesians. 1.17 18. Psalm. 119.18. 1 John 5 9.10.
Scriptures are given form by di^ine Inspiration, and are profitable and worthy
to be read and meditated upon by the help of the holy Sp^^^t tha^ gave them
forth, and that frequently, for our Instruction, ^a^fication and Comfort, and
Increase of Fait^.

That the true Sense of Scripture is the W^^d o^ God; that they can only be
^avingly understood by the Ill^mination and Revelation of that Spirit that gave
them forth; Rom* 15.4.
That they are useful to Believers, for their growth and increase in Faith and
Holiness, and John 20.31.
to Unbelievers, that they may believe, as God shall be pleased to make them
Instrumental to the same; and that they contain a full and sufficient Testimony
to all Christian Doctrine and Practice; and that the 1 Cor. 2.4, 5. 1 Thessalonians. 1*
5. 1 John 5:9, 10.
Truth of them is believed principally for and because of the inward Testimony,
Evidence and Word of God, and of the holy Spirit, sealing to the Truth of them
in our hearts; and that they are the only outward Test, Touchstone and Ru^e,
whereby to try all Doctrines o^ men, Acts 17.11 cap. 26.22.
so that whatever Doctrine is not according to the holy Scripture, in matters
of Faith and Life, is to be rejected and denied.

SECT. VII. Concerning the Future States of Men after Death, the Day of
Judgment, and Resurrection of the Dead.
WE believe, That after Heb 9, 27 Luk 16, 22, Phi 1, 23. Rev 6, 1^, 11* and
14.13.
Death comes Judgment, and that the Souls of all true ^elievers in Christ
Jesus, both Males and Females, immediately after Death go to God, and to
Christ, in Heaven; and that the Souls of them who dye in final Impeni^ency are
ca^^ into Psalm 9.17, Rev 2*1^
Hell.

That there is a General Day Jude 6. 2 Pet 2.4* Mat 7.22* cap 25, 31, 2 These
1.7* 8, 9, ^0* Acts 17.31 Rom 14 10 2 Cor 10
of Judgment yet to come, wherein all Nations shall stand before the Son of
Man, even the Man christ Jesus, at his Appearance and Coming without us, as
well as at his Appearance and ^udgment Seat within us, to receive according to
the Deeds done in the ^ody, good or evil.

That Christ is the Savior of the whole Man, both Soul and Body* and that
there shall be a Resurrection o^ the Phil 3 21 mat 1* 28, 1 Co^ 6 13, 14 cap 15
2^, 21, 22, 42, 43, 44,
Body, both o^ the Just and Unjust, the just unto Everlasting Life, and the
Unjust unto Shame and Torment forever; And that the Mat 22* 30, Acts 26* 23, 1
Cor 15* 2^, 50.
Resurrection of the Body is not received in this mo^tal Life, nor immediately
after Death, but the deceased Saints generally wait for it, until the Coming of
Christ; and that the dead in Christ shall rise first, when the Body that is
sown natural shall be raised spiritual; for Flesh and Blood does not inherit
the Kingdom of God, no^ Corruption (...).

SECT. VIII. Concerning Christ's Baptism and Supper.
WE believe, That Christ's Mat. ^* 11.
Baptism is with the holy Ghost and Fi^e, whereof the outward Baptism with
Water was a Figure, the which Fire burns up the Dross and Combustible matter
of the Sins and Lusts that war against the Soul, and is that Isa 4.4.
Spirit of Judgment and of Burning, by which the Filth of the Daughters of Zion
is to be purged away.

That Christ^ John 6* 53* 54, 55, 56. 1 Cor. 10* 16.17. Rev 3.20. 1 Cor 11.24,
25, 26.
Supper is his feeding all the faithful, with giving them his flesh to eat, and
his Blood to drink, and such have eternal Life in them, and they daily remember
and meditate on the Lords Death, by the help of his Spirit in them, until his
Last Coming in the Clouds of Heaven, without them, as well as until his more
abundant Revelation in them, and that it is their Duty, as well as great
spiritual advantage, to remember him most frequently, wi^h Prayer and
Thanksgiving, both when they eat not, and when they eat, wh^^her more
p^ivately or more solemnly, as occasion offers.

SECT. IX. Concerning Places and Times of Worship.
WE believe, That all John 4 21 22 23. 1 Timothy 2 8. Col ^.16.
Places and Times of Worship, in themselves considered, are alike under the
Gospel for the Worship of God, and no Place or Time is more Holy than another,
yet convenient Places and Times of Worship, with other necessary Circumstances,
are to be regarded; and the First Day of the Week is worthily set apart from
Bodily Labor, for ( b) Religious Duties and Exercises, both in public and
private, as well as other convenient Times on Week Days, and for meeting
together to wait upon God both in Silence, and in the performance of any
outwa^d Exercise of Religion, that this Spirit moves unto.

SECT X. Concerning some other Necessary Things.
WE believe, that Plai^ Col 4.6. 1 Pet 3 3.4, 5.
Language and Plain Habit, with all manner of Temperance and Abstinence from
all va^n Custom o^ the World, after the manner of the primitiv^ Christians, Tit
2.2, ^^ Rom 12 2*
and according to the Testimony of our Ancient brethren, is to be preserved
among us, and whatever is of good Report.

That all due care is to be taken concerning Marriages, that Persons concerned
may proceed orderly, are that none marry within these Exodus 20.^9* 1 Cor. 5*1.
degrees of Kindred, forbidden under the Law, which are also forbidden under
the Gospel.

SECT. XI. Concerning the Church, and the Qualifications of the true Members
thereof.
WE believe, That the Acts 2 17 Rom 1^.8* 9* 1^. James 2.18* 1 John 4 2* 3. mat
10, 32 33.
Church of Christ is the multitude of sincere Believers in Christ, who ought to
man^fest their Faith to one another by the living Confession of the Month*
flowing from the living Faith in the Heart, accompanied with the Seal and
Confirmation of a Holy and Christian, Li^e and Conversation, which will be
sensibly Gal 2, 9* Prove 14 7 Phil 1 5 2 1 Act^ 8 37 John ^ ^ 1.2.3. Isa 4.5 mat

discerned through a sp^ritual inward Gift o^ Discerning in them as the Tree i^
known by the Fruits, and such have a spiritual Fellowship and Communion
together in the Spirit o^ Christ, and in the Gi^ts, and Graces and Comforts,
and Re^reshments thereof that flow from Christ the Head (...) Fountain, through
Member to Member* And as ^h^ist b^lieved in, is the Doo^ into the Church, in
the light of God (...) Christ, both believed and confess (...) unto, is the
Door into the Church i^ the ^ight of m^n. And that (...) Chur^^ of Christ, the

Over seer, Elders and Ruler^, (...) are known, rec^ived and owned to (...)
such by the 2 Cor. 4.2. cap. 5.11.
Mani^estation (...) same Spirit in all the true Member thereof.

SECT. XII. Concerning Magistracy, and Obedien^^ there-unto.
WE believe, That it is the Du^^ of a^l Christians, to give a ready Obedience
to Magistrates in a lawful things, and to be subject (...) their Commands, not
only for Wra^^ b^t for Rom 13* 2 3. ^ 5. 1 Pet. 2.1^ 14, 15.
Conscience sake; and if they command things unlawful, to make no Resistance by
outward Force, but patiently to suffer under them; for Magistracy and
Government in the World is the Ordinance of God, and when duly performed,
according to Truth and Righteousness am^^g men, belongs to that universal
Ministration of the Spirit, given in general to Mankind, by Virtue of which,
whatever is lawfully commanded by M^gistrates, will be answered by the ^ight of
God, and that just Principle of God in every man's Conscience, that will lead
and instruct him to obey the same.

Given forth by the despised Christian People, called Quakers, from our Yearly
Meeting at Burlington, falsely called the separate Meeting, the 7th o^ the 7th
Mon. 1692. and earnestly Recommended to be read and perused by all Masters of
Families, and by their Children.
Note. That this 2d Edition has the Scripture places more truly printed, with
the addition of diverse others not in the former.
THE END.
