To the MERCHANTS COMMITTEE, the DRY GOODS MERCHANTS, etc.
MY FRIENDS,
IF the Intention of your frequent Meetings is rightly comprehended, it refers
to the Amendment of an Agreement which had been too precipitately entered into,
and not to the Dissolution as some vaguely imagine; I would therefore wish to
recommend one Matter to your Notice at these Meetings, which a Forgetfulness of
at present, may, in Time, lay you under the troublesome Necessity of amending
your new Engagement. -- The Matter is, a serious Consideration of the
Manufactures now carrying on in this Province, and the Propriety of objecting
to such Articles as can be fabricated amongst yourselves in any proportionate
Equality, both in Cheapness and Goodness, to the European or East-Indian; you
will thereby attract the Attention of British Adventurers, and hold out an
alluring Enticement to able Mechanics and Artificers to settle amongst you. --
True Patriotism is not to be found in Clamor, but in Actions that will bear
the Test of Examination; I do not propose however to dictate, but submissively
to hint at an apparent Advantage now offering to America in general through the
Medium of your prudent Resolves.

I am your sincere Friend, An AMERICAN.
PHILADELPHIA, May 12, 1770.
