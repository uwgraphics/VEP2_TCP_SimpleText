To the Inhabitants within the Diocese of Bath and Wells, THOMAS their unworthy
Bishop, wishes the Knowledge, and the Love of GOD.
Dearly Beloved in our Lord,
T HE Church has provided this short Catechism, or Instruction to be learned of
every person, before he be brought to be Confirmed by the Bishop, wherein she
teaches all things that a Christian ought to know and believe for his soul's
health; and she has enjoined All Fathers and Mothers, Masters and Dames to
cause their Children, See the Rubric after (...) Catechism.
and Servants, and Prentices, to come to the Church at the time appointed, and
obediently to hear, and be ordered by the Curate, until such time as they have
learned all that is here appointed to be learned.

How seasonable and necessary this Injunction is in these days, our woeful
experience does sufficiently convince us, when we reflect on the grass
Ignorance and Irreligion of persons in those places where Catechizing is
neglected, which all sober Christians do sadly deplore.

Since then the Providence of God, who is wont to glorify His strength in the
weakness of the Instruments He uses, has (...) from among the meanest Herdsmen
Amos. ^. ^^.
into the pastoral Throne, and has been pleased to commit you to my care; the
love I ought to pay to the chief Shepherd, Joh. 21. 15, 16.
obliges me to feed all His lambs and His sheep that belong to my stock, and
according to my poor abilities, to teach them the Knowledge and the Love of
God; and how they may make them both their daily study and practice.

One thing only I most earnestly beg of you all, whether old or young, that you
would help me to save your own souls; that ye would learn, and seriously
consider, again and again, the terms on which your Salvation is to be had.

As for you who have Families, I beseech you to instill into your Children and
Servants their Duty, both by your Teaching and your Example: In good earnest,
it is less cruel unnatural to deny them bread for their mortal bodies, than
saving knowledge for their Immortal souls.

Ye that are Fathers or Masters, I exhort you to tread in the steps of Abraham,
the Father of the faithful, and the Friend Jam. 2. 23.
of God, and like him, to command Genesis 18. 19.
your Children and House-holds to keep the way of the Lord.

Ye that are Mothers, or Mistresses, I exhort you to imitate that unfeigned
Faith 2. Tim. 1. 5.
which dwelt in young Timothy' s Grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice, who
taught him from a Child (...) 3. 15.
to know the holy Scriptures, which were able to make him wise to Salvation;
and like them to bring up their children and servants in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord Ephesians. 6. ^.


I passionately exhort and beseech you all, of either Sex, never to cease your
conscientious zeal for their instruction, till you bring them to Confirmation;
to renew their Baptismal vow; to make open profession of their Christianity; to
discharge their Godfathers and Godmothers; to receive the solemn Benediction of
the Bishop; to share in the public Intercessions of the Church; and to partake
of all the Graces of God's Holy Spirit, implored on their behalf; that God who
has begun Phil. 1. 6.
a good work in them; may perfect it till the day of Christ: and that I my self
at that dreadful Day, may render Heb. 13. 17.
an account of you with joy.

How much the Catechism of our Church may conduce to so desirable an end, you
will in some measure judge by the following Explication, as imperfect as it is,
and which, by God's gracious Assistance, I have so contrived, that at one and
the same time, it may both inform your Understanding, and raise your
Affections; and that it might the better suit with every ones Leisure and
Infirmities, it is Penned in short Forms of Devotion; to be used in whole, or
in part, in separate Collects or Ejaculations, or occasionally, as your
spiritual necessities shall require.

God of His infinite mercy bless the whole, to His own Glory, and to your
Edification, through JESUS the Beloved.
Amen, Amen.
AN EXPOSITION ON THE CHURCH-CATECHISM, etc.
Question. WHAT is your Name?

Answer. N. or M.

Q. Why do you answer by that Name rather than by your Surname?

A. Because it is my Christian* Name, and was given me when I was made a
Christian, and puts me in mind both of the Happiness and Duty of a Christian.

Q. The Happiness of (...) Christian.
Where do you learn the Happiness and the Duty of a Christian?

A. The very next Answer teaches me the Happiness,, and all the rest of the
Catechism, the Duty of a Christian.

Q. Who gave you this Name?

A. My Godfathers and my Godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a member
of Christ, a child of God, and an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Q. Show me from hence the Happiness of a Christian.

A. The Happiness of a good Christian, is altogether unutterable; he is one who
has Christ for his Head, God for his Father, and Heaven with all its joys and
glories, which are all eternal, for his Inheritance.

Q. Show me, on the Contrary, the condition of a bad Christian.

A. The misery of a bad Christian is altogether insupportable; he has Christ
for his Enemy, the Devil for his Father, and Hell (with all its miseries, and
torments, and despair, which are all eternal) for his Doom.

Q. The Christian's Choice.
Which of these conditions do you choose?

A. I adore the goodness of God, who has set before me Deuteronomy. 30, 19.
life and death, blessing and cursing; and in great compassion to my soul, has
bid me choose life; and with all my heart I choose life, even life eternal.

Q. Are there not many in the world that choose Death?

A. It is too too visible there are: Such is the extreme madness and folly of
obstinate Sinners, that they choose the service of the Devil before the Service
of GOD, and Hell before Heaven: the Damnation of such men is holly from
themselves E^^k. 23. 11.
, and having chosen death, even death eternal it is most just with God to give
them their choice.

Q. Hos. 13. 9.
Blessed be God who has given you grace to make a right Choice: Tell me what
you must do to obtain that which you have chosen, Life eternal?

A. His Duty is Love.
All that I am to do is reduced to one word only, and that is Love; This is the
first and the great Command which comprehends all others, the proper
Evangelical Grace; and eternal Truth has assured me Luke 10. 27, 28.
, This do, and tho^ shall live,; So that if I truly love God, I shall live
beloved by God to all Eternity.

Q. The nature of Love.
Tell me wherein the Love of God does Consist.

A. The Love of God is a Grace rather to be felt than desin'd, so that I can do
no more than rudely describe it: It is the general Inclination and Tendency of
the whole man, of all his heart, and soul, and strength; of all his powers and
affections, and of the utmost strength of them all to GOD, as his Chief, and
only and perfect, and infinite Good.

Q. Is this Love of God taught in the Catechism?

A. The Catechism having in the entrance of it presented to our Choice the
Happiness of a Chrstian, does throughout all the remaining parts of it instruct
us in the Duties of a Christian, by which that Happiness is to be attained,
which are all summed up in the Love of God, which is here most methodically
taught. The method of Love.


Q. In what method does the Catechism teach the Love of God?

A. In a method so excellent and natural, that if by God's help, I can but
faithfully observe it, I shall not fail of the Love of God.

Q. Explain this method to me.

A. It teaches me how the Love of God is produced, how practiced, and how
preserved.

Q. Show me more distinctly in what part of the Catechism each of these
particulars is cought.

A. If I (...) desire the Love of God, I must first (...) all contrary Loves
out of my heart, and then consider the motives and causes that excite it, the
former is taught in the Vow of Baptism, the latter in the Creed.

When divine Love is once produced, my next care is to put it in practice, and
that is by bringing forth the fruits, or effects of Love, which are all
contained in the Ten Commandments.

When the Love of God is produced in my heart, and is set on work, my last
concern is to preserve, and ensure, and quicken it: It is preserved by Prayer,
the pattern of which is the Lord's Prayer: It is ensured to us by the
Sacraments which are the Pledges of Love; and more particularly it is quickened
by the Holy Eucharist, which is the Feast of Love: So that the plain order of
the Catechism teaches me the rise, the progress, and the perfection of Divine
Love, which God of His great mercy give me Grace to follow!

Q. I Beseech God to give you the Grace you pray for, that you may prosecute
this method with your he (...), as well as with your words.

A. It is the full purpose of my Soul so to do, and I trust in God I shall do
it.

Q. You are to begin with the Vow you made at your Baptism: Tell me,

What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you?

A. They did promise and vow three things in my name:

First, That I should renounce the Devil and all his works, Expulsion of
contrary Loves in our Baptismal Vow.
the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the
flesh.

Secondly, That I should believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith.

And Thirdly, That I should keep God's holy Will and Commandments, and walk in
the same all the days of my Life.

Q. Do thou not think thou art bound to believe and do as they have promised
for thee?

A. Yes verily, and by God's help, so I will, and I heartily thank our heavenly
Father, that He has called me to this state of Salvation, through Jesus Christ
our Savior. And I pray unto God to give me His Grace, that I may continue in
the same unto my lives end.

Q. The Promises of Faith and Obedience, which you made in your Baptism, will
be mentioned in their proper places, when you come to the Creed, and to the
Decalogue: that which now lies before you is, to show how your Abre^unciation
is preparatory to the Love of God.

A. As all particular Graces are but the Love of God, varied by different
instances and relations, so all particular S^ns are nothing but Concu(...), or
the love of some one creature or another, in competition (...), or opposition
to the Love of God: Now all the Creatures on which we set our Love, are
reducible to these three, the Devil, the World, and the Flesh; and my heart
must be emptied of these impure Loves; before it is capable of Entertaining the
pure Love of God.

Q. If you are conscious to your self, that you have entertained these impute
Loves, and have violated your Baptismal Vow, and have in your heart renounced
GOD, instead of renouncing His Enemies, what must you do to recover that Favor
of God you have lost, and to be delivered from the wrath to come*

A. I must through^ re^ent of all the breaches of my Vow, Repentance (...) Vow
(...).
and I (...) renew it.

Q. Express your Repentance for breaking it.

A. I express it thus:

O Lord God, with shame, and sorrow, and confusion of Face, I confess and
acknowledge, thy Infinite mercy and Goodness to me, my infinite vileness and
Ingratitude to Thee.

Thou Lord, infinitely good and gracious want pleased out of thine own free
mercy, first to love me, to excite me to love again, Glory ^e to thee.

Thou Lord did vouchsafe, of a miserable sinner, to make me a member of my
Savior, Thy own Child, and an Heir of Heaven; Glory be to Thee!

I infinitely wicked and unworthy, have despised and rejected and forfeited all
the inestimable blessings, to which I was Entitled by my Baptism; Lord have
mercy upon me!

Woe is me, wretch that I am, I have cut my self off by my Sins, from being a
true Member of Christ's mystical Body, and from all the gracious Influences I
might have derived from my Union to Him; Lord have mercy upon me!

Woe is me, wretch that I am, I have by my numerous provocations, lost that
holy Spirit of Adoption, whereby I might become Thy Child, O God, and call Thee
Father, and am become a child of wrath; Lord have mercy upon me.

Woe is me, wretch that I am, I have by my own willful impiety, disclaimed my
being an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven, and am become an Heir to the
Kingdom of Darkness; Lord have mercy upon me!

Woe is me, I have easily yielded to the Temptations of Satan, and have wrought
the Works of my father the Devil; Lord have mercy upon me!

Woe is me, I have greedily coveted and pursued the Pomps and vanity of this
wicked world; Lord have mercy upon me!

Woe is me, I have often Indulged the sinful Lusts of the Flesh; Lord have
mercy upon me.

Woe is me, I have loved all things which Thou Lord, hate, and am my self
become odious in Thy Sight; LORD have mercy upon me.

Woe is me, I have neither believed in Thee, O my God, nor obeyed Thee, nor
loved Thee, as I ought, and as I solemnly vowed I would; Lord have mercy upon
me.

O Lord God, most gracious and reconcilable, Pity and pardon me.

I lament, O Lord God, my detestable impiety, for having so long, and so often,
and so obstinately offended Thee.

In the bitterness of my soul, O Father of mercy, I bewail and abhor my
unworthiness, and the hardness of my Heart, that has despised the Romans 2. 4.
riches of thy Goodness, and Forbearance, and Long-suffering, which should have
lead me to Repentance.

O Lord God, whatever Thou deniest me, deny me not a broken Psalm. 51. 17.
and a (...) heart.

O that my head were Jer. 9. 1.
waters, and my eyes fountains of tears! that I might weep much, and love Luc.
7. 47.
much, having much to be (...).

Lord, hear me, help me, save me* for Thy own gracious promise sake, for Thy
own tender mercies sake, for the Merits and Sufferings of Jesus Thy beloved, in
whom Thou have made Penitents accepted. Amen, Amen.

Q. Having repented of the violations of your Baptismal Vow, show me how you
will renew it.

A. Our Vow renewed.
I shall do it after this manner.

I have (...), O Lord God, I have sinned, and done evil in Thy sight, but I
repent, I turn to Thee.

I confess Ps. 38. 18.
, and forsake my wickedness, and am sorry for my sins.

It greives me, O most amiable Goodness, it grieves me that ever I offended
Thee.

With all my heart, O my God, do I now renew the Sacred Vow, which, alas! alas!
I have so often violated.

O Lord God, I do, for the future, Renounce the Devil, that Arch-rebel against
Thee; with all his apostate-Angels.

I Renounce all his Worship 1. Cor. 10. 20. Ephesians 2. 2, 12
, all his impious Suggestions Joh. 13 2.
, Delusions 2 Cor. 4. 4.
and Temptations, for which he is called the Tempter Mat. 4. 3.
, and all the ways of consulting him, which ungodly men have taken Act. 19. 19.
.

I Renounce all his works, all those sins of the spirit, all Pride 1. Tim. ^. 6.
, and Joh. 8. 44.
Malice, and Envy; all Treachery -- 6. 70.
and Lying, Revenge and Cruelty; all Tempting others to sin, Hatred to Holiness
Act. 13. 10.
, and Apostasy Jude. 6.
, which are his daily practice, and are truly Diabolical.

I utterly Renounce, O Lord God, the pomps and vanity of this wicked world; all
covetous desires of Honor, Riches, Pleasure Tit. 2. 12.
, all sinful excesses in things lawful 1. Cor. 7. 30. 31.
.

I Renounce, Lord, all evil Romans 12. 2.
Customs, all evil Companions, (...). 1. 10. 1. Cor 15. 33
, all that is vain or wicked Joh. 17. 15. 1. J^^ 5. 19.
in the world, all that friendship with the world, which (...) enmity Jam. 4. 4.
with Thee; all things that may alienate my heart from Thee.

I Renounce O Lord God, all worldly comforts and possessions; all my natural
Relations, and my own Life lak. 14. 26.
, whenever they stand in competition with my Duty to Thee.

I utterly Renounce, O Lord God, all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh; all the
inordinate desires of my own corrupt nature, of my own carnal mind, Romans 7. 18.
25. -- 8. 7.
which is enmity with Thee.

I renounce, Lord, all fleshly lusts which war agints 1. Pet. 2. 11.
Thee, and against my own soul, all Sloth and Idleness, and Intemperance, and
Lasciviousness, all filthiness of flesh 2. Cor. 7. 1.

O Lord God. 1 John 2. 15.
I utterly renounce all things that may any way displease Thee; Gal. 5. 19.
from them all let it be Thy good pleasure to deliver me.

I know, Lord, that Sin is the utmost Pro. 15. 9.
abomination to Thy Purity, the most audacious outrage to Thy adorable Majesty,
the perfect Contradiction to Thy Deity, and therefore I ulterly renounce and
abhor it.

I know Lord, that Sin exposes us to all the vials of Thy Wrath, and to
vengeance eternal; I know it sets the Sinner at the extremest Distance, and
Opposition, and Defiance to Thee, and therefore I utterly renounce and abhor it.

I know, Lord, I cannot love Thee Psalm. 97. 10.
but I must hate Evil, and therefore I Renounce and detest it.

Turn Thou me Jer. 31. 18.
, O Lord God, and so shall I be turned.

Turn, O Lord the whole stream of my Affections, from sensual love, to the love
of Thee.

O my God, let Thy heavenly love be the constant Bias of my Soul; O (...) it
^e the natural Spring and Weight of my Heart, that it may alwa^es move toward
Thee!

Thy Love, O my God shall hereafter be the sole Rule and Guide of my life; I
will love Thee, and love whatever Thou love, and hate whatever Thou hate: I
will believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith, and I will keep Thy holy
Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my Life.

All this, O my God, I own my self bound to believe and do, and though of my
self I am impotent to all Good 2 Cor. 3. 4. Joh. 15.5.
, yet by Thy Help Phil. 4. 13.
I will perform it; and I heartily thank Thee, O Heavenly Father 1. Ephesians. 3. 1.
Pet. 1. 3.
, who out of mere Compassion to my soul, have called me to this state of
Salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Glory be to Thee, O Lord, who have indulged me this opportunity of Repentance;
Glory be to Thee who nast wrought in me this Will, to renew my Baptismal Vow.

O my God, I humbly, I earnestly pray unto Thee to give me continual Supplies
of Thy Grace, that I may continue in Thy love unto my (...) End: That being
faithful to Death, I may receive the Crown of Life Rev. 2. 10.


O Lord God, I have sworn Ps. 119. 106.

devoted to Thee: Enter, O my God; possess it with Thy gracious presence, and
fill it with Thy love.

and Privileges of my Baptism, of which I have been spoiled by my Sins.

Lord, make me a living Member of Thy Church, the mystical Body of thy Son 1.

Ephesians. 4. 15 2. Col. 19.
Father, I have (...) against Heaven, and in Thy sight, and am no more worthy
to be called Thy son: but I return with the Prodigal Luke 15. 18.
. O let Thy paternal bowels yern on me, and graciously receive me.

Lord send Thy Spirit of Adoption Gal. 3. 26, 27.

Thee for Thy Child, and call Thee Father, and share in the Blessings of thy
Children, and at last become an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven. Romans 8.
16, 17.


O Heavenly Father, accept my imperfect Repentance, compassionate my
Infirmities, forgive my wickedness, purify my uncleanness, strengthen my

Thee.

The longer I live O my God, the more reason I have to love Thee, because every
day supplies me with flesh Experiments, and new Motives of Thy man (...) love
to me; and therefore, All love, all glory be to Thee.

And (...) JESUS.
I believe in Thee, O JESUS, and I rejoice rejoice in that Dear Name which is
so full and expressive of Thy Love. The Second Person in the Trinity,


Thou art JESUS our Savior, because Thou came into the world on purpose to
save us from our mat. 1. 21.

O be Thou ever JESUS to me; God the Son. His* Offices.
O let me feel the kind force of that sweet Name, in which I and all sinners do
read our Danger, and our Deliverance, our guilt, and our Salvation.

O most benign JESU! He well deserves to be accursed, that does not love Thee
1. Cor. 16. 22.
: Who, Lord, can ever hope to share in Thy Salvation, that does not love Thee
his Savior?

CHRIST.
I Believe, O merciful Jesus, that Thou art Christ the true Messiah Joh. 1. 41.

sweet Ointment on thy Soul without Joh. 3. 34.

I believe, O Thou Anointed of God, that as Kings 1. Sam. 15. 1.

, and Prophets 1. King. 19. 16.
, were heretosore anointed with material oil; so by Thy Heavenly Anointing Mat.

Thou want Consecrated to be our Prophet, our King, and our Priest, and in all

.

Our Redemption, our illumination, our support is wholly from Thy Love, O Thou
Anointed of God: All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

His only SON.
I believe that Thou, O most adorable JESUS, art the Son of GOD, His two
natures.
by ineffable Generation Heb. 1. 5. Isa. 53 8. Joh. 1. 1.
, Thou did from Eternity derive Thy Godhead from the Father; 1. of God. His
Eternal Generation.
Thou art the brightness Heb. 1. 3.
of His Glory, and the express Image of His Person: All love, all glory be to
Thee.

Thou, O Blessed Jesu, art the onlySon of God, the only begotten Son, full of
grace and truth Joh. 1. 14. 18. 5. 18. Romans 8. 32. Mat. 3. 17.
;Thou art the only beloved Son in whom Thy Father is well pleased; it is only in
Thee, and for Thee, that sinners have Hope; and therefore, All Love, all Glory
be to Thee.

Thou art equal Phil. 2. 6.
to the Father, O Jesu, in Amiableness and in Love to us, and art equally to
beloved by us; and therefore All love and praise be to the Father that
eternally begat Joh. 5. ^.
, and to the Son eternally begotten.

Our LORD.
I believe, His Deity.
O Thou eternal Son of the Father, that Thou art the Great Tit. 2. 13
and true 1. Joh. 5. 20
GOD, Jehovah our Righteousness Jer. 23. 6.
God above all, blessed for ever Romans 9. 5.
, and mighty to save Isai. 63. ^.
: All love, all glory be to Thee.

I believe, O Lord Jesus, that Thou did make Joh. 1. 3.
and do sustain all things by thy power Heb. 1. 3, 10.
, and that thou art to be honored by men and by Angels, as thy Father is
honored Joh. 5. 23.
: All love, all glory be to thee.

I believe, O thou King of Kings, and LORD of Lords Rev. 19. 16.
, that thou art the Lord and the Author of the New Creation Ephesians. 1. 21. 22. 2.
10.
, as well as of the old, that thou art more peculiarly Lord of us Sinners by
purchase 1. Cor. 6. 20
: O that I, and all that own thy Dominion, may forever love, and revere, and
obey Luc. 6. 46.
so powerful and gracious a Lord!

Who was Conceived by the Holy Ghost.
I Believe O most condescending Majesty, 2. of Man in his state of Humillation.
that when thou did stoop so low as to assume our frail nature, the Holy
Ghost came on thy sacred Mother, and that the power of the Highest did
overshadow her Luc. 1. 31 24, 35, 42.
, His Conception.
and that she did conceive, and lodge thee in her Womb, where thou, who sillest
Heaven and Earth, were about nine months for our sakes imprisoned; and
therefore All love, all glory be to thee.

Born of the Virgin Mary.
I Believe, O most Adorable Humility, that thou wast at last born into the
world Luc. 2. 6, 7.
, that thou having only God for thy Father, and Mary, a pure Virgin for thy
Mother, whom all generations do call blessed Luc. 1. 48.
, both thy Conception and Birth were perfectly immaculate, that being without
Sin thy Self 1. Joh. 2. 1, 2,
, thou might be a sit Sacrifice to atone for us sinners, who being born of
unclean parents, were all by nature unclean Joh. 14. 4.
and therefore All love, all glory be to thee, O immaculate Lamb of GOD, who
take away the sins of the world. Joh. 1. 29.


I believe, O Blessed Savior, that the two Natures of GOD, and of Man, were in
thee so mysteriously united, without either Change, or Confusion, that they
made in thee but One Person, but one Mediator 1. Tim 2. 5.
, one Lord Ephesians. 4. 5.
, Thou, O Eternal Word, did become Flesh, and did dwell among us Joh. 1. 14.
on purpose to save us; and therefore All love, all glory be to thee.

Suffered.
I believe, O Adorable Love, that thy whole Life was made up of Sufferings, and
that for sinful men, and in particular for me; O let me never cease to adore
and love thee.

It was for us sinners, O tenderest Love, that in thy very Infancy, thou wast
Circumcised Luc. 2. 21.
and designed by Herod for slaughter, and fore't to flee into Egypt Mat. 2. 13.
16.
, and therefore I praise and love thee.

It was for us Sinners, that Thou, O Afflicted Love. were all thy life long, a
man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief Isa. 53. 3.
; that thou wast persecuted and reviled, despised, and rejected, and had not
where to lay thy Head Mat. 8. 20.
: and therefore I am bound to praise, and to love thee.

It was for us Sinners, that Thou, O Compassionate Love, when thou tookest on
thee our nature, wast touched with a feeling of our infirmities, and wast in all
points tempted; like as we are, yet without sin Heb. 4. 15.
that thou might the more affectionately pity the weak, and succor the
tempted; and therefore I praise and love thee.

It was for us sinners, that Thou, O beneficent Love, did go about doing good
Act. 10. 38.
, preaching Repentance, publishing the glad Tidings of Salvation Mat. 4. 17
Luc. 4. 18.
, sending thy Disciples Mat 10. 1, 5.
, confirming thy Heavenly Doctrine by many glorious Miracles 11. 5.
, and illustrating it by a God-like example; all thy Life is full of
Attractives of sweetest Love and Pity to us Sinners, which kindly 2. Cor. 5. 14.
and forcibly constrain us to praise and love Thee.

O most exuberant Love, how amiable are all thy Graces! O sill my heart with
Thy Love, and transform me into thy likeness Romans 8. 29.
, that I may all my life long imitate thy perfect Obedience, unspotted
Holiness, unchangeable Resolution, universal Charity, uninterrupted Devotion,
Contempt of the world, Heavenly-mindedness, Gracious Condescension, ardent Zeal
for thy Father's Glory, and unbounded Love; and that for the sake of that
dearest Love, which inclined Thee to become incarnate for me.

I blieve, His Sufferings previous to His crucifixion.
O my Lord, and my God, that tho. Thou did suffer all thy Life long, yet Thy
greatest Sufferings were under the Roman Governor of Judge, Pantius Pilate; I
believe all those mighty Sufferings, but am as little able to express the
greatness of them, as I am the greatness of thy Love which moved Thee to
suffer: All I can do is to Love, and to praise Thee.

How great were Thy Sufferings, O Savior of the World, when the very
apprehension of them, made thy soul very heavy, exceeding sorrowful even, to
Death, made thee offer up Prayers, with strong crying and Tears, that if it
were thy Father's Will the cup might pass from thee, threw thee into an-Ag^ny
and bloody Sweat, Heb. 5. 9. Mat. 26. 38. Luc. 22.43,44
insomuch that there was an Angel sent from Heaven on purpose to strengthen
thee! 'O' Thou agonizing Love, impress on my heart so tender a sense of Thy
sufferings for me, that I may agonise with Thee, that I may feel all thy
Sorrows, that though I cannot sweat blood like Thee, I may disolve into Tears
for Thee, that I may love and suffer with Thee throughout every part of thy
Passion.

O Suffering JESUS, when my Meditations follow thee from the Garden to Mount
Calvary, I grieve and I love all the way.

I grieve, and I love, when I see Thee, O, incarnate God, who could command
more than twelve Legions of Angels for thy Rescue; out of Love to Sinners, and
in particular to me, one of the vilest of all that number, humbling thy Self to
be Apprehended and bound by the rude soldiers, as a (...)factour Mat.26. 47.
53. 57. Joh. 18. 4.
.

I grieve, and I love, when I see thee, O gracious Lord, for my sake, betrayed
by the treacherous Kiss of Judas, Mat. 26. 49. 51. 70.
denied by peter, and forsaken of all thy Disciples.

I grieve and I love, when I see Thee, O spotless Innocence, out of love to me,
dragged to Annas, Job. 18. 12.
and Caiaphas Mat. 26. 57, 59. Luc. 22. 66
the High Priest, when I see thee accused by false witnesses, Arraigned and
Condemned.

I grieve and I love, when I see Thee, OF Divine Majesty, out of Love, to me,
spit upon, and blind-folded, and buffeted, and mocked, Mat. 26, 67. Luc. 22. 63
sent to Pilate, an Insidel Judge Mat. 27. 2.
then to wicked Herod Luke 23. 6, 11, 12.
who with his men of War set Thee at naught, arrayed thee in a white Robe of
Mockery, and sent thee again to Pilate.

I grieve, and I love, O injured Goodness, when I see Thee, though declared
innocent by the very Traitor Judas, who out of horror for his Crime, went and
hanged himself; though declared innocent by Pilate himself, the Judge to whom
thine enemies appealed, yet worried to death by the Clamours of the Rabble,
that cried out Crucifie' Crucify; when I see Barabbas a traitor, and a
Murderer preferred before Thee Luc. 23. 14. 18. 19. 21. Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5.


I grieve, and I love when I see Thee, O Lover of souls: for my sake most
unjustly given-up, into the hands of insidel Soldiers, to be stripped naked, and
tied to a Pillar, and scourged; Job. 19. 1. Psalm. 129. 3
to see the (...) plowing on thy back, and making long sorrows.

I grieve and I love, O KING of Heaven, when I see Thee, out of Love to me,
humbling thy Self to be arrayed in (...) Mat. 2^. 28. 29.
with a Read in thy hand; when I see Thee Crowned with Thorns, to multiply thy
Torments; when I see thee mocked by barbarous wretches, with their bended Knee,
and with Hail King of the Jews.

I grieve, and I love, when I see Thee, O LORD GOD, whom the Angels worship,
spit upon again, and buffeted Marc.15. 19.
, and for my sake, made the extreme Scorn, and Contempt, and Sport of thy
insolent and insulting Enemies; and though still declared innocent by Pilate
Mat.27. 24. 26.
, yet surrendered to the unrelenting Cruelty of the Multitude, to be Crucified.

My Lord, my God, my Savior, with all my heart, I love, and adore Thy infinite
Love and Benignity to Sinners; with all my heart, I lament and detest the
hatred, and outrage of sinners to thee.

Was Crucified
I grieve, and I love, O sorrowful JESUS, when I see Thee, His Crucifixion
for my sake, oppressed with the weight of thy own Cross Job. 17.
, till thy tender Body, quite spent with sufferings, sank under it Mat. 27. 32.
,

I grieve, and I love, O Thou great Martyr of Love, when for my sake I see thy
Virgin Body stripped naked, thy Hands and thy Feet nailed to the Cross; when I
see Thee crucified between two Thioves -- 27. 38.
, and numbered with the transgrissours, when I see Gall given thee to eat, and
(...) to drink Psalm. 69. 21.


I grieve, and I love, when I see Thee, O incarnate Deity, hanging on the
Cross, and for my sake, by thy own people, in the height of thy Anguish,
derided, reproacht and blasphemed, with Wagging of their hands, mocked by the
Soldiers, and by the impenitent Thief Mat. 27. 39.
,

I grieve, and I love, when I see Thee, O God Blessed for evermore, O Fountain
of all Blessing, hang bleeding on the Cross, and made a curse for me Gal. 3.
13.
; How does my indignation swell against the Injustice and ingratitude, and
Inhumanity of the Jews, who could thus cruelly treat so unreproachable an
Innocence, so amiable a Charity, so compassionate a Savior.

Alas, alas, It was the Sinner, O Love incarnate, rather than the Jew, that
betrayed, and derided, and blasphemed, and tortured and crucified Thee; the
Sins of lapsed mankind Isa. 53. 6.
, and particularly my Sins, they were Thy Tormentors; and therefore from my
heart, I bewail, detest and abjure them.

My Lord, and my God, instill penitential Love into my soul, that I may grieve
for my sins, which grieved Thee, that I may love thee for Suffering for us
sinners, who occasioned all thy griefs; O may I always love thee, O may I never
grieve thee more!

Dead.
I grieve, and I love O bleeding Love, when I see thee on the Cross, His Death.
quite spent with pain and Anguish, when I see thee in thy dying pangs
commending thy Spirit into the Hands of thy Heavenly Father Luc. 23. 46.
bowing thy head Joh. 19. 30.
and giving up the Ghost.

Thou, O Lord of Life, did for us sinners humble thy self to death, even to
the death of the Cross, a death of utmost shame and ignominy, and of Torment
insupportable; all Love, all glory be to Thee.

Was ever any sorrow, O Crucified Lord, like that Sorrow my Sins created Thee?

Was ever any Love, O infinite mercy, like that Love Thou did show, in dying
for Sinners,

All the frame of Nature, O dying Savior, fell into Convulsions at the
Crucifixion of their great Creature; The Sun was Darkened Mat. 27. 51.
the Veil of the Temple was rent from the Top to the Bottom, the earth (...),
the Rocks clave asunder the Bodies of dead Saints rose out of their graves,
insomuch that the Centurion, and Infidel Soldiers acknowledged thee to be the
Son of God; Thou wast lovely, and glorious, and adorable in Thy lowest
Humiliation; all Love, all praise be to Thee.

Thy Bodily Sufferings, O Almighty love, His unknown Sufferings.
were intolerable, but yet Thy inward were far greater.

I grieve, I love, I melt all over, when I hear Thee on the Cross crying out,
My God, my God, why have Thou forsaken me Cap. 27. v. 46.
? Ah sinful wretch that I am, how infinite and unconceiveable were the inward
Dolours and Agonies thou did undergo for us Sinners, when Thou did tread
the Wine Press of thy Father's Wrath alone, Isai. 63. 3.
when it pleased thy own must beloved Father to bruise Thee, and to pint. Thee
to grief, Cap. 53. v. 6, 10.
when the Iniquities of the whole world, were-laid on Thee, and my numerous
sins increas't thy load, and heightened thy Torment, when thy own Deity withdrew
all Consolation from Thee: when GOD, offended by our Sins, did afflict Thee in
the day of His fierce anger Lam.1. 12.
; no Sufferings, no Love was ever like unto Thine for me; no grief, no Love but
thy own should exceed mine for Thee.

For whom, O unutterable Goodness, did thou suffer the Extreme bitterness of
sorrow, but for the vilest of all thy Creatures, sinful Man, and for me one of
the worst of sinners? and therefore I praise and love Thee.

For what end did thou suffer, O most ardent Charity, but to save sinners
from all things that were distructive, the Curse of the Law Gal. 3. 13.
, the Terrors of Death Heb. 21. 14, 15.
, the Tyranny of Sin Rom 6. 14.
the powers of Darkness, and Torments Eternal 1. These. 1. 10.
, to purchase for us all things conducible to our Happiness Ephesians. 1. 7. Heb. 9.
12. 15.
, Pardon and Grace, Consolation and Acceptance, and the everlasting Joys and
Glories of the Kingdom of Heaven; and therefore I praise and love thee.

Out of what motive did Thou suffer, O boundless (...) out of thy own
preventing I. Job. 4. 19.
Love, free Mercy, and pure Compassion; and therefore I praise and love thee.

When no other Sacrifice could atone thy Father's Anger, O thou beloved Son of
God, and reconcile Divine Justice and Mercy together, but the Sacrifice of God
(...) who as man was to die Heb. 9. 28.
, and to suffer in our stead, as God was to merit and (...) satisfaction for
our Sins; 'twas then that (...) O God the Son, did become man, the very
meanest of men, did take upon thee the form of A Servant, Phil. 2. 7.
and did on the Cross show us the (...) and the Miracle of Love, God
Crucified for (...) and Sinners Redeemed by the blood of God Act. 20. 28.


O Thou prop^^ious Wonder, God incarnate on the Cross, by what Names shall I
adore Thee? all are too short too scanty to express Thee, Love only, nothing
but LOVE will reach Thee, Thou art LOVE I. Jon 4. 8.
, O Jesu, Thou art all Love, O tenderest, O sweetest, O purest O dearest Love,
soften sweeten, refine, love me into all Love like thee.

By the Love of thy Cross, O Jesu, I live, Gal. 2. ^0. -- 6. 14.
in that I will only (...), that above all things will I study 1 Cor. 2. 2
that before all things will I value Phil. 3. 8.
; by the love of thy Cross, I will take up my Cross daily Luc. 9. 23.
and follow Thee, I will persecute, and and Torment, and crucify Romans 6. 6.
Gal. 5. 24.
my sinful Affections and Lusts, which persecuted, tormented, and crucified
Thee, and if thy love calls me to it, I will suffer on the Cross for Thee, h
Act.21. 13.
as thou have done for me.

How illustrious and amiable were thy Graces amidst all thy Sufferings, O Thou
afflicted Jesu; I admire, and I love thy profound Humility, unwearied Patience,
Lamb-like Meekness, immaculate Innocence, invincible Courage, absolute
Resignation, Compassionate Love of Souls, and perfect Charity to thy Enemies. O
my Love, I cannot love thee as I ought, but I desire above all things to be
like my beloved; O give me grace to tre^d in thy steps I. Pet. 2. 21.
and conform me to thy Thy Divine Image, that the more I grow like thee, the
more I may love thee, and the more I may be loved by thee.

And Buried, He descended into Hell.
I believe, His B^rial and Descent.
O crucified Lord, that thou wast realy dead, and there was a Separation of thy
Body and Soul: that thy side was mortally wounded, and pierced with a spear on
the Cross Joh.19. 34.
, and thy Sacred Body was buried Mat. 27. 57. 60.
, to assure us of Thy Death. All Love, all Glory be to thee.

I believe, O pierced, O wounded Love, that thy Soul in the state of Separation
did descend into Hell Ephesians. 4. 9.
, to vanquish Death and all the Spirits of Darkness in their own Dominions: and
therefore I adore and Love Thee.

Glory be to thee, O thou great Champion of Love, who did for our sakes
singly encounter all our ghostly Enemies, who did thy self taste of Death
Heb. 2. 9.
, that thou might take away the sting of Death 1. Cor. 15 55. 56. 57.
who did wrestle with Principalities and Powers Col. 2. 15
and all the force of Hell, that we might share in thy Victory; for which
wonderful Salvation I will always praise and love Thee.

The third day He rose again from the Dead.
I believe, His state of Exaltation.
O Almighty Love, that, according to the Types and Prophecies which went before
of thee Luc. 24. 26, 27. Mat 12. 40.
and according to thy own infallible Predictions, His Resurrection.
thou did by thy own power Job. 2. 19.
rise from the Dead the third day: All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

Glory be to thee, who did lie so long in the Grave to undergo the full
Condition of the Dead, and to convince all the world thou were dead; and did
rise so soon that Thou might not see corruption Act.2. 31.
or retard our joy Joh.16. 22.
All Love, all Glory be to thee.

He ascended into Heaven.
I believe, His Ascension.
O victorious Love, that Thou, after thy Conquest over Death and Hell, did
ascend in Triumph to Heaven Luc.24. 51. Act 1. 9, 10
, that thou might prepare Mansions for us Joh.14. 2.
and from thence as Conqueror bestow the Gifts of my Conquest on us Ephesians. 4. 8.
and above all the Gift of thy Holy Spirit Job. 16. 7.
that thou might enter into the Holy of Holies, as our great High Priest Heb.
6. 19. 20. 10. 10, 21.
to present to thy Father the sweet smelling Sacrifice of His Crucified Son,
the sole Propitiation for Sinners; and therefore All Love, all glory be to thee.

Glory be to Thee, O Jesu, who did leave the world and ascend to Heaven about
the Thirty third year of thy age, to teach us in the Prime of our years to
despise this world when we are best able to enjoy it, and to reserve our full
vigor for Heaven and for thy Love.

O Thou whom my soul loves, since Thou ha^h left the world, what was there
ever in it worthy of our Love? O let all my affections ascend after Thee, and
never return to the Earth any more; For, whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and
there (...) none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee Psalm. 73. 25.


And sits at the right hand of GOD, the Father Almighty.

I believe, His Session.
O Triumphan* Love, that Thou now fittest in full and peaceful possession of
Bliss I. Pet. 3. 22.
and at the right Hand of GOD: that thy humane Nature is exalted to the most
honorable place in Heaven, where thou sit on thy Throne of glory, adored
by Angels Rev. 5. 8, 9. 12.
, and interceding for Sinners Romans 8. 34.
and therefore, All Love all Glory be to Thee.

Glory be to thee, O love Enthroned, Thy Resurrection, Ascension and Session,
are all signal instances of Thy love, and earnests of our future Felicity, the
entire purchase of thy Love: All our hopes of Heaven, our Resurrection,
Ascension and Glorification depend on, and are derived from thine, and are all
the Trophies of thy love to us; and therefore I will ever praise and love Thee.

From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the Dead.

I believe, O Glorified Love, that from Thy Throne at God's right Hand, His
coming to Judgment.
where Thou now fittest, Thou will come again Acts. I. 11. Phil 3. 20.
to judge the world, attended with thy holy Angels (...) 1. 7.
All Glory be to Thee.

I believe, O thou adorable Judge, that all mankind shall be summoned before
thy awful Tribunal: All the Dead, who shall then he waked out of their Graves
when the Angel shall blow the last Trump 1. Cor. 15. 52.
and all that are then Quick and alive shall then appear before thee. All Glory
be to Thee.

I believe, Lord, that I and all the World shall give a strict account of all
our thoughts and words and actions; that the Books will then be opened; that
out of those dreadful Registers we shall then be judged Romans 14. 10. Mat. 12.
36. Rev. 20. 12.
that Satan and our own Consciences shall be our Accusers. O let the last Trump
be ever sounding in my ears, that I may ever be mindful of my great Accounts
Eccles. 12. 13. 14.
and that I may neither speak, nor do, nor think anything that may wound my own
Conscience, or provoke Thy Anger, or make me tremble at the awful day.

I know, O Thou adorable Judge, that Love only shall then endure that terrible
Test, that love only shall be acquitted, that Love only shall be eternally
blessed; and therefore I will ever praise and LoveThee.

Glory be to Thee, O Thou O Thou beloved Son of GOD, to whom the Father has
committed all Judgment l Job. 5. 22.


How can they that love Thee, O Jesu, ever despond, though their love in this
life is (...) imperfect, when at last they shall have love for their Judge,
Love that has felt and will compassionate all their infirmities; and therefore
all Love all Glory be to Thee.

I believe in the HOLY GHOST.
I because in Thee. The Third Person in the Trinity.
O Thou Spirit of God, the Third person in the most Adorable Trinity; I
believe, O Blessed Spirit, than Thou art the lord 2. Cor. 3. 17. 18.
, that Thou art GOD Joh. 4. 24. Act. 5. 3.
Eternal Heb. 9. 14.
and Omniscient I. Cor. 2. 10.
a Person distinct from both the Father and the Son, eternally proceeding from
both Mat. 10. 20. Romans 8. 9.
and equally sent by both r Joh. 14. 26. 16. 7.
and joint Author with both of our Salvation: and therefore all love, all glory
be to thee.

I believe, O blessed Spirit, that Thou art Holy, essentially Holy 1. Pet. 1.
15.
in respect of thy own Divine Nature, and being essentially Holy, art
infinitely (...); and therefore all love, all glory be to Thee.

I believe, O blessed Spirit, that Thou art personally Holy, that thou art the
Author of all internal Holiness, and all internal and sanctifying Grace Gal.5.
22.
that Thou art the principle of all Spiritual life in us Joh. 3. 5.
and therefore all Love, all Glory be to Thee.

Glory be to Thee, O Love incarnate, for sending the Spirit in thy stead, and
for promising it to our Prayers Luc. 11. 13.


Glory be to Thee, O Spirit of Love, for shedding the Love of God abroad in our
hearts Romans 5. 5.
for filling all that love Thee with Exuberance of Joy and Consolation; All
Love, all glory be to Thee.

O Thou blessed Spirit the Comforter, purify my Soul, and infuse thy Love into
it, and Consecrate it to be Thy Temple I. Cor. 6. 19.
and fix Thy Throne immoveably there, and set all my Affections on fire, that
my heart may be a continual Sacrifice of Love offered up to thee, and the Flame
may be ever aspiring toward Thee.

united into one Body, of which Thou art the Head Col. 1. 18.

professing the Doctrine taught, by Thee Act. 2. 41. 42. --
, and delivered to the Saints Jude3.
and devoted to praise and love Thee.

I believe, O holy Jesus, that thy Church is Holy like thee its Author; Holy by
the Original Design of its Institution 2 Timothy 1. 9.
, Holy by Baptismel Dedication, Holy in all its Administrations, which tend to
produce Holiness 1 Timothy 2. 19.
and though there will be always a mixture of good and bad in it in this world
Mat.13. 24.
yet that it has always many real Saints in it; and therefore All love, all
glory be to Thee.

I believe, Lord, This Church to be Catholic, or Universal, made up of the
Collection of all particular Churches; I believe it to be Catholic in respect
of lime, comprehending all ages to the Worlds End, to which it is to endure 16.
18. -- 28. 20.
Catholic in respect of all Places, out of which Believers are to be gathered
-- 28. 19.
Catholic in respect of all saving Faith, of which this Creed contains the
substance, which shall in it always be taught Joh. 16. 13.
Catholic in respect of all Graces, which shall in it be practiced, and
Catholic in respect of that Catholic War it is to wage against all its
ghostly Enemies, for which it is called Militatnt: O preserve me always a true
Member of thy Catholic Church, that I may always inseparably adhere to Thee,
that I may always devoutly praise and love Thee.

Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God; who have made me a Member of the particular
Church of ENGLAND, whose Faith, and Government, and Worship are Holy, and
Catholic, and Apostolic, and free from the extremes of Irreverence or
Superstition, and which I firmly believe to be a sound part of thy Church
Universal, and which teaches me Charity to those who dissent from me; and
therefore all Love, all glory be to Thee.

O my GOD, give me grace to continue steadfast in her Bosom, to improve all
those Helps to true piety, all those means of Grace, all those Incentives of
thy Love, thou last mercifully indulged me in her Communion, that I may with
primitive Affections and Fervor praise and Love thee.

The Communion of Saints.
I believe, Communion.
O King of Saints, that among the Saints on Earth, whether real or in outward
Profession only, there ought to be a mutual, Catholic Participation of all
good things I Joh. 1. 7.
I which is the immediate Effect of Catholic Love. Thou, O God of Love,
restore it to Thy Church.

I believe, O thou God of Love, that all the Saints on earth by profession
ought to communicate one with another, in Evangelical Worship, and the same
holy Sacraments, in the same Divine and Apostolical Faith Act.2^. 42. 46.
, in all Offices of Corporal Gal.6. 10.
and Spiritual Charity Romans 12. (...) 9, etc. 1 These. 5. 14. Heb. 10. 25
, in reciprocal delight in each others Salvation, and in tender Sympathy as
Members of one and the same Body 1. Cor.12. 13. 26.
: O God of peace, restore in thy good time this Catholic Communion, that with
one heart and one mouth we may all praise and love thee.

O my God, amidst the Deplorable Divisions of thy Church, 'O let me never widen
its Breaches, but give me Catholic Charity to all that are Baptized in Thy
Name, and Catholic Communion with all Christians in Desire. O deliver me from
the Sins and Errors, from the Schisms and Heresies of the Age. O give me grace
to pray daily for the peace of thy Church Psalm 122. 6.
, and earnestly to seek it, and to excite all I can to praise and to love thee.

I believe, O most Holy Jesu, that thy Saints here below, have Communion with
thy Saints above Heb. 12^. 22.
, that they pray for us, While we celebrate their Memories, congratulate their
Bliss, give thanks for their Labors of Love, and imitate their Examples; for
which all Love all glory be to Thee.

I believe, O gracious Redeemer, that thy Saints here on Earth, have Communion
with the Holy Angels above; that they are ministering (...) Heb. 1. 14
(...) forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of Salvation, and watch
over us Ps.34. 7.
; and we give thanks to Thee for their protection, and emulate their incessant,
praises and ready Obedience; for which All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

I believe, O my Lord and my God, that the Saints in this Life, have Communion
with the Three Persons of the most adorable Trinity 1. Joh. 1. 3. Phil.2. 1.
, in the same most benign Influence of Love in which all Three conspire; for
which, All Love, all glory be to Thee, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, world
without End.

Glory be to Thee, O Goodness infinitely Diffusive, for all the Graces and
Blessings in which the Saints communicate, for breading thy Love, as the very
Soul into thy Mystical Body, that all that believe in thee, may love one
another, and all join in loving Thee.

The Forgiveness of Sins.
I believe, O my God, that none can forgive sins but Thou alone, Marc.2. 7.
, and that in Thy Church Forgiveness is always to be had; Reconciliation with
God.
and for so an inestimable a blessing, all Love, all glory be to thee.

I believe, O thou Lover of Souls, that without true Repentance, we cannot hope
for Pardon 1. Joh. 1. 9.
, that our Repentance is at the best imperfect, that it is out of thy mere
Mercy, O heavenly Father Tit. 3. 4. 5.
, and for the Merits, and Passion of thy Crucified Son 1 Pet.1, 18.
that thou do accept our imperfect Repentance, and art pleased to forgive us;
and therefore all Love, all glory be to thee.

Glory be to Thee, O most adorable Trinity, for thy infinite Love in our
Forgiveness Romans 5. 8. 10.
; Glory be to Thee, O Father forgiving, O Son propitiating, O Holy Ghost
Purifying, I miserable Sinner, who sigh, and pant, and languish for thy
Forgiveness, and to be at peace with Thee Romans 5. 1.
; praise, and adore, and love that most sweet, and liberal, and tender, and
amiable Mercy, that delights in forgiving Sinners.

The Resurrection of the Body.
I believe, 2. Triumphant Resurrection.
O Victorious (...) by the Virtue of thy Resurrection, all the (...) shall rise
1: Cor. 15. 20.
, bad as well as good, John 5. 28, 29.
all Love, an Glory be to thee, by whom Death is swallowed up in Victory 1.
Cor. 15. 54,


I believe, O Almighty Jesu, that by thy power, All shall rise* with the same
bodies they had on earth Job 19. 26.
, that thou will recollect their scattered dust into the same form again, that
our Souls shall be reunited to our bodies, that we shall be judged both in
body and Soul, for the sins committed by both; that the bodies of the wicked
shall be fitted for torment, and the bodies of the Saints changed in Quality,
and made glorified Bodies 1. Cor. 15. 53. Phil. 3. 2^.
, immortal and incorruptible, sitted for Heaven, and eternally to love and
enjoy thee; for which glorious Vouchsafement I will always praise and love thee.

And the Life Everlasting.
I believe, Happiness Eternal.
O Great JUDGE of Heaven and earth, that after all the Quick and Dead have
appeared before thy Judgment Seat, then the most just and (...) Sentence shall
pass, and be executed to all Eternity; joyful only to these that love Thee: and
therefore, All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

I believe, O righteous Jesu, that the Wicked shall be set on thy left Hand,
and be damned to Hell, to be tormented with everlasting and unconceiveable
Anguish and Despair, by the Devil and his Angels, Mat. 25. 41.
and their own Conscience, Both in Soul and body, in the lake of Fire and
Brimstone Rev. 14. 10, 11
, from which there never can be any Redemption; O just reward of those that do
not love thee!

O merciful (...) ^ow desireous art Thou that we should be (...) in loving
Thee, when Thou have created Hell on purpose to deterr us from hating thee, and
Heaven, to compel us to love thee; and, therefore all Love all glory be to Thee.

I believe, O my Lord and my God, that the Righteous shall be rewarded with
Joys un speakable, and full of glory, with the beatisick Vision and Love of Thy
Self in heaven 1. Joh.3. 2.
, with the Happiness of Body and Soul, which shall be in all respects most
perfect, 1. Cor. 13. 12.
eternal, and unchangeable 1. Pet 1. 4.
, that they shall never sorrow nor sin more Rev. ^1. 4.
, which is all the free gift of thy infinite Love Mat. 25. 34.
, O heavenly Father, and the purchase of thy blood, O God incarnate; for which
I will ever, to the utmost of my power, adore and love thee.

O boundless Love, when shall I love thee in Heaven, without either Coldness or
interruption, which (alas, too often) seize me here below?

When, O my God, O when shall I have the transporting Vision of thy most
amiable Goodness, that I may unalterably love Thee, that I may never more
offend thee?

O thou whom my soul loves, I would not desire Heaven, but because Thou art
there, for Thou (...) Heaven wherever Thou art.

I would not, O Jesu, desire Life everlasting, but that I may there
everlastingly love Thee.

O inexhaustible Love, do Thou eternally breathe Love into me, that my Love to
Thee may be eternally increasing, and tending toward infinity, since a Love
less than infinite is not worthy of thee.

Amen.
O Thou great Author and Finisher of our Faith, do Thou daily increase my
Faith, and heighten my Love; O grant that in holy Ardours of Love to Love
crucified, my Love may at last ascend to the Region of Love, that I may have
nothing to do, to all Eternity, but to praise and to love thee. Amen, O
infinite LOVE, AMEN, AMEN.

how the Ten Commandments contain the Fruits, or Effects of Divine Love.

A. JESUS our Love, the great Prophet of Love, has given us this Trial of our
Love, If ye love Me, keep my commandments Joh. 14. 15.
.

Q. Are there not some general Rules, very useful to be observed, in expounding
the Commandments?

A. Divine Love does suggest to us the best Rules, and is the best Expositour
to teach us the full importance of every Command.

Q. Show me how.

A. The Love of God does necessarily include these two things, a Tenderness to
^^ease, and a Fearfulness to offend our Beloved, and this Love will besure to
guide thy in both the Affirmative, and the negative part of each Command.

Q.Express this more distinctly.

A.I shall do it in these following Particulars.

4. O my God, Rules for Expounding the Commandments.
when in any of thy Commands a Duty is enjoined, Love tells me the contrary evil
is forbidden; When any Evil is forbidden, Love tells me the contrary Duty is
enjoined 2 Cor. 6^, 14.
; O do thou daily increase my Love to Good, and my Antipathy to Evil.

2. Though thy Commands and Prohibitions, O Lord, are in general terms, yet let
thy Love direct my particular Practice, and teach me, that in are general are
implied all the kinds, and degrees, and Occasions, are incitements, and
Approaches, and Allowances relating to Good or Evil. which are also commanded
Mat. 5^. 21, 22, 28. 1. These 5. 22.
or forbidden, and give are grace to pursue, or to (...)

3. O my God, keep my Love always watchful, and (...) in thy negative Precepts
I am contim^^; resist Evil; keep my love warm with a (...) Zeal, that in all
thy Affirmative precepts I may lay hold on all S^asous and (...) of doing Good.

4. Let thy Love, O Thou that only art worthy to be beloved make me careful to
persuade, and engage others to love thee, and to keep thy Commandments, as well
as my self Heb. 10^. 24.
.

5. None can love Thee, O Lord, and endeavor to keep thy Holy Commands, Mat.
5. 16.
but his daily (...) in his Duty, his frequent involuntary and unavoidable
(...) and S^^reptions and wanderings (...) and humble him Pro.24. 16.
the infirmities (...) laps't nature create him a kind of a perpetual
Martyrdom, because he can love thee no more, because he can so little serve
thee.

But Thou O most compassionate Father, in thy Covenant of Grace, do require
sincerity 2. Cor.8. 12.
, not Perfection; and therefore I praise and love thee.

O my God, though I cannot love and obey thee as much as I desire, I will do it
as much as I am able, I will to the utmost of my power keep all thy
Commandments with my whole heart, and to the end Psalm. 119. 2, 6, 112.
; O accept of my imperfect Duty, and supply all the Defects of it by the
Merits, and love, and obedience of Jesus thy beloved.

6. Glory be to Thee, O thou supreme Lawgi^er, for delivering these Commands to
sinful (...) they are the Words which Thou thy Self, (...) JEHOVAH, did
speak, O let me ever have an awful regard for every Word (...) have spoken; O
let me ever love thee for speaking them, and for giving us the Laws of Love.

7. Glory be to Thee, O Lord God, who to make everyone of us sensible of our
Obligation, have given all thy Commands in the second Person, and by saying
Thou, have spoken in particular to every Soul, that every soul might love and
obey thee.

Glory be to thee, O my God, who in this short Abstract, in these Ten
Commandments have comprised the full extent of our Duty, all the Effects of
Divine Love

Teach me O Lord to examine my Love by thy Commands, that I may know how to
please Thee, that I may know wherein I have offended Thee, and grieve for my
O(...), that I may bewail all my Commissions of Sin,all my Omissions of duty.

Teach me, O Lord, by this thy Law, which is the Rule of Love, and of all my
Actions, to examine not only my several Sins, but also all the several
Aggravations, whether they have been wilful, or known, or frequent, or
obstinate, or habitual or ensnareing to others, that Love may shed the more
tears, and in some measure proportion my Contrition to my guilt.

8. Glory be to Thee, O Lord God, who give us Christians higher obligations
to keep thy Commands than thou did to the Jews, they had only the memory of
their temporal Deliverance out of the ^and of Egypt, and the House of Bondage
set before them, we are delivered out of Spiritual Egypt, from the Bondage of
Sin, the power of Satan, and the Torments of Hell; O give us grace to exceed
them as much in our Love and Thanksgiving, and Obedience, as we do in our
Blessings.

9. Glory be to thee, O thou Great JEHOVAH, who to constrain us to love and
obey Thee, art pleased to honor every faithful soul with a near and intimate
Propriety in Thy Self, and graciously to declare, I am the LORD thy GOD.

O merciful Lord, what is it possible for me to desire more than to have thee
for my God Gen 17. 7
? if thou be my God, Deuteronomy 26. 17.
the Relation ought to be (...), Exodus.19. 5. 6.
and I must be thy Servant; Lord be thou (...), and I will be for ever thine

My (...) is mine, and I am His.

My God, my Father, my Friend, my Love, whatever is thine I will love, and
particularly thy Law will love for teaching me to love thee*thy Law I will
highly esteem, and diligently read and study, thy Lawshall be daily my Delight,
my Counselor and my Meditation Psalm. 119. 24. 97.


O my good God, keep me always thine, and let nothing ever divorce me from thy
Love.

Q. You have laid down proper Rules for interpreting the Commandments, Show me
now how they are divided.

A. Into two sorts or Tables, suitable to the two respects they have, to GOD,
and to our Neighbor.

Q.Begin with the First Table, and show me the Number and Order of the Commands
which it contains.

A.It contains the four first Commands which relate to God, The First Table.
and to teach us the worship of God, even that Reverential Love we are to pay
to God, which naturally arises from a true sense of His infinite both Goodness
and Greatness.

This Worship of God is either inward or outward.

The inward Worship, being that of the Heart, is the nobler of the two, and
this, together with the right Object of our worship is taught in the first
Commandment, as the Foundation of all the rest.

The outward is comprised in the three following, which teach us the Regulation
of God's Worship in reference to our (...) in the Second, to our Tongues in the
Third, to our Time in the Fourth.

Q. Which are the Duties of the Second Table?

A. They are the six remaining Commands which do all relate to our Neighbor;
of which I shall speak in their due place.

Q. What have you further to observe of the Commandments in general?

A. It Is observable that those which refer to God are put first, to teach us
that the Love of God is the chief and original Command, and ought chiesy to be
studied; and to teach us also, that all the Duties of the Second Table must
yield to the First, whenever they stand in any Competition Luc. 14. 26.
.

Q. Go over all the Ten Commandments in particular, and show me how they are
all the genuine Fruits and Effects of Divine Love, exercised either in Doing
Good, or Eschewing Evil.

A. I shall gladly do it, and as distinctly as possibly I can, taking every
Commandment apart.

The First Commandment.

to all sacred Persons, or places Lev. 19. 30.
, or things Ezekiel. 22. 8. 26.
, which are thine by solemn (...), and separated for the Uses of Divine Love,
and the Communications of thy Grace or which may promote the Decency and Order
of thy Worship, or the Edification of faithful people (...) 14 4 -- 26, 40.
.

O my God, O my Love, let thy All-powerful (...) abound in my heart and in the
hearts of air that profess thy Name, that in vil these, and in all other
possible instances of thy love, our Souls may be continually employed to praise
and to love Thee, etc. as p. 49.

Thou, O my God, O my Love, art a Jealous GOD, The Reason of the Commandment.
jealous of thy own Honor Deuteronomy. 4. 2 (...) If. (...). 8. Exodus 34. 14, 15.
, and of the Chastness of my Love; O let me never run after other loves, or
commit spiritual Adultery against thee, to provoke thee to Anger

Thou, O my God, O my Love, do visit the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the
Children; Thou, when thy jealousy burns like fire Ps. 79. 5.
against Idolaters and those that rob thee of thy Worship, art wont to punish
them in their very posterity, with temporal evils, and with spiritual too, when
their children tread in their steps; for then thou make their Father's sins
occasions of hastening, or of increasing thy judgments, though thou always
sparest the Children that repent Isa. 65. 6, 7. Ezekiel. 18. 17. 20. Jer. 31. 30.
; O let thy just indignation against violating Thy Worship, deter me and all
that profess thy Name, from such Violations.

Thy Jealousy, O my God, O my Love, falls heavy upon them that hate Thee; but
how is it possible for any-one to hate Thee, who art infinite Love? and yet,
alas! all that are Enemies to thy Divine Worship; all that exalt any Lust, any
Creature into thy Throne, to ascribe their Happiness, to sacrifice their
Esteem, and Zeal and Affections, and to offer up Sovereign Honors to it; what
do they do but love false gods, and hate thee, and are therefore hated by Thee
Deuteronomy 7. 10


O Lord God, to hate Thee is the proper Character of Devils, and Lucifer
himself cannot sin bevond that utmost extremity of evil, the Hatred of Thee;
and my heart is full of horror and grief to think, that ever those that bear
thy image, and daily subsist by thy Love, should turn themselves into Devils,
and this world into a Hell, by hating Thee 1. Job. 3. 8. Romans 1. 30. Job. 15.
18.
: O boundless Love, turn them, O turn them into men again, and then they cannot
choose but love thee.

Glory be to thee, O my God, who show mercy to them that love thee, and keep
thy Commandments: Love and Obedience always go together, and entail a blessing
on the Posterity of thy Lovers Deuteronomy 4. 46.
; O keep me always one of that happy number; O let me ever love and obey Thee.

Glory be to Thee, O Lord God, whose Love is more diffusive than thy Anger; thy
Vengeance extends but to the Third, or, at most, the Fourth Generation, thy
Mercy unto Thousands; and the more diffused thy Love is, the more powerfully it
moves us, to praise and to love Thee.

The Third Commandment.
O my God, O my Love, the NAME is thy own glorious and amiable Self Psalm. 83.
18.
, thy Divine Nature, and perfections, and works, Duties commanded.
most worthy to be adored, most worthy to be loved Ps. 5. 11. Ps. 29. 2. -- 72.
19. Ezekiel. 36. 23. Neh. 9. 5.
, and therefore I will always adore and love thy Name.

O my God, O my Love, may I ever have awful Thoughts of thee Ps. 111. (...)
, may I never mention thy venerable Name, unless on solemn, and just, and
devout occasions; may I never mention it on those occasions without acts of
Love and Adoration Isa 12. 4. -- 48. 1.


O my God, O my Love, to love and to glorify thy Name is the great end of our
Creation, which is still more enforced by our Redemption; O let it be the
greatest business of my whole life to love, and to glorify it all the possible
ways I can, by my Mouth Ps. 51. 15
, by my Conversation Maat 5. 16
, by my public Confession of Thee before men, even to Death -- g 10 32. 1. Pet
3. 15
, whenever Thou art pleased to call me to it, by engaging all I can to
glorify and love Thee; O happy life, O blessed death, which is spent, and
expires in glorifying, in Loving Thee!

O my God, O my Love, my heart shall ever be jealous of Thy Name 1. King. 19.
10.
: I can have no true love, no real Concern for Thee if I do not, to the utmost
of my power, assert and vindicate the Name of my Beloved, whenever I hear it
dishonored.

O my God, O my Love, fix in my soul an habitual pure Intention of Thy Glory in
all my Actions, that whether I eat or drink, or whatever I do, I may do all
to the Glory 1. Cor. 10. 31.
of my Beloved.

Oaths,
O my God, The Honor of GOD' s Name is more particularly concerned in Oaths.
O my Love, fill me with a religious Aw of Oaths, in which the Honor of Thy
beloved Name is so highly concerned,

I know, O great Jehovah, that in an Oath I solemnly invoke Thee, as a Witness
to attest the truth of what I swear Genesis 31. 50, 53.
, as a Judge to punish me if I swear falsely.

Far be it from me, O Lord God, ever to swear, and in swearing to invoke Thee,
unless upon Inducements Lawful and important, when thy Glory Deuteronomy 6. 13
, the Command of my Superiors, the visible Good of my Neighbor, the ending of
strife Heb 6. 16,
or my own Innocence obliges me to it.

O Lord God, whenever I am duly ca'lld to an Assertory Oath, grant I may swear
in truth, in righteousness, and in judgment Jer. 4. 2.
.

Whatever lawful promissory Oaths I take, Lord give me grace conscientiously to
perform them, though to my own hinderance Ps 15. 4. 2 Samuel 21. 7


Vows.
The Glory of Thy most beloved NAME, O great JEHOVAH, next to the truth of our
Oaths we invoke thee to attest, is concerned in the Sincerity of those Vows we
offer Thee to accept Eccles.5. 4, 5.
; O do Thou therefore create in me a serious sense of the Religiousness of
Vows, that my Vows may not dishonor thee.

O my God, O my Love, whenever I voluntarily vow a vow to Thee, give me grace
to vow with all the due Caution I can, that I may vow those things only which
are lawful and acceptable to thee Gen 28, 20, 21. 22.
, and which thou have put in my power Numb. 30. 5, 8.
, that I may vow with deliberation, and ghostly advice, and on weighty and
considerable occasions only, and with a design of Glory Ps. 132. 2
, and Thankfulness, and Love to Thee.

O my God, O my Love, give me grace faithfully to perform all the Vows I make
to Thee 61. 8.
, especially my Baptismal Vow, and all my repeated vows of amendment, in which
I have so often vowed to glorify and love thy Name.

O my God, O my Love, let thy All-powerful Love abound in my heart, and in the
hearts of all that profess thy Name, that in all these, and in all other
possible instances of Thy Love, our Souls may be continually employed, to
praise and so love thee.

O my God, O my Love, who is there that Knows thy great, thy beloved NAME, can
ever in the least dishonor Deuteronomy. 28. 58.
it?

O my God, Sins forbidden.
O my Love, I renounce, and detest, and bewail, as odious and Offensive to
thee, as directly opposite to thy love, and to thy glory,

All taking of thy Name in vain.

All use of it on trivial occasions, and without holy Aw Psalm. 139. 20.
,

All abuse of it in impious Jests, in Charms, or Curses, or imprecations, or
Telling Fortunes, or Exploratory Lots Deuteronomy. 18. 10, 11, 12.
; all irreverent Thoughts of Thy Name Psalm. 10, 11, 13. 50. 21.
, profaneness and Blasphemy Ja. 24. 7. Lev. 4. 16.
.

All Denying Thee by my works Tit. 1. 16
, or Refusing publicly to confess thee, when called to it Joh. 12. 42.
, or tamely enduring to hear Thee dishonored Psalm. 139. 21.
.

All heathenish, or castomary, or rash oaths, or Swearing in ordinary
Communication, or by any Creature Mat. 5. 34, 35, 36. 37.
.

All Breaking of lawful Oaths, perjury, falseswearing, and invoking thee, O God
of Truth, to attest a Lie, sins most destructive to public Faith and Society,
and to our own souls, and most dishonorable and hateful to thee Zech. 8. 17.
5. 4. Jer. 23. 10. Hos. 4. 2, 3
.

All hasty or unlawful, or superstitious, or impossible vows Mal. 1. 14. Jer.
44. 25.
, all breaking those that are regularly made Ps. 22. 25
.

All the least Tendencies to any of these impieties.

From all these and the like hateful violations of thy Love and from that
vengeance they justly deserve O my God, O my Love, deliver me, and deliver all
faithful people.

O great Jehovah, The Threat annexed to the Commandment.
Thou art Jealous for thy glorious and beloved Name, and without a particular
and serious Repentance Thou will not hold him guiltless that takes it in vain;
thou will pour on him the vials of thy wrath, thy wrath eternal 74. 10, 18 22,
23.
, and yet Thy ever blessed Name, is, alas, alas, daily, hourly blasphemed Isai.
5. 52
.

O Apostate, infamous World, wherein Infinite Goodness is so often blasphemed;
were not thy Name 1. John 4. 8.
Love, O Lord, as well as JEHOVAH, Thou had long ago avenged thy self of the
blasphemous world, with a Vengeance worthy of God.

Glory be to thee, O long suffering Love, for thy forbearance, efficacious of
it self to convert the whole world, did the world but seriously consider it.

O Almighty Love, Thou can as easily diffuse thy Love over the world, as thou
did at first diffuse Light; O let thy Fear, and thy Love so universally
affect the Age, that thy great and beloved Name may be universally adored and
loved!

The Fourth Commandment.
Glory be to thee, Duties commanded.
O my God, O my Love, who in compassion to humane weakness, which is not
capable of an uninterrupted contemplation of thee, such as the Saints have
above, have appointed a solemn Day on purpose for thy Remembrance.

Glory be to thee, O my God, my Love, for proportioning a Seventh part of our
time to thy Self, and liberally indulging the remainer to our own use.

O my God, O my Love, let me ever esteem it my Privilege, and my Happiness to
have a Day of Rest set apart for thy Service Is 58. 13.
, and the Concerns of my own soul; to have a Day free from Distractions,
disengaged from the World, wherein I have nothing to do, but to praise, and to
love Thee.

Lord, grant that I may not only-on thy Day give Thee due Worship my self, but
may give Rest and Leisure also to my Family, to all under my Charge to serve
Thee also Josh. 24. 15.
, to indulge ease to my very Beasts, since good men are merciful even to them
Pro 12. 10


Glory be to Thee O Blessed Spirit, who on the First Day of the Week did
descend in miraculous Gifts and Graces on the Apostles Act. 2. 1.
; O descend upon me, that I may be always in the Spirit on the Lord's Day.

O my God, O my Love, give me Grace on thy Day to worship Thee in my Closet,
and in the Congregation, to spend it in Doing good Mar. 3. 4
in works of Necessity, Devotion and Charity, in Prayer, and Praise, and
Meditation; O let it ever be to me a day Sacred to Divine Love, a Day of
heavenly Rest and Refreshment.

Thou, O my God, O my Love did ordain the Jewdaical Sabbath as a shadow of
the true GospelSabbath Col. 2. 16. 17.
; O may I every day keep an Evangelical Sabbath, and rest from my Sins, which
are my own works, while I live here, and may I celebrate an eternal Sabbath
with Thee Heb. 4. 9.
in Heaven hereafter.

O my God, O my Love, for the like purposes of Piety, and of thy Glory, give me
grace to sanctify the Feasts and Fasts of thy Church Ps. 42. 4. If. 58. 6, 7.
-- 8. 10.
as in the number of those happy Days set apart for the Remembrance of thy Love.

Glory be to Thee, O Lord God, who did command the Sabbath, Reason of the
Commandment.
or Seventh day to be kept Holy, and strictly observed by the Jews, as Thy
Sabbath, in Memory of the Creation Genesis 2. 2.
; of Thy making Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and of thy
Resting the Seventh Day; of thy Blessing the Seventh Day, and hallowing it.

We Christians, O Lord God, following the Moral Equity of thy Command, and
Authorized by Apostolical Practice Act 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 2
, celebrate the Lord's Day Rev. 1. 10
, the First Day of the Week, in Memory of our Redemtion, in Memory of thy
Resurrection from the Dead, O most beloved Jesu, when Thou did rest from the
Labors and Sorrows of the New Creation Luc. 24. 1.
; O may I ever remember thy Day, and Thee.

Glory be to Thee, O my God, my Love, who have under the Gospel delivered us
from the Rigours, but not from the Pietyof the Jewish Sabbath.

Lord, since the Blessing of everlasting Salvation, which we Christians on thy
day commemorate, does wonderfully exceed the Creation commemorated by the Jews;
O let our Love, and Praise, and Devotion, and Zeal, proportionably exceed their
also Mat 5. 20
.

O my God, O my Love, let thy all-powerful Love abound b Phil. 1. 9.
in my heart, and in the hearts of all that profess my Name, that in all these,
and all other possible instances of thy Love, our Souls may be continually
employed to praise, and to love Thee.

Next to thy Glorious Self, The Second Table.
O my God, O my Love, and for the sake of thy Supreme, independent Love, Thou
have commanded me to love my Neighbor, allied to me, by nature, or by Grace,
all Strangers and Enemies, as well as Friends, Luk.10. 29, 30.
; to honor all men, as being made after thy likeness, and the greater likeness
they retain to Thee, to honor them the more 1 Pet. 2. 17.
. Glory be to Thee.

Thou, O my God, O my Love, have commanded me to love my Neighbor as my self,
O for the sake of thy Love, give me Love to relieve and assist him in all
instances wherein he may need my help, as freely, as fully, as affectionately
as I my self would desire to be treated, were I in his Condition Mat 7. 12

my Neighbor, not in word and in tongue only, but in deed, and in truth 1 John
3. 18.

and to give them for thy sake all lawful, and reasonable and necessary Succors
Col. 3. 12.


Glory be to Thee, O my God, O my Love, who by commanding me to love my
Neighbor as my self, do imply the Regular Love of my self Ephesians. 5. 29.
that I should do all I can to preserve my self free and vigourous to glorify
thee in my station: It Is for thy sake only I can love my self; and he does not
wish or endeavor his own Happiness, he really hates himself, that does not
love Thee.

Thou Lord, by enjoining me to love my Neighbor as my self, have intimated my
duty of loving those best, which either in blood are nearest my natural self,
or in Grace nearest my Christian self; O let thy Love teach me to observe the
true order of Charity in loving others.

O Thou eternal Fountain of Goodness, give me Grace to imitate that boundless
Goodness, let thy Love work in me an universal propension to love, and to do
good to all men: to be merciful to others, as thou Lord art merciful Luc.6. 36.
.

Q. Show me how the Love of your Neighbor is in the Second Table divided.

A. The Love of my Neighbor, which is the Fulfilling of the Law, of all the
Commands of the Second Table, is divided according to those different
Conditions of our Neighbor, wherein we most exercise our Love or Hatred to him.

Q. In how many ruling instances may we exercise that Love of Hatred?

A. Either in outward Acts, or in inward Disposition.

Q. How in outward Acts?

A. Five several ways, in respect of his Superiority, in the Fifth Commandment.

His Bed in the Seventh.

His Propriety in the Eighth; or His good Name in the Ninth.

love and honor, to fear and obey our Sovereign Lord the King, thy own
Vicegerent, for conscience sake Romans 13, 1, etc. 1 Pet 2. 13. Tit. 3. 1, ^

render Him His due Tribute; O may we ever pray for His Prosperity, sacrifice
our Fortunes and our Lives in His Defense, and be always ready rather to suffer
than resist.

Q. My good Child, know this, that thou art not able to do these things of thy
self, nor to walk in the Commandments of God, and to serve him, without His
special grace, which thou must learn at all times to call for by ailigent
Prayer let me hear therefore if thou can say the Lord's Prayer.

A. Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come,
thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven, give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our Trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
us, and lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.

Q. What desire thou of God in this Prayer?

A. I desire my Lord God, our heavenly Father, who is the Giver of all
Goodness, to send his Grace unto me, and to all people, that we may worship
Him, serve Him, and obey him as we ought to do. And I pray unto God that He
will send us all things that be needful both for our Souls and Bodies, and that
He will be merciful unto us, and forgive us our Sins, and (...) it will please
Him to save and defend us in all Dangers ghostly and bodily, and that He will
keep us from all Sin and Wickedness, and from our ghostly Enemy and from
everlasting Death: and this I trust He will do of His Mercy and Goodness,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore I say AMEN, so (...) it.

O infinite Lord, Previous Considerations.
it is my duty and my happiness to love Thee; but alas! my own sad experience
teaches me, how little able I am to love.

Ah Lord, Our Impotence to good.
there is a dark cloud of Ignorance spread over my Soul, that intercepts thy
beams, I cannot clearly see, I cannot fully know how lovely thou art.

Ah Lord, when ever any Gleams of thy Loveliness break in upon my spirit, and
attract my Will; a crowd of strange Loves importune and tempt me to wander
after them.

Since, O my God, I can of my self neither know, nor love Thee, God is our
Refuge.
since I cannot by my own strength do those things thou requirest, nor walk in
thy Commandments, nor serve thee. nor think so much as one good thought 2 Cor
3. 5
: whether can I fly but only to thy free and unbounded Love? Thou art my Hope
my Help, and my Salvation Ps. 62. 7. Joh 15. 4, 5
; Thou only can teach and enable me to know, and to love thy own Goodness.

By thy Special Grace, O my God, by thy particular Assistance, Our Assistance
from God.
by the strength of thy Love I can do all things Ephesians. 3. 16. Phil. 4. 13.
: O let thy Grace ever enlighten and inflame me; let it ever prevent, and
accompany, and follow me; let it ever excite, and increase, and support thy
Love in my heart; O let it ever work in me; both to will and to do of thy good
pleasure 2. 13.
.

I know, Gained by Prayer.
Lord, that thy Grace, and all other Blessings I must learn at all times to
call for by diligent Prayer, and I adore and love thy infinite Benignity to
Sinners, in indulging us the privilege, the Honor, the Happiness to pray to
thee Romans 10. 13.
, to pour out our Souls, to breathe out our Desires, to present our wants, and
to unbosome our Griefs at thy Throne of Love.

I praise and I love Thee, Encouragements to pray.
O Sovereign Love, for not only permitting us miserable wretches to pray to
Thee, but also for giving us all imaginable Encouragement to so important and
Divine a Duty.

I adore and love Thee, O munificent Goodness, for inviting Psalm. 50. 15.
for Commanding us to pray Phil. 4. 6.
: I adore and love Thee, for pouring out thy holy Spirit of Grace and
supplication on us Zech. 12. 10.
to help our infirmities, to assist us in praying, to make intercession for us
with sighs, and groans that cannot be uttered Rom 8. 25
with the utmost ardours of a penitential and indigent Love. I adore and love
Thee for giving us so many glorious Promises Mat. 7. 7.
of hearing our Prayers, so many firm Assurances of a gracious Acceptance.

O Thou great Prophet of Divine Love, A Pattern of Prayer.
who, as if they Invitation, and Command, and Assistance, and Promise were not
enough to move us to pray; have condescended to teach us this Duty thy Self,
and to give us a perfect pattern of Prayer, for which I adore and love thee.

Glory be to Thee, A Form most Condescending.
O blessed Master of Devotion, who in dictating a Form of Prayer, and enjoying
us to use it 6. 7, 8, 9. Lu^. 11. 2.
, have complied with our Weakness, and warned us not to rely on rash and
unpremeditated Effusions; who in dictating a short Form, have taught us to
avoid vain Repetitions, or thinking we shall be heard for much speaking, and to
measure our Prayers rather by their Fervency than length.

That Prayer which was composed by thy own self, most Divine.
O God that hear prayer, we are sure is most divine and excellent, and
perfect like its Author; and most agreeable and acceptable to Thee, for which
I adore and love Thee.

O blessed Jesus, the only beloved of God, Thou best Understandest the Language
of Love, most Acceptable.
and in that language Thou have taught us to pray, and whenever we pray in that
language, we have an humble Confidence thy heavenly Father will hear us; who
with the words of His own beloved Son will ever be well pleased; and therefore
I adore and love Thee.

Thou, O heavenly Guide of our Devotion and and our Love, Necessity of Prayer.
by teaching us to pray, have showed us, that Prayer is our Treasury, where all
Blessings are kept, our Armory, where all our strength and Weapons are stored,
the only great Preservative, and the very vital Heat of Divine Love.

Give me grace therefore to call on Thee at all times by diligent Prayer.

O the unspeakable misery of those who either totally neglect the duty of
Prayer Ps. 10. 4.
, or else profane it by drawing near to God with their Lips, Misery of those
who do not Pray.
when their hearts are far removed from Him, whose Prayers being void of all
Devotion and Concern, are turned into fresh Sins 109. ^
: How deservedly shall he have God for his Enemy, who would not beg pardon of a
most Reconcilable Father? How deservedly shall he suffer eternal Wrath, who
thought Heaven not worth the Asking!

O my God, let me daily offer up to Thee my morning and evening Sacrifice 5. 3.
141. 2.
in private, Prayer ought to be daily.
and in public too, if my circumstances permit; and as near as I can let me
omit no opportunities of Praying, or of Praising Thee.

O my God, may I ever keep my self in Thy Love, Incessant.
by praying in the Holy Ghost Jude 20. 21.
and by Praying without out ceasing 1 These. 5. 17.
, since I incessantly want the Succors of thy Love.

Ah Lord, I know my Devotion has daily many unavoidable and necessary
interruptions, and I cannot always be actually praying; all I can do is to beg
of thy Love, to keep my heart always in an habitual Disposition to Devotion,
and in Mindfulness of thy Divine presence, that I may perpetuate my Prayer by
frequent Ejaculations.

O my God, as thy infinite Love is ever streaming in Blessings on me; O let my
soul be ever breathing Love on Thee.

O my God, Joined with Reading and Meditation.
to Prayer (whereby I address to Thee) give me grace to add the daily reading
and meditation of thy Word Psalm. 1. 2.
, whereby thou art pleased to converse with me.

It is thy abundant Love to us, O Lord, that Thou indulgest us thy Word in our
own mother Tongue, that from those dear Volumns of thy Love, every devout Lover
may daily and on all occasions supply proper Fuel to his Love; for which all
Love, all Glory be to Thee.

I adore and love Thee, O heavenly Oracle of Love, The Method of Prayer.
for contriving this Prayer in that admirable Method; that Thou have withal
taught us all all the Requisites of an acceptable prayer; Thou in the Preface
have taught us how to pray; in the Petitions for what to pray; and in the
Conclusion what ought to be the End of our Prayers: for which I adore and love
Thee.

FATHER.

Children by Adoption for the same heavenly Father. O give me that Brotherly

self, and earnestly pray that they may all share with me in thy Fatherly Love.

Which art in Heaven.
Glory be to Thee, with the Humility of a Supplicant.
O Thou beloved of the Father, who in teaching us to pray to Our Father in
Heaven, have taught me the infinite Distance between GOD and us, to pray with
the Humility of a Supplicant Eccl. 5. 1. Heb. 12. 28, 29.
with that Aw that becomes a frail Creature, a miserable Sinner, before his
Creator, and his Judge.

O Father Almighty, though Thou fillest all places, yet thy Glory is most
manifested in Heaven, and there thy Majesty does most illustriously dwell, and
to thy Throne there Psalm. 11. 4. Is. 57. 15.
are we to lift up our Hearts when we pray, O let my soul fly up to Thee (when
I pray) in heavenly Thoughts and Desires, and Love: O let me savor nothing of
the Earth, whenever I treat with Thee in Heaven!

Glory be to Thee, Petitions in general teach us for what to Pray.
O Gracious Lord, who in the Petitions of thy most Divine Prayer, have taught
us for what we are to pray, for all Blessings temporal, and eternal, for all
things lawful, and according to thy Will 1 John 5. 14. 15.

taught us to seek Heaven in the first place Mat. 6. 33.

may pray for Blessings Spiritual with holy Violence Mat. 11. 12.

Ingredients of thy Love, In particular for Blessings Spiritual relating to God.
and absolutely necessary to my Eternal welfare Genesis 32. 26.

love Thee, and be eternally happy without them.

Hallowed be Thy Name.
O Lord God, may Thy Name, Psalm. 8. 1, 9. 111. 9.

Glory be to Thee, O Lord, who to teach us Charity, have made our Forgiveness,
the Condition of obtaining Thine.

O easy, O Gracious Condition of Pardon, who would not forgive his Brother a
few Pence in this life, to have ten thousand Talents Mat. 18. 22, 24, 28.
forgiven in the next!

O let my Love, Lord, learn from thine, not only to forgive my Enemies, but to
be zealous also to do them good.

And lead us not into Temptation.
O Lord God, thou see how our Ghostly Enemies, the World, the Flesh, and the
Devil, are every moment soliciting, enticing, alluring, or tempting us to Evil;
O be merciful unto us, save, and help, and deliver us.

Thou see, O my GOD, how infirm I am, and how ready my own deceitful heart is
Jer. 17. 9
to surrender it self to the Tempter; and I know that Satan cannot Tempt me
without thy permission Mat. 8. 3^.
: O lead me not, if it be thy Good pleasure, suffer me not to fall into violent
or lasting Temptations, that may endanger my Persevereance.

I know, O heavenly Father, that to be tempted is no sin, for thy own Beloved
Son, God incarnate, 4. 1, 9.
was tempted to the most horrid of all Sins, to fall down and worship the very
Devil, I know Lord the Sin lies in Yielding to the Temptation.

O my God, if thou for trial of my Love, lead me into any great Temptation, and
let me continue under it, Thy Will, Lord, be done, not mine 1 Cor. 10. 13. 1
Pet. 5. 8. 2 Cor. 12. 7. 9. Jam. 4. 7.
: O let thy paternal Tenderness limit and control the Tempter: O let thy
All-sufficient Grace restrain my Consent. and keep me always off my Guard,
watching and praying, and let me at last be more than a Conqueror.

I am content, Lord, to be tried and assaulted, so I be not wicked, though it
be grievous for those that love Thou to be tempted to offend thee.

But deliver us from evil.
O Father of Mercy, If Thou think fit to Lead me into Temptation, Deliver me
from the Evil to which I am tempted: Deliver me from the Evil of Sin, and the
Evil of Punishment, from the evil One 1 John 2. 14.
, from the evil World Gal. 1. 4.
, and from my one evil Heart Heb 3. 12.
, and from all Suggestions to Evil; for all that is evil is most hateful to
Thee (who art Infinite Goodness) and most destructive of thy Love. And
therefore, from all that is Evil, O Almighty Lord, defend me.

For thine is the Kingdom, The Conclusion teaches to pray for a right End,
God's, Glory.
and the Power and the Glory, for ever and ever.
I adore, and love thee, O Jesu, who by concluding this Prayer with a Doxology,
have taught us that the right end of our Prayers should be the Glory of God;
that we should be ever careful to mix Praise with our Prayers, and to be as
zealous to give Thanks for what we receive Phil. 4. 6. Neh 9. 5. 6.
, as to pray for what we want.

To thee, O Lord God do we pray, on thee, only we rely and depend for
acceptance, to thee only we offer up Praises, for thine is the Kingdom 1 Psalm.
47. 2, 7.
and Sovereign Right to dispose of all things, thine is the Power 135. 6.
Almighty, to relieve and bless us, Thine is the Glory 96. 7, 8.
. All the Communications of thy Goodness, as they flow from They return to Thee
again in Sacrifices of Love, of Praise, and Adoration.

AMEN.
For the sake, O Heavenly Father of thy Beloved 2 Cor. 1. 20. Rev. 3. 14.
, in whom all Thy Promises are Amen, and who is Himself he Amen, the Faithful
and true Witness of thy Love to us. Hear me, and pardon my Wanderings and
Coldness, and help me to sum up and enforce my whole prayer, all my own
Wants, and all the Wants of those I pray for, in a Hearty, and Fervent, and
Comprehensive. AMEN.

Q. How many Sacraments has Christ Ordained in His Church?

A. Two only, The Pledges of Love, the Sacraments.
as generally necessary to Salvation, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper
of the Lord.

Glory be to Thee, Their Number.
O Crucified Love: out of thy wounded side flowed Water and Blood Joh. 19. 34.
the two Sacraments which thou have Ordained in thy Church, Baptism, and the
Supper of the Lord, the one to initiate, the other to confirm us in our
Christianity.

Glory be to Thee O Lord, who having Ordained Two Sacraments only, and made
them General necessary to Salvation 3. 5. 6. 53
, art yet pleased to have Mercy rather than Sacrifice, in cases where they
cannot be had, and where a Surprise of Death may prevent their Administration,
thou do supply the want of them by thy merciful Acceptance of those persons
who earnestly desire, and who are disposed to receive them.

O Blessed Jesu, the greater thy Compassion is to those sincere Persons who
want thy Sacraments, by reason of their Infelicity, not their Choice, the
greater will be thy Indignation against those who wilfully Neglect, or contemn
Luc. 14. 24
what thy adoreab^^ Love has ordained to be (throughout thy thy whole Church)
used and Revered: From which Neglect and Contempt of thy Love, good Lord
Deliver me!

Q. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?

A. I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual Grace, Nature.
given unto us, ordained by Christ Himself, as means whereby we receive the
same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.

Q. How many Parts are there in a Sacrament?

A. Two: the outward visible Sign, and the inward Spiritual Grace.

Glory be to thee, O tenderest Love, who to (...) our weak and Gross
Apprehension, have in the two Sacraments made an Outward and Visible, and
familiar thing to be a Sign, and Memorial, and Representation, of an Inward and
invisible, Mysterious and Spiritual Grace.

Glory be to Thee, O bountiful Love, for Ordaining and giving us thy Holy
Sacraments Mat. 26. 26, 27. 28.
, Thou thy Self only art the Author and Fountain of Grace, and Thou only have
the Right of Instituting the Conveyances of thy own Grace: All Love, all Glory
be to Thee.

Glory be to thee, O Mighty Love, who have elevated these obvious and outward
signs, to an efficacy far above their Natures, not only to signify, but to be
happy Means, and instruments, to convey thy Grace to us; to be Seals, and
Pledges, to confirm and assure to us the Communications of thy Love, that our
sight may assist our Faith, that if with due preparation we receive them, both
the parts of the Sacrament will go together: as certainly as we receive the
Outward and visible (...), so certainly shall we receive the Inward and
invisible Grace: for which all Love, all Glory be to thee.

Q. What is the Outward Visible Sign, Baptism.
or Form in Baptism?

A. Water: wherein the Person is Baptized, In the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Q. What is the inward and Spiritual Grace?

A. A Death unto Sin, and a new Birth-unto Righteousness. For being by nature
born in sin, and the Children of Wrath, we are hereby made the Children of
Grace.

Q. What is required of Persons to be baptized?

A. Repentance; whereby they forsake sin, and Faith, whereby they steadfastly
believe the Promises of God, made to them in that Sacrament.

Q. Why then are Infants baptized, when by reason of their tender age they
cannot perform them?

A. Because they promise them both by their Sureties; which Promise, when they
come to age, themselves are bound to perform.

Glory be to Thee, The Outward Sign.
O Lover of Souls; it was by thy preventing Love, that I was Baptized with the
outward Sign, Water, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost Mat. 28, 19.
. That I should believe in the most Holy Trinity; that I should depend on the
gracious Assistances, and live wholly devoted to the. Three most adorable
persons, that it should be my chief care to love and glory that Tri-une Love,
the Author of my Salvation.

Glory be to thee O Jesu, who by (...), The invisible Grace.
that washes away the Filth of the Body, do represent to my Faith thy
invisible Grace in Baptism Ezekiel. 36. 25.
which spiritually washes and cleanses the soul.

Glory be to Thee, O blessed LORD, who in Baptism savest us, not by thy outward
Washing, but by the inward purifying Grace, accompanied with a sincere Vow, and
Stipulation of a good Conscience toward God 1 Pet. 8. 21.
; by which thy propitious Love brought me into thy Church, the spiritual Ark,
to save me from perishing in the Deluge of Sin, which overwhelms the generality
of the World: and therefore all Love, all Glory be to thee.

Glory be to Thee, O All-powerful Love, by whose invisible Grace, we in baptism
die to Sin Romans 6. 3, 4.
to all carnal Affections, renouncing and detesting them all, and resolving to
take no more pleasure in them than dead Persons do in the Comforts of life. O
may I ever thus die to Sin!

Glory be to thee, O Jesu, who from our Death to Sin in our Baptism, do raise
us to a new life, and do breathe into us the Breath of Love^ it is in this
Laver of Re^eneration Tit. 3. 5.
we are born again by Water Joh. 3. 5.
and (...), by a New Birth unto Righteousness: that (...) the Natural Birth
propagated Sin, our Spiritual Birth should propagate Grace: for which, All
Love, all Glory be to Thee.

Glory be to Thee, O most indulgent Love, who in our Baptism do give us the
Holy Spirit of Love to be the principle of new Life, and of Love in us, to
infuse into our souls a supernatural Habitual Grace, and Ability to obey and
love Thee: for which, All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

Glory be to thee, O Compassionate Love, who when we were Conceived and Born in
Sin Ps. 51. 5.
, of sinful Parents; when we sprang from a Root wholly corrupt, and were all
Children of Wrath Ephesians. 2. 1.
have in our Baptism made us Children of thy own Heavenly Father, by Adoption
and Grace Romans 8. 15.
When we were heirs of Hell, have made us Heirs of Heaven, even joint-Heirs
with thy own Self, of thy own Glory; for which with all the Powers of my Soul I
adore and love Thee.

I know O dearest Lord, Conditions required.
that I am Thine no longer than I love thee; I can no longer feel the saving
Efficacy of my Baptism, than I am faithful to the Vow I there made; 1 st.
Repentance,
no longer than I am a Penitent, no longer am I a Christian; if I name the Name
of Christ, I am to depart from Iniquity 2 Timothy 2^ 19.
. O do Thou give me the Grace of true Repentance for all my Sins, for my
original Impurity, and for all my actual Transgressions, that I may abhor and
forsake them all: Wound my Soul with a most affectionate Sorrow for all the
Injuries, and Affronts, and Dishonours I have offered to infinite Love.

Glory be to Thee, to Faith.
O most liberal Jesu, for all those exceeding great (...) Promises 2 Pet. 12. 4.
of pardon, and Grace, (...) Glory which Thou have made to us Christians in the
Sacrament of Baptism: O may I ever steadfastly believe, O may I ever
passionately love, ma, I ever firmly rely on thy Superabundant Love in all
these Promises, for which I will ever adore and love thee.

Glory be to Thee, O sweetest Love, who in my Infancy did admit me to Holy
Baptism who by thy preventing Grace, when I was a little Child, did receive
me into the Evangelical Covenant, did take me up into the Arms of Mercy Marc.
10. 16.
, and bless me. Glory be to Thee* who did early dedicate me to thy Self, to
prepossess me by thy Love, before the World should Seize and defile me.

Ah Gracious Lord, how long, how often have I polluted my self by my Sins! but
I repent, and deplore all those Pollutions, and I consecrate my self to thee
again: O Thou most reconcilable Love, pardon, and accept me, and restore me to
thy Love: O let the intensness of my future Love, not only love for the time to
come, but retrieve all the Love I have lost.

Glory be to thee, O tenderest JESU, who when by Reason of my Infancy I could
not promise to repent and believe for my self, Sureties.
did mercifully accept of the Promise of my Sureties, who promised both for
me, as Thou did accept for good to the Paralitick Mat. 8. 5.
, the charitable intention, of those that brought him to thee; and of the Faith
of the Woman of Canaan Marc. 2. 5.
, for the Cure of her Daughter; for which merciful Acceptance, All Love all
Glory be to Thee.

O my God, O my Lord, the Promise which was made by my Sureties for me, I
acknowledge that as soon as I came to a competent Age, I was bound my self to
perform, and I own and renew my Obligation: I promise O my Lord, with all the
force of my Soul to love Thee: O do Thou ever keep me true to my own Promise,
since thou art ever unalterably true to thine, for which I will ever adore and
love thee.

of the Benefits which we receive thereby.

Q. What is the outward part or Sign in the Lord's Supper?

all men.

Glory be to thee, Institution.
O Crucified Love, who at thy last Supper did ordain the Holy Eucharist, the
Sacrament and Feast of Love.

It was for the continual Remembrance of the Sacrifice of Thy Death, O blessed.
JESU, and of the Benefits we receive thereby, that Thou wast pleased to Ordain
this Sacred and awful Rite: All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

Ah Dearest Lord, How little sensible is he of thy Love in Dying for us, who
can over forget Thee!

Ah W^ is me; that ever a Sinner should forget his Savior, and yet, alas, how
prone are we to do it!

Glory be to Thee, O Gracious JESU, who to help our Memories, and to impress
thy Love deep on our Souls, have Instituted the Blessed Sacrament, and
commanded us, Do this in Remembrance of me.

O Jesu, let the propitiatory Sacrifice of thy Death which thou did offer
upon the Cross for the Sins of the whole World, and particularly for my Sins,
be ever fresh in my Remembrance.

O blessed Savior, let that mighty Salvation, thy Love has wrought for us
never slip out of my mind; but especially let my Remembrance of Thee in the
Holy Sacrament be always most lively and affecting.

O Jesu, if I love Thee truly, I shall be sure to frequent thy (...), that I
may often Remember all the wonderful Loves of my crucified Redeemer.

I know, O my Lord and my God, that a bare Remembrance of Thee is not (...), O
do Thou therefore fix in me such a Remembrance of Thee, as is suitable to the
infinite Love I am to remember: Work in me all the holy and heavenly
Affections, as become the Remembrance of a crucified Savior.

Glory be to Thee, O Adorable Jesus, who under the Outward and Visible Part,
Parts outward.
the Bread and wine, things obvious and easily prepared, both which thou have
commanded to be Received, do communicate to our souls the Mystery of Divine
Love, the Inward and Invisible Grace, thy own most blessed Body of Blood, which
are verily and indeed taken and Received by the Faithful in thy Supper: for
which, All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

O God Incarnate, Invisible.
How the bread and the Wine, unchanged in their Substance, become Thy Body and
thy Blood; After what extraordinary manner Thou, who art in Heaven, art present
throughout the whole Sacramental Action to every devout Receiver; how Thou
can give us Thy Flesh to eat, and Thy Blood to drink; How Thy Flesh is Meat
indeed, and Thy Blood is Drink indeed; how he thus catch Thy Flesh, and
drinks Thy Blood, dwells in Thee, and Thou in (...); How he shall live by
Thee, (...) be ^^ised up by Thee to Life Eternal Joh. 6. 54. etc.
, (...) by no means comprehend; but I firmly believe all Thou have said, and I
firmly rely on Thy Omnipotent Love, to make good Thy Word; for which, All Love,
all Glory be to Thee.

I believe, O Crucified Lord, Real Presence.
that the Bread which we Break in the Celebration of the Holy Mysteries, is the
Communication of Thy Body 1 Cor. 10. 16.
and the Cup of Blessing which we bless, is the Communication of thy Blood, and
that Thou do as effectually and really convei^^ thy Body and Blood to our
Souls, by the Bread and wine, as Thou did thy holy Spirit Joh. 22. 22.
by thy Breath to thy Disciples; for which, All Love, all Glory be to Thee.

Lord, What need I labor in vain, to search out the manner of thy mysterious
Presence in the Sacrament, when my Love assures me Thou art there. All the
Faithful who approach Thee with prepared Hearts, they well know thou art there,
they feel the Virtue of Divine Love going out of Thee, to heal their
Infirmities, and to inflame their Affections for which, All Love, all Glory be
to Thee.

O holy JESU, when at thy Altar I see the Bread broken, and the Wine poured
out, O teach me to discern thy Body there 1 Cor. 11. 29.
, O let those Sa^^ed and significant Actions, Create in me a most lively
Remembrance of thy Sufferings, how thy most blessed Body was Scourged, and
Wounded, and Bruised, and Tormented; how thy most precious Blood was shed, for
my sins; and set all my powers on work to Love Thee, and to celebrate thy Love
in thus Dying for me.

Glory be to Thee, O Jesu; who did institute the Holy Eucharist in both
kinds, and have Commanded both to be Received p Mat 26. 26, 27.
, Both Kinds.
both the Bread and the Wine both thy Body broken, and thy Blood shed: thy
Love, O Lord, has given me both, and both are equally significative and
productive of thy Love: I do as much thirst after the one, as I hunger after
the other, I equally want both, and it would be grievous to my Love to be
deprived of either.

Ah Lord, who is there that truly loves Thee, when Thou give him two distinct
pledges of thy Love, can be content with one only? What Lover can endure to
have one half of thy Love withheld from him? And therefore, All Love, all
Glory be to Thee for giving both.

O my LORD, and my GOD, Benefits.
do Thou so dispose my heart to be thy Guest at thy Holy Table* that I may feel
all the sweet Influences of Love Crucified, the Strengthening and Refreshing of
my Soul, as our Bodies are by the Bread and Wine: for which I will ever adore
and love Thee.

O Merciful JESU, let that immortal Food which in the Holy Eucharist Thou
vouchsafest me instill into my weak and languishing soul, new supplies of Grace,
new life, new Love, new vigor, and new Resolution, that I may never more
faint, or droop, or tire in my Duty.

O Crucified Love, raise in me fresh Ardours of Love and Consolation, that it
may be henceforth the greatest Torment I can endure, ever to offend Thee, that
it may be my greatest delight to please Thee.

O amiable Jesu, when I devoutly receive the outward elements as sure as I
receive them, I receive thee, I receive the Pledges of thy* Love, to quicken
mine; O indulge me, though but for a moment, one Beatifick Foretast of the
Deliciousness of thy Love, that in the strength of that Deliciousness I may
perseveringly love Thee.

Glory be to thee, my Lord and my God, who have how given me an Invitation to
Thy Heavenly Feast Mat. 11. 28. Luc. 14. 17.
. All Love, all Glory to be Thee.

Lord, give me Grace, that I may approach thy awful Mystery, Preparation.
with penitential Preparation, and with a Heart fully disposed to loye Thee.

O my GOD, my Judge, give me Grace, I most humbly beseech thee, Examination.
to Examine 1 Cor. 11. 28.
my whole life past, by the Rule of thy Commandments, before I presume to Eat
of that Bread, and drink of that Cup: give me Grace sadly to restect on and
deplore all my Provocations, lest coming to the Holy Eucharist impenitent and
unprepared, I Receive unworthily, and eat and drink my own Damnation.

O Thou great Searcher of Hearts, Thou know all that load of Impiety and
Guilt under which (...) lie, O help me so impartially to judge and condemn my
self, so humbly to repent, and beg pardon, that I may not be Condemned at Thy
Tribunal, when I shall appear there at the last Day, that I may be set at thy
Right Hand, amongst thy Lovers.

Lord, give me Grace to search every secret of my Heart, to leave no Sin, if
possible unrepented of; fill my Eyes full of Tears of Love, that with those
Tears I may lament all the Indignities I have offered thy Love.

But alas alas, after the most strict Examination we can make, who can number
his impieties? Who can tell how often he offends Psalm. 1^. 12.
? Lord, therefore, cleanse me from my secret Faults, which in general I
renounce and bewail.

O my GOD, Thou who alone changest the Heart, O be Thou pleased to change mine,
change my Aversion to Thee, Repentance.
into an entire Love of Thee. O give me a filial Repentance, that with a broken
and a contrite Heart I may grieve, and mourn, and Repent for all my former
Sins, and may for ever forsake them, and return to my Obedience.

Let thy Love, O my GOD, so perfectly exhaust my Soul, Amendment.
that I may for the Future, steadfastly purpose to lead a new Life, that I may
renew my Baptismal Vow, that I may hereafter live a sworn Votary to thy Love.

O Heavenly father, settle in my soul a Lively Faith-in thy Mercy through
Christ, Faith.
a steady Belief of all thy Love to Siners, and an affectionate Reliance on the
Merits and Mediation of thy Crucified Son, of my being Accepted in the Beloved
Ephesians. 1. ^.
, for whom I will ever adore and love Thee.

O my Crucified God, Thanksgiving.
Thou Sovereign Inflammative of Love, let the Remembrance of thy Death, set all
the powers of my soul on work, that I may desire, and pant after Thee Psalm. 42.
1, 2. 63. 1.
, that I may Admire, and adore Thee, that I may take Heavenly Delight in thy
gracious Presence, that with Praise and Thanksgiving, with Jubilation and
Triumph, I may receive Thee into my Heart; there I will have Love, only Love,
always Love, to entertain Thee.

Lord, when I present my self, and my Love, as all the Gift I have to offer at
thy Altar, Charity.
next to my Love to Thee, and for the sake of thy infinite Love to me, which I
there Remember, give me Grace to love my Neighbor, and to be in Charity with
all men, and to walk in Love Ephesians. 5. 2.
, as Thou have loved us, and have given thy Self for us, an Offering and a
Sacrifice to God, for a sweetsmelling savor: For which, All Love, all Glory be
to Thee.

O most Reconcilable JESU, in this Memorial of thy Sufferings, in Forgiving
I see how thou did forgive me, and did love me when I was thy Enemy O for
thy dearest Love to me, give me Love to forgive all my Enemies Mat. 61. 14. 15.
, and to be at peace with the world, as I desire to be loved, and forgiven, and
to be at peace with Thee.

All that have any way injured me, O my God, I freely forgive, for thy sake, O
do Thou also forgive them: incline them to Brotherly Charity, and let them at
last feel the Comfort of that Reconciliation. Thou did make upon the Cross,
for which I will ever adore and love Thee.

O my God, if I have wronged or injured my Neighbor, Bestoring.
O give me Grace to beg his Pardon and as I have opportunity to make him
Satisfacttion, and Restitution according to my Power.

O crucified Love, whenever I see Thee in any of thy poor Members, Hungry or
Naked or in distress Mat. 25. 35.
, Giving.
O let the Rembrance of thy Love, in Dying for me, engage me to contribute all
I can to thy relief, O may I ever be liberal in my Alms to Thee, who were so
liberal of thy inestimable Blood for me.

It is very advisable, that persons before they Communicate, should read over
the whole Communion Office, or at least the Exhortations there, which they will
find to contain very proper and plain, and excellent Instructions.

It were much to be wished, that people would make more use of their Common
Prayer Books than they do, and apply the Prayers they meet with there to their
own particular Conditions, for the Book is always at hand, and the Prayers are
most safe, and familiar, and devout; and the more they affect us in our Closet,
the more they will affect us in the Congregation; and well meaning Souls will
reap great Spiritual advantage from this Practice.

For Example, An humble poor Christian who it may be has no other Book but his
Common Prayer Book, and who intends to come to the Holy Communion, may learn to
turn the Communion-Office to his own private use, after this manner.

Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom
no secrets are hid, Prayer for the Holy Sqirit.
cleanse the thoughts of my heart by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that I
may perfectly love Thee, and worthily magnify thy Holy Name, through Christ our
Lord, Amen.

I give most humble and hearty thanks to Thee, Thanksgiving for our Redemption.
O God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the Redemption of the World
by the Death and passion of our Savior Christ, both God and man, who did
humble Himself even to the Death upon the Cross, for us miserable Sinners, who
lay in Darkness and the Shadow of Death, that He might make us the Children of
God, and exalt us to everlasting Life.

Glory be to Thee, O JESUS, our Master and only Savior, who to the end that we
should always Remember thy Exceeding great Love in thus Dying for us, and the
innumerable Benefits which by thy precious Blood-sheding Thou have obtained to
us; have instituted and ordained Holy Mysteries, as Pledges of thy Love, and
for a continual Remembrance of thy Death, to our great endless Comfort.

To Thee therefore, O blessed Savior, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, I
will give (as I am most bounden) continual thanks, I submit my self wholly to
thy holy Will and Pleasure, and will study to serve Thee in true Holiness and
Righteousness, all the days of my life.

Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things, Confession.
Judge of all men, I acknowledge and bewail my manifold Sins, etc.

I lift up my heart unto thee, O Lord, I give Thanks unto Thee, O Lord our God,
it is meet and right so to do: Praise.
it is very meet, right, and my bounden Duty, that I should at all times, and
in all places give Thanks unto Thee O LORD, holy Father Almighty, everlasting
God.

But chiefly I am bound to praise Thee, for giving thy only Son JESUS to dye
for my sins, and to rise again for my Justification.

Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the Company of Heaven, I
laud and magnify, etc.

I do not presume to come to thy Table, O merciful LORD, prayer for our
Communicating worthily.
trusting in my own Righteousness, etc.

Glory be to God on High, and on earth peace* good Will toward men: I praise
Thee, Praise.
etc.

To these, as you see Occasion, you may add many very good Prayers, short and
plain, an pertinent to your purpose, which you may collect out of the Common
Prayer, and which will much further your Devotion: such as these,

O Lord, For Fear and Love.
who never failest to help and Govern them whom Thou do bring up in Thy
steadfast Fear and Love; Keep me I beseech Thee, under the Protection of Thy
Good Providence, and make me to have a pertpetual Fear and Love of thy Holy
Name, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

O God, For Love.
who have prepared for them that love Thee, such good things as pass man's
understanding; pour into my heart such Love toward Thee, that I loving Thee
above all things, may obtain thy promises, which exceed all that I can desire,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Lord of all Power and Might, who art the Author and Giver of all good things,
Graft in my heart the Love of thy Name, increase in me true Religion, nourish
me with all Goodness, and of thy great mercy keep me in the same, through Jesus
Christ our Lord, Amen.

O Lord, For Charity
who have taught me that all my doings without Charity are nothing worth, send
thy Holy Ghost, and pour into my heart that most excellent Gift of Charity, the
very Bond of Peace and of all virtues, without which whosoever lives is
counted dead before Thee. Grant this for thy only Son Jesus Christ's sake, Amen.

Almighty God, For Imitation of Christ.
who have given thy only Son to be unto us both a Sacrifice for Sin, and also
an Example of Godly life; Give me Grace, that I may always most Thankfully
receive that His inestimable Benefit, and also daily endeavor my self to
follow the blessed steps of His most holy Life, through the same* Jesus Christ
our Lord, Amen.

[ They that are ignorant, or that cannot read, should go to their parish
Priest, or to some other discreet and learned Minister of God's Word, and
desire him to teach them their Duty in Private: and they that do thus sincerely
seek the Law at the Priest's Mouth, shall find that the Priest's lips do
preserve Knowledge, and shall not go away without a Blessing.]

To God the Father, who first loved us, and made as accepted in the Beloved; to
God the Son, who loved us, and washed us from our Sins in His own Blood; to God
the Holy Ghost, who sheds the Love of God abroad in our hearts, be all Love,
and all Glory, for time, and for Eternity, Amen.

To the poor Inhabitants within the Diocese of Bath and Wells, THOMAS their
unworthy Bishop, wishes the Knowledge and the Love of GOD.
Dearly Beloved in our LORD,
THe Chatechism truly teaches all Christians that they are not able of
themselves to do those things they have vowed in their Baptism to do, namely,
To walk in the Commandments of God, and to serve Him, without His Special
Grace, or favorable Assistance, and this they are to learn at all times to
call upon God for, by diligent Prayer.

How good and seasonable this advice is, you will all see, if you consider what
helpless and needy Creatures the very best of men are. Alas! our weakness is
very great, our wants are very many, our Dependence on God for all things all
our lives long, is entire, and absolute, and necessary, and there is no way in
the world to gain Help and Supplies from God, but by Prayer; so that it is as
easy. and as possible to preserve a natural Life without daily Bread, as a
Christian Life without daily Prayer.

It was for this Reason that our Savior Himself took a particular care, to
teach His Disciples to pray Lue. 11. 1.
: and it is for the same Reason, and in imitation of our Heavenly Master, that
I have joined these Directions for Prayer to the Catechism.

Sure I am, the Zeal I ought to have for your Salvation, can suggest to me
nothing more Conducing to the Good of your Souls, than to Exhort and Beseech
you all, of either Sex, to learn how to Pray.

This is the first general Request I shall make to you, and I am the more
earnest in it, because my own sad Experience has taught me, how strangely
ignorant common people usually are of this Duty; insomuch that some never pray
at all, pretending they were never taught, or that their memories are bad, or
that they are not Book-learn't, or that they want money to buy a Book; and by
this means they live and dye rather like Beasts than Men; nay, their Condition
is much worse than that of Beasts, for the misery of a Beast does end at death,
but the Misery of a wicked man does then begin, and will endure to all Eternity.

To prevent then as much as lies in me the Damnation of those souls which God
has committed to my Care, and to cure that lamentable Ignorance and
Forgetfulness of GOD, which is the cause of the Damnation of so very many, I do
not only incessantly pray for you my self, but I beg of you all to pray for
your selves, and I beseech you to read the following Instructions; or if you
cannot read your selves, to get some honest charitable Neighbors to read them*
often to you, that you may remember them, and God of His Great Mercy reward the
Charity of such Neighbors.

If any of you, either by your own Negligence, or by the Negligence of your
parents, or for want of Catechizing in your Parish, are wholly ignorant of your
Duty: tho it be a most shameful and dangerous thing, for (...) who calls
himself a Christian, to know nothing of Christ or Christianity; yet if you are
willing to learn, and beg pardon of God for your wilful ignorance hitherto, and
will sincerely do your endeavor to get saving Knowledge, and heartily pray to
God to assist you, you shall find, that the very Entrance of God's Word gives
light, that it gives Understanding unto the Simple Psalm. 119. 130.
.

I must warn you before hand, that corrupt Nature will be very busy in
hindering the learning of your Duty and Thoughts will arise in your mind that
the Task will be too hard and too tedious for you to undertake; but I
faithfully promise you, to impose no hard or tedious Task on you, but such as
you your selves shall confess to be very complying with your Infirmities; for
our most compassionate Savior teaches me to say no more to you than you can
bear Joh. 16. 11.
.

All I shall exhort you to, is, to learn your Catechism, which you may do by
degrees; if you learn but a line or two in a day, you will by God's Blessing,
in a very short time learn it all over, and you will rejoice, and thank God,
for the sudden and happy progress you have made.

God forbid you should ever think your selves too old to learn to serve GOD,
and to be Saved, both which are taught in the Catechism, and therefore the
Catechism is of necessity to be learned: for how can you go to heaven if you
never learned the way thither? How can you be saved if you do not know your
Savior?

It Is a great Error, to think that the Catechism was made for Children only,
for all Christians are equally concerned in those saving Truths which are there
taught; and the Doctrine delivered in the Catechism, is as proper for the
Study, and as necessary for the Salvation of a great Doctor, as of a weak
Christian or a young Child.

But you will be the more encouraged to learn your Catechism, when you see how
excellent a help it will be to prayer, for it will at the same time further
your Knowledge and your Devotion, both together; and the prayers I intend to
commend to you, are chiefly the very* Answers in the Catechism, which being
daily repeated, will be the better fixed in your memory, and you cannot imagine
any advice for Prayer can be more easy, and Familiar, than that which directs
you to turn your very Catechism into prayers.

You are by this time (I hope) satisfied, that the Duty to which I exhort you,
is no hard task; and yet I will endeavor, by God's Assistance, to make it more
easy, by putting you into an easy Method to attain it.

If you are wholly ignorant of your Catechism, let it be your first care to
learn such Ejaculations, such short prayers as these, and say them often and
heartily.

Lord have mercy upon me.

Christ have Mercy upon me.

Lord have mercy upon me.

Lord pardon all my wilful ignorance, and gross Carlesness of my Duty, for the
sake of JESUS* my Savior, Amen.

O GOD, assist me in the learning of my Duty.

Lord help me to know and to love Thee.

Lord pity me, Lord save me; Father forgive me.

Glory be to Thee, O LORD, who have hitherto spared me.

Oh that I might at last learn to glorify, and love, and serve Thee!

Such short Prayers as these you may easily get by heart, and the method in
which I advise you to proceed, is, that in which Children are commonly taught,
in regard I am now to look on you as a Child: for there are two sorts of
Children; there are Children in Age, and Children in Understanding 1 Cor. 14.
20.
, and in this latter respect you are Children, and the same method, for the
most part, is proper for you, which is proper for those that are Children in
age.

I must therefore feed you with Milk, before you can be capable of strong meat
Heb. 5. 13.
, and I must look on you as Lambs of my Flock, which I am to use tenderly, and
these following Directions which I give to parents* for the training up their
Children in Piety, I do equally design for the training up of you. God of His
infinite Goodness, bless them to you both.

I exhort all you who are parents, to instill good things into your Children, as
soon as ever they begin to speak; let the first words they utter, if possible,
be these, Glory be to God. Accustom them to repeat these words on their knees,
as soon as they Rise, and when they go to bed, and often times in the day; and
let them not eat or drink, without saying, Glory be to God.

As their Speech grows more plain and easy to them, Teach them who Made, and
Redeemed, and Sanctified them, and for what End, Namely, to Glorify and to
Love GOD; and withal, teach them some of the shortest Ejaculations you can,
such as these;

Lord help me, Lord save me.

Lord have Mercy upon me.

All Love, all Glory be to God, who first loved me.

Lord keep me in Thy love.

Within a little time you may teach them the Lord's Prayer, and hear them say
it every day, Morning and Evening, on their knees, with some one or more of the
foregoing Ejaculations; and by degrees as they grow up, they will learn the
Creed, and the whole Catechism.

Be sure to teach your Children with all the sweetness and gentleness you can,
lest if you should be severe, or should overtask them, Religion should seem to
them, rather a Burden than a Blessing.

As their Knowledge increases, so let their Prayers increase* also, and teach
them as they go to turn their Catechism into Prayers, after the manner which I
shall show you, and to Confirm and improve their Knowledge, bring them duly to
the Church to be Catechized by the parish Priest, that by his familiar and
devout Explications of the Catechism, they may learn to understand it, and may
be capable of Reading the Exposition on it, and other Books of Piety.

Take conscientious Care to Season your Children as early as you can, with the
Love of GOD, which is the first and great Commandment Matthew. 22. 38.
, and with the Fear of God which is the Beginning of wisdom Psalm. 111. 10.
; for the awful Love, and the Filial Fear of God, must always go together.

The same method you take in teaching your Children, the same you may observe
in teaching your Servants, according as you see they want Teaching, and you
your selves will reap the Benefit of it, as well as your servants; for the more
devout Servants they are of GOD, the more ^aithful Servants will they be to you.

Remember, You must teach both your Children and Servants by your Example, as
well as by your Instruction, for they learn best by Example; and if they see
you give an example of Fraud, or Lying, of Revenge or Calumny, of Uncleanness
or Drunkenness, of Cursing and Swearing and Irreligion; instead of teaching
them to obey God, you teach them to Provoke Him; instead of Teaching them to
honor God, you teach them to Blaspheme Him; instead of leading them the way to
Heaven, you lead them the way to Hell; and you will increase your own
Damnation, by furthering theirs, which God forbid you should ever do.

Now that you may the better give a good Example to your Family, I will by Gods
help give you a Method of Daily Devotion, taken for the most part out of the
Catechism, which will be suitable to all Christians, be they never so well
instructed, and which you may by little and little teach your childrens, and
which those who have been bred up in Ignorance, and are Children in
Understanding, and yet willing to be taught, may learn to say also, as the
capacities of either do increase; for a Christian must never stand at a stay,
but must be always growing in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet. 3. 18.
.

A Method of Daily PRAYER.
As soon as ever you awake, offer your first thoughts and Words to God, saying

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: Three Persons
and one God, blessed for evermore; All Love, all ^^aise be to Thee.

As you are Rising, say
I laid me down and slept, and role up again; for the Lord sustained me Psalm.
3. 5.
: All Love, all Glory be to God.

As soon as you are Dressed, kneel down, as our Savior Himself kneeled, Luc. 22.
41.
at his Prayers, and remember you are in God's Presence, and say your Prayers
with Reverence and Devotion.

Morning Prayer.
Glory be to Thee, O Lord GOD, for my Preservation and Refreshment, and for all
the Blessings of the Night past, for which, All Love, all Praise be to Thee.

Father, Forgive me all the Evil of the Night past, for the Merits of JESUS my
Savior, Amen.

O Merciful God, keep and protect, and bless me this day, and prosper me in my
Calling, and preserve me from Sin and Danger, for the Merits of Jesus my
Savior, Amen.

I Believe in GOD the Father Almighty, etc.

All Love, All Glory be to Thee, O God the Father, who have made me and all the
world.

All Love, All Glory be to thee O God the Son, who have Redeemed me, and all
Mankind.

All Love, all Glory be to Thee, O God the Holy Ghost, who do Sanctify me
and all the Elect People of God.

All Love, all Glory be to Thee, O Father of Mercy, who in my Baptism did
make me a Member of Christ, thy own Child, and an Inheritour of the Kingdom of
Heaven.

O my GOD, I do this day Dedicate my self to thy Service, and do Renew the
Promise and Vow of my Baptism:

I do from my heart Renounce the Devil and all his works, the Pomps and
Vanities of this wicked world and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh: From all
which, good LORD deliver me.

I believe all the Articles of the Christian-Faith, and I will keep Thy Holy
Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.

All this, O Lord, I am Bound to believe and do, and by thy Help so I will, and
I heartily thank Thee, O Heavenly Father, who have called me to this State of
Salvation, through (...) Christ my Savior; and I pray unto Thee to give me thy
Grace, that I may continue in the same to my lives end.

Lord hear me, help me, pardon my failings, supply all my Wants, and the Wants
of all faithful people, which I sum up in the Words of thy own beloved Son,

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

After the like manner you may pray at Night.
Evening Prayer.
Glory be to Thee, O Lord, for my Preservation, and for all the blessings of
the day past; for which, all Love, all Praise be to Thee.

Father, forgive me all the Sins I have this day committed, either in Thought,
Word or Deed, either against Thee, or against my Neighbor, for the sake of
Jesus my Savior. Amen, Amen.

It grieves me, O merciful GOD, that I should daily offend Thee; but I repent,
O pity and pardon me, for the Sake of JESUS thy beloved, Amen, Amen.

O my God, keep and protect, and bless me this Night, and preserve me from Sin
and danger, for the sake of Jesus, Amen, Amen.

LORD, refresh me this Night with seasonable Sleep, that I may rise the next
morning more fit and able to serve thee in my Calling, for the sake of Jesus
thy beloved. Amen, Amen.

I believe in GOD, the Father Almighty, etc.

All Love, all Glory be to thee, O God the Father etc. as in the morning.


I desire Thee, O Lord God, O Heavenly Father, who art the the giver of all
Goodness, to send thy Grace, unto me, ( and to my Wife and Children, to my
Husband and Children, Father and Mother, Brethren and Sisters, Kindred and
Friends Master and Mistress) and unto all people, that we may worship Thee,
serve Thee, and obey thee, you must name these Relations, acording as you stand
related.
as we ought to do: And I pray unto Thee, that thou would send us all things
that be needful both for our souls and dies, and that Thou will be merciful
unto us, and forgive us our Sins; and that it will please Thee to save and
defend us in all Dangers, ghostly and bodily, and that Thou will keep us from
all Sin and Wickedness, and from our ghostly Enemy, and from everlasting Death:
and this I trust He will do of His Mercy and Goodness, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Amen, Lord, So be it.

Lord hear me, Lord help me, pardon my Failings, supply all my wants and the
wants of all for whom I pray, which I sum up in the Words of thy own beloved
Son,

Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

As you are going to Bed, say
I will lay me down in peace and take my Rest, for it is Thou, Lord, only that
make me dwell in safety Psalm. 4. 9.


As you began the day, so end it with Glorifying God, and when you are in Bed,
say,

Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, Three Persons
and One GOD, Blessed for ever more. All Praise, all Love be to Thee.

I earnestly beg of God, to make you Sensible your selves, and to give you
Grace to make your Children and Servants sensible also, how necessary, and
happy, and Heavenly a Duty Prayer is, and how many Exceeding great and precious
Promises God has made to those that devoutly pray to Him; and if you are thus
Sensible, you will not content your selves with Morning and Evening Prayer
only, but you will be desirous, if you have Opportunity, to retire about
Midday, for a few minutes, that you may imitate the Devotion of Holy David,
and of Daniel, and pray three times a day Dan. 6. 10.
: and that you may not want a Help for Noontide Prayer, the Catechism shall
supply you.

Prayer for Noon.
At Evening, and at Morning, and at Noonday, will I pray, and that instantly,
Lord, hear my Voice Psalm. 55. 17.
.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in
the Beginning, is now, and ever shall be, World without end, Amen.

All Love, all Glory be to Thee, O God the Father, who have first loved us, and
have given thy beloved Son to die for our Sins, and to rise again for our
Justification.

Have mercy upon me O GOD, after Thy great Goodness, according to the Multitude
of Thy Mercies do away mine Offenses.

Wash me thoroughly from my Wickedness, and Cleanse me from my Sin.

Make me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me, for the sake
of Jesus thy Beloved. Amen.

O Lord God, Who see I am not able of my self to walk in thy Commandments,
and to serve Thee: be pleased to help and strengthen me by thy special Grace,
that I may daily and sincerely perform my Duty toward thee, and my Duty
toward my Neighbor, for the sake of Jesus my Savior, Amen.

O my God, give me Grace to believe in Thee, and to love Thee with all my
Heart, with all my Mind, with all my Soul, and with all my strength; to worship
Thee, to give Thee Thanks, to put my whole Trust in Thee, to call upon Thee, to
honor thy Holy Name and thy Word, and to serve Thee truly all the Days of my
Life: for the sake of JESUS thy beloved, Amen.

O my God, Give me grace to love my Neighbor as my self to do to all men, as I
would they should do to me; This clause must be left out if your Father and
Mother be dead.
to Love, Honor, and Succor my Father and Mother, to Honor and obey the King
and all that are put in Authority under Him; to submit my self to all my
Governors, Teachers, spiritual Pastors and Masters; to order my self lowly
and reverently to all my Betters; to hurt no body by Word or Deed, to be true
and just in all my Dealing; to bear no Malice nor Hatred in my heart; to keep
my hands from Picking and stealing, and my Tongue from evil-speaking, Lying,
and Slandering; to keep my body in Temperance, Soberness, and Chastity; not to
Cover or Desire other men's Goods, but to learn and labor truly to get my own
Living, and to do my Duty in that state of Life unto which it has pleased GOD
to call me, for the sake of Jesus thy Beloved, Amen.

Lord, hear me, help me, pardon my Failings, supply all my wants, which I sum
up in the Words of thy beloved Son,

Our Father which art in Heaven etc.

Instead of these two last Prayers, you may sometimes say the Ten Commandments,
which you may turn into a very good prayer, by saying after every one,

Lord have Mercy upon me, and incline my heart to keep this Law.

Where you not only beg pardon for the sins you have committed against each
Commandment, but you also beg Grace to keep it.

At the end of them you may say,

Lord have Mercy upon me, and write all these thy Laws in my heart, I beseech
Thee.

And so conlude with the Lord's Prayer.

Do not think that this practice of Prayer will be too hard, or too long for
young persons, or for laboring people; for if you cannot say them all, say as
much as you can; or if you are at day-Labour, and have not Time or Convenience
to say them, offer up to God two or three hearty Ejaculations in their place.
But if you can get time and convenience, say them all: And I dare assure you,
that all the three Forms of Prayer which I commend to you, will not in all take
up a Quarter of an hour: and certainly, that person has very little sense of
his Duty, very little concern for his immortal soul, very little Honor for
God, or value for Heaven, who will not spend one quarter of an hour in the
space of four and twenty hours, in the Service of God, and the Salvation of his
own soul.

I do by all means exhort you, to give your Servants a few minutes leisure at
noon, to pray after your Example, and to use your Children to do the same, for
they will soon be able to say the Lord's Prayer, and two or three Ejaculations,
and teach them to say these at Noon, as well as at morning and at night, and
it is incredible to think, how much good this practice will do them, and what
great comfort you your selves will reap from the early Devotion of your
Children.

To further this Devotion in your Children, instead of idle Tales, and Songs,
which pollute their souls, and when they come to be serious, will cost them
great pains to unlearn. You must teach them short Psalms by heart, which will
exercise their Memories and Piety, both together; and as you teach the Psalms
to your (...), I exhort you to learn them your selves.

You cannot imagine the great benefit of learning Psalms by heart, for when you
are under any Temptation, or are in any Affliction, or when you lie waking in
the Night, or when you are sick, these Psalms will come into your mind, and the
devout Repeating them will yield you most seasonable Consolations.

The very Common People, in the first and purest Ages of the Church, were so
sensible of the spiritual Advantages of learning Psalms, that they learned the
whole Psalter by heart, and sang or said the Psalms in their Shops and at the
plow, insomuch that St. James makes it the proper Expression of Christian-Mirth
Jam 5. 13.
, If any be merry, let him sing Psalms.

This is the way to store your own and your Childrens minds with Ejaculations,
or short Prayers for all Occasions, which I advise both Old and Young to
accustom themselves to, because it is the true way of Praying without ceasing,
and it is a kind of Prayer most easy, and may be used at any time of the day,
or in any place, and is one of the most efficacious means in the world to keep
us in Gods Favor, which is of all things most desirable.

EJACULATIONS.
At Going out, or Coming in.
Lord bless my Going out and my Coming in, from this time forth for ever more
Psalm. 121. 8.
.

Lord Grant, that whether I eat or drink, or whatever I do, I may do all to thy
Glory 1 Cor. 10. 31.

Psalm. 103. 1
.

Praise the Lord, O my soul, while I live will I praise the Lord, yea as long
as I have any being I will sing praises unto my God 146. 1.


You that have Families, I do further exhort, that besides your Private
prayers, you would offer up to God, a Morning and Evening Sacrifice in your
Families, and that every one of you would take up the Holy Resolution of
Joshua, As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord Josh. 24. 15.
, And the prayers I advise you to use, are taken out of the Common Prayer, as
being most Familiar, and of greatest Authority withal.

If any of your Family are gone abroad to their work, before the rest can be
ready, call that little Congregation about you that is at home, and you that
are present, pray for those that are absent; and by this means those that are
absent upon necessary Employments, will share in the Blessings for which you
pray.

Morning Prayer for a Family.
Let the Words of our Mouths, and the Meditations of our Hearts, be always
acceptable in thy Sight: O Lord, our Strength and our Redeemer.

O God, the Father of Heaven, have mercy upon us miserable Sinners.

O God the Son, Redeemer of the world, have mercy upon us miserable Sinners.

O God the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son, have mercy upon
us miserable Sinners.

O Holy, Blessed, and Glorious Trinity, Three Persons and one God, have mercy
upon us miserable Sinners,

O Lord, we beseech Thee, mercifully hear our prayers, and spare all those who
confess their sins unto thee, that they whose Consciences by Sin are accused,
by thy merciful Pardon may be absolved, through Christ our Lord, Amen.

Almighty GOD, who see that we have no power of our selves to help our
selves, we give Thee humble thanks for thy preservation of us this day past, [
or this night past] and for all the Blessings Thou daily vouchsafest us; and we
beseech Thee to keep us both outwardly in our Bodies, and inwardly in our
Souls; that we may be defended from all Adversities which may happen to the
Body, and from all evil Thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul, through
JESUS Christ our Lord, Amen.

Almighty God, whose Kingdom is everlasting and Power infinite, have Mercy upon
the whole Church, and so rule the Heart of thy chosen Servant JAMES our King
and Governor, that He (knowing whose Minister He is) may above all things seek
thy Honor and Glory; and that we, and all his Subjects (duly considering whose
Authority He has) may faithfully serve, honor, and humbly obey Him, in Thee,
and for Thee, according to Thy blessed Word and Ordinance, through Jesus Christ
our Lord, who lives and reigns ever One GOD, world without end, Amen.

Unto thy Gracious Mercy and Protection O LORD, do we Commit our selves this
day, or this Night.
and all our Relations and Friends, Lord, prosper us in our Callings; Lord
bless us and keep us; Lord, make thy Face to shine upon us, and be gracious
unto us; Lord lift up thy Countenance upon us and give us peace, both now and
ever more, for the sake of Jesus thy beloved, in whose own blessed Words, we
sum up all our wants.

Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

The same Form, changing but one word, is proper for the Night as well as the
morning, to make Family prayer the more easy to you.

That prayer which I have set down, wherein you pray for the King, and pray for
your selves also, that you may be good Subjects, I exhort you never to omit,
because you know that the Country wherein you live, was the only seat of the
late Rebellion, and the Tares of Sedition, have been industriously sown among
you, and you have the greater reason to pray that you may continue firm in your
Allegiance; besides, St. Paul teaches you that to pray for Kings is good and
acceptable in the sight of GOD our Savior. 1 Timothy 2. 2, 3.


To your Family Prayers, you may add, as you see occasion; are of these
following:

Almighty and everlasting God, give unto us the Increase of Faith, Hope, and
Charity, and that we may obtain that which Thou do promise, make us to love
that which Thou do command, thre^ (...) JESUS Christ our Lord, Amen.

Lord we beseech Thee, grant thy people grace to withstand the Temptations of
the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and with pure hearts and minds to follow
Thee the only GOD, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

^^^vent us, O Lord, in all our Doings with thy most gracious Favor, and
further us with thy continual help, that in all our works begun, continued, and
ended in Thee, we may Glorify thy Holy Name; and finally, by thy mercy obtain
everlasting Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

These and the like short Prayers may be said alone in the Closet, as well as
in the Family, by changing only the number, and for [we] saying all along [I]
and for [us] saying [me.] As for example, when you read any part of the Holy
Scripture, either alone by your selves, or with your Families; both which you
should do daily, if you have leisure, but if you have not, see that you do both
on the Lord's days, and on Holy Days, and before Reading say this Prayer,

Blessed Lord, who have caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our
learning grant that we [ I] may in such wife hear them, read, mark, learn, and
inwardly digest them, that by patience, and comfort of thy holy Word, we [ I]
may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting Life, which Thou
have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

God of His infinite mercy, bless these Instructions to His Glory, and to the
furtherance of your Devotions, through JESUS the beloved: Amen, Amen.
