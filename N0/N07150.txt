A DIALOGUE, etc.
Lorenzo, Eugenio, Amyntor. LORENZO. ENOUGH, ye Sons of SCIENCE! Honors meet
At your maternal Shrine have now been paid.
From the fair Fount of HELICON divine
Pure living Streams enraptured have ye drawn
Of Classic Lore, and bade them copious flow
To grace the Prospects of this festive Day,
Meanwhile each Patriot Eye with Transport gazed;
Each Friend of Worth, of Science and of Man
With chearing Smiles their silent Plaudit gave.
SAY then, my Friends, have ye no Chaplets weaved,
No jocund Song prepared, of sprightliest Strain,
To crown the Labors of the learned Tribe,
And sooth with Warblings sweet the parting Ear?

EUGENIO. YES, my LORENZO! grateful will we pay
All seemly Tribute to this glad Occasion:
Nor Chaplets gay, nor Song of sprightliest Strain
Will we refuse. See good AMYNTOR's Eye
Sparkles with Joy, and speaks some rapturous Theme.

AMYNTOR. WHAT Theme more joyous, or can better suit
The glad Return of this auspicious Day,
Than that which occupies my present Thought,
And which the faithful Index of my Heart
Pointed to thy Discerning. Know, EUGENIO,
The Joy, that sports in thy AMYNTOR's Breast
And over his Visage spreads this placid Smile,
Springs from no other Source than the loud Fame
Of his young Monarch's Worth. Be this our Theme.

EUGENIO. AND is it thus, AMYNTOR? Ah! how soon
To Sounds of Grief succeeds the Voice of Joy,
And gilded Trappings to the Garb of Woe!
Far other Scenes thy laboring Breast disclosed,
When last I met Thee at these annual Rites,
With Visage wan, with dark and downward Brow;
When royal Dust received the duteous Tear,
When trembled with the Dirge this stately Dome,
And gloom'd these hallowed Walls with Wreaths funereal.

AMYNTOR. O name it not, my Friend! all custom'd Dues
To Majesty entombed were then discharged.
To dwell desponding on the mournful Theme,
Or hang like Statues over the kingly Urn
Pale, motionless as Marble, this were impious,
A Censure weak and rash of Heaven's Decree.
Shout then, ye favored Race, ye Sons of Freedom!
Bound every Heart with Joy, and every Breast
^our the warm Tribute of a grateful Praise!
For over the Realms of BRITAIN reigns supreme,
The Darling of his People, GEORGE the GOOD.
Bright-clustring round his Throne the Virtues stand
In meet Array, obsequious, at his Call,
To fly, triumphant, through his wide Domain,
And deal their salutary Influence round.

LORENZO. THRICE happy Monarch! skilled in every Art
To win a Nation's smile and fix their Love.
Thy youthful Blossoms are the Earnests sure
Of future Glories to thy native Land.
Hence, in the mighty Rolls of British Fame,
Thy Reign shall shine distinguished from the Rest
By Deeds of Valor, Piety and Love.

AMYNTOR, NOR only in the Sphere of Royalty,
The wise Exertions of his kingly Power,
Does GEORGE illustrious move: each milder Virtue,
Each soft endearing Scene of private Life
His tender Soul embraces; modest Worth,
Grace unaffected, true Simplicity
With Dignity combined, each nameless Joy
That HYMEN twines around his silken Bands,
He meets with Transport in his CHARLOTTE's Arms,
The pleasing Partner of his Heart and Throne.
But let us not in fond and growing Parley
Thus waste the Day. -- Begin, ye Choral Band,
For whom the festive Song has been prepared,
And with loud Poeans rend the vaulted Roof.

ODE.
BRIGHT ascending in the Skies
See BRITANNIA's Glory rise!
Cease your Sorrows, cease your Fears!
Night recedes and Day appears!
Another GEORGE majestic fills the Throne,
And glad BRITANNIA calls him all her own.
CHORUS.
LET the tuneful Chorus join
And high their Voices raise,
To celebrate in Notes divine
The youthful Monarch's Praise.
II.
REJOICING SCIENCE, with each polished Art,
Beneath his Reign shall with Success conspire
To form the Manners, humanize the Heart,
And virtuous Thoughts, and virtuous Deeds inspire.
The Sweets of Liberty shall care beguile,
And Justice still her happy Influence spread,
Religion cheer him with a sacred Smile,
And bid the Crown sit gently on his Head.
CHORUS.
LET the tuneful Chorus join
And high their Voices raise,
To celebrate in Notes divine
The pious Monarch's Praise.
III
SEE resplendent at his Side
Sits his modest blooming Bride!
Glowing Youth and Beauty join
To make the Fair conspicuous shine:
Every Virtue warms her Breast --
How is BRITAIN's Monarch blessed!
Unsullied Bliss shall crown the royal Pair,
The Good and Great are Heaven's peculiar Care.
CHORUS.
LET the tuneful Chorus join,
And high their Voices raise,
To celebrate in Notes divine
The happy Monarch's Praise.
IV
ROUGH War shall humbly at his Feet
Her bloody Laurels lay;
Him gentle Peace shall kindly greet
And smile beneath his Sway.
Then BRITAIN! hail these golden Days!
Illustrious shall thou shine:
For GEORGE shall gain immortal Praise;
And, BRITAIN! GEORGE is thine.
To distant Times he shall extend thy Name,
And give thy Glories to a deathless Fame.
CHORUS.
LET the tuneful Chorus join,
And high their Voices raise,
To celebrate in Notes divine
The BRITISH MONARCH's Praise.
