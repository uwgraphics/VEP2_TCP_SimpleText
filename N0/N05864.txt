The Lawer's Pedigree,
Tune, Our Polly is a (...) Slut.
A Beggar had a Beadle,
A Beadle had a Yeoman;
A Yeoman had a prentice,
A prentice had a Freeman:
A Freeman had a Master,
The Master had a Lease;
The Lease made him a Gentleman,
And Justice of the peace.
The Justice being rich,
And gallant in Desire,
He married with a Lady,
And so he had a Squire:
The Spuire had a Knight
Of Courage bold and stout;
The Knight he had a Lord,
And so it came about.
The Lord he had an Earl;
His Country he forsook,
He traveled into Spain,
And there he had a Duke:
The Duke he had a prince,
The prince a King of Hope
The King he had an Emperor
The Emperor a Pope.
Thus, as the Story says,
The pedigree did run;
The Pope he had a Friar,
The Friar had a Nun:
The Nun, she was with Child
And so her Credit sunk
The Father was a Friar,
The Issue was a Monk.
The Monk he had a Son,
With whom he did inhabit,
Who when the Father died,
The Son became Lord Abbot:
Lord Abbot had a Maid,
And caught her in the Dark,
And something did to her,
And so he had a Clerk.
The Clerk he had a Sexton,
The sexton had a Digger;
The Digger had a Prebend,
The Prebend had a Vicar;
The Vicar had an Attorney,
The which he took in Snuff;
The Attorney had a Barrister,
The Barrister a Ruff.
The Ruff did get good Counsel,
Good Counsel get a Fee,
the Fee did get a Motion
That it might Pleaded be:
the Motion got a Judgment,
And so it came to pass,
A Beggar's Brat, a scolding Knave,
A crafty Lawyer was.
