June, 29. 1680. The Church Renewed COVENANT, as follows.
WE, who through the exceeding Riches of the Grace and Patience of God, do
continue to be a Church of Christ, being now Assembled in the Holy Presence of
God, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

After humble Confession of our manifold Breaches of the Covenant before the
Lord our God, and earnest Supplication for pardoning Mercy through the Blood of
Christ, and deep Acknowledgement of our great Unworthiness to be Owned to be
the Lord's Vovenant People; also Acknowledging our own Inability to keep
Covenant with God, or to perform any Spiritual Duty, unless the Lord Jesus do
enable us thereto by his Spirit dwelling in us; And being awfully sensible that
it is a dreadful Thing for sinful Dust and Ashes personally to transact with
the Infinitely glorious Majesty of Heaven and Earth; We do in humble Confidence
of his gracious Assistance and Acceptance through Christ, each one of us for
our Selves, and Jointly as a Church of the living God, Explicitly Renew our
Covenant with God, and one with another, in manner and Form following. i. e.

We do give up our selves to that God whose Name alone is JEHOVAH, Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, the One only True and Living God, and to our blessed Lord
Jesus Christ, as our only Blessed Savior, Prophet, Priest, and King over our
Souls, and Only Mediator of the Covenant of Grace, Promising (by the Help of
his Spirit and Grace) to cleave unto God as our Chief Good, and to the Lord
Jesus Christ by Faith and Gospel-Obedience, as becomes his Vovenant People,
for ever. We do also give up our Offspring to God in Jesus Christ, Avouching
the Lord to be Our God, and the God of our Children, and our selves with our
Children to be His People; humbly adoring the Grace of God, that we and our
Offspring with us may be looked upon to be the Lord's.

We do also give up our selves one to another in the Lord, and according to
the will of God; freely covenanting and binding our selves to walk together as
a right ordered Congregation and Church of Christ, in all the ways of His
Worship, according to the holy Rules of the Word of God, promising in Brotherly
Love to watch over one another Souls faithfully, and to submit our selves to
the Discipline and Government of Christ in his Church, and duly to attend all
those Ordinances, which Christ has Instituted in his Church and commanded to
be attended by his People, according to the Order of the Gospel, and degrees of
Communion unto which we have attained, Not resting in measures attained; but
pressing after all. And whereas the Messengers of these Churches, who have met
together in the Name of Christ, to enquire into the Reason of God's Controversy
with this People, have taken Notice of many Provoking Evils and procuring
Causes of the Judgments of God upon New England; So far as we, or any of us
have been guilty of provoking God by any Sin therein discovered to us, We
desire from our hearts to bewail it before the Lord, and humbly to entreat for
Pardoning Mercy, for the sake of the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant. And as
an Expedient to Reformation of those Evils, or whatsoever else have provoked
the Eyes of God's Glory among us, We do freely engage and promise, as in the
Presence of God,

First, That we will (Christ helping) endeavor every one of us to reform our
Heart and Life, by seeking to mortify all our Sins, and laboring to walk more
closely with God than ever yet we have done; and will continue to worship God
in Public, Private, Secret; and this without Formality or Hypocrisy: and more
fully and faithfully than heretofore, to discharge all Covenant-Dutyes one to
another in Church Communion.

Secondly, To walk before God in our Houses with a perfect Heart, and that we
will uphold the Worship of God therein continually, according as He in his
Word does require; both in respect of Prayer, and reading the Scriptures, that
so the Word of God may dwell richly in us: And will do what in us lies, to
bring up our Children for Christ, that they may be such, as they that have the
Lord's Name put upon them by a solemn Dedication to God in Christ, ought to be.
And will therefore (as need shall be) Catechize, Exhort, and Charge them to
Fear the Lord; and endeavor to set an holy Example before them, and be much in
Prayer for their Conversion and Salvation.

Thirdly, To endeavor to be pure from the Sins of the Times, especially those
Sins, which have been by the late Synod solemnly declared and evidenced to be
the Evils that have brought the Judgments of God upon New England; and in our
places to endeavor the suppression thereof, and be careful so to walk as that
we may not give Occasion to others to sin, or speak evil of our holy Profession.

Now, that we may observe and keep this sacred Covenant, and all the Branches
of it, Inviolable for ever, We desire to deny our selves; and depend wholly
upon the Power of the Eternal Spirit of Grace, on the Free Mercy of God, and
Merit of Christ Jesus: And where we shall fail, there to wait upon the Lord
Jesus for Pardon, Acceptance, and Healing for His Name's sake.

Soli Deo Gloria.
