TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FREEMEN Of This PROVINCE of PENNSILVANIA And
Counties Annexed, In Assembly Convened at Philadelphia the 10th of the 3d
Month, 1692.
THe great and main end of publishing the promulgated Bills so long before your
Convention, being (as we are sensible) in order to our Perusal, that we may
thereupon have a full Opportunity of Conferring with and Communicating our
Minds freely to you (our Deputies or Delegates (of whom we have made Choice,
for the Preservation of our Liberties and Properties) touching our Approbation
or Dislike of any or all the said Bills. And because of the Difficulty to
procure, as well as many Inconveniences that attend a Transient Discourse or
Verbal Conference, we have made choice of communicating our Sense and Mind to
you by this way and manner, hoping we shall not need to doubt, but you will
readily endeavor to gratify the honest Desires, and answer the just Requests
of those, whose Choice you are, by whose Power you Act, and with whose
Liberties you are Entrusted.

The Thing therefore, touching which we at present give you the (...) of these
Lines, is a certain Bil, promulgated for the Assessing and Leavying One Penny
per Pound out of the supposed Vain of every Man's Estate, either Real or
Personal, and Two Shillings per Head for those not otherwise Rated; which Great
TAX, as it will doubtless amount to a great Sum of Money, for which we know no
present Necessity, (...) is there any particularly alleged in the said Bill;
so the deep Impression it will make in our Estates, much of which (as to diverse
of us) (...) dead ^n Lands of (...) or profit at present, though liable to be
highly Rated at the Wills and Pleasure of the Promulgators themselves (and
others also, who are Traders in Merchandise, being liable to considerable
Losses, by reason of the great (...) and Hazards of these Perilous Times (as
some have deeply felt) besides the many other ill Consequences thereof, as the
ill foundation it lays for a succeeding Governor, of which you are not
insensible) is very grievous, and greatly discouraging to us; and as it may
almost Ruin many at present, who having little besides Land, whereon they can
scarcely get their Maintenance, and being highly Taxed, may have neither Corn
nor Money to defray the same, as well as those others among us, who are
uncertain whether we have really any thing of our own, or not; so will you
find, that if you once Confirm the said Bill, it will be very Prejudicial and
Detremental to the Freemen (who are the Kings Subjects) both of this Province
and Counties annexed, in time to come; for the thing once past, will not easily
be Recalled; Besides also, you will find it, (as well as our selves) of
dangerous Consequence, and an ill President for the future, for as the People
grow in Wealth, and Governors in Power, so shall the Tax be laid Heavier.

And 2 dly. If it be so heavy, and grievous, when there is no Necessity
therefore, (as we are sensible of at present) what may we expect will come on
us, when there is any Color or Pretense of a Necessity indeed? And though the
annexed Counties may suppose they shall not touch this heavy and grievous
Burden with one of their Fingers, let them assure themselves, that if ever
they and we be again as formerly, they will Unavoidably taste of the same
bitter Cup.

Consider these things, we desire you, as the Agrievance of the Freemen, by
Virtue of whose Love, Trust and Confidence, you are what you are at this Time;
neither Argue nor Dispute, for Arguments sake, against the Validity of the
Arguments herein used, but let them find that Entertainment and Regard with
you, as becomes true and faithful Trustees, who intend to answer the end of
their Election and Electors, by keeping their Country free from Bondage and
Slavery, and avoiding such Ill Methods as may render Themselves and Posterity
liable thereto; for, in short, as we said before, we are not sensible of any
present Necessity for (...) Money on this account, especially since (if our
Neighboring Counties (...) our Condition) the Province is more Indebted
already than they are easily capable of paying, both for Quit-Rents, and upon
other Public Accounts, and much more is Needful, in order to Public
Buildings, as Prison, Market and Court-Houses, with other Public Things,
unavoidably Requisite, t^ defraying which Ch^rge, we understand not the present
Tax to be any ways intended; And since you well know how little a Time Things
have been on the Foot they now are, how long will be their Continuance on the
same, is Uncertain (although we may well conclude of no very long Continuance,
from the Deputy Governors own words, which diverse of us heard him express at
the Publication of his Commission, [ That he Hoped it would not be Long] which
[Hope] doubtless he had some just ground for) and seeing nothing is more
Certain, than that no great Charges can have accrew'd in this little M^nute of
Time, therefore be Wary and Cautious: Remember, an ill Foundation is more than
half a degree of to an ill Structure: And think not amiss, because (...) plain
with you, (...) that it consists not with your Dignity or Honor to regard the
Will and (...) of those who have, through great Confidence in your Wisdom and
(...) entrusted their Lives, Liberties and Estates in your Hands, especially
^^^ce they presume no farther than becomes honest Freemen, speaking only what
Necessity, and the Care of their Posterity compells them to, and That, which
being longer delayed, might come too late, and be said in vain; which we once
more hope you will well consider, and answer our Expectations accordingly, by
Refusing the Passing of the aforesaid Bill.
