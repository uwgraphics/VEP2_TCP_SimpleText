An Abstract of A LETTER TO Cotton Mather Of Boston in NEW ENGLAND

By T M.

Printed in the Year 1701.

To The Reader.
THey who have occasioned the following matter, with an abstract of wh^t ha^h
been written by T. M to Cotton Mather, are like spirited to those Beasts, with
which Paul ^ought at Ephesus, against which sort of da^k evil^ c^eatures* no
spiritual Weapon can be ^oo sharp; for their Tongues, to which they have no
b^idle, manifest their Religion vain* and themselves to be great Persecutors,
who are led by that pernicious, spirit which the rebellious Jews were, unto
Christ whom said, Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father
ye will do; the which airy spirit, in the likeness of the Serpent, betrayed
Adam into the fall, and moved Cain to slay his Brother Abel for that he was
righteous, and his offering accepted of God; even so it has been in every Age,
he that is born after the flesh persecuteth him that is born after the spirit,
and will so continue the time o^ the Devils being loo^e, whose Temptations are
suffered for the trial of faith* that none may assume any thing to themselves
by or from their own strength, but to depend upon God, who saves them that are
obedient to the light, by his Grace through faith in Christ, who is the true
light, that lights every man that comes in (...) the world, and has warned
the Children of light, to be ware of false Prophets, which come in sheeps
clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves, and by their fruits men may know
them* which are manifest by their prey upon the sheep, who, so long as they
yield their fleece to the idle shepherd, there is peace wi^h him on every side,
but when any come to see his deceit, and with hold the fleece from him, then
they touch his greedy belly, which c^u^eth him to make open wa^, and Wol^-like,
will have the fleece by force, which is of the same nature, as was the work of
the first two wicked Priests, to wit, Elies Sons, who sent (...) raw flesh from
the people that sacrifised unto God, which since that time by d^grees, their
bellies are grown to that bigness that live Oxen* Cows and other Creat^res,
will (...) satisfy their Wol^ like bloody nature, without the (...), ^lesh,
and Blood withal, which sufficiently appears by what they have done, and
would still do, had they power, who^e hands being bound, and Tongues at
liberty, they with the help of him whom they serve* contrive horrid Lies
against those whom the Lord has made instruments of his Truth, to open the
door of Light by which the people that are not ^oo obstinate and rebellious, by
which they wholly harden and blind their understandings, may see the deceit of
all false Teachers, who run when the Lord does not send, preaching P^ace to the
people in their sins, and prophesying Lies in his (...), but in the Light of
the Lord are as much discovered in this latter Age, as in any age of the World,
which causes them to make a great stir, as ^icah who followed the Children of
Da^ for taking away his Idol God, ^udg. 18 but the Lord will more and more
strengthen the hands of the righteous, with spiritual Weapons, which will be
too sharp, with the power of God, for the opposers of his truth to with ^a^d,
who for the sake of filthy (...), Balaam-like, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness fa^sly accus^ the Children o^ the Light, merely (...) blot out
the names of the ^^ghteous, and to abolish the Light ^o^ever* whenas it is the
path of the Just that sh^^^th more and more until the perfect day, but is the
condemnation of the D^sobedient who hate the Light because i^ rep^oveth them
for their evil deeds, John 3.19 20.21. therefore they ca^l the Light Darkn^ss,
the Relique^ of old Adam, the che^ks ^f a natural C^nscience, and a stinking
Vapor from Hell, with much more of the same nature, refusing the ^^nd^rs of
Gods Grace by it, that is the Reproo^s of instruct^^^ which are the way to
(...) everlasting, for which cause of their great (...) against the Truth, and
the Professors of it; they (...) with, a^^er the manner of the H. Prophets
dealing (...) ^he Priests in their day and Christ and his Apostles in the day
(...) outward appearance to the wicked rebellious Jews, and their blind
Priests, (...) is, to vindicate and maintain the Truth with sh^rp rebuke
against their unrigh^eous ways, who as the Jews did deny the outward appearance
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, even so do the unbelieving Priests in
this day, deny his inward appearance of the Light and W^rd of his Spirit in his
people to be the true and living way to everlasting happiness; and that there
is no freedom from all sin in this life, then there is no freedom from the
Devils Power in this li^e; for all sin is of Unrighteousness, and all
Unrighteousness is of the Devil; so he that commits sin is a servant of sin,
which is of the Devil, who stirs up his servants to seek the Lives and
E^tates of the righteous, that endeavor with the help of God to open the way
of Truth* by which the chief stu^ of the persecuting Priests may be removed*
that is, that men should obey the Light which shows to them the evil of their
ways, and forsake all that is not well pleasing to God, who will assist and
preserve them in the we^l doing, by which they shall grow in Grace from one
degree to another until Grace ha^h made a perfect work of freeing them from all
Sin in this Life, which Doctrine is to inconsistent with the Priests Trade*
that where they have power, is as much as Li^e and Estate of them (...) hold
fast to maintain the Truth, but their mouths (...) stopped wi^h sharp Rebuke*
which to perform the holy Scriptu^es are ex^ant, with which and the divine
a^sistance of (...) Power therein, will in time, stop the mouths of all the
wicked gain sayers of the Truth o^ God, and L^ght of Christ (...), whose
followers with and by him shall have the victory, and many by the L^ght as Paul
was, shall be turned from Darkn^^s to Light, which Light turns pe^ples minds
from the (...) of Satan, to serve the God of all L^g^t in Truth and
Righteousness; for God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all, and they
that walk in the Light, as he is in the L^ght have fellowship one with another,
and the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses them from all sin, 1 John 1.5, 6 7. for
h^s people are led by the Light to know him, of whom Moses and the Prophets
prophesied, should come to make an end of all sin, and finish Transgressions,
and bring in everlast^ng Righteousness, that his People who l^v^ in the Light,
and obedience to the gift of his Spirit, may be made Perfect even as their
father which is in Heaven is perfect, and for this very cause of their
maintaining the Light of the Spirit of all Truth, to be the way from old Adam
to God again, are they hated and reviled, as has been in every Age, by a
company of persecuting Priests, who in every Age, as by the record of holy
Scripture, and other true Histories, have destroyed the Lives and Estates of
the Lords People, killing his Prophets and holy Priests, until the Lord of Life
himself appeared in a body of flesh to do the will of his Father, whom the
wicked Jews, with the help of the Devil, and their wicked rebellious Priests*
slew also; but the Lord will strech forth his hand, against (...) Rebelious,
whose sin is as witchcraft and cut of the ^ame o^ the Chemarims, with the
persecuting Priests, upon whom he w^ll charge ^ll the righteous Blood shed upon
the earth, a part of which has defiled New England, and will not be purged
while the evil one abides in Cotton Mather, and such like spirited Priests as
he is, who wit^ ^is Tongue manifests what his hands would do, had he but
Power, which is the same Spirit with that in his ancient Brethren in iniqui^y,
who were suffered to f^ame their mischief by a Law, as the Jews did to destroy
all the Children of Light from off the Earth, as is more at large in the
following abstract to Cotton Mather, who to render Thomas Maule and his friends
odious, has c^ntrived a parcel of horrid lies against both the Truth and them,
with which lies he has stuffed his Pamphlets, and to prom^^e his lying T^ade
are carried about in Pedlers bags from Town to Town, th^reby to produ^^ Money
for Lies throughout the Country, and more esp^cially in Taverns and Alehouses,
where airy minded people resort to spend their Time and Money, and with all
desirous to hear some new thing of airy lying ma^ter from Cotton Mather, or
such ^ike as he is, whose studies are so full of other men's Lines, from which
they collect their ma^ter, and add^ng the^eto whatever the evil one infuseth
into them against the Light, that sh^ws unto men the very thoughts of their
heart, and intentions of their mind, and condemns f^r all that is evil* and
Justifies for all that is good, Joh. 1.8, 9 chap. ^.19, 20. Rom 1 19 1 Cor. 12
7. 1 John 1.7. B^t Cotton Mather and the like spirited as he is, rather than
the Light shall receive place against their airy Trade, which fills peoples
h^ads and darkens their understandings and helps to empty their Purs^s, will
either omit the foresaid Scriptures or rest them to their own Destructions* and
proceed with L^es against the Truth, and the Professors of it, as Cotton Mather
has done against said Maule and his Friends in derision called Quakers, as in
his ^a^e Pamphlet of the Indian ^ar, merely to abuse, like unto the ways that
ever the Adversaries of Truth have used a^a^nst the witnesses of it, which to
collect the whole, would make a Volum of fal^e Doctr^nes, horid L^es, and
^ailing Accusations to exceed what many men can spear to purchase or find time
to read, for which cause I shall mention at this, time as follows.

First, That said M^^her has set forth the Lives of some ^f the chief
persecuting Priests to be holy, when as their ^ersecuting the Lord ^ervants,
and Messengers of his Tru^^ to death, manifes^eth the contrary; the which
manifests Cotton Mathers notorious Lies.

Secondly, The said M^ther charge ^he Quakers with poisoning the souls of the
People in the (...) and ou^ sk^^s of the Province, in the very places where the
Bodies and Estate^ of the people have presently after been devoured by the
Salvages. A horrid and per^ideous Lie, well known so to be, as i^ the other,
and shall so stand till he prove the contrary, which he can never do.

Thirdly, That (...) Tom. Malt at this time living in Salem, has expos^d
(...) the public a (...) of non sensual ^lasphem^^s and Heresi^s, wherein
(...) sets himself to defend the Indians in their Bloody (...), and Revile^ the
Country f^r defending himself against them. The which charge includes four
Lies together, which pro^^th his charge altog^ther compact with horrid Lies,
and so shall stand with the other of his per^ideous Lies until he make the
contrary appear, which all the art the Devil has, can never (...) him to do.

Fourthly, That all men who have a Body of sin, are Witches. Observe, Tho.
Maule has not so said, by which there is another Lie to Mathers account; yet
what manner of Persons are those Men, or Women in whom there is the Body of
sin? do not all sins make up one body of sin? and are not all sins of the works
of the flesh, with which the holy Apostle includes write ^craft, Gal. 5 1^,
20, 21. Surely Cotton Mather has so much work to study and contrive Lies
against said Maule and his Friends, that he does not know what himself is, but
its well for them that do, otherwise more would follow to maintain his
pe^n^icious ways, at which it is no wonder, for his master i^ (...) in bringing
him ^h^ngs from an invisible world, as in his Pamphlet of the Invisible World*
which by his work against the true Light, and the professors of it, does
manifest his Invisible World, to be the World of Darkness, otherwise his work
would not he altogether dark, ^s in his Pamphlet about Witches and Witchcraft,
which to follow his dark method, (...) no other then to fo^low the Devil, which
turned informer against them accused for Witches, which if Cotton Mather be as
clear of, as they put to (...) for Witch^^ were, ^t is (...) with (...), then
its thought it is* however it is so ^ad, that (...) mu^t end^re sharp Reproof,
until he have a bridle to command his unruly Tongue, which all the Tongues that
plead for ^is unrigh^^ou^ way, against (...) and his Friends, cannot set him
free from all the (...) flesh, of which Witchcraft is, as in the holy
Scripture, included.

And again he says. That (...) said M^ules Book came forth, (...) of it might
be the more improved unto the hight of (...) Wickedness, there has been
another, added with a parcel of Ingred^^nts compounded for mischief, as if by
the art of the Apotheca^^ and none but he whom the J^ws in their Talm^d call^,
(...) could have inspired such a Slander. Observe, This black Chemarim, which
regards not what he says, to call that (...) Slander, that is verbatim, as
in their own Law Book, and Court Records, but he that will call that Book a
Slander, has his tongue at liberty, to abu^e the Author at any rate, who
collected their Bloody Laws, and the work of the wicked done thereby, the
Author of which Truths contained in said Book, is a Lover of Truth, and hater
o^ all Evil, known by the name of him, who has now to do with Cotton Mather,
who with the rest of his Lies, says, That said Maule is a Liar of the first
Magnitude, when as he never proved one Lie against him; however, as to that I
shall leave, to more then twelve hundred persons of this Province, besides
elsewhere, as by his Book accounts, to speak for him, who was never known to
receive more then his own, as the wicked persecuting Priests have done, which
to enrich themselves have Ruined many* both in Li^e and Estates, which surely
if Maule were a Liar, he would not stick to take interest for his Money, which
he might often have had both upon Bill, Bond and Morgage, which for the sake of
the Truth, though lawful in some cases, yet not expedient for him to do. And
with all (...)* ^ould have the Qua^ers to censure said (...) for holding with
in his Book, of thirty and eight Chapters of Truth (...) maintained, That the
Devil, Sin, ^eath and Hell are a Nonentity, for God never created them*
Observe, This blind Priest who can see into men's Purses, and not see the Truth*
that God made all things that was made good, but the Devil, Sin, Death and Hell
were never good, neither will they ^ver be good, therefore they have no being
by creation; but a D^vil there is otherwise Cotton Mather could no^ con^rive
his Lies against said Maule and his Friends. But perhaps (says he) that Mau^e
would not ^^ick a^ the villainy to (...) upon their baptism* See what thoughts
the wicked have o^ them, against whom they can nothing of evil J^stly change,
but if said Maule had the opportunity o^ depriving one of ^ew-Englands chief
Priests of his no^es, thereby preventing him of his (...) to the People ^or
that day is no ^acriledge or crime wo^thy of bl^me likewise to mix^ the wa^er
after the manner of the Roman Church, is no sin against ^od* whose Sons and
Daughters are baptized wi^h ^he holy Ghost and F^re, having their hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and made (...) to worship the Father in the
Spirit and in the Truth, and no other (...) Worship is accepted with God, all
others (...) but men's Inventions to gather people togethe^, to (...) the (...)
Priests, who by their (...) have made ^ools of a^most the whole world, the
truth o^ which, I leave with the (...) in heart to Judge.

An Abstract from the Copy of a Letter to Cotton Mather of Boston in
New England, which is as follows.
Friend, Cotton Mather;
WHereas it does evidently appear that thou art one of that Spirit of which
christ said to them, Th^^ ye will neither enter the Kingdom of Heaven your
selves, ^e^ther suffer them that are entering to go in; by which evil work,
thou have manifested thy self a deceiver, and will further (...) so to be, by
Joining thy self in friendship with evil, against Gods people, who at the Word
of the Lord, work out their Salvation with ^ear and trembling, against whom
thou read^est evil for good, and implies thy wits to study deceit, wherewith
to hinder the People from receiving the Truth, made manifest by Jesus Christ,
for whose cause I have taken in h^nd ^o deal with thee, whose folly must be
^holly made manifest, that thereby thy L^es and false Doctrines may be
preven^ed, from receiving place in them of good de^^^e, who are enquir^ng after
the Truth* which the more to cover thy contrived L^es against Tho^as Maule, and
his friends (...) Quakers thou have (...) thy name to thy Book (...), in the
(...) of which thou desire that the Authors name may not be enquired after,
or to (...) who he is, pretending to work good thereby, without being known;
even to does (...) himself, who under pretense of doing good, works all
manner of unrighteous work against God and his People, who well know he is the
Devil, and that his Servants they are, who (as thou does) pretend good when as
^t is ev^dent by thy unrighteous Work, that evil is p^esent in thy heart, who
art well known to be one of that old persecuting (...), that persecuted to
Death the Lord-Servants at Boston, both where and elsewhere, the said Book is
sufficiently known to be thine, and that not only by the printers Name thereto,
but also by the railing method of contrived Lies therein, which in chief
against said M^ul^ and his friends, for which so doing thy M^uth must be
stopped with sharp Re^uke, and not in the least daubed over in thy evil way; or
thou have store of untempered Mortar, with which for Money thou daubest the
people in their sins, who for thy preaching daube thee up with their Money, the
love of which is the root of all evil, in all those that preach those things
which Christ has not wrought in them, who (as thou does) abide in their sins,
not expecting to be made free therefrom in this Life, where then thou young
deceiver, that loves the wages of unrighteousness, by which thy ma^ntenance is
produced? (...) not God who is righteous in all his ways, and cannot Lie, but
ac^^rding to his promise* sent a Savior to save his people from their sins, to
wit, Jesus Christ* the mediator and true light, that ligheth every man that
comes into the World, that by obedience to the gift of his grace, which
brings Salvation and has appeared to all men, that whosoever will take up
their daily c^oss in self denial, of those things which God has forbidd^^, and
live in obedience to that measu^e o^ his light, or spirit (...) them to profit
withal, shall be made free from (...) sins, and have everlasting life, but as
men continue in disobedience thereunto, it is their condemnation; (...) they
are servants of sin, they are free from righteousness* (...) also says the
holy Apostle, that while ye were (...) ye were free from righteousness, but now
ye are made free from sin, are bec^me Servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
holiness, an^ the end everlasting life, and is the very end, for which Christ
is come, to finish transgression, and make an end of sin, and make
reconciliation for ^^^quity, and bring in everlasting righteousness that his
people may be perfect even as their Father which is in Heaven is perfect, for
no imperfect thing can enter into Gods kingdom, therefore b^lieve in Christ who
has said unto them in days past that if you dye in your sins, where I go ye
cannot come, and we know that there is no Repentance to be found in the grave,
for as death leaves so Judgment finds, with much more to the same effect, will
the holy Scriptures afford, to prove that the people of G^d are by grace
through faith and obedience to the gif^ of Gods Spirit, by Jesus Christ set
free from all their sins in this Life, but if these Truths should be to thee as
pearl cast before them, that will trample them under foot and turn again and
^end, thy Condemnation will be so much the ^eares therefore receive them in
love, that they may answer the end, for which they are written, for I would that
thou should forsake the way of Bal^am, who loved the wages of unrigh^eou^ness,
and for filt^ (...) would have cursed the L^rds people, which until (...), thy
heart will not be sprinkled from an evil conscience, but will continue a
Servant to thy Master which teaches ^o make Lies thy refuge, and study
m^schief again* God^ H^ritage, whom he has chosen and fitted the^ (...) Power
from an high, to withstand the dece^vableness of S^tan* in the Instruments o^
Unrighteousness, who co^^eceive peoples Sou^s, run when the Lord has nor sent
and prophecy Lies ^n his Name, crying Peace to the people in the^r (...), but
a fearful looking for Judgment; for all sin it of Unrighteousne^s, and all
Unrighteousness is of the Devil, whose work is (...) to be favored, in any
that yield their obed^ence to serve ^im as they do that preach for hire, and
(...) Money, again such Priests was the Word of the Lord by the Prophet Isaiah
who called them* blind watch men that were ignoran^ and dumb D^gs, that could
not bark ye^ greedy dogs which (...) have enough and Shepherd^ that could not
understand, each loo^in^ (...) his own way for (...) gain from his (...); they
ar^ eve^ learning as thou art, but never (...) to come to the knowledge of the
Truth as it is in (...), whose words, with the words of the Prophets and
Apostles, which thou and all such have stolen and clo^hed themselves, like as
if they were S^eep, when (...) no other but Wolves in Sheep clothing, which as
any come to see their deceit, and can no longer f^ed their greedy desi^es,
then, as in thy Pamphlets, they prepare open Wa^ against the Lamb and his
followers, which is the very method (...) ancient Brethrens way, who to save
their backs and purses, fl^d persecution from Old England and in Ne^ England
framed their mischief by a law which they made against the Souls of ^he
R^ghteous, whose innocent B^ood they condemned for their Faith and Obedience to
God, (...) as Troo^^ of Robber^ wait for a m^n* so waited they to destroy all
those under what name soever* that could not for conscience sake join with
their dead form of will worship, pretended to God, which instead of manifest^ng
Repentance, they le^t their cruel ^loody Laws with the other de^enders of heir
Faith, of which the Gallows is chief, unto their rising Generation, of all the
which thou seem as by thy Lies against the People of God, and false
D^ctrine^ against his Truth, to be more fitted then any other I know; for the
perfideous way and cruel Bloody work of the Old Charters men's Government, in
which they deceive both King and People, and would have deceived the Elect. if
possible, but as by their works they are made manifest, eve^ so does thou
manifest thy self, in standing to maintain their unrighteou^ Cause, against the
Lords own ^^osen People, against w^om, ^hou ha^^ ^u^fered several of thy
Pamphlets, with many o^ thy own contrived ^yes, which in said Pamphlets are
(...) about in (...) bags, from Town to Town, for a Money-Trade through^u^ the
Country in which ^and there are many honest People yet in being, that well
know, how that by such Wolves in Sheeps clothing, the Nation of Old England
has been b^^rayed, to lose both their King and Privileges; for with fine
words and false hearts they made (...) Promi^es, which when they had gained the
Government and put the King to ^eath, they fell to per^ecu^e ^he people o^ God,
of which their Brethren mu^dered ^our in New England and p^r^cu^ed all others
as aforesaid all the which Wickedness to God, King and People, with much more,
enough (...) volumn, has been acted by thy ancient Brethren in (...) under the
pretense of Religion, which was their only, (...) to cover their D^ceit*
notwithstan^ing all ^as aforesaid) thou have set^orth the Lives of the chief
Priests then in New England, as if they we^e more holy then any other then in
being, save their said Brethren, the which L^es of thine and false D^ctrines
with many more when collected in one Volumn will prove thee a young d^ceive to
exc^^d what I have read, of any old ^^su^^e, Mo^^ or Fry^r of^, which if thou
do not repen^ thy trouble will be great, in that thy Condemnation will (...)
without end. And further, as I find in one of thy Pamphlets against Wolves in
Sheeps clothing as if (poor man) thou went none of that nature, who h^^h been
d^^bing with the people called Anabaptists, to (...) sin are an^ d^aw them ^o
be under thy teaching* that thereby (...) ^^ock may be inla^ged, for thee to
gain the more Fle^^e which (...) the^r g^eater encouragement thereby to attain
thy coveteous end, makes this (...) to them, That though they turn their backs
as ^fte^ (...) infant is Baptized, shall ^ut be made an offense; ^o which their
answer i^, That they look^ upon thee to be an unbaptized man, and could not
hold communion with thee.

And again what perfideous work have thou set forth, concerning New-Englands
War with the French and Ind^ans, and the life and manhood of Exploits or
valiant Acts of William Ph^ps against the French at Canada, when as both he and
all the rest turned their backs and fled homeward, with the loss (...) several
Vessels, besides their great Guns left to the French, and many hundred of men's
Lives, that as a judgment from above perished by the way, and many more in a
short time at home, the which gave the French at Canada (...) encouragement to
raise their for^^s, both of French and Indians, who before were not inflamed to
environ or compass the Inhabitants about with fire and Sword, to the destroying
o^ many hundreds peoples Lives and Estates, laying the Country waste for near
or about fifty or sixty miles together, besides the many peoples Lives and
Estates in the ou^ Towns dest^oyed, the which damage the promoters of said War
at Canada, to enrich themselves, can never be wholly repaired and made good,
with their Estates and all said Phipses Rack Money and Priests hire, which
amount to many thousands of Pounds in New England But in the mean while what is
become of all thy fa^se Prophesies, to promote said War at Canada? are they not
like unto the L^es and false Prophecies of A^abs Lying Prophets, which deceived
the people with their L^es, even as in this ^^se, and diverse other thou has
done? But what is it that thou and such as thou art will not do to get Money
and fame, (...) which thou has as great a fame to the name o^ M^ther, as
almost any late persecu^or of whom I read, which had been well for thee, and
much better for the people of New England thou had never been born, with many
more of thy Trade, and thy Father before thee, for which your names are up,
which except ye repent, your works will cause your Souls to pe^^sh for ever.

(...) also, to conclude about Canada how valiant are the actions o^ those, who
at ^ome can destroy their neighbors Lives and E^tates for their ^aith and
obedience to God, but (...) th^oughly ch^^ed by their Enemies the^ will flee,
(...) so do all such creatures in New-En^land, who neither ^ear God or m^n. To
which I shall add this Verse,

In New England, we do both see and hear.
^oxe^ W^^ves and Ba^es, no God, no King do fear.
And withal, it is not to be forgotten, what a parcel of d^rk con^used (...)
matter thou have set forth concerning Witches and Witchcraft, the which (...)
method had it been followed, might have cost the own Life, wi^h ^he Lives of
all thy Brethren and followers, for had not the D^vil, turned informer against
those twenty put to death in Salem, also informed against the Priests and their
chief upholders* in likeness his appearing put an end with all speed, o^
putting any more to death on the Devils account for Witches, who were not only
put to death as aforesaid, but also their whole Estates were ^u^ned by the
undertakers (...) the Devils wo^k, who through Gods goodness was not suffe^ed,
neither to app^ar or inform against me or mine, or any of my Friends called
Quakers, though many of us were present in S^lem a^ that time, and ^aw most of
their perfideous work, which remains for thee and others who had a hand
therein, to give accoun^; therefore (...) thou not of the mind to let it pass
u^repen^ed of, un^il that day, in which thou must give an account, but repent
and depart from every evil, before the day of account comes, which draws
near to thee, and to all others who in any measure are ^ound with hearts no^
sprinkled from in evil ^onscience, bringing forth the like evil fru^t as
aforesaid appears from thee, with whom to conclude so th^s time, (...) these
following verses.

Hebrew, Greek or Latin, I have not,
Learning ^ave, which by the Truth I got
As in true verse* here is this time to thee,
The Truth of which thou in my verse may see.
While thou keep on thy lying Trade to gain*
I thee withstand, the Truth for to maintain;
A Servant ^it thou art for evil work,
To cea^ well sharp with thee will not thee hurt?
Thou Lives at ease, while others Plow and Sow,
Their labor give, for what well do not know,
The love of Money leads thee for to preach:
Keep that from thee, thou will it no longer teach;
And as to all thy Marchandizing ware,
Such men that buy, their Souls have but ill fare*
Which Trade of thine cannot continue long,
As men see thy deceit will from thee th^ong:
And those that live to God will search thee out;
(...), those of thy own Trade will help to r^ut;
For those of thy own Trade much disagree.
Which shows their fall is near, Gods People see,
It is a Money Trade that with some wit,
With which dishonest men themselves do sit:
Thou has thy masters way to deal with (...).
As in thy Book without thy name at all,
That is, to Boston Wood, the Gallows ^here:
It shows thou art both void of Grace and ^ear;
A better way he finds to dea^ with thee;
To do some good, as all m^n hear may see,
To leave deceit, (...) in some boat to row,
Until a good be, the^ unto preaching go:
I^ boa^ing wo^k, with thee will not (...);
Take other honest Trade, and honest be,
As for thy Trade of preaching we all see,
It starves men's Souls, and also purses free,
But if resolve not with the the Truth to dwell:
Thou must take part with them that go to Hell*
Many things I have against thee more,
And value not the study of thy store.
Thou at the first has wrong with me begun,
Truth will me right so far may see it done.
Which to conclude with Letters of my name;
That thou may certain be from whom it came.
