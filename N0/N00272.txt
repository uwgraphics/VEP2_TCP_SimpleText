T His Court being sensible of the great Ruins in Boston by Fire, at sundry
times, and hazard still of the same, by reason of the joining and nearness of
the Buildings: For the prevention of Damage and loss thereby for the future;

Do Order and Enact, That henceforth no Dwelling House, Warehouse, Shop, Barn,
Stable, or any other Housing, shall be Erected and set up in Boston, except of

hundred pounds in Money to the use of the said Town for every House built
otherwise, unless by allowance and liberty obtained from this Court, from time
to time; And the Constables, and Grand-jury-men of the said Town, are to take
care for the Execution of this Order, and present the breach thereof to the
County Court of Suffolk, that persons transgressing, may be proceeded with
accordingly: And further, the Select Men of Boston are hereby Empowered to hear
and Determine all Controversies relating to the Boundaries of the Lands of such
Persons whose Houses have been burnt down in the late Fires, and liberty of
Appeal to the County Court being allowed to any person agrieved. And the Law
Title New Buildings in Boston, made October. 15. 1679. is hereby Repealed
respecting Buildings to be Erected.
