A MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTION ON THE Fifth of March. Together with a few LINES On
the Enlargement of EBENEZER RICHARDSON, Convicted of MURDER.


AMERICANS! basely, and most inhumanly dismissed, barbarously Unsentenced Case
MAJESTY. Richardson designing wretches, SCOURGE to Tyrannical Rulers,

AWAKE my drowsy Thoughts! Awake my muse!
Awake O earth, and tremble at the news!
In grand defiance to the laws of God,
The Guilty, Guilty murderer walks abroad.
That city mourns, (the cry comes from the ground,)
Where law and justice never can be found:
Oh! sword of vengeance, fall thou on the race
Of those who hinder justice from its place.
O MURDERER! RICHARDSON! with their latest breath
Millions will curse you when you sleep in death!
Infernal horrors sure will shake your soul
When over your head the awful thunders roll.
Earth cannot hide you, always will the cry
Of Murder! Murder! haunt you 'till you die!
To yonder grave! with trembling joints repair,
Remember, SEIDER'S corpse lies mouldering there;
There drop a tear, and think what you have done!
Then judge how you can live beneath the Sun.
A PARDON may arrive! You laws defy,
But Heaven's laws will stand when KINGS shall die.
Oh! Wretched man! the monster of the times,
You were not hung "by reason of old Lines,"
Old Lines thrown by, 'twas then we were in hopes,
That you would soon be hu^g with new made Ropes;
But neither Ropes nor Lines, will satisfy
For SEIDER'S blood! But GOD is ever nigh,
And guilty souls will not unpunished go
Though they are excused by judges here below!
You are enlarged but cursed is your fate
Though Cushing's eased you from the prison gate
The -- Bridge of Tories,it has borne you over
Yet you ever long may meet with HELL's dark shore.
