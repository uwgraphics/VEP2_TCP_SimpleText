A seasonable ADVERTISEMENT to the Freeholders and Freemen of the City of
New York, and all the real Friends to Liberty, and Lovers of their Country.
AS Nothing can be more essential to the Safety of the Country than the
conducting of Elections free from Corruption on the one Hand, and Threats and
Terror on the other. And as a Number of resolute Freeholders and Freemen of
easy Circumstances, who utterly abhor and detest such scandalous Practices, are
credibly informed, that such Artifices are made use of, to destroy the Freedom
of the ensuing Election, they do hereby give Notice to all upon whom any
Attempts of that Kind have been, or may be made, that as soon as the Election
is over, they will devise a Mode for laying the Proofs before the Public, and
bringing the Delinquents to due Punishment, for the double Purpose of exposing
those atrocious Invaders of the Rights of the People, and to do Honor to those
who shall nobly stand to their Integrity; whose Losses will doubtless be amply
recompensed by those worthy Citizens who cannot bear the shocking Spectacle of
seeing Freemen and Englishmen, on Account of their Poverty, treated like the
most abject Slaves. And all Persons are particularly desired to take Notice,
whether any, and who of his Majesty's Council of this Province, are concerned
in influencing the ensuing Election; and to give the proper Intelligence by
leaving an Account thereof with the Printer.

New York, January 12, 1769.
