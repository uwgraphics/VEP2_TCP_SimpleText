WEDNESDAY January 1. 1701. A little before Break-a-day at Boston of
Massachusetts.
ONCE more! Our GOD, vouchsafe to Shine
Tame Thou the Rigor of our Clime.
Make haste with thy Impartial Light,
And terminate this long dark Night.
Let the transplanted English Vine
Spread further still: still call it Thine*
Prune it with Skill: for yield it can
More Fruit to Thee the Husbandman.
Give the poor Indians Eyes to see
The Light of Life: and set them free;
That they Religion may profess,
Denying all Ungodliness.
From hardened Jews the Vail remove,
Let them their Martyred JESUS love;
And Homage unto Him afford,
Because He is their Rightful LORD.
So false Religions shall decay,
And Darkness fly before bright Day:
So Men shall GOD in CHRIST adore;
And worship (...) vain, no more.
So Asia, and (...),
(...), with America;
Four, in Consort joined, shall Sing
Songs of Praise to CHRIST our KING.
