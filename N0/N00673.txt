To the Godly Reader.
WE know that these Psalms, a^ Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, though in other
languages, (and so consequently in other poetical measures) were inspired by
the Holy Ghost, to holy men of old, for the edification and comfort of the
Church, and people of God, in all ensuing ages, to the end of the World. And
for these holy ends, we have with special care and diligence translated them
into such Meeters as are most usual and suitable for such holy Poems, in our
own language; having a special eye, both to the gravity of the phrase of
Sacred Writ, and sweetness of the verse. And for fuller satisfaction of the
godly desires of all, we have added sundry interpretations, according to the
latitude of the significations of the Hebrew Text, commonly noted with an
Asterism thus [*] and some other various readings, though not so noted.

PSALM. XVIII. To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David the servant of the Lord,
who spoke unto the Lord the words of this song, in the day that the Lord
delivered him from all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,
I WILL dearly love the Lord my strength,

And savior mine, my God, my strength,
My shield on whom my trust relies.
My safeties horn, my tower likewise,

Who to be praised worthy is;
So from my foes be saved I shall.

And floods of B^lial frighted me.

The snares of dea^^ preven^ed me.
I,
And to my God cried; he did hear
My voice from's temp^e, and my cry
Before him came into his ear.

Moved hills foundations shook at's ire.

And from his mouth devouring fire,
By it the coals enkindled were.

And he descended; also there
Was at his feet a gloomy cloud.

Yea on the wings of wind he flew.

His covert round about him drew
D^rk wat^rs, and thick clouds of skies.

His thickened clouds did pass likewise
Hailstones, and coals of fire did pass.
(2)

Within the heavens in his ire,
The Highest caused his voice to go
Hail stones and burning coals o^ fire.

And bruising he them scattered:
And lightnings he did hurl about
And them with dread discom^^ted.

(...) the ground-works of the world
Appeared at thy rebuke, at blast
Of thy displeasures breath, O Lord.

The waters great he drew me fro:

From them that hated me also.
For they were mightier than I.

Of that my dark calamity,
Yet was the Lord for me a stay.

He saved me, for he did delight

According as I did aright.
After the pureness of my hands
He gave a recompense to me:

Nor I from God went wickedly.

Nor from me his decrees put I:

Me kept from mine iniquity.
(3)

According as I did aright:
After mine hands integrity,
That did appear before his sight*

Thou merciful thy self wilt show.
Thou upright wilt thy self declare
With such as upright are also.

That thou art pure thou will declare;
But thou will turn thy self awry
Against them all that froward are.

To poor folk; but high looks suppress:

My God will lighten my darkness*

And by my God leaped over a wall

That trust in him, he is shield to all.

Or who a Rock our God b^side?

And me in perfect way does guide.

And on my high place makes me stand.

So well to war he learns my hand.

Thou have bestowed upon me:
And thy right hand has me upheld,
Thy meekness made me great to be.
(4)

So that my ankles did not slide.

I turned not till they were destroyed.

They at my feet did fall subdued.

Unto the war with fortitude.
Thou have subdued under me
Th^se that did up against me rise,

That I might waste mine enemies.

To God, but with no answer meet.

And cast them out as dirt in the street.

From people that contentious be:
Thou of the h^athen made me head,
The ^o^k I knew not, shall serve me.

Themselves shall strangers yield to me.

And from their closets frighted be.
(5)

God of my health exalted be.

And brings down people under me.

And thou did lift me higher then
Those that did up against me rise;
And freed'st me from the violent men*

With thanks the heathen folk among;
Jehovah to thy name express
My praises will I in a song.

Unto his King; and does display
His mercy to's anointed one,
To David and his seed for aye.

PSALM XXXV. A Psalm of David.
PLead Lord with them that with me plead,
Against them fight that fight with me.

Stand up my helper for to be.

Against them that my pursuers be;
And to my soul oh do thou say,
I am salvation unto thee.

That seek my soul how they may spill:
Let them be turned back and shamed
That in their thoughts devise mine ill.

God's angel let them drive also.

God's angel drive them to and fro

They hidden have for me a net:
They causelessly have dug it,
That they therein my soul may get*

Destruction; let his net withal
That he has hid, himself ensnare,
Into that ruin let him fall.

In his salvation joyful be.

Jehovah, who is like to thee
Who sett'st the poor afflicted free
From him that is for him too strong;
Yea, such as poor and needy be,
From him that spoileth him with wrong?
(2)

What I knew not they charged on me,

Whereby my soul might spoiled be.

My clothing then of Sackcloath was:
My Soul I bowed with fasts, my prayer
Did back into my bosom pass.

So my behavior I have kept:
I bowed down with heavy cheer
As one that for his mother wept.

And they together gathered were:
Yea, the abj^cts against me gathered be,
And restless me unwitting tear.
* 16 They mocking parasites among,
In feasts do gnash their teeth at me.

My soul from their destruction free:
My darling free from lions set.

Within the congregation great:
Amongst much people I Will thee praise.
(3)

That are my wrongful enemies:
And they that hate me causlesly,
Let them not twinkle with their eyes.

But in their thoughts they do invent
Against them plots of guilefulness,
That in the land for peace are bent.

And said, ah, ah, our eye it saw,

Lord, do not far from me withdraw.

My God and Lord unto my plea.

My God lest over me joy should they.

Aha, our souls desire have we:
Now have we quite up swallowed him,
Oh let them never say of me.

At once, who at my hurt are glad;
Let such as boast themselves against me,
With shame and with disgrace be clad.

That favor do my righteous c^use:
Yea let them say continually,
Extolled be the Lord with praise,
Who in his servan^s saying well
Does his delightful pleasure take.

And of thy praise all day shall speak.

IN wrath, Lord, do not me chastise,
And in thy rage correct not me

In me thine arrows fastened be

Because thy wrath on me does lie:
Nor in my bones is any rest,
Because of mine iniquity.

Like as an heavy burden lies,
Too heavy they for me to bear.

My foolishness does make it so.

I all day long a mourning go.

And there is no soundness in my flesh.

By reason of my hearts distress.

My groaning is not hid from thee.

And mine eyes sight is gone from me

My friends stand off, my kinsmen eke,

Who seek mine hurt, they mischief speak,
And all day long imagine guile.
I did not hear.
I as a dumb man was the while,
Whose mouth at all not open were.

And in whose mouth reproofs none were.

O Lord my God thou will me hear.

Else they will joy over me with pride:
Themselves against me they magnify,
When as my foot does slip aside.

Also my grief abides with me.

And for my sin will sorry be.

They lively are, and strong also,
Who c^uslesly me have likewise,
In number migh^ily do grow.

To me they adversaries be.

Even so his name continue shall:
And men in him themselves shall bless;
And of the world the nations all
Shall him the blessed one profess.

For by himself alone does he
Work things that wondrous are to tell.

Full with the glory of the same,

For common Tunes.
And ay be blessed his glorious name,

Likewise with glory of the same,

Away from me thou far have put
To them thou loathsome make me,
From coming forth I am up-shut.

And to thee stretch my hands all day.

While I do bear thy horrid fears.

The SONGS in the Prophet Isaiah. CHAP. V.
NOw I to my beloved will
A song of my loves vineyard sing,
He has a vineyard on a hill,
Which in the horn of store does spring,

And planted it with choicest vine,
Amidst it built a tower also
And therein made a press for wine.
He looked grapes it should yield then,
But sour wild grapes it forth did bring*

And men of Judah, judge this thing
Between my vineyard now and me*

Yet when I looked its grapes to see,
Why brought it forth wild grapes therefore?

My vineyards hedge remove will I,
To be devoured, and I Will down throw
Its wall: and it trod down shall lie.

Unprun'd, undigg'd, with brambles spread*
And thorns: and to the clouds I Will say
That they on it no rain shall shed.

The Lord of Hosts his vineyard is*
The men in Judahs tribe that dwell,
They are that pleasant plant of his:
And he for judgment did expect,
But lo there an oppressing wound;
And that they justice should effect,
But lo an out cry there he found.

In the earth, nor have the worldlings slew.

Who dwell in the dust, wake, sing likewise,
For as the dew of herbs thy dew.
The earth shall her dead cast out also

And shut thy doors about thee fast:
Hide thou thy self now as it were,
But for a little moment there,
Until the wrath be over past.

Because of their iniquity:
The earth also shall her blood descry,

Appendix.
Some Essays to fit that Excellent portion of Prophetic Scripture, in the
Twenty sixth Chapter of Isaiah, unto the Tunes more commonly used in our
Psalmody.

First Meeter. 8 and 8. ISAIAH XXVI.
The Title.
WHen Moab shall be trodden down,
And in mount Sion rest God's hand*
In that day shall this Song, to G^d
Be sung all over Judah's land.
The Song.
A City of exceeding strength
Does henceforth unto us belong,
And the decreed salvation shall
Like walls and bulwarks keep it strong.

Tha^ so the righteous nation
That keeps the truths, may enter in
And of it take possession.

whose thoughtful mind is on thee stayed,
And that because his confidence
On thee alone is ever laid.

Throughout eternal ages length:
Because the Lord Jehovah is
A Rock of everlasting strength*

The haughty city he laid low,
He laid it level with the ground,
And it into the dust did throw.

Triumphing trampled i^ upon,
And it ly'th prostrate under foot,
Foot of the poor and needy one.

The very road the just did take:
The path way of the righteous man
Thou did for him most even make.

Thee, Lord, we longing looked to see;
Our souls desire was to thy name,
And to the memory of thee.

My soul thee earnestly desired;
Yea with my spirit in midst of me
^ day and night for thee inquired.
For when thy judgments are displayed
(...) earth, the worlds inhabitants,
Will lay to heart thy righteous works,
And learn the righteousness of saints.

Bowels of divine pity yearn,
Yet he the way of righteousness
By no means will be brought to learn*
In land of righteousness he will
Still work perverse iniquity,
He will not well consider of
Jehovah's glorious majesty.

In exaltation very high,
Lest they should see thine hand, they did
Perversely turn away their eye.
But they with blushing shame, shall see
The zeal thou for thy people have,
And the consuming fire that shall
Thine adversaries wholly wast.

Safety and peace for us ordain:
For our affairs thou manage did
And for us all our works maintain.

Our Lord, yet others besides thee
Have lorded it, and over us
Have exercised tyranny*
But notwithstanding hence forth we
No other lord, save thee will take,
And of no other name but thine
From this time will we mention make.

So dead that they shall live no more,
Their ghosts from hence departed are,
And none shall them to life restore.
Because thou have them visited,
And them have utterly destroyed,
For ever they are perished
And of all memory made void.

Have very much increast, increast
Have thou the nation very much,
Thy glory is made manifest;
That nation which thou had removed,
And far away did send it forth
By dissipating it unto
The utmost ends of all the earth.

They did thee visit with their cries,
And secret prayer they poured out,
When as thou did them chastize.

Approaching childbirth comes apace
Is pained, and in her pangs cry's out,
So were we Lord before thy face.

We have as it were brought forth wind,
The worlds inhabitants fell not,
On earth no safety we could find.

With my dead corpse arise they must;
Awake out of the sleep of death
And sing ye who dwell in the dust:
Because the dew that falls on thee
Is like the dew that makes herbs grow
And down from hence with violence
The earth the Rephaims shall throw.

To chambers that most secret are,
And after thee, shut thou the doors
And fasten them with utmost care:
There do thou hide thy self a while*
It will but as a moment be,
And all the indignation will
Be wholly passed over thee.

Out of his habitation
To punish their iniquity
The earths inhabitants upon.
The' earth shall then disclose and sho^
The bloods in her lay buried,
Her slain shall be exposed to veiw*
And be no longer covered*
ISAIAH XXVI. Second Meeter. Usual.
WE have a City very strong;
( The Church of God is it.)
Salvation to it all along
For Walls and Works He Will set.

The Righteous Nation, who
Do constantly the Truth maintain,
Shall enter thereinto.

Wilt ever have to be,
Whose mind on Thee sincerely stays,
Because he hopes in Thee.

The Hope of all your mind;
For in the Lord Jehovah you
A Rock Eternal find.

Lays the proud City low,
Twice Low, till even with Earth it ly;
To Dust that City throw*

By Feet be Trodden down;
The Feet of men thought Poor and Small;
Trod by the Needy one.

Is very Righteousness;
And thou, O Righteous One, do weigh
Rightly each path of His.

On Th^e Do wait, and Will:
With Souls thy Name desiring, Thee,
Lord, to Remember still.

My Soul seeks Early Thee:
Thy Judgments b'eing on Earth abroad,
Men Justice then will see.

Justice he will not Learn:
He Will in Land of Correction Sin,
Gods Glory not Discern.

Will Not see, but see they shall,
With Shame their Spite at Thine; and then
Thy Foes, Fire burns them all.

Thou do for us prepare;
All our Works for us, we are assured,
By Thee produced are.

Have had Dominion:
But now thy Name we will mention thus,
Thy Name by Thee alone.

To Life Returning not:
God's Visit them destroyed, and made
Their Memory to Rott.

Our Nation do Increase;
So Thou art Praised; And It unto
All parts Extended is.

In an Afflicted Hour;
Chast'ned, an Humble Prayer they did
To thee in Secret pour.

In Pains and Pangs does Cry;
In such a State, O Lord, we were;
God Saw it, God on High,

There Is nothing in the Birth;
On Earth no Health is wrought; and those
Fall not, who Fill the Earth.

So my Dead Body must.
Wake now and Sing, whoever is
Mine, Sleeping in the Dust.
A Dew from Heaven does on thee Come,
Of Springing Plants a Dew:
The Earth which did the Dead Entomb,
Shall yield Dead not a few.

Thy Doors about thee fast:
Hide there a while, my People: But
A while, till wrath be past.

The World for Sin to Smi^e;
Earth will her Bloods Reveal; Her slain
Earth will bring all to Light.
The Doxology, of the Angels, In LUKE II.14.
GLory be to the most High God,
On High let Glory be;
On Earth be glorious Peace abroad;
Now men Great Favor see.
The End.
