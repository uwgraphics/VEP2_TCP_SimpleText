corrupt Ideas from the most modest Expressions; the Crime of that Part is
wholly their own; words modestly expressed, can give no immodest Ideas, where
the Minds of those that read are chaste and uncorrupted. But if a vicious Mind
hears the Vice reproved, and forms pleasing Ideas of the Crime, without taking
Notice of the just Reproof, the Fault is in the Depravity of the Mind, not in
the needful and just Reprover. -- This is a very remarkable Curiosity,

Lately published by ROBERT BELL, of PHILADELPHIA, (Fine Paper, One Shilling,
Common Paper, Nine Pence.) DEATH: A POETICAL ESSAY. BY BEILBY PORTEUS, M. A.
FELLOW of CHRIST COLLEGE. Ah! why will Kings forget that they are Men?
And Men that they are brethren? Why delight
In human sacrifice? Why burst the ties
Of Nature, that should knit their souls together
In one soft bond of amity and love?
PORTEUS. THIS POEM obtained the Prize left by the last Will of Mr. SEATON, as
determined by the Vice Chancellor of Cambridge, etc. -- A Gentleman in America,
who possesses both a literary and religious Taste, because all mankind are
subject to the universal Empire of Death, wishes they would sometimes deign to
view this interesting Scene, in the enlarged Sentiments of our Author, and
therefore desired the Promulgation of this American Edition.
