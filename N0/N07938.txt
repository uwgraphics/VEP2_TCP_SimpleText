PHILADELPHIA, November 7, 1765.
AT a general Meeting of the Merchants and Traders of this City, it was this
Day unanimously Resolved by them (and to strengthen their Resolution they
entered into the most solemn Engagements with each other) that they would not
Import any Goods from GreatBritain until the Stamp Act was Repealed, do
therefore hereby countermand all the Orders have heretofore transmitted to you
for the shipping any Goods, and do expect and insist that you pay a strict and
literal obedience to this injunction; for should they arrive and the Stamp Act
not be repealed, shall not dare to dispose of any Part of them, without a
forfeiture of Honor; nor indeed can engage for their or own Safety.
