A COLLECTION OF PSALMS AND HYMNS.

CHARLESTOWN, Printed by LEWIS TIMOTHY. 1737.

PSALMS and HYMNS For Sunday.
I. Psalm XXXIII.

Your Maker's Praise becomes your Voice;
Great is your Theme, your Songs be new:
Sing of his Name, his Word, his Ways,
His Works of Nature and of Grace,
How wise and holy, just and true!

And the whole Earth his Goodness proves;
His Word the heavenly Arches spread:
How wide they shine from North to South!
And by the Spirit of his Mouth
Were all the Starry Armies made.

Those watery Treasures know their Place
In the vast Storehouse of the Deep:
He spoke, and gave all Nature Birth;
And Fires and Seas and Heaven and Earth
His everlasting Orders keep.

A GOD of such resistless Power,
Nor dare indulge their feeble Rage:
Vain are your Thoughts and weak your Hands,
But his eternal Counsel stands,
And rules the World from Age to Age.
II. Psalm XLVI.

Whose omnipresent Sight
Even to the pathless Realms extends
Of uncreated Night.

To him we raised our Cry:
His Mercy bad our Sorrows cease
And filled our Tongue with Joy.

By Pangs convulsive torn,
Though her self balanced Fabric shake
And ruined Nature mourn:

With all their trembling Load,
No Fear shall ever disturb the Just,
Or shake his Trust in God.

In vain resist his Sway;
For lo! Johovah's Voice is snewn
And Earth shall melt away.

And swell on every side:
The Lord of Hosts our Safeguard is,
And Jacob's God our Guide.
III. Psalm XLVII.

To God the sovereign King!
Let every Land their Tongues employ,
And Hymns of Triumph sing.
Jesus our God ascends on high;
His heavenly Guards around
Attend him rising through the Sky,
With Trumpet's joyful Sound.

Let Mortals learn their Strains:
Let all the Earth his Honors sing;
Over all the Earth he reigns.

Let Knowledge gaide the Song.
Nor mock him with a solemn Sound
Upon a thoughtless Tongue.
Israel flood his ancient Throne,
He loved that chosen Race;
But now he calls the World his own.
And Heathens taste his Grace,

There Abraham's God is known:
While Powers and Princes, Shields and Swords
Bow down before his Throne.
IV. Psalm C.
Jehovah's awful Throne,
Ye Nations, bow with sacred joy.
Know that the Lord is God alone;
He can create, and he destroy.

Made us of clay and formed us Men;
And when like wandering Sheep we shay'd
He brought us to his Fold again.

High as the Heavens our Voices raise;
And Earth with her Ten Thousand Tongues
Shall fill thy Courts with sounding Praise.

Vast as Eternity thy Love:
Firm as a Rock thy Truth must stand
When rolling Years shall cease to move.
V. Psalm CXIII.

Are spent in your Creator's Praise,
Still more and more his Fame express!
Ye pious Worshippers proclaim
With shouts of Joy his holy Name;
Nor satisfied with praising, bless.

Beyond old Times too scanty bound
And through eternal Ages pierce,
From where the Sun first gilds the Streams
To where he sets with purpled Beams,
Through all the wide stretched Universe.

Thy awful and imperial Sway;
Nor Earth thy sovereign Power confines;
Above the Sun's all-chearing Light
Above the Stars and far more bright
Thy pure essential Glory shines.

What Native of eternal Day
Can with the God of Heaven compare?
Yet Angels round thy glorious Throne
Thou stoop'st to view: nor they alone;
Even Earth-born Men thy Goodness share

The Sinner, if in thee he trust,
From depths of guilt and shame thou wilt raise,
That he in Peace and Safety placed
With Power and Love and Wisdom graced
May sing aloud his Savior's Praise.

The God whom Heaven's triumphant Host
And suffering Saints on Earth adore,
Be Glory as in Ages past,
As now it is and so shall last
When Earth and Heaven shall be no more!
VI. Part of Psalm CXV.

Glory alone to God's great Name
Whose Truth shall stand for ever fast,
Whose Love to endless Ages last.

Yet do thy humble Sons approve:
Thou all Events disposest still;
For all obey thy sovereign Will.

But we who by thy Mercy live,
While we have Breath will Offerings bring,
And grateful Hallelujahs sing.

And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Be Honor, Praise and Glory given,
By all on Earth and all in Heaven.
VII. Psalm CXVI.

Did all my Griefs remove,
O Savior, do not now disdain
My humble Praise and Love

And hear me when I prayed,
I Will call upon thee while I live,
And never doubt thy aid.

My Soul encompast round,
Anguish and Sin, and Dread and Pain
On every side I found.

And did for Succor flee:
O save (in my Distress I said)
The Soul that trusts in thee!

How easy to forgive!
The helpless thou delight'st to raise:
And by thy Love I live.

With anxious Thoughts distressed,
God's bounteous Love does thee restore
To Ease and Joy and Rest.

My Feet from falling free,
Redeemed from Death and guilty Fear,
O Lord. I Will live to thee!
VIII. Psalm CXVII.

Ye numerous Nations scattered wide,
To God your grateful Voices raise:
To all his boundless Mercies shown,
His Truth to endless Ages known
Require our endless Love and Praise.

To his dear Son, who deigned to die,
Our Guilt and Errors to remove;
To that blessed Spirit who Grace imparts,
Who rules in all believing Hearts,
Be ceaseless Glory, Praise and Love!
IX. Psalm CXLVI.

And when my Voice is lost in Death
Praise shall employ my nobler Powers.
My Days of Praise shall never be past
While Life and Thought and Being last,
Or Immortality endures.

On Israel's God: He made the Sky
And Earth and Seas with all their Train:
His Truth for ever stands secure;
He saves the Oppressed; he feeds the Poor,
And none shall find his Promise vain.

The Lord supports the fainting Mind,
He sends the laboring Conscience Peace,
He helps the Stranger in distress,
The Widow and the Fatherless,
And grants the Prisoner sweat Release.

And when my Voice is lost in Death,
Praise shall employ my nobler Powers:
My Days of Praise shall never be past,
While Life and Thought and Being last.
Or Immortality endures.
X. Psalm CXLVII.

Our Hearts and Voices in his Praise,
His Nature and his Works invite
To make this Duty our Delight.

He counts their Numbers, calls their Names
His Wisdom's vast and knows no Bound,
A deep where all our Thoughts are drowned

And all his Glory's infinite
He crowns the Meek, rewards the Just,
And treads the Wicked to the Duft.

Who spreads his Clouds around the Sky,
There he prepares the fruitful Rain,
Nor lets the Drops descend in vain.

And clothes the smiling Fields with Corn.
The Beasts with Food his Hands supply
And the young Ravens when they cry.

The spritely Man or warlike Horse?
The piercing Wit, the active Limb?
All are too mean Delights for him.

He views his Children with Delight:
He sees their Hope, he knows their Fear,
And looks and loves his Image there.

Praise him all Creatures here below:
Praise him above, ye heavenly Host
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
XI. Hymn to God the Father.

Unnumber'd Worlds attend,
Jehovah, comprehending all,
Whom none can comprehend!

Which Angels dimly see;
The Fountain of the Godhead owned
And foremost of the Three.

The Son, thine Offspring, flowed;
An everlasting Father thou,
As everlasting God.

Nor quite on Earth concealed:
By wondrous, unexhausted Love
To mortal Man revealed:

When Nature shall expire
And Worlds created by thy Nod
Shall perish by thy Fire.
Jehovah be adored
By Creatures without End,
Whom none but thy essential Word
And Spirit comprehend.
XII. Hymn to God the Son.

Ever Time began to be,
Throned with thy Sire through half the Round
Of wide Eternity!

Display their Author's Power,
And each exalted Seraph Flame,
Creator, thee adore!

Contracted to a Span,
The Coeternal Son of God,
The mortal Son of Man.

Behold his Lifeblood Stream!
Hail, Lord Almighty to create!
Almighty to redeem!

His Church beneath sustains:
Till Nature shall her Judge survey
The King Messiah reigns.

When time shall cease to be,
Throned with the Father through the Round
Of whole Eternity!
XIII. Hymn to God the Holy Ghost.
Jehovah, Third
In order of the Three;
Sprung from the Father and the Word
From all Eternity.

Of firmless Waters lay,
Spoke into Order all that is,
And Darkness into Day.

Thy Presence who can fly?
Known is the Father to thy Sight,
The Abyss of Deity.
Jesus's Life displayed
Quite from the Virgin's Womb,
Dying his Soul an offering made,
And raised him from the Tomb.

Thy Grace restores below.
And Truth and Holiness and Joy
From thee, their Fountain, flow.
Jehovah, third
In order of the three,
Sprung from the Father and the Word
From all Eternity.
XIV. Hymn to the Trinity.

Be endless Praise to thee!
Supreme, essential One, adored
In Coeternal Three.

Ever Time its Round began,
Who joined in Council to create
The Dignity of Man.
Isaiah's Vision showed
The Seraphs veil their Wings,
While thee, Jehovah, Lord and God
The angelick Army sings.

Were humble Praises given,
When John beheld with favored Eye
The Inhabitants of Heaven.

To thee in Hymns aspire:
May we as Angels on our Thrones
For ever join the Choir!

Be endless Praise to thee;
Supreme, essential One, adored
In Coeternal Three;
XV. God's Eternity.

Stretch all thy Thoughts abroad,
And rouse up every tuneful Sound
To praise the eternal God.

Jehovah filled his Throne;
Ever Adam formed or Angels made
The Maker lived alone.

But still maintain their Prime,
Eternity's thy dwelling place,
And Ever is thy time.

The present and the past,
He fills his own immortal Now
And sees our Ages wast.

And vast destruction come;
The Creatures, look how old they grow!
And wait their fiery doom.

And Flame melt down the Skies,
My God shall live an endless Day.
When the old Creation dies.
XVI. From the German.

Thee to perfection who can know?
O Height immense! What Words suffice
Thy countless Attributes to show!
Unfathomable Depths thou art!
I plunge me in thy Mercies Sea;
Void of true Wisdom is my Heart:
With love embrace and cover me.
While thee, All-infinite, I set
Before my ravished Eye,
My Weakness bends beneath the Weight:
I sink, I faint, I die!

Which like thee, no beginning knew;
Thou wast ever Time began his Race,
Ever glowed with Stars the eternal Blew.
Greatness unspeakable is thine
Greatness whose undiminish'd Ray
When short-lived Worlds are lost, shall shine.
When Earth and Heaven are fled away.
Unchangeable, all perfect Lord,
Of Life the boundless Sea,
What lives and moves, lives by thy Word
What is, is all from thee!

Firm fixed this universal Chain:
Else empty, barren darkness still
Had held his unmolested Reign.
Whatever in Earth, or Sea, or Sky
Or shuns or meets the wandering Thought
Escapes or strikes the searching Eye,
By thee was to perfection brought.
High is thy Power above all Height:
Whatever thou wil'st is done:
Thy Wisdom equal to thy Might
Only to thee is known.

Yet Earth partakes thy gracious Sway:
Vain Man! Thy Wisdom, Folly own:
Lost is thy Reason's feeble Ray.
What his dim Eye could never see
Is plain and naked to thy Sight;
What thickest Darkness veil's, to thee
Shines clearly as the Morning Light.
In Light thou dwell'st: Light that no shade
No changes ever knew:
And Heaven above and Hell beneath
Are open to thy View.

The immortal Armies of the Sky:
Thou laugh'sl to scorn the Gods of Earth,
Thou thunder'st, and amazed they fly.
With down cast Eye the angelic Choir
Appear before thy awful Face,
Trembling they strike the golden Lyre
And through Heavens Vault resound thy Praise.
In Earth, Air, Skies, in all thou art:
Creation seels thy Nod,
Whose Hand impressed on every Part
The Image of its God.

Justice and Truth before thee stand:
Yet nearer to thy sacred Throne
Mercy withholds thy lifted Hand.
Each Evening shows thy tender Love,
Each rising Morn thy plenteous Grace;
Thy wakened Wrath does slowly move,
Thy willing Mercy flies a Pace.
Father, to thy indulgent Care
This Light, this Breath we owe:
And all we have, and all we are,
From thee, great Fountain, slow.

Incessant Blessings down distills,
And all in Air or Sea, or Land
With plenteous Food and Gladness fills.
All things in thee, live, move and are,
Thy Power infused does all sustain;
Even those thy daily Favors shate
Who thankless spurn thy easy Reign.
Thy Sun thou bid'st his genial Ray
On all impartial pour;
To all who hate or bless thy Sway
Thon send'st the fruitful Shower.

Shall feel thee a consuming Fire,
How sweet the Joys, the Crown how bright
Of those who to thy Love aspire!
All Creatures praise the eternal Name!
Ye Hosts that to this Courts belong,
Cherubick Quires, seraphick Flames,
Awake the everlasting Song.
Thrice Holy, thine the Kingdom is,
The almighty Power is thine,
And when created Nature dies
Thy ceaseless Glories shine;
XVII. Hymn to Christ.
JESU, behold the Wise from far,
Led to thy Cradle by a Star
Bring Gifts to thee, their God and King:
O guide us by thy Light, that we
The Way may find, and so to thee
Our Hearts, our all for Tribute bring.
Jesu the pure, the spotless Lamb,
Who to the Temple humbly came,
Duteous the legal Rights to pay,
O make our proud, our stubborn Will
All thy Wise, gracious Laws fulfill,
What ever rebellous Nature say.
Jesu, who on the fatal Wood
Pout'dst forth thy Life's last drop of Blood
Nailed to the accursed shameful Cross;
O may we bless thy Love, and be
Ready, dear Lord, to bear for thee
All Shame, all Grief, all Pain, all Loss!
Jesu, who by thine own Love slain,
By thine own Power took'st Late again
And Conqueror from the Grave did rise,
O may thy Death our Hearts revive,
And at our Death a new Life give,
A glorious Life that never dies.
Jesu, who to thy Heaven again
Return'dst in triumph, there to reign
Of Men and Angels fovereign King,
O may our parting Souls take flight
Up to that Land of Joy and Light
And there for ever grateful sing.

One undivided Deity,
All Honor, Power and Love and Praise;
Still may thy blessed Name shine bright
In beams of uncreated Light
Crowned with its own eternal Rays.
XVIII. Adoption.

The Father has bestowed
On Sinners of a mortal Race,
To call them Sons of God!

How great we shall be made
But when we see our Savior here
We shall be like our Head

All Trials to endure:
O purge our Souls from Sense and Sin,
As thou our God art pure.

I share filial Part,
Shower down thy Influence, holy Dove,
And rest upon my Heart.

Like Slaves beneath thy Throne:
O let us Abba, Father, cry
And thou the Kindred own!
XIX. The Christian Race.

Let every trembling Thought be gone)
Awake, and run the heavenly Race
And put a cheerful Courage on.

And mortal Spirits tire and faint:
But we forget the mighty God,
That feeds the Strenght of every Saint.

Is ever new, and ever young,
And firm endures while endless Years
Their everlasting Circles run.

Our Souls shall drink a fresh Supply:
While such as trust their native Strength
Shall melt away and droop and die.

We'll mount aloft to thine Abode;
On Wings of Love our Souls shall fly
Nor tire amid'st the heavenly Road!
XX. Praise.

Thee only will I love;
Thee that my Love may never cease
Incessant will I move.

For thou my Cries have heard;
Marked all the Workings of my Breast,
And have in Mercy spared.

Thy Mercy will I sing:
To thee the Tribute of my Heart
My Soul, my all I bring.

Thou did the Sinner spare:
In vain the Accuser loud replied;
For Love had charmed thy Ear.

Unwearied will I praise,
And in my Heart as in thy Heaven
Thy Throne triumphant raise.

Thou coud'st no more withstand,
But when stern Justice called for Fears
Disarmed her lifted Hand:

Thy Mercy's Fame to raise;
For even Eternity's too short
To utter all thy Praise!
XXI. Christ's Humiliation and Exaltation.

To thee o Lord, our God the Lamb?
Since all the Notes that Angels sing
Are far inferior to thy Name.

The Prince of Peace that groaned and died,
Worthy to rise and live and reign
At his Almighty Father's Side.

Who stood condemned at Pilate's Bar:
Wisdom belongs to Jesus too,
Though he was charged with Madness here.

Instead of Scandal and of Scorn.
While Glory shines around this Head,
And a bright Crown without a Thorn.

Who bore the curse for wretched Men!
Let Angels sound his sacred Name,
And every Creature say, Amen.
XXII. Hymn to the Holy Ghost.

Which gently flow in silent Streams
From thy eternal Throne above:
Come thou enricher of the Poor,
Thou bounteous source of all our Store,
Fill us with Faith and Hope and Love.

The wearied Pilgrim's sweetest rest,
The fainting Sufferer's best relief:
Come thou, our Passions cool allay:
Thy Comfort wipes all Tears away,
And turns to Peace all Joy and Grief.

Water from Heaven our barren Clay,
Our Sickness cure, our Bruises heal:
To thy sweet Yoke our stiff Necks bow,
Warm with thy Fire our Hearts of Snow,
And there cuthron'd for ever dwell.

One everlasting Deity,
All Love and Power and Might and Praise;
As at the first, ever time begun,
May the same Homage still be done
When Earth and Heaven itselt decays.
XXIII. The Offices of Christ.

That comes with Truth and Grace;
Jesus, thy Spirit and thy Word
Shall lead us in thy Ways.

Who offered up his Blood:
Live, Lord, and carry on thy Love
By pleading with our God.

How sweet are thy Commands!
O Guard our Souls from Hell and Sin
In thy Almighty Hands.
Hosannah to thy glorious Name
Who sav'st by different Ways!
Thy Mercies lay a sovereign Claim
To our immortal Praise.
XXIV. Hymn for Sunday.

And bow before thy Throne,
We come to offer all our Vows,
Our Souls to thee alone.

Thy Bounty freely gave:
Thou do us here in Mercy spare,
And wilt hereafter save.

No better Gists for thee?
Thus we confess thy Riches, Lord,
And thus our Poverty.

The mighty Debt we owe:
Far more we should, than we can say,
Far lower should we bow.

And grieve thou have no more,
Bring every Day thy choicest Hoars
And thy great God adore.

On this his own blessed Day,
In it is sweet Task to bear a part,
And sing and love and pray!
XXV. Triumph over Death.

This well wrought Frame decay?
And must these active Limbs of mine
Lie mouldring in the Clay?

Shall but refine this flesh,
Till my triumphant Spirit comes
To put it on a fresh.

And often from the Skies
Looks down and watches all my Do,
Till he shall bid it rise.

Shall these vile Bodies shine,
And every Shape and every Face
Be heavenly and divine.

Lord, to thy dying Love:
O may we bless thy Grace below,
And sing thy Power above.

Of these our humble Songs,
Till Tunes of nobler Sound we rash
With our immortal Tongues.
XXVI. From the German.
JESU, to thee my Heart I bow,
Strange Flames far from ry Soul remove:
Fairest among Ten Thousand thou,
Be thou my Lord, my Life, my Love.

O shine upon my frozen Breast;
With sacred Warmth my Heart inspire,
May I too thy bid Sweetness taste.

Thy streaming Head, thy Hands, thy Side:
All hail, thou suffering, conquering God,
Now Man shall live; for God has died.

And triumph over my willing Breast:
Restore thy Image Lord, therein,
And lead me to my Father's Rest:

Savior, be thou my Love alone;
Never more may mine usurp the Sway,
But in me thy great Will be done!

All Things for thee I count but Loss;
My sole desire, my constant Aim,
My only Glory be thy Cross!
XXVII. Thanksgiving for God's particular Providence.

My rising Soul surveys,
Why my cold Heart, art thou not lost
In Woader, Love and Praise?

And all my Wants redress.
While in the silent Womb I lay
And hung upon the breast.

Thy Mercy lent an har
Ever yet my feeble Thoughts had learned
To form themselves in Prayer.

Thy tender Care bestowed,
Before my infant Heart conceived
From whom thole Comforts flowed.

With heedless Steps I ran,
Thine Arm unseen conveyed me safe
And led me up to Man.

I gently cleared my way.
And through the pleasing Snares of Vice,
More to be feared than they

My daily Thanks employ;
Nor is the least a chearsal Heart
That tastes those Gifts with Joy.

Thy Goodness I Will pursae.
And after Death in distant Worlds
The pleasing Theme renew.

A grateful Song I Will raise:
But o! Eternity's too short
To utter all thy Praise.
XXVIII. A Morning Hymn.

Thy Gifts are every Evening new:
And Morning Mercies from above
Gently distill like early Dew.

Great Guardian of my sleeping Hours:
Thy sovereign Word restores the Light
And Quickens all my drooping Powers.

To thee I consecrate my Days:
Perpetual Blessings from thy Hand
Demand perpetual Songs of Praise.
XXIX. Heaven begun on Earth.

And let your Joys be known,
Join in a Song with sweet accord
While ye surround his Throne.

That never knew our God:
But Servants of the heavenly King
May speak their Joys abroad.

That all the Earth surveys,
That rides upon the stormy Sky
And calms the roaring Seas.

Our Father and our Love:
Thou shall send down thy heavenly Powers
To carry us above.

And never, never Sin;
There from the Rivers of thy Grace
Drink endless Pleasures in.

To that immortal State,
The Thoughts of such amazing Bliss,
Should constant Joys create.

Glory begun below:
Celestial Fruits on earthly Ground
From Faith and Hope may grow.

And every Fear be dry:
We Are marching through Immanuel's Ground
To farer Worlds on high:
XXX. The Names of Christ.

That ever Men or Angels bore,
All are too mean to speak thy Worth,
Savior, or set thy Glories forth.

Thou take'st to teach thy heavenly Grace:
My Eyes with Joy and Wonder see
What Forms of Love thou bear for me.

By thee the joyful Traings came,
Of Wrath appeased, of Sins forgiven,
Of Hell subdued, and Peace with Heaven.

I would be walking near thy Side:
O never let me run astray,
Nor follow the forbidden Way.
Jesus my great high Priest has died,
I seek no Sacrifice beside;
Thy Blood did once for all atone,
And now it pleads before thy Throne.

Thy Scepter and thy Sword I sing,
Thine is the Victory and I sit
A joyful Subject at thy Feet.

The Captain of Salvation leads:
March on, nor fear to win the Day,
Though Death and Hell obstruct the Way

Put on their Forms of Mischief on,
I shall be safe, for Christ displays
Salvation in more powerful Ways.
XXXI. Solomon's Song, Chapter 2. Ver. 8. etc.

Over the Rocks and rising Grounds,
Over Hills of Guilt and Seas of Grief
He leaps, he flies to my Relief,

With Eyes of Love he looks at me,
Now in the Golpel's clearest Glass
He shows the Beauties of his Face.

Both with his Beauties and his Tongue;
Rise, says my Lord, make haste away,
No mortal Joys are worth thy Stay.

The Mists are fled, the Spring comes on,
The sacred Turtle Dove we hear
Proclaim the new, the joyful Year.

Blossoms and buds and gives her Fruit;
So we are come to taste the Wine;
Our Souls rejoice and bless the Vine:
Jesus say
Rise up, my Love, make haste away!
My Heart would fain out-fly the Wind,
And leave all earthly Loves behind.
XXXII. Verse 14, etc.

The Hope thine Invitation gives:
To thee my joyful Lips shall raise
The Voice of Prayer, the Voice of Praise.

Our Hearts, our Hopes, our Passions join:
Not let a Motion or a Word,
Or Thought arise to grieve my Lord.

Till the sweet drawing Light I see,
Thine Eyes to me ward ever turn,
Nor let my Soul in Darkness mourn.

Leap over these Hills of Fear and Sin:
Nor Guilt nor Unbelief divide
My Love, my Savior from my Side.
XXXIII. Sincere Praise.

How glorious is thy Name!
Thy Wonders how diffused abroad,
Throughout Creations Frame!

The Rose and Lilly stand:
And free from Pride their Beauties spread
To show thy skillful Hand.

With unambitious Song,
And bears her Maker's Praise on High
Upon her artless Tongue.

To my Creator too;
Fain would my Heart adore my King
And give him Praises due.

Spoils all that I perform,
Cursed Pride that creeps securely in
And swells a haughty Worm.

Or praise thee with Design,
Part of thy Favors I forget,
Or think the Merit mine.

Else all my Worship's vain:
This wretched Heart will ne'es prove true
Till it be formed again.

And seize me from above!
Wrap me in Flames of pure Desire
A Sacrifice to love.

The remnant of my Days,
And to my God my Soul ascend
In sweet Perfumes of Praise!
XXXIV. O ye Spirits and Souls of the Righteous, bless ye the Lord.

Ye high born Sons of Fire!
Whose Hearts burn chaste, whose Flames shine bright,
All Joy, yet all Desire.

And Expectation sat,
Till for its King, Heaven did set open
Its everlasting Gate.

Who brought that early Ray,
Which from our Sun reflected came,
And made a glorious Day.

Bravely rejoiced to prove,
How weak, pale Death, are all thy Darts
Compair'd to those of Love.

Renounced all low Desires,
Who wisely fixed your Hearts above,
And burnt with heavenly Fires.

Who make that glorious Ring
About the sparkling Throne of Love
And there for ever sing.

Accept this little Wreath,
Which while their lofty Notes they raise
We humbly sing beneath.
XXXV. The Shortness of Life.

And Days how swift they are:
Swift as an Indian Arrow flies
Or as a shooting Star!

Then glide away in haste
The we can never say they are here!
Eat only say, they are past!

And Death is ever nigh;
The Moment when our Lives begin
We all begin to die.

Thy lasting Favors share:
Yet with the Bounties of thy Grace
Thou load'st the rolling Year.

And we are clothed by Love,
While Grace stands pointing out the Road
That leads our Souls above.

All Glory to the Lord!
Thy Mercy never knows a Bound,
Be thy great Name adored!

And when we close our Eyes,
Let following Times thy Praise prolong,
Till Time and Nature dies.
XXXVI. Christ our Wisdom, etc.

We lie, till Christ restores the Light
Wisdom descends to heal the Blind
And chase the Darkness of the Mind.

Till thy atoning Blood appears:
Then we awake from deep distress
And sing, the Lord our Righteousness.
Jesus beholds where Satan reigns,
Binding his Slaves in heavy Chains,
He sets the Prisoners free and breaks
The iron Bondage from our Necks

Grace, Wisdom, Power and Righteousness.
Thou art our mighty All, and we
Give our whole selves, o Lord, to thee.
XXXVII. Gloria Patri.

To whose celestial Source we owe
Rivers of endless Joys above
And Rills of Comfort here below.

Forth from thy wounded Body rolls
A precious Stream of vital Blood,
Pardon and Life for dying Souls.

Who in our Hearts of Sin and Woe
Make's living Springs of Grace arise
And into boundless Glory flow.

And God the Spirit we adore;
That Sea of Life, and Love unknown
Without a Bottom or a Shore.
XXXVIII. Hymn to Christ.
Jesus, why, why do thou Love
Such worthless Things as we?
Why is thy Heart still toward us
Who seldom think on thee?

And we thy Gifts abuse:
Thy Bounty gives us even thy self,
And we thy self refuse.

Such wretched Things as these?
These that withdraw us from our Lord
And his pure Eyes displease?

Up to those Joys above,
Behold all these our Lord prepares
To gain and crown thy Love.

Unless thou draw our Heart!
Thou who vouchsaf'st to make us know.
O make us do our part.

That I may still love thee:
Still make me love thee, o my God
That thou may still love me.
XXXIX. Prayer.

Thou God that hear'st the Prayer,
Do our Requests invade the Sky
And pierce thy bending Ear!

If I but lift my Eye;
Thou gracious Father, can no more
Not hear, than thou can die.

Which gives this All to be,
Connects the Center with the Sphere
And spans Infinity?

Whatever we wish is there;
Thy Power exceeds our scant Desire
And blames our partial Prayer.

Which when thou coud'st not die,
Descending from thy Throne above
Put on Mortality!

Our Guilt and Curse to assume,
To burst the Bars that stopped thy Grace
And make thy Bounty room.

This my Companion be;
So shall I all my wants obtain,
Obtain all Heaven in thee!
XL. From the German.
Jesu, Source of calm Repose,
Thy like nor Man nor Angel knows,
Fairest among ten thousand fair!
Even those whom Death's sad Fetters bound,
Whom thickest Darkness compast round
Find Light and Life if thou appear.

Ever rolling Planets knew to shine,
Ever Time its ceaseless Course began;
Thou when the appointed Hour was come
Did not disdain the Virgin's Womb,
But God with God were Man with Man:

Thou by thy dying, Death have slain,
My great Deliverer and my God!
In vain does the old Dragon rage,
In vain all Hell its Powers engage:
None can withstand thy conquering Blood.

Thy gracious Father's sovereign Will,
To thy dread Scepter will I bow:
With duteous Reverence at thy Feet,
Like humble Mary, lo, I sit,
Speak, Lord, thy Servant hears now.

Lowly and gentle may I be;
No Charms to thee but these are dear:
No Anger may thou ever find;
No Pride in my unruffled Mind
But Faith and Heaven-born Peace are there.

That Life and all Things cast behind,
Springs forth, obedient to thy call,
A Heart that no desire can move,
But still to adore and praise and love,
Give me, my Lord, my Life, my All.
PSALMS and HYMNS For Wednesday or Friday
I. Psalm XXXVIII.

Restore thy Servant, Lord!
Nor let a Father's Chast'ning prove
Like an Avenger's Sword!

And over my Head are gone,
Too heavy they for me to bear,
Too great for me to atone.

My Head still bending down:
And I go mourning all the Day,
Father, beneath thy Frown.

Thine Eye counts every Tear,
And every Sigh and every Groan
Is notic'd by thine Ear.

O hearken to my cry;
O bear my fainting Spirits up,
When Satan bids me die.

I grieve for all my Sin;
My helpless Impotence I see,
And beg Support divine.

Be thou for ever nigh!
O Lord of my Salvation haste,
And save me, or I die!
II. Psalm LI.

Though all my Crimes before thee lie,
Behold me not with angry Look,
But blot their Memory from thy Book.

And form my Soul averse from Sin:
Let thy good Spirit never depart,
Nor hide thy Presence from my Heart.

Cast out and banished from thy Sight
Thy saving Strength, o Lord restore,
And guard me that I fall no more.

His help and comfort still afford:
And let a Wretch come near thy Throne
To plead the Merits of thy Son.

And owns thy dreadful Sentence just:
Look down o Lord with pitying Eye,
And save the Soul condemned to die.

Sinners shall learn thy sovereign Grace:
I Will lead them to my Savior's Blood,
And they shall praise a pard'ning God.

Salvation shall be all my Song,
And all my Powers shall join to bless
The Lord my Strength and Righteousness.
III. Psalm XC.

Thou art our Rest, our safe Abode:
High was thy Throne ever Heaven was made,
Or Earth thy humble Foot stool laid.

Or Dust was fashioned into Man:
And long thy Kingdom shall endure,
When Earth and Time shall be no more.

Made up of Guilt and Vanity:
Thy dreadful Sentence, Lord, was just:
Dust as thou art, return to dust.

Sweeps us away, our Life's a Dream:
An empty Tale, a Morning Flower,
Cut down and withered in an Hour.

How short the Term, how frail the State!
Or if to Eighty we arrive,
We rather sigh and groan than live.

And kindly lengthen out our Span,
Till from the Chains of Sin set free
We find immortal Life in thee!
IV. The same.

And Justice grow severe,
Thy dreadful Wrath exceed, our Thoughts,
And burns beyond our Fears.

By one Offense to thee
Adam with all his Sons have lost
Their Immortality.

A Fable or a Song,
By swift Degrees our Nature dies,
Nor can our Joys be long.

To three score Years and ten:
And all beyond that short Account,
Is sorrow, Toil and Pain.

And not thy Wrath alone!
O let our sweet Experience prove
The Mercies of thy Throne.

TO improve the Hours we have:
That we may act the wiser Part,
And live beyond the Grave.
V. A Thought in Affliction.

The Fruit of Guilt and Fear?
Me, who thy Justice have provoked,
O will thy Mercy spare?

Savior, thy Sufferings plead:
O quench not then the smoking Flax,
Nor break the bruised Read!

Resigned to thy Decree;
Ordain me or to live or die,
But live or die in thee.

My humbled Soul is cast!
O bear me safe through Life, through Death,
And raise me up at last!

This mortal Frame shall sing,
Where is thy Victory, o Grave,
And where, o Death, thy Sting!
VI. On the Crucifixion.

That Earth and Heaven amaze?
Wherefore do Earthquakes cleave the Ground,
Why hides the Sun his Rays?

With sacred Horror nod,
Beneath the dark Pavilion spread
O legislative God.

With Jesu sympathize!
Thou Sun, as Hell's deep Gloom be black,
It Is thy Creator dies!

His all atoning Blood!
Is this the Infinite? It Is he,
My Savior and my God!

For me the Death is born!
My Sin gave sharpness to the Nail
And pointed every Thorn!

Break, Lord, the Tyrant's Chain!
O save me, whom thou came to save,
Nor bleed nor die in vain!
VII. Discipline.

O throw away thy Wrath!
My gracious Savior and my God,
O take the gentle Path.

Still unto thee is bent!
Still does my longing soul aspire
To an entire Consent.

Do I approve or own,
But by the Model of thy Book,
Thy sacred Book alone

Although I halt in Peace
Yet still with trembling steps I creep
Unto the Throne of Grace.

For Love will do the Deed;
Love will the Conquest gain with Love
Even strong Hearts will bleed.

Love is a Man of War;
Love can resistless Arrows shoot,
And bit the Mark from far.

That which has wrought on thee,
Which brought the King of Glory low,
Must surely work on me.

What though Man Frailties has?
Thou art our Savior and our God:
O throw away thy Wrath!
VIII. On the Crucifixion.

Nailed to the shameful Tree!
How vast the Love that him inclined
To bleed and die for thee!

And Earth's strong Pillars bend!
The Temple's Veil in sunder breaks,
The solid Marbles rend.

Receive my soul, he cries:
See where he bows his sacred Head!
He bows his Head and dies.

And in full Glory shine;
O Lamb of God was ever pain,
Was ever Love like thine!
IX. A Sinner's Prayer.

O do not then reject my Heart!
Thy Clay that weeps, thy Dust I am
That call's -- O put me not to shame:

Thine is the Deed, the Praise is thine.
A feeble helpless Creature, I
Do at thy Pleasure live or die.

Yea endless Fears without Relief:
Ye (...) exact thy Due forbear,
And ^^are, a feeble Creature, spare.

Nature denies and Flesh would fail)
Lord, pardon, for thy Son makes good
My want of Tears with store of Blood.
X. Judgment.

Over whelmed with Guilt and Fear
I view my Maker Face to Face,
O how shall I appear.

And Mercy may be sought,
My soul with inward Horror shrinks,
And trembles at the Thought;

In Majesty severe,
And sit in Judgment on my soul,
O how shall I appear!

Timely my Sins lament,
And early with repentant Tears
Eternal Woe prevent!

Ever yet it be too late!
And hear my Savior's dying Groans
To give those sorrows weight.

Her Pardon to secure;
Who knows thy only Son has died,
To make that Pardon sure.
XI. Christ's Compassion to the Tempted.

Of our high Priest above;
His Heart is made of Tenderness,
His Bowels melt with Love.

He knows our feeble Frame;
He knows what sore Temptations mean,
For he has felt the same.

Poured out his Cries and Tears
And in his Measure feels afresh
What every Member bears.

But raise it to a Flame,
The bruised Reed he never breaks
Nor scorns the meanest Name

His Mercy and his Power:
We shall obtain delivering Grace
In the distressing Hour.
XII. Frailty.

The giddy Worldling's Snare,
This Beauty, Riches, Honor, Toys
Beneath a Moments Care?

You have no Charms for me:
Delusive Breath be far away!
I waste no Thought on thee.

Both the World's Hosts and thine,
These simple, sad, afflicted, few,
Those numerous, gay and fine!

I boast my Strength no more.
A willing Slave they blind me fast
With unresisted Power.

Protan thy hallowed Shrine:
Thine is my Soul, by sacred Vows
Of ftrictest Union Thine!

Once more the Captive free,
Renow thy Image in my Breast,
And claim my Heart fro thee.
XIII. Unfruitfulness.

Of thy Salvation, Lord,
But still now weak my Faith is found
And Knowledge of thy Word!

Yet hear almost in vain:
How small a Portion of thy Grace
Can my hard Heart retain!

How little art thou known
By all the Judgments of thy Rod,
And Blessing of thy Throne?

How negligent my Fear!
How low my hope of Joys above!
How few Affections there!

To give thy Word Success;
Write thy Salvation in my Heart,
And make me learn thy Grace.

That leads to Joys on high,
There Knowledge grows without Decay
And Love shall never die.
XIV. From the German.

For thee my thirsty Soul does (...)
My longing Heart implores thy Grace
O make in me thy Likeness shine

Thy Will in all Things may I see.
In Love be every Wish resigned,
And hallowed my whole Heart to thee:

With Lamb-like Patience arm my Breast:
When Grief my wounded Soul assails
In lowly Meekness may I rest.

How ever Life's various carrent flow;
With steadfast Eye mark every Step,
And follow thee wherever thou go.

Alone thou have the Vinepress trod:
In me thy Strengthening Grace be shown,
O may I conquer through thy Blood!
Sion thou shall stand,
And all Heaven's Host adore their King,
Shall I be sound at thy Right Hand,
And free from Pain thy Glories sing.
XV. Faith in Christ.

Our Sin how deep it stains!
And Satan binds our captive Souls
Fast in his slavish Chains.

Sounds from thy sacred Word,
Here ye despairing Sinners come
And trust upon the Lord.

And runs to this Relief.
I would believe thy Promise, Lord!
O help my unbelief.

Incarnate God, I fly:
Here let me wash my spotted Soul
From Crimes of deepest Die.

My reigning Sins subdue:
Drive the old Dragon from his Seat
With his infernal Crew.

Into thy Arms I fall;
Be thou my Strength and Righteousness,
My Jesus and my All.
XVI. Longing.

Weary and faint to thee my Cries,
To thee my Tears, my Groans I send;
O when shall my Complainings end?

Accursed of God: My Head turns round,
My Throat is hoarse; I faint, I fall,
'Yet falling still for Pity call.

From thee their source to Earth below:
Mothers are kind, because thou art,
Thy Tenderness over flows their Heart.

Hear, Bowels of Compassion, hear!
O give not to the Winds my Prayer!
Thy Name, thy hallowed Name is there.

The Shame, the Pangs, the Flames, I feel!
Consider, Lord, thine Ear incline:
Thy Son has made my Sufferings thine.
Jesu, on th'accursed Tree
Did bow thy dying Head for me:
Incline it now! Who made the Ear
Can he, can he forget to hear?

It stirs, it creeps, it aims at thee!
Haste, save it from the greedy Tomb!
Come, every Atom bids thee come!

O be thy Mercy never forgot!
Locked is thy Ear? Yet still my Plea
May speed, for Mercy keeps the Key.

And fall to nothing! Thou on high
See me undone! yet am I styled
By thee (lost as I am) thy Child!

Thy Promises; they speak, they chide,
They in my Bosom pour my Tears,
And my Complaint present as theirs.
Jesu! Hear my broken Heart!
Broken so long, that every part
Has got a Tongue which never shall cease,
Till thou pronounce, depart in Peace,

By these thy Feet at which I lie;
Pluck out thy Dart: Regard my Sighs:
Now heal my Heart, or now it dies.
XVII. Salvation by Grace.

How great our Guilt has been!
Foolish and vain were all our Thoughts,
And all our Lives were Sin.

For ever love his Name,
Who turns thy Feet from dangerous Ways
Of Folly, Sin and Shame.

Which our own Hands have done;
But we are saved by sovereign Grace
Abounding through thy Son.

That all our Hopes begin;
It Is by the Water and the Blood
Our Souls are washed from Sin:

Who hung upon the Tree
Thy Spirit is sent down to breath
On such dry Bones as we.

And justified by Grace,
We shall appear in Glory too
And see our Father's Face.
XVIII. Inconstancy.
Jesus when, when shall it be,
That I no more shall break with thee!
When will this War of Passions cease,
And my free Soul enjoy thy Peace?

Now I revive and now am Slain:
Slain with the same unhappy Dart,
Which, o! too often wounds my Heart.

A Garden sealed to all but thee:
No more exposed, no more undone:
But live und grow to thee alone!

And draw me on with thy sweet Force?
Still make me walk, still make me tend
By thee my Way, to thee my End;
XIX. Christ our Righteousness.

That hangs upon our Eyes!
Till Christ with his reviving Light
Upon our Souls arise!

To meet the Wrath of Heaven:
But in thy Righteousness arrayed
We see our Sins forgiven.

Are all our Thoughts and Ways:
Thy hand infected Nature cure
With sanctifying Grace.

To hold our Souls in vain:
Thou set'st the Sons of Bondage free,
And break'st the cursed Chain.

To bring us near to God,
Thy sovereign Power, thy healing Grace
And thine atoning Blood.
XX. From the German.

To thee, her Source my Spirit flies,
My Wants I mourn, my Chains I see
O let thy Presence set me tree!

In thy Death, Savior, let me (...)
Grieved with thy Grief, pained with thy Pain,
Never may I feel Self-Love again
Jesus vouchsase my Heart and Will
With thy meek Lowliness to fill;
No more her Power let Nature boast,
But in thy Will may mine be lost.

I exercise me in thy Word:
Yet vile Affections claim a part,
And thou have only half my Heart.

Of thy enlivening Power implore:
My Mind must deeper sink in thee;
My Foot stand firm, from wandering free.

Your Strength, here all your Wisdom sails;
Who bids a sinful Heart be clean?
Thou only, Lord, supreme of Men.

Thou never did unfaithful prove:
And well I know thou stand'st by me,
Pleased from my self to set me free.

To banish every Thought of ill;
Till thou in thy good Time appear
And sav'st me from the Fowler's Snare.

God will destroy the Power of Hell:
God from the Land of Wars and Pain
Leads me, where Peace and Safety reign.

Father, all thy Commands to do:
Ah deep engrave it on my Breast,
That I in thee even now am blessed;

And plunge me in thy Mercie's Sea,
Then even on me thy Face shall shine
And quicken this dead Heart of Mine.

So shall I thy hid Sweetness know,
And feel (what endless Age shall prove)
That thou, my Lord, my God art Love!
PSALMS and HYMNS For Saturday.
I. Psalm XIX.

Declares its Maker God,
And all his starry Works on high
Proclaim his Power abroad.

Still keep their Course the same,
While Night to Day and Day to Night
Divinely teach his Name.

Their general Voice is known:
They show the Wonders of his Hand,
And Orders of his Throne.

Where he reveals his Word:
We are not left to Nature's Voice
To bid us know the Lord.

Are set before our Eyes;
He puts his Gospel in our Hands
Where our Salvation lies:

His Truth without Deceit,
His Promises for ever sure.
And his Rewards are great.

Thy Glory to proclaim,
Accept the Praise, my God and King
In my Redeemer's Name.
II. The same.

And all the wide, etherial Sky,
And spangled Heavens, a shining Frame,
Their great Original proclaim.
The unwearied Sun from Day to Day
Does his Creator's Power display
And publishes to every Land
The Work of an Almighty Hand.

The Moon takes up the wondrous Tale,
And nightly to the listening Earth
Repeats the Story of her Birth:
While all the Stars that round her burn
And all the Planets in their Turn,
Confirm the Tidings as they roll,
And spread the Truth from Pole to Pole,

Move round this dark terrestrial Hall?
What though nor real Voice nor Sound,
Amid their radiant Orbs be found.
In Reasons Ear they all rejoice,
And utter forth a glorious Voice,
For ever singing as they shine,
They Hand that made us is divine;
III. The same.

Declares the Glory of thy Name,
There thy rich Works of Wonder shine:
A Thousand starry Beauties there,
A Thousand radiant Marks appear
Of boundless Power and Skill divine.

The dawning and the falling Light
Lectures of heavenly Wisdom read:
With silent Eloquence they raise
Our Thoughts to our Creator's Praise,
And neither Sound nor Language need.

Far as the Journeys of the Sun,
And every Nation knows their Voice:
The Sun like a young Bridegrom dressed
Breaks from the Chamber of the East
Rolls round and makes the Earth rejoice.

He smiles and speaks his Maker God:
Ann Nature joins to show thy Praise:
Thus God in every Creature shines;
Fair are the Book of Nature's Lines;
But fairer is thy Book of Grace.

What Joy and Light those Leaves afford
To Souls benighted and distressed;
Thy Precepts guide my doubtful Way,
Thy Fear forbids my Feet to stray;
Thy Promise leads my Heart to rest.

O cleanse me from my secret Faults,
And from presumptuous Sins restrain:
Accept my poor Attempts of Praise,
If I have read thy Book of Grace
And Book of Nature not in vain.
IV. Psalm LXV.

Far as the Earth's remotest Ends;
Where the Creator's Name is known
By Nature's feeble Light alone.
At thy Command the Morning Ray
Smiles in the East and leads the Day;
Thou guid'st the Sun's declining Wheels
Over the Tops of Western Hills.

The Evening and the Morn rejoice
To see the Earth made soft with Showers,
Laden with Fruit and dressed in Flowers.

Thou giv'st the thirsty Ground supply;
Thou walk'st upon the Clouds, and thence
Do thy enriching Drops dispense.

Abundant Fruit the Valleys yield
The Valleys shout with cheerful Voice,
And neighboring Hills repeat their Joys.

Where Lambs and larger Cattle play:
The larger Cattle and the Lamb,
Each in his Language speaks thy Name.

Over every Field thy Glories shine:
Through every Month thy Gifts appear,
Great God, thy Goodness crowns the Year.
V. Psalm CIV.
Part I.

Almighty, everlasting King,
Creator! wondrous to survey
Thy Works excite the grateful Lay.
From thy bright Throne beyond you Height
Spread Plains of Empyrean Light,
The Spheres assume the second place,
Swift moving through The Eternal Space.

The Regions of the inferior Sky.
Here float the Clouds, the Thunders roll,
And Tempests whirl from Pole to Pole.
Here thy obedient Spirits find
The Stores of Vengeance for Mankind:
And pleased thy Orders of perform
Lance the not Bolt, or drive the Storm.

The deep involved the shapeless Globe;
And now though the proud Surges rise,
Range the wide wast, and threat the Skies,
Fixed is their Bound, their Tumults end;
Yet where thou bidst the Main extend,
Awed by thy Voice aloof they roar,
Or gently leave th'uninjured shore.

Through the tall Mountains secret Veins;
Thence down the silver Currents flow
And wander through the Vales below.
And while their Streams fresh Moisture yield
To the dry Cattle of the Field.
Lo, Trees project their Branches fair
And lodge the Songsters of the Air.
Part II.

The former and the latter Rain:
See straight Herbs, Flowers and Fruits appear,
And various Plenty crowns the Year.
Grass for the Beast, the Olive grows
For Man, and the rich Vintage flows
His Life and Vigor to sustain
Waves over the Field the ripening Grain.

Unnumber'd Blessings without End!
"Through all the Earth thy Glories shine,
Thy Works pronounce thy Power divine"
To their full growth by just Degrees
Majestic rise the fovest Trees
Up to the Clouds their Arms they throw.
Their Roots the Center seek below.

Here hospitable Shelter find
The Stork in the tall Fir-Trees height
Here leaves her Brood, and wings her Flight.
And where their shadowy Gloom they throw
Wide waving over the Mountains Brow
Earth's feebler Tribes rejoice to share
Thy tender Love and guardian Care.
Part III.

Fills her pale Orb with borrowed Rays,
The appointed Sun with just Carrcer
Metes out the Day, the Month, the Year,
His Lamp withdrawn then ravening stray
Wild Beasts, outrageous for their Prey;
The Lion roars his wants aloud
And roaring, seeks his Meat from God.

Back to their Dens they haste away:
Nor sooner are the Shades of Night
Fled from the Suns returning Light,
Then the strong Husbandman renews
His Toil, his daily Task pursues,
Till Evening calls again to rest,
Both toiling Man and weary Beast.

O Lord, in all thy Hands have made!
Lost in amazement down we fall;
In Wisdom thou have made them all.
How on the Earth thy Riches shower
Incessant, unexhausted Store;
New every Morn thy Gists appear;
Great God, thy Goodness fills the Year!

The Sea no less thy Goodness shows,
Here the finn'd Race unnumber'd stray,
Dive deep, or on the Surface play.
Here huge Leviathan may reign
Sole Tyrant of the watery Plain.
He moves; the boiling Deeps divide:
He breathes a Storm and spouts a Tide.
Part IV.

In thee they live and move and are!
The copius Good thy Hand bestows
Enjoy, and praise thee as it flows.
But thy blessed Influence once withdrawn,
No more Joy, Light or Comfort dawn:
Dire Pain succeeds and sad Decay,
And Death demands his destined Prey.

Stand, while the Individuals fall;
Thy timely Care each Chasm suppleis,
One rising as another dies.
Hence through the whole Creation known
Still shall thy Gaardian Power be shown
Till at thy Word devouring Flame
Consame the universal Frame.

When Earth and Heaven shall melt away,
Thou still, my Soul, shall sound abroad
Praise to thy Father, and thy God.
Praise thou the Lord: He is thy Friend,
The Cause of all Things and their End!
Over Earth, Seas, Heaven, let Time prevail!
The Rock thou buil'dst on, cannot fail.
VI. Psalm CXIV.
Israel freed from Pharoah's Hand,
Left the proud Tyrant and his Land,
The Tribes with cheerful Homage own
Their King, and Judah was his Throne.

The Deep divides to make them way:
Jordan beheld their March and fled
With backward Current to his Head.

Like Lambs the little Hillocks leap:
Not Sinai on the Base could stand,
Conscious of Sovereign Power at Hand.

Make Jordan backward roll his Tide?
Why did ye leap, ye little Hills?
And whence the Fright that Sinai feels?

Retire, and know the approaching God,
The King of Israel: See him here,
Tremble thou Earth; adore and fear!

The Rock to standing Pools he turns;
Flints spring with Fountains at his Word,
And Fires and Seas confess the Lord.
VII. Psalm CXLVIII.
Part I.

To praise The Eternal God,
Ye heavely Hosts the Song begin
And sound his Name abroad.

And Moon with paler Rays,
Ye starry Lights, ye sparkling Flames
Shine to your Maker's Praise.

And fixed their wrondrous Frame,
By his Command they stand or move
And ever speak his Name.

Or fall in Showers, or Snow,
Ye Thunders murmuring round the Skies
His Power and Glory show.

Agree to praise the Lord,
When ye in vengeful Storms conspire
To execute his Word.

His Honors be expressed:
But those who taste his saving Love
Should sing his Praises best.
Part II.

They owe their Maker Praise:
Praise him, by watery Worlds below
And Monsters of the Seas.

Let his loud Praise resound:
From humble Shrubs and Cedars high
And Vales and Fields around.

And tamer Beasts that graze,
Ye live upon his daily Food,
And he expects your Praise.

On high his Praises bear:
Or sit on flowery Bows and sing
Your Maker's Glory there.

His various Wisdom show;
And Flies in all your shining Forms
Praise him that dressed you so.

His Honors be expressed:
But those that know his heavenly Grace
Should learn to praise him best.
Part III.

Praise ye The Eternal King:
Judges, adore that sovereign Hand
Whence all your Honors spring.

To sound his Praises high
While growing Babes and withering Age
Their feebler Voices try.

His wondrous Fame to raise:
God is the Lord; his Name alone
Deserves our endless Praise.

And all pronounce him blessed:
But Saints who dwell so near his Heart
Should sing his Praises best.
VIII. Universal Praise.

Strives to adore our bounteous King.
Hark, each a double Tribute pays:
First sings its part and then obeys.

Their Lord with cheerful Notes admire
And every Day they chant their Lauds,
The ecchoing Grove their Song applauds.

The Streams too have their Melody,
Both Night and Day they warbling run,
They never pause but still sing on.

Hither their silent Music bring;
If Heaven bless them thaukful they
Do smell more sweet, and look more gay.

Awake and glady sing they part,
Learn even of Birds and Springs and Flowers
How to employ thy nobler Powers.

Since it was he whole Nature made:
Join we in one Eternal Song,
We who to one God all belong.

Live thou by all thy Works adored,
Great-One in Three and Three in One
May all Things bow to thee alone.
IX. Sun, Moon and Stars, praise ye the Lord.

Thou, Sun, whose Rays adorn our Sphere
And with unwearied Swifeness more
To form the Circle of the Year:

Who decks thy Orb with borrowed Rays:
Or may the Sun forget to rise
When he forgets his Maker's Praiser

Fair Queen of Silence, Silver Moon,
Whose paler Fires and Female Light
Are softer Rivals of the Noon.

Waxing and waining Honors pay,
Who bad thee rule the dusky Hours
And half supply the absent Day.

When Darknefs has her Curtain drawn,
That keep the Watch with wakefull Eyes,
When Business, Cares and day are gone:

Dispersed through all the heavenly Street,
Whose boundless Trasures can afford
So rich a Pavement for his Feet.

Fair Palace of the Court divine,
Where with inimitable Light
The Godhead condescends to shine:

Who scatters lovely Beams of Grace
On every Angel, every Saint,
Nor veils the Luster of his Face.

Thou art the Sun that make our Days:
Midst all thy wondrous Works above
Let Earth and Dust attempt thy Praise!
X. Eupolis's Hymn to the Creator.
Part I.

With never fading Beauties bright.
Thou, Fullness, Goodness, rolling round
Thy own fair Orb without a Bound.
Ei, or Jao, thee we hail,
Great Essence that can never fail!
By Grecian or Barbarick Name,
Thy steadfast Being still the same!

Or Truth, or Good, or One, or All!
Thee, when fair Morning greets the Skies
Now sinks in purple Waves away,
Thee will I sing, O Parent Jove,
And teach the World to praise and love.

Lo! yonder blue, low, liquid Sky,
Lo! Earth on its firm Basis placed,
And round with circling Waves embraced;
All these creating Power confess,
All these their mighty Maker bless;
And still thy powerful Hands sustain
Both Earth and Heaven, both Firm and Main.
Part II.

To thy Pavilion in the Skies;
Nor can a mortal Tongue declare
The Bliss, the Joy, the Rapture there.
Nor solitary do thou reign,
But circled with a glorious Train.
The Sons of God, the Sons of Light,
For ever joying in thy Sight!

While ever beauteous, ever young,
The Angelick Forms their Voices raise,
And through Heavens Arch resound they Praise.
The feathered Souls that swim the Air,
And bath in liquid Either there;
The Lark, Precentor of their Quire,
Leading them higher still and higher,

Repeating in their warbling Throats:
And ever to soft Repose they go
They teach them to their Lords below.
On the green Turf, their mossy Nest,
The Evening Anthem swells their Breast
Thus, like thy golden Chain from high.
Thy Praise unites the Earth and Sky!
Part III.

Round on the burning Axles run;
The Stars like Dust around him fly
And sirew the Area of the Sky.
He drives so swift his Race above
That Mortals cannot perceive him move;
So smooth his Course, oblique or straight,
Olympus shakes not with his Weight.

Fills at his Vase her Orb of Light,
Imparted Luster; thus we see
The solar Virtue shines by thee.
Eiresione we'll no more
Imaginary Power adore,
Since Oil and Wool and chearing Wine
And Life-sustaining Bread are thine.

Flower and Herb and Shrub that grows
Or on Thessalian Tempe's Plain,
Or where the rich Sabeans reign:
That treat the Taste, or Smell, or Sight,
For Food, for Medecin, or Delight,
All planted by thy parent Care
Do spring and smile and flourish there.
Part IV.

Ye ready Brooks and winding Streams,
Or marm'ring over the Pebbles i e shining or smooth.
sheen,
Or sliding through the Meadows green;
Or where through matted Sedge you creep
Slow trav'ling to your parent Deep,
