A MONUMENTAL MEMORIAL OF MARINE MERCY BEING An Acknowledgment of an High Hand
of Divine Deliverance on the Deep in the Time of distress, IN A Late Voyage
from Boston in New England To LONDON, Anno 1683.

In a Poem. By Richard Steer.

To which is added Another Occasioned by Several Remarkable Passages happening
at the Birth of a Male Child on Board the same Ship in her Voyage Returning
1684.

By the same Author then a Passenger.

Printed at BOSTON in New England by Richard Pierce for James Cowse Stationer
Anno 1684.

To the Reader.
Reader
I Here present thee with an Impartial Narrative, Collected from a Diurnall,
and other Credible Informations of some Persons who had a share in this so
never to be forgotten a Deliverance, and at whose Importunity it was Reduced
into this small Tract, and shrouded in the modern Attire of Measure and
Cadency, whose even and easy Pace being more Alluring and Captivating
(Especially with youth, or the Crittically Ingenious of this Age) than the
Elaborate Volumns of Prose left to us by our Worthy Ancestors, may probably the
sooner Decoy or Invite thy Perusal.

I could not Conveniently avoid the use of some Sea phrases The Subject being a
Sea Deliverance, tho they may seem improper and unintelligible to a Land
Capacity. And if I have erred in missap Misapplying those Terms of Art, I hope
the Ingenious Mariner will attribute it to the want of Experience in the
Tarpolin Tongue:

But to put a period to this Epistle, Read and Admire the Mercy, -- Though the
Style
May make thee think it hardly worth the while.


A MONVMENTAL MEMORIAL OF MARINE MERCY etc.
SInce Every Quill is silent to Relate
What being known must needs be wondered at
I take the boldness to present your Eye
With Safty's Prospect in Extremity,
Which tho not Clothed with Academick Skill,
Or lofty Raptures of a Poet's Quill;
But wrapped in rags, through which your eyes may see
The Naked Truth in plain simplicitee.
I without further prologue Lanch with Ink
With Captain Balston in the Adventure Pinck;
Who in December on the fourteenth day,
His Anchors weighed in Massachusetts BAY,
New-England's Chiefest Port, and sailing on,
Soon laid the Land below the Horizon.
The Sea was kind, the Sky serene and clear,
All seem to smile, no threating Frowns appear;
Yet sometimes Clouds of Rain, of Hail, of Snow,
Sometimes the winds more lofty, sometimes low,
The Mariners and Passengers a'board,
Enjoying what the Vessel did afford
With Satisfaction, and in full Content:
This good beginning was Encouragement
Of good success, in hope and expectation
The Ship might prove an Ark of preservation;
Her swelling sayls gave her a nimble motion,
Making her Keel to plough the Yiedling Ocean,
Whose little Billows still her Bow out braves,
Glideing Tryumphant over the Curled waves.
Thus for five weeks the gentler winds did play
Upon the Oceans Surface to convey
Our little Pinck, filling her plyant Sails
With easy Breezes, sweet Topgallant Gailes:
And now the Mariners by Judgment found
We did approach nigh to Great Britains ground
And therefore heaved the Deep-sea lead to sound,
Which tho they Fathomed not did Truth afford,
For the same night a Land bird came a'board,
And the next morning we beheld two more
Which made the Judgment good they gave before.
Had we continued thus upon the Deep
We had bin Charmed into a drowsy sleep
Of calm Security, nor had we known
The Excellence of PRESERVATION:
We had been Dumb and silent to Express
Affectedly the Voy'ges good success.
But to awake and Rowse our sleepy minds,
The Po'wrs above let loose the unruly winds,
Heavens milder Puffs with violence at last
Let fly more fierce, and blow a stronger Blast:
The dark'ned Sky with gloomy Clouds over spread,
Whose moist'ned fleeces have Enveloped
Tempestous Flaws which Issue more and more
In Thunder's Language, or as Cannons roar:
The weighty Seas Roll from the Deeps beneath:
Hill stands on hill by force of Heaven blown breath,
And from the rocks foundations do arise
As tho resolved to storm the Impending Skies;
Flaws from those lofty Battlements are hurld,
As to a Chaos they would shake the world:
Thus as between a war of Sea and Heaven,
From place to place our little Ship is driven;
And by the Seas tossed like a ball in sport,
From wave to wave in Neptunes Tennis Court.
While thus the winds and seas their powers dispute
A neighboring object did our Eyes salute,
A Sail to windward; (in Distress no doubt)
Who Fired a Gun and heaved their Colors out;
We made her English, but no help could give,
The Lofty Seas found each enough to live
But in the morning we to windward were
And Bearing down resolved to speak with her,
And understood she from East India came,
Under Command of Captain Hide by Name
Burden six hundred Tuns and Ninety Men
Having about ten months from India been,
And had bin Beating six weeks on the Coast
Wanting Provis'on, almost spent and Lost:
An Interval of storms became their friend,
And gave us leave some little help to lend:
The storm renewing its Impetuous Force
Did Each from Other further off Divorce,
Yet we might see them two or three days more,
But since have heard that they were drove a, shore
Somewhere in Cornwall, on the Western Coast,
And every Soul except two Boys were lost.
Still the resistless winds rebellious grow,
As they the Universe would Overthrow,
The pondrous seas like Rolling Mountains still,
Each Billow seeming an Alpean hill
By its prodigious Altitude: Despair
And fear of Danger, moves all lips to prayer
Mixed with Industry, but Industry sails,
The Pumps are now in use but not the Sails,
The Artist 's Quadrants now are useless grown,
For Darkness dwells upon our Horizon;
Thus we for several days upon the Ocean
Did Ly a Hull, keeping our Pumps in motion;
Till January twenty sixth at night,
A mighty Sea did Overwhelm us quite,
Which falling down with a resistless stroke
Both our Ships Waste (or well built Gunwalls) broke
And carr'd away: now seeming like a Wreck
From the Fore-castle to the Quarter Deck,
The Long boat, Windless, Captstern, with the blow
Besides two weighty Anchors from the Bow,
With Ropes, and Ring-bolts (where ye Boat was fast,
And we constrained to cut our Mizen mast,)
All lost at once: Afflictions now prevail,
And each man's heart and strength begins to fail;
Sometimes we seem to sink sometimes to float,
The Masters mate tear's from his back his Coat
And stuffs between the Timbers; then they cry
For Bedding, Ruggs, and Blankets eagerly,
Which when obtained they Crowd into each place
Where streams of water Issued in apace:
But all Industry seems without success,
The Rageing storm grows rather more than Less;
Over those Ruggs they added skins of Bears,
And two new Clothes which our new main sail spares;
Here may the hand of providence be Eyed,
The sail was made by those two clothes too wide,
Which by so much, we had made so much less
But a few days before our great Distress;
Ropes Fore and Aft were streched to secure
The Mariners, who scarcely could endure
Those Big-swel'd Billows, (what are feeble men?)
So often washed in, and out and in again,
Sometimes upon, sometimes within the Ocean;
The Pumps never sucking tho in Constant motion;
Whilst all the men and women then on board
With earnest Cries did call upon the LORD.
The Seas did frequently overflow the ship,
And we were often buried in the Deep:
The Chests between Decks swim as in a flood,
Where men up to their knees in water stood,
Expecting every Moment grim looked Death
With that cold Element would stop their breath.
When suddenly a voice salutes our ears,
With Joy unspeakable amidst our Fears,
One of the PUMPS does SUCK! who can believe
What unexpected Comfort a Repreive
Brings a Condemned Convict: So that Voice
Caused each Cast down spirit to Rejoice.
But on the Fifth of February we
Shipped a prodigious Mountain of a sea,
Which with a pondrous and resistless Stroke
The Fixed Table and the Benches broke,
And with its Force Opened the Cabin Door.
A weighty Chest of Tools away it bore,
Then with loud Ecchos every Tongue declares
Our Period come, our Hopes were now Despaires,
For we lay buried in the Oceans Womb,
And might conclude it was our watery Tomb;
But an Almighty power became our Friend,
Causing our buried Vessel to Ascend,
And by degrees climb up the Mountain waves,
From whence our eyes might view our fluid Graves;
Thus the Great God did Snatch us from below,
Unto whose power we all our safeties owe.
Some few days after we a Ship might see,
Which Coming up with understood to be
For England bound, and from Virginia came,
Gregory Sugar was her Captains Name;
So Leaky (that tho they did what they could)
Sh' had six or sev'n foot water in the Hold,
The Safety of their Lives they only sought,
For to preserve their Vessel they could not,
And Hoysting out their Boat to come a'board
Which could not Safety to them all afford,
Yet Thirteen of them soon into it pressed:
And putting off, promised to fetch the Rest:
When they came nigh our Side such fear was shown,
None sought the good of others but his own,
Each striving to preserve himself with have,
without regard to make the Painter fast;
(Had they Endeavored, it had bin in vain)
The Boat such wrong and damage did sustain;
In Laying us aboard her Bows were Stav'd,
That it was mere Mercy any man was saved:
Soon the Disabled Boat was gone a drift,
And now no hope of preservat'on left
For those behind, who were in number five,
For 'twas not possible the Ship should Live,
Nor with our Vessel did we dare come nigh,
For still the troubled Sea ran mountains high,
Tho their Entreaties, Peircing Cries and Groans,
Might even draw Remorsness out of Stones;
And now because of the approaching night,
We did advise them to hang out a Light,
Which but till eight a Clock appeared in Sight,
After which time it did no more appear,
And we concluded (as we well might fear)
They then went down: Tho we could not relieve
Their wants, their loss we could not choose but grieve.
And now some Comfort we begin to find,
The winds are Calmer and the Seas more kind,
Now Heavens alscourging hand its strokes withdrew
And former Consolations did Renew,
By giving us at length the Sight of Land,
By an Over ruling providential hand:
Our Cloudy cares appear to fly apace,
And Comforts seemingly supply their place;
The fourteenth day at Plymouth we Arrive,
With those thirteen we had preserved alive:
The nineteenth day for London we set sail,
With not too much wind, but a moderate Gale:
But as if Heaven with anger should reprove,
That we those mercies did not well Improve;
Its Breath comes forth with Fury as before,
And we tho in the Downs and nigh the Shore,
Must feel more strokes of the chastising Rod
Of our offended of our angry GOD*
The Two and twentieth day much wind did blow,
When in the Downs we let our Anchor go,
But it came home: we our Shift Anchor Cast,
Which (insignificant) came home as fast,
And we were driven up along the Side
Of a Ship there, which did at Anchor ride,
Our Anchor took her Cable, and did pass
Up with a speedy motion to her Hass,
Which at their Bows they Cutting from the Cable,
And t, other Anchor being too unable
To bring us up, broke in the shank. and we
Again (by Violence) Drove out to Sea;
We thought to Anchor then in Poulstone Bay,
And let our small Bower go without delay,
Which like a rotten stick was quickly broke
(When once it came to strain) both flewks and stock,
Neither Shift-Anchor, Best nor yet Small Bower
To Bring us up had strength enough or power;
And in the Afternoon the winds Restrain
Their furious Blasts, now only did remain
Our small Cedge Anchor, (unto which we must
Our Lives, our Ship, and all her Cargo trust,)
Which Letting go, Heavens care did so provide,
That we that Ebb secure in safety Ride;
From which our apprehensions may Inspect,
How the Great God by Small means does protect,
Whose strength can make our strongest cables weak,
Our Cobwebs strong, no earthly strein can break,
That we might put no Trust in Earthen Powers:
For weak is all the Fortitude of Our's.
An Anchor we that night from Shore obtain.
And so Return into the Downs again,
And weighing thence, favored with winds and floods,
Our selves in Safety with our ship and goods,
The Twenty fifth (assisted by the Lord)
Arrived at London and at Ratcliff Moored.
Thou God of this great Vast, that aloft Command
With thy Almighty Hand,
Water, Earth, Air, and Fire
(The Elements:) the Sun, the Moon, and Stars
Act not their own affairs,
But what thou do require:
O who can view thy power, and not thy power admire.
It Is thou Alone art our alone support,
Thy Mercy's our strong fort,
Thou giv'st us length of days,
To thee the Almighty and Tri-une IEHOVE,
Dwelling in Heav'en above;
Be Everlasting Praise;
O who can taste thy Good, and not Thanksgiving Raise.

A POEM OCCASIONALLY WRITTEN ON Some Remarkables hap'ning at the Birth of the
Son of Thomas and Sarah Wallis upon the Atlantic or Western Ocean, July the 26
1684.
WAllis, (for yet thou have no other Name)
This Poem, if thou live to read the same
In thy maturer years, thou may from thence
Ground Contemplations on God's Providence.
At thy Nativity the Southern Gales
With Gentler Breezes faintly filled our Sails,
The Curled Ocean's wrinkled Brows were down,
Whose Surface Smiled that seemed before to frown,
Neptunes Attendants from the Deeps resort,
And dance Levaltos in his watery Court;
When thou were Born, July the Twenty sixth,
Grampas and Sholes of Porpoise (Intermixed)
Attend the Ship, and Pitterels take Wing,
Both Fish and Fowl Advene the Gossipping:
And when the Evening of the day drew nigh,
The big swelled Clouds darkened the Azure Sky
Shaking their dropping Fleeces on the Maine,
And to their Element return again;
Lightnings bright Flashes issued from the Sky,
And Peals of Thunder Echoed from on high:
These things attended thy Nativity.
The Climate where thou thy first breath did draw,
Was between Europe and America:
About the Latitude of Forty four,
And New Foundland was judge, d the nighest shore*
The Pinck Adventure served at once instead
Of thy Birth-chamber, Cradle, and thy Bed;
Hold not the meaness of the place in Scorn,
For Christ himself was in a Stable born:
When thy reflecting thoughts shall call to mind,
The Hardships incident to Humane kind,
Then let the Eye of Faith thy mind Convey
To view the Manger where thy Savior lay.
Whom God has sent to bear thy sinful load;
Thou have no more to do but serve thy GOD.
Now may the Parents of the Child enjoy,
Succeeding Comforts in their Sea-born Boy,
May his maturer years cause Joy and mirth,
Sweetning the Troubles that attend his Birth.
May they those Consolating Mercies prize,
As from the God of Mercies they Arise,
And from his never-failing Fountains flow,
To make their minds up to Thanksgiving grow,
If the Boy lives and Capable to Read,
Tho the mean Author of these Lines be Dead,
Yet it is his will the Youth should have the same,
And therefore, thereunto Subscribes his name.
RICHARD STEER.

FINIS.
