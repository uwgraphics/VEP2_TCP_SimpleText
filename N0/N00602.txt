A PROCLAMATION
WHereas I have found the Detaching of the Inhabitants of this Province, for
Defense of the Fronteers, has been a grievous Burden, and have used my
outmost Endeavors to provide for the Security of the Fronteers, and the Ease
of the Inhabitants, which is not so far (at present) effected, but that it
requires a Sum of Money to (...)me, as well to retain those that are willing to
serve, as to keep those I have already (...) with the Assembly, making unusual
Condescentions.

And whereas the Assembly have continued sitting Twenty Three Days, which has
been a great Charge to the Country, and have made no suitable Return to answer
the End I have Proposed, I do therefore think fit, by and with the Advice of
the Council, to Dissolve the present Assembly of this Province, and they are
hereby Dissolved accordingly.

Given at Fort William Henry the Two and Twentieth Day of April, 1695. Annoque
Regni Regis and Regina, Gulielmi and Mariae, Angliae, etc. Sept. mo.

Ben. Fletcher.
