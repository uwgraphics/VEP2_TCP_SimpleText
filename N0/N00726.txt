The Memorable Words of Rabbi Samue(...) Marochianus, in his Book, about, The
Coming of the Messiah.
THE Prophet Amos Expressly mentions, that Fourth Crime [Amos 2.6.] of, Selling
the Just one for Silver, for which we have been in our Captivity. It manifestly
appears to me, that for that Sin of Selling the Just one, we are Justly
punished. It is now a Thousand Years, and more; and in all this while, we have
made no Good Hand of it among the Gentiles, nor is there any likelihood of our
ever any more Coming to Good. O my God, I am afraid, I am afraid, Lest the
Jesus, whom the Christians Worship, were the Just one Sold for Silver!

To the JEWISH Nation.
ONE thing that Satisfies Us Christians, in the Truth of Christianity, is Your
Obstinate Aversion to that Holy Religion. Our Blessed JESUS, the Author of our
Faith, foretold your continuance under the Circumstances now come upon you,
until the Times of the Gentiles in the Four Monarchies, just now Expiring, are
Expired. And your own Inspired Prophets, who are now more Ours, than Yours,
foretold your being poenally given up to the Deafness, Blindness, and Hardness
now upon you. But, behold, a Proclamation here sent you from Heaven, inviting
you, to persist no longer in your Damnable Rebellion against the CHRIST of God!
Here is now put into your Hands, an Irresistible and Irrefragable
Demonstration, That though you say, You are Jews, you are not (...) this Essay,
the Common Translation of any Text, is at all varied from, it is (...) with as
Good Authority as any that there is for the Common Translation; and most
Commonly with the Authority of your own Jewish Writers. Be amazed, O ye
Rebellious and Rejected People of our Great Lord Messiah; We Christians, have
by the Wonderful Work of God, been brought unto the Faith of the Fathers; but
you are fallen from that Faith, and under Strong Delusions, you are Pining away
in your Iniquities. Return, O backsliding Israel! All that we Christians desire
of you, or for you, (and we all desire it!) is, That you would Return to the
Faith of the Old Testament. Be it known to you, That if you do not now Submit
unto our Blessed JESUS, all the Glorious Oracles of the Old Testament, will
come in, as Witnesses against you. In the Name of the Great God, I demand it of
you, That you Seriously Consider the Things here laid before you; And be now at
last Astonished, that you have all this while no more Considered 'em.

Condition of Power and Glory?

A. Yes. It is written, Dan 7 23, 26. The Fourth Beast, shall be the Fourth
Kingdom upon Earth; but the Judgment shall Sit, and they shall take away his
Dominion, to Consume, and to Destroy it unto the End. And the Kingdom, and
Dominion, and the Greatness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, shall be
given to the People of the Saints of the most High. And again, Mic 4 8 Even the
First Dominion, the Kingdom shall come to the Daughter of Jerusalem.

Q. Will our Lord Messiah, then make His Descent from Heaven, in Heavenly
Glory, and come to the Eternal Judgment of the World?

A. Yes. It is written, Dan 7 9, 10. I beheld, until the Thrones were pitched
down, and the Ancient of Days did Sit, whose Garment was white as Snow, and
the Hair of His Head like the pure Wool; His Throne was like the Fiery Flame,
and His Wheels as Burning Fire. A Fiery Stream issued, and came forth from
before Him; Thousands of Thousands Ministered unto Him, and Ten Thousand Times
Ten Thousand stood before Him; the Judgment was Set, and the Books were opened.

Q Shall there be a Resurrection of the Dead, at the Descent of our Lord
Messiah?

A. Yes. It is written, Isa. 26.19. Thy Dead shall Live, as my Dead Body shall
they arise; Awake and Sing ye who dwell in the Dust; for thy Dew, is as the Dew
of Herbs, and the Earth shall cast out the Dead.

Q. After the Resurrection of the Dead, shall the Raised Saints, Eternally Live
and Shine with the Lord Messiah, while Others are Damned unto Eternal Confusion?

A. Yes. It is written, Dan. 12.1, 2, 3. There shall be a Time of Trouble, such
as never was, since there was a Nation, even to that same Time. And many from
being Sleepers in the Dust of the Earth, shall Awake; some to Everlasting Life,
and some to Shame and Everlasting Contempt. And they that be wise, shall Shine
as the Brightness of the Firmament, and they that Turn many to Righteousness,
as the Stars for ever and ever.

THE END.
