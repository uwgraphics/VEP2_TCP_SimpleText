The ^^ouds stood upright as an heap

9 The foe said* I Will pursue, I Will catch*
I will the spoil dispose.
My lust on them shall filled be*
my sword draw out will I,
My hand shall them again possess,
or stroy them utterly*
10 Thou with thy wind did on them blow,
the Sea them covered:
They in the mighty waters sunck,
as if they had been lead.
(2)
11 LORD who is like thee among the Gods*
who is like thee* glorious
In holiness, fearful in praise,
in doings m^rvelous!

In mount of thine inheritance
O LORD the place wherein

LORD which thy hands established
18 Jehovah he shall reign

for ever Sovereign.
19 For Pharaohs horse, and charrots his*
and horsemen down they went;
Into the Sea, Jehovah then
the Sea upon them sent:
The waters of the Sea on them
he turned back in have
But on dry land in midst of Sea
the sonns of Israel past*
Miri^ms Answer.
21 Sing to the LORD for he excells

He has the horse, and cavallier
into the Sea cast down.
The Prophetical Song of Moses. Deuteronomy 32.
O^ heavens give ye attentive ear*
^o what I shall declare:
And also thou O earth shall hear,
what my mouths sayings are*
2 My doctrine like the rain shall drop
my speech distill shall as
The dew ^as ^ain on tender heaths.
and like the showers on grass.
3 Because that I Jehovahs name
will publish all abroad:
See that ye greatness atribute
therefore unto our God.
4 That ROCK his work most perfect is:
for's ways all judgment be:
A God of truth* an^ without sin,
both just and right is he.
5 But they defiled them selves, their spot
is not his childrens stain*
A crooked generation they
and froward do remain.
6 O foolish people and unwise*
the LORD thus pay do ye*
Thy Father that th^e bought, and made*
and stablisht is not he*
7 Remember days of old, the years
of every age mark well;
Thy father ask* and he will thee show:
thine elders will thee tell.
8 When as the highest shared their lots
unto the nations.
When as the separation he
did make of Adams sons:
The borders of the people he
did set where they should dwell:
According to the number of
the sonns of Israel.
9 Because Jehovahs portion
his chosen people be.
The lot of his inheritance
Jacobs posterity.
10 He found him in a desert ^and*
and in the vast deserts cry:
He led him round, him taught* him kept
as the apple of his ey.
11 As the eagle stirs up her nest*
and ^l^tters over her young*
Spreads out her wings* and takes them up*
bears them her wings upon.
12 Even in such wise Jehovah led
him up and down alone:
A (...) God ^lso with him
(...) any one.
13 (...) pl^ces of the earth
^
^
^
14 (...)
^
He from y^ flinty rock likewise
did make him oil to take.
14 On butter thou of kine* and on
the milk of sheep did feed:
With fat of lambs, and goats, and rams*
that were of Bashans breed:
Together with the fatness of
the wheaten kidneies fi^e:
Thou of ye grapes did also drink
the blood, refined wine.
(2)
^^ But Je^urun then waxed fat
and wantonly did kick:
Thou art grown fat* thou gross art gro^^
art closed with fatness thick.
Then he forsook the mighty God*
who had him mag^^^^'d
The Rock of his salvation
he also vilifi'd.
16. They with strange Gods his jealousy
did kind^e as a (...):
And with abominations
they did provoke his ire*
1^ They did to divills not to God
their sacrifices there.
To Go^s unknown, new up-startes, whom
your fath^rs did not fear.
18 T^^ ROCK who thee begotten has
ten (...) have thou not:
The ^^ghty God who formed thee
(...) forgot.
19 And this Jehovah (...)* and he
dispising them did lo^th.
Because of the provo^king of
his sons and daughters (...)
20 He said I Will (...) from them
what is their and I Will see:
For they a very froward race,
they faithless children be^.
21 With that which is no God they have
me moved to jealousy*
The have provoaked me to wrath
with Idols (...):
With what is no people I Will provoak
them unto jealousy:
Them with a foolish nation
to anger move will I*
(3)
22 For fire (...) in (...) wrath
shall b^rn to hell below:
And wast the earth with her increas
hills bottoms free also.
23 I mischiefs will upon them heap.
^^ine arrows on them spend:
With hunger burnt, with he^^ devo^^^.
with bitter plagues them end.
24 The ^^eth of cruel beasts I will
upon them send also:
The poison of the serpents too
which on the (...) do go.
25 The sword without and (...) within*
young men and maids bereave:
Which neither shall ye sucking babe*
nor hoar^e headed leave.
26 And into corners, I did say
that I would scatter them:
I Will their remembrance make to ceas
from amongst the sons of men.
27 But yt I feared their enemies wrath:
their foes there it would strange*
And say our high hand not y^ LORD
it is, wrought all this change.
28 For they are a Nation counselless
nor understanding find.
29 O^ were they wise: this understood!
their latter end would mind!
30 How should one chase a thousand, two
ten thous^nd put to flight*
Had not their Rock them sold and them
Jehovah shut up quite.
31 Because their Rock unto our ROCK
^s no^ to be compared:
Yea though our enemies themselves
as ju^ges should be heard.
32 For their Vine is of Sodoms Vine*
and of Gomorrahs field:
Their (...) of g^ll, to them
they bitter clusters yield.
33 Their wi^e as Dragons poison is*
(...) Adders cruel ^^ll.
34 Is not this stored with me, and se^ld
amongst my treasures all:
(4)
35 Vengeance is mine and recompen^e
in time their foot shall slide:
For their woe-day is nigh and soon
mishaps shall them be-tide.
36 Because ye LORD his folk shall judge*
for's servants too repent:
When none shut up or left he sees*
and that their power is spent.
37 And he shall say those Gods of theirs*
now where become are they:
Where is ye Rock, on whom they did
their expectation stay?
38 Which (...) their sacrifices fat.
dr^nk their wine-off^ings too*
Let them arise, help you and be
a hiding place for you.
39 See now that I* even I am he
and there is no God with me:
I kill and quicken, wound, and heal,
none from my h^nd c^n free.
40 For I to heaven lift mine han^:
and s^y I live for ^ve.
41 If my bright sword I where and if
my hand on judgment st^y:
I Will render vengeance to my (...)*
I Will (...)
42 I Will m^ke mine (...) with blood

For blood of sl^in and of them that

upon the enemy.
43 Sing joyfully ye Nations, with
those that his people be;
Because that of his servants all
revenge y^ blood will he*
And to his adversaries be
will ^^nder vengeance due
And he will mercy to his land
and to his people show.
THE SONG OF DEBORAH AND BARAK. Judge: 5. Then Sang Deborah and Barak the Son of
A^^^oam on that day Saying.
IN that he Israel has revenged
bless ye therefore ye LORD.
(...) that the people offered
themselves of free accord.
3 Give ear ^ Kings, ye Princes hear*
sing to the LORD I will:
I even I Will sing to the LORD,
the God of Israel.
4 LORD when thou we^^st from S^i^, when thou
did (...) field:
The earth did (...)* y^ heavens did drop.
the (...) distild.
5 Before y^ presence ^f ye LORD
(...) melting fell:
Even (...) y^ LORD
the God of Israel.
6 In days of Sh^mgar Anaths son
high ways in J^els days
Untrodden were; the passengers
did travel through by-ways*
7 The villagers did cease to be*
they ceased in Israel;
Till that I Deborah* rose I rose
a moth'r in Israel.
8 New Gods they chose, then wars arose*
and in ye gates have been:
Amongst forty thousand Israelites
was shield, or spear then seen?
9 My heart to Isreal's Rulers is,
that did of free accord,
Present themselves amongst ye folk:
bless ye therefore the Lord.
10 Speak ye your minds, all ye yt do
upon white asses ride:
Ye that in judgment (...), and ye
that walk the way beside.
11 Who from ye archers noi^e were freed
there (...) they now record.
In p^^ces where they waters (...)
the just acts of y^ LORD.
His rightous acts to them that dwell
in Isr^els towns (...):
Then (...) the people of y^ LORD
go down unto the (...).
(2)
12 Wake, wake, (...), wake awake
a song sing: Barak (...)
Abinoams son, and captive lead
thou thy captivityes.
13 Unto y^ remnant he gave rule
above the Nobles then.
Amongst ye folk the LORD gave me
rule over mighty m^n.
14 From out of Ephraim a root,
against Amalek there was:
Thy followers O Benjamin,
amongst thy folk did pass.
From out of Machi^ governors
descended also then:
And out of Zebulon came they
that handle writers pen.
15 And Issachar* even Issachar
his peers with Deborah went:
And also Barak was on foot
into the valley sent,
Because of those divisions that
in Reuben did appear,
Full many great impressions
of heart amongst us were.
16 Why did thou amongst ye sheepfolds stay
the ble^ting flocks to he^r
For Reuben his divisions*
heart searchings great there were.
17 Gil^^d by Jordan (...) why
(...) in ships reside*
On (...)
and in his (...).
18 Both Zebulun* and Nephthali
^ people that did yield.
Their lives in danger unto death
upon the open field.
(3)
19 The Kings came and they fought then fought
the Kings of Canaan*
In Taanach by Migiddo's streams:
no money* gain they wan.
20 From heaven they fought, y^ stars by course
did fight against Sis^ra.
21 Then Kishons brook, old Kisho^s brook
that brook them swept away.
O thou my soul have trod down strength.
22 Then broke their horse hoofs were.
By plunging pransings, pransings of
their mighty horses there.
23 Curse Meroz, curse her dwellers, curse*
Jehovahs Angel said:
For they came not to aid the LORD*
against might ye LORD to aid.
24 Jael y^ Kenite Hebers wife
'bove women blessed shall be:
Above the women in the tent,
a blessed one is she.
25 He water asked, she gave him milk*
in Lordly dish she fetched
26 Him butter forth; unto ye nail
she forth her left hand stretched.
Her right hand to ye workmans maul,
and Sisera hammered:
She peirc't and struck his temples through
and then cut off his head.
27 He at her feet bowed, fell, lay down,
he at her feet bowed where
He fell; whereas he bowed down*
he fell destroyed there.
(4)
28 Out of a window Sisera
his mother looked, and said,
The lat^ess through, in coming why
so long's his chariot staid:
His charrets wheels, why tarry they:
29 Her wise dames answered;
Yea she turned answer to her self,
30 And what have they not sped:
The prey by poll a maid or twain
what parted have not they:
Have they not parted Sisera
a party colored prey:
A party colored nield-work prey
of nield-work on each side,
That Is party colloured, meet for necks
of them y^ spoils divide:
31 So perish let thine enemies all
O LORD: but let each wight
That do him love be like ye Sun
that goes out in his might.
THE SONG OF HANNAH 1 Samuel: 2. And Hannah prayed and s^id
MY heart does in Jehovah joy*
my horn in Jah is lift on high:
My mouth enlarged is over my foe:
For in thy health rejoice do I.
2 Like to ye LORD there is holy none:
Because there is none else but thee:
And other rock there is not one.
That to our God compared may be.
3 Speak ye out no presumpteous word,
No harshnes from your mouth proceed.
For God of knowledge is ye LORD
Also by him are actions weighed.
4 The strong men's bows are shivered
And they yt slipped are girt with might:
5 The full have hired themselves for bread
And ceased has ye hungry wight.
So that ye barren seven bare.
The fruitful woman* weak is grown.
6 The LORD does kill, and life does spar^
He lifts up and to grave brings down.
7 The LORD both poor and rich does make
He raises up, and brings low.
8 The poor he up from dust does take.
The beggar life's the dunghill fro:
To give them place with princely lords
To make them heirs of glories throne:
For the earths foundatio^s are the LORDS
And he has set the world thereon.
9 His holy ones their feet he will
I reserve so* that they shall not fall:
The vile in darkness shall be still.
For no man shall by strength prevail.
10 The adversaries of the LORD
Shall broken be to pieces small.
And he from heaven shall accord.
To thunder forth upon them all.
The borders of the earth the LORD
Shall justly judge and he likewise
Unto his King shall strength afford:
And make his Ointeds horn to rise.
David's Elegy: 2 Samuel 1.17. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul
and ^ver Jonathan his son.
19 UPon thy places high is slain
the flower of Israel.
How are the mighty fallen down.
20 In Gath this never tell.
Nor shew't in streets of Askelon,
lest Philistines rejoice:
Lest daughters of th'uncircumciz'd
should make triumphant noise.
21 Ye mountains high of Gilboah
let there be never dew.
Nor rain, nor fields of offerings,
let ever be on you.
For there the mighty one his shield
received disgraceful foil,
The shield of Saul as he had not
anointed been with oil:
22 The bow of Jon'than did not turn
back from the blood o'th slain*
From fat o'th mighty, and Saul's sword
did not return in vain.
23 Most lovely Saul and Jonathan*
and pleasant did abide.
While they did live, and in their death
them nothing did divide.
They swifter then the Eagles were.
they Lions did excel,
24 In strength* O weep ye over Saul
daughters of Israel:
(...) did in Scarlet you array*
with deckings manifold:
Who did on your apparel lay
The ornaments of gold.
25 In midst of the battle how
the mighty fallen lie*
O Jonathan cut off wast thou
upon thy places high*
26 O thou my brother Jonathan
I am distressed for thee:
A loving kind, companion
thou have been unto me:
Thy love to me in wonder past
the love of women far.
27 How are the mighty fallen and w^st
the weapons be of war!
THE BOOK OF PSALMS
PSALM. I.
O Blessed man yt walks not in
the advice of wicked men
Nor stands in ye sin^ers way
nor scorners seat sits in*
But he upon Jehovah's law
does set his whole delight
And in his law does meditate
both in the day and night.
3 He shall be like a planted tree
by water brooks, which shall
In his due season yield his fruit,
whose leaf shall never fall:
And all he does shall prosper well.
4 The wicked are not so:
But they are like unto the chaff*
which wind drives too and fro.
5 Therefore shall not ungodly men
in judgment stand upright*
Not in the assembly of ^he just
shall stand the sinful wight.
6 For of the righteous men, the LORD
acknowledges the way:
Wher^s the way of wicked men
shall utterly decay.
PSALM: II.
WHy rage the heathen furiously*
vain things the people muse:
2 Kings of ye earth do set themselves
and Princes plotting use.
With one consent against the LORD.
against his Christ also.
3 Let us assunder break their bands.
and their cords from us throw.
4 He that in heaven sire shall laugh*
the LORD deride them shall.
5 Then to them in his ire he will speak*
in's wrath sore vex them all.
6 But I anoint my King upon
Zion my holy hill.
7 The counsel that established i^
declare abroad I will.
The LORD to me said. Thou'^t my son.
this day I thee begot.
8 Ask thou of me* and I will give
the heathen for thy lot:
And of the (...) thou shall possess
(...) abroad.
9 Thou shall (...) potters (...)
and (...) with non (...).
10 And now ye Kings be wise, be learned
ye Judges of the earth ( H^ar.)
11 Serve ye the LORD with reverence*
rejoice with trembling fear.
12 Kis ye the Son, le^^ he be wroth*
and ye fall in the way.
When his wrath but a little burn^:
blessed all that on him stay.
PSALM: III. A Psalm of David when he ^^ed from the face of Absalom his s^n.
O LORD my foes how great are they*
How many up against me stand*
2 No help is to my soul* they say,
In God for him at any hand.
3 My shield and glory yet art thou,
LORD, and th'up-(...) of my head.
4 I with my voice to All called, who
(...) holy (...) me answered. Selah
5 I laid down, slept, and wake did I*

PSALM: IV. To the chief musician on Negi^^th, a Psalm of David.
GOD of my justice when I call
O hear me; when distressed
Thou have enlarged me* show me grace,
and hear thou my request.
2 Ye sons of men my glory turn
to shame how long will you?
How long will ye love vanity
and still deceit pursue? Selah
3 But know ye LORD has set apart
for him his gracious saint:
The LORD will hear when unto him
I pour out my complaint.
* 4 Be stirred up; but do not ^inn
consider seriously
Within your heart, with silence deep
when on your bed you lie.
5 The sacrifice of righteousness
^et sacrificed be;
And confidently put your trust
upon the LORD do ye.
6 Many (...) say, O who
will (...) good to see?
The light, LORD, of thy countenance
let on us lifted be.
7 Thou have per gladness in my hear^
^more then the time wherein,
Their corn and their new wine also
have much increased bin*
8 In peace with him I will lie down
and I my sleep will take:
For me in confidence to dwell
thou LORD alone do make.
PSALM: V. To the chief musician on Nehiloth A Psalm of David.
JEHOVAH to my words give ea^,
my meditation weigh.
My King my God my cries voice hea^*
for I to thee will pray.
3 Thou in the morn my voice shall hear
LORD in the morning I
Will unto thee direct my prayer
and will look up on high.
4 For thou art not a God that will
in wickedness delight:
Nor shall with thee dwell any ill.
5 Nor fools stand in thy ^ight:
Craf^^men (...) sin thou (...) them.
6 Thou shall him stroy that (...):
The LORD will loath the b^oo^y men
and them that guile devise.
7 But I will to thy house draw (...)
in thine abundant grace*
And I will worship in thy fear
toward thy holy p^^ce.
8 Conduct me in thy righteousness
by reason of my spies;
O LORD thy ways most streight-express
also before mine eyes.
9 For in their mouth no faith they have
their inward parts are wrong:
Their throat is as an open grave,
they flatter with their ^ongue.
10 O God make thou them wholly wast*
them from their plots let fall:
Out i^ their ^^aps of sin them cast.
for against thee ^^et they all.
11 But let all joy that trust in thee*
shout ever let the same:
For thou defend'st them: glad let be
in thee that love thy name.
12 For thou LORD will thy blessing yield
unto the righteous one:
And (...) with a shield
with acceptance.
Second Meeter.
O LORD give ear to what I say,
My meditation understand.
2 (...) King* my God to thee I pr^y.
Voice of my cry do thou (...).
3 My voice the morning time within.
O thou Jehovah shall it hear:
I will to thee in the morning time
Address, and will mine eyes up-rear.
4 For you are a God have no delight
In ^in; nor ill dwell with thee shall.
5 Fools shall not stand before thy fight.
Who mischief work, thou hat'st them all.
6 Thou will bring to destruction quite*
Them that do lying falsehood pra^e:
The man of blood, and of deceit,
Jehovah will abominate.
7 But in thy many mercies (...)
Enter into thy house will I:
I in thy fear my self will bow
Before thy house of sanctity.
8 Because of mine observing spies.
Lead me forth in thy righteousness:
Before my face thy way likewise
Do thou Jehovah streight-express.
9 For in their month no truth they have.
Their inward part iniquities:
Their thro^^ (...) open grave*
Their tongue is smooth with flatteries.
10 O God make thou them wholly wast.
From their own plots let them fall (...):
Out in th^^ heaps of sin them cast.
For they against thee rebell^ ^re.
11 Let them who trust in thee repose.
Rejoice and ever shouting be,
For thou defendst them: yea let those
That love thy name be glad in thee.
12 Because JEHOVAH thou will yield
A blessing to the righteous one:
And wilt him crown as with a shield*
With gracious acceptance.
PSALM: VI. To the chief musician on Neginoth upon sheminith a Psalm of David.
LORD in thy wrath rebuke me not
Nor in thy hot wrath chasten me.
2 LORD pity me for I am weak,
LORD heal me for my bones vexed be.
3 Also my soul is vexed sore:
How long LORD will thou me forsake.
4 Return O LORD my soul relea^e.

All things thou have under his feet

To the chief musician upon (...). A Psalm of David.
LORD I Will thee praise withal my heart

2 I will be glad and joy in thee:
most high I Will sing thy name.
3 In turning back, my foes they will fall;
and perish at thy fight.
4 For thou maintainst my right and cause:
in throne fit'st judging right.
5 Thou have the heathen folk rebukt
and wicked ones destroyed:
For ever and for evermore*
thou have their names made void.
6 Destructions (O thou foe) are come
to end perpetual:
Thou have stroy'd cities* they are gone
with their memorial.
7 Nevertheless Jehovah shall
for evermore endure:
And unto judgment he his throne
prepared has most sure.
8 And he the habitable world
shall judge in righteousness:
Unto the people judgment give
he shall in uprightness.
9 A refuge for oppressed on^s.
Jehovah shall become:
A refuge high he is to them
in seasons troublesome.
10 They also that do know thy Name
in thee will put their trust:
For them that do thee seek O LORD,
forsake thou never do.

With workers of unrighteousness.
That peace unto their neighbors say.
But in their hearts is wickedness.
4 Give thou to them like to their works

Give them like to their handy-works'
And render unto them their meed^.
5 Because unto Jehovahs work
They did not wise attention yield:
Neither unto his handy work.
He will them wast, and not up-build.
6 The LORD be blessed, for heard has he
The voice of my request for grace.
The LORD's my strength, and shield to me*
My heart staid on him, helped I was.

9 O LORD, because distressed am I,
in mercy send relief*
My soul, my belly, and mine eye,
consumed are with grief.
10 Because my life with sorrow quails,
with sighs my years decay:
And for my sins, my vigor fayres,
my bones do pine away.
11 To all my foes a scorn am I,
chiefly my neighbors to:
A fear to friends, they that me spy,
without did flee me fro.
12 I as a dead man am forgot,
that is out of memory:
And like unto a broken pot,
even such an one ^m I.
13 Because that I of all the rout
the ^^^^indering did hear:
On every side me round about
there was a trembling fe^^.
While as that they against me did
together counsel take,
They craftily have purposed
my life away to make.
14 But O Jehovah upon the^

15 My times are in thy hand.
From the hands of mine enemies,

And from the hand of them likewise

16 Thy countenance to shine upon

O give to me salvation

Who fear and trust in thee before

From strife of tongues in cover^ place,
thou shall them safe^y hide.
21 O let Jehovah blessed be,
because he has made known*
His kindness wonderful to me,
within a fenced town.
22 For I in have said I am cast
out from before thine eye;
My suit for grace ye heard thou have*
when I to thee did cry.
23 O love the LORD all ye his saints,
the faithful he does guard;
But he unto proud doers grants,
a plentyfull reward.
24 See that encouraged you be,

All whosoever hopef^llie,

PSALM: XXXII. A Psalm of David, A (...).
OH blessed is the man to whom
trespass is pardoned,
And he to whom transgression
is wholly covered.
2 O blessed is the man, to whom
the LORD imputes not sin,
And he who such a spirit has
that guile is not therein.
3 My bones whilst I did silence keep
with age did wear away,
By reason of my roaring-cry*
continuing all the day.
4 For heavily thy hand did ly
upon me day and night:
That into summers scorching drought.
my moisture turned quite. Selah
5 My sinful trespass unto thee
I have acknowledged:
And my perverse iniquity,
I have not covered;
Against my self my sins, said I,
I Will to the LORD confess:
And then of mine iniquity
thou did the sin release. Selah
6 For this each godly one to thee
in finding times shall pr^y.
Sure^y, in fl^^ds of waters great,
come nigh him shall not they.
7 Thou ^rt my hiding place, thou shall
from trouble set me free;
Thou with songs o^ deliverance
shall ^ound encompass me* Se^ah
8 To thee I will instruction give.
teach thee likewise will I.
The way wherein thou should go*
I Will guide thee with mine eye.
9 Be ye not like the horse and mule,
which do not understand.
Whose mouths with bridle bit we rule.
to bring them to command.
10 To every one that wicked is
their sorrows do abound,
But him that on the LORD relies,
shall mercy compass round.
11 Be joyful in Jehovah ye,
ye righteous ones rejoice:
And all in heart that upright be
shout forth with cheerful voice.
PSALM: XXXIII.
YE just in GOD rejoice,
praise well th'upright does suit.
2 Praise GOD with harp with psaltery sing*
to him on ten string'd lute.
3 A new song sing to him,
aloud play skilfully?
4 Because Jehovahs word is right.
his works all verity.
9 He loves righteousness,
and also equity:
The earth is fully furni^^'t with
the LORDs benignity.
6 For by Jehov^hs word
the heavens had their frame.
And by the spirit of his mo^th
all th'armies of the same.
7 The waters of the seas,
^he gathers as an heap:
Together as in storehouses,
he ^ayeth up the deep.
8 All men throughout the earth,
let them Jehovah fear:
Let all the dwellers of the world
unto him reverence bear.
9 Because he did but speak
the word* and it was made;
He did give out commandment,
and it was firmly staid.
10 The LORD does bring to naught,
the h^^thens counsel wise:
He makes to be of none effect,
what people do devise.
11 The counsel of the LORD
abide for ever (...),
The cogitations of his heart
to generations all,
(2)
12 O blessed nation,
whose God Jehovah is:
And people whom (...),
he chosen (...).
13 The LORD from heav^n look ^s,
all sons of men views well.
14 Look from his dwelling place does he,
to all on earth that dwell.
15 The hearts of every one
alike he does them frame.
And all their operations
he well does mind the same.
16 By multitude of hosts
no King himself does save,
Nor yet by multitude of strength
they strong deliverance have.
17 A horse a vain thing is
to be a savior,
Nor shall he work deliverance
by greatness of his power.
18 On them that do him fear*
lo, is Jehovahs ey:
Upon them that do place their hope,
on his benignity.
19 To save alive in dearth,
their soul from death to free.
20 Our soul does for Jehovah wait,
our help and shield is he.
21 For our heart joys in him,
in's holy name trust we:
Thy mercy LORD let be on us,
like as we trust in thee.
PSALM: XXXIIII A P^alm of David when he changed his behavior before Abimelech,
who drove him away and he departed.
I Will the LORD in seasons all
bless in humility,
And in my mouth his praises shall
abide continually.
2 My soul shall in Jehovah make
with joy her boasting cheer,
The humble shall great pleasure take
when they hereof shall hear.
3 With me together O do ye
Jehovah magnify,
And let us ^ll herin agree
to lift his name on high.
4 When I Jehovah sought unto,
then he to me gave ear:
He me delivered also,
from all that was my fear.
5 * They looked to him and lightened were
no shame did them appall.
6 This poor m^n cried, the LORD did hear
and saved from troubles all.
7 The LORD his Angel every where
incamp^th round about:
Each one of them that do him fear,
from ill to free them out.
8 How bountiful Jehovah is.
O taste and see likewise:
O great is that man's blessedness.
whose trust on him relies!
9 Oh see that ye Jehovah fear
his holy ones that be,
Because that such as do him fear*
no want at all shall see.
10 Young Lions they are brought to want,
and suffer lack of food:
But they that fear the LORD no want
shall have of any good.
(2)
11 Oh come ye children unto me,
give you attentive ear:
And I will you instruct how ye
the LORD aright shall fear.
12 Who is the man whose heart is bent
that long his life may be,
Who loves days, and has intent
prosperity to see.
13 Thy tongue from ill, thy lips also
from speaking guile keep thou.
14 Depart from evil, and do good,
seek peace and it pursue.
15 Upon the men that righteous are,
the LORD does set his eye:
And likewise he does bow his ear
when unto him they cry.
16 Iehovahs face is set against
them that do wickedly,
That he of them from off the land
may cut the memory,
17 When as the righteous men do cry,
the LORD does hear their call:
And gives to them delivery
out of their troubles all.
18 Jehovah near is such unto
as broken hearted be:
Whose spirit contrite is also.
even such ones save will he.
19 The just man's grie^^ ^re many a one,
from all GOD sets him free:
He keeps all his bones, that non^
of them should broken be.
21 Evil shall slay the wicked men,
and whosoever hate
The righteous man, even all of them
shall sure be desolate.
22 Their souls that do Jehovah serve.
he freely does redeem:
Nor utterly shall any swerve,
that put their trust in him.
PSALM: XXXV. A Psalm of David.
PLead LORD with them yt with me plead.
Against them fight, that fight with me.

From him that is for him too strong.

As one that for his mother wept.

And they together gathered weer.
Yea th'^bjects against me gathered be:

17 Oh LORD how long will thou look on
My soul from their destruction free:
My darling free from Lions set:
18 So will I give thee thanks always.
Within the congregation great,
Among'st much people I Will thee pr^yse.

LORD do not far from me withdraw.
23 Arise and to my judgment wake*
My God and LORD unto my plea.
24 LORD judge me for thy justice sake,
My God least over me joy should they.
25 Let them not say their hearts within,
Aha* our souls desire have we:
Now have we quite up swallowed him*
Oh let them never say of me.
26 Shamed let the^^ and confounded be,
At once, who at my hurt are glad;
Let such as boast themselves against me
With shame and with disgrace be clad.
27 Let them be glad and shout for joy
That favor do my righteous cause:
Yea let them say continually.
Extolled be the LORD with praise,
Who in his servants faring well
Does his delightful pleasure take.
28 So shall my tongue thy justice tell*
And of thy praise all d^y shall speak.

And of the rivers of thy joys

9* For wi^h thee is the spring of life,

O stretch thy loving kindness forth

10 To them that upright are in heart*

PSALM: XXXVII. A Psalm of David.
F^e^ not thy self, because of them,
that evil workers be*
Nor envious be against the men
that work iniquity.
2 For even like unto the grass
cut quickly down are they:
And like unto the tender herb,
they wither shall away.
3 Upon Jehovah put thy trust
and be thou doing good:
So shall thou dwell within the land,
and faith shall be thy food.
4 See that thou set thy hearts delight
also upon the LORD;
And then the wishes of thy heart
to thee he will afford.
5 Roll on the LORD thy way trust him*
and he will it bring to pass.
6 As light thy justice he will bring forth,
thy judgment as noon days.
7 ^est in Jehovah, and for him
with patience do thou stay:
Fret not thy self because of him
who prospe^^ in his way;
Nor at the man, who brings to pass
the crafts he does devise.
8 Cease ire, and wrath leave, to do ill
thy self fret in no wife.
9 For evil doers shall be made
by cutting down to fall*
But those that wayt upon the LORD.
the land inherit shall.
(2)
10 For yet a little while and then
the wicked shall not be:
Yea thou shall diligently mark
his place, and it not see.
11 But humble men the inheritance
shall of the earth possess.
Also they shall themselves delight
in multitude of peace.
12 The wicked plotts against the just,
gnashing at him his teeth.
13 The LORD shall laugh at him, because sword
his day at hand he sees.
14 The wicked have drawn out their
and bent their bow have they,
To cast the poor and needy down.
to kill th'upright in way.
15 Their sword shall enter their own heart
their bows shall broken be.
16 The just man's little better is.
then wickeds treasury.
17 For the arms of wicked shall be broke:
the LORD the just does stay.
18 The LORD does know upright men's d^yes,
and their lot is for ay.
19 They never shall ashamed be,
in any time of ill:
And when the days of famine come,
then shall they have their fill.
20 But wicked men Jehovah's foes,
as lambs fat shall decay;
They shall consume; yea into smoke
they shall consume away.
(3)
21 The man ungodly borrow does,
and never does rep^y:
Whereas the just man mercy shows,
and freely gives away.
22 For such as of him blessed be,
the earth inheri^ shall:
And they that of him cursed are,
^y cutting down shall fall.
23 The footsteps of a godly man,
a^e ordered ^ight:
Even by the LORD, and also he
does in his way delight*
24 Although he fall yet shall be not
be utterly down cast.
Because Jehovah with his hand
does yet uphold him fast.
25 I have been young, and now an old.
yet have I never seen.
The just man left, so that his seed;
for bread have beggars been.
26 But every day he is merciful
and sends: ^his seed is blessed.
27 Depart from evil, and do good.
and ever dwell at rest.
28 Because the LORD does judgment love
his saints forsakes not he:
Kept ever are they; but cut off
the sinners seed shall be.
29 The just inherit shall the land,
and therein ever dwell.
30 The just man's mouth does wisdom speak
his tongue does judgment tell.
31 The Law of his God is in's heart,
none of his steps shall stray.
32 The wicked watches for the just,
and seeks him to slay.

PSALM XLII. To the (...).
^
^
Even in such wise, O God, my soul,
after thee panting looks.
2 For God, even for the living God,
my soul it thirsts sore:
Oh when shall I come and appear,
the face of God before!
3 My tears have been unto me meat,
by night and eke by day:
While all day long they unto me,
where is thy God? do s^y.
4 When as unto my memory,
these things recall I do,
Then I pour out my soul in me,
for I with troops did go:
With them unto Gods house I went,
with voice of joy and praise:
I with a multitude did go,
that did keep holy days.
5 My soul why art cast down? and why
stird in me? thy hope place
In God, for praise him yet shall I,
for health is in his face.
(2)
6 My God, my soul in mee's cast down;
therefore thee mind I will:
From Jordans land, and Hermonites,
and from the little Hill.
7 At sounding of thy water spouts,
deep unto deep does call:
Thy wa^es pass over me, and eke
thy breaking billows all.
8 His loving kindness yet the LORD
command will in the day:
And in the night his song's with me,
to God, my life; I Will pray.
9 I Will say to God, my rock, O why
have thou forgotten me?
For pressure of the enemy,
why should I mourning be?
10 As with a sword within my bones,
mine enemies me upbraid:
While all the day, where is thy God?
they unto me have said.
11 My soul O wherefore do thou bow
thy self down heavily;
And wherefore in me make thou
a stir tumultuously?
Hope thou in God, because I shall
with praise him yet advance:
Who is my God, he also is
he^lth of my countenance.
PSALM: XLIII.
Judge me O God, and plead my cause,
from nation merciless;
Both from the man of guile and wrong,
O send thou me redress.
2 For (...) my strength thou ar^ the God,
why (...) thee (...)?
Why (...) for the sore
(...) of the sea?
3 O send thou forth thy light and truth,
let them lead and being me,
Unto thy holy hill, and where ^
thy tabernacles be.
4 Then will I to Gods Altar go,
to God my cheerful joy:
Yea thee to praise O God my God.
I will my harp employ.
5 My soul O wherefore do thou bow
thy self down heavil^?
And wherefore (...) make thou
^ stir tumultuously?
Hope thou in God, because I shall
with praise him yet advance:
Who is my God, he also is
health of my countenance.
PSALM: XLIIII. To the chief mus^cian for the sonns of Korah Maschil.
We with our ears have heard. O God
our fathers have us told:
What works thou wroughtest in their days
even in the times of old.
2 How thy hand drove the heathen out.
and planted them thou have:
How thou the people did afflict,
and out thou did them cast.
3 For by their sword they did not get.
the lands possession:
Nor was it their own arm that did
work their salvation:
But thy right hand, thine arm also,
thy countenances light*
Because that of thine own good will
thou did in them delight.
4 Thou ar^ my King, O mighty God*
thou (...) the some (...):
For Jacob be commandment
deliverances procure.
5 Through thee as with an horn we will
push down our enemies:
We through thy Name will tread them down
that up against us rise.
6 Because it is not in my bow,
that I affiance have:
Nor is it any sword of mine,
that shall at all me save.
7 But thou ^^st from our foes us saved,
and ^arers put to sh^me.
8 In God we all d^y-long do boast,
and praise for ay thy Name.
(2)
9 But now thou have forsaken us,
and shame upon us c^st:
Nor with our Military troops,
gone forth to battle have.
10 Back from before the enemy
thou ^ak'st us to recoyl:
They also that our haters be,
do for themselves us spoil.
11 Thou have us given, like as sheep,
to slaughter that belong:
Thou have us also scattered,
the heathen folk among.
12 Thou do thy people set to sale
for that which is no gain:
And by their prices no increase
of riches do obtain.
13 Unto our neighbors a reproach,
even us thou do expose:
A scorn we are and mocking stock,
to them that us enclose.
14 Among the heathen people thou
a byword do us make:
Also among the Nations,
at us their Heads they shake.
15 Before mine eyes continually
abides my disgrace:
And likewise with confounding shame,
o're-covered is my face.
16 By reason of the scorners voice.
who does with sc^ffs despite:
By reason of the enemy,
and self-revenging wight.
(3)
17 Though all of this be come on us,
we have not thee forgot:
Likewise against thy covenant,
(...) have we not.
18 Our he^rt is not turned back, nor have
our steps from thy way strayed*
19 Though us thou break'st in (...) place
and hid'st us in deaths shade.
20 Had we forgot Gods Name* or ^o
a strange god stretched our hands*
21 Shall not God search it (...)
hearts secrets understands,
22 Yea we* for thee, are all day killed:
counted as sheep to slay.
23 Awake why sleep'st thou LORD ^^ise
cast us not of^ for ay.
24 Thy countenance away from us
O wherefore do thou hide?
Why do thou mindless of our grief,
and sore distress abide.
25 For down to dust our soul is bowed,
to the earth our bellies cleave.
26 O thou that art out help arise,
in mercy us relieve.
PSALM: XLV. To the chief musician upon Shoshannim for the s^nns of Korah,

3 Thy wasting sword O mighty one,

4 Ride forth upon the word of truth,
meekness and righteousness:
And thy right hand shall lead thee forth,
in works of dreadfullness.
* 5 Thine arrows sharp: the people they
shall fall down under thee,
Yea in the heart (they shall fall down)
foes to the King that be.
6 Thy throne's O God for ever and aye,
the Scepter of thy state
A scepter is of righteousness.
7 Thou wickedness do hate,
And love justice, God therefore,
thy God has oynted thee,
With oil of gladness them above,
that thy companions be.
8 Myrh, Aloes, and Cassia's sm^ll,

11 So in thy beauty to delight
the King he shall accord;
And bowing down him worship thou,
because he is thy LORD.
12 Thou shall be present with a gift
the daughter there of Tire:
The rich amongst the people they
thy favor shall desire.
13 The daughter of the King she is
all glorious within:
And with imbroyderies of gold.
her garments wrought have bin.
14 She is led in unto the King,
in robes with nedle-wrought:
Her fellow Virgins following her,
shall unto thee be brought.
15 With gladness forth they shall be brought
also with joyfulness.
So to the palace of the King,
they entering have access.
16 In their stead who thy fathers were,
thy (...) they shall be:
Whom thou may place in all the earth,
in Princely (...).
17 Thy Name remembered I will make
through generations all:
Therefore for ever and for aye,
the people praise thee shall.
To the chief musician, for the sonns of Korah A song upon Alem^th.
GOD is our refuge strength and shield,
in troubles very near.
2 Therefore we will not be afraid,
though the earth removed were:
Though mountains move to midst of Seas.
3 Though waters roaring make,
And troubled be, though at their waves,
the mountains trembling shake.
4 There is a River, streams whereof,
make glad the City of God:
The holy place where the most high
does settle his abode.
5 God is within the midst of her,
be moved shall not she:
When early morning does appear
God shall her helper be.
6 The n^tions made tumultuous noise,
the Kingdoms moved were:
He did give forth his thundering voice,
the earth did melt with fear.
7 The God of armies is with us,
the everlasting J^h:
The God of J^^ob is for us,
a refuge high, Selah.
8 O come ye forth behold the works,
(...) which (...):
The fearful desolations,
which on the earth he brought.
6 Unto the utmost ends of th'e^rth,
wars into peace he turns:
The spear he cuts, the bow he breaks,
in fire the chariot burns.
10 Be still and know that I am God,
exalted be will I,
Among the heathen: through the earth
I Will be extolled high.
11 The God of Armies is with us,
the everlasting Jah:
The God of Jacob is for us,
a refuge high Selah.

PSALM: XLVIII. To the chief musician, A song and psalm for the sonns of Korah.
GReat is Jehovah, greatly he
is to be praised still:
Within the City of our God,
within his holy hill.
2 Mount Sion's fairly situate,
the joy of the earth so wide:
The City of the mighty King,
is on the Northern side.
3 God in her palaces is known,
to be a refuge high.
4 For lo the Kings assembled were,
they past together by.
5 They saw and so they marvieled
they greatly troubled were,
They also hasted fast away.
6 Fear felt upon them there,
As on a woman travailing,
they such a pain did find.
7 In pieces thou the Tarshish ships,
do break with Eastern wind.
(2)
8 In The City of the LORD of hoasts,
we saw as we heard say:
In The City of our God, God will
establish it for ay.
8 O God our thoughts have been upon
thy free benignity:
And that within the midst of
thy house of Sanctity.
10 According to thy Name O God.
so is thy praise unto.
Th'ends of the earth, thy right hand's full
of righteousness also.
11 O let mount Sion joyful be!
and triumph let them make:
They that of Judah daughters are,
even for thy judgments sake.
12 About the hill of Sion walk,
and go about her ye;
And do ye reckon up thereof
the towers that therein be.
13 Do ye full well her bulwarks mark,
her palaces view well:
That to the generation
to come, ye may it tell.
14 Because this God he is our God,
for ever, and for ^y:
And he will be ^ guide to us,
even to our ^ying day.
PSALM: XLIX. To the chief mus^cian, A Psalm for (...) Kor^h.
HEar this all people and give ear,
all in the world that dwell.
2 Sonns both of low and higher men,
the rich the poor as well.
3 I with my mouth variety
of wisdom will imp^rt:
Of understanding much shall be
the musings of my heart.
4 Unto a speech proverbiall,
I will incline mine ear:
I will upon the Ha^p withal,
my doctrine dark declare.
5 Why should I be at all afraid,
in d^yes that evil be?
When that my heels iniquity,
about shall comp^ss me.
(2)
6 Those men that make their great estates
their st^y to ^rust unto:
Who in the plenty of their wealth
themselves do boast ^lso.
7 There Is not a m^n of them that can
^y any means redeem
His (...), nor to God can give
^ ransom meet for him.
8 So dear their souls redemption is,
and ever cease it.
9 That he should still for ever live,
and never s^e the pit.
10 For he does see that wise men die,
the fool, and brutish too:
Do perish, and their rich estate,
to others leave they do.
11 They think their houses are for ay,
to generations all:
Their dwelling places, and their lands
they by their names do call.
12 But man in honor being set;
abides not a night:
But he becomes like unto
the beasts that perish quite.
13 This way of theirs their folly is;
yet their posterity*
Delighting in that which they say,
approve it vehemently.
14 Like sheen so are they laid in grave,
death shall them feed upon;
And th'upright over them in the morn
shall have dominion:
And from the pl^ce whereas they dwell,
the beauty which they have.
Shall utterly consume away,
within the rotting grave.
15 But surely God redemption
unto my soul will give*
Even from the graves prevailing power, Selah
for he will me receive.
(3)
16 Be not afraid when as a man,
in wealth is made to grow.
And when the glory of his house,
abundantly does flow.
17 For when as he does come to die,
naught shall he take away:
Nor shall there after him descend,
his glorious array.
18 Although in his life time, his soul
for blessed he did take:
And men will praise thee when as thou
much of thy self do make.
19 He shall go to his fathers race,
they never shall see light:
In honor man and knows not, is
like beasts that perish quite.
PSALM L. A Psalm of As^ph.

a storm of wondrous might.
4 To judge his people he from high,
calls heavens and earth likewise.
5 Bring me my saints that covenant make
with me by sacrifice.
6 And the heavens shall his righteousness,
apparently make known:
Because the mighty God himself,
is righteous judge alone.
7 Hear O my people, and I Will speak*
yea I will testify:
Also to thee O Israel,
I even thy God am I.
8 As for thy sacrifices I
will find no fault with thee:
Or thy burnt offerings to have been,
continually with me.
9 I Will take no bullocks nor he-goats,
from house or fields of thine.
10 For forrest-beasts, and cattle all,
on thousand hills ^re mine.
11 The ^owls that on the mountains (...)*
all of them do I know:
And wild-beas^s, in the fiel^s (...),
they a^e with me also.
12 If I were hung^y I would not
it unto thee declare*
For mine the habitable world,
and fullness of it are.
13 Of bullocks eat the flesh, or drink
the blood of goats will I?
14 Thanks offer unto God and pay
thy vows to him most high.
15 And in the day of sore distress,
do thou unto him cry:
And I Will deliver thee, and then
thou shall me glorify.
(2)
16 But to the wicked God does say,
why do thou mention make*
Of statutes mine, why in thy mouth,
should thou my covenant take?
17 Whereas thou do instruction hate,
and my words from thee cast.
18 When thou did see a thief with him
then thou consented have:
And likewise with adulterers,
thy part has been the same.
19 Thy mouth to evil thou do give;
and guile thy tongue does frame.
20 Thou sit down, and so against
thy brother do declaime:
The son of thine own mother thou
with slander do defame.
21 Th^se things thou did. I silent was*
(...) thought^t of me likewise,
(...) thy self; I Will thee reproove.
and rank them in thine eyes.
22 Now therefore this consider ye,
that God forgotten have:
Left that in pieces I you tear,
and there be none to save.
23 Who so does praises sacrifice,
he glorifieth me:
Who orders right his way likewise,
shall Gods salvation see.
PSALM: LI. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David when Nathan the Prophet came
to him after he had gone in to Bathsheba.
HAve mercy upon me O God,
according to thy grace:
According to thy mercyes great,
my trespasses deface.
2 O wash me thoroughly from my guilt,
and from my sin me clear.
3 For I my trespass know, my sins
before me still appear.
4 Against thee, thee only I have sinned,
this ill done thee before:
When thou speak (...), and (...)
wh^^ thou do (...) therefore.
5 (...),
I (...):
Also (...),
in sinned (...).
6 Behold thou do desire the truth,
within the inward part:
And thou shall make me wisdom know,
in secret of my heart.
7 With Hysop do me purify,
I shall be cleansed so:
O wash thou me, and then shall I
be whiter then the snow.
8 Of joy and gladness make thou me,
to hear again the voice:
That so the bones which thou have broke
may cheerfully rejoice.
9 From the beholding of my sin,
hide thou away thy face:
And eke all mine iniquities,
O do thou clean deface.
(2)
10 Clean heart O God in me create,
also a spirit right,
11 In me renew. O cast me not
away out of thy sight.
12 Nor from me take thy holy Spirit.
restore the joy to me
Of thy salvation, and uphold
me with thy Spirit free.
13 Then will I teach thy ways to those
that work iniquity:
And by this means shall sinners be
converted unto thee.
14 O God, God of my health set me
free from blood-guiltiness:
And so my tongue shall joyfully,
sing of thy righteousness.
15 LORD open thou my lips, and forth
my mouth thy praise shall show.
16 For thou desir'st not sacrifice,
I would it else bestow,
Burnt offerings thou delights not in.
17 Of God the sacrifice,
A broken spirit, a contrite heart
God thou will not despise.
18 In thy good pleasure O do good
unto thy Sion hill:
The walls of thy Jerusalem,
O do thou build up still.
19 The sacrifice of justice shall
please thee with burnt offering.
And whole burnt offering; then they shall
calves to thine Altar bring.
A^ other M^^ter.
O God h^ve mercy upon me,
According to thy kindness dear:
And (...) thy mercies many be,
O do thou my tran^gre^s^^ns clear.
2 From my perve^sness with me through,
And from my (...) purifye.
3 For my (...) I do know,
My sin is still before mine eye.
4 Against thee, thee only sinned have I,
And done this evil in thy sight:
That when thou speak thou just may be
And when thou judge cleared quite.
5 Behold, perverse iniquity*
Was that estate I shaped was in:
My mother that c^ncerned me.
Even she did me conceive in sin.
6 Behold, it is the truth that thou
Desire in the inward part:
And thou shall make me wisdom know,
Within the secret of my heart.
7 O from my sin me purify
With hysop, clean I shall be so:
O wash thou me, and so shall I,
In whiteness go beyond the snow.
(2)
8 Of joy fullness and gladness make
Thou me to hear again the voice;
That so the bones which erst thou brake,
Again they gladly may rejoice.
9 Hide from my sins thy face apart,
Blot out all mine iniquities.
10 O God creat in me clean heart:
In me renew right spirit likewise.
11 Cast me not out from thee before,
Nor from me take thy spirit away.
12 Me thy salvations joy restore;
And me with thy free spirit stay.
23 Thy (...) transgressors teach I will,
And sinners shall be turned to thee.
^4 O God, God of my safety still,

PSALM: LII. To the chief (...) Mas^h^l, A Psalm of David: when Doeg the Edo^^te
(...) and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Abimelech.
O Man of might wherefore (...)
thus (...) thy self (...)
The goodness of the Mighty God,
endures ever still.
2 Thy tongue injurious mischief does
presumpteously devise:
And like unto a rasor sharp,
it works deceitful lies.
3 Thou love evil more then good,
more to speak lies then right.
4 O guilefull tongue thou do in all
devouring words delight.
5 God shall likewise for evermore.
destroying thee deface:
He shall thee take away, and pluck
thee from thy dwelling place.
Out of the land of th'living ones.
he also will root thee. Selah
6 The just shall fear and laugh at him,
when they this thing shall see.
7 Lo, this man made not God his strength
but put his trust upon.
His store of wealth: he strengthened was,
in his transgression.
8 But in the house of God am I,
like as an Olive green:
In Gods benignity for ay,
and ay my trust has been.
9 Because that thou this thing have done,
I Will praise thee evermore:
And on thy name will wayt, for this
is good thy saints before.
PSALM: LIII. To the chief musician upon Mahalath Masch^l; A Psalm of David.
THe fool in's heart says there is no God
they are corrupt each one,
Abominable sin they do:
that does good there is none.
2 God from the heavens looked down*
on sonns of men to see,
If any that does understand
that seeks God there be.
3 They altogether filthy are,
each one is backward gone:
There is not any that does good,
no not so much as one.
4 The workers of iniquities,
have they no knowledge all?
Who eat my people even as bread,
on God they do not call.
5 They greatly feared where no fear was:
against thee in camp that lies
His bones God scattered, and them shamed
for God does them despise.
6 O who is he that graciously
to Israel will fulfill,
His manifold salvations*
from out of Sion hill?
When God his people shall return,
that have been captive led:
Then Jacob shall therein rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.
To the chief musician ^n Neginoth* (...), A Ps^lm of David, when the Ziphims
came and said to Saul does not David hide himself with us.
SAve thou me by thy Name O God,
and judge me by thy power.
2 God hear my prayer, hark to the words
that from my mouth I pour:
3 For strangers up against me rise,
and who oppress me sore,
Pursue my soul: the mighty God
they set not them before. Selah
4 Lo God's mine help, the LORD's with them
that do my soul sustain.
5 He to my foes shall ill reward:
them in thy truth restrain.
9 I will unto thee sacrifice,
with voluntaryness:
I will thy Name confess O LORD,
because that good it is.
7 For he has me delivered,
out of all miseries:
And its desire mine eye has seen,
upon mine enemies.
PSALM: LV. To the chief (...) M^schil; A Psalm of David.
O God do thou give (...)
my supplication:
And hide not thou thy self away,
from my petition.
2 O be attentive unto me,
and answer me return:
I in my meditation,
do make a noise and mourn.
3 By reason of the enemies voice,
and vile one that oppressed:
For wickedness on me they cast,
and me in wrath detest.
4 Mine heart in me is pained sore,
death's terrors me surprise.
5 Trembling and fear do on me come,
and horror on me seize.
6 Then did I say, O who to me
wings of a dove will give!
That I might f^^ away* and might
in quiet dwelli^^ live.
7 Lo then far often I wander would,
and in the des^r^ stay. Selah
8 Soon from the storm and wind I would,
and tempest escape away.
(2)
9 O LORD on them destruction bring,
do thou their tongues divide:
For strife and violen^^ I within
the City have espide.
10 About it on the walls thereof,
they walk both n^ght and day:
Mischief also and sorrow d^e,
in midst of it stay.
11 In midst thereof there is wickedness.
deceit does there abide:
Likewise out of the streets thereof,
guile turns not aside.
12 For It was no foe reproached me.
I could it then abide:
Nor did my hater vaunt over me,
from him I could me hide.
13 But thou it was the man that were
my well esteemed peer:
Which wast to me my special guide,
and mine aquaintance near.
14 We did together counsel take,
in sweet society:
And we did walk into the house
of God in company.
15 Let death seiz on them, and let them
sink down quick into hell:
For wickedness amongst them is,
in places where they dwell.
(3)
16 But as for me, I Will call on God,
and me the LORD save shall.
17 At evening, morn, and noon I Will pray
and I aloud will call,
And he also will hear my voice.
18 Who has my soul set free
In peace, from w^r^, that was against me,
for many were with me.
19 God shall both hear, and them afflict,
who does of old abide. Selah
Because that they no changes have,
Gods fear they lay aside.
20 Against such as be at peace with him,
he has put forth his hand:
He also has the covenant,
which he had made profand.
21 Whilst war was in his heart, more smooth
then butter were his words,
His words more soft then any oyl^
but yet they were drawn swords.
22 Thy burden on Jehovah cast,
and he support thee shall:
He will not give the righteous man,
to be removed at all.
23 Thou God shall bring them down to hell
the men of blood who be:
And guile, shall not live half their days,
but I will trust in thee.
PSALM: LVI. To the chief musician upon Ionath Elem Rech^kim, M^^htam, of David,
when the Philistims took him in Gath.
O God upon me mercy have,
for man would swallow me:
He fights against me all the day.
oppress me sore does he.
2 Through out the day mine enemies
to swallow ^ee devise:
Who fight^ng (...) me O most high,
they many are likewise.
3 I Will put my t^ust in thee always,
when (...) I am afraid:
4 And (...) God his word will praise,
in God my trust is staid:
For nothing b^ afraid I will,
that flesh can do to me,
5 All day they wrest my words for ill:
against me their thoughts all be.
6 Themselves together they combine,
themselves they closely hide:
Because they watch this soul of mine,
in to my steps they pri'de.
7 What shall they thus escape away,
by their unrighteousness:
O God in wrath without delay,
the people down depress.
8 Of all my wanderings to and fro,
thou have the reckoning took:
My tears thy bottle put into,
are they not in thy book?
9 Then shall mine enemies turn back,
when I do cry to thee:
This know I ma^^ured-wise*
that God will be (...).
10 In God I Will (...) the word.
^
In God (...)
what man can do me ill.
12 O God upon me are thy vows,
I Will render praise to thee.
13 Because that thou my soul from death
have set at liberty:
And wilt not thou also my feet
from falling set them free?
That I fore God may walk in the light
of them that living be.
PSALM: LVII. To the chief musician Al-taschith Mictam of David, when he fled
from Saul in the cave
O God to me be merciful,
be merciful to me;
Because my soul for shelter safe,
betakes it self to thee:
Yea in the shadow of thy wings,
my refuge I have placed,
Until these sore calamities,
shall quite be over-past.
2 To God most high I cry: the God
that does for me perform.
3 He will from heaven send, and save
me from the spiteful scorn*
Of him that would with greedy have
me swallow utterly;
God will send forth his mercy kind
and (...) his verity.
4 My soul amongst the Lions is,
I fire brands ly among:
Men's sonns whose ^eeth are spears and dar^*
and as sharp swords their tongue.
5 Above the heavens hight do thou
exalt thy self O God:
O let thy glory be extolled,
over all the earth abroad.
6 They for my steps prepared a net,
my soul is bowed down:
They dig'd a pit for me, but they
in midst thereof are thrown. Selah
7 My heart prepared is O God,
my heart prepared is:
Sing will I, and sing praise with psalm^.
Up O my glory rise*
Awake both Psaltery, and Harp:
my self I Will early w^ke.
9 Among the people LORD to thee
I will confession make.
10 Among the Nations I Will thee praise,
for thy benignity
Is great, to heaven, thy truth likewise
does reach the cloudy sky.
11 Above the heavens hight do thou,
exalt thy self O God:
O let thy glory be extolled,
(...) all the earth abroad.
PSALM: LVIII. To the chief musician Altaschith Michtam of David.
Do ye O congregation
speak righteousness indeed*
In judgment do ye sonns of men,
with uprightness proceed?
2 Yea you injurious wickedness
in heart, will working be:
The weight of your hands violence,
weigh out in the land do you.
3 The wicked are estranged (...),

And even from the belly they
their falsehood do display*
4 Even like a serpents (...)

They ^re like as the Adder^^*

5 Who will not hearken to the voic^
of such as charmers are:
Although the charmer in his charms
none of his cunning spare.
6 With in then mouth do thou their teeth
break out, O God most strong:
Do thou O LORD the mighty teeth
break of the Lions young
7 As waters let them melt* way,
continually that flee:
And when he bends his (...) let them
as ^ut assunder be.
8 As melts a snail, let every one
of them away so run,
Like women's timeless birth; that they
may never see the Sun.
9 Before your pots can feel the thorns*
so shall he them surprise,
As with a whirlewind; both alive,
and in most wrathful wise
10 The righteous shall rejoice, when as
he does the vengeance see;
He shall his feet wash in the blood.
of them that wicked be.
11 So men shall say assuredly
there is for the righteous fruit:
Sure there is a God that in the earth,
does judgment execute.
PSALM: LIX. To the chief musician Alt^sc^ith Michtam of David, when Saul sent
and they watched the house to kill him.
MY God from them deliver me,
that are mine enemies:
Set thou me up on high from them
that up against me rise.
2 From them that painful-wickedness,
do work deliverance:
And be to me a Savior,
from such as bloody be.
3 For lo they for my soul lay wait;
the mighty men combine
Against me, not for my trespass LORD,
nor any sin of mine.
4 Without iniquity in me,
they run and ready make
Themselves: do thou behold, also
unto my help awake.
5 LORD God of hoasts, thou Isreal's God
to visit rise therefore
All heathens; who sin wickedly
to them show grace no more. Selah.
6 At evening back they do return,
they utter such a sound
As does a dog, and so they go
About the City round.
7 Behold they beltch out with their mouths
with in their lips are swords:
For who is he that does us hear?
these are their very words.
8 But thou O LORD wilt laugh at them,
and all the heathens mock.
9 And for his strength I Will wait on thee*
because God is my rock.
(2)
10 The God of my benignity,
with good prevent shall me;
God shall give me upon my foes
my full desire to see..
11 Them stay not lest my folk forget,
but scatter them apart,
By thy strong power; and bring them down,
our shield and LORD who art.
12 For their mouths sin, and their lips words
and in their pride them take:
And for their cursing, and their lies,
which in their speech they make.
13 Consume thou them, in wrath consume
and let them be no more:
So they that God in Jacob rules,
shall know the earth all over. Selah
14 And they at evening shall return
a noise as dogs shall make:
And so about the City round,
a compass they shall take.
15 And they shall wander up and down,
to seek what they may eat:
And if they be not satisfied,
then shall they grudg thereat.
16 But I will sing thy power; and shout,
thy kindness in the morn:
For thou my tower and refuge art,
when as I am forlorn.
17 A psalm of praise I will sing forth,
O thou my strength to thee:
For God is mine high tower, the God
of mercy mine is he.
PSALM: LX. To the chief musician upon Sha^^hen Sdu^^ Michtam of David, to to^ch
when he strove with Aram Naharaim, and with Aram Zobah^ when Joab returned and
sm^te of (...) in the valley of salt, twelve thousand.
O God thou have rejected us,
and scattered us abroad;
Thou have displeased been with us,
return to us O God.
2 The land to tremble thou have caused.
thou it assunder brake:
Do thou the breaches of it heal,
for it does moving shake.
3 Thou have thy people caused to see,
things that are hard to bear:
And thou have caused them to drink,
the wine of trembling fe^r.
4 But thou bestowed have on them,
a banner who thee fear:
That it on high before the truth
di^playe^ may appear. Selah.
5 That those that thy beloved are
may be delivered free:
O do thou save with thy right hand,
and answer give to me.
6 God in his Holyn^ss (...) spoke,

See (...) the vale

Ephraim the strength is of my head.
Judah my Laws prescribes.
8 Mo^b my wash-pot is, I will
over Edom cast my shoo:
O Palestine because of me
be thou triumphant too.
9 O who is it that will me bring
into the City strong?
And into Edom who is he
that will me lead along?
10 Is it not thou O God who did,
us cast away thee fro?
And thou O God who would not
forth with our armies go?
11 From trouble give unto us help,
for help of man is vain:
Through God we will do great acts; he shall
our foes tread with disdain.
PSALM: LXI. To the ^hi^f mus^cian upon (...) of D^vid.
GIve ear O God unto my cry,

Lead (...) rock

4 Within thy Tabernacle I,
for ever will abide;
Within the covert of thy wings,
I Will seek my self to hide. Selah
5 For thou O God have heard the vows,
that I to thee have past:
The heritage to them that fear
thy name, thou given have.
6 Unto the King his days there shall
be added days by thee:
His years as generation,
and generation be.
7 In presence of the mighty God.
he shall abide for ay:
Benignity and truth prepare,
that him preserve they may.
8 So then will I for evermore,
unto thy Name sing praise:
That I the vows that I have made.
perform may all my days.
PSALM: LXII. To the chief musician to Iedu^^un, A Psalm of David.
TRuly my waiting soul relyes
in silence God upon,
^^cause from him there does arise
all my salvation.
2 He only is my Rock, and he
salvation is to me:
And he is my defense that I,
moved greatly shall not be.
3 How long against a man will ye
plot mischief? you shall f^ll*
All as tottering fence you be,
and like a bowing w^ll.
4 His exellence yet to suppress,
they counsel do impart:
They lies do love, with mouth they bless,
but curse within their heart. Selah
5 My soul wait thou on God alone,
my hopes on him abide.
6 My Rock and safety he alone,
my Towr, I shall not slide.
7 On God does my salvation,
and glory make abode;
The rock of my munition,
my refuge is in God.
8 Ye people upon him O see
you put your trust always:
Pour out your heart before him ye,
God is our hopeful stay. Selah.
9 Sure base men's sonns are vanity,
and high men's sonns a ly:
When jointly ^hey in balance lie,
more light then vanity.
10 In robbery be not vain, nor yet
trust in oppression:
If wealth increase yet do not set
your hearts de^ight thereon.
11 Once spoken has the God of might,
this word once and again,
I plainly heard that powrfull-might,
does unto God pertain.
12 Also to thee benignity,
O LORD does appertain:
For even as his work shall be,
thou rendrest man again.
PSALM: LXIII. A Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
O God thou art my God, I will
betime for thee enquire:
My soul does thirst for thee, thee still
my flesh does much desire.
In The land whereas no waters be,
that thirsty is and dry.
2 As in thine house I saw, to see,
thy strength and Majesty.
3 Because thy loving kindness more
in goodness does excel
Then life it self: my lips therefore,
thy praises forth shall tell.
4 Thus I Will thee bless continually,
whilst that alive I am:
And I these hands of mine on high,
will lif^ up in thy name.
5 So as with marrow, and with f^t^,
my soul shall filled be:
With joyful lips my mouth also
shall tender praise to thee.
6 When thee I to remembrance call*
as on my bed I lie*
In watches of the night withal
when on thee muse do I.
7 Because thou art my help, I will
rejoice in thy wings shade.
8 My soul cleaves close unto thee still:
thy right hand has me staid.
9 But they that seek my soul to wast,
down under earth shall go.
10 Slain by the sword, they shall be cast
a part the foxes to.
11 Yet shall the King in God rejoice,
all they that by him swear*
Shall likewise glory, but their mouth
be stopped that lies declare.
PSALM: LXIIII. To the chief musician A Psalm of David.
O God when I my prayer make,
my voice then do thou hear:
Also do thou preserve my life
(...) from the enemies fe^r.
2 From secret plotts of wicked men,
(...) me in secrecy:
From th'in^^rection of all them,
that work iniquity.
3 Who have their tongue so sharply whet
as if it were a sword:
And bend their bows to shoot their shafts,
a very bitter word.
4 That they in secrecy may shoot
the perfect man to hit;
They suddenly do shoot at him,
nor are afraid of it.
5 Themselves they in a matter ill,
encourage how they may
Lay snares in secret: it is their talk
who shall them see? they say.
6 They do search out iniquity,
a search exact they keep:
The inward thought of every man,
and heart is also deep.
7 But God shall shoot at them a shaft;
their wounds be sudden shall.
8 So as they shall their own tongue make
upon themselves to fall.
All that them see away shall flee.
9 All men shall fear and tell
The works of God, for of his deed
they shall consider well.
10 The just shall in the LORD be glad,
and trust in him he shall:
And they that upright ar^ in heart,
in him shall glory all.
PSALM: LXV. To the chief musician, A Psalm and Song of David.
SIlence to thee: the praise O God,
in Sion* paid shall be
2 The vow to thee. Who hear prayers
all flesh shall come to thee.
3 Works of iniquity prevail
against me sore do they:
But as for our transgressions,
thou shall them purge away.
4 O blessed is the man of whom
thou thy free choice do make,
And that he may dwell in thy courts
him near to thee do take:
For with the good things of thy house
be satisfied shall we,
And with the holy things likewise
that in thy Temple be.
5 In righteousness thou by the things
that dreadfully are done,
Wilt answer give to us, O God
of our salvation:
On whom the end^ of all the earth
do consi^tently stay,
And likewise they that are removed
(...) off upon the sea.
6 He g^rt with might, does by his strength
(...) does swage
7 The noise of seas, noise of their waves
also the peoples rage.
(2)
8 Who in the utmost parts do dwell,
they at thy tokens quake:
The morns outgoings and the nights
thou to rejoice do make*
9 Thou visit'st the earth, and warrest it.
with Gods flood water-fill'd,
Thou makst it rich: thou corn preparst.
when so thou have it tilled.
10 Herridges richly waterest thou,
her furrows thou sets fast:
With showers thou makst it soft to be,
her springing blessed thou have.
11 Thou with thy goodness do the year*
a-dorn as with a crown:
Also the paths where thou do tread
they f^tness do drop down.
12 On pastures of the wilderness
they dropping do distill:
And girt with joy on every side
is every little hill.
13 The pastures clothed are with stocks,
corn over-covering
The valleys is, so that for joy
they shout and also sing.
PSALM: LXVI. To the chief musician, A Song or Psalm.
O All ye Nations unto God
a noise triumphant raise.
2 Sing forth the honor of his name:
make glorious his praise.
3 How dreadful in thy works art thou?
thus unto God say ye,
Through greatness of thy might, thy foes
shall yield themselves to thee.
4 All they to thee shall bow themselves

And sing unto thee, they shall sing
unto thy name with mirth.
5 Come hither and the works of God Selah.
which he has wrought O see:
In doing to the sonns of men
how terrible is he!
6 He did the Sea to dry land turn:
a way thereby they had
On foot to pass the river through,
there we in him were glad.
7 He rules by his power for aye,
his eyes the nations spy:
Let not those that rebellious are
lift up themselves on high. Selah.
8 Ye people bless our God, and make
his pr^yses voice be heard,
9 Which holds our soul in life, and he
lets not our feet be stirred.
10 For God thou have us proved, thou have
us tried, as silvar's t^^de,
11 Into the net brought us thou have,
on our loins straitness tied
12 Men over our heads thou madst to ride,
through fire and water pass
Did we: but us thou brought into
a place that wealthy was.
13 With offerings I Will go to thine house,
my vows I Will pay to thee.
14 Which my lips uttered, and mouth spoke,
when trouble was on me.
15 Burnt offerings I will offer thee.
that full of fatness are,
Of Rams the incense; bullocks eke
with goats I will prepare. Selah
16 Come hither harken unto me,
all ye that God do fear:
And what he has done for my soul,
to you I will declare.
17 With mouth I cried to him, and with
my tongue extolled was he.
18 If in my heart I sin regard,
the LORD will not hear me.
19 But now assuredly God has
vouchsafed me to hear:
He to my supplications voice.
did give attentive ear.
20 O blessed be the mighty God,
because my prayer has he
Not turned away: nor yet his own
benignity from me.
To the chief musician on Negin^th, A Psalm or Song.
GOD gracious be to us and gi^^
his blessing us unto,
Let him upon us make to shine
his countenance also.
2 That there may be the knowledge of Selah
thy way, the earth upon,
And also of thy saving health
in every nation.
3 O God let thee the people praise,
let people all praise thee.
4 O let the nations rejoice,
and glad O let them be:
For judgment th^^ with righteousness
shall give thy folk unto;
The nations that are on the earth
thou shall them lead also.
5 O God let thee the people praise,
let people all praise thee.
6 Her fruit abundant by the earth
shall then forth yielded be.
7 God even our own God, shall us bless
God bless us surely shall:
And of the earth the utmost coasts
they shall him reverence all.
PSALM: LXVIII. To the chi^f musician on Neginoth, A Psa^m or Song.
LEt God arise, his enemies
let them dispersed be:
Let them also that do him hate,
away before him free.
2 Like as the smoke away is driven,
so drive thou them away:
As wax at fire melts, wicked so
let in Gods sight decay.
3 But let the righteous ones be glad.
O let them joyful be:
Before Gods face let them also,
rejoice exceedingly.
4 To God, sing, to his name sing praise,
that rides on the skies,
Extol ye him by his name Jah:
before him joy likewise.
5 A father of the fatherless,
and of the widows case
God is a judge; and that within
his holy dwelling place.
6 God seats in house the desolate,
those that in chains are bound
He frees; but those that rebels are,
dwell in a barren ground.
(2)
7 O God when as thou did go forth,
in presence of thy folk:
When through the desert wilderness
in marching thou did walk. Selah.
^ The earth did at Gods presence shake:
from heavens the drops down fell:
Sinai it self did move before
the God of Israel.
9 O God that on thy heritage,
did send a plenteous rain*
Whereby when as it weary was,
thou it confirm'dst again.
10 Thy congregation dwelt therein:
thou did O God prepare
Of thy benignity* for them
that poor afflicted are.
11 The LORD ye word gave, great's their troop
that have it published.
12 She that at home stayed parts the spoil,
when Kings of hoasts fled, fled.
13 Though ye have lien among the pots*
like doves wings be shall ye:
With silvar decked, her feathers eke
with yellow gold that be.
14 When there The Almighty scattred Kings
it was white as Salmons snow.
15 Gods hill like Bashan hill, high hill,
like Bashan hill unto.
16 Why do ye leap ye lofty hills?
this is the very hill,
In which God loves to dwell, the LORD
dwell in it ever will.
(3)
17 Gods charriots, twice ten thousand fold
thousands of Angels be;
With them as in his holy place,
on Sinai's mount is he.
18 Thou did ascend on high, thou ledst
captivity captive,
For men, yea for rebellious ones,
thou did gifts receive.
19 That God the LORD might dwell with them
who daily does us load
With benefits, the LORD be blessed,
even our salvations God. Selah
20 The God he of salvation is,
that is our God most strong*
And to the LORD JEHOVAH does
issues from death belong.
21 But God shall wound the enemies head
the hairy scalp also,
Of him that in his trespasses
on forward still does go.
(4)
22 The LORD said I Will bring back again,
again from Bashan hill:
My people from the depths of seas
bring back again I will.
23 That thou may dip thy foot in blood,
thy dogs their tongues likewise,
May be imbrued in the same
blood of thine enemies.
24 They have thy goings seen O God.
thy goings in progress
Even of my God, my King, within
his place of holiness.
25 Before them did the singers go,
then they that play to song:
The D^msells that on Timbrells play
were them the midst among.
26 Within the congregation,
bless God in humble wise;
Even bless the LORD, who from ye spring
of Israel do arise.
27 There Is little Benjamin their chief,
there Judahs lords, and there
Their counsel, Lords of Zebulon,
and Naplithali there were.
28 The strength thou have, even by thy God
the same commanded was;
Confirm, O God, the thing which thou
for us have brought to pass.
(5)
29 For thy house at Jerusalem.
Kings shall bring gifts to thee.
30 Rebuke the troops of spearmen, troops
of bulls that mighty be:
With peoples calves, and him that does
with silvar pieces bow:
The people that themselves delight
in war, O scatter thou.
* 31 From Egypt there shall Princes come,
and th'Ethiopians land
Shall speedily unto the LORD,
reach her out-stre^ched hand.
32 Earths kingdoms sing ye un^o God:
unto the LORD sing praise. Selah.
33 To him that rides on heavens, of heavens
that were of ancient days.
Lo he his voice a strong voice gives.
34 To God ^scribe ye might,
His excellence over Israel is,
his strength is in the height.
35 Thou God art from thy Temple dread:
the God of Israel he
Gives strength, and to his people power,
O let God blessed be.
PSALM: LXIX. To the chief musician, upon Sh^shannim, A Psalm of David.
THe wa^ers in unto my soul

where I no standing have:
Into deep waters I am come,
where floods me overflow.

Mine eyes fail, for my God I wayt.
4 They that have hated me

They might ^e, then I restor^d,

5 O God thou know my foolishness,
my sin's not hid from thee.
6 Who w^yt on thee, Lord GOD of hoasts
let not be shamed for me:
O never suffer them who do
for thee inquiry make,
O God of Israel to be
confounded for my sake.
(2)
7 By reason that I for thy sake*
reproach have suffered:
Confusion my countenance,
has over-covered.
8 I as a stranger am become,
my brethren even unto.
(...) my mothers children I
an ali^nt am also.
9 For of thy house the fervent zeal
has quite up eaten me:
And on m^ their reproaches fell,
that have reproached thee.
10 In fasts I wept, and spent my soul,
this was reproach to me.
^^ And I my garment sackcloth made,
yet must their proverb be.
12 They that do sit within the gate,
against me speak they do;
Unto the drinkers of strong drink,
I was a song also.
13 Bu^ I in an accepted time,
to thee LORD, make my prayer:
O God me in thy saving truth,
and in much mercy hear.
(3)
14 Deliver me out of the (...),
and me from sinking keep:
Let me be freed mine haters from,
and out of waters deep.
15 O're-flow me let not water floods,
nor me let swallow up
The deep, and let not thou the pit,
her mouth upon me shu^t.
16 Jehovah, hear thou me, for good
is thy benignity:
After thy mercyes multitude,
O turn thy face to me.
17 And from thy servant hide not thou
thy countenance away:
Because that I in trouble am,
hear me without delay.
18 O draw thou nigh unto my soul.
redeem thou it likewise:
Deliver me, because of them
that are mine enemies.
19 Thou my reproach have known, also
my shame, and my disgrace:
Mine advarsaries every one,
they are before thy face.
(4)
20 Reproach mine heart has by (...) grieved
I sought some me to moa^^
But none there was: and sought for some
to comfort, but found none.
21 In stead morover of my meat,
they gave unto me gall.
They gave me vinegar to drink,
to quench my thirst withal.
22 Their table let before their face
to them become a snare,
And that let be a trap, which should
have been for their welfare.
23 Their eyes let darkened be likewise,
that they may never see;
With trembling also make their loins
to shake continually.
24 Pour out thine ire on them, let soi^
on them thine anger fell.
25 Their palace let be desolate:
none in their tents let dwell.
26 Because they do him persecute,
on whom thy stroke is found,
Also they talk unto the grief,
of them whom thou do wound.
27 Do thou to their iniquity,
iniquity more add:
Into thy righteousness for them
let entrance none be had.
28 Out of the book of living ones,
O do thou them forth blot:
And them amongst that righteous are
be written let them not.
(5)
29 But I, O God, am poor and sad:
let thy he^lth lift me high
30 With song I Will praise the name of God
with thanks him magnify.
31 Unto Jehovah this also
shall be more pleasing far.
Then any ox or bullock young,
that horned, and hoofed are.
32 This thing when as they shall behold,
then shall be glad the meek;
Also your heart shall ever live,
that after God do seek.
33 Because the LORD ye poor does hear,
nor's prisoners does despise:
Let heaven, earth, seas, him praise and all
that mo^es therein likewise.
35 For God will Judahs Cities build,
and Sion he will save:
That they may dwell therein, and may
it in possession have.
36 And of his servants then the seed
inherit shall the same:
Also therein inhabit shall
they that do love his name.

O cast me not away:
And do thou not abandon me*

10 For they that be mine enemies,
those men against me spoke,
Who for my soul lay-wayt likewise

11 They say God has him quite for-gone

And apprehend ye him, for none

13 Who my souls adversaries are
O let them be abash't:
Yea let them quite consumed be:

With foul disgrace, and in^^amie,

(3)
14 Howbeit I with patience still,

And more and more yet and I will,
to all the praise of thee.
15 My mouth shall forth thy righteousness,
and thy salvation show,
From day to d^y, for of the same

22 Also with timed psaltery
I will show forth thy praise.
O thou my God, sing forth will I

Thy faithfullness and verity,
O Isreal's holy one.
23 My lips rejoice with shouting shall.
when I to thee shall sing:
My soul which freely thou from thrall,

24 Likewise my tongue shall forth declare,
thy justice all day long:
Because that they confounded are,

PSALM: LXXII. A Psalm f^r Solomon
O God thy judgment give the King:
Thy justice likewise to his son.
2 Just judgment he thy folk shall bring:
And to thy poor see judgment done.
3 The mountains shall abundantly
Unto the people bring forth peace:
The little hills accordingly
By executing righteousness.
4 Poor of the people judge he shall,
And children of the needy save:
He shall to pieces break even all
Them that with fraud oppressed have.
5 They shall thee fear, while Sun and Moon
Endure through generations all.
6 Like rain on mourn grass he shall come
As show^rs on earth distilling-fall.
7 The j^st shall flourish in his days,
And store of peace till no moon be.
8 And from the Seas unto the seas,
From flood to lands end reign shall be.
9 They that dwell in the wilderness,
Themselves before him bow they must:
And they who are his enemies,
They verily shall lick the dust.

Of Tarshish, and the Isles the Kings:

THE THIRD BOOK OF PSALMS.
PSALM: LXXIII. A Psalm of Asaph.
SUre God is good to Israel:
even to the clean in heart.
2 But yet my feet had almost slipped*
my steps did well-nigh start.
3 For at the fools envious was:
to see lewd men in pe^ce.
4 For without bands through death they pass,
their strength does nothing cease.
5 Like other mean men they are not,
^n toylsom miseries:
Nor stricken with like plagues are they,
as other mortals be.
6 Pride therefore like a chain does sense,
them on each side about:
And like a garment violence
does cover them throughout.
7 Out of the fullness of their fate
extended are their eyes:
They do enjoy more prosperous state
then what their hearts devise.
8 Corrupt they are and wickedly
speak guile; they proudly talk.
Their mouth the heavens does defy,
their tongue through the earth does walk.
(2)
10 Therefore his people hitherto
do (...) themselves about;
And waters of their cup o're-flow,
that are to them wrung out.
11 And they have said how can it be
that God this thing should know.
Is there in him that is most high
hereof the knowledge too*
12 Behold the ungodly men are these,
yet have tranquillity:
They do within the world increase,
in rich abillity.
13 Sure I have washed my heart in vain,
and hands in innocence:
14 For every day I plag^'d have been,
each morn with chastizments.
15 If I should say that I will make
this declaration:
Lo of thy sonns I should offend
their generation.
16 When as I thought this thing to know
it was too hard for me.
17 Till I did to Gods Temple go
where I their end did see.
(3)
18 Surely in places slippery,
these men thou placed have:
To desolations suddenly*
thou do them also cast.
19 As in a moment how are they
brought to destruction*
And how are they con^^^^'d away,
with sad confusion?
20 Like to a dream, as when a man
awaking does arise.
When thou awak'st their Image then
O LORD thou shall despise.
21 My heart with grief was leavened so,
pricked were my reins in m^e.
22 So foolish I, and did not know:
like as a beast with thee.
(4)
23 Nevertheless continually.
before thee I do stand:
Thou have upheld me steadfastly,
also by my right hand.
24 Thou with thy prudent counsel shall
direction to me give;
Up afterward also thou shall,
to glory me receive.
25 In heaven above but thee alone,
who is it that I have?
And there is nothing the earth upon
beside thee that I crave.
26 This flesh of mine, also my heart
does fill me altogether:
The Mighty God he is my part,
and strength of heart for ever.
27 For lo, they that are far from thee.
shall utterly decay;
All that a who^^ng go from t^ee
thou shall consume away*
28 But as for me, it is good that I
near unto God repair:
I do on God the LORD rely,
thy works all to declare.

Nor with us any to be found

10 How long yet shall th'oppressing foe,
O Mighty God defame?
Thine enemy for evermore,
shall he blaspheme thy name?
11 Why do thou hold thine hand? pluck from

salvation 'midst the land.

3 The earth melts and its dwellers all,

4 I said unto the foolish ones,
deal not so foolishly:
Also unto the wicked ones,
lift not the horn on high.
5 Lift ye not up your horn on high;
with stifned neck speak not.
6 For from East, west^ or wilderness,
promotion is not got.
7 But God is judge: one he sets up,
another down does tread.
8 For in the LORDs hand is a cup,

Of mixture full, he poures therout:

ye people that are mine:
Unto the sayings of my mouth,
do you your ear incline.
2 My mouth I Will open in parables.
I Will speak things his of old:
Which we have heard and known; and which
our fathers have us told.
4 Them from their children we will not hide,
but show the age to come,
The LORD his praise; his strength and works
of wonder he has done.
5 In Jacob he a witness set,
a Law in Israel,
He gave, which he our fathers charged
they should their children tell.
6 That the age to come and children which
are to be born might know;
That they who should ^rise, the same
might to their children show.
7 That they upon the Mighty God
their confidence might set:
Gods works, and his commandments
might keep, and not forget.
8 And might not like their fathers be,
a cross, stiff race, a r^ce
That set not right their hearts; nor firm
with God their spirit was.
(2)
9 The armed ^o^ms of Ephr^im,
(...) with their bow,
Did turn their back the day wherein,
they did to battle go.
10 Gods covenant they observed not,
to walk in a Law ^eal'd.
11 His works and wo^den they forgot,
(...) to them prescribed.
12 He many a wondrous thing did work
before their (...) eyes,
Within the land of Egypt seen,
in (...) field lik^wise.
13 Assunder he the sea did (...),
and caused them through to pass:
And he the waters made to stand,
th^^ as an heap it was.
14 With cloud by day, with fire by night
15 (...) them* Rocks he clave,
In wilderness, as from great deeps,
drink unto them he gave,
16 Even from out of the stony rock
streams he did bring also,
And caused water to run down,
like as the rivers do.
(3)
17 Moreover they did add yet more
against him for to sin:
By their provoaking the most high
the wilderness within.
18 Morover they within their heart
by tempting God did tr^e,
By asking (...) for meat
their l^st to (...).
19 And spoke against the mighty God,
and said wh^^ is God (...),
Within the des^rt wilderness
to (...)?
20 Lo he the (...) thence,
(...) out, and stream^^ did flow*
Can he (...) people ^^esh provide?
^
21 The LORD heard, he was wrath for this,
so kindled wa^ a fire,
Against Jacob: and against Israel,
there come up wrathful (...).
22 For they in God believed not:
nor in his ^ealth did hope:
23 Though from above he charged the clouds
and doors of heaven set (...):
24 On them he Manna ^aind to eat;
and gave them heavens wheat.
25 Each man of them eat Angels food:
to the full he sent them meat.
26 In The heavens he made ye east wind blow
brought south wind by his power.
27 He flesh on them like dust: winged fowls
like sand of seas did shower.
28 And in the midst of their camp
he caused it to fall,
Even round about on every side
their dwelling places (...).
29 So they did eat they filled were
abundantly also:
For that which was their own desire,
he did on them bestow.
(4)
30 They from their hasting (...)
were not ^estrang'd at all,
But while their meat was in their mouth,
31 Gods wrath did on them (...),
And slew their fat on^^, and smo^e down
the choice of Isreal's men.
32 Yet for all this they sinned, nor did
believe his wonders then.
33 Therefore in vanity the days
^e of their life did spend:
And he their years brought hastily
unto a fearful end.
34 When he them flew, then after him
they sought with their desire,
And they returned and after God,
they early did enquire.
35 Likewise that God was their strong rock,
they called to memory:
And how that their redeemer was
the mighty God most high.
36 Yet with their mouth they flattered him
and to him their tongues ly'd.
37 For right their heart was not with him,
nor did in's covenant 'bide.
38 But full of mercy he forgave
their sin, and stroyd them not;
Yea often he turned his wrath aside,
nor raised all is anger hot.
39 For he recalled unto mind,
how that frayl flesh they were:
And as it were a passing wind,
that does no more appear.
(5)
40 How often in desert vexed the^ him,
and grief put him upon?
41 Yea they did turn, tempt God, and did
stint Isreal's holy one.
42 His hand they did not keep in mind,
nor on the day they thought,
Wherein he from the enemy
for them deliverance wrought.
43 How he his signs miraculous,
in Egypt wrought likewise:
And also in the field of Zo^n,
his fearful prodigies*
44 Also how he their rivers had
converted into blood*
And so as that they could not drink
the waters of the flood.
45 Amongst them which did them devo^^
he sent forth diverse flies:
And to destroy them, them amongst
he sent the frogs likewise.
46 He gave their fruit to th'catterpillars*
to Locusts eke their toil.
47 He did their vines destroy with hayl:
with frost their figtrees spoil.
48 Their cattle he delivered up
unto the hayl also;
And he their hea^ds of cattle (...)
hot thunderbolts unto.
49 He cast on them ^^erce ire* and wrath,
and indignation strong;
And sore distress, by sending forth
ill Angels them among.
50 He made a way unto his wrath,
their soul he did not save
From death, but unto pestilence,
their lively ones he gave.
51 He within Egypt land also
the first born all did smite:
Those that within the tents of (...)
were chiefest of their might.
(6)
52 ^ut like a flock of sheep ^e made
his people forth to go:
And in the desert like a flock,
he guided them also.
53 In safety he them led likewise.
so that they did not fear;
But in the sea their enemies,
he overwhelmed there.
54 The border of his holy place
them thereunto be brought:
Yea even to this mountain which,
by his right hand he bought.
55 Fore them he cast the heathen out,
he did their lot divide
By line; and Isr'els tribes he made
in their tents to abide*
(7)
56 Yet they did tempt, and bitterly
did grieve the God most high:
Also his Testimonies they
kept (...) attentively.
57 But like their fathers, back they turned
and faithlesness did show:
They turned were aside even like
unto a warping bow.
58 For the^r to anger did provo^k
him with their places high:
And with their graven Images,
mo^'d him to jealousy.
59 God hearing this, was wrath, and loathed
Israel with hatred great.
60 So Shiloah^ tent he left^ the rent
which he among men set.
61 And he delivered up his strength
into captivity:
Also into the enemies hand
his glorious Majesty.
62 To th'sword he gave his folk: and was
wroth with his heritage
63 Their young men fire devoured their maids
none gave in marriage.
64 Their Priests fell by the sword* likewise
their widows did no^ weep*
65 Thou did the LORD ^s one arise
aw^^ned out of sleep.
Like as a strong man (...)
66 does shout. He also smot
His foes (...) so gave he them
an everlasting (...).
(8)
67 Then he did Joseph's ^ent refuse*
nor Ephraims tribe approved.
68 But did the tribe of Judah choose:
mount Sion which he loved.
69 His holy place he builded then,
like palaces on high:
Like to the earth which he did set
to perpetuity.
70 He of his servant David then
di^ his election make,
And from the place of folding in
the sheep he did him take.
71 From following of ye ews with young.
he did him then advance:
His people Jacob for to feed,
Israel his heritance.
72 S^ he them fed according to
his hearts integrity:
And by his skilfullnes of hand
them led accordingly.
PSALM: LXXIX. A Psalm of Asaph.
O God the heathen entered have
thine heritance, and defiled
Thine holy Temple; they on heaps
Jerusalem have pil'd.
2 Thy (...) bodies that are dead,
they given have for meat
To th'fowls of heaven* to th'beasts of the earth
flesh of thy saints to eat.
3 Their blood they have forth poured round
about Jerusalem;
Like unto warers: and there was
none for to bury them.
4 To those that near unto us dwell
reproach become are we:
A scoffing and a scorn to them,
that round about (...) be.
5 How long Jehovah will thou still
continue in thine (...),
For ever (...) shall thy jealousy
burn forth like unto fire?
6 Upon the heathen pour thy wrath,
who never did thee know:
Upon the kingdoms that have not
called on thy name also.
7 Because they Jacob have devoured,
and they his dwelling place,
To utter desolation
did wonderfully raze.
(2)
8 Mind not against us former sins.
O let thy bowel^s have,
Us to prevent, because we are
near utterly laid wast.
9 God of our safety help thou us,
for the honor of (...):
Free us also, and purge away
our sin even for the (...).
10 Why say ye heathen where is their God?
Before their (...) to light,
The vengeance of thy saints blood (...),
and that before our ^ight.
11 Before thee ^et the prisoners (...)
come up, accordingly
As mighty (...) thine arm, save those
that are designed to die.
12 And to our neighbors sevenfold.
into their (...) pay:
Their vile reproach wherewith O LORD
reproached thee have they.
13 So we thy folk and pasture sheep,
will give thee thanks always:
And unto generations all,
we will show forth thy praise.
PSALM: LXXX. To the chief musician upon (...) Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.
THou that leadst Joseph as a flock.
O Isreal's shepherd hear;
Who dwel^^ between the Cherubi^^.
O shine thou forth most clear.
2 Ephraim before, and Benjamin,
Man^^sehs tribe also:
O stir thou up thy strength, (...),
(...) salvation show.
3 O God (...) thou us again.
and cause thy (...)
To shine forth upon us, that we
may have deliverance.
4 LORD God of (...), how long will thou
s^oak against thy peoples prayers.
5 Thou make them to feed upon
the bread of mournful tears.
And giv'st them many tears to drink.
6 Our neighbour^ strife likewise
Thou make us, and amongst themselves,
do laugh our enemies*
7 O God of hoasts turn us again,
and cause thy countenance
To shine forth upon us, so we
shall have deliverance.
(2)
8 From Egypt thou have brought a Vine,
forth also thou did cast
The heathen people, in their room,
the same thou planted have.
9 Yea thou before it did prepare
a room, where it might st^nd:
Thou did it cause deep root to take,
and it did (...) the (...),
10 Her shade hid hills, her bough^ also.
like goodly Cedars stood.
11 She sent her bough^ unto the (...)*
her branches to the (...)*
12 O why then have thou broken (...)
her hedges utterly,
So that all those do pluck at her
that in the way pass by?
13 The Boar out of the wilderness,
does wasting it annoy:
And wild beasts of the field, the same
devouringly destroy.
14 We do beseech thee to return,
O God of hoasts, incline
To look from heaven, and behold,
and visit thou this Vine*
15 The Vineyard which thou have also
with thy right hand set fast:
That branch lik^wise which for thy self
confirmed thou strongly have.
16 It is consumed with the fire,
and utterly cut down:
They perish do, and that because
thy countenance does frown.
17 Upon the man of thy right hand,
thine hand let present be:
Upon the son of man whom thou
have made so strong for thee.
18 So from henceforth we never will
from th^e go back ^t all:
O do thou quicken us, and we
upon thy Name will call.
19 LORD (...) of (...),

To (...)

PSALM: LXXXI. To the (...) A Psalm of (...).
UNto the might (...) our strength*

2 Take up a psalm of melody*
the (...).
Together with the Psal^ery*
and (...) string.
3 As in the (...) of the (...)
with Trumpet (...)
As in appointed time and day
of our solemnity.
4 Because that unto Israel,
this thing a statute was;
And by the God of Jacob this
did for a judgment pass.
5 This witness he in Joseph set*
when he through Egypt went;
Whereas a language I did he^r,
but knew not what it meant
6 I from the burden which he bare
his shoulder did set free:
His hands also were from the pots
delivered by (...)*
7 Thou calld'st in ^^eats, and I (...) ^^eed
in thunders s^cracie*
I answered thee: at Merib^h
its waters proved thee. Selah.
(2)
8 Hear O my people, and I will
unto thee testify:
If that thou will O Israel,
hear me attentively.
9 There shall not any strange God be:
in midst of thee at all;
Nor unto any foreign God.
thou bowing down shall fall.
10 I am the LORD thy God, who thee
from land of Egypt led:
Thy mouth open wide, and thou by me
with plenty shall be fed.
11 My people yet would not give ear,
unto the voice I spoke:
And Israel would not in me,
their full contentment take.
12 So their perverse intents of heart
I left them up to have:
And let them walk on in their way
which their own counsels gave.
13 O that my people unto me
obedient had bin!
And O that Israel he had
walked my ways within.
14 I should within a little time
have pulled down their foes:
I should have turned my hand upon
such as did them oppose.
15 The (...) of the LORD to him
obedience should have f^ynd:
But unto (...)
their time should have remaynd.
16 And with the finest of the wheat
have nourisht them should he:
With h^ny of the rock, I should
have satisfied thee.
PSALM: LXXXII. A Psalm of Asaph.
THe mighty God does stand within
the assembly of the strong:
And he it is that righteously,
does judge the gods among.
2 Give judgment of unrighteousness
how long a time will ye?
Will ye accept the countenance
of those that wicked be?
3 See that the needy ye defend*
also the fatherless:
Unto the afflicted justice do*
and to them in distress.
4 The wasted poo^, and those (...)
in need, deliver ye:
And them redeem out of the han^,
of such is wicked (...).
5 They know not, (...)
in darkness they walk (...)
The earths foundations all of (...)*
quite out of course are (...).
6 I said* th^^ ye are gods, likewise
son of the high^^^ all.
7 But ye shall die like (...), and like
one of the princ^s fall.
8 That thou may (...) the earth, O God
do thou thy self advance:
For thou shall have the nations all
for thine inheritance.
PSALM: LXXXIII. A Psalm or Song of Asaph.
O God do not thou silence keep*
no longer speech refrayn,
O mighty God, do thou likewise
no longer still remayn
2 For lo they that thine enemies be
do rage tumultuously:
And they that haters be of thee,
have lift the head on high.
3 Against those that thy people are,
they crafty counsel take:
Also against thy hidden ones
they consult (...) m^ke.
4 They said, lest they a ^ation be
let us cut them down therefore,
That in remembrance Isr^els name
may not be any more.
5 Because they couns^l taken h^^e
together with consent:
And in confederacy close
they are against thee (...).
6 The tabernacle of Edo^,
and of the Ish^^^elites,
The people of the Hagarens,
and of the Moabites.
7 Gebal, and Ammon, Amaleck,
together do conspire:
The Philistims, with them that be
inhabit^nts of Tire.
8 Assure morover is combined
with them in amity:
And they have been an arm of strength
to Lots posterity.
(2)
9 As thou did to the Midianites,
so do to them also:
As Jabin to, and Sisera
at Kishons brook, so do.
10 Who near to End or suddenly
were quite discomfited:
Who also did become as dung
that on the earth is spread.
11 Like unto Oreb, and like Zeeb,
make thou their Nobles fall;
As Zebah, and Zalmu^na too,
make thou their Princes all.
12 Who said, for our possession,
Gods houses let us take.
13 My God them like a wheel, like straw
before the wind them make.
14 As fire does burn a wood, and is
the flame sets hills on fire:
15 So with thy temp^st them pursue,
and fright them in thine ire.
16 Do thou their faces all f^^l full
of ignominious ^h^^e:
That so they may O LORD* be made
to seek unto thy name.
17 Put to confusion let them be,
and vexed sore for ay:
Yea let them unto shame be put.
and utterly decay.
18 That men may know that thou whose name
JEHOVAH is alone:
Art over all the earth throughout
advanced the highest one.
PSALM: LXXXIIII. To the chief musician upon G^ttith A Psalm for the (...) of
Kor^h.
HOw amiable LORD of hoasts

Wherein she may her young ones lay,

O thou that art of Armies LORD,
my King my God also.
4 O blessed ^re they within thy house
who dwell* still they will thee praise*
5 Blessed is ye man whose strength's in thee
In whose heart are their ways.
5 Who as they pass through Baca's Vale
a ^o^ta^n do it make:
Also the pools that are therein,
their fill of rain ^o take.
7 From strength to strength they go: to God
in Sion all appear.
8 LORD God of hoasts, O hear my prayr
O Jacobs God, give ear.
(2)
9 Behold O God, our s^ield: the face
of thine anointed see.
10 For better's in thy Courts a day
then elsewhere thousands be:
I rather had a doorkeeper
be in the house of my God,
Then in the tents of wickedness
to settle mine abode.
11 Because the LORD God is a Sun,
he is a shield also:
Jehovah on his people grace
and glory will bestow:
No good thing will be hold from them
that do walk uprightlie.
12 O LORD of Hoasts, the man is blessed
that puts his trust in thee.
PSALM: LXXXV. To the chief musician, A Psalm for the sonns of Korah.
O LORD thou favored have thy land:
Of Jacob the captivity,
Thou have returned with thine hand.
2 Thou also the iniquity
H^st of thy people pardoned:
Thou all their sin have covered. Selah.
3 Thou all thine anger did withdraw:
From thy fierce indignation
Thou turned have thy self away.
4 O God of our salvation,
Convert thou us, and do thou make
Thine anger toward us to flake.
5 Ay shall thy wrath be us upon?
Will thou thine indignation
Draw out to generation?
And unto generation?
6 Will thou not turn and quicken us?
That joy in thee thy folk may thus!
(2)
7 LORD on us show thy mercy: eke
Thy saving health on us bestow.
8 I Will hea^ what God ye LORD will speak
For hee'^ speak peace his folk unto,
And to his saints: but let not them
To foolishness return again.
9 His saving health is nigh at hand,
Surely to all that do him fear;
That glory man dwell in our land.
10 Mercy and truth are me^ full near,
Prosperit^, and righteousness.
Embracing did each other kiss.
11 Truth springs out of the earth: also
From heaven looks righteousness.
12 Yea, GOD shall yt that is good bestow:
Our land eke shall yield her increase.
13 Justice shall go before his face*
And in the way her steps shall place.
An other M^^^er.
O LORD thou favored have thy land:
Jacobs captivity
2 Thou have brought back. Thou pard'ned have
thy folks captivity,
Thou have close covered all their sin.
3 Thou have thy wrath off cast,
Thou from the fierceness of thine ire,
thy self returned have.
4 Turn us again, O thou the God
of our salvation:
And toward us cause thou to cease
thine indignation.
5 Will thou be angry still with us
for evermore? wh^^ shall
Thine anger be by thee drawn out
to generations all.
6 Will thou not us revive? in thee
thy folk rejoice shall (...)*
7 Show us thy mercy, LORD on us

8 (...) what God the LORD will say
because he will spe^k peace,
Unto his folk, and saints: lest they
return to foolishness.
9 Sure nigh to them that do him fear*
is his salvation:
That glory may within our land
have habitation.
10 Mercy and truth do jointly meet,
justice and peace do kiss.
11 Truth springs from (...) righteousness
from heaven looking is.
12 Yea what is good ye LORD shall give:
yield shall her fruit our land.
13 Justice shall before him go, and make
her steps in the way to stand.
PSALM: LXXXVI. A Prayer of David.
BOw down O LORD thine ear,
hear me attentively:
For I am poor, afflicted sore,
and needy too am I.
2 In safety keep my soul,
for gracious am I?
My God save thou thy servant now,
that does on thee rely.
3 Jehovah gracious
O be thou unto me*
Because that I aloud do cry
through all the day to thee,
4 O make thy servants soul
that it may joyful be:
Because that I O LORD, on high
do lift my soul to thee.
5 For thou O LORD art good,
to pardon proan also;
And to them all on thee that call
in mercy rich art thou.
6 Jehovah to thine ear
O let my prayer have place*
Attend unto the voice also
of my requests for grace.
7 In The day of my distress
to thee I will complain:
Because that thou will me unto
an answer give again.
8 Amongst the gods O LORD
like thee not any be:
And no works are that may compare
with those are wrought by thee*
(2)
9. The Nations all O LORD,
whom thou have made, the same
Shall come adore, even thee before
and gloryfie thy Name.
10 Because thou Mighty art,
the things that thou have done,
They wondrous are, and do declare
that thou art God alone.
11 Teach me thy way, O LORD;
walk in thy Truth will I:
Thine holy Name to fear the same
mine heart in unionly.
12 With all mine heart I will,
O LORD my God thee praise:
And also I will gloryfie
thy holy Name always.
13 Because that unto me
thy mercy does excel
My soul set free has been by thee
en'n from the lowest hell.
14 O God the proud arise
and violent troops against me:
My soul seek they to take away,
and before them set not thee.
15 But LORD a tender God*
thou art, and gracious,
Long suffering too, in mercy thou,
and truth art plenteous.
16 O turn to me thy face,
and on me mercy have:
Thy strength give thou thy servant now,
thine handmaids son O save.
17 Show me a sign for good;
and let my haters see;
Be shamed also: because LORD thou
do help and comfort me.
Another Meter.
LORD bow thine ear, hear me because
I needy am, and poor.
2 Because a gracious saint I am,
preserve my soul therefore:
O thou my God thy servant save
that does on thee rely*
3 To me be gracious LORD, because
to thee I daily cry.
4 Rejoice thy servants soul, for LORD
to thee mine lift I do
5 Because Jehovah thou art good,

And to them all in mercy rich,

6 LORD hear my prayer, attend the voice
of my requests withal.
7 I Will in my troubles on thee call,
for thou will answer me.
8 LORD none's like thee amongst ye gods
and like thy works none be.
9 The Nations all whom thou have made
shall come, and ( LORD) the same
Before thee shall bow down themselves,
and gloryfie thy Name.
10 Because thou Mighty art also,
the things that thou have done:
They wondrous are and do declare,
that thou art God alone.
11 Me O Jehovah teach thy way,
walk in thy tru^th will I*
With reverence to fear thy Name
my heart in union ty.
(2)
12 Thee LORD my God with all my heart
I will confess with praise:
And likewise I will gloryfie
thy holy Name always.
13 Because thy kindness merciful,
is very great to me:
And thou have from the lowest hell
my soul delivered free.
14 O God the proud against me rise,
and troops of violent men
Have sought my soul: and they have not
thee placed before them.
15 But LORD thou art a tender God,
and very gracious*
Long suffering too: in mercy thou
and truth art plenteous.
16 O turn thou unto me the face,
and on me mercy have:
Unto thy servant give thy strength,
thine handmaids son O save.
17 Show me a sign for good, that they
which hate me, may it see.
And be ashamed, because LORD thou
do help and comfort me.
A Psalm or song for the sonns of Korah.
HIs groundwork's in the holy hills.
2 Jehovahs love excells
To Sion's gates, more then to all
the tents where Jacob dwells.
3 Gods City things of glorious f^me,
are uttered of thee. Selah.
4 I Rahab will, and Babel name,
to them that knowledge me;
Behold Philistia, and Tire,
with Ethiopia there:
5 This man was born. This and that man
was also born in h^r^*
Of Sion thus it shall be said,
And he that is most high
Even he himself shall her prepare
a place of constancy.
6 The LORD when he the people tells,
shall count there born was he.

my springs are all in thee.

LORD God of my salvation,
Before thee day and night (...) I.
2 O let my p^^y^r (...)
Incline rhine ear unto my cry.
3 Because my soul is troubled so,
And to the grave my life draw's nigh.
4 Counted with them to the pit that go:
As on that has no strength am I.
5 As free among those that be dead,
Like to the slain in grave up shut:
By thee no more remembered;
And by thy hand that off are cut.
6 Thou have me laid in the pit most low*
In darknesses within deep caves.
7 Hard on me lies thy wrath, also
Thou me afflictst with all thy waves. Selah
8 Men that of mine acquaintance be,
Away from me thou far have put:
To them thou loathsome make me,
From coming forth I am up shut.
9 Because of mine affliction
Mine eye with mourning pines amay:
Jehovah, I thee call upon;
And to thee stretch my hands all day.
(2)
10 Show wonders to the dead will thou?
Shall dead men rise and thee confess? Selah
11 In The grave will thou thy kindness show
In lost estate thy faithfullness?
12 Thy works that wonderful have been,
What shall in darkness they be known*
And shall thy righteousness be seen,
In that land of oblivion?
13 But unto thee LORD have I cried:
At morn my prayer preventeth thee.
14 Why casts thou LORD my soul aside,
Why do thou hide thy (...) from me*

Removed off away from me:
To those that mine acquaintance are*
I am in dark obscurity.
PSALM: LXXXIX. Mase^il of Ethan the Ezrahito.
THe mercyes of Jehovah sing

2 For I have said, that mercy shall
for ever be up-built:
Establish in the very hea^^ns
thy faithfulness thou will.
^ With him that is my chosen one
a covenant made I have:
And to my servant David I
by oath this promise (...).
4 To perpetuity thy seed
establish sure I will:
Likewise to generations all,
thy throne I Will build up still. Selah.
5 Also the heavens thy wonders LORD,
they shall with praise confess:
Within the assembly of the saints,
likewise thy faithfulness.
6 For to the LORD the heavens within
who is it we can compare?
Who Is like the LORD among the sonns
of them that mighty are.
(2)
7 God greatly in the Church of saints
is to be had in fear:
And to be reverenc't of all those
that round about him are.
8 Jehovah O thou God of hoasts,
strong Jah who is like to thee?
Thy faithfulness on every side
does round encompass thee.
9 Over the raging of the sea
thou did dominion bear:
When as the waves thereof arise,
by thee they stilled are.
10 Like to one slain, thou broken have
in pieces Rahab quite:
Thou have dispersed thine enemies,
even by thine arm of might.
11 To thee the heavens do belong,
the earth likewise (...) thee:
The world with fullness of the same
by thee they sounded be.
12 The North together with the South
thou did create the same:
Tabor likewise* and ^^rmons hill,
rejoice shall in thy Name.
(3)
13 Thou have a very mighty arm,
thy hand in strength is great:
And also that right hand of thine
aloft on high is set.
14 The habitation of thy throne
justice and judgment are:
Their way before thy face to go
both grace and truth prepare.
15 O blessed are the people that
the joyful sound do know:
LORD in thy countenances light,
they up and down shall go.
16 They all the day shall in thy Name
rejoice exceedingly:
And in thy righteousness they shall
be lifted up on high.
17 Because that thou art of their strength
the glorious dignity:
Our horn eke shall exalted be
in thy benignity.
18 Because Jehovah is to us
a safe protection;
And he that is our Sovereign,
is Isr'els holy-one.
(4)
19 Then did thou speak in vision
unto thy saint* and said,
On such an one as mighty is
I have salvation laid.
20 One chosen from the folk^ I raised,
my servant David I
Have found, him I anointed with
my oil of sanctity.
21 With whom my hand shall stablish't be
mine arm him strengthen shall.
22 Also the enemy shall not
exact on him at all:
Nor shall the sonns of wickedness
afflict him any more.
23 Before him I Will beat down his foes,
and plague his haters sore.
24 My Mercy yet, and Verity,
with him shall be the same:
His horn likewise shall be on high
exalted in my name.
25 Morover I within the sea,
will cause his hand to stand;
Likewise within the rivers I
will se^^^e his right hand.
^6 To me, my Father thou* my God,
and health's Rock, he shall cry.
27 And I will (...) him my first born;
then (...) Kings more high.
28 My mercy I will keep for him,
to times which ever last:
With him also my covenant
shall be established fast.
(5)
29 Morover I his seed will make
for to endure always:
And I his throne establish will
like as of heaven the days.
30 If that his sonns forsake my Law,
and from my judgments swerve:
31 If they my Statutes break, and do
my precepts not observe;
32 Their bold transgressions with the tod,
then visit sore will I:
Likewise with stripes I visit will,
their cross iniquity.
33 My loving kindness yet from him
away take will not I:
Nor suffer will in any wise,
my Faithfullness to ly.
34 The Covenant I have made with him,
shall not by me be broke:
That which is gone out of my lips
I never will revoake.
35 On e^^ware I by my Holiness
if I to David ly.
36 (...) assuredly shall last
to perpetuity.
And (...) the Sun (...) his throne*
37 It like the moon shall stay:
And as in heaven a witness true,
shall stablisht be for ay.
(6)
38 But thou have cast off, and abhorred;
wroth with thine oynted one,
^9 Thou art. Thy servants covenant
thou have made it as none:
By casting it unto the ground,
thou have profaned his crown.
40 His forts to ruin thou have brought,
his hedges all broke down.
41 All spoil him by the way that pass,
his neighbor's scorn he is made.
42 His foes right hand thou have extolled,
thou make all is enemies glad.
43 And of his sword the edge thou turn'st
nor mak^st him stand in ^ight.
44 Thou do his crown cast down to ground
and cease his glory bright.
45 And of his youthful years the days,
thou have diminished:
All over with confusion
thou have him co^^^^d.
(7)
46 How long Jehovah, will thou hide
thy self, for eve^ ^ore?
Like as a burning fire ^^ide
shall thy displeasure (...)?
48 To thy remembrance do thou call,
how short a time have I:
Wherefore have thou created all
men's sonns to vanity?
48 What man alive in strength so great,
that death he shall not see?
That from the hand of grave shall set
his soul at liberty? Selah.
49 Thy former loving kindnesses
O LORD, where are they (...)?
Which in thy truth, and faithfullness*
to David thou did vow?
50 O LORD do thou thy servants scorn
unto remembrance call:
How in my breast I have it born,
from mighty people all.
51 Wherewith O LORD thine enemies,
do cast reproach upon:
Wherewith they do reproach the steps
of thine anointed one.
52 O let Jehovah blessed be
to generations all*
Amen so let it be also
Amen, be so it shall.
THE FOURTH BOOK.
PSALM: XC. A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
THou Lord our stay, have been an house
of habitation
From generation unto us
to generation.
2 Before the mountains were begot,
the earth and world before
Thou formed had; thou art a God
from ay for evermore.
3 Thou do by bruising to decay
turn miserable men*
Ye sonns of men, then thou do say,
return ye back again.
4 For while a thousand years do last,
it is but in thy sight
As yesterday when it is past,
and as a watch by night.
5 Thou do them bear away like as
a flood that overflowes:
Like sheep they are, and as the grass
which in the morning grows.
6 Which in the morn is flourishing,
and springing up does rise;
Which is cut down at evening,
it withers up likewise.
7 Because by reason of thine ire,
we wasted are away:
And by thine angers burning fire
we speedily decay.
8 Thou have set our iniquities
before thee in thy sight:
Our secret evils are likewise,
before thy faces light,
9 Because that in thy fury all
our days away are rol'd:
We spend away our years withal*
like as a tale that is told.
10 The time is threescore years and (...),
which our years days contain:
And if through strength they fourscore been
their strength is grief and pain.
For soon its gone, and hence we pass.
11 O who is he does know
Thine angers strength? according as
thy fear thy wrath is so.
12 O give thou us instruction
to number so our days,
That we our hearts may thereupon*
turn into wisdoms ways.
13 Jehovah turn thy self again*
how long yet shall it be?
14 O let it thee repent for them
that servants are to thee.
15 According to the days wherein
affliction we have had:
And years wherein ill we have seen*
now also make us glad.
16 Unto thy servants O do thou
thy handy work declare:
And show thy comely glory to
those that their children are*
17 The beawtie of Jehovah thus
our God let on us be:
Confirm our handy work on us*
confirmed be it by thee.
PSALM: XCI.
HE that within the secrecy
of the highest does reside*
In shadow of The Almighty he
shall lodging safe abide.
2 He is my hope and fortress high,
I of the LORD will say
He is my God, and in him I
my confidence will stay.
3 The fowlers snare surely from thence
he shall deliver thee:
And from the infectious pestilence,
he also shall thee free.
4 He with his feathers shall thee hide*
thy trust in's wings shall be:
His strength shall as a shield abide,
and buckler unto thee.
5 With fear thou shall not be dismayed
for terror by the night;
Nor of the arrow be afraid,
that has by day his ^^^ght.
6 Nor for the plagues infection,
that walks in darkness fast;
Nor for the sore destruction,
that does at noon day wast.
7 A thousand at thy side shall fall,
yea and ten thousand here
At thy right hand, but yet it shall
not unto thee come near*
8 This thing thou only with thine eyes
shall heedfully regard;
Thou shall behold how that likewise
the wicked have reward.
9 For (thou have said) Jehovah thou
art my protection;
The highest one thou make also
thine habitation.
10 Not any evil casually
shall unto thee befall:
Not yet shall any plague come nigh
thy dwelling place at all.
11 Because that he his Angels will
command concerning thee:
That they may thee preserve from ill,
whereas thy w^yes shall be.
12 The hollow of their hands upon
thee save they shall up bear:
Lest thou thy foot against a stone
should dash at unaware*
13 Thou shall upon the Lion strong,
and on the ^dde^go,
The Dragon and the Lion young*
thou trample shall also.
14 For he has set his love on me.
him therefore free will I*
Because (...) thrown my n^me has he.
I will him set on high.
15 He shall in prayer call on me*
and I will answer him.
I will with him in trouble be,
I Will freely him redeem.
And I will honor him also.
16 Him I will satisfy
With length of days* and to him show
my saving health will I.
PSALM XCII. A Psalm or (...) for the Sabbath day.
Unto Jehovah thanks to give
it is a comely thing:
And praises forth, O thou most high
unto thy name to sing.
2 Thy loving kindness forth to show
within the morning light:
Thy truth and faithfulness also,
to show forth every night.
3 Upon a ten string'd instrument.
the ^saltery upon.
Upon the solemn ^ounding harp:
with meditation.

h^st made me to rejoice:
And also in thy handy work
I will triumph with voice.

But thou Jehovah do abide
Forevermore most high.
9 For lo O LORD thine enemies
for lo thy foes shall fill,
The workers of iniquities,
they shall be sc^ttred all.

10 By thee mine horn shall be (...) old
as Unicorns on high,

PSALM. CI. A Ps^lm of David.
I Mercy will and judgment sing,
LORD I will sing to thee.
2 I Will wisely do in perfect way.
who^ thou shall come to me*
I will (...) midst of my house walk
in mine hearts uprightness.
3 I will not set before mine eyes
the work of wickedness:
I hate their work that turn aside*
it shall not cleave me to.
The froward heart from me shall part*
none evil will I know.
I Will cut him off that slandereth
his neighbor privily:
can not bear the proud in heart*
nor him that looks high.
6 Upon the faithful in the land
mine eyes shall be, that they
May dwell with me, he shall me serv^*
that walks in perfect way.
7 He that a worker is of guile
in my house shall not dwell:
Before me settled shall not be
the man that lies does tell.
8 Yea all the wicked of the land*
I early will destroy:
To cut off from Gods City all
that work iniquity.
PSALM: CII. A Prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and powers ^ut
his complaint before the LORD.
JEHOVAH hear when I do pray,
And let my cry come unto thee.
2 From me hide not thy face away,
(...) day when trouble is on me:
Thine ^ar to me O do thou bend,
(...) day I cry have, answer me.
^ For as the smoke my days do spend,
And like an hearth my bores burnt be.
4 My heart is finite, and (...) dry*
That I to eat my bread forget.
5 My groanings voice, the cause is why
My bones unto my skin are set.
6 In desert like a Pe^ican,
Like Owl in wilderness am I.
7 I watch, and like a Sparrow a^
On house top solitarily.
8 My ^oes reproach me daily yet,
Against me they rage, against me they swear.
9 That I for bread do ashes eat;
And mix my drink with weeping tear,
to Thine anger is the cause hereof*
Also thy vehement disdain:
For thou have set me up aloft,
And thou have cast me down again.
(2)
11 Shade-like my days decline away;
And like the witherd grass I fall.
12 But LORD thou do abide for ay;
Thy memory eke to ages all.
13 Thou will arise and forth wilt show,
Thy mercy Sion her upon:
Because her time of favor now,
Yea time appointed is come on.
14 For in her stones thy servants ( dear)
Delight her dust they pity ^o.
15 So heathens shall ye LORDs name fear,
All Kings of the earth thy glory too.
16 When God shall Sion up erect,
He in his glory shall appear.
17 The poor's petition he will respect*
And he will not despise their prayer.
18 This shall in writ enrolled be,
For the succeding after race*
The folk which shall created be,
They herupon the LORD shall praise.
19 For from his Sanctuary high,
From heavens the LORD y^ earth does see.
20 To hear their groans who prisoners ly,
To loose them that death's children be.
21 The LORD praise in Jerusalem,
His Name in Sion to record,
22 When peoples jointly gather them,
And Kingdoms for to serve the LORD.
(3)
23 Weak in the way my strength he made*
And of my life ^ut short the d^y.
24 In midst of my days, I sai^,
My God O take me not away:
Thy years throughout all ^ges st^y.
25 Thou have the earth's foundations laid
For elder time, and heavens they,
Are works yt thine own hands have made.
26 They perish shall, but thou shall last:
Yea like a garment they (...) all
Wax old, and as a vesture wast
Thou shall them change, be changed they shall
27 But thou the same abidest still
And of thine years none end shall be.
28 Thy servants race continue will;
Their seed shall stablisht be with thee.
PSALM: CIII. A Psalm of David.
THe LORD bless, O my soul, and all
in me his holy Name.
2 The LORD bless O my soul, and all
his bounties mind the same:
For he it is, that does forgive
all thine iniquities.
3 And it is he that does relieve
all thine infirmities.
4 Who ransoms from destruction
thy life, and crowns thee
With his most dear compassion,
and kind benignity.
5 Who with good things abundantly
does satisfy thy mouth:
So that like as the Eagles be,
renewed is thy youth.
6 The LORD does judgment, justice too,
for all oppressed ones.
7 His ways to Moses he did show,
his acts to Isr'els sonns.
(2)
8 The LORD is merciful, also
he is very gracious:
And unto anger he is slow,
in mercy plenteous.
6 Contention he will not mainteyn
to perpetuity:
And he his wrath will not reteyn
unto eternity.
10 According to our sins likewise,
to us he has not done;
Nor has he our iniquities
rewarded us upon.
11 Because even as the heavens are
in height the earth above:
So toward them that do him fear,
confirmed is his love.
12 Like as the East and west they are
far in their distances;
He has removed away so far
from us our trespasses.
13 A Fathers pity like unto;
which he his sonns does bear:
Like pity does Jehovah show,
to them that do him fear.
14 For he does know this f^^me of ours,
he minds that dust we be.
15 M^ns d^yes are lik^ ye gr^ss like flowr,
in field, so flowe^^^eth h^e.
16 For over it the wind does pass,
and it away does go:
Also the place whereas it was
no longer shall it know.
(3)
17 Who fear the LORD, his mercy is
on them from ay to ay:
So likewise does his righteousness
on children's children stay.
18 To such as keep his covenant
that do in mind up lay:
The charge of his commandment,
that it obey they may.
19 The LORD has in the heavens high,
established his throne:
And over all his Royalty
does bear dominion.
20 O ye his Angels that excel
in strength, bless ye the LORD*
That do his word, that harken well
unto the voice of's word.
21 All ye the Armies of the LORD,
O bless Jehovah still:
His ministers that do accord,
his pleasure to fulfill.
22 Yea all his works in places all

Bless ye Jehovah: O my soul
Jehovah bless alone.
PSALM: CIIII.
O 'Thou my soul Jehovah bless,
thou LORD my God, in might
Excel'st, thou art with comeliness
and Majesty bedight.
2 Who do thy self with light array,
as if a robe it were:
Who like a curtain do display,
the heavens every where.
3 Who does the beams of's chamber lay
in the waters, and he makes
The clouds his charriots, and his way
on wings of wind he takes.
4 His ministers a fiery ^^ame,
his Ang^^s spirits makes
5 The earth he founded on her frame,
so that it never shakes.
6 As with a robe thou with the deep,
did overspread the land:
Aloft above the mountains steep,
the waters they did stand.
7 When thou did them rebuke, they fled*
even then away full fast:
And at thy thunders voice they sped
their course away in have.
8 They up aloft by mountains past,
down by the vales did go:
The place for them which fixed thou have
until they come unto.
9 Thou have appointed them a bound
which they may not pass over:
That they to cover the dry ground,
may turn again no more.
(2)
10 Into the vales he sends springs,
which run among the hills:
Thence drink to all field-beasts he brings;
wild Asses drink their fil^s.
12 The fowls of heaven dwell there, which ^ing
among the sprigs with mirth.
13 (...) lo^^s to hills he ra^n does bring
(...) works fruit ^^lls the earth.
14 For (...) grass, and for man's good
he makes the herb to spring:
That what may serve them for their food;
he from the earth may bring.
15 And wine man's heart that makes glad.
and oil to make's face bright:
And for the heart of man gives bread.
it to support with might.
16 Jehovah's trees that are most strong,
no fill of sap do want:
The Cedar trees of Lebanon,
the which himself does plant.
17 That so the little birds may there
upon them build their nest:
As for the Stork the fir-trees are
the places of her rest.
18 The hills for wild goats refuge be,
the conies rocks enclose.
19 The Moon for seasons set has he:
the Sun his setting knows.
20 Thou darkness make and night comes on
when wood-beasts creep out all.
21 Roar for their prey ^o Lions young,
from God for food they call.
22 The Sun does rise, they in their denns
then couch, they go aside.
23 Man to (...) work and labor tends
until the evening ti^e.
(3)
24 Thy works (LORD) are how manifold*
them all thou made with skill:
The earth does of thy riches hold
abundantly her fill.
25 So does this Sea so great and wide,
wherein things creeping be,
Beyond all count* sm^ll beasts, beside
those of great quantity.
26 There go the ships, there thou did make
Leviathan to play.
27 Their food in season to partake,
all on thee waiting stay.
28 They gather that thou do bestow,
thine h^nd thou openest wide*
With such things as are good they so
are fully satisfied.
29 Thou hid'st thy face, they troubled are
their breath thou take away,
Then do they (...) wise repair
un^o their d^st do they.
30 Thou m^k'st thy spirit forth to go,
they ^re creat^d then;
And of the earth the face also
thou do renew again.

31 The glory of Jehovah shall

The LORD shall in his doings all,
(...) pleasure joyfully.
32 The earth does fall a trembling when
he th^rupon does look:
The mountains he does touch, and then
they thereupon do smo^k.
33 I Will to the LORD sing cheerfully,
throughout my life always:
While I ^ being have, will I
unto my God sing praise.
24 Full sweet the meditation
of him shall be to me:
I in the EVEN-BE^ING one,
exceeding glad will be.
35 From off the earth let sinners cease,
and wicked be no more:
O thou my soul Jehovah bless,
praise ye the LORD therefore.
PSALM: CV.
O Praise the LORD, call on his name:
'^ong people show his facts.

(...) of all ^s wond^^^us acts.
3 Let their he^rts joy that seek ye LORD

4 The LORD seek, and his strength his face

5 Remember ye what he has done,
^
^
^
6 O ye his servant Abraham's seed,
ye Jacob sonn^ elect.
7 He is the LORD our God, through the earth
his judgments take effect.
8 His Covenant for evermore,
and his commanded word*
A thousand generations to,
he does in mind record.
9 The covenant which he heretofore
did unto Abraham make:
And unto Isaac afterward,
likewise an oath did take.
10 And unto Jacob for a Law,
he did confirm it fast:
To Israel for a covenant,
that evermore should last.
(2)
11 He said I Will give thee Canaans land:
by lot heirs to be there.
12 When few, yea very few in count,
and strangers in it they were:
13 When they did from one nation,
another pass unto:
When as they from one kingdom did
to other people go.
14 He suffered none to do them wrong,
yea Kings for them che^kt he.
15 Touch ye not mine ^noynted ones;
my prophets (...) not ye.
16 He called for ^^mine on the land;
all (...) of bread he brake.
17 Before th^^ sent a man: they sold
Joseph a slave to make.
18 Whose feet they did with fetters hurt:
he did in yron^ ly.
19 Until the time his word did come,
the LORDs words did him try*
20 The King, the peoples ruler sent,
loosed him, and let him go*
21 He made him lord of all his house,
of all is wealth ruler too.
22 That he his noble Peers might bind
according to his heart;
And that unto his Senators
he wisdom might impart.
23 Then also into Egypt land,
his father Israel came:
And Jacob was a sojourner
within the land of Him.
24 He much increast his folk, and made
them then their foes more strong.
25 Their heart he turned his folk to hate,
to do his servants wrong.
(3)
26 His servant Moses he did send,
and Aaron whom he chose.
27 His signs and wonders them amongst,
they in H^ms land disclose.
28 He darkness sent and made it dark,
nor did they 's word gainsay.
29 He turned their waters into blood*
and he their fish did slay.
30 Great store of Frogs their land brought forth
in chambers of their Kings.
31 He spoke, there came mixed swarms, and lice
in all their coasts he brings.
32 He gave them hall for rain, and in
their land, fyres flame did make.
33 Their vines and figtrees both he smote
their coast trees eke he brake.
34 He spoke, and then the Locusts came*
and Catterpillers such,
The number of them was so great
that none could count how much.
35 All their lands herbs they ate and did
fruit of their ground devour:
36 All first born in their land he smote,
the chief of all their power.
(4)
37 He also thence did bring them forth
with silvar, and with gold;
And there was not among their tribes,
a feeble person told.
38 At their outgoing Egypt joy'd,
for on them fell their dread.
39 A cloud for covering, and a fire
to light the night he spread.
40 They asked* and he brought qualls, with bread
he filled them from the sky
41 He clave the rock, and waters flowed,
floods ran in places dry.
42 For on his holy promise he:
and servant Abraham thought.
43 With joy his people, and with songs,
forth he his chosen brought.
44 He of the heathen people did
the land on them bestow:
The labor of the people they
inherited also.
45 To this intent that so they might
his Statutes keep always:
And that they might his Laws observe:
therefore Jehovah praise:
PSALM: CVI.
THe LORD pr^ise* to the LORD give thanks
because that good is he:
Because his mercy does endure,
to perpetuity.
2 Who can the LORDs strong acts forth tell
or all his praise display.
3 Blessed they that judgment keep, and who
does righteousness always.
4 With favor of thy people, LORD,
do thou remember me.
Me v^sit with the say^ng health,
that comes alone from thee.
5 To see thy chosens go^d, and in
thy n^tions joy r^joyce:
That I with thine inheritance,
may lift a glorious voice.
6 As our forefathers did so we
have finned swervingly:
We pr^ctis'd have iniquity,
we have done wickedly.
(2)
7 Our fathers learned not wonders thine
in Egypt did not mind
Thy many mere yes* but at Sea*
red Sea r^bel'd unkind.
8 Nev^rtheless he saved them,
evin for his own Names sake:
That by the same his mighty power*
he manifest might make.
9 The red Sea he rebuk't also,
and up the same was dried:
So them as through the wilderness*
he through the Sea did guide.
10 And from his hand that hated them,
he freely did them save:
He from the enemies hand likewise,
to them redemption gave.
11 The waters overwhelmed their foes:
of them was left not one.
12 They did believe his word, they sang
his praises thereupon.
(3)
13 They soon forgot his works, nor would
they for his counsel stay.
14 But much in wilderness did lust,
in the desert God tried they.
15 And he their suit them gave; but sent
leanness their soul into.
16 They env'd Moses in the camp,
Aaron Gods faint also.
17 The opned earth D^than devoured,
and hid (...) troop.
18 And fire was kindled in their rout,
flame burnt the wicked up.
19 In Horeb made a ^^lf ^^so.
molt Image worshipped they*
20 They changed their glory to be lik^
an ox that rareth hay.
21 They God forgot their Savior which
in Egypt did great acts.
22 Works wondrous in the land of Ham*
by th'red sea dreadful facts.
23 And said, he would the^^ ^^roy, but that
his chosen Moses then.
Stood in the breach before him, to turn
his wrath from wasting th^^.
(4)
24 Yet they despised the pleasant land,
nor did believe his word.
2^ But murmured in their rents, the voice
they heard not of the LORD.
26 To make them fall l'th desert, then
against them he lift his hand.

28 And to (...) or they joynd themselves

29 Their works his wrath did thus pro^^^*
^
30 Then (...) rose, and judgment did:
and so the plague did stay.
31 Which justice in him counted was,
to age and age for ay.
(5)
32 At th'waters of contention,

So that with Moses for their sake*

33 Because his spirit they (...)*

34 The nations, as ^ LORD them charged

35 But were amongst the heathen mixed:

36 And did their Idols serve, which them
became a share unto.
37 Yea unto Devils they their sonn^
and daughters offered.
38 And guiltless blood, blood of their sonns
and of their daughters shed.
Whom unto Canaans ^dols they
gave up in sacrifice:
The land with blood abundantly
polluted was likewise.
39 Thus with the works were they defiled
which they themselves had done
And they did go a whoring with
inventions of their own.

40 (...) against his folk*

So that he the inheritance

44 Yet he regarded their distress,

45 And he did so remembrance call
for then ^is covenant.
And in his many mercyes did
46 repent. And made them be
Pitty'd of all that led them forth
into captivity.

4 In The desert strayed ^n desert way,

5 They hungry were and thirsty they,
their souls within them pined.
6 Then did they to Jehovah cry*
when they were in distress.
Who did them set at liberty,
out of their anguishes.
7 In such a way as was most right,
he led them forth also:
That to a City which they might

8 O that men praise Jehovah would*

(2) to Prisoners.
10 Such as in darkness, and within
the shade of death abide:
The^ who are sore afflictions in,
and fast in irons ayed.
11 Because they in rebellion
against Gods word did rise:
They also of the highest one
the counsel did despise.
12 Therefore with sore affliction
he did bring down their heart:
Down did they fall, and there was none
could help to them in part.
13 Then did they to Jehovah cry,
when they were in distress:
Who did then set at liberty,
out of their anguishes.
14 He did them out of darkness bring,
also deaths shade from under.
As for the hands that they were in
he did them break asunder.
15 O that men praise Jehovah would,
for his great goodness then!
And for his wonders manifold
unto the sonns of men!
16 For he did into shivers shake

22 And of thanksgiving sacrifice
let them their offerings bring:
While they his works declare likewise
^et them for gladness sing.
(4) to the Seafaring
23 Who go to Sea in ships, theirs acts
in waters great who do.
24 Th^se do behold Jehovahs facts,
in the deep his wonders too.
25 For he commands, instantly,
the stormy wind does rise:
Which life's the waves thereof on high,
they mount up to the skies:
26 Down to the depths again they strike,
their soul with ill does quail.
27 They ^oel, and (...) drunkard like,
and all their (...) does sail.
28 Then do they to Jehovah cry.
when they are in distress:
And he them brings speedily
out of their anguishes.
29 He makes the storm a calm* that so

30 Their rest glads them, he brings them to

31 O that men praise Jehovah would*
for his great goodness then*
And for his wonders manifold,

32 Also the peoples church within,
him let them highly raise:
Assembled where the Elders bin;
him also let them praise.

33 He turns streams to a desert sand*
to drought, the springing well.
34 To barrenness a fruitful land;

And like a flock of sheep unto

PSALM: CIX. To the chief musi^ian A Psalm of David.
GOD of my praise, hold not thy peace
2 For they who wicked be
Their mouth, and mouth of guilfullness
are opned wide against me.
Against me they speak with lying tongue.
3 And compass me about
With words of hate: and me against*
with out a cause they fough^.
4 They for my love, mine enemies are,
but I my prayer make,
5 And ill for good rewarded me;
and hate for my loves sake.
6 Appoint a wicked person, that
over him may have command:
And likewise at his right hand let
the adversary stand.
7 When he is judged, let him then
condemned be therein:
And let the prayer that he does make,
be turned into sin.
8 Yea let his days be few, and let
his chardg another take.
9 His children let be fatherless,
his wife a widow make.
10 His children let be vagabonds,
let them a begging go:
And from their places desolate,
let them seek bread also.
(2)
11 Yea let th'extortioner catch all,
that does to him pertain:
And let the stranger spoil, what he
did by his labor gain.
12 Let there not any be to him,
that mercy may express:
Nor any one that savor may,
his children fatherless.
13 Let go into perdition,
the race that of him came:
In th'after generation*
ou^ razed be his name.
14 Remembered with the LORD, be his
fathers iniquitee:
And of his mother let the sin
out-blotted never be.
15 Before Jehovah let them be
continually put:
That from out of the earth he may
the memory of them cut.
16 Because that he remembered not,
compassion to impart:
But did pursue the needy poor,
to slay the broke in heart.
(3)
17 As he did cursing love, so let
the same unto him come:
As he did not in blessing joy,
so be it far him from.
18 With cursing like a robe, as he
him clothed; so let it go
In to his bowels water like,
like oil his bones into.
19 Like as a garment let it be
to him, him to array:
And for a girdle where with he
may gird himself always.
20 Thus let mine adversaries be,
rewarded from the LORD:
Thus them reward against my soul,
that speak an evil word.

And be they clothed as with a cloak.

PSALM: CXV.
NOt to us, not to us O LORD.

Both for thy truth and mercy's sake.
2 The heathen wherefore should they say,
Where is their God now gone away*
3 But heavens our God his seat does make
He has done whatsoever he would.
4 Their Idols silver are and gold;
The handy work of men they were.
5 They mouths have speechless yet they be
Eyes have they, but they do not see.
6 Ears have they, but they do not hear:
They roses have, which smell no ^ot.
7 Hands have they, but they handle not:
Feet have they but they do not go:
And through their throat they never spoke
8 Like them are they that do them makes
And all that trust in them are so.
9 Trust to the LORD O Israel:
He is their help, their shield as well.
10 Oh Aarons house ye LORD trust ye:
He is their help, their shield also.
11 Who fear ye LORD, him trust unto:
Their help, their shield also is he.

3 Our God is in the h^av'ns, he has
whatever pleas^d him done.
4 Their Idols silver are and gold,
m^ns handy work they be.
5 Mouths have they but they do not speak
and eyes, but do not see.
6 Ears have they, but they do not hear:
naught smell their noses ^oe.
7 Hands have they, but they handle not,
and feet, but do not go;
And nothing (...) they through their thr^^^*
8 Like unto them are they
That do them make, and all that do
their trust upon them stay.
9 O Israel trust thou in the LO^D,
he is their help and shield.
10 O Aarons house trust in the LORD*
he is their help and shield.
11 Who fear the LORD, trust in ye LORD

The house of Israel bless he will:

13 He will bless them that fear ye LORD:
the greater with the less.
14 Jehovah unto you, to you,
and to your son shall add.
15 You are the blessed of the LORD:
that heaven and earth has made.
16 The heavens unto Jehovah do
the heavens to him belong:
But he the earth distributed
the son of men among.
17 The dead praise not ye LORD, nor such

But ^s for us, we will bless the LORD,
from henceforth without end.

he bowed to none his (...),
3 The pangs of death on every side
about beset me round:
The pains of hell g^t hold on me,
distress and grief I found.
4 Upon Jehovahs Name therefore
I called, and did say:
Deliver thou my soul O LORD,
I do thee humbly pray.
5 Jehovah gracious is, and just;

Because the LORD has bounteously

Thou have mine eyes from tears likewise,
and feet from fall set free.

will walk the LORD before.
10 I did believe, th^rfore I spoke:
I was ^fflicted sore.
11 That every man a liar is;

Now in the presence of them all

In midst of thee Jerusalem,

5 I did lift up my voice to Jah,
from out of streightnes great:
The LORD an answer gave to me,

PSALM: CXX. A song of degrees.
I To the LORD cried in my streits,
and he did answer me.
2 From lying li^s, and guilfull tongue,
O LORD my soul set free.
3 What shall to thee a false tongue give,
or what on thee confer?
4 Sharp arrows of the mighty one,
with coals of Juniper.
5 O woe is me that sojourning
in Meshech I reside!
That I also within the tents
of Kedar do abide.
6 Long time my soul has dwelt with him
that peace does much abhor^*
7 I am for peace, but when I speak,
they ready are for war.
PSALM: CXXI. A song of degrees.
I To the hills lift up mine eyes.
from whence shall come mine aid.
1 Mine help does from Jehovah come,
which heaven and earth has made.
3 He will not let thy foot be moved*
nor slumber, that the^ keeps.
4 Lo he that keeps I^rael,
he slumbreth not, nor sleeps.
5 The LORD thy keeper is, the LORD
thy shade on thy ^ight hand.
6 Lest Sun by day* o^ Moon by night,
should thee by stro^k off^nd.
7 The LORD will keep thee from all ill:
thy soa^ he keeps (...).
8 thy goi^g out, and coming in*
the LORD keeps now and ay.
A song of degrees, of David.
I Joyd in them that said to me,
let us at the LORDs house meet,
2 O thou Jerusalem within
thy gates shall stand our feet.
3 Jerusalem is builded up
into a City frame:
In It self together uniform,
compacted is the same.
4 Whither the tribes, the tribes of Jah,
to Isreal's witness go:
That they unto Jehovahs Name,
their thankfullness may show.
5 Because the thrones of judgment there
established remain:
The thrones that do unto the house
of David appertain.
6 Pray for Jerusalem her peace,
they prosper that love thee.
7 Peace in thy walls, thy palaces
in them let safety be.
8 Both for my brethren and my friends
peace be, in thee say I.
9 I Will for our God Jehovahs house
seek thy prosperity.
PSALM: CXXIII. A song of ^^grees.
O Thou that in the heavens fitst,
I li^t mine eyes to thee.
2 Lo as unto their masters hand
the eyes of servants be:
As maids eyes to their mistress hand,
so are our eyes unto
The LORD our God, until that he
shall mercy on us show.
3 O LORD be gracious unto us,
to us O gracious be:
Because that filled with contempt
exceedingly are we.
4 Our soul is filled exceedingly
with scorns of men secure:
From them also that haughty be,
our souls contempt endure.
PSALM: CXXIIII. A song og degrees of David.
HAd not the LORD been on our side;
may Israel now proclaim.
1 Had not the LORD been on our side;
when men against us came.
3 They then had swallowed us alive*
when their wrath on us burned.
4 Then had the waters us o'rewhelmd*
the stream our soul o'return'd.
5 The waters proud then on our soul,
had passed on their way.
6 Blessed be the LORD that to their teeth
did not give us a prey.
7 Our soul is as a bird escaped,
out of the fowlers snare.
The (...) ^^nder broken is,
and we escaped are.
8 The succor which we do enjoy,
is in Jehovahs Name:
Who is the maker of the earth,
and of the heavens frame.
PSALM: CXXV. A song of degrees.
THey that do in Jehovah trust,
shall as mou^^ Sion be.
Which cannot be removed, but stands
(...) perpetuity.
^ Like as the mountains round about
Jerusalem do stay:
His people so the LORD surrounds,
from henceforth and ^or'^y.
3 The wicked^ (...) on just men's ^o^.
shall (...) abiding be:
Lest just men should put forth their hands
unto iniquity.
4 Unto all those men tha^ (...) good,
(...) goodness LORD ^^part:
And unto every on^ of them
that are of upright heart.
5 But who turn to their crooked ways,
the LORD shall make them go
With workers of iniquity:
but peace be Israel to.
A song of degrees.
WHen as Jehovah did return
Sions captivity:
At that time unto them that dream
compared might we be.
2 Then was our mouth with laughter (...)
with singing eke our tongue
The LORD has done great (...)
they said the heath'n among.
3 The LORD has done great things for us
whereof we joyful be:
O LORD like as the streams in the South,
turn our captivity.
5 Who sow in tears, shall reap in joy.
6 Who going, go, and mourn,
Bearing choice sand, shall sure with joy
bringing their ^^eaves return.
PSALM: CXXVII. A song of degrees for Solomon.
EXcept the LORD the house do build,
the builders work in vain:
Except the LORD the City keep,
the w^tchman wi^es in vain
2 It Is vain for you to rise betimes,
watch late, to feed upon
The bread of griefs: sure he gives sleep
to his beloved one.
3 Lo sonns are th'heritage of ye LORD:
the fruitful womb his wage.
4 As arrows in a strong man's hand,
are sonns of youthful age.
5 O blessed is the man which has
his quiver filled with those*
They shall not be ashamed in the (...)*
in speaking with their foes.
PSALM: CXXVIII. A song of degrees.
O blessed is every one,
That does Jehovah fear,
That walks his ways along.
2 For thou shall eat with cheer
Thy hands labor:
Blessed shall thou be, It well with thee
Shall be therefore.
3 Thy wife like fruitful Vine
Shall be by thine house side:
The children that be thine
Like Olive plants abide,
About thy board.
4 Behold thus blessed. That man does rest.
That fears the LORD.
5 Jehovah shall thee bless
From Sion, and thou shall see
Jerusalems goodness
All thy life's days that be.
6 And shall view well.
Thy children then. With their children,
Peace on Israel.
Another Meter.
THey blessed are the LORD that fear,
that walk on in his way.
2 For thou shall feed on thine hands deed
thou happy art I say:
Yea it shall be full well with thee.
3 Thy wife shall be like to
A fruitful Vine, that up by thine
house sides does flourishing grow.
Thy children round thy table found,
as Olive branches are.
4 Behold thus he shall blessed be
that does Jehovah fear
5 From Sion hill Jehovah will
a blessing give thee then:
And thou shall see prosperity
upon Jerusalem;
Even all the days that thy life stays,
6 Yea thou shall see in weal
Thy children then with their children:
and peace on Israel.
PSALM: CXXIX. A song of degrees
NOw from my youth, amy Israel say,
often have they me assaild.
2 They me assaild often, from my youth:
yet against me naught prevaild.
3 The ploughers plowd upon my back,
their furrows long they drew.
4 The righteous LORD ye wickeds cords
did all assunder hew.
5 Let all that Sion hate be shamed,
at once turned back also.
6 As grass on houses tops, be they,
that fades ere up it grow.
7 Whereof enough to fill his hand,
the mower does not find:
Nor therewith he his bossom fills
that up the shoaves does b^nd.
8 Nor do they say that pass by them,
Gods blessing on you be:
Unto (...) Jehovahs Name
a bles^^ng wi^h do we.
PSALM: CXXX. A song of degrees.
LORD from the deep I cried to thee.
2 My voice LORD do thou hea^;
Unto my supplications voice

3 LORD, who should stand* if thou O LORD

4 But with thee there forgiveness (...):

6 (...) ^orning watchers watch for morn

7 Let Israel for Jehovah stay,
in way^^ng hopefully:
Because that with Jehovah there
is kind benignity.
8 Yea plenteous redemption
there is with him likewise:
And he will Israel redeem
from all is iniquities.
PSALM: CXXXI. A song of degree^ of David
MY heart's not haughty LORD,
nor lof^y are mine eyes:
In things too great, or high for me
is not mine exercise.
2 My self I surely have
composed, and made to rest:
Like as a child that weaned is
from off his mothers breast.
I Am like a weaned child.
3 Let Israel then stay
With expectation on the LORD,
from henceforth and for ay.
PSALM: CXXXII. A song of degrees.
REmember David LORD:
and all is affliction.
2 How to the LORD he swore, and vowed
to Jacobs Mighty one.
3 I surely will not go
my houses rent into*
Upon the palace of my bed
I thither will not go.
4 I will not verily
give sleep unto mine eyes:
Nor slumber to mine eyelids give
will I in any wise.
5 Until that for the LORD*
I do find out a seat:
A fixed habitation
for Jacobs God so great.
6 Behold at Ephrat^^,
there did we of it h^^r:
And we within the helds of th'wood
did find it to be there.
7 We Will go into his tents,
and at his footstool bow.
8 Into thy rest ari^^ LORD: thou
th'Arke of thy strength also.
9 Oh let with righteousness
thy Priests themselves array:
And grant unto thy holy ones,
that shout for joy they may.
10 Let not for David's sake
that servant is to thee:
The face of thine anointed one,
away quite turned be.
11 The LORD to David swear
truth; he will not ^urn from it,
I of thy bodies fruit will make
upon thy throne to sit.
12 My Covenant if thy sonns
and Law I teach them hold:
Upon thy throne for evermore
sit then their children should.
13 Because Jehovah has*
made choice of Sion-hill:
He has desired it to be
the place (...) d^ell he will.
14 This is my resting place
to (...):
Here will I dwell, and that because
desired it have I:
15 Bless her provision
abundantly I will:
The poor that (...) in her with bread,
by me shall have their fill.
16 Her Priests with saving health,
them also cloth will I:
Her holy one^ likewise they shall
shout forth most joyfully.
17 The horn of David I
will make to bud forth there:
A candle I prepared have
for mine anointed dear.
18 His enemies will I
with shame apparel them:
But flourishing upon himself
shall be his Diadem.
PSALM: CXXXIII. A song of degrees of David.
HOw good and sweet oh see

Together in unity.
2 It Is like cho^ec oil that sell

HOw good it is O see,

For it is sweet to his name to sing.

And Israel for his precious thing.
5 For that the LORD is great I know,
And over all gods our LORD keeps.
6 What he does will* the LORD does do

8 First born of Egypt smite did he,
Of mankind* and of beast also.

All kingdoms of the Cananites.

Eyes have they, but they do not see,

18 They that them make alike them be,
That trust in them so each one is.
19 O Isr^els house the LORD bless ye,

Who fear the LORD him bless let them
From Sion blessed be the LORD,
Who dwells at ^erusalem.

PSALM: CXXXVII.
THe rivers on of Babylon
there when we did sit down*
Yea sadly then we mourned when
we Sion thought upon.
2 Our Ha^p^ we did hang it amid
upon the willow tree:
Because there they that us away
led in captivity.
3 Required of us a son^ and thus
asked mirth, us wast who laid:
Sing us among a Sions song*
then unto us they s^id.
4 Oh how shall we whilst that we be
in strangers land accord.
To sing a song that d^^h belong
unto our God the LORD?
5 If I of thee forgetful be
O thou Jerusalem,
Let my right hand of her command
be quite forgetful then.
6 Let cleave my tongue my pallat on,
if mind thee do not I:
If choice joys ore I mind not more
Jerusalem my joy.
7 Remember LORD Edoms sons word*
unto the ground said they
It raze, it raze; when as it was
Jerusalem her day.

13 For thou my reine^ possessed ^ast,

Within my mothers womb thou have.

Because that I am fac^on'd thus

And that thy works are m^rveilous,

And when that I was facioned

19 O God thou surely wilt them slay,

PSALM: CXL. To the chief musi^^^n, A Psalm of David.
LORD free me from the evil man,
from violent men save me,
2 Whose hearts think mischief every day
for war they gathered be.
3 They in such wise make sharp their tongue
like as the Serpents do:
And underneath their lips does ly
the Adders poison too. Sela^*
4 Keep me LORD from ye wickeds hand
from violent men me save:
My goings which to overthrow,
in thought projected have.
5 The proud have hid a snare for me,
with coards also, a net,
They spread abroad besides the way,
for me they grins have set. Selah*
6 Unto Jehovah I did say*
thou art ^ God to me:
LORD he^^ the voice of my requests,
which are for grace (...).
7 O GOD the LORD who art ye strength
of my salvation
My head by thee has covered been,
the day of battle on.
8 That man's desire that wicked is
Jehovah do not grant:
His wicked purpose further not,
lest they themselves should vaunt.
9 The head of them on every side,
that do encomp^ss me:
O let the mischief of their lips,
to them a covering be.
10 Let burning co^les on them be cast,
he shall make them to fall:
Into the fire, into deep pits,
to rise no more at all.
11 Let not in the earth established be
a man of evil tongue:
Evil shall hunt to overthrow,
the man of violent wrong.
12 Th'afflicteds cause, ye poor man's right
I know GOD will mentain.
11 Yea just shall praise thy Name, th'upright
shall before thy face remain.
PSALM: CXLI. A Psalm of David.
JEhovah I upon thee call.
O make thou have to me:
And harken thou unto my voice,

And of my soul the lifting up.
as evening sacrifice.
3 Jehovah O that thou would set
a watch my mouth before,
And also of my lips be thou
the keeper of the door.
4 Bow not my heart to any ill,
to do a wicked deed:
With men that mischief work, nor let
me of their ^ainties feed.
5 The just let smite me, kindness it is,
let him reprove me ^ke.
It shall be such a precious ill,
my head it shall not break.
For yet my (...), even in their woes.

So all about the mouth of graves,

8 But unto thee O GOD the LORD,
directed are mine eyes:
My soul O leave not destitute,
on thee my hope relyes.
9 O do thou keep me from the snar^
which they have laid for me:
And also from the grins of those
that work iniquity.
10 But let them all that wicked are
into their own net fall:
Until that altogether I
escape in safety shall.
PSALM: CXLII. Maschil of David. A prayer when he was in the cave.
UNto Jehovah with my voice,
I out aloud did cry:
Unto Jehovah with my voice*
my suit for grace made I.
2 Before his face I did pour out
my meditation:
Before his face I did declare
the trouble me upon.
3 When in me was my spirit over whelmd
then thou did know my way:
In The way I walked, a snare for me
they privily did lay
4 On my right hand I tookt and saw,
but no man would me know:
All refuge faild me, for my soul
none any care did show.
5 Unto the LORD I cried, and said,
my hope thou art alone:
And in land of living ones,
thou art my portion.
6 Because I am brought very low,
attend unto my cry:
From my pursuers save thou me.
which stronger be then I.
7 From out of prison bring my soul,
that I thy Name may praise:
The (...) shall compass me, for thou
shall show me bounteous grace.
PSALM: CXLIII. A Psalm of David.
LORD hear my prayr, give ^ar when I
do humbly ca^^ on thee:
Both in thy truth, and righteousness
make answer unto me.
2 And into judgment enter not.
with him that serves thee:
For in thy sight no man that lives
shall justified be.
3 For the enemy has pursued my soul.
my life to the ground has thrown:
And made me dwell in the dark, like them
that dead are long agone.
4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed,
perplexedly in me:
My heart also within me is
made desolate to be.
5 I call to mind the days of old,
I meditation use:
On all thy works, thy handy work
I thereupon do mus^.
6 Morover I do unto thee,
reach mine out stretched hands:
So after thee my soul does thirst,
as do the thirsty lands. Selah.
(2)
7 Have LORD, hear me, my spirit does f^^l
hide not thy face me f^o:
Lest I ^ecome like unto them,
that down to pit do go.
8 Let me thy mercy early hear,
for I upon thee stay;
Wherein that I should walk, cause thee
to understand the way.
For I to thee lift up my soul.
9 O LORD deliver me,
From them that be my foes; I fly
to hide my self with thee.
10 Thou art my God, thy spirit is good.
teach me thy will to do:
Into the land of uprightness.
conduct thou me also.
11 Jehovah me O quicken thou,
even for thine own Names sake:
And for thy righteousness my soul
from out of trouble take.
12 And cut thou off mine enemies,
in thy benignity:
Destroy all that afflict my soul,
for servant thine am I.
PSALM: CXLIIII. A Psalm of David.
O Let Jehovah blessed be,

Who does instruct my hands to war,

My shield, my crust, which does subdue
my people under me.
3 LORD what is earthly man that thou

Or son of wretched man that thou

4 Man's like to vanity: his days

9 O God new songs I Will sing to thee,
upon the Psaltery:
And on ten stringed instrument,

free from the hurtful sword.

And their right hand, a right hand is

CHAP I.
LET him with kisses of his mouth,
be pleased me to kiss*
Because much better then ye wine,
thy loving kindness i^
3 Thy name as poured forth ointment is*
because of that sweet smell
Of thy good oyntmen^s, therefore do
the virgins love thee well.
4 O draw thou me and readily
we will run after thee:
Into his secret chambers has
the King conducted me*
We will be glad, and we likewise
in thee will much delight*
We will remember more then wine
thy love; thee love th'upright.
5 O daughters of Jerusalem.
I am a comely one,
Though black, as Kedars tents, and as
curtains of Solomon.
6 Because I blackish (...), therefore
upon me look not ye,
Because that with his beams the Sun
has looked down on me.
My mothers sonn^ were wroth with me*
they vinyards me assign
To keep; whereas I have not kept
the vineyard that was mine.
7 Tell me thou whom my soul does (...)*
where thou thy feed do take*
And also where at noon time thou
thy flock to rest do make:
Because O wherefore should I be
like to such va^^ed ones,
That turn aside unto the flocks
of thy companions.
8 Most fair of women know thou not*
thou by the flocks-steps go:
Forth on thy way by shepherds tents,
feed thou thy kids also.
^ To troops of horse in Pharoahs coach,
my love I thee compare.
10 Thy neck with chains, with jewels rows,
thy cheeks f^ll comely are.
11 Borders of gold, with silvar studd^,
for thee make up we will
12 Whil^st that the King at's table fits*
my spikenard yields her smell.
13 Like as of Mirth a bundle is
my welbelov'd to me:
Through all the night betwixt my breasts,
his lodging place shall be.
14 My love as in Engeddys vines,
like Camphires bunch to me.
15 Lo fair my love, lo fair thou art;
thine eyes as doves eyes be.
16 Lo thou art fair, my love, and sweet*
our bed is green likewise:
Our houses beams of Cedars are,
of fi^r our galleries.
CHAP: II.
I Sharons rose, and lilly am
that grows the vales along.
2 As lilly is amongst thorns* my love
the daughters is among.
3 As is the Apple tree among
trees in the wood that grow:
My wellbeloved one amongst
the sonns is even so.
I with great joy sat in his shade,
his fruits I swe^t did taste.
4 He brought me to his house of wine,
his love-flag over me cast.
5 With staggo^s stay; with apples me
cheer up (...) sick I
6 Under my head his left hand does
his right about me ly.
7 O daughters of Jerusalem,
my love w^^ke not, not raise,
By Roes, and hinds of held, I you
do charge, ^^till he please.
8 The voice of my beloved one
upon the mountains, lo
He comes leaping on the hills,
he skipping is also.
9 As Roes o^ ^a^nes of Hinds my love,
behold he stands, and views,
Behind our wall, the window through,
himself through lattess shows.
10 My wellbeloved he did speak,
and unto me did say*
Arise my love, my comely one,
come thou also away.
11 For lo the winter passed is,
the rain is overgone.
12 The flowers appear upon the earth,
birds singing time is come:
And of the Turtle dove the voice
is heard our land within.
13 The figtree causes forth to spring*
her figs that yet are green
The vines also, with tender grape,
do give good smell I say*
Arise my love, my comely one,
and do thou come away.
14 My dove, in the ^ocky cl^fts, close stairs
thy voice O let me hear,
And see thy face, for sweet's thy voice,
thy face is also fair.
15 Take us the foxes, take for us
the little (...) here,
That spoil the vines; because our vines
(...) tender grapes do bear.
16 My welbeloved one is mine,
and I am also his:
Amongst the lilly-flowrs also
his pleasant ^eeding is.
17 Until day break, and shades fly hence*
turn my beloved one,
And like a Roe, or young Heart be
the Bether mountains on.
CHAP: III.
MY souls love I by night did seek,
as I on bed did ly:
Although that I for him did seek,
yet find him could not I.
2 Now I Will arise, and in the streets,
(...) streets of City round:
I will him seek whom my soul loves
I sought, but not him found.
3 As they about the City went
the watchmen found out me:
To whom I said, him whom my soul
does love, O did you see?
4 It was but as a little space
that I from them had past:
But whom my soul did love* I found,
and then I held him fast.
I would not suffer him to go,
till I had brought him in
My mothers house* the chamber (...)
conceived I had bin.
5 O daughters of Jerusalem,
my love (...) not, nor raise,
By Roes, and (...) of (...), I (...)

6 Who Is this from desert that ascends,
like smo^k^e pillars tall,
Perfumed with mirth and frankincense,
'bove merchants powders all.
7 Behold the bed the which is his,
the which is Solomon's:
About it (...) valiant men
of Isreal's valiant ones.
8 They all of them do handle swords,
they expert are in fight:
Each man his sword has on his thigh

LO fair thou art my love* lo fair,
doves eyes in thy locks are:
Thy hair as flocks of goats that from
mount Gilead do appear.

which from the washing come,
Where every one of them bear^ twinns,
of them there is ba^^on none.
3 Thy lips are as a scarlet thread,
thy speech eke comely is:
Within thy locks thy temples ar^
like a pomgranate piece.
4 Thy neck is like to David's tower,
built for an armory,
Where hang a thousand shields, all shields
of men of potency.
5 Thy breasts they twain compared are
to Ro^^ a couple young:
The which are twins, and have their feed*
the lilly-flowrs among.
6 Until the time the day shall break,
and till the shades (...) hence.
I Will get me to the mounts of mirth,
and hill of frankincense.
7 All fair thou art my lovely one*
there is no spot in thee.
8 My spouse with me from Leb'non come

Look from the top of Amanah,

From Hermon, from the Lions dens*
the Leopards mountains fro.
9 My sister spouse thou ravishest

My heart with that one eye of thine,
with one chain of thy neck.
10 How fair's thy love, my sister spouse,
how better far thy love
Then wine; and thine anoyntments smell*
all spices far above.
11 My spouse thy lips drop honey comb,
both honey and milk are on
Thy tongue, and thy cloths smell is like
the smell of Lebanon.
12 My sister my espoused one,
a garden closely ^^utt:
A wellspring closed up thee is,
a fountain sealed up.
13 Thy cyo^^ of Pomgranates are.
like to a Paradise.
With pleasant fruits replenished.
Camphire, (...) likewise.
14 Spiknard, and Saffron, Calamus*

All Incense trees, Myrrh* Aloes,

And I my Myrrh have gathered up,

Eat O ye friends, drink O beloved,

4 My well beloved put his hand

My bowels made a troubled noise
in me for him therefore.
5 I rose, to open to my love*
and my hands Mirrh did (...)*
My fingers eke sweet Mirrh upon
(...) handles of the lock.
6 When I the door had opened,
to my beloved one,
Then had my love withdrawn himself*
and he away was gone:
When as he spoke, my soul did fayl,
although I sought him have,
I found him not, I called him, yet
he me no answer gave.
7 The w^tchmen that the City round*
me found, smite, wound did they,
The keepers of the walls from me
did take my veyl away.
8 O daughters of Jerusalem,
I charge you to him say,
If my beloved ye (...)
for love do faint away.
9 What Is thy love more then others loves
fairest of women kind*
What Is thy love more then others love,
that us thou do so bind*
10 My love is white, and ruddy, chief
amongst ten thousands he.
11 His head is gold most fine, his locks
curled, black, as Ravens be.
12 His eyes as doves, by water-streams,
with milk washed, set full meet.
13 His cheeks, are as a bed of spice,
as flowers of odours sweet:
His lilly-lips, drop flowing Mirrh,
his hands gold rings bedight.
14 With Ber^^ll laid, with Saphires is
his belly Ivory bright.
15 His legs, as Marble pillars, set
on sockets of fine gold:
His look as Lebanon, as choice
as Cedars to behold.
16 Most sweet his palla^ lovely he^
Even altogether is:
O daughters of Jerusalem,
my love, and friend is this.
CHAP: VI.
FAirest of women* whither i^
thy loved gone away*
Where is thy love by-turn'd, that so
seek him with thee we may.
2 My love to 's gardens down is gone*
into the beds of spice*
To feed in gardens, and to get
the lilly-flowrs likewise.
3 I am for my beloved one,
and my beloved for me:
And feed among the lilly-flowers
continually does he.
4 Thou art my love as T^rz^ neat,
fair as Jerusalem.
Yea* terrible, as is an host,
that does with banners stream.
5 Turn thou from me thine eyes, because
they have me overcome:
Thine hair is as a flock of goats,
which look from Gilead down.
6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep,
up from the washing gone,
Whereof each one bears twinns, of them
there is not a barren one.
7 And in such wise within thy locks,
thy temples placed are:
That to a piece of Pomgranate,
the same I may compare.
8 Or Queens threescore, and fourscore is
of concubins the count,
There are so many Virgin^ as
all number do surmount.
9 My dove, my undefiled one*
she is her mothers one:
Of her that did her (...) alone*
she is the choicest one*
The daughters, when they her beheld.
they did her blessed call,
Yea both the Queens, and concubins,
they praised her withal.
10 Who Is she yt looks as morning forth,
fair as the Moon so bright*
Clear as the Sun, and terrible
as hoasts with ^^nners ^ight?
11 To The garden of the nuts I went
down, valley fruits to see:
To see, if Vines did bud, if bloom
did the Pomgranate tree.
12 My soul had placed me before
I ever was aware,
Upon the charriots of them that
my willing people are.
13 Turn, turn, O ^hulamite, turn, turn*
that we may look on thee:
What will you see in the Shulamite*
as two camps company.
CHAP: VII.

4 Thy neck is also like unto

B^th-rabbi^s entrance by:
Thy nose as towr of Lebanon,

5 Thine head on thee, like Carmell is,
hair of thy head likewise
Like purple is; the King is held
within the galleries.
6 How fair and delicate art thou,
O love, for pleasan^ie!
7 This stature thine, is like the Palm,
thy breasts, as cluster^ be.
8 I said I will the Palm ascend,
the boughs thereof I held:
L^ke to Vine clusters are thy breasts,
thy nose as Apples smeld.
9 And as best wine, thy pallat is,
that to my love runns sweet,
C^^sing the lips to utter speech,
of those that are asleep.
10 I am my loves, (...)

If that the tender grape appear,

If that they bud, and there my love^
I will on thee bestow.
13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at
our gates all sweet fruits be,
Both new, and old, O my beloved,
which I have stored for thee.
CHAP: VIII.
O That thou as my brother wort,
that sucked my mothers breast,
I would thee find without, and kiss,
yet none should me infest.
2 I to my mothers house would lead*
and bring thee, who taught me:
Spic't wine of my Pomgranate juice,
to drink I would cause thee.
3 His left hand underneath my head,
and right should me embrace.
4 O daughters of Jerusalem*
I charge you till he please*
Not to stir up, nor to awake.
my wellbeloved one.
5 But who is this ^ea^es on her love,
that does from des^^t come:
There where thy mother thee conceived,
undertake Apple tree:
Where she thee ba^e, who brought thee fort^
I there up-raysed thee.
6 Me as (...) on thy heart,

For love is strong as death, and fierce
as hell, is jealous zeal.
The coals thereof, are coals of fire,
most ardent is its fla^e.
7 Much waters cannot quench this love,
nor can floods drown the same:
If all the substance of his house
a man would give for love.
It neverless would utterly
a price contemned prove.
8 A little sister it is we have,
but yet no breasts has thee:
What shall we for ou^ sister do,
when she be-spoke shall be*
9 A s^^va^ towr wee'^ ^n her build,
if that a wall ^ee be,
And i^ a door, then her enclose,
with Cedar boards will we.
10 I am a wall, like unto tow^s,
my breasts they ^re likewise*
Like unto one that favor found,
then was I in his eyes.
11 At Baal-hammon. Solomon
a vineyard had, and he
The vineyard ^^red out* to them

Each one a thousand ^^^varlings
was for it is fruit to pay.
12 The vineyard that is mine, before
my presence is always:
Thy part O Solomon unto

Those that do keep the fruit thereof,
two hundred have likewise.

Unto thy voice attending be,
cause thou me it to hea^.

my wellbeloved one:
Or be thou like a fawn of Hearts*

Here ends the Song of Solomon.
THE SONGS IN THE PROPHET ISAIAH.
CHAP: V.
NOw I to my beloved will
A song of my loves vinyard sing,
He has a vineyard on a hill
Which in the horn of sto^e does spring.
2 He fenc't it, and it^ stones out threw
And planted it with choicest Vine,
Amid'st it built a towr also,
And therein made a press for wine:
He looked grapes it should yield then*
But sowr-wild-grapes it forth did bring*
3 Now dwellers in Jerusalem,
And men of Judah, judge this thing
Between my Vineyard, now, and me.
4 What to it could I have done more*
Yet when I looked its grapes to see,
Why brought it forth wild-grapes therefore*
5 And now I Will tell you, what I Will do,
My Vineyards hedge remove will I,
To be devoured, and I Will down throw,
It Is wall, and it trod down shall ly.
6 And it for desolate I Will say,
Unp^un'd, undig^d, with brambles spread,
And thorns; and to the clouds I Will say
That they on it no rain shall shed.
7 Because the house of Israel,
The LORD of hoasts his vineyard is:
The men in Judahs tribe that dwell.
They are that pleasant plant of his*
And he for judgment did expect,
But lo there an oppressing wound;
An^ that they justice should effect,
But lo an outcry there h^^ (...).
CHAP: XII.
JEhovah, I will give thee praise,
though thou wast wroth with me:
Thine anger turned is away,
and thou do comfort me.
2 Lo, God is my salvation,
trust, and naught fear will I:
Because the LORD Jehovah is
my strength, and melody,
And he is my salvation.
3 With joy shall ye therefore
Out of the well^ of saving health
draw waters forth i^ store.
(2)
4 Praise ye the LORD, call on his nam^*
amongst the people show
His doings; that his name's extolld.
declare abroad also.
5 Sing ye unto the LORD, for he
things excellent has done:
Yea, throughout all the earth abroad,
the same is fully known.
6 Cry out, and shout aloud, thou that
mount Sion dwellst upon:
For mighty in the midst of thee,
is Isreal's Holy one.
Another Meter.
O LORD I will thee praise,
though thou vast wroth with me*
Thine anger turned is away,
and thou do comfort me,
2 Lo God my safety (...),
trust, and naught fear will I.
Because the LORD Jehovah is
my strength, and melody.
Yea he my safety is.
3 With joy shall ye therefore
Out of the wells of saving health
draw waters forth in store.
4 Ye in that day shall say,
praise GOD, his name proclaim,
Show to the folk his deeds, declare
that lofty is his Name.
5 Sing ye unto the LORD,
because that he has done
The things that are most excellent,
in all the earth it is known.
6 Cry out, and shout, thou loud
that dwel'st mount Sion on:
For mighty in the midst of thee,
is Isreal's Holy one.
LORD you are my God, I Will thee exalt,
I will thy Name confess;
Who wonders do, thy counsels old
are truth and faithfulness.
2 For thou a City made an heap,
walled towns to wast, to fall.
The st^^nger never of the town,
rebuild a palace shall.
3 And for this cause thee gloryfie,
the mighty people shall:
The City of dread nations,
shall reverence thee withal.
4 For thou have been unto the poor
his strong munition:
In his distress thou art the strength
unto the needy one:
Thou art a refuge from the storm,
a shadow from the heat:
When blasts of dr^adfull ones as storms
against the wall do beat.
4 Thou shall bring down the strangers noi^^
as heat in places dry.
As heat by clouds-shade ceast, the branch
of dread ones low shall ly.
(2)
6 The LORD of hoasts morover shall
upon this mountain make,
A sumpteous feast of far things, for
all people to partake:
A feast of wines upon the lees,
for them he shall prepare.
Of (...) ^^rrowy things, of wines.
on lees re^yn'd that are.
7 And in this mountain he destroy
the fa^e of covering shall
Cast over all people and the vail,
spread over nations all.
8 For ever he will swallow up
death into victory:
The LORD God from all faces shall
wipe tears off utterly:
From all the (...) his folks rebuke
he shall ^ake clean away.
9 Lo this our God who will us save,
for him we waiting s^ay:
This is the LORD, on whom we had
ou^ expectation,
We will rejoice, and will be glad
in ^is salvation.
CHAP: XXVI.
WE have a City very strong,
God will appoint salvation
Her w^lls and bulwarks for to be.
2 Set open ye the gates that so
The righteous nation in may go
That does observe the v^^itie:
3 In perfect peace keep him thou will,
Whose thoughtfull mind on thee is built,
Because he does on thee rely.
4 Trust in the LORD for evermore,
For in the LORD Jehovah store
Of strength is to eternity.
5 For he brings down who dwell on high
The lofty City low makes ly:
He lays it low even to the floor,
Even to the dust he has it thrown.
6 The poor man's feet shall tread it down,
The feet and steps of th'needy-poor.
7 Uprightness is the just man's way,
Thou most upright, his path do weigh.
8 Yea in thy judgments way O LORD,
We waited have for thee, the same
Our soul desire is to thy Name,
And thee in mind still to record.
9 My soul has thee desired by night,
Yea, I within me with my sprig^t
In early seeking thee do earn:
For when on ear^h thy judgments be,
The dwel^ers in the world shall see,
That so they righteousness may learn*
10 Let to the wicked grace be ^hown,
Yet righteousness learn will he none;
But in the land of uprightness.
He will both deal unrighteously,
And he Jehovahs Majesty
Will not behold him to redress.
(2)
11 Jehovah when thy hand on high
Is lifted up, they will not see:
But see and be ashamed in all they
With envy at thy folk likewise,
The fire of thy streit enemies
Shall them devour, even quite away.
12 LORD peace for us ordein will thou,
For in us thou have wrought also
Even all our works, our God O LORD.
13 Lords others had dominion
Over us, besides thee, but alone
By thee we will thy Name record.
14 They dead are they* shall live no more*
They ^re deceased* they therefore
Shall not arise, because thou have
Them visitted, and have them all
D^stroy'd, and their memorial
Thou quite have made away to wast.
15 Jehovah thou the nation
Increased have, the nation
Thou have increast abundantly:
Therefore then gloryfied art,
Thou have removed it far apart,
Where all the ends of the earth do ly.
16 They visit thee, LORD in the hour
Of trouble, out their prayer they pour
On them when thy chastisments light.
17 As she that is to travel nigh,
Is pained, and out of pangs does cry:
So h^ve we been LORD in thy sight.
18 We have conceived, been paind, forth brought
As't were the wind, no health we wrought
In the earth, nor have the worldlings slew
Thy dead, my corpse shall live, and rise
Who dwell in the dust, (...) sing likewise*
For as the dew of he (...) thy dew.
The Earth shall her dead pastor also.
20 My folk, come, to thy chambers go,
And shut thy door, about thee fast*
Hide thou thy self now as it were,
But for a little moment there,
Until the wrath be over-past.
21 For lo ye LORD from's place does come
To execute on them the doom*
That do upon the earth remain
Because of their iniquity:
The Earth also shall her blood discry,
And cover shall no more her slain.
CHAP: XXXVIII. The Song of Hezekiah, after (...) recovery from si^kness.
10 I Said in cutting off my days,
Go to the gates of gra^e shall I;
And of the remnant of my years,
I am deprived utterly.
11 I said the LORD I shall not see,
In The land of living ones the LORD.
And man no more behold shall*
With them that dwell within the world.
11 Mine age away from me is put,
And moved as a shepherds tent:
I weaver-like my life off cut,
With plaing sickness be me spent.
Yea from the day the night until.
Thou quite an end of me wilt m^ke.
13 I count from morning, that he will
My bones all as a Lion break:
From day to night thou will me wast.
14 Like Crane, or swallow charter I*
Dove like I mourn, mine eyes (...)-cast
Do fail, LORD help, oppressed am I.
15 What shall I say ^o me he has
Both spoken, and himself done this*
I all my life with softly path,
Shall walk in my souls bitterness.
16 LORD, by these things men live, and thou
By these my spirits life do give:
Thou will recover me also,
And thou will make me for to live.
17 Lo, I for peace, sharp grief did find,
But freed my soul in love thou have
From pits corruption: for behind
Thy back thou all my sins did cast.
18 For graves thy praise cannot make known
Nor yet c^n death thee celebrate:
S^^h ^s into the pit go down*
They for thy truth no more can wait.
19 The living, he, the living will
Thee praise, as I this d^y have done:
The father to the children still,
He shall thy faithfulness make known.

Therefore (...) in the LORD (...)

Throughout our life, even all the (...)*
THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH.
CHAP: III.
I Am the man by'^ wrathf^ll (...):
who have of grief the fight.
2 To darkness he me led, and brought
and not into ye light.
3 He Is surely turned against me, all day
his hand he turns in wrath.
4 My flesh and skin, he has made old
my bones he b^oken has.
5 He against me^ built, and ^e with (...)
and travel did infold.
6 He has me set in places dark,
as who are dea^ of old.
7 He me hedged in. I cannot get ou^:
his heavy cha'n I bear.
8 Also when as I cry, and shout,
he shuts out my prayer.
9 He with hew'n stone enclosed my path
he crooked made my ways.
10 He as a Bear, (...) wait for me,
as Lions in hid place.
^^ He turned has my ways asid^,
and he has pulled me
A^ into pieces: he has made
me desolate to be.
12 He bent his bow, me (...) a mark
did for the arrow place.
13 His quivers strows he has caus^^
into me (...) to pass.
14 To all my folk, I was a scorn:
and all the day their song.
15 He made me full of bitterness,
and drunck with wormwood strong.
16 And he my teeth with gravel brake,
in ashes rolled me.
17 And far thou put'st my soul from peace
gone is prosperity.
18 Yea I did say, my strength and hope,
is perished from the LORD.
19 My grief and pain, wormwood and gall,
when I in mind record.
20 My soul does them remember still*
and in mee's humbled sore.
21 This to my heart I do recall,
and hope I have therefore.
22 It Is of the mercys of the LORD
wee'^ not consumed away:
Because that his compassions
they never do decay.
23 They every morning are renu'd,
his faithfullness is great.
24 The LORD's my portion says my soul
thence hope on him I Will set.
25 To them that wait for him, to the soul
that seeks him, good's the LORD,
26 It Is good to hope, and still to wait*
for safety from the LORD.
(2)
27 It is good for a man in's youth
that he has born the yoke.
28 He sits alone, and silence keeps*
because it was his stroke.
29 He puts his mouth into the dust,
if so there hope may be.
30 His cheek to him that smites he gives,
filled with reproach is he.
31 For ay the LORD will not cast off,
but though grie^ cause he should,
32 Yet will he have compassion
in's mercyes manifold.
33 For he afflicts not willingly*
nor grieves the sonns of men.
34 To crush in pieces under's feet
earths prisoners all of them.
35 To turn aside the right of man
before the high it his face*
36 The LORD approves not to subvert
a man in his just case.
37 Who Is he that says, and done it is,
unless the LORD it will.
38 Out of the mouth of the most high
proceeds not good, and ill.
39 Why does a living man complain*
a man for his sins pain?
40 Let Us search, and try our ways, and turn
unto the LORD again.
41 Let us lift up our heart, and hands,
to God on high in heaven.
42 We trespast have, and have rebelled,
and thou have not forgiven.
(3)
43 Thou hyd'st with wrath, and us pursu'st
thou slay'st, and do not rue.
44 Thou so with clouds do hide thy self
our prayer cannot pass through
45 Amidst the people us thou made
the refuse scum likewise.
46 Against us opened have their mouths
all of our enemies.
47 Fear and snare is come on us,
wast and destruction.
48 For my folks daughters wast, mine eye
runs water-rivers down.
49 Mine eye with tears does trickle down
no intermission.
50 Until the LORD from heaven look down
on our affliction.
51 Mine eye affects mine heart, for all
my Citty's daughters sore.
52 Me like a bird, my foes pursued,
they have no cause therefore.
53 My life in the dungeon they cut off,
on me a stone they put.
54 The waters did flow over rain head.
I said I off am cut.
55 I called on thy name O LORD*
out of the dungeon low.
56 Thou hard'st my voice, hide not thine ear*
my cry, my breathing fro.
57 Thou ^rewest near, and said fear not
in the day I called on thee.
58 LORD, my souls causes thou did plead,
my life thou have set free.
59 Jehov^h thou have seen my wrong,
judge thou the cause for me.
60 Their vengeance all, and all their plots
against me thou did see
61 Thou have heard their reproach O Lord
their plots against me always.
62 The lips of those who against me rose*
their plots against me all day.
63 Their sitting down, their rising up,
their music lo am I.
64 O LORD on them a recompense
to their hands works apply.
65 Give to them senslesnes of heart,
thy curse to them afford.
66 In wrath chase, and them wast beneath
the heavens of the LORD.
CHAP: V.

3 We orphans are, and fatherless,
our mothers widows are.
4 Our water we for money drunk,
our wood is sold us dear.
5 Our necks in persecution are,
we toil, no rest we have.
6 For fill of bread to Egypt we
and hand to Ashur gave.
7 Our fathers sinned, and are no more,
and born their sin have we.
8 Us servants rule, out of their hands
there is none to set us free.
9 (...) of life, for deserts sword
we gate the bread we lack.
10 Because of dreadful dearth, our skin
is like an oven black.
11 They women fore'^ in Sion, maids
in Judahs Cittys there.
12 Princes were hanged up by there hands:
not honored th'Elders were.
13 They took young men to gr^nd, the child
fell under wood also.
14 The Elders ceased from the gate,
young men their music fro.
15 Our ha^ts joy ceased is, to moanes
our daunces turned be.
16 The crown is fallen from our head,
woe to us, sinned have we,
17 For this our heart is faint, for this
our eyes are dimm become.
18 For Sions hill that wasted is,
the foxes walk thereon.
19 Thy throne LORD is from age to age*
thou do remain always.
^0 Wherefore do thou forget ^s ay.
us leave for length of days.
21 Turn us to thee, LORD turn we shall,

The Prayer of JONAH, to the LORD his God, out of the fishes belly.
2 I To the LORD from my distress
did cry, and he gave ear:
Out of ^ells belly I did cry,
and he my voice did hear.
3 Into the deep, and midst of Seas,
because thou did me cast:
The floods me compast, all thy wav^*
and billows over me past.
4 Then did I say, I utterly
cast from thy sight remain:
Thy holy Temple yet will I
toward it look again.
5 The waters even to the soul
did me encompass round:
The depths me round enclosed, the weeds
about my head were bound.
6 To mountains bottoms I went down,
earths bars me ay beset:
Yet LORD my God thou broughtst my life
up from corruptions-pit.
7 When as my soul did faint in me,
thee LORD remembered I,
And in my prayr came unto thee,
into thy Sanctuary.
8 They their own mercyes leave, that do
mark lying vanities.
9 But with the voice of giving thanks,
to thee I Will sacrifice:
The thing the which I vowed have
to pay I will accord;
Because alone salvation,
proceeds from the LORD.
A PRAYER OF HABAKKUK the Prophet upon Sig^^noth.
CHAP: III.
THy speech O LORD I heard with fears,
Revive in midst of years O LORD
Thy work: make known in midst of years
In wrath thy tender grace record.
3 God forth from Teman saved.
The Holy one from Paran hill: Selah
The skies his glory overspread,
And all the earth his praise did fill.
4 His brightness did as light appear.
Horns from his hand proceeded rhence:
The hiding of his strength was there.
5 Before him w^nt the Pestelence,
And from his feet coale^ burning went.
6 He stood, and the earth he measured,
He looked, and the nations rent,
Ay lasting hills were scattered.
The hills of perpetuity
Did bow, his ways for ever stand.
7 In anguish Cushans tents saw I,
The curtains shook of Midians land.
8 What did ye floods the LORD displease
What was thine ire against rivers wide?
What was thy wrath against the Seas?
That thou did on thy horses ride.
Thy charriots of salvation were.
* 9 Made wholly naked was thy bow,
As thou to the tribes did say and swear.
The earth with rivers cleave did thou.
10 Thee saw* and shook ye mountains stee^
The floods of waters passed by:
His voice forth utter did the deep,
And lifted up his hands on high.
11 The Sun, and eke the Moon so bright,
Stood still within their dwelling sphere,
They moved at thine arrows light,
At th'shining of thy glittering spear.
12 Thou did ma^ch through the land in wrath*
The heathen thou did thresh in r^ge.
13 Thou forth also did make thy path,
For safety of thy heritage:
For safety with thine oynted one:
Thou from the wickeds house the head
* Did wound: so the foundation
Was to the neck discovered
14 Thou of his villages the head
Did with his staves strike through the same
That me they might have scattered.
Like as a whirlwind out they came:
It Was their re^oycing to devour,
The poor afflicted secretly.
15 Thou with thine horses went in pow^
Through Se^^, and he^ps of waters high.
16 (...)* my ^^lly trembled then,
And at thy voice my lips did quake*
A oftenness my bones came in,
And I within my self did shake:
That in the day of trouble so
I might in quietness sit still:
When he ascends the people to
Them with his troops invade he will.
17 Though figtree blossom not at all.
Nor any fruit in vines appear,
The labor of the Olive fail,
And though ye fields no men should bear*
Though flocks shall be cut off from fold.
In stall no herd, should have abode.
18 Yet in the LORD rejoice I would.
I Will joy in my salvations God:
The LORD God is my strength, and he
Does make my feet like Hinds also.
And he it is that causes me
Upon my places high to go.
The Song of the blessed virgin MARY.
Luke 1. verse 46.
MY soul does Magnify the LORD.
47 My spirit is glad also
In God my Savior. Who (...)
his handmaids state so low:
For lo, henceforth all ages shall

49 For me the strong, great things has done.
and Holy is his Name.
50 Such also as him reverence,
his mercy is upon:
And that from generation,
to generation.
51 He with his (...) has showed strength
the ^roud he scattered
In the devises of their heart
which they imagined.
52 Down from their seat of dignity
the mighty put has he:
And has exalted them on high
that were of low degree.
53 The hungry he has f^ld with good*
the rich sent void away.
54 His servant Israel he has helped
his mercy minding ay.
55 According as he spoke unto
our fathers heretofore:
To Abraham and unto his seed,
henceforth for evermore.
The Song of Zacharias ver. 88.
THe LORD the God of Israel*
be blessed, because that he
Has now his people visited,
and them redeemed free.
69 And us an horn of safety rais^d
in's servant David's house.
70 As by his holy Prophets mouth
he spoken has to us:
Which have been since the world began.
71 That from our enemies,
We should be said, an^ from the hand
of all (...) foes likewise.
72 To grant the mercy promised to
our fathers, and by name,
73 To mind his holy covenants oath
he swear to Abraham*
74 That us from fear, and foes hands f^ee^
to serve him he would give.
75 In holiness and righteousness
before him while we live.
76 Thou child the Prophet of the High'^
shall called be also:
For to prepare his waves thou shall
before the LORDs face go.
77 By pardon of his peoples sins,

78 Whence d^y spring visits us from high
through our Gods mercyes dear.
