By His Excellency Coll. Benjamin Fletcher Captain General and Governor in
Chief of His Majesty's Province of New York, etc. A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS The French and Indians of Canada have lately Invaded the Country of
the Indians of the Five Nations in Amity with the Subjects of the Crown of
England, and have destroyed their Indian Corn. To the end that the said Indians
that have so suffered the loss of their Corn, may be supplied with what is
necessary for their Maintenance for the Year ensuing* I have therefore, by and
with the Advice and Consent of His Majesty's Council for this Province,
Prohibited the Transportation of Indian Corn and Pease from the County of
Albany, Ulster and Duchess County, to any other County or place down the River,
until the first day of April now next ensuing. And all Masters of Sloops, and
other Vessels are hereby prohibited accordingly, as they will answer the
contrary at their peril.

Given at Fort William Henry the Twelfth Day of September, in the Eighth Year
of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord WILLIAM the Third, by the Grace of God, King
of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc. Annoque
Domini 1696.

Ben. Fletcher.
