THE LOYAL ADDRESS OF THE Clergy of Virginia.
MAY it please you dread Sir, we the Clerks of Virginia,
Who pray for Tobacco, and Preach for a Guinea,
Patroon'd to Contempt, and by favor made Elves,
For Troopers are Listed and pay Tithes to our Selves.
The meanest Brigade of Your Majesty's Grubstreets,
Though Late; not least Loyal of Your Clerical Subjects,
Among Crowds of True Hearts that of late do Address You,
In our humble Phrase do Crave Leave to Carress You
To show for Your Safety how with Zeal we burn all,
Under the Reverend James Blare our Colonel.
And here we cannot choose but proclaim our Resentment,
That we mar'l what the Devil the Politic French meant:
In Affront to Your Person, and the Throne that You sit on,
To Dub the Young Bricklair the King of Great Britain.
Though we are not with some so high pufft with the Ptysick,
As to say it is a Breach of the Treaty of Reswick;
Yet we boldly averr, and by Words do assure it
To be such a Contempt, we can never endure it:
Wherefore if Your Foes do persist for to slight You,
We will all of us Pray, nay and some of us Fight too:
For like Hogans half drunk, Your Polemicks I fancy
Can Club pretty well when Inspired with Nantsy,
Among all the Black Guard You Cannot miss of an Hector,
Unless You chance light on the Williamburg Rector:
Yet we'll favor the French if we find they will be Civil,
For be it known that we fear 'em no more than the Devil:
However we chan huff it, if they never come near us,
If they should I am afraid they would damnably scare us*
Then to save our own Skins, and to silence Gainsaiers,
We'll leave of our bouncing and fall to our Prayers.
May kind Heavens preserve long Your Majesty's good Soul,
And bring Lewis to beg a loathed life at Your Footstool:
May Mantanoon Pox his Black Soul to the Devil,
And Burgundy Rot with his putred Kings Evil:
May young D' Anjoy be trust at the arm of the Main-yard,
And Austria possess the Command of the Spaniard:
May all Factious Distinctions henceforth be forgotten,
Nor Your Spiritual Pedlers be Contrould by a Scotch one:
May your Health in your College go Loyally Round,
And all your Liege People have Twelve-pence a Pound.
