At a Sessions of the GENERAL COURT Held at Boston the 4th. of March 1680.
WHereas some Persons on misunderstanding of the Laws formerly made against
selling Arms and Ammunition to Indians, have been ready to transgress in that
matter, This Court therefore sees cause, and do hereby revive that Law Tit.
Indians, Sect. 2. strictly inhibiting all Persons from Giving, Selling,
Bartering directly or indirectly, Guns, Powder, Shot, Lead, Arms or Ammunition
to any Indian whatsoever, or mending or repairing Guns etc. as in said Law is
expressed, on the pains and penaltyes therein contained, any Law, Custom or
Usage to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided always, that it shall be
lawful for our Commissioners of the Colonyes for the time being, by Note under
their hands, to allow to our friend Indians, for necessary use, small
quantityes, not exceeding half a pound of Powder to one man at one time, and
proportionably Shot or Lead.

By the COURT, Edward Rawson Secr'.
