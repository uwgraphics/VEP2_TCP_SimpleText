A CARD.
MR. Axe and Mr. Hammer being solicited by a Number of their Brother
Freeholders and Freemen of the City of New York, to return their hearty Thanks
to their good Friends, Mr. Hatchway and Mr. Bowline, have consented, -- and
think proper to do it in this public Manner; -- and to assure them, that the
Leather-Aprons (a very respectable Body) are clearly of their Opinion, That it
is TRADE, and not LAW supports our Families: -- And honest Jolt the Cartman,
says he never got Sixpence for riding Law Books, though he gets many Pounds from
the Merchants, -- So that with many Thanks for your sensible good Card -- we
all say, as you say, --

NO LAWYER IN THE ASSEMBLY. --

Tradesman's-Hall, 29 th February, 1768.
