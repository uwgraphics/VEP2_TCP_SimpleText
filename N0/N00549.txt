To His Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Captain General and Governor in Chief of
Their Majesty's Province of New York, Province of Pennsilvania, Country of
New Castle, Territories and Tracts of Land depending thereon in America,
Vice Admiral of the same.
The humble Address of the Mayor, Recorder, Alder-men and Commonality of their
Majesty's City of New York, convened in Common Council.
May it please your Excellency;
WE, the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen and Assistants of this their Majesty's City
of NEW YORK; convened in Common Council, having in our Consideration the great
Happiness that has attended this Province in general, and the particular
Advantages that has accrewed to this Their Majesty's City and Corporation since
the auspicious Day of your Excellency's arrival to Govern us, cannot but with
all Thankfullness acknowledge, That so great Benefits have only proceeded from
the unparrallel'd Vigilence, Diligence and Conduct of your Excellency, who has
not been wanting in the most difficult Seasons to expose your Person to many
Dangers for Their Majesty's Service, and the Safety of this Province. And being
now Witnesses of the great Pains your Excellency has lately taken at Albany in
reducing the Indians (who were shaking in their Fidelity) to a perfect and firm
Union unto their Majesty's Interest, by which means the Frontiers of this
Provinces are not only strengthened, but the other Remote parts of the
Government freed from the daily Alarms and Incursions of the Enemy.

We therefore, may it please your Excellency, in the deepest Sense of such
signal Favors, with all Duty and hearty Joy, presume to Congratulate your
Excellency's Safe and Happy Return unto this City, the Seat of their Majesty's
Government. And withal do further presume to address unto your Excellency, as
the only Person and Means, next unto their most sacred Majesty's, to whom all
the present Tranquillity of the Government is owing, by whose Prudence all our
Backslidings are healed, and all our late Hearts and Annimosities are buried,
that whose ever passes our Streets can see nothing of the Tokens or Signals of
War, but such Unanimity and Cheerfulness amongst the People, that it is now no
more a Question where we shall pitch our Tabernacle, but in the City, where we
may be influenced and protected by the inestimable Virtue, Prudence and Pious
Conduct of your Excellency.

May it further please your Excellency, As we know there is nothing so
delightful to your Excellency as Truth, so we cannot better demonstrate the
true Affections we bear your Excellency, than by praying your Excellency to
look into our City, and you will find that our Inhabitants are daily erecting
Monuments to perpetuate the Memory of your Excellency's Virtue, wherein we have
an entire Confidence, and will not now detain your Excellency with Repetitions
of former Requests, but only give your Excellency assurance, That as hitherto
the Interest of this City has never been separate from (but the chief and only
Support of) the Prerogative and Dignity of the Crown in this Province, so that
we cannot permit our selves in the least to doubt, but that whilst the
Administration of that Royal Dignity rests in your Excellency's Person, (which
we pray may always be) there can be any change in our Gates, but the Interest
of the KING and the CITY shall be ever one and the same.

In Testimony of our Integrity therein, we with all Humility, offer our Prayers
to Almighty God for the prosperous Success, and the long Lives of our Sovereign
Lord and Lady King William and Queen Mary, and that your Excellency may live
long and Govern us, and be the only Protector of our City, and as such we
humbly pray your Excellency to accept of this CUP of GOLD, in acknowledgement
of the sincere and dutiful Affection that is born to your Excellency, by those
who will always manifest themselves,

May it please your Excellency, Your Excellency's Most Dutiful And Most
Obedient Servants, Stephen de Lancey, Thomas Clarke, Johannis van Despiegel,
Arian van Schaick, Brandt Schuyler, Robert Darkin, Gerard Dowe, Ebenezer
Willson, Theunis de Key, Abraham de Peyster, James Graham, William Beeckman,
William Merr^^t, Johannis Kip,
