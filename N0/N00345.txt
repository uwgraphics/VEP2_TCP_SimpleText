AN Elegiack Tribute to the Sacred D^^t of the Reverend and Worthy Mr. SEABORN
COTTON Pastor of the Church of Christ at HAMPTO^ in New England: who was
discharged from his Work and Office, to be admitted into Heaven, April 20 th
1686.
AMong the weeping wailing Mourners drove,
I come to show my weakness, yet my lo^e^
I shall not I cannot refrain when Grief bids speak,
And Sorrow forces* I choose to seem weak
Rather than stupid; and not for to show
What he deserves and what my Fancies ow
Unto his Horse, which wants no Verse, to whom
A Diap^son of each Muses Moan
Is a due Tribute. ^et Griefs passions spent
Are eased when broach't, cured when they have vent.
If tears and fears, or M^ans and Groans were verse,
How would I, could I, should I grace the Hearse
Of this vast soul; of which the unworthy earth
Was never so much as honored with the Birth.
The grandest birth ere A^phi^rue had*
To rock his Cradle Ange^s they were glad.
By Winds and Waves, and prosperous (...) before
Heaven sent by Sea^^ is (...) soul to show.
(...) whos^ Life (...) w^ll-spent Days
I need to imitate but not to prais
I ever hated flattering of the dead.
(Without all fraud) it may, must, shall be se'd
He was a (...)* Joy, Jewel, Head and Han^,
Light, Life, (...)* Staff, and Oracle of our Land.
Hard things he (...) obscure he brought to Sight,
Feet to the lame he was: to Blind a Light.
Ears to the deaf. Strength to the feeble Knee.
A Mouth to dumb. A Churches eye was he.
Hands to the helples^ ones. Stay to the Weak.
The faint he cheered: to wicked swords he would speak
An heart to heartless. A Souls guide, to keep
And fright off wolves and ^^cked from Chr^^^s sheep.
He drew and drove, wooed, (...) with al^ his might
Men's souls, by love, b^ ^ear, by (...) Fright*
(...) had Body such a Soul within
(...)-hater, and a Thunderbolt to (...)
(...) he stu^^'d, pre^^^^, teacht, pr^ctis'd too!
His (...), works, (...) and life together grew.
A (...) and a M^^ter-peice of Art.
His (...) was full of ^ight, of Gra^^ his heart.
He did not seek the ^hurches Good^ but Good:
'Twas them not theirs ^he sought. O what a brood
His sed'lous care, lov^, labor, bred, fed, raised!
What earth does hide, (...) heaven will be praised
Modest, mild, meek was (...). A gracious grave
Pattern and Patron. (...) to strive to save
He made his work his w^ges. Souls to gain
He nere grutcht time, (...), life, strength or pai^
To make souls start, smart, feel to heal, (...) spared
No cost, no means: let Heaven regard, reward.
One while he would draw, then thunder, yet anon
He Would bring to calm souls an A^odynon.
Scarce second to an Angel was (...) Tongue.
^ wonder how he tarried here so long,
When fitted for the Angels company;
That high, that holy, heavenly Hierarchy
That he was not housed before but left to slay
Till ominous ^ins did fright this Saint away.
Well may the earth grow waste when heaven grows full
The world may well grow bad when God does c^ll
(...) sift the good from bad. Lord bare
(...), and fetch not till we can such spare.
What we thou take, don^t take our spi^i^ual bread,
^^om which our eyes have light, our souls are fed.
We Have lost a Guide midst sinf^l sullen times,
Which are uneven, and won stand in Rhymes;
^ho in home (...) kept (...)
which steady s^ood; nere (...), nere fell nor (...).
^armless (...) demean^d without Offen^^.
(...), yet great Innocence.
(...) Raptures, ^^stasies
(...) him transport unto the azure ^kies.
^ heard good Authors say that then were (...)
(...) ^ngels might come down and cro^d to (...)
(...) Worthies leave us to our Overthrow,
^hese are bad Symptoms of a future Blow.
^^^orable (...) and Heavens (...)
(...) out our ^^ghts, Pillars, P^sts, Tropps out ^own.
(...) happy H^p* Hope hopeful, Help, Joy, (...)
Death's fatal blow (in him) at once cut down.
What to the COTTONs Stock N-England owes
^arth cannot tell: in Heaven we shall know
^hen souls come the^e. The mean while I may say,
We may talk of our debts, though we cannot pay.
^ho^ earth has Coffined up most of the studs,
(...) be the Heavens we have yet some buds
(...) the same Stock Heavens waters make them shoot
(...) the world they came of COTTONs Root.
(...) save our souls, Thy Frowns, our Fears remove.
(...) away Wrath and Rods, and give us Love.
