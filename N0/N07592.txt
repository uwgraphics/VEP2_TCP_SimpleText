THE HEIDELBERGH CATECHISM, OR METHOD OF INSTRUCTION, IN THE Christian
Religion, etc.
I. LORD'S DAY.
FIRST QUESTION.

WHAT is thy only Comfort in Life and Death?

Answer. That I with Cor. 6, 19 20.
Body and Soul, both in Life and Death Romans 14.7.8.9.
am not my own, but belong 1 Cor. 3.23.
unto my faithful Savior Jesus Christ, who with his precious 1 Pet. 1, 18.19.
Blood has fully 1 John 1, 7.
satisfied for all my Sins, and delivered 1 John 3.8. Heb. 2, 14.15.
me from all the Power of the Devil; and so preserves me, that without the Will
of my heavenly Father, not a Hair Luke 21, ^8. Matt. 10, 30.
can fall from my Head; yea that all Things must be Romans ^, 28.
subservient to my Salvation. And therefore, by his Holy Spirit, He also
assures me 2 Cor. 1, 22. and 5.5.
of eternal Life, and makes Romans 8, 14. and 7, 22.
me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to live unto him. John 6, 39.10,
28.29.


Quest. 10. Will God suffer such Disobedience and Rebellion to go unpunished?

Ans. By no Means: Ps. 5, 5.
But is terribly displeased Romans 1, 18. Dut. 28, 15. Heb. 9, 27.
with our original as well as actual Sins; and will punish them in his just
Judgment temporally and eternally, as he has declared, Dut. 27.26. Gal. 3, 10.
Cursed is every one that contiueth not in all Things, which are written in the
Book of the Law, to do them.

Quest. 11. Is not God then also merciful?

Ans. God is indeed merciful, Ex. 34.6.
but also, just; Ex 20, 5. Job 34, 10.11.
therefore his Justice requires, Psalm 5, 5.
that Sin which is committed against the most high Majesty of God, be also
punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting Genesis 2, 17. Romans 6, 23.
Punishments, both of Body and Soul.

THE SECOND PART. Of Man's Deliverance. V. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 12th. Since then, by the righteous Judgment of God, we deserve temporal
and eternal Punishment, is there no Way by which we may escape that Punishment,
and be again received into Favor?

Ans. God will have his Justice Ex. 20, 5.
. satisfied; and therefore we must make this full Romans 8, 3.^ Cor. 5, 14.15.
Satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another.

Quest. 13th. Can we ourselves then make this Satisfaction?

Ans. By no Means; Job 9, 2.3. and 15.14, 15.16.
but on the Contrary we Mat. 6, 12. Isa. 64, 6.
daily increase our Debt.

Quest. 14th. Can there then be found any where, one who is a mere Creature,
able to satisfy for us?

Ans. None; for first, God will not Hebrews 2, 14.18.
punish any other Creature for the Sin which Man has committed; and further no
mere Creature can sustain the Burden of God's eternal Wrath against Sin, so as
to Psalm 130, 3. and 49.8.9.
deliver others from it.

Quest. 15th. What Sort of a Mediator and Deliverer then must we seek for?

Ans. For one who is very Man, 1 Cor. 15, 21. Romans 8, 3.
and perfectly righteous; and yet more powerful than all Creatures; that is,
one who is also very Romans 9, 5. Isa. 7, 14.
God.

VI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 16th. Why must he be very Man, and also perfectly righteous?

Ans. Because the Justice of God, requires that the same human Nature, which
has sinned, should Romans 5.12, 15.
likewise make Satisfaction for Sin; and one who is himself a Sinner 1 Peter 3,
18. Isa. 53, 11.
cannot satisfy for others.

Quest. 17th. Why must He in one Person be also very God?

Ans. That He might, by the Power of his Godhead, 1 Peter 3, 18. Act 2, 24.
Isa. 53.8.
sustain in his human Nature, the Burden of God's Wrath; and might 1 John 1,
2. Je^. 23, 6. 2 Timothy 1. 10. John 6, 51.
obtain for, and restore to us, Righteousness and Life.

Quest. 18th. Who then is that Mediator, who is in one Person both very God,
and a real righteous Man?

Ans. Our Lord Jesus Christ, Math. 1, 2^. 1 Timothy 3, 16. Luke 2, 1^.
who of God is made 1 Cor. 1, 30.
unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.

Quest. 19th. Whence know thou this?

Ans. From the Holy Gospel, which God himself revealed first in Paradise; Genesis
3, 15.
and afterward published by the Patriarchs Genesis 22, 17.18 and 28.14. Romans
^^. Hebrews 1, 1.
and Prophets, and was pleased to represent it, by the Shadows John 5, 46 Heb.
10, 7 8.
of Sacrifices and the other Ceremonies of the Law; and lastly, has
accomplished it Romans 10, 4. Hebrews 13, 8.
by his only begotten Son.

VII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 20th. Are all Men then, as they perished in Adam, saved by Christ?

Ans. No; only Matthew 1, 21. Isa. 53, 11.
those who are ingrafted into him, John 1, 12.13. Romans 11, 20. Heb. 10, 39.
and receive all his Benefits, by a true Faith.

Quest. 21st. What is true Faith?

Ans. True Faith is not only a certain Knowledge, John 6, 69. John 17, 3. Heb
11.3.6.
whereby I hold for Truth all that God Romans 2, 18.19.20.
has revealed to us in his Word, but also an assured Romans 4.16.20.21. Hebrews
11, 1. Ephesians. 3, 12.
Confidence, which the Holy Romans 1, 16. 1 Cor. 1, 21. Act 16, 14. Mat. 16,
17. John 3, 5.
Ghost works by the Gospel, Romans 10, 14.17.
in my Heart; that not only to others, but to me also, Mat. 9, 2.
Remission of Sin, everlasting Righteousness Romans 5.1.
and Salvation, are freely given by God, Gal. 2, 20.
merely of Grace, only for the Sake of Christ's Merits. Romans 3, 24.25.26.


Quest. 22d. What is then necessary for a Christian to believe?

Ans. All Things John 20, 31. Mat. 28, 19.20.
promised us in the Gospel, which the Articles of our Catholic undoubted
Christian Faith briefly teach us.

Quest. What are these Articles!

Answ. I. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth. II.
And in Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, our Lord: III. Who was conceived by
the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary: IV. Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was
crucified, dead and buried. He descended into Hell: V. The Third Day he rose
again from the Dead: VI. He ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right Hand
of God the Father Almighty: VII. From thence he shall come to judge the Quick
and the Dead. VIII. I believe in the Holy Ghost. IX. I believe an Holy
Catholic Church: The Communion of Saints: X. The Forgiveness of Sins: XI. The
Resurrection of the Body: XII. And the Life everlasting. Amen.


VIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 24th. How are these Articles divided?

Ans. Into three Parts; the first is of God the Father, and our Creation;
Geneses 1.
the second of God the Son, and our Redemption; 1 Peter 1, 1^.19.
the third of God the Holy Ghost, and our Sanctification. 1 Peter 1, 21, ^2.


Quest. 25th. Since there is only but one Deuteronomy. 6, 4.
Divine Essence, why speak thou of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?

Ans. Because God has so Gen 1.26. Is^. 61.1. John 14.16.17 1 John, (...) John
1, 18.
revealed himself in His Word, that these three distinct Persons are the one
only true and eternal God.

OF GOD THE FATHER. IX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 25d. What believe thou, when thou say, I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER
ALMIGHTY, MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH?

Ans. That the eternal Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ, (Who Genesis 1. and 2.
Psalm 33.6.
of nothing made Heaven and Earth, with all that is in them; Who likewise
upholds and Psalm 115.3. Mat. 109 29. Heb. 1, 3. John 5.17.
governs the same by His eternal Counsel and Providence) is for the Sake of
Christ His Son, my Job. 1, 12. Romans 8, 15.16. Galat. 4, 5.6. Ephesians. 1.5. 1 John
3, 1.
God, and my Father; on whom I rely so entirely, that I have no Doubt, but He
will provide me with all Things necessary Psalm 55.22. Mat. 6 26.
for Soul and Body: And further, that He will make whatever Evils He sends upon
me, in this Valley of Tears, Romans 8, 28.
turn out to my Advantage; for He is able to do it, being Almighty Romans 10, 12.
God; and willing, being a Matt. 6, 26. and 7, 9.10.11.
faithful Father.

X. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 27th. What do thou mean by the Providence of God?

Ans. The Almighty and every where present Power of God; Act 17, 25.26.27 28.
whereby, as it were by His Hand Heb^^w^ 1, 3.
He upholds and governs Heaven, Earth, and all Creatures; so that Herbs and
Grass, Rain Jer. 5.24.
and Drought, fruitful Act. 14, 17.
and barren Years, Meat and Drink, John 9.3.
Health and Sickness, Prove. 22.2. Job. 1, 21.
Riches and Poverty, yea all Things Mat. 10, 29.30. Ephesians. 1, 11.
come, not by Chance, but by His fatherly Hand.

Quest. 28. What Advantage is it to us to know that God has created, and by his
Providence does still uphold all Things?

Ans. That we may be patient in Adversity, Romans 5.3. Psalm 39, 10.
thankful Deuteronomy. 8.10. 1 These. 5, 18.
in Prosperity; and that in all Things, which may hereafter befall us, we place
our firm Romans 5, 4.5.6.
Trust in our faithful God and Father, that nothing shall Romans 8, 38.39.
separate us from His Love, since all Creatures are so in His Hand, that
without His Will they Job 1, 12. and 2, 6. Matt. 8, 31. Isa. 10, 15.
cannot so much as move.

OF GOD THE SON. XI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 29th. Why is the Son of God called Jesus, that is a Savior?

Ans. Because He saves us, and delivers us from our Matt. 1, 21.
Sins; and likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find, Act 4, 12.
Salvation in any other.

Quest. 30. Do such then believe in Jesus the only Savior, who seek their
Salvation and Happiness of Saints, of themselves, or any where else?

Ans. They do not; for though they boast of Him in Words, yet in Deeds they deny
1 Cor, 1, 13.31. Gal. 5, 4.
Jesus the only Deliverer and Savior; for one of these two Things must be
true, that either Jesus is not a complete Savior; or that they who by a true
Faith receive this Savior, must find all Things in Him Heb. 12.2. Isa. 9.6.7.
Col. 1, 19.20.
necessary to their Salvation.

XII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 31st. Why is He called Christ, that is anointed?

Ans. Because He is ordained of God the Father, and Heb. 1, 9.
anointed with the Holy Ghost, to be our Deuteronomy. 18, 18. Acts 3, 22. John 1, 18.
and 15, 15. Matt. 11, 27.
chief Prophet and Teacher; Who has fully revealed to us the secret Council and
Will of God concerning our Redemption: And to be our only High Priest, Psa.
110, 4. Heb. 7, 21. and 10, 14.
Who by the one Sacrifice of His Body, has redeemed us, and makes continual
Romans 8, 34.
Intercession with the Father for us; and also to be our eternal Psalm 2, 6.
Luke 1, 33.
King, Who governs us by His Word and Spirit; and Who defends and Matt. 28, 18.
John 10, 28.
preserves us in [the Enjoyment of] that Salvation He has purchased for us.

Quest. 32. But why art thou called a Christian?

Ans. Because I am a Member of Christ 1 Cor. 6, 15.
by Faith, and thus am Partaker 1 John 2.27. Joel 2, 28.
of His anointing, that so I may Matt. 10, 32.
confess His Name, and present myself a living Romans 12.1. Apo. 1, 6.
Sacrifice of Thankfulness to Him: and also that with a free and good
Conscience I may fight against Sin and Ephesians. 6, 11.12. 1 Timothy, 1, 18.19.
Satan in this Life; and afterward 2 Timothy 2, 12.
reign with Him eternally, over all Creatures.

XIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 33. Why is Christ called the only begotten Son of God, since we are
also the Children of God?

Ans. Because Christ alone is the eternal and natural Son of John 1, 1. Heb. 1,
2.
God; but we are Children Romans 8, 15.16.17. Ephesians. 1, 5.6.
adopted of God, by Grace, for His Sake.

Quest. 34th. Wherefore call thou Him our Lord?

Ans. Because He has redeemed us, both Soul and Body, from all our Sins, not
with Gold or Silver 1 Pet. 1, 18.19.1 Cor. 6, 20.
but with His precious Blood, and has delivered us from all the Power of the
Devil; and thus has made us His own Property.

XIV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 35th. What is the Meaning of these Words, HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE HOLY
GHOST, BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY?

Ans. That God's eternal Son, who John 1, 1. Col 1, 15. Psa. 2.7.
is, and continues true and eternal Romans 9.5. 1 John 5, 20.
God, John 1, 14. Gal. 4.4.
took upon Him the very Nature of Man, of the Flesh and Mat. 1, 18. Luke 1.35.
Blood of the Virgin Mary, by the Operation of the Holy Ghost; Psalm 132, 11.
Acts 2, 30. Romans 1, 3.
That He might also, be the true Seed of David, Phil. 2, 7.
like unto his Brethren in all Things, Heb. 4, 15.
Sin excepted.

Quest. 36th. What Profit do thou receive by Christ's holy Conception and
Nativity?

Ans. That He is our Heb. 2, 16, 17.
Mediator; and with his Innocence and perfect Holiness, covers in the Sight of
Psalm 32, 1. 1 Cor. 1, 30. Romans 8, 34.
God, my Sins, wherein I was conceived and brought forth!

XV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 37th. What do thou understand by the Word, "HE SUFFERED?"

Ans. That He, all the Time He lived on Earth, but especially at the End of his
Life, 1 Pet. 2, 24. Isa. 53, 12.
sustained in Body and Soul, the Wrath of God against the Sins of all Mankind.
That so by His Passion, as the only 1 John 2, 2. Romans 3, 25.
propitiatory Sacrifice, He might redeem our Body and Soul from everlasting
Damnation, and obtain for us the Favor of God, Righteousness and eternal Life.

Question 38th. Why did He suffer under Pontius Pilate, as His Judge?

Ans. That He, being innocent, and yet condemned Luke 23, 14. John 19, 4. Psalm
69, 5.
by a temporal Judge, might thereby free us from the severe Judgment of God, to
which we were exposed. Gal. 3, 13.


Quest. 39th. Is there Anything more in His being crucified, than if He had
died some other Death?

Ans. Yes [there is]; for thereby I am assured, that he took on Him the Curse
which lay upon me; for the Death of the Cross was Deuteronomy. 21, 23. Gal. 3, 13.
accursed of God.

XVI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 40th. Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even to Death?

Ans. Because, with respect to the Justice and Truth of God, Satisfaction for
our Sins could be made Genesis 2, 17.
no otherwise than by the Death of the Heb. 2, 9.10. Phil. 2, 8.
Son of God.

Quest. 41. Why was He also "BURIED?"

Ans. Thereby to prove that He Acts 13, 29. John 19, 38. etc.
was really dead.

Quest. 42. Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?

Ans. Our Death is not a Satisfaction for our Sins, but only an abolishing of
Sin, and a Passage into John 5, 24. Phil. 1, 23.
eternal Life.

Quest. 43. What further Benefit do we receive from the Sacrifice and Death of
Christ on the Cross?

Ans. That by Virtue thereof, our Old Man is crucified, dead, and Romans 6, 6.7.
etc.
buried with Him; that so the corrupt Inclinations of the Flesh may no more
Romans 6, 12.
reign in us; but that we may Romans 12, 1.
offer ourselves unto Him a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving.

Quest. 44th. Why is there added HE DESCENDED INTO HELL?

Ans. That in my greatest Temptations, I may be assured, and wholly comfort
myself in this, that my Lord Jesus Christ by His inexpressible Anguish, Pains,
Terrors, and hellish Agonies, in which He was plunged during all His
Sufferings, but especially on the Cross, has Isa. 53.10. Matt. 27, 46.
delivered me from the Anguish and Torments of Hell.

XVII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 45th. What does the Resurrection of Christ profit us?

Ans. First; by His Resurrection He has overcome Death, that He might 1 Cor.
15, 16.
make us Partakers of that Righteousness which He had purchased for us by His
Death. Secondly, we are also by His Power, Romans 6, 4. Col. 3, 1. etc.
raised up to a new Life. And lastly, the Resurrection of Christ is a 1 Cor.
15. Romans 8, 11.
sure Pledge of our blessed Resurrection.

XVIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 46th. How do thou understand these Words, HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN?

Ans. That Christ, in Sight of His Disciples was Acts 1, 9. Mark 16, 19.
taken up from Earth into Heaven; and that He continues Heb. 4.14. Romans 8, 34.
Ephesians. 4, 10.
there for our Interest, until He come again to judge the Quick and the Dead.

Quest. 47th. Is not Christ then with us even to the End of the World, as He
has promised?

Ans. Christ is very Man and very God: With Respect to his Acts 3, 21. John 3,
13. John 16, 28.
human Nature, He is no more on Earth; but with Respect to His Matt. 28, 20.
Godhead, Majesty, Grace and Spirit, He is at no Time absent from us.

Quest. 48th. But if his human Nature is not present, wherever His Godhead
is, are not then these two Natures in Christ separated from one another?

Answ. Not at all, for since the Godhead is incomprehensible and Acts 7, 49.
Mat. 24, 30.
omnipresent; it must necessarily follow that Mat. 28, 20. John 16, 28 and 17,
11. John 3, 13.
the same is not limited with the human Nature He assumed, and yet remains
personally united to it.

Quest. 49th. Of what Advantage to us is Christ's Ascension into Heaven?

Answ. First, That He is our Heb. 9, 24. 1 John 2, 2. Romans 8, 34.
Advocate in the Presence of His Father in Heaven: Secondly, That we have our
Flesh in Heaven as a sure Pledge, that He as the Head, will also John 14, 2.
Ephesians 2, 6.
take up to himself, us his Members. Thirdly, That He John 14 16. 2 Cor. 1, 22.
2 Cor. 5, 5.
sends us His Spirit as an Earnest, by whose Power we seek the Things which are
above, where Christ sits on the right Hand of God, Colossians 3, 1.
Philippians 3, 20.
and not Things on Earth.

XIX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 50th. Why is it added, AND SITS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD?

Ans. Because Christ is ascended into Heaven for this End, That He might there
Ephesians 1, 20. Colossians 1, 18.
appear as head of His Church, by whom the Father Matthew 28, 18. John 5, 22.
governs all Things.

Quest. 51st. What Profit is this Glory of Christ our Head unto us?

Answ. First, that by His holy Spirit He Ephesians 4, 10.
pours out heavenly Graces upon us his Members: And then that by His Power He
defends Psalms 2, 9. John 10, 28.
and preserves us against all Enemies.

Quest. 52d. What Comfort is it to thee that CHRIST SHALL COME AGAIN TO JUDGE
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD?

Ans. That in all my Sorrows and Persecutions, with uplifted Head Luke 21, 28.
Romans 8, 23.24. 1 These. 4, 16.
I look for the very same Person, who before offered Himself for my Sake, to
the Tribunal of God, and has removed all Curse from me, to come as Judge from
Heaven; who shall cast all his 2 These. 1, 6.7. Matthew 25, 41.
and my Enemies into everlasting Condemnation, but shall translate Matthew 25,
34.
me with all his Chosen-ones to Himself, into heavenly Joys and Glory.

OF GOD THE HOLY GHOST. XX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 53d. What do thou believe concerning the Holy Ghost?

Ans. First, That He is true and coeternal God with the Father and the Geneses
1, 2. Isaiah 48, 16. 1 Cor. 3, 16.
Son: Secondly, that He is also given Matthew 28, 19. 2 Cor. 1, 21.
me, to Galatians 3, 14. 1 Peter 1, 2.
make me by a true Faith, Partaker of Christ and all his Benefits, that He may
Acts 9, 31.
comfort me, and John 14, 16. 1 Peter 4, 14.
abide with me forever.

XXI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 54th. What believe thou concerning the "HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" of
Christ?

Ans. That the Son of God John 10, 11.
from the Geneses 26, 4.
Beginning to the End of the World, gathers, Romans 8, 29. Ephesians 1, 10.
defends, and Matthew 16, 18.
preserves to himself by his Isaiah 59, 21.
Spirit and Word, out of the Deuteronomy. 10, 14.15.
whole human Race, a Acts 13, 48.
Church chosen to everlasting Life, agreeing in true Faith; and that I am, and
forever shall remain, a 1 Cor. 1, 8.9. Romans 8, 35, etc.
living Member thereof.

Quest. 55th. What do you understand by "THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS?"

Ans. First, that all and every one who believes, being Members of Christ, are
in common 1 John 1, 3. Romans 8, 32. 1 Corin. 12, 13.
Partakers of Him, and of all his Riches and Gifts: Secondly, that every one
must know it to be his Duty, readily and 1 Corin. 13, 5. Philippians 2, 4.5.6.
cheerfully to employ his Gifts, for the Advantage and Salvation of other
Members.

Quest. 56th. What believe thou concerning "THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS?"

Ans. That God for the Sake of 1 John 2, 2. 2 Cor. 5, 19 21.
Christ's Satisfaction, will no more Jeremiah 31, 34. Psalms 103, 3.4.10.11.
Romans 8, 1.2.3.
remember my Sins, neither my corrupt Nature, against which I have to struggle
all my Life long; but will graciously impute to me the Righteousness of Christ,
that I may never be John 3, 18.
condemned before the Tribunal of God.

XXII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 57th. What Comfort does the Resurrection of the Body afford thee?

Ans. That not only my Soul after this Life, shall be immediately taken Luke
23, 43. Philippians 1, 23.
up to Christ its Head; but also, that this my Body, being raised by the Power
of Christ, shall be reunited with my Soul, and 1 Corinthi. 15 53. Job 19, 25.26.
made like unto the glorious Body of Christ.

Quest. 58th. What Comfort take thou from the Article of Life everlasting?

Ans. That since 2 Cor. 5, 2.3.6. Romans 14, 17.
I now feel in my Heart the Beginning of eternal Joy, after this Life, Psalms
16, 11.
(...) shall inherit perfect Salvation, which 1 Corinthians 2, 9.
Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, neither has it entered into the Heart of
Man to conceive, and that, to praise God therein forever.

XXIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 59th. But what does it profit thee now that thou believe all this?

Ans. That I am righteous (...) Christ before God, and an heir of eternal Life.
Romans 5, 1. Romans 1, 17. John 3, 36.


Quest. 60th. How art thou righteous before God?

Ans. Only Romans 3, 22, etc. Galatians 2, 16. Ephesians 2, 8.9.
by a true Faith in Jesus Christ; so that, though my Conscience accuse me, that I
have grossly transgressed all the Commands of God, and Romans 3, 9, etc.
kept none of them, and am, still Romans 7, 23.
inclined to all Evil; notwithstanding, God, without any Romans 3, 24.
Merit of mine, but only of mere Titus 3, 5. Ephesians 2, 8.9.
Grace, grants Romans 4, 4 5. 2 Corinthi. 5, 19.
and 1 John 2, 1.
imputes to me, the perfect 1 John 2, 2.
Satisfaction, Righteousness and Holiness of Christ; even so, as if I never had
had, nor committed any Sin: Yea, as if I had fully 2 Cor. 5, 21.
accomplished all that Obedience which Christ has accomplished for me; Romans
3, 28. John 3, 18.
in as much as I embrace such Benefit with a believing Heart.

Quest. 61st. Why say thou, that thou art righteous by Faith only?

Ans. Not that I am acceptable to God, on Account of the Psalms 16, 2.
Ephesians 2, 8.9.
Worthiness of my Faith; but because only the Satisfaction, Righteousness, and
Holiness of Christ, is my Righteousness before 1 Corinthi. 1, 30. 1 Corin. 2, 2.
God, and that I cannot receive 1 John 5, 10.
and apply the same to myself any other Way than by Faith only.

XXIV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 62d. But why cannot our good Works be the Whole or Part of our
Righteousness before God?

Ans. Because, that the Righteousness, which can be approved of before the
Tribunal of God, must be absolutely perfect, and in all Respects Galat. 3, 10.
Deutero. 27, 26.
conformable to the divine Law: and also, that our best Works in this Life, are
all imperfect and Isaiah 46, 6.
defiled with Sin.

Quest. 63d. What! do not our good Works merit, which yet God will reward in
this and in a future Life?

Ans. This Reward is not of Merit, but of Luke 17, 10.
Grace.

Quest. 64th. But does not this Doctrine make Men careless and profane?

Ans. By no Means: For it is impossible that those who are implanted into
Christ by a true Faith, should not bring forth Fruits of Matthew 7, 18. John
15, 5.
Thankfulness.

OF THE SACRAMENTS. XXV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 65th. Since then we are made Partakers of Christ and all his Benefits
by Faith only, whence does this Faith proceed?

Ans. From the Holy Ghost, who works Ephesians 2, 8, and 6.23. Philippians 1,
29.
Faith in our Hearts by the preaching of the Gospel, and Matthew 28, 19. Romans
4, 11.
confirms it by the Use of the Sacraments.

Quest. 66th. What are the Sacraments?

Ans. The Sacraments are holy visible Signs and Seals appointed of God for this
End, that by the Use thereof, He may the more fully declare and seal to us the
Promise of the Gospel; viz. That He grants us freely the Remission of Sin and
Geneses 17, 11. Romans 4, 11. Deuter. 30, 6. Leviticus 6, 25. Acts 22, 16. Acts
2, 38. Matthew 26, 28.
Life eternal, for the Sake of that one Sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the
Cross.

Quest. 67th. Are both Word and Sacraments then ordained and appointed for this
End, that they may direct our Faith to the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the
Cross, as the only Ground of our Salvation?

Ans. Yes indeed; for the Holy Ghost teaches us in the Gospel, and assures us
by the Sacraments, Romans 6, 3. Galatians 3, 27.
that the whole of our Salvation depends upon that one Sacrifice of Christ,
which He offered for us on the Cross.

Quest. 68th. How many Sacraments has Christ instituted in the New Covenant, or
Testament?

Ans. 1 Cor. 10, 2.3.4.
Two, namely Holy Baptism, and the Holy Supper.

OF HOLY BAPTISM. XXVI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 69th. How art thou admonished and assured by Holy Baptism, that the one
Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross is of real Advantage to thee?

Ans. Thus, that Christ appointed Matthew 28, 19. Acts 2, 38.
this external Washing with Water, adding thereto this Mark 16, 16. Matthew 3,
11. Romans 6, 3.
Promise, that I am as certainly washed by His Blood and Spirit from all the
Pollution of my Soul, that is from all my Sins, as I am Mark 1, 4. Luke 3, 3.
washed externally with Water, by which the Filthiness of the Body is commonly
washed away.

Quest. 70th. What is it to be washed with the Blood and Spirit of Christ?

Ans. It is to receive of God the Remission of Sins, freely, for the Sake of
Christ's Blood, which He Hebrews 12, 24. 1 Peter 1, 2. Apo. 1, 5.
shed for us in his Sacrifice upon the Cross: and also to be renewed by the
Holy Ghost, and sanctified to be Members of Christ; that so we may more and
more die unto Sin, and John 1, 33. Romans 6, 4. Col. 2, 12.
lead holy and unblameable Lives.

Quest. 71st. Where has Christ promised us, that He will as certainly wash us
by his Blood and Spirit, as we are washed with the Water of Baptism?

Ans. In the Institution of Baptism, which is thus expressed, Matthew 28, 19.
Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost Mark 16, 16.
:" "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes
not, shall be damned. This Promise is also repeated, where the Scripture calls
Baptism the Titus 3, 5.
Washing of Regeneration, and the Washing Acts 22, 16.
away of Sins.

XXVII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 72d. Is then the external Baptism with Water, the washing away of Sin
itself?

Ans. Not at all; for the Matthew 3, 11. 1 Peter 3, 21.
Blood of Jesus Christ only, and the Holy Ghost, cleanse us from all 1 John 1,
7. 1 Corinthi. 6, 11.
Sin.

Quest. 73d. Why then does the Holy Ghost call Baptism "the Washing of
Regeneration" and "the Washing away of Sins?"

Ans. God speaks thus not without great Cause, to wit, not only thereby to
teach us, that as the Filth of the Body is purged away by Water, so our Sins
are Revelations 1, 5. 1 Corin. 6, 11.
removed by the Blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; but especially, that by this
Divine Pledge and Sign He may assure us, that we are spiritually cleansed from
our Sins as really, as we are externally Mark 16, 16. Galatians 3, 27.
washed with Water.

Quest. 74th. Are Infants also to be baptized?

Ans. Yes, for since they, as well as the Adult, are included in the Geneses
17, 7. Acts 2, 39.
Covenant and 1 Corinthi. 7, 14. Joel 2, 16.
Church of God; and since Matthew 19, 14.
Redemption from Sin by the Blood of Christ, and the Luke 1, 14.15. Psalms 22,
10. Acts 2, 39.
Holy Ghost, the Author of Faith, is promised to them no less than to the
Adult; they must therefore by Baptism, as a Sign of the Covenant, be also
admitted into the Christian Church; and be distinguished Acts 10, 47. 1 Corin.
12, 13. and 7.14.
from the Children of Infidels, as was done in the Old Covenant or Testament by
Geneses 17, 14.
Circumcision, instead of which, Col. 2, 11.12.13.
Baptism is instituted in the New Covenant.

OF THE HOLY SUPPER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. XXVIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 75th. How art thou admonished and assured in the Lord's Supper, that
thou art a Partaker of that one Sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the Cross,
and of all his Benifits?

Ans. Thus, That Christ has commanded me and all Believers, to eat of this
broken Bread, and to Drink of this Cup, in Remembrance of Him, Matt.
26.26.27.28. Mark 14, 22.23.24. Luke 22, 19.20. 1 Cor. 10, 16.17. and 11,
23.24.25.
adding these Promises; First, that His Body was offered and broken on the
Cross for me, and His Blood shed for me, as certainly as I see with my Eyes,
the Bread of the Lord broken for me, and the Cup communicated to me: And
further, that He feeds and nourishes my Soul to everlasting Life, with His
crucified Body, and shed Blood, as assuredly as I receive from the Hands of the
Minister, and taste with my Mouth the Bread and Cup of the Lord, as certain
Signs of the Body and Blood of Christ.

Quest. 76th. What is it then to eat the crucified Body, and drink the shed
Blood of Christ?

Ans. It is not only to embrace with a believing Heart all the Sufferings and
Death of Christ, and thereby to John 6.35.40.47.48.50.51.53 54.
obtain the Pardon of Sin and Life eternal; but also, besides that, to become
more and more John 6, 55.56.
united to His sacred Body by the Holy Ghost who dwells both in Christ and in
us; so that we, though Christ is in Acts 3, 21 and 1.9.10.11. 1 Corin. 11, 26.
Heaven and we on Earth, are notwithstanding Flesh of His Flesh, and Bone of
Ephesians 5.29.30.31.32. 1 Corinthi 6, 15.17.19. 1 John 3, 24.
His Bone; and that we live John 6, 56.57.58. Ephesi. 4, 15.16.
and are governed forever by one Spirit, as Members of the same Body are by one
Soul.

Quest. 77th. Where has Christ promised that He will as certainly feed and
nourish Believers with His Body and Blood, as they eat of this broken Bread,
and drink of this Cup?

Ans. In the Institution of the Supper which is thus expressed; 1 Corinthi.
11.23. Matthew 26, 26. Mark 14, 22. Luke 22, 19.
The Lord Jesus in the same Night in which he was betrayed, took Bread, and
when He had given Thanks, He brake it, and said, take, eat; this is my Body,
which is broken for you; this do in Remembrance of me: After the same Manner
also He took the Cup, when he had supped, saying, this Exodus 24, 8. Hebrews 9
20.
Cup is the New Testament in my Blood: Exodus 13, 9. 1 Corin. 11, 2^.
This do ye as often as ye drink it, in Remembrance of me. For as often as ye
eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do show the Lord's Death till he come.

This Promise is repeated by the Holy Apostle Paul, where he says, 1 Cor. 10,
16.17.
The Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of
Christ? The Bread which we break is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?
For we being many, are one Bread and one Body; because we are all Partakers of
that one Bread.

XXIX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 78th. Do then the Bread and Wine become the very Body and Blood of
Christ.

Ans. Not at all: 1 Corin. 10, 1.2.3.4. 1 Peter 3.21. John 6, 35.62.63.
But as the Water in Baptism is not changed into the Blood of Christ, neither
is the Washing away of Sin itself, being only the Sign and Confirmation thereof
appointed of God; so the Bread in the Lord's Supper is not changed into the
very 1 Cor. 10, 16 etc. and 11.26 etc.
Body of Christ, though agreeable to the Genesea 17, 10.11.14. Exodus
12.26.27.43.48. Acts 7, 8. Matthew 26, 26. Mark 14, 24.
Nature and Properties of Sacraments, it is called the Body of Christ Jesus.

Quest. 79th. Why then does Christ call the Bread his Body, and the Cup his
Blood, or the New Covenant in his Blood, and Paul the Communion of the Body and
Blood of Christ.

Ans. Christ speaks thus not without great reason, namely, not only thereby to
teach us, that as Bread and Wine support this temporal Life, so his crucified
Body, and shed Blood are the true Meat and Drink whereby our Souls are John 6,
51.55.56.
fed to eternal Life; but more especially by these visible Signs and Pledges to
assure us, that we are as really Partakers of his true Body and Blood (by the
Operation of the Holy Ghost) as we 1 Corin. 10, 16.17. and 11.26.27.28.
Ephestans 5, 32.
receive by the Mouths of our Bodies these Holy Signs in Remembrance of Him;
and that all his Sufferings Romans 5, 9.18.19. and 8.4.
and Obedience, are as certainly ours, as if we had in our own Persons suffered
and made Satisfaction for our Sins to God.

XXX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 80th. What Difference is there between the Lord's Supper and the Popish
Mass?

Ans. The Lord's Supper testifies to us, that we have a full Pardon of all Sin
Heb. 7, 27. and 9.12.26. Matthew 26, 28. Luke 22, 19.20. 2 Corinthi 5, 21.
by the only Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which He himself has once accomplished
on the Cross; and, that we by the Holy Ghost are ingrafted 1 Cor. 6, 17. and
12.13.
into Christ, who, according to his human Nature is now not on Earth, but in
Heb. 1, 3. and 8.1. etc.
Heaven, at the Right Hand of God his Father, and will there John 4, 21.22.23.
Colossians 3, 1. Philippians 3, 20. Luke 24, 52.53. Acts 7, 55.
be worshipped by us: But the Mass teaches that the Living and Dead have not
the Pardon of Sins through the Sufferings of Christ, unless Christ is also
daily offered for them by the Priests; and further, that Christ is bodily under
the Form of Bread and Wine, and therefore is to be In canone Missae and de
consecra distinct. 2. Council. Trid. Sess. 13.15.
worshipped in them; so that the Mass at Bottom, is nothing else than a Isaiah
1, 11.14. Matthew 15, 9. Col. 2, 22.23. Jeremiah 2, 13.
Denial of the one Sacrifice and Sufferings of Jesus Christ, and an accursed
Idolatry.

Quest. 81st. For whom is the Lord's Supper instituted?

Ans. For those who are truly sorrowful Matthew 5, 3.6. Luke 7, 37.38. and
15.18.19.
for their Sins, and yet trust that these are forgiven them for the Sake of
Christ; and that their remaining Infirmities Psalm 103, 3.
are covered by his Passion and Death; and who also earnestly Psalm 116,
12.13.14. 1 Peter 2, 11.12.
desire to have their Faith more and more strengthened, and their Lives more
holy; but Hypocrites, and such as turn not to God with sincere Hearts, eat and
1 Cor. 10, 20, etc. and 11.28. etc. Titus 1, 16. Psalm 50, 15.16.
drink Judgment to themselves.

Quest. 82d. Are they also to be admitted to this Supper, who by Confession and
Life declare themselves Infidels and Ungodly?

Ans. No; for by this, the Covenant of God would be profaned, and His Wrath 1
Cor. 10, 21 and 11.30.31. Isaiah 1.11.13. Jeremiah 7, 21. Psalm 50, 16.22.
kindled against the whole Congregation; therefore it is the Duty of the
Christian Church, according to the Appointment of Mat. 18, 17.18.
Christ and his Apostles, to exclude such Persons by the Keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven, till they show Amendment of Life.

XXXI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 83d. What are Matthew 16, 19.
the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven?

Ans. The Preaching John 20, 23.
of the Holy Gospel, and Christian Discipline, Mat. 18, 15.18.
or Excommunication out of the Christian Church; by these two, the Kingdom of
Heaven is opened to Believers, and shut against Unbelievers.

Quest. 84th. How is the Kingdom of Heaven opened and shut by the Preaching of
the Holy Gospel?

Ans. Thus; when according to the Command of Matthew 28, 19.
Christ, it is declared and publicly testified to all and every Believer, that
whenever they John 3, 13.36. Mark 16.16.
receive the Promise of the Gospel by a true Faith, all their Sins are really
forgiven them of God, for the Sake of Christ's Merits; and on the Contrary,
when it is declared and testified to all Unbelievers, and such as do not
sincerely repent, that they stand exposed to the Wrath of God, and eternal 2
These. 1, 7.8.9.
Condemnation, so long as they are John 20, 21.22.23. Matthew 16, 19. Romans 2,
2.17.
unconverted: According to which Testimony of the Gospel, God will judge them,
both in this, and the Life to come.

Quest. 85th. How is the Kingdom of Heaven shut and opened by Christian
Discipline?

Ans. Thus; when according Matthew 18, 15.
to the Command of Christ, those who under the Name of Christians maintain
Doctrines, or Practices 1 Corinthi. 5, 12.
inconsistent therewith; will not, after having been often brotherly
admonished, renounce their Errors and wicked Course of Life, are complained of
to the Church, Mat. 18, 15.18.
or to those who are thereunto Romans 12, 7.8.9. 1 Corin. 12, 28. 1 Timothy 5, 17.
appointed by the Church; and, if they despise their Admonition, 2 Thessalonians. 3,
14. Matthew 18, 17. 1 Cor. 5.3.4.5.
are by them forbid the Use of the Sacraments, whereby they are excluded from
the Christian Church, and by God himself from the Kingdom of Christ; and when
they promise and show real Amendment, are again 2 Cor. 2, 6.7.8.10.11. Luke 15,
18.
received as Members of Christ and His Church.

THE THIRD PART. OF THANKFULNESS. XXXII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 86th. Since then we are delivered from our Misery, merely of Grace,
through Christ, without any Merit of ours; why must we still do good Works?

Answ. Because that Christ, having redeemed and delivered us by his Blood, also
renews us by His Holy Spirit, after his own Image; that so we may testify by
the whole of our Conduct, our Gratitude 1 Cor. 6, 19.20. Romans 6, 13 and
12.1.2. 1 Pet. 2, 5.9.10.
to God for his Blessings, and that He may be Matthew 5, 16. 1 Peter 2, 12.
praised by us: Also, that every one may be 2 Peter 1, 10. Galati. 5, 6.24.
assured in himself of his Faith, by the Fruits thereof; and that by our Godly
Conversation others may be 1 Peter 3, 1.2. Matthew 5, 16. Romans 14, 19.
gained to Christ.

Quest. 87th. Cannot they then be saved, who continuing in their wicked and
ungrateful lives, are not converted to God?

Ans. By no Means; for the Holy Scripture declares 1 Corin. 6, 9.10. Ephesians
5, 5. 1 John 3.14.15. Galatians 5.21.
that no unchaste Person, Idolater, Adulterer, Thief, covetous Man, Drunkard,
Slanderer, Robber, or any such like, shall inherit the Kingdom of God.

XXXIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 88th. In how many Parts does the true Conversion of Man consist?

Ans. In two Parts; in Romans 6, 4.5.6. Ephesians. 4, 22.23. Colossians 3.5. 1
Corinthians 5, 7.
the Mortification of the Old, and in the Quickening of the New Man.

Quest. 89th. What is the Mortification of the Old Man?

Ans. It is a Psalm 51, 3.8.17. Luke 15, 18. Romans 8, 13. Joel 1, 12.13.
sincere Sorrow of Heart, that we have provoked God by our Sins, and more and
more to hate and flee from them.

Quest. 90th. What is the Quickening of the New Man?

Ans. It is a sincere Joy of Heart in God, through Christ, Romans 5, 1.2. and
14.17. Isaiah 57, 15.
and with Love and Romans 6, 10.11. 1 Peter 4.2. Galatians 2, 20.
Delight to live according to the Will of God in all good Works.

Quest. 91st. But what are good Works?

Ans. Only those which proceed from a true Romans 14, 23.
Faith, are performed according to the 1 Samuel 15, 22. Ephesians 2, 10.
Law of God, and to His 1 Corin. 10, 31.
Glory; and not such as are Deuterono. 12, 32. Ezekiel 20, 18. Matthew 15, 9.
founded on our Imaginations, or the Institutions of Men.

XXXIV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 29th. What is the Law of God?

Ans. God spoke all these Words, Exodus xx. Deuteronomy. v. saying, I am the Lord thy
God, which has brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of
Bondage.

I. COM. Thou shall have no other Gods before me. II. COM. Thou shall not make
unto thyself any graven Image, nor the Likeness of any Thing that is in Heaven
above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Water under the Earth. Thou shall not
bow down to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
visiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and
fourth Generation of them that hate me, and showing Mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my Commandments. III. COM. Thou shall not take the
Name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless,
that takes his Name in vain. IV. COM. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it
holy, six Days shall thou labor, and do all thy Work, but the seventh Day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: In it thou shall do no Manner of Work, thou
nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man Servant, nor thy Maid Servant, nor thy
Cattle, nor the Stranger that is within thy Gates. For in Six Days the Lord
made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
Day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath Day, and hallowed it. V. COM.
Honor thy Father and thy Mother, that thy Days may be long in the Land, which
the Lord thy God gives thee. VI. COM. Thou shall not kill. VII. COM. Thou
shall not commit Adultery. VIII. COM. Thou shall not steal. IX. COM. Thou shall
not bear false Witness against thy Neighbor. X. COM. Thou shall not covet thy
Neighbor's House, thou shall not covet thy Neighbor's Wife, nor his Servant,
nor his Maid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is thy Neighbor's.
Quest. 93. How are these ten Commands divided?

Ans. Into two Exodus 34, 28.29. Deu. 4, 13 and 10.3.4.
Tables, the Matthew 22, 37.38.39.
first of which teaches us how we must behave toward God; the second, what
Duties we owe to our Neighbor.

Quest. 94. What does God enjoin in the first Command?

Answ. That I, as sincerely as I desire the Salvation of my own Soul, avoid and
flee from all Idolatry, 1 Cor. 6, 9.10. and 10.7.14.
Sorcery, Leviticus 18, 21. Deuterono. 18, 10.11.12.
Soothsaying, Superstition, Matthew 4, 10. Revelati. 10.10.
Invocation of Saints, or any other Creatures, and learn John 17, 3. sere. 17,
5.7. Heb. 10, 36. Col. 1, 11. Romans 5.3.4. Phi. 2, 14.
rightly to know the only true God: s trust in him alone; with Humility t and
Patience 1 Peter 5.5.6.
submit to Him, Psa. 104, 27. Isa. 45.7. James 1, 17.
expect all good Things from Him only; Deuterono. 6, 5. Matthew 22, 37.
love, Deuteronomay 6, 2, Matthew 10, 28.
fear, and Matthew 4, 10.
glority Him with my whole Heart: So that I renounce Mat. 5, 29.30. Acts 5, 29.
Mat. Mat. 10, 37.
and forsake all Creatures, rather than Matthew 5, 19.
commit even the least Thing, contrary to his Will.

Quest. 95. What is Idolatry?

Ans. Idolatry is instead of, or besides that one true God, who has manifested
Himself in His Word, to contrive, or have any other Object in which Men place
their Trust. 2 Chronicles. 16, 12. Phil. 3.19. Gal. 4, 8. Ephesians. 2, 12.


XXXV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 96. What does God require in the second Command?

Ans. That we in no Wise Deuterono. 4, 15. Isa. 40, 18. Romans 1, 23. etc. Acts
17, 29.
represent God by Images, nor worship 1 Samuel 15, 23. Deuteronomy. 12, 30.
Him in any other Way than He has commanded in his Word.

Quest. 97. Are Images then not at all to be made?

Answ. God neither can, nor Deuteronomy. 4, 15.16. Isa. 46, 5. Romans 1, 23.
may be represented by any Means: But as to Creatures, though they may be
represented, yet God forbids to make, or have any Resemblance of them, either
in Order to worship them, Exo. 23, 24, and 34.13.14. Numbers 33, 52.
Deuteronomy 7, 5.
or to serve God by them.

Quest. 98. But may not Images be tolerated in the Churches, as Books to the
Laity?

Ans. No; for we must not pretend to be wiser than God, who will have his
People 2 Timothy 3, 16.2 Peter 1, 19.
taught, not by dumb Images, Jeremi, 10, 1. etc. Hab. 2, 18.19.
but by the lively preaching of his Word.

XXXVI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 99. What is required in the third Command?

Ans. That we, not only by cursing or Lev. 24, 11. and 19.12.
Perjury; but also by Matthew 5, 37. Leviticus 5.4.
rash swearing, must not profane or abuse the Name of God; nor by Silence or
Connivance be Partakers of these horrible Sins in others; and briefly, that we
use the holy Name of Isa. 45, 23, 24.
God no otherwise than with Fear and Reverence; so that He may be rightly
Matthew 10, 32.
confessed and 1 Timothy 2, 8.
worshipped by us, and be glorified in all our Colo. 3, 16.17.
Words and Works.

Quest. 100. Is then the profaning of God's Name by swearing and cursing, so
heinous a Sin, that His Wrath is kindled against those who do not endeavor as
much as in them lies to prevent and forbid, such Cursing and Swearing.

Ans. It undoubtedly is, Leviticus 5, 1.
for there is no Sin greater, or more provoking to God, than the profaning of
his Name; and therefore He has commanded this Leviticus 24, 15.
Sin to be punished with Death.

XXXVII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 101. May we then swear religiously by the Name of God?

Ans. Yes; either when the Magistrates demand it of the Subjects; or when
Necessity requires us thereby to confirm Exodus 22, 11. Nehemiah 13, 25.
Fidelity, and Truth, to the Glory of God, and the Safety of our Neighbor; for
such an Oath is Deutero. 6, 13. Heb. 6, 16.
founded on God's Word, and therefore was justly Geneses 21, 24. Jos. 9, 15,
19. 1 Samuel 24, 22. 2 Cor. 1, 23. Romans 1, 9.
used by the Saints, both in the Old and New Testament.

Quest. 102. May we also swear by Saints, or any other Creature?

Ans. No; for a lawful Oath is a Calling upon God, as the only one who knows
the Heart, that He will bear Witness to the Truth, and punish me if I swear 2
Corinthi. 1, 23.
faslely; which Honor is Mat. 5, 34.35.
due to no Creature.

XXXVIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 103d. What does God require in the fourth Command?

Ans. First, that the Ministry of the Gospel, and the Schools be Titus 1, 5. 1 Timothy 3, 14, 15. 1 Corinthi. 9, 11. 2 Timothy 2, 2. and 3.15.
maintained; and that I, especially on the Sabbath, Leviticus 23, 3.
that is on the Day of Rest, Act 2, 42.46. 1 Corin. 14, 19.29.31.
diligently frequent 1 Corinthi. 11, 33.
the Church of God, to hear his Word, to use the Sacraments, 1 Timothy 2, 1.
publicly to call upon the Lord, and contribute to the Relief of the 1
Corinthi, 16, 2.
Poor, as becomes a Christian. Secondly, that all the Days of my Life I cease
from my Evil Works, and yield myself to the Lord, to work by His Holy Spirit in
me; and thus Isaiah 66, 23.
begin in this Life the eternal Sabbath.

XXXIX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 104th. What does God require in the fifth Command?

Ans. That I show all Honor, Love, and Fidelity to my Father and Mother, and
all in Authority over me, and Ephesians. 6, 1.2. etc. Col. 3, 18.20. Ephesians 5, 22.
Romans 1, 31.
submit myself to their good Instruction and Correction, with due Obedience;
and also patiently bear with their Proverbs 23, 22. 1 Peter 2, 8.
Weaknesses and Infirmities, since it pleases Ephesians 6, 4.9. Col. 3, 19.21.
Romans 13. Matthew 22, 21.
God to govern us by their Hand.

XL. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 105th. What does God require in the sixth Command?

Ans. That neither in Thoughts, nor Words, nor Gestures, much less in Deeds, I
dishonor, hate, wound or Mat. 5, 21.22. Proverbs 12.18. Matthew 26, 52.
kill my Neighbor, by myself or by another; but that I lay Ephesians 4, 26.
Romans 12, 19. Mat. 5, 39.40.
aside all desire of Revenge: also, that I Mat. 4, 5 6.7. Colossians 2.23.
hurt not myself, or wilfully expose myself to any Danger. Wherefore also the
Magistrate Geneses 9, 6. Matthew 26, 52. Romans 13, 4.
is armed with the Sword, to prevent Murder.

Quest. 106th. But this Command seems only to speak of Murder?

Ans. In forbidding Murder, God teaches us, that He abhors the Causes thereof;
such as James 1, 20. Galatians 5, 20.
Envy, Romans 1, 29.
Hatred, 1 John 2.9.
Anger, and Desire of Revenge; and that 1 John 3, 15.
He accounts all these as Murder.

Quest. 107th. But is it enough that we don't kill any Man in the Manner
mentioned above?

Ans. No; for when God forbids Envy, Hatred, and Anger; He commands us to Mat.
22, 39. and 7.12.
love our Neighbor as ourselves; to show Romans 12, 10.
Patience, Peace, Ephesians 4, 2. Galatians 6, 1.2. Matthew 5, 5. Romans 12, 18.
Meekness, Exodus 23.5.
Mercy, and all Kindness toward Him, Matthew 5, 45.
and prevent his Hurt as much as in us lies: And that we Romans 12, 20.
do good, even to our Enemies.

XLI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 108th. What does the seventh Command teach us?

Ans. That all Uncleanness is accursed Leviticus 18, 27.
of God, and that therefore we must with all our Hearts Judges 22, 23.
detest the same, and live 1 These. 4, 3.4.
chastely and temperately, whether in Heb. 13, 4. 1 Corin. 7, 4.9.
holy Wedlock, or in a single Life.

Quest. 109th. Does God forbid in this Command, only Adultery, and such like
gross Sins?

Ans. Since both our Body and Soul are Temples of the Holy Ghost, He commands
us to preserve them pure and holy; therefore he forbids all unchaste Actions,
Ephesians 5, 3. 1 Corinthi. 6.18.
Gestures, Words, Thoughts, Matthew 5, 28.
Desires, and whatever Ephesians 5, 18. 1 Corin. 15, 33.
can entice Men thereto.

XLII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 110th. What does God forbid in the eighth Command?

Ans. God forbids not only those 1 Corinthi. 6, 10.
Thefts and 1 Corinthi. 5, 10.
Robberies which are punishable by the Magistrate; but He comprehends under the
Name of Theft, all wicked Tricks and Devices, whereby we design to Luke 3, 14.
1 Thessaloni. 4, 6.
appropriate to ourselves the Goods which belong to our Neighbor; whether it
be by Force, or under the Appearance of right; as by unjust Proverbs 11, 1.
Weights, Else, Eze. 45, 9.10.11. Deuterono. 25.13.
Measures, fraudulent Merchandise, false Coins, Psalms 15.5. Luke 6, 35.
Usury, or by any other Way forbidden by God; as also all 1 Corinthi. 6, 10.
covetousness, all Abuse and Waste of his Gifts.

Quest. 111. But what does God require in this Command?

Ans. That I promote the Advantage of my Neighbor in every Instance I can or
may; and deal with him as I Matthew 7, 12.
desire to be dealt with by others; further also that I faithfully labor, so
that I Proverbs 5.16. Ephesians 4, 28.
may be able to relieve the needy.

XLIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 112. What is required in the ninth Command?

Ans. That I bear false Witness Proverbs 19.5.9. and 21.28.
against no Man; nor falsify Psalm 15.3.
any Man's Words: That I be no Backbiter, Romans 1, 29.
or Slanderer; that I do not judge, or join Matthew 7, 1 etc. Luke 6, 37.
in condemning any Man rashly or unheard; but that I Luke 19.11.
avoid all Sorts of Lies and Deceit, as the proper Works Prove. 12, 22 and 13.5.
of the Devil, unless I would bring down upon me the heavy Wrath of God:
Likewise that in Judgment and all other Dealings, I love the Truth, speak it
uprightly 1 Corinthi. 13, 6. Ephesians 4, 25.
and confess it: Also that I defend and promote, 1 Peter 4, 8.
as much as I am able, the Honor and good Character of my Neighbor.

XLIV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 113. What does the tenth Command require of us?

Ans. That even the smallest Inclination or Thought, contrary to any of God's
Commands, never rise in our Hearts; but that at all Times we hate all Sin with
our whole Hearts, Rem. 7, 7, etc.
and delight in all Righteousness.

Quest. 114. But can those who are converted to God, perfectly keep these
Commands?

Ans. No; but even the holiest Men while in this Life, have only small
Beginnings of this Romans 7, 14.
Obedience, yet so, that with a Romans 7, 22.15. etc. James 2, 20.
sincere Resolution, they begin to live, not only according to some, but all
the Commands of God.

Quest. 115. Why will God then have the ten Commands so strictly preached,
since no Man in this Life can keep them?

Ans. First, that all our Life Time, we may learn 1 John 1, 9. Psalm 32, 5.
more and more to know our sinful Nature, and thus become the more earnest in
seeking the Remission of Sin, and Righteousness in Christ: Likewise, Romans 7,
24.
that we constantly endeavor and pray to God for the Grace of the Holy Spirit,
1 Corinthi. 9, 24. Phil. 3, 12.13.14.
that we may become more and more conformable to the Image of God, till we
arrive at the Perfection proposed to us, in a Life to come.

OF PRAYER. XLV. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 116th. Why is Prayer necessary for Christians?

Ans. Because it is that chief Part of Psalm 50, 15.
Thankfulness which God requires of us: And also because God will give His
Grace and Holy Spirit to those only who with sincere Desires continually ask
them of Him, and Matthew 7, 7.8. Luke 11, 9.13. Matthew 13, 12. Psalm 50, 15.
are thankful for them.

Quest. 117th. What are the Requisites of that Prayer, which is acceptable to
God, and which He will hear?

Ans. First, that we from the Heart pray to the one true God only, who has
John 4, 22.
manifested himself in His Word, for all Things he has commanded us, to ask of
Him: Romans 8, 26. 1 John 5, 14.
Secondly, that we rightly and thoroughly know our Need and Misery, John 4,
23.24. Psalm 145.18.
that so we may 2 Chronicles. 20, 12.
deeply humble ourselves in the Presence of His divine Majesty; thirdly, that
we be fully persuaded that He, notwithstanding we are p unworthy of it, will,
for the Sake of Christ our Lord, certainly Psalm 2, 11. and 34.18.19. Isaiah
66, 2.
hear our Prayer, as He has Romans 10, 14. and 8.15.16. James 1, 6, etc.
promised us in his Word. John 14, 13. Daniel 9, 17.18. Matthew 7, 8. Psalm
143, 1.


Quest. 118th. What Has God commanded us to ask of Him?

Ans. All James 1, 17. Matthew 6, 33.
Things necessary for Soul and Body; which Christ our Lord has comprised, in
that Prayer He himself Mat. 6, 9.10 etc. Luke 11, 2. etc.
has taught us.

Quest. 119. What are the Words of that Prayer?

Ans. Our Father which art in Heaven, Hollowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come.
Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this Day our daily
Bread, and forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors, and lead us not
into Temptation; but deliver us from Evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, the Power,
and the Glory, forever and ever, Amen.

XLVI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 120. Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus "OUR FATHER?

Ans. That immediately, in the very Beginning of our Prayer, He might excite in
us a Child-like Reverence for, and Confidence in God, which are the Foundation
of our Prayer; namely, that God is become our Father in Christ, Matthew 6, 9.
and will much less deny us what we ask of Him in true Faith, than our Parents
Mat. 7, 9.10.11. Luke 11, 11. Isaiah 49, 15.
will refuse us earthly Things.

Quest. 121. Why is it here added, WHICH ART IN HEAVEN?

Ans. Lest we should form any Jeremiah 23, 24. Acts 17, 24.
earthly Conceptions of God's Heavenly Majesty, and that we Romans 10, 12.
may expect from His Almighty Power all Things necessary for Soul and Body.

XLVII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 122d. Which is the first Petition?

Ans. Matthew 6, 9.

to know Thee, and to Psalm (...) 19, 13^.138. Luke 1, 46. Psalm 145, 8 9.
sanctify, glorify and praise Thee, in all thy Works, in which Thy Power,
Wisdom, Goodness, Justice, Mercy and Truth, are clearly displayed; and further
also, that we may so order and direct or whole Lives, our Thoughts, Words and
Actions, as that Thy Name may never be blasphemed, but rather Psalm 115, 1. and
71, 8.
honored and praised, on our Account.

XLVIII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 123d. Which is the Second Petition?

Ans. Matthew 6, (...).
"THY KINGDOM COME;" that is, rule us so by Thy Word and Spirit, that we may
Matthew 6 33. Psalm 119, 5.
submit ourselves more and more to Thee; preserve and Psalm 51, 18.
increase thy Church, destroy the 1 John 3 8. Romans 1^. (...).
Works of the Devil, and all Violence which would exalt itself against Thee;
and also, all wicked counsels devised against thy holy Word; till the full
Reve. 22, 17.20.
Perfection of thy Kingdom takes Place, 1 (...) 15 28.
wherein Thou shall be all in all.

XLIX. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 124. Which is the third Petition?

Ans. Matthew 6, 10.
"THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN." That is, grant that we and all
Men may renounce Matthew 16, 24. Titus 2, 12.
our own Will, and without murmuring Luke 22, 42.
obey Thy Will which is only good; that so every one may attend to and 1 Corin.
7, 24. Ephesians. 4, 1.
perform the Duties of his Station and Calling as willingly and faithfully, as
the Psalm 103, 20.
Angels do in Heaven.

L. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 125th. Which is the fourth Petition?

Ans. Matt. 6, 11.
"GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD; That is, be pleased to provide us with all
Things Psalm. 145, 15. Mat. 6, 25. etc.
necessary for the Body, that we may thereby acknowledge Thee to be the only
Fountain of all Acts 17.25, and 14, 17.
Good, and that neither our Care nor Industry nor even Thy Gifts, can 1 Cor.
15, 58. Deuteronomy. 8, 3. Psalm. 127, 1.2.
profit us without Thy Blessing and therefore that we may withdraw our Trust
from all Creatures, and place Psalm. 62, 11. and 55, 23.
it alone in Thee.

LI. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 126. Which is the fifth Petition?

Ans. " Matt. 6, 12.
AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS, AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS;" that is, be pleased, for
the Sake of Christ's Blood, Psalm 51, 1. 1 John, 2, 1.2.
not to impute to us poor Sinners, our Transgressions, nor that Depravity which
always cleaves to us: even as we feel this Evidence of Thy Grace in us, that it
is our firm Resolution from the Heart to Matt. 6, 14.15.
forgive our Neighbor.

LII. LORD'S DAY.
Quest. 127. Which is the sixth Petition?

Ans. " Matthew 6, 13.
AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL;" that is, since we
are so weak in ourselves, that we cannot stand John 5, 5. Psalm. 103, 14.
a Moment; and besides this, since our mortal Enemies, the Devil, 1 Pet. 5, 8.
the Ephesians 6, 12. John 15, 19.
World, and our own Romans 7, 23. Gal. 5, 17.
Flesh, cease not to assault us; do Thou therefore preserve and strengthen us
by the Power of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may not be overcome in this spiritual
Warfare; Matthew 26, 41. Mark 13.33.
but constantly and strenuously may resist our Foes, till at last we 1
Thessalo. 3, 13. and 5.23.
obtain a complete Victory.

Quest. 128. How do thou conclude thy Prayer?

Ans. " Mat. 6, 13.
FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, THE POWER, AND THE GLORY FOREVER," that is, all
these we ask of Thee, because Thou being our King and Almighty, art willing and
able to Romans 10, 12. 2 Peter 2, 9.
give us all Good; and all this we pray for, that thereby, not we, but Thy Holy
Name may John 14, 13. Psalm 115, 1. Philippians 4, 20.
be glorified forever.

Quest. 129th. What does the Word "AMEN" signify?

Ans. " 2 Corinthi. 1, 20. 2 Timothy 2, 13.
AMEN," signifies, it shall truly and certainly be; for my Prayer is more
assuredly heard of God, than I feel in my Heart, that I desire these Things of
Him.
