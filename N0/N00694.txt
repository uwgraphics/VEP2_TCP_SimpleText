By His Excellency Richard Earl of Bellomont, Captain General and Governor in
Chief of His Majesty's Province of New York, etc. A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS I have thought fit, by and with the Advice and Consent of His
Majesty's Council for the Province of New York, to call a General Assembly, and
being informed, That by some Unlawful and Indirect Courses, the People have
been heretofore Interrupted in their Freedom of Elections of their
Representatives. And being resolved That for the future His Majesty's Subjects
of this Province should not be molested in the Freedom of their Choice of
Assembly-Men, but that the same should be regularly done, according to the Laws
of England, and this Province. I do therefore strictly Require and Command all
Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers whom these Presents may
Concern, That they in their Respective Stations do take effectual Care that
there be a Free and Fair Election of Members for the ensuing Assembly. And that
timely Notice be given to the Freeholders in each respective City and County
within this Province, to prevent any the like Unlawful and Indirect Practices
in the said Elections, as they will answer the Contrary at their utmost Perils,
as Enemies to his Majesty's Government, and the Peace and Prosperity of this
Province.

Given at New York the Seventh Day of April, School. and in the Tenth Year of the
Reign of Our Sovereign Lord, WILLIAM the Third, by the Grace of God, of
England, Scotland, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Bellomont.

God Save the KING.
