New Haven, January 1731. 2.
Our Sweeper having lately buried his Spouse, and accidentally hearing of the
Death and Will of his deceased Cambridge Brother, has conceived a violent
Passion for his Relict. And, as Love softens the Mind and disposes to Poetry,
he has eased himself in the following Strains, which he transmits to the
charming Widow, is the first Essay of his Courtship.

1
MIstress Ab -- y,
To you I fly,
You only can relieve me,
To you I turn, for you I burn,
If you will but believe me.
2
Then gentle Dame,
Admit my Flame.
And grant me my Petition,
If you deny,
Alas! I die
In pitiful Condition.
3
Before the News
Of your poor Spouse
Had reached us at New Haven.
My dear Wife died
Who was my Bride
In Anno Eighty seven.
4
Thus being free,
Let Us both agree
To join our Hands, for I do
Boldly aver
A Widower
Is fittest for a Widow.
5
You may be sure
It Is not your Dower
I make this flowing Verse on;
In these smooth Lays
I only praise
The Glories of your Person.
6
For the whole that
Was left by Mat,
Fortune to me has granted
In equal Store,
I Have one Thing more,
Which Matthew long had wanted
7
No Teeth, it is true,
You have to show,
The Young think Teeth inviting,
But silly Youths!
I love those Mouths
Where there is no fear of biting.
8
A leaky Eye,
That Is never dry
These woeful Times is fitting,
A wrinkled Face
Adds solemn Grace
To Folk devout at Meeting.
9
Thus to go (...)
I would pen down
Your Charms from Head to Foot,
Set all your Glory
In Verse before ye,
But I Have no Mind to do it.
10
Then haste away
And make no Stay,
For soon as you come hither,
We'll eat and sleep.
Make Beds and sweep.
And smoke and talk together.
11
But if, my Dear,
I must move there.
Toward Cambridge strait I Will set me.
To Touze the Hay
On which you lay,
If Age and You will let me
Thus Father Ab -- y left his Spouse,
As rich as Church or College Mouse
Which is sufficient Invitation
To serve the College in his Station.
