of their Majesty's Province of New York, Province of Pennsylvania, County of
New Castle, and the Territories and Tracts of Land depending thereon, in
America, and Vice Admiral of the same.
A PROCLAMATION.
Province of New York, ss.
WHEREAS, there is Actual War between our Sovereign Lord and Lady, William and
Mary, by the Grace of God of England, Scotland France and Ireland King and
Queen, Defenders of the Faith, etc., and the French King. And whereas, I have
received information that the French have designed a squadron of Ships, with
Land Forces, against the Province of New York. To the end that the inhabitants
thereof may be in greater readiness to unite their Strength against the enemy,
I have therefore thought fit, and do hereby charge and command, that the
Inhabitants of every town throughout the Province do, at their own charge, in
the most convenient place, forthwith erect a Beacon, which, upon the appearance
of any Squadron of Ships on the Coast or Alarm given, they are to set on Fire;
that all persons may have Notice thereof. And I do hereby require all the
Inhabitants, (excepting those of the city and county of Albany, and counties of
Ulster and Duchess county,) that upon such alarm and firing of the Beacon, they
drive their cattle into the woods, and immediately repair with their Arms and
Ammunition, to their respective Officers, who are likewise hereby commanded to
march them with all expedition to the city of New York And I expect a due
compliance herein from all Persons, as they will answer the same at their
utmost Peril.

Given at Fort William Henry, the 25 th day of August, 1693. Annoq. Regni Regis
Et Reginae Gulielmi and Mariae Angliae, etc., quinto. BEN. FLETCHER.

God Save King William and Queen Mary.
