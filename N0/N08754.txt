Britannia's Intercession FOR THE Happy Deliverance of John Wilkes, Esquire etc.
At the beginning of this intercession, the orator shall pronounce, with an
audible voice, one of these passages.
WHEN B*** turns from the error of his way, and does that which is seemly
and good, he shall wear his played in peace. Scots Journ. To Wilkes belong
freedom and greatness of spirit, though many have devised against him, and
complied not with the words of his mouth. North Briton. Through the spirit of
Wilkes we are yet in the land of freedom, because his exertion in that point
fails not. Polit. Regist. Give thanks, O ye people, give thanks unto Wilkes,
for he is mighty amongst us. Let. to H -- y. O let the wickedness of a
favorite come to an end, but establish the upright and free born. No. 45. We
waited patiently for Wilkes, and he came unto us, and he heard our moan. Gaz.
DEarly beloved countrymen, Wilkes's speeches urges us in several places to
acknowledge and confess our gratitude and praises, and that we should not
dissemble nor hide them before the face of our country, but confess them with a
joyful and merry heart, to the end that we may enjoy a continuance of the same,
through his fortitude and plainness. And although we ought at all times to
acknowledge our favors from great men, so ought we especially so to do when we
come together, to render thanks for the great benefits we have received from
Wilkes's hands, to speak in his praise, to hear every speech, and to plead
those things which are constitutional and requisite both for freedom and
liberty.

Then the orater shall say.
O Wilkes! be thou our strength.

Ans. And we will sound forth thy name abroad on the earth.

Orat. O Wilkes! continue thy aid.

Ans. O Wilkes! continue thy aid.

Here all standing, the orator shall say,
Honor be to thee, O Wilkes!

Ans. As thou were in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty
without end. Amen.

Then the People shall chaunt,
O Come, let us sing unto Wilkes, let us rejoice in the spirit of his writings.

Let us thank him with our lips, and show ourselves glad in him with huzzas.

For Wilkes is a great writer, and a writer above all writers.

In his brain are all the quirks of the law, and their effects are known to him
also.

The N****B***** is his, and he made it, his head prepared the matter thereof.

For he is the man that shows wonders, and we are the people that read the
work of his hands.

If you would hear him speak, turn not away, as in his provocation, when an
exile, and as in the day of tribulation in the King's Bench prison.

When our great men tempted him, proved him and saw him staunch.

Several years was he grieved with this set of wretches, and said, It is a
people who want slavery and famine. They know not my worth.

Unto whom I swear by Magna Charta that they should not gain their end.

Honor be to thee, O Wilkes!

As thou were in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without
end. Amen.

Then shall follow these verses, one verse by the orator, and another by the
people.
O Give thanks unto Wilkes, for he is sensible, and his sensibility continues
for ever.

Let all them give thanks whom he has defended, and delivered from the power
of arbitrary seizures.

Many a time have some men fought against him, after the writing of number
Forty-five.

Yea, many a time have they vexed him, but they have not utterly prevailed over
him.

They have spread their net to destroy him without a cause, ye, even without a
cause did they put him afar off.

They have laid a net for his feet, and have happily fallen into it themselves.

Great is his courage, and great his perseverance, yea and his capacity is
wonderful.

Wilkes sits up the fallen poor and brings down oppressors to the ground.

Let your voice be for the man of your right hand, and upon the man who has
supported you in the time of your trouble.

We will not go back from thee, O Wilkes! O let us be free, and we will sing
forth thy name.

Honor be to thee, O Wilkes!

As thou were in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without
end. Amen.

WILKES, thou have been our glory from one tribulation to another.

Before the Essay was brought forth, or the North Briton was made, thou wast
the man of liberty who defendest our cause, and stood up in our behalf.

Thou turnest B*** to distraction, and again thou say, Rise no more to
perplex this free people.

For all thy intrigues were in my sight, they are but as yesterday in mine eyes.

But he told, thou shall dread my displeasure, and be afraid of my spirited
indignation.

I have set thy misdeeds before thee, and thy secret fawnings in the light of
thine own eyes.

Behold, who regards the power of thy wrath? it is even as a weapon without
sharpness.

Thou art full of nothingness, and art empty for lack of true knowledge.

Honor be to thee, O Wilkes!

As thou were in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without
end. Amen.

The lecture appointed for this intercession, is taken out of the Chronicles,
the twelfth chapter, beginning at the forty-fifth verse.
NOW there was in the reign of G***** the king, a mighty spirit of tribulation.
And the great men of the land were laying upon the people burdens of great
weight, yea, heavier burdens than were home by their fathers, or their fathers
farthers before them. And they cried out unto the elders, and complained for
lack of relief. (Now the elders were deaf to their cries, and they minded not
the daily lamentation which they made) And they cried yet louder and louder, so
that the whole land was pierced with the sound thereof. And behold, in process
of time, that there arose up a man, (who was also an elder, and a colonel of
the guard, in the land of Buckingham) who had compassion upon them; and he
opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that you are oppressed and
agrieved, and that your taskmasters lay upon you more than you are able to
bear. Behold I myself will speak unto this people who do evil continually, and
will require a reason for that which they now do. Be ye therefore, patient,
having peace among yourselves, and you shall be filled. Now it came to pass
that after a short time this good man did as he promised unto the people. And
he spoke time after time of their tribulation, and wrote even letters with his
own hand, complaining of the rulers in a free country. And behold, they were
affronted thereat, and they were full of envy against this man, because he had
spoken well of the people. And when it was so that he had wrote even a
forty-fifth letter unto them, that they took him out of the house of his
habitation, and put him into a fast place, which place is called a tower even
unto this day. And they looked into his dwelling, and searched for his papers,
and all his secret workings, and they took them every one. And behold, when
they had found these, that they took him from the fast place, and banished him
afar off beyond the sea. And he was left there, and commanded not to return;
for behold it was seemly unto the elders that he should be put away from
amongst them.

Thus ends the first lecture.
O All ye people praise ye Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O ye printers of the land, praise ye Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O ye printers devils, and their agents of whatsoever denomination, praise ye
Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O all ye booksellers, pamphlet-stitchers, and bookbinders, praise ye Wilkes,
bless him and huzza him for ever!

O Williams, praise Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O Bingley, praise Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O all ye glaziers of the city, praise ye Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for
ever!

O ye chandlers of grease, praise ye Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O ye uncorrupted, non-bribed, and independent electors of the city, praise ye
Wilkes, bless him, and huzza him for ever!

O ye glorious and ever-famed freeholders of Middlesex, praise ye Wilkes, bless
him, and huzza him for ever.

O all ye ballad singers, hawkers, and pedlars, praise ye Wilkes, bless him,
and huzza him for ever!

Honor be to thee, O Wilkes!

As thou were in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, praised without
end. Amen.

The second lecture is taken out of the book of Prophecies, second coapter,
beginning at the twelfth verse.
WHATSOEVER things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that
we through instruction and understanding, might see into the depths thereof. Now
the great secret is found out which was before hid from our eyes, and we see
clearly as at noon day. In the beginning was a favorite, and this favorite
was B***, and B*** was with the K***. Many were the things wrought by him, and
without him was not any evil done that was done. In him was pride, and that
pride was found to be the destruction of men Now there was a man returned from
the land whereunto he was sent, and also persecuted, whose name was Wilkes, the
same came back for a plague unto evil doers, And he abode within the gates of
the city many days, and put his name among those who were to be chosen elders
of the land. But they cast him from among them so that he was not one of the
elect, and he went his way. Howbeit he had in another roll his name written (as
is recorded in the Chronicles) and he was chosen. Now when B*** heard thereof,
and saw what they had done amongst them, he was very wroth, and wist not what
to do, for this same man had stung him aforetime So he stirred up his fellows
against him, to persecute him, that he might not abide with them. And behold
they grew exceeding powerful, insomuch that they took him away from the people,
and put him in a strong hold. And the people grew very wroth, and was
displeased thereat. And they assembled in great companies by thousands, and
would not be at rest, because of the things which were done. And they made
great noises together; and many got for themselves chalk which was white for to
make a mark on every man as he passed, thus, 45 And this mark was put upon the
coverings of the heads and the backs of all who passed this way or that way in
honor of their great idols, Wilkes and Liberty. Until the even of many days
did they do these things.

Thus ends the second lecture.
Then shall be said by the orator and the People.
BE merry, O my countrymen, let your hearts be filled with gladness; and cheer
up your souls with a song.

Be ye sure that he shall be released: it is he that defends us; and not our
Twitchers; we are his friends and the delight of his heart.

O go your way into the city with huzzas, and unto your homes with his praise,
show favor unto Wilkes, and rejoice in his name.

For Wilkes is ever firm, his patriotism is everlasting, and his praise will
endure for ever.

Honor be to thee, O Wilkes!

As thou were in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without
end. Amen.

Then shall be said the Wilkonion creed, by the orator, and the people
repeating it after him.
I Believe in Wilkes, the firm patriot, maker of number 45. Who was born for
our good. Suffered under arbitrary power. Was banished and imprisoned. He
ascended into purgatory, and returned some time after. He ascended here with
honor, and sits amidst the great assembly of the people, where he shall
judge both the favorite and his creatures. I believe in the spirit of his
abilities, that they will prove to the good of our country. In the resurrection
of liberty, and the life of universal freedom for ever. Amen

Then the orator shall say,
O Wilkes! be still thy attention upon us.

Answ. And lend us thy assistance.

Orat. O aid thy country!

Answ, And give help to the ignorant when they call upon thee.

Orat. Arm thyself with patience.

Answ. And make thy loyal friends happy.

Orat. Save us from lethargy.

Answ. And rouse us from slumber.

Orat. Make peace in our city, O Wilkes!

Answ. Because there is no other that has such influence but thou O Wilkes!

Orat. Wilkes, make clean our member house.

Answ. And be with us for ever.

A prayer for a king.
MOST gracious providence! on the best of monarchs we beseech thee to shower
down the best of thy blessings. Let true wisdom govern every action of his
life. Attacked by favorites and tools, venal and corrupt locusts, O arm him
with strength to overcome their fallacy and withstand all their temptations.
Let not effrontery or arrogance prevail against him; nor the dictates of
presumption preside where majesty and power join hand in hand. From evil
aspersions and false accusations ever shield him. From all party influence
protect him! and may justice for ever be the rule of his conduct. With mercy
and compassion endow him for the sake of his country. Amen.

Another for wicked ministers.
YE sons of ambition and pride, ye workers of evil, and the destroyers of the
poor* woe, woe, woe belong unto you wherever ye dwell. O, ye gods! have mercy
upon them. Teach them to act like men and behave as beings capable of feeling
and fraught with reason. O turn the hearts of all pensioners, placemen, and
favorites from the present mode of action. Give them to known and to feel for
the necessities of the poor and indigent; and that, instead of bowing,
scraping, and cringing for a place in the court, it would much better become
them to exert their utmost abilities (as the servants of the public) in
endeavoring to lower the prices of all the necessaries of life, that the poor
may rejoice, and the heart of the widow be uplifted with joy. Teach them
submission to the will of their master, and to be always attentive to those
things which concern the public and the common weal in general Give them this
spirit of ambition of doing good to their country, and we ask no more for the
sake of peace and good order. Amen.

NOW to all men be consolation, friendship, and good will, from this time
forth, and forevermore. Amen.

Then the clerk shall set five staves of the CLI. psalm, common measure.
ALL people who on the earth do dwell,
And those that skim the sea,
With one accord, and heart and voice,
A WILKITE let him be.
As for those men who highly live,
And bear a partial sway,
And will not for their freedom rouse,
Shall see a woeful day.
Now in the congregation then,
Ye Britons, all agree;
Give thanks to Wilkes with one accord,
Who purchased liberty.
Do not withdraw yourselves away,
When he stands most in need;
Then will he grant your inmost wish,
And save your childrens seed.
The people who in London dwell
Shall come to him full thick;
And all his foes who do rebel,
The earth and dust shall lick.
A Political and Constitutional SERMON.
Book of Prophecies, Chap. i. Ver. 45, 46, 47. And there shall come a fox from
the north, yea, and a he-lion shall rouse himself in the south, and they shall
be at war, and shall not dwell at quiet. And there shall come distresses and
tumults upon the land, even in this great city, and the oppressed shall rise up
by hundreds and by thousands And in these days locusts shall overspread all the
face of the earth.


IN the words before us, the prophet seems clearly to indicate to us the
troublesome vexations and disturbing animosities which must of necessity
prevail, in some future time, amongst a particular people. And he endeavors to
point out the beginning of these troubles in so very distinct a manner, as if
he designed to give the inhabitants a timely warning of this dreadful
catastrophe, that, by proper means, they might, in some measure, prevent its
coming so severe upon them as utterly to destroy them in their sins. He not
only prophesies in general terms, but is also particularly careful respecting
the time and place when and where these things shall come to pass.

A fox, says he, shall come from the NORTH -- a lion from the SOUTH -- and
there shall come distresses in THIS great city -- and in THESE days locusts
shall overspread the face of the land. So you find, my brethren, that when the
fox is come from the north -- and the he-lion has rouzed himself in the south
-- distresses and tumults are to be expected in the city, and over the whole
face of the land; and, that hundreds and thousands of oppressed people shall
rise up together -- and, when these things are so far accomplished, then, in
THESE days, locusts shall come in upon us and dwell on the land.

Having thus considered the words in general, as they stand before us, it may
be necessary, for the further illustration of this passage, to consider
particularly,

I. What we are to understand by A fox coming from the North.

II. How, and in what manner, a he-lion is to rouse himself in the south, and
why they shall be at war, and shall not dwell at quiet.

III. Consider what distresses and tumults shall oppress the land, so that the
oppressed shall rise up by hundreds and by thousands.

IV. Give some description of the locusts which are to overspread the face of
the whole land. And,

Lastly, Conclude with some practical improvement upon the whole. And,

First, What we are to understand by A fox coming from the north.

It may appear necessary, for the right apprehending of the text, now under our
consideration, that the book of Prophecies, was, originally, wrote in London;
and therefore, when the prophet says, "even in this great city," he must be
understood to mean that place: and of course it follows, that the land spoken
of is no other than that of South-Britain, on the north of which lies that
part which is called Scotland, from whence our admired penman has informed us
the fox should come.

And, as it may not be altogether disagreeable, or in the least unworthy the
notice of my hearers, I will first give a short description of these animals,
and then proceed. In general, foxes are very remarkable for their deep cunning.
They will, when pursued by hunters, make urine on their tails, and strike them
upon the faces of the dogs. When trapped by a gin, they have been known to bite
of the part confined, and so escaped. And being hungry, they feign themselves
dead, on whom the fowls lighting, for prey, they rise and devour them. But, as
there are different kinds of foxes, so their artful inventions are as various.
That kind of fox, mentioned by the prophet, the generality of commentators
agree to be the BOOT-FOX, and describe him with an extraordinary long head,
smooth tongue, and remarkable long eyes. His legs are covered with a kind of
mottled, woolly furr, though bare at the joints of his knees, and his feet to
be cloven. This fox, my beloved, it is well known, has been amongst us for some
time, and did, originally, come from the north, answering every description
that is given of him by the Prophet in the former part of this chapter,
beginning at the sixteenth verse: And the fox that shall appear in high places,
and, by his cunning, get even into the houses of the most high, shall be a
favorite fox. He shall feed upon dainties, and he shall have influence over
many foxes; yea, and lambs shall lie down before him and do reverence. But the
lions of spirit, and the wolves, and their young ones, shall seek his
destruction continually. From hence it is plain, that this same fox is now
amongst us, and has been seen COUR^ing it up and down in high forests, and, by
his secret fawnings, and detestable undermining attempss, he has got into good
feed, and that, as it were, unobserved. We have, my brethren, too long borne
with his ferriting scratches; we have already reason to curse the time that
ever such an animal existed amongst us. O my beloved, take care! be upon the
watch! this hungry Reynard still lives -- still acts -- still rules! and unless
the other part of this prophecy had taken place, we had been utterly undone for
ever. Having considering thus far, I shall proceed, in the next place, to show,

Secondly, How, and what manner, a he-lion is to rouse himself in the south,
and why they shall be at war with each other, so as never to dwell at quiet. If
our eyes my beloved, have been in the least open, we surely must have
perceived, that the words of the Prophet, in this point also, have been fully
verified and brought to pass. -- Yea, and a he-lion shall rouse himself in the
SOUTH; that is, A he-lion shall rouse himself in ENGLAND You cannot be
ignorant, nay, you must be sensible, that, of all beasts, the lion is the most
courageous. The pleasing contrast the Prophet has here drawn, by way of
simile, cannot be sufficiently admired. Than the fox and the lion nothing can
be more directly apposite; not only the figure and size, but nature and
principle. The one, unused to slattery and deceit, timidity and cowardice; the
other, a noted partaker of each. With principles thus contrasted, no wonder
that each on each should cast so black an eye, and be at variance, and should
not dwell at quiet. We well know, however, that when a lion is brought from
abroad, in order to be brought under some restraint, he is confined in a
prison, wherein he may be kept from disturbing the quiet of those foxes that
are generally the most crafty, and are the most afraid of him. My brethren,
apply this particular to the times in which we live: behold and see if nothing
of this kind has yet come to pass amongst us. It was the way of the ancients
to write by way of fable, and our prophet has thought proper to adopt that
pleasing method above all others. To explain this part of our text, it may not
be amiss, therefore, to remark here, what we are to understand by a HE-LION.
This according to the sense of the learned, can mean no other than the resolute
Patriot, who has so much exerted himself in the behalf of his country; who has
ever kept a jealous eye on the designs and mean artifices of the favorite
boot-fox, and gloriously brought to open light what fear and cowardice have
been always ashamed to reveal. It is the noble exertion of this lion that has
so terrified the whole nest of foxes. He has, like Samson, knit them all
together, tail to tail, with a firebrand between each two, from which distress
and entanglement they know not how to extricate and deliver themselves. By way
of trial they have, however, cast him into a den; nevertheless, he still
continues to cause in them a dread, that easily they cannot conquer and
overcome: so that they still are at war with each other, and do not dwell at
quiet. -- Proceed we now to consider,

Thirdly, What distresses and tumults should oppress the land, so that the
oppressed shall rise up by hundreds and by thousands. And first, my brethren, I
shall consider the distresses -- Those who are any way acquainted with life and
the world, must, of consequence, perceive, how distress and misery fill our
streets. For the want of a proper supply of provisions, and the common
necessaries of life, how many of our poor have been snatched off in their
prime! Others advanced to old age, grey-hair'd subjects, tender fathers,
affectionatte mothers, loyal friends, and honest Britons, O! how have they been
taken from amongst us by the cruel usage of Poverty and Want! When corn and
provisions have been plenty; when Providence has crowned our harvests with
abundance; how have our poor been debarred from partaking thereof, while the
owners have stored their barns, and kept it shamefully back from those who were
starving with hunger. Not only were these practices, beloved, passed over and
winked at by men in power, but at that time it was known to be carried abroad
to enemies -- open enemies -- professed enemies! and sold cheaper to them, by
far, than we could possibly purchase at home. Add to this, the large quantities
of wheat continually being cast into the waters, which by long standing, had
been spoilt, and rendered useless -- even to the DESPISED POOR.

Who then can wonder at the risings of the people or be amazed at the tumults
(not abroad, but) at home? Is there not reason -- sufficient reason for these
murmurings and complaints among the lower class of the people? The Prophet
might very well lay a particular emphasis here -- and the oppressed SHALL rise
up, etc. -- Never had people more occasion to exert what little spirit they had
left in their own cause, before they were utterly destroyed. -- Thus things
were going on in a very foul way for their destruction. They saw them, and were
wise. Fair and humble means were at first tried; petitions were offered;
supplications were made to men in power, and to UNFEELING ministers whose
continual promises were, They WOULD assist; -- provisions SHOULD lowered in
their prices, and they might rely upon their IMMEDIATE consideration on and
dispatch. These promises, we are now sensible, were made to appease the noise
of the VULGAR, as they are styled, for never was any thing done in their behalf
in consequence of those promises, and they were left to shift for themselves,
and to do as well as people in their situation were capable of doing, without
THEIR assistance. -- In this manner were they kept in suspense, starving and to
starve, till Necessity (the mother of invention) taught them how to rise in
large bodies together, no longer to pray, but to demand. Then came forth, even
in this great city, multitudes of machanics, various in their professions, and
firm in their resolutions, exerting themselves in their own defense, choosing
rather to fall by the sword, than be in the midst of plenty dying for the want
of proper sustenance and nourishment.

Thus I have briefly considered the distresses and tumults which have come to
pass, according to the prophecy of the Prophet. I come now to give some
description of the locusts which are to overspread the face of the whole land.

And in these days, etc. As there are of foxes severals kinds, so of locusts
the same. But, in general, every species of this insect are accounted vile.
Their nature is to herd many together, therefore vast multitudes are resembled
by them. In Arabia, as well as in England, the people are infested with them;
but, in these times, they more particularly infest the latter. They generally
come upon corn, when ripe, and what they do not eat, they infect with their
touch. They die whole swarms together; and, after death, they poison the air,
and cause a pestilence. -- How happy our prophetic writer appears in his
expressions and similies, I leave to the determination of my hearers! Nothing
could have been more to the purpose in answering his design to paint to the
people the events of futurity, in this respect, than that of the locust.
According to the description I have given of that insect, how striking a
resemblance does it bear with the swarm of vile locusts which was daily found
in the western patt of our renouned city, where numbers have been seen to
assemble together in companies and flights, to accomplish their evil designs.
In the twelfth chapter of the Prophecies, the Prophet takes notice of the time
when they disappear, and what events follow, from verse 88 to verse 92. Now
after the locusts shall have perplexed the people, and have been even in one
place years two and five, they shall divide themselves apart. And it shall come
to pass, that when the old locusts shall die away, that there shall be great
joy and feasting among the people. But behold, they shall fear the coming of
another swarm, for they shall not know what they shall do. And the people shall
be divided amongst themselves what manner of swarm it shall be. But the
beginning thereof shall be destructive unto many. I have my beloved, quoted
thus much that ye be not misguided: locusts are amongst you; they are even come
with a great power: and, though the last swarm are separated, and are gone;
yet, take care, the beginning of these, you perceive, have already been
destructive unto many.

Having thus gone through the principal parts which I at first intended, I now
proceed to some practical improvement upon the whole, and will have done. And,

1. Seeing that a fox is come from the north, let us be watchful, and extremely
jealous, of every motion that may be made of his exertion. His cunning is deep;
his attempts sly; and deceit artful. He may be found to make urine of the
strongest taint upon his tail, and close your eyes in such a manner, that we
cannot pursue him in his intrigues. He may feign dead or inactive, but at last
rouse up and devour a multitude. It requires, therefore, the greatest diligence
and perseverance to prevent his becoming our detestable and inveterate
destroyer.

2. As we are encouraged by the presence of a lion, we ought not to be cast
down, grieve our spirits, and faint, as though no prospect of help were nigh.
-- The lion is a furious beast; hardships and difficulties, which appear so to
us, become as nothing to him; and we have already found, that his power ALONE
has defended us in our Houses -- in our Castles -- in our Possessions. We
should therefore be thankful, and rejoice that there is one power provided
against another, so that our attempts, for the liberty of our children, do not
entirely become of non-effect.

3. In all times of public distress and tumultuous proceedings, we should be
particularly careful how we think and act, neither to be seen defending our own
cause, or walking by the way-side Alluding to that meritorious action in St.
George's fields, namely, the fireing upon and killing several of his majesty's
subjects, as they were satisfying their curiosity thereabouts in seeing Mr.
(now Alderman) Wilkes.
, lest either by fire or sword we be destroyed, and our lives taken away. In
short, my brethren, to be in favor with the GREAT, let your conversation be
naught, lie down peaceably and be trod upon, resisting none who impose upon
you, and then! * * * * and then! * * * * O then!

4. Seeing that locusts of a new kind are come upon us, let us behold them a
while in their actions. If they oppress us, and, as the last swarm, blast every
gleam of hope, that may appear favorable in our behalf, we may expect little
good from them. if they direct themselves by the NORTH wind, and are governed
by that cold corner, it is reasonable to expect that we shall soon be in a
starving condition, since that wind carries with it a most omenous aspect, of
which we have been the too sad and uncomfortable spectators.

To conclude. Let every one be upon their guard. Whatever appears in the strict
eye of Reason, to carry with it the impression of Truth, a taste of true
Patriotism, and a love of Liberty and an universal Freedom, by all means let
that be first embraced. And I trust, my brethren, that these few hints, which I
have just thrown together, will not be unworthy your notice. May this discourse
have its desired effect upon you, and promote, in some degree, your fortitude
and courage under every imposition that may be lain upon you by a set of
arbitrary ******* and ******. Amen.

Now unto all men be consolation, friendship, and goodwill, from this time
forth, and for evermore. Amen.
