AT A GENERAL COURT Held at Boston, October 15. 1679.
THIS COURT being sensible of the solemn Rebukes of God upon his poor People
throughout this Land, from year to year, our Doings against the Lord having
provoked the eyes of his glory, so as that he has visited us with the Sword,
and since that, has given a Commission to the destroying Angel, in respect of
a sore and terrible Disease, which has been of long continuance, and more
contagious and mortal then in former times; and his holy Hand is in that way
stretched out still over some of our Plantations. And very lately, the Lord God
has called to contend by Fire, which has devoured a great part of that Town,
in whose welfare all New England is concerned; and therefore we have all cause
with bleeding hearts, to lament over the doleful Ruins and Desolations, which
the Lord for our iniquityes has in one day brought upon us: especially
considering, that at the same time, God is taking away from us the Fruits of
the earth, by a greater Blasting then heretofore we have had experience of. And
the Lords Watchmen, with the generality of serious Christians, are not without
sad thoughts of heart lest if we be not reformed by these things, God should
punish us yet seven times for our sins, yea and at last remove our Candlesticks
out of their places: and there are already some awful Symptoms of a Famine of
hearing the Word of the Lord; and other spiritual Judgments, calling upon us to
gather our selves together, in a way of solemn Humiliation and Repentance
before the Decree bring forth. Being also sensible that the Churches of Christ
abroad in the world, are wrestling with sore distressing difficultyes, in this
day of trouble, when the Children are come to the birth, but there is not
strength to bring forth,

Do therefore appoint the second Thursday in December next, to be observed as a
day of public Humiliation throughout this Jurisdiction, earnestly exhorting
all the Inhabitants thereof not only to confess but to forsake their Sins, that
so they may find mercy with God through Jesus Christ, and to cry mightily to
Heaven, as for pardon, so for Grace to reform, those evils that have by the
late Reverend Synod been witnessed against, and declared to be the provoking
procuring causes of the Lords Controversy with New England. As also to pray
that the Lord would remember his people in Europe, more especially in the Land
of our Forefathers Sepulchers, maintaining his own Cause as the matter may
require.

EDWARD RAWSON Secr.
