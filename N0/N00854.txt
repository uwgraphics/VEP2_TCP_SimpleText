world in Righteousness, by that Man whom He has Ordained. --

To the Christian Reader.
REader, I am a fool,
And have adventured
To play the fool this once for Christ,
The more his fame to spread
If this my foolishness
Help thee to be more wise,
I have attained what I seek,
And what I only prize.
Thou wonderest perhaps,
That I in Print appear,
Who to the Pulpit dwell so nigh,
Yet come so seldom there*
The God of Heaven knows
What grief to me it is,
To be withheld from Serving Chr^^;
No sorrow like to this.
This is the sorest pain
That I have felt or feel:
Yet have I stood some shocks that might
Make stronger Men to reel.
I find more true delight
In serving of my Lord,
Than all the good things upon Earth,
Without it, can afford.
And coull my strength endure,
That work ^ count so dear;
Not all the Riches of Peru.
Should hire me to forbear,
But I Am a ^risoner,
Under a heavy Chain:
Almighty Go^'s afflicting hand,
Does me per^rce restrain.
Yet some (I know) do judge,
Mine inability
To come abrod and do Christ's Work,
To be Melan^olly;
And that I Am not so weak,
As I my self ^onceit.
But who, in her things have found
Me so conceit yet?
Or who of ^ll my friends,
(...) ^als seen,
Can tell the time in seven years,
When I have dumpish been?
Some think my voice is strong,
Most times when I do Preach:
But ten days after what I feel
And suffer, few can reach.
My prisoned thoughts break forth,
When opened is the door,
With greater force and violence,
And strain my voice the more.
But vainly do they tell,
That I am growing stronger,
Who hear me speak in half an hour,
Till I can speak no longer.
Some for, because they see not
My cheerfulness to fail,
Nor that I am disconsolate,
Do think I nothing ail.
If they had born my griefs,
Their courage might have failed them,
And all the Town ( perhaps) have known
(Once and again) what ailed them.
But why should I complain
That have so good a God,
That does mine heart with comfort fill,
Even whilst I feel his Rod?
In God I have been strong,
When wearied and worn out;
And joy'd in him, when twenty woes
Assailed me round about.
Nor speak I this to boast;
But make Apology
For mine own self, and answer those
That fail in Charity.
I am (alas) as frail,
Impatient a Creature,
As most that tread upon the ground,
And have as bad a nature.
Let God be magnified,
Whose everlasting strength
Upholds me under sufferings
Of more than ten years length.
Through whose Almighty power
Although I am surrounded
With sorrows more than can be told,
Yet am I not confounded.
For his dear sake have I
This service undertaken,
For I am bound to honor Him,
Who has not me forsaken.
I am a Debtor too,
Unto the sons of Men;
Whom wanting other means, I would
Advantage with my Pen.
I would, But (ah!) my strength,
When tried, proves so small,
That to the ground without effect,
My wishes often fall.
Weak heads, and hands, and states,
Great things cannot produce:
And therefore I this little Piece
Have published for thine use.
Although the thing be small,
Yet my good will therein,
Is nothing less then if it had
A larger Volume been.
Accept it then in Love,
And read it for thy good:
There Is nothing in it can do thee hurt,
If rightly understood.
The God of Heaven grant
These Lines so well to speed,
That thou the things of thine own peace,
Through them may better heed,
And may be stirred up
To stand upon thy guard,
That Death and Judgment may not come,
And find thee unprepared.
Oh get a part in Christ,
And make the Judge thy Friend:
So shall thou be assured of
A happy, glorious end.
Thus prays thy real Friend,
And Servant for Christ's sake,
Who had he strength, would not refuse.
More pains for thee to take.
Michael Wigglesworth.

On the following Work, AND It Is AUTHOR.
A Verse may find him who a Sermon flies,
Says Herb^rt well. Great Truths to dress in Meeter;
Becomes a Preacher; who men's Souls does prize,
That Tr^^h in Sugar rolled may taste the sweeter,
No Cost too great, no Care too curious is
To set forth Truth, and win men's Souls to bliss.
In Costly Verse, and most laborious Rymes,
Are dish't up here Truths worthy most regard:
No Toys, nor Fables (Poets wonted Crimes)
Here be; but things of worth with Wit prepared.
Reader, fall too; and if thy taste be good,
Thou Wilt praise the Cook, and say, It Is choicest Food,
David's affliction bred us many a Psalm,
From Caves, from mouth of Graves that Singer sweet
Often tuned his Soul felt Notes: For not in's Calm,
But Storms, to write most Psalms God made him meet
Affliction turned this Pen to Poetry,
Whose serious streins do here before thee ly.
This Man with many griefs afflicted sore,
Shut up from speaking much in sickly Cave:
Thence painful leisure has to write the more,
And sends thee Counsels from the mouth of the Grave.
One foot in the other World long time has been:
Read, and thou wilt say, His heart is all therein.
Oh, happy Cave, that is to mount Nebo turned!
Oh, happy Prisoner that is at liberty
To walk through the other World! the Bonds are burned
(But nothing else) in Furnace fiery.
Such Fires unfetter Saints, and set more free
Their unscorch'd Souls for Christ's sweet company
Cheer on, sweet Soul, although in briny tears
Steept is thy feed, though dying every day;
Thy Sheaves shall joyful be, when Christ appears
To change our death and pain to life for ay.
The weepers now shall laugh; the jovial laughter*
Of vain ones here, shall turn to tears hereafter.
Judge right, and his restraint is our Reproof;
The Sins of Hearers, Preachers Lips do close,
And make that Tongue to cleave unto its roof,
Which else would check and cheer full freely those
That need. But from this E^ter comes some Meat*
And sw^^tness good from this affliction great.
In these vast Woods a Christian Poet Sings
(Where whilome Heathen wild were only found)
Of things to come, the last and greatest things,
Which in our Ears aloud sh^^^ ^ver sound.
Of Judgment dread, Hell, Heaven, Eternity;
Reader, think often, and help thy thoughts hereby.
J. Mitchel

A PRAYER Unto Christ the Judge OF THE WORLD.
O Dearest Dread, most glorious King,
I Will of thy justest Judgments sing:
Do thou my head and heart inspire,
To Sing aright, as I desire.
Thee, thee alone I Will invocate,
For I do much abominate
To call the Muses to mine aid:
Which is the Unchristian use, and trade
Of some that Christians would be thought,
And yet they worship worse then naught.
Oh! what a deal of Blasphemy,
And Heathenish Impiety,
In Christian Poets may be found,
Where Heathen gods with praise are Crowned,
They make Jehovah to stand by,
Till Juno, Venus, Mercury,
With frowning Mars, and thundering Jove.
Rule Earth below, and Heaven above.
But I have learnt to pray to none,
Save unto God in Christ alone.
Nor will I laud, no not in jest,
That which I know God does detest.
I reckon it a damning evil
To give Gods Praises to the Devil.
Thou, Christ, art he to whom I pray,
Thy Glory fain I would display.
Oh! guide me by thy sacred Sprite
So to indite, and so to write,
That I thine holy Name may praise,
And teach the Sons of men thy ways.
THE DAY OF DOOM.
(1)
STill was the night, Serene and Bright, The Security of the W^^ld before
Christ's coming to Judgment Luke 12.19.

when all Men sleeping lay;
Calm was the season, and carnal reason
thought so 'twould last for ay.
Soul, take thine ease, let sorrow cease,
much good thou have in store:
This was their Song, their Cups among,
the Evening before.
(2)
Wallowing in all kind of sin,
vile wretches lay secure:
The best of men had scarcely then
their Lamps kept in good ure. Mat. 25.5.

Virgins unwise, who through disguise
amongst the best were numbered,
Had closed their eyes; yea, and the wise
through sloth and frailty slumber'd.
(3)
Like as of Gold, when Men grow bold
Gods' threatenings to contemn,
Who stopped their Ear, and would not hear, Mat. 24* 37, 38*

when Mercy warned them:
But took their course, without remorse,
till God began to power
Destruction the World upon
in a tempestuous shower.
(4)
They put away the evil day,
And drowned their care and fears,
Till drowned were they, and swept away
by vengeance unawares:
1 These. 5 3.
So at the last, whilst Men sleep fast
in their security,
Surpised they are in such a snare
as comes suddenly.
(5)
The Suddenness, Majesty, and Terror of Christ's appearing Mat 25.6.
For at midnight brake forth a Light,
which turned the night to day,
And speedily an hideous cry
did all the world dismay.
Sinners' awake, their hearts do ache,
trembling their loins surprizeth;
Amazed with fear, by what they hear,
2 Pet. 3.10
each one of them arises.
(6)
They cush from Beds with giddy heads,
and to their windows run,
Viewing this light, which shines more brigh^
Mat 24.29, 30.
then does the Noonday Sun.
Straightway appears [they see it with tear^
the Son of God most dread;
Who with his Train comes on amain
to Judge both Quick and Dead.
(7)
Before his face the Heavens gave place,
2 Pet. 3.10.
and Skies are ^ent asunder,
With mighty voice, and hideous noise,
more terrible than Thunder.
His brightness damps heavens glorious lam^
and makes them hide their heads
As if afraid and quite dismayed,
they quit their wonted steads.
(8)
Ye sons of men that durst contemn
the Threatenings of Gods Word.
How cheer you now? your hearts, I trow,
are thrilled as with a sword.
Now Atheist blind, whose brutish mind
a God could never see,
Do thou perceive, do now believe
that Christ thy Judge shall be?
(9)
Stout Courages, [whose hardiness
could Death and Hell out-face]
Are you as bold now you behold
your Judge draw near apace?
They cry, no, no: Alas! and woe!
our Courage all is gone:
Our hardiness [fool hardiness]
has us undone, undone.
(10)
No heart so bold, but now grows cold
and almost dead with fear:
No eye so dry, but now can cry,
and pour out many a tear. Rev. 6.16.

Earths Potentates and powerful States,
Captains and Men of Might
Are quite abasht, their courage dashed
at this most dreadful sight.
(11)
Mean men lament, great men do rent
their Robes, and tear their hair:
They do not spare their flesh to tear
through horrible despair. Mat 24.30.

All Kindred wail: all hearts do fail:
horror the world does fill
With weeping eyes, and loud outcries,
yet knows not how to kill.
(12)
Rev 6.15, 16
Some hide themselves in Caves and Delves
in places under ground:
Some rashly leap into the Deap,
to escape by being drowned:
Some to the Rocks [O senseless blocks!]
and woody Mountains run,
That there they might this fearful sight,
and dreaded Presence shun.
(13)
In vain do they to Mountains say,
Fall on us, and us hide
From Judges ire, more hot than fire,
for who may it abide?
No hiding place can from his Face,
sinners at all conceal,
Whose flaming Eyes hid things does 'spy,
and darkest things reveal.
(14)
The Judge draws nigh, exalted high
Mat 25.31.
upon a lofty Throne,
Amidst the throng of Angels strong,
lo, Israel's Holy One!
The excellence of whose presence
and awful Majesty,
Amazeth Nature, and every Creature,
does more than terrify.
(15)
Rev. 6.14.
The Mountains smoke, the Hills are shoo^
the Earth is rent and tor^,
As if she should be clean dissolved,
or from the Center born.
The Sea does roar, forsakes the shore,
and shrinks away for fear;
The wild Beasts flee into the Sea,
so soon as he draws near.
(16)
Whose Glory bright, whose wondrous might
whose Power Imperial,
So far surpass whatever was
in Realms Terrestrial;
That tongues of men [nor Angels pen]
cannot the same express,
And therefore I must pass it by,
lest speaking should transgress.
(17)
Before his Throne a Trump is blown, 1 These. 4.16 Resurrection of the Dead John
5.28, 29*

Proclaiming the Day of Doom:
Forthwith he cries, Ye Dead arise,
and unto Judgment come.
No sooner said, but it is obeyed;
Sepulchers opened are:
Dead Bodies all rise at his call,
and's mighty power declare.
(18)
Both Sea and Land, at his Command,
their Dead at once surrender:
The Fire and Air constrained are
also their dead to tender.
The mighty word of this great Lord
links Body and Soul together
Both of the Just, and the unjust,
to part no more for ever.
(19)
The same translates, The living Changed.
from Mortal states
to Immortality,
All that survive, and be alive,
in the twinkling of an eye: Luke 20.36. 1 Cor. 15.52.

That so they may abide for ay
to endless weal or woe;
Both the Renate and Reprobate
are made to die no more.
(20)
all brought to Judgment. Mat 24.31.
His winged Hosts fly through all Coasts,
together gathering
Both good and bad, both quick and dead,
and all to Judgment bring.
Out of their holes those creeping Moles,
that hid themselves for fear,
By force they take, and quickly make
before the Judge appear.
(21)
2 Cor. 5 10 The Sheep separated from the Goats. Mat. 25.32.
Thus every one before the Throne
of Christ the Judge is brought,
Both righteous and impious
that good or ill had wrought.
A separation, and differing station
by Christ appointed is
[To sinners sad] 'twixt good and bad,
'twixt Heirs of woe and bliss.
(22)
At Christ's right hand the Sheep do stand,
Who are Christ's Sheep. Mat. 5.10, 11.
his holy Martyrs, who
For his dear Name suffering shame,
calamity and woe.
Like Champions stood, and with their Blood
their testimony sealed;
Whose innocence without offense,
to Christ their Judge appealed.
(23)
Next unto whom there find a room
Heb. 12.5, 6, 7.
all Christ's afflicted ones,
Who being chastised, neither despised
nor sa^k amidst their groans:
Who by the Rod were turned to God,
and loved him the more.
Not murmuring nor quarrelling
when they were chast'ned sore.
(24)
Moreover, such as loved much, Luk^ 7.41, 47.

that had not such a trial,
As might constrain to so great pain,
and such deep self denial:
Yet ready were the Cross to bear,
when Christ them called thereto,
And did rejoice to hear his voice,
they are counted Sheep also.
(25)
Christ's Flock of Lambs there also stands, J^h. 21.15 Mat 19.14. Joh. 3.3.

whose Faith was weak, yet true;
All sound Believers [Gospel receiver^]
whose Grace was small, but grew:
And them among an Infant throng
of Babes, for whom Christ died;
Whom for his own, by ways unknown
to men, he sanctified.
(26)
All stand before their Savior
in long white Robes yclad, Rev. 6.11. Phil 3.21

Their countenance full of pleasance,
appearing wondrous glad.
O glorious sight! Behold how bright
dust heaps are made to shine,
Conformed so their Lord unto,
whose Glory is Divine. The Goats described or the several sorts of Reprobates
on the left hand. Mat. 24.51.

(27)
At Christ's left hand the Goats do stand,
all whining hypocrites,
Who for self ends did seem Christ's friends,
but fostered guileful sprites:
Who Sheep resembled, but they dissembled
(their hearts were not sincere)
Who once did throng Christ's Lambs among
but now must not come near.
(28)
Luk 11 24, 26 Heb 6 4, 5, 6. Heb. 10.29
Apostates and Run-awayes,
such as have Christ forsaken,
Of whom the Devil, with seven more evil,
has fresh possession taken:
Sinners in grain, reserved to pain
and torments most severe.
Because against light they sinned with spite*
are also placed there.
(29)
There also stand a numerous band,
that no Profession made
Luk 12.47. Prove. 1.24, 26. Joh 3.19.
Of Godliness, nor to redress
their ways at all essayed:
Who better knew, but [sinful Crew]
Gospel and Law despised;
Who all Christ's knocks withstood like blocks
and would not be advised
(30)
Moreover, there with them appear
a number, numberless
Gal 3.10. 1 Cor 6 9. Rev. 21.8.
Of great and small, vile wretches all,
that did Gods Law transgress:
Idolaters, false worshippers,
Prophaners of Gods Name,
Who not at all thereon did call,
or took in vain the same.
(31)
Blasphemers lewd, and Swearers shrewd,
Scoffers at Purity,
Exodus 20.7. and 8.
That hated God, contemned his Rod,
and loved Security.
Sabbath-polluters, Saints persecuters,
Presumptuous men and Proud,
2 These 1.6, 8, 9.
Who never loved those that reproved;
all stand amongst this Crowd.
(32)
Adult^rers and Whoremongers
where there, with all unchaste: Heb. 13.4. 1 Cor. 6.10

There Covetous, and Ravenous,
that Riches got too fast:
Who used vile ways themselves to raise
to Estates and worldly wealth,
Oppression by, or Knavery,
by force, or fraud, or stealth.
(33)
Moreover, there together were
Children flagitious, Zach. 5.3, 4. Gal 5.19 20, 21.

And Parents who did them undo
by Nurture vicious.
False-witness-bearers, and self-forswearers,
Murd'rers, and Men of blood,
Witches, Inchanters, and Ale house-haunters,
beyond account there stood.
(34)
Their place there find all Heathen blind,
that Natures light abused, Rom 2 13

Although they had no tidings glad
of Gospel Grace refused.
There stands all Nations and Generations esteemed not
of Adam's Progeny,
Whom Christ redeemed not, who Christ
through Infidelity.
(35)
Who no Peacemaker, no Undertaker, Act. 4.12

to shrowed them from Gods ire
Ever obtained; they must be pained
with everlasting fire.
These numerous bands wringing their hands,
and weeping all stand there,
Filled with anguish, whose hearts do languish
through self-tormenting fear.
(36)
Fast by them stand at Christ's left hand
the Lion fierce and fell,
The Dragon bold, that Serpen^ ^^ld.
that hurried Souls to Hell.
1 Cor. 6 3.
There also stand; under comman^
Legions of Sprights unclean,
And hellish Fiends, that are no friends
to God, nor unto Men.
(37)
With dismal chains, and strongest reins,
like Prisoners of Hell,
Jude 6.^
They Are held in place before Christ's face,
till He their Doom shall tell.
These void of tears, but filled with fears,
and dreadful expectation
Of endless pains, and scalding flames,
stand waiting for Damnation.
(38)
All silence keep both Goats and Sheep
before the Judge's Throne:
The Saints ^^eared and justified. (...)
With mild aspect to his Elect
then spoke the Holy One;
My Sheep draw near, your Sentence hear,
which is to you no dread,
Who clearly now discern, and know
your sins are pardoned.
(39)
2 Cor. 5.^0. Eccles 3.^7. Joh 3.18.
'Twas meet that ye should judged be,
that so the world may spy
No cause of grudge, when as I Judge
and deal impartially,
Know therefore all, both great and small,
the ground and reason why
These Men do stand at my right hand,
and look so cheerfully.
(40)
These Men be those my Father chose
before the worlds foundation, Joh 17.6. Ephesians. 14.

And to me gave, that I should save
from Death and Condemnation.
For whose dear sake I flesh did take,
was of a Woman born.
And did inure my self to endure,
unjust reproach and scorn.
(41)
For them it was that I did pass
through sorrows many one:
That I drank up that bitter Cup,
which made me sigh and groan. Rev. 1.5.

The Cross his pain I did sustain;
yea more, my Fathers ire
I underwent, my Blood I spent
to save them from Hell fire.
(42)
Thus I esteemed, thus I redeemed
all these from every Nation,
That they may be (as now you see)
a chosen Generation.
What if ere-while they were as vile,
and bad as any be, Ephesians. 2.1, 3*

And yet from all their guilt and thrall
at once I set them free?
(43)
My grace to one is wrong to none: Mat. 20.13, 15. Romans 9.20, 21.

none can Election claim
Amongst all those their souls that lose,
none can Rejection blame.
He that may choose, or else refuse,
all men to save or spill,
May this Man choose, and that refuse,
redeeming whom he will.
(44)
But as for those whom I have chose
Isa. 53.4, 5, 11.
Salvations heirs to be,
I underwent their punishment,
and therefore set them free,
I bore their grief, and their relief
by suffering procured,
That they of bliss and happiness
might firmly be assured.
(45)
Acts 13.48. Jam. 2.18 Heb. 12.7 Mat. 19.29.
And this my grace they did embrace,
believing on my Name;
Which Faith was true, the fruits do show
proceeding from the same:
Their Penitence, their Patience,
their Love and Self-denial
In suffering losses, and bearing Crosses,
when put upon the trial.
(46)
Their sin forsaking, their cheerful taking
1 John 3 3 Mat. 25.39, 40.
my yoke, their Charity
Unto the Saints in all their wants,
and in them unto me.
These things do clear, and make appear
their Faith to be unfaigned.
And that a part in my desert
and purchase they have gained.
(47)
Their debts are paid, their peace is made,
Isa. 53.11, 12 Romans 8.16, 17, 33, 34. John 3 ^8.
their sins remitted are;
Therefore at once I do pronounce,
and openly declare;
That Heaven is thei^^, that they be Heirs
of Life and of Salvation!
Nor ever shall th^^ come at all
to Death or to Damnation.
(48)
Come, Blessed Ones, and sit on Thrones, Luke 22.29, 30. Mat. 19.28.

Judging the World with me:
Come, and possess your happiness,
and bought felicity.
Henceforth no fears, no care, no tears,
no sin shall you annoy,
Nor any thing that grief does bring.
E^ernal Rest enjoy.
(49)
You bore the Cross, Mat. 25.34. They are placed on Thrones to join with Christ
in judging the wicked.
you suffered loss
of all for my Names sake:
Receive the Crown that is now your own;
come, and a Kingdom take.
Thus spoke the Judge, the wicked grudge,
and grind their teeth in vain;
They see with groans these placed on Thrones
which adds to their pain:
(50)
That those whom they did wrong and slay,
must now their judgment see!
Such whom they slighted, and once despighted,
must now their Judges be!
Thus it is decreed, such is their meed,
and guerdon glorious? 1 Cor. 6.2.

With Christ they si^, Judging is fit
to plague the Impious.
(51)
The wicked are brought to the Bar, The wicked brought to the Bar. Romans 2.3, 6,
11.

like guilty Malefactors,
That oftentimes of bloody Crimes
and Treasons have been Actors.
Of wicked Men, none are so mean
as there to be neglected:
Nor none so high in dignity,
as there to be respected.
(52)
Rev 6 15, 16. Isa 30.33.
The glorious Judge will privilege
nor Emperor, nor King:
But every one that has mis-done
does into Judgment bring.
And every one that has mis-done,
the Judge impartially
Condemns to eternal woe,
and endless misery.
(53)
Thus one and all, thus great and small
the Rich as well as Poor,
And those of place as the most base,
do stand the Judge before.
They are arraigned, and there detained,
before Christ's Judgment Seat
With trembling fear, their Doom to hear,
and feel his angers heat.
(54)
There Christ demands at all their hands
Eccles. 11 9 and 12 14.
a strict and strait account
Of all things done under the Sun,
whose number far surmount
Man's wit and thought: yet all are brought
unto this solemn Trial;
And each off^nce with evidence,
so that there is no denial.
(55)
There Is no excuses for their abuses,
since their own Consciences
More proof give in of each Man's sin,
than thousand Witnesses,
Though formerly this faculty
had grossly been abused,
Men could it stifle, or with it trifle,
when as it them accused,
(56)
Now it comes in, and every sin
unto M^ns charge does lay:
It judges them, and does condemn,
though all the world say nay.
It so stingeth and tortureth,
it works such distress,
That each Man's self against himself,
is forced to confess.
(57)
It Is vain, moreover, Secret sins and works of darkness brought to light. Psalm
(...). 2, 4 (...). Romans 2.16.
for Men to cover
the least iniquity:
The Judge has seen, and privy been
to all their villainy.
He unto light, and open sight
the works of darkness brings:
He does unfold both new and old,
both known and hidden things.
(58)
All filthy facts, and secret acts,
however closly done, Eccles 12 14.

And long concealed, are there revealed
before the midday Sun.
Deeds of the night shunning the light,
which darkest corners sought,
To fearful blam^, and endless shame,
are there most justly brought.
(59)
And as all facts and gr^sser acts, Mat. 12.36. Romans 77.

so every word and thought,
Erroneous notion, and lustful motion,
are unto judgment brought.
No sin so small and trivial.
but hither it must come:
Nor so long past, but now at last
it must receive a doom.
(60)
An account demanded of all their actions. Joh. 5.40 and 3 19. Mat 25.19, 27.
At this sad season, Christ asks a Reason
(with just Austerity)
Of Grace refused, of light abused
so often, so wilfully:
OF Tslents lent by them misspent,
and on their Lust bestown;
Which if improved, as it behooved,
Heaven might have been their own.
(61)
Of times neglected, of means rejected,
of God's long-suffering,
Romans 2.4, 5.
And Patience, to Penitence
that sought hard hearts to bring.
Why Cords of love did nothing move
to shame or to remorse?
Why warnings grave, and counsels, have
naught changed their sinful course?
(62)
Why chastenings, and evil things,
why judgments so severe
Isa. 1.5.
Prevailed not with them a jot,
nor wrought an awful fear?
Jer. 2.20
Why Promises of Holiness,
and new Obedience,
They often did make, but always brake
the same, to God's offense?
(63)
Why still Hell-ward, John 3 19, 20 Prove 8.36 Luk 12.20, 21.
without regard,
they boldly ventured,
And chose Damnation before Salvation,
when it was offered:
Why sinful pleasures, and earthly treasures,
like fools, they prized more
Than heavenly wealth, Eternal health,
and all Christ's Royal store.
(64)
Why, Luke 13.34. J^h 5.40 and 15 22
when he stood ^ff'ring his Blood
to wash them from their sin,
They would embrace no saving Grace,
but lived and died therein?
Such aggravations, wh^^ no ^vasions,
nor false pretenses hold,
Exaggerate and ^cumulate
guilt more than can be told.
(65)
They multiply and m^gnify
men's gr^ss iniquities
They draw down wrath (as Scripture says)
out of Gods treasuries
Thus all their wa^^ Christ open lays
to men and Angels view,
And, as they were, makes them appear
in their own proper hew.
(66)
Thus he does find of all Mankind,
that stand at his left hand. Romans 3.10, 12.

No Mothers Son, but has mis done,
and broken God's Command.
All have transgrest, even the best,
and merited God's wrath
Unto their own perdition,
and everlasting s^ath.
(67)
Earths dwellers al, both great and small,
have wrought iniquity, Rom 6.23.

And suffer must, for it is just,
Eternal misery
Amongst the many there come not any,
before the Judge's face,
That able are themselves to clear,
of all this cursed race.
(68)
Nevertheless, they all express,
Christ granting liberty,
What for their way they have to say,
how they have lived, and why.
Hypocrites plead for themselves
They all draw near, and se^k to clear
themselves by making pleas.
There Hypocrites, false-hearted wights,
do make such pleas as these.
(69)
Lord, in thy Name, and by the same
we Devils di^^oss^st.
We raised the dead, and ministered
Mat 7.21 22, 23
succor to the distressed.
Our painful teaching, and powerful preaching
by thine own wondrous might,
Did thoroughly win to God from sin
many a wretched wight.
(70)
The judge rep^yeth. J^h 6.70 1 Cor. 9.27
All this, quoth he, may granted be,
and your case little bettered,
Who still remain under a chain,
and many irons fettered.
You that the dead have quickened,
and rescued from the grave,
Your selves were dead, yet never n^d,
a Christ your Souls to save.
(71)
You that could preach, and others teach
Romans 2, 19, 2^, 22, 23.
what way to life does lead;
Why were you sl^ck to find that track,
and in that way to tread?
How could you bear to see or hear
of others freed at last.
From Satan's paws, whilst in his jaws
your selves were held more fast?
(72)
Who though you knew Repentance true, Joh 9 41

and Faith in my great Name,
The only mean to quit you clean,
from punishment and bl^m^,
Yet took no pain true Faith to gain, Rev. 2.21, 22.

such as might not deceive,

your evil deeds to leave.

Yet left undone his duty known, Luke 12.47. Mat. 11.21, 2^^ 24.

wherefore it shall be now
For Sidon and for Sodoms Land

(74)
But we have in thy presence been, Another plea of hypocrites. Luk 13.26.

say some, and eaten there.
Did we not eat thy Flesh for meat,
and feed on heavenly Cheer?
Whereon who feed shall never n^^d,
as thou thy self do say,
Nor shall they die eternally,
but live with Christ for ay.
(75)
We may allege, thou gav'st a pledge
of thy dear love to us
In Wine and Bread, which figured
thy Grace bestowed thus.
Of strengthening Seals, of sweetest Meals,
have we so often partaken;
And shall we be cast off by thee,
and utterly forsaken?
(76)
Is Answered. Luk 13 27 Mat 22.12.
To whom the Lord t^us in a word
returns a short reply,
I never knew any of you
that wr^ught iniquity
You say you have been my Presence in;
but friends, how came you there
With Raiment vile that did defile
and quite disgrace my Cheer?
(77)
Durst you draw near without due fear
unto my holy Table?
Durst you profane, and render vain
so far as you were able,
Those Mysteries? which whosoever prize
and carefully improve,
Shall saved be undoubtedly,
and nothing shall them move.
(78)
How durst you venture, bold guests, to enter
in such a sordid hew,
1 Cor 11* 27, 29.
Amongst my guests, unto those Feasts
that were not made for you?
How durst you eat for spiritual meat
your bane, and drink damnation,
Whilst by your guile you rendered vile
so rare and great Salvation?
(79)
Your ^ancies fed on heavenly Bread,
Mat. 6.21, 24 R^m. 1.25
your hearts led on some Lust:
You loved the Creature more than the Creator,
your S^uls clave to the dust.
And think you by Hypocrisy,
and c^oaked Wickedness,
To enter in, laden with sin,
to lasting happiness?
(80)
This your excuse shows your abuse
of things ordained for good; 1 Cor 11.27, 29.

And does declare you guilty are
of my dear Flesh and Blood.
Wherefore those Seals and precious Meals
you put so much upon
As things divine, they seal and sign
you to Perdition.
(81)
Then forth issue another Crew
(those being silenced)
Who drawing nigh to the most High
adventure thus to plead: Another sort of hyp^rites make their pleas.

We sinners were, say they, it is clear;
deserving Condemnation:
But did not we rely on thee,
O Christ, for whole Salvation?
(82)
We did believe, and often receive
thy gracious promises:
We took great care to get a share
in endless happiness. Act 8.13, Isa 58.2, 3. Heb. 6 4, 5.

We prayed and wept, we Fast-dayes kept,
lewd ways we did eschew:
We joyful were thy Word to hear;
we formed our lives anew.
(83)
We thought our sin had pard'ned been;
that our Estate was good,
Our debts all paid, our peace well made,
our Souls washed with thy Blood.
Lord, why do thou reject us now, 2 Pet. 2.20.

who have not thee rejected,
Nor utterly true sanctity
and holy life neglected*
(84)
The Judge uncaseth them.
The Judge incensed at their pretenced
self-vanting Piety,
With such a look as trembling struck
John 2.24, 25.
into them, made reply;
O impud^^^, impenitent,
and guileful generation!
Think you that I cannot descry
your hearts abomination?
(85)
You nor received, nor yet believed
Joh. 6.64
my Promises of Grace;
Nor were you wise enough to prize
Psalm 50.16* Mat. 15.26.
my reconciled Face:
But did presume that to assume
which was not yours to take,
And challenged the Childrens bread,
yet would not sin forsake.
(86)
Being too bold you laid fast hold,
Rev. 3.17
where interest you had none,
Your selves deceiving by your believing,
all which you might have known,
Mat. 13.20.
You ran away, but ran astray,
with Gospel-promises,
And per^shed; being still dead
in sins and trespasses.
(87)
How often did I Hypocrisy
and Hearts deceit unmask
Mat. 6.2 4, 24. Jer. 8 5 6, 7, 8.
Before your fight, giving you light
to know a Christians task?
But you held fast unto the last
your own Conceits so vain*
No warning could prevail, you would
your own Deceits retain.
(88)
As for your care to get a share
in bliss; the fear of Hell, Psalm. 78.34, 55, 36, 37.

And of a part in endless smart,
did thereunto compel.
Your holiness and ways redress,
such as it was, did spring
From no true love to things above,
but from some other thing.
(89)
You prayed and wept, you Fast-days kept; Zach. 7.5, 6 Isa 58.3, 4 1 Samuel 15 13,
21. Isaiah 1.11, 15.

but did you this to me?
No, but for sin, you s^^ght to win,
the greater liberty.
For all your vaunts, you had vile haunts,
for which your Consciences
Did you alarm, whose voice to charm
you used these practices.
(90)
Your Penitence, your diligence
to Read, to Pray, to Hear, Mat. 6.2, 5 John 5.44.

Were but to drowned the clamorous sound
of Conscience in your ear.
If light you loved, vainglory moved
your selves therewith to store,
That seeming wise, men might you prize,
and honor you the more.
(91)
Thus from your selves unto your selves,
your duties all do tend:
And as self-love the wheels does move, Zach. 7.5, 6. H^s. 10.1.

so in self-love they end
Thus Christ detects their vain projects,
and close Impiety,
And plainly shows that all their shows
were but Hypocrisy.
(92)
Civil honest men's pleas. Luk 18.11.
Then were brought high a Company
of Civil honest Men,
That loved true dealing, and hated stealing
never wronged their Brethren;
Who pleaded thus, Thou know us
that we were blameless livers;
No Whoremongers, no Murderers,
no quarrellers nor strivers.
(93)
Idolaters, Adulterers,
Church-robbers we were none,
Nor false-dealers, no couzeners,
but paid each man his own.
Our way was fair, our dealing square,
we were no wastful spenders,
No lewd toss pots, no drunken sots,
no scandalous offenders.
(94)
We hated vice, and set great price,
by virtuous conversation:
And by the same we got a name,
and no small commendation.
1 Samuel 15.22.
Gods Laws express that righteousness,
is that which he does prize;
And to obey, as he does say,
is more than sacrifice.
(95)
Thus to obey, has been our way,
let our good deeds we pray,
Find some regard, and some reward
with thee, O Lord, this day.
Eccles. 7.20.
And whereas we transgressors be,
of Adam's Race were none,
No not the best, but have confessed
themselves to have mis-done.
(96)
Then answered unto their dread, Are taken off and rendered inva^id. Deuteronomy 10.12.
Tit 2 12 Jam. 2.10

the Judge: True Piety
God does desire and eke require
no less than honesty.
Justice demands at all your hands
perfect Obedience:
If but in part you have come short,
that is a just offense.
(97)
On Earth below, where men did ow
a thousand pounds and more,
Could twenty pence it recompense?
could that have cleared the score?
Think you to buy felicity
with part of what is due debt?
Or for desert of one small part,
the whole should off be set.
(98)
And yet that part, whose great desert
you think to reach so far
For your excuse, does you accuse, Luke 18.11, 14,

and will your boasting mar.
However fair, howeve^ square
your way and work has been,
Before men's eyes, yet God espies
iniquity therein.
(99)
God looks upon the affection
and temper of the heart; 1 Samuel 16 7. 2 Chronicles. 25.2.

Not only on the action,
and the external part.
Whatever and vain men pretend,
God knows the verity;
And by the end which they intend
their words and deeds does try.
(100)
Heb. 11.6
Without true Faith, the Scripture says
God cannot take delight
In any deed, that does proceed
from any sinful wight.
And without love all actions prove
1 Cor. 13 1, 2, 3.
but barren empty things.
Dead works they be, and vanity,
the which vexation brings.
(101)
Nor from true faith, which quenches wrath
has your obedience flown:
Nor from true love, which wont to move
Believers has it grown.
Your argument shows your intent,
in all that you have done:
You thought to scale Heavens lofty Wall
by Ladders of your own.
(102)
Rom 10.3.
Your blinded spirit, hoping to merit
by your own Righteousness,
Needed no Savior, but your behavior,
and blameless carriages
You trusted to what you could do,
and in no need you stood:
Your haughty pride laid me aside,
and trampled on my Blood.
(103)
All men have gone astray, and done,
that which Gods Laws condemn:
But my Purchase and offered Grace
all men did not contemn
Romans 9.30, 32. Mat. 1^.23, 24. and 12.41
The Niuevites, and Sodomites,
had no such sin as this:
Yet as if all your sins were small,
you say, All did amiss.
(104)
Again you thought and mainly sought
a name with men to acquire. Mat. 6 5.

Pride bare the Bell, that made you swell,
and your own selves admire.
Mean fruit it is, and vile, I wiss,
that springs from such a root:
Virtue divine and genuine
wonts not from pride to shoot.
(105)
Such deeds as your are worse than poor;
they are but sins guilt over
With silver dross, Prove 26 23. Mat 23.27.
whose glistering gloss
can them no longer cover.
The best of them would you condemn,
and ruin you alone,
Although you were from faults so clear,
that other you had none.
(106)
Your Gold is brass, your silver dross,
your righteousness is sin:
And think you by such honesty
eternal life to win? Prove. 15.8. Romans 3.20.

You much mistake, if for its sake
you dream of acceptance;
Whereas the same deserves shame,
and meriteth Damnation.
(107)
A wondrous Crowd then 'gan aloud, Those that pretend want of opportunity to
repent. Pro 27.1. Jam 4 13

thus for themselves to say,
We did intend, Lord to amend,
and to reform our way:
Our true intent was to repent,
and make our peace with thee;
But sudden death stopping our breath,
left us no liberty.
(108)
Short was our time, for in his prime
our youthful flower was cropped:
We died in youth, before full growth,
so was our purpose stopped.
Let our good will to turn from ill,
and sin to have forsaken.
Accepted be, O Lord, by thee,
and in good part be taken.
(109)
Are Confuted and Convinced Eccles. 12 1. Rev. 2.21.
To whom the Judge, where you allege
the shortness of the space,
That from your birth you lived on earth,
to compass saving Grace:
It was Free grace that any space
was given you at all
To turn from evil, defy the Devil,
and upon God to call.
(110)
Luke 13.24. 2 Cor. 6.2. Heb. 3.7, 8, 9.
One day, one week, wherein to seek
God's face with all your hearts,
A favor was that far did pass
the best of your deserts.
You had a season, what was your reason
such precious hours to waste?
What could you find, what could you mind
that was of greater haste?
(111)
Could you find time for vain pastime,
for loose licentious mirth?
Eccles 11.9. Luk 14.18, 19.20.
For fruitless toys, and fading joys
that perish in the birth?
Had you good leisure for carnal Pleasure,
in days of health and youth?
And yet no space to seek God's face,
and turn to him in truth?
(112)
In younger years, beyond your fears, Amos 6.3. to 6.

what if you were surprised?
You put away the evil day,
and of long life devised. Ephesians. 5.16 Luke 19.42,

You often were told, and might behold,
that Death no Age does spare;
Why then did you your time foreslow,
and slight your Souls welfare?
(113)
Had your intent been to repent,
and had you it desired,
There would have been endeavors seen, Luk 13.24, 25, etc. Phil 2.12

before your time expired*
God makes no treasure, nor has he pleasure
in idle purposes:
Such fair pretenses are foul offenses,
and cloaks for wickedness,
(114)
Then were brought in, and charged with sin,
another Company,
Who by Petition obtained permission, Some plead Examples of their b^tters. Mat
18 7.

to make Apology:
They argued, We were misled,
as is well known to thee,
By their Example, that had more ample
abilities than we:
(115)
Such as professed they did detest,
and hate each wicked way: John 7.48.

Whose seeming grace whilst we did trace,
our Souls were led astray.
When men of Parts, Learning and Arts,
Professing Piety,
Did thus and thus, it seemed to us
we might take liberty.
(116)
Who are told that Examples are no Rules. Psalm. 19.8.11. Ex^ ^3.2. Psalm. 50.17,
18.
The Judge replies, I gave you eyes,
and light to see your way,
Which had you lo^'d, and well improved
you had not gone astray.
My Word was pure, the Rule was sure,
why did you it forsake,
Or thereon trample, and men's example,
your Directory make?
(117)
This you well knew, that God is true
2 Timothy 3 5.
and that most men are liars,
In word professing holiness,
in deed thereof deniers.
O simple fools! that having Rules
your lives to regulate,
Would them refuse, and rather choose
vile men to imitate.
(118)
They urge that they were misled by godly men's Examples But all their shifts
turn to their greater shame. 1 Cor 11.1 Phil. 4.8.
But Lord, say they, we went astray,
and did more wickedlie,
By means of those whom thou have chose
Salvation heirs to be.
To whom the Judge; What you allege,
does nothing help the case;
But makes appear how vile you were.
and rend'reth you more base.
(119)
You understood that what was good,
was to be followed,
And that you ought that which was naugh^
to have relinquished.
Contrariwayes, it was your guise,
only to imitate
Good men's defects, and their neglects
that were regenerate.
(120)
But to express their holiness,
or imitate their grace, Psalm. 32.5. 2 Chro. 32.26, Mat 26.^5 Prove. 1.24, 25.
Some plead the Scriptures darkness. And difference amongst Interpreters. 2 Pet.
3.16. They are confuted. Pro 14* 6. Isa ^5.8. Hos. ^.12

You little cared, nor once prepared
your hearts to seek my face
They did repent, and truly rent
their hearts for all known sin:
You did offend, but not amend,
to follow them therein.
(121)
We had thy Word, say some, O Lord,
but wiser men than we
Could never yet interpret it,
but always disagree.
How could we foo^s be led by Rules,
so far beyond our ken,
Which to explain did so much pain,
and puzzle wisest men.
(122)
Was all my word abstruse and hard?
the Judge then answered:
I did contain much truth so plain,
you ^ight have run and read.
(...) what was hard you never cared
to know nor studied.
And things that were most plain and clear
you never practiced.
(123)
The Mystery of Piety
God unto Babes reveals; Mat. 11.25.

When (...) the wise he it denies,
and from the world conceals. Prove. 2.3, 4, 5.

If to (...) Gods holy will
had seemed good to you
You would have sought light as you ought,
and done the good you knew.
(124)
Others the fear of Persecution. Acts 28.22.
Then came in view another Crew,
and 'gan to make their pleas
Amongst the rest, some of the best
had such poor shifts as these:
Thou know right well, who all can tell
we lived amongst thy foes,
Who the Renate did sorely hate,
and goodness much oppose.
(125)
We holiness durst not profess,
John 12.42, 43
fearing to be forlorn
Of all our friends, and for amends
to be the wickeds scorn.
We knew their anger would much endanger
our lives, and our estates:
Therefore for fear we dust appear
no better than our mates.
(126)
They are answered. Luk 12.4, 5. Isa. 51.12, 13.
To whom the Lord returns this word;
O wonderful deceits!
To cast off aw of Gods strict Law,
and fear men's wrath and threats.
To fear hellfire and Gods fierce ire
less than the rage of men.
As it Gods wrath, could do less scath
than wrath of brethren.
(127)
To use such strife, a temporal life,
to rescue and secure,
And be so blind as not to mind
that life that will endure.
This was your case, who carnal peace
more than true joys did savor;
Who fed on dust, clave to your lust,
and spurned at my favor*
(128)
To please your kin, men's love to win, Luke 9 23, 24, 25. Chap. 16.25.

to flow in worldly wealth,
To save your ^kin, these ^ings have bin
more than Eternal health.
You had your choice, wherein rejoice,
it was your portion,
For which you chose your Souls t'expose
unto perdition.
(129)
Who did not hate friends, life and state
with all things else for me. Luke 9.26. Prove. 8.36. John 3.19, 20.

And all forsake, and Cross up-take,
shall never happy be.
Well worthy they to dye for ay,
who death then ^e had rather.
Death is their due, that so value
the friendship of m^ Father.
(130)
Others Argue, and not a few, Others plead for Pardon both from Gods mercy and
justice. Psalm. 78.38 2 Kings 14* 26.

is not God gracious?
His Equity and Clemency
are they not mavelous?
Thus we believed; are we deceived?
cannot his mercy great,
(As has been told to us of old)
assuage his angers heat?
(131)
How can it be that God should see
his Creatures endless pain,
Or hear the groans and rueful moans,
and still his wr^th retain?
Can it agree with Equity?
can mercy have the heart
To recompense few years offense
with Everlasting smart?
(132)
Can God delight in such a sight
as sinners misery?
Or what great good can this our blood
bring unto the most High?
Psalm. 30.9. Mic 7.18
Oh, thou that do thy Glory most
in pard'ning sin display!
Lord, might it please thee to release,
and pardon us this day?
(133)
Unto thy Name more glorious fame
would not such mercy bring?
Would not it raise thine endless praise,
more than our suffering?
With that they cease, holding their peace,
but cease not still to weep;
Grief ministers a flood of tears,
in which their words do steep.
(134)
But all too late, grief's out of date,
when life is at an end.
The glorious King thus answering,
all to his voice attend:
They answered.
God gracious is, quoth he, like his
no mercy can be found;
His Equity and Clemency
to sinners do abound.
Mercy that now shines forth in the vessels of Mercy. Mic 7 18 Rom 9.23.
(135)
As may appear by those that here
are placed at my right hand;
Whose stripes I bore, and cleared the score,
that they might quitted stand.
For surely none, but God alone,
whose Grace transcends men's thought,
For such as those that were his foes
like wonders would have wrought.
(136) Did also long wait upon such as abused it. Romans 2.4* Hos 11 4.

And none but he such lenitee
and patience would have shown
To you so long, who did him wrong,
and pulled his judgments down.
How long a space (O stiff neck'd race)
did patience you afford?
How often did love you gently move,
to turn unto the Lord?
(137)
With Cords of love God often strove
your stubborn hearts to tame: Luk* 13.34 The day of Grace now past.

Nevertheless your wickedness,
did still resist the same.
If now at last Mercy be past
from you for evermore,
And Justice come in Mercies room,
yet grudge you not therefore.
(138)
If into wrath God turned has
his long long suffering, Luke 19.42, 43. Jude 4.

And now for love you vengeance prove,
it is an equal thing.
Your waxing worse, has stopped the course
of wonted Clemency:
Mercy refused, and Grace misused,
call for severity.
(139)
It Is now high time that every Crime
be brought to punishment: Romans 2.5, 6. Isa. 1 24. Am^s 2.13* Genesis 18.25.

Wrath long contained, and often restrained,
at last must have a vent:
Justice severe cannot forbear
to plague sin any longer,
But must inflict with hand most strict
mischief upon the wronger.
(140)
Mat. 25 3. ^1, 12. Prove. 1 28, 29, 30.
In vain do they for Mercy pray,
the season being past,
Who had no care to get a share
therein, while time did last.
The man whose ear refused to hear
the voice of Wisdoms cry,
Earned this reward, that none regard
him in his misery.
(141)
It does agree with equity,
Isa 5 18* 19. Genesis 2.17. Rom 2.8, 9.
and with Gods holy Law,
That those should dye eternally
that death upon them draw,
The Soul that has damnation wi^,
for so the Law ordains;
Which Law is just, and therefore must
such suffer endless pain.
(142)
Rom* 6.23. 2 Thessalonians. 1 8, 9.
Eternal smart is the de^rt,
even of the least off^nce;
Then wonder not (...) allot
to you this Recompense:
But wonder more, that since so sore
and lasting plagues are due
To every sin, you lived therein,
who well the danger knew.
(143)
God has no joy to c^osh or 'stroy,
Ezekiel 33 11. Exodus* 34 7. and 14* 17 Rom 9, 22.
and ruin wretched wights,
But to display the glorious Ray
of Justice he delights.
To ma^i^est be does detest,
and thoroughly hate all sin,
By plaguing it as is most fi^,
this shall him glory win.
(144) Some pretend they were shut out from Heaven by Gods Decree. Romans 9.18,
19.

Then at the Bar arraig^d are
an impudenter fort,
Who to evade the guilt that is laid
upon them, thus retort;
How could we cease thus to transgress?
how could we Hell avoid,
Whom Gods Decree shut out from thee,
and signed to be destroyed?
(145)
Whom God ordains to endless pains,
by Law unalterable,
Repentance true, Obedience new,
to save such are unable:
Sorrow for sin, no good can win, Heb. 22.17. Romans 11.7, 8.

to such as are rejected;
Ne can they grieve, nor yet believe,
that never were elected.
(146)
Of Man's fallen Race, who can true Grace,
or Holiness obtain?
Who can convert or change his heart,
if God withhold the same?
Had we applied our selves, and tried
as much as who did most
God's love to gain, our busy pain
and labor had been lost. Their pleas taken off. Luk 13.27. 2 Pet 1.9 10
compared with* Mat 19.6

(147)
Christ readily makes this Reply,
I damn you not because
You are rejected, or not elected,
but you have broke my Laws:
It is but vain your wits to strain,
the end and means to sever:
Men fondly seek to part or break
what God has linked together.
(148)
Acts 3.19 and 16 31.
Whom God will save, such he will have,
the m^ans of life to use:
Whom he will pass by, shall 1 Samuel 2.15 John 3.19. Joh 5 40. 2 These 2 11, 12.
choose to die,
and ways of life refuse.
He that foresees, and fore decrees,
in wisdom ordered has,
That man's free will electing ill,
shall bring his will to pass.
(149)
Ezekiel. 33.11, 12, 13. Luke 13.34* Prove. 8.33, 36.
High God's Decree, as it is free,
so does it none compel
Against their will to good or ill,
it forces none to Hell.
They have their wish whose Souls perish
with Torments in Hellfire,
Who rather chose their Souls to lose,
than leave a loose desire.
(150)
Genesis 2.17* Mat 25.41, 42. Ezekiel. 18.20.
God did ordain sinners to pain
and I to Hell send none,
But such as swerved, and have deserved
destruction as their own,
His pleasure is, that none from bliss
and endless happiness
Be barred, but such as wronged him much
by wilful wickedness.
(151)
You, sinful Crew, no other knew
but you might be elect.
2 Pet. 1.10 Acts 13 46. Luke 13 24.
Why did you then your selves condemn?
why did you me reject?
Where was your strife to gain that life
which lasts evermore?
You never knocked, yet say God locked
against you Heavens door.
(152)
'Twas no vain task to knock, to ask, Mat. 7.7, 8.

whilst life continued.
Whoever sought heaven as he ought,
and seeking perished? Gal 5.22, 23.

The lowly meek who truly seek
for Christ, and for Salvation,
There Is no Decree whereby such be
ordained to Condemnation.
(153)
You argue then; But abject men,
whom God resolves to spill,
Cannot repent, nor their hearts rent;
ne can they change their will.
Nor for his Can is any man
adjudged unto Hell:
But for his Will to do what is ill, John 3.19.

and nilling to do well.
(154)
I often stood tend'ring my Blood
to wash away your guilt:
And eke my Spright to frame you right,
lest your Souls should be spilt.
But you vile Race, rejected Grace,
when Grace was freely proffered: John 5.40.

No changed heart, no heavenly part
would you, when it was offered.
(155)
Who wilfully the Remedy,
and means of life contemned,
Cause have the same themselves to blame,
if now they be condemned. John 15.22, 24. Heb. 2 3. Isa 66.3, 4

You have your selves, you and none else,
your selves have done to die.
You chose the way to your decay,
and perished wilfully.
(156)
These words appall and daunt them all;
dism^i'd, and all amor^,
Like stocks they stand at Christ's left hand,
and dare no more retort.
Then were brought near with trembling fear,
a number numberless
Of blind Heathen, and brutish men,
that did Gods Laws transgress.
(157)
Heathen men plead want of the written Word.
Whose wicked ways Christ open lays,
and makes their sins appear,
They making pleas their case to ease,
if not themselves to clear.
Thy written Word (say they) good Lord,
we never did enjoy:
We nor refused, nor it abused
Oh, do not us destroy!
(158)
You never abused, nor yet refused
Mat. 11.22. Luke 12.48.
my written Word, you plead,
That Is true (quoth he) therefore shall ye
the less be punished.
You shall not smart for any part
of other men's offense,
But for your own transgression
receive due recompense.
(159)
But we were blind, say they, in mind,
1 Cor. 1.21. And insufficiency of the Light of Nature.
too dim was Natures Light
Out only guide, as has been tried
to bring us to the sight
Of our estate degenerate,
and cursed by Adam's Fall;
How we were born and lay forlorn
in bondage and in thrall*
(160)
We did not know a Christ till now,
nor how fallen man be saved,
Else would we not, right well we wot,
have so our selves behaved.
We should have mourned, we should have turned Mat. 11.21.

from sin at thy Reproof,
And been more wise through thy advice,
for our own Souls behoof.
(161)
But Natures Light shined not so bright
to teach us the right way:
We might have loved it, and well improved it, They are answered.

and yet have gone astray.
The Judge most High makes this Reply,
you ignorance pretend,
Dimness of sight, and want of light
your course Heav'nward to bend.
(162)
How came your mind to be so blind? Gen 1.27 Eccles. 7 29 Hos. 13 9.

I once you knowledge gave,
Clearness of sight, and judgment right;
who did the same deprave?
If to your cost you have it lost,
and quite defaced the same;
Your own desert has caused the smart,
you ought not me to blame.
(163)
Your selves into a pit of woe, Mat 1.25. compard with 20. and 15

your own transgression led;
If I to none my Grace had shown,
who had been injured?
If to a few, and not to you,
I showed a way of life,
My Grace so free, you clearly see,
gives you no ground of strife.
(164)
It Is vain to tell, you wot full well
if you in time had known
Your Misery and Remedy,
your actions had it shown
Romans 1.20, 21, 22.
You, sinful Crew, have not bee^ true
unto the Light of Nature,
Nor done the good you understood*
nor owned your Creator.
(165)
He that the Light, because it is Light,
has used to despize,
Would not the Light shining more bright,
Romans 2.12, 15 and 1 32. Mat 12.41 Reprobate Infants plead for themselves Rev.
20.12, 15. Compared with Romans 5 12, 14. and 9.11, 13. Ezekiel 18.2.
be likely for to prize.
If you had loved, and well improved
your knowledge and dim sight,
Herein your pain had not been vain,
your plagues had been more light.
(166)
Then to the Bar, all they drew near
who died in Infancy,
And never had or good or bad
eff^cted pers'nally,
But from the womb unto the tomb
were straightway carried,
(Or at the last e're they transgrest)
who thus began to plead:
(167)
If for our own transgression,
or disobedience,
We here did stand at thy left hand
just were the Recompense:
But Adam's guilt our souls has spilt,
his fault is charged on us;
And that alone has overthrown,
and utterly undone us.
(168)
Not we, but he ate of the Tree,
whose fruit was interdicted:
Yet on us all of his sad Fall,
the punishment's inflicted.
How could we sin that had not been
or how is his sin our
Without consent* which to prevent,
we never had a power?
(169)
O great Creator, why was our Nature
depraved and forlorn?
Why so defiled, and made so vild
whilst we were yet unborn?
If it be just, and needs we must
transgressors rec^'ned be, Psalm. 51.5.

Thy Mercy, Lord, to us afford,
which sinners has set free.
(170)
Behold we see Adam set free,
and saved from his trespass,
Whose sinful Fall has split us all,
and brought us to this pass
Can thou deny us once to try,
or Grace to us to tender,
When he finds grace before thy face,
that was the chief off^nder?
(171)
Then answered the Judge most dread, Their Argument taken off. Ezekiel. 18 20. Rom
5 12, 19.

God does such doom forbid,
That men should dye eternally
for what they never did.
But what you call old Adam's Fall,
and only his Trespass,
You call amiss to call it his,
both his and yours it was.
(172)
He was defign'd of all Mankind
to be a public Head,
A common Root, whence all should shoot,
and stood in all their stead.
1 Cor. 15.48, 49.
He stood and fell, did ill or well,
not for himself alone,
But for you all, who now his Fall,
and trespass would disown.
(173)
If he had stood, then all his brood
had been established
In Gods true love, never to move,
nor once awry to tread:
Then all his Race, my Father's Grace,
should have enjoyed for ever,
And wicked Sprights by subtle sleights
could them have harmed never.
(174)
Would you have grieved to have received
through Adam so much good,
As had been your for evermore,
if he at first had stood?
Would you have said, we never obeyed,
nor did thy Laws regard;
It ill be fi^s with b^n^fits,
us, Lord, so to reward,
(175)
Since then to share in his welfare,
you could have been content,
You may with reason share in his treason,
and in the punishment.
Romans 5.12. Psa 51.5. Genesis 5.3
Hence you were born in state forlorn,
with Natures so depraved:
Death was your due, because that you
had thus your selves behaved.
(176)
You think if we had been as he, Mat. 23.30, 31.

whom God did so betrust,
We to our cost would never have lost
all for a paltry Lust.
Had you been made in Adam's stead,
you would like things have wrought,
And so into the self-same woe,
your selves and yours have brought.
(177)
I may deny you once to try, Romans 9.15, 1^. The free gift. Romans 5.15.

or Grace to you to tender,
Though he finds Grace before my face,
who was the chief offender:
Else should my Grace cease to be Grace;
for it should not be free,
If to release whom I should please,
I have no libertee.
(178)
If upon one what is due to none
I frankly shall bestow,
And on the rest shall not think best,
compassions skirts to throw.
Whom injure I? will you envy,
and grudge at others weal?
Or me accuse, who do refuse
your selves to help and heal.
(179)
Am I alone of what is my own, Mat. 20, 15.

no Master or no Lord?
Or if I am, how can you claim
what I to some afford?
Will you demand Grace at my hand,
and challenge what is mine?
Will you teach me whom to set free,
and thus my Grace confine?
(180)
Psa. 58 3 To. 6.21 Gal 3.10. Romans 8 29.30. and 11.7. Rev* 21.27. Luke 12.4 8.
Mat. 11.22. The wicked all convinced and put to silence. To. 3.19 Mat. 22.12.
Behold the formidable estate of all the ungodly, as they stand hopeless and
helpless before an impartial Judge, expecting their final Sentence. Rev. 6.16,
17.
You sinners are, and such a share
as sinners may expect,
Such you shall have; for I do save
none but mine own Elect.
Yet to compare your sin with their,
who lived a longer time,
I do confess yours is much less,
though every sin's a crime.
(181)
A crime it is, therefore in bliss
you may not hope to dwell;
But unto you I shall allow
the easiest room in Hell.
The glorious King thus answering,
they cease, and plead no longer:
Their Consciences must needs confess
his Reasons are the stronger.
(182)
Thus all men's Pleas the Judge with ease
does answer and confute,
Until that all, both great and small,
are silenced and mute
Vain hopes are cropped, all mouths are stopped
sinners have ^ought to say,
But that 'is just, and equal me^
they should be damned for ay*
(183)
Now what remains, but that to pains
and everlasting smart,
Christ should condemn the Sons of men,
which is their just desert;
Oh rueful plights of sinful wights!
Oh wretches all forlorn:
'T had happy been they never had seen
the Sun, or not been born.
(184)
Yea, now it would be good they could
themselves annihilate,
And cease to be, themselves to free
from such a fearful state.
Oh happy Dogs, and Swine, and Frogs:
yea Serpents generation,
Who do not fear this doom to hear,
and sentence of Damnation!
(185)
This is their state so desperate: Psa 139.2, 3, 4. Eccl 12.14.

their sins are fully known;
Their vanities and villainies
before the world are shown.
As they are gross and impious,
so are their numbers more
Than motes in the Air, or then their hair,
or sands upon the shore.
(186)
Divine Justice offended is
and Satisfaction claims:
God's wrathful ire kindled like fire,
against them fiercely flameth.
Their Judge severe does quite cashier
and all their Pleas off take, Mat. 25.45.

That never a man, or dare, or can
a further Answer make.
(187)
Their mouths are shut, Mat. 22.12. Romans 2.5, 6. Luk 19.42
each man is put
to silence and to shame:
Nor have they ought within their thought,
Christ's Justice for to blame.
The Judge is just, and plague them must.
nor will he mercy show
For Mercies day is past away)
to any of this Crew.
(188)
Mat. 28 2^. Psalm 139.^
The Judge is strong, doers of wrong
cannot his power withstand:
None can by flight run out of fight,
nor escape out of his hand.
Sad is their state: for Advocate
to plead their Cause there is none:
None to prevent their punishment,
o^ misery bemo^e.
(189)
O dismal day! whither shall they
for help and succor flee?
To God above, with hopes to move
their greatest Enemee:
His wrath is great, whose burning heat
Isa. 33.14 Psalm. 11.6 Numb. 23 19.
no flood of tears can slake:
His word stands fast, that they be cast into the burning Lake.
(190)
To Christ their Judge, he does adjudge
Matt. 25.41.
them to the Pit of Sorrow;
Nor will he hear, or cry, or tear,
nor respite them one morrow.
Matt. 25, 10, 11, 12.
To Heaven alas, they cannot pass,
it is against them shut;
To enter there [O heavy cheer]
they out of hopes are ^ut.
(191)
Luke 12.^0 Psalm. 49.7, 17.
Unto their Treasures, or to their Pleasures,
all these have them forsaken:
Had they full Coffers to make large offers,
their Gold would not be taken
Unto the place where whilome was
Deuteronomy. 32.22.
their Birth and Education?
Lo! Christ begins for their great sins
to fire the Earths Foundation:
(192)
And by and by the flaming Sky 2 Pet. 3.10.

shall drop like molten Lead
About their ears, to increase their fears,
and aggravate their dread.
To Angels good that ever stood
in their integrity,
Should they betake themselves, and make
their suit incessantly?
(193)
They neither skill, Matt. 13.41, 42.
nor do they will
to work them any ease:
They will not mourn to see them burn,
nor beg for their release.
To wicked men, their brethren,
in sin and wickedness.
Should they make moan? their case is one, Rev. 20.13,15.

they are in the same distress,
(194)
Ah, cold comfort, and mean support
from such like Comforters!
Ah, little joy of Company,
and fellow sufferers!
Such shall increase their hearts disease, Luk 16 28.

and add unto their woe,
Because that they brought to decay
themselves and many more.
(195)
Unto the Saints with sad complaints
should they themselves apply?
They Are not dejected, Rev 21 4
nor ought affected
with all their misery.
Friends stand aloof, and make no proof
what Prayers or Tears can do: Psalm. 58.10.

Your godly friends are now more friends
to Christ than unto you,
(196)
Where tender love men's hearts did move
unto a sympathy,
And bearing part of others smart
in their anxiety;
1 Cor. 6.2.
Now such compassion is out of fashion,
and wholly laid aside:
No Friends so near, but Saints to hear
their Sentence can abide.
(197)
One natural Brother beholds another
in this astonished fit,
Compare Prove. 1.26. with 1 Job. 3.2. and 2 Cor. 5.16.
Yet sorrows not thereat a jot,
nor pitties him a whit.
The godly wife conceives no grief,
nor can she shed a tear
For the sad state of her dear Mate,
when she his doom does hear.
(198)
He that was erst a Husband pierced
with sense of Wives distress,
Whose tender heart did bear a part
of all her grievances,
Shall mourn no more as heretofore
because of her ill plight;
Although he see her now to be
a damned forsaken wight.
(199)
The tender Mother will own no other
of all her numerous brood,
But such as stand at Christ's right hand
acquitted through his Blood.
The pious Father had now much rather
Luke 16.25.
his graceless Son should ly
In Hell with Devils, for all his evils
burning eternally.
(200)
Then God most high should injury,
by sparing him sustain; Psalm. 58.10.

And does rejoice to hear Christ's voice
adjudging him to pain.
Who having all, both great and small,
convinced and silenced,
Did then proceed their Doom to read,
and thus it uttered,
(201)
Ye sinful wights, and cursed sprights, The Judge pronounces the Sentence of
condemnation. Mat 25.41.

that work Iniquity,
Departs together from me for ever
to endless Misery;
Your portion take in yonder Lake,
where Fire and Brimstone flameth.
Suffer the smart, which your desert
as it is due wages claims.
(202)
Oh piercing words more sharp than swords!
what, to depart from Thee,
Whose fa^e before for evermore The terror of it.

the best of Pleasures be!
What? to depart (unto our smart)
from thee Eternally:
To be for aye banished away,
with Devils company!
(203)
What? to be sent to Punishment,
and flames of Burning Fire,
To be surrounded, and eke confounded
with Gods Revengful ire.
What? to abide, not for a tide
these Torments, but for Ever:
To be released, or to be eased,
not after years, but Never.
(204)
Oh, fearful Doom! now there is no room
for hope or help at all:
Sentence is past which aye shall last,
Christ will not it recall.
There might you hear them rent and tear
the Air with their outcries:
The hideous noise of their sad voice
ascends to the Skies.
(205)
Luke 13.28.
They wring their hands, their caitiff-hands
and gnash their teeth for terror;
They cry, they roar for anguish sore,
and gnaw their tongues for horror.
But get away without delay,
Christ pitties not your cry:
Depart to Hell, there may you yell,
Prove. 1, 26
and roar Eternally.
(206)
It is put in Execution.
That word, Depart, maugre their heart,
drives every wicked one,
With mighty power, the self-same hour,
far from the Judge's Throne.
Mat. 25.46
Away they are chaste by the strong blast
of his Death-threatning mouth:
They flee full fast, as if in haste,
although they be full loath.
(207)
As chaff that is dry, and dust does fly
before the Northern wind:
Right so are they chased away,
and can no Refuge find.
They hasten to the Pit of Woe,
Matt. 13.41, 42.
guarded by Angels stout;
Who to fulfill Christ's holy will,
attend this wicked Rout.
(208)
Whom having brought, as they are taught, HELL. Mat. 25.30. Mark. 9.43. Isa
30.33 Rev. 21.8.

unto the brink of Hell
(That dismal place far from Christ's face,
where Death and Darkness dwell:
Where Gods fierce ^e kindles the fire,
and vengeance feeds the flame
With piles of Wood, and Brimstone Flood,
that none can quench the same*)
(209) Wicked Men and Devils cast into it for ever. Mat. 22.13. and 25.46.

With Iron bands they bind their hands,
and cursed feet together,
And cast them all, both great and small,
into that Lake for ever.
Where day and night, without respite,
they wail, and cry, and howl
For torturing pain, which they sustain
in Body and in Soul.
(210)
For day and night, in their despite* Rev. 14.10, 11.

their torments smoke ascends.
Their pain and grief have no relief,
their anguish never ends.
There must they ly, and never die,
though dying every day:
There must they dying ever ly,
and not consume away.
(211)
Die fain they would, if die they could,
but Death will not be had.
God's direful wrath their bodies has
for ever Immortal made.
They live to ly in misery,
and bear eternal woe;
And live they must whilst God is just,
that he may plague them so.
(212)
The unsufferable torments of the damned. Luke 16.24. Jude 7.
But who can tell the plagues of Hell,
and torments exquisi^e?
Who can relate their dismal state,
and terrors infinite?
Who fare the best, and feel the least,
yet feel that punishment
Whereby to naught they should be brought,
if God did not prevent.
(213)
The least degree of misery
there felt's incomparable,
The lightest pain they there sustain
Isa. 33.14. Mark 9.43, 44.
more than intolerable.
But God's great power from hour to hour
upholds them in the fire,
That they shall not consume a jot,
nor by it is force expire.
(214)
But ah, the woe they undergo
(they more than all besides)
Who had the light, and knew the right,
Luke 12.47.
yet would not it abide.
The sev'n-fold smart, which to their part,
and portion does fall,
Who Christ his Grace would not embrace,
nor hearken to his call.
(215)
The Amorites and Sodomites
Mat. 11.24.
although their plagues be sore,
Yet find some ease, compared to these,
who feel a great deal more.
Almighty God, whose Iron Rod,
to smite them never lins.
Does most declare his Justice rare
in plaguing these men's sins.
(216)
The pain of loss their Souls does toss, Luk 16.23, 25. Luk 13.28.

and wond'rously distress,
To think what they have cast away
by wilful wickedness.
We might have been redeemed from sin
think they, and lived above,
Being possessed of heavenly rest,
and joying in God's love.
(217)
But woe, woe, woe our Souls unto! Luke 13.34.

we would not happy be;
And therefore bear Gods Vengeance here
to all Eternitee.
Experience and woeful sense
must be our painful teachers
Who n'ould believe, nor credit give,
unto our faithful Preachers.
(218)
Thus shall they ly, and wail, and cry, Mark 9.44 Romans 2.15.

tormented, and tormenting
Their galled hearts with pois'ned darts
but now too late repenting.
There let them dwell in the Flames of Hell:
there leave we them to burn, The Saints rejoice to see Judgment executed upon
the wicked World. Ps 58 10 Rev. 19.1, 2, 3.

And back again unto the men
whom Christ acquits, return,
(219)
The Saints behold with courage bold,
and thankful wonderment,
To see all those that were their foes
thus sent to punishment:
Then do they sing unto their King
a Song of endless Praise:
They praise his Name, and do proclaim
that just are all his ways.
They ascend with Christ into Heaven triumphing. Mat. 25.46. 1 John 3.2. 1 Cor.
13.12. Their Eternal happiness and incomparable Glory there.
(220)
Thus with great joy and melody
to Heaven they all ascend,
Him there to praise with sweetest lays,
and Hymns that never end.
Where with long Rest they shall be blessed,
and naught shall them annoy:
Where they shall see as seen they be,
and whom they love enjoy.
(221)
O glorious Place! where face to face
Jehovah may be seen,
By such as were sinners whilere
and no dark vail between.
Where the Sun shine, and light Divine,
of Gods bright Countenance,
Does rest upon them every one,
with sweetest influence.
(222)
O blessed state of the Renate!
O wondrous Happiness,
To which they are brought, beyond what thought
can reach, or words express!
Rev. 21.4.
Griefs watercourse, and sorrows sourse,
are turned to joyful streams.
Their old distress and heaviness
are vanished like dreams.
(223)
For God above in arms of love
does dearly them embrace,
(...) 6.11.
And fills their sprights with such delights,
and pleasures in his grace;
As shall not fail, nor yet grow stale
through frequency of use:
Nor do they fear Gods favor there,
to forfeit by abuse.
(224)
For there the Saints are perfect Saints, Heb. 12.23.

and holy ones indeed,
From all the sin that dwelt within
their mortal bodies freed: Rev. 1.6. and 22.5.

Made Kings and Priests to God through Christ's
dear loves transcendency
There to remain, and there to reign
with his Eternally.
A A Short Discourse ON ETERNITY.
(1)
WHat Mortal man can with his Span
mete out Eternity?
Or fathom it by depth of Wit, Isa. 57.15. Mark 3.29. Mat. 25.46.

or strength of Memory?
The lofty Sky is not so high,
Hells depth to this is small:
The World so wide is but a stride,
compared therewithal.
(2)
It is a main great Ocean,
withouten bank or bound:
A deep Abyss, wherein there is
no bottom to be found.
This World has stood now since the Flood,
four thousand years well near,
And had before endured more
than sixteen hundred year.
(3)
But what is the time from the Worlds prime
unto this present day,
If we thereby Eternity
to measure should assay?
The whole duration since the Creation,
though long, yet is more little,
If placed by Eternity,
then is the smallest little.
(4)
Tell every Star both near and far,
in Heavens bright Canopee,
That does appear throughout the year,
of high or low degree:
Tell every Tree that thou can see
in this vast Wilderness,
Up in ^e Woods, down by the Floods
in thousand miles progress.
(5)
The sum is vast, yet not so vast,
but that thou may go on
To multiply the Leaves thereby,
that hang those Trees upon:
Add thereunto tho Drops, that thou
imaginest to be
In April Showers, that bring forth Flowers,
and blossoms plenteously:
(6)
Number the Fowls and living Souls
that through the Air do Fly,
The winged Hosts in all their Coasts
beneath the Starry Sky:
Count all the Grass as thou do pass
through many a pasture-land,
And dewy Drops that on the tops
of Herbs and Plants do stand.
(7)
Number the Sand upon the Strand,
and ^tomes of the Air;
And do thy best on Man and Beast,
to reckon every Hair:
Take all the Dust, if so thou lust, 2 These. 1.9. Rev. 14.11.

and add to thine Account:
Yet shall the Years of sinners tears,
the Number far surmount.
(8)
Naught joined to naught can never make ought,
nor Ciphers make a Sum:
Nor things Finite, to infinite
by multiplying come:
A Cockle-shell may serve as well
to lade the Ocean dry,
As finite things and Reckonings
to bound Eternity.
(9)
O happy they that live for aye, 1 These. 4.17. Rom 8.38, 39.

with Christ in Heaven above!
Who know withal, that nothing shall
deprive them of his love.
Eternity, Eternity!
Oh, were it not for thee,
The Saints in bliss and happiness
could never happy be.
(10)
For if they were in any fear, 1 John 4.18. Joh. 6.35 40, 51. Rev. 21 4

that this their joy might cease,
It would annoy [if not destroy]
and interrupt their peace:
But being sure it shall endure
so long as God shall live;
The thoughts of this unto their bliss,
do full perfection give.
(11)
Heb. 12.12.
Cheer up, ye Saints, amidst your wants,
and sorrows many a one.
Lift up the head, shake off all dread.
and moderate your moan.
Your sufferings and evil things
2 Cor. 4.17. Psalm. 16.11.
will suddenly be past.
Your sweet Fruitions, and blessed Vision.
for evermore shall last.
(12)
Lament and mourn you that must burn
Luk 13.28. Mat. 25 41, 46. Rev. 14.11.
amidst those flaming Seas:
If once you come to such a doom,
for ever farewell ease.
O sad estate and desperate,
that never can be mended,
Until Gods Will shall change, or till
Eternity be ended!
(13)
If any one this Question
shall unto me propound;
What, have the years of sinners tears
no limits, or no bound?
Mark 9.43, 44.
It kills our heart to think of smart,
and pains that last for ever;
And hear of fire that shall expire,
or be extinguished never.
(14)
I Will Answer make (and let them take
my words as I intend them:
For this is all the Cordial
that here I have to lend them)
When Heaven shall cease to flow with peace
and all felicity;
Then Hell may cease to be the place
of Woe and Misery.
(15)
When Heaven is Hell, when Ill is Well,
when Virtue turns to Vice,
When wrong is Right, when Dark is Light,
when Naught is of great price:
Then may the years of sinners tears
and sufferings expire,
And all the hosts of damned ghosts
escape out of Hellfire.
(16)
When Christ above shall cease to love
when God shall cease to reign,
And be no more, as heretofore,
the Worlds great Sovereign.
Or not be just (...) ^avour lust,
or in men's (...) ^elight:
Then wicked men [and not till then]
to Heaven may take their flight.
(17)
When Gods great Power shall be brought lower,
by foreign Puissance:
Or be decayed, and weaker made
through Times continuance:
When drowsiness shall him oppress,
and lay him fast asleep:
Then sinful men may break their pen,
and out of Prison creep.
(18)
When those in Glory shall be right sorry
they may not change their place,
And wish to dwell with them in Hell,
never to see Christ's face:
Then those in pain may freedom gain,
and be with Glory dight:
Then Hellish Fiends may be Christ's Friends,
and Heirs of Heaven hight.
(19)
Then, Ah poor men! what, not till then?
No, not an hour before:
For God is just, and therefore must
torment them evermore.
ETERNITY! ETERNITY!
thou make hard hearts to bleed:
The thoughts of thee in misery,
do make men wail indeed.
(20)
When they remind what is still behind,
Mark 9.43, 44.45, 46. and.
and ponder this word NEVER,
That they must here be made to bear
Gods Vengeance for EVER:
The thought of this more (...) is,
then all they feel beside:
Yet what they feel, nor heart of steel,
nor Flesh of Brass can bide.
(21)
To lie in woe, and undergo
2 These. 1.8, 9.
the direful pains of Hell,
And know withal, that there they shall
for aye, and ever dwell;
And that they are from rest as far
Mat. 25.46. Rev 14.10, 11.
when fifty thousand year,
Twice told, are spent in punishment,
as when they first came there.
(22)
This, Oh! this makes Hells fiery flakes
much more intolerable;
This makes frail wights and damned sprights,
to bear their plagues unable.
This makes man bite, for fell despite,
their very tongues in twain:
This makes them rore for great horror,
and trebleth all their pain.
A Postscript UNTO THE Reader.
AND now good Reader, I return again
To talk with thee, who have been at the pain
To read throughout, and heed what went before;
And unto thee I Will speak a little more.
Give ear, I pray thee, unto what I say,
That God may hear thy voice another day.
Thou have a Soul, my friend, and so have I,
To save or lose; a Soul that cannot die,
A soul of greater price than Gold and Gems;
A Soul more worth than Crowns and Diadems;
A Soul at first created like its Maker,
And of Gods Image made to be partaker:
Upon the wings of Noblest Faculties,
Taught for to soar above the Starry Skies,
And not to rest, until it understood
It self possessed of the chiefest good.
And since the Fall, thy Soul retains still
Those Faculties of Reason and of Will,
But Oh, how much depraved, and out of frame,
As if they were some others, not the same.
Thine Understanding dismally benighted,
And Reason's eye in Sp'ritual things dim-sighted,
Or else stark blind: Thy Will inclined to evil,
And nothing else, a Slave unto the Devil;
That loves to live, and lives to transgress,
But shuns the way of God and Holiness.
All thine Affections are disordered;
And thou by headstrong Passions are misled.
What need I tell thee of thy crooked way,
And many wicked wand'rings every day?
Or that thine own transgressions are more
In number, than the sands upon the Shore:
Thou art a lump of wickedness become,
And may with horror think upon thy Doom.
Until thy Soul be washed in the flood
Of Christ's most dear, soul-cleansing precious blood.
That, that alone can do away thy sin
Which thou were born, and have long lived in,
That, only that, can pacify Gods wrath,
If apprehended by a lively Faith.
Now whilst the day and means of Grace do last,
Before the opportunity be past.
But if, O man, thou liv'st a Christless creature,
And Death surprise thee in a state of nature,
(As who can tell but that may be thy case)
How will thou stand before the Judge's face?
When he shall be revealed in flaming fire,
And come to pay ungodly men their hire:
To execute due vengeance upon those
That knew him not, or that have been his foes:
What will thou answer unto his demands,
When he requires a reason at thy hands
Of all the things that thou have said, or done,
Or left undone, or set thine heart upon?
When he shall thus with thee expostulate,
What cause had thou thy Maker for to hate,
To take up Arms against thy Sovereign,
And Enmity against him to maintain?
What injury has God Almighty done thee?
What good has he withheld that might have won thee.
What evil, or injustice, have thou found
In him, that might unto thine hurt redound?
If neither felt, nor feared injury
Has moved thee to such hostility;
What made thee then the Fountain to forsake,
And unto broken Pits thy self betake?
What reason had thou to dishonor God,
Who thee with Mercies never cease to load?
Because the Lord was good, have thou been evil,
And taken part against him with the Devil?
For all his cost to pay him with despite,
And all his love with hatred to requite?
Is this the fruit of Gods great patience,
To wax more bold in disobedience?
To kick against the bowels of his Love,
Is this aright his Bounty to improve?
Stand still, ye Heavens and be astonished,
That God by man should thus be injured!
Give ear, O Earth, and tremble at the sin
Of those that thine Inhabitants have bin.
But thou, vile wretch, have added unto all
Thine other faults, and facts so criminal,
The damning sin of wilful unbelief,
Of all Transgressors had thou been the chief;
Yet when time was, thou might have been set free
From Sin, and Wrath, and punishment by me.
But thou would not accept of Gospel Grace,
Nor on my terms Eternal Life embrace.
As if that all thy breaches of Gods Law
Were not enough upon thy head to draw
Eternal Wrath: Thou have despised a Savior,
Rejected me, and trampled on my favor.
How often have I stood knocking at thy door,
And been denied entrance evermore?
How often has my Spirit been withstood,
When as I sent him to have done thee good?
Thou have no need of any one to plead
Thy Cause, or for thy Soul to intercede:
Plead for thy self, if thou have ought to say,
And pay thy forfeiture without delay.
Behold thou do ten thousand Talents owe,
Or pay thy Debt, or else to Prison go.
Think, think, O Man, when Christ shall thus unfol^
Thy secret guilt, and make thee to behold
The ugly face of all thy sinful errors,
And fill thy Soul with his amazing terrors,
And let thee see the flaming Pit of Hell
(Where all that have no part in him shall dwell)
When he shall thus expostulate the case,
How can thou bear to look him in the face?
What will thou do without an Advocate?
Or plead, when as thy state is desperate?
Do think to put him off with fair pretenses?
Or will thou hide and cover thine offenses?
Can any thing from him concealed be,
Who does the hidden things of darkness see?
Ar^ thou of force his Power to withstand?
Can thou by might escape out of his hand?
Do thou intend to run out of his sight,
And save thy self from punishment by flight?
Or will thou be eternally accursed,
And bide his Vengeance, let him do his worst?
Oh, who can bear his indignations heat?
Or bide the pains of Hell, which are so great?
^f then thou neither can his Wrath endure,
Nor any Ransom after death procure:
^f neither Cries nor Tears can move his heart
To pardon thee, or mittigate thy smart,
But unto Hell thou must perforce be sent
With dismal horror and astonishment:
Consider, O my Friends, what cause thou have
With fear and trembling (while as yet thou may)
To lay to heart thy sin and misery,
And to make out after the Remedy.
Consider well the greatness of thy danger,
O Child of wrath, and object of Gods anger*
Thou hangest o^r the Infernal Pit
By one small thread, and car'st thou not a whit?
There Is but a step between thy Soul and Death,
Nothing remains but stopping of thy breath,
(Which may be done to morrow, or before)
And then thou art undone for evermore.
Let this awaken thy Security,
And make thee look about thee speedily,
How can thou rest an hour or sleep a night,
Or in thy Creature comforts take delight;
Or with vain Toys thy self forgetful make
How near thou art unto the burning Lake?
How can thou live without tormenting fears?
How can thou hold from weeping floods of tears,
Yea, tears of blood, I might almost have sed,
(...) such like tears could from thine eyes be shed?
To gain the world what will it profit (...),
And loose thy Soul and self eternally?
Eternity on one small point depends:
The man is lost that this short life mispendeth
For as the Tree does fall, right so it lies;
And man continues in what state he dies.
Who happy die, shall happy rise again;
Who cursed die, shall cursed still remain,
If under Sin, and Wrath, Death leaves thee bound,
At Judgment under Wrath thou shall be found:
And then woe, woe that ever thou were born,
O wretched man, of Heaven and Earth forlorn!
Consider this, all ye that God forget,
Who all his threatenings at naught do set,
Lest into pieces he begin to tear
Your Souls, and there be no deliverer.
O you that now sing care and fear away,
Think often of the formidable Day,
Wherein the Heavens with a mighty noise,
And with a hideous heart^confounding voice.
Shall pass away together being rolled.
As men are wont their garments for to fold.
When the Elements with fervent heat shall ^elt,
And living Creatures in the same shall swelt,
And altogether in those Flames expire.
Which set the Earths Foundations on fire.
Oh, what amazement will your hearts be in,
And how will you to curse your selves begin
For all your damned sloth, and negligence,
And unbelief, and gross Impenitence,
When you shall hear that dreadful Sentence past,
That all the wicked into Hell be cast?
What horror will your Consciences surprise,
When you shall hear the fruitless doleful cries
Of such as are compelled to depart
Unto the place of everlasting smart?
What, when you see the sparks fly out of Hell,
And view the Dungeon where you are to dwell,
Wherein you must eternally remain
In anguish, and intolerable pain?
What, when your hands and feet are bound together,
And you are cast into that Lake for ever?
Then shall you feel the truth of what you hear,
That hellish pains are more than you can bear,
And that those Torments are an hundred fold
More terrible than ever you were told,
Nor speak I this, good Reader, to torment thee
Before the time, but rather to prevent thee
From running headlong to thine own decay,
In such a perilous and deadly way.
We, who have known and felt Jehovah's terrors,
Persuade men to repent them of their errors,
And turn to God in time, e're his Decree
Bring forth, and then there be no Remedee*
If in the night, when thou art fast asleep,
Some friend of thine, that better watch does keep,
Should see thy house all on a burning flame,
And thee almost enclosed with the same:
If such a friend should break thy door and wake thee,
Or else by force out of the peril ^e thee:
What? would thou take his kindness in ill part?
Or frown upon him for his good desert?
Such, O my friend, such is thy present state.
And danger, being unregenerate.
Awake, awake, and then thou shall percei^
Thy peril greater then thou will believe.
Lift up thine eyes, and see Gods wrathful ^re,
Preparing unextinguishable fire
For all that live and die impenitent.
Awake, awake, O Sinner, and repent,
And quarrel not, because I thus alarm
Thy Soul, to save it from eternal harm.
Perhaps thou harbourest such thoughts as these,
I hope I may enjoy my carnal ease
A little longer, and m^ self refresh
With those delights that gratify the flesh;
And yet repent before it be too late.
And get into a comfortable state*
I hope I have yet many years to spend,
And time enough those matters to attend.
Presumptuous heart! Is God engaged to give
A longer time to such as love to live
Like Rebels still, who think to stain his Glory
By wickedness, and after to be sorry?
Unto thy lust shall he be made a drudge,
Who thee, and all ungodly men, shall judge?
Can thou account sin sweet, and yet confess,
That first, or last, it ends in bitterness?
Is sin a thing that must procure thee sorrow?
And would thou daily with it another morrow?
O foolish man, who love to enjoy
That which will thee distress, or else destroy!
What gained Sampson by his Delilah?
What gained David by his Bathsheba?
The one became a Slave, lost both his eyes,
And made them sport that were his Enemies:
The other penneth, as a certain token
Of Gods displeasure, that his bones were broken,
Besides the woes he after met withal,
To chasten him for that his grievous Fall:
His own Son Amnon using crafty wiles,
His Daughter Thamar wickedly defiles;
His second Son more beautiful than good,
His hands embreweth in his Brothers Blood:
And by and by aspiring to the Crown,
He strives to pull his gentle Father down*
With hellish rage, him fiercely persecuting,
And bruitishly his Concubines polluting.
Read whosoever list, and ponder what he reads,
And he shall find small joy in evil deeds*
Moreover this consider, that the longer
Thou liv'st in sin, thy sin will grow the stronger.
And then it will an harder matter prove,
To leave those wicked haunts that thou do love*
The Black-moor may as easily change his skin,
As old transgressors leave their wonted sin.
And who can tell what may become of thee,
Or where thy Soul in one days time may be?
We see that Death ^er old no^ young men spares,
But one and other takes at unawares.
For in a moment, whilst men Peace do cry,
Destruction seizes on them suddenly.
Thou who this morning art a lively wight,
May be a Corpse and damned Ghost ere night*
Oh, dream not then, that it will serve the turn,
Upon thy death bed for thy sins to mourn.
But think how many have been snatched away,
And had no time for mercy once to pray.
It Is just with God Repentance to deny
To such as put it off until they die.
And late Repentance seldom proves true,
Which if it fail, thou know what must ensue.
For after this short life is at an end*
What is amiss thou never can amend,
Believe, O m^n, that to procrastinate,
And put it off until i^ be too late,
As it is thy sin, so is it Satan's wile,
Whereby he does great multitudes beguile*
How many thousands has this strong delusion
Already brought to ruin and confusion,
Whose Souls are now reserved in Iron Chains,
Under thick darkness to eternal pains?
They thought of many years, as thou do now,
But were deceived quite, and so may thou.
Oh, then my friend, while not away thy time,
Nor by rebellion aggravate thy Crime.
Oh put not off Repentance till to morrow,
Adventure nor without Gods leave to borrow
Another day to spend upon thy lust,
Lest God (that is most holy, wise, and just)
Denounce in wrath, and to thy terror say
This night shall Devils fetch thy Soul away.
Now seek the face of God with all thy heart;
Acknowledge unto him how vile thou art.
Tell him thy sins deserve eternal wrath,
And that it is a wonder that he has
Permitted thee so long to draw thy breath,
Who might have cut thee off by sudden death,
And sent thy Soul into the lowest Pit,
From whence no price should ever ransom it,
And that he may most justly do it still
(Because thou have deserved it) if he will.
Yet also tell him that, if he shall please,
He can forgive thy Sins, and thee release.
And that in Christ his Son he may be just,
And justify all those that on him trust:
That though thy sins are of a crimson die,
Yet Christ his Blood can cleanse thee thoroughly*
Tell him, that he may make his glorious Name
More wonderful by covering thy shame.
That Mercy may be greatly magnified,
And Justice also fully satisfied,
If he shall please to own thee in his Son,
Who has paid dear for Men's Redemption.
Tell him thou have an unbelieving heart,
Which hinders thee from coming for a part
In Christ: and that although his terrors aw thee,
Thou can not come till he be pleased to draw thee.
Tell him thou know thine heart to be so bad,
And thy condition so exceeding sad,
That though Salvation may be had for naught,
Thou can not come and take, till thou be brought.
Oh beg of him to bow thy stubborn Will
To come to Christ, that he thy lusts may kill.
Look up to Christ for his attractive power,
Which he exerteth in a needful hour;
Who says, whenas I lifted up shall be,
Then will I draw all sorts of men to me.
O wait upon him with true diligence,
And trembling fear in every Ordinance.
Unto his call earnest attention give,
Whose voice makes deaf men hear, and dead men live.
Thus weep, and mourn, thus hearken, pray and wait,
Till he behold, and pity thine estate,
Who is more ready to bestow his Grace,
Then thou the same art willing to embrace;
Yea, he has Might enough to bring thee home,
Though thou have neither strength nor will to come.
If he delay to answer thy request*
Know that oft-times he does it for the best.
Not with intent to drive us from his door,
But for to make us importune him more;
Or else to bring us duly to confess,
And be convinced of our unworthiness.
Oh, be not weary then, but persevere
To beg his Grace till he thy suit shall hear:
And leave him not, nor from his footstool go,
Till over thee Compassions skirt he throw.
Eternal Life will recompense thy pains,
If found at last, with everlasting gains.
For if the Lord be pleased to hear thy cries,
And to forgive thy great iniquities;
Thou will have cause for ever to admire,
And land his Grace, that granted thy desire,
Then shall thou find thy labor is not lost:
But that the good obtained surmounts the cost.
Nor shall thou grieve for loss of sinful pleasures,
Exchanged for heavenly joys and lasting treasures.
The yoke of Christ, which once thou did esteem
A tedious yoke, shall then most easy seem.
For why? The love of Christ shall thee constrain
To take delight in that which was thy pain.
The ways of Wisdom shall be pleasant ways,
And thou shall choose therein to spend thy days;
If once thy Soul be brought to such a pass:
O bless the Lord, and magnify his Grace.
Thou, that of late had reason to be sad,
May now rejoice, and be exceeding glad,
For thy condition is as happy now,
As erst it was disconsolate and low.
Thou art become as rich, as whilome poor,
As blessed now, as cursed heretofore.
For being cleansed with Christ's precious Blood,
Thou have an interest in the chiefest good:
Gods anger is toward thy Soul appeased.
And in his Christ he is with thee well pleased.
Yea, he does look upon thee with a mild
And gracious aspect as upon his child.
He is become thy Father and thy Friend,
And will defend thee from the cursed Friend.
Thou need'st nor fear the roaring Lyon's rage,
Since God Almighty does himself engage
To bear thy Soul in Everlasting Arms,
Above the reach of all destructive harms*
What ever here thy sufferings may be,
Yet from them all the Lord shall rescue thee.
He will preserve thee by his wondrous might
Unto that rich Inheritance in light.
Oh, sing for joy, all ye regenerate,
Whom Christ has brought into this blessed state!
O love the Lord, all ye his Sains, who has
Redeemed you from everlasting wrath:
Who has by dying made your Souls to live,
And what he dearly bought does freely give:
Give up your selves to walk in all his ways,
And study how to live unto his praise.
The time is short you have to serve him here:
The day of your deliverance draws near.
Lift up your heads, ye upright ones in heart,
Who in Christ's purchase have obtained a part.
Behold, he rides upon a shining Cloud,
With Angels voice, and Trumpet sounding loud;
He comes to save his folk from all their foes,
And plague the men that Holiness oppose.
So come, Lord Jesus, quickly come we pray:
Yea come, and hasten our Redemption day.
A SONG OF EMPTINESS, To fill up the Empty Pages following. Vanity of Vanities.
VAin, frail, short lived, and miserable Man,
Learn what thou art when thine estate is best:
A restless Wave of the troubled Ocean,
A Dream, a lifeless Picture finely dressed:
A Wind, a Flower, a Vapor, and a Bubble,
A Wheel that stands nor still, a trembling Reed,
A rolling Stone, dry Dust, light Chaff, and Stubble,
A Shadow of Something, but naught indeed.
Learn what deceitful Toys, and empty things,
This World, and all its best Enjoyments be:
Out of the Earth no true Contentment springs,
But all things here are vexing Vanitee.
For what is Beauty, but a fading Flower?
Or what is Pleasure, but the Devils bait,
Whereby he catches whom he would devour,
And multitudes of Souls does ruinate?
And what are Friends but mortal men, as we?
Whom Death from us may quickly separate;
Or else their hearts may quite estranged be,
And all their love be turned into hate.
And what are Riches to be doted on?
Uncertain, sickle, and ensnaring things;
They draw Men's Souls into Perdition,
And when most needed, take them to their wings,
Ah foolish Man! that sets his heart upon
Such empty Shadows, such wild Fowl as these,
That being gotten will be quickly gone.
And whilst they stay increase but his disease.
As in a Dropsy, drinking draughts begets,
The more he drinks, the more he still requires,
So on this World whosoever affection sets,
His Wealths increase increases his desires.
O happy Man, whose portion is above,
WhereFloods, where Flames, where Foes cannot bereave him,
Most wretched man, that fixed has his love
Upon this World, that surely will deceive him.
For, what is Honor? What is Sov'raignty,
Whereto men's hearts so restlesly aspire?
Whom have they Crowned with Felicity?
When did they ever satisfy desire?
The Ear of Man with hearing is not filled;
To see new sights still coveteth the Eye:
The craving Stomach though it may be stilled,
Yet craves again without a new supply.
All Earthly things, man's Cravings answer not,
Whose little heart would all the World contain,
(If all the World should fall to one man's Lot)
And notwithstanding empty still remain.
The Eastern Conqueror was said to weep,
When he the Indian Ocean did view,
To see his Conquest bounded by the Deep,
And no more Worlds remaining to subdue.
Who would that man in his Enjoyments bless,
Or envy him, or covet his estate,
Whose gettings do augment his greediness,
And make his wishes more intemperate?
Such is the wonted and the common guise
Of those on Earth that bear the greatest Sway;
If with a few the case be otherwise
They seek a Kingdom that abides for ay.
Moreover they, of all the Sons of men,
That Rule, and are in highest places set,
Are most inclined to scorn their Brethren
And God himself (without great grace) forget.
For as the Sun does blind the gazer's eyes,
That for a time they naught discern aright:
So Honor does befool and blind the Wise,
And their own Luster 'reaves them of their sight.
Great are their Dangers, manifold their Cares;
Through which, whilst others Sleep, they scarcely Nap;
And yet are often surprised unawares,
And fall unweeting into Envies Trap.
The mean Mechanic finds his kindly rest
All void of fear Sleeps the Country-Clown:
When greatest Princes often are distressed,
And cannot Sleep upon their Beds of Down.
Could Strength or Valor men Immortalize,
Could Wealth or Honor keep them from decay,
There were some cause the same to Idolize,
and give the lie to that which I do say.
^it neither can such things themselves endure
Without the hazard of a Change one hour,
^or such as trust in them can they secure
from dismal days, or Deaths prevailing power.
(...) Beauty could the beautiful desend
from Death's dominion, than fair Absalom
^ad not been brought to such a shameful end:
But fair and foul unto the Grave must come.
If Wealth or Scepters could Immortal make,
Then wealthy Craesus, wherefore art thou dead?
If Warlike force, which makes the World to quake,
Then why is Julius Caesar perished?
Where are the Scipio's Thunderbolts of War?
Renowned Pompey, Caesar's Enemy?
Stout Hannibal, Romes Terror known so far?
Great Alexander, what is become of thee?
If Gifts and Bribes Death's favor might but win,
If Power, if force, or Threatenings might it fray,
All these, and more, had still surviving been:
But all are gone, for Death will have no Nay.
Such is this World with all her Pomp and Glory,
Such are the men whom worldly eyes admire:
Cut down by Time, and now become a Story,
That we might after better things aspire.
Go boast thy self of what thy heart enjoyes,
Vain Man! triumph in all thy worldly Bliss:
Thy best enjoyments are but Trash and Toys:
Delight thy self in that which worthless is.
Omnia praetereunt praeter amare Deum.
FINIS.
