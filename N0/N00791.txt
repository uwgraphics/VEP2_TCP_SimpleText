Upon Mr. Samuel Willard, his first coming into the Assembly, and Praying,
after a long and dangerous Fit of Sickness; November 21. 1700. at 3. in the
Afternoon, being a Day of Public THANKSGIVING. Mr. Pemberton's Text, Psalm.
118.27.
AS Joseph let his Brethren see
Simeon both alive, and free:
So JESUS brings forth Samuel,
To tune our hearts to praise Him well.
Thus He with beams of cheerful Light
Corrects the darkness of our Night:
His Grace assists us in this wise
To seize and bind the Sacrifice.
Distressing Fear caused us to Pray October, 8 th. 1700.

God helped us; He will help us aye.
Let Us then our Ebenezer raise,
And honor GOD with endless Praise.
