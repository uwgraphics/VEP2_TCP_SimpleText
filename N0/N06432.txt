PREFACE.
June 22, 1758. My dear Children,
YOU have all immortal souls, something within you which will live forever in
another world, either in a state of eternal happiness or eternal misery; and
since your peace and comfort here, as well as blessedness hereafter, depends in
a great measure upon your good behavior toward God and man, I have drawn up a
few rules for your conduct: -- Endeavor all you can to keep them in your mind,
and pray to God continually for his grace to preserve you from the many
temptations and follies to which childhood and youth are exposed.

Be modest and sober, courteous and free;
Always good to your parents, and all that you see.
The poor and the wretched, pray never despise;
Attend to the counsel of those that are wise.
In your dress and your Actions, let neatness appear;
Let your words all be innocent, kind and sincere.
