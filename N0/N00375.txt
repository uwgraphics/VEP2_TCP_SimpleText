lie open, and are exposed unto, and for Your own safety; We judge it necessary
that You forthwith Surrender, and Deliver up the Government and Fortifications
to be preserved, to be Disposed according to Order and Direction from the Crown
of England, which is suddenly expected may Arrive, promising all Security from
Violence to Your Self, or any other of Your Gentlemen and soldiers in Person
or Estate* or else we are assured they will endeavor the taking of the
Fortifications by Storm, if any opposition be made.
