An Epistle from John Burnyeat to Friends in Pennsilvania;
To be disperced by them to the neighboring Provinces, which for convenience
and dispatch was thought good to be printed, and so ordered by the Quarterly
Meeting of Philadelphia, the 7th of the 4th Month, 1636.
Dear Friends,
IN the universal Spirit of Life and Truth, and of Righteousness and Peace,
does the tender Affection and pure Love of my heart flow forth unto you all,
who are true Lovers of the Power and Holiness of the same, wherein alone it is
that we bear the Image of him whose Name is HOLINESS, and his Nature and Being
is PURITY, so that in that only we do draw and may draw near unto him, and have
fellowship with him, and enjoy his Presence, who is our God, our Life and
Salvation; and therefore in the unity of that whereby we have been quickened,
and through which we live unto him that has quickened us, do I exhort and
beseech you all to mind, with reverence, his secret and sweet Visitations by
his holy Power upon your Spirits, in your hearts, that you feeling that to
apear there, and so through the brightness of its appearing, to destroy him,
whose coming is after the working of Satan with all Power, etc. and with all
deceiveableness of Unrighteousness in them that perish, and not only to appear
to destroy him and his Works, but also to abide with you, and dwell in you, and
to make you his Dewlling Place, and then you being watchful, shall not watch in
vain, because the Lord then will be your Keeper, and then, as one said of old,
He keeping the City, the Watchman watches not in vain. Thus you may see it
fulfilled in your own Hearts unto your own Souls. And so, have comfort and
Confidence with holy David, and with him live above the fear of Evil (though
you might walk through the shadow of Death, as he said) because of the Lords
being with you.

And therefore, Friends, see that you be all mindful of him in his appearing by
his Power and Spirit of Grace in your hearts; and let him have room there, and
not be straightened, or thronged up, or oppressed; for he delights to dwell alone
there, and have the whole heart to himself, and at his own disposing, that he
may fill it with that which he takes pleasure in, and in which only he may be
glorified and honored; and therefore does he require the Heart, saying, My
Son, give me thy heart; And Christ does command, that we should love him with
all our Hearts, etc. So, as I said, let him have room in your hearts, and take
heed that with this World, the Spirit of it, Nature of it, and love to the
things therein, your hearts be not filled, and so taken up, that there be no
room for him, whose coming is with such Glory and Fullness, that he fills all
that are rightly poor and empty, with that Fullness, Richness and Glory, that
there can be no want to them that have him for their Portion and Inheritance,
and so keep single in their hearts before him; but where the heart is filled
with delight in, or desires after other things, out of the Covenant of God
(which is out of his favor) there the Lord will not have delight to dwell,
there is not room; nay, he will not have delight to appear there, because it
will be his grief, and an oppression unto him; was it not so of old, when he
took up his complaint against both Judah and Israel, as you may see Amos 2. how
the Lord pleads with them and threatens them what he would bring upon them for
their Sins that he reckons up against them; and withal, to aggravate their
Crimes (as he might justly do) he also reckons up and tells them what he had
done for them, how he had destroyed the Amorite for their sakes, brought them
out of the Land of Egypt, lead them in the Wilderness, given them the Land of
the Amorits to posses, raised of their Sons to be Prophets, and their Young men
to be Nazarites, etc. but says he unto them, Ye gave my Nazarits Wine to
drink, and commanded my Prophets, saying, Prophecy not: Behold, I am pressed
under you as a Cart is pressed that is full of Sheaves, says he. Hence it may
be understood, that when he has been at work, and has done good by his
glorious Power, who works wonderfully for them (and now in them also) that
believe in his Power; If there be a going from him, and a letting in of another
thing into the Heart, where he should rule and have his dwelling in man, and so
with man, it becomes a grief, and an oppression unto him, and so a provocation
unto him, that he will not always bear it, nor spare man, though he is
long-suffering, as may be seen very fully in that Prophecy of Amos, and more at
large through the Scriptures, which were written for our learning, that we
might be warned, and thereby be stirred up unto diligence, care and
watchfulness, which may tend to our Preservation.

And now, considering those things that were of old, and observing how that in
our Age the Lord has made known his wonted Goodness unto us, even that which
does far exceed the outward Privileges of the outward Israel; for that which
he blesses us withal, is a Possession and enjoyment of a degree of his own
Life (who is the Creator) by which he created all things, which is more than
the enjoyment of the Creature, the loss of which was the great Penalty laid
upon Adam, if he broke the Command, which he having lost, is again restored
unto us through Christ Jesus the second Adam, the Lord from Heaven, which we
having received, do thereby live unto God, and therein serve him.

And so, dear Friends, the thing that is chiefly in my mind unto you, in the
reach of the heavenly Bowels, is to entreat and beseech you all to be tender in
your hearts, and careful over your spirits, that you may not let in nor join
with any thing that will bring grief or oppression upon your Life, or lead you
into the Transgression of the Law thereof: Mind the Exhortation of the Apostle,
Grieve not the Spirit by which you are sealed, etc. And so, as you are careful,
watchful and wise to take heed unto the holy Conduct, and blessed Leadings and
Direction of this Spirit, and the Law thereof, your Souls will dwell in Peace,
and your Feet will tread in a safe Path, even the Path of Peace, and your steps
will not slide, but you will witness what David said of old to be true, The
Righteous shall inherit the Land and dwell therein forever; for, says he, the
Mouth of the Righteous speaks Wisdom, and his Tongue talk of Judgment, the
Law of his God is in his heart, none of his steps shall slide. So here you may
see what it is that keeps from sliding, the Law of God, which is in the heart,
this preserved (...) his Paths.

Oh my dear Friends! you may be happy, yea, we may all be happy, if we be as
careful as we ought, to (...) by this Rule: Oh the sweetness, peace and glory,
that he (...) the hearts of all his People with, that take heed unto his Law!
the Spirit is not grieved, the Life of the Soul is not oppressed; the Soul,
Life or Spirit of man is at ease, and so in the glorious Liberty of the Sons of
God, and so in that state where it can sing unto the Lord and praise him.

And therefore, all of you mind your dwelling and inward Liberty and spiritual
freedom from all the Corruptions of the world and of the flesh, both inwardly
in your selves, and all Temptations from without, that you may reign in the
Dominion of the Seed Christ Jesus forever, and so with him be coheirs of that
heavenly Inheritance and Possession which he has purchased for you.

And so, in the unity of that Life which reigns over all, do I very dearly
salute you all who love the Truth, and in that do I desire that the God of Life
may bear up your spirits by his Power over and a-top of all that would defile
or oppress, that you may be preserved to remain the Sons and Daughters of God
without Rebuke, in and among this crooked and perverse Generation, amongst whom
do you shine as Lights, to the Glory of him who has called you out of Darkness
into his mavelous Light, who over all is worthy of Glory, Honor and
Dominion, World without end.

From your Friend and Brother, in the Truth, John Burnyeat.
