OR A SHORT CATECHISM For the first Entrance of our Chelmesford Children:
Enlarged by A threefold Appendix

By JOHN FISK Pastor of the Church of Christ at Chelmesford in New England.

Thy Children shall be like Olive-plants round about thy Table.

Psalm. 128.3. Those that be planted in the House of the Lord, shall flourish in
the Courts of our God.

Then shall still bring forth fruit in old Age etc:

Psalm. 92.13, 14. Printed by Samuel Green at CAMBRIDG in New England. 1657.

To the Church and Congregation at Chel^sford, Grace and Peace, through Jesus
Christ.
BEloved, What is here presented to Public view is yours: for looking to the
poor-Penman, as Relating to you: to the external moving Cause, as arising
firstly and freely from you, to the End and use as centering in you, to the
reason of the Publishing thereof, as resting with you, and the care and costs,
as to that end expended by you: It must not otherwise be determined but YOVRS.
Which being so* you have saved me the labor, of prefacing on behalf, either
of this so necessary and fruitful an exercise of Catechizing, or of this
present draught: or of publish^ng it. The present encumbrances of our
new-begining you know to have declined me till of late, from the fo^mer, and
mine own inabilities much more from the latter, as being rather desirous to
have made use of some others labors that way, or at leastwise to have acted
mine own f^eble apprehensions in a more private manner amongst our selves. But
God has moved your minds, first to see, and seeing to cause, as it must be as
it is. I shall add only a word or two touching use; 1. The Scripture quotations
in the margent, are so severed by those distinct marks as it is not hard to
discern to which answer they pertayn 2. They are orderly set down (for the
general) as they relate to the several sentences or (...) in the answers. 3.
Where more then one, are mentioned to the same purpose, it is (...) ^^thout
special ca^se, and may serve for help of memory, when we may have occasion to
branch out such a subject, into its particulars. 4. Profitably you may reduce
Promises to their proper heads in the Lords Prayer, and Duties or faylings to
their proper places in the Decalogue. As for the annexing of these with the
Doctrine of the Sacraments, by way of Appendix, It is because the same will
more suit with such capacities as are already entered, then such as are but in
their entrance. I say no more but this, If now you and yours, (as is hoped)
shall gain any Spiritual fruit by these poor weak Travells of mine, I have my
desire: and no small encouragement, in the midst of many
wilde^ness-discouragements. To His Blessing therefore I commit both you and
yours, who is the God of all Blessing: and Rest

Yours in the Lord John Fisk^.

What reasons have you why you do take these words, [For thine is the Kingdom,
the Power and the Glory, for ever,] to point out the thanksgiving and so a
direction for the special matter and manner of that part of prayer?

Answ. 1. Because, Thanksgiving being a part of prayer, must have some place,
in this so perfect a Pattern.

2. Because, in other platforms indicted by the Spirit of God, we find Psalm: 54
56 57* 59 and 61
thanksgiving (sometimes) to close the same. 3. Because, the Phil: 4.6 Col: 4 2
express Rule requires the joining thanksgiving with petition.

Rev^ ^.1^, 17 Rev: 12.10. and 19.1 Jude 24, 25 and in special 1 Chronicles: 29.12,
13
4. Because, this very form of words is mentioned in other Scriptures, by way of

it behooves us to mention and record, in our thanksgivings?

Psalm: 71, 14, 16. Esa. 26.13 1 Chronicles: 16.4.
Answ. To attend the 1 These. 5.17 18.
matter of the several heads of Petition, and so to look at the same good
things, as we are to beg; as the same we are to be thankful for. As the
causall conjunction [For] seems to point out.

Q. Wherein lies the force of that expression [For]?

A. It seems to denote this reason why we should depend upon God in prayer,
for all and every, the several good things before specified: Namely because,
that of God does appear in each of them (enjoyed) as which ought to be, by the
enjoyer, acknowledged to his own praise.

Quest. Where have you any instances of any part of the matter; under the first
head of petitions, acknowledged by way of thankfullnes?

Answ. In Psalm: 34.19, 20. Psalm: 33.18 20. Psalm: 30.11. 2 Timothy: 4.17, 18. PET: 6.


Quest. Is it not sufficient unto true thankfullnes, barely to mention before
God such of these good things, as we profess our selves thankful for?

A. No, for the formal cause, and life of our thanksgivings seems (by our
Saviors direction here) to ly rather in the feeling and affectionate
acknowledgment of that, of the Eternal Kingdom, and Power and Glory, of God;
which is exercised about, and declared in and by, any the said good things, and
the granting and continuing of them.

Q. What may we be then directed to, in those words. (Thine is the Kingdom

A. If not always explicitly, yet implicitly at least, to affect our hearts
thankfully, with those Divine Attributes which shine in such a thing. The
Supreme influence of Divine Providence in ordering ought concerning it, Psalm:
92 2. ibid 4.
and the freenes of Gods Grace in conferring it. Psalm. 94.^^.

Answ. The fullnes of the Lords right, and Sovereignty over us, Psalm: 95.3.7
now interested in such a good thing, Psalm: 115.1.2 3.
or possessed of it. The subjection of all such instruments to him, Psalm:
114.3, 8
as would have withstood it, Psalm: 148. tot
and dependence of ought what ever concurred instrumentally to the effecting of
it, upon Him: Psalm: 93. tot:
And Lastly, but not leastly, the Kingly Mediatourship of Christ, in the
conveyance of this grace of the Covenant unto us.

Quest. What are we taught in those words, (and the Power?)

Answ The hearty-acknowledgment of such a good thing, as we would express our
thankfulness for:

1. As an effect of that Power in God, which is Infinite and unsearchable, Rev:
19.6. Psalm: 111.6 and 145.3, 4 Gen: 17.1.
or of that God, which is Omnipotent or Alsufficient.

2. As it is, not only wrought, Psalm: 79.^1 Psalm: 59.16 Ephe: 1.10
but applied also and continued to us, by the said Power of God.

3. As whereby also the means, Psalm: 145.11. 1 Pet: 1.5 Psalm: 66.3.7.
or second causes conducing ought thereunto are and were enabled, to reach their
ends, and impediments removed. Ephe: 3.20.

enabled, Psalm: 68.34, 35.
to the service of our God.

Quest. What learn you from those words [And the Glory:]

Ephe: 2.12. Psalm: 145.5, 10, 11. 2 These. 1.9. Psalm: 111.3 Rom: 5.22* 23. Psalm:
96.8. Psalm: 105.1, 3
Answ. That what ever Divine perfection, such a thing does speak the glory of,
be taken notice of by us, and be acknowledged in such wise; as both our hearts
be lifted in the exalting the whole Glory of Gods great and Glorious Name: and
others be provoked also to set forth, and to be affected with, the Glory of God.

Q. What gather we from those words [For ever and ever?]

A. As an acknowledgment of God as the same JEHOVAH, Mal: 3.6. Heb. 13.8. Rev:
1 8. 1 Chronicles: 29 14, 16.
from everlasting to everlasting, and that we yet owe our selves, and all we
are and have unto Him: So an avowing, or engaging our selves, and what we have
unto him through his grace for the future. Gen: 28.20* 21.


The Conclusion.
Quest. What is the force of that Conclusive particle [Amen.]

A It is an expression, whereby we both profess that we do and will through
Grace look after our prayers: And do testify as the servent desire, Psalm: 85.8.
1 Cor: 14.16 2 Cor: 1.20. 1 Pet: 4.1^. Rev: 3.14.
so the thankful persuasion of our hearts, of Gods hearing, and accepting our
prayers, in and through Him, who is of all his promises (whereof this prayer is
a Summary Storehouse) the AMEN.

Quest. Why use you Baptism, In particular
in the first place?

A. Not only Mat: 21.25 Exodus: 12.48 Col: 2.11, 12
because it was first ordained as was also Circumcision, Of Baptism.
to which it answers in substance of resemblance But because in order of
nature, our planting or ingraffing into Christ, and our begetting, Rom: 11, 17.
Psalm* 1.3. Psalm: 87.5, 6
breeding and bringing forth of the womb of the Church, do precede our
nourishment and growth therein.

Q. What is the Parents duty, in respect of the Infant to be Baptized?

A. To Mat: ^^:28 Mat: 19.13. Psalm: 51.4. ^ Sam: 12.16 23.

nature, conveyed by them unto it, to commiserate it (...) their souls, Exodus:
20.6. Gen: 17 7.
mourn and sign for it, and to revive their faith in the Covenant, as touching
their seed.

Quest. Is this all?

Answ. Further, they are to Mat: 3.11. 1 Cor: 7.17. Ephesians: 2.11, 12. Ephe: 6.4.
join with the Church in humble confession of its original guilt, Supplication
for the inward and spiritual washing, and thanksgiving for such a means of
strengthening their faith, as touching Gods good will toward it: and so to give
it up unto the Lord, and to his people in him, devoting it to his service, and
engaging the bringing it up to him, and for him.

16.16 1 Cor: 15.29 Gal: 3.27. Rom: 6.3. Mat: 28.19
Baptism, formerly offered to him, to abase himself in the sense of the former
breach of his engagement, and Reverently to attend this Ordinance, improving
the remembrance of his own Baptism to his own spiritual advantage: So all of
them jointly, by humble confession, prayer, and thanksgiving to look up unto
God for the Infant (or who other) presented to Baptism.

Quest. What is the Ministers duty?

Answ. As to understand so to teach the doctrine and use of this Ordinance, 2
Cor: 3.^. Mat: 28.27. Exodus: 40.9 Mat: 3.11. 1 Timothy: 4.4. and 3.15.

A. As well, of Col: ^.11.12. with 1 Cor: 7.14. 1 Pet: 3.21. Deuteronomy: 30.6 Ephe:
2.5.
Circumcision of old. And to be Baptized, or Circumcised, outwardly, or
inwardly, no external action of the receiver is necessarily pre-required, he
being properly rather a patient therein: and also there being no word in the new
Testament, Gen: 17.11, 12.
which makes void that former appointment of God, of setting the initiating
Seal of the Covenant upon such.

Quest. To what use serves it?

A. To Gal: 6.10 1 Cor: 12.23. John 15: 2 Rom: 4.11 Gen: 17.11. Heb* 12.^5
Signify, and seal, its visible relation to Christ his body the Church; and

14.21.
set forth the full nourishment of the soul: and this neither bread, nor wine
apart would do, the one being the staff of Life, the other the cherisher of the
spirits.

Quest. What are we to observe, as touching the outward acts of the Supper?

A. The acts on the Ministers part and on the receivers.

A. The setting of Christ apart for suffering, and death and suffering of
Christ accordingly, Acts 2.23.36 1 Cor. 21.26 John 6, 51
and the free communication of the benefits thereof to so many as do receive him.

Quest. Whence is it, that from Christ is our spiritual support, and strength
in grace, as well as our first being in grace?

Answ. From hence, Heb: 9.15 1 Timothy: 2.5. 2 Cor: 1.20 Col: 3.11 (...) 2.1^. John
10.10.
that He is appointed and has undertaken to be the alone Mediator of the
Covenant, and so the All in all of the souls-happines.

Quest. How is Christ propounded to us in the Supper, as the soul-nourishment?

John 2 John 1:17: and 17.11 Es^y 63.8, 4. Ephe: 4.16 Psalm: 73.26 1 Cor: 15.58
manner of Spiritual supply, to any of the wants of the soul as concerns its
health, growth, stability or fruitfulnes in grace.

Quest. What do those acts of the receiver, in taking, eating and drinking, ^he
Elements set forth?

Answ. How Faith-Sacramental Esaias 1.29. Luke 5.^^ Esaias 25.6* 7, ^ Psalm: 118.24*
Esa. 55.2
apprehends and applies Christ, al-along to the souls spiritual nourishment:
For it consenting to the word of Gods promise and tender, Tit: 1.15. Rev: 3.16.
Jer: 2.13.
and submitting in obedience to his command, does lay hold upon and improve
Christ, to all needful supplies of Grace, spiritual strength, and life, and
gathers out the sweetness and comfort of all.

Quest. What is the end and use of the Supper?

Answ. 1. To confirm John 10.9 and 15.4. Heb: 9.16.
