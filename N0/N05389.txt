A New Version of THE PSALMS OF DAVID Fitted to the Tunes used in the CHURCHES.

With several HYMNS, OUT OF THE Old, and New, TESTAMENT.

By JOHN BARNARD, Pastor of a Church in Marblehead.

BOSTON: N. E. Printed by J. DRAPER, for T. LEVERETT, in Cornhill. 1752.

PREFACE.
THOUGH the New England Version of (...) Psalms of David, in M^^tre, is genera^^
very good, and few of the same Age may be compared with it; yet the Flux of
Languages has rendered several Phrases in it ^bsolete, and the Mode of
Expression in va^^^us Places less acceptable: for which Reasons an Amendment,
or New Version, has been long, and greatly, desired, by the most judicious
among us.

After long waiting for the Performance of some-mo^^-masterly Pen, and upon
repeated Desires, I have ventured to employ all the spa^e Time of near upon the
last Three Years of my advanced Age, (this Day, through the Forbearance of God,
completing my seventieth Year,) in composing a New Version, suited to the
Tunes used in our Churches, which, by Divine Assistance is now finished.

My great Care has been to (...) as close to the Original as I could, without a
literal Translation; to preserve the Sentiments of the sweet Singer of Israel;
and to make, what seemed (...), plain and easy: And all in a Style be^^^ing the
Majesty of the sacred Writings, and adapted to the Capacity of our Christian
Assem^^ies; neither in such Flights of Poetry as soar (...) them, nor yet so
low, I trust, as to (...).

I have made free to borrow some Expressions, (...) sometimes a Line or two,
from any Authors ^ ^ave met with, who have gone before me in this Work: and
thankfully acknowledge the great Obligations I am under to the Reverend Mr.
Mather, and Mr. Byles, for the just Corrections, and ready Approbation, they
have bestowed upon this Version.

If I have so far succeeded in my Attempt, as to render the Psalmody any thing
more delightful to a devout Singer, and edifying to the Church of God, the
great End of all my Care and Industry is answered* and let God have all the
Praise.

Marblehead, November. 6. 1751. John Barnard.

THE PSALMS of DAVID.
PSALM I. FIRST BOOK.
THrice blessed the Man, who never thin^^ (...)
To walk as wicked Men advise (...)
To stand in Sinners Way, nor sit
With those who God, and Man, despi^^

By sacred Writ, his sweet Delight,
Through all the Labors of the Day;
And meditates thereon by Night.

Yield timely Fruit, a vast Increase;
So in fresh Verdure he abides,
And God his handy work will bless.

Shall no such Favor with him find;
For God will blast them, and their Cause,
And whirl, as Chaff, before the Wind.

The Wicked shall not stand the Light*
Mix with the Righteous shall not they*
Nor any formal Hypocrite.

Will then applaud, the just Man's Way;
But who his Name and Word abuse,
Shall feel his Wrath, and melt away.
PSALM II.
WHy do the Heathen furious rage,
And in such Tumults join?
Why do the People madly storm,
And such vain Schemes design?
Gentile Kings unite their Strength,
And Israel's Priests contrive;
Against the Lord they bend their Force,
Against his CHRIST they strive.

"Shall we them Homage pay;
"We'll never submit to their hard Yoke,
"We'll cast their Cords away.

With a disdainful Smile;
The Lord, their feeble Strength derides,
Their Malice, and their Guile.

And thunder in their Ears;
While hovering Vengeance fills their Souls,
With dreadful vexing Fears.

"On Zion's sacred Plot:

"This Day I Thee begot.

"For thine Inheritance;
"Through utmost Bounds of Earth, thy Sway
"Shall gloriously advance.

"As with an Iron Rod;
"Them, as a Potter's Vessel, dashed,
"In Pieces spread abroad.

Earth's Judges, his mild Voice:

Him tremble, and rejoice.

You in your Way surprise;
His Wrath's but kindling yet: they are blessed
Whose Trust on him relies.
PSALM II. 2d Meetre.
WHy do the Heathen madly rage,
And in assembled Tumults join?
Why do rash People thus engage,
And such vain fruitless Schemes design?

And Rulers their deep Plots contrive;
Against the Lord they vent their Spite,
Against his CHRIST they boldly strive.

"Shall we our Homage to them pay?
"We'll never be Slaves to their Commands,
"We'll cast their servile Cords away.

Beholds with a disdainful Smile;
The Lord who rules above the Sky,
Derides their Strength, their Rage, and Guile.

While Vengeance in his Thunder rowls;
His hot Displeasure on them breaks,
And sore Vexation fills their Souls.

"Of mine anointed King most sure,
"On Zion's sacred Hill alone;
"There it forever stands secure.

"'It Is past in Heaven, and changes not;
"Thou art my Son, ( Jehovah said)
"This very Day I Thee begot.

"Inherit thou the Heathen Lands;
"Through utmost Bounds of Earth receive
"Subjection to thy just Commands.

"As with a massy Iron Rod;
"Thou shall in Pieces dash thy Foes,
"As Potters Vessels spread abroad.

Ye Judges of the Earth, his Voice:

Before him tremble, and rejoice.

Ye perish, when his Anger glows;
Lest kindling Wrath your Crimes repay,
Blessed all in him their Trust repose.
PSALM. III.
O Lord, my Troublers great are grown,
And many up against me rise,

And God all Help to him denies.

And thy Defense is round me spread;
Thou art my Glory; I shall see
Thee high, in Honor, raise my Head.

To God I made, in like Distress,
He, from his holy Hill, did hear
My Voice, and all my Fears suppres^.

My quiet Sleep, secure by Night;
And in the Morning safe awake*
O Lord, supported by thy Might.

Or of thy timely Help despair*
Though, round encamped (...) me, laid,
Ten Thousands of the People are.

For all my Foes have felt thy Str^^k
Full in the Face; and by Thee have
The Teeth of wicked Men been broke.

As his peculiar Right, pertains;
On those thou chusest for thine own,
Thy Blessing ever sure remains.
PSALM IV.
O God, my Righteousness who art,
Whenever I call, give Ear;
Thou have enlarged me when distressed,
Have Mercy, now, and hear.

My Glory turn to Shame?
How long will ye love Vanity
And me with Lies defame?

The Godly for his own;
The Lord will hear, when unto him,
I make my humble Moan.

But commune with thy Heart,
While resting on thy Bed, and learn
Contentment's noble Art.

Free from all consciou^ Blame*
Then confidently put your Trust
Upon Iehov^h's Name,

Who Will cause us Good to see?
The chearing Light, Lord, of thy Face,
Let (...) us lifted be.

More lasting, and divine,
Than they can boast, whose fruitful Years
Increase their Corn and Wine.

And sweet Repose will take;
For me in Confidence to dwell
Thou, Lord, alone, do make.
PSALM V.
UNTO my Words, O Lord, give Ear;
My secret Meditation weigh:

My King, my God, to Thee I Will pray.

My humble Voice, thou, Lord, shall hear;
To Thee, I Will, with the rising Sun,
Lift up mine Eyes, and make my Prayer.

Neither shall Evil dwell with Thee;

Thou hat'st who work Iniquity.

That raise, and spread, pernioious Lies;
The Lord abhors such as employ
Themselves in Blood, and Guile devise.

Again shall to thy House (...);
And now, toward the holy Place,
I look, and worship, in thy Fe^r*

My spiteful Foes observant grow;
Make plain, and right, before my Fac^,
The Way in which I ought to go.

Their inward Part's perversely wrong*
Their Throat is like an open (...)*
They basely flatter with their Tongue*

By their own Counsels let them fall*
Them, for their many Crimes reje^^*
For they are hardened Rebels (...)*

And loud, with Shouts, their Joy (...)*
For thou will their Protection ^e* (...)
Let them rejoice that love thy Name (...)

Wilt make thy Blessing to extend;
As with a Shield, thy Favor, them
Shall, round on every Side defend.
PSALM VI.
O Lord, when thou do me rebuke*
Let not thine Anger rise;
Nor thy Displeasure Fury grow,
When thou do me chastise.

Weakness ^y Strength restrains;
O Lord, my Health, and Ease restore*
My Bones are racked with Pains.

They even dis^^st my (...);
But, Lord how long (...) I endure,
Ever I (...).

Raise my (...) Soul;
And for thy tender M^rcy's S^ke,
O save, and make me whole.

There none record thy Name;
For who can in the silent Grave,
With Thanks, thy Praise proclaim?

The Bed on which I lay,
Each Night, to swim with flowing Tears;
And bathe my Couch by Day.

The Vigor of mine Eyes;
They Are waxed dim, and old, because
Of all mine Enemies.

Nor in vain Plots rejoice;
Because the Lord will sure regard,
My Tears, and mournful Voice.

My present Suit will hear;
The Lord will graciously receive,
And answer, all my Prayer.

With sore Vexation fraught;
Yea, blush, and rage, to see their Schemes,
To sudden Ruin brought.
PSALM VII.
O Lord, my God, in (...) alone,
I do my Trust repose;
Deliver me from cruel (...),
And save me from my Foes.

My helpless Soul should tear;
Lest it in Pieces he shall rend,
When no Deliv'rer's near.

As falsely they accused;
If ever such Guilt has stained my H^^ds,
That him I have abused;

Who was at Peace with me;
(Yea, I Have delivered him that is
My causless Enemy;)

Take it, and fill his Lust;
My Life tread down to Earth, and lay
Mine Honor in the Dust.

Mine Enemies Rage restrain;
Awake, for me the Judgment grant
Thou did of old ordain.

And to thy Courts repair;
For their Sake therefore, O return,
And shine in Glory there.

As righteous is my Case,
So judge me, Lord, and as my Heart
Is right before thy Face.
Second PART.

But stablish (...);
For, righteous Lord, their Heart, and Reins,
Search thoroughly thou do.

He Will save from spiteful Foes.

He daily angry grows.

God will his Vengeance show;
He now has whet his glittering Sword,
Has fixed, and bent his Bow.

Ready prepared ly;
And at fierce Persecutors Breasts,
His pointed Arrows fly.

To work Iniquity;
He Mischief long conceives, and yet,
At last, brings forth a Lie.

He dig'd it deep, and wide;
But in the Ditch his Hands had formed,
Did unexpected slide.

On his own Head at last;
His violent Dealings shall come down,
And on his Crown be cast.

For all his righteous Ways;
And to the Name of God most high,
I Will sing my Songs of Praise.
PSALM VIII.
O Lord, our Lord, in all the Earth,
How excellent's thy Name!
Who have the Heavens far above,
Established thy Fame.

Ordained have thy Praise;
Which puts to silence impious Tongues
The Self Avenger stays.

Formed by thy Finger's Might.
O^ view the Moon, and glittering Stars,
Ordained to rule the Night:

Do bear him still in Mind?
And what the Son of Man, whom thou
To visit art so kind?

Than Angels round thy Throne;
With Glory thou did him adorn,
And with high Honors crown.

Dominion's regal Seat;
And all Things in Subjection put,
Beneath his royal Feet:

And Birds that beat the Air;
The Fish that cleave the briny Sea,
And all that passes there.

With thine unrivaled Fame?
Through all the Earth, from Pole to Pole,
How excellent's thy Name.
PSALM IX.
WIth all my (...), ^^^rnal God,
I Will (...) thy Praise;
I Will show forth all thy wondrous Works,
Of Judgment, and of Grace.

In Thee I will rejoice (...)
O thou Most-high! Praise to thy Name,
I Will sing with cheerful Voice.

And put their Troops to flight;
With Terror, at thy Presence ^truck
They fall, and perish quite.

And made my Cause thine own;
In Righteousness thou judged have,
From thine imperial Throne.

And laid the Wicked waste;
Thou have cast out their Name as vile,
Them evermore disgraced.

To utter End is brought
Their Cities thou have overthrown,
Their Name is quite forgot.

Remains the living One;
Who, from of Old, for Judgment has
Prepared his royal Throne.

Shall judge in Righteousness;
Unbi^s'd Judgment he shall give
To greater, and the less*

Thy Judge (...)
Above (...)
He puffs (...)

"My Sta^e no (...)*
"For I, secure from (...)*
"Shall be (...)

With gross (...)*
His (...) Tongue (...)*
And Injuries disguise.

Near Village^* (...)*
With watchful Ey^^, against the (...)
To slay the Innocent.

He waits to catch the Poor*
And those he draws within his Net,
Does eagerly devour.

In humble Postures all;
That, in his strong devouring Jaws,
The Poor may heedless fall.

Or turns away his Sight;
And never will behold his Rage,
His Violence, and Spite.
Second PART.

O Lord, lift up thy Hand;
Forget not thy poor suffering Saints,
Defense for them command.

With In^^^^, God contemn?
And proudly say, "Thou will not Care,
"Or, wh^t t^^y do condemn?

With strong H^^d to reward*
The Poor commits himself to Thee,
Thou art the Orphan's Guard.

Their evil Arts confound;
Search (...), and punish, their vile Deeds*
Till there no more be found.

Whose Kingdom ever stands;
The Heathen Tribes are rooted out,
And perished, from thy Lands,

Have still been wont to hear;
Thou will prepare their Heart, and then
Vouchsafe a gracious Ear.

Of poor and fatherless;
That so the Man of Earth no more,
With Terrors may oppress.
PSALM XI.
I Firmly on the Lord rely;
How can you thus my Soul advise?
To some safe Place for Refuge fly.
As timorous Bird to Mountain flies.

And fix their Arrows on the String,
To shoot, and with a secret Blow,
The innocent to Ruin bring;

Justice, and Truth, are overthrown,
The Just can find no safe Retreat,
What shall by righteous Men be done?

The Lord in Heaven has fixed his Throne;
From thence with piercing Eyes surveys
Men's Sons, and trys them every one.

Afflict, and try his gracious State;
But those who Vice, and Rapine, love*
He from his very Soul does hate.

On guilty Heads he will swiftly shower
And burning Tempest's raging Pain*
Into their Cup of Vengeance pour.

His tender Love will free impart;
With Beams of Favor he beholds
The Man, who is upright in Heart.
PSALM XII.
HElp Lord; the godly Man decays*
And quits the hated Ground*
And faithful Men, in these our Days,
Are very rarely found.

Deceives his Friend with Lies;
With flattering Lips, and double Heart,
They speak in close Disguise.
Jehovah surely will, ever long,
The flattering Lips cut off;
With the proud, threatening, boasting Tongue,
Which does profanely scoff.

"Prevailing Force afford;
"What sure; are not our Lips our own?
"Who over u^ is Lord?

"Now (says the Lord,) I Will rise:
"From his Oppressors give him Rest,
"But all his Foes despise.

And pure from Fraud abide;
As Silver through the Furnace past,
And sev'n Times purified.

Thou strictly wilt observe;
And ever, from this faithless Race,
Them carefully preserve.

And greatly multiply;
When vilest Men of Fraud, and Pride,
Are raised up on high.
PSALM XIII.
HOw long will thou forget me, Lord?
Forever shall thy Promise fail:
How long before thy Face afford
One Beam of Light, through this dark Vail?

And daily Sorrows wound my Heart?
How long shall my proud Foes insult,
And over me act the Tyrant's Part?

Hear, O my God, the Cries I make;
Mine Eyes, enlighten with thy Grace,
L^st Death's deep Sleep me overtake.

Should say, against him Iv'e prevailed;
And those that trouble me rejoice,
To see my steadfast Hopes have failed.

My Trust is ever firmly stayed;
Therefore my Heart with Gladness springs,
In Prospect of thy promised Aid.

I Will humbly to the Lord address;
For he, according to his Grace,
Dealt well with me in my Distress.
PSALM XIV.
THe Fool, in's Heart, says, there is no God;
They so corrupt are grown:
Abominable Works they do,
That does Good there is none.

From Heaven, his high Abode;
To see if Reason bore the Sway,
And led them up to God.

They filthy were, and base;
Not one, the Paths of Virtue trod,
Of all that sinful Race.

And far from Reason stray,
That they my People eat as Bread,
And God no Homage pay?

With most amazing Fear;
When God, to plead the just Man's Cause,
In Vengeance shall appear.

Reproaching ye despise;
Because the Lord his Refuge is,
Where he for Shelter flie^.
Zion Safety send*
And back his Captives bring;
Jacob should, with loud Peals, rejoice,
Thy Praise glad Israel sing.
PSALM XV.
WHo, Lord, shall to thy Courts repair,
And find a gracious Welcome there?
Who, in thy holy Hill above,
Shall dwell forever in thy Love?

From Rules of Justice never st^ays;
Whose every Word does Truth impart,
And speaks the Meaning of his Heart.

Nor seeks his Neighbors Fame to blot;
Who entertains no ill Report,
Nor spreads it to his Neighbor's hurt;

But all that fear the Lord does prize;
Whose Oath* and Promise, firmly bind,
Nor Hopes, nor Fears, shall change his Mind:

Nor Bribes against the harmless takes:
The Man does thus, by God approved,
Stands firm, and never shall be moved.
PSALM. XVI.
O Mighty God, preserve thou me*
From all my restless Foes;
For Succor, to thine Arms, I slay,
My Trust in Thee repose.

Thou art my Lord alone;
No Benefit's to Thee conveyed,
By all the Good I Have done.

My Goodness may extend;
Those excellent, with great Delight*
I Will succor, and befriend.

Their Sorrows shall abound;
Their Blood Drink-Off'rings I Will not pour,
Nor Names my Lips shall sound.

He does my Part ordain;
He richly sills my flowing Bowl,
And does my Lot maintain.

In a most pleasant Seat;
My Heritage is fallen, where
All Blessings jointly meet.

Whose Counsel guides me right;
Sweetly may inmost Thoughts he sways,
In each revolving Night.

As present, in his Love;
At my Right Hand he will Strength afford,
That naught shall me remove.

My Tongue a cheerful Strain*
My dying Flesh secure shall rest,
In Hope to rise again.

Nor leave me in the Grave;
But, from the least Corruption free,
Thy holy One wilt save.

Joys in Perfection glow
Before thy Face, at thy Right Hand,
Immortal Pleasures flow.
PSALM XVII.
THe Rights of Justice hear, O Lord,
Attend unto my Cry;
A gracious Ear my Prayer afford,
From Lips which do not lie.

Impartially proceed;
The Rights, and Justice, of my Cas^,
Let thine Eyes closely heed.

In the still Night's Recess;
And nothing found; I fixed abide
My Mouth shall not transgress.

Yet, taught by thy pure Word,
The Paths of them that would destroy,
I ever have abhorred.

In thy most righteous Way*
So shall my Steps unmoved be,
And from thy Paths never stray.

O God, I Thee beseech,
To my Request incline thy Ear.
And hear my humble Speech.
Second PART.

Who Trust in Thee repose,
From all that up against them stand;
Thy wondrous Love disclose.

Hide me beneath thy Wing:

And me to Death would bring.

What Malice does devise.

And couch with watchful Eyes;

When greedy for their Prey;
Or a young Lion lurking sets,
In some close covert Way.

And cast him down, O Lord;
At liberty, O, set my Soul,
From wicked Men, thy Sword.

From worldly Men me save;
Who in this present Life, and World,
Their fading Portion have
With thy hid Treasures, thou do fill,
Their Bellies: and their Race,
Numerous and pampered, Heir by Will
The Bulk of their Increase.

Thy smiling Face I Will see;
And waking, with thine Image blessed,
Shall satisfied be.
PSALM XVIII.
THee, Lord, my Strength, I Will dearly love.

My Fortress strong, where safe I prove;
My Savior from mine Enemy:
My God, my powerful Aid, from whence
My steady Trust securely flows;
My guarding Shield, my sure Defense,
My Tower, above the Reach of Foes.

O Lord, my Prayer I Will make to Thee;
(Who worthy art of all our Praise,)
So, from my Foes, I saved shall be.

While Death it is Terrors round me spread;
As when impetuous Torrents roll,
Ungodly Men made me afraid.

Entangling me encompassed round;
Death's Snares, about me close beset,
And how to 'scape no Way I found.

With mournful Voice, I then preferred;
Who, from his Throne, bowed down his Ear*
And my Request, in Mercy, heard.
Second PART.

And dreadful Trembling on it seized:
The Hills Foundations moved were,
And shook, for God was sore displeased.

Thick Clouds of smoke; His Mouth out-threw
Devouring Fire; in midst of those,
Hot Thunderbolts around him flew.

In solemn Pomp marched from hi^ Seat*
Darkness, from his imperial Throne,
Was spread beneath his royal Feet.

That clave with speed the yielding Air;
The Winds, obsequious to their God,
Him, swift, on strongest Pinions, bear.

For his Pavilion, Mists arise;
He, for a Covering, round him threw,
His thick Clouds from the nether Skies.

His thick Clouds, then, in haste retire;
They fell, dissolved, a dismal Rout,
In Showers of Hail, and Storms of Fire.

From Heaven, the En'my struck with Dread;
The Almighty spoke with angry Voice,
And Hail, and Fire, the Terrors spread.

Which broke the Forces of the Foe*
His pointed Lightenings swiftly fly,
And soon complete their Overthrow.

The torn World it is Foundations showed;
For, Lord, thy Vengeance did appear,
Fierce Blasts from thy hot Nostrils flowed.
Third PART.

He drew me from the Waters great.

Too strong for me, who me did hate.

But God sustained me by his Might.

Saved me, in whom he took Delight.

And recompense my upright Heart.

Nor wickedly from God depart.

None of his Laws my Soul disdained.

And from my darling Sin refrained.

According to my Righteousness;
And as he saw my Hands were free
From Wrong, my Griefs did soon redress.

"And just to them that Justice love.

"To Froward just Returns shall be.

"But haughty Looks in Dust debase.

"And turn my Darkness into Light.

My numerous Foes, an armed Host:
Thus, guarded by my God, I flew,
And s^al'd their Walls, their greatest Boast.

Thy Word, O Lord, is thoroughly tried;
Thou, as a Shield, wilt them surround,
Whose steadfast Hopes on Thee abide.
Fourth PART.
Jehovah then alone,
"Shall we, as God, adoring own?
"What Rock of Strength shall us defend,
"But God? who is our constant Friend.

And brings to pass my just Intent.

And strong to climb the steep Ascent.

To manage War, with dext'rous Skill;
My strengthened Arm can break the Bow,
That Is made of well-wrought tempered Steel*

Of thy Salvation, in my Strait;
Thy Right Hand still has me upheld,
Thy Gentleness has made me great.

My Feet never slipped, nor were decoyed.

And turned not till they were destroyed.

Their vanquished Force no more made Head;
They prostrate fell, all round about,
And, slain, beneath my Feet were spread.

The Heat of Battle to sustain;
Thou have subdued my Foes at length,
And made them stoop to my just Reign.

To slay my Haters on the Spot.

Yea, to the Lord, who answered not.

Their mighty numerous Troops I beat,
Their Corpse, with great Contempt designed,
I cast, as Mire, in the open Street.
Fifth PART.

And made the Rebels own my Sway;
Over neighboring Heathen placed me Head,
And Realms unknown shall me obey.

Strangers submiss shall prostrately.

And frightened from their Coverts fly.

Exalted be my Savior God.

Subjects whole Nations to my Rod.

Raised me, and wast my sure Defense,
From all that up against me rise;
Even from the Man of Violence.

And Voice, shall celebrate thy Fame:
To heathen Lands thy Acts impart,
And Praises sing unto thy Name.

Shows his Anointed signal Grace;
Which evermore afresh shall spring,
To David, and his promised Race.
PSALM XIX.
Through all the Heavens, thy Glory, Lord,
Does admirably shine;
The starry Firmament declares
Thy Power, and Skill, Divine*

Discourses of thy Fame;
And Night, to Night, does clearly show
The Knowledge of thy Name.

Through the terraqueous Frame;
The Voice of these would still be heard,
And wide thy Praise proclaim.

Throughout the World* their Words;
In them a rich adorned Tent
He for the Sun affords.

Bright as a Bridgroom clad;
And Champion like, proud of his Strength,
To run his Race is glad.

Pursues his Western Course!
And all Things in his Circle feels
His Heat's reviving Force.
Second PART.

And daily Strength supplies;
His Testimonies faithful are,
And make the Simple wise.

With Joy they fill the Heart;
The Lord's Commands are perfect pure*
Light to the Eyes impart.

Forever does abide;
His Judgments are established Truth,
And wholly justified.

Refined with utmost Skill*
Than Virgin Honey swee^^^ (...),
That from the Combs distill.

They friendly warning give;
And they who strictly keep thy Word,
Thence great Rewards receive.

He er^^ from Paths Divine;
From all my secret Faults, O cleanse
This guilty Soul of mine.

Never let them rule over me;
Then upright, and from grosser Crimes,
I purified shall be.

And (...) of my Heart,
Delight thine Eyes: thou, Lord, my Strength,
And my Redeemer art.
PSALM XX.
THe Lord attend to thy Request,
And hear thee when thou art distressed:
The Name of Jacob's God defend,
And be to thee a constant Friend.

From his most holy dwelling Place;
Thee ^trengthen, and support thy Throne*
From Zion, Seat of his Renown,

And to thy Sacrifice be kind.

And all thy wholesome Counsels bless.

Our Banners, with triumphant Voice,
In our God's Name, we'll high erect*
The Lord all thy Desires respect.

Will his Anointed safe preserve;
From Heaven he will hear, and Help com^^nd,
With saving Strength of his Right Hand (...)

And some in Horses, trained for War*
But we our God will call to Mind,
In whom alone we Safety find.

While we, in Triumph, keep the (...)

Hear, when we call, or Praises sing*
PSALM XXI.
THe King shall in thy Strength rejoi^^
O Lord; what Shouts of Praise
Shall he, to Heaven, with cheerful Voice,
In thy Salvation raise?

Thou with thy Favors blessed;
Nor have refused to impart
His Lips devout Request.

(...) unsought Blessings shed;
(...) a Crown of purest Gold
(...) his royal Head.

Thy Grant did far extend.
(...) Length of Days thou did bestow,
And Life that never should end.

His Glory to be great;
With Majesty have him arrayed;
And Honors round him wait.

Thou made him, through thy Grace,
His Heart with flowing Gladness springs,
From thy reviving Face.
Second PART.

His steadfast Trust retains.
Through Favor of the highest One,
His Kingdom firm remains.

Who dare thy Power withstand;
Thy Right-hand's Vengeance falls on those,
Who hate thy just Command.

Of Wrath, shall be their Doom;
Thine Anger, Lord, shall them devour,
And dreadful Fire consume.

From Earth's extended Face;
And from Men's Sons, wilt wholly root
Their numerous guilty Race.

Their Hearts did Mischief form;
But thou did blast their vile Intent,
Which they could never perform.

Therefore thou shall them place;
Thine Arrows on their Strings prepare,
And level at their Face.

Thy Strength in Glory raise;
So we will sing thy wondrous Name,
Thy mighty Power will praise.
PSALM XXI. 2 d Meetre.
THe King, in thy Strength,
Is joyful, O Lord;
In thy saving Health
Does greatly rejoice.

Thou do him afford;
And have not witholden
The Suit of his Voice.

Thou do him prevent;
And fix on his Head
A Crown of pure Gold.

Kind Answer thou sent;
And Length of Days gav'st him*
Which never grow old.

Have spread wide his Fame;
High Honors him clothed,
And Majesty crowned.

Most blessed proclaim;
And make him most glad, with
Thy Beams shining round.

His Trust does repose;
The Favor of God
Confirms his high State.

And punish thy Foes:
Thy Right Hand, in Vengeance,
Crush them that Thee hate.

Thy Wrath shall them make;
Thine Anger, O Lord,
Consume them in Flames.

Thou wholly shall take;
And root out from Mankind,
Their Seeds hateful Names.

And Mischief devised;
Which, blasted by Thee,
Could never take Place.

Thou have them surpised;
And levelled thine Arrows
Direct at their Face.

Throughout the whole Land;
His Strength still appear,
His Glory to raise:
So will we sing joyful
The Works of thy Hand;
And thy mighty Power,
Forever will praise.
PSALM XXII.
MY God, my God, wherefore have thou
Forsaken me? O why
So far from helping me, and deaf
To all my mournful Cry?

But thou have no Regard;
I am not silent in the Night,
And yet I am not heard.

Who do great Pleasure take
To dwell, where thankful Israel praise,
And sacred Offerings make.

And did Deliverance gain.

Their Trust was not in vain.

So vilely am I prized;
Reproached by Men of greatest Name*
By vulgar ones despised.

Their Scoffs upon me play:
They gape, and mock, and shake their Heads,
And thus deriding say:

"That he would take his Part;
"Now let him save him, if he be
"The Darling of his Heart.

Making my Birth thy Care;
When on my Mother's Breast I hung,
Thou did support me there.

When mine first spread abroad;
Thou, from my Infant-Days, have been
My Guardian, and my God.
Second PART.

For none to help is found*
Bashan's Breed,
About beset me round.

As Lions for their Prey.

My Heart dissolves away.

My Tongue cleaves to my Jaws;
Down to the Dust of Death, my Life,
By thy sore Chast'ning, draws.

Base Crowds around me meet;
With unrelenting furious Rage,
They pierce my Hands, and Feet.

They staring me review.

Lots for my Vesture threw.

But have to succor me.

The Power of Dogs set free.

Deliverance to me send;
And from the Horns of the Unicorn,
O hear, and me defend.

The Glories of thy Name;
Amid'st the Congregation great,
I will thy Praise proclaim.
Third PART.

From Jacob who proceed;
Him glorify, and reverence him,
O all ye Isr'el's Seed.

From the afflicted's Grief,
Nor hid his Face from him; but heard
His Cries, and sent Relief.

Assembly meets to pray;
Before his Saints, that fear his Name,
The Vows I Have made, I Will pay.

And Thanks to God shall give:
They that uprightly seek him shall
In Joys immortal, live.

And turn unto the Lord;
All Kindreds of the Nations shall,
To worship Thee, accord.

To God alone, pertains;
He sov'rain Ruler, uncontrol'd,
Over all the Nations reigns.

And who in Dustly low,
Who cannot keep alive his Soul,
Before his Face shall bow.

Which God for his will own.

And Wonders he has done.
PSALM XXIII.
JEhovah my kind Shepherd i^,
He does my Wants supply;

He makes me down to ly.

He mildly does reclaim;
And leads me on in righteous Paths,
For the Honor of his Name.

No Evil will I fear;
Thy Rod directs, and Staff defends,
For thou art with me there.

In Presence of my Foes;
Thou do my Head with Oil anoint,
My Cup it overflows.

Attend me all my Days;
My fixed Abode forever, Lord,
Shall be thy House of Praise.
PSALM XXIII. 2 d Meetre.
THe gracious Lord is still, to me,
A Shepherd kind, and faithful Guide;
Whatever my Wants demand, shall be
By his indulgent Care, supplied.

He feeds, and makes me take my Rest;
He leads me to the silent Stream,
Or Pool which living Springs have blessed.

He does restore, by sov'rain Grace;
For his Name's Sake, he gently leads
Me in the Paths of Righteousness.

No threatening Dangers will I fear;
For thou art with me, Lord, to guide
Thy Rod, and Staff, to comfort, there.

In sight of all my spiteful Foes;
Thou do anoint with Oil my Head,
My Cup with Blessings overflows.

Shall surely crown my future Days;
Therefore I Will make my fixed Abode,
Lord, in thy House of Prayer, and Praise.
PSALM XXIV.
THis Globe of Earth, with all it is Stores,
The greater, and the less;
The World, and them that dwell therein,
Jehovah does possess.

It Is sure Foundations laid;
His powerful Word, it firm, unmoved,
On rolling Floods, has staid.

The Mount of God ascend?
Who, standing in his holy Place,
Before him shall attend?

Whose Heart is pure from Stains;
Whose Soul's not raised to Vanity,
And a false Oath disdains.

Abundantly will bless:
And God, his Savior, will him crown
With perfect Righteousness.

Shall view thy blessed Abode;
Who now, with true Devotion, seek
The Face of Jacob's God.
Second PART.

Immortal Doors give Way;
That, with his Graces, enter in,
The King of Glory may.

The strong and mighty God,
The Lord in Battle mighty, he
In Triumph glorious rode.

Eternal Doors give Way;
That enter, with his Train of Saints,
The King of Glory may.

The Lord of Host, renowned
Through all the Realms of Heaven and Earth.
He Is King of Glory crowned.
PSALM XXIV. 2 d Meetre.
THis spacious Globe of Earth,
It Is Treasures, great and small*
With them that in it dwell, our God
Is sov'rain Lord of all.

It Is firm Foundations laid;
Upon the rolling Floods, it is Base,
He unremov'd has staid.

Shall happily ascend?
And who, within his holy Place
Before him shall attend?

And Heart from Stains is pure;
Whose Soul's not raised to Vanity,
Nor can false Oaths endure.

Receive the fullest Bliss;
The God of his Salvation shall
Him cloth with Righteousness.

This is the happy Race;
Whose pious Souls devoutly seek
The God of Jacob's Face.
Second PART.

Immortal Doors give way;
That, with his Graces, enter in,
The King of Glory may.

The Lord whose Powers excel;
Who comes in Triumph, laden with
The Spoils of Earth, and Hell.

Eternal Doors give way;
That enter, with his Train of Saints,
The King of Glory may.

The Lord of Hosts I sing;
That Lord whom Heaven, and Earth adore;
It Is he is Glory's King.
PSALM XXV.
TO Thee, O God, I lift my Soul;

O let me not be put to shame,
Nor triumph let my Foes.

Be with Disgrace oppressed;
But pour Contempt upon them all,
Who causeless have transgressed.


For thou art my Salvation's God;
All Day I wait on Thee.

Thy Kindness manifold;
And let thy Mercies freely flow;
They Have ever been of old.

From riper Crimes me free;
In Mercy, for thy Goodness sake,
O Lord, remember me.

Instructs the Souls that stray:

The humble teach his Way.

Exceeding kind, and true;
To such as keep his Covenant,
And his Commandments do.
Second PART.

O Lord, for thy Name's sake.

The Way that he should take.

His Seed the Earth possess.

And show his Covenant Grace.

My Feet from Snares he will free.

Have Mercy, Lord, on me.

From all my Soul retrieve.

And all my Sins forgive.

And cruelly me hate.

On Thee I hopeful wait.

I wait thy Grace to see.
Israel, mighty God,
From all his Troubles free.
PSALM XXVI.
JUdge me, O Lord; with upright Heart
I Have walked, and still abide:
My Trust I Have placed in the Lord,
And will not turn aside.

Try, and make through Proof.

And walked in thy Truth.

Nor with Dissemblers gone.

The Wicked's Presence shun.

And to thy Courts repair:

With thankful Voice declare.

Has been my great Delight;
That holy Tabernacle, where
Thy Glory shines so bright.

Nor with the bloody Tribes;

Their Right-Hand's full of Bribes.

In Mercy, me redeem.

Thy Praise shall be my Theme.
PSALM XXVII.
THe Lord's my Light, and saving Health;
Why should I be dismayed?
The Lord supports my Life; of whom
Then should I be afraid?

Came on with horrid Frown,
Voraciously to eat my Flesh,
They stumbled, and fell down.

Fearless I would abide;
Should raging War against me rise,
In this I would confide.

Is in God's House to dwell;
That there I may his Beauty see,
And know his holy Will.

In his Pavilion, hide;
I safe shall, in his secret Tent,
As on a Rock, abide.

My Head, in Triumph, raise:
And I Will, with Shouts, my Offerings bring,
I Will sing, and sound, his Praise.
Second PART.

My fervent Prayer receive;
Have Mercy also upon me,
And speedy Answer give.

"Seek ye my Face; my meek,
And grateful Heart, with Joy replies,
"Thy Face, Lord, I will seek.

Thy Servant, with thy Rod;
Thou have me helped, now leave me not,
O my Salvation's God.

The Lord will me protect.

For the envious me inspect.

Of Foes, deliver me;
False Witnesses have risen up,
They breathe out Cruelty.

Firmly believed, to see
Thy Goodness crown me, in the Land
Of them that living be.

Take Courage from his Word;
Thy Heart he will strengthen with his Grace;
Wait thou upon the Lord.
PSALM XXVIII.
TO Thee, O Lord, my Rock, I cry,
Oh! do not silent from me keep;
Lest by thy Silence, quickly I
Become like those in Graves that sleep.

When I my Griefs, with Weeping, tell;
When I lift up my Hands, in Prayer,
Toward thine holy Oracle.

With wicked Men, whose Works are vile;
While Mischief rages in their Heart,
They others, with fair Words, beguile.

Strictly their bad Intents survey;
The Work, which from their Hands proceeds,
Retort, and their Deserts repay.

And Wonders of his Hand disdain;
Them, with Destruction he will requite,
And never build them up again.

A gracious Answer, when I craved.

In him I trusted, and am saved:
Therefore my Heart with Joy abounds,
And Songs of Praise I Will to him sing.

With Safety, his anointed King.

Thine Heritage, with Favor, bless;
With Plenty feed them, grant them Peace,
Still may they triumph with Success.
Common Meetre.

Thine own Inheritance;
Them rule, and feed, and over their Foes*
Them evermore advance.
As 148th Meetre.

The People that are thine,
Thy Heritage let have
The Blessing that is divine:
And all their Store
In Season send, and them defend,
Till Time's no more.
PSALM XXIX.
O All ye Monarchs of the Earth,
Unto Jehovah give,
Glory, and Power, to God ascribe,
From whom ye yours receive.

Unto his glorious Name;
Within his sacred Courts bow down,
And celebrate his Fame.

And down the Waters shower;
The God of Glory thunders loud;
Great Waters own his Power.

With Majesty he speaks:
Iehovah's Voice the Cedars rends,
Proud Leb'non's Cedars breaks.

Them, like a Calf, to skip*
Like a young Unicorn, the Mounts,
Leb'non, and Syrion, leap.
Iehovah's Voice strikes Flames of Fire;
And Lightenings blaze around.

Even Kadesh, with the Sound.

He lays the Forest bare:
His Glory in his House they praise,
Which Storms themselves declare.

And reigns forever King.

Them blessed Peace will bring.
PSALM XXX.
I WILL Thee extol, O Lord, on high,
Who raised me, when distressed;
Who checked my Foes insulting Joy,
And all their Hopes suppressed.

And thou did heal, and save.

And kept me from the Grave.

Your grateful Thanks express;
While you, with me, commemorate
His rect'ral Holiness.

Life from his Favor springs;
If Night be sill'd with Grief, and Tears,
With Joy the Morning sings.

"I shall unmoved abide.

Thou hid'st, and Comforts died.

My earnest Suit I made.

"When in the Grave I Am laid?
"Shall there my Dust thy Praise proclaim?
"Or glorious Truths declare?

And for my Help appear.

My former Mourning turned;
With Gladness thou have girt me round,
Who late in Sackcloth mourned.

Incessantly thy Praise;
O Lord, my God, my Thanks to Thee,
I Will render all my Days.
PSALM XXX. 2 d Meetre.
O Lord, I Will Thee extol with Praise,
Who me above my Foes did raise;
And their insulting Joy restrain.

My Prayer to Thee I did address;
And thou have healed my Grief, and Pain.

And keep my fainting Soul alive;
Lest to the Pit I should go down.

With thankful Hearts; while ye record
The Truth, and Goodness, he has shown.

His Favour's Life; if Evening weeps,
The rising Sun returns with Joy.

My foolish Heart grew vain, and said,
"No Change shall ever my State annoy.

Thy Favor made my Mountain strong;
Thou hid'st thy Face, and Comforts died.

My Pride, and Folly, I confessed;
And thus with Supplication cried.

If to the Grave descend I should?
Can there my Mouth thy Praises Sing?
Or can my Dust thy Truth declare?

And timely Succors to me bring.

Thou turned, and off my Sackcloth cast;
And round with Gladness girded me:

And not be silent; all my Days,
My God, I will give Thanks to Thee.
PSALM XXXI.
IN Thee, O Lord, I place my Trust,
O put me not to Shame;
Deliver me from threatening Ills,
As righteous is thy Name.

Deliverance speedy gain;
Be my strong Rock, and sheltering Tower,
Where I may safe remain.

For thy Name's Sake me guide.

Thou do my Strength abide.

My Spirit I commit;
Lord God of Truth, who to redeem
Have never failed me yet.

I always have abhorred;
But ever, in my greatest Straights,
Have trusted in the Lord.

The Mercies thou have shown;
For thou have mine Affliction seen,
My Soul in Trouble known.

Of a false treacherous Race;
But set my Feet at Liberty
In an enlarged Place.
Second PART.

My Trouble on me preys*
Mine Eyes consume, my Spirits fail,
My Strength with Grief decays.

Consume in Sighs, and Groans;
My Sins have robbed me of my Strength,
And wasted all my Bones.

I in Reproach was had;
I was a Terror to my Friends,
When I drew near, they fled.

Whose Name, and Mem'ry's lost;
Like earthen Vessels that are broke,
Away, as useless, tossed.

Just Fears about me spread,
While they took Counsel, and devised,
My guiltless Blood to shed.

"I in Thee, Lord repose;

"Me from pursuing Foes.

On me, thy Servant, make;
And thy Salvation to me grant,
For thy free Mercy's Sake.

Whose Pity still I crave;
But let the Wicked be ashamed,
and silent in the Grave.

Which grievous Slanders vent;
In Arrogance, and high Contempt,
Against the Innocent.
Third PART.

Reserved for the Just;
Which thou have wrought, before the World,
For all in Thee, who trust.

From all the Sons of Pride;
And covered from the Strife of Tongues,
In thy Pavilion hide.

For wondrous Kindness shown;
When threatening Dangers me enclosed,
Within a fenced Town.

"I Am banished from thine Eyes;
Yet thou have heard my groaning Voice,
And answered all my Cries.

Who does the Faithful guard;
But on proud Doers justly heaps
A plentiful Reward.

In his never failing Word;
Confirm your Hearts, all ye whose Hope
Is fixed on the Lord.
PSALM XXXII.
THrice blessed the Man, whom God forgives;
Whose Sin is covered with a Smile:

Whose Heart is truly purged from Guile.

Through Anguish of my troubled Breast,
My Bones grew dry, and waxed old;
I roared all Day, and found no Rest.

And Day and Night it is Strokes repeat;
My vital Moisture dried up,
As Ground is parched with Summer's Heat.

But own, my Sin, before the Lord;
Whose pard'ning Mercy soon stepped in,
And Comfort to my Soul restored.

In Times wherein thou may be found;
In mighty Waters raging Floods,
His steadfast Hopes shall never be drowned.

Where I from Trouble, safe abide;
With Songs of thy Deliverance, thou
Shall compass me on every Side.
Second PART.

And teach thee how thou may be wise,
A right to order all thy Walk,
I Will guide thee with my watchful Eyes.

Which Passion^, and not Reason, sway;
Whose Mouth, with Bit, and Reins, compelled,
Our Wills are forced to obey.

Their Sorrows greatly shall abound;
But him that on the Lord relies.
Unnumber'd Mercies shall surround.

Who, in his Laws, their Life employ;
Let all, who are upright in Heart,
With sacred Triumph shout for Joy.
PSALM XXXII. 2 d Meetre.
O Blessed Man, whom God forgives,
And covers all his Sin;

Who Is free from Guile within.

The Horror in my Breast,
Dried up my Bones; I roared all Day,
And found no quiet Rest.

Heavy upon me beat;
My Moisture dried, as Ground that is parched,
With Summer's scorching Heat.

My Sin, but freely own
My Fault to God; and thou forgav'st
The Guilt of what I Would done.

To Thee pour out his Soul;
Then though great Water-Floods should rage,
None over him shall roll.

From Harm, shall sheltered be;
With Songs of thy Deliverance, thou
Shall round encompass me.
Second PART.

How thou may wisely live:
And safe Direction, in thy Walk,
My watchful Eye shall give.

Submit to Reason's sway;
Whose Mouths with Bitt, and Reins, we rule,
And force them to obey.

Their Sorrows multiply;
But Mercy shall encompass them,
Who on the Lord rely.

And in the Lord rejoice;
Let all, that are upright in Heart,
Triumph with joyful Voice.
PSALM XXXIII.
REjoice ye righteous, in the Lord,
It Is yours his Fame to raise.

And join in Songs of Praise.

Loud let the Music sound.

His Works with Truth abound.

Is with his Goodness filled,

Their Host his Spirit willed.

Into a solid Heap;
In Storehouses reserves the Depths;
Which stated Limits keep.

In Fear, before him, stand.

'Twas fixed at his Command.

He makes their Purpose vain.

Through every Age remain.
Second PART.

Whom he has chose his own.

From Heaven looks down.

From's dwelling Place surveys.

And all their Works he weighs.

By Strength the Strong's not freed.

The Horses Strength, or Speed.

Whose Hopes in's Grace survive*

In Famine keep alive.

He is our Help and Shield.

Our Hearts with Joy are filled*

On us abiding be;
As thou do know our steadfast Trust
Is placed alone in Thee.
PSALM XXXIV.
Through all my Days, I Will bless the Lord;
My Tongue shall dwell upon his (...)

The oppressed shall hear, and Comfort raise.

Come, let us jo^n* ^' exalt his Name.

From all my Fears to rescue came.

And Gladness shone in every Face.

"God heard, and saved him from Distress.

(...), as Guards, around them ly;
(...) Deliverance them afford,
(...) to his Arms for Shelter fly.
Jehovah in:
They Are blessed who in his Strength confide.

And all your Wants shall be supplied.

And hungry, roar for Lack of Food;
Yet none shall seek the Lord in vain,
Nor want supplies of real Good.
Second PART.

"I Will teach you how to fear the Lord.

"That all his Days may prosperous be!

"Preserve thy Lips from speaking Guile:

"Seek Peace, preserve a friendly Mind.

His Ears are open to their Cry.

To r^se his Name beneath the Sky.

From all their Troubles sets them free.

The contrite Spirit save will he.

But God delivers out of all.

Not one of them be broken shall.

Their Guilt consumes, who hate the Just.

And none shall fail who in him Trust.
PSALM XXXV.
WIth them that strive, and fight with me,
Fight Lord; my Cause defend.

Me, with thine Aid, befriend.

My Persecutor's Way;
In Mercy, to my trembling Soul,
I Am thy Salvation, say.

Who would my Soul surprise;
Turn back, and to Confusion bring,
All that my Hurt devise.

Let them thine Angel chase.

And with swift Vengeance trace.

Have dig'd, and spread their Net.

Into the Toyls he set.

Shall shout her Thankfulness*
In his Salvation I Will rejoice,
And my Deliv'rer bless.

Who may with Thee compare?
Who frees the helpless from the strong*
And Poor from Spoiler's Snare.
Second PART.

With Crimes I never knew.

My very Life pursue.

With Sackcloth did invest;
With Fasts I mourned, and my Prayer
Returned into my Breast.

So were my Actions turned;
I bowed down heavily, as one
That for his Mother mourned.

When they assembled were;
Abjects, unknown, together get,
My Fame incessant tear.

Admitted to their Feasts,
At me have snarl'd, and gnash'd their Teeth,
And flung their impious Jests.

Me rescue from their Power;
My Darling from the Lion keep,
That threatens to devour.

With Thanks I Will Thee confess;
And, in the Face of all the World,
To Thee my Praise address.
Third PART.

My treacherous Enemies;
Nor them that hate me, without Cause,
Deride, with winking Eyes.

But foul malicious Lies,
Against the quiet in the Land,
They craftily devise.

"Ha, ha, our Eye it saw.

Nor far from me withdraw.

My God, my Cause decree.

Lest they triumph over me.

Have Cause to boast, and say,
"Ah! ah! it is as our Heart could wish,
"He Is now become our Prey.

Who at my Hurt, are glad;
Let them, who magnify themselves,
Be with Dishonor clad.

Who my just Cause confess;
"And say, The Lord be magnified,
"Who loves his Servant's Peace.

The Justice of thy Ways;
I Will spend my Days in sacred Hymns,
To celebrate thy Praise.
PSALM XXXVI.
WHen Man, I see, grows bold in Sin,
My Heart may well advise,
That there is no true religious Fear
Of God, before his Eyes.

And thinks himself approved;
Until, at length, he is sadly forced
To hate the Crimes, he loved.

Which from his Mouth proceed;
Wisdom is banished from his Heart,
And Goodness from his Deed.

He wastes his waking Time;
Himself he hardens in his Sins,
Nor sticks at any Crime.

And spares the guilty Blood;
Thy Faithfulness above the Clouds,
And makes thy Promise good.

Stands firm, and never de^reast;
Thy Judgments are unfathomed Depths,
Thou, Lord sav'st Man, and Beast.
Second PART.

How unconfined it flows!
Therefore, in Shadow of thy Wings,
Men's Son's their Trust repose.

Shall fully be supplied;
And dri^^ immortal Joys, at Streams
Which from thy Favor glide.

All richly flow^ from Thee;
We in thy Face's gracious Light,
An heavenly Light shall see.

That know Thee, still impart;
And let thy Faithfulness extend,
To all, upright in Heart.

Against me fatal prove;
Nor all the Force of wicked Hands,
Me, from my Hopes, remove.

Are fallen before our Eyes;
Down are they thrust, deprived of Power,
For ever more, to ^ise.
PSALM XXXVI. 2 d Meetre.
MY Heart concludes, the bold in Sin,
No fear of God has lodged within.

Until his Crimes most hateful prove.

Wisdom, and Goodness, he forsaken.

His hardened Heart's on Mischief bent.

And spares the Sinner, in his Sin^:
Thy Faithfulness unto thy Word*
And Saints, above the Sky has (...).

Thy Judgment mighty Depths contains;
Lord, by thy providential Care,
Both Man, and Beast, preserved are.
Second PART.

O thou who dwell'st the Heavens above!
Therefore Men's Sons, when they are distressed,
Fly to thy sheltering Wings for Rest.

Their joyful Souls are satisfied;
From Thee immortal Pleasures rill,
Where thou shall make them drink their fill.

Light, in thy glorious Light, we see.

Thy Justice to the upright in Heart.

Nor wicked Hand my Hopes remove.

They are thrust down, no more to rise.
PSALM XXXVII.
FRet not thyself, though wicked Men
Grow opulent, and great;
Let not their prosperous Vices raise
Thine Envy, at their State.

They shall be soon cut down;
They wither, as the verdent Herb,
Before the scorching Sun.

And practice all that is good;
So in the (...) thou safe shall dwell,
And (...) shall be thy Food.

Will thy Desires fulfill.

And he will perform all well.

As from the Clouds the Sun;
He Will make thy Justice forth to shine,
Bright as the Day at Noon.

Let no Impatience rise,
At their Success; who bring to pass,
The Mischiefs they devise.

Wrath utterly forsake;
Lest, Thee, Partaker in their Crimes,
Ungoverned Passions, make.

By a most righteous Hand;
But those that wait upon the Lord,
Inherit shall the Land*

On strictest Search, be found;

With Peace, and Joy, are crowned.
Second PART.

They gnash, and rage, and foam.

Their Day is near to come.

To make the Poor their Prey;
To cast the Needy to the Ground,
The upright Man to slay.

Their Bow be broke in twain.

What many Wicked gain.

But God the Just sustains.

Their Portion safe remains.

They free from Shame abide;
Though Days of raging Famine come,
They shall be satisfied.

Who dare the Lord provoke;
Like Fat of Lambs, they melt away,
And vanish into Smoke.
Third PART.

And takes no Care to pay;
But righteous M^n will Mercy show,
And freely (...) away.

The promised Land enjoy;
While such as fall beneath his Curse,
He Will from the Earth destroy.

Who loves his just Command:

Supported by thine Hand.

But righteous Men were fed;
Nor have their Seed forsaken been,
When asking for their Bread.

And blessed is his Race.

And so prolong thy Days.

Preserves, and never forsakes;
But the vile Seed of wicked Men,
Destruction overtakes.

There dwell as settled Heirs.

Right Things his Tongue declares.

None of his Steps shall stray.

The righteous Man to slay.

His Saints, without Defense;
Nor their rash Judgment ever approves,
But clears their Innocence.
Fourth PART.

And thine shall be the Right
To heir the Land; when wicked Men
Shall perish in thy Sight.

As Trees in native Ground.

When sought, could not be found.

And carefully attend
The upright Liver; and you will find
A blessed Peace his End.

One common Ruin share:
Vengeance, at last, will cut them off,
Nor any Wicked spare.

Is wholly from the Lord;
Who, when the Times most dangerous prove,
Will Strength to them afford.

He Will free them from the Unjust;
Them from their Rage, and Power, he will save,
Because in him they trust.
PSALM XXXVIII.
O Lord, rebuke me not in Wrath;
Nor, in thy Rage, chastise.

Sore pressing on me lies.

And leaves no Soundness there:
My Bones are pained, and find no Rest,
While all my Sins appear.

They Are a vast Burden grown;
I cannot bear their Punishment,
Nor their least Guilt atone.

Stench, and Corruption, grow.

I all Day mourning go.

And spread through every Part.

Through Anguish of my Heart.

To Thee are fully known.

Mine Eye-Sight's from me gone,
Second PART.

To see my wretched Plight;
My Kinsmen stand far off, and gaze,
At such a dismal Sight.

Their Snares for me did lay;
And they, that sought my Hurt, spread Lies,
And framed Deceit all Day.

As dumb, my Tongue was tied:

I never once replied.

Will answer when I call.

And triumph when I fall.

Thus constant preys within.

With Sorrow for my Sin.

Increased in Strength and Pride;
They, that injuriously me hate,
Are greatly multiplied.

A base ungrateful Crew,
Are now my Adversaries turned;
Because I Good pursue.

My God, from me depart.

Lord, my Salvation art.
PSALM XXXIX.
I Thought to guard my Ways with Care,
And lest my Tongue grow vain,
To clap the Bridle to my Mouth;
While I Am with the Profane.

A while, I held my Peace,
From good Discourse; but this I found,
Did inward Pain increase*

While I was musing long;
The Fire within more fiercely burnt,
Then spoke I with my Tongue.

And Measure of my Days,
How short they are; Oh, may I know,
How swift my Time decays.

Mine Age is Naught with Thee;
At's best Estate, sure every Man
Is wholly Vanity:

His mighty Stir is vain;
He heaps up Wealth, but knows not who
Shall heir his mighty Gain.
Second PART.

My Hope is fixed in Thee.

The Scorn of Fools, should be.

Because it was thy Will.

Remove the Strokes I feel.

And Man, for Sin, chastise;
So vain is he, as eat by Moths,
His Beauty fades, and dies.

To my Request give Ear;
For here I sojourn, Stranger-like,
As all my Fathers were.

In Mercy, now, restore;
Ever at thy Summons, I go hence,
And shall be here no more.
PSALM XXXIX. 2 d Meetre.
I Did resolve to guard my Ways,
And lest my Tongue grow loose, and vain,
To put the Bridle to my Mouth;
When ever I mixed with the Profane.

I heard their Talk, and held my Peace*
Nor uttered my devouter Thoughts;
But this did inward Pain increase.

And, while I mused, the mighty Force
Of Zeal, which burned within my Breast*
Broke forth in this divine Discourse.

And what is the Measure of my Days,
How they will issue; may I see
How swift my fleeting Time decays.

My greatest Age is naught with Thee;
Sure every Man, at his best State,
Is altogether Vanity.

Lo! with what Noise, and Toil, and Cares,
He heaps up Wealth, but all in vain:
He knows not who shall be his Heirs.
Second PART.

From such a fading World as this?
My Hopes are placed on Thee alone,
The Source, and Center, of my Bliss.

In Mercy, Lord, my Soul redeem;
And make me not the Scorn of Fools,
Who me reproach, and Thee blaspheme.

I would be dumb, and not complain.

Thy heavy Strokes from me restrain.

When ever Man offends Thee;
His Beauty blasts, as eat by Moths,
Sure every Man is Vanity.

With Pity Lord my Tears behold;
I, as a Stranger sojourn here,
As all my Fathers did of old.

My wasted Strength to me restore;
Ever by thy final Summons called,
I hence shall go, and be no more.
PSALM XL.
WIth unmoved Patience, for the Lord,
I waited hopefully;
He bowed to me a gracious Ear,
And heard my humble Cry.

Where plunged in Mire, I lay;
He set my Feet upon a Rock,
And firm he made my Way.

Praise to our God most high;
Many shall see, and learn to fear,
And on the Lord rely.

With Confidence, relies;
Who disregards the Proud, and such
As turn aside to Lies.

Which thou have wrought of old;
And Thoughts of Kindness toward us,
Are more than can be told.

Thou did no more desire;
Nor burnt, nor Sin Offering, but stric^
Obedience did require.

"Thy sacred Rolls declare;

"Thy Laws in my Heart are.

"Have preached Righteousness;
"Lo, Lord, thou know, I Have not refrained
"From publishing thy Grace.

"Nor from the World concealed,
"Thy Faithfulness, and saving Health:
"But Grace, and Truth revealed.
Second PART.

With hold not, Lord, from me;
But let thy Kindness, and thy Truth,
My constant Keepers be.

My Sins have seized me fast;
They blind me, they exceed my Hairs,
Therefore my Heart's laid wast.

To come, and set me free;
O gracious God, make no Delays,
But have to succor me.

Who at my Ruin aim;
May they who wish, and seek, my Hurt,
Be driven back with Shame.

Who shamefully me treat;
That sport themselves, and Triumph make,
At mine afflicted State.

In Thee be satisfied;
Who thy Salvation love, still say,
"The Lord be magnified.

Yet thinks on me always:
For thou my Help, and Savior, art,
My God, make no Delay.
PSALM XLI.
THrice blessed the Man, whose thoughtful Mind
The Needy does regard;
With Safety in the evil Day,
The Lord will him reward.

On Earth he blessed shall be;
And none of all his spiteful Foes,
On him, their Will shall see.

The Lord will Strength supply;
In Sickness, kindly turn his Bed,
That he may easy ly.

(I thus myself expres^'d)
"And h^al my wounded Soul, for I
"Against Thee have transgressed*

With Slanders me defame;
In Wrath, they say, "When shall he die,
"And perish shall his Name?

His Speech is (...) wi^^ Fr^^d;
He gathers Evil to his Heart,
Then spreads it all ^^road.
Second PART.

And do my Hurt devise.

"He Is fallen, no more to rise.

I nothing could conceal;
Who ate my Bread, yet basely has
Against me lift his Heel.

To me, I humbly pray;
And raise me up, that I their Crimes,
With Justice, may repay.

By this I surely know;
Because to triumph over me,
Thou suffer'st not my Foe.

(...) in mine Innocence;
(...) me before thy Face,
(...) my Defense.
Isr'el's House,
Be blessed by Sons of Men,
From Age to Age, till Time's no more.
Amen! O Lord, Amen!
PSALM XLII. SECOND BOOK.
AS pants the chased, thirsty, Heart,
After the cooling Brook;
So pants my Soul for Thee, O God,
For Thee I longing look.

Thirsts, while I Am exiled here;
When shall I come, and in thy Courts,
Before my God appear?

Have been my constant Food;
Whil^^ with continual Insult, they
Have cried, "Where is thy God?

How to thy House I went,
With Multitudes; in Joy, and Praise,
Thy sacred Day we spent.

Why art thou restless grown?
Trust God; I yet shall sing his Praise,
For his Salvation shown.

Remember Thee I will,
From Iordan's Banks, and Hermon's Mount*
And Misar's lowly Hill.
Second PART.

And poured the Waters down;
So over me have, with Force, and (...)
Thy Waves and Billows gone.

Shall brighten up the Day*
Each Night I Will Anthems sing (...) to Thee,
God of my Life, I Will pray.

"Why do forget me so?
"Why go I mourning, for the great
"Oppression of the Fee?

To hear my Foes upbraid;
While daily they with impious Scoffs,
"Where is thy God? have said.

Trust God: Thou yet shall sing
Loud Songs to him, who is thy God,
And Health's unfailing Spring.
PSALM XLIII.
JUdge me, O Lord, who only can
My Cause from cruel Men, defend;
From the deceitful, unjust Man,
O do thou me Deliverance send.

Why do thou cast me far away?
Oppressed by cruel Enemies,
Why go I mourning, all the Day?

Conduct my Steps, and be my Guide,
Unto thy holy Hill, and where
Thou, in thy Glory, do reside.

(...) God, my most exceeding Joy;
(...) Thee, O God, my God, I Will there,
(...) Songs of Praise, my Harp employ.

So restless, in thy frail Abode?
Trust God, for praise him yet shall I,
Who Is my Deliv'rer, and my God.
PSALM XLIV.
O Lord, our Ears have often heard,
Our Fathers have us told
Thy mighty Works, wrought in their Days,
And in the Times of old.

With thine avenging Hand,
The heathen Nations; and did place
Thy People in their Land.

Gained not, by their own Sword,
Neither could their own Arm them save;
But thy Right Hand, O Lord,
Thine Arm, and Presence, with their Hosts,
And thy peculiar Grace.

Safety for Jacob's Race.

To push down all our Foes;
And, through thy Name, tread under Foot,
Such as shall us oppose.

The Victory to gain.

And made their Hopes in vain.

And glory all Day long;
Forever will we praise thy Name,
In our triumphant Song.
Second PART.

With Shame, have cast us down;
Our Armies thou no more do lead,
Nor us with Victory crown.

Which spoil us, we have fled.

And others captive led.

Nor art the richer found.

A Scorn to all around.

A taunting Proverb, made;
By foolish People we are contemned,
They at us shake the Head.

See nothing but Disgrace;
And, covered with confounding Shame,
I Am forced to hide my Face.

Of our insulting Foe;
Who us reproach, and Thee blaspheme,
And all their Malice show.
Third PART.

Nor false in Covenant proved.

From thy just Ways, removed.

Where cruel Dragons roar;
And with the ghastly Shades of Death,
Thy People covered over.

Or to strange Gods bowed down;

To Thee (...) Hearts are known.

For thy Sake, killed all Day.

And cast us not away.

Unmindful of our Thrall?

Our Bodies prostrate fall.

The heathen. Powers shake*
Redeem us from our Enemies Hand,
For thy great Mercy's Sake.
PSALM XLV.
SUblimer Thoughts inspire my Breast;
My Tongue, in softest Notes, to sing,
Runs like a ready Writer's Pen,
A Poem sacred to the King.

Can with thy matchless Form compare;
All Grace into thy Li^ is poured,
Thee ever blessed, does God declare.

Thy conquering Sword upon thy Thigh;
Appear, in all thy glorious State,
Adorned with royal Majesty.

The Truth, Meekness, and Righteousness,
Strongly assert; and thy Right Hand
Shall teach Thee Wonders to express.

And pierce the stubborn Hearts of those
That set themselves against the King;
They fall, subdued, who were thy Foes.

Forever unremov'd shall stand;
Thy righteous Laws, and righteous Works,
Confirm the Scepter in thy Hand.

God, therefore, thine own God, has shed,
Above what all thy Fellows claim,
The Oil of Gladness on thy Head.

Their Perfumes to thy Robes impart,
As thou from the Ivory Palace came;
Whose fragrant Smell rejoice thy Heart.
Ophir's Gold,
Fair Bride, is placed at thy Right Hand;
Kings Daughters, in her splendid Train,
As Maids of Honor, waiting stand.
Second PART.

And to my Words incline thine Ear;
Thy native Land, and Friends, forget,
Thy Father's House, and Kindred dear.

But have his Love enflamed the more;
For he is now thy Head, thy Lord,
Him therefore worship, and adore.
Tyrian Daughters shall approach,
And lay their Offerings at thy Feet;
The wealthy Nations, with their Gifts;
Thy Royal Favor shall entreat.

In all Accomplishments Divine;
Her Garments wrought with Phrygian Skill,
With purest Gold, illustrious shine.

By the artful Needle curious wrought,
With Fellow-Virgins foll'wing her,
She shall, in royal Pomp, be brought.

In State moves on the glittering Train,
Till the King's Palace them receive;
And naught but endless Joys remain.

Shall, in thy Fathers Stead, descend;
Whose Fame, as mighty Princes, shall
Through universal Earth extend.

Through every Age, O glorious King;
And Nations shall, while Time does last,
In Consort join, thy Paise to sing.
PSALM XLV. 2 d Meetre.
MY Breast is inspired
With Thoughts more sublime;
My Tongue, in soft Notes,
Is ready to sing;
No Pen of swift Writer
Can with it keep Time;
A Poem most sacred
To Israel's great King.

Of Men, there is none
That can with thy Form,
So matchless, compare;
All heavenly Grace, in
Thy Lips, is poured down;
Thy God Thee forever
Does blessed declare.

Gird, O mighty Prince;
With Glory adorned,
And Majesty crowned.

Ride on the Defense;
Thy Right Hand shall teach Thee
Thy Foes to confound.

Their Hearts, with great Pain,
Who'^e Foes to the King;
They fall at thy Feet.

Secure shall remain;
Thy Kingdom's just Laws are
Thy Scepter of State.

But Justice do love;
God, therefore, thy God,
Anointed has Thee,
With rich Oil of Gladness,
In Measure above
All Those that esteemed
Thy Fellows may be.

Their Fragrance out send,
From the Ivory Palace,
With which they are glad.

Kings Daughters attend
The Queen, at thy Right Hand,
In Ophir's Gold clad.
Second PART.

And hear thou my Word;
Thy Kindred, and Land,
Forget thou must quite,

Who now is thy Lord;
So the King in thy Beauty,
Shall greatly delight.
Tire,
Their Presents shall bring
The Rich, with their Gifts,
Thy Favor entreat.

Who sprang from a King;
Thy Garments embroidered
With Gold, are mo^^ neat.

In Needle Work Robes;
With Virgins, her Mates,
That on her attend.

That ring through the Globes;
And enter the Palace,
With Joys that never end.

From Thee, there shall spring
A Race, through the Earth,
Great Princes in Fame.

All Ages shall sing;
And Nations, forever,
Thy Praises proclaim.
PSALM XLVI.
GOD is our Refuge, where we are safe,
Our Strength by whom we stand;
He is a very present Help,
When Troubles are at Hand.

Though the Earth should be displaced;
Though Mountains, torn from their deep Roots,
Were in the Mid-Sea cast.

And make the Waters roar;
And the swol'n Billows Mountains shake,
With Dashings on the Shore.

The City of our God;
There the Most-High, his sacred Tent,
Has fixed, for his Abode.

She unremov'd is stayed;
From early Dawn of fittest Time,
God will afford her Aid.

In Tumults were envolv'd;
But God gave forth his powerful Word,
And all the Earth dissolved.

And will our Cause defend;
The mighty God of Jacob is
Our Refuge, and our Friend.

For us, has newly wrought!
What dreadful Desolations, he,
Upon the Earth, has brought!

No more, our Hurt conspire;
He breaks the Bow, and Spear, and burns
The Chariot in the Fire.

I will exalt my Name,
In heathen Lands, and through the Earth,
Extolled shall be my Fame.

He will our Cause defend;
The mighty God of Jacob is
Our Refuge, and our Friend.
PSALM XLVI. 2 d. Meetre.
OUR Refuge is in God,
In him our Strength is found;
He is a very present Help,
When Dangers us surround.

Though the Earth's convulsed, and torn;
Though Mountains, rent from their fixed Roots,
Were to the Mid-Sea torn.

And make the Waters roar;
Should swelling Billows Mountains shake,
That border on the Shore:

Are to God's City sent;
Which glads the Place, where the Most-High
Has fixed his sacred Tent.
Zion, dwells,
She shall unmoved abide;
In fittest Season, God, for her,
Will speedy Help provide.

Kingdoms, in Wrath, combine;
But God, in hot Resentments, spoke,
And melted their Design.
Jehovah, with his Hosts,
Engages on our Side;
Our Refuge is in Jacob's God,
In whom we safe abide.

Which God, for us has wrought!
What fearful Desolations, he,
Upon the Earth, has brought!

Wars into Peace he turns;
He breaks the Bow, and cuts the Spear,
In Fire the Chariot burns.

I will exalt my Name,
In heathen Lands, and through the Earth,
I Will be extolled in Fame.
Jehovah, with his Hosts,
^^gages on our Side;
And Jacob's God our Refuge is,
In whom we safe abide.
PSALM XLVII.
CLap Hands, all People, shout to God;
With Voice of Triumph to him sing.

Over all the Earth, he is a great King.

And Nations at our Feet couch down.

His loved Jacob's glorious Crown.

Jehovah with the Trumpet's Lays.

Sing Praises to our King, sing Praise.

Your deepest Skill in Praise be shown.

God sits upon his holy Throne.

To serve the God of Abraham;
For Shields of the Earth to God belong,
Exalted greatly is his Name.
PSALM. XLVIII.
GREAT is the Lord, immensely great;
Greatly let them his Praise confess,
In City of our God who dwell,
That Mountain of his Holiness.
Zion, Joy of all the Earth,
Most beautifully situate;
There the great King, on her North Side,
His City built in royal State.

To be a Refuge strong, and high.

They only passed together by.

With Terror filled, confusedly fled.

There were they seized with Pain and Dread.

The Mid-land Sea to Fury wrought;
And the proud Fleets, from Tarshish Coast,
Were into sudden Ruin brought.

We Have seen, what us our Fathers told;
God, his loved City, still preserves,
And will, through future Times uphold.
Second PART.

We, to thy Temple, will repair;
Think on thy wondrous Grace, O God,
And wait for our Deliverance there.

Extends, far as thy Name is known;
Thy Right-hand's full of Righteousness,
As thou have said, so thou have done.
Zion shout for Joy,
And Judah's Daughters loud repeat,
In cheerful Songs, thy Judgments, L^^d*
Which our Deliv'ranc^ did complete.
Zion walk, go round her Walls,
Her lofty Towers number well;

And to your Sons this Wonder tell.

Through every Age, will be our God;
He Will guide us through the Vale of Death,
To Realms where none but Saints have trod.
PSALM XLVIII. 2 d Meetre.
GReat is the Lord, supreamly great,
And greatly to be praised;
In Zion, in that holy Mount,
Let high his Fame be raised.
Zion, Joy of all the (...),
Seated in beauteou^ wise;
The imperial Seat of the great King,
On her North Quarter lies.

To be a Refuge high.

But hastily passed by.

And in Confusion fled.

There, were they seized with Dread.

When thou the Word do speak,
Rouse up the Mid-land Seas to Rage,
And Ships of Tarshish break.

We Have seen, what we had heard;
God, his loved City, still preserves,
And is her constant Guard.
Second PART.

Whenever we are afraid;
Think on thy former Acts of Grace,
And silent wait thine Aid.

Far as thy Name is known;
Thy Right-hand's full of Righteousness,
Thou faithfully have done.
Zion, and Judah's Towns, rejoice,
Because thy Works are true.
Zion walk, go round her Walls,
And all her Towers view;

Nor from your Sons it hide.

To Death will be our Guide.
PSALM XLIX.
HEar this, all People, and give Ear,
All ye that dwell on Earth;

Of base, or noble Birth.

Which Wisdom will impart;
Of sacred Understanding are
The Musings of my Heart.

I will incline mine Ear:
And with soft Touches of my Harp,
Mysterious Truths declare.

Be overwhelmed with Fears;
When the Transgressions of my Heels
Encompass me with Snares?

And in their Riches boast,

To God sufficient Cost;

No Sum can equal be;)

And no Corruption see.

Alike go to the Grave;
And all their Wealth, though never so loath,
To their Successors leave.
Second PART.

Forever fixed in Fame;
And therefore calls his dwelling Place,
And Lands, by his own Name.

And, like the Beasts, he dies.

Still think their Sayings wise.

Death's Prey; over them the Just
Reign in the Morn; their Strength's consumed,
Whose Dwelling's in the Dust.

Me from the Grave retrieve;
Redeem me from the Power of Death,
And to himself receive.

Their House in Glory rise.

Their Glory, with them, dies.

And Men his Skill shall praise.

And never see happy Days.

And is not truly wise:
As void of Understanding lives,
So like a Beast he dies.
PSALM L.
THE mighty God, Jehovah spoke,
To the whole Earth did call;
From early'st Rising of the Sun,
Unto it is latest Fall.
Zion, famous in Renown,
Whose Beauty is complete;
The mighty God has clearly shined,
In all his royal State.

Before him Flames devour;
And Troops of raging Tempests, round
About him, fiercely pour.

His Summons he shall send;
That all his People, every where,
Before their Judge attend.

"My Saints, ( Jehovah said,)
"Those that, with me, a Covenant firm,
"By Sacrifice, have made.

Shall clearly see, and own;
His spotless Justice shall appear;
For God is Judge alone.
Second PART.

"I Will swiftly testify
"Against Thee, O my Israel;
"God, even thy God, am I.

"Of legal Sacrifice;
"Or Burnt Offerings; the Smoke of these,
"Before me, daily rise.

"From Fold, will I accept.

"On Thousand Hills are kept.

"The wild Beasts of the Fields.

"Is mine, and all it yields.

"The Blood of Goats, will I?

"Your Vows to the Most-high.

"In Prayer, devoutly raise;
"Then I Will deliver from thy Fears,
"And thou my Name shall praise.
Third PART.

"How dare thou to proclaim
"My Statutes? or, with thy vile Mouth,
"My sacred Covenant name?

"And cast my Word behind.

"And with Adult'rers join.

"Thy Tongue does Falsehood frame.

"Thy Mother's Son defame.

"Thou did of me surmise,
"I Am like thyself; I Will thee reprove,
"And rank them in thine Eyes.

"Who God forgotten have;
"Lest I in Pieces should your tear,
"And there be none to save.

"Best glorifieth me;
"And him that ord'reth right his Ways,
"Shall God's Salvation see.
PSALM L. 2 d Meetre.
THE mighty God, Jehovah spoke,
Did through the Earth his Summons make,
From rising to the setting Sun.
Zion, his peculiar Seat,
Whose Beauty's perfect and complete,
God shines in glorious Renown.

Devouring Fire shall march before,
And raging Tempests round him fly.

Throughout all Heaven, and Earth, he will send
His awful Summons, from on high.

"That Covenant have confirmed with me,
"By Sacrifice; with Hopes to at^one.

His spotless Justice shall declare;
For God himself is Judge alone.
Second PART.
Israel hear;
"While I against thee Witness bear;
"I Am God, thy Covenant God am I.

"I Will no Complaint against thee bring;
"These daily smoke before mine Eye.

"No Bullock from thy Stall I Will take,
"Nor any He-Goat from thy Fold.

"And Herds on thousand Hills combined,
"They all belong to me of old.

"Wild Beasts that in the Desert prowl,
"All subject stand my Face before.

"I need not ask of thee my Food;
"The World is mine, with all it is Store.

Could eat? or Blood of Goats should drink?

Thy Vows unto the Highest pay.

I Will save; and thou my Name shall praise.
Third PART.

"What Right have thou my Laws to teach?
"Or in thy Mouth my Covenant take?

"Yet my Instruction thou do hate,
"And cast my Word behind thy Back.

"Was to agree, and with him share;
"And with Adulterers did join.

"Thy Tongue Deceit, and Lies, did broach;
"And Mischief was thy chief Design.

"Do thine own Mother's Son defame.

While silent, I was like to thee;
"Now thou my sharp Reproof shall see;
"I Will rank thy Sins before thine Eyes.

Of God; left I in Pieces tare,
And there to save shall none be found.

And he, who orders right his Ways,
With God's Salvation shall be crowned.
PSALM LI.
O God, to me let Mercy flow,
For thou delight'st in Acts of Grace;
Thy many tender Mercies show,
And all my Trespasses erase.

And from my Guilt me purify.

With piercing Grief, before mine Eye.

And done this Evil in thy Sight;
Thy Sentence, Lord, is just, I own,
Thy heavy'st Judgments would be right.

My Mother me conceived in Sin.

O make me Wisdom know within.

Then shall I pure, and spotless, grow;
O wash away my Stains, most foul,
I then shall whiter be than Snow.

So shall the Bones thou'st broken shout.

And all my many Crimes blot out.
Second PART.

My Spirit ^ight, within me, make.

Nor thy good Spirit from me take.

With thy free Spirit me sustain.

And they shall turn to God again.

O God, thou my Salvation's God;
My joyful Tongue shall then sing loud,
And spread thy gracious Acts abroad.

Then shall my Mouth thy Praises sing.

Could please; or else I would it bring.

Is the most pleasing Sacrifice;
An Heart that is broken, and contrite,
O God, thou never wilt despise.
Zion's Sons with Goodness filled,
In thy good Pleasure succor them;
Defend thy Church, and firmly build
The Walls of thy Jerusalem.

Be pleased, while Saints shall Thee invoke;
Then, from burnt Offerings, Steams shall rise,
And Bullocks on thine Altars smoke.
PSALM LII.
WHerefore, O mighty Man, do thou,
Thyself, in Mischief boast?
Uninterupted daily flows
God's Goodness, without Cost.

In Falsehoods, spreads around;
Like a keen Ra^or, gives a deep,
And unexpected, Wound.

Than right, more to speak wrong;

O thou deceitful Tongue.

And snatch thee from thy Place;
Over throw thy House, and from the Earth.
Root thee, and all thy Race.

And thus, thy Fall, deride:

"Nor on his Strength relied;
"But, in the Abundance of his Wealth
"Himself secure he thought,
"And strengthened by his wicked Arts;
"Lo! how he is brought to naught!

Fruitful as the Olive Tree;
For I have ever fixed my Trust,
In God's Benignity.

For what thou did effect;
And patient wait thy promised Grace,
Which all thy Saints expect.
PSALM LIII.
FOOLS, in their Heart, say there is no God;
They so corrupt, and base, are grown;
They scatter loathsome Sin abroad,
Among them, that does Good, there is none.

On Sons of Men, with strict Survey*
To see, if Reason they approve,
And seek the Lord, in his right Way.

They wholly filthy were, and base;
Not one the Paths of Virtue trod,
Of all that vile degenerate Race.

Do they so far from Reason stray?
That they my People eat as Bread,
And unto God no Homage pay?

That fearless Crew were then surprised
With horrid Fears; and shamed at length;
For God their boasted Force despised.
Israel Help, from Zion, send?
When God shall back his Captives bring,
Then Jacob's Voice, in Shouts, ascend,
Glad Israel, loud, thy Praise, shall Sing.
PSALM LIVE.
SAVE, me, O God, for thy Name's Sake;
Me by thy Power defend,

Unto my Words, attend.

They up against me rise;
Feirce Men thirst for my Life, who set
Not God before they Eyes.

Who for my Life have stood;

And all his Threats make good.

And to Thee sacrifice;
Thy Name I Will ever praise, O Lord;
It Is pleasing in thine Eyes.

Which very great have been;
Mine Eyes, with Pleasure, thy Rebukes,
On all my Foes have seen.
PSALM LV.
GIVE Ear, O God, unto my Prayer;
Nor hide from my Request.

I roar, I Am so distressed.

By a vile impious Crew;
Who load me with foul Crimes, in Wrath,
And Hatred, me pursue.

Death's Terrors seize me fast;

Horror is over me cast.

(I said, while thus distressed,)
"Then would I fly from hence away
"And seek a Place of Rest:

"In some Desert alone;

"And Tempests were over blown.
Second PART.

Their plotting Tongues divide;
For Violence, and raging Strife,
I Have in the City spied.

Compass the City round;
Mischief, and Sorrow, sprung from thence,
In Midst thereof abound.

An hearty Welcome meets;
There open Fraud, and practiced Guile,
Depart not from her Streets.

This I could bear with Ease*
Should open Haters me insult,
I might have shunned these.

My Guide, mine Intimate.

And in God's House we sat.
Third PART.

And sink them quick to Hell;
For Wickedness does in their Hearts,
And in their Houses, dwell.

Will for my Help appear.

And he my Voice will hear.

But he has set me free;
My Soul in Peace, and Safety, dwells,
For many joined with me.

And smite them with his Rod;
Because they have no Changes felt,
Therefore they fear not God.

His Hands he did extend,
In Wrath; and most profanely broke
His Covenant, with his Friend.

But War in's Heart was found;
His Words were softer than the Oil,
Yet, like drawn Swords, they wound.

Who will sustain his own*
He Will never suffer righteous Men*
Though shook, to be over thrown.

Men of Deceit, and Blood;
They scarce shall live out half (...);
But I will trust in God.
PSALM LVI.
HAVE Pity, upon me, O God,
For Men would me devou^;
He daily striving for my Hurt,
Oppresses me with Power.

To swallow me, devise
For they are many, O Most-high,
That up against me rise.


Nor fear what Flesh can do to me,
For I trust in the Lord.

A Sense I never me^nt;
And, my Destruction to contrive,
Their Thoughts are wholly bent.

And secretly debate;
They strictly all my Actions watch,
While for my Soul they wait.

Escap^ thy dreadful Frown;
O God, in thy just Anger, cast,
This wicked People down.

From Place, to Place, I Have took
Are not my Tears all safe preserved.
And entered in thy Book?

I know; for God's mine Aid.

On which my Hopes are stayed.

What Man can do to me.

I Will render Praise to Thee.

My Feet from Falls defend;
That I may live, and all my Days
In thy blessed Service spend.
PSALM LVII.
HAVE Mercy, Lord, Mercy I crave;
I cast my Soul on Thee;
Till these Calamity's are past,
To thy Wings Shade I flee.

I Will make my fervent Cry;
The God that well for me performs,
And will not me deny.

Shame who would on me prey;
God will his Mercy, and his Truth,
On my Behalf display.

My Soul does dwell among;
Whose Teeth are Spears, and Arrows keen,
And as sharp Swords their Tongue.

Above the Heavens, O God;
And let thy Glory be displayed
Through all the Earth abroad.

My Soul almost dispair'd;
But they are fallen into the Pit,
Which they for me prepared.

I Will sing; and give Thee Praise.

Myself I Will early raise.

Thy Praises sing will I.

Thy Truth, the starry Sky.

Exalted high, O God;
And let thy Glory be displayed
Through all the Earth abroad.
PSALM LVIII.
DO ye speak Righteousness, indeed,
While ye confederate sit?
Or is, ye Sons of earthly Men,
Your Judgment just, and fit?

Your wicked Heart intends;
Thus swayed, you openly weigh out
The Violence of your Hands.

Strangers to Virtue, rise;
As soon as born, they go astray,
And give themselves to Lies.

Deaf Asps, they stop their Ear;

They Will no Instruction hear.

Of their sharp Teeth disarm;
Break the young Lyon's Teeth, O Lord,
Nor leave them Power to harm.

Away whose Waters soak;
May all his Arrows, when he brings
Them to his Bow, be broke.

So may they waste each one;
Like an untimely Birth, that dies,
And never sees the Sun.

He Will seize on them alive;
In his hot Wrath away them chase,
And with a Whirlwind drive.

The Triumphs of the Good;
Who, Victors over such wicked Men,
Shall wash their Feet in Blood.

"There is a kind Reward;
"Sure, there is a God, who judges right,
"And does the Earth regard.
PSALM LIX.
SAVE me, my God, from all my Foes;
Thy high Defense I crave,

From bloody Men me save.

And mighty Men combine
Against my Life; not for my Fault,
Lord, nor Offense of mine.

And all their Force prepare;
See, Lord, my Danger, stir thyself,
And for mine Aid appear.
Isr'el's God,
None of the Heathen spare;
No longer let thy Patience, with
Such bold Transgressors, bear.

Their Rage admits no Change;
They bark, and snarle, and growl, like Dogs,
And round the City range.

Words bitter, hard to bear;
Between their Lips are pointed Swords;
"For who (say they,) does hear?

And all the Heathen scorn.

For God's my Safety's Horn.
Second PART.

To help me, interpose;
He shall, with Pleasure, let me see
His Justice on my Foes.

Them slay not with one Blow;
But, Lord, our Shield, by thy great Pow'^
Disperse, and bring them low.

With grievous Sin; surprise,
And take them in their Pride, who speak
Such hideous Oaths, and Lies.

And all their Power restrain;
That they may know, in Jacob, God,
And through the Earth does reign.

Return, and meet, and howl;
And, tired with Ramblings, may they still
Around the City growl.

To get their Wants supplied;
And spend whole Nights in fruitless Search,
And not be satisfied.

And loud thy Grace confess;
Thou have my Tower, and Refuge, been,
In Day of my Distress.

I Will never cease to sing;
For God is my Defense, the God
Whence all my Mercies spring.
PSALM LX.
THOU have cast off, and scattered us,
O God, thou wast displeased;
Oh, turn thyself to us again,
And show thyself appeased.

With sore Divisions rent;
Oh, heal the Breaches thou have made;
It shakes, to Ruin bent.

Thy People did assign;
And of Astonishment has made
Us drink the deadly Wine.

A Banner thou have reared;
And it in Triumph is displayed,
So has thy Truth appeared.

May still Deliverance have:
O hear the fervent Prayers we make,
And let thy Right Hand save.

My Joy it cannot fail;
I Will portion out fair Sichem's Soil,
And meet out Succoth's Vale.
Gilead, and Manasah, both,
Already own my Cause;
The gallant Ephr'im's Tribe's my Strength,
And Judah gives forth Laws.
Moab shall serve to wash my Feet,
Over Edom I will tread;
The proud Philistian Lords shall stoop,
And to my Triumphs add.

And bring to our Command?
Who shall to Victory lead our Arms,
Through Edom's rocky Land?

Refused our Arms to bless;
Will thou not, now, our Armies head,
And crown them with Success?

Man's Help is vain we own.

It Is he our Foes treads down.
PSALM LXI.
LORD, hearken to my Cry,
And to my Prayer attend.

My Cry shall still ascend;
When sadly overwhelmed,
My Heart does fainting lie:
Conduct me to the Rock of Strength,
That higher is than I.

From Foes my powerful Aid.

And trust in thy Wing's Shade.

My Vows before Thee came;
Thou have appointed me the Lot
Of those that fear thy Name.

Long Life, and happy Reign;
As many Generations still,
His future Years maintain.

O God, before thy Face,
Upon his Throne, secured by
United Truth, and Grace.

My endless Songs of Praise;
And cheerfully perform my Vows,
Through all my future Days.
PSALM LXII.
TRULY, my Soul does wait on God,
Salvation comes from him alone.

He is, I shall not be over thrown.

Plot Mischief? as a bowing Wall,
Or a loose Fence, you all shall be;
And into sudden Ruin fall.

My Dignity with lying Arts;
If ever their Mouth is forced to bless,
Yet Cursing rages in their Hearts.

From him my Hopes have steadfast proved.

My high Tower, I shall not be moved.

My future Glory and Renown;
The Rock in whom my Strength is sure,
My Refuge is in God alone.

At all Times your fixed Trust repose;
Pour out your Hearts before his Face:
God is our Refuge from our Foes.

And great Men are Deceit, and Lies;
If both you in the Balance throw,
Lighter than Vanity they rise.

Or Violence; be not so vain;
If by just Means your Wealth grows great,
Set not your Heart on such low Gain.

Twice have I heard this Word aloud;
That boundless Power by sov'rain Right,
Does appertain alone to God.

Also, O Lord, belongs to Thee;
Therefore, to all the human Race,
Thou render'st, as their Works shall be.
PSALM LXIII.
O God thou art my Gracious God,
I Will early seek thy Face;
My Soul does thirst, my Flesh does long,
For thy refreshing Grace;
As in a dry, and thirsty Land,
Where Waters rare have been;

As in thy Courts I Have seen.

My Lips shall speak thy Praise.

To Thee, adoring raise

As with rich (...)
My Mouth her joyful (...) employ,
Thy Praises wi^^ to spread.

I will remember Thee;
My Thoughts, in Watches of the Night,
On Thee shall musing be.

I Will to thy Courts resort.

Thy Power does me support.

That seek my Life to slay:

Shall be the Foxes Prey.

And all that by him swear,
Shall glory; but their Mouths be stopped.
That full of lying are.
PSALM LXIV.
MY Voice, O God, in my Prayer hear;
Preserve me from the Foes I fear.

And Safety from their Rage provide.

And cast their Darts, even bitter Words.

And, fearless, sudden Shafts let fly.

To act the false, malicious Part;
Their private Snares to lay agree,
And vainly cry, "Who shall us see.

To drive their wicked Plots an End;
Their inward Thoughts, which they pursue,
And Hearts, ly deeply hid from View.

And wound them unexpectedly.

And all that see them, flee away.

Shall this the Work of God declare;
For they shall wisely understand
The Operations of his Hand.

Rejoice; and firmly trust his Word;
And all, whose Hearts are right with God,
Shall gloriously triumph aloud.
PSALM LXV.
Though the Earth sit silent, yet thy Praise,
O God, in Sion's heard;
There they perform, with cheerful Lays,
The Vows they have preferred.

To our Request incline,
All Nations shall, to thee repair,
And in thy Praises join.

Might flowing Mercy stay;
But thou our Crimes, O gracious God,
Shall wholly purge away.

May in thy Courts reside;
With Goodness of thy Temple, we
Shall then be satisfied.

Answers in our Defense;
Of distant Lands, and farthest Isles,
Thou art the Confidence.

Fixed on their Basis stand.

When stilled by thy Command.
Second PART.

Revere thy Tokens Voice;
The opening Morn, at thy Command,
And closing Eve, rejoice.

From God's full Springs above,
Thou visitest; preparest Grain,
And make it fruitful prove.

And on the Furrows bring;
It Is softened with thy gentle Shower,
Thy Blessing makes it spring.

Thou do with Goodness crown;
Thy Paths, which in the Clouds appear,
Drop plenteous Fatness down.

And cloth them in their Pride;
The little Hills are girt around,
With Joy on every Side.

With lowing Herds they ring;
The Vales are covered over with Corn,
They shout for Joy, and sing.
PSALM LXVI.
LET all the Earth, in Shouts, to God,
Their cheerful Voices raise;

And glorious make his Praise.

"How terrible art thou?
"Thy Foes, by thine almighty Power,
"To thee, are forced to bow.

The Glories of thy Name.

Struck Terror where they came.

Our Fathers passed the Flood,
Secure on Foot; there we began
To triumph in our God.

His Eyes the Nations spy;
Then let not mortal Rebels dare,
Themselves to magnify.

And loudly shout his Praise.

And stablisheth our Ways.

As Fire the Ore refines.

Affliction on our Loins.

With Insult, and Disgrace:
Thou us, through Fire and Water, led'st
Safe to a wealthy Place.
Second PART.

And Thee my Vows will pay:

When Troubles on me lay.

The very best that are;
The Fat of Rams, the choicest Bulls,
And Goats, I will prepare.

To you I will make known,
The many wondrous Acts of Grace,
The Lord, for me has done.

Poured out it is fervent Cry;
He heard; and then my joyful Tongue
Extolled his Name on high.

I any Sin regard:

And all my Prayer has heard.

Who has not turned his Face
From my Request; nor yet withheld,
From me his wondrous Grace.
PSALM LXVII.
BLess, Lord, thine Heritage,
In thine abundant Grace;
Let, on thy Servants, ever shine,
The Brightness of thy Face.

May, through the Earth, be known;
And all the Nations of the World
May, thy Salvation, own.

Let thine own People join;
And may the Gentile World, in Songs
Of Praise, to Thee, combine.

Be glad, and cheerful sing;
For thou art, over all the Earth,
A just, and gracious King.

Let thine own People join;
And may the Gentile World, in Songs
Of Praise, to Thee, combine.

And God shall bless our Store.

Shall fear, and, him, adore.
PSALM LXVIII.
RISE, Lord, and let thine Enemies,
Abroad dispersed be;
Let them, that impiously Thee hate,
Before thy Presence flee.

So, Lord, the Wicked chase;
As Fire melts Wax, so let thy Foes
Dissolve, before thy Face.

Before the Lord rejoice;
With Gladness may their Hearts be filled,
With Shouts of Joy their Voice.

With Joy exalt his Name;
Who by the Name Jehovah rides
On Heavens extended Frame.

Is, as a Father, kind
To Orphans; and a righteous Judge,
In him, the Widows find.

He breaks the Captives Chain,
And sets them free; but Rebels, plagued,
In a dry Land remain.
Second PART.
Egypt went*
And did our Armies Head,
Their Marches, in the Wilderness,
Through all their Wand'rings lead;

And thus thy Presence own;
Sinai itself then shook, for God,
Even Isr'el's God, came down.

And send a plenteous Rain;
When tired with Drought, thou kindly did
Thine Heritage sustain.
Canaan to thy Flock,
And fixed their Dwelling there;
Thou Goodness, Lord, did for the Poor,
Abundantly prepare.

'Twas thou that gav'st the Word;
And Virgin-Troops, thus, loud proclaimed
The Wonders of the Lord:

"Struck with a Panick, fled;
"And she that stayed at Home, their Spoils
"Did part, and on them fed.
Egypt's fully'd Slaves,
Yourselves ye now behold,
Shine, as Dove's Wings, with Silver tipped,
And Plumes, with yellow Gold.

Ye shone as Salmon's Snow.
Bashan, far excells;
Which many Heads can show.

God has desired this Hill
For his Abode, inhabit here
Jehovah ever will.

Miriads of Angels are;
With them, as once on Sinai's Mount,
Our God is present there.
Third PART.

Thy Churches glorious Head;
Thou have, Captivity itself,
Captive, in Triumph, led:
Rich Gifts, for Men, thou have received,
Even Rebels have their Share;
That God, the Lord, might with them dwell,
And take them in his Care.

Who daily does us load
With his rich Bounties from above,
Who Is our Salvation's God.

Salvations at Command;
And all our near Escapes from Death,
Flow from Iehovah's Hand.

The Head of all his Foes;
Their Chief, who, in his Trespasses,
Still on presumptuous, goes.

"You gained over Bashan's King;
"You, safely, through the Depths of Seas,
"Whenever it is needful, bring.

With the high crimson Flood,
Poured from your slaughtered Enemies;
And Dogs may lick their Blood.
Fourth PART.

Did thy Procession grace;
The Progress of my God, and King,
Into his holy Place.

On Instruments who played;
With Damsels, who to Timbrels sung,
And pleasing Consort made.

"Bless ye our God, (they sung,)
"In your Assemblies praise the Lord,
"Ye who from Israel sprung.
Benjamin,
And Judah's Lords, combined
With Zebulun, and Napthali,
And the Procession joined.
Israel, Strength commands,
And thee to Union brought;
And now, O God, confirm the Work
Which thou, for us, have wrought.
Fifth PART.

In Salem's chosen Seat,
May thither Kings their Presents bring,
And worship at thy Feet.

Wild Herds of Rage, and Might;
'Till with rich Presents, they submit;
Crush those in War delight.
Egypt's, and Cushes Princes then
Shall God their Offerings bring.

To God your Praises sing.

In ancient Times that were;
Lo! thence he sends his awful Voice,
A mighty Voice we hear.

Whose glorious Dignity
Is over Israel; and his Strength
Shines in the cloudy Sky.

Out of thy holy Place!
God, Strength and Power, his Israel, gives;
To him be all the Praise.
PSALM LXIX.
SAve me, O God, for mighty Floods
Rush in unto my Soul.

Where Surges over me roll.

My Throat is parched with Heat;
Mine Eyes, with Expectation, fail,
While for my God I wait.

My causeless Haters are;
They Are mighty, who, most wrongfully,
To shed my Blood would dare:

For Peace gave up my Right.
O God, thou know my Foolishness,
My Sins are in thy Sight.

On Thee, be put to shame,
For my sake; nor, O Isr'el's God,
Despair, that seek thy Name.

My Face with Shame is spread.

Of me a Stranger made.
Second PART.

Has quite consumed me;
On me has fallen the Reproach,
Which they have aimed at Thee.

Before Thee wept, and mourned;
My many Tears, and Abstinence,
To my Reproach they turned.

I was their Proverb long.

Was made the Drunkard's Song.

To Thee, I made my Prayer;
O God, in thy Salvation's Truth,
And many Mercies hear.

Let it not prove my Grave;
From all my Haters rescue me,
And from deep Waters save.

To swallow me, permit;
Nor let the Mouth, upon me close,
Of the voracious Pit.

Hear then, O Lord, my Prayer;
O turn to me, as manifold
Thy tender Mercies are.

But speedily me hear.

Unto my Soul draw near.
Third PART.

My Shame, and my Disgrace;
My Adversaries, and their Plots,
Are all before thy Face.

And when I looked around,
For some to pity, there was none,
No Comforter I found.

And Gall, gave me, for Food.

Their Trap, what should be good.

Their Loins be made to shake.

Thy Wrath hold on them take.

That they may none receive.

With Words thy wounded grieve.

No Part in Mercy claim.

And from the Just, their Name.
Fourth PART.

Set me, O God, on high.

With Thanks, him magnify.

And better in his Eyes,
Than any Ox, or Bullock young,
That Is ripe for Sacrifice.

The Safety I obtain;
Your Heart, who truly seek the Lord,
Shall Life, and Comfort gain.

And set his Prisoners free:

To praise his Name agree.
Judah's Cities build,
And his loved Sion save;
His People there shall safely dwell,
And sure Possession have.

What falls to their Share;
And they that love his Name shall dwell,
In Peace, and Safety there.
PSALM LXX.
DEliver me, O God;
To help me, Lord, make have.

Who seek my Soul to waste.
Defeat, and put to Rout,
All that desire my Hurt.

Who make my Grief their Sport.

In Thee be satisfied;
Who thy Salvation love, still say,
"The Lord be magnified.

Make haste to me, I pray;
My Help, and my Deliv'rer, thou,
O Lord, make no Delay.
PSALM LXXI.
IN Thee, O Lord, I place my Trust;
Me never put to Shame.

For righteous is thy Name.

Where I may still resort;
Thy promised Safety, Lord, I plead,
Thou art my Rock, and Fort.

The cruel, and unjust.

And, from my Youth, my Trust.

From my most early Days;
Thou took'st me from my Mother's Womb;
I Will ever sing thy Praise.

But on thy Strength I stay.

And Honor all the Day.
Second PART.

Old Age does me assail;
O do not thou forsake me, Lord,
When Strength, and Vigor, fail.

Against me falsely speak;
And they, who for my Life lay wait,
Together Counsel take.

"Pursue, and on him seize;
"There Is none to save him from our Power,
"He Will fall our Prey with Ease.

From me, oppressed with Grief;
O thou, my God, with timely Speed,
Appear for my Relief.

Who, for my Life, combine;
Reproach, and Infamy, be heaped,
On those my Hurt design.

On Thee, fixed all my Days;
To spread thy Glory, more and more,
I Will add new Songs of Praise.

My Mouth shall daily show;
Whose growing Numbers far surmount
The utmost I can know.

I Will cheerfully go on;
Thy Righteousness I Will celebrate,
I Will mention thine alone.
Third PART.

Unto this Day, me taught;
And I have openly declared,
The Wonders thou have wrought.

When old, and gray, I Am grown;
Till this, and to the future Age,
Thy Strength, and Power, I Have shown.

All that we can declare,
Who mighty Works have done; O God,
Who may with Thee compare;

Me, by Experience, know;
Yet shall thou me revive, and bring
Up from the Depth of Woe.

And to me Comfort bring.
Jacob's God, on Harp,
And Psaltery, I Will sing.

While I chant forth thy Praise;
My grateful Soul, by Thee, redeemed,
Shall join thy Fame to raise.

Shall every Day proclaim;
For they are disgraced, that sought my Hurt,
And brought to endless Shame.
PSALM LXXII.
GIve, Lord, the King, thy clearest Light;
Thy Righteousness give to his Son,

And to the Poor, se^ Justice done.

Sweet Peace, and all thy People bless;
The little Hills shall like them grow,
In happy Fruits of Righteousness.

And save the Offspring of the Just;
But, the Oppressor's haughty Power,
Shall break, and crumble into Dust.

Perform their Course, through Ages all,

As wat'ring Showers on dry Land fall.

And Peace abound, 'till there is no Moon.

From River, to the setting Sun.

In Homage, bow before him must;
His Foes shall, couching at his Feet,
In low Prostrations, lick the Dust.
Tarshish, and the Isles,
Shall costly Presents to him bring;
Sheba's high Lords shall offer Spoils,
And rich Gifts Saba's wealthy King.

Shall fall, and Homage to him pay;
All Nations, from the South, to North,
As sovereign Lord, shall him obey.
Second PART.

He Will free; when they his Help implore.

And save the Souls shall of the Poor

Redeem their Soul, by his great Might;
Their Blood, unjustly sought to spill,
Shall very dear be in his Sight.
Sheba's Gold,
To Him as Tribute shall be paid;
Daily his Name shall be extolled,
While constant Prayers are for him made.

Like Lebanon, shall shake, and sound,
So full the Ears, so thick the Crop;
In Cities Men, like Grass, abound.

And be transmitted with the Sun;
All Nations Bliss, from him, procure,
And him proclaim the blessed One.
Jehovah, God most High,
The God of favorite Isr'el's Seed;
From him alone, in Earth, and Sky,
The Things that wondrous are proceed.

Forever; let the whole Earth then
Be filled with his glorious Fame.
To which we shout, Amen; Amen.
PSALM LXXIII. THIRD BOOK.
YET truly God to Isr'el's good,
To all the clean in Heart.

My Steps almost depart.

To see the Wicked's Peace.

In Death, does on them seize.

Nor plagued like other Men.

Hangs round them like a Chain.

Have more than Heart could seek.

And loftily they speak.

Their Tongue walks through the Earth.

In their full Cups, and Mirth.

"(They say,) is Knowledge found?

In Riches they abound.

And washed my Hands, in vain.

Each Morn renewed my Pain.

What thus I rashly say,
Lo; then the Experience of thy Saints,
Each Age, I should betray.
Second PART.

It was too deep for me:

Then I their End did see.

And down to Ruin cast.

With Terrors they are laid waste!

Away their Glory flies;
So, Lord, when thou do rise to judge,
Their Show thou will despise.

Pain in my Reins increased.

Before Thee, like a Beast.

By my Right Hand did give.

To Glory me receive.

Can I desire, but Thee?

My Strength, and Portion be.

Shall into Ruin fall;
Those who apostatise from Thee,
Thou will destroy them all.

Still, near to God, repair;
I in Jehovah trust, that I
May all thy Works declare.
PSALM LXXIV.
WHY have forever cast us off,
O God? against thy Flock,
In thy delightful Pastures fed,
Why does thine Anger smoke?

The Lot thou did possess,
And have redeemed; this Sion's Mount,
Thy famous dwelling Place.

The lasting Ruins wrought;
All that thy Foes, with impious Rage,
Have on thy Temple brought.

For sacred Worship met;
In Token of their Victory,
Their Banners high they have set.

Was had in great Renown.

To break it is carved Works down.

Into devouring Flame;
And, level with the Ground, defiled
The Dwelling of thy Name.

To root out, they presumed;
The Synagogues of God, with Fire,
All, through the Land, consumed.

No Prophet calms our Woes;
How long our ruined State shall last,
There Is none among us knows.
Second PART.

O mighty God, defame?
Forever shall the Enemy
Blaspheme thy holy Name?

Thy Bosom, thy Right Hand.

Salvation through the Land.

The raging Sea divide;
And crushed the furious Dragon's Head,
Beneath the refluent Tide.

Are broken, by thine Arm;
And to the People given for Meat,
That in the Deserts swarm.

Thou dry'st up Rivers Might.

Thou form'st the Sun, and Light.

Are fixed by thy strong Hand;
The Summer's Heat, and Winter's Cold,
Obey thy wise Command.
Third PART.
Jehovah, how the Foe
Has loaded us with Shame;
And how the foolish People have
Blasphemed thy sacred Name.

To Herds of Prey give not;
Nor let the Assembly of the Poor
Be evermore forgot.

For the dark Parts, we see,
Of the Earth, are filled with rueful Seats
Of monstrous Cruelty.

Unheard, and filled with Shame
But let the Poor, and Needy, still
Have Cause to praise thy Name.

And bear in Memory,
With what Contempt, the foolish Man,
Daily, reproacheth Thee.

Of thine insulting Foes;
Their Tumult constantly ascends,
And more blasphemous grows.
PSALM LXXV.
WE thank, and praise Thee, God;
For that thy Name is near,
Thy Power, and Grace, which succors us,
Thy wondrous Works declare.

Strict Justice I Will maintain.

It Is Pillars I sustain.

And wicked curb their Pride.

Lay your proud Talk aside.

Promotion never springs.

And down another flings.
Iehovah's Hand,
There is a dreadful Cup;
The Wine is red, with bitter Drugs
It Is fully mixed up:

To each as he does please;
But the Impious all shall wring the Dregs,
And drink the very Lees.

The God of Jacob's Praise.

The Just to Honor raise.
PSALM LXXVI.
IN Judah, God's most clearly known;
In Israel, great is his Renown.
Salem placed;
And Sion's with his Dwelling graced.

The Sword, and Battle in the Field.

Excelling far the Mounts of Prey.

Death, in their Sleep, has them beguiled;
And none of all their bravest Bands,
Could find the Vigor of their Hands.
Jacob's God, in Anger, frowned,
Chariot, and Horse, in Heap were drowned.

Who can thine angry Presence bear?

The Earth stood still, and greatly f^^r'd.

And scattered Judgments on his Foes.

The Residue thou shall restrain.

Let all fear (...), and Presents bring.

By an avenging Stroke of Death;
He, to the mighty Kings on Earth,
Dispenses Terrors, in his Wrath.
PSALM LXXVII.
WIth mournful Voice, and ardent Cries,
To God, I made my Prayer;
I often to God my Suit renewed,
And he to me gave Ear.

My Hands stretched forth by Night,
And ceased not; my burdened Soul
No Comfort could admit.

But yet I found no Rest;
I poured out my Complaint, and still
My Mind remained oppressed.

So great I cannot speak.

I then Relief did seek.

I commun'd with my Heart;
My Spirit searched the hidden Cause,
And End, with all her Art.

"Will he no more be kind?

"Forever out of Mind?

"Does Wrath his Love restrain?

"'It Is this that gives me Pain.
Iehovah's Works,
Thy Wonders wrought of old:

Thy Doings shall be told.
Second PART.

Great as our God, there is none.

Have to the People shown.

Thou have from Bondage freed;
The Offspring of thy Favorites,
Jacob's and Ioseph's Seed.

Thee did the Waters see;
They fled for Fear, the Depths retired,
Struck with the Awe of Thee.

The Sky sent forth a Sound;
Thy pointed Arrows armed with Wrath,
In Vengeance flew around.

In roaring Thunders, broke;
The lower World with Lightenings blazed,
The Earth was moved and shook.

(A wondrous Way we own!)
Thy Path through mighty Waters lies,
Thy Footsteps are unknown.

By Moses's skilful Hand,
And A'ron's, through the Wilderness,
Safe to the promised Land.
PSALM LXXVIII.
MY People close Attention give,
And my Instruction wisely hear;
To wholesome Words, which I shall speak,
(...) obedient, listening Ear.

And ancient Mysteries unfold;

And what our Fathers have us told.

But to the future Race make known,
Iehovah's Praise, his mighty Strength,
And wondrous Works which he has done.
Jacob, fixed,
In Israel his good Laws ordained;
And charged our Fathers, all their Seed,
In Knowledge of them, should be trained.

Piously taught, these Things might know;
Their Children, yet unborn, might rise,
And them to their Descendants show.

Through every Age, might firmly stay;
The Works of God might not forget,
But learn his Precepts to obey.

A stubborn, and rebellious, Race:
Whose Heart was not sincere with God,
Nor Spirit steadfast in his Grace.
Ephraim,
Trained to the Use of Dart, and Bow,
In Day of Battle turned their Backs,
And meanly fled before the Foe.

And did his sacred Laws despise:

Which he had wrought before their Eyes.
Second PART.

In Zoa^'s Field, in Egypt's Land.

And made, in Heaps, the Waters stand.

And Fire, by Night; their Way to keep.

And gave them Drink, as from the Deep.

They ran, like Rivers, by their Path.

And the Most-High provoked to Wrath.

By asking Meat, as Lust them led

"Can God, in Deserts, Tables spread?

"The Waters gushed, and Streams overflow;
"But can he give Supplys of Bread?
"Or Flesh, on all this Host, bestow?
Jehovah heard, was very wroth,
And flaming Fire on Jacob fell;
His burning Anger fiercely rose,
Against unthankful Israel.

Nor in his Care, and Help, confide.

And Doors of Heaven, had opened wide.
Manna, for their Bread;
And gave them Corn, from Heaven, to eat.

And to the Full he gave them Meat.

And raised the South, by his Command.

Winged Fowl, as Seas unnumber'd Sand.

And with it spread their Tents around.

For thus their own Desire he crowned.

But while the Meat was in their Throat,

Down Isr'el's chosen young Men smote.
Third PART.

His wondrous Works gained no Belief.

Their Years in terrifying Grief.

And turned to God, with early Cry.

And their Redeemer, God Most-High.

And with their Tongues they basely ly'd.

Nor in his Covenant did abide.

Nor brought them to Destruction quite:
Yea, often he turned his Anger by;
Nor once did all his Wrath excite.

Weak Flesh, whose greatest Strength is vain;
A Puff of Wind, which flies away,
And never more returns again.

In Deserts, where his Power was shown?

Did limit Isr'el's holy One.
Fourth PART.

Which from their Foes Deliverance brought.
Egypt's Land,
In Zoan's Field, his Wonders, wrought,

To Blood; they could not drink the Gore.

He sent to plague, and to devour.

And Labors to the Locust, doomed.

Their Sycomores with Frost consumed.

Their Flocks hot Thunderbolts devoured.

And Troops of evil Angels poured.

From Death; the Plague upon them came.
Egypt's Firstborn he smote, the chief,
And ^trength, of all the Land of Ham.

Through Deserts his own Fl^ck did guide.

Where, on their Foes, he rolled the Tide.

The Borders of his holy Land;
Till to this Mountain they arrived,
The Purchase of his own Right Hand.

Before their Face; to them divide
Their Lots by Line; and made the Tribes
Of Israel in their Tents reside.
Fifth PART.

Provoked; nor did his Laws obey.

Like a false Bow, they turned away.

Their Idols moved his Jealousy.

And loathed Israel vehemently.
Shiloh's Tent he quite forsook;
Where he was wont with Men to dwell:

In Hands of Foes his Glory fell.

Against his Heritage he slam'd.

The Nuptial Songs were rarely named.

Nor did their Widows scarce repine.
Jehovah roused, as one from Sleep;
As strong Men shout, enflamed with Wine.

And put to endless Shame, their Foes.
Ioseph's Tent refuse;
Nor more the Tribe of Ephraim chose.
Judah's Tribe;
The Mountain Sion, which he loved.

And fixed it, like the Earth, unmoved.
David, whom
He from the Sheepfold did advance;
Jacob to feed,
And Israel, his Inheritance.
Israel led,
With great Integrity of Heart;
And guided all their State Affairs,
With skillful Hands, and prudent Art.
PSALM LXXIX.
THE Heathen, Lord, thy Heritage,
Did furiously invade;
Defiled thy Temple, and in Heaps,
Jerusalem have laid.

For Meat to Fowls of Heaven;
And thy Saints Flesh, to savage Beasts,
They cruelly have given.
Jerusalem,
Their Blood, like Water, shed*
And none was found to pay the last
Kind Office to the Dead.

Our Fame they deeply wound;
We Are made the very Scorn, and Mock
Of all the Nations round.
Jehovah! Shall thy Wrath
Against us never expire?
Shall thy inflamed Jealousy,
Burn like devouring Fire?

Thy wrathful Vengeance pour;
On impious Kingdoms, which thy Name
Never reverence, and adore.

Thy Favorite Jacob's Race;
Their Rage has utterly laid waste
His ancient dwelling Place.
Second PART.

Let tender Mercy flow;
Our Ruin speedily prevent,
We Are brought exceeding low.

For the Honor of thy Name;
For thy Name's Sake, deliver us,
And purge our Souls from Blame.

Among the Nations spread
Thy Fame, in Vengeance, in our Sight,
For Blood of Saints they have shed.

The sighing Pris'ner's Cry;
By thy great Power, preserve the Sons
Of Death, condemned to die.

Our Neighbor's Spite reward,
And the Reproach, wherewith they have
Reproached Thee, O Lord.

Will give thee Thanks always;
From Age to Age, we will show forth
Our great Redeemer's Praise.
PSALM LXXX.
THOU, who led'st Joseph, like a Flock,
O Isr'el's Shepherd hear;
Who dwell'st between the Cherubims,
Shine forth in Glory there.
Manasseh, Benjamin,
With Ephraim, thy Rearward;
Stir up thy Strength, and speedy come,
Our Savior, and our Guard.

Thy Face, so used to save,
To shine forth upon us, then we
Deliverance shall have.
Jehovah, God of Hosts,
Will thou, in Anger, smoke
Against thy People's mournful Prayer,
And they in vain invoke.

For Meat, and Drink, impose.

A Laughter to our Foes.

Thy Face, so used to save,
To shine forth upon us, then we
Deliverance shall have.
Second PART.
Egypt, thou did bring a Vine,
Under Oppression bred;
The Heathen, noxious Weeds, cast out,
And plant it in their Stead.

Where it was meant to stand;
There thou did make it take deep Root,
It grew, and filled the Land.

And Boughs God's Cedars hide.

Her Branch Euphrates Side.

Her Hedge, and laid her bare?
That all the Passengers that Way,
Do her in Pieces tear.

And sadly lay it waste;
The wild Beasts of the Field do make
Her Clusters their Repast.
Third PART.

And let thine Heart incline,
To look from Heaven, and behold,
And visit soon this Vine.

Did plant, and guard so long;
The Branch, which for thy self alone,
Thou made so very strong.

It Is Branches are cut down*
They perish do at thy Rebuke,
Because thy Face does frown.

Let thy Hand be displayed;
Upon the Son of Man, whom thou
Strong, for thyself, have made.

Nor more incur thy Blame;
Oh, do thou us revive, and we
Will call upon thy Name.

Thy Face, so used to save,
To shine forth upon us, then we
Deliverance shall have.
PSALM LXXXI.
WIth raised Voice, to God, our Strength,
Aloud his Praises sing;
With Shouting, make a joyful Noise,
To Jacob's God, and King.

And with your Voices join;
The pleasant Harp, and Psaltery,
In Consort sweet combine.

When our Feast-Days arrive.
Israel, for a Statute Law,
This Jacob's God did give.
Joseph, set,
When thorough Egypt's Land
He went; where we a Language heard,
We could not understand.

The Burden on him lay;
His Hands then ceased from the Pots,
And working in the Clay.

And I thy Griefs removed;
In Thunders secret Place replied,
At Massah's Stream thee proved.
Second PART.

"O Israel hear my Word.

"No foreign Lord adored.
Jehovah, I thy God, thee brought
"From Egypt's miry Clays;
"Thy Mouth wide open, I Will it fill,
"With Plenty, and with Praise.
Israel would not hear my Voice;
"Nor me their Choice would make.

"Their own Advice to take.

And walked in my Command.

And on them turned my Hand.

A forced Submission gain;
But as for them, their happy Times
Forever should remain.

And finest of the Wheat;
Of Honey, from the Rock distilled,
They, to their Fill, should eat.
PSALM LXXXII.
GOD, in the Congregation, stands,
Among the Men of Might;
The earthly Gods he strict surveys,
Their Actions judges right.

"False Judgment to award;
"The Wicked's Person to accept,
"And partially regard?

"And right the Weak distressed.

"With Tyranny, oppressed.

But walk perversely blind;
The Earth's Foundations all are moved,
And greatly undermined.

"Of the Most-High did call.

"Like other Princes fall.

Restore lost Righteousness:
For thou, the Nations of the World,
As Sovereign shall possess.
PSALM LXXXII. 2 d Meetre.
AMidst the Assemblies of the Great,
The World's great Ruler takes his Seat,
And earthly Gods does judge; (and says)

"Accept the Person, plead the Cause,
"Of such as walk in wicked Ways.

"To such as are in deep Distress
"Impartial Justice let be done.

"And, from the Wicked's griping Hands,
"Deliver ye the needy one.

They walk in Darkness; through the Land,
The Earth's Supports are overthrown.

"And styled you Gods; ye all, in Fame,
"For Sons of the Most-High have shone.

"Like other Princes fall; and then
"Account to me, for all your Wrongs.

For every Nation from it is Birth,
To Thee, by sovereign Right belongs.
PSALM LXXXIII.
O GOD, to our repeated Cries,
No longer Silence keep;
Hold not thy Peace, as unconcerned,
Nor let thy Vengeance sleep.

Have a fierce Tumult made;
And those, that impiously Thee hate,
In Pride lift up the Head.

And all their Craft employ;
Their chief Design's thy hidden ones
Entirely to destroy.

"The Nation from the Ground;
"That Isr'el's hated Name, no more
"Be in Remembrance found.

In Counsel, have combined;
These differing Nations, close in League,
Against Thee, Lord, are joined.
Esau's Sons, who dwell in Tents,
Ishm'el's rejected Line,
Moab, of Incest eldest Brood,
With Hagar's Arabs join.
Gebal, Ammon, Moab's Kin,
With Amalek conspire;
The Lords of Palestine's Sea Coast,
And with them wealthy Tire.
Ashur's powerful Troops, the League,
And common Cause, espouse;
These prove the strongest Arm of Strength,
To Lot's apostate House.
Second PART.

As Midian overtook;
As Sisera, and Iabin, felt,
At Kishon's fatal Brook.

Were put to Rout, and slain;
Who left their Carcasses for Dung,
On Endor's fertile Plain.
Zeb, and Oreb, make their Chiefs,
Like Vengeance seize them all:
As Zeba, and Zalmunna, fell,
May all their Princes fall.

"Each House of God we find.

As Chaff before the Wind.

With Flames the Mountains blaze.

And with thy Storm amaze.

May seek Iehovah's Name.

Until they dye in Shame.

To whom alone pertains
The Name Jehovah, art Most-high,
Over Earth's extended Plains.
PSALM LXXXIV.
HOW amiable, Lord of Hosts,
How pleasant is the Place,
Where thou, (...) Earth, art wont to show
The Glories of thy Face?

Iehovah's chosen Seat;
My Heart, and Flesh, spring up for Joy,
The living God to meet.

Their Nests, for their Abode;
There hatch their Young; O Lord of Hosts,
My Sovereign, and my God.

Abide; still they will Thee praise:

To travel Sion's Ways.
Baca's thirsty Vale,
Provide themselves with Wells,
And Cisterns; which the Rain from Heaven,
For their Refreshment, fills.

In Sion's Mount appear.

O Jacob's God give Ear.
Second PART.

Look graciously on me;
And, with thy wonted Smiles, the Face
Of thine anointed see.

A Thousand does excel;
My God's House Doors I Would rather keep,
In wicked Tents, than dwell.
Jehovah is our Sun, and Shield,
Will Grace, and Glory, give;
And, no Good Thing, will he deny,
Those who uprightly live.

The Hosts in Heaven, Earth, Sea;
That Man is truly blessed, who puts
His Trust alone in Thee.
PSALM LXXXV.
THOU, Lord, thy Land have Favor shown;
And back thy captived Jacob led.

And all their Sin have covered.

Thy flaming Wrath thou do appease.

And let thine Anger wholly cease.

Through Ages shall thy Wrath remain?

That we may Joy in Thee regain?
Jehovah, graciously appear,
And tender Pity to us show;
All the Salvation which we need,
Upon us bounteously bestow.
Second PART.

For to his People he will speak Peace,
And to his Saints; but let not them
Return again to Foolishn^ss.

Sure, his Salvation's near at Hand;
That the ancient Glory may return,
And firmly settle in our Land.

Justice, and Peace, kindly embrace

From Heaven looks down with smiling Face.

Our Land it is yearly Fruits display.

And guide our Steps in his just Way.
PSALM LXXXVI.
BOW down, O Lord, thine Ear, hear me;
Oppressed, and Poor, am I.

On Thee, my God, rely.

Have Mercy, Lord, on me,

Who lifts his Heart to Thee.

Ready to pardon all;
Plenteous in Mercy unto them,
In Truth, that on Thee call.

of my Request attend.

A gracious Answer send.

Nor any Works like thine.

Shall in sweet Consort join;
Themselves shall bow before thy Face,
And glorify thy Name.

Thee, God alone, proclaim.
Second PART.

In Truth will persevere;
Unite, and fix, my wandering Heart,
Thy sacred Name to fear.

Thy Glories ever tell.

Freed from the lowest Hell.

And powerful Troops have sought
To take my Life; who never employ,
On Thee, one serious Thought.

And gracious God, art found:
Thine Anger is not soon provoked,
Thy Grace, and Truth, abound.

Let Pity now be shown;
Thy Strength, unto thy Servant, give,
And save thine Hand-Maid's Son.

As all my Foes may see,
Oppressed with Shame; because, Lord, thou
Do help, and comfort me.
PSALM LXXXVII.
JEhovah, in the holy Mounts,
Has his Foundation laid.
Sion's Gates, more than
All Jacob's Tents, displayed.

And spread thy Fame abroad,
O thou Jerusalem; which art
The City of our God.
Egypt, and Babylon, I Will name,
(They somewhat have me known,)
Philistia, Tire, and Cush; lo there
Sprang some of great Renown.
Sion shall be said,
There many such were born;
And the Most-High himself shall her
Establish, and adorn.

Shall note, There born was he.

My Springs are all in Thee.
PSALM LXXXVII. 2 d Meetre.
JEhovah his Foundations laid,
On the renowned sacred Hills;
Sion's Gates, his Love's displayed,
More than the Tents were Jacob dwells.

Of thee, O City of our God.
Rahab name, and Babylon,
(Which know me,) with Philistia,
And Tire, and Cush; perhaps there is one,
Sprang from them, famous in their Day.
Sion's famed for bringing forth
Many renowned Men of Worth:
The Highest shall establish her,
With future Worthies her adorn.

He Will note, There such an one was born.

And all my Springs in thee are found.
PSALM LXXXVIII.
LORD, God of my Salvation, I
To Thee, by Day, and Night, do cry.

And to my Cry incline thine Ear.

My Life draws nigh unto the Grave.

Whose Strength is lost, and Spirit gone.

Like slain Men, in their Graves that ly,
Whom thou in Mind no more do bear*
Who by thy Hand consumed are.

In Darkness in the Depth of Woe.

And all thy Waves increased my Pain.

From me thou have removed far;
A loathsome Spectacle I Am made;
Shut up, to walk abroad afraid.

And spends itself in flowing Tears;
To Thee Jehovah, I have prayed,
And daily stretched my Hands, for Aid.
Second PART.

Shall dead Men rise, thy Praise to spread?

Destruction speak thy Faithfulness?

Thy Justice in Oblivion's Land?

Before Thee; still I Will early pray.

Why hid'st thy gracious Face from me?

Thy Terrors me Amazement gave.

Thy Terrors held, and bound me fast.

They flow, and compass every Side.

Thou from my Sight have far removed;
And those that my Acquaintance were,
In Darkness hide themselves, for Fear.
PSALM LXXXIX.
THE Mercies of the Lord, I Will sing,
And never cease the Song;
From Age to Age, thy Faithfulness
I Will publish with my Tongue.

Forever built remain;
Thy Faithfulness, thou, in the Heavens,
And like them, wilt maintain.

"An Oath to David swore;

"Secure forevermore.

Shall with thy Praises ring;
While thine assembled Saints, on Earth,
Thy Faithfulness shall sing.

May with the Lord compare?
What Sons of all the earthly Gods,
Vie with Jehovah, dare?

With a religious Fear;
And awful Reverence guards the Minds,
That round his Throne appear.
Second PART.

Or girt with Truth, like Thee?

As thou do rule the Sea.
Egypt's Power, with deadly Wounds,
Have into Pieces broke;
Thine Arm of Strength dispersed thy Foes,
With an avenging Stroke.

Which thou alone have made;
As for the World, with all it is Stores,
God it is Foundation laid.

Thou, by thy Power, did frame;
Tabor, and Hermon, famous Mounts,
Rejoice shall in thy Name.

Thy Right-hand's famed in Deed.

While Grace and Truth, precede.

They in thy Favor walk.

Justice shall them exalt.

Our Horn, through Favor shown.
Iehovah's our Defense; our King
Is Isr'el's holy One.
Third PART.

"Thou said, I Will Help impose
"On one that is mig^ty; whom I Have raised,
"And from the People chose.
David; him
"With holy Oil anoint.

"Support whom I appoint.

"Nor wicked Men control.

"And plague the spiteful Soul.

"His Right, Euphrates Stream.

"Of Safety, he shall cry.

"My Covenant stands fast.

"As Days of Heaven, shall last.

"My Precepts disobey:

"With Stripes, as Crimes prevail.

"My Truth shall never fail.

"Nor, what I Have said, deny.

"I Will not to David lie.

"Shall, as the Sun, endure:

"Which, Witnesses, are sure.

And Anger, off have cast.

In Dust his Crown debased.

His Forts in Ruin laid.

His Neighbor's Scorn he is made.

Confirming their Right Hand.

In Day of Battle stand.

And have eclipsed his Fame.

And covered him with Shame.
Fifth PART.

And we thy Absence mourn?
Forever? Shall thy Wrath, like Fire,
Against thy People burn?

Thou do for Man ordain?
Wherefore have thou created all
The Sons of Men in vain.

What Skill, or Power, can save
His Soul from his strong griping Hands?
Or rescue from the Grave?

In Truth, to David, swear?

Thy Servants treated are:
I Have, in my Bosom, the Reproach
Of mighty People borne;

Have poured out their Scorn;
They thine Anointed's Steps traduced,
And thus reproached Thee.

Amen; Amen; say we.
PSALM XC. FOURTH BOOK.
Through all the changing Scenes, have past
Over thy chosen Race;
Thou, Lord, alone, from Age to Age,
Have been our dwelling Place.

Were formed by thy Nod;
Thou Lord, from everlasting art,
To everlasting, God.

Do turn weak mortal Man;
For thou have said, "Ye Adam's Sons,
"Return to Earth again.

It would be, in thy Sight,
But as a Day, that is past, and gone;
Or a short Watch by Night.

Thou do them sweep away;
Like Dreams they vanish; in the Morn,
As Grass, look fair, and gay:

It Is Morning Beauty flies;
When Evening comes, it is all cut down,
It withers up, and dies.

Thy Wrath does us afright.

All plain before thy Sight.

To speedy End are brought;
We spend our Years, as quick as Speech,
Swift as a Breath, or Thought.

If Strength to Fourscore stay,
It Is Grief, and Pain; we are soon cut off,
And hence we fly away.
Second PART.

Wrath, as thy Fear, is great!

That we may Wisdom get.
Jehovah, O return;
How long shall be the Space?
And let thy yearning Bowels move,
To show thy Servants Grace.

Our Souls, and Spirits raise;
That we may triumph, and rejoice,
Through all our future Days.

Abundant Comfort yield:
As all our former Ones have been,
With great Affliction filled.

Be to thy Servants shown;
The Glory of thy promised Grace,
To all their Offspring known.

Let on us ever shine;
Guide, and confirm, our handy Work,
And prosper our Design.
PSALM XCI.
HE that, the Highest's secret Place,
His sure Retreat, has made,
Secure shall rest, from threatening Ills,
Beneath the Almighty's Shade.
Jehovah, I will say,
"He is my Refuge high,
"My strong Munition, and my God;
"On him I will rely.

Out of the Fowler's Snare;
And save thee, when the noisome Plague
Infects the vital Air.

His Wings Protection yield;
His never-failing Truth shall be
Thy Buckler, and thy Shield.

Nor Shafts that fly by Day:

Nor Noon's malignant Ray.

Yet shall it not touch thee.

And Sinners Portion see.
Second PART.

Thy Dwelling thou have made;

Nor Plague thy House invade.

In all thy Ways, from Harms,

Shall bear thee in their Arms.

Fearless, when ever ye meet;
The Lion young, and Dragons fierce,
Shall trample under Feet.

"His Freedom I proclaim;
"I Will set him high, from Dangers safe,
"For he has known my Name.

"In Troubles I Will be nigh,
"To rescue him from every Ill;
"And raise his Honor high.

"I Will satisfy his Soul;
"Then my Salvation to him show,
"Where endless Pleasures roll.
PSALM XCII.
IT IS good, and sweet, to thank the Lord;
Praise to thy Name to sing, Most-high.

And every Night, thy Verity.

With Psaltery, in sweet Compound;
On sprightly Harp, in one Consent,
With sacred Songs, and solemn Sound.

O lord, have made my Heart rejoice;
The Works thine Hand has wro't, shall raise
My shout to Thee, with thankful Voice.

And how profoundly deep thy Thought!

Nor Fools perceive what thou have wrought.

And flourishing, look fresh, and fair;
It is, that thou may on them bring
An endless Ruin, and Despair.


And all that work Iniquity,
In Wrath, shall be dispersed away.

Fixed as the Unicorn's, secure;
Thy fresh anointing Oil conveys
New Joys to me, unmixed, and pure.

Mine Ears the dismal End shall hear,
That on my secret Foes shall come;
And those me open Malice bear.

Like Lebanon's tall Cedars grow.

And flourish, in his Courts below.

With Vigor filled, and Verdure crowned.

In him there is no Injustice found.
PSALM XCII. 2 d Meetre.
IT IS good to thank the Lord,
And sing thy Praise, Most-high:

Each Night, thy Verity.

With Psalt'ry's tuneful Wind;
On sprightly Harps, in one Consent,
With solemn Voices joined.

Lord, makes my Heart rejoice;
I, in thy handy-Works, will raise,
With Shouts of Praise, my Voice.

How very deep thy Thought!

Nor Fools what thou have wrought.

Like Grass, look fresh, and fair,
It Is that to Ruin thou may them bring,
And cover with Despair.


And they that work Iniquity,
Shall be dispersed all.

As Unicorn's, on high;
And with fresh Oil, through all my Days,
Anointed be shall I.

Mine Ear the End shall hear,
That on my Spies, and Foes, shall come;
And such as Malice bear.

Like Leb'non's Cedars grow:

In's Courts they glorious show.

With Strength, and Verdure, crowned.

In him no Falshood's found.
PSALM XCIII.
JEhovah reigns with Strength begirt,
And Majesty arrayed,
The World immovably he fixed,
On sure Foundations laid.

From all Eternity.

JEhovah ever reigns,
With Majesty arrayed;
And Strength begirts his Reins.

Of raging Waves excells.

Strict Holiness
Will ever grace
Thy House, O Lord.
PSALM XCIV.
JEhovah, God of Vengeance, shine
Forth, in thy Justice, bright,

Thy haughty Foes requite.

How long, triumph, shall they?

And glory in their Way?

Thy Heritage oppress;

And murder, Fatherless.

"Nor Jacob's God discern.

When will ye Wisdom learn.

Nor see, who formed Man's Eyes?

Fools shall not he chastise?
Shall not he know, who teaches Men
The Knowledge they attain?
Jehovah knows the Tho'ts of Man,
That they are very vain.
Second PART.

And in his Law has taught.

Are for the Wicked wrought.

Nor Heritage quite leave.

To it the Good shall cleave.

Who Will on my Side appear?

Had not the Lord, been near.

Thy Mercy held me right.

Thy Comforts me delight.

Which Mischief frame by Law?

Of righteous Men to draw.
Jehovah, still have been,
To me, a Refuge high;
My God, who art my only Rock,
Where I for Shelter fly.

Upon their Heads, repay;
The Lord, our God, in their own Guilt*
Them utterly shall slay.
PSALM XCV.
O Come, let us, in Consort, join
In Songs to great Iehovah's Name.
The Praise of our Salvation's Rock,
With joyful Hearts, aloud pro^laim.

And our loud Anthems to him sing.
Iehovah's a great God;
Above all Gods he is a great King.

Of lofty Hills, are in his Hand.

His Hands have formed the firmer Land.

Our Knees to our Creator bend.

His Pastures feed, and Hands defend.

Then harden not your Hearts; as they
In Time of Provocation, did,
On Meribah, and Massa's, Day.

While my great Works shone in their Face.

Though wearied, with that stubborn Race.

"My Ways they know not, though the best,
"Therefore I swear to them, in Wrath,
"They never should come into my Rest.
PSALM XCV. 2 d Meetre.
O Come, let us unite, and sing
Unto Iehovah's Name;
The Praise of our Salvation's Rock,
With Joy, aloud proclaim.

And joyful Hymns loud sing.

O'^r all Gods a great King.

Are in his sovereign Hand.

His Hands formed the dry Land.

Before our Maker kneel.

He does us feed, and heal.

O grow not hard, as they
In Desert did, on Meribah's,
And Massa's woeful Day.

My Works shone in their Face.

That stubborn, faithless Race.

My Ways they will not know;
To them I swear, in Wrath, if they
Into my Rest should go.
PSALM XCVI.
Sing to Jehovah a new Song;
In this agree let every Tongue.

Daily his saving Health proclaim.

Make all their Tribes his Wonders know.

Glory, and Power, to God ascribe.

With Offerings to his Courts come you.

Let all the Earth him reverence there.

Jehovah reigns through the Universe;
The World unmoved shall stablish'd be,
The People justly judge shall he.

Seas, and their Stores, with roaring Voice.

Their Joy, in cheerful Shouts declare;
Then all the Trees shall leap and sing,
And Joy, through all the Woods, shall ring.

The World, with Truth, and Righteousness;
With Truth, and Justice, he shall come,
To pass on all their final Doom.
PSALM XCVII.
JEhovah reigns, let all the Earth,
Triumphantly rejoice;
And let the Multitude of Isles
Unite their cheerful Voice.

His Counsels are unknown;
But Righteousness, and Judgment, are
The Basis of his Throne.

Sink in the burning Flood.

Earth saw, and trembling stood.

Before Iehovah's Face;
Before that Lord, whose sovereign Rule,
Over all the Earth, takes Place.

Have published all abroad;
And all the World have clearly seen,
The Glories of our God.

And boast in earthly Clods,
Of all their Folly be ashamed;
Him worship all ye Gods.
Sion, and Judah's Daughters, heard,
With Joy, thy Judgments, owned.

Above all Gods enthroned.

All Evil disesteem;
The holy Souls he will guard, and them
From wicked Hands redeem.

Immortal Light, and Bliss.

Record, his Holiness.

SIng, to Jehovah, a new Song,
For Wonders he has wrought;
His Right Hand, and his holy Arm,
The Victory have got.

Fully performed have been;
The utmost Bounds of all the Earth,
Have God's Salvation seen.

In Songs of Triumph, raise;
Make the Air ring, with their loud Shouts,
And jointly sing his Praise.

In Psalms, the Lord's Praise sing.

In joyful Consort join.

The World with Justice, and it is Tribes,
To judge, with Equity.
PSALM XCIX.

Let guilty Sinners quake;

What Is right; in Jacob, Justice he,
And Equity, maintains.
Jehovah, our great God, exalt,
And worshipping bow down;
Prostrate, before his Foot stool, fall,
For he is the holy One.
Moses, and A'ron, with his Priests,
Sam'el, with those addressed
His sacred Name, called on the Lord;
Who answered their Request.

Declared to them his Will;
Then they his Testimonies kept,
And Statutes did fulfill.

Thy People for their Sake,
Forgavest often, yet on their Works,
Did just Revenges take.

And in his Courts adore;
Because Jehovah, our great God
Is Holy evermore.
PSALM C.
SHout to Jehovah all the Earth;

Approach his House with sacred Mirth,
Before him triumph, and rejoice.
Iehovah's God alone,
Who us and all did Being give;
We are his People, not our own,
The Sheep that on his Pastures live.

And, in his Courts, his Praise proclaim;
Your grateful Songs, in Thanks employ,
And ever bless his holy Name.

His Mercy is forever sure;
His Truth, through Ages past, has stood,
And shall, through every Age, endure.
PSALM C. 2d Meetre. as the old 122.
TO God, let all the Earth
Agree, with sacred Mirth,
In Shouts, to raise their cheerful Voice.

And come, with one Accord,
Before his Presence, and rejoice.

He Life and Breath, to all did give;
His People us he chose,
The Flock his Folds enclose,
And we on his fat Pastures live.

In Thanks your Hearts employ,
And make his Courts resound his Fame;
Strike up a grateful Song,
From every Heart, and Tongue,
To bless his great, and holy Name.

His Mercy, you shall find,
Is everlastingly secure;
His Truth, through Ages past,
Has stood unshaken fast,
And shall, through every Age, endure.
PSALM CI.
MErcy, and Judgment, claim my Song,
From Thee alone they spring:
Therefore, O Lord, my thankful Heart
Thy Praise shall ever sing.

When I the Crown receive;
The Pattern of an honest Heart,
To all my Court, I Will give.

I hate their ill Design,
Who turn aside from sacred Laws*
Their Works shall not be mine.

Shall from my Presence go;
With bad Men I Will no Friendship make,
Nor Favor to them show.

Who seeks his Neighbor's Hurt;
The haughty Look, and proud in Heart,
I Will banish from my Court.

That they may dwell with me;
And he that walks in perfect Ways,
My Favorite shall be.

In my House shall not dwell;
Those that addict themselves to Lies,
I Will from my Sight repel.

The Wicked from the Land;
That from thy City, Lord, I may
Cut off that impious Band.
PSALM CII.
JEhovah to my Prayer attend;
Before Thee let my Cry ascend.

Daily oppressed, in Trouble ly:
Incline thine Ear to me, with Speed,
And Answer give, in Time of Need.

Like the burnt Hearth my Bones decay.

Withers; that I forget to eat.

I am reduced to Skin, and Bones.

That lonely, in the Deserts, strole.

On the House Top, I watch, and moan.

Against me madly they have sworn.

And mixed my Drink with Tears I shed,

In Wrath thou do upon me frown;
Thou first did lift me up on high,
Then down most low have made me ly.
Second PART.

Like withered Grass, my Strength's decayed.

Thy Memory through all Ages sure.
Sion's Help appear;
The appointed Time of Favour's near.

Her Dust is precious in their Sight.
Gentiles, Lord, thy Name shall fear;
Earth's Kings thy Glory shall revere.
Sion's State repair,
He Will shine most bright in Glory there.

And their Petition shall be heard.

That the unborn Race may praise the Lord.

The Lord from Heaven the Earth did spy;

Leave to the poor condemned to live:
Sion, to declare his Name,
His Praise through Salem to proclaim;
Israel there, with one Accord,
And Kingdoms meet, to serve the Lord.
Third PART.

And of my Life cut short the Day.

In Darkness, set, while yet it is Noon;
Thy Years, no run of Time can waste,
Which through all endless Ages last.

The Heavens are Works thine Hands have made.

They all, like Robes, decay, and waste;
Thou as a Vest shall change them all;
And, at thy Word, be changed they shall.

No Bounds thy endless Years restrain.

Their Seed, before Thee, fixed abide.
PSALM CIII.
JOin all thy Powers, O my Soul,
God's holy Name to bless.

None of his Acts of Grace.

And Sicknesses remove.

And crowns thee with his Love.

As the Eagle's, he renews.

The Lord himself pursues.
Moses, he made known;
His Acts to Isr'el's Race.

To Wrath, but full of Grace.

Forever, when we swerve.

For none as we deserve.

Above this earthly Frame,
Is far ^xceeded by his Grace,
To them that fear his Name.

So far, his pard'ning Love
Does, our Transgressions manifold,
Distant, from us, remove.
Second PART.

So does the Lord the Just.

Remembers we are Dust.

As a Field-Flow'r new blown.

It Is Place no more is known.

And ever will endure,
To them that fear Thee; and thy Truth
To Children's Children's sure:

And his Commands obey.

Over all extends his Sway.

Bless ye Jehovah still:
Who hear his Voice attentively,
And constant do his Will.

That do his Pleasure whole.

The Lord bless, O my Soul.
PSALM CIV.
MY Soul, Jehovah bless; my God,
Thy Greatness knows no Bounds;
Unrivaled Honors compass Thee,
Thee Majesty surrounds.

As with a splendid Robe;
The beauteous Heavens, thy royal Tent,
Have stretched beyond the Globes.

Who lays, and firmly binds;
The Clouds his Chariot formed; and walks
On Wings of rapid Winds.

His Ministers, he makes.

Which from it is Place never shakes.

Did spread the mighty Flood;
Above the Mountains loftiest Heads,
The rolling Waters stood.

They hasted, and they fled;

To their appointed Bed.

Confin'st the watery Main;
That it should never more return,
To cover Earth again.
Second PART.

Which from the Mountains burst.

Wild Asses quench their Thirst.

They tune their cheerful Voice.

Thy Fruits the Earth rejoice.

And Herbs for Humane Use;
That he, abundant Food for all,
May from the Earth produce.

The Heart of Man, that chears;
The Oil, which makes his Face to shine,
And Bread, which Strength repairs.

Thy Cedars, Leb'non, there:

The Stork makes in the Fir.

And these their Refuge make:
While Rabbets, with the feebler Kind,
The Rocks for Shelter take.
Third PART.

The Sun knows his fixed Rout.

Then Forest Beasts crawl out.

From God they seek their Meat.

And close in Dens retreat.

Till the Evening gives him Rest.

The Earth's with thy Riches blessed.

Numberless creeping Things;
With Animals, both small and great,
That swim by unknown Springs.

Through trackless Paths, their Way;
There huge Leviathan, thou made;
Diverts himself with Play.

Do give to each their Food:

And all are filled with Good.

In deep Distress they mourn;
Thou take away their Breath, they die,
And to their Earth return.

And a new Life takes Place;
The Earth renewed, with Vigor blooms,
And Beauty in her Face.
Fourth PART.
Iehovah's Glory shall endure,
Forevermore most bright.
When God reviews his various Works,
He Is pleased with the Sight.

But cast an angry Look,
It trembles; if he touch the Mounts,
They vanish into Smoke.
Jehovah I will sing,
As long as I shall live;
While I my Breath, and Being, have,
Praise to my God I Will give.

To hear my thankful Voice;
While in Jehovah, and his Works,
I greatly will rejoice.

And the Impious cease to be:
My Soul, bless thou the Lord, let all
To praise the Lord agree.
PSALM CV.
GIVE Thanks to God, call on his Name;
And make his Deeds to Nations known:

Let all his wondrous Works be shown.

Your Hearts rejoice, that seek the Lord.

Thus ever be the Lord adored.

What Judgments from his Mouth proceed;
Abr'am's Race,
And ye his chosen Jacob's Seed.

His Judgments through the Earth extend.

Nor shall a Thousand Ages End.
Abr'am made;
And with an Oath to Isaac swore:
Jacob fixed it for a Law,
And with his Heirs forevermore.
Canaan, said he, to thee I Will give,
"The Lot your Children shall command:

Yea* few, and Strangers in the Land.

And still from Realm to Realm removed;

Yea, Monarchs, for their Sakes, reproved.

Whom I Have anointed by mine Arm;
And, at your Peril, see that ye,
Not, in the least, my Prophets harm.
Second PART.

He sent; which brake the Staff of Bread.
Joseph, sent;
Who, sold a Slave, to Ham was led.

It pierced his Soul to wound his Name.

God's Word, which tried, and cleared his Fame.

To set him free from all his Bands.

And Ruler over all his Lands.

Wisely his Senators to guide.
Israel down to Egypt came;
Did there a Sojourner reside.

And blessed with numerous Families:
He made them soon in Strength exceed
Their proud oppressing Enemies:

His People, they in Love received;
They sought his Servants to destroy,
Them often by subtle Arts deceived.
Third PART.
Moses then he sent,
With chosen A'ron, in his Name;

And Wonders, in the Land of Ham.

Nature the sovereign Orders knew.

Which the amazed Fishes slew.

Which climbed the Chambers of their Kings.

Dust, through their Land, to Lice up springs.

And flaming Fire their Land annoyed.

And, through their Coasts, their Trees destroyed.

At his Command; their Swarms abound.

And naked left the fruitless Ground.

Which, through each Town, and Village, flew,
He all their Firstborn sudden smote;
The Flower of all their Strength he slew.
Fourth PART.

Them, forth from Egypt's hated Ground;
None feeble, in their numerous Tribes;
No, not so much as one was found.
Egypt rejoiced, when they withdrew;
For on them seized Isr'el's Dread.

And Fire, by Night, their Marches led.

With Bread from Heaven, were satisfied.

And Rivers in dry Land supplied.
Abraham,
Bound by his Holiness, he thought.

With Songs of Triumph, forth he brought*

Even promised Canaan's fertile Lands;
The People's Labors they enjoyed,
All built, and planted, to their Hands.

Might carefully observe always;
And never forget to keep his Laws:
Therefore let all Jehovah praise.
PSALM CVI.
PRaise ye the Lord, give Thanks to him
He Is good; his Mercy never decays.

Or who can show forth all his Praise?

And always do the Thing that is right.

As one in whom thou do delight.

To see thy Chosen's good Advance;
That I thy Nations Joy may share,
Glory with thine Inheritance.

And, like them, from thy Paths have gone;
Our Deeds have been perversely wrong,
Against thee impiously we have done.
Egypt saw,
Our Fathers did not understand;
Thy many Mercies they forgot,
Provoked Thee, at the Red Sea's strand.

The Fame of's mighty Power to spread.

And them, through Deeps, as Plains, he led.

Who close pursued, he them did save;
And from their Enemies 'vengeful Arm,
To them complete Redemption gave.

Not one of them escaped alive.

And Praise, in Songs, to him did give.
Second PART.

Nor would they for his Counsel wait.

And tempted God, by asking Meat.

But Leanness in their Soul was thrown.
Moses in the Camp,
And A'ron God's choice holy one.
Dathan devoured;
Closed on Abiram's factious Crew.

The Flame their bold Abettors slew.
Horeb made;
And did the Idol Homage pay:

Of a dull Ox, that eats Hay.

Who had, in Egypt great Things done:
Ham;
His Terrors, by the Red Sea, shown.

But Moses, then, before him stood,
And filled the Breach, to turn his Wrath;
Lest he his Threatening should make good.

And gave no Credit to his Word:

The Voice of their most gracious Lord.

But perish in the Desert Sands:

And scatter them in distant Lands.
Third PART.
Baal-Peor^ joined;
And eat the Offerings of the dead.

The dreadful Plague among them spread.
Phineas rose, and Judgment wro't;
The Plague was stayed, the guilty slain.

His Race the high Rewards did gain.
Meribah;
That Moses suffered for their Sake.

With unadvised ^ips he spoke.

As God had given them Command.

And learnt the Manners of their Land.

Which them, in woeful Mischief, snared.

Their Offspring, cruelly prepared.

Of their own Sons, and Daughters, slain
In Sacrifice to Canaan's Gods;
The Gore did the whole Land distain.

While they on their own Works were bent;
After their own Inventions, they,
With lustful Hearts, a whoring went.
Fourth PART.

The Indignation of the Lord;
That those who, his Inheritance,
Before had been, he now abhorred.

Their Haters ruled with Rods of Steel.

And made them subject to their Will.

Through their bad Counsels, did rebel,
And moved his Wrath; until, beneath
The Weight of their own Crimes, they fell.

His kind Regards to them were shown;
His Bowels with Compassion moved,
When ever he heard their piteous Moan.

In his great Goodness did relent.

Where they, as Captives had been sent.

And from among the Heathen bring;
That we may thank thine holy Name,
And Songs of Praises to Thee sing.
Jehovah, Isr'el's God,
Eternally; with one Accord,
Let all the People hearty join,
And say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CVII. FIFTH BOOK. To Travelers.
GIVE Thanks to God, for he is good
His Mercy ever flows.

Whom he releast from Foes;

From North, South, East, and West.

And found no Place of Rest.

Did grievously oppress.

Who freed them from Distress.

And was their faithful Guide;
Till they arrived at Cities, where
Their Wants were all supplied.
Jehovah praise,
And make his Goodness known;
For he among the Sons of Men,
Works wonderful has done.

He kindly satisfies;
With Fruits of his Benignity,
The hungry Soul supplies.
Second PART. To Prisoners.

With Grief, and Chains, bowed down:

Dispis'd, and would not own:

They fell, and none could save.

And he Deliverance gave.

To Light, by his kind Word;
He broke their gauling Bands in Twain,
And Liberty restored.
Jehovah praise
And make his Goodness known;
For he, among the Sons of Men,
Works wonderful has done.

Are into Pieces broke;
The massy Bars of Iron are cut,
Asunder by his Stroke.
Third PART. To the Sick.

To gratify their Sense;
Till with Diseases they are chastis'd,
To punish their Offense.

To every Kind of Meat;
And they, their near Approaches make
To Death's unfriendly Gate.

Who their Distress relieves.

And them from Death reprieves.
Jehovah praise,
And make his Goodness known;
For he among the Sons of Men,
Works wonderful has done.

With thankful Hearts, be brought;
Declare with Joy, to all the World,
What God, for them, has wrought.
Fourth PART. To Mariners.

And hope great Gain to reap:
Iehovah's Works;
His Wonders in the Deep.

Like Mounts, the Billows rear.

Their Soul dissolves with Fear.

Terrors their Minds oppress.

Who frees them from Distress.

And quells their rougher Sport.

To their desired Port.
Jehovah praise,
And make his Goodness known;
For he, among the Sons of Men,
Works wonderful has done.

His Honor highly raise;
And where the assembled Elders meet,
Unite to spread his Praise.
Fifth PART. To Planters.

And dries the Fountains Heads.

The fruitful Soil he spreads.

Dry Ground, a springing Well.

A City where they dwell.

Which bring increased Stocks.

Nor lessens he their Flocks.

And soon brought low again;
By foreign, and domestic Ills,
Oppressed, and filled with Pain.

He pours Contempt, and Scorn;
He makes them traverse trackless Wastes,
Unpitied, and forlorn.

And does from Trouble keep;
He makes his Families increase,
Like fruitful Flocks of Sheep.

But the Impious silent grow.

And God's great Goodness know.
PSALM CVIII.
O GOD, my Heart is fixed;
My Tongue shall sing thy Praise.

Myself I Will early raise.

I Will praise thy glorious Name;
And to the Nations round about,
I Will sing, and spread thy Fame.

Thy Truth, the Clouds, transcend.

And over the Earth, extend.

Deliverance may have;
O hear the fervent Prayers I make,
And let thy Right Hand save.

My Joy's it cannot fail;
Fair Shechem's Soil, I will divide,
And meet out Succoth's Vale.
Gilead is on my Side*
Manassah owns my Cause;
Ephr'im's large Tribe's my chiefest Strength,
And Judah gives forth Laws.
Moab shall wash my Feet,
Over Edom I will tread;
The proud Philistian Lords shall stoop,
And to my Triumphs add.

And Edom's Towers shall lead?

Our Armies now succeed?

Man's Help is vain we own.

It Is he, our Foes treads down.
PSALM CIX.
GOD of my Praise, hold not thy Peace.

Are wicked, and deceitful, Mouths;
Which speak with lying Tongue.

Causeless my Life ensnare.

But I resort to Prayer.

For all the Good I Have done;
And for my undisguised Love,
Have cruel Hatred shown.

And close at his Right Hand,
To ^^^^rmine his dangerous Plots,
(...) Adversary stand.

His very Prayer displease.

Shall then another seize.

A Widow shall be made.

And strole, and beg their Bread.
Second PART.

Strangers his Labors rend.

Nor to his Seed extend.

Their Names be quite forgot.

Nor out his Mother's blot.

Before Iehovah's Face;
'Till he, from off the burdened Earth,
Their Memory erace.

Compassion to impart;
The Poor, and Needy, he pursued,
To slay the broken Heart.

And fall on his own Head;
The Blessing, he despised, shall far
Away from him be fled.

It shall, like Water, flow
Through all his Bowels; and in his Bones,
Like piercing Oil, shall go.

As Girdles him control.

Who speak against my Soul.
Third PART.

For thy Name's Sake, with me;
Because thy Mercy's very great,
Appear, and set me free.

My Heart, with Grief, does swoon.

Like Locusts, up and down.

Fat from my Flesh is fled.

On me, they shake the Head.

And make thy Mercy known.

Thou, Lord, this Thing have done.

And when they raise their Voice
With Insult, let them be ashamed;
Thy Servant let rejoice.

To see their Measures broke;
And, in their own Confusion, wrapped
Around, as with a Cloak.

And with my Mouth aloud;
My grateful Thanks I Will to him sing,
Among the Multitude.

Will stand, to help the Poor;
To save him from the unrighteous Judge,
Who would his Soul devour.
PSALM CX.
JEhovah said unto my Lord,
"Sit thou enthroned at my Right Hand;
"Till I thy Foes thy Footstool make,
"And them subject to thy Command.
Sion's Seat,
The Scepter of thy Strength, shall send;
Thence, in the Midst of all thy Foes,
Thy conquering Power shall wide extend.

To glorious Liberty (...) led;
Adorned with Holiness thy Seed,
As Dew from Morning's Womb, shall spread.
Jehovah, by himself, has sworn,
An Oath which he will never break;
"Thou art an everlasting Priest,
"Of the Order of Melchisedeck.

Shall, in the Day of Vengeance smite,
The greatest Monarchs on the Earth,
Who dare his Government to slight.

And with dead Bodies fill their Plains;
He Will sorely wound the potent Head,
Who over many Nations reigns.

While he the glorious Way shall tread;
Then, as Reward of all his Pains,
To endless Glories raise his Head.
PSALM CXI.
PRaise ye the Lord, with my whole Heart,
I will Jehovah praise;
With private Friends, and the whole Choir,
Who tread his righteous Ways.

Who Pleasure in them taste.

Forever more shall last.

The Lord is Good, and kind.

His Covenant keeps in Mind.

The Power of his Right Hand;
To give them, for an Heritage,
The Heathen's promised Land.

All his Commands shall last.

And stand forever fast.

His Covenant with the same,
He fixed forever; reverend,
And holy is his Name.
Iehovah's Fear true Wisdom is;
They heavenly Skill procure,
Who his Commands observe; his Praise
Forever shall endure.
PSALM CXII. Hallelujah.
THAT Man is blessed, who fears the Lord,
And in his Law takes great delight.

Blessed shall the Race be of the Upright.

His Justice no Decays shall find.

He Is just, compassionate, and kind.

And his Affairs, with Prudence, guides.

Forever sweet his Name abides.

His Heart is fixed, on God relies.

Just Vengeance, on his Enemies.

And gave the Poor a meet Supply;
His Justice ever shall be praised,
His Horn, in Glory, raised on high.

Gnash with his Teeth, and melt away;
While their Unjust, and base Designs,
Blasted, shall utterly decay.
PSALM CXII. 2 d Meetre.
COme, let us praise the Lord:
He Is blessed the Lord that fears;
Whose Heart the greatest Love,
To his Commandments bears.

On Earth, shall be;
His Progeny
With Blessings crowned.

His Justice never fails.

When Darkness most prevails.
His gentle Mind
The Poor's Grief feels,
He justly deals
With all Mankind.

And lends, nor hopes for Gain;
His Business wisely guides;

The just Man's Name,
With Fragrance, shall,
Through Ages all,
Still live in Fame.

His Mind, with Fear, surprise,
His Heart is firmly fixed,
And on the Lord relies:

Fearless, to see
The high Decree,
Seize on his Foes.

And gave the Poor Supplies;
His Righteousness shall last,
His Horn, in Glory, rise.

Grieve, gnash, and pine,
But their Design
Shall blasted be.
PSALM CXIII.
YE Servants of the Almighty King,
Your joyful Hallelujah's sing,
With Praise his glorious Name confess.

Till Time itself shall be no more*
Iehovah's sacred Name to bless.

Unto it is latest going down,
Iehovah's Name is to be praised.

Above the Realms of endless Day,
Iehovah's Glory's highly raised.

He in the highest Heaven dwells:

The Heaven, and Earth, with all their Host;

From Dunghills does the Needy raise.

With his own People's Princes great.
To equal Dignity might bring.

A joyful Mother to become.
O therefore Hallelujah sing.
PSALM CXIII. 2 d Meetre.
PRaise ye the Lord; his Servants, praise,
His sacred Name adore.
Iehovah's Name,
Both now, and evermore.

The Lord's Name's to be praised.

The Heavens his Glory's raised.

Enthroned above the Sky?

And Earth, to cast his Eye.

From Dunghills Needy brings:

Seats them on Thrones of Kings.

Her Offspring to afford
A joyful Mother's tender Care.
Sing Praises to the Lord.
PSALM CXIV.
WHEN Israel was from Egypt freed,
And from strange Language Jacob's Seed;
Judah bore his sacred Name,
And King in Israel he became.

Jordan drove backward to it is Head.

The little Hills, like frighted Lambs.

That thou, in such a Fright, did flee?
Wherefore old Jordan, did thy Tide,
Roll back, and to it is Fountain glide?

That ye, like Rams, so skip't and shook?
Why leap't ye little Hills, like Lambs,
That fly for Shelter to their Dams?

Bow, and retire, before their God.
Tremble, O all the Earth, with Fear;
Jehovah, Jacob's God, is here.

And turn them to a wa^ry Lake;
From flinty dry Rocks, by a Word,
Fountains of Waters can afford.
PSALM CXV.
NOT unto us, Lord; not to us,
But Glory to thy Name
We render; for thy matchless Grace,
And Truth, this Homage claim.

"Where is their God now gone?

And what he pleased has done.

By humane Hands designed.

But speechless are, and blind.

Nor feel they with their Hands.

Nor Speech their Throat command^.

And trusting to them pray;
Like them are blind, and senseless grown.
And stupid too as they.
Second PART.
Israel, trust thou in the Lord;
He is their Help, and Shield.
A'ron's House, in God confide*
Who only Help can yield.
Jehovah fear,
Upon the Lord depend;
It Is he, that will your Keeper be,
And as a Shield defend.

And still will do no less;
He Isr'el's Tribes, and A'ron's House,
Assuredly will bless.

He Will manifest his Grace.

You, and your happy Race.

Who Heaven, and Earth, has made.

But the Earth to Men conveyed.

No Praise to God afford.

And ever. Praise the Lord.
PSALM CXVI.
I Love the Lord, who heard the Voice
Of my Requests for Grace.

I Will pray, through all my Days.

Encompassed me around;
The Grave's strong Terrors seized on me,
Distress, and Grief, I found.
Iehovah's Name I called,
In this most fervent Speech;
"Deliver thou my Soul, O Lord,
"I humbly Thee beseech.

Our God, all Mercies flow.

When I was very low.

The Lord dealt well with thee.

My trembling Soul set free;
My Feet from Falls, thou have preserved,
And wiped mine Eyes from Tears.
Iehovah's Face,
Through all my coming Years.

Though I was greatly grieved.

I am by all deceived.
Second PART.

Whence all my Mercies came?

Upon Iehovah's Name.

I Will pay with great Delight.

Is precious in his Sight.

Devoted to thy Use;
Thine humble Handmaids Son, my Bonds
Thou kindly did unloose.

And on the Lord's Name call.
Jehovah, now,
Before his People all.

Their grateful Voices raise;
In Midst of Thee, Jerusalem,
Let all Jehovah praise.
PSALM CXVII.
LET all the Nations, through the Earth,
To praise the Lord combine;

Therefore the Lord praise ye.
PSALM CXVII. 2 d Meetre.
YE Nations every where,
Of Jew, or Gentile, Line,
To praise Iehovah's Name,
With Hearts, and Voices join:
With sacred Mirth,
His Praise be sung,
By every Tongue,
Throughout the Earth.

In Pity to us, flows;
The inexhausted Store
No narrow Limits knows;
Iehovah's Word
Shall still endure
Forever sure.
Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXVIII.
GIVE Thanks to God, for he is good;
His Mercy's ever sure.
Israel's Tribes now say, his Grace
Forever shall endure.

Let A'ron's House now say.

His Mercy 'll ne'e^ decay.

Whose Answer (...).

What Man can do to me.

With those my Cause espouse;
And I shall see a just Reward
Overtake my envious Foes.
Second PART.

Than upon Man rely.

Than Princes, ever so high.


But in Iehovah's Name, and Help,
I smote them to the Ground.

And raged, like crackling Fire
Of Thorns; but aided by my God,
They Are quenched, and soon expire.

But God did Succor bring.

And I Will his Praises sing.

And safe in God's Right Hand.

And Victory does command.

God's Wonders, with my Breath.

But gave me not to Death.
Third PART.

And I will enter in;
That I may sing Iehovah's Praise,
Who has my Savior been.

Shall enter, on set Days.

I Will give to thee the Praise.

Chief Cornerstone now lies.

It Is wondrous in our Eyes.

We'll it with Joy attend.

Prosperity now send.

In great Iehovah's Name;
A Blessing, from God's holy House,
To you, we loud proclaim.
Jehovah; who to us,
Light graciously affords;
Bind to the sacred Altar's Horns,
The Sacrifice with Cords.

My God, I Will spread thy Fame.

His Mercy's still the same.
PSALM CXIX. ALEPH.
THrice blessed are the undefiled in Way;
Who walk as God's Commands require.

Who seek him with their whole Desire.

Saying, when will thou comfort me?

Yet do not I thy Laws forget.

Those that in Malice me beset.

Who with thy Law do not agree.

They rage unjustly, help thou me.

But thy Commands I never forsook.

May keep the Laws thy Mouth has spoke.
Twelfth PART. LAMED.

Unchanged forever to endure.

Thou found'st the Earth, and it stands sure.

For all thy ready Servants are.

I Would long since perished in Despair.

Thou me new Life, by them, have brought.

For I Have thy Precepts daily sought.

But I Will thy Testimonies mind.

Exceeding broad thy Law I find.
Thirteenth PART. MEM.

It daily my sweet Study grows.

Have made me wiser than my Foes.

For I thy Statutes closely weighed.

Because thy Precepts I obeyed.

My Feet; that I might keep thy Word.

Because it is thou have taught me Lord.

Than Honey sweeter to my Mouth!

And hate the Ways that swerve from Truth.
Fourteenth PART. NUN.

And shining Light unto my Way.

Thy righteous Judgments I Will obey.

Revive me, Lord, after thy Word.

Skill in thy Judgments me afford.

Yet I thy Law do not forget.

Though Snares, for me, the Wicked set.

I Have chose; for my Heart's Joy they are.

As long as thou my Life shall spare.
Fifteenth PART. SAMECH.

But fix my Love upon thy Law.

My Hopes, from thy pure Word, I draw.

To keep my God's Commands I aim.

Let not my Hope be turned to Shame.

I Will to thy Laws still turn mine Eyes.

For they deceived themselves with Lies.

To love thy Laws, I Am therefore led.

And I thy awful Judgments dread.
Sixteenth PART. AIN.

Let no Oppressors me distress.

Lest haughty Foes should me oppress.

To see thy Help, and promised Word.

Thy righteous Statutes teach me, Lord.

I shall thy Testimonies know.

For Men thy Law do over throw.

Than Gold; the finest, and the best.

As right; but all false Ways detest.
Seventeenth PART. PE.

Therefore my Soul does keep thy Ways.

And Wisdom to the weak conveys.

For after them my Heart's in Flame.

Art wont to them that love thy Name.

And let no Sin, in me, bear Sway.

So I thy Precepts will obey.

And me to know thy Statutes cause.

To see Men violate thy Laws.
Eighteenth PART. TSADDI.

Thy Judgments upright are we find.

And faithful which thou have enjoined.

Mine Enemies thy Law forget.

Therefore my Heart on it is set.

My Mind thy Precepts yet retains.

Thy Law eternal Truth remains.

Yet great Delight thy Precepts give.

Oh! teach me them, and I shall live.
Nineteenth PART. KOPH.

O Lord; thy Statutes I Will obey.

May keep thy Testimony's Way.

Thy Promise did me Hope afford.

May meditate upon thy Word.

Lord, in thy Word revive my Heart.

They from thy Laws far off depart.
Jehovah, thou art near;
All thy Commands, as Truth, endure.

Thou have it fixed forever sure.
Twentieth PART. RESCH.

For I thy Law still bear in Mind.

May I, thy Word, me quickening, find.

For they to keep thy Law never strive.

Oh! in thy Judgments me revive.

For they have not kept thy Word in Mind.

Lord, in thy Mercy quicken me.

And lasts 'till Time no more shall be.
Twenty-first PART. SCHIN.

My Heart, in Awe of thy Word, stands.

That mighty Spoils of War commands.

For all my Ways are in thy Sight.
Twenty-second PART. TAU.

As thou have spoke, me prudent make.

Deliver me, for thy Word's Sake.

When me, thy Statutes, thou shall teach.

Therefore my Tongue thy Word shall preach.

For I, thy Precepts, made my Choice.

And greatly in thy Law rejoice.

Let me thy promised Succor find.

For I thy Precepts bear in Mind.
PSALM CXX.
IN my Distress, to God, I cried,
And he redressed my Wrongs.

And from deceitful Tongues.

What Benefits confer?

And Coals of Juniper.

In Meshech's barren Plain;
And yet, among the lawless Tents
Of Kedar, I remain.

That Charms of Peace abhor.

They all declare for War.
PSALM CXXI.
IF to the Hills I lift mine Eyes,
From whence should come mine Aid?
Jehovah come;
Who Heaven, and Earth, has made.

Thy Guardian never sleeps.

Of him that Israel keeps.

Stands by thee on thy Right;

Or Moon's cold Damps by Night.

Preserve thy Soul from Ill.

Keeps now, and ever will.
PSALM CXXII.
WITH Joy, I heard the People say,
Let Us to the Lord's House go and pray.

Jerusalem, within thy Gate.
Ierusalem's a City fair,
Compact, with beauteous Order there.

The Tribes which to the Lord belong.
To Isr'el's Witness we repair,
To honor God, with Praise, and Prayer.

And Thrones of David's royal Race.
Salem's Peace may lasting be;
For they shall prosper that love thee.

Thy Palaces with Joy be crowned.

May happy Peace, within thee stay.
Iehovah's House is there,
Thy Good shall be my constant Care.
PSALM CXXII. 2 d Meetre.
MY Heart rejoiced to hear
The People this declare,
We'll to Iehovah's House ascend.

Within fair Salem's Gate,
And sacred Worship there attend.
Jerusalem is built
A City, richly gilt,
Compact, and great shall be in Fame.

Thither his Tribes repair,
To thank, and Praise, Iehovah's Name.

With Thrones of David's Race.
Salem's happy Peace;
They prosper that love thee.

Thy Palaces, with Joy increase.

Whose Good my own I make,
Thy Peace shall be my constant Prayer.

His House makes his Abode,
Thy Weal shall ever be my Care.
PSALM CXXIII.
TO Thee, for Succor, in Distress,
I lift my longing Eyes;
Oh! thou Omnipotent, Supreme!
Who dwell'st above the Skies.

Their Mistresses, the Maids;
So to the Lord, our God, we look,
For his reviving Aids.

Oh! Pity to us show;
For loaded with most base Contempt,
We feel the Depth of Woe.

Is greatly filled with Scorn;
And the vile Insult of the Proud,
We heavily have borne.
PSALM CXXIV.
HAD not the Lord, may Israel say,
Appeared on our Side;

Rose, like the swelling Tide:

So fierce their Wrath did roll;

The Stream gone over our Soul.

And swept us quite away.

To their sharp Teeth, a Prey.

As Birds, from Fowler's, fled.
Iehovah's Name;
Who Heaven, and Earth, has made.
PSALM CXXV.
THey, like to Sion's sacred Mount,
Who in the Lord confide,
Shall stand unmoved, in midst of Storms,
And ever safe abide.

Jerusalem, ascend;
The Lord, his People, so surrounds,
And ever will defend.

On just Men's Lot rem^^^;
Lest righteous Men put forth their Hands,
And them with Evil stain.

Thy Goodness, Lord, impart;
O may it freely flow to all
That are upright in Heart.

The Lord shall force them down,
Where wicked Men are doomed to go;
But Peace shall Israel crown.
PSALM CXXVI.
WHen Sion's Captives God returned,
Such an illustrious Theme,
Struck us with Wonder and Surprise;
We were like them that dream.

Our Tongue for Joy did shout;
The Heathen said, the Lord, for them,
Great Things has brought about.

Are wrought, Lord, by thy Hand.

Like Streams to South parched Land.


Bearing choice Seed, shall sure with Joy,
Laden with Sheaves, return.
PSALM CXXVII.
EXcept the Lord do build the House,
The Builders labor all in vain:
Unless the Lord the City keep,
In vain the Guards their Watch maintain.

And eat thy Br^^d with Grief oppressed,
Is vain; without such carking Cares,
The Lord gives his Beloved Rest.

The fruitful Womb is his Reward.

So Sons of Youth are Parents Guard.

With Shafts, that on him ready wait;
He shall not be ashamed to speak
With the Adversary in the Gate.
PSALM CXXVIII.
THrice blessed are all that fear the Lord;
And walk in his pure Ways.

And prosper all thy Days.

By thy House Sides, shall grow;
Thy Children, round thy Table set,
Like Olive Plants shall show.

That does Jehovah fear.
Sion Hill,
Shall bless thee every where;
Thou, all thy Days, with joy, shall see
Ierus^lem's happy State:

And Peace on Israel wait.
PSALM CXXIX.
FROM my Youth up, may Israel say,
They often have me assailed;

But have not quite prevailed.

And put my Back to Pain.

The Wicked's Cords in Twain.
Sion hate, with Shame,
And in Confusion, fly.

But just spring up and die.

Nor Arms that binds the Sheave,

We, you our Blessing, leave.
PSALM CXXX.
LORD from the Heart, and Depth of Woe*
My Cry, to Thee, I send.

O let thine Ear attend.

Who could the Trial bear?

That thou may be our Fear.
Jehovah wait;
And I hope in his Word.

As my Soul for the Lord.
Israel trust in God, the Source
Of all redeeming Grace;

And all their Sins efface.
PSALM CXXXI.
O Lord, my Heart's not haughty grown,
Nor lofty are my Eyes;
In Things too great, and high, for me,
Is not mine Exercise.

And carried it as mild,
As Children weaned from the Breast;
My Soul's a weaned Child.
Israel learn, in God alone,
The God whom they adore,
To place their steadfast Hope, and Trust,
Both now, and evermore.
PSALM CXXXII.
THY Promise, Lord, to David, mind,
And all the Chast'ning of thy Rod.
Jehovah he has sworn,
And vowed to Jacob's mighty God.

Not on my Bed my Limbs, repose;

Nor Slumber shall mine Eyelids close;

And for his Ark, a resting Place;
Which shall the future Dwelling be,
Of the great God of Jacob's Race.

At Ephrata; but now have found
The chosen Spot, for it is Abode,
Where Hills of mighty Woods surround.

Our Worship, at his Footstool, pay.

And with thine Ark of Strength there stay.

Let all thy Saints aloud rejoice.
David's Sake,
Despise not thine Anointed's Voice.
Second PART.
David, swear in Truth,
The Oath he never will disown;
"That, one, descended from thy Loins,
"Shall surely sit upon thy Throne.

"And to my sacred Laws submit;
"Their Children also, evermore,
"Upon thy royal Throne shall sit.
Sion chose;
And there desired to have his Seat.

I Will dwell; for I Have desired it.

And satisfy her Poor with Food.

Her Saints, with Joy, shall shout aloud.
David's Horn I Will make to bud;
There mine Anointed's Lamp ordain.

His Crown shall flourishing remain.
PSALM CXXXIII.
BEhold; how charming is the Sight!
How good too does it prove!
When Brethren in their Hearts unite,
And live in Peace, and Love.

On A'ron's sacred Head;
Which down his Locks the Perfume shower'd,
And over his Garments spread.
Hermon's, and Mount Sion's Dews
Descend, and bless the Plains;
For there the Lord his Blessing shows,
And endless Life ordains.
PSALM CXXXIII. 2 d Meetre.
BEhold! how good it proves!
How charming is the Sight!
When Brethren, dwell in Love
In firmest Bonds, unite;
When all agree
To act their Part,
As with one Heart,
In Charity.

That casts a fragrant Smell,
Which poured on A'ron's Head,
A down his Locks it fell;
From thence it shed
It Is trickling Globes,
On's priestly Robes,
And Odours spread.

From Hermon's Top, that flow,
Or roll down Sion's Mount,
Revive the Plains below:
Jehovah there
His Bliss ordains,
With Life that reigns
For ever fair.
PSALM CXXXIV.
LO; all ye Servants of the Lord,
Who nightly stand, and wait,
Attending in his sacred House,
Jehovah celebrate.

Within his holy Place;
The Lord, who Heaven, and Earth, has made,
Thee out of Sion bless.
PSALM CXXXV.
Let Us join, and Hallelujah sing;
Praise ye Iehovah's Name;
O all ye Servants of the Lord,
His glorious Praise proclaim.

Or in his Court Yards meet;

To praise his Name is sweet.
Jehovah Jacob chose,
His own by special Grace;
For his peculiar Treasure took,
Israel, and all his Race.

Above all Gods we own.

In Seas, and Depths, has done.

From Earth, in Clouds combined;
He brings Lightning, with the Rain,
From unknown Stores the (...).
Second PART.
Egypt's Firstborn, of Man, and Beast,
He smote, through all their Coast.

On Pharaoh, and his Host.

Did, by his Power, subdue.
Sihon, King of the Amorites,
And Og, of Bashan, slew:
He Canaan's numerous Kingdoms smote,
And freed from Tyrants Hands.
Isr'el's Tribes,
He gave their fertile Lands.

Shall be forever known;
And we'll transmit thy Name, and Praise,
To future Ages down.

Who now oppressed mourn;
Will, for his Servants Sake, repent,
And from his Anger turn.
Third PART.

By all the Heathen Bands,
Are Gold, and Silver, shining Dust;
The Labor of Men's Hands.

And sightless are their Eyes.

Their Mouth, or Breast, supplies.

And Homage to them pay;
Who put their Trust in them for Help,
As senseless are as they.
Israel, bless the Lord;
O A'ron's, praise his Name.
Levi, bless;
Ye Just, his Praise proclaim.
Jehovah blessed be,
From Sion, with Accord,
Who dwells in Jerusalem,
Sing Praises to the Lord.
PSALM CXXXVI.
YOUR Thanks, to God, most good repeat;
His Mercy still prevails.

His Mercy never fails.

His Mercy lasts always.

His Mercy never decays.

His Mercy shall endure.

His Mercy's ever sure.

His Mercy still prevails.

His Mercy never fails.

His Mercy lasts always.
Egypt, in their Firstborn, smite;
His Mercy never decays.
Israel led from slavish Land;
His Mercy shall endure.

His Mercy's ever sure.
Second PART.

His Mercy still prevails.
Israel Passage through it gave;
His Mercy never fails.
Pharaoh's Host, with Seas, over spread;
His Mercy lasts always.

His Mercy never decays.

His Mercy shall endure.

His Mercy's ever sure.
Sihon, who the Am'rites Scepter swayed;
His Mercy still prevails.
Og, whom Bashan's Towns obeyed;
His Mercy never fails.

His Mercy lasts always.
Isr'el's Hands;
His Mercy never decays.

His Mercy shall endure.

His Mercy's ever sure.

His Mercy still prevails.

His Mercy never fails.
PSALM CXXXVII.
THere we sat down, and wept, by Streams,
Which glide by Babel's Walls;
While Sion's melancholy Themes,
Our mournful Mind recalls.

When Sion's Songs we sung,
On Willow-Trees, that flourished there,
As useless now we hung.

Insulted thus our Wrongs;
"Come, take your Harps, and cheerful sing
"Us, one of Sion's Songs.

To Aliens, in strange Land?
Ierus'lem, I forget;
Her Skill may my Right Hand.

Of thee, forgetful prove;
Or ever entertain a Joy,
Jerusalem above.
Edom's Sons,
In Salem's woeful Day,
Cried, "Raze it, raze the lowest Stones,
"And with the Ground it lay.
Babylon!
Whom we are doomed to see;
Happy's the Man, the Wrongs thou'st done
To us, returns on thee.

Shall take thy little ones,
As thou did ours, in cruel Hands,
And dash against the Stones.
PSALM CXXXVIII.
WITH my whole Heart, my Sacrifice
Of Praise, to Thee, I Will bring;
And openly, before the Gods,
Thy Praise, my God, I Will sing.

Thy Grace, and Truth, proclaim;
For over all, thou by thy Word,
Have magnified thy Name.

A speedy Answer gave;
Did Strength increase through all my Soul,
And from my Tears me save.

When they shall hear thy Word.
Iehovah's Ways, shall sing;
For great's thy Glory, Lord.

The Humble he respects;
But he far off beholds the Proud,
And with Disdain rejects.

Thee quickening me I have;
Thou Wilt stretch thy Hand on my Foe's Wrath
Thy Right Hand will me save.

The Lord will perfect make;
Thy Mercy fails not, Lord; the Work
Of thy Hands never forsake.
PSALM CXXXIX.
O Lord, thou do me search, and know,
Whether I sit, or rise.

Thy piercing Sight descries.

And know all my Ways.

But, Lord, thine Eye surveys.

And on me laid thine Hand.

For me to understand.

Or from thy Presence fly?

If deep in Earth I ly.

To utmost Bounds of Seas:

There would thy Right Hand seize.

The Curtains of the Night;
Even Night itself would round me shine,
As Noon Days strongest Light.

Thus Day, and Night, agree;
The darkest Night, and brightest Day,
Are both alike to Thee.
Second PART.

Are still possessed by Thee;
Thou, in the Womb, with tender Care,
Did wrap, and cover me.

My Admiration raise;
My Soul, thy marv'lous Works, ^^ows well,
And gives to Thee the Praise.

Who me in Secret wrought;
And, in the Depth of Earth, the Parts
To closest Union brought.

The daily Growth it took;
And all my Members yet unshap'd,
Were entered in thy Book.

O God, how wondrous kind!
From first, to last, how great's their Sum!
No Power of mine can find.

They far surpass the Sand;
Whenever I wake, I Am still with Thee,
Supported by thine Hand.
Third PART.

Thou will destroy, O God;
Therefore, from my Society,
Depart, ye Men of Blood.

And impiously proclaim;
Thine Enemies, perfidious take
In vain thy sacred Name.

Most hateful in mine Eyes?
Is not mine Heart even broke to see,
Against Thee, how they rise?

And number with my Foes.

My secret Thoughts disclose.

That lurketh in my Breast;
And lead me, all my future Days,
The Way to endless Rest.
PSALM CXL.
LORD, save me from the evil Man,
And such as violent are.

And daily meet for War.

To hiss out Calumnies;
Concealed, beneath their guileful Lips,
The Adder's Poison lies.

From violent Men me free;
Who would precipitate my Steps,
And think to ruin me.

And secret spread their Net
Across my Path; and artfully
Around me Toils have set.

"Thou art my God alone;
"Lord, hear my Supplication's Voice,
"O hear my piteous Moan.

Thy Shield over me was spread,
When I in Battle was exposed,
And covered my Head.

Of those that wicked be;
Nor further thou their ill Designs;
Lest they triumph over me.

With Falsehood, and Deceit,
Shall all the Malice of their Lips,
Come down, with all it is Weight.

They shall be burnt with Fire;
In Pits, from whence they never shall rise,
Deep plunged shall they expire.

On Earth, a resting Place:
Evil shall hunt the injurious Man,
And him to Ruin chase.

And Poor, will Judgment give.

And in thy Presence live.
PSALM CXLI.
TO Thee, O Lord, I cry,
Make haste, for me appear;
And when I call on Thee for Aid,
My Voice, in Mercy, hear.

As Morning Incense, rise;
The lifting up my Hands accept,
As Evening Sacrifice.

Before my Mouth, attend;
And keep the Door of my vain Lips,
Lest rashly I offend.

Nor let me ever share,
With wicked Men, in their bad Deeds,
Nor on their Danties fare.

Smite me, it shall not break
My Head, but heal like Balm; my Prayer,
In their Distress, I Will make.

Their Chiefs lay at my Feet,
Within my Power; they heard my Words*
But, Oh, how soft! how sweet!

Ly scattered all around;
As when one ploweth up the Earth,
And teareth up the Ground.

Directed are mine Eyes;
Let not my Soul be naked left;
My Trust on Thee relies.

Which they have laid for me;
And from the Nets which they have spread,
Who work Iniquity.

Together, in their Net;
While I, over all, in Safety pass,
And out of Danger get.
PSALM CXLII.
I Cried aloud, unto the Lord,
And fervently I prayed.

My Griefs before him laid.

Then thou my Path did know:
They laid their private Snares for me,
Wherever I should go.

That not one Friend was there;
All Refuge failed, even Flight was fled,
None for my Soul did care.

"Thou art my Hope alone;
"My Portion, while on Earth I live,
"And when from hence I Am gone.

O hear my earnest Cry;
Me from my Persecutors save,
Who stronger are than I.

That I thy Name may praise;
The Just shall me surround, for thou
Shall me reward with Grace.
PSALM CXLIII.
HEAR, Lord, my Prayer, to my Request,
Let thy kind Ear attend;
And in thy Truth, and Righteousness,
A gracious Answer send.

Of Justice, Lord, be tried;
For in thy Sight, no Man alive,
Could so be justified.

Down to the Ground did tread,
In Darkness made to dwell, as those
That Ages have been dead.

My Heart is desolate.

Thy Works I meditate.

For Thee my Soul does pant,
As thirsty Lands, in Summer's Heat,
That cooling Showers want.
Second PART.

My sinking Spirit save;
Lest I should soon become like them,
That lie down in the Grave.

For I in Thee confide;
Show me the Way where I should go:
I look to Thee, my Guide.

O Lord deliver me;
For Shelter, from their Rage, I fly,
To hide myself with Thee.

Forever to obey;
Let thy good Spirit me conduct,
In thy most righteous Way.

That all thy Name may sing;
For the Honor of thy faithful Word,
My Soul from Trouble bring.

Thy gracious Aids afford,
Destroy all that afflict my Soul;
For I Am thy Ser^^nt Lord.
PSALM CXLIV.
FOrever blessed be the Lord,
My Rock; who does instruct me right*
To guide the War; and Strength affords
My Hands, when I engage in Fight.

My great Deliv'rer, and my Shield,
In whom I trust; who, to my Power,
Makes Tribes submit, and Nations yield.

That thy Concern thou him have made!

Fly swiftly, as a passing Shade.

But touch the Mountains, Smoke shall rise.

With pointed Arrows from the Skies.

Rescue, and save me, from the Power
Of Aliens; who like Waters stand,
Wide gaping, ready to devour.

And utter Speeches full of Lies;
Their Right-hand's plighted Faith is found,
But broken Leagues, and Perjuries.
Second PART.

My Voice, and Psaltery, agree,
The Ten string'd Instrument I Will bring,
And join in Hymns of Praise to Thee.

And Victory to their Arms affords;
His Servant David, he defends,
From the keen Edge of h^rtful Swords.

Whose Mouths speak Vanity, and Lies;
The plighted Faith of whose Right Hand,
Is naught but Fraud, and Perjuries.

Our Sons, like thriving Plants shall grow;
As polished Pillars Courts surround,
Our blooming Daughters beauteous show.

Of every Kind of pleasant Grains;
Our numerous Flocks increasing more,
In Thousands spread the neighboring Plains.

And no invading Foe be feared,
No Marchings out we sadly know,
Nor Murm'rings in our Streets be heard.

Flourish in such a State as this;
Thrice happy People, that can show,
Their God, the great Jehovah is.
PSALM CXLV.
I WILL Thee extol, my God, and King,
And ever bless thy Name.

With endless Songs, thy Fame.

His Greatness Thought exceeds.

And sing thy mighty (...).

And Wonders thou have done.

Thy Greatness (...) make known.

With cheerful Heart, and Tongue;
Thy Righteousness, in all thy Ways,
Shall be their constant Song.

But unto Anger slow.

His tender Mercies flow.

And Thee thy Saints shall bless:

Thy mighty Power confess.

And Kingdom's glorious State.

Thy Reign's of endless Date.
Second PART.

And raises up the low.

In Season, do bestow.

According to their Needs.

And bountiful in Deeds.

That his kind Aid implore;
He Will none reject that on him call,
And him in Truth adore.

That his great Name revere;
To their Request attend he will,
And save them from th^^^ Fear.

Protection shall enjoy;
But who perversely wicked prove,
He Will utterly destroy.

To sing Iehovah's Fame;
Let all Flesh join the sacred Quire,
And ever bless his Name.
PSALM CXLVI.
PRaise God; my Soul praise thou the Lord.

Through all my Life; whilst that I am,
Praise to my God I Will sing.

Nor on Man's Son, rely.

His Thoughts then with him die.

Of Jacob for his Aid;
Whose Hope upon the Lord, his God,
Alone, is firmly stayed.

With all that they contain;
Who keeps the Truth forever sure
His Promises remain.

For those oppressed that be;
He gives the Hungry Food, the Lord
Does set the Prisoner free.

From burdened Souls removes
Their heavy Loads, and lifts them up;
The Lord the righteous loves.

Widows, and Fatherless;
But up-side down he turns their Ways,
Who wickedly transgress.
Jehovah shall forever reign;
Thy God, O Sion, sways.
The Scepter, while all Ages last
O give Jehovah praise.
PSALM CXLVII.
PRaise ye the Lord; it is good to sing
The Praises of our God, and King;
Praise is the most delightful Theme,
And nothing more becomes our Frame.
Ierus'lem does repair;
And bring his scattered Exiles there.

Binds up their Wounds, allays their Smart.

And calls them by their various Names.

His Understanding's infinite.

But cast the Wicked to the Ground.

And join the Harps melodious String.

Makes Grass to grow on Mounts, and Plains,

And the young Ravens, when they cry.

Of Horse, or Man, takes no Delight.

And those that in his Mercy trust.
Second PART.
Jerusalem, Jehovah, praise;
Sion, thy God, with sacred Lays.

In thee thy Children he has blessed*

And fills thee with the finest Wheat.

His Word, like Lightning, swiftly flees.

His hoary Frost, as Ashes, throws:

And who before his Cold can stand?

The Glebe is loosened from it is Bands;
He bids the warmer Breezes blow;
The Ice dissolves, the Waters flow.

He has revealed to Jacob's Race;
To Israel, whom he chose his own,
His Laws, and Judgments, are made known.

With him, such Favor, ever have found;
To them, he never did afford,
His Judgments. Therefore praise the Lord.
PSALM CXLVIII.
LOUD Hallelujah's sing:
From Heavens Jehovah praise;
His Fame the Empyrial ring,
In the sublimest Lays.

The lofty Song;
His Hosts great Throng,
To praise strike in.

Which rule the Day, and Night;
His Praise be all your Tune,
Ye glittering Stars of Light.

Waters that rise
Above the Skies,
His Praise proclaim.

To praise Iehovah's Name;
For he but spoke the Word,
And they from Nothing came.

From Changes free,
By his Decree;
Which firm shall last.

Ye Dragons, and each Deep;

And Storms, his Word which keep.

Trees bearing Fruit;
Cedars that shoot
So near the Sky.

That creep, or wing the Air;

Princes, and Judges here:

By hoary Heads,
Young Men, and Maids,
And the Infant's Tongue.

In Praise, with one Consent;
Iehovah's Name alone,
Is wondrous excellent:
His Glories far
Above Earth rise,
Transcend the Skies,
And every Star.

And high advanced their Fame;
By all his Saints is praised
His ever glorious Name:
By Isr'el's Race,
A People near,
And to him dear.
Jehovah praise.
PSALM CXLIX.
PRAISE ye the Lord; sing unto God,
A new melodious Song;
Show forth the Honor of his Name,
Assembled Saints among.
Isr'el's Heart, with holy Joy,
In him that made him, spring;
And Sion's Sons their Triumph make,
In their illustrious King.

To praise his holy Name;
The Harp, and Timbrel, join, and sing,
And loud his Praise proclaim.

Whom Sinners treat with Scorn;
With his Salvation, humble Souls,
He Will gloriously adorn.

Let all his Saints rejoice;
And thus secured, upon their Beds,
In Singing, raise their Voice.

Of their almighty Lord;
While their Right Hand does grasp, and wield,
The 'vengefull Two-edged Sword,

And punish those designed;

In Iron Fetters bind.

Which sacred Rolls record;
This Honor all his Saints shall have.
Sing Praises to the Lord.
PSALM CXLIX. 2 d Meetre. Messi'rs a^e and Brady's Version.
O Praise ye the Lord,
Prepare your glad Voice.
His Praise in the great
Assembly to sing.

Let Israel rejoice;
And Children of Sion
Be glad in their King.

Extol in the Dance;
With Timbrel, and Harp,
His Praises express:

His Saints to advance:
And with his Salvation
The humble to bless.

His People shall sing
To God, who their Beds
With Safety does shield.

Of him their great King;
Whilst a two-edged Sword
Their Right Hand does wield.

For Injuries past;
And punish those Lands
For Ruin designed.

To tie their Kings fast;
With Fetters of Iron
Their Nobles to bind.

When them they destroy,
The dreadful Decree
Which God does proclaim;
Such Honor, and Triumph,
His Saints shall enjoy.
O therefore forever
Exalt his great Name.
PSALM CL.
PRaise God: praise him in's House below:
Praise him ye Heavens, his Power which show.

Praise him whose Majesty exceeds.

Praise him with Psalt'ries, Harps soft Voice.

Praise him with Organ, and sweet Lute.

Praise him in Cymbals lofty'st Strains.

Praises eternal to him sing.
THE END OF THE PSALMS.
The SONG of MOSES.
EXODUS XV.
I WILL sing the Triumphs of the Lord,
Who Is glorious in Renown;
The Horse, and him that rode thereon,
He in the Sea has thrown.

My God; for him I Will raise
A Mansion; he my Father's God,
I Will celebrate his Praise.

Jehovah is his Name.
Pharoah's glit'ring Cars, and Host,
Tha^ to the Ravage came,
In the Red Sea he cast; there were
His chosen Captains drowned.

They sank in the Profound.

O Lord, most glorious shows;
Thy Right Hand, Lord, in Pieces dashed
The proud insulting Foes.

Against Thee who presumed;
Thou sendest forth thy flaming Wrath,
Which them, as Chasf, consumed.

Together in an Heap;
They stood upright, in the Mid-sea
Congealed was the Deep.

I will the Spoil divide;
I Will draw my Sword, and them destroy,
Till Lust is satisfied.

The deep Sea over them spread;
In mighty Waters down they sank,
As if they had been Lead.

Thy Holiness exceeds
In Glory; fearful is thy Praise,
And wonderful thy Deeds.

The Earth them swallowed quite.

Which thou redeem'dst with Might:
And thou did guide them, in thy Strength,
Unto thine holy Hill.

Seize Palestina will.
Edom's Dukes shall be amazed,
Moab's mighty Men be struck
With Terror: Canaan's Hearts shall melt,
As the dissolved Brook.

Still, as a Stone, they will ly:
Until thy People, Lord, which ^^ou
Have purchased, shall pass by.

Thy Mountain ^ears it is Head;
The Place, for thy fixed Residence,
Which thou, O Lord, have made:
The chosen holy Place thine Hand,
O Lord, has settled fast.

Forevermore shall last.
Pharaoh's Chariots, Horse, and Men,
Through Seas audacious went;
And the returning Waves in Rage,
The Lord upon them sent:
But Isr'el's Race, a numerous Host,
Under divine Command,
Walked through the Midst of dangerous Seas,
Securely on dry Land.
MIRIAM's ANSWER.

Who Is glorious in Renown;
The Horse, and him that rode thereon,
He in the Sea has thrown.
MOSES's Prophetic SONG. DEUTERONOMY. XXXII.
LET Heaven's wide Arch, while I shall speak,
Give an attentive Ear:
And hear, O Earth! the important Truths
My Mouth shall now declare.

My Speech, as Dew, distills;
As gentle Rains on tender Herbs,
And Showers on grassy Hills.
Iehovah's glorious Name,
Shall publish all abroad;
With awful Reverence, ascribe
Ye Greatness to our God.

His Ways all Judgment are;
A God of Truth, unspotted pure,
And just beyond compare.

Their Spot's, they are not his Sons;
They Are a perverse, and crooked Race,
A Race of wicked Ones.

Do'ye thus the Lord requite?
Thy Father is he not, who bought,
Thee made, and girt with Might?

The Ages past and gone;
Thy Father ask, and Elders, they
Will tell what God has done.

To Adam's Sons their Place;
He set their Bounds with special Eye
To Isr'el's numerous Race.
Jehovah, for his Portion, does
His People high advance;
Jacob he chose the special Lot
Of his Inheritance.
Sinai's Desert howling Waste*
There found him the Most-High;
He led, and taught, and kept him safe,
As the Apple of his Eye.

And chears the feeble Things;
Her Pinions spreads, and takes them up*
And bears them on her Wings.

And lead them in his Care;
And to assist him there wss none,
No foreign God was there.

Rich Fields supply his Want;
To suck sweet Honey from the Rock,
And Oil from the Adamant:

Fat Lambs of Bashan's Brood,
With Goats, and finest Wheat, to eat;
And drink the Grapes pure Blood.
Iesh'run waxed fat and kicked;
High pampered, and adorned,
His Maker he forsook; the Rock
Of his Salvation scorned.

Strange Gods, their fond Delights;
And kindled up his burning Wrath,
With their detested Rites.

They Altars madly reared;
To unknown, new and upstart Gods,
Their Fathers never feared.

Sure thou remember'st not;
The God that formed, and nourished thee,
Thou vilely have forgot.
Jehovah saw, their Deeds
His just Abhorrence moved;
Because a Provocation great
His Sons, and Daughters, proved.

From them I Will hide my Face;
For they are froward Children grown,
A very faithless Race.

Have moved my Jealousy;
My Anger greatly have provoked
With lying Vanity;
Their Rage I Will with a People move,
Who Are only so in Name;
And with a foolish Nation I
Their Anger will inflame.

Which down to Hell shall burn;
The Earth's Increase, and Mountains Base,
Shall into Ashes turn.

My pointed Arrows spend.

With bitter Deaths I Will send:
I Will order Teeth of savage Beasts
Their vital Blood to spill;
The crawling Serpent of the Dust
Shall them with Poison kill.

Shall seize young Men, and Maids,
And slay them, with the sucking Child,
And Men of hoary Heads.

In every distant Coast;
Make their Remembrance among Men
To be entirely lost.

Lest insolently they
Behave; and our high Hand, not God,
Has done all this should say.

Nor Wisdom's Rules attend.

And thought on their last End.

Ten Thousand put to Flight?
Except their Rock had sold them Slaves,
The Lord restrained their Might?

Almighty Rock compare;
Our Enemies themselves must own,
If they the Judges were.
Sodom's vicious Stock,
And from Gomorrah's Fields;
Which brings forth naught but Grapes of Gall,
And bitter Clusters yields.

Venom of Asps congealed.

And with my Treasures sealed.

They Will fall the Time decreed;
Their woeful Day is near at Hand,
Their Misery comes with Speed.

For's Servant Sake repent;
When none shut up, and left, he sees,
And all their Strength is spent.

"You looked to for Defense?
Where Is now your Rock of Strength, in whom
"Ye placed your Confidence?

"And crowned with Wine the Board?
"Now let them rise, Protection give,
"And needed Help afford.

"No God with me I have;
"I kill, revive, I wound, and heal,
"None from my Hands can save.

"Lift up my Hand on high;
"And solemnly I swear, as sure
"As ever live do I.

"And hold on Judgment lay;
"I Will render Vengeance to my Foes,
"My Haters I Will repay.

"Mine Arrows drunk with Blood
"Of slain, and Captives; on their Chiefs
"Revenges I Will make good.

For he will on their Foe
Revenge their Blood; but to his Land
And People, Mercy show.
The Song of DEBORAH. JUDGES V.

His Israel, on their haughty Foes;
When the brave People freely did
Their Lives, for Liberty, expose.

Whilst I to great Jehovah sing;
In sacred Numbers shout the Praise
Of Isr'el's God, the almighty King.
Seir marched in State,
And turned from Edom's losty Towers,
The Earth shook, the Heavens in Thunders dropped,
The Clouds poured down their rapid Showers.

Nor could Iehovah's Presence bear;
So Sinai unknown Terrors felt,
When Isr'el's God was present there.
Shangar's Anath's valiant Son,
And famous Iael's former Days,
The Roads, by Trav'lers were untrod;
Who fearful, walked through secret Ways.

Their Lands uncultivate were laid;
Until I Deborah was raised
And Mother in God's Israel made

Fierce Wars their Gates invaded then;
Was Shield, or Spear, in Isr'el's Tents
Seen among Forty Thousand Men?
Isr'el's Chiefs,
Who offered of their own Accord,
Bravely to join, and head the Troops
In Battle: Blessed be the Lord.

And now secure in Judgment sit.
Ye Trav'lers join the sacred Song,
Who safely go where ye think fit.

Lurking at every wat'ring Place,
Iehovah's righteous Doings, now
May there rehearse, in Songs of Praise:
The truly gracious Actions he
To Isr'el's Villages has shown;
That now the People of the Lord,
Safe to their Borders, may go down.
Deb'rah, wake, excite thy Powers,
His Fame, in sacred Hymns, to spread;
Rise, Barak, thou Abinoam's Son,
Thy captived Foes, in Triumph, lead.
Cannan's Nobles he reduced,
And put beneath his Remnant's Feet;
The Lord, to my Dominion, forced
Their mighty Captains to submit.
Ephraim's Mount there came a Root,
Which with fierce Amalek engaged.
Benjamin followed close, and joined
His Forces, where the Battle raged.
From Machir's Stock, renowned of old,
There come great Captains, famous Men;
And Zebulun sent such as knew
To weild the Sword, and use the Pen.
Isachar
To Deborah their Forces led;
On Foot they marched down to the Vale,
With gallant Barak at their Head.
But Reuben separate remained,
Distant in Mind, much more than Parts:
The Conduct of which potent Tribe
Made great Impressions on our Hearts.

That thou among the Sheepfolds stayed*
Thee, has the Bleating of thy Flocks,
To base Neutrality betrayed?
Truly thy Conduct, Reuben, who
So wholly separate remained;
And would not join so good a Cause,
Our Hearts has grieved, thy Glory stained.
Jordan, Gilead stayed:
And why did Dan in Ships abide?
While Ashur clung to his Sea Shore,
To hide in Creeks, or curb the Tide.
Zebulun, and Naphtali,
Were ready, for the public Good,
In the high Places of the Field,
To risk their Lives, and spend their Blood.
Canaan came,
With Iabin joined, and for him fought,
In Tannach, by Megiddo's Stream;
But lost the Booty which they sought.

Each active in their stated Course,
Exert their Influence, and fought;
Against proud Sis'ra bent their Force.
Kishon swept them off;
That ancient River, here well known
A Brook, now to a River swol'n:
Thou, O my Soul, have Strength trod down!

In hasty Flight, each other wound;
Their Speed is stopped, they tumbling cast
Their mighty Riders to the Ground.
Meroz, said God's Angel, Curse
All bitterly to her belong;
For they refused to help the Lord,
To aid his Arms against the strong.
Iael, Kenite Heber's Wife,
Shall be above all Women-kind;
Her Fame, beyond her Sex, shall spread,
In every Tent, to every Wind.

She gave him Milk, beyond his Wish:
She brought forth Butter to regale,
And served him in a lordly Dish.

Her Right Hand seized the Hammer fast;
Through Sis'ra's Temples drove the Spike,
And then cut off his Head at last.

He fell, down at her Feet lay spread;
Close at her Feet he bowed, he fell,
There where he bowed, he fell down dead.

And cried, impatient for her Son,
Why does his Chariot stay so long?
Why do the Wheels so slowly run?

Yea, eager, she herself replied,

To each a Maid or two, divide?
Is n't Sis'ra choosing, from the Spoils,
Rich Robes, which beauteous Colors deck,
Of Needle Work, on either Side,
Fit to adorn the Conqu'rour's Neck?

In Ruin sink, and perish quite:
But those that love Thee, like the Sun
Be when he marches in his Might.
PROVERBS VIII. Abridg'd.
HARK, It Is the Voice of Wisdom cries,
In every public Place;
To you, O Sons of Men, I call,
Come, taste my heavenly Grace.
Silver, and Gold, and precious Stones,
And all thou can desire,
Bear no Proportion to the Gifts
My Votaries acquire.
Ere Earth, and Seas, and Heavens wide Arch,
Their Being did receive,
I, with the Lord, his chief Delight,
From everlasting live.
The habitable Earth, with Joy,
Appeared in my Sight:
I then beheld the Sons of Men,
And in them took Delight.
Come then, ye Chrildren, hear my Voice;
Be wise, and keep my Ways:
He Is blessed that hears, and at my Gates,
There daily watching, stays.
Who finds me, wins immortal Life,
And with the Lord finds Grace;
But he that sins, wrongs his own Soul;
Who hate me, Death embrace.
ISAIAH II.
Iehovah's House
Shall, in the latter Days,
Above the Tops of Mounts, and Hills,
It Is Head, in Glory, raise:
To it, as Rivers to the Sea,
Shall all the Nations flow.

Let Us to the Lord's Mount go.
There, in the House of Jacob's God,
He Will teach us his pure Ways;
And in his sacred Paths we'll walk,
All our remaining Days:
For out of Zion shall go forth
A Law, that is full of Grace;
And from Ierus^lem, through the Earth,
The Word of God take Place.
Israel, come,
Nor special Favor slight;
Submit to what the Lord reveals,
Walk in his saving Light.
ISAIAH II^

Have now beheld a gloriou^t
On them, who dwelt in Shades of Death,
The Light has shined heavenly bright.

To us the Son of God is given;
Upon his Shoulders shall be laid
The Government of Earth, and Heaven;
His Name is called Wonderful,
The Counselor, the mighty God,
Eternal Father, Prince of Peace:
Peace dearly purchased with his Blood.

But far and wide, over all extend;
And happy Peace, the glorious Fruits
Of his just Reign, shall know no End.
Over David's Kingdom, on his Throne,
To rule, and stablish it secure;
With Judgment clear, and Justice right,
His Reign forever shall endure.
ISAIAH XLV.

I am the Lord alone;
A righteous Lord, thy Savior God,
Besides me there is none.

From every distant Land;
And cordially receive, with Joy,
Salvation at my Hand.

Both true, and righteous are;
That every Knee to me shall bow,
And every Tongue shall swear.

Have Strength and Righteousness;
And to him come; but all his Foes
Shall endless Shame oppress.
Jehovah, Isr'el's Seed
Shall all be justified;
In Thee, shall triumph, while on Earth,
In Heaven be glorified.
ISAIAH LIII.
LORD, who has our Report believed?
Who thy Messiah has received?

In him no Form, or Beauty's found.

From him we turned our Face in Scorn.

When God, we thought, had smit him sore.

Our Trespasses his Griefs procured;
His Chastisement our Peace has bought,
His grievous Stripes our Healing wrought.

We turned, each one, to his own Way;
And God, upon his guiltless Head,
Has all our Crimes, in Mercy, laid.

Nor once complained of his God;
No Lamb, when to the Slaughter come,
Nor Sheep, at shearing, are so dumb.

Who shall declare his Rise, or Seed;
Yet was his Life cut off betimes,
He suffered for my People's Crimes.

And with the Rich, in Death, he is joined;
Because no Violence he had done,
Nor in his Mouth Deceit was known.

When Is Soul a Sin-Off'ring he will give;
He Will see his Seed, prolong his Days,
And prosper in God's Works of Grace.

The Travel of his Soul shall see;
And by his Knowledge justify
Many, for whom he will bleed, and die,

Him high, in lasting Honor, set;
Because he shed his precious Blood,
And interceeds for Sinner's Good.
ISAIAH LV.
HO! every one that thirsts, come,
Where living Waters flow;
Come, buy, eat, drink, my Wine, and Milk,
Though ye no Worth can show.

On empty earthly Toys?
Hear me, and eat the Good; delight
Your Souls with heavenly Joys.

Hear, and your Souls shall live;
I Will, the sure Mercies of my Son,
By endless Covenant, give.

And set him on a Throne.
Gentile Nations thou shall call,
And they to Thee shall run:
Because thy God, the holy One,
Has glorified Thee.

And while he is near, call ye.

And turn unto the Lord;
Our God* in his great M^rcy, will,
With (...), them reward.
LUKE I: The Song of MARY.

Unites her Powers, and Voice.

My Spirit shall rejoice.

Has graciously expressed
Himself: and lo, all Ages shall
From hence forth call me blessed.

And holy is his Name.

From Race to Race, the same.

By what his Arm has wrought;
The Proud he scattered, and their vain
Designs to nothing brought.

And raised up the Low.

In Want were forced to go:
Israel helped, as he,
In Mercy, had decreed;

To Abr'am, and his Seed.
LUKE I. The Song of ZACHARIAS.
Isr'el's God,
Praise be our constant Theme;
Who came to visit his poor Flock,
And them with Price redeem.

His Servant David's Heir:

He did from first declare.

Complete Salvation gain;
And from the Hand of all us hate
Deliverance obtain.

And's holy Covenant mind;

To Father Abr'am, bind.

Fearless, to serve him, give;

Before him, whilst we live.

Shall go before his Face,
The Herald of the Highest styled,
Sent to prepare his Ways.

To make Salvation known.

From high has on us shone:

And in Death's Shade abide;
The Way to Peace, and Happiness,
Our wandering Feet to guide.
LUKE II. The ANGEL's Message, and Song.

Watched over their Flocks, by Night;

And all their Minds affright:

Let Naught disturb your Mind;
Good News I bring you, which shall be*
(...) to all Mankind.
David's Town,
(As sacred Rolls record,)
This very Day a Savior's born,
The promised CHRIST, the LORD.

You Will find (the Seraph said,)
The Babe enwrap'd in swaddling Cloths,
And in a Manger laid.

A numerous shining Throng
Of heavenly Spirits, praising God;
And thus unite their Song.

By Angels round his Throne;
Blessed Peace has visited the Earth,
Good Will to Man is shown.
LUKE II. The Song of SIMEON.

In Peace, thy Servant, to his Rest*

Of thy Salvation, have been blessed.

Open, before all People's Face;
A Light to Gentiles, shining clear,
And Glory to thine Isr'el's Race.
REVELATION I. The Song of JOHN the Divine.

To us, in dying Strains;
Who, by his own most precious Blood,
Has washed away our Stains;

His Father, we adore,
Be Glory, and Dominion, now,
And henceforth evermore.
REV. IV. The Song of the FOUR LIVING CREATURES.

Almighty God's thy Name;
Who was, and is, and art to come,
Eternally the same.
REV. IV. The Song of the ELDERS.

Art worthy to receive;
For thou made all, thy sovereign Will
To all does Being give.
REV. V. The Song of the CHURCH.

And open every Seal;
For thou wast slain, and, by thy Blood,
Redeemed us from all Ill,
To God; from every Nation, Tongue,
And Tribe of humane Birth;

And we shall reign on Earth.
REV. V. The Song of the ANGELS, and CHURCH.

Riches, and Power, to him belong,
Wisdom, and Strength, and Honor high,
Glory, and Praise, from every Tongue.
REV. V. The Song of all the Creatures.

All Blessing, Honor, Glory, Power,
To him that sits on the Throne,
And to the Lamb, forevermore.

In various Places read Desert, and Deserts: Many Errors in Pointing have
slipped the Press, which an intelligent, Reader will easily correct.

To learn to sing, observe these RULES.
1. Learn this Scale (called Gamut.) perfectly. fixed Name Cliff Mark moveable
Name G sol Treble F fa E la D sol C fa B Mi A la Medius G * sol F fa E la D sol
C * fa B Mi Bassus A la G sol F * fa E la D sol C fa B Mi A la G sol F fa
Observe* each Line, and Space, is a distinct Key. B. is Mi's natural Place;
which prod^^^^ two natural Keys, one ending in C. which is sharp, the other in
A. which is flatt^ but to suit the ^arious Tunes to the sire Lines in Treble,
and Bass, the Tune ends in some other Key, and Mi. is then accommodated to its
natural Place by Flatt^ () and Sharps () set at the Beginning of the Tune*
which run through the whole Tune, unless where a contrary Flatt or Sharp is
placed.

2. Find the Mi. Observe, the last Note of the Tune is the Key. A greater Third
(two whole Notes) above the Key* is a sharp Key: a lesser Third (one Note and
half.) above the Key is a flatt Key. In all sharp Keys, the half Note below is
Mi. In all stall Keys, the whole Note above the Key is Mi. or thus. if B Band
BEandA
be flatt, Mi is in E A D
but if F FandC FCandG
be sharp Mi is in F C G


3. Name your Notes right. All Notes above Mi ascending are fa. sol. la. All
below Mi descending are la. sol. fa. Every Eighth is the same. From Mi to fa,
and la to fa, are half Notes. A () raises a Note half a Note higher; a () sinks
it half a Note lower.

4. Keep Time. Common Time is thus marked, *, Triple Time thus 3, or slower
3/2. The Proportion of Time is, thus. * Semibreve * * Minim * * * * Crotchet *
* * * * * * * Quaver
On^ Semibreve is 1 Beats of a Pendulum. A Minim is 2 Beats of a Pendulum. A
Crotchet is 1 Beats of a Pendulum. A Quaver is 1/2 Beats of a Pendulum.
A Prick on the right Side of a Note make it half as long again, as *^ is ** or
***. so *^ is ** or *** etc.

5. Observe your Marks. as * sol re ut. *. Medius. *. Bass Cliff. The Medius is
