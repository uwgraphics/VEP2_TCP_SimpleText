A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS I am imformed that there are French Privateers coming upon this Coast,
I have ordered His Majesty's Ship, The Richmond, to Cruise, for the Defense of
this Province. And for the better strengthening of the said Ship against the
Enemy, and to prevent that Obstruction which may be given to the Trade and
Navigation of this Province, by Impressing of Mariners, (...) own Company of
Granadeers for that Service. Therefore all Mariners, Tradesmen, and others,
may attend the Service of their Imployers, without the least apprehension of
being impressed upon this Occasion.
