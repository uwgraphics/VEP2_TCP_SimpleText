MEAT OUT OF THE EATER: OR, MEDITATIONS Concerning The Necessity, End, and
Usefulness of AFFLICTIONS Unto Gods Children.

All tending to Prepare them (...) and Comfort them under the CROSS.

By Michael Wigglesworth

CAMBRIDGE: Printed by S. G. and M. ^. for John Usher of Boston. 1670.

Toll Crucem. All Christians must be Cross bearers.
If any man will my Disciple ^e,
Let him take up his Cross and follow me
None can with me and mine partak^
Who does not all for me forsake.
Meditation I.
All Christians must be Sufferers
That would be Christ his Followers.
[1]
ALl that resolve to be
Christ's faithful Followers,
Must be contented in this world Acts 14.22. Mat. 10.37, 38. and 16.24, 25.

To be great Sufferers.
They must renounce themselves,
And their own wills deny,
Take up their Cross, and follow Christ
Through Sufferings cheerfully.
[2]
Not only lighter Griefs
Mat. 10.39. Heb. 12.4.
This Cross of ours implies:
But, when the Lord us calls thereto,
Greatest Extremities.
This must be taken up,
(Willingly undergone)
For Christ's dear sake, who suffered more
For our Redemption.
[3]
The Christian that expects
An Earthly Paradise
When Christ bids his take up the Cross
And bear it, is unwise.
We must not on the knee
Be always dandled,
Nor must we think to ride to Heaven
Upon a Feather-bed.
[4]
Our way to Heavenly Rest
Is all against the stream;
We must not sail with Wind and Tide
As too too many dream:
But row against them both
And many Storms endure;
Till we arrive at that sweet Port
Where Saints shall rest secure.
[5]
Our way is up the Hill,
Which mounteth to the Skies:
But that is the way to Death and Hell
Which low and down-hill lies.
It Is easy to Descend,
And down the Hill to roll:
But this is labor to Ascend,
And painful to the Soul.
[6]
But who would not take pain
Against the Hill to climb,
That so they may true Rest attain
And Happiness in time?
Rather then down the Hill
With present ease to run
(As most men do) until they be
Eternally undone.
[7]
Strait is the Way and Path Mat. 7.13, 14. Luke 13 24.

Which leads unto Life:
Heaven is not gained by ^ase and Sloth,
But by an earnest stri^e.
But broad are all the ways
That to Destruction lead,
And many many are the feet
That daily therein tread.
[8]
Let others take their choice,
And run what way they please;
Let them enjoy their Lusts, and take
Their fill of Carnal Ease:
Choose thou the narrow Path,
My Soul, and walk therein;
Thou know this is the only way
Eternal Life to win.
Meditation II.
God does in Mercy scourge his own
In Wrath he others lets alone.
[1]
IF in this narrow Path
And way that is so strait
^et. 4.
You meet with Difficulties great*
Be not disconsolate*
The straitness of the way
Betokens opposition,
Afflictions, Dangers, Crosses, Snares
In this our frail condition.
[2]
These are the Common-Lot
Of all God's Children dear.
Through many Sorrows they must pass
The Lord that truly fear.
There Is no Calamity
Does unto thee befall,
But such as common is to men; 1 Cor. 10.13.

Yea to the best of all.
[3]
Though various are the ways
And sufferings whereby
God does his Children exercise,
Correct, and also try:
Yet all must bear the Cross
Before they wear the Crown; 2 Timothy 2.12.

All must partake of chastening
Whom God vouchsafes to own.
[4]
It is in Mercy then
That God chastises his,
And lets them not Correction want
When as they do amiss.
They are in trouble now
That he may give them rest, Psalm. 94* 12, 13.

When as the Pit shall dug be
For such as them oppressed.
[5]
All that Christ's Members are
Must be made like their Head:
Heb 12.8. Hos. 4.14.
He is a Bastard not a Child
That Is never chastened.
God lets some alone,
(Leaves them to take their course)
And by his Rod reclaims them not;
They sin without remorse.
[6]
They will not cross themselves,
Nor their own wills deny:
God will not cross them, nor correct,
To do them good thereby.
They w^x more impudent,
Eccles 8.11.
And bolder to do evil,
Through God's forbearance, till at length
Mat. 25.41.
He hurl them to the Devil.
[7]
Psalm. 81.11, 12. Psalm. 94.12. Jo^ 7.17, 18. Isaiah 1.
This is a fearful case
To be thus left of God:
Great mercy it is to be subdued
By scourging with the Rod*
My Soul be thankful then
That God thee thus corrects:
Who might have let thee headlong run
With those whom he rejects.
Meditation III.
The third does further hint at the Ends
For which the Lord Affliction sends.
[1]
GOd does chastise his own
In love, their Souls to save:
And lets them not run wild* with them
That no Correction have.
Now as the Rod restrains Prove. 23.14.

From posting down to Hell:
So by the same God does excite
And teach us to do well.
[2]
Affliction is Christ's School Psalm. 94.12.

Wherein he teaches his
To know and do their Duty, and
To mend what is amiss.
For though Afflictions may
Unto the Flesh be painful:
David and other Saints of God
Have found them very gainful.
[3]
Psalm. 119.67.
Before I was chastis'd,
Says he, I went astray:
But since I Have learnt with better care
To keep thy Precepts way.
Ver. 71.
It Is good for me that I
Have been afflicted sore,
That I might learn to know thy Laws
And swerve therefrom no more.
[4]
Isa. 48.10.
These are God's Fining-Pot,
Wherein he melts his Gold,
Consumes the dross and makes it
Malac. 3.2, 3. Dan. 11.35.
More lovely to behold.
These are his Fullers Soap
To wash our spots away,
That being thus refined and washed
Him glorify we may.
[5]
As sharpest Winter Frosts
Do clarify the Air,
And cleanse our Blood, soften the Earth
And it for Seed prepare,
Making it fruitfuller:
So do Afflictions sore
Lev. 26.40* 41.
Correct the rankness of our hearts,
Cl^anse, and subdue them more.
[6]
Much Honey turns to Gall
And Choleric excess;
And too-too-much Prosperity
Breeds Pride and Wantonness: Deuteronomy. 32.15. Isa. 27.9. Heb. 12.1^, 11.

Afflictions purge them out,
Like bitter Aloe,
Which, though unpleasant to the taste,
Far wholsomer may be.
[7]
Full Diet, dainty Fare,
With Idleness and Ease Ezekiel. 16.49, 50.

Heap up bad Humors, and contract
Many a foul Disease,
To Soul, and Body too.
Dangerous, and Troublesome;
Which must be purged out in Time
By some Catholicum.
[8]
Strong Wine makes weak heads giddy
Procuring Drunkenness:
Long Peace and Plenty likewise breed Jer. 5.7, 8.

Intemperance and Excess.
We soon are Surfeted
With strong delicious matter:
And therefore God, who knows our frame,
Mingleth our Wine with Water.
[9]
Afflictions are like Ballast
In The Bottom of a Ship;
For though perhaps without the same
We might more lightly skip:
Yet every little puff
Would quickly set us over,
And sink us in the Ocean Sea
No more for to recover.
[10]
Jer. 4.3, 4.
Our Hearts are overrun
Much like a fallow Field,
Which must be broke and plowed up
Before it fruit can yield:
Psalm. 129.2.3. Jer. 31.18, 19.
Afflictions are God's Plough
Wherewith he breaks us,
Tears up our Lusts, those noisome Weeds,
And fitteth us for use.
[11]
Grace in Prosperity
Lies hid unoccupy'd:
But is by Chastening set to work,
And by the Cross descried.
The Cross to Virtue trains;
It tries, it makes to grow;
It sanctifies, purges and heals;
It humbles and lays low.
Meditation IV.
The fourth by various Arguments
Strives to beat down all Discontents,
And overcome Discouragements.
[1]
SInce then our gracious God
And Father that is above
For such great Ends uses his Rod
In Faithfulness and Love: Heb. 12.6.

Why should thou once repine,
Or murmr at the Cross,
Impatient man? without such blows
Thy Soul would suffer loss.
[2]
Except that need there be, 1 Pet. 1.6.

And thy Soul's health require,
He uses not severity,
Nor stirs up his ire.
He lays on thee no more Job. 34.23.

Then what may reach the End,
And do thy Soul the good for which
He does Affliction send.
[3]
Iam. 3.33.
He that unwillingly
Afflicts the sons of men,
Cannot take pleasure in the grief
Of his own Childeren.
He lays on his no Crosset,
But that they may attain
Some higher good. He sends no losses
But for their greater gain.
[4]
Burning and Cutting 'bide,
Hunger and Thirst endure
Thou will, thy Body from Grim Death,
Or Sickness to recure:
Thy Soul is much more worth,
And its Salvation dear;
Why then what may Soul-health procure
Should thou refuse to bear?
[5]
Christ never flattered thee,
Nor promised Carnal Ease,
Nor worldly Honor, Pleasure, Gain,
Security, o^ Peace.
He told the worst at first,
(It was thine A, B, C)
Man. 16.24.
That every one must bear the Cross
That would his Follower be.
[6]
Why should thou think it strange 1 Pet. 4.12.

To meet with fiery Trial?
Or to be put upon the task
Of serious Self-denial?
Thou owe more to Christ,
Who shed his dearest Blood,
And bare God's Wrath, for to procure
Thine Everlasting good.
[7]
The Son of God himself
By whom the World was made Heb. 5.8, 9. and 12.2, 3.

Took up the Cross, endured Death,
And so our Ransom paid.
He had no need to die;
But we had been undone:
Unless that He our Punishment
And Pain had undergone.
[8]
He past through Sufferings Luke 24.26. Mat. 10.24, 25. Romans 8.26. Gal 3.13. 1
Cor. 15.55, 56.

Into his glorious state:
It Is fit that Members be content
Their Head to imitate.
Himself has born the Curse,
And taken away the Sting:
So that the Cross is now become
A sanctified thing.
[9]
Therefore take up the Cross;
The Rod in meekness kiss:
Be silent and him reverence, who
Thy God and Father is.
Ezra. 9.13. Heb. 12.1^.
Who less afflicts thee,
Then thou deserved have;
Yea and afflicts thee, that so
A gainer be thou may.
[10]
Jer. 30.11. 1 Cor. 10.13.
Measure and Moderation
In Chast'ning he respects;
And none of his beyond their strength
By pain or grief dejecteth.
Although he burn the Dross
Luke 21.18.
He will not waste his Gold:
If with the one hand he cast down;
His other does uphold.
[11]
The smothering smoking Flax
Mat. 12.20.
He Will not extinguish quite:
To break a bruised shaken Reed
Is none of his delight.
He Will not contend for ay,
Isa. 57.16.
Nor evermore upbraid:
Lest that the spirit before him fail,
And Souls that he has made.
[12]
Thou cravest often a pledge Heb. 12.7

Of Christ's free love to thee.
A pledge thou have, if Chastening
Thou bear fruitfullie.
God deals with us like sons
If Scourging we endure,
For unto patient Suffering
He will his sons inure.
[13]
What if thy strength thee fail?
If Sicknesses increase?
If Creature Comforts thee forsake? Psalm. 27.10. Psalm. 46.1, 2, 3.

If dearest Friends decease?
If wants do multiply,
And woes come on amain?
If Men and Devils should conspire
To aggravate thy pain?
[14]
Droop not faint-hearted man,
Thou art not yet undone:
So long as God himself survives, Psalm. 73.26. Judge 14.14.

And is thy Portion.
Out of the Eater He
Will surely bring forth Meat:
And Spiritual Good more sweet then honey
Out of Affliction great.
Meditation V.
The fifth persuades to Patience,
From that rich future Recompense;
Minding us of our Heavenly Rest,
Which should revive us when distressed.
[1]
MEekly to bear Christ's yoke
It is an Honor high:
Thou Christ wilt surely them reward
Who bear it patiently.
For this short Grief of ours,
2 Cor. 4.17.
And our Affliction light
Shall work of glorious Happiness
A far more lasting weight.
[2]
Psalm. 97.11
For just men light is sown
(Reward laid up in store)
Psalm. 126 5.
Who sow in tears shall reap in joy,
And after mourn no more.
They Will one day wear a Crown,
Who now the Cross sustain:
1 Cor. 15 58*
In Christ our Lord no suffering,
Nor labor shall be vain.
[3]
Reign with him long shall they, 1 Timothy 2* 12.

With him that suffer do:
Who follow him in's Death, partake
Shall of his Glory too.
Not that our services Isa. 64 6.

Deserve such recompense:
But he resolves to set forth 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.

His own Munificence.
[4]
Who can expect a Crop
Or Harvest to obtain;
That breaks no ground, that sowes no seed.
That undergoes no pain?
To triumph who can hope
That does the Battle shun?
Eternal Glory whosoever finds,
Must first through rough ways run.
[5]
Thou art a Pilgrim here; (...). 39.12.

This world is not thy home:
Then be content with Pilgrims fare,
Till thou to Heaven come.
What if thou tossed art
With boisterous winds and seas?
Behold the Haven, where thou shall Heb. 4.9.

Enjoy long rest and ease.
[6]
What if thy conflict with
The roaring Lion be?
If thou be called to fight against
World, Flesh, and Devil, all three.
1 John 4.4. Romans 16 20.
Stronger is Christ in thee
Then strongest Enemy,
Who Satan under thy Souls feet
shall tread down speedily.
[7]
Soldier be strong, who fightest
Heb. 2.^0.
Under a Captain stout:
Dishonor not thy conquering Head
By basely giving out.
Endure a while, Bear up,
And hope for better things:
War ends in Peace; and Morning light
Mounts up on Midnights wings.
[8]
Through Changes manifold,
And Dangers perilous,
Isai* 43.2. Heb. 11.14, 16. Mar. 25.34.
Through fiery flames, and water-floods,
Through ways calamitous,
We travel toward Heaven
A quiet Habitation:
Christ shows a Kingdom there prepared
Even from the worlds foundation.
[9]
O Heaven, most holy place,
Which art our Country dear*
What cause have I to long for thee, 2 Cor. 5* 2, 4, 8.

And beg with many a tear?
Earth is to me a Prison;
This Body an useless wight:
And all things else vile, vain, and naught
To one in such ill plight.
[10]
Oh Christ make haste, from bands
Of Sin and Death me free;
And to those Heavenly Mansions
Be pleased to carry me:
Where glorified Saints
For ever are possessed 1 Thessalonians. 4.17.

Of God in Christ their chiefest Good,
And from all troubles rest.
Meditation VI.
Christ's Sufferings are our Copy-book,
Whereon we often ought to look.
[1]
Heb. 12.2, 3.
LEt every suffering Saint
Consider Jesus Christ,
What Sufferings great he under-went,
Who is our Blest-High-Priest.
What Misery can thou name,
He has not undergone,
Who was most innocent and just,
Isa. 53.9.
And naught amiss had done?
[2]
When we are like to faint,
And when our spirits fail;
When discontents, discouragements
And terrors us assail:
When thou art apt to say,
No grief was e're like mine;
Then think of Christ, and sure thou wilt say,
His far exceeded thine.
[3]
Art thou a Prisoner?
Our Lord himself was bound. Mat. 27.2. Chap. 26.65 67, 68.

Art thou disgraced? why, he was scorned
And trampled to the ground;
Blindfolded, spit upon,
Most wrongfully accused,
Reviled, mocked, buffetted, Mat. 27.28, 30.

And wickedly abused.
[4]
Art thou in Poverty?
Why, Christ himself was poor, 2 Cor. 8.9. Mat. 8.20

And had not where to lay his head;
It Is like he gives thee more.
Art thou in Heaviness?
He was a man of Grief; Isa. 53.3. Mat 26.38.

Whose Soul was sorrowful to Death,
To purchase our relief.
[5]
Or do Temptations vex thee?
He tempted was likewise: Heb. 2.18 and 4 15.

He pitieth when such things perplex thee,
And helps thee when thou cries.
Do Sin and Wrath distress thee?
None so distressed as he, Mat. ^^* 46.

Who underwent God's direful wrath,
From wrath our Souls to free.
[6]
If thus our General
Joh. 12.26.
No danger has declined:
Well may his Soldiers be content
Some hardship for to find.
If he has suffered
In whom no guilt was found:
Well may we suffer for our faults,
Whose sins so much abound.
[7]
If God's dear Son has died,
And born his Fathers ire:
Well may the sinful sons of men
Pass through a gentle fire.
Isai. 53.4, 6.
Since only for our sake
All this he under-went:
What cause have we with our light Cross
To be right well content?
[8]
John 18.11.
He drank up all the Dregs,
And bitterest of the Cup:
Gal. 3.13.
The Cup, he gives us, is allayed,
And but a little sup.
Oh then my sinful Soul!
If Christ to suffering call,
Take up thy Cross, and willingly
Follow thy General.
Meditation VII.
The worldly man's Prosperity
Is only gilded Misery.
[1]
ALthough God's dealings are
Exceeding various
Respecting outward things, which be
Adverse or Prosperous;
That none can certainly Eccles. 9.1, 2.

Discern God's Love or Hate,
By being in Affliction,
Or in a Prosperous state:
[2]
(For now and then a Saint
Enjoyes Prosperity:
And sometimes wicked men are plagued,
And are in Misery)
Yet commonly we see Acts 14.22. Job 21.7, 8, 9, 10, 13.

Affliction is the Lot
Of precious Saints; whilst others thrive
In The world, who serve him not.
[3]
They are afflicted less
Then God's own Children dear:
Psalm. 17.14.
And it is no wonder, if we mind,
They have their Portion here.
Yet silly sinful flesh
Psalm. 73.3, 4, 5.
At this is apt to grumble:
And at the scandal of the Cross
There are too many stumble.
[4]
They flourish like a Tree;
They have the world at will:
Job 21.24.
Their Breasts are flowing-full of milk;
Marrow their bones does fill.
They have no sorrows great
Their vigor to decay:
Nor is their Moisture radical
Consumed and sweal'd away.
[5]
While better men are sick,
Their bodies are in health:
Whilst others are distressed with wants,
They flow in worldly wealth.
They have their time of peace,
While others are in trouble.
If other men have Plenty too,
They have it more then double.
[6]
They live and lie at ease, Amos 6.4, 5, 6.

While others are in pain:
And meet not with Calamity
Their mirth for to restrain.
While godly men are weeping,
And laying sin to heart:
They Are feasting, singing, or else sleeping,
Because they fell no smart.
[7]
Their eyes stand out with fat; Psalm. 73.7

They Have more then heart can wish:
Honey and milk, butter and oil
Do drop into their dish.
The World them dandleth,
Like Darlings on her lap,
And streams delights into their mouth
From this and the other Pap.
[8]
They prosper in their way, Psa. 37.7.

And bring their ends to pass,
Judging themselves as happy men, Psa. 49.18.

As ever any was.
Because they have success,
They bless themselves therein:
They think God loves, and favors them,
Though they still love their sin.
[9]
Psalm. 55.19.
Because they have no changes,
Therefore they fear not God:
They do not dread to anger him,
Because they feel no Rod.
Eccles 8.11.
God does not execute
His Sentence speedily
Against wicked works: therefore they are bold
To do more wickedly.
[10]
God gives them outward things,
And they the same bestow
Jam 4.3. Luke 16.13.
Upon their Lusts: they serve the world,
And unto Mammon bow.
In him they put their trust;
Him they most highly prize:
Unto this Idol every day
They offer Sacrifice.
[11]
For having made the World
The God whom they adore,
They rake and scrape, they pill and pull,
and covet more and more.
The World does fill their Head,
And occupy their Heart:
But God, to whom both these belong,
They leave for him no part.
[12]
Their Riches make them proud, 1 Timothy 6.17.

And puff them up in mind:
Their Plenty does besot them too,
And make them worse then blind.
They see no need of Christ, Rev. 3.17 Mat. 19.22, 23, 24.

But by his Grace set light:
Despise a Savior, shut their eyes
Against the Gospel's Light.
[13]
They being fat and full Deuteronomy. 32.15.

Are wanton, Jesurun-like;
They kick and spurn against God's Love,
And at his Bowels strike.
Whilst he them nourishes, Isa. 1.2.

Against him they rebel:
And under Satan's Banner fight, John 18.44.

Like wicked Imps of Hell.
[14]
Thus their Prosperity, Prove. 1.32.

Through God Almighty's Curse,
Does make them wax more insolent,
And grow still worse and worse.
Their Table is their Snare, Psalm. 69.22.

Their Delicates a Bait
Which leads them to turn Belly-gods,
And grow Intemperate.
[15]
Prove 23.31, 33.
Their overflowing Cups
Entice to Drunkenness:
And then expose to filthy Lust
Their pampered Carkases.
The greater strength they have:
The stronger to do evil.
The healthfuller their Bodies be:
More fit to serve the Devil.
[16]
2 Chronicles. 36.15, 16 Ezekiel. 23.9, 10, 11.
God warns them by his Word;
They Are deaf and do not hear:
He cuts down others with his Sword;
They neither feel nor fear.
Isa. 42.25 Jer. 5.3.
If God vouchsafe to scourge them,
Yet they like Madmen feel not:
Or if they feel, their hearts are hard;
Repent, and turn they will not.
[17]
Exodus 8.27, 28. compared with 34.
Whilst that the smart is on,
Perhaps they promise fair:
But, Pharaoh-like, when respite comes,
They show you what they are.
2 Pet. 2.22.
To wallowing in the mire
Like filthy unclean Hogs,
And to their vomit back again
They run, like greedy Dogs.
[18]
Since then they choose their Bane,
And will no warning take:
They have their choice, and may thereof
Their best advantage make.
God will no more take pains Isa. 1.5. Hos. 4.14.

To scourge them for their sin:
But lets them glut themselves therewith,
And end as they begin.
[19]
He winketh at their faults,
And lets them take their course;
Yea gives them up unto their lusts, Psalm. 81.11, 12. Mat. 23.32. Mat. 25.41.

To sin without remorse:
Till having filled their measures,
The Lord to Judgment call;
Where opening all his fiery Treasures,
He Will pay them once for All.
Meditation VIII.
Saints happier be when most distressed,
Then wicked men are at the best.
[1]
WE have the Wicked viewed,
And seen his best estate:
And who would choose with him to share,
Except a Reprobate?
Prove. 1.32.
For sure the Simple's ease
Shall turn to his decay:
And the Prosperity of Fools
Shall utterly them slay.
[2]
Psalm. 92.7.
When wicked men like Grass
Do springing up arise,
When they are in a flourishing case
That work iniquities:
It Is for their cutting down
To perpetuity;
It Is but to ripen them for woe,
And endless misery.
[3]
The less Affliction here Luke 16.23, 24, 25.

They feel, the more's to come
The greater Blessings they abuse,
The heavier is their Doom.
Now let us take a Saint
Whom men account accursed,
Because they judge him plagued of God.
And view him at his worst.
[4]
Suppose his case as bad,
As bad it well can be:
And his Calamity more sad
Then commonly we see.
Dispose him where you will,
Do with him what you can:
Yet God is present with him still
He is a happy man.
[5]
Let Sickness come upon him,
Or great Tormenting Pain:
God will not lose him, Jam. 5.11. Acts 23.11.
but a Saint
A Saint shall still remain.
In Prison him immure,
All comforts from him take:
You cannot rob him of his God,
Nor him unhappy make.
[6]
Isa. 43.2.
Plunge him into the mire,
Or water; God is near:
Cast him into the burning Fire;
Psalm. 42.7.8.
God will be with him there.
If many roaring waves
Of great Affliction roll
Over his head: God so supports
They cannot sink his Soul.
[7]
( Jacob in servitude,
Joseph in Prison Chains,
Moses in his long Banishment
Heaven's Favorite still remains.
Three Children in the Fire
Daniel in the Lions Den
Have God to guard them: so had Paul
When Shipwrack'd. Happy Men!)
[8]
Deuteronomy. 33. 27.
The Everlasting Arms
Are underneath his head
To bear him up; and hence it comes
He is not swallowed,
Psalm. 44.17, 18, 22
Nor suffered wickedly
From God to turn aside:
As by his carriage will appear
When troubles him betide.
Meditation IX.
The Carriage of a Child of God
Under his Fathers smarting Rod.
[1]
HE sees a hand of God
In his Afflictions all, Job. 1.21. and 2.10.

And owns it for to be his Rod,
Whatever Cross befall.
For whosoever be
The immediate Instrument, 2 Samuel 16.11.

He knows right well that God himself
was the Efficient.
[2]
And that Afflictions Job 5.6.

Rise not out of the Dust:
Nor are they ordered by (...) will
Of Man, or Devils lust.
If that the Grief be small
Or the Chastisement light:
Yet since God sends it not in vain, 1 Kin. 22.48, 49.

Light strokes he dare not slight.
[3]
If greater be the Blow,
H^b 12.5, 6.
It does not him dismay:
Because he knows a Fathers hand
Such stripes may on him lay.
Joel 2 12 Amos 4.12.
But he prepares himself
Betimes to meet the Lord
By true Repentance, as he has
Commanded in his Word.
[4]
Lam. 3.39, 40 42 Job. 10.2. Job 34.31, ^2. Job 36.8, 9, 10, 11, 15. Job 42.6.
To search and try his ways,
To find out what is amiss,
To leave his sins, to loath himself
His first great Business is.
And having once found out
What sin has God offended;
He seriously bewails it, and
Endeavors to amend it.
[5]
Heb. 6.18.
Unto the cleansing Blood
Of Jesus Christ he flies;
Psalm. 51.7.
And to his wounded Conscience
That Sovereign Balm applies:
Which can both Cleanse and Heal;
1 John 2.2. Heb 9 14 Re^ ^ 5.
Both pacify God's wrath,
And cure a guilty Sin-sick Soul,
When it is improved by Faith.
[6]
And though he be unworthy
To look God in the face;
Yet through the Merits of his Son Heb. 4.15, 16. Job 19.25* 26 27. Lam 3.31,
32.

He begs and hopes for Grace:
Being right well assured
That though the Lord chastise him;
Yet will he not cast off his Soul,
Nor utterly despise him.
[7]
But if by all his search
He cannot find the cause
For which the Lord afflicts him,
Or from his Soul withdraws:
Yet he believes, that
For just and holy ends,
To humble, purge, and better him
The Lord Affliction sends.
[8]
And though he cannot say, Job 10.2, 7.

I have at random run,
Or wickedly by some known sin
Away from God have gone: Job 7.^0 Job 9.2, 3.

Yet so much sin he sees
Both in his heart and ways,
As God may judge it meet therefore
To scourge him all his days.
[9]
1 Pet. 5.6.
Himself he humbles under
The mighty hand of God:
1 Samuel 3.18. Job 2.10.
And for the sake of that sweet hand
Does kiss the sharpest Rod.
He takes up his Cross,
Denies his own will,
Advances God's above his own,
And yields to him still.
[10]
Lam. 3.29, 30.
Unto the yoke of Christ
He does his neck submit:
He turns his cheek to him that smites,
And meekly takes it.
Lam. 3.22, 23, 25.
Yea when his grief is most,
And sorest is his pain:
He still endeavors good thoughts
Of God for to retain.
[11]
His earnest care and prayer
When greatest is his smart,
Is that he never may blaspheme
God with his mouth or heart.
He beggeth Patience
In his extremities
To bear Gods hand, that so his heart
may not against him rise.
[12]
If murmuring thoughts do rise Psalm. 73.13 14, 15, 22.

(Or heart begin to swell)
He strives to beat them down again;
He hates such thoughts like Hell.
God he resolves to love,
Deal with him as he will:
And in his Mercy to confide Job 13 15.

Although he should him kill.
[13]
To God that smites him
He strives to get more near.
He will not cease to pray, Psa. 88.1.2 9 13. Psa^. 42.7, 8, 9.
although
God seem to stop his ear.
Though God has long delayed
To answer his request,
Yet will he seek, and never cease,
Whilst life is in his breast.
[14]
He waits patiently Psalm. 46.1 2, 4.

Until deliverance come,
And will not use dishonest means Isai 28.16.

To shun what is troublesome.
He hates all sinful sleights
To get his Cross from under:
He will not break his Bonds, Psalm. 116.16.
but stay
Till God them out asunder.
[15]
Genesis 8.13, 14, 16.
Noah would not leave his Ark,
Nor out of Prison break,
Although he saw the ground was dry,
Till God did to him speak.
1 Samuel 26.9, 11.
David refused to kill
King Saul his mortal Foe,
That persecuted him to Death,
And wrought him so much woe.
[16]
He rather chose to wait
Till God should plead his Cause,
And of his Enemy him avenge,
Then for to break God's Laws.
Thus every Saint will rather
Job 36.21.
Choose Suffering, then to Sin:
He will not God offend Self-ease
or Safety for to win.
[17]
Mat. 26.70; 75.
But if through Humane frailty,
And over-bearing power
Of strong Temptation, he do swerve
And fall in the evil hour:
(As sometimes Peter did)
Luke 22.32.
It grieveth him full sore,
He weeps and mourns, repents, returns,
Grows stronger then before.
[18]
The longer God afflicts him, Psalm. 119.67, 71. Eccles. 7.3.

The better he is for it:
Love's Holiness the more, loath's sin
And learneth to abhor it.
The more he is bereft
And stripped of outward things:
The less he dotes on these wild Fowl
That take them to their wings.
[19]
When Creature Comforts fail;
When sorrows him surround,
He takes the faster hold of God
In whom true Comfort's found.
When Conduit-pipes are stopped,
When Streams are vanished:
The more he to the Fountain hastes,
And lives at the Wellhead.
[20]
Thus David comforted 1 Samuel 30.6.

And cheered himself in God
When all was gone: although he felt
The anguish of the Rod.
Thus Jacob took fast hold Genesis 32.26 28.

And wrestled with the Lord,
When as he was distressed for fear
Of cruel Esau's Sword.
[21]
Prince-like he wrestled
And would not let him go,
Until he had a Blessing got
To shield him from his Foe.
Thus every suffering Saint
By wrestling shall prevail,
And having overcome at last
Be styled Israel.
Meditation X.
Although Afflictions tanne the skin,
Such Saints are Beautiful within.
[1]
Cant. 2.14.
HOw amiable is
The face of suffering Saints,
Where God thus quieteth their hearts
And stilleth their complaints!
Where it is their daily care,
And earnest hearts desire,
To love, and bless, and honor God
In midst of the fire.
[2]
Where nothing grieves them more Psalm. 139.21, 22, 23, 24.

Then what their God does grieve:
Where nothing pleases them like that
Which makes them sin to leave.
Where though they have a will
And wishes of their own:
Yet at the foot of Jesus Christ Mat. 16.24.

They meekly lay them down.
[3]
These are the happy men,
Judge of them what thou please Jam 5.11 compared with Job 42.6, 7, 8.

Vain world; Amongst thy Darlings all
Thou have not one like these.
As God is dear to them,
So they to him are dear:
And he to all the world ere long
Will make it to appear.
[4]
The Daughter of the King Psalm. 45.13.

All glorious is within,
How black soever and Sunburned
May seem her outward skin.
Because I blackish am Cant. 1.5, 6.

Upon me -- look not ye
Because that with his beams the Sun
Has looked down on me.
[5]
A patient suffering Saint
Is a right comely one:
Though black as Kedar's Tents, and as
Curtains of Solomon.
Thus beautify my Soul
Dear Savior; thus adorn it.
As for the Trappings of the world,
And Bravery, I can scorn it.
[6]
Mat. 23.25, 26, 27, 28.
Some deck the outside fair;
But are like Graves within:
Some sweep and wash their houses clean,
Whose hearts most nasty been.
Some bodies fat and fair
Have Souls both foul and lean:
But howsoever my Body fare,
Lord make my Soul more clean.
A Conclusion Hortatory To those that are, or hereafter may be in Affliction.
[1]
ANd now, my Christian Friend,
That shall these Lines per use;
Oh that they might thine heart persuade
The Cross of Christ to choose!
And to esteem it more
Then greatest Worldly Treasures!
Light grief would bring thee glorious joys, 2 Cor. 17.

Short pain Eternal Pleasures.
[2]
I have endeavored
The Cross for to adorn,
By setting forth its comeliness,
Although the world it scorn.
I have discoursed in brief
What profit comes thereby,
That thou might be encouraged
To bear it patiently.
[3]
I have before thine eyes
An humble gracious Saint
Bearing the Cross upon his back
Endeavored to paint.
Now strive to imitate;
After this Copy write:
This is the only end for which
I did the same endite.
[4]
I would not for this world,
Were it a world of Gold,
(Yea for a thousand times as much,
And more then can be told)
I would not Rules prescribe
And unto thee commend,
And yet my self be negligent
Those Rules for to attend.
[5]
It is my daily Prayer,
Lord let me never teach
That unto others which my self
Have little care to reach.
I have not told thee Tales
Of things unseen, unfelt,
But speak them from Experience;
Believe it how thou will.
[6]
Yet I shall tell the Truth,
And nothing from thee keep;
Before I wrote this sentence out
I sat down twice to weep
Tears of remorse and sorrow
Because I am so poor
In these rich graces, and because
I have attained no more.
[7]
That having been so long
A Scholar in this School,
I have so little progress made,
And been so great a fool.
But I shall say no more,
But pass from this discourse.
My weeping tears do blind mine eyes,
And me thereto enforce.
[8]
My son despise not thou Heb. 12.5.

The Lords chastising hand,
Nor faint when thou corrected art:
But turn at his command.
Oh be not obstinate
(No better then before)
Lest God provoked be to smite, Lev. 26.18.

And lay on seven times more.
[9]
For thus he threateneth;
Verse 23, 24.
If that ye will not be
By all my strokes reformed yet
But still walk cross to me:
Then will I also walk
Contrary unto you
In wrath and fury, and seven times
More Plagues will on you throw.
[10]
Dear Brother, Christian Friend,
Be wise for thine own ease,
And do not wilfully thy God
And Father mild displease.
Lam. 3.33, 34.
He loves not to grieve,
Nor crush the sons of men:
Why should thou love to anger him,
Or for to grieve him then?
[11]
It may be thou have been
Some headstrong Bullock like*
Kicking and spurning at the Rod,
And running on the Pike.
Now ^^en bemoan thy self;
And cry, Lord turn thou me,
That have a stubborn sinner been,
And turned I shall be.
[12]
If Ephraim thus repent
And pray; God quickly hears, Jer. 31.18, 19, 20

Embraces him as his dear Child,
And wipes away his tears.
God listeneth for to hear
The voice of true returners,
And is most ready to speak peace
To brokenhearted mourners.
[13]
Oh let New England turn,
When gentler Warning's given:
Lest by our sins the Lord to use
Severity be driven.
It will be to our cost
To put him thereupon:
Oh therefore let us repent in time,
Before we be undone.
[14]
Incorrigibleness
God's Anger will increase:
True Penitence, and Faith in Christ,
This anger will appease;
And nothing else can do it.
Lord give us hearts to say,
Turn us to thee, Hos. 14.2.
and all our sins
Purge out and wash away.
[15]
Hos. 6.1, 2.
Come let us return to God,
He has us torn, He Will heal:
He has us smitten with his Rod,
And bind us up he will.
After two days are past
He will us so revive,
And on the third day raise us up
That we in's sight shall live.
Psalm. 80.19.
Turn us again Lord God of Hosts,
And make thy countenance
To shine upon us, and so we
Shall have deliverance.
Amen.
RIDDLES UNRIDDLED, OR Christian Paradoxes Broke open, smelling like sweet

Good Company,

Heavenly Crowns for

Light in Darkness.
Light in Darkness follows next,
Which holds forth Comfort from the Text
To such as are in mind perplexed,
And with Temptations strangely vexed.
SONG I.
[1]
THus far in general
About Afflictions,
Wherewith the Lord will exercise
All whom he owns for sons.
Now of particular Ailes
And Exercises great
(Such as most commonly befall)
We purpose to entreat.
[2]
P^ov. 18.14.
The Spirit of a man
Will many Griefs sustain:
But who can bear a wounded Sp'rit?
This is the greatest pain.
First then for Spiritual Griefs,
Temptations, and distresses,
Wherewith the Devil keeps down,
And some good Souls depresses.
[3]
Isa. 50.10, 11.
There is a child of Darkness
That walks in the light,
That thinks his ill state very good
And therein takes delight.
There is a child of Light
Whose state is very good,
Yet walks in sadness, in the night,
Till this be understood.
[4]
Thick Clouds sometimes arise
And darken the Noonday:
A Mist may blind Believers eyes,
They cannot see their way.
Although they walk in Light,
Satan so undermines
Their Comfort, that they see no Light
Which round about them shines.
[5]
Sometimes they doubtful are
Concerning their estates:
Sometimes conclude against themselves
That they are Reprobates.
Such things may Saints befall;
Yet are they never left
Of God, nor of his awful fear
Are utterly bereft.
[6]
They dare not wickedly Jonah 2.4. Psalm. 88.1, 2, 3, etc Is^. 42.3.

Away from God depart,
But after his sweet presence mourn,
And seek him with their Heart.
Such bruised trembling Reeds
Christ will in no wise break:
But in the most accepted time Chap 61.1, 3.

will comfort to them speak.
[7]
He will into a flame
Blow up their little spark,
And make his face on them to shine
That now are in the dark*
For he will not cast (...), I^a. 5^.15* 16.

Nor evermore forsake
Those that rely on him for grace,
And him their Portion make.
[8]
Come, poor distressed Souls,
And hear your Grievances:
Learn how you may with Spiritual Arms
Temptations force repress.
Hear what the Flesh suggests
For your discouragement:
Learn what the Spirit may reply
Soul-sinkings to prevent.
SONG II.
Being a Dialogue wherein the Speakers are Spirit and Flesh.
Spirit. [1]
Psalm. 42.5, 11.
MY Soul what aileth thee
Thus heavily to droop,
And under thine Affliction
Dejectedly to stoop?
Art thou the only man
That has Affliction seen?
And have not better men then thou
As much afflicted been?
[2]
Have thou no part in God?
Or does he cease to love thee?
If neither this, nor that be so,
What can so greatly move thee?

Flesh. I heretofore did hope
My sins were pardoned
Through God's free grace, that all my debts
were wholly cancelled:
[3]
That Christ had satisfied
For me, and cleared the score;
That God was therefore reconciled
And would be wroth no more:
Yet now he hides his face
And on me seems to frown;
He will not hear my suit for grace,
But wounds and casts me down.
[4]
He writes bitter things, Job 13.26.

And makes me to possess
My sins of youth: to mind he brings
My faults and trespasses.
Will God cast off from ay? Psalm. 77 78.

And Anger still retain?
Will he depart even quite away,
And no^ return again?

Spirit. [5]
John 13.1.
Where Christ once sets his love
He loves to the end,
And nothing can him change or move
From being still our Friend.
God cannot cease to love,
Where once he did begin:
Although he may with stripes reprove
And chasten thee for sin.
[6]
Be humbled for thy falls,
My Soul, and turn to God,
(...). 3.12.
Who from thy wanderings thee recalls
By this his gentle Rod.
Attend unto his voice,
Return to him that smites
(...). 3.11, 12.
For good; who every child corrects
In whom his Soul delights.
[7]
Fathers may chide and whip
Their Children till they smart:
But whilst their hand inflicteth stripes,
They pity with their heart.
They cast not off a Child,
Although they angry be:
Nor does thy Heavenly Father mild
Reject and cast off thee.

SONG III.
Another Dialogue or Combat between the Flesh and Spirit.
Flesh. [1
OH but I greatly fear,
My sufferings are not such
As Childrens Nurture use to be,
But that they differ much.
They are too great and long
(I fear) to stand with love:
Such overwhelming strokes, methinks,
Do rather hatred prove.
[2]
Were I a Child of God
He would more gently deal:
Nor would he always use the Rod,
But sometimes help and heal.
But I am day by day
Afflicted very sore:
My sufferings have been many years,
And still are growing more.

Spirit. [3]
God does more gently deal
Then thou considerest well:
Lam. 3.22, 23.
For had he used extremities
Thou had been now in Hell.
He is not so severe
As thou imaginest;
For some, that were to him most dear,
Have been much more distressed.
[4]
Genesis 27.43* 44. (...) Genesis 31.28, 41.
Jacob from Esau's rage
To Padan-Aram sent,
The toil and pain of twenty years
Hard service under-went;
Often being circumvented
By Laban's subtle feats:
But he was fain to be contented
For he knew no deceits.
[5]
Genesis 32.6, 7. Chap. 34.^* 30. Chap. 35.^^, 22. (...).
Thou know what sorrows great
He after passed through,
One trouble hardly over-blown
Before he met a new*
Moses brought up a Prince,
From Egypt Banished
Lived in Exile forty years,
And labored for his bread.
[6]
Joseph an innocent, Genesis 27.28.

Through Bretherens cruel hate,
Was sold to strangers, and so brought
Into a servile state.
No sooner gains he favor
In The eyes of Potiphar:
But is accused of that Crime, Genesis 39.17.

Which he did most abhor.
[7]
His Master is incensed, Verse. 19* ^^. Psalm. 105.18.

The innocent is shut
Into a Dungeon dark, his hands
And feet in fetters put.
And though the Lord was pleased
This rigor to abate
After some time; yet dwelt he long
In this imprisoned state.
[8]
The Church was sore oppressed Exodus* 1.14.

In Egypt many a day,
And made like Slaves, with rigor too,
To serve in brick and clay.
And though they cried to God Exodus 2.23.

With groans and many tears:
Yet were they in this Bondage held
Above an hundred years.
[9]
Read Job 1st and 2d (...)
What think thou of Job
And his great Sufferings?
Do not thy griefs, compared with his,
Seem light and little things?
So dismal was his case,
So strange his sorrows all,
Job 4.7. compared with
As Wise ones thought could unto none
But wicked men befall.
[10]
Job 42.7, 8.
But God befools them for it,
And lets them understand
That Job was such an upright man,
As none was in the Land:
That notwithstanding all
That he had undergone
For a long time, yet was he still
His most beloved one.
[11]
David a man of God,
One after God's own heart,
In his long lasting Banishment
Of sorrows had his part;
Deprived of God's House,
1 Samuel 26.1, 18, 19.
Hunted from place to place,
With restless feet and weary steps
Forced up and down to trace:
[12]
Flying to save his life,
In Caves and Forests hiding*
Until at length in Ziklag-Town ^ Sam. 27.6. Chap. 3^.3^.

He found some safe abiding.
E're long his Town is burnt,
His Wives are Captive taken,
His Soldiers speak of stoning him,
He seems of all forsaken.
[13]
Had David said, God hates me,
In this his greatest need
When as all other Comforts failed,
He had been poor indeed.
But in his deep distress,
And over-bearing grief,
He comforted himself in God,
And from him found relief.
[14]
Heman from youthful years Psalm. ^^.

Was ready for to die,
Distracted with amazing fears
He cries continually;
Complaining that the Lord
His face away did hide,
Had made his wrath pass over him,
And cast his Soul aside.
[15]
Yet Heman was a Saint,
And calls the Lord his God,
Verse 1.
God of his Health, 'midst all complaints
And lashes of the Rod.
Take courage then my Soul,
And put away thy fear:
Thy sufferings well may stand with love,
Although they greater were.
[16]
And as for length of Time;
Examples do thee show,
That diverse Saints have Sufferers been
A longer time then thou:
So that it well appears,
That alters not the case,
(Of man's short life the longest Time
Is but a little space)
[17]
For what are twenty years
Unto E^ernity?
Eternal Rest will make amends
For all this Misery.
When Time shall pass away
Like an untimely Birth,
These transient Griefs shall be forgot,
Or thought upon with mirth.

SONG IV.
A Dialogue wherein the Speakers are Distressed Conscience and Rectified
Judgment.
Consc. [1]
It Is not Affliction barely
That does my Soul distress:
But rather multitude of sins Psalm. 38.3*4.

And mine own wickedness.
Nor is it former faults
That now are brought to mind,
So much, as swarms of present sins
And hateful Lusts I find.
[2]
Had ever any one
So vile a heart as mine?
So barren under all God's pains
Nurture and discipline?
The Saints of God have found
Affliction to sever
Their Souls from sin; but I find mine
More boisterous now then ever.
[3]
Ezekiel. 24.^3.
This makes me greatly fear
And question mine estate;
Lest I be nothing else but dross
Jer. 6.28, 29, 30.
And silver reprobate,
That is not purified
By passing through the fire,
Fit to be trampled under foot
And trodden in the mire.

Judgment. [4]
Conscience, this is a Time
Wherein thou art benighted,
And see not things as formerly,
Because thou art dim-sighted.
Job 33.23.
Now therefore haste to some
Thy doubts that answer may:
Or for the present hark to me,
And hear what I shall say.
[5]
While Physic is at work,
Ill Humors are disturbed:
So while Chastisements are at work,
Corruptions may be stirred.
They do but show what was
Within the heart before:
They may discover hidden Lusts,
They do not make them more.
[6]
God has ordained the Rod Prove. 3.11, 12.

To do his Children good;
And this the Saints in God's due time
Have felt, and understood:
Not always presently,
And while the smart is on: Job 3. Psalm 77.2, 3, 4, 7.

For some of them have then cried out,
As if they were undone.
[7]
No chast'ning joyous is, Heb. 12.11.

But seems at present hard:
Yet brings forth fruits of Righteousness,
And sweet Peace afterward.
Therefore my sinful Soul,
And doubting Conscience,
Hope well for after-fruit; and do'nt
Judge all by present sense.
[8]
Gods Physic is at work
To purge Corruption out:
And this in time he will effect,
Believe and do not doubt,
He first discovers sin,
Shows thee what wanting is,
Makes thee to feel thy need of help,
And mourn for what is amiss.
[9]
This is some hopeful fruit,
And do not this despise:
J^b 42.6.
For God is making thee more vile
And base in thine own eyes.
Builders may be at work
Before thou see a Stone:
God may be working good for thee,
Though thou discernest none.

Consc. [10]
Oh but my heart is hard,
(...). 63.17.
Much like the Adamant:
It cannot weep, nor mourn for sin,
Nor pour out its complaint.
It cannot kindly melt,
Though daily sins abound
In thought, affection, word, and deed,
Which Conscience prick and wound.

Judgm. [11]
There may be tenderness
Compare Is^ 63.17 with Chap. 64 6, 7, 8.
Where hardness most is felt:
And notwithstanding want of Tears
The heart may truly melt.
All are not brokenhearted
That store of Tears can weep:
And some that have them not, may have
Humiliation deep.
[12]
He that bewails his sins Psalm 51.2, 3* 4, 7, 10. Isa. 1* 16, 17, 18.

Because they God offend,
That tr^^ly hates them, Pardon begs,
Endeavors to amend:
That flies to Christ for grace
To mortify his Lust, Jer. 3^.18* 19.

That mourns because he mourns no more;
This man repents I trust.
[13]
Does not my Soul do thus
(Speak Conscience) day by day?
I know that thou will speak the truth:
Thou can not this gainsay.
Well then be comforted,
And doubt not of thy state*
But still endeavor every sin
More thoroughly to hate.
[14]
And labor for to taste Ephesians. 3.^8, ^9.

The sweetness of Christ's love*
Nothing can m^lt the heart lik^ ^h^s Psalm. 119.135, 136.

Sweet Sunshine from abo^e*
This can the Rock dissolve,
And make the waters flow
Out of the hardest flinty Heart, 1 John 4.1^*

Where never good did grow.

SONG V.
A Dialogue between the Flesh and Spirit.
Flesh. [1]
BUt oh methinks the Lord
Is angry with my Prayers,
The more I cry to him for help
The worse it with me fares.
The more I sue for grace
And beg for some relief:
The more he lets me be distressed,
And doubled is my grief.
[2]
I fear he reckons
My Prayers to me, for sin,
And rather is displeased therewith.
Then takes delight therein.
If God reject my Prayer,
I fear he me rejects.
For how can he despise their Prayer
Whose persons he respects?

Spirit. [3]
Against his people's Prayers
The Lord sometimes may smoke, Psalm. 8^.4.

When some sin unrepented of
His anger does provo^e* Psalm 66.18.

If David sin regard
God will not hear his Prayer:
To search for, find out, mourn for sin, L^m ^.40.

My Soul make this thy care.
[4]
God puts thee upon search, Josh. ^.1^.14.

Would have thee diligent
To find out what offensive is*
And to be Penitent.
Be thou displeased with s^n, Jer 3.12, 13, 14, 22. Chap. 3^.19.20.

And he will be pleased with* thee:
He Will turn to thee his face, if thou
Turn from iniquity.
[5]
Sometimes the Lord delays*
And makes us long to wait*
For other ends* as for to make
Us more importunate, Mat. 15.23, 24* to 29.

To try our Self-denial,
Our Faith, Love, Patience.
Sometimes to make his Power shine forth
In-our deliverance.
[6]
He lets our troubles grow
Exodus 14. and 15 Chapters.
Unto the greater height,
That his Salvation might appear
More glorious in our sight.
For these, and other more,
Such great, and gracious Ends
The Lord defers to hear our prayer,
For he no hurt intends.
[7]
Genesis 18.19.
Our Prayers are sometimes heard,
Not just unto our mind,
Yet heard they are, and answered
In some far better kind.
2 Cor. 12 8, 9.
God may deny to grant
That thing that we request,
Yet answer in a better thing,
For he knows what is best.
[8]
Be silent then frail Flesh,
Thou savourest not these things:
Thy wisdom does but vex my Soul;
Leave off thy Reasonings.
Genesis 3.
Satan by Serpents mouth
Mankind did undermine:
And I perceive he now assayes
To ruin me by thine.

SONG VI.
Another Combat between the Flesh and Spirit.
Flesh. [1]
SOul thou have cause to fear
Thy Faith will not hold out:
And that it is but counterfeit
Thou do so often doubt.
See what a mighty power
Of Unbelief prevails
From time to time! and how thine heart
And Faith thee often fails!

Spirit. [2]
Oh sly and sinful Flesh!
Thou art a treacherous Thief,
That robs me of my Faith, and then
Condemns for Unbelief.
They Are thy suggestions vile
(That do with Hell comply)
That make me doubt, who otherwise
On Christ alone rely.
[3]
John 1.12* Acts 8.37 1 Cor. 1.30* Phil. 3.9* 10. Heb. 12.14.
Whole Christ with all my heart
I earnestly embrace;
And for my whole Salvation I
Rely upon his grace:
Renouncing all my own
Both Righteousness, and Sin*
Endeav'ring Holiness, as well
As Happiness, to win.
[4]
And blessed be the Lord,
Phil. 1.6.
Who will complete my Faith,
Weak though it be, as he the same
At first begotten has:
1 Pet. 1.5. Mat. 16.18.
Mean while he it supports;
And as himself does tell,
It never shall be vanquished
By all the force of Hell.

SONG VII.
Satanical injections foul
Shall not undo the godly Soul
That them bewails, resists and h^tes,
Nor need such question their estates.
[1]
I May not here neglect
Another case to mind,
Wherewith some precious Souls to be
Full sore agriev'd I find:
A case calamitous,
Beyond the help of man;
For out of Satan's deadly gripe
Christ only rescue can.
[2]
Blasphemous, hellish thoughts
Into his mind are cast
Concerning God; which make him quake,
And stand like one aghast.
Imaginations black,
And Fancies filthy-foul
Are darted in with violence,
Which stab him to the Soul.
[3]
Which way soever he turns
His Understanding's ey,
Think what he will, these fancies vi^e
Do meet him presently.
Poor Soul he them resists
And struggleth as for life:
But yet he cannot keep them out
By all his care and strife.
[4]
The more he with them strives,
The more they wound and vex him*
The more he dreads and fears them,
The worse they do perplex him.
And when he meditates
Or prays to God for grace,
Then most of all such horrid thoughts
Do stare him in the face.
[5]
This makes him dread to pray,
Or read, or meditate,
Because such thoughts mix with his prayers
As God, he knows, does hate.
For all these Blasphemies
And thoughts that Hell suggests,
He judges them his own hearts sins,
Although he them detests.
[6]
Experience daily shows
It may befall a Saint
To be thus dogged with Hell's black Hounds
Until he almost faint.
And barely this to know,
That ever any were
Thus exercised that feared God,
May mitigate thy fear. Lam. 2.13*

[7]
It yields us some support
To know we are not alone,
But that through such a dismal way
Some have before us gone.
But for to come more near,
And speak unto thy grief
What in a few lines may be spoke,
The answer is in brief;
[8]
Such thoughts how vile soever
And full of Blasphemy,
They are no further our own sins Romans 7.1^, 20.

Then we with them comply.
They are the Devils sins,
And his suggestions foul,
Not thine who mournest under them
And ha^'st them with thy Soul.
[9]
Be not discouraged;
God will not them impute
To thee, but unto him who do'th
Those poisoned Arrows shoot.
But, oh thou will complain,
Romans 7.23, 24.
My heart is tinder-like
As prone and ready to take fire,
As Satan is to strike.
[10]
Well, let it humble thee
To feel a treacherous part
A sinful Self; a wicked Flesh
Remaining in thy heart.
Yet for thy comfort know,
Thou have not lost the field,
So long as thou do sin resist,
And strivest not to yield.
[11]
Are wicked thoughts thy load
Psa. 119.113.
And heavy burden still,
From which thou longest to be freed
Romans 7.17, 23, 24, 25*
As from the greatest ill?
The Lord is nearer thee
Then thou art well aware:
He keeps thee that thou art not caught
Psalm. 91.3
By Satan's deadly snare.
[12]
Yea though Temptations strong
May thee sometimes surprise;
If by Repentance from thy falls* Psa* 32.^.

God helps thee to arise:
Fear not, all turns to gain;
For Gold is purified,
And loses nothing, but its dross,
By being often tried.
[13]
Christ has the Devil fast, Luke 1^.3^.

And holds him in a Chain,
And that he may not swallow thee
He does him still restrain.
He can no longer vex thee Romans 1^ 2^.

Then Christ shall him permit
Who will in season take him off,
When he shall see most fit,
SONG VIII.
[1]
ANd now for such as feel
These hellish Buffettings,
And anguish of these sudden darts,
Which are the Serpents stings;
I shall a word or two
Of Counsel here annex:
God make them useful unto -- some
Whom Satan does perplex.
[2]
Exodus 20.9. Eccles 4.9, 10, 11, 12 Matthew. 6.6.
Follow thy Calling close.
Love not to be alone;
Save only when by secret Prayer
Thou makes to God thy moan.
Omit not secret Prayer,
Nor other Means neglect:
The Tempter has thee where he would,
If once he that effect.
[3]
Thy help is in the Lord; Hos. 13 9. Ezekiel. 36.37.

From him it must be sought:
Use thou the Means, and wait his time,
Who lingers not for naught.
Thy Prayers are poor and vile;
Yet do not them forgo:
For what were that, but for to give
Thy weapon to thy Foe!
[4]
Cry mightily to God 2 Cor. 12.8. Psalm. 56.3

When other Helpers fail:
Rely upon him steadfastly,
When terrors thee assail.
The more the Devil strives
(For this is all his scope)
To rob thee of thy Spiritual Arms, 1 Thessalonians. 5.8. Heb. 10.35.

The faster hold thy hope.
[5]
Bewail the sin that cleaves Rom 7.24, 25.

Unto thine holy things,
And look unto the Blood of Christ 1 John 2.1, 2. Matthew. 8.26

Which acceptance brings.
Be not too much dismayed,
Nor 'stonished with fear:
But unto Christ who is thy strength
Labor to keep more near.
[6]
Mat. 14.30.
Distracting horrid Fear
The Soul of strength deprives,
Draws in these thoughts, and to the Devil
A great advantage gives.
Jam. 5.16.
Adventure not to smother
Temptations in thy breast:
Keep not the Devil's counsel, if
Thou do the same detest.
[7]
Make out for help in time;
2 Cor. ^1.3.
Lest by some subtle wile,
Or hidden craft to thee unknown,
The Serpent thee beguile.
Temptations are like Poison,
Provide an Antidote:
It Is easier mischief to prevent,
Then cure it when it is got.
[8]
Jer. 4.14.
Recall not wicked thoughts
Of them to take a view
(No not to make thee loath them more)
Lest thou this folly rue:
But thrust them out of doors,
Jam. 4.7.
And strongly say them nay;
And if thou can not rid them so,
Flee thou, and run away.
[9]
Be not thou like the Sheep,
That, being in a maze,
In stead of running from the Woolf
Stand still and at him gaze:
Till having one devoured
He comes to worry more,
And then they run, but stand again
Still gazing as before.
[10]
Bemoan thy self to God; Psa. 119.113.

In general them confess:
But if thou think them over again
They will thee more distress.
Let every Christian man Genesis 6.5. Prove. 24.9. Psalm. 81.12.

Unto his thoughts take heed:
For God can whip thee with thy thoughts,
Until he make thee bleed.
[11]
Give not thy mind to think
Of vain or evil things,
As thou desire to escape
These hellish Buffettings.
Thus I have briefly given
My Counsel in this case.
The Lord direct thee what is good
To follow and embrace.
Reader, I give thee here
Two Songs in other Meetre:
I hope they will not make a jarre,
But close up all the sweeter.
SONG IX.
[1]
^sa 30 1.
LOrd from the deeps I cried to thee.
2
My voice Lord do thou hear;
Unto my supplications voice
Let be attent thine ear.
3.
Lord who should stand? if thou O Lord
Should mark iniquity:
4.
But with thee there forgiveness is
That feared thou may be.
[2]
Psa. 65.3.
Works of iniquity prevail
Against me sore do they:
But as for our Transgressions
Thou shall them purge away.
Micah 7.18.
For who is a God like unto thee
Pard'ning iniquity?
And the transgression of his folk
That freely passes by?
[3]
I for the Lord wait, my soul waits; Psalm. 130.5.

And I hope in his Word.
Then morning watchers watch for morn, 6.

My soul more for the Lord.
Let Israel for Jehovah stay, 7.

In waiting hopefully:
Because that with Jehovah there
Is kind benignity.
[4]
I to the Lord from my distress Jonah 2.2.

Did cry, and he gave ear:
Out of Hells belly I did cry,
And he my voice did hear.
Why therefore should I be afraid Psalm 49.5.

In days that evil be?
When as my heels iniquity
About shall compass me.
[5]
My soul, ^ wherefore do thou bow Psalm 42.11.

Thy fell ^own heavily?
And wherefore in me make thou
A stir tumultuously?
Hope thou in God, because I shall
With praise him yet advance:
Who is my God, he also is
Health of my Countenance.
[6]
Isa. 126.3, 4.
Upon the Lord for evermore
See that your selves you stay;
For there is in Jehovah store
Of strength that lasts for ay.
In peace, in peace thou will him keep
Whose mind is staid on thee;
Because that in thy self, O Lord,
His trust repose does he.
[7]
^ai. 50.10.
Though such as truly fear the Lord,
And's Servant's voice obey,
Walk in the dark and have no light:
Themselves yet let them stay
With confidence upon their God,
And in the Lord's Name trust.
11.
But such as walk by their own fire,
Lie down in sorrow must.
SONG X.
A Dialogue or Discourse between the Believing Soul and her Savior.
Soul. OH Christ my grief is such,
Because I love not much;
As adds to my sore,
Because I grieve no more.
Give me a broken heart,
That may both bleed and smart,
That I so often stray,
That I no more obey.
Oh make me love thee dearly,
And trust in thee sincerely:
And help me well to prove
Mine interest in thy Love.
That God Omnipotent
Is freely-well-content
To cancel all my debts,
And all my sins forgets.
O Christ let me be thine*
And be thou wholly mine:
Let me be thine entire;
Be thou mine I desire.

Sav. Ah poor distressed Soul
So sad and sorrowful,
That weakly do believe
And would more strength receive;
Behold at thy request
I Am here full ready pressed
To save and succor thee;
Fear not to come to me. Mat. 14.28, 29.

Thou did mine aid implore,
And now it is at thy door.
Malac. 4.2.
I am thy Surgeon,
Do not thine Healer shun.
Do with thine heart embrace
Joh. 1 12. Mat. 13.44.
Both me and all my grace?
Can me thy Treasure make,
And for thy Portion take?
Psalm. 119.94. Mat. 11.29.
Do thou thy self resign,
And yieldest to be mine?
Would thou as willingly
Be ruled as saved by me?
Joh. 6.37.40.
Then I my self entire
Do yield to thy desire.
Believe and do not doubt
I will not cast thee out.
I am and will be thine;
Ephesians. 1.3, 6, 7.
And all this wealth of mine
Dear purchased by me
I freely give to thee.
Gal. 5.22. Psalm. 130.8.
L^ght, pardon, joy, and peace,
Eternal life, and ease,
With full Redemption,
Shall be thy Portion.
Also my Father mild John 20.17. John 14.16, 17.

Thy Father will be styled:
My Spirit the Comforter
Shall be thy Strengthener.
He shall thy Will renew Ezekiel. 36.26, 27.

And by degrees subdue
Thy Lusts, and all thy foes
That Holiness oppose.
He will to thee impart
An humble broken heart,
Increase of Spiritual strength,
And Victory at length.
Doubt not poor soul; Be strong Psalm. 27.14. John 14.27.

For me that waitest long:
And fear not to believe
That I my peace thee give.
Upon me wholly roll Psalm. 37.3, 4, 5.

The Burden of thy Soul:
Thy self upon me stay,
And then rejoice for ay.

Soul. Is This my Savior's voice
That bids me to rejoice?
To me, vile wretch this word
Directest thou* dear Lord!
Will God be reconciled
To one that is so vil'd?
Will thou thy self bestow
On me so base and low?
Shall I now live for ay
That went so long astray?
Will thou such grace out-stretch
Unto a sinful wretch?
O Gracious Grace indeed!
Shown in a time of need.
O God of Grace, All Grace!
How pleasant is thy face!
Psalm. 116.1, 2, 12.
To God what shall I render?
Who me vouchsafes to tender
In this my low estate,
Which was so desolate.
Had I a thousand hands
To do what he commands;
Ten thousand Hearts to love him,
To fear him, and improve him,
As many Lives t'expose
And for his sake to lose:
Yet could I never do him
The service that I ow him.
Thy Love does all surmount, Ephesians. 3.18, 19.

And is beyond account:
I never can express
Sufficient thankfulness.
Yet help me to endeavor 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Psalm. 73.25.

To honor thee for ever;
Thee only to desire,
Love, Reverence, and Admire:
Thee let me ever serve,
And never from thee swerve:
Let this sweet face of thine
Upon me always shine.
Let no sin interpose
To hide, or make me lose
Thy Countenances light,
Which on me shines so bright.

Sick men's Health.
FOr Sick men to be well,
For those that are in pain
To find some ease, recover strength,
And to wax whole again
(By Means or else without)
This is no Novelty:
But to be sick and well at once,
This is a Mystery.
And for our Sicknesses
To be a Salve to heal.
Our deadly Sores, a sovereign Balm
For to procure our weal;
This is a Paradox,
Hard to be understood:
But these discourses following*
Explain, and make it good.
I shall not intermeddle
With the Physicians Art:
Nor Medicines prescribe, which may
Relieve thy Body's smart.
But what may help thee bear
Thine outward Misery
With Patience, as becomes a Saint,
And to get good thereby.
Meditation I.
[1]
OF all Afflictions that
The outward man oppress,
None are more grievous to endure Job 2.4, 5.

Then Pains and Sicknesses;
Especially if great,
And long continuing:
Oh what vexation to the Flesh,
And Anguish do they bring:
[2]
Yet may such anguish great
Befall a child of God:
Not from an Enemie's wrath, but from
His gentle Father's Rod.
God chasteneth his in love Heb. 12.6, 7.

Even when he seems severe,
Exempting not from smarting stripes
Those whom he counts most dear.
[3]
Job 2.7, 8.
Most Patient holy Job
Was broken out all over
With painful boils from head to foot
Loathsome, and grievous sore.
What strange Extremities
Befell this precious Saint
Chap. 2.12, 13.
His Friends astonishment declares,
So does his own complaint.
[4]
His Visage was so marred
Familiars knew him not.
Job 30.17, 18, ^7, 30.
His stiffened Garment girt him like
The Collar of his Coat
With running of his Sores:
His bowels boiled within:
His bones were burnt with fervent heat
Chap. 19.20.
And clave unto his skin.
[5]
His bones were pierced with pain;
His sinews took no rest:
Besides the many other woes
Wherewith he was oppressed.
He could attain no ease
Nor respite, not a little;
Chap. 7.19.
No not so long as till he might
Have swallowed down his Spittle.
[6]
Religious Hezekiah Isai. 28.1, 12.

Whose Zeal for God excelled,
(In whose defense the Lord of Hosts
Had Proud Sennacherib quelled)
With Sickness great and sore
Was sharply visited,
And in the midst of his days
Was numbered with the dead.
[7]
He pours out complaints Verse. 3, 14.

And cries to God above.
He like a Swallow chattereth
And mourns as a Dove.
But when the Lord him hears,
And does Salvation give,
He then can see, and also say,
That by such things men live. Ver. 16.

[8]
Good Lazarus may be sick, John 11.3, 14.

Though Christ's beloved Friend:
Yea of his Sickness he may die,
And to the grave descend.
Poor Lazarus the Beggar Luke 16.20, 21, 22.

Laid at the Rich man's doors
To beg relief, he may be sick
And also full of sores:
[9]
He may through Sickness die,
Or through distressing want;
And yet be carried unto Heaven
And crowned for a Saint.
So then it is no new thing
The Saints of God to see
Under Diseases, Sickness, Pain,
And sore Extremity.
Meditation II.
[1]
ANd now my Soul, go to,
For thine instruction
Romans 15.4.
What can thou learn, when thou art told
What Saints have undergone?
Soul. I see I have too long
Lam. 2.13.
Me with my self compared,
And by much poreing on my self
Have been too much ensnared.
[2]
I thought my own condition
Sometimes more sad then any:
But now I see I have not felt
One half so much as many.
These Saints forementioned,
It plainly does appear,
Have suffered more in one Months time,
Then I have in a Year.
[3]
Nay when I ponder well
What Job did once endure:
My Pains and mine Infirmities
Are but Flea-bitings sure.
The Lord was just, I know,
In all that them befell:
Both just and gracious toward me
I may account him well.
[4]
He has not punished me Job 1^.6.

So much as I deserve,
That from his just Commandments
So much and often swerve.
And should be still afflict me
Much more then yet he has:
He will not wrong me, Lam. 3.22, 39.
who deserve
His everlasting Wrath.
[5]
And howsoever the Lord
Be pleased with me to deal;
Although he never in this world
Should me release or heal;
Mat. 26.39. Lam. 3.29.
O let my Will submit
To his, that is most just;
Let me not murmr, but abase
My self unto the dust.
[6]
1 Thessalonians. 5.18.
Lord make me thankful too
For all that gentleness
Which in thy Chastenings toward me
Thou daily do express.
For Mercy it is, that I
Who more, much more, transgress,
Then many of God's precious Saints,
Am yet afflicted less.
Meditation III.
[1]
THough Christ were never sick,
Yet sure he under-went
Such piercing bitter pains, Psalm. 22.14, 15, 16.
as were
More then equivalent:
And by his Sufferings
He took away the sting 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.

Of all our Sufferings, Sickness, Pain,
And every evil thing.
[2]
Yea he them sanctified
By virtue of his Blood,
That they might as effectual Means Psa. 23*4. and 119.71 Job 33.19 -- 31. Job
36.8, 9, 10, 11

Promote our Spiritual Good.
For he knew how to make
Trouble the way to Peace,
Sickness the way to soundest Health,
And Pain the way to Ease.
[3]
Some men have Bodies sound,
But Souls most deadly sick:
Blind Eyes, hard He^^ts, stiff Wills
Against all Commands that kick.
3 John ver. 2.
Some men have thriving Souls,
Though Bodies not in health:
And God does make their Bodies Ailes
Promote their Spirit's wealth.
[4]
It Is better to be sick,
And have thy Soul wax whole:
Then in a Body hail and strong
To have a sickly Soul.
For through Soul-sicknesses
Thou do dishonor God:
Who may be honored when thou bears
Submissively his Rod.
[5]
Diseases bodily
May help thee to do well:
But Soul diseases, if not cured,
Will carry thee to Hell.
Our Bodies may sometimes
Need Physic, more then Food:
So may our Souls need Sicknesses
And Pains, to do them good.
[6]
Our Bodies Sicknesses
Are Physic for the Soul,
Corrected by a skilful hand
That can its force control:
Who will so moderate,
And qualify the same,
That it shall do no hurt, but good*
Oh blessed be his Name!
[7]
By these he does prevent
Much hurt that might be got;
Preserves us from Infectious Air
As by an Antidot,
Against Constitution sins
Whereto our Nature bends*
And those whereto our Calling leads,
Hereby he us defends.
[8]
By these he purges out Isa. 1.25. J^b 34.31, 32.

Bad Humors, namely Pride*
Self-love, Impatience, Worldliness,
And many more beside.
By these he does our Wills
Unto his Will subdue:
And makes us Peace, with Holiness, Heb. 12.10* 11.

And heavenly things pursue.
[9]
By these he quickens us
Our duty to attend,
Makes sin more bitter, teaches us
To mind our latter end.
Job 42.5, 6.
By these he rend'reth us
More vile in our own eyes,
And helps us more heartily
His favor for to prize;
[10]
Makes Christ more precious to us
And Earthly things more vain.
Romans 8.23.
By these he does from too much love
Of present things us wean:
Makes us to think of home,
And long for Heavenly Rest,
Whilst here we feel our selves to be
With endless griefs oppressed.
[11]
2 Cor. 4.16, 18.
As the outward man decays
And is consumed away,
The inward man thus gathers strength
And vigor every day.
Who would not Physic take
Such Health for to procure?
And that their souls such gains might make,
A little smart endure?
Meditation IV.
A Dialogue wherein the Speakers are Fear and Faith.
Fear. [1]
BUt what if Sickness bring
Extremity of Pain?
How shall I then have Patience, or
Good thoughts of God maintain?
I know Extremities
Are grievous for to bear:
And, which more grievous is, I shall
Dishonor God, I fear.

Faith. [2]
Dread not Extremities
My Soul, thou need'st not fear it,
But if God please to lay more Pain,
He Will give more strength to bear it.
Such is his Faithfulness Psalm. 37.24. I^a. 63 9.

He will no Burden throw
Upon thy back, but what himself
Will help thee undergo.
[3]
Thy Strength is very small,
Thy Patience that is less;
Thy Foes are strong, the World, the Devil*
And thine own Wickedness.
Thou can but little bear,
As well as little do:
Deuteronomy. 33.27.
But th'Everlasting Arms can bear
Thee, and thy Burden too.
[4]
If those Almighty Arms,
That made the World, infold thee:
No matter what the Pressure be;
Psalm. 55.22.
Doubtless they will uphold thee.
His Spirit helps us bear
Our greatest Miseries,
To. 8.26. (...).
And takes our Burdens heavier end
In our Extremities.
[5]
If that our Pains increase,
And grow upon us sore:
2 Cor. 1.5. 1 Cor. 10 13.1^
He makes our Comforts to abound,
And Spiritual Joys, much more.
For God most faithful is,
That lets not his be tried
Beyond their strength; but them supports,
That they may it abide.
[6]
When left unto our selves, 1 Samuel 25.22. compared with 2 Samuel 16.10, 11.

Small Trials vex us sore:
And greater ones are better born,
When God assists us more.
In lesser straits, God's help
We are less apt to mind:
In greater straits we seek him more,
And more assistance find.
[7]
Hence then Extremities
Which make us for to roll
Upon God's Power and Faithfulness Psalm. 37.5. Psalm. 55.22.

The Burden of our Soul:
Which force us out of Self
And unto Heaven send us;
They do but drive us to our Strength, Deuteronomy. 33.26, 27.

For God will succor lend us.

Fear. [8]
But what if God withhold
His Countenances light
In time of great Extremity,
And leave me in the night?
If God forsake me then,
Alas, my Faith will fail:
And Satan watching for a prey,
Will over me prevail.

Faith. [9]
His countenances light
If God from us withdraw,
In Sickness, and with fear of wrath
Be pleased us to aw^
1 Pet. 1.6 Isai. 54.7, 8.
It Is but if there be need*
And it is but for a while;
When the end is once attained, his frown
Is turned to a smile.
[10]
Jer. 33.20, 26.
The Sun can sooner cease
To shine out of the sky:
Then Christ can cease to favor thee,
That do on him rely.
Romans 8.35, 37, 38, 39.
This Earth, that stands so firm,
Shall from her Center move:
Sooner then God Unchangeable
Will take away his Love.
[11]
Nay he will thee support
And strengthen with his Grace:
And while the one hand thee corrects
Cant. 2.6. Heb. 13.5.
The other will embrace.
He will not thee forsake,
Nor leave thee in the mire:
Yea he will bring thy Soul like Gold
Job 23.10.
More bright out of the Fire.
[12]
Soul, wherefore should thou then
Dread Sicknesses, or Pain?
Which in the upshot hurt no Saint, Romans 8.28.

But always turn to gain.
Lord, help me to rejoice
When I am chastened,
That thou art now conforming me 29.

To Christ my blessed Head.
Whosoever is wise, Hos. 14.9.
and does
These things consider well,
Shall know God's ways to be most right,
And forth his praises tell.

Strength in Weakness.
THat weak ones may grow strong
We very often see:
But Strength in Weakness to behold,
This is a Noveltie.
To see a Weak man Strong,
And Strongest when most Weak;
To see the Strong through Weakness fall
And all their bones to break:
This is a Mystery
A Christian Paradox;
But this ensuing little Key
The Cabinet unlocks.
SONG I.
[1]
MAn's Strength mere Weakness is,
As frail as Venice glass:
Isa. 40.6, 7.
And all his Excellency like
The flower upon the grass.
Adam in Paradise,
And in his perfect state,
Genesis 3 6.
When left of God unto himself*
Could soon degenerate
[2]
He that was strong at first
Immediately grew weak:
And let the stock of Grace run out,
Like vessels that do leak.
Hence we are all made weak, Romans 5.6, 12, 14.

And neither have Free Will
To choose, nor Power to do what is good,
But only what is ill.
[3]
But God, the God of Grace,
His Blessed Son employed
And sent to ransom and restore John 3.17.

What Adam had destroyed.
He having us Redeemed
And Ransomed with his Blood*
And also purchased for us Rev. 1.5, 6.

All grace and saving good.
[4]
Restores us to life, Ephesians. 2.5, 6, 1^.

Creates us anew,
Enableth us to do what is good
And evil to eschew*
But still he keeps the Stock John 15*4, 5.

Of grace in his own hand,
And has not left it unto us
To be at our command.
[5]
Phil. 4.13.
The strongest Saints have need
Of daily fresh supplies:
And Christ will teach them where their strength
And all their power lies.
Unless the Sun do shine,
Soon vanishes the Beam:
Unless the Fountain feed it still,
Soon dried up is the Stream.
[6]
Hence if the strongest Saints
Begin to grow secure,
Neglect their watch, trust in themselves;
Christ will not this endure.
He leaves them to themselves,
And lets them try their strength:
They fall and feel their weaknesses
Unto their cost at length.
[7]
2 Samuel 11.2, 3, 4.
Thus David sadly fell:
And who more strong then David?
Or who more graciously himself
In all his straits behaved?
David, while weak, was strong,
And kept his ^ands most pure:
But in his strength he grew most weak
By being too s^^ure.
[8]
Peter was confident Luke 22.33 and 56, 57, 58, 60.

And thought he had much strength
To follow Christ through thick and thin:
But what came on it at length?
He thought his Love so great,
He could with Christ have died:
But ah frail man! e're morning light
He Christ three times denied.
[9]
Some happily here will say;
If Saints of such renown Obi.

Have been so foiled, and to the ground
In time of Trial thrown;
What will become of me,
That am so weak and frail?
How shall I stand, when violent
Temptations me assail?
[10]
Though God sometimes permit Sol.

The strongest Saints to fall,
To stain the glory of all Flesh,
And to awaken all:
Yet let not weak ones faint,
Nor be discouraged,
Who feel their wants and weaknesses,
And flee to Christ their Head.
[11]
Isa. 40.29, 30.
For Christ has strength enough:
Do thou on him depend,
And he will make thee stand in storms,
And hold out to the end.
For in our weakness great
Christ's strength does more appear:
We never are so safe, as when
We get to him most near.
[12]
When sense of our own wants,
And manifold defects,
Drives us to Christ our only strength:
Then he the weak protects.
Hence we are never stronger,
Then when we are most weak:
Because we then most heartily
Christ's help and succor seek.
[13]
2 Cor. 12.5, 7, 9, 10, 11.
Thus Paul that great Apostle,
When I am weak, says he,
Then am I strong; Because the strength
Of Christ then rests on me.
Therefore I rather choose
In weaknesses to glory,
Then of my Revelations great
To tell an ample story.
SONG II.
[1]
ANd now for want of strength
And weakness Bodily,
I could say much; For few, I think*
Have felt it more then I.
I have been many years
So impotent and weak
As none are able to conceive
That only hear me speak.
[2]
And when I find most strength
And thereupon assay
To serve the Lord with all my heart
In the most public way;
Just when I should set forth
Such feebleness assails me
That I am like a man half dead,
All strength and vigor fails me.
[3]
I go to God and tell him,
Thou Lord have strength, I want it
To do thee service therewithal,
In faithfulness O grant it.
Thou putt'st me now on service,
And strength in me there is none:
Therefore on thee the God of strength
I will depend alone.
[4]
Mine eyes are wholly thus
Unto the God of strength:
I cast my self upon his Power,
Who succors me at length,
And in the time of need
Does such assistance give,
That those who hear me scarce know how
My weakness to believe.
[5]
But this is certain truth,
My strength again is gone,
And languishings return, as soon
As e're the work is done.
And every such attempt,
In this my weak estate,
My bodily Ails for diverse weeks
Does much exasperate.
[6]
By every little doing
I suffer very much:
Yet at God's hand I neither dare,
Nor have I cause to grutch*
Has not the Potter power
To frame out of the clay
One vessel for to serve him thus*
Others another way?
[7]
But I have said enough,
All tending to depress
The Creature, and for to advance
God's Power and Faithfulness*
For sure his Power shines forth 2 Cor. 12.9. Jer. 9.23, 24. 1 Cor. 1.31.

In our Infirmity;
That whosoever glories, glory may
In God alone most High.
SONG III.
A Dialogue wherein the Speakers are Troubled Conscience and Rectified
Judgment.
Troub. Consc. [1]
OH, but my weakness brings
Unserviceableness,
And takes me off from Christ's sweet work*
Who can this grief express?
When as the Body fails
The Soul, and hinders it
In all its motions, like a clog;
I am for nothing fit.

Rect. judgm. [2]
If Christ disable thee
From doing as before,
He calls thee to some other work
That he approves more.
Passive Obedience
More hard then Active is:
And Christ will own and honor that,
Who owns and crowns this.
[3]
Thou still art serving Christ* 1 Pet. 4.12, 13, 14.

Though in another way:
And he thy Service will accept
And crown another day.
Thy Suffering is his work, Col^ss. 1.24.

As well as Doing was:
Thy service in a suffering way
Christ rather chosen has.
[4]
If Christ has called thee off, 1 Kings 17.1, 3, 4.5.

After a short assay,
From Public Service; cease dispute,
And cheerfully obey.
Masters are pleased best,
When as their will is done,
Although a nobler work be left
To do a meaner one.
[5]
If he be pleased to make it
Thy business to sit still:
Thou please him the best, by meek
Submission to his Will.
God has no need of us,
Nor any work of our:
Yet for the deed he takes our will,
Where he denies power.
[6]
Although the work be small
Thou can for him effect:
2 Cor. 8.12.
Yet if there be a willing mind
He does the same accept.
For not by the outward bulk
Of what we do fulfill,
God does esteem our services;
But by the Doers will.
[7]
For this he will reward thee
As richly at the last:
As if thou able were to do
More work then e're thou wast.
Thou have a gentle Master,
That sets no cruel task:
But when he deitly abate thy strength
He does less service ask.
[8]
Do what thou can, my Soul
For God no more expects:
Luke 12.48.
Where much he gaves, he looks for much;
Where less, hevless accepts.
But make not this a cloak,
Vile Flesh, for Slothfulness:
Deuteronomy. 10.2^.
God will be ser^'d with all our might,
Be 't more, or be it less.
^^^^ [5]
He was a Rich Poor man,
Whose Poverty prepared him
For Heaven: But he a poor Rich man
Whose Worldly Wealth ensnared him.
That man is Poor indeed
Both when he lives and dies,
That has some Treasure here on Earth,
But none above the skies.
[6]
He that enlarged his Barns Luke 18, 20.

To treasure up his store,
Was fetched away to Hell that night,
And died worse then poor.
And so is every man,
That being worldly-wise
Provides for the outward man, but does
The Heavenly wealth despise.
[7]
All Poor men are not Rich
('Twere happy if they were)
But such as Christ enriched has,
And unto God brought near.
All Rich men are not Poor
(That were a woeful case)
But such as have no part in Christ,
Nor any saving grace.
[8]
Let not the poorest Saint
Despond; for thou art rich:
Nor richest Worldling bless himself*
For thou may be a wretch*
Mat. ^.33. Luke 16.9 Luke 12.33.
But let both Rich and Poor
Endeavor to make sure
Of Heavenly Treasure, Spiritual Wealth*
This only will ensure.
[9]
If others will be fools
And no true wisdom learn:
Yet what belongs unto my peace,
Lord, help me to discern.
Psalm. 17.14.
To have my Portion here
Oh let me never choose:
Nor for the sake of trifling Toys
Eternal Joys refuse.
[10]
My Soul craves better things
Then this World can afford:
Psalm. 73.25, 26.
Thou art the Portion that I choose,
Give me thy self, O Lord.
I shall be richer then,
Then if I were possessed
Of all the Riches, that are found
Both in the East and West.

Meditation II.
[1]
THe World does value men
According to their Wealth,
Without enquiring how it is got,
By Honesty, or Stealth.
What such a man is worth
They commonly declare
By telling what his yearly Rent
Or his Possessions are.
[2]
But God does more esteem
Men's Virtues then Estates;
And if they have small Grace, or none*
Accordingly them rates.
When he Belshazzar weighed
With Babel at his back, ^

Although he were an Emperor
He found him weight to lack.
[3]
I Will not envy the Rich,
Nor will I slight the Poor:
But what God prizeth more then wealth*
That I will value more.
For Poor men may be rich,
And Rich men may be poor;
If those have Heavenly wealth, and these
Have none but Earthly store.
[4]
Prove. 11.^
For Riches profit not
When as the day of Wrath
Is come; But Gospel-Righteousness
Delivers from Death.
Prove. 12.26.
The Upright man is better,
(Though in a Sheep-skin clad
And fed with Indian Bread and Water)
Then those whom Wealth makes mad.
[5]
Though Riches in the World
Jam. 2.2, 3.
Do make men honorable;
Though Poverty do bring contempt,
And render despicable:
Yet God oft-times bestows
Mat. 11.25.
True Faith with Saving Grace,
And Heavenly Glory upon those,
Whom men account most base.
[6]
Weak, foolish, mean, obscure, 1 Cor. 1.27, 28.

And such as men despise,
Such are the Persons and the things
Whereon God sets his eyes.
Of such he makes Sons,
Yea more then Sons, Jam. 2.5.
his Heirs
And Fellow-heirs with Christ, that so
The Kingdom may be theirs.
Meditation III.
A Dialogue, the Speakers being, Faith and Unbelief.
Unbelief. [1]
THou speak slightly how
Of all these outward things:
But what, when Poverty thee wounds
With all her Pois'ned Stings?
What if thy Weaknesses
Bring on distressing wants?
How will thou then behave thy self?
Or live without complaints?

Faith. [2]
Perhaps I may not live
Those future Months to see:
And then 'twere folly to take thought
For what shall never be.
But if the Lord see fit
That I on Earth abide
Mat. 6.26 -- 34.
A longer time, he can and will
(...) sustenance provide.
[3]
1 Timothy 6.8.
If I have Meat and Drink,
Though neither of the best,
And Clothes that will but keep me warm,
I shall not be distressed.
Mean things give me content;
For God can mean things bless,
Psalm. 37.16.
More then their overflowing Cups
That greatest things possess.
[4]
Those that abound in wealth
May lose it in a night;
And be despoiled of all they have
Before the morning light:
And if they have no God
To help them in their need;
It matters not what once they were,
They Will then be poor indeed.
[5]
But he that has the Lord Psalm. 23.^.

Engaged by Covenant
To stand his Friend at every turn,
That man can never want,
My Soul be thankful then;
Thou have a better lot, Psalm. 16.5, 6.

Although thy substance be but small,
Then worldly men have got.
[6]
Thou have a gracious God
Who never will forsake thee, Heb. 1 5. Psalm. 7 24.

But here on Earth he will do thee good,
And then to Heaven take thee.
A blessed Portion He
To all that on him trust:
Whose Souls and Bodies he will feed;
But he will not feed their Lust.
[7]
Our Savior teaches us
For daily bread to pray; Mat. 6.11.

Not for a twelve-months Bread at once,
But for each present day:
That so we might on God
From time to time depend,
Believing that our present help
Will help us to the End.
[8]
Of present things, my Soul,
What present need requires
1 Timothy ^.8, 9. Man. 6 25 -- 34.
Thou do possess: here stay thy thoughts
And bridle thy desires.
Beware lest future things
Thy careful mind distract:
For carking care can nothing else
But guiltiness contract.
[9]
Rev. 21.7. Genesis 33.^^ (...)
Good reason has the man
To be content with small things,
Who when he is at lowest ebb,
Yet still possesses all things.
For God is All in all
I have All (...) Jacob (...) 17 To. 11.^6
Through Christ his gracious Son,
The Ocean whence all streams proceed,
And into which they run.
[10]
He is a living Spring,
A Fountain never dry:
Though water in the Pitcher fail,
The Fountain can supply.
That man is not i'th'dark,
Psalm. 84.11.
That still enjoyes the Sun:
Although his Fire be quite gone out,
And Candle ends be done.

Meditation IV.
[1]
O Man of little faith!
Behold the winged Fowls, Mat. 6 26.

The Ravens, Crows, and Cormorants,
The Kites, the Hawks, the Owls,
Also the numerous Doves
Whose flocks make dark the Air*
And tell me who for all this Crew
Does kindly food prepare.
[2]
The Heavenly Father's wise
And wondrous Providence
Gives unto all these Multitudes
Their daily sustenance.
Does God take care of Fowls Psalm. 149.9. Luke 12.24.

And hear the Ravens cry?
And can he see his Saints in want
And not their wants supply?
[3]
Romans 8.32.
He that did not withhold
From death his only Son,
But gave him up, that we through him
Might gain Salvation:
He that has given us
An interest in his Blood,
Will not deny us lesser things
That may promote our good.
[4]
1 Pet. 1.4. Luke 12.32. Mat. 13.43. Mat. 7.9, 10.11.
He that has called us
To his Inheritance,
And unto royal dignity
Intends to advance:
He that will make us shine
In glory like our Head,
Will not put off his Childeren
With stones in stead of Bread.
[5]
For Meat and Drink and Clothes
What need the Child take care
That has a Father Kind and Rich
To tender his welfare?
Isa. 49.15 Psalm. 14^ 5. Psa. ^4.1.
Thy Father is more kind
Then Earthly Fathers be:
Amongst them all there is none so wise
Nor none so rich as He.
[6]
If Kind, he wants not will;
If Rich, he wants not power:
If Wise, he knows what is best to give*
And when is the fittest hour.
He knows what be thy wants Man. 6.32. Isa 65.24.

Before thou them declare:
And often bestows before thou ask
The things that needful are.
[7]
He has thy wants prevented,
Rather then wants supplied:
And not without great cause thy Suit
At other times denied.
He knows what things will most
Unto thy weal conduce:
And when such things as may do good
Will be of greatest use.
[8]
Thou often have tried his love, Luke 22 35.

And found his readiness
To give thee succor and supplies,
Whens'ever in distress.
Let past Experiences 2 Cor. 1.10. Psalm. 34 9.10.

Make thee in him confide:
Who will for all that in him trust
Most seas'nably provide.
[9]
Thou want thankfulness:
This calls for complaint
Against thy self: of other things
Thou have no present want.
Oh get a thankful Heart;
1 Cor. 1.30. Mat. 7.7.8, 11.
Christ can this want supply*
And if thou seek it seriously,
Will not thy suit deny.
Meditation V.
[1]
THis Meditation
Mine Heart has comforted;
Mat 15.26, 27.^^
That he who feeds the Dogs with crumbs,
Will give his Children Bread.
By Bread I mean both that
Which our frail Body feeds,
And also that which does relieve
Our Spiritual wants and needs.
[2]
That Is Bread of Life indeed, John 6 27, 51 55.

Which never does decay:
Which makes those who thereon feed
To live and thrive for ay.
This Bread makes dead men live; John 1^ 25.26.

And lets none living die,
But feeds them to Eternal Life;
This is a Mystery.
[3]
Such Bread Christ Jesus gives,
His own dear Flesh and Blood,
Wherewith he nourishes our Souls*
Oh this is wondrous food!
He that the greater gives
Will not the less deny: Romans 8 32. 1 Timothy 4.^

But when our Bodies stand in need,
He will their wants supply.
[4]
Again, when I behold
What great things God bestows
On Turks and Pagans (Infidels)
And such as live like those.
I certainly conclude
He has some better Treasure
To give his Saints, then Worldly-wealth,
Honor, or Carnal Pleasure.
[5]
For will not God deal better
With Servants, then with Foes?
With Children, then with Enemies
And such as Christ oppose?
Has not Christ purchased
Far better things for Saints,
Then common bounty here affords
To faithless Miscreants?
[6]
The Turkish Empire vast,
What is it? but a Bone
That by the Master of the House
Unto the Dogs is thrown?
The Gold Mines of the West,
And Riches of the East,
Are oftentimes possessed by one
That lives and dies a Beast.
[7]
If God bestow such gifts
On ^^oody brutish men:
Psalm. 31.19. 1 Cor. 2.9.^
Oh what great things has he in store
For his dear Childeren!
No mortal eye has seen,
No Ear did ever hear,
Nor Heart conceive, what Christ prepares
For such as do him fear.
[8]
Earth's Treasures are but dung, Phil 38. Amos 2.7.

And carnal Pleasures base,
Unto those Joys the Saints enjoy
Before Christ's Royal face.
The richest Robes are Rags,
And contemptible geer,
Unto those bright and shining Robes Mark 9.3.

The Saints in Glory wear.
[9]
The stateliest Palaces, 2 Cor. 5.1 -- 9.

If we should them compare
With those Celestial Mansions,
More vile then Hog-sties are.
What now we have in hope,
We shall have in fruition,
When all ungodly men at once
Are drowned in Perdition.
[10]
My Soul, rejoice in God,
Who will enrich thee more
Then those, that of all Earthly wealth
Possess the greatest store.
If thou be Christ's, then He, Cantic. 2.16.

And all he has is thine.
Oh feast thy self with these sweet thoughts,
And with them sup and dine.
In Confinement Liberty.
WHat may this Riddle mean?
Confined, and yet Free!
In Bands, yet Loose! A Prisoner,
And yet at Libertee!
It Is but a Notion sure;
No, No, It Is very True,
And that these Pages following
Will prove and plainly show.
SONG I.
[1]
MOst men love Liberty,
And covet Elbow-room
To have their Wills, to serve their Lusts,
And up and down to rome.
God's Ways they count a Prison,
Romans 8.6, 7, 8.
His Precepts and Commands
A heavy Yoke; his Threatenings
Like Fetters and strong Bands.
[2]
Come let us break their Bands Psalm. 2 3.

And cast their cords from us:
Let Us give the Reins unto our Lusts,
And not be Bridled thus.
This Liberty of theirs John 8.34. Romans 6.16.

The greatest Bondage is:
For he is a Bondslave unto Sin
That loves to do amiss.
[3]
He is a Prisoner Ephesians. 2.2.

Unto his mortal Foe,
Who leads him bound with Cords of sin
Unto Eternal woe.
Such Prisoners may enjoy
External Liberty,
And being under no restraint
They run to Hell more free.
[4]
Ah woeful Liberty!
To such as it abuse;
Which leads them to Captivity,
Who their own Bondage choose. Prove. 1 32. and 5.22.

I rather had be bound
With Fetters made of Brass,
Then to enjoy my Liberty
And be at such a pass.
[5]
Job 36.8, 9, 10.
God binds some in Chains,
And in Afflictions Cords,
And by these Bands, unto their Souls
More Liberty affords.
Who would not be in thrall,
Soul-Liberty to gain,
Rather then Sins and Satan's thrall,
And Captive to remain?
[6]
Manasseh was a slave
To Sin, and never free;
2 Chronicles. 3^.10.11, 12, 13, 15.
Until his Foes had carried him
Into Captivity:
But being bound in Chains,
He calls to mind his sins,
Humbles himself, and to bewail
His former life begins.
[7]
His Prison was a place
Of greatest Liberty:
For from the bondage of his sins
It helped to set him free.
As Liberty abused
Procured his Misery:
So Bonds him humbled and prepared
For blessed Liberty.
[8]
While Jonah's stubborn will Jonah 1.

Did over him prevail
It brought him down into the Deeps
And Belly of the Whale.
That fearful Prison house Chap. 2.

Him to Repentance brought,
And then for Body and for Soul Ver. 10.

The Lord Salvation wrought.
[9]
The Basket of good Figs Jer. 24.^.6, ^*

To Babylon were sent
In mercy, that they might be freed
From sorer punishment.
That being humbled there
Under God's mighty hand,
He might return them back again
Into their Native Land.
[10]
Thus some that are in Bonds
By Bondage, get more free:
Others are ^ett'red with their sins
That walk at libertee.
His own Iniquity Prove. 5.22.

The wicked man shall take:
His sins, like Cords, shall hold him fast,
And Satan's Prisoner make.
SONG II.
[1]
THough Liberty it self
Is greatly to be sought;
And they are happy that know how
To use it as they ought;
Especially whose hearts
Esteem and highly prize
And likewise carefully improve
Their Spiritual Liberties.
[2]
Yet when the Lord is pleased
Such freedom to deny,
He can another Freedom give
Even in Captivity.
When he our Will subdues,
And helps us be content
With his dispose, there is Liberty
Even in Imprisonment.
[3]
Man's unsubdued Will Romans 8.7, 8. Psalm. 119.45, 47. 2 Cor. ^0.5.

Is a most heavy Chain:
That man may walk at Liberty
That can this freedom gain.
When as the Will is brought
Into Captivity
Unto the holy Will of God;
This is sweet Liberty. Psalm. 119.32.

[4]
Let but the Will be broke, Phil. 4.11, 12, 13.

Its Tyranny undone,
And other Bands that us restrain
Will quickly be as none.
For then the Soul applies
It self to get that good
Thereby, which God intends, and Christ
Has purchased with his Blood.
[5]
And God that can bring good Romans 8.28.

Out of the greatest ill,
If that we seek him seriously,
His Promise will fulfill.
He will unfetter us, Job 33.27. and 36.8, 9.10.

And set our Souls more free,
Even by restraining Bands, from sin
And Satan's Tyranny.
[6]
He Will wean us from the world,
And all things here below;
Mar. 19.29. 2 Cor. 4.17, 18.
And better things in stead of these
He will on us bestow.
He Will set our hearts upon
The things that are above:
And give us more and more to taste
The sweetness of his Love.
[7]
He will enlarge our Souls
To run his Precepts way:
2 Cor. 5.14. 1 John 5.3.
The love of Christ shall us restrain
Most gladly to obey.
And his Commandments
They shall delightful be.
Thus he can make Restraint a means
Of greatest Liberty.
[8]
Hos. ^ 6, 7, 14.
God hedges up with thorns
The Path of Wanderers,
That have of Creature Comforts been
Too eager Followers,
Stops their pursuit, them brings
Into a Wilderness,
That thereunto their humbled Souls
He may more Love express.
SONG III.
[1]
THe Saints have never been
To meet with God more free
Then when they have been most deprived
Of outward Libertee.
When Banished, Confined,
Impris'ned they have been:
They have God's Presence more enjoyed,
And more his glory seen.
[2]
When Jacob fled from home
Because of Esau's spite,
And lay abroad i'ch'open Air Genesis 28.11, 12, 13.

Upon the Earth all night:
He saw that wondrous Ladder,
Whose top to Heaven raught,
Which Jesus Christ God-Man, and our
Salvation by him, taught.
[3]
Exodus 3.1.2, 4, to 10.
Moses i'th'Wilderness,
During his Banishment,
Meets with the God of Israel,
And is to Israel sent
To carry welcome news
Of their deliverance,
And that the Lord would lead them forth
To their Inheritance.
[4]
Dan. 6.22. Dan. 3.25. Rev. 1.9, 10, etc.
Daniel in the Lions Den
Had Angels company.
And when those three were in the Fire,
The Son of God stood by.
John in his Patmos-Isle
Most glorious Visions had,
And Revelations of such things
As make God's Sion glad.
[5]
Acts 16.25, 26.
While Paul and Silas sing
Together in the Stocks;
The Lord an Earthquake sends, and all
The Prison-doors unlocks.
Acts 23.11. and 27.24.
Sundry sweet Visions
Had Paul in his Restraint:
The Lord appearing to confirm
And cheer his Suffering Saint.
[6]
The time would fail to tell
Examples of this kind:
These are enough to prove, that Saints
May God in Prison find,
Where God is most enjoyed,
There Is sweetest Liberty:
But many have enjoyed him most
In their Captivity.
[7]
Lord, let me more enjoy
Thy Presence in Restraint:
And then of wanting Liberty
I need not make complaint.
My Soul bring out of Prison, Psalm. 142.7.

That I thy Name may p^a^se:
Oh set my feet at liberty
To walk in Wisdom's ways.
In Solitude Good Company.
TO be alone sometimes
And want no Company
Whilst men are Musing; this you will say
Is no great Rarity.
But when we are alone
To have Good Company,
The best that ever man enjoyed,
This is a Mystery.
How such a thing can be,
Although Religion teach it,
And many can discourse thereof,
Yet Nature cannot reach it.
[1]
MAn's Nature sociable
Delights in Company,
Declines and dreadeth Solitude,
And loves Society.
Hence to be stripped of Friends,
And to be left alone,
Psalm. 102.6, 7.
Must needs be grievous in it self,
A sore Affliction.
[2]
But bitter though it be,
God's Presence can allay
The Bitterness of Solitude,
And take it quite away.
Our Sav^our tells the Twelve,
You all desert me w^ll: John 16.32.

Yet I am not alone, because
The Father's wi^h me still.
[3]
And as he was with Christ
So is he nigh to all
(For Christ his sake) that call on him,
In truth that on him call. Psalm. 145.18.

And he has promised
To be with his always:
And that he never will forsake Josh. 1.5.

Nor leave them all their days.
[4]
That when they p^ss through fire
Or water, he will be there: Isa 43.2.

The fire it shall not burn, nor floods
Them drown, 'cause he is near.
He dwells i'th'burning Bush. Exodus 3.2, 3.

To see the Fire so blaze,
And yet the Bush keep unconsum'd,
Good Moses did amaze.
[5]
Affliction, though a fire,
God's Saints cannot devour;
Because the Lord dwells in the Bush,
And keeps it by his Power.
The Lord is present still,
And makes his abode
With all true Saints; such Company
Has every Child of God.
[6]
John 14.23.
If any man me love
He will my words obey;
My Father loves him: we will come
And with him make our stay.
The holy Spirit of Truth,
That sweetest Comforter,
Ver. 16.
He will for ever dwell with those
That true Believers are.
[7]
Oh glorious Privilege
Of such as God do fear!
Psalm. 27.10.
Though other Friends forsake them, yet
The Lord is always near.
Christ holds them in his hand,
John 10.28, 29.
And none shall pluck them out:
The Father, who is more then all,
Them holds; they need not doubt.
[8]
They dwell in Solitude,
Are in a lonely case,
That have no interest in this God,
Nor comfort from his Grace.
For such poor Souls as these
My heart could even bleed:
For when their Creature Comforts fail,
They Are left alone indeed.
[9]
I can remember still
That dismal Solitude;
The horror of that Lonesomness
(And state of Widowhood)
Wherein my Soul was once,
From God estranged far: Prove. 15.29.

That was a wilderness indeed.
Such only Lonesome are.
[10]
But he is not alone
That has the Trinity,
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
To keep him company.
Such comforters as these Isa. 61.3. Zeph. 3.14, 17.

Can cheer the Desolate:
And make them sing for joy, who sit
In solitary state.
[11]
Psalm. 41.3* Deuteronomy. 33.27.
When such a man is sick,
The Lord will make his Bed:
And when he languisheth, his Arms
Are underneath his head.
And when he sits alone,
The Lord will with him talk:
Or if he wander in the Woods,
His God will with him walk.
[12]
Psalm. 3.5. Psalm. 4 8.
And when he lies down
He may securely sleep:
Because the Lord in his own Arms
Will him most safely keep.
He may repose himself
Psalm. 91.1, 4, 5.
Under The Almighty's shade:
And in the time of danger great
He need not be afraid.
[13]
God watches over him
For good, and not for ill:
When he lies sleeping in his Bed,
The Lord is with him still.
And when he does awake,
Psalm. 139.^^.
He may with God converse,
Make known to him his wants, and all
His hearts desires rehearse.
[14]
Who truly pities him Psalm. 103.13. Psalm. 34.6, 7, 10.

Who can his wants supply,
Support him in, and bring him out
Of all his misery.
Of Christ's redeemed ones
This is the happy case:
To such high Fellowship as this 1 John 1.3.

We are advanced through Grace.
[15]
Speak then all you that read:
Can that man be alone?
That has his God so near, to whom
He may his wants make known.
Had ever any man Psalm. 73.25.

A better Friend then this?
Lord may I but enjoy thee more,
I others less shall miss.
[16]
O turn to me thy face,
And on me mercy show: Psalm. 25.16, 17, 18.

For I am in a lonely case,
Afflicted, poor also.
Mine hearts straits be enlarged
Bring me out of distress:
My pain and my affliction see,
And all my sins release.
SONG II.
[1]
ANd now for such as are
Of dearest Friends bereft,
That in a solitary state
Most desolate are left:
Oh might I speak a word
That might allay your grief,
Instruct you how to bear your Cross,
Or lend you some relief.
[2]
Suppose a Friend had lent thee
A Stock at thy desire,
To make thy best improvement of,
Till he should it require.
Would think thy Fried unkind
For taking of his own,
When as in lending it at all
Great Courtesy was shown?
[3]
Thy Wife, or Child, or Friend,
They were but Blessings lent thee:
They were the Lords both first and last; Psalm. 24.2. Mat. 20.15. Job 1.21.

And does not this content thee?
May not the Lord require,
When he sees fit, his own?
Thou may be thankful unto him
They were no sooner gone.
[4]
Have thou a part in God?
Can him thy Father call? John 20.17.

Assure thy self thou have a Friend
That does surmount them all.
This Friend does still remain, Psalm. ^7.10. and 102.27.

When other Friends are gone:
Therefore thou need not to mourn
As if thou were undone.
[5]
But if thou have not got
Assurance of this Friend:
Acquaint thy self with him in time Job 22.21. Joh. 13.1.

Who lives and loves to the end.
He is a better Friend
Then Father, Mother, Wife,
Or any other dearest Friend
Thou had in all thy life.
[6]
Let but Christ Jesus come,
And dwell within thy Heart:
Isa. 57.15. Psalm. 68.5.
And he will cheer thee wondrously,
And mitigate thy smart.
He will a Father be
Unto the Fatherless,
A Husband to the Widow sad,
A Judge in her distress.
[7]
Rev. 3.2^.
Behold! he stands and knocks;
Haste, open speedily,
And he will come in, and thou shall sup
With him, and he with thee.
Psalm. 24.7, 9.
Lift up your heads ye Gates;
Ye Doors that last for ay
Be ye lift up, that enter in
The King of Glory may.
[8]
That Soul may change her cheer*
And be no longer sorry,
That entertaineth such a g^est,
Even the King of Glory.
Thou can not be alone,
Nor want Society,
When God the Father, Son, and Spirit,
Shall be thy Company.
This following Song was penned
Eight years agone at least:
I hope it may be useful here
As any of the rest.
SONG III.
A Dialogue between the Flesh and Spirit.
Flesh. [1]
LOrd any Cross but this
I Will be content to bear:
But oh I cannot part with one
Whom I esteem so dear.

Sp. Shall mortal man presume Job 4^ 2.

His Maker to instruct?
Or teach Jehovah in what Paths
He shall his Soul conduct?
[2]
Unto the Lofty One Is^. ^7.15.

Becomes it thee to say,
I will not go to Heaven, Lord,
In such a rugged way?

Fl. Alas! what means the Lord
To chasten me so sore?
I thought my load was great enough*
And yet he lays on more.

Spirit. [3]
1 Pet. 1.6.
God does no more inflict
Then he does needful see:
To need more load where was so much
Should greatly humble thee.
Had gentler Means prevai^'d
To make thee turn to God:
Lev. 26.21.
It Is like there would have been no need
Of this more smarting Rod.

Flesh. [4]
What then? am I more vile
Then all the world beside?
That none but I in such a sort,
That none but I am tried.

Sp. Job. 40.4.
'Twere good thou were more vile,
At least in thine own eyes:
Another's faults excuse not thine;
Thy sin for vengeance cries.

Flesh. [5]
But oh my loss is such
As none have had but I.
Did ever any feel the like
To my Calamity?
If every Circumstance
Of mine Affliction
Be weighed well; in such a Path
I think no man has gone.

Spirit. [6]
Thou may be much deceived
To think thy case more sad,
And thine Afflictions heavier
Then ever any had.
What if the way be such
As never foot did tread?
Some must go foremost: why not thou,
As well as others, lead?
[7]
What if through uncouth ways Jer. 2.6, 7.

God make thee long to trace?
If yet at last he bring thee safe
Unto a resting place:
Shall thou not have good cause
His mercy to adore?
And to extol and magnify
His Name for evermore?
[8]
Are not thy sins much more
Then all thy Sufferings? Job 11.6.

And do not thou deserve from God
Ten times more bitter things?
Small reason has the man
To murmr at the Cross,
Whom God might justly punish with (...) ^.22, 3^*

Eternal Pain and Loss.
[9]
Be silent then frail Flesh:
Impatience hold thy tongue,
And murmu^e not against the Lord,
As if he did thee wrong.
Job 34.10, 17.
Justice can do no wrong*
Nor Mercy cruel be:
Wisdom sees this condition
To be the best for thee.
[10]
Love orders all for good;
Romans 8.28. Psa. 41.3. Heb. 13.5.
Power has undertaken
To give thee strength: And Truth has said
Thou shall not be forsaken.
Take courage then, my Soul,
And moderate thy fears:
Rev. 7.17.
For God himself, who causes grief,
Will wipe away thy tears.
[11]
1 Pet. 5.6.
Under his mighty hand
Do thou thy self abase:
Hos. 6.1, 2.
Return to him with all thine heart,
And sue to him for Grace.
Thy Darkness into Light
He speedily will turn,
Isa. 57.15
Who After-mercies has in store
To comfort them that mourn.

Joy in Sorrow.
CAn Joy and Sorrow meet
That are so opposite?
The one so Bitter, the other Sweet?
What, can such Foes unite?
What! meet in one small Heart!
And lovingly agree!
Join hands and strengthen one another*
Doubtless it cannot be.
As Aaron's Serpent-Rod Exodus 7.12.

Rods of th'Inchanters swallowed:
So godly Sorrow eats up,
That Sorrow that is unhallowed.
It worldly Sorrow kills:
But helps Spiritual Joy.
These two will strengthen one another,
And not each other 'stroy.
The deepest godly Sorrow Isa. 61.3.

Spring-Tides of Joy brings in.
The more a Soul can joy in God,
The more he mourns for sin.
This Grief the Channel is
In which Joy loves to run:
And Joy the Channel deeper plows
Then when 'twas first begun.
If any Nicodemus
Say, How can these things be?
As Philip to Nathaniel said,
So I say, Come and see.
SONG I.
[1]
UNto this General Head
We need not much to say,
For all that went before does tend
Our Sorrows to allay.
Yet forasmuch as Grief
From various Causes springs;
Nor is it possible to name
Each thing that Sorrow brings:
[2]
We Will spend a few leaves more
Concerning Grief, the Effect;
That so we may apply a Salve,
And no man's Sore neglect.
If then thou art a Saint
That languishest in Grief:
God has provided Cordials
To yield thy Soul relief.
[3]
Thou must these Cordials know,
And how to take and use them:
Beware thou do not in a Pett
Neglect, much less refuse them.
God would not have us Blocks
That nothing lay to heart:
Nor would he have us mourn like those
In Christ that have no part.
[4]
Perhaps thou have displeased him,
And therefore art in pain:
But Jesus Christ will soon appease him 1 John 7, 9.

If thou return again.
He is thy Father still,
And does not cease to love thee:
Although he scourge thee for thy faults,
Or for thy sins reprove thee.
[5]
Art thou in heaviness
For some great outward loss?
Of choicest Comforts, dearest Friends?
Or for some other Cross?
It Is fit that when God smites Jer. 5 3.

Thou should feel the smart:
But let Afflictions bitterness
Make thee lay sin to heart.
[6]
If this Affliction be
Jer. 2.19.
An evil bitter thing:
Oh what a bitter thing is Sin,
That does Affliction bring?
More evil is the Cause
Then the Effect can be:
Job 11.6.
For God does punish less by far
Then thine iniquity.
[7]
Is it a bitter thing
To be in Heaviness?
What is it then to grieve the Lord,
Amos 2.13. Deuteronomy. 32.6. Lam. 3.33.
And with my sins to press?
To wrong a loving Father?
Provoke a gracious God
(Who takes no pleasure in our smart)
To whip me with his Rod?
[8]
Convert thy Sorrow's stream
Into the Channel right:
Psalm 51.4 2 Cor. 7.9, 10. Jer. 31.18, 19.20.
And chiefly mourn because thou have
Done evil in his sight.
Thus into godly sorrow
Thy worldly sorrow turn,
And God will turn away his wrath
When thus he sees thee mourn.
[9]
As oftentimes we see
In some acute Disease,
To cut a Vein and let him Blood
Will give him present ease:
Right so does godly sorrow,
The bleeding of the Heart,
Assuage the most heart-killing Grief,
And wondrous ease impart.
[10]
Empty bad humors out;
First cool and cleanse the Blood:
And then a Cordial will revive
And do the man more good.
So when thou humbled art, Isa. 5^.15.

And purged from thy sin:
The Lord himself will comfort thee,
And Cordials sweet give in.
[11]
The deeper that the Plough
Of true Repentance goes: Luke 7.47, 50.

The richer Crop of Spiritual Joy
And Holiness there grows.
The greater Spiritual Joy
The Lord to us imparts:
The more again it humbles us, Ezekiel. 36.31.

And breaks our stony hearts.
SONG II.
[1]
HEarken what God does speak
To such as mourn aright,
That under his Afflicting hand
Are broken and contrite.
Blessed are those that mourn;
Matthew. 5.4.
They shall be comforted:
As first in Sorrow, so in Joy
They shall be like their Head.
[2]
Thus says the lofty One,
The Eternal, Holy Lord;
Isa. 57.15, 16.
I dwell in humble contrite Hearts,
That tremble at my Word:
Their Spirits to revive,
And greatly them to cheer;
For I Will not always angry be,
With such as do me fear.
SONG III.
[1]
THis World's the Vale of Tears: Psalm. 23.4.

We must not look to be,
Whilst we are clothed with sinful Flesh,
From griefs and sorrows free.
Here Grief and Joy take turns:
Hereafter Grief shall cease; Isa. 35.10.

And in the room thereof shall come
Eternal Joy and Peace.
[2]
If for a little moment Isa. 54.7, 8.

God seem to frown upon thee:
With Everlasting kindnesses
He will have mercy on thee.
Our time of suffering here
Is but a little while:
And then his frown, that makes thee sad,
Will turn into a smile.
[3]
Thy Tears are like good Seed
Sown in a fruitful Field:
They are not lost, but shall in time
A joyful Harvest yield.
Psalm. 126.5, 6.
Who sow in tears shall reap
In joy: who go and mourn
Bearing choice seed, shall sure with joy
Bringing their sheaves return.
[4]
In midst of Sorrows great
Let this thy Grief allay,
Rev. 7.17.
That God will turn thy tears to joy
And mirth another day.
The more thy Sorrows here
And Sufferings have bin:
The greater joy and Happiness
Hereafter thou shall win.
[5]
It Is better now to mourn
And to rejoice hereafter:
Then for to wail eternally
For sinful mirth and laughter.
Rev. 18.7. 2 Cor. 4.17.
Short sinful Pleasures have
Long-lasting endless pains:
Short and light sufferings have long joys
And everlasting gains.
[6]
Eternal Happiness
Will make amends for all.
While Faith beholds what joy's to come, Verse 18.

It counts all sufferings small.
If drops of Heavenly Pleasure
Be sweet unto thy taste:
How sweet will streams and rivers be, Psalm. 36.8, 9.

Where drink thy fill thou may?
[7]
Thy future joy so great
And Ocean-like shall be:
That thou must enter into it, Mat. 25.21.

It cannot enter thee.
Oh what a joy is that
That Thought cannot conceive! 1 Cor. 2.9.

That mortal Tongue cannot express,
Nor Heart of man believe!
[8]
The greatest present Griefs,
That thee so much annoy,
Will soon be swallowed in that Sea
Of Everlasting joy.
'Twill then a Pleasure be,
To think of what is past:
And greatly add unto thy joy
To mind how sad thou wast.
SONG IV.
Solamen miseris focios habuisse doloris
Christum cum sanctis --
[1]
IT is an ease in Grief
To have Coparteners:
It yields some comfort and relief
TO have Fellow Sufferers.
Especially to have
Such as our case bemoan,
As lay to heart our sorrows, and
Under our burden groan.
[2]
Ephesians. 4.4, 5*6.
The Saints all make one Body,
Have Union with one Head;
Are acted by one Spirit, and
By him are quickened.
Heb. 13.3.
Hence then they cannot choose
But feel each others smart,
Their Burden bear, lament their case,
And in their woes take part,
[3]
They cannot choose but mourn
With such as mourners be:
And be afflicted too with those Romans 12.15. John 11.16.

Whom they afflicted see.
Christ gives them tender hearts,
Therefore they fellow-feel:
They pity, pray for, comfort them,
And seek each others weal.
[4]
This is a Comfort then
To Saints in misery,
To have such sweet Companions
Of their Calamity.
That when they are in sorrow
They sorrow not alone:
But meet with some that heartily
Their Miseries bemoan.
[5]
Oh let it never be
That Saints should Saints infest,
And add unto each others grief,
That are with grief oppressed.
This wisdom from above Jam. ^.15.

Comes not, but from beneath:
And ill becomes those in whom
The Spirit of Love does breath.
[6]
That Spirit of Love and Peace,
Who dwells in all the Saints,
2 Cor. 13.11. Job 6.14. Phil. 2.1, 2, 3*
Unite our hearts, appease our strife,
Cease quarrels and complaints:
Help us to pity more,
And pray for one another,
To strive who shall in love outstrip
And go beyond his Brother.
[7]
This were a blessed strife;
Thus ought we all to strive:
Were this our strife; how would it make
Ephesians. 4.16.
Souls, Towns, and Churches thrive.
As many Shoulders make
A heavy Burden light:
So might our Burdens lightened be,
Were but our Spirits right.
[8]
Well: Friends may pity us
And at our Sorrows grieve;
They cannot always help: But Christ
Can pity and relieve.
This is the main support,
And comfort of the Saints,
That Jesus Christ them pittieth, when
Psalm. 103.13.
They pour out their complaints.
[9]
Friends sometimes stand aloof, Psalm. 38.11.

And Brethren may forget us,
Or strangers be unto our griefs;
The World at naught may set us:
But Jesus Christ regards us Psalm. 136.23. John 14.18.

Even in our low estate;
He minds us well, and leaves us not
Forlorn and desolate.
[10]
Our gracious, Heb. 2.17, 18. Chap. 4.15.
great High Priest
Is such an One as can
From his Experience pity us
With bowels of a Man.
Afflicted been he has Isa. 63 9. (...)

In their Affliction:
And therefore their Affliction was
As if it had been none. (...)

[11]
Though far above all Griefs
In Glory Christ remains:
Yet of the Sorrows of his Saints
A feeling he retains.
He tells our wanderings, Psalm. 5^* 8.

And bottleth all our tears,
Is well acquainted with our griefs,
And writes down our fears.
[12]
He knows thy Sicknesses;
He feels all thy smart:
Thy sufferings are his sufferings,
And reach his tender heart.
And if he know and feel
All that does thee agrieve:
Isa 40*1, 2, 29, 31.
He will with choicest Cordials
Thy fainting Soul relieve.
[13]
Coloss. 1.24.
If these thy Sufferings
He reckon to be his:
He Will shortly put an end thereto,
Joh. 14.3.
And take thy Soul to Bliss.
Christ will not suffer long:
For he is not perfected,
1 Cor. 15.49.
Till all his Members be made like
In Glory to their Head.
SONG V.
[1]
THus far we have applied
Our speech to mournful Saints,
To cheer them under all their Griefs,
And silence their Complaints.
But all men are not Saints
Whom Sorrow does oppress:
Some may be in a heavy case,
Yet far from Holiness.
[2]
Some Hearts are almost broke
With Carnal Sorrows force* H^sea 7.14.

That godly Sorrow never touched
With any true remorse.
What shall we say to these
That may some ease impart?
What Sovereign Medicine shall we use
To mitigate their smart?
[3]
Poor Souls! I pity you,
And do your case bemoan:
But peace to you I may not speak,
For God himself speaks none.
Isa. 57.20, 21.
There is no peace, says God,
To the wicked when distressed:
But they are like the troubled Sea
Which boils and cannot rest.
[4]
Oh that the Lord himself,
Who now does thee chastise,
And makes thee sad, would waken thee
And open thy blind eyes!
That God would help thee grieve
For what should grieve thee most!
Jer. 3.13, ^1.
That thou a wretched sinner art,
That thou thy God have lost.
[5]
Thou have not him to go to
When sorrows thee agrieve:
Lam. 1.16.
The Comforter is far away
That should thy Soul relieve.
Thou have offended God
And grieved him full sore:
Zec. 1.12.10.
And now he grieveth thee, let this
Grieve and ashame him thee more.
[6]
Could thou but lay to heart
Thy sinful woeful state:
It quickly would thine other griefs
Assuage and mitigate.
Oh get thy worldly grief
Turned to godly sorrow.
Mourn for thy sins, and put not off
Repentance till to morrow.
[7]
Oh turn from every sin Hos. 14 2, 3, 4.

To God with all thine heart:
And make thy peace with him through Christ;
In Christ oh get a part. Acts 10.43. Job 33.23, 24, to 30.

If sorrow bring thee home
To God in Christ: believe
It will the happiest grieving be
That ever thou did grieve.
[8]
For God that wounded thee, Hos. 6.1, 2. Isa. 1.16, 17, 18.

Thy Soul will also heal:
And unto thee his gracious love
In Christ he will reveal.
Oh therefore haste to Christ!
That so thou may not mourn
Like unto them that have no hope,
Because they never turn.
Life in Deaths.
WHat Mystery is this
To seek for Life in Death
The great Destroyer of the Sons
Of Adam and of Seth?
Can Death beget sweet Life?
Can such an Honeycomb,
So sweet and precious, come forth
Of Death's devouring Womb?
Yes: Christ has broke the Teeth
And taken away the Sting
Of Cruel Death; that Death is now
Become another thing.
It is a Messenger
Sent for to fetch us home
Unto our Father's Royal House,
Whither all Saints must come.
It is a Bridge, whereby
We pass to Heavenly Rest,
Out of the Sorrows of this world
Wherewith we are oppressed.
But I Will not here detain thee:
Read on, and thou shall see
Both many Deaths in one short Life,
And Life in Deaths to be.
SONG I.
[1]
THis World's a Wilderness
To God's afflicted Saints.
A place of Dangers, Fears, and Foes;
A place of Woes and Wants.
This Life's a very Death,
At least a dying life:
For this is Death in Life, to find
Sin in our Hearts so rife.
[2]
That we not only are
Encompassed with Foes:
But have a treacherous Part within Romans 7.17.

That does with Satan close.
That Is ready to seduce
And lead us into Evil,
And on a sudden to betray
Our Souls unto the Devil.
[3]
We pestered are with sin
So long as here we live:
Which makes us cry, From this vile death
Verse 24.
Who will deliverance give?
Bodies of Sin and Death
We carry to and fro:
And carry must unto our grief,
Whilst we are here below.
[4]
Verse 23.
We find a Law of Sin
Within our Members dwelling;
Which is against God's holy Law
(Chose by our mind) rebelling:
So that we cannot do
The good things that we would;
And oftentimes we do those things
Which leave undone we should.
[5]
For though we mourn for sin.
And watch, and strive and fight:
Yet is our weakness often foiled
By Satan's subtle slight.
This is a heaviness,
A Death unto the Saints,
Romans 7.18, 19.
Whereof the best while here on Earth
Make sorrowful complaints.
[6]
Oh what a glorious thing
In all true Christians eyes
Would full deliverance be from Sin* Verse 24

They would this freedom prize
More then the richest Mines,
Or most resplendent Gems:
They would prefer it far before
Scepters and Diadems.
[7]
It would be richer Gains Psalm. 19.9, 10, 12. Psalm. 119.5, 71, 72.

Then Honor, Pleasure, Wealth:
It would be sweeter to their Souls
Then Liberty or Health.
Yea Temp'rall Life it self
Might not herewith compare,
Which is more worth then all things else
Which most esteemed are.
[8]
Who would not then be willing,
When Christ him calls hence,
To lay aside this sinful Flesh,
Cause of so much offense?
What Saint, that hates sin,
Can love this life so well,
As for the sake thereof to choose
In sinful Flesh to dwell?
SONG II.
[1]
THis then is Life in Death,
Heb. 12.23. 1 John 3.2. Rev. 21.27.
That Death will set us free
From Sin, which is our Spiritual Death,
And greatest Misery.
We shall no more be grieved
With minds that are so vain:
Of Pride, or Sloth, or Worldliness
We shall no more complain.
[2]
1 Cor 13.10, 12.
Our Ignorance shall cease;
So shall our Unbelief:
Our Passions shall no longer be
A cause of daily grief.
Against God's Providence
Our hearts no more shall swell:
Nor these our unsubdued Wills
Against his Will rebel.
[3]
Our Senses shall no longer
Be inlets unto Sin:
Nor shall there be an homebred Thief
To let his Comrades in.
God, whom we here offend
And injure every day
In thought, word, deed, we shall no more
Offend him then for ay.
[4]
During this mortal life
We walk in midst of Snares,
And we are apt to be surpised
And caught at unawares.
Our subtle Enemy Luke 22.31.

Us every hour besets,
Seeks to allure us by his Baits
Into his deadly Nets.
[5]
He like a roaring Lion 1 Pet. 5*8. Genesis 3.1, 2, etc.

Runs hunting for his Prey;
And like a subtle Serpent he
Lies watching night and day:
Lets no advantage slip
Whereby he may annoy us,
Draw us to sin, disturb our peace;
Distress, if not destroy us.
[6]
Death is the Red Sea, which
When once we are got through,
Exodus 14.3, 28, 29.
Pharaoh (the Devil) with his Host
Can us no more pursue.
God will this Sea divide
And make it us enclose,
Like walls, letting us pass through safe*
And then drown all our Foes.
[7]
The Egyptians cannot follow
Unto the other side:
They shall be drowned in the Sea,
O're-whelmed with the Tide*
The Tempter shall no more
A wicked thought suggest:
Nor once entice to any thing
That God and we detest.
[8]
Temptations u^^o sin
(Which vex us ^ere so sore,
Although they do not Master us)
Shall trouble us then no more*
Then shall our joyful Souls
Eternal Praises sing,
For this their full Deliverance,
To that Immortal King.
SONG III.
[1]
Whilst we are here on Earth
We Are dying every day: 1 Cor. 15.31. Mat 6 34.

Each day brings some new woe or grief
Whilst we are clothed with Clay.
We dwell in midst of Deaths
And Death amidst us dwells,
As too too well appears by
These daily doleful Knells.
[2]
Now one dear Friend departs,
E're long another goes:
Whose turn comes next, or mine or thine,
Or whose, God only knows.
Thus we are often constrained
The pains of Death to 'bide: Acts 20.37, 38. 2 Cor. 11 29.

For Death does often wound our heart
Through one or other's side.
[3]
Pains, Losses, Sicknesses,
Temptations, Sorrows, Sin;
All these are daily Deaths, from which
We can no freedom win,
Until we die our last:
One death will end them all,
And set our Souls at liberty.
Which here are held in thrall.
[4]
Romans 8.22, 23.
The Pains of Life together
Amount unto no small pain:
Who would not one Pain more endure
And so get free from all pain?
Job 14.14.
But we must stay God's time,
And wait till he shall call:
And then one Death will set us free
From Pains and Sorrows all.
[5]
Rev. 21.4. 2 Cor. 5.1. Rev. 14.13.
Then once for all we die,
That die we may no more:
But live in Bliss eternally
The face of God before.
Death is of Life the Gate:
It is the Door whereby
We enter shall into a state
Of Immortality.
[6]
This then our Comfort is,
This is our Life in Death;
To know our Soul shall be in Bliss
When Death has stopped our Breath.
And that this Body vile, 1 Cor. 15.43. Phil. 3.21.

That now is laid in dust,
And turned to Earth, within a while
Be raised in Glory must.
[7]
So soon as Death has closed
Our mortal Body's eyes:
Our Soul shall mount with greatest speed Luke 16.22.

Above the Starry Skies
Born upon Angel's wings
Unto that Heavenly Rest;
Where of Eternal Happiness Mat. 25.46.

She shall be full possessed.
[8]
O Death where is thy Sting? 1 Cor. 15.55, 57.

Thy Victory O Grave?
How art thou conquered, and made
Our Servant, yea our Slave!
Thanks be to God, who gives us
Through Christ the Victory:
That we may live to praise his Name
For this Eternally.
Heavenly Crowns FOR Thorny Wreaths.
SONG I.
[1]
WHen Christ was crowned with Thorns,
Mat. 27.29, 30.
And smitten with a Reed
Upon the Thorns, to wound his Head
And for to make him bleed;
The world did little think
This was the King of Glory:
So when we speak of Crowns for Thorns,
They think it is but a story.
[2]
But as our Lord does now
His Crown of Glory wear;
Who for our sake did wear those Thorns
And such Abuse^ ^ear:
So shall The Afflicted Saints
That suffer for his sake
E're long be Crowned like their Head,
And of his Joys partake.
[3]
Those that for doing well,
For keeping Christ's Commands,
For bearing witness to his Truth
Suffer Reproach or Bands, Rev. 7.14, 15, 16, 17.

Or any other Pain
To keep their Conscience pure;
Such of a glorious Recompense
And rich Reward are sure.
[4]
Those that are persecuted
Because of Righteousness,
Are Blessed ones, says Christ, Mat. 5.10, 11, 1^.
for they
Heavens Kingdom shall possess.
And Blessed are ye whom men
Revile and persecute,
To whom for my sake heinous Crimes
They wrongfully impute
[5]
Rejoice and be ye glad
Hereat exceedingly;
Because there is a great Reward
Laid up for you on high.
For thus they persecuted
The Prophets that of old
Reproved their sins, and faithfully
God's Counsel to them told*
[6]
Mark 10.29, 30.
Who Father, Mother, Wife
For love of Christ forsakes;
Or of his Houses* Lands, Estate
For him small reckoning makes:
Shall here an hundred fold
With Persecutions gain;
And in the World that is to come
Eternal Life obtain.
[7]
2 Timothy 2.11, 12.
If in a suffering state
Of Christ we Followers be:
We shall be unto him conformed
In Royal Dignity.
Mat. 19.28.
Those that have stuck to Christ
In Tribulations great,
Shall Reign with Christ, and sit with him
Upon his Judgment Seat.
[8]
But those that suffer pain
Foul Errors to defend,
That for vile Fancies of their own
Dread not their liv^s to spend:
Such do in vain sup^ose
They suffer for Christ's sake.
It Is not the Suffering but the Cause
That does a Martyr make.
SONG II.
[1]
THat Eminent Apostle
And holy Martyr Paul,
That labored more for Jesus Christ,
And suffered more then All,
When as his race was run
And life almost laid down
For Christ: Henceforth, says he, 2 Timothy 4.8.
there is
Laid up for me a Crown,
[2]
Which Christ that Righteous Judge
Shall give to me above:
And unto all, as well as me,
That his Appearing love.
Christ Jesus at that day
Will all Believers own: Mat. 25 34, 35.

And all their faithful Services
And Patient Sufferings crown.
[3]
Not only such as have
For Jesus shed their Blood;
John 8.31, 32. Mat. 11.29.
But all that have embraced the Truth
And firm therein have stood:
All that have meekly born
Christ's Yoke because 'twas his
Shall be rewarded, and shall share
In Everlasting Bliss.
[4]
1 Cor. 15.41.
Although some Stars outshine
The rest in Glory bright:
Yet every Star in the Firmament
Is full of glorious light.
So every vessel then
Shall full of Glory be,
Though some are of a larger size,
Some of a less degree.
[5]
Our Lord will call to mind
The meanest services
That any man with upright heart
Has done for one of his:
Mat. 10.42.
So that a Cup of Water
Tend'red unto a Saint
For love of Christ, shall not reward
Nor acceptance want.
[6]
Much less will Christ forget Heb 6.10 compared with Heb. ^^ 32, 39

Their love and labor sure
That take great pains, and for his sake
Afflictions long endure.
He that will smallest things
So graciously regard,
Will not far greater things neglect
And leave without reward.
[7]
As in his suffering Saints Acts 9.4, 5. 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.

Christ suffers now; so he
In all his glorified Saints
Will glorified be.
Their Sufferings now are his,
Their Glory will be his:
Christ should his Glory lose, if Saints
Should future Glory miss.
[8]
Christ's precious Sufferings, Isa. 53.4, 5, etc. Gal. 3.13, 14. Rev. 1.5, 6.

And whole Obedience,
Have purchased for us this Crown
And glorious Recompense.
He died that we might live,
Wore Thorns that we might reign.
The End of his own Sufferings
Christ, doubtless, will obtain.
[9]
As surely then as He
Reproach and Shame endured,
And by his Sufferings has for us
A glorious Crown procured;
As sure as we him follow
In patient suffering here;
2 Timothy 2.11, 12.
So certainly this glorious Crown
We shall hereafter wear.
SONG III.
[1]
HOw great this Glory is
No mortal tongue can tell:
Isa. 64.4. Romans 5.10, 17, 18. 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.
But that it far exceeds our thoughts
And words we know full well.
It Is that which Christ's own Blood
Has purchased and acquired:
It Is that which God will then bestow
That he may be admired.
[2]
God's ways are not like ours, Isa. 55.8. Ephesians. 1.6, 14. Rev. 5.12.

Nor are his thoughts like our:
For he will glorify his Grace
And magnify his Power,
Yea and his Wisdom too
By glorifying us,
And therefore Christ will make his Saints
Exceeding glorious.
[3]
That Glory must be great
And of surpassing fame
Which God bestows to get himself Isa. 55.13. Romans 9.23.

An Everlasting Name.
They shall be crowned indeed
With Glory at that day,
When as the richness of their Crown
God's Glory must display.
[4]
When every Saint shall be Isa. 62.3.

A Diamond in Christ's Crown:
They must be glorious Saints indeed,
To set forth his Renown.
The Saints shall shine like Suns Dan. 12.3. Mat. 13.4^.

Arrayed with glorious light,
That through their luster Christ's own Beams
May shine more clear and bright.
[5]
O glorious, rich Free Grace!
And Everlasting Love,
That God's own heart unto these thoughts
Before all time did move!
O wondrous Condescension
Ephesians. 3.18, 19.
Of God's most gracious Son!
And matchless Love of Jesus Christ
Beyond comparison!
[6]
Phil. 2.5, 7, 8.
Who for our sake was pleased
Under a mean outside,
Under the Garment of frail Flesh
His Majesty to hide:
Who ware a Crown of Thorns,
Who shed his dearest Blood,
Isa* 53.5.
Who bare his Fathers Wrath for us
To purchase Saving Good,
[7]
That he ^^ght us Redeem
Rev. 5.9, 10. Romans 5.17, 18, 19, etc.
From endless Misery,
And by his Sufferings us advance
To Heavenly Dignity.
He was content to be
Abused, Reproached and Scorned
That we might be advanced, crowned,
And gloriously adorned.
[8]
That such as have deserved
God's vengeance for to bear
Eternally, should Royal Robes
And Crowns of Glory wear!
Saints can you think of this
And not this Grace admire?
And do not you that are no Saints
To share therein desire?
[9]
Which is the better choice?
With Christ in Bliss to dwell, Deu^. 30.19. compare Mark 9.43* 44. with Phil.
1.23.

Or for to roar eternally
Amidst the flames of Hell?
What? are you in a doubt
Which of the twain to choose?
Well, choose to burn, if that be best:
Choose Hell, and Heaven refuse.
[10]
This were a fearful choice.
What then? Will you be wise?
Oh be so; get a part in Christ:
Him love, him seek, him prize. Mat. 11.28, 29.

Receive him with his Cross;
His Yoke with meekness bear:
And then Free Grace will give you Crowns Romans 5.17.

Of Glory for to wear.
SONG IV.
[1]
1 John 3.1, 2.
BEhold what matchless Love
The God of Heaven shows,
To those on whom Eternal Life
And Glory he bestows!
If now God calls them Sons;
How glorious shall they be,
When being made like Christ, they shall
Him in his Glory see?
[2]
Their Body frail and vile,
That Is in Corruption sown,
Shall then be raised up again
In Incorruption.
This Mortal must be clothed
With Immortality:
And then shall Death be swallowed up
In perfect Victory.
[3]
It is at present sown 1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44.

A Body Natural:
But shall arise again e're long
A Body Spiritual.
We now need many helps
Our vigor to maintain,
As Meat, Drink, Sleep: but shall need none
After we rise again.
[4]
It Is now in weakness sown;
But shall be raised in power:
Sown in Dishonor; but shall rise
In Glory at that hour.
It shall be wholly freed
From all Infirmities,
And be most active, hale, and strong
When once it does arise.
[5]
Though subject to Reproach
Whilst living; and when dead
Must needs be carried out of sight, G^n. 23.4. Phil. 3.21.

And quickly buried:
Yet Christ shall raise it up
With Beauty shining bright,
More lovely then the Morning fair,
With Heavenly Glory dight.
[6]
And if the Body show
So beautiful and fair:
How shall the Soul be beautified
And shine beyond compare?
Rev. 21.11, 18, 19. Rev. 19.8*
Adorned with costly Robes,
More precious far then Gold,
Of Christ's unspotted Righteousness
Most lovely to behold.
[7]
When as God's blessed Image
That was defaced by Sin
Is perfectly restored again
And ever dwells therein.
1 John 3.2. 2 Cor. 3.18.
When as it shall behold
God's Glory shining bright,
And be transformed and glorious made
By that most glorious sight.
[8]
When like a Glass it shall
Receive those glorious Rays,
And back again reflect the same
To God's Eternal Praise.
When in the Sea of Bliss
It constantly shall move:
And be for ever ravished with
The sweetness of his Love.
[9]
If Moses face did shine Exodus 34.29, 30.

By being forty days
In The Mount: how shall their faces shine
That dwell with God always?
Moses his Back-parts saw
But they shall see his face:
And to their joy unspeakable
Enjoy the God of Grace.
[10]
Oh happy, happy Souls
That in God's Bosom rest!
That of the Fountain of all Bliss
Already are possessed!
Your Labor's at an end;
Your Seed in Tears was sown:
But now you reap a joyful Crop 2 Timothy 4.7, 8.

And wear a glorious Crown.
[11]
We that are still below
Have much work yet undone;
A War to wage, sharp Thorns to wear, 1 Timothy* 6.12. 1 Cor. 9.24, 25.

A painful Race to run.
Lord help us so to run
As that we may obtain:
That when this life is at an end,
We may in Glory reign.
SONG V.
[1]
Heb. 12.^.
OUr Savior, for the joy
That was before him set,
Endured the Cross, despised the shame,
And paid for all our debt.
And as himself did eye
That future glorious ^state:
So would he have the thoughts thereof
Our Souls to animate.
[2]
To him that has begun,
And will complete our Faith,
We are commanded for to look;
Who thus despised has
The Ignominious shame
For that most glorious joy;
And having suffered, is set down
At God's right hand on high.
[3]
And though some Gospellers
Call this an Hireling Spirit:
Yet more of such a Spirit, Lord,
Grant that we may inherit.
For surely thou did more
Thy Father's Glory prize,
Then these, that at this rich Reward
Would seem to shut their eyes.
[4]
Oh but the love of Christ
Should wholly us constrain
To do all duties, bear the Cross,
And suffer every Pain.
True; Compare Mat. 25.34, 35. with Titus 3.4* 5, 6, 7.
and the love of Christ
In this most strongly moves us,
That he will regard us, and thus reward us
Merely because he loves us.
[5]
If Christ has purchased
A glorious rich Reward
For all his Followers: shall not w^
This Recompense regard?
If he Rewards propound
To whet our diligence:
Is not our over-looking them
The way to Negligence?
[6]
Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.
Unto this Recompense
Moses had such respect;
That all the Glory of the World
He could for this reject:
Esteeming Christ's reproach
More rich then Egypt's Treasures;
Choosing Affliction with Gods Church,
Rather then sinful pleasures.
[7]
2 Pet. 3.14.
Since then we do expect
Such glorious things as these:
How ought we to bestir our selves
So good a God to please?
How should the ways of Christ
Most pleasant to us seem?
How should this make the heaviest Cross
Romans 8.18.
Grow light in our esteem?
[8]
Oh let the thoughts of this
Incorruptible Crown,
Which shall on patient suffering Saints
So frankly be bestow'n,
Heb. 12.1, 2.
Effectually persuade us
For to amend our pace,
And with more cheerfulness and speed
To run our Heavenly Race*
[9]
More readily to do
And willingly to bear
Whatever Christ shall call us to
So long as we are here;
Knowing that all our Pains
Though worthless, poor, 1 Cor. 15*58.
and vile
Shall such a rich reward obtain
Within a little while.
[10]
How many men can wade
Up to the knees in Blood
To win an Earthly Kingdom, which
Can do them little good?
Which brings them naught but sorrow;
Which cannot satisfy*
Which may be lost before to morrow;
And must be, when they die.
[11]
And shall not we take pains 1 Cor. 9.24, 25.

To win a Heavenly Crown;
Which having once, through grace, obtained
Shall ever be our own?
A glorious, ma^^ie Crown,
A rich Inheritance, 1 Pet. 1.4, to 10.

That Is undefiled, that never fades,
Not subject unto chance.
[12]
Good Lord increase our Faith:
And help us to believe,
That thou will such a rich Reward
To all thy Servants give.
2 Cor. 5.14, 15.
And let this love constrain us
To give our selves to thee:
Thou have us bought and thine we are
Thine let us ever be.
[13]
Now unto him that loved us
Rev. 1.5, 6.
And washed us from our sins
With his own Blood, and made us Priest
To God, and also Kings*
That we might live and reign
Chap. 22.5.
