The Great Mystery of Fox-Craft DISCOVERED. AND THE QUAKER Plainness and
Sincerity DEMONSTRATED,

First, In their great Apostle George Fox; 2dly, In their late Subscribing the
Oath or Act of Abjuration.
Introduced with two Letter written by G. FOX to Coll. Lewis Morris, deceased,
exactly Spelled and Pointed as in the Originals, which are now to be seen in
the Library at Burlington in New Jersey, and will be proved (by the likeness of
the Hand, etc.) to be the Handwriting of the Quakers Learned FOX, if denied.

To Which is Added, A Postscript, with some Remarks on the Quaker-Almanack for
this Year 1705.

THe Originals of these two Letters under Fox's Fist, are now in my hands; I
have shown them to several Persons that knew both him and his Learning, who
have owned them to be his own. Witness my Hand,

John Talbot, Missionary.

Friendly Reader,
We have had G. Fox's Will several times printed, (both in England and here in
America) as it lies to be seen in the Prerogative Office in London, wherein
there is scarce two Lines good Sense or English; and these two Letters are a
Confirmation of his Learning; for by the first, we see, he could not write the
date of the Year or spell his own Name right; how then was he capable to write
a Book, notwithstanding the many Books the Quakers have so impudently published
in his Name, especially his Journal, craftily dressed up by their chief Wits,
that People in after Times might not suspect the Quakers great Apostle to be
such a Buzard as he was. But this is Quaker Plainness and Sincerity.

His Book, called, A Primmer for all the Doctors and Scholars, etc. of 2434
Queries, wherein he is set up as Head and Tutor to all Europe, that the World
might think him to be a Learned Person: This also is Quaker Plainness and
Sincerity.

Likewise, his Book called, A Battledoor, of the Interpretation of 20 or 30
Languages, when he understood not one of them, by which the poor deluded
Quakers were made to believe that G. Fox had the Gift of Tongues by
Inspiration, as the Apostles had at Penticost. But this is proved a Cheat; for
it is discovered that the Quakers hired certain learned Men to do it for them:
They gave one Jew Thirty Pounds to do the greatest part of it, and G. Fox only
put his Name to it, as the Author, to deceive. This is also Quaker Sincerity.
Yet the present Followers of the Quakers will not believe this; so strong is
the Spirit of Delusion, when once it has seized the Soul.

Yet by the Mercy of God, some who have not shut their Eyes so hard, have
discovered the Quakers, especially by seeing what a wicked course this Fox took
to answer his Opponents Books, viz. by picking 10, 12 or 14 words out of a
Sentence of 20 or 30 words, and transposing them, and placing them so as to
turn their sound and Christian Sayings into Heresy and Nonsense, and then
answer them as their Sayings. Nay, sometimes he would charge his Opponent with
the Qrs. Heresy or Error he was writing against. And the Qrs. knowing their
own Guiltiness in this case, would hide it by charging their Opposers with the
same base Method of answering their Books. But this they charge without Proof,
only to amuse. I say, some seeing these ways of Fox, are convinced that he was
an Instrument of Satan, and not of God, and showed them by what Power and
Spirit he took upon him to throw aside Christ's Ordinances, and instead thereof
set up his Womanish Inventions of Female Prelates, and his honorable Courts of
Women, etc.

And indeed, his Denial of the Ordinances of BAPTISM and the SUPPER of our
LORD, and counting them as Humane Inventions, Carnal and Devilish, is alone
sufficient to prove to all who are not bewitched with the same Spirit, that he
was a Minister of Antichrist. And because all Christians from the Apostles to
his Time had continued in the Practice of these Ordinances, he had no way to
confirm his Followers in a Belief that he had Power to put an end to them, but
by declaring himself to be EQUAL WITH GOD, and set up for a Worker of Miracles,
by the same Authority as Christ did; for you shall find in his Journal, in the
third Table, his vile and senseless Miracles are said to be done by the Power of
God, Not in the Name of JESUS, as the Apostles wrought Miracles, but in his own
Name, by the Power of God, To whom, (he blasphemously said) He was Equal, as
his Books testify. And upon this account the Quakers Idolize their great
Apostle FOX, and his Inventions set up instead of Christ's Ordinances, as the
Turks Idolize their Prophet Mahomet's And were the Quakers but in Power, and
half so Numerous as the Mahometans, we should soon see they would as little
bear to hear their FOX spoken against, as they their Mahomet. And unless, it
please God to contiue Watchmen upon the Walls, etc. this Delusion may prove as
dangerous as that of Mahomet, because it carries with it a Pretense of
Christianity, under the Guise of an outside Righteousness; Ministers of Satan
(says St. Paul) Transforming themselves as Ministers of Righteousness, whose
End shall be according to their Works, 2 Cor. 11.15.

And to speak it with Commisseration; Have we not seen this to be the Self
Righteous end of the Quakers? for never any right Quaker has been known to dye
with a Lord have mercy upon him in his Mouth!

For their Foundation Principle being the same with the Heathen Deists, as they
Live, so they dye in the Mode most in voge among the Deists, viz. Hard without
any sense of Christ or of revealed Religion, trusting only to what is within
them, the which, one calls Light, the other Reason, and in which both Quakers
and Deists do magnify themselves.

Now because W. Penn extols this Fox in the Preface to his Journal, for his
wonderful depth in Divinity and his extraordinary Gift in opening Scripture,
and would go to the Marrow of things. Therefore take two or three proofs as
follow.

First, In his Book of Distinction between the Two Suppers, p. 21. he quotes 2 Timothy 17.18. But Hymen^us and Philetus [says he] concerning the truth erred, who
said the Resurrection was past already, such overthrew People from the Faith
that stands in Christ, who is the Resurrection and the Life, through which
Faith they attained to the Resurrection, and had their vile Bodies changed, and
made like unto his Glorious Body.

Note, How he preverts the Scripture both in words and sense, to defend their
Heresy, denying the Resurrection of the Body after Death; for the words of
Scripture, Who shall (...) our vile Bodies, Respect the time to come at the
Resurrection of the dead, but Fox will have it that they have Already attained
the Resurrection, and had their vile bodies changed. Also, he makes the
Resurrection that Paul Preached, Acts 17.19, 22. and 23.6. to be Christ
himself, perverting our Saviors words, who called himself the Resurrection and
the Life, (...) litteral sense, which is plain [to all intelligent persons]
contains a figurative sense, to wit, the Author and Cause of the Resurrection;
As when God is called in Scripture the Saints Hope, Confidence and Salvation,
i. e. the Author and Cause of their Hope, Confidence and Salvation.

Again, In his Book, called, Truths Defense p. 49, 50. in answer to his
opponent, he quotes 1 Pet. 3.29. and says, The Ministers of God they spoke to
the Spirits in Prison, and the Prisoner shall come out of Prison. The Son of
Perdition is above all that is called God in thee -- Thou art one that keeps
the Light in Prison in thee. [And in answer to the Question, Whether the Devil
is stronger then Christ, the Flesh than the Spirit; or, Whether do thou find
he was ever a Prisoner in Satan's Chains? Fox answers, We witness he was in
Satan's Chains, and is in thee, else how could they crucify him afresh?

Note, At what a senseless rate he here perverts the Scripture, and all to prove
his Blasphemy, viz. to prove that God is imprisoned, and in Bondage in Wicked
Men, bound in Satan's Chains in men: For the Spirits in Prison, whereof Peter
writes in that place, were sometimes disobedient in the days of Noah, as the
following words expressly declare. But how could Christ in them be disobedient,
and not only Spirits, but disobedient Spirits? Are not these Rare instances of
Fox his wonderful Depth and extraordinary Gift of Opening Scripture, and going
to the Marrow of things, as W. Penn by his wit has there Romanced? I could give
many the like Instances to prove that his understanding in Divinity was equal
to that of his Schollarship aforesaid.

But to be short; I shall leave his Books, which have all passed through the
Index ex Purgitor^es of the Quakers, before they were published, and will
conclude with a passage taken from his Mouth, which is a more perfect Proof of
his Parts and Learning, being a short Dispute which he maintained against T. S.
at Cambridge, Aug. 1699. in company with G. Whitehead, and another Quaker,
about the Trinity. The said T S. argued thus; (...).

If the father, Son and Holy Ghost are three He Is, Then there are Three
Persons, But there are Three He Is, (...),


Fox. What mean you by three he is?


T. S Three that may be pointed at; He, He, He.


Fox. I do not like that Argument.


T. S. Are you three Persons that dispute against me?


Fox Yea.


T. S. Prove it.


Fox. We are in three places, therefore three Persons?


T S. therefore replied, The Father, Son and H. Ghost have been in Three
Places, and therefore Three Persons; for at the Baptism of Christ, Jesus came
up, the Holy Ghost came down, and the Father in Heaven.


Fox. Persons have Flesh and Blood?


T. S. Angels have not Flesh and Blood, yet they are Persons.


Fox. They cannot be Three Persons, because they are not visible in Three
Places?


T S. If Christ was Man and the holy Ghost was in the form of a Dove, then they
were both seen.


Fox. Prove that they were seen in several places?


T. S. One was seen in the Water, the other out.


Fox. Prove they were seen?


T. S. Many beheld them.


Fox. The Holy Ghost could not be seen.


T. S. He was in the form of a Dove, therefore he could be seen.


Fox. Not in the form of a Dove, but in the likeness.


Hereat some langhing, Fox answered, That he was seen, but not visible.

Surely (said one) his Religion, Reason and Wits are all lost, for he runs
beyond Reason and Sense to defend his Tenet.

Behold! how this wonderful deep Fox was confounded in defending this Heresy,
which was the heresy of Sabellius, who affirmed, That in the divine Essence,
there were three Names, but denied that there were Three distinct Subsistences
or Persons, as Fox and the Quakers do. Now the Name [ Person] was warrantably
applied to the holy Trinity by the ancient Fathers, for Reasons too large to
set down here; but most properly the name Person is applied, because personal
acts are throughout the Scripture ascribed both to Father, Son and holy Ghost.

But here we have one Proof more of W. Penns Sincerity in that he says, G. Fox
was an Original, and no man's Copy; yet we see in this, so likewise in all his
other Heresies, he has exactly copied after the ancient Heretics condemned by
the Church: I will not say G Fox knew any thing of the ancient Heresies, only
good Wits jump't, and that so exactly, as shwes that both they and he were
taught by the same Master.

An Abstract of the Oath of Abjuration, subscribed by the three Quakers of the
Council, Aug. 1703. at Burlington, and after by 21 Quakers of the Assembly of
New Jersey.
We whose Names are under-writen do sincerely Promise and solemnly Declare in
the Presence of Almighty God, that we will bear Faith and true Allegience to
her Majesty Queen Anne and will her defend to the utmost of our Power -- And to
the utmost of our Power Support Maintain and Defend the Limitation and
Succession of the Crown, against [the pretended King] James, and all other
Persons whatsoever -- These things we do solemnly and sincerely declare,
according to the Express Words by us spoken, and according to the plain and
common sense and understanding of the same words, without any Equivocation,
mental Evasion or secret Reservasion whatsoever. -- And we do make this
Recognition and Promise heartily, willingly and truly, upon the true Faith of a
Christian.

Samuel Jennings. Francis Davenport. George Deacon. and the rest,
We the Subscribers of this Declaration, wherein are these words, viz. We do
faithfully promise to the utmost of (...) Power to (...) Support, Maintain and
Defend the Limitation and Succession of the Crown, etc. Do declare our true
intent and meaning is, to do ALL and EVERY thing according to our Duty, in
order thereunto, Provided, That this be not understood, construed or taken,
that we hereby oblige our selves to use Force and Arms, which for Conscience
sake we cannot do in this or any other Action, to the destroying the Lives of
Men.

OBserve, Reader: He that engages to Defend to the utmost of his Power,
according to the common sense of the words, He does Engage to do it both in
Person and Estate, [if he has it] for so all the World understands the words
[Defend to the Utmost of Our Power] I say this is the common sense of the
words, let the Quakers deny it if they can or dare.

And you see above, that the Quakers have engaged to Defend to the Utmost of
their Power, according to the common sense of the words; Therefore they have
engaged to do it in Person and Estate, as their Ability, and Occasion is. And
yet almost in the next breath, they declare they cannot do it in Person. Can
such Equivocators as these be fit Persons to be trusted in the Government?

But will they Defend with their Estates? Will they pay to maintain War or
Fighting? Have they no mental Evasion or secret Reservation in this? for we see
(as above) that they have solemnly declared, they have none: Yes indeed, they
have; for since the year 1660 it is known to be the Quakers avowed Principle to
deny to pay, and cannot pay so much as one penny to maintain War or Fighting.
And this Samuel Jenings asserted before my Lord Cornbury at the Council Table
at Amboy, the whole Assembly being present, viz. That they could no more pay
toward War or Fighting, than they could Fight or bear Arms.

Behold here! The Quakers have first engaged to defend the Queen, etc. to the
utmost of their Power, and that as Defense is commonly understood, without
Evasion or Reservation whatsoever, and yet at the same time declare their
Intentions are, Not to do it neither in Person nor Estate: This is such an
Equivocating Contradiction, as is not [I believe] to be parallelled in the
whole World. The Jesuits of Old-Rome are but Dunces to these Quakers; Let the
Nimble Fingured Miller, C. Pusey, tell us in his next Print, how and which way
they can defend the Queen, etc. to the Utmost of their Power, and yet neither
do it in Person nor Estate, and that too, as [Defend] is commonly understood;
if he can do this, and clear his Brethern from the Guilt of Perjury, I will
then be engaged he shall be set in the Legend for a Worker of Miracles along
with the great Fox, and the rest of the Saints both of Old and New-Rome; Mean
time, let the World Judge of this piece of Quaker-Sincerity.

But I must do S. Jenings Justice in this case, for he also said, that they did
not expect to be gainers by refusing to pay; meaning (I suppose) that their
Goods might be taken from them. But this is what they have always called
Persecution; therefore this makes the matter worse; for here the Queen and
those in Authority under her are rendered Persecutors, and by the
Quaker-Chronicles pass for such in the next Age. Now this is at least a passive
Disobedience to the Law; and is not their defending in any respect, much less a
doing it to the Utmost of their Power, heartily and willingly declared?

I say again, What Government can be safe in trusting to such a Quicksilver
Tribe of men, whom no words will tie, though never so expressly spoken? And they
are the same in most other matters. As in Swearing, they cannot in Conscience
Swear, but they can take an Oath, and their Conscience in this Country is
tayled to their Brethrens Conscience in England; for the Magistrates here could
not persuade their Conscience, [for some time] to take their own New Oath, till
they heard that their Brethren took it in England.

But now, Suppose the French should beset us: The Quakers count themselves no
way engaged to assist us in defense of out Queen and Country, Therefore they
are free, (if any tempting occasion offer) to Join with the French against us.
For, as to their Saying, they cannot for Conscience sake bear Arms to Fight, or
[as they word it] use Force and Arms; this is Deceit and a Lie, as I could
instance in several matters of fact: One pregnant Proof of this has happened so
lately as the last August, in the County of Burlington, where a report was, that
a part of French were Lucking about a Branch of Anco^u Creek, the Quakers
thereabouts got together in Arms, in a Military posture, with their Guns
charged, to meet the French; but you must Note, it was on their own account,
not at the Command of the Government, that they thus took up Arms; Therefore
what their design was, who can tell, seeing no Credit can be given to what they
say or subscribe; but it must be either to Defend themselves, or Join with the
French against us* If to defend themselves, that they so bore Arms, surely they
ought much rather to do it at the Command of the Government. No, say they we
cannot for Conscience sake do that. And thus do they make a Stalking-horse of
Conscience. This is Quaker Sincerity, being Hypocrisy at the least, grand
Hypocrisy, and ought to be noticed by the Government.

Now let not C. Pusey in his next Print tell us, this is a Lie, and that these
were no Quakers that thus bore Arms, for they are approved Quakers, Listed as
such under the Quaker-Banner, by Certificate under the hands of
Burlington-Meeting-Men, and by them given in to the Military Officers; and that
they thus bore Arms is too obvious to be denied by any but such as are endued
with the abovementioned Quaker-Sincerity. From which, Good Lord Deliver us.

Daniel Leeds.

Postscript.
SInce the foregoing was written, I met with the Quaker-Almanack, put out by
J. T. and C. P. for this year 1705. It Is a Two-handed Piece, wherein they would
make their Readers think, that they have Conquor'd me on both sides. One will
have me to be a mere Ignoramus in Art, and 'tother a Renogado in Religion, and
consequently it must be as they say, That I am not fit for Religious nor Civil
Society. High Charges! But if this be the worst they can do to me, I think my
self the more happy in that they have said as bad of some of the best Men of
our Age.

First, As to J. T's Vapors against me, if it would edify, or be of advantage
to Mankind, I would Confute him; for it is some Errors of the Press which he
harps most upon, and would make to be mine; nay, and he rakes them out of old
Almanacks too; whenas he knows I could severely lash him with the same Whip
from all his (calculated) Almanacks, and his Book too; but I have now other
Fish to fry. His grudging me the use of his Book, is like selling me
Roast-Meat, and then beating me with the Spit, but what less can I expect from
a Quaker? Gadbury would have scorned to have done so by him, for copying after
his Ephemerides several years in his Book. But in short, he is welcome to me
to go on with his Yearly Calculations; he has, (it may be) more leisure than I;
and I shall make a shift to write an Almanac, (perhaps as true as his) either
with his help or without it: And let him not be grieved that my Almanac sells
better than his.

And as to C. Pusey's Reply to my Almanac, he has not answered one quarter
part of it, but runs upon other matters, to bring his Reader off from the Scent
of their Heresies: In his Answers he copies after the London-Quakers Answers,
and dares venture no further than they have done to his hands. As to other
things he sees it his safest way to tell me, He has not seen the Books out
which I brought my Quotations; and that he thinks is sufficient to Refute me;
or else he tells me, G. K's Quaker-Books say so and so. But this is hard
patching up Religion, when one Quaker-Book must be brought to mend or justify
another. And as to the London-Quakers, alas! They are baffled in their Answers,
and Confounded to their perpetual Shame, by the Author of the Book, called, The
Snake in the Grass, in his Defense and Reply, as all who read those Books may
see.

But has C. Pusey not one word to say to what I have charged of their Monstrous
Notions concerning Christ? No. They still stand Guilty of the Charge often
proved against them, viz. That when they speak or write of the Christians
Christ, they mean not a word of what they say; for they will not say, nor dare
not confess, That they believe in a (...) now in Heaven, and that Christ is
now, and forever to come, truly and really a Man, in true and proper Humane
Nature, Without all other men. No, They have been several Times provoked to
give us a Proof of their Sincerity, in answering to this Christian Confession,
but they will not. And their refusing to confess to this, bewrays them, and
discovers the Cloven Foot to all Intelligent Christians, and is another
repeated Proof, That they Mean not a Word of what they say concerning Christ
Without; and therefore are Implacable Enemies to the Christian Religion.

And whereas I noted in my Preface, That Peter Fretwell condemned Eliz. Fenton
for being baptized, and that therefore she must know a bitter Day of
Repentance; and that Mary Wheat confirmed the same. Now if there be occasion
Eliz. Fenton will make Oath to the Truth of this before a Magistrate.

But behold what a sincere Quaker-Turn-off they have invented for this. Why,
they say, It was for her evil Life and Conversation that Fretwell said she must
know a bitter Day of Repentance for, and not for being Baptized. But do they
tell what this Evil was that she was guilty of? No, No; have a care of that;
you shall not catch them there; for it was past their skill to tell that: They
know that none of her Neighbors can charge her with so much as a Spot in her
Life and Coversation, those many years that she has lived both a Wife and a
Widow among them: If they could, no doubt, we had had it in Print, now at this
Pinch: Therefore let those her Accusers think of what Reward they must have for
such slanderous Lies against the Innocent.

But why would the Quakers now deny their Banters against Baptism? Is it
because they begin to be ashamed of them? Truly I should be glad to be an
Instrument to bring them to that. No, but here is a Snake in the Grass, for
they use their Arts of Confessing and Denying (as occasion requires) only to
avoid the Odium of the World; for besides their former Outrage against Baptism
(which they still justify) C. Pusey in page 3. (even while he would take his
Friend Fretwell off from speaking against Baptism) does himself bring a
bantering Scoff against it, and falsifies Luther and Bucer by perverting their
sense to make them speak against it too. And all this he does under a deceitful
pretense, That it is only Infant Baptism that the Quakers deny; whenas it is
evident that both he and they shoot their poisoned Arrows against Baptism it
Self. Their Practice proves this to all that know them, viz. That it is All
manner of Water Baptism which they deny: They Practice none.

Nay, C. P. has the Impudence to deny [after his fashion] that W. Penn calls it
Poison, to believe or have faith in the History of Christ's outward
Manifestation. But what they expect to gain by this way of answering Books, I
know not. But this I know, that several who were zealous Quakers have forsaken
them for the sake of this very Doctrine of William Penn's, and that other,
where he denis The Outward Person, JESUS, who was born of the Virgin, to be
properly the Son of God. I say, the Quakers refusing to condemn these two
Doctrines of W. P. has caused many (and some very sensible Persons, as they
know) to forsake their Society, Thanks be to God for it. And as the Proverb
says, It Is an ill Wind that blows no body Good.

I shall conclude with one Instance of what I noted before, that C. P. would
lead his Reader from the Scent of their Heresies, by running from the Charge to
other Matters* You must Note, that I had provoked him to say (if he durst) That
they did the Scriptures that honor as they did their own Books, viz. as ever
to read so much as one Chapter of them in any of their Meetings, etc. Now C.
Pusey knowing their own guiltiness in the case, instead of giving me a plain
honest answer, he falls foul upon the Author of the Snake, etc. and then brings
Cirtificates to prove that their Schoolboys read them in their Schools. But,
Pray what is this to the purpose? Any body knows that the Bible is as necessary
a Book to learn Scholars to read in, as another Book. But this is not reading
them in their Meetings, as they do their own Books and Epistles. This is one of
Friend Caleb's go-by's, and this is Quaker-plainness too, which he gives
instead of answers to me.
