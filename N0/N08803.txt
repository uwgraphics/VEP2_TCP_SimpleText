AURI CAECUS AMORE, VENDIIT HIC PATRIAM. PRINTED IN THE YEAR M,DCC,LXIX,

JOIN OR DIE.
Nor the harsh Threats of Tyrants bearing Rule,
Nor Guile-cloak'd-Meekness of each cringing TOOL;
Shall shake Our Firmness, or divide That Love
Which the strong Ties of social Friendship prove.

Esteem and Respect for the MAN, Who has gloriously distinguished HIMSELF; By
asserting the RIGHTS and LIBERTIES of AMERICA, In a Manner, that renders HIM an
HONOR to his Education, A PUBLIC BLESSING to his Country: And will
immortalize his Name with RENOWN, to the latest Ages of Time.

AN Elegy, etc.
I.
WHEN the high Insults of a T -- t's Law,
All Rules of Truth and Equity o'ersway:
With Hopes to keep in Slavery and Awe,
A People known too virtuous to obey.
II.
When Subjects grieved petition for Redress,
But find no Access to the R -- l Ear:
Since Pimps destroy their Wishes of Success
And false, deceive, though Reason would appear.
III.
When Pride, Ambition, with the Stain of Lust,
Base, flattering Idols of a transient Hour!
Strive to overwhelm a civil STATE, and burst
With baneful Gluts of Vanity and Power:
IV.
When Independants with deceitful Voice,
To neighboring Christians meek Submission teach:
^it REBELLION, that mankind rejoice,
To prostitute such doctrines as THEY preach?
V.
When sordid LUST that Concubine of POWER,
Who deeply rowls in Luxury and Pride,
Impatient, grasps thus greedy to devour
The Life of FREEDOM, and in triumph ride.
VI.
But when some base contaminated SOUL
Far worse than Brute in Nature or in Heart!
Gives up the TRUTH to impious Control,
And prides to act so scandalous a Part.
VII.
Shall then, no just, no mediating Plan,
Be formed against such desolating Scheme:
To foil the Project, or condemn the Man,
Whose Country's Ruin is his greatest Aim!
VIII.
Who, but such Villain's Favorite or Friend,
Would ere his well-known Wickedness conceal?
The more his basest Actions they defend,
They still more secret Infamy reveal.
IX.
Lost to all Sense of Honor and Contempt,
Proof against fears of aggravating Shame!
Though deep in Guilt, they daringly attempt
To wipe away its Consciousness and Stain.
X.
But when the Guilt of Scandal and Disgrace,
Blocks up the glorious Avenue to FAME:
It leaves eternal Misery on a Race,
Who bear their scornful Memory or Name.
XI.
O B --!great thy Villainy his been!
Schem'd to destroy our Liberty and Peace:
The public Eye attentively has seen
Thy base Endeavors, and has watched our Ease.
XII.
Thou, weaned from Love to every Thing humane,
From honest Rules ingratefully do swerve;
And thinking TRUTH thy Infamy or Bane,
Do cheat a Sovereign whom you're sworn to serve.
XIII.
Misguided thus by Villainy and Lies,
Those Seeds of Discord, Hatred, and Revenge!
Thou base, obliged our Sovereign to despise
His loyal Subjects, and in Wrath avenge.
XIV.
Raised from low State a BEGGAR on the Earth,
Thy Name through Life is tainted with Disgrace
Revered by FEW for Eminence or Worth!
Despised by MOST, a Scandal to the Race!
XV.
Though in this mean and despicable State
Reserved, nor fit for Statesman or a Guide!
O strange Reserve! O Miracle of Fate!
That thou over freeborn People should preside.
XVI.
That People too, whose Loyalty and Love,
Stand high in ancient Memory of Time;
Against whom, thou joy'st so tyrannous to prove,
Will with Contempt perpetuate thy Crime.
XVII.
Pleased with the Sound of baronetted Fame,
Thou scarce can bear Mortality in View:
Nor think that injured LIBERTY will claim
Severest Justice, as a VILLAIN's due.
XVIII.
But know vain Fool! that Title's a Disgrace,
When inbred Vice the Conscience does control:
Thy Country's Wrath thy Punishment shall raise,
Since thou have dared to sacrifice the Whole.
XIX.
Sworn to strict Union in fraternal LOVE,
Resolved no FROWNS shall drive US to OBEY:
No guileful Arts of TYRANNY shall move
Our tame Submission to it is lawless SWAY.
XX.
Thou, Old in Sin! the vilest Course did take,
But TRUTH much wronged constrained thee to forbear:
And conquered all thy vain Attempts to break
The CHAIN which links our UNITY and CARE.
XXI.
So, when foul Minds degenerate by Use,
They catch each Form of Malice in Disguise:
Conviction springs from infamous Abuse,
And against FREE STATES their Stratagems devise.
XXII.
Thou in thy Course too rapidly have run,
And did a Gracious Sovereign deceive,
But now, ere half thy cursed Work is done
Have found him grown too jealous to believe.
XXIII.
Since thou must cease in Tyranny to reign,
Say, does not Conscience sting thee with her Dart?
Whilst keen Remorses aggravate thy Pain,
And brood fresh Horrors round thy flinty Heart.
XXIV.
Such Minds in Life no Comfort can possess:
Say, if when Pangs of Sorrow interpose,
Despair, Companion of the troubled breast!
Has not intruded on thy soft Repose?
XXV.
Bewail, vile Wretch! in penitential Tears,
Past Time misspent to ruminate on Sin!
A Sinner's thought most horrible appears
When Guilt, like Snakes, lies gnawing him within.
XXVI.
Though, for Self Ends, the Baseness of thy Crime,
A while lay dormant, and but known in Part,
Till TRUTH emerging from the Womb of Time
Betrayed the Malice of thy Brutal Heart.
XXVII.
What now avail thy Subtilty or Pride,
Thy secret Friends to counsel or advise?
No Mediums false plain Enmity can hide,
Thy Love's but bare Profession in Disguise.
XXVIII.
Degraded Worth Soon dwindles to Disgrace,
When the Soul's meanness forwards such attempt:
No "Mask of ZEAL" will Turpitude deface,
Or guard thy Name from popular Contempt.
XXIX.
Go thou! but dare not with a LIE deceive,
This thou have tried, but shamefully have failed,
For None mistrustful Credit will believe,
Since Vice seems on thy Character entailed.
XXX.
Go! then, entreat thy Soverign to be kind,
Or Death to snatch from temporary Woe!
A Wretch, for Life most properly consigned,
To constant Shame and Misery below!
XXXI.
If Justice should thy Wickedness connive,
And banish thee, Disturber of our Ease!
Where, thou unhurt, thy Baseness may revive,
Go! welcomed Exile from a Land of Peace!
XXXII.
Go! where Slave-born MAHOMETANS do dwell,
Whose menial souls in Servitude delight:
Then thou, (if Pleas of Ignorance prevail,)
Base mind Man, may sacrifice their Right.
XXXIII.
But if rash FATE in Justice has reserved,
Some secret Curse, thy Title to inherit:
Be thou for this due Punishment preserved,
To beg thy Bread, as thou have begged thy Merit.
XXXIV.
Go! loaded deep with Curses on thy Head!
To some dark Corner of the World repair,
Where the bright Sun no Pleasant Beams can shed,
And spend thy Life in Horror and Despair.
XXXV.
Implore Forgiveness of indulgent Heaven,
Unless DELAY this Favor has impaired:
By Sin, to which thou knowingly art given,
Almighty Vengeance thou have boldly dared.
XXXVI.
Fly! to some distant Assylum or Clime,
Far from the Sight of Christians or of Men!
Where Fame, unnotic'd like the Wastes of Time,
In the poor Praises of thy self must end.
XXXVII.
If thou can find some secret Place below,
Go where thy Meanness never has been known!
Retreat with all those Parasites It is conjectured to be here meant the right
Worshipful Society of Tide Waiters, and other Dunghill Upstarts, who play
Tricks with their Consciences, and reverence a new Set of false Idols, who may
be honestly supposed the Natives of the City Golgotha, a Place remarkable for
empty Skulls.
you know,
And there erect in Majesty thy Throne.
XXXVIII.
Lost in thy Sway of Avarice and Pride,
Dependant Tools Subservient to they Laws:
Shall joy with thee ingloriously to hide
TRUTH, which was deemed injurious to thy Cause:
XXXIX.
Through every Scene we eyed each treacherous Deed
Sprung from the foul Contagion of ADVICE!
No more thy useless Proselytes we need
To mend an AGE corrupted by thy Vice.
XL.
When public FAME degenerates in MEN,
Whom fordid Views most sottishly beguile:
No Glimpse of Worth such Characters attend
Which the base MORALS of their Life desile.
XLI.
When Conscience yielding to the tinsel MIND,
All cursed Arts does shamefully employ:
Improved in Sin, thus nat'rally inclined,
Our sacred RIGHTS shall threaten to destroy.
XLII.
Roused by such FEARS, ill Omens of Distress!
Fair FREEDOM's SONS too jealous of her Foes:
Proud that her CAUSE should animate their Breast,
Unawed by thee, thy daring Threats oppose.
XLIII.
May thou, vile Traitor to thy Country's Good!
Whose Heart no Thoughts of Gratitude can bear:
When thou Life's doomed Afflictions have withstood,
In REALMS below the LYAR'S portion share.
XLIV.
PLUTO, in kindness to an injured Land,
Pour forth thy Vengeance treasured up in Store:
Nor cool in Pity's Stream thy flaming Brand,
When victim'd Tyrants shall the (...) implore.
FORTY-FIVE.
B --, though thou of titled Fame may boast,
Thy Soul shall pass from Memory and Mind:
And like the transient Shadow of a Ghost,
Leave not her Tracks of INFAMY behind.
-- I DEDECUS! I NOSTRUM! --
