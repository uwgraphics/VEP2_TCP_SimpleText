A Looking GLASS FOR THE TIMES. OR, The former Spirit of New England revived in
this Generation.

To which is added, The Reports from the Lords of the Committee of Councils,
and the KING'S Order relating to the People called Quakers in New England.

By Peter Folger.

Let all that read these Verses know,
That I intend something to show
About our War, how it has been,
And also what is the chief Sin,
That God does so with us contend,
And when these Wars are like to end.
Read then in Love; do not despise
What here is set before thine Eyes.
Printed in the Year 1763.

A Looking Glass, etc.
New England for these many Years
has had both Rest and Peace,
But now the Case is otherwise;
our Trouble does increase.
The plague of War is now begun
in some great Colonies,
And many Towns as desolate
we may see with our Eyes.
The Loss of many goodly Men
we may lament also,
Who in the War have lost their lives,
and fallen by our Foe.
Our Women also they have took,
and Children very small;
Great Cruelty they have used
to some, though not to all.
The Enemy that has done this,
are very foolish Men;
Yet God does make of them a Rod
to punish us for Sin.
If we then truly turn to God,
he will remove his Ire,
And will forthwith take this his Rod
And cast it into Fire.
Let us then search what is the Sin
that God does punish for;
And when found out cast it away,
and ever it abhor.
Sure it is not chiefly for those Sins
that Magistrates do name,
And make good Laws for to suppress,
and execute the same.
But it is for that same crying Sin,
that Rulers will not own,
And that whereby much Cruelty
to brethren has been shown:
The Sin of Persecution
such Laws established;
By which Laws they have gone so far,
as Blood has touched Blood.
It is now Forty Years ago,
since some of these were made,
Which was the Ground and Rise of all
the persecuting Trade.
Then many worthy Persons were
banished to the Woods,
Where they among the Natives did
lose their most precious Bloods.
And since that, many Godly Men
have been to Prison sent;
They have been fined and whipped also,
and suffered Banishment.
The Cause of this their Suffering
was not for any Sin,
But for the Witness that they bare
against Babes Sprinkling.
Of later time there has been some
Men come into this Land,
To warn the Rulers of their Sins,
as I do understand.
They called on all, both great and small,
to fear God and repent;
And for their Testimonies thus
they suffered Punishment.
Yea, some of them they did affirm,
that they were sent of God
To testify to great and small,
that God would send his Rod
Against those Colonies, because
they did make Laws not good;
And if those Laws were not repealed,
the end would be in Blood.
And though that these were harmless Men,
and did no hurt to any,
But lived well like honest Men,
as testified by many;
Yet did these Laws entrap them so,
that they were put to Death,
And could not have the Liberty
to speak near their last Breath.
But these Men were, as I have heard,
against our College Men;
And this was out of doubt to me,
that which was most their Sin.
They did reprove all Hirelings,
with a most Sharp Reproof,
Because they knew not how to preach,
till sure of Means enough.
Now to the Sufferings of these Men,
I have but gave a hint;
Because that in George Bishop's Book
you may see all in print.
But may we know the Counselors
that brought our Rulers in,
To be so guilty as they are,
of the aforesaid Sin?
They were the Tribe of Ministers,
as they are said to be,
Who always to our Magistrates
must be the Eyes to see.
These are the Men that by their Wits,
have spun so fair a Thread,
That now themselves and others are
of Natives in a Dread.
What need is there of such a Fear,
if we have done no Ill?
But it is because that we have been
not doing of God's Will.
When Cain had slain his Brother, then
began this Fear to be,
That every Man would do to him
the same that did him see.
The Scripture does declare the Cause
why Cain did kill his Brother;
It was because the Deeds of one
was good, and not the other.
Because that God did Favor show
To Abel more than he,
That was in verity the thing
that Envy could not see.
Then let us all, both great and small
take heed how we do fight
Against the Spirit of the Lord,
which is our highest Light.
Let Magistrates and Ministers
consider what they do;
Let them repeal those evil Laws,
and break those Bands in two,
Which have been made as Traps and Snares
to catch the Innocents,
And whereby it has gone so far,
to Acts of Violence.
I see you write your selves in Print,
the Balm of Gilead;
Then do not act as if you were
like Men that are half mad.
If you can heal the Land, what is
the Cause things are so bad?
I think instead of that, you make
the Hearts of People sad.
Is this a Time for you to press,
to draw the Blood of those
That are your Neighbors and your Friends,
as if you had no Foes.
Yea, some there are, as I have heard,
have lately found out Tricks
To put the Cause of all the War
upon the Heretics,
Or rather on some Officers,
that now begin to slack
The Execution of those Laws,
whose Consequence is black.
I do affirm to you, if that
be really your mind,
You must go turn another Leaf,
before that Peace you find.
Now loving Friends and Countrymen,
I wish we may be wise;
It Is now a time for every Man
to see with his own Eyes.
It Is easy to provoke the Lord
to send among us War;
It Is easy to do Violence,
to envy and to jar;
To show a Spirit that is high,
to scorn and domineer;
To pride it out, as if there were,
no God to make us fear;
To covet what is not our own,
to cheat and to oppress;
To live a Life that might free us
from Acts of Righteousness;
To swear and lie, and to be drunk,
to backbite one another;
To carry Tales that may do hurt
and Mischief to our Brother!
To live in such Hypocrisy,
as Men may think us good,
Although our Hearts within are full
of Evil, and of Blood.
All these and many Evils more
are easy for to do;
But to repent, and to reform,
we have no Strength unto.
Let us then seek for help from God,
and turn to him that smite;
Let us take heed, that at no time,
we sin against our Light.
Let Us bear our testimony plain
against Sin in High and Low;
And see that we no Cowards be,
to hide the Light we know.
When Jonathan is called to Court,
shall we as Stander's by,
Be still and have no Word to speak,
but suffer him to die?
If that you say you cannot help,
things will be as they are;
I tell you true, it is plain and clear,
those Words may come from fear.
That you shall lose some carnal things,
if you do speak for God;
And here you go the nearest way
to taste deep of his Rod.
It Is true, there are some times indeed
of Silence to the Meek;
Not ever, for the Lord does say,
there is a time to speak.
Be vigilant then for to see
the movings of your heart,
And you will know right well the time
when you shall act your Part.
I would not have you for to think,
though I have wrote so much,
That I hereby do throw a Stone
at Magistrates as such.
The Rulers in the Country I
do own them in the Lord;
And such as are for Government,
with them I do accord.
But that which I intend hereby,
is that they would keep bound,
And meddle not with God's Worship,
for which they have no ground.
And I am not alone herein,
there is many hundreds more
That have for many Years ago
spoke much upon that Score.
Indeed I really believe
it is not your Business
To meddle with the Church of Christ,
in Matters more or less.
There Is work enough to do besides,
to judge in mine and thine,
To succor Poor and Fatherless,
that is the Work in fine.
And I do think that now you find
enough of that to do;
Much more at such a Time as this,
as there is War also.
Indeed I count it very low,
for People in these Days,
To ask the Rulers for their leave
to serve God in his Ways.
I count it worse in Magistrates
to use the Iron Sword,
To do that Work which Christ alone
will do by his own Word.
The Church may now go stay at home,
there is nothing for to do;
Their Work is all cut out by Law,
and almost made up too.
Now Reader, least you should mistake,
in what I said before
Concerning Minister's, I think
to write a few Words more.
I would not have you for to think
that I am such a Fool,
To write against Learning, as such,
or to cry down a School.
But it is that Popish College way,
that I intend hereby,
Where Men are mewed up in a Cage,
fit for all Villainy.
But I shall leave this puddle Stuff
to Neighbors at the Door,
That can speak more unto such things,
upon a knowing Score.
And now these Men though never so bad,
when they have learned their Trade,
They must come in and bear a Part,
whatever Laws are made.
I cannot but wonder for to see
our Magistrates and Wise,
That they sit still, and suffer them
to ride on them, not rise,
And stir them up to do that Work,
that Scripture Rule there wants,
To persecute and persecute
those that they judge are Saints.
There Is one thing more that I believe
is worse than all the rest,
They vilify the Spirit of God,
and count School Learning best.
If that a Boy has learned his Trade,
and can the Spirit disgrace,
Then he is lifted up on high,
and needs must have a Place.
But I shall leave this dirty Stuff,
and give but here a hint,
Because that you have Cradock's Book,
and may see more in Print.
There are some few, it may be, that
are clear of this same Trade;
And of those Men, I only say,
these Verses are not made.
Now for the length of time, how long
these Wars are like to be,
I may speak something unto that,
if Men will reason see.
The Scripture does point out the time,
and it is as we do choose,
For to obey the Voice of God,
or else for to refuse.
The Prophet Jeremy does say,
when War is threatened sore,
That if Men do repent and turn,
God will afflict no more.
But such a turning unto God,
as is but Verbally,
When Men refuse for to reform,
it is not worth a fly.
It Is hard for you, as I do hear,
though you be under Rod,
To say to Israel Go, you,
and serve the Lord your God.
Though you do many Prayers make,
and add Fasting thereto,
Yet if your Hands be full of Blood,
all this will never do.
The end that God does send his Sword,
is that we might amend;
Then if that we reform aright,
the War will shortly end*
New England they are like the Jews,
as like, as like can be;
They made large Promises to God,
at home and at the Sea:
They did proclaim free Liberty,
they cut the Calf in twain,
They past between the Part thereof:
O this was all in vain!
For since they came into this Land,
they floared to and fro,
Sometimes their Brethren may be free,
while hence to Prison go,
According as the times to go,
and Weather is abroad,
So we can serve our selves sometimes,
and sometimes serve the Lord.
But let us hear what God does say
to such backsliding Men,
That can with Ease so break their Vows,
and soon go back again. Ier. 34.

He says he will proclaim for them,
a Freedom to the Sword,
Because they would not fear him so
as to obey his Word.
This Liberty unto the Sword,
he has proclaimed for us,
And we are like to feel it long,
if Matters do go thus.
It Is better for our Magistrates,
to shorten time, I say,
By breaking of those Bands in two,
that look an evil way.
You do profess your selves to be
Men that do pray always,
Then do not keep such evil Laws,
as may serve at wet Days.
If that the Peace of God did rule
with Power in our Heart,
Then outward War would flee away,
and Rest would be our Part.
If we could love our Brethren,
and do to them, I say,
As we would they should do to us,
we should be quiet straightway.
But if that we a smiting go
of Fellow Servants so,
No marvel if our Wars increase,
and things so heavy go.
It Is like that some may think and say,
our War would not remain,
If so be that a thousand more
of Natives were but slain.
Alas! these are but foolish thoughts,
God can make more arise,
And if that there were none at all,
he can make War with Flys.
It is the Presence of the Lord
must make our Foes to shake,
Or else it is like he will ever long,
know how to make us quake.
Let us lie low before the Lord,
in all Humility,
And then we shall with Asa see
our Enemies to fly.
But if that we do leave the Lord,
and trust in Fleshly Arm,
Then it is no wonder if that we
do hear more News of Harm.
Let Us have our Faith and Hope in God,
and trust in him alone,
And then no doubt this Storm of War
it quickly will be gone.
Thus Reader, I in Love to all,
leave these few Lines with thee,
Hoping that in the Substance we
shall very well agree.
If that you do mislike the Verse,
for its uncomely Dress,
I tell thee true, I never thought
that it would pass the Press.
If any at the Matter kick,
it is like he is galled at Heart,
And that is the Reason why he kicks,
because he finds it smart.
I am for Peace, and not for War,
and that is the Reason why
I write more plain than some Men do,
that use to daub and lie.
But I shall cease and set my Name
to what I here insert,
Because to be a Libeller,
I hate it with my Heart.
From Nant ucket.
Sherbon Town, where now I dwell,
my Name I do put here,
Without Offense your real Friend,
it is PETER FOLGER.

At the Court at St. James's, the 2d Day of June 1724.
PRESENT, The KING's most Excellent Majesty.

His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. A. B. of Canterbury. Lord Chancellor.
Lord President. Lord Privy Seal. Lord Chamberlain. Duke of Roxburg. Duke of
Newcastle. Earl of Westmorland. Lord Visc Townshend. Lord Visc. Torrington. Mr.
Speaker of the House of Commons. Mr. Vice Chamberlain William Pultney, Esquire


UPON reading this Day at the Board, a Report from the Right Honorable the
Lords of the Committee of Councils, upon the Petition of Thomas Richardson and
Richard Partridge, on behalf of Joseph Anthony, John Sisson, John Akin, and
Phillip Taber, Prisoners in the common Goal at New Bristol, in his Majesty's
Province of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, for not assessing the
Inhabitants of the Towns of Dartmouth and Tiverton, the additional Taxes of one
Hundred Pounds, and Seventy two Pounds eleven Shillings, imposed upon them by
an Act passed there in the Year 1722, which appears to be for the Maintenance
of Presbyterian Ministers, who are not of their Persuasion; and also in behalf
of their Friends called Quakers in general, who are frequently under great
Sufferings for Conscience sake in that Government: By which Report it appears,
that their Lordships are of Opinion, that it may be advisable for his Majesty
to remit the said additional Taxes, so imposed on the said two Towns, and to
discharge the said Persons from Goal.

His Majesty in Council taking the said Report into Consideration, is
graciously pleased to approve thereof, and hereby to remit the said additional
Taxes of one Hundred Pounds, and Seventy two Pounds eleven Shillings, which
were by the said Act to be assessed on the said Towns of Dartmouth and
Tiverton. And his Majesty is hereby further pleased to order, that the said
Joseph Anthony, John Sisson John Akin, and Phillip Taber, be immediately
released from their Imprisonment on account thereof. And the Governor,
Lieutenant Governor, and Commander in Chief for the time being, of his
Majesty's said Province of the Massachusetts Bay, and all others whom it may
concern, are to take Notice. and yield due Obedience hereunto.

Temple Stanyan.

To the KING's most Excellent Majesty,
May it please your Majesty,
IN Obedience to an Order in Council from the late Lords Justices, during your
Majesty's Absence abroad, bearing date the 24th day of October last, we did
make a Representation upon an Act passed in the Province of the
Massachusetts Bay in New England in 1722. entitled, An Act for apportioning
and assessing a Tax of Six Thousand two Hundred thirty two Pounds thirteen
Shillings and eleven Pence. Since which Time another Act mentioned in the said
Order of Reference. passed the 29th day of May, 1723. entitled. An Act for
apportioning and assessing a Tax of Six Thousand two Hundred and five Pounds
fifteen Shillings and seven Pence Halfpenny, is come to our Hands; by which Act
a Tax is laid in express Terms upon the Inhabitants of Dartmouth and Tiverton,
for the Support of a Presbyterian, whom they call an Orthodox Minister, which
falls almost entirely upon the Quakers; there being very few Inhabitants of any
other Persuasion in these two Towns. But as by the Charter granted to this
Province, a free and absolute Liberty of Conscience to all Christians (except
Papists) was intended to have been their Foundation and Support; and as by
several Laws passed there, it seems to have been laid down as a just and
equitable Rule, that the Majority of each Town-Congregation should have the
Choice of their own Teachers, we cannot see why the Quakers should be refused
this Liberty in the Towns where they are so great a Majority, and be obliged to
maintain a Teacher of different Persuasion. Wherefore we humbly propose to your
Majesty, that this Act may be repealed.

Which is most humbly submitted, Whitehall, May 6. 1724. A true Copy,

Test. R. Partridge.
