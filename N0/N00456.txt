FINIS
A Short Body of DIVINITY.
THe Scriptures of Divine Authority
A perfect Rule for all* men to walk by^
from thence we learn the living God to know
And what the duty is we to him owe.
Three sacred Persons in the Godhead be
(...) one Power, Substance, and Eternity.
The Father and Christ Jesus, his own Son
The Holy Ghost, and all these 3 are one
God is A most Pure Spirit Infinite
In truth abundant, of great power and might
Most Holy Wise Just good, long Suffering,
Of whom, through whom, to whom is every thing
He made the world, and all that is therein,
Man was made upright but soon fell by sin.
We all do from polluted Parents spring,
And in our flesh there does dwell no good thing
None righteous are, but all of every sort
Have sinned and of God's Glory are come short.
But God so loved us, that he did give
His only Son, that we through him might live.
The Son of God became the Son of Man*
That we might be the Sons of God again*
He Is God and man, the only Mediator
Between the Sons of Men, and their Creator.
He gave himself for our Eternal good.
And wash^ away our sins with his own blood.
What love was this? 'twas love beyond degree.
The Offended dies to set Offenders ^ree.
It Is God that Justifies, (...) shall condemn.
It Is Christ that (...) or rather rose again.
Who also sits on Gods Right-^andon high.
And Interceeds for us continually.
We by one Spirit through him alone,
May have Access unto the Holy One.
If we believe on him that came to save,
Were sure at last Eternal Life to have.
There Is nothing that avads with God above.
But Faith in Jesus Christ which works by love
Hereby we know that we, do love the Lord,
When we do keep the precepts of his Word.
The Lord has showed what he requires as good.
Deal justly, and walk humbly with your God,
Serve him with fear, love him with all your might
Speak ill of none, and give to all their right.
And when you have done all you can confess
The Imperfection of your righteousness
Ascribe the praise of all the good you do.
To him that works the will and deed in you^.
Keep conscience pure and void of all offense,
(...) for death with speed and diligence.
Blessed are the dead that in the Lord do dy^.
Their works do follow them assuredly.
The day is coming when the Dead shall hear.
The voice of Christ and forth with shall appear^
All they to life whose works are good, and right.
All they to death that do in sin delight.
As every man has in the body done,
so shall his Sentence at the last^punc; day run.
The wicked shall be turned into Hell,
The Righteous shall with Christ for-ever dwell.
