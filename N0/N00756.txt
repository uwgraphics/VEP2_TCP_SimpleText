The CHRISTIANITY of the People called QUAKERS Asserted, by GEORE KEITH: In
ANSWER to a Sheet called, A Serious Call to the Quakers etc. Attested by Eight
Priests of the Church of England, called Dr. Isham, Rector of St. Battolphs
Bish^^sgate, Dr. Wincop, Rector of St. Mary abb Church, Dr. Be^ford, Rector of
St. George Battl^^ Lane, Mr. Altham, M. A. Rector of St. Andrew Undershaft, Mr.
Bradford, M. A. Rector of St Mary-le bow. M. Whitfield, M. A. Rect. of St.
Martin at L^^dgate. Mr. Batler, M. A. Rector of St. Mary Aldermanbary. Mr.
Ad^^rs, M. A. Rector of St (...).
And Affirmed by George Keith, or the New Sw^rn De^con.
It Is a marvelous thing, that these Men have no other (...) to oppug^ the
Quakers, but by g^^ss and horrid LIES, and false CALUMNIES, and mere Abuses;
like unto the ^o^ys that ever the worst of the Adversaries of Truth have used
against the True Witnesses of it, sait G. K. in his Presb. and Indep. Visible
Churches, p. 222, 2^0. But It never yet has been proved, nor ever will, That
the Religion professed by the sincere and faithful People called in scorn
Quakers, is either Paganism, or any other thing, THAN REAL CHRISTIANITY, says
G. K. in his Preface to his Serious Appeal.
MEeting with a Sheet, Entitled, A Serious Call; wherein are several
Quotations, already replied unto, in a late Book, Entitled, The Creed Forgers
detected, etc. Yet seeing they are said to be Atte^ted by the Eight Priests
aforesaid, and Affirmed by George Keith* Exactly to Agree with the Books out of
which they are taken, as Cited in the Margent* We therefore have examined these
following, and find he is mistaken, and so are his Brethren, the eight Priests
aforesaid, as those that will examine his 4 th, 6 th, 20 th, 21 st. Quotations
may find; but we know, as to G. K. it^s not the first false Affirmation he has
made, both before and SINCE his Ordination, and to gratify his new Brethren;
and to show his Enmity, is licking up, and casting forth again, those things
against us, many of which were ca^t upon us before ever he was called a Quaker,
although he was about ^0 Years or more amongst us, and has not yet granted
that he was Err^^^ous in ANY of the Articles of Faith, commonly called, the
Simpliciter Credenda; for he 'saith in his Antichrists and (...), p. 43. I know
^o Principles I now hold, Antichris^. And Sadd. p. 43.
but I am able to prove, I have ne^d them EVER SINCE I came among the People
called Quakers, as to^ching ^ll the Articles of Faith, commonly called the
Simpliciter Credend^ -- And indeed the GREATEST Mistakes that I find I have
been under, were my misunderstanding these places of Scripture, Matthew. 28.19.
and 1 Cor. 11.26. Ibid. p. 42
For, says he, I remain Constant to my FORMER Principles, Retract P. 41.
with respect to these great Doctrines of the Christian Faith.

I do therefore, says G. K. make this Solemn Appeal to the more Sober, Serious
Appeal, P. 6, 7.
Impartial and Judicious People, to whose hands this may come, whether cotton
Mather is not extremely uncharitable, and posessed with a spirit of Prejudice,
and envious Zeal (to use R. Baxter's Phrase) against the Quakers in General,
and me (G. K.) in Particular, as guilty of manifold Heresies, Blasphemies, and
strong Delusions, to the rendering US no Christians in the lowest Degree or
Rank (while I suppose he has some Charity to some in the Church of Rome,
called Papists; and to Lutherans, Arminians, and diverse others that differ
widely from him) yet agree in the aforesaid Fundamentals, when we hold the SAME
FUNDAMENTALS of Christian Doctrine and Faith, notwith^tanding C. M^ther's
strong Ass^^erations against us, as if we denied almost all, or most of the
Fundamental Articles of the Christian and Protestant Faith* yet he shall NEVER
be able to prove it, That we are guilty o^ this his so extremely RASH and
Uncharitable Charge; either as in respect of the BODY of that People, called in
Scorn Quakers, or in respect of ANY PARTICULAR Writers or Publishers of our
Doctrines, and Principles, and Preachers amongst us. -- and it suffices me,
and I hope, does to many others, Ibid. p. 7.
that according to the best knowledge I have of the People called Quakers, and
those most generally owned by them, as Preachers, and P^blishers of their
Faith, of unq^estioned esteem amongst them, and worthy of double Honor, AS
MANY SUCH THERE ARE; I know None that are guilty of any one o^ such Heresies
and Blasphemies, as he accuses them -- And I think I should know, and do know,
those called Quakers, and their Principles, Writ. 1^92.
-- having been Conversant with them in P^blick Meetings, as well as in private
Discourses, with the most noted and esteemed among them for about Twenty Eight
Years put, and that in many Places of the World, in EUROPE, and for these
diverse ^ears in AMERICA.

And now ^oncernig INFALLIBILITY.
We affirm, P. 7.
said G. K. That the Spirit of God in us* and all Believers, in every Discovery
it gives, i^ Infallible; yet we have never judged Our se^^es absolutely
Infallible; nor did (...) place o^ fix an absolute Infallibility upon ANY Man
-- but on the contrary, Truth's Defe^^e. p. 65.
that the Dictates and Leadings of God's Spirit in ^s, are ^nfallible, and have
a direct tendency to Lead, Guide, and Move us Infallibly.

And if G. K. now thinks it is a vile monstrous Error for any to speak and write
from God and Christ, Immediately and Infallibly, and that those that have only
gotten the words, and have not the Spirit of God and Christ, are nor under the
Curse, and in another Spirit than the Apostles were in, let him.

And if he does not, Why does he quote G. F. and esteem it a vile Error, See
Serious Call.
for his saying, viz. And Thou and You, all that Speak and Write, and not from
God Immediately and Infallibly, as the Apostles did, and Prophe^s and Christ;
but ONLY have gotten the words: You are all under the ^^rse, in another Spirit,
Ravened from the Spirit that was in the Apostles.

Note. G. K. did whilst among the Quakers, vindicate these very Pers^ns, in the
same Doctrines which he n^w calls Vile Errors; and thereby re^ders himself
Ins^cere, in Pretending to be ign^rant of them,
If this be a vile and monstrous Error, will and does he Assert the contrary,
viz. That all that only have gotten the Words, but are in another Spirit, than
Christ, the Prophets and Apostles were in, do all Write and Speak from God
Immediately and Infallibly, and are not under the Curse, nor ravened from the
Spirit that was in the Apostles: If so, and this be now his Doctrine, he is
changed from what he was when a Quaker, when he Vindicated their Doctrines in
the Name of the Lord; and when he held, as the Quakers ^^ill do, all the
Doctrines and Princ^^^es of the Christian Faith.

Concerning the Scriptures.
' Geo, ^ox says, as quoted, The Scriptures are not Infallible no^ Divine, but
H^mane. Note, But there are no such words in the Place Cited, although it is
elsewhere, notwithstanding the Attestation of the three Doctors, and (...)
M^^^ers of Art, and Rectors, and G. K^s Affirmation to the T^^th as Cited:
However hear G. K.

I Answer, That not only th^^ Old Testament, but even the Writings or Letter of
the New Testament, G. K's (...) De^^^e, P. ^3.
may be called a Killing Letter to those that ^emain alienated from the Spirit
that quickens, even as Origin has formerly Taught, in his Commentary of (...).
Not only (says he) in the Old Testament is found the Killing Letter; there is
also in the New Testament the Letter which Kills him who does not Spiritually
attend unto the things which are spoken. Now if any go from the Spirit, that
only makes the true Gospel Administration, and set up the Letter or Writing of
the Apos^les, in the roem of the same these Writings of the Apo^^les do
eventually become a killing Letter, no less than that of the Law, and can no
more give Li^e, o^ make Perfect, than the outward Law could. Ibid. 59.
--

The Translations o^ the Scripture (the which Translations are commonly called
Scripture) have diverse Addions, 54.
which Men have added without any pretense to Divine Inspiration. 49.
-- The Letter or External Form of the Writing is not properly the Word of God.
47.
-- By the Word of God in the Scriptures, is not unders^ood the Letter, but
Christ. Thus far G. K.

'And will he now say, Only the bare Writing or Characters, co^si^^ing of Ink
and Paper, is properly the Word of God, and are Infallible, Divine, and not
Humane? I^ G. K. will now so assert, let him.

Concerning Christ's Coming to Judgment Is quoted G. W. as follows.
Call.
What is the Glory of the Father, in which Christ's Coming is? Is it visible to
the carnal Eye, and where is that Coming to be? Is it now to be looked for
outwardly? G. K. says,

G K 's (...) Co^ P. 16.
I do serious^y and truly tell thee, as I faithfully believe that Christ did
locally Ascend upwards into the Heavens, whence also he shall Descend at the
time of the Restitution of all things.

And if G. K. has Retracted this, the Quakers see no cause to Retract, nor yet
to affirm that Christ's Coming is Visible to the carnal Eye.

Concerning Heaven and Hell.
There is none have a Glory and Heaven, but within them: And in Answer to this,
and what W. Penn says, Call.
he^r G. K. says,

Note, if every Regenerate Man is in Heaven, Rector Cor. P. 14.
then he has a Heaven wit^in him, or has a Peace and Joy in him, from Christ.
This is no great Ridd^e nor Paradox to the least Child of the New Jerusalem;
P^^l indeed was before in Heaven, and so is every Regenera^^ (...) Present.

Concerning doing Servile Work on the Lord's Day and the Moral Law.
We might (...) G. K. ^^ought (...) and express Scripture, and proved by plain
and express Scripture, and in express Scripture Terms, that the doing of any
Servile Work on the 1st D^y of the Week, called here the Lord's Day, is forbid;
and by express Scripture, proves the 1st Day of the Week* and none of the other
Days, is called the Lord's Day, and that Christ is not the Life of a Christian,
or the true Christians Life and does by express Scripture Terms, prove that
it^s an Article of Faith or Doctrine, in common to be believed* but he may
expect some Quotations to that Head; and seeing in this Sheet use is made of a
Quotation, out of Appeal, as it is said, out of a Quakers Book concerning the
Church of England's Ministry, we refer the Reader to a Sheet, Entitled, Mr.
Geo. Keith's Account of a National Church, and the Ministry of the Church of
England; and to the Animadversions thereon; and also to the Book, entitled,
The Portraiture of Mr. Geo. Keith, wherein it does appear, what Account G. K
gives ^^^erning the Ministry of the Church of England, and the Dissenting
Ministry; and let him now, if he will, own or deny them to be Heretical and
Antich^istian, so far as they reflect upon the Persons of our Opposers, and
most Heretical.

From the foregoing and following Quotations it will appear, what G. K's Belief
was, and the Quakers is concerning the Ten Articles.

1st Concerning Infallibility G. K. says,
G. K's T^^t^'s De^^ce P, 64.
How (...) this Conseq^e^ce is, I leave unto sober Men to Judge; as to Conclude*
because Men are fallible, that therefore the (...) Light of God's Spirit in Men
is ^allible (...) not Peter Fallible in some (...)* Did not he fail sorely when
he denied his (...) it therefore follow that the Dictate o^ Light of God's
Spirit in him was Fallib^e?

To say that they have no Infallible Spirit, the plain English of which is*
that the Spirit of God, and God himself, is Fallible; thus says G. K. in his
Pres^. and In^. Visible Churches, P. ^7.

Concerning the Holy Scriptures, and their being the Only Rule of Faith and
Practice, or to try Spirits, etc. G. K. says.
Its no Repugnancy, that one and the same thing he Superior and Inferior in
differe^^ ^espects, ^^uth's Defense, P. 65.
and as it respects different Subjects. But there is no necessity to
understand the Dictate and Light of God's Spirit in diverse Men to be Superior
and Inferior, when it Examines and is Examined, for one equal may be a Measure
or ^^le to another; yea, one thing may be said to ^e a Rule unto it self,
according to that common Maxim or Principle, Linea rec^a est n^rma (...)
Obliqui, i. e. A right Line is a Rule of it self, and also of that which is
Crooked -- The Power of God is the Rule -- For none know truly the S^^iptures, ^
but they who know the Power of God; and therefore that Power which is Life,
Light and spirit, is the more (...) and Orginal Rule.

Concerning the Trinity, G. K. says.
G. K's (...) App. P. 2.
The only Exception we have, ^is against that Unscriptural Term or Phrase of
Three Persons, or a Trin^^y of Persons.

G. K 's (...), P. 5^.
And therefore let all Men know, to whose hand this may come. That the People
called Quakers never denied, but on the contrary f^ithfully be^ieved, and do
Still faithfully believe, (...) is Recorded, in the holy Scriptures, of that
great Mystery; to wit, That God is One, and that the F^ther* the Son, and the
Holy Gho^t, is that One Only True and Living God, the Creator and Upholder of
all.

Ibid. P. ^8.
Concerning Christ and his Blood.
G. K. says, The Lord Jesus Christ, whom the Apostles pre^ched, that died for
our Sins, and rose again for our Justification, is ascended and gone into
Heaven, is (...) alone Son of God, (...) that his Body was Cr^cified* and
Buried, did not see Corruption, that the People called Quakers own.

^
G. K. such further ^^l^grant neither our Souls nor our (...) Heaven no^
Redemption, as Meri^ (...) seeing God has (...) so ^ear as to (...) as the
blood of his dear Son (...) may (...) to have some Dignity (...) which is to
say (...), otherwise God would never have given so great Ransom for them, in
the Souls of Men, in respect of their Nature and Being, had not been of great
Value^ which is all I understand by the word^ Me^it, as used by any of us.

G. K 's (...), 180.
Concerning Baptism and the Lord's Supper.
G. K. says, o^ their Two Sacraments, called Baptism and the Supper: (...) for
the (...) or Word Sacrament, it is no where to be found in all the English
Trans^^tions of the Bible, received among Protestants; neither is there any
W^^d either in the Hebrew or Greek, that does (...) answer unto it, unless they
will Translate the Greek Word that signifies Mystery, to signify a Sacrament;
as the old Latin has it in E^h. 5.^2. Loc est ^^^num Sacramentum, i. e. This
is a great Sacrament: For which our English Trans^^t^on (...) more property*
This is a great Myst^^y. But if Sacrament signify Mystery, then the^e must be
^o many Sacraments as (...).

As for Inf^^^s Baptism* p. 1^1.
and (...) a Child of Eight D^ys or more or less, on the ^o^e he^d, and call it
Baptism, it has (...) in all the Scripture, neither of Pr^ce^t no^ (...); as
will easily appear, by considering the places of Script^re, they cite 10.1^ --
^s (...). 9.10. to 22 -- Genesis 17.9. -- we find neither (...) nor Practice in
all the Scripture, nor was the Practice of Baptizing Infants in use for an
Hundred Years and more after the Apostles days, among Professors of
Christianity.

And (...) for W^t^^-Baptism in General, Ibid. P. 1^4.
We say^ It did only pro^^rly belong to John^s Mini^^^y and Dispensation, and
is Expressly (...) from the Baptism of Christ, both by (...) and also by Christ
himself -- And i^ any were (...) up by the Lord, as John was* and could prove
and instruct their being sent to Baptize with Wa^er, as he was; these, to whom
they should be sent, ought gladly to Receiv^^; but to (...) by BARE IMITATION
(...) pretended Call, which they CANNOT PROVE to be either Mediate or
Immediate, is great Presumption, yea, Superstition; and to call that a Command
of God: which he has given them no Command to Practice; is to set up the
Precepts of Men in the Room of God^s Commandments, as the Pharisees did o^ old,
N. E.
and is a taking of his Name in vain; for which he will not hold them Ga^l^less.
And they can never prove, by all their Art and S^ill, that Water Baptism is
Command (...) by Christ, N. E.
Mat. 2^.18, 19. For all God^s Commands and Precepts, Especially of Public
Institution, relating to the Church, are Express in so many express Words, and
are not left to be gathered by uncertain and doubtful Consequences.

P. 185.
When God sent John to Baptize with Water, Water was expressed; but in the
Apostle's Commission to Baptize, no mention is made of Water, nor no words of
Institution commanded to be used.

P. 187.
We grant that Christ had an outward Supper with his Disciples, when he did eat
the Paschal Lamb with them; and this was a real Supper, and not like that which
ye now use, that is neither Substantial Supper nor Dinner, being only a little
Crumb of Bread, scarce so big as a ^ut; and a Spoonful of Wine, or two, which
has little outward Substance, and no Inward and Spiritual Signification unto
you -- your Supper is a mere Shadow, and none of Christ^s Supper, nor of hi^
Institution. With much more.

Concerning the Resurrection.
G. K's (...), P. 9.
In the said Sacet it^s said, They (that is the, Quakers) deny the Resurrection
of the Body after Death.

G. K. says, By W. Penn's words, it is clear to pro^^ the contrary, of a
Carnal Resurrection.

G. K. also says to this charge, That they (i. e. the Quakers) Deny the
Resurrection of the Dead.

Presb. and I.d. visib. C^rr^hes. P. ^29.^^8.
This is also a most false Charge, which they can never prove: But beause we
deny their Carnal Conceptions of the Resurrection, and hold ^^ to Scripture
words, which is most safe, therefore they have so belyed us.

'And for the more Satisfaction of the Reader, I refer him to a little Book,
called The Principles of Truth, published by some noted Men of the Quakers; in
which Book it is expressly ^ffirmed, That ^^ (to wit, the Quakers) believe, That
the same body which is laid down* shall be Rised up at the Resurrection of the
Dead, as much as a Natural Body can be the same with a Spiritual Body, or an
Earthly Body can be the same with a Heavenly Body, according to the Scriptures
Testimony; It is (...) Natural, but raised* Spiritual; and the Glory of the
Heavenly is one, and the Glory of the Earthly is another; and this may satisfy
any sober Inquirer. And Paul, writing concerning the Resurrection of the Dead,
says, That is not first which ^s Spiritual, but that which is Natural (or.
Animal, and afterward that which is Spiritual) 1 Cor. 15.^6. And verse. 49. As
we have born the Image of the Earthly; we shall hear the I^^ge of the Heavenly.

Concerning that called the Sabbath.
The Posts. also says, (...), the Quakers, S^r. Call.
do allow doing Servile Work on the Lord's Day:

G. K. says, Pres^^ and (...) ^hurche^. p. 192.194.
Concerning that ye call your Christian Sabbath, which ye say is the first Day
of the Week. -- but ye bring no sober proof for any such Charge, and the
Scriptures ye c^te say no such thing, as Gen 2.2, 2. Rev. 1.10. E^^^. 20.8, 10.
Mat. 5.17. For that outward Sabbath, that was enjoined unto them was a Sign and
Figure. -- And when the pure G^^pel and Christian Dispensation did take place
(...) these Figurative and Shadowy Sabbaths were changed to the Substance, and
that Substance or Body is Christ, according to Col. 2.17. With much more on
this Head.

And now, hear G K. farther, in his Preface to his Serious Appeal.

Concerning the Quakers.
(...) have opportunity, they may see the Christianity of the Quakers, and G.
Keith also, (...) Quaker.
and ^nquire if ever they (...), heard or read o^ any M^n that (...) done like
him, that prete^^ed to be so many Years sound, as to the Fundamentals of
Christianity, and all the Doctrines of the Christian Religion, and that has
made so b^ld (...) Name of the Lord, and pretended to such Zeal and Co^cern ^or
God, to c^n^rad^ct himself, and feignedly to say, He judges it his (...) from
true (...), and out of real Love to Truth, to say and unsay, and ^o confidently
Assert he does (...) and hum^ly; Can you think this is a Teacher sent or called
of Go^, commisionated by Christ, g^ided by his Spirit, and fit to Follow, or to
Pre^ch up that Dispensation, of which it^ said, every Man shall speak the Truth
to his N^gh^^^r^ and ^are the so called (...), and (...), and those that (...)
him, to be commended ^or their W^sdom? And do they thereby (...) they have ^re
in, or are guided ^y, the Wisdom ^f God and his Holy Spirit (by which so many
as are the Sons of God are ^ed) (...) the^r ^oyning with his Man? h^s hoped,
(...) that ^ollow (...) will duly and well consider these things, you will not
(...) ounce him, but consider that his evil Works, and those that Join with him
therein, ought to beforsaken, and that it will be more for your Profit* and tend
more to your Inward Peace and Christian Reputation, to hearken to the Voice of
Christ in your own Hearts, and to mind that Light by which all things that are
reproved are made manifest, and ^e^ieve in him who said, I am the Light of the
World, and exhorted to earn ^f him, who will teach you ^reely; and no longer to
follow (...) and such Preachers, if you would be Christia^^ (...) and then it is
ho^ed you will acknowledge, viz as G. K. says, p. 230. to the P^esb^ and (...)
Churches viz of New England. (...) by what is herein, and what G. K. says, P.
15. of his Exact. (...). and Preface ^^ere^^, whether he has not proved
himself an Apostate, a great Hyp^crite, stra^ Mad, and Crazed in his
Understanding.


It had been more Manly and seemingly Christian, (for G. K. and his Abettors)
or any others of their Sect or Society, Fairly to have stated the Quakers
Principles, and then to have refuted them by the best or strongest Arguments
they could find: But this none of the^ have done [and he truly has said, They
never can] nor, says he, did I ever see to this day, any one Writer, that did
write against the Quakers, that did fairly state their Principles, but,
miserably belyed and abused them, by either affirming things to be their
Principles which were not, or by so unfairly Representing and Wresting the
words of our Honest Friends, by their Addings and Diminishings, that they could
not at all acknowledge them as such; all which is a manifest Evidence of the
Weakness and Badness of their Cause, as well as of that evil Conscience that is
in them; when they use such unlawful ways and means to defend themselves, or to
oppugn others.

Published on Behalf of the People called Quakers, by some of them.
