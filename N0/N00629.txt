WHereas it has pleased Almighty God to bless the Inhabitants of this (...)
Plenty of Corn and Provisions. And whereas Major William Merit, (...)ayor of
the City of New York, on behalf of ^he said City, has Represented unto me this
day in Council, That by reason of the great Quantties of Flower, Bread and Corn
exp^^ted to the West Indies and Boston, and the Bakers neglect of baking Bread
for the use of the Inhabitants, they are (...) much aggrieved. I have
therefore, by and with the Advice of his Majesty's Council for this P^ovince,
thought fit to Prohibit the Exportation of Flower, Bread, Wheat, or any other
Grain, u^til the first of August next ensuing. And all Officers of his
Majesty's Custom-house, and others concerned, are to take Notice hereof
accordingly, as they will answer the Contrary at their Perl.

Year of ^he Reign of our Sovereign Lord WILLIAM the Third, King of England,
Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc. Annoque Domini 1696.
