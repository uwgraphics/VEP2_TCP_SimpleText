DUBARTAS.
There, with long bloody Hair, a Blazing Star
Threatens the World with Famine, Plague and War:
To Princes, death; to Kingdoms many crosses:
To all Estates, Inevitable Losses:
To Heardmen, Rott: to Plow-men hapless seasons:
To Sailors, Storms: to Cities, civil Treasons.
AN ASTRONOMICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE LATE COMET, As it appeared in New England.
1. THis Comet is no sublimary Meteor or sulphurous Exhalation, but a
Celestial Luminary, moving in the st^rry Heavens.

The Truth hereof may be demonstrated, 1 By the vast Dimensions of it is body.
Some Comets have been observed by Astronomers to be half as big as the Mo^n,
some bigger then the Moon, yea some bigger then the Earth. The exact Dimensions
of this Comet, I may not presume to determine, but it seems not to be of the
smallest size. Now it is not easy to imagine how the Earth should afford matter
for a M^^eor of such a huge magnitude, except we grant the greater part of the
lower World to be turned into an exhalation. 2. By the smalness of it is
Parallax. The Parallax is the Distance between the true place of a Planet and
the apparent. The lower and nearer any Planet is to the Earth, it has the
greater Parallax. The Moon's Parallax in her Perige, is one d^gree and six
minutes. I could not by my Observation discern that this Comet had any
considerable Parallax. 3. By it is large ci^cular mo^ion. If it had moved in the
upper Region of the Air, it might have finished the whole visible arch of i^'s
C^^cle in a few hours: but we saw it perform it is proper motion with great
constancy in a very large C^rcl^, such as the air is not capable of. 4 By i^'s
long auration and continu^n^e. Had it been a Sulphurous V^por kindled in the
Air; it might have been consumed in a short time; as other fiery Meteors are:
but this continued about three months. 5 By it is Visibility to all Countries
and Nations. We already hear that this C^met was seen at Virginia, (...) St
Martha* Car^^ge^^ and Barba^os* and no d^ubt but it was visible to the whole
habitable World. But the highest region of the Air is accoun^ed ^ot ^uch above
fifty English ^^les from the Earth, and had this (...) been to hig^e^, ^t had
been impossible that other (...) and (...) so far distant, should have beh^ld
it. (...) this Comet was created in the beginning of the World together with
the rest of the Sta^s, and has been hidden in the height and profundity of the
H^^vens, and at a certain time descending toward the Eart^, becomes Visible and
Signal to the World, I leave free to after-disquisition.

II. This Comet is no^ ^n Opake Body, like the Moon and other of the Planets,
but Transparent and Pellucid, the Sun Shining through i^.

The Moon is enlightened on that part only which is next the Sun, and like a
looking glass she reflects the solar Beams, which are cast upon her: but the
Sun erradiates the Comet and shines through it as through a Transparent Gem^^
and illustrates a long tract in the Heavens beyond it. As the Moon, being a
thick and dark Body, casts a dark shadow from the Sun, so the Comet being a
clear and D^aphan^us Body transmits the light and casts a bright and shining
stream from the S^n; which alters and varies according to the diverse aspect of
the Sun.

III. The Coma or Blazing Stream that iss^es from the Comet, is no real fl^me,
but the Irr^diation and Resplendence of the Sun through the Tra^sparent and
Pelluci^ Body of the Comet.

A Comet is denominated from it is Coma or Bush^ lock for the Stream has some
resemblance of a lock of hair. Now this Stream is not the flagrancy of the
Comet, but the Beams of the Sun shining through the Diaphanous and Tr(...) of
the Comet; as may be argued and demonstrated, 1. By it is site and posi^^^n,
which is always in opposition to the Sun. Had it been a natu^al flame, arising
from it is flagr^nt (...), it would have constantly moved upward, as the flame
of a Lamp or Torch; unless it had broken forth by violence: but this streaming
was sometimes upward, sometimes somewhat downwa^^, sometimes westward,
sometimes northward, so^etimes eastward, according to the position of the Sun:
neither can I imagine that any violence caused it so to move. 2. By the dive^se
form and ^^gure of the stream ^c^ording to the diverse (...) of the Sun. One
while it was like a board, another while like a tail. 3. B^ the (...)
^^m^ns^o^s of the Stream. It was sometimes (...) sometimes shorter, sometimes
broad, sometimes narrower, according as the Comet was nearer or further from
the Ear^h. 4 B(...) q^ality and color of the stre^m. I^ was sometimes bright
and radiant, at other (...) and faint, according to the apparent radiation of
the Sun and the (...) d^st^nce from us. 5. By it is du^ation. Had it been a real
and natural flame, it is difficult to understand how the head of the C^met
could have supplied it with food and fuel for so many months together. Obj, If
the Stream be an irradiation of the Sun, how comes it to be conspicuous and
visible to us? The Sun-beame^ p^ssing through the etherial Heavens are not in
themselves visible, neither do they terminate our sight. Answ. The only reason
thereof (that I can yet learn) is the Refraction and Reverberation of the
Sunbeams, as they pass through the ^ome' (...)* whereby they are so
congregated and so nearly united, as that they terminate the sight and become
conspicuous in the Heavens. I have read of a certain semi-transparent Gemme,
called the Heliotrope, that if it be put in o^ fair water, opposed to the
beams of the ^un, it does change it is be^mes, and by the repercussion of the
A(...), seems to shadow the clearness of it is rays, and (...) sanguineous
color in the Air, as if the Sun by the interposition of the body of the Moon,
did suffer an ecliptic darkness.

IV. This Comet is not a new fixed Star, but a Planetick or Erratick Body,
wandering up and down in the etherial firmament under the fixed stars.

Some learned Astronomers distinguish these more noble and celestial Phenomenon
or Appearances into Fixed and E^ratick. Several new Stars have appeared which
are fixed, i. e. they keep the same place in the Heaven, and the same d^stance
from the fixe^ Stars. One in O^ssi^^ei^ Anno 1572. which continued a year and
four months. Another in Antinous: another in the Gira^e of Anaromeda, another
in the Whale, another in the Breast of the Swan, which continued many years. But
this Comet was (...) (as Jude speaks) a wandering Star, which kept not the same
place in the Heavens, nor the same distance from the fixed Stars.

V. This Comet appeared first in the Constellation of the Raven, from whence it
descended and crossing the Tropic of Capricorn and some part of Hydra, it went
southward until it arrived at the main topsaile of the ship: then it began to
return, and going through the belly of Canis major, it again crossed the
Tropic of Capricorn, and p^ssi^g through the middle of the Hare, it crossed
the river Eridanus and the Equinoctial, and entered into the mouth of the Whale,
and going through his head, it crossed the Ecliptic and so passed up between
Aries and Linum sep^entrionale.

Some took notice of this Comet in the begin^ing of Nov^mber, and indeed it had
passed through the middle of the Aste^ism of Co^^us, (as I gather from it is
following motions) before I saw it. Dec. 5 early in the morning it seemed to me
to be very near the Southern Tropic, about 3 degrees southward of the Ravens
hill having longit. Lib. 4. Dec. 8 early in the morning I saw it in some part
of Hydra; in Virgo 28. lat. S. 30 gr. The stream overshadowing a small star in
Hydra, that was near. D^c. 1^. some observed it among the stars that are in the
mainmast of Argo Navis: where it had longit. Leo 23. Lat. S. 45. Dec. 17. It
was seen amongst the stellae informs, which are behind C^^nis m^jor: where it
was apprehended to have longit. Leo. 2. lat. S. 50. Dec. 18. The (...) came to
Sirius, i. e. the great Dog, and passed through his belly. That night I saw it
in Cancer 13. lat. S. 48. Dec. 19. It ascended from C^nis major and crossing
the southern Tropic it arrived at Le^us, i. e. the Hare. That night I saw it
pass over the more nor^hern Star in the Hare's hinder legs: being in Gemini 24.
lat. S. 44. Dec. 23. I saw it as I supposed in Taur. 14. lat. S. 19. De^. 24. I
apprehended it to be in the Equinoctial which it crossed in the 44 th gr.
entering into the mouth of Balaena: hav^ng longit Iaur. 12.30. lat. S 17. Dec.
25. In T^ur. 11.30. lat. S. 14. D^c. 28, I saw it in a right line between two
Stars in the head of the Whale, almost in the middle between them: in Taur.
4.15. Lat. S. 7.15. Dec. 29 I saw it very near to another Star in the head of
the Wha^e: in Taur. 3. lat. S. 6. Jan. 3 It crossed the Ecliptic in Aries
28.30. Jan. 16. it came to A^^es 26. lat. N. 3. Jan. 24. Aries 25. lat. N. 4.
Jan. 31. Aries 25. lat. N. 5.30. Feb. 4. Aries 25. lat. N. 6.15. Since that I
saw it not, nor any man else, that I hear of* If in these observations I have
not attained that ^^curateness which the Reader desires my want of (...)
Instruments may bespeak his indulgence therein.

VI. This Comet at it is first appearance was Oriental and Matutine, afterward
it ^ecame Occidental (...) Vespertine.

At first it appeared early in the morning before the rising of the Sun, and
then every day role sooner then other, (withal changing it is Az^^^^^ or point
of the Compass in it is rising) until it appear^d in the evening, as soon as
daylight was ended.

VI (...) Comet at first moved sl^wly, ben more (...) came to (...) which time
it (...) decreased in (...) motion: toward the (...) of i^'s appari^ion, it
has moved (...) sl^w^y.

From D^c. 5 ^h. to the 8 (which was the time between ^y first and second
observation) the Comets apparent moti^n ^n it'^, p^oper line upon the (...),
was abo^^ 2 d^grees and a half in a day one day with another D^c. 17. it was
observed by ^ome to move about 13. degrees. Dec. 18 it m^ved 5, or 16 a (...).
Dec. 19 it moved about 13 (...). [I cannot precisely determine it is (...)
motion, especially when it was so exceeding swift, because I know not certainly
the hour of one night, when these observations were mad^.] From D^c. 25, to 29
it moved 2 degrees and half in a day, one day with another. Dec. 29. 2 (...).
30. 1 degr. and half D^c. 31. 1 degr. In the beginning of (...). it moved near
1 degr. in a day: but toward the latter end, not one degrees. in several days.
From I^n. 5 ^^ to Fe^. 4 th according to my observation it gained scarce 7 deg^.

VIII This Comet was continually Re^rograede in it is motion, only toward the
latter end if it is apparit^^n, it becam^ Stationar^.

This Comet from the first time, it was taken notice of, until the latter end
of Ian. in it is proper motion went contrary to the seri^* and (...) of the
signe^, viz. from Libra to V^^go and so backwa^d to Arie^: But in the latter
end of I^nua^y and in the beginning of Feb^u^ry it kept in the same degree of
longi^ude, only it altered it^s latitude.

IX T^is Comet has moved constantly almost in a right line, or in a great
Circl^, (...) to the greatest circle of the celestial Sph^re^ but toward it is
disappearing, it has d^flected a little and become elliptic^ll.

This may be demonst^^ted by the Cel^st^al Glob^. Depress the Southern Pole 61
degr. (which is the complement of the Comet's greatest declination,) and you
may find almost all the forementioned observations concerning the Comets place
to fall just upon the Horizon of the Globe: but toward the latter end, you
shall find the Cometicall line to recede a little from a true circle.

X. The proper Circle of the Comets motion is Eccentrical, i e. it has a
center diverse from the center of the world.

This is evident 1 By the dive^si^y of it is Latitud^, which was sometimes
southern, and sometimes northe^n. 2 By the inequality of it is appa^ent motion,
which was sometimes swift and sometimes slow. 3 By the diversity of it is
distance from the earth, which was sometimes great^^, and sometimes less.

XI. T^is Comet has ascended in Meridian Altitude above 44 degr. For it is
lowest meridian altitude with us, was 18 degr. and 40 minutes, and it is
highest, 63 degr. and 15 min.

XII. The Cometical line descended to 29 degr. of Southern declination.

XIII. The Comet's Southern Limit of Latitude was 50 degr.

XIV. The apparent motion of the Comet was anomalous and unequal, but it is
motion in it is proper Orb or Circle, was very near equal and un^form.

That it is apparent motion was unequal and irregular is manifest by it is
Velocity or swiftnes one while, it is mediocrity another while, and it is tardi^y
or slowness toward the latter end. The cause of which anomaly and inequality,
was the Comet's Eccentricity. That the Comet's motion in it is proper orb or
circle* was very near equal and uniform, may be demonstrated by the equality of
it is diurnal motion in equal distances from it is perige. For instance, I find
on the 5 th of December and on the 25 th, the Comet was equally distant from
it is Perige, and that then it is apparent motion was equal, viz. 2 degrees and a
half in a day: and therefore it is true motion in reference to it is own proper
center was very near equal and regular.

XV. The Comet seemed to be in it is Perige, or nearest to the Earth, when it
was in the belly of Canis major, which was sometime on the 18 th of December.

The Perige is that point of the Cometical circle which is nearest to the
earth. The Apoge is the point farthest distant from the earth. That the Comet
was in it is Perige at the time and in the place forementioned may be argued. 1
From the swiftness of it is apparent motion on that day. All the Planets are
slow in their Apoge and swift in their Perige. This Comet was apprehended to
move the most swiftly on that day. ^. from the Equality of it is apparent m^tion
in equal distances from thence: An instance whereof I gave before. 3* From the
d^stance of the place assig^^d, (viz. the middle of the belly of S^rius) to the
place of the C^m^t's dis^ppearing^ In the Cometical line the distance is about
90 (...). Now according to the Theory and doctrine of Com^^^* it was never
observed that any Comet from the point of it is swift^st motion* ever ran bey^nd
the fourth part of a circle, which is 90 degrees. N. B. On the self same day (
^^z. the 18 th of December) the Sun was also in his Perige.

XVI. Sinc^ December 5 th, the Comet has proceeded in it is proper curricle
upon the celestial Sphere, 153. degrees: and I suppose in all, since it is first
apparition, 180. degrees.

XVII. The cometical circle seems to include and encompass the Earth.

This may be Argued 1. From the length and (...) of the visible and apparent
Arch of the ^on^etual circle* which was very near to, if not a true s^micircl^.
2. From the Dur^^ion and long (...) of it is Apparition, which was about three
months.

XVIII. (...) real magnitude of the Comet was constan^^y (...) and the same,
but it is apparent (...) and Diverse.

At it is first appearance it seemed but sm^ll, at length it appeared far
grea^^^, sometime it seemed to be very near half as big as the Moon: after
that it decreased successively, till at last it appeared like a cloudy star.
The Reason whereof is evid^nt; at it is first appearance it was very high in the
Heavens, and therefore it is diameter seemed less: afterwa^d it descend^d lower
and nearer to the earth, and then it is ^^^meter increased at (...) went up
(...) and was removed further from our sight, and then it is (...) together with
the (...) was dimin^sh^d, until at last it disappeared and vanish^d out of
sight.

XIX The ^rue color and spl^ndor of the C^met was always one and the same,
but it is apparent color w^^ v^rious and diverse.

At first appearance it is color was (...) and obscur^: afterward ^right (...),
at length it grew very obscur^ and (...) l^ke a cloudy star. In the West Indies
it appeared fiery, red and dreadful.

XX The Coma or S^ream that came from the head of the Comet, wa^ a^wayes cast
into that part, which was diametrical^y ^pposite to the sun.

When the Comet's irradiation was from the southe^st, it is streaming was toward
the nor^hwest, when it is irradiation was from S.S E. it is streaming was toward
N. N W. when it is ir^^diation was from the South, it is streaming was toward the
north, when it is irradiation was from S.S.W. it is streaming was toward N.N.E.
when it is irradiation was from the S.W. it is streaming was toward N.E.

XXI. The Comet in respect of it is stream, has been of a diverse figure
according to the diverse aspect of the Sun.

Comets in respect of their figure are distinguished into Barbate, Caudate and
Crinite. A Comet is barbate, when the stream like a beard, goes before the body
of the Comet. Caudate, when the stream like a tail follows the body of ye
Comet. Crinite when the stream goes right up into ^he Heavens and seems like a
hai^y-lock to be wound up about the Comet's head. This Comet, while it was
Oriental, was Barb^t^, the stream going before its body, like a beard. When the
Come^ became Occidental, it was Caudate, the stream following the Comet's body
like a tail. But it could not be properly Crinite, in regard of the greatness
of the Comet's southern latitude at the time of it is opposition with the Sun.

XXII. The stream has appeared of a diverse height, breadth and extent,
according to the diverse position of the Sun, and the Comet's distance from us.

The stream was not always of the same height in the Heavens with the head of
the Comet, but sometimes higher, and sometimes lower. Neither was the
dilatation of the stream always one and the same, but it was sometimes
broader, and sometimes nar^ower. The length and extent of the stream was also
diverse: Dec: 8. It was apprehended to be 38 degr. long. D^c. 17. 20 degr. Dec.
30. 15 d^gr. Jan. 6. 14 degr. I^n. 25. 7 degr Ian. 31. 3 d^gr.

XXIII. This Comet has been vertical to all countries, ha^ lie between 29
degrees of Southern Latitude and 15 degrees of Northern Lati^ude.

The Comet is said to be V^^tical to any people, when the Body of the Comet
passes over their heads. This Comet was vertical to the chief Islands of the
East Indies, as also to Guine^ and to the most of the Southern part of Africa:
likewise to Peru, Brasilia, Gui^na, C^stilia del oro, ^ova Andaluzia, and to
several of the Islands of the West Indie^, as Trinidada, G^anada, Barbados,
Ma^alin^, D^minica and many other.

XXIV. The stream which came from the Comet ha^h turned above and pointed
toward most cou^^ries and Kingdoms in the habitable World.

XXV. This Comet is not evaporated nor dissolved, but it is ascended higher
toward it is Apoge and ^o departed out of ou^ sight.

If the Comet be no vapor but a celestial planetick lumin^^y, moving
constantly in it is Eccentrick orb, and if the stream thereof be no real flame,
but the irradiation of the Sun through the Comet's head, it will necessarily
follow that the Comet is not consumed, dissipated or extinguished, but rather
ascended toward it is Apoge, i. e. the farthest point distant from the Earth,
and so being buried in the deep abyss of the Heavens, becomes inconspicuous to
us.

XXVI. This Comet has followed upon a notable Conjunction of the Superior
Planets, Saturn and Jupiter.

Astronomers observe, that Comets do many times follow a Conjunction of the
Superior Planets. The last Year, October 10 th, was a great Conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter in the 13 th degr. of Sagittarius.

A Brief Theological Application of this strange and notable Appearance in the
Heavens.
I. THE Holy Scriptures, which are the Authentic and unerring Canon of truth,
teach us to look at Comets, as Portentous and Signal of great and notable
Changes.

Joel 2.30, 31. I will show wonders in the Heavens and in the Earth, Blood and
Fire, and Pillars of Smoke. The Sun shall be ^urned into Darkness, and the Moon
into Blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.

Luke 21.25. There shall be signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the
Stars.

Acts 2.19.20. I will show wonders in Heaven above, and sig^^s in the Earth
beneath: Blood, and Fire, and Vapor of Smo^k. The Sun shall be turned into
Darkness and the Moon into Blood before the great and notable day of the Lord
come.

II. The Histories of former Ages, do abundantly testify that Comets have been
many times Herald^ of wrath to a secure and impenitent World.

Take a few Instances.

A little before the Achaick War (as Seneca reports) there appeared a Comet
fiery and ruddy, which cast a clear light, whereby the night was enlightened.

Anno Christi 56. There appeared a Comet. The same Year Claudius died, and
bloody Nero succeeded, who slew his Moth^r, his Wife and his Master Seneca, and
exercised a great deal of cruelty and wickedness.

Anno 323. There were diverse Comets which preceeded the Pestilent He^esie of
Arius.

Anno. 337. A Comet appeared before the death of Constantine the great, and
innumerable evils followed.

Anno 602. A great Comet appeared, which preceded, if not presaged the
slaughter of Mauritius the Emperor, and the Supremacy of the Bishop of Rome.

Anno 675, and 676. There appeared a Comet 3 months, at which time the
Saracens greatly afflicted the Roman Empire.

Anno. 729 Two Comets appeared, and the same year a great Plague invaded the
World.

Anno 814. A terrible Comet appeared before the death of Charles the great.

Anno 1066. A Comet appeared a long time to the whole World: the same Year
England was many ways afflicted by William Duke of Norman^y, and at length
subdued.

Anno 1618. There appeared a great Comet: the same year brake forth the Bloody
Wa^s in G^rmany. Anno 1652. There appeared a Comet at the beginning of Mr.
Cotto^s sickness, and disappeared a few days after his death. The next year
strange and notable changes of state happened in England.

It Is true, some Comets have been thought to presage good to the World, as that
in the days of Augustus before the birth of Christ. [ I intend out that
miracul^us St^r, which appeared to the Magi.] Another before the death of Nero:
Another before the reformation by Wickliff^: Another before the reformation by
Lut^e^: but most commonly they are observed to precede* if not portend great
Calamities.

Anno 79 Upon a Comet followed horrible W^nds, an (...) and Pestilence. When
some shew^d (...) this Comet, fearing it might por^end his death* he answered
mer^ily that this Prod^gie noted not him, but the King of (...). For says he,
(...), but I am b^ld. But not long after, Vespasian died.

III. The Commination of wrath according to Scripture, is to be understood
after a conditional manner, i e. wi^h an implicit reservation for Gods
altering and revoking his threatened dispensation upon repen^ance intervening.

Jer 18.7, 8. At what Instant I shall speak concerning a na^^on and concerning
a Kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it: if that nation
against whom I have pronounced, turn from t^eir Evil, I will repent of the evil
that I though^ to do unto them.

Jer 36.3, 7. It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evil, which I
purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way, that
I may forgive their Iniquity and their Sin. It may be they will present their
supplication before the Lord, and will return every one from his evil way: for
gr^^t ^s the Anger and the Fury, which the Lord has pron^un^ed against this
People.

Jonah 3 10. And G^d saw their works that they turned from their evil w^y, and
G^d repented of the Evil, that he had said (...) he would do unto them, and he
did it not.

IV. This Blazing Star being in conjunction with diverse other awful
Providence and Tokens of Wr^th, calls upon us to awake out of security, and to
bring for^h fruits meet for Repentance.

A Few Instances of some late awful Providence.

1. Earthquakes. About two years ago viz. Ian. 26, and 28^ 1662, 63. The
foundations of the Earth trembled, and some of our houses rock't like a cradle.
6, or 7 times did the Earth shake under us in the space of 2 or 3 days. It was
then thought and said, that these Earthquakes might portend the Lords shaking
the foundations of our Churches and of our civil state.

2. The late removal by Death of some of our eminent Prophets and seers, who
were as eyes unto us in the Wilderness, and the Charets of Israel and the
Horsemen thereof. April. 5 th, 1663, That burning and shining Light, who shone
in the Church of Boston, and gave light to the whole Colony and Country. Mr.
John Norton, a man eminently accomplished, was taken from us, and translated to
an higher Orb. Of whom New England was not worthy.

July 20 1663. That bright and radiant Star, a Star of the first magnitude, Mr.
Samuel Stone, the strength and glory of Connecticut, rested from his labors
and sorrows, and fell a sleep sweetly and placidly in the Lord. A little before
Him, Mr John Miller and Mr. Samuel Newman, faithful, painful and affectionate
Preachers of the Gospel, were also taken from us by death. Thus our Pillars are
cut down, our strongest Stakes plucked up, and our breaches not repaired. Is it
a small thing in our eyes, yt our principal Congregations and Head-townes,
should be so sadly bereaved, as they are at this day?

3. The sad Mildew and Blasting, whereby we have been greatly afflicted the
last Summer, and some of us the Summer before: our principal grain being turned
into an husk and rotteness.

4. Severe Drought this last Summer, which burnt up the Pastures and the latter
growth.

5. Early Frosts, which smote our Indian Corn, and greatly impoverished our
latter harvest.

Unto these and some other no less threatening Visitations* is superadded this
strange and fearful Appearance in the Heavens, which is now seconded by a new
Appearance th^s Spring, concomitant to the translation of our Honored and Aged
Governor, Mr. Joh^ Endicot, from hence to a better World: By all which
doubtless the Lord calls upon New England to awake and to repent.

To this End Consider.

1. What a jealous eye the Lord has upon us, observing how we carry and behave
our selves at such a time as this* Ier. 3.8. And I saw, when for all the
causes, whereby backs^^ding Israel ^o^mitted Adultery, I had put her away, and
given her a bill of Divorce: yet her Treacherous Sister Judah feared not, but
went and played the H^^lo^ also.

2. What the Lord expects and looks for from a people so highly favored and
privileged, and so awfully warned and threatened. Zeph. 3.7. I said surely thou will fear me; thou will receive Instruction: so their dwelling place should
not be cut off; howsoever I punished them.

3. How sadly will the Lord Jesus expostulate with us, if we fall asleep in the
hour of the Passion and Agony of the Gospel. Mat. 26.40. He comes unto the
Disciples and finds them a sleep, and says unto Peter, what could ye not
watch with me one hour? each word is very Emphatical.

4. The danger of being surprised by temptation before we are aware. Lam. 1.9.
She Remembered not her last end, therefore she come down wonderfully: she had no
comforter. Rev. 16.15. Behold I come as a thief. Bl^^^ed is he that watches
and (...) his ^arments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

5. The singular blessing reserved for the vigilant and penitent. H^t. 3.16.
When I heard my b^lly trembled; my lips (...) voice: ^otten^ss entered into my
bones: and I tre^bled in my self, that I might rest in the d^y of trouble.
Luke 21.36. Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may b^ ^ccounted
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
the Son of Man.

To C^nclude: God forbid that any of us, should be (...) wandering Stars,
Eccentrick and Erratick in our motions, as all Seducers and Impostors are: for
whom is reserved the blackness of da^kness for ever. Jude, v.13. but the Lord
grant that we may all bec^me fixed Stars in the new Jerusal^m, which comes
down from God, observing the Heavenly order prescribed in his holy word, and
shining as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, clearly
reflecting that pure and preci^us light, wherewith we are irradiated by the Sun
of Righteousness: and then we may ^ssure ourselves. Christ will still hold us
in his right hand, and not suffer us to be cast down from Heaven, but enable us
to fin^sh our course with joy, and at length translate us into the Kingdom of
the Father, where we shall shine forth as the Sun, and as the brightness of the
firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever. Amen.

FINIS.
