To (...) Highness William Henrick, Prince of Orange, The most Humble Petition
of George Lord Chancellor Jefferies.
Most Humbly Shows,
THat your Petitioner who was once Lord Chancellor of England is now become the
lowest of Your Suppliants, and from the first and chiefest Councellor about the
Throne, a miserable and dejected Captive in the Tower.

I do not presume to justify my integrity, that would be an Arrogance as black
as my Crimes; I confess I am as unworthy to Live as I am unwilling to Dye, and
therefore I Prostrate my self at the Footstool of Your Grace and Clemency,
that Fountain of inexhaustible Goodness, wherein Mercy only can flow upon so
notorious a Delinquent.

To Enumerate my Crimes would be as innumerable as the Enemies I have created
by them, nor will I presume to Profane Your Sacred Ears with so black a
Catalogue, whose precious Minutes are more happily employed in weightier
Affairs of this Nation, the restitution of the Laws and Liberties. I by my base
and precipitate Counsels have endeavored to subvert: what could be more
Pernicious and Destructive to the Fundamental Laws of the Nation than to
Establish a Power of Men to Dispense with them what greater inlet to Popery
than to take off the Penal Laws and Tests? What deeper stroke to the Protestant
Church than to Erect an Ecclesiastical Court of Commissioners to pull down her
Pillars: In all which and many others I (to my shame) I must confess, I have
been all along a principal Councellor and Instrument: if Your Highness Please
to Pardon all these many Crimes, I do Promise to make Restitution by
Discovering some Intreagues of State, which may highly advance Your Highnesses
Interest in this Kingdom.

And Your Petitioner shall ever Pray, etc.

Boston, Printed by S. G. for Samuel Phillips at the West end of the
Townhouse, 1689.
