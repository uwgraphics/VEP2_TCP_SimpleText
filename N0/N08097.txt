A PSALM of THANKSGIVING, Adapted to the SOLEMNITY of EASTER: To be performed
on Sunday, the 30th of March, 1766, at CHRIST-CHURCH, Philadelphia.
I.
IT IS finished, thus the Savior said,
Nor more could add the parting Breath;
Then lowly bowed his sacred Head,
And sunk beneath the Stroke of Death.
Attendant Angels hovering round,
In louder Notes proclaim the Sound;
It Is finished, as by Turns they sung,
High Heaven's aetherial Arch and golden Mansions rung.
II.
Blessed JESUS! all thy Sorrows over,
Thy painful Labors here have End;
And yet thy faithful Saints deplore
Their long lost Master, Father, Friend.
But other Scenes thy Strength await,
A glorious and triumphant State;
GOD's Arm will his Anointed free,
Nor Hell can thee detain, Corruption's Power to see.
III.
Religion learns from thee to shine,
Of purest Light the purest Ray;
Thus chearing with its Warmth divine,
It beams an universal Day.
From Cares that vex, or Joys that tire,
To perfect Bliss shall Man aspire,
And subject to thy boundless Reign,
Exult like thee to live, like thee to rise again.
CHORUS.
From GOD alone our Blessings flow,
By Goodness known to all below;
Our Hearts and Voice to him we raise,
And endless Love repay with endless Praise.
