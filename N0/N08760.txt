A CARD, To the Freeholders and Freemen, of this City and County,
FROM Messrs. Axe and Hammer, and a number of the respectable body of Leather
Aprons, give their Compliments to their Old Friends who have not yet joined
them; and beg they will be Stanch and Hearty in hindering a Lawyer, from
representing this Commercial City. And beg likewise they would remember what
honest Jolt the Cartman said, that he had never got Sixpence by riding Law
books, but many pounds of the Merchants." That it is trade, and not Law, that
supports our Families, as many a Man can testify; and One of their Number in
particular, whom it Cost upwards of L 700 C. D -- k.

THEY present their Compliments to Mr. Hatchway and Bowline, and beg that they
would be sharp in their Observations, lest there should lie a Rock under the
Water, on which they might strike, and be dashed into Pieces. -- take care of
Combinations.

New York, Tradesman's-Hall, January 14, 1769
