Courteous Reader,
THIS is the Twelfth Year that I have in this Way labored for the Benefit --
of Whom? -- of the Public, if you will be so good-natured as to believe it; if
not, even take the naked Truth, 'twas for the Benefit of my own dear self; not
forgetting in the mean time, our gracious Consort and Duchess the peaceful,
quiet, silent Lady Bridget. But whether my Labors have been of any Service to
the Public or not, the Public I must acknowledge has been of Service to me; I
have lived Comfortably by its Benevolent Encouragement; and I hope I shall
always bear a grateful Sense of its continued Favor.

My Adversary I -- n I -- n has indeed made an Attempt to outshine me, by
pretending to penetrate a Year deeper into Futurity; and giving his Readers
gratis in his Almanac for 1743 an Eclipse of the Year 1744, to be beforehand
with me: His Words are, The first Day of April next Year 1744, there will be a
GREAT ECLIPSE of the Sun; it begins about an Hour before Sunset. It being in
the Sign Aries, the House of Mars, and in the 7th. shows Heat, Difference and
Animosities between Persons of the highest Rank and Quality, etc I am very
glad, for the Sake of these Persons of Rank and Quality, that there is no
manner of Truth in this Prediction: They may, if they please, live in Love and
Peace. And I caution his Readers (they are but few, indeed, and so the Matter's
the less) not to give themselves any Trouble about observing this imaginary
Great Eclipse; for they may stare till they are blind without seeing the least
Sign of it. I might, on this Occasion, return Mr. I -- n the Name of Baal's
false Prophet he gave me some Years ago in his Wrath, on Account of my
Predicting his Reconciliation with the Church of Rome, (though he seems now to
have given up that Point) but I think such Language between old Men and
Scholars unbecoming; and I leave him to settle the Affair with the Buyers of
his Alma^ack as well as he can, who perhaps will not take it very kindly, that
he has done what in him lay (by sending them out to gaze at an invisible
Eclipse on the first of April) to make April Fools of them all. His old thread
bare Excuse which he repeats Year after Year about the Weather, That no Man can
be infallible therein, by Reason of the many contrary Causes happening at or
near the same time, and the Unconstancy of the Summer Showers and Gusts, etc.
will hardly serve him in the Affair of Eclipses; and I know not where he will get
another.

I have made no Alteration in my usual Method, except adding the Rising and
Setting of the Planets, and the Lunar Conjunctions. Those who are so disposed,
may thereby very readily learn to know the Planets, and distinguish them from
each other.

I am, dear Reader, Thy obliged Friend, R. SAUNDERS.

The COUNTRY MAN.
Happy the Man whose Wish and Care
A few paternal Acres bound,
Content to breathe his native Air,
In his own Ground.
Whose Herds with Milk, ^^ose Fields with Bread,
Whose Flocks supply him with Attire,
Whose Trees in Summer yield him Shade,
In Winter Fire.
Blessed, who can unconcernedly find
Hours, Days and Years slide soft away,
In Health of Body, Peace of Mind,
Quiet by Day,
Sound Sleep by Night; Study and Ease
Together mixed; sweet Recreation;
And Innocence which most does please
with Meditation.
Thus let me live, unseen, unknown,
Thus unlamented let me die,
Steal from the World, and not a Stone
Tell where I lie.

The Anatomy of Man's Body as governed by the Twelve Constellations.


To know where the Sign is.
First find the Day of the Month, and against the Day you have the Sign or
Place of the Moon in the 5th Column. Then finding the Sign here, it shows the
part of the Body it governs.

The Names and Characters of the Seven Planets.
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna, Dragons Head and Tail

The Five Aspects. Conjunction, Sextile Opposition, Trine, Quartile.

Common Notes for the Year 1744.
Gol^^n Number 16 E^^^t 26 Cycle of the Sun 1^ Dominical Letters AG
Explanation of this ALMANAC.
THE first Column shows the Days of the Month The second shows the Week days,
Sunday Letter this Year being AG.

The third contains the Days observed by the Church, the Aspects of the Planets
and Judgments of the Weather, the Length, Increase and Decrease of Days, the
rising and setting of the seven Stars, etc.

The fourth is the Time of High Water at Phil^delphia. (h) signifies ha^^ a^
(...) after.

The fifth is the Moon's Place.

The sixth is the Sun's rising and setting, th^s understood; Against the second
Day of January you see in the 6th Column these Figures 7 17 5, which show that
the S^n rises that Day 17 Minutes after 7, and sets 17 Minutes before 5. I have
chose to put the Sun's rising and setting for every Day, rather than the
Moon's, because of its constant Use in setting of Clocks and Watches.

In the last Column, with the Changes of the Moon, I have put her rising and
setting every now and then: If you want to know her rising or setting on any
Day between those against which I have set it, the common Rule of three
Quarters of an hour later each Day, will be exact enough to direct People in
their Traveling, which is the common Use that is made of it.

Profitable Observation^ and Notes.
ALL Measures of Longitude are deduced from Barley co^ns: Three Barley co^ns

Without Repentance none to Heaven can go,
Yet what Repentance i^ few seem to know:
It Is not to cry out Mercy, or to sit
And d^oop, or to confess that thou have failed;
It Is to bewail the Sins thou did commit,
An^ not commit those Sin^ thou have b^wail'd.
He that bewalls, and not forsakes them too,
Confesses rather what he means to do.

And on my thr^bbing Temples potent thus
Beam not so hard! Incessant still you flow,
And still another fervent Flood fucceed^,

And restless turn, and look around for Night;

ECLIPSES 1744.
THIS Year there will be four Eclipses, two of the Sun and two of the Moon; but
neither of them will be visi^le here.

The First is an Eclipse of the Sun, the first Day of April, at Five in the
Afternoon; but the Moon's Latitude being 38 m. 42 sec. South, and al^ne,
without the Parral^^, g^eater than the Semidiameter of the Penumbra, ^1 m. 39
^ec. It cannot be seen in this Part of the World.

The Second is a^ Eclipse of the Moon, on April the 15th, at three in the
Afternoon, therefore invisible here; but will be visible almost over all
Eur^pe, Asia, and A^rica; about 8 Digits when greatest.

The Third is an Eclipse of the Sun, on the 24th of Septem^er, at Eight in the
Afternoo^, therefore not to be seen here; but tow^rds ^^e North E^st Parts of
Tart^^y, it will be a great Eclipse.

The Fourth and last is an Eclipse o^ the Moon, on the 10th of October, at
Eight in the Morning; but the Moon going down before the Eclipse begins, it
cannot be s^en he^e; but f^rther to the Westward, this Eclipse when greatest
will be visible five Digit^ and a half.
