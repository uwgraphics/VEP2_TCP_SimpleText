The New Way of Marriage.
OR, A Pleasant Contract between John and Kate.
Marriage that simple Contract still does bind,
And mittigate the freedom of the mind:
Kate for prevention of that endless strife,
Will be a Mistress rather then a Wife.
To a Pleasant New Tune.
With Allownace.





John. DEarest do,
You easily may,
The place is agreeing to it,
And no one can see us do it
then don't delay:
The torment is so great,
that I endure;
That you must immediately
kill or cure:
For time admits of no demurr,
in such a case as this:
I Would erather dye,
Then be so nigh,
and not reap bliss.

Kate. O kind John,
why so fast?
Yet for all this clatter,
I know no such matter,
there is no have:
I Am not at leisure yet
to be undone,
Though you languish
Still in pain,
and make moan:
Let the Parson speak some words,
and we shall soon agree;
For my mind is to be kind,
only to thee.

John. DEarest Love,
Think what you say,
If once the Parson prove it,
You never can remove it,
night nor day.
Marriage is a tie,
does fools confine,
They no sooner enter in,
but repine:
Then who would feed
In one poor Dish,
and that unwholesome dressed:
When he is sure,
Ha can procure,
a nobler Feast?

Then dear Kate,
my only joy;
I have a way more easy,
And that I know will please thee,
mark what I say:
We will the modish way
of love pursue,
Love and lie without a tie,
yet still be true.
Thus in each others joys will we
receive the rapting bliss,
And this shall all the contract be,
sealed with a kiss.

Kate. But dear John,
it is well known,
Young Men their love does last
No longer then the pleasure's past,
ans so be gone.
Therefore if you mean with me,
to ease your mind:
To this you must immediately
be confined.
That you on none but me do build,
your faith and love alone:
Then I will thus enviting yield,
come dear John.

John. Dearest since
you thus comply,
I plight my faith in trust,
And to it will be just,
until I dye:
My fancy shall no more
a roving fly,
But to thee I constantly
my self will tie:
Till we have acted what we meant,
and clay'd each others heart,
Then as we came, with joint consent,
we will kiss and part.

Kate. Well kind John,
my love you have won,
I like this indefferent well,
When either with enjoyment swell,
to stay, or be gone.
Then don't with Courtship sue,
you have gained the field,
But to pleasure pay it is due,
I freely yield.
Being thus agreed, they went away
all sorrow to remove:
Within each other to enjoy,
the sweets of Love.

FINIS.
