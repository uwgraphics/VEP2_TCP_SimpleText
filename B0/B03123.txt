AN EPITAPH Upon His Late MAJESTY, King CHARLES the II.
THE Statue, which the Rhodians say,
The Sun Descends on every Day;
Is also here in ENGLAND set
Within this Royal Cabinet;
To whose Eternal Hallowed-Vrn,
Pilgrims from Far, shall come and Mourn:
Their Snowy-Heads shall Prostrate here,
And Drop a Pearly-Aged Tear.
TIME, that does make of All his Game,
And over all our Hours does Reign;
With this Great Treasure now Possessed,
May set Him down in Peace, and Rest;
While We (through Sorrows-Vale) go on,
As CAESAR past Great-Rubicon.
Thy Actions cannot be Inrol'd,
Nor can upon the Brass be told,
Nor can be set in Amell'd-Gold,
Like Wonders that the Poets tell
Of HERO'S that in Marble Dwell;
Which like to Rocks that Tempests Scorn,
And often are Angry with the Storm;
Must Bow, and yield at TIMES Great Call,
And into Flinty-pieces fall:
While thy Blessed Name shall still Outlive
(All the Decay that Age can give)
More sweet then those Hydaspes Lends,
And the Famed- Phoenix e're she Ends:
Thy Spirit did (like Elijah) Fall
To Bless us at thy FUNERAL.
FINIS.
Printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden-Ball, in Pye-Corner: 1685.
