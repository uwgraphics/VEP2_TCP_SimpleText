I A. B. do sincerely Promise and Swear, That I will be Faithful, and bear True
Allegiance to His Majesty King WILLIAM.

So help me God.

I A. B. do Swear, That I do from my Heart Abhor, Detest, and Abjure, as
Impious and Heretical, that Damnable Doctrine and Position, That Princes
Excommunicated or Deprived by the Pope, or any Authority of the Sea of Rome,
may he Deposed or Murdered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever.

And I do Declare, That no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or
Potentate, has, or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority,
Preeminence, or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm.

So help me God.
