The fourth will be of the Moon, on the 8 day of September, about two a Clock

The Occasion and Exposition of the four Lines below the Chronology in my last
Years Almanac, is as follows.
THe Printer according to an Act of Council at that time, caused alter the said
Chronology, by taking out the Gun-powder-Plot, and put in the Birth of their
Prince, which I considering to be no Robbery, but a fair Change, to take out
old Plots, to make Room for new Ones, caused me fear likewise that the
Rebellion of Ireland should have the same sentence seeing they had a new one
upon the wheel, but contrary my expectation, they suffered me to keep it in
until the other was brought to effect as I suppose, which occasioned me to put
in these four lines following by way of Anagram, it not being time then to
write my meaning in plain Terms, the lines were these.

What reason proud do thou so much excel,
Consider their is harm it did rebel,
What reason is I mean, unty the knots
And you shall find it is but --
Now if you change two Letters, viz. r in proud after the d it will be powd'r,
and t in it to make up the t that what will want when its last letter t makes
up Treason with the following word reason, and so let the last letters of one
word in the Ir is harm i. go as much in the beginning of the following, as make
it the Irish army, so will the four lines meaning be.

What powder Treason do thou so much excel
Consider the Irish army did rebel
What Treason is, I mean, unty the knots,
And you shall find it is but popish plots.
A Common Prayer Book for all those that fain would have one, but dare not use
it. Litany.
From all these apparent Atheists
Called Protestants defending Papists.
From Oaths so made against the Pope
That brings true Protestants to rope.
From Friars, Priests and Jesuits
And their new cut throat Profelyts,
From all those of a wavering mind,
That change their judgment with the wind;
From those who live by cheats and quirks,
And those who Organs brings to Kirks;
From those who uses holy water,
And secretly their beads do patter;
From Cuckolds that wear gilded horns,
And those who raise the price of corns;
From those their neighbors that backbite,
And in the same do take delight;
From those that lie for Scant of News,
And those in Athol that wear trews,
From those that hate our King and Queen,
Or any way molest their Reign,
Liberanos Domine.

An Apology for the Author and his Works.
WHereas some out of Malice, others out of Ignorance, have put very bad
Constructions on my self and on my works; as for the malicious Carpers, I have
little to say, seeing Momus and Zoilus must have their Successors in all ages,
but I shall endeavor to convince the ignorant with as great facility, and
plainness as this small page can permit. 1. They say, that Astrology and
foretelling the weather is unlawful, uncertain, and without any Grounds.

Answer, That natural Astrology, as in foretelling the weather and natural
diseases, or the like, is drawn from very good and certain grounds, since I
hope they will not be so brutish as to deny the Influence of the Sun, by whose
position to us, alters the four seasons of the year, and that the position of
the Moon to the Sun alters the Tides of the Sea: For a conjunction commonly
called the New Moon, or an opposition commonly called the Full Moon, cause
Spring Tides and a Square commonly called the Quarter Moon, being so weak that
the sea is not so far pressed up upon the land, as at the or as may easily be
demonstrat by a figure, which this page will not permit of; as for other
Aspects, as or the like, their effects are nor observable, neither are there
any Reason for it, by which I hope they will be forced, either to confess, that
the rest of the Planets in their positions to us, and Aspects with the Sun and
Moon, and among themselves does daily alter the weather, or contradict Reason,
for which cause, I have kept a Diery of the weather, since September 1684.
which assists me greatly in judging the weather, and if Encouragement were
given, could in an Ephemeris trace out the weather, and other natural
occurrences, that from henceforth these Carpers should be ashamed that ever
they disallowed it.

2. They think it Popery to keep in the Moveable Feasts, and Saints days in the
Almanac.

Answer, Since the Terms of the year, and whole Fairs of the Kingdom almost
depend on them, they cannot be omitted without great Confusion and Loss to the
Kingdom, which shall never be my Endeavor, unless it be done by Authority, but
desires they might be observed by the true Rule for finding them; for my own
part I do not believe our Savior was born on the 25 day of December, nor St.
John the Baptist upon the 24 day of June, seeing there is greater Reason that
our Savior was born at or about the Vernal Equinoctial in March, and St. John
the Baptist in September, as may be proven, but I omit it for brevitys lake.

As to the Carpers against my Arithmetic Book, I say,
All these unlearned that cannot reach it,
And those so dull that cannot teach it;
Come to the middle of (...) Wynd
Where you shall satisfaction find,
From me at a most easy Rate,
I you advise least when too late
You may repent the loss of time
The fault's your own, it is none of mine;
For other Arts that I do teach,
If your Capacity will reach,
You shall be served, as said before,
As for this year, I Will say no more.

Seek the Moons Age in the first and second Column of the Table, and in the two
last Columns you have the true time of full Sea at Leith.

Example to find the full Sea the 7 of April 1690. I find the Moons age by the
following Table, to be 9. which I find in the first Column of this Table, and
over against it in the last Column, I find 8 h. 42 min. the true time of full
Sea required.
