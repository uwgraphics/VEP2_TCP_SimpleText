TO THE READ^^
THis Table following, was for thy (...) (good Christian reader) taken in hand,
(...) through Gods goodness performed and accomplished, as thou see. For the
better understanding whereof, thou art diligently to remember, that such titles
as concern the sense and meaning of the Scripture, are marked thus. Such as
respect Doctrine, either touching faith, or manners, are marked thus. As for the
proper names of men, places etc. they have no note at all set before them. So
that thou may easelie know (by holding the notes and marks) to discern,
yea, to refer every point herein comprehended, to his right end and purpose.
Furthermore, this also has been observed on thy behalf, that look whatsoever
titles begin with one word, though perhaps they conteyne several and
diverse matters, yet they are included thus [. The Lord remove al our sins, as
far from us, as the East is from the West, that by that means through his
special blessing, this and all other good labors, attempted for the instruction
of his children, may (in these ignorant days, and doting old age of the
world) become fruitful, so that our inward man may grow up in all holy
knowledge, and spiritual understanding, and we express the fruits of blessed
obedience in our lives and conversation, till we come at the last to reap that
eternal perfection, which he has reserved to give unto us in the last day,
through Christ Jesus our Lord, and only Savior. So be it.
