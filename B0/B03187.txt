An Excellent New Song, Called, The Private Encounter Between Two Loyal Lovers.
Being Sung in the last New PLAY, called, The married Beau
^ ^ ^

OH fie! what mean I Foolish Maid,
In this remote and silent shade
to meet with you alone;
My Heart does with the place combine,
And both are more your Friends than mine,
And both are more your Friends than mine.
Oh! oh! oh! I shall I shall I shall be undone,
Oh! oh! oh! oh! I shall be undone.
A Savage Beast I would not fear,
Or should I meet with Villains here,
I to some Cave would run:
But such enchanting Art you show,
I cannot strive I cannot go,
I cannot strive I cannot go,
Oh oh oh I shall I shall I shall be undone,
Oh oh oh oh I shall be undone.
Oh fie leave off this foolish fear,
For I am glad to meet you here,
and I must you enjoy:
This silent Grove and pleasant shade,
Were for true lovers Pastime made,
Were for true lovers Pastime made,
Then, oh then, do not, do not, do not me deny,
Oh then, oh then, do not me deny.
Your Beauty can wild Monsters tame,
And likewise Villains hearts inflame,
that they will not anoy:
Your looks, your eyes have charmed me so,
I have no power for to go,
I have no power for to go,
Come, come, come, I must, I must, I must thee enjoy.
Come, come, come, come, I must thee enjoy.
Ah give your sweet temptations over,
I Will touch those dangerous Lips no more,
What must we yet fool on?
Ah now I yield, ah now I fall;
Ah now I have no breath at all;
Ah now I have no breath at all;
And now, now I am, I am I am quite undone.
Ah now now now I am quite undone.
It Is none but you I can adore,
Nay I must love you more and more,
although for Love I die:
My passion ever shall endure;
My Love shall still be firm and pure,
My Love shall still be firm and pure,
And, and, and, in thy in thy in thy arms I Will lie,
and and and and in thy arms I Will lie.
Printed for Charles Barnet.
