London and England Triumphant: At the Proclaiming of King Charles the Second,
by both the Houses of Parliament, the Judges of the Land: with the Lord Mayor,
the Court of Aldermen, and Council of the City, as it was performed with great
Solemnity, and loud Acclamations of joy by the people in general. May the 8th,
1660.
To the Tune of, I am a Jovial Bachelor.




ENgland cast off thy mourning,
redemption now draws near
The Sun begins to shine again
and every thing looks clear,
Thou now have hit the mark at which
thou have so often aimed,
For Royal Charles the Second
is happily proclaimed.
This is the greatest general Joy
I think, that ever was,
And as miraculous a day
as ere was brought to pass,
In less than six months time it was
dangerous to have him named,
Yet now King Charles the Second, etc.
A valiant and more virtuous Prince
England could never boast
Circled about with providence
sent from the Lord of Host
Witness the escape at Worster,
so worthy to be named
But good King Charles the Second, etc.
Our wise Astrologers foretold
the King should nere come home
Lilly and Booker were too bold
to write a Prince his doom
'Twas not for want of ignorance,
but now their Art is maimed
For good King Charles the Second, etc.
shopkeepers might have shut up shops
cause Trading did decay
But since they are in better hopes
they shut up shops for joy
For now they have all things
for which their wishes aimed
Since Royal Charles the Second, etc.
Our Schismatics look sourely
to see our cause of Joy
If it did in their power lie
they would the Cause destroy
Their pride, their grand hypocrisses
and treacheries are tamed,
Since Royal Charles the Second
is Englands King proclaimed.
The second part
to the same Tune


But our Loyal Nobility
and Gentry too, may say,
This is a great deliverance,
just at the latter day,
When as the King in sorrow sat
and Kingdom was inflamed,
God raised him to a Throne of State
For now the King's proclaimed.
The Royal Clergy have been starved
beheaded and undone,
Whilst Weavers, and whilst Cobblers did
into their Pulpits run,
Where Blasphemy was daily taught,
and things not to be named
Till good King Charles the Second
was royally proclaimed.
The Law and sacred Gospel too
were both Malignants grown
They use our Lands, as if we had
no title to our own,
Rebellion was a Babe of Grace
and Loyalty was blamed
Till good King Charles the Second
was lawfully proclaimed.
The Church of England was abused
grossly by such as those
Our Apron Priests made mouths at us
our Saints sung through the Nose,
Beloved take up arms, they cried
and do as we have framed,
But now even in their height of pride,
King Charles is new proclaimed.
If Oliver and Bradshaw had
but lived to see this day
Without all doubt they would run mad
and hang themselves for joy
If was a dreadful danting
but for to hear him named.
Oh! how they would fall a canting
to hear him King proclaimed.
The Sun shone very brightly, yet
the rain and hail did fly
Which shows when lawful Sons do reign
all hail the Heavens cry,
The joys of all the City,
were highly to be famed
When Royal Charles the Second
was lawfully proclaimed.
With drum and trumpet, horse and foot
and every Trained-band
As if they meant for to go to it
against all that dare withstand
God save the King, all people cried
as soon as he was named
And thus King Charles the Second
was royally proclaimed.
God save the King, cry I too
And Parliament also
That Prince and people may unite
and prosperously grow,
God bless my good Lord General Monk
may he be ever famed.
Who was the cause that good King Charles
the Second is proclaimed.
FINIS.
