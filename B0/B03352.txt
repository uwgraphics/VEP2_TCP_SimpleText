The forsaken Maids Frollick OR, A Farewell to fond Love,
In which she does plainly and properly prove,
That a flattering tongue is the ruin of Love,
And therefore all you that are well in your wits,
Beware of Trappans, Maid look to your Hits.
The Tune is, The Knight and begger-wench.


YOu Females all give ear,
To that which I shall declare
and listen unto my Song,
I loved a young man as fair
To me he past compare,
my too much Love did me wrong,
He often did vow and professed,
that he would be true to me:
But now he is forsworn
I scorn for to mourn,
Another^s as good as he.
The features of his face
Did yield becoming grace,
but his tongue and his heart were base:
When first he began to toy,
I seemed a little coy,
and yet my heart leapt for joy.
so frollick he was and free
in coakfing and kissing of me,
that had he but
more me put to it,
I had bin as bad as he,


His teeth did appear like Pearls
His locks they hung down in Curls,
May fetter a thousand Girls,
His forehead is mounted high
And whiter then Ivory,
This is a brave man thought I.
His lips had a very good smack,
His Eyes were-both bonny and black,
Thought I, if I wed,
For board or bed,
Here Is one that will hold me tack.
When he about me clung
You would think that an Angel sung,
So musical was his Tongue,
To make my heart believe
He could both sigh and grieve,
The Devil so tempted Eve,
This flattering fauning Elf,
When he had got all my pelf,
And squandred my goods,
He left me in the sudds
And bid me go hang my self.


But tarry, soft and fair,
More Men in the World there are
why should I fall in despair,
Since my first Love is spoiled
And I am yet undefiled,
I Will never be more beguild.
his falsehood has set me free,
and now for another I Will be,
harm watch, harm catch.
he is met with his match.
Let him go and be hanged for me.
My spirits I will advance
I Will learn to sing and dance,
but love now and then by chance,
If any Man me will board,
Though he swear by his soul and sword,
I Will never believe a Word,
my reason shall be my guide,
my honesty be my pride,
for if we grant them a kiss
men think that it is,
No more but get up and ride.
It Is neither the tongue or pen
Of any false-hearted men,
shall flatter my faith again,
Since my first Love did get
My Money by slye deceit,
another shall pay the debt.
whatever he gives I Will take
and merry my self I Will make,
Her mind is amiss
That really is
A Lover for Conscience sake.


If a Suitor do turn a Jew,
And will not give Love his due,
Why should a young Wench be true
If Wooing be but the Way
To flatter and then betray,
We Will flatter as well as they,
For they that can break a vow,
Teach women what they shall (...)
If ^o play fast and loose
Be good for the Goose,
It Is good for the Gander too.
For if a deceitful man
My treasury will Trappan,
I Will Coakes him again if I can,
And if there be never a hell
For Lovers that lies do tell,
A Woman may do it as well,
If Batchellors prove not true
The Maidens may do so too.
It Is Wit for Wit,
And Hit for Hit,
And this is but Qui^ for Quo.
But yet the powers above
Do nothing so much approve,
as Loyal and constant Love,
When honest intent invites
And spirit with spirit unites,
those Lovers have true delights,
When all the deceitful Gives
That cozen by twenty and twelves
it is forty to one
e're the Game be done,
They shall be deceived themselves.
