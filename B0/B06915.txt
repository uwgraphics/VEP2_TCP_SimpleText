(...)







I Will persuade him thus and say,
Last time that you together lay,
the Moon it was Eclipsed strange,
And nature did her courses change,
Mars by Dame Venus was beguiled,
And so your wife got you with child.
this bargain made brought much content
Home in all haste the farmer went;
And told his wife so strange a tale,
As make her Countenance look pale;
Dear wife quoth he I am perplexed,
Never was man before so vexed.
I am intumbered with great pains,
from top to toe through all my veins;
My back and sides grieve me so sore,
Such pains I never felt before:
But yet the greatest pain I tell ye.
Lies rumbling up and down my belly.
Husband quoth she I can you tell,
Of one that soon can make you well,
He cures as I do understand,
All diseases that he takes in hand;
And if you pleased have it so,
I Will to him with y^r water go.
Next morning with a good intent,
the good-wife to the Doctor went:
and shows to im her Husbands water,
Now mark th jest that follows after:
Cox body quoth ^e Doctor mild,
thy Husband s^ly is with Child.
the woman she ^^s much amaz^d,
And on the D^^ strangely gazed;
Good Sir in ki^ness now tell me,
How such thins in a man may be?
I will, quoth he make you no doubt,
And time at ^st will bring it out.
When Luna last was in the Eclips,
You with your Husband joined Lips,
Then Jupiter being wrapped in thunder,
turn^d Venus up while Mars lay under
By which Conjunction well I wot,
Your husband then with child was got.
Alas, alas, then said his wife,
Is there no means to save his life?
I would not for a thousand pound,
My husband he should fall to the Ground,
Faith quoth the Doctor there is none,
No ways to save his life but one.
Kind loving Sir, then answered she,
If you will be so good to me,
to tell how I his life may save,
I Will give whatever you will have:
No cost nor pains that I will spare,
to save his life whom I love so dear:
But first (...) he, i will have you swear,
And also have a special care,
to let no body know while you live,
What Physic he is to receive;
She straightway ^ound it with an Oath,
I Will keep your Counsel by my troth.
then mark me well what is to be done,
Each night hour setting of the Sun,
His Supper then you must provide,
Of eggs, and some choice meats beside:
And for to strengthen his weak ^ack
You must give him a pint of Sack.
Which being done, put him to bed,
and lay soft Pillovvs under his head;
then make for him a Posset fine,
With Sugar and svveet muskadine;
Commixt with Cinnamon and mace,
And let him swallow it down apace.
When he has slept an hour or tvvain,
then you must came to him again,
And bring with you a lusty maid,
which to his belly must be laid:
So let them merrily sleep together,
and lovingly embrace each other.
this course you must for 3 weeks take,
And then besure that it will make,
the pain too from his back and side,
the maid the torment shall abide,
And afterward in little space,
She will bring forth a babe of Grace.
And when the maid is brought to bed,
Your self must lie down in her stead;
And because nothing must he known,
Folks must believe the Child's your own,
Besure to take this course said he,
So shall your Husband ^^^ed be.
the woman having heard this news,
Ran home in haste how could she choose
Where she did see her husband lie,
Like one just ready for to die:
then presently she did unfold,
All that the Doctor had her told.
Alas quoth he such pangs I have,
there is no means my life to save;
Unless you do a Posset make,
to cure my belly of the ache:
Wherefore the woman out of hand
Did as the Doctor did command.
A Supper of most dainty meat
She made him ready for to eat;
And because he should no Physic lack,
She after Supper gave him Sack;
then kept him warm within his bed,
And with sweet Posset she him fed.
this being done, with Cupids aid,
she got the good will of her maid,
to lie and keep her master vvarm,
and said, he should do her no harm,
the maid at first seemed loath to do,
But at the lass yielded thereto.
And as the Doctor did foretell,
So every thing in order fell,
the maid in time was brought to bed,
the good wife lay down in her stead:
the man was of his burden eased,
the child at Nurse, and all are pleased.
You that these verses hear or read,
If of this Doctor you stand in need,
Enquire him out where he does dwell,
And surely he will use you well,
He Will give you Physic to your mind,
So that your purses be well lined.
