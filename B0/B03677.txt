The honest Tradesmans Honor Vindicated.
OR, The Bragadocia quel'd,
As in this Ditty out is held,

OR, A merry Dialogue between a Swash Blade
And an Artist of London to vindicate trade:

With merry jibes, jears and frumps,
To drive melancholy men out of their dumps,
Pend to make them merry when
Melancholy does possess the brain.
The tune is, General Monk was a Noble man, etc.




Gentleman. I Am a gallant Blade indeed,
and gay Apparel wear,
A fig for Trade and a crown for a Maid,
and a fart for sorrow and care:
I am a Jovial Gentleman
I love Sport and Recreation,
Though I have neither House nor Land,
I keep my self in good fashion,

Tradesman. Some Gentlemen's care is a Lass in his lap
whilst he at a Tradesman is flowting,
Dol with a dishclout has painted her face,
and scorns with her hands to be working:
She thought to be called high in name,
no less than a Lady I wish.
She decked her self in silk and in satin,
yet she is but an ugly Puss.

Gentleman. Alas good Sir when did you come
from the Cities laboring trade,
Look back again now toward home,
and see what for you is made,
Your wife for you has made a Crown,
a gallant fair pair of Horns,
Whilst you are here in our Country
with one that your Calling scorns.

Tradesman. It comes into my memory
sir now you talk of scorning,
Do you remember the Oyster Wench
you met with one Monday morning,
When she was in her silver lace'd Gown
oh then you began to woe her,
But when she cried Oysters in the town
you scorned as much to know her.

Gentleman. We Gentlemen live merry lives,
you but Mecannicks are sir,
Therefore to us you must make known
when ever we do come sir;
You Tradesmen unto it are tide,
you must work hard for money,
Whilst merrily abroad we ride,
to hunt the Fox and Coney.

Tradesman. Now that you talk of hunting sir,
one thing comes in my mind,
You nothing have to do but hunt
therefore it comes by kind,
A hind I do remember well
you lately had in chase,
Her belly high begins to swell,
and you absent the place.

The second Part,
to the same Tune.
Gentleman. YOu Tradesman at your work do moyl,
whilst we to mirth incline sir:
But we do scorn so much to toil,
except it be at the wine Sir:
You tradesmen have great rents to pay
for that we take no care,
We rant and rore it night and day
we spend and never spare.

Tradesman. Now that you talk of Rents good sir.
of Music and of wine.
To pay your debts do not defer,
to your Landlady so fine,
Her Daughter Dol is in great fear,
she shall not see your face,
You have left her to shed many a Tear
and reap your sown disgrace.

Gentleman. If into the Country we but ride,
out ten miles from the City,
No sooner have they our face spied,
but this will be their Ditty,
Your worships welcome to the town,
pray sir what will you have?
Thus are we known of every Clown,
and of each Fool and Knave

Tradesman Sir now you talk of Fools and Knaves,
of Country men and Clowns,
And of true dealing honest men,
that dwell in country Towns,
Were It not for them full well I know,
long we could not live hear,
They toil to Plow, to Reap and Sow,
to feed's with Bread, Beef, and Beer.

Gentleman. Sir this I grant for to be true,
that we by them are fed;
No company I Will keep with you
for I am better bread:
See thou my Rapier by my side,
A broad Hat and long curled Hair,
My Breeches at the knees so wide
that they would make four pair.

Tradesman. Sir, if for your Rapier you had paid,
your Cutler would not frown,
Nor your Bever-maker have been afraid
of your riding out of Town.
Your Tailor he lamenteth still.
for a truth I heard it said
Often viewing of his long Bill,
which you have left unpaid.

Gentleman. Sir, for this present I will rest.
and will no more contend,
I do protest that man is blessed
that is the Tradesmans friend,
You work and sing all care away,
and drink Ale, Beer, and Wine,
Whilst Getlemen do now and then
with great Duke Hmmphrey Dine.

Tradesman. Good God preserve our Royal King
the Yrogeny defend,
With the rest of the Royal Offspring
from those that would contend:
And God so bless the Parliament
that they good Laws may make,
Our future dangers to prevent,
and thus my leave I take.

Finis,
