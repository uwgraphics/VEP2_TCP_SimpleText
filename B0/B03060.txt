THE HUMBLE ADDRESS OF THE HOUSE of COMMONS TO THE KING.
WE Your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Commons in Parliament
Assembled, who have so frequently waited on Your Majesty, with the tender of
our Assistance, for Carrying on the War; come now to Congratulate Your Majesty,
upon the happy Conclusion of it, in a Peace, so Honorable and Advantageous to
the Nation, as sufficiently justifies the Wisdom of the Commons, in Advising,
and Your Majestys Conduct in the Prosecution of it.

The Prospect of the Benefits Your People will receive from the Peace, is very
pleasing; the Honor Your Majesty has Restored to England, of holding the
Balance of Europe, gives Your Subjects great Content: But what Your Commons are
most Affected and Delighted with, is, That Your Majesty's Sacred Person will
now be secure from those many and great Dangers, to which You have so often
Exposed it, for our Sakes; nothing being so evident, as that Your Majesty's
Return in Safety was a Blessing more welcome to Your People, than Peace, and
received with greater Demonstrations of Joy.

We therefore, with Hearts full of Affection, Duty, and Gratitude, do Assure
Your Majesty, in the Name of the Commons of England, That this House will be
ever ready to Assist and Support Your Majesty; Who, by putting a period to the
War, has Confirmed us in the quiet Possession of our Rights and Liberties, and
so fully completed the Glorious Work of our Deliverance.

EDINBVRGH, Reprinted by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer
to His Most Excellent Majesty, ANNO DOM. 1697.
