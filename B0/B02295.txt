Come turn to me thou pretty little one, and I will turn to thee.
To a pleasant new Tune.


SWeet if thou will be
As I am to thee,
Then by Cupids Mother,
I have vowed to have
none other she:
Then turn to me thou pretty little one,
And I will turn to thee.
Those bright eyes of thine
Which do dazzle mine
Like the stars of Heaven,
Which do keep their even
course and shine:
Then let us in conjunction meet
and both our loves combine.
If that lovely Face,
Will to mine give place,
That with loves devotion
We may use the motion,
of embrace:
Then sit thee down my pretty little one
and let us love a space.
What hurt is in this?
For to take a kiss
If it may be granted
I that long have wanted
such a bliss:
Then be not sparing of a few,
whereas such plenty is.
If thy breasts do pant
For the milk they want,
Every Hill and Mountain
To supply each Fountain,
be not scant:
Then give to me thy lilly white hand,
and I thee mine will grant.
If so be that I,
May but thee come nigh,
The Vine and Elm shall never,
Ioyn more close together
then will I:
Then show thy fruits my amorous joy
and I Will with love supply.
If that thou do crave,
Silks and Garments brave
Or what rich attire
Could thy heart desire
to receive:
Declare to me thou pretty little one,
thou can but ask and have.
From the Indies far,
Where rich Jewels are;
I will bring thee treasure
Far beyond all measure
and compare:
Then be not coy my pretty little one
for I no cost will spare

Sweetheart for thy sake
I will never make,
Choice of any other,
Then by Cupids Mother
freely speak:
It Is at thy choice my dearest Love,
either to leave or take.
I thy Mary gold
Wrapped in many fold,
Like the golden Clyent
To the Sun supplient
show it is gold:
Display the beams my glorious Sun
and I Will to thee unfold.
Those bright locks of hair
Spreading over each ear,
Every crisp and curle
Far more rich then pearl,
does appear:
Then be thou constant in thy love
and I will be thy Dear.
Till I have possessed,
Thee whom I love best,
I have vowed for ever,
In thy absence never,
to take rest:
Deny me not thou pretty little one,
In whom my hopes are blessed.
If a kiss or two
Can thee a favor do
Were it more then twenty
Love's indu'd with plenty
Lovers know:
For thy sweet sake a thousand take,
for that is the way to woo.
It does grieve my heart
From thee for to part
It is to me more pleasant,
Ever to be present
where thou art:
Yet in the absence of a friend,
my love shall never start.
As to me thou art kind,
Duty shall me bind
Ever to obey thee,
Reason so does sway me
to thy mind:
Thou have my heart where e're thou art
although I stay behind.
In thy bed or bark
I will be thy mark,
Couples yet more loving
Never had their moving
from the Ark:
Welcome to me my only joy,
all times, be it light or dark,
London, Printed for Charles Tyus at the three Bibles on London Bridge.
