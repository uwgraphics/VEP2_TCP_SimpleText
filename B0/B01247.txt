A Ballad of Anne Askew, Entitled: I am a Woman poor and Blind.


I Am a Woman poor and blind
and little knowledge remains in me,
L^ng have I sought and feign would I find,
what herbs in my garden were best to be.
(...) garden ^ ^^ne which is unknown,
that God at his goodness gave unto me:
I (...) my own body wherein I would have sown
the ^^^de of Christ's true verity.
My ^^^^t whithin me is vexed sore,
m^ (...) stri^^th against the same:
My sorrows no increase daily more and more,
(...) suffers most ^itter pain:
I wi^h (...) being thus of strife,
would ^aint have his a^peace and (...):
(...) knowing in my mortal life,
what (...) I might (...) to please God best,
With (...) intent and one accord.
(...) a Ga^d^er that I did know:
I went (...) him for the love of the Lord,
true seeds in my garden for to so^
Then this proud Gardner seeing me so blind,
he thought ^n me to work his will:
And flattered me with words so kind,
to have me continue in blindness still,
He fed me then with lies and morke^,
for venial sins he bad me go,
To give my money ^o stones and storkes,
which was stark lies and nothing so.
^^^th ^^^^king meat then was I fe^,
(...) in ^^^pe me from my salvation*
I ha^ ^^e^^-ta^^^s of Mass, and Bulls of lead,
not one word spoken of Christ's passion.
In me was ^^wne all kind of fained seeds,
with Popish ceremonies many a ^ns,
(...) of Requiem with other Ingling deeds,
till Gods spirit out of my gard^n was gone.
Then was ^ commanded full straigtly.
(...) I would be sure:
To (...), or some Chau^ity,
in ^e pr^^^^ for whilst the world endure.
(...), says he, it is lies,
(...) I must abhor:
(...) not with (...) any manner of wise,
but (...) as (...) ^^^hers have (...) before,


My trust I did put then in ye Diuiles works,
thinking them sufficient, my soul to save.
Being worse then either Jews or Turks,
thus Christ of his merrits I did derpaue.
I might liken my self with a w^f^ll heart,
unto the ^umbe man in Luke the ^luen:
From whom Christ caused the Devil to depart
but shortly after he took the other se^ue^.
My time thus good Lord so wickedly spent,
alas shall I die the sooner therefore:
No Lord, I find written in thy Testament,
thut thou have mercy enough in store.
For such sinners as the Scripture says,
that will gladly repent and ^^llow thy word:
Which I will no deny whilst I have breath,
for Prison, fire, Faggot, nor ^^r^e sword.
Strength me good Lord in thy truth to stand,
for the bloody Butchers have me at their will
With there slaughter knives ready drawn in there hand
my simple ca^kas to devour and kill.
O Lord forgive me mine offense,
for I have offended thee very sore:
Take therefore my sinful body from hence,
and then shall I vild wretch offend thee no more
I would wish all christians and faithful friends
to keep them from this Gardners hands,
For he will bring them soon unto their ends,
with cruel torments of fierce firebrands.
I dare not presume for him to pray,
because the truth of him was well known:
And since that time he has gone as^ray,
and much pestilent seed abroad he has sown
Because that now I have no space,
the cause of my death truly to show:
I trust hereafter by Gods holy grace,
that all faithful men shall it plainly know,
To thee O Lord I bequeath my spirit,
which art the workemaster of the same:
It is thine, Lord therefore take it of right,
my carkas on earth I leave, from whence it came
Although to ashes it (...) now burned,
I know thou can raise it agains,
In the same likeness that thou it formed,
^t Heaven with the^ evermore to remain.
