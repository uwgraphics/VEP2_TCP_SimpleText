God speed the Plow, and bless the Corn-mow.
OR, A new merry Dialogue between a Plowman and a Servingman.
The Servingman most stoutly does dispute.
The Husbandman his speeches does confute
The Servingman says his Calling is the hest,
The Plowman says in that he does but jest,
But in conclusion as I do understand
The Husbandman he got the better hand.
The tune is, The Duke of Norfolk.


MY noble friends give ear,
If mirth you love to hear,
I Will tell you as fast as I can
A story very true,
Then mark what does ensue,
concerning of a husbandman,

Servingman. A Servingman did meet
A Husbandman in the street,
and thus unto him he began
I pray you tell to me
Of what calling you be
or if you be a servingman,

Husbandman. Quoth he my brother dear
The Coast I mean to clear,
and the truth you shall understand
I no no one disdain,
But this I tell you plain,
I am a Husbandman.

Servingman. If a Husbandman you be,
Then come along with me
and I Will help you as soon as I can
Unto a gallant place
Where in a little space,
you may be a Servingman.

Husbandman. SIr for your diligence
I give you many than^s
then answered the plowman again
I pray you to me show
Whereby that I may know
what pleasure has a Servingman

Servingman. A Servingman has pleasure
Which passes time and measure
when ye Haw^ on hi^ fist does stan^
His Hood and V^rvils brave
And other things he have
which yields joy to a servingman

Husbandman. My pleasure's more then that,
To see my Oxen fat
and to prosper well under my hand
And therefore I do mean
With my Horses and my Team
to keep my se^f a Husbandman.

Servingman. O it is a gallant thing
In the prime time of the Spring
to hear the Huntsman now and than
His Bugle Horn to blow
And the Hounds run all arow
that is pleasure for a servingman.

Servingman. To hear the Beagle cry
And to see the Falcon fly
and the Hare trip over the plain
W^ile the huntsman and the hound
Make Hills and Dales rebound.
that is pleasu^e for a servingman.

Husbandman. It Is pleasanter you know
To see the Corn to grow*
and to grow so well on the Land,
The plowing and the sowing,
The reaping and the mowing
yields pleasure to the husbandman

Servingman. At our Table you may eat
Al^ ^or^s (...) dainty meat,
Pi^ Cony* Goose, C^pon and Swan
A^^ wi^h Lords and Ladies fine
You m^^ ^rink Beer, Ale and Wine
that is p^^^su^e for a servingman.

Husbandman. While you eat Goose and Capon
I Will feed on Beef and Bacon,
and piece of hard cheese now and than,
^e Pudding have and Souse
Always ready in the house
which contents the honest husbandman

Servingman, At the Court you may have
Your Garments fine and brave
and Cloak and gold lace laid upon
A shirt as white as milk,
And wrought with finest silk
that's pleasure for a servingman.

Husbandman. Such proud and costly Gear,
Is not for us to wear,
among ye briers and ye brambles many one
A good strong Russet Coat
And at your need a groat
will suffice the honest husbandman

Husbandman. A Proverb here I tell
Which likes my humor well
and remember it well I can
If a Courtier be too bold
He may want when he is old
then farewell the servingman.

Servingman. It needs must be confessed
That your Calling is the best
^ no longer discourse with you I can
And henceforth I will pray
By night and by day,
heaven bles the honest husbandman

Servingman. To end my Ditty now
I say God speed the plow
for that's the chief stay of our land
And he that takes the pains
Deserves to have the gains
which is the honest husbandman,
And thus my loving friends
My Story now it ends.
according as I first began.
There Is none that passes by
Can say my Song's a lie,
concerning of the Husbandman.
