Mondayes Work. OR The two honest neigbours both birds of a feather
Who are at the Alehouse both merry together.

To the tune of, I owe my Hostess money.


GOod morrow neigbour Gamble,
Come let you and I go ramble,
Last night I was shot
Through the brains with a Pot,
and now my stomach does wamble:
Your Possets and your Caudles,
Are fit for babes in Cradles:
A piece of salt Hog,
And a hair of the old Dog
is good to cure our drunken Noddles.
Come hither mine Host, come hither,
Here Is two birds of a feather,
Come hither mine Host
With a Pot and a Tossed,
and let us be merry together.
I rose in the morning early,
To take this Juice of barley,
But if my wife Ione
Know where I were gone,
she would call me to a Parley*
My bones I do not favor,
But honestly do labor:
But when I am out.
I must make a mad bout
come here is half a pot to thee neigbour.
Come hither, etc.
Gramarcy neighbor Iinkin,
I see thou love no shrinking,
And I for my part,
From thee will not start,
come fill us a little more drink in.
In The week we ask but one day,
And that is next after Sunday,
Our custom we will hold,
Although our Wives scold,
the Mault-man comes a Monday.
Come hither, etc.
Come let us have our Liquor about us,
Mine Host do not misdoubt us,
Yet if we should call,
And pay none at all,
you were better be without us:
But we are no such fellows,
Though some in clothes excel us,
And yet have no coin,
For Liquor to Join.
yet we have both whites and yellowes.
Come hither, etc.
We scorn those rooking Rorers,
That are such common scorers,
No coin they can spare,
Because they are
such Dicers and such Whorers.
But we do hate such doing,
We Will wast no means in wooing,
Yet such as they be
Make you think that we
will not pay what is owing.
Come hither mine Host, come hither,
Here Is two birds of a feather,
Come hither mine Host
With a pot and a Tossed,
and let us be merry together.
The second Part.
To the same Tune.


COme ply your work my Masters,
Let us not be time wasters,
To work or to play
Very hard (as some say)
is a sign of good fore-casters.
Much prate to me is loathing
To cumber the house for nothing,
I hate a long tale,
Give me some more Ale,
which is meat, drink, and clothing,
Come hither mine Host, come hither,
Here Is two birds of a feather,
Come hither mine Host
With a Pot and a Tossed,
and let us be merry together
If wicked Will the Weauer,
Or True the Tailor either,
Were here with us now,
To part we knew not how,
till we were drunk together:
Or Tom the neat Shoemaker,
Or Kit the Iouiall Baker,
If any one of these
Come hither and see's,
with us heel be a Partaker.
Come hither mine Host, come hither,
Here Is two birds of a feather,
Come hither mine Host
With a Pot and a Tossed,
and let us be merry together.
But since there is no more here
We Will say as we did before here,
Between us we will call,
And pay for it all,
for we scorn to go on the score here,
Let Us take off our Liquor roundly,
And though we do drink soundly,
Our humor is such,
We Will not drink so much,
until we both on the ground lie.
Come hither mine Host, come hither,
Here Is two birds of a feather,
Come hither mine Host
With a Pot and a Tossed,
and let us be merry together.
Now lest our Wives should find us,
It Is fit we should look behind us,
Let Us see what is done,
Then pay and be gone.
as honestly has assigned us.
It Is strong Ale I conceive it,
It Is good in time to leave it,
Or else it will make,
Our foreheads to ache,
it is vanity to out brave it.
Come hither mine Host, come hither
Here Is two birds of a feather,
Come hither mine Host
With a Pot and a Tossed,
and let us be merry together.
FINIS.
