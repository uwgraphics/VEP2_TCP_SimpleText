and outward conversation and living is very meet for the same. Which doing, ye
shall minister unto me an acceptable pleasure, and give me cause to requite

that I may be advertised by the bringer hereof. Thus fare you heartily well.

incumbent velitis. In cuius rei, etc.

Notes to be diligently observed.
YE shall note that in a presentation by this word Ecclesiam parochialem, is
intended always a parsonage. Howbeit now a days many be wont to write Ad
rectoriam Ecclesiae parochialis de N. But if the presentation be to a vicarage,
then ye may not say ad Ecclesiam, but ad Vicariam. And ye shall understand,
that the presentation to a Vicarage appertains of common right to the Parson,
for the Vicar is in effect but the Parsons deputy. Howbeit the Parson with
assent of his Patron and Ordinary may grant away the patronage of the
Vicarage from him and his successors to another man and his heirs or
successors for ever.

Furthermore ye shall understand, that sometime one man has the nomination to a
benefice, and an other the presentation, in which case he that has the
presentation can present no other person to the Ordinary, but such as the other
man shall name by his sufficient writing under Seal.

Also the King shall join with no man in presentment, but shall have the whole
presentment alone in all cases. And if the king be entitled by reason of the
custody of his ward: then ye shall say, Et ad nostram aduocationem ratione
custodiae terrae and haeredis quondam Comitis de A. defuncti qui de nobis
tenuit in capite and in manu nostra existentis spectant etc.

And if the King be entitled by reason of the temporalties and possessions of
an Archbishopricke or bishopric being in time of vacation in his hands: then
ye shall say in the presentation, Et quae ad nostram spectat donationem ratione
Episcopat' Cantuariensis iam vacantis and in manu nostra existentis, ratione
vacationis sedis Cantuariensis and temporalium eiusdem iam de iure and facto,
vacantis, and in manibus nostris existent. etc.

Finally concerning chauntries, free chapels and Prebends, ye shall observe
and know, that some be presentatiue, and some donatiue: presentatiue be of such
a nature, that ye cannot confer them but by way of presentation to the
ordinary, the form whereof is set forth before. But chauntries, free
chapels, and prebends donatiues, be of that nature, that ye need not to
present the person to whom ye will confer the same to the ordinary: but it
suffices to give the same by your Charter of grant under your seal: the
form whereof ensues hereafter. But take heed ye present not your Clerk to
the Ordinary, unto that which is donatiue by your letters patents, for if ye
do the nature is changed, and ye can no more make collation of it, but ye
must needs now present your Clerk to the Ordinary, which if ye do not within
six months, the Ordinary may take advantage of the laps.

Here follows the form and manner how to make Releases.
Ye shall understand, that there be sundry sorts of Releases, Some be of a man's
whole right which he has in lands, tenements, or hereditaments: Othersome be
of actions reals and personals, and of other things, which kind of release is
usually called a general acquitance, the form whereof ye shall find in the
title of Acquitances. But concerning the nature of Releases, where they take
place, and of the strength and virtue of the words in the same, I remit you to
Master Litteltons book of Tenures: Mine intent and purpose here, is only to
describe sundry forms and examples of them.

Michaelis Archangelis, and Annuntiationis beatae Mariae virginis aequis

It is also requisite to put in certainty in their copies all the customs,
rents, and services, and that is in ancient demean, and in all places where
the tenants have their lands by copy to them and their heirs after the
custom of the manor: for there they have or ought to have a customary Roll,
wherein is every man's land contained, and what rent, customs and services
every man ought to pay and do, and in many places their laws and their
customs be put into writing, and remain in their own custody, to put them in
remembrance when need shall require.

But in case there should be made any new incrochments or intakes enclosed or
taken in, out of the commons, or any mine new found, as lead, or tin, coal,
iron, stone, or other such, if a copy shall be made thereof, it is necessary
and expedient to put the rent thereof in the tenants copy, for it is a new
thing that has not gone by custom, and it would be put in the customarie Roll,
for this new approuement may fortune either to increase or diminish in the
rent, and therefore must the rents be continually expressed.

Also where a man has a Lordship, wherein be many tenants that hold their
land of the Lord by copy of Court roll for term of life, and have no estate of
inheritance in the same, In all such cases must the rents be declared in copies.

A recognition of a tenant what he holds of the Lord.

Ye shall understand, that there is no manner of states made of free land by
poll deed, or deed indented, but there may be made the same of copy lands by
copy, if they be well made and entered in the court Rols. And the Steward is
bound by law and conscience to be a Judge indifferent between the tenants and
the Lord, and to enter their copies truly in the court rols of the Lord, for
that shall be a great commodity to the Lord to know his presidents, customs
and services, and also a great assurance to the tenants: for if their copies
should be lost, they may vouch and resort to the Court Rols, and the Steward
may make them new copies, according to the old presidents in the Lords records,
even as it is of free land, or of any other matter at the common law, when it
is enrolled according to the statute, which shall ever testify the truth, what
chance soever happens to the parties, as ye may read in the book of
Surueying, wherein be many good examples of enrolling and making of records.

villenage delivered and discharged, as we now by these our letters patents,
manumit, deliver, and discharge for ever the said I. B. otherwise called F. G.

And ye shall understand also, that we the foresaid T. S. and M. have remised,
released, and for us and our heirs for ever, quite claimed, as we now by these
presents do remit, release, and quite claim to the lame I. B. otherwise called
F. G. and all his heirs, sequel and progente, gotten, or to be gotten etc. all
and all manner actions, real and personal, suits, quarrels, services,

cause, pretense, or color, from the beginning of the world until the day of
making of these presents: So that neither we the said T. and M. etc. nor any of
us, nor our heirs, nor any other by us, for us, or in our name, shall or may
from henceforth have, exact, sue, claim, or challenge any manner right, title,
action, interest, or demand of villenage or bondage against the said I. B.

TO all Christian people to whom this present comes, Anthony Earl, Lord of
R. S. and of R. sends greeting in our Lord God everlasting. Be it known unto
all people, that whereas we by the information of certain persons, have made
title and claim to one I. T. of Linne in the county of Norff. and to one W.
T. brother of the same I T of L. in the county of R. and all their issues of
their bodies coming, to be villeines and bound unto us, as appe^dant to our
manor of I. in the county aforesaid: And forasmuch as we find neither proof
nor sufficient ground, whereby we may understand that the said I. and W. or any
of their issue should be villeins or bound to us, but by evident proof in
sundry wise brought and showed to us, we rather understand the contrary to be
true. Therefore we being desirous to set all doubtful matters apart, and
willing the said I. and W. to be no further grieved or molested wrongfully
without sufficient cause, and that they may from henceforth live in suertie for
the same, have remised, released, etc. vt supra.

chart mihi and alijs fact' E.F. generosum, vt per eandem chartam inde
confectam, cuius datum est etc. manifest liquet and apparet: Caeteraque omnia
etc.

And ye shall understand, that this is the use in taking of seisin and
possession. First ye must expel all persons out of the house, and call unto
you certain neighbors, to witness at the former door, then cause one to read
the deed of Feoffement, and if it be in latin, some body must interpret and
declare it to the witnesses, in the mother tongue, the^ let one of the
Atturneys, he that gives the possession, take the door, or the ring thereof
in his hand, and set the hand of the receiver of possession upon the door in
like manner, saying: By the authority of this deed of feoffement, I make unto
you Livery and seisin of this tenement, and lands, etc. according to the effect
of the same deed, and therein I set you in firm and peaceable possession. Then
cause the feoffees to enter.

This done, it is good to write the names of the^ that be present, to bear
witness, on the back of the deed as thus:

Data and liberata fuit seisina, and pacifica possessio E. F. iuxt formam and
effectu^ huius charte, per W.M. atturnatum etc. in pn^tia A. B.C D. de villa
p^dict' tertio die Maij etc.

And if the possession be given of a manor, it is good to have a Court holden
immediately in the name of the new Lord: And there let the euide^ces and deeds
be showed to the tenants, and they to be required to atturne and agree to the
same estate. And as many as atturn, let their names be entered in the Court
roll.

Liuerie and seisin of lands is commonly made by a piece of the same earth,
taken by the feoffor, and given to the feoffee, together with the deed, in
manner aforesaid.

Here follows diverse and sundry kinds of Supplications, Bills of complaint,
Answers and other Petitions for any matter in the Kings Courts.
To the King our most dread Sovereign Lord.
MOst lamentably complains unto your highness, your poor, faithful and
obedient subject T. V. of H. in the county of K. uncle and heir unto I. V
late of the city of L. Tiler, that is to wit, brother of T. V. father of the
said I. V. that where the said I. in his life was seized of his demean as of
fee, of and in two mesuages, xxx. acres of land errable, wood, and pasture
severally set, lying and being in the parishes of L. M. in the said county.
And so he being seized thereof died seized, so that the said two mesuages and
other the premises descended and of right ought to descend unto your poor
subject, as uncle and heir to the said I. V. So it is most gracious sovereign
Lord, that certain writings evidences, escripts and miniments concerning the
premises which your said poor and faithful subject should prove his true
title by, unto the premises, be come into the hands and possession of T. V
and V. W. aforesaid, by the having whereof the said W. and V. have conveyed
diverse and sundry crafty estates unto themselves, and thereby have obtained
the possession of the premises, and the same, and the profits thereof by the
space of xx years wrongfully have withholden and yet do, contrary to all right
and good conscience. In consideration whereof and for so much as your said poor
subject is in extreme misery and need, and not having wherewith to live, but
driven by necessity unto his daily labor, which he cannot intermit without the
utter undoing of him and all his children, and so of no manner of ability to sue
for the premises by your laws. It may therefore please your highness of your
most abundant grace and pity, to grant your most charitable and favorable
letters, or commission to be directed unto such honorable men as your highness
shall name thereunto, commanding them by the same to examine the premises,
and further to set such direction and final end therein, as justice and truth
would, and that as they will answer before the judgment of almighty God,
unto whom your said poor subject will according to his bounden duty, pray for
the preservation of your royal estate, etc.

A petition to the King for a poor Scholar. To the King our Sovereign etc.
Pleases it your highness of your most noble and abundant grace, in the way
of charity, for and toward the exhibition of your daily Orator and poor
suppliant T.M. master of Art, and stude^t in your university of O. being
minded to continue in his study and learning there, which he shall not be
able to do, unless your most gracious favor be showed him in this behalf, to
give and grant unto your said Orator, the pention going out of the College or
fellowship of N. being of your most noble foundation, which pention was lately
paid to A.B. master of art, who for that the said college was lately void of a
dean and mast, is by your grace to the same preferred and called. And that your
said Orator may upon this bil signed with your most gracious hand, have and
obtain such and as many your necessary writings, as in this behalf shall he to
him expedient. And your said orator shall daily pray to God for the preservation
of your royal estate long to continue in felicity.

A bill of complaint upon certain gifts, requiring a writ of Cerciorare.
IN most lamentable wise shows unto your good Lordship, your daily poor
orator I.W. of London, that were one A.H. of L. aforesaid merchant tailor
borrowed of your said orator xij. li sterling to be paid to the said I. at a
certain day between them agreed, which day was expired, and the said sum of
money not paid, wherefore the said A. for that he had not ready money,
desired your supplyant to take a certain white broad cloth in pawn, containing
xl. yards cut in pieces, for the said xij. li. which cloth was sold and
delivered to your said Orator by a bill of sale, wherein the said A.H. stands
bound with condition in the same bil declared, that if the said cloth were not
redeemed by a day certain in the same bill limited, that then the same cloth to
be to the only use of your said Orator for contentation and whole payment of
the said xij. li. Since the which time the said A. counseled your said Orator
to put forth the said cloth to one L.M of London shereman, for to be dyed of
several colors for his most profit, by the means whereof the said I.W. was
contented to take the said broad cloth for the paime^t of his said money, and
afterward the said cloth was delivered to the said L.M. and w^thin six days
after the delivery of the said cloth to the said L. one R. N. Spaniard,
affirmed a plaint of debt against the said A and according to the custom of
the said city of London, has caused attachment to be made of the said broad
cloth as the debt due by the said A. unto the said R. where the said cloth is
your said Orators. Notwithstanding, by reason of the said Attatchment, your
said orator retained Counsel in the Guild hal of London, where the matter was,
being at issue, whereupon the Jury was panelled, since the which time for the
space of three Court days, your said orator did give attendance there to have
the said matter heard, and the said plaintiff and counsel would not suffer the
said Jury to appear, so long as your said suppliant did apply and pursue his
cause in effect herein. And for that the said R. his counsel would not proceed
in the said action, your said orator supposed that it should no more be called
upon, by occasion whereof your said Orator being about his business in the
Country, in the mean time the said L.M with his counsel having knowledge that
your said Orator was out of the city, and in the country, instantly labored
the Jury to appear in the absence of your said Orator, and by their subtlety
and craft the said Jury did appear and passed against your said Orator,
contrary to all right, law, and good conscience, which shall be to the great
impouerishment and undoing of your said orator for ever, unless your good
Lordships lawful favor and succor be to him showed in this behalf. In
consideration whereof, might it therefore please your good Lordship to grant the
kings writ of Cerciorare, to be directed to the Mayor and Shirifes of the city
of L. commanding them and every of them by virtue of the same to certify
before your good Lordship in the kings most Honorable Court of the Chancerie,
at a certain day by your Lordship to be limited, the said attachment and all
the matter concerning the same, and to examine the said matter and all the
whole circumstances thereof, and to stand to such an order and direction
therein, as shall stand with right, equity, and good conscience. And your said
orator shall pray to God for the preservation of your good Lordship long to
continue.

A Bill of complaint for the right of lands, where a state was made by deceit,
and to require a Subpena upon the same.
MOst humbly showing unto your Lordship your daily orator W.L. of W. in the
county of M. That where one W.L. late of S. in the cou^ty of K. by his lifetime
was lawfully seized in his demean as of fee, of, and in one mesuage and seven
acres of land, set, lying and being in the Town and field of S. aforesaid, to
the yearly value of xx. s.^ sterling. And he so seized of the premises had
issue one I.L. his son, and dyed, after whose death the said I. was distract
and of no whole memory, and so dyed without issue of his body lawfully beg^tten
After whose death the said mesuage and other the premises descended and came
unto one I L^as br^ther and heir unto the said W.L. which I has issue one
T.R. his son. And so it is my good ^^rd that as well the said I. the father, as
also the said This son has by their deed of release, released all their
right, title, and interest, of and in the said mesuage and other the premises
to your said Orator and his heirs, as by their said deed of release does
appear: All that notwithstanding good Lord, certain evidences, deeds,
charters, writings, and muniments concerning the premises, be come to the
hands and possession of one W. S who by reason of having of the same evidences,
has conveyed Indentures of a bargain and sale of the premises from the said
W.T. being a distract man and of no wit, unto the said S. which S. by force of
the same, and by having the evidence in his custody, has conveyed diverse
secret estates to the use of the said, S. and his heirs, by the supportation,
counsel, and maintenance of one W. N and I.T. against all law, right, and
good conscience, and by the confederacy and supportation of the said W. and T.
the said S. W. with his extort power does wrongfully deteine and keep the
possession in the premises from your said orator against al right and good
justice. In tender consideration whereof, it may please your Lordship to give
thereupo^ the kings writ of Subpena to be directed to the before named S.W.W.
and I.T. commanding the^ and every of them by the same, personally to appear
before your Lo. in the K. court of Cha^cery at a certain day to the^ limited,
and under a certain pain, there to make answer to the premises. And
furthermore to stand to, and obey all such order and direction in ye premises,
as by your Lo. shall be ^hought most reasonable, according to right and good
Justice. And your Orator shall daily pray for the preservation of your good Lo.
long to endure.

A bill of Subpena for a title of lands intailed.
IN most humble wise shows and complains unto your good Lordship, your
daily Orator I.I. husbandman, That where one W. I. late of S. in the county of
W. husbandman, graundfather of your said orator was lawfully seized in his
demean as of fee, by due course of inheritance unto him lawfully descended
from his ancestors and other lawful conueyance in the law, of and in one
mesuage, and CCC. acres of land, meadows, wood, and pasture with their
appurtenances in S. aforesaid. And the said W.I. so being of the premises
seized about lviij. years now past, It was condescended, granted, and agreed
between the said W. I. and one I. E. late of Hamptoncurlew in the said county
deceased, that A. I. then son and heir apparent of the said W.I. before a
certain day should marry and take to his wife one A.E. daughter of the said
I.E. And that the said W.I. in consideration thereof, and for that the said A.
should be greatly advanced and preferred in goods and substance by that marriage
of the said A. would immediately after the said marriage had and solemnized,
convey and make unto the said A. and Agnes, a good, sufficient, and lawful
estate in the law, of, and in the said mesuage, lands, tenements, and other
the premises: To have and to hold unto the laid A. and Agnes, and to their
heirs males of their bodies lawfully begotten. And afterward the said A.
according to the said agreement did marry and take to wife the said A. E.
immediately after which marriage had and solemnized, the said W.I according to
his said promise and agreement did lawfully enfeoffe, of, and in the said
mesuage, lands, tenements, and other the premises the said A. I. and A. then
his wife, to have and to hold unto the same A. and A. and to his heirs maies
of their two bodies lawfully begotten, by force whereof the said A. and A. were
seized, of, and in the premises in their demean as of see tail special, and
they so being thereof seized, the said A. and Agnes had issue male between them
lawfully begotten one I.I. and your said Orator, and one W.I and the said W.I.
the elder died, by and after whose death the reuersion in fee simple of the
premises descended unto the said A. as son and heir unto him: And afterward
the said A. and Agnes dyed, after whose death the said message, lands,
tenements, and other the premises descended and came, and of right ought to
descend and come unto the said I.I. as son and heir male of the body of the
said A. and A. lawfully begotten: by force whereof the said I. I. entered into
the said mesuage, lands, tenements, and other the premises, and was thereof
seized in his demesne as of fee rail special, And he so being thereof seized,
the said I. I. about 4. years now past, of the said mesuage and other the
premises dyed seized without any issue male of his body lawfully begotten, by
force whereof the said mesuage and other the premises descended and came, and
of right ought to descend and come unto your said poor orator, as brother and
heir male to the said I.I. by the virtue of the gift aforesaid. So is it my
singular good Lord, that as well the deed of entaile made of and in the
premises by the said W.I. the graundfather unto the said A.I. and Agnes, and
to the heirs males of their bodies lawfully begotten, as is aforesaid, as
diverse other charters, euide^ces, deeds, writings, and muniments, concerning
the premises, proving the said interest and title of your said orator, in and
to the premises be deceitfully come to the hands and possession of I.W. and E.
his wife, late wife of the said I.I.G.W. gent. and T.S. the elder, and thereas
they have conveyed and put them, and by color of having of the said evidences,
deeds, writings, and muniments in their hands and possession, the same I.W. and
E. have now of late wrongfully entered into the said mesuage, and other the
premises, And the possession thereof do so yet wrongfully deteine and keep
from your said Orator, and also the rents, issues, and profits thereof have
wrongfully received, perceived, and taken to their own use, by the space of
four years past, and so yet do contrary to all right and good conscience, And
albeit that your said orator has often and sundry times required, and
instantly desired the said I. W.E. G. W. and T. S as well to deliver unto your
said orator the said evidences, deeds, writings, and miniments, concerning the
premises, as also to avoid the possession of the premises, and peaceably and
quietly to permit and suffer your said orator and his assigns to have and
enjoy the same, and to receive and take the rents and profits thereof to his
own use, according to his said interest, and the title therein, which to do
they at all times have refused and denied, and yet do, contrary to all right
and good conscience. And for as much as your said orator knows not the
number, contents ne other certainties of the said evidences, deeds, writings,
and miniments, nor wherein they be contained. And also for that the said John
W. E. G.W. and T. S. be of great substance and riches, and also greatly
friended and borne in the said county of Warwick. And your said orator being
but a poor man, and having but few friends in the said county, the same your
said orator is and shall be therefore without remedy concerning the premises,
by the due course and order of the common law, and otherwise, unless your good
Lordships aid and favor be unto him showed in this behalf. In consideration
whereof it may please your good Lordship (the premises tenderly considered) to
grant unto your said orator the kings most gracious several writs of Subpena,
to be directed unto the said I.W.E.G.W. and T.S. commanding them and every of
them by the same, personally to appear before the K. in his most honorable
court of Chancery, at a certain day, and upon a certain pain by your good
Lordship to be limited therein, and there to make answer to the premises, and
further to be ordered therein, as shall accord with right and good conscience.
And your said Orator shall daily pray etc.

The answer of I.W. to the bill of complain of John I husbandman.
THe said defendant says, that the said Bill of complaint is uncertain and
insufficient in the law to be answered unto, and the matter therein contained
untrue, and principally imagined and pursued by the unlawful procurement,
bearing and supportation of one W.C. Esquire, to the intent to put the said
defenda^t to trouble, costs and expenses, intending thereby so to unquiet and
impouerish the said defend. as they should be feign to leave their right,
title, and interest, of, and in the premises, so that he the said W.C. might
purchase and buy the same of the said complainant, and of late the said W. C.
has made means unto the said I.W. now defe^da^t to buy his title and interest
of, and in the premises and threatened him to have the same, and that if he
would not let him have it with his good will, that then he would have it
against his will, whosoever took his part, and if the contents of the said
bill were true, as they are not, it were then matter determinable at the Common
law, and not in this honorable court, whereunto the said defenda^t prays to be
released. And nevertheless, the advantage of the premises unto this defendant
at all times saved, for further answer unto the said bil, and declaration of
the truth of the contents of the said bill, the said defendants say, and every
one of them says, that long time before the said A.I. mentioned in the said
bill of complaint, any thing had in the said mesuage and other the premises,
for that the said W. I. was therefore infeoffed, T. I. of P.T.S. of S. and T.W.
of E. were thereof seized in their demeanes as of see, and so being thereof
seized, by their writing indented ready to be showed, the same mesuage and
other the premises contained in the said bil of complaint amongst other
things, gave, demised, delivered, and by their said writing indented, confirmed
unto the said W. I. mentioned in the said bill of complaint, and unto Agnes his
wife: To have and to hold the said mesuage and other the premises unto the
said W. and A. for term of their lives, and the life of the longer liver of
them, and after their decease, the said T.T. and T. willed and declared in the
said writing inde^ted, that the said mesuage, and al other the premises,
should remain unto the said A. mentioned in the said bil of complaint, and unto
A. his wife, and unto the heirs and assigns of the said A. for ever, without
that, that the said W.I. did infeoffe, of and in the said mesuage, lands,
teneme^ts, and other the premises, the said A. and Agnes, to have to the^ and
to their heirs males of their two bodies lawfully begotten, or that the said
A. and Agnes were seized of, and in the premises in their demeans as of fee
tail especial, as in the said bil of complaint is surmised, and without that,
that after the death of the said W. that the remainder of the premises in fee
simple disce^ded unto the said A. as son and heir unto him, or that after
the death of the said A. and Agnes, the said mesuage and other the premises
disce^ded, and of right ought to disce^d or come unto the said I.I. in the
tail especial, as son and heir male of the body of the said A. and Agnes
lawfully begotten, either of any other descent of inheritance therein of a mere
fee simple, or that the said I. by his entry into the said mesuage, and other
the p^misses, after the death of his father and mother, was the^ seized of, and
in his demean as of fee tail especial, or of any such estate died seized, or
that after the death of the said I. that the said mesuage and other the
premises, or any part or parcel thereof descended and came, or of right ought
to descend and come to the said co^pl. as brother and heir male to the said
I.I. by virtue of any gift or otherwise, as in the bill of complaint is untruly
surmised: But the said defenda^ts do aver, and are, and shall be at al times
ready to prove, as this honorable Court shall award, that the said mesuage and
al other the premises, by and immediately after the death of the said I.I.
descended, and of right oght to disce^d and come unto one A. daughter and heir
of the said I. lawfully begotten on the body of the said E. one of the def.
the which A. is yet in plein life, and in the ward and custody of her said
mother, and without that, that any deed of tail made of, and in the bill by
the said W.R. the grandfather, or any other evidence, deeds, writings, or
munime^ts concerning the premises, proving the said interest and title of the
said complainant, of and in the premises, and every part or parcel thereof be
comen into the hands and possession of the said I.W. and E. his wife, or either
of them, or to the custody or possessions of any other by their delivery,
conueyance, or appointment: but truth it is that the said def. have in their
custody one writing indented, ready to be showed, whereby the remainder of the
premises is conveyed unto the said A. and Agnes his wife, and to the heirs
and assigns of the said A. for ever, as is aforesaid, and diverse other
evidences and writings, proouing and concerning the conueiance of the fee
simple of the said mesuage, and other the premises, unto the said A. and other
his ancesters, the which charters, evidences and writings, the said def. do
still with them detain and keep, as good and lawful is for them to do, as well
for the proof and preservation of their right, title and interest unto the
third part of the premises, for the dowry of the said E. as for the said A.
daughter and heir to the said I of, and in the said mesuage and other the
premises, and without that, that the said def. have at any time wrongfully
entered into the mesuage and other the premises, or into any part thereof, or
the profits thereof do wrongfully detain and keep from the said
complainants, or the rents, issues, and profits thereof have wrongfully
restrained, received and taken to their own use, as in the same bill is also
untruly surmised etc.

A Bill of complaint in the Chancery for a debt without a specialtie.
IN most humble wise shows and complains unto your good Lordship, your
daily Orator and poor beadman, I, G. of H. in the county of D. that where the
said I. G. by way of pressed at the feast of Pentecost, in the xxiiij year of
the reign of our sovereign Lord the king that now is, did deliver unto one
W.L. late of H. in the County of D. the sum of xviij. li. of lawful money
of England, to be paid unto him at the feast of S. A. then next ensuing, before
which day the said W.L. by his last will and testament, constituted and made
one E. then his wife his executrix, of his own proper goods (all his debts
paid) to the sum of one C. pound, whom your said Orator, sundry and many
times has required payment of the said xviij. pound, which to content and pay
the said E. did never utterly deny, but did require respite for the payment of
the same, and before the said E. did content and pay any penny of the said
xviij. pound, the said E. in her death bed, by her last will and testament, did
constitute and make one I. S. her son her executor and dyed, and left to him
sufficient of the goods of the said W. for the contentation and payment of the
same xviij pound, and after dyed, sithen whose death the said complainant
daily, sundry, and many times required the said I. S. to content and pay unto
him the said sum of xviij. pound, which to do he has at all times refused
and yet does, contrary to right and good conscience, to the utter undoing of
your poor Orator for ever. And for because your Orator has no specialtie,
whereby he should charge the executor of the executrix of the said W.L. he is
therefore without remedy by the order of the common law of this Realm, and is
like utterly to lose the said xviij. pound, unless your gracious favor be to
him showed in this behalf. In tender consideration whereof, it may therefore
please your good Lordship, (the premises considered) to grant the Kings writ
of Subpena, to be directed to the said I. S. commanding him by the same
personally to appear before your good L. in the kings etc.

The answer to the same bill.
THe said I.S. by protestation not knowing that the said complainant did
deliver the said W. L. in the said bill named, the sum of xviij l. or any
part thereof by way of pressed, as in the said bill is furmised, he further
says, that the bill of complaint is uncertain and insufficient in the law to
be answered unto, and much of the matter therein contained is feigned and
imagined for vexation and trouble of the said I.S. the advantage thereof to him
at all times saved. The said I.S. for further answer unto the said bill says,
that long time before the laid E.L. was constitute and made executrix unto the
said W.L. she was married unto one I.S. father of this defendant by the space
of xx. years and more, which said I. S. by his last will and testament
constituted, ordained, and made the said E. and the said I.S. his executors and
died, and left to the order and disposition of his said executors goods and
cattels of his own proper to the value of 200. pounds sterling and above: All
which the said goods and cattels, for the most part of the same, being and
remaining in the hands and custody of the said E. she the same E. married and
took to husband the said W.L. which said W. after the marriage had between him
and the said E. did mispend, wast, and consume of the said goods and cattels,
late of the said I.S. to the value of 140. l. sterling, and above: And
afterward the said W.L. by his last will and testament ordained and made the
said E. executrix thereof, and died a very poor man, having no manner goods nor
cattels at the time of his death of his own proper to the value of xx. s.
sterling. And afterward the said E. by her last will ordained this def.
exechtor thereof and died, sithence whose death there has not comen to the
hands of this def. of the goods late the said W. L. to the value of xx. s.
sterling, without that, that the said W.L. at his death left unto the said E.
of his own proper goods, to the sum of an C. l. over his debts paid, or yet
the sum of xx. s. sterling, or that the said E. after the death of the said
W.L. did ever consent, or agree to pay the said xviij l. unto the said
complainant, or did require him to respite the payment thereof, or that the
said E. at the time of her death left unto the debtee, sufficient of the goods
of the said W. L. for the contentation and payment of the said xviij. l. as in
the said bill of complaint untruly is surmised, and without that, that any
other thing comprised in the said fained bill of the foresaid I. S. which is
material to be answered unto, and in this answer not confessed, avoided, or
trauersed is true. All which matters the said I. S. is ready to auerre, as this
honorable Court shall award, and prays to be dismissed with his reasonable
costs and charges in this behalf sustained etc.

Another form of a bill for a Subpena.
IN most humble wise shows and complains unto your good Lordship, your
poor and daily Orator I. A. of R. in the county of N. that where one W. H.
late of London Draper, was seized in his demean as of fee, of and in one
mesuage, and xx. acres of land, wood, and pasture, set, lying, and being in the
town and fields of R. and the said W. so being seized of the premises at L.
aforesaid by protestation thereof died seized, after whose death the premises
descended, and of right ought to descend unto your said Orator, as to the uncle
and next heir of the said W. H. deceased, that is to say, brother of W. H.
father of the said W. deceased: So it is right honorable Lord, that since the
death of the said W. diverse and sundry evidences, deeds, charters, writings,
and other muniments concerning the premises, be commen to the hands and
possessions of R. H. etc. who by the color of having of the said euide^ces,
have unlawfully entered into the premises, and thereof have taken the profits to
their own uses, by the space of vij. years last past, without having any just
color of title so to do. And albeit that your said Orator has diverse times
since the death of the said W. required the delivery of all the said evidences
of the said R. H. and every of them: that notwithstanding, they and every of
them the same to deliver, have always denied, and yet do deny, contrary to all
laws, equity, and good conscience: It may please therefore your good Lordship
(the premises considered) forasmuch as your said Orator for thobtaining of
those evidences has no remedy by course of the common Laws of this Realm,
for that he knows not the certain number of the said evidences wherein they
be contained, to grant unto your orator the kings most gracious writ of
Subpena to be directed to the foresaid R H. etc. commanding them and every of
them by the same personally to appear etc.

A bill of complaint where a Quest has passed in a matter wrongfully alleged.
IN most humble wise shows and complayneth unto your most honorable good
Lordshippe, your poor suppliant and continual Orator P W of the city of
London Broker, That whereas one A M. of the said city Merchant stranger, within
the said city was possessed of and in certain linne^ clothes, to the value of
xxij. l. x. s. sterling, and to your poor suppliants knowledge, then as yet,
of his own mere proper goods and cattels, and so thereof being possessed, the
same within the said city delivered to your poor orator being a broker,
safely to keep and to sell and merchandise, by the discretion of your poor
suppliant, to the use of the said A. by force whereof your orator made sale
thereof to certain persons within the same city, and the money, goods, and
merchandise therefore received and taken, delivered unto the said A. And so it
is, right honorable Lord, that after and since the sale thereof made, one I. S.
Merchant stranger, pretending a property in the foresaid linen clothes, has
commenced an action upon the case against your poor suppliant in the Guild
hall, set and being within the foresaid city before the Shirifs, therefore and
thereupon has declared that the said I. should have lost those goods, and that
they came to the hands and possession of your poor suppliant within the said
City by way of trouer. And furthermore that your orator was sundry times
required to make deliverance thereof to the said I. and that refused, and the
same afterward sold, and the money thereof received, converted to your orators
use: to which matter one I. O. your poor suppliants Attorney rashly without
aduisement or counsel therein taken, said that your said Orator did not sell
the said clothes, nor any part thereof, and upon the same matter whether any
sale thereof was made by your suppliant or not, an issue was taken and the Jury
tried, sworn, and charged, found a sale made by your poor orator of the said
clothes (as the truth was) nothing regarding in whom the property of the
goods was at the time of the sale thereof made, because by the plee so
unadvisedly pleaded, it was confessed in point of judgment, the property
thereof to be to the said I. S. and so it is right honorable Lord, that the
said Attorney might have taken an issue, that your orator sold no clothes of
the said I. because of truth the clothes were the proper clothes of the said A.
and not the clothes of the said I. and so the Jury should have tried in whom
the property was, and because the property was not put in issue, the Jury had
no warrantie to enquire thereof. And in case they had been the clothes of the
said I. as they were not indeed, your poor orator ought not by the order of
the law to have bin charged, because they were delivered to your orator by the
hands of the foresaid A. to sell, and your orator did accordingly, and the
money, goods, and marchandizes thereof received, delivered to the said A. and
so if any trespass or wrong was done to the said I. it was done by the said A.
and not by your poor Orator against who^ the said A. may take his actio^: for
your poor orator at the time of the said action commenced, neither had the
said goods in his possession ne any other thing in lieu or considerance of the
same goods. And also there is a custom within the said city, that if any
vpholster or broker, sell any goods within the same city, to any person or
persons within the same city, upon the delivery of any person, for, or at the
request of him, having witness of the delivery thereof to him made or bring
out the party who delivered them unto him, not being himself particeps
criminis, should be discharged and not damnyfied, for his office doing in
making sale thereof. And also by the order of the common Law of this Realm a
man coming immediately to the possession of goods not being party to the first
wrong, shall not be charged in action of trespass, which matters or any of them,
if they had bin pleaded, had bin a sufficient matter of bar, and because they
were not pleaded, your poor suppliant could not be received to give them in
evidence to the Iurye, and so your poor orator is like to pay unto the said I.
the value of the said clothes, the said I having no proper right ne title to
the same, unless your most honorable good Lordships favor be showed herein. In
consideration whereof, it may please your most honorable good Lordship (the
premises tenderly considered) to grant the K. most gracious writ of
Cerciorare to be directed to the shirifes of the said city, commanding them and
every of them to certify before your good Lo. the whole record of the
premises depe^ding before the^, or either of them in the R. most gracious
court of Chauncery at a certain day by your good Lordship to be limited and
therein further to proceed, and further to grant the Kings most gracious and
speedy writs of Subpena to be directed to the said I. commanding him
personally to appear before your good Lordship in the Kings said Court of
Chancery at certain day, and under a certain pain by your good Lordship to be
limited therein to stand to the premises, and further to take such direction,
order and decree therein, as may stand with equity, justice, and good
conscience, and your poor Orator shall daily pray to almighty God for the
prseruation of your most honorable good Lordships estate long to endure.

which before us upon the holy Evangelists of God sworn, said, deposed, and
affirmed, that the said Testament or last will was written with the proper hand
of the same E.M. And also that he heard the same E. in her life say diverse
times, that S. F. late Alderma^ of the said City of London, T. H. gent. and R.
T. Mercer, were infeoffed in all her lands and tenements, and she said that the
said R. T. should have, and with them do, like as he would do of his own
lands and tenements by him purchased. In witness whereof to these presents,
the seal of our office of Mairalty of the said city, we have done to be put
to. Written at London the x day of Feb. the year of the reign of our
sovereign Lord king Henry the viij. etc.

A good President of a Testament.
IN the name of God Amen. The xxj. day of the month of May, the year of our
lord God 1589. etc. I R: N. Mercer, citizen of L. being of whole mind, and in
good and perfect remembrance, laud and praise be unto almighty God, make and
ordeine this my present Testament, concerning herein my last Will, in manner and
form following: that is to say. First I commend my soul unto almighty God, my
maker and Redeemer, and my body to be buried in the parish Church, or

will that in all such debts and duties as I owe of right or of conscience to
any person or persons, be well and truly contented and paid by mine executors
hereafter named, or else ordained for to be paid without any delay or
co^tradiction. And after my debts paid, and my funeral expenses performed, I
will that all my goods, cattels, and debts, shall be divided into 3. equal
parts, whereof I will that Anne my wife shall have one equal part to her own
proper use, in manner of her purpart and reasonable part to her of all my said
goods, cattels and debts, after the laudable custom of the city of London
belonging. And the second equal part of all my said goods, cattels, and debts,
I bequeath to E. and M. my daughters, and to the child now being in the womb of
my said wife, equally to be divided amongst the^, and to be delivered unto them
when they shall accomplish and come to their lawful ages of xxi. years, or
else be married etc. And if it fortune any of my said children to decease before
they accomplish their said ages, and before that time be not married, that the^
I bequeth her part, or his part, of them so deceasing, to the other of them
then suruiuing, to be delivered unto them when they shall accomplish their said
ages, or else be married, and if it fortune all my said children to decease (as
God it defend) before they accomplish their said ages, and before that time be
not married, then I bequeth as well all and singular the said part and portion of
my said children in my foresaid goods cattels, and debts, as also my legacy to
them hereafter bequethed to and amongst the children lawfully begotten of the
body of R. M. of S. in the county of R. to be paid and delivered to them at
like ages, and in like manner as is appointed unto my own children, and every
child likewise to be others heir thereof. And if it shall fortune all the
children of the said R. M. of his body lawfully begotten, to decease (which Go^
^efe^d) before they come to their lawful ages, and before that time be not
married, the^ I will that all their said parts and portion of my said goods,
catels, and debts, shall wholly be employed and bestowed in amending and
repairing of noyous highwayes, nigh about the city of London, and to the
marriage of poor maidens by the discretion of mine executors, and overseers, if
they were then living, or else by the discretions of the Lord Mayor and his
brethren the Aldermen of the city of London. And the third equal part of all
my said goods, carels, and debts, I reserve unto mine executors. therewith to
perform my legacies and bequests hereafter specified, that is to wit: First I
bequeath to my mother in law mistress A. C. a jewel of the value xx. li. Item I
bequeath xxx. li. to be distributed shortly after my decease to and amongst the
poor householders inhabiting within the said parish of S. N. by the discretion
of mine executors and overseers Item I bequeath unto the poor prisoners in all
the prisons and gailes of London and S. x. li. sterling. to be equally divided
amongst them, by mine executors. Item I bequeath unto R L. x. li. and a gown.
Item I bequeath to P F. my servant x, li. in the intent that he shall instruct
mine executors faithfully and truly in all my recknings and business. Ite^ I
bequeath to A. B. a black gown. Ite^ I bequeath unto the Masters, Wardeins,
and fellowship of ye Mercers 6. li. for a recreation or a diner amongst them
that shall be in their livery at my burial. Item I bequeath unto every one of
my servants that shall be in my house and service at the time of my decease a
gown. Item I bequeath unto the said A. my wife 90. li. of my said portion, to
the intent and upon condition that she in her widowhood by her deed sufficient
in the law shall clearly remit and release al her right, title, and interest
that she then shall have or ought to claim or have, by reason of her marriage
unto me, to, of, and in all and singular my lands and tenements, and other
their appurtenances, set, lying and being within the county of E. a^^ elsewhere
within the Realm of England. And in case my said wife then refuse so to do,
and not so release, that then as now, and now as then, I will that my said
legacy so made unto her of the said lxxxx. li. shall be void and of none
effect. Item I will that my said wife shall inhabit and have mine house wherein
I now dwell, in the said parish of S. N. during her widowhood, and as soon and
when as she shall be assured or married to any other man, that then I will that
the lease and term of years, of and in the same, shall be sold to the most
price and furtherance that can be to the profit of my said children. The
residue of all my goods, cattels, and debts, after my debts paid, my funeral
expenses performed, and these my legacies contemed in this my present testament
fulfilled, I wholly give and bequeath to my said children, equally to be divided
amongst them, and to be delivered unto them according as I have above willed
and declared, that their said own portions shall be. Provided always, and it
is my very will, mind and intent, that shortly after my decease, all and
singular my wares, stuff of household, plate, and all other my goods whatsoever
they be, shall be prised by two indifferent persons to be named and sworn by
the Lord Mayor of London and his brethren for the time being. And all and
singular the portions thereof appertaining to my said children, as well my second
part as my said legacy so to them made and bequeathed of my part, immediately
after the apprising to be ordered according to the custom of the orphanage of
the city of London by the L. Mayor and brethren. Ite^ I will that the young me^
being free of the fellowship of Mercers of London, shall have the occupying of
all my said childrens portions and legacies, during their nonages, they putting
in sufficient suerties therefore, according to the said custom of the city of
London. And I will, and my mind and intent is, that master H. L. and master R.
M. or their assigns shall have the keeping, governance, and bringing up of my
said children, during their nonages. And of this my present testament, I make
and ordain the said A. my wife, and the said Master H. and R. mine executors.
And I bequeath to either of them for their labor in that behalf xx. li. and a
black gown. And of the execution of the same, I make and ordain the said
master L. O. ouerseer. And I utterly revoke and adnull all and every other
former testaments, wills, legacies, bequests, executors, and overseers, by me
in any wise before this time made, named, willed, and bequeathed: These
witnesses etc.

The manner of making a supplication upon breaking of promise, and such like.
IN most humble wise shows unto your mastership, your poor Orator W. V. of
etc. that where one R. M. etc. faithfully promised to deliver to your said
Orator, in marriage with one A. S. his daughter, now the wife of your said
beadman, all manner household stuff necessary for household, before sufficient
witness ready to testify the same, to be delivered immediately after the said
marriage: Whereupon your said orator married with the said A. fithens which time
(right honorable Sir) your said orator has required the same stuff, which the
said W. has always promised, nevertheless, for the space of xv. years past
has deferred with fained promises the delivery thereof, to the great unquiet
and hinderance of your said orator, which now is compelled to require the
charitable help and aid of your good Mastership herein. In consideration
whereof it would please your accustomable goodness always to poverty
extended, to do call before you the same R. M. and him to cause to recompense
and content your said Orator, as well for the said household stuff, or to
deliver the same, as also for his loss of great time and hinderance thereabout
expended: Your said Orator should according to his bounden duty etc.

Another upon disceit by a partner.
IN most humble wise complaining shows unto your good Lordship, your daily
Orator etc. That whereas upon the imagination of honest and good opinion R. C.
Father unto your said orator deceased, had in one T. T. etc. the said R. about
Easter last past, did join in bargain with the said T. T. for the delivery of
so much wares, whereof the moitie was to the said R. as amounted to the sum
of etc. unto one I. S. of the kings Majesty's household Esquire, for the which
sum of etc. the said S. stood bound by statute of the Staple, unto the said R.
C. and T. T. payable at the feast of etc. then next etc. which was in the year
of our sovereign L. King Henry the etc. And to the intent that the same K.
being a man of such honesty and simplicity, as did neither suspect, nor yet
misdoubt the good conscience of the said C. who alwais toward him had
counterfaited such purity of conscience, and so honest behavior, might the
better by the help of the same T. come by his debt at the time to be due, if he
so long lived, or else if he died, that the said T. might be a stay and sure
means to his executors for the getting in of the same: He the same R. trusted
the said T. with the custody of the said statute: Soon after the making of
which bargain, and somewhat before the said least of etc. the said R.
deceased, and made your orator his executor thereof, by charging him as well with
the gathering in of al such sums of money as were due to the said testator,
as also with the paunent of all such debts as the said R. did owe. And so it is
most gracious Lord, that although your said beseechour has diverse and sundry
times since the decease of his said father, required the said T. to have the
moitie of the said etc. due to him by equity and conscience, as executor unto
his said testator. The said T. (now declaring him what he is) having no regard
either to conscience, common honesty, nor yet to the trust he was put in,
minding if he can (with what injury he cares not) utterly to debar your
said Orator from the having thereof, and he himself against al reason and
conscience, to have the said etc. for nothing: has not only with many slight
and subtle delays, lyngred and fooded your said Orator of long time from
having the same, but aso now lately has plainly answered and affirmed, that
your said Orator shall have no part nor penny thereof, which if it should thus
pass, should be both great encouraging to such corrupt conscioned persons
still to persevere in such their lewd demeanor, and in the mean time, turn to
the great impouerishing of your said poor orator. Wherefore may it please your
honorable L. of your accustomed equity, to inioyn the said T. that he repay
unto your said Orator the said etc. moitie of the said etc. if he have received
it of the said S. or if he have not, that he be no let to your said Orator to
do therein what he can for the obtaining and getting in of the same. And thus
shall your said orator have cause continually to pray for the prosperous estate
of your good L. long to endure.

A Bill of complaint made for the recovering of evidence made by compulsion.
IN most humble wise complaining shows unto your good Lordship, your daily
oratrix I. B. That whereas in the year etc. it chanced the husband of your said
oratrix, together with one etc. jointly and severally to be bounden in a
Recognisance of the sum of etc. knowledged before your good Lordship in the
Kings Malesties court of Chancery for the payment of etc. payable at a certain
day now past, unto one etc. for which sum not being paid at the day due, the
said etc. has sued execution against your said poor oratrices husband,
whereupon he was by the Shirife of etc. arrested about etc. past, and by all
the said space, has remained in the Kings Majesty's prison of Marshalsey, to
his great pain of body, importable charges, and in a manner undoing both of him,
your poor oratrix, and their small children, which piteous estate of his (with
himself lamenting) after he had well considered, he then consulted with
himself for his best remedy in that behalf, and therewithal calling to his
mind, that he had herein etc. a kinsman and cousin called etc. being of etc.
unto whom your said or atrices husband, for the vicinitie of blood and ability
of substance, was bolder to make his moan for help in this his adversity,
than unto any other, but far contrary his expectation, and against all
humanity, whence your said oratrices poor husband looked most after succor,
thence he received not only least help, but also most hurt: for the said etc.
well perceiving the adverse estate that your Oratrices poor husband was, and is
in, which was the greedines of the Merchant for his money, the earnest thought
and care of your poor oratrix, and her poor children, and the great desire
that her said poor husband had (as any man would) of liberty and discharge of
trouble, would by no means promise his help unto her said poor husband
herein, unless he would be content to bargain and sell al his lands amounting to
the yearly rent of etc. unto him the said etc. for an annuitie of xx. l.
sterling, to him during his life, and for the sum of etc. whereof etc. to be
paid in hand: whereunto your said poor oratrices husband, through the
constraint of his said cause, was compelled to agree, and to enseale such
writings, as the said etc. not long after had brought with him, concerning the
said bargain, nothing misdoubting of the said etc. being his cousin, but that
he should have seized to none other covenants, but only to such as conscience
would stand with: at which time the same etc. neither paid nor proffered any
penny of the said etc. according to his covenant: Which delay of payment both
against his promise and covenant, after her said poor husband had considered
and studied upon, and therewithal read over the covenants comprised in the
said Indentures of this bargain, which indeed (most honorable Lord) were so
parcially devised for the behoof of the said etc. and again so sore against
your said poor oratrices husband, as (if the bargain had taken effect) had
bin to the utter undoing of him and her, with all their heirs for ever, your
said poor oratrices husband taking hold on that point, that the said etc. paid
not the foresaid etc. did at their next meeting, renounce and say, that he
would not stand to the said covenants and bargain, whereunto the said etc.
partly knowing in that he had not paid nor proffered this etc. said before
sufficient witness here ready to be sworn, he was contented: howbeit he said
that your said oratrices poor husband should pay for the making of the
writings: For the payment whereof her said husband as then having no great
store of money, was feign to give him a gold ring in pledge to paythe scribe
for writing of the same. All this notwithstanding (most honorable Lord) and
that your said poor oratrices husband has often and sundry times since by
many ways and means required the said writings concerning the said bargain of
the said etc. he against all natural love and humanity, nothing more coveting
than the extreme destruction of her and her said poor husband, and well
perceiving how far he is now unable to help himself, has utterly denied to
render the same, and yet does, contrary to all conscience, equity, law, or
right: In consideration whereof, may it like your honorable Lordship of your
accustomed pity, to call the said etc. before you together with the husband of
your said poor oratrix, and there to will him to deliver the said writings
again to the said husband, if it shall seem unto your honor, or else there to
show sufficient matter why he should keep the same, and your said oratrix with
her poor husband, and their poor children shall pray etc.

A bill of a title of Copihold lands.
HVmbly complaining, shows unto your good Lordship, your daily orator W. S.
otherwise named W. T. of L. cofin and heir of I. S. otherwise called I. M.
while he lived etc. That whereas your said Orator at your Lordships last
being, at etc. did exhibit unto you a certain bil of complaint, mentioning
therein that the foresaid I. S. otherwise called I. T. in his life time was
seized of and in certain Customarie lands and tenements, that is to say, of
and in etc. holding by Copy of Court roll of the manor, of which one T.L. then
was and yet is Lord. And that the same I. S. so being seized of the premises
afterward of like estate dyed thereof by protestation seized, after whose
death the said etc. with the appurtenances, and the right, title, use,
possession, and inheritance thereof descended and came, and of very right ought
to descend and come unto your said Orator, as cofin and next heir of the said
I. S. that is to say, the youngest son of I. youngest son and heir to the
same I. S. according to the ancient custom of the said manor: And that your
said orator had often and sundry times desired and prayed the said etc. that with
lawful warning unto the tenants of the said Lordshippe, a Court might be
holden at the said manor, by whose inquiry the title of your said orator
might be presented and found in the premises according as both justice, right,
and good conscience does require: Howbeit most honorable Lord, that
notwithstanding, forasmuch as the said etc. has kept the premises in his own
hand these many years past, and the profits and issues thereof coming, has
by the same space to his own proper use received and taken, and yet does, your
said poor orator could never get the same etc. to hold a court there, minding
thereby utterly disheriting unto your said poor Orator, of and in the
premises: until such time as your said most honorable Lordship, moved with
your accustomed love to justice, and pity toward poverty, vouchsafed to
grant unto him your benign letters, directed unto the said etc. willing him
thereby with lawful warning given unto the tenants of the said Lordship, to
summon and keep a Court of the said manor, for the trial of the right of
your said Orator in the premises: upon the receipt of which letters, the said
etc. summoned and kept a Court at his said Manor of etc. whereat upon the open
and plain declaration of your said Orators title, together with the
examination of diverse witnesses brought in by your said Orator for the said
title in the premises, and further upon the showing of much substantial and
ancient evidence, maintaining the same, the Homage therewith charged and
sworn, did present and find at the said etc. before I. S. Steward of the same
Court, that the foresaid I. S. was possessour, and held the premises by Copy
of Court roll according to the custom of the said Manor, and that also your
said Orator was cofin and heir to the same I. S. according to the custom of
the said manor, that is to say, son of I. younger son of etc. as by the
Copy of the same Court rolls ready to be showed more plainly may appear unto
your Lordship. After which presentment at the same Court it was agreed betwixt
the said Steward in the name of the said etc. and your said Orator, that if the
said etc. should not declare and show unto your said Orator, or to his learned
counsel at London, within one term then next ensuing, a better title and
interest to the foresaid premises, than your said Orator had then and there
already proved: that then your said Orator should have and enjoy the premises
to him and to his heirs, according to right, equity and good conscience, and
according to the custom of the said manor. But so it is most honorable Lord,
that although the said etc. (as he cannot) so has he not by the said space
proved any manner of title, or color of title to the premises, but only with
such and like fraudulent delays, he intends to weary your said poor orator
from the obtaining of the premises, and if he can disherite him from the same:
Wherefore may it please your good Lordship of your accustomable goodness always
to poverty extended, to grant unto your said Orator the Kings most gracious
writ of Subpena, to be directed to the said etc. commanding him by the same not
only to appear personally before your good Lordship in the high court of
Chancerie at a certain day, and under a certain pain by your good Lordship
therein to be limited, but also to permit and suffer your said orator
peaceably to have, hold, or occupy, possess, and enjoy the premises
aforesaid, and the profits and issues of the same, until such time as the same
etc. has duly approved better title to the premises than he has hitherto
done, and your said poor Orator shall pray etc.
