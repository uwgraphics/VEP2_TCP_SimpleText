The Distressed Pilgrim,
Who being in much Misery,
He serves the Lord most faitfully:
And repents for the things are past,
And prays for a Heavenly place at last.
The Tune is, Who can blame my VVoe; Or, I am a Jovial Bachelor.


I Am a Pilgrim poor and bare,
in trouble I am crossed,
And many a hard hap falls my share;
my Substance all is lost:
My misery there is no man knows,
so numberless they be;
Yet in the midst of all my Woes,
Let Patience work for me.
Pray understand, I once had Land,
with Corn and Cattle store,
But now it is gone out of my hand,
i am grown exceeding poor;
So poor indeed, there is few that will
relieve my misery:
But as I said before, so I say still,
let, etc.
My flattering Friends and Kinsfolks all,
whom I did daily feed,
Will not so much as turn aside,
to help my extreme need,
They Would rather seek to scoff and scorn,
and jeer my Poverty;
Although I am as one forlorn,
let, etc.
Patience is an Herb of Grace,
if a Man does use it well,
Twill lay a Stomach in short space
that does with Poison swell;
Twill cure a Madman of his Evil,
'Twill cause the Blind to see,
It will expel and vanquish the Devil;
let, etc.
NOw in the midst of all my Woes,
what shall I do or say?
Shall I despair in any case,
or make my self away?
No, no, not while this Vital Breath,
which the Lord God lended me;
Come Woe or Wealth, come Life or Death;
For a patient man I Will be.
As I do wander up and down
in sorrow, I am crossed;
From Place to Place, from Town to Town,
my Substance is all lost:
But yet I think within my self,
as I shall tell to ye,
Though God has taken all my Wealth,
yet patience works for me.
Give not your Friends and Kinsfolks never
your means while you do live;
For that has brought me to this care:
which makes my heart to grieve:
I gave them Goods and Cattle too,
as all my Neighbors see;
But now they don't regard my woe,
yet, etc.
The Devil he is busy still,
to bring me to his Bow;
But it is Gods hlessed Will,
patience does with me go,
And keeps me in the Fear of God,
for a second Job to be;
Although I taste of's Holy Rod,
yet, etc.
For to despair, it is a Foolishness,
it is God that is my stay,
Who gave me Life, and when be please
can take again away.
The Lord he suffered for my sins,
as the Scripture shows me;
God give me Grace to think on it,
and patience, etc.
Though i am in want and misery,
I hope God will be pleased
For to release this slavery,
in Heaven for to be eased:
It Is the bravest thing in the World
to suffer then I see;
And though i am poor and in distress,
yet, etc.
I hope my steadfast Faith is so,
i will not forsake my God;
Though Poverty has brought me low,
i will not forsake his Word.
It Is for sins I do confess,
he suffered on the Tree,
To Release poor Sinners from redness,
and eke from misery.
And now adieu unto the World,
with all my sorrows that are past,
And give every one Grace in the end
to enjoy a Heavenly Rest:
Because all things do fade away,
and vanish we do see,
God give us all his Grace I say,
to be Patient in misery.
