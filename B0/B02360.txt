The Constant Lovers Mortal Mistake.
While Phaons absence caused suspicion strange
In her who wondered that his love should change,
Her bloody knife a mortal blow did give her,
Startled here at he fell into the River,
His dream was fatal while her deep suspicion
Caused these poor souls to dye in this condition.
Tune of, Young Phaon.


YOung Phaon sat upon the brink
to view the silver stream,
He overtaken was with sleep
and fell into a dream.
He then beheld a sight most strange
the like he never did see
Phillis did stand with Knife in hand
and thus complained she.
Old wretched fate you now too late
show me my misery,
My Phaons gone so fair so young
now for him I must dye:
Why was I robbed and then she sobb'd
of my delightful bliss,
So soon that he could not give me
one smile or parting kiss.
While he did live he never did give
me cause to mourn or grieve,
His life is fled and he is dead
I perfectly believe.
Therefore will I make haste and fly
out of this world of pain,
With him so sweet I fain would meet
with him for to remain.
While him I miss no pain like this
no blessings can I meet,
Had I but died by his dear side
death I had counted sweet,
And there withal she soon did fall
by wounding her fair breast,
Oh! now quoth she I come to thee
she shrick'd and went to rest.
He heard this cry as she did dye
and thought it was her voice,
Whom he did love all souls above
in her he did rejoice.
He started then and strait fell in
he never more was seen,
Phillis he cried and then he died
was lost in that sweet stream.
It Is so^row great for to relate
these constant lovers cross,
Few in this wo^ld were ever whirld
into so great a loss.
Both terrified these Lovers dyed
and never were seen again,
In vain did he lament while she
was by her self thus slain,
The second part
to the same Tune.


The great mistake that she did make
because he did absent,
This mischief caused, for when she paused
on him she did lament.
Dispairing love did passion move
which proved to be extreme,
She gave deaths wound while he was drowned
nothing could them redeem.
You happy lovers then beware
that you do not miscarry,
Perchance they may abscent away
whom you would have always tarry,
Then have a care and don't despair
and hug not d^scontent,
When from you they do keep away
they by themselves lament,
In lovely H^mnes and Stratagems
they are singing forth your praise.
In hopes e're long there will belong
to them a Crown of Bays.
For to adorn their not forlorn
nor yet forsaken loves,
When Himey comes with sugar-plumbs
they bill like Turtle Doves.
And when they are strange their links and Ch^ins
are stronger then before,
For when they are taken in them again
they are fast for evermore.
Tho fallings out may breed some doubt
count my assertion true,
They do increase loves joys and peace
and passion does renew,
These are loves toys and lovers joys
sometimes to prove the heart,
Such charms they breed that I indeed
cannot to you impart.
Their grieves don't last, love with a blast
These seeming clouds disperse,
But where or when they meet again
their passions they rehearse.
One sigh alone joined with a groan
more Penetrates the breast,
Then twenty why in company
they pass it as a jest,
But secret tears tears produced by fears
and none do them oppose,
They work upon the melt^ng one
and prove their mortal foes.
