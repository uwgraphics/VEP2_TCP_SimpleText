The Westminster Frolic. Or, A Cuckold is a good man's Fellow.
A wanton Wife that loved a relishing Bit,
In Westminster the same then she did get;
And it is now concluded so together,
Her Husband must be fain to wear Bulls-feather.
But yet the youngster he did not do well,
Ah! silly Fool! that he must kiss and tell;
She may thank her self the business is so bad
Play with a man, never trust a tell tale lad.
Tune of, Hey boys slap goes she; Or, Alas poor thing!




IN Westminster there is a Wife,
a very noble Dame;
And she does live a merry life
with sporting Venus Game:
But yet her name I will conceal,
though she does backwards fall;
She does transgress her Marriage Bed,
and that spoils all
For she did cast a wanton eye
upon a lively Youth;
And you shall hear it by and by,
we tell it for a truth:
That with a youngman she did lie,
to sport, and backwards fall,
Pox take her Stease, they came too low,
and, that spoils all.
And many a day this Young Man came
with her to sport and play;
She was so fi^'d with her Gallant,
she could not say him nay;
He teu'd her soundly on the bed,
she cried, Lad have at all,
Strike up I say my noble Lad,
for that spoils all.
She did the Youngman so ensnare,
and said her hand was warm,
That he would mount to a full Careir;
I wish he took no harm:
She let him lie at Twick a Twack
when she did backwards fall,
The bones in her Stease they did crack,
and that spoiled all.




When i am in bed then come my Lad
the pleasure is so sweet;
We Will have a dish of buttered Eggs
when we again do meet:
Thou art good metal I am sure,
I will be at thy call;
Come on my dear and do not fear,
for that spoils all.
My bonny Lad never be sad,
with thee i will sport and play;
Never talk of half a Crown a week,
i will please thee every way:
Thoust never want while I have a C --
I will be at thy Call,
Never think upon t what will come on it,
for that spoils all.
But he had a soft place in his Crown,
as I will make appear;
To tell it all about the Town,
where he went every where,
That she in kindness did excel,
he had her at his call,
But he is a Clown to kiss and tell,
for that spoiled all.
Then it came unto her husband ear
how he had sported with his wife:
Now I am a Cuckold I do fear,
and must be all my life;
My Neighbor has so fo^ked me
he has had her at his call,
He has played too much above her knee,
and that spoiled all.
Before her face to her disgrace,
and her Husband too was there;
He did declare the very case,
that she was Market ware:
Before their Neighbors where they went
he spoke both some and all;
She made him to eat some Flesh in Lent,
and that spoiled all.
Then the poor contented silly man
he made no farther strife,
Though he must wear the Bull-feather
he is beholding to his wife;
She has Hornified his head so brave,
when she did backwards fall;
The Tell-Tale Lad was but a Knave,
for that spoiled all.
