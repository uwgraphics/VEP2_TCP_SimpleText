The Ladies Answer TO THAT Busie-Body, Who wrote the Life and Death of DU VALL.
I Will tell thee senseless Fool, who e're thou be,
Thou art a Thief, by far more base than he:
Du Vall a little Wealth did only take,
Which they who lost it, got perchance by Cheat.
Wealth, which poor Mortals heap they n'ere so fast,
Pitiless Death will take them from at last.
But, Thou unworthy to be called a Man,
Rather some Beast, or monst'rous African,
Would from our Ladies that Bright Honor have,
Which out-lives Us, and triumphs over the Grave.
Honor's a Thing too Sacred and Divine,
Once to be touched by such rude Hands as thine.
How dare thou blame such mild and generous Tears,
Or strive to blast their Pity with thy Jeers?
If they were sorry, 'twas not that their Thoughts
Approved his Crimes, or justified his Faults;
Yet so much Valor as the Prisoner had,
And so much Youth, might make a Tigre sad.
The greatest Lords that England now can vaunt,
Pitied him too, and begged his pardons grant:
But them thou dare not mention, it is thy fear
Their Swords should find thee out for all thy care;
Only poor Ladies, that have no defense,
Nothing to guard them, but their Innocence.
These thou pick'st out, their Arms are in their Eyes,
And Love (thou know) disdains so small a Prize;
Which makes thee bold, and glad to venture where
Thou think there is not the least room for fear.
This shows thy Narrow Soul, thy Little Merit;
This shows thou art all Gall, and have no Spirit.
Suppose 'twere true, that any Lady here
For the poor Criminal did shed a Tear;
Those for whose Beauty's we were wont to die,
We Would now adore for their Humanity;
And their relenting Hearts should bear no more
Those Marble Names their vigor got before,
I to thy cost would soon defend their Fame,
But Coward as thou art, thou hid'st thy Name.
Coward indeed! who can employ thy Pen
Only against Weak Women, and Dead Men.
