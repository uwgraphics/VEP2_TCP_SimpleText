His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Friday the
Sixteenth Day of April, 1697.
My Lords and Gentlemen,

At the Opening of the Session, I told you how Sensible I was of the
Difficulties to be Struggled with, which were of such a Nature, that I will
freely own the Hopes I had of Our being Able to overcome them were Founded only
upon the Wisdom and Zeal of so good a Parliament.

My Expectation has been fully Answered; You Entered upon the Business with so
much Cheerfulness, Proceeded so Unanimously, and have at last brought things to
such a Conclusion, That we may Hope to Carry on the War with Success, in Case
Our Enemies do not think it their Interest to Agree to an Honorable Peace: And
so Effectual a Provision being made for supplying the Deficiencies of former
Funds (which is the best Foundation for Reestablishing of Credit) I Doubt not
but in a short time it will have a very Happy Effect, to the universal Ease and
Satisfaction of My People.

The Circumstances of Affairs making it necessary for Me to be out of the
Kingdom for some time, I shall take care to leave the Administration of the
Government, during My Absence, in the Hands of such Persons as I can Depend
upon.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

And then the Lord Keeper, by His Majesty's Command, said,

My Lords and Gentlemen, Thursday the Thirteenth day of May next; and this
Parliament is Prorogued accordingly to Thursday the Thirteenth day of May next.

FINIS.
