Love in the Blossom: Or, Fancy in the Bud.
Containing a Pretty, Pleasant and Delightful Courtship, betwixt two very Young
(but truly Amorous) Lovers, being persons of very Eminent Quality, (at their
first entrance into Cupids School.)

To the tune of, Amarillis told her Swain. J. P.





ONe Summer evening fresh and fair,
Walking out to take the Air,
Near to the Court, where Gallants sport,
I carefully did wander,
Whereas in State, two Lovers sat
Like Hero and Leander.
It was under a pleasant shade,
Where this pretty Couple played
They did not fear to be betrayed
Nor had not yet espied me,
To hear them prattle down I laid,
And closely I did hide me.
They were both of tender age,
In loves affairs for to engage,
Yet Cupids craft, with feathered shaft
Had wounded them at distance,
No humane art can cure the smart,
In vain was their resistance.
This young Gallant* stripling sat
By his loving Lady-mate,
And amorously began to prate
He had both time and leisure,
With kisses sweet, their lips did meet,
Wherein they took great pleasure.
She in Cloth of Gold did shine,
And her Beauty seemed divine,
I often wished she had been mine
Fain would I be his Taster;
But not one bit, that I could get,
It Was meat fit for my Master.
Having now both time and place
Lovingly for to embrace,
This Gallants care, was to prepare
The Art of Love to show her:
Then near I stepped and closely crept,
And thus I heard him woe her.
DEarest Love and Lady mine,
Let our hearts in one combine,
Within your breast, my soul does rest
Great Cupid has betrayed me:
To kill or cure, it is in your power
Your Captive he has made me.
At your mercy now I lie,
Grant me Love or else I die,
By virtue of your eye;
Dear heart in love I languish,
Then be not coy my only joy
But heal me of my anguish.



Then she made this sweet reply
A stranger unto Love am I,
Good Sir forbear, let me not hear
Of bondage at this season:
The Ciprian Boy shall not destroy
My freedom and my Reason.
But if ever I should prove,
Subject to the God of Love,
Methinks my mind is so inclined
Your Courtship is so moving,
No one but you, whom I do know,
Shall teach me the art of loving,

Then he was quick to speak again,
Whilst his hopes afresh remain;
He sometimes kissed, and sometimes mist
According as she strugled.
But had they stayed, i am half afraid
His ^o^es he would have doubled.
Now to break off their delight
They saw coming in their sight
Another pair, both fresh and fair
Of spruce and amorous Lovers;
And being met, they made no let
But all their love discovers.
Then they walked hand in hand,
Subject all to loves command:
I could not lie but up got I
To see some further sport Sir,
'Twas almost dark, when ore the Park
I see them pass toth' Court Sir.
Then I wished that I had there
Such a pretty Lady near
To court and kiss, to hit and miss,
As others had been wooing;
But all in vain I might complain,
For I could not be doing.
