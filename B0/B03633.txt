A Merry new song wherein you may view
The drinking Healths of a Ioviall Crew,
To 'thappie Return of the Figure of Two

The tune is, Ragged and torn and true.




I Have been a Traveller long,
and seen the conditions of all,
I see how each other they wrong,
and the weakest still goes to the wall:
And here I Will begin ^to relate,
the cross condition of those,
That hinder our happy state,
and now are turned our Foes.
Here Is a health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the issue renowned,
We Will bid all our sorrows adieu,
when the Figure of two shall be crowned.
I crossed the Ocean of late.
and there I did meet with a cross,
But having a pretty estate,
I never lamented my loss,
I never lamented my harms,
and yet I was wondrous sad,
I found all the Land up in Arms,
and I thought all the folk had bin mad,
^
Kind Countrymen, how fell you out,
I left you all quiet and still,
But things are now brought so about;
you nothing but Plunder and Kill:
Some do seem seemingly holy,
and would be Reformers of men,
But wisdom does laugh at their folly,
and says, they will be Children again,
Here Is a Health, etc.
But woe to the Figure of one,
King Solomon tells us so,
But he shall be wronged by none
that has two strings to his Bow.
How I love this Figure of two,
among all the Figures that be,
I Will moke it appear unto you,
if that you will listen to me,
Here Is a Health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the Issue Renowned,
We Will bid all our Sorrows adieu
(...)


OBseeve when the weather is cold,
I wear a Cap on my head,
But wish, if I may be so bold
the Figure of two in my bed.
Two in my bed I do crave,
and that is my self and my Mate,
But pray do not think I would have
two great large horns on my pate.
Here Is a Health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the Issue Renowned,
We Will bid all our Sorrows adue
when the Figure of two shall be Crowned,
Since Nature has given two hands,
but when they are foul I might scorn them,
Yet people thus much understands
two fine white gloves will adorn them:
Two feet for to be are up my body,
no more had the Knight of the Sun,
But people would think me a noddy
if two shoes I would not put on.
Here Is a Health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the Issue Renowned,
We Will bid all our Sorrows adieu
when the Figure of two shall be Crowned
The Figure of two is a thing
that we cannot well live without,
No more then without a good King,
though we be never so stout:
And this we may well understand.
if ever our Troubles should cease,
Two needful things in the Land
is a King, and a Justice of Peace.
Here Is a Health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the Issue Renowned,
We Will bid all our Sorrows adieu
when the Figure of two shall be Crowned.
And now for to draw to an end,
I wish a good happy conclusion,
The State would so much stand our friend
to end this unhappie Confusion:
The which might be done in a trice,
in giving of Ceasar his due,
If we were so honest and wise,
to think on the Figure of two.
Here Is a Health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the Issue Renowned,
We Will bid all our Sorrows adieu
when the Figure of tow shall be Crowned
If any desire to know
this Riddle I now will unfold,
It is a Man wrapped in woe,
whose Father is wrapped in mould:
So now to conclude my Song,
I mention him so much the rather,
Because he has suff'red some wrong;
and bears up the name of his Father.
Here Is a Health to the Figure of two,
to the rest of the Issue Renowned,
We Will bid all our Sorrows adieu
when the Figure of two shall be Crowned.
