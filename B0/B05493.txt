PROCLAMATION ANENT COPPER COIN.
EDINBVRGH, the twenty day of July, 1671. CHARLES by the Grace of God, King of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the Faith.
To (...) Macers, or Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly
and severally, specially constitute, greeting:
Forasmuch as the Lords of Our Privy Council, by their Proclamation of the date
the twenty fourth of April, 1662. did prohibit the Importation of these pieces
of Copper Coin, called the French Double, or Doits, or other foreign Copper
Money into this Kingdom: Notwithstanding whereof, considerable quantities of
the said Doits have been of late Imported, and do ordinarily pass at a rate
above the true worth and value thereof, to the great prejudice of our Leidges.
Therefore We, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, do hereby
prohibit and discharge all persons whatsoever, in time coming, to Import into
this Kingdom any Doits, or other foreign Copper Coin, under the pain of
confiscation of the same, and of the Ships and Bottoms wherein they are
Imported, by and attour such further punishment as Our Privy Council shall
think fit to inflict upon the Importers. And We discharge the said Doits, or
any foreign Copper Coin, either already Imported, or that shall be Imported
hereafter, to pass, or be current within this Our Kingdom, at any rates. And
commands and requires the Collectors or Farmers of Our Customs, and their
Deputs, Magistrates of Burghs, and others in Authority where Seaports are, to
seize upon any foreign Copper Money which shall be Imported, and to confiscat
the same for Our use. And Ordains these presents to be printed and published at
the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, that none pretend
ignorance.

Majesty. Anno DOM. 1671.
