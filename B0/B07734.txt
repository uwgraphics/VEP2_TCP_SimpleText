The buklar and defense
Of mother holy kyrke,
And weape^ to drive hence
All that against her wircke




Will none in all this land
Step forth and take in hand
These fellows to withstance
In nombrelyke the sand
That with the Gospel melles
And will do nothing else
But tratlynge tales telies
Against our holy prelacie
And holy churches dygnitie
Saying it is but papistrie
Yea feigned and Hipocrisy
Erroneous and heresye
And takes their authority
Out of the holy Euangelie
All customs ceremonial
And rytes ecclesiastical
Not grounded on scripture
No longer to endure
And thus ye may be sure
The people they alure
And draw them from your lore
The which will grieve you sore
Take heed I say therefore
Your need was never more
But sens ye be so slack
It greueth me a lack
To hear behind your back
How they will carpe and crack
And none of you that dare
Which one of them compare
Yet some there be that are
So bold to show their ware
And is no priest nor deacon
And yet will fire his becone
Against such fellows frail
Make out with tothe and nail
And hoyste up meyne sail
And manfully to fight
In holy prelates right
With pen and ynke and paper
And like no trifling Iaper
To touch these fellows in deed
With all expedient speed
And not before it need
And I in deed am he
That wayteth for to se
Who dare so hardy be
To encounter here with me
I stand here in defense
Of some that be far hence
And can both bliss and sense
And also undertake
Right holy things to make
Yea God within a cake
And who so that forsake
His bread shall be dowe bake
I openly profess
The holy blyssed mass
Of strength to be no less
Then it was at the first
But I would se who durst
Set that among the worst
For he should be acurst
With book, bell and candell
And so I would him handell
That he should right well know
How to escape I trow
So hardy on his head
Deprave our holy bread
Or else to prate or patter
Against our holy watter
This is a plain matter
It needs not to flatter
They be such holy things
As has been used with kings
And yet these lewd loselles
That brag upon their Gospelles
At ceremonies swelles
And at our christined belles
And at our long gowns
And at your shaven crowns
And at your typttes fine
The Iauelles will repyue
They say ye lead evil lives
With other men's wives
And will none of your own
And so your sede is sown
In other men's ground
True wedlock to confound
Thus do they rail and rave
Calling every priest knave
That loves mess to say
And after idle all day
They would not have you play
To drive the time away
But brabble on the Bible
Which is but impossible
To be learned in all your life
Yet therein be they ryfe
Which makes all this strife
And also the Paraphrasies
Much dyfferyng from your portaises
They would have daily used
And portaise clean refused
But they shall be accused
That have so far abused
Their tongues against such holiness
And holy churches busynes
Made hundred years a go
Great clearkes affyrmeth so
And other many mo
That searched to and fro.
In scripture for to find
What they might leave behind
For to be kept in mind
Among the people blind
As wauerynge as the wind
And wrote thereof such books
That who so on them lokes
Shall find them to be clerks
As proves by their warkes
And yet there be that barcke
And say they be but darcke
But hark ye loulars hark
So well we shall you marcke
That if the world shall turn
A sort of you shall burn
Ye durst as well I say
Within this two years day
As soon to run away
As such parts to play
When some did rule and reygne
And ancient things maintain
Which now be counted hayne
And brought into dysdayne
Such men I say they were
As loved not this gear
And kept you still in fear
To burn ^r faggottes here
Then durst ye not be bold
(Against our learnynges old
Or images of gold
Which now be bought and sold
And were the lay man's book
Whereon they ought to look)
One word to speak a mysse
Can ye say nay to this?
No no ye foles I wysse
A thing to plain it is.
Then did these clerks divine
Daily them selves enclyne
To prove and to defyue
That Christ's body above
Which suffered for our love
And dyed for our behoue
Is in the sacrament
Flesh blood and boue present
And bread and wine away
As Soon as they shall say
The words of consecracion
In time of celebracion
So must it be in deed
Though it be not in the creed
And yet these fellows new
Will say it is not true
Christ's body for to vewe
With any bodyly eye
That do they plain deny
And stiffly stand thereby
And enterprise to wryght
And also to endyght
Books both great and small
Against these fathers all
And heresy it call
That any man should teach
Or to the people preach
Such things without their reach
And some there be that say
That Christ cannot all day
Be kept within a box
Nor yet set in the stocks
Nor hydden like a fox
Nor presoner vnderlockes
Nor clothed with powdered armyne
Nor bredeth stynkynge vermyne
Nor dweleth in an house
Nor earyn of a mouse
Nor rotten is nor rustye
Nor moth eaten nor mustye
Nor light as is a fether
Nor blown away with wether
Nor moulde or he be spent
Nor yet with sire be burnt
Nor can no more be slain
Nor offered up again
Blessed sacrament for thy passion
Here and se our exclamacion
Against these men of new facion
That strive against the holy nation
And Jest of them in plays
In tauerns and bye ways
And their good ac^es dysprayse
And martyrs would them make
That brent were at a stake
And sing pype merry annot
And play of will not cannot
And as for cannot and will not
Though they speak not of it it skyll not
For a noble clarke of late
And worthy in estate
Has played with them chekmate
Their courage to abate
Mark well his text
He has been curstly vexed
I tear me he be wext
A popistant flour
Surely all the rout
That here is him shall doubt
He will be in and out
Prowlynge round about
To get forth the suout
If prayer may do good
All the whole brood
Skuruy, shabed, and skalde
Shaven shorn, and balde
Pore priests of Baule
We pray for him all
Unto the God of bread
For yt he be dead
We may go to bed
Blyndefylde and beled
Without rag or shred
But I am sore adred
I se him lake so red
Yet I durst ley my head
As doctor friar said
He has some what in s^ore
Well you shall knew more
Harken well therefore
Some shall pay the shore
He has been a pardoner
And also a garddener
He has been a vytailer
A lordly hospytelar
A noble teacher
And so so a preacher
Though Germyn his man
Were hanged what than?
Say worsse and you can
Best let him alone
For Peter James and John
And Apostles every one
I give you plain warning
Had never such learning
As has this famous clarke
He is learned be beyond the mark
And also master huggarde
Does show him self no sluggarde
Nor yet no dronken druggarde
But sharpeth up his wit
And frames it so fyt
These yonkers for to hit
And will not them permyt
In error shall to sit
As it may weliapeare
By his clarkely answer
The which entitled is
Against what means this
A man of old sort
And writes not in sport
But answers earnestly
Concludynge heresy
And yet as I trow
Some bluster and blow
And crake (as they crow)
But nets will we lay
To cache them if we may
For if I begin
I will bring them in
And feche in my cosens
By the whole dosens
And call them coram nobis
And teach them do minus vobis
With his et cum spiritu tuo
That holy be both dao
When they be said and song
In holy latin tongue
And solemn belles be ronge
But these babes be to young
Perkynge upon their patins
And feign would have the mattens
And eueinge song also
In English to be do
With marriage and baptysinge
Buryalles and other thing
In vulgar tongue to say and sing
And so they do it newly
In diverse places truly
Saying they do but duly
Mayntainynge it in any wise
So should they do their service
Alas who would not moan
Or rather grunt or grove
To se such service gone
Which saved many one
From deadly sin and shame
And many a spote of blame
From purgatory pain
And many shower of rain
Well yet I say again
Some honest men remain
And keep their customs still
And ever more will
Wherefore in deed my read is
To take you to your beads
All men and women I say
That uses so to pray.
That such good priests may
Continue so always
Orels none otherlyke
But al lies in the dyke
And look ye do not faint
But pray to some good saint
That he may make restraint
Of all these strange farions
And great abomynacions,
Because I may nor tarry
I pray to sweet sir Harry
A man that will not vary
And one that is no sculker
But kan*knyghte of the Sepulcher
That he may stand fast
And be not over cast
Or else to be the last
Of all them that do yield
In cite town or field
For if he styke therein
No doubt he shall not blyn
Till he come to eternytie
With all his whole fraternity
Amen therefore say ye
That his partakers be
Ye get no more of me.
Finis.
