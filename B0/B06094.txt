To a Pleasant New TUNE CALLED A Pot of Good Ale.
GOOD people, what! will you of all be bereft?
Will you never Learn Wit, whilst a penny's left?
We Are all like the Dog in the Fable betrayed;
To let go the Substance, and snap at the Shade.
These Specious Pretenses,
And Foreign Expenses.
^o war for Religion will wast all our Chink:
It Is Snipt, and it is Clipped;
And it is Spent, and it is Lent,
'Till it is gone; 'till it is gone, to the Devil, I think.
We pay for our Newborn, and pay for our Dead:
We pay if we are Single, and pay if we Wed,
Which shows our unmerciful Senate don't fail,
To begin with the Head, and Tax down to the Tail.
We pay through the Nose.
For Subjecting our Foes;
Yet for all our Expenses, get nothing but Blows.
Abroad we are Defeated;
At Home we are Cheated.
And the End on it, the End on t, The Lord above knows.
We Have parted with all our old Money, to show
Ho we foolishly hoped, for a plenty of New,
But might have remembered when it comes to a Push
A bird in the Hand, is worth two in the Bush.
We now like poor Wretches,
Are kept Shut, under Hatches
At ^ack, and at Manger, like Beast in the Ark
Since our Burgesses and Knights,
Makes us pay for our Lights;
Why should we, Why should we, be kept in the Dark.
FINIS.
