The ^raise of Saint David's day.
Showing the Reason why the Welshmen honor the Leeke on that day.
To the tune of When this Old Cap was new.




Who list to read the deeds
by valiant Welch-men done,
Shall find them worthy m^n of Arms,
as breath is beneath the Sun:
They are of valiant hearts,
of nature kind and meek,
An honor on Saint David's, day,
it is to wear a Leeke.
The Welsh most ancient is
of this our famous land,
Who were the first that conquered it,
by force and warlike hand.
From Troy stout, Brute did come,
this kingdom for to seek;
Which was possessed by sauage-men,
then honored be the Leeke.
He having won the same,
and put them to the sword:
Of Brute did Britain first take name,
as Chronicles record.
The Welsh true Britains are,
whose swords in blood did reeke,
Of Pagan men being heathenish,
then honored be the Leeke.
And now if you would know,
why they the Leeke do wear,
In honor of Saint David's day,
It plainly shall appear.
Upon Saint David's day,
and first of March that week,
The Welch-men with their foes did join,
then honored be the Leeke.
And being in the field,
their valor they did try;
Where thousands on both sides being slain,
within their bloods did lie.
And they not knowing how
their friends from foes to seek,
Into a Garden they did go,
where each one pulled a Leeke:
And wore it in his Hat,
their Contrymen to know;
And their most valiantly they did,
overcome their warlike for.
Then were no colors known,
nor any feathers eeke;
The feathers first or'ginall,
it was the Welch-mans Leeke,
And ever since that time,
the Leeke they use to wear
In honor of Saint David's day,
they do that Trophy bear.
A Reverend Bishop was
Saint David mild and meek,
And it is an honor that same day,
for them to wear a Leeke.
The second part.
To the same tune.




FOr Englishmen Saint George,
Saint Andrew for the Scot,
Saint Patericke for Ireland,
Saint David Welshmens Lot:
In honor of which Saint,
those Country men do seek,
For to remember the same day,
in wearing of a Leeke.
Each Country has his Saint,
why should not Welsh-men then
Give honor to her Country due,
as well as other men,
A Reason for the same,
are many men to seek,
Then Know it is an honor brave,
that day to wear a Leeke.
What Royal Princes have,
in fruitful Wales bin borne,
Yea for to wear a Leeke that day,
they took it for no scorn.
The seventh Henery,
was borne on mountain Peke,
Which on that day did use to wear,
in solemn sort the Leeke.
From him Elizabeth,
did lineally descend,
Who did the Gospel true maintain,
until her life did end,
And she upon that day,
with diverse Courtiers meek
In token of that victory,
did wear the honored Leeke,
And Royal Kings likewise,
from Heneryes loins did spring,
With many noble Princes else,
besides our Royal King,
And Princes more of Wales*
that day were never to seek,
For on that day for David's sake,
they always wore a Leeke*
When Princes of the Blood,
did celebrate the same,
Whom foreign nations so admired,
and praised with lasting fame,
Who had such Lions hearts,
yet like to lambs were meek,
That did in honor of that day,
still wear the royal Leeke.
I call it Royal Leeke,
Cause Princes it does wear,
Let no true hearted Welch-man than,
disdain the same to bear:
But let them now as they,
true honor always seek,
And still remember David's day:
in wearing of a Leeke.
FINIS.
