THE Cuckold in Purgatory: OR, The FALL of the Second Man, ADAM.
ADAM the First on Apple made his Meal,
The Second on a daintier Dish called Teal;
Both equally forbid, and did foretell
(As Adam's Fall) the Fall of C -- pel;
Yet wiser he, though Beggarly and Poor,
Took Eve, not as his Wife, but as his Whore;
Whilst modern Adam, to compleat's Miscarriage,
Has took his Virtuous Eve (both ways) in Marriage,
Meanly deserting Paradise's Glory;
To be a Drudg in his own Purgatory;
The First discreetly chose the milder Curse,
And took for Better what he took for Worse;
If such a Cardinal great Rome had bred,
As shit his Cap to put on his own Head,
Shame of the Conclave! from the sight of Men,
She Would soon Translate him to the Lion's Den;
Which, (useless now) the prudent State believes,
Is best converted to a Den for Thieves.
FINIS.
