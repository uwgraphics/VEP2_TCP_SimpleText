The FOUR WONDERS of this Land,
Which unto you we will declare:
The Lord's great Mercy it is great;
God give us Grace to stand in fear,
And watch and pray both Night and Day,
That God may give us all his Grace,
To repent our Sins then every one,
Our Time is going on apace.

Tune of Dear Love regard my Grief, etc.
Licensed according to Order.





SWeet England call for Grace,
with speed leave off thy Sin,
And with a contrite Heart
to Prayers now begin.
For sure the time is come,
that Christ our Savior told;
Toward the latter Day,
we Wonders shall behold.
And now strange Wonders rare,
the Lord from Heaven does send
In Earth, and in the Air,
because we should amend.
Great Lights within the Sky
has often been seen, we hear,
To many Peoples view,
in Countries far and near.
But what it does presage,
no Man on Earth does know:
None but the living God
such Wonders strange can show.
But to the Subject now,
which I do mean to write;
The strangest News I Will tell,
which Time has brought to light.
IN London now does live
one Mr. Clark by Name,
A Tailor by his Trade,
of good Report and Fame.
His Wife being with Child,
unto her Grief and Woe,
She with a Neighbor's Wife
fell out; the Truth is so.
And after many Words,
to fighting then they go,
This Woman being with Child,
received a grievous Blow
Upon her Belly then,
(which makes my Heart to bleed)
That she went home, and sent
for Midwife's help, with speed.
In have the Midwife came,
and other Women store,
Which by the help of God,
she Seven Children bore.
Seven dainty Boys she had,
all which were born in sight,
All framed with perfect Shape,
with Ioints and Limbs aright.
But they were all Still-born;
which grieved their Parents sore:
But of the Works of God,
in this they do deplore.
The Woman now does mend,
whereby God's Works are known:
And now this wondrous News,
both far and near is shown.
THe second News I
comes from brave Yorkshire.
A Monster there was born,
the like you never did hear.
Three Miles from Pomfret lived
a Woman of great Worth,
In Travail fell, and brought
to light a monstrous Birth:
Just the shape of a Colt,
to all the Peoples sight;
Which bred Amazement great,
with Tears and with Fright,
To see this Woman's Grief,
and Trouble of her Mind,
In bringing forth a Colt,
contrary unto kind.
Long Legs, round Feet, long Nose,
and Headed like a Horse,
Which filled these Women's Hearts
with Pity and Remorse.
This Woman now does mend,
whereby God's Works are known:
And now this wondrous News,
both far and near is shown.
ANd the third News most rare,
the which I have to tell,
London can witness true,
that there a Monster fell.
In Christ-Church Parish lived
a Woman known full well,
Of honest Carriage, which
her Neighbors all can tell.
This Woman being with Child,
which Grief and Sorrow bred,
Into the World she bore
a Child without a Head.
The Face was in the Breast,
to all the Peoples view;
But it died suddenly:
this is approved true.
It is for certain true,
and is approved plain;
From Earth I say it came,
and to Earth it turned again.
These Women now all three
are on the mending hand:
But Three such monstrous Births
was never in fair England.
THe Fourth News most rare,
the which I have to tell;
In famous Gloucestershire
a wondrous Shower fell.
Not (...) Town,
a (...) is called Brandwood,
Upon a Hedge of Clothes,
for truth, it rained Blood.
A Maid being starching there,
as Reason does require,
She went to fetch in Wood
wherewith to make a Fire:
And having on such Cuffs,
as Starchers often do use,
Upon them fell some drops
of Blood, made her to muse.
And holding up her Head,
which made her wonder more,
She saw the Hedge of Clothes,
with Blood besprinkl'd over.
Then she throw'd down the Wood,
and with amazement great
She went into the House,
and this News did repeat.
The People then came forth,
and found the News was true;
They saw the Hedge of Clothes
with Blood besprinkl'd to their view.
Then they took in the Clothes,
and washed them that same Day;
But Water, Leez, nor Soap,
could take the Blood away.
We are so wicked grown,
the Heavens do for us bleed,
And Wonders strange are shown:
all this is true indeed.
Sodom was warned before,
so was Jerusalem,
And many Places more,
whom God did plague for Sin.
But we are like the Jews,
our Hearts are now so hard,
That we will not believe,
nor yet God's Word regard.
Now, think upon each Sin,
Pride, Whoredom, Drunkenness,
Swearing, Deceit, and Lies,
and vile Covetousness.
Then we shall see our God
will take us for his own,
If we believe these Signs
and Tokens God has shown.
Concluding thus my News:
The God of Truth and Peace
Grant that the Gospel may
continually increase.
