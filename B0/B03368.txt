The Fox too Cunning for the Lion.
OR, The Foxes feast, wherein is expressed
Many a witty but most true jest,
Both old and young of it take a view,
And by experience you will say it is true.

To the Tune of, the Three Cheators.


A Den of Foxes on a day
Met together as men say,
Where they used to frequent,
Into a hole then straight they went;
Thus one unto the other said,
the Foxes wills shall be obeyed.
Where a Counsel they did hold
Scorning for to be controlled;
One more cunning then the rest
In a Robe himself then dressed;
Then give ear and understand
there is many Foxes in this Land.
One Robed like a Friar some say,
Did imitate to Preach and Pray
Unto the Geece like Nuns attired,
For his heart by them was fired,
Beloved sister then he said,
draw near to me be not afraid.
And although I am not tall
I have longing bowels for you all.
If they were Nuns he loved them dear
But they were Geece it does appear:
He did seduce them by a wild,
and every one of them beguiled,
A mighty feast they then did hold,
Of hollow fouls as I was told;
And then went to the Lions Cave
Dearly longing that to have
A cunning plot by them was laid,
which made the Lion sore afraid.
And by their subtlety (as then)
They forced the Lion from his den.
Then by their subtlety and strength,
The Lion then intrapt at length:
Then cruelly they did him slay
to have his den therein to play.
The young Lions then did fly,
(Not daring for to stay thereby)
To seek more Lions in a Land
The Foxes strength for to withstand;
And intending to pursue,
are returning with their crew.
One Fox more subtle then the rest,
Stood strutting up and did protest,
That he and his young ones then
Would have the dreadful Lions den,
With one consent perforce (they said)
this Foxes will must be obeyed,
The Second Part
to the same Tune.


ANd whilst within that he did stay
He frighted all the rest away,
The greedy Fox with Price of gore,
Did feed on Plate and silver ore:
But having fed beyond his strength
He fell sick and died at length.
The firighted Foxes then returned
But for the other never mourned,
They drove the young whelp out of his den
And possessed themselves again
Of their former playing place,
To the dead Foxes much disgrace.
There was another Fox beside
That in his tail did take such pride,
So cruelly was he bent then,
He fed upon poor wounded men;
And now he is gone as I hear tell
To fright the Devil out of Hell.
Another he had gained such power
That he held a mighty Tower,
That no one durst him withstand,
Of such power was his command,
But the rest would not obey,
But forced him for to run away.
The was a fair kept in the West,
And in a Booth they kept a feast,
The Foxes hearing of such cheer
Put the feasters in such fear,
That for fear they ran away,
And the Foxes had a gallant prey*
From the North came such a wind
The Foxes feared their tayls behind,
They sent one then with all speed
To beat them back if there be need:
Afterward they set him free,
For of their Rump he must not be.
Another Fox had but one eye,
After him went a Hue and cry,
'Cause out of sight and under shade,
He did use the Cobling trade:
For killing many I have heard,
He was hanged up in Paul's Churchyard
Of Foxes we no number know,
Because that they are Lambs in show.
You that hunt Foxes have a care,
Least that it do your health impare,
And of late to mind I call,
I caught a Fox that made me fall.
