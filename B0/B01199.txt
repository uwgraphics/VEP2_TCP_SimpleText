A pretty new Ditty: OR A young Lasses Resolution,
As her mind I truly scan,
Who shows in conclusion,
She loves a handsome young man.

To the tune of I know what I know.




YOung Maids and young Men
I pray you give ear,
And with hand and pen
I Will plainly declare,
Of a Maids resolution
which to love is won,
And in the conclusion,
She Will have a handsome young man.
Quoth she, I am young,
and now in my prime,
Though some stay too long,
yet I Will lose no time:
I will have some pleasure
as soon as I can,
What care I for treasure.
I Will have a handsome young man.
Some Maidens are coy,
and strange in their carriage,
And scorn to enjoy
a neat young man in marriage:
Some wed for money,
and some wed for Land;
But I Will choose a honey,
Shall be a handsome young man,
I have known some Maids
that have denied men,
And afterward glad
to obtain them again:
They will not, and will,
thus will they withstand;
But i will use my skill
To have a handsome young man.
Some happily will
conjecture of me,
That I desire still
to live wantonly:
No, I am a Less sure,
that live unwedded can,
And much will endure
For a handsome young man.
I would have you know,
that I am not so base,
Nor shall our sex so
by me have disgrace.
No, I have some treasure
beside house and Land.
Therefore i will have pleasure
With a handsome young man,
The man that i will choose
Shall be of good size,
Yet i will none refuse
if that he be wise:
With handsome complexion,
neat foot, leg, and hand:
This is my affection
To have such a man.
If I wed a fool
with great store of treasure,
Then he will pine and whule,
and debar me of pleasure:
He Will tell me of fine Gowns,
Kertles, Mask and Fan;
For a thousand pounds
I Will not wed such a man.
The second part,
To the same tune.




ANd further than that,
If I wed with a clown,
He Will answer me What,
and with anger he will frown:
Then must I beware,
perchance with his hand
He Will strike me o'th ear:
But i will have no such man.
And many there are,
that are somewhat jealous,
But i will have a care,
and match no such fellows;
Their wives near to men
must not sit nor stand,
But their heads ache then,
oh hang up such a man.
Lo thus I have shown
the conditions of some:
But none can be known
till to trial they come;
And I am inclined
as soon as I can,
For to be joined
With a handsome young man.
Some Maidens do choose
for to have Tradesmen.
And some will refuse
them as much again.
But for my own part,
as at first I began,
I love with my heart
a handsome young man.
Let him be a Tailor,
or a neat Shoo-maker,
A Weauer or Glouer,
a Brewer or Baker:
Be he neat or comely,
my love is soon won,
For my mind is only
Of a handsome young man.
If that he be gallant,
or mean in apparel;
If his looks be valiant,
to maintain his quarrel,
Then shall he be welcome
unto pretty Nan,
For I am delightsome
To a handsome young man.
I pass not what name
he is called by,
If that I can frame
to love him truly,
Either Dicke or Robin,
Humphrey, Will, or John,
Any one me shall win
That Is a handsome young man,
And thus I conclude,
and here end my Song,
Let none think me rude,
nor large of my tongue:
For I am intended
as first I began,
Then let me be friended
With a handsome young man.
FINIS.
