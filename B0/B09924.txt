It is humbly desired by William Ryley Clerk of the Records in the Tower, that
you will be pleased to assist him in his Petition.
1. THat (in regard there is due to him in arrears 120. l. as an officer of
Arms, for want whereof, he and his family are unable to subsist) some present
support may be allowed him as Clerk of the Records in the Tower, which Office
was chiefly supported by the Court of Wards (lately taken away) which
occafioned many searches in the said Office of Records; yet those that depended
upon the said Court are to have a competent satisfaction, in liew of their
offices, and the profits which they respectively had thereby, as by an
Ordinance of Parliament, dated 4th. Martii, 1645. may appear.

2. And that for the maintenance of the Petitioner for the future, it may (if
you please) be referred to the Committee of the Revenew, to consider of it, and
to report to the House what may be a competent Salary for him, that an
Ordinance may be drawn up accordingly.
