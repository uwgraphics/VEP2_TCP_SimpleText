THE CASE OF Many Inhabitants of the Town of Chattham, in the County of Kent,
many of which are Innholders, and Victuallers.
To the Honorable House of Commons in Parliament Assembled.
THAT the said Inhabitants have from time to time as often as occasion has
been, Entertained Sick and Wounded Seamen, sent on Shore from the Men of War,
during all the Time of the late War; and have furnished them with all
Necessaries for their Subsistence.

THAT the said Inhabitants have by such Subsistence run themselves into very
many and great Debts with their Brewers, Bakers, Butchers, and other Tradesmen.

THAT the said Inhabitants are brought so very poor, that they cannot any
longer give Subsistence to the said poor Seamen; and the said Inhabitants and
their Families must unavoidably perish, if not timely relieved; several of them
having been Arrested by their said Creditors, and others withdrawn for fear,
having left their Families to Ruin.

Wherefore the said Inhabitants most Humbly beg, That this Honorable House
would be pleased to take their miserable Case into Your serious Considerations;
and to give them such Relief therein, as Your Honors shall think convenient,
that thereby they may be enabled still to supply the said Sick and Wounded
Seamen;
