A Pleasant new SONG, in Praise of the Leather Bottell
Showing how Glasses and Pots are laid aside,
And Flaggons and Noggins they cannot abide,
And let all Wives do what they can,
It Is for the praise and use of Man;
And this you may very well be sure,
The Leather Bottel will longest endure:
And I wish in Heaven his soul may dwell,
That first devised the Leather Bottel.
To the Tune of, The Bottel-makers Delight.


GOd above that made (...) things,
the Heav^ns, the Earth, and all therein,
The Ships that on the Sea do swim,
to keep Enemies out that now comes in:
And let them do all (...)
it is for the use and (...) of man,
And I wish in Heaven his soul may dwell
That first devised the Leather Bottel.
Then what do you say to these Cans of Wood,
in faith they (...), and cannot be good;
For when a man he does them send
to be filled with Ale, as he does intend,
The bearer falls by the way,
and on the ground the li^uor does lay.
And then the Bearer (...) to ^an
and swears it is long of the Wooden Can*
But had it been in a Leather Bottel,
although he had fallen ^^t all had been well,
And I wish, etc.
Then what do you say to these Glasses fine?
yes, they shall have no praise of mine;
For ^^^n a co^^^ny they are set
(...) aswe are met:
Then if you ^^^^ce to touch the Brim
do^n (...) all therein;
If your (...) fine

But had it been in (...) L^^^^^^ Bottel
and the (...), then all had been well.
Then I wish, etc.
The Second Part
to the same Tune.
TH^^ what do you say to these black pots three?
tr^^, they shall have no praise of me,
For when (...) his wife falls at strife,

But (...) ^^other day

But (...) Bottel,

And (...) till their hearts did ache,
(...) no harm would take.
Then I wish, etc.
Then what (...) the Siver Flagons fine?

For ^hen a Lord he does them send

Then I wish, etc.
A Leather Bottel is good,
Far better th^^ Glasses or Cans of Wood,
For when a man is (...) in the Field,
