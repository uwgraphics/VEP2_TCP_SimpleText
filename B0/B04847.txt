day, in the year out quite,
is fifteen pound four shillings and two pence now right:

xi d. Eleven pence. vi s. v d. xxv s. viij d. xvi l. xiiij s. vii d. This
Eleven pence a day, the year who it use
is xvi pound xiv shillings vii pence, which makes me to muse:
For this will pay servants wages, and thy house rent:
wherefore measure thy expense, and be content.
To save thee and thine
this great expense flee:
For servant to help thee,
by this paid will be.
xij d. Twelve pence. vij s. xxviii s. xviij l. v d. This Twelve pence a day
the whole year does amount,
to eighte^n pound five shillings, mark this last account:
Ten pounds yearly of this prodigal spending,
would purchase for thee a House to thy lives ending.
Beware of this riot,
it spues thee out quite:
From house here on earth,
and from place in Gods sight.


MEasurable expense,
with thy like is much worth
But with thy Betters
thou may not compare:
If Rake-hells call thee,
with them go not forth,
Least thy purse and honesty,
they do make bare.
Choose thou honest
and quiet company,
With such a penny,
is much better spent:
Then that which is spared
with living too nigardly,
As some mizers do,
and yet are not content.
At the Dice play not
with one or other,
Above thy quart,
or pint of Wine:
Unless some make thee
a cozened brothe^:
Never for money
to them do incline.
Neither at Cards for money,
look that thou play
Nor do thou accustom^bly
them frequent and use:
But for recreation
at Eeven, or in day,
Other wise to use them.
some may thee abuse.
At Tables also
at Irish or Ticktack,
Play not but for sport,
or for Bear or Ale:
A spurt and away,
least that thy work slack,
By sitting to hear
each Ianglers tale.
The Tenice and Bowls,
take heed of them two,
Use neither of them
for Silver nor Gold:
But only for pastime,
as some neighbors do
For Apples and Nuts,
thou may so be bold.
Remember this well,
now herein expressed,
Young men of Sciences,
and Crafts-men all,
Let loss of time,
in you be redress,
And to your Vocation
diligently fall.
Time past and ill spent,
is a great offense:
Time lost will hardly
again be found,
Except thou give
great diligence,
To follow that,
whereto thou art bound.
Ye rich of the World,
take here cke a Lesson,
As Stewards and not Lords,
Gods gifts you do hold:
Vain expense and excess,
you must abandon,
Especially when poor Christ
dies with cold.
For Prince, Realm, and poor
these things are lent,
Dame pleasure may not,
as hers them enjoy:
These goods therefore
must of thee be so spent.
As yield account rightly,
thou must with great joy.
J. Gilbert.
FINIS.
FOr the understanding of this Table following, know ye, that in the first two
spaces is contained, from the upper end unto the lower end, the prices of a
quarter of Wheat from twenty shillings, unto eleven shillings. In the next
three Spaces, be contained the number how many shillings, pence and grains, the
penny white Loaf (by the Statute, shall weigh) according to the price of a
quarter of Wheat.

And in the last three spaces are contained the number of shillings, pence, and
grains, corrected according to just Assize; for the which grains, a Wheat corn
is counted for a grain; And here is to be noted, that thirty two Wheat corns
(white wheat in the midst of the ear) are counted for a penny weight, and
twelve of those pence make a shilling, and twenty of those shillings make an
ounce, and twelve of those ounces make a pound of Troy-weight, and so does
twenty shillings, after that reckoning make just the same pound where, with
Bread ought to be weighed. And the penny wheaten Loaf shall we^gh three half
penny white Loaves.

The old Rule of Sages by good Experience.
He that earneth a Groat,
and in like time it spends,
May live, but not thrive,
whatsoever he pretends.
He that spends two pence,
and earneth daily a Groat;
Shall both live and thrive,
and in time gather somewhat.
But he that spends a Groat,
and earneth but two pence,
Shall neither live nor thrive,
Wherefore fly such expense.
