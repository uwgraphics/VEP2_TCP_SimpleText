Companies and Colors.

THe Lords and others of the Committee of the Estates presently conveened,
taking to their consideration the great prejudice and danger which may arise to
the present Army and Expedition for England, by some who having gone out with
the said Army and Expedition, may hereafter turn back and run away from
their Company and Colors: For remedy whereof, it is Statute and Ordained,
That all those both of Horse and Foot who shall run away from their Colors and
Companies without a Pass, shall be apprehended by the Colonells and Committees
of War within ilk Shire, or Magistrates within Burgh where they dwell, and
others whom they shall appoint for that effect where ever they can be found,
and sent again with all diligence to their Company and Colors, there to be
punished conform to the Articles of Military Discipline; or else that the
Committees of War and Colonells within ilk Shire, and Magistrates within ilke
Burgh (if they think it expedient for the good of the Army, and for terrifying
others from running away in like manner) decimat the said fugitives both horse
and foot, from their Companies and Colors, being apprehended, and cause hang
the tenth man of them: And if there be but one or more of them within ten, to
cause hang one of them, albeit there be but one, and cause send the rest of the
said fugitives, horse and foot, to the Committee of the Estates at Edinburgh,
upon the expenses of the Public, to be punished with a mark of infamy, and
sent back to their Colors. And because the resetting and intertaining of the
said fugitives, imboldens and incourages them to keep themselves still
lurking, and incourages others by their example to run away; Therefore it is
statute and ordained, that whosoever shall keep, reset, or entertain any of the
foresaids fugitives, horse or foot, and shall not dilate or deliver them to the
said Committee and Colonels of the Shire, or Magistrates within Burgh, with all
possible diligence; Then the said resetters shall be repute and esteemed as
disaffected, and enemies to Religion, to their Country, and to the Cause
presently in hand; and shall be accordingly punished by the Committee of the
Estates, or Committees and Colonells of war where they dwell, or Magistrates
within Burgh; and shall be punished with the loss of the half of all their
moveable goods; the one half whereof, shall be employed for the use of the
Public, and the other half of the samine shall pertain to whatsoever person
shall dilate the foresaids persons, resetters and entertainers, and who shall
qualify the foresaid reset and entertainment: To whom the said Committee of
Estates promises hereby, upon their honor and credit, to grant and dispone
the present right and possession of the samine. And if the Committees and
Colonels of war, within each division, or any person being thereupon, or
Magistrates within ilke Burgh, shall be negligent in taking order with the
foresaids fugitives and runawayes from their Colors, and with their resetters
and entertainers, or shall be deficient in putting of this Act to execution
after the form and tenor hereof, ilke person of the said Committees of war,
and Colonels, and the Magistrates within ilke Burgh, shall be fined by the
Committee of Estates, in the sum of three hundred pounds Scottish money, for
ilk failie tottes quoties; the one half of which fine, shall pertain to the
Public, and the other half thereof to the parties dilaters. And also it is
statute and ordained, that if it come to the knowledge of any person, who have,
or shall happen hereafter to out-reach Soldiers, on horse or foot, that these
out-reached by them, are disbanded and fled from their Colors, the said
out-putters of them shall be obliged to search, seek, and apprehend the said
fugitives, through the whole bounds of the Parishes or Burghs where the said
out-putters dwells, and shall either apprehend them, and present them to the
Committee and Colonells of the Shire, or to the Magistrates of the said
Burghes, that order may be taken with them, conform to the tenor of this
present Act; or else shall put them from the bounds of the said Parish or
Burgh: or otherwise, if the said out-putters shall be negligent to do their
exact diligence herein, the said out-putters shall be obliged to make up their
number by out-putting of men in their places, sufficiently provided in Arms and
other necessaries, upon the said out-putters their own expenses. And ordains
this Act to be printed, and ane copy thereof to be sent to every Parish Kirk,
and to every Commit of war, and every Burgh within ilke division within
this Kingdom: And that it be read at ilk Parish Kirk, upon ane Sunday, and
