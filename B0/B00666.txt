THE INTENTIONS OF THE ARMY OF THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND.
THE best endeavors and greatest works wherein the good hand and providence of
God have been most evident and sensible, and the hearts and intentions of men,
called to be the instruments, most pious and sincere, Though they found
approbation with the wiser sort, and such as are given to observation, yet they
have ever been subject to be misconstrued by blind suspicion, to be reproved by
cavelling censure, which makes place for it self to enter where it finds
none, and to be condemned of the ignorant, but most of all of the malicious,
who cannot be pleased even when God is best pleased; and when men seek to
approve themselves to every ones Conscience, but in their hearts wish rather
that the Temple should not be built, Religion never reformed, and they
themselves Issachar like, couch between the two burdens, then that they
should be in their wordly projects or possessions opposed or troubled. The
deliverance of the people of God of old from the Egyptian servitude; The
redemption of the Kirk by the Son of God, and the planting of Christian
Religion by his servants, and the vindication of Religion from Romish
Superstition and Tyranny, which are the Greatest and most wonderful works of
God, have been most bitterly calumniated, and spitefullly spurned against by
the wicked.

The nature and quality of this good work wherein the Lord has honored us to
be actors, and the experience which we have found of continual opposition
since the beginning may teach us, if we be not as the Horse and Mule which have
no understanding, that we are to expect the gainsaying of sinners, and that
nothing can be hatched in hell by Satan, or prompted by his Supposts, on earth,
which will not be produced to make us and the Cause of God which we maintain
odious to all men, but most of all to our Neighbors and dearest Brethren. When
we shall now enter into England it will be laid to our charge that we mind
nothing but Invasion, and that no less has been intended by us from the
beginning then under the pretext of seeeking our Religion and Liberties to
enrich our selves with their possessions and goods: But our peaceable carriage
many years past before the time of those late troubles, our Informations,
Declarations and Remonstrances published to the world, wherein we have Cursed
all National Invasion, and our willingness when we were in Arms to lay them
down upon the small hopes of enjoying our Religion and Liberties; and our
forbearing now, by way of reprisall, to satisfy our selves upon the Ships
and goods of our dear Brethren of England, for those Ships and goods of ours,
that have been taken by the Kings Ships, which possibly we might have been able
to do, had not Justice forbidden us, to take from them, whom we are assured,
neither wish us harm, nor have done us wrong, will be conceived by the wise
and well affected to be more plain and sure evidences of our meaning then all
that malice can devise, or calumny can express against us.

Neither have any new emergents adhered, but rather confirmed our former
resolutions: for although both before and since the Late Pacification we have
been highly injured by some Papists and Prelates, and their adherents there, who
have been, and are still seeking no less, then that we should no more be a
Kirk or Nation, and therefore themselves cannot think but we must account of
them as Gods enemies and ours: Yet above all the favors we have received from
the good people and body of the Kingdom of England, One there is which has
highly honored them before the world, and endeared them unto us more then
before, which shall never be forgotten by us, and we hope shall be thankfully
remembered by our Children, and Childrens Children after us to all generations;
That when upon misinformation the Council of England had concluded to raise
Force against us, when the Parliament of Ireland had offered their Persons and
Estates for supply against us; when all plots and policies were set on work,
and Public Declarations by Authority were made, and the Parliament called for
this very end, when we had been traduced, and Proclaimed as Traitors and
Rebels at every Parish Church, yet so wise, so grave, so just was that High
Court of Parliament (to their everlasting honor be it remembered) that no
threatenings, nor fears, no promises nor hopes, no fierceness, nor cunningly
devised suggestion could move them to decerne a war, or grant any Subsidy
for a war against us, but rather by their speeches, complaints and grievances
parallel to ours, did justify the Cause (so much as in them was) which we
defend. This rich and recent favor does so bind our hearts, that were our
power never so great, we should judge our selves the unworthiest of all men,
and could look for no less then vengeance from the righteous God, if we should
move hand or foot against that Nation so comfortably to us represented in that
honorable meeting. In this our thankful acknowledgement, we desire that the
City of London may have their own large share as they well deserve by the noble
profession they have given of their constant affection to Religion, and the
peace of both Kingdoms, notwithstanding the continual assaults of the
misleaders of the King against them, always rendering them sediticus in his
ears. And if this which does so convince us shall not be thought sufficient to
satisfy all the good people of England, We now before God and the World make
offer in general, and we make offer to so many of them as shall require it in
particular, of the strongest and most inviolable bond of our solemn Oath and
religious attestation of the Great Name of GOD, who is our fear and dread, and
from whom we hope for a blessing upon our expedition, that we intend no enmity
or rapine, and shall take no man's goods, nor engage our selves in blood by
fighting, unless we be forced unto it, which we may look for from the Papists
and Prelates, But if any such thing shall come from godly men, or good Partons,
who love the truth of Religion, or the Kings honor and their own liberty, both
the rule of Charity (which entertaineth no suspicion, where there is no evil
deserving) and the soul of wisdom (which teaches that both Nations must now
stand or fall together) do forbid us to apprehend. All the design of both
Kingdoms is for the truth of Religion, and for the just liberty of the
Subject, and all the devises and doings of the enemy are for the oppressing of
both, that our Religion may be turned into Superstition and Atheism, and our
liberty into base servitude and bondage. To bring this to pass they have
certainly conceived that the blocking up of this Kingdom by Sea and Land would
prove a powerful and infallible means, For, for either within a very short
time shall we through want of trade, and spoiling of our goods be brought to
such extreme poverty and confusion, that we shall miserably desire the
conditions which we now despise, and decline, and be forced to embrace their
will for a Law, both in Church and policy, which will be a precedent for the
like misery in England, who timously foreseeing it may be taught by their and
our danger to be more wise, or upon the other part, we shall by this Invasion
be constrained furiously and without order to break into England, which we
believe is the most earnest desire of our common enemies, because a more speedy
execution of their design: for we doubt not but upon our coming clamours will
be raised, Posts sent, and Proclamations made, through the Kingdom, to slander
our pious and just intentions (as if this had been our meaning from the
beginning) to stir up all the English against us, that once being entered in
blood, they may with their own Swords extirpate their own Religion, lay a
present foundation with their own hands for building of Rome in the midst of
them, and be made the Actors of their own and our slavery to continue for Ever.
But in this admirable opportunity of vindication of true Religion and just
liberty, if divine providence be looked upon with a reverend eye, and men
fearing God, and loving the Kings honor, and peace of both Kingdoms, shall
walk worthy of their profession, although the enemies have obtained so much of
their desires, as by cords of their own twisting, to draw us into England, yet
may their maine design be disappointed, the Rope which they have made brought
upon their own necks, and their wisdom turned to foolishness, which we have
reason to hope for from that supreme wisdom and power which has in all the
proceedings of this work turned their devises upon their own pates that
plotted them.

In our Informations, Remonstrances, and the true representation of our
proceedings since the last pacification, we have so far expressed the wrongs
which we have sustained, and the distresses which we suffer, as may make
manifest our pressing necessity to take some other course for our present
relief, then such petitions supplications and commissions, as we have used
before with less success then could be expected of a Kingdom from their
native King. Before we stirred so much as with a petition, we endured for many
years not only the continual opposition of the truth, and power of Religion
by Prelates and Papists, but also the violation of all our liberties, and
almost the total subversion of our Religion, which was our comfort in the
sight of God, and the glory of this Nation in the sight of other Churches, who
by the testimony of their Divines made our Reformation the measure of their
wishes, and would have redeemed it with their greatest worldly losses, when
gross Popery was notoriously obtruded upon us in the Book of Canons and
common Prayer, without consent or knowledge of the Churches; and the plot of
the Prelates and Papists wholly discovered how to settle it in both Nations: We
added to our former sufferings no other Arms but Prayers and tears unto God;
and Petitions to our King, which were utterly rejected; the Books and
corruptions against which we petitioned highly exalted, and by the insolent
advise of those who govern now his Counsels, labor to establish their own ill
acquired greatness upon our oppression, and the ruins of our Religion and
Liberties. We were forbidden to insist, under the pain of high Treason, when we
found our selves thus opposed and born down; still insisting in our humble
desires we solemnly renewed our solemn and National Oath and Covenant for
preserving of our Religion and Liberties, and of his Majesty's Authority,
knowing the violation of that Oath to be the guiltiness which had procured our
woes, and that our Repentance and turning to God were the means by his
blessing for a good success: when contrary to our deserving and expectation
his Majesty was moved by wicked Counsel to march toward us with an Army, we
choosed rather to neglect such courses as might serve for our humane safety,
then to fall in seeming disobedience to our King, or to give the smallest
distaste to our Brethren in England, and therefore disbanded our Forces,
delivered all holds which were craved in testimony of our obedience, and so
far complied with his Majesty's pleasure, that notwithstanding the
determination of our lawful former Assembly, called by his Majesty, we were
contented that a new free Assembly and Parliament should be appointed, where
all things both concerning our Religion and Liberties might again be
considered and established. When matters Ecclesiastical were determined in the
Assembly according to the Constitutions of the Church in the presence, and with
the consent of his Majesty's Commissioner, and the Parliament was conveened for
perfecting the war, although we walked therein so warily that no just
provocation was given to his Majesty, yet contrary to the Laws and Customs of
this Kingdom, the Parliament so certainly promised, when his Majesty was free
of those bad Counselors, was (being again in their power) by their advise
proroged, which to show our invinsible obedience we were content to suffer, and
did send up our Commissioners to London to render the reasons of our demands.
When our Commissioners and Petitions of the Parliament, called by his Majesty,
were so far rejected, that they were never seen or heard. We send up our
Commissioners again with our propositions, which contained nothing but what
was necessary for the peace and good of the Kingdom, and was granted to us
before under his Majesty's hand, yet could they find no answer at all which
will be wondered at, and hardly believed by so many as are strangers at Court,
and know not the Bishop of Canterbury, and the Leivtenant of Ireland, with the
Assistance of the too too powerful Faction of the Hispanioliz'd Papists labor
to show their zeal for his Majesty's greatness, by oppressing the just
Liberties of the free Subjects, and the reformed Religion in all the three
Kingdoms: But in place of the gracious answer which we expected, our
Commissioners were restrained, and one of the Noble men Imprisoned, Garrisons
of strangers set over our heads in an insolent and barbarous way, exercising
their cruelty even against Women and Children, our Ships and goods taken and
sunk, and the owners stripped naked, and more inhumanely used at the
Commandment of abused Authority, by the Subjects of our own King, then by
Turks and Infidels, and great Armies prepared against us with a terrible
Commission to subdue and destroy our selves, our Religion, Liberties, Laws and
all. In this extremity for us to send new Commissioners and Petitions were
against sense and experience, those that govern the Kings Counsels being
far from any inclination or intention to satisfy the just desires and
grievances of the Subjects, as they have made manifest by breaking up of the
Parliament in both Kingdoms, (though we know them to be often countervoted by
many of that Honorable Board, more candid and peaceably minded.) To sit still
in senselessness and security, waiting for our own destruction at the
discretion of our merciless enemies (which were it not at this time with the
cause of God would move us the less) is not only against Religion but Nature,
teaching and commanding us to study our own preservation. To endure continual
threatenings, and so great hostility and invasion from year to year, which is
the professed policy of our enemies is impossible, and when we have examined
our own strength, more then we are able to bear: We have therefore after much
agitation and debating with and amongst our selves; resolved to have our
procedings, which have been canvased by so many, and are brought to some point
of determination in our own Parliament, to be better known to the Kings
Majesty, and the world, and especially to the Kingdom of England, that against
all false and artificial relations, they being nakedly seen to be what they
are, we may obtain a better grounded and more durable peace for the enjoying
of our own Religion, and Laws; and as we desire the unworthy Authors of our
troubles, who have come out from our selves to be tried at home, and justice to
be done upon them according to our own Laws, so shall we press no further
process against Canterbury, the Lieutenant of Ireland, and the rest of those
pernicious Counselors in England the Authors of all the miseries of both
Kingdoms; then what their own Parliament shall discern to be their just
deserving. When we look upon this work of reformation from the beginning, and
perceive the impressions of the Providence of God in it, we are forced in the
midst of all our difficulties and distresses to bless God for his Fatherly
care and free love to his Church and Kingdom, and to take courage and spirit
to proceed in patience and perseverance whither he shall go before us, and
lead us on. When the Prelates were grown by their Rents and Lordly dignities by
their power over all sorts of his Majesty's Subjects, Ministers and others, by
their places in Parliament, Council, College of Justice, Exchequer and High
Commission, to an absolute Dominion and greatness, and setting the one foot
upon the Church, and the other upon the State, were become miserably insolent,
even then did the work begin, and this was the Lords opportunity. The
beginnings were small, and promised no great thing, but have been so seconded
and continually followed by divine providence, pressing us from step to step,
that the necessity was invincible and could not be resisted. It cannot be
expressed what motions filled the heart, what tears were powered forth from the
eyes, and what cries came from the mouths of many thousands in this Land at
that time, from the sense of the Law and power of God, raising them as from the
dead, and giving them hopes after so great a deluge and vastation to see a new
world, wherein Religion and Righteousness should dwell. When we were many times
at a pause, and knew not well what to do, the fears, the furies, the
peevishness and the plots of our dementat adversaries opened a way unto us,
and taught us how to proceed, and what they devised to ruin us served most
against themselves, and for raising and promoting the work. O providence to be
adored! Although neither Counsel nor Session, nor any other Judicature has
been all this time sitting, and there have been meetings of many thousands at
sometimes, yet have they been kept without tumult or trouble, and without
excess or riot in better order and greater quietness, then in the most
peaceable times have been found in this Land. When we were content at the
pacification to lay down Arms, and with great loss to live at home in pea^e,
our wicked enemies have been like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose
waters cast up mire and dirt, and will have us to do that which it seems the
Lord has decreed against them. The purity of our intentions far from base
and earthly respects, the bent and inclination of our hearts in the midst of
many dangers, the fitting of instruments, not only with a desire and
disposition, but with spirit and abilities to overcome opposition, and the
constant peace of heart accompanying us in our ways, which bears us out
against all accusations and aspersions, are to us strong grounds of assurance
that God has accepted our work, and will not leave us: we know the Lord may
use even wicked men in his service, and may fill their sails with a fair gale
of abilities, and carry them on with a strong hand, which should make us to
search our hearts more narrowly. But as this ought not to discourage his own
faithful servants, who out of love to his Name intend his honor, walk in his
ways, find his peace comforting them, his providence directing them, and his
presence blessing them in their affairs. So can it not be any just ground of
quarrelling against the work of God. Yet all these our encouragements which
have upholden our hearts in the midst of many troubles, could not make our
entry into England warrantable, if our peace (which we earnestly seek and
follow after) could be found at home or elsewhere. Where it is to be found we
must seek after it, and no sooner shall we find it clearly secured to us, but
by laying down our Arms, and by the evidences of our peaceable disposition, we
shall make manifest to the world, and especially to the Kingdom of England,
that we are seeking nothing else but peace, and that our taking up of Arms was
not for Invasion but for Defense. No man needs to plead by positive law for
necessity. It is written in every man's heart by nature, and in all actions we
find men have received it by practice, that necessity is a soveraignity. A Law
above all Laws is subject to no Law, and therefore is said to have no Law. Where
necessity commands, the Laws of nature and Nations give their consent, and
all positive laws are silent and give place. This Law has place, sometimes to
excuse, sometimes to extenuate, and sometime to justify and warrant actions
otherwise questionable: and no greater necessity can be then the preservation
of Religion, which is the soul of the Country, which is the body of our
lives; who are the members, and of the honor of our King who is the head. All
these at this rhyme are in a common hazard, and to preserve and secure all, we
know no other way under the Sun (And if any be so wise as to know it, we
desire to hear it, and shall be ready to follow it) but to take order with our
common enemies where they may be found, and to seek our assurance where it may
be given. The question is not whether we shall content our selves with our own
poverty, or enrich our selves in England? that question is impious and absurd.
Neither is the question whether we shall defend our selves at home, or invade
our neighbors and dearest Brethren? this also were unchristian and
unreasonable. But this is the question, whether it be wisdom and piety to keep
our selves within the borders till our throats be cut, and our Religion, Laws
and Country destroyed? Or, shall we bestirre our selves, and seek our
safeguard, peace and liberty in England, whether we shall do or dye, whether
we shall go and live, or abide and perish? Or more largely to express all,
Whether we who are not a few private persons, but a whole Kingdom, shall lie
under the burden of so many accusations, as scarcely in the worst times have
been charged against Christians, receive the Service Book, and the whole body
of Popery, embrace the Prelates and their abjured Hierarchy, renounce our
solemn Oath and Covenant, so many times sworn by us, loose all our labor and
pains in this Cause, and forget our former slavery and wonted desires of
redemption at the dearest rate, tickle the minds of our enemies with joy, and
strengthen their hands with violence, and fill the hearts of our friends with
sorrow, and their faces with shame because of us; desert and dishonor the
Son of God whose Cause we have undertaken, whose banner we heve displayed,
and whose truth and power has been this time past more comfortable to us, then
all the peace and prosperity of the world could have rendered, and draw upon
our selves all the judgments which God has executed upon Apostates since the
beginning, and shall we fold our hands and wait for the perfect slavery of our
selves and our Posterity, in our souls, bodies, and estates, and (which is all
one) foolishly to stand to our defense where we know it is impossible? Or sha1l
we seek our relief in following the calling of God (for our necessity can be
interpreted no less) and entering by the door which his providence has opened
unto us, when all ways are stopped beside. Our enemies at first did shroude
themselves so far under the Kings Authority, that they behooved to stand or
fall together, and that to Censure them was Treason against the King. Now we
have shown that a Kings Crown is not tied to a Prelates Mitre, and that the one
may be cast unto the ground, and the other have a greater luster and glory then
before. Now they take themselves to another starting hole, and would have men
to think that to come into England against them is to come against England,
and to pursue them although Legally is to invade the Kingdom where they live,
as if the the cutting away of an Excrescence, or the curing of an Imposthume
were the killing of the body. Let them secure themselves under the shelter of
their own fantasies, but we are not so undisserning as like mad men to run
furiously upon such as we first meet with and come in our way: for although it
cannot be denied but the wrongs done to us, as the breaking of the late peace,
crying us down as Rebels and Traitors, the taking of our Ships and goods, the
Imprisoning of our Commissioners; the Acts of Hostility done by the English in
our Castles: had they been done by the State or Kingdom of England, there
might have been just causes of a National quarrelling, yet seeing the Kingdom
of England conveend id Parliament have refused to contribute any supply against
us, have shown themselves to be pressed with grietances like unto ours, and have
earnestly pleaded for redress and remedy, and a Declaration, made that his
Majesty out of Parliament will redress them, which might be a cure for the
grievances of particular Subjects: but National grievances require the hand of
the Parliament for their cure, for preventing whereof the Parliament was broken
up and dissolved. Neither do we quarrel with the Kingdom for the injuries
which we sustain, but our quarrel is only with particular men, the enemies
of both Nations: nor can they quarrel with us, for taking order with the
prevalent Faction of Papists and Prelates the Authors of so many woes to both
Nations.

Let all who love Religion and their liberty join against the common enemies,
and let them be accursed that shall not seek the preservation of their
neighbor Nation, both in Religion and Laws, as their own, as knowing that the
ruin of one will prove the ruin both. And knowing well (as having from their
own Councels discovered it) that the ruin of both was intended, and that it
was ever their plot and purpose, that if they could not engage our dearest
Brethren, and neighbor Nation in a War for our destruction; then to give us
some ill assured peace, which might bind our hands and hold us quiet, until
the yoke of bondage were more heavily and unremoveably laid upon our Brethren
of England by the help of such an Army as was pretended to be gathered against
us, rooting out the Godly people and active spirits of that Nation and all
those who as good Patriots stand well affected to Religion, and their just
liberties, and might be suspected would dare stir for the defense and
maintenance of either, and there after easily find ground to break again with
us, when they were once assured that we were like to stand alone: And all the
benefit or our peace should be to be last destroyed.

And as we attest the God of heaven that those and no other are our intentions,
so upon the same greatest attestation do we declare that for atchieving those
ends, we shall neither spare our pains, fortunes, nor lives which we know
cannot be more profitably and honorably spent. That we shall not take from our
Friends and Brethren from a thread even to a shoe latchet but for our own
moneys, and the just payment: That we come amongst them as their Friends and
Brethren, very sensible of their bypast sufferings and present dangers both in
Religion and Liberties, and most willing to do them all the good we can, like
as we certainly expect that they (from the like sense of our hard condition and
intolerable distress which has forced us to come from our own Country) will
join and concur with us in the most just and Noble ways for obtaining their
and our most just desires. And when our own moneys and means are spent, we
shall crave nothing but upon sufficient surety of payment how soon possibly it
can be made, what is necessary for the entertaynment of our Army, which we are
assured so many as love Religion and the peace of both Kingdoms will willingly
offer, as that which they know we cannot want, and in their wise foresight will
provide the way to furnish necessaries, and to receive the surety. This course
being kept by both sides, will neither harm our Brethren (for they shall be
satisfied to the last farthing) nor our selves, who look for a recompense from
the rich providence of God, for whose sake we have hazarded the loss of all
things.

The escapes of some Soldiers (if any shall happen) we trust shall not be
imputed to us, who shall labor by all means prevent them more carefully, and
punish them more severely then if done to our selves, and in our own Country.
Our professed enemies the Papists, Prelates, with their adherents, and the
receivers of their goods and geir, we conceive will be more provident then to
refuse us necessary sustentation, when they remember what Council was given by
them for declaring all our possessions to be forfeited and to be disposed of to
them as well deserving Subjects.

We shall demand nothing of the Kings Majecty but the settling and secureing of
the true Religion and liberties of this Kingdom according to the Constitutions
and Acts of the late Assemblies and Parliament, and what a just Prince owes by
the Laws of God and the Country to his grieved Subjects, coming before him
with their humble desires and supplications. Our abode in England shall be no
longer time then in their Parliament, our just grievances and complaints may be
heard and redressed, sufficient assurance given for the legal trial and
punishment of the Authors of their and our evils; and for reforming and
enjoying their and our Religion and Liberties in peace, against the
machynations of Romish contrivance acted by their degenerate Contrymen. Our
returning thereafter shall be with expedition in a peaceable and orderly way
far from all molestation, and we trust the effect shall be against Papists,
the extirpation of Popery, against Prelates, the Reformation of the Church,
against Atheists, the flourishing of the Gospel, and against Traitors and
Firebrands; a perfect and dureable union and love between the two Kingdoms,
which he grant who knows our intentions and desires, and is able to bring
them to pass. And if any more be required, God will reveal it and go before
both Nations, and if God go before us who will not follow, or refuse to put
their necks to the work of the Lord?

FINIS.
