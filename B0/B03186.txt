An Excellent New SONG, CALLED, The Praise of Women. OR, Wine, Women and Music*
Being a Playhouse Song to a pleasant New Tune.
^HOw lovely's a Woman before she is enjoyed, when the Spirits are strong, and
the Fancy not cloyed, ^we admire every part, tho never so plain, which when
throly possessed we quickly disdain.

2
Each Lady we court, and beg they would be kind,
And when they consent for to be of our Mind,
We kiss and embrace and do what is to be done,
When their Beilies are full we leave them forlorn
3
All Women we see we do hope to enjoy,
We think our selves happy if they prove not coy,
Each Feature we praise and admire their parts,
Though to the next Face we do proffer our hearts.
4
So drinking we love too just at the same rate,
For when we are at it we foolishly prate;
What Acts we have done, and set up for Wit,
But next Morning's Pains our Pleasures do quit.
5
We drink all the Morning both Coffe and Tea,
And think there is none live more sober than we
'Till to dinner we move, then the glass must go round,
Full Bumpers of Wine till our senses are drowned.
6
Then about Midnight we reeling home go,
And neither the Watchmen or Constable know
Thus Wine make us valiant, for when we are dru^^
We draw at each Man for a nasty Town
