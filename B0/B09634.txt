ACADEMIA OXONIENSIS.
SAPIENTIAE ET FELICITATIS blazon of Oxford University
ROBERT SAY, Doctor of Divinity, Provost of Oriel College, and
Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford,
to all whom it may concern, Greeting.
Whereas the Statutes of the University require certain Scholastical, and
decent Habits, befitting every Person in his several Degree to be used, and
put on, when he shall appear in Public, especially at Sermons and other
Scholastical Exercises. And whereas, for some months last past, there has been
almost a total neglect, throughout the whole University herein, contrary to the
Statutes, and good Discipline of the same, We therefore (considering the
dishonor and suffering of the University by this apparent neglect; and the
many inconveniences which may ensue thereupon, if We shall not uphold that
Laudable Use and Custom) do Peremptorily, and expressly Require and Command
Every Graduate to appear in his Formalities, at Sermons, and elsewhere,
according to the Statutes therein provided. As also Vnder-Graduates to wear
such Gowns and Caps, as are limited, and expressed for their condition. And
that these commands may work the speedier redress; We profess to Execute the
rigor of the Statutes upon such as shall offend therein.

Given under my hand this Thirteenth day of February 1665/6. ROBERT SAY
Vice-Chan.
