THE West-Country Maids advice;
Here is a Song I send to you,
fair Maidens every one;
And you may say that it is true,
when I am dead and gone.
To the Tune of, Hey Boys, up go we.






FAir Maids draw near to me a while
and I Will my mind declare,
This song I hope will make you smile,
when once you do it hear:
For young men are so fickle grown,
and false in every way,
Their whole delight is day and night,
fair Maids for to betray.
Thus I would have fair Maidens all,
for to be Ruled by me,
Although your portions be but small,
to them do not agree:
For if a husband once you you get,
that should be cross to thee,
You Will then repent that e're you went
to Church to Married be.
Therefore keep close your Maidenhead,
which now you have in store,
For if you once should be misled,
you will not enjoy it more:
And then such troubles comes apace,
as you never thought upon,
And this will be your woeful case,
by taking of a man.




There was a Maid which well I knew,
was lately made a Bride,
Her Father gave her goods, it is true,
she a Portion had beside;
Yet this poor Lass did meet an Ass,
would always scold and brawl,
The other day he ran away,
and left Wife, Child, and all.
Therefore observe young Maidens all,
take heed how you do wed,
For you may quickly take a fall,
and bring a Knave to bed:
For Young Men are so fickle grown,
as I have here expressed,
It Is good to let them all alone,
a single life is best.
I say, by chance that you may meet,
a young man that is true,
Then you may count your Fortune great,
because there are so few:
Not one in ten, amongst young men,
is true I do protest,
I Will keep my self as I have been,
a single life is best.
Why should a Maid confined be,
to any man alive,
You shall have Snaps and Flouts you will fin^
when once you are made a Wife:
For husbands are so Hoggish grown,
there Wives shall take no rest,
Therefore let all young men alone,
a single life is best.
And now I have declared my mind,
I hope you will not me blame,
For to a Woman I am kind,
and Toby is my name;
And I do live in Devon-Shire,
to many it is well known,
I wish all Maids that do me hear,
be sure to hold their own.
And so I do conclude and end,
having no more to say,
Pray take the Author for your friend,
and for this Ballad pay:
A penny is the price of it,
you will say it is not dear,
And say it is a Ballad true,
came out of Devon-Shire.
FINIS.
