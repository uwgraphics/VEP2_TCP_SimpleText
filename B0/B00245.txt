The lovely Northern Less,
Who in the Ditty here complaining, shows
What harm she got milking her Daddies Ewes.
To a pleasant Scotch tune, called, The broom of Cowdon knows


THrough Liddersdale as lately I went,
I musing on did pass,
I heard a Maid was discontent
she sigh,d and said alas:
All maids that ever deceived was,
bear a part of these my woes,
For once I was a bonny Less,
when I milkt my daddies Ewes.
With O, the broom, the bonny broom
the broom of Cowdon knors,
Feign would I be in the North Country,
to milk my daddies Ewes.
My Love into the held did come.
when my daddie was from home,
Sugared words he gave me there,
praised me for such a one:
His honny breath and lips so soft,
and his alluring eye.
And tempting tongue has woed me off,
now forces me to cry.
All maids, etc.
He ioyed me with his pretty chat,
so well discourse could he,
Talking of this thing and of that,
which greatly liked me:
I was so greatly taken with his speech,
and with his comely making,
He used all the means could be,
to inchant me with his speaking,
All maids etc.
In Danby Forest I was borne,
my beauty did excel,
My parents dearly loved me,
till my belly began to swell:
I might have been a Princes peer,
when I came over the knoes,
Till the Shepherds boy beguiled me,
milking my dadies Ewes,
All maids, etc.
When once I fell my belly swell:
no longer might I abide
My mother put me out of doors,
and bange'd me back and side:
Then did I range the world so wide,
wandering amongst the knoes,
Cursing the boy that helped me,
to fold my daddies Ewes.
All maids, etc.
Who would have thought a boy so young,
would have used a Maiden so,
So to allure her with his tongue,
and then from her to go,
Which has alas procured my woe,
to credit his fair shows,
Which now to late repent I do,
the milking of the Ewes,
All maids that ever deceived was,
bear a part of these my woes,
For once I was a bonny Less,
when I milkt my dadies Ewes.
The second Part,
to the same tune.


ALL Maidens fair then have a care,
when you a milking go,
Trust not to young men's tempting tongus,
that will deceive you so,
Then you shall find to be unkind,
and glory in your woes,
For the Shepherds boy beguiled me,
folding my Daddies Ewes.
All Maids etc.
If you your Virgin-honours keep,
esteeming of them dear,
You need not then to wail and weep,
or your parents anger fear:
As I have said of them beware,
would glory in your woes,
You then may sing with merry cheer,
milking your daddies Ewes.
All Maids, etc.
A young man hearing her complaint.
did pity this her case,
Saying to her sweet beauteous Saint,
I grieve so fair a face
Should sorrow so, then sweeting know,
to ease the of thy wooes,
I Will go with thee to the North Country,
to milk thy daddies Ewes,
All Maids, etc.
Leander like I will remain,
still constant to thee ever,
As Pyramus, or Troyalus,
till death our lives shall sever?
Let me be hated evermore,
of all men that me knows,
If false thee Sweet heart I be,
milking thy daddies Ewes,
All Maids, etc.
Then modestly she did reply,
might I so happy be,
Of you to find a husband kind,
and for to marry me,
Then to you I would during life,
continue constant still,
And be a true obedient wife,
observing of your will.
With O the broom, the bonny broom,
the broom of Cowdon knoes,
Feign would I be in the North Country,
milking my daddies Ewes.
Thus with a gentle soft embrace,
he took her in his arms,
And with kiss he smiling said,
I Will shield thee from all harms,
And instantly will marry thee,
to ease thee of thy woes,
And go with thee to the North Country,
to milk thy Daddies Ewes.
With O the broom, etc.
FINIS.
