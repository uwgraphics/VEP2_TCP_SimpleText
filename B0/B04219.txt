Loves Carouse,
Or, The young men's Healths.
For diverse Young Men being merry,
They drank Healths to their Loves in Sherry.
Tune, Joans Placket, etc.


A Jovial crew of lively Lads;
all in a merry vain,
Did drink unto their sweethearts all,
their true loves to obtain
for men and maids,
to be Comrades
Is counted a gallant thing
and he that gains his Sweet-hearts love,
Conceits himself a King.
Let pottles fly
Drink barrels dry.
Whilst rivers fill with rain,
and when the bowl is passed round,
We Will drink to them again.
Come here is a health to bonny Besse,
that loves me with her heart,
She Will cast her eyes, up to the skies,
and knows her Mothers art
she will clip and kiss,
what harm is this,
Her Middle I can span,
it is her delight for to embrace
A loving hearted man.
Let pottles fly, etc.
Come here is a cup to nimble Nan,
whose cheeks are like a rose,
She Is sweet and neat, and kisses sweet
and like a Lady goes,
her forehead high,
and rolling eye
Has so entangled me
that I am taken cast, and thrown,
In loves captivity,
Let pottles fly
Drink barrels dry, etc,
I Will drink a health to Margery,
the Milk-maid frank and free
Who chanced to loose her maidenhead
alas what remedy,
A merry Less
may serve to pass
I Will take her for my own
there is more that does such Venus tricks
Although it is not known
Let pottles fly, etc.
Then hears a health to jumping Joan
whose Placket now is sound
For why the mending of the same,
has cost me twenty pound
she is right and straight,
(as well as Kate)
This I can justify,
for being lately underlaid
She Will tread no more a wry,
Let pottles fly,
Drink barrels dry:
Whilst rivers fill with rain
and when the bowl is passed round
We Will drink to them again.
The second part
to the same tune.


COme here is a bowl to smiling Sue
a Semster I know well
All sorts of needlework she makes
and cut work she can sell,
fine Sarah may,
give her the way
For none like her shall be
the firm injoyer of my heart
In love and unity.
Let pottles fly,
Drink barrels dry
Whilst rivers fill with rain
and when the bowl is passed round
We Will drink to them again
I Will drink a health to merry Moll
(alas I weep for Nelly)
Who chanced to leave this wicked world
being troubled with her belly
but Mary fair
whom I love dear
She is my only Joy,
we will wed, and bed: and hope to get
A lusty chopping boy
Let pottles fly, etc.
Come here is a glass to goodly Grace
a Virgin chaste and pure
Her beauty like the Sun more bright
and firmer will endure,
her scarlet hue
and veins true blew
Her skin like Lillies white
invites my heart to Cupids feast
To taste of loves delight,
Let pottles fly, etc.
I Will drink a Bowl to royal Rose
the Phoenix of them all
There Is no man can her honor pluck
but first their own must fall
a Virgin rare
more sweet then air
Is she whom I love best,
my heart within her heart is placed
And harbors in her breast,
Let pottles fly, etc.
Come here is a health to pretty Peg
a merry Country Less
Although her credit has been cracked
at London it shall pass
to quit all strife
she is my wife,
then make no more to do,
for I dare say that she will prove
Both fair and honest too,
Let pottles fly, etc.
I Will drink a glass to jolly Joyce,
the Mistress of my mind
Let others prattle what they will
no harm in her I find
If she will agree
to fancy me
(as other maidens do)
I Will quite wipe off all former scores
I marry and thank you too,
Let pottles fly, etc.
Come here is a health to all our Loves
I mean in general
The next shall be in Sherry Sack
for Clarret is too small,
Love shall abound
In drinking round,
And constant be for aie
Come Drawer filst' other quart
And tell us what is to pay
Let pottles fly
Drink barrels dry
Whilst rivers fill with rain
for when the bowl is passed round
We Will drink to them again
