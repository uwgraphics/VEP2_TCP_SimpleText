The wicked Midwife, the cruel Mother, and the harmless Daughter. OR, A
cruel Murder committed upon a newborn Child by the Midwife, whom the
Grandmother of the Child hired to kill, but unknown to the Mother of the
Child: Now the Mother of this Infant being falsely accused by her own Mother,
was executed at Lancaster Assize, at Midsummer last.
To the tune of, The bleeding Heart.


KInd Countrymen pray listen now,
And I Will declare that all may know
What chance in Lancashire befell,
With tears of woe the same I tell.
I well may speak in tears of woe,
The like vile deed I near did know,
But now in these our latter days,
Many offend in wicked ways.
Forth from the North comes heavy news,
As all may think by this insues:
My Pen must write of bloody crimes,
Which has been acted of late times.
There lived a Maiden young and fair,
Which many young men loved dear:
And him that she esteemed of best,
Did her most wrong of all the rest.
He with alluring charms beguild
This Maids, till she was got with child.
Now here begins this Maidens woes,
As the ensuing verses shows.
Now when the found she was defilde,
And that he had got her with child,
Then unto him she made her moan,
Desiring it might not be known.
Quoth he, sweet Heart, I Will marry thee
(...) as possible it may be
^

Then to her Mother she did go,
Entreating her it might be so,
But she vild woman it denide,
And said she should not be his Bride.
Daughter, quoth she, you are too young,
Therefore I charge you hold your tongue.
Seven years longer you shall carry
Before any young man you marry.
This answer still her Mother made,
Until she saw her Daughter fade,
By perfect tokens she did find,
What did torment her Daughters mind.
And then she her examined,
Who told the truth and near denide,
Poor Maid, with sorrow, grief, and care,
Unto her Mother did declare,
Desiring that she might be wed,
To him that gained her maidenhead:
But her vild Mother it denide,
Quoth she, for thee I will provide.
Thou shall not come to any shame,
For there is none shall know the same.
You shall securely live with me,
'Till that you safe delivered be.
Her time expired that she must be
B^ (...) of pain set free:

The second part,
To the same tune.


QVoth she I will give you five pound,
So I may find you just and sound,
To keep my counsel in this case,
And not declare't in any ways.
But first I Will have you for so swear,
Ere I to you will it declare,
In this thing that I do intend,
What you will prove my secret friend.
The Midwife made a solemn vow,
That none from her the same should know,
I you will pay me well for my hire,
I Will do any thing you require.
Why then quoth she, the cause is this,
My Daughter now in labor is,
And I do crave your help and skill.
My Daughter save, but her Child kill.
Quoth the Midwife, I will do so,
Then homewards they made haste to go,
Where they found her in extreme woes.
In stead of friends, they prove her foes.
Now being come to this poor souls.
Who durst not them for to control:
Yet thus her Mother still she prayed
For to have some more Women's aid.
But she would not thereto consent,
Because of her devilish intent.
They her delivered of a boy,
The which the Midwife bore away.
And as her Mother had decreed,
The Midwife wrought this horrid deed,
For she the pretty Babe did kill,
And buried it in a Dunghill.
They told the Mother of the Child
That she with it should not be toylde:
And ^^ther for to shun all blame.
^
Mother, quoth she, pray have a care
Of this my only Child so dear.
Daughter quoth she, be reconciled,
For I Will be careful of your Child.
The Midwife now for money comes,
Expecting to have the whole sums:
But she that should have paid the same,
Said, for her hire, she should have blame.
Quoth she, how could you have the heart,
To act so vile a bloody part?
I Will give you nothing for your hire,
Those speeches set her heart on fire.
Away she went thence presently,
Whereas the murdered Child did lie,
She takes it up and brings it home,
And laid it in a darksome room.
Then she to the old woman said,
Look in that room the Child is laid:
It will a witness be I doubt
Against your self when it cames out.
Now hearing of her to say so,
Into the rooms she strait did go,
The Child from thence she did convay,
Under the bed where her Daughter lay.
And then her neighbors she called in,
As though she had not guilty been:
Quoth she, my Daughter is most vild,
For she has murdered her Child.
Her Daughter being thus betrayed,
Desired Heavens to be her aid,
She scarcely did the same deny,
But she lamented bitterly.
