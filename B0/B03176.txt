An Excellent Ditty, called the Shepherds wooing Dulcina.
Tune is, Dulcina




AS at noon Dulcina rested,
in her sweet and shady Bower,
Came a Shepherd and requested,
in her arms to sleep an hour:
But from her look,
A wound he took,
so far that for a farther boon,
The Nymph he prays,
Wherefore she says,
Forgo me now, come to me soon.
But in vain she did conjure him,
for to leave her presence so,
Having thousand means to allure him,
and but one to let him go;
Where Lips invite,
And eyes delight,
and Cheeks as fresh as Rose in June,
Persuades to stay,
What boots to say,
Forgo me now, etc.
Words, whose hopes have now enjoined,
him to let Dulcina sleep,
Could a man's love be confined,
or a Maid her promise keep?
No, for her waste,
He held as fast,
as she was constant to her tune,
And still she spoke,
For Cupids sake,
Forgo me now, etc.
He demands what time or leisure,
can there be more fit then now;
She says, men may say their pleasure,
yet I of it do not allow.
The Suns clear light,
Shines more bright,
quoth he more fairer then the Moon,
For her to praise,
He loves he says,
Forgo me now, etc.
But no promise nor profession,
from his hands to purchase scope;
Who would sell the sweet possession
of such a beauty for a hope.
Or for the sight
Of lingering night,
forgo the pleasant joys of noon;
Though none so fair,
Her speeches were,
Forgo me now, etc.
Now at last agreed these Lovers,
she was fair and he was young,
If you will believe me I will tell ye,
true Love fixed lasts long:
He said my Dear,
My Love not fear,
bright Phoebus beams out-shines the Moon,
Dulcina prays,
And to him says,
Forgo me now, etc.




DAy was spent, and night approached
Venus fair was Lovers friend,
She entreated bright Apollo,
that his Steeds their race might end,
He could not say,
This Goddess nay,
But granted loves fair Queen her boon,
The Shepherd came,
To this fair Dame,
Forgo me now, come to me soon.
Sweet he said, as I did promise,
I am now returned again,
Long delay (you know) breeds danger,
and to Lovers breeds pain,
The Nymph said then,
Above all men,
Still welcome Shepherd morn or noon,
The Shepherd prays,
Dulcina says,
Shepherd I doubt you are come too soon.
When that bright Aurora blushed,
came the Shepherd to his dear,
Pretty Birds most sweet warbled,
and the noon approached near,
Yet still away,
The Nymph did say,
The Shepherd he fell in a swound,
At length she said,
Be not afraid,
forgo me now, etc.
With grief of heart the Shepherd hasted
up the Mountains to his flocks,
Then he took a Reed and piped,
echo sounded through the Rocks:
Thus did he Play,
And wished the day,
Were spent, and night were come ever noon,
The silent night,
Is Loves delight,
I Will go to fair Dulcina soon.
Beauteous Darling fair Dulcina,
like to Venus for her Love,
Spent away the day in passion,
mourning like the Turtle-Dove,
Melodiously,
Notes low and hye,
She warbled forth this doleful tune,
Oh come again,
Sweet Shepherd Swain,
Thou can not be with me too soon.
When that Thetis in her Palace,
had received the Prince of light,
Came in Corydon the Shepherd,
to his Love and hearts delight,
Then Pan did play,
The Wood-Nymps they,
Did skip and dance to hear the tune,
Hymen did say,
It Is Holy Day,
Forgo me now, come to me soon.
