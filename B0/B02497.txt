OLIVER, LORD PROTECTOR of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
considering, That whereas the exercise of the chief Magistracy, and the
Administration of Government within the said Commonwealth, is invested and
established in his Highness, assisted with a Council, And lest thereupon the
settled and ordinary course of Justice in the Commonwealth (if remedy were not
provided) might receive interruption, his Highness in his care of the State,
and public Justice thereof, (reserving to future consideration the reformation
and redress of any abuses by mis-government, upon better knowledge taken
thereof) is pleased, and does hereby expressly signify, declare and ordain, by
and with the advice and consent of his Council, who have power until the
Meeting of the next Parliament, to make Laws and Ordinances for the peace and
welfare of these Nations, where it shall be necessary, which shall be binding
and in force until Order shall be taken in Parliament concerning the same,
That all persons who on the 10. day of this instant Decemb^^ were duly and
lawfully possessed of any place of Judicature, or Office of Authority,
Iurisd^ction or Government, within this Commonwealth, shall be, and shall so
hold themselves continued in the said Offices and places respectively as
formerly they held and enjoyed the same, and not otherwise, until his Highness
pleasure be further known; And all Commissions, Patents, and other Grants,
which respect or relate unto the doing and executing of public Justice, and
all Proceedings of what Nature soever in Courts of Common Law, or Equity, or in
the Court of Admiralty, or by Commissioners of Sewers, shall stand and be in
the same and like force to all Intents and Purposes as the same were on the
said tenth day of this instant December, until further Order given by his
Highness therein. And that in the mean time (for preservation of the public
Peace, and necessary proceedings in matters of Justice, and for Safety of the
State) all the said Persons of whatsoever Place, Power, Degree, or Condition,
may not fail, every one severally, according to his respective Place, Office or
Charge, to proceed in the performance and execution of all Duties thereunto
belonging, as formerly appertained to them and every of them, whilst the former
Government was in being.
