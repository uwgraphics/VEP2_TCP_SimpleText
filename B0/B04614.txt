THE OLD WOMAN's RESOLUTION: OR, A Dialogue betwixt Jack Drumbold' and his Old
Granny Gregory; who Vowed she would Marry though Fourscore years and Ten
because she would Shoe her Horse round.
To the Tune of I marry and thank ye too:
Licensed according to Order.





THere was an old Woman then,
who had a great mind to Wed.
Who was full Fourscore years and Ten,
and had not a Tooth in her Head.
With Age she does grunt and groan,
each Night as she lies in Bed,
But yet a Husband's all her tone,
although not a Tooth in her Head.
She has a Grandson called Jack,
by whom she is often lead:
Quoth he, Do you a Husband lack,
and yet not a Tooth in your Head?
Why Sirrah, she then replied,
My Cheeks they are Crimson Red,
Therefore I hope to be a Bride,
I have a Colt's Tooth in my head.
Dear Granny, quoth Jack, not so,
your Face is like Winter dead,
Likewise your Hair's as white as Snow,
and not a good Tooth in your Head.
The Old Woman told him straight,
she would Cuff him for what he would said,
I must and will enjoy a Mate,
I have a Colt's Tooth in my Had.
Why Granny, quoth he, you're old,
and hardly can crawl to Bed,
Your Limbs is stiff, your Blood is cold,
and not a good Tooth in your Head.
Her Crutch straight she made him foel,
and likewise in a Passion said,
I am as nimble as an Eel,
and have a Colt's Tooth in my Head.
Good Granny, be not in a heat,
for you are too old to Wed;
Pray think upon a Winding Sheet,
you have not a good Tooth in your Head.
Why Sirrah, I amn't Fivescore,
and therefore I vow to Wed,
What! would you have me play the Whore?
I have a Colt's Tooth in my head.
Quoth Jack, Your alluring Charms,
must needs please a Man in Bed,
To have cold Death lie in his Arms,
you have not a good Tooth in your Head.
Quoth she, Are you Saucy still?
IN faith I will strike you dead;
But Rascal now say what you will
I have a Colt's Tooth in my Head.
Sometimes I am dull by chance,
but straight I am Cherry-red,
A Cogue will make me skip and dance,
I have a Colt's Tooth in my Head.
I have had Three honest Men,
which now are laid under Ground,
And though I am Fourscore and ten,
I reckon too shoe my Horse round,
Why then, said her Grandson Jack,
I will in a Bond be bound,
If you a Hazle-Nut can crack,
that then you shall shoe your Horse round.
Then she to her Trumps was put,
but straight a quere way she found
For with her Crutch she cracked the Nut,
because she would shoe her Horse round.
The Old Woman won the Day,
she caper'd an iuch from Ground,
I Will have a Husband by my Fay,
and then I shall shoe my Horse round.
FINIS.
