THE EXECUTION OF THE COVENANT, Burnt by the Common-Hang-man EDW. DVN,
Presbyter, May 22. 1661.
Published for the Use of Dr. B. and Mr. Notcrof, and the rest of the Rigid
Presbyterians.
THe News I pray! What does this Throng infer?
Do ye not know? DVN is turned PRESBYTER.
Well then! I see the Brethren in spite
Of BISHOPS, have obtained a PROSELITE;
One that will soon be on the Rigid Score,
And be a Cause of turning many more.
Make him an ELDER then! Indeed ye shall:
For he is one, that may Advance you all.
That he is now a BROTHER, you must grant,

And Anabaptists, that Heretic Crew
Of Presbyterian By-blowes; If these Flashes
Be Sacred to you, Come and Urn the Ashes:
For we esteem the Relics of these Sheets
Too dirty and debaucht to pave our Streets.
This Mouth-Granado, from that Scotch-witch came
To set three Glorious Kingdoms in a flame.
A Covenant? No, 'twas a Conspiracy,
Plotted by Brethren in Iniquity.
Bold Assassin's that durst attempt all ill,
And Holocaust whole Kingdoms to Self-will.
Mend, mend, for shame, your Brother else will look,
To hang the Authors, as he burned the Book.
But he presumes, or hopes, ye'l rather turn,
Than follow your black Juncto to the Urn.
While I thus thinking am, who would desire,
(Were it to Roast a RUMP) a fitter fire?
In which it now has pleased the Fates to grant,
