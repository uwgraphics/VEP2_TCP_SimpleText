The Scotch VVooing of WILLY and NANNY
To a pleasant new Tune: Or, Nanny O.
This may be Printed, R. P.



AS I went forth one Morning fair,
all in the midst of Summer spring,
There I did hear a young man lament,
and to himself began to sing,
It Is Nanny, Nanny, Nanny O,
The Love I bear to Nanny O,
all the World shall never know,
The Love I bear to Nanny O,
Her cheeks, her Cheeks, are lilly white,
and her eyes are like the Christial O,
She might have been a Lords delight,
and her name was called Nanny O,
It Is Nanny, Nanny, Nanny O,
The love I bear to Nanny O,
all the world shall never know,
The love I bear to Nanny O.




I will to her Fathers house,
and see what favor he will show,
That I may ride over you misty Moor,
all for to court my Nanny, O.
It Is Nanny O, etc.
I had rather have Nanny in her smock,
she is so blithe and bonny O,
As to have Betty with five thousand marks
if that she would but have me O.
It Is Nanny O, etc.
Come saddle me my Milk white steed,
the black was never so bonny O,
That I may Whip and ride with speed,
all for to court my Nanny O,
It Is Nanny O, etc.
Same says it is for Means I go,
but God forbid it should be so,
I go for nothing but pure Love,
the which I bear to Nanny O,
It Is Nanny O, etc.
Some pluck up the Finckel seed,
and some pull up the Tansie O,
A bonny boy to pull off my boots,
and to gang to Bed to Nanny O,
It Is Nanny O, etc.
The first time I did see my love,
it was in Tinmouth Castle O,
I thought she was and a bonny Lass,
and every Lad did think her so,
It Is Nanny O, etc.
Some takes delight in Cards and Dic^
and other some in Dancing O,
But I take delight in a bonny Lass,
and her name is called Nanny O.
It Is Nanny O, etc.
Now to conclude and make an end,
I hope there is no one Malice show,
To her that is such a bonny Lass,
whose name is called Nanny O,
It Is Nanny O, etc.
