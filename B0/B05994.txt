Strephon and Cloris: OR, The Coy Shepherd and Kind Shepherdess.
He Is fearful that his Flocks should go astray,
And from her kind Embraces would away;
But she with loving Charms does him so fetter,
That for to stay he finds it much the better:
When Flocks and Herds, and all concerns do fail,
Love must be satisfied, and will prevail.
To a pleasant New Playhouse Tune; Or, Love will find out the way.



Behold dread Cupid, with his Golden Dart,
And bended Bow, does pierce each Shepherds heart;
Witness here Strephon yields to Loves Essays,
His Head being Crowned with never-sading Bays.
AH! Cloris awake,
it is all abroad day,
If you sleep any longer
our Flocks they will stray:
Eye still my dear Shepherd,
and do not rise yet,
For it is a cold Windy morning,
and besides it is wet.
My Cloris make haste,
for it is no such thing,
Our time we do waste,
for the Lark is on wing
Besides I do fancy
I hear the young Lambs,
Cry, ba, ba, ba, ba,
for the loss of their Damms.
My Shepherds come,
though I Am all over sorrow
But I swear i will not love you
if you rise so to morrow:
For methinks it is unkind,
thus early to rise,
and not bid me good morrow,
bring tears from my eyes.
O hark, my dear Cloris,
before thou shall weep,
I Will stay to embrace thee,
neglecting my sleep:
My Flocks they may wonder,
one hour, two, or three,
But if I loose thy favor,
I ruined shall be.
I joy my dear Shepherd,
to hear thee say so,
It cases my heart of
much sorrow and woe:
And say thy reward
I will give thee a Kiss,
And then thau shall taste
of a true Lovers bliss.
But Cloris behold how
bright Phoebus his Beams,
Invites us to go
to the murmuring streams:
I bear the brave Nuntsman
does follow the cry,
And makes the woods ring,
yet how sluggish am I.
The Hounds and the Huntsman
may follow the Chase,
Whilst me enjoy pleasure
in a far better place:
Thou know my dear shepherd,
there is no delight,
Like Lovers Enjoyment,
from morning till night.
Alas my dear Cloris,
what vast thou require,
The care of my Flocks
does abate my desire:
The Lambs are new yeaned,
and tender for Pray,
And I fear the eye woolf
she should bear them away.
My Love do not fear it,
the woolf he is fled,
To take up his Lodging
in his Mossy bed:
Then let me embrace thee,
whilst me do agree,
And I promise to go.
thou shall after he free.
Ah Cloris! Thy words
are so powerful with me,
That I could be willing
to tarry with thee:
Therefore to content thee,
one hour I will stay,
But I vow by God Cupid
I will then go away.
Now I have my wishes,
dear Shepherd we will part,
Although thou do carry
away my poor heart:
I bless the great Gods,
that to Lovers are kind,
To bring us together,
such bliss for to find.
Then farewell dear Cloris,
till I see thee again,
For now I will haste to
my Flocks on the Plain:
Where I shall record
thy true Love in such, Rhimes
For Shepherds to admire
in succeeding times.
