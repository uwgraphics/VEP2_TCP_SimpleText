The Lovers Joy and Grief,
Or, A Young-mans Relation, in a pitiful fashion. Being from his Love hindered,
by Locks, Bolts, and Kindred.
To the Tune of Young men and Maids.


AMongst the nine, of Nymphs divine
that haunt the forked mountain:
If any will, bring me a quill
dipped in Castalia's fountain.
I Will show in brief, my joy and grief
and her due praises render:
To whom I would, come if I coould
but locks and bolts do hinder.
My joy, in that I had the fate
to choose so rare a jewel,
By grief in this, that she my bli^s
is kept by kindred cruel
Out of my sight, which day and night
does pierce my heart so tender,
It Is she to whom, I fain would come
but locks and bolts, etc.
She is a Less that does surpass
her neighbors round about her:
Her worth is such, it grieves me much
to live so long without her:
With strong desire, in Cupids fire
my heart burns to a cinder.
I would posses my happiness
but locks, etc.
As T^isbe fair by Parents care
from Pyramus was hidden,
So she to come abroad from home
i^ (...) ^^^bidden:
She dare not stir, nor I to her
so closely they have pined her
She would come out, I make no doubt
but locks, etc.
As Danae was, in the Tower of brass
enclosed by her father
So thee (my sweet) lest we should meet
art kept more closely rather
Yet as great Jove got to his love
though walls did comprehend her,
So I did hope to have free scope
but locks, etc.
In The interim I, most patiently
expect that happy season,
I dare not think, that she will shrink
for in truth I have no reason:
I find that she is true to me
in that I must commend her:
She would not be, so long from me
but locks, etc.
It grieves my heart, to think what smart
(poor creature) she endures,
What means her kindred use to win
her heart which she assures
Is fixed fast, while life does last
no policy can bind her,
To any course love has such fo^ce
but locks and bolts do hinder.


SHe has it is true, to speak what is due
too great a Marriage portion:
This may I vow, for Cupid now
is bent into extortion:
I would therefore, her friends were poor,
or else in heart more tender;
For poor or rich, weed go through stitch
but locks and bolts do hinder.
Although my self want worldly pelf
unto their expectation,
Yet if I may the truth display,
without any ostentation;
By birth and parts, and due deserts,
are not so weak and slender;
But that I might, earn any delight
though locks, etc.
Were I a Prince of eminence
and she a Peasants daughter,
Had she more, of Learnings store
then what wise nature taught her;
Her peerlesse face and in ward grace
shows in my heart such splendour
She mine should be, the like says she
but locks, etc.
It Is not her pelf, but her sweet self,
that I in heart do covet:
Necess^ty, let wealth supply
for nothing else I love it:
Her only love, is that does move
my heart and make it tender:
I mourn in grief, without relief
but locks, etc.
No ease of mind, at all I find
but only this assurance:
That my dear wench will never flinch
though she be kept in durance;
She has her share of woe and care,
for which I must commend her,
On me she has bestowed her faith,
though locks, etc.
Continue still in thy good will,
thou Paragon of beauty.
And I to thee as true will be
so am I bound in duty:
Though fortune frown, yet the renown
of our affections tender,
Abroad is flown, we two are one
though locks, etc.
With patience weeel expect to feel
the fruit of all this sorrow:
Though sorrow may, endure this day
I shall have joy to morrow:
In the mean while, I in exile
will be thy true defender
And spread thy name, which is my claim
though locks, etc.
Oh cruel fate, expire the date
of two dear Lovers trouble.
If once our grief do find relief
our joys will then be double:
And all our tears our cares and fears
will to our names add splendour,
Thy heart is mine, and mine is thine
though locks and bolts do hinder.
