A ^ost humble MEM^RANDUM From Peter Blondeau, Concerning the offers by him
made to this Commonwealth, for the coining of the money, by a new Invention,
not yet practiced in any State of the world; the which will prevent
counterfeiting, casting, washing and clipping of the same: Which Coin shall be
marked on both the flat sides, and about the thickness or the edge; of a like
bigness and largness, as the ordinary coin is: and will cost no more then the
ordinary unequal Coin, which is used now.
SInce it has been the pleasure of the Parliament and of the Council of State,
to pass some Orders in relation to the preventing of the counterfeited and
clipped money, now dispersed in England, Scotland and Ireland, he make's bold,
yet with submission, to present the following particulars, containing, besides
the said offers, First, the reason why the Coin (...) this Commonwealth is
clipped and light, so that few pieces are to be found ^eighing their true
weight; As also the ^^ason why so much falls Coin is now dispersed. And
secondly, the only way to remedy the said inconveniences, and to settle a
good and constant order in the Mint.

As to the first, the reason of the said abuses is because the money coined with
the hammer is so easy to be counterfeited, and with so few Engines and so
little expenses, that thereby the false Coyners are encouraged and their number
increased. And the daily experience to this day showed, that seldom or never
any falls Coyners have been discovered by the nois of the hammer.

Another reason is, because the money coined with the hammer, cannot be made
exactly round, nor equal in weight and bigness, and is often grossly marked,
and has many other faults, which give's a great facility to the false Coyners
to counterfeit and mould it; as also to the Clippers to clip it: It being very
hard to dis^ ^^^ween a clipped piece, and one not c^^^^^d. Besides, abundance
of coin is ma^e too light even at the Min^: The said Blondeau himself has
received some ^^illings (which he showed to the Committee for the Mint) which
weighed some five, some six, and some seven pence only; as to the contrary, he
received some that weighed seventeen, yea, and eighteen pence; both of them made
so at the Mint: Which inequality occasions several Goldsmiths and others, who
receiv the money from the Mint, to cull or pick out the heaviest pieces to melt
them; and after them, others do again cull or pick out the heaviest of them
that are left, to transport them beyond Seas; so that only the light, the false
and the clipped money remain's within the State, which turn's to the great
ruin and destruction of Commerce, and undoeth those poor people, who spend
their money little by little; for having some counterfeited or clipped pieces,
they cannot put them off, but are forced to sell them, with loss, unto the
Goldsmiths and others who can spend them among other moneys, or trade therein,
and sell them again to the Ca^^ ^^epers of the Treasurers, Bankiers, ^erchants
and others, who make them pass afterward among other moneys; so that they
return again into the ha^^s of the poor.

The reason why the workmen of the Mint do make the coin thus unequal in
weight, and do not care to keep the true weight, is because it is sooner don.
Besides, the said workmen may coin sometimes their own silver, or may treat with
those that bring their Bullion to be coined, because they do not render the
coin by tale, but by the pound, and so still there be more pieces in number,
then there should be in a pound. And the money so coined being distributed
out of the Mint, the officers themselves and the workmen of the Mint do cull or
pick out the heaviest pieces to melt them again, as they themselves have
confessed before the said Committee for the Mint. And that is the thing which
among themselves they call the mystery or secret of the Mint, and which is the
cause that, by themselves and by their friends, they make use of all their joint
power and credit, and will lay ou^ all (...) Estate, and leav no stone
unmooved to ^der the changing of the way of coining the money.

As to the way of remedying those inconvenien^es, and settling a good and
constant order in t^^ Mint, it cannot be done but by (...) ^ay propounded by
the said Blondeau, by marking the coin not only on both the flat sides, but
also upon the thickness or the edges.

The coin made after that way, cannot be clipped without taking away the marks
that are about the thickness, the which would be easily perceived. Besides,
the pieces will be of an equal bigness and largeness; the half-crown of the
ordinary weight and bigness, the shilling and other pieces accordingly; and so
equal among themselves, that it will be impossible to take the less thing from
any of them, but it will show less then the rest, and so will become not
current: They cannot be altered by washing or any other way, but they will
lose their bigness etc glass, so that a blindman will easily feel it.

The ordinary coin marked only on both the flat side^ (...) ^ee molded, as
the experience do ^^^w by the great quantity of falls coyn^ (...), ^ded, which
is current now; but ^^e Co^ it is marked on the thickness or edges, the marks
about the said edges can no way be molded. And though they could, yet in that
case they ought to be fyled after round about, specially in the place where it
has been cast, to take away the superfluous metal; which fyling cannot be don
without spoiling and taking away the said marks about the edges, and
consequently made easily known not to be current.

The money ought to be adjusted piece after piece, equal in weight, both Gold
and Silver. And for that end, it is requisite that an Officer be appointed in
the Mint, whose charge should be to weigh the money piece after piece when it
is finished; and in case he finde's any piece unequal or unhandsomly made, he
ought to reject it and give it to be melted again, upon the charges of the
Undertaker of the Mint, thereby to oblige him to be so much the more careful:
And for to hinder the connivence of the (...) appointed to weigh the said
piece^ who might happen to juggle with (...) Undertaker; another Officer may
(...) ^ppointed, to whom any of the people that shall find any of the new
coined pieces lighter then it should be, might repair within a convenient
time, who shall change the said light pieces, all which shall be put to
account to the said Officer appointed for the weighing: But that cannot be don
except the money be coined after the said Peter Blondeau's way, that is,
marked on both sides, and upon the edges; else the Weigher might pretend it had
been clipped and made light since it went out of his hand And the money being
coined after the said way, besides the hindering or removing of the aforesaid
inconveniences, it will raise or encreas the Exchange by about ten per centum,
to the advantage of this Commonwealth.

It is also requisite, to maintain the standard or goodness of the coin, that
any Goldsmith, Refiner, or other whomsoever be permitted to make essay of the
current money; and in case it be not found of the standard or goodness, they
might be allowed (...) ^^ck to an appointed Officer, t^ (...) and the rest of
the pieces by them (...) ^o be there tried again before (...) ^^missioners,
and the Trier of (...) Mint; and if it be found that the said coin be not of
the due goodness, the discoverer shall be rewarded at the charges of the
Trier, that he may have a due care, that no coin com's out of the Mint but
such as shall be of a due value, and according to the order of the State.

The Council of State being willing to prevent the said disorders, was desirous
to have the money of this Commonwealth well coined; and therefore having seen
the patterns of coin made after a new Invention by the said Blondeau, and
having treated by Letters about the quantity of pieces that could be coined
in a week, and what they might cost; the said Council, caused the said Blondeau
the Inventor of that way of coining, to com to London, to treat with him by
word of mouth, and to agree about the price of coining the money of this
Commonwealth after his way. He being then arrived at London (...) ^ce
September. 1649. the said Cou^ ^ced on him 40l sterling, and the late M^ Frost,
then Secretary to the said Cou^ told him before Witnesses, that (...) State
could not agree with him a^^^^ ^he price, and that therefore he shou^^ be
necessitated to retire himself, the State would indamnifie him for his journie,
both coming and returning, and for the time he should have lost, and would
bestow on him such a present, that he would return satisfied. A while after,
the said Council of State ordered the Committee of the Council of State for the
Mint to hear the said Blondeau's Proposition, and report it to the said Council.

The Committee for the Mint accordingly took into consideration, whether the
said Blondeau should be admitted to coin the money of this Commonwealth; and
having debated it, they resolved and approoved that he should be admitted
thereunto, provided his coin and his Proposition should be advantageous to the
State.

Afterward the said Committee having seriously considered and examined all the
circumst^^^^^ (...) way of coining propound^^ (...) said Blondeau, and having
h^ all the Objections that could be all^ against it, both by the Master,
Offi^^^^ (...) workmen of the Mint or by an^ (...) of those who appeared in the
^ upon debate of the whole, the said Committee concluded and Voted, that the
said way of coining propounded by the said Blondeau, was better, more
advantageous and more honorable for the State, then that which is used now in
this Commonwealth.

The Master, the Officers and the workmen of the Mint told the Committee, it
was not likely the said Blondeau had don himself, the pieces sent by him to the
Council of State. Besides, that it was an old Invention, which they knew
themselves, and that such pieces were only made for curiosity, with very long
time and great expense, and that it was impossible, that that way might be
used about the ordinary coin, which is thin. They desired that the said
Blondeau might be commanded to make a trial of his skill by making some other
pieces, and that they would do as much as the said Blondeau. Therefor the said
Committee ordered both the said Blondeau and the said workmen t^ mak^ their
patterns and Propositions ^^^^^ctively; and that he that would (...) ^t with
most advantage to the St^^^ (...) ^ld have the Employment.

At the time app^ (...) workmen brought to the Committee ^om pieces made after
the old way, which is known to them, and some big pieces of Silver, stuffed
within with copper; but they had drawn no Propositions.

Likewise the said Blondeau brought in about 300 pieces, some half-crowns of the
ordinary weight and bigness, some shillings, sixpences, and some Gold pieces,
and presented his Proposition, which having been reformed according to the
pleasure of the said Committee, it was received and accepted of by the whole
Committee, who ordered it to be reported to the Council of State, according to
the order of the said Council.

The said Committee having then taken into consideration the big pieces of
Silver at the outside, and stuffed within with copper (made with the Engines
that are at the To^, and well understood that the ^^id pieces, because they are
made (...) ^^^eral pieces at the top o^e of (...) will give no sound ^o th^^
(...) man can easily discer^ tha^ (...) ^s; and having weighe^ (...) and great
cost required (...) each piece; because the (...) 4 pieces, namely one of cop^^^
and one of Silver at the top, another underneath and one about, the which ought
to be adjusted and sodered together, besides several other fashions, which
cost more then the price of the lawful pieces; having also considered the great
and heavy Engines, and great number of tools and of men required for making of
one piece, the great charges for the Engines and tools and several other things
required for making of those counterfetted pieces, they acknowledged that it
would be enough to dissuade any one from undertaking it; the rich not being
willing, and the poor being unable; and that though they should undertake it
they could not do it without being discovered. Besides, that the money coined
after the wa^^ of the said Blondeau was so thin, (...) it cannot be so
counterfeited.

Whereupon it (...) ^ble, that the said workmen of (...) although they made use
of (...) ^d heavy Engines, that are in (...), yet for making of some Tools (...)
^eed of, and for the other charges ^^^^^yning about a dozen of pieces, they
made then for a pattern, have spent 100 l. st. as he that pretend's to have
laid out the money has said before witnesses.

Afterward, another order was given by the said Committee, and some time
limited to the said workmen, to draw and present their Proposition for coining
of the money marked upon the thickness or edge, as that of the said Blondeau
is; But after the exspiration of the long time demanded by them, they brought
such a Proposition, that the said Committee having read it over and over, could
not understand it, nor the sens of it; and even those that brought it could not
explain it; whereby it was apparent to the said Committee, that they were not
able to mak^ their Proposition good, much less ^n the money after that way;
whi^^ ^^^y avowed themselves before the (...) ^^mmittee. Yet they intreate^
(...) ^^^mittee to allow them the (...) months more to find, if (...) ^^w
invention, and that (...) ^^^^^eau's Proposition should (...) ^cated unto them,
upon which (...) ^ight frame their own. They further demanded that the said
Blondeau and the Graver, should have order to bring in all the pieces made by
the said Blondeau for a trial, with the stamps or dices used for making of
them; All which was granted them, upon that condition, that if within the time
allowed them, they could find out the means to coin the money after the said
Blondeau's way, and that thereupon he should be sent back, he should be
indamnified, which was agreed by all. But they could never find out the said
new Invention for coining the thin and weak pieces after that way with
expedition requisite. Yet for all that, they made their Propositions, which are
in the hands of the Chairman of the Committee, as are also the Blondeau's
Prop^^^^^^n and patterns, about a year and a (...), to be reported by him to
the Coun^ (...) State.

The workmen (...) ^nt have given to understand (...) 200 poor families, which
(...) ^^^ined by the work of the Min^ (...) ^esides truth. For some Officers o^
(...) Mint have told before witnesses, that for ^^rly their Corporation was at
the most of 40 Masters, and that at this time they are hardly 30 Masters, w^^^^
^re all rich, have lands or houses, and other ways of maintenance, without the
work of the Mint. And that when they had much money to coin, they were wonted
to hire some journie-men, giving to some 18 pence, to some 15 and to some 12 for
half a days work. Besides, in case the State admits of the said Blondeau to
coin the money after his way, and the workmen be willing to work after the
said way, he will oblige himself to teach them and pay them a reasonable
price.

The said Blondeau does not intend to have the Gold nor the Silver in his
custody, but only the charge of working the same, by such persons as the
State shall be pleased (...) thereunto.

He shall not (...) ^^^wer to admi^ any one to the (...) ^he Mint, without the
cons^ (...) ^bation of the State.

Nor w^ (...) keeping of the Dices or (...) ^y shall be entrusted in the (...)
^uch as the State shall adm^ wo^.

In a word, he does generally submit to whatsoever the S^ shall think
reasonable. Only (...) prays to consider, that

1. The exact equality, that will be effected by this way and invention of
the said Blondeau, will hinder and avoid all the known corrupt Practices about
coining. 2. The charge of the State concerning the same, considering all
circumstances, will be less then in the old way; and the honor of this
Commonwealth much the greater, in having their moneys coined in perfection,
above, or beyond any other State now known. 3. The said Blondeau came to London
about 3 years and a half since, and has no other employment here, but to
attend the pleasure of the State.
FINIS.
