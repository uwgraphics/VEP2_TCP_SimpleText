A Lamentable Ballad of the Ladies Fall.
Declaring how a Gentlewomen through her too much trust came to her end, and
how her Lover slew himself.
The Tune is, In Pescod time.




MArk well my heavy doleful Tale,
you Loyal Lovers all.
And heedfully bear in your breast
a gallant Ladies fall:
Long was she wooed e're she was won,
to lead a wedded life,
But folly wrought her overthrow,
before she was a wife.
Too soon alas she gave consent
to yield unto his will,
Though he protested to be true,
and faithful to her still:
She felt her body altered quite,
her bright hue waxed pale,
Her fair red cheeks turned color white,
her strength began to fail.
So that with many a sorrowful sigh,
this beauteous Maiden mild,
With grievous heart perceived her self
to be conceived with Child:
She kept it from her fathers sight,
as close as close might be,
And so put on her silken gown,
none might her swelling see.
Unto her Lover secretly
she did her self bewray,
And walking with him hand in hand,
these words to him him did say:
Behold, said she, a Maids distress,
my love, brought to thy how,
Behold I go with Child by thee,
but none thereof does know.
The little Babe springs in my womb
to hear the Fathers voice,
Let it not be a Bastard called
since I made thee my choice:
Come, come, my love, perform thy vow
and wed me out of hand,
O leave me not in this extreme,
in grief always to stand.
Think on thy former promise made,
thy vows and oaths each one,
Remember with what bitter tears
to me thou made thy moan:
Convey me to some secret place,
and marry me with speed,
Or with thy Rapier end my life,
e're further shame proceed.
Alas my dearest Love, quoth he,
my greatest joy on earth,
Which way can I convey thee hence,
without a sudden Death.
Thy friends they be of high degree,
and I of mean estate,
Full hard it is to get thee forth
out of thy Fathers gate.
Dread not thy self to save my fame;
and if thou taken be,
My self will step between the Swords,
and take the harm on me:
So shall I escape Dishonor quite,
If so I should be slain,
What could they say? but that true love
did work a Ladies Bane.




ANd not fear any further harm,
my self will so devise,
That I will go away with thee,
unseen of mortal eyes:
Disguised like some pretty Page,
I Will meet thee in the dark,
And all alone I Will come to thee,
hard by my Fathers Park.
And there, quoth be, I Will meet my love,
If God do lend me life,
And this day month without all fail,
I will make thee my wife:
Then with a sweet and loving kiss,
the parted presently,
And at their parting brinish tears,
stood in each others eye.
At length the wished day was come,
whereby this lovely Maid,
With lovely eyes, and strange attire,
for her true lover staid:
When any person she espied,
come riding over the plain,
She thought it was her own true love,
but all her hopes were vain.
Then did she weep and sore bewail,
her most unhappy state,
Then did she speak these woeful words,
when succourless she sat:
O false forsworn and faithless wretch,
disloyal to thy love,
Ha^^ thou forgot thy promise made,
and will thou persue'd prove.
And east thou now forsaken me,
in this my great distress,
To end my days in open shame,
which thou might well redress:
Woe worth the time I did believe,
That flattering tongue of thine,
Would God that I had never seen,
the teard of thy false Eyne.
And thus with many a sorrowful sigh,
homewards she went again,
No rest came in her watery Eyes,
she felt such bitter pain.
In travel strong she fell that night,
with many a bitter throw,
What woeful pangs she felt that night,
does each good woman know.
She called up her waiting Maid,
that lay at her Beds seet,
Who musing at her M^stris woe,
did strait begin to weep:
Weep not, said she, but shut the door,
and windows round about,
Let none bewail my wretched case,
but keep all persons out.
O Mistress call your Mother dear,
of women you have need,
And of some skilful Mid-wives help,
the better you may speed:
Call not my Mother for thy life,
nor call no women here,
Tho Mid-wives help comes now too late,
my death I do not fear.
With that the Babe sprang in her Womb,
no Creature being nigh,
And with a sigh that broke her heart,
this gallant Dame did dye:
This living little Infant young,
the mother being dead,
Resigned his new received breath,
to him that had him made.
Next morning came her Lover true
affrighted at this news,
And he for sorrow slew himself,
whom each one did accuse:
The mother with the new born Bebe,
were both laid in one grave,
Their Parents overcome with woo,
no joy of them could have.
Take heed you vainty Damsels all,
of flattering words beware,
And of the honor of your name,
have you a special care:
Too true alas this story is,
as many one can tell.
By others harms learn to be wise;
and thou shall do full well.
