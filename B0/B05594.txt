Our Service, We have now thought sit to put an end to that Our Parliament, by a
Dissolution thereof; Do therefore with Advice of Our Privy Council, hereby
Dissolve Our said present Current Parliament, and Declare the same to be
actually Dissolved. And that Our Royal Pleasure herein may be known, Our Will
is, and We Charge you strictly, and Command that incontinent these Our Letters
seen, ye pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and all other places needful,
and there in Our Royal Name and Authority, by open Proclamation, make
Publication of Our Dissolving of Our said present Current Parliament, and that
the same is actually Dissolved.
