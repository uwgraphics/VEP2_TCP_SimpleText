The true Lovers Joy: OR, The Reward of Constany BEING, An Amorous Diaologue
between a Seaman and his Love:
The Maid implores the aid of Charon's Boat,
That to the gloomy shades her soul might float;
With sighs and groans, much weary and oprest,
At length he heard her moan, and gave her rest
From all past dangers, and from future harms,
She safe arrived, and anchored in his arms.
To a New Tune, much in Request.


Maid. HArk Charon, come away,
bring forth thy Boat and Oars,
And carry me poor harmless Maid
unto the Elysium Shoars.

Charon. Who calls Charon in have,
whilst I sit here in pain
I carry none but pure and chaste,
such as true Love has slaie.
I come dear soul I come,
thy face does so incharm me,
Come in my Boat and take thy room,
neither wind nor wave shall harm thee.

Maid. Now I am come in thy Boat,
I am a Maid undone,
Sighing my heart is almost broak,
for my Love he is from me gone and
Thus as I pass the shades,
i will tell you a mournful tale,
So full of sighs as we do pass,
shall serve us for a gayl.
And so beguild the time,
i will sing you a true Loves song,
Mine eyes shall show a Sea of tears
to carry the Boat along.




What Is become of those hard hearts,
of a Virgin takes no pity,
They Are sailing to Virginny parts,
where Neptune has built a City.
O Cupid has wounded me,
and has pierced my tender heart,
To call for one whom I loved so dear,
who cares but little for it.
Thus in the shades below,
we will waste the tedious hours,
No gusts of winds, but sighs shall blow,
the Boat with Charons Oars.

His Answer. Stay gentle Charon stay,
and let thy Boat alone,
Row not the harmless Maid away
that sits and makes her moan.
For she that calls so fast,
and sighs so at thy stay,
A Virgin is as pure and chaste.
as e're true Love did slay.
She Is no dear soul for thee,
let not her face incharm thee,
Though room within thy Boat there be,
her beauty there may harm thee.
O fair one, if you go,
i am more undone than you,
My heart does equal sorrow know,
and still my Love is true.
The shades you must not pass,
nor mournful stories tell
Instead of sighing gales, alas!
a kiss will do as well.
You Would better stay ashore,
and sing us a true Loves song,
There Is Sea enough he needs no more,
to carry his Boat along.
No heart so hard I know,
but would gladly ease your pain,
Else let him to Virginny go,
and never return again.
If Cupid has wounded you,
he had wounded me before,
If you love as you say you do,
I love you as much or more.
In Beds of softest Down,
we will spend the short lived nights,
No gusts of wind or sighs shall drown
the current of our delights.

Maid. Come gentle Charon come,
and me to shore remove,
The wind dispairing sighs did blow,
shall waft me unto my Love.
How flow the Boats-mans tears,
if he no faster ply,
My Love to rid me of my fears,
shall lend me his wings to fly.
To thee dear Love I float,
finding thee just and true.
And bid to Charon and his Boat,
eternally adieu.
Make haste, make haste my Dear,
for if thou longer stay,
Thorough the floods without all fear,
my Arms shall make their way.
Welcome my love to shore
I Will keep thee now from harms,
And thou shall ride forever more,
at Anchor in my Arms.
