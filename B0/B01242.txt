By the King.
WHereas we did lately prorogue our Parliament till the ninth day of November
now next coming: Forasmuch as the Sickness has of late somewhat increased in
and about our City of London, by reason whereof we have already by our
Proclamation published the adiournement of part of Michaelmas Term now at
hand, The same cause does much more require the proroguing of the Parliament,
lest so great a concourse of people as the Term and Parliament (holding at one
time) must draw together, should give occasion to continue or spread the
Infection, both in the City it self, and other parts of the Realm, which our
care is to prevent. We have therefore thought fit, to prorogue our said
Parliament again until the ninth day of February now next ensuing, At which
day our purpose is (God willing) to hold the same, And do therefore hereby
give notice to all whom it may concern, that they may frame their affairs
accordingly, and attend at the same ninth day of February to that Service.

Given at our Honor of Hampton Court the six and twentieth day of September,
in the seventh year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.

ANNO 1609.
