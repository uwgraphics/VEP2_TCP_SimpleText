Andrews REPENTANCE, Sounding Alarm, To Return from his sins unto Almighty
God.

Perfectly guiding all those that hope to be saved, in the direct way of
Repentance, whereby they may attain eternal life: newly made in the Autumn
or declining of his age.

Sero sed serio.

Wherein is contained, not only what Repentance is, and the necessity thereof;
but also (for the better satisfying of the doubtful,) here is so plain a
resolution, concerning the assurance of the penitent man's salvation, and that
so directly penned, with proofs of holy Scripture, according unto the Word of
God; that I hope there is not the least doubt to be made of it by any man, (if
there be never so little of Gods grace in him,) but upon his true repentance,
he may be assured of his salvation, and certainly know whether he shall be
saved or damned.

Christian Readers, I do here dedicate and direct this my Book unto all you
that are the elect children of God, desiring through Jesus Christ, your health
in the Lord.
GOod Christian Readers, Treatises or Books of this kind we have too few; but
of lascivious too many: and whereas I have formerly published unto the view of
the world, many small books, for the setting forth of Gods glory, the
discharge of my conscience, and the benefit of you the children of God, in the
which I desired not the praise of men, seeing it is but vanity, neither did I
look for preferment, the world is so corrup^ed: for I here openly protest, I
fear none but God, whose truth I teach, and hate nothing but sin, which is
the destruction of the soul; neither do I care for my life, so it were lost
in the defense of the Gospel.

And now seeing that my former books are so vendible, and so well liking unto
the children of God, that in short time there have been diverse impressions
printed, I have therefore now set forth another book, entitled Andrews
Repentance: which I made and composed for mine own private use, intending to
engrosse it to my self.

And although it came forth last, which should have been first, yet
notwithstanding, whereas it is sero, yet it is serio.

And being made in the autumn, or declining of mine age, yet I doubt not by
the help of God, but it will continue the whole time of my life: hoping you
will grace me with your favorable suspense, until my deeds prove my doctrine.
And withal, I most entirely desire you, and every one of you, (even for my
Savior Jesus Christ his sake) that shall gather any spiritual comfort to cure
your souls out of these my labors, to pray unto our Lord Jesus Christ for me,
to give me his grace to return unto him by speedy repentance, and therein to
guide me with his Word, and direct me by his holy Spirit, that what I either
preach or write, I may both in life and doctrine express, and perform the
same unto my lives end, that whilst I endeavor to raise others, I may raise my
self, from all my sins, unto the glory of Gods holy name and the salvation
of my own soul. And so do for me an earnest repentant sinner, even as you
your selves, toward your selves, expect from Jesus Christ. Valete in Christo.

Yours toward you, as I would you should be for me, John Andrews Preacher of
Gods Word.

Andrews Repentance, Sounding Alarm, to return from his sins unto Almighty
God.
The first Chapter treaterh of the certainty of man's salvation; wherein he may
clearly see, whether he shall be saved or damned; with a most perfect rule
directed by the holy Scripture, to guide him in the right way to avoid his
sins; and how to attain eternal life.
ALmighty God, Genesis 17.1.
that sees from everlasting to everlasting, Eccles. 39.20.
and knows all things, both past, present, and to come; 1 Samuel 2.3.
has from the beginning of the world, and does to the end thereof Esaias 59.21.
Ier. 32.37. Genesis 17.7. Acts 2.39. Ier. 31.33. Heb. 10.16, 17. Ezech. 18.21, 22.
Ier. 24.7, 8, 9, 10.
gather, and preserve unto himself, by his hnly Spirit, Mat. 16.17
out of all Nations, the flower of all mankind, to be an holy company of
chosen people Ioh. 10.28, 29, 30. Tit. 2.14.
preserved for eternal life, whom nothing can separate from God but sin,
Esaias 59.2
and nothing sooner than to despair of his mercy, which is over all his works
Psalm. 143.9
.

And therefore all you that would forsake your sins to be the children of God,
must have an assured trust, Heb. 11.17. Iam. 1.6. Ephesians. 3.12. Romans 10.10.
kindled in your hearts by the Holy Ghost, Ioh. 6.29. Mat. 16.16, 17. 2 Cor.
4.13.
through the Word Romans 10.17 Romans 1.16. Acts 10.44.
whereby you may be assuredly resolved, Rom 1.17. Gal. 3.11. Gal. 2.16.
that remission of sins, and everlasting life, is not given unto others only,
but unto you also: and that you must have a true and lively faith in Jesus
Christ, to believe that you are his Romans 3.21, 22, 24. Gal. 1.15, 16. Ephesians.
2.8, 9. Phil. 3.9.
. Although your conscience accuse you; and Satan allege against you; that you
have not kept Gods Laws; but have grievously sinned Romans 3.9, 10, 11, 12. Romans
7.23.
, and provoked Gods wrath against you, whereby you have deserved eternal
damnation, yet notwithstanding, if by your true repentance, having an inward
sorrow wrought by the Holy Ghost Mat. 16.17. Ioh. 10.28, 29.
, for your sins before committed; you may embrace the benefits of Jesus
Christ by a lively faith Ioh. 3.18.
, with a full determination to continue in newness of life, yea, and that with
a pure conscience and persuasion of mind 1 Ioh. 2.2.
, that the full and perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of
Christ 1 Ioh. 2.1.
without any righteousness of yours, Tit. 3.5. Ezech. 36.22
but of the mere mercy of God Romans 3.24. Ephesians. 2.8.
, is given unto you; and that so clearly, as if you had never committed any
sin; 2 Cor. 5.21
then there is no doubt (by the grace of God) but the Lord will pardon all your
offenses; and If your sins were as red as scarlet, he will make them as
white as snow; Esaias 1.18.
and so you shall be made heirs of eternal life Ioh. 3.36. 1 Ioh. 5.13.
.

But there are too too many, which through their carelessness of repentance,
although Gods Preachers daily persuade them to repent; Esaias 1.18. Ier. 18.11. 2
King 17.13. Ier. 25.5. Ier. 7.3. Ezech. 33.11 Ier. 35.15. Hos. 14.3. Ier. 4.2.
Hos. 6.1. Joel 12.2.
do stand in doubt of their salvation; because they have grievously sinned,
and thereby greatly offended the Majesty of Almighty God, and procured his
curse for their sins, as the Scripture says, There is no peace to the wicked
Esaias 48.23, Prou. 38.1.
.

So that Satan lays before their faces all their sins they have committed,
whereby their conscience tells them, that by reason of their sins, which they
have so long continued in without repentance, that they stand now in great
danger of damnation, and that, Ibi nulla remis fio, vbi nulla posfit esse
poenitentia, There can be no pardon, where can be no repentance, according unto
Christ's own saying, Except ye repent, ye shall all be damned Luk 13.3. Esaias
59 2, Nahum. 1.2.
.

And note this for a certainty: so long as they carelessly stand, and continue
in their damnable estate of sin, without repentance, so long they may very
well doubt of their salvation; for he that continues in sin, and never
doubts of his salvation, scarce ever believes to be saved Ier. 20.14, 15.
Job. 3.3. Ier. 15.10. Job 10.18, 19. Jonah. 2.4 Psalm 42.11. Psalm. 31.11.
. Therefore let no man deceive himself, to continue in sin; for it will cost
him many a prayer, Col. 4.2. Luk 18 1. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17. Rom 12.12. 1 Timothy 2.8.
Ephesians. 6.18.
and cause him to let fall a multitude of tears for his sins, Iam. 4.9. Mat.
26.75. Deuteronomy. 1.45. 2 King 20.1, 2, 3. Genesis 37 34, 35. 2 King. 22.11, 19.
before he can be certain of his salvation: Yet let no man despair of the
mercies of God, because where is nulla petitio, gratia nulla, no prayer, no
grace, and no repentance, no pardon; but remember, the prayer of the righteous
avails much, if it be fervent Iam. 5.16.
, therefore speedily repent, for God is more merciful, than man can be
sinful, if man will be sorrowful.

If Satan say unto you, or any others; how know ye whether God will accept of
your repentance, or no, or if he would, how long may ye be assured of your
salvation?

You may answer him thus, (or in such like manner,) whereas I was truly
cleansed, Reu. 1 5. 1 Ioh. 1.7.
put on Christ, Gal. 3.27.
received inward grace, Tit. 3.7.
made the son of God, Luke 20.36. 1 Ioh. 3.1. Romans 8.14. Ioh. 1.12. Gal.
3.26. 2 Cor. 6.18.
and heir with Christ, Gal. 4.7. Romans 8.17. Tit. 3.7.
unto eternal life in my Baptism, although through the subtilty of thee, O
Satan, thou have tempted me to sin, and thereby have caused me to fall from
my former estate of righteousness: yet by the grace of God, so long as I have
truly repented, and am heartily sorry for all my ugly and loathsome sins,
which thou have entised me to commit, and am fully purposed, both now, and for
ever hereafter, to forsake thee O Satan, and all thy cursed company; and
withal, I am fully determined to continue in newness of life; so long my sure
trust and confidence is, That God will never forsake them that put their trust
in him: Romans 9.33. 1 Pet. 2.6. Acts 4.12.
and this faith is the faith of Gods elect, so many believed, as were ordained
unto salvation Acts 13 48.
.

And therefore he which has truly repented, and doubts of his salvation; his
unbelief bewrayes his ignorance in the word of God.

For, does not our Savior say, He that believes, and is baptized, shall be
saved Mark 16.16. Ioh 3.8. Ioh. 3.18
. Well then, I doubt not, but with a true heart, and clear conscience I may
say, I was baptized, I have truly repented, and am heartily sorry for all my
sins: and do truly purpose to continue by the grace of God in newness of
life, and do also fully believe: Ergo, I shall be saved; and as the best have
desired to make their election to salvation sure; so I, the unworthiest of all
other, do daily labor unto my God with all humility to do the same.

And therefore I say with Job, even with a good conscience and joyful heart,
that I am sure my Redeemer lives, and although worms destroy this body of
mine, yet in my flesh shall I see God Job 19.25 26
: And with Saint Paul, that When mine earthly house is destroyed, I have a
building given of God; (that is) an house not made with hands, but eternal in
Heaven 2 Cor 31.
, where is laid up for me a crown, of righteousness 2 Timothy 5
; so that I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, shall be
able to separate me from the love of God, Romans 8.38, 39.
which is in Christ Jesus my Savior, Acts 5.31. Luke 2.11. 2 Samuel 22.3. Psalm.
18.1.
in whom I trust, and in whom also I am sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of mine inheritance Ephesians. 1.13, 14. Ioh. 6.27. Revel. 7.3.
Ioh. 3.33.
.

And all those who are led by the Spirit of God, are the sons of God Gal.
4.5, 6, 7. Romans 8.17. 1 Ioh. 2.28.
; if sons, then children; if children, then heirs; even heirs annexed with
Christ unto eternal life, and consequently sure of salvation. And that so
sure, that no man can pluck them out of the hands of Christ Ioh. 10.28 2 Timothy
2.26. 1 Pet. 1.5. 1 Ioh. 5.14, 15
.

This assurance made the Virgin Marie call Christ her Savior, Luke 1.47.
the thief on the cross to say, Lord remember me Luke 23.42
, and Paul to say, that Christ gave himself for me Gal. 2.20.
, and in another place, I know on whom I have believed 2 Timothy 1.12.
.

This promise God has made unto all believers; He that believes in me,
though he were dead, yet he shall live Ioh. 11.25.
; for I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me
Ier. 32.40.
, they shall be my people, and I will be their God Ier. 32.38.
, and forgive their iniquities, and remember their sins no more Heb. 10.17
: And thus the greater your faith is, the greater is your assurance 1 Pet. 1.7,
8, 9.
.

Thus Gods word assures you, that if ye have truly repented, and continue in
newness of life, ye shall live, and not die: but save your soul alive Ezech.
18.21, 22.
to enjoy eternal life. Thus, if ye were never so weary and heavy laden, ye
shall be eased Mat. 11.28
; If your sins were as red as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow
Esaias 1.18.
: All this our gracious God has promised, which cannot lie; and has not only
sworn thereunto by an oath Heb. 6.17, 18. Esaias 54.9, 10
, but also bound himself by covenants, as it were a pair of Indentures, the
one in the Old Testament Ier. 1.33. Ier. 32 44. Ier. 24.7.
, the other in the New Heb. 10.16, 17.
.

And therefore ye may assure your selves by the testimonies of all these
Scriptures, that you may be as firmly persuaded of the certainty of your
salvation, as your hearts can witness the sincerity of your conversion. Saint
Paul proves it, I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me Gal. 2.20. 1 Cor.
3.16.
. So Christ and the Christian dwells not one with another, but one in
another; this being in Christ is a relative, for, We cannot be in him, but he
must be in us 1 Ioh 5 24
. Again, Know ye not your own selves (says he) how Jesus Christ is in you,
except ye be reprobates 2 Cor. 13.^
? Here Saint Paul gives them the title of reprobates, that know not how Jesus
Christ is in them.

By these words we ought all to understand, that all which believe have the
Spirit of discerning, to know certainly that they do believe; because the
faith which he here speaks of, is that lively faith, whereby Christ dwells
in our hearts; thus if Christ dwell in our hearts, then we are in Christ; if
we be in Christ, we cannot be condemned, for there is no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Jesus Romans 8.1.
.

And by these examples I conclude with this saying of Saint Peter, I would have
all that fear God, and hope to be saved, even for Gods sake, their own sake,
and their souls sake, to make their election sure, and they shall never fall 2
Pet. 1.10
; neither will that soul fear to go unto Christ, 1 Ioh. 3.10
that is in Christ, it knows it is reconciled unto his Savior Pal. 18.1.
Acts 5.31. 2 Samuel 12.3. Luke 2 11 1 Timothy 4.10. Matthew. 1.21.
, and therefore he need not to fear sudden death, who is ever prepared to
die: and also assured of his salvation, to live in Heaven with the royal
Priesthood Exodus 19.6 1 Pet. 2.9. Esaias. 61.6. Psalm. 132.9.
, the peculiar people, Tit. 2.14. Ioh. 10.28, 29, 30.
, the children of light 2 Samuel 22.29.
, the new creatures Gal. 6.15.
, the elect by Gods preordination Ephesians. 1.4. 1 Pet. 1.2.
, where all are Kings and heirs with Christ Romans 8.17. Gal 4 7. Tit. 3.7.
, invested with glory Romans 9.23.
, and crowned with Majesty 2 Timothy 4 8.
, to reign with Christ in his eternal Kingdom.

Lastly, if Satan lay open all your sins that ever you have committed, and say,
they are more and greater than can be pardoned, and so persuade you to
despair, then say unto him, Depart Satan, I defy thee, and all thy works if
my sins were as many as the hairs of mine head Psalm. 40.12
, or sands in the sea Manass. pr.
, yet it is God that justifies, who shall then condemn me Esaias 50.8. Romans
8.32, 33.
?

Oh Satan, I am none of thy cursed ^rew, nor by the grace of God never shall
^ee; thou have no part nor portion in me, wherefore I bequeath all, and every
one of my sins again unto thee, O Satan, from whence they came, and appeal
unto my God, in Christ, for his mercy, that he may save me from thy cursed
company.

Oh, thou hellish Fiend, I say again, Depart, I do utterly defy thee, O take
thy ugly sins again, which thou have caused me to commit; and lay them not
unto my charge, for I am a member of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 1 Cor.
6.15, 19.
, and partaker of his anointing 1 Ioh 2.27.
, and so long as I have earnestly repented of all those sins which thou have
enticed me to do, confessed my Saviors name Mat. 10.32. Romans 10 10, 2 Samuel
14.11.
, and presented my self a lively sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Almighty God
Romans 12.1. Reu 4.8, 10. 2 Pet. 5.9. Revel. 1.6. Romans 6.12.13.
, and also do in this life by the help of my Savior Act. 5.31. Luke 2.11.
Psalm. 18.1. Mat. 1.21. 2 Samuel 22 3. 1 Timothy 4.10.
, fight against thee thou damned Satan, and that with a clear and good
conscience Ephesians 6.11. Gal. 5.1, 17. 1 Timothy 1.18, 19.
, why then should I fear thee 1 Pet. 5.8.
? I am sure, that when I depart this life, I shall enjoy an everlasting
Kingdom with my Creator Mat. 25.34. 2 Timothy 3.12.
.

But mark this one thing aright, without favor or affection unto any
particular sin; that ye be well assured that ye have repented and are
heartily sorry for all your sins; as those alleged Scriptures do teach you
Ezech. 18.21, 22, 23. 2 King 17.13 Acts 2.38. 2 Pet. 3.8. Acts 17.30. Hos.
14.2. Ier. 36.3. Luke 13.3. Ier. 18.11. Mat. 4.17. Mat. 3.26.
, for otherwise (if you have but the least of your sins left to reign in
you) he will soon find matter enough to plead against you. Wherefore you must
not only barely repent, and slightly sorrow for your sins, and so carelessly
give them over, as though you could repent when you would; but ye must accuse
your sins, loath, hate, and detest them, your conscience must witness
against them, and your hearts convince them.

Oh, beloved, is it a greater terror unto you, to accuse your sins, than it
was a delight to commit them? would ye be in love with sin, which is the
souls sickness, and the breach of Gods Law, which whosoever commits is of
the Devil: how dare ye act those sins, you dare not ask for pardon? Have
you procured Gods vengeance, and will ye refuse to ask for his mercy? Oh,
no, no; the more penitent a sinner is, the more merciful is God, and the
readier to give pardon.

So that all ye which have truly repented, and fully purpose to continue in
newness of life, may boldly say unto Satan, or unto any of his despairing
Iudasses, that would persuade you to despair: That the God whom I serve is
able to deliver me Dan. 6.16.
, so that the gates of hell shall not prevail against me Mat. 16.18.
, for he makes me to dwell in safety Psalm. 4.9.
; yea, and that both in soul and body, whether I live or die Romans 14.8.
, I am not mine own 1 Cor. 6.19
, but belong wholly unto my Savior Jesus Christ 1 Cor. 3.23 Tit. 2.14.
, who by his precious blood has satisfied for all my sins 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.
Ephesians. 1.7. Heb. 9.14. Revel. 1.5. Heb. 2.14.
, delivered me from the power of the Devil Esaias 53.34
, to preserve me Ioh. 6.39. Ioh. 10.28. 1 Pet. 1.5. 2 Thessalonians. 3.3.
from all danger, that without the will of my heavenly Father, not so much as
one hair of my head shall fall from me Mat. 10.30 Luke 21.18. 2 Samuel 14.11
Acts 27.34.
. Therefore I will not doubt of my salvation, nor fear what man or Satan can
do against me; for I will put my whole trust in the mercy of God, If he slay
me, yet will I put my trust in him Job 13.15.
.

And thus with a true affection and desire of heart Ioh. 4.23, 24. Psalm. 145.18
through the inward feeling of our miseries 2 Chronicles. 20.21. Psalm. 2.11. Esaias
66.2.
, you must cast your selves down prostrate in the presence of Almighty God
Romans 10.14
, and build your selves on this sure foundation Iam. 1.6.
, that ye, though far unworthy, yet for Jesus Christ his sake, are
certainly heard of God Ioh. 14.13.
, even as he has promised in his word Mat. 7.7, 8. Mat. 11.24. Luke 11.9. Ioh.
16.24.
.

And withal, you must be so fervent with God in your daily prayers, for the
forgiveness of your sins, that ye must with Jacob, even wrestle with God
Genesis 32.26.
, and never let the Lord go, until he bless you: but with sighs, groans and
tears Iam. 4.9. Deuteronomy. 14.5.
, bewail your sins, beg for his mercies, and that so entirely, as it were
for life and death; yea weep for your sins like Mary Magdalen Ioh. 20.15.
, and power forth floods of tears like Ezechia 2 King 20.3
: until ye do so, you shall never have peace, nor quietness of conscience,
neither any sound comfort of Gods holy Spirit in you.

Thus all those which have truly repented, and continued in newness of life,
are spiritually renati et iustificati, borne again in righteousness, and
justified from sin; wherefore I conclude with this belief, that I do fully
hope (through the merits of Jesus Christ) to be saved, and am resolved that
eternal life belongs not unto others only, but unto me also: so that Christ
died for my sins, and rose again for my justification; and that God who gave
him for me, gave me all things with him, Romans 8.32. If all things, then he gave
me eternal life.

This is my faith, and from this faith permanet in facto men's mea firma suo,
fears shall not compel me; and lachrymae voluuntur inanes, and tears shall
not move me to change my mind: Quia men's immota manet; for I am fully
resolved, never to alter it, and I do rest in hope, and am always waiting for
the accomplishment thereof.

Now whereas I have laid open the certainty of man's salvation; as far, and as
fair as I can, by the authority of Gods word, I purpose in this second
Chapter, by the help of God, to set forth the doctrine of repentance, and show
the necessity thereof: and so conclude according unto this Text of Scripture,
Matthew. 3.2. Repent ye.
GOod Christian Readers, if ye look through the whole book of God, from the
Alpha of Genesis, unto the Omega of the Revelation; you shall find scarce any
Text to be shorter than this; yet howsoever there is none more needful, nor
any more profitable; neither does the Holy Ghost so much labor in all the
Scripture, as he does to draw men unto repentance, Repent ye Ezech. 18.21.
Eccles. 8.21 22. Ier. 18.11. Acts 17.30. 2 King 17.13. Ier. 25.5. Acts 11.18.
Luk 3 3. Ier 36.3. Mat. 3.2, 8. 2 Pet. 3.9. Mat. 4.14.17. Act. 2.38. Hos. 14.1,
2. Esaias 31 6. Mal. 3.7. Ezech. 33.11 Ierem. 4.14. Esaias 1.16. Esaias 55.7. Luke 13
3. 2 Chro. 33.6
.

Great need requires great haste, and the wound that is deepest, has need of
the diligentest cure, so that the longer I have continued in sin, the more
earnestly I do return unto my God by repentance; for repentance ought to
bring forth as much sorrow, as sin gave delight; example in Manasses Manass.
pr.
, Mary Magdalen Luke 7.18.
, and the like.

Saint Augustine was a great sinner, and wrote many books of repentance: which
shows to whom much is forgiven, they ought to love much: and the greater
their sins are, the more need they have of repentance, Repent ye.

And I which am the unworthiest of all men, have wrote, (for the benefit of
others, as well as my self) almost all the books that ever I made, concerning
repentance: and the longer I have written of it, the more tender my heart is,
and the more earnest my desire is to return unto my God by repentance, and
amendment of life, in the which I pray God to gire me his grace to continue
unto my lives end.

And as a Traitor that is condemned to die, (if he loved his Prince,) he would
go near to break his heart with grief, to think that he should be so
villainous unto so gracious a Prince that would forgive al^ his fact, if he
would but ask for pardon, become a new man, and true subject unto him:

Even so it is with me, (through grief for my sins,) each time I behold Gods
mercies toward me, (a miserable and most wretched sinner,) in sparing me so
long, and giving me such a large time of repentance. Repent ye. Duo verba, duo
luminaria, These two words are like the two great lights in Heaven Genesis 1.16.
, which serve to direct us in all our ways, they are the Supersedeas and
discharge of sin Iam. 3.5. Mat. 12.41 Luke 11.32. Esaias 1.16. Genesis 50 17. 2 Pet.
3.9. Ezech. 18.20, 21. Mal. 13.7. Esaias 55.7. Zach. 1.3. Ezech 33.5. Esaias 56.2.
Ier. 4.14.
through the merits of Jesus Christ 1 Pet 1 18, 19. Heb 9.14. Revel. 1.5.
: And the cause of unity between God and man. They are Imperatoria breuitas, a
Lordlike breuity: It Is short, for fear lest man's brittle memory should come
short of it: and it is the full weight of a few words, Virtus maxima in mole
minima, very much in a little. And they are more precious than any pearl, or
pure gold, and as needful to direct me that made this book, as you that read
it: wherefore if ever we hope to be saved, we must needs forsake our sins,
and with all humility return unto God by repentance, according unto my Text,
Repent ye.

For as God is merciful unto the penitent sinner Exodus 34.5 6, 7. Psalm. 145 9.
Exodus 20 6.
, he also shows his justice unto the reprobate Deuteronomy 32.4. Psalm. 55.6. Exodus

Again, Inanis poenitentia, quam sequens culpa de nouo iterat: Vain is that
repentance which an after fall defiles: It avails a man nothing, to ask of
God for pardon of his sins, and fall like an hog into the mire of his
sinful life afresh again.

Wherefore if ye will truly repent, ye must forsake all your sins for ever,
and return unto God by repentance, as these Scriptures teach you. O ye
children of Israel (says Esaias) turn again from your evil ways, wherein you
have drowned your selves Esaias 31 6.
, turn you, turn you from all your evil ways, for why will ye die, O ye
house of Israel Ezech. 33.11
? Return unto me, and I will return unto you, says the Lord Mal 3.7.
. Again, O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness that thou may be
saved Ier. 4.14.
. And again, Let the wicked forsake their evil ways, and return unto the
Lord, and he will have mercy on them, for he is merciful, and very ready to
forgive Esaias 55.7.
: So that, Nemo ad Deum flens accessit, qui non quod postulauit, accepit; No
man came ever weeping unto God, who did not receive that which he required,
(especially if he sought it through faith in his repentance:) wherefore Saint
Peter wept bitterly, that his tears might wash away his sins Mat. 26 75.
.

Oh, let us daily labor with all humility, to wash away the pollution of our
sins with tears in our repentance, that we may be saved.

Now good Christian Readers, I would have you to consider, that I made not this
book only for mine own private use, with an Attend mihi, a suit unto God
for my self, (which of all men have most need of repentance,) but also like
the poor Italian beggar, with an Attend tihi: Now for Gods sake, your own
sake, and your souls sake, be mrecifull, be charitable, and comfortable unto
your own souls, and Repent ye.

So that you with me, and I with you, may all from the bottom of our hearts,
return unto the Lord by true repentance: And as Tertullian says, Sperando
timebimus, timendo cauebimus, cauendo salui erimus: In hoping or desiring to
repent, we shall fear our sins, in fearing take heed to amend our lives, and
in taking heed, (through our true repentance) by the merits of our Savior
Psalm. 18.1. 2 Samuel 22.3 Acts 5.31. Luke 2.11. Mat. 1.21. 1 Timothy 4 1^.
Jesus Christ, be saved.

For, God assures no man pardon for his sins Luke 13.3. Nahum. 1.2. Esaias 59
2. 1 Ioh. 1.9. 1 Ioh. 3.8.
, but such as return unto him by true repentance, become new creatures 1 Pet.
1.23 Gal. 6 15. 2 Cor 5.17. Rom 11.5.
, and walk in newness of life Romans 6.4. 1 Pet. 2 9, 10, 11, 12. Acts 3 16.
Ephesians. 4 1. Gal 5 10. 1 Ioh. 2 3, 5, 6.
.

Wherefore beloved, seeing that mine, and all our souls are infected with the
poison of sin, let us not look, or think on our worldly business; nor let
our souls gad abroad with Dinah, but commune with our own hearts, and return
unto God by speedy repentance; for Periculum est animae, our souls lie at the
stake, or point of death, bleeding with the heavy burden of our sins, and
can be no way cured or saved, but by repentance, whom none can pardon but God

Therefore let us repent while me may have time, and defer it not until
hereafter; for, Qui non est hodie, cras minus aptus erit; He that is not ready
to repent to day, will be less ready to morrow; because his heart will be more
hardened, his conscience more seared, his soul more stung with sin, and
himself more weak to get out of the claws of the Devil.

Luk 2.11. 2 Samuel 22.3. Mat. 11.21. 1 Timothy 4.^.
Jesus Christ, will be the water to quench them. Repent ye.

If ever precept came home unto our hearts, to warn us to forsake our sins,
it is this: if ever charge was reasonable, or most needful for our souls
salvation, it is this, Repent ye.

God has given us, membra duplicia, two members, two eyes, two ears, two
arms, two legs: that the failing of the one, may be supplied by the other;
animam vero vnam, he has given us but one soul; when that is lost there is no
supply.

I see (gentle Readers) the more I enter into repentance, the more tender mine
heart is, and the more my unrepented sins do grieve me, so that the grief
of mine heart is so great, for my sins, that I can go no further to instruct
you in the doctrine of repentance, before I have eased mine own heart, by
bewailing my sins unto Almighty God: and like the poor Lazarus, or wounded
beggar, lay oven all my wounds, blaines, and putrefying sores of sin, unto my
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Now I know no way better to grieve and lament for my sins, than with Aannah
