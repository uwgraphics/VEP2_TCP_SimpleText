ROBIN HOOD's Rescuing WILL. STVTLY, From the Sheriff and his Men, who had
taken him Prisoner, and were going for to Hang him, etc.
To the Tune of, Robin Hood and Queen Catherine, etc.
Licensed and Entered according to Order.



WHen Robin Hood in the green wood stood,
derry, derry, down,
Under the green wood tree,
Tidings there came to him with speed,
Tidings for certainty,
hey down, derry, derry, down:
That Will. Stutly surprised was,
And eke in prison lay,
Three Varlets that the King had hired,
Did likely him betray:
Ay, and to morrow hanged must be,
To morrow as soon as it is day;
But before they could this victory g^t,
Two of them did Stutly slay.
When Robin Hood he heard this news,
Lord he was grieved sore,
Ay and to his merry Men he said,
Who altogether swore,
That Will. Stutly should rescued be,
And be brought back again,
Or else should many a gallant Wight,
For his sake there be slain.
He clothed himself in scarlet then,
His Men were all in green,
A fairer show throughout the World,
In no place could be seen.
Good Lord, it was a gallant sight,
To see them all on a row,
With every Man a good broad sword,
And eke a good yew-bow,
Forth of the green wood they are gone,
Yea, all courageously,
Resolving to bring Stutly home,
Or every Man to d^e:
And when they came the Castle ne^^,
Whereas Will. Stutly lay
I hold it good, said Robin Hood,
We here in ambush slay;
And send one forth some news to hear,
To yonder Palmer fa^e,
That stands under the Castle wall,
Some news he may declare.
With that steps forth a brave young Man,
Which was of courage bold,
Thus he did say to the old Man,
I pray thee, Palmer old,
Tell me if that thou rightly ^en,
derry, derry, down.
When must Will. Stutly dye;
Who is one of Bold Robin's Men,
And here does Prisoner lie;
hey down, derry, derry, down.
Alas, alas, the Palmer said,
derry, derry, down,
And for ever woe is me,
Will. Stutly hanged will be to day,
On yonder is gallow-tree;
hey down, derry, derry, down.
O had his Noble Master known,
He would some Succor send,
A few of his bold Ycomandre
Full soon would fetch him hence.
Ay, that is true, the young Man said,
Ay, that is true, said he;
Or if they were near to this place,
They soon would set him free.
But fare thou well, thou good old Man;
Farewell, and thanks to thee;
If Stutly hanged be this day,
Revenged his death will be.
He was no sooner from the Palmer gone,
But the gates was opened wide,
And out of the Castle Will. Stutly came,
Guarded on every side.
When he was forth of the Castle come,
And saw no help was nigh,
Thus he did say unto the Sheriff,
Thus he said gallantly,
Now seeing that I needs must dye,
Grant me one boon, said he,
For my Noble Master never had Man,
That yet was hanged on tree:
Give me a sword all in my hand,
And let me be unbound,
And with thee and thy Men i will fight,
Until I lie dead on the ground.
But this desire he would not grant,
His wishes were in vain,
For the Sheriff had sworn he hanged should be,
And not by the sword be slain.
Do but unbind my hands, he says,
I will no weapons crave,
And if I hanged be this day,
Damnation let me have.
O no, no, the Sheriff, he said,
Thou shall on the gallows dye;
Ay, and so shall thy Master too,
If ever in me it lie.
O dastard Coward, Stutly cries,
Thou faint-hearted Peasant-slave,
If ever my Master do thee meet,
Thou shall thy payment have.
My Noble Master thee does scorn,
And all thy cowardly Crew,
Such silly Imps unable are
Bold Robin to subdue.
But when he was to the gallows come,
And ready to bid adieu,
Out of a bush stepts Little John,
And steps Will. Stutly too,
I pray thee Will, before thou dye,
Of thy dear Friends take leave:
I needs must borrow him a while,
How say you, Master Sheriff?
Now as I live, the Sheriff said,
That Varlet will I know,
Some sturdy Rebel is that same,
Therefore let him not go.
With that Little John so hastily
Away cut Stutly's hands,
And from one of the Sheriff's Men
A sword twicht from his hands,
Here Will, take thou this same,
Thou can it better sway,
And here defend thyself a while,
For Aid will come straightway.
And there they turned them back to back;
In the middle of them that day,
Till Robin Hood approached near
With many an Archer gay.
With that an arrow by them flew,
I wilt from Robin Hood:
Make haste, make haste, the Sheriff he said,
Make haste, for it is good.
The Sheriff is gone, his doubtless Men
Thought it no boot to stay,
But as their Master had them taught,
They run full fast away.
O stay, O stay, Will. Stutly said,
Take leave e're you depart;
You never will catch Bold Robin Hood,
Unless you dare him meet.
O ill betide you, said Robin Hood,
That you so soon are gone,
My sword may in the scabbard rest,
For here our work is done.
I little thought, Will. Stutly said,
When I came here to this place,
For to have met with Little John,
Or seen my Master's face.
Thus Stutly was at liberty set,
And safe brought from his Foe:
O thanks, O thanks to my Master,
Since here it was not so.
And once again, my Fellows dear,
derry, derry, down.
We shall in the green woods meet,
Where we will make our bow-strings twang,
Music for us most sweet;
hey down, derry, derry, down.
