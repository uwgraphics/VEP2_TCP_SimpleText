The Northern Ladd: OR, The Fair Maids Choice.
Who Refused all for a Plowman, counting her self therein most Happy.
A Country Lass who many suitors had,
Some good, some mean, the worst of them not bad;
A Weaver, Tailor, Shoo-maker, first came,
With many more of ample note and fame:
A Barber, Baker, Miller, and the like,
Yet unto none of those her Sails she would strike:
But in a Rustick-she is only pleased,
A Plowman only has her fancy eased.
To the Tune of, There was a Lass in Cumberland, etc.




I Am a Lass o'th North Country,
and I was born and bred a whom;
Many a Lad has Courted me,
and swore that they to woo me come:
But to bed to me, to bed to me,
the Lad that gangs to bed with me;
A jovial Plowman must he be,
the Lad that comes to bed to me.
The first that came with Breeches trim,
a Weaver was most neatly dressed,
But I alas would none of him,
whilst Weavers on Sheep-heads do feast.
But to bed to me, etc.
For Heads and Horns are wemish meat,
to serve a Lass of my degree;
Who Beef and Bacon always eat,
therefore he is no meat for me:
But to bed to me, etc.
The next a Tailor was so fine,
with Slash, and Slits, and Cap-a-pee,
Who scraped, and cring'd, and said he is mine,
and that he fain would ligg with me:
But to bed to me, to bed to me,
the Lad that comes to bed to me,
A lusty Plowman may he be,
the Lad that bumps the bed with me.


HE whispering told me he would mend,
a slit I had to my content,
But saucy Prick-louse did offend,
so to be stitched I'se not consent:
For to bed to me, to bed to me,
the Lad that gangs to bed to me,
A bonny Plowman must he be,
the Lad that shakes the Sheets with me.
A Shoo-marker came jumping in,
who plainly did his suit declare,
And did my foot to squeeze begin,
and on them pressed of Shoon a pair:
But to bed to me, etc.
He tickled me about the Knee,
and told me it was his request,
To live, to love, and wa'd with me,
and I'se should be of wealth possessed:
But to bed to me, etc.
But these fine toys did not prevail,
though spruce and fine with powdered Locks
Nay, though he Twopence spent in Ale,
he could no catch me in his stocks;
For to bed to me, etc.
A Barber-Surgeon came to me,
whom I did take in great disdain,
He said his art I soon should see,
for he would prick my master-Vein:
But to bed to me, etc.
But I repelled his rude address,
and told him 'twas my greatest cares,
If wa'd a lousy A-Snip, alas,
when he is incensed should keep my ea^
But to bed to me, to bed to me,
the man that comes bed to me,
An honest Plowman must he be,
the Lad that is embraced by me.
A Baker next-who called me Cozen,
did beg for one salute of me,
Presenting straight French Roals a dozen,
but's Neck was warped with Pillory:
Oh! to bed to me, etc.
And then a Miller who for cogging,
for thieving and such like with his Bowl
Upon his Horse came softly jogging,
who lighting straight demanded Tole.
But to bed to me, etc.
He told me I was his by right,
whereat I smiled disdainfully;
Your Stones said I are ruined quite,
therefore expect no more of me.
But to bed to me, etc.
A Plowman is the jovial Lad,
who still despises grief and care,
With him content and pleasure's had,
with him a Rustic life I Will share:
It Is he shall came to bed to me, etc.
I'se grasp him in my arms all night,
and when the shades shall disappear,
In pleasing Groves we will take delight,
and with sweet Songs each other cheer
Oh to bed to me, etc.
Come my dear when Nelly calls,
O let us in this shady Grove,
Now venture on what e're befalls,
and quench the passion of my Love:
Oh! to bed to me, to bed to me,
when thou art come to bed to me,
How happy then will Nelly be,
when thou art come to bed to she.
FINIs.
