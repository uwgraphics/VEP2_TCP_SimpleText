THE Undaunted SEAMAN; Who resolved to Fight for his King and Country: TOGETHER
WITH His Love's Sorrowful Lamentation at their Departure.
To the Tune of, I often for my Jenny strove.
Licenced according to Order.





MY Love I come to take my leave,
Yet prithee do not sigh and grieve;
On the wide Ocean I will sight,
For to maintain the Nation's Right:
Under Noble Chief Commanders,
I resolve to take my Chance;
On Board I Will enter, Life I Will venture,
To subdue the Pride of France.
My Dear, said she, be not unkind,
I shall no Peace nor Comfort find,
My very Heart will break for thee,
If thus we must divided be:
While thou art with Foes surrounded,
Where the loud-mouthed Cannons roar;
This Warlike Action breeds Distraction,
I shall never see thee more.
Let no such fear attend my Dear,
I hope to be as safe as here;
For King and Country's good I Will stand,
And vow to fight with Heart and Hand:
None but Cowards fear to venture,
Freely will I take my chance;
On Board I Will enter, Life I Will venture,
To subdue the Pride of France.






The Youthful Damsel then did cry,
I Will part with Gold and Silver too,
Another person to Employ,
that may be better spared than you:
Never shall I be contented,
While you leave your Native Shore;
This warlike Action breeds Distraction;
I shall never see thee more.
My Dear all Hazards will I run,
My thinks the Work cannot be done,
Except I do in Person go,
To Face that Perjured Potent Foe:
We have Warlike Sons of Thunder,
Which will Valiantly Advance
To the wide Ocean, for Promotion,
And to check the Pride of France.
My Dear, the Royal English Fleet,
With the Dutch Navy, will complete
The Work, which fairly is begun,
We fear not but Monsieur will run;
For we'll drive the Rogues before us,
Teach them such an English Dance,
While they retire, still we'll fire,
Check the growing Pride of France.
With Sighs and Tears this Damsel said,
If you resolve to go to Sea,
In Sailers Robes I Will be arrayed,
and freely go along with thee:
Life and Fortune I will Venture,
Rather than to stay on Shore;
Grief will oppress me, and possess me,
That I never shall see thee more.
Said he, My Dearest stay on Land,
such idle Fancies never pursue,
Thy soft and tender milk-white Hand,
Seamen's labor cannot do:
Here I leave both Gold and Treasure,
To maintain my Dear on Shore;
But still She crying and replying,
I shall never see thee more.
Thy Gold's no more than Dross to me,
alas! my Heart is sunk full low,
The want of thy sweet Company,
will surely prove my Overthrow:
Therefore dearest do not leave me
Here tormented, on the Shore;
Let us not sever, love for ever,
Lest I never shall see thee more.
Though bitterly she did Complain,
Her Sighs and Tears were all in vain,
He would not suffer her to go,
So many Cares and Griefs to know:
But with sweet Salutes they parted,
She was left with Tears on Shore;
Here often crying and replying,
I shall never see him more.
