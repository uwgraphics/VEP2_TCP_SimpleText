COme listen a while and a Story you will hear,
That will strike you with dead and amazement and fear
It Is of a vile Butcher which with bloody Knife,
Without all compassion did murder his wife,
In Leaden Hall Market, who came to reclaim,
Him from (...) Debauchrys and life of ill fame:
Then let all be warned how they rashly proceed,
Least trouble and anguish for them be decreed.
He had been long absent which made her suspect,
Both her and his business he did much neglect,
Which put her in passion, that straight way she went,
To know by this usuage what to her he meant,
In Leaden Hall Market she found him, and there
The cause of her grief she did freely declare:
Then let all be warned how they rashly proceed,
Lest trouble and anguish for them be decreed.
Though justly reproved, yet so Angry he grew,
That at her with violence his Knife he then threw;
But that little Harming, I Tremble to tell ye,
He took it and Struck it full Deep in her Belly,
At which she Shrick'd and Cried out, Oh! I Am Dead:
But he sought not to Fly, o're-come with the Dread:
Then let all be warned how they rashly proceed,
Least trouble and anguish for them be decreed.
Being seized for this Crime he is Committed to Goal,
As for Murder we know ^dmits of no Bail;
And coming to Trial, Not Guilty did plead,
But plain^ 'twas proved that he did the sad deed,
(...) could not deny that he gave her the Wound,
And therefore of Murder he Guilty was found:
Then let all be warned how they rashly proceed,
Least trouble and anguish for them be decreed.
This startled him sore, for though unconcerned he,
Could kill his dear wife, yet now death he did see,
Was so near approaching him as his sad doom,
He trembled for fear of the judgment to come:
To Newgate he then was in Irons conveyed,
Where piteous sighs and laments he then made:
Then let all be warned how they rashly proceed,
least trouble and anguish for them be decreed.
He fancys her blood loud for vengeance does cry,
Whom he caused on so slight an occasion to dye;
Or that all pale her sad Ghost does appear,
Which fills him with horror, amazement, and fear,
Laments and sad Groans now him company keep,
And Dreams affrighting disorder his sleep,
Then let all be warned, etc.
Blood guiltiness heavy now on him does lie,
And makes him to sigh, and to sob, and to cry,
O that his dear wife he had never thus used,
Whom often, it is plain, he before had abused,
Because she would tell of his wicked life,
And give him good Counsel like a loving wife:
Then let all be warned, etc.
His Drunken Debauchries now swarm in his mind,
And how he to her and himself was unkind,
By spending his money so idley on those,
That Lewdly had brought him to trouble and woes,
And though for Repentance it is not too late,
Yet death now looks terrible on life's short date,
Then let all be warned, etc.
And Conscience cries loudly still urging the guilt,
Of the Innocent blood that he causelessy spilt,
He owns his Rash folly and grieves for to find,
Himself could be cruel to her that was kind,
But no sparring mercy in reason can crave
Who with bloody Knife sent his Wife to her Grave,
Then let all be warned, etc.
Thus let all Rash men well consider his fall,
Now innocence loudly for Vengeance does call,
And govern their passions that bring them to shame,
For which when too late they themselves do much blan^
Consider how Rashness brings troubles ^d fears,
Shame, Ruin, and death, it often for them prepares,
Then let all be warned how they rashly proceed,
Least trouble and anguish for them be decreed.
