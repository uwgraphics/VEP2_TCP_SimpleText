THE DECLARATION THE LORD GENERAL OF THE ARMY OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLICS IN
THE PROVINCE OFTEN LEINSTER.
WHereas upon the late Design on Dublin I was transported with a particular
desire of advancing his Majesty's service, and preserving those Parts from the
destruction that commonly waits on the chance of war, to entertain ^reaty
with the Lord Marquess of Clanrickard not doubting to obtain by his Lord^^^^s
means, such conditions for the Confederat Catholics, as might render the
^^ngdome satisfied, And after some time spent in the consideration of the con^s
of that engagement, I acquainted the Council and Congregation therewith, (...)
on a more strict Examination thereof, having taken to consideration the law in
^e against Catholic Religion in this Kingdom found the contents of that
enga^^ment in many essential points to be short of the liberty and freedom
requisite in (...) free exercise of the Catholic Religion, and the safety of
the lives and fortunes of Confederat Catholics, as by the Council and
Congregations observations on that engagement may more evidently appear, upon
advertisement whereof I held my self ^^^^ged by the oath of union which I had
sworn, and by the faith I ought to the Na^^^^ to recede from the treaty, if
the objections against that Engagement were not satis^^^^ by enlargement of
further Grants that might satisfy the Council and Congrega^^^^. And moreover
to take from me all hopes of any Conclusion that way, I found (...) contrary to
the said engagement a resolution was taken not to receive any of the ^^^y under
my command to Garizon in Dublin and other principal Garizons under (...)
majesty's obedience that being the chief point granted me for the security of
the ^^^d engagement, so as I mainely mistrusted there was no good intention
toward the ^^nfederat Catholics either in the matters granted or in the
security thereof, seeing ^^en in the uery first entrance an apparent breach of
the promise contained in that ^^gagement, so as it stood neither with honor nor
security I should rely on that enga^^ment. Being therefore compelled to desist
from further proceeding therein, ac^^rdingly withdrew the forces under my
command to the Quarters designed for them (...) order of the Council and
Congregation. yet least any should be misled by an opinion of the continuance
of that Treaty or any conclusion thereupon, I thought good ^ot finding any
thing in the whole conduct of that affair whereby the innocence of ^^y actions
may not be generally acknowledged) to publish this declaration, that all the
^onfederat Catholics may be thereby forewarned to stand on their own defense
against the adverse Party, and not to insist or rely on any Conditions but,
such as by authority of the Council and Congregation, or of the General
Assembly shall be set^led, that being the whole scope of my intention in the
late treaty, notwithstanding any misconstruction to the Contrary, which I
desire may bey so understood, whereby the perfect union of the Confederate
Catholics may have full settlement, and my in^^ntion heareby declared not to
adhere to any other resolution or Union.
