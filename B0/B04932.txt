MORISTONUS MARTYR* TO THE Glorious Memory of the much Renowned Gentleman,
ANDREW KER of MORISTOVN, Who was Slain at Buda, July 19. 1686.

A Funeral Elegy.

Moristonus obit quanquam victoria parta est,
Vix Mahumet tanti, totaque Buda fuit.
Omnis Christianus Christo militat, cui quicunque in hoc bello sanguine litat,
Martyr est. Tertull. By NINIAN PATERSON.

Printed in the Year 1687.

To the much Honored the Land of More^^^^.
SIR,
I^ (...) Holy War against those ^arbarous and Blasphemous Infidels, your (now
both in Heaven and Earth) most glorious Brother, has had the honor to
Sacrifice his Life; There was indeed, n^ fairer way, to engrave the Glory of
your Fame, and Family in the Immortal Annals of all ensuing Ages. I doubt not
but his Death wi^^ shortly be the sad Joyfull-theam of a more skillful, and
accomplished Pen* The cruel and fretting afflictions I have unfortunatly
encountered, (which I hope shall prove all but ^ed-^ea to my Cana^^, to which
Age now have me) have so li^^ (...) a^ my senses, that am like one gone along
journey from himself, where the excess of Sorro^ fearce gives way to the relief
of Words; The evident tokens whereof, a that formerly knew me, will quickly
perceive, in the following Poem Being, alas! wholly destitute of the delicaces
of an acut Invention, and the politness of a transporting expression; but what
is sometimes a man's Fa^ is not always his Fault, as by a dear bought
Experience, I have too mu^^ learned now to know. I am not altogether of his
mind that lately w^ the Life of the Grand Vizier Cara Mustapha, that it was
only an amo^ous pique that has rumbled the World, into these Grand
Transactions to me they carry the ting and tincture of an higher Source; And
thou that now all Caresses and Liberalities to the ^uses be banished this part
of (...) World, yet could I have the happiness to animat any to that degree of
Z^ to avenge the Injury and Quarrel of our blasphemed Savior, I doubt (...)
but my now naked Muse would quickly grow Pen-feathered, and learn to s^ with
such a touring Wing, as would render them the celebrated Models Religion,
Virtue, and Honor. I have fo born, in this Address to h^ expatiated on your
own Person (...) and Gallantry, lest it should s^ an attack upon your modesty:
(...) Winter-day, I shall make ame^^ for my unpleasantness by my b^ (...) ^^en
I have only told you so g^ an esteem I have for your (...) ^^at unto what
extremity of adv^ Fortun, I am so ever reduce^ (...) always preserve the
profound ^spect and Passion of

SIR, Your most Devouted and Humble Servant NINIAN PATERSO^

To the Reader.
THe disastrous Discords that have miserably infested, and almost harassed
Great Britain, and many other parts of Europe this long time by past, have
diverted our Illustrious Princes, and Magnanimous Hero's from the least thought
of this Holy War, till our blessed GOD in his just Judgment, stirred up the
insolent Spirit of that fierce bloody and barbarous Robber, the great Turk, to
blaspheme our Savior, and threaten all Christendom with Ruin and Destruction;
The Titles he that appropriat to himself, and his very Name will justify these
Characters, for the Word Mahumet is derived from the Hebrew Machach quod
percutere, ferire, caedere, vel delere, and delendo perdere* significat; so the
Devils name and his, Appolyon and Mahuamet are Synonims; his other Title
Sultan, (though properly Arabic) derived off the Hebrew Shall^t and Sh^l^^^n,
which signifies Dominion and Power. That same word which we find Genesis 42.
and 6th. translated the G^vernour, a Title wherein the chief Rulers of Egypt
and Babylon did much glory, and stolen from them by this Thief. These his
opprobrious insolences did awaken the religious Courage, and inflame the
sacred Z^al, of not only the crowned Heads and Scepter-swaying Hands of
Imperial- Majesty, these earthly Dieties; but also the Heroic Hearts of some
of minor Rank, though not directly interessed in this War, from Spain, Italy
France and England, and some also of the Low Countries, to contribute their Aid
to this Villans Destruction* for the honor of their Savior, whom thi^ Monster
had impiously and excerably blasphemed; and to signalize their Honor and
Courage in so glorious an interprize against the Excrements of Mankind, and the
Spa^^ of Hell. And now by the permission of GOD, the Scourge of Christendom,
whom we cannot by the way omit to tell you, how Octavianus M^ni^us describes.

Perfidus hic praedo, cul nec fas, nec pudor ^llus,
Nec pietatis honos, nec d^lois pignora pacis:
Sed tantum imperii, and caedis scelerata cupido.
Amongst whom this brave young Gentleman, the Lord of Moristoun made no small
figure, being of a very honorable Birth, and descended of the most ancient
Familsies of the Mers and ^^viotdale, and of an Estate, though in the West, yet
not much estranged from the Bowels of the East: While we speak of him, it must
be observed, that the Reader will find him, though honorably, yet with a great
mistake of both Name and Title mentioned page 30 in the Historical Description
of the Seige of Buda, it being written by a Frenchman, though an exact
Recorder, and Eyewitness of all these bloody Transactions, yet utterly
unacquaint with our Moristoun, with him went along from Scotland (known to be
the Mother of Magnanimity, her Children in most parts of Christendom, being
known by the Title of valiant and adventerous Scots) persons of good Birth and
Quality, whose names and honor without wrong done to Posterity must not be
omitted.

Duke of Berwick, Lord George Savill Son to the Marquess of Hallifax, the Lord
Mountjoy, Colonel Barrage* Mr. Smith Esquire, Mr. Couts Esquire, Captain
Rupert, Mr. Wiseman Esquire, and the Lord of Dalmany our Countryman, who on
this same account ought never to be mentioned without Honor.

I hope none will be so peevish to be offended because I call the Turk
Antichrist, it is done by many hundreds before me, and these Divines of no mean
esteem, Montague (...) App^llo C^sarem has made it evident as with a Sunbeam;
and Zanchius too in many of his Writings, Tom. 7. ^e perseverant sanctorum; and
also in Tractatu de (...) saeculi; and To^ ^ respon. ad Ar^ia^u^, by such
Arguments as these, that he exalts himself against all that is called GOD, and
most blasphemously denies GOD, neither acknowledging the Trinity, not yet that
Holy One, the Power of GOD, denis also that Christ is God, and affirms that he
shall only be a Witness of the Judgment, and not a Judge of the World, as we
read in Alcoran^ Az^^^, ^. Quod Jesus Christus circa temp^^ judicij sit
moriturus and sicut alij homines resurrecturus. Az^^^, 49. Christum non judicem
sed testem judicij ^acit, Damas^^^s in libro de Heresibus in h^resi
Is^aelitarum sive Aga^^n^^um. P. ^86. And for ^his Paradise, it is nothing but
a luxurious Banquet, in a brutish Baudi-house. It Is he that reigns in the
Seven-hilled City of Constantinople, and sits in the very Temple of God, for
Jerusalem is his, ^^^h name Mahumetis, (as M^ntagu^ manifests) makes up the
number of the Beast, as also a great part of the World runs after him, ecce
homo, this is he; And would to God, the Cries and Complaints, the Chains, and
Bonds, the Bo^^s and Shakies, and merciless Torments of (...) Chris^^^
Brethren, the savage and inhumane effusion of their Blood, that was sanctified
with Baptis^s, the Robbing, and d^m^^b^^ Poisoning of the Souls of their
Children, might in this ^^^^ing, and I hope, mature opportunity, kindle in all
Christian Hearts, the holy fire of Compassion toward the one, and fervant zeal
for God, and our Religion toward the other, that we may all with one consent,
avenge the Blood of his Martyred Servants, that have this long time under the
Altar, Revel. 6. v. 9.10 Cried for vengeance. That so we may set bounds to the
insolent and insulting Pride of that hideous Monster, and may propagate the
glorious Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Ahi no^^e indignum fuerat tot stare per annos,
Infandi caput hoc monstri implacabile territ?
There is only our thing that I am to acquaint the Reader with, that I hope it
will little offend any Learned or Judicious, that I term this Gentleman's Death
a Martyrdom, it must be remembered, it is in a Poem to which every man affords
some grain of allowance, or at least discretion will allow him so to do,
especially in the expression, much more, when it is considered, that the Word
Martyr is primarly, and Originaly Greek, and signifies no more but a Witness;
hence was that ordinary asseveration amongst the Grecians, (...). I make the
Gods my Witness, yet in almost all other Tongues, the same word being kept:
It Is applied more largely to any that has suffered Death for the love and
honor of God. So Apel, Genesis 4th and 5. And Zacharias 2d. Chr. 24.21.
Matthew 2^.35. Luke 11.51. And the Prophets that were slain by Jezebel, are by
some Fathers called Martyrs; when I say, almost all other Tongues, I except
only the Mother Hebrew, and her Daughters the Siriack and Arabic, but in other
Inferior Tongues, it is peculiarly kept, and appropriated to one that loses
his Life for a Testimony of the Truth of the Gospel of Christ. As it is
particularly applied to Antipas, Revel. 2.13. Who is supposed by Barronius, and
Pererius (who take the History from Aretas) to have been the Bishop of
Pergamus: And is said to have been tortured to death in a red hot Brazen Bull,
(the invention of the Tyrant Phaleris) about that same time, that John was cast
into the Caldron full of seething Oil. Some make the distinction, that all
Martyrs must be Confessors, but all Confessors are not Martyrs. And so the
young Children whom Herod slew in Bethlehem, must not have the Honor of that
glorious Title: Yet Barleus cal^s that infenticidium martyrij gloria prima,
where he elegantly brings in the Mothers lamenting, and calling to the Tyrant
Quid puer hic meruit tam paucis editus horis?
qui potuit sceptris noxius esse tuis.
Prima dies vitae mortis fit prima cruentae,
dum moritur lucis nescius ipse suae.
Ensem adigas dixi mea per praecordia miles,
at soholi clemens obsecro parce meae.
And generally they are called St. Innocents and Martyrs, and a day in the
Callander appointed for them. But it is concluded both by St. Cyprian, and St.
Augustine, It Is the Cause, not the Suffering makes them Martyrs. Both the
Donatists, and Circumcellions would have all voluntary Deaths to be Martyrdom.
And Pelibianus taught, that all who slew themselves for their Sins were
Martyrs, in which case, Judas might have had a principal rubric in his
Callender. But in a word, it is concluded by all Orthodox Divines, that he
properly is a Martyr, that suffers Death for the Word of God, and Testimony of
Jesus our Savior; Which honor whosoever dar deny to the Magnanimous
M^ri^^ou^, must be confessed by all honest Men, deeply guilty of presumptuous
folly; stupid Ignorance Injurious Detraction, and pernicious and disdainful
envy, from which Good Lord deliver every Christian. AMEN.

The Funeral Elegy.
MY Muse has practiced lighter griefs, but She
Has hardly strength for such a Tragedy;
^he death of Moristoun's enough to make
^h'amazed Rafters of the Sky to shake.
^reat Atlas of the Nations Fame! his Fate,
^oo glorious is for dregs of Wit to Rate.
(...) would require some high victorious Rhyme
^or to revenge his Death, and conquer Time;
^^t ye we are not surpised, sad news as these
^ould still get leave to sink in by degrees.
^^me conquers grief, and makes it melt away,
(...) Ice before the Suns dissolving Ray:
^hen may we fill the mouth of Fame with Verse,
and pour a Box of Spiknard on his Hearse,
though now remote from us (blessed Fate!) lest we
^ight with his Dust commit Idolatry:
that Saint and Martyr Moristoun! whose Breast
^eroick Valiant Courage, so possessed,
^^mself a Sacrifice for to afford,
(...) avenge th'affronts of his blasphemed Lord;
No greater Christian Honor, than to oppose,
With life's expense our Saviors spiteful foes.
^n Earth this is the Flower of all Renown,
^^d surest Title to the eternal Crown:
^e is with glorious name of Martyr blessed,
^ho with his Blood does Seal the Truths of Christ*
^ith other Foes about the Bounds we fight (...) jure (...).

^re for the whole Possession and it is Right.
^^r CHRIST and Mahumet (we may be bold
(...) affirm) that Heaven together cannot hold.
^^en blessed is he whom love of Jesus draws,
(...) lay his life down in so good a C^^^^
(...) whosoever gives his Bread unto the Poor,
(...) in his Members feeds his Savior:
^^t he who gives Himself, his Life and Blood,
(...) greater Sacrifice could give to God,
Nor richer Purchase ever (...)
Either for Honor, or for Happiness,
And this is properly our Saviors mind, Mat. ^^.^^.

He that thus loses life, his life shall find.
He who for Christ darr tread the Paths that lead
To the dark pensive Regions of the dead.
He by his Word, the eternal Crown shall wear, 2 Timothy 2.1^.

That Is more beset with Pearl, than stuffed with care.
The light afflictions which he here endured, 2 Cor. ^.1^.

F^r more excelling glorious weights afford.
Write them down blessed, said the Heavenly voice, Rev. 14.13.

No Men like them, of all they are the choice.
In Ecclesiastic History we read,
One Martyr still the way to another led;
Great is th'attractive power, example has, ^^d. Hist. Aug^. Lib. ^.

St. Alban turned his Heads man to the Faith,
And to Gods Heavenly Kingdom brought him on,
Through Martyrdom a stout Companion.
Sixius the Second, did St. Lawrence turn,
And he Romanus; for that Faith to burn
They lately persecuted, so does rise
Another Phoenix from the Bed of Spice,
And precious Odoriferous perfume,
Which both at once renews and does consume
She her own happy Heir; what ruins all,
Adds strength to her, restored by Funeral.
So surely his example will inflame
Some Heroes get to signalize their Fame*
No greater comfort to his Friends can come,
Then to believe he suffered Martyrdom.
Th^se truly are the Battles of the Lord,
That Heaven and H^nour both at once afford.
While others spend their (...) with Packs of Hounds
About their hardly unmorgaged (...)
And of Repentance never have a thought,
(The dearest Pennyworth was over bought;)
A^^tryst Devotion till that Mellow years
Has interwoven Snow amongst their Hairs.
Our Heroes, whose wise greater Soul did train
More nobly sparkling Blood through ever Vein;
Durst generously Exile himself from home,
T'embalm his glorious Fame with Martyrdom.
Who had at Luxenburgh, and Vienn' too,
Withstood the worst Falsehood or Rage could do:
To give to all the World a proof, that he
Had to degenerous fear Antipathie.
Nor Friends, nor Parents Prayers, nor Tears, could (...)
His Resolutions for this fatal Camp:
That from his Chief and him, in Peace and War,
Scotland might Honor gain from Name of KER,
And he his Family might Signalize
With this Heroic Christian enterprise,
And all might in a Sainted Rubric read,
Since the brave MORISTOUN at Buda died;
A Youth of Myriads, yet did despise
The World, and did not say, Soul take thy ease,
But had a holy passionat desire,
Elias-like, to go to Heaven with Fire:
Fighting against base Infidels, and worse,
Who what they got by fraud, defends by force.
The Actors greatness wrongs sometimes digests,
What horrid shame, Men worried thus with Beasts?
The scourge of Christendom, the Spoun of Hell,
Whether from Jew or Pagan, none can tell;
But this is sure, all Mahume^ ^verr
A Thief, a Murderer, Adulterer.
He was (who wrote his life, they all confess,)
A nastie sink of sin and wickedness:
His very Laws, in stead of good and just,
Smells nothing but of Rancor and of ^^st.
This is the Antichrist, whose whole intent's
To wallow in the Blood of Innocents,
And night and day like Devils does employ
Himself, both Souls and Bodies to destroy.
Shall Christians suffer that Ignoble Slave
Thus to possess their Lord's and Savior's Grave?
That Monster vile, that knows* no other Lord
But Rapine, and a Bloody Brandished Sword.
Buda is won, there rests for to overcome
But only Belgrad and Bysantium:
Whereof of each, such a triumphant Foil,
Will load you all with Honor and with Spoil,
May this a Flame to holy Zeal afford;
T'assist the Conquests of great Lorains Sword:
And may that Conquering Blade no measure know,
Until the insulting Sultan be brought low.
It Is Prophesi'd, that his last time is come,
He well may flee, but not out-flee his doom.
When ye have set a bounds unto his Rage,
This shall be called, The memorable Age.
If ye do not (as God forbid) overcome;
Ye'll win the glorious Crown of Martyrdom.
Had all undaunted Hearts like MORISTOVN,
Triumphs and Trophies both would be your own
His Epitaph.
HEre lies the Glory of his Name and Race,
Who Sacrificed his Life for Christian Peace
Whose Gallantry and Merit shall Renown
To the world and, the House of MORIS TOV
(...) The Great (...)
