Robin Hood's Delight: OR, A merry Combat fought against Robin Hood, little
John and Will. Scarlet, and three stout Keepers in Sherwood Forest.
To the Tune of, Robin Hood and Queen Katherine, or, Robin Hood and the
Shepherd.


There Is some will talk of Lords and Knights
down a down a down,
And some of Yeomen good,
But I will tell you of Will. Scarlet,
Little John and Robin Hood.
They were Outlaws, as it is well known,
down a etc.
And men of a noble blood;
And many a time was their valor shown
In the Forest of mercy Sherwood.
Upon a time it chanced so,
down a etc.
As Robin would have it be,
They all three would a walking go,
Some pastime for to see.
And as they walked the Forest along,
down a etc.
Upon a Midsummer day,
There was he aware of three Forresters
Clad all in green array.
With brave long Faulchions by their sides,
down a etc.
And Forrest-Bills in hand,
They called aloud to those Outlaws
And charged them to stand.
Why who are you, cried bold Robin,
down a etc.
That speaks so boldly here?
We three belong to King Henry,
And are Keepers of his Deer.
THE Devil thou art said Robin Hood,
down a etc.
I am sure it is not so:
We be Keepers in this Forest,
And that you soon shall know.
Your Coats of green lay on the ground,
down a etc.
And so will we all three,
And take your swords and bucklers round,
And try the Victory.
We be content the Keepers said,
down a etc.
We be three and no less,
Then why should we of you be afraid,
And we never did transgress.
Why if you be the Keepers in this forest,
down a etc.
Then we be three Rangers good,
And we will make you know before you do go
You met with bold Robin Hood.
We be content thou bold Outlaw,
down a etc.
Our valor here to try,
And will make you know before we go,
We will fight before we will fly.
Then come draw your swords you bold Outlaws,
down a etc.
And no longer stand to prate,
But let us try it out with blows,
For Cowards we do hate.
Here is one of us for Will. Scarlet,
down a etc.
And another for little John,
And I my self for Robin Hood,
Because he is stout and strong.
So they fell to it full hardy and sore,
down a etc.
It was on a Midsummers day,
From eight a clock till two and past,
They all showed gallant play.
There Robin and Will. and little John,
down a etc.
They fought most manfully,
Till all their wind was spend and gone,
Then Robin aloud did cry.
O hold, O hold, cries bold Robin,
down a etc.
I see you be stout men,
Let me blow one blast with my beagle horn,
Then i will fight with you again.
That bargin is to make bold Robin Hood,
down a etc.
Therefore we it deny:
Though a blast upon thy beagle horn
Cannot make us fight nor fly.
Therefore fall on or else be gone,
down a etc.
And yield to us the day,
It shall never be said that we were afraid
Of thee nor thy Yeomen gay.
It that it be so, cries bold Robin,
down a etc.
Let me but know your names,
And in the Forest of mercy Sherwood
I shall extol your Fames.
And with our names one of them said,
down a etc.
What have thou here to do?
Except that thou will fight it out,
Our names thou shall not know.
We will fight no more, says bold Robin,
down a etc.
You be men of valor stout,
Come and go with me to Nottingham,
And there we will fight it out.
With a Butt of Sack we will bang it out,
down a etc.
To see who wins the day,
And for the cost make you no doubt,
I have gold and money to pay.
And ever hereafter so long as we live,
down a etc.
We all will brethren be,
For I love those men with heart and hand,
That will fight and never flee.
So a way they went to Nottingham,
down a etc.
With Sack to make amends,
For three days space they wine did chase,
And drank themselves good friends,
down a down a down a down.
