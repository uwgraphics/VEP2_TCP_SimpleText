ENGLANDS TRIUMPH. OR THE RUMP ROUTED By the true Assertor of Englands
Interest, General George Monck.
A SONET
To the Tune of, Fill up the Parliament full.
WHat makes the Soldiers
To stand to their Arms?
It Is for what they protest
To keep us from harms,
The Members Secluded
Come now in by Swarms
To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full.
To fill up the Parliament Full.
You know that the City Gates
Late were thrown down,
The Walls too were ordered
By Parliament Frown:
But General Monck, has pleased
Soldier and Gown,
And filled up the Parliament
And filled up the Parliament Full.
A dispute there was had
By the Members Secluded,
Brave Monck was the Umpire
And found them Deluded,
But Englands great joy
Is now wholly Concluded:
For he is filled up the Parliament Full, full, fu^^
He Is filled up the Parliament full.
Sir Arthur the Valiant
Must make his speech Large,
Lest the Members Excluded
Lay Treason to's Charge,
He Would better to have dealt
With his Newcastle Barge,
Than to see the Old Parliament Full, full, full
Than to see the Old Parliament full.
The Aldermen Grave,
And the Commons o'th City,
Imprisoned were
The more is the Pity,
But General Monck said,
That I will acquit ye,
For the Parliament now shall be full, full, full
For the Parliament now shall be full:
Have you not seen
Fresh flowers in the Spring;
And have you not heard
A Cage-Bird to sing?
But if the Cage-Members
Would bring in the King --
It would fill up the Parliament Full, full, full;
It would fill up the Parliament full.
The Parliament now will
Come into their Geers,
For Secluded PRYN
(That once lost his Ears)
Marched in with his Rapier
For Commons and Peers,
To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full,
To fill up the Parliament full.
Whose often Declaring
Has furnished the Nation
With Parliament Arguments
Of the old Fashion,
And would have both
King, Lords and Peers in this Nation
To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full
To fill up the Parliament full.
Our brave General Monck
We bound are to thank,
The Honest Lord Fairfax
Has played (too) his Prank
No thanks to be given
To the Rump nor the Shank
To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full
To fill up the Parliament full.
Had the City never moved,
Nor the Prentices strove,
They Would lost their Old Charter:
But MONCK had a love
To challenge the Grand Ones
Which Mischiefs did move;
And so filled up the Parliament Full, full, full,
And so filled up the Parliament full.
