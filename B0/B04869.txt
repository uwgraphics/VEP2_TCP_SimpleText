SOund up the Trumpet, beat up the Drum,
let not a Soul be subject to fear,
Since the true pride of all Christendom,
does against France in valor appear:
The Courageous worthy Seamen,
does from all parts to London advance,
For Englands promotion, they will fight on the Ocean,
against all the strength and power of France.
The last Engagement with the French Fleet,
has so enraged true English Boys,
That they resolve to make them retreat
with the loud Cannons thundering noise;
Not a Soul among them daunted,
but to the Seas they'st freely advance,
On Board they do enter, and Lives they will (...)
to pull down (...) pride and power of France.
Pray would it not the, Kingdom provoke,
if we should to a Tyrant bow?
But we will never come under his Yoke,
he must not think to Cope with us now;
For his Arbitrary Power,
never shall to great Britain advance,
Our valliant brave Seamen, will keep us all Frem(...)
and pull down the pride and power of France.
Did he not drive his Subject of late,
out of their native Country dear?
Those that were rich did leave their Estate,
naked and poor they came to us here:
Should that Tyrant gain this Kingdom,
the very same would be our hard chance,
His Fleet we will fire, or make them retire,
and pull down the strength and power of France
Therefore brave Seamen valliantly go,
for to preserve this Nation from thrall,
Rather than never Couquer this Foe,
they do resolve to fight one and all;
From the brave Seaport of Weymouth,
sixty true souls did freely advance,
They needed no pressing, for by Heavens blessing,
they'st pull down the pride and power of France.
Norfolk brave Lads shall not be forgot,
Seamen they are that never will flinch;
With Cannons hot, and thundering shot,
they do resolve to pepper the French;
Six score came from thence to London,
who in the Wars will hazard their chance,
Stout Lads brisk and airy, for William and Mary,
they will help for to check the power of France.
Bristow that ancient City of fame,
still will stand up our Rights to restore,
Sailers from thence most valliantly come,
now one hundred and fifty or more:
Valliant seamen, sons of thunder,
who in the Wars will venture their chance,
for the preservation of their native nation,
they will fight against all the power of France.
Every seaport all over the Land,
seamen comes in with joy and delight,
Being resolved with Courage to stand,
still to maintain the Protestants right,
Since their Lives they freely venture,
Englands Glory still to advance;
May Heaven defend them, and blessings attend them
who fights against all the power of France.
