BY THE KING.
A Proclamation commanding Captains and Commanders of Soldiers to attend
their charge.
OUR Sovereign Lord the King being informed, That diverse Commanders,
Captains, Lieutenants, and other Officers of the Armies, Garrisons, and Forces
now in His Majesty's pay as well in Ireland, as in the Low Countries, have too
frequently resorted, and are at this present within this Realm, and do absent
themselves from their several charges and commands, and considering that
thereupon not only much dissolutenes and neglect of warlike discipline in their
Troops and Companies must necessarily ensue, but also great danger to the
service and employment wherein they are placed, is manifestly threatened
thereby. His Majesty willing to reform an abuse of so perilous consequence by
the advice of His Privy Council does signify and declare His Royal pleasure,
and does straightly charge and command, that all the said Commanders,
Captains, Lieutenants, and other Officers (except only those that are already
designed, and appointed to serve in the Fleet, or Army now at, or near
Plymmouth for the time that they shall attend that service) do forth with
return and repair to their several charges, and there attend and perform
the duties and services incident to their places. And that they, nor any of
them do hereafter absent themselves from their several commands, but only
upon just leave obtained for some pressing and urgent occasion upon pain to
loose their said Offices and places, and to be further punished according to
their demerits.

Given at the Court at Tichfeld the fourth day of September, in the first year
of his Majesty's Reign of great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
