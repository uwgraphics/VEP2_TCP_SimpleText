THE CASE OF THE Makers of Vinegar.
IN the Bill for an Additional Duty of Excise, there is a New Duty laid upon
Vinegar, or Liquors prepared for Vinegar, which Duty so laid, will prevent the
making of Vinegar in England: For that the Liquor for making of Vinegar is
drawn off from one Cask to another several times in a day, for Two Months
together, and more, with great waste; So that to take an Account thereof, the
Officer must always continue in the Makers House, by which means the Makers
will be forced to show their Art to every Officer; and the burden will be so
great upon them, that they will not be able to follow their Trade: But if any
persons do continue to make Vinegar, the Charge to Their Majesty's, to take an
Account, will in probability be as much as the Duty.

There never was any attempt to lay a Duty upon Liquor prepared for Vinegar,
nor was there a Duty ever laid upon Vinegar when made, because the Materials
used to make the same, Pays a great Duty to Their Majesty's.

The Makers of Vinegar Use Eager-Wine, Lees of Wine, and Beer Brewed purposely
by the Common Brewer.

Wine, when Imported, Pays a great Duty, and Eager-Wine is fit for no other Use
but to make Vinegar; and if the Merchant cannot Sell his Eager-Wine here, he
will Export the same, and draw back near half the Duty, which will very much
lessen Their Majesty's Revenue. All which the Makers of Vinegar are ready to
make appear.
