The Covetous Mother, Or, The terrible Overthrow of Two Loyal Lovers.
You that these woeful tidings hear,
surely your hearts may bleed;
Who can forbear to shed a tear,
when they these lines shall read?
Tune of, O^^ (...) a creature.

This may be printed, R. P.





THere was a wealthy young Squire,
whom a fair Damosel did love;
Nay, and it was so entire,
nothing his fancy could move:
She born of ordinary Parents.
which when his Friends this did know,
They strove to set them at variance,
proving their sad overthrow.
Son, said his indulgent Mother,
pray you now listen to me;
I have considered another
suitable to-your degree;
That you may rise to promotion,
she is both virtuous and fair,
Two thousand pound to her Portion;
therefore your folly forbear.
Mother, those Charms does inflame me
which in my Dear I behold;
Therefore I pray do not blame me,
True Love is better than Gold.
Might I have Wealth out of measure,
nothing my mind can remove;
I Will never marry for Treasure,
give me the Creature I love.






I can maintain like a Lady
she whom I much do adore;
Have I not Riches already?
what need I covet for more?
If you give me not one penny,
I have a Hundred a Year:
Now if I marry with any,
it shall be Nancy my Dear.
Son, if your Love be so rooted
that from her you cannot part,
By me it shall not be disputed,
take her then with all my heart.
But she in this was deceitful,
as by this Ditty you will find,
Never was action more hateful,
Malice remained in her mind.
Straight she repaired to this Creature.
vowing to send away;
Yet with a smile she did meet her,
saying, dear Daughter this day
We will go buy your Attire,
every thing i will provide;
It Is my unfeigned desire,
that you shall be my Sons Bride.
Thus was the matter contrived.
just as his Mother would have;
Then to a Captain in private
she sold her to be a Slave:
She from Old England did send her,
filled with much sorrow and woe;
There was no Soul to defend her,
but was compelled to go.
When her invention was over,
then she returned to her Son,
Freely to him to discover,
presently what she had done:
When he heard what she had acted,
his Rapier straight he pulled forth.
Raving like one quite distracted,
crying, you have ruined us both.
Then on the point of his Rapier
he did immediately fall;
His Life did go out like a Taper,
this was the ruin of all.
His Mother more than uncivil,
was of a covetous mind:
Money the Root of all evil
caused this confusion we find.
Now does his Mother with weeping
weary out many a day;
While her dear Son he lies sleeping
low in a cold Bed of Clay.
This is a sad Desolation,
she whom he much did adore,
Now is sent far from the Nation,
where she will never see him more
