THE COBBLERS LAST Will and Testament: Or, The Lord HEWSON'S Translation.
I.
TO Christians all I greeting send,
That they may learn their souls to mend
By viewing of my Cobler's End.
II,
First, to the New Lords I would give All,
But that (like me) they are like to fall,
Though Heartless Fleetwood has no Gall,
III.
Yet he deserves this Legacy,
ROPE take you all, well may I cry,
You're Murderers as well as I.
IV.
And will thus (Wry-neck) end your race,
Since wilful Murder has no place
In the late Parliaments Act of Grace.
V.
My Paring-Knife I Will Lambert give,
He may have use on'c if he live,
For's Throat as well as his Brow, I believe.
VI.
But Richard and Harry I have forgot,
Shall I give them my Hammers? No, I will not,
For they did not strike while the Iron was hot.
VII.
Vane take my Bends, and Wilks my Clue,
Atkins my Hose of Saffron Hue;
But Gregory says my Clothes are his due.
VIII.
My Cushion will fit Queen Dowager Cromwell,
Whilst Shipton Wife's Prophecy she does thumb-wel,
In Chair of State 'twil ease her Bum-wel.
IX.
For Oliver thou did set me on high,
I aimed not at it, though I winkt of an eye,
Yet I wish not now to come thee nigh.
X.
For sure ere this thou wilt burn with thy nose,
Which out of thy nosth rills brimstone throws;
Would thou were here to singe my foes.
XI.
There is another Lord that is Rich,
To cure the City whose fingers did itch,
But only I went thorow-stitch.
XII.
And yet they say I was out of my trade,
When as Phlebotomy I made;
Some Surgeon to do it, I Would better have paid.
XIII.
Ill-looking-death turn back thy shaft,
If Charon me ore-Styx should waft,
It would disgrace our Gentle-craft.
XIV.
In The Good Old Cause I traded still,
But in it my Lordship smelt some ill,
To mend it though, proved past my skill.
XV.
Therefore to Tyburn I must ride,
Although it cannot be denied,
But that I have lived single-ey'd.
XVI.
And if my foes would do me right,
They Will say, I Have set the crooked straight,
Why then I am a man upright.
XVII.
I wish the Jury find it so,
John Lilburns Jury would say, no;
Stitch up the Lord, let the Cobbler go.
XVIII.
But it is no jesting matter I trow,
For I cannot laugh, although you do;
Yet may make a wry-mouth, or so.
XIX.
Before when we debauched the Nation,
We could have vouched our Reformation,
By a day or two of Humiliation.
XX.
Now it is not current pay, for I
Have wail'd my sins, and yet they cry,
Hang him, he weeps but with one eye.
