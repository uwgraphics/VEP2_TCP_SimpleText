Bishops.
To Our Right Trusty and Right welb^loved Counselors, the Lords Archbishops,
and our right Trusty and VVelbeloved, the Bishops of Our Ancient Kingdom of
Scotland.
JAMES R.

RIght Trusty and Right welb^loved Counselors, and Right Trusty and
welbeloved, We Greet you well; We have received your most dutiful Letter, of
the third day of November, in which We are glad to see, that you are far from
being of the number of those Spiritual Lords, whom the Prince of Orange
pretends to have been Invited by; As We have likewise had repeated Assurances
from all the Bishops of England, of their Innocence in that, and Duty to Us: We
have now thought fit by this to tell you, how sensible We are of your Zeal for
Our Service, and for the dutiful Expressions of your Loyalty to Us, in a time
when all Arts are used to Seduce Our Subjects from their Duty to Us. We Do
likewise take Notice of your Diligence in your Duty, by your Inculcating to
those under your Charge, these Principles which have always been Owned, Taught
and Published by that Protestant, Loyal Church, you are truly Members of: We
Do assure you of Our Royal Protection to you, your Religion, Church and Clergy,
and that We will be careful of your Concerns, when ever there shall be a
suitable occasion offered to Us; you, and every one of you, being most
perfectly in Our Royal Protection and Favor. And so We bid you heartily
Farewell.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the 15 day of November 1688. And of Our
Reign, the 4th year. By His Majesty's Command, MELFORT.

Edinburgh, Printed by the Heir of Andrew Anderson, Printer to His most Sacred
Majesty, 1688.
