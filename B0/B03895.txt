Jack Had-Lands Lamentation,
That sold and made away his 'State,
And spent his Money early and late;
And let his Wife and Children want,
Now he makes great moan and does repent;
And desires all good-fellows where e're they be,
To take warning of his poverty.
He was cast in Prison at that bout,
His poor Wife she helped him out;
She had small reason to do that thing
But true love is a gallant thing;
There is scarce a Tap-house in London town
Will help a Man when he is cast down.
To the Tune of, It is Old Ale that has undone me.
This may be Printed,

R. P.





TO all Good-fellows I Will declare,
To take Example and have a care.
And do not spend your Means in waste,
For you will repent it at the last:
For I my self was blindly led,
And made all away, I was so bad;
Let all I say be warned by me,
Of drinking and bad company.
I had Land and Living of my own,
And a fine Estate, it was well known;
It was worth threescore pound a year,
And I spent it all in A^e and Beer,
My Hostess was all my delight,
And I sat up swilling day and night.
Let all I say, etc.
I never took no care at all,
God knows I had a sudden fall;
I sold my 'State then all away,
To maintain the Alehouse night and day.
My Wife and Children was so poor,
Neighbors cried shame at me therefore,
Let all I say, etc.
I would come home drunk unto my Wife,
And lead her such a weary life,
And she would speak me then so fair,
And entreat me with a lovely ca^e;
And say, good Husband be content,
Alas! you will these things repent:
Let all I say be warned by me,
Of drinking and bad company.




My little naked Children, they
Were almost pined, as Neighbors say,
And starved so sore for want of Close,
I had no care of them God knows;
Now all is gone, and nothing left,
I may say, farewell Dagger with dudgeon and Haft:
Let all I say, etc.
I cast my self into some Debt,
And was arrested then for it;
Because that I could get no Bail,
They cast me in a nasty Gaile;
And there I lay from my poor Wife,
She relieved me or I had lost my life:
Let all I say, etc.
When I was in that misery,
Never an Ale-wife that would come to me;
For all I had spent my 'State away,
I had no help of them I say:
But my poor wife was my best friend,
And succored me unto the end:
Let all I say, etc.
Then my poor wife she sought about,
And she made a friend and got me out;
She sold her Wedding-Ring away,
To pay my Fees without delay;
And did so rejoice at my release,
And brought me home again in peace:
Let all I say, etc.
Now all is spent I plainly see,
There is no help nor no remedy,
But labor hard and work full sore,
That money will be better then all before
And bring it home unto my Wife,
And love her as I love my life:
Let all I say, etc,
A man that has a state or has good means
Never use so much these tippling Queans
They drown your money so very sore,
And make you at the last be poor;
I am sure that I may say the same,
But alas, alas, I was to blame:
Let all I say, etc.
Let every one that goes along,
Take notice of this new-made Song,
And take examble now by me,
That am fallen into this Poverty;
I wish that I might be the last,
But alack-aday, I am not the first:
Let all I say, etc.
So to conclude to end the strife,
Let every man love his own Wife;
And save his money, and keep his store,
Drink not too much to make you poor,
A man that has Grace will then repent,
To see his Wife and Children live in want*
Let all I say, be warned be me,
Of Drinking and lewd Company,
Printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden-Ball in Pye-Corner.
