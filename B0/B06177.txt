The Traitors Downfall, OR, A brief relation of the downfall of that Phanatick
crew who Traitorously Murdered the Late Kings Majesty of blessed Memory.
To the Tune of, Fa la la, etc:
portrait of Charles I

CHarles the first was a noble King,
with a fa la la la lero,
His fame throughout the world did ring,
with a fa, etc.
But those that did presume so high,
To murder our good Kings Majesty,
Now may these Rebels howl and cry,
with a fa la la lalero.
He was a Prince of courage stout,
with a fa, etc.
Althouh his glass was soon run out,
with a fa, etc.
But behind him he has left a Noble stock
May give a Traitor a handsome knock,
For making a king to submit to the block.
with a fa, etc.
The blood that he lost as I suppose,
with a fa, etc.
Caused fire to rise in Olivers Nose,
with a fa, etc.
His rousing Nose did bear such asway,
It cast such a heat in shining ray,
That England scarce knew the night from day
with a fa, etc.
Oliver was of Huntington,
with a fa, etc.
Born he was a Brewers son,
with a fa, etc.
He soon forsook his dray and flings,
And counted a Brewers house a pitiful thing
When he came to the stately throne of a king:
with a fa, etc.
Oliver had a heart of gall,
with a fa, etc.
For to murder his Prince at White Hall,
with a fa, etc.
He swore who ever was over the main,
Whether a French King or a Spain,
Yet in England no King should remain,
with a fa, etc.
The second part
to the same Tune.


DUke Humphery was the first Protector
with a fa, etc.
Henry the sixth the next Protector,
with a fa, etc.
Then thirdly Oliver he took place.
But Lucifer soon removed his grace,
Then he set up young Dick the fool of his race,
with a fa, etc.
No sooner was Dick got up to the Throne,
with a fa, etc.
But he considered it was none of his own,
with a fa, etc.
And staring this way and that way about:
Desiring to be resolved a doubt.
Then in came Lambert and turned him out
with a fa, etc.
Fleetwood desirous of the place,
with a fa, etc.
Sent forth Lambert the Scot to face,
with a fa, etc.
And being in the strength of his desire,
When he did think poor Iockey to brier,
His men forsook him and left him in the mier.
with a fa, etc.
Thus you may see how some do rise,
with a fa, etc.
With an intent to surmount the Skies
with a fa, etc.
But when they are up they shall have a fall,
Witness Fleetwood blind Hewson, and all,
The raged rout of a Cobblers stall,
with a fa, etc.
We have cleared White Hall of Lobsters and Geese,
with a fa, etc.
Turned Rump and Kidneys out of the house
with a fa, etc.
We have brought in Charles from over the main
Make wars with France and peace with Spain.
Now we shall get money and trading again
with a fa, etc.
Citizens look to your selves I say,
with a fa, etc.
Let no Cobblers preach and pray:
with a fa, etc.
Tom Cobbler is flown the Lord kno'ns whither
Fleetwood and he I hope are together,
Now we have braught in the King and weel have fair weather
with a fa,
Blind Hewson was not of our kind,
with a fa, etc.
To run a way and leave his men behind,
with a fa,
But I wish I could find him by the sent,
There Is neither that law nor ye rump parliament
Should save him from death to give us content
with a fa la la la lalero.
A list of the names of those Traitors that were hanged; drawn, and quartered
for murdering our Sovereign of blessed memory, Charles the first.
