THE CASE OF Many Inhabitants of the Town of DEPTFORD, in the County of Kent;
many of which are Innholders and Victuallers,
To the Honorable the House of Commons in Parliament Assembled.
WHereas the said Inhabitants did, at the latter End of the last Sessions of
Parliament, deliver their Case to this Honorable House; which was as follows:

That the said Inhabitants from time to time, as often as occasion has been,
entertained Sick and Wounded Seamen, sent on Shore from His Majesty's Ships,
during all the time of the late War, and have furnished them with Meat, Drink,
Washing, Lodging, and all other Necessaries for their Subsistence.

That the said Inhabitants, by such Subsistence, have run themselves into very
many and great Debts with their Brewers, Bakers, Butchers, and other Tradesmen,
for Three or Four Years together.

And since the delivery of the abovesaid Case, the New Commissioners for that
Office have discharged the Debts for the Sick and Wounded Men at all the Ports
of this Kingdom, from the First of July School, to the Thirtieth of September
1699. And though the former Commissioners have often been solicited on that
Account, being in Arrears to this, as also to most, if not all the Ports of the
Kingdom, from the Year 1695, to the Last of June School; yet nothing has nor can
be obtained of them, They alleging they have not any Money to discharge the
same, which occasions the Creditors of the said Inhabitants to act with greater
Severity toward them.

That the said Inhabitants are become so very Poor, by having entertained
Seamen upon His Majesty's Account, (having mortgaged and made away all that
they had) that they and their Families, must unavoidably perish, if not timely
relieved, several of them having been Arrested by their said Creditors, and
Others withdrawn from their Habitations, to the utter Ruin of their Families.

Wherefore the said Inhabitants most Humbly beg, That this Honorable House
would be pleased to take their most miserable and deplorable Condition into
Your serious Considerations; and to grant them such Relief therein as Your
Honors shall think convenient; that thereby they may regain their former
Credit, and be enabled still to supply the said Sick and Wounded Seamen for His
Majesty's Service.
