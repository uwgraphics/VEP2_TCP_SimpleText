The DUCHESS of PORTSMOUTHs Farewell:
The Duchess holds a Dialogue,
and talks with Madam Gwin;
Yea, does relate the wretched state,
that now she lives in.
To the Tune of, Tan tarra rara tan tivee.




I Prithee dear Portsmouth now tell me thy mind
with a fa, la, la, la, fa, la la,
Do thou not think that the Fates are unkind,
with a fa la, etc.
It is not long since thy fame it was great,
But now it is eclips^d by unkindness of fate,
Thy case now does seem a sad tale to relate,
with a fa la la la, fa la la.
Ah! Nell could I but my sorrow explain,
with a fa la, etc.
Which fisteth my heart with sorrow and pain,
with a fa la, etc.
(...) from mine (...) I should certainly weep,
(...) of the Ocean so deep,
(...) friend lies fast in his sleep.
with a fa la, etc.


Magnificent splendour did on thee attend,
with a fa la, etc.
And now I would have thee thy life to amend,
with a fa la, etc.
On rich and on poor, Dame Fortune does frown,
Thou from thy great honor art tumbled down,
It is not thy money thy actions can crown,
with a fa la, etc.
Add not to my sorrow now I am perplexed,
with a fa la, etc.
For ought I do know Nell thou may be the next,
with a fa la, etc.
Then seem not at my distress for to scorn,
To happiness lasting few people is born,
And I like my self am now left forlorn,
with a fa la, etc.
What must thou return to thy country of France
with a fa la, etc,
Or will not thy chastity here thee advance,
with a fa la, etc.
What have thou forsook thy most amorous trade,
Or have thou left off the game thou have played,
Though not one in ten rook thee for a Maid,
with a fa la, etc.
These quirks are too quick you do put on me Nell,
with a fa la, etc.
And thou thine own self, love the sport very well,
with a fa la, etc.
Then (...) not one another deride,
For (...) many Gallants that love it beside,
But (...) I fear now will pull down my pride,
with a fa la, etc.
Your beauty and vertus now seem to decline,
with a fa la, etc.
I know not how soon your fate may be mine,
with a fa la, etc.
Now unstring your purse, and be kind to the poor,
I know that confinement you cannot endure,
There is nothing on earth that is stable and sure,
with a fa la, etc.
You seem Nell with speed for to post me a way,
with a fa la, etc.
But e're I go hence my debts I must pay,
with a fa la, etc.
And is not this now a most sorrowful thing,
That I who had the great world in a sling,
Must now in this plight most mournfully sing,
with a fa la, etc.
But Madam from hence you sent treasure away;
with a fa la, etc.
And here I suppose that a while you must stay,
with a fa la, etc.
But what I my self have got by my game,
I freely in England expended the same,
But you hane transported yours to your shame,
with a fa la, etc.
But one of my Sisters has suffered before,
with a fa la, etc,
She I do remember was called lane-shore;
with a fa la, etc.
For now I am possessed with sorrow and fear,
And in my fad dreams strange visions appear,
I have lost my best friend that I loved so dear,
with a fa la, fa la la.
