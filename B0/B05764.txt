The Seamans Song of Danse^ar the Duchman, his robberies done at Sea.
To the same tune,


SIng we ( Seaman) now and than
Of Dansekar the Duchman,
whose gallant mind has won him great renown
To live an land he counts it base
But seeks to purchase greater grace,
by Robing on the Ocean up and down,
His heart is so aspiring
That now his chief desiring
Is for to win himself a worthy name
The Land has far too little ground,
The Sea is of a larger bound,
and of a greater dignity and fame.
Now many a worthy Gallant
Of courage now most valiant,
with him has put their fortunes to the Sea,
All the worth about have heard
Of Dansekar and English Ward,
and of their proud adventures every day
There is not a Kingdom
In Turkey or in Christendom,
but by these Pirates have received loss
Merchant men of every Land,
Do daily in great danger stand
and fear to much the Ocean main to cross,
They make Children fatherless
Woeful widows in distress
in shedding blood they took too much delight.
Fathers they bereave of sons,
Regardin^ neither cries nor moans,
so much they joy to see a bloody fight.
They count it gallant hearing
To hear the Canons roaring,
and Musket Shot to rattle in the sky.
Their glories would so at the highest
To fight against the foes of Christ
and such as do our Christian faith deny.
But their cursed Villainies
And their bloody Pyracies.
are chiefly bent against our Christian friends
Some Christians so delight in evils,
That they become the sons of Devils
and for the same have many shameful ends
England suffers danger
As well as any stranger,
Nations are alike unto his company,
Many English Merchant men,
And of London now and then,
have tasted of their vile extremity,
Londons Elizabeth
Of late these Rovers taken have,
a ship well laden with rich Merchandise
The nimble Pearl and Charity
All ships of gallant bravery,
all these are made a lawful prize,
The Trojan of London
With other ships many a one,
has stooped sail and yielded out of hand,
These Pirates they have shed their bloods,
And the Turks have bought their goods,
being all too weak their power to withstand,
Of Hull and Bonaventer
Which was a great frequenter
and passer of the Straits to Barbary,
Both Ship and men late taken were,
By Pirates Ward and Dansekar,
and brought by them into Captivity.
English Ward and Dansekar
Being greatly now to jar,
about dividing of their gotten goods
Both Ships and Soldiers gather head
Dacsekar from Ward is fled,
so full of pride and malice are their bloods
Ward does only promise
To keep about rich Tunis,
and be Commander of those Turkish Seas
But valiant Duchland Dansekar,
Does hover near unto Argier,
and there his threatening colors now displays
These Pirates thus divided
By God is sure provided
in seceret sort to work each others woe,
Such wicked courses cannot stand,
The Devil thus puts in his hand,
and God will soon give them an overthrow.
