Toms-Son his Repetition to his Wife; Bewailing his present state.
To the Tune of, Young JEMMY.
^

Will you hear of Tom'sons Dream?
then take you care no further;
To me it once did seem
Godfrey himself did Murder:
This Story I did boldly tell,
and some thereof did hear;
Now Liberty I bid farewell,
What Course now shall I Steer
2
For this I went to Goal,
which grievously did vex me,
I now go under Bail,
which sorely does perplex me;
My two great Friends Farewell and Pain,
once put me in good cheer,
But now they do deny't again,
What course then shall I steer?
3
Then Farewell Farewell now,
I see thy Friends have left thee,
Thou to thy Fate must bow,
of Joys I have bereft thee:
I wish that thou could quit thy self,
or I my self could clear,
I fear it will impair my Health,
O what course shall I steer?
4
That Noble Loyal heart,
the Duke of Monmouth called,
The world knows his Desert,
whom some would have Inthralled:
In spite of all their wicked Deeds,
himself he still keeps clear,
But now with Guilt my heart it bleeds,
And what course shall I steer?
5
Thrice Worthy Shaftsbury;
has been too much abused,
Sir Robert Cleyton he,
by me has been misused:
The Chamberlain of London too,
whose Candor seems clear,
With many of the Honest Crew,
Now what course shall I steer?
There Is many a Worthy Knight,
within great Londons City,
In Loyalty delight,
and it is the more the pity
That they should be by Knaves Aspersed,
whose Actions are so clear,
My Fault can never be Reversed,
O what course shall I steer?
6
A Synod may be called
of Loyal-hearted Nobles,
Once for their Worth Installed,
who grieve to see our Troubles:
They for their gracious Sovereign King,
will venture Lives most dear,
To punishment Offenders bring,
Then what course shall I steer?
7
O would that I had been
a Stranger to these Stories,
He Is doubly Guilt of Sin,
who in Transgression glories:
And happy's he who sleeps in peace,
whose Conscience is most clear,
For now my Sorrows do increase,
And what course shall I steer?
