An Answer to the The Unfortunate Lady. Who Hanged her self in Despair:
Containing her Lovers Lamentation for her Untimely Destiny; Together with the
Apparition of her Bleeding Ghost in his silent Chamber.
To the Tune of, The Languishing Swain.
Licensed according to Order.

I.
What dismal tidings do I hear,
The fatal ruin of my Dear,
Who did her dearest Life destroy,
When she might not her Love enjoy.
II.
Which grieves me to the very Soul,
In sorrow I her Death condole;
No peace nor comfort can I find,
The thoughts of her runs in my mind.
III.
Each Night when e're I close mine Eyes,
Methinks I hear her dismal Cries,
Saying, my Love I died for thee;
And then her bleeding Ghost I see.
IV.
Then with a Voice both sharp and shrill,
She does my silent Chamber fill,
And with a sigh and bitter groan,
She does express her piteous moan.
V.
Alas! although I did appear
Thus in the Chamber of my Dear,
He never wronged his Lover, no,
'Twas Parents proved my overthrow.
VI.
I know the tender Turtle-Doves,
Was never more constant to their Loves,
Then thee and I has been, she cried,
And yet, alas! for Love I died.
VII.
I was to thee as dear as Life,
My Friends has caused all the strife;
They sought for Wealth and Riches store,
When Love had won the Field before.
VIII.
'Cause thou did not in Wealth abound
My near Relations on thee frowned,
And I was posted straight from thee,
And by that means have ruined me.
IX.
They sent me word that thou were Wed
Which tidings almost struck me dead;
Unto Despair I straight did run,
O see what cursed Gold has done!
X.
Then with a sigh and dismal groan,
She straight departs, leaves me alone;
Where I in sorrow weeping lie,
To think of Parents Cruelty.
XI.
Sure Friends was never more to blame,
How could they such a Letter frame,
That I another Choice had made?
By this her Life they soon betrayed.
XII.
She well might be amazed, that I
Should guilty be of Perjury,
And leave a loyal Love at last,
When many solemn Vows had past.
XIII.
She Is gone, and I am left behind:
Now since I can no Comfort find;
Come Death and prove a Friend to me,
O let me Dye as well as she:
FINIS.
