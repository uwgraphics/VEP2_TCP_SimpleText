Reasons why Addition should be made to the Tithes formerly Paid.
1. THat the Rates for Tithes heretofore were much greater, and sunk thus low
as they have been of late years, as by other ways, so especially by Letting
Houses at under Rents, with quarterly Fines. 2. That the Tithes thus lessened,
are a slender and incompetent Maintenance to invite and encourage persons of
such worth, as it is fit the City of London, should from time to time be
supplied withal. 3. That these Rates of Tithes thus Diminished, would have
been as plentiful a Maintenance an hundred years ago, as the same now doubled.
4. That the shortness of the Settled Maintenance, making voluntary Contributions
necessary for a Livelihood, has been and may be a temptation to Popular
Compliances. 5. That the Glebes which were formerly a considerable advance, are
since the Fire generally lessened in their Rents two thirds, and the Parsonage
and Vicarage Houses being Demolished, they must either be rebuilt with great
Charge, or others taken at great Rents. 6. That the Charges of a Family are
much greater in the City than elsewhere. 7. That the short and discouraging
Maintenance of the Orthodox and Conformable Clergy, tends to the encouragement
and upholding of Conventicles. 8. That it is upon good grounds believed, That
the Rates propounded, together with the Reserved Dues of Impropriators, will
not in the whole, one place with another, exceed Six pence in the Pound of
yearly Rent moderately estimated.
