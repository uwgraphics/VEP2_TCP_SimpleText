The Faithful Lovers Farvvell: OR, Private News fromChatham,
Described in a passionate Discourse betwixt a young Gentleman whose name was
John, and his fair Lady Betty, who having been newly Contracted, were suddenly
Separated before Marriage, in regard that he was instantly Commanded to take
Shipping in an Expedition against the DUTCH.

To the Tune of, My Lodging is on the cold ground, etc.


AS I in a Meddow was walking,
some two or three Weeks ago,
I heard two Lovers a Talking,
and trampling too and fro;
The Female her name was Betty,
her dearly Beloved was John,
And both of them wondrous pretty,
(I Will tell you the rest anon)
These Lovers were both combined
in mutual bonds of Love,
But John was straightly enjoined
a little while to remove,
From her he did love above all things,
his fervent desire was such;
He now does intend to do tall things,
By Engageing against the Dutch.
Betty. It Was Betty that first complained,
Oh! why will you use me so,
As soon as affection is gained,
so speedily can you go,
And leave me in pyning sorrow
distressed upon the Shore;
If you do depart to Morrow
I never shall see thee more.

John. My dear (quoth John) be not daunted,
(and smilingly looked upon her)
My Service it cannot be wanted,
I'le-bring thee both Wealth and Honor;
I cannot now well support thee,
and live like other Men*
But with Gold and silver I will Court thee
When I come a Shore again.

Betty. (Quoth Betty) some other way studdy
to live with me here on Shore;
The Battle will be very bloody,
when all the great Guns do Roar,
Thou Wilt either be drowning or burning
in Crimson Waves of Gore,
Whilst I sit here in my mourning,
And never shall see thee more.

The second Part,
to the same Tune.


John. QVoth John, prithee leave thy dreaming
and be an obedient Wife,
I scorn that a Butter-box Flemming
should vapor away my Life;
The Duke of York ventures his life too
with all his Royalty;
He Is a Prince that does love his wife too
I warrant as well as I.
Good Princes are great Examples
for Loyal hearts to follow:
He that on Authority tramples.
I wish the Sea may swallow,
The Dutchman was ever a Traitor
against their Sovereign;
We will make it cost him hott water
E're I come a Shore again.
We Will beat the Belgick-Boobies,
and gain their Guinny-Gold,
I Will bring the home Pearls and Rubies
as many as my Ship will hold;
I Will make my Betty shine Splendid
with Treasuries of the Main,
And royally be attended
When I come a Shore again.

Betty. Then Betty with a whimpring face
returned these words again,
I Will put me on a Masculine Case,
and pass for one of your Men;
I Will swear (if you will believe me)
I Will fear no Wind nor Weather,
For I know it never will grieve me
If both of us dye together.

John. My Dear, I prithee leave pleading,
thou shall not to Sea with me,
For I can tell by my reading
it will not convenient be,
Thou rather wilt hurt, and hinder me,
when we begin the Fray,
When Cleopatra put to Sea
Mark Anthony lost the day.
My very soul presages,
we shall be Victorious Men,
And cut out work for Stages
when we return again.

Bett. Quoth she, I Will daily pray for thee
and every Power implore.

Ioh. I Will fight (quoth. he) Oh then quoth she
I never shall see the more.

John. Said he, this Kiss a farewell gives
my time is drawing on,
He needs must go whom Honor drives.

Bett. Quoth she, adieu sweet John.

Ioh. Quoth he, I Will make thee a Lady
I prithee then dry thine eye:
There Is many a wight, is made a Knight bright
As little deserves as I.

Thus sad and heavy hearted
(their Kisses washed with tears)
These faithful Lovers parted,
no case so sad as theirs;
Before they came to the Marriage Bed,
(so woeful is this Ditty)
E're she had lost her Maidenhead,
Alack, the more's the pity.
Finis.
With Alowance.
