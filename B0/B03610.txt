The Hasty Bridegroom: OR,
The rarest sport that ha^h of late been tried,
Between a lusty Bride-grome and his Bride.
To the Tune of, Bass his Carreer: Or. Bow Bells




COme from ye Temple away to the Bed.
(...) ye Merchant transports home his treasure
Be not so coy Lady since we are wed,
it is no sin to taste of the pleasure:
Then come let us be,
Blithe merry and free;
Upon my life all the Waiters are gone:
and it is so
that they know
where you go,
say not no,
For I mean to make bold with my own.
What is it to me though our hands joined be,
if our bodies be still kept assunder.
Shall it be said, their goes a married Maid,
indeed we will have no such wonder;
Therefore let us jmbrace,
There Is non sees thy face,
The Bride-maids that waited are gone:
non can spy,
how you lie
nere deny,
but say I
For indeed jle make bold with my own.
Then come let us kiss and let us taste of that bliss
which brave Lords and Ladies enjoyed,
If all Maids should be of the humor of thee,
Generation would soon be destroyed;
Then where are those joys
The G^rls and the Boys,
Would thou live in the world all alone,
don't distroy,
but enjoy,
seem not coy,
for a toy,
For indeed jle make bold with my own.
Sweet Love do not frown, put off thy Gown,
it is a Garment unfit for the night,
Some say that black has a relishing smak,
I had rather be dealing with white:
Then be not a fraid,
For you are not betrayed,
Since we two are together alone:
I invite,
you this night,
to do right,
my delight,
Is forthwith to make bold with my own
Prithee begin don't delay but unpin,
for my humor I cannot prevent it,
You are too straight laced and your Gorget's so fast,
undo it or I straight way will rend it
Or to end all the strife,
I Will cut it with my knif,
It Is to long to stay til it is undone:
let thy wast,
be unlac'd,
and in half,
be embraced,
For I long to be bold with my own.

The second Part,
to the same Tune.




FEel here on my hand, how you make me to stand
even ready to starve in the cold;
O why should thou be, so hard-hearted to me
that loves the more dearer then Gold:
And as thou have been,
Like fair Venus the Queen,
Most complete in thy parts every ane:
let me find,
that thy mind,
is inclined
to be kind;
So that I may make with my own.
As thou art fair, and more sweet then the Air
that dallies on Julies brave Roses,
Now let me be, to that Garden a Key,
which the Flowers of Virgins incloses,
And I will not be,
Too rough unto thee,
For my nature unto mildness is prone;
do no less
but undresse
and unlace,
all a pace.
For this night jle make bold with my own.
When I have found, thee temprate and sound
thy sweet breast I will take for my Pillow
It Is great pity yt we which newly married be
should be forced to wear the green-Willow:
We shall be blessed,
And live sweetly at rest,
When we two are united in one.
with content,
and consent,
I am bent,
my intent,
Is this night to make bold with my own.

The Ladies Loving Reply. WElcome dear Love all ye powers above,
are well pleased at our happy meeting;
The heavens have decree, and ye earth is agreed
that I should embrace my own Sweeting:
At Bed and at Board
Both in Deed and in word.
My affection to thee shall shown:
thou art mine,
I am thine,
let us join,
and combine,
Jle not bar thee from what is thy own.
Our Brid-bed is made, you shall be my comrade
for to lodge in my arms all night,
Where thou shall enjoy being free from anoy
all the sport wherein Love takes delight:
Our mirth shall be crowned,
And our triump renownd:
Then Sweetheart let thy valor be shown,
take thy fill,
do thy will,
use thy skill,
welcome still
why should thou not make bold with thy own

The Bridegroom and Brid with much joy on each side
then together they to Bed both (...) go
But what they did there I did neither see nor hear,
nor I do not desire to know,
But by Cupids aid,
They being well laid,
They made sport by themselves alon:
being placed,
she unlac'd,
he uncas'd,
she embraced,
Then he stoutly made bold with his own.
Finis.
