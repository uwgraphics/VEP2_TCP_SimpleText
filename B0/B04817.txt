The Honor of Bristol.
Showing how the Angel Gabriel of Bristol, fought with three Ships, who boarded
us many times, wherein we cleared our Decks, and killed five hundred of their
Men, and wounded many more, and made them fly into Cales, where we lost bus
three men, to the Honor of the Angel Gabriel of Bristol.

To the Tune of, Our Noble King in his Progress.
Bristol





ATtend you and give ear a while,
and you shall understand,
Of a Battle fought upon the Seas,
by a ship of brave command:
The Fight it was so famous,
that all men's hearts did fill,
And make them cry to Sea,
with the Angel Gabriel.
The lusty Ship of Bristol,
sailed out adventurously,
Against the Foes of England,
their strength with them to try:
Well Victual'd, Rig'd, and manned
and good Provision still,
Which made them cry to Sea
with the Angel Gabriel.
The Captain famous Netheway,
so was he called by name,
The Masters name John Mines,
a man of noted fame:
The Gunner Thomas watson,
a man of perfect skill,
With other valiant hearts,
In the Angel Gabriel.
They waving up and down the Seas,
upon the Ocean Main;
It is not long ago, quoth they,
since England fought with Spain,
Would we with them might meet,
our minds for to fulfill,
We would play a noble bout,
with our Angel Gabriel.
THey had no sooner spoken,
but straight appeared in sight,
Three lusty Spanish Vessels,
of warlike force and might;
With bloody Resolution,
they thought our men to spill,
And how'd to make a Prize.
of our Angel Gabriel,
Then first came up their Admiral,
themselves for to advance,
In her she bore full forty eight
pieces of Ordinance:
The next that then came near us,
was their Vice Admiral,
Which Shot most furiously
at our Angel Gabriel.
Our gallant Ship had in her,
full Forty Fighting men;
With twenty pieces of Ordinance,
we played about them then:
And with Powder, Shot, and Bullets,
we did employ them still,
And thus began the Fight,
with our Angel Gabriel,
Our Captain to our Master said,
take courage Master hold,
The Master to the Seaman said,
stand fast my hearts of Gold:
The Gunner unto all the rest,
brave hearts be valiant still;
Let us fight in the defense
of our Angel Gabriel.
Then we gave them a Broadside,
which shot their Mast asunder,
And tore the Bolt-spret of their Ship,
which made the Spaniards wonder:
And caused them to try,
with voices loud and shrill,
Help, help, or else we sink
by the Angel Gabriel.
Yet desperately they Boarded us
for all our valiant shot,
Threescore of their best Fighting men
upon our Decks was got.
And then at their first entrance,
full thirty we did kill.
And thus we cleared our Decks
of the Angel Gabriel.
With that their three ships Boarded us
again with might and main,
But still our noble Englishmen,
cried out a Fig for Spain,
Though seven times they Boarded us
at last we showed our skill,
And made them feel the force
of our Angel Gabriel.
Seven hours this Fight continued,
and many brave men lay Dead,
With purple gore, and Spanish blood,
the Sea was colored red
Five hundred of their men,
we there outright did kill,
And many more were maimed
by the Angel Gabriel.
They seeing of these bloody spoils,
the rest made have a way,
For why they saw it was no boot,
any longer for to stay,
Then they fled into Cales,
and there they must lie still,
For they never more will dare to meet,
our Angel Gabriel.
We had within our English Ship.
but only three men slain,
And five men hurt, the which I hope,
will soon be well again:
At Bristol we were Landed,
and let us praise God still,
That thus has blessed our men,
and our Angel Gabriel.
Now let me not forget to speak,
of the Gift given by the Owner,
Of the Angel Gabriel.
that many years have known her,
Two hundred pounds in coin and plate
he gave with free good will.
Unto them that bravely fought,
in the Angel Gabriel.
