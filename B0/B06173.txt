THREE Alamode SONGS. OR, WIT and FANCY REVIVED.
The Ladies Delight.
1
MY lodging is one the cold ground,
And very hard is my fare:
But that which troubles me much is,
The unkindnesse of my dear?
But Still I cry come turn love,
And I Prethey love turn to me.
For thou art the lad that I longed for.
And alas what remedy.
2
I Will Crown thee with garlands of straw then,
And marry thee with a rush ring:
My frosen hopes shall thaw then,
And merrily will I sing:
O turn to me my dear love.
And I preathee love turn to me
For thy love is the thing that above can,
Procure my liberty.
3
But if thou will harden thy heart still,
And be deaf to my pitiful moan.
Then I must endure the smart still:
And tumble in straw alone.
Yet still I cry oh turn love,
Oh turn from thy cruill-ties;
For thou art the man that alone art
The cause of my miseries.
The Jovial Hector.
1
HOw happy and free is Plunder,
When we care not for Jove nor his Thunder?
Having entered a Town,
The lasses go down,
And to their O're-comers lie under
Then why should we study to love and look pale
And make long addresses to what will grow stale?
2
If her fingers be soft, long and slender,
When once we have made her to render,
She will handle a Flute
Better far than a Lute,
And make what was ha-rd to grow te-nder.
Then why should we study to love, and look pale
And make long addresses to what will grow stale?
3
When the Houses with flashes do glitter,
We can sever our sweets from the bitter,
And in that bright night
We can take our delight,
And no Dam'sel shall escape but we will hit her.
Then why should we study to love, and look pale
And make long addresses to what will grow stale?
The Loving Shepard.
1
AMarillis told her Swain,
Amarillis told her Swain
That in love he should be plain
And not think to deceive her.
Still he protested on his truth
That he would never leave her.
2
If thou do keep thy vow quoth she,
And that thou never Do leave me,
There Is never a Swain in all this plain
That ever shall come near thee
For Garlands and enbroyder'd Scrips,
For I do love thee dearly.
3
But Colin if thou change thy love
But Colin if thou change thy love
A Tygresse then I Will to thee prove
If e're thou do come near me.
Amarilis fear not that,
For I do love thee dearly.
FINIS.
