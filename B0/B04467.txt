MARDIKE: OR, The Soldiers Sonnet of his Sword.
Sung to the ORGAN.
I.
WHen first Mardike was made a Prey,
'Twas Courage that carried the Town away,
Then do not loose your valoured Prize,
By gazing on your Mistrese eyes,
But put off your Petticoat-Parley,
Potting and sotting,
And laughing, and quaffing
Canary,
Shall make good Souldjers miscarry,
And never travel for true renown;
Then turn to your Martial Mistress,
Fair Minerva the Souldjers Sister is,
Rallying, and sallying,
And lashing, and slashing
Of wounds Sir,
With turning and burning of Towns Sir,
Is a high step to a Statesmans Throne,
II.
Let bold Bellona's Brewer frown,
And his Tun shall overflow the Town;
Or give a Cobbler Sword and Fate,
And a Tinker may trappan the State,
Such fortunate Foes as these be,
Turned the Crown to a Cross at Naseby,
Father, and Mother,
And Sister, and Brother
Confounded,
And many good Families wounded
By a terrible Turn of Fate:
Such plentiful power the Sword had,
He that can kill a man,
Thunder, and plunder
Precisely,
This is the man that does wisely,
And may climb to a Chair of State.
III.
It is the Sword does order all,
Makes Peasants rise, and Princes fall;
All Syllogisms in vain are spilt,
No Logic like a Basket-hilt,
It handles 'em joint by joint, Sir,
Thrilling, and drilling,
And killing, and spilling
Profoundly,
Until the Disputers are roundly,
And have never a word to say,
Unless it be Quarter, Quarter:
Truth is confuted by a Carter,
Whipping, and stripping,
And ripping, and nipping
Evasions,
Does conquer a power of Persuasions,
Aristotle has lost the day.
IV.
The Gown and Chair cannot compare,
With the Red-coat and the Bandaleer,
The Musquer gives Saint Paul the lurch,
And beats the Cannons from the Church,
The Priests Episcopal Gown too,
And the Organ has lost his sound too,
Tan tara, tan tara,
Tan tara, tan tara
The Trumpet
Has blown away Babylons Strumpet,
And Cathedrals begin to crack:
Your Counselors are struck dumb too,
By the Parchment upon the Drum too,
Dub-a, dub-a, dub-a, dub-a,
Dub-a, dub-a, dub-a, dub-a,
An Allarum,
Each Corporal now can out-dare 'em,
Learned Littleton goes to rack.
V.
Then since the Sword so bright does shine,
Let Us leave our Wenches and our Wine,
We Will follow Mars where ere he runs,
And turn our Pots and Pipes to Guns,
The Bottles shall be the Grenades,
We will bounce about the Bravadoes,
Huffing, and puffing,
And snuffing, and cuffing
The Spaniard,
Whose Brows has been died in a Tan-yard,
Well-got Fame is a Warriors wife:
The Drawer shall be the Drummer,
We will be Colonels all next Summer,
Hiltings, and tilting,
And pointing, and joynting,
Like brave Boys,
We shall have Gold or a Grave, boys,
Here is an end of a Souldjers life.
FINIS.
