KIND LADY Or, The Loves of Stella and Adonis. A new Court song much in request.
To a new tune. Or, Heyboys up go we, the charming Nymph, or Jenny Gin.




THe night her blackest sabled wore,
all glooming were the Skies,
And glittering Stars there were no more
then those in Stella's Eyes:
When at her Fathers Gate I knocked,
where I had often been,
And shrouded only in her and mock,
The fair one let me in.
(...) Fast locked within my close embrace
she blushing lay ashamed;
Her swelling Breasts, and glowing face,
and every touch inflamed
My eager passion; I obeyed,
resolving the Fort to win,
And her fond heart was soon betrayed:
(...)



Then, then, beyond expressing,
immortal was the joy,
I knew no greater Blessing,
so happy then was I:
And she, transporter with delight,
often prayed me to come again,
And kindly vowed that every night
she would rise and let me in.
But, ah! at last she proved with Bearn,
and sighing sat, and dull;
And I, who had as much concern,
looked then just like a fooll:
Her lovely eyes with tears ran down,
repenting her rash Sin,
She sighed and cursed that fatal hour
that e're she let me in.
But who could cruelty deceive,
or from such beauty part?
I loved her so I could not leave.
the Charmer for my heart;
But wedded, and concealed the Crime;
thus all was well again,
And now she thanks the blessed time.
that e're she let me in.
Such wanton youngsters seldom prove
so true at heart as I,
But when they gain a Damsels Love,
too often away they fly:
Whilst I such Treachery abhor,
for it is a deadly sin,
And now no cause she has to grieve
that she did let me in.
Those Rosie-blushes that did stain
her Cheeks, do now grow pale,
Her heart is now rewv'd again,
sighs did with me prevail:
She grieved was, and I perplexed,
but now rejoice again,
And Stella now no more is vexed
because she let me in.
When young Adonis called to mind
the tricks of wanton youth;
He cried, my Stella she was kind:
this is the very truth.
Do, she, thou now have got the knack
a tender heart to win,
Good Lodging thou shall never lack,
for I will let thee in.
With fiery eyes he then beheld
Stella, his hearts delight;
He bowed to love he was compelled
by charms of beauty bright:
A thousand times he did, her kiss,
and then she did begin,
And said, there is no joy like this:
I Am glad I have let thee in.
