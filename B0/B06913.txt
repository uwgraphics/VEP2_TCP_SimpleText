That I may pensively
now make my will:
Guide thou my hand to write
And senses to indite,
A Ladies last goodnight.
oh pity me.
I that was nobly born
hither am sent,
Like to a wretch forlorn,
here to lament.
In this most strange exile.
Here to remain a while.
Til heaven be pleased to smile
and send for me.
My friends cannot come nigh
me in this place,
Nor bear me company.

Poor I, am left alone,
But few regard my moan,
All my delights are gone,

I had the love of all

But from my former state
I am called back.
Through destiny and fate,

That may go when they please
and when they list,
To see their Parents kind,
As nature does them bind,
Such joys I cannot find.
Ah woe is me.
All earthly helps are gone,
I will and must
Only in God alone
Put my whole trust.
O blessed Trinity,
One God and persons three,
Release my misery.

No creature on the earth,
