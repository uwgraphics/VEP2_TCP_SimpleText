The Whig Rampant: OR, EXALTATION.
Being a Pleasant New Song of 82. To a New Tune of, Hey Boys up go We.
My book you see,
Remember me:
Then the Old cause,
We will set free.


NOw now the Tories all shall stoop,
Religion and the Laws,
And Whigs of Commonwealth get up,
to Top the Good old Cause:
Tantivy-Boys shall all go down,
and Haughty Monarchy;
The Leathern-Cap shall brave the Crown
Then Hey Boys up go We.
When once that Anti-ceristian Crew
are Chrush'd and overthrown,
Well teach the Nobles how to bow,
and keep the Gentry down;
Good Manners has a bad repute,
and tends to P^ide we see,
We Will therefore cry all Breeding down,
And Hey Boys up go We.
The Name of Lords shall be a bhor'd,
for every Man's a Brother,
What Reason then in Church or State,
one Man should Rule another?
Thus having Pill'd and Plundered all,
and Levelled each Degree,
We Will make their plump young daughters fall
And Hey Boys up go We.
What though the King and Parliament,
cannot accord together,
We have good cause to be content,
this is our Sunshine Weather:
For if Good Reason should take place,
and they should both agree,
-- who'd be in a Roundheads case,
For hey then up go We.
Remember the good old Cause^





We Will down with all the Versities
where Learning is professed:
For they still practice and maintain
the Language of the Beast:
We Will exercise in every place,
and Preach beneath a Tree:
We Will make a Pulpit of a Cask,
For hey then up go we.
The VVhigs shall rule Committee-Chair,
who will such Laws invent,
As shall Exclude the Lawful Heir
by Act of Parliament:
We Will cut his Royal Highness down,
e'n shorter by the Knee:
That he shall never reach the Throne,
Then Hey Boys up go We.
We Will smite the Idol in Guild-Hal,
and then (as we were wont)
We Will cry it was a Popish-Plot,
and Swear those Rogues have don't:
His Royal Highness to un-throne,
our Interest will be:
For if he e're enjoy his own,
Then Hey Boys up go we.
Rebellion was a Thrveing Trade
on this our English Coast:
When Pauls-Church was a Stable (...)
then Troopers Ruled the Roast:
Then Loyalty was called a Crime,
in Anno Forty-Three:
A Godly Reformation time,
For Hey then up went we.
When three great Nations sweat in (...)
and many thousand slain:
The bosom of the Earth bestrew'd,
then Godliness was Gain:
But now the Days are altered since,
as College plain did see:
If we Rebel against our Prince,
to Tybh go we.ur^y
We Will break the Windows which the (...)
of Babylon has Painted,
And when their B -- s are pulled down,
Our Deacons shall be Sai^^ed:
Thus having quite Enslaved the town,
pretending to set Free,
At last the Gallows claims its own,
Then Hey Boys up go We.
FINIS.
