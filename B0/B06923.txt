Cupid's Courtesy: OR, THE Young GALLANT Foiled at his own Weapon.
He scorned Cupid and his Dart,
Until he felt a wounded Heart.
To a most pleasant Northern Tune, etc.




Through the cool shady Woods,
as I was ranging,
I heard the pretty Birds
notes sweetly changing;
Down by a Meadow side,
there runs a River,
A little Boy I espied
with Bow and Quiver:
Little Boy tell me why
thou art here diving?
Art thou some Runaway,
and have no biding?
I am no Runaway,
Venus my Mother,
She gave me leave to play,
when I came hither.
Little Boy go with me,
and be my Servant,
I will take care to see
for thy preferment.
If I with thee should go,
Venus would chide me,
And take away my Bow,
and never abide me.
Little Boy let me know,
what is thy name termed,
That thou do wear a Bow,
and go so armed?
You may perceive the same,
with often changing,
Cupid it is my name,
I live by ^anging.
If Cupid be thy name,
that shoots at Rovers,
I have heard of thy fame,
by wounded Lovers.
Should any ^anguish that
are set on fire,
By such a naked Brat
I much admire.
If thou do but the least,
at my Laws grumble,
I Will pierce thy stubborn breast.
and make thee humble:
If I with golden Dart
would thee but surely,
There Is no Physitian's Art,
that ever can cure thee.
Little Boy with thy Bow,
why do thou threaten;
It is not long ago,
since thou was beaten;
Thy wanton Mother fair,
Venus will chide thee;
When all thy Arrows are gone,
thou may go hide thee.
Of powerful Shafts you see,
I am well stored.
Which makes my Deity
so much adored:
With one poor Arrow now
I Will make thee shiver,
And bend unto my Bow,
and fear my Quiver.
Dear little Cupid be
courteous and kindly,
I know thou can not hit,
but shootest blindly.
Although thou call'st me blind,
surely i will hit thee,
That thou shall quickly find,
i will not forget thee.
Then little Cupid caught.
his Bow so nimble,
And shot a fatal Shaft
which made him tremble.
Go tell thy Mistress dear,
thou can discover,
What all the Passions are
of a dying Lover.
And now his gallant heart
sorely was bleeding*
And felt the greatest smart
from Love proceeding:
He did her help implore,
whom he affected;
But found that more and more
him she rejected.
For Cupid, with his Craft,
quickly had chosen,
And with a leaden Shaft,
her heart had frozen;
Which caused this Lover more
sadly to languish,
And Cupid's Aid implore
to heal his Anguish.
He humble Pardon craved
for his Offense past,
And vowed himself a Slave
and to Love steadfast;
His Prayers so ardent were,
whilst his heart panted,
That Cupid lent an ear,
and his suit granted.
For by his present Plaint,
he was regarded,
And his adored Saint
his love rewarded:
And now they live in Joy,
sweetly embracing,
And left the little Boy
in this Woods chasing.
