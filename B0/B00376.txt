A Lover forsaken, Of his best Beloved.
To an excellent new Court Tune.




Joy to the person of my Love
Although that she does me disdain,
Fixed are my thoughts,
And cannot remove:
But yet I love in vain.
Shall I lose the sight.
Of my joy and hearts delight,
Or shall I cease my suit;
Shall I strive to touch;
Oh no, that were too much,
She is forbidden fruit.
Ah woe is me,
That ever I did see
The beauty that did me bewitch,
But now alas I must forgo
The treasure I esteemd so much.
Oh whither shall my sad heart go;
Or whither shall I fly;
Sad echo shall resound my plaint
Or else alack I needs must dye.
Shall I by her live,
That no life to me will give,
But deadly wounds my heart;
If I fly away,
O will she not cry stay,
My sorrow to convert;
Oh, no, no, no,
She will not do so,
But comfortless I must be gone:
But ere I go,
To friend or foe,
I Will love her, or I will love none.
A thousand good fortunes fall to her share
Although she has forsaken me,
and filled my sad heart full of despair,
Yet ever will I constant be,
For she is the Dame.
My tongue shall ever name,
For branch of modesty.
Chaste in heart and mind,
Oh were she half so kind,
Then would she pity me.
Oh turn again,
Be kind as thou art fair,
And let me in thy bosom dwell,
So shall I gain
The treasure of Loue^s paino,
Till then, my dearest Love, farewell.
FINIS.
