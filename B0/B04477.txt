The SEAMANs Folly In Marrying One so quickly; and for which he has Cause to
Repent at leisure.
Tune of, Cloris awake.
Written by Joseph Martin.






THere was a stout Seaman
as I understand,
That lately came Sailing
into fair England,
And for to be merry
it was his intent
And now you shall hear
he has cause to repent.
His Mess-Mates and he
did together agree
To go to the Tavern
some pastime to see,
Where he met with a lass
that so pleased his mind
That he vowed unto her
he would be loving and kind.
This maid being willing
together they went.
Where some howrs in pleasure
together they spent,
But at last all the Cream
of the jest will appear
When this couple in private
together was there.
He kindly embraced her
and thus to her said
I greatly do fear
that thou will dye a maid;
Now I am resolved
what ever betide
If thou art but willing
to make thee my Bride.




I Will leave all the Seas
the Rocks and the storms
And kindly embrace thee
all night in my arms,
Then pray thee sweet heart
be thou not so coy
For soon thou shall see
I will get thee a boy,
The Maids Answer. For to marry kind sir
I am loath to begin,
For all sorts of Charges
comes tumbling in,
Yet I am resolved
what ever betide
I Will have a stout Seaman
to lie by my side.
A Seaman I love him
as dear as my life
And I am resolved to be
a Seamans wife:
Then why should I stay
now I am in my prime
For we will be married
now it is high time.

The Seamans answer. The young man at this
began to rejoice
To think he had met with
(...)
They straightway was married
the truth for to say,
But she made him a Cuckold
the very next day.
He presently finding
his wife's policy,
He then was resolved
a trick for to try
And strait did disguise himself
as some people say
He picked her up walking
in Ratcliff high way.
To the Tavern they went
where full merry they were
But she little mistrusted
her husband was there,
Come lets drink a health
without any delay
My Cuckold at home
all the reckoning shall pay.
Her husband at this
in a passion strait fell
And with a good stick
he lamfatted her well,
So taking his leave
he bid England adieu
Since one has proov'd false
he did think had been true.
