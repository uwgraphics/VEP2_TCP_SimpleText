Wish upon Wish,
or Dangerfields Lamentation.
Being a true relation, of a Discovery of all the Rogueries of Captain
Dangerfield, who now is Close Prisoner in his Majestys Gaol of Newgate, for
acting the D. of M. in several Countries in England.

To the Tune of, The Old Man's Wish.
Was I once again out,
I would never come here,
Nor never transgress
Against King with a sear:
And all Rogueries shun,
With a Curse to my fate,
And never more concern
With Church or with State.
May I govern my self
By an absolute sway,
And grow wiser and better,
Before I go away,
Ambition and Faction
I swear shall decay,
Ambition and Faction
I swear -- shall decay
A wooden Cravat
I believe I shall wear,
And after a Rope
Will come to my share.
But I Will turn obedient
To Prince and to State,
And never again shams
From malice create.
May I govern, etc.
If Tyburn I miss
I will grow more wise,
And to the three Nations
Be fully precize,
And will do all
The good that I can,
And will turn from a Knave
To a true Loyal man.
May I govern, etc.
Would my sins were accquitted,
And liberty given,
I Would forsake all Fanatics,
And thank my good Heaven.
But now it is too late,
My Roguery's known,
In vain I do prate
Now in Prison I Am thrown.
May I govern, etc.
O curse on their guilt
That made me to swear
Against honest men,
That alive I wish were:
I Would govern my hate
With a pleasant new look,
And my malice abate,
And not swear on a Book.
May I govern etc.
To take a man's life,
Wrongfully away,
It is a bad act,
For to swear wrong, I say:
But a Curse me attend
That did swear to a lie,
But now I am in hold,
And afraid I shall dye.
May I govern, etc.
I wish I were dead,
I should suffer no more,
But now at the last
I must pay a long score.
The Popish Plot is in Newgate,
O there he is laid,
There, or at Tyburn,
He must dye, he is afraid.
May I govern, etc.
But now my sufferings
Is like unto Oats,
With grief I am perplexed,
And am quite out of sorts.
No M -- th, no, no,
No more i will disguise,
The Cloak, and the Star
I Will leave off and be wise.
May I govern, etc.
