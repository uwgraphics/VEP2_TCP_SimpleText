True Lovers Victory Or the Northern couple agreed.
With Sugared words and smiling looks
He did so charm her senses,
That she did yield unto his Love
For all her late pretenses.
To a rare Northern Tune, or Jennyscog wheel.


A Boney blithe Lady
in the North Country,
Whom Cupid had Wounded
most craftily
He met with his Love
and he told her his mind,
And thus he did greet her
with words so kind,
Come sit thee down by me
my own sweet joy
Thou will quite kill me
Ff thou prove coy
Should thou prove coy
and not love me,
Where shall I find
such a one as thee.
I have been at Wakes
and I have been at Fairs,
Yet never could I meet one
that with thee compares:
Far have I traveled
yet never could find;
One I loved like thee
if thou prove so kind.
Thou shall have a
gay Gown of the best,
With gay fine Buskins
thy feet shall be dressed:
With Chaplets of Roses
thy head shall be crowned.
And thy pinckt Petticoat
shall be lac't round.
WHen thou art dressed in
thy Robes so gay,
Thou shall be s^en like
the Queen of May:
The boney young Lasses
that lives by thee,
Shall all take delight
in thy company.
We will go early
to the brook side,
And catch Fishes
as they do glide
Every little Fish
thy Prisoner shall be
Thou shall catch them
and i will catch thee.
The Birds in the Grove
shall come at thy beck,
And from thy Lilly white
hands they shall peck:
And whilst with their Notes
about thee they play,
I will sing thee
a Roundelay.
Now let me kiss
thy cherry lips fair,
And praise all thy Features
that are so rare:
Thy forehead is high
and lofty does rise,
Thy sweet Ruby lips
and thy pretty black Eyes.
I Will lie by thee
all the cold night,
Thou'st want nothing
for thy delight,
Thou shall have anything
thou shall have me
Surely I have something
that will please thee.
She hearing her Lover
Thus kindly complain
From making him answer
she c^uld not refrain,
She gave him her hand
with a low courtesy:
And thus she replied
I Will have none but thee.
Thy bonny fair face
And thy words so sweet,
Did conquer my heart
When we first did meet.
There Is never a Lad
In the Nor^h Country
Shall ever have my favor
but only thee.
Then let us gang to the Kirk
now with speed.
For why I think long
till we do the deed,
Since I may have any thing
I will have thee
Because thou have something
that will please me.
