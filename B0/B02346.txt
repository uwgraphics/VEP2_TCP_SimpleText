A CONGRATULATORY POEM Upon the Happy Nuptials of the Right Honorable CHARLES
HOPE of Hopetoun, And the Very Virtuous LADY HENRIETTA JOHNSTON Daughter to the
Right Honorable the Earl of ANNANDALE, Which was Solemnized on the 31st. of
August, 1699.
IN Autumn when Seges decores the Fields,
And Phoebus all plentiful Desires yields.
These Creatures who did formerly bewail
Their hard Estate, sing now in Annandale,
There Is Hope that Heavens will crown the year with good
And Hoptoun blessed with all manner of Food.
Whilst Sun and Moon endure, so that there may
Never be Want of Hope that Grace decay.
For it is by Hope, That Love and Charity
Are still upheld, without it both do dye.
May Hoptoun flourish still with Lady Hen-
Rietta, and have a Stock of good Children.
That through all Ages, there may never fail
The Memory of Hope and Annandale.
Whose Noble Fame does add to Hopton's Honor,
He being by good Fate bestowed upon Her.
Who like to Flora in Spring of the Year,
Sends forth a Fragrant Smell both far and near,
To the Solace of all that See or Hear.
Of these choice Virtues wherewith her tender Breast
Is richly endu'd wherein true Hope does rest,
And full Assurance may always obtain
Of human Pleasure, Beauty pure and clean.
Her Noble Predecessors ever have
Proved in all Ages Pious, Wise and Grave,
And famous in such actions as might tend
Their Countrey's Good, and Interest to defend.
So, all who know the Bridegroom and the Bride,
Hope they will prove in time (if Good betide)
Which is the hearty Prayer of Muses, when
They are encouraged Virtue's Praise to pen.
But if they find their Labor quite neglected,
To pray or praise they cease, being dejected.
Yet still there is Hope they may revive again,
And not always improve their time in vain.
FINIS.
