A PROCLAMATION, For a Public General FAST, throughout the Realm of Scotland.
CHARLES, by the grace of GOD, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and sundry our good Subjects, Greeting;
Forasmuch as We, by the great injuries and provocations from the States of the
United Provinces, have been forced, for the just defense and vindication of Our
Own and Our Subjects Rights, to prepare and set out Naval Forces, and to engage
into a War upon most important reasons of Honor and Justice: And We, out of
Our religious disposition, being readily inclined to approve of an humble
motion made to Us, for commanding a general Fast to be kept throughout this Our
whole Kingdom, for imploring the blessing of Almighty GOD upon Our Councils and
Forces employed in this expedition; Have thought fit, by this Our Proclamation,
to indict a general and public Fast and day of Humiliation, for the end
foresaid. Our Will is herefore, and We straightly Command and Charge, that the
said Fast be religiously and solemnly kept throughout this Our whole Kingdom,
by all Our Subjects and People within the same, upon the first Wednesday of
June, being the seventh day thereof: Requiring hereby the Reverend Archbishops
and Bishops, to give notice hereof to the Ministers in their respective
Diocesses, that upon the Lord's Day immediately preceding the said seventh day
of June, they cause read this Our Proclamation from the Pulpit in every Paroch
Church; and that they exhort all Our loving Subjects to a sober and devout
performance of the said Fasting and Humiliation, as they tender the favor of
Almighty GOD, the duty they owe to Us, and the peace and preservation of their
Country; Certifying all those who shall contemn or neglect such a religious and
necessary work, they shall be proceeded against, and punished as contemners of
Our Authority, and persons disaffected to the Honor and Safety of their
Country.

Given at Edinburgh, the third day of May, 1665. and of Our Reign the
seventeenth year.
