of, hear and determine the Claims, Rights and Cities of all persons of the Irish
Nation that are transplantable into the Province of Connaught and County of
Clare, as in and by the said Commission is set forth; and also for the hearing
and determining of all and singular the crimes, Offenses and Misdemeanors of
any the persons so making such Claims, by them done or committed on the 23 of
October 1641 or since; and Sir Charles Coot Knight and Baronet Lord President of
Connaught, and other the Commissioners now sitting at Loughrea, formerly
appointed for the ordering, disposing and putting all such persons
transplantable, as abovesaid, into the possession of Lands in Connaught and
Clare as do justly belong unto them, are thereby also required to assign, set
out and allot unto such persons (so transplantable as abovesaid) and their
Assigns, such part and portion of Lands in Connaught and Clare as do justly
belong unto them according to their respective Articles, or according to the
respective Qualifications they shall respectively be adjudged and sentenced to
fall under, and to be comprehended in; Which said Commission was to be of force
until the first day of July now next ensuing, and no longer without other or
farther Order.

And whereas notwithstanding the said powers and authorities given, to the ends
abovesaid; and the many Declarations formerly published for the transplanting
of the said persons into Connaught and Clare; and the several provisions made
for accommodations of such as should yield obedience thereto: Yet nevertheless
there is not that conformity and obedience yielded as ought to be, but very
many persons transplantable, being Irish Papists that are Proprietors of Lands
in Ireland; or that have, since the 21 of October 1641, been in arms against
the Commonwealth of England their Armies and Forces; or that acted, aided and
assisted in the late bloody Rebellion, at or before the 21 of October 1642, do
still remain in the Provinces of Leinster, Munster and Ulster, not having any
License or Dispensation so to do.

The Lord Deputy and Council taking the premises into consideration; and the
great charge the Commonwealth is now at in maintaining the several Courts and
Officers thereto belonging, now sitting at Athlone and Loughrea by virtue of
the Commissions aforesaid, and for the ends abovesaid; and the little fruit
that is reaped thereby through the neglect of the persons abovesaid, for whose
benefits the said Courts were erected; The said Lord Deputy and Council do now
Order and Declare, and it is hereby Ordered and Declared, That the said
Commission, bearing date the 28 of December last, be continued to be of force,
and the Commissioners therein named are to execute the same until the 20 day
of September now next ensuing, and no longer.

And it is farther Ordered, That all persons transplantable (as abovesaid) who
have any right to any Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments by virtue of any
Articles, or by virtue of the Act of settlement, entitled, An Act for the
Settling of Ireland, made and passed in August 1652, or that do expect any
mercy and favor by virtue of the said Act; or that do or shall claim any Lands
in the Province of Connaught or County of Clare by virtue of the farther
Instructions from the Council of State, bearing date the second of July 1653:

are hereby required to enter their Claims of their respective Rights, Titles
and Interests to any Lands. Tenements or Hereditaments before the said John
