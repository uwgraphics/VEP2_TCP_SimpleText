THE Bleeding Lovers Lamentation: OR, Fair Clorindas sorrowful Complaint for
the loss of her Unconstant Strephon.
To the Tune of, The Ring of Gold.
Licensed according to Order.



RAnging the silent shade
seeking for Pleasure,
I heard a fair young Maid
weep out of measuree:
Her curled locks the tore
and often crying,
Strephon whom I ador^
is from me flying.
Sure by some charming Saint
he is deluded,
While here in sad complaint
I lie excluded
From all the Ioys of love,
and grief lie under.
My sorrows to remove,
heart break in sunder.
O Strephon most unkind
how could you leave me.
With a tormented mind,
the which does grieve me,
Return, return again
whom I admire,
Or in tormenting pain
I shall expire.




A Alas you little know
how I lie bleeding,
These melting tears that flow
for me are pleading,
Let them some pity find,
do not destroy me;
I am to love inclined,
let me enjoy thee.
In vain this moan I make,
he will not hear me,
Although my heart should break
he will not come near me;
But Violates the Laws
of Lovers passion,
What have I done to cause
this separation.
None had my heart but he
ever in keeping,
This said immediately,
she fell a weeping,
Her hands as white as Snow,
she wrung them, crying,
Down to the shades below,
my soul is flying.
My last Farewell I Will write
and leave behind me,
Since he for ruin quite
thus has designed me,
When he the same shall read,
it may offend him;
A mournful life he will lead,
grief may attend him.
When he shall call to mind
what Vows he made me,
Seeming to love inclined
'till he betrayed me:
This may his Soul enslave
and cause his weeping,
While in the silent Grave
I shall lie sleeping.
Death ease me of the smart
which I lie under,
And let this stubborn heart
now break in sunder.
Why should I live to feel
loves flaming fire,
Which I cannot conceal,
let me expire.
Once more her melting eyes
like Fountains flowing
And with relenting Cries,
said she I Am going.
Farewell thou perjured swain
who from me parted,
Thou have a lover slain
being hard hearted.
