A SPEECH MADE TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONCERNING EPISCOPACY.

By the Lord Viscount Faulkland.

LONDON Printed for Thomas Walkely, 1641.

THE LORD FAVLKELAND HIS SPEECH TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
MASTER SPEAKER,
he is a great stranger in Israel who knows not, that this Kingdom has long
labored under many and great oppressions, both in religion and liberty, and
his acquaintance here is not great or his ingenuitie less, who does not both
know and acknowledge that a great, if not a principal cause, of both these
has been some Bishops and their adherents.

Master Speaker a little search will serve to find them to have been the
destruction of unity under pretense of uniformity to have brought in
superstition, and scandal, under the titles of reverence, and decency: to have
defiled our Church; by adorning our Churches; to have slackned the strictness
of that union which was formerly between us, and those of our religion beyond
the sea, an action as unpoliticke, as ungodly.

Master Speaker, we shall find them to have Tith'd Mint and Anice, and have
left undone the weightier works of the law, to have been less eager upon
those who damn our Church then upon those, who upon weak conscience, and
perhaps as weak reasons (the dislike of some commanded garment or some
uncommanded posture) only abstained from it. Nay it has been more dangerous
for men to go to some neighbors Parish, when they had no sermon in their
own, then to be obstinate and perpetual recusants, while masses have been
said in security; a conventicle has been a crime, and which is yet more, the
conforming to ceremonies has been more exacted then the conforming to
Christianity, and whilst men for scruples have been undone, for attempts upon
Sodomie they have only been admonished.

Master Speaker, we shall find them to have been like the henin Esop, which
laying every day an egg upon such a proportion of barley, her Mistress
increasing her proportion in hope she would increase her eggs, she grew so
fat upon that addition, that she never laid more: so though at first their
preaching were the occasion of their preferment, they after made their
preferment, the occasion of their not preaching.

Master Speaker, we shall find them to have resembled another fable, the dog
in the manger, to have neither preached themselves, nor employ those that
should, nor sufferd those that would. To have brought in catechizing only to
thrust out preaching, cried down lectures by the name of factions, either
because their industry in that duty appeared a reproof to their neglect of it
(not unlike to that we read of him, who in Nero's time and Tacitus his story
was accused, because by his virtue he did appear Exprobrare vitia Principis)
or with intention to have brought in darkness, that they might the easier sow
their tares, while it was night: and by that introduction of ignorance,
introduce the better that Religion, which accounts it the Mother of devotion.

Master Speaker in this they have abused his Majesty, as well as his people,
for when he had with great wisdom (since usually the children of darkness
are wiser in their generation then the children of light; I may guess not
without some eye upon the most politic action of the most politic Church)
silenced on both parts those opinions which have often tormented the Church and
have, and will always trouble the schools they made use of this declaration to
tie up one side, and let the other loose, where as they ought either in
discretion to have been equally restrained, or in justice to have been
equally tolerated. And it is observable, that that party to which they gave
this license was that, whose doctrine though it were not contrary to law, was
contrary to custom, and for a long while in this Kingdom was, no oftener
preached then recanted.

The truth is Master Speaker, that as some ill Ministers in our state first
took away our money from us, and after endeavored to make our money not worth
the taking, by turning it into brass by a kind of Antiphilosophers-stone: So
these men used us in the point of preaching, first depressing it to their
power, and next laboring to make it such, as the harm had not been much, if
it had been depressed, the most frequent subjects even in the most sacred
auditories, being the Jus divinum of Bishops and tithes, the sacredness of the
clergy, the sacrilege of impropriations, the demolishing of puritanisme and
propriety, the building of the prerogative at Paul's, the introduction of such
doctrines, as admitting them true, the truth would not recompense the scandal,
or of such as were so far false, that as Sir Thomas Moore says of the
casuists, their business was not to keep men from sinning but to inform them
Quam prope ad peccatum sine peccato liceat accedere, so it seemed their work
was to try how much of a Papist might be brought in without Popery, and to
destroy as much as they could of the Gospel, without bringing themselves into
danger of being destroyed by the law.

Master Speaker, to go yet further, some of them have so industriously
labored to deduce themselves from Rome, that they have given great suspicion,
that in gratitude they desire to return thither, or at least to meet it half
way, some have evidently labourd to bring, in an English, though not a Roman
popery. I mean not only the outside and dress of it, but equally absolute a
blind dependence of the people upon the clergy, and of the clergy upon
themselves, and have opposed the papacy beyond the sea, that they might settle
one beyond the water. Nay common fame is more then ordinarily false, if none of
them have found a way to reconcile the opinions of Rome, to the preferments of
England; be so absolutely directly and cordially Papist, that it is all, that
fifteen hundred pounds a year can do to keep them from confessing it.

Master Speaker I come now to speak of our liberties, and considering the
great interest these men have had in our common Master, and considering how
great a good to us they might have made that interest in him, if they would
have used it to have informed him of our general sufferings; and considering
how little of their freedom of Speech at Whitehall, might have saved us a
great deal of the use we have now of it in the Parliament house, their not
doing this alone were occasion enough for us to accuse them, as the betrayers
though not as the destroyers of our rights and liberties. Though I confess if
they had been only silent in this particular I had been silent too: But alas
they whose ancestors in the darkest times excommunicated the breakers of Magna
charta; did now by themselves and their adherents both write, preach, plot, and
act against it, by encouraging Doctor Beale, by preferring Doctor Mannering,
appearing forward for monopolies and ship-mony: and if any were slow and
backward to comply, blasting both them and their preferment, with utmost
expression of their hatred, the title of Puritans.

Master Speaker, we shall find some of them to have labourd to exclude both
all persons, and all causes of the clergy from the ordinary jurisdiction of
the temporal magistrate, and by hindering prohibitions (first by apparent power
against the Judges, and after by secret agreements with them) to have taken
away the only legal bound to their arbitrary power, and made as it were a
conquest upon the common law of the Land, which is our common inheritance, and
after made use of that power to turn their brethren out of their freeholds,
for not doing that which no law of man required of them to do, and which (in
their opinions) the law of God required of them not to do. We shall find them
in general to have encouraged all the clergy to suites; and to have brought
all suites to the Councell-table that having all power in Ecclesiastical
matters, they labored for equal power in temporal, and to dispose as well of
every office as of every benefice, and lost the clergy, much revenew and much
reverence, (whereof the last is never given when it is so asked) by encouraging
them indiscreetly to exact more of both then was due, so that indeed the gain
of their greatness extended but to a few of that order, though the envy
extended upon all.

We shall find of them to have both kindled and blown the common fire of both
nations, to have both sent and maintained that book, of which the author no
doubt has long since wished with Nero; Utinam nescissem literas, and of which
more then one Kingdom has cause to wish, that when he writ that, he had
rather burnd a library, though of the value of Ptolomie's. We shall find them
to have been the first and principal cause of the breach, I will not say of,
but since the pacification at Barwicke. We shall find them to have been the
almost sole abettors of my Lord of Strafford, whilst he was practicing upon
another Kingdom, that manner of government which he intended to settle in
this, where he committed so many, so mighty, and so manifest enormities and
oppressions as the like have not been committed by any Governor in any
government since Verres left Sicily. And after they had called him over from
being deputy of Ireland to be in a manner deputy of England, (all things
here, being governed by a Juntillo, and that Juntillo governed by him) to have
assisted him in the giving of such Counsels, and the pursuing of such courses,
as it is a hard and measuring cast, whether they were more unwise, more unjust,
or more unfortunate, and which had infallibly been our destruction if by the
grace of God their share had not been as small in the subtilty of Serpents as
in the innocence of doves.

Master Speaker, I have represented no small quantity, and no mean degree of
guilt, and truly I believe, that we shall make no little complement to those,
and no little apology for those to whom this charge belongs, if we shall lay
the faults of the men upon the order of the Bishops, upon the Episcopacy. I
wish we may distinguish between those, who have been carried away with the
stream, and those who have been the stream that carried them; between
those, whose proper and natural motion was toward our ruin and destruction,
and those who have been whirled about to it contrary to their natural motion
by the force and swinge of superior Orbs, and as I wish, we may distinguish
between the more and less guilty; so I yet more wish, we may distinguish
between the guilty and the innocent.

Master Speaker, I doubt if we consider, that if not the first Planters yet
the first Spreaders of Christianity, and the first and chief Defenders of
Christianity against heresies within and paganism without, both with their
ink and with their blood; and the maine conducers to the resurrection of
Christianity: (at least) here in the reformation (and we owe the light of the
Gospel we now enjoy to the fire they then endured for it) were all Bishops:
and that even now in the greatest perfection of that order, there are yet some
who have conduced in nothing to our late innovations, but their in silence;
some who in an unexpected and mighty place and power have expressed an equal
moderation and humility, being neither ambitious before, nor proud after,
either of the Crosiers staff or white staff: some who have been learned
opposers of Popery, and zealous opposers of Arminianisme, between whom and
their inferior clergy in frequency of preaching has been no distinction,
whose lives are untouched, not only by guilt, but by malice; scarce to be
equaled by those of any condition, or to be excelled by those in any
Calendar. I doubt not I say, but if we consider this, this consideration will
bring forth this conclusion, that Bishops may be good men, and let us give but
good men good rules, we shall have both good governors and good times.

Master Speaker, I am content to take away all those things from them, which to
any considerable degree of probability may again beget the like mischiefs, if
they be not taken away. If their temporal titles power and employment appear
likely to distract them from the care of, or make them look down with
contempt upon their Spiritual duty, and that the too great distance between
them, and those they govern will hinder the free and fit recourse of their
inferiors to them; and occasion insolence from them to their inferiors. Let
that be considered, and cared for, I am sure neither their Lordships, their
Judging of tithes wills and marriages, no, nor their voices in Parliaments are
Jure divino; and I am as sure, that these titles and this power, are not
necessary to their authority, as appears by the little they have had with us
by them, and the much that others have had without them.

If their revenew shall appear likely to produce the same effects (for it has
been anciently observed that Religio peperit divitias, and Filia devoravit
matrem;) Let so much of that, as was in all probability, intended for an
attendant upon their temporal dignities, wait upon them out of the doors.
Let us only take care to leave them such proportions, as may serve in some
good degree to the dignity of learning and the encouragement of students, and
let us not inuert that of Jeroboam, and as he made the meanest of the people
Priests, make the highest of the Priests, the meanest of the people.

If it be feared, that they will again employ some of our Laws, with a
severity beyond the intention of those Laws against some of their weaker
Brethren, that we may be sure to take away that power, let us take away
those Laws, and let no ceremonies which any number counts unlawful, and no
man counts necessary (against the rules of Policy and Saint Paul) be imposed
upon them. Let us consider that part of the rule, they have hitherto gone by,
that is such canons of their own making as are not confirmed by Parliament
have been, or no doubt shortly will be by Parliament taken away, that the
other part of the rule (such canons as were here received before the
reformation and not contrary to any law) is too doubtful to be a fit rule,
exacting an exact knowledge of the canon law, of the common law, of the statute
law knowledges, which those who are thus to govern have not, and it is scarce
fit they should have. Since therefore we are to make new rules, and shall no
doubt make those new rules, strict rules; and be infallibly certain of a
trienniall Parliament to see those rules observed as strictly as they are made,
and to increase or change them upon all occasions, we shall have no reason to
fear any innovation from their tyranny, or to doubt any defect in the
discharge of their duty. I am confident, they will not dare either ordain,
suspend, silence, excommunicate, or deprive otherwise, then we would have
them. And if this be believed, I am as confident, we shall not think it fit
to abolish upon a few days debate an order, which has lasted (as appears by
story) in most Churches these sixteen hundred years, and in all from Christ
to Calvin, or in an instant change the whole face of the Church, like the scene
of a Mask.

Master Speaker, I do not believe them to be Jure divino, nay I believe them
not to be Jure divino, but neither do I believe them to be Injuria humana. I
neither consider them as necessary, nor as unlawful, but as convenient or
inconvenient. But since all great mutations in government are dangerous, (even
where what is introduced by that mutation is such as would have been very
profitable upon a primary foundation) and since the greatest danger of
mutations is, that all the dangers and inconveniences they may bring are not to
be foreseen, and since no wise man will undergo great danger, but for great
necessity; my opinion is, that we should not root up this ancient tree as
dead as it appears, till we have tried whether by this or the like lopping of
the branches, the sap which was unable to feed the whole, may not serve to
make what is left both grow and flourish. And certainly, if we may at once
take away both the inconveniences of Bishops, and the inconvenience of no
Bishops, that is of an almost universal mutation; this course can only be
opposed by those, who love mutation for mutations sake.

Master Speaker, to be short (as I have reason to be after having been so
long,) this trial may be suddenly made, let us commit as much of the
Ministers remonstrance, as we have read, that those heads both of abuses and
grievances which are there fully collected, may be marshaled and ordered for
our debate; if upon that debate it shall appear, that those may be taken away
and yet the order stand, we shall not need to commit the London petition at
all: for the cause of it will be ended, if it shall appear, that the
abolition of the one cannot be, but by the destruction of the other, then let
us not commit the London-petition, but let us grant it.

FINIS.
