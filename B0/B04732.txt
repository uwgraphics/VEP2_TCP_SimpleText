A Pleasant new Song Betwixt a Saylor and his LOVE.
To the tune of, Dulcina.




WHat does ayle my Love so sadly
in such heavy dumps to stand;
Does she grieve or take unkindly
that I am so nigh at hand?
Or does she vow
She will not know,
Nor speak to me when I do come?
If that be so
Away I Will go.
First kiss and bid me welcome home.
Had I ever thee forsaken,
putting thee out of my mind,
Then thou might have justly spoken
that I to thee was unkind,
Or should I take
Some other Mate,
Then might thou have a cause to mourn,
But let me dye
Before that I
Do so then bid, etc.
Sooner shall the grass leave growing,
from the Hare the Hound shall run,
Husbandmen shall leave their sowing,
floods shall run the Land upon,
The Fish shall fly
The Sea run dry,
The Birds shall sing no more but mourn,
Ere I of thee
Unmindful be,
Then kiss, etc*
Smile on me be not offende^,
pardon grant for my amiss,
Let thy favor so befriend me.
as to seal it with a kiss,
To me I swear
Thou art so dear,
That for thy sake I Will fancy none,
Then do not frown,
But sit thee down,
Sweet kiss, etc.
It thou had proved chaste Diana
since from thee I did depart,
I have as constant been to thee*
for on thee fixed was my heart.
No not for she,
Jupiter see,
Diana in her Tower alone
Should me entice
No, I Will be nice,
Then kiss, etc.
No nor Venus Cupids Mother,
nor the fairest wife of Jove
Should Lucretia or some other,
seek by gifts to win my love,
Should Hellen fair
To me compare,
And unto me for love make moan,
Yet none of those
My mind shall please,
Then kiss and bid me we^come home.




FRom thy sight though I were banished,
yet I always was to thee,
Far more kind then Ulisses
to his chaste Penelope,
For why away
He once did stay,
Ten years and left her all alone,
But I from thee
Have not been three,
Sweet kiss and bid me welcome home.
Come Sweetheart and sit down by me,
and let thy lap my pillow be,
While sweet sleep my mind beguileth,
all my dreams shall be on thee,
I pray thee stay,
Steal not away,
Let Lullaby be all thy Song,
With kisses sweet
Lull me asleep,
Sweet kiss, etc.

The Woman's Answer.
I Have been sad to see how from me
thou so long from me did stay,
Yet now I more rejoice to see thee
happily arrived this way.
Thou from our shore
Shall go no more
To wander thus abroad alone,
But thou shall stay,
With me always,
And here is my hand you are welcome home,
I have proved Diana to thee
since from me thou went away,
I have Suitors well nigh twenty,
and much ado I had to stay,
But I denied
When they replied,
And sent them all away with scorn,
For I had sworn
To live forlorn,
Until that I see thee come home.
Seeing thou art home returned,
thou shall not go home in have.
But lovingly come sit down by me,
let my arms embrace thy wast.
Farewell annoy,
Welcome my joy,
Now lullaby shall be thy song,
For now my heart
Sings loath to part,
Then kiss, etc.
Since sweet heart thou do befriend me
thus to take me to thy love
Never more will I offend thee
but will ever constant prove.
Thou have my heart,
Not to depart,
But ever constant to remain,
And thou art mine
And I am thine,
Then let us kiss and Welcome home.

FINIS.
