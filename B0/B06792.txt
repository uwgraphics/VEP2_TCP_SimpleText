Your humble Servant Madam. BEING The flattering Courtier. OR, The Cheating
Lover;
To a ^ery fine Northern Tune.




I Am a Blade
That from an old Trade,
Have taken out a new one
It Is only this,
To Court and Kiss
Swear Oaths and nere a true one
I can tell an hundred lies,
And a thousand more devise,
Never was the like since Adam,
I can Fetter whom I please,
With a Flattering disease,
And your humble Servants Madame.
The Wars are done,
And I must run
A Course that may Pr^ me
Should I rely.
On Honesty,
It were the way to (...)me*
I have given away my (...)
For a Perriwigg and Muff,
And an Art no Wit can Fadom:
I have got a Place at Court,
Never paid a Penny for it,
But your humble Servant Madame.
Whilst a Cavelier
Both lean and ^ear
And almost like to Sta^d^ is
A Ladies Letter,
Shall be better
Then all his Iron Service.
When I found out what would do it
Straight I put a Lady to it,
What things I lackt I had (...),
Nothing did I give for this,
But a promise and a kiss,
With your humble Servant Madam.


MY Courtiers Place,
Does give me grace,
And Pimp unto my Trade is;
The Devil and I,
In Ambush lie
To Catch all kind of Ladies;
I can call 'um pretty Souls,
^ough they be as old as Pouls,
Then I a bonny Lad am;
(...) the Women I Trappan
Fetch 'um off and bring 'um on,
With your humble Servant Madam.
^ome give me Rings,
And better a Things,
So cunning is my carriage,
To every soul,
Both fair and fowl
I promise lawful Marriage.
I have got so many Wives,
If I had as many Lives,
I should be as old as Adam.
But before we go to Church,
I Will leave them in the lurch.
With your humble Servant Madam.
When I find a Face*
Of a stately Grace,
That would have all adore her,
A Knighthood I
Get presently
And that I spread before her:
So I may get something by it*
I can quickly be a knight;
If a Little will persuade 'um
I can tell um that they shall,
Answer to no other call
But your humble Servant Madam.
If I see one that
Is given to th^tt,
I praise her Ingenuity:
When I take a Prize
With the black Eyes,
I call her Queen of Beauty
If another merry be
I can laugh as well as she
When she asks, I monstrous sad am
But if I find her in a b^^t,
I can fit her for the foot
With your humble Servant Madam.
All Passions I,
Can falsify,
(...) my Trade is,
I have of late
Gained an Estate
My humouring of Ladies
And I very well do find,
What I fit them in their kind
For I Have ^e^u^l^d Adam
Woman first did ransom Man
But I (...) them again.
With your humble Servant Madam.
