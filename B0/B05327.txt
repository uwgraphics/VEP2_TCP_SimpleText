ACT (...) favors of the afflicted Inbabitants of the Town of KELSO, through
the ^^^e Fire for a volu^^^^r Contribution.
Edinburgh, the seventeenth day of April, 1684.
FORASMUCH as there being a Representation made to the Lo^^^ of His Majesty's
Privy Council, by the Afflicted Inhabitants within the Town of Kelso, through
the late Fire, ^ea^ing; That whereas, upon Tuesday the eighth of this Instant,
betwixt three and four a Clock in the afternoon, there happened a most
calamitous Fire, within the said Town of Kelso, which began first in a
Malt-h^^^ whereby some Neighboring Stacks of Corn were kindled, and these, by
the violent tempestuous Wind, blowing over the Town, did, in a sudden, put the
whole in so universal a Conflagration, that these who were helping their
Neighbors, did not know when their own Hou^es were Burning, in so much, that
before nine a Clock of the Night, not only all the Houses, but the most p^^t of
all the Goods therein and several Merchant Shops of considerable value, and
above four thousand Bolls of Victual, lying in Girnels, and all the Corn-^^cks
in the Town (...) ^^^rly in Ashes; during which time, the fury of the Flame,
and rage of the Smoke, ^ere so great in all (...) Town, that with great
difficulty, Sick, and Infirm Persons, and Infant-children (...) be carried away
(...) to the open Fields: By which sad Visitation, three hundred and six
Families, (...) to a (...) of the Masters Names, given in to the Lords of
Council, have had their Dwelling-houses within the said Town, (...) down; and
of this, not twenty will ever be able to Rebuild again, upon their own Means
and Expenses; and the loss of Merchants is so great, that it cannot be well
known, the particular loss of some of them, being valued above twenty thousand
Pounds Scots, and of others, above a thousand Pound Sterling; and the more
Indigent sort of People, have lost the whole Sustenance of their Liveliehood,
through the Burning, both of their Houses and Corns, so that with much
difficulty, they have been hitherto Supplied with the Charity of their
N^^^^bours, which will not serve long to Sustain them, without the Council, in
Commiseration of their necessitous Condition, shall graciously be pleased to
provide for them, a more universal and seasonable Supply. And (...)
^^^licating, That the Council would recommend them, and their desolate and
indigent Families, to the Charity of the whole Kingdom, and grant Order and
Warrant for that effect, in manner underwritten. The Lords of His Majesty's
Privy Council having considered the foresaid Petition, and being sufficiently
informed of the verity of the foresaid Representation, and of the great
Distress the poor Inhabitants of the said Burgh, are reduced to by the said
Fire* ^e Recommend (...) Distressed and Afflicted Condition, to the Charity of
all good People within the whole ^^^^dom, And recommends to the Archbishops
and Bishops, to cause Intimation be made hereof, in the several (...) Churches
of their respective Diocesses upon a Sabbath Day, or to take ^^ch course
otherwise, as may make (...) Recommendation most effectual for the Petitioners
Help and Relief; and ^ppoi^ts Mr. Robert Be^^^^ Advocat, (...) ^^e Collector of
the said Contribution, who has found sufficient Caution, ^^ted in the Books of
Privy Council, to do exact Diligence, for inbringing thereof, and to see what
shall be uplifted, bestowed in the most equal ma^^er, for the Relief of the
Inhabitants.
