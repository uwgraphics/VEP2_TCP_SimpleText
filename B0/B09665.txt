Veritas in Profundo blazon of the University of Oxford with four female
figures and mottoes
May the 11 1661.
WHEREAS great complaint has been made of diverse Undergraduates,
Priviledge-Persons, and Townsmen of Several conditions and qualities; some
whereof (contrary to that distinction and good order which ought to be
observed) do unduely intrude into the Seats belonging to the Masters of Arts
of this University at St. Mary's; others filling Such disorderly manner, that
the Vice Chancellor, and Doctors cannot without much difficulty, and
inconvenience come to their Seats. These are therefore peremptorily and
expressly to require and command all such persons for the future to forbear to
come within the said Seats or passages upon pain of being Severely censured
for their irregularity; and undergoing such further penalty as shall be thought
fit to be inflicted by the Vice Chancellor and Proctors in case they persist
therein. And the Proctors of the University are hereby desired see this Order
put in effectual Execution.

PAVL HOOD, Vi^e-Chan. Oxon.
