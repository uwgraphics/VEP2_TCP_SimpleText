A Pleasant Ballad of Tobias, wherein is showed what wonderful things chanced
to him in his Youth, and how he wedded a young Damsel that had had several
Husbands, but never enjoyed their Company, being all slain by an evil Spirit.
To a pleasant New tune.




IN Ninivie old Toby dwelt,
an aged man, and blind was he,
And much affliction he had felt,
which brought him unto misery:
He had by Anna, his true wife,
one only Son, and eke no more,
Which was the comfort of his life,
and he by him did set great store.
He brought him up so virtuously
in true obedience, and in awe,
And every day he did apply,
to fear the Lord and keep his law:
Upon a time it came to pass,
he called his Son to him with speed,
And thus to him these words did frame:
My Son (quoth. he) thou know my need,
Thou must unto Gabael go,
to Roguels house in Media Land:
For I did lend him long ago
ten Talents on his only band.
My Father ( dear Tobias said)
at your command strait will I go,
How shall I get the money paid?
seeing the man I never did know.
Take then the writings here with thee,
which is sufficient to be seen;
And get a guide to go with then;
since thou the way have never been.
A Guide Tobias soon had got,
An Angel in the shape of man,
Which thing he did not know God wot,
the Lord had so appointed then.
Tobias with his blessed Guide,
went on his journey thus with speed,
Until they came to Tigris side,
at the fair Flood they did abide:
Tobias he did go wash him there,
by reason of the Summers heat,
A mighty Fish put him to fear,
which leapt out of the waters deep.
Cut up the fish, the Angel said,
and keep the liver, heart, and gall,
to do the same be not afraid,
great cures there shall be done withal,
When this was done away thry went,
and coming near their journeys end,
We'll lodge to night, the Angel said,
with Raguel thy Father's friend,
He has a Daughter fair of face,
and also of a virtuous life,
And when we come unto that place,
I Will speak that she may he thy wife:
Why Azarius (then quoth he,
for so they did the angel call)
I wis she is no wife for me,
swift death does all her Lovers fall.
Seven Men to her have married been,
which in her love did take delight:
When her bedchamber they had seen,
they had not lived half the night.
A wicked Spirit loves her so,
he will not suffer any man
With her into the bed to go,
but works his death do what they can.
The Angel said, Good Courage take,
for so it shall not he with thee,
For such perfumes I will thee make,
the wicked Spirit away shall flee.
To Raguels home away they run,
where Sarah met them fair and bright,
And after Salutations done,
she brought them to her Fathers sight.


GReat cheer there was, and down they sat
and all for young Tobias sake,
And after long and pleasant chat,
between them two a match they make,
By Moses law they married were,
the brides bed chamber prepared like wise,
When young Tobias came in there,
the tears fell down from Sarahs eyes.
A Pan of Coals he brought with him,
the Fishes heart and liver there;
Within the fire he did cast in,
which cast a savor every where:
And by that sweet and pleasant smell
the wicked Spirit was displaced,
Within that room he could not dwell,
but out he went in haste.
In bed they laid the beauteous Bride,
the Chamber Door was shut therefore;
Young Toby lying by her side,
whom he did think to see no more,
And therefore Raguel in the night
for him before had made a Grave:
And to his wife he went and said,
there is no means his life to save.
One of the Maidens send, quoth he,
to see how all the matters stands,
And if so be that dead he be
he shall be buried by my hands.
This Maiden joyful news did bring,
Tobias is alive (quoth she)
When Raguel heard of this thing,
he did rejoice exceedingly.
For joy he made a solemn feast,
the bridal fourteen days they kept,
There came many a friendly Guest,
in sorrow now no more they slept.
Azarius went straight way,
unto the feast Gabael brought;
Rejoicing at his marriage day,
and paid the money that he ought.
But yet old Toby and his wife,
did all this while in sorrow dwell,
They thought their Son had lost his life,
and nothing could their grief expel,
His aged mother every day
did watch the Highway side,
And for his welfare often did pray.
no meat nor drink she could abide.
But when the wedding ended was,
young Toby with his lovely bride,
To Ninivie did homewards pass,
with Goods and Chattels on each side,
But Toby and his angel bright
before his wife made haste to go:
For to prepare all things aright,
his lovely bride to welcome ho.
His mother watching in the way,
full soon espied her tender Son:
Rejoicing at that happy day,
she told her Husband he was come:
Whereat old Toby tumbled out,
for he was blind and could not see,
Young Toby with the Fishes Gall,
rubbed both his eyes immediately.
Whereat the whiteness of his eyes
incontinent did fall out quite:
So that before he did arise,
he had again his perfect sight:
Great joy there was and down they sat,
young Toby told his Father all:
Who went to meet his lovely bride,
with joy and mirth that was not small.
