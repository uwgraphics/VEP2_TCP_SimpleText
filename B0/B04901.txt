The POPES Pedigree:
Or, the twineing of a Wheelband, showing the rise and first Pedigrees of
Mortals inhabiting beneath the Moon* Being a most pleasant and new Song.

The like whereof you never heard,
But now shall plainly understand.

A Beggar got a Beadle,

A Yeoman got a Prentice
a Prentice got a Freeman,
A Freeman got a Master,
a Master got a Lass,
On her was got a Gentleman
a Justice of the Peace.
So twined the Wheelband,

The like whereof you never heard
the twineing of the Wheelband
The Justice he was rich
and noble in desire,
He married with a Lady,
and so begat a Squire,
The Squire got a Knight
who is Country quire forsook,
To travel into France
and there begat a Duke.

The Duke begat a Prince,
the Prince a King of hope,
The King begat the Emperor,

The Pope begat a Friar,
the Friar begot the Nun,
And so you may hear
how their Pedigrees begun,
It Is a well twined wheelband,
the like whereof you never heard,
But now shall plainly understand,
the twineing of this wheelband.
The Nun she chanced to slumber,
and laying bare her Rump,
The ball'd pate Friar bob'd her,
and so begat a Monk.
The Monk begat a Daughter
who could both lie and huff,
She married to a Barrister,
and quickly got a Ruff.
So twin's etc,
The Ruff it took good counsel,
good counsel got a Fee,
The Fee begot a Serjant,
thus runs the Pedigree.
The Serjant got a triple cap
which a good Lawyer spoiled,
By getting ease and Gout,
he once more got a child.
So twin's etc.
A Dog he got a Bailiff,
who Cerbrus like could roar,
And daily hunt a bout the Town
to terrify the poor,
The Bailiff got a Turnkey,
the Turnkey got a Jailer,
Who hell-hound like do suck the blood
of those the Bums do hail there.
So twines etc.
The Jailer got an under Sheriff,
the under got an upper,
Who can fright a Country town
by shaking of his crupper,
He married to a Virgin
that was of some renown,
And plying on her briskly
begot a Scarlet Gown,
So twined etc.
The Gown is got a Merchant
who sending Ships to Sea,
By bringing over uncustom'd Goods,
grew rich immediately,
He strideing of a Boat Swains wife,
Woe became a Captain
by sighting very hot,
So twined etc.
The Captain got a Colonel,
the Colonel he was tall,
And by leaping trenches
became a General
The General was eager
in pursuit of fame,
And in a little space
begat a dreadful name,
So twined etc.
And thus may you see now
how are since Adams time
The Pedigrees ran round
as the Wheelband did twine,
From the lowest to the highest
and then back again,
In continual motion
this Wheelband does remain,
So merrily twined the wheelband
the well twined wheelband,
By this you may plainly understand
the twineing of this wheelband.
