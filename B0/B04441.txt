The Male and Female Husband;
OR, A Strange and Wonderful Relation how a Midwife living at St. Albans, being
brought to Bed of an Hermophrodite, brought it up in Woman's Apparel, and
carried it with her as her Deputy to be assisting at the Labors of several
Women, going under the Name of Mary Iewit: And how at last a discovery of it
was made by its Lying with a maid, and getting her with-Child, whom the said
Hermophrodite was thereupon obliged to marry: With a particular account of the
Trades and Employments it was put to during its Minority. With several pleasant
passages that happened.

To the Tune of, What shall I do, shall I dye for Love, etc.




COme listen all unto my Song,
for why it is most true;
The like whereof you seldom heard,
or yet but rarely knew:
A Midwife in St. Albans lives,
whose name I shall not cite:
For some Years past, she is brought to Bed
of an Hermophrodite.
Which she in Female habit dressed,
that it might not be known;
And so for many Years none knew
but it that Sex did own:
For why as it grew up in Years,
it with her often did go
To women's labors, that her skill
she might (...) it show
And let it often with women lie,
who knew not that it bore
Of either Sex a signal mark,
and had each thing in store:
And often with Maids it used to be,
but long time did refrain
From the kind feats of Venus sport,
for fear they should complain.
A Females name indeed it had,
and Mary Jewit called,
And so for many Years was thought,
e're it could be inthrall'd:
But at the last being lusty grown,
when as the Mother went
To lay a Woman, with the Maid
in Bed some nights it spent.




And it is Male-instruments so used,
the wrench proved great with-child,
When being taxed who got the same,
she blushed, and answered mild,
The feigned Female that did come
with Mother-Midnight, why
Because he had Male-parts as well
as Female 'twixt the Thighs.
And that it being lusty grown,
surpised her in her sleep,
She nothing dreaming of the thing,
it 'twixt her Legs did creep:
Which on a sudden wakeing, she
shrieks and Starts with fear;
But all in vain, for it was fast
locked in her Virgin-geer.
And after that some other Nights
they did both sport and play;
The wench being familiar grown,
said not the Monster nay;
But in short time she is big with-child
by this both-Sexed thing;
For which some folks strait her before
a Justice then did bring.
And there she set the Story forth,
which made some women smile,
To think how with a double-Sex
Dame Midnight did beguile:
Whilst others blushed to think how it
Natures great Business saw:
Which to the Female-sex alone,
is common by their Law.
Nor would they be at all convinced,
until a search was made:
For why the supposed Lass did learn,
long-time a Sempsters Trade:
But the good women having searched
did find each Member good:
And that Rogero 'bove the Cleft,
most firm and stoutly stood.
When on their words the Justice then
did bid them both agree:
for since the wench was got with child
they both must married be,
To which our Hermophrodite
did give his free, consent:
And changing habit for a man,
he to the Church straight went.
Having since learned the Gentle-craft
though Craft he had before,
And could the feats of either Sex
perform and keep in store.
But now to London they are come,
as many does suspect:
There to set up a wicked Trade,
and Modesty neglect.
FINIS.
