THE Two Faithful Lovers.
To the Tune of, Franklin is fled away, etc.




Man.] Farewell my heart's delight,
Ladies adieu,
I must now take my flight,
what ever ensue;
My Countrymen I see,
They cannot yet agree;
Since 'twill no better be,
England farewell.

Maid.] O be not so unkind,
heart, love and joy,
To leave me here behind,
breeds my annoy:
O have a patient heart,
I Will help to bear the smart,
Ever I from thee will part,
my turtle dove.

M.] I Will leave thee gold good store,
thee to maintain;
What can thou wish for more?
do not complain:
Servants shall wait on thee,
I Will give thee jewels three,
That thou may think on me
when I am gone.

M.] Your gold I count but dross,
when you are fled,
Your absence is my loss,
'twill strike me dead;
Servants I will have none,
When you are from me gone,
I Would rather lie alone,
from company.

M.] I am resolved to go,
fortnue to prove;
Advise me what to do,
my dearest love:
For here I will not 'bide,
What ever does me betide;
Heavens now be my guide,
and lead the way.

M.] Then let me go with you,
heart, love and joy;
I will attend on you,
and be your boy:
If you will go to sea,
I Will serve you night and day,
For here I will not stay,
if you go hence.



M.] The seas are dangerous,
strangers unkind,
The rocks are perilous,
so is the wind:
My care is all for thee,
As thou may plainly see,
Dear heart go not with me,
but stay behind.

M.] Though seas do threaten death,
my heart's delight,
With thee I Will spend my breath,
naught shall affright:
With thee I Will live and dye,
In thy sweet company,
Though dangers shall be nigh,
both day and night.

In man's apparel now
to sea she went,
Because with him she would be,
her heart's content;
She cut her lovely hair,
And no mistrust there were,
That she a maiden fair
was at that time.
To Venice they were bound
with full consent,
With sorrows compast round
away they went:
On an unhappy day
The ship was cast away,
Which wrought their lives decay,
friends discontent.
The ship being cast away,
fortune so frowned,
He swam to land that day,
but she was drowned:
Oh! his true love was drowned,
And never after found,
And he encompast round
with grief and care.
O cruel seas (quoth he)
and rocks unkind,
To part my dear and me,
in love combined:
O cast her on this shore,
I may her death implore,
And mourn for evermore
until I dye.
You loyal lovers all
that hear this ditty,
Sigh and lament my fall,
let us move you to pity:
She lies now in the deep,
In everlasting sleep,
And left me here to weep
in great distress.

Dear love, I come, quath he,
heaven's me guide,
I long to be with thee
my only bride:

In Venice he did dye,
And there his corpse does lie,
And left his friends to cry,
O Hone. O Hone.
