A PROCLAMATION, Against Conventicles.
CHARLES, by the grace of GOD King of great Britain, France and Ireland,
defender of the Faith,
To (...) Macers, or Messengers at arms, our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly
and severallie, specially constitute Greiting,
Forasmuch as by several Laws and Acts of Parliament, and specially by the
fifth Act of the second Session of this current Parliament, all unwarrantable
meetings and Conventicles either in houses or in the fields, upon pretense of
Religion and religious exercises, are prohibited and discharged, under certain
great pains and penalties: which Act hitherto has not received that obedience
which was due thereunto; In regard the Lords of Our Privy Council, the
Sheriffs of Shires, and other Judges to whom the execution thereof is
committed, have not had that information from the Heritors, in whose bounds
these Conventicles were kept, and others; which was necessary, that the
persons guilty might be proceeded against according to Law: And seeing we are
fully resolved to use all possible means for making the said Act effectual,
being of great concernment to Religion, and the peace of this Church and
Kingdom: And it being the duty of all our good Subjects not only to give
obedience to Our Laws, by their own peaceable and orderly deportment; But
likewise in these places where they have power and interest, to use their
endeavoures for preventing and suppressing such unwarrantable and disorderly
practices, as Conventicles are, being so far contrair to Law, and destructive
of the public peace: And in order thereto, to give timous notice of any such
Meetings kept within their bounds when the same comes to their knowledge. OUR
Will is herefore, and We charge you straightly and command, that in continent
these Our Letters seen, ye pass, and in Our Name and Authority command and
charge all Heritors, Liferenters and propper Wodsetters of Lands in this
Kingdom to be careful, that no house or field Conventicle, upon pret^u^e of,
or for Religious exercise or worship, be kept within the bounds of the
respective Lands belonging to them: and in case any shall be kept in any part
of their Lands, so soon as they shall have notice thereof, that they immediately
give information of the same, of the persons present thereat, and other
circumstances thereof sua far as consists in their knowledge, to one of Our
Privy Counselors, or to the Sheriff of the Shire, Stewart of the Stewartrie,
Lord or Baillie of the Regality or Royalty, or their Deputes within whose
jurisdiction the Lands or Houses, where the Conventicle was kept, do ly
certifying such Heritors, and others foresaids, who shall know of any
Conventicles kept upon any part of their Lands, or in any Houses thereintill,
and shall not discover the same, and what they know thereof, to the Sheriffs
and other Magistrates aforesaids, or their Deputes, within the space of three
days after the same comes to their knowledge, that they shall be fined for
each Conventicle, not delated by them, in the fourt part of the yearly valued
rent of the whole Lands belonging to them in Heritage, Liferent or propper
Wodset, within the Shire where the Conventicle shall be kept, and we do
hereby strictly require the Sheriffs of Sheriffdomes, Stewarts of Stewartries,
Lords and Baillies of Regalities or Royalties and their Deputes, upon delation
made of Conventicles by the Heritors, or information given by any other persons
thereanent, to proceed to the trial thereof, and to put the foresaid Act of
Parliament to due and vigorous execution. And We do hereby Authorize and
require the Sheriffs and other Magistrates foresaids and their Deputes, to call
before them such Heritors, Liferenters and propper Wodseters, who shall know of
any Conventicles kept in their Lands, and shall not discover the same, within
the space foresaid, and (their knowledge thereof being proven, either by their
own oaths, or other Legal probation,) to inflict upon them the foresaid fine,
whereof one third part, to be applied for the use of the said Judges; another
third part to the person who shall give information concerning these Heritors,
and a third part thereof to be uplifted for Our use: And it is hereby declared,
that if the said Sheriffs and other Judges foresaids, and their Deputes shall
be remiss and negligent in performance of their duty in the premises, they
shall be called before Our Privy Council, and severely punished. And it is
hereby declared, that as for any Conventicles that shall happen to be kept
within Burghs Royal, the Magistrates of the Burghs shall be liable to such
fynes for every such Conventicle as Our Council shall think fit to impose, and
that the Master or Mistress of the house where the Conventicle shall be kept,
and the persons present thereat, shall relieve the Magistrates, as Our Council
shall order the same, conform to the foresaid fifth Act of the second Session
of this present Parliament, entitled, Act against Conventicles: And We ordain
these presents to be Printed and published at the Market Cross of Edinburgh,
and at the Market Crosses of the head Burghs, of the several Shires, and that
likewise the Shireffs and other Magistrates foresaids, and their Deputes cause
intimate the same at the several Paroch Churches within their respective
Jurisdictions, that none pretend ignorance: The which to do we commit to you
conjunctly and severally Our full power, be their Our letters, delivering them
be you duly execute and indorsat again to the Bearer.

Given under Our Signet at EDINBVRGH, the second day of April, and of Our
Reign the twenty fifth Year, 1673. Al. Gibson, Cl. Sti Concilij.

GOD save the KING.
