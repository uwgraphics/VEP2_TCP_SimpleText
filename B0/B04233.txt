Loves Tyranny: OR, Death more welcome then Disdain.
Being the Tragedy of Leander for the Love of Roxane.
Lovers beware, for in Loves Smiles the fates,
To Ruin two Adventurous Mortals waits;
Women like Sirens, first with Charms allure,
Until they Wound, then leave us without Cure:
Such fate Leander founds, and for disdain,
Took Death's kind portion, which expelled his pain:
To the Tune of, Let the Critticks Adore, etc.






AH! how drousie's the Skies,
Now black Night does arise
From the Ocean;
And all the bright Fires,
Seem void of desires,
And of motion:
While my flames I do discover,
love charges my Breast,
Oh the Nymph there does hover,
that is my portion of Rest:
They Are creating a Desire,
and such hopes of a Bliss,
As my thoughts do inspire,
^ She does leave me confined,
And as swift as the Wind,
she does fly me;
Whilst here all alone,
I do breath my sad moan,
she does try me:
Melted in feavors of Passion,
like a Phoenix I Am fried,
So beyond alteration,
my fierce Torments abide:
And I straight am made Fuel,
to the Beams of her eyes,
Till each moment she grows cruel,
and my Flame does despise
The second Part,
to the same Tune.
WHile the beauteous fair,
Does wound with despair,
I must perish,
Unless her bright face,
Will yield my Love place,
for to Cherish:
Oh! her Angel-bright beauty,
does so Charm with Delight,
That I think it my Duty,
through the shaddows of night:
For to follow her flying,
I, and sadly complain,
And implore her, still sighing,
for to ease my great pain.
And when Purple morning,
The Skies is adorning,
each Meander,
Of the wide Grove,
I importune for Love,
and do wander:
While as Echo replies,
with a doleful harsh sound,
Thy Roxane she now flies,
which like death's shafts wound:
So that still she is Creating
a Composser of Fate,
Which surpasses the relating
the wonders so great.
Oh I fear some one sips,
From her fair Corral Lips,
the sweet Necture,
While I sigh here in vain,
And to Woods do complain,
I neglect her:
Once more i will arise,
from my mournful cold Bed,
Though with Charms that surprise,
she does strike me for dead:
I Will press on to those pleasures,
though I perish in Love,
Oh! those sacred Treasures,
do so powerful prove.
I Will no longer despair,
Thus tormented with care,
and sad Fancies,
But clasped in her Arms,
There i will perish with Charms,
and with Glances:
Oh it is better to be Dying,
then continually grieve,
Or at least for to be trying,
she perhaps may relieve
This so woeful disaster,
that Love has now wrought,
Or to drive an fate faster,
while to moan I am taught.
Or before it is too late,
I Will revive my sad state,
e're I slumber,
And in Death's cold shade,
For Ages am laid,
without number:
But O what now appears,
from yon Cypress Grove,
How revived are my fears,
it is the Queen of my Love:
Ah! where fleets thou my joy,
what a vision was this,
So soon gone, to destroy
my short fancy of Bliss.
Oh! make room in the shades,
Lovers Ghosts for life fades,
and is flying;
Oh! i will not always hear,
This Eternal despair,
to be dying:
Then he drew his keen sword,
and cried thus with a wound,
I Will a Cure now afford,
that Appollone'r found:
Oh! then into that Breast,
which Death could never fright,
The fatal steel pressed,
and his soul took flight.
