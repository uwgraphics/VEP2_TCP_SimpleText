JENNY's Lamentation For the loss of her JEMMY.
She wandered up and down for Love,
Till she was weary grown,
Then sat down in a shady Grove,
and thus she made her moan.
Tune of, Jenny Gin, or Busy Fame.




A Woe's me! poor harmless Maid,
my hopes are quite undone,
For J^mmy he is from me fled,
who onst I thought my own:
Alas! he is gone for evermore
from her who loved him well,
Who will his memory adore,
whilst upon Earth I dwell.


Ah! cruel Swain, that thou should prove
so perjured to thy Love,
To make her wander in this Grove,
like to the Turtle Dove,
Who losing of her Mate, does pine,
and moan it self to death;
So I shall murmr to the wind
as long as I have breath.




Could thou so faithless prove to one
that gave to thee her heart;
Remember but the Oaths thou'st sworn
that we should never part:
You kissed my hand, and squez'd it hard,
and swore and vowed that I
Should ever you of love debar,
immediately you dye.
But Jemmy when you hear I Am gone,
and that for you I died,
Your conquest then will soon be done
when once your Charms are tried:
I Will pray to Cupid, though he is blind,
that he will shute his dart,
And make thee love one that is unkind
and so to break thy heart.
I wish the times I saw thee first
had been my Burial day,
Then I had never had cause to cursed,
nor any one to say:
Ah! Jenny, thou that onst was thought
the glory of the Plain,
Was by a faithless Shepherd caught,
and by his falsehood slain.
But farewell cruel perjured Swain,
for evermore adieu;
Unto the gods I will complain
how faithless and untrue,
How much like them that he was made,
in every part divine;
Yet has his Shepherdess betrayed,
and does his vows decline.
Be witness gods I had no faul^
except I loved too well,
My heart never thought of a revoult,
and that my eyes can tell:
Let all young maids by me be warned,
and keep entire their Love,
For fear when onst their hearts are charmed
they wander in this Grove.
She had no sooner said this word
but down the Damzel fell,
And said, good-by my dearest Lord,
in whom all beauties dwell:
Then fetching of a dreadful groan,
unto the winds she spoke,
Bear these my last words to my Love;
and then her heart strings broke.
Printed for P. Brooksby at the Golden Ball in west Smithfield.
