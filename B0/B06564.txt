The Subtle Damosel.
Or, Good Counsel for Maids.
Wherein she shows to every Maiden fair,
To take heed of false young men wherever they are:
For Frummety Dick does love well the Kettle,
And porrige pot Will is a man of great mettle.
To the Tune of, the new made Gentlewoman,




I Once had a Servant,
as other Maids have
That pretented to love me
but he proved a knave:
He thought by his tricks
to overcome me,
But I was as cunning
and crafty as he.
His tongue was so tipped
with temptations that I
Out of his presence or sight
could not lie;
He called me his honey,
his duck and his dear:
But now his words to me
he does them forswear,
But now I am free from him,
I Am glad in my heart:
Its never be said, I will mourn
When we part:
But unto all Maids now
the truth I will show
To take heed of false young men
wherever they go.
In The first place take heed,
and beware what I say*
For when you are bound,
they will force you to obey:
Nere trust a man
that has a red Nose,
Before he will want his liquor
he will pawn your best clothes:
There Is Dick came and Harry:
both Robin and Will
Have showed themselves clowns,
and so they will be still:
For Peter at dancing
he put them all down
But John kissed the best of all
men in the Town.
But though I did promise him
and count him the best
Yet he can dissemble
as well as the rest:
From eighteen to thirty
these young men I mind
Loves a wench in a corner,
if they can them find.
For this I Am resolved,
and so I say still,
There Is not one amongst twenty
but he both prove ill:
Search every City
and Town you shall not see
A man that proves constant
and faithful to be
Though John of good mettle,
and counted so civil,
At a Frumme^y Kettle
he will fight with the Devil:
Or at long spoon and custard
he is a right honest man:
But I have forsook him
then love him who can.
There Is Bob a good fellow
to give him his due:
Such a young man again
I think there is but few:
Yet with one disease he is
troubled I smell,
If he meet with a wench,
he cannot kiss her but tell.
Also came the Tailor
and the Weaver I discern,
The one is for Shreds,
the others for Yarn:
These two boon Companion^
work hard I do see,
And they are striving which of them
the best thief will be,
Last Valentines day
I met with my Dear,
He took me by the hand,
and lead me to the Fair:
He gave me fine fairings,
to kiss me was bold:
But at last I do give him
the dog for to hold,
His eloquent speeches
could do him no good,
I can give him fair words,
and then leave in the mud:
He talked of deep learning,
but I did him tell
That he went to school
in some bottomless well.
The world now adays
it is come to that pass,
That every Boy now
does look for a Lass:
There Is Bacon-fac'd Harry
as short as my thumb,
All arse and no body, Sing
come pudding come.
These young men and more of them
which I could name,
To wrong pretty Maidens
they think it no shame.
But what should we speak on it?
it often has been tried,
That honest young men
they cannot abide.
Thus Maids have I told you
some part of my mind,
How it is very heard a good
Husband to find.
Though my Love has left me,
to grieve I never shall:
If the rest prove no better,
old Nick take them all
