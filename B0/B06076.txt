ACT Concerning the DECLARATION To be signed by all persons in public Trust.
At Edinburgh, the fifth day of September, one thousand six hundred and sixty
two.
FOrasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God, in His Majesty's Restitution to His
Royal Government, to restore this Kingdom to its ancient liberties and peace,
and to deliver His Majesty's good Subjects from these miseries and bondage
whereby they have been oppressed, during these troubles; And the Estates of
Parliament, finding themselves obliged in a due resentment of this mercy, and
in discharge of that duty they owe to God, to the Kings Majesty, to the public
peace of the Kingdom, and the good of His Subjects, To use all means for the
due preservation of that peace and happiness they now enjoy under His Royal
Government; and to prevent and suppress every thing that may tend to the
renewing or favoring of these courses, by which the late Rebellion has been
fomented and carried on; And conceiving, that the employing of persons of found
principles and entire loyalty, in all offices of Trust and places of public
Administration, will conduce much to these ends. Therefore, and for quieting
the spirits of His Majesty's good Subjects, and begetting a confidence in them
of their security for the future, His Majesty has thought fit, with advice and
consent of His Estates of Parliament, to Statute, Ordian and Enact; Likeas His
Majesty, by these presents, does, with advice foresaid, Statute, Ordain and
Enact, That all such persons as shall hereafter be called or admitted to any
public Trust or Office, under His Majesty's Government within this Kingdom;
that is to say, to be Officers of State, Members of Parliament, Privy
Counselors, Lords of Session, Commissioners in Exchequer, Members of the
College of Justice, Sheriffs, Stewarts or Commissaries, their Deputes and
Clerks, Magistrates and Council of Borroughs, Justices of Peace and their
Clerks, or any other public Charge, Office and Trust within this Kingdom;
shall at and before their admission to the exercise of such Places or Offices,
publicly, in face of the respective Courts they relate to, subscribe the
Declaration underwritten: And that they shall have no right to their said
Offices or Benefits thereof, until they subscribe the same as said is; but
that every such person who shall offer to enter and exerce any such Office,
before he subscribe the Declaration, is to be repute and punished as an usurper
of His Majesty's Authority, and the place to be disposed to another. Likeas His
Majesty does, with advice foresaid, remit to His Commissioner, to take such
course as he shall think fit, how these who are presently in office, may
subscribe the said Declaration. And it is hereby Declared, that this Act is
without prejudice of any former Acts, for taking the Oath of Alleagiance, and
asserting the Royal Prerogative.

I (...) Do sincerely affirm and declare, that I judge it unlawful to
Subjects, upon pretense of Reformation or other pretense whatsoever, to enter
into Leagues and Covenants, or to take up Arms against the King or these
commissionated by Him: And that all these Gatherings, Convocations, Petitions,
Protestations, and erecting and keeping of Council-tables, that were used in
the beginning, and for carrying on, of the late troubles, were unlawful and
seditious. And particularly, that these Oaths, whereof the one was commonly
called The National Covenant, (as it was sworn and explained in the year, one
thousand six hundred and thirty eight, and thereafter) and the other entitled,
A Solemn League and Covenant, were, and are, in themselves, unlawful Oaths,
and were taken by, and imposed upon, the Subjects of this Kingdom, against the
fundamental Laws and Liberties of the same. And that there lies no obligation
upon me, or any of the Subjects, from the said Oaths, or either of them, to
endeavor any change or alteration of the Government, either in Church or
State, as it is now established by the Laws of the Kingdom.
