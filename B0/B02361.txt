A Constant wife and a kind wife,
A loving wife and a fine wife,
Which gives content unto man's life.

To the tune of Locks and Bolts do hinder




YOng-men and Maids lend me your aids
to speak of my dear sweeting.
It shows how fortune has betrayed,
and often spoiled our meeting.
She likely was for to be rich,
and I a man but meanly,
Wherefore her friedns at me do grudge,
and use me most unkindly.
Her constancy I will declare,
wherein she proved Loyal,
But few that will with her compare,
when they are put to Trial.
Her frinds against her did contend,
because she lent me favor,
They said I quickly all would spend,
if that I might but have her.
They did convey her from my sight,
because she should exempt me,
I could not find my hearts delight,
which sore did discontent me.
I traveled over craggy Rocks.
over Mountains Hills and Vallyes,
But she was kept from me with locks
only through spite and malice.
But love that conquers Kings and Queens
herein did show us favor,
I brought to pass and wrought the means
in what place I could have her.
She had an Uncle did detain,
and keep her person from me,
Which I had very like to have slain,
because he did so wrong me.
I bouldly came where she did dwell,
and asked for my sweeting,
They said of her they could not tell,
which was to me sad greeting.
But presently she heard my voice,
and called me at her winder,
O I would come to thee my love,
but doors and locks do hinder,
Whereat amazed I did stand,
to hear her make that answer,
I drew my sword into my hand,
as straight the house did enter,
And then I made the locks to fly,
and doors in pieces shatter,
I vowed to have her company,
and quickly I came at her.
Her Uncle and some of his men,
did after presant follow,
Who said I nere should out again,
but in my blood should wallow.
But with some hurt done on both sides,
I got my sweet heart from them,
Young men to get your selves such brides
fight for to overcome them.
Then joined we hand's in Hymen's bands,
to love and live together,
She loved me not for house or Lands,
for I had none of either,
Her love was pure and does endure,
and so shall mine forever,
Till death do us so much enjure,
as part us from each other.


With hind and veart I will impart
the praise of my dear sweeting,
Now welcome joys and ^ace well smart,
blessed be the time of meeting.
With my sweetheart and only dear,
in whom is all my pleasure,
The like of her does not appear,
she is so blessed a creature.
O happy is that time and hour,
that e're I saw thy feature
Sure heavens bliss o^ me did shower,
to send me such a creature.
She is so pleasing to my eye,
the like was never any,
She Is virtuous wise and very kind,
she far surpasses many.
Her comely feature may compare,
with any in Town or City.
For courtesy she is most rare,
likewise she is full of pity.
No V^^^tue that can give consent,
in all that hear her praises.
But God to her the same has lent,
whereby her glory raises.
Her golden locks like threads of gold,
her eyes like stars do glister.
Her cheeks the Rose and Lillyes fold,
she may be Venus sister.
She has a dimple in her chin.
her neck shines like the crystal,
The like has seldom times been seen,
she seems so celestial.
Her arms and shoulders are complete,
her breast like Alablaster,
Her wast and middle is so neat,
there is none that e're surpast her.
Her Eloquence gives such content,
in all that hear her p^ases,
That freely they will give their consent,
to yield her earthly praises.
Her Lilly hands are at command,
to do me any service.
And quickly she will understand,
a matter what so ere it is.
If I bid go, she will not stay,
to work me a displeasure,
But presently she goes away,
and is not this a treasure.
Her parts below I Will not descry,
for they are very neat ones.
A dainty foot, a leg and Thigh,
as can be made of flesh and bones.
She is so perfect in her parts,
that many were inflamed,
On her they wholly set their hearts,
and at her fully aimed.
Thus to conclude and end my Song,
I wish well to the Feamale,
Or else I should do them much wrong,
and prove my self a Tell-tale,
Youngmen adieu prove not untrue,
unto your only sweeting.
Observe your time you need not rue,
nor curse the time of meeting.
