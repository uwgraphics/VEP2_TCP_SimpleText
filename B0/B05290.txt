ACT and INTIMATION Anent this Current Parliament.
Edinburgh, June 14. 1694.
THe Lords of Their Majesty's Privy Council Considering, that Where the present
Current Parliament, was by Their Majesty's last Proclamation thereanent
Adjourned to the fifteenth of June Instant; And that His Majesty being now
Abroad forth of His Kingdoms, has not as yet Signified His Pleasure, either by
sending a Commissioner for holding thereof at the said Day, nor His Royal Order
for Adjourning the same to a further Day; And Seeing That both by the Nature of
the High Court of Parliament, and by Express Acts of Parliament, Parliaments
are Current without the necessity of an Express Continuation until they be
Disolved by Their Majesty's Express Warrant whose Sole Prerogative it is, to
Disolve, as well as to Call, Hold, and Prorogue the Same; Therefore the said
Lords of Their Majesty's Privy Council in Expectation of Their Majesty's
Express Orders, and to prevent the Unnecessary Trouble of the Members and other
Good Subjects, who may be Concerned to Repair to the Meeting of Parliament:
Have thought fit to Ordain Intimation to be made, that all Members of
Parliament be ready to Meet and Attend in this present Current Parliament, so
soon as Their Majesty's Will and Pleasure shall be Signified to them for that
Effect; and that none may Pretend Ignorance, Ordains these Presents to be
Printed, and to be Published at the Market Cross of Edinburgh, by the Lion King
at Arms and his Brethren Heralds and Pursevants, and at the whole Market
Crosses of the remnant Head-Burghs of the several Shires within this Kingdom by
Macers or Messengers. Exracted by me
