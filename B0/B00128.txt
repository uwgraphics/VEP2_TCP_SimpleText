A merry new Iigge. Or, the pleasant wooing betwixt Kit and Pegge.
To the tune of Strawberry leaves make Maidens fair.




M. WEll met fair Maid,
my chiefest joy.

W. Alas blind fool,
deceived art thou.

M. I prithee sweet Peg
be not so coy.

W. I scorn to fancy
such a Cow.

M. Thy beauty sweet Peg,
has won my heart.

W. For shame leave off
thy flattery.

M. From thee I never
mean to part.

W. Good lack how thou
can cog and lie!

M. For Peggies love
poor Kit will dye.

W. In faith what color
then shall it be?

M. In time my constant
heart will try.

W. Then pluck it out,
that I may see.

M. My life I will spend
to do thee good:

W. Alas good sir,
that shall not need.

M. For thee I will
not spare my blood.

W. God send your Goslings
well to speed.

M. Yet feign would I be
thy wedded mate.

W. Alas good sir I am
already sped.

M. What luck had I
to come so late?

W. Because thou broughtst
a calfe from ^ed.

M. O pity me,
sweet Peg I thee pray.

W. So I have done
long time God wo^.

M. Why do thou then
my love denay?

W. Because I see
thou art a sot.

Now here does follow a pleasant new Song Between two young Lovers that lasted
not long. OR, The second part,
To the same tune.


M. WHy Ich have wealth
and treasure store.

W. And wit as small,
as small may be.

M. A chain of Gold
I might have worn.

W. A Cocks-combe fitter had
it been for thee.

M. Thou lo^'st the Miller
of the Glen.

W. What if I do,
what is that to thee?

M. I will bang the Millers
love from him.
And therefore wend,
and gang with me.

W. Great boast small roast
such brags will make:
But if Tom Miller
he were nie,
He would bang thee well
for Peggies sake,
And like a Puppy
make thee cry.

M. Yet kiss me now
for my good will,
And if any life
thou meanst to save.

W. To give a kiss,
I think it best,
To rid me from
a prating knave.
Be packing hence
you Rusticke clown.

M. No haste but good
I hope there be.

W. Take heed lest that
I crack your crown
For bussing Pegge
so sawcily.

M. Nay in friendly sort
now let us part,
I pray thee sweet Love
so let it be.

W. Adue kind Kit
with all my heart,
I am glad I am rid
of the company.

M. All you young men
take Heed by me,
That unto women
set your mind.
See that your Lovers
constant be,
Lest you be served
in like kind.
