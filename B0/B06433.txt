The Valiant Seamans Congratulation to his sacred Majesty King Charles the
second.
With their wonderful Heroical Achievements, and their Fidelity, Loyalty,
and Obedience.
To the Tune of Let us drink and sing, and merrily troul the bowl. Or, The
stormy winds do blow. Or, Hey Ho, my Heny.


GReat Ch^rles, your English Seamen
upon our bended knee,
Present our selves as Freemen,
unto Your Majesty.
Beseeching God to bless you
wherever that you go,
So we pray, night and day,
when the stormy winds do blow.
In darkest nights, or Shipwracks,
always we are on our guard:
Of French or Turkish Pirate,
we never were afraid.
But called stout English Seamen
wherever that we go.
For we make, them to quake
when the stormy winds do blow.
We are your Valiant Seamen
that brought you out of Spain:
And will as warlike Freemen
your Royal Cause maintain.
If you will give Commission
to wars with France we will go:
Then shall we, merry be,
when, etc.
'Twas we did sail you over
to English ground again:
And landed you at Dover,
with all your Noble men,
For which we are renowned
wherever we do go:
Honor will, tend us still,
when, etc.
And now we are a ranging
upon the Ocean Seas,
The Frenchmen they are changing
and cannot be at ease,
For we will make their top-sailes
unto our Fleet shall bow:
Then shall we, merry be,
when the stormy winds do blow.


The second Part
to the same Tune.
SOmetimes our tacklings breaking
our Masts we cut in two:
Our ships are often leaking,
great straits we are put unto.
In great tempestuous weather,
which few at home does know
Thus do we, live at Sea,
when the stormy winds do blow.
When some at home are feeding
and cheering up themselves
Then we at Sea are bleeding
amongst the rocks and shelves
Yet greater dangers ready,
still we will undergo.
For our King, and will sing
when, etc.
Sometimes when we are sailing
our Victuals they grow scarce
Our wives at home bewailing
and pitying of our case.
In thinking of the dangers
poor S^a-men undergo.
For our King, still we sing,
when the, etc.
Yet we are still courageous
with any foe to fight:
If Turk or Jew engage us
we put them to the flight.
And make them give us homage
before we let them go:
For our King, then we sing
when, etc.
We are the prop of Trading,
what kind so ere it be:
The original of Lading
your Ships with treasury.
None goes beyond a Seaman
in riches, gold, and store:
For he brings, wealth to Kings
when, etc.
We have some sneezing powder,
the Dutchman fain would have,
'Twill make him speak the louder,
if Kings he will not have.
And cause him to remember
the physic taking so:
Then shall we, merry be,
when, etc.
Great King we will make you famous,
your glory shall outshine
Romulus and Remus,
Godolph or Constantine.
We Will bring you gold and treasu^^
by sailing to fro:
And will fight, day and night,
to preserve you from your foe.
FINIS.
