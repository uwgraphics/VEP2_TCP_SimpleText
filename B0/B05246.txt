EDINBVRGH, 29. Junii, 1650.
THE Estates of Parliament now presently conveened in this fifth Session of this
second Triennall Parliament, Taking to their consideration, the great abuses
daily committed by the running away of soldiers from their standing Troops or
Regiments, wherein they are engaged, which daily occurres, and through want of
condign punishment, is become too ordinary; For remedy whereof, The said
Estates of Par^iament have ordained, and ordaines, That if any soldier shall
run away from the present standing Troops or Regiments, whereunto they are
engaged, and have undertaken, that they shall be punished with death. And for
that effect, The Estates of Parliament gives and grants full Power to every
Regiment within themselves respective^y, To call a counsel of War for
punishing of the said Runawayes accordingly, and because many of the foot
soldiers are in use to run away from their Collors, and to take on with others
to be horsemen; Therefore the said Estates of Parl. have discharged, and by
their presents, discharges all Shyres and Officers to take on any of the
standing foot soldiers who are already engaged in any Regiment or Company,
with certification, that if any such who were formerly engaged in service shall
be found in the Regiments or Troops, the Out-putter, or Taker on of them
(without sufficient testimonials from Ministers, Kirk-Sessions, or from the
Elders of these places where they live, and abide, that they are freemen)
shall be obliged to furnish two men in their places, either to the Troop or
Regiment where they shall be found; with power likewise to any of the officers
in the Regiments, from which they are runawayes to sease upon them, and bring
them back to the said Regiments to be punished as aforesaid, and to make use
of their horse and arms (if horsemen) and of their Pikes and Muskets (if
footmen) for supply of their own Regiments and Companies, as they shall think
fitting; And ordains these presents to be intimate publicly at the Market
Cross of Edinburgh, and in all the several Shyres, and to all the Troops of
horse, and Regiments of foot in the Army, and to be printed for that effect.
