True LOVE without DECEIT;
Poor Strephon sadly does lament
'Cause Phillis is unkind,
Yet vows that she shall never see,
In him a change of Mind.
To the Tune of, over Hills and High Mountains.


UNfortunate Strephon
Well may thou complain
Since thy cruel Phillis
Thy Suit does disdain
But let her persist
In her fierce Tyranny
Yet I will be faithful
To her till I dye.
Through Woods and through Deserts
I Will privately walk
And there of my Phillis
I Will mournfully talk,
where the pretty sweet Birds
With my moan shall comply
For I will be faithful,
To her and,
Ah Phillis Remember
That thou art unkind
Ah Phillis remember
Thou art still in my mind,
Ah Phillis remember
My true Constancy,
For I will,
To the,
But mind for thy sake
How the World I do range,
And though thou art cruel
Yet I will not change,
For thou like an Angel
Do seem in mine eye
And I will,
To thee,


Sometimes in a Dream
I slumbring do lie,
And then my dear Phillis
Appears to mine Eye,
And straight all my Senses
Away from me fly,
And I vow to be.
To her etc.
But when I awake and
Do find 'twas a Dream,
Just like one distracted,
I presently seem,
And cry that a hapless
Poor Lover am I.
Yet vow,
To thee etc.
What can thou propose
To thy self for to gain,
By keeping thy Lover
Fast locked in a Chain?
Or why do thou send me
Such Darts from thine Eye
Who Vow,
To thee etc.
No Prayers nor Tears
With thee can prevail
Till Death by Commission
Takes me to his Iayl,
For whilst I do live
This shall be my cry,
That I will be
To, etc,
Since nothing can move thee.
I still must despair,
Since thou will not love me
It adds to my Care
Since I for thy sake still
In Fetters must lie
Yet I will,
To thee etc.
Thus Strephon continued
His Making complaint
But he wanting breath then
Began for to Faint
And with the last Breath
That ere from him did fly
Still said he would be faithful
Until he did dye.
