The DYERS Destin^ OR, The Loving Wife's Help in time of Need.
Two Trades is better far than one,
sweet Husband, then, said she;
Then if thou will let me alone,
I Will be a help to thee.
To the Tune of, Why are my Eyes still flowing, etc.
This may be Printed, R. P







A Dyers Wife she was a dainty curious Do,
But with her Friend she a Gadding would go,
Alas he could not keep his handsome wife at home,
For with her Gallant a broad she would roam,
And when she came to her husband each night,
Then like two Tigers together they would fight,
And at each blow she would often reply,
Thou art a Cuckold and so thou shall dye.
You know full well I take the greatest care of all,
Or else your substance would soon be but small,
For why should I depend upon your Trade alone,
Is not two Callings far better than one;
Therefore i would have thee be contented still,
For I protest I will have my own will,
It Is but a folly the same to deny,
Thou art a Cuckold and so thou shallt dye.
Huswife, said he, and have you now the wanton pl^
So that your husband is a Cuckold made,
What flash and blood is able for to bear with this?
You shall, quoth she, though you take it amiss:
For I declare it so nothing but true.
Which I have oftentimes hinted to you,
Nay I do hate to be found in a lie.
thou art a Cuckold and so thou shall dye.
A Shoemaker I own to be my chiefest friend,
There does the most of my hopes still depend,
Against we meet he is a Man that does provide,
Not only Money, but something beside:
Therefore you have no great cause to complain,
Because to you I still bring home the gain,
As for your Anger, I still do d^fie,
Being a Cuckold and so thou shall dye.
The Dyer then, alas was in a cruel rage,
That nothing scarce could his Anger assuage,
Do not I bring to you my Wages every week,
What need have you any Gallants to seek;
At this his Wife she was straight in a huff,
Saying your Wages is not half enough,
Therefore be patient, said she, do not cry,
For you are a Cuckold and so thou shall dye.
It is well known our Clothes were all at pawn of
And we reduced to a very mean state,
But now you see we make a very handsome shift,
Thus I was forced to help at a dead lift;
I brought home Coin by my industry,
The which I gave you all pawns to set free,
The truth of this sure you cannot deny,
As you are a Cuckold, and so you shall dye.
Praynow did you e're flourish so in all your Life,
As row you do by the help of your Wife,
Therefore my Crime you may very well here excuse,
Tell me I pray, do you ever want Shoes?
Yet know you not the price of those you wear,
I get them by my industrious care,
The truth of this sure you cannot deny,
As you are a Cuckold and so you shall dye.
A Countryman of mine you sent me with one day,
Who in Apparel was gallant and gay,
To me he gave a Golden Guinea and no less,
But yet for what I will leave you to guess:
But for your comfort take this by the way,
You shall big Gravel the next Horn-Fair day,
Basket and Pit-Axe I reckon to buy,
For you are a Cuckold, and so you shall dye,
Printed for I. Blare, at the Looking-Glass on London Bridge.
