A true Relation of one Susan Higges, dwelling in Risborrow a Town in
Buckinghamshire, and how she lived 20. years, by robbing on the Highways,
yet unsuspected of all that knew her; till at last, coming to Messeldon, there
robbing a woman; which woman knew her and called her by her name: now when she
saw she was betrayed, she killed her, and standing by her while she gave three
groans, she spat three drops of blood in her face, which never could be washed
out; by which she was known and executed for the aforesaid murder at the
Assizes in Lent at Brickhill.

To the tune of, The worthy London Prentice.


TO mourn for my offenses,
and former passed sins,
This sad and doleful story,
my heavy heart begins:
Most wickedly I spent my time,
devoid of godly grace:
A lewder woman never lived,
I think in any place.
Near Buckingham I dwelled,
and Susan Higges by name,
Well thought of by good Gentlemen,
and Farmers of good fame:
Where thus, for twenty years at least,
I lived in gallant sort:
Which made the Country marvel much,
to hear of my report.
My state was not maintained,
(as you shall understand)
By good and honest dealings,
nor labor of my hand:
But by deceit and coozening shifts,
the end whereof, we see
Has ever been repaid with shame,
and ever like to be.
My servants were young country girls,
brought up unto my mind,
By nature fair and beautiful,
and of a gentle kind:
Who with their sweet entising eyes,
did many Youngsters move
To come by night unto my house,
in hope of further love.
But still at their close meetings,
(as I the plot had laid)
I stepped in still at unawares,
while they the wantons played,
And would in question bring their names,
except they did agree
To give me money for this wrong,
done to my house and me.
This was but petty coozenage,
to things that I have done:
My weapon by the highway side,
has me much money won:
In men's attire I often have rode,
upon a Gelding stout,
And done great robberies valiantly,
the Countries round about.
I had my Scarfes and Vizords,
my face for to disguise:
Sometimes a beard upon my chin,
to blind the peoples eyes:
My Turkey Blade, and Pistols good,
my courage to maintain:
Thus took I many a Farmers purse,
well crammed with golden gain.
Great store of London Merchants,
I boldly have bid stand,
And showed my self most bravely,
a Woman of my hand:
You ruffling Roysters every one,
in my defense say then,
We women still for gallant minds,
may well compare with men.
The second part,
To the same tune.


But if so be it chanced,
the Countries were beset,
With hue, and cries, and warrants,
into my house I get:
And I so being with my Maids,
would cloak the matter so,
That no man could by any means,
the right offender know.
Yet God that still most justly,
does punish every vice,
Did bring unto confusion
my fortunes in a trice:
For by a murder all my sins
were strangely brought to light,
And such desert I had by law,
as Justice claim^d by right.
Upon the Heath of Misseldon,
I met a woman there,
And robbed her, as from Market,
home wards she did repair,
Which woman called me by my name,
and said that she me knew;
For which even with her lives dear blood,
my hands I did imbrew.
But after I had wounded,
this woman unto death,
And that her bleeding body,
was almost reft of breath,
She gave a groan, and therewithal,
did spit upon my face,
Three drops of blood, that never could
he wiped from that place.
For after I returned
unto my house again.
The more that I it washed,
it more appeared plain:
Each hour I thought that beasts and birds,
this murder would reveal,
Or that the air so vile a deed,
no longer would conceal.
So heavy at my conscience,
this woeful murder lay,
That I was soon enforced,
the same for to bewray,
And to my servants made it known,
as God appointed me:
For blood can never secret rest,
nor long unpunisht be.
My servants to the Justices,
declared what I had said;
For which I was attached,
and to the Iayle conveyed,
And at the Sises was condemned,
and had my just desert:
Even such a death let all them have
that bear so false a heart.
So fare well earthly pleasure,
my quaintance all adue,
With whom I spent the treasure,
which causes me to rue.
Leave off your wanton pastimes,
lascivious and ill,
Which without Gods great mercy,
does soul and body kill.
Be warned by this story,
you ruffling Roysters all:
The higher that you climb in sin,
the greater is your fall:
And since the world so wicked is,
let all desire grace,
Grant Lord that I the last may be,
that runs such a race.
FINIS.
