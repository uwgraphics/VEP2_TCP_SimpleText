The Spanish Tragedy, Containing the lamentable Murders of Horatio and
Bellimperia: With the pi^tifull Death of old Hieronimo.
To the tune of Queen Dido.
Alas it is my son Horatio.


Murder, help Hieronimo


Stop there mouth




YOu that have lost you former joys,
And now in woe your lives do lead:
Feeding on naught but dire annoyes,
Thinking your griefs all griefs exceed.
Assure your selves it is not so:
Lo here a sight of greater woe.
Hapless Hieromino was my name,
On whom fond fortune smtied long:
But now her flattering smiles and blame,
Her flattering smiles has done me wrong.
Would I had dyed in tender years:
Then had not been this cause of tears.
I Marshall was in prime of years,
And won great honor in the field:
Until that age with si^uered hairs,
My aged head had ouerspred
Then left I war and stayde at home:
And gave my honor to my son.
Horatio my sweet only child,
Prickt-foorth by fames aspiring wings:
Did so behave him in the field,
That he Prince Baltazer Captive brings.
And with great honor did present:
Him to the King Incontinent.
The Duke of Castyles Daughter then.
Desired Horatio to relate:
The death of her beloved friend,
Her love Andreas woofull fate.
But when she knew who had him slain:
She vowed she would revenge the same.
Then more to vex Prince Baltazer,
Because be slew her chiefest friend:
She chose my son for her chief flower,
Thereby meaning to work revenge.
But mark what then did straight befall:
To turn my sweet to bitter gall.
Lorenzo then to find the cause,
Why coat his sister was unkind:
At last he found within a pause,
How he might sound her secret mind.
Which or to bring well to effect;
To fetch her man he does direct.
Who being come into his sight,
H^ threatens for to rid his life:
Excep^ straight ways he should recite,
His sisters love, the cause of strife.
Compelled therefore to unfold his mind:
Said with Horatio she is combinde.
The Villain then for hope of gain,
Did straight conuaye them to the place:
Where these too lovers did remain,
Ioying in sight of others face.
And to their foes they did impart:
The place where they should joy their heart.
Prince Baltazer with his compeeres,
Enters my bower all in the night,
And there my son slain they vpreare,
The more to work my greater spite.
But as I lay and took repose*
A voice I hard, whereat I rose.
And finding then his senseless form
The murderers I sought to find,
But missing them I stood forlorn,
As one amassed in his mind.
And rent and pulled my siluered hair,
And cursed and bann'd each thing was there.
And that I would revenge the same,
I dipped a napkin in his blood:
Swearing to work their woeful baine,
That so had spoiled my chiefest good.
And that I would not it forget:
It always at my heart I kept.
The second part
To the same tune.
THen Isabella my dear wife,
Finding her son bereaved of breath,
And loving him dearer then life
Her own hand straight does work her death.
And now their deaths does meet in one:
My griefs are come, my Joys are gone.
Then frantickly I ran about,
Filling the air with mournful groans,
Because I had not yet found out
The murderers to ease my mones.
I rent and tore each thing I got,
And said, and did, I knew not what.
Thus as I past the streets, hard by
The Duke of Castiles house as then
A Letter there I did espy,
Which showed Horatios woeful end.
Which Bellimperia forth had flung.
From prison where they kept her strong.
Then to the Court forthwith I went,
And of the King did Justice crave,
But by Lorenzos bad intent,
I hindered was, which made me rave.
Then vexed more I stamped and frowned,
And with my poniard ripped the ground.
But false Lorenzo put me out,
And told the King then by and by,
That frantickly I ran about,
And of my son did always cry,
And said twere good I should resign:
My Marshall-ship which grieved my mind.
The Duke of Castyle hearing then,
How I did grudge still at his son,
Did send for me to make us friends:
To stay the rumor then begune.
Whereto I straight way gave consent:
Although in heart I never meant.
Sweet Bellimperia comes to me,
Thinking my son I had forgot,
To see me with his foes agree,
The which I never meant God wot:
But when we knew each others mind,
To work revenge a mean I find.
Then Bloody Baltazar enters in
Entreating me to show some sport,
Unto his Father and the King:
That to his nuptial did resort.
Which gladly I prepared to show.
Because I knew twoul'd work their woe.
And from the Chronicles of Spain,
I did record Erastus life,
And how the Turk had him so slain:
And straight revenge wrought by his wife.
Then for to act this Tragedy:
I gave their parts Immediately.
Sweet Bellimperia Baltazar killes,
Because he slew her dearest friend,
And I Lorenzos blood did spill,
And eke his soul to hell did send.
Then dyed my foes by dint of knife,
But Bellimperia ends her life.
Then for to specific my wrongs,
With weeping eyes and mournful heart,
I showed my son with bloody wounds,
And eke the murderers did impart.
And said my son was as dear to me:
as thine, or thine, though Kings you be.
But when they did behold this thing.
How I had slain their only sons:
The Duke, the Viceroy, and the King,
Upon me all they straight did run.
To torture me they do prepare,
Unless I should it straight declare.
But that I would not tell it then,
Even with my teeth I bit my tongue,
And in despite did give it them,
That me with torments sought to wrong:
Thus when in age I sought to rest,
Nothing but sorrows me oppressed.
They knowing well that I could write,
Unto my hand a pen did reach,
Meaning thereby I should recite,
The authors of this bloody f^^ch.
Then fained I my pen was naught
And by strange signs a knife I sought.
But when to me they gave the knife.
I killed the Dake then standing by,
And eke my self bereaved of life,
For I to see my son did hye.
The Kings that scorned my griefs before,
With naught can they their Joys restore;
Here have you heard my Tragic tale.
Which on Horatio's death depends,
Whose death I could anew bewail:
But that in it the murderers ends,
For murder god will bring to light:
Though long it be his from man's sight.
