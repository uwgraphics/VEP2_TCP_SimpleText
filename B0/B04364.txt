The English-French-Mans Address, UPON HIS MAJESTY'S LATE Gracious Declaration:
Humbly Shows, --
T -- HAT Your Dread Majesty,
By Ye'r Gracious Declaration, has set's Free
Of our late Terrors; whereas before we thought,
All our brave All Is would come at length to naught;
But now it is over: Had we gone Home again,
We could not tell, which way for to Maintain
Our Families: In ENGLAND we can take
E'ne what Degrees we please; and make
The Gentry believe, that it is our Nation,
Suits all their Greatness in a Fur Bonne Fashion.
Me that came lately into ENGLISH Ground
With Rags on Back, where Vermin did abound;
Yet had a Sword, though scarce a Shoe to foot,
Aye, and a Shert too, though 'twas black as foot:
Have found the ENGLISH Constitution so,
That I Will be hanged, e're I to FRANCE will go
Again in haste; There I wanted bread,
Here, of a Family, I Am become the head:
My Master loves me, and does still, Protest
Of his Servants, the Mounsieur is the best;
For when with our Kick-shaws about they prance,
We Swear Begar, it is Ala Mode de FRANCE.
Thus we get into Favor, and then we
Are Parra-Mount, of all the Family:
We tell his Lordship, that it is nothing sitting,
De ENGLISH Cook, should Rule his Lordships Kitching;
Swearing, De ENGLISH Cook he cannot tell,
Which way to make De Bonne Potazie well:
He burns the Meat Begar, and I do think
His Sauce is musty; and his Beef does stink;
You no smell my Lord: Your Cold does spoil
Your Scent, and your Cook, does beguile
Your Honor, and Me cannot endure
De ENGLISH Cook; De Bonne French Serveture:
He is De best Begar, Me dare to swear,
He Would fit your Lordship, to a very hair:
De ENGLISH Man, Begar Me know is Stout,
But in de Carriage, he is but a Lout,
Compared with De FRENCH: He cannot Dance,
Nor Cheat's Lord, with a Bonne Sir-Reverence.
Now wide de Ladies, de Women are as Good
To Curle de Hair, and for to set de Hood,
As any in de world, der's none does know
How to do it like de French, it is we dat show
De ENGLISH Woman: Me will tell you what,
De ENGLISH Woman, nothing but talk and prate.
Me Tutor de Infant, nay, what is more,
Teach Men to play de Rogue, and Wench de Whore:
When dat Me see a Bonne handsome VVench,
Out of pure love, Me teach her Parler French:
If she have Money, den I straight will swear,
De French Man is in Love wide her Begar:
And it is de best for her, do all she can,
To Marry de fur bonne French Gentleman:
When de Gentleman does love de handsome Woman
Not for his Wife, but for to make her Common;
Then Me do go, pretending to sell Lace,
And in a Point I often a letter place,
To bring her to my Bow, and then I,
Am feed by both hands for my Bawdry:
Thus we help one another, and do displace
The ENGLISH Servitures; by thus disgrace-
-- Ing of them, and through some Elusion,
Make the FRENCH happy with tothers Confusion.
Now if Your Majesty would have us swear,
Prescribe the Oath, what it is, we do not Care,
So we can still reside here, rather then we
Should now go Home, we will forswear Country
And King, and All; For here we can Invade
Your True Born Subjects, by working on the Trade
For which they served: Should they do so in FRANCE
VVe'd rather hang 'um, then let them advance
Themselves by our Professions, let them not think,
Out of our Country, they shall carry Chink:
No! we are more wise; we will first let them know,
What peril it is, the FRENCH does undergo
At Home: But yet in ENGLAND here
'Bove ENGLISHMEN, it is known we Domineere,
And shall do still; Unless Your Majesty,
Prescribe to us a Day of Jubilie:
For we to one another are Good-VVillers,
And in Your Land Egyptian Caterpillars.
