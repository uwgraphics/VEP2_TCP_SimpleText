His Majesty at His first Sitting in His Privy Council, was Graciously pleased
to Express Himself in this manner:
My Lords, England are for Monarchy, and the Members of it have showed
themselves Good and Loyal Subjects, therefore I shall always take care to
Defend and Support It. I know too that the Laws of England are sufficient to
make the King at Great a Monarch as I can Wish; And as I shall never Depart
from the Just Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, so I shall never Invade any
Man's Property. I have often heretofore ventured My Life in Defense of this
Nation; And I shall still go as far as any man in preserving it in all its Just
Rights and Liberties.

Whereupon the Lords of the Council were humble Suitors to His Majesty, That
these His Gracious Expressions might be made public, which His Majesty did
Order accordingly.

Sacred Majesty: Anno DOM. 1685.
