HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation for the commanding of all Soldiers, lately employed in the
Fleet, upon their arrival, not to depart from their Colors.
WHereas diverse of the Ships, which were lately set to Sea in Our Fleet in
October last, are expected shortly to arrive in some of Our Ports, in the
Western parts of this Our Realm, and many of the Land Soldiers, employed by
Us in that Service, are also expected to return home in those Ships: Forasmuch
as We shall have present use of the Service of those Soldiers, who, if they
should retire themselves and be dis-banded, could not be so easily gathered
together again, as the necessity of their Service does require; Our express
pleasure therefore is, and We do hereby straightly charge and command, That no
Soldier, which was employed in any of those Ships, upon their arrival in any
Port of this Our Realm, or in any part of Our Dominions, shall depart from his
Colors, or be discharged from his Service, until We shall signify Our
Royal pleasure, when, and how we will use their further Service: And this to
be strictly observed and obeyed by all, whom it may concern, upon pain of
the seuerest Punishments, Penalties, and Forfeitures, which by the Laws and
Statutes of this Our Realm, or by Our Prerogative Royal can be inflicted upon
the Offenders.

Given at Our Court at Windsor, the fifteenth day of December, in the first
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and John Bill, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXV.
