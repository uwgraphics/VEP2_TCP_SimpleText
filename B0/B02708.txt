Damon and Celia, Or, the languishing Lover comforted.
Of all new Songs, the Poet hopes that this
Will please you well, because he knows it is
A very good one, you may find hereby,
There Is nothing lost by loving constantly.
Which ought to be all honest Lovers Guide
But as for such who no delays abide;
Let them love one, for half and hour no more,
And when they have done go call their Mrs. whore.
To a pleasant New playhouse Tune, Called No, no it is in vain, etc.




NO, no, it is in vain,
Though I sigh and complain,
Yet the secret I Will never reveal:
The VVracks shall not tear it,
From my breast, but I Will bear it,
to the Grave, where it ever shall dwell:
Oh! would that the Gods had created her low,
and plat'd the poor Hylas above,
Then, then I a present might freely bestow,
of a heart that is all over Love.
Like the Damned from the fire,
I may gaze and admire,
Yet never can hope to be bless:
Oh the pangs of a Love,
That dares not discover,
The Poison that lodged in his Breast:
Like a Deer that is wounded I bleeding run on,
and fain I the passion would hide,
But oh it is vain, for wherever I run,
the bloody Dart sticks in my side.
Like a Ship on the Ocean,
That Is ever in motion,
Continually tumbled and tossed:
When each greedy wave
Portendeth a grave
and on the hard Rock to be lest:
Each frown from my Celia does threaten my woe
which alas I find to be true,
My torments do follow where ever I go,
it is in vain to ^^ye, fate will pursue.
If the cause she would discover,
To her languishing Lover,
Why, why she so cruel does prove,
An Alter i will raise,
And her anger appease,
By a sacrificed heart to her Love:
Then Cupid would know the fault lay not in me
and ease my destraction and pain,
Methinks to his Godhead an honor twould be,
in making her love me again.
But if he take part,
To destroy my poor heart
Then i will curse both his Quiver and Bow,
For he if he please,
Can to Lovers give ease,
And make them his power to know,
My Celia from blame I will ever set free,
and her name I will always adore,
She Is a Goddess on earth, to be worshipped by me
expecting her blessing in store.


Celia's Kind Answer.

IT is not in vain,
You do sigh and complain,
For the secret to me is revealed:
My Breast now does bear it,
Where for ever I Will wear it,
such flames cannot long be concealed:
The Gods have created me low to your mind,
and placed your affections above,
The present I ask is that still you would prove kind
and give me that heart full of Love.
Like the blessed free from trouble,
Tur joys still may double,
And never no sorrow can know,
Then happy's that Lover,
Which dares not discover,
Those flames which occasion his woe:
Like a prisoner set free, he may sing and rejoice
when he from confinement is clear,
If his Love prove kind, then thrice happy's his choice,
no bloody darts after appear.
Like a Merchant whose treasure
Comes home in full, measure,
From the Indies who long have been gone,
Such joys do abound,
To a Lover that is Crowned,
With success, that before looked for none:
Now smile my dear Damon, the day is your own,
no more of your Celia complain,
Your constancy my true affections has won,
then count not your sorrows in vain.
It was only to Try ye,
Which made me deny ye,
The cause now you certainly know,
My heart you shall have,
Till cold death to the Grave,
Does force us to pay what we owe:
Little Cupid has heard thee, and made me prove kind,
he heard your complains every day,
But when the night came, he did torture my mind
by telling me what you did say.
He was your best friend,
And your suit did commend,
Then pretty sweet Damon, no more,
Let Us not angry prove,
To the God of our love,
but for ever his power adore:
My heart is thy own, and i will give thee my hand,
we will marry and make no delay,
And I my own self will be at thy command,
to please thee by night and by day.
