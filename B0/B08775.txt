THE Citizens of London, by their Charter, among themselves may Make Sheriffs
whom they will, and may Remove them when they will.

Therefore the Sheriffs and Common Sergeant for the time being, are, in
Election of Sheriffs for the ensuing year, Servants to the common Hall, and
ought to propose and Poll for such Persons and such things as shall be
nominated and demanded by the Members thereof and for none else.

By a pretended By-Law, It Is Ordered to this effect, viz. That whosoever shall
be elected Sheriff and Refuse to serve, shall swear himself not worth 10000 l.
or enter into Bond to serve, or shall pay 400 l. fine, and in case a Person
elected pay his Fine, he is not to be proposed again for that year.

By an Act of Parliament made since this, by Law it is amongst other things
enacted to this effect, That the Election of any Officers having any place of
trust in any Corporation shall be void, in case the Person so elected shall not
have received the Sacrament, according to the Church of England, within a year
next before such choice.

Now the two Gentlemen declared to be elected on Midsummer day last, having not
been duly qualified as to receiving the Sacrament according to the Statute,
such Election was void, and so they are in no Capacity whatsoever within their
By-law.

But they having since received the Sacrament, according to the Statute, their
Election at this time will be legal and valid, which cannot be assured in Case
any other shall be elected, it being altogether uncertain who is duly qualified.
