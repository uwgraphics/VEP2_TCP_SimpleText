Unto his Grace, His Majesty's high Commissioner; and the right Honorable the
Estates of Parliament The PETITION of Henry Borthwick Son to the Deceast
William Borthwick Chyrurgian Apothecary.
Humbly shows,
THat where my deceast Father by his Nomination dated the 18th. of February,
1689. years, did nominat and appoint Sir Thomas Stuart of Balcaskie, Sir John
Fowlis of Ravelstoun Sir John Young of Leny John Stuart of Garntilly, Mr. John
Menzies Advocat, Archbald Young Brother German to the said Sir John Young, and
Mr. Robert Lawder of Beillmonth to be my Tutors, recomending the same persons
to be chosen by me for my Curators with this express proviso that they should
be no farther liable by the acceptance of the said Offices than conform to
their actual Intromissions allenarly, and should no ways be holden to count for
such Omissions, but only to do such Diligence as any provident man is in use to
do in his own Affairs, dispensing with all Laws and Pratiques in the contrary,
upon the faith of which Nomination and foresaid Conditions therein expressed, my
said Tutors accepted but now that the Tutory is ended, and I have in Obedience
to my Fathers Recomendation chosen the said Sir Thomas Stuart, Sir John Fowlis,
Mr. John Menzies, and Archbald Young to be my Curators they demurr to accept
and are grown doubtful of the forsaid Provision in my Fathers Nomination in
their Favors, whereby it happens that both they and all others stand off from
meddling in my Affairs and and I am like to be quite destitute of all Assistance
of Friends, during my whole Minority, notwithstanding that my Father left much
Business, and particulary many Book Debts that are like to perish for want of
the Assistance forsaid, and seeing that this case is extraordinar, and that my
said Friends have already acted upon the Faith of the said Nomination, as also
that our Law has no Remedy, when all persons refuse to be Curators, His
Majesty's Care of Minors, extending no farther than Pupiliarity.

May it therefore please your Grace and Lordships, in consideration of the
Premises, to interpose your Authority to the said Nomination and Provision
therein expressed, in favors of may said Tutors and Curators, to the effect they
may both accept for the future, and be safe both as to bygons, and in time
coming, for all their Actings conform to the Trust, and free of all hazards,
whereof my Father has expressly freed them. And your Grace and Lordships
Petitioner shall ever pray.
