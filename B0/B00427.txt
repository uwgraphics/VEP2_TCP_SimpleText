An excellent new Medly.
To to tune of the Spanish Pauin.
When Philomel begins to sing,
the grass grows green and flowers spring,
Me thinks it is a pleasant thing,
to walk on Primrose hill,
Maids have you any Connie-skins
To sell for Laces or great Pinnes
The Pope will pardon venial sins:
Saint Peter,
Fresh fish and news grew quickly stale:
Some say good wine can nere want sale,
But God send poor folks Beer and Ale,
enough until they die
Most people now are full of pride.
The Boy said no but yet be lyde:
His Aunt did to the Cuck-stoole ride
for scolding.
Within our Town fair Susan dwells:
Sure Meg is poisoned, for the swells,
My friend pull often your bazzards bells,
and let the haggard (...).
Take heed you play not at Tray-trip.
Short heels forsooth will quickly flip.
The beadle makes folk with his whip,
dance naked.
Come rapster tell us what is to pay,
Jane frownd and cryde good Sir away.
She took his kindness. yet said nay,
as Maidens use to do,
The man shall have his Mare again,
When all false knaves prove honest men.
Our Sisly shall be Sainted then,
true Roger.
The Butcher with his masty Dog
At Rumford you may buy a Hog,
I faith Raph Goose has got a clog,
his wench is great with child.
In Pillory put the Bakers head,
For making of such little bread,
Good conscience now a days is dead,
Pierce plowman.
The Cutpurse and his Company
Thieves find receivers presently:
Shun Brokers, Bawdes, and Usury,
for fear of after-claps.
Lord, what a wicked world is this
The stone lets Kate she cannot piss:
Come hither sweet and take a kiss
in kindness
In Bath a wanton wife did dwell,
She had two buckers to a well,
Would not a dog for anger swell,
to see a pudding creep:
The Horse-leach is become a Smith,
When haiters fail then cake a With:
They say an old man has no pith,
Round Robin.
Simon does suck up all the Eggs,
Frank never drinks without Nutmegs,
And pretty Parnell shows her legs,
as slender as my waste.
When fair Jerusalem did stand,
The match is made give me thy hand,
Maulkin must have a Cambrick hand
blew starched.
The Cu^kow sung hard by the door,
Gyll brawled like a butter whore
Cause her buckeheaded Husband swore
the Miller was a knave.
Good Poets leave of making plays
Let players seek for Soldiers pays
I do not like the drunken fraies,
in Smithfield.
Now Roysters spurs do gingle brave,
John Sexton played the arrand kanue.
To dig a Coarse out of the Grave.
and steal the sheet away.
The wandering Prince of stately Troy
Green sleeves were wont to be my joy,
He is a blind and paultry boy
god Cupid,
Come hither friend and give good ear,
A leg of mutton stuffed is rare,
Take heed you do not steal my Mare,
it is so hot it burns.
Behold the trial of true love,
He took a scrich-Owle for a Dove:
This man is like ere long to prove
a Monster.
It Is merry when kind Maltmen meet:
No Cowards fight but in the street,
Me thinks this wench smells very sweet,
of Musk, or somewhat else.
There was a man did play at Maw,
The whilst his wife made him a daw,
Your Case is altered in the law,
quoth ployden.
The Weaver will no shuttle shoot,
Go bid the Cobbler mend my boot
He is a fool will go a foot
and let his Horse stand still.
Did John a Nokes and John a Styles,
Many an honest man beguiles.
But all the world is full of wiles
and knavery.
Of treason and of Traitors spite
The house is haunted with a sprit,
Now Nan will rise about midnight,
and walk to Richards house.
You Courtly states and gallants all,
Climb not too hie for fear you fall:
If one please not another shall,
King pipping.
Diana and her Darlings dear,
The Dutchmen ply the double Beer:
Boys rings the bells and make good cheer
when Kempe returns from Rome,
O man what means thy heavy look
Is Will not in his Mistress Book,
Sir Rouland for a refuge took
Horne-Castle
Rich people have the world at will
Trades fade, but Lawiers flourish still,
Jack would be married unto Gyll:
but care will kill a Cat.
Are you there Sirrah with your Bears,
A Barbers shop with nittie hairs.
Doll, Phillis has lost both her ears,
for coozning.
Who list to lead a soldiers life:
Tom would eat meat but wants a knife,
The Tinker swore that Tib his wife,
would play at uptailes all
Believe my word without an an Oath
The Tailor stole some of her cloth:
When George lay sick and loan made him broth
with Hemlocke.
The Patron gelt the parsonage,
And Esau sold his heritage,
Now Leonard lack-wit is fool age,
to be his Fathers heir.
There Is many scratch before it itch,
Saul did ask counsel of a Witch.
Friend, ye may have a Bacon flitch
at Dunmow.
King David played on a Welsh Harp,
This thread will never make good warpe
At wise men's words each fool will carpe
and shoot their witless bolts.
Ione like a Ram wore horns and wool.
Knew you my Hostis of the Bull,
Spure Curio once was made a gull
in Shoreditch
The blackamores are blabber lipt,
At yarmouth are the Herrings shipped,
And at Bride-well the beggars whipped,
a man may live and learn,
Grief in my heart does stop my tongue,
The poor man still must put up wrong,
Your way lies there then walk along,
to Witham
Theee lies a Less that I love well,
The Broker has gay clothes to sell,
Which from the Hangmans budget fell,
are you no further yet?
In Summer times when Pears be ripe,
Who would give sixpence for a Tripe,
Play Lad or else lend me thy Pipe
and Taber.
Saint Nicholas Clerks will take a purse,
Young children now can swear and curse
I hope ye like me nere the worse,
for finding fault therewith.
The servant is the Masters mate.
When gossips meet, there is too much prate
Poor Lazarus lies at Dives gate
half starued,
Make have to Sea, and hoyst up sails
The hogs were serud with milking pales
From filthy sluts, and from all Ioayles,
good Lord deliver us all.
I scorn to ride a raw boned Jade,
Fetch me a Mattocke and a Spade,
A Graves end Toste will soon be made,
Saint Dennis.
But for to finish up my Song,
The Ale-wife did the brewer wrong,
One day of sorrow seems as long
as ten days do of mirth,
My Medly now is at an end,
Have you no Bowls or Trayes to mend
It Is hard to find so true a friend
as Damon.
FINIS.
Printed by the Assigns of Thomas Symcocke.
