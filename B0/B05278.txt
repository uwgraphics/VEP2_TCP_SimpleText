ACT against Solicitation.
Edinburgh, November 6. 1677.
THE Lords of Council and Session taking to their serious Consideration, that
by several Acts of Sederunt, the Lords have formerly Prohibited all
Solicitations, in Causes depending before them, whereby Parties did endeavor
and expect savor, by the Credit and Moyen of themselves, or their Friends
interposing with the Lords, and personal respects not relating to the Cause, to
the great discouragement of others, who had not the like Friendship, or Moyen,
and to the great trouble of all, conceiving it their Interest, and that it
might be looked on as a slight, or neglect, if they did not upon all occasions,
by themselves or their Friends Solicit the whole Lords at their Houses, lying
scattered through the several places of the City, imagining thereby to have much
promoted their Interest, and paid respect to the Lords, who have no regard to,
but are troubled with such Solicitations, it being their duty and design to do
Justice to all impartially, without respect of persons: Notwithstanding of
which Acts and Endeavors of the Lords against Solicitations, the same have
been revived upon pretense of giving Information in the Cause: But now seeing
written Informations are become ordinary, and that all that ought to be
represented to the Lords, in any case, may easily, and without trouble be done
by written Informations, sent to the Lords by a Servant, which they will
heartily accept, and will not fail to peruse: And finding it unfeasable to
hinder Solicitations, so long as they admit of Verbal Information: Therefore
the Lords do Declare, That they will admit of no Solicitation, or verbal
Information, in any Cause depending, or that shall depend before them, during
the Dependence thereof, either by the Parties themselves, or by any other
person; And to the end the same may be effectual against all importunity, The
said Lords Do Enact, and Declare, that it shall be a relevant Reason of
Declinator, against any of the said Lords, ordinary or extraordinary, that
they have received, or heard any Solicitation, or Verbal Information in the
Cause during the dependence thereof, but upon the first observing, that the
matter offered to be spoken to them, did bear, or import any Solicitation, or
Verbal Information, in a Cause depending, if they did not use all the means
they could to stop or withdraw to hear any further thereof; or in case any
Solicitation, or Information in a Cause depending, be offered by a Missive
Letter, if they do not present the same to the Lords: Like as the said Lords
Do strictly prohibit all Advocats, Clerks, Writers and others, depending on
the College of Justice, or their Servants to offer to any of the Lords any
Solicitation or Information by Word or Letter, but only by written
Information*, Bills, or Tickets for Calling, under the pain of Deprivation, and
being secluded from the House, excepting the Clerk of the Process, for clearing
any Interlocutor or Minu^e in the Cause: Likeas the said Lords Do Declare,
That if any party, or others of the Leidges, offer any Solicitation or
Information, by Word or Missive, that they will amerciat them as follows, viz.
Every Nobleman in 300 Merks Scots Money; Every Baron or Knight in 200 merks;
every other Heretor, Gentleman, or chief Burgess in 100 pounds; and every other
person in 100 merks, toties quoties, to be applied for the use of the poor. It
is always hereby Declared, that the verbal Information of any Party, or other
person for him, when required, or allowed Judicially, or before Auditors, in
Dyets appointed for both Parties to be heard, or before the Ordinaries upon the
Bills, in relation to the passing of Bills of Suspension, or Advocation, or
Advocation, or before any of the Lords, to whom either by consent of Parties,
or by appointment, or recommendation of the Lords, an accommodation in any
Process is referred, is no ways hereby prohibited. And to the effect the
Leidges may be secured against any prejudice, which they may apprehend by
debarring them from Solicitation, or verbal Information; The Lords do Declare,
that there shall be free access for all persons to Inform them by written
Informations only, to be delivered by Servants; and that in all cases from time
to time; And for the more sure delivery of Informations, they ordain that every
one of the Lords shall have a Servant attending in his House, from five a
Clock, to eight a Clock at night, who shall be holden to receive any
Informations, doubles of Bills, or Tickets for Calling, that shall be given in
without payment of any Money, under such pain or punishment as the Lords shall
think fit; And which Informations, Bills and Tickets, shall be delivered by the
Servants of Advocats, or of the Parties, and by none others, and they Ordain
this Act to be affixed on the Wall of the Outter-House. And to be Printed,
that none may pretend Ignorance thereof.

Edinburgh, December 24. 1679.
THE Lords of Council and Session Considering, that notwithstanding of the Act
made against Solicitation and verbal Information, dated the sixth of November,
1677. years, yet some persons are so bold as to adventure to Solicit the Lords
in their Actions, and it being the Resolution of the said Lords, that so
Laudable and necessary an Act be made effectual; Therefore they Declare, that
in any Process now depending, or which shall hereafter be Intented before them,
when the same comes to be Advised, they will purge themselves concerning their
receiving any Solicitation, or verbal Information in the Cause, if it shall
either be desired by the Parties, or moved by any of their own number, and that
they will delate the persons who do Solicit, or verbally Inform them, that
they may be punished therefore, conform to the said Act.

Edinburgh, November 11. 1690.
THe Lords of Council and Session do Ordain their Acts of Sederunt, of the
sixth of November 1677, and the 24 of December 1679. against Solicitation to be
Printed, and affixed on the Wall of the Outer-House; and they Ordain these Acts
to be observed in all points.

GOD save King WILLIAM and Queen MARY.

Excellent Majesty's, Anno Dom. 1690.
