LONDONS LORD H^VE MERCY UPON US. A true Relation of seven moder^ Plagues or
Visitations in LONDON, wit^ the number of those that were Buried of all
Diseases; Viz. The first in the year of Queen Elizabeth, Anno 1592. The second,
in the year 1603 the third, in (that never to be forgotten Year) 1625. The
fourth in Anno 1630. The fifth, in the year 1636. The sixth in the year 1637.
and 1638. The seventh this present year. 1665.
Certain approved Medicines for the Plague, both to prevent that contagion, and
to expel it after it be taken; as have been Approved in Anno 1625. as also in
this present Visitation, 1665.

A cheap Medicine to keep from infection.
TAke a pint of new Milk, and cut two cloves of Garlic very small, put it in
the milk, and drink it mornings fasting, and it preserves from infection.



A Posset Drink to remove the Plague from the Heart.
AN Ale Posset Drink with Pimpernel seethed in it, till it tastes strong of it,
drunk often, removes the Infection, though it has got to the very Heart.

An approved Remedy against the Plague.
TAke a sprig of Rue, alias, herb of-grace, and shred it, and put it in a Figg
or two, and eat it every morning fasting, it keeps the Body from Infection. and
purifieth the blood.

REader, what ever thou art, rich or poor,
Rowse up thy self, for Death stands at the door;
If God says strike, he must and will come in
For death we know is the reward of sin.
His very breath is so infectious grown,
He poisons every one he breathes upon;
He is the Rich-man's terror, makes him fly,
And bear away his baggs, as loath to die.
What shall the Poor do that behind do stay?
Death makes them rich, by taking them away.
But what shall Poor men do, that here do live,
It Is surely fit the Rich should comfort give,
And weekly Means unto them still afford:
Oh such Rich men shall be rich in the Lord!
Death startles all, but (...) of sin,
Which sinful man long time ^ath lived in,
Does make them fearful of that punishment
Due unto sin, for time that ^vil spent.
Oh why was this not thought ^n long ago!
When God expected our R^entance so?
Seventeen years since, a little Plague God sent,
He shoke his Rod to move us to repent:
Not long before that time, a dearth of Corn
Was sent to us to see if we would turn:
And after that, there is none deny it can;
The Beasts did suffer for the sin of man:
Grass was so short and small, that it was told,
Hay for four pound a Load was daily sold.
These Judgments God bath sent even to cite us
Unto Repentance, and from sin to fright us.
Oh stubborn England! childish and unwife,
So heavy laden with iniquities:
Return, return, unto thy loving Father,
Return I say with speed, so much the rather,
Because his Son thy Savior pleads thy cause,
Though thou have broken all his holy Laws:
Say to thy self, My sins are cause of all
Gods Judgments that upon this I and do fall,
And sin's the cause that each one does complain,
They have too much, sometimes to little rain:
Say to thy self, this Plague may he removed,
If I repent, as plainly may be proved
By Niniveh, that City great and large,
For God has given unto his Angels Charge,
To strike and to forbear as he sees fit;
If it be so, then learn thou so much wit,
To use thy best endeavor to prevent
A plague, which thou may do if thou repent,
Let all infected Houses be thy Text,
And make this Use, that thine may be the next.
The Red Cross still is used, as it has bin.
To show they Christians are that are within:
And Lord have mercy on us on the Door,
Puts thee in mind, to pray for them therefore.
The Watchman that attends the house of sorrow,
He may attend upon thy House to morrow
Oh Where Is the vows we to our God have made!
When death and sickness came with Axe and Spade,
And hurled our Brethren up in heaps apace,
Even forty thousand in a little space:
The Plague among us is not yet removed,
Because that sin of us is still beloved.
Each spectacle of Death and Funeral,
Puts thee and I in mind, We must die all.
