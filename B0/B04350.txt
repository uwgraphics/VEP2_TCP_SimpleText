Good People listen and you will find,
the Run of a Maiden
Whose tender (...) to love inclined,
her mind was (...) laden,
Not Eighteen year she was it is said,
and yet was disco^^^nted,
Ah fair unhappy (...) maid,
who was in mind tormented.
She was of vvealthy Parents bred,
and had good Education,
And was a comely virtuous Maid,
as any in the Nation,
The Father and the Mother to,
with her they much were pleased,
But Death about six Month ago,
on her dear Father seized.
And since with melancholliness,
this maiden has been taken,
And 'tvvas for love as many guess,
if they are not mistaken.
Her Mother with a tender care,
was still to please her Daughter,
Sent her to Hamstead for the Air,
but mark what happened afte^.
On Saturday this maiden fair,
unto the Wells was vvalking,
Two or three did attend her there
to please her in her talking:
But when they of young Lovers spoke,
and happened to name many,
She sighed as if her heart had broke,
and wish^d she never had any
But these divertions would not do,
the maiden was for moving,
Well madam stay, and we will go to,
you will find me at my Lodging
She vvalked on with such a speed,
that they could not come nigh her,
And privately took Coach indeed,
for London, saying, drive her.
And when the Coachman she had cleared,
to Powls-Wharf straight she highed,
Which was at ten a Night we heard,
Next Skuller the men cried,
But she replied, No, no, no,
the little Boys i will go we the,
And to the Bankside I will go
and thither Children row me.
When in the middle they were rovv'd,
without one Word of speaking,
Out of the Boat herself she throvv'd.
the Boys hearts they were aching,
For they their Fair could see no more,
and being thus benighted,
They hastily Rovv'd to the shore,
and terribly were frighted.
But the next morn at break of day,
near London Bridge was 'spyed
Hitch'd to the Post this maiden lay,
who in the River died,
And in her Pocket there was found,
a Letter did discover,
The cause why she herself did drovvn,
'tvvas for a perjured Lover.
Oh! cruel Lovers be more kind,
unto soft hearted maidens.
And keep the Oaths that you do bind,
which makes them heavy Laden,
For perjured Vovvs who can them bear,
young men I do declare it,
When you break what you vow and swear
young maidens cannot bear it.
And this Advice she left behind,
young maids be not deceived,
though young men swear and seem most kind,
they are not to be believed,
But shun them least you Perish to,
Yet this I must discover,
Blessed is the Maid whose Lover's true,
and happy is the Lover.
