Well met my pretty Betty
happy be our Meeting,
I prithee on me take pity,
and thus he fell a Greeting:
Thou art she whom I love so dear,
above all worldly Treasure,
There Is no Love with mine can compare,
I love thee beyond all measure.
Bettys Reply to John.
I wonder John, how it came about,
that you should love so dearly,
I fear you do but jeer and flout,
I prithee don't come near me;
And don't stand prating at this rate,
but I prithee now be going,
Or with my Ladle i will break thy Pate,
for I like no deceitful Wooing.
I prithee Betty be not Coy,
but let us enjoy the Blessing,
I Will tell thee what thoust enjoy,
of Goods I have possessing:
I have got a You and Lamb
with a Cow and Calf together,
have that will bravely stand,
will make thee a glad Mother,

I have a Cupboard and three Chairs,
with Dishes and a Ladle,
Beside a Barrel to hold good Beer,
also a Nursing Cradle:
I have Spindles, Whirls and Reels,
with Feather-Bed and Bedding,
And a new Spinning-Wheel,
which thou shall have at our Wedding.
I have a little Dog to Bark,
if any come to fright thee,
My House is as safe as Noah's Ark,
in which I will delight thee:
The pretty Crickets they do sing,
whilst I am in the Barn a Thrashing,
They Will be Pleasing when thou do Spin,
or Bake, Brew, or Washing.
My Mother left me twenty hives of Bees
which will yield good store of Honey,
We Will gather up all and none we will leese,
it will bring us good store of Money:
I have eight Pigs and a Sow,
with Hens and Chickens plenty,
I have beside all this, I vow,
two Brood-Geese and Gossins twenty.
I have got a gay Gold Ring,
for my pretty Betty,
And i will please thee in every thing,
then I prithee on me take pity:
A black Scarf spick and span New,
Gloves and Ribbons, newest Fashion,
If thou will have me tell me now,
and don't put me into a passion.
The Maid began of smile at this,
and was pleased at his Fancy,
The Bargain she Seal*d with a Kiss,
and said, John's the Man I sancy
Thou shall be my hearts delight,
and I will be thy Honey,
We Will work together day and night,
and I hope we shall never want Money.
The day appointed was with speed,
when they was to be Married,
Their Friends likewise did agree,
that nothing should be miscarried:
There was both Wine, Ale and Beer,
all sorts of Provision plenty,
A Noise of Music their hearts to cheer,
Strawberries and Cream most dainty.
Then they to Dancing went,
each Lad then with their Lasses,
They kissed each Lass with their consent,
so the time away they passes:
The Fiddler sung them a Merry Song,
which caused much Laughter,
And John began for to think long,
for the Pastime he should have after.
