LIFE and DEATH OF THE Piper of KilbarchanOR,
The Epitaph of Habbie Simpson,
He made his Cheeks as red as Crimson,
Who on his Dron bore bonny Flags,
And babed when he blew the Bags,
Kilbarchan now may say alas!
For she has lost her game and grace
Both Trixie and the Maiden-trace
B^^ what rem^ed?
For no Man can supply his place,
H^^ Simphon's dead,
Now who shall play the day it daws
Or hunts up when the Cock he craws
Or who can for our Kirk Town Cause,
stand us in stead?
On Bag-pipes now no body blaws,
For Habbie's dead,
Or who shall cause our Shearers shear
Who will bend up the Brags of Weir?
Bring in the Bells or good play Meir,
In time of need,
Hab Simpson could what needs you spear
But now he is dead.
So kindly to his Neighbor neist,
At Belian and Saint Barchans Feast
He blew and then held up his Breast,
as he were weid,
But now we need not him arrest?
For Habbie's dead,
At Fairs he played before the Spear-men
All gayly graithed in their Geer-men,
Steel Bonners, Jacts and Swords so clear
Like any Bead.
Now who will play before such Weirmen then
Sen Habbie's dead,
At Clark plays when be wont to come
His Pipe played trimly to the Drum:
Like Bikes of bees he gait it bum
And turn his Reed:
Now all our Pipers my sing dum
Sen Habbie's dead,
And at Horse-races many a day,
Before the Black, the Brown and Gray
He gart his Pipe when he did play,
Both Ski^l and Sk^ed:
Now all such pastime's quite away
Sen Habbie's dead,
He counted was a walled wight Man,
And fiercely at Football he ran;
At every Game the gree he wan,
For pith and speed
The like of Habbie was not then,
But now he is dead,
And then beside his valiant Acts,
At Brydels he wan many placks.
He babbed ay behind Folks backs,
And shook his Head,
Now we want many merry Cracks
Sen Habbie's dead.
He was convoyer of the bride,
With Kittock hanging at his side,
About the Kirk he thought a pride
the Ring to Lead
But now she may go but a Guide
For Habbie's dead.
So well's he kept his Decorum.
And all the steps of Whip-meg morum,
He slew a man and wae^s me for him
And bare the seed.
But yet the man wan Hame before him
and was not dead,
Ay when he played the Lasses leugh,
To sea him toothless, old and reuch
He wan his Pipes beside Barcleugh
withoutten dread,
Which after wan him Gear enough
But now he is dead.
Alas for him my heart is sare,
For of his Springs I got a Share,
At every play, Race, Feast and Fair,
But Guile or Greed
We need not look for piping mair,
Sen Habbie's dead,
FINIS
