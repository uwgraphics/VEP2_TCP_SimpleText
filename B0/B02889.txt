THE Lord RUSSELS Farewell, Who was Beheaded for High Treason, in
Lincolns-Inn-Fields' JVLY 21st. 1683.
To the Tune of, Tender hearts of London City.




^ Paid the bane of humane creatures, will corrupt the best of natures, when
it soars

^ to its full height, who can stand it or command it, when the object is in
sight?

Reason is no more our jewel,
When our dearest thoughts are cruel,
all her Maxims are forgot:
Else what reason, was for Treason,
as this base inhumane Plot.
Russel that enjoyed the treasure,
Every way repleat with pleasure,
had Alegience quite forgot:
Hopes of ^^i^^ing did advise him,
to this base inhumane Plot.


Who alas! could he desire,
That himself could not require,
pride did only him besott;
To aspire to grow higher,
By a base inhumane Plot.
Safely might have lived for ever,
In a gracious Princes favor,
and more honor there have got:
Then his thoughts what e're they wrought,
By any base inhumane Plot.
Those false hopes that did deceive him,
With his nature will nht leave him,
nor with his poor body rot:
Whilst records, the world affords,
his Treason never will be forgot.
Better be the Earl of Bedford,
Then for Treason loose his Head for it,
and to make his name a blot:
In each Lybel as a Rebbell,
In a base inhumane Plot.
If his Prince had ever left him,
Or of any Grace bereft him,
e're his Treason force his Lot:
Yet-Obedience and Alegience,
should have kept him from this Plot.
Treason is a Crime against nature,
Against Kings the highest matter,
sure can never be forgot:
He that blames him does profane him
and his soul is in the Plot.
Russel died then unlamented,
By all men but who consented
to this damned inhumane Plot:
To Distroy the Nations joy,
the King and Monarchy should Rot.
But Heavens preserve the Crimson Royal
And bring all the rest to trial
who Alegience have forgot:
And confounded be each Roundhead,
in this damned inhumane Plot.
FINIS.
