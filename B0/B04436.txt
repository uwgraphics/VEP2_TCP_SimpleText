On the DEATH of the ILLUSTRIOUS DAVID EARL of WEMYSS, etc. One of the most
Honorable Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council.
ELEGY.
AS Great Men do, their Vassals charge and call,
Them to attend another Funeral;
Neptune bids Triton warn each Christal-Spring
A Flood of Tears into Forths-Firth to bring,
To wait His murmuring Tides, upon Wemys Shore,
That Noble Earls Death still to deplore,
Whose Hollow-Rockie-Caves, with Eccho's may
Teach Swans to weep, in an unwonted way,
And Rampant-Lyons, hence to roar with Grief,
Their Lord and Master is bereaved of Life:
Each Navigator sails Fifes pleasant Coast,
To moan the Anchor of their hope is lost;
For whom built Peer and Harbor safe and sure,
No raging storm can Shipping there injure:
But all this nothing to those Sorrows, that
Of which this Kingdom must participat;
King, Nobles, Gentry, Clergy, most concerned,
A braver Subject Monarch never governed;
Wished that his Soveraigns-Crowns in concord flourish,
And Heavens good-success all His Projects cherish,
Whose, and the Publique's safety did desire,
Free from all Plots, Rebellion can conspire;
Straight Loyal-Rule to Statesmen of the Land,
How to Obey, and likewise to Command:
From Passion free, unto sound Council prone,
Rich'd with the Wisdom of a Solomon:
Promotion and Seditious ways did hate,
Endeavored rather to be Good than Great;
Court Parasitick flatteries did scorn,
By whom Truth and Integrity were born:
To Law and Gospel Zealous Constant Friend,
Religious Worship in the Church maintained;
Faith justified with unfaign'd Charity,
The Luckie H(...) Liberality.
In Virtuous Actions all the Age excelled,
At Work a Thousand Souls daily upheld;
Gave Colleges, Schools, Artists, and each Muse
Encouragement Their Genious to use;
Augustian Sp'rit, yet of Meek humble mind,
The Worlds best Breeding by Thee was refined;
Renowned Fame of whom can well report,
More Hospitable never kept Princely Court,
Fraughted with Courage and Mag'nimity,
Honored all Orders of Nobility;
In Converse Mirthful, Jovial and Sweet,
With Clemency made Mercy Justice meet;
With Coal, and Salt, enriched Thy Country more,
Then all the Traffiquers for Indian Ore:
As Boas did, His Family o'resee,
Thy Beasts were fatned by the Masters eye:
In whose affairs were nothing wrong that went,
Whom Tenants, Servants, ever may lament.
Bragged not of Blood, as many nowadays,
Though from Mcduff (Fifes Thane) Thine did arise.
In Matching, and Alliance did digress
Never from the splendour of his worthiness:
Sad Pryzless loss to Name, (its ancient Chief)
Thereto show friendship beyond all belief;
As Scripture tells, Joseph of Husbands best,
And Isaac the most loving do attest,
Of Noble Wemys, may future times record,
The best of Husbands, and most loving Lord:
Thy Deathless Praise spread through the Univers,
(As is Thy Merit) can no Pen express;
Full sixty nine years luster lent this Clyme,
In all whose Days, most Peaceful, free of Crime;
Hence called to Heaven, David Earl of Wemyss, Anagram,
to have eternal Rule,
