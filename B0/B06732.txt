The Wandering Jew; OR, The Shoemaker of Ierusam, w^o lived when our Savior
Christ was crucified, and appointed by him to live until his coming again.
To the tune of, The Ladies Fall.


WHen as in fair Jerusalem
our Savior Christ did live,
And for the sins of all the world,
his own dear life did give;
The wicked Jews with scoffs and scorns
did daily him molest,
That never till he left his life,
out Savior could have rest.
When they had crowned his head with thorns,
and scourged him in disgrace,
In scornful sort they led him forth
unto his dying place,
Where thousand thousands in the street
beheld him pass along,
Yet not one gentle heart was there
that pitied thus his wrong.
Both old and young reviled him,
as in the streets he went,
And nothing found but churlish taunts,
by every ones consent:
His own dear Cross he bore himself,
a burden far too great,
Which made him in the streets to faint,
and blood and water sweat.
Being weary, thus he sought to rest
and ^ase his burdened Soul
Upon a stone, the which a wretch
did churlishly control;
And said away thou King of Jews,
thou shall not rest thee here,
Pass o^, thy execution place
thou see now draws near.
And hereupon he thrust him thence,
at which our Savior said
I sure will rest, but thou shall walk,
and have no journey staid:
With that this cursed Shoemaker,
for offering Christ this wrong.
Left Wife and Children house and all,
and went from thence along.
Where after he had seen the blood
of Jesus Christ thus shed,
And to the Cross his body nayld,
away with speed he fled,
Without returning back again
unto his dwelling place,
But wandering up and down the world,
a runnagate most base.
The Second part;
to the same tune.
NO resting could he find at all,
no ease of hearts content,
No house, no home nor byding place,
but wandering forth he went,
From Town to Town in foreign Lands
with grieved Conscience still,
Repenting sore the heinous guilt
of his fore-passed ill.
Thus after some few Ages past,
in wandering up and down,
He much again desired to see
Jerusalems renown:
But finding it all quite destroyed,
he wandered thence with woe,
Our Saviors words which he had spoke
to verify and show.
I Will rest (says he) but thou shall walk,
so does this wandering Jew
From place to place, but cannot stay,
for seeking Countries new:
Declaring still the power of him,
whereas he comes and goes,
And of all things done in the East
since Christ his death, he shows.
The world he has half compast round,
and seen those Nations strange,
That hearing of the Name of Christ,
their Idol gods do change:
To whom he has told wondrous things,
of times fore-past and gone,
And to the Princes of the world
declares his cause of moan;
Desiring still to be dissolved,
and yield his mortal breath:
But yet the Lord has thus decreed,
he shall not yet see death;
For neither looks he old or young,
but as he did those times
When Christ did suffer on the Cross
for mortal sinners Crimes.
He passed many a foreign place,
Arabia, Egypt, Africa,
Grecia, Syria, and great Thrace,
and through all Hungaria:
Where Paul and Peter preached Christ,
those blessed Apostles de^re;
Where he has told our Saviors words
in Countries far and near.
And lately in Bohemia,
with many a German Town,
And now in Flanders, as is thought,
he wandreth up and down:
Where learned men with him confers,
of these his lingering ^ayes
And wondering much to hear him tell
his journeys and his ways.
If people gives this Jew an Alms,
the most that he will take
Is not above a Groat a time,
which he for Jesus sake
Will kindly give unto the poor,
and thereof make no spare,
Affirming still, that Jesus Christ
of him has daily care.
He nere was seen to langh nor smile,
but weep and make great moan,
Lamenting still his miseries,
and days for-past and gone.
If he heard any one blaspheme,
and take Gods Name in vain,
He tells them that they crucify
their Master Christ again.
If you had seen him dye, says he,
as these mine eyes have done,
Ten thousand times a day would ye
his torments think upon,
And suffer for his sake all pains,
all torments, and all woes;
These are his words, and this his life,
whereas he comes and goes.
FINIS.
