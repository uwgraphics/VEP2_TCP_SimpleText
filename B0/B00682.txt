^^t long ago as I allone did walk,
Intill ane place was plesand to behauld:

(...) ^^derstuid their sentence quhat they wald,

^^^ine the Queen and aganis her husband:
^^^^t they not weill ilk ane in his awin land

^^^^ing his awin as him had lykit best.
^o quhome Philandrius did answer make,
(...) said that men war not deuyst only:
^^^^^ut all cair their awin pleasure to tak,
^^t to foirse the weill of that country
^^^laris of quhilk, the Lord will that they be
^^hilk charge (he sayis) they cannot weill refuse,
(...) ^^hamefullie their office they abuse.
^ehalding than the actis execrabill,

(...) ^^^ame the lack the bruit abhominabill:
^^^t saikles men with sorrow did sustene.
(...) private heart it mycht prik up with tene,
^o seik redres and mend that cairfull caice
(...) mair the nobillis of the Royal raice.
To se the King first lychtlit schamefully,
and not chereist in chalmer nor in hall:
^^^e murdreist down causeles and crewelly,
Off that tresoun na trial taine at all.
^^^y whom the bruit did trewlie traytouris call,
Greitest in Co^^t and chereist all their best,
(...) Lordis heart cuid lui^ on this and lest*
To se ane monstuire full of fylthynes,
Abone the rest heich mountit up in gloir
^^^h Prince and Realm and all power posses.
^ne gled ay gaipand guide men to deuoir,
^^hat heart sa hard bot this sycht sold make soir,
^uha rychtly than dar their men reprehend:
(...) greit mischief quha menis till amend.
To se the Queen forth rydand on the plain,
Reft like ane huire with ruffians shamefullie,
(...) thocht that sum think that was bot ane train,
^^r awin writing dois contrar testify,
(...) ^rance Ingland and money strange cuntrie:
Pleineand that syd was rauyssit by her will
^^^at Nobill heart mycht se this and sit still.
To reif, to murder and wyle licherie,
The fourt for fault is eikit euin fra hand:
(...) testify that Law and honesty
With sic ribaldis can not ring in ane land*
(...) Queen is cuplit with ane wyffis husband
And farther it he quha the King did sack,
(...) law the Queen dar into marriage tak.
^^7s;yde all this their durst na virtuous wycht,
In presence of that proud tyran appeir:
^^^dy boucheouris and throtcutters on nycht,
War only hard, and only had the steir.
(...) Nobill men durst not the Court cum neir,
^he royal house refuge to honest men*
^^s maid ane bordell and ane theifis den.
Our pretty Prince the peirle of all this land,
With duilfull d^^d they socht for to deuoir:
^^^t rich relick and thresour of Scotland,
Destroy as they his father did befoir.
^^hat duilfull mind mycht dawlie this deploir,
^n sic dainger to se that innocent
(...) our releif quhome God had till us sent.
^^hat Nobill heart could langer this induire?
Quhat commoun breist did not for sorrow burst?
Quhat godly man of him self could be suire?
Quhat stranger thocht bot this cuntrie was cursed
Quhat preachour this repreif, I pray ow durst?
Quhat chaist woman wyssit not to be deid,
To se sic vice set up in vertewis steid.
Gif it was sa, than quha can worthylie
Exalt and prais, and magnify the Name
Off their Nobillis quha durst courageously
Hazaird them self to saif us all fra shame.
Their laud, their honor, and tryumphand fame,
Salbe dispersed in dispyte of Inuy,
Quhen faceles fuillis sall ^^t be settin by.
Erid^^lus than (...) maid again,
Thy talk he sayis is tr^uth and verity:
Bot it sum douts their is of quhilk rycht feign,
Gif laser lat I would resoluit be,
And first tuiching the Quenis liberty:
For money thinkis their Barronis ar to bauld,
In strait keeping a Princes for to hauld.
Philandrius to answer than him sped,
And this he said Eridielus until:
Gif that a friend with fayis away war led
Be wickit craft syne tystit war till ill.
Thocht he covet in that stait to bide still,
it in that caice his freindis of dewtie
Sold wis his weill and seik his liberty.
And gif his fantasy was so far infectit,
That to the treuth he could not bent his eir:
He sold not be in folly it neglectit
Bot fairnes than sold mixit be with feir,
And gif all this could him na wisdom leir
Than acht he be of all puissance denude,
To do na evil gif he could do na good.
Than sen that bowdin bludy beist Bothwell,
Hes traitorously in myrk put down our King:
His wife the Queen syne rauyssit to him sell,
In fylthie lust throw color of wedding.
Thocht sho be witcheit wald in ruttery ring,
The Nobillis sold nether of their enduire,
That lowne to leif, nor her to be his huire.
And gif the poysone in her heart be sonkin,
That sho will not consent he puneist be:
Gif with his fylthie lust (...) ^e (...) dronkin,
That sho foret office (...) honesty
Than man her Nobillis of necessity,
Cut of her force quhill tresoun be reuengeit,
And this confusioun in ane ordour changeit.
In private persounis sayis Eridielus,
I understand thy taill is true in deid:
Bot in Princes it is mair perrillous,
And few examplis thairof can I reid.
And in sic caice the subiectis all had neid,
Haill to concur with ane authority
Sic concurrence in Scotland naue I se.
Philandrius sayis brother than considder,
How first began all dominatiounis:
Quhen ruid pepill assemblit them togidder
And maid their Kingis be creatiounis*
In votis than war variatiounis,
I trow rycht few was chosin be the haill,
Bot he was King quhais pairtie did preuaill.
Wycht sa gif Princes sa them self abuse,
That of force subiectis man put to their hand:
Guide men sold not than to reform refuse,
Thocht all at ainis concur not on their band.
Naimly gif Justice on their party stand,
And may consent gis quha wald rackin rycht,
Sen God hes gein to them both stre^th and mycht.
ea thocht it war ane King for to depose,
For certain crymi^ I think the subiectis may,
Or fylthy faultouris fast in prisone close,
Rather than lat ane haill country decay.
They sold nor stir thocht sum men wald say nay
To ane purpose the haill will never conclude,
They have aneuch, hes force and quarrel good.
May they not put ane ordoure to the heid:
Quha in beginning did the heid up make
May they not set ane better in the steid,
Gif it fra vice can not be callit bak.
Les this be done Realms will ga to wrak,
Namely quhen that the crime is sa patent
That nouther misters Judge nor argument.
As gif ane King his pepill wald betray,
And him and them both bring to servitude*
He sold in this reformit be I say,
Naimly be Nobillis and be men of good.
The Baliols cause considdir how it stude,
Quhat rycht had Robert Bruice him to expel?
Because to Ingland he subject him sell.
And now gif I durst speik without respect,
To huirmaisters, to murderers of Kingis:
To throtcutters our Realm was maid subject,
Quha in their malice proudely it malingis.
Lat Nobill hartis considder ^ll their thingis,
They sall weill find that this puire natioun,
Greit mister had of reformatioun.
Sic fylthie lust in Sardanapalus,
Sic cruelty in Nero did not ring:
Sic brutishe life in Heliogabalus
Sic traitor mind to slay his Lord and King.
In feineit Phocas breist did never spring:
Sic beistly bowgrie Sodom hes not seen
As rang in him quha rewlit Realm and Queen.
And sold the Nobill Barronis of this land
In boilis lurk and this mischief behauld,
Quhair is the wittis wont to reule Scotland:
Go reid the buik, repeit the storyis auld,
King Euenus was keipit in strange hauld
And deit their Conarus was inclosit,
First being dewlie for his fault deposit.
For wickit life imprisont was Ferquhaird,
Quha slew him self of proud melancholy,
Donald the fyft he gat the same reuaird:
And Ethus did in prisone private die.
And gif e list to go fra this country,
In every land examplis dois abound
Gif they be socht they may be eithlie found.
For sic misordour proud Tarquinius
Was the last King that ever did ring in Rome,
For like crimes the tyran Claudius:
Losit his stait and gat deid for his dome,
To speik of Nero now I have na to me
Off Commodus, Caius and Caracall,
It war to lang for to discriue the fall.
Quhat sorrow into Naples than was seen,
Quha knawis the story cleirly their may reid,
Quhen Charlis dochter Ieane that catiue Queen:
Both honesty foret and womanheid.
Her husband and her cousing put to deid,
Syne with his Burrio band ane new marriage,
Allace this sample seruis over weill our age.
And it the Lord he leit her not eschaip,
Bot of her tuik ane punishment conding:
Quha first her husband hangit in ane raip,
The murderer syne in his bed did bring.
God maid her pain aggre with her guyding,
An bedfoly to sic mischief her led
Euin so sho endit smorit with a bed.
Thou to conclude their Nobillis dois bot rycht,
Gif they the Queen keip still in sicker gaird,
Until that coward Kingslayar on nycht
For his demeritis get ane just rewaird*
Than lat them all concur both Lord and Lord,
Their Realm and Queen with guide cousall to guide
Settand all private profit far a side
Gif they do this than dar I say ane thing,
Their laud and fame sall move above the skyis,
Their heich renoune sall in all Regioun ring:
Their name sall gang quhair ever the Sone do rise,
They salbe repuite hardy wycht and wise,
In all storyis they salbe cleirly kend,
The Leuing Lord bring them to this good end.
As this Philandrius did freely talk,
The the other pairt Erideilus be name,
Raise up and quyetlie away did s^alk
And as me thocht he waxit reid for schame,
Quhilk quhen I saw I raise up and come hame
And put in wryt their disputatioun,
As e have hard be this narratioun.
FINIS.
