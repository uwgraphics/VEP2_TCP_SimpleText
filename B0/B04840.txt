A PROPHECY Excerpted out of PARAEUS on the Apocalipse, Chapter 17: 5. found in an
ancient M. S. in the House of the Abbot of Salezum.
Translated into English.
THERE shall arise a KING out of the most Illustrious Family of the Lilie,
having a long Forehead, high Eyelids, long Eyes, an Eagles Nose; he shall
gather a great Army, and destroy all the Tyrants of his Kingdom, and shall
strick with Death, all flying, hyding themselves in the Mountains and Caverns
from his Face: For as the Bridegroom is joined to the Bride, so shall Justice
be to him. With them he shall wage War until the fourtieth Year, subduing the
Islanders, Spaniards and Italians, he shall destroy Rome and Florence, and burn
them with Fire, Salt may be sowed upon that Land. The highest of the Clergy who
have invaded Peter's Chair he shall strike by Death, and in the same Year he
shall obtain a double Crown, passing over the utmost Sea with a great Army, he
shall enter Greece, and shall be called King of the Graecians. He shall subdue
the Turks and Barbarians, by making an Edict, Whosoever shall not adore the
Crucified One, shall die the Death, and there is none that shall be able to
resist him, because an holy Army from the LORD shall be with him, and he shall
obtain the Dominion of the Earth. These things being done, he shall be called
the Rest of the holy Christians.

Psalm. 72.
The End.
