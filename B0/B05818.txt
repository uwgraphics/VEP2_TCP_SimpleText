The Saylors departure from his dearest Love,
Wishing that still (to him) she would constant prove
She (in the second part) does thus reply,
E're she would from him depart, she will choose to dye.

To a new Tune of, Adieu my pretty one.




NOw I am bound to the Seas,
and from my love must part,
May ought my dear displease,
that lies so near my heart:
Nor mourn my sweet for me,
to perturpate thy mind,
Since there no help can be,
I must leave thee behind.
Remember me on shore,
as I the on the main,
So keep my love in store,
till I return again.
Poor Saylors must endure,
the storms of Boreas blast;
Of life no man is sure,
while Seas raging last:
But when the storms are over,
that wind and tide serves well,
We have to kiss the shore,
where our true Lovers dwell:
Remember, etc.
When we are landed there,
and come to greet our friends,
Strange wonders we declare,
how God us save defends:
Then Love (if thou please,
pray still for my success,
And prosperous Gate at Seas
to shield us from distress,
Remember, etc.
Our shipping shall be built,
without the help of Tree,
The hardest flint shall melt,
e're I prove false to thee:
And though I be enforced,
to part thy company,
My love bides indivorc'd,
and shall do till I dye.
Remember, etc.
The fire shall freeze by kind,
the Snow shall flaming burn,
The rain shall turn to wind,
or e're my love return:
Young Men and Maidens all,
that live in England wide,
To witness I you call,
how firm my love shall bide:
Remember, etc.
The Mountains high shall fall,
beneath the valleys deep,
E're I prove false at all,
my promise so i will keep:
And if I hold not true,
to thee my gentle Dove,
Let not my eyes e're view,
Earth, Air, or Heaven above:
Remember, etc.
The Fish shall seem to fly,
yea, Birds to fishes turn,
The Sea be ever dry,
and fire cease to burn:
When I prove false to thee,
shall these things come to pass,
But that will never be,
no nor so never was:
Remember, etc.
Let not deluding tongue,
bereave me of my love,
Nor (sweet) do me such wrong,
least it my death should prove:
Thou see I must away,
our Ship lies under sail,
And time for none will stay,
God sends a happy Gale:
Remember me on shore,
as I thee on the main,
So keep my Love in store;
till I return again.





Her Answer. MVst thou depart my dear,
and leave me thus alone,
'Twill cost me many a tear,
though to thee it be unknown:
But be assured i will pray,
unto the powers Divine,
To prosper thee the way,
where fate shall now design:
While I remember thee,
and keep my love in store,
Do thou the like to me,
on Sea, or on the shore.
O till thou do return,
from of the Ocean main,
Full often I shall mourn,
in a lamenting strain,
And when fierce winds arise,
or but contrary blow,
My sighs and watery eyes,
shall sympathize my woe:
Then i will remember, etc.
Each hour shall seem to me,
in length (at least) a year,
Till thy return again,
my joys are filled with fear,
For on the Sea I know,
what sundry dangers be,
Rock, Sands, and many a Foe,
from which Lord keep thee free,
Thus i will remember, etc.
I would I might but sail,
t^rough surging seas with thee,
My heart would never fail,
while thou art near to me,
Or that I could but hear,
thy voice, I should be well,
But thou wilt not be so near,
to hear or see thy Nell:
Yet i will, etc.
Though loath we be to part,
yet since it seems we must,
To Sea bear thou my heart
with whom it is put in trust:
And thine with me let rest,
till thou retur'st again,
And each he doubly blessed,
by making one of twain:
So i will remember, etc.
Mean while, my only joy,
i will kiss thee lovingly;
Our hopes does time destroy,
would I could him deny:
But time will comfort bring,
though we are at time crossed;
And Winter finds a Spring,
restored what seemed lost:
Yet i will, etc.

Man. Farewell my love, farewell,
ten thousands times adieu,
My witty pretty Nell,
till my return to you,

Maid. Farewell to thee sweet-heat
that now to Sea art gone,
With that great grief I part,
to Lovers best it is known:
Yet i will remember thee, etc.

FINIS.
