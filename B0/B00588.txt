The woeful Lamentation of William Purcas, who for murtherin his Mother at
Thaxted in Essex was executed at Chelmsford.
To the tune of, The rich Merchant.


THe Swan before her death,
most pleasantly does sing:
But I a heavy hearted note
with tears my hands do wring,
With tears my hands do wring,
yet not a tear for death;
For I am weary of my life,
desiring loss of breath.
No fears for death I shed,
but for my sins I mourn;
Oh, for that sin that makes me wish,
I never had been borne,
I never had been borne,
mercy good Lord I crave:
Oh would my mothers tender womb,
had been my timelesse grave.
Ah me, that very word
strikes through my wounded heart,
The name of Mother (oh my soul)
does aggravate my smart,
Does aggravate my smart,
and much increase my woe,
Never villain did so vile a deed
as I have done, I know.
Oh now (alas) I know,
but now (alas) too late,
Drink then deprived me of my sense,
and of my humane state.
Oh, that detested Vice
is that we should detest,
A thousand thousand times I curse,
though once I loved it best.
Yea, once I loved it well,
oh, too too well indeed:
For that I did in drink ore-gone,
my woe-tyr'd soul does bleed.
For this foul spotted fault,
my mother many a time
Would gently chide me, and would wish
me leave this loathed crime.
She Would tell me 'twas a sin
that many sins did feed,
As swearing, whoring, and such like,
and true she said indeed.
With tears she often did say,
a wicked end 'twill have,
Therefore my son do thou take heed,
take heed of it I crave.
With heavy heart she thus
would seem to turn my mind,
But slightly I Would regard her words,
which now too true I find.
Her Honey words to me
more bitter were than gall;
I took her for my foe, when she
was most my friend of all.
She Would speak to me in love,
I Would answer her in rage,
Without all fear or reverence
of title, or of age.
Thus often with words we would part,
till good with bad I crossed*
But at the last, in drinking rage
my wit and sense I lost.
Her words I would not hear,
in rage I drew my knife,
To take dear life away from her,
by whom I had my life.
The sight of which did make
her heart much sorrow feel:
(Then as I should have done to her)
she unto me did kneel,
And on her knees did beg,
that I her life would spare,
And 'twere but for my soul, on which
she prayed me have a care:
Oh spare me, son, she said,
forget not who I am,
Thy aged Mother do not then
thy ears against me dam.
Alas, how can thou, son,
endure to see me kneel,
And beg and weep and wring my hands,
and no compassion feel?
For telling thee thy fault,
and wishing thee to leave,
I pray thee do not desperately
me of my life bereave.
Thus kneeling would she beg,
and begging, weep apace;
And weeping, she would wring her hands,
in lamentable case.
Yet nothing was I moved
with all her piteous moan,
My heart for her did feel no grief,
but was as hard as stone.
The second part.
To the same tune.


THus stubborn did I stand,
against my Mother dear:
This second Part, the bloody part,
discoursed you shall hear.
Now, now, oh now again,
full heavily I sing;
And in relation of my woe,
both heart and hands I wring:
For that I now shall tell,
will draw forth brinish tears
From any that have humane hearts,
or my laments that hears.
Her kind entreats I crossed,
with bitter words and oaths,
Such as the wicked love to hear,
such as the virtuous loathes.
And after all these wandering words,
with Hels prepared knife,
I quickly wounded her to death,
from whom I had my life.
Vi^e Nero (I have read)
his Mother ripped to see
The place where he an Embrion lay;
O foul impiety!
Yet none more vile than this,
than this that I have done;
Oh, never did there ever live
so impious a son.
Cain branded was a Slave,
for murdering of his Brother;
Oh, what am I then, what am I,
for murdering of my Mother?
Aye me, my Mother ^eare,
that bitter names did prove
In bearing me, and ever since
full dearly did me love.
Full dearly did me love,
as any Mother could:
And careful was she still for me,
as any Mother should.
Her best in all she did,
still working for my good:
Yet all her pain and care I quit,
with shedding of her blood.
With shedding of her blood,
her kindness I did quit,
By the Devil goaded on to do it,
even in my drunken fit.
All you that take delight
in this abhorred Vice,
The end of it come find of me,
and learn to be more wise.
This stains my soul as much
as any sin of seven,
That blacks she soul, that we should keep
most fair and fit for Heaven.
So long is a man a man,
as Reason he retains:
But Reason gone, he is no man,
that shape's but little gains.
If man be then no man,
when Reason is away,
Man is no man when he is drunk,
for Drink does Reason sway.
O, what is a Drunkard then,
of Reason dispossessed!
As other creatures reasonlesse,
he is a brutish Beast.
And thus by me take heed
of Drunkenness (I end.)
O fly this Vice, and see what sins
do not this Vice attend.
For that I did in drink,
now I am here to dye:
Ten thousand deaths I have deserved*
for this impiety.
Thus sorry for my sin,
I pray that all may mend:
And Christ I pray receive my soul,
after my shameful end.
FINIS.
