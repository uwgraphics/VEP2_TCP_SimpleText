The Young-Mans A. B. C.
Or, Two Dozen of Verses which a Young Man sent his Love, who proved unkind.
The Tune is, The Young-mans A. B. C.


ACcept, dear love, these
shadows of my grief,
And let thy pity yield
me some relief!
A Captive to thy will
I must remain;
For thou art only she
must ease my pain.
BE kind to me as I am
kind to thee;
^last not thy fame,
with cruelty to me:
but let thy inward parts thy
features grace,
beauty in heart ado^ns
the outward face.
COnsider how my
service has been bent
Continually to gain
thy sweet content:
Can thou, my Dear
be so obdure to me?
Cross unto him that
is so true to thee.
DEfer no time to
understand my grief,
but with some speed
come ease me with relief:
Thy beauty rare has
struck my heart so deep,
That all my days I
mean to wail and weep.
EXcept thou d^st some
favor to me yield,
I shall be sla^n with
love in Venu^ field:
I am so discontent in
mind and heart,
That neither means
nor time can cure my smart.
FOrget thou not the
woe wherein I dwell,
My torments do all
all other griefs excel;
Consider well my woeful
sable nights,
and days I spend away
without delights.
GRant me thy love to
mitigate my pain,
The like thou shall
receive from me again.
So love will we as
does the turtle-dove,
^^ose firm affection
ever constant prove.
HAve you respect on this
the grief I take,
Which out of sleep
does sometimes me awake;
In Dreams I see that
which I most desire;
But waking sets
my senses all on fire.
IN doleful sort these
words I now relate,
which makes me think
my self unfortunate;
To set my heart where
I had naught but scorn,
which makes me rue
the time that I was born
KIll me not in this
desperation deep,
To think how I neither
eat, nor drink, nor sleep;
To think of that which
I cannot obtain,
The which has near
my heart with sorrow slain.
LEt tender pity move thy
gentle heart,
And so from thee
my love shall never start,
To gain thy love
i will venture life and limb,
And for thy sake the
Ocean I will swim.
MY life I loath because
my woes increase,
Therefore my to^ments cease
and me release:
then be not harsh whereas
thou would be kind,
but for my love
let me no hatred find.
NEither deny to grant
me this request,
Nor seek thou not to
work me more unrest,
For if you do the
wo^st share full to thine.
the worse can come
ends but one life of mine.
OH that thou would but
now conceive aright,
then would my darkness soon
be turned to light:
My greatest sorrows
I should then destroy
And all my grief and care
exchange to joy.
PIerce then no deeper
to my bleeding heart,
The which is ready
now for to depart:
He still that loves and
is not loved again,
Had better die than
still to live in pain
QUench thou the flames
of this my burning breast,
which for thy sake
no time nor tide can rest:
My love to thee has
evermore been true,
Therefore the same
see that I have from you.
REgard my grief how
still it more exceeds,
My life is like the Herb
that is spoiled with weeds:
Among the finest wheat
the tares do grow,
And thou my love has
wrought my overthrow.
SVVeet love now take on me
thy friend, some care,
Regard my grief that
still lives in despair
Of thy true love, which
is more dear than gold;
My griefs are more
than numbers can be told.
TOo long I Have lived and
yet too late repent,
For why the glory
of my life is spent;
In loving her that
never did love me,
O then what day
of pleasure can I see?
WOuld I had never
lived thy face to have seen,
O then full happy surely
had I been,
For never any one
under the Sun,
But thou alone,
could me this wrong done.
X Thousand times
more cruel is thy mind,
Then Heathens, Jews,
or Turks are in their kind
Or any one that
on the earth does go,
And woe is me,
for I have found it so.
YEt if thy mind be
so perversely bent,
That nothing can
procure my hearts content,
Know this from me,
that I have learned of late,
No more to dote on her
that does me hate.
ZEnobia to Tamberlain
never was
More dear than thou
to me, but now alas!
I and my toil, my sighs
and sobs in vain,
Why should I love,
and not be loved again?
and Now to set a
period to my woe,
If thou will have me,
prithee tell me so:
if otherwise thou mean,
thy mind it send,
Resolve me off ^^on,
and there is an end.
