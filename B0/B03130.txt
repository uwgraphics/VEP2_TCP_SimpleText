Old Erra Pater, or his rambling Ghost,
Prognosticating of this long strong frost,
Some Ages past, Said, yt ye Ice-bound Thames
Should prove a Theater for Sports and Games
Her Watr'y Green be turned into a Bare,
For Men a City seem, for Booths a Fair;
And now this Straggling Sprite is once more come
To Visit Mortals and foretell their doom:
When Maids grow modest ye Dissenting Crew
Become all Loyal, the Falsehearted true,
Then you may probably, and not til then
Expect in England such a Frost ^ again.
Printed for James Norris at the Kings arms with: out Temple Bar
