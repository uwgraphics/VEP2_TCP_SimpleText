The true Lovers Happiness Or, Nothing venture, Nothing have.
Showing how an Apprentice made bold to court his Masters Daughter, got her
good will, and married her unknown to her Parents yet afterward her father
seeing they loved each other so entirely, he gave them a considerable portion
of money to set up with, and now they live in a happy condition; this may serve
for a pattern for others.

Their complements to you I will rehearse.
According as they are printed down in verse.
Tune of Amyntas on the new-made Hay, or Loyal Lovers.




Man. OH my Dearest come away,
and hearken what thy love does say
As I am here I vow and swear
I kindly will embrace thee;
Thou need not fear my only dear
that I shall ever disgrace thee.
I Will be as honest as the day,
thy virtues I will not bewray,
No face alive shall e're deprive
me of my dearest jewel,
If thou deny I sure shall dye,
then ve not thou so cruel.
many years I loved thee,
therefore dearest pity me,
Thy very frown does cast me down,
thy smiles again revive me:
Thou have my heart where'r thou art
then don't of love d^prive me.

Maid. O fle thou simple Prentice boy,
how durst thou with me tick and toy,
Or be so bold this to unfold
unto thy mastes Daughter.
If he should know, 'twould breed thy woe
then what will follow after.




I am my Fathers own delight
This you may understand aright,
No Daughter he has else but me,
which makes him highly prize me;
Therefore be mute, leave off thy suit
I friendly do advise thee.
My Fathers anger pray you shun,
Least you are utterly undone,
The prison-grate will be your fate,
if you run such adventures,
Besides all this, if maids you kiss
you forfeit your indentures.

Man. Prithee dearest do not flout,
At Easter next my time is out,
And then I swear I will not care
for master nor such Histories:
But a wife i will have my life to sa^e,
and you are my only mistress.
Blame me not for saying so,
For love will creep where it cannot go
Had I not spoke, my heart had broke
I could endure no longer:
Though I did fight both day and night
yet Cupid grew the stronger.
Me thinks I see thy lovely face
As I do walk in any place,
Thy crystal eyes where Cupid lies,
thy cheeks are like to Roses:
Thy lips are sweet, when as we meet
all virtue there incloses.
Though I am poor and thou art rich
Slight me not I thee beseech,
You know my trade will keep a maid
as well as yeoman Jarvis,
If I get Pearl my dearest Girl,
it shall be at thy service.

Maid. Thy speeches I do much commend,
Yet dare I not to condescend
For fear I lose as I suppose,
my fathers dear affection.
Or else i would yield to you the field,
if I might have my election.

Man. Never stand to complement,
This does give me no content,
Though father frown and mother frown,
yet none of them shall rout me,
I am not in jest I do protest
I cannot live without thee.

Thus he gained the Damsels love,
And honest to her he did prove,
He wedded her and bedded her
although his Master's Daughter;
He pleased her well t^truth to tell,
and parents love came after.
For they gave them eightscore pound
whereby this couples joys were crowned
Thus may you see in each degree
this youth was well be-friended,
They live in peace, their goods increase
and thus my Song is ended.
