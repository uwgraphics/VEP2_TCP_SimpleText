The humble Remonstrance of the Commission of the General Assembly; Unto the
Honorable and high Court of Parliament.
Right Honorable,
IT is unto us the servants of Jesus Christ, and your servants for his sake, no
small consolation; That whilst this Land lies afflicted, and almost fainting
under a burden of many evils, you are assembled for her help; Promising unto
our selves, that as in your own hearts ye do bewail its misery before God, So
you will gladly entertain the representation thereof from all its lovers; and
from the sense of your interest and trust, with spirits as large as your
places, endeavor to repair our ruins and build up our breaches; Therefore,
as many Synods and Presbyteries do now make their humble address unto your
Lordships, in their several supplications, concerning the interests of
Religion and of the Kingdom, So are we bold to pour forth our presons
thoughts and desires into your bosom, hoping that as they flow from no other
fountain the the discharge of our consciences and a purpose no do good, So
your Lordships will allow them that acceptance that beseems the justice and
wisdom of so High and Honorable a Court, and improve the same as far as you
see reason, for the honor of God, and safety both of Church and State. If we
had forgotten the sad effects of the Lords former indignation, or were not
sensible of the present tokens of his wrath, we were more then stupide; There
was a time wherein the Lord made us flee before the Enemy, and made us drunk
with the wine of astonishment, not finding either hearts to resolve or hands to
execute and put in practice: Neither was the Pestilence less violent in our
cities then the sword in the fields; Many thousands have fallen in our land by
the arrows of the Almighty and fury of the most high, and yet his wrath is not
turned away but his hand stretched out still: The flame of his indignation does
again burn hotly in some of our cities, and a considerable part of our Country
groans and languishes without help, under all the cruelty of a barbarous
Enemy, who makes no other use of your offer of pardon, then to despise your
power, and to wax more insolent in acting of their mischievous designs, which
reach not only unto our Lives and Liberties, but unto our Religion and Souls
themselves; how sore is the Lord displeased when he suffers Antichrist to enter
in our borders, and his emissaries to lead our brethren captive into Babylon
and set up the Mass amongst them? and what can we take this for, but a sad
prognostication of ensuing darkness to those who have not walked worthy of the
light, and that the Lord threatens to depart from his Temple? and is it not an
eminent token of his anger, that many who have made themselves drunk with the
blood, and rich with the spoils of thousands of our dear Brethren, after that
they were destinate unto death by your selves, have yet escaped the hand of
justice, and are restored unto their Lives and Fortunes, unto the strengthening
of the Malignant party, and discouraging the hearts and weakening the hands of
all the well-affected in the land? It is bitter as death to live with these
that have slain the Lords people, and to hear them boast of their cruelty, and
rejoice in their iniquity, every day insulting over the Cause of God, and
despising and studying to tread under-foot all the lovers of the same. Neither
can we look upon the insolences and oppression of many in our Armies, under
which not a few in our Land groans; But as upon the rod of the Lords fury,
turning the means of our health and preservation unto a cup of vinegar and
gall that sets the teeth on edge: Those calamities, and whatsomever miseries
besides do afflict us, can issue from no other fountain then from that deluge
of profanitie that has covered the face of the Land, which accreses unto a
great height of guiltiness, because we have sinned in the day of the Gospel,
and despised the Oath of God, neither regarding our Covenant, nor the operation
of his hands, in which he has made himself glorious in the midst of us, in
many most eminent works both of Mercy and of Justice.

We acknowledge that the work of Reformation has not been without plenty of
most gracious and comfortable fruits in many souls throughout the Land, who
are for a testimony unto the truth, and for a name of joy and praise unto the
most High; Yet we cannot but bemone the power of ungodlines that prevails and
breaks forth in many gross sins, unto the violation of our Covenant, the
reproach of our Cause, and the great dishonor of the holy One of Israel our
Savior, whose mercies toward us calls upon us to be holy in all manner of
conversation, and to be fruitful in every good work, that we may adorn the
Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord, and not make his enemies to blaspheme.
Therefore knowing all other cures to be vain without the study of Reformation,
We do from the unfeigned zeal of your prosperity and peace, in the bowels of
the Lord Jesus Christ, by whose blood we have been redeemed, in much tender
and humble affection, with tears, exhort you by all your Oaths and Obligations
unto God, by all his mercies and deliverances toward you, by all your zeal of
his Honor and love to Religion and Country, that you will in all your
conversation, study Sobriety, Righteousness and Holiness, and so to walk in
the Gospel, that it may be known that the Son of God raigns in your hearts,
when you not only hold forth his virtues in your selves, but discountenance
every profane person, and cherish and embrace all those that bear the Image of
God; The example of your good conversation cannot but be of great force to all
the Land, and nothing will contribute more for repressing of sin or
establishing of holiness, then the precedencie of great ones, Ordering all
things that concerns themselves and their followers and domestics according to
the Covenant; as is the frame of man's spirits and tennor of their conversation
in private, such is their deportment and carriage in public actions. We do
well know that nothing will be so effectual for enabling your Honors in the
integrity of your spirits, with much affection and love one toward another
without emulation or self-seeking, faithfully and zealouslie to act public
counsels and resolutions, then for each of you to walk with God, who is the
Father of light, and the Author of every good gift and perfect donation. But it
is chiefly as you are clothed with Authority and assembled in Parliament,
that we do now make address unto your Honors, beseeching you by him who
stands in the assembly of gods, That as your Progenitors and you have made
many pious and laudable Acts for punishing of vice, and advancing of virtue, So
ye will see carefully to the execution of the same; And because vice is become
common and strong, that you will lay it seriously to heart, and bestirre your
selves in more then an ordinary way, in thinking upon, and executing all the
best expedients for stopping the sluices of iniquity and impiety, and advancing
Righteousness and Religion; We know no service better beseeming your place,
and more worthy of your pains, that will be more acceptable unto God, or more
profitable for the Commonwealth. next unto Reformation and the Rudie of Pictie
and Godliness amongst out selves, We conceive it most necessary for out good,
to hold fat the Union with our Brethren of England; As the attaining and
establishing of it was long studied by the lovers of Truth and Peace, as that
subsidy that was like to contribute most for the lasting happiness of both
Kingdoms, in regard of all their interests, So has the dissolving of this
been, and is the great design of all the Malignant wits both here and abroad;
Conceiving it the surest way to raise their hopes and ruin our happiness, by
dividing us asunder and dashing us one against another, which we are sure that
you abhor, and will study to avoid, no less in your actions then we do in
our desires: And that as hithertills; you have with much wisdom and
faithfulness, carefully shunned every thing that might produce suspicions or
foster Jealousies, and been deficient in nothing that might strengthen the
confidence of the English Nation in the persuasion of your affection and
integrity to them-wards; So you will still from the same wisdom and
faithfulness, hold fast the League and Covenant betwixt the Kingdoms, as that
which is most conduceable for the safety and security of both; And that you
will by all fair and peaceable means travel with the Parliament of England,
for promoving of the work of Uuniformitie, by establishing of the government of
the Kirk, and all the ordinances of the Son of God in England in their purity
and integrity, that all the clouds of error which are there, may be scattered,
and the beauty of the truth shine brightly in both Lands. And conceiving it to
conduce much for that work, and for the accomplishing our happiness, that His
Majesty should join therein, Therefore as we pour forth our prayers unto God
for him on that behalf, So we hope that your Honors will not be deficient in
continuing to deal with him to subscribe the League and Covenant, that he and
his Subjects being of one mind, he may be happy in his Government, and they in
their obedience. And though the Peace with the Rebels in the fruits and effects
thereof, has neither answered your expectations, nor put an end to the
Kingdoms miseriers, yet we shall only desire, that all such as have been
involved in the Rebellion may be kept from places of public trust, whether
Civil or Military; And that you will take such course with them, in moderating
their power, and regulating their carriage, as that it may be known, that you
put a difference betwixt those that have served God and their Country, and
those that have opposed him in the public Cause; And that your peace may be
peace indeed, and not the foundation of a more lasting War: If it were not
tedious, we could lay it before your Honors what a height of arrogance, and
disdain of authority both Civil and Ecclesiastic, appears in the carriage and
expressions of most of these men, and that not in corners abroad, but publicly
in the chief Cities of the Kingdom, and under your own eyes; And it is yet
more grievous, that such should be familiarly conversed with and countenanced
by these who profess themselves to be for the Lord and his Cause, which evil
is so increased, that excommunicate persons themselves are not avoided.

It wounds us deeply to behold the sufferings, and hear the cries and
complaints of our Brethren in the Province of Argyle, and the places
thereabouts, who have their blood shed, as water spilt upon the ground, their
estates ruined, their houses burnt with fire, and the remnant that is left
exposed unto the snares of Antichrist, and all the miseries of nakedness and
famine: We need not put your Lordships in mind what has been their carriage
and constancy in the public Work, nor what is your obligation unto them by
virtue of your Covenant, Nor how dangerous the seating of such an Enemy there
may be, both unto our Religion and our Country, But we beseech you by the Lord
Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye will apply your selves
seriously, and bestirre your selves diligently for the help and relief of that
poor people, whose conditions pleads for it at your hands, both as an Act of
Justice and an Act of Mercy. We do also lay before you the eminent dangers, and
low condition of our Brethren in Ireland, who are near to be swallowed up of
their adversaries: Persuading our selves, that you will extend your utmost
endeavors with the Parliament of England, for their tymous assistance and
relief. And although we do acknowledge, not only the courage, but also the
moderation and piety of many worthies in our Armies, who not only walk as good
Soldiers, but as Soldiers of Jesus Christ, unto their own commendation and
our hearts joy, whose deservings we make no question will be both valued and
rewarded by you according to their worth; yet we cannot but regrate, that many
in our Armies walk loosly and disorderly, ryotously spending what they
violently spoil, and making the lives of the Commons bitter unto them by their
insolences and oppressions, which are carried with so high an hand, that
without the interposition of your authority, help cannot be found: And
therefore we are confident that your care shall reach unto this also, that the
poor be no more oppressed, nor the Gospel, and our profession reproached by
the debordings of such: And we also trust that your Lordships will so dispose
of common burdens, that friends have no cause to complain of unequal measure
amongst themselves, much less that Enemies are in a better condition then
they, and that they are overcharged when the other not only retain their spoils
but live in superfluities. And because the preservation of the Judicatories of
the Kirk in their integrity and strength is of a great consequence, unto the
suppressing of iniquity and ungodliness, and advancing righteousness and
piety, We desire that your Lordships will carefully see unto the keeping of
their authority inviolable, against all the insolences of unreasonable men:
Our Religion and Liberty are blessings of excellent and incomparable worth, in
establishing of which unto us, the Lord has marched in as glorious and stately
way of providence over all the mountains of opposition, as any eye has seen
for many hundred of years past: And it does not escape your knowledge what has
been the designs and endeavors of adversaries from the beginning against the
same; And though many of them be cut short of their power, that they can no
more openly oppose, yet have they not desisted from their policy secretly to
undermine; And there is no less danger in the mysteries of iniquity then acts
of hostility. When we consider how many of those who were once open Enemies are
brought unto our bosom as seeming friends, we cannot but profess our fears,
and as the watchman of the house of Israel forwarne you of the same; Earnestly
beseeching you, that you will mind the same thing, and as one man from the
unfeigned zeal of the honor of God, and with much love and affection one
toward another, study the preservation of those precious blessings, That not
only this, but the succeeding generations may be happy in the enjoying of the
same.
