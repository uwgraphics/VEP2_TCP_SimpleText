THE SAINT turned SINNER; Or, the Dissenting Parson's Text under the Quaker's
Petticoats.

Tune of a Soldier and a Saylor.
YOU Friends to Reformation,
Give Ear to my Relation,
For I shall now declare Sir,
Before you are aware Sir,
The matter very plain
The matter very plain
A Gospel Cushion thumper,
Who dearly loved a Bumper,
And something else beside Sir,
If he is not belied Sir,
This was a holy Guide Sir,
For the Dissenting Train.
And for to tell you truly,
His Flesh was so unruly
He could not for his Life Sir,
Pass by the Draper's Wife Sir,
The Spirit was so faint.
The Spirit was so faint.
This jolly handsome Quaker,
As he did overtake her,
She made his Mouth to Water,
And thought long to be at her,
Such Sin is no great matter,
Accounted by a Saint.
(Says he) my pretty Creature,
Your charming handsome Feature,
Has set me all on Fire
You know what I desire,
There is no harm in Love.
Quoth she, if that is your Notion,
To Preach up such Devotion,
Such hopeful Guides as you Sir,
Will half the World undo sir,
A Halter is your due sir,
If you such Tricks approve.
The Parson still more eager,
Than lustful Turk or Neger,
Took up her lower Garment,
And said there was no harm in it,
According to the Text,
For Solomon more Wiser,
Than any dull adviser,
Had many Hundred Misses,
And why should such as this is,
Make you so sadly vexed.
The frighted Female Quaker.
Perceived what he would make her,
Was forced to call the Watch in,
And stop what he was hatching,
To spoil the Light within,
To spoil the Light within.
They came to her Assistance,
As she did make Resistance,
Against the Priest and Devil,
The Actors of all Evil,
Who were so grand uncivil,
To tempt a Saint to sin.
The Parson then confounded,
To see himself surrounded,
With Mob and sturdy Watchmen,
Whose Business it is to catch Men,
In leudness with a Punk,
In leudness with a Punk.
He made some faint Excuses,
And all to hide Abuses,
In taking up the Linen,
Against the Saints Opinion,
Within her soft Dominion,
Alleging he was Drunk.
But though he feigned reeling,
They made him pay for feeling,
And Lugg'd him to a Prison,
To bring him to his Reason,
Which he had lost before,
Which he had lost before.
And thus we see how Preachers
That should be Gospel-Teachers,
How they are strangely blinded,
And are so fleshly minded,
Like Carnal Men inclined,
To lie with any Whore.
FINIS.
