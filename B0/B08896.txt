A DECLARATION AND MOTIVE Of the Persons trusted, usually meeting at Salters
Hall in BREADSTREET, to all well affected persons in the several Parishes
within LONDON, and the parts adjacent, for Contributing the value of a Meal
weekly, toward the forming of some Regiments of Volunteers, to be paid during
these times of Danger.
WHereas for better preservation and safeguard of the City, against the
continued desperate practices, and wretched designs of the many Adversaries of
the Peace thereof, visible to every eye not wilfully blinded: The Committee for
the Cities Militia, mindful by all good ways and means, of dischargeing the
trust in them reposed, have by the labor and endeavor of some trusted
Persons, in nature of a Sub-Committee, by them authorized for that purpose,
brought near unto a readiness of Listing and forming diverse Regiments of
Horse and Foot, compounded and made up of honest and well-affected Persons,
Refiants in the City and Neighborhood thereof, under command of known and
trusty Officers, which new Regiments are to be as Auxiliaries to the Trained
Bands, and to be used for defense of Parliament, City, and parts adjacent, as
occasion shall require: And whereas for provision of Horse and Arms, weekly
disciplining of so great listed numbers, and for defraying of other Charges
incident to a service of this nature, and necessary for the carrying on and
perfitting this great Work, so much concerning the preservation of this place,
and therein the safety and well-being of the Parliament and the whole State,
some course must needs be held; and yet that the same may be with the least
trouble and inconveniencie that may be, and with all possible ease and
indifferency; respect being had to the many burdens incumbent upon this City
and disbursements of the same: It is therefore upon due consideration had of
the premises propounded, and as a fit way to effect in some good measure the
aforementioned good intendments, by direction and advice of the said
Sub-Committee, and diverse Reverend Divines, and other worthy Persons known
well-willers and actors for the public; as their joint suite and hearty
request to all well-affected Persons and Families of the City, Suburbs; and
parts adjacent, recommended and desired; That during these times of imminent
and evident dangers, all such Persons and Families sensible of the premises,
and willing to promote their own safety, and the means thereof, will according
to the president begun by those who recommend this, be pleased every of them to
abstain and forbear some one Meal in the Week, and on every Monday (the
first payment beginning on Monday next the eigth of this instant May) pay and
deliver the true value thereof, to the Collectors nominated for their several
Precincts, who are to pay over the same to Treasurers especially entrusted
therewith, of whose accounts and disbursements for the ends aforesaid, exact
care will be taken, which in all probability will be a good way without burden
or difficulty to advance weekly considerable sums for these good uses. And
although this be not imposed but desired and expected as a free will offering
to help on so good a Work, yet it is hoped that none will oppose it, who are
sensible of their own danger, and love their safeties, especially ^f they
consider (amongst many other weighty Reasons which might be rendered.) 1. That
all of every condition are concerned in the Danger, and by Gods blessing in the
Deliverance, and therefore all ought to contribute their proportion toward
their just defense, poor as well as rich being able to allow their shares
herein, for that in effect it takes nothing from their purses. 2. This being no
Fast properly so called, but a Meals voluntary abstinence once a week, is no
more then what we do each week commonly undergo by reason of our other worldly
employments; and therefore such an abstinence for so good a purpose, should not
be thought too strict a performance. 3. There is nothing more equal, or can
less be expected, then that reasonable provision should be made for them that
under God are likely to be the Authors of so great a good for us, and are to
expose their lives to the utmost hazards for defense of us and ours. We add no
other reasons drawn from policy, as the feared Famine, saving of Victuals, or
the like (which with prudent men, and as these times are will be of no small
consideration) but we conclude with this, that the end of our eating and
drinking is but to support and preserve our natural lives, and the end of this
abstinence is not only to preserve our lives and theirs also who adventure for
us, but to preserve to us and them and our posterities, what should be more
dear then all our lives, even Religion (the life of our lives) and our Laws
and Liberties, which no good man will willingly survive, nor wise man doubt,
but that they are sufficiently endangered, if not lie a bleeding; and if the
Parliament and this City (the great maintainers of them) should miscarry
(which God forbid) to all humane judgment are quite lost. It will be therefore
our wisdom before God and man, and our duty too (as we conceive) to further
this, and all other good suggested ways, tending to the preservation of them.
And so we leave the design to Gods blessing, and the consideration of all such
as hereof are made partakers, and are alike with us concerned in the common
safety.


It i^ desired of all the Collectors of the respective Parishes and Precincts,
That for every their Parish and Precinct, they make a Role or Book, and
therein enter the Parishoners and parties names, who agree to make the weekly
contributions before mentioned, desiring such as can write to put down their
own names, and the day of the Month wherein their subscriptions are and the
sum they will please so to pay; and for others, to take their marks, and put
down their names, which may be done under this or the like general form.

We whose names are underwritten, toward the raising, Arming and Disciplining
of certain Regiments of Horse and Foot, raised in London, and the adjacent
places, for the defense thereof and of the Parliament, will freely pay in Money
each Monday, the value of the best ordinary Meals Meat in our Families weekly
(being as follows) during the continuance of the present troubles, and the
Kings distance from his Parliament.
TO appointed Collectors for the Parish or Precinct of (...) by them to be
imparted to the several Househoulders, and others of that Parish or Precinct
as they shall think fit, and receiving the subscription Moneys, thereof to
render an account to the Treasurers for Arms at Salters Hall in Breadstreet
every Wednesday morning weekly, so as the same may be issued for the ends
before mentioned, whereof due care shall be taken by such as are designed by
the Sub-Committee for that purpose, and every person interessed, shall at
pleasure have account thereof.

It is lastly the earnest request of the Sub-Committee, to all the godly
Ministers of those places where this shall be published; That they taking to
their assistance such other willing able persons of their several Precincts,
as will make Conscience to forward this Work, will be pleased by such
Arguments as they shall think fit to use, and the matter it self prompts,
press on the subscriptions desired, and what may more effectually help to
carry on this Work; Is hereby recommended to the Judgments and good
affections of the said Ministers and Collectors, to prepare and put on the
performance of the same, and the reward of their labor will be, that of a good
Conscience, and the issue by Gods blessing the Commonwealths, and therein
their own safeties.
