True Love Requited: Or, The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington.
The young-man's Friends the Maid did scorn,
'Cause she was poor and left forlorn;
They sent the Esquire to London fair,
To be an Apprentice seven year.
And when he out on's time was come,
He met his Love a going home,
And then to end all farther strife,
He took the Maid to be his Wife.
To a North-Country Tune. Or, I have a good old Mother at home.




THere was a youth, and a well-belov'd youth
and he was a Esquires Son,
He loved the Bailiffs daughter dear
that lived in Islington.
She was coy, and she would not believe
that he did love her so;
No, nor at any time she would
any countenance to him show.
But when his friends did understand
his fond and foolish mind,
They sent him up to fair London
an Apprentice for to bind.
And when he had been seven long years
and his Love he had not seen,
Many a tear have I shed for her sake
when she little thought of me.


All the Maids of Islington
when forth to sport and play;
All but the Bailiffs Daughter dear,
she secretly stole away.
She put off her Gown of gray,
and put on her puggish Attire;
She Is up to fair London gone
her true Love to require.
As she went along the Road,
the weather being hot and dry,
There was she aware of her true Love,
at length came riding by.
She stepped to him as red as any Rose,
and took him by the Bridal Ring,
I pray you kind Sir give me one penny
to ease my weary Limb.
I prithee sweetheart can thou tell me
where that thou wast born?
At Islington kind Sir, said she,
where I have had many a scorn.
I prithee sweetheart can thou tell me
whether thou do know
The Bailiffs Daughter of Islington?
she is dead, Sir, long ago.
Then will I sell my goodly Steed,
my Saddle, and my Bow,
I will into some far Country,
where no man does me know.
O stay, O stay, thou goodly Youth
she is alive, she is not dead;
Here she stands by thy side,
and is ready to be thy Bride.
O farewell grief, and welcome joy,
ten thousand times and more;
For now I have seen my own true Love,
that I thought I should have seen no more.
