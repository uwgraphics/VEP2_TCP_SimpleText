A CARROUSE To The Emperor, the Royal Pole, And the much-wrong'd DUKE of
LORRAIN.
TO a new Tune, at the PLAYHOUSE.
HArk I hear the Cannons roar,
Ecchoing from the German Shore,
And the joyful news comes ore,
that the Turks are all confounded;
Lorrain comes they run they run,
Charge with your Horse through the grand Half Moon
And give Quarter unto none,
since Starenberg is Wounded.
Close your Ranks and each brave Soul
Fill a lusty flowing Bowl.
A grand Carrouse to the Royal Pole,
the Emperors brave defender:
Let no man leave his Post by stealth,
Plunder the Barbarous Visiers Wealth:
We Will drink a Helmet full, the Health.
of Second Alexander.
Fill the Helmet once again,
To the Emperors happy Reign,
And the much wronged Duke Lorrain.
but when the be beat ths Turks home,
Not a Soul the Field will leave,
Till they do again retrieve.
What the Moonster does detrieve,
and fix him in his Dukedom.
Then will be the Schen of war,
When such drinking Crowns prepare,
Those that love the Monsieurs fear,
their Courage will be shrinking;
Loyal hearts inspired with Hock,
Who can from a better Rock;
The French will never stand the Shock,
for all their Claret drinking,
Mahomet was a senseless Dog,
A Coffee-drinking drowsy Rogue,
The use of the Grape so much in vogue,
to deny to those adore him:
Had he allowed the fruits of the vine.
And gave them leave to carrouse in wine,
They had freely past the Rhine.
and conquered all before them,
Coffee Rallies no retreat,
Vind can only do the fear,
Had their force been twice as great,
and all of Ianazaries.
Tho he had drank the Danube dry,
And all their profit could supply,
By his interest from the Sky,
brisk Lang^on never miscarried.
Infidels are now ore come,
The most Christian Turk at home,
Watched the Fate of Christendom,
but all his hopes are shallow:
Since the Poles have led the Dance.
If Englands Monarch will advance.
And if he will send a Fleet to Fr^^^
he is a Whig that will not follow.
FINIS.
