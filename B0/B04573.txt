A New Satyricall BALLAD OF THE Licentiousness of the Times.
To the Tune of, The Blind Beggar of Bednall-Green.
I.
THe devil has left his puritanical dress,
And now like an Hawker attends on the Press,
That he might through the Town Sedition disperse,
In Pamphlets, and Ballads, in prose and in Verse.
II.
It Is surely so, for if the Devil wan't in it,
There would not be so many strange things in print:
Now each man writes what seems good in his Eyes,
And tells in bald Rimes his Inventions and Lies.
III.
Some relate to the World their own causeless fears,
Endeavoring to set us together by the ears,
They strive to make Factions for two great Commanders,
Tho one be in Holland, the other in Flanders.
IV.
They bawl and they yaul aloud through the whole Town,
The rights of Succession and Claims to the Crown,
And snarling and grumbling like Fools at each other,
Raise Contests and Factions betwixt Son and Brother.
V.
Here one does on this side his Verses oppose,
Up starts another and justs with him in prose,
On Rumor a Jade, they get up, and mount her,
And so like Don Quixot with Wind-mills Encounter.
VI.
Our Sun is not setting, it does not grow dark yet,
The King is in health still, and gone to New Market,
Let then idle Coxcomb's leave off their debating,
What either side says is unmannerly prating.
VII.
Another tho he be but a senseless Widgion
Will like an Archbishop determine Religion:
What ere his opinion is that must be best,
And strait he Confutes, and Confounds all the rest.
VIII.
In The Coffee house here one with a grave face,
When after salute, he has taken his place,
His Pipe being lighted begins for to prate,
And wisely discourses the affairs of the State.
IX.
Another in fury the board strait does thump,
And highly extolls the blessed Times of the Rump;
The Pope and all Monarchs he sends to the Devil,
And up in their places he sets Harry Nevill.
X.
Another who would be distinguished from Cit,
And swearing God dam me, to show him a wit,
(Who for all his huffing one grain has not got)
Scoffs at all Religion, and the Popish plot.
XI.
One with an uncivil satirical Jest,
To be thought a wit, has a fling at the Priest,
He jears at his Betters, and all men of note,
From the Alderman to the Canonical coat.
XII.
A politic Citizen in his blew gown,
As gravely in shop he walks up, and down,
Instead of attending the wares on his staul,
Is all day relating th'intreagues at White Hall.
XIII.
And though to speak Truth he be but a Noddy,
He Would have you to think that he is somebody,
With politic shrug, even as bad as a Curse,
He cries out, Oh! the Times, no Mortal saw worse.
XIV.
Then comes a wise Knight as the whole Citty's Factor,
Speaks Prologue in prose, too grave for an Actor,
And being sore frighted, in a learned speech,
To stand to their Arms all the Citts does beseech.
XV.
The Cobbler in stall, did you but hear him prate,
You Would think that he sat at the helm of the State,
His awl laid aside, and in right hand a pot.
He roundly rips up the Soul of the Plot.
XVI.
But it is not enough to see what is past,
For these very Men become Prophets at last,
And with the same eyes can see what is meant,
To be Acted and done in the next Parliament.
XVII.
His Worship so wise, who a Kingdom can Rule,
Is by none dear Wife at home made a Fool,
For though he does see through dark Mists of the State,
He cannot see the Horns that she plants on his pate.
XVIII.
The Women too prate of the Pope and the Turk,
Who should play with their Tails, or else be at work,
But two Noble Virtues they have attained to, I think,
To handle State matters, and take off their drink.
XIX.
Petition the Players to come on the Stage,
There to represent the vice of the Age,
That people may see in Stage looking-Glasses,
Fools of all sorts, and these pollitick Asses.
XX.
And thus I have shown you the vice of the Nation,
Which wants of these Things a through-Reformation,
But when that will be I cannot determine,
For plenty breeds Vice, as soul Bodies breed Vermin.
XXI.
Men may prate and may write, but it is not their Rimes,
That can any ways change or alter the Times,
It is now grown an Epidemical Disease,
For people to talk and to write what they please.
XXII.
God bless our Good King who our little World Rules,
And is not disturbed rt the Actions of Fools,
It very much helps a Wise Man's Melancholy,
To see and observe and to Laugh at their Folly.
London, Printed in the Year, 1679.
