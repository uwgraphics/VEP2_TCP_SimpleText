The New Courtier:
The Tune is, Cloris, since thou art fled away, etc.




UPon the Change where Merchants meet
'Twixt Cornhill and Thredneedle-street;
Where Wits of every size is hurled,
To treat of all things in the World:
I saw a folded Paper fall,
And upon it, these words were writ,
Have at all.
Thought I, if Have at all. it be,
For ought I know, it is have at Me:
And (if consequence be true)
It may as well be Have at You:
Then listen pray to what I shall,
In brief declare, what is written there:
Have at all.
SONG.

I Am a Courtier, who in sport,
Do come from the Utopian Court,
To whisper softly in your Ear,
How high we are, and what we were:
To tell you all would be too much,
But here and there a little touch,
Have at all.
I was not many years ago,
In tater'd trim from top to toe:
But now niy ruined Robes are burned,
My Rags are all to Ribbons turned:
My Patches into Pieces fall,
I cogg a Dye, Swagger and Lie,
Have at all.
Upon my Pantelonian Pate
I wear a Milleners Estate:
But when he Duns me at the Court,
I show him a Protection for it:
Whilst he both to Protesting fall,
I cry, Dam me, Sir, you lie,
Have at all.
Since Venus shaved off my Hair,
A powdered Perewig I wear,
Which brings me in the Golden Girls,
Game-Royal for Dukes, Lords and Earls:
When Love does for a cooler call,
My fancy drives, at maids and wives,
Have at all.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.


MY Lodgings never are at quiet,
Another Duns me for my Diet,
I had of him in Fifty three,
Which I forgot, so did not he:
I call him saucy Fellow, sirrah,
And draw my Sword to run him thorough
Have at all.
Yet once a Friend that saved my Life,
Who had a witty wanton wife,
I did in (courtesy) requite,
Made him a Cuckold, and a Knight:
Which makes him mount like Tennis ball,
Whilst she and I, together cry:
Have at all.
But yet these Citts are subtle Slaves,
Most of them Wits, and knowing Knaves;
We get their Children, and they do,
From us get Lands, and Lordships too:
And it is most fit in those affairs
The Lands should go to the right hairs
Have at all.
A Soldier I directly hate:
A Cavelier once broke my Pate
With Cane in hand he overcome me
And took away my Mistress from me:
for I confess I love a VVench
Be she English, Irish, Dutch, or French
Have at all.
A Soldiers life is not like mine
I will be Plump when he shall Pine?
My Projects carry stronger force
Then all their Armed Foot and Horse:
What though his morter-peeces roar
My Chimney-peeces shall do more:
Have at all.
Thus I have given you in short
A Courtier of Utopian Court.
I Write not of Religion,
For (to tell truly) we have none.
If any me to Question call,
With pen or Sword, Hab Nab's the Word
Have at all.
