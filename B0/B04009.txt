The Lady of Pleasure, OR, THE LONDON Misses Frolic,
Whereby she got Money by her subtle Devices and Witty Intreagues, as she led
in the loose course of her life, which you will find by the subsequent matter

To a Pleasant New Playhouse Tune.
This may be Printed, R. L. S.





THere was a Lass in London Town;
both beauteous, fair and witty,
She traveled England up and down,
through every Town and City:
She got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
she got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny Farthing.
At last she came to Sturbridge-Fair,
and there she met a Farmer,
Who did desire to know her name,
and swore he would not harm her:
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain,
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny farthing.






SHe told him she was kind and just,
and never would do no Evil,
Her hand she in his Pocket thrust,
which was indeed uncivil;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny Farthing.
She told him then she was in haste,
and so from him she parted,
Who little thought to be disgraced,
when she had him deserted;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny Farthing.
But when the Reckoning came to pay,
the Farmer mist his Money,
Oh, then, quoth he, she is gone away,
whom I called dear and Honey;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it,-she got money by it,
four-pence-half penny farthing.
The Farmer he a Stranger was,
and so at last they Stocks'd him,
But this was not the worst, alas!
the wicked Jade had Pox'd him;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny farthing.
She traveled then to Bristol-Fair,
and there she met a Barber,
Tho gazed upon her Beauty fair,
love in his Breast did harbor;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny farthing.
The Barber was exceeding kind,
and monstrously did praise her,
But he did in conclusion find
that she had spoiled his Razor;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny farthing.
She saw a Cobbler brisk and free,
a sitting in his Stall too,
With him she would Familiar b^,
while he was at his Awl too;
But she got money by it, she got money by it,
she got money by the bargain;
She got money by it, she got money by it,
four-pence-half-penny farthing.
Thus you may see some London Dames,
that live about the City,
By such like Tricks procure their shames,
but it is the more the pity;
Yet they get money by it, they get money by it,
they get money by the bargain;
They get money by it, they get money by it,
four-pence-half-penny farthing.
Printed for J. Back, at the Black-Boy on London Bridge.
