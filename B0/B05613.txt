We Considering the great Blessings of Almighty GOD, on Our Sacred Persons,
Government and People, in showing Himself so Signally, by Delivering us from
many great and eminent Dangers in our Religion, Liberties, Properties, and all
that can be dear to Us, as especially at this time by the late Success, given
to Our Arms, against the Powerful and Bloody Designs of France, and of many of
Our unnatural and rebellious Subjects; especially the barbarous Irish, who had
Combined to Invade Our Kingdoms, with all the Fierceness and Inhumanity which
Fury could suggest, and at a time when We were obliged to be absent, for the
necessary Defense of Christendom, from the Tyrrannous Attempts of the French
King; and Our Armies put at a distance upon so good and important Grounds: Yet
it has pleased Our Gracious and Almighty GOD, to Defeat their chief Attempt
and to overthrow the best of the Strength of Our Adversaries, by the late great
and happy Victory gained by Our Fleet on that of France, to the Confusion of
Our Enemies, and well grounded Encouragement of Our Friends; And as this signal
Blessing is conferred on Us by the GOD of Hosts, whose Cause We own, and on
whose Assistance, We wholly rely; So it is Our Duty, and the Duty of all Our
good Subjects, to return Praise and Glory to His Blessed Name: Therefore We,
