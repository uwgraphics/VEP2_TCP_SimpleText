The good Fellows best Beloved:
Now if you will know what that should be,
I Will tell you it is called good Ipse he:
It Is that which some people do love in some measure,
some for their profit and some for their pleasure.
To the tune of Blew Capp.




AMong the nine Muses if any there be
that unto good fellowship friendly adhere,
Let them give asistance this time unto me,
for I in this ditty intend to prefer
A thing that is beloved
of rich and of poor,
It is well approoved,
there is reason therefore,
My due approbation
shall evermore be
In the commendation
of good ipse he.
All sorts and conditions the high and the low,
although not alike yet all in some measure,
Unto this my theme their affection will show,
according as they have time, stomach, or treasure:
There Is few live so purely,
but they now and then
Will sip it demurely
both women and men,
Both marryd and simple
do jointly agree,
To fuddle their noses
with good ipse he.
Both Lawyers and clients that come to the term,
how e're the case goes of one thing I am sure,
Before any business can be settled firm,
good liquor and money the means must procure,
A Tavern bar often,
makes peace ere they part,
Canary can soften
a plaintiffes hard heart,
Their glasses they sup off,
and make merry glee,
Such power has a cup of
good good ipse he.
The Tailor coms rubbing his hands in the morn,
and calls for a cup of the But next the wall,
Be it of the Grape or the Barley Corn,
he will drink out his breakfast his dinner and all,
He says call and spare not,
I Will go thorough stitch,
Hang pinshing I care not
for being too rich:
John Black's a good fellow,
and he alowes me
To make my self mellow
with good ipse he.
The merry Shoo-maker when it is a hard frost,
says he cannot work for his wax it is frozen,
Faith what shall we do, let us go to our Host
and make our selves merry with each a half dozen,
With this resolution,
they purpose to thrive,
But ere the conclusion,
that number proves five,
They sing merry catches,
few trades men that be,
Are Shoo-makers matches
at good ipse he.
The second part,
To the same tune.


THe Mason and bricklayers are somer birds,
the Winter to them is a time of vacation:
Then they and their laborours live on their words,
unless (like the Ant) they have made preparation,
And yet though they have not,
they ne'rethelesse think,
Tush what if we save not,
must we have no drink,
We Will pawn tray and shovle,
and more if need be,
Our noses to fuddle
with good ipse he.
Grim Vulca^ the blacksmith is chief of al trades
then think you that he will be in drinking inferior
No truly when he is with his merry comrades,
heel laugh and sing ditties you never heard merrier,
He cries out he is hot,
and still this is his note
Come gi's the other pot:
here is a spark in my throat,
He calls and he pays,
there is no man more free,
He seldom long stays
from good ipse he.
The Tanner when he comes to Leaden Hall,
after a hard journey will make himself merry,
He will have good liquor and welcome with all,
the Bull for good beer and the naggs-head for shery,
No bargain shall stand,
but what liquor does seal,
Quite throughout the Land,
thus most tradesmen do deal,
In Tavern or Alehouse
most matches made be,
The first word's where shall us
find good ipse he.
The London shopkeepers that cry what do lack
when they have sold wares and money have taken,
They Will give their chapman a pint o'th best sack,
the price of it out of their money abating,
The proverb observing
they that money take
Must pay all the charges,
this bargain they make,
Thus Liquor makes all men,
most friendly agree,
Both low men and tall men,
love good ipse he.
The honest plain Husba^dman when that he goes
to fair or to market with corn or with cattle:
When he has dispatched he remembers his nose,
how that must be armed as it were to a battle,
Then like to a gallant
to drinking he falls,
Yet though he is pot valiant,
he pays what he calls:
He scorns reputation
in that base degree,
His chief recreation
is good ipse he.
The generous Servingmen meeting each other
as well as their masters sometimes will be merry,
He that is a good fellow is loved like a brother,
with making him welcome they nere are weary
He that is a clown,
as a clown he may go
Quite thoroughout the town,
such a fellow they will know:
But those that are right
will in union agree,
By morn or by night
at good ipse he.
In brief thus it is which both women and men,
so dearly affect that before they will lack it:
They Will pawn all they have nay and so now and then,
gown, kirtle, or wastcoate, cloak breeches and jacket,
Although they want victual
if they can get chinke,
Be It never so little,
it is most on it for drink:
The rich and the beggar,
the bond and the free
Will oftentimes swagger
at good ipse he.
