EPITHALAMIUM On the Auspicious Match, betwixt the Right Honorable. The Earl
of WIGTOUN And the truly Virtuous Lady MARGARET LINDSAY Daughter to the Right
Honorable, The Earl of BALCARROS.
NOW is the Time the Origin of Light,
Does equally divide our Day from Night.
When the Musicians of the Air do sing
Melodious Notes to welcome in the Spring
When each of them do choose their proper Mate,
And Bill, and Hugg, and closly Copulate,
More through the Force of Love than Phoebus Heat,
This is the time when Hymen choos'd to join
This Worthy pair, and to make one of twain;
They Are both descended of an Ancient Race
Which a long train of Noble Worthies Grace,
Both in the Flower of Age, and Venus Spring,
Are equally adorned in every thing;
He is a stately Personage and fair,
Endeu'd with each Accomplishment that is Rare,
Of nature, or Refined Literature,
Her very name insinuats her praise,
She is a Pearl indeed, and of great Price
She Is Frugal, Chaste, and Beauteous and Wise,
Like the Wise Merchant in the Gospel He
Has found the Pearl and hid Treasury,
Which in true Computation is far more
Then all the Riches on the Eastern shoor,
And in Requital does himself Bequeath,
A greater prise then either India has;
The Conquest's Equal, Equal is the prise,
The acquisition's a sweet Paradise
On either side, it does surpass my Skill
T'express the pleasure that they both shall feel,
When he and she in Hymen's name shall bow,
And pay to each the duty that they owe.
A. B.
