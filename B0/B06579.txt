The Widows Rant, Or a Wedding-Song, upon Widow Jackson in Borthuicks-Closs.
Composed by one of her own SEXES.
1.
ALL ye Wifes in this Town
That's moved for your Men,
And ye that puts on Mourning deep
When they are dead for them;
2.
And cries O my dear
Since thou art from me gone,
To no Man else I Will Wedded be
But live single alone.
3.
Detain your selves from sobs,
And barken to my call,
I Will tell you of a Chaste Widow
The Honor of you all;
4.
It does not much exceed
A Month or five weeks space,
Since she put on her mourning Weed
And fiegned her face;
5.
And so her Neighbor said,
When she was Mourning sore,
Ye are a Widow now indeed
And woe is us therefore.
6.
Said she hold ye your peace
And be not troubled sore,
For though my man be freely dead;
I am even as before;
7.
For when he was alive
Although he lay me near,
Nevertheless a Widow I
Have been more then ten year.
8.
But Notwith standing she
For him has taken such care,
That sleep and rest is freely gone
From her both late and air.
9.
For which she did complain
Unro the Pastor then,
Because that for her Husbands death
She was grieved with pain.
10.
But yet her Neighbors dreads
That she her self did fain,
And says it was but Tam auld's Fleas
That made her seek the Men.
11.
It Is likewise said by some,
That her Man's began again,
And others say that by his Grips
They are sting to the Bayne.
12.
But whither its because
That she has him forgot.
That he is going through the Closs,
This truly I know not.
13.
Or if it be because,
That she has her Bed Clothed,
With covrings, and with other things,
Which he has wholly loathed.
14.
Or if it be indeed,
Because that she does spend,
The Money on Beads, Kalls, and Rings,
By which his Son should send.
15.
Or if in fine it be,
That Ale raising their Brain,
Makes them see three, where there is but two
Determine if ye can.
16.
Nevertheless she has
A remedy procured,
By which she may be freed from Fleas,
And of their sting procured.
17.
By finding out a Man,
That of such things had Skill,
As killing Fleas, and healing stings,
Which tempted her most ill.
18.
But as some ones does Judge
He plasters did apply,
Before that he was Graduat,
Fearing that she should dye.
19.
But least that ye should doubt
Of whom I have thus Rim'd
I Will tell you Name, and Surname both,
That I may ease your mind.
20.
She is a Lusty Wife,
and thinks her self no dross,
Her Name's called Nansie Cruck shanks,
She lives in Borthuicks-Closs.
FINIS.
