True Lovers Victory Or the Northen Couple agreed.
With Sugared words and smiling looks
He did charm her senses,
That she did yield unto his Love
For all her late pretenses.
To a rare Northern Tune, Or, Jennies Cog-wheel.


A Bonny blithe Lad
in the North Country,
Whom Cupid had Wounded
most craftily
He met with his Love
and he told her his mind,
And thus he did greet her
with words so kind.
Come sit the down by me
mine own sweet joy,
Thou will quite kill me
if thou prove coy.
Should thou prove coy
and not love me,
Where shall I find
such a one as thee.
I have been at Wakes
and I have been at Fares
Yet never could I meet one
that with thee compares:
Far have I traveled
yet never could find,
One I loved like thee
if thou prove so kind.
Thou shall have a
gay Gown of the best,
With gay fine Buskins
thy feet shall be dressed:
With Caplet^s of Roses
thy head shall be crowned
And thy pink Petticoat
shall be laced round.
When thou art dressed in
thy Robes so gay,
Thou shall be seen like
the Queen of May:
The bonny young Lasses
that lives by thee,
Shall all take delight
in thy company.
We will go early
to the brook side,
And catch Fishes
as they do glide
Every little Fish
thy Prisoner shall be
Thou shall catch them
and i^le catch thee.
The Birds in the Grove
shall come at thy beck,
And from thy Lilly white
hands they shall peck
And whilst with their Notes
about thee they play,
I will sing thee
a roundelay.
Now let me kiss
thy cherry lips fair,
And praise all thy Features
that are so rare:
Thy forehead is high
and lofty does rise,
Thy sweet ruby lips
and thy pretty black Eyes,
I Will lie by thee
all the cold night,
Thou'st want nothing
for thy delight.
Thou shall hapt any thing
thou shall have me
Surely I have something
that will please thee.
She hearing her Lover
Thus kindly complain
From making him answer
she could not refrain,
She gave him her hand
with a low courtesy,
And thus she replied
I Will have none but the^.
Thy bonny fair face
And thy words so sweet,
Did conquer my heart
When we first did meet,
The^'s never a Lad
In the North Country
Shall lever have my favor
but only thee,
Then let us gang to the Kirk
now with speed,
For why I think long
till we do the deed,
Since I may have any thing
I will have thee,
Because thou have something
that will please me.
