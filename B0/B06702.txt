A REPRESENTATION Of the great EVILS arising by the EXPORTATION of WOOL

A REPRESENTATION of Great EVILS arising by the EXPORTATION of WOOL, Humbly
Offered to the Honorable HOUSE of COMMONS.
By WILLIAM WOODFORD.
I. Exportation of Wool will certainly Impoverish our own Nation, and Enrich
others, By taking away the Employment of the Poor. By Ruining Our Trade of the
Woollen Manufactures, and Dependers thereupon; and By enabling France, Holland
and Flanders, etc. (now greatly striving for that End) to deprive us of it.

II. The want of Employment of the Poor will be a Cause of great Charges upon
Land and Estates, to maintain them.

Or of their Starving.

Or of Exporting themselves whether Wool is Exported, etc.

And Exporting themselves will be a Cause of the falling of the Value of Lands,
by Lessening the number of the Consumers of the Product thereof.

For the Fewer the People shall be, the Lesser the Value of Lands must needs be.

III. The Less Occasion there shall be of our Manufactures abroad (by means of
the Exportation of Wool) the poorer the Nation in General must needs be.

Our Manufactures (and not the single Products of our Lands) being the chief
Cause of our Riches, which are brought from other Nations in Return for the
same.

IV. The Exportation of Wool has been modestly reckoned to be 60000 l. per
annum Loss to the King in his Customs outward, besides the consequential Loss
inwards.

V. There are several good intended Laws already made for remedy thereof; But
the same could not be effectually put in Execution for want of a Fund to defray
the Charge of the Management of so good a Work.

All which is Humbly offered to the Great Wisdom of the Honorable House with
all Submission, etc.
