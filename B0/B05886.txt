The Slighted Maid. OR, The Pining Lover.
With sighs and moans she does entreat her Dear,
whilst he seems to be deaf and will not hear;
At length his frozen heart begins to melt,
being moved with the passion she had felt.
To the Tune of, I prithee Love turn to me.




WAs ever Maiden so scorned,
by one that she loved so dear:
Long time I have sighed and mourned,
and still my love will not hear.
O turn to me my own dear heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me;
For thou art the Lad I long for
and alas what remedy.
My Lodging it is on the could ground,
and very hard is my fare:
But that Which troubles me most, is
the unkindness of my Dear.
O turn to me my own Sweetheart,
and I prithee Love-turn to me;
For thou art the man I long for,
and alas what remedy.
O stop not thy ears to the wailings,
of me a poor harmless Maid.
You know we are subject to failings,
blind Cupid has me betrayed.
And now I must cry O turn Love.
and I prithee Love turn to me.
For thou art the man that alone can
procure my liberty.
Now can thou be so hard hearted,
and cruel to me alone.
If ever we should be parted,
then all my delight is gone.
But ever I cry O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me
For thou art the man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
The second part,
to the same tune.




I Will make thee pretty sweet posies,
and constant I ever will prove,
I Will strew thy chamber with roses,
and all to delight my Love.
Then turn to me my own dear heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the man that alone can
procure my liberty.
I Will do my endeavor to please thee,
by making thy bed full soft.
Of all thy sorrows I Will ease thee,
by kissing thy lips full often.
Then turn to me my own dear heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the man that alone can
procure my liberry.
But thou will harden thy heart still,
and be deaf to my pitiful moan:
So I must endure the smart still,
and tumble in straw all alone.
Whilst still I cry O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
If that thou still do disdain me,
I never will love the more.
Thy cruelty shall never pain me,
for I Will have another in store.
But still I cry O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
By hearing her pitiful clamor,
the passion of Love he felt,
He could no longer disdain her,
his frozen heart it did melt;
For ever she cried O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the man, that alone can
procure my liberty.
He said my Love I will please thee
thy heaviness grieves me sore,
But let not sorrow once seize thee,
I never will grieve thee more.
I Will turn to thee my own kind heart,
dear Love I Will turn to thee.
For I am the man that now art come
to procure thy liberty.
I Will crown thee with garlands of straw then
and marry thee with a rush ring,
My frozen heart it will thaw then,
and merrily we will sing,
But ever she cried O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the man, that alone can
release my misery.
Most lovingly he embraced her
and called her his hearts delight,
And close by his side he plac;t her,
all sorrow was vanished quite,
And now she for joy cried, turn Love
and I prithee Love turn to me
For thou art the man, that alone have
releast me of misery.
FINIS.
