down Of (...) GENERAL ASSEMBLY, Begun the 12. of August 1639.

Printed in the Year 16^^

PREFACE.
WE have now found an access to the Throne of Grace, and I pray God that these
that are assembled here together to get this work crowned, may first labor t^
get these two things removed; First, the conscience of our guiltiness, alas!
there are non^ that discerns or considers their sins, one thin^ should move our
hearts that the Commons (...) the Land are so ignorant that they know n^^ God;
and from that proceeds such wickedness If that Pastors had been more diligent
in instructing, this Church had had a better fa^^ ere now. Secondly, Our
weakness stays as mountain, and we cannot climb unless^ we be helped, there is
no remedy but the brightness of his mercy that he would dissip^^^ these
clouds, and no remedy for our vvea^^ness but the Power of his might let us
therefore beg the same in the Name of JESUS.

TEXT. ACTS Chap. V. 32. to the end.
When they heard that they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay
them.

Then stood there up one in the Counsel, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a Doctor
of Law, had in reputation among all the People, and commanded to put the
Apostles forth a little space.

And said unto them, ye men of Israel, take heed to your selves, what ye
intend to do as touching these men, etc.


THE Words that were spoken by Peter and the other Apostles could give no just
Cause of Provocation to the Adversaries, for in their Doctrine they insisted
upon two innocent Points; One was faith in Christ, that since the Lord whom
they crucified was now exalted to be a Prince that therefore they might believe
in him, and get Remission of Sins, and the other was Obedience, they ought to
obey God rather then men; yet they resolved to kill them, and had done so, if
the Lord had not raised up a man to save them, and he prevailed that their fury
was laid, wherein the Apostles rejoiced and doubled their Zeal.

There are 4. particulars in the Text very considerable.

1. The bad affects the Apostles preaching had upon the peoples hearts. 2. The
mean that God did use in Saveing of his Servants. 3. The unjust proceedings of
the Adversaries. 4. The Disposition and Diligences of the Apostles that ceased
not; whereby you may learn that often times it comes to pass that men in
Authority are provoked against Religion, whither in Obedience to God, or in
the trial of their faith yet the Lord hes many ways to save his own
Children, and the end shall be joy to the Saints and Advancement to the
Gospel.
Let us return to the first, which was the bad effects of the preaching, and
that was two fold, one in their hearts, another in their heads, they were cut
to the heart, the Word is borrowed from the cutting of a Sword o^ Sau, in the
7. Acts, it is said they guashed with their teeth, and Acts 2.37. it is said
they were pricked in their hearts, we find another effect, but it is
different, the one and the other are very like; Romans 11. v. 8. he calls the
Spirit of Slumber the Spirit of compunction, the Godly have a pricking and your
wicked have a pricking, as in that place, Acts 2, 37. they were pricked and
took Counsel, but they go to them that wounded them, but they do not so here,
but would slay them.

The Word of God his very different effects in the Godly, and the wicked, Rev.
1:16. it is like a two edged Sword, and Heb. 4. lively and weighty in Operation
it either pricks or cutts, it is either a Word to cure thee or to kill thee.
The Ministers of Christ although they be otherwise of no Reputation, yet if
they could handle this Sword a right it should wound; the children of God when
they are wounded shoud bear it patiently, they are wounded because of their
Sins, the other because they cannot commit Sin. So the one prepares for Christ,
the other for Destruction, ^he one shall end in health the other in woe, and
(...) may seem very Strange that all this time we should never have heard a
Word or Letter from ^ur Prelates, that have been wounded with the ^word; Men and
Brethren I will not insist upon their guiltiness, for we can say no more of
them then the Text says. And they took counsel to slay them, and now we come
to the Counsel, they resolved to slay them, Counsel is good and excellent
neither has it been derogatory to Authority for as Solomon says in Counsel
there is stability, these matters that are not agitat by Counsel are tossed
upon fancy, as Solomon felt the benefit of using it; 1. because it was young.
2. Because it was violen^ consider the Counsel of our Adversaries, i^ was very
violent but it had not the other for the men wanted not their years, yet they
ha^ this violence, and they had another bad quality to Supply that, and this ye
may Learn^ from the 17. Verse, many of them were Sadduces and so unmeet to be
Counselors, for in Ac^. 23. you see they believe not a Resurrection and when
such unbeleevers are Councellers their Sentence will be to cut the throat (...)
Church an Common Wealth, they care no^ what violence they use to get preferment
bu^ especially Kirkmen that are Sadduces wh^^ cruelty shall be exercised by
them, but esp^cially when they are given over to the Devil^^ Ministers when
they fall are like Angels that a^^ Devils, no men in the Scripture are call^^
Devils but Ministers so they become incarna^^ Devils, give God thanks (and
his Majest^^ that his given us this day to meet together a^^ no thanks to them
that either you are hearing, or that and I am preaching to you.

Follows the mean the second thing, which was the man that spoke and his
Speech, the man was a Pharisee, he was Learned and a Doctor of Divinity, for
his good parts of reputation naturally and Politickly wise, and upon such
grounds he convinces them all, and further he seems to be a Peaceable man and
does what he can to save innocent blood but there was one thing wanting, Faith
in Christ, and love to his word. Act. 22. It is said, Paul was brought up at
the feet of Gamaliel, as was his Scholar so was his Master, he was ignorant
and so a persecuter, there is more required for accomplishment of a man then
the gifts of the mind, which this man seems to have a man's natural parts are
like a vesture of gold, and the gifts of grace like precious stones, but this
faith is like a precious Diamond in the middle, incomparably greater in worth
judge of things according to their quality the best of these beside the great
jewel are given to the wicked and the godly and are bestowed on them for other
men's good and not their own but this is proper to thy self and for thy self
and this jewel shall make the rich and it concerns non more then Ministers it
is required of Ministers that they should be Learned and in reputation with the
people, wise, peaceably disposed and Learned (...) although they cannot come to
Eminent yet competent knowledge. 1 Tit. ^ to exhort and comfort and convince
the en^my not like these men that have sheares an^ tubs to cut of the woul and
carry, their mi^ away but no care to feed them, I say the^ should be furnished
with all things both i^wardly and outwardly, and it is a pity that w^ have not
a Lebanon for trees to grow in, Professor here and a Professor there all the
plan^ing will Soon be destroyed if there be not place for them, we are all
crying for good M^nisters, have a care of the good plants that not Learning to
read a Sermon and to Spill it i^ the telling it is a pity that these that boast
s^ should be so vain, ard als great a pity that w^ have not sound Divinity,
many get other men^ preachings and these that are Learned should be given to
such alterations, yet although tho^ were als Learned als Gamaliel if thou have n^
more, thou art not meet to be a Minister o^ Christ, you know what intertainment
the Apostles got at Athens, they mocked them, (...) man that his a Learned head
and a gracele^ heart is not fit for Christ's work let us join both together of
all men that ever I was acquainted with, I sau none so profane as Ministers,
what was good in this man, let us strive to imitate and what he wants let us
Labor ^o have our Souls filled with the love of Christ and think more of grace
than of Learning. Before I come to his Speech, see not only Gods mercies but
also Gods Providence which his wisdom had designed and there or two pieces of
his Providence here seen one was the Lord brought them back from the gates of
death when their soul as it were was in their hand; the other by such a mean as
they could not dream of, and these two are very ordinare with the Lord when yuu
are in extremity he shows himself and in such ways, and we may truly say that
he has done so with us, that when Episcopacy was deeply rooted even then God
would cut them down. Quest: Wherefor does the Lord so. 1. Answer for 3
reasons, 1 that when the Lord comes in Exstremity that his hand may be
discerned and he get the greater glory, Isaiah, 33, 7.9. Lebanon is ashamed and
cut down. 2. For the further confusion of the enemies. Obad. 3. Whose
habitation is in the high rocks who says in their hearts who shall bring me
down to the ground. 3 For our encouragement and our Posterity after us, that
we should only put our confidence in him who is only able to help us.

Now we come to the speech it self, wherein take notice of his intention, to
Restrain he was a wise man and kneu no good would follow, if they were harmed
he knew the Roma^^ would be angry, and that the people had good likeing to
them, this was a good and peaceable intention, tho not a pure and pious if he
had had any aim to Gods glory and the Gospel of Christ it had been good; I man
no question, there are many among us, th^^^ have peaceable desires and Laudible
intente^tions, but more is required, let us labor ^^^ have pious intentions,
not only to have t^^ present troubles settled, it shall soon break forth again,
see what is aggreeable to his will Iste est malus, qui suae causae bonus, he is
b^^ that is good only for himself, let us beseech the Lord that we may have
hearts to seek his ho^our and the enlargement of Christ's Kingdom.

Now for his argument, I would have y^ refrain from these men, if it be of
God, will come to pass; this Argument had its own weakeness; if it be of men it
should be hindere^ if of God it should have be enfurthered the th^^^ should put
them to trial; we will not pass wh^^ is commendable in him, he proceeds on a
goo^ ground, if of men, to be rejected; if of God; ^^ be received Mat: 21.25.
The Baptism of Joh^ was it from heaven or of men. Ephesians: 4. T^^^ the Spirits
whether they be of men or God it was the perpetual doctrine of the Prophets
Thus says the Lord, and Paul says, th^^ which I received do I deliver; they
that are ^sciples, must be Believers, not what man ^ith: First that it is true
in matters internal ^t not in matters external. Moses when he appointed to
build the Tabernacle, he gets ^s directions: Solomon when he built the ^emple
had his warrant from David; and lest ^hey think Solomon's warrant not to be
sufficient, Ezekiah had his warrant according to ^he commandment of David. O
but you will ^ay, it is not so in the New Testament, there ^re not so many
ceremonies, it is a pitiful ^ing, we will not acknowledge that which we are
ignorant of; distinguish betwixt multi^ude and number of ceremonies, they had
ma^y we have fever, shall we think, we have ^ot so great light, as these who
were to put an ^spersion on Christ, let us strive to learn what Gods will is,
when it is of God receive ^t, but when of men reject it. Many ceremo^ies have
exercised the Church of God many ^imes and especially that of the Government of
the Church, and there are two causes that hinder the decideing of it. 1. The
hudge judgment of God upon the congregations, and so puts Gods Servants to
trial. 2. Cause is the avarice of Churchmen, so long as their avarice lasts
there is no end of Episcopacy. 3. Because we do not examine, what kind of
Government Christ gave, the Question Government is not Juris but facti. VV^ is
that agreeable with reason and civil Government, No, but de ^^cto, what
Governm^^^ Christ has established, an office that is J^^^^ Divino should be
established, but if it be office of man it ought to be rejected. T^^^ great
Doctor teaches us that when God fig^^ against man he shall prevail, but when
M^^ fights against God, they shall be found fight^^^ against him, Genesis 11. The
builders of Bab^^ the Lord made every one of them that th^^ knew not what
another said, this was an ea^^ thing to the Lord, and so the work was
inte^rupted in building: The Lord is wonderful building, and can bring down
Babel, gre^^^ opposition was, made against Joseph by h^^ Brethren, and great
opposition against David yet Gods counsel behoved to stand, what o^position
was made against Gods people in Egypt in bringing them out of Egypt yet the
behoved to come forth: and you know in you^ propagation of the Gospel and the
work of reformation, and because many his opposed yet it has gone through. And
you kno^ great opposition is been used against this wor^^ by the wicked, but
yet blessed be God it ha^^ proclaimed it self through the Land.

He brought in two instances to prove that the ^rk of man will come to naught,
one of Theu^ he was one that conceived himself to be a ^phet but a false one:
and Judas he would have ^waded the people from giveing that duty to (...)
civil Magistrate that they ought to have ^ne, and there were Sects that
followed them; ^e errors of Religion commonly springs ey^ from the Spirit of
Theudas, which is a Spi^ of fantasy, or from the other and that is a ^rit of
rebellion and that is not of God.

Consider all tho they be the many yet there (...) more like ways as there are
Spirits contraire (...) the Spirit of Theudas, and this is your Spi^ of
Pharaoh, who said who is the Lord that ^t I should serve him, and that is
Atheism, (...) other is contrary to Judas and that is Herod's, ^t runs to
flattery, an gives man that, that ^tains to God.

As Atheism is an abomination before God, (...) is Rebellion and flatiery the
true reformed ^ligion abhorres disobedience, and gives to ^sar that which is
Caesar's, and sure we pro^e a harmeles Religion. I would exhort you (...) two
things, first to the course of faith which ^ores godlesness and vain conceits
of men (...) am now pleading for the innocence of ^ligion) ye know what our
adversaries have ^nted against us, that we are guilty of many crimes and
tricks, and that we have made ople to feign themselves inpired with Spirit of
divination, which is against (...) Truth. The second thing is the course
obedience there was never a greater friend Kings then Christ, there is no
question about Judas os Galilee his part, whether should pay tax or not nether
of that in war ^^verence to Princes or that respect we carr^ him, I wish his
own prayers were never (...) that does not heartily pray for his Maje^^^ but
the Question is what is his part in Relig^^^ and matters Ecclesiastic, it is
both said printed that I should have spoken much, my fellow Brethren (the rest
of the Coveters) would not allow of that I said and say regal inspection
belongs to Kings over Ch^^^^ matters, and that the King was Supreme op over all
this Kingdom, now my adv^^^^ries think I have made him a Churchman, ignorant
but not So, as for the head o^ Church we acknowledge none but Christ for the
other Episcopus is a name that (...) well proper to a civil Magistrate as to a
S^^^^tual, therefore Constantine says, Vos Episcopi intra, ego extra. Next
that Gustos utriusque Tabulae, Vindication be unto him, who carries the Sword
of San^ and coerction, and Convocation of Syn ^ow this present General
Assembly is con^^ened and as he conveens so he should examine ^^em, if he find
any thing against the Word (...) God he should reject it, thus I speak not of
negative voice his Majesty has.

And now I have shown the particulars I ^^ve been taxed upon, hopeing this
honou^^ble Assembly, will further consider of it and ^ow I come to speak one
word to your Commissioners Grace who represents his Majesty. As for your Grace
his Majesty's Commissioner we beseech you to see that Caesar have his ^wne, but
let not Caeser have what is due to ^od, and belongs to him, God has exalted
^our Grace to many high places within these ^^w years, and more especially now,
be thank^^l and labor to exalt Christ's Throne, some ^e exalted like Haman and
some like Mor^ecai.

I pray God these good parts the Lord has ^ndowed you with you may use them a
right, (...) the Israelites when they came out of Egypt (...) give all their
Silver and Gold for building ^f the Tabernacle, I tell your Gr: ye must be
^omptable for all your actions especially in these public busineses.

And to you right honorable and right Wor^^ipfull Members of this Assembly, go
on in ^our Zeal constantly, it is not true zeal that grows cold, but the
nearer it is the end it be the hoter if it shall please God that by hands the
light of the Gospel shall be contin^^ Surely it shall be a refreshment to you
and (...) children that you should have lived when light of the Gospel was
almost extinguished now to see it quickened again after all the Troubles. With a
holy Moderation go on Zeal is a good Servant but an ill Master, a ship that his
a full sail and wants a rudder.

We have need of Christian prudence ye know what ill speeches our adversaries
h^ made upon us let it be seen to his Majesty (...) this Government can very
well stand wit^ Monarchiall Government, hereby we s^^^ gain his Majesty's
favor and God shall get Glory to whom be praise for ever and ever Amen.

FINIS.
