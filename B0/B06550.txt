(...)
The Young Man he with carriage bold,
did often salute the Maiden,
And unto her these words he told,
his heart with love was laden;
And if to him her love she would grant
he would do his best endeavor.
To maintain her she should not want,
and he would forsake her never.
Because he was poor the maid was coy,
and would not have him entertained
But at last he became her love and joy,
and much wealth with her he gained.

AS I was walking forth of late
in the prime of the weather,
I spide a young man and a maid
both walking close together.
The man begun, and thus he sung,
sweet heart do not forgo me,
Love me little and love me long,
for I do come to woo thee.

Maid. Woo me good sir for what intent:
you surely do but jear me;
I never knew yet what Love meant,
how then should I love you dearly?
I am too young to be a wife
and no love I can afford ye,
I hold still best a single life
my Maiden head will not load me.

Man. Ye do but jest sweet heart, quoth he,
my honor so to stain love.
My heart is Royal unto thee
and so it shall remain love.
My love is set on none but thee sweacute;et heart
meaning no harm to do thee
Then let all sorrows from thee part,
for I do come to woo thee.

Maid. It is but in vain young man, quoth she
to talk of such a matter,
Then speak no more of Love to me,
I know you do but flatter;
For young men they will cog and lie
and make much to abode ye,
But I am resolved a maid to die,
my Maiden head will not load me.

Man. It Is true my dear, I must confess,
that is but a light carriage,
Yet I wish I had the happiness
to join with you in marriage
Though I cant court and complement
with fine speeches to thee,
My heart is good and fully bent
at this time for to woo thee.

Maid. ALas! good sir your time you waste
it so seems by your talking
If that you be in such haste,
I pray you now be walking;
The door is wide you may be gone
no love I can afford ye:
I had rather still to lie alone
my Maidenhead will not load me.

Man. What is the cause, my Dear, of this
you should be so offended,
If I have spoke any thing amiss
it shall be straight way amended:
But what I speak is from my heart
meaning no harm to do thee,
Then let all sorrows from thee part,
for my mind is still to woo thee.

Maid. I see sorrow with you is rife,
and joy does much refrain ye
But if I should become your wife,
pray, how would you maintain me:
That is a thing to consider on,
If love I should afford ye;
Yet rather still to lie alone
my Maiden head will not load me.

Man. To maintain thee, my hearts delight,
I Will do my best endeavor;
I Will work for thee both night and day,
and I Will forsake thee never.
In wealth and woe on thee I Will tend
so thou wilt set no man above me;
My person thy life it shall defend,
for dearly I do love thee.

Maid. Well if you do but say and hold,
what you do want I have it,
I have seven hundred pound in gold
thou shall quickly crave it;
All this to thee I Will freely give
and never more forgo thee,
But ever after while I live,
I Will prove a good wife to thee.

Man. He straight way took her by the hand,
and a loving kiss then gave her,
Quoth he, I am at your command
to do my best endeavor.
Now I am thine and thou art mine
in spite of stormy weather,
So they both took hand in hand,
and both went home together.

Man. Let all Lovers think on this,
and be no more offended,
And those that have done amiss
strive in love to mend it.
For my own part I gained a love
the truth I will not smother,
Though I was poor, yet she was rich,
t'on will help out with the other.

FINIS.
