The Two Loyal LOVERS, Sweet William and Coy Susan.
William in Love but Susan was Coy,
And would not yield at first to be his Joy,
But at last to rid him out of pain,
She granted to him Love for Love again.
To the Tune of, Let Ceasar live long,
Licensed according to Order.





WEll met my sweet Susan, whom I do adore,
I have not beheld thee this twelvemonth and more,
I never expected to see thee again,
Ah I how can you slight me with scorn and disdain?
Love wast thou but loyal, I happy should be,
For every moment my thoughts is on thee.
My Love is entire in Susan my dear,
But who would a thought to have met with thee here?
Sure Fortune affords a favor in this,
To send thee my Jewel, in every kiss
Create a desire more happy to be,
For every moment, etc.
In thee my sweet Creature I place my delight,
For thou art adorned with Beauty so bright,
That none can excel thee since thou art so fair,
Be kind and not cruel, for woeful despair,
May ruin thy Lover, whose sorrow you see,
For every moment, etc.
There Is many a Damsel would fain be my Bride,
Young Nelly, and Nancy, and Sarah beside,
Nay Prudence, and Dolly, likewise honest Joan,
All these I must tell you, for me make their moan,
But I am thy Captive and cannot be free.
Since every moment my thoughts are on thee.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.
I pray you be quiet sweet William, she said,
I am not a weary of living a Maid:
For Housekeeping is chargable, Rent it is dear,
I do not intend to be Married this year.
Take this for an answer, and keep your self free,
And let not your fancy be fixed on me.
For should we be Married, we soon may enlarge
Our grief, with our sorrows, our trouble and charge,
Besides I must tell you, it is not for a day,
A Month, nor a Year, but for ever and aye:
Therefore be advized, and keep your self free,
And let not your fancy, etc.
Let none of those Iealousies trouble my Dear,
For I will provide for thee, Love, do not fear,
I daily will by my industrous care,
Provide for my Jewel, no labor I Will spare:
Then prithee de loving and let us agree,
For every moment, etc.
And though it is true, we may have no great store,
Yet if we can keep but the Woolf from the door,
With what I do earn, for I Will carefully save,
And doing of this love, what more would we have
But to live in love, and likewise Unity,
For all my delights are now fixed on thee.
Now when he had told her his honest intent,
She could not deny him, but gave her consent:
Their love in abundance they freely revealed,
Though once she denied him, at length she did yield
To be his most tender and dear loving Spouse,
With many sweet Kisses they sealed their Vows.
FINIS.
