THE West Country Nymph Or the Loyal Maid of Bristol.
The Flower of Bristol does complain
For the absence of her Love
And vows she constant will remain
Like to the Turtle Dove.
Tune, Young Jammy.
Fidelity

Piety

Loyalty





COme all you Maidens fair
and listen to my Ditty
In Bristol City fair,
there lived a damsel pretty
She to a Seaman was engaged
him she did love most dear.
And when the roaring Billows raged
her heart was filld with fear.
When stormy winds did blow
she sorely was oppressed
Her countenance did show
that she was much distressed
Quoth she you goods what do you mean
to fill me thus with fear
Such storms as these weve never seen
but yet preserve my Dear.
For I will constant be
and ever faithful to him,
Thrice happy shall I be
if ever I live to view him
But should he dye and not return
as I do greatly fear
I with the Turtle Dove will mourn
for my beloved Dear.
For he is in mine eye
the glory of this Nation
And at his constancy
I stand in admiration.
It would my heart most joyful make
to see my love appear
Which now with fear does sadly ache
for my beloved dear.




You that are cros'd in Love
my happiness admire
My dear does constant prove
what can I more desire
I Will go and stand on Dundre Hill
to see his ship appear
Where by my self i will weep my fill
for my beloved dear.
But if by cruel fate
my true love should miscarry
Who could my grief relate
in Bristol i would never tarry.
To some strange Deserts I would fly
and wander far and near
With woeful screeks to pierce the sky
for my beloved dear.
But yet my Love so kind
I think the duce was in thee
To leave me here behind
and Sail unto Virginny,
Make have and home return again
or I shall dye with fear
For my poir sake now leave the Main
mine own beloved dear.
Did thou the torments know
that I have long endured
It would procure thy woe
i am certainly assured,
You Are unacquainted with my pain
my sorrow and my fear
Oh then make have and come again
mine own beloved dear.
No soul beneath the Sun
has been more heavy hearted
Since my true Love was gone
and from his dearest parted
But time I hope will make amends
for all my care and fear
When we two meet like faithful friends
then will I hug my dear.
Till then I shall lament
for the absence of my true Love
And pine in discontent
I hope it is so with you love
An every day I wish for thee
to banish all my fear
O quickly come and comfort me
my own beloved dear.
