The CASE of RICHARD HUTCHINSON, Esquire AGAINST Sir ELIAB HARVEY, Returned to
Serve as Burgess for Malden, in the County of Essex, in the Place of Sir Thomas
Darcy, Deceased.
Appointed to be Heard on the 10th Day of January.
SIR Eliab, according to the Poll declared by the Bailiffs of the Town, had
Voices 159

Richard Hutchinson, Esquire 127

Of these, Sir Eliab had Freemen made contrary to a Known, Unrepealed By-Law 73

The aforesaid Richard Hutchinson Esquire of such Men, only 2

So that Sir Eliab had, Legal Voices, but 86

And the said Richard Hutchinson, Esquire 125

According to which, the abovesaid Richard Hutchinson Esquire had a True Majority
of 39

Besides, Sir Eliab had Minors 3

The said Richard Hutchinson Esquire had also a greater Majority than as aforesaid,
if the 16 Clergymen who Voted for Sir Eliab, and the other Freemen made on
purpose to Vote for him, since the Death of Sir Thomas Darcy, (Some of which
were made since the Delivery of the Precepts) were set aside.

However, The Foul and Partial Practices of the Bailiffs, in Giving Honorary
Freedoms to them that would promise to Vote for Sir Eliab, and denying Freedoms
to them who had Right to be Made Free, unless they would make such Promise; And
in delaying the Election for near a Month, at Sir Eliab's Desire, in suffering
him to appoint the Hour of Proceeding to a Choice, and to govern the Court at
the Poll, which was called over according to a List contrived to serve him, in
Overruling all Just Exceptions, and absolutely denying a Scrutiny, though
demanded, and insisted on: Together with the Bribery, Menaces and Force used on
that Side, it is conceived, will be sufficient to make void Sir Eliab's
Election, if the aforesaid Richard Hutchinson, Esquire had not a True Majority, as
above.
