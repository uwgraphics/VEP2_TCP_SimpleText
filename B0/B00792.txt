Glad tidings from Heaven: OR Christ's glorious Inuitation to all Sinners,
wherein is described the misery of his Manhood, and the bitterness of his
Passion endured for Man: With sundry reasons inferred, to move Worldlings to
repentance.
To the tune of the Doleful Shephard, or Sandy Soil.


AWake from sin, vain man awake,
Unto repentance thee betake:
Thy Savior calls, O come to me,
And I will ease and comfort thee.
My Father as the Scripture says,
Delights not in a Sinners death:
And therefore has sent me his Son,
That sinners all to me might come.
Then come to me, it is only I,
Can help thee in thy misery:
It Is I can wash thy fonle offense,
And cloth thy soul with innocence.
And that thou may assured be,
What pains I have suff'red for thee;
Attend give ear, and listen well
Unto the things that I shall tell.
First being God, I did become,
A man, nay worse, a scorn to some,
Was loved of some, despised of most,
Still on the sea of sorrows tossed.
No sooner to this world I came,
But Herod would my life have fane,
And wheresoever I did fly,
I was not free from misery.
Cold, hunger, thirst, sad grief, and pain,
And all that frailty does sustain,
My humane nature brought to me*
All this I felt, O man, for thee.
Sad sighs, deep groans and sweating blood,
I did endure to do thee good:
So terrible my torment was,
That once I would have had it pass.
And to conclude the Tragedy,
Of all my woeful misery:
The Jews at their high Priests command
Did come and take me out of hand.
Next was I brought to Caiphas Hall,
There to appear before them all:
And at length decreed it was,
That I must suffer on the Cross.
But first they did there all agree.
With whips to scourge and punish me,
Which being done, then presently,
I was conuey'd to Caluary.
Where to augment my misery,
They nailed me upon a Tree:
And cause I should not want disgrace,
Between two thieves I had my place.
And being crowned with thorns sharp,
Each one would flouting at me carpe.
And he was counted there the best,
That could deride and mock me most.
This done to make an end of all,
They gave me vinegar and gall:
And lastly they did pierce my side,
Whence blood and water did proceed.
The second part.
To the same tune.


THese torments Man, I did endure,
That thou might be for ever sure,
Of life, and come with Faith to me,
That I from sin might set thee free.
Then come with Faith do not despair,
Although thy sins as crimson are,
Yet has my Blood them washed so,
That they shall be as white as snow.
If thou a murderer have been,
Or given to adulterous sin:
View David who was both and yet
Repenting he did mercy get.
If sottish drunken thou host been,
Or stained with incestuous sin:
See Lo^ who fell into that lust,
Yet by Gods love was counted just.
If thou by cursed Perjury,
Have cast they soul in leopardy:
With Peter's tears wash off they sin,
And thou with him shall mercy win.
If thou (of knowledge destitute)
My Church did ever persecute:
Do not despair, but look on Paul,
And then for mercy to me call.
The Prodigal that thriftlesse son,
Who headlong into vice did run,
Was not cast off in misery,
When once Peccaui, he did cry.
Mary a long time went astray,
Yet did her tears wash sin away:
She thought it not too late at last,
Down at my feet her self to cast.
The Thief that all his life had spent,
In sin not meaning to repent,
Did at the length obtain mercy,
Cause he with penitence did dye.
It Is not the greatness of the crime,
Should make thee think it out of time,
For to repent and on me call:
My passion can suffice for all.
For all that sorrow for their sin,
And never more delight therein:
For those that truly will repent,
For such me Father has me sent.
Then whatso'ere thou be that art,
With sin polluted, cleanse thy heart:
Come with a contrite soul to me,
And I thine Advocate will be.
Come, come, my Fathers wrath prevent,
Leave off your folly and repent:
O come to me I call again,
Let not my Passion be in vain.
Now those that fondly do presume,
Till utmost gasp, in sin to run;
Let them assure themselves of this,
That of my mercy they may miss.
FINIS.
