As for the first kind of Artists, I say,
If they have Art let me it see
In phrases of our own Country:
Namely in Arts which has been found
Into our own good Scottish ground.
If they have Art from Rome or Greece
Tell it in phrases of that Place:
And also who it there did find,
And they shall hear more of my mind.
When they describe the Comets Ray,
The Swans wing they ought to say:
They give't a name though not a nait'ne,
For Cignus, wing is broken Latin
They give this Comet a Stars name,
And places it in Stary frame.
And also names its Constellation
As if it kept a constant station.
It seems the Art has got disgrace,
Which makes the Stars to leave their place:
Scorning with them to be set down,
Or to be known for half a Crown
Or else their instruments do fail,
For things too cheap is often out-waile.
For they begin Art to set down,
And teach the same for half a Crown
Which if they could take observation
They would not so slight Navigation.
For Artists good I thus will say,
I Will show all kindness that I may;
And so will all that loves these Arts,
Both in this place and other parts.
By Mathematics first were made
The first foundation of each Trade.
I pray good Artists me excuse
For in this thing I none abuse:
For better it were them to exhort,
Then they to others be a sport.
Ja. Paterson

A Description of the Comet.
Upon the 14 day I observed this Comets ray to pass just betwixt us, and the
upmost Star in the Vulters breast, and upon the 15 day, betwixt us and the
middle brightest, and upon the 16 day, I found it to be at 6 a Clock at night in
Capricorn 17 d. 01' 30" in Latitude 14 d. 47' North, at which time the Suns
place is Capricorn 06 d. 08' 30" and the lowest Stars place is Capricorn 27 d.
55' in lat. 27 d. 10' Again 24 d. at 7 a clock at night, its place is Aquarius,
20 d. 18' 30" in Lat. 25 d. 46' North. Likewise 29 day at 9 a clock at night,
its place is Pisces, 14 d. 19' in Lat. 18 d. 20' 33" North. Again 1681. Jan. 6
day, at 6 a clock at night its place is Aries 10 d. 50' 53" in Lat. 26 d. 15'
38" North, its mean distance from the Earth is 1238911 miles, its Node
ascending Sagitarius 18 d. 21' greatest Lat. viz. 28 d. 40' 30" in Pisces 18 d.
21' Node descending Gemini 18 d. 21' which will be about Jan. 23 day, after
which you shall scarce discern it, so that I see it amongst the Orbs of the
Planets and not upon the Stary frame, as is falsely Alleged by some of our new
Artists, in whom the Vulgars put much trust, and yet they will have it between
us and the Moon, which is impossible: Yet these Observations I have made, and
will approve of them as reale; As also the Long. by Celestial observation,
although there be many who profess to be Artists and yet knows little of Art,
but only a few Latin and Greek phrases on it, holds it impossible, because
they know no better; and yet there is other good Artists, who although they
have it not, believes it to be true, knowing that Art may produce many things.

Advertisement.
Such as desire any Mathematical Instruments made of Wood, as Scales or the
like, with the use thereof may find me over against the foot of Peebles-winde
in the Cowgate of Edinburgh, where they shall have Scales of my forming, that
shall resolve Mathematical questions both speedily and exactly.

The Use.
Having known what Moon makes full Sea in any (...) or Harbor, (as you have a
Table here of the most ^markable) you must multiply the Moons age by 4, and
^vide the product by 5, the quotient will be hours, an^ the remainders will be
5 parts of an hour, (every 5 part being 12') for the time of the Moons
southing, and a^ding 24 thereto will be her northing; very near to which add
the hours and minutes belonging to the point of flowing, and then seek the Moons
age in this Table, under the Moons age and toward the right hand you have the
hours and minutes to be substracte^ from the former sum, (...) the remainder is
(...) time of full Sea:

Moons age h. ' 1 14 16 29 0 0 2 13 17 28 0 5 3 12 18 27 0 10 4 11 19 26 0 20 5
10 20 25 0 30 6 9 21 24 0 45 7 8 22 23 1 00

I demand full Sea (...) Leith the 6 day of the Moons age? Answer, multiply 6
(...) 4, product is 24, which divide by 5, quotient is 4 and (...) 48' to which
ad 2 h. 15' belonging to NEBN or SW^^ for Leith, sum is 5 h. from which
substract 45' found in (...) last Table, remainder is 4 h, 18' true time of
full Sea Leith required.

FINIS.
