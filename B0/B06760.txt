A Warning for Maidens
To the Tune of, The Ladies fall.
YOu dainty Dames so finely framed
in beauties chiefest mold
and you that trip it up and down,
like lambs in Cupids fold;
Here is a lesson to be learned,
a lesson my mind,
For such as will prove false in love,
and bear a faithless mind.
Not far from Notingham of late,
in Clifton as I hear,
There dwelt a fair and comely maid,
for beauty without peer;
Her cheeks were like the Crimson rose,
yet well we may perceive,
The fairest Dame the falsest heart,
and soonest will deceive.
This gallant Damsel was beloved
by many in that place;
And many sought in marriage bed,
her body to embrace;
At last a comely proper youth.
young Bateman called by name,
In hope to have a married wife,
unto this maiden came.
Such love and liking soon he found,
that he from all the rest,
Had stolen away the Damsels heart,
and she did like him best;
Then plighted promise secretly,
did pass between them two;
That nothing could but death it self,
their true loves knot undo.
A piece of gold he brake in twain,
one half to her he gave;
The other as a pledge quoth he.
dear heart myself shall have;
And if I break my vow, quoth she,
while I remain alive,
May never thing I take in hand,
be seen at all to thrive.
This passed one for two months space,
and then this maid began,
To setle love and liking too,
upon another man.
Old Jerman who a widower was
he husband needs must be,
Because he was of greater wealth,
and better of degree.
Her vow and promise lately past
to Bateman she denied,
And in despite both him and his,
she utterlie defied.
Well then quoth he if it be so,
that thou will me forsake,
And like a false and forsworn wretch,
another husband take.
Thou shall not live one quiet day,
for surely I will have
Thee either now alive or dead,
when I am laid in grave,
Thy faithless mind thou shall repent.
therefore be well assured,
When for thy sake thou hear'st report,
what torments I endured.
But mark how Bateman died for love,
he finished up his life,
The very day she married was,
and made old Jermans wife;
For with a strangling cord God w^ts,
(great moan was made therefore)
He hanged himself in desperate sort
before the brides own door.
At which, such sorrow pierced her heart,
and troubled sore her mind,
That she could never after that,
our hour of comfort find;
For wheresoever that she went,
her fancy did surmize,
Young Bateman's pale and gashlie ghost,
appeared before her eyes,
When she in bed at night did lie,
betwixt her husbands arms,
In hope therein to sleep and rest,
in safety without harms;
Great cries and grievous groans she heard,
a voice that sometime said,
O thou art she that I must have,
and will not be denied.
But she as then being with child,
was for the infants sake
Preserved from the spirits power,
no vengeance could it take;
The Babe unborn did safe^ie shield,
(as God appointed is)
His mothers body from the Fiend,
that sought her overthrow.
But being of her burden eased,
and safely brought to bed:
Her cares and griefs began anew,
and fresh her sorrows bred,
And hereupon she called her friends,
desiring them to stay;
This night quoth she out of my bed,
I shall be born away.
Here comes the spirit of my love,
with pale and gashlie face,
Who, till he take me hence with him,
will not depart this place;
Alive or dead I am his right,
and he will surely have,
In spite of me and all the world,
what I by promise gave.
O watch with me all night, dear friends
but see ye do not sleep;
No longer then ye be awake,
my body can ye keep:
All promised to do their best;
yet nothing could suffice,
In middle of the night to keep,
sad slumber from their eyes.
And being all full fast on sleep,
as all unknown which way:
This childbed wife, that woeful wight
from thence was born away:
But to what place no creature knew,
nor to this day can tell:
As strange a thing as ever yet,
in any age bef^ll.
Ye Maidens that desire to love.
and will good husbands choose,
To him that ye have vowed your love,
by no means do refuse:
For God that hears all secret oaths,
will dreadful vengeance take,
On such as on a wilful vow,
do slender reckning make.
FINIS.
A GODLY BALLAD
To the same Tune
ONe year begins, another ends,
our time does pass and go,
And this to our instruction ^ends,
if we could take it so;
The Summer's hot, the Winter's cold,
whose s^^son lets us see
W^^^ ^outh is gone and we wax old,
like flowrs we (...) and die.
Men for the most part do rejoice,
when sons are to them born;
Whose weeping eyes bewail their woes
our sinfulness to scorn:
They are the messengers of death,
our time is passing fast;
T^l^ the hour of fading breath,
then death us parts at last.
Thus must we learn to spend our days
in virtue as we ought:
In doing good make no delays,
let sloth out of our thought:
The sloathful man yet never attained
to honor, wealth nor fame;
But many have by virtue gained
a ^ong long lasting name,
In prime t^me of our youth we should,
the se^ds of learning sow,
(...) our vices, if we could,
and sinful lusts down throw
He that in time of youth takes pain,
his virtue to bestow
In harvest of his age again,
he grapes of grace shall mow.
Since all things creat have an end,
nothing but fame remains:
Happy is he can wisely spend
his time in virtuous p^ins:
For soon the time shall pass away,
and pleasures shall abide
O happy happy thrice are they,
who takes time at the tide.
The tide of time does flow full fast,
and quickly ebs away:
And if our ship lack sail or mast,
our voyage must delaie:
Our bodies are the brittle bark,
which sails the fl^ods of fame;
But if through sloth we miss the mark,
we sink in seas of shame.
Occasion she has bair before,
but she is held behind;
Lost time no travel can restore,
as many fools do find:
The little ants and honey bees,
in Summer lay up store,
For to provide for Winter st^rms,
men ought to do much more.
This have I done to please your will,
now let me have my ^ire;
I have bewra^'d my want of skill
in doing your desire:
The weakness of a woman's wit,
is not through natures fault,
But lack of education fit
makes nature often to ^alt
