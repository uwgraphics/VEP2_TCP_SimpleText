WHereas the Militia are by special Orders of the Government actually Employed
in defense of the Country, and many of them excuse their Attendance, upon
pretense that they are already Inlisted in the Army, or intend to be so: which
we conceive very prejudicial to Their Majesty's Service. We do therefore
prohibit all persons whatsoever now arrayed in the Militia, from Inlisting
themselves in the Army, without the special License of One of Us. And all the
Officers of the Army are desired not to entertain any of the Mitia in their
Troops or Companies without the consent of the Colonel and Captain to whom
such person belonged

Dated at CORK the 25th. Day of June, 1691. Rich. Cox. John Hanmer.
