The honest Maidens loyalty
OR, The young man's faithful constancy.
He vows to endure the Wrack and the (...)
And suffer dearly for his true loves sake.
To a pretty new Tune, Or, were thou more fairer.




MOst early in a morning fair
a young man sung this solemn quire
Where his dear sweeting did use to lie,
and thus lamenting he did cry,
Farewell sweet heart, for I must be gone,
but i will have my love, or i will have none.
Set forty thousand all arow
there is none can make so fair a show
For in the Palace of her twinkling eyes,
I see how amorous Cupid flies.
As for my part I have chosen one,
And i will have my love, or i will have non.
No rack nor stack with tortures great
that shall my love entire defeat,
I do not waver like the turning wind,
but bare a lovers constan^ mind.
As for my part, etc.
(...) can love so true as I,
(...) so sick yet cannot dye.
(...) kiss can (...) heart (...)
and make a lov^-sick man alive.
As by experience is well known,
And i will have etc.
A Lady in her highdegree,
her lofty mind cannot fanc y me:
For many are ambitious in there ways,
but maidens chaste young men should praise.
I will be faithful to mine own
For i will have etc.
Your City Dames with mincing feats
have many tricks, and fine conceits:
But my true love is virtuous, chaste and wise
and like an Angel in my eyes.
As for my etc.
Into some far Country i will go,
confine myself to care and woe.
Til fickle fortune do please to smile,
that has so lo^red all this while.
As for my part I have chose one,
And i will have my love (...) i will have non.
The second part,
to the same tune.


But mark how Bateman died for love*
he finished up his life,
The very day she married was,
and made old Jermans Wife.
For with a strangling Cord, God wot,
great moan was made there fore.
He hanged himself in desperate sort,
before the Brides own door.
Whereat such sorrow pierced her heart
and troubled sore her mind
That she could never after that,
one day of comfort find:
For wheresoever that she went,
her fancy did surmise,
Young Batemans pale and ghastly ghost,
appeared before her eyes.
When she in bed a nights did lie,
between her Husbands arms,
In hope thereby to sleep and rest,
in safety without harms:
great cries and grievous groans she heard
a voice that sometimes said,
O thou art she that I must have,
and must not be denay'd.
But she then being big with Child,
was for the Infants sake
Preserved from the Spirits power,
no vengeance could it take:
The Babe unborne did safely keep,
as God appointed so
His Mothers body from the Fiend,
that sought her overthrow.
But being of her burden eased,
and safely brought to bed,
Her cares and griefs began anew,
and further sorrows bred:
And of her friends she cid increase,
desiring them to s^ay,
Out of my bed quoth she this night
I shall be borne away.
Here comes the Spirit of my Love,
with pale and ghastly face
Who till he takes me hence with him,
will not depart this place:
Alive or dead I am his right,
and he will surely have,
In spite of me and all the World,
What I by promise gave.
O watch with me this night I pray,
and see you do not sleep,
No longer that you be awake
my body can you keep:
All promised to do the best,
yet nothing could suffice,
At middle of the night to ke^pe
sad slumber from their eyes,
So being all full fast asleep,
to them unknown which ways
The Childbed Wife that woeful night,
from thence was borne away:
But to what place no cre^ture knew,
nor to this day can tell,
As strange a thing as ever yet
in any age befell
You Maidens that desire to love,
and would good Husbands choose,
To him that you have vowed your love.
by no means do refuse:
For God that hears all secret Oaths
Will dreadful vengeance take
On such as of a (...) Vow
do slender rekoning make,
Finis.
