Amintor's Answer to Parthenia's Complaint, Or, The Wronged Shepherds
Vindication.
This answer to the Nymph he does return,
Since that he has more cause than she, to mourn
And so against all women does complain,
For having met with some who were to blame:
As by this Satire you may find it when
he proves that Women are more false then men.
To a New Tune; Or Sitting beyond a River side, etc.
With Allowance.



Under a pleasant Willow shade,
Amintor sat and heard the Maid;
And unto her he did reply,
Oh why Parthenia! prithee tell me why
You do complain so grievously,
Since Men are not so false as Women be.
When as in Love we use our Arts,
We find you have obdurate hearts,
Although at first our flames do burn,
Like winters Mo^ning into Frost you turn.
So by the Consequence you see,
That Men are not so falfe as Women be.
Why should a Man confined be,
To such a piece of vanity?
Or dote upon a tempting snare,
That nature has at unawares Made fair
No, cast them off, for you will see,
That Men are not so false as Women be.
They love they fawn, they sigh, they pray,
And yet will turn to hate next day;
The more you sue, the more they shun,
By which poor Shepherds are undone:
So that by Consequence you see,
That Men are not so false as Women be.




THey think the God of Love allows,
they should be false and break their vows
It is a miracle to find
One of a thousand bear a constant mind:
Therefore you may confess with me,
That Men are not so false as women be.
They Will say they love, but not tell when,
They Will give a heart and take it again:
If you entreat, and sue and pray,
they turn their heads and look another way:
So that by consequence you see,
That men are not so false as women be.
If that they see you pine and dye,
They Will triumph in your misery,
No pity lies in frown nor life,
Their wavering minds are all so full of guile.
Therefore you may confess with me
That men are not so false as women be.
Too much experience I have had,
That few are good too many bad,
Though like a Skeleton you appear.
A cruel Nymph shall never drop a Tear
Therefore by consequence you see,
That men are not so false as women be.
Though Cupid bid them love again,
Yet they so stupid do remain
For Love they cruelty will show
And scorn for to submit unto his Bow:
So by the Sequel you may see,
That men are not so false as women be.
Then let not any Shepherd Swain,
Hereafter value their disdain,
Since O Man is so vain a toy,
We Will find some other Pastime to enjoy:
For why by this you plainly see.
That men are not so false as women be.
Their Siren Voices i will not hear,
Nor from my eyes let fall a tear:
Now Cupids Shaft I will desie,
For wounding me with Love, to make me dye
Since that you may confess with me.
That Men are not so false as women be
Thus to all Nymphs i will bid adieu,
Until I find out one that is true:
Or in some Grove i will be confined
to cure my grief, and ease my troubled mind
For now you must confess and see.
That men are not so false as women be.
