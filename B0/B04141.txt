Chiverton Mayor.
Tuesday the eighth day of December 1657.
An Order of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, against concealing and
coloring the goods of Aliens and Foreyners.
WHereas the Offices of Package, Scavage, Waterballiage, Portage, and weighing
the Goods and Merchandises of Alyens and Foreyners, do perteine unto this
City, and for the same several Customs, Fees and Profits are due, and time
out of mind have been paid to the Officers deputed to those places, and been
employed toward relief of the Poor, the conservation of the River of Thames,
the maintenance of Hospitality, and support of the Magistracy of this City, and
other public uses: And however the trade especially into foreyne parts is now
more then ever it has been in the hands of Alyens and Foreyners, who have
attained to great estates under the Government of this City, without bearing
any Charge of the same; And yet the profits of the said Offices do fall
exceedingly short of what formerly they have been, to the great hindrance of
the good uses aforesaid: The decay whereof, as this Court has understood, is
especially caused by many ill disposed and unworthy Freemen of this City, who
mindlesse of their Oaths and the Laws under which they live, do in compliance
with Alyens and Foreyners ofttimes pretend that the goods they export are their
own goods until they are on Shipboard or beyond the Seas, when in truth such
goods are for the account of Alyens, or are contracted for by Aliens or
Foreyners, and after such contract are the goods of Alyens or Foreyners, and
are liable to the said duties; And diverse other ways do fraudulently own and
color the Goods and Merchandises bought and sold, taken in or sent out, by
the said Aliens and Foreyners, some being received into partnership to color
the whole, some for hire permitting the use of their names, and others in their
own persons, and in their own names, buying, selling and negotiating, merely
for the use and account of Alyens and Foreyners, of which sort too many
Cloathworkers, Packers, and Drawers of Cloth are suspected to frequent the
Market of Blackwell-hall, and all to defraud the City of their just Rights and
Customs which by strongest Obligations they are bound to maintain; This Court
therefore resolving to put forth the utmost of their power and endeavors for
remedy of this so great a mischief to the City, and to bring upon the
Practicers of the said offenses the just shame and punishment due for their
perjury and unfaithfulness to the interest of the City, according to the Laws
and provisions in this behalf; Do require and enjoyne the several persons
deputed and entrusted in the said several Places or Offices, and whom else it
may concern, to be diligent and active in the finding out and apprehension of
any the Offenders aforesaid, and do admonish and desire all other honest and
well affected Freemen of this City to be assistant to them, and as they have
opportunity to endeavor as well the preservation of the City in its said
Rights and Duties, as to discover those of its own unnatural members, and
others that would violate and betray the same by any the said practices, to be
dealt withal and disfranchised as by Law they ought to be, and do truly
deserve.

SADLER.
