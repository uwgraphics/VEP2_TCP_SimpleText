The Westminister Lovers.
Love passion in so violent,
Beyond all opposition,
It makes poor Lovers of Lament,
That sad distres'd condition.
To the Tune of Rufield Farewell.


Fair Isabella mind me well
for now I do declare,
That all the world you do excel,
methinks you are so fair:
Then prithee grant to me my suit,
in thee I do delight.
If you deny, without dispute,
Death seizes me outright.
Ah Thomas these are tricks of youth
that I cannot approve,
To tell you now the very truth,
I fear you do not love:
A passion only you pretend,
to rob me of my Bills,
If Love no further do extend,
Oh what a shame is this.
My dearest do not doubtful be,
that I should be unkind,
I swear to be most true to thee,
and thou shall surely find:
That if you walk the flawery plain,
this long seven years and more,
You never will find a kinder Swain,
your virtues to adore.
Well Thomas, since you do protest,
your Love is so entire,
And that you do not speak in jest,
you set my heart on fire:
Methinks I feel such tickling pain
I never knew before,
And if you love me not again,
sure i shall dye therefore.


Talk not of death my nearest Love,
I love thee as my life,
And if thou will but constant prove,
then thou shall be my wife:
Betwixt my arms I Will thee embrace,
and teach thee such a trick,
Will make thy joys increase a pace,
and blisses tumble thick.
What kind of blisses do you mean,
methinks my heart does burn,
And if you should now change the scene
should forever mourn:
I feel such panting in my breast,
'till now I never did know,
With pains of Love I am oppressed,
sad pains I undergo.
Well Isabella, nor believe,
my love is so entire,
For me thou shall no longer grieve,
I Will cool thy burning fire:
Thou shall he free from care and fent,
and like a Princess Reign,
Yea, that shall be my only dear,
the glory of the plain.
Her color then did come and go,
Her lips looked won and pale,
Loves passion the did plainly show,
Which did so much prevail:
She with an amorous sigh did part,
Which Thomas minded well,
O love quoth he, this breaks my heart
Who love, my love farewell.
When Isabella sain him faint,
down to the ground she fell,
And thus she made a short complaint,
did Thomas say farewell?
It Is time for me now to depart,
and to Elysium fl^e,
Thus Isabella broke her heart,
for love did Thomas dye.
You lovers all, both great and small,
be ruled by my advice,
Into such passions do not fall,
Which proves fools Paradise:
With moderation set your love,
your lovers to obtain,
And if your lovers constant prove,
'twill quit you of all pain.
But cruel Fortune that will change,
did both their lives destroy,
She smiled at strit, at last grew strange
and did their lives among:
Both in a grave these two were laid,
that made the world admire,
Alice, or dead, the people said,
the Shepherd would lie by her.
Their Parents mourned night and day,
for their exceeding loss,
I with that other lovers may
take warning by the trass:
And not in seeming rage to go,
or from their lovers part,
This loving Shepherd he did so,
which broke his lovers heart.
