THE FANATICS BARBER. OR, A New Cut for NON-CONFORMISTS.
Being a true Relation of the PARSON that was lately Gelt at Chemsford in
Essex, being taken in Bed with another Man's Wife.

Very proper to be sung in all Corporations of this Nation. All the Town shall not
save thee.



O Women, you that can so well
Bewail your own misfortunes
Come cry with me, for man undone,
For acting 'tween the Curtains,
They say the Saracens are cruel,
And Tartars they are grim;
But fie upon Christian English man
They never did like him.
Now that I may your longing save
And set your tongues a gabling,
My song concerns a Parson; Lord!
Well men of God be dabling?
Yea verily even so it is,
For mortal flesh is frail;
And men of God like other men
Bear lechery in tail.
Ill tell it out, for Saints will cry
Give me a mare behind
If that a man must pay so dear
For boaring Woman kind.
Proceed therefore my doleful muse;
In famous Essex where,
The Town which you do Chemsford call,
and thus it fell out there.
Thus did it fall out there I say,
The Parson there did live,
They say he was a Presbyter
The which I do believe.
Quoth he unto his Neighbors wise,
My Bowels earn for thee,
Assist the feeder of thy soul
In his necessity.
Quoth she, Oh Sir, it cannot be
That I my soul should damn:
I Will warrant thee for that quoth he,
an't I thy Priest sweet Lamb?
Why did not David lie, quoth he
with wife of bold Vriah?
You I say that he was punished for it,
But that my deare's a lie a.
With that they lay down both together
as does the Lamb and Lion:
Let Us get a holy seed, quoth he,
to thwack the foes of Zion.
But oh that Butcher butcherly,
that blinking bloody butcher,
That just came in, in nick of time,
as he was going to touch her.
So Troy Town after ten years wars
was taken unaware:
And as the learned do recount,
so Moss did catch his Mare.
They say cause Butcher came so pat,
he had some private item;
Some bid him call for witnesses,
and afterward indite him.
Dite him quoth he, with irefull face,
I Will dite him with a pox;
So up he went whetting his Knife,
and straight bounc'd open the locks
Judge how the Parson looked then,
quo butcher, I come to kill ye;
With that his tool which was so crank
shrunk up into his belly.
Art thou fit others for to teach.
quo butcher then full gravely,
And do such wicked things as these!
'God all the town shall not save thee.
The Priest thought to have scared the Butcher
with a syllogism in Celarent
Tar box quo to'ther, Priests were not made
ut Butchers wives amarent.
With that he whipped the bed clothes off
and in his hand he caught um,
Quo he I Will have off every bit,
though 'twere a mile to the bottom,
O Caytiffe wretch, quo Parson then
to make my fate so heavy;
The Turk never gave so deep a wound
unto the Tribe of Levy.
Quo Butcher, pish -- so Parson lay,
in his own pickle sprawling:
Ye bitch, quo he, unto his wife,
I have spoiled your caterwauling.
Therefore all you that have long ears,
reach them unto my text,
For faith you are all so given to it,
that God knows who will be next.
For so it is now, that if ye ask
where all the saucy trade is,
Why Players among Gentlemen,
and Parsons among Ladies.
Therefore I pray you listen well
to what ye have heard this day,
First of all cause by such foul deeds
you will your selves bewray.
Secondly for that you offend
the Brethren that are weak;
Thirdly and lastly for your own
and this poor Parsons sake.
Therefore I tell ye once again
take notice of my rhyme
Write it'th' tables of your hearts;
and so much for this time.
FINIS.
