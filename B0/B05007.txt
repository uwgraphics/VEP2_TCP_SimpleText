Robin Hood and Allin of Dale.
Or, a pleasant Relation how a young Gentleman being in Love with a Young
Damsel, which was taken from him to be an Old Knights Bride, and how Robin Hood
pitying the young man's case, took her from the Old Knight, when they were
going to be Married, and restored her to her own Love again.

Bold Robin Hood he did the young man right,
And took the Damsel from the Doting Knight.
To a Pleasant Northern Tune, or; Robin Hood in the Green-Wood stood,




COme Listen to me, you Gallants so free,
All you that loves mirth for to hear,
And I will you tell of a bold Outlaw,
That lived in Nottingham-shire,

As Kobin Hood in the Forest stood,
All under the Green-wood tree,
There was he aware of a brave young man
As fine as fine might be,
as fine, etc.
The youngster was clothed in Scarlet red
In Scarlet fine and gay,
And he did frisk it over the plain,
And chanted a round delay,
and chanted, etc.
As Robin Hood next morning stood,
Amongst the leaves so gay,
There did he espy the same young man
Come drooping along the way,
come drooping, etc.
The Scarlet he wore the day before,
It was clean cast away,
And every step he fetched a sigh,
Alack and a welladay,
alack, etc.
Then stepped forth brave little John,
And Nick the Millers Son,
Which made the young man bend his bow,
When as he see them come,
when as, etc.
Stand off, stand off, the young man said,
What is your will with me,
You must come before our Master straight,
Under you greenwood Tree,

And when he came hold Robin before
Robin asked him courteously,
O have thou any money to spare,
For my merry men and me,

But five shillings and a Ring,
And that I have kept this seven long years
To have it at my wedding,

Yesterday I should have Married a Maid
But she was from me ^ane,
And chosen to be an old Knights delight,
Whereby my poor heart is slain.
whereby, etc.
What is thy name, then said Robin Hood,
Come tell me without any fail,
By the faith of my body then said the youngman
My name it is Allin a Dale,
my, name, etc.
What will thou give me said Robin Hood,
In ready gold or fee,
To help thee to thy true Love again,
And deliver her unto thee:
and tell ^er, etc.
I have no money then quoth the young man
No ready gold nor fee,
But I will swear upon a book,
Thy true Servant for to be,
thy true, etc.
How many miles is it to thy true Love,
Come tell me without any guile,
By the faith of my body then said the young man,
It is but five little mile,
it is, etc.
Then Robin he hasted over the plain,
He did neither stint nor lin,
Until he came unto the Church,
Where Allin should keep his wedding.
where, etc.
What do thou here, the Bishop then said,
I prithee now tell unto me,
I am a bold Harper quoth Robin Hood,
And the best in the North Country,
and the, etc.
O welcome, O welcome the Bishop he said
That Music best pleases me,
You shall have no Music quoth Robin Hood,
Till the Brids and the Bridsgroom I see,
till, etc.
With that came in a wealthy Knight,
Which was both grave and old,
And after him a finikin Lass
Did shine like the glistring Gold;
did shine, etc.
This is not a fit match^d, bold Robin Hood
That you do seem to make here,
For since we are come unto the Church,
The bride she shall chuss her own Dear;
the, etc.
Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth
And blew bl^sts two or three,
When four and twenty bowmen bold
Came leaping over the Lee,
came leaping, etc.
And when they came into the Church yard,
Marching all on a row,
The first man was Allin a Dale,
To give bold Robin his bow,
to give, etc.
This is thy true Love Robin he said,
Young Allin as I hear say,
And you shall be married at the same time,
Before we depart away,
before, etc.
That shall not be, the bishop he said,
For thy word shall not stand,
They shall be three times asked in the church
As the Law is of our Land,
o^ the, etc.
Robin Hood pulled off the bishops coat,
And put it upon Little John,
By the faith of my body then Robin said,
This cloth does make thee a man,
this, etc.
When Little John went into the Quire,
The people began to laugh,
He asked them seven times in the Church,
Lest three times should not be enough,
lest, etc.
Who gives me this Maid, said little John,
Quoth, Robin Hood that do I,
And he that both take her from Allin a Dale,
Full dearly he shall her buy,
full, etc.
And thus having ended this merry wedding
The Bride looked like a Queen,
And so they returned to the merry greenwood
Amongst the leaves so green,
amongst the leaves so green.
