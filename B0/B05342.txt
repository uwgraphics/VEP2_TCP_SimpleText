ACT OF PRIVY COUNCIL, Ordering Probation and Information to be sent in with
public prisoners.
Edinburgh the twentieth day of March. 1688.
THe Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, to prevent the great prejudice that
may arise to His Majesty's Service, by the not sending in probation with the
Prisoners, who are sent in to His Majesty's Prisons, and particularly those of
Edinburgh and Cannogate, whereby His Majesty's Advocat cannot know the grounds
whereupon they are to be pursued, or how to find a probation; as also the
extraordinary prejudices that daily arise to His Majesty's subjects, by being
imprisoned through Malice, Ignorance or Misinformation; Do therefore hereby
ordain all Officers of the Army, Magistrates or others who send in prisoners, to
send in to His Majesty's Advocat, or the Clerks of the Council, as sufficient
Information of their Crimes, with a full account of the Depositions of such
Witnesses, or other Probation as can be had against them; warranting the
Keepers of the Prisons, to receive none into their Prisons unless Information
or Probation be sent in, as said is, to be verified to the said Keepers, by
the said Clerks, excepting alwise such as are sent in Prisoners by order from
a Privy Counselor; To whom it is hereby Recommended, to send also an Account to
His Majesty's Advocat of their Crime, and Probation, with their first
conveniencie; and His Majesty's Advocat is hereby required to represent to the
Privy Council the Grounds and Warrands of the said Imprisonment, the very next
Council day after the Prisoners are incarcerated, as said is, to the end they
may be either set at Liberty or punished. And to the effect these presents may
be published and known; The said Lords Ordain the Macers of Council to pass to
the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and there by sound of Trumpet, make Publication
of the same, that none pretend ignorance.

Extracted forth of the Records of Privy Council, by me Mr. Colin Mckenie Clerk
of His Majesty's most honorable Privy Council.
