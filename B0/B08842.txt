A Brief Description by way of supposition holding forth to the Parliament and
such as have but common reason, wherein a true Commonwealth consists: as
also the grand enemies of this Commonwealth plainly discovered.
SUppose that ten or twelve sorts of people (being of several opinions) are
all together willing to inhabit a fruitful Island, yet before they resolve to
plant or build, they judge it necessary to have one of the wisest of them to be
their Magistrate or chief overseer, with so many servants as the time
requires, not only to keep the people in order, but also to be in a posture of
defense, against all enemies whatsoever, maintaining the same (for their
service to the Commonwealth) out of the Common stock. After this; all persons
that are of one and the same opinion are gathering themselves (as members
belonging to one body) together making up when they are separated, the number
of ten or twelve different Congregations, every one providing maintenance for
his own Ministers, and the Magistrate standing unmovable (as a center) between
them all, to keep the balance in the Government, that one sect may not
domineer over the other. If he (to wit the Magistrate) join himself (as a
member) to one particular Congregation he has his liberty to honor the same,
with his presence, with his tongue, with his pen, and with his own money: but
not with the sword or money of the Commonwealth, for he is in regard of his
Office to be considered not as a particular but as a general person standing
for the good of all: just as it is with a Treasurer, who is entrusted with a
sum of money to employ the same not for his own, or any ones private
advantage in particular, but for the benefit of all those that have entrusted
him. This now (when there are made Hospitalls for the poor; workhouses for the
idle and evil persons; as also general meeting places for the dispelling of
errors) is a true and perfect Commonwealth, without calling the Ministers of
one particular sect national Ministers. Till Satan appearing (in his
servants) as an Angel of light, does bewitch and overcome the Magistrate which
commonly happens in this following manner: The Ministers of every sect, having
their own meetings among themselves, are laboring and striving (some to a
good, and others to an evil end) to bring the greatest number of persons under
their jurisdiction: the evil minded loosing their customers, and so their
maintenance by the increase of others, the truth having most power, are
consulting together, in what manner to gain the Favor and Assistance of the
Magistrate. Appearing before him with flattering addresses and fair pretenses
calling him the most noble, most excellent, and most serene, etc. Telling him
that they have a great inclination and desire to his continuance in the
government. Thus having made their first entrance they proceed and go on (to
complish their design) insinuating him that there is a certain sort of people
under his government that very much increase being (as they call it) of
dangerous principles, because they are opposite to them: warning him with great
earnestness to take special notice of them, with this conclusion, if he do
not suppress them (to hinder their increase) that he is in danger to loose his
government. The Magistrate not perceiving that the old Serpent is hidden under
these fair pretenses, nor discerning the wolves in sheeps clothing, is moved
and resolved to reward them for all their pretended care and kindness
manifested to him, allowing them maintenance, not of his own but of the
Commonwealths money, which belongs not to him; much less to them, they then
being made partakers of the money unjustly taken of the Commonwealth, are in
fear that the honest people of the other Congregations (perceiving these
contrivings) will discover their wickedness and deceit. Whereupon they
presently resolve to extol the Magistrate in the public meeting places,
calling him a very good and religious Magistrate because he is good to them,
the Common people seeing the great union and familiarity between the
Magistrate, and those Ministers, are commonly inclined to fall in with their
affections, where the magistrate is affected, because they seek favor and
offices by him; wherein the Ministers are very serviceable to advance their own
Disciples before others in the government, that so their kingdom (their
children being brought up to the same trade) may stand upon a more sure
foundation then heretofore, giving out by the mouth of their followers that the
interest of the Magistrate lies in them, the Magistrate perceiving that not
only many of his Officers, but also the generallity of the Common People agree
with those Ministers, is easily persuaded to believe that his interest lies in
them, being now afraid to displease those cunning sophisters who by their
subtilty have brought him by degrees under their own power, being no more (as
heretofore) a servant of the Commonwealth but a servant of one particular sect
which are preparing his heart for persecution, by slandring and branding as
heretics and blasphemers, those that differ from them in opinion, to render
them odious in the sight of the Magistrate, persuading him to abuse the Sword
and power of the Commonwealth, by the persecution of such as in matters of
religion live according to their own light and understanding blameless and
without offense, till the long suffering of God, toward that hypocritical
generation is come to an end, as woeful experience has made manifest here in
England, in the bringing down of the King and Bishops, what will become of the
little-Bishops, and of them that strengthen their hands (by forcing the people
to give tithes to them) the Lord knows; the Whore (and her Daughters) have
made drunk the kings and Rulers of the earth, with their cup of fornication,
yet I hope that once the sword of justice, shall cut off the coard wherewith
the Ministers and Magistrates are tied, that so all sects (in these Nations)
being brought to the enjoyment of equal privileges, the great work of God
(which has been obstructed) may be carried on again, in more truth and power
then before, to the convincing of all Antichristian dominions, and especially
New England, where the Magistrates (being deceived by the Clergy) are become
the greatest persecutors of all those that profess themselves to be of the
reformed protestant religion, prescribing and imposing of their own rules and
forms, upon the people for their own ends, inflicting punishment upon such
whose consciences cannot endure to pay tithes or taxes, to hold up their
enemies (in spiritual matters) against themselves this now being unreasonable,
and contrary to cristianity, then equity requires, that, that law (whereby the
people are forced to pay tithes to Ministers) ought without delay to be
abolished, for we have no reason to expect a peacable Government, whilst the
Magistrate as Magistrate continues, to favor (with the sword or money of the
Commonwealth) any sect or person in particular, being the chief cause, not
only of partiality and strife in cities and countries, but also oftentimes of
war and horrible bloodsheddings which will certainly be revenged in this
life, or in the life to come, upon such as have not prevented these mischiefs
according to the power and opportunity which was left or given in their hands.

1. Leave the ministers to be provided for, by their own people that employ
them, and if by this means any that are now ministers shall become destitude;
let some course be taken to supply them during the time of their lives: but no
encouragement for any others in time to come to make a trade or merchandise of
the things of God.

2. Expel out of the Schools called Universities, the humane forms of
religion, that they may be Universities indeed.

3. Erect Schools of learning in all Cities and market Towns or other
convenient places, throughout these nations; to instruct every one as well poor
as rich that have a desire to learn Arts and Sciences to answer the ends of
nature for the Common good, for in spiritual matters the revealed will of God
is only our rule.

4. If it were the magistrates work to set up national ministers according to
their own understanding, then we should be in danger to have as many religions
as there be several ways of Government in the world, and the magistrates
changing their opinion, the whole national ministry must also as often be
changed, whereby it comes to pass, that the peoples fear toward God is taught
by the precepts of men, which makes their worship in vain, and destroys (as
much as in them lies) their souls.

5. If you accept of any form besides the holy Scripture, and set up a national
ministry according to that form, then will that shameful reproach remain, that
the magistrates and ministers in England have brought down the King and Bishops
rather to succeed in their places, then to bring the people to liberty and
happiness, for the Lord alone will prescribe both Laws and Rules for his
people to walk in; and the magistrates are to encourage and preserve them, in
all countries against evil doers.

6. Make a true distinction between England and all Antichristian Dominions; by
bringing the holy Scripture in the public meeting places (instead of the
Popes, Luthers, Calvin's, or other doctrins) upon the Throne; that so Christ
alone may be exalted, giving liberty after the reading of the same to every one
in an orderly way to declare his own mind and understanding, even as it was
among the Jews, Acts 13. excluding only such who are not willing to stay their
turn, till they are better disposed without oppressing them by imprisonment,
or otherwise, continually observing that no pre-eminence or sole privilege be
granted to any of offering any thing or of speaking first, that so every one
being at liberty and unhindred, may bring forth that, which is most conducing
to the Common welfare, all of them fitting still in silence so long afte^ the
reading of the Scripture, till any one think it fit in his judicious and humble
mind to propose somewhat, for mutual edification, endeavoring withal to make
his discourse short; that another may have his time likewise, contrary to the
custom of the common Teachers, who only or solely speaking do lengthen their
discourse to the weariness of their auditory; for which end the moderators
(who ought to be meek and understanding men) are to observe that there be due
order kept.

And for as much as the Lord has eminently appeared in these Nations to make
the people isntrumental for a general work; sounding an alarm to the nations
about it, that the powers of the earth that presume to give edicts in matters
of religion (and thereby making themselves as a beast for the whore to Ride
upon etc.) must fall in the day when God begins to arise to redeem his people
from all Antichristian powers, therefore it is good for magistrates never to
set up or meddle with any particular form or ministry composed and ordained by
the will and power of men, leaving that work only to the Lord; protecting all
such in peace and safety whom God shall raise up to do his mighty work.
