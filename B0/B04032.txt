The Life of LOVE
Let he or she, from Chains are free,
prize high their Liberty.
Loves a Disease, that seems to please
yet breeds Captivity.
To the Tune of, The Fair one let me In: Or, Busy Fame.
This may be Printed, R. P.





ALL you that do in Love delight,
now mind what I relate;
And give your judgment now aright,
of this my cruel Fate:
I loved one most tenderly,
that loved not me again:
Though I for him could freely dye,
he pays me with dsidain.
And yet upon him I must dote,
O what a Fool am I:
Though yet I love him well I know it,
it is mere Simplicity,
To mourn for him who laughs at me,
in the midst of all my pain;
When he should be most kind to me,
He does me most disdain.
Hard hay I had in this my Choice,
to meet one so unkind;
Whilst others sweetly do rejoice,
no Comfort I can find:
But sighing waste my self away,
and linger in my Chain;
I pine for him both night and day,
that does me still disdain.
This is Injustice to the height,
that Reason contradicts;
Both night and day for him to sigh
that my poor heart afflicts:
Oh! I had rather choose to dye,
then in this state remain,
It Is worse then Death assuredly,
to meet with such disdain.


WEll since I must this grief endure,
i will now resign my breath;
For being past all hopes of Cure,
I covet for my Drath:
For I shall never quiet be,
while I do here remain;
Come Death and strike immediately,
then farewell his disdain.
Then down her Cheeks the tears did run
and often she wished in vain;
For that which could not well be won,
which much increased her pain,
Come Death, quoth she, and Pierce my heart,
let me no more complain;
I long to feel thy killing dart,
since he does me disdain.
The Young-Mans Loving Answer.
MY dear you're too much unkind
against me thus to speak;
For thou shall see I will prove kind,
thy heart it shall not break:
For every tear that thou have spent,
I bottle up in store;
Believe me Love, it is my intent,
that thou should grieve no more.
No no, forbear to mourn for me,
who loves thee tenderly
I will be faithful unto thee,
and constant till I dye:
Thou art an Angel unto me,
it is thee I do adore;
In thee alone I do delight,
then grieve for me no more.
It pierced me through my tender heart,
to heart thee thus complain;
It is not in the power of Art,
to make me thee disdain:
My Love is spotless I protest,
none e're loved so before;
My dear, I do not speak in jest,
then grieve for me no more.
Let this my Love a pattern be,
to all both young and old;
Who say, they love unfeignedly.
but yet I dare be bold
To say, that many do deceive,
for scarce one in a Score,
That say they love you may believe,
but mind such Blades no more.
