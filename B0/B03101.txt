strange Effects to continue, 1654, 1655, 1656. to the Amazement of the whole
World.
To the Tune of, O Man in Disperation.


AWake, awake, O England,
sweet England now awake
And to thy Prayers speedily,
do thou thy self betake;
The Lord thy God is coming
within the Sky so clear,
Repent therefore O England,
the day that draws near.
The dreadful day of vengeance,
is shortly now at hand,
When fearful burning fire,
shall waste both Sea and Land;
And all means hearts shall fail them
to see such things appear,
Repent, etc.
The worldly wise and prudent,
shall fall besides their wits,
And wish the Hills to fall on them,
in these their frantic sits:
No succor, help nor comfort,
for them shall then appear,
Repent, etc.
The Seas and Rivers running,
shall roar in grievous wise,
The Beasts in Pastures feeding,
still strain forth grevious cries.
The Skies shall flame with fire,
the Earth shall burn so clear,
Repent therefore O England.
the day it draws near.
The glorious holy Angels,
shall then their Trumpees sound
The dead shall hear their voices,
as they lie in the ground;
Then all the Graves shall open,
and dead men shall appear,
Repent, etc.
The Devil will be ready then,
each Creature to accuse;
And show how in their life time,
they did themselves abuse;
And every man's own Consceience,
for witness shall appear,
Repent, etc.
The works of every creature,
their thoughts and deeds I say,
Shall follow them together,
in that most dreadful day:
And no respect of persons,
shall at that day appear,
Repent therefore O England
the day it draws near.


But such as have done justly,
shall wear the Crown of Life;
The wicked shall be Damned,
to sorrow, pain and grief:
In boiling brans of Brimstone,
with doleful heavy cheer,
Repent therefore O England,
the day it draws near.
But woe unto that woman,
which then with Child shall go,
And to the silly Nurses,
which do give Suck also;
When as the day of Judgment
so grevous shall appear,
Repent, etc.
And pray with tears most constant,
unto the Lord of might,
That in the frozen winter
you do not take your flight:
Nor that upon the Sabbath,
that peril do appear,
Repent, etc.
Let all good Christian people,
repent therefore in time;
And from their hearts lamenting,
each former grievous crime:
Prepare themselves with gladness,
to watch when Christ shall come;
The trump shall sound, and sudden,
and no man knows how soon:
Repent, etc.
For all things are fulfilled,
which Christ before had told,
Small Faith is now remaining,
and Charity's grown cold;
Great signs and wonders we have seen
within the Earth and Sky,
Repent, etc.
Why do thou put thy confidence
in strong and stately Towers,
Why take thou such pleasure,
in building sumptuous Bowers:
Rejoicing in thy Pastures,
and Park of fallow Dear;
Repent, etc.
Why seek thou deceitfully
to purchase treasure great,
Or why does thou through Usury,
the bread of poor Men eat?
Why does the life and living,
so filthily appear;
Repent, etc.
Wherefore let all good people
upon their knees proceed,
In making earnest Prayer
for never was more need;
That God may spare the punishment
even for his mercy mere,
And give Grace to bear in mind,
the Judgment day is near.
FINIS.
