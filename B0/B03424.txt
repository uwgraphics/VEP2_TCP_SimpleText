The famous Flower of SERVING-MEN.
OR, The Lady turned Serving-Man.
Her Lord being slain, her Father dead,
Her Bower robbed, her Servants fled;
She dressed her self in Man's attire:
She trimmed her Locks, she cut her Hair;
And therewithal she changed her Name,
From Fair ELISE to Sweet WILLIAM.
To a delicate new Tune, Or, Flora farewell. Summer time. Or, Loves Tide.


YOu beauteous Ladies great and small,
I write unto you one and all,
Whereby that you may understand
What I have suffered in this Land.
I was by birth a Lady fair,
My Fathers chief and only Heir.
But when my good old Father died,
Then was I made a young Knights Bride.
And then my Love built me a Bower,
Bedeckt with many a fragrant flower;
A braver Bower you never did see,
Then my true Lover built for me.
But there came Thieves late in the night,
They broke my Bower, and slew my Knight,
And after that my Knight was slain,
I could no longer there remain:
For my servants all from me did fly,
In The midst of my extremity,
And left me by my self alone,
With a heart more cold then any stone.
Yet though my heart was full of grief and care,
Heaven would not suffer me to despair,
Wherefore in haste I changed my name,
From fair Elise to sweet William.
And therewithal I cut my hair,
And dressed my self in Man's attire;
My Doublet, Hose, and Beaver Hat,
And a golden Band about my Neck.
With a silver Raypier by my side,
So like a Gallant I did ride:
The thing that I delighted on,
Was for to be a Serving-man.
Thus in my sumptuous man's array,
I bravely rode along the way;
And at the last it chanced so,
That I unto the Kings Court did go.
Then to the King I bowed full low,
My love and duty for to show,
And so much favor I did crave,
That I a Serving-mans place might have.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.




STand up brave Youth the King replied,
Thy service shall not be denied:
But tell me first what thou can do,
Thou shall be fitted thereunto.
Will thou be Usher of my Hall,
To wait upon my Nobles all?
Or will thou be Taster of my Wine,
To wait on me when I do dine?
Or will thou be my Chamberlain,
To make my Bed both soft and fine:
Or will thou be one of my Guard,
And I will give thee thy reward.
Sweet William with a smiling face,
Said to the King, If It please your Grace,
To show such favor unto me,
Your Chamberlain I fain would be.
The King then did his Nobles call,
To ask the Counsel of them all;
Who gave consent sweet William he,
The Kings own Chamberlain should be.
Now mark what strange things come to pass
As the King one day a hunting was,
With all his Lords and noble train,
Sweet William did at home remain.
Sweet William had no company than
With him at home, but an old man;
And when he saw the coast was clear,
He took a Lute which he had there.
Upon the Lute sweet William played.
And to the same he sang and said,
With a pleasant and most noble voice,
Which made the old man's heart rejoice.
Sweet Williams Song.
MY Father was as brave a Lord,
As any Europe did afford;
My Mother was a Lady bright,
My Husband was a valiant Knight.
And I my self a Lady gay,
Bedeckt with gorgeous rich array:
The bravest Lady in the Land
Had not more pleasures to command.
I had my Music every day,
Harmonious Lessons for to play:
I had my Virgins fair and free
Continually to wait on me.
But now alas my Husband is dead,
And all my Friends are from me fled:
My former joys are past and gone,
For I am now a Serving-man,
The End of Sweet Williams Song.
At last the King from hunting came,
And presently upon the same
He called for the good old man:
And thus to speak the King began.
What news, what news, old man (quoth he)
What news have thou for to tell me;
Brave news the old man then did say,
Sweet William is a Lady gay.
If this be true thou tellest me,
I Will make thee a Lord of high degree:
But if thy words do prove a lie,
Thou shall be hanged up presently.
But when the truth the King had found,
His joys did more and more abound;
According as the old man did say,
Sweet William was a Lady gay.
Wherefore the King without delay
Put her on glorious rich array,
And upon her head a Crown of Gold,
Which was most famous to behold.
And then for fear of further strife,
He took sweet William to his Wife:
The like before was never seen,
A Serving-man to be a Queen.
