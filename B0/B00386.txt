A New Ditty: Of a Lover, tossed hither and th^ther,
That cannot speak his mind when they are together.

To the Tune of, Hide Park.




ALas I am in love,
and cannot speak it,
My mind I dare not move,
nor nere can break it,
She does so far excel
all and each other,
My mind I cannot tell,
when we are together.
But I Will take heart to me,
I will reveal it,
I Will try her constancy,
I Will not conceal it,
But alas, but alas I do consider,
I cannot break my mind,
When etc.
Her loving looks and smiles,
has so bewitch't me,
Her virtue me beguiles,
she has inricht me,
She Is so fair, she is so rare,
her due to give her,
Makes me I cannot speak,
when etc.
Our often frequented jests,
are turned to earnest,
In 'thnight I cannot rest,
for loves severenesse,
It has turned, it has burned,
my heart for ever,
Alas I cannot speak,
when etc.
Like to the foolish Flies,
too long I have dallyed
With her bright glistering eyes,
my Fort she th^^^llied,
That I have scorcht my wings,
and heart for ever,
Alas etc.
Her presence is my joy,
her want my sadness,
When I her face enjoy,
I am turned to gladness,
And wish our company may last for ever*
but yet I etc.
The second part,
to the same Tune.




I Think she loves me well,
but I nere broke it,
I am sure I love her well,
though I nere spoke it,
And my love to her shall prove,
constant for ever,
Although etc.
Suppose she loves me not,
or loves another,
Too much yet care I not,
still I will love her,
And do vow to be true,
and faithful for ever,
Although etc.
I will do the best I can,
I Will strive to please her,
I will do any thing,
whereby to case her.
Over Sea I will flee,
swim like Leander,
Before I Will loose her love,
through the world I Will wander.
And I Will do much more too,
if she will command it,
If It be to lose my life,
I Will not gain stand it,
But alas, but alas,
I do consider,
I cannot speak my mind*
when etc.
The more I strive to hide,
the more it flameth,
These pains I cannot bide,
my wits it lameth.
And if it hidden be,
will burn for ever,
Unless I speak my mind,
when etc.
I think twere good I tried,
and went to prove her,
And lay all fear aside,
stoutly to move her,
But when I am going to speak,
my tongue does quiver,
And will not break my mind,
when we are together.
