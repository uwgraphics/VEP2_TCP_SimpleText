A Christians nightly Care.
WHen thou have spent the longsom day,
in pleasure and delight,
And after toil, and weary way,
does seek thy rest at night,
Into thy pain and pleasure past,
eke this in labor yet:
Ere sleep close up thine eyes too fast,
do not thy God forget.
But search within thy secret thoghts,
what deeds did thee he fall:
And if thou find a miss in ought,
to God for mercy call,
But if thou find nothing amiss,
that thou can call to mind:
Yet evermore remember this,
there is the more behind:
And look how well soever it be,
that thou have spent this day:
It came of God, and not of thee,
so to direct thy way.
Thus if thou try thy daily deeds,
and pleasure in this pain:
Thy life shall cleanse thy corn from weeds
and thine shall be the gain.
But if thy sleepy sinful eye,
will venture for to wink,
Before thy wilful will may try,
how far thy soul may sink:
Beware and walk, or else thy bed
which soft and smooth is made:
Shall heap more evil upon thy head,
then stroke of enemies blade.
But if thy pain procure thine ease,
in bed as thou dostly,
I Am sure it will not God displease,
to sing this soberly.
I see that sleep is lent me here,
to ease my weary bones,
As death ^t length will once appear,
to ease my grievous groans.
My daily sports with belly fed,
would cause my sleepy eye,
To sleep so sound in quiet bed,
whereby my soul might die:
The stretching arms, the ganting breath,
that in my bed I use:
Are portraicts of the pangs of death,
when life shall me refuse:
And as my bed each sundry part,
in shadows does resemble:
Then sundry shapes of death, whose dart
will make my heart to tremble:
My bed it self is like the grave,
my sheets, the winding sheet:
My clothes, the moulds which I must have
to cover me most meet.
The hungry flaes, that lowp most fresh
to worms I can compare,
Which greedily will eat my flesh,
and leave my bones right bare:
The waking Cock that airly crows,
to put the night away,
Puts me to mind the Trump that blows
before the latter day,
Then as I rise us lustily,
when sluggish sleep is past,
So hope I to rise joyfullie,
to judgment at the last.
Thus will I wake, thus will I sleep,
thus will I hope to rise.
Thus will I neither wail nor weep,
but sing in holy guise.
My bones shall in this bed remain,
my soul in God shall trust:
By whom I hope to rise again
from death and earthly dust,
All laud and praise be to the Lord,
and also to his Son
And likewise to the holy Ghost,
and so my song is done.
Sad Marshall to the singing Lark,
O Blessed bird, whose soaring Song,
declares the lightsome day!
I Am forced to bless thy little tongue,
for thy solacious Lay,
Yea, whilst I think on thine estate,
and hear thine Harmony,
I find my self to be ungrate,
who sad and silent lie;
For thou have neither Lands, nor Rent,
nor Riches laid in store:
And yet do sing as sull content,
and with thy Song do soar,
But I to whom the loving Lord
has been more liberal,
I sigh and cannot sing a word,
nor move no mirth at all.
What is the cause that I deplore,
whilst thou so sweetly sings,
But that I bunt to have much more
than yet my fortune brings:
But thou into thy mind's at rest,
contented with thy Lot:
Whilst I with cares am thus oppressed,
thou chant'st a cheerful note,
The mean to move me unto mirth,
then is to be content:
And eke with thee to leave the Earth,
and pierce the Firmament;
For here below is nothing else,
but cross, with changing toys,
But they that in the highest dwell
have everlasting Joys.
My blessed bird, tire not thy tune,
move on thy music sweet,
For I with cares was quite undone,
till thou revived my Spirit,
And now, since thou have me restored,
with thee I Will soar, and sing:
Giving all laud unto the Lord,
my high and heaven lie King
Finis, quod Marshal.
The Reply of the Lark.
O Man! sigh on, for thou have cause
to sorrow for thy sin,
GOD unto me has given no Laws,
to lead my life therein:
But by his will be me ordains,
to sing, and show the day:
But thou, O man! who grief sustains;
should bow thy knee, and prey.
Man! thou should be more sad than I,
more dangerous is thy state:
The world, the flesh, and old ^^^by,
thou have with to debate.
High is the pryze, if thou take care,
that GOD shall to thee gi^^
Hard is the case, if thou despa^^^,
or yet secure lie live.
Short while thou have for to d^plore:
far shorter I to sing.
A year, or two, or little more,
to me my date shall bring,
And when the winter waxes bold,
my lays shall lurk full lov:
For I must shield me in some hold,
till brumal blasts o'reblow.
Yea, fragrant flowrs in summer fair
shall then both droup and die:
Fish in the floods, fowls in the Air,
have their adversity.
For every time is not the Spring:
no state stands ay at ones
There is a time for us to sting,
a time for sighs and groans.
Take every state to come from God,
both wealth, want, weal, and woe,
And when he lays on thee his Rad,
thy visitation know:
Yea, when he makes thy cup to flow,
think on adversity:
Lest that thy wealth thy wit o'rgrow;
in thy prosperity.
Yet le^ no sadness thee o'rthrow,
for trifles which thou tires:
Often whilst the earth is clad with snow,
the Sun most brig^tlie shines,
Though for un^^^wn, be not afraid
each cloud is not a shower
When grief is gone, and thou art glad,
it shall be sweet that is sour
No mortal man may climb the top
of full felicity:
We do but seldom hit our Scope,
how low soever it be,
Though thou were mounted to the hight
whereto thy thoughts aspir^s.
Some higher object out o^ sight
would kindle new desires.
Then let no world lie vanity
in vain oppress thy sp'rit,
Come. soar with me above the Sky,
to thy Redeemer sweet,
Sing of thy lasting liberty,
when all these pains are past:
Sing of thy joyful jubilie,
thou shall enjoy at last,
So shall thy wishes be complete,
to the most high degree:
So shall thy present cross be sweet,
how sour soever it be,
Then sing, and sigh; sigh and sing,
till thou enjoy that Day
Of perfect joy, with Christ thy King,
where thou shall sing for ay.
FINIS.
