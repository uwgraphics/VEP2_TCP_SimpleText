THE CASE OF THE Planters and Traders belonging to the English Sugar
Plantations.
THAT the said Colonies are a Great Improvement to Navigation, a Great Benefit
to England, by Exporting from hence thither vast Quantities of the English
Manufactures, and Importing many Useful Commodities that are Exported again to
Foreign Markets; whereby they Contribute much to the Balance of Trade, and
either bring in Bullion to England, or supply the Payments, that otherways
would require Money to be sent from hence to comply therewith.

THAT the said Collonies are under very Severe Hardships, from their Great
Losses and Misfortunes of the last, and this present War.

THAT the present High Duty on Sugars, is also a Great Injury to that Trade;
and any the least Addition thereto, will most certainly be a Discouragement to
the Industry of the Planters, and tend to the further Depopulation of the said
Islands; which consequently will be a general Loss to England and the
Navigation thereof, and highly Advance the Collonies of the Dutch and French
Nations, which thereby will be Encouraged to Increase and Improve their
Sugar-Making, and supply all Foreign Markets; and so Occasion in time, the
utter Loss of those Great Advantages that do accrue to England from the English
Collonies.

For which Reasons, and very many others that might be Offered, it is humbly
hoped, that the Honorable the House of Commons, will Agree with the Committee
in Exempting Sugars from the Two Thirds Duty.
