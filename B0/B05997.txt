STREPHON and CLORIS. Or, the Coy SHEPHERD and Kind SHEPHERDESS
He Is fearful that his Flocks should go astray,
And from her kind Embraces would away;
But she with loving Charms does him so fetter,
That for to stay he finds (...) much the better:
When Flock, and Herds and all concerns do fail.
Love must be satisfied, one will prevail.
To a pleasant new Tune at the Playhouse; Or, Love will find out the way, etc.
AH! Cloris awake,
it is all abroad Day,
If you sleep any longer
our Flocks they will stray:
Lie still my dear shepherd,
and do not rise yet,
For it is a cold Windy morning,
and besides it is wet.
My Cloris make haste,
for it is no such thing;
Our time we do wast,
for the Lark is on Wing,
Besides I do fancy
I hear the Young Lambs,
Cry ba, ba, ba, ba,
for the loss of their Damms.
My shepherd I come,
though I Am all over so
But I swear (...), not love you,
if you rise so to morrow:
For me thinks it is unkind,
thus early to rise:
And not to bid me good morrow:
brings tears from my Eyes.
O hark my dear Cloris,
before than shall weep:
I Will stay to embrace thee,
neglecting my sleep:
My flocks they may wander,
one hour, two or three:
But it I loose thy favor,
I ruined shall be.
I joy my dear shepherd,
to hear the say so:
It cases my heart of
much sorrow and woe:
And for thy Reward
I will give the a kiss:
And then thou shall taste
of a true Lovers bliss.
But Cloris behold how
bright Phoebus his Beams:
Invit's us to go
to the murmuring streams:
I bear the brave Huntsman
does follow the try:
And make the Woods ring,
yet how sluggish am I.
The Hounds and the Huntsman
may follow the Chase:
Whilst we enjoy pleasure
in a far better place:
Thou know my dear Shepherd
there is no delight,
Like Lovers enjoyment
from Morning till Night.
Was my dear Cloris,
what do thou require:
The care of my Flocks
does abate my desire:
The Lambk are new Yeaned,
and tender for Prey,
And I fear the sly Wolf.
she should bear them away,
My Love do not fear it,
the Wolf he is fled,
To take up his Lodging
in his Mossy Bed:
Then let me embrace the,
whilst we do agree:
And I Promise to go,
thou shall after be free.
Ah Cloris! the words
are so powerful with me,
That I could be willing
to tarry with thee:
Therefore to content thee,
one hour I will stay,
But I vow by God Cupid,
I will then go away.
How I have my wishes,
dear Shepherd we will part,
Although thou do carry
away my poor heart:
I bless the great Gods,
that to Lovers are kind:
To bring us together,
such bliss for to find,
Then farewell dear Cloris,
till I see thee again,
For now I will haste to
my Flock on the plain:
Where I shall record
thy true Love in such Rhimes.
For shepherds to admire
in succeeding times.
FINIS.
