The praise of our Country Barly-Brake: OR,
Cupids advisement for Young Men to take
Up this loving old sport, called Barly-Brake.

To the tune of, when this Old Cap was new.




BOth young men Maids and Lads,
of what state or degree,
Whether southeast or west,
or of the North Country
I wish you all good health,
that in this Summers weather,
Your sweet-hearts and your selves,
play at Barly-Brake together.
As it a custom was,
so let it flourish still,
Flora again has decked
your much frequented hill,
And Phoebus two divides
what Boreas pacts together,
That he with furious chides,
does not ore cast the weather.
Then since the cause so stands,
that all these think it good,
To put their helping hands,
let nothing be withstood,
Fulfill the proverb old,
your lovers in fair weather.
As well as to make hay,
play Barley Brake together.
If thy love give the stroke,
be sure have an eye
Before hand it is spoke,
then follow presently,
And if thou do him catch,
then pray for more fair weather,
That you may play a match
at Barley Brake together.
Then William loved Nan,
and that with such good will,
That they of Love must scan,
upon yon greeny hill,
Their talk is not of wealth,
but how they may persevere,
In that same love was shown,
at Barley-Brake together.
Then Thomas loved Nell,
although her friends were poor,
Her virtue did excel,
she needed then no more,
I, Nicholas then would smile,
and Phillip pleased was ever,
when they could play a while,
at Barley Brake together.
Nay Simon Frank and Steven,
with Sisly Doll and Mary
Need not to this be driven,
Nor Kate that keeps the Dary,
For with a forward mind,
not fearing wind nor weather,
She knows young men are kind,
at Barly-Brake together.
Then Harry would bestow,
wine, beer and Cakes on Bridget,
But now it is nothing so:
his Father does forbid it,
If wealthy Maids be slack,
there is few that dare show favor,
Their Fathers keep them back,
no, no, you shall not have her.
The second part.
To the same Tune.




ANd that was Cupids time,
wherein he got much praise,
For none did Usher then,
in his School in those days,
Now lust his Vshers hand,
and pride bears such a sway,
That all his shafts are burned,
that were so sweet and gay.
When as this mirth was used,
of which I now do write,
Love was not so abused
nor in so bad a plight,
As he is now adays,
for though he be no fool
Amongst his Scholars now,
he is hist out of his School.
But cheer up pretty Maids,
for now I Will leave the City,
And bring your Country blads,
unto their former pity,
And if they ever did love,
so shall they now persevere,
And you shall play like Doves
at Barly-Brake together.
It is a lively sport
to set how nimblely;
Yon need no great report,
the same to testify,
To see with sweet embrace,
each Lad his Less does clip,
And laying face to face,
does taste each others lip.
Thus are are our Country youth,
both merry too and ioyall,
If they set love it is truth,
they hate to be disloyal
And therefore in their praise,
my pen shall write for ever,
Because they love do raise,
at Barly-Brake together.
And many Pastimes more,
which long has been neglected,
Again to you is restored,
then let it be respected,
And as in tunes before,
so do you now persevere,
Then will you ever love sore
at Barly-Brake together.
Therefore you Country Maids,
that are to London gone,
Let me with fair persuades,
entreat you to come home,
If you your Love will meet,
make haste and hie you hither,
That he and you may greet,
at Barly-Brake together.
Then think not you amiss,
of this my good advise,
Nor for to take a kiss,
I pray you be not nice;
It Is Cupid does direct
you how you may persevere,
Let that be no neglect,
at Barly-Brake together.
Then will old customs come,
unto their former use,
And Love be made amends,
for this his great abuse,
That he has long sustained,
in Country, Town and City,
And lust shall be arraigned,
and none shall plead for pity.
Because he has defiled,
what Love has often united,
And so unloos'd the knot,
that Cupid so delighted,
To see in every breast,
within this Summers weather,
True Lovers never ablest,
but when they play together.
FINIS.
