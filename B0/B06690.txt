The Women's just Complaint: OR, Man's Deceitfulness in Love.
Being a most Pleasant New Playhouse Song.
Long time deceived with feigned Vows, at last,
The Females find their Coyness holds not fast;
For Man, that Noble Creature, cannot Love,
Nor fix his Soul on ought but what is above:
It Is Everlasting joy he Centers on,
And leaves soft Fools, Women to dote upon;
Which once they finding, seem to loose their Care
Of hopes they had, and fall to flat despair.
To a pleasant New playhouse Tune, much in request.


O Love thou art a Treasure,
could Constancy remain,
But for an hour of Pleasure,
we feel an Age of Pain:
How eager is the Lover.
But when his Ioys are over,
Poor Women do discover,
the vow of Men are vain:
Poor Women, etc.
In vain are all their Swearings,
it is but your Love to gain,
In vain their promised Fairings,
their Lusts for to obtain:
T^eir Cringing and the^r Bowing,
Is worse t^en Thee and Thouing,
Poor Women find the Vowing
of men, is all but vain:
Poor Women, etc.
In v^^n their mean and Carriage,
their promised Love they feign,
In vain they promise Marriage,
maids honors for to stain:
In vain their Songs and Dances,
Plays Masquerades Romances,
Poor Women find the Fancies,
and vows of men are vain:
poor Women, etc.




All Wedlock ties Defieing,
when once their Wills they gain,
Scoffing at, or denying,
what once did cause their pain:
When with a thousand Kisses,
And with as many Wishes,
Poor Women they with blisses,
deceived, which vows are vain:
Poor women, etc.
And whosoever believes them,
they snare them it is most plain,
And when they are took, deceive them,
and leave them to complain:
Whilst we poor Fools at Mourning,
They our Griefs are scorning,
Poor Women then take warning,
for men are false and vain:
Poor Women, etc.
They breath false sighs to win us,
and Counterfeit Loves pain,
And into Bonds they bring us,
with Flatteries so vain.
By praising of our beauties;
And Swearing it is their Duties,
Poor Woman while she mute is,
but find at last all vain:
Poor woman, etc.
Much like to Airy Vapors,
are all the Vows they feign,
Or like Expiring Tapours,
that never will burn again:
But leave us in deep Sorrow,
For joys we did but borrow,
Poor Women bid Good Morrow,
and leave us to Complain:
Poor Women, etc.
It Is sure the God of Lovers,
made not his Laws in vain,
He better joys discovers,
and makes his precepts plain:
Why them should man delude us,
When he has so Judas'd us,
Poor Women why be screwed thus,
on things we cannot obtain:
Poor women, etc.
Let us then be contented,
let Lordly still remain,
For him he was invented,
let us not wish in vain:
For what though we endeavor,
Yet can deserve him never,
Poor Women wishing ever,
yet all our wishes vain:
Poor women, etc.
Then let us be contented,
and strive no more with pain,
Least we at last repent it,
and past all hopes, Complain:
When there is no Relieving
But still we must be grieving
Poor Women, by deceiving,
men show their vows are vain:
Poor Women, etc.
