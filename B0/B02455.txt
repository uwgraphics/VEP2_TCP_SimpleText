The Crafty BARBER of Debtford
You Debtford Women all beware of this same Crafty Barber:
For when he gets between your Arms There he takes up his harbor.
Tune of, Daniel Cooper.




^ COme and hear my pleasant Song
all you that would be merry:
For unto you it does belong
that are both brisk and airy:
A Barber lived in Debtford Town,
^elieve it is no Lie sir,
He loved well a bit of the brown,
and a Nurse to turn him dry, sir.
Another man lived in the Town,
and he did use to fiddle;
The Barber loved his Wife also,
and paid her Tarradidle.
But he (poor man) was gone to Sea,
and little did he think, sir,
That his poor wife would wanton be
and with the Barber drink, sir.
But on a time it happened so,
the Barber he did quarrel;
For there is Virtue you do know
that lies within the barrel
Will make an Did Man bear up brisk,
and overcomes the Youth too,
This got into the Barber's crown,
and made him tell the truth too*
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.






BEfore the Justice he was had,
who questioned him severely;
Which made the Barber almost mad
and he confessed clearly
That he drank in a bawdy house
and that full well he knew sir;
'Twas asked, How? and he confessed
that there he lay with two sir.
The Justice asked him who they were?
and straitway he confessed,
A long-back'd Nurse that lived there,
he plainly did express it:
A very gentile Dame was she,
and wore her clouded Stockings;
But some there are do think that she
got such fine things by knockings.
The Fiddlers wife was fine and neat,
and decently attired;
And she full well could do the feat
the Barber often desired:
He often embraced her in his Arms,
and caught her by the thing too;
So that she won him by her Charms,
and he touched the Fidler's strings too.
He had an opportunity
I pray sirs understand ye:
The Hostess she was sitting by,
and tope'd her Nose with brandy,
While he did please his Ladies fair
and trimmed them both so nearly,
That she did wish to have a share,
he did it so completely.
Think it not strange what now you hear,
for if you will believe it,
The Barber loves the sport so dear,
I doubt he never will leave it:
Still Robin Red-breast is content,
that little sneaking fool too,
He accounts it all but merriment
to catch his Wife by the Tool too.
And Maycrill-back she is so fine,
there is few that can out-brave her,
And when she drinks a Glass of Wine,
the Barber he does shave her;
And up and down where e're he goes,
he mightily does praise her;
A gentle hand he has she knows,
and well she likes his Razor.
And now good people to conclude,
my thinks it is a pity
The Barber should these two delude
that are so neat and pretty.
Then women all pray have a care,
for Barber's minds are waving;
And now methinks he is had his share,
he may leave off his shaving.
