E vapurs wak and warters in the air
e Seyis sa deid, e fludis and Fontanis fair
Heir my complaint to ow my case I mean
That e may wellis gif to my febill Ene
To testify with teiris my woeful case
And with our murning weid absconse my face.
My husband deir good Iohne the co^moun weill
To quhome I did all my affairis reueill,
As he to me did in our faithful dayis
But fraud, or gyle or tressoun any wayis,
Than lusty gay and flurisching were we.
True faithful Children he begat on me
Sic lufe and faith to other they did beir,
That they knew not quhat beist was Civil weir,
My heid wald not disdane my leggis and feit,
My Eine foirsaw all perrallis micht me meit,
My hands and arms ay reddy to defend me,
To snib my Children gif they did offend me,
My body was weill cled with Policy,
My Hat was of Justice and Equity,
My Collar of true Nichtbour lufe it was
Weill prenit on with Kyndnes, and solas.
My Bluiffis were of fre Liberality
My Sleiffis were of, to borrow and len glaidlie,
My Lais and Maileis of true parmanence,
My Stomak maid was of clean Conscience.
My waist was gyrdit with Sobriety,
My Legs and feit schod with Simplicity.
My heart was haill, my stomach weill disposit,
Of piece and rest my Bowellis were composit.
Quhat wald e moir Schir commoun weill and I
Held house lang time, bot Satan had Inuy
To se us so, than callit he Seditioun
With pride his Sone to quhome he gaif co^missioun
To tak with them discord and Nichthour feid
(After I mean that our good barnis were deid)
To poysoun me with their Infectir crime,
With sum of my awin Children of this time,
Of quhilks I pray the Lord God make me fre,
Ambitioun will not lat them aggre,
Their money eiris they have me disconfortit,
I travel it as I had them aduortit,
The malice greit that ilk to other beiris,
Dois ryfe my bowels with their Civil weiris,
Sair boistit they my husband commoun weill,
And maid their vowis with aithis him for to Keill.
In any part quhair they him with me fand
Quhairfoir, for feir he fled from me Scotland.
Away sum sayis to Veneis is he gone,
Or to the Swisches as they do suppone,
Quhair he is saif from danger, hurt, or skaith,
Heir wald he deit of cauld and hounger both,
Thus am I left as wedow in distres,
For commoun weill, my bairnis left Fatherles.
Children I had in all vertewis porfyte
To piece, and Justice was their haill delight.
Sum of displesure deit for woe, and cair,
Sum wyrteit was, and blawin in the air
And sum in Stirling fchot was to the deid,
That mair was geuin to piece nor Civil feid.
Bot ane was slane unto my skaith and schame,
Because he socht to fetch my husband hame,
He was my deir and best belouit Sone,
All that he did for my weilfair was done,
Like ane good Medciner or good Syruge,
Of evil humouris he did my body purge,
Quhat wald e moir sen James in Falkland deit,
Nane for my weill, sa weill with me aggreit,
Nor it sa weill did lufe Schir Commoun weill,
Nor unto me bure sic ane fervent eill.
Murdreist he was in Lythgow tratrouslie,
The murtherars unto my beid did fle,
Quhair they tuik hald, and it dois hald them fast
And ay sensyne my heid hes been aghast,
For quhy throw falser and Subtillitie,
They chaist away Justice, and Equity,
For laik of quhilks my heid dois wark and aik,
And all my body trymbill, dois and schaik,
For quhen the heid is seik the Proverb is
That all the members be the worse I wis.
My claiths ar reuin that piety is to se,
Particular weill hes spuileit Policy,
My Collar rent is be Dame Fremitnes,
The Prenis thairof ar reft be sad Nysenes,
Dame Nigartnes my Gluifis hes hint away
Iak for him self my Sleifis dois reist and stay.
My Lace and Maileis taken be variance,
My Stomak worn is be dissimulance,
My belt is cuttit of pure Gluttony
My legs and feit now schod with Poverty
My heart is seik, my stomach keipis na meit
My bowels Rumbills, as they wald other eit.
Now for to cover all this vilannie
Ane Cloik they gif me of authority,
Authority (alaik) na les they mean
For they desire never to se their Queen,
Bot that they may in her Name bruik offices
With power to cleik up the benefices.
Nane I excuse on ather side, for quhy
Ilk ane his awin house seikis to edify,
And nane dois cair for Commoun weill ane Prene,
I grant I had ane Douchter was ane Queen
Both good and fair, gentill and Liberal,
Dotit with verte wis and wit Natural,
Prignant in Spreit in all things honourabill,
Lusty good like, to all men fauourabill.
Schamefull to evil, both honest meik and law,
Their vertewis all, scho had quhyls scho stude a^
Of God Eterne, as of her Governor,
And quhen scho did regaird her hie Honor.
Bot at the last throw filthy speiche and countell,
That scho did heir of sum cursed Rittie vnsell,
Fra scho gaif eir to sir vile bawderie
God, Schame, and honor, scho forret all three
It were to lang the vices to reheirse
Quhairin from thine scho did her self exerce.
The Reider wald them think may Insolent,
Bot I them leif because they ar Recent.
For quhilks scho was thocht unworthy to King
Ane Crown to bruik, or any Royal thing.
Sa all my Children with her awin consent
Deposit her in oppin Parliament
Than wald scho that they should her awin sone crown
Quhilk thing they did, sa Syce up and Sink to down
God save his grace, for quhy the same is he
In me that hes the true authority.
Praisit be God I have ^re at command
That fair oung Prince, in Stirling my richt hand*
Were not in hope I leif to se that day
That he sall purge their foull humburis away,
And me restoir agane unto my health,
ea, cause my Children flurifche in all wealth.
Were not he is brocht up in all good thing
Affeiring to ane Godly Prince and King,
Be good Lord Deddy my true faithful friend
Cum of ane race of men to me may Kind.
For Lady Minnie I dar ^ak in hand
Happy is he hes sic ane Gouernand.
Were not their things, that maks me leif in hope
At I ^ertie to se this Lyonn scope,
One day to Rore, and Ramp upon his fois,
To bring them law, that now sa proudly gois,
Were not their thingis I say and otherrs mo
I wald dipair, and die for pane and woe.
To ow Vapouris and watters in the air
And sey is sa ^eip, I down my plaint declair,
e sey is I say, gif passage and e can
Till sum Faithful to bring hame my good man.
And e my Kirk my Faithful Mother deir
That purgit art of Channoun, Monk, and Freir
Of Papist Priest, Papist and Papistrie
Bot not assace, clean of Hypocrasie,
Of avarice, pride and ambitionn
Thocht e have left all Superstitioun.
I grant the word of God is trewlie Preichit
And in the schuills Exercise trewlie teichit,
it sayis the Commounis e do not our office,
For vpaland they have not dew service.
The rowmis appointit pepill to confidder
To heir Gods word, quhair they should pray togidder
Ar now conuertit in scheip Coits and Fauldis,
Or else ar fallin, because nane them vphauldis.
The Parische Kirks I mean they sa misgyde
That nane for wynd and rane thairin may bide.
Thairfoir na pleasure tak they of the tempill
Nor it to cum quhair nocht is to contempill,
Bot Crawis and Dowis cryand and makand beir
That nane throuchly the Minister may heir:
Both Fedders Fylth, and Doung dois ly abrod
Quhair folk should sit to heir the word of God,
Quhilk is occasioun to the adversaries
To mok and scorn sic things befoir our eyes.
Thus to disdane the house of Orisoun
Dois make folk cauld to their Deuotioun
And als they do disdane to heir Gods word
Thinking the same to be ane Jesting bourd,
They go to labor drinking or to play
And not to ow upon the Sabbath day,
Sa they provoke the wraith of God allace,
Quhilk hes maid me to fall in this distres.
it should I not blame ow that sic dois perische
Bot Lords and Lairds, and Co^mouns of ilk Parische,
The quhilk were wont for to cause every pleuch
In vphalding the Kirk to pay aneuch.
To do the same e should them it exhort
Togidder that they should the pure support.
The Proverb is of Palice Kirk and brig
Better in time to beit, nor after to big.
e Collegis and University,
That to all vthers should exempill be,
I se our tempills cassin down and reuin,
The may part ar bot theikit with the heuin.
This quhilk to ow I do sa planely write
The Commounis speiks of ow and dois bakbyte
Amend sic things I humblic ow beseik,
And dit the mouths of them that sa dois speik.
Making our lyfis and Conuersatiouns
To preiche and teiche like unto our persouns.
It should be e Mother should me Instruct
It should be e to Christ should me conduct.
It should be e should schaw me the richt way
How I should serve my God both nicht and day
It should be e that should do diligence
For to aggre this Civil difference.
It should be e throw Preiching should me mufe
To Cheritie and freindly Nichthour lufe,
It should be e that should gif good exempill
Of life and warks to them dois ow contempill.
It should be e that should be at all time
Clean without spot, and purgit of all crime.
It should be e Mother, it should be e
To quhome the pepill should give eir and Ee,
It should be e schortly I say no moir,
That to all vertewis should ow Indeuoir.
And e my Barrouns and Nobility
That dois oppres my pure Community,
Quhair i^ our wit, our ressoun sense and feill
To fle away my husband Commoun weill,
Quhat have e wyn sensyne, lat se our ganis?
Gar pryse our proffeit and esteem our panis,
The panis I wait, the proffeit will surmont,
A greit daill moir nor e can make our count,
I find sensyne the ow hes borne the bell,
Wyfis Masters been in giving haill Counsel.
To Lords and Lairds I speik generally
As may be seen allace ouir weill on me.
Hwine Huntly Grange, and all e of that side
Behald now how e do the matter gyde,
To cause my Sisters France and Ingland scorn ow.
That walterars of Courts e lat suborne ow,
it e and they did sweir with aithis conding
And did sybscryue to be true to the King.
In takin quhairof with all e did aggre
To Crown and place him in authority.
Gif e wirk weill our deids aue day will schaw
For raising fire aganis my actis and law,
In halding towns and strenths our King aganis,
Hutting the rest of our brether to panis,
Quhome I excuse not as I said befoir
For I persaif ambitioun and vane gloir
And gredynes, to reule dois blind ow both,
Quhilk dois redound to my greit hurt and skaith.
our tennents pleueis that they ar oppressed
Be ow and ours, that dois them soir molest,
e hicht yair maills, yair pleuchs e dowbil onyame
They tyne their time at sic things to opone yame
For na rest will e get into our rags
Gif sum sect know that they have geir or baggs,
our Nichtingaills will sing sa in our cir^^,
That e sall nichtly have Domestik weiris,
one Carle (quod scho) my Joy dois beinly dwell
And all prouisioun hes within him sell
In barn, in byre, in hall Girnell and Seller
His wife weiris weluot un her Gown and Collar,
They ar sa rich, that they do us misknaw,
Than better sone to drug nor lait to draw
Sone is his Gersum hichtit and his Maillis,
Him self growis waik, his geir and houshald faillis
Quhair sic were wont to have Guse Cok and Hen
Breid drink and bedding to treit honest men,
Now drink they Mylk, and Swaits in steid of Aill,
And glaid to get Peis breid and watter Caill,
Quhair sic were wont to ride forth to the weir
With Iak and Sword, good horse Knapscall and speir
Quhair sic were wont bravely to make them bowne
With Lord or Lord to ride to Gurrdwis town,
Quhair sic were wont at all Games to be reddy
To schuit or loup, for to exerce their body,
Now mon they wirk and labor pech and pant
To pay their Masters Maillis exhorbitant.
Ryue out the Mures, the bestialls gers inrak
They ar sa waik they dow not beir a Iak.
And gets waik bairns evil nureist in distres,
Sa be sit wayis my Commouns dois dicres
My torment sair constrynis me this to speik
Na merwell quhy, for I am wondrous seik.
Gefeiking ow my feiknes to remerd
Quhilk may be done, ceiffing our Civil feid.
To follow Christ and his Commandment,
Quha said befoir his last department
Ilk one lufe other with ^i^ freindly lufe
That e may be the bairnis of God abufe,
And cleith ow with fair Garments clean and quhyte,
Without malice, contentioun or dispyte,
Aganis my cu^ming, quhilk trewly salbe
Quhen e leist wene in twinkling of ane Ee.
Thus said the Lord to ow and to all men
That be their marks they fall Gods children ken.
Heirfoir my Nobills seik piece do that e can
To follow Christ and chais away Satan,
With his Supposts and all that taks in hand
For to divorce me from my good husband.
Now e my Burges, Craftis and Merchand men
And e my Commounis with my hynd emen,
To ow I have sum purpois for to say
How, quhen, and quhy, my husband fled away,
First their come in lurkand upon our gait
Pride and Inuy, with falset and dissait.
Quhat should they seik lang time they lay thairout.
Till ane ule euin our wyfes to counsall went.
Than spak ane Lawers wife both trym and gent,
Cu^mers (qood scho) it is piety to se
Folk in a town for cauld and hounger die,
It is mair schame in Burgh for to se beggars
Nor it is skaith in Crawmont to want dreggers.
Quhairof dois serve our greit cheir and fair bigging
Bot for to help the pure that gais a thigging?
Quhairof do is serve our husbands gold and rent
Bot to sustene the pure and Indigent?
it lar us ludge one two that gais befoir
Pride and Inuy, gif we will do no moir.
And gif our husbands speirs quhy did we so
Answer we may we left them other two.
Now gif e pleis Cummers I fall begin
This same cauld nicht to tak ane of them in,
We know them not (quod they) hot tak e ane
We must not leif the other bird alane.
Sa they did skaill, and scho tuke with her pride
And on the morn scho come forth like ane bryde,
With her new Baist als proud as ane Paycok,
And in her heart scho did her Cummers mok:
Quhilk quhen they saw, with spcid they ran in hy
And for dispyte amangs them ludgeit Inuy,
In counterfuting her in all kin things,
Courche, Collar, Cloik, Belt, Braissets and Rings.
Than wox the Lawers wife richt proud in heart
Bot it her Cummers call it scho apart,
Saying Cummers, quhat is the cause and quhy
That in dispyte of me e treit Inny?
Because (quod they) that e alone tuik pride,
And thocht that we should not march ow beside.
Thairfoir we thocht, in that point e did wrang us,
Aggre (quod scho) and ludge them haith amang us
Quhilk thing they did, and all did condescend
To treit and keip them to the warlds end.
Thus hes our wyfis their two taken to be thairs,
And left the other two for our affairs,
Quhilk seeing e and our wairs gros and grof
And with our wyfis their two so much maid of,
e gros geir left, and went for wynt and spyces,
French claith and silks for to cleith up their vices,
Quhilks for to out with dow bill met and mesure
The other tway e ludgeit at their pleasure.
Quhat wald e moir e wait weilt quhat I mean
Disinge them now and chais them from you clean
e Hammer men, e that maks schois and claiths
e treit their two with money manesworne aiths,
And e likewise all Crafts in General
Alaik I feill ow to them bound and thrall,
Mairouir our drinking Extraordinair
Maks often our wyfis and biarns evil to fair,
Quhen e wald drink in house e may be bauld
To do the same at hame with our houshauld.
All byganis mend in time to cum luik e,
Begyle na man bot wirk our wark trewlie.
To you my Commouns quhat mait can I say:
I piety you as far forth as I may,
Now pure e ar, it purer wald e be
For using proud pure Prodigality.
Their is na Lord nor Lord in all this land
Bot ye man counterfeit in claiths fra hand,
Fra top to ta, thocht ye should beg and borrow,
Iohne ga your way for it will not be forrow
e should your ground grube with Simplicity,
And make your claiths conform to your degree.
Bot ye your wife and bairns can tak na rest
Without ye counterfeit the worthyest,
Buft brawlit hois, Coit, Dowblet, sark and scho,
our wife and bairns conform mon be thairto
Leif of, and leirne your bairns to saw and teill,
Sic doings chaist away the Commoun weill.
All their foirfalts that I have done reheirs
That Lords, Lairds, Ladys, and Lawers dois exerce,
Kirk, Burges, Merchand, Co^mouns Crafts and all
Hes haill the wit of this my woeful fall.
Amend heirfoir, and call to God for Grace,
Beseiking him to gif us rest and peace.
In our life time that we may trewly know
Ane God Eterne, ane Faith, ane King, ane law,
And at the last to bring us to his gloir
To King with him in blys for ever moir. Amen.
The Conclusioun be P. R. to all and sum.
All that this reids the matter sad will think
Sum that this heiris I wait will discommendee
Thocht all and sum heir at partly do schrink
it sorry I that they should be offendit
Heirfoir I wald that this were blythlie endit
For to make all or sum lauch at the last
Than all and sum sall heir in time by past
Quhen Fornicatioun haldin was na crime
How that sum Prelates did walk pray and fast
And serve in Kirk according to that time.
A Prelat ane day in his bed to sport him
Did clap his lufe with kissis soft and sweit
In this mean time their was to recomfort him
Peirtryks and Pleuers pyping on the speit
Than up he raise, and maid him for them meit
With good quhyte wine and all the partinence
Quhen he had taken this on his Couscience
He gaif ane greit pech like ane weill fed stitk
Och Lord (quod he) now gif me patience
Quhat stres thoill we to serve thy haly Kirk*
FINIS.
