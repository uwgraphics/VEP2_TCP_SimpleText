The two Constant Lovers. Or, A pattern of true Love expressed in this loving
Dialogue between Samuel and Sara.
To a pleasant new tune.




As I by chance was walking,
on a Summers day,
I heard too Lovers talking,
and thus they did say:
With a mournful Ditty,
she began her tale,
Which moved my heart with pity,
her for to bewail.
Sara. My love I have desired,
for to speak with you,
My heart within was fired,
until that I know:
Whether you were living,
in good health or ne,
My heart it was grieved,
until I did know.

Samuel. What sweet heart what ails thee,
thus for to complain,
Let not ill befall thee,
thou shall me obtain:
Though I ^ere absented,
from thee for a space,
I Will not be prevented
of the comely face.

Sara. Samuel my own Sweeting,
I to thee must tell,
In a heavy greeting,
what has us befell:
My friends do grudge and murmur,
and to me they say;
That we must part a sunder,
or else they will thee destroy.

Samuel. My Love be not grieved,
though thy friends do frown:
Thou shall be relieved.
none shall put thee down:
I for thy sweet favor,
will adventure much,
Though thy friends and Brother,
do against me grutch.

Sara. O my own dear Sweeting,
I am grieved in heart,
That I give thee such greeting,
for to breed thy smart:
Barnwell my own Brother,
Captain being he,
Swears that of all other,
killed thou shall be.

The Second Part.


Samuel. SAra be not fearful,
though thy Brother swear;
Of thy self be careful,
I no man do fear:
What care I for Barnwell,
though he a Captain be,
He shall find that Samuel,
is as good as he.

Sara. O my loving Samuel,
look where he does go,
It Is my brother Barnwell,
now begins our woe:
Would that we together
had not met this day.
O my Judas brother,
will my life bewray.

Now comes Captain Barnwell,
to these Lovers twain,
And made count that Samuel,
he could soon have slain:
But it proved contrary
to his bloody mine,
In the sight of Sara,
conquest he resigned.
The said he to Samuel,
what do you make here?
I Am with my sweetheart Sara.
put her not in fear:
Barnwell in a fury
swore he would prevent,
His own sister Sara,
of her hearts content.
Sara. O my Brother Barnwell,
let me you entreat,
Not to wrong my Samuel,
in your bloody heat:
He has never offended
you at any time,
Let me be condemned,
save his life take mine.

A says Captain Barnwell,
Sara thou shall see,
Then he called to Samuel,
come and answer me:
I thy death has vowed,
ere I further go;
Then sweet Sara bowed,
saying do net so.
Samuel. Samuel being heedfull,
of his tyranny;
Says Sara be not fearful,
thou anon shall see:
Though thy Brother Barnwel,
vow my life to spill,
Thou shall see that Samuel,
has both strength and skill.

Now these wores being spoken,
they to Weapons go,
Samuel gave him a token,
with a dreadful blow:
And withal incolsed,
with his Enemy,
Then Barnwell he supposed,
that himself should dye.
Then says loving Samuel,
are you now content?
I says Captain Barnwell,
and withal consent,
That my Sister Sara
shall be made thy wife;
So thou will but spare me
and not take my life.
Thus in place they ceased
for the present time,
Sara much was eased
of her troubled mind:
And enjoyed her Samuel,
to her hearts content,
And her Brother Barnwel,
gave his free consent.
Now these Lovers twain
live in joy and peace,
Pray heaven upon them rain
plenty and increase:
And to all true Lovers,
wheresoe'r they be,
Aid them with the favor,
that have such Constancy.
FINIS.
