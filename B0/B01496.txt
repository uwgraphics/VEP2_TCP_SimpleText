AETERNITATI SACRUM.
(...) MONVMENT Er^^^^^ (...) ^^^^^ated to the ^^mory of t^^^ GREAT MINISTER of
State, and fa^ou^ MASTER of the ORDINANCE for b^^^^^ing, Church ^^^^^^s BLEW
DICK of Thanet.
He Is dead and gone* Now wh^^^ or whither*
Would any know, let them come hither.
It Is he, whose (...) for K^^^^ crew*
Got him the (...)
Who, like a (...) Jugler took
Religion (...) for a cloak*
Who did the Serpents chase a^^^
But would not (...)
Who dealt (^^^ugh not with Whore^ and Bawds)
Not Peter;s mo^e, in pious France
Who wore Sheeps-cloathing
But lodged a Ravening Wo^^
Who other, goods did often invade*
But never restitution made
Who, like a Presbyterian (...)
^
Who (...) Gnats was won^ to (...)
But swallowed Camels without (...)
Who from a Ceremony ^led
and yet Rebellion followed.
Who Princes (...) decry'd*
Yet Cromwels High-Court justified.
Who, whilst he Organs overthrew*
The Trumpet of Sedition blew
Who Self-denial Preached; but then
The practice left for other men
Who hated Peace, but courted Strife*
And would not s;wear, but lie for life
Who was against all Forms, unless
It were a Form of Godliness
Who did Idolatry detes;t,
But Sacrilege could well digest.
Who Saints from Windows tumbled, and
Yet let his Dad, the Devil stand.
(...), 'cause Salt-waters best to scour*
To clean the Church, be-piss'd the flo^^
(...), that he might convert the Jew
The Ch^istians* Badge, the Cross o'rthrew*
Who therefore threw the Myte^ down,
that he might after cast the Crown:
And such Triumphant-Saints as he
Chant out their Hey then (...) go we.
Who, like as all weak Brethren did,
Took (right or wrong) the stronges;t side
And was resolved, what ever was Trump;
To follow suit, though 'twere the Rump*
Whos^ worth or wit, no times would own,
Till Dunces had put Doctors down.
Who was betimes a Knave-in-grain,
And Elder-grown* might pas for twain.
Who lived not loved, and when dead,
Was neither missed, nor pitied.
But is he gone! Then wither, pray?
To Heaven or Hell? What shall we say?
If merit here take place, his face
Not more like Judas, then his case.
And if his Work and Wages sure;
That Heaven's not his, is past dispute.
Then Hell must be. But, Reader, stay,
Is he not gone another way?
He needed purging (sure enough)
So full the wretch of vitions stuff:
We'll then for once admit the story,
And think him gone to Purgatory.
Where let him stay, nor thence get free,
Till Heaven shall want such Saints as he.
Mean time, how smiles the Earth! as pleased
Of such a burden to be eased.
Whilst Kent, ashamed to own the Lout,
Is glad the Fiery metcor's out.
Whose Famous Church the Brute so banged,
She Is ve^t at heart he was not hanged.
And that of all the Graceless pack,
An act of Grace should save his neck.
Vowing henceforth (at once the Picts)
To guard Sarre-Wall against ^lew Dicks:
(As Goths and Vandals were to Rome)
The Scourge of Kent and Christendom.
But Charity bids Passion cease,
Then, gentle Reader, go (...) Peace.
Dignum laud virum Musa vetat Mori

Vivit post Funera Virtus.
