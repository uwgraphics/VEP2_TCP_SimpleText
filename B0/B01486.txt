MEMORIAL To be Dispersed through the KINGDOM, For Collecting of MANUSCRIPTS IN
TO THE Advocates Library.
ALL Polite Nations, at this Time, acting in a manner by Concert, in the Design
of Rescuing their Antiquities from Oblivion; and in Collecting and Digesting
into Catalogues such Manuscripts and Ancient Monuments, as may conduce to clear
their Origin, and establish the Truth of their Histories.

In like manner, the Faculty of Advocates, for that, and other Ends, have
Erected their Library, which, in a short time, is very much Advanced; and of
late, has had a considerable Addition of Manuscripts.

But there being many Manuscripts and Monuments of Antiquity, in the Hands of
several Persons, or in the Charter Chests of Ancient Families, which, if still
keep't Latent, will be Useless to the Public, and exposed to many Accidents,
that are prevented by their lying in a public Library. Therefore it is
earnestly desired, That the Havers of any such, whether Histories, Chartularies
of Monasteries, Old Charters, or other Manuscripts whatsoever, would be pleased
to send them in to the Advocates Library; where such Benefactors, and their
Donatives, shall be Faithfully Recorded, and Honorable Mention also made of
Them, in public Catalogues, to be Printed by the Faculty.

All other Persons likewise, who are Possessors of, and who design to Sell, any
such Manuscripts, are also Invited to bring them in; And the Curators of the
said Library will Pay them therefore, to their Satisfaction.
