JOANS Victory Over her Fellow Servants.
A Young Man that with many Maids does dwell,
Thought Joan the rest in beauty did excel;
Mall Was too coy, Jenny was too bold,
Kate was too stale, and Nanny was a scold:
That he dislikes them all, and would with none
Be pleased, but with his fair and dearest Joan,
Tune of, My own sweet Nichol a Cod.




I Have liv'o in this Town these 5 Years,
but never the Lass could find
That would prove so true a Lover,
as constant and as kind:
Now fortune has me befriended,
at last to give me one;
Whose true love I discover,
then here is a good heal Health to Joan.
I once loved Kate and Jenny,
and once I loved Mall;
And then my love turned to Nancy,
but now I dislike them all:
For I have gotten a true love,
whom I affect alone;
It Is she best pleases my fancy,
then here is a good health to Joan,
With Cate I Would a short encounter,
because she was plaguey old,
Her Letchery was so hasty,
that my love soon grew cold:
She proffered me Figgs of the best sort,
but I told her I Would have none,
Cause the strenyth of her breath was so nasty
but here is a good health to Joan,
At length a wonderful kindness,
as possible may be thought,
Did pass betwixt me and Jenny,
bur this was her only fault;
She stradled so wide, and came on so fast.
that she made me cry out, be gone,
For I think the Devil is in you,
then, etc.
But then there was a secret Court there,
betwixt our Mall and I;
And she of her love was so tender,
that I hated her Modesty:
She was so much given to frowning,
and killing glances prone;
That on no terms she would surrender,
then here is a good health to Joan.
At last I had a warm passion
for Nanny my dear heart;
But when ever her I courted,
she was too brisk and smart:
She Would gotten a Tongue with a tang in it,
and a trick to her self alone;
That she kicked like a Colt when we sported
then, etc.
Then since i have gotten a sweetheart,
that is both loving and true;
All old Fish i will defy,
and learn to deal with new:
For I hate to embrace a Carcass
that is nothing but skin and bone;
And has never a whit of beauty,
then, etc.
Since Jenny then was so forward,
and impudent withal;
I thought it fit to leave her,
and my kindness to recall:
For I hate such buxome Lasses,
they will Cuckold me ten to one;
'Twas policy then to deceive her,
then, etc.
Nor will I fix my heart on
those Maids that are too coy;
For Moll she was so squemish,
that she my love did cloy:
Then give me the Lass that is loving,
and not so scrupulous grown;
For that is the Lass without blemish,
then, etc.
Nor i will have no more of this scolding,
which will but end my days;
She is worse then a smoaky Kitchen,
which always plagues your eyes.
Her tongues the worst part about her,
for it is always prone
To chatting, and damming, and itching,
then, etc.
Now 'twould be a thing that is needless;
to tell how I dearly love
She that my heart has wounded,
and does my passion move:
She has none of those damnable errors
to which most Maids are prone:
On her virtues my love is grounded,
then, etc.
She Is neither old nor moldy,
she is neither coy nor bold,
Nor has she faults of Nancy,
she is neither Shrow nor Scold:
Then she is the Maid that i will marry,
she has none of these faults of her own,
Therefore she best pleases my fancy,
then here is a good health to Joan.
FINIS.
