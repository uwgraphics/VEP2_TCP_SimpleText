are harbored, and entertained by their Parents, Masters, and Friends: The
danger and preparative whereof may produce fearful effects, if the same be
not timeously remeided, and such Fugitives and Run-awayes examplarly punished
to the terror of others, in respect whereof; It is hereby statute, enacted,
and ordained, That the Committie of war within each Presbytery and division
in this whole Kingdom, with the concourse of the Shyreffes, Stewarts, and
Bailyies of Regalities, and of the Gentlemen, Ministers, Elders, and
Constables in each Paroshin, who shall be oblidged to concur and assist
herein-till; Shall foorth-with upon sight hereof, cause make present and exact
search and trial for all Fugitives and Run-awayes within their bounds and

these on whom the lot falls, to die according to the proportion foresaid,
shall be put to execution, and die the death, as is above prescribed without
favor. And as for all the rest, who shall hapen to escape by lot, Ordaines
them to be all sent here to Edinburgh bound as Fugitives to be disposed upon,
at the pleasure of the said Committie of Estates, their intertainment, after
they shall be apprehended, and the charges in sending of them here, to be

shall accordingly appear here with all expedition, that such persons as shall
so appear here, and submit themselves in manner foresaids, their lives shall
be saved, and such course taken with them, as the said Committie of Estates
shall think expedient. And sike-like, this present Act anent the said
Fugitives to have full force and execution against all Fugitives and
Run-awayes, who shall hereafter disband and flee in time coming from any
Company or Regiment hereafter to be leavyed in any part of this Kingdom by
warrant from the Estates or Committie thereof. And in like manner, the said
Committie of Estates considering that the Country is abused and burdened with
a number of idle and masterlesse men, and vagabounds, having no settled
calling, vocation, nor employment, who may prove noisome to the Country, if
they be not repressed. Therefore it is statute and ordained, that where ever
any idle or masterlesse men can be found, not having a lawful calling, and
constant residence, and wanting a lawful testimonial of the Minister and
Elders of the Parosh, or some Gentleman of note and respect, or Magistrates of
Burrows where he dwells, that they shall be taken, apprehended, and put in
the nearest prison, and shall remain therein, till they be disposed upon at
the will of the said Committies of war, where they are taken for the service
of the public. And further, it is statute and ordained, that no person
whatsoever, shall presume to travel from his own bounds, without a lawful
testimonial in manner foresaid. And if any man or woman shall be found
traveling from their own bounds, wanting a testimonial (except they be
persons of respect and quality, not ourly known in these bounds where they
shall travel) It is hereby statute, that they shall be imprisoned at the
nearest Jayle or Firmance for the space of eight days, and thereafter shall
be carried from Parosh to Parosh by Constables, or others who shall be
appointed for that effect, till they be brought to their own residence, where
they shall be examplarly punished for their contempt of this statute: Requiring
hereby all the Committies of war, Shyreffes, Magistrates, and others to whom
the execution of these above-written statutes is incumbent: And to whose
knowledge the same shall come, as they will be answereable upon their highest
pain, that they, and every one of them exactly prosecute and execute the same
statutes: And for better effectuating hereof, that they appoint qualified
persons in each paroshin, for bringing in, taking and apprehending the said
Run-awayes, idle and masterlesse men, Anent the which whole premises, these
presents shall be unto them, and every one of them a sufficient warrant.
