To the Tune of, When the Stormy Winds do blow.
By J.P.




YOu Gentle men of England
That lives at home at ease,
Full little do you think upon
The dangers of the Seas;
Give ear unto the Mariners,
And they will plainly show,
The cares and the fears,
When the stormy winds do blow.
All you that will be Seamen,
Must bear a valiant heart,
For when you come upon the Seas
You must not think to start;
Nor once to be faint hearted
In Hail, Rain nor Snow;
Nor to shriek, nor to shrink,
When the stormy winds do blow,
The bitter storms and Tempests
Poor Seamen must endure,
Both day and night, with many a fright
We seldom rest secure:
Our sleep it is disturbed,
With visions strange to know,
And with dreams on the streams,
When the stormy winds do blow.
In Claps of roaring thunder,
Which darkness does enforce,
We often find our ships to stray
Beyond our wonted course,
Which causes great distractions,
And sincks our hearts full low;
It Is in vain to complain
When the stormy winds do blow.
Sometimes in Neptunes bosom,
Our ships is tossed with waves;
And every man expecting
The Sea to be their Graves.
Then up aloft she mounteth,
And down again so low:
It Is with Waves, O with Waves!
When the stormy winds do blow.
Then down we fall to prayers,
With all our might and thought
When refuge all does fail us,
It Is that must bear us out:
To God we call for succor,
For he it is we know
That must aid us, and save us
When stormy winds do blow.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.


THe Lawyer and the Usurer,
That sits in Gowns of Firr,
In Closets warm, can take no harm,
Abroad they need not stir,
When winter fierce with cold does pierce
And beats with Hail and Snow,
We are sure to endure,
When the stormy winds do blow.
We bring home costly Merchandise
And Jewels of great price,
To serve our English Gallantrie,
With many a rare device,
To please the Noble Gentry
Our pains we freely show,
For we toil, and we moyle,
When the stormy winds do blow.
We sometimes sail to the Indies,
to fetch home Spices rare:
Sometimes again, to France and Spain
For wines beyond compare,
Whilst Gallants are carousing
In Taverns on a row;
Then we sweep over the deep,
When the stormy winds do blow.
When Tempests are blown over
And greatest fears are past;
In weather fair, and temperate air
We straight lie down to rest;
But when the Billows tumble,
And waves do furious grow:
Then we rowse, up we rowse,
When the stormy winds do blow.
If Enemies oppose us,
When England is at Wars
With any foreign Nations
We fear not wounds and Scars:
Our roaring Guns shall teach them
Our valor for to know,
Whilst they reele, in the Keele,
When the stormy winds do blow.
We are no Cowardly shrinkers,
But Englishmen true bred
We Will play our parts, like valiant hearts
And never fly for dread:
We Will ply our business nimbly
When ere we come or go,
With our mates, to the straits,
When the stormy winds do blow.
Then Courage all brave Mariners,
And never be dismayed,
Whilst we have bold Adventurers
We never shall want a trade:
Our Merchants will employ us,
To fetch them wealth I know:
Then to be bold, work for Gold,
When the stormy winds do blow,
When we return in safety,
With wages for our pains:
The Tapster and the Vintener
Will help to share our gains:
We Will call for liquor roundly,
And pay before we go;
Then we will rore, on the shore,
When the stormy winds do blow.
FINIS.
