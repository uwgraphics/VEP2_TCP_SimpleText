The brave English Iipsie.
To the tune of the Spanish Ipsie.


COme follow, follow all,
It Is English Iipsies call;
All you that love your lives,
Here Is those for profit strives.
We fare well when thousands lack,
None of us can credits crack.
We fare well, etc.
If we to Gallants come,
The country people run
To see what we can do,
Much pains they undergo:
Seriously a number strives
To lead the English Iipsies lives.
Seriously a number, etc.
We humor none that lives,
Nor hate no man that gives,
Ambition does not rest
In The English Iipsies breast:
If they give, we will willing take,
Naught that is good will we forsake.
We use all things are quaint,
With Painters we can paint;
Our dye is not in vain,
For we do dye in grain:
The Walnut tree supplies our lack,
what was made fair, we can make black.
We take a formal course,
Some six upon a Horse
We single scorn to ride,
Our horse does want no guide:
We by turns will take our ease,
And live all humors for to please.
We scorn for to entise
With beauty Gallants eyes,
We bear no beauteous face,
Our subtle slightes to grace,
We can paint when we command,
And look like Indians that are ^and.
We practice not to dance,
Nor learn no tunes from France,
Our Knackers make no noise,
We are no roaring Boys;
English Iipsies all live free,
And love, and live most iouially.
Our fare is of the best,
Three times a week we feast,
Nay sometime every day,
And yet for nothing pay:
For, Beef or Bacon, Geese or Hens,
What we eat is other men's.
Sometimes where great men dwell,
We do there Fortunes tell,
Our pains for to requite,
We diet there all night:
In this life we spend our days,
English Iipsies Laws obayes.
The second Part.
To the same tune.


WE fear to wrong the Law,
We live in servile awe,
Yet wheresoere we go,
We seldom find a foe:
Wheresoere we come, we find
For one that hates, an hundred kind,
Pleasure we have store,
Who can desire more,
All does our pains requite,
Then frolike we all night,
Among our selves we dance and sing,
Night content to us does bring.
What'ere we get all day,
That night does fly away,
We hoord not up our store,
For next day we have more,
Feast our selves with gallant Cheer,
Spare no cost for wine or beer.
To drink, be drunk, and tipsie,
Delights the English Iipsie:
we live to love all those
That are no Iipsies foes:
Some decayed among Gallants, strives
To lead the English Iipsies lives.
We bear this honest mind,
To love all friends are kind
Our foes we can requite,
with hatred and despite:
For we can plague our mortal foe,
Yet he the actors never know.
Great store of Coin we gain,
Yet for it take no pain:
Our diet's seldom sought,
For it is to us brought,
Pigs or Geese, or Brawne or Sowse,
Or any meat that is in the house.
There Is many stand in fear,
when we approach but near,
Sometimes our very sight
The children does affright:
Our names are spread both far and near,
Our friends we love, but dread no fear,
We hate all surly slaves,
Nor love on cunning knaves,
Our selves can cunning use,
Yet none we will abuse:
He that freely gives, shall find
The English Iipsies always kind,
Who ere has bin in Spain,
And seen there Iipsies vain,
Shall soon the difference find,
Else judgment makes him blind:
So Spanish Iipsies all adue,
For English equal are to you.
So Spanish Iipsies, etc.
FINIS.

Smithfield
