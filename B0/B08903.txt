A Declaration to the Subjects of ENGLAND and WALES.
FOrasmuch as it appears, that in all places, in pulpits, discourses, and
otherwise, the friends to the Popish party have and do daily endeavor to stir
up a most ungrateful and unworthy disrespect unto the Parliament, there are
therefore these considerations presenting themselves to every man's view, and
for the most part evident in the Parliaments own Remonstrances and Declarations.

1 That men would consider, when it pleased God after many Petitions of the
people, to grant this Parliament, what were the complaints of the whole
Kingdom in matters both of Church and State, and the miserable oppressions of
men's consciences and properties.

2 Consider what the Parliament has done with great difficulties to
accommodate the desires of the people in this behalf, in suppressing the power
of tyrants over men's consciences, in taking away all scandalous and
superstitious innovations, in granting libetty to all Parishes to choose
Lecturers, in opening the mouths of godly Ministers, in taking away the
Prelates Courts, how some delinquents have been punished, and others detected,
evil Ministers of Justice are partly removed, Ship Money, Coat and
Conduct-moneys, Patents almost for every thing (to the daily draining and
oppressing of the subject) are all taken away; and consider also whether any
one thing has been done by them, which does not (in tuitu proprio) look at the
future peace and benefit of this Kingdom.

3. Consider, whether if this present Parliament should unhappily be
discountenanced, discouraged, or dissolved (which God forbid) we should ever
hrve the like, or any: or if by virtue of the act for the trienniall Parliament
there should be another, whether any man bearing good will to the
Commonwealth, being chosen, would be encouraged thereunto, and so either we
should have none at all, or if any, such an one which instead of a remedy
should be an inlet of all misery into the (...)

4 Consider how Kingdoms abroad in the world are governed without Parliaments,
where Voluntas Regis is lex populi, the pleasure of the King is the rule of the
Kingdom, and the precipitancie of this Kingdom also before this Parliament,
into all oppression and misery through the deceitful suggestions and
insinuations of wicked Counsel about his Majesty; and whether we are not
looked upon, as the envy of other kingdoms by virtue of this only
inheritance of ours.

5 Consider into what misery, blood and distraction, we had plunged our selves
two years since, (the two nations of England and Scotland imbruing themselves,
and weltring in one another blood) had not the wisdom of the Parliament then
present (consisting for the most part of the same Members as this does) denied
the levying of moneys for the maintaining of that war: which should ever make
us thankful, and mindful of a Parliaments benefit.

6 Consider that whereas the Protestant Profession and the Subjects liberty is
pretended in all things, what good intent either can or could there be to the
one, or to the other, either in those former differences between us and our
brethren, the Scots, or the present divisions in this kingdom, when Papists
and popish persons were then the chief Commanders (for the most part) in the
English Armies, and now Papists, popish persons and Atheists, whose continual
assertions are wounds and blood, and God damn me, or heavens damn me, if we
be not revenged upon these Roundheads (a nickname questionless originally
sprung up from some block-head, having neither wit nor reason in it) these are
the main abettors, provokers, projectors and actors in these division, whether
these aim at the Protestant Religion, whatever they call the Protestant
profession, except it be popery in all things, supremacy only excepted, and the
subjects liberty, let the meanest capacity judge.

7 Consider what tampering there has been these two or three years to raise up
civil wars amongst us in the three Kingdoms: First between us and the Scots,
next in Ireland, and whether the same spirit that works so hot in Ireland,
had no factors in Scotland, and amongst us in England, let all them that have
the right faculty of discerning judge, and whether they that endeavor to raise
up civil wars in a kingdom, can aim at the good of that kingdom, let every
man than has not lost the use of reason determine.

8 Consider what unheard of misery, barbarous cruelty, savage inhumanity is
exercised upon the poor Protestants in Ireland, by that bloody popish party,
let those judge and consider, who either have or will read the Irish
Remonstrance, and observe how these distractions at home (occasioned by the
unhappy division and distance of His Majesty from his Parliament) encourage the
rebels, and hinder the Protestant Cause there, whereas a happy concurrence
between the King and Parliament might in an ordinary way, through Gods
blessing, have subdued those wicked rebels long since.

9 Confider what reproach, scandal and scorn we shall bring upon our whole
nation and posterity for ever, if we should choose a Parliament and because they
will not suffer us to be made slaves, even for their faithfulness and love unto
us, (when happily their own particular safety, and personal preferment might
be better advantaged if they should desert us) for this we should rise against
them, and contend for an Iron yoke, of perpetual bondage and misery, and
whether God may not in displeasure give us up hereunto, who shall so lightly
esteem, and so foolishly improve that opportunity, which he has put into our
hands, and if our posterity will not curse the time that it entered into our
heart so to do.

10. Consider how it can stand with our protestation, to take up Arms against
the whole Body of the Kingdom, represented in the Parliament and the Laws of
the Land, which we are all bound by oath to stand to to the utmost of our
lives, liberties, and estates, and wherein the honor and preservation both of
King and Kingdom does consist, and which of those do break their oath, either
those that pretending the Kings prerogative take up Arms against the whole
Kingdom represented in the Parliament: or those that shall endeavor to
suppress such a malignant party. The King himself having always protested,
that for his part, (taking God to witness) he desires nothing more then the
peace and prosperity of Religion and Kingdom.

11. Consider whereas Laws and Statutes are pretended, as if the Parliament
should do many things illegally, even against the King, with this suggestion,
that then its high time for the Subjects to look to their properties and
liberties, whether are to be believed what is law: either that party that shall
affirm this or that to be law, and will nor appear to maintain their
assertious (the King professing himself to be no Lawyer, many of his
affirmations being the misinformations of others) or the makers of new, and
interpreters of the old Laws, who have all the Judges and chiefest Lawyers in
the Land to advise withal, taking this with us, that Salus populi est suprema
lex? and whether both the Law of the Land and the good of the subject was not
pretended in all the Patents granted, as appears in the several Proclamations
for the same purpose, yea, and in the high Commission and Star Chamber Courts,
and if it were so, let the whole kingdom judge.

12 Consider whether all the wholesome Laws, benefits and liberties of the
subject this day have not been the birth and fruits of Parliaments, and whether
the Parliament has not always been the Sanctuary and refuge for all that have
been unjustly oppressed and abused, and what remedy could be had by any other
appeals whatsoever, when through the corruption of evil Ministers of Justice,
the strength of a man's purse, rather then the righteousness of his cause, has
always been the bonum omen, the certain promising token of good success:
consider therefore whether (by deserting the Parliament) we do not go about to
stop, yea to dry up all the springs of our legal Privileges, having had such
long and happy experiences of the benefits thereof, and whether it ever entered
into the hearts of any of our Predecessors, excepting the Papists, to do the
least injury to Parliaments.

Whereas it is objected against the Parliament, that (under pretense of the
danger of foreign and domestic enemies) they take up arms against the King,
endeavor to destroy the laws of the land, and religion amongst us: consider
whether that these, and greater then these aspersions were not cast upon the
Scots, and no man durst affirm the contrary: and yet when things came legally
to be debated, all proved otherwise, and his Majesty himself did acknowledge
the contrary,; And consider whether it is not now to be doubted, that the same
fire brands of combustion amongst us now, be not those that were formerly
between us and our neighbor Nation, and whether they be not the same Designs
of confusion of both Nations still, altering the Method; beginning in England
now, with hopes to end in Scotland, whereas they formerly begun there, with
purposes to end here.

Lastly, consider whether there be not a threefold ground of the proceedings
against the Parliament, according to the threefold condition of ^he chief
actors in these divisions. viz.

1. The Papists perceive, that the Parliament making progress according to
their beginnings, will take away their hopes of enjoying their Antichristian
Religion amongst us, therefore it stands upon them now to adventure upon any
design, for now or never mbst the Pope up, or down in this Kingdom, and
indeed if men could conceive it, the quarrel is, whether Michael or the Dragon,
Christ or the Pope should get safest footing in this Kingdom; Let any seeing
man look back, and compare the time past, with time present, and let him give
his judgment in this point, whether Popery has not been the mark they aimed
at.

2. For the depending Gentlemen, these also know, that if the Parliamenent
proceed, they shall not only be exposed to the Justice of their former
demerits, but also loose the hopes of any future favor or practice, being
conscious to themselves of ever becoming honest men, who from the beginning of
their preferment have cashiered out of their hearts the fear of God, a good
Conscience, and the day of Judgment, therefore they must either run beyond the
Seas, or bend their endeavors to root up this Prrliament.

3. The Cavaliers, whose Lands estates are above in the Air, who make great
Brags of their desperate attempts, when their greatest danger of drowning has
been in an Ale-Tub, yet they know that it is best fishing in troubled waters,
and that England is full of rich Booties, and therefore they cannot forbear
their prey till opportunity serves their turn, who are are all for the present,
as for the other world, they have passed the dreadful sentence of (God damn
me) these three sorts are the leaders and provokers of a party against the
Parliament.

As for those noblemen whose absence from the Parliament is an encouragement to
this Malignant party, if they come under the ranks of Popish and Dependant,
their practices is a pregnant testimony of what has been said of those two
sorts, namely that their Design is to root up the Parliament, least the
Parliament should root out them, but if they be not under these ranks, either
their ingenuity is to labor to make a a pacification, and to make up thh
breach between his Majesty and the Parliament, or else their Nobility is mero
titulo, little Noble Blood runs in their veins, and Heathens may throw
stones at them, whose progenitors have been rendered famous, by their Heroicke
Acts for their Countries care.

From all these Considerations, this may be well inferred, being necessary for
our present observation.

That if ever we would improve our selves, for God, the King, the Kingdom,
lives, laws and liberties, our selves and poor Posterity, if we would not
see our yet flourishing Cities made ruinous heaps, our peace and plenty turned
into blood and Famine, our dearest Wives ravished before our faces, our tender
Childrens brains dash't against the stones, our mutual trading turned into
violence and robbery, our sweet enjoyments of all relations, unto murders,
rapes, cruelties upon them ^ll, If we have any love to the Gospel of Life,
that the A^ke of God may not depart, and misery come upon us, Let every man in
his station study peace; and endeavor all means of pacification, abhorring
the very thoughts of ever taking up Arms against either King or Parliament, but
to the utmost of our powers, setting our selves against the Incendiaries
between them both, that the Peace of God, and the God of Peace may still rule
in the midst of us, that we render not our selves the mocking stock of
Nations, by doing that our selves, which the politic malice neither of our
Foreign nor Domesticke Enemies in all these fourscore years could effect,
whereby we shall revive the power of our former oppressors, and our ruin shall
be unto after ages, the everlasting shameful monuments of our blindness and
folly, that we should rise up like unnatural Children, and cut the throat of
our own Mother Nation; That we should love bondage rather then liberty, all
Nations Countries and People will sport at our misery, if we shall thus betray
our selves, then shall our reeling and tottering K^ngdome fall, and none shall
lend a hand to support it, It now pants for breath, travailing with the peace,
plenty, security, Religion, Laws, Liberties and comforts thereof, and
therefore let every man that desires a blessing on the King and Kingdom, pray
for the peace of Jerusalem.

FINIS.
