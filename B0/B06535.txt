The VVestminister Frolic: Or, The Cuckold of his own procuring.
Being a true Relation of a Vintener, who for a considerable quantity of
Guianies undertook to persuade his Servant Maid to prostitute her self to a
young Spark, pretending to her that it was no other but himself; whreupon she
seemingly complying, discovered it to her Mistress, who supplying her place,
grafted her Husbands Head.

Thus may we see how scurvy ill-Star'd fate
Does cross some men, nay how they do create
Their own misfortunes, yet for to be bold
The Vintener got his Horns well tipped with Gold.
Tune of, Hey boys up go we.




A Frolic strange I Will to you tell,
the like you never did hear:
A Vintener at Westminster
(as it will plain appear)
A handsome servant Maid did keep,
Which makes him now to rue
For by mistake his head was Horned
this story it is true.
This beauteous maid inflamed a Spark
both comely, rich, and gay,
Who her in vain solicited
with him to go astray,
And offered her great store of Gold
but all that would not do,
She would not yield to Lawless Love:
this story it is true.
Which he perceiving, was the more
desirous of his will,
And many ways he cast about
his purpose to fulfill:
At length he thought her Master might
oblige her to come to
Tho by it he did Horn his head:
this story it is true.
To him he then revealed his mind
with promises of Wealth;
If that he could his Maid persuade
to yield him love by stealth.
After some pause and Gold in hand
he undertook to do
The thing that after Horned his pate.
the story it is true.






Then kindly to his Maid he spoke,
and often on her smiled,
That she the better by such means
might quickly be beguiled;
Watching his time he untertakes
then for himself to woo,
By which design he Horned his pate:
this story it is true.
At first she mighty strange did seem,
as coy as coy could be;
But after many tempting words
she seemed to agree:
But what he did it was resolved
in darkness he should do;
And there alas he Horned was:
the story it is true
For whilst he to the Gallant went
to tell him how he sped,
The Crafty Lass her Mistress told
What proffers he had made;
Who highly did commend her for 't,
and undertook to do
The thing which hornd her husbands head
the story it is true.
The Room appointed private was,
and made exceeding dark,
When at the hour appointed came
the over-joyful Spark
His long-wisht joys for to possess,
and pleasure to pursue;
But by mistake the Vintener Horned;
the story it is true
For why? The Mistress was conveyed
upon the bed there place'd
And feigned the Virgins voice so well,
that kindly he embraced
His supposed lovely Charmer fast,
and sport did often renew,
He bravely Horned the Vinteners head,
the story it is true.
Whilst in one corner of the Room
the Virgin she did stand
And heard what past, the Vintener eke
was ready there at hand
To keep the door but little thought
what after he did rue;
Which was the Horning of his pate:
the story it is true.
For why? with often embraces tired,
at last they taking rest,
The Lady who had sported long
her self in words expressed:
I plainly see, said she aloud,
you if you list can do
The feats of love, thought not with me:
the story it is true.
I find you can* ungrateful man,
see how you are deceived:
You thought your Maid was in your arms
when you so closely cleav'd,
But you are mistaken it is plain;
at this the Gallant knew
That he the Vintener Horned had:
the story it is true.
When between pleased and vexd he called
him straitway in to see
How he had finely fooled himself
in such a high degree;
At which Horn-mad he cursed and swore
and much distracted grew,
Because he by mistake was horned
the story it is true.
But seeing that his Horns were tipped
he rested satisfied,
And pocketed them instantly
his infamy to hide:
And vowed he would never more procure,
what ever he did do,
Since by his own procurement Horns
upon is Forehead grew.
