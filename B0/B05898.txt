THE LYING SPIRIT In the Mouth of the False Prophet Made manifest, Who seeks to
pervert the right way of the LORD, and opens his mouth against the Lord of
Life, and denies his Light within, as appears in a Book, Entitled, The
Doctrine of the Light within, the Natural Man, leading to eternal life,
examined by Scripture Light: Set forth by H. H. which is owned by HENOCH
HOVVEY, called a BAPTIST in Lincoln, for whom it is printed, and by him
dispersed abroad.

Some things therein being here answered in the Light of the LORD.

With the Spirits Testimony to the true Light which every man that comes into
the world is enlightened withal, leading to eternal life, which has unity
with that Light and Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures.

Declared in the movings of the Lord for the Truths sake, and that all deceit
might be made manifest.

Now will I arise says the Lord; now will I be exalted in the earth: Who shall
set Briars and Thorns before the Lord in Battle.

By one who is a lover of all those who love truth in the inward part. W. S.

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1658.

The Lying spirit in the mouth of the false Prophet made manifest etc.
IN the beginning was all things created very good, in the wisdom of God, and
he took pleasure in the works of his hands, and man was made Lord over them
all, standing in communion with the life in God; he had authority to govern the
Creation in the wisdom of God, until the subtlety of the Serpent overcame
him, and prevailed over him, to turn his mind from the wisdom and life of God,
into the earth, to feed upon that which the Lord had forbidden, where he entered
into the transgression, and fell from the wisdom and life from which he
received power and authority to govern and rule, and so the curse came over
him, having lost his innocence, being subject to the Serpents subtilty, which
he yielded himself unto, to be guided by, and so was driven out from his place
of excellency into the earth, to eat his bread in sorrow all the days of his
life. He that can read this, let him; For that subtle Serpent which led into
the transgression, leads still in the transgression all that yield themselves
to his enticements, and are taken Captives by him at his will, and so are led
by him to oppose that in which Gods love is made manifest, to break his head,
and to recover out of his snares: This being the great design of that roaring
Lion, to keep people in that which he has led them into, and from that, which
is to recover them from under his dominion; and this is that which was, and is
an enemy to the righteous seed of God in all its appearances, through ages and
generations unto this day, as is manifest in this generation of wicked and
ungodly men, who in the envious spirit, sets their faces to do mischief, as
Henoch Howet has done, as his own words do manifest, who says, he having had
much to do with a generation of men that held forth another doctrine of
converting, or another means of convincing of men in their natural condition,
then ever Christ or his Apostles did, and to prove this by Scripture light, as
he calls it, he names 2 Timothy 4.23. but here he is not in the light of the
Scripture, (his own language) for there is not such a verse as he has named;
and so he is here shut up, and let his mouth be for ever stopped in his
ignorance, and blindness, who is charging a generation of men with holding
forth some strange doctrine contrary to Christ and his Apostles, and has no
testimony to what he says; and yet he tells us he is a labourer in a good
Vineyard, and that he knows the enemy now rages more by delusions, then by
open persecutions; these being the days (in which if it were possible) to
deceive the very Elect.

Ans. John saw many deceivers entered into the World in his time, which was
those that Christ Jesus said should come to deceive the very Elect, if it were
possible; and have thou been a professor so many years, and have not seen them
before these days? If thou had not opposed that by which all deceivers are
made manifest, and in which John saw them, thou might have seen them many
years ago, and thy self to be one of them, who speaks a vision of thy own
brain, and not from the mouth of the Lord; and this is the doctrine which is
contrary to Christ and his Apostles, and the enemy which now rages both by
delusions, and open persecution; for the spirit of delusion never ceased from
persecution against all who bear forth a living testimony to the Gospel and the
power of it, but was always an enemy to it, and labored against it, as thou
do, though thy labor be to no purpose.

Then thou say, thou have taken it upon thee as thy duty to forewarn all men
of that doctrine that teaches men to look to the light within them for
directions from their natural condition all along, until they come to that
estate they call their perfection.

Ans. It is manifest from thy own mouth, that thy work was not wrought in God,
nor thy duty in obedience to his movings, but taken upon thee in thy own will,
and performed in thy own wisdom, which is contrary to all that are sent of God,
and labors in his Vineyard, who do not take upon them any thing in their own
wills, and call it their duty, but waits on the Lord, to be obedient to his
movings, to receive from him what is their duty to perform unto him; so the
Lord gives forth his word, and it is declared in righteousness; but that which
thou have taken upon thee at thy own will and pleasure is all denied, not being
received from the mouth of the Lord; for thou who denies the light within, and
art forewarning people for looking to it, thou denies the Scriptures, and the
spirits testimony therein, and thereunto; for David bare forth his testimony in
the spirit of the Lord, That the light of Christ enlightened the world, and in
his light they saw light. John testified that Christ was the true light that
lights every man that comes into the world. Christ said he was the light of
the world; and if this thou will own, which thou say thou art examining by,
then show who they are, and what sort of people that Christ does not enlighten,
and whether he does enlighten people within, or without them, and where is his
light to be looked for, and walked in, and prove thy self a labourer in Gods
Vineyard; for all that were sent of God, and labored for him, exhorted all
people unto the ends of the earth, to look unto Christ and be saved, and to
turn from the darkness to the light; therefore repent and be converted, that
thy sins may be blotted out, thou who art in the Antichristian state.

Then thou say, thou will endeavor to show what the enemy (which thou say
is the light within) draws people to, which is, to take counsel at a corrupt
heart; and says, It is evident, if they look to that which they call the light
within, two things being in communion, a disobedient natural man, they are like
to see nothing but ayrie notions, with spiritual working powers to delude
within them.

Ans. Have thou not made it evident, that the spirit of God lives not in thee,
and that thy body is not the Temple of the Holy Ghost, who knows nothing within
thee to take counsel at, but a corrupt heart? Have thou been so long looked at
to be a teacher of others, and now brought to confess, that man has nothing to
look at within him but a corrupt heart? Have thou then ministered from any
other principle, then from a corrupt heart? For shame give over deceiving
people, and tell them plainly what it is thou takes counsel at, for some have
seen thee, and withdrawn from thee, because a corrupt heart is thy counselor,
which leads thee into all confusion; for thou here talks of a disobedient
natural man, and that he cannot see himself otherwise, if he look to the light
within, and yet thou talks of obedience to Christ's commands and ordinances in
another place; What is thy obedience performed in to Christ's commands and
ordinances, seeing thou say that man is naturally disobedient, and his heart
corrupted, and nothing else to be looked at within him? Then has not the
Prince of the power of the Air dominion over thee who rules in all the
children of disobedience? Consider thy own words, and see if there be any thing
in them besides Airie notions.

Then thou say, But if they will say, they have no communion with the
Devil, or Prince of the Air, then thou say his design must needs be to
bring them to consultation in a heart that is deceitful and desperately wicked;
and being deceitful, it will offer darkness for light, and so unavoidably put
them in danger of being deceived.

Ans. Thou have unvailed thy self to all the children of light, who reads thee,
and sees what thou art consulting with, who denies the light and hates to be
reformed by it, and despisest the counsel of it, though it stand a faithful
witness in thy conscience to reprove thee of all thy ungodly deeds, which in
the darkness is brought forth by thee, from thy wicked and deceitful heart
which thou art consulting with, being alienated from the life in God, thy
foolish heart being blinded by the Prince of darkness, who has dominion over
thee; receive thy own words which thou have laid down, and then consider what
that is which makes the heart manifest, by which thou comes to see the heart to
be corrupted, and the desperate wickedness of it, and the danger of consulting
with it, and what it offers in that state; submit to that of God in thee, and
own plainness of speech, and thou can not deny but it is the light that makes
all things manifest; for whatsoever does make manifest, is light, Ephesians. 5.13. so
the heart being within people, the light which makes it manifest is there also,
and searches the heart through all the corruption and deceit of it; for all
things are naked and bare before it; and this is so plain that all people may
know that there is that in them which stands a witness against all the deceit
of their own hearts, and never does consent to sin, but reproves for it in the
conscience of every man, which is the light that Christ Jesus does enlighten
every man withal; therefore be not stiff-necked and rebellious, but turn to
the Lord God of Life and Power, and wait in the light which he has enlightened
thee withal, that thou may come to the knowledge of the glory of God and to
feel his living Power mortifying sin in thee, and creating a clean heart within
thee, before thou talk of obedience to Christ's Commands, and the Apostles
practice; for until thou obey the reproof of the light of Christ within, and
turn at the reproof of it, to be guided by it, thou know not the first
Principle of the pure Religion, though thou have made a profession many years,
nor have not set one foot into the way of Christ, though thou imagine a long
travel in it, and that thou art come to the end of it. So some of thy folly is
here fully answered in few words and plainness, therefore silence flesh, and
contend no longer against that in which the love of God is made manifest to
sinners; and this I am made to testify in the power of the Lord for the seeds
sake; and he that can receive it, let him.

Then thou say, If they would yet excuse themselves, and say they do not take
counsel at their own heart, then thou say it cannot be evaded; but if they
look to the light within for counsel, they must needs look to their own souls.

Ans. If thou were not altogether in darkness, thou might here see thy
confusion, who art endeavoring to forewarn people, and knows not of what,
neither can show distinctly what it is, but say, If it be not a corrupt
heart, then it is a deceived heart; and if not a deceived heart, then it is
their own soul: How blindly art thou led from all light and truth! for if thou
were guided by the light of Christ, thou might have showed in what a corrupt
heart, and a deceitful heart differs, (if any difference be) and what the soul
is, and in what part of man it is placed; for if thou know not this, then
art thou wholly ignorant of all that which thou have been charging a generation
of men withal; and all thy imaginations is denied, and thy confusion and
standers is returned again unto thee, as dung upon thy face.

Then thou say, To look to the light within, leads men to look at a Judgment
here in this life, and so takes off man's expectati^n from eternal Judgment;
and this (thou say) gives license for lust to rule, and is an invitation for
the world to lie still in wickedness, and for the Epicure to sing a delightful
song to his soul, Soul, take thine ease.

Ans. The Saints witnessed the Lord come near to judgment, and every
transgression and disobedience to receive a just recompense of reward; Does not
the Scripture stand a witness against thee? Did not David witness the
Judgments of the Lord to be true? and Moses witnessed all his ways to be
judgment; and was not this known by them in this life, which brought them to
fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, and to stand in awe, and not to sin?
And does this deny eternal Judgment? or give liberty for lust or wickedness to
rule? Or brings it not those to cease from the evil, whom the righteous
Judgments of God takes hold upon? Therefore woe be unto all the Epicures who
put the Judgment of the Lord afar off, and sit down at ease in the flesh, and
makes their belly their god, minding earthly things, devouring Gods Creation to
satisfy a lustful appetite, and so treasuring up Wrath against the day of
Wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God, who will render to
every man according to his deeds, when the Workers of iniquity will not be
known by him, but must all depart from him into the everlasting fire, there to
abide under the eternal Judgment: Therefore I say unto thee, Repent, and sink
down under the Judgment in this life, that all sin and transgression may be
judged out of thy heart by the light and power of Christ, that eternal
Judgment be not thy portion.

Then thou say, That to look all the light within carries a deceived people
for a self-loving heart, and to an imagination of perfection, and that their
mouths are full of cursing and bitterness, and proud; and that their tongues
proves them perverse.

Ans. And here thou speaks as if thou were not to be controlled, but as if thy
tongue were thy own, and there was no Lord to be over it: But that which thou
slanders the truth with, is denied, (that is to say) That any who are guided by
Christ the Light of the World, do bring forth any of these things which thou
falsely accuses them of, but thou art seen and read in that which is eternal, to
slander the truth with that which has Dominion over thee; yet is the Truth
pure, and all thy dirt cannot stain it, and all who live in it have a sure
defense and a refuge from this stormy tempest which the Devil has raised up,
even to shake the foundation of the righteous; but it is a Rock higher then
all, and above all, which the righteous are set upon, and there stand in
safety; therefore either prove thy words, that such fruits are brought forth by
those who look to the light within, and are guided by it, or else own thy
confusion, and in it thy shame.

Then thou brings thy Reasons why men are carried headlong to these delusions,
and mixeth the Scripture with thy reason, saying, It is evident from the
Apostles Doctrine to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 11.3. evidently showing the cause
to be Satan's transforming himself into an Angel of Light, and says, The word
Transforming imports the carrying of himself through all forms as an angel or
messenger of light.

Ans. The Apostles Words I own, and they shall stand a Witness against thee who
denies the light by which he was guided, and so art gathering his words into
thy Reason, but cannot thereby come into the life; and so thou rests in the
form, (out of the power) where Satan is transforming himself, as from thy own
words, who says he carries himself through all forms, then how can thou
exclude him from thine? Therefore I say unto thee, and all who abide in forms
with thee, Come out from him, for I deny both him and thy forms, that so it is
plain from thy own mouth, that thou rests in that into which Satan can
transform himself, having the likeness, but is not the substance; and these are
his Ministers who are thus transformed by his deceitful working, as Ministers
of Righteousness, though they be false Apostles, deceitful Workers,
transforming themselves as the Apostles of Christ; if thou have an ear open,
thou may hear if these be not they who are laboring to uphold visible
things, as thou have done in thy Book, crying, The Ordinances of Christ, the
practice of the Apostles, these are to be walked in, and so the imitation is
taken up, and the visible thing is practiced, as the Apostles of Christ, but
the light, life, and power of God is denied, in which they enjoyed the
substance, which was sweet to their taste, who felt that the Lord was good; and
this was not a thing visible without them, but enjoyed within them, which was
the Bread of Life, and Water of Life, into which Satan cannot transform
himself; and this I own, and in my measure witness to be ordained of God from
the beginning, who satisfies the hungry with the fatness of his House, and
refreshes the thirsty with the Rivers of his good pleasure; and this thou art
a stranger to, who denies Christ the light of the World, who is the Fountain
where living Mercies are witnessed: And so thou erres, not knowing the
Scripture nor the power of God, though thou have made a long profession of
them, and can speak much of them, as the Pharisees could do, and as the Devil
can do; yet whilst thou denies that by which they were given forth, they are
as Weapons formed against thee.

The second Reason (thou say) is Natures darkness; for (thou say) if the
Ephesians were sometimes darkness, then in that state they had nothing but
darkness [supposed Light] to look unto.

Ans. All who are in the light, sees thy darkness, who knows not Christ from
Natures darkness, and calls him a supposed Light; for Christ was in the
Ephesians in that state of darkness, though by them unregarded, as he is by
thee; Wherefore he says, Awake thou that sleep, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light; by the reproof of the light were they
awakened, and did arise from their dead state of darkness, and were made light
in the Lord. And here was something to be looked unto besides the da^kness,
which reproved them in the darkness, as it does thee and all the World, who
refuse to be guided by it, and rejects Gods visitation; therefore thou art
darkness, and abides in darkness, and know not whither thou go, because
that darkness has blinded thy mind.

Then thou say, Having showed what this delusion is a means to draw people
to, thou will now show what it is a means to draw them from.

And this thy Wisdom lays down in many particulars; saying, First, it keeps us
from seeking a City that has foundations, the Doctrine of the Apostles and
Prophets, and that these people have a Christ they account more spiritual then
the Carpenters Son, and that they will not have that man to reign over them.

Ans. The City is witnessed, into which no unclean thing can enter, but must
abide without amongst the Dogs and Sorcerers; and the Doctrine of the Apostles
and Prophets is owned and enjoyed, and Christ is received who is King of
Saints; but all thy inventions and imaginations is denied, who knows Christ no
otherwise then as the Carpenters Son, and so would have him to reign; if this
be thy Faith, then prove by plain Scripture that Jesus Christ is the Carpenters
Son, or that his Dominion is exercised in that nature, else own delusion to be
upon thee, and thy spirit to be a spirit of error.

Thou have made such a mixture of thy own inventions with the Scriptures, that
it is hard to draw the Wine from the Lees, for thou have altogether set Christ
in opposition to the Light within, which the Saints never did; and yet thou
say, They that look to Christ, and are enlightened, their faces shall not be
ashamed: So here thou have confessed none can be enlightened but such who look to
Christ, and thou have owned Christ to be the light which does enlighten,
therefore now it is laid upon thee, either to confess, or deny in plainness,
Whether Christ does enlighten people within, yea, or nay? if yea, then he is
the light within which people are to look unto, and be saved, which thou art
fore-warning people from as a dangerous delusion. If nay, then it is laid upon
thee to prove by plain Scripture where he is, how he does enlighten, and how
people may come to him, and receive him, and be baptized into him, and put him
on, and be led by him; so the Work will be short, and many Words needs not be
multiplied to manifest truth, for it stands not in word, but in power, though
much thou have laid together in thy Book, as if truth did consist or stand in
many inventions; I am moved of the Lord to tell thee and all people, That the
Lord is risen to overturn all the inventions and imaginations of man, and all
false ways and worships, which are not in spirit and truth, and they shall
fall and come to naught, though never so strongly contended for; but that which
is of God shall stand.

Thy other particulars I shall here lay down, as in thy Wisdom thou have drawn
them forth.

1. Thou said the Light within, draws people from Christ appearing in
conversion. 2. From confirming in assurance, and working of us up to follow on
to know the Lord by several visitations. 3. From the Doctrine of the Apostles
and Prophets. 4. From the blood of the Covenant. 5. From the experience of the
creating Word. 6. From waiting for commands of Gods loving kindness. And then
thou concludes, That watching in the light within to bring us to perfection,
will be a vain watch.
I shall here wait for thy Answer to be published, as to what is laid upon
thee, for I have born my Testimony in the spirit of the Lord, against all that
which thou say the Light within leads people to; so in general I do deny
that it leads any, or draws them from any one of these particulars which thou
have laid down; for I am made to stand a Witness against thee in the power of
the Lord, knowing that Christ Jesus the Light of the World, who lights every
one that comes into the World, does lead all that are guided by him, from all
that which thou say the Light within leads people to, and unto that which
thou say it draws people from, that so thou art calling the light darkness,
and darkness light: And for what thou have said in thy considerations upon
Baxters Papers which thou said was against the Quakers, thou have there
considered nothing but what is carnal and visible, saying your Water is in
Fountains and Rivers visible, and that the natural Tongue of the godly can show
the Way of Life to the natural ear and eye, and so to the understanding of the
natural man; and much more such like as this thou have considered of, which are
all to perish, as all other visible things must; and so thy hope will perish
with them, who knows not a life above them; but those whom thou have set thy
self against, knows their life to be in that which is eternal, and will abide
for ever, and are made to deny all thy visible and carnal things, as rudiments
of the World; and this I have also observed in thy Considerations, Herod and
Pilate made friends.

I am moved of the Lord to tell thee, That whosoever watches in that Light
which thou say will be a vain watch, they shall be defended from the Enemies
Power, for there does the Lord preserve his people, and keep them from the
Heathens rage, though thou have bent thy bow, and shot thy Arrows at the
upright in heart, they shall return again upon thee, for no harm shall come
nigh the dewlling place of the Saints of the most High; for who dwell in the
Light are compassed about with mercies, and there are made to sing songs of
Deliverance; so thou art now to answer to what is laid upon thee, and expected
from thee, that is, To confess, or deny plainly, Whether Christ does enlighten
people within, yea or nay? and to distinguish betwixt Christ and the light
within; for until thou have done that, all thy Work is but confusion; which if
thou refuse, let thy mouth be for ever stopped, as a mouth full of iniquity and
perverseness.

Let all flesh be silent.
The Spirits Testimony to the true Light which every man that comes into the
world is enlightened withal, etc.
THe Lord God of Life and Power has in this his day made manifest to his
Saints that which the World cannot believe, who have eyes, and see not; ears,
and hear not, neither do they understand with their hearts the things that God
has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed them unto his Babes
whom he has gathered out of the World, and has opened their eye to see, and
their ear to hear, and given them a heart to perceive the things that belong to
their peace, which confounds all the wise men of the World, who are searching
into the things of God in their fallen Wisdom, in which they can neither see
nor perceive the mystery of the glorious Gospel of Christ, and therefore they
take counsel together against it, and against the Lord and his anointed,
crying Heresy and Delusion, Deceivers, Antichrists, false Prophets are now
come, beware of them that you be not deceived with them who talk of a Light
within people to guide them by: And this is the cry both of Priests and
Professors at this day; and though they be at enmity in many things, and oppose
one another, yet do they all join together, and take counsel to smite the
upright, and make war with the Lamb; therefore in the movings of the Lord it is
laid upon me to bear forth my Testimony for the Truths sake, that none might
abide in darkness, and be deceived by the Serpents subtilty, but that all might
be turned from the darkness to the light, where pardoning mercy is felt and
witnesnessed, and in love to all in whom the living Witness is raised, that you
may not be soon shaken, nor your desires after the Truth be cooled, nor the
pure be quenched, but that all who are breathing after God, may follow on to
know him; for as the Dayspring from on high does visit you, all Clouds will
vanish away, and you will come to see above them; and so in the light of Christ
waiting, you will come to see things that differ, and discern the precious from
the vile, and so come to know what is of man, and what is of God; therefore
believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God, because
many false Prophets are in the World, who are covered with sheeps clothing;
therefore try them inwardly; the light makes them manifest, and the Wolf is
seen within; therefore try all things in the Light, and hold fast that which is
good; for these are perilous days, men are lovers of themselves, covetous,
proud boasters, cursed speakers, lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God;
who have a show of godliness, but deny the power thereof, from such turn away,
for they resist the truth, and are men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
the faith; but now are they made manifest in the light, and their madness shall
proceed no further; for the day has declared them, and wolves they do appear
to be, their work is tried of what sort it is, and their foundation proves
sandy, and their building hey and stubble: Therefore be not tossed up and down
with every wind of Doctrine, for form without power will not save you; nor can
the Letter without the life give you peace; therefore let no man deceive you
with vain Words, in crying up the Kingdom of God without you, as if it came
with observations, but every one wait to know the Kingdom of God within you;
for Christ preached it there, which every one is to look unto, from whence all
good comes, and the Lords love is freely opened, and his good and perfect gift
is given, a measure to every one, by which they are enlightened and made to
know good from evil; for God so loved the World, that he gave his only
begotten Son who is the light of the World, and lights every man that comes
into the World, that all men through him might believe; and this will be the
condemnation of all that hate it, who are in the evil deeds, and will not come
to the light least their deeds should be reproved; [mark] the evil deeds are
made manifest by the light in the conscience of a natural man, so that he sees
his deeds to be evil; but he hates the reproof of the light, and loves darkness
rather, because his deeds are evil. And this is the Lords tender mercy to all
people, That he has not left himself without a Witness in the conscience of
all the Sons and Daughters of men, which makes manifest their evil deeds, and
testifies against them, and calls them to repentance; so will the Lord be
clear when he judges, who would not the death of him that dies. Therefore all
people consider if such a Witness you have not in your consciences which
testifies against all your ungodliness, and searches you in secret, from
which nothing can be hid; for it makes manifest the motions of sin in you, and
a motion is in the heart, then is it not within you? And is not that within you
at all times, and in all places, which makes the motion of sin manifest, and
reproves you in your consciences when you are in the transgression, either by
thought, word or deed? I am made to speak plainly to manifest truth to the
lowest capacity, that all moderate spirits may consider if that be not within
them which does secretly reprove them for sin and evil, which is Christ Jesus
the Light of the World, which the Serpentine Wisdom calls Natures darkness, and
would draw away peoples minds from it because it does discover his Kingdom, and
his Works are destroyed by it; for this end was the Son of God made manifest,
That he might destroy the Works of the Devil; and herein is Gods love tendered
to all people, who has enlightened all, and by his spirit strives with them in
this day of his patience, that his goodness might lead to repentance, and that
his tender mercy might not be shut up in displeasure; and thus does he wait to
be gracious, and makes manifest his love to sinners, in that he takes them not
away in their sin, and in his sore displeasure, but gives them several
visitations by reprovings and convincements in their own consciences for sin
and disobedience, that they might turn unto him, and feel his love opened as a
Fountain of living mercies: And this I am moved of the Lord to bear my
testimony to, and there is that in all your consciences that answers to the
truth of it, unto which I am made manifest, which is the Witness of God in you
all, and reproves you all who are in your sins, for your iniquities; therefore
I am made to exhort you all in the fear of the Lord God, to turn to the light
which Christ has enlightened you withal, and obey it when it reproves you,
and follow it when it leads you, and goes before you, so shall you not abide in
darkness, but your feet shall be guided into the way of peace, which leads to
eternal life; and though the World and formal professors be crying Heresy and
Delusion, yet whosoever waits in the light, shall feel food ministered to
satisfy the hungry, and strength renewed to follow the Lord without weariness,
and walk in his Way without faintness: And this is the eternal truth of the
Lord God which I am made to bear forth my testimony to, as I know it in the
Lord; and he that can receive it, let him.

And now my dear Friends in the everlasting truth of God, I feel my heart
enlarged toward you, even to stir up your minds to the Lord God, that you may
all keep stayed in the Light in which you are preserved in perfect peace,
though the seas roar, and the Waters thereof swell, and the Waves beat in the
stormy tempest, you are at rest in your desired Haven, there kept by the power
of the lord God; and though many Clouds arise to overspread and darken your
glorious day, so as to make your Sun set in a Cloud, yet in the light of Gods
countenance do you walk as children of the Day, compassed about with his living
mercies; therefore all keep faithful to the Lord God, in whose power you are
all preserved, and watch in the light against your Enemy, for he works as
subtly within as he does without, and labors to draw your minds into earthly
things, but abide you in your Fathers House, where the Bread is sure, and the
Water that fails not; wait to feel the love of God shed abroad in your
hearts, and in that love, love one another, and be tenderhearted one toward
another; let all things be done in the pure Wisdom of God, that he may have the
praise in it; keep your selves unspotted from the World, that your garments may
be kept pure, and no stain may be upon them, having pure righteousness for your
robes; Watch over one another in the meek spirit, and be not rash to judge, but
ready to admonish, that in love and unity all may grow in the measure of God,
and feel his increase. So all feed upon that Bread which comes down from
Heaven, and drink of that Water which is in the living Fountain, that you may
feed upon that which is eternal, whilst the Serpent feeds upon the dust. So in
the light all dwell, that your hearts and minds may be kept clean and pure to
the living God, that he may delight to dwell amongst you, and walk in you, and
have dominion, and reign, whose right it is, and no Weapon formed against you
shall prosper: Therefore in nothing fear your adversaries, which is to them an
evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

The End.
