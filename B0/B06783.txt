THE Young-Mans Lamentation
Containing, His Pastionate Complaint of his Unconstant Lover, Together, with
his Resolution to leave her who scornfully slighted him.

To an Excellent New Tune, or, Over Hills and high Mountains.
Licensed according to Order.







MEe^ing ^s a pleasure,
but parting's a grief,
An Unconstant Lover
i^ worse than a Thief,
A T^ief can but Rob me,
a^^ take what I have,
But an Unconstant Lover
will bring me to the Grave.
When fancy is grounded,
and rooted beside,
The lover is wounded
as soon as denied;
Many Torments are bleeding
to increase his pain,
And the lover lies bleeding
by the darts of disdain.
This is my condition,
I needs must confess,
With humble submission
I have made my address;
In her Charms I delighted
more than Gold I declare,
Yet am scornfully slighted
for the love which I bear.




I value not treasure,
the rich Golden Ore,
There Is joy, love, and pleasure,
which I dearly adore;
But alas! that sweet blessing
I may not enjoy,
I am sorrows possessing,
which my life will destroy.
Like a Ship on the Ocean,
I am tossed too and fro,
From the height of promotion,
to the depth of sad woe,
While the Billows are roaring
in a Tempest of grief,
I the Fates am imploring,
but can find no relief.
Of a false-hearted lover
I needs must complain,
To my grief I discover
that my sighs are in vain;
Having moved her to pity,
with tears in my eyes,
While that sorrowful dity
she would scorn and despise.
To think that my Jewel
should torture me so,
In loves flaming fuel
with a Feavour I glow,
She Is more than ungrateful,
unconstant, unkind
To her dear loyal lover,
like the wavering wind.
In her Cheeks blushing Roses,
with lillies appear,
Where Cupid reposes,
as her Charms I draw near,
I account it my duty
her perfection to prize,
She Is a Phoenix for beauty,
was she constant likewise.
If her heart was not ranging,
she should soon be my Bride,
But alas she is changing
and turns with the Tide,
Having ruined many
by her f^lse-heart alone,
She Is not constant to any,
but can love more than one.
Since I find out her folly,
I Will no longer repine,
But will strive to be jolly
with a Glass of Rich Wine,
No longer about her
will I troubled be,
I can now live without her,
let her go, farewell she.
Though I am forsaken,
yet she is forswo^n,
Yet she is mistaken,
if she think that I Will mourn;
I Will set as (...)ly by her,
as ever she did b^ me,
And for ever will deny her,
let her go, farewell she.
