THE Merry Wooing of Robin and Joan The West-Country Lovers.
To the Tune of, The beginning of the World, Or, Sellingers Round, Or, Great
Boobe.






O Mother thave been a Batchellor
This twelve and twenty years,
And Ize have often been a wooing:
And yet cham never the near:
Joan Gromball cheel ha none of me
Ize look so like a Lowr:
But I vaith cham as proper a Man as she
Zhe needs not be Zo stout.
She Zaies if ize coud dance and sing,
As Thomas Miller con,
Or cut a Cauper, as little Jack Tailor
O how cheed love me then;
But zoft and fair, chil none of that,
I vaith cham not Zo nimble
The Tailors have naught to trouble his thoughts
But his needle and his thimble.
O Zon the art of lawful Age
And a jolly tide Boy
I Would have thee try her one again
She can but say nay:
Then O Gramarcy Mother
Chill Zet a good Vaces of the matter
Chill dress up my Zelf as fine as a Dog,
And chill have a fresh bout at her.
And first chill put on my Zunday Parrel,
That laced about the Quarters;
With a pair of Buckram Slops
And a Vlanting pair of Garters
With my Sword tide vast to my Zide
And my Grandfathers Dugen Dagger
And a Peacocks Veather in my Capp,
Then ah how Ise shall swagger.
Nay take the Loekrum Napkin Son,
To wipe thy snotty nose,
It Is no matter vor that chilli Snort is out
And Vlurt it athwart my Clothes:
Dv's bod kins nay sie away
I prithee Son do not so,
Be mannerly Son till thou can tell
VVeather she will ha thee or no.
But Sirrah Mother hark a while,
VVhos that that comes so near:
It Is Joan Grombal, hold thy peace
For fear that she do hear:
Nay out be she chill dress my words,
In Zuch a Scholards Grace,
But virst of all shall take my Hands,
And lay them athwart her Vace.
Good morrow my Honey my Sugar Candy
My little pretty Mouse,
Cha hopes thy Vather and Mother be well
At home at thine own House
Ich am came Vart to show my mind
Cham Zure, thou know my Arrant:
Zum say Iug that I mun ha thee,
O no good Sir, I warrant.
You must (Sir Clown) is for the King,
And not for such a mome,
You might have said by your leave fair Maid
And let your (must) alone.
Ich am no more a Clown that vlat
Cham in my Zunday Apparel
Ich came vor Love and I pray so take it
The hopes the will not quarrall.
Joan. Robin do thou love me so well,

Robin. I vaith abomination,
Why then you should have framed your wodrs
Into a finer fashion.
Vine Vashions and Vine (...)eeches (...),
As Schollards Volks can Utter,
Chad wrather speak but two words plain
Than half a score and stutter.

Robin. Chave Land, chave House, chave two v(...) Be(...)
That Is better then fine Speeches,

Joan. It Is a sign that Fortune favors Fools,
She let them have such Riches,

Robin. Hark how she comes upon me now,
I do wish it be a good Zine,

Joan. He that will steal any wit from thee
Had need to rise betime.

Ise, Vaith Ise am no vool Ise Zay
Ise think you Zud know better:
Do thou think Ise not know I pray,
Good speech and manners better:
It Is sure you know not if you did
You Would never have been a Lover.
Nay nay, my Dear, nay nay udzlid
Why mun not I discover.
What long in secret i'se ha kept
And would ha longer done it
Had not my Passion been Zo heaped
Ise had no more Room for it.
And are you in Love as you Zay.
Yes Vaith and Troth Ise Zware it
Then prithee Robin set the day
And wees even both be Married.
