VERSES, Lately Written by THOMAS Earl of STRAFORD.
(I.)
GO, Empty Joys,
With all your noise,
And leave me here alone,
In sweet sad silence to bemone
Your vain and fleet delight,
Whose danger none can see aright,
Whilst your false splendour dimmes his sight.
(II.)
Go and ensnare
With your false ware,
Some other easy Wight,
And cheat him with your flattering Light:
Rain on his head a shower
Of Honors, favor, wealth, and power;
Then snatch it from him in an hour.
(III.)
Till his big mind
With gallant wind
Of Insolent applause:
Let him not fear all-curbing Laws,
Nor King nor Peoples frown;
But dream of something like a Crown;
And climing toward it, tumble down.
(IV.)
Let him appear
In his bright Sphere,
Like Scynthia in her pride,
With star-like troops on every side;
Such for their number and their light,
As may at last orewhelme him quite,
And blend us both in one dead night.
(V.)
Welcome sad Night,
Griefs sole delight,
Your mourning best agrees
With Honors funeral Obscquies.
In These lap he lies,
Mantled with soft securities,
Whose too much Sunshine blinds his eyes.
(VI.)
Was he too bold,
That needs would hold
With curbing raines, the day,
And make Sols fiery Steeds obey?
Then sure as rush was I,
Who with ambitious wings did fly
In Charles his Wai^ too loftily.
(VII.)
I fall, I fall,
Whom shall I call?
Alas, can (...) heard,
Who (...) is nither loved nor feared.
You, who were wont to kiss the ^round,
Where e're my honored step (...) found,
Come catch me at my last rebound.
(VIII.)
How each admires
Heavens twinklng fires,
When from their glarous seat
Their influence gives life and heat.
But O! how few there ar',
(Though danger from that act be far)
Will stoop and catch a falling starr.
(IX.)
Now it is to late
To imitate
Those L^htes, whose palliednesse
Argues no (...) guillinesse:
That course (...) is bent.
The (...) is there is no (...)
In Heavens high Court of Parliament.
Printed in the year 1641.
