IN ANATOMICUM THEATRUM LUGD. BATAV.
Advena, qui Batavas spectatum veneris oras,
Huc age, quae stupeas inclyta Leyda dabit,
Huc ubi Legiferam. Cererem comitatur Osiris,
Isidos Argolicae suspice signa Deae;
Frustra Deum fragilis Fortunae idola profana,
Urnam, quae cineres relligiosa notet.
Lampada, ad humanos quae non pervenerit usus,
Cui magis in cultu, cui magis apta Deum!
Vixerit aeternae tantum se pasta lucernae
Flammula, an invisae larva sit illa rei?
Qua lacerarit acu, qualem cui Fibula vestem.
Vinxerit, unde sagum strinxerit, unde togam:
Divitis Aegypti pretiosa cadavera, lata
Finibus Eois, invidiosa Diis:
Singula nosse juvet, tamen his and inania rerum,
Et maris, and terrae viscera posthaebeas;
Erudit in cantum te vox facunda CRAMERI,
Et claram ambiguo praestat ubique facem.
Sic saecli penetrare sinus, and viscera very.
Sic poteris Roma prodigiore frui.
