Strephon and Cloris, OR, The Coy Shepherd and Kind Shepherdess.
He Is fearful that his Flocks should go astray,
And from her kind embraces would away,
But she with charms does him so setter,
That for to stay he finds it is the better
When slocks and herds and concerns do fail
Love must be satisfied and will prevail.
To the Tune of, Love will find out the way.
This may be Printed, R. P.



AH, Cloris awake,
it is all abroad day,
If you sleep any longer,
our Flocks they will stray:
Lie still my dear Shepherd,
and do not rise yet,
For it is a cold windy Morning,
and b^^^^es it is wet.
My Cloris make haste,
for it is no such thing,
Our time we do waste,
for the Lark is on Wing:
Besides I do fancy
I hear the young Lambs,
Cry, ba, ba, ba, ba,
for the loss of their Dams.
My Shepherd I come,
though i am all over sorrow,
But I swear I Will not love you,
if you rise so to morrow:
For methinks it is unkind,
thus early to rise,
And not did me good morrow,
brings tears front my eyes,
O hark, my dear Cloris,
before thou shall weep,
I Will stay to embrace thee,
neglecting my sleep:
My Flocks they may wander
one hour, two, or three,
But if I loose thy favor,
I ruined shall be.
I joy, my dear Shepherd,
to hear thee say so.
It cases my heart of
much Sorrow and woe:
And for thy reward
I will give thee a Kiss,
And then thou shall taste
of a true Lover's Bliss.
But, Cloris behold how
bright Phoebus his Beams,
Invites us to go
to the murmuring streams:
I hear the brave Huntsmen
both follow the Cry,
And makes the Woods ring,
yet how stuggish am I.
The Hounds and the Huntsmen,
may follow the Chase,
Whilst we enjoy pleasure
in a fat better Place:
Thou know my dear shepherd,
there is no delight,
Like Lovers enjoyment
from Morning till Night.
Alas! my dear Cloris,
what do thou require,
The care of my Flocks
does abate my desire;
The Lambs are new yeaned,
and tender for prey,
And I fear the five Woolf
he should bear them away.
My love do not fear it,
the Woolf he is fled,
To take up his Lodging
in his Mossy Bed;
Then let me Embrace thee,
Whilst we do agree,
And I do promise to go,
thou shall after be free.
Ah! Cloris thy words
are so powerful to me,
That I could be willing
to tarry with thee:
Therefore to content thee,
one hour I will stay,
But I vow by God Capid,
I will then go away.
Now I have my wishes,
dear Shapherd we will part,
Although thou do carry
away my poor heart:
I bless the great Gods
that to Lovers are kind,
To bring us together,
such Bliss for to find.
Then farewell dear Cloris,
till I see thee again,
For now I will haste to
my Flocks on the Plain;
Where I will record
thy true love in such Rhimes,
For Shepherds do admire
in succeding times.
