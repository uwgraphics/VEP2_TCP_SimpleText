PROPOSALS FOR Printing by Subscription, Cambden's Britannia, English.
Newly Translated with Large ADDITIONS.
CAMBDEN's BRITANNIA in English being very Scarce and Dear, the Price of a Fair
one being at present no less then Three Pound, though the Edition be but a very
bad one, and the Translation very ill; diverse Gentlemen have long desired the
Re-printing of it in English, and to the doing thereof great numbers have
already Contributed by Subscriptions: It is thought fit for the general
Advantage, that these Proposals for Printing the said Book by Subscription be
made public.

The Reputation and Worth of the Author and Book is so universally known that
nothing need be said here to Recommend it, except the Account of the Method to
be used in Printing this Edition, which shall be Printed in a fair Character,
and on very good Paper, according to this Specimen.

The whole Book new Translated from the Original, which several Gentlemen of
great Learning and Skill in the Antiquities of ENGLAND have undertaken to do.

In the former Translation made by Doctor Philemon Holland, many Additions of
the Translator, were by a very unwarantable Liberty inserted into the Text,
which are here put as Notes only at the end of the Page.

The Additions will be these,
A new Account of Mr. Cambden's Life and Works shall be given at large.

A Map of England as in the times of the Romans will be Printed according to
Antoninus's Itinerary, with the Names and Situation of the Roman Towns,
Colonies, and Ways.

A Corrected Map of England as in the time of the Saxons will be Printed in
like manner.

A general Map of England, Scotland, and Ireland; as also a particular Map of
each County, by Mr. Robert Morden, according to the newest Surveys that have
been made, together with all the Roads exactly marked out, and all the Places
mentioned by Cambden, inserted, though many of them have by time been quite
destroyed.

All the Discoveries that have been made in several Counties since Mr.
Cambden's Death, in the particular Histories of well nigh half the Counties of
England, and in several Manuscripts and Histories, shall be added in short as
Notes, or set forth in the Dissertation following the whole Work; together with
an Account of all those Authors that have Illustrated England in General, or
any one County in Particular.

An Account of the Universities, Colleges, Schools, Coins, Buildings of
England, and the Seats of the present Nobility, shall be added at the end of
the Work.

The Manuscript Notes and Corrections of Mr. John Seldom will be added to the
Work, as likewise several other Corrections of Eminent Persons upon the whole
Work, or on part thereof, will be added in the Margin or at the bottom of the
Page, and not intermixed with the Text.

To which purpose, all Gentlemen that have made any such Corrections or Remarks
are desired to Transmit them to the Undertakers who will faithfully Insert them.

The large Discourse of Mr. Cambden concerning the Government of the Romans and
Saxons in England, concerning the Degrees in England, and the Courts of
Britain, will by large Marginal Notes be much Corrected and Improved, and some
Original Discourses on that Subject will be added by an Eminent Hand.

Diverse large INDEX'S and GLOSSARIES will be added at the end of the Work.

PROPOSALS.
THE Price of this Book to be but Twenty Six Shillings in Sheets to
Subscribers, whereof twelve Shillings to be paid in Hand, and the rest on
Delivery.

And for Encouragement to Subscribers, any Gentleman that shall Subscribe for
six Books shall have a seventh Gratis, which reduces the Price to Twenty Two
Shillings and Four Pence per Book.

It shall not be Sold to any but Subscribers under Thirty Shillings in Sheets.

The Book shall be Finished and be ready to be Delivered at Michaelmas Term
next, without fail.

BRITAIN.
BRITAIN, by the Latins called Britannia, and Albion, by the Greeks (...), and
(...), the most Famous Island of the whole World, is divided from the Continent
of Europe by the Ocean. It lies over against Germany and France in a Figura
Triquetra. Ces. Com. l. 5.
Triangular Form, by reason of Three Promontories shooting out into diverse
parts, viz. Belerium [the Lands End] toward the West; Cantium [the Foreland in
Kent] toward the East; Tarvisium or Orcas [the Point of Cathness in Scotland]
toward the North. On the West, where Ireland lies, the Vergivian [or Western]
Sea breaks in; On the North it is beaten upon by the vast and wide Northern
Sea: On the East, where it Coasteth upon Germany, it is washed by the German
Ocean; On the South over against France by the British. Thus divided by a
convenient Distance from these Neighboring Nations, and made fit by its open
Harbors for the Traffic of the whole World, it seems to thrust itself forward
on every side into the Sea, for the general Benefit of Mankind. For between
Kent and Calais in France it carries it self so far into the Sea, See in Kent.
and the Channel is so straight, that That Britain was even by an Isthmos
joined Eastward to the Continent of France^ seems an Improbable Opinion.
However, you may see (besides Authorized by Mr. Cambden) White's Hist. Brit^.
Not. 11. Burton's Comment ^n A^. p. 18.19. T^in. de Rebus ^^bion and Britan.
Samm^s, Britan. ^. 1. c. 4. Verstegan, l. 1. c. 4. Some Foreigners also,
Dominicus, M^^iu^. Niger, Antonius Volscus; Vivia^^s, and Da Bartas have
favored this groundless Tradition.
some are of opinion that a Breach was there made, and that the Sea has worked
it self through the Neck of Land, which before joined the two Countries to each
other; and to confirm this they bring Virgil in tha^ Verse,

Et penitus toto divisos Orb Britannos. And Britann's far from all the World
disjoined.

Because as Servius Honoratus says, Britain was anciently joined to the
Continent. Thus Claudian in Imitation of Virgil,

-- Nostro diducta Britannia Mundo. And Britain severed from our World.

It is not at all unlikely that the outward Face and Fashion of the Earth may
by the Deluge and other Causes have been altered, that some Mountains may have
been raised and heightened, and many High Places may have sunk into Plains and
Valleys; Lakes and Meers may have been dried up, and dry Places may have become
Lakes and Meers, and some Islands may have been torn and broken off from the
Continent. But whether it be true indeed, and whether there were any Islands
before the Flood. I shall not here argue, nor of God's Works inconsiderately
give my Opinion. All know that the Divine Providence has disposed different
things to the same end: And indeed it has always been allowed, as well by
Divines as Philosophers, That Isles scattered in the Sea do as equally
contribute to the Beauty of the whole World in general, as the vast extent of
Lakes and the height of Mountains upon Land.

Livy and Fabius Rusticus have made the Form of this [Island] to resemble an
Scutube Oblongae.
Oblong Platter, or Bip^nni. See Sir H. Savile upon this place in Tacitus.
Two edged Ax; and such certainly is its Shape toward the South, (as Tacitus
observes) which yet has been ill applied to the whole Island. But Northward
that vast Tract of Land shooting forward to a Point, grows narrow and sharp
like a Wedge. The Ancients thought it so great, and so very large in
Circumference, that Caesar, The Panegyric spoken to Constantius, falsely
Entitled to Maximian.
who first of all the Romans discovered it, wrote that he had found out another
World, supposing it so great, that it seemed not to be surrounded with the Sea,
but even to contain and encompass the Ocean. And Julius Solinus Polyhistor
asserts, That for its largeness, it almost deserved to be called another World.
Nevertheless, our Age, by many and often Surveys, have now well nigh found the
true Dimensions of the whole Isle. For from Tarvisium [the Point of Cathness]
unto Belerium [the Lands end] reckoning the windings and turnings of the Shores
along the West, are computed about DCCCXII Miles, from thence along the Coasts
as they bend Southward to Cantium [the Kentish Foreland] CCCXX Miles; hence
Coasting by the German Ocean with crooked Creeks and Inlets for DCCIV Miles, it
reaches to Tarvisium [the Point of Cathness] So that by this Computation the
whole Island is in Circuit MDCCCXXXIV Miles. Which Measure, as it falls much
short of Pli^y's, so it is somewhat less then Caesar's: Schitinius Chius is not
worth my mentioning, Com. l. 5.
who in Apollonius (having among other Wonders, told us strange Stories of
Fruits growing in Britain without Kernels, and Grapes without Stones,) makes
its Circuit CCCC Stadia [Furlongs] and no more. But Dionysius after in his
Description of the World, has given a much better Account of the British
Islands, that is, Britain and Ireland.

(...)
(...)
Vast is the Compass of the British Coasts;
A like Extent no Rival Island boasts.
And with him Aristides and other Greek Writers agree, who by way of Excellency
have truly called Britain (...) the Great Island.

Now they that have more accurately compared the Spaces of Heaven with the
Tracts of Earth, have placed Britain under the VIIIth. Climate, and include it
within the XVIIIth. and XXVIth. Parallels: They also ^om^ute the longest Day at
XVIII Equinoctial Hours and an half. But Belerium [the Lands end by reason of
the Unequal Situation of the Earth they place XVI Degrees and L Scruples from
the furthest Point Westward; Cantium [the Kentish Foreland] XXI Degrees of
Longitude. As for the Latitude they Measure in the Southern Parts L Degrees, X
Scruples; at Tarvisium [Cathness] LIX Degrees, XL Scruples. So that according
to this Situation, both as to Air and Soil, Britain may be accounted most happy
and temperate. The Air is so S^ and Gentle, that not only the Summers are less
Sultry, (the continual Breezes still allaying the Heats, refreshing the Fruits
of the
