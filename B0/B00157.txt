A merry new Ballad, both pleasant and sweet, In praise of the Blacksmith,
which is very meet.
To the tune of Green sleeves, etc.


OF all the Trades that ever I see,
There is none with the Blacksmith compared may be,
For with so many several tools Works he,
Which no body can deny.
The first that ever thunderbolt made,
Was a Cyclops of the Black-smiths Trade,
As in an ancient Poet is said,
Which no body can deny.
When thunderingly we lay about,
The fire like lightning flasheth out,
Which suddenly with water we doubt,
Which no body can deny.
The fairest goddess in the skies,
To marry with Vulcan did devise,
Who was a Blacksmith grave and wise,
Which no body can deny.
Mulciber to do her all the right,
Did build her a Tower by day and by night,
Which after he did Hammersmith hight,
Which no body can deny.
And that no enemy might wrong her,
He gave her a Fort, she needs no stronger
Then is the lane of Ironmonger,
Which no body can deny.
Vulcan farther did acquaint her,
A pretty estate he would appoint her,
And leave her Seacole lane for a Ioynter,
Which no body, etc.
Smith-field he did free from dirt,
And sure he had great reason for it:
For there he meant she should keep her Court
Which no etc.
But after in good time and tide
It was to the Blacksmith ratified,
And given by Edmund Ironside,
Which no body, etc.
Vulcan he did make a train,
In which the god of War was slain,
Which ever since was called Paul's chain,
Which no body, etc.
And Ninus bred himself much strife,
For which he surely lost his life,
For doting on a Black-smiths wife,
Which no body, etc.
There is a law in merry England,
In which the Smith has some command,
When any man is burnt in the hand,
Which no body, etc.
Banbury-ale a two-yard pot,
The devil a Tinker dare stand to it,
If once the tossed be hissing hot,
Which no body, etc.
The common Proverb as we read,
That we should hit the nail on the head,
Without the Blacksmith cannot be said
Which no body, etc.
The second part
to the same Tune.
ANother Proverb must not be forgot,
For it falls unto the Black-smiths lot,
That we should strike while the Iron's hot,
Which no body can deny.
A third lies in the Black-smiths way,
When things are as safe as old wives say,
We have them under lock and key,
Which no body, etc.
There Is yet another which makes me laugh,
Because the Smith can challenge but half,
When things are as plain as a pike-staffe,
Which no body, etc.
Another half to him does belong,
And therefore do the Smith no wrong,
When one is held to it buckle and thong.
Which no body, etc.
There is one more does seldom fail,
When we meet with naughty Beer or Ale,
We say it is as dead as a doore-naile,
Which no body, etc.
A sullen woman needs no leech,
Your Black-smiths bellows restores her speech,
And will fetch again with wind in her breech,
Which no body, etc.
There Is never a slut if filth ouer-smuch her,
But owes to the Blacksmith for her lether:
For without a pair of tongs no man will touch her,
Which no body, etc.
If you cleave to your friend when fortunes wheel
Does make him any mischances feel,
We say such a friend is as true as steel,
Which no body, etc.
There Is that is in the Black-smiths books,
Who suddenly for remedy looks,
When any man is off the hooks,
Which no body, etc.
Among the Sectaries there are those,
That without the Black-smiths help do suppose,
St. Dunston had never taken ye devil by the nose,
Which no body, etc.
The roaring boy whom every one quails,
And nothing but fights, and swears, and railes,
Could never yet make ye Smith eat his nails,
Which no body, etc.
Though Sergeants at Law grow richer far,
And by their good counsel can end a far:
Yet your Blacksmith taks more pains at the bar,
Which no body, etc.
And though laws punish severely still
Such as counterfeit deeds, and thereby do ill,
Yet your smith may forge what he will,
Which no body, etc.
Though bankrouts lie lurking in their holes,
And laugh at their creditors and the catchpoles,
Yet the Smith can fetch them over the coals,
Which no body, etc.
Though playing ye Iocky is thought a fine feat,
As to train up a horse and prescribe him his meat,
Yet the Smith knows best how to give him a heat,
Which no body, etc.
Though soldiers have traueld a thousand miles,
And think they have all the crafts and ye wiles,
Yet your Smith can sooner double his files,
Which no body, etc.
And though he has no Commanders look,
Nor can brag of those he has slain or took,
Yet is he as good as ever struck,
Which no body, etc.
Then if to know him men did desire,
They would not scorn but rank him higher
For what he gets is out of the fire,
Which no body, etc.
Then here is a health to the Black-smiths all,
And let it go round as round as a ball,
Let Us take it though it cost us a fall,
Which no body can deny.
FINIS.
