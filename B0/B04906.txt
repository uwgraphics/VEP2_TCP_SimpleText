The Parliament Dissolved at OXFORD, March 28. 1681.
From Devonshire.
UNder 500 KINGS Three Kingdoms groan:
Go F. Dissolve them, CHARLES is in the Throne,
And by the Grace of God will Reign alone.
What would the Commons have? the Royal Line
Heaven does dispose of; It Is not Theirs, nor Mine,
But His by whom KINGS Rule, and are Divine.
I Represent the KING of KINGS who gave,
The Crown, the Sword, the Scepter; What I have;
I am Gods Servant, not the Peoples Slave.
Their Frantic Votes, and Mad Resolves I hate;
I know a better way to Heal a STATE,
Than to Sin Rashly, and Repent too late.
Bid them be gone F. They are Damned Uncivil,
To oblige Me to follow them to th'Devil;
To Save Three Kingdoms I will not do Evil.
The Presbyterian's Sick of too much Freedom,
Are ripe for Bethle'm; it is high time to Bleed'em;
The Second CHARLES does neither Fear nor Need'em.
I Will have the World know that I can Dissipate
Those Impolitick Mushrooms of our STATE;
It Is easier to Dissolve than to Create.
They shall not Cramp Justice with their Feigned Flaws;
For since I Govern only by the LAWS;
Why They should be Exempt, I see no Cause.
To the LAWS They must Submit; it is in vain
E're to Attempt to shake off those again;
For where CHARLES Commands, There must Justice Reign
When the Peoples Father does Espouse the LAW,
All those who Subjects from their Duty draw,
Do Viper-like, through Parents Bosom gnaw.
When They Attend Me next, F. Bid Them bring
Calmer Thoughts; Bid Them Propose Legal Things;
Such as may both become Themselves, and KINGS.
This will the Joys of Our Little World Complete,
And all Attempts of Foreign Foes Defeat;
Making the People Happy, MONARCH Great.
FINIS.
