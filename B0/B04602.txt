Of the faithful Friendship that lasted between two faithful Friends.
To the Tune of, Flying Fame.
IN stately Rome sometimes did dwell,
a man of noble Fame.
Who had a son of seemlie shape,
Alphonso was his name:
When he was grown and come to age,
his Father thought it best.
To send his son to Athens fair.
where wisedoms School did rest.
And when he was at Athens come,
good Lectors for to learn*
A place to board him with delight,
his friends did well discern.
A noble Knight of Athens Town,
of him did take the charge,
Who had a son Gancelo called,
just of his pitch and age.
In stature and in person both,
in favor, speech, and face:
In quality and condition eke,
they 'greed in everle place.
So like they were in all respects,
the one unto the other;
They were not known but by their face,
of Father nor of Mother.
And as in favor they were found
alike in all respects;
Then so they did most dearly love,
as proved by good respect.
Gancelo loved a Lady fair,
which did in Athens dwell:
Who was in beauty peerlesse found,
so far she did excel.
Upon a time it chanced so,
as fancy did him move;
That he would visit for delight,
his Lady and his love:
And to his true and faithful friend,
he did declare the same:
Asking of him if he would see,
that fair and comely Dame.
Alphonso did thereto agree,
and with Gancelo went:
To see the Lady which he loved,
which bred his discontent,
But when he cast his crystal eyes,
upon her angels hue:
The beauty of that Lady bright,
did straight his heart subdue,
His gentle heart so wounded was,
with that fair Lady face,
That afterward he dally lived
in sad and woeful case.
And of his grief he knew not how
thereof to make an end:
For that he knew the Ladies love,
was yielded to his friend.
Thus being sore perplexed in mind,
upon his bed he lay:
Like one which death and deep despair
had almost worn away:
His friend Ganselo that did see,
his grief and great distress:
At length resquested for to know,
his cause of heaviness,
With much ado at length he told
the truth unto his friend:
Who did release his inward woe,
with comfort to the end.
Take courage then dear friend, quoth he,
though she through love be mine:
My right I will resign to thee,
the Lady shall be thine.
You know our favors are alike,
our speech alike likewise:
This day is mine apparel then
you shall your self disguise.
And unto Church then shall you go,
directly in my stead;
So though in my friends suppose it is I
you shall the Lady wed.
Alphonso was so well apaid:
and as they had decreed,
He went a day, and wedded plain
the Lady there in deed.
But when the Nuptial feast was done,
and Phoebus quite was fled,
The Lady for Ganselo took
Alphonso to her bed.
That night they spent in pleasant sport,
and when the day was come,
A Post for fair Alphonso came,
to fetch him home to Rome.
Then was the matter plainly proved,
Alphonso wedded was,
And not Ganselo to that Dame,
which brought great woe alas.
Alphonso being come to Rome,
with this his Lady gay;
Ganseloes friends and kindred all
in such a rage did stay.
That they deprived him of his wealth
his lands and rich attire,
And banished him their Country quite
in rage and wrathful ire.
With sad and pensive thoughts alas,
Ganselo wandered then,
Who was through Want constrained to beg,
relief of many men.
In this distress often would he say,
to Rome I mean to go,
To seek Alphonso my dear friend,
who will relieve my woe.
To Rome when poor Ganselo came,
and found Alphonsoes place,
Which was so famous, huge and fair,
himself in such poor case,
He was ashamed to show himself
in that his poor array.
Saying, Alphonso knows me well,
if he should come this way.
Wherefore he staid within the street,
Alphonso then came by,
But heeded not Ganselo poor,
his friend that stood so nigh.
Which grieved Ganselo to the heart,
quoth he, and is it so:
Does proud Alphonso now disdain
his friends to need to know.
In desperate sort away he went
into a Barn hard by,
And presently he drew his knife,
thinking thereby to die;
And bitterly in sorrow there
he did lament and weep.
And being over weighed with grief
he there fell fast asleep.
Where soundly there he sweetly sleept
came in a murdering thief,
And with a naked knife, lay by
this man so full of grief.
This knife so bright he took up straight,
and went away amain,
And thrust it into a murdered a man
which he before had slain,
And afterward he went with speed
and put this bloody knife
Into his hand that sleeping lay,
to save himself from strife;
Which done, in haste away he ran:
and when that search was made
Ganselo with his bloody knife
was for the murder staid;
And brought before the Magistrate,
who did confess most plain,
That he indeed with that same knife
the murdered man had slain.
Alphonso sitting there as Judge,
and knowing Ganseloes face,
To save his friend, did say himself
was guilty in that case.
None quoth Alphonso, killed the man,
my Lord, but only I:
And therefore set this poor man free,
and let me justly die.
Then while for death these loving friends
in striving did proceed,
The man before the Senate came,
which did the fact indeed;
Who being moved with remorse,
their friendly hearts to see,
Did prove before the judges plain,
none did the fact but he.
Thus when the truth was plainly told
of all sides joy was seen:
Alphonso did embrace his friend,
which had so woeful been.
In rich array he clothed him,
as fitted his degree;
And helps him to his lands again,
and former dignity.
The murderer, for telling truth,
had pardon at that time.
Who afterward lamented much,
his soul and grievous crime,
FINIS.
