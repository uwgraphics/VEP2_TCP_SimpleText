The Zealous Lover.
He strives for to illustrate her Perfection
who now has brought him under Loves subjection,
No task so hard he will undergo
if that she will but Love unto him show
What ever can be had, shall be her own
if she will yield to fancy him alone.
To the Tune of, Underneath the Green wood Tree, etc.




COme prethy Love let me prepare,
my zealous affection to declare,
And set forth thy admired parts,
which captivates so many hearts,
T^ou art the Phoenix of our days,
and shall for beauty bear the praise.
Then prithee fairest fancy me,
and let me not languish in misery.
Thy pretty rolling sparkling eyes
of my poor heart has made a prize,
Thy Che^ry Cheeks and dimpled Chin
affection from all hearts do win:
Thy hair like Amber does appear
or t^r^ads of Gold which shine so clear,
Th^n prithee dearest, etc.
Each smile that does proceed from thee,
debars me of my liberty,
Since every word that thou can say
might lead a thousand hearts astray.
Thy beauty in each part does shine
where all the Graces do combine,
Then prethy fairest, etc.
When first I did thy face admire,
my senses all were set on fire:
My heart with Love was sore inflamed,
when as I heard thee once but named;
No happiness on Earth could be
like to enjoy a kiss from thee,
Then prithee, etc.


I Will Crown thy joys with hearts content,
if thou to love me wilt consent
And all delights that ere can be,
shall daily wait and tend on thee.
Thou shall have pleasures at command;
and servants ready at thy hand:
Then prithee fairest fancy me
and let me not languish in misery.
No Lady that in Court does dwell,
in rich attire shall thee excel
For Silks and Satins fine and brave
and costly jewels thou shall have;
All sorts of Music thou shall hear
sweet pleasures harmony to the ear
Then prethy fairest fancy etc.
All in a pleasant shady Grove,
we will walk to recreate my Love,
And sit down by a Crystal Spring
whilst pretty birds do chirp and sing,
With hand in hand we will pass the time
in Summer when flowers are in the prime,
Then prithee, etc.
I Will range throughout the world so wide
for Pearls of price to please my Bride
And what new fashions may be had.
i will bring thee home to make thee glad,
Thou shall be like the Indian Queen
so rich and costly to be seen.
Then,
Why should thy Maidenhead do thee wrong
by keeping of the same too long
Since that by marriage thou will be
complete and live most happily.
Who dies a maid (it is spoke right well)
must ever expect to lead Apes in Hell,
Then, etc.
If little Cupid bend his Bow,
twill be in vain to resist you know
The god of Love will angry be
if you despise his Deity:
It were far better for to yield
and sport your time in Venus field.
Then etc.
There is no joys in single life
compared to a married wife,
Where Pleasures all completed are
beyond your expectation far:
What heart can wish may there be had
to make a loving couple glad.
Then prithee, etc.
Therefore my dear be not afraid
to change the title of a maid
But let me hear your answer kind
to satisfy your longing mind
With open arms i will thee embrace,
when we encounter face to face
Then prithee fairest fancy me
and let me not languish in misery.

Bridge.
