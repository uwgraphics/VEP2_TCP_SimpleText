The Shepherds Glory: OR,
A pleasant Song o'th Shepherd Swain,
Who feed their Flocks upon the plain
Whose Arms and Honor far out-shines
The Coesar's and great Constantines.
To the Tune of, True love rewarded with loyalty: Or, Flora Farewell.






Now I am in a merry vein,
I Will sing about the Shepherd Swain;
Who night and day the Fields do keep,
To wait upon the flocks of Sheep.
In Royal Tombs some of them lie,
And are of great Antiquity:
Their Ancientry quite out does run,
To Father Adams second Son,
Who though he was by's Brother slain,
Yet first he was a Shepherd Swain;
Who did a Lamb to the Alter bring,
And made it his burnt Offering.
The Lamb was innocent from harms,
And thence became the Shepherds Arms:
The ignorant do little know,
The Royal Escutcheons they can show.
The Second part,
the same Tune.
The next man that in the field appears,
Was Abraham with his Ram in the briers,
But if he lead them in the Hain,
A Whistle brings them back again.
And Jacob gained the Cherubim,
When the Angel was overcome by him:
Where like a Prince he did prevail,
And changed his name to Israel.
The Knitter and the Tailor too,
Without the Fleece can little do:
Were it not for the Shepherd Swain,
The Wheel and Loom were made in vain.
And Moses brought the Bush on fire,
And joined to Abraham's Ram in the Brier:
And Judah Father of the Kings,
The mighty Couching Lion brings.
A Bear and Lion both were slain,
When David was a Shepherd swain:
Three Shepherds came from East so far,
Their only guide the Shepherds star.
These were the tidings they did bring,
To Israel is born a King:
And David used the staff and sling,
Before that he was Judah's King.
But when he had Goliath stain,
He left those Army to the shepherd swain:
Which in those days were of Renown,
When Moses spurned at Pharoahs Crown.
And left the Court and took the Fields,
Which braver sport and pleasure yields:
Which are bestrew'd with pleasant flowers,
And are bedewed with Crystal showers.
Which makes their Beauty to excel,
And send forth a most fragrant smell:
Where Nightingales in the Bushes sing,
For to salute the early spring.
Where towering Larks do soar on high,
In consort, making Melody:
Where Chanting Birds in the woods do sing
Which makes the hallow Valleys ring.
Where flocks of sheep staight on the dounds,
And shepherds guide and keep their bounds:
And lead them into Valleys green,
Where chrystial streams, the hills between.
Do trickle down and freely spring,
Which makes the shepherd swains to sing:
A Horned sheep a Bell does Ring,
And guides the rest much like a King.
And from the hot and scorching Sun,
The Groves do shade the flock at Noon:
The Shepherd with his Pipe and Reed,
Makes Melody, while they do feed.
A Box of Tar a Dog does bear,
Which is for Sheep an Ointment rare:
The use whereof all Shepherds know,
Therefore in vain the Fly does blow.
Though Frost and snow do pinch with cold,
The Shepherd will not leave his Fold:
And carefully his flock does feed,
But does supply what else they need.
And while the Ews do eat their Hay,
The Lambs do frisk about and play:
The Shepherd's pleased for to behold,
The Lambs a dancing round the Fold.
None with the Shepherd may compare,
For useful and substantial Ware:
It Is with the Fleece that Women Spin,
And so the Weaving trade comes in.
Now Shepherds I leave you all,
To him that does and ever shall;
Who can alone in safety keep,
The pleasant Shepherds and their Sheep.
