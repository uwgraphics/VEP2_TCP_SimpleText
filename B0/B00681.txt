Ane Complaint upon Fortoun
IN constant world fragill and friuolus,
with feineit Fortoun, quha confides in the:
sall find his life cairfull and cruellus,
Led in this vale of woeful misery,
Quhat potent Princes in prosperity,
Hes sho deposd from their imperial places.
Her craft quotidian, we may cleirly se
As men in mirrouris may behauld their faces.
The worthy Bocas in his moral buke,
The fall of Princes plainly dois compyle.
Amangs them all quha ever lykes to luke,
Sall find Dame Fortounis favor for a quhyle.
For with the one eye sho can lauch and smyle,
And with the other lurk and play the loun.
Sum to promotioun, and some to plain exile,
Like draw well bukkets dowkand up and down.
That variable Witch makis all the world ado,
Quhat Kingis and Countries hes sho brocht to end
Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans to,
The Monarchs four micht not her force defend.
Bulworkis nor battellis bydis her nocht a bend,
Quha may withstand her straik, quhan sho lift stryke,
This nicht aneuch, the morn nathing to spend,
Imago in Luna, and sho lukis both alyke,
To pen the speciallis it passis money a hunder,
And makis the time over tidious to declare.
Sum sho promouis and sum sho puttis to under,
And sum rewards with wandering heir and their,
And sum incastrat captives in the snair,
And sum for flatrie dois her freindship find.
To all estates vntruethfull quhat sold mair,
Turnand her volt like woddercok in wind.
To paint her out it passis mine ingyne.
How wonderfully sho wirkes in all their thingis.
Sum fra their birth brocht up with Doggis and swine
Taken fra the Pleuch and placit in sait of Kingis.
The brutell beist ane harbor wolf vpbringis,
The first borne Romain callit Romulus.
Quhais bind as it into that regioun ringis,
By expectatioun of auld Amelius.
Cyrus siclyke was be ane Bitche vpbrocht,
Cround as a King ane cruel man of weir.
Pareis in troy that all the town forthocht.
Preseruit from slauchter be souking of a Beir.
And swa was Thylaphus with ane Hind I heir,
Medas With Imates and maid ane michtie Prince.
Plato with beis quha did sic prudence leir,
That all men meruelled of his Eloquence.
Without respect to blude royal or clan,
^ureanis promouit that na man wald presume.
Torquinius Pristus a baneist merchant man,
Chaist out of Corinth and Cround a King in Rome.
Siclyke was Seruius from ane shipherd grome,
And Tullus Bostilius fand her favor neist.
Is, was, and salbe quhill the day of dome,
Sic doubill dealing in Dame Fortounis breist.
Quha findis her freindship of favor hes aneuch,
To warldly glore sho gydes them all that gait.
Tuke sho not Gordias from the Spaid and Pleuch,
And quickly placit him in Princes sait.
How far may Darius brag of her debait,
Taken fra the Stabil over Persia to ring.
Duce agathocles from a law estait,
Ane Potteris boy to be ane potent King.
Of Iustine the Suinehird sho maid ane empriour
Over Constantinople ane King and cround him their,
Gyges the Gait hird ane michtie Conqueror,
To Lydia land she maid him Lord and air.
and Wallancianus from his landwart fair,
Taken fra the Pleuch to place Imperial.
Cambyses Nero be the contrair clair,
Was their awin burresis to their burial.
Sa Fortoun mountit never man sa hie,
Fostered with Folly Suppose she make them fane.
Bot with ane tit sho turnis the quheill e sie,
Down gois their heid up gois their heillis again.
Of Alexander to write I war bot vain,
Over Fifty landis he lord was at the leist.
it threttie dayis lay after he was slain,
Vnbureit in Babell like a brutell beist,
Xerxes quhose armeis maid the riueris dry,
and Schippis subumbragit all the seyis on breid.
Did sho not wait him with sic foul Inuy,
Pray to Pericles yat put him to his speid.
Of Julius Caesar gif thou lykes to reid,
In his triumphant town victorious.
Slain be his Senatis schamefully in deid,
By his awin kinsmen Brutus and Cassus.
Sum auld example heir I man Induce,
To bring my purpose to more special.
Quha was mair worthy gif I wald make ruse,
More stout more true, nor hardy Hanniball.
Danter of Romans to Carthage ane Castle wall,
The only thing quhairin he may reioysit.
Do quhat he docht in deidis marciall,
By his awin pepill petiously deposed.
Siclyke was Sipio faiklesly schot forth,
That vinqueist Hanniball like a warrior wicht.
His valiant works was weyit bot litill worth,
Quhen he was baneist with a bair good nicht.
Nor like a captain nor kindly Knicht,
Bot like ane beggar baneist in exile,
Sa Fortoun montit never man on hicht,
Bot sho can law him within a litill quhyle.
Alchebead of athenis was Duke,
Of Princely Parents and ane royal race.
To keip his town sic travel vndertuke,
He maid his fo men fle befoir his face.
To his reward he gat nane other grace,
Ingraitly baneist to their awin grit skaith.
and Tymistocles in that samin place,
by their awin burgessis they were baneist both,
Experience teiches me not to flyte with Fortoun*
With auld examples that dois na thing belang us.
Mark James of Douglas present Earl of Morton,
ane of the best that ever was borne amang us.
Danter of cheuis that daily dois over gang us,
Key of this Country that kepit us from skaith.
I speik na farther in feir they sold gar hang us,
Preichouris and poiettis are put to silence both.
Few things were done bot Mortoun interprisit them
Dumbar and Brichane and money vthair bloke:
Speik quhat they pleis he wrocht the^ and deuisit them,
He and his freindis ay formest in the flock
He faucht our querrell as kein as any Cok,
Reuengit our murders ma nor two or thrie.
ane nobill man and of ane ancient stoke,
His valiant deidis demereitis not to die.
Ane of the speciallis did mentene our Croun,
our ferme protector in our tender eiris.
He maid ow up and all our to men down,
His marciall manheid did mentein our weiris,
Gif he did wrang reward him as effeiris,
Gif he did good God wald he sold be tret.
bot as the proverb speikis it plain appeiris,
auld men will die and barnes will sone foret.
Was he not rewler over our Realm and Rigioun.
Quhill all was pacifeit be his prudent wit.
Stude he not stoutly be that true Religoiun.
ane of the first that maid the Freiris to flit.
Frauke on the feildis and Formest at the bit,
Without respect to baggis or body to.
our faithfall subject and sua be salbe it.
To do good service as I have seen him do.
Than at Carbarrie hill he held a day,
With litill blude shed bothwell was put a bake,
Quha slew our Father and fibilly fled away,
Syne socht our self to bring this Realm to sa^^
How money Clawbackes than suppose they crak,
Conuenit with Mortoun quhan bothwel tuk ye chase
Try or e tine him and trow not all they spak,
Lat works heir wirnes vain wordis sold have na place
Sone after that the Counsel cround our sell,
Quhan Godly Murray as a Regent rang.
it their was some that bauldly did rebel,
That to our Lawis wald nouther ride nor gang.
quha their conuenit for to revenge our wrang,
albeit our action was thocht innocent.
It was the Dowglassis douchtaly them dang,
and plett our process in that parliament,
Quha could declare our langsum life in Leith,
Fechtand all day and syne lay in our clais.
Gif Lindesay lykes that Lord can tell ow eith,
Quha was our freindis or quha your Mortal fais.
Or quha gaid formest breistand up the braies,
I dar not pen the speciallis I do plain ow.
bot weill I wait how ever the world now gais,
Thai find may freindship was fardest yan agian ou
Syne at Laugsyde field our grace may ken,
Mortoun was their ane man amang the rest.
In Striuiling town out of his dowie deu,
May like a Fox they fyrit him in his nest.
In Edinburgh Castle quhair they war possessed,
He them deplaced that purposit to undo ow.
Quhan e grow auid I wait e will confessed,
Mortoun hes been ane faithful saruand to ow.
Quhan Regentis deit and all the Lytes inlaikit,
The Counsel did conuene and set ane day.
They cheisit him Regent in that rowme yat waikit,
With sad adwise for few or nane said nay
bot it I think they playit our grace foul play,
Gif he was knawin than of their crimes convict.
Gif he be saikles surely I dar say,
They have defamit him with ane fulich trick.
To dant the theuis had he nocht mekill ado,
Abandoned the borders that na man durst rebel.
The Armestrangis Eluottis and the Iohnestons to,
With tuentie other Clans I can not tell.
During his dayis yai durst not ride ane ell,
The Hirdis and hind men in their Labeis lay.
bot their estait as now e sie our sell,
all nicht to walk and fane to wirk all day.
Aganis grit Lordis committing small offense,
With iniust challenge they aucht na man to chessoun,
Mortoun hes ay been vpricht with his Prince,
but spot of crime or any point of tressoun.
Albeit good saruice be not taken in seasoun,
His works may witness he never sparit for perrell.
Laitly accusit but outher ryme or ressoun,
as sindrie schawis me for a saikles querrell.
Daft fulis defyis him because they find him sage
and Cowartis contrarious for his hardiment.
Young men for glaikrie can not agrie with age.
and waisteris inuyis him for his government.
and Sacreit counsel can not be content,
To suffer lordshippis in equality.
it I beseik our grace of good intent,
To play the Prince but parcialitie.
Adwise ow weill sen he hes not offendit,
to keip sic tenattis it sall decore our land.
of raiche detreitis cums rue and may not mend it,
As Scottismens Wisdom dois behind the hand,
Wise lordis are ill ta make I understand,
and trewly in Kingis is to abhor
This sempill counsall Sir is na command,
Bot wald to God that na man louit ow war,
FINIS, quod Sempill.
Imprintit at Edinburgh be Robert Lekprewicke, dwelling at the Netherbow.
