(...) Who was shot to death in the Isle of Man, the 2. of (...) 1^^^
GEntlemen, and the rest of you that have accompanied me this day to the gates
of my death,
I know you do expect I should say something at my departure; and indeed I am
in some measure willing to satisfy you, having not had the least liberty since
my imprisonment to acquaint any with the sadness of my sufferings, which flesh
and blood could not have endured, without the power and assistance of my most
gracious and good God, into whose hands I do now commit my poor soul, not
doubting but that I shall very quickly be in the arms of his mercy.

I am, (as now you see) hurried hither by the power of a pretended Court of
Justice, the members whereof, or the greatest part of them no ways qualified,
but very ill-befitting their now places; the reasons you may give your selves.

The cause for which I am brought hither, as the prompted and threatened Jury
have delivered is High Treason against the Countess Dowager of Derby, for that
I did as they say, in the year fifty one, raise a force against her, for the
suppressing and rooting out that family: How unjust that accusation is, very
few of you that hear me this day but can witness with me, and that the then
Rising of the people, in which afterward I came to be concerned, did not at
all or in the least intend the prejudice or ruin of that honorable family;
the chief whereof as you well remember being dead eight days, or thereabouts,
before that action happened. But the true cause of that rising, as the Jury did
twice bring in, was to present grievances to our honorable Lady, which was
done by me, and after approved of by her Ladyship, under the hand of her then
Secretary Master Treoach, who is yet living; which agreement has since to my
own ruin and my poor families endless sorrows been fore't from me, the Lord
God forgive them the unjustness of their dealings with me, and I wish from my
heart it may not be laid to their charge another day.

You now see me a sacrifice ready to be offered up for that which was the
preservation of your lives and fortunes which then was in hazard, but that I
stood between you and your then (in all appearances) utter ruin. I wish you
still may (as you have hitherto) enjoy the sweet benefit and blessing of peace,
though from that minute until now I have still been prosecuted and persecuted,
nor have I ever since found a place to rest my self in. But now my God be for
ever blessed and praised, that has given me so large a measure of patience.

What services I have done for that honorable Family, by whose power I am now
to take my latest breath, I dare appeal to themselves whether I have not
deserved better things from some of them, then the sentence of my bodily
destruction, and seizure of the poor estate, my Son ought to enjoy being
purchased and left him by his Grandfather. It might have been much better, had
I not spent it in the service of my honorable Lord of Derby and his Family.
These things I need not mention to you, for that most of you are witnesses to
it, I shall now beg your patience whilst I tell you here in the presence of my
God that I never in all my life acted any thing with intention to prejudice my
Sovereign Lord the King, nor the late Earl of Derby, nor the now Earl; yet
notwithstanding being in England at the time of his Sacred Majesty's happy
restoration, I went to London with many others to have a sight of my gracious
King, whom God preserve, and who until then I never had seen, but I was not
long there when I was arrested upon an action of twenty thousand pounds, and
clapped up into the Fleet; unto which Action I being a stranger could give no
Bayl, but was there kept near a whole year. How I suffered there, God he knows;
but at last having gained my liberty, I thought good to advise with several
Gentlemen concerning his Majesty's gracious Act of Indemnity that was then set
forth by his Majesty, in which I thought my self concerned, unto which they
told me there was no doubt to be made but that all actions committed in the
Isle of Man, relating in any kind to the War was pardoned by the Act of
Indemnity, and all other places within his Majesty's Dominions and Countries,
whereupon, and having been forct to absent my self from my poor wife and
children near three years, being all that time under persecution, I did with
great content and satisfaction return into this Island, hoping then to receive
the comfort and sweet enjoyment of my friends and poor Family, But alas I have
fallen into the snare of the Fowler, but my God shall ever be praised, and though
he kill me, yet will I trust in him.

I may justly say no man in this Island knows better then my self the power my
Lord of Derby has in this Island subordinate to his Sacred Majesty, of which
I have given a full account in my Declaration presented to my Judges, which I
much fear must never see light, which is no small trouble to me:

It was his Majesty's gracious Act of Indemnity that gave me the confidence
and assurance of my safety, on which, and an Appeal I made to his Sacred
Majesty and Privy Council, from the unjustnesse of the proceedings held
against me, I did much rely being his Majesty's Subject here, and a Denison of
England both by birth and fortune, and in regard I have disobeyed the power of
my Lord of Derby's Act of Indemnity, which you now all look upon, and his
Majesty's gracious Act cast out, as being of no force, I have with greater
violence been prosecuted; yet nevertheless I do declare, That no Subject
whatsoever can, or ought to take upon them to make Acts of Indemnity, but his
Sacred Majesty only, and confirmation of a Parliament.

It is very fit I should say something as to my Education and Religion; I think
I need not inform any, all of you knowing that I was brought up as a son of the
Church of England, which was at that time in their Splendour and Glory, and to
my endless comfort I have ever since continued a faithful member; witness
several of my actions in these late times of Liberty, against Quakers, etc. and
as for Government, I never was against Monarchy, which is now to my souls great
satisfaction, I have lived to see it thoroughly settled and established, well
assuring my self, that men of upright lives and conversations, may have the
favorable countenance of our gracious good King, under whose happy Government
God of his infinite mercy long continue these His Kingdoms and Dominions; and
now I do most heartily thank my good God, that I have had so much liberty and
time to disburden my self of some things that has lain heavy upon me all the
time of my imprisonment, in which I have not had time or liberty to speak or
write any of my thoughts, and from my soul I wish all animosities may after my
death be quite laid aside, and my death by none called in question, for I do
freely forgive all that has had any hand in my persecutions, and may our good
God preserve you all in peace and quiet all the remainder of your days.

Be ye all of you, as you are His Majesty's Liege people, most loyal and
faithful to His Sacred Majesty; and according to your Oaths of faith and
fealty, to my honorable Lord of Derby, do ye likewise in all just and lawful
ways observe his commands, and know that you must one day give an account of
all your deeds, and now the blessing of Almighty God be with you all, and
preserve you from all violent death, and keep you in peace of conscience all
your days.

I will now hasten, for my flesh is willing to be dissolved, and my spirit to
be with my God, who has given me full assurance of his mercy and pardon for
all my sins, of which his unspeakable goodness and loving kindness, my poor
soul is exceedingly satisfied: and then he falling upon his knees, and having
ended a prayer, in which he showed much of earnestness, he got up exceeding
cheerfully, and calling for the Soldiers, he said unto them, And now for you
that are my executioners by lot, I do here freely forgive you, and in assurance
thereof I will kiss you all, and did so, desiring them, and all present to pray
for his soul; He said there is now but a thin veil betwixt me and death; once
more I desire your prayers, for now I take my last farewell of you all; after
which they intending to bind him to the place where he stood, he told them, you
need not trouble yourselves nor me, for I that dare look death in the face in
what shape soever he appears, will not start at your Fire, nor Bullets, nor can
the power you have, take the least grain of my courage from me; and having
white paper given him upon his desire, he took it and pind it himself upon his
breast to direct the Soldiers where to aim; and turning aside himself he made a
short prayer, after which he said to his executioners, hit this, and you do
yours and my work, and presently after stretching forth his arms, which was
the sign he gave them, received the shots, and yielded up the Ghost, having not
one drop of blood poured out upon the ground, though shot into the heart.

Much more would have been said, to the satisfaction of the world, had be got
the liberty of Pen, Ink or Paper. The above written is only that which he spoke
at the place of execution.
