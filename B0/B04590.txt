A new way of Hunting: Or, the hunting of the wild Boar: Being a compendious
Dialogue between two Lovers,
To the Tune of, Draw the Curtains.


Fair Fidelia, tempt no more,
By no means I thy person will adore,
Nor offer to thy shrine,
The Gods do me injoyne
To spend my time in hunting of the Bore.
^arke, I hear she Huntsman hollow,
To invite
To this fight
Warlike Mars and bright Apollo
The bugle horn do blow,
The Foresters all a row
Are ready pressed
And bravely dressed
Along with them to go.
Fair Fidelia take a kiss.
And at my next return be sure of this,
Thou shall well approve
I do thee dearly love,
Pray pardon at this time what is amiss,
I must leave thee for a space,
Else to choose
And to lose
A more honorable place,
Farewell Cupid's Court,
Welcome Hunters sport:
Now will I
My fortunes try
here gallants do resort.
Fair Fidelia take this Ring,
Keep it in token of a better thing,
I am parting from thee,
Sweet heart think upon me,
Loves conceits do sweet contentments long.
When thou see me mounted brave
On my Steed,
That indeed
Is the thing that I would have,
Let the wild Boar be ware,
And savage Bear take care,
I make no doubt
To root them out
When I approach them near,
Lusty Rurals of the North
Are now prepared and ready to march forth,
Thundering eccho's sounding,
Hills and dales rebdunding
Hounds and huntsmen of courageous (...)
Now the Stars give light again,
Which before
Did adore
And support great Charles his (...)
Since those sports I mind,
I Will not stay behind,
Let day or Night
Be dark or light,
At length I shall them find.
Her Answer, The second part,
To the same Tune.


DEarest Love be not unkind,
To part with me and leave me here behind,
Whilst that thou art wanting,
My heart will break with panting,
Never a minutes comfort shall I find,
The wild Boar and savage Bear,
I do fear,
Will thee tear
When thou in their sight appeared
If that they do not miss,
Serpents they will hiss,
Then never to me,
But stay at home
And change the other kiss.
In the Forest there are more
That seek thy full, besides the ugly Boar;
There Is the stinging Vipers
There Is the poisoning Spiders,
There are Nilus Crocodils great store.
There are Dragons whose strong breath
In an hour
Will devour,
And betray thee unto death:
Rather then do so,
I pray thee do not go:
Stay hear and try
A victory
With me thy friendly foe.
In the stead of Forests strong,
I Will find a fitter Cops for thee to range;
Hoar stands a pleasant Bed,
soft Pillows for thy head,
Where thou and I will sweet encounters change:
Now hunt and do not spare.
Venus game
Is the same
Will redound unto thy share;
Try me as thou will,
Prove thy chiefest skill,
Do thou thy best
I Will do the rest
And to be for thee still.
Take thy Ring and Kiss again
For every one thou giv'st i will give thee ten,
Use thou no denial:
Put me to the trial,
Beauteous Maids does love courageous men,
Gentle Cupid bend thy bow,
Shoot a dart
at his heart,
That the Hunters all may know,
That he is mine by right,
My joy and hearts delight
It Is better still
With me to bill,
Then with the Boar to fight.
