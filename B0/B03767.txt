Islington Wells
SONG Of all the Virtues of those old Waters, Newly found out: With all
preparations that are making for Young Wives that have unkind Husbands.
To the Tune of -- Come Boys fill us a Bumper.
I.
Lodon Lasses make ready,
Repair for Jslington;
Young Widows, young Wives or Lady,
Whilst all your Husbands are gone,
For Epsom, Tunbridge or Duledge;
For Water, Wenches or Wine,
To make them return all with full heads:
You never had so happy a time.
II.
Although Madddm Fickle does scorn it,
Because it is near the Town,
And forty brisk Dames forewarned,
Their husbands all being at home;
Yet these are the Waters approved,
By Docters kind to the crowd;
They swore to the Sisters beloved,
'Twill make your giggs frisk it about.
III.
The Tailors are now in the Country,
Cucumbers are plentiful there;
To make their Wives a fair Entry,
These Waters are wholesome and clear,
Expelling all dregs of obstruction,
Til blood flows fresh in their veins;
They freely will spend their production,
On such as will take little pains.
IV.
Convenient house prepareing,
For private and public Souls,
For Venus Adorers to share in,
Inspired with lustful Bowls;
Where Doctors are daily attending,
For each Complexion takes care,
Kind looks your kind hearts recomending
Prefers your commodities there.
V.
You need not to fear betraying,
Your Gallants come most in disguise
In Ladys apparel for staying,
Till they have obtained the prize;
Sweet gardens and arbours of pleasure,
For Amorous souls and delights,
Wherein you may reap all the Treasure
For which you have languisht some nights.
VI.
These Waters are always in season,
As well at the Spring as the Fall;
To Crown a kind husband's no Treason,
Guilt Antlars well grafted and tall;
May fetch you a Coach and six horses,
As gay as some at the Court,
Where pleasure and profit inforces,
You needs must be proud of the sport.
