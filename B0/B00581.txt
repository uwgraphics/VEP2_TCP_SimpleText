A Complete Gentlewoman Described by her feature, Her person slender, her
beauty admirable, her wit excellent, her carriage modest, her behavior chaste,
with her constancy in love.
To the tune of Sabina.




YOu Muses all your aid to me assign
To speak in praise of the true love of mine.
Strike up with joy
Strike up with joy
Strike up with joy your instruments of mirth
Till piercing Echoes ring 'twixt heaven and earth.
Let Pan with speed prepare himself to play,
And sweetly chaunt my love a roundelay
While Satyrs peep
While Satyrs peep
While Satyrs peep to see her lovely face,
Let Citterne, harp, and lute her meeting grace.
Let all the Poets company combine
Their wits in one for my sweet Rosaline,
And say that she
And say that she
And say that she Queen Venus does excel,
For beauty, love, and wit she bears the bell.
And to recite the substance of her feature
That all may say she is a comely creature,
From head to foot
From head to foot
From head to foot I will unfold aright
The shape of her which is my hearts delight.
First is her hair like threads of golden wyre
Upon her head is set a seemly tire,
Which does protect
Which does protect
Which does protect her crimson cheeks from wind
From Titans heat and Boreas blasts unkind.
Her glistring eyes excel the diamond light,
When I behold her countenance by night,
I do admire
I do admire
I do admire to see her beauteous brow
In whom Diana chastnesse does allow.
The second part,
To the same tune.




HEr rubie lips which does enclose the tongue
From whence rare elegies are sweetly sung,
That may amaze
That may amaze
That may amaze each rural swain to hear
Her Siren songs with voice so shrill and clear.
Her Iuorie neck with golden gems complete,
Her arms and shoulders framed fine and neat,
Her lilly hand
Her lilly hand
Her lilly hand and fingers long and small
With slender wast and person somewhat tall.
And farther to devulge some other parts
Wherein dame nature shows her chiefest arts,
I purpose to
I purpose to
I purpose to stoop down unto the toe,
And so speak of the rest as up I go.
Her pretty foot and nimble dapper heel
Her shaking leg have shown such active skill,
Both Coridon
Both Coridon
Both Coridon and Phillis blush't to see
Her amourous carriage when she bends the knee.
Not only this which nature in her placed,
But Lady virtue has her further graced
In all respects
In all respects
In all respects each creature does her find
To pass the Pelican she is to kind.
So constant in her actions still is she
She may compare with chaste Penelope,
Her mind once fixed
Her mind once fixed
Her mind once fixed it never will remove,
She Will rather die like to the Turtle dove.
Her will to chastity is so applied,
She scorns ambition, lust, and hateful pride,
Whereby she gains
Whereby she gains
Whereby she gains good will of great and small
Strong weak, high low, rich poor, they love her al skill
But since my trembling hand and pen wants
To write her fame complete unto my will,
I here conclude
I here conclude
I here conclude wishing each honest lad
May have so true a choice as I have had.
L. P:

FINIS.
