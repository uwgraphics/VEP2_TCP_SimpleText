The Cuckcoo of the Times.
Since Cuckcoo is but what man's born to, certain
The fault's not in the Woman, but his Fortune:
The Cuckcoo therefore hopes to please your mind,
And says it comprehends even all Mankind.
To the Tune of, The Wandering Jews Chronicle.




TOM Tinkers Wife Joan Ruggles sat,
Under a Hedge doing you know what,
mark that which does ensue;
A Bird upon an Daken Spray,
It was no Chattering Pie, nor Iay,
Sung merrily Cuckoo.
I was as Ages will Record,
In former times a great Earls Bird,
that Lord that could not do;
Who though unfit for Cupids Laws,
Was Stallion to the good old Cause,
Which makes me sing Cuckoo.
Although he could not frisk and Ierk,
He got a thousand Bearns o'th Kirk,
fine werk that he did brew;
Yet he was Cuckold in his Mate,
By Bradshaw and Crumwel in the State,
When England Sung Cuckoo.
You Buxome Dames of Sanguin breed,
That must have Morsels at your need,
take heed what e're you do;
whilst youth bewitch you, old ones watch you
Beware or they will catch you, catch you,
Who hate my Song Cuckoo.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.
The Shopkeeper that trades for gain,
And Merchant who does cross the Main,
great wealth he does pursue;
The one in the shop, though something strange
The other whilst he is at the Change,
May Sing with me Cuckoo.
Soldiers of Fortune and Renown,
Whose valor does their actions crown,
this fate sometimes pursue,
Physicians too that live at ease,
Can find no cure for this Disease,
But Sing with me Cuckoo.
Both rich and poor, both high and low,
All sorts the Cuckoo's Note do know,
Gentry and Commons too,
The Country Lad that goes to Plow,
May find the Antlers on his Brow,
That makes him Sing Cuckoo.
Red Letter men they did design
Both Church and State to undermine,
damned Plots they did pursue;
But thanks to God by happy fate,
Themselves blew up, and not the State,
They Will Sing with me Cuckoo.
Another sort as bad or worse,
Gaze in your face and pick your Purse,
yet they will cry Whore first too;
On others they would lay the blame,
Whilst they are doing of the same,
Yet they may Sing Cuckoo.
Jove has his Eagles in the Skies,
Juno has her Peacock decked with Eyes,
gay Toys, give them their due;
Venus her Doves, Minerva's Foul,
Is the King Harry's Groat-fat'd Owl,
And I the poor Cuckoo.
Bacchus Canary, old Pan the Lark,
Pluto his Ravens that shriek in the dark,
but mark what does ensue;
Of all these Fowls none bears the Bell,
For Sprightly Notes like Philomel,
And I who Sing Cuckoo.
A Lawyer he did throw a Stone,
Quoth he, I hate thy Ugly Tone,
be gone, and then cried Shoo;
Thou break'st the City peace, go pack,
I Will clap a Warrant on thy back,
But still she Sung Cuckoo.
Luna they say is Populus,
And we a Moon, as they to us,
if thus, and it be true,
Why should the Court make Citts the scorn
Since all things here below wears horns.
All Nations Sing Cuckoo.
Neptune is Horned by the Delian Knight,
Who plays at Put with Amphetrite,
each night the Trick they do;
Mars Cuckolds Vulcan Mamon Mars,
Mony's the Nerv's and Horns of Wars,
The Soldier Sings Cuckoo.
A brisk young Lady she took pity,
Approving of her merry Ditty,
'twas witty and 'twas true;
Dwell with me Tell-troth of the Age,
I Will keep thee in a Golden Cage,
Where thou shall Sing Cuckoo.
