The Dying Lovers Complaint.
Daphne laments cause Strephon is unkind,
Wanting his love no comfort he can find,
and missing that which she desires to have,
Poor Daphne sighs her self into the Grave.
Tune of Young Phaon.


I Am quite undone my cruel one
has me forsaken quite,
He is the man, in whom I can
take pleasure and delight.
But he is unkind and now I find
my thread is almost spun,
here I lament in discontent
alas I Am quite undone.
Whilst others sleep I mourn and weep
in tears I ^m almost, drowned,
When absent he is gone from me,
No comfort can be found.
In slumbring dreams methinks he seems
to be full kind to me,
But when I wake this great mistake
brings sorrow certainly.
The second part, To the same tune.
My Golden hair I rent and tear
like one, outrageous mad.
Cupid say I, I thee defy
thou wicked wanton Lad.
A minute then scarce past agest
e're I do him implore,
Cupid say I, thy deity
I ever will adore.
Thus do I pass my days alas
and can no pleasure find,
^ sigh and cry continually
he is cruel and unkind.
Twice in a breath I wish for death
such torments I endure,
(...) he is ^ind I never s'hall fin^
(...) get a cure.
Then down I lie in hopes to dye,
^re him I see again,
But thoughts of him brings life aga^^
and thus prolongs my pain.
Both cured and killed, blood shed and (...)
all in a Moment is,
From death could he again fetch (...)
with one poor smile and kiss,
Thus do I turn I freiz and burn
in a most strange condition,
No Doctors Art can cure my smart.
except he prove Physician.
But hopes of that must be forgot
and I must to the grave.
Come welcome death and stop my breath
that I some rest may have.
