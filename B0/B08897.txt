THE SEA-MENS REMONSTRANCE; CONCERNING The present Engagement between England,
and Holland, etc.
WHen We look upon the Records of the Ages past, to find out the greatest
blessings that God has bestowed on our Native Country, the Isle of England,
we cannot but acknowledge, that next to the Christian Faith, the Union of the
Nation, under the immediate Power and Government, does exceed all former
Presidents: What apprehension the enemies of our Religion have had at our
peaceable conjunction, and with what eye of jealousy the neighbor states did
look upon us and envy our happiness, these latter days can bear record. For
they have not only attempted to violate our freedom and birthrights, and to
offer for a sacrifice our Religion and Liberties in a cruel and bloody War, but
have also endeavored to make us a broken reed, a rock of offense and a
shipwreck unto those who formerly sought unto Us for shelter from the storms:
Now against this high and extreme insolency of our adversaries, which swells
every day to a greater bigness and exulceration, and is to break out
imperiously at their pleasure, we do unanimously declare, in the presence of
God, Angels, and Men, to live and die together, in this present engagement,
according to our Oath and protestation: And as We seek earnestly to the Lord
for a blessing in the behalf of our selves and the whole Nation; so we desire
not to go forth in our own strength but in the power of the most high God; By
which we hope the Gospel of Christ shall be enlarged, the Nation freed from
danger, and the Commonwealth made more great and glorious then any; which, as
it is the end, so shall it be the faithful endeavors, and unfeigned prayers of
us all.
