To the Tune of Let the Solders rejoice.
Licensed according to Order.





LEt the Females attend
To the Lines which are penned,
For here I shall gi -- be a Relation,
Of a young Married Wife,
Who did venture her Life,
For a Soldier, a Soldier, she went from the Nation.
She her Husband did leave,
And did likewise receive
Her Arms, and on Bo -- ard she did enter,
And right valiantly went,
With a Resolution bent
To the Ocean, the Ocean, her Life there to venture.
Yet of all the Ship's Crew
Not a Seaman that knew
They then had a Woe -- man so near 'em;
On the Ocean so deep,
She her Council did keep,
Aye, and therefore, and therefore she never did fear 'em.
She was valiant and bold,
And would not be controlled
By any that da -- re to offend her:
If a Quarrel arose,
She would give them dry Blows,
And the Captain, the Captain did highly comend her.


For he took her to be
Then of no mean Degree,
A Gentleman's So -- n or a 'Squire;
With a hand white and fair,
There was none could compare,
Which the Captain, the Captain did often admire.
On the Irish Shore
Where the Cannons did roar,
With many stout La -- ds she was landed;
There her Life to expose,
She lost Two of her Toes,
And in Battle, in Battle was daily commanded.
Under Grafton she fought,
Like a brave Hero stout,
And made the proud To -- ries retire;
She in Field did appear
With a Heart void of Fear,
And she bravely, she bravely did charge and give Fire.
While the battering Balls,
Did assault the strong Walls
Of Cork, and the swe -- et Trumpets sounded,
She did bravely advance
Where by unhappy Chance,
This young Female, young Female, was fataly wounded,
At the end of the Fray,
Still she languishing lay,
Then over the O -- cean they brought her,
To her own Native Shore,
Now they never knew before,
That a Woman, a Woman, had been in that slaughter.
What she long had concealed,
Now at length she revealed,
That she was a Woe -- man that ventured,
Then to London with care,
She did streightways repair,
But she died, oh! she died ever the City she entered,
When her Parents beheld,
They with Sorrow was filled
For why they did dear -- ly adore her,
In her Grave now she lies,
It Is not watery Eyes,
No nor sighing, nor sighing, that ever can restore her.
Printed for Charles Bates next to the Crown Tavern in West-smith field.
