The Norfolk Gentleman his last Will and Testament: And how he committed the
keeping of his Children to his own brother, who dealt most wickedly with them:
and how God plagued him for it.
To the tune of Rogero.


NOw ponder well you parents dear,
the words which I shall write,
A doleful story you shall hear,
which time has brought to light.
A Gentleman of good account,
in Norfolk lived of late,
Whose wealth and riches did surmount
most men of his estate,
Sore sick he was and like to die,
no help that he could have,
His wife by him as sick did lie,
and both possessed one grave.
No love between these two was lost,
each was to other kind,
In love they lived, in love they did,
and left two Babes behind.
The one a fine and pretty Boy,
not passing three years old.
The next a Girlemore young than he,
and made of beauties mold.
This Father left his little son,
as well it does appear,
When he to perfect age should come,
three hundred pounds a year.
And to his little daughter Jane,
three hundred pounds in Gold,
To be paid down at marriage day,
which might not be contrould;
But if these Children chance to die,
ere they to age should come,
Their Uncle should possess this wealth,
and so the Will did run.
Now Brother said the dying man,
look to my Children dear,
Be good unto my Boy and Girl,
no friends I else have here.
To God and you I do commend
my Children night and day,
A little time be sure we have
within this world to stay.
You must be father and mother both,
and Uncle all in one,
God knows what will become of them,
when we are dead and gone.
With that bespake their mother dear,
O brother mine (quoth she)
You are the man must bring my Babes,
to wealth or misery.
If you do keep them carefully,
then God will you reward,
If otherwise you seem to deal,
your deed God will regard,
With lips as cold as any clay,
she kissed her Children small,
God bless you both my little lambs,
with that the tears did fall.
These speeches then their brother spoke
to this sick couple there,
The keeping of your Children young,
sweet sister do not fear;
God never prosper me nor mine,
or ought else that I have,
If I do wrong your Children small,
when you are laid in grave.
Their Parents being dead and gone,
the children home he takes,
And brings them home unto his house,
and much of them he makes.
He had not kept these pretty Babes,
a tweluemonth and a day:
But for their wealth he did devise,
to make them both away.
He bargained with two Ruffians rude,
that were of furious mood,
That they should take the children young
and slay them in the Wood:
And told his Wife and all the rest,
he did the Children send,
To be brought up in fair London,
with one that was his friend.
The second part,
To the same tune.


AWay then went these pretty Babes,
rejoicing of that tide,
And smiling with a merry mind,
they should on cockhorse ride.
They prate and prattle pleasantly,
as they rode on their way,
To them that should their butchers be,
and work their lives dee^y.
So that the pretty speech they had,
made murderers hearts relent,
And that they took this deed to do,
full sore they did repent:
Yet one of them more hard of heart.
did vow to do his charge,
Because the wretch that hired them,
had paid them very large.
The other would not gree thereto,
so here they fell at strife,
With one another they did fight,
about these Childrens life
And he that was of mildest mood,
did kill the other there,
Within an unfrequented Wood,
whiles Babes did quake for fear.
He took the children by the hand,
when tears stood in their eye,
And bade them come and go with him,
and look they did not cry.
And two long miles he led them thus,
when they for bread complain,
Stay here (quoth he) I Will bring you bread
when I do come again.
Those pretty Babes with hand in hand,
went wandering up and down,
But never more they saw the man,
approaching from the town.
Their pretty lips with black-berries,
were all be smeared and died,
And when they saw the darksome night,
they sat them down and cried.
Thus wandered these two little Babes
till death did end their grief.
In one another arms they died,
as Babes wanting relief.
No burial these pretty Babes
of any man receives,
Till Robin Redbrest painefully,
did cover them with leaves,
And now the heavy wrath of God,
upon their Uncle fell:
Yea fearful fiends did haunt his house
his conscience felt an hell.
His barns were fired, his goods consumed,
his land was barren made,
His cattle died within the fields,
and nothing with him staid,
And in the voyage of Portugal,
two of his sons did die,
And to conclude, himself was brought,
to extreme misery.
He pawned and morgag'd all his land,
ere seven years went about.
And now at length this wicked act,
did by this means come out.
The fellow which did take in hand,
the Children for to kill,
Was for a robery judged to death,
as was Gods blessed will,
Who did confess the very truth,
the which is here expressed,
Their Uncle died, while he for debt,
in prison long did rest.
Al you that be Executors made,
and ouerseeers eke,
Of children that be fatherless,
of Infants mild and meek,
Take you example by the same,
and yield to each their right,
Lest God with such like misery,
your wicked mind require,
FINIS.
