THE EXPLANATION.
To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go we.
I.
OUr Priests in holy Pilgrimage,
Quite through the Land have gone,
Surveying each Religious House
Of Abbot, Friar, and Nun:
The yearly Rent,
And full Extent
Of every one they know;
And in whose hands
Are all our Lands
As ancient Writers show.
II.
Those Places all shall be restored,
As in short time you will hear;
I know the Man has past his Word,
Of which you need not fear:
He did never evade
One Promise made,
Nor failed a Friend in Woe;
But when 'twill be,
Nor I, nor he,
Nor the Devil himself does know.
III.
Religious Men shall hither haste,
Their Zeal shall make 'em run;
The Jesui'ts shall your Wives keep Chaste,
Each Friar Confess his Nun:
The Men shall Shrive,
The Women Sw -- ve
So all shall be forgiven,
Your Daughters Whore,
Then quit their Score,
And make 'em fit for Heaven.
IV.
For Lady Abbess shall appear
An old Flux'd Bawd or Punk,
Has F -- k'd and B -- gger'd Threescore years,
Talked Bawdy, and been Drunk,
Religious Puns
To teach the Nuns
Committed to her Charge;
And mortify
Their Lechery,
As Nature does enlarge.
V.
The Vestals all shall Virgins be
That never went astray,
Have been trained up Religiously
The clean contrary way:
In Julian's Song
For Whoring long,
Though often they have noted bin;
Nature of Force
Will have its Course,
'Twas all but Venial Sin.
VI.
Your Colleges shall be our own,
As Vacancy does fall;
We'll strip each Doctor of his Gown,
The Parsons turn out all:
There Revenues great,
With pleasant Seat,
The Church to us has given,
To sing you Mass,
Confess each Ass,
And make you fit for Heaven.
VII.
Nor will we any longer wait,
After such Notice given;
Nor shall they in the Pulpits prate,
Or teach the way to Heaven:
It Is our Province
You to convince;
Our Arguments shall be,
Without dispute
To make you mute,
Then, Hey Boys, up go we.
VII.
Now, Heretics, consider well
The Game you have to play;
You yet may keep on this side Hell,
If warned by what we say:
But ever your Lands
Shall 'scape our Hands,
Which have been long our due;
We'll Stab, we'll Shoot,
And Damn to boot,
Then, Hey Boys, up go you.
FINIS.
