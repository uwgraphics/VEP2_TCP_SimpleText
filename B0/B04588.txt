A new Sonnet, showing how the Goddess Diane transformed Acteon into the shape
of an Heart.
To the tune of, Rogero.


Diana and her Darlings Dear
went walking on a Day,
Throughout the Woods and waters clear,
for their disport and play:
The leaves aloft were gay and green,
and pleasant to behold,
These Nymphs they walked the Trees between,
under the shadow cold
So long at last they found a place
Of springs and waters clear,
A fairer Bath their never was
found out this thousand year:
Wherein Diana daintily
her self began to bathe,
And all her Virgins fair and pure
themselves did wash and lave.
And as the Nymphs in water stood,
Acteon passed by
As he came running through the Wood
on them he cast his eye,
And eke behold their bodies bare,
then prensently that Live:
And as the Nymphs of him were ware,
with voice aloud they cried,
And closed Diana round about,
to hide her body small
Yet she was highest in the rout,
and seen above them all.
And when Diana did perceive
where Acteon did stand,
A furious look to him she gave,
and took her Bow in hand;
And as she was about to shoot,
Acteon began to run
To bide he thought is was to boot,
his former fights were done:
And as he thought from her to escape.
she brought it so to pass,
^inent she changed his shape,
^^en running as he was.
Each Goddess took Diana's part,
Acteon to transform
To make of him a huge wild Heart,
there they did all determe;
His skin that was so fine and fair,
was made a tawnie red,
His Body overgrowne with hair,
from foot unto the head;
And on his head great horns were set,
most monstrous to behold,
A huger Heart was never met,
nor see upon the Mould;
His ears his eyes, his face full fair,
transformed were full strange,
His hands for feet compelled were
throughout the Wood to range.
Thus was he made a perfect Heart,
and waxed fierce and grim,
His former shapes did clean depart
from every joint and limb:
But still his memory did remain,
although he might not speak,
Nor yet among his friends complain,
his woeful mind to break,
At length he thought for to repair,
home to his dwelling place;
Anon his Hounds of him were ware,
and began to try a pace:
Then Acteon was sore aghast,
his Hounds would him devour,
And from them then he fled full fast,
with all his might and power;
He spared neither Bush nor Brake,
but ran through thick and thin,
With all the swiftness he could make,
in hope to save his skin:
Yet were his hounds so near his tail,
and f^llowed him so fast,
His running might not him avail;
for all his speed and haste.
The second part,
to the same tune.


FOr why, his Hounds would never lin,
till him they overtook,
And then they rent and tore the skin,
and all his body shook:
I am your Master Acteon,
then cried he to his Hounds,
And made to them most rufull moan,
with shrill lamenting sounds.
I have been he that gave you food,
wherein I did delight,
Wherefore suck not your masters blood,
his feiendship to requite:
But those Curres of a cursed kind,
of him had no remorse
Although he was their dearest friend,
they pulled him down by force.
There was no man to take his part,
the story tells plain;
Thus Acteon formed like a Heart,
amongst the Dogs was slain.
Your Hunters all that range the Woods
although you rise up rath.
Beware you come not near the Floods
where Virgins use to bathe.
For if Diana you espy
among her Darlings dear
Your former shape she shall disguise,
and make you horns to wear.
And so I now conclude my Song,
having no more to allege,
If Acteon had right or wrong,
let all fair Virgins judge.
A Lullaby
COme little Babe, come silly Soul,
thy Fathers shame and Mothers grief,
Borne (as I doubt) to all our doles,
and to thy self unpappy chief:
Sing Lullaby, and wrap it warm,
Poor Soul it thinks no creature harm.
Thou little think, and least do know
the cause of this his Mothers moan,
Thou wantst the wit to wayle her woe,
and I my self am all alone:
Why do thou weep, why do thou wail,
And know not now what thou do ail?
Come little wretch, ah silly heart!
mine only joy, what can I more?
If there be any wrong thy smart,
that may thy destiny, deplore;
'Twas I, I say against my will,
I wail the time, but be thou still.
And do thou smile? Oh thy sweet face,
I would thy Dad the same might see,
No doubt but it would purchase grace,
I know it well, for thee and me:
But come to Mother, Babe, and play,
For Father false is fled away.
Sweet Boy, if it thy fortune chance.
thy Father home again to send,
If Death does strike me with his Lance,
yet may thou me commend?
If any ask thy Mothers name,
Tell how by love she purchased blame.
Then will his gentle heart soon yield,
I know him of a noble mind,
Although a Lion in the field,
a Lamb in Town thou shall him find,
Ask blessing Lad, be not afraid,
His sugared lips have me betrayed.
Then may thou joy and be right glad,
although in woe I seem to moan:
Thy Father is no rascal Lad,
a noble Youth of blood and bone;
His glancing look, if he once smile,
Right honest Woman will beguile.
Come little Boy, and rock asleep,
sing Lullaby, and be thou still,
I that can do naught else but weep,
will sit by thee and Lullaby,
God bless my Babe and Lullaby
From this his Fathers quality.
