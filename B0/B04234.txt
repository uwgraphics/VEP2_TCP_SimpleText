Loves Unspeakable Passion: Or, The Youngman's Answer to Tenderhearts of London
City
Beauty over Love does triumph,
causing Lovers to complain;
But it is pity, one so pretty,
should be filled with disdain;
To a pleasant New Playhouse Tune. Or, Tender hearts, etc.




HOw can I conceal my passion,
when I am used in this fashion,
by that little blinking by,
Who does ver me and perpler me,
and my comforts does destroy.
Oh forbear me cruel Cupid,
Thou have made me dull and stupid;
and my senses are quite lost:
Never was no man, by a woman,
^ I am with her beauty wounded,
In my thoughts I am confounded,
would I had never seen her face;
For with desire, I burn like fire,
and she never pitties this my case.
Come and seize me death, and ease me,
Nothing else but she can please me,
my soul I cannot call my own;
She has won me and undone me,
night and day I (...) and groan




For to leave her I endeavor,
Then I fall into a Feavour;
burning with a quenchless fire;
But her beauty says it is duty,
for to languish in desire.
Then I fly into a passion,
And tare my hair in my vexation,
I curse the day when first I see her;
Then my speech falters, my mind alters,
and straight I try she is my dear.
It Is not common for a woman,
For to boast she will undo man,
yet I find she often does;
Oh it is pity one so witty,
shows no favor, knows no truth.
You that are in spoil delighted,
Boasting that your lover's slighted,
think not always thus to reign;
When age oretakes ye, love forsakes ye,
you will be paid for your disdain,
Oh consider whilst you flourish,
That your Lover you should nourish,
not require him with disdain;
For if you frown, you cast him down,
and turns his pleasure into pain.
And his trouble soon grows double,
Oh it is better to be noble,
send me then a gentle smile,
That may ease me, not displease me,
but my sorrows all beguile.
Then will I in heart adore thee,
Like an image stand before thee,
fearing to displease thine eye;
Then come and cherish, or I perish,
like a fainting Lover dye.
Spare my life dear, I entreat thee,
With sweet language I will greet the^
for to ease my mortal pain;
Then for ever, I Will endeavor
to forget thy gross disdain.
