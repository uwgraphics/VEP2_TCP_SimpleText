To the right worshipful Gentlewoman Mistres Susan Saltonstall, wife to the
right worshipful, M. Richard Saltonstall, Alderman of the City of London.
IT being my chance (right Worshipful) to lighten upon certain paternes of
cutworks, and others brought out of foreign countries, which have bin greatly
accepted of by diverse Ladies and Gentlewomen of sundry nations, and
consequently of the common people: this seemed unto me a sufficient instance
and Argument, to bestow likewise some pains for the publishing thereof. But
being in suspense of the dedication: two causes induced me to imbolden my
self to present it unto your acceptance and patronage. First, because that
rare devises and inventions are for the most part more agreeable and gratfuller
accepted, then ordinary and common things, although of great price and value.
Secondly, because these works belong chiefly to Gentlewomen, for to pass
away their time in virtuous exercises. Wherefore to fit and accomodate the
dedication aright to the contents and subject of the book, I thought it not
amiss to offer it unto your Worship, in token of thankfulness for so many
benefits which I have received so bountifully at your hands, assuring my
self moreover, that as these paterns will bring sufficient contentment and
profit to all welwillers that are desirous of this art, so they shall for ever
acknowledge themselves to be beholden chiefly unto you, being the chiefest
occasion of the publishing and setting forth thereof. And therefore upon hope
that you will take these inventions in good part, which in time I am purposed
(if God permit) to increase and augment with more new paternes of works: In
the mean time I pray God give to your Worship, a happy, prosperous, and a
long life, with a full accomplishment of all your virtuous desires.

Your Worships most dutiful servant and Kinseman, Adrian Poyntz*

The Epistle to the Reader.
Having framed a body of the best and rarest manner in true perfection, of
sundry sorts of devises or works, as well for frame works, as other Needle
works: I devised with all diligence and industruous study to satisfy the
gentle minds of virtuous women, by bringing to light things never before as
yet seen, nor committed to print: All which devises are so framed in due
proportion, as taking the^ in order, the one is formed or made by the other,
and so proceeds forward, whereby with more ease they may be sewed and
wrought in cloth, and keeping true account of the threads, maintain the bewty
of the work. And more, who desires to bring the work into a lesser form, let
them make the squares less, and if greater, then enlarge them, and so may you
work in diverse sorts either by stitch, pouncing or pouldering upon the same
as you please. Also it is to be understood, that these squares serve not only
for cut works, but also for all other manner of sewing or stitching: noting
withal, that they are made to keep the work or devise in good order, and
even proportion. And if ye will that the squares be greater, make of two one,
and of four two, and so they will be larger: And in this manner may you proceed
in all.

God prosper your desires.
