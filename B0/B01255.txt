A Proclamation for suspending the time of healing the Disease called, The
Kings Evil, until Easter next.
WHereas the Kings most excellent Majesty, by His Proclamation dated the first
day of July last, did prescribe the times of His healing the Disease called,
The Kings Evil, to be Michaelmas and Easter, or within fourteen days next
before, or next after those Feasts: Nevertheless, His Majesty being new
informed, that he Sickness increasoth in many parts of the Kingdom, and
foreseeing the danger that may redound to His sacred Person, by the confluence
of diseased people at this Michaelmas now approaching, Has thought fit further
to suspend all access to His Court and Presence for Healing, till Easter next,
or fourteen days before or after the same. And does therefore straightly charge
and command all persons whatsoever, hereby to take knowledge of His Majesty's
Royal will and commandment herein. And that none presume until Easter next,
or within fourteen days next before, or next after the said Feast, to resort
to His Majesty's Court or Presence for Healing, under pain of His Majesty's
high displeasure, and to be further punished as shall be meet: His Majesty's
said Proclamation of the first of July last, or any thing therein to the
contrary notwithstanding, which nevertheless in all other the Directions and
Declarations therein expressed, His Majesty wills and commands to be duly
and strictly observed, under the penalties therein mentioned.

Given at Our Court at Oatlands the second day of September, in the fourteenth
year of Our Reign.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1638.
