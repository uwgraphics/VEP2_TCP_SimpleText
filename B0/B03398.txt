The Fairy Queen.
Her invitation to those Elves,
That in the night do sport themselves,
Of them a just Character here,
Deciphered is as't shall appear.
To the tune of, The Spanish Gypsies.


COme follow follow me,
You Fairy Elves that be,
That trip it on the Green,
Come circle me your Queen,
Hand in hand we will dance a round,
For this place is Fairy ground.
Upon the dewy grass,
So nimbly we can pass,
Your young and tender stalk,
Nere bends when we do walk,
Yet in the morn it may be seen,
Where we the night before have been,
When mortals ar at rest,
And snorting in their nest,
Through Key-holes close we slide,
Unheard or unespy'd:
Over Tables stools, and shelves,
We trip it with our Fairy Elves.
And if the house be foul,
Either platter, dish, or bowl,
Up stairs we nimbly creep,
And find the sluts asleep:
There we pinch them arms and thighs,
None does hear, nor none espies.
But if the house be swept,
And all things cleanly kept,
We praise the household Maid,
And surely she is paid;
For it is our use before we go,
To leave a Tester in her shoe.
Upon a Moshrompe head,
Our Table-cloth we spread,
The manchet that we eat,
Is a grain of Rye or wheat:
The pearly drops of dew we drink,
In Acorne cups filled to the brinke.
The brains of Nightingales,
With the unctious dew of Snales,
Between two Nutshels stewed,
Is meat that is easily chewed:
The brains of Wrens, the breasts of Mice
Does make us feasts of wondrous price
The Grasshopper, Gnat, and Fly,
Our Minstrels plays supply,
And with that a while,
We do the time beguile:
And when the Moon does hide her head,
The Gloe-worme lights us to our bed,
Being the Pastimes and other Slights,
Of Will-with-a-wispe, and other mad Sprights.


YOu Airy sprights not a few,
Of Robin-good-fellowes crew,
Let Us our old sports renew,
Until the sky look blew:
That mortal men may know and see,
What cuning, merry, mad blades we be.
Ignis Fatuus first,
Among the Fairies nursed,
By Travelers often cursed,
By putting them to the worst:
But they shall with amazement see,
What cunning, merry, etc.
Full many a joviall spark,
I put beside his mark,
As he walks home in the dark,
Through Forest Grove, or Park;
He by a fained fire may see,
What cunning, etc.
A small deluding light,
Presents it self in sight,
And leads him with delight,
Through uncouth paths all night,
All weary rent, and torn he will see,
What cunning, etc.
It Is called Will with a wispe,
But term it what you list,
It is most manifest
That many men have mist,
Their way thereby, and thus you see,
What cunning, etc.
Old Robin-good-fellow likewise,
In many a strange disguise,
Plays many an enterprise,
To blind the peoples eyes,
In sundry shapes he will let you see,
What cunning, etc.
Your gallants that venture fair,
To steal either horse or Mare,
Them in that shape he will bearse
Through water, earth and mire,
In wet and dirty case they see,
What cunning etc.
Sometimes to them he appears,
A fat Weather, which he that bears,
Were as good to loose his ears,
For with tormenting fears
The burdens vanished then they see,
What cunning, etc.
Sometimes he subtly jeeres,
Night-walking wastcoateeres,
When like a man he appears,
And them to the Constable bears,
Then in Bride-well they feel and see,
What cunning, etc,
Thus Robin and the rest,
Not needful to be expressed,
(In humane feature dressed)
Play many a merry jest;
And Thieves upon the Gallows see,
What cunning, etc.
For when they have lost the game,
Then thus they do exclaim,
The Devil ought me a shame,
And now he has paid the same;
All such as these with shame shall see,
What cunning, etc.
These things and more beside,
Might here be specified,
But let the case be tried,
Our Penman has not ly'd,
For mortals by experience see,
What cuning, merry, mad blades we be.
FINIS.
