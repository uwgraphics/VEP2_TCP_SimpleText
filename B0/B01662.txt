A pleasant new Song between a Seaman, and his Love. SHOWING,
Though at the first in misery his time he spent
He met his love at last, with Joy and sweet content.
The Tune is Robin the Devil.


WHen Sol could cast no light,
but darkened over,
And the dark vayles of night
the Sky does cover:
A River running by
where Ships were Sailing,
A pretty Maid I spied,
weeping and wailing.
I stepped unto her, and said,
sweetheart what grieves thee?
She quickly answer made,
none can relieve me:
My Dear by force, quoth she,
in Wars does wander,
Long absence makes me mourn,
death is Commander.
This seven long years and more
he me affected,
We parted on the Shore
with hearts Contracted:
He promised to turn again,
if God life lent him,
Which makes me sigh and mourn
death has prevent him.
A Man then coming by,
struck her amazed,
Gave her a Token rare,
on which she gazed:
Is my Love come, quoth she,
does he come near me?
But still the Man replied,
be pleased to hear me.
Your Love and I did fight
under one Banner,
Maintaining England's right,
purchasing Honor:
Till he received a blow,
your hopes being ^ur^ed,
There he got his deaths stroke,
not to be Cured.
Witness I can afford,
no Man stood nearer,
I saw him singled out,
here stands the Bearer:
Pressing among the throng,
with Resolution;
His enemies so strong
wrought his confusion.
(...)Dear received a stroke,
and his brain broken,
these words then he spoke,
carry this Token
^o she whom I affect,
and none more dearer,
(...)shing her to respect,
and love the Bearer.
^our Dear in Grave does lie
in sumptuous manner,
Where we will let him lie,
in Beb of Honor:
(...) his Right I am sent,
^our Love to crave it,
his last Testament,
sweet shall I have it.
Mad, like one in despair,
fuming and fretting,
She mourns and tears her hair,
on her breast beating:
My D^steny I may ban,
and all that hears me,
Still crying to the Man,
do not come near me.
This for an answer take,
what ever chances,
I will mourn for his sake,
and mine offenses:
Sad black shall be my weed,
like to my fortune,
^ence it does cut the thread,
and my life shorten.
Like to Phenelephe's joy,
or the sad Queen of Troy,
So she cried out this day,
I am bereft of joy,
And never man again,
shall company bear me,
Still crying with disdain,
Do not come near me.
Of all his former Love,
he me assured,
By all the Powers above,
he me conjured:
Of all his promise made,
when we last parted,
To me he gave his Right,
be not faint-hearted.
His Garments he threw off,
which him disguised,
That when she knew her Love,
Lord how she praised:
Betwixt sad joy and mirth
rose such a passion,
Which caused no great deni^^
unto the Question.
Sweet heart come tell m^
since our first meeting,
How I did Act my part
in counterfeiting?
Neat and brave, Sir,
you might gain Ri^^^
If you could Dol^
as well as Spe^^
Thrice happy be the W(...)
that hither broug^^
More happy be the (...)
on shore did land (...)
Welcome to me, she (...)
then fair Alexander,
Or ever Hero was
unto Leander.
Like to Penelope (...)
to wanton Venus,
My Love, kind heart, to thee
shall be ingenious:
Welcome to me, she said,
then fair Amarillis,
Or ever worthy Guy
was to fair Phillis.
When pastime it was done,
and all things neatly,
With joy they came along,
s^inging this Ditty;
Singing most jovely
till they were weary,
Thou have been long away,
welcome home Deary,
By Cuthbert Birket.
