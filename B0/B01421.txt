AN APOLOGETICALL DECLARATION Of the Conscientious Presbyterians of the
Province of LONDON, and of many thousands of other faithful, and
Covenant-keeping Citizens, and Inhabitants within the said City and Suburbs
thereof.

Wherein their firmness and faithfulness to their first Principles, and to
their Solemn League and Covenant is Conscientiously declared; And the
Covenant Breaking and Apostacy of Others is disclaimed and abhorred before God
and the Whole World.

January, the 24th, 1649.

Ezekiel. 17.15.18.19. Shall they prosper, shall they escape, that do such things?
or shall they break the Covenant, and be delivered?

Seeing they have despised the Oath, by breaking the Covenant (when as, lo,
they had given their hand) and have done all these things.

Therefore, thus says the Lord God, As I live, surely, mine Oath which they
have despised, and my Covenant which they have broken, even it will I
recompense upon their own heads.

Job, 22, 30. The innocent shall deliver the Island; and it shall be preserved
by the pureness of thy hands.

LONDON: Prented in the Year, 1649.

To the Reader.
COurteous Reader, It is prudentially considered and concluded on by the
Subscribers hereof, that (seeing their reverent Ministers Representation, with
subscription of their Names has not taken that happy effect which was
desired, nor stayed the hands of those to whom it was directed) therefore the
publishing of their names that have subscribed to this Apologeticall
Declaration, will in like manner, do but little good, in that respect; And,
therefore, although they are upon record to the honor of the Gospel they are
not, now, published, in regard of the present over-awing Power of the Sword;
but may and shall in due time appear in public with more ample and (we hope)
most satisfactory Demonstration of the just Reasons of this their present
concealment, Vale.

WE the Subscribers of this our Apologeticall Declaration, who desire to
approve our selves sincere Professors of the true Reformed Protestant Religion,
Presbyterian Citizens and Inhabitants of the honorable, and, lately, famous
and renowned City of London, who have cordially adhered unto the Parliament, in
its first and second War against the Kings Forces, for the defense of the true
Protestant Religion, His Majesty's Person, Crown and Dignity, the Rights and
Privileges of both Houses of Parliament, and, in them, the Laws and Liberties
of the Kingdom: Calling to mind our solemn engagements, not only by our
Protestation, May, 5th, 1641. but especially our solemn League and Covenant,
which was so religiously and unanimously sworn unto, with our hands lifted up
to the high and holy God of Heaven, that we would really, sincerely and
constantly, through the grace of God, in our several Callings, and with our
lives and estates, endeavor the preservation of them all; Artic: 1: 2, 3. etc.
And, being in our Consciences persuaded and assured of our indispensible
obligation so to do, because most deeply engaged by our said Covenant, not to
suffer our selves directly or indirectly, by whatsoever combination,
persuasion, or terror, to be divided or withdrawn from that Cause which so much
concerns the glory of God, the good of the Kingdom, and honor of the King:
But, all the days of our lives zealously and constantly to continue therein
against all opposition. Artic. 6. And, whereas, by woeful experience, we are
made very sensible of the dangerous effects of the violation of all our
Covenant-concernments, and of the disappointment of our hopes of reaping the
expected fruits of this defensive war, for which, we the Subscribers, have,
many of us, adventured our lives, and most of us, our estates, in a measure,
beyond our abilities, besides the Common Taxes that have been imposed upon us.
And, though we cannot but with bleeding and trembling hearts complain that our
Cause does in these sad and perilous times in which we live, meet with such
violent Opposition, such mighty Lets and Impediments as we are not able to
suppress and overcome, yet, considering with our selves, that what we cannot
suppress or overcome, we are obliged to reveal and make known. Artic. 6. Being
also moved with fear, lest in this time of imminent danger to all that is dear
unto us, our Silence should be taken for Consent; and so contract upon our
selves the guilt of betraying Religion, King, Parliament, the Laws and
Liberties of this Nation; having also no other way left us to set our
Consciences at liberty from the aforesaid guilt, we might contract by our
sinful silence, in this juncture of time. We do, therefore, with all
sincerity, fidelity, zeal, and humility, before the most just and righteous
Lord of Heaven and earth, make known unto all the three Kingdoms of England,
Scotland and Ireland, to all the Reformed Churches, and unto the whole
Christian World, not only the dis-satisfaction of our Spirits, at the late and
present Transactions of those who have forcibly assumed the Supreme-power unto
their own hands: But also do make this our following most solemn and serious
Apologeticall Declaration for our clearing and justification from allowing or
assenting to the illegal actings of these present times. And that we may also
publish unto the world the grounds of these our most just exceptions and
necessitated complaints herein, we declare, That, not only in general, our
righteous Cause before mentioned is perverted, deserted, apostatized, and
fallen from: by those who most injuriously and falsely reproach us with
Apostacy for not associating with them, and bearing them company in their
unwarrantable ways; But, also, in particular, that it is perverted, and abused
in every part and branch thereof. As first, in point of our Religion, which we
are most deeply engaged by Covenant to preserve and reform in power and
purity; Whereas in our own experience (confirmed by the Parliaments, first
Remonstrance, Exact Collect: page 4.) Religion, in its purity was greatly
endangered, in the Prelates times in the Doctrinall part, by the errors of
Popery and Arminianisme; and in worship, with superstitious Innovations: And,
in our sad apprehension, the Doctrine of the Gospel is, now adays, not only
more endangered through the increase of Popery and Arminianisme, but of most
blasphemous Antiscrip^urisme, Antitrinirarianisme, Antinomianisme,
Socinianisme, and many other such like heterodox opinions, and damnable
Doctrines: But also in point of worship, which, instead of fear of corrupting,
is, now, in great danger of absolute Nulling, by accursed opinions both against
the very being of Ordinances, the set-times and days appointed by God for
their Administration, and even of the Officers and Ministers appointed by Jesus
Christ, for their dispensation. Which does the more sadly affect our hearts,
and enforce this just Declaration and complaint, because of that so eagerly
endeavored unwarrantable Tolerating of them all (except, in that subtle
exception of theirs, of the open practice of Popery and Prelacie) as if it were
that Liberty of Conscience which we have all this while engaged for; But,
rather, against which, We do not only protest, but contrariwise profess and
declare that it was, only a Liberty of Conscience from sin and error, which
we propounded in our Freedom from our former Egyptian Taskmasters the
Prelates.

In the next place, we further declare against the perverting of our Cause, in
relation to the preservation of the Rights and Privileges of Parliament. For,
although we were not able to preserve and defend them, when violated by that
unpattern'd and horrid force upon the House, December: 6 and 7, last, 1648. Yet
we conceive our selves obliged to Declare against it, and against the
imprisoning and secluding so many of the faithfullest Patriots and assertors of
the public interest of the Kingdom; And also against the most insolent
subversion and alteration of the constitution of the Supreme judicatorie of the
Kingdom, consisting of the Kings Personal or Virtuall Presence, Lords and
Commons, without whom (as we have been always taught and informed) no Law can
be enacted or repealed; The confirmation and inviolable settlement of which
happy National constitution, with its preservation, were the grounds of our
Engagements, and no change or alteration of the same: Whereas, now, to the
unexpressible grief of our Souls, we see a most strong and fierce combination
in the General and Armies Counsel of War, and others of their party (set
forth to the view of us all, in that Model of theirs, called, The Agreement of
the People, and presented to that which they call the Parliament, Januarie,
20th, 1648.) utterly to subvert and overthrow the whole frame of our foresaid
Legal Government, and to introduce and enforce upon us a most uncouth,
strange, and headless confused Arbitrary and tyrannical Government of their
own devising, and by a new as headless Representative of their own compacting;
and yet all this while, (even whiles they are most violently endeavoring to
overthrow all our National Fundamental Government, the very traitorous act
for which the Earl of Straford and Can(...) dyed, and which they now lay to
the Kings charge to destroy him) most fallaciously and hypocritically they
protest, and strugle to persuade us (as, in page, 29. of their foresaid,
Agreement of the People) that they are far from any desire or thought, to
assum or exercise a Law-giving (these are their own words) or judicial power
over the Kingdom, or to meddle in any thing, save the fundamental settling of
that power in the most equal or hopeful way (as they pretend) for common
Right and Safety; and this, they say, they humbly tender to us, to consider,
and accept of, if we please; Whereas, alas, we know, and ancient experience
has taught us to know, that a Tyrants or Conquerors, Pray, is an irresistible
Command; And this also is it, we thus justly complain of and declare against.

But, in the third place, in relation to our Engagement by the Sword, and
Covenant to defend and preserve our Liberties and Freedoms (in this our late,
most famous and honorable City of London) according to Law; we are most
heartily sorry for the too just occasion that we have to publish, and reveal
the most evident Perversion of our Cause under this consideration also. For,
whereas, to enjoy a Propriety in our estates, with a Freedom from Pattentes,
Monopolies, Ship Money, and other illegal Impositions and Taxes, the Liberty
of our Persons from unlawful Arrests and Imprisonments, contrary unto Magna
Charta, our freeborn English Spirits were raised (for their Preservation and
defense) most freely and even prodigally to lay out our persons and purses: We
are, now, not only in danger of intolerable slavery instead of Freedom and
liberty, according to Law But, to have our Franchises and Privileges, as
Freemen of this City votes and rent from us. The deep wounding thoughts whereof
do so affect and pierce our hearts, that we cannot any longer forbear
mournfully to complain, and Declare, That, since the 7th of December last, we
are not only deprived of our Freedom and liberty to make choice of such
Common Counsell-men, who have all along approved themselves, to God, the
Parliament, and City, men faithful in their trust; they being, now, made
incapable of being chosen thereunto, because of their honest Activity for the
Personal Treaty; And that, by an Ordinance made after this supposed crime was
acted. And now, as a sad fruit of it, through many Common-Counsell-men most
illegally and forcibly chosen, in part of a Common-Counsell, is passed a
Petition, which at best, shows the framers and promoters thereof, only to
mind Earthly things, not a word of any Religious or Heavenly concernment,
being once mentioned in it; And, it is entitled, The petition of the Commons
of the City of London: Which is not only a foul injury and blemish unto the
truly religious and cordial Commons thereof; but fills us also with fear of
future sore breaches of our Franchises, and City-liberties, if not to the
total subversion of the whole Frame of the well-constituted and long
experienced good Government of one of the most glorious and renowned Cities in
the Christian world. All which most injurious irregularities we cannot chose,
as Citizens, but with ineffable grief of heart, here, Declare and complain of,
being in conscience obliged hereunto, even by the Oath of Freemen; viz: The
Franchises and customs of this City you shall maintain. So that, whereas, we
fought for the defense of our Liberties by Law, that our English Spirits might
not be intimidated or beslaved by the Kings design of bringing in of
Germane-horse: We are, now, so far from seeing any sure Foundations, for our
Liberties and Freedom, according to Law, that we look upon our selves in
exceeding great danger (upon that Common plea of the Army, Necessity) to be
miserably subjected to Martial Law, instead of being ruled by the
Municipall-Law of the Kingdom.

And yet, as if nothing should be wanting to make us completely miserable and
exquisitely to pervert our Cause throughout; When both King and Parliament were
in an hopfull way not only of being reconciled, but of settling the Kingdom
in a way that would have answered, (in some competent measure, for the present)
the expense of our blood and treasure, and our Covenant-engagement also; we are
now not, only disappointed in our hopes thereof: But, his Majesty's Royal
Person (the defense and preservation whereof, though so carefully provided for,
by the many Declarations of the Parliament, the frequent Proclamations in our
streets by the beat of the Drum, at the beginning of these Wars, by our
Protestation May 5th, 1641, and by our Solemn League and Covenant; yet as if
the end of our engaging with the Parliament had been for the ruin of the Kings
person and regal Authority) His Majesty's Person, we say, is not only in
extreme danger, by being exposed unto a Trial without warrant either from the
Word of God, or the Laws of the Land: But also is thereby plunged into such a
nature and condition, as is altogether derogatorie to and inconsistent with the
Kings Honor, which we profess in our Covenant, is the 3d part of our Cause,
for which we engaged. Artic: 6 That the world, therefore, (to whom we appealed,
when we entered into Covenant to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's Person,
and authority, in the preservation and defense of the true Protestant-Religion,
and Liberties of the Kingdom) yea the Lord God himself, Angels and Men, may
bear witness with our Consciences, that we have no thoughts or intentions (nor
ever had) to diminish His Majesty's just power and greatness, and that we the
Subscribers hereof are not Covenant-breakers, but do utterly dislike and
disavow the present proceedings against him, either to the taking away of His
Majesty's Crown, much less his life, the very thought whereof we from our
souls detest and abhor; We do, hereby, most freely faithfully and plainly
discharge our consciences, and do testify our loyalty unto the Kings Majesty
according to the duty of our allegiance, expressed in the foresaid
Protestation, May, 5th, 1641, and the Solemn League and Covenant. And we do,
hereby, further declare, that when we so cordially concurred with the
Parliament at first, in the opposition of the Forces raised by the King
(seduced by evil Counselors) as we propouned the preservation and defense of
our Religion, Parliament, Laws and Liberties: so, also, to preserve, and not to
ruin the Kings Person; but, mainly to remove the wicked from his throne, that
so it might be established in Righteousness to Him and his royal Posterity;
But, we say not to pluck Him out of it, and to bring him to an Arbitrary-tryall
for his life, both in respect of his Judges and their Law

In sum, therefore, we have (in all these most weighty respects) too great
and just cause to be extraordinary sensible, that the bringing of the King
(the Head of the Commonwealth) to a trial for his life, before an arbitrary
and illegal power, warranted by no Law of God or Man, and the most strange,
irregular and unparalled proceedings, and contemptuous carriages toward His
Majesty, The putting down of the House of Lords, and, The restraining of so
many eminent Members of Parliament, by the General Council of Officers in
Arms, against all Laws of God and Man, the known privileges of Parliament, the
liberties of the Subject, and their justification of all these exorbitances, in
print, instead of Repentance and deep humiliation for the same, is but a sad
prologue to the ensuing slavery and ruin of all the free borne Subjects of
this Realm: For, if the Head and most eminent Members of the Common wealth,
legally to be protected from violence and tyranny, by so many Oaths, Covenants
privileges, Laws and Engagements, be thus tyrannically and barbarously,
already, insulted over, and trampled under feet, like dust in the streets, by
an imperious Military-power; We, who are inferior to them in all respects, and
not environed with so many privileges and protections, cannot but most justly
fear and expect far greater insolences and intolerable pressours to be
unmercifully exercised on us by them, when these pillars and foundations are
not only thus shaken, but even quite removed and set by; According to our
Saviors own words. Matthew 10.25. If they have called the master of the house
Beelzebub, how much more will they call them so, that are of his household? In
sad and serious consideration hereof, therefore, we say, again and again, we
cannot possibly keep silence, though it be an evil; nay, because it is so
evil a time: But as professors of the true reformed Protestant Religion, which
teaches no such Doctrines, as these forementioned, and as are, now adays so
unblushingly practiced, in relation to the Kings Majesty, and to the rest of
his freeborn Subjects, without any respect, or least distinction to their
places or qualities; That we may, as much as in us lies, wipe-off that foul
blot and scandalous stain that will (otherwise) inevitably fall upon Religion,
by this most horrid breach of our Covenant, especially in relation to our King;
that professors of the Gospel in other Kingdoms may not also suffer by being
cast out of royal protection, for the sin of some (pretended) professors among
us; And that we our selves (when the approaching Earthquake, which is like to
be in the three Kingdoms by fearful commotions and endless wars, and inevitably
like to attend the intended deposure, or violent death of our Sovereign King,
sadly falls upon us) may not have outward misery, and inward guilt to meet
together without and within us, even our Consciences flying in our faces, for
our (at least seeming) consent unto it, by our sinful silence, But what we may
in the singleness and sincerity of our hearts) wash our hands and clear our
innocence in the sight of God and the whole Christian world: We do not only,
in general, make this our just Apology that we are far from the approving of
the breath of our Covenant in any part or branch of it; But, in particular, in
reference to that of the Kings Person; so clear and innocent that we declare
our Detestation and Souls abhorrency of that most disloyal action; conceiving
it to be such a sin, as Men must create a New Name, for, and God a New Hell or
punishment for it.

And, thus now, having (in the unfeined sincerity of our hearts) witnessed a
good Confession, as in the sight of God, and Men; not from a factious,
seditious, vainglorious, or peevish Spirit of contradiction, or in the least
tinctured vile malignity, or apostacy from the common cause of Religion,
Liberty and peace of the Kingdom; Though we fear not persecution (for
righteosnesse sake in being true to our principles) from those who have power,
now, in their hands: yet, not knowing whether by Gods permissive providence,
Satan may not ^ast some of us into prison for, thus, setting our Consciences at
liberty; We therefore commit our Souls, in this our Well-doing unto God, as
unto a faithful Creator, hyding our selves under the shadow of his wings, till
these calamities be over past, and looking unto Jesus, who has assured us,
That whosoever shall forsake houses or brethren, or sisters, or father or
mother, or wife or children, or lands for his Name and Truths sake, he shall
receive an hundredth fold, and shall inherit everlasting life. We have therefore
hereunto subscribed our Names with our hearts and hands;

FINIS.
