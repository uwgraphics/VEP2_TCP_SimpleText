A ^OOKING GLASS of Mortality.

Not very pleasant at the first view to many men, but yet most necessary,
profitable and commodious for all sorts of people of what estate, dignity, or
calling soever they be.

With an Exhortation to good life annexed: Wherein are treated all such things
at appertain unto a Christian to do, from the beginning of his conversion,
until the end of his perfection.

DEATH TO THE careless youth.
YOu careless youth look well on me,
For as I am, so shall you be:
I am the wight, at length that must
Lay all your glory in the dust:
It Is I, it is I, that gives the fall
To eue^ie one, though near so tall:
No wealth, no strength, nor policy
Can make resistance unto me.
Wherefore let this be still your song,
Dead shall I be, ere it be long.
Death to the gallant dainty Dames.
YE gallant Dames, behold your doom,
To this at length you all must come:
Though near so fine, you are but dust,
Though near so loath, away you must:
I daunt your pride, I pull your plumes,
To stench I turn, your sweet perfumes:
Your Rings, your Chains, your rich array,
Yea life and all ^ take away.
Let this therefore ^^^cke your song,
Dead shall I be, ere it be long.
THE AVTHOR TO the Reader.
Let every man, if he be wife,
Though he be not expressed by name.
With indgement deep, and good advise,
Mark well this Glass: for in the same
A perfect picture painted is,
Of everlasting bale or blis.
Most sure we are, that we must die,
But when, or how, God only knows:
O ten times happy then, say I,
Is he that well his time best owes:
But woe to him ten thousand fold,
Who^ death as prisoner fast does hold.
A LOOKING GLASS OF MORTALITY.
That of necessity all men must die.
THat we must all once die, there is no Athiest so incredulous, nor no fool so
se^celesse, Eccle. 9.5.
but does know and confess the same; being compelled thereunto, not only by
the authority of the holy Scriptures and learned Fathers, but also by daily and
howerly experience. The sentence is given, which cannot be recalled: ^^^n. 3.19.
dust we are and into dust we must needs return again, we all must die, and
sink into the ground like waters, which returns not again: Reg. (...) 145.
Man that is borne of a woman, faith Job, has, but a short time to line, and
that little time also that he has is replenished with manifold miseries, his
days be short, ^^el. 17.3.
and the hour of death is uncertain, the number of his months are set down
which he cannot pass, but when they are complete, there is no remedy but die
he must: Quis est homo qui viuit and non videbit mortem: What man is he that
lives and shall not die? surely not one, for all flesh is but Grass, Psa.
88.49. Esa. 40.
and all our glory but as the Flowers of the field, which to day flourish and
to morrow wither and are cast into the furnace, Mat. ^.^.
when Death comes with his Siclein hand to have in his harvest, he looks
not on the green and flourishing years of young Ganimedes, he regards not
the Purple robes of Senators, nor passes not a straw for Cresus yellow
crowns, Eccl. 88.
he fears not the force of Mars, nor subtility of Mercury: neither Caesar,
nor Alexander, could resist him, neither Solomon nor V lisses beguile him.
Neque salunb^^ impium, neither shall the wickedness of the wicked help him,
but down he must amongst the rest: Grass we are, Romans 5.2^.
and as Grass will he mow us, all have sinned, and for sin we all must die. It
is decreed that all must once die, but woe to him that dies twice, the first
death parts soul and body, Job. 9. ^ors 2.
the second death seperateth both body and soul from God, the first depriueth
us of temporal pleasures, ^poc. 2.
the second bereaueth us of everlasting joys.

Well may we all stand in fear of death: for in what state he finds us, ^ug.
in Epist (...)
in that estate shall we be presented before the tribunal seat of God:
neither shall we when we depart carry any thing with us but our good deeds and
our bad; naked came we into the world, (...).
and naked must we depart again, and when we are dead, there is no difference
at all between one Carcass and another, Amb. inexuner^.
unless perchance the rich man's Corse stink more vilely then the poor man's
does, neither does it make much to the matter, whether we have lived te^ or ten
hundred years, for when our glass is run out, and inevitable death is come,
all is one in effect, Hiero. ad Heliodor.
but that he that has lived longest, shall have the greater burden of sin to
bear and the more to account for: much better is it to live a little while and
virtuously, Seen. 79. Epist.
then a thousand years wickedly: better is one day to a wise and learned man,
then a very long life to him that lives lewdly and follows his sensualities.

But what make I so much a do, to prove so plain a matter by so many
authorities of sacred Scriptures and holy Fathers? the very heathens themselves
that knew not God, do in their writings confess the same; Plato.
ask Plato what he thinks of this life, and he will answer you, Sapientum
vita meditatio est mortis, that is, the life of wise men ought to be a
perpetual meditation of death, which will come, nothing more sure, but when
and how, no man cant tell, Seneca Ep. 72.
ask Seneca his judgment herein, and he will not only confirm that I have
said, but prove it by experience. Certum est (faith he) vitam mortemque per
vices ire and composit a dissolui, and dissolut a componi, omne humanum genus
quodcunque est, quodcunque erit morte damnatum est, etc. Arist. Corruption
(...) est generatio alte^^^ius.
It is certain, that life and death come and go by turns: things made and
compounded are to be dissolved, and being dissolved are to be made again. All
generations of men whatsoever are or shall be condemned to die, and the Cities
that now are builded shall one day decay, and men shall ask, where stood such
a town? And again, Seneca. 25.
Morior nec primus nec vltimus, omnes me antecesserunt, omnes sequente hac
condition intraui, vt exirem. All those that lived before me, are dead and
gone before me, and all that are to come shall follow me. I came into the world
upon that condition, Seneca. 24. Ep.
that I should depart again: And as long as I live I daily die, for some part
of my time does daly shorten, and as my years increase, so does my life
decrease, our Infancy, our childhood, and all our youth, even unto yesterday
is lost, all our time passed is perished, and even this very day we dined with
death. And as old age comes after youth, so death follows old age. Yet
would I not wish thee to live in hope of long life, Seneca. 1. Epi.
for thou know not in what corner death does lie in wait for thee: and
seeing thou know not where he lurketh, it were good for thee to expect him
every hour, and suspect him every where. And if death be to be feared, Seneca
Epi. ^0.
he is always to be feared: for what hour is secure from death? yet to the
end thou may not fear death, be thou always mindful of him: Thus far
Seneca. who though he were a heathen, may set us all to school. O keycold
Catholic! o negligent Christian! how can thou hear this without blushing?
how art thou not confounded to think hereupon? Shall Infidels that know nor
God, teach thee to live like a Christian? shall heathe as that neither hoped
for heaven or feared hell, teach us how to live and die well? what can we say
to this? surely I fear me much, that as they are our schoolemaisters now in
this point, so shall they be our accusers and judges at the latter day: they
expected no reward after this life, yet daily endeavored to live and die well,
and we that believe that there is a most just and upright Judge, that shall
reward the good with everlasting glory, and the bad with perpetual pains,
never or very seldom think on death, but live as if there were no such
^matter.

Heu vi^^^t homines tanquans mors nullu sequatur,
Et velut Infernum fabula vana for^^.
Men live and yet believe not, that death shall over take them:
The pains of hell they fear not, But fables they do make them.

What great commodity comes unto man by continual meditation and memory of
death.
MEmento homo quia puluis es in puluerem reuerteris. Genesis 3.
Remember o man that thou art but dust, and into dust shall thou return
again, nothing so much daunteth the pride of man, as the remembrance of his
base beginning, and miserable ending. If we remember what we were in our
mothers womb, we cannot but blush for shame, If we consider what we are now,
we shall find many causes to weep and lament, and if we die, way well what we
shall shortly be, we should both tremble and quake for fear: Our beginning was
such as with honesty it cannot be named, our present state so full of miseries
as no man can number them, and our passage out of this life so painful and
perilous, as no tongue can tell or pen express the same: men would think
hereupon, Deuteronomy. 3 ^^
O that and prudently foresee and provide for this dreadful hour. Ah God, how
many thousand souls lie now broiling and burning in hell, cursing and banning,
that ever they were borne, and all for want of these considerations, which had
they remembered, they might perhaps have bin happy ^oules and glorious Saints
in heaven.

The memory of death is a most precious preservative against all pestilent
deseases of the soul, and a present remedy for all sickness of sin
whatsoever. The memory of death is the mother of humility, the nurse of all
virtues, the bane of pride, and step dame of al vices. The memory of death
purges all misdemeanour, dissolute and light behavior, and preserves us from
all heinous crimes and enormities whatsoever. Memor are nouissima tua (faith
Solomon) and in aeternum non peccabis. Eccle. 7.
Remember thy last things, and thou shall never sin. As for example, who
could take pride to behold him self in a Glass, or to look upon his strait
and well set legs, or to hear himself commended for his comeliness of
person, if he remembered that: Psalm.
Adhuc pusillum and non erit peccatum, sed in modica fossa computresoenti and
ossa. After a little while sinful man must die, and then he shall be put into
a little hole of the ground, where both flesh and bones shall rot and consume
to nothing. Or who would be delighted to hear himself prattle, or glory in
his ready and pregnant wit, if he did bethink him, that Post hominem vermes,
post vermem foetor, sic in non hominem vertitur omnis homo. Shortly, perhaps to
morrow, perhaps to day his tongue shall falter, his voice decay, his memory
fail him, his wits forsake him, and he of a man become worms meat, and that
which the Magottes shall refuse, shall rot and stink most horribly. Who could
glory of his noble parentage, or brag of worshipful predecessors, if he did
remember that, Post miserum funus and vmbra sumus. Surely if we did with the
eyes of our consideration, look well into their graves, we should find greater
matter of confusion then of glory. And if we did enter some what deeper into
the matter, and way in what estate their poor souls be in hell, we should, I
doubt not, have greater cause to quake and tremble, then to brag and boast of
such ancestors.

Where are now Alexander the great, Antiochus, Herod and other such, whose
prid^ surpassed so far, as they we^^ not ashamed to take on them the title of
gods? yea where are those gods themselves, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mertury,
Bacchus, Venus, luno, and the rest: where are they? their divine flesh and
bones are turned into dirt and dust, Baruch. 3.
and their sacred souls broyling in everlasting fire. Where are now all those
Caesar's and Senators of Rome, who so many years together commanded all the
world, and ruled all the roast? where are now all those heathen kings, that in
ancient times commanded men and beasts, which recreated themselves with the
birds and fowls of the air, which put their trust and confidence in gold and
silver, and never were satisfied in hoording up of riches? Exterminati sunt,
and ad inferos descendunt, and alif loco eorum surrex e^unt. They are
extermined perished and descended into hell, and others are risen i^ their
room. Job.
They passed the^^ days in all kind of dalliance and delights, and in a trise
descende^ into the gulf of everlasting grief, where perpetual torments and
eternal horror does inhabit and remain.

And who would set by worldly mucke and pelf, if h^ remembered these words of
ou^ Savior: Luke. 12.
Thou fool, this nigh^ shall they take thy soul fro^^ thee, and the goods
that tho^^ have gathered together, who^^ shall they be? Or who would no^^ fear
to be clothed in Purple and (...) Velvet, and fare deliciously every day, if he
remembered tha^ poor Lazarus which died (...) famine, Luke. 16.
was by the Angels ca^^ried to heaven, and the rich glutton died and was buried
in ^ell; or thought upon these words of David: Psalm. 49.
The rich men leave their goods to aliens and strangers, their grave must be
their house for ever: Et vsque in eternum non videbunt lumen.

Lo here the last will and testament of worldly wise men, they give their goods
to strangers, Psalm. 48.
which spend them faster then they gathered them, and many times go together by
the cares for the same, the devil has their souls, and the worms their
bodies: o miserable end! o detestable testament! what wise men living would not
wish rather to live and die with Lazarus then with the rich glutton?

What gains the Queens moyles by their great burde^s of silver, plate, and
other treasures wherewith they are loden^ Surely nothing but a galle^ back,
for when they come ^^ the Inn, their treasure is take from them, and they
naked, t^ red and galled, as they be, a^ turned into the stable.

So rich men gain nothin^ by their coffers, crammed wi^ Crowns, and sackes
full of s^^uer, but a conscience pittifu^ galled with many a grieuo^ crime, and
when life is at an en^ they are by their friends strip^ ped to their skin,
and nake^ tired, and galled as they b^ thrust into the stinking stab^ of hell,
where they shall be^ sed worse then Moyles, ^^ Moyles in the stable shall ^^
well dressed and curried, w^ sed with prouender, and ha^ as much water as they
w^ drink: but the worldly r^^ ^en in hell shall find none to ^ttie them, but
millions of di^ls to torment them: they ^all eat and gnaw their own ^esh for
hunger, and if they would give ten thousand ^orlds for one little drop of ^ld
water, Luke. 16.
they shall not have (...).

Well, live a worlding he that will, Moriatur anima mea ^orte Iustorum. God
grant ^e to die the death of Just men, and during life to think continually
thereupon: The memory of death makes us humble, meek, lowly, obedient,
charitable, loving, courteous, and benign, obedient to our superiors, humble
to our betters, lowly to our equals, meek and benign to our inferiors,
subjects and servants, charitable to the poor, loving to our neighbors, ^^
courteous to all sorts of peop^^ as well strangers as acqua^^tance, poor as
rich, foes^^ friends.

The memory of death (...) keth us chaste and continent, ^^tient and peaceable,
watch (...) wise and wary, compunct a^ contrite, it mitigateth all ^^ moderate
affections, and q^^ lifieth all inordinate passions ^ helps all diseases of
the min^^ and heals all sickness of t^^ soul, it turns imperfection into
perfections, and of gr^uous sinners makes glorious Saints. And to conclude,
the that attire themselves by the Glass, and spend their day^ in meditating
hereupon, (...) generations shall call the^ blessed: and in die malae liber ab^
^um Dom^nus a sagitta volan^ indie, a negotio perambulante in tenebr^s: ab
incursu, and daemonio meridiano, Luke. 1. Psalm 40.
In the evil day God shall deliver them from the arrow that flveth by day,
fro^the busy devil that walks by night, from in cursion and from the devil
that walks even at noone day, he that continually expects death, cannot but
live well, and he that lives well must needs die well: he therefore that
desires to live and die well, let him bear well in mind that he is dust, and
into dust he must return again. Although that which is already said concerning
this matter, might suffice any wise man or woman in the world, and cause them
to look to themselves and prepare for their dying day, yet for that I know
many to be of such gross and dull capacity as they cannot perceive, or
conceive any thing, unless it be i^ such order set down, as they may in a
manner grope and feel^^ the fame, I will for their sakes set before their eyes,
the lamentable complaint of one attached by death, long before he looked for
him or imagined him to by so near: wishing all men that read the same, grace
and wisdom, by his example to beware least the like also happen unto them,
which God defend.

This man in the flower o^ his time fell so sick, as both Physicians and all
other his friends thought him but a dead man, and willed him to prepare
himself for God, the which when he heard, it did so ama^^ him, as for a long
time he could not utter one word, his grief was so great, and his fear so
far surpassed al measure: at the last with great abundance of tears, which
like to little streams trickled down his cheeks, he burst forth into these or
the like words following.

Ah cruel death, how have thou intrapped me: how am I entangled in thy snares,
that thought my self far out of thy reach? I imagined that I had yet many
years to live and a long race to run: but alas my Glass is run out, and
my days are vanished like a shadow. Psalm. 5.4. Psalm. 101.
Timor and tremor venerunt super me, and contexerunt me tenebrae. The fear of
death has oppressed me, in the gulf of endless grief am I dre^ched, and the
sorrows of hell have compassed me about, and hemd me in on every side, Psalm.
17.
there is no hope of recovery, no help, no refuge, Psalm^.
no way to escape, but needs must I end my days in deep despair, and most
extreme misery: Psalm. 101.
my youthful days are vanished like smoke, my bones are dry as sticks, my
flesh withered like hay, and my heart parched up, for that I have forgotten to
cate my meat; thus am I suddenly brought to naught, that thought my self no
small man in the view of the world.

Ah cursed world, woe be to me that ever I followed thy vanities; Job. 3.
woe, woe, ten thousand times that ever I knew thee^ Ah God, how happy had I
bi^^ if I had never been borne^^ How happy if I had dyed i^ my mothers womb,
and ber^ carried from her belly to my grave? (...). 41.
O death how grieuo^^ is the remembrance of thee unto a man, whose pleasure and
only felicity is set on worldly vanities, as mine was? I could never abide to
think on thee, but now I am enforced to feel thee to mine inexplicable pain
and remediless grief: I would not hearken to those that gave me good
counsel, but counted them fools, that lived continually looking for death,
persuading my self that I should live Methusalems years. But now alas, though
it be late, I find no fool in the world comparable to me: For Death at
unawares is rushed upon me, he has arested me, ^ound me with insolluble
^ands, and draws me to hell, even as a hangman drawe^th a condemned man to
the gallows; Help, help, help, Father, Mother, Brethren, Sisters, Wife,
Children, Friends, Kinsfolks, help, help me, if ever you do lone me, now
help me: Misereminimei, miserem^ni mes, salt^m vos amic^ mes, Take pity upon
me, take pity upon me, Job. 19.
at least you my especial good friends, take pity upon me, keep me from thi^
^ruell murderer, defend m^ from this terrible Tiger, preserve me from this
ramping and roaring Lion, which bat^ me in his paws: and is rea^ die to tear
me in pee^^^ Alas, alas, will no man help what none? O death spare m^ I pray
thee take my lands an^ let me live, for the love of the Lord whom I serve, lot
^^ alone for a year, for a m^^ neth, for a day, for an h^^ were, give me a
little space^^ repent I beseech thee.

Tut, tut, thou art the child of Death, thou art condemned to die, thy hour is
ended, and thou must die, no parents, no friends, no kindred, no treasure, no
honor, no wit, no policy can prevail or help thee a whit. If thou would
give me this world full of gold for one hours space, I would not take it. And
if all the Kings, Queens and Emperors that are now, or ever were in the world,
should on their knees entreat for the lengthening of thy life one Miserere
while, I would not hear them, but even as I now find thee, so will I present
thee before the tribunal seat of God, wherefore dispatch away.

O most cursed and cruel death! O most bloody and pitilesse butcher. Ah God,
whose mieserie is comparable to mine?

Youth (quoth Death) no words will prevail, thy sobs and sighs, thy
lamentable outcries and pitiful complaints, thy wringing of hands, and
tearing of thine hair do not move me a whit, but forth with will I bring thee
to a place where thou shall feel and prove such things, as neither thine eyes
have seen, nor thy eare^ have hard, nor thy heart can conceive or imagine: thou
had time enough to have seen this hour, had thou bin wise, but had I
wist comes now too late.

Ah cruelll death, whithe^ must I go, alas, whither will thou lead me? to a
land unknown, a la^d of utter darkness, a land of endless misery, I^. 67.
where I shall live deprived of all my worldly pleasures, neither shall any man
living see me again?

But to what end do I stand entreating of him that is past all pity? Better
were it for me to spend the little space that yet remains, in bewayling my
time, which I have most unprofitably spent. O that I had now a sea of brackish
tears to run down my cheeks, for after this hour my tears will never be
meritorious any more. Ah God how have I lost, how have I neglected, how have I
misspent my golden time, in vain and wanton speeches, in banqueting and
chambering, in dancing and dallying, in dicing and carding, in bibbing and
bousing, in sleeping compass, and a thousand other such villains, in which
seeing my solace I have utterly lost my self, and hunting after transitory
pleasures, I have found eternal torments and pains. Alas why did I not while
I might, endeavor so to live as I might not have feared to die, (for sure I am,
that he that lives well can not choose but die well:) why had I not all my life
long made preperation for this journey, in which so many millions of men
perish, as scarce one among ten thousand pass to the end in safety: Oh, oh
most unhappy I, alas, alas, in what danger do I stand, if my footing fail me
now, I perish perpetually: Ah miserable wretch that I am, all this as yet is
but the preface or prologue to the play, all that as yet I feel is but a
shadow or dum show of that which presently must follow, and if the prologue be
so doleful, alas how terrible will the Tragedy it self be? If the very
shadow and fear of death be so horrible as it wholly amazeth me to think
thereupon, oh God what will death it self be? In what sort shall I appear and
stand before the face of that most just and severe judge, whom and in whose
sight I have offended more then a hundred thousand thousand times, and that
most hainously? I was sent into this world to serve my Lord God, my creator
and redeemer, in fasting, praying and the like, but I alas have consumed my
time in doing the quite contrary. In turning fasting into feasting, praying
into prating, virtues into vices and all misdeedes whatsoever, and of all the
days of my life God only knows whether I have spent either one day or hour
in his service to his liking or not.

Alas with what shame and confusion shall I stand before God and his Angels,
when I shall be driueu to give an account of every idle word that I have spoken
in my days, what a reckening am I like to make? Alas I am not able to number
the thousandth part of the mortal crimes that I have committed, what then can
I say for my idle words and thoughts, which in number surmounte the sands of
the Sea?

Ah miserable fool that I am I should have thought of these things before, but
now alas it is too late, woe, woe to me ten thousand times, that ever I
deferred my time of amendment, putting off from day to day, crying with the
Crow, Cras, Cras, so long as now I am like to be the Devils own black bird,
and to be put up in the Cage of hell for evermore.

O false fawning and flattering friends, o cousening and crafty Physicians,
how just cause have I to wish, that I had never known nor seen you? you told
me all was well, and that there was no danger of death at all: Fear nothing
said you, this infirmity is nothing but a little distemperature of some humors,
and therefore thou need not send for the Preacher, or to trouble your self
with thinking on your sins at this time, but when you are well, confess your
sins unto God at leisure, at this time sleep, take your rest and set all
your cares apart you shall soon be whole o^ this malady. O false and mos^
unfaithful friends: friends fa^ I? nay rather most cruel foe^ enemies of my
poor soul, and workers of my everlasting wo^ and misery, for hearkening to
your Siren songs, I have rushed on the rocks of everlasting death, and I
perish while there is none to help: but a^ las, I am well enough served for he
that will not preuen^ death, is worthy to be preueted by him.

All mortal wights of wh^^ sex or degree soever thou b^ remember that thou
must die, and perhaps as soon as my self, for any warrant that thou have to
the contrary; do good to all while thou may, seek to appease the wrath of
God: while you have time, in Hymns, Psalms and Thanksgiving seek to praise,
and please him, and while thou live in this wretched world, live in such sort
as in the hour of death you die not in such confusion and as I do now. I wish
now that I had spent my youth in the wilderness with John Baptist, lived by
^rie bread and water with Mach^rius, prayed with ^mes, until my knees had ^in
as hard as horn, bewailed my sins with Mary Magda^^ne, whose continual tears
had ^^et to furrows or gutters in her face, beaten my self wi^^ an iron
chain thrice a d^^ until the blood ran dow^ to the ground, as Kather^^ of
S^enna did, and done an^ thing else whatsouer, and i^^ might live any longer, I
wou^^ live even like an Angel vp^^ earth, but alas I would n^^ when I might,
and now I ca^ not though I would. Let eu^^ rye one therefore if he be wi^^
beware by my harms, a^^ while years, strength, a^^ time do serve to merit,
e^^ devour to prevent the miserable cares and most perillo^^ perplexities that
you see (...) lapped in. Behold, I stand no^^ in such extremity, as I ma^^
greater account, and wou^^ more rejoice of one Pater ^^ster, or other little
prayer d^uoutly said for me, then (...) innumerable, millions of gold and
precious stones. I have with the prodigal child, spent my golden time, and
wasted all lasciuiously, not thinking what would follow, and now I go a begging
from door to door, craving some spiritual ^^mes, and every one thru^^eth me
from him, saying: Mat. 25.
Ne forte nobis, and tibi non fufficiat. Math. 15.
I would gladly catch some of the crummes that fall from their table, but no
man will give ^^e any, no man has pity of ^^e; and rightly, for why should
any man pity him that would not pity himself? I cared not for my self, why
then should others care for me?

O all you that stand here about me, and are eyewitnesses of my present
miseries, beware, ^e ware by me, and while you are in health, hoord not ^ your
treasurers in earth, but heaven, let poor men's b^ somes be your storehouse
Redeem your sins w^ Almes-deedes, and your i^ quities with pity of the poo^
endeavor by the means of w^ ked Ma^mo^ to make you m^ friends, that in the hour
of de^ they may bring you richly ^ den with merits and g^ works into the
eternal tab^ nacle, and be not excluded shut out for want of g^ without hope
of mercy ^ favor, as ye see me.

Oh, oh, cruel death I^ has pierced my heart, the ho^ of my dissolution is
come, I^ live no longer, my sight^ xeth dim, my senses ^^ my tongue begins
to cl^^ to the roof of my mouth, voice waxes feeble, and in ^eed of speaking,
I begin to ^attle in the throat. Ah tole, go tole my doleful passing ^ell.
Ring out my mournful ^nell. Alas, alas, I must be gone, I must die, I must
die, farewell my faithful friends, and all the things that in this world ^
took delight in; I must now depart and leave you all behind. Adue, Adue for
ever and ever, I shall never see you again. Behold, my legs wax cold as ice,
my hands withered and dry, my nails black, my face wanne, pale, earthly, my
sight dim and ^arke, mine eyes wax hollow and begin to roll in my head, and
more and more I wax loathsome to look on, my heart pants and gaspeth for
breath, but being oppressed by dea^^ it can endure no longer, no^ all my
carnal friends begin ^^ put me in mind of God, an^ will me to call upon Jesus,
an^ to run to him for mercy. A^ las, how can I with confiden^ now call upon
him whom I n^ uer served? how can I hope ^^ mercy at his hands, whom ^ have so
infinitely offended? ^^ ring life I abused his mercy, a^^ therefore must I now
feel h^ justice. O Arsenius, Ar^^nius, how happy and blesse^ were thou, that
had the hour of death always before thine eyes. But woe, and tenn^
thousand times woe to me, th^^ never thought on death^ until I was wounded at
the heart.

Alas, whither shall my poor^ ghost go now? what harbor ^^all my sinful soul
find? ^^ho will receive her? who ^^all be her companion? who ^^al be her guide
in this strange ^^gion by the which she is to ^asse? who will or can help ^^r?
or what is he that dares (...) speak for her, departing as ^^e does? O lord
God of ^ostes, thou art our guide, thou ^^t the way by which I should walk,
thou art the door by which I must enter; be thou ^y refuge, my comfort, and
^efence in this most dreadful ^^oure: thou art the Father of mercy, and God

A SONG IN THE praise of heavenly Jerusalem.
Jerusalem my happy home,
When shall I come to thee?
When shall my sorrows have an end?
Thy joys when shall I see?
O happy harbor of the Saints,
O sweet and pleasant soil:
In thee no sorrow may be found,
No grief, no care, no toil.
In thee no sickness may be seen,
No hurt, no ^ch, no sore:
There is no death, not ugly devil,
There Is life for evermore.
No dampish mist is seen in thee,
No cold, nor darkesome night:
There every soul shines like the Sun,
There God himself gives light.
There lust and luker cannot dwell,
There envy bears no sway:
There is no hunger, hear, nor cold,
But pleasure every way.
There Is Nectar and Ambrosia made,
There Is musk and Ciuet sweet:
There many a fine and dainty drugge
Are trodden under feet.
There Cinnamon, there Sugar grows,
There Nard and Balm abound:
What tongue can tell, or heart conceive
The joys that there are found?
Quite through the streets with silver sound
The flood of life does flow,
Upon whose banks on every side
The wood of life does grow.
There trees do evermore bear fruit
And evermore do spring:
There evermore the Angels sit,
And evermore do sing.
There David stands with harp inhand,
As master of the quire:
Ten thousand times that man were blessed
That might his mufike hear.
Gods praises there are always song,
With harmony most sweet:
Old S^meon and Zachary
Have not their songs to seek.
There Magdalene has left her moan,
And cheerfully does sing
With blessed Saints, whose harmony
In every street does ring.
Jerusalem my happy home,
Would God I were in thee,
Would God my woes were at an end,
Thy joys that I may see.

AN EXHORTAtion to good life.
Of the punishments which the Lord threatens unto such as live a sinful
life. Chap. I.
ONe of the principal means which the Lord has used often times to bridle the
hearts of men, and to draw them unto the obedience of his commandments, has
been to set before their eyes the horrible plagues and punishments, that are
prepared for such persons as be rebels, and transgressors of his law: for
although the hope of the rewards that are promised to the good in the life to
come, may move us very much hereunto, yet are we commonly more moved with
things that be irksome unto us, than with things that be pleasant: even as we
see by daily experience, that we are vexed more with an injury done unto us,
than delighted with any honor: and we are more troubled with sickness, than
comforted with health: and so by the discommoditie of sickness we come to
understand the commodity of health: as by a thing so much the better
perceived, by how much more it is sensibly felt. Now for this cause did the
Lord in times past use this, means more then any other, as it appears most
clearly by the writings of the Prophets, which are every where full of
dreadful saying and threatenings, ^hy the lord ordiarily uses ^reatnings.
wherewith the Lord pretended to put a terror into the hearts of men, and so to
bridle and subdue them under the obedience of his law: and for this end he
commanded the Prophet leremie, Ier. 36.2.
that he should take a white book, and write in the same all the threatenings
and calamities which he had revealed unto him, even from the first day he began
to talk with him, until that present hour: and that he should read the
same in the presence of all the people, to see if peradventure they would be
moved therewith to repentance and to change their former life, to the end that
he might also change the determination of his wrath, which he had purposed to
execute upon them: and the holy Scripture says, That when the Prophet had done
according as he was commanded by Almighty God, and had read all those
threatenings in the presence of the people, and of the Rulers, there arose such
a fear and terror among them, that they were all astonished, and as it were
bestraught of their wits, looking one in another face, for the exceeding great
fear which they had conceived of those words.

This was one of the principal means that Almighty God used with men in the
time of the law written, and so did he also in the time of the law of grace;
in which the holy Apostle says, ^om 1.
that as there is revealed a justice whereby God makes men just, so is there
also revealed an indignation and wrath, wherewith he punishes the unjust. For
which cause Saint John Baptist, the glorious forerunner of our Savior Christ,
was sent with this commission and embassage, to preach unto the world, Matthew.
3. verse 10. luke 3.9.
that the axe was now put to the root of the tree, and that every tree that
brought not forth good fruit should be cut down, and cast into the fire. He
said moreover, that there was another come into the world more mighty then he,
that carried in his hand a fan, to winnow and cleanse therewith his flower, and
that he would put up his corn into his garnard, but the chafe he would burn
in a fire that should never be quenched. This was the preaching and embassage,
which the holy forerunner of our Savior Christ brought into the world, and
so great was the thunder of these words, and the terror which entered into
men's hearts so dreadful, that there ran unto him of all state and conditions
of men, even o^ the very Pharisees and Publicans, yea and soldiers also (which
of all others are woo^ to be most dissolute, and to hau^ least care of their
conscience and each of them for himself demanded particularly of the holy
man, what he should d^ to attain unto salvation, an^ to escape those terrible
threa^nings which he had denounce unto them: so great was the fear they had
conceived ^^ them.

Now this is that (my dear Christian brother) which I do^ at this present in
the behalf (...) Almighty God preach vnt^ thee, although not with su^
feruencie of spirit, and like ho^ lines of life, yet (that which in porteth
more to this case) wit^^ the same truth, and certainty: for so much as the
faith and Gospel that Saint John Baptist preached at that time, was no other,
but this which we preach at this present.

Now if thou be desirous to understand in few words, how great the punishment
is, that Almighty God has threatened in his holy Scriptures to the wicked,
that which may most briefly and most to the purpose be said in this matter,
is this: that like as the reward of the good is an universal good thing, even
so the punishment of the wicked is an universal evil, which comprehends in
it all the evils that are. For the better understanding whereof it is to be
noted, that all the evils of this life are particular evils, and therefore do
not torment all our senses generally, but only one or some of them. As taking
an example of the diseases of our body, The miseries of this life are
particular.
we see that one has a disease in his eyes, another in his ears, one is
sick in his heart, another in his stomach, some other in his head, and so
diverse men are diseased in diverse parts: howbeit in such wise, that none of
all these diseases be generally throughout all the members of the body, but
particular to some one of them. And yet for all this we see what grief only
one of these diseases may put us unto, and how painful a night the sick man
has in any one of these infirmities, yea although it be nothing else but a
little ache in one tooth. Now let us put the case, that there were some one man
sick of such an universal disease, that he had no part of his body, neither
any one joint or sense free from his proper grief and torment, but that at one
time and instant he suffered most exceeding sharp pains in his head, in his
eyes and ears, in his teeth and stomach, in his liver and heart, and to be
short, in all the rest of the members and joints of his body, and that he lay
after this sort stretching himself in his bed, pained with these griefs and
torments, every member of his body having his particular torment, he I say,
that should lie thus pained, and afflicted, how great torment and grief of
mind, think ye, should he sustain? O what thing could any man imagine more
miserable, and more worthy of compassion? Surely if thou sholdest see but a
dog so tormented the street, How the damned are tormented in ^ell.
his very pains wo^ move thee to pity him. No^ this is that (my dear
Christi^^ brother, if any comparison m^^ be made between them) which is
suffered in that cursed hom^ble place of hell, not only (...) the space of one
night, but ^^ uerlastingly, for ever and eue^. For like as the wicked have o^
fended Almighty God with^^ their members and senses, a^^ have made armor of
them ^ to serve sin: even so will h^^ ordain that they shall there ^ all
tormented each one of the with his proper torment: Eyes.
the shall the wanton and lechero^ eyes be tormented with the t^ rible sight of
devils: Ears.
the ear^^ with the confusion of such ho^ rible cries, and lamentations shall
there be heard: Nose.
the no^ with the intolerable stench of that filthy and loathsome place: the
taste, Taste.
with a most ravenous hunger and thirst: the touching, Touching.
and all the members of the body, with extreme cold and fire: the
imagination, Imagination.
shall be tormented by conceiving of griefs present: the memory, Memory.
by calling to mind the pleasures past: the understanding, Understanding.
by considering what benefits are left, and what miseries are to come. This
multitude of punishments the holy Scripture signifies unto us, when it faith,
that in hell there shall be hunger, Mat. 5. Psalm. 10.
thirst, weering, wailing, gnashing of teeth: swords double edged, spirits
created for reuengement, serpents, worms, scorpions, hammers, and wormwood,
water of gall, the spirit of tempest, and other things of like sort. Whereby are
signified unto us, as in a figure, the multitude and dreadful terror of the
most horrible pains and torments, that be in that cursed place, there shall be
like wise darkness, both inward and outward, both of body and soul: far
more obscure then the darkness of Egypt, Exodus 10.
which might be felt even with hands. There shall be fire also, and not as this
fire here that tormenteth a little, and shortly ends, but such a fire as that
place requires, which tormenteth exceedingly, and shall never make an end of
torme^ting. Now if this be true, what greater wonder can there be, than that
they which believe and confess this for truth, should live with such a
strange negligence and carelessness as they do? What travails and pains
would not a man willingly take to escape even one only day, yea one hour, the
very least of all these torments? And wherefore do they not then to escape the
euerlastingnesse of so great pains, and horrible torments, endure so little a
travel, as to follow the exercise of virtue? Surely the consideration of this
matter were able to make a man besides himself, in case he would deeply weigh
it.

And if among so great a number of pains, The damned have no kind of comfort,
or hope of any case, or end of their most horrible torments.
there were any manner of hope of end or release, it would be some kind of
comfort: but alas it is not so, for there the gates are fast shut up from all
expectation of any manner of ease, or hope: in all kind of pains, and
calamities that be in this world, there is always some gappe lying open,
whereby the patient may ^ ceiue some kind of comfo^^ sometimes reason,
sometime the weather, sometimes friends, sometimes the hea^^ that others are
troubled w^ the very same disease, and sometimes at the least the hope of ^
end, may cheer him somewh^ Only in these most horri^^ pains and miseries
that be hell, all the ways are shut up such sort, and all the hauen^^ comfort
so embarred, that miserable sinner cannot he^^ for remedy on any side, neith^^
of heaven, nor of earth, neith^^ of the time past, or present, (...) of the
time to come, neither by any other means. The da^^^ned souls think that all
m^^ are shooting darts at them, (...) that all creatures have con^^^red against
them, and that (...) ^^^y themselves are cruel a^^^nst themselves. To this may
^^^e applied that saying of the ^^ly Prophet David: Psalm. 17.6.
The so^^wes of bill have compassed (...) round about, and the snares ^death
have besieged me. For (...) which side so ever they ^oke, or turn their eyes,
they ^oe continually behold occa^ions of sorrow and grief, and none at all of
any ease, or ^omfort. Mat. 25.10.
The wise Virgins says the Evangelist) that ^loode ready prepared at the
^ates of the bridegroom entered ^^, and the gate was forthwith locked. O
locking everlasting! O enclosure immortal! O gate of all goodness, which shall
never any more be opened again, (...) if he had said more plainly, ^^e gate of
pardon, and mercy, of comfort, of intercession, of hope, of grace, and of all
go^^ nesse is shut up for ever and^ uer. Six days and no more (...) Manna to
be gathered, but seventh day, Exodus 16.
which was the both day, there was none to found, and therefore shall fast for
ever, that has not due time made his provision forehand. The sluggard (sa^^
the wise man) will not till ground for fear of cold, Pro. 20.
(...) therefore shall he beg (...) bread in summer, and no (...) shall give
him to eat, an^^ an other place he faith: He (...) gathers in summer is a
(...) son, and he that gives (...) self to sleeping at that season the
son of confusion. For w^^ confusion can there be great then that which that
misera^ covetous rich man suffer^^ who with a few crumme^^ bread that fell
from his table, ^ight have purchased to him^^^fe abundance of everlasting
^elicitie, and glory in the king^ome of heaven: but because ^e would not give
so small a^ning, he came to such an ex^^eame necessity, that he beg^^d, yea
and shall for ever ^gge, but only the drop ^colde water, and shall never
^taine it: who is not moved ^ith that request of this infor^nate damned
person, who ^ryed: O father Abraham, have ^mpassion upon me, and send La^arus
unto me, that he may ^ppe the tippe of his finger in ^ater, and touch my
tongue, for ^hese horrible flames do tor^e^t me exceedingly. What smal^r
request could there be desi^ then this? he durst not re^uest so much as one
cup of water, ^^either that Laza^^ should put this whole handing the water,
not yet (which more to be wondre^d at) did request so much as th^e w^^^ finger,
but only the tip^^ed that it might touch his to^^ and yet this only would be
granted unto him, wh^^^ by thou may perceive, h^^^ fast the ga^e of all
consolation shut up, and how vniuer^ that interdict and excommu^^ cation is,
which is there laid (...) on the damned, fith this m^^ glutton could not
obtain much as this small request ^^ that where soever the damn^^ persons do
turn their eyes, and^^ which side soever they sire^^ forth their hands, they
shall (...) find any manner of comfort, i^neuer so small, and as he th^^ is in
the sea choked, and almo^^ drowned under the water, not ^inding any stay
wherewith to ^^ttle his foot, stretches forth ^^is hands often times on
eue^^e side in vain, (because all that he graspeth after is thin and liquid
water, which deceives him) even so shall it ^^re with the damned persons, ^^en
they shall be drowned in that deep sea of so many mise^ies, where they shall
strive and struggle always with death, without finding any succor or place of
stay, whereupon they may rest themselves. Now this is one of the greatest
pains wherewith they be tormented in that cursed place. For if these torments
should have their continuance limited but for a certain time, though it were
for a thousand, yea, a hundred thousand millions of years, yet even this would
be some little comfort unto them, for nothing perfectly great in case it hau^
an end, but alas, they have no^ so much as this poor and miserable comfort,
but contra^^ wise, their pains are equal continuance with the eterni^^ of
Almighty God, In hell shall be no end of torment.
and the sting of their misery, with t^ eternity of Gods glory: as lon^ as
Almighty God shall live, (...) long shall they die: and when Almighty God
shall cease t^^ be God, then shall they all^^ cease to be as they are. O
dea^ly life! O immortal death! know not whether I may truly term thee
either life, ^^ death: for if thou be life, wh^^ do thou kill? and if thou
be death, how do thou endure wherefore I will call thee neither the one, nor
the other: for so much as in both of them there is contained some that is good,
as in life there is rest, and in death there is an end (which ^s a great
comfort to the afflicted:) but thou have neither rest nor end: what art thou
the^? Marie, thou art the worst of life, and the worst of death, for of death
thou have the torment without end, and of life thou ^ast the continuance
without any rest. Almighty God has ^poyled both life and death of that good
which they had, and has put in thee, that which ^emained to be a punishment or
the wicked. O bitter com^osition! o unsavory purga^ion of the Lords cup, Psalm.
74.
of the which all the sinners of the ^arth shall drink their part.

Now in this continuance, in his eternity, I would wish that thou (my dear
Christian brother) would fix the eyes o^ thy consideration a little while
and that as the clean beast cheweth her cud, even so tho^ would chew and
weigh the point within thy self with greater deliberation: and to the intent
thou may do it the better, consider a little the pain^ that a sick man
abides in o^cuill night, especially if he (...) vexed with any vcheme^t
grie^^ or sharp disease: mark ho^ often he tumbleth and toss^ in his bed,
what disquietnes^ hehath, how long and tedio^^ one night seems unto hi^ how
duly he counts all th^^ hours of the clock, and ho^^ long he thinks each
of the to be, how he passes the tim^ in wishing for the dawning the day, which
notwithsta^ ding is like to help him very little toward the curing of his
disease. If this then be accounted so great a torment, what a torment shall
that be (trow ye) in that everlasting night in hell, which has no morning, nor
so much as any hope of dawning of the day? O darkness most obscure! o night
everlasting! o night accursed even by the mouth of Almighty God, and of all
his Saints: that one shall wish for light, and shall never see, neither shall
the brightness of the morning arise ^ie more; consider then, what a kind of
torment that shall be, to live euerlasting^y in such a night as this is, ^ing
not in a soft bed, (as ^e sick man does) but in a ^^te burning furnace foming
out such terrible raging flames what shoulders shall be able to abide these
horrible heates? Oh how it makes man even to tremble and quake, only to think
of it! If it seem to us thing intolerable, to have only some part of our feet
standing upon a pan of burning coals for the space of saying one Pater
noster, what shall be (trow ye) to stand body and soul, burning in the mi^
dest of those everlasting h^raging fires in hell, in comparison whereof the
fires of the world are but painted fires! there any wit or judgment this
world? have men th^^ right senses? do they vnde^stand what these words ^^
import? or are they peradventure persuaded, that these ^^ only fables of
Poets? or (...) they think that this appertains unto them, or else that it
was meant only for others? none of all this can they say, for so much as our
faith assures us certainly herein: and our Savior Christ himself, who is
the everlasting truth, cries out in his Gospel, Mat. 24.35 Mar. 13. 31.
saying: Heaven and earth shall fail, but my word shall never fail.

Of this misery there follows an other, as great as it, Section. 3. The
pains of hell continue evermore in one degree.
which is, that the pains are always continuing in one like being, and in one
same degree, without any manner of intermission, or decreasing. All manner of
things that are under the cope of heaven, do move and turn round about with
the same heaven, and do never stand still at one state or being: but are
continually either ascending or desce^ding. The sea and the rivers have their
ebbing and flowing, the times, the ages, and the mutable fortune of men and of
kingdoms, are evermore in continual motion, there is no seue so fervent, that
does not decline; neither grief so sharp but that after it is much augmented,
it does forthwith decrease. To be short, all the tribulations and miseries are
by little and little worn away with time: and as the common saying is, nothing
is sooner dry up then tears, only that pain in hell is always green: only
that fever never decreaseth only that extremity of hea^ knows not what is
either evening or morning. In the time of Noes flood Almight^ God rained forty
days and forty nights continually without ceasing upon the earth; and this
sufficed to drown the whole world, but in that place of torment in hell there
shall rain everlasting spears, and darts of fury upon that cursed land,
without ever ceasing so much as one only moment; and this is so true, that as
(faith a Schoole-man) even the pains which shall be there given for the
smallest sins, shall be likewise everlasting, as well as those pains which be
there prescribed for the greatest and most heinous sins, for infinite
punishment is due unto all sins, because in the estate of damnanation there
is no absolution or discharge of any debt, (for that the time of paying and
satisfying is then past) therefore shall the pain due unto venial sin
continue evermore in one same estate, and shall never cease. Now what torment
can be greater and more to be abhorred, then co^^tinually to suffer after one
like manner without any kind of alteration or change, though ^ meat be never so
delicate yet in case we feed continually thereupon, it will in very short time
be very loathsome unto us: for no meat can be more precious and delicate, then
that Manna was, which almighty God sent to the children of Israel in the
desert, and yet because they did eat continually thereof, it made them to
loathe it, yea, and provoked them to vomit it up again. The way that is al
plain (they say) wearieth more then any other, because always the variety
(yea even in punishments) is a kind of comfort. Tell me then of good
fellowship, if things that be pleasant and sauorie, when they be always after
one manner, are an occasion of lothsomnesse and pain, what kind of lothsomnesse
will that be, which shall be caused by those most horrible pains, and torments
in hell, which do continue everlastingly after one like sort: what will the
damned and cursed creatures think, when they shall there see themselves so
utterly abhorred, and forsaken of Almighty God, that he will not so much as
with the remission of one small sin, mitigate somewhat their torment? so great
shall the fury and rage be which they shall there conceive against him, that
they shall never cease continually to curse and blaspheme his holy name.

Unto all these pains there is also added the pain of that everlasting
consumer, Section. 4. The worm of conscience. Esaias. 66. verse. 24.
which is the worm of conscience, whereof the holy Scripture makes oftentimes
mention, saying: Their worm shall never die: and their fire shall never be
quenched. This worm is a furious raging despite, and a bitter repentance
without any fruit, which the wicked shall have always in hell, by calling to
their remembrance the opportunity and time they had whiles they were in this
world to escape: these most grievous and horrible torments, and how they would
not use the benefit thereof, and therefore when the naiserable sinner sees
himself thus tormented and vexed on every side, and calls to mind how many
days and years he has spent idly in vanities, in pastime, and pleasures,
and how oftentimes he was advertised of this peril, and how little regard he
took thereof. What shall he think? what anguish and sorrow shall there be in
his he art? have thou not read in the Gospel, Luke 13
that there shall be weeping, and wayling and gnashing of teeth. Now these and
others the like shall be the causes of this so great and excessive grief. For
the better understanding hereof, being a matter of so great importance, I will
give thee a like example, let us call to mind the history of Joseph and that
great famine that continued for the space of seven years in Egypt, G^^. 41.
before which famine (as the holy Scripture faith) the abundance of corn in
the other seven years before was so great, that it might be compared with the
sands of the sea and exceeded all measure, but after that these seven years
were ended, there followed other seven years of so great barrenness and
dearth, that even in the first year of the^ all, the people of Egypt came
before king Pharao, crying out and saying: Give us somewhat to eat. The king
sent them to Joseph, who required of them all the money they had, and gave them
for the same corn sufficient for that year: when that was consumed and spent,
they returned the year following unto Joseph, saying, Give us to eat: what,
will thou suffer us to die for hunger in thy preseuce, because we have no more
money to give thee? to whom he answered: deliver unto me al your herds of
cattle, and for the same I will give you corn in exchange, since you have no
more money left. After that they had delivered unto him all their cattle, and
that their provision was also spent, they came again to him the next year,
saying; now thou know my Lord that we have no money, nor cattle to give
thee, and there remains nothing else but only our bodies and lands, how
can thou suffer us to die here for hunger in thy sight, our persons, and
lands, which are only left of all our substance are thine, buy us as slaves for
the king, and give us (if it be thy pleasure) corn to sow the la^d that ^ lie
not untilled, and desolate, wh^ they are al dead that should til and inhabit it.
By this mean came Joseph to buy all the land in Egypt, for every one sold his
possessions by reason of the great famine which they suffered: thi^ is the
history. Now let us take that out of it that serves to out purpose, tell me
then I beseech thee, what a grief was it unto these miserable me^ when the^
remembered themselves of those vi^ plentiful years past, and saw we with how
little money they might have provided corn before hand, yea, and have laid v^
also whereby to enrich the^selue during their lives, how justly might they
lament and reprou^ themselves, saying, o how vnfo^ tunate are we ^ might so
easi^ have provided for this dearth, and would not, if we had not ^in
admonished of this before ^and, then perhaps our neg^gence might have had some
excuse, but being thereof ^duertised so long time before, and seeing with all,
what speed and ^iligence the kings purueyours made to gather together and lay
up all the corn they could get, the which was sufficient to give us to
understand what we ought to have done in that behalf, and yet for all this to
be so slothful, and careless as we were, what ex^use ca^ we have? O how much
worth would that be to us at this present which the^ we despised, and conte^ned!
what riches might ^ee now get with the same ^orne, which we did the^ wilful^y
cast away? But (my good ^rethren) all this is but as a shadow dow compared with
the truth That famine in Egypt endure only for seven years, but thi^ in hell
shall endure everlastingly that found a remedy, though with great difficulty and
charge but for this, there shall never any remedy be found; that might be
redeemed with money an^ cattle, but this can never be redeemed with any manner
of exchange, this punishment cannot be pardoned, this pain cannot be exchanged,
this senten^ cannot be revoked: to conclude, those men of Egypt after that the
seven years we^ended, began to lift up their heads, and to come out of their
misery, but in hell whosoeur^ once enters to be punished shall never know
again what rest and ease means. Now if they then notwithstanding al^ this
were during that time so much afflicted and vexed, in how much worse case shall
he be that shall see himself in hell fire so horribly tormented, and vexed,
and that without all hope of remedy? O if thou knew, and would consider
how every one of them shall there stand tormenting, and renting himself,
weeping, and wayling, and saying, o miserable and unfortunate wretch that I am,
what times, and what oportunities have I suffered to pass in vain; a time
there was, when with one sup of cold water I might have purchased unto my self
a Crown of glory, wherefore did I not look before me? how was I blinded with
things present? how did I let pass those fruitful years of such abundance,
and did not enrich my self? yea if I ha^ been brought up among in sidels and
pagans, and had be lecued that there had been nothing else, but only to be bom^
and die, then might I have ha^ some kind of excuse, and might have said that I
knew not w^^^ was forbidden me, but for s^^ much as I have lived amo^
Christians, and was my so^ one of them, and held in for ^ article of my
belief, that t^ hour should come, when should give upon account after what
order I had spent m^ life: for so much also as it w^^ daily cried out unto me,
by t^ continual preaching and te^ching of religious persons who^
aduertisements many following made preparation in tim^ and labored earnestly
for the p^^uisio^ of their souls health, who^ life also and example was a
greater proof of that which they spoke: for so much I say as I made light of
these examples, and preachings, and persuaded my self very fondly, that heaven
was prepared for me, though I took no pains for ^^ at al, what deserve I that
have thus led my life? O ye infernal suries come and rent me in beeces, and
devour these my bowels, for so have I justly deserved: I have deserved to be
hunger starued for ever, seeing I would not provide for my self, while I had
time: (...) deserve not to reap, because ^^ have not sown, I am wor^hy to be
destitute fith I have not laid up in store. ^^ deserve that now my re^^uest
should be dinied me, ^^th when the poor made request unto me, I refused to ^^
lease them: I have deserved sigh and lament in vain, (...) long as God shall
be God; have deserved that this wor^^ of conscience should gnaw my o^trals for
ever and ever, by rep^senting unto me the little ple^sure which I have enjoyed,
(...) the great felicity which I h^^ lost, and how far greater th^^ was which
I might have gain^^ by forgoing that little which would not forgo. This is the
immortal worm that shall (...) uer die, but shall lie there eue^lastinglie
gnawing at the (...) trailes of the wicked, which one of the most tirrible
pain^ that can possibly be im^gined. Section. 5.


Thou will peradventure b^^ a mazed (good Christian bro^ther) in reading so
many kin^ of pains in hell, as has been ^ere described, and now thou ^rt
persuaded that there can be added unto this no more then has been said, but
surely the mighty of God wants not force to chastise his enmies more and
more, for all the pains that we have hitherto chearsed, as such as do
apper^aine generally to all the damned, but besides these general pains
there be other particular pains, which each one of the damned shall there
suffer in di^uerse sort, according to the quality of his sin, and so
according to this proportion, The proud.
the ^aughtie and proud shall there be a based and brought low to their
confusion, the covetous shall be driven to miserable necessity, The covetous.
The glutton.
the glutton shall rage with continual hunger and thirst, The Lecherous.
the lecherous shall bur^ in the very same flames which they themselves have
enkin^led, and those that have all the life time lived dissolutely an^ hunted
after their pleasu^^ and pastimes, shall live the^ in continual lamentation
an^ sorrow.

Now then if all this shall (...) suredly come to pass, what m^ is he that
seeing all this so certainly with the eyes of ^^ faith, will not turn over
the lease, and begin to provide for himself against that time: who^ is the
judgment of men not become? where be their with where is at the least their
sel^^ love, which seeks euermo^ for his own profit, and is much afraid of
any loss, what? may it be thought that men are be come beasts, that provide
on^^ for the time present and neg^^ct time to come? or have ^^ey peradventure
so dimmed ^^eir eyesight, that they cannot look before them? Hear^en (says
Esaias) o yea deaffe, and ye blind, open your eyes, ^^at you may see: who is
blind but my servant? and who is ^eaffe but ye to whom I have ^nt my
messengers? and who (...) blind but he that suffers ^^mselfe to be sold for
a slave? ^^hou that see so many things will thou not see this? ^^ou that have
thine ears open, ^^ilt thou not give ear here^nto? if thou believe nor ^his,
how art thou a Chri^^ian? and if thou believe it, and do not provide for it,
^ow can thou be thought ^reasonable man? Ari^otle faith, that this is the
difference between an opinion and imagination, that (...) imagination alone is
not suf^^cient to cause a fear, but an ^pinion is: for if I do imagi^^ that a
house may fall upon m^ it is not enough to make me ^fraid, unless I believe or
ha^^ an opinion that it will be so ^^deed: for then it is sufficient make me
afraid: and here comes the fear that mu^theres always have, by reason of
the suspicion they concei^^ that their enemies do lie (...) wait for them. If
then the ^pinion and only suspicion (...) danger, is able to cause the most
valiant and courageous (...) fear, how is it that the ce^taintie and belief
of so man^ and so great terrible miseries which is far more sure then any
opinion or knowledge, do^^ make thee to fear, if thou perceiuest that for this
many years past thou have led a licentious and sinful life, and that at the
last according to present justice thou art condemned to these terrible torments
of hell: I may also probably coni^cture, that there is no other likelihood of
^ame^dme^t of thy life to come the^ thou have showed hitherto after so many
years past: how happens it, that running headlong forwards into so manifest a
danger, thou art nothing at all afraid, especially considering the sinful
state wherein thou liues^, and the horrible ^aines and torments, which do
attend for thee, and the time that thou have lost, and the endless repentance
which thou shall have therefore in the most horrible torments of hell?
assuredly it passes all common sense, to consider that there should be such
wilful gross blindness in men.

Of the Glory of the Blessed Saints in Heaven. Chap. 2.
TO the end there might want nothing to stir up our minds unto virtue, after
the pains which almighty God threatens unto the wicked, he does also set
before us the reward of the good, which is, that glory, and that everlasting
life, which the blessed Saints do enjoy in the kingdom of heaven: whereby he
does very mightily allure us to the love of the same, but what manner of thing
this reward, and what this life is, there is no tongue, neither of Angels nor
yet of men, that is sufficient to express it, howbeit that we^ may have some
kind of savor and knowledge thereof, I intend to rehearse here every word,
what Saint Augustine say th in one of his medetations, speaking of this life. O
life (says he) prepared by almighty God for his friends, a blessed life, a
secure life, a quiet life, a bewtifull life, a clean life, a chaste life, a
holy life, a life that knows no death, a life without sadness, without
labor, without grief, without trouble, without corruption, without fear,
without variety, without alteration, a life replenished with all beauty and
dignity, where there is neither enemy that can offend, nor delight that can
annoy, where love is perfect, and no fear a^ all: where the day is
everlasting, and the spirit of al is one where almighty God is seen face to
face, who is the only meat whereupon they seed^ without any lothsomnesse:
(...) delights me to consider thy brightness, and thy treasure do delight my
longing heart the more I consider thee, the more I am stricken in love with
thee: the great desire I have o^ thee, does wonderfully deligh^ me, and no
less pleasure is it vn^ to me to keep thee in remembrance. O life most happy!
^ kingdom truly blessed wherein there is no death, no^ end, neither yet
succession e^ time, where the day continuing evermore without night, knows
not any mutation: where the victorious conqueror being joined with the
everlasting companies of Angels, and having his head Crowned with a garland of
glory, singing unto almighty God one of the songs of Sio^: O happy, yea and
most happy should my soul be, if when the race of this my pilgrimage is
ended, I might be worthy to see thy glory, thy blessedness, thy beauty, the
walls and gates of thy City, thy streets, thy lodgings, and thy noble
Citizens, and thine omnipotent king in his most glorious Majesty: the stones
of thy walls are precious, thy gates are adorned with bright pearls, thy
streets are of very fine excellent gold, in which there never fail perpetual
praises, thy houses are paued with rich stones, wrought throughout with
Saphires, and covered above with massy gold: where none enters in that is not
clean, neither does does any abide there that is defiled: fair and bewtifull
in thy delights art thou o Jerusalem: none of those things are suffered in
thee, that are suffered here: there is great diversity between thy things,
and the things we do continually see in this miserable life: in thee is never
seen neither darkness nor night, neither yet any change of time, the light
that shines in thee comes neither of la^pes, nor of the moon, nor yet of
the bright glistring stars, but God that proceeds of God, and the light
that comes of light is he that gives clearness unto thee, even the very
king of kings himself keeps continual residence in the midst of thee,
compassed about with his officers, and servants: there do Angels in their order
sing a most sweet, and melodious harmony, there is celebrated a perpetual
solemnity and feast, with every one of them that comes thither after his
departure out of this pilgrima ge, there be the orders of Prophets, there is
the famous company of the Apostles, there is the invincible army of martyrs,
The bless company heaven.
there are the true and perfect religious persons, there are the holy virgins
which have overcome both the pleasure of the world, and the frailty of their
own nature, there are the young men, and young women more ancient in virtue
then in years: there are the sheep, and little lambs, that have escaped from
the wolf, and from the deceiptfull snares of this life, and there do now
keep a perpetual feast each one in his place all alike in joy, though
different in degree; there charity reigns in her full perfection, for unto
them God is all in all, whom they behold without end, in whose love they will
be al continually enflamed, whom they always love and in loving do praise,
and in praising do love, and all their exercises consist in praises, without
weariness, and without travel. O happy were I yea and very happy indeed,
if what time I shall be loosed out of the prison of this wretched body, I
might be thought worthy to hear those songs of that heavenly melody, song in
the praise of the ever lasting king by all the Citizens of that so noble city:
happy were I, and very happy, if I might obtain a room among the chaplains
of that chapel, and wait for my turn to sing praises to my God: if I might
be near to my King, my God, my Lord, and see him in his glory, even as he
promised me, when he said: O father this is my last determinate will, that all
those that thou have given unto me, may be with me, and see the glory which I
had with thee before the world was created: hitherto are the words of Saint
Augustine.

Now tell me (good Christian reader) what a day shall that be, that shall shine
in thy house (if thou lead thy life in the fear of God) when after the course
of this pilgrimage, thou shall pass from death te^ immortality, and in that
passage when others shall begin to fear, thou shall begin to rejoice, and
lift up thy head, because the day of thy deliverance is at hand. Come forth a
little (says Saint Jerome) out of the prison of this body, and when thou art
before the gate of the Tabernacle, set before thine eyes the reward thou hopest
for: tell me, what a day sha^ that be, when the Lord himself with all his
Saints, shall come and meet thee in the way, saying unto thee, Arise, and make
have, o my beloved, my delight, and my turtle-doue, for now the winter is past,
and the tempestuous waters are ceased, and flowers begin to appear in our land.

How great joy shall thy soul then receive, when it shall be at that time
presented before the throne of the most blessed Trinity, by the hands of the
holy Angels? how clearly shall thou understand the value and excellency of
virtue; there the obedient man shall talk of victories, there virtue shall
receive herreward, and the good shall be honored according to their desert:
moreover, what a pleasure will it be unto thee, when thou shall see thy self
to be in that sure haven, when thou shall remember the tempests wherein thou
have been tossed, the straights through which thou hastpassed, and the
dangers which thou have passed, and the dangers of thieves, and pirates, from
who^ thou have escaped this is the place, where they shall sing the song of the
Prophet, which says, Had it not been that the Lord had been my helper, it
could not be but that my soul had gone to hell. And how it has pleased
almighty God, that among such a multitude of damned persons, thou should be
of the number of his elect, and one of those to whom he would grant such
exceeding great felicity, and glory. Besides all this, what a goodly sight
shall it be to behold the feasts, and triumphs, which they daily celebrate
with their new brethren, who having conquered the world, and finished the
course of their pilgrimage, do enter in there to be crowned with them. O what a
joy will it be to see those seats filled up, and that City builded, and the
walls of that noble Jerusalem repaired again: with what cheerful imbracings
shall the whole Court of heaven intertaine them, beholding them when they come
laden with the spoils of the vanquished enemy? There shall those valiant men
and women enter with triumph, which have together with the world, conquered the
weakness of their own frail nature: there shall the innocent virgins enter,
which have suffered martyrdom for Christ's sake, with double triumph over the
flesh, and the world, adorned also with garlands o^ lillies, and roses upon
their heads: there shall also ente^ daily many young men and children, which
have vanquished the tenderness of their young years with discretion and
virtue, and shall receive their reward: o how sweet and sauerie shall the
fruit o^ virtue then be, although for ^ time before, her roots seem very
bitter: sweet is the cold^ evening after the hot sunny day: sweet is the
fountain to the weary traveler: sweet i^ rest and sleep to the tired
servant: but much more sweet i^ it to the Saints in heaven to enjoy peace after
war, security after perils, eternal rest after their pains and travels, for
the^ are the wars at an end, the^ need they no more to go all armed on the
right and on the left side. The children of Israel went forth armed toward
the land of promise, Exodus 13.
but after that the land was conquered, they laid down their spears, and
castaway their armor, forgetting al fear and turmoyle of war: each one
under the shadow of his pauilion and harbor, enjoyed the fruit of their sweet
peace. Now may the eyes sleep there, that have been wearied with continual
watching, 3. Reg. ^.
now may the watching Prophet come down from his standing that did watch and
fix his feet upon the place of the centinell. There is no more fear of
invasion by the terrible armies of the bloody enemy, there is no place for the
subtle crasts of the lurking viper, there cannot arrive the deadly sight of the
venomous Basiliske, neither yet shall the hissing of the ancien^ serpent be
heard there, but only the soft breathing air of the holy Ghost, wherein is
beholden the glory of Almighty God: this is the region of pleasure and place
of security, situated above all the elements, whither the clouds and stormy
winds of the dark^ air cannot come. O wha^ glorious things have been spoken
of thee, o City of God Blessed are they (says holy Tobias) that love thee,
and enjoy thy peace. O my soul praise the Lord, for he has delivered
Jerusalem his City from all her tribulations. Happy shall I be, if the
remnant o^ my posterity might come to see the clearenesse of Jerusalem. Her
gates shall be wrough^ with Saphires and Emeralds, and all the circuit of her
walls shall be built with precious stones: her streets shall be pa^ued with
white and polished ^marble, and in all parts of her territory shall be song
praises. O Joyful country, osweet glory! O blessed company! who shall be so
fortunate and so happy as those that are elected for thee? It seems a
presumption to desire thee, and yet I will not live without the desire of thee:
o ye sons of Adam, o race of men miserably blinded and deceived! o ye
scattered sheep wandering out of the right way, if this be your sheepecote,
whither go ye backward? what mean you? why suffer you such an excellent
benefit to be wilfully lost, for not taking so little pain? If labor and
travel be requisite hereu^^ furely from henceforth I d^ sire that all the
labor and pain of the world were laid upon me: let all sorrows po^^ down
upon me as thick i^ hail, let diseases vex me, l^ tribulations afflict me,
let o^ persecute me, let another d^ quiet me, let all creatures ^ the world
conspire against m^ let me be made a laughing stock to all men, and a ref^^ to
the world: yea, and let m^ life be wholly consumed wi^^ griefs and my years
with we^^ping, and lamentation, so th^^ after this life, I may rest ^^ self in
the day of tribulation^^ and be thought meet to hau^ a place among the blessed
people, which are adorned ao^ beautified with such inestimable glory in the
kingdom (...) heaven.

Now then, o thou foolish lover of this miserable world, go thy way, seek as
long as thou will for honors and promotions, build sumptuous houses and
palaces, purchase lands and possessions, enlarge thy territories and
dominions, yea, and command, if thou will, whole empires and worlds, yet shall
^hou never be so great as the ^east of all the servants of Almighty God: who
shall receive that treasure which this world cannot give, and shall enjoy that
felicity which shall endure for evermore; thou with thy pomp and riches shall
keep company with the rich Glutton, buried in the deep pit of hell: but the
devout spiritual man shall be carried up by the holy Angels with poor Lazarus
into Abr^hams bosom. Luke 13.


Of the benefits which the L^ promises to give in this (...) to such as live
^^ust and g^^ly life. Chap. 3.
Peradventure thou will no^ say, that all these things before rehearsed, be
rewards, punishments that are promis^ only for the life to come, a^ that thou
desire to see som^thing in this present life, because our minds are wont ^^
be much moved with the sig^^ of things present. Well, to ^^tisfie thee herein,
we will like wise give thee here thy han^ full, even of that thou doest^
earnestly desire: for althoug^ the Lord do reserve the best wine, and the most
delicate dishes until the end of the banquet, yet he suffers not his friends
to be utterly desti^ute of meat and drink in this tedious voyage: for he
knows very well that they could not otherwise hold out in their journey: and
therefore when he said unto Abraham: Fear not Abraham, for I am thy defender,
and thy reward shall be exceeding great. By these words he promised two things:
the one for the time present, that was, to be his sauegard and defense in all
such things as might happen in this life: and the other for the time to come:
and that is the reward of glory, which is reserved for the next life. But how
great the first promise is, and ho^ many kinds of benefits, and favors, are
therein included, ^ man is able to understand, b^ only he that has with gre^^
diligence read the holy Scri^tures, wherein no one things more often rehearsed
and ^ forth, then the greatness the favors, benefits, and p^uiledges which
Almighty God promises to his friends in the life. Hearken what Salom^^ faith
in his Trouerbes as to^ching this matter: Blessed that man that finds wisdom
for it is better to have it, th^^ all the treasures of silver an^ gold, be they
never so preciou^ and excellent, and it is mon^ worth then all the riches of
the world, and whatsoever man^ heart is able to desire, is not comparable unto
it. The length of days are at her right hand, and riches, and glory at her
left. ^er ways are pleasant, and her ^ssages are quiet. She is the ^e of life
to al those that have ^^tained her: and he that shall have her in continual
possession ^all be blessed. Keep there^^re, O my son, the laws of ^^mightie
God, and his coun^^ls, for they shall be as life to ^^y soul, and sweetness
to ^^y taste, then shall thou walk ^^fely in thy ways, and thy feet ^all not
find any stumbling ^ockes: if thou sleep, thou ^alt have no cause to fear,
and ^thou take thy rest, thy sleep ^all be quiet.

Now this is (good Christian ^other) the sweetness and ^uietnesse of the way
of the Godly, but the ways of the ^icked are far different, as the holy
Scriptures do ded^ unto us: the paths and (...) of the wicked (faith
Ei^^stieus) are full of bramb^^ and at the end of their iou^^ are prepared for
the^, hell, (...) nesie and pain. Do (...) think it then a good exth^^ to
forsake the ways of mighty God, for the w^^ of the world, since there (...)
great difference between ^ one and the either, not (...) in the end of the way,
but ^ in all the steps of the sam^ what madness can be g^^^ter, then to
choose rather ^^ one torment to gain anot^^ thee^ with one rest to gain (...)
there rest? And that thou^^ more clearly perceive the (...) cellencie of this
lest, and wh^^ a number of benefits are p^sently incident thereunto beseech
thee hearken attentively, what even Almightic God himself has promised by his
Prophet Esaias, to the obseruers of his Law, in a manner in these words, as
diverse interpreters do expound them: when thou shall do (faith he) such and
such things, which I have commanded thee to do, then shall forthwith appear
unto thee, the dawning of the clear day (that is the Sun of justice) which
shall drive away all thine errors and miseries, and then shall thou begin to
enjoy true and perfect salvation, and all thy former sins shall be blotted
out of Gods remembrance, and the glory of the Lord shall compass thee round
about: then shall thou call upon the name of the Lord, and he will surely
hear thee, thou shall call, and he will say, behold I am here present and
ready to grant thee whatsoeue^ thou shall have need of: the in the midst of
the darkness, tribulations and vexations of th^^ life, the light of Gods favor
shall shine upon thee, which shall comfort thee, and thy darkne^^ shall be as
the noone day, (for the Lord will so ordain, that the very calamities, and
withal, eue^ the very falls of thy sins past shall be an occasion unto thee
of thy greater felicity) and he w^ give thee always true peace and quietness
in thy soul, and in the time of famine and dearth he will send thee plenty
and abundance: and thy boner shall be delivered from death, and from the
everlasting fires and thou shall be like a garden of pleasure, and like a
fountain of water that never cease running: of thee will he make a
building, (which lay for many years before desolate) in such sort that it
shall stand steadfastly, and endure with sure foundations from generation to
generations. And if thou shall take pains in sanctifying my Saboths, not in
spending them in leude exercises, nor yet in fulfilling thy own will against
mine, but shall observe withal diligence and care all such things as I have
commanded thee this day, then shall thou take delight in the Lord (whose
delights excel all the delights in the world) and I will lift thee up above
the heights of the earth, that is, unto a most happy state of life, whereunto
all the treasures of fortune or of human nature can not reach. Finally, I
will give thee afterward plenty and abundance of that precious inheritance,
which I have promised unto Jacob thy father which is the felicity of glory:
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. All these in a manner, be the words
of Almighty God by the Prophet Esaias.

Now these are the benefits, which Almighty God has promised to his
servant: and albeit some of them be for the time to come, yet are some of
them to be presently received in this life, as that new light and shining
from heaven, that sacietie and abundance of all good things: and assured
confidence and trust in Almighty God: that divine assistance in all our
prayers and petition: made unto him: that peace and tranquillity of
conscience, that protection and providence of Almighty God, that garden of
delights (which is the verdure and beauty of grace) that fountain which never
wants water, (which is the provision and sufficiency of things.) Thus
heavenly delights do excel all the delights of the world, and that elevation of
spirit, whereunto no strength or power of nature is able to aspire. All these
are the gracious gifts and favors which Almighty God has promised to his
servant in this life. They all are his works of his mercy, effects of his
grace, testimonies of his love, and blessings which he of his fatherly
providence shows toward them, upon every one of which there is so much to
be said, that the breuity of this volume will not suffer me to treat
particularly of every point: but to be short, all these benefits do the godly
enjoy, both in this present life, and in the life to come, and of all these are
the ungodly deprived, both in the one life, and in the other. Whereby thou
may easily perceive, what difference there is between the one son and the
other, seeing the one is so rich, and the other so poor, and needy: for if
thou ponder well all these words before declared, and do likewise consider the
state and conditious both of the good and the wicked, thou shall find, that the
one sort are in the favor of Almighty God, and the other in his displeasure;
the one be his friends, The difference between the state of the good and the
wi^ked.
and the other his enemies; the one be in light, and the other be in darkness;
the one do enjoy the company of Angels, and the other the filthy pleasures and
delights of finne; the one are truly free, and Lords over themselves, and the
other are become bond-slaues unto Satan, and unto their lusts and appetites;
the one are joyful with the witness of a good conscience, and the other
(except they be utterly blinded) are continually bitten with the worm of
conscience evermore gnawing one them; the one in tribulations stand steadfastly
in their proper place, and the other like light chafe are carried up and down
with every blast of wind; the one stand secure and firm with the anchor of
hope, and the other are unstable, and evermore yielding unto the assaults of
fortune: the prayers of the one are acceptable and liking unto God, and the
prayers of the other are abhorred and accursed: the death of the one is quiet,
peaceable, and precious in the sight of God, the death of the other is unquiet,
painful, and troubled with a thousand frights and terrors. To conclude, the
one live like children under the protection and defense of Almighty God, and
sleep sweetly under the shadow of his pastoral providence, and the other
being excluded from this kind of providence, wander abroad like straied sheep
without their shepeheard and master, lying wide open to all the perils,
dangers and assaults of the world. Now then (my dear brother) if a virtuous
life be accompanied with all these benefits, tell me I pray thee of good
fellowship, what is the cause shall withdraw thee, and persuade thee not to
embrace such a precious treasure? what art thou able to allege for excuse of
thy great negligence? to say, that this is not true, it can not be admitted,
for so much as thou see, that all is grounded upon the word of God, and the
testimonies of his holy Scriptures: and to say, Esa. 69.
that these are but small benefits, thou can not, for so much as they do
exceed (as we have before declared) all that man's heart can desire. To say,
that thou art an enemy unto thy self, and that thou dooest not defire these
benefits, this cannot be said, considering that man is even naturally a friend
to himself, and the will of man has ever an eye to his own benefit, which is
the very object, or mark that his desire shoots at: to say that thou have no
understanding or taste of these benefits, it will not serve to discharge thine
offense, for so much as thou have the faith and belief, though thou have not
the taste, for the taste is lost through sin, but not the faith; Faith is a more
cer^aine wie^esse, then ^ll the wit^asses and experiences ^n the world.
and the faith is a witness more certain, more secure and better to be
trusted, then all other experiences, and witnesses in the world: why do thou
not then discredit all other witnesses, with this one assured testimony? why
do thou not rather give credit unto faith, than to thine own opinion and
judgment? O that thou would make a resolute determination to submit thy
self into the hands of Almighty God, and to put thy whole trust assuredly in
him: how soon should thou see all these prophecies fulfilled in thee? then
should thou see the excellency of these divine treasures, then should
thou see how stark blind the lovers of this world are, that seek not after
this high treasure. To be short, then should thou see upon what good ground
our Savior inuiteth us to this kind of life: saying: Come unto me all ye that
travel, Math. 11.
and are laden, and I will refresh you: take my yoke upon you, and you shall
find rest for your souls; for my ^oke is sweet, and my burden is light.
Almighty God is no deceiuer, not false promiser, neither yet is he a great
boaster of such things as he promises, why do thou then shrink back! why
do thou refuse peace and quietness? why do thou despise the gentle
offers and sweet callings of thy pastors? how dare thou despise and banish
away virtue from thee, which has such prerogatives and privileges as these
be, and withal confirmed and signed even with the hand of Almighty God. The
Queen of Saba heard far less things thee^ these of Solomon, ^an. 9.
and yet she traveled from the uttermost parts of the earth to try the truth
of those things wh^^ she had heard, and why do not thou then having such
notable, yea and so certain news of virtue, adventure to take a little pains
to try the truth and sequel thereof? O my dear Christian brother, put thy
trust in Almighty God, and in his word, and commit thy self boldly without all
fear into his arms, and unlace from thy hands triflings knots, that have
hitherto deceived thee, and thou shall find that the deeds of virtue, do
far excel her fame, and that all which is spoken in praise of her is
nothing, in comparison of that which she is in deed.

That a man ought not to defer his repentance and conversion unto God from
day to day, considering that he has so many debts to discharge, by reason of
the offenses committed in his sinful life past. Chap. 4.
NOw then if on the one side there be so many and so great respects that do
bind us to change our sinful life, and on the other side, we have not any
sufficient excuse why we should not make this exchange, I beseech thee tell me,
how long time will thou tarry until thou fully resolve to do it; turn thine
eyes (o my Christian brother) and look back a little upon thy life past, and
consider that at this present of what age soever thou be, it is high time, or
rather the time is well near past to begin to discharge some part of thine old
debts; consider that thou who art a Christian, regenerated in the holy water of
Baptism, who do acknowledge Almighty God for thy father, consider I say,
that all this notwithstanding thou have lived even as loosely, and dissolutely,
as thou had been a mere infidel, that had never any knowledge of Almighty
God: and if thou deny this, then tell me what kind of sin is there that thou
have not committed, what tree is there forbidden, that thou have not beholden
with thine eyes? what green meddow is there in which thou have not (at the
least with desire) feasted thy lecherous lusts? what thing has been set
before thine eyes, that thou have not wantonly desired? what appetite have thou
left unexecuted, notwithstanding that thou did believe in Almighty God, and
that thou were a Christian? what would thou have done more, if thou had
not had any faith at all, if thou had not looked for any other life, if
thou had not feared the dreadful day of judgment? What has all thy
former life been, but a web of sins, a sink of vices, a way full of
brambles and thorns, and a froward disobedience of Almighty God, with whom
thou have hitherto lived, but only with thine appetite, with thy flesh, with
thy pride, and with thy goods, and riches of this transitory world? these have
been thy gods, these have been thine Idols, whom thou have served, whose laws
thou have diligently obeyed: make thine accounts with Almighty God, with his
laws, with his odedience, and peradventure thou shall find that thou have
esteemed him no more then if he had been a God of straw, for it is certain,
that there be many Christians, which believing that there is a God, are induced
to sin with such facility, as though they did believe that there were no God
at al: and do offend no whit less, though they believe that there is a God,
then they would do they believed that there w^^ none at all. What greater
in^ry, what greater despite c^^ there be done, then thus to contemn his
divine majesty. Finally, thou believing all such things, have notwithstanding
so led thy life, as if thou we^^ persuaded that the belief (...) the
Christians were the gre^^ rest fables or lies in the who^ world.

And if the multitude of thy sins past, and the facility thou have used in
committing of them, do not make thee afraid, why do thou not fear at the
least the Majesty and omnipotency of him, against whom thouhast sinned? Life up
thine eyes, and consider the infinite greatness and omnipotency of the Lord,
whom the powers of heaven do adore, before whose Majesty the whole compass
of the wide world lies prostrate, in whose presence all things created are no
more then chasse, carried away with the wind: consider also with thy self, how
unseemly it is, that such a vile worm as thou art, should have audacitie so
many times to offend and provoke the wrath of so great a Majesty.

Consider the wonderful and most terrible severity of his justice, The
terrible severe justice of almighty God against sinners.
and what horrible punishments he has used from time to time in the world,
against sin, and that not only against particular persons but also upon
Cities, Nations, Kingdoms, and Provinces: yea upon the universal world, and
not only in earth, but also in heaven, not only upon s^gers and sinners, but
even upon his own most innoceson, our sweet Savior Ies^^ Christ, when he
took upon him to satisfy for the de^ that they owed. And if the severity was
used upon innocent and green wood, an^ for the sins of others, wha^ then
will he do upon dry an^ withered wood, and against those that are laden with
the^ own sins? Now what thin^ can be thought more unreasonable, then that
such a vil^ wretched weak dwarf a thou, Luke. 13. verse. 43.
should be so saucy and mallaparte, as to mock with so mighty a Lord,
whose hand is so heavy, that in case he should stricke, but even one stroke
upon thee, he would at one blow drive thee down headlong into the deep and
bottomless pit of hell; ^here to be tormented for ever by the devils and his
Angles, without all hope of remedy.

Consider likewise the great patience of this our merciful Lord, The great
patience of Almighty God.
who has expected thy repentance so long, even from the time that thou did
first offend him, and think that if after so great patience, and long tarrying
for thee, thou shall still continue thy lewd and sinful life, abusing thus
his mercy, and not ceassing to provoke him to further indignation and wrath,
he will then bend his bow, and shake his sword, and rain down upon thee,
even very sharp^ arrows of everlasting death.

Consider also the profoun^nesse of his judgments, The profoundnesse of the
deep judgments of almighty God.
when of we read and see daily ^ great wonders: we see ho^^ king Solomon
himself, after be so great wisdom, and afte^ those three thousand parable
and most profound misterie^ uttered by him in his book called Cantica
Canticoru^ was sorsaken of almighty God and fuffered to fall down, 1. Reg. 11.
a^^ adore Idols: we see day^ many stars fall down from heaven to the
earth, with ^^ serable falls, Ato. 2.
and to wallo^ themselves in the dirt, and to cate the meat of swine, which
sat before at Gods table, and were fed with the very brea^ of Angels. If then
the just and righteous for some secret pride, or negligence, or else for some
ingratitude of theirs, be thus justly forsaken of almighty God, after they have
bestowed so many years in his service, what may thou look for, that have
done nothing else all thy life time, but only heaped up sins upon sins,
and have thereby offended Almighty God, most grievously.

Now if thou have lived after ^his sort, were it not reason that thou should
now at the ^ength give over, and cease hea^ing sin upon sin, and debt upon
debt, and begin to pacify the wrath of almighty god, and ^o disburthen thy
sinful soul: were it meet that that time which thou have hitherto given to
the world, to the flesh, and to the devil, should suffice, and that thou
should bestow some little time of that which remains to serve him, (...)
has given unto thee all (...) thou have? were it not a po^^ of wisdom after
so long time and so many great injuries, (...) fear the most terrible iush^ of
Almighty God, who the more patiently he suffere^ sinners, the more does he
(...) terward punish them wi^ greater severity and iustio^ were it not meet
for thee fear thy long continuance many years in sin, and in the
displeasure of almighty God procuring thereby against the such amighty
adversary as^^ is, and provoke him of a merciful loving father, to be com^ a
severe terrible judge and ^ nemy? were it not meet to fear, least that the
force of^uill custom may in continuance of come be turned into nature, and
that thy long vicious usual manner of committing of sin, may make of a vice a
necessity, or little less? why art thou not afraid lest by little and ^litle
thou may cast thy felse down headlong into the deep pit of a reprobate
sense, Romans 1.
wherinto after that a man is once fall, he never makes account of any sin,
be it never so great.

The Patriarch Jacob said unto Laban his father in law: These fourteen years
have I served thee, and looked to thine affairs, now it is time, that I should
look to mine own, and begin to attend unto the affairs of mine own
household. Wherefore if thou have likewise bestowed so many years, in the
service of this world, and of this frail transitory (...) were it not good
reason, the thou should now be^ to make some provision (...) the salvation
of thy soul, (...) son the everlasting life (...) come? There is nothing mo^
short, nor more transa^rie, then the life of a m^^ and therefore providing
carefully as thou do for such things as be necess^^ for this life, which is
so sha^^ why do thou not likew^^ provide somewhat for the^ that is to come,
which s^endure for ever and ever?

The conclusion of all the premises. Chap. 5.
IF now all this be so, beseech thee (o my de^ Christian brother) even for the
bitter passion of Jesus Christ, to remember thy self, and to consider that
thou art a Christian, and that thou beleeuest assuredly for a most undoubted
truth what thy faith instructs: this faith tells thee, thou have a judge
above, that sees all the steps and motions of thy life; and that certainly
there shall a day come, when he will require an account of thee, even of every
idle word: this faith teaches thee, that a man is not altogether at an end
when he dies, but that after this temporal life there remains another
everlasting life, and that the souls dye not with the body, but that while
the body remains in the grave, until the general day of judgment, the
soul shall enter into another new country, and into a new world, where it
shall have such habitation, and company as the faith which it had in this
life. This faith tells thee also, that both the reward of virtue, and the
punishment of vice, is a thing so wonderful, that although the world were full
of books, and all creatures were writers, yet should they all be wearied, and
the world come to an end, before they should end their description, and make a
perfect declaration, what is comprehended in each one of these points. This
faith informs thee also, that the debts, and duties, which we owe unto
Almighty God, are so great, that albeit a man had so many lives, as there be
sands in the sea, yet would they not suffice, if they were all employed in his
service. And this faith like wise tells thee, that virtue is such an
excellent treasure, that all the treasures of the world, and all that man's heart
can desire, Sap. 7.
are not to be compared unto it.

Wherefore if there be so many and great respects that do inuit us unto
virtue, how comes it to pass, that there be so few lovers and followers of
the same? If men be moved with gain and commodity, what greater commodity
can there be, then life everlasting? if with fear of punishment, what
punishment can be greater, then everlasting horrible torments in hell fire,
world without end? if with bonds of debtes, and benefits, what debtes are
greater then thee, which we owe unto Almighty God, as well for that he is
which he is, as also for that which we have received of him? If the fear of
perils do move us, what greater peril can there be then death, the hour
thereof being so uncertain, and the account so strait? If thou be moved with
peace, liberty, quietness of mind, and with a pleasant life (which are
things that all the world desires) it is certain, that all these are found
much better in the life that is governed by virtue and reason, then in that
life, that is tuled by the affections and passions of the mind, for so much as
man is a reasonable creature, and no beast. Howbeit in case thou accountest all
this as not sufficient to move thee thereunto, yet shall it not suffice thee to
consider, that Almighty God so abased him self for thy sake, that he
descended from heaven unto the earth, and became man? and whereas he created
the world in fix days, he bestowed thirty and three years about thy
redemption, yea and was also content for the same to loose his life: Almighty
God dyed, that sin should dye, and yet for all this we do endeavor that
finnes might live in our hearts. Notwithstanding that Almighty God purposed to
take away the life of sin with his own death, What shall I say more?
assuredly of reasons we have showed enough, and enough, if this matter were be
to discussed by reason: for I say this, not only in beholding. Almighty God
him self, but wheresoever we turn our eyes, we shall find that every thing
cries out unto us, and calls upon us to receive this so excellent a
benefit, for there is not a thing created in the world, (if we do well
consider it) but does inuit to the love and service of our Lord and Savior:
in so much that look how many creatures there be in the world, so many
preachers there are, so many books, so many voices, and so many reasons, which
do all call us unto Almighty God.

And how is it possible then, that so many callings as these are, so many
promises, and threatenings, should not suffice to bring us unto him? What might
Almighty God have done more then he has done, or promised more then he has
promifed, or threatened more then he has threatened, to draw us unto him, and
pluck us from sin, and yet all this notwithstanding, how comes it to
pass, that there is so great (I will not say arrogancy, but) be witching of
men, that do believe those things to be certainly true, and yet be not afraid
to continue all the days of their life in sin? yea to go to bed in sin,
and to rise up again in sin, and to embrew them selves in every kind of
sin: and this is done in such sort, so without feeling, so without fear, so
without scruple of mind, and without breaking of one hours sleep as if all that they believed we^ dreams, and old wives tales, and as if all that the
holy evangelists have written, were mere untruths, and stark lies. Tell me
now thou desperare traitor, tell me I say thou firebrand prepared to burn in
those everlasting and revenging horrible fires of hell, what would thou have
done more then thou have done, in case thou had been persuaded that all
were mere lies, which thou have believed: for although I see well, that for
fear of external punishment imposed by the Princes law, thou have somewhat
bridled thine appetites, yet can I not perceive that for any fear of Almighty
God thou have ref^ained thy will in any one thing: neither from carnal
pleasures, nor from taking revenge of thine enemies, nor from backbiting and
slaundering thy neighbors, nor yet from fulfilling thine inordinate and
filthy lusts and desires, in case thine ability served there unto, tell me
thou blind gross buzzard, and worse then frantic fellow, what says thy
worm of conscience unto thee, whiles thou art in such a fond security, and
confidence, continuing in such a careless and dissolve wicked life as thou
do, where is now become the understanding, judgment, and reason, which thou
have of a man? why art thou not afraid of so horrible, so certain, and so
assured perils and dangers: if there were a dish of meat set before thee, and
some man (albeit he were a lier) should say unto thee that there were poison in
that dish, tell me, dare thou once adventure to stretch forth thy hand to
take a taste thereof, though the meat were never so sauery and delicate, and
he never so great a lier that should bear thee thus in hand? If the Prophets,
if the Apostles, if the Evangelists, yea if Almighty God himself do (...)
one unto thee, and say. Take heed miserable man for deal is in that kind of
meat, and death lies lurking in that glintenous morsel, which the devil
has set before thee, how dare thou reach for euer^^ sting death with thy
own hands, and drink thine one damnation: to what use put thou in this
mean while thy wits, thy judgments, and thy discourse, 4. Reg. 4.
and reason, which thou have of a man, where is their light, where is their
force, since that none of them: do bridle thee any whit from thy common use of
vices? O thou wretched and mad careless ca^ise, bewitched by the dinell,
adjudged to everlasting darhenesse, both in ward and outward, and so go on
from one darkness to the other thou are blind to see thy (...) misery,
insensible ^^ v^^^ersland thy perdition, and harder then any adamant to se^le
the ^amer of Gods word. ^a^housand times most miserable thou art, worthier to
be (...) with none other then with those where with thy damnation was
lamented: when it was said: O that thou knew this day the peace, quietness,
and treasures, which Almighty God offers unto thee, and do now lie hidden
from thine eyes: O miseraable is the day of thy nativity, and much more
miserable the day of thy death, for so much as that shall be the beginning of
thy everlasting damnation: Mar. 14.
o how much better had it been for thee never to have bin borne, The wicked
Christians shall be punished in hell more grievously for their wicked lives
more then the infi^els.
if thou shall be damned in the most horvible torme^^ of he fire for ever and
ever? How much better had it been for thee never to have been baptized, if
throughthe abusing thereof by thy wicked life, thy damnation shall be thereby the
greater: for if the light of reason only suffices to make the heathen
Philosophers inexcusable, because they knowing God in some degree, did not
glorify him, nor serve him (as the Apostle says) how much less shall he be
excused, that has received the light of faith, and the water of Baptism, and
does often receive the representation of the Lords body, and every day hears
his word preached, Romans ^1
if he do nothing more then these pagan Philosophers have done?

Now what other thing may we infer of the premises, but briefly to conclude,
that there is none other understanding, none other wisdom, none other
counsel in the world, but that setting aside all the impedime^ts and
combersome dangerous ways of this life, we solow only that true and certain
way, whereby true peace and everlasting life is obtained? hereunto we are
called by reason, by wisdom, by law, by heaven, by earth, by hell, and by
the life, death, justice, and mercy of Almighty God. Hereunto we are also
invited very notably by the holy Ghost, Eccles. 6.
speaking by the mouth of Ecclesiasticus in this wise: My son bearken to
instruction, even from the first years of thy youth, and in thy latter days
thou shall enjoy the sweet fruit of wisdom: approach unto it as one that
ploweth and sows, and with patience expect the fruitful increase which it
shall yield unto thee. The pains that thou shall take, shall be but little,
and the benefits that thou shall quickly enjoy, shall be great. May son
hearken to my words, and neglect not my counsel which I shall give, put thy
feet willinglyinto her fetters, and thy neck into her chains, bow down thy
shoulders and carry her upon thee, and be not displeased with her bonds,
approach near unto her with all thy heart, and follow her ways with all thy
strength, seek for her with all diligence, and she will discover her self
unto thee, and after that thou have found her never forsake her, for by her
shall thou findrest in thy latter days; and that which before seemed
painful, will afterward become pleasant unto thee, and her fetters shall be a
defense of thy strength, and foundation of virtue, and her chain shall be
arobe of glory, for in her is the very beauty of life, and her both are the
very bonds of health Hitherto are the words of E^clesiasticus, whereby thou
may in some degree understand, how great the beauty, the delight, the
liberty, and riches of true wisdom are, which is virtue it felse, and the
knowledge of Almighty God, whereof we do entreat. But is all this be not
sufficient to mollify thy heart, lift up thine eyes, and fix thy mind not
upon the water of the world, which vanish away, but upon the Lord who died
for our sins: there stan death he with his feet nailed fast, looking for thee,
with his arms spread abroad to receive thee, and with his head bowing down to
give thee, as to another prodigal son, new kisses of peace, and atonement:
from thence he calls thee (if thou could here him) with many callings and
cries, hearken therefore (o my Christian brother) and consider this well with
thy self, that if his prayer be not heard, that hearkneth not unto the cries
of the poor, how much less shall he be heard that makes him self deaffe to
such cries as these are. Wherefore now determine with thy self to hearken unto
these cries, and be fully resolved to change thy sinful life, and to live a
new life, and so shall thou at the last possess the joys which never shall
end.
