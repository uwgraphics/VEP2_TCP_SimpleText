Cupid's Masterpiece: OR, Long Wished for Comes at Last: Or, The happy Meeting
of William and Mary.
A pretty Damsel of Sixteen it is said,
Was Courted; but of Love she was afraid:
She slights sweet William (so she called his Name)
He took her first Repulse; then she with shame,
Laments her scornful Folly: Now she Loves,
And languishes with grief, till Cupid moves
Her William once again for to be kind;
Which soon he did perform: Now both are joined
In Love's strict Mutual Bands, and Married,
Let none, though once denied, in Love despair.
Tune of, Caelia's my Foe.




GOd Cupid's unkind
Since my Soul he confined,
For to Love
one does prove
So unconstant in Mind:
He has wounded my heart
With an amorous Dart:
But my Dear
will not hear,
Though I tell him my smart.
Once 'twas he did smile,
Which my Heart did beguile;
But then
all young Men
I did scorn for a while:
But my Mind's altered now,
And by Cupid I vow,
I do with
him to Kiss,
If I could but tell how.
What a madness it is
To refuse proffered Bliss:
It Is a grace
to Embrace,
When kind Love bids us Kiss.
My Desires are too late
And I curse my hard Fate,
Who first did
me forbid.
For to make him my Mate






SWeet William was he
Who at first tempted me:
His Name
I cannot blame,
Though so cruel he be:
But now I do fear,
My Complaints he will not hear,
Though I Am crying,
and dying,
Each Hour in the Year.
But if yet I could guess
Any Hopes of Redress,
I would pray
Night and Day,
For a better Success,
If my Love I make known,
And he should it dis-own,
Then with Grief
past Relief,
I were ever undone,
So sweet is his Voice,
That it makes me rejoice
For to hear;
him I fear,
Will not make me his Choice.
He Is so proper and tall,
And so handsome withal,
That his sight
does delight,
And my Senses enthral.
When my Billy does sing,
He does make the Groves ring;
'Twould invite
to delight,
Each sensible thing:
Though my words are in vain,
Yet till Death I Will remain
His own,
though never known
To be wed by my Swain.
Thus with Sighs she did End:
But kind Love was her Friend.
Now at last,
he made have,
And his Bow he did bend:
He pierced William's Breast,
That he could take no rest;
And Love
did him move,
Which he quickly expressed.
To the Damsel he goes
Who did languish in woes,
And with Arms
full of Charms
He Embraces his Spouse.
He did her take Heart:
For God Cupid by Art,
Did enjoyne me,
and confine me,
Never from you to part.
This made her Heart glad,
Which before was so sad:
They were Married,
and never tarried,
Such Desires they had
Let none then despair,
Though tormented they are:
For be sure,
Love that is pure,
Love's Pleasures shall share.
FINIS.
