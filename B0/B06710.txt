A Worthy Kings Description.
Both Country and City give ear to this ditty,
Whilst that I the praises sing,
And fame his honor out does Ring,
That best deserves to wear the Crown;
For Worth there is none can put him down
And this is no flattering, to describe a worthy King;
His Subjects here their desires explain,
Desiring that he may enjoy his own again.


BRave news there is I understand,
Brought by one that late did land,
Many that heretofore were sad,
Their hearts full merry are, and glad,
And rejoice for his sake,
That amends will us make,
And will please us all as then,
for he that we did lack
is now returning back
For to enjoy his own again.
Fair England will be well content
With the chief of men in government,
When the Churches Champion smiles upon her,
Earths Majesty and Natures honor;
His foes unto him he will draw,
He Is the director of the Law.
And the Nations Rights he will maintain:
these things will appear
before the next new year.
When the King enjoys his own again.
When the Scepter of mercy he does hold,
And true Justice does unfold,
And when he does his own embrace,
There you may see the glass of grace,
And the terror of Treason
Which is but Reason.
The poor man's Cause he will maintain;
no man can this deny,
he is the life of ^^yalty,
When that he enjoys, etc.
His command if Right is without dispute,
Then will his power be absolute:
In him Wisdom is very rife,
And his favor will lengthen life;
His Subjects his charge will be,
And his care for their safety.
This pleasure will true peace maintain,
which we shall prove
his joy to be our love,
When the King, etc.
His wisdom is not to be paralel'd
By all that e're the Scepter held,
'cause it is without all equallity,
We hope no man can this deny:
He is of great renown,
And best deserves the Crown;
For why he hat^ most right to reign,
thus says the Trump of fame
that he deserves the same,
For to enjoy, etc.
If for the same he be appointed,
And he be called the Lords anointed;
Like a King he must be served,
Add be tenderly preserved:
Then he the head must be
Of the public body:
If that his right he does regain,
he will tender of us be
if that we live to see
Him to enjoy, etc.
The Second Part,
To the same Tune.


HE^s a blessing over his people by plate,
And Gods Vicegerent full of grace:
He is no foreign Conqueror,
But our Supreme Governor,
His safety his Counsels cares,
And his health his Subjects prayers:
Whilst that on Earth he does remain,
his pleasure is his Peers.
that great Jehovah fears,
And to enjoy his own again.
And for to cheer his Subjects sadness,
His content will be their gladness,
His presence must Reverenced be,
According to his high degree;
His person must not be scorned,
But his civil Court adorned,
When in fair England he does reign,
all men shall be free,
and set at liberty,
When the King, etc.
What righfull thing by him is said,
Ought not for to be disobeyed;
One thing cannot be denied.
That his wants must be supplied,
Nor his place unregarded,
But Royally Rewarded,
And richly his state maintain:
then let our prayers be
these happy days to see.
That the King may enjoy, etc.
Although a God he cannot be,
He Is more then an ordinary man we see,
We do hope he is so divine,
That from the right he will not decline.
Nor yet will he delay
Gods laws to obey,
And all men's Rights for to maintain,
which suddenly will be,
when that men do see
That the King, etc.
I now crave pardon for this bold thing,
For describing of a worthy King,
And heartily for him will pray
Unto the Lord both night and day,
And under Heaven him commend,
That the Lord will him defend,
That he in this Land long time may Reign,
these blessings then will be
who ever lives to see
The King etc.
Then shall London Conduits run with Wine,
With melodious noise of Music fine;
Then Bells shall Ring, and Bone fires burn,
For joy of his gracious return,
From sorrow we
Hope to be free,
From Tyranny and slavish Pain,
then let us all rejoice
both with heart and voice,
When the King e^joys his own again.
FINIS.
