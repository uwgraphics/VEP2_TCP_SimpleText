A Friends advice: In an excellent Ditty, concerning the variable changes in
this World.
To a pleasant new tune*




What if a day or a month, or a year,
crown thy desires with a thousand wished co^tentings
Cannot the chance of a night or an hour,
Cross thy delights with as many sad tormentings;
Fortunes in their fairest birth,
Are but blossoms dying,
Wanton pleasures, doting mirth,
Are but shadows flying:
All your toys are but toys,
Iole thoughts deceiving;
None has power of an hour,
In our lives bereauing.
What if a smile, or a beck, or a look,
Feed thy fond thoughts with many a sweet co^ceiuing
May not that smile, or that beck or that look,
Tell thee as well they are but vain deceiuings;
Why should beauty be so proud,
In things of no surmounting;
All her wealth is but shroud,
Of a rich accounting:
Then in this repose no bliss,
Which is so vain and idle:
Beauties flowers have their hours
Time does hold the bridle.
What if the world with assures of her wealth,
Raise thy degree to a place of high advancing;
May not the World by a check of that wealth,
Put thee again so as low despised chancing;
Whilst the Sun of wealth does shine,
Thou shall have friends plenty:
But come waitt, then they repine,
Not one abides of ^^^enty:
Wealth and Friends holds and ends,
As your fortunes rise and fall,
Up and down, rise and frown,
Certain is no state at all,
What if a grief, or a strain, or a fit,
Pinch thee with pain, or the feeling pangs of sickness
Does not that gripe, or that strain, or that fit,
Show thee the form of thine own crew perfect liknes
Health is but a glimpse of joy,
Subject to all changes:
Mirth is but a silly ^oy,
Which mishap estranges.
Tell me than, silly Man,
Why art thou so weak of wit,
As to be in teopardy,
When thou may in quiet sit;
Then if all this have deelar'd thine amiss,
Take this from me for a gentle friendly warning,
If thou refuse, and good counsel abuse,
Thou may hereafter dearly buy thy learning:
All is hazard that we have.
There is nothing bideing,
Days of pleasure are like streams,
Through fair Medows gliding,
Wealth or woe, time does go,
There is no returning,
Secret Faces guide our states,
Both in mirth and m^ (...)
The Second Part.
To the same tune.




MAn's but a blast, or a smoke, or a clowd,
D^^^t in athought, or a moment is dispersed:
Life's but a span, or a tale, or a word,
That in a trice, or sudden is rehearsed:
Hopes are changed, and thoughts are crossed,
Will nor skill prevails,
Though we laugh and live at ease,
Change of thoughts assayleth,
Though a while Fortune smile,
And her comforts crowns,
Yet at length fail her strength:
And in fine she frowneth.
Thus are the joys of a year in an hour,
And of a month, in a moment quite expired.
And in the night with the word of a noise,
Crossed by the day, of an ease your hearts desired:
Fairest blossoms soonest fade,
Withered foul and rotten*
And throvgh grief our greatest joys
Quickly are forgotten:
Seek not then (mortal men)
Earthly fleeting pleasure
But with pain strive to gain
Heavenly lasting treasure,
Earth to the World, as a Man the Earth;
Has but a point, and a point soon defaced:
Flesh to the Soul, as a Flower to the Sun,
That in a storm or a tempest is disgraced:
Fortime may the Body-please,
Which is only carnal,
But it will the Soul^ diseases
That is still immortal,
Earthly joys are but ^oyes,
To the Souls election,
Worldly grace does defate
Man's divine perfection*
Fleshly delights to the earth that is flesh,
May be the cause of a thousand sweet ^oa^e^tings,
But the defaults of a fleshly desire
Brings to the soul many thousand sad tormentings,
Be not proud presumptious Man,
Since thou art a point so vase,
Of the least, and lowest Element,
Which has least and lowest place:
Mark thy fate, and thy state.
Which is only earth and dust,
And as grass, which alas
Shortly surely perish must.
Let not the hopes of an earthly desire,
Bar thee the joys of an endless contentation,
Nor let not thy eye on the world be so six^
To hinder thy heart from unfeigned recantation,
Be not backward in that course,
That may bring the Soul delight,
Though another way may seem
Far more pleasant to thy sight:
Do not go, if he says no,
That knows the secrets of they mind,
Follow this, thou shall not miss
And endless happiness to find,
FINIS.
