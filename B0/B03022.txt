AN ORDINANCE OF THE LORDS and COMMONS in PARLLIAMENT: To enable Sir William
Brereton Baronet, one of the Members of the House of Commons, to execute the
several Ordinances of Parliament, for Advance of Money within the County of
Chester, and County and City of Chester, and to take Subscriptions for the
better Supply and Maintenance of the Forces under his Command, for the security
of the said Places, and for prevention of the Access of the Irish Forces into
those Parts.
THE Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament taking into their serious
Consideration the present condition of the County of Chester, and of the County
and City of Chester, and the Parts adjacent; and the damage which has already
happened, and may still accrue to this Kingdom, by the frequent Access of the
Irish Forces into the said Place, (by means of the Haven of Chester being yet
within the enemies power) joining themselves with such Delinquents and Papists
as are now in Arms in those Parts against the Parliament; have thought fit
that course be timely taken for prevention of further mischiefs, by landing of
more Irish Forces in those Parts. And therefore that they might speedily reduce
the said County and City of Chester, and Places aforesaid, to their due
obedience to the King and Parliament, have thought it necessary, that competent
Supplies and Provisions be had and established, as well for the Discharge and
payment of such Arreares as are already due and owing to the Officers and
Soldiers employed in the service aforesaid, as for their future maintenance
and allowance during such time as their service shall be requisite. To which
end and purpose the said Lords and Commons having had good experience, and
being fully assured of the Fidelity and Resolution of Sir William B^ereton
Baronet, one of the Members of the House of Commons, and of the forwardness
and good affections of the Deputy Lieutenants, Commanders, and Inhabitants of
the said County of Chester, have ordained, and be it ordained by the said Lords
and Commons, That the said Sir William Brereton shall have full Power and
Authority, to take the Subscriptions of all such persons, as will voluntarily
lend or contribute any sum or sums of Money toward the Supplies and
Provisions aforesaid, and for other necessaries for the advancement of the said
Service: Which sums of Money to be subscribed as aforesaid, the said Sir William
Brereton, and his Assigns, shall and may receive and employ for the Service
aforesaid, and give Notes or Acquittances for the several sums so received;
which said Notes or Acquittances shall be a sufficient Specialty and Evidence
for the several persons that shall lend or contribute any Money as aforesaid,
to demand repaiment thereof, with such increase as shall be agreed upon, so as
the same shall not exceed eight pounds per centum. And for the better inabling
the said Sir William Brereton to make repaiment of such Moneys as shall be
lent for the said purposes, and to perform such Conditions and Agreements as
the several Subscribers and Lenders shall agree unto as aforesaid; and for the
maintenance and supplies of the said Forces, and further advancement of the
aforesaid Service. Be it further ordained by the said Lords and Commons, That
the said Sir William Brereton, together with the Deputy Lieutenants, and
Committees of the laid County of Chester, and the County of the City of
Chester, or any two, or more of them, shall have full power and authority to
put in Execution, within the said County of Chester, and the County of the
City of Chester, (when the same shall be reduced) the several Ordinances of
this present Parliament hereafter mentioned: That is to say, The Ordinances for
sequestration of Malignants, Delinquents, and Papists Estates. The Ordinance
for the levying of Moneys by way of Excise, or New Impost. The Ordinance for
the raising of money, by taxing such as have not at all contributed, or not
according to their Estates. The Ordinance for the Weekly Assessements, and all
other Ordinances made this present Parliament, for advance of Money through the
Whole Kingdom and Dominion of Wales, for the Service of the King and
Parliament, so far forth as they, or any of them, have not been already
fully executed within the Places aforesaid: And to take care for the full and
due Execution of the said Ordinances according to the Tenor and true meaning
of the same, respectively. And for the more speedy raising of Moneys for the
repayment of such Sums as shall be brought in by Subscriptions, as aforesaid,
and toward the satisfaction of such Officers and Soldiers as are or shall be
in Arreare of their just pay and allowance, and for whom there shall not be
present Pay and Provision allowed: Be it Ordained by the said Lords and
Commons, that the said Sir William Brereton, together with such Deputy
Lievtenants and Committees as aforesaid, shall have hereby full power and
authority to set and let the Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, of all Papists
and Delinquents which are or shall be seized and sequestered according to the
Ordinance of Parliament for sequestration, within the said County of Chester,
and County and City of Chester, or either of them from year to year, or by
Lease or Leases for the intents and purposes aforesaid, so long as the said
Sequestration shall continue. And in case the Lenders or Subscribers shall not
receive full satisfaction of their principal money to be lent or subscribed as
aforesaid, with the interest thereof, out of the Estates of Papists and
Delinquents, as aforesaid, or by such other means as is hereby provided as
aforesaid, That theu the said Lenders, and Subscribers, and every of them,
shall have the public faith of the Kingdom for the payment of such Sum and
Sums of Money as shall be due unto them. And whereas the said County of the
City of Chester, is wholly subjected to the power and tyranny of the Forces
raised against the Parliament, by reason whereof no Commissioners or other
Officers could as yet put in execution any of the said Ordinances of
Parliament: And whereas some persons formerly appointed by authority of the
Parliament to be Commissioners and Officers within the said County of Chester,
and County of the City of Chester, to execute the Ordinances aforesaid, for
the service of the Parliament, have since neglected and deserted the same, and
manifested their disaffections thereunto. Be it therefore ordained by the said
Lords and Commons, that for the supply thereof the said Sir William Brereton,
together with such Deputy Lievtenants and Committees as aforesaid, shall have
full power and Authority to name and appoint such Commissioners, Treasurers,
Collectors, and other officers within the said County of Chester, and County
and City of Chester, when the same shall be reduced, as shall be necessary
(through the defect aforesaid) for the better putting in execution of all and
every the Ordinances of Parliament before mentioned, and of all other
Ordinances of Parliament, in case either no Commssioners or other Officers be
named by the Authority of Parliament, to put the same in execution within the
said County of Chester, and County and City of Chester, or either of them, or
in case the Commissioners or other Officers already named, have neglected or
deserted the said Service, or otherwise discovered their disaffections to the
proceedings of Parliament, which said Commissioners and other persons so to be
named and appointed by the said Sir Will. Brereton, together with the
Deputy-Lievtenants and Committees as aforesaid, shall by virtue of this present
Ordinance have as full power and authority to put the said respective Ordinances
in execution, as if they were named by both Houses of Parl. and their names
inserted into the said respective Ordinance.

And be it also ordained by the said Lords and Commons, that the several
Sums of Money which shall be lent for the advancement of the said Service, and
such increase as shall be due for every respective Sum so lent according to
the true intent and meaning of this Ordinance, shall be satisfied and paid out
of the Moneys that shall be raised within the places aforesaid, by virtue of
the aforementioned Ordinances, or of this present Ordinance. And the said Sir
William Brereton, with such Deputy Lievtenants and Committees as aforesaid, are
hereby enabled and authorized to call to Account upon Oath all such persons of
the said County of Chester as have received any Moneys by Authority from the
Parliament: As also to take Accounts upon Oath from time to time of the said
Commissioners, Treasurers, and other persons who shall receive any Moneys
within the said places by such Authority as aforesaid, and the same to convert
and employ for the services aforesaid, and to give such fitting and reasonable
allowances unto such persons as shall be employed in the execution of the
Ordinances aforesaid, and of this present Ordinance, or any of them, for their
pains and charges therein, as the said Sir William Brereton shall think fit,
provided that such allowance shall not exceed the respective Rates allowed in
other Counties of the Kingdom for putting the said Ordinances in execution:
And if any Treasurers, Collectors or others shall refuse to account or pay in
the Moneys wherewith they are charged, then the said Sir William Brereton,
together with such Deputy Lievtenants and Committees as aforesaid, shall
return their Names to one, or both Houses of Parliament. And the said Sir
William Brereton, together with such number of Deputy-Lievtenants, or
Committees, as aforesaid, is hereby Authorized to Administer the several Oaths
specified in the aforesaid Ordinances unto such Commissioners and Persons
(which have not already taken the same) as by the true meaning of the said
Ordinances, or of this present Ordinance, or any of them, ought to take the
same. And be it further ordained by the said Lords and Commons, That the
Personal Estates of such Delinquents and Papists within the Cities of London
and Westminster, and within twenty miles of the same, not yet sequestered nor
discovered; and which shall be discovered by the said Sir William Brereton, or
such Person or Persons as he shall Authorize under his Hand and Seal for that
purpose, within two Months next after the publishing in Print of this
Ordinance, shall be allowed unto the said Sir William Brereton, for the further
Advancement of the said Service, provided that the said concealed Estates
exceed not the Sum of five thousand pounds: And that the said Sir William
Brereton, or any Person Authorized by him, as aforesaid, nor any of them, shall
possess themselves of the said Papists or Delinquents Estates, before he or
they acquaint the Committee of Lords and Commons for Sequestrations therewith,
to the end they may judge of the Delinquencie of the Persons, before his, or
their Estates be sequestered and taken away.

And be it further Ordained by the Lords and Commons, That the said Sir William
Brereton shall have Power and Authority, and is hereby required to Administer
the Covenant (appointed to be taken by the three Kingdoms of England,
Scotland, and Ireland) to all Persons within the said County of Chester, and
the County of the City of Chester, who ought to take the same (by the late
Ordinance and Instructions for that purpose) and have not already taken it.

And be it further Ordained by the said Lords and Commons, that the said Sir
William Brereton, together with the Deputy-Lievtenants and Committees, as
aforesaid, shall have Power to call before them all Ministers and
Schoolemasters within the County of Chester, and the County of the City of
Chester, that are scandalous in there lives, or ill-affected to the Parliament,
or Fomenters of this unnatural War, or shall wilfully refuse obedience to
the Ordinances of Parliament, or shall have deserted their ordinary place of
residences not being employed in the Service of the King and Parliament; and
they shall have power to send for any Witnesses, and examine any Complaint or
Testimony against them, upon Oaths of such Persons as shall and may be produced
to give Evidence against them: and upon such Proofs of the aforesaid Crimes,
the said Sir William Brereton, together with the Deputy Lieutenants and
Committees aforesaid, have hereby power to remove and eject all such scandalous
Ministers and Schoolemasters, and in their places to nominate and apoint such
learned, able, godly, and fit Persons, as they (with the advice and consent of
three, or more, godly and learned Divines of the said County of Chester, which
they shall call unto them for that purpose) shall think fit; and shall cause
all such Ministers and Schoolemasters, so nominated, appointed, and placed, to
be put into possession of the said Churches and Schools, who shall and may
respectively take, receive, and perceive to their own uses, the Profits and
Revenues belonging to the said several Churches and Places, in as large and
ample manner, as the several Ministers and Persons in the said several places
have formerly used to do.

FINIS.
