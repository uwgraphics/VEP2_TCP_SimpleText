GOld taken from ye Kings Harbengers?
down a down a down.
As seldoms has been seen,

And carried by bold Robin Hood
for a present to the Queen.
down a down a down.
If that I live an year to an end.
thus began Queen Katherine say,
Bold Robin Hood I will be thy friend,
and all thy Yeomen gay.
The Queen is to her Chamber gone
as fast as she can wen,
She calls unto her lovely Pages,
his name was Richard Patrington.
Come hither to me thou lovely Page,
come thou hither to me:
For thou must Post to Nottingham
as fast as thou can dree.
And as thou go to Nottingham,
search all those English Wood,
Enquire of one good Yeoman or another,
that can tell thee of Robin Hood.
Sometimes he went, sometimes he ran
as fast as he could wen.
And when he came to Nottingham,
there he took up his Inn.
And when he came to Nottingham,
and had took up his Inn,
He calls for a pottle of Rhenish Wine
and drinks a health to his Queen.
There sat a Yeoman by his side,
tell me sweet Page said he,
What is thy business, or the cause,
so far in the North Country.
This is my business, and the cause,
fir, I Will tell it you for good.
To inquire of one good Yeoman or another,
to tell me of Robin Hood.
I Will get my horse betime in the morn,
by it be break of day,
And I will show thee bold Robin Hood,
and all his Yeomen gay.
When that he came at Robin Hoods place,
he tell down on his knee:
Queen Katherine she does greet you well,
she greets you well by me.
She bids you post to fair London Court.
not fearing any thing,
For there shall be a little sport
and she has sent you her King.
Robin took his Mantle from his back,
it was of the Lincoln green,
And sent it by this lovely Page
for a present to the Queen.
In Summer time when leaves grow green
it is a seemly sight to see,
How Robin Hood himself had dressed
and all his Yeomandree.
He clothed his men in Lincoln green,
and himself in scarlet red,
Black hats, white feathers all alike,
now bold Robin Hood is Rid.
And when he came at Londons Court,
he fell down on his knee,
Thou art welcome Locksly said the Queen,
and all thy Yeomen three.
The King is into Finsbury field,
down a down a down.
Marching in battle ray,
down a down a down.
And after follows bold Robin Hood
and all his Yeomen gay.
down a down a down.
The Second Part,
To the same Tune.
COme hither Tepus, said the King,
down a down a down,
Bow-bearer after me,
down a down a down,
Come measure me out with this line
how long our mark shall be.
down a down a down.
What is the Wager said the Queen?
that must I now know here,
Three hundred Tun of Rhenish Wine
three hundred tun of Beer.
Three hundred of the fattest Hearts
that run on Dallom Lee,
That Is a Princely Wager, said the King
that needs must I tell thee.
With that bespake one Clifton then
full quickly and full soon,
Measure no Mark for us most Sovereign Liege
we will shoot at Sun and Moon.
Full fifteen score your Mark shall be,
full fifteen score shall stand,
I Will lay my Bow, said Clifton then,
I Will cleave the Willow Wand.
With that the Kings Archers led about
while it was three and none,
With that the Ladies began to shout,
Madam, your Game is gone.
A boon, a boon, Queen Katherine cries,
I crave on my bare knee,
Is there any Knight of your privy Counsel
on Queen Katherines part will be?
Come hither to me sir Richard Lee,
thou art a Knight full good,
For I do know by thy pedigree,
thou sprang'st from Gowers blood.
Come hither to me thou Bishop of Here-fordshire,
for a noble Priest was he,
By my silver Miter, said the Bishop then
I Will not bet one penny.
The King has Archers of his own,
full ready and full light,
And these be strangers every one,
no man knows what they height.
What will thou bet said Robin Hood
thou see our Games the worse,
By my silver Miter, said the Bishop then
all the Money within my purse.
What is in thy purse, said Robin Hood,
throw it down on the ground,
Fifteen score Nobles, said the Bishop then
its near an hundred pound.
Robin Hood took his bag from his side
and threw it down on the green:
William Scadlock went smiling away,
I know who this money must win.
With that the Kings Archers led about,
while it was three and three,
With that the Ladies gave a shout,
Woodcock beware thy knee.
It is three, and three, now said the King,
the next three pays for all:
Robin Hood went and whispered to yt Queen
the Kings part shall be but small.
Robin Hood he led about,
he sent it underhand,
And Clifton with a bearing Arrow
he clave the Willow wand.
And little Midge the Millers son,
he shot not much the worse,
He shot within a singer of the prick
now Bishop beware thy purse.
A boon, a boon, Queen Katherine cries
I crave that on my bare knee,
That you will angry be with none,
that is at my party.
They shall have forty days to come,
end forty days to go.
And three times forty to sport and play
then welcome every one.
Then thou art welcome Robin Hood said ye Queen,
and so is little John,
So is Midge the Millers Son,
thrice welcome every one.
Is this Robin Hood the King ^^w said?
for it was told to me,
That he was slain in the Palace gate,
so far in the North Country.
Is this Robin Hood, quoth ye Bishop then
as I see well to be,
Had I known that had been that bold Outlaw
I would not a bet one penny.
He took me late on Saturday at night,
and bound me fast to a tree,
And made me sing a Mass God wot,
to him and his Yeomen three.
What and if I did, says Robin Hood,
of that Mass I was full fain;
For recompense to thee he says
here is half thy Gold again.
Now nay, now nay, says little John,
down a down a down.
Master that may not be,
down a down a down.
We must give gifts to the Kings Officers
that Gold will serve thee and me.
down a down a down.
