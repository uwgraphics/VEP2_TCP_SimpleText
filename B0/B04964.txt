^ Showing how King Henry, with the Earl Martial, in Friars Habits, came to her
instead of two Friars from France, which she sent for.
To a pleasant new Tune.


QUeen Elenor was a sick woman,
and afraid that she should dye;
Then the sent for two friars of France,
for to speak with them speedily.
The King called down his nobles all,
by one, by two, and by three;
And sent away for Earl Martial,
for to spenk with him speedily.
When that he came before the King,
he fell on his bended knee,
A boon, a hoon, our Gracious King,
that you sent so hastily.
I Will pown my livings, and my hands,
my scepter and my crown,
That whatever Queen Elenor says,
I will not write it down.
Do you but put on one fryar's coat.
and I Will put on another.
And we will to Queen Elenorgo,
one friar like another.
Thus both at ired then they go:
when they came to White Hall,
The bells they did ring, and the quirissers sing,
and the torches did light them all.
when that they came before the Queen,
they fell on their bended knee,
A boon, a boon our Gracious Queen,
that you sent so hasiily.
Are you two friars of France, she said,
which I suppose you be:
But if you are two English friars,
then hanged you shall be.
We are two friars of France, they said,
as you suppose we be,
We have not been at any mass
since we came from the sea.
The first vile thing that e'ex I did,
I will to you unfold,
Earl Martial had my maidenhead,
underneath this cloth of gold.
That is a vile sin, then said the King,
God may forgive it thee:
Amen, amen, quoth Earl Martial
with a heavy heart then spoke he.
The next vile thing that ever I did,
to you I Would not deny;
I made a box of poison strong,
to poison King Henry.
That is a vile sin then said the King,
God may forgive it thee:
Amen, amen, quoth Earl Martial,
And I with it so may be.
The next vile thing that e'ex I did,
to you I will discover,
I poysoded fair Rosamond,
all in fair, Woodstock-bower
That is a vile sin, then said the King,
God may forgive it thee:
Amen, amen, quoth Earl Martial
and with it so may be.
Do you see yonder is little Boy,
a catching of the Bail?
That is Earl Martial's son, the said,
and I love him the best of all
Do you see yonder is little Boy,
a tossing of the bail,
That is King Henry's son she said,
and I love him the worst of all.
His head is like unto a bull,
his nose is like a boat.
No matter for that, King Henry said,
I love him the better therefore.
The King pulled off his fryar's coat,
and appeared all in red;
She shrieked and she Cried, she wrung her hands,
and said, she was betrayed.
The King looked over his left shoulder,
and a grim look looked he,
And said, Earl Martial, but for my oath,
then hanged should thou he.
FINIS.
