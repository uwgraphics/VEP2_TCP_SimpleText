THE CASE OF THE Transport-Ships, taken up in the Years 1689, 1690, and 1691,
for the REDVCTION of IRELAND. Humbly offered to the High Court of PARLIAMENT
WHEREAS an Act passed the last Session of Parliament, Entitled, An Act for
Granting to His Majesty several Additional Duties upon Coffee, Tea, etc.
toward Satisfaction of the Debts due for Transport Service, for the Reduction
of Ireland; which Act was to Continue but for Three Years, at Five Pounds per
Cent per Annum Interest.

And the said Fund being only given for Three Years, it has so far Lessened
the Value of the said Debt, as that those many Poor People, in the sundry
Seaports all round this Kingdom, who are concerned therein, can obtain very
little or no Credit thereon.

And many of them being Widows, and Fatherless Children, who, for want of what
has been so long their just due, are rendered real Objects of the Pity and
Compassion of this Honorable House:

It is therefore Humbly Prayed (for the better Relief of the Persons concerned
in the said Debt) That it may be Enacted, That the Duties arising by the said
Act, may be continued in Force for Payment of the Interest of the said Debt,
until the Principal shall be provided for by the Parliament.
