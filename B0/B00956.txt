A LETTER OF a Baker of Boloigne sent to the Pope
BEhold Master Pope, we have had wonderful great winds without any rain,
and I am verily persuaded that the cloud wherein your Thunderbolt was enclosed
was not well comprised, to make the clap sound upon the earth; or else, that
the Venetian water was of so great virtue, yt it extinguished or quenched the
fire that threatened to burn and consume all Italy: But it may be, that
therein you immitated Jupiter (of whom you hold the Capitol) and gave out
many threatening words, but durst not strike: contenting your self to show
what your Cyclops can do, without making proof thereof upon men's heads: which
I believe to be true, if they had sought by prayers and Oblations to mollify
and appease your wrath and furious displeasure, and not by obstinate contempt,
or rather (as many men report) by an assured constancy, which the Venetians
have showed in their just and rightful cause. But shall I tell you what I
think? I am of opinion that you feared that the promises and the faith of the
Spaniards are not so smoothe as their faces: and that the Venetians should have
ceazed on Boulougne, with other places of ye Churches patrimony, they would
make as honest and good agreement with them, as they have lately made with the
new Commonwealth of Holland. Let them say what they will of you Master Pope:
for my part I perceive and find, that you have done great good unto our holy
Mother the Church, by disputation moved and stirred up between you and the
Venetians: In times past, there was none but the wicked and pestiferous
Huguenots which disputed and enueighed against the holy Seat of Rome, and would
by no means acknowledge any of Saint Peter's swords to belong unto you: but
now at this time they are your own natural children, your tender and most
deerly belooued friends, who perceiving you to be too much burdenned and
ouerlade^ by bearing of two swords, have pulled out of your hands the one,
which is called the temporal Sword, and so dulled and blunted the other, that
from hence-foorth, it shall not cut but in measure and reason: But to remedy
the matter, if you will follow my counsel, you shall do well and wisely to
excommunicate all Princes and Potentates of Christendom, and to give their
Realms and Dominions to those that have the best Mittens to lay hold of the
Catte: But I will tell you what will fall out thereupon: they will all flatlye
make answer that they will do nothing, and tell you plainly, that it is not in
your power, to take that from them which you never gave them. And to that end,
they will cause Acts of Parliaments to be confirmed and ratified within their
States and Dominions, and record it as a Decree, or Re iudicata for all
posterities: and so you may sit down upon your tail with all your Pretenses,
and take your ease, whilst men come to kiss your feet, and so that solemn
disputation shall be ended in your time, without taking any great pains to
assemble a general Council, to tell both you and my Lord Bellarmine, that it
is not a matter of Breuiaries to govern and command kingdoms: and that you
have no more authority to meddle with ye Temporal power of Princes, then you
would have them to intermeddle with your spiritual government. No doubt it
will procure great good unto your seat, and somewhat abate the papal
insolences and threatenings, and by that means put Rome out of a great fear,
and consequently bereave it of the hate of many men.

Touching the Venetians, by whom so notable and memorable an enterprise has
been begun, I am sure, that you for your part will judge and esteem them to be
worthy of a pardon and dispensation, to go into paradise, or to hell: and that
they may lawfully hereafter bear in their shield of arms, a great pair of
Sheeres, to witness to all posterity, that they were the first (among your
faithful Masse-mongers) that durst curtall and clippe your garment, which
dagled too long on the ground. I counseled you before, to give all the Kingdoms
and Dominions of ye princes of Christendom as a pray unto their enemies: to
the end that they may all flatly and plainly tell you, that they will not
dance after such unpleasant music. And if you will believe me, you shall
first begin with the house of Austria: and yet I am content that your ears
should be cut off, if you do not find that it is not Catholic in that point.
It is chiefly divided into three heads: as the Emperor, the King of Spain,
and the Arehduke Albertus: and in which of them (I pray you) do you not find
just occasion of deposition?

Touching ye Emperor, he has made you the Turks Grandfather, taking him for
his Son, and is so much busied with his Mathematicia^s, to take the measure and
compass of the heavens, that he forgets and neglects his government on
the earth* Is not this sufficient to depose him, and to raise the Duke of
Bauaire in his place, as your predecessors in times past sought to do?

As for the King of Spain, he is already absolutely excommunicated, ipso facto:
for retaining and witholding Scicilia, and your noble kingdom of Naples from
you. Ask Baronius counsel, and I am assured that he will tell you that you may
lawfully kill and eat him (according to the commandment given by God unto S.
Peter) and though it were in the middle of Lent: and suppose I pray you, what
joy and pleasure it would be to that good old man, if he could as well take the
Crown from the King of Spaines head, as the King of Spain took your place
from him?

There rests nothing now but to deal with yt Archduke Albertus, that durst
be so bold, to make a truce, and to procure a peace with the Heretics of
Holla^d: it is not that a sufficient crime, and a great offense to incur your
sentence of displeasure? but if you think good to spare him, in regard of his
ancient priesthood, yet you must at the least excommunicate Spinolaes pursse,
which is one of the greatest causes of this conuention: but I am verily
persuaded, that at your commandment the Archduke will always find occasion to
renew the war: as first, that faith ought not be kept and observed with
Heretics: and secondly, that a prince cannot infranchise his subjects, and
renounce his superiority over them to the prejudice of the estate of him and
his successors: besides that, there may be a kind of equivocation, or mental
reservation of some words used in the making of the treaty of peace: Again,
it is lawful at al times to make war for our holy mother the Church: and to
conclude, the Spaniard will not care greatly to prove perjured for his own
profit and commodity.

When you have excommunicated all these of the house of Austria, then you must
set upon the King of France, and you may find matter enough to be offended and
to take displeasure against him, and he means enough not to care much for it,
and to send you bull for bull, letter for letter and if you will, two blows for
one: and finally to proceed to my intent, he will take an oath of all his
subjects (specially the Priests) that they shall neither believe nor teach,
that the Pope can directly or indirectly, nor by right or wrong, neither yet by
the head or the foot, depose a lawful king out of his Throane.

But now we come to another great matter, and the question consists herin,
what we shall do with the king of England? for assure your self, he is not
for you, and which is worse you shall not find much matter to lay hold upon
touching him, nor his royal proceedings; I am persuaded that the best way for
you will be to let him alone, or else that you procure his friendship and that
you wholly renounce all superiority over him, as the Spaniard has done to those
of Holland: and in regard thereof, he will make you a great present of all the
Priests and Jesuits in his country, which he will send unto you to Rome: and
because that England is interdicted, he will procure that you shall be obeyed
in that point, and that the Mass shall be no more used in his Dominions.

This master pope I thought necessary to be written unto you, praying you to
send me good store of holy Medales, but I would have them al of pure and fine
gold, or else they will do me but small pleasure: Farewell.

From my Bakehouse in Boulougne, upon this good Sunday, of Quasimodo.
FINIS.
