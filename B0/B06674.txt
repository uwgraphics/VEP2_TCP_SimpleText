The woeful Lamentation of Mistress Jane Shore, a Goldsmiths wife in London,
sometimes King Edward the seconds Concubine, who for her wanton life came to a
miserable end. Set forth for the example of all lewd women.
The tune is, Live with me.


If Rosamond that was so fair
Had cause her sorrows to declare.
Then let Jane Shore with sorrow sing
That was beloved of a king.
then wanton wives in time amend,
for love and beauty will have end.
In Maiden years my beauty bright.
Was loved dear of Lord and Knight,
But yet the love that they required
Then was not as my friends desired.
My Parents they for thirst of gain,
(...) Husband for me did obtain,
(...) their pleasure to fulfill,
(...) ^orcd to wed against my will.
(...) ^atthew Shore I was a Wife
(...) Lust brought ruin to my life,
(...) then my time so lewdly spent
^ow makes my soul for to lament
In Lumbard street I once did dwell,
As London yet can witness well,
Where many gallants did behold
My beauty in a shop of Gold.
I spread my Plume as wantons do
Some sweet and secret friend to woe,
Because my love I did not find
Agreeing to my wanton mind,
At last my name in Court did ring,
Into the ears of Englands King,
Who came and liked and love requird
But I made coy what he desird.
Yet Mistress Blague a neighbor near
Whose friendship I esteemed dear,
Did say it was a gallant thing
To be beloved of a King.
By her perswasons I was led
For to defile my marriage bed.
And wrong my wedded husband Shore,
Whom I had lovd ten years before,
In heart and mind I did rejoice
That I had made so sweet a choice.
And therefore did my state resign
To be king Edwards Concubine.
From City then to Court I went,
And reapt the pleasures of content,
I had the joys that love could bring,
And knew the secrets of a King,
When I was thus advanced on high,
Commanding Edward with mine eye,
For Mistress Blague I in short space
Obtain d a living of his Grace.
No friend I had but in short time
I made unto promotion climb.
But yet for all this costly pride
My husband could not me abide,
His bed though wronged by a King,
His heart with grief did deadly sting.
From England soon he goes away
To end his life upon the Sea.
He could not live to see his name
Im^pared by my w^nton shame,
Although a Prince of peerlesse might
Did reap tha pleusurs of his right,
Long time I lived in the Court,
With Lords and Ladies of great port
For when I smiled all men were glad,
but when I mourned my prin. grew sad
But yet an honest mind I bore
To helpless people that were poor,
I still redrest the Orphans cry,
And saved their lives condemned to die
I still had ruth on widows tears,
I succored babes of tender years,
And never looked for other gain
But love and thanks for all my pain.
At last my Royal King did dye,
And then my days of woe grew nigh,
When Crookback Richard got ye crown
K. Edwards friends were soon put down
I then was punished for my sin,
That I so long had lived in,
Yea every one that was his friend
That tyrant brought to shameful end.
Then for my rude and wanton life,
That made a strumpet of a Wife,
I penance did in Lumbard street,
In shameful manner in a sheet,
Where many thousands did me view,
Who late in Court my credit knew,
Which made ye tears run down my face
To think upon my foul disgrace.
Not thus content they took from me,
My Goods, my Living and my Fee.
And charged that none should me relive
Nor any succor to me give.
Then unto Mistress Blague I went
To whom my Jewels I had s^nt,
In hope thereby to ease my want
When riches failed and love grew scant.
But she denied to me the same
When in my need for them I came,
To recompense my former love,
Out of her doors she did me shove.
So l^^e did vanish with my state,
W^^^^ now my soul repents too late
Th^^^^ore example take by me
For friendship parts in poverty,
But yet one friend among the rest,
Whom I before had seen distr^st
And saved his life condemned to dye
Did give me food to succor me
For which by Law it was decreed
That he was hanged for this deed.
His death did grieve me so much more
Then had I died my self therefore
Then those to whom I had don good
Durst not restore me any food.
Whereby in vain I begged all day,
And still in streets by nights I lay
My gowns beset with pearl and gold,
Are turned to simple garments old
My chains and gems and golden ^ings
To filthy rags and loathsome things.
Thus was I scorned of maid and wife,
For leading such a wicked life.
Both sucking babes and children small
Did make a pastime at my fall,
I could not get one bit of bread
Whereby my hunger might be fed
Nor drink but such as channels yields,,
Or stinking ditche in the fields
Thus weary of my life at length,
I yielded up my vital strength
Within a ditch of loathsome scent,
Where carrion dogs do much frequent
The which now since my dying day,
Is Shoreditch called as writers say,
Which is a witness of my sin,
For being Concubine to a King.
You wanton wives that fall to lust
Be you assured that God is just.
Whoredom shall not escape his hand,
Nor pride unpunisht in this Land.
If God to me such shame should bring
That yielded only to a King,
How shall they escape th^^ daily run
To practice sin with every man?
You husbands match not but for love,
Leest some disliking after prove.
Women be warned when you are wivs
What plagus belong to sinful lives.
then maids and wivs in time amend.
for love and beauty will have end.
T^^ (...) his wives wantonness, the wrongs of marriage, the fall of pride
being a warning for all women to take heed by.
To the same tune.
IF she that was fair Londons Pride
For beauty famed both far and wide.
With Swan-like Song in sadness told,
Her deep distresses manifold.
Then in the same let me also
Now bear a part of such like woe
Kind Matthew Shore men called me,
A Goldsmith once of good degree
And might have lived long therein
Had not my wife bin wool^ to sin:
Ah gentle jane thy wanton Race
Has brought us to this foul disgrace
Thou had all things at wish and will
Thy wanton fancy tu fulfill
No London dame nor Merchants wife
Did lead so sweet and pleasant life,
Then gentle Jane the truth report,
Why leftst thou me to live in Court,
Thou had both gold and silver store,
No wife in London then had more
And once a ^^k to walk the field,
To see what pleasure it would yield,
But woe to me that liberty
Has brought us to this m^sery,
I married the^ when thou were young
Before (...) ^^^^^st what did belong
To husb^^^^ lov^ or marriage state,
W^^ch no^ (...) ^^^le repents too late
Thus w^^^^^ (...) thee unjust,
And (...) my trust,
But (...) possessed my room,
And cropped m^ (...) ^allant b^oom.
Fair L^^^^^^ ^^^^^^me and my joy,
My he^^^ (...) in deep annoy,
To th^^^ (...) ^^blike shame:
Thy (...) ^^^^^ht my good name.
And (...) ^^ch man and wife,
In je^^^^^ (...) my life,
And e^^^^ (...) ^ther said
That Sh^^^^ (...) the wanton played.
Where^^ (...) to change
My dw^^^^^^ (...) Country strange.
My Lands (...) ^^^ds I sold away,
And so from (...) went to Sea
Oppressed with g^^^^ (...) woeful mind.
But left my cause of grief behind.
My loving wife whom once I thought
Would never be to lewdness brought,
But women now I well espy
Are subject to unconstancy.
And few there be so true of love,
But by long suit will wanton prove.
For flesh is frail and women weak
When Kings for love great suit do make
But yet from England my depart
Was with a sad and heavy heart.
Whereat when as my leave I took,
I sent back many a heavy by look.
Desiring God if it might be
To send one sigh sweet Jane to thee
For if thou had but constant bin
These days of woe I never had seen.
But yet I grieve and mourn full sore,
To think what pl^gus are left in store
For such as careless tread awry
The modest steps o^ ^y.
Ah gentle Jane if thou did know
The uncoth pa^hs I daily ^oe.
And wo^^^ tears for the I shed
For wronging thus my marriage b^d
Then sure I am thou would confess
My love was sure though in distress.
Both Flanders France. and Spain I past
And came to Turkey at the last
And there within that mighty Court
I lived long in honest sort,
Desiring God that sits in Heaven
That Lovers sins might be forgiven.
I there advanced thy loving name,
Of living Wights ^he fairest Dame.
The praise of E^^^^^ds beauty stain
All which thy husband did maintain.
And set thy picture there in Gold
For Kings and Princes to behold,
But when I thought upon thy sin
thy wanton thoughts delighted in,
I grieved that such a comely face
Should hold true honor in disgrace.
And counted it a lucklesse day
Wherein thou first did stray away.
Desiring then some news to hear,
Of her my soul did love so dear,
My secrets then I did impart
to one well skilled in Magic Art,
Who in a Glass did truly show
Such things as I desired to know.
I there did see thy Courtly state,
thy pomp thy pride, thy glory great,
And likewis^ there I did behold.
My Jane in Edwards arms enfold.
thy secret Love I there espied,
thy rise, thy fall, and how thou died.
thy naked body in the Street
I saw due penance in a sheet,
Bare foot before a Beadles wand,
With burning Taper in thy hand,
And babes not having use of tongue
Stood pointing as she past along,
Thus ended was the shame of thine,
Though God gave yet no end to mine
When I supposed my name forgot
And time had washed away my ^^^t,
And in an other Princes Reign
I came to England back again,
But staying their my friends decay'^
My Princes Laws I disobeyed
And by true Justice Judged to die
For clipping Gold in secrecy
By gold was my best living made,
And so by gold my life betrayed
Thus have you heard the woeful strif^
That came by my unconstant wife
Her fall my death wherein is showed
The story of a strumpet lewd.
In hope thereby all women may
Take heed how they the wantons pla^
The Description OF Jane Shore.
THis woman's beauty has bin highly praised by a famous writer that lived in
her time, Named Thomas Moore who described her in this manner.

Before her death she was poor and aged, her stature was mean, her hair of a
dark yellow, her face round and full her eyes gray, her body fat, white and
smooth, her countenance cheerful like to her conditions.

There is a picture of hers to be seen in London, it is such as she was when
she rose out of her bed in the morning, having nothing on but a rich Mantle
cast under her arm, over which her naked arm did lie.

what her Fathers name is, or where s;he was born is not certainly known, but
her Husband Matthew Shore, a young man of right good Parentage, wealth and
behavior, abandoned her bed after the King had made her his Concubine.
