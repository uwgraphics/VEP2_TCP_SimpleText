Eccles. 11. 11. Rejoice, O young man in thy youth, and let thine heart-cheer
thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the sight of thine eyes: but know
that for all these things, God will bring thee to Judgment.

TO THE Christian READER
THe means of Edification in the Holy Scripture (gentle Reader may all be
referred to three heads Instructions for all. Consolations for the oppressed.
Threats for those tha^ err, and are obstinate. These make threefold cord,
whereby God labor to draw mankind to this end. Her^ have thou one strain
twisted, viz. the judgment or death of the damned. (...) therefore Gods
mercies cannot allu^ thee to love him, here have thou hi^ judgments to scourge
thee that tho^ may fear him, that beginning the wisdom in fear, thou may
so lear^ to love him, that his judgments being bitter to thy taste, may cause
thee seek to try how good he is in his me^cies. God give his blessing to his
ow^ ordinance for thy good.

THE REWARD Of the WICKED, SERMON Preached at Li^field in Sussex.
Matthew. 25. 46. And these shall go into everlasting pain.
THe recompense of the Righteous, and the reward of the wicked, described in
this verse, are both declared to be everlasting* ^he one embracing the other
despising an eternal Majesty. These that shall go into everlasting pain, are
the merciless, the cruel and hard hearted and with them all that go not into
life eternal, those that shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.

Our Savior Christ describing the punishmen^ of the damned, in the pa^able of
the Tares ^heweth that by his Angels they shall be boun^ up into bundles to be
burned: teaching that the that participate in sin shall be partakers (...)
punishment: and further that their Judgeme^^, shall be irrevocable, their
misery remediless, the^^ estate helpless, for whom God binds, who c^^ be able
to loose?

Curious division of the words I purposely om^^ observing the general
instruction which araise^ out of the words, without wresting of them, (...)
digressing from the true meaning of them.

The ungodly shall assuredly receive the punishment of eternal damnation at the
day of Judgment.

This doctrine is further confirmed by sundr^ places of Scripture.

In Matthew 13 is taught, that the Angels sha^^ gather together the tares that
is the children (...) the wicked, and bind them into bundles to bu^^ them.

In the 20 of the Revelation is showed th^^ death and hell, that is the heirs
of death and (...) were cast into the lake of fire, which is the secon^ death.

In the 21 of the Revelation is threatened, th^^ the fearful and unbelieving,
and abominable, (...) murther^rs and whoremongers, and sorcerers, (...)
idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the la^^ which burns with
fire and brimstone, which is t^^ second death.

Tribulation and anguish (says Saint Paul) she upon the soul of every one that
does evil, of the Jew (...), and also of the Grecian.

And in his Epistle to the Thessalonians that Jesus ^rist shall show himself
from Heaven, with his mighty ^ngels in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to them
^^^t do not know God and which obey not the Gospel (...) our Lord Jesus Christ.

Because the Justice of God does exact and ^erre, that as every man does sow,
so he shall ^^^p, and therefore he that sows to the flesh of (...) flesh
shall reap corruption, as on the other ^e, he that sows to the spirit, does
of the ^it reap eternal life.

How does it stand with Gods Justice to punish (...) ^emporal offense with an
eternal punishment? The wicked are justly punished for these causes. (...)
^^cause their sins are an offense of an eternal ^ajesty. 2. Because they
neglect an eternal ^^od propounded, and set before them, which (...) obedience
they may obtain; and so choose ^^^rnal misery through walking in disobedience.

Because if they did live eternally, they would ^o sin eternally. 4. Because
the damned do (...) eternally, their transgressions is coeternal with ^^eir
punishment; as therefore they shall ever ^^main in torment* so shall they for
ever remain (...) unbelief impenitency blasphemy: so that their ^^nishment is
not larger then their sins deserving

For the opening of this Doctrine, two thi^^^ are to be considered* First,
wherein the damnat^^^ of the wicked consists Secondly, How their punishment
extends. For the first, (...) damnation of the wicked stands in a twof^^^
punshment, called poena damni, and poena sen^ punishment of loss, and the
punishment of sen^^

The punishment of loss, is a separation fr^^ the presence of God, and from all
joys, pleasures attending the same. This is that wh^^^ the Apostle teaches,
that they shall be punis^^^ with everlasting perdition from the presence the
Lord and from the glory of his power. (...) how great a misery this is, may
appear, in t^^^ they are separated from Gods presence, are sepe^^ted from all
joy and pleasure, between which* extreme sorrow, and misery there is no mean;
in Gods presence (and not else where) is fuln^^^ of joy, and at his right hand
(and no where to be found) are pleasures for evermore: (...) for this cause our
Savior Christ accounts it greatest happiness of the pure in heart that (...)
shall see God: And Cain accounts it not the (...) judgment that should befall
him here on e^^^^ that he should be hid from the face of God. (...) were so
grievous to Cain to be separated from place of Gods Worship here on earth,
which is a type of the separation in the life to come: how grievous then must
it needs be to the dam^^^ (...) ^^e life to come to be indeed excluded from the
^y of God, and happiness of the glorified? ^he punishment of sense is the
inflicting of tor^^nts, and miseries, both on soul and body; for (...) shall be
the misery of the damned, that they ^^^ll not rest without joy, and sorrow but
as they (...) be deprived of al happiness, so shall they be op^^^ssed with all
unhappiness as they shall be debar^^^ of all delight and pleasure so they shall
be filled ^^^h all unspeakble torments, by many things are ^ir torments
expressed in the holy Scripture, ^st terrible, and most painful.

^ur Savior Christ says, Their worm never dies (...) their fire never goes
out, and again Cast that ^rofitable servant into utter darkness, there shall be
^ping, and gnashing of teeth, Matthew. 25 30. with ^y the like paraphrases and
denominations ex^ssing the like. Now if nothing can be more ^^^rible then utter
darkness, being that plague of ^^^pt, which next to the death of the first born
^^^st of all moved Pharaohs hard heart: if nothing ^re painful inwardly, then
the gnawing of the ^^^rt with the teeth of the serpent; if nothing ^^wardly
then the heat and burning of fire; yea, nothing more intolerable then the
continuance, these torments without ceasing or intermission ^n surely by these
descriptions the Lord would ^^ve us know that the punishment of the damned most
intolerable and so great as the fury of Gods wrath against sin can kindle, and
the rage of S^ can inflict.

Now the reasons that the damned do su^^^^ not only the punishment of loss, but
of sense, is, that they do not only lose the benefit of ^^^fort, but are also
tormented, are these: First the punishment, of loss. Because they neg^ and
despise the true good grace and glory off^^^^ unto them yea, and GOD himself,
the founta^^ all good, and therefore it is equal, and just their punishment
extend to this that they be s^^^^rated from GOD and his Glory from all good
(...) happiness. For GOD will forsake them (...) forsake him.

Secondly, of the punishment of sense, bec^^^^ they have chosen to follow that
which is evil, forbidden unto them, therefore it is just tha^ (...) reward of
their own hands be given unto t^ yea, it is equal Prove. 5. that his ^wn
iniquitie^ (...) the wicked himself, and that be holden with the (...) of his
own sin.

As for the second consideration, How fa^ (...) punishment of the wcked does
extend, it is evi^^^^ that it extends.

First, to every one, without respect or differ^^^^ of persons or properties,
to old, young, poor, weak, and mighty, noble and ign^^^^ wise and foolish,
Tribulation and anguish shall b^ (...) ^he soul of every one that does evil,
Romans 2. 6. (...) (...) ^het is prepared of old; it is even prepared for the
^^^g he has made it deep, and large, Isaiah 30. 33. (...) ^^^ondly, to every
part of the damned both to soul (...) body; yea, to every part of either of
them so (...) not so much as Dives tongue can be free from (...) heat of this
torment, Luke 16. 24. Th^rdly (...) the uttermost extremity, for it shall be
the ^^^reamest torment that may be the breath of ^^ds fury kindling it Isa 30.
33 and being without (...) pitying or commiseration: For there shall be (...)
^ement m^rciless to him that shows no mercy, Jam. (...) 3. Fourthly, to be
without ceasing, or inter^lion, so that it shall be restless without so much
(...) ^he refreshing of a drop of water, which were ^al thing in such a fire,
to cool any part of the ^^mented; and therefore our Savior Christ says (...)
^he place before named that their worm never ^h, and their fire never goes
out: the worm biteth (...) ^ong as he lives and the fire tormenteth so long
(...) ^t burns. Fifthly, to eternity, for it shall be ^^^rlasting without
end, and therefore it is not ^^^y called fire, to express the greatness of it,
but ^^^rlasting fire, to express the continuance of it. ^^tth. 25. 41. Which
causes me to remember (...) ^^at one says in his meditations: If the damned
^^re to continue in their torments but a thousand ^^^usand years, yet had they
some hope, if but so ^^ny years as there are stars in the sky, (...) sands on
sea, grass on the ground, and dust on the face of the earth in the greatest
drought, yet sh^^^ there be an end; nay, if but so many tho^ (...) thousand
years as are stars in the sky, sand on (...) sea, grass on the ground, and dust
on the fa^^ (...) the earth yet should there be one day an en^ (...) their
torments, but their misery is far other^ for so many thousand years being
ended, so (...) thousands of thousands are again to begin, w^^^^ also ever
shall begin, and never shall have en^

Now if it be demanded by the way, when there shall be in hell material fire to
the torme^^ (...) the damned.

I Answer, it is no point of faith, or man (...) necessary to salvation to know
yet freely to de^ my opinion without disparagement to the opi^^^^ of the
contrary minded, I see no reason to (...) contrary: for inasmuch as the body
sins (...) the soul it is just that it be punished with the (...) Now
insomuch as the Scripture has expressed torment of fire, I think it curiosity
to expo^^ that by a figure, and to be fain to search out a^^ther figurative
speech, to find a matter to torm^^^ the body, fire being apt to torment and
being (...) greatest of all torments, neither is it material (...) may be said
that then there must by that reason a material worm to gnaw, as well as fire to
bu^^ for fire can torment the body, but a worm can torment the soul, and
therefore that which can ^ally be understood to be done must be fig^^^^tively
expounded, which exposition that may be ^ne, so understood need not but
literaturely to ^e expounded.

This doctrine may be a powerful motive to all ^andring sinners that go astray
after the corrupti^ns of their own hearts in the desert paths of ^isobedience,
to return unto their GOD by true ^^pentance, least they die the death for their
^^sobedience: If the poor sheep in the wilderness ^d but know, that if they
continue straggling from ^^eir folk, they would assuredly be devoured of ^^e
Wolf, they would surely (although wanting (...) ^^ason) by the very conduct of
sense, make haste (...) the custody of their shepherd: This then being ^ost
certain, that all that go astray from the ways (...) GOD, and so continue
wandering either till ^^e day of their visitation be past, or till death ^^ke
away the time and place of repentance, shall (...) devoured of hell and
destruction: Oh, how ^ould this move us speedily to return to the fold (...)
CHRIST to wash away our sins with the tears (...) repentance, to redeem the
time, and to be ^rned, that they come not into this damnation? ^^nce may all
obstinate and impenitent sinners to ^^eir terror, see the assured end of all
their wicked ^urses by the eternal damnation both of body ^^d soul. What then
shall become of all Idolaters, ^dulterers, Drunkards, Swearers, breakers of ^^ds
Sabbaths, Covetous, Earthworms, Userers, Oppressors, and such like, that live
and die in t^^^^ sins? surely they shall be bound up in bundle^ (...) be
burned, they shall go into everlasting p^ Malefactors on earth have some hope
after s^^tence to escape their temporal punishment* men are drawn by many means
to revoke t^ sentences, and to grant their gracious pardon But in this
judgment the damned have to do (...) GOD, who is feared by no man's greatness
alte^ by no reward, with whom is no changing (...) shadow of turning, and
therefore his sentenc^ (...) unrecoverable: neither after this life is there
(...) time, place or liberty of repentance: but as (...) tree falls so it lies,
either to life or destruct^^^ Amen.
