An Account, OF A Wonderful CHILD, Born at VERONA, In a Letter, from ITALY, to
the Duke of BAVARIA.
Brussels, June 2d. 1700.
WE hear, the Elector of Bavaria, our Governor, has received a Letter from
Italy, importing as follows, That there was born at Verona (a City belonging to
the Republic of Venice) on the First of March last, a Child of a Genoese
Merchant residing there, which, the 2d.Day after its Birth, being in the Nurses
Lap, cried out, to the great terror of those that heard it, Mercy, Mercy,
Repentance. The Skin of it was rough, like a Hair-Cloth. It continued the first
Six Days, without taking any Food, and grew rougher and rougher; on the
following Days it took some Food, and on the 19th of that Month, was as big as
a Child of 4 Years of Age; from the 19th to the 22th, it continued always
kneeling, with its Arms a cross on another; and on the 28th cried out with a
loud Voice, and its Eyes full of Tears, Poor Sicily, Poor France, Unhappy
Parma, Waste and Desolate Italy, Frightful Naples, Destroyed Burgundy, Poland
full of Blood, Blood flows over all. The Inquisition has since taken this Child
into their Custody.

FINIS.
