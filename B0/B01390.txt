These venerable ancient song-inditers
Soared many a pitch above our modern writers:
Our numbers may be more refined than those,
But what we have gained in verse we have lost in prose.
Their words no shuffling double meaning knew;
Their speech was homely, but their hearts were true.

MOggy now rejoice and sing,
Ise present thee with a Ring,
Nay, and joyful News I bring,
my Wife is dead and buried:
Therefore let us be jolly,
Drive hence Melancholy,
This Night let us dally,
next day we'll be married.
To thy Shakum be not coy,
Thou'st have got a pretty Toy,
Which I Would willingly-enjoy,
and therefore sit down by me:
In my Arms I Will reaze thee,
Likewise kiss and squeeze thee,
Ise am sure 'twill please thee:
prithee do but try me.

Ise have muckle Gold in store,
What can thou desire more?
We shall live and never be poor,
but always blithe and bonny:
Drink good Sack and Sherry,
Always brisk and merry,
Never, never weary,
of my dearest Honey.
My Grandsire he is stiff and old,
Likewise I know his Blood is cold,
And will ever long be laid in Mold,
as being dead and buried:
Then Ise have his Riches,
Gray Coat, Leathern Breeches,
Oh how my Fingers Itches,
Dearest, to be Married!
Once I led a weary Life,
With a cross and froward Wife,
Which treated Care and Strife,
with her I was offended:
Now the Fates betide her,
No such Scold beside her,
Now a Grave does hide her,
and my Plague is ended.
For she is clearly fled away,
And has left her Shakum Gay,
Long I wished to see this day,
but never before could find it:
Now since she is buried,
We will not defer it,
But with speed be Married,
and with this Kiss I bind it.
Shakum Gay she then replied,
Ise will freely be your Bride,
And lig closely by your side,
it is my will and pleasure:
Never will Ise forsake (...)
But in Wedlock take (...)
And resolve to make thee
Lord of all my Treasure.
Farewell Rock and farewell Reel,
Thrice farewell my Spinning-VVheel,
Let them gang unto the Deel,
Ise freely can refuse them:
Having time and leisure,
Likewise Gold and Treasure,
Here Ise take my pleasure,
and no^ more will use them.
