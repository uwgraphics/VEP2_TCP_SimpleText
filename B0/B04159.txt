LONDONS INDEX OR Some Reflections ON THE New built MONUMEN^
-- Comitetur Punica Chartam
Spongia --
Mart.
WHat strange Idaea can present!
How Mysterious Providence
To Mortals does its gift dispense!
When it seems to have sent
Plagues, and Disorders, to unite
The World, and force us to delight;
How else could such a glorious Structure rise,
Wearying its Beholders eyes?
Which scarce
Can reach that height, which does ore-top the Universe.
See it surveys the City as its charge,
And seems to scorn
Flames, which lie buried in this flaming Urn;
The City's Liberty it does enlarge,
The Boys could never go
So high Processioning in the Air till now.
This is the Planet, which will always tell
The City's well;
For its Ascendant, it does London own,
Scarce one degree below the Moon.
2.
The Amazed Phoenix thinks it is built her nest,
And from the Desert straight does come,
Bathed in Arabian Gum,
Within these flames to take Eternal rest,
Hence forth Rome's Amphitheatre must bow;
This is Carpophorus his Spear,
And seems to threaten the Caelestial Bear.
The Dog Star now
Hastens to the South all cold with fear.
This is a Rival to the Gnossian Crown,
Which pale Cynthia longs to own.
When this the Persian did see,
He thought the Sun was risen in the West,
Some bow the knee:
Whilst each long-bearded reverend Priest
Consult the Sibyl Oracles, to find
What Heaven had designed:
But when they see him in the East appear,
They change their wonder into fear;
Till by its borrowed light, they see
Ours is as much below the Sun, as he
To CAESAR's Deity.

Now the East-Indians come from far,
Without a Compass, guided by this Star.
3.
The Egyptian Pyramids shrink in their heads,
And wish themselves laid in their Founders Beds;
Such Buildings more become a Child,
Naught but a heap of stones compiled:
There Is far more bravery
In the labourious House of an Industrious Be;
The years in which they builded were,
Require more wonder then their art or care.
But why such richness spent
About the fire's Monument?
Could it be thought in after years,
That BRUTE could ere erect:
Such Buildings, as themselves protect.
And fill the Neighboring World with fears?
No, the future Age must say,
'Twas CAESAR's Influence that ruled the day.
Nor could the World int's Infancy
Produce such Art as here we see:
Such Streets, in former Ages, must undo
The Populus, and the Senatus too;
I Would almost said Rome's PATER PATRIAE.
4.
Say then, whence all this cost
Do we in judgments boast?
Or is it Heavens second Covenant here below.
An Arrow to the watery Bow?
See how bright Iris hovers ore the top,
And promises whilst this remains,
(On which we ground our hope)
London shall never feel such flames again.
No wind so high can ever blow,
Nor do we fear the Winters Hail, or Snow,
It Is water when it comes here,
And does commence its Iceness from a lower Sphaere.
From this we may the City see
At large, and in Epitome.
When Airy Gods in silent nights shall rove,
This they will choose
To be their place of Rendezvous,
A Colony of power and love.
The Rhodian Coloss scorns to be outvied,
Complaining to its Deity,
Would fain resolved be,
And gladly int' is first disorder slide.
All that it now can boast of, is
That it sees this.
5.
England's great Theater beholds the frame
Their Founders being almost the same,
Both owe their height to SHELDON's name.
Here Is Pelion and Ossa too:
Typhon had laid a Siege, with less ado,
To Heaven and scaled the Sky,
Durst he have ventured half so high.
The Thames which underneath it trembling glides
Fearing the River Alpheus fate,
Ebbing, and flowing in a doubtful state,
The waves for dread do one another hide.
No more we'll f(...)
Foreign Invasions, to molest us here:
This when our Enemies shall see,
They Will yield, it does portend a destiny,
A Comet ominous,
Ruin to our Foes, but heal
In this bright Star Astrologers may find,
Being at the top.
Without a Telescope,
How all the City is inclined.
