THE CASE OF THE Miserable Orphans of the City of London, Presented to the
Honorable House of Commons.
Humbly Shows,
THat there are about fourteen hundred Orphans, whose Portions left them by
their Parents, and paid into the Chamber of the City of London, according to
the Custom of the said City, for security of their Portions, which have for
many years been detained from them that are of Age, and some out of their
Apprenticeships, who for want of their Money to set up their Trades, are
reduced to such Necessities, that it has deprived some of them of their
Senses, and others have killed themselves, having nothing to subsist with; We
having Received no more then Twopence in the Pound from the Chamber for many
years past. Our Necessities are very great, the present Exigencies we are under
are past Expression, the Grief of which has killed many, and others lie Sick
and Want, and others are in daily expectation of being sent to Goal for Debts,
that have been Contracted for Necessaries to keep them from Starving.

These and many other Grievances (which for brevity are omitted) are with
Submission humbly offered to your Compassionate Considerations, this Honorable
House of Commons being the only Redressers of the Grievances of those whose
Oppressors are too mighty for them, humbly beseeching your Honors, that you
will be pleased to give us a speedy Relief, thereby preventing the perishing of
some hundreds of us, which will Inevitably be before another Sessions.
