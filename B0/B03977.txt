The Knight and the Beggar-Wench.
Which does a wanton prank unfold,
In as merry a story as ever was told.
The Tune is, The Kings delight, or Turn-Coat.


I Met with a jovial Beggar
And into the Fields I led her,
and I laid her upon the ground;
Her face did not invite me,
Nor her smock did much delight me
but I think the young whore was sound;
With Ladies both fresh and gay
I often did sport and play,
yet a Beggar I Will take
for varieties sake,
She Will please me as well as they.
I have a good Wife, as fair
As ever drew English air
her pleasure is past compare,
Her cherry lips, cheeks, and eyes,
Her belly, her breast, and thighs,
might any but I suffice,
With her I so often play
And weary my time away
That a fouler to me
Would be fairer than she,
Variety wins the day,
This Beggar I shall describe,
Without any hope of bribe,
was one of the maunding tribe
She had a fine foot and leg,
As nimble as Do or Stag,
and then she began to beg;
So soon as my Horse she sees
She fell down upon her knees,
The whore had a sack
That hung at her back
Well furnished with Bread and Cheese,
She struck me into a dump
The jade was both young and plump,
with a round, and a ranting Rump;
Her feature had so much force,
It raised in me remorse
and drew me quite off my Horse,
But when I began to woo
She told me she would not do,
Quoth I pretty Mort,
Let me show thee some sport
She kissed me, and answered no,




My Horse to a twig I tied,
the begger-wench then replied
good Master get up and ride,
Yes so I will straight (thought I)
With that I drew something nigh
she strugled and cried fie, fie,
I am but a Beggar by breed,
Quoth I let me do this deed,
For he that will scorn
A Beggar-wench born
May want a good turn at need.
Then into her Arms I claps,
Quoth she now I Am in your traps,
what shall I do with scraps
Throw them in the bush said I,
No, no, she did straight reply
there is Pig, and Pudding and Pie
We beg for better or worse,
My blessings I will not curse,
Why then quoth I,
Go run presently,
And throw it a 'thwart my horse.
She then (in a merry vein)
Did trip to me back again,
to put me out of my pain,
She dazelled so my sight,
That neither by day or night,
I ever had such delight,
So close to me now she clings
And flutters abroad her wings,
But my bashful jade
Ashamed of the trade
Brake loose and away he flings.
I rise and away ran I,
The Beggar-wench then did cry,
my Pig and my Pudding and Pie
I ran and I cursed and swore,
Until I came to my door,
but the Horse was get home before
I bad the wench stay behind,
And told her I would be kind,
But when I came home
I looked like a Mome,
I wished that I had been blind.
My Wife and my neighbors all
Did laugh, ye might hear 'em bawl
from Temple Bar to White Hall,
my sweet-hearts provant was found
Which lay in the wallet bound,
and scattered about the ground,
The sight of my wife did daunt,
and make my heart prick and pant
Sir Thomas quoth she,
(And spoke merrily)
Where get you this good provant?
Thought I, it is best bear up,
Although of this venomous Cup,
I take but a sorrowful sup,
In the twinkling of ones eyes,
I thought of a thousand lies,
but nere a one would suffice;
I many things had in doubt,
Yet could not well bring 'em about,
As I went to begin
The wench came in,
And so came the story out.
My Lady did laugh outright,
As if she had much delight
But I found it not so at night;
I gave the poor-wench a pe^^e,
But wished she had been in Greece
to tell such a tale as this,
My Madam does make it slight,
But I have got nothing by it,
for when she wants of her wish
it is thrown in my dish,
I Would better been hanged outright,
FINIS.
