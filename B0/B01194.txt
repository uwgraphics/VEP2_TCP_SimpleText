As pleasant a dittie as your heart can wish, Showing what unkindness befell by a
Kiss.
MY Mistress sings none other song,
but still co^plains I do her wrong,
Believe her not it is not so:
For I did but kiss her,
For I did but kiss her
and so let her go
And now she swears I did: but what,
Nay, nay, I must not tell you that
And yet I will it is so sweet,
as teehe taha,
as teehe taha.
when lovers do mete.
But women's words they are heedles,
to tell you more it were needles
I ran and caught her by the arm,
and then I kissed her,
and then I kissed her,
was this any harm.
Yet out alas she is angry still
which shows but a woman's will
She bites the lip, and cries fie fie,
and kissing sweetly,
and kissing sweetly,
away she does fly.
Acteon for one sight did die,
so for one silly kiss must I:
Unawares fond love did me betray
When I gave her vantage
when I gave her vantage
and she fled away.
She striued and wrangled full sore with me
and cryedst for shame let it be
You do me wrong to use me so
Therefore be quiet,
Therefore be quiet
and now let me go.
Yet still I held her by the hand
her words could not my will wtstand
she fround, she pouted, she looked sower
and still I held her
and still I held her,
within my power.
At last she began for anger cry,
and then my heart with grief did die
I could no longer her contain.
But thus we parted
But thus we parted
unto my great pain.
And since when I with her do meet
with words unkind she does me greet
At me her wanton head she shakes.
and as a stranger
and as a stranger
my favors she takes.
But yet her looks bewrayes content
and cunningly her brawles are meant
As Lovers use to play and sport,
when time and leisure
when time and leisure,
is too too short.
Finis.
