The Unthankful Servant: OR, A Scolding Match between Two CRACKS of the TOWN,
Margery Merrythought, and Nancy her Mistress, who taught her her Trade. As they
happened to meet near the Piazza's in Covent Garden.
To the Tune of If Love's a sweet Passion.
Licensed according to Order.

^

I.
WEll met, my dear Sister, you're grown very strange,
For though every night through the City I range,
I have never beheld you this six Weeks or more;
Have you such a full Trade at your Beldams own door,
Without taking of pains for to walk too and fro?
It is well for you Margery, if it be so.
II.
Why Nancy what makes you discourse at this rate,
It is very well known, that I never want a Mate;
I have Lawyers, young Merchants, fine Sparks of the Town,
That I need not go slaving, and trudge up and down,
It Is enough for such threadbare poor Housewives as you,
To go cruising about for a Tester or two.
III.
You are but a Strumpet, your Friend to degrade,
Pray remember last Winter I learned you your Trade;
And although you have had greater Fortune than I,
Yet a Friend you have found me, you cannot deny;
When I took you with nothing both ragged and poor,
Nay, and lent you the Topping and Gown which you wore.
IV.
But Mistress, quoth Margery, be not so hot,
For the use of your Clothes, you had half what I got,
Which amounted sometimes to a Crown in a day;
Therefore I to my Grief did sufficiently pay
For the use of your Topping, black Patches and Fans,
And the best of my Work you took out of my hands.
V.
You are but a Hussy for telling me so,
They were none but my Quarterly Cullies you know;
Honest Thomas the Barber, and Robin the Cook;
Not a penny or farthing of Money I took;
But I trusted till they did their Wages receive,
And at this I was told, You did constantly grieve.
VI.
It Is false: pray remember the Counsellor's Clark,
Which I picked up my self near the Strand in the dark,
Then I brought him home, thinking no harm I declare,
I agreed for a Guinea, he liked my Ware:
But you ogled him up to your Chamber above;
Thus I lost a good Booty, a Pox of your Love.
VII.
The reason of that I will presently clear,
He had been my own Cully full three or four year;
He gives freely two Guineys, you bargained for one,
Now I then understanding straight what you had done,
I endeavored to get him from you in a trice,
I being resolved to keep up the Price.
VIII.
But how did you keep up the price, when you brought
Home a Tailor, who gave you no more than a Groat?
It is very well known I never wrought at that rate,
I would lie still a Month ever a penny I Would bate
Of a Guinea, and that shall be honestly paid,
It is such Jilts as you that have run down the Trade.
IX.
You see my rich Topping both gaudy and gay,
I am Coach'd from a Tavern, a Ball, or a Play;
Whilst you here in a Tawdry Dress walk the street,
And are glad of a 'Prentice, or whom you can meet;
I Will not spend my Breath on you, and therefore adieu
It Is a Scandal for me to stand talking to you.
FINIS.
