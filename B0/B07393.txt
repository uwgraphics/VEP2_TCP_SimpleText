Qu. How touching their ceremonies?

An. In the law their altar was made of stone: in the Gospel, our Altar is
Christ Jesus. Heb. 13.10. In the law they did sacrifice Calves, in the Gospel,
our sacrifice must be the calves of our lips, prayer and thanksgiving, Hebr.
13, 15. In the law they did circu^cise the foreskin, in the Gospel, we must
circumcise, and cut off the lewd affections of our hearts. Rom, 2, 29. In the
law, their Passover was alambe of the flock. Exodus. 124. In the Gospel our
Passover is the lamb Christ Jesus 1. Cor, 5, 7. in the law the Passover was
but the shadow of the thing: in the Gospel the Passover is the thing it
self.

Qu. How do they differ touching their teachers?

An. The publisher of the law was man, Moses: the publisher of the Gospel God
and man, Christ, The teachers of the law foretold the coming of Christ in the
flesh, Esaias. 7.14. The teachers of the Gospel foretell his coming in glory,

his Apostles.

Doctrine out of the Gospel after Matthew.
Question. What was Matthew by profession?

An. A publicane.

Qu Those kind of Jews which in the name of the Romans, did gather up the
taxes and tallages imposed upon the people.

Qu. How came he to be an Apostle?

An. Christ called him, as he was fitting at the receipt of custom, who
presently, notwithstanding the scandales and bad reports which the Jews had
given out of Christ, and that he himself was exceeding ritche, left all, and
followed him.

Qu. What does Matthew first set down?

An. The coming of Christ unto the world.

Qu. How is that?

Ans. Two manner of ways.

Qu. Which be they?

An. Once in the flesh: many times in the spirit.

Qu. How comes he in spirit?

An. Two manner of ways, by grace to inspire us, as when the spirit of God
fell upon the 70 Elders. Number. 11.25.26 And upon the Apostles Acts. 2.3.4 Or by
faith to assure, as Saint Paul faith, the same spirit bears witness with our
spirit that we are the children of God, Romans 8, 25, 26.

Qu. By what example do we learn, Christ's coming in the spirit?

An. By the example of Gods appearance to Eliah.

Qu. How was that?

An. First came a mighty wind, and tore the rocks, but God was not there: then
rose an earthquake, but God was not there, then came a fire, but god was not
there: at last came a soft and still wind, and God was not there. 1. Kings 19,
15.12.

Qu. Does Christ's spirit after the same manner descend into us?

An. Yes.

Qu. How?

An. First, there comes the breadth of his threatening voice, to break our
stony hearts, then an earth quake; that is, a trembling at his judgments,
Thirdly, a fire to try if we repent aright, Last of all, a soft voice of
happy tidings, which is the Lamb Christ Jesus.

Quest. How was his coming in the flesh?

An. He was conceived by the Holy Ghost and borne of the Virgin Mary, Matthew.
1.18.

Qu. Is this all the times he shall come in the flesh?

An. No, he shall come at the latter day.

Qu. In what manner?

An. With power and great glory. Math. 24.30.

Qu. What to do?

An. To judge the world with righteousness, and the people with equitye: that
is, to give to every one according to their deeds. Math, 16.27.

Qu Why did Christ take upon him our flesh?

An. To satisfy for our sins.

Qu. How?

An. In suffering underneath the justice of God, what we had deserned.

Qu. What was the first evil that Christ suffered?

An. Persecution.

Qu. When?

An. As soon as he was borne.

Qu. By whom?

An. By Herod king of the Jews.

Qu. What learn we by this?

An. That a christian life in this world from the day of our birth, to the
hour of our death, is nothing but crosses and afflictions.

Qu. How came Herod to be king?

An. He bought it of Caesar for a great sum of money.

Qu. How did he behave himself in the kingdom?

An. Like a bloody. Tyrant, he slew all that were of the lineage of king
David, and burnt their Pedigrees, because he feared to be driven from his
seat and authority by one which he heard should spring of that family, and
therefore likewise, he flew his sister, and her husband that was a Jew, and put
to death his own son which he had begot upon a Jewish woman.

Qu. How long was it ere he could seat himself in the kingdom?

Ans. Thirty years, continually making war upon the Jews: so hardly did
they endure the government o^ a stranger.

Qu. Why was Jerusalem troubled, when news was brought of the birth of a new^
king, which was Christ, knowing they were weary of the government of Herod?

An. First, to flatter him, because they would seem to be affected as he was
for he was greatly troubled. Matthew, 2.3. And secondly, because they feared
there would arise a new occasion of bloodshed, by the contention of these two
kings.

Qu. What was the end of Herod's malice toward Christ?

A. As it is of all persecutors of Gods people, his own ruin: for Christ was
delivered from his rage. Mat. 2.13.

Qu. Did his rage so end?

An. No, when he saw himself mocked of the Wise men that promised to bring
him word where Christ was, he most cruelly slaughtered all the young children
of Bethlehem, and the coasts thereaboutes, thinking so to be sure of his
destruction. Math. 2.16.

Qu. What do we learn by the massacre of so many innocents, Christ only
reserved?

An. That tyranny may destroy the body of Religion, but not the soul.

Qu. Was that no fault in the wisemen to break promise with Herod?

An. No, it is lawful to break promise in any thing, wherein the honor and
service of God may be hindered.

Qu. How was Christ preserved?

An. By flight into Egypt.

Qu. Why did Christ being God, give place to the fury of Herod?

Ans. To show that it is lawful for us to flee from persecution, and save our
lives: so it may be done without scandal to the Gospel. Mat: 10, 23.

Qu. Why did he flee into Egypt, rather then into any other country?

Ans. For 2. causes: first that the scripture might be fulfilled, according to
the prophet Ose, Out of Egypt have I called my Son: And secondly to show
that he would forsake the Jews for their ingratitude, and receive the
gentiles.

Q. Wherein consisted their ingratitude?

An. In stoning the Prophets and men of GOD, which were sent unto them for
their souls health, Mat. 23.37.

Qu. How does Christ prophecy their ingratitude should be punished?

An. By threatening unto them a spiritual and a corporal plague.

Qu. What was their spiritual plague?

An. Famine of the word and scarcity of teachers.

Qu. What was their corporal plague?

An. Ruin of their city, desolation of their Temple, and a general
dissipation and scattering of their whole nation: at whose hands shall be
required the blood of all the Saints, from Abel to Zachary the son of
Barachia, whom they slew between the Temple and the Altar.

Qu. How many were the henefites of God bestowed upon the Jews?

An. Innumerable: but these especially, he saved Noah from the flood: Abraham
from the Caldea^s: he brought the^ afterward out of Aegypte through the red
Sea, he fed them in the wilderness, with meat from heaven, and water from
the rock, forty years space their garments never waxed old: heeled them dry
shod over Jordan, he gave them possession of one and thirty kingdoms, he
instructed them in his true service: he built them a temple: he supplied them
daily with prophets to be their guides: and finally sent his only begotten
Son amongst them, to be a physician both of their bodies and souls, whom
they most cruelly put to death.

Qu. What did first make known the birth of Christ?

An. A star, Mat. 2.2.

Qu. How did that star differ from other stars?

An. In three respects: first, as touching the place, being lower fixed then
other stars: Secondly, as touching the motion, moving directly forward, and
not circularly: and thirdly, as touching the time, it shone as well by day as
by night.

Qu. To whom did the star appear?

An. To the wise men of the East, to conduct them where Christ was borne.

Qu. What is signified by that star?

An. The spirit of God, which must illuminate our hearts: or we shall never find
the way unto Christ.

Qu. When the wise men found Christ, what did they?

An. As all men must do, when they have once got the knowledge of him.

Qu. What is that?

An. Acknowledge our love and service to him by our external oblations.

Qu. What was their oblations?

Ans. Gold, frankincense and mirth: gold, as he was a King; frankincense as he
was a Priest; and myrrh, as he was a Prophet, Mat. 2.11.

Qu. But in stead of these three things, what do we Christians learn to offer
unto him?

Ans. For gold, purity of life; for frankincense, prayer and thanksgiving; and
for myrrh, patience in adversity.

Qu. In the eleventh chap. of this gospel, Christ says, I thank thee Father
that thou have hid the knowledge of thy will from the wise and prudent, and
have showed it unto babes: yet bear he says, the wise men came to worship him.
What difference is there betwixt the wise men he speaks of there, and those
mentioned here?

Ans. By the wisemen there, he understands such as arrogantly depend upon
their own knowledge, and measure all things by humane reason: By wisemen in
this place, he understands such wise men, as in things that belong to the
honor of God and our justification, reject the power and wisdom of man, and
cleave only to the grace of God through Christ, and the sincerity of his word.
In which sense they are also called babes, Matthew. 11, verse, 25.

Qu. In professing of Christ: what comfort have we?

An. A threefould comfort: first we know he is our Lord, and can and will
defend us from all our enemies. Matthew. 28, 18.20. Secondly he is our teacher,
and will instruct us in all things necessary to salvation. And thirdly, our
spiritual physician that calls us unto him, to comfort and heal our afflicted
consciences, Math, 11.28.

Qu. Where is the end of the Old Testament, and beginning of the new?

An. In the Baptism of Christ; for by that god does, as it were, point unto
us, and show that he is the true Messiah, and Savior of the world.

Qu. By what sign?

An. By the visible appearing of the holy ghost, and the voice that was heard:
This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Matthew. 3.17.

Qu. How many things are required in Baptism?

An. Three: the visible element (which is water), the word, and a promise of
grace.

Que. What was the difference between the baptism of John and the baptism of
Christ.

An. John did baptize with water to repentance, but Christ did baptize with
fire: that is, by his holy Spirit worcester. king in our hearts to the remission of
sins.

Qu. Why is John said to prepare the way of the Lord?

An. Because his doctrine was repentance, and no man can come unto Christ
except he first confess the damnable state he is in through sin, and be
heartily sorry for the same, faithfully believing only by the merits of Christ
to be delivered from thence.

Qu. Whom did Christ first call to his service?

An. Poor fishermen.

Qu. What do we learn by their calling?

An. Two things.

Qu. Whch be they?

An. First, an example of charity in Christ, that of his mere mercy and grace
chose such poor and simple men to be the chief Pastors and pillars of his
Church. Secondly, and example of faith and obedience in them, who no sooner
were called, but straightway left al they had, and followed Christ. Matthew.
4.22.

Qu. How did they follow him?

An. Not as many Christians now adays do, in outward show and seeming
holiness but with that resolution, that they willingly underwent poverty, scorn,
slander, and death itself, to show themselves worthy scholars of so worthy a
master. Besides they were but once called upon, and they came: but we are many
times exclaimed upon, and yet we come not.

Qu. How led Christ his desciples?

An. Two manner of ways, bodily, and spiritually.

Qu. How did he lead them bodily?

An. By iniuring his body to travel by sea, by land, in city, field,
mountain and valley, for the publishing of the gospel, and work of their
salvation.

Qu. How did helead them spiritually?

An. By manifesting unto them great signs and arguments of humility patience,
love, fortitude, and all other virtues of the mind: so that what he was, such
he would have them, and all that insist upon his holy name to be.

Qu. Why did not Christ choose his disciples amongst the mighty, learned, and
rich men of the world?

An. Because the mighty stand upon their reputation, the learned are obstinate
in their opinions: and the rich enthrald with covetousness

Qu. Was there none of this sort came, when Christ called them?

An. Yes. but they were very few: as of rich men Zacheus, and Matthew: of
gentlemen the Centurion and Joseph of Arimathea, and of the learned, Nichodemus
Gamaliel, Saul.

Qu. Did these men leave all, and follow Christ.

An. They did.

Qu. How then had Matthew a house to banquet Christ in after ward? Mat. 9.10

An. To forsake all, is understood, not clean to depart from all which they
had, but to make no reckoning of their goods, otherwise then they might serve
to the glory of God, and the relief of his poor distressed members.

Qu. Why does Christ call his Apostles and Ministers the salt of the earth?
Mat. 5.15.

An. Because as the property of salt is to bite, purge, and preserve: so their
doctrine ought to testify, reprove, and instruct.

Qu Why are they called the light of the world?

An. Because, in doctrine and conversation, they must be as shining and
glorious guides to the dark minds of the ignorant.

Qu. What is the end thereof?

An. The glory of God.

Qu. Is it not then enough for them to preach the Gospel openly, and with
boldness of heart?

Ans. No, they must likewise bring forth fruits of good life hy their deeds of
charity, Mat. 5.16.

our neighbor: and in sobernes that belongs to our selves.

An. For three causes: Iure creationis, because he created us: Iure
redemptionis, because he redeemed us: and iure amoris, because he loved us.

Qu. What are the branches to be handled in this Gospel?

An. The tempting of Christ, his fasting, prayer, and miracles.

Qu. When was Christ tempted?

An. As soon as he had received baptism. Whereby we learn that the spirit of
God begins no sooner to work, but it is as soon crossed and over th warted by
the spirit of the devil, chap. 1.12.

Qu. What is the difference bet ween these two spirits?

Ansvv. The spirit of God is loving, gentle, meek, not forcing. nor
threatening: the spirit of the devil is subtle, cruel, false, and full of
terror. Between these two spirits, the spirit of man is continually tossed,
the one working to our salvation, the other to our damnation.

Qu. Who did tempt Christ?

An Two sorts of creatures.

Qu. Which be they?

An. The devil and the Jews.

Qu. From whence fetches the devil his argument wherewith he tempreth?

proceed from God.

Qu. How does God use to tempt?

Answ. Two manner of ways: by trials on the right hand, and by trials on the
left.

Qu. How does he tempt us by trials, on the right hand?

An. By offering us temporal blessings, as wealth, promotion, and such like:
to if we will take hold on them justly, or after an indirect and sinful
manner. Or; by bestowing upon us teporall blessings, to try if we will dispose
of them according as he has commanded, and as his upright almoners.

Qu. How does he tempt us by trialls on the left?

An. By suffering heresies to rise up amongst us to see if they can seduce us
or by common corruption of manners, when many slanders, scandales, and injuries
are offered to prove our constancy patience and love.

Qu. How did the Jews tempt Christ?

An. By frivolous questions to entrap his life: as whither it were lawful to
give tribute to Caesar, or not. chapter 12.14.

Qu. What is our comfort in temptation?

An. That if we abide faithful and constant, God at the last, will send his
Angels to deliver us, as he did unto our Savior, chap. 1.13.

Qu. Why does God suffer us to he temted?

An. For five special reasons.

Qu. Which be they?

Ans. First to try whether we be faithful. Secondly to make us seek unto him
for help. Thirdly, the better to manifest his power and love in delivering us.
Fourthly to create in our hearts a thankfulness for our deliverance.

And fifthly that we may be made like unto our Savior Christ.

Qu. Is it in the devils power, to tempte us when be pleases?

Ans. No, he cannot do it; by the example where the unclean spirit which
Christ had cast out of the man in the country of the Gadarens, could not enter
so much, as into the heard of swine, before he had asked leave of Christ,
chap. 5.12.

Qu. What does this infer?

Ans. That we ought always to pray, that we be not led into evil temptation.

Qu. After Christ was delivered from the temptation of devil, what did he?

An. As we ought to do in the like case most cheerfully endeavored to perfor
me the will of his Father.

Qu. What may we therefore liken the temptation of the devil unto?

An. A blow, or w wound, which dismaies not the good christian, but rather
stirs him up mere forcibly to withstand the assault of his enemy.

Qu. What opportunity did the Devil watch to attempt Christ?

An. When he was alone in the wilderness, and oppressed with long fasting.

Qu. How long had he fasted?

An. Forty days and forty nights.

Qu. What company had he?

cursing, swearing, and evil speaking, our hearts from meditating mischief:
our hands from practicing unlawful actions, and our feet from treading in the
way of scorners.

Qu. What is the property of true fasting?

Ans. It must not be done for vaineglory, but to mortify the body: that it
may be in subjection to the spirit: and to the intent we may have the more
provision, for the relieuing of the poor.

Ans. Health, perfection of memory, sharpness of wit, long life, and
happiness of soul.

destruction of soul.

Qu. Where in consists intemperance?

Ans. Yes, if it be done with moderation and thanksgiving, as it appears by
the example of Matthew, who feasted our Savior Christ, chap. 2.15.

Qu. Whom must we feast?

An. Not our ritche neighbors, least they bid us again, and so recompense be
made: but the poor, maimed, lame, and blind, and God shall reward us at the

pardouing offenses?

An. Six.

Qu. Which be they?

An. First, who it is that must forgive every one, as well the King as the

all capital wrongs, whether sudden or premeditate. Thirdly, whom they be
we must forgive namely our Christian brother. Fourthly how often, not seven
times only, but seventy times seven. Fifthly in what sort, not fainedly, but
from the heart. Sixthly when, not at the Altar only, and when we pray, but at
all times when our brother shall seem to offend.

Qu. In how many points consists forgiveness?

An, In four.

Qu. Which be they?

An. Couniuere, to wink at our brothers offense, condonare to pardon the

life of man is nothing but a puff of wind. Some again, Because the loss of
much blood brings the loss of life therefore they esteem the life to be
nothing else but blood: And other some, because in death they perceive no
difference between men and beasts, therefore they hold our life to be as the
lives of brute beasts, vanishing without immortality of soul: but all these
opinions are cotrupt and lewd.

in the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides in him, chap.
3.36.

Qu. But Paul, as we read in the eight chap. persecuted the church, and
consented to the death of Steaue^, how came he then to be an Apostle?

An. The spirit of God (in whose hands are the hearts of all men) converted
him from a persecuter to a preacher, so that amongst all the Apostles, none was
more zealous, nor added more Souls to the Church, then he did.

An. By his painful travel through many countries, his stripes,
imprisonment, stoning, danger by land and Sea, which he joyfully suffered for
the love of Christ Jesus.

the world?

enemies more justly condemned, and his servants more worthy of their reward in
heaven.

otherwise, they that were not refused.

Qu. It appears then that faith is the only gift of God?

attended to the doctrine of Paul, chap. 16.14.

Qu. What strange conuersions were there made by the Apostles?

An. The conversion of the Ethiopian Eunuch, of Cornelius, of Eneas, and Paul's

so in nature?

to the benefyt of their brethren they kept back a part to their own private
use.

Qu. How were they punished?

Ansvv. With sudden death, chap. 5, 5 10.

Qu. If God showed such severity upon them in that they distributed not their
whole substance to the maintenance of christian charity: what ought they to
fear that will bestow nothing, not so much as the superfluity of thyer riches
to the releeuing of their distressed brethren?

An. Not only death of body in this world, but destruction of soul and body
in the world to come, unless they amend.

Qu. Wherein did Eutichus offend?

A. Being of the congregation of the faithful, as he sat with others to hear
Paul preach, neglected his doctrine, [as at many Sermons with us we may see
the like) and fell into a sleep.

Qu. How did God punish him?

An. He made him an example to the whole assembly, by suffering him to fall
from the third loft; so that he lay for dead, till Paul revived him.

no such danger?

of a greater fall.

Qu. What is that?

Saint Paul's Epistle to the Romans.

has not taken deep root,) might be shaken with contention and error.

thither?

An. Yes.

Qu. What was it?

An. The Jews began to despise the Gentiles, and the Gentiles the Jews.

An. They thought them unworthy to be partakers of grace through Christ,
because they were not under the Law alwell as they.

Qu. How did the Gentiles despise the Jews?

An. They thought them more unworthy of Gods favor through Christ, because they
had refused him for their Messiah, to whom only he was sent.

Qu. How does Paul take up this controversy

An. By proouing them both guilty of monstrous sins, and therefore unfit
either to reprove other.

Qu. Of what does he prove the gentiles guilty?

An. Of Idolatry: for though they had not the Law written, yet by the frame of
heaven and earth, they could not but know there was an omnipote^t God; and
therefore they ought not to have worshipped Idols, chap. 10.20.

Qu. What does he hold the Jews guilty of?

An. Of presumption in thinking they could be justified by the Law: so that
neither in the Law, nor out of the Law (that is before the Law was given) can
there be any righteousness.

Qu. What then must they depend upon for their justification.

A. Only faith in Christ Jesus, who had performed the Law for them: for to
hear the Law, was no cause of justification, but to perform the Law, which
none was able to do, but only the son of God, cha. 2, 13, and 3.20, 25.

Qu. How does Paul distinguish the Law.

An. Into the Law of the Letter, and the Law of faith.

circumcised; that he might not think circumcision cause of his justification,
chap. 4.10,

be saved if they believe.

Qu. Wherein?

An. In that, when we were yet his enemies, he gave his only begotten Son to
death.

Qu. How became we Gods enemies?

An. By the sin of Adam.

Qu. Whether was greater, the condemnation that came through the sin of Adam or
the justification that came through the righteousness of Christ?

Ans. The justification that came by the righteousness of Christ.

Qu. Why?

Ans. Because by one sin only, came damnation: but Christ by righteousness has
forgiven many sins; that is, not only the sin of Adam, whereto we are
guilty, but many other sins of our own, which we have since committed.

Qu. What brings us to the knowledge of sin?

An. The Law, for if we had not known lust, then the Law had not said Thou
shall not lust.

Qu. Then the more sin is manifested the more grace abounds?

An. It does.

Qu. May we therefore sin that grace may abound?

An. God forbid.

Qu. Why not?

An. Because when in baptism we are made partakers of grace, we die to sin,
and rise again to newnes of life. chap. 6.6.

Qu. How are the works of the spirit rewarded?

An. With eternal life, chapter 6, 1.3.

Quest. Are we all subject to death by the Law?

An. We are.

Qu. How then can the Law be good which is cause of much ill.

Ans. Yet the Law is holy and good, and ordained to give us us life, but that
sin working in us, alters the property of the Law, so that in stead of life,
we find death, chap. 7, 10.

Qu. How shall we avoid this danger?

An. By living after the spirit.

Qu. Who are they that live after the spirit?

An. Such as God in his foreknowledge has predestined thereunto, chap. 8.30.

Qu. Are all men predestinate to be saved?

Ans. No, some are made vessels of wrath to destruction, as othersome are
made vessels of mercy prepared for glory, chap. 9.15.

nor sword to separate us from Christ.

Qu. When are we separated from Christ?

An. When we do, or consent to do any thing contrary to his will.

Qu. Why must we endure any extremity rather then revolt from God?

An. Because the afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory which
shall be shown unto us in the life to come, chap 8.18.

Qu. Do we obtain that glory then by works?

An. No, but by the mercy of GOD only, yet works and the good motions of the
spirit testify to our consciences in the mean space, that such a reward is
laid up for us.

Qu. How are we put from that glory?

An. Only by our sins.

Qu. To whom was the covenant of this glory made?

An. To the Jews first, and then to the Gentiles.

Qu. How did the Jews lose it?

An. By thinking to become righteous by the Law.

Qu. How did the Gentiles obtain it?

An. By believing in Christ, so soon as they heard of his name, chapt. 9.30.

Qu. Why could not the Jews be righteous by the Law?

An. Because they could not fulfill the Law.

Qu. Are the Gentiles then righteous by fulfilling the Law?

An. They are.

Qu. How do they fulfill the Law?

An. Not in themselves, but in the work of Christ, who has fulfilled it for
them, and for all others that believe in him, so that his righteousness is
become theirs, chap. 10.4.9.

An. No, God has reserved a remna^t to be saved, chap. 9.27.

Qu. Are the Gentiles all accepted?

An. No, but only such as hear the word and believe.

Qu. But some have not heard the word, therefore they shall be excused?

An. Not so, the sound thereof is gone through the earth, therefore none can
plead ignorance, chap. 10.18.

Qu. Because we are Gentiles, and accepted by our belief in the place of the
unbelieving Jews, ought we to despise them in respect of our selves.

Ans. No.

Qu. Why?

An. Because we are not so accepted, but we may be rejected; nor they so
rejected, but they may be received: for if God grafted us into the true vine
which were but wild branches: much more may he grafft the Jews, which were
the true branches, into the true stock again; chap. 11.17.

Qu. Why does Saint Paul urge this similitude?

An. To shut up the contention between the Jews and the Gentiles, that
neither should despise other: because they were alike in belief, and unbelief.

Qu. After the deciding of this controversy, and certain principal points of
religion (as faith and justification) declared, wherein does Paul show we ought
to strive one to excel another?

An. In unity, and uprightness of life.

Qu. How is that to be performed?

An. By offering up our selves a lively sacrifice unto God.

Qu. What is a lively sacrifice?

Ans. To cut off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.

An. Not by the infusion of oil, but by the inspiration of the holy spirit.

Qu. When?

An. At our Baptism.

Qu. Do al Christians serve the office of Priesthood?

An. No.

Qu. Why?

An. Because their sacrifice is not such as it should be.

Qu. How comes that to pass?

An. By reason they prefer not sorrow before joy, death before life, rebuke
before honor, enemies before friends, for the love of Christ, and as he in his
life did for our example.

Qu. To whom is it given to do those things?

An. To all; but not after a like measure.

Qu. What must they do that have privilege of grace above others?

An. Not boast of it but help to furnish them that want. chap. 11, 3.

An. He was banished thither by the tyrant Domitian, about the year of our Lord
God 96. which tyrante sought to suppres the light of the Gospel: but the Lord
in mercy did the more advance it, as appears by adding a further discovery of

Qu. What is the fruit of this Revelation?

An. Exceeding great, as we may gather by these words, Blessed be they that
read, hear, and keep in memory, those things which are written in this
prophecy. chap. 1, 3.

Qu. To whom was John commanded to send it?

An. To the seven churches of Asia, namely, of Ephesus, Smirna, Pergamus,
Thiatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, where after the destruction of
Jerusalem, John did prosecute his holy calling in the Ministry.

Qu. What method does he use in the manner of his writing?

An. First, a friendly salutation, and then a brief narration.

Qu. How does he salute them?

An. By wishing unto them grace, and peace.

sake, although indeed we deserve it not but are in our selves the children of
wrath and perdition.

Qu. What by peace?

from this fountain of grace, which God the father had opened to the world by
the means of his son.

Qu. In whose name salutes he them?

An. In the name of the father, the 7. spirits, and of Jesus Christ. chap, 1.
4. 5.

Qu. What is meant by the 7 spirits?

Ans. The holy Ghost.

Qu. The holy Ghost being but one in person, why does he describe him by the
number of 7.

An. Although the holy Ghost be but one in divine essence, yet according to
this seven fold operation which it had in the Churches of Asia, it is called
by the name of seven spirits, not that it is in person diverse, but in power
and virtue, according to the diversity of those subjects which it works.

Qu. But why is that placed in the second place, whereas the usual order
teaches us to say, the Father Son and holy Ghost: and not the Father, Holy
Ghosts and so to put the Son last?

An. John uses this order, not that there is any degree or dignity in one
person more then in an other. For the Father is not greater then the Son, nor
the Son greater then the Holy Ghost: they are all of the same power majesty,
and glory, nor is one before another: but the reason that moved John to set
our Savior in the third place, was because immediately, the narration (which
is the second point of the writing) chiefly concerns Christ.

Qu. As how?

Ansvv. In describing him.

Qu. How does John describe Christ?

An. Two manner of ways: first, as touching the excellency of his glory, as
he appeared unto him in vision. cha. 1. from, 12. to 17.

Qu. What was his office?

An. It was three fold, he had the office of a Prophet, of a Prince, and of a
Priest.

Qu. How did he show himself a Prophet?

An. In bearing witness of the truth, and revealing the counsels of God unto
men.

Que. How a Prince?

An. Two manner of ways: first, by his victory over death: death is swallowed
up into victory. 1. Cor. 15: And secondly, because he has dominion over all
principalities and powers both in heaven and upon the earth, Ephesians. 1.21.

Qu. How a Priest.

An, In that he has washed us from our sins in his blood, by offering his
body a sacrifice for us upon the cross.

Qu. Did Christ hear these three offices only for himself?

An. No, for the benefit of the faithful, that as he was, so they might be
both Prophets, Kings, and Priests: Prophets, in that he says: I will power my
spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters shall prophecy, Kings,
in that we shall reign with him eternally, and Priests, for that true
Christians do offer the spiritual sacrifice of prayer, praise, and asmes
deeds. Hebr. 13.15.16.

Qu. Are then all Christian Priests alike?

An. They are, as touching the sacrifice above said, but not as touching
Church-gouernment, for in this sense they are not called Priests, but Elders,
or ministers

Qu. How does he describe Christ, according as he law him in vision?

An. By certain properties fit for the capacity of men: as that he was in a
long robe, girt with a girdle of gold, his hair was white as snow, his eyes as
a flame of fire, his feet like unto fine brass burning in a furnace, his
voice to the sound of many waters, in his right hand he had seven stars, out
of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and his face shone as the Sun
shines in his strength.

Qu. What gather we by this description?

An. By his long robe girt unto him, we gather the readiness of Christ; in
his Kingly and Princely office, to execute the work of our salvation: by his
white hair, his fullness of knowledge and wisdom; by his fiery eyes, his
deep insight into the darkest corners of the earth, and deepest secrets of
men's hearts: by his feet of shining brass, the purity and brightness of his
ways, and the power which he has to tread down his enemies, and therefore
are his feet, rather compared to Brass then unto gold, because gold is a
softer metal, and not so sit to represent his invincible strength. By his
voice compared to the noise of many waters, we understand the sound of the
Gospel, humbling some to their salvation, others to their confusion: By the
stars in his right hand, his faithful Ministers, by whom he works, which
as stars should give light unto men, by their doctrine and conversation: By
the two edged sword is understood, the powerful word of God, cutting and
cleansing the hearts of his children, and thrusting through the others to their
destruction: and by his face shining like the sun at the highest, the
unspeakable brightness of his grace, whereby the Church is comforted and
lightened in all truth and sincerity.

Qu. Why does he resemble the Churches to golden candlesticks?

An. Because the Candlestick does not give the light, but the light is put
upon it: so the Church receives all her light put upon her from Christ, for
the doctrine of the Church (which is the light of the Church) is from GOD, and
not of men.

Qu. Unto how many points may we draw the doctrine of this book?

Ans. Unto four.

Qu. Which be they?

An. Precepts, prophecies, promises, and threatenings.

Qu. Wherein are the precepts seen?

An. In the instructions given to the seven Churches.

Qu. Upon how many general points do these instructions consist?

An. Upon three, a commendation, a reprehension, and an exhortation.

Quest. What does Christ commend in them?

An. Their virtues, as patience, labor: zeal in the church of Ephesus, chapter 2,
2. The works of faith, repentance, and charity, together with constancy in
affliction and true humility in the Church of Smyrna, chap, 2.9. Fortitude and
valiant perseuera^ce in the church of Pergamus, that notwithstanding the
martyrdom of Antipas, a man there put to death for Religion, yet they were not
terrified, but held fast the faith of Jesus Christ, and never forsook it;
chap. 2, 13.

Love and service toward their brethren; faith and assurance in the promises of
God: and increasing in piety, so that the end was better then the beginning in
the church of Thyatira, chap 2, 19.
