ELEGY On the universaly Lamented Death of Mr. ALEXANDER SCHEILLs: An Eminent
Minister of the Gospel, who Departed this Life at Jamaica, in his Return from
CALEDONIA, 1700.
COme Muses nine, assist me to Lament
The loss of him, no danger could prevent,
From Carrying on the Cause of Christ his master
But Boldly did withstand every disaster,
Came in his way, and like to Noah's Dove,
He for the Ark of God bear such a Love
That to the Sole of's foot he found no rest
Until he found, the Delege overpast.
Would I had Argus eyes that Floods of Tears
Might flow from thence to dispell all our fears.
Heaven by this strock, seems our designs to blast,
Since he is gone, whilst life and strength did last,
All hazards venturd, Religion to premot
By's Life and Doctrine, where e're he sooting got;
That Heathen Infidels did aln often own
The Glorious Gospel (by him) to them shown,
To be more precious than all their Indian Gold,
As I have heard by Travelers often told.
Shall such an useful member of the Church
Fall by Deaths Dart and never on heart so much
As once be grived, nor any eye found weep
For loseing of a Shepherd of Christ's Sheep.
Who e're was faithful in feeding of his Flocks
And notwithstanding of what stumbling Blocks
Stood in his way, He tenderly them Led
And with sincere milk of the Word them Fed,
Wherefore He now is with immortal Rays,
Crowned, in those Mansions where his Master stays.
FINIS.
