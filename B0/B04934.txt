On that Devout, and Industrious GENTELMAN, GEORGE MONTEITH, Merchant in
Edinburgh, who departed this Life the 2. day of Juny, 1685.
A Funeral ELEGY.
DEvout and Precious Soul should I in verse,
Attempt they glorious virtues to rehearse,
It were a contradiction to express,
And bring to numbers what is numberless:
Verses must loss their feet, and Elegies
Give up their running to our melting eyes;
Yet reason says, that it can be no Crime
What we may speak in Prose to writ in Rhyme.
Witness the Sacrid Scriptures, it is no wrong
To vent a Lamentation in a Song.
So rational a grief who utters it,
At once both show's his sorrow, and his wit.
I Will not employ my Muse to chide stern death,
That with Blood-thirsty haste did cut thy breath,
When thou thy self did chide the fates delay,
Gasping from those sad times to be away.
Nor with Fantastic flight implore the spears,
To bath thy memory with us in tears.
While we believe that new Jerusalem
Where now thou art, Surmounts both us and them.
Thou now art infranchised, and at large,
And from our Wars death Seals thee a discharge.
Where clad in Robes of Immortality
Thour't levi'd with the glorious Hierarchy.
For here below thou were in each Estate
Humble, active, prudent, just, and temperat,
And with both actions and thy thoughts expense
Did keep thy Conscience still without offense.
Who knew thy virtues well, thy understood
Thou were an Angel clothed with flesh and blood.
Thy birth above the common level was,
Thy Nuptial types in honor did surpass.
Thou was not troubled with mad Midas itch,
Yet GOD did bliss thy store, and made thee rich.
Thou was a man of business, and yet,
To serve thy Maker was they chief delight.
Wherefore GOD takes thee home, where now thou sings
Grave, where is they conquest? death where are thy stings?
Dignum laud virum Musa vetat mori.

N. PATERSON.
