Cupids Conquest: OR, Will the Shepherd, and fair Kate of the Green; both
United together in Pure LOVE.
When Damsels Fair does thus Ensnare,
And win their Lovers heart,
Thus with a Frown can run him down.
Then Cupid takes his Part.
To the Tune of, As I went forth to take the Air: Or, My dearest dear and I
must part.
This may be Printed, R. L. S.





NOw'am I tossed on waves of Love,
here like a Ship that is under Sail,
No kind entreaties will not move
my Love to send one pleasant Gale.
She is an Angel in mine Eye,
and Beauty flows in every vein,
Yet I lie wounded fatally
and by the Dart of her Disdain.
The lusture of her Beauty bright,
has kindled such a secret flame
Within my breast, that day and night,
I needs must call upon her Name.
Fair Katee, Katee too unkind,
why am I Banished in Exile,
If thou will ease a grieved mind,
then send me here a gentle smile
Was she as kind as she was Fair,
she soon would send me some relief,
And case my mind of grief and care,
and vanish all the Clouds of grief.
But yet alas, it is in vain,
my Love she evermore defles,
Though I in sorrow here complain,
yet she resolved to Tyranize.






Assist me Cupid with thy aid,
and let me not be overthrown,
Do thou her gentle heart invade,
when she is silent all alone.
When her Enchanting eyes does close,
and all her senses are at rest,
When she is in her Night repose,
then seize the Closet of her breast.
Then Cupid took his Dart in hand,
not fearing then to make her yield,
He did not long disputing stand
e're he subdn'd and won the field.
When Katee fown'd her heart betrayed,
and yet no creature could she see,
She like a Pensive Lover said,
what sudden change is wrought in me.
Then many sighs and tears she spent,
it sorrow for her Dearest dear,
Her yielding heart did then relent,
sweet William O would thou were here.
Sure pride did over-sway my heart,
causing Ambition so to Reign,
But since I feel Loves fatal smart,
for sweet William I do complain.
Now when it plainly did appear,
that she in sorrows did condole,
This joyful tidings to his ear,
revived then his fainting Soul.
The vail of grief and heaviness,
no longer seemed to remain,
No tongue was able to express
the joys of her beloved Swain.
He then Embraced her in his arms,
and joyfully they did complete
The most indeared pleasant charms,
with vows and tender kisses sweet.
Thus many fair expressions past,
and Katee vowing thus did say.
As long as ever life does last,
i will be as constant as the day.
Printed for J. Deacon at the Angel in Guilt-Spur-Street, without Newgate.
