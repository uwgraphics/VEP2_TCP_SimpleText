UPON THE EXECUTION Of the Late Viscount STAFFORD.
I.
SHall every Jack and every Jill,
That rides in State up Holborn-Hill
By aid of Smithfield Rhymes defy
The Malice of Mortality?
And shall Lord Stafford dye forgot?
He that would needs be such a Sot,
To dye for love of a damned Plot?
No, Viscount, no; believe it not,
II.
Diana's Temple, all in flame,
Advanced the Incendiaries Name;
Ruffians, and Bauds, and Whores, and Theives,
In Ballad Records live new lives,
And shall a Lord because a Traitor,
In such an Age so given to flatter,
Want that which others, Saints to him,
Nere want to ^ame them* Words and Rhyme.
III.
Oh Sir, the Papishes, you know
Have much more gratitude then so;
For this same Lord that brake the Laws
Of God and Man, to serve their Cause,
Shall live in Prayers, and Almanacks
Beyond what Ballad-Monger make;
And some years hence, you will see, shall work
Such Miracles, would turn a Turk.
IV.
Blessed is that Man that has a Box
To save the Sawdust in, that sokes
His tainted Blood, or can besmeare
One corner of his Muckinder;
Oh! then, some Ages hence they will cry
Lo, Stafford's blood, and shed for why?
For notihng but because he sought
To kill his Prince, and sham the Plot.
V.
Now they that dye for crimes like these,
The Papists send to Heaven with ease.
For they secure 'em safe from Hell,
Which once believed, the rest is well.
A strange belief, that Men should think
That were not drunk with worse then Drink;
That such Rewards as Deifying,
By Treason should begain'd and Lying!
VI.
The Man that for Religion dies
Has nothing more before his Eyes,
But he that dies a Criminal
Dies with a load, and none can call
Religion that which makes him dream
Obduracy can hide his shame.
VII.
The Pope may do what he conjectures
As to the business of his Pictures,
The Colors nere can hide the Crimes,
Stories will read to after Times.
And twill be found 'the Hangmans hands,
Will strangely blur the Pope's commands.
VIII.
Had he but showed some Christmas Gambles,
And Headless took St Denis Rambles,
The Plot had been a damnable thing,
And down had gone the Scaffolding,
But cause his Lordship this forgot,
Men still believe there is a Plot.
IX.
Where was St. Dominic, a sleep?
Where did St Frank, his Kennel keep?
That on a business so emergen,
They did not briskly teize the Virgin?
To let his Lordship play a Prank
Her Grace becoming, and his Rank?
X.
But they that Heaven and Earth command,
You see sometimes they are at a stand;
For rruth to tell ye, should the Saints,
Be bound to hear all fool's complaints;
Their lives would be as void of mirth
In Heaven, as formerly on Earth.
XI.
Now Ballad-wise before he is dead,
To tell ye what the Sufferer said;
He both defended, and gainsaid,
Held up his hands and cried and prayed
And swore he nere was in the Plot,
No, by his Vicountship, God wot.
XII.
Come come, Sir, had it not been better
To have died to death common debtor?
And that upon your lasting Stone,
This Character had been alone?
Here lies a very Honest Lord,
True to his King, true to his word.
XIII.
But those, of your Religion,
Are now a days so damned high flown,
You think that nothing makes a Saint
But Plot refined, and Treason Quaint;
And Heaven accepts no Offerings,
But ruined Kingdoms, murdered Kings.
XIV.
Now you that knew who were his Judges,
Who found him Guilty without grudges,
Who gave him over to the Block,
And how he shamed to save the stroke,
If you believe the speech he made ye,
L'strange, and Payton's shame degrade ye
XV.
They used all Arts that could cajole,
You may be sure, his silly Soul;
And were those promises performed,
With which his conscience they had charmed,
Who would betray a cursed Plot,
To be when dead, the Lord knows what?
XVI.
But if those jolly Promises
Do send thee into little ease,
As certainly they must undo thee,
What ever Fools and Knaves said to thee;
Then Phlegeus-like in Hell condole,
And curse them that betrayed thy Soul.
XVII.
Now God preserve our Noble King,
And bless all them that thus did bring
Unto the Block that silly Head,
That cared not what it did or said.
And all good Men may Heaven defend,
From such a vile untimely End.
