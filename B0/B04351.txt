A Merry Wedding: OR, O Brave ARTHUR of BRADLY.
To a pleasant new Tune, etc.


SEe you not pierce the Piper,
His cheeks as big as a myter,
A piping among the Swain,
That dance on yonder plain,
Where Tib and Tom do trip it,
And Youths to the horn-pipe nip it,
With every one his carriage,
To go to yonder is marriage,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly,
O brave Arthur of Bradly,
When Arthur had got him a Lass,
A bonnier never was,
The chiefest Youths in the Parish,
Came dancing all in a morris,
Iumping with mickle pride,
And each his Wench by his side,
With Christmas gambals flouncing,
And Country Wenches trouncing,
They all were fine and gay,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly, etc.
And when that Arthur was married,
And his Wife home had carried,
The Youngers they did wait,
To help to carry up meat,
Francis carried the furmaty,
Michael carried the mince-pye,
Bartholomew Beef and mustard,
And Christopher carried the custard,
Thus every one in his array,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly, etc.
And when that dinner was ended,
The Maidens they were befriended,
For out steps Dick the Draper,
And he did strike up scraper,
I'ts best to be dancing a little,
And then to the tavern and tipple;
He called for a horn-pipe,
That went fine on the bag-pipe,
Then forward Piper and play,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly, etc.
Richard he did lead it,
And Margery did tread it,
Francis following then,
And after courteous Jane;
Thus every one after another,
As if they had been Sister and Brother,
That it was great joy to see,
How well they did agree,
And then they all did say,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly,
O brave Arthur of Bradly.
Then Miles in his motly breeches,
And he the Piper beseeches,
To play him haw-thorn-buds,
That he and his Wench might trudge;
But Lawrence liked not that,
No more did lusty Kate,
For she cried, Can thou not hit it,
To see how fine Thomas can trip it?
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly, etc.
When all the Swains did see,
This mirth and merry glee,
There Is never a Man did flinch,
But each one did kiss his Wench;
But Giles was greedy of gain,
For he would needs kiss twain;
Her Lover seeing that,
Did swap him over the pate,
That he had naught to shy,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly,
O brave Arthur of Bradly.
The Piper looked a side,
And there he spied the Bride,
And he thought it a hard chance,
That none would lead her a dance,
But none was there durst touch her,
Save only Bat the Butcher,
He took her out by the hand,
And he danced while he could stand,
The Bride was fine and gay,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly, etc.
Then out stepped Will the Weaver,
And he swore he would not leave her,
He hopp'd it all in one leg,
For the honor of his Pegg;
But Kester in his cambrick rust,
He took that all in a snuff,
For he against that day,
Had made himself fine and gay,
His ruff was whipped with blew,
And he cried out, A new dance a new,
Then strike up a round delay,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly,
Then 'gan the sun decline,
And every one thought it time
To go unto his home,
And leave the Bridegroom all alone:
Tut, tut, says lusty Ned,
I Will see them both in red,
For i will gi^ at a joint,
But i will have his codpis-poynt;
Then forward Piper and play,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly, etc.
And thus the day was spent,
And no Man homeward went,
There was such a crowding and thrusting,
That some were in danger of bursting,
To see them go to bed,
For all the skill they had,
He was got to his Bride,
And lay close to her side;
They got his points and his garters,
And cut then in pieces like Martyrs
And then they all did play,
For the honor of Arthur of Bradly,
O brave Arthur of Bradly.
Then Will and his Sweetheart,
Did call for, Loath to depart;
And then they did foot it and toss it,
Till the Cook brought the sack-posser
The Bride-pye was brought f^r^h,
A thing of mickle worth,
Then each at his bed's side,
Took leave of Arthur and his Bride,
And so went all away,
From the wedding of Arthur of Bradly,
O brave Arthur of Bradly.
