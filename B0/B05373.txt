At Edinburgh the fourth of March, 1643.
FOrsameikle as the Lords of His Majesty's privy Council of this Kingdom,
having, according to the offer made in Parliament, and particular Treaty agreed
upon with His Majesty and the Parliament (...) England, sent over to Ireland
the number of ten thousand men, for the defense of the Protestant Religion, for
His Majesty's service, and assistance of the Kingdom of England, in
suppressing the Popish Rebels there; And having daily advertisement of the
great necessities and wants of the Scots Army in Ireland, as well Officers as
Soldiers, who for want not only of their ordinar^ pay, but even of victuals in
the sparest measure, and clothes, and shoes, are redacted to that extremity,
that their bodies are daily decaying for want of necessary sustenance to uphold
nature, and are not able to endure any considerable time longer, unless speedy
and timous remeid be provided; The Christian consideration whereof not only
belongs to His Majesty's Privy Council in special, but to the whole Kingdom
also in general: And because the unhappy differences and distractions in
England are such, that the Parliament of England (which is obliged by the said
Treaty and capitulation for the monthly pay and entertainment of the said
Army) cannot so timely and plentifully provide victual and moneys for payment
of their arreares, or supply them for their present maintenance; Besides many
other inconveniences will arise, if they be not timously supplied with some
money and victual from this Kingdom: Therefore the Lords of His Majesty's
Privy Council according to their bound duty, and with concourse and consent
of the Lords and others Commissioners for conserving the peace, and
Commissioners for the common burdens, and they for themselves having at length
considered upon the best ways and means upon the borrowing of moneys, and
providing of victuals, clothes, and shoes to the said Army have resolved, and
have determined, that there shall be presently borrowed, for the use foresaid,
the sum of twenty thousand p^^^^^ sterling, and as much more or less as
shall be voluntarily offered betwixt and the first day of May next to come, by
Counselors Commissioners of Commissions foresaid, and every one of them who
are within this Kingdom, or by any others well affected (...); and to be paid
by them to William Thompson general Receiver and Commissioner of the said
Army, or to John Jossie Merchant in Edinburgh his depute in his absence: Upon
the delivery whereof to the said William Thompson, or his said depute, the
In-giver of the money shall receive a note subscribed by the said William, or
his said depute, granting the receipt of the same for the use foresaid, and
obliging them to hold count, and depurse the said moneys, as the said Lords
of Council, or any having warrant from them, shall appoint for the use
foresaid. The which note being shown to the Council, and registrate in their
books for a charge upon the receivers, the Lords of Council will give forth
and grant an Act of Council declaring the same to be lent for the use
foresaid; and which Act is hereby declared to be als valid as if the same were
done by the Council, with consent of the Quorums of both the said
Commissions. Likeas the said Lords of Privy Council, Commissioners for
conserving the peace, and Commissioners for the common burdens, do hereby
oblige them to cause the said sums (so to be lent) be thankfully paid and
delivered back again to the said persons, their heirs and assigns, betwixt
the date hereof and the Term of Whitsunday next to come in this instant year
of God 1643. Together with the ordinary annuall-rent from the date of the
lending of the same, so long as the whole or any part thereof shall remain
unpaid. And in case that moneys shall not come timously from the Parliament of
England to repay the said sums so to be lent, or any part thereof in due
time, The said Lords of Privy Council, with consent and concourse foresaids,
Declares, that the same, with annuals, shall remain as a public debt, due to
the said persons, lenders and advancers thereof, ay and while the repayment of
the same by the Parliament of England, or by some other common course to be
taken thereanent. Likeas the Lords of Privy Council, and the Lord General,
with consent of the Colonels present, and taking the burden on him for the said
Scots Army, do hereby hypothecate and assign for repayment of the moneys to
be lent as said is, the first and readiest of the sums of money due or to be
due to that Army by the Parliament of England; and ordains the same to be
employed proportionally for that effect: And declares that it shall not be
lawful to the said Commissioner, or his depute, to distribute any of the said
moneys without special warrant of the Council, but that he shall from time
to time, as he receives any moneys due to that Army, send a note thereof under
his hand to the Clerk of Council, to be registrate in the books of Council,
that the advancers may know the proportion of their repayment and relief: And
the said Lords of Council, with consent foresaid, do hereby desire every one
who will contribute their help and assistance to so good and charitable a work,
in so great a necessity, that they should be pleased to lend and advance such
sums of moneys as they shall think fit upon the like security and assurance
to be given them in manner foresaid: And ordaines these presents to be
registrate in the books of Council, Commissioners of peace, and Commissioners
for the common burdens; and to have the strength of an Act of the said
Judicatories jointly or severally: And declares that the double hereof, under
the hand of the Clerk of any of the said Judicatories, shall be a sufficient
intimation to the several Shires and Presbyteries to whom the same shall be
presented.
