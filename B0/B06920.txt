The Batchelor's Triumph: Or, The Single-Man's Happiness.
A Hen-peck'd Husband's like a Slave, who wears
His Masters Fetters, whom each whisper scares;
His thoughts are all to please his Wife, nor knows
He other Hell, then what her frowns disclose:
What Madmen then will be such fools, when they
Without control, may Love and Freedom sway.
To the Tune of, For what is Man, etc.
With Allowance.



FOr what is Man confined
Unto a Woman kind?
But a Slave, Cuckold, and Drudge;
that must work and toil,
whilst her Amors beguile,
And deprive him of what he gains:
but we will live a Single life,
and free from care and strife,
We tip their Fortunes for their pains.
Royot we all the day,
they bound and must obey,
Wives they will curb'um and make 'umgrow Sots;
But we are free from this,
Are not oblieg'd to Kiss,
Keep Ladies company just when we please:
Pass the whole Year away,
Merrily as the Day,
Revel like Princes with pleasure and ease.
Treated whole weeks are we,
they love Variety,
There Is not a woman but will have her friend;
Poor silly Idle Knaves,
their wives we make our slaves,
Court 'um to taverns, to Ball and to Plays;
Whilst the poor Fool at home,
Patient sits like a Moam.
What they want nightly we give 'um a day.


TAke Coach and to Hide-Park,
There Revel till it is dark,
Then with all speed the next tavern we find;
Whither we straight repair,
treated with sumptuous fare,
And whatsoever we want have at command:
Oysters and wine are free,
Or whatsoever we see,
Sil^ when we call for it is ready at hand.
Poor Husbands they know not,
their Money pays the Shot,
While that in Horns we return it again;
Ignorant of the case,
Whilst we their Foreheads grace,
And do adorn their Brows with a high Crest;
They Will not at Beer repine,
Whilst their wives feast with wine,
But think that all they do is for the best.
Whilst their Dames Rant and sing,
And close about us cling,
Panting long time we lie in loves embrace
For which their Gold they spend,
and what we asked 'um lend,
Free without Bond or scruple resign,
And empty all their store,
Let Husbands work for more,
Friends shall be surely supplied with their coin.
Whilst they keep on their pace,
And the Moams saddles grace,
Of what they possess there is noug^
then who would be Married,
Continually wearied,
When loves sweet accents so ple^
that Pastimes and Pleasures,
we take at our leasures,
And can abridge them when wea^
We live free from those cares
that a Husband still fears,
Frownings and poutings from (...)
till the fools Moneys give,
that they quiet may live,
Which on their Gallants so kind,
For the which we embrace,
And set Horns on their face,
Whilst the loved silver procures (...)
The poor Mopus confides,
And for Christening provides,
And by the Cradle a Rocking h^
Then let Sots be confined
Unto false women kind,
But we are resolved to Court sing (...)
And to pity his case,
Who with Hornny-fy'd face,
Slaves for his wife both by day (...)
