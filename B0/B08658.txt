THE CASE OF THE Old Governors of the FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL in BIRMINGHAM in the
County of WARWICK, Appellants, against a DECREE made in the Court of CHANCERY,
in the Name of the Attorney General, at the Relation of the New Governors.
KIng Edward the Sixth, 2 Die Januanriei Anno 5.
by his Letters Patent of that Date, erected a Free Grammar School in
Birmingham aforesaid, for the Benefit of the said Town, and thereby appointed
Twenty of the most discreet Inhabitants of the same Town, to be Governors of
the same School; whom he did thereby Incorporate: And by the same
Letters Patent granted to them and their Successors Lands to the Value of One
and twenty Pounds per An. for the Support of the said School: And gave them
Power to Elect a Schoolmaster and Usher, and New Governors, as often as any of
the Old should die or leave the said Town, (special Provision being made by the
said Letters Patent, That none but the Residing Inhabitants of that Town
should be capable of the Government.) And further, by the said Letters Patent
it was provided, That the Governors, by the Consent of the Lord Bishop of the
Diocese for the time being, should have Power to make Orders as well for the
Government of the said School, as for the Application of the Rents arising out
of the said Lands.

The successive Governors of the said School, ever since the Foundation
thereof, having taken great care to choose able Schoolmasters successively to
that Place, and having by their Industry and Prudence improved the Rents of the
said Lands, by Building and otherwise, from One and twenty Pounds per Annum, to
about Three hundred Pounds a Year; by means whereof this School has for several
Years last past been a great Nursery of Learning, and thereby a Public
Advantage to the Kingdom, which have been in a great measure occasioned by the
Encouragement some poor Scholars of that School received from the said
Governors, out of the improved Rents, by the Consent of the Bishop of the said
Diocese, toward their Maintenance at the University.

Which Methods continued until the latter end of the Reign of King Charles the
Second, at which time the then Secretaries Letter was brought by a Neighboring
Gentleman of that Country, directed to the Governors, purporting, That King
Charles the Second required a Surrender of their Charter; to which if they
complied, the Bearer told them, they might continue Governors, and have a new
Charter, with greater and more ample Privileges: But upon refusal, he also
told them what a severe Prosecution they must expect from his then Majesty; And
at the same instant prevailed with some of the most unwary Governors to join in
an Instrument for the Surrender of their Charter.

This Surrender was never Enrolled: But after King Charles's Death, in the
First Year of King James the Second, a New Charter was granted, wherein the
Person that brought the said Letter, and thereby procured the said Surrender,
is made a Governor, together with several other Persons of his Acquaintance,
inhabiting far distant from the said Town, and in other Counties, and not above
Five of the said Governors therein named are inhabiting within the Town: In
which last-granted Charter the King reserved a Power to himself of Removing or
Displacing any of the said Governors and Masters of the said School at his
Pleasure.

Upon this, the Old Schoolmaster is removed, although he had for many Years
together acquitted himself in an extraordinary manner in that Employment, and
greatly to the satisfaction of the Inhabitants, for whose Benefit the Charity
was designed, and a New Master brought thither in his room, against the
Good Will and Inclination of the Inhabitants of the said Town, whereby their
Children are neglected, and the poor Scholars are totally deprived of their
Subsistence and Exhibitions formerly received in the University.

The Inconveniency of which New Charter was soon felt in another manner, it
being totally in his then Majesty's Power; and the Town having generally a
great aversion to Popery, when not one Inch of Ground could be procured in that
Place, from any of the Inhabitants, to build a Popish Chapel on, for the
propagating that Religion, a long Lease is made of part of the School-Lands for
that purpose, and a Chapel erected accordingly on the same.

Thus stood the state of the School until Their present Majesty's (the Great
Restorers of our Ancient Liberties and Privileges) happy Accession to the
Crown; at which time the said Surrender not being Enrolled, your Petitioners,
the Old Governors, were advised to, and did act as formerly; and being
obstructed by the New Governors, they brought their Ejectment at Law, and did
recover therein; and thereupon the New Governors, immediately by Petition,
applied themselves to the then Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, for
liberty to Inroll the said Surrender, but were denied the same, upon hearing
Counsel on both sides: And thereupon the said New Governors Petitioned the
House of Commons, for leave to bring in a Bill, to be passed into an Act of
Parliament, for Settling the School upon the New Foundation; and the same was
referred to a Committee: Who, upon an Examination thereof, reported to the
House, That they saw no Cause to bring in a Bill; and the same was thereon
rejected.

That the New Governors, who are the Respondents, having met with these
Disappointments, then exhibited their Bill in Chancery, Trin. 16^9.
in the Name of the Attorney General, thereby praying the said Surrender might
be then Enrolled; which, upon the hearing of the Cause on the Tenth of July
last, the Court ordered accordingly; and that the Government of the said School
be settled under the said New Charter; and that the Governors thereby, and
their Successors, do quietly Hold and Exercise the said Government, under the
said New Charter, and dispose and order the Lands and Revenues thereto
belonging, against the Old Governors, and all Claiming under them, since the
Information Exhibited: And that an Injunction be Awarded, to prevent the Old
Governors from Trying their Right at Law, notwithstanding the said Inrollment.

From which Decree the Old Governors have Appealed to the Right Honorable the
House of Peers, for the Reversal thereof.
