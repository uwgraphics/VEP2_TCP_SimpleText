My Wife will be my master.
OR, The Married-Mans Complaint ^^ainst his Unruly Wife, being a warning for
all Unmarried persons, to have a special care in choosing their Maike, lest
they meet with such a Myre-^hype, as this poor-man did

To the Tune of A Taylour is no Man. Tune ^gis ^ most love thee
AS I was walking forth of late,
I heard a Man complaining,
With that I drew me near to him,
to know the cause and meaning
Of this his Sorrow, Pain and Grief,
which bred him such disaster;
Alace, quoth he, what shall I do
my Wife will be my Master.
If I should give her forty pound
within her Apron folding,
No longer then she telling on it
her tongue leaves never scolding:
As Aesop's Dog barkt at the Moon,
thinking for to distate her,
So does my Wife scold without cause,
and strives to be my Master.
Were I so strong as Hercules,
or wiser then Apollo;
Or had I Icarus wings to flee,
my Wife would after follow:
^r should I live as many Years
as never did king Nector,
^^t do I greatly stand in fear,
my Wife would be my Master.
(...) know no cause nor reason why
that she with me should jangle,
(...) never gave her cause at all
to make her with me wrangle:
(...) please her still in what I may,
and do no jot distate her;
^et she does strive both night and day
always to be my Master.
(...) every Morning make a fire.
all which is done to ease her,
I get a Nutmug, make a Tossed,
in hope therewith to please her:
With a cup of nappy Ale and Spice,
of which she is first taster,
And yet this cross-grained queen will scold
and strive to be my Master.
I wash the dishes, sweeps the house,
I dress the wholesome diet;
I humor her in every thing;
because I would be quiet:
O^ ^^ery several dish of meat
(...) (...)ly be first taster,
(...) I am glade to pick the bones.
she is so much my Master,
Sometimes she will sit while day be light,
in company with good fellows,
In Taverns and in bowsing Tents,
or in some pimping Alehouse,
And when she comes home drunk at night,
though I do not distate her,
She Will fling, she will throw, she will scratch, she will bite,
and strive to be my Master.
Her bed I made both soft and fine
and put on shoes completely;
Her shoes and stockings I pull off,
and lay her down most neatly;
I cover her and keep her warm,
for fear I should offend her,
I hug her kindly in my Arms,
yet still she will be my Master.
And when I am with her in Bed,
she does not use me well Sir.
She Will wring my Nose and pull my Ears,
a pitiful tale to tell Sir:
And when I am with her in Bed,
not meaning to molest her,
She Will kick me out at her Beds-feet
and so become my Master.
And thus you hear how cruelly
my Wife does still abuse me,
At Bed, at Board, at Noon, at Night,
she always does misuse me:
But if I were a lusty man,
and able for to baste her.
Then would I surely use a means,
that she should not be my Master.
You Batchelours that sweet hearts have,
when as you are a wooving,
Be sure you look before you leap,
for fear of your undoing:
The after Wit is not the best,
and he that weds in haste Sir,
May like to me bewail his case,
if his Wife do prove his Master.
You married Men that have good wives,
I pray you make much of them,
For they more precious are then gold,
if once you come to try them:
A good Wife makes a Husband glade,
then let him not offend her;
But a Scold will make a man run mad.
if once she prove his Master.
FINIS.
