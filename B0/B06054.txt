To a New Scoth Tune of Mr. Farmers.

WHen cold Winter Storms were past,
And every Mead with Flowers was graced,
My Jockey then as fine as May,
With Bonnet cock't up, and a feather so gay,
Each day came to me,
To Cog, Lie, and Sue me,
To flatter and Woo me,
But I, alas! believed to soon,
And at last found him to be a false Loon,
To my sorrow.
(2)
Early when the God of Day,
Had just in the Eastern Skies made way,
Then Jockey came to my Bedside,
Wolt gang tull a Kirk, says he, and be my bride?
I answered Marry,
Ise not ready for ye,
Ise mean for to tarry,
And first for our Wedding provide;
Then Wed with Jockey, and lig by his side,
To delight him.
(3)
On my breast he leaned his head,
And thurst down his hand into the bed,
Then I cried out, O fee, O fee,
Thou art sike a Loon as I never did see,
My bonny Jockey,
I never yet took ye,
To be so Unlucky,
To hurt the Lass you love so well;
Who never beneath a bonny Lad fell
In my life, Sir.
(4)
Ise got in a good merry Mude,
He thought it was time then to be Rude;
He kindly stroakt my Downy Wem,
And farther proceeded, O then, O then,
I cried, nay, look ye,
Nay, prithee now Jockey,
Be not so Unlucky,
For after you will not abide.
To take sike a bonny Lass to your Bride,
I am sure on it.
(5)
When my Jockey the Deed had done,
He rose from the Bed and would have been gone,
I caught him by the Breeks, and asked him to wed
It Is Marriage enough, says he, for as to Bed;
And so did he leave me,
Which greatly did grieve me,
He thus should deceive me;
And then quit his Courtship so soon;
But if I trust like another false Loon,
Deel take me.
(6)
Bonny Lasses all take care,
No Lads ever delude ye into sike a Snare:
For if they once creep into your Bed,
You never must after expect them to Wed;
What words they scatter,
They never make matter,
It Is only to flatter,
For when the Loon his Will has had,
You may look out for another sike Lad,
For he will leave you.
