The Courageous Loyalists, Or, A Health to the Royal Family.
To the Tune of, Rowze up Great Monarch.
^ Drowned Melancholy
in a Glass of Wine,
We will be Jolly,
let the Miser pine:
Boys Drink about,
we will make the Tavern Roar,
When the Bumper's out,
we will call again for more;
It makes good Blood
to run within our Veins,
It puts Good Reason also
in our Brains:
He that will deny it,
hanged let him be,
Here Is a Health to all
the Royal Progeny.
II.
Boys we will be merry
whatsoever ensue,
Drink Sack and Sherry
till the Sky looks blue;
Let the Whiggs lament,
and whiningly complain,
We with one consent,
drink to the Royal Train:
Heavens bless Great Charles,
and the Duke of York,
All the Lords and Earls,
and every Royal Spark;
Down with every Factious,
flamming, whining Crew,
Give them Rope and Hanging,
since it is their due.
III.
Drawer bring us Wine,
fill the other Bowl,
Let us lose no time,
for he is an honest Soul
That does love his Prince,
and the ancient Laws,
He is a man of sense,
he shall have our applause:
As for mighty Charles,
his Renowned Name,
Let it be Recorded
in the Books of Fame:
But he that will deny
Allegiance to the King,
Hang him let him dye,
and in a Halter swing:
Brave Noble Sions,
be you stout and true,
Stand in Defiance
of the Rabble Crew;
They that designed
our Laws to undermine,
We will make them fly,
like Chaff before the Wind:
Those that did consent,
yielding to allow,
Those that did invent
the Association Vow,
To conceal their Treason,
hang 'um let them swing,
Here Is a Health to Charles,
the most Renowned King.
V.
Now sure the Whiggs,
they will no more Rebel,
Old Crumwels Piggs
that sucked up all the swell:
Their hopes are drowned,
as we plainly see,
Some were confounded
in their Villainy:
Tommy he is fled,
Tony he is Dead,
Some of them was Hanged,
others lost their Head:
Ketch in conclusion,
paid them their Arrears,
Since this Confusion
how they hang their Ears!
VI.
Then learn to bow,
and in Obedience stand,
To Ceasar now
the Glory of the Land:
None can convince,
for what I speak is true,
He is a Prince
of love and pity too:
Those that are Loyal,
they are perfect free,
There Is no denial
of their Liberty:
Then true hearts be merry,
make the Tavern Ring,
Fling up your Caps,
and cry,
God Save the KING.
