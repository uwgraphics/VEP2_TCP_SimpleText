ane new ballet set out be ane Fugitive Scottisman that fled out of Paris at
this lait Murder.
NOw Katherine de Medicis hes maid sic a Gyis
To tarry in Paris the Papists ar tykit
At Bastianes brydell howbeit scho denyis
Give Mary slew Hary, it was not vnlykit
it a man is nane respectand this number
I'dar not say women hes wit of this cummer.
one Mask the Queen mother hes maid them in France
Was maikles and saikles, and schamfully slane
Bot Mary conuoyit and come with ane dance
Quhill Princes in Senses was fyrit with ane trane
Both tressonabill murtheris, the ane and the other
I go not in Masking mair with the Queen Mother.
Italianes ar Tyranis, and tressonabill Tratoris:
For gysours deuysours, the Guysianis ar good
Bot French men ar true men, and not of their natouris
Than Charlie I farlie thou drank thy awin blude
I wit bot thy Mother wit, women ar vane
In greis neir to Ganelon nor grit Charlie Mane.
Thy style was Treschristien may Christian King
Both hiest and friest, and neist the Impyre
Bot now Prouest Marschell in playing this spring
And ressoun for tressoun prouokis God to Ire
Beleuis thou this trumprie sall stablische thy style?
Our God is not deid it, be doand ane quhyle.
Suppois that the Papists deuysit this at Trent
To ding us and bring us with money loud lauchter
With sic cruel Murder is Christ sa content
To take the and make the ane Sanct for our slauchter
Albeit he correct us, and scurge us in Ire
Be war with the wand syne he wapis in the fire.
For better is pure men nor Princes periurit
Both schameles and fameles, we find them sa falls
With sangis like the Seryne our lyfis thou allurit
Ouirsylit us begylit us with baitis in our hals
Or as the false Fowler his fang for to get,
Deuoiris the pure volatill he wylis to the net.
In Ilis nor in Orknay, in Ireland Oneill
They dar not, they gar not, their liegis be stickit
Solomon, Tamerlan, nor yet the mekle Deill
Proud Pharao, nor Nero, was never sa wickit
Nouther Turk nor Infidel vsis sic thing
As be their awin burreo, being ane King.
Both auld men and women, with babis on their breist
Not luking nor huking, to hurll them in Sane
All beand murdreist down, quhat do e neist
Processioun, Confession, and up Mes agane
Proud King Antiochus was sum time als haly
And yet our God guschit out the guttis of his belly
Thy Sister thou maryit, thy Saces was sour
Sic cuikrie for luikrie was evil Interprisit
e maid us the Reid Freiris, and raise in an hour
Abhorring na gorring that micht be deuisit
Thou playit the false Hypocreit feneing the fray
But inwart ane rageing wolf waitand thy pray.
That France was confidderat with Scotland I grant,
Both actit, contractit, and keipit in deid
The kyndnes of Cutthrottis, we cure not to want
Denyis them, defyis them, and all their falls seid
It was bot with honest men we maid the band
And thou hes left leifand bot few in that land.
Our faith is not warldly we feir not thy braulis
Thocht hangmen ouirgang men, for gaddaring our geir
e kill bot the Carcass, e get not our Saulis
Not douting our shouting is hard in Goddis eir
The same God from Pharo defendit his pepill
And not one round Robene that standis in our stepill.
Now wise Queen Elizabeth luik to your self
Dispite them, and write them, ane bill of defyance
The papistis and Spanards, hes partit our pelf
As newly and trewly was tald me their tythance
Believe they to land heir, and get us fornocht
Will e do as we do, it salbe deir bocht.
Give pleis God we gre sa, and hald us togidder
Both surely and sturely, and stoutly gainstand them
They culd not weill conqueis us, culd e considder
For our men are dour men, and likis weill to land them
Quhen Caesar him self was chaist, have e foret
And both the Realms be aggreit, tak that they get.
For better it is to fecht it, defendant our lyfis
With speir men and weir men, and ventour our sellis
Nor for to se french men deflorand our wyfis
Displace us, and chase us, as they have done ellis
I mean quhen the Inglismen helpit at Leith
And gart them gang hame agane spyte of their teith.
I cannot trow firmly that Frenchmen ar cummen
Persayfand them haifand, them selfis into parrell
The Lord save Elizabeth, their ane good woman
That cauldly and bauldly, debait will our quarrel
With men and with money, both Armor and graith
As scho hes befoir time defendit this Faith.
Thocht France for their falset be drownit in da^geris
For causis and pausis they plait into Pareis
it ^e ar in war estait waitand on strangeris
No^ gyding deuyding, our awin men from Mareis
Go weid the calf from the corn, calk me their dures
And slay or e be slane, gif sic thing occures.
Bot how can e traist them, that trumpit ow ellis
Decoir them, do for them, or foster their seid
And they may anis se their time, tent to our sellis
Both haitfull, dissaitfull, e deill with in deid
Anis wod and ay the war, with quhat e do
And make them fast in the ruit gif they cum to.
God blis ow my brether, and biddis ow gudnicht
Obey God, go say God, with prayer and fasting
Christ keip thie pure I Will of ouris in the auld rihct
Defend us and send us, the life Everlasting
The Lord send us quyetnes, and keip our oung king
The Queen of Inglands Majesty, and lang mot yai Ring.
Quod Simpell.
