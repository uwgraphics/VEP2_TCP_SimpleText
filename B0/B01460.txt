Away vvith't Quoth VVashington, OR, THE PHANATICK GENERAL Vindicated over the
left Shoulder.
GEntlemen, stand to your Arms
In Wars the valiant proves most free from harms,
The Rear's no more secure then is the Van,
Death meets not always with the formest man,
What will become of me else that now dare,
^ead the Front, and fall into the Rear,
When I behold that Englisby my foe,
Will no ways yield to let my Lordship go.
I Am like Commanders that can well endure,
The Guns to quarrel, and themselves secure;
Or fain would purchase Honor if they durst,
He that Commands indeed should be the first,
We are the ground be set
With Henbane, Hemlock and deadly Aconet,
My wor^s away with it would you know the cause
It comprehends few of the Martial Laws,
Let not a Soldier that bears a Gun
having received his weekly pay to run,
Away with it
For fear the Martial Armed with Death
(That cruel Foe) does take his breath,
Away with it
And let the Soldier (though I know)
Take's Landlords money or Plate and go
Away with it
Or if a Soldier from the grass,
Steal sheep or Ox, I Will let him pass
Away with it
Nay Soldiers if you know a Town,
That is obedient to the Crown
Away with it
Money, Plate what e're you know,
I Will bid you strait with speed to go
Away with it
Musket, Bullet, Powder, March,
I Will say no more, but quick dispatch,
Away with it
Linen, Woollen, Swords or Knives,
Cavaliers, their Maids or Wives,
Away with it.
For it is no more but summum jus
To plunder those Sequester us,
Away with it.
Span up your Wagons when you have done
To Ege-hill every Mothers son
Away with it.
Methinks my Lordship would not care
If I had Guns and Powder there,
Away with it.
My Horse I looked for out of Kent,
I sure do think the Devil went
Away with it.
And in the North I Force had some
Had the Blind Cobbler sped to come,
Away with it.
Had Okeys men with him come to,
You could not fear but I would go
Away with it
For now we have the work begun,
If we do fail, our Foes will run
Away with it.
We have a party still behind,
Sir James will come when Pluto's blind
Away with it,
Nolls Instrument did heavy fall,
It was so long he swept us all
Away with it
Lo Engoldsby does come, and I
Think vain to stand, we would better fly
Away with it.
We will not fight, or shoot a Gun,
You Would rather eat I know, we will run
Away etc.
I Will rather yield for if I stand,
They I take my life, if not my Land
Away etc.
And now me thinks I am in pain,
Here comes his Troop I shall be taken
Away with it
For sure I must into the Tower,
He Will take my life, and so my power
Away with it
The thing I do desire is all,
Our party may to Portugal
Away with it.
If that wont stand, no help we shall
Have for our Cause, but needs must fall
Away with it.
If Law bring us before a Judge
For Treason then we needs must trudge
Away etc.
They say Phanaticks whistle Treason,
But since our Cause does smell of reason
Away etc.
Our Cause is dead, our means is small
Our hopes is less, We needs must fall
Away with it
But if we stay to act our part
Here, in a Pulpit called a Cart
Away etc.
Yet since the people cry a King,
I fear at Tiburn we shall swing
Away with it.
FINIS.
