THE CAREFUL Wife's Good Counsel: OR, THE Husband's firm Resolution to Reform
his Life, and to lay up something against a Rainy Day.
To the Tune of The Spinning-Wheel.
Licensed according to Order.





KInd Husband, if you mean to thrive,
Some other Ways you must contrive,
And not consume and wast your store,
It will be hard to work for more;
Therefore be ruled by me I pray,
save something for a rainy day.
I in thy Yoke will draw with you,
And what I can will freely do,
If you the like will do again,
Our Charge I Am sure we may maintain;
Thus by our Labor then we may
save something for a rainy day.
Behold! we see the painful Be
Lays up, by his Industry,
A Stock, to serve in Winter Cold,
And so should Man against he grows Old;
And therefore kind Husband now I pray,
lay up against a rainy day.




If Man has nothing of his own,
Alas! he then may make his moan,
And yet at length be never the near,
For Friends like Strangers will appear,
When as you fall unto decay:
Remember then the rainy day.
The Ale-wives they go fine and gay,
Decked in their Silks and rich Array,
When as the poor Man's Wife may lack
Both Food and Clothing to her back:
Good Man consider this I pray,
Save something for a rainy day.
The Hostess she will flout at thee,
And any one in Misery,
When as they can no longer spend,
She Will show no pity, give, or lend,
Consider this without delay,
Save something for a rainy day.
Your jovial boon Companions too
Will likewise take their leave of you,
They Will know you not in Time of Need,
And will not this make your Heart to bleed?
Therefore take up in time, I pray,
Save something for a rainy day.
He that shall wast his youthful strength,
And bring himself to Want, at length,
When feeble Age his Limbs shall seize,
And he has naught to take his ease,
Will find the World as cold as Clay,
then think upon the rainy day.
Gray Headed Men are often seen
Here in this World both poor and mean,
Having scarce Meat or Clothes to wear,
And this has been for want of care:
O think of this good Man I pray,
lay up against a rainy day.
Consider, we are Man and Wife,
And ought to lead a careful Life,
I Will do my best to get and save,
That we another Day may have
Something to help Old Age I say,
it is that I call a rainy day.

O loving Wife he then replied,
I will endeavor to provide
Henceforth for our poor Family,
Thy Words have so prevailed on me;
No longer will I run astray,
but think upon the rainy day.
I needs must own thy Words are true,
Therefore I will my Life renew,
And all my feigned Friends forsake,
Noy, likewise better Courses take;
Va longer will I run astray,
but lay up for a rainy day.
With Care I Will follow my Concerns,
That Man goes far that never returns,
I do resolve to mend my Ways,
And hope to see brave Golden Days,
And that we both may happy be,
And live in Love and Unity.
