The Hasty Bridegroom. OR, The rarest sport that has been tried, Between a
lusty Bridegroom and his Bride.
To the Tune of, Bass his Carrier or, Bow-Bells.
woodcut of a man and woman seated on a bed

COme from the Temple away to the Bed,
as the Merchant transports some his treasure
Be not so coy Lady since we are wed,
it is no sin to take of the pleasure.
then come let us be
blithe merry and free,
Upon my life all the waiters are gone,
and it is so,
that they know,
where you go,
say not so,
For I mean to make bold with my own
What is it to me though our hands joined be;
if our bodies be still kept asunder,
Shall it be said, there goes a married Maid,
indeed we will have no such wonder;
therefore lets embrace,
there is none sees thy face,
The Bride-Maids that waited are gone;
none can spy,
how you lie,
never deny,
but say I,
For I mean to make bold with my own.
Then come let us kiss, and taste of that bliss,
which brave Lords and Ladies enjoyed;
If Maidens should be of the humor of thee;
Generations would soon be destroyed;
then where were these joys,
the Girls and the Boys,
Would live in the World all alone,
don't destroy,
but enjoy,
seem not coy,
for a toy:
For indeed I Will make bold with my own.
SWeet love do not frown, but pull off thy gown
it is a Garment unfit for the night,
Some say that black has a relishing smack,
I had rather be dealing in white,
then be not afraid,
for you are not betrayed,
Since we are together alone,
I invite
you this night,
to do right,
my delight,
Is forthwith to make use of my own.
Prithee begin, don't delay, but unpin,
for my humor I cannot prevent it,
You are strait laced, and your Gorgets so fast,
undo it, or I straight will rend it,
or to end all the strife,
I Will cut it with my knife,
It Is too long to stay till it is undone,
Let thy waste,
Be unlac'd,
And in haste,
Be embraced,
For I do long to make bold with my own.
Feel with your hand, how you make me stand,
even ready to starve in the cold,
Oh why should thou be, so hard-hearted to me,
that loves thee more dear than gold,
And as thou have been.
Like fair Venus the Queen,
Most pleasant in thy parts every one,
let me find,
that thy mind
Is inclined,
to be kind,
So that I may make bold with my own.
As thou are fair, and more sweet than the air,
that dallies on Iuly's brave Roses:
Now let me be, to that Gardens key,
that the flowers of Virgins incloses,
and I will not be,
too rough unto thee,
For my nature unto boldness is prone,
Do no less,
then undress,
and unlace,
all a pace,
For this night I Will make use with my own,
When I have found thee temperate and sound,
thy sweet breast I will make for my Pillow,
It Is pity that we which newly Marries be,
should be forced to weer the green Willow,
We shall be blessed,
and live sweetly at rest,
Now we are united in one;
With content,
And consent,
I am bent,
My intent,
Is this Night to make bold with my own.
The Ladies loving reply.
WElcome dear love, all the powers above,
are well pleased at our happy meeting,
The Heavens have decreed, and the Earth (...) agreed,
that I should embrace my own sweeting,
at bed and at board,
both in deed and in word,
My affection to thee shall be shown:
Thou are mine,
I am thine,
Let us join,
And combine,
I Will not bar thee from what is thy own.
Out Bride-beds made, thou shall be my comrade,
for to lodge in my arms all the night,
Where thou shall enjoy, being free from annoy;
all the sports wherein love takes delight,
Out Mirth shall be crowned,
and our triumph renowned,
Then Sweetheart let thy valor be shown,
Take thy fill,
Do thy will,
Use thy skill,
Welcome still,
Why should thou not make bold with thy won.
The Bridegroom and Bride, with much joy on each side,
then together to bed they did go,
But what they did there, I did neither see nor hear,
nor I do not desire to know,
But by Cupids aid.
They being well laid,
They made sport by themselves all alone,
Being placed,
And unlac'd,
He unceas'd,
She embraced,
Then he stoutly made bold with his own.
