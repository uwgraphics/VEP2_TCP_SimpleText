PAUL HOOD, Doctor of Divinity, Rector of Lincoln College, and
Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford, to all whom it may concern,
Greeting. Whereas the Statutes of the University require certain
Scholasticall, and decent Habits, befitting every Person in his several Degree
to be used, and put on, when he shall appear in Public, especially at Sermons
and other Scholastical Exercises. And whereas for diverse years last past, there
has been almost a total neglect, throughout the whole University herein,
contrary to the Statues, and good Discipline of the same. We therefore
(considering the dishonor that may redound to the University, by this apparent
neglect; and that many inconveniences may ensue thereupon, if We shall not with
all severity uphold that Laudable Use and Custom) do Peremptorily, and
expressly Require and Command Every Graduate to appear in his Formalities, at
Sermons, and elsewhere, according to the Statutes therein provided. As also
Under Graduates to wear such Gowns and Caps, as are limited, and expressed for
their condition. And that these commands may work the speedier redress; We
profess to Execute the rigor of the Statues upon such as shall offend therein.

Given under my Hand this Eight day of October 1660. PAUL HOOD, Vice-Chan.
