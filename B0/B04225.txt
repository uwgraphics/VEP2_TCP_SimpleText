The Loves of Jockey and Jenny: OR, The Scotch Wedding. A most pleasant New
Song.




AH! Jenny Gin, your Eyn do kill,
you will let me tell my pain;
Guide Faith Ise loved against my will,
but would not break my Chain:
I eance was called a bonny Lad,
till that fair face of yours,
Betrayed the freedom once I had,
and all my blither hours.
And now, wey's me like winter looks,
my fa^ed showring ey'n;
And on the banks of shaddowing Brooks,
I pass the tedious time:
I Will call the streams that glide soft on,
to witness if they see,
On all the banks they glide along,
so true a swain as me.
Jockey. Wey's me, can Jenny doubt my love,
when au the Lasses see,
That I done flight each mikle Dove,
and languish but for thee?
I'se have Five Acres of good Land,
both Sheep and muckle Kine;
And au for Jenny to Command,
sweet Jenny then be mine.







Jenny. Wey's me when Jockey hens my store
he is will repent his pain;
And au his mickle suit give over,
poor Jenny he will disdain,

Jockey. Now by this blasted Oak I swear,
I'se cannot choose but moan:
Does Jenny think I'se love for Geer,
ne it is her self alone.

Ise have a pail to milk the Ews,
two Dishes and four Spoon;
Besides Cheese-Fats the Curds to scrue
a Pat and two new Shoon:
A Ladle, Spit and Dripping-Pan,
two Stools and one Straw-Bed;
On which poor Jockey wad full fain
get Jennys Maidenhead.
Jenny Nay if mine Jockey be so stored,
we's ne no more to buy;
Geud faith I'se have a muckle hoard,
that will the rest supply:
I'se have two Cheeses made of whey,
a Pudding Tub and Pan;
To fry Tripe on the Wadding-day,
if Jockey be the Man.

Geud faith, since Jenny's pleased to bless
her Lovesick humble Swain;
I'se by this shade do now profess,
I'se constant will remain:
Yea, byth agreement now I'se swear,
I'se auways loving prove:
So that each Lass shall envy her,
to see how well I'se love.
If Jockeys Riches will not do,
thy Jenny will not fail,
To take her Kettle and go Brew
a cragg of Nappy Ale:
A strike of Malt with pain and care,
well Houswiv'd may do well;
It Is stock enough for we poor Folk,
that Brew good Ale to sell.
Jenny. Then let us gang to muckle John,
that he may tie the Knot;
That I your joys may hasten on,
sin, it is kind Jockeys Lot:
With au his heart Jockey will gang,
and happy shall he be:
To hugg his Jenny au night long,
in mickle mirth and glee.

Then good sir, Donkin, by your leave,
a Wadding we mun have;
Do see the Skippets and Belloons,
with Lads and Lasses brave?
I'se Jockey take thee Jenny true,
to be my wadded Wife;
Forsake my Loons and Lubber-Loons,
to please thee all my life.
FINIS.
