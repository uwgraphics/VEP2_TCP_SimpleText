The willy, witty, neat, and pretty, Damsel: Which to a Soldier often made
this answer,
I dare not do no more nor the back of your hand Sir,

To the tune of, The Oil of Barley.




NOt long agone,
Walking a^one,
Abroad to take the air,
Under a shaid,
I spied a Maid,
Both beautiful and fair
^^re^t h^a^t quoth I,
In courticy,
To make me som^thing boulder,
Exchange a kiss,
And donot miss,
With me that am a Soldier,
Which she denied,
And thus replied,
Being ready with her answer,
Forbear to woe,
For I dare not do,
No more nor the back of your hand Sir.
What is the cause
My bony Less,
That thou should now deny me
I in my Love
Will constant prove,
If thou'st be pleased to try me
Then about the wast,
I her embrast,
And in plain terms I told her,
I would her beed,
And also weed,
If she would love a Soldier,
Which she denied etc.
I Will give thee Rings,
And costly things,
Fine brasle^s of rich amber,
If that my will,
Thou will fulfill,
And walk into my chamber,
There may we prove.
The tricks of Love,
And I shall be more bolder,
When as I see,
Thou will agree,
To Love a valiant Soldier,
Which she, etc.
I Will deck thee brave
And thou shall have,
Both danty fair and clothing,
My love to thee,
Shall be so free,
I Will let thee want for nothing,
In garments gay,
Each holy day,
Thou shall both pearl and Gold were
Like Loves fair Queen,
Thou shall be seen,
If thou will wed a Soldier,
Which she etc.
A Bever hat,
Be sure of that,
I Will for a faring give thee,
A Silken gown,
With Lace lade down,
Sweet heart thou may believe me
Warm Muffes, new Ruffes,
Bone lece and Cuffes,
Most gorgious to behold sure,
If thouls love me,
As ice love thee,
Belive me as Soldier,
Which she etc.
The second part,
To the same Tune.
A Soldiers wife
Lives a merry life.
And it is a tpye of honor,
In every place,
To have the grace
Of Mistr^s put upon her.
Which honor brave,
Thy self shall have,
Then prethy Love be bolder,
Be not so coy,
Let me enjoy,
Thy love and be a Soldier,
Which she denied,
And thus replied
Being ready with his answer,
Forbear to woe,
For I dare not do,
No more nor the back of your hand Sir.
If I quoth she,
Should weed with thee,
We both might fail in carrage,
My age is green,
I Am scarce fifteen,
It Is a little to young for marriage,
Without delay,
I mean to stay,
Tell I am something older,
I find as yet,
I am unfit,
To meddle with a Soldier,
Therefore away, etc,
There are young men,
Both now and then,
Whose wits are very nimble,
They Will cog they will lie,
They Will falcyfie,
They Will flatter and desemble,
Vntell they have.
What they do crave,
And after wards they care not,
Therefore be still,
I'ft be your will,
To trust you Sir I dare not,
Forbear quoth she,
I pray let be,
Take this word for an answer,
Although you woe
I will not do,
No more nor the back of your hand Sir.
I in some part:
Could find in heart,
To leave for thee my dear,
My maden head,
Which I have kept,
Almost this fifteen year,
But if with shame,
Yould stain my name,
It would be my undoing
Wherefore kind Sir,
I pray stand far,
And leave your desprat woe(...)
Pish fie be gone,
Let me alone,
Take this word for an answe^
Forbear to woe,
For I dare not do,
No more nor the back of your han^ (...).
I knew a Maid,
That wat betrayed,
Her name was pretty Nelly,
A young man staid,
And with her played,
Till be got up her belly,
Which being done.
Away he rune,
He being but a stranger,
Which makes me say,
As well I may,
Much trusting breeds much danger
Therefore etc.
When I had been,
So long and seen,
This Damsells disposion,
We both departed,
Merry hearted,
She having made condision,
For me to stay,
Vntell the day,
That I return from Gloucester,
To end all strife,
She Will be my wife,
She says what ere it cost her,
And thus the jest,
I have exprect, etc.
