BE VALIANT STILL, etc. A NEW SONG Much in request. Being the Advice of an
experienced Lady in Martial Affairs, to her Lover a young Soldier.
Tune of, An old Carle to daunten me.
BE valiant still, be valiant still,
Be stout and great, and valiant still,
And I Will embrace you in my Arms,
And please you with Loves pleasant Charms
And then my Heart shall be at rest,
In the Thoughts of him whom I love best.
Be valiant still, be valiant still,
Be stout and great, and valiant still.
And I will place you on a Stage,
To fight a Duel you must engage,
And from all Wounds you shall be clear,
You Will gain the Prize you need not fear.
Be valiant still, etc.
And if you will try that manly sport,
I Will make you Captain of a Fort,
And show you how to lay the Seige,
And fire when ever occasion needs.
Be valiant still, etc.
And if you will venture to scale the Wall,
I Will make you General of all;
Be stout and great, and always bold,
And without all doubt you will gain the Hold.
Be valiant still, etc.
And if a City will not yield,
Then place your Tents into the Field,
Throw in your Bomb-balls then at large,
But be sure your Piece be soundly charged:
Be valiant still, etc.
FINIS.
