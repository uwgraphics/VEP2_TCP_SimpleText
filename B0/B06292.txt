Truths Integrity, OR, A Curious Northern Ditty Called, Love will find out the
Way.
To a pleasant new tune




OVer the Moutains
and under the waves,
Over the Fountains,
and under the Graves.
Under floods which are the deepest,
which do Neptune obey,
Over Rocks which are the steepest,
Love will find out the way.
Where there is no place
for the Glowworm to lie,
Where there is no place
for the receipt of a fly,
where the gnat she dares not venture
lest her self fast she lay,
But if Love come he will enter,
and will, etc.
You may esteem him,
a child of his force,
Or you may deem him,
a coward which is worse.
But if he whom Love does honor,
be concealed from the day,
Set a thousand guards upon him,
Love will, etc.
Some think to loose him,
which is too unkind,
And some do suppose him,
po^ heart to be blind,
But if he were hidden,
do the best you may,
Blind Love if so you call him.
will find, etc.
Well may the Eagle
stoop down to the fist,
Or you may inveagle
the Phoenix of the East.
With fear the Tigers
to give over their prey,
But never stop a Lover,
he will, etc
From Dover to Barwick,
and Nations throughout,
Brave Guy Earl of Warwick,
that Champion so stout.
With his warlike behavior,
through the world he did stray
To win h^s Phillis favor,
Love will etc,
In order next enters
Bevis so brave,
After Adventures
and policy grave.
To see whom he desired,
his Josian so gay,
For whom his heart was fired,
Love will find out the way.
The second Part,
To the same tune,




THE Gordion knot,
which True Lovers knit,
Undo you cannot
nor yet break it.
Make use of your Inventions,
their fancyes to betray,
To frustrate your Intentions,
Love will find out the way;
From Court to the Cottage,
in Bower and Hall,
From the King to the Beggar.
Love conquers all.
Though nere so stout and Lordly
strive do what you may,
Yet sure, never so hardy;
Love will, etc.
Love has power over Princes,
and greatest Emperor,
In any Provinces,
such is Loves power.
There is no resisting
but him obey,
In spite of all contesting,
Love will, etc,
If that he were hidden,
as all men that are,
Were strictly forbidden,
that place to declare.
Winds that have no abidings,
pitying their delay,
Will come and bring him Tidings.
and direct etc.
If the Earth could part him,
he would gallop it over,
If the Seas should overthwart him,
he will swim to the shore.
Should his Love become a swalow
through his Air to stray,
Love will lend wings to follow,
and will find out the way.
There is no striving,
to cross his intent,
There is no contriving,
his plots to prevent,
But if once the Messenger greet him
that his True love does stay,
If death should come and meet him,
Love will find out the way.
