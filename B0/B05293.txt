ACT And INTIMATION anent this current Parliament 14 March, 1699.
THe Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council considering, that His Majesty by His
Proclamation, of the date the Twentieth of December last by past, has
Adjourned this current Parliament to this day, being the fourteenth day of
March one Thousand six Hundred ninety nine years; and that His Majesty has
not as yet signified His Pleasure, either by sending a Commissioner for Holding
thereof at this Day, nor his Royal Order for Adjourning the same to a further
Day; And seeing both by the nature of the High Court of Parliament, and by
express Acts of Parliament, Parliaments are current, without the necessity of a
special continuation, until they be Dissolved by his Majesty's particular
Warrant, whose sole Prorogative it is to Dissolve, as well as to Call, Hold,
and Prorogue the same: Therefore the said Lords of His Majesty's Privy
Council, in expectation of His Majesty's express Orders, and to prevent the
unnecessary trouble of the Members, and other good Subjects, who may be
concerned to repair to the Meeting of Parliament, have thought fit to ordain
Intimation to be made, that all Members of Parliament be ready to Meet, and
Attend in this present current Parliament, so soon as His Majesty's Will and
Pleasure shall be signified to them for that Effect: and that none may pretend
Ignorance, Ordains these Presents to be Printed, and Published at the
Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, by the Lion King at Arms and his Brethren, Heralds,
and Pursevants, and at the Mercat-crosses of the Head-Burghs of the several
Shires within this Kingdom, by Macers, or Messengers at Arms.
