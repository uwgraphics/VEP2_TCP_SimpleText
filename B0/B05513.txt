part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting:
Forasmuch as by the Seventh Act of the Fourth Session of Our current
Parliament, there was an Offer made to Us of Two Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy
Nine Foot, to be Levied off the several Burghs and Shires of the Kingdom,
effeirand to the proportions and number set down in the foresaid Act; likeas,
by the Thirty Third Act of the Fifth Session of the same Parliament, It is
Statute and Ordained, that there should be Furnished to Us the Number of One
Thousand Men yearly, when we should require them, and that in manner mentioned
in the said Act, of which two Levies for the said year One Thousand Six Hundred
and Ninety Three, as also the said year One Thousand Six Hundred and Ninety
Five, there are notwithstanding of the several Proclamations emitted by Us in
prosecution of the said Acts a considerable Number of deficient Men yet resting
Unfurnished; and it being requisite and necessary at this time, that the said
Deficients should be put forth and furnished by the Heretors, and others
liable, to put forth the same with all Expedition: Therefore, We with Advice of
the Lords of Our privy Council, have thought fit to Ordain, and do hereby
peremptorly Require and Ordain the Commissioners of Supply of the several
Shires, Stewartries and Burghs within this Kingdom, to meet at their respective
Head-Burghs; these on this side of Tay, upon the Eleventh Day of March next to

Twenty Third Day of the said Month of March; with Certification to such of them
as shall not meet, that they shall be liable each of them to the Penalties
contained in the Acts of Parliament made anent the Militia: And they being Met,
that they Consider and Inquire diligently, how the Orders formerly given by
them for the Outreick of the said Levies have been observed; And for that
Effect, they require the Heretors, Leaders of the foresaid first Levy One
thousand Six hundred Ninety three: As also the particular Commissioners or
Heretors Appointed for the Outreik of the said Levy One thousand Six hundred

Lotting, Appointed by the foresaid Act of Parliament One thousand Six hundred
Ninety five, with an Account of the Names and Designations of the Persons one
or more upon whom the Lots fell; and whether these persons were Delivered, or
given up as Deserters, or otherwise; that the said respective Heretors,
Leaders and particular Commissioners, who cannot give a sufficient Account for
their Discharge in the Premises, that they yet Exhibit and Produce the Men to
the said Commissioners, wherein they are Deficient, And that within the Number
of Sixdays, after the days of Meeting hereby Appointed, to the said
