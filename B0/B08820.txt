Earth (h) with Ministers Rev. 1. 20. Tit. 1. 5.
And administrations 1 Cor. 12. 5.
was a special thing Ephesians. 4. 14-16.
In which Most Excellent State Psalm. 87. and 84. 11.
they holding Repentance from dead works, and Faith toward God, the Doctrine
of Baptismes, and the Laying on of hands, the Resurrection from the dead, and
eternal Judgment, must go on to Perfection Heb. 6. 1, 2.
in the constant and continual Practice of the Great Mystery of Godliness,
according to the Direction of the blessed Word and Spirit 1 Timothy 3. 14-16. and
4. 1-13-16.
By which the Man of Sin 2 These. 2. 3-12.
in The Mystery of Iniquity is discovered to be a Church of Malignant men Ps.
26 5.
compacted together as One Man, to establish Iniquity by a Law and to set up
spiritual wickednesses, in high places, Living in ^^de, idleness, and
fullness of bread, and being without compassion of the poor, ful^ of Trianny,
and violent rage against the Righteous Rev. 12, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17.
and ^^ing their Righteous Souls with their Inclean Conversations Shedding the
blood of the precious Saints and Prophets Rev. 16. 6. and 17. ^.
Therefore these (...) ^re spiritually called Sodom and Egypt where our Lord
was Crucified Rev. 11. 8.
Bearing the names of The Beast Rev. 13. 1. 11, 14, 15.
Whore Rev. 17. 1.
of Babylon Rev. 17. 5, 18.
and False ^rophe^ Rev. 16. 13. and 19, 20.
whose end is utter destruction Rev. 18. and 19.
And therefore I am thoroughly convinced in Conscience of the falsenesse of the
malignant Church of England, And of the evil of all other States which are
contrary to Christ's Institutions, knowing that our great high Priest, who is
holy, harmeless, undefiled, and separated from sinners Heb. 7. 26.
would have his people avoid all manner and measure of spiritual Communion 2
Cor. 6. 14-17.
with such, he having called us Rev. 18. 4.
from the fellowship of Devils 1 Cor. 10. 20, 21.
and wicked men 2 Cor. 6. 17.
that we may not in a way of spiritual worship sit with mortal men of false
vanity, nor go in with dissemblers, but hate the Church of evil doers, and
not fit with the wicked. Psalm. 26. 4, 5.
Therefore according to Christ's Institutions and Commandments being with my
Seed Exo. 10. 9.
and substance V. 25, 26.
fully separated, not only from them, but also from those, who communicate
with them, either in their Public Congregations, or private societies; I do
resolve, through the grace of the ever-living-God, who has brought me out of
Babell, never to return to their vain inventions, their humane devises,
abominable Idolatries, nor superstitious high places which were built and
dedicated to Idolatry, but to abstain from all appearance of evil 1 These. 5.
22.
and to worship God only in spirit and truth Joh. 4. 24.
according to that manner, which he has prescribed in his word, without adding
or diminishing. Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Prove. 30. 6. Rev. 22. 18, 19.
And through the light of the holy Scriptures, I clearly see, not only the
necessity of this holy way of Separation, in obedience to the heavenly Call,
but also the great need of continuing in Christian Fellowship, Communion, and
Society of Saints, And that to be of the Visible Particular Church of Christ,
is most needful for the Sain^s edification in this life; For to that heavenly
company is committed the Oracles of God Romans 3. 2.
By them the Kingly, Priestly, Prophetical, and Apostolical Offices of Jesus
Christ is to be set forth; For the King and Lord of all administrations 1 Cor.
12. 5.
who is that great Prophet Acts 3. 22, 23.
And the Apost^e and high Priest of their profession Heb. 3. 1.
has set in the Church first Apostles, secondarily Prophets 1 Cor. 12. 28.
then Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers Ephesians. 4. 11.
For the g^thering together, and perfecting, of the Saints, and for the work
of the Ministry, and for the edification of the body of Christ Ephesians. 4. 11.
until the end of the world V. 13. Mat. 28. 19, 20.
Elders has he also appointed to be Rulers of his people 2 Timothy 5. 17. Romans
12. 8.
And Deacons Acts 6. 3-5. Phil. 1. 1. 1 Timothy 3. 8-13.
to provide for the Congregation of his poor, that they may ^^ called the City
of righteousness, the faithful City Isa. 1. 26.

and presence Mat. 18. ^0.
whereby it is known to be Syon Psalm. 76. 1, 2, 3.
with whom he has promised to be 132. 13.
and delights to sit 14.
even unto the end of the world Mat. 28. 20.
though they be never so few in number 18. 20.
And I am more and more possessed with the thought of the excellency thereof,
And of the sweet-closing-neer-communion which the Saints of God have with
Christ therein Cant. Ps. 45. Rev. 14. 1-5

commandments of the LORD their God 1 Chro. 28. 8.
