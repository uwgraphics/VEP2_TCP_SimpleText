A Godly Warning for all Maidens by the example of Gods Judgments showed upon
one Jermans wIfe of Clifton in the County of Nottingham, who lying in
Childbed, was born away and never heard of after.
The tune is, The Ladies fall.


YOu dainty ^ames so finely framed,
of beautyes chiefest mold,
And you that trip it up and down
like Lambs in Cupids Fold.
Here is a Lesson to be learned,
a Lesson in my mind,
For such as will prove false in love
and bear a faithless mind.
Not far from Nottingham of late
in Clifton as I hear,
There dwelt a fair and comely Dame
of beauty without peer:
Her cheeks were like the Crimson rose
yet as you may perceive,
The fairest face the falsest heart.
and soonest will deceive.
This gallant Dame she was beloved
of many in that place
And many sought in marriage be^
her body to embrace.
At last a proper handsome youth
young Bateman called by name,
In hope to make a married wife
unto this Maiden came.
Such love and liking there was found,
that he from all the rest,
Had stole away this Maidens heart
and she did love him best.
Then plighted promise secretly,
did pass between them two,
That nothing could but death it self
this true Loves knot undo.
He broke a piece of gold in twain,
one half to her he gave,
The other as a pledge quoth he
Dear heart my self will have.
If I do break my vow quoth she
while I remain alive,
May never thing I take in hand
be seen at all to thrive.
This passed on for two months space,
and then this Maid began
To settle love and liking too
upon another man.
One Jerman who a widdower was,
her husband needs must be
Because he was of greater wealth,
and better in degree.
Her vows and promise lately made
to Bateman she denied*
And in despite of him and his
she utterly defied.
Well then quoth he if it be so
that you will me forsake,
And like a false and forsworn wretch
another husband take.
Then thou shall not live one quiet hour
for surely I will have,
Thee either now alive or dead,
when I am laid in grave:
Thy faithless mind thou shall repent
therefore be well assured,
When for thy sake thou bear report,
what torments I endured.


But mark how Bateman died for love
he finished up his life,
The very day she married was
and made old Jermans wife,
For with a strangling Cord God wat
great moan was made therefore
He hanged h^mself in desperate sort
before the Brides own door.
Whereat such sorrow pierced her heart
and troubled sore her mind
That she could never after that
one day of comfort find.
For wheresoever she did go,
her Fancy did surmise,
Young Batemans pale and ghastly Ghost
appeard before her eyes,
When she in bed at night did lie
between her husbands arms,
In hope thereby to sleep and rest,
in safety without harms.
Great cries and grievous groans she heard
a voice that sometimes said,
O thou art she that I must have
and will not be denay'd.
But she then being big with Child
was for the Infants sake,
Preserved from the Spirits power
no vengeance could it take,
The Babe unborn did safely keep
as God appointed so,
His Mothers body from the Fiend
that sought her overthow.
But being of her burden eas d,
and safely brought to bed,
Her care and grief began anew
and further sorrow bred.
And of her friends she did entreat
desiring them to stay,
Out of bed quoth she this night
I shall be bern away.
Here comes the spirit of my Love
with pale and ghastly face,
Who till he bears me hence away
will not depart this place.
Alive or dead I am his right
and he will surely have,
In spite of me and all the world
what I by promise gave.
O watch with me this night I pray
and see you do not sleep.
No longer then you be awake
my body can you keep.
All promised to do their best.
yet nothing could suffice
In middle of the night to keop
sad slumber from their eyes.
So being all full fast asleep
to them unknown which way.
The child-bed-woman that woeful night
from thence was born away,
But to what place no creature knew
nor to this day can tell,
As strange a thing as ever yet
in any age befell.
You Maidens that desire to love
and would good husbands choose
To him that you have vowed to love
by no means do refuse.
For God that hears all secret Oaths
will dreadful vengeance take.
On such that of a wilful vow
do slender reckoning make.
