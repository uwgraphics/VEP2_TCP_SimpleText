Q. Who are your Natural Parents?

A. My Father and Mother.

Q. Who are your Spiritual Parents?

A. God and his Church.

Q. Which of these two names are demanded of you?

A. My Christian name.

Q. Why so?

A. That by this name, I may be put in remembrance of my Baptism, wherein it
was given me.

Q. Why was your name given you in Baptism?

A. That thereby I might be distinguished from other men, and that I might be
put in mind, as often as I hear my name, of the Covenant then ratified between
God and me.

Q. Who gave you this name?

A. My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a member of
Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Q. What benefit did you then receive by Baptism.

A. Three; First, I was made a member of Christ: Secondly, the child of God:
Thirdly, an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Q. What has a Member relation unto?

A. To a Body.

Q. How many bodies has Christ?

A. Two, a Natural as we have, and a Mystical.

Q. of which are you a member?

A. Of his Mystical Body.

Q. What Body is that?

A. His Church. Col. 1.18.

Q. What is Christ to his Church?

A. He only is the Head thereof.

Q. What does Christ the Head, for his Body the Church.

A. He gives it Spiritual Life, motion and direction, as a head does to the
body.

Q. What must you feel in you, to be sure that you are a true member of Christ?

A. That I live by him to God, am moved by his Spirit, and directed by his
Word.

2. Q. How are you made the child of God?

A. By the Grace of Adoption.

Q. How know thou, that thou art the child of God by Grace?

A. Because he has given the earnest of the Spirit into our hearts, crying
Abba; Father, which Spirit witnesses to our spirits, that we are the children
of God. Romans 8.15,16.

Q. Is Baptism of that virtue, that by the only outward washing thereof, every
one is made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the
Kingdom of Heaven.

A. No, for unless a man be born again of water, and also of the Holy Ghost, he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. John 3.5.

Q. Why then say thou, that by Baptism thou art made a member of Christ?

A. Because Baptism is the laver of Regeneration by the power of the Spirit. *
And therefore we may rightly say, that we are thereby made the Members of
Christ, and the children of God; and believe the same touching all others that
are baptized.

Q. Why is it added, That we are Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven?

A. Because being sons by Adoption, we are heirs, and heirs of God, and heirs
annexed with Christ. Romans 8.17. 1 Pet. 1.3,4.

A. They did promise and vow three things in my name: First, That I should
renounce the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of the wicked
world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh: Secondly, That I should believe
all the Articles of the Christian Faith: And Thirdly, That I should keep Gods
holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.

1. Q. How are you to renounce the Devil?

A. By refusing to hearken to any of his wicked suggestions.

Q. How are you to renounce the world?

contentments which the world affords, as they are a means to draw me from
God. 1 John. 2.15.

Q. How are you to renounce the lusts of the flesh?

A. By denying satisfaction to my own natural desires and affections, so far as
they are any way repugnant to the Word of God. Romans 13.14.

Q. Do thou think that thou art bound to do as they have promised for thee?

A. Yes verily, and by Gods help so I will; and I heartily thank our Heavenly
Father, that he has called me to this state of Salvation, through Jesus Christ
our Savior; And I pray God to give me his Grace that I may continue in the
same unto my lives end.

Q. Art thou able to perform all these things?

A. Not of my self, but in some measure I am enabled thereunto by Gods Grace.
Phil. 4.13.

Q. What do thou chiefly learn out of the Articles of your belief?

A. First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who has made me and all the
world.

inspiration?

reconciled you unto God?

A. Jesus Christ the Son of God.

Q. By what means did Christ redeem you?

A. By suffering death upon the Cross for my sins, and the sins of the whole

Q. What is the word of God, which does prescribe the manner of Gods worship?

A. The word of God is contained in those Books which are called the Canonical
Scriptures.

to the which, men must frame their faith and manners. Isa. 8.20. Psalm. 119.9.

Inspiration, and so is indeed the Word of God?

sins, and eternal righteousness. Romans 4.18. Heb. 11.1.

Q. When made he man?

A. Last of all, because he was made Lord of all, and might find all things
ready for him Genesis 1.26.

A Because he saves his people from their sins, neither is there salvation in
any other. Mat. 1.21. Acts 4.1.

of Gods by Grace, and by Adoption. John 1.14. Romans 8.15. Gal. 4.5.

Q. What do you learn from hence that Jesus Christ is the Son of God by nature?

was performed and suffered by him, is infinitely meritorious for our salvation.

of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin. L^ke 1,35.

God and man in one Christ, Luke 1.35. Romans 9.5. 1 Timothy 2.5.

Q. Why must our Savior be both God and Man?

A. He must be a man, because man had sinned, and therefore a man must die for
sin to appease Gods wrath; he must be God to sustain and uphold the Manhood, to
overcome and vanquish death. 1 Timothy 2.5,6.

Q. What learn you out of these words, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
born of the Virgin Mary?

A. I learn: 1. By his birth that he was man, that so he might suffer for my
sin.

2. By the manner of his conception by the Holy Ghosh, that he was without all
manner of sin, and so the Sacrifice of himself being most pure, it was precious
for our redemption.

IV. Art. Q. What was Pontius Pilat^ that condemned Christ?

A. He was at that time the Governo^ of Judea, under the Roman Emperor. Luk^
3.1.

Q. What death did Christ suffer?

Q. Why suffered Christ the death of the Cross, rather then any other kind of
death?

2. It was most painful,

3. Thereby he took upon him the curse, to free me from the curse of the Law.
Gal. 3.13.

Q. Seeing Christ has thus died for us, why yet must Gods Saints die?

A. Not as a satisfaction or penalty for sin, but for two special benefits:
First, for that sin is thereby abolished in my nature, Romans 6.7. Secondly,
death is made an entrance for our souls into Life eternal. Phil. 1.23.

Q. Could the sufferings of Christ, which were but a short time, countervail
everlasting damnation, and so appease Gods wrath?

A. Because Christ, who was God suffered; though not in his Godhead; and that
is more, then if all the men in the world had suffered for ever. Acts 20.28.

Q. What followed upon his death?

A. His burial and descending into hell, that is, his subjection to the power
and dominion of death, and the grave for a time. Heb. 2.14. Acts 2.24.

Q. Why did he abide thus under the power of death and the grave?

A. That it might be certainly known that he was dead, and that the body of sin
might be utterly destroyed and abolished in us for ever. Romans 6.6.

V. Art. Q Was it needful that Christ being dead, should rise again?

A, Yes it was for his own glory and our good.

Q. How for his glory?

A. That being formerly abased as a servant, and crucified as a sinner, he
might thus be declared to be the Son of God, and exalted to be a Prince and a
Savior. Romans 1.4. Acts 5.30,31.

Q. How for our good?

A. That having paid the price of our redemption by his death, we might have
good assurance of our Justification by his Life. Romans 4.25.

Q. Why did Christ rise again the third day?

A. Because it was prophesied of him, that he should see no corruption. Acts
2.27.

Q. Why did he not rise before the third day?

A. Lest rising so presently upon his death, his enemies might take occasion to
cavil that he was not dead. Mat. 27.63.

Q. Why would he not put it off until the fourth day?

A. Lest the Faith of his Disciples should have been weakened, and their hearts
too much cast down and discouraged. Luke 24.21.

the dead?

A. 1. That he is risen and has overcome death and Hell for my Justification.
1 Cor. 15.17.7.

for our ascension thither. Ephesians. 4.8. John 14.2.3.

come to judge the quick and the dead?

A. 1. I learn to my comfort, that he that is my Savior, shall be my Judge.
Job 19. verse 25.

2. To the terror of the wicked and ungodly, that he shall be their Judge, whom
they have refused and despised. 2 These. 1.8.

Q. Who are the quick and the dead that are to be judged by Christ?

A. All men that ever were from the beginning, are, or shall be to the end of
the world, whether they shall be alive then, or dead before.

Q. Why does Christ defer his coming?

A. He waits till the number of the elect be accomplished, till the measure
of iniquity be fulfilled, till his enemies be all subdued and abolished. Rev.
6.11. Mat. 13.30. Heb. 10.13.

Q. What need is there that the dead should be brought to Judgment, seeing
particular judgment was given of them before, whether they be good or evil?

A. It is needful for two causes. 1. Because the first judgment pertains only
to the soul, but the latter to the whole man, both body and soul. 2 Cor. 5.10.

2. That that particular Judgment may be made manifest before all men, and
that there may be a more manifest declaration of Gods just judgment. Romans 2.5.

VIII. Art. Q. What is the Holy Ghost*

A. The third person in the Trinity, equal in majesty and glory to the Father
and the Son, and joyn^ly proceeding from them both. Acts 5.3,4. John 15.26.

Q. Ghost is an old English word, and signifies Spirit, why is the third person
called Spirit?

A. 1. Because God is a Spirit (that is) an immaterial and pure essence. John
4.24. 2. Because the Holy Ghost is the Spirit and breath of God, blowing freely
where it lists, and working spiritually for manner, means and matter where it
pleases. John 3.8. Acts 2.2,3,4.

Q. Why is the third person called holy?

A. Not only because of his essential holiness as God, but because he is the
author and worker of holiness in men. 1 Cor. 6.11.

IX. Art. Q. Why do you say, I believe the Church, not in the Church?

A. We do believe that there is a Church, but we do not believe in the Church,
but in God; the Church here below at the best, is but a company of men called,
justified, sanctified in part, and therefore may err.

Q. What is it then to believe the Church?

A. 1. That there is and always shall be a Church. 2. That I am one of the
Church. 3. To believe the doctrine of the Church, wherein it follows Christ,
the Prophets and Apostles, the only sure pillars and ground of truth.

A. No, there is but one true Church of Christ, though there may be many
particular visible Churches, which are parts thereof; yet there is but one
Catholic and Universal Church, of which not one shall be lost, and out of
which not one shall be saved. Ephesians. 5.23. John 17.12.

Q. Why is it called Catholic or Universal?

A. It is called Catholic or Universal, 1. In respect of time, because it has
been and shall be in all ages. Acts 2.39. 2. In respect of persons, it consists
of all sorts of men, high and low, rich and poor. Acts 2.10,34. 3. In respect
of place, it has been gathered from all parts of the earth. Rev. 5.9. Rev. 7.9.

Q. Why is the Church called Holy?

the Spirit. Romans 3.24. Cant. 4.7.

Q. What is the Communion of Saints?

A. That holy and sweet fellowship, which all the members of Christ's Church
have one with another; as they make all but one body in Christ, so
communicating of all good things unto one another, whether spiritual or
temporal, as their mutual necessities do require. 1 John 1.3. 2 Cor. 8.14.

Q. Why are all believers called Saints?

A. Because they are partakers of Christ's holiness, daily growing and
increasing in the same; And to let us know, that none shall be Saints in
Heaven, but such as are first Saints on Earth. Heb. 12.10. 3 Cor. 7.1.

Q. What duty does this communion of Saints require of us?

A. To renounce all fellowship with sin, and sinners, to edify one another in
Faith and Love, to delight in the society of the Saints, and to keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

X. Art. Q. What is meant by the forgiveness of sins?

A. Forgiveness of sins is that great blessing of God, which Jesus Christ by
his death and passion, procured for all that believe in him; whereby God
esteems of their sins as no sins, or as never committed by them.

Q. What duties are required of us, that find our sins pardoned?

A. To sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto us; to forgive others, as God
has forgiven us; to renew our assurance by prayer, repentance and new
obedience?

XI. Art. Q. What professest thou to believe in the eleventh Article, The
resurrection of the body?

A. That the bodies of the wicked shall be raised by the power of Christ, as he
is Judge, and joined to their souls, so to continue together without separation
for evermore in the torments of Hell; but the bodies of the faithful, and so
mine among others, shall be raised by virtue of Christ's resurrection, to enjoy
in body and soul together life everlasting. 1 Cor. 15.20. 1 These. 4.14,16. John
5.28,29.

XII. Art. Q. What is life everlasting?

his Angels. 1 These. 4.17.

Ghost, entered upon here, and inherited hereafter. Mat. 25.34. Ephesians. 1.13,14.

2. By faith I shall overcome the enemies of my Salvation. 1 John 5.4.

3. Being justified and overcomming, I shall inherit eternal life. Romans 8.38.
Tit. 3.7.

Q. What is justification?

righteousness of his own, but upon the free remission of his sins and the
imputation of Christ's righteousness and obedience. Phil. 3.9. Romans 3.24.

A. 1. Inwardly by the Spirit, the fountain of all Spiritual Graces. Acts

Faith. Romans 10.17.

The Third Part of the CATECHISM, concerning the COMMANDMENTS.
Qu. HOw many Commandments are there?

A. Ten.

no nor life it self in respect of his glory. Mat. 6.33.

2. If I render my duty truly to God, I must do my duty also to my Neighbor,
for if I neglect it to my neighbor, whom I see daily, it is evident that I do
so to God. 1 John. 3.17.

it: If the glory be his, then for his great names sake he will never forsake
us; but will always do us good, unto the end, and in the end, especially seeing
his Kingdom, power and glory are established, and do continue for all eternity,
Even so be it, yea, and so it shall be.

A. Yea, he does. 1. Because he loves to hear the voice of his own spirit in
us, Romans 8.26,17. 2. Because the suit may be good, and yet the season not so
meet for us. Acts 1.7, Luke 18.1. 3 He takes pleasure in our constancy, being a
fruit of faith and fervency. Mat. 15.27,28. 4. Because such blessings as are

The Fifth Part of the CATECHISM touching the SACRAMENTS.
Qu. HOw many Sacraments has Christ ordained in his Church*

A. Two only as generally necessary to salvation, that is to say, Baptism and
the Supper of the Lord.

Q. What difference is there between Baptism and the Supper of the Lord?

A. Besides the difference in the signs and Sacramental rites; there is this
difference between them: Baptism is a Sacrament of our new birth, of entrance
into covenant with God, of Incorporation and engrafting into Christ, and of
Admission into the Church of God; and therefore we are once only baptized. Tit.
3.5. Genesis 17.11. Romans 6.3. But the Supper of the Lord is a Sacrament of
confirmation of faith, of renewing Gods covenant with us, and of ours with God,
and of further nourishing of our Souls to eternal life, and therefore we are
often partakers of it. 1 Cor. 10.2,3,4. 1 Cor. 11,24,25,26.

Q. What necess^ (...) there of being partakers of the Sacrament of Baptism?

A. Not an absolute, but a respective necessity: For the Infants of believing
parents dying unbaptized are not deprived of Salvation through Gods promise and
mercy; yet it is required.

1. As a requisite means and instrument, the contempt whereof is fearful and
damnable in such as refuse or neglect it, where according to Gods ordinance it
may lawfully be had

2. In regard of our weakness, who have need of all helps to strengthen our
faith.

Q. Are Infants to be baptized?

A. Yes; 1 Because Children in the Law were circumcised. Genesis 17.12.

2. They have interest to the thing signified, the Kingdom of Heaven, much more
to the sign. Mark 10.14.

3. All nations are bidden to be baptized, whereof Infants are a part. Mat.
28.19.

Q. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?

A. I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual Grace, given
unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same,
and a pledge to assure us thereof.

Q. Why is Christ the only Author of these Sacraments?

A. 1. Because he is God, and the Author of salvation, and therefore he only
may appoint the means as the Word and Sacraments.

2. Because Christ only can make the Sacraments effectual by his Spirit.

3. Because his heavenly wisdom knew best, how and whereof to institute the
Sacramental signs or elements.

5. Because Christ is the only Lord, to whose Laws alone the Church is, and may
be tied.

Q. How many parts be there in a Sacrament?

A. Two, the outward visible sign, and the inward spiritual grace.

Q. What is the outward visible sign in Baptism?

A. Water, wherein the person baptized is dipped or sprinkled with it. In the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Q. What is the inward and spiritual grace?

A. A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, for being by nature
born in sin, and the children of wrath, we are thereby made the children of
grace.

Q. Why has Christ ordained Baptism?

A. That being out of Christ by nature, we might by the Sacrament of our new
birth be engrafted into his Mystical body again. Tit. 3.5, John 3.5.

Q. What instruction does the Sacrament of Baptism teach us?

A. As by water the filthiness of the flesh is washed and done away, so by the
virtue of Christ's blood, the filthiness of the soul should be washed away. *
For the blood of Christ that is the force of his death, and the Spirit of
Christ, serve to cleanse the soul of a right receiver of Baptism, from the
filthiness of sin. 1 John 1.7. Ezekiel. 36.25.

Q. What is required of persons to be Baptized?

A. Repentance, whereby they forsake sin: and faith, whereby they steadfastly
believe the promises of God, made to them in that Sacrament.

Q. Why then are Infants baptized, when by reason of their tender age they
cannot perform them?

A. Yes, they do perform them by their sureties, who promise and vow them both
in their names, which when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform.

Q. What other reason can you show, why Infants are baptized, seeing they do
not yet actually believe?

A. Because the covenant and promises of God do belong unto them. Genesis 17.7.
Acts 2.38. Mat. 19.14. Romans 11.16.

Q. Seeing we are baptized only in Infancy, how has Baptism ^ffect to wash
away sins afterward comm^ted?

A. Baptism has this effect during our whole life, and is a perpetual fountain
ever washing us, while we with a lively faith do look unto the shedding of
Christ's blood. Zach. 13.1. Heb. 10.10,14.

Q. Why was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ordained?

A. For the continual remembrance of the Sacrifice of the death of Christ, and
the benefits we receive thereby.

Q. Why is it called the Lords Supper?

A. Because Christ ordained it at his last Supper.

Q. What is the outward part or sign of the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine, which the Lord has commanded to be received.

Q. Why be there two representing signs in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?

A. 1. That we might know that in Christ we have whole and perfect spiritual
nourishment, and whatsoever is requisite to Salvation.

2. For a more lively representation of his death and passion, wherein his body
and blood were separated.

Q. What is the duty of the Minister in the administration of the Sacrament?

A. To consecrate it, by declaring the institution thereof; and prayer joined
with thanksgiving, as also to break the Bread, and afterward to deliver the
Bread and Wine to the people.

Q. What is hereby signified?

A. The action of God the Father, offering Christ to all, and bestowing him
effectually upon the worthy receiver. 1 Cor. 10.16.

Q. What is the duty of the receiver?

A. To receive the Bread and Wine delivered, and to eat and drink thereof. Mat.
26.26,27. 1 Cor. 11.23,24.

Q. What is signified hereby?

A. Our receiving and feeding upon Christ by faith.

Q. What is the inward part or thing signified.

A. The Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily and indeed taken and
received of the faithful in the Lords Supper.

Q. By what means do we eat Christ's Body, and drink his Blood in the Sacrament?

A. Spiritually by faith, while in those outward signs, we do behold Christ
crucified for us. John 6.35,47. ^ Christ is truly and spiritually present in
the Sacrament, exhibited to the faith of every worthy receiver, but not
corporally united to the bread and wine in respect of place. Acts 3.21.
compared with Mat. 28.6. John 16.18.

Q. Is the bread and wine turned into the Body and Blood of Christ?

A. No, for so, 1. the unbelievers should eat Christ's Body, and drink his Blood.

2. We should destroy the nature of the Sacrament, by taking away the outward
sign.

3. We should destroy the truth of his natural body, by depriving it of the
true properties thereof. Heb. 2.17.

Q. What difference is there between our common bread and wine, which we
receive for our bodily sustenance, and the bread and wine in the Sacrament?

A. There is no difference in their nature and substance, but only in the use
and end; * for that, elements before common, are now consecrated to the signs
of things spiritual and holy; And therefore they are called holy Mysteries,
because they lively set forth and seal unto us, the Mystery of our redemption
purchased by Jesus Christ.

Q. What are the benefits, whereof we are partakers thereby?

A. The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the body and blood of
Christ, as our bodies are by the bread and wine.

Q. In respect of this benefit? What is the Lord Supper?

A. It is a Sacrament, whereby our continuance, nourishment and growth in
Christ is sealed unto us.

Q. What special benefits shall we have by receiving the holy Communion?

A. 1. We have hereby communion and fellowship with Christ (and through him
with the Father) set forth by our taking, eating, and inward digesting the
bread and wine, that become nourishment unto us, and are united to the
substance of our bodies.

2. Communion with one another and with all the faithful in all ages, set forth
by the same bread, being made of many grains of Corn, and by the same wine made
of many grapes.

3. Strength of faith for the death of Christ received and applied by faith in
the Sacrament, does strengthen our faith, and comfort our consciences in the
pardon of our sins.

4. All other graces and blessings are thereby conveyed unto us; And all the
marits of Christ's passion. and whatsoever is in him, is verily become ours.
Romans 8.38.

Q. What is required of them that come to the Lords Supper?

A. To examine themselves whether they repent them truly of their, former sins,
steadfastly purposing to lead a new life* have a lively faith in Gods mercy
through Christ, with a thankful remembrance of his death, and be in charity
with all men.

Q. That a man may know how to examine himself, what is he to know touching the
Lords Supper?

A. He must be able to discern the Lords Body.

Q. How is the Lords body discerned?

A. Two ways: 1. In our understanding, when we know what this Sacrament is, the
Author, the end and use thereof.

2. In our practice.

Q In how many things ought every one principally to examine himself?

A. In three things. 1 Faith. 2 Repentance. 3. Charity.

Quest. What faith is here required of you?

A. A special and peculiar faith, that applies to my soul and conscience, the
body and blood of Jesus Christ, crucified and shed for me, as truly as my mouth
receives the bread that is broken, and the wine that is poured out.

Quest. Why is faith required?

A. Because well we may eat the bread, and drink the wine without faith, but we
cannot eat Christ's body, and drink his blood without faith.

Q. What if a man find himself weak in faith, and full of doubting.

A. He must bewail his unbelief, pray for faith, seek to have his doubts
resolved, and so receive to be further strengthened in believing, because the
Sacraments are given us of God for the confirmation and strengthening of our
faith. Mark 9.24. Judge. 6.37.

A. Chiefly three things. 1. Confession that we acknowledge our selves sinners.

2. Contrition, that we be heartily and sincerely sorry for our sins.

3. Purpose of amendment, that we fully resolve and purpose with our selves,
never to commit them, nor the like again, but to lead the rest of our lives
according to Gods holy Will and Commandments.

Q Why is repentance so necessary?

A. Because this Sacrament is the seal of the remission of sins in Christ's
blood, which cannot be had without repentance.

Q. How many offices be there of love?

A. Three. 1 To do our neighbor no wrong. 2 To do him good if we can. 3 If he
does us wrong, to forgive him.

Q. Why is charity so necessary?

A. Because this Sacrament is a seal, as of our union with Christ, so of our
Communion and fellowship with our brethren the members of Christ.

Q. Why ought every one to examine himself?

A. 1. Because the unworthy receiver is guilty of the body and blood of Christ.
1 Cor. 11.27.

2. He provokes the Lord to wrath, and so eats and drinks his own
damnation. 1 Cor. 11.29.

Q. How ought a man's heart to be affected in receiving the Sacrament?

A With reverence, Joy and comfort, meditating on the outward, signs, and what
they signify: of the wonderful love of God, and of Christ herein, of our
Communion with Christ, his graces and faithful people. Lastly, we ought to stir
up our hearts to be exceeding thankful for so precious benefits. Exodus 3.5.
Genesis 28.17. 1 Kings 8.66.

Q. How ought every Christian to behave himself after the receiving of the
Sacrament?

A. He must endeavor to find an increase of faith in Christ, and of his love
to all Gods children, a greater measure of dying to sin, and a greater care to
live in newness of life, abounding more and more in well doing. Prove. 4.18.
Ezekiel. 47.12.
