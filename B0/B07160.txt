TO THE RIGHT GODLY, WORSHIPFVLL, AND VIGILANT PASTOR IN Christ's Kirk, Iohne
Erskin of Dun, especial planter and builder of the Reformed within the bounds
of Angus, Merns, Stermonth, and Gowrie: James Anderson, Minister at Collace,
his most humble, and obedient in Christ, wishes grace and peace from God the
Father, with increase of spiritual gifts, and health of body, through Jesus
Christ our Savior. Amen.
RIght ancient Professor of the Truth,
Long time before it came to common sight:
Which perilous time thou passedst not with sleuth.
But hardily did hazard day and night,
To bring the Truth to liberty and light.
Life, Land, and gear, thou set them all apart,
Of that true Treasure so joyful was thine heart.
Thine house was harbor to all that professed,
Thy gear was common to them in time of need:
Above all other thou loved thy brethren best:
As thy own flesh thou did them cloth and feed:
Not naked love in word, but love indeed:
Which love the Lord forget not to restore;
The more thou gave, he gave thee aye the more.
And when it pleased Christ Jesus King of grace,
To bring his Truth to light and liberty,
And by the same, proud Papists to deface,
And them overthrow, with their Idolatry:
Then did he call thee to this dignity,
To plant his Kirk in Gowrie, Mernes, and Angus,
Which prudently thou have planted among us:
And have the same often watered with his word,
Persuading ever to perseverance:
And not to faint for fear of Fire or Sword:
But be enarmed with Faith and patience,
Builded on Christ, that Rock of sure defense,
Thus thou ceast not, but traueilledst faithfully,
Till infirm age perforce constrained thee.
Yea, though thou be now warded, as it were,
From tedious travels, which thou wast wo^t to tak,
And may not from thy Chamber journey far:
Yet in thy cure thou art not slow nor flacke:
But as the Be that does collect and make,
Her wholesome honey of many Herbs and Flowers,
So thou thy Sermons of sundry sweet Scriptures:
Which thou do form into most comely writ,
For special profit to thy Posterity:
Thy louable labors therein ere and late,
When thou art dead, shall live eternally,
And keep thy Name in blessed memory:
That as in youth thy tongue taught Christ's word,
So in thine age thy pen did preach that Lord.
I Can not dite as thou have done deserve,
In Kirk and Court, Country and Commonweal:
Careful the Kirk in peace for to preserve:
In Court thy counsel was stout, and true as steel:
Thy policy decores the Country well,
In planting Trees, and building places fair,
With costly Brigs over waters plain repair.
(...) THE WINTER NIGHT.
THe Winter night, I think it long,
Full long and teugh, while it ouergang,
The winters night I think so long.
Both long and dreigh till day.
Full long think I the winters night,
While day break up with beams so bright,
And banish darkness out of sight,
And works of darkness, Aa.
2
The Winter night that I of mean,
Is not this natural night I weine,
That lackes the light of the Sun shine,
And differs from the day.
But darkness of our mind it is,
Which hides from us the Heavens bliss,
Since Adam first did make the miss,
In Paradise that day.
3
The joyefull day is Jesus Christ,
The Woman's seed by God promised,
To tread the Serpents head, that Beast,
that did us first betray:
And it did tread him on the hiele,
The bitter death when he did feel,
In his Manhood, to reconcile
Us to our God for ay.
4
The filthy lover, that us illudes,
Is Satan, with his blinded buds,
Of fleshly lusts, and worldly goods,
which cause us go astray.
Who cease never, but subtillie,
First gars us do, syne gars us die
That longsome Night eternally,
To draw us from our Day.
5
We have no Day but only one,
The Son of God, our Life alone:
For other days we do know none,
Nor yet none other way.
To guide us to the Heavens glore,
And to that state us to restore,
Which Adam lost for evermore,
Were not that precious Day.
6
Which blessed Day must twice appear,
The first, to take our nature here
Of his blessed Mother, a Virgin clear,
As I say, does he say.
The second time, the world to judge,
Both quick and dead, that number hudge:
Where faithless shall find no refuge,
But godly, grace that Day.
7
The first cumming is long fore-gane,
Sensyne fourscore of years and ninetane,
Beyond six hundredth and a thousand,
Not an hour less or maa.
Then since the first cumming is past,
We should be looking for the last,
When the Archangel shall the blow blast,
To dite us to that Day.
8
Long was the Fathers winter night,
Five thousand years, by reckning right,
Twixt Adams fall, and Christ did light,
into our flesh that Day.
Yet though it was so long between,
They saw him with their spiritual eene,
Which was the strength did them susteene,
To bide that joyful day.
9
Abrams faith was so reposed
He saw that day, and was rejoysed,
Though faithles Jews their eyes closed,
When as come was that Day.
For which their proud hypocrisy,
And wilful incredulity,
They are and (their posterity)
In darkness to this day.
10
The prudent Prophet Isaie,
Did speak of him als specially,
As he had seen him sensibly,
And been at his birth day.
First saw him borne of a pure Maid,
Syne heard him preach the Gospel glad:
And last, our sins upon him laid,
To take them all away.
11
The Prophet David did perceive
This mystery beyond the laue,
His soul should not be left in grave,
Nor flesh corrupt away.
Of which as now I speak no mare,
Till proper place, but will it spare,
And forward to our purpose fare,
Lest we ouerlong delay.
12
When Daniel did expone the Dream,
Of the hudge Image, with copper wame,
With lims of iron, and feet of leame,
and hair of gold so gay.
He saw a stone without man's hand,
Break first the feet, when it did stand:
Syne brake it als small as the sand,
And brought it to decay.
13
Which Image, with their properties,
Did mean the four great Monarchies,
Of Babel, Perse, and Griece but lies,
And Romans in their ray.
The little stone that he did see,
That brake the Image so mightily,
Was Christ, that matchless Monarchy,
Which never shall decay,
14
When come was the appointed time,
That he should suffer for our crime,
He lighted in the Virgin wyme,
And did no longer stay.
That blessed Virgin then him bred,
Without company of man's bed:
The holy Ghost her ouershed,
As Gabriel did say.
15
Elizabeth not long before,
Conceived John, who gave him glore,
And in the womb did him adore,
For joye did spring and play.
His Mother then full fervently,
Calde Marie blessed eternally,
That she believed assuredly,
To bear that birth that day.
16
In Bethlehem when he was borne,
The Angels timely in the morn,
Came to the Herds without sojourne,
In Fields whereas they lay.
Saying, Rejoice and make great mirth,
We bring you tidinges mikell worth.
To you is borne a blessed birth,
In Bethlehem this day.
17
His Star als in the Firmament,
The wise men from the Orient,
Did call them forth incontinent,
And guide them on the way.
Till they came to the selfsame place,
Where Christ our King then newborn was:
That Stare would then no farther pass,
But stood still in a stay.
18
Then came they in right courteously,
Acknowledging his Majesty:
Offering to him these gifts three,
Gold, Incense, Mirh, that day.
The Gold because he was a King,
Incense, because God everlasting:
The Mirh, in token of burying,
Thus learned Doctors say.
19
Just Simeon into his Song,
Who for that day did look so long,
Said, Lord, let now thy servant gang
In peace, and pass away.
Since that mine eyes have seen this sight,
Of thy sweet Son the Gentles light,
And of the Jews the glory bright,
Whom thou have sent this day.
20
John Baptist did his way prepare,
And pointed with his finger there,
Behold the Lamb of God so fair,
That takes our sins away.
Bade them believe and him embrace,
Repent and mend, while they had space,
Or otherwise they get not no grace,
But die in sin that day.
21
When John in Iordane him baptized,
The Fathers voice him authorized,
This is my Son, in whom I am pleased,
Hear him what he does say.
And farther, in the peoples sight.
The holy Ghost did on him light,
And with him bode, to show his might,
As God and Man that Day.
22
The divine doctrine that he taught,
The wondrous works that he wrought,
In suckring all that to him fought,
And saying no man nay.
His bright transfiguration,
His patience in his Passion,
And glorious Resurrection,
Did prove he was our Day.
23
For never man did speak as he,
Causde deaf men hear, and blind-borne see:
He praide for them that causde him die,
And rose on the third day:
Then forty days remained here,
With his Disciples, and did them lere,
And gart them know the Scriptures clear,
Before he past away.
24
When he had fully pacified,
His Fathers wrath, and him obeyed
Unto the death, and purified,
Our sin, as white as Snow:
Then sent he his Apostles out,
In all the world to teach about,
And put all people out of doubt,
That come was his first Day.
25
Then with our flesh before them plain,
He did go up to Heaven again:
Whereas his manhood must remain,
Till the dreadful Doomesday.
But when that dreadful Day shall be,
No creature knows certainly,
Except the Father, and that only,
So doubtsome is that Day.
26
Wherefore the Lord bade all men watch,
and let not sin nor sleuth them catch,
Incase unawares he with them match,
When they least think that Day.
Is with the Virgins, which playde the fool,
That had their Lamps, but lacked Oil:
They got not in, but causde recoole,
And barred out that day.
27
The many tokens that we read,
That second day which should proceed,
Are come already in very deed,
Both come and gone away,
As well into the Heaven above,
As in the Earth almost are done,
Which significes it shall come soon,
As pleased God that day.
28
As for the signs celestial,
For longsomnesse I leave them all,
And treat of the terrestrial,
That should proceed that day.
In Scripture which are specified,
We shall them find accomplished,
To see the same then verrified,
Attend what I now say.
29
First shall be Battles, and bloody Wars,
That people and policy down bears,
We hear their rumor with our ears,
Increasing every day.
Both Foreign Wars and Intestiene,
That Realms and Countries wracketh clean:
We see this token before our eine,
Accomplished this day.
30
And yet the world most certainly,
Is settled in such security,
They think not once that they must die,
And answer to that day.
(...) 38
Love toward God is almost gone,
And love to Neighbor cold as stone,
No love now, but self-love alone,
Amongst all bears the sway.
In Gods own cause no feruencie:
The poor oppressed are cruelly:
All seek themselves so narrowly,
Promise and Love is quite away.
39
The fourth shall be defection,
From Christ, and his correction,
By folk of vile affection,
Before that second day:
That of his word they shall take loath,
And with true Preachers be so wroth,
That when Christ comes scarsely shall Faith,
Be found in Earth that day.
40
This token for to testify,
That it is now come certainly,
The manifest Apostasy,
That many make this day,
From Christ's Kirk, and little Flock,
Which hear his word, and bear his yoke*
Whom these Apostates do but mock,
By word and writ each day.
41
There is two sorts of Apostates,
Some from Christ's word are run-a-gates,
Themselves that excommunicates,
From Christ's Kirk and Fay.
Of this sort are our Jesuits,
The sliest sort of Hypocrites,
That Satan sent with lying spirits,
In Earth this many day.
42
For to advance their fained fame,
Of Jesus they usurp their name,
And yet they traitors think no shame,
His truth for to betray.
More meet of Judas Iudaites,
Or of Sus suis be calde suites,
Ad volutabrum of Romes ruites,
They had their name perfay.
43
For Jesuits in general,
Are traitors to Christ Jesus all:
And seek to gar his Kingdom fall,
With all the might they may.
Omitting none occasion,
To further their invasion.
By pestilent persuasion,
Both by night and day.
44
Their doctrine is but Papistrie.
Set out with subtle Sophistry,
Founded to foster Idolatry,
By learned leys always.
For to maintain the Popes Empire,
They are vpholden with his hyre:
But at the length into the mire,
Both he and they shall faa.
45
They have forsaken the wholesome strands,
Of Gods own word, and his Commands,
And dug up with feet and hands,
And Padels of Papists Laa.
And though they drink while that they bu^^st,
Those pooles shall never s^aike their thirst:
But make their souls (drink as they list)
More dry from day to day.
46
The fond opinions of Papistrie,
In every point particularly,
Are else confuted cunningly,
By more than one or two.
It were but labor then in vain,
To tread the same over again:
Christ's written word has so them slain
They have no more to say,
47
Yet they pretend Antiquity,
So do they discens Linallie,
And local Visibilitie,
From Christ unto this day.
In Christ's time no Papistrie:
They are degenerate wholly,
And brook that place by tyranny,
Against Christ every day.
48
And to perform their interprise:
They leave not off with once or twice:
But up again they mint to rise,
The truth to stope and stay,
But when that Light they cannot sm^re,
Which in their spite shines more and more,
This is the last they make them fore.
True teachers to mislay.
49
These truethlesse trukers without all shame,
Name sundry Pastors by their name:
Them and their Doctrine to defame,
Loud lies abroad they lay.
The Jews, they calde our Sovereign
Possessed, sinful Samaritane,
Yea, Drunkard, and vylde Publicane,
Who knew no sin at aa.
50
No servant is above his Lord,
To bide such bragges: then make us ford,
Remembering aye our Masters word.
Who shewde it should be sa.
Since it is for the trueths own sake,
The godly will no slander take,
What ever leasings these Liars make.
On one, or yet on aa.
51
Full many of our Nation, Scots,
Spread daily forth of their foul spots:
Who would be glade to cut our throats,
If they might see their day.
Yet though they would our bodies slay,
(If we may lawful for them pray)
We would them show in the right way
Of Christ, and of his Laa.
52
Though they have pleasure in despite,
Which they spue out by word and write,
In such pastime we not delight,
Neither in earnst or play.
This God does know, good men perceiues,
If we speak ought against these Knaves,
Their lies and raylings this same reaues,
Out of our hands this day.
53
The other sort do swerue in life,
In whom all sin abounds rise:
Who will not mend, but stir up strife,
Against the Kirk always.
And for their vicious vilanie,
And this kind of Apostasy,
The pure Kirk from her company,
Does cut off every day.
54
That is the true Catholic Kirk,
Of Gods own word that does not irke,
But thereto frames all that they work,
Both Faith and Fact alswa.
Our Kirk is builded thereon sure,
and shall by Gods good grace endure:
But Romish Kirk that Babels Hoore,
Has cast it clean away.
55
Can she be calde a faithful Spouse,
^er Husbands word that no ways trowes,
^or at his bidding never bows,
But still does disobey?
^o more can Romish Synagogue,
^ee calde the Spouse and Kirk of God:
^or Dan, Bethell, Gog, or Magog,
That did forsake his Lay.
56
They will not make the Scripture Judge,
^or them they should find no refuge:
^ut from their lurking gart deludge,
And leasings lay away.
^it will be Judges unto it,
^^d wrest it to their worldly wit:
And so in men's conscience sit,
As Antichrists this day.
57
Fifth, Antichrist shall be revealed,
That man of sin, Satan's child,
And by the Sprite of Christ be kilde,
His breath it shall him slay.
And make that Monster manifest,
Which has the Kirk of Christ oppressed:
And Christ's place proudly possessed,
On Earth this many a day.
58
That same is very Antichrist,
Whose law and life is contrare Christ's:
And Christ's Sheep does boast and tyst,
From Christ to come away.
And him embrace in Christ's stead,
Of Kirk as universal Head,
And keep the statutes he has made,
Contrary to Gods Laa.
59
Though Antichrists full many been,
Since Christ's time, as may be seen,
Was never Antichrist so keen,
As is the Pope this day.
The Kirk of Christ for to deceive,
And Christ's glore to steal and reane:
Most craftily he plays the Knave,
Above all other this day.
60
Of servants Styles him seruiture,
Yet he usurps Divine honors,
And makes all, both xich and poor,
On groufe before him faa.
And will no nearer them admit,
But kiss the Pantone on his feet,
When he upon his throne does sit,
As Antichrist each day.
61
If there were made comparison,
Twixt Christ, and this companion,
Great would be that division,
Should be between them two.
In every point contrarious,
The Pope is to the Lord Jesus:
Should he not then be odious,
To faithful, one and aa?
62
Christ is the Son of Verity,
Begotten of God eternally,
Sent to the world to show mercy,
On all that on him caa.
The Pope the son of Lucifiere,
The father of lies, and first lier:
Most like his father a murderier,
Of all that Christ will knaa.
63
Christ being God in Deity,
To show his great humanity,
Came Man in our humility,
From Hell to save us aa.
The Pope a man of earth, earthly,
To show his pridfull tyranny,
Will be like God in dignity,
To lose himself and aa.
64
Christ would not be an earthly King,
Nor yet a Judge in worldly thing,
But had his pleasure in publishing,
His Fathers will and Laa.
The Pope a worldly King will be,
Yea, more, a mixed Monarchy,
To that effect has Crowns three,
And both the swords will draa,
65
Christ did abhor Idolatry,
So did he vain Hypocrisy,
And used but simplicity,
Into his Kirk always.
The Pope maintains Imageries,
Wide Coules, side Caps, with Philatries:
With shauing, jowking, and juglaries,
Into the Kirk each day.
66
Christ made but once a Sacrifice,
Whereby so full he paid our price,
We need no more to purge our vice,
Nor it make over each day.
The Pope will it not have alone,
But Sacrifices many one:
And als the same made over again:
By his Mass Priest each day.
67
Christ taught Justification,
To come freely by Faith alone,
Without any satisfaction,
Of our Works any way.
The Pope with his corrupted Clerks,
Apply a great part to their works,
Such evil seed their wicked sparks,
Sow in the Kirk this day.
68
Christ preached full remission.
From fault and pain solution,
To all of true contrition,
On him that fixed their Fay.
The Pope affirms, that pain remains
In Purgatory, that place of pains,
And never slakes, till he get gains,
To take the pain away.
69
Christ bade all people more and min,
Come unto him, oppressed with sin,
He shall them of that burden twin,
It freely take away.
The Pope bids all oppressed with sins,
Come buy his pardons in sheep Skins,
They are best heard that first begins
And offers most that day.
70
Christ bade us all our prayers frame,
To God above, and in his Name,
Assuring us t'obtaine the same,
Our askings, one and aa.
The Pope bids, pray to creatures,
In name of more mediatures:
Or otherwise he us assures,
We shall get naught at aa.
71
Christ knew no prayer for the dead,
^ince faithful from all pain are fred:
and for the damned no remead,
After they go away.
The Pope, for dead folk bids all pray,
^o ease their pain in purgatory:
Soule-masse, and drierie Dirigie,
To take their pain away.
72
Christ into his New Testament,
Ordained not a Sacrament,
Safe Baptism, and the Supper meant,
These two but any more.
The Pope to these has added five,
And Sacraments made seven beliue,
So as he lists does clampe and ryue,
Christ's ordinances each day.
73
Christ lawful Marriage approved,
To eat all meats all men lieued,
That no man's conscience should be grieved,
No state, no time, no day.
The Pope forbids Matrimony,
To all estates of his Clergy:
And who eats flesh, sins, deadly:
In Lent, or on friday.
74
Christ came to break the bond of sin,
And gave none leave to lie therein,
But bade all mend, both more and min,
And lay that yoke away.
The Pope to sin gives liberty,
To Bordels, and vylde lechery,
Which pays him yearly tributie,
In Romes town this day.
75
Then his Religion is impure,
A monstrous Mask, and vylde mixture,
Of Gentiles Rites, and Jews for sure,
And made us, of these two.
And eke his life licentious,
A world of vices monstrous,
Is both to Christ contrarious,
What then should we him caa?
76
For Antichrist since he is knawne,
And sinful secrets all forth shawne,
Whereby he has this long time drawn,
The flock from Christ away.
Let us, therefore, in time look up,
And drink no longer of his cupe,
Lest of these plagues we feel the whip,
Which shall him wrack for aye,
77
Last, for the calling of the Jews,
To Christ their King and sprituall Spouse
Their's sundry of that sort that bows,
Unto the Faith each day.
And if the Jews convert not all,
Of this let bs assure our sell,
That his Elect the Lord shall call,
Of them before that day.
78
For of that people rebellious,
God has now called Tremellious,
^ convert most commodious,
Unto his Kirk this day.
Most learned in the Hebrwe phrase,
That was since the Apostles days,
The Bible does give him that praise
Which he translated this day,
79
Now since the tokens all and some,
^re come, and few or none to come:
We should not be like blind and dumb,
That nothing can persaa.
But should be marking evermore,
Both with our eye, and with our ear:
Lest that the Lord come at unware,
And call us to that day.
80
And though that day be horrible,
To Faythlesse wratches miseable,
And to contemners terrible,
And gar them cry and say,
O Craigs, and Mountains monstrous,
Fall down at once, and cover us,
From that just Lamb, the Lord Jesus,
Who shall us judge this day.
81
Let not the Faithful be dismaide,
Nor of that day be ought affraide:
But joyfully lift up their head,
To meet their Groom that day.
And when they see the signs appear,
Let them rejoice, and make good cheer,
For their Redeemer draws near,
Who shall them bless for aye.
82
Their buried bodies he shall raise,
From earth unto eternal ease,
And in a moment change all these,
That be alive that day:
They shall be rest into the air.
To meet that King shall end their fair,
And give them joy for euermaire,
Which never shall decay.
83
For then shall this corruption,
Be cled with incorruption,
And this mortality put on,
Immortality for aye.
Then shall the soul be satiate,
When body is resussitate:
And with their head glorificate,
Triumphantly that day.
84
No sorrow shall be in their spleine,
And all tears wyped from their eine:
Both soul and body then shall shiene,
Like Sun in Summers day.
When they shall get that Crown of glore,
Preparde for them so long before:
Which they shall brook for evermore,
Without change or delay.
85
Though this be calde the VVinters Night,
It is a very Lamp of Light,
To guide us to the Heaven aright,
By Christ the only way.
Then meet it were we did it clear,
And had the same in prompe perquiere,
This Winter Night it ends here,
To God be praise for ay.
86
Christ Prince of Pastors defend and keep,
The little Flock of thy poor Sheep,
From Satan, that does never sleep,
But waits them night and day.
and from all earthly enmity,
from bloody Papists especially,
Who both by craft and cruelty,
Seek to destroy them aa.
87
God save the Kings Majesty,
Thy graces on him multiply,
That he may know his duty,
And do the same alswa.
Thy blessed word to fortify,
And purge this Realm of Papistrie,
And to do Justice equally,
Both to the great and smaa.
88
God grant him in his perfect age,
A virtuous Queen in marriage:
Come of a godly Parentage,
That yoke with him to draw,
And grant them good posterity,
To know and love the verity,
To reign^ and rule in his Country,
So long as day does daa,
89
Court, Counsel, and Nobility,
Lord, purge from all Impiety,
And namely from Hypocrisy,
And Avarice with aa.
And as their hearts mean inwardly,
To thee, and to his Majesty,
To thy pure Kirk, and this Country,
Reward them one and aa.
90
Bless, Lord, thy Pastors Spiritual,
With gifts supernatural:
That thy true word they may us tell,
A^^^^ed with man's laa.
Yea, shining lights, and sauorie salt,
In word and deed they may be that,
And Christ's cause stoutly to debate,
Say contrare who will say.
91
Purge, Lord, thy Kirk, and make it clean,
From Baalams Priests, that therein been,
Who not thy glory, but their own mean,
And vantage all the way.
Lord, make the King once understand,
The great corruptions in that band,
Them to reform he may hold hand,
According to thy Laa.
92
And from dumb Dogs that cannot bark:
From wastefull Bees, tha^ ^ake no warke:
^Vho never aim at the right mark,
(Lord purge thy Kirk this day)
^hey suppe the Milk, and worrie the You,
^o fill their idle bellies fow:
^oth slocke and heard they pluck and pow,
Most cruelly this day.
From Idolater and Hypocrite*
from Athist, Papist, and Jesuit,
^^d from the vsurs of Satan's sprite,
By Witch-crafe any way,
^^om oppression, Murder, and Mischief,
^^om Belly gods, from Hoore and Thief,
^^om Avarice, of others chief,
Lord, purge this Land this day,
^4
Inspire the common Populare.
^^^pire their heart, and open their ear,
That they may hear thy word with fear,
Believe and eke obey.
Lord make us thankful unto thee,
That blessed sight hast^ let us see.
And grant us therein constancy,
How ever you us faa.
^^
Glore to the Father full of might,
Glore to the Son our Day so bright:
Glore to the holy Ghost* that Light,
That lets us see our Day,
One GOD equal in Majesty:
And yet distinct in persons three.
As was, is now, and aye, shall be.
Beyond all Night and Day.
So be it* even So be it.
