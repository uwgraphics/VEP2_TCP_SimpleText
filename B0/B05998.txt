This following Address (which was signed by 86 Gentleman and others) was
delivered by Colonel Stroud, Governor of Dover Castle, to His Majesty, before
he went to Windsor.
To the King's most Excellent Majesty. The Humble Address of the truly Loyal
Subjects of the Town and Port of Dover.
May it please your Majesty,
WE your Majesty's Humble, Loyal, and Dutiful Subjects, having a deep sense of
your unparalled Tenderness toward, and care for your People, both in
Relation of their sacred and civil Concerns, and of that Peace and Happiness we
have hitherto enjoyed under your Majesty's most Auspicious and Prudent
Government; which inestimable Blessing we were in danger to be deprived of, if
your sacred Majesty's great Wisdom, Care and Authority had not timely prevented
it: The clear demonstration hereof is apparent to all the World, by your
Majesty's most excellent and gracious Declaration received, as to the whole and
every part of it, with all imaginable Joy, and unexpressible Satisfaction by
your Majesty's Truly Loyal People.

For this Your Royal Favor, We humbly beg, Your Majesty to accept of our most
dutiful, hearty and unseigned Thanks, and grateful Acknowledgment; And we do
promise and vow in the presence of Almighty God, And declare before all the
world, that We tender our Lives and Fortunes, as an Eucharistick Oblation to
Your Majesty, for the Preservation of Your Sacred Person, Maintenance of the
Protestant Religion, as now Established by Law, and the Succession of the
Imperial Grown of England in its due and Legal course of Descent.

The God of Heaven Prolong your Majesty's Days, Bless you with Health and
Happiness, Establish your Sacred Person and Government in the Hearts and
Affection of your People, and continue the British Monarchy within the Royal
Family; till Time shall be no more. Your Sacred Majesty's most Humble, Loyal,
Dutiful and Obedient Subjects.
