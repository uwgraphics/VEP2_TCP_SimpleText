A Pleasant Dialogue betwixt Two VVanton Ladies of Pleasure; Or, The Duchess
of Porsmouths woeful Farwell to her former Felicity.
One Lady she Courageously stands in her own defense; The other now does seem
to bow, her Colors are displayed,
Assuredly none can deny, the Words she speaks is sense: She is content, her
mind is bent, still to maintain her Trade.
Tune of, Tan tarra rara, tan tivee.




BRave Gallants now listen and I will you tell
with a fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la,
A pleasant discourse that I heard at Pell-mell,
with a fa la, etc.
Between two fair Ladys of the wanton strain,
The one to the other did sigh and complain,
I wish I was over in France now again,
with a fa la, etc.
Quoth Nelly I prithee who sent for thee here,
with a fa la, etc.
It Is you with a shame that put in for a share
with a fa la, etc.
O do you remember when I was dismayed,
When you in attire was richly arrayed,
Alas I poor Nelly was wronged in my trade,
with a fa la, etc.
I pray now could you not your honor advance,
with a fa la, etc.
With some noble Peer, in the Nation of France,
with a fa la, etc.
Forsooth you must needs leave your country dear
To utter your fine french Commodity here,
But sorrow and trouble will bring up the rear,
with a fa la etc.
Dear Nelly be-loving and do not reflect,
with a fa la etc.
But prithee now show me some civil respect,
with a fa la etc.

For shame will not let me uncover my face
My honor is turned to a vail of disgrace.
with a fa la, etc.
Quoth Nelly, pray send for the treasure again,
with a fa la, etc.
That you did send over while you were in fame,
with a fa la, etc.
Come, come, I must tell ye that you was too bold
To send from this Nation such parcels of gold,
In such kind of dealings you must be controlled,
with a fa la, etc.
No sweet Madam Nelly, you cannot deny,
with a fa la, etc.
But you have had treasure as often as I,

And yet must I only indeed be run down,
By you that I value the least in the town,
If I come in favor upon thee i will frown,
with a fa la, etc.
You drab of a Miss, I do hold you in scorn
with a fa la, etc.
I Would have you to know I am this Nation born,

Of many good bout I Have been cheated by you,
For which may a Thousand vexations ensue,

No matter for that it was all my delight,
with a fa la, etc.
But now I am in a most pitiful plight,
with a fa la, etc.
Unfortunate Lady that now am denied,
In this vail of sorrow my patience is tried,
Sure this may be termed the downfall of pride,
with a fa la, etc.
I Will warrant you thought it would never be day,
with a fa la, etc.
But now you are utterly fell to decay,
with a fa la, etc.
You are in a sad and deplorable state,
You wander alone now for want of a Mate,
Your'e like an old Almanac quite out of date,

No Nelly, I will not be clearly dismayed,
with a fa la, etc.
I Will set a good face and will follow my trade,

I Will have youthful damsels to ply on the scour,
I Will play a small game now before i will stick out,
with a fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la.
