BOCHIM.
Sighs poured out by some troubled Hearts, and tendered toward continuing the
precious savor of the good Name of the late worthy Man of God, JOHN VERNON,
who having faithfully served his Generation, and finished his Testimony, by the
Will of God, fell asleep the twenty ninth day of the third Month, 1667.
An ACROSTICK.
JEHOVAH, Lord, Oh what is the cause that thou
On Sions back such furrows deep do plow?
Here have thou smote her sore, this wound is deep,
Now in disposing thy dear JOHN to sleep.
VERNON that Son of Oil, renowned Plant;
Eliah's Spirit had; that royal Saint.
Right for thee kept by grace throughout his day,
Now in his flowred strength have called away.
On Willow Trees Saints Harps do hang this day.
Now naught but tears; sweet Lord then have away.
Per J. T.
AN ELEGY.
IS VERNON also gone? what, after Glass?
Call for the mourning women, say alas,
Who ever can this loss and breach repair,
For Souls and Bodies who like him shall care?
To both (as LVKE) he was beloved Physician,
And made for sin his closest Inquisition.
He clothed the naked, and the poor he fed;
This man of bowels death has captive led.
In Worship he abhorred humane invention,
And so was thought a man of great contention*
(In Church and State) against Apostates all,
(Both Beast and Whore) he had a holy Gall.
For which he was deprived, vexed, and oppressed;
But now is slipped aside, hid and at rest.
And though, Eliah like, he had some passion,
He did excel in bowels of compassion.
For he to build an house his stock did spend,
(Not for himself) but Sion to befriend.
Breach upon breach; Ah what is Gods intent?
To smite our Shepherds thus! What sin is meant?
What duty, or what lesson is expected?
Let (by a double spirit) be effected;
His empty place and Family supply,
His Friends support, and fit us all to die.
Per J. M.
A SOLILOQUIE.
Psalm. 77.6. I call to remembrance my Song in the Night. I commune with my own
Heart, and my Spirit made diligent search.
WHat ails thee, my poor grieved mind,
That thou lie lingering thus behind?
As listless to attend the Hearse
Of thy choice Friend with mournful verse?
Others dexterity should be
An argument to quicken thee.
Nay importunities should move,
Besides thine own constraints of love:
Shake off dull melancholy then,
Handle the ready VVriters Pen.
Alas, nor heart, nor hand is strong,
To utter a becoming Song;
It Is irk some work, (my friends may think)
While gall and vinegar I drink;
While evidently all may see
God writes those bitter things to me;
Puts me to silence with disgrace,
Shuts out my cry, spits in my face.
It seems improper, such a time,
To speak heartbreaking thoughts in Rhyme.
It Is true, if any should advise,
Thy putting forth in wonted guise;
To deck the Tombs, or spread the praise,
Of men debauched all their days.
In Righteousness thou should decline,
The offering any help of thine.
But here is nothing else designed,
Then bring to light, and keep in mind,
The Grace that did a Worm engage,
To be Gods Witness in his Age.
In a great strait indeed am I,
It Is hard to grant, hard to deny;
My willing mind would show regard,
My sinful heart and hand retard.
I would attempt, but then I fear,
I Grace shall rather cloud then clear:
However I can do no less,
Then show what thoughts my mind impress;
Set forth his worth to Friends and Foes,
Exhort this Age, and therewith close.
JOHN VERNON, Anag.
For Christ was hunted, grieved, disgraced;
With Christ is In New Honor placed.

How swift the ruins of this old World haste,
Whilst in nue honor Saints so swift are placed.

An ANAGRAM and ELEGY, on his dear deceased Friend, John Vernon.
JOHN VERNON, Anagram, VINE ON HORN.
How, Vine on Horn? these things do not agree
In course of nature; pray you let us see
How spiritualized they together stand,
To answer here unto our case in hand.
Isa. 5.1, 2. Jer. 2.21. Psalm. 60.15. Luke 1.69. Romans 11.17, 24. and 6.5. Joh.
12.28, 29. Psa. 18.2. P. 92.10. Jo. 17.10. Romans 8,9 1 John 2.3. Isa. 26.4.
Psalm. 138.8. Isa. 35.10.
SAints God calls Vines,and CHRIST is called a Horn,
On which all Saints are planted, cannot be torn
From him again, though they be weak as Vine.
This Horn supports, supplies, says, these are mine;
And shall yet more be known, as his at length,
Because this Horn has everlasting strength,
To bring all things to pass to them belongs,
And fill their mouth's with everlasting Songs.
Jer. 2, 21. Psalm. 92.10, 23, 5. 1 John 2.27. 2 Cor. 3.5, 6. Genesis 49.22. Ps.
92.12, 13, 14. Hos. 14.5.6 Genesis 40.23. Psalm. 64.4. Psalm. 109.31. Acts 7.9.
Psalm. 56.1, 2, 5, 6. Psalm. 41.5, 6, 7, 9. with 55.12, 13, 14. Psalm. 35.12.
Jer. 13.16, 17.
But ah, this Vine's cut down, this noble Vine,
That fresh Oil from this Horn did make to shine;
With which he was indeed so well anointed,
As made him meet for what he was appointed;
A fruitful bough he was, by Well and Wall,
Which did supply, support, made him grow tall.
The Archers sorely shot, did hate, and grieve
His tender Soul, but God did him relieve.
How many shock's from sinners, and from Saints
Did he sustain, producing sad complaints
To God his God, when men would not regard,
But all his love and labor ill reward.
His Soul did mourn in secret for such pride
John 7.37. Phil. 2.21. 2 Timothy 3.5. 1 Pet. 1.4. Isa. 24.5.14.57.9. Jer. 2.23.
Mal. 3.7. Jer. 9.1, 8, 21. Ezekiel. 21.6 9.4.
He found with many long before he di'd;
To see a worldly, formal, selfish spirit,
Amongst men professing Heaven to inherit.
Defilements deep, declining, and debasing;
Facings about, and yet in all out-facing;
Such gashings made our tender Vine to weep,
Sigh, sorrow, deeply, till he fell a sleep.
Isa. 22.12. Jer, 9.17. Ezekiel. 21.3, 4. Joel 3.16. Psalm. 42.7. Psalm. 88.7.
Mourn Sions Saints, oh mourn and weep full sore,
Our Vine's cut down, God does in Sion roar:
Oh, what is the cause, deep calls thus unto deep?
And all his Billows over us do creep?
Death's of the choicest Saints, like mighty Waves
Luke 16.30. 1 Cor. 11.30.
Roll on upon us, calling to the Graves,
To hear from thence what dead to living say,
Who tell us why they could no longer stay.
Heb. 11.4.
Though dead, yet speak they do, and we must hear
Some sad things from them, yet, I greatly fear.
Psalm. 8.8. 1 Timothy 4.6. 1 Cor. 3.17. Psalm. 23.1, 2. Rev. 7.17. 2 Cor. 6.2, 3.
Isa. 5.1, 2. Mic. 4.4. Ezekiel. 14.23, 24, 16.
Dear Congregation, when this Vine did flourish,
Do you consider God made him to nourish,
Succor, support, with wholesome food to feed you,
And by the streams of living Waters lead you;
Ah, did you prize, improve this precious time,
When God thus set you under your own Vine;
What means a first, a second, and a third,
Mic. 6.9. Jer. 8.6.
So soon snach't from you, search, is there no word
From God, of sin, nor duty that you hear?
Oh speak aright, as persons in his fear.
Jer. 9.17. Lam. 5.15. Acts 4.36. Job 29.16. v. 11.2.25. Phil. 2.20. 2 Cor.
11.28. Luke 10.36, 37. Psalm. 37.21, 26. Isa. 32.8.
Let Widows, Orphans, all distressed ones join
In this sad Lamentation, for the Vine,
Who so refreshed bowels disconsolate,
Sought out, and succored them at such a rate;
As few like minded left, so truly caring,
Pains, Purse, and Person, he so little sparing,
To Bodies, Souls of many to do good,
He did devise, and by devising, stood.
2 Chronicles. 34.27. Ephesians. 4.32 Rev. 2.2. Psalm. 119.138. 2 Pet. 2.8. Jer. 9.30.
Let differing Brethren also bear a part,
From whom he did withdraw; Alas his heart
Being truly tender, could not bear to see
Defilements rise unto such high degree;
Such cowardice, not valor for the Truth,
Has been his Souls great burden from his youth.
Admit in some part here he might be weak,
Isa. 5.17. Isa. 52.15. Jude 15. Job 42.7. 1 Cor. 4.3, 4, 5.
He was a man; but oh when God shall speak,
And you shall hear, he will make you understand,
That your hard speeches crossed his Command;
And that you spoke not of his Vine aright,
As you may think you have, whilst it is night.
Luke 23.31. 2 Chronicles. 34.27, 28. Mal. 3.3. Prove. 25.4. Isa. 1.25. Jer. 6.28,
29. Acts 13.41. Ps. 5.12. Isa. 31.7. Isa. 2.18. Romans 11.18. Hos. 14.8. Isa.
19.1. 1 Pet. 4.17. Jer. 29.12, 13. 1 Cor. 3.12. 1 Pet. 2.4, 5, 6. Deuteronomy 32.39. 1 Samuel 2.6. Heb. 13.8. Mal. 3.6. Heb. 1.11, 12. Job 1.21.
Let Us all consider, look about, and see,
What God, our God has done to this green Tree!
And fear, and tremble, more remains behind
Of Fire, and Fullers-soap, whereby refined
Must be such rusty Vessels, yet remaining,
As we are under all, so little gaining.
Let Us all take heed of slighting or despising,
Unduely setting up, or idolizing
Most fruitful Boughs; it is the Horn that bears,
And for abusings, every way thus tears,
And rends, and goes away unto his place,
Till sense of guilt shall make us seek his face;
He bears the Building, he must wear the Crown,
It is his right to raise up and cast down:
He changes not, abides still the same,
In all our changes, praise his holy Name.
W. A.
