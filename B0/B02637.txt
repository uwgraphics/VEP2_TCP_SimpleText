Darby-shires Glory.
To the Tune of, I am a Jovial Batchellor.


OLd England many Countries has
of Fame and great Renown;
But Darbyshire for Wool and Lead
all others does put down:
For Young Men neat,
And Maids complete,
All those that have been there,
Will Boldly swear,
None can compare
With famous Darbyshere.
In Yorkshire it is reported,
there is store of Bread and Beef;
And Cheshire, as I hear them say,
for Men it is the Cheef:
There Is Lancashire abounds
for Fair Women, they say;
But Darbyshire for Wool and Lead,
does bear the Bell away.
Their Sheep they feed in Pastures good,
upon the pleasant Plain:
There is great store of Coals and Wood,
besides all sorts of Grain.
And Clothes mostbrave
Likewise they have,
That is both fresh and fair:
Which makes, etc.
In other Countries I have heard tell
of the Fame of Darby Man't;
For let them make the best they can,
they of it come far short.
It bears the Bell,
As I have heard tell,
Of all both far and near;
Which makes me swear,
None can compare
With famous Darby-shire,
And then such Drink of this same Malt
the Brewers they do make,
Will make an old Woman's Tongue to talk,
and a Cat almost to speak:
It will do them good,
And warm their Blood,
That drinks but of this Beer;
Which makes me swear,
None can compare
With famous Darby-shire.
The Grovers they do work full hard
within the Stony Ground,
(Although with Stones they are debarred)
till they their Ore have found:
Then with their Prize away they bye
to take a Glass of Beer:
Which makes, etc.
In Darby, which is the County Town,
there is a Castle strong;
Which many an arrant Rogue has known,
that has done his Neighbors wrong.
And the County Sheriff does ride in State,
with Trumpets sounding clear:
Which makes, etc.
There is Heafeild Hope, and Tidswal,
(as I have heard many tell)
For Fairs and merry Meetings,
all others does excel.
The Young Men and Maids,
With their Comrades,
Will Dance and Sing most rare:
Which makes, etc.
Their is great Hunting every year,
not far from Tidswall Town,
To which brave Gentlemen repair,
and Men of high Renown:
To the Mo^res they are bound,
With Horse and Hound,
To chase the nimble Hare:
Which makes, etc.
There is the Chapel of Frith likewise,
it I must not forget
There is proper young men comes to Town,
and Maidens very neat:
Then at the Thorn,
They Are not think scorn,
To take a Cup of Beer:
Which makes, etc.
The Wonders of the world I think,
at Buxtons may be found;
While a white pound of Candles burn,
one may walk under the Ground.
Then there is Well,
(As I have heard tell)
For Virtues very rare:
Which makes, etc,
There is Fishing, and there is Fowling,
likewise at Backwall Town;
There is Hunting, and there is Bowling
both up the Hills and down.
All Recreations lawful and civil,
they use there;
Which makes, etc.
And now my Song for to conclude,
I here do make an End;
Sure every one that is not rude,
will take me for his Friend:
Then buy then all, both Great and Small,
the Purchase is not dear,
When for one Penny you may have
The Fame of Darby-shere.
FINIS.
