A merry Discourse between Norfolk Thomas, and Sisly Standtoo't his Wife;
Together with their thanklesse journey from Norfolk to London, only to see
their friends, and how they do respect and entertain 'um for their love and
labor.
Which shows that this same Age most certain true,
Is only for to ask ye how ye do.
To the tune of the Spanish Pavin.




Thomas. TO London is mad Thomas come,
With Sisly here, his Wife alone,
To see some friends, I hear are gone,
to heaven a while ago.
But I do hope it is a lie,
As I shall find it by and by,
Or else poor Tom and Sisse should cry,
till Doomes-day.
For though they be none of the best,
I should be loath I do protest,
To hear that they are gone to rest,
and never take their leave.
For I do love 'um all so well,
A little thing would make me dwell,
Within the sounding of Bow-bell,
at London.

Sisly. Nay husband do not you say so,
Our Cottage poor we will not forgo,
For the best house that stands aroe,
'twixt Cheap and Charing Cross.
For though our house be thatch't with Straw,
We do not live as some in awe,
For it is our own by Common law,
in Norfolk.
Besides we live at hearts content,
We take no care to pay our Rent,
For that is done incontinent
or twinkling of an eye.
When here at London as they say,
They brawle and brable every day,
And few or none but finds a way
to Hogdsdon.

Thomas. Mum Sisly keep your Clapper still
There Is them can hear at Hygat hill,
There Is Rats has been in Peggies Mill,
or else she lies her self.
What if the world be vilde and bad,
Shall I be such a foolish Lad
To blaze and noise it all abroad,
I scorn it.
Although, indeed I must confess,
Thou speak but truth my honest Sisse,
Yet ever while you live, mark this,
and take it for a rule.
That every Chimney must not smoke,
Nor every Beggar wear a Cloak,
Nor every truth must not be spoke,
in sadness.
But hang that Cobbler and his Ends,
That lives too well and never mends,
Wood they were whipped that nere offends,
peace Chuck, I mean not thee.
For thou will scold sometime I know,
The more is Thomas Standtoots woe,
But hang it; come lets trip and go to
Fleetstreet.
And thus they trudged along the street,
With many a justle they did meet,
Which put poor Thomas in a sweat,
and something angry to.
Which made him think they told a lie
That said there did so many dye,
When as he could not go hardly,
for people,

Sisly. At length quoth she, good husband stay
And tell me what this place is pray,
Where things are carried as they may,
I never saw the like.
For yonder is one does ride in state,
And hears a Beggar at a gate
And there is a woman that will prate
for nothing.
See here is one that soundly beats,
And thumps his Hemp until he sweats,
And there is another greedy eats,
I fear he will choke himself,
And yonder goes a gallant bilk,
And there is a woman winding silk,
And hears another fetches milk
at Hackney.
But here is the prettiest sight of all,
A woman that is mighty tall,
And yet her Spouse a little squall,
I wonder how they met.
And here is a man in Armor stands,
That has it seems lost both his hands,
It Is pity that he has no lands
to keep him.

Now you must by this time suppose them about the Exchange.

The second part.
To the same tune.




ANd here is a world of people fine,
That do in Silks and Satins shine,
I wood that Suite and Cloak were mine,
I hope I wish no harm.
And here hangs Pictures two or three,
The best that ever I did see,
I think one looks full butt at me,
and laughs too.
And here is a man has many a Rat,
Both in his hand, and on his Hat,
Me thinks he keeps 'um very fat,
O strange what tails they have.
And here is a Gentle-women too,
That hides her face from me and you,
I wonder what she means to do
in Summer.
And here is an empty Church I see,
Great pity it is most certainly,
It should indeed no fuller be,
and all these people here.
And there is an old man carries wood,
And here is a young man does no good,
And here is a woman wears a hood,
hey Dazie.

Thomas. Come Sisly let us go along
And not stand gaping hear among
A sort of people that do throng,
I never saw the like.
But let us to our brother go,
That will us welcome well I know,
For he himself did tell me so,
at Norfolk.
Soft, let us knock for here is the door,
But if because our clothes be poor,
They should not let us in therefore,
t'wod make a dog to laugh.
For I have heard my mother say,
That if a man fall to decay,
There Is few or none will bid him stay,
you are welcome.
But silence, not a word but mum,
For see our brother now does come,
Me thinks he looks as he were dum,
what makes him not to speak.
Good brother we our loves unfold,
For though my Sisse and I am old,
Yet we have made a little bold
to see you.

Brother. And truly I do thank you for it,
Ye'r welcome both with all my heart,
We Will drink a Cup before we part,
ant please you but to stay.
For I have friends within truly,
That if they should a stranger see,
They strait woo very fearful be
of danger.

Thomas. Why Brother we no sickness have,
Nor are we started from our grave,
Your love is all that we do crave,
what need you then to fear,
We do not come to eat your roast
Nor yet to put you unto cost,
But now I see our labors lost
poor Sisly.

Brother. Pray do not think the fault is mine,
For if you will drink a Pint of wine,
I Will give it you, and nere repine,
hang money what care I.
And had I not so many Guess,
Indeed I seriously profess,
Your welcome should be more or less,
good Brother.

Thomas. No thank you Brother, eene farewell,
A blind man now with ease may smell,
That all things is not carried well,
what love pray call you this.
Come now unto thy Sister we
^ill go with all selerity,
No doubt that she shall kinder be,
unto us.

They condescend and were content
So to their Sister straight they went,
But all in vain their time was spent
for when they thither came.
Their Sister did her Maid compel,
And bid her thus much to them tell,
Indeed she was not very well,
at that time.
From thence they to their cousen go,
Being much desirous for to know,
Whether that she wood serve 'um so.
or use 'um in that kind.
But being there this news was brought,
That she a smock had newly bought,
And she was gone to have it wrought
with Woosted.
Well now says Thomas to his Dear,
What say thou Sisly to this gear,
We far have gone, yet nere the near,
We thank our kindred for it.
But if that brothers be so kind
What favor shall a stranger find,
Protest it troubles much my mind,
to think on it.

Sisly. Nay Husband let us not do so,
The best is we can homewards go,
And yet not trouble friend nor foe,
what need we then to care.
For now each one I tell you true,
Will only ask you how do you,
I am glad to see you well, Sir Hugh,
good morrow.

Thomas. Why then old Sisly thou and I,
Will back again to Norfolk hie,
And bid a fig for company:
our Dog is sport enough.
But when we come to London next,
Our friends shall have a better Text,
I swear and vow I am soundly vexed,
who cares for it.
