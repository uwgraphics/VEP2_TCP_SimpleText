The Contented PILGRIM: Or, The Pilgrims troublesome Journey to his long home.
He waits with patience and is well content,
And desires all Christian people to repent,
For the blessed soul that intends to Heaven to go,
Must work with patience whether he will or no.
Tune is, Let patience work for me.
This may be printed,

R. L. S.







I Am a poor Pilgrim in this life,
And tossed with misery;
There Is nothing here but care and strife
with the poorer sort we see.
Let who will strive for to be great,
it is all but Vanity,
To save our souls let us strive for that,
and let Patience work for me.
In sickness and in poverty,
patience is the best;
Let Us keep the Lords Commandments
then our souls they will be blessed.
And forgo all wicked sinfulness,
which must used we see,
We must not think an evil thought,
and let patience etc.
Let Us not despair in our good God,
what misery we do abide,
But with patience take his blessed Rod,
then God will be our guide;
Ts bring us on in our Pilgrimage,
our blessed Savior he
Did dye for us to save our souls,
and let patience etc.

The glory of this sinful world
comes to nothing at the last,
We are uncertain of our life;
all is Vanity that is past;
Who would be proud of this same world,
all is nothing we do see,
When in the Grave that we are hurled,
and let patience work for me.
What are we when the stroke of death
calls for our life away,
Its nothing but a puff of breath
that makes us here to stay;
Therefore we need to have a care
and do no wrong you see,
But keep Gods laws and love him dear
and let etc.
When he does ring his alarm-bell,
and it sounds in our ears,
Happy's that soul that lived well,
then well it shall appear
Before that blessed Judge of Heaven,
when Sentence there will be,
Come blessed soul, thou art forgiven,
thou art welcome unto me.
Then happy is that blessed soul
that lives in a penitent way;
And patient be in all our wants
in this life I do say;
When death he comes, he takes no bribe,
away from hence go we,
The blessed God be on our side,
and let pa^ience work for me.
If we be cold or hungry,
and maintenance it be scarce,
The Lord he will our wants supply,
and will help us at the last;
We need not fear of any want,
our gracious God is free
To those that love him to be sure,
and let etc.
Now let us keep a watchful eye,
and prepare our souls for death,
Before that we do come to dye,
that death does stop our breath:
That soul that dies that is unprepared,
is in great misery;
God bless us all from the Devils snare
and let patience etc.
Lord give us grace both rich and poor
that we may be content,
For Patience is a goodly store,
if we our sins repent;
Gods servants can not want be sure,
tho poor and bare some be,
Our blessed Lord is sufficient store,
and let patience work for me.
