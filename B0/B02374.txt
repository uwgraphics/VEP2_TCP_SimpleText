A SONG.
ON HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY.
(1)
FOrgive, GREAT SIR! if less we pay,
Then what is due, to this Great Day;
We want Apollo to inspire
Strains, fit to grace your BIRTHDAY Quire.
Blessed Numbers, and imortal Lays,
And Anthems of an endless praise.
Are worthy You; and only fit to be
To You, GREAT SIR! the proper harmony.
(2)
DUTY and LOVE is all our Aim,
And these, and More your Virtues claym:
In all your Crosses who e're Knew,
The least resentment come from you,
In Words, or frowns, or any thing,
Beneath the GRANDEUR of a KING?
In all the turns of Fate, You Act your part,
A KING, like DAVID after GOD'S own heart.
(3)
DUTY, and LOVE is all our Aim,
And these, and more your Virtues claym;
In highest Dangers void of Fear,
Or Pride, when Victories you bear:
Piety, and goodness fill your mind;
Your Foes, when Vanquished Mercy find:
Your Justice may, in Time, Overtake, and Aw
Those Men, your profer'd Kindness cannot draw.
CHORUS:
DUTY, and LOVE is all our Aim,
And these, and More your Virtues claym;
A mighty power, your Kingdoms to regain;
A Goulden Age, And Nestor's years to reign.
By Mr. D. Carney: And set by Mr. Abell Master of his Majestys private Music.
Printed by William Weston Printer and Stationer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. 1694.
