To the Right Honorable THE LORD MAYOR AT THE ANNIVERSARY ENTERTAINMENT IN
GUILDHALL.
THE wise Appllo Laugheth once a year;
So the resembling mortal Gods do here
Deign to be jolly, and Triumph together,
Over their Cares, and over Romes soul weather.
As you (much Honored Sir) Ascend the Chair,
The Heavens so kind and so Propitious are.
Redeemed Religion happily supplies
Fresh Comfort to your former solemn Joys.
Let Popery dashed it sound sweeter in your ear
Than the sweet pleasing melody you hear.
And Hearts as with good wine be cheered and warmed
With the good news His Majesty not harmed;
But this ought to allay your Joys Excess,
His Martyred Friend falls by the merciless.
Now Exit Babylon's Transubstantiation,
Infernal Plots and Hell Assassination;
Those Egypt Frogs no more Infest or Croak
Within the shadow of the Royal Oak.
(Avaunt Prodigious, Protean, Papal-State.)
Avaunt the cursed Raviliack Transmigrate.
The noise of Blood, The noise of Bankrupts cease,
The Nations Wealth, the Nations Fame increase.
This so bright dawning Providential Ray
Sweetly Presageth Sunshine Halcyon day.
And you my Lord, within your Lower Sphere
Are a good Omen. Happy be your year.
On Sir Edmondbury Godfrey.
Such is man's Life and Fickle state,
Consumed with Care, exposed to Hate,
Rent by variety of Fate,
(At most but of a moments Date)
So here in this great Hearse we see,
The best of Mortals, what they be.
The wise and good worst harms molest,
The more of worth, the less of rest.
As in a storm the Cedars fall,
And shrubs survive their Funeral.
