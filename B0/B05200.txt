ACT OF PARLIAMENT, Anent the Coniage of Copper.
At EDINBVRGH, The Ninteenth Day of July, 1690 Years.
THE KING and QUEENS Majesty's, with Consent of the Three Estates Conveen'd in
Parliament, Considering that at this time it may be fit to have some small
Money Conied in Copper, for the easy Exchange and Support of the Poor; and
that the Value allowed by the Twenty Fourth Act of the Parliament 1686 to be
Conied out of the Pound of Copper, viz. Twenty Shilling Scots out of the Pound,
is so little that it will not well repay the Charges, VVaiste and Travail of
the Coniage: DO THEREFORE Allow such a Quantity of Copper to be Conied, as the
KING'S Majesty shall Order, not exceeding Three Thousand Stones of Copper in
the space of Six Years, whereof Two Parts in Two-Penny Pieces, and a Third in
Six-Penny-Pieces, at such a Rate as shall be Appointed by His Majesty, not
exceeding Thirty Shilling Scots in the Pound Weight of Copper: PROVIDING that
the said Quantity of Three Thousand Stones be so divided, as that no more then
Five Hundred Stones be Conied in one Year. AND LIKEWISE, that albeit this
Alteration be now Dispensed with, and Allowed on good Considerations, yet after
that the said Number of Three Thousand Stones of Copper shall be Conied, the
former Act past in anno 1686 shall stand in its full Force as to the matter of
Copper Coin in all Points. And the Estates, Do Humbly Entreat His Majesty may
Recommend to His Privy Council, to take exact Care for Overseeing that no more
be Conied at this Rate, than the said Three Thousand Stones, in such
Proportions as His Majesty shall Prescribe, not exceeding Five Hundred Stones
in One Year, as said is. And they STATUTE and ORDAIN, that the exceeding of the
foresaid Quantity, shall be Punished as False Coniage.
