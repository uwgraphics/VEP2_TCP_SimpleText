EDENBVRGH.

Printed by GEDEON LITHGOW, 1650.

1.
The Heavens have heard our groans at leng^^
Our Prayers have with God prevaild,
and all the damned plots are faild,
Which Hell did hatch with skill and strength,
^reat Charles our Sun (ecclypst almost)
^hines fair on Caledonias coast,
^is beams the blackest clouds do clear,
^he Temples in loud thanks do Sing,
^he Castles pales of Cannon ring,
and Joy does eury Where appear.
2.
^ee how those Helhounds Snarling stand,
those branded Currs that barked of late,
Against this Cuntry, Church and State.
and Curse a far this happy land:
Malicious Mastifs, shame of men,
that durst so long a King detain
from those that su'd Him even with tears;
^ou'd rather seen Him beg His bread
^hen Scotlands Croune set on His head,
Because youd have no Credit there.
3.
That Providence that Sweys the Spheres,
Did pull Him from your filthy claws,
T^o let you sit with gaping Jaws,
And belch out oaths disdain full Ieers,
And if you be but worth a groat
To drink Confusion to the Scott
Lash Lesly, whip Argile, and Spare not,
They in their Kings just cause will go
Where you dare not your faces Show,
And though you hang your Selves they can not.
4.
Go with your renting rascal rabble
Of Colonells coynd Without cloakes,
Stout men in talk if words were Strokes,
And Valiant at a Well Served table:
We hate that damning cursing crew
Whom there oune Cruntry forth did Spew
And who have drawn these Judgments down
There wicked lives, blasphemous toungs,
Oppressions, Villainies, and Wroungs
Have to these fires the bellows bloune.
5.
We hope with help of Heaven alone
With Scottish hands and Valor stout,
To beat those bloody Rogues to route
And set King Charles on Englands Throne,
And with there blood to wash away
That blott they falsely on us lay
That we for monney Sold the Father,
The World our Innocence shall see,
And that those Traitors perfidie,
Deceaud our trust, or Weakness rather.
6.
When England had a Parliament
Complete, composd of honnest men,
Ere knaves and Sectaries began
To work their damnable intent,
The King upon the Solemn oath
Of English Peers was free to both,
The Scots from Tine marchd over Tweed:
Then Rogues rose up, and might made right,
The Soldier against the State did fight
And His oune King a Captive lead.
7.
The Coward City Cuckolds nest,
For all her gunnes cast open Her gates,
And save the Houses fored; the seatts
By Independent Knaves possessed,
Slaves took the power into their hands,
The Nobles couchd at their Commands
The King was carried up and down,
Till from the bar unto the block
The Sacred Head stopped to the stroke
Of a base Axe which felld the Croune.
8.
Arch-Traytors, Tigers, Wolvish dogs,
That durst the Lords anointed kill,
The Sacred blood that you did Spill,
Shall droune your fields to bloody boggs:
Heavens vengeance shall so heavy fall,
On you and your successors all.
That England shall for ever mourn
The ground for corn sour Hemp shall yee^
To Hang you up in every field,
And all your Trees shall gibbets turn.
9.
The Royale ghost shall haunt your Hall,
And horror shall your Souls affright,
Hells sights in silence of the Night
Your guilty Consciences shall gall.
The Scottish sword shall mow you down,
And when your carcasses are throune
On dunghills, for the ravens food,
The stinch of them shall raise a pest
And famine shall consume the rest
To root out your unlucky brood.
10.
But you good souls that sighe to see
A Rascal rabble rule and Reign,
And dare not for your lives complain
Faint not, though you oppressed be.
The happy day will shortly come,
Shall bring your King triumphant home
And bring the Golden Age again
But London must be first laid low
That Charles may ore her ashes go
To hang up Cromwell in a chain.
11.
Rouse up you drousy peevish Peers,
For shame be not for ever slaves
Your place and blood more Courage craves,
Degener not from your Forebe'ers,
They next to God did love there King,
From whom there Honors all did Spring
Will you by Coxcombs be Commanded!
By Souters, Tailors, Cobblers, Curres,
Then quite your golden Swords and Spurre^
And take Some Trade to understand it.
12.
Base Gentry blushe, and hide your faces,
To serve such Clounes as keep you low,
And Squease your substance from you so
That they are Lords, you have but laces
Yet will you Suffer and sit still,
And give your monney with good will,
Who grudgd at subsidies before?
Packhorses who should pity you,
Since your Content your backs to bow
We vvishe your burdens may be more.
13.
Levites dare you lift up your hands
To beg a blessing on these men,
Whom their Dread Sovereigns blood does stayne,
And cries for Vengeance on the Land?
Are you Seduced all, and led
By your neew Mahomet that blade,
The Prophet Peter's, Hugh that cries?
A stubborn spirit rules in Him
When sack in spires him to the brim
His Lord and Master He denies.
14.
Preach woe and Judgment hanging ore
That cursed crew that killd their King,
And all those plagues that Heaven will bring
Upon those Murderers, thunder, roar.
Tell Traitor Fairfax to his face,
Though he have now laid down his Place
Yet from Gods hand He cannot flee,
And pray that they may never repent,
That did there Princes death consent
But that the innocent be free.
15.
Poor Poeple musled, and missled,
That must a monster now adore
Shake of thy yoke and groan no more
In slavery but set up thy head.
Call for your King, hang up those Knaves,
That suck your blood and make you slaves
There is no service to a King:
He is your Father and your Lord
Ordaind of God to swey the sword
His Reign shall blessings to you bring.
16.
Thou soldier that have sold thy soul
For Lawles liberty and gain
A Tyrant Monster to maintain
With many heads, most ougly foul,
Thy wickedness and woeful wroung
Shall find the just reward ere loung
When thou dismembered torn shall lie
And curse these Rogues that made thee rise,
Against thy King, before whose Eyes
Thou gaspes in gore but can not die.
17.
Up Scotland then thy Standards spread,
And follow forth / Lord of Hoasts,
Who Laughs at bragging Pharos boasts,
And through the seas his oune does lead,
His hand from heaven shall lead thee on
To tread thine enemies necks upon,
And ore their bellys Conquering go
Till Thou set Charles upon his Throne,
And see those Traitors every one
Hanged quartered, drawn, thy Zeall to show.
18.
And Thou o Lord! go still before.
Armd with Thy Thunders fire and flamme,
To put his ennemys to shame
That will not his just power a door,
Send Thy destroying Angel down
The Rebel camp in blood to droune,
But guard thine oune with Walls of fire
Shoot Lightnings in their faces Lord,
And strike them blind until the Sword
Have drunk their blood at full desire
19.
Go on Great King God Thee desend
And Croune thy head with Victory.
That all thine ennemys may see
Heavens blessing does thy arms attend.
May thy just Sword Sharp Vengeance take
Of those that Seek thy power to shake
And cut the cords of Conjuration,
And may Thy Scepter break and bruise
All that thy just Command refuse.
And thou be dear every Nation.
20.
Defend the Church she is Thy Mother
Her blessing shall upon Thee be,
Her Prayers have preserved Thee,
God hears Her Still above all other,
Let no proud Prelates creep within
Her gates, Strange guises te begin,
But have ore Such a Watchful Eye
These Wolves did Waste the Church of late
And troubled Sore both Church and State
The Load did heavy on Her lie.
21.
Maintain the Laws, and make more good,
Do Justice as becomes Thy place,
And be no niggard of thy Grace,
Nor Lavish of Thy subjects blood:
So shall Thy throne establishd be
In Righteousness and Equity
And Plenty shall heap up Thy store.
Thy Lands shall flourish, and Thy ships
Shall safly plough the Swelling deeps,
And fill with foreign good Thy shore.
22.
Brave Nobles that from ancient names
Draw your descent and, pedigree,
Whose worthy featts of Chevalrie
Left lasting Honors to these Times,
What fair occasion have you now
Your Loyal Courage for to show
In Service of your noble King?
Heavens never blessed a better cause
God calls you, and your duty draws,
Then bravely forth your banners bring,
23.
Stand up in arms all honnest Scots.
Revenge your King, His Crounes recover,
And Conquerours march all England over,
To sheath your Swords in Rebels throats.
Pull those usurping Traitors down
And hang them up, then burn there Town
That nothing may remain at all,
Then salt upon the ashes sow
That never grass again may grow,
Where London Stood nor yet Whitehall.
24.
Great King of Kings preserve our King
And guard Him with Thy Angels bright,
Cover His head when He Shall fight:
And to His breast a buckler bring:
Make all His ennemys sall back,
All Strength and Courage from them take
And let His Sword be drunk with blood,
That when Thy hand has Scattered them,
He may give glory to Thy Name,
And loung Reign, Happy, lust, and Good.
