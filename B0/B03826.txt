(...) pleasant Dialogue between the Countryman and Citizen, presented to my
Lord General and Council of State, at their last Dinner at Drapers Hall.
March the 28. 1660.
The tune is I Will never love thee more.


Tom. NOw would I give my life to see
this wondrous man of might.

Dick. Do see that jolly Lad? that is he,
I Will warrant him he is right.
There Is a true Trojan in his face,
observe him over and over.

Dick. Come Tom if ever George be base
(...) trust good fellow more.
He Is none of that Phantasti^^^e breed,
that murder while they pray,
That trusse and cheat us for our good,
(all in a Godly way)
He drinks no blood, and they no sack,
into their guts will pour,
But if George do not do the knack,
never trust, etc.
His quiet conscience needs to guard,
he is brave, but full of pity.

Tom. Yet by your leave I knocked so hard
h'ad like t'awak'd the ^^ty*

Dick. Fool it was the Rump that let a fart
the Chains and Gates it tore,
But if George bears not a true heart,
never trust etc.

Tom. Your City blades are cunning Rooks,
how rarely you collogue him,
But when your Gates flew off the Hooks,
you did as much be-rogue him,

Dick. Pugh -- it was the Rump did only (...)
the blows the City bore,
But if George be'nt as true as steel
never trust

Dick. Com by this hand we will crack a quart
thou'l pledge his health I trow,

Tom. Tope boy Dick -- a lusty vith my hear(...)
away w'^t Tom -- let it go.
Drench me you slave in a full Bowl,
I Will take it and twere a'score,

Dick. Nay if George be'nt a hearty soul
never trust, etc.

Tom. But hark you sirrah we are to loud,
he will hang us by and by,

D. Methinks he should be vengeance proud;
no more then thee or I.

Tom. Why then I Will give him the best blade
that ere the Bilbo wore,

Dick If George prove not a bonny Lad,
never trust etc.

Tom. it was well he came we'd quewl'd yt tale
-- we have all thrown up our Farms,
And from the Musket to the Flayle,
put all our men in arms.
The Girls had taken the Members down,
never saw such things before.

D. If George speak not the town our own*
never trust, etc.

Dick. But prithee are the folk so mad?


Tom. so mad say the're undone,
There^s not a penny to be had,
and every Mothers Son
Must fight if he intent to eat,
^

D. Come -- if George don't do the feat never trust etc.


Tom. Why Richard it is a divelish thing
we are not left worth a groat,
My Doll has sold her wedding Ring
and Su has pawn^d her Coat.
The sniv -- ling rogu^ abused our Squire,
and called our Mistress Whore,

D. Yet if George don't what we desire, never trust etc.

Tom. By this good day, I did but speak,
they took my Py-bal'd Mare,
And put the Carrion wench to, th squeak,
(things go against the Hairs)
Our prick-eard Cor'nell looks as big
still, as he did before.

Ric. And yet if George don't hum his Gig,
never trust, etc.
Faith Tom our case is much at one,
we are broke for want of Trade,
Our Cities baffled and undone,
betwixt the Rump and Blade,
We Have emptied both our veins and bags,
upon a Factious score,
If George compassion not our Rags
never trust, etc,

Tom. But what do think should be ye cause
whence all these mischiefs spring,

Ric. Our damned breach of Oaths and Laws,
our murder of the King.
We have bin slave since Charles his reign,
we lived like Lords before
If George don't set all right again,
never trust, etc.

Tom. our Vicar -- (and he is one that knows
told me once -- I know what,
And yet the Chief is woundy close,

Ric. It Is all the better, -- That.
His too much honesty and wit
to let his tongue run (...)
If ^his prove not a lucky hi^
nere trust etc.

Shal^s ask him what he means to do?

Tom. -- Good faith with all my heart,
^ou makst the better Leg of the two
take thou the better part.
(...) follow if thoult lead the Van,

Ric. Content -- I Will march before.
If George prove nor a valiant man
nere trust etc.

My Lord -- in us the Nation cra^es
but what your bound to d^^,

Tom. we have livd drudges, R. -- we ^av^


Ric. we would not die so too.
^estore us but our Laws again,
the unborn shall thee adore,
(...) George denies us his amen,
never trust Good Fellow more.
