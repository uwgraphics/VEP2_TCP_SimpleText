AN ADDRESS TO THE Lord Mayor, ALDERMEN, AND COMMON COUNSEL Of the Honorable
City of LONDON, And in particular to the Representatives thereof in the
Parliament now Assembled.

By Sir Francis Nethersole of Nethersole, in the County of Kent, Knight.

Except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it: Except
the Lord keep the City, the Watchman waketh but in vain,

My Lord, and Gentlemen.
Soon after the beginning of the late unnatural War between the King and his
Parliament, the issue whereof has proved destructive to them both, as I
foretold the one of them that it would prove, before they, or some of them had
destroyed the other; I was bold to dedicate certain considerations thereupon
to the then Lord Mayor, and Aldermen of the City, together with a project for a
Petition tending to a speedy accommodation of these unhappy differences, which
some wise men have thought might have been of as good use as any other of the
three then in agitation in the City; if it had found entertainment with them,
who then were in authority therein. And in the year, 1648. when the said War
was near to an end with us, and the then King and Parliament yet in being, I
presumed to address certain Problems to the then Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
Common Counsel, which I thought necessary to be determined by all, that either
had, or had not taken part on either side in the said War, for the making of
their peace with God, and the disposing of them to an hearty peace one with
another, which I hope was no evil design, though for good reason I disguised
my self in the making of that, as I had concealed my self in the former
address. I shall now with open face make a third Address to your Lordship,
the Aldermen, and Common Counsel, and in particular to the now chosen Members
of Parliament for the City, when I shall first have given your Lordship and
them a short account of my being as dis-interessed a person in the sad
divisions of the times as any other; which I cannot do more briefly, or more
fully any other way, then by referring you to the annexed relations of my
comportment in the late War toward both sides, written at the date of them
upon the occasion of my having then been a Petitioner to the Committee of
Coventry for liberty to have gone up to London, there to have compounded for a
part of the estate of a Nephew of mine, a little before slain on the Kings
side, to which I was his heir at Law, but could not then obtain that favor,
nor the year after neither, but upon the terms you may find in the addition
to what has passed between me, and the said Committee. By which relations,
your Lordship and the rest may see, what my opinion of the said War was from
the beginning to the end thereof, and that my behavior was ever conformable to
my opinion, the grounds whereof I have discovered in my said Problems. To which
relations I have but this to add, that in many extraordinary occasions I have
had since to examine my conscience, I never yet found cause to repent me either
of my opinion, or of my behavior in reference to the said War, and that my
daily private prayers have been, and to this day constantly are agreeable unto
them. In which among many other relating to this Church, and State, I do ever
make one Petition to this purpose, That God would be pleased to forgive all the
National and personal sins of the people of this Kingdom, but more
especially those sins (certainly known to his Divine Majesty only) for which
he did first dash the late King and his Parliament one against another, then
raised up weak means by his Almighty power to destroy them both, and for which
he has already sorely shaken, and now threatens utterly to ruin this Church
and State. And how near they now are to utter ruin by our divisions at home,
and War, and fear of more Wars from abroad; I would it were not too
visible to every one that has but half an eye. For the prevention whereof I
humbly beseech your Lordship and the rest to give me leave to propound these
few things to your mature consideration, and deliberate resolution.

First, because it is impossible that we should ever be brought to any good and
perfect agreement among our selves (which if we once were again, we need be in
no more fear of all the world besides then heretofore we were) until we have
all made our peace with God, whether it may not be fit for your Lordship and
the rest speedily to petition his Highness, and his Parliament (who this very
day are keeping a Fast in their respective Houses) to join together in the
proclaiming not of such a Fast as we have already kept too many, but such a one
as was proclaimed in Niniveh by the decree of the King, and his Nobles, and
observed by the people thereof, when perhaps that great City was not in
greater danger then yours now is. And that as a necessary preparative
thereunto, there may be a convenient number of godly, wise persons chosen, and
commissioned by them to make a prudent, and diligent inquiry after all the
most crying sins of this Kingdom, and those in special, which may have been
committed by the late King and his Parliaments, and for which it may most
probably be collected that God permitted the devil, and his instruments to
stir them up to the making of such a War one against another, as I think is
without president; till they were both destroyed: To which Commissioners, if by
them commanded, I shall by letter, (for I am now too old for travels) freely
declare the apprehensions which have been now a long time fixed in my
profoundest thoughts.

Secondly, whether it may not be, not only fit, but necessary for your
Lordship, and the rest in the same Petition: humbly to move the Lord Protector
and his Parliament, that by their Authority an Act may speedily be passed for
the re-assembling of all the Members of both Houses, who constantly adhered to
that Parliament of this Kingdom which was lately in War with their King,
and which certainly was intended by the contrivers, and authorizers of the
Solemn League and Covenant. For I humbly pray your Lordship and the rest, to
weigh the force of this Dilemma in the balance of your most serious thoughts;
That either that Parliament was dissolved by the late Kings death, or it was
not. If it were, then all the Acts and Ordinances of that piece of Parliament,
which called it self a Parliament, and continued to sit after that time are
Nullities, the many infallible consequences whereof I will not deduce. If it
were not, then though it have been discontinued now a great while, yet is it
not dissolved, this having been the peculiar right, and privilege of that
Parliament, that it could not be dissolved, prorogued, or adjourned but by Act
of Parliament, which right and privilege all that have entered into the said
Solemn League and Covenant are thereby obliged in their several Vocations to
endeavor mutually to preserve. And perhaps all you, my Lord and Gentlemen, I
am sure the generality of the City (not to mention thousands in the Country,
as well of the Kings Party as of the Parliaments) have sworn that Covenant
with hands lifted up to the most High God, who will not be mocked. And besides
this, how the ancient and undoubted Liberties, and privileges of Parliament,
which by the additional Petition and Advise the late Lord Protector, and all
his Successors was, and are bound to preserve (as I humbly conceive) and not
to suffer them to be broken or interrupted, can be preserved, and secured from
being broken and interrupted: Or how the Rights and Liberties of the people of
this Kingdom, which by the same additional advice every member of Parliament,
as a Member of Parliament, is by his Oath bound to endeavor to preserve, can
be preserved by any other means beside the recontinuing of that Parliament the
contriver or contrivers, and the givers of that Advice might possibly
comprehend, and so may the Members of the present Parliament (for so many
quick-sighted eyes may see much more then any one) but I will here freely
acknowledge, that it is beyond the reach of my understanding.

In the third place my humble request to your Lordship and the rest is, that
either by a Petition from your selves, in the name of the whole City to his
Highness the Lord Protector, or by a motion from those chosen by the City to
serve in this Parliament, or by both, as to your wisdoms it shall seem most
expedient, you would be pleased to move, that all Members of both Houses of
this, and of all future Parliaments may take that Oath, which with the Bill to
that purpose hereunto annexed, was by me drawn up in the third year of the
Reign of the late King, by the advice of the Lord Cook, and by me offered to
the then House of Commons, after I had therein made the speech hereunto annexed,
which I had before that showed by a friend to a Peer of this Kingdom, then,
and yet of greatest reputation for wisdom, and had his approbation thereof; Or
if that Oath shall be found either defective, or inconvenient in any respect,
then some other Oath of their own framing to the same purpose. The chief of the
Aldermen who served in that Parliament for the City (whose name I have now
forgotten) was pleased to second me very affectionatelie, when I brought in
that Bill, yet, by the occasion I have touched in the adjoined Advertisement,
after a second Reading it was so committed, that it has been a close prisoner
ever since. For though it were by me since put into the hands of a Member of
the House of Commons, soon after the opening of the late long Parliament, with
a desire to have had the Act first turned into an Ordinance, and then passed by
the Upper House unto the late King for his Royal Assent, which no doubt his
Majesty would most gladly, not only have given, but have taken the same Oath
himself, if that had been humbly desired of his Majesty, and that, by Gods
blessing, might have been a means to have prevented the great misunderstanding
between his Majesty and that Parliament at first, afterward set on fire, and
blown up into the flame of a most unnatural War by Jesuitical counsels, given
on both sides so craftily, that they who gave these councels were never
discovered on either side. For the men of that Sect have been long versed in
the trick, to set up a pack of Cards in such a manner, that all the Diamonds (I
mean Puritans) from the Ace to the Ten, shall by tales suggested to them, seem
to be they that throw down all the Coat Cards of that color, when in truth the
knave of Clubbs is the first mover of the Bunch. But that Member of the House
of Commons conspired with the formerly intimated, to keep the said Bill close
in his own hands, for ought I know, why he knows best. I have therefore now
set it at full liberty, and do hereby humbly recommend it not only to your
Lordship, and the rest of the Gentlemen to whom it is addressed, but under
their good favor, and with due submission to the consideration of all the
Members of both Houses of the present Parliament. From whom if it, with the
rest I have now taken the boldness to offer to you, my Lord, and Gentlemen,
shall be so happy as to pass to his Highness the Lord Protector, I can
therefore have no doubt of his Highness assent thereunto, because to the best
of my poor understanding, no humane means can tend more to the settling of his
Highness, and of this, and the neighbor Kingdoms too in a happy condition.
Wherein, after some months (I might say years) debate thereupon with my self,
and as long continued prayers to God night and day for the assistance of his
holy Spirit of wisdom, which he has promised to give to them that want and ask
it, I am grown so confident, that if I were as much and nearly interested in
his Highness prosperity, as his Consort and children are, and in the prosperity
of these Kingdoms as himself is, and had the honor to be as high a favorite
of his affairs, as Cardinal VVolfey sometime was to King Henry the eighth; I
would give his Highness the same council I have now presumed in all humility
to propound to your Lordship, and the rest, but with this caveat, that the
matter might be so managed by his wisdom, that it might be given to him by
others, and not be known to have been either given by me, or taken by himself.

Whereunto I have but this to add in the fourth and last place, that you my
Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Counsel, and by your persuasion, the whole
City would withal be pleased unanimously to resolve, and as unanimously to
declare your full resolution, to stand by his highness with your lives and
estates against all opposition whatsoever, if it may please his Highness to
re-continue the said long Parliament (which heretofore stood chiefly by your
support under God) according to the tenor of your Petition to his Highness,
or his Parliament, or rather to them both. And that your Lordship, and the
City, which pays most by much in all imposed taxes, would in that respect,
do your selves the honor, and right to be the first to move in the House of
Commons, that a sufficient supply may be by them presently granted and sent up
to the Other House, and without any delay tendered to his Highness for the
supply of the many great and urgent occasions of the State at home, and
abroad, till the already longest Parliament that ever met may be re-assembled,
and continued so much longer only, till now this extremely discomposed and
disordered Church and State, may be by them through Gods blessing reduced to
some good settlement upon righteous foundations (no other being durable) which
if I may live to see, I shall then joyfully sing my Nunc dimittis, this being
the seventie third Year of my age. The God and Lord of the Spirits of all flesh
put such thoughts and resolutions into the heart of your Lordship, and of all
those to whom these poor papers are addressed, and of all other into whose
hands they may come, as may tend most to the advancement of his own honor, and
of the weal of this Church and State, according to the prayer of

My Lord and Gentlemen, Your Lordships, and theirs, and the Cities most humble
servant. FRANCIS NETHERSOLE.
From my Cell at Polesworth in the County of Warwick, this 27. of Jan. 1658.
