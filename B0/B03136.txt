On the Death of the Reverend RICHARD LINGARD, D. D. Dean of Lismore, and
public Professor of Divinity in the University of Dublin.
ODE.
Immedicis brevis est aetas, and rara senectus, Quicquid amas, etc. Mart.
I Am convinced now that I was abused,
I thought it once a common place,
Rather a custom, than a grace,
And common as the Deaths for which 'twas used;
When Poets rather than their grief,
Imposed upon their own belief,
Telling the World that all things rare,
Were only symptoms of despair;
That to be early very great
Was life's perfection, and its date,
The only Crisis of approaching fate:
Methought they seemed as if they would
Persuade 'twas dangerous to be good,
That ripest Virtue which can only claim
With us an immortality, was Fame,
And merely mortal, set aside the Name.
That come unto its pitch, it did expire,
Because it never could get higher
And sooner fell, if it did soon acquire,
As if the swiftness made it out of breath,
And its perfection, not disease alone, but death.
II.
To prove this Fate, you will with an Emblem meet
Of Flowers that in strange perfumes smile,
And with realities beguile,
As sweet as short, but ah! as short as sweet;
Or else they will tell you that the day,
Which laughs in the most vigorous ray,
Cannot last, but ends the sooner for its flight,
And weeps its glories in swift night:
Such Similies as these, my dearest Friend,
May suit with Verse, but not thy end,
He must name nothing else, that would commend,
Pardon Gray Virtues, if I am so bold,
(And grief is so) to say that you are Old:
LINGARD was green, green as the World first was,
Born at full age, bearded with downy grass,
Yet he was ripe, yea full as ripe as they,
Who to his Cradles color live their way;
For he was born just as he dyed, all gray.
Now I Will believe the man that did implore
That, or his joys, or wishes might be lower,
Lest one excess the other should devour,
That wish, dear LINGARD, fitted us for thee,
For if ere man was loved to death, then thou art he.
III.
Thy day of life as yet shone in its prime,
Fresh in its morning it did play,
In the young manhood of its day,
And had a journey to the noon of time,
Never dreamt of shades, but briskly ran,
When Death that grand Eclipse began,
And interposed dull Earth by a sad slight,
Hiding thy beams, has lest poor us in night;
Our little world looks dark for want of thee,
And such another light it scarce will see,
Till the first last day of Eternity.
Cannot Death mistake? For sure it told
Thy aged parts, and therefore thought thee old.
Ah no! 'twas Heaven called for its own,
All thoughts of Age it lets alone,
Time's not regarded there, nor known:
But Thee it knew, and therefore did approve,
Yet with a due respect to those above,
Better than Us they may, more they cannot love.
Should it choose often so, mortals forgive,
If I affirm, 'twill soon become a shame to live.
IV.
Surely kind Heaven will thy great loss repair,
And in exchange send us one down
To bear the honors of the Gown,
The double charge of Pulpit, and of Chair,
When to the sacred Schools he came,
How did he check, and snuff the flame
Of those whose passion was their cause,
And thought Divinity applause;
I Have seen him when small things arose,
The empty stratagems oppose,
And cut the hairs, and shave 'um close:
He Would give them scope, a Sea he would let them have,
And talk in storms, and in huge tempests rave;
But if the furious waves touched Heaven, he would rise,
And like a Neptune, with his brow chastise,
And look all smooth, and fair as his own eyes:
He Would end those little wars with such success,
And with such satisfaction, one might guess,
The men themselves did know their own minds less;
Were we not sure Heaven no dispute can bear,
The Saints might choose him to the self same office there:
V.
But when he in the Pulpit did appear,
(The Pulpit now an empty place)
'Twas in such genuine Majestic grace;
As if some Angel moved in his own sphere;
He aimed not at that shallow happiness
Of owing matter to a formal dress,
To cheat men's judgments never was his care,
He slighted painted words, and carved air.
Things in his words, no Picture there appears,
Things from him came so naked to the ears.
As if his Organs were not his, but thiers;
Though much he spoke, yet all was short he said,
He spoke things almost just as they were made.
When he (as still he was at naming sin)
In what a holy passion has he been,
What ecstasies have Men and Angels seen?
To such a decent rage he would grow,
As if he knew not what he did; but so
He did it, as he always made us know:
Like healing spears his words against sin employed,
Did make Vice blush, and love to see it self destroyed.
VI.
He seemed to some that knew him, so inclined,
Or rather tied to virtue so,
That he was good even whe'r he would or no.
For virtue was the very soul of*s mind.
Severe he was to vice alone,
Yet scarce then was his rage his own,
So very mild his native mien,
And so extremely hard to wean,
That he, plain he, than whom was none,
Hypocrisy could more disown,
Was sorc'd to counterfeit a frown;
And this though just he was compelled to do,
First fell out with himself, and then with you.
But all this virtue's buried! can there be
A Grave, a Tomb for immortality?
If virtue e're was mortal, it was in Thee.
A Fever took him hence, a Fever came,
And snatched him hence, oh giv't a better name,
He could not burn but in some holy flame.
Call it a Chariot of fire,
He like a Prophet should retire,
And all the Universe must thus expire,
The Phoenix world like him one day,
Will in bright flames refine its clay,
And only purge the Accidents away;
For be it spoke with reverence to the skies,
Bate them, and as he fell, we may expect he will rise.
FINIS.
Oration Funebris habita in Aula Collegii Trinitatis juxta Dubl. Novem. die
decimo tertio, in Exequiis Viri vere Reverendi RICHARDI LINGARDI, S. T. D. and
Professoris Pub. necnon Decani Lismorensis.
INtuenti mihi, Auditores, circumfusam hanc Coronam, tot funesti and lugubres
undique Vultus occurrunt, adeo Omnia Squalore insolito obsita, it a mortua
plane visa sunt, ac si conventum hodiernum habuissemus, non tam ad Sepeliendum
Viri Clarissimi Cadaver, quam ad Repraesentandum: Statuarum more, ad illius
obrigentes Monumentum. Flevtmus nuper Nonnullorum Funera; at Lingardi
obslupescimus Fatum: scilicet si tota Academia unico ictu everteretur and in
Collegium Omnium Animarum Transmigraret, lugendum minus esset Iusortunium, and
licet ad tantum Funus celebrandum deesset forsitan Orator, minus certe quam
nunc desideraretur. Quod ad me attinet, de mortuo Lingardo loquuturus, ipsum
morientem refero, elangutscit Lingua, vox haeret faucibus, nil nisi triste
sonans and lethale: Sin attonitus minus extitissem Orator, ipsa tamen deessent
verba vel nostris doloribus, vel (quae unica majora sunt) illius meritis
partia: neque enim aequum est ut amplius eloquium expectaretis, dum in eternum
sileat Lingardus. Jacet ille inter Silentum claustro taciturnus, vocalis nuper
Mysta nec minus Oraculum, quique modo tonitru and fulgure missis de talo
vocibus, Numinis instar, eloquutus est; and tam caelesti igne vel intactis
corporibus liquefecit Animas, silens eheu! ipsus exanimisque jacet, Fulguris
inslar, ipsa in coruscatione evanescens.

Sed ut eruditius lugeamus, and ut grata Lingardi Manibus fieret Parentatio,
attentius paulo perpendamus, quot Vnico in Viro virtutes amisimus,quot Art^^^,
and Naturae dotes und cum illo interierunt, quae quanquam infinita poene sint
and majora quam comprehendi poterint, aliquale tamen pietatis erit Indicium
illorum vel aemulari Scientiam; idemque de Lingardi Perfectionibus dici potest,
quod de divinis solet, quarum cognitionem Omnes expetere debent, licet Nemo
unquam sit assequuturus.

Familia oriundus est antiqua satis, nec ignobili, licet nulla jactitet
Stemmata, vel dimidiatas Heroum Imagines, Protoplasto similis qui nullos
agnoverat Majores sibimet ipse Origo fuit, and Complementum: Minora Sidera suum
mutuantur Splendorem, Sol tantum nativa gloria elucescit, idemque saepe accidit
Viris illustrioribus, quod maximis Fluminibus, quorum Fontes saepenumero
ignorantur. Si doctrina vero faceret Heroas, a Patre Semone ortus est, Viro
usque adeo erudito ut (si quam Fame fidem adhibeamus) insigniois notae
Theologum posteriora haec Saecula non produxere, praeter unicum filium, adeo ut
crederemus illum extroduce Theologum, and nasci Professorem.

At quia Piaculum esset quicquam de Lingardo nisi magnum hariolari, aspiciamus
illum praeteritis puerilibus annis, grandiore jam aetate provectum, ab Academia
exornatum, illamque rursus exornatum, a Cantabrigia ingentes honores
referentem, quibus non minores retribuerat, ubi brevissimo temporis intervallo
profectu, tanto adolevit ut Scientias universas ita noverit, uti nemo paene
Singulas, utpote qui natura, and Artibus usus est similiter liberalibus
Dilectissimum hunc Alumnum diu amplectebatur Granta, sed Ignobilium and vulgi
Fatum est, nisi in Civitate sua ignorari, nec nascebatur Lingardus Ephemeridi
similis, in usum unius tantum Regionis. Huc igitur accersitur, Ac nescio sane
utrum majores hac Academia Grantae debentur Gratiae, quod nobis primum dederit
Collegium, vel quod tontum Virum accomodaverit. Ejus enim (...) open pristino
Splendori restituia est Academia, quae vel in Academia quaeteretur. Statuta,
mores, pietatem denique antiquam reddidit, noc tantum dissipavit nubes, verum
etiam Orbem Academicum illustravit. Piam etiam collocavit operam in Ecclesiam
purificando, Fanatici^ Sordibus inquinatam. Ingens vere opus! nec minus quam
Augaeum Stabulum purgasse, lustare Templa quae aliquando in Stabula conversa
sunt. Totos Schismaticorum Exercitus ipse solus stravisse poterat, diraque illa
Sectariorum capita, hydras renescentes contudisse, Romae cladem vel ad aras
juravit Sacer Hannibal, Alpesque Atramento penetrare potuit Aceto long
edaciore: adeo ut in illo tanta Romae and Genevae ignominia (...) Britanniae
gloria occubuerit.

Sic regnavit diu Doctrinae, Ingenii, and Virtutum Princeps, diu and adhuc sine
Rivali regnaturus, Insignesque hae Animi dotes tali comitate junctae sunt, ut
Charitate ejus mil unquam universum magis, praeter Eruditionem; neque enim opus
erat ut ad stabiliendum ejus Imperium, Sultanorum more, suos occideret Fratres.

Quanta perspicuitate retexit Scholasticorum telas? adeo ut Haereticus
unusquisque, Arachnes ad instar, propriis visceribus fatalia sibi fila traxisse
videretur; ac si Romani isti Pugiles, ut Romani Gladiatores, intrarent
Theatrum, tantum ut occiderentur. Coram ingenii illius luce evanuerunt tenuia
Barbarorum Sophismata, nec amplius subtiles audiunt, nec Angelici, nec
Irrefragabiles, Orecula ejus vel a Sera Posteritate memor abuntur, tanquam
Numinis verba (...) si cum ipsius Orbis interitu peritura; quique tot divina
pandit mysteria semper vigebit, efforebitque semper Scholae perpetuus Dictator.

Cum vero pro Rostris peroraret, quam sacro horrore perculit auditorum me^^^
Conciones illae suadentes gratiam. ipsius gratiae instar, placide quidem
traxerunt animum, sed irresistibiliter. Quam coelesti furore caelestia profudit
verbo? Mirabile certe est illum non zelo citius and pietate, quam febre
tabuisse. Occubuit vero tandem hostili morbo adortus, and propria Fortitudine
proditus, ipsius (...) Fortuna, quoe divisi Orbis and sui ipsius Viribus
labefacta est. Victor ^er omnes glorias, inter omnia Trophaea defunctus, vel
medio in triumpho cogitur sese mortalem meminisse. Sic virescunt flores donec
ad summam perveniunt pulchritudinem, and nimto calore exarescunt; media in
aetate mortuus Lunam refert, qu^ nunquam nisi cum plena sit, patitur Eclipsin.
Quid mirum jam si Ecclesia rueret cujus Basis facta est cinis, cujus Columna
Sepulchrum est? Quicunque transeatis in posterum Viatores ad illius tumulum,
sislite pedes, and cognoscite majus publici doloris nunquam extitisse
Monumentum quam Ligardi Cadaver: Discite in illius jacere Rogo sui Saeculi
delicias and miraculum; Theologorum doctissimum, Amicorum fidelissimum, in
quantum denique pateretur humana sors, Virum undequaque consummatum: nec
amplius miremini barbara barbarorum Monumenta, miraculorum nomine
cohonestantes, sub hoc quippe Marmore miracul^^^ sepelitur, id enim sonat
Lingardus, vigetque Fama aere Corinthiaco and Mausolae perenniore, Pyramide
Fama, cujus Basis terram aequat latitudine, Fastigium Calos sublimitate, Fama
quae semper ad sidera aspirabit, quaeque ipsi tempori coaevae, Pyramidis
instar, nullas unquam umbras admissura est.

FINIS.
