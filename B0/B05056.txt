The Royal Wanderer:
OR, Gods Providence evidently manifested, in the most mysterious Deliverance
of the Divine Majesty of CHARLES the Second, King of Great Britain.
Though bold Rebellion for a time look brave,
Man shall not slay what God resolves to save.
To the Tune of, The wandering Prince of Troy, or, Troy town.




When ravishing Rebellion reigns,
Then Loyalty is lead in chains,
The Royal Princes of the blood,
By Traitors are not understood,
but they could not his fate pull down,
that was preserved for Englands Crown.
Witness the heat at Worcester fight,
Which put our Royal King to flight,
When twice a stately horse was there,
Shot under him by chance of war.
^ut all that chance could not throw down
a Prince preserved for Englands Crown.
^et was he forced to quit the field,
^inces sometimes to slaves must yield:
(...) with some faithful Lords did fly,
(...) places for obscurity.
^^^d at a Farme-house there did he
^isrobe himself of Royalty.
(...) chain of Gold, whose good account
Did to three hundred pounds amount,
(...)ve a trusty servant, and
Discharged them all from his command.
then the Lord Wilmot with their knives
cut both their hair, to save their lives.
^hus with one friend faithful and good,
He wanders through an obscure wood:
Until a hollow Oak unknown
Was made the King of Englands Throne,
and all the succor that was brought,
was by this Loyal servant sought.
But Wilmot in his wanderings,
A Soldier met of the old Kings,
That knew him, and with true good will,
Secured him in a Malt-house Kill,
where he lay sweating, almost fier'd
till Soldiers came, searched, and retired.
'Twas nere the house of Mistress Lane,
Whose name let no wild tongue profane,
The Lord, with dangers much distressed,
Told how the poor King was oppressed,
to Mistress Lane, whose sighs and tears,
did show her sorrows, griefs, and fears.
She humbly does implore that he,
Would seek his sacred Majesty:
And bring him thither, that she might
Take speedy order for his flight.
brave Wilmot he with eyes nere shut,
till with much search he found him out.
Then from the hollow tree he brings
This heart of Oak, and best of Kings,
To Mistress Lanes, where after she,
Did kneel unto his Sovereignty:
They call a counsill how he should,
in safety pass the Ocean flood.
The second part
to the same Tune,




BRistol was thought the privat'st place,
Where shipping might attend his Grace,
And as her servant William he,
Must cloak it in her Livery.
likewise before her he must ride,
only her father in Law beside.
He was as weary of the Cloak,
As he was lately of the Oak:
But Master Lastell as most fit,
Uncloak'd the King and carried it.
no danger in the way they saw,
until they met her Brother in Law.
The Brother spied and quickly spoke,
Sir, why bear you your servants cloak?
But she made answer, it is so great
That it does thrust me from my seat.
her Brother (anwered thus by art)
they talk no more, shake hands and part.
But note a change of more renown,
As they were passing through a Town,
They met a Troop of horse which might
Have put them all into a fright.
but their good fate so gentle was
they through the Captains troop did pass.
When they came to their Inn at night,
The Cook-mayd gave the King delight,
She asked his birth, and whence he came?
A Naylors son in Brumageham
replied the King; prithee quoth she
my Jack is down, wind't up for me.
The King unused to deal in Iacks,
Winds up until the tackling cracks:
At which the wench (if all tales true be)
Rayl'd at the King, and called him booby.
the King went out and laughed, but they
next day to Bristol made their way.
At Bristol all their hopes were drowned,
For no convenient ship was found:
From Mistress Lane he parts, and goes
With trusty Wilmot amongst his foes.
to London and to Westminster,
in the Hall, where the Scotch Ensigns were
He wandered up and down the Town,
By some concealed, to most unknown:
It Was not a thousand pound could make
Them their fidelities forsake.
a ship is hired, the Master straight
begins to understand his freight.
Quoth he, what lading do you bring,
I surely know this is the King.
If I this strange adventure run.
I shall be utterly undone.
but with his heart they did prevail,
and valiantly he hoysts up sail.
Quoth he, if I on T^burn swing,
It Is for the safety of a King:
And if he ever crowned be,
He surely will remember me.
the winds blew fair, Aver de grace
in France became their landing place.
He rides to Roan, and writes from thence
To Paris, of Gods Providence.
The Duke of Orleance did come
With friends, to bid him welcome home.
and now in London it is well known
he was preserved for Englands Throne.
