The CASE of the Clothiers and Fullers of the Counties of Gloucester, Devon,
Oxford, Worcester, York, Dorset and Wiltshire.
THE East India Company have for several Years last past Bought about 10000
Clothes per Annum, which are fully Manufactured, and do amount to upwards of
100,000 l. per Annum, in which same Manufacture upwards of 40000 Families are
Annually Employed.

The said Company (besides Great Quantities of Norwich-Stuffs, Callimancoes.
Camblets, etc.) have also Bought for several Years last past, upwards of 8000
Exeter Long Else per Annum; which are likewise fully Manufactured here, and do
amount together to upwards of 20000 l. per Annum; which Manufacture does, in
like manner, Annually Employ many Thousands of Poor Families.

The said Clothiers and Fullers being Informed, a Vote is past the Honorable
Committee, for Ways and Means for Laying a farther Duty on the East India
Trade, which if it should pass into a Law, they have great Reason to believe it
will be so great a Discouragement to the said Trade, as to disable the said
Company from Buying and Exporting the said Manufactures; which in Consequence
will be the Ruin of many Thousands of Poor Families, and will considerably
Lessen the Price of Wool.

They therefore do most humbly Pray, the said Duty may not be Laid.

THE CASE OF THE Clothiers and Fullers, OF THE Counties of Gloucester, Devon,
Oxford, Worcester, York, Dorset and Wiltshire.
