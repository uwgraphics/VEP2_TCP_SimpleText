The Troubles of these Times OR,
The Calamities of our English Nation,
Makes many a heart sore fad, and out of Fashion,
Which is a trouble and grief to all,
There Is many a man in danger for to fall,
But it is our Sins that causes this to be,
That brings this Trouble, and this Misery,
Lets pray to the Lord, our Nation to defend,
And all English people Strive their lives to mend,
And not to take so much the Lords Name in Vain,
We must look for Judgments for the very same.
To the Tune of, A Lesson for all true Christians.






POor England now is full of Care and Grief,
To see the Wars amongst us for to be so brief;
It makes all People they know not what to do,
They are so full of care the truth is so.
Trading is down, there is little to be got,
The poorer sort they are very hard put to it,
To maintain their Charge and children in their need,
To see them want will make their hearts to bleed.
There Is many plaints, there is little for to do,
They walk up and down, so heavily they go,
They know not what to think, or how to tell,
But it is the Lord that can make all be well.
Let us pray to the Lord then with a tender heart,
There is nothing better that can take our part;
It Is not the Arm of flesh can do us wrong,
If the Lord be with us, who can hurt us than.
But the pride o'th Nation has been very sore,
Now we must suffer for it to be sure;
The poorer sort of People abides the smart,
But a true Believer in God is the best part.
It Is not the strength of Armed Men besure,
That can relieve us, or make us secure,
It Is the Lord from Heaven that must be our friend,
To bring Peace and quietness in England again.
And we our selves be in mighty care,
To live uprightly, and the Lord to fear;
The Sins o'th Nation to the Lord does cry,
Makes all these Troubles on this Land to lie.
Therefore we had need to pray then Night and Day,
To defend us from the Sword then every way;
The War and Sword brings Famine at the length,
If it hold long in bloody force and strength.
We know not what this may come to at last,
Or how this trouble will be over-past,
But the Lord above, He Is in Heaven still,
Let all be done unto His Blessed Will.
For if these troubles do continue Long,
There Is many Thousand will be clear undone;
But the Lord he does know best then what to do,
If we can be careful our sins for to forgo.
We desire that love amongst us may increase,
And grant our Nation a true happy Peace,
What a comfort that would be, if the Lord be pleased,
That of this War our Nation could be eased.
If it hold long, we shall be all undone,
We need to pray then every Mothers Son,
That the Lord of Heaven may of us take a care,
To forgive us our Sins, and put us out of fear.
When great Afflictions comes upon our Land,
That the Lord is pleased amongst us for to send,
We may thank our selves; our Wickedness is great,
Our Sins lies heavy, and I Am sorry fort.
Now to conclude, we have no more to say,
That we may serve the Lord, and Him Obey,
And bless our English Nation evermore,
And take off these troubles, which grieves our Nation sore,
That we may live in happiness again,
And let all good Christian people say, Amen.
FINIS.
