AN ORDINANCE OF BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, For the suppressing of Public
Stage Plays throughout the Kingdom, during these Calamitous Times.
WHereas the distressed Estate of Ireland, steeped in her own Blood, and the
distracted Estate of England, threatened with a Cloud of Blood, by a Civil
War; call for all possible means to appease and avert the Wrath of God
appearing in these Judgments: Amongst which, Fasting and Prayer having bin
often tried to be very effectual, have bin lately, and are still enjoined: And
whereas public Sports do not well agree with public Calamities, nor public
Stage Plays with the Seasons of Humiliation, this being an Exercise of sad and
pious Solemnity, and the other being Spectacles of Pleasure, too commonly
expressing lacivious Mirth and levitie: It is therefore thought fit, and
Ordained by the Lords and Commons in this Parliament Assembled, that while
these sad Causes and set times of Humiliation do continue, public
Stage Plays shall cease, and be forborne. Instead of which, are recommended
to the people of this Land, the profitable and seasonable Considerations of
Repentance, Reconciliation, and peace with God, which probably may produce
outward peace and prosperity, and bring again Times of Joy and Gladness to
these Nations.

Die Veneris, September. the 2. 1642.
ORdered by the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, that this Ordinance
concerning Stage Plays be forthwith Printed and Published.
