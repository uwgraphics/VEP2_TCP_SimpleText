The VIRGIN's COMPLAINT AGAINST Young MEN'S Unkindness.
Of young Men's falsehood she does much complain,
Resolving never to love Man again:
Experience tells her Men love but for fashion,
That makes her rail against them in such passion.
To the Tune of, Cupid's Courtesy, etc.

I Am so deep in love,
I cannot hide it,
It breaks me of my rest,
and of my quiet;
For when I see his face,
it so inflames me,
That I must love him still,
though the world blame me.
O fie upon this love,
it will undo me,
I Will never love man again,
should the Gods woo me;
For if once I can
shake off this passion,
I Will never love man again,
but only for fashion.
There Is no believe in man,
though they seem civil,
For when they ^it like saints,
they think most evil;
Therefore be ruled by me,
never trust no man,
But if you needs must love,
pray love a woman.
I wish blind Cupid had
been soundly sleeping.
When like a crafty lad
he came so creeping,
To wound my tender heart,
and pierce my marrow,
I felt his fatal dart,
to my great sorrow.
Never poor virgin was
in such a taking,
I often looked in my glass,
pleasure forsaking;
My cheeks were pale and wan,
my lips did trimble,
Because I loved a man
that did dissemble.

O what a simple girl
I was for certain,
For to love Lord or Earl,
I will not hearken;
Not one in twenty score
but is deceitful,
Therefore I Will love no more,
men are deceitful.
It is their constant trade
to cog and flatter,
Or to delude a maid,
her fort to batter;
But if they prate and lie,
I Will not believe them,
Such love I Will never try,
although it grieve them.
They Will profess and pretend
much of affection,
Until they make you bend
to love's subj^ction:
Of your hearts craftily
they will bereave you,
Till a new face they spy,
then they will leave you.
Their words are all but wind,
like winter weather,
Unconstant and unkind,
light as a feather:
I tell you flat and plain
I Will not abide it,
To love a man again,
once having tried it.
Blame me not though I be
something in passion,
For now I plainly see
it is the fashion;
For such false-hearted men
are grown so common,
That when I love again,
I Will love a woman.
Why should a woman dote
on such a bubble,
That Is good for nothing but
to procure trouble?
Every day I will pray
for to live single,
That my affection may
with no man's mingle.
Ladies take my advice,
you have rare features,
Always be coy and nice
to such false creatures;
No man will constant prove,
no not my brother;
Then if you needs must love,
love one another.
