An Excellent Ballad, entitled, The Constancy of Susanna.
To an excellent New tune.


THere was a man in Babylon,
of reputation great by fame,
He took to wife a fair woman
Susanna was she called by name:
A woman fair and virtuous,
Lady, Lady,
Why should not we of her learn thus,
to live godly.
Virtuously her life she led,
she feared God, she stood in awe,
As in the story you may read,
was well brought up in Moses law.
Her parents they were godly folk,
Lady, Lady,
Why should we not then talk
of this Lady.
That year two Judges there was made
which were the Elders of Babylon,
To Ioachims house was all their trade,
who was Susanna's husband then:
Ioachim was a great rich man,
Lady, Lady,
These Elders often to his house came,
for this Lady.
Ioachim had an Orchard by,
fast joining to his house or place,
Whereas Susanna commonly,
her self did daily their solace:
And that these Elders soon espied,
Lady, Lady,
And privately themselves did hide
for that Lady.
Her chaste and constant life was tried,
by these Elders of Babylon,
A time convenient they espied,
to have this Lady all alone.
In this Orchard it came to pass,
Lady, Lady,
Where she alone her self did wash
her fair body.
The Elders came to her anon,
and thus they said fair Dame good speed
The doors are fast the Maids are gone,
consent to us and do this deed,
For we are men of no mistrust:
Lady Lady,
And yet to thee we have a lust,
O fair Lady.
If that to us thou do say nay,
a testimonial we will bring,
We will say that one with thee lay,
how can thou then avoid this thing
Therefore consent and to me turn,
Lady Lady,
For we to thee in lust do burn,
O fair Lady.
Then did she sigh and said alas,
now woe is me on every side;
Was ever wretch in such a case?
shall I consent and do this deed,
Whether I do or do it not,
Lady Lady,
It is my Death right well I wot,
O true Lady.
Better it were for me to fall
into your hands and be guiltless,
Then that I should consent at all,
to this your shameful wickedness?
And even with that (whereas she stood)
Lady Lady,
Unto the Lord she cried aloud,
pitifully.


THese Elders both likewise again,
against Susanna aloud they cried
Their filthy lust could not obtain,
their wickedness they sought to hide,
Unto her friends they then her brought
Lady Lady,
And with all speed the life was sought
of that Lady.
On the morrow she was brought forth,
before the people for to stand,
that they might hear and know the truth,
how these two Elders Susanna found,
The Elders swore and thus did say,
Lady Lady,
How that they saw a youngman lay
with this Lady.
Judgment there was for one offense,
Susanna causeless she must Die,
These Elders bore such evidence,
against her they did verify,
Who were believed then indeed,
Lady Lady,
Against Susanna to proceed,
that she should Die.
Susanna's friends that stood her by,
they did lament and were full woe,
When as they saw no remedy,
but that to Death she then must go.
Then unto him that is so just,
Lady Lady,
In God was all her hope and trust,
to him they cry.
The Lord her voice heard and beheld
the Daughters cry of Israel;
His Spirit he raised in a child,
whose name was called young Daniel,
Who cried aloud whereas he stood,
Lady Lady,
I am clear of the guiltless blood,
of this Lady.
Are you such fools (quoth Daniel then)
in Judgment you have not done well,
Nor yet the right way have you gone
to judge the Daughter of Israel,
By this witness of false Disdain,
Lady Lady,
Wherefore to judgment turn again
for that Lady.
And when to Judgment they were set
he called for these wicked men,
And soon he did them separate,
putting the one from the other then:
He asked the first where he did see
that fair Lady,
He said under a Mulberry tree,
who lied falsely.
Thou lie (said Daniel) on thy head,
thy sentence is before the Lord,
He bad that forth he might be led,
and bring the other that bare record,
To see how they two did agree
Lady, Lady,
He said under a Pomgranate tree,
who lied falsely.
Said Daniel as he did before,
behold the Messenger of the Lord,
Stands waiting for you at the Door,
even to cut thee with a Sword:
And even with that the multitude
aloud did cry,
Give thanks to God, and so conclude,
for this Lady.
They dealt like with these wicked men
according as the Scripture says,
They did as with their Neighbor then,
by Moses Law were put to Death:
She innocent preserved was,
Lady, Lady,
As God by Daniel brought to pass,
for this Lady.
