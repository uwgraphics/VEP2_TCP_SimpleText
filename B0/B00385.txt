The Constant Lover. Who his affection will not move,
Though he live not where he love.

To a Northern tune called, Shall the absence of my Mistress.




YOu loyal Lovers that are distant,
from your Sweet-hearts many a mile,
Pray come help me at this instant,
in mirth to spend away the while,
In singing sweetly and compleately,
in commendation of my love,
Resolving ever to part never,
though I live not where I love.
My love she is fair and also virtuous,
God grant to me she may prove true,
Then there is naught but death shall part us,
and I Will never change her for a new,
And though the fates my fortunes hates,
and me from here do far remove,
Yet I do vow still to be true,
though etc.
My constancy shall never be failing,
whatsoever betide me here,
Of her virtue I Will be telling,
be my biding far or near,
And though blind fortune prove uncertain,
from her presence me to remove,
Yet I Will be constant every instant,
though etc.
Though our bodies thus are parted,
and asunder many a mile,
Yet I vow to be true hearted,
and be faithful all the while;
Though with mine eye I cannot spy,
for distance great my dearest Love,
My heart is with her altogether,
though etc.
When I sleep I do dream on her,
when I wake I take no rest,
But every moment think upon her,
she is so fixed in my breast,
And though far distance may be assistance,
from my mind her love to move,
Yet I will never our love disseuer,
though etc.
To think upon the amarous glances,
that have been betwixt us twain,
My constancy and love aduances,
though from her presence I remain,
And makes the fears with groans and fears,
from watery eyes and heart to move,
And sighing say both night and day,
alas I live etc.
The second part,
to the same Tune*




I To her will be like Leander,
if Hero like she will prove to me,
For her sake through the world I Will wander,
no desperate danger I will flee,
And into the Seas with little ease,
the mountains great themselves shall move,
Ere faith I break, let me never speak,
though etc.
Penelope shall be unconstant,
and Diana prove unchaste,
Venus to Vulcan shall be constant,
and Mars far from her shall be placed,
The blinded boy no more shall joy,
with Arrows keen lovers to move,
Ere false I be sweetheart to thee,
though etc.
The Birds shall leave their Airy region,
the fishes in the air shall fly,
All the world shall be at one religion,
all living things shall cease to dye,
Al things shall change to shapes most strange,
before that I disloyal prove,
Or any way my love decay,
though etc.
If you lines do come before her,
or do deigne to touch her hand,
Tell her that I do adore her,
above all Maidens in the land,
Remaining still at her good will,
and always to her loyal prove,
Tell death with dart do strike my heart,
though etc.
And tell my mistress that a Lover,
that loves perfect image bears,
As true as love it self do love her,
witness his far fetched sighs and fears,
Which forth he groans with bitter moa^^s,
and from his troubled breast he moves*
And day nor night takes no delight,
because etc.
So with my duty to her commended,
her loyal servant I Will be still,
Desiring I may be befriended,
with love again for my good will,
And wish that she as true may be,
as I to her will constant prove,
And night and day I still will pray,
and wish I may live where I love
