By the King.
His MAJESTY'S Gracious Proclamation to the Cities of London and Westminster.

WHereas amongst other Arts used by the Promoters of this horrid and desperate
Rebellion against Us, great Industry and Subtilty has been applied to corrupt
Our Subjects of Our Cities of London and Westminster, First by engaging them in
Factions and Tumults, to aw the Members of both Our Houses of Parliament who
would not consent to their seditious Designs; Then by persuading them to Loans
and Contributions for the maintenance of the Army now in Rebellion against Us,
upon pretense that the same was raised for the defense of Our Person, The
Protestant Religion, The Laws of the Land, and Privilege of Parliament
(Whereas in truth it is for the destruction of them all) by their yielding
obedience to, and executing the pretended Ordinance of the Militia: And lastly,
by infusing into them a desperate sense of their own Condition, and that We are
so much incensed against them for the Premises, that We intend to plunder, and
give up the Wealth of those Our Cities as a prey to Our Soldiers; We do hereby
declare, That We are yet far from being so much incensed against those Our
Cities as these men desire to be believed, and in truth have endeavored to
make Us; but We believe that those Tumults were contrived by the Persons whom
We have formerly accused of that practice, and raised out of the meanest and
poorest People of those Our Cities and Suburbs, without the privity and consent
of the best and substantial Citizens and Inhabitants, and that the Loans and
Contributions which have been since raised, (though they have passed more
generally then We expected from the duty and sobriety of men of Fortunes and
understanding) have been wrested and extorted from them by Threats and Menaces,
and fear of plundering and violence. And therefore We do hereby offer Our free
and gracious Pardon to all the Citizens and Inhabitants of Our said Cities of
London and Westminster for all offenses concerning the Premises committed
against Us before the publishing of this Our Proclamation, (except all those
Persons whom We have excepted in Our Declaration of the twelfth of August, and
except Alderman Fulke, and Captain Manwaring, against all which We shall
proceed according to the rules of Law, as against Traitors and stirrers of
Sedition against Us) and We do assure them in the word of a King, that no
violence shall be offered by Our Army, or any part of it to any of them, not
doubting but their demeanor will henceforward be such, that We shall not
compelled to bring Our Army against them.

Provided that this Our Grace shall not extend to any Person, who after the
publishing this Our Proclamation shall presume by Loan or Contribution to
assist the said Army of Rebels, to assemble and muster themselves in Arms
without Authority derived from Us under Our hand, or to enter into any Oath of
Association for the Assistance of the Earl of Essex, how speciously soever the
same be pretended for Our safety: for since the encounter on Sunday the 23th.
of this Month, where they used all possible means and malice to have destroyed
Us, and where it pleased God to give Us so great a victroy over them (though
with the loss of many worthy men) no man can be unsatisfied in the mischief
and malice of their Rebelli^n And therefore We must, and do declare, That
whosoever shall henceforward by Money, Plate, or otherwise assist the said
Rebellion, shall take Arms by virtue of any pretended Ordinance, or shall enter
into any Oath of Association against Us, or without Our Consent, shall be
esteemed by Us as an enemy to the public Peace, a person disaffected to Us,
the Religion and Law of the Kingdom, and shall accordingly receive condign
punishment; of which We give them timely notice, that they may proceed
accordingly at their perils. And to the end that they may receive all possible
and particular assurance from Us of Our gracious Intentions toward them, We
shall be willing that such a number of grave and substantial Citizens be
employed from Our said City to Us, as shall by them be thought fit, who may
propose such things to Us on their behalf as shall be desired, to which we
shall give a gracious and just Answer. And we do assure them and all the world,
that as the Scandalls and Imputations upon Us concerning Our favoring of
Papists have been groundless, and maliciously contrived by the Authors of
this Rebellion to beget a misunderstanding between Us and Our Subjects, so all
the professions We have made in Our several Declarations for the suppression
of Popery, and the maintenance of the true reformed Protestant Religion
established in the Church of England, and for the defense of the Laws of the
Land, and the just Privileges of Parliament, shall be as inviolably observed
by Us, as We expect blessing from the Almighty God, and obedience from our
Subjects.

Given at Our Court at Ayno this 27. of October in the eighteenth year of Our
Reign.
God save the King.

MAJESTY: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
