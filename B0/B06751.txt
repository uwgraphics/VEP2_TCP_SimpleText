The Maidens sad Complaint for want of a Husband
Wherein she briefly does declare,
The want of a Mate makes her despair:
She has her portion all in Household goods
Yet none of those that wear scarfs and Hoods.
For she commends her self to any man,
That will but please her all the best he can.
To the new Westcountry Tune: Or Hogh when shall I be married?
by L. W.




O When shall I be married,
ho^gh be married?
My beauty begins to decay:
It Is time to find out somebody,
hogh some body,
Before it is quite gone away.
My Father has forty good shillings,
hogh good shillings.
And never a daughter but I:
My mother is also willing,
hogh so willing
That I shall have all if she dye,
I have gotten some money about me
hogh about me
For to help me in time of need:
Five shillings pray do not flout, me
hogh not flout me
For I will be married with speed.
My Father did give me a dish,
hogh and a spoon.
And a Table made of an old board:
Some young men will for me with stord,
hogh will wish
When they hear how bravely I Am




My Mother she gave me a Ladle
hogh a Ladle
And that for the present lies by,
My aunt she has promis^ a cradle
hogh a cradle
When any man with me does ly.
A pipain my Uncle he gave me
hogh he gave me
And milk porrage in it to make:
And Il let them burn too so bravely,
hogh so bravely
To show that a flut I do hate.
I have got two sp^ns and a trencher,
hogh a trencher
With por^^^ (...) made of clay:
Some squires (...) is a wencher,
hough a wencher
I wish he would fetch me away.
I have got a soft bed to ly on
hough to ly on
With fearchers an all long I say
But the most of all my sorrow
hough my sorrow
Is for want of Batchellors play.
Fine piggins and noggins my cozen
hogh my cozen
Has gave me that are so good:
With taps and ^^^^ets a dozen
hogh a dozen
And a chamber pot made of wood.
Thus young men I have declared
hogh declared
My household stuff which do ly by:
These seven years I have despaired
hogh despaired
For fear I a maiden should die.
If any young man will have me
hough will have me
And no other maiden esteem
I will maintain him bravely
hogh so bravely
And feast him with curds and cream.
For I Am a girl that is willing
hogh is willing
To (...) my maiden name:
So with me he will be billing
hogh he billing
I don't care from whence he came.
Then Thomas, Robbin or Willy,
hogh or Willy
Come any that is a man:
Let be Ralph, or Jarvis silly
hogh wise or silly
Come love me as well as you can.
If any one will me marry,
hogh me marry
I Will love him wondrous well:
For if longer I should tarry,
hogh should tarry
I fear I should lead Apes in tell
