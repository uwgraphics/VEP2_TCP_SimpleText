A pleasant new Ballad of Tobias, wherein is showed the wonderful things that
chanced unto him in his youth, and how he wedded a young Damsel that had had
seven husbands, and, never enjoyed their company, who were all slain by a
wicked Spirit.
To a new tune




IN Ninivy old Toby dwelt,
an Aged man and blind was he,
And much afflictions he had felt,
which brougth him unto poverty:
He had by Anna his true Wife,
one only Son and eke no more,
Which was the comfo^t of his life,
and he by him did set great store.
(...) ^^ought him up most virtuously,
(...) ^rue obedience and in aw,
(...) ^very day he did apply
(...) fear the Lord and keep his Law.
Upon a time it came to pass,
he called his Son to him with speed.
And thus to him these words did frame,
my son quoth he thou know my need
Thou must unto Gabael go,
to Raguels house in Media Land,
For I did lend him long ago,
ten Talents on his only Band.
My father dear Tobias said,
at your command straight will I go.
How shall I get the money paid,
seeing the man I nere did know.
Take here the Writings then quoth he,
which is sufficient being seen,
And get a guide to go with thee,
since thou the way have never been.
A guide Tobias soon had got,
An Angel in the shape of man.
Which thing he did not know God Wot,
the Lord did so appoint it than.
Tobias with his blessed guide,
went on his journey then with speed,
Until they came to Tygris side,
At the fair flood they did abide:
Tobias would go with him ^^er^
by reason of the Summers heat,
A mighty fish put him in fear,
which leapt out of the waters great,
Cut up the fish the Angel said,
and keep the Liver heart and gall,
To do the same be not afraid,
great cures there shall be done withal:
When this was done away they went,
and coming near their journy's end,
We Will lodge to night the Angel said,
with Raguel thy fathers friend.
He has a Daughter fair of face,
and also of a virtuous life,
And when we come unto that place,
I Will speak that she may be thy wife,
Why Azarius then quoth he,
for so they did the Angel call,
I wis she is no Wife for me,
swift death does all her Lovers fall.
Seven men to her have married been,
which in her love did take delight:
When her bed chamber they had seen,
they have not lived half the night,
A Wicked Spirit loves her so,
he will not suffer any man,
With her into the bed to go,
but works his death do what he can!
The Angel said good courage take,
for so it shall not be with thee,
For such perfumes I will thee make,
the Wicked Spirit away shall flee,
To Raguels home away they run,
where Sara met them fair and bright,
And after Salutations done
she brought them to her parents sight.




GReat cheer they made and down they sat)
and al for young Tobias sake
And after long and pleasant chat,
betwixt these two a match they make.
By Moses Law they married were,
the bride bed chamber prepared likewise
When young Tobias came in there.
the tears fell down from Sara's eyes.
A pan of coals he brought with him,
the fishes heart and liver there,
Within the fire he did cast in,
which cast a savor every where,
And by that sweet and precious smell,
the Wicked Spirit was displac't,
Within that room he could not dwell,
Where out away he went in have,
In bed they laid this beautions bride,
the chamber door they shut therefore,
Young Toby lay down by her side,
whom he did think to see no more,
And therefore Raguel in the night,
for him before had made a grave,
And to his Wife he wept and said,
there is no means his life to save,
One of the Maidens send quoth be.
to see how all the matter stands
And if it be so that dead he be,
he shall be buried by my hands.
This maiden joyful news did bring,
Tobias is alive quoth she.
When Raguel heard then of this thing,
he did rejoice exceedingly,
For joy he made a solemn feast
the bridal fourteen days he kept,
There to came many a friendly guest,
in sorrow now no more they slept.
Azarias went streightway,
unto the feast Gabriel brought,
Rejoicing at his marriage day,
did pay the money that he ought,
But yet old Toby and his Wife
did all the time in so^^ow dwell,
They thought their Son had lost his life,
and nothing could their grief expel.
His Aged mother every day.
did watch the Highway side,
And for his Welfare often did pray,
no meat nor drink she could abide,
But when the Wedding ended was,
young Toby with his lovely Bride.
To Ninivie did homewards pass.
with goods and Cattle on each side,
But Toby and the Angel bright
before his Wife made have to go,
For to prepare all things arright,
his lovely bride to welcome ho,
His mother watching in the Way,
full soon espied her tender son,
Rejoicing at that happy day.
she told her husband he was come,
Whereat old Toby stumbled out,
for he was blind and could not see,
Young Toby with the fishes gall,
rubbed both his eyes immediately.
Whereat the Whiteness of his eye,
incontinent did fall out quite,
So that before he did arise,
he had again his perfect sight.
Great joy there was on every side,
young Toby told his father all,
Who went to meet his lovely bride,
With joy and mirth that was not small
