Celindas last Gasp: OR, Her Farewell to False Coridon.
Since Coridon proved false in heart,
Celinda Mourned sore,
But feeling too too great a smart,
she vowed to Love no more:
But at the last all Conquering Death
did ease her troubled mind,
And as she parted with her Breath,
he staid not long behind.
To the Tune of, Young Ph^eon, Busy Fame: Or, Cloris fult of Harmless thoughts.




ATtend true Lovers and give ear,
unto my Dying Song,
For unto you I will declare,
how Cupid did me wrong:
For with his powerful cruel Dart,
he sought my grief and woe,
And pierced my tender Lovesick heart,
which proves my overthrow.
And Coridon who I did love,
beyond all other men,
To his Celinda false did prove,
which cut my heart again:
So now I to the Grave am brought,
for loving too too well,
Love would have brought, a heaven I thought,
but now it Proves a Hell.
Ah! fate to me so cruel still,
now let me know the cause,
That you this seek my Blood to spill,
for keeping Cupids Laws:
Them in my mind I thought I was
obliged to obey,
But now too late I find alas,
my comforts all decay.




When poor Celinda's dead and gone,
and laid within her Brave,
Write some Love Verses on my Touch,
it is all I now do crave:
But yet I fear no Shepherdess,
e're felt so deep a Wound,
My griefs and sorrows to express,
there is none that can be found.
Who can relate my riged fate,
and not be drowned in Tears?
Or who can pity my sad state,
that have for Months and years
Been Languishing in this Abiss,
and can no bottom find;
Robbed of all joy and true Loves Bliss,
and troubled in my mind.
And Coridon for thy hard heart,
thou shall tormented be,
For causing all this grief and smart,
which happened unto me:
For in the dead time of the night,
while others take their rest,
With Visions strange I Will thee affright,
and prove a breadful Guest.
Oh then too late thou shall repent,
that thou were so unkind,
'Twill be in vain for to lament,
that thou shall surely find:
Where ever thou shall be alone,
i will still be in thy sight,
I Will make thee sigh, and grieve, and mourn,
and rob thee of Delight.
That thou may be a warning to
such as like thee would prove,
And seek more Maidens to undo,
wrapped up in bonds of Love:
Who cannot find one hours content,
but burn with endless fire,
And do both night end day lament,
wanting their hearts desire.
So farewell cruel Coridon,
i will never love thee more,
Thou once were he I doted on,
and did too much adore:
One minute I out of my mind,
could not my Shepherd keep,
But he was Cruel and unkind,
and laughed to see me weep.
My sorrows now will have an end,
that I continued in,
And loosing his (once) faithful friend,
his Torments will begin:
True lovers all observe his fall,
of falsehood still beware,
For punishment is due to all,
that lay for Maids a share.
And thus the poor Celinda Died,
with a sad troubled breast,
And Coridon was terrified,
as is before expressed:
But let no lovers after this,
be faithless and unkind,
For when the Shepherd did see this,
he staid not long behind.
