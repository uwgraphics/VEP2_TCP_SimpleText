The Knitters Jobb
Or the earnest Suitor of WALTON Town to a fair MAID, With her modest Answers
and Conclusion of their intents

To the Tune of Shackley hey.




Within the Town of Walton fair
a Lovely Las did dwell
Both Carding, Spinning, Knitting yarn
she could do all full well:
This maid she many Suitors had
some were good and some were bad
Fa la la la la la la.
Above the rest one there hard by
did bear her such good will
That when he feared to be denied
himself they thought he would kill:
She took no notice of his grief
he daily went without relief
Fa la la la la la la.
She always shunned his company
and from him turned away
This young man knew not what to do
nor what to her to say:
His heart it was full sore oppressed
that night nor day he could take rest
Fa la la la la.
At length an opportunity
was offered unto him
To break his mind unto his Love
he made bold to begin
god Cupids aid he then required
all things might he as he desired*
Fa la la etc.
Quoth he my dear and only joy
I must impart my mind
Thou art the treasure of my heart
to me be not unkind:
If thou will yield to me thy Love
I ever constant still will prove
Fa la la la la etc.
Thou art so rarely qualified
so Lovely too withal
That till I have thy Love obtained
my Life to me is thral:
My sweet Saint grant now my request
of all thy Sex I love thee best
Fa la la la la la la la.
Do not deny me my dear Love
my Duck my Swan my Dear
If thout'l love me as I love thee
what sorrow needst thou fear
No longer cruel be to me
I will thy faithful Lover be
Fa la la etc.
When that thou do a Spinning sit
thy servant I will be
To bring thy Cards and Wool to thee
and a kiss shall be my Fee:
My Nanny I thee needs must have
i will be no longer Cupid (...)be
Fa la la etc.
Whilst he did speak a blushing smile
appeared in her face
And to be short she did begin
to yield without disgrace
What do you mean kind John said she
fondly to set your Love on me
Fa la la la etc.
Young men are false, Maids must be wise
no life like their's is free
If you should an ill husband prove
there is none would pity me:
I love to live a Virgin Life
I care not for to be a wife
Fa la la la la la la.
If I should yield my Love to you
my sorrows would begin
And now the only care I take
to Card to Knit and Spin:
I thus do spend my time each day
whilst married folks sing well a day
Fa la la la la la la.
A married Life is full of strife
I have no mind thereto
Therefore good John I pray forbear
far better may you do
You better had to keep your breath
I will a Virgin be till death
Fa la la la etc.
My Nan said he my Dear my sweet
my Love, my joy my Life
Before I go thou shall here swear
thou will be made my wife
Oh John quoth she I dare to say
you will repent another day,
Fa la fa etc.
Well John said she I will not swear
yet yield to you my Love
Let it suffice I do promise
to be your Turtle Dove:
Since that I cannot quiet live
to you my hand and heart I give
Fa la fa, etc.
Quoth he kind heart thou have me joyus
you are welcome unto me
If till to morrow we do live
we married then will be
We Will cast away all fear and care
to kiss my Love I will not spare
Fa la fa la, etc.
Like two kind Turtles we will be
which live and Love together
Upon the pleasant Downs and Plains
we will always keep together
And when that we come home at night
to please thee still I will delight
Fa la fa la fa la.
