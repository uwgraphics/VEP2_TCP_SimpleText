Trotters Journey-man on his amble to the Gallows or the confession of John
Mew, before execution.
Gentlemen,
I Confess to have been brought up under a Trotter, but being taken from
thence by my Rider Tichbourn, and put into the Tramels of Rebellion, I soon
took a very good pace, and ever since have stepped at such a distance; that I
presumed none scruple my interferring, it being easy to have driven a
Wheel-barrow between my legs when I strutted in the head of my Regiment (some
report that being in the Tower, I should steal King Henrries Pin-cussion: and
for its safer conveyance slipped it under my twist, which occasioned my pedantick
Garb) but to that I assent not; To warn those petty Pieces of good luck which
attended me, since I dropped into the House of Office at my Mr. Pettits: Be
pleased to know, I was made a Captain of Horse (before I was a Soldier) and
being to exercise my Troop, (with Bedstaves in my Holsters) my Word of Command
was Stand to your Arms Gentlemen, by which the nimbler puppets then in motion,
thought me more sit to be a a Colonel of Foot; of which I no sooner heard, then
hasted to my place to salute my self with the Title of Nobel Colonel, and their
began to ape (as I thought) the most becoming Postures for my New Created
Honor, by which I am now become so ridiculous, (and some Dispute whether the
substance was in me, or my likeness the one being a shadow, and the other but
a vapor,) but to proceed, how busy I was in the disciplying, or rather
caneing my men: I have cause to remember having taught one of them to handle
his Arms so well, that he mademe a while after unable to lift mine to my head:
I had added to this, the Honor, of being a Militia Man, if you please, a
Malicious Man, and returning from thence somewhat late, I found a person (who
believing me an Officer of the Rump) was shiting at my Door, but I made him
know, I belonged to the Commit of Danger, though I committed him to Safety.

Who upon examination, confessed his design of Blowing open my Door, and to force
away my silver Head-peece, and my beloved Glass, in which I first see me self
a Colonel. There are some who have added to my Title of Colonel, that of
Shallow brains, but had they fathomed my dept, when I marched into Cornwall with
my brother Hewson) they would have waved it, for it might have been observable
how I guarded the blind side leaving his single eye as a Butt to any marksman in
hopes that being out, I might at last supply the office of a Dog and a Bell; to
beg the charity of the Gentlecraft: But alas! Fortune does not always favor
Fools, for now though my Case be alturd, yet my shitten luck has its period:
I now lament my impudent, intruding the Common Council, for which I was
shamefully turned out where each Man very readily lent me his foot to help me
out of the crowed, I now bewail my playing the changeling in going to the
Exchange, and thrusting my Betters from the wall, for now, alas! I cannot walk
quietly in the channel, the lesser boys being ready to piss upon me: but what
grieves me most, is I am like to be deprived of the Office of Tichbourns
Cash-keeper (from which I have sucked more sweetness, than ever he did from his
Cluster of Canaans Grapes) by the loss: of which I shall be no longer able to
proffer the Merchants ready Money, and then those that lead me out of there
Warehouses then, will kick me out now: but I do but wait till my Brother Hewson
is cut down from the Gibbet, and then I shall save them that labor.

Vale.
