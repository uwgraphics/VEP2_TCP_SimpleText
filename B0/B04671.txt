Mr. Penn's ADVICE In the Choice of Parliament Men, IN HIS Englands great
Interest in the Choice of this New Parliament;
Dedicated to all her Freeholders and Electors.
PRay see that you choose sincere Protestants: Men that don't play the
Protestant in Design, and are indeed disguised Papists, ready to pull off their
Masks when time serves: You will know such by their Laughing at the Plot,
disgracing the Evidence, admiring the Traitors Constancy that were forced to
it, or their Religion and Party were gone beyond an Excuse, or an Equivocation.
The contrary are Men that thank GOD for this Discovery, and in their
Conversation zealously direct themselves in an Opposition to the Papal
Interest, which indeed is a Combination against good Sense, Reason and
Conscience, and to introduce a blind Obedience without (if not against)
Conviction; and that Principle which introduces implicit Faith and blind
Obedience in Religion, will also introduce implicit Faith and blind Obedience
in Government; so that it is no more the Law in the one than in the other, but
the Will and power of the Superior, that shall be the Rule and Bond of our
Subjection: This is that Fatal Mischief Propery brings with it to civil
Society, and for which such Societies ought to be aware of it, and All those
that are Friends to it. [ Page 4.]

The abovesaid being not unseasonable at this present Conjuncture, it is
thought meet to have it thus Published this Fourth of December, 1688.

FINIS.
