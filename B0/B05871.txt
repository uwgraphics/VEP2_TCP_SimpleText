THE VOICE of the JUST Uttered: His passing out of Egypt through the Red Sea,
through the Wilderness to the Promised Land, where rest and peace is enjoyed.
By him who is known to the World by the Name of THOMAS SYMONDS.
Many false Spirits are entered into the World, who are seen, tried, and found
out with the light of Christ, although it they oppose, and seek to darken with
all their dark powers.

Yet Christ's Voice a torment is to the unclean Spirits, known of them but not
followed; his sheep hear his voice, and they follow him in the strait and
narrow way, through tribulations, trialls, and persecutions, which is embraced
of all those that dwell in the light, and so come to the inheritance, the Crown
of life.


I Being quiet and still in my habitation, feeding upon the bread of life,
known and enjoyed in the light of life, the former dealings of the Lord was
brought to my remembrance, and in love to the souls of men and women I am made
to publish and make known these things which follow, which cannot be hid, for
the command to me is, what is revealed, to thee in secret, that preach thou on
the house tops, and what is made known unto thee in thy closet, that publish
abroad and let my secrets to thee be no longer hid, the candle of the Lord
being lighted in me, searching me from the beginning, and showing me the sins
of my you h, and now knowing that when I had committed sin in my youth, the
light of Christ in my conscience discovered it, and reproved me ever since the
time of my being a child, but I not knowing where to wait ran from place to
place, from one man to another, who had the greatest name in godliness and
profession of holiness, but Physicians they were of no value, sometimes I
found them daubing as it were with untempered mortar, and would have healed
that which was to be cut and wounded, and bruised the head of the serpent while
it stood, acted I was in wickedness, and so from day to day, I went under, a
wounded spirit, which made me cry day and night by prayer to the Lord as I
thought to be at a distance from me, and Christ that had enlightened me with his
light which was then prsent with me to let me see my condition, and wounded
Estate, that I would not own for my guide this condition I continued in till
about eighteen years of age, and then much calling and crying out there was of
the priests of those times (whom I delighted to hear) to go forth into the
war, harkening to their cry I entered into the war without me, thinking thereby
to be beloved of God for my forwardness in that work, and the war within me
did somewhat cease, but not wholly, for I sound the searcher of all hearts the
light of Christ in me condemning reproving me in secret, and often when I have
been to engage with my enemies without me, my sins have been set in order
before me, which has made me even to faint before them, but the resolvednesse
in me, and the justness of my cause as I thought, carried me on to encounter,
but this brought not my enemies within me to the slaughter, but strength they
got by it, I reasoning thus with my self, I had fought the Lords battle, and
henceforth there was laid up a sure reward for me, and this sometimes did quiet
me till the Lord uttered his voice in his habitation; then came I to see with
the light of Christ that my iniquities were not yet blotted out, then sorrow
would sease upon me, and sadness, palenesse of face, so that I was long kept
to the admiring of many, and when at any time I had been drawn out to receive
the creature to the abusing of my body, which I see overtooke me, I not being
kept dilligent and watchful, the severe Judgments of God would follow me and
rest depart from me, then mourning and lamenting was my portion, and sorrowing,
and sighing, with much heaviness of spirit from the oppressed in me did
proceed, then such persuasion there was in me, that I should join with those
people called Annabaptists and did contend much when I came with those that did
oppose me (for water baptism) taking Scriptures to prove the necessity of it,
but in a short time, I came to see the emptiness and huskinesse of it, and so
became dead to it, and the witness of God the light arising in me though the
power of it I little knew, my condition in measure I was brought to know, and
to see my self naked and wretched, then to reading of Scriptures and praying I
did much give my self, and at times much tears and weeping I was brought into,
then looking upon them as tears of repentance there would be some quietness in
my spirit, and a calm for sometime, but that remaining in me strong and
uncrucified, the Lust; from whence wars did proceed, peace would not long
continue, the light of Christ in my conscience being sinned against, for the
virtue and strength of it, I was then ignorant of, but in this my time of
ignorance the Lords working power in me his light was not put out though often
quenched and sinned against, and this was the Lords love to my soul to waken
and quicken me morning by morning, and in the night season call me to an
account with his light, of life and power, with it I now see he has enlightened
every one that comes into the world and that with his light Christ Jesus has
and does, and shall leave all men without excuse eternally before the pure God
who is light and in him is no darkness at all, but all who have and does and
shall abide in his light, have and does and shall know, that in it is life and
power, and it is able to cleanse and purify the heart, and abiding in it, the
heart Soul and body is kept clean in the sight of the pure God, and so the
peace of God come to be known of all those that abide in his light which
shines in all consciences though darkness comprehend it not, yet light
comprehend and discover it in man, allthough man by his strange inventions
seek to darken the glorious light, as when I was afflicted and tossed too and
fro with the slight and cunning of men's inventions, for when many conditions I
had passed through as before mentioned and still the Lord in his love was
searching me with his light, and with it I did see sin standing, which caused
trouble and restlessnesse, then the docctine of free grace (so called) was
preached to me that Christ had suffered for sinners, and his suffering was
free, his mercy free, his love, his grace free, so there was nothing for me to
do, but to believe these things, which Doctrine was soon received by me, for
it was pleasing to the fleshly mind as it was then held forth and declared, by
the blind guides of the world, and now I know that his love, grace, mercy, and
light is free, but this must go with it, abide in his-love, in his mercy, in
his grace, and light, and here is something to do contrary to the will of man,
and this answers Christ's words, who says, if ye abide in the vine, etc. he
further exhorting them; abide in me, and I in you, as the branch cannot bear
fruit of it self, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide
in me, which man to own I now see he must deny himself, and take up the
Cross, and deny that liberty which all the professors of the world are
pleading for, who are out of the life, and enemies to the light, so these
things above mentioned, being in the time of my ignorance blindness, and
darkness, received into my understanding, the work of God was stopped and the
witness his light in me, quenched, then carelessness, and wildness, and
unstaiednesse, with me increased, and I could be merry, and sport my self in
the day time and so grew sottish, dark, and dull, and my profession withered,
and my zeal abated, and my stayednesse, and soberness was turned into
wantonness, and laughter, and could plead for it, that it was the liberty of
the Saints, to be merry and cheerly in the world, else it might dishonor the
Gospel, and discourage others, and in this condition I was for some years,
after I had taken a wise and fell to trading, and much buying and selling, and
great acquaintance with man I began to have, and to increase in my estate as to
the outward, then I grew tall and great in my thoughts, and began to think the
Lot of my inheritance was in a good place, then with my fellow tradesmen I
delighted often to be in Taverns, Inns, and drinking houses, and often times,
and money I spent that way, and thought it my liberty so to dee, and some small
covering of profession was still with me, which hid me from the world, as
praying, and reading in my family, and going to the chiefest places of worship
so counted, but all this would not hide, nor cover me from the wrath of the
Lamb, and now my fellow tradesmen, and sometimes companions in wickedness, in
excess of drinking, eating, and wicked singing, and idle jestings, and foolish
laughter, in the day time and often in the night season be warned to flee and
shun, all foolish laughter, and wantonness, and idle communication which
corrupts the good manners, and wait in the light of Christ, which convinces
you of sin, and of your ungodly deeds, to know the living God, who sometimes
you will talk of and in words profess him, but in works deny him, for all
works of darkness, are contrary to the pure God, who if ever you come to know
you must know him a consuming fire to all your idle filthy, foolish unclean,
corrupt communications, and to all your lusts and pleasures, which ye at
present take delight and live in, poor hearts, there is a tenderness in me
toward you, and all men; consider your estates, your living carelessly as to
your eternal estate, your bodies growing far, with ease and fullness, but
enter in to your own closers, and let the door be shut, and be quiet and still
in your spirits, and with the light of Christ diligently search and see the
leanesse and starvedness of your souls and how faint and feeble they are that
the pantings and breathings after God from the innocent in you, (which lies
oppressed) you may come to know, and your present conditions come to see, in
the light, for really when you come to be searched and sound out with eternal
light of God Christ Jesus, then woe to you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn
and lament, and your joy and gladness, will be turned into sighing, and bitter
weeping, for the life of sin and wickedness you have lived in and still take
delight in, this I now know and see, in the eternal light of God, that it is
your present states and conditions, for it is not long since I was in that
state with you, which was pleasing to my fleshly mind, though while I was with
you in that mirth and delight, to the sinful mind, yet the Lord was present
to condemn me, with his light, and this, if you will deal plainly with your
own hearts in particular, with the light of Christ you may come to see the Lord
condemning you in the midst of all your mirth, and witnessing with his light in
you against your ungodly deeds, in the midst of your sportings, and riotings,
thus it was with me, whilst I with you in wickedness did join, which was until
near the time called Michaelmas in the year 1654. I then journying toward
Cambridge purposing to take my delight at that place called Sturbidg fair, and
hearing of a people in Cambridge called Quakers, I had a great desire to see
them, although they were counted as the off scouring of the world, some of the
people being then prisoners, after my stay one night in that place I went to
prison to see the despised one of the world named Anne Blackely who is a mother
in Israel, I seeing her sober stayed countenance after some little space began
to ask her some questions which she in discreet, and wise manner answered with
much tenderness to me, she seeing in the eternal light of God my condition,
spoke as she was moved to the witness of God in me, which did soon answer the
soundness of her words, and I was brought into much tenderness and many were
the tears that then fell from mine eyes, and really such a condition I was
then in as I was never made sensible of before, in all the time of my
profession, for I was pierced, and wounded, and made sensible of my condition,
and exhorted where to wait, which exhortation took deep root in me, it not
parting from me day nor night, but to the light of Christ in my conscience I
was kept which brought me into soberness, and stayednesse, so the inten, ded
evil of my journey, I was kept from, and soon after departed out of that
town, toward my outward being, which was at Norwich, where I had and have a
wife and tender babes, who were, and are dear unto me in their places, but the
form of my countenance being changed from laughter and foolish jesting into
soberness and stayednesse, caused a change in my wife at that time she
weeping, and crying out, and asking me often what I ayled, for long I lay under
Judgment, mourning sighing, and groaning, the innocent in me to be delivered,
and pangs took hold on me, for the delivering of the man child, and then
groans and sighs I came really to know, which could not, nor cannot be uttered,
and then the ministrations of condemnation which is glorious in its time, I
came to know, and when under the greatest condemnation, and judgment I was
brought, and sensible of a spirit of burning in me, then had the innocent one
in me, which never consented to sin, pure joy peace and comfort, from the Lord,
and my members to it was brough: into subjection and so became the members of
Christ, and not any more to become the members of an harlot, neither any more
to go a whoring after my lovers, but according to what was made manifest to
me, in the light I was made to own the cross, and despise the shame, and in
my obedience I did see, and taste, that much coming was the love of God to me,
and the just in me, got strength and power, and although many trials and
temptations I met with from enemies without, and enemies within me, yet through
them all I see good brought forth, to the clearing of the innocent, and
strengthening of the just which live by faith, and through the greatest
straights and troubles can rejoice, and that above written was my estate and
condition for many months together, so that a wonder I was, and amazed they
were at me, that formerly knew me, and a great noise of my condition went
abroad, and many lies were uttered forth, concerning me, as that I was mad and
bound in my bed, and seven men could not hold me, and many such things was
invented by the devil in his children who are sit instruments for his purpose,
who ever hated the children of the light, and Christ Jesus who is the light of
the world, and has enlightened every one that comes into the world, by his
children was put to death.

I say, many things was raised and invented of me, as that I had given up
Trading, and left off my Calling, which thing was utterly false, that they
accused me and the truth of, although I walked along the streets about my
business in the outward daily. And poor hearts, who make lies your refuge,
this know, that where the truth of God is made manifest in the light of Jesus,
and lived in in the life and power, none can or dare take liberty to idleness,
and sloathfulnesse in business, but every one in their places are made to be
faithful and honest therein, doing what they do as in the sight of God, and
so become blameless to that of God in every man's conscience, and justified in
the sight of God, we doing unto all men, as we would that all men should do
unto us, not defrauding, conzening, or cheating any, nor using deceitful words,
to make any believe a lie, but in plainness of speech, with fewness of words,
in singleness and uprightness of heart, we are ordered with the light of
Christ in our lives and conversations, toward all men with whom we have to
do, in this crooked and perverse Generation. So all you that have reviled and
reproached the Lords people, scornfully by you called Quakers, it is time for
you to stop your mouths, and lie low in the dust, and repent while you have
time, and say not in your hearts it will be time enough afterward, lest the
Lord come suddenly in an hour you know not, and sweep you away in your sins,
and so you receive your portion with the damned spirits, and kept in the lake
of darkness and torment, their habitation, from whence there will be no
returning any more to the Land of the living, neither shall a drop of water be
granted in the midst of your torment and burnings, to cool your tongues, which
has spoken lies of the innocent; therefore be warned in your lifetime, you
blind people Some of the lies which was raised of me, was received by one of
your blind guides of this City, and preached of by him in his high place, but
the Lord has put an end to his days, as to the life, and his reward is with
him. But herein this wicked and rebellious City, who are up in rebellion
against the Lord and his chosen elected ones, they gathering about the doors
of the innocent: Now see wherein you differ from that wicked City Sodom, for
idleness and fulness of bread was found in it, and against it, and all
wickedness in this City, I am, and a witness do stand in innocence, and
harmlesnesse, against this lying, evil, inventing, devouring Generation, by
whom I am made a mock, a taunt, a by word, and them against me do set their
mouths awry and am persecuted and reviled, hated, and daily mocked at as I
pass the streets, and I patiently bear it; being reviled I entreat,
persecuted, I suffer it, and can rejoice in the midst of all, and through the
strength of my God am kept above them all, Glory, Glory, be given to the pure
living God, for ever, Amen, who has kept me, and does keep me alive in his
light of life, from this destroying devouring generation of unreasonable men,
of whom the righteous God, in his righteousness will be avenged, and eased of
these his advesaries, and this is according to Scriptures which you pretend is
your rule, although your lives, practices, and daily walkings they declare
against, and when any of your wickedness is declared against by any servants of
the Lord, who dwell in the light, you are presently ready to fall upon
perfection, allthough it be not mentioned by us, you crying out that none can
be perfect here, none can be without sin here, where is there one Scripture
that will maintain these words, this was the Scribes, and pharisees estate,
who sought to put the Lamb of God Christ Jesus to death, says he, I go away,
and you shall dye in your sins, now, that are crying out, and accusing us for
being papists, Consider who are nearer them you, or we, for if there be not a
place of purging after death, what will become of you, for into Heaven there
shall enter no unclean thing, nor nothing that works abomination, or makes
a lie, and you that plead for these things, look to it in your life time, and
be warned, and own the light of Christ, and it will let you see that the grave
adds no perfection, and as the tree falls so it lies, and if you dye in your
sins, Christ goes away, and whether he goes ye cannot come, This is to all
you who plead for sin, would live in, and dye in your sins, you must not
go where Christ goes, and this is according to Scriptures, and you that deny
to be guided by his light, in your life time, are workers of iniquity, the word
is gone forth depart ye workers of iniquity into utter darkness, there shall
be weeping, wayling, and gnashing of teeth, and Christ will not know you, and
this is according to Scriptures, ye scribes and pharisees, what will ye do
if you dye in your sins, where does the Scriptures speak of any cleansing
after death, and you that are pleading always to live in sin, and none can
be without sin here, how can the words of Christ be owned and received by
you, who said unto the woman taken in adultrie, go thy way sin no more, and
to the impotent man, lest a worse thing come unto thee, so be warned, for you
must be called to an account, and you shall be rewarded according to your
works, and deeds done in the body, and this is according to Scriptures, which
are as a cloud of witnesses against you, and witnesses for the innocent people
scornfully, and reproachfully by you called Quakers, who are brought to
witness the truth of them, in their lives and conversations, and therefore are
hated of the world, who love their own, and if we were of the world, the world
would love us, but because we are not of the world, therefore the world hates
us, as it was from the beginning, so it is now known and seen in the light,
according as the Scriptures declares, they that are borne after the flesh,
persecute those that are borne after the spirit, even so it is unto this day,
poor hearts, you are warned and the witness of God in you, will witness for
me, and against your ungodly deeds.

So though I be counted a soole to the world, and of them hated, it is for
Christ's sake, and my wisdom I counted not too dear to give up unto him, and
though a mad man as Paul was counted, yet stayed in the light, and speaking the
words of soberness unto all men, with whom I have to do, and as one that is
dead, but alive unto God; and I counted not my life dear unto him, who has
called me, and has made known his mighty power in me, whereby I know that he
is in me, and I in him, and so redeemed out of the world, and from the Teachers
of it, not any longer to be deceived by them, but in the eternal light of God
I do them see, and comprehend, and know them to be of that sort spoken of in
the Scriptures, who shall and do lead silly women Captive, laden with sin, and
pleading for no live in it, led away with diverse lusts, ever learning, but
never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. But it they are taught to
oppose, the light of Christ, by the blind guides of the world, who are sensual
having not the Spirit, as is made manifest by their works and fruits, they
living in pride and covetousness, in envy and malice, haling and cause to be
haled those that are moved of the Lord, to witness against their ungodly
practices; and now all people who have any soberness and stayednesse,
remaining, and any desire to know the Lord God, who have created you, and with
his light enlightened you, to the light of Christ take heed, which reproves you
of sin and evil, allthough you act it never so secretly, and leave the
blind guides of the world, and their silthy saigned words deny, for by them
they seek to make merchandise of your souls, feed them no longer with dishonest
gain lest they destroy the simplicity in you, and you perish with them who deny
the light of Christ, to be sufficient to guide the creature unto God, and call
it natural, and so would have a natural Christ suitable to their natural
fleshly minds, but he is a spirit, and comes from the father of spirits, and
all who come to know him, must know him in his l ght, and worship God in spirit
and in truth, and all who are brought into Christ's right to wait, know him to
be a qu ckning spirit, and that he is made manifest in flesh, to discover and
destroy sin in the flesh, this is known to the Children of light, but hid from
the dark world, who perish in their iniquities, from the wise and prudent, and
is revealed to babes and sucklings, even so holy father, for so it seemed good
in thy sight. And now a few lines to you all dear friends, who have had a
taste of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, keep in
the taste, and knowledge, your minds stayed in the light, and in the eternal
stillness to dwell, not striving in your own wisdoms to Comprehend the truth,
this is not your work, neither will you come to a growth by it, but your work
is to stand still in the light, the life to know, and there feed, that ye may
see Pharaoh the oppressor, his Chariots, and mighty ones overturned and drowned
in the red Sea, and the soul saved, and the creature redeemed out of Egypt and
bondage, the promised Land you to enjoy, which brings forth all pleasant riches
which is durable, and fades not away.

Dear hearts fight not in your wills, neither strive in your wisdoms, but
stand still in the light, and know the battle is the Lords, you that are
entered into the wane, you being quiet, and patient, and still in your spirits,
the limb shall get the victory, over the uncircumcised Philistians, and hard
hearted Pharachs, you being stayed in the light, there is your power, and it
will give you victory over the unclean spirits and uncircumcised in hearts,
and ears and in the power and authority of the Lord God, known in the light,
trample upon them all, that they shall be ashes under your feet, this I know,
who am your brother in the eternal truth, and therein stand as a witness
against all those that know not God, who am known, and by their scornfully
called Quaker.
