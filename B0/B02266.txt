THE PREFACE
FOR the Publication of this little Book, I may not make use of the Instance of
the Painter, that took an Eye from one, a Limb from another, and a Complexion
from a third, etc. lest some should expect too much Excellency here: know this,
that it was only a Collection, with several Additions and Alterations for my
own Family: But some seeing of it, desired that it might be made public. I am
very sensible that the right performance of this Duty in Verse, in a Spiritual
manner, is of greater difficulty than Prayer and Praise is in Prose; because
here the Words and Composure is not our own: For all Psalmody falling under the
Rules of Art, and confined to Sounds, there is not that freedom of Soul to
express the present Conceptions of our Mind and Spirit as in Prose, though many
times the Verse hits upon the very thoughts of our Hearts; and may express them
better than we could our selves; but this is accidental. I confess this is one
of the Arguments for Forms of Prayer; and truly I must own there is a necessity
of betaking our selves to well Composed Forms in Hymns and Psalms; for I know
of no Ministers or Christians that pretend to any accuracy in sudden extempory
Hymns, or putting a Psalm of David into Verse, so well suddenly, as they can by
Study, Premeditation, and Composure; especially for the use and benefit of
others: It is not my business here to dispute, others have well answered all
other Baxter's Paraph on Psalms
Objections against this Duty. It Is easily understood that he that Prays is the
mouth of all the rest, and it is their great Duty that join with him, to labor
affectionately, to go along with him in their Spirits, and at last to say Amen
to all that they apprehend has been according to the will of God: But in
Psalms and Hymns they are all Mouths, all vocally Praise God, therefore ought
to hear before hand, or have it before them in a Book what is to be Sung; and
this must not be only to avoid Confusion, but it is necessary in all Harmony,
that Words and Sounds be Concordantly the same: And here lies the difference
between Prayer and Praise in Verse, or Psalmody, and Prayer and Praise in
Prose; this first being vocally expressed by one, the other vocally expressed
by all. It must be acknowledged that there must be a due regard had to variety
of Psalms and Hymns, lest we dull and cloy our selves in the use of this
Spiritual and Evangelical Duty: and indeed I cannot but express my experience
in this matter, that an excellent new and well composed Hymn, or the often
varying in this ordinance does much affect me; and I believe all persons will
acknowledge, that the often or constant use of the same Psalm or Hymn, has not
such a tendency to stir up such lively affections: And I need not tell any the
reason of this, that knows any thing of the Soul of Man; and the humane nature:
which must be delighted even in the worship of God. I hope some will collect
more and better for the benefit of the Church, and those that do believe* and
that none will gru^^h us this most ancient, useful, nay glorious employment: if
they do they are worse than the Heathen Pliny, who gives an account of the
Christians (not scoffingly) in his time; this being one part of their
character, that it was their practice to sing praises to God, and to one Jesus,
whom they called their Redeemer, before the break of day.

If any shall benefit by the use of this little Collection, or be excited to
set upon the Work and do it far better; it is that which I hope for, earnestly
desiring God may have the glory, and believers Souls the help and advantage, by
such an attempt.

Yours etc.

A Collection of Hymns.
Hymn out of the 104 Psalm. The Power and Goodness of God in the Creation and
Governments of the World, celebrated with Praise.
Part. I. The Majesty and Greatness of God.
D. W.
I.
COme, O, my Soul! my nobler part,
Thy noblest powers now bring;
Rouse up thy self with ravished heart,
Thy Maker's praise to sing.
II.
O mighty Lord! my God and King,
How shall my meanness treat
Of thee, and of thy Glories sing,
Who art exceeding great!
III.
Eternal Being, who to none,
Do thine Existence owe;
All things that are did thou alone
Make out of nothing grow.
IV.
Invisible to Mortal Eye,
To The World is God displayed,
With Glory and with Majesty,
In his own Works aray'd.
V.
When thou design'st, Lord, to our sight,
Thy self to manifest,
First in a Robe of spotless Light,
Thou did thy self invest.
VI.
Then as a glittering Diadem
Thou fram'st the Firmament,
(Wherein each Star shines as a Gem)
stretched to a vast extent.
VII.
On Waters raised unto the Sky,
Thou mighty Beams have laid,
And meet for thy Great Majesty
A Royal Palace made.
VIII.
The blackest Clouds with brightest Beams,
The glorious Sun does gild;
These are thy Chariots, from them streams
Light, which thy Glory fills.
IX.
When thou descend'st to cast an Eye
On these inferior things;
In these thou rid'st, or else do fly,
Making the Wind thy wings.
X.
Bright Angels stand before thy face;
At thy Command thy go;
With such winged speed they run their Race;
Swift flames to them are slow.
Part II. God's Creation of the Earth and Sea.
I.
Thou have the Pillars of the Earth,
On Basis set so fast,
Unmoved they from the World's first-birth,
Unto its end shall last.
II.
Thou over the Infant's Earth's bare face,
A Purple Vail do spread,
Of Waters weaved coucht in the place,
Where Hills now show their head.
III.
But that the Earth might see the light,
And smile on springing day;
Thy Voice like Thunder did afright,
And rend those Vails away.
IV.
The Mountains that in watery Beds
Lay sleeping, heard thy call,
And starting, raised up their heads,
Stood looking over all.
V.
The Vails afrighted, straight began
To sink and shrink away;
The frighted Waters trembling ran,
And in their bosom lay.
VI.
But lest the Waters should at length
Cast off their captive Chain,
And growing bold, should by their strength
Their Empire lost regain.
VII.
For ever thou to check their Pride
Have by thy mighty hand
Fixed them a bound, forced to abide
Within a wall of Sand.
VIII.
Beside the mighty Valley made,
The Chanel of the Sea,
A Thousand Valleys in the shade
Of raised Mountains lay.
IX.
And that the Valleys might not want
The Waters that were fled,
Some of these Captives did recant
And back again were led.
X.
Led through the Chambers of the Earth,
In dark and secret ways,
Till Born again by a new birth,
They saw the Sun's Bright Rays.
Part III. Gods Provision for all his Creatures.
I.
The mighty God who Rules all things,
Makes Valleys fresh and gay,
With Crystal stream's from silver springs,
Where Flocks both feed and play.
II.
These Waters with their purling Rills,
Make pleasant harmony;
And whilst they dance amongst the Hills,
Delight both Ear and Eye.
III.
Wild Asses, and the tamer Beasts,
Do here both Drink and Dine;
Their Pastures are their pleasant Feasts:
Their Waters are their Wine.
IV.
That no delights behind may stay,
The Birds their Music bring,
And while the Beasts do feed and play,
The Birds in branches sing.
V.
And lest the Mountains should complain,
That though they thirsted first,
They still may thirst, and not obtain
One drop to quench their thirst.
VI.
God from his Chambers looking down,
His Blessings on them pours,
With flowery Blossoms does them Crown,
Produced by pleasant showers.
VII.
The Earth has mighty appetites,
But God does still provide
A feast to which he all invites,
And all are satisfied.
VIII.
For Beasts, he makes the Earth produce
The Grass a grateful food,
And pleasant Herbs to, for the use
Of Man, to both he is good.
IX.
Of man and of his food has he
Made Earth the common Sourse,
That Man might know the Earth to be
His Mother and his Nurse.
X.
He feeds him with the finest Bread,
And makes his Face to shine
With Oil, and when his Joys are dead,
He chears his Heart with Wine.
Part IV. God's admirable Providence in the Government of the World.
I.
THE stately Trees that grow upon
Dry Hills, no moistute want,
The Cedar, King in Lebanon,
Is Gods own Royal Plant.
II.
Within these Trees, Birds for their young
Build little nurseries.
The Stork to save her self from wrong
Unto the Fir Tree flies.
III.
Wild Goats themselves to Hills betake
As Castles of Defense;
And Rocks the weaker Coneys make
Shields for their innocence.
IV.
The Sun and Moon, the King and Queen
Of Heavens bright Court above,
By all the lower World are seen
In state to shine and move.
V.
The Moon this lower World to Grace
Gives night the Face of day;
At length she shows but half a Face
And turns her self away.
VI.
Thus by her changes she defines
The Periods of our time,
The Sun in brighter glory shines,
And does much higher climb.
VII.
But yet this glorious height and light,
Secures not from a fall:
With thousand Lamps, the sable Night
Sets forth his Funeral.
VIII.
The Earth then puts her Mourning on,
Then darkness is her Vail,
Then all her loveliness is gone,
All her delights do fail.
IX.
Then Salvages that hate the Light,
Which might their thefts bewray,
Under the Curtains of the night,
Securely seek their prey.
X.
Then the fierce Tyrants of the VVood,
Whose force none dare withstand;
Young Lions roar and seek their food
From God Almighty's hand.
XI.
But now the Sun Revives again,
And with him brings the Day,
In Dens, where they before had lain,
Themselves again they lay.
XII.
Thus Beasts of Prey give place to men,
As Darkness does to Light:
Man safely minds his business then
Till day resigns to night.
Part V. God's Riches fills the Earth and Sea.
I.
In all these works (how many fold)
Thy Glories, Lord, do shine;
In them such Wisdom we behold,
We know the works are thine.
II.
Vast sums thy Royal Treasuries,
The Earth and Sea contain,
Though still laid out for our supplies,
They still return again.
III.
Vast Troops well armed with Silver Scales,
Do forage in the Sea;
There sports the mighty Giant Whales;
There Pigmy fishes play.
IV.
Small Ships there ride on mighty Waves,
And as they rise and fall,
Men sail among high Tombs, deep Graves,
Yet fear no Funeral.
Part VI. All Creatures are sustained by God.
I.
All Creatures, Lord, which thou have made,
Upon thee waiting stand;
Their strength does fail, their beauty fade,
Not cherisht by thy hand.
II.
But thou, O God, who gav'st them life,
Sustain'st them all with food;
Thou scatter'st, they with busy strife,
Straight gather what is good.
III.
Thy smiles do make them brisk and gay,
Thy favor is their joy;
But if thou turn'st thy self away,
They mourn, and faint, and die.
IV.
Their life and breath is in thine hand,
Thy strength's their stay and trust;
Sustained or left by thee they stand
or fall, and turn to dust.
V.
And when they are left by thee, they fall,
And lifeless dust remain;
By thy life-breathing Sp'rit they all,
Revive and live again.
VI.
The face then of the fruitful Earth
Is with new beauty blessed,
And all her Children sing for mirth,
In new Apparel dressed.
VII.
The World is changed by Power Divine,
But God is still the same
In all his works his Glory shines,
Eternizing his Name.
Part VII. God is to be praised for his dreadful Majesty and wonderful Works.
I.
He sits on an Eternal Throne,
With Mercy clothed and Might;
The works his hands has wrought alone,
Are still his hearts delight.
II.
If in his Robes of Majesty,
He to the Earth draw near,
Or cast from Heaven a flaming Eye,
The Earth trembling faints for fear.
III.
Of if he his Almighty hand
On th'Mountains heads does lay,
The Mountains can no longer stand,
But smoke and melt away.
IV.
I will extol with noble Praise
This mighty God and King,
While vital Breath prolong my days,
His Praises I will sing.
V.
My heart and tongue with holy strife,
Shall in his Praises be
Continual Rivals all my life,
For Joy one Jubilee.
VI.
Let those who do this Lord despise,
And against his Law rebel,
As Rebels, fall, and never rise,
But sink from Earth to Hell.
VII.
But, Oh my Soul! my ravished Heart,
Praise thou The Almighty King;
Let all his Subjects bear a part,
And Hallelujah sing.
Hymn II. as the 148 Psalm.
COme Hallelujah sing,
Jehovah's Praise proclaim
From Heaven, till Earth do ring
In The* heights extol his fame,
His Glory raise
Ye Armiesall
Angelical,
With glorious Praise.
Thy Beams, O Sun by day!
Thy Rays, O Moon by night!
Unto his Praise display,
Praise him ye Stars of Light;
His Praise declare
Ye Heavens above,
And Clouds that move
I'th'empty Air;
O let them praise the Name
Of this all-glorious Lord,
For at his call they came,
Created by his Word;
For ever he
Has fixed them fast;
For there he past
A firm Decree.
The Lord who all things keeps,
Praise ye from Earth below,
Ye Dragons and all deeps,
Ye Fire, and Hail, and Snow,
And Vapors stirred
By stormy Winds
Which he does bind
Or loose by's Word.
Ye Mountains which do raise
Your Heads to Heaven, and all
Ye Hills and Mountains praise,
Fruit Trees and Cedars tall;
Beasts, wild and tame,
Each creeping thing,
All Birds of wing
Exalt his Name.
Ye Kings of great command,
And Men of meaner birth,
Ye potent Princes, and
All Judges of the Earth,
Both Young Men all,
Maids in their prime,
Men hoard with time,
And Children small:
O let them join and raise
Jehovah's Name on high;
His Name's above their praise,
Exalted gloriously
With Rays Divine
His Glory bright
Obscures Earth's Light,
And The Heavens outshine.
Gloria Patri.
To th'Father and the Son,
And Holy Ghost now be
All glory unto one
True God and Persons three;
As 'twas, is when
Times measure ends,
His Praise transcends
All time; Amen.
The Angels and Churches Hymn.
Glory to God on high,
And Peace to Men below;
Now God in Grace is nigh,
And Blessings to bestow.
All Glory then
To th'Father too,
The Son also,
And Spirit; Amen.
Hymn III. as 148 Psalm.
D. W.
GIve laud unto the Lord,
From the Celestial Coasts;
All ye his Praise record,
His Angels and his Hosts
Him glorify;
Sun, Moon and Stars,
(Yea highest Spheres)
And cloudy Sky.
O let them praise his Name,
Since made by his command,
Who 'stablish'd all the frame
Perpetually to stand;
He also made
A firm Decree,
Which needs must be
By them obeyed.
Praise God from Earth below,
Ye Dragons and all Deeps,
Fire, Hail, Clouds, Wind, and Snow,
Whom in command he keeps:
Hills low and high,
Trees all that grow,
Beasts swift or slow,
Fouls all that fly.
Kings and the vulgar throng,
Princes and Judges all,
Yea men and maidens young,
Old men and children small,
Praise ye his name,
Who Is name alone
As the only one
Extol in fame.
Whose glory bright does blaze
Above the Earth and Sky,
Of all his Saints the praise
He sets their Horn on high,
Even those that spring
Of Israel's race
Much in his Grace,
His praises sing.
Hymn III. as the 148 Psalm.
YE holy Angels bright,
Which stand before Gods Throne,
And dwell in glorious light,
Praise ye the Lord each one.
You there so nigh,
Fitter than we
Dark sinners be,
For things so high.
You blessed Souls at rest,
Who see your Saviors face,
Whose glory, even the least
Is far above our Grace;
God's praises sound
As in his sight
With sweet delight
You do abound.
All Nations of the Earth
Extol the Worlds great King,
With melody and mirth
His glorious praises sing,
For he still reigns,
And will bring low
The proudest foe,
That him disdains.
Sing forth Jehovah's praise,
Ye Saints that on him call,
Magnify him always,
His holy Churches all:
In him rejoice,
And there proclaim
His Holy Name
With sounding voice.
My Soul bear thou thy part,
Triumph in God above,
With a well tuned heart,
Sing thou the Songs of love;
Thou art his own,
Whose precious blood
Shed for thy good
His love made known.
He did in love begin,
Renewing thee by Grace,
Forgiving all thy Sin,
Showed thee his pleased Face:
He did thee heal
By his own merit,
And by his Spirit
He did thee Seal.
In saddest thoughts and grief,
In sickness, fears, and pain,
I cried for his relief,
And did not cry in vain,
He heard with speed,
And still I found
Mercy abound
In time of need.
Let not his praises grow
On prosperous heighths alone,
But in the Vales below
Let his great love be known;
Let no distress
Curb and Control
My Winged Soul,
And Praise suppress.
Part II.
Let not the fear or smart
Of his chastising Rod,
Take off my fervent Heart
From praising my dear God;
Still let me kneel
And to him bring
This offering,
What e're I feel.
Though I lose friends and wealth,
And bear reproach and shame,
Though I lose ease and health,
Still let me praise Gods name;
That fear and pain
Which would destroy
My thanks and joy,
Do thou restrain.
Though humane help depart,
And Flesh draw near to dust,
Let Faith keep up my Heart
To love God true and just,
And all my Days
Let no disease
Cause me to cease
His joyful praise.
Though sin would make me doubt,
And fill my Soul with fears;
Though God seem to shut out
My daily Cries and Tears;
By no such frost
Of sad delays,
Let thy sweet praise
Be nipt and lost.
Away distrustful care,
I have thy promise Lord,
To banish all despair
I have thy Oath and Word,
And therefore I
Shall see thy face,
And there thy Grace
Shall Magnify.
Though sin and death conspire
To rob thee of thy praise,
Toward thee I Will aspire,
And thou dull hearts can raise;
Open thy door,
And when grim death
Shall stop his breath
I Will praise thee more.
With thy triumphant flock,
Then I shall numbered be:
Built on the eternal Rock
His Glory we shall see.
The Heavens so high
With praise shall ring,
And all shall sing
In harmony.
The Sun is but a spark
From the eternal Light,
Its brightest beams are dark,
To that most glorious sight;
There the whole choire
With one accord
Shall praise the Lord
For evermore.
Hymn V. of three parts. 1. Confession. 2. Petition. 3. Thanks-givi^^ Coll.
LORD from the horrid deep, my cries
Ascend unto thine Ear,
Do not my mournful voice despise,
But my Petition hear.
I do confess that I received
My very shape in sin,
In it my Mother me conceived,
And brought me forth therein.
Numberless evils compass me,
My sins do me assail,
More than my very hairs they be,
So that my heart does fail.
But there is Mercy to be had
With thee, and pardoning Grace,
That men may be encouraged,
With fear to seek thy face.
Have Mercy Lord, and pity take
On me in this distress,
For thine abundant mercy sake,
Blot out my wickedness.
My youthful sins do thou deface,
Keep them not on record,
But after thine abundant Grace
Remember me O Lord.
Lord hide thy face from all my sins,
And my misdeeds deface,
O God make clean my heart within,
Renew it with thy Grace;
From every presumptuous crime,
Thy Servant Lord restrain;
And let them not at any time
The least dominion gain.
Blessed is he to whom the Lord
Imputes not his sin,
Whose heart has all deceit abhorred,
And guile's not found therein.
O then let joy and gladness speak,
And let me hear their voice,
That so the bones which thou did break,
May feelingly rejoice.
Then bless the living Lord, my Soul;
His glorious praise proclaim,
Let all my inward powers extol,
And bless his holy name,
Forget not all his benefits,
But bless the Lord my Soul,
Who all thy trespasses remits,
And makes thee sound and whole.
Behold what wondrous love on us
The Father has bestowed,
That we should be advanced thus
And called the Sons of God.
Because thy loving kindness is
Better than length of days,
And preciouser than life its self,
My Lips shall speak thy praise.
With Marrow and sweet Fatness filled,
My thankful Soul shall be,
My Mouth shall join with joyful lips,
In giving praise to thee.
For whom have I in Heaven but thee?
Nor is there any one
In all the World desired of me,
Besides thy self alone.
Though flesh consume and heart be broke,
And all do fail me sore,
Yet God's my hearts unshaken Rock,
And portion evermore.
The path of Life thou will show me:
With thee are all the Treasures
Of Joy, and at thy right hand be
The everlasting pleasures.
Goodness and Mercy all my days
Shall surely follow me:
And in the house of God always,
My dwelling place shall be.
Lord all thy works do speak thy praise,
And thee thy Saints shall bless,
They shall proclaim thy Kingdoms fame,
And thy great power express.
Thy Kingdom everlasting is,
Its glory has no end,
And thine alone Dominion
Through Ages does extend.
Glory to the Eternal God,
In his transcendent place;
Let peace on Earth make her abode,
Let men receive his Grace.
The Elders and the blessed Saints,
Who do thy Throne surround,
Do never cease by night or day
These praises to resound.
The Song of Moses and the Lamb,
They sing with one accord.
Great are thy works and mavelous,
Almighty God our Lord.
Just are thy ways thou King of Saints,
And true is all thy word;
Who would not fear and glorify
Thy holy name, O Lord?
The Lamb is worthy, that was slain,
Of Power and Renown,
Of Wisdom, Honor, and to wear
The Royal Glorious Crown.
For thou our Souls redeemed have,
By thy most precious Blood,
And made us Kings and Sacred Priests
To the Eternal God.
Let the exalted Heavens rejoice,
And let the Earth be glad:
The Sea with its applauding noise,
Triumphant praise shall add.
O bless the Lord, all ye his Hosts,
And Ministers of his,
And all his works throughout all Coasts
Where his Dominion is.
Bless thou the Lord my Soul, my mouth
His praises shall proclaim;
Bless him all flesh, all that has breath,
Praise ye the Lord's great name;
To Father Son and Holy Ghost,
All Glory be therefore:
As our Baptism does oblige
Both now and evermore.
A small Collection from Mr. Burgess.
Heaven's King my careful Shepherd is,
I am his Pasture Sheep.
'Twere strange if I should come to want,
For he does never sleep,
His Word and Ordinances are
Fat Pastures unto me,
In them he leads me where the streams
Of Grace and Peace run free.
Surely thy goodness and free grace
Shall reach me all my days,
And let my life be long or short,
I Will spend it in thy praise.
Blessing and Glory and Renown,
Then give we altogether,
To him that on the Throne sets down,
And to the Lamb for ever:
Hymn VI. for the Sabbath.
D. B.
COme let us set to Angels work,
Yea Lord, I Will sing thy praise;
I will proclaim thy wondrous Grace,
Thy Honor we will raise.
Thanksgiving is a heavenly work,
It Is all in Heaven they do,
To thank and praise the Lord most high,
On Earth it is sweet work too.
Let all the World shout at the Just,
God will be their high Tower,
And such a Fort, that all the World
Shall never one Saint devour.
Of silly babes and sucklings weak,
Thou make the Church so strong,
That it confounds the Gates of Hell
That seek to do it wrong.
My Thoughts are much too big for words,
When to thy Heavens I look,
And view the Moon and Stars most high,
Thy glorious lovely book.
Then bless my Soul and all my powers,
Bless ye Jehovahs name,
As ye were born to do, the Saints
Do always praise the same;
Through Christ he pardons all our sins,
And blots out our misdeeds,
He heals our outward maladies,
And supplies all our needs.
He has the Keys of Hell and Death.
The Souls of men to save,
He in his kindness bore the Cross,
That we the Crown might have.
Bless, bless my Soul, that Lord and God,
Whose benefits engage,
His benefits of every hour
Who can count in an Age?
For this his loving kindnesses,
He Is sooner reconciled,
Than any tender Father is
To his Repenting Child,
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost, etc.
For the Sabbath.
O Blessed are ye Saints above,
How active is your state?
You ever bless the Lord your God,
Not at our broken Rate.
They never pray but always praise,
They endless Sabbaths keep*
They never shut their Eyes or Mouths,
Their rest is free from sleep.
But oh how weak are crawling Worms,
How short's our Sabbath days?
We dye more hours by far in sleep,
Than we do live in praise.
O Glorious God accept our Wills,
And Weaknesses forgive,
We wish our Souls were like the Saints,
Unlike them as we live.
They all were once as weak as we,
Lord grant (we be not long,)
That we may be as strong as they,
And sing their heavenly song.
lord what is life without thy love,
It Is but a sorry thing,
What makes the Court of Heaven above?
Thy Presence it is great King.
(...) do not envy great men's state,
Nor pine to see their store,
Take they the World, give me thy Love,
I Am Rich, and they are Poor.
Hymn VII. Another for the Sabbath day.
O God whose glorious Majesty,
We can so little praise,
^Tis but a few and weary hours,
And those the best of days.
Heaven be the land of praise,
Lord why must we keep thence?
What folly is it that makes us loath
To dye and to go hence?
^each down, Reach down thine arm of Grace,
Lord fit us to ascend,
Where Congregations near brake up,
And Sabbaths have no end.
^here, there is no sleep nor weariness
To break thy Servants peace,
^or envious thoughts nor slanderous Tongues,
Their troubles to increase.
There, there is no falt, but all is free,
There day lives without night,
There Men and Angels live by love,
And in thy lovely light.
I come, I come my God to thee,
Thanks Lord to thee I come,
My wearied starved prodigal Soul,
Come Soul, come gladly home.
World take thy husks and give thy Swine,
I am for better bread,
For all my Fathers Children be
With Heavenly Manna fed,
Now flesh leave Tempting of me now,
To dote on sensual things,
They that thy Feasts do value much,
They know not Christ the King.
Too long, too long my simple Soul
A bond-slave thou have been,
This day I join thee to thy God,
And thee Divorce from Sin.
My dearest Lord and my poor Soul
For ever, ever Love,
According to his Covenant seal
In this World and above.
Hymn VIII. Another for the Sabbath or Lords D^
MY Lord, my Love was Crucified,
He all the pains did bear,
But in the sweetness of his rest,
He makes his Servants share.
^w sweetly rest thy Saints above,
Which in thy Bosom lie;
^y Church below does rest in hope
Of that felicity.
^ou, Lord, who daily feed'st thy Sheep,
Make them a weekly Feast.
^y Flocks meet in their several Folds
Upon this day of Rest.
^elcome and dear unto my Soul
^re these sweet feasts of Love;
(...) what a Sabbath shall I keep,
When I shall Rest above?
^ess thy wise and wondrous love,
Which bind us to be free;
^ich makes us leave our Earthly snares,
That we may come to thee.
^me, I wait, I hear, I pray,
Thy footsteps, Lord, I trace;
^ng to think this is the way,
Unto my Saviors Face.
^is market day does Saints enrich,
And smiles upon them all,
^s their Pentecost, on which
The Holy Ghost does fall.
^ay of Wonders! Mercies Pawn,
The weary Souls recruit,
^e Christians Goshen, Heavens Dawn,
The end of endless fruit.
Hymn X. As the 100 Psalm.
THou spread'st a weekly Table, Lord,
Where Souls may banquet on thy Wor^
Whilst means in plenty we enjoy,
Let not our Souls be parcht and dry.
We wait here at Bethesda's Pool,
Those Waters which refresh and cool,
We wait whose Souls are scorcht with sin;
O come, dear Savior, help us in.
Thy Power and thy Grace display,
Be thou amongst us on thy day,
That sinners may observe thy call,
And numerous converts to the fall,
That those who do thy footsteeps trace,
May find all sweetness in thy Grace.
O may they never more complain
That they have sought their good in vain.
Thy People at thy Footstool lie,
Behold us with a gracious Eye,
O let our Souls with Jesus meet,
Our fellowship with him be sweet.
Among thy people here am I,
Lord let me not be passed by,
Let this poor Soul with triumph say,
I Have seen my dearest Lord to day.
I sit within thy Temple shade,
O let thy presence make me glad,
Love me, my Lord, or else I die,
Thy Love alone can satisfy.
Hymm XI. For Communion with God.
^Las! my God, that we should be
Such strangers to each other:
that as Friends we might agree,
And walk and talk together!
^ou know my Soul does dearly love
The place of thine abode;
(...) Music gives so sweet a sound,
As these two words, My God.
^ong not for the fruit that grows
Within these Gardens here;
and no sweetness in the Rose,
When Jesus is not near.
^y gracious presence, O my Christ!
Can make a Paradise;
(...) what are all the goodly Pearls
Unto this Pearl of price!
^y I taste that Communion, Lord,
Thy People have with thee?
^y Spirit daily talks with them,
O let it talk with me!
^ke Enoch, let me walk with God,
And thus walk out my day,
^tended with the heavenly Guards,
Upon my King's Highway.
^hen will thou come unto me, Lord?
O come, my Lord, most dear!
^me near, come nearer, nearer still;
I Am well when thou art near.
^hen will thou come unto me Lord?
I languish for thy sight;
Ten thousand Suns, if thou art strange,
Are shades instead of light.
When will thou come unto me, Lord?
For till thou do appear,
I count each moment for a day,
Each minute for a year.
Come Lord, and never from me go;
This World's a darksome place;
I find no pleasure here below,
When thou do vail thy face.
There Is no such thing as pleasure here;
My Jesus is my all;
As thou do shine, or disappear,
My pleasures rise or fall.
Come, spread thy savor on my frame,
No sweetness is so sweet;
Till I get up to praise thy Name,
Where all thy singers meet.
Hymn XII. A Cry before the Sacrament*
TO day the Lord of Hosts invites
Unto a costly Feast;
O what a privilege is this,
To be The Almighty's Guest!
I am invited, I must go,
Lord help me to prepare,
That so I may be welcome, and
Partake of Childrens fare.
All they that sit down with him must
Be decked with his Grace;
He smiles on such Communicants,
And they behold his Face.
^ut who, and what am I? O Lord!
Unholy and unmeet,
^o come within thy doors, or to
Wash thy Disciples feet.
Come Holy Spirit, come and take
My filthy Garments hence,
^he guilt, the stain, the love of sin,
Will give my Lord offense.
^emember not my sins, O Lord!
Which ever load my mind.
Thy Son did die, for such as I,
That I might mercy find.
Worldly distractions stay behind,
Below the Mount abide;
Be no disturbance to my mind,
Nor make my Savior chide.
Let nothing that is not divine,
Within thy presence move,
What e're would cause thee not to shine,
In tokens of thy Love.
Whilst thou do at thy Table sit,
Send out thy Spirit to breathe
Upon my Soul, to summon forth
My Graces from beneath.
A wake Repentance, Faith and Love,
Awake, O every Grace!
Come, come attend this glorious King,
And bow before his face.
O come, my Lord, the time draws nigh
That I am to receive,
Stand with my Pardon sealed by,
Persuade me to believe:
Let not my Jesus now be strange,
Nor hide himself from me;
O cause thy Face to shine upon
The Soul that longs for thee!
O let our Entertainment now
Be so exceeding sweet!
That we may long to come again,
And at thy Table meet.
Hymn XIII. Against Unbelief.
A Soul that is burdened with the weight
Of Sin, that on him lies,
Must go to Golgotha, then ask
For whom that Savior dies.
Surely for Sinners, such as I,
That precious blood was spilt;
Come, poor defiled Souls, O come,
And wash away your guilt!
Christ calls, arise, and do not fear,
Though thou wast Satan's Slave;
Let this thy drooping Spirit cheer,
His Errand was to save.
Christ did appear to Magdalen,
When blinded with her Tears,
To lead on others to believe,
And cast away their fears.
My sins are grown so high, that they
Deserve a second Flood;
Behold the Deluge, Christ is come
To drown them in his Blood.
My work is to believe on him,
By Faith his Blood apply,
When Faith takes out the fiery sting,
That sinner shall not die:
Lord give me this believing heart,
Advance it more and more,
Rebuke these doubts and scruples, that
Are crouding at my door.
lord, Satan says my sins are high
And spread before thy face,
^ast heighths indeed, but what are these
Unto the heighths of Grace?
Hymn XIV. A Song of Praise for the Lords Supper.
O Praise the Lord, Praise him, Praise him,
Sing Praises to his name;
^ all ye Saints of Heaven and Earth,
Extol and Laud the same.
^ho spared not his only Son,
But gave him for us all,
and made him drink the Cup of wrath,
The Wormwood and the Gall.
^ail nature shrunk, and did request
That bitter Cup might pass,
^t he must drink it off, and this
The Fathers pleasure was.
(...) then I come to do thy Will,
His blessed Son replied,
^elding himself to God and Man,
He stretched his arms and died.
(...) died indeed but rose again,
And did ascend on high,
That we poor Sinners lost and dead
Might live eternally.
Good Lord, how many Souls in Hell,
Does vengeance vex and tear,
Were it not for a dying Christ,
Our dwelling had been there:
His blood was shed instead of ours,
His Soul our Hell did bear,
He took our sin, gave us himself,
What an exchange is here?
What ever is not Hell it self,
For me it is too good;
But must we eat the Flesh of Christ,
And must we drink his Blood?
His Flesh is Heavenly Food indeed,
His Blood is Drink Divine,
His Graces drop like Honey*falls,
His comforts taste like Wine.
Sweet Christ, thou have refreshed our Souls
With thine abundant Grace,
For which we magnify thy name,
Longing to see thy Face.
When shall our Souls mount up to thee,
Most Holy, Just, and True,
To eat that Bread and drink that Wine
Which is for ever new?
Hymn XV. The Sinners admiration of Divi^ Mercy, as 148. Psalm
WHO can this love express?
His Mercy never decays,
that can my Soul do less?
^han love him all my days.
Bless God my Soul,
^'n unto Death,
^ffering praise
With every Breath.
^y sins were very high,
^his Soul almost in Hell,
^et Jesus then drew nigh
and caught me as I fell.
Bless God my Soul
^ven unto Death
^flamed Love
In every Breath.
^ejected Souls may not
^cceptance with him fear,
^o sigh was e're forgot,
^e Botltes every Tear:
Do not despair,
because you see,
^ow kind the Lord
Has been to me.
^ere Lord will I admire
^he wonders of thy Grace,
^ill thou shall call me higher,
^here to behold thy face:
O height of Grace!
Depth of Love!
^ow fit me for
Thy joys above.
^o praise Redeeming Love,
^y Soul does now rejoice;
Come thou assisting Dove,
Thou know it is my choice.
My Heart so low,
Lord, thou can raise,
Blessed Spirit blow,
And I shall praise.
Glory to God on high,
And peace to men below,
Now Christ in Grace is nigh
His Spirit to bestow.
All Glory then
To the Father, too
The Son also
And Spirit. Amen.
Hymn XVI. The Conflict.
O What a War is in my Soul,
Which fain would be devout?
Exceeding weary of this fight,
But dare not yet give out;
The Flesh and Spirit both contend
For this weak Soul of mine,
That often I know not what to do,
But Lord I would be thine.
I would believe, but unbelief
Prevails the other way;
And I have constant cause of grief,
A longer Night than Day.
I cry to God, these cries declare
Whose part my Soul does take,
Accept my poor desires, whilst I
Do this resistance make.
The Law of Sin Grace will Jar,
Both dwelling in one Room,
My Soul expects perpetual War,
Till I am sent for home.
Although these combats make me fear,
They shall not cast me down,
God will give Grace to hold out here,
And Glory for my Crown.
My restless Soul shall never give over
Until thy Bowels move,
I Will not be driven, Lord, from thy Door
Till thou shall say I Love.
Hymn XVII. A Song of Praise for the Hope of Glory.
I Sojourn in a Vail of Tears,
Alas! how can I sing,
My Harp does on the Willows hang,
Distun'd in every string,
My Music is a Captives Chain,
Harsh sounds my Ears do fill;
How shall I sing sweet Sions Song,
On this side Sions Hill?
Yet lo I hear a joyful sound,
Surely I quickly come,
Each word much sweetness does distill,
Like a full Honey comb.
And do thou come my dearest Lord?
And do thou surely come?
And do thou surely quickly come?
Methinks I am at home.
Come then my dearest, dearest Lord,
My sweetest, surest friend;
Come, for I Loath these Kedar Tents,
Thy fiery Chariots send.
What have I here? my thoughts and joys
Are all packed up and gone,
My eager Soul would follow them
To thine Eternal Throne.
What have I in this barren Land?
My Jesus is not here.
Mine Eyes will never be blessed until
My Jesus does appear.
My Jesus is gone up to Heaven
To get a place for me;
For it is his will that where he is,
There should his servants be.
Canaan I view from Pisgah's top;
Of Canaans Grapes I taste.
My Lord who sends unto me here,
Will send for me at last.
I have a God that changes not,
Why should I be perplexed?
My God that owns me in this World,
Will Crown me in the next.
Go fearless then, my Soul, with God,
Into another Room.
Thou who have long walked with him here,
Go see thy God at home.
View Death with a Believing Eye,
It has an Angels Face;
And this kind Angel will prefer
Thee to an Angels place.
The Grave is but a fining pot
Unto believing Eyes:
For there the Flesh shall lose its dross,
And like the Sun shall rise.
The World, which I have loved so well,
Has mocked me with its Lies,
How gladly could I leave behind
These vexing vanities?
My dearest friends all dwell above,
Them will I go to see,
And all my friends in Christ below
Will soon come after me,
Fear not the Trumps, Earths rending sound,
Dread not the Day of Doom.
For he that is to be thy Judge,
Thy Savior is become.
Blessed be my God that gives me light,
Who in the dark did grope.
Blessed be my God, the God of love,
Who causes me to hope,
Here the word, Signet, Comforts Staff,
And here is Graces Chain.
By these thy Pledges, Lord, I know
My hopes are not in vain.
Hymn XVIII. Psalm as 148. Gods Mercy the Ground of Man's praise.
Part I.
O Celebrate the Lord,
And with a grateful mind,
His benefits record,
He Is ever good and kind.
His Glorious Grace,
And Mercy shines
Beyond the lines
Of time and place.
II.
O let his Israel
His Glories bright display,
This, this becomes them well
To praise their God, and say,
His glorious Grace
And Mercy shines
Beyond the lines
Of Time and Place.
III.
A Song of Praise prepare,
This work belongs to you,
Of Aarons house that are,
And Gods Domestics too,
His glorious Grace
And Mercy shines
Beyond the lines
Of time and place.
IV.
All ye that fear the Lord,
All that his Laws obey,
Praise him with one accord,
Extol his name and say,
His glorious Grace
And Mercy shines
Beyond the lines
Of time and place.
Part II. Praise for Protection.
I.
O, that I may record
The kindness I have felt,
Did call upon the Lord
When my sad Heart did melt
With Anxious fear,
To my request
When thus addressed,
He bowed his Ear.
II.
How soon my fear was fled,
He having heard my voice,
Me out of trouble led,
Into a Paradise,
There I enjoy
By him discharged,
By him enlarged
Sweet liberty.
III.
The mighty Lord of Hosts
As chief is on my side,
I Will not regard their boasts,
Who do my trust deride;
When God's my friend,
Alas how can
Poor feeble man
With me contend?
IV.
The Lord does take my part
With those that for me fight
My foes shall backward start,
All vanquished by his might,
In God to trust
Is better than
In Mortal Men,
Who are but dust.
V.
Though Princes great in might
Great Armies do command,
They safety seek by flight,
And fall by a strong hand.
In God to trust
Is better than
In Mighty Men,
That are but dust.
VI.
To th'Father and the Son,
And Holy Ghost now be,
All Glory unto one
True God, and Persons Three.
As 'twas for when
Times measure ends
His praise transcends
All time, Amen.
VII.
Glory to God on high,
And peace to men below.
Now God in Grace is nigh
All blessings to bestow,
All glory then
To th'Father, to
The Son also,
And Sp'rit. Amen.
Hymn IX. As Psalm 33.
JUstice and Judgment he does love,
His Goodness fills all coasts,
God by his word made Heaven above
By's Spirit formed all their Hosts.
The Seas he in their Channels keeps,
Their heaps the Bellows cured,
In storehouses he lays the deeps,
O fear him all the World.
In awe of him let all men stand
That dwell from Sun to Sun.
His work's confirm his high command,
He spoke and it was done.
The Counsel which the Heathen take
The Lord does bring to naught,
And men's devices vain does make,
They no effect have wrought.
The Counsel of the Lord stands sure,
And so for ever shall.
The intentions of his Heart endure
To Generations all.
That Nation's blessed whose Gods the Lord,
That people's blessed whom he
Has chosen of his own accord
His heritage to be.
Hymn XX. 2. Psalm.
WHY do the Heathen rage and fret.
Till vain inventions tire,
The Kings on Earth themselves do set
And Rulers do conspire.
His gentle Government they count
Their Yoke, his Laws their Chain,
Freedom they will have without control,
No bands shall them restrain.
But God above will scorn their rage,
Their vain attempts deride,
His Power shall vex them, and his Wrath
Vex their defeated Pride.
Then shall his voice in Thunder ring,
His wrath on them shall fall;
His fury thus insenc'd shall bring
Vexation on them all.
For all their spite Iv'e set my King
Securely on his Throne:
And, what I had decreed before,
Proclaimed him now my Son.
This is the birthday of thy Rule,
Thy Scepter I Will advance
Over all the Earth; the Gentiles give
For thine Inheritance.
And thou shall break their power and strength
As with an Iron Rod:
As Potsherds vile shall they at length
Under thy foot be trod.
Be wise now therefore all ye Kings,
Ye Judges of the Land,
Be ye instructed in the things
Ye ought to understand.
Serve ye the Lord with holy fear,
With trembling awe rejoice,
O Kiss the Sun lest that ye hear
His angry threatening voice;
So should you perish from the way
His anger thus expressed,
When Is wrath is Kindled once; O they
That trust in him are blessed!
Hymn XXI. Mr. J. G 's Hymn for the Sacrament.
ROuse up you dearly purchased Souls,
To praise the Lord above,
And with affections true and large,
Speak of his Grace and Love.
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
By one consenting will,
Declared for ransoming lost Souls,
That Christ his blood should spill;
All with provision in the way
Unto the Holy Land,
They are prepared by our dear Lord,
And brought us by his hand.
How sweet it is to banquet here,
Let feasted Souls declare,
How good to feed at such a feast
Where such rich dainties are.
But what we do enjoy on Earth,
Are but the crumbs that fall;
When Christ shall take us to himself,
We shall enjoy our all.
How long dear Lord? how long will thou
Delay to take us up.
Our absent Souls do wait in pain,
With thee above to sup.
The Heavens a blessed song shall sing
To Angel's God and ours,
When all the Saints shall enter in
With most enlarged powers.
Hymn XXII. For the Sacrament.
CHrist did contract with God,
Before the World began,
To save from Sin, from Hell and Death
In time distressed man.
Gods Justice was most strict,
The Debt must be paid down,
But man by sin Gods Image lost,
Which was his Strength and Crown.
Take up the Sword and slay
This Enemy of mine,
Did Justice say when 'twas enraged,
But Christ stepped up in time;
O Justice stop thy hand,
Our Savior kindly spoke,
And if thou must have recompense
Man's Debt I Will undertake.
Come sheathe thy Sword in me,
Let man not be undone,
For now to suffer in his room,
A man I will become.
And what thou do demand,
I Will fully satisfy.
If nothing else will purchase life,
I am content to dye.
Ye Angels of the Lord,
Ye Saints that are above,
And all Redeemed Souls on Earth,
Praise ye this God of Love.
XXIV. Sacramental Hymns.
LET those life-breathing lips of thine
Be joined, O Christ, to me!
Because thy Love excels Wine,
And all thy Saints love thee.
With Flagons of refreshing Joy,
And Comforts from above,
Stay me, O stay me powerfully,
For I am sick of Love!
Beneath his shadow I was placed,
With very great content:
His fruit was sweet unto my taste,
(His Word and Sacrament.)
O draw me! my dear Savior,
With those strong Cords of Love,
And then shall we go after thee
As fast as we can move.
Herein is Love, not ours to God,
But his to us most large;
In sending down his only Son,
Our great Debts to discharge.
He saved us from the Wrath to come,
At that most dreadful day;
And was so good to shed his blood,
To wash our sins away.
Even Jesus Christ, who saved us all
From storms of future wrath:
Whose love to wash our sins away,
Made his own blood the Bath.
To him that on the Throne sets down,
And Christ the Lamb, therefore,
Be Blessing, Glory and Renown,
And Power for evermore.
Another.
HOsanna to King David's Son,
Hosanna to the Christ,
That in the Almighty's name does come,
Hosanna in the highest.
For thou were slain, and art alive,
Redeeming us to God,
From every Nation, Kingdom, Tongue,
By thy most precious Blood.
Corruptive things as silver is,
And Gold Redeemed us not:
But the dear blood of Christ our Lord,
A Lamb without a spot.
My Savior dear, my beloved one
Is mine, and I am his:
Chief of ten thousand, he is alone,
My highest Joy and Bliss.
H'was Sin us for that knew no sin,
That so we might be made,
The Righteousness of God in him,
By whom the price was paid.
And being thus made free from sin,
God's service to attend,
The fruit to Holiness shall be,
Eternal Life the end.
By his own Will and Word has he,
Wrought our Regeneration;
A kind of first ripe fruits to be,
Of all the whole Creation.
Now to the true eternal King,
Not seen with mortal Eye;
The immortal only wise true God,
Be Praise perpetually.
Hymn XXVI. As the 100. Psalm.
THe Lord does reign, and like a King,
Puts on his robes of glorious light;
Tremble thou Earth, when he appears,
Clothed and girt about with might.
Under his rule, the unquiet World,
Will gain stability and Peace;
Of old his Empire did begin,
And like himself, can never cease.
In vain the World rebellious powers,
In tumults and commotions rise,
Like troubled waters of the Sea,
That bid defiance to the Skies.
Resist not his unequal strength,
That Is far above your threatening noise;
For even the Seas unruly Waves,
Do calmly listen to his voice.
Lord as thy Power can never fail,
So all thy Promises are sure.
It Is thy perfection to be true,
And those that serve thee to be pure.
Hymn XXV. As the 148. Psalm:
YE servants of the Lord
1. That Heaven and Earth did frame;
Who on his Service wait,
Praise ye his glorious name.
His goodness does
To this invite;
His praise will give
The best delight.
In him all Glories meet;
His greatness knows no bound;
2. What other Gods do claim,
In him is only found.
Who as at first,
He all things made,
Still rules over all,
By all obeyed.
All things in Heaven above,
3. Are Subject to his Will;
The Earth and Seas below
His pleasure do fulfill.
At his Command
From the Worlds end,
Thick Vapors come,
The Clouds ascend.
Lightnings from thence burst out,
And Rains are fast poured down;
4. He brings his boyst'rous winds
From Treasuries unknown.
Thy name and thy
Memorial,
For ever Lord
Continue shall.
Hymn XXVIII. As 148. Psalm.
GIVE thanks unto the Lord,
That is so kind and good;
5. Whose mercies firmly last,
As they have ever stood.
To this Great King,
All things do bow,
Angels above,
And powers below.
His works our wonder raise;
The Heavens his Wisdom made;
6. And he the out stretched Earth
Above the Waters laid.
He made the Sun
The Days great light,
The Moon and Stars
To rule the Night.
Egypt's firstborn he smote
And by his powerful hand,
7. He brake off Israel's Yoke,
And brought them from that Land:
His mercies shown
To Ages past,
Eternally
Shall spring and last.
The parted Sea made way
For Israel to pass;
8. There the pursuing Host
Of Pharaoh drowned was.
His People through
The Desert led,
By Miracles
Were daily fed.
Kings that opposed their way,
Sihon and Og he smote;
9. And made their fruitful Land
Fall to his Peoples Lot.
His mercies shown
To ages past
Eternally
Shall spring and last.
Hymn XXX. as 119. Psalm in its proper tune.
Blessed is the man, whose blameless life
The Law of God directs;
Who keeps his precepts, and whose heart
To serve the Lord affects.
They never wilfully transgress,
Who to these paths repair;
Thou Lord have charged us to keep
All thy commands with care.
O by thy Grace so guide my ways,
Never from thine to swerve;
Nothing shall shame my confidence,
Whilst I thy laws observe.
I Will praise thee better, when I Am more
Instructed in thy fear;
To serve thee I resolve: O give
Me Graces to persevere.
But how shall Youth, so prone to Vice,
Govern their manners, Lord;
By heedful listening to the Wise,
Directions of thy Word?
Sincerely I have begged thy Grace,
O keep me close to thee:
I Have treasured up thy Word, that I
Might not a Sinner be.
I Have chose thy Truths to be my guide,
Thy Law my Rule have made:
I Will run the way of thy Commands,
Since thou have made me glad.
Lord, give me a discerning mind,
And Knowledge of thy will;
Then what thy sacred Law enjoins,
I Will heartily fulfill.
Incline my Heart to thy Commands,
Whilst others Riches prize;
From the vain pleasures of the world,
Lord turn away mine Eyes.
Thou art my Portion, and thy word,
I count to be most dear;
Thy promised Mercy and thy Love,
Before this world prefer.
My former wand'rings I reviewed,
And then without delay;
Resolved to change my course, and turn
Into thy safer way.
Thy hands have made and fashioned me,
With wisdom me endue,
And by the knowledge of thy Laws,
Lord form my Soul anew.
I know thy Judgments righteous are,
And all my troubles just;
Lord let thy Mercy comfort me,
For in thy Word I trust.
For ever, like the Heavens, Lord,
Thy Word is settled fast;
As firmly as the Earth, thy Truth
Does to all Ages last.
These all in their appointed course
Continue to this day;
And all like ready Servants stand,
Thine Orders to obey.
Had not thy Truth been my support,
Thy Law been my delight,
Under the pressure of my woes,
I Would sunk and perished quite.
Of all Perfection here below,
I soon discern an end;
But thy large Precepts to all times
And states of Life extend.
O how I love thy Law! it is
My daily exercise;
This study makes me wiser far,
Than all mine Enemies.
Honey no sweetness does afford,
Like what thy words create;
From thence I learn the flatter'ng sweets,
Of every sin to hate.
Thy Word is to my Life a Guide,
Unto my Paths a Light;
I Have sworn to keep thy righteous Laws,
Which I Will perform aright.
O let thy dealings toward me,
And mercy be the same,
Thou usest to express to those
That love and fear thy Name.
Order my goings in thy Word,
And my Director be;
Then no iniquity shall gain
Dominion over me.
I see how Sinners break thy Laws,
By bold Impieties;
This makes me sadly to lament,
And Tears overflow mine Eyes.
Thy Nature, Lord, and thy Commands
Exactly do agree;
Holy, and just, and true thou art,
And such thy Precepts be.
Thy Word from all impurer dross
Refined, is my delight;
On this I meditate before
The Watches of the night.
Those men are crowned with inward Peace,
Who thy Commandments love;
And no temptations unto sin
To them a scandal prove.
My Soul does all thy Precepts keep,
And Testimonies prize;
For all my Actions naked are,
To thine all-seeing Eyes.
Like a lost Sheep, I Have gone astray,
But now to thee I come;
Thy precepts I resolve to obey,
Lord bring thy Servant home:
Hymn XXXI, As the 100 Psalm.
NOt unto us, Lord not to us,
But to thy Name the Praise we owe;
To thy free goodness and thy truth,
The springs whence all our Blessings flow.
Why should the Heathen ask in scorn,
Where is the God whom you adore;
In Heaven he reigns, but does on Earth,
What e're his Will ordained before.
Silver and Gold their Idols are,
And all their worth derive from thence;
With no Divinity inspired,
Since they are void of Life or Sense.
For though the Maker forms an Eye,
A Mouth or any other part;
He cannot give them sight or breath,
Nor lively motion by his Art.
Fond Men, to think your Hands can make
A God, to which our knee should bow,
You trust what cannot help it self,
Statues have Sense as much as you.
The silent Grave cannot declare
Thy wonders, nor proclaim thy praise;
We'll now begin that Blessed work,
Which shall continue all our days.
110 Psalm, as 100.
THus spoke the Lord unto his Son,
Sit thou advanced at my Right Hand;
Till all thy conquered Foes shall crouch,
And wait their doom from thy Command.
From Sion shall thy Word go forth,
Which like a Scepter thou shall sway;
To bring the stubborn under rule,
And make them willingly obey.
Thy Conquest shall be great that day,
The numerous Converts thou shall view;
Shall make an Army that exceeds,
The Crystal drops of morning dew.
The Lord has all his Truth engaged
By Oath, which he can never break;
To make thee an Eternal Priest,
Of the Order of Melchizedeck.
And when he is raised to his Throne.
Proud Monarchs that oppose his Reign,
Shall fall, and all the wicked World,
That will not stoop to him, be slain.
While he pursues this Work, he will stoop,
To mean refreshments in the way;
But with a glorious reward,
God will his sufferings repay.
103 Psalm, as 100.
BLess thou the Lord, my Soul, his Name,
Let all the Powers within me Bless;
O Let not his past favors lie
Forgotten in unthankfulness.
It Is he that pardons all thy sins,
He that in sickness makes thee sound:
It Is he redeemed from the Grave,
Thy Life with love and mercy crowned.
It Is he that fills thy Mouth with good,
And all thy just desires supplies:
Who, like the Eagles, makes thine Age
To a renewed youth arise.
From his strict Justice sure relief
Oppressed Innocence shall find;
Moses and Israel knew his ways,
And the inclinations of his mind.
Abundant Mercies flow from God;
Love is his nature and delight;
Slow is his wrath, and though he chides,
Intends not to destroy us quite.
Man's Days are like the Grass or Flower
That in the Field its beauty shows;
But fades with every blasting Wind,
And then its former place none knows.
But Gods eternal Truth and Love,
Is to good men and to their Race:
Those that his Laws, and Covenant keep,
His favor ever will embrace.
Circled with glorious light, his Throne
The Lord has placed in Heaven above;
Whose mighty Power and sovereign Rule,
Extends over all that live and move.
Bless God ye Angels who in strength
And ready services transcend;
Bless him ye Hosts and Ministers,
Who all to do his Will attend.
Let all his Works through all the World
To praise their glorious Lord accord;
And O my Soul bear thou thy part,
And ever bless and praise the Lord.
104 Psalm As the (100)
MY Soul forever bless the Lord;
To this his greatness does invite;
Honor and Majesty's his Robe,
His beauteous Vesture's splendid light.
He as a Tent the Heaven extends,
Whose Rooms on liquid Waters stay;
Clouds are his Chariot, and the Winds
With their winged Wheels meet out his way.
Angels as swift as air, as bright
As flames with quick obedience move;
To publish and effect below,
His Pleasure given in charge above.
The Earth's foundations are unknown,
No Pillars raised its weight to bear;
And yet no power can make it move
Though it hangs loose in flued Air.
Part II.
He from the Hills through secret veins,
Causes the Crystal Springs to burst,
They glide through Valleys, where the Beasts,
And the Wild Asses quench their thirst.
Their Birds are taught with curious Art
Their Nests in shady Boughs to raise;
And by their cheerful notes reprove
Our silence in our Makers praise.
Nor can the higher grounds, which gape
For thirst, complain that they are forgot:
Clouds big with showers on them distill,
And Water every barren plat.
Great God, how various are thy works,
Created all with wondrous skill!
Thy Blessings, Lord, enrich the Earth,
And the Seas spacious bosom fill.
If God but in displeasure frown,
The whole Creation needs must Mourn;
If he withholds his Breath or theirs:
They dye and to their dust return.
The great employment of my life
Shall be to praise the mighty Lord;
To think upon his love and works,
The sweetest pleasure will afford.
Dr. W.
95. Psalm.
COme let us with united joys
To God our voices raise:
With thankful hearts before him come,
And loudly sing his praise.
Our Lord is a great God and King,
In powers eminent
Above all Gods, him Angels serve,
And Princes represent.
The secrets of the Earth, and strength
Of Hills are in his Hand;
He made the Waters of the Sea,
And for their bounds dry Land,
To him that made us let us kneel,
And Adorations give,
Who are his People, and the Sheep
That on his Pastures live.
To day let us hear his voice, and not
Such hardened Sinners prove,
As those that in the Wilderness
Provoked God above.
They proved his Power, and saw his Works,
And grieved him forty year;
Till, wearied with that murmuring race,
He could no longer bear.
He did their unbelief, and base
Ingratitude detest;
And in his anger swear they should
Not come into his Rest.
Coll. 71. Psalm as the 25.
MY Soul on God relys.
Let none disgrace my trust;
Lord hear and save me when I call,
As thou art good and just.
Be thou my sure defense,
Whereto I may resort;
Make good thy gracious promise, Lord,
Be thou my Rock and Fort.
Lord, when my strength decays,
And when my years decline,
Do not forsake or cast me off,
But own me still as thine.
To no supports I Will fly,
But to thy strength Divine;
No other goodness shall be named,
Or faithfulness but thine.
These from my youth I Have learnt;
And hitherto declared
Thy Wondrous works, forsake me not
Now when I am Grey-hair'd.
Thou shall again revive,
My Soul, with grief deprest;
Thou, Lord, wilt raise my low estate,
Comfort and give me rest.
My cheerful Tongue and Lips,
Shall loudly bear a part,
In praising thee, when tuned and raised
By a most thankful heart.
This shall be my great work,
To celebrate thy fame;
Who Will me Redeem, and bring also
My Enemies to shame.
63 Psalm.
EArly, O Lord, my fainting Soul
Thy Mercy does implore;
No Traveller in desert land,
Can thirst for Waters more.
I long t'appear as I was wont,
Within thy holy place,
Thy Power and Glory to behold,
And to obtain thy Grace.
For Life it self without thy love
No relish does afford,
No other Joys can equal this,
To serve and praise the Lord.
I Will therefore make my Prayers to thee,
And bless thee whilst I live;
This like the choicest dainties, will
Both food and pleasure give.
When others sleep, my wakeful thoughts
Present thee to my mind,
And in the night, I think how good
My God has been and kind.
Since thou alone have been my help,
To thee alone I fly,
And on thy watchful Providence
With cheerfulness rely.
Dangers whilst thou art near to me,
Do threaten me in vain;
When I keep close to God, his care
And power will me sustain.
65 Psalm. As the 100.
PRaises in Sion wait for thee,
And there the vow performed shall be;
To the O God that hear Prayer,
All flesh shall cheerfully repair.
Our Sins may justly put a stop,
To all that good from thee we hope;
Thy Mercy does those fears allay,
For this will purge our sins away.
O happy they that may draw near
To thee and in thy Courts appear;
For these shall all refreshments have,
Thy house can give, or they can crave.
By thy amazing wonders, thou
Thy kindness to the good do show,
The ends of the Earth in thee confide,
And the Isles that in the Sea reside.
Thy Care prevents a threatening Dearth,
Thou visitest the thirsty Earth:
Showers to enrich her barren Womb,
From thy full springs above do come.
The Wilderness refresht with Rain,
Though parcht before, now springs again;
The little Hills new Garments wear,
And in their youthful green appear.
Flocks are the Clothing of the Plains,
The Vails are covered over with grain;
All Nature seems to shout and sing,
To welcome in the hopeful spring.
51 Psalm.
BEhold, O Lord, my sinful Soul,
To thee for Mercy flies;
Thy Mercy boundless is, blot out
all mine iniquities.
Oh! wash away my Crimes, for thou
Alone can make me clean:
I now confess my guilt amazed,
To see how vile I Have been.
I was conceived and born in Sin,
So prone to do amiss;
But Purity and Truth of Heart,
To thee most pleasing is.
Show thou art reconciled as these,
Whom Hysop sprinkles know;
They are absolved, thy Grace can wash
And make me white as Snow.
My Sins have forfeited the joys
And peace that once I had;
Thy voice would heal my broken bones,
Thy pardon make me glad.
Create in me, O Lord, a Heart
Unspotted in thy sight,
Renew in me a mind unmoved
from goodness, and upright.
Lord do not cast me from thy sight,
As one thou can not love;
Nor let thy Spir't though grieved so much,
Its Grace from me remove.
My opened lips shall sing thy praise,
For this thou do desire
Rather than Sacrifice of Beasts,
Consumed in the Fire.
Thou do a broken contrite heart,
More than all offerings prise,
This present now I humbly bring,
Which God will not despise.
42. Psalm and part of 43. as 100.
O God the spring of all my joys,
For thee I long, to thee I look;
No chased Heart does pant so much
After the cooling Water-brook.
Less grief it is to be exiled,
From mine own house, than, Lord, from thine;
O how I wish t'approach that place,
Where all thy glories use to shine.
Why should I cherish these sad thoughts,
Whence naught but perturbation flows?
Since they procure not what I wish,
Why should they hinder my repose?
I Have learnt this remedy at last,
To keep my passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And resignation to his Will.
43.
Thou Righteous Judge of all the World;
Be thou my gracious Advocate;
And clear mine Innocence from those
Whose craft is equal to their hate.
Thy mercy and thy truth display,
That by the conduct of thy light,
Thy Courts I may attain, and there
May have of thee a fuller sight.
T'approach thy presence would revive
My Spir't, and all my gladness raise,
Where I thy goodness would proclaim,
With Soul inlargements in thy praise.
39. Psalm as 100. for a Funeral.
LORD teach me when my latter end,
And number of my days I view;
To measure right my self and them,
How I am frail, and they are few.
My days extent is but a span,
Mine age is nothing unto thee;
Man in his flourishing estate,
Is altogether vanity.
A shadow's all that he pursues,
But his vexations Real are;
He heaps up wealth and knows not who
Shall reap the profit of his care.
Let others foolishly expect
How kind this flattering World will prove,
I Will seek my God alone to please
And be ambitious of his love.
How weak and nothing we appear,
When God for Sin does man chastise!
Like garments fretted by the Moth,
So all his beauty ruined lies.
My poor petitions, Lord, regard,
And to my mournful cry give ear;
A wandering stranger here on Earth,
I am as all my Fathers were.
Lord my decaying strength repair,
And spare me yet a while that I
May make my peace with thee, before
I go away from hence and dye.
27. Psalm as 119.
TO my Petitions Lord, return
An answer full of Grace,
Thy face thou bad'st me seek, and I
Resolve to seek thy face.
Lord do not in displeasure hide
Thy face, nor me reject;
Those succors I have had before,
From thee I still expect.
My Parents love is not so great
As thine, nor care so large;
When they forsake me, I become
Still more thy care and charge.
Lord, let me plainly see the way
Where I may safely tread;
Avoiding all the cunning snares
Mine Enemies have laid.
How wretched had I been, when I
With troubles was oppressed,
Had I not hoped thy Mercy would
Secure my peace and rest!
Wait still on God, my Soul, from him,
Courage and strength derive;
Though he delay, he will at length
Thy fainting heart revive.
25. Psalm in its proper tune.
TO God I make my Prayer,
In him my trust repose,
O let me not become a scorn
Or triumph to my Foes.
Let no events deject
Their Souls that wait on thee,
Let disappointments shame their hopes,
That deal perfidiously,
The ways, thou Lord, do choose,
Make me to know aright,
And teach me always to perform
What Is pleasing in thy sight.
From the straight paths of Truth,
Never let me go astray;
From thee, my Savior, I beg
Direction every day.
Lord, call to mind that love,
Thou did of old express;
How thou have graciously relieved
Thy Servants in distress.
Into my youthful sins
No strict enquiry make;
Those early faults, O Lord forgive,
For thine own goodness sake.
Part II.
God, who is good and just,
Will erring Souls instruct;
Their wandering steps he will to paths
Of holiness conduct.
The humble Souls he will guide,
And teach the meek his way;
Kindness and truth express to such
As his just laws obey,
Encouraged by thy Grace,
For mercy I entreat,
Pardon my sins, O Lord, that are
Both numerous and great.
Who is that happy man,
That fears the Lord above?
He Will ever lead him in the ways,
That he himself does love.
Possessed with quiet thoughts,
His Soul shall dwell at ease;
His Seed shall after him enjoy
Prosperity and Peace.
The secrets of his love,
God will make known to those
That fear him, and the blessings he
Reserves, to them disclose.
Part III.
In all my troubles Lord,
Mine Eyes are toward thee;
I hope thy goodness at the last,
From all will set me free.
Lord, turn a gracious Eye
To me, and Mercy show;
Great are the afflictions I endure,
And find no help below.
My troubles are enlarged,
Lord send me quick relief;
Grant me forgiveness of my Sins,
And then remove my grief.
Preserve and keep my Soul,
From shame as well as guilt;
O never disappoint the hopes
That I on thee have built.
Let my tried Innocence,
Find sure supports from thee;
At length thy chosen People Lord,
From all their troubles free.
46 Psalm.
THE Almighty Lord is our defense,
The strength whereby we stand;
When troubles their approaches make,
His help is nigh at hand.
Our Faith may there remain unmoved,
Though the Earth should be displaced;
Or though into the Sea's vast gulf,
The Mountains should be cast.
Although the Oceans troubled waves,
A frightful noise should make;
Should rise and swell above the Cloud,
And cause the hills to shake.
There is a quiet stream makes glad,
The City of the Lord;
His presence will secure her peace,
And timely help afford.
The Nations rage and threaten War,
But God is on our side:
One word of his dissolves their force,
And daunts their swelling pride.
See what his hand has done; it draws
The Sword out of its sheath;
And while he gives it leave, Triumphs,
In Slaughter and in Death.
Then by another Word he makes,
Destructive Wars to cease;
He breaks their Arms, the bow and spear,
And Crowns the Earth with Peace.
Cease then fond Men, to strive with God,
Whose Power is over all;
For fear lest he exalt himself,
In your unpitied Fall.
23 Psalm as the 100.
GOd is my Shepherd, who will see,
That all my wants be still supplied;
I shall not be exposed to wrong,
Nor left to stray without a guide.
The Pastures they are fresh and green,
Where I have ease and sweet repast;
The Streams are cool and quiet, where
I quench my thirst and please my taste.
His Comforts which revives my Soul,
Life's tedious journey pleasant make;
And in the peaceful ways of Grace,
He leads me for his Goodness sake.
Though I should walk where black despair
And sorrow casts a dismal shade;
Thy power and thy tender Care,
Would chase my fears, and make me glad.
Thou spread'st my Table, where my Foes
Behold thy bounty, and repine
To see rich Oils anoint my head,
And see my Cup overflow with Wine.
Surely the goodness of the Lord
Shall still surround me all my days:
I will frequent thy House, and there
Display thy Love and sing thy praise.
9. Psalm as the 100.
WITH all my Soul I Will bless the Lord,
And all his mighty works proclaim:
Gladness and joy shall fill my heart,
Whilst I sing praises to his name.
The Eternal God from Change secure,
Has placed his Throne in glorious light;
When he appears to judge the World,
His sentence will be just and right,
From him th'oppress'd will find relief,
He Will be their refuge in distress.
No good man's Faith was ever shamed,
His Prayer never wanted good success.
Arise, O Lord, and interpose,
To blast the wickeds good success,
And by thy Terrors make them feel,
They are but men, and so confess.
Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes,
When thou do kindly me chastise:
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear,
O let not that against me rise.
The Lord has heard my Prayer, and those
That gaped upon me as their Prey,
Will vex themselves at their defeat,
And with confusion turn away.
God will reward the Just man's works,
As he approves the ways they tread.
But the smooth paths of Sinners down
To Death and to Damnation lead.
Mark but the good and perfect man,
And him that is upright in his ways,
Mercy attends his happy life,
And quiet peace concludes his days.
37. Psalm as the 100.
I Have seen the wicked rise to Power,
Flourish like Laurels fresh and green;
But suddenly their ruin came,
And no remainder could be seen.
For God, whose nature's good and just,
Those that his Image have, will own,
They shall continue when the race
Of wicked men are overthrown.
In all the experience of my life,
That holy man I never could see,
Whose Alms exposed himself to want,
Or brought his race to Beggary.
The Lord directs a good man's steps,
And he delights in his way;
He is not ruined by his falls,
God's power is his support and stay.
Think not mere wealth makes happy men,
That little which contents the poor,
Is better far, than wicked men's
Ill got or ill employed store.
He Is wise that is always doing good,
And on God's goodness does rely;
Thus thy enjoyments he will secure,
And all thy just desires supply.
Leave thy concerns unto his care,
In firm dependence on him live,
He Will either grant what thou would have
Or what he knows is better give.
Though slanders and detracting tongues,
Like clouds thy righteousness obscure;
He Will clear thy innocence, the light
At noon shall not appear more pure.
J. C.
Death, or for Funerals. 5. Psalm.
DEath steals upon us unawares,
And Digs our Graves unseen,
Whilst we dispute, are full of cares,
What may be, what has been.
Shall I be bent on vanity?
And rottenness to trust,
Till Death shall lay his hand on me,
And crumble me to dust.
What if my Sun should set at Noon,
If Death should call to day?
Can thou my Soul, go off so soon,
Have thou no scores to pay?
Behold my Sands how quick they fall,
How near I am my Goal,
Let not my Body be undrest,
Till thou have clothed my Soul.
That at the Trumpet's sound I may
Spring from my dusty bed,
Rejoicing at the voice that calls.
Arise, come forth, ye dead.
O give me Faith and Patience Lord,
Upon a dying Bed,
And let my Savior then afford
Supports to heart and head.
Support my weak and tottering Faith,
If dismal fears annoy:
My Jesus be my strong defense,
My Jesus be my joy.
O Holy Ghost do thou not fail,
At this time to appear,
O let thy Spir't and Faith prevail,
My evidence to clear.
My Soul in thy sweet hands I trust,
Now can I sweetly sleep,
My Body falling to the Dust,
I leave with thee to keep.
Mr. B.
A Song of Praise at parting of Friends.
LORD, do not say I love thee not,
And thou will not me love,
Because thy Gospel Covenant Grace
Does me so little move.
It Is true, I love thee not enough,
Enough who can thee love?
Thou never can be loved enough,
No not in Heaven above.
I do not love thee as I would,
Nor as they do above,
But had I power to my Will,
I Would make my self all love.
But if indeed I love thee not,
I know not what I Love,
It Is for thy sake I love this life,
And seek the life above.
But how, I wonder, did I come,
To prize and love thee so,
That as I love thee more or less,
My comforts come or go.
O God of Love make good thy word,
Love thirsting Souls to fill,
I hope of Love I hither came,
In hope depart I will.
A Song of Praise took out of the Revelation of St. John.
TO him that loved us for himself,
And died to do us good,
And washed us from our scarlet sins,
In his most precious blood.
And made us Kings and Priests to God,
His Father infinite,
To him eternal glory be,
And everlasting might.
The Lamb is worthy that was slain
Of Power and Renown,
Of Wisdom, Honor, and to wear,
The Royal Glorious Crown.
Amen, Amen, the Angels Cry,
Salvation is his due,
And we through all Eternity,
His praises will renew.
Thanks, Glory, Blessing, Wisdom, Might,
Honor and Power then,
Be to our God for ever more,
For evermore. Amen.
A Song of Praise for Deliverance from Enemies.
Mr. M.
O God who do the World command,
Thou Check'st both Wind and Waves,
The Devils which like Lions Roar,
Are thine inchained Slaves.
The Sons of Rage are smoking Brands,
And Idols feared in vain;
Thou, Lord, the true and only God,
Their fury do restrain.
Thou, Lord, did smooth fierce Esau's brow,
And change his murmuring breath;
Thou gav'st to him a Brother's heart,
Who vowed his Brothers Death.
Angels do Arm at thy Command,
And Stars have shot their Dart;
Nature has fought, and Miracles
Have took thy Churches part.
Thee Lord, who still thy Church do love,
All Creatures must obey;
And when for thine thou do arise,
Their Enemies, where are they?
I cried to Heaven in my distress,
And to my God did flee;
He with compassion heard my cry;
He did arise for me.
With humble fear and thankful joy,
Lord, at thy feet I fall,
Unfeignedly acknowledging,
That thou alone do all.
Thou art all Love, thou art all Power,
And so thou art to me;
Blessed be my God now, and henceforth,
And to Eternity.
A Song of Praise for Joy in the Holy Ghost.
Dr. H.
MY Soul does magnify the Lord,
My Spirit does rejoice,
In God my Savior, and my God;
I hear his joyful voice.
I need not go abroad for Joy,
Who have a Feast at home;
My sighs are turned into songs;
The Comforter is come.
Down from above the blessed Dove
Is come into my breast,
To witness God's Eternal Love;
This is my heavenly Feast.
This makes me Abba Father cry,
With confidence of Soul;
It makes me cry, my Lord, my God,
And that without control.
There is a stream, which issues forth
From God's Eternal Throne,
And from the Lamb, a living stream,
Clear as the Crystal Stone.
This stream does water Paradise,
It makes the Angels sing;
One Cordial drop revives my heart,
Hence all my Joys do spring.
Such Joys as are unspeakable,
And full of Glory too,
Such hidden Manna, hidden Pearls,
As worldlings do not know.
Eye has not seen, nor Ear has heard,
From fancy it is concealed,
What thou Lord, have laid up for thine,
And have to me revealed.
I see thy Face, I hear thy Voice,
I taste thy sweetest Love;
My Soul does leap, but O for wings,
The wings of Noah's Dove!
Then should I flee far hence away,
Leaving this World of sin;
Then should my Lord put forth his hand,
And kindly take me in.
Then should my Soul with Angels feast,
On Joys that always last;
Blessed be my God, the God of Joy,
Who gives me here a taste.
A Song of Praise for Peace of Conscience.
M.
MY God, my reconciled God,
Creator of my Peace,
Thee will I love, and praise, and sing,
Till life and breath shall cease.
My thoughts did rage, my Soul was tossed,
'Twas like a troubled Sea;
But what a mighty voice is this,
Which winds and waves obey?
God speaks the word, peace and be still,
My sins, those Mutineers,
With speed went off and took their flight,
Where now are all my fears?
The World can neither give nor take,
Nor yet can understand,
That Peace of God, which Christ has bought,
And gives me with his hand.
This is my Savior's Legacy,
Confirmed by his decease,
Ye shall have trouble in the World,
In me ye shall have peace.
And so it is the World does rage,
But peace in me does reign;
And whilst my God maintains the Fort,
Their Batt'ries are in vain.
The burning Bush was not consumed,
Whilst God remained there;
The three, when Christ did make the fourth,
Found Fire as meek as Air.
So is my memory stuffed with sins,
Enough to make an Hell;
And yet my Conscience is not scorched
For God in me does dwell.
Where God does dwell, sure Heaven is there,
And singing there must be,
Since Lord thy presence makes my Heaven,
Whom should I sing but thee?
My God, my reconciled God,
Creator of my Peace,
Thee will I love, and praise, and sing,
Till Life and Breath shall cease.
Hymn XLIV. A Song of Praise for Pardon of Sin.
MY God a God of pardon is,
His Bosom gives me ease,
I have not, do not please my God,
Yet mercy him does please.
My sins aloud for vengeance call,
But lo! a Fountain Springs,
From Christ's pierced side, with louder cries,
And speaks better things.
My sins have reached up to the Heavens,
But Mercies height exceeds.
Gods Mercy is above the Heavens,
Above my sinful deeds.
My sins are many, like the Stars,
Or Sands upon the shore;
But yet the Mercies of my God
Are infinitely more.
Manassah, Paul, and Magdalen,
Were pardoned all by thee,
I read it, and believe it, Lord,
For thou have pardoned me.
When God shall search the World for Sin,
What trembling will be there?
O Rocks and Mountains cover us,
Will be the Sinners Prayer!
But the Lambs wrath they need not fear,
Who once have felt his love.
And they that walk with God below,
Shall dwell with God above.
Rage, Earth, and Hell, come Life, come Death,
Yet still my Song shall be,
God was, and is* and will be good
And merciful to me.
Hymn XLV. Variety of Providence, Psalm 147.
Dr. W.
GIVE Laud unto the Lord,
It is a pleasant thing,
His Praises to record,
And his sweet Songs to Sing:
Who on a Rock
His Church erects,
And recollects
His scattered Flock.
He heals the Heart contrite,
And binds up all their wounds,
He tells the Stars of Light
Whose numbers so abound,
And he can call
Each shining flame
Of them by name,
He knows them all.
Great is this God of ours,
Yea most exceeding great,
His Power above all Powers,
And has the Sovereign Seat,
And as his Might,
So likewise his
Pure Wisdom is
Most infinite.
O Salem praise the Lord,
Praise him O Sion-hill,
Who has thy Gates well-barr'd,
And does thy Cities fill;
Thy Peace full great
He makes to be,
And fills thee
With Flower of Wheat.
Through the earth his Mandats go,
His word most swiftly flies:
Like Wool he gives Snow,
His Frost as Ashes lies:
His Ice is rolled
As morsels, and
O who can stand
Before his cold?
He speaks and straight it thaws,
He breathes, and Water flows:
To Israel his Laws,
(And to none else) he shows:
As for his word,
No Heathen Land
Does understand;
Praise ye the Lord.
M.
Hymn XLVI. For the Gospel.
Blessed be my God that I was born,
To hear the joyful sound;
That I was born to be Baptized,
And bred on Christian ground.
That I was bred where God appears,
In tokens of his Grace;
The lines are fallen unto me,
In a most pleasant place.
The Sun which rose up in the East,
And drove their shades away;
His healing Wings have reached the West
And turned our Night to day.
England at first an Egypt was,
Since that proud Babels Slave;
At last a Canaan it became,
And then my Birth it gave.
Blessed be my God that I have slept
The dismal Night away,
Being kept in Providence's Womb,
To England's brightest day.
M.
Hymn XLVII. For Redemption.
O That I had an Angels Tongue!
That I might loudly sing
The wonders of Redeeming Love,
To thee, my God and King.
But Man, who at the Gates of Hell,
Did pale and speechless lie,
Must find a Tongue, and Time to speak,
Or else the Stones will cry.
Let the Redeemed of the Lord
Their thankful Voices raise.
Can we be Dumb, whilst Angels Sing
Our great Redeemers Praise?
Come let us join with Angels then,
Glory to God on high;
Peace upon Earth, Good Will to Men,
Amen, Amen, say I.
Poor Adam's Race was Satan's prey,
And Dust the Serpent's food.
We that were doomed to be devoured,
Naked and Trembling stood.
Love Clothed with Humility,
Built here an House of Clay,
In which it dwelt, and rescued Man:
The Devil lost his Prey.
The spightful Serpent bruised Christ's heel,
But then Christ brake his Head,
And left him Nailed upon the Cross,
On which his Blood was shed.
Sing and triumph in boundless Grace,
Which thus has set thee free;
Extol with shouts my ravished Soul,
Thy Savior's Love to thee.
Give endless thanks to God, and say,
What Love was this in thee,
That thou have not withheld thy Son,
Thine Only Son from me.
Thy Deep and Glorious Counsels, Lord,
With Trembling I Adore,
Blessed thrice blessed be my God,
Blessed for ever more.
M.
Hymn XLVIII. For the Morning.
MY God was with me all this night,
And gave me sweet Repose;
My God did watch even whilst I slept,
Or I had never Rose.
How many groaned and wished for sleep,
Until they wished for day.
Measuring slow hours with their quick pains,
Whilst I securely lay!
What terrors have I escaped this night,
Which have on others fell?
My body might have slept its last,
My soul have waked in hell.
Sweet rest has gained that strength to me,
Which labor did Devour.
My body was in weakness laid,
But it is raised in power.
Lord, for the mercies of the night,
My humble thanks I pay;
And unto thee I dedicate
The first fruits of the day.
Worldly concerments touch me not,
below the mount abide;
I must ascend to th'Father first,
My Savior else will chide.
This Day I Will praise thee, O my God,
And so I Will all my Days,
O Lord, let mine Eternal Day,
Be thine Eternal Praise.
M.
Hymn XLIX. For the Evening.
NOW from the Altar of my Heart,
Let flames of Incense rise;
Assist me, Lord, to offer up
Mine Evening Sacrifice.
Awake my Love, awake my Joy,
Awake my Heart and Tongue:
Sleep not when Mercies loudly call,
Break forth into a Song.
Man's Life's a Book of History,
The leaves thereof are days;
The Letters mercies closely joined,
The Title is thy Praise.
This day God was my Sun and Shield,
My Keeper and my Guide;
His care was on my frailty shown,
His Mercies multiplied.
Minutes and Mercies multiplied,
Have made up all this day;
Minutes came quick, but Mercies were
More fleet and free than they.
New time, new favors, and new Joy's,
Do a new Song require;
Till I shall praise thee as I would,
Accept my Hearts desire.
Lord, of my Time, whose hand has set
New time upon my score,
Then shall I praise for all my time,
When time shall be no more.
M.
Hymn L. For good Success.
IS not the Hand of God in this?
Is not his end Divine?
Lord of Success, thee will I bless,
Who on my Paths do shine.
I reap the Fruit of Gods Design,
By him it was foreseen:
He thought of this as well as I,
Or it had never been.
I blindly guessed, but he fore-knew:
I wished, he did command.
Wherefore I praise his careful Eye,
And his un erring Hand.
The Bow is drawn by feeble Arms,
Aim taken in the dark,
A Providential Hand does guide
The Arrow to the Mark.
Except the Lord the City keep,
The Watchmen will be slain.
Except the Lord do build the House,
The Builder builds in vain.
Buildings are Babels, Cities Heaps,
When thou send'st Curse or Flame.
And Laboring Heads that promise Fruit,
Often bring forth Wind and Shame.
But thou have Crowned my Actions, Lord,
With good success this day:
This Crown together with my self,
At thy blessed Feet I lay.
Lord, who art pleased to prosper me,
And bless me in my ways.
Prosper my weak endeav'ring Heart,
Which aims at thy praise.
M.
Hymn LI. A General Song of Praise.
HOW shall I praise that Majesty,
Which Angels do Admire?
Let Dust in Dust in silence lie,
Sing, sing, ye Heavenly Quire.
Thousands, of Thousands stand around
Thy Throne, O God, Most High.
Ten Thousand times, Ten Thousand sound
Thy praise; But who am I?
Thy brightness unto them appears,
Whilst I thy footsteps trace:
A sound of God comes to my Ears,
But they behold thy Face.
They sing, because thou art their Sun,
Lord, send a Beam on me;
For where Heaven is but once begun,
There Hallelujahs be.
Enlighten with Faiths Light my Heart,
Inflame it with Love's Fire;
Then shall I sing, and bear a part
With that Celestial Quire.
I shall, I fear, be dark and cold,
With all my zeal and light:
Yet when thou do accept their Gold,
Lord Treasure up my Mite.
How great a Being Lord is thine,
Which does all beings keep?
Thy knowledge is the only line,
To sound so vast a deep.
How good art thou whose goodness is
Our parent nurse, and guide;
Whose streams do water paradise,
and all the Earth beside?
Thy upper and thy nether S^rings,
Make both thy worlds to thrive,
Under thy warm and sheltring wings,
Thou keep'st two Broods alive.
Thy Arm of Might, most Mighty King,
Both Rocks and Hearts do break,
My God, thou can do every thing
But what would show thee weak.
Thou can not cross thy self, or be
Less than thy self or poor;
But whatsoever pleases thee,
That can thou do and more.
Unbelief is a Raging wave,
Dashing against a Rock.
If God do not his Israel save,
Then let Egyptians mock.
Mercy, that shining Attribute,
The Sinners Hope and Plea!
Huge Hosts of Sins in their Pursuit
Are Drowned in thy Red Sea.
This is the Devils Scourge and Sting,
This is the Angels Song,
Who Holy, Holy, Holy Sing,
In Heav*nly Canaans Tongue.
Mercy is Gods Memorial,
And in all Ages praised,
My God, thine only Son did fall,
That Mercy might be raised.
Thy bright Back-parts, O God of Grace,
I humbly here adore,
Show me thy Glory and thy Face,
That I may praise Thee more.
Since none can see thy Face and live,
For me to Die is best.
Through Jordan's streams who would not dive,
To Land at Canaan's Rest?
Hymn LII. Scripture Hymn.
Dr. H.
THIS mystery of Godliness,
Is very great and high.
God manifested in the flesh,
The Spirit did justify.
The blessed Angels saw his Face,
His word the Gentiles heard,
Believed on in the World, he was
To Gods Right Hand preferred.
But now we are come to Sion Mount,
The City of abode.
The Heavenly Jerusalem,
Where dwells the living God.
To Hosts of Angels numberless,
And to The Assembly there,
The general Church of Gods firstborn,
Whose names in Heaven appear.
And unto God the Judge of all,
On whom the World must wait,
And to the Spir'ts of all Just Men
Made perfect in that state.
To Jesus, Mediator of
The Covenant now made new,
Whose sprinkled blood speaks better things,
Than Abel's Blood could do.
Now Blessing, Glory and Renown,
Must we give all together,
To him that on the Throne sets down,
And to the Lamb for ever.
One God in Trinity,
Let Heaven and Earth adore,
From all Eternity
The same for evermore.
All Glory's his,
Who needing none,
Himself his own,
Perfection is.
B.
Hymn LIII. Reformation, as the 148. Psalm.
THUS, says the Lord of Hosts,
But yet a little while,
And I will shake all Coasts,
Yea, every Land and Isle:
Yet once again,
I shake all these,
Heaven, Earth, and Seas,
And all the main.
All Nations I will shake;
The long desired day,
Which does all Nations take,
Lo, that shall come, I say,
And (for all Coasts)
This House I will
With Glory fill,
Says th'God of Hosts.
The Glory of this last,
Far greater shall it grow,
Than of the Temple past,
The Lord of Hosts says so:
And in this place
Will I (the Lord
Of Hosts) afford,
Sweet Peace and Grace.
Yet not by might nor power,
But by my Sp'rit alone;
Says God of Hosts our Tower,
The strength of all in one:
For who art thou
O Mountain great!
(The Empire's seat)
To hinder now?
Before Zerubbabel
Thou shall become a plain:
The Stone that does excel,
(The head Stone of the same)
His Hand shall sit,
And bring it out
With general shout,
Grace, Grace to it.
The hand of that same man,
That laid the groundwork low,
Shall end what he began:
And I will overthrow
The Heathen Kings;
Who then are they
That slight the day
Of smaller things.
Hymn LIVE. A Collection from several Psalms.
PRaise ye the Lord Most High,
My Soul speak thou his Praise;
I Will praise him constantly,
And bless him all my days,
Even whilst I live
And Being have,
God who this gave,
I Will praises give.
In Princes put no trust,
Nor any Son of man:
Impotent and unjust,
None of them help us can.
He Life resigns
Returns to Dust,
And then he must
Cease his designs.
He is the happy man
Whom God does help afford;
Who own and trust God can,
Whose hope is in the Lord.
Who all things made;
Heaven, Earth, and Sea,
His Truth and they
Do never fade.
Praise ye our glorious Lord,
Who dwells in Heaven on high,
Let him be still adored,
Above the Starry Sky.
Ye Angels bright,
And all his Hosts,
Throughout Heavens Coasts
In praise delight.
His People he will raise,
And them exalt on high,
All his Saints shall him praise
And bless continually,
He is adored
By Israel,
Who near him dwell;
Praise ye the Lord.
Praise ye the Lord, and sing
A new rejoicing Song;
Praise ye our glorious King,
His holy ones among.
Where they do meet
In holy throngs,
To sing these Songs
Sacred and sweet.
Let Israel rejoice
In him that did them make;
With cheerful heart and voice
Let Sion's Sons partake.
And to their King,
Who them directs,
And still protects
This offering bring.
Hymn LV. The Doxologies.
TO Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One God in Trinity,
As ever was, and as now is,
All Glory, ever be.
Or,

To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
One God in Persons Three.
Or, One undivided Three,
Or, One consubstantial Three,
Or, One coeternal Three,
All humble thanks and joyful praise,
Or, All highest praise and humble thanks,
Now and forever be.
Or, (For ever rendered be.)
Or,

All Glory, to the blessed Three,
One Ever-living Lord;
As at the first, still shall he be
Beloved, Obeyed, Adored.
Or,

All Glory, Honor, Power and Praise
To God that is one in Three,
As it in the beginning was,
Is now, and still shall be.
Or,

All Glory to the Blessed Three,
All Honor, Power, and Praise;
As at the first, shall ever be,
Beyond the end of days.
Or,

To Father Son, and Holy Ghost,
All [Praise and] Glory be therefore;
As in beginning was, is now,
And shall be [henceforth] evermore:
Or,

Glory to thee O Lord,
One God in Persons three:
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One equal Glory be.
Hymn LVI. For the Sabbath.
IF from my Holy Sabbath day,
Thou turn away thy Foot,
And do not by thy Pleasure stray,
My Sabbath to pollute:
But call the Sabbath a delight,
The Holy of the Lord,
And thy own Carnal Pleasure slite,
In Thought, in Deed, in Word;
Then shall thou joy in God alone,
With sweet and sacred mirth,
And he shall make thee ride upon
High Places of the Earth.
With Father Jacob's Heritage,
The Lord shall feed thee Fat;
For thus does Gods own Mouth engage,
And thou may trust to that.
To God the Father, and the Son,
And Holy Ghost therefore,
Be Glory, Honor, and Renown,
And Power for evermore.
Hymn LVII. as the 25 Psalm.
LET others take their course,
And sing what name they please,
Let wealth or beauty be their Theme,
Such empty sounds as these.
Sweet Jesus is the Name
My Song shall still adore,
Sweet Jesus is the charming word,
That does my Life restore.
When I am dead in grief,
Or which is worse, in Sin,
I call on Jesus, and he hears,
And I to live begin.
Wherefore to thee dear Lord,
Behold thus low I bow;
And thus again, yet is all this
Far less than what I owe.
Live glorious King of Heaven,
By all thy Heaven adored,
Live gracious Savior of the World,
Our Chief and Only Lord.
Live, and forever may
Thy Throne established be:
For ever may all Hearts and Tongues,
Sing Hymns of Praise to thee.
Hymn LVIII. as the 100 Psalm.
With all the powers my poor Soul has,
Of humble Love, and loyal Faith;
Thus low my God I bow to Thee,
Whom with more love bowed lower to me.
Down busy sense, discourses dye,
And all adore Faiths mystery,
Faith is my skill, Faith can believe
As fast as Love new Laws can give.
Faith is my Eye, Faith strength affords,
To keep pace with those powerful words,
And words more sure more sweet than they,
Love could not think, Truth could not say.
O dear memorial of that Death
That still survives, and gives us Breath.
Live ever Bread of Life, and be
My Food, my Joy, and All to me.
Come glorious Lord, my hopes increase,
And fill my portion in thy peace,
Come hidden Life, and that long day
For which I languish, come away.
When this dry Soul those Eyes shall see,
And drink the unsealed source of Thee;
When glorious Sun Faith's shade shall chase,
And for thy Veil give me thy Face.
Hymn LIX. as 25 Psalm.
COme mild and holy Dove,
Descend into our Breast,
Do thou in us, make us in Thee
Forever dwell and rest.
Come and spread over our heads,
Thy soft all cher'shing Wing,
That in its shade we safely sit,
And to thee praises sing.
To thee who gives us Life,
Our better Life of Grace,
Who gives us breath, and strength and speed,
To run and win our race.
If by the way we faint,
Thou reachest forth thy Hand:
If our own weakness makes us fail,
Thou make our weakness stand.
When we are sliding back,
Thou do our dangers stop,
When we again, alas, are fallen,
Again thou take us up.
Else there we still must lie,
And still sink lower down.
Our hope to rise is all from Thee,
Our ruin's all our own.
O our ungrateful Souls!
What shall our dullness do
For him that does all this for us,
Only our love to woo?
We love thee then, dear Lord!
But thou must give that Love,
We'll humbly beg it of thy Grace,
But thou our Prayers must move.
Oh hear thine own self speak,
For thou in us do pray:
Thou can as quickly grant as ask,
Thy Grace knows no delay.
Glory to thee O Lord,
One Coeternal Three,
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
One equal glory be.
Of Praise and Hope.
MY God, had I my Breath from Thee,
This power to speak and sing?
And shall my Voice, and shall my Song,
Praise any but their King?
My God, had I my Soul from thee,
This power to Judge and Choose,
And shall my Brain, and shall my Will,
Their best to thee refuse?
Alas, not this alone, nor that
Have thou bestowed on me,
But all I have, and shall, I hope,
I have, and hope from Thee.
And more I have, and more I hope,
Then I can speak or think;
Thy blessings first refresh, then fill,
Then overflows the brink.
But though my voice and fancy be
Too low to reach thy praise,
Yet both shall strain thy glorious name,
High as they can to raise.
Hymn LX. For the Morning, as 100 Psalm.
OPen mine Eyes my Soul, and see
Once more the Light returns to thee,
Look round about, and choose the Way
Thou mean to travel over to day.
Think on the dangers thou may meet,
And always watch thy sliding Feet,
Think where thou once have fallen before,
And mark the place, and fall no more:
Think on the helps that God bestows,
And cast to Steer thy Life by those,
Think on the sweets thy Soul did feel,
When thou did well, and do so still.
Think on the pains that shall torment,
Those stubborn Souls that never Repent,
Think on the Joys that wait above,
To Crown the Head of Holy Love.
Think what at last will be thy part,
If thou go on where now thou art,
See Life and Death, set thee to choose,
One thou must take, and one refuse.
O my dear Lord, guide thou my course,
And draw me on with thy sweet force,
Still make me walk, still make me tend,
By thee my way, to thee my end.
All glory to the Sacred three
One undivided Deity,
As it has been in ages gone,
May now and ever still be done.
Hymn LXI. The Common Tune for the Evening.
NOW, O my Soul, the day is gone,
Which in the Morn was thine,
It Is emptied Glass no more shall run.
It Is Sun no longer shine.
It Is true, alas, the day is gone,
O were it only so!
Is it not lost as well as done?
Cast up thy Counts and know.
Art thou got so much nearer Heaven,
As nearer to the Grave,
Has thy Hearts grief a fitness given,
Sin's Pardon to receive?
From what base vice have thou refrained,
To break the Course of Sin.
Or what new virtue have thou gained
To make thee rich within?
There time is well bestowed on those
Who well their time bestow,
Whose main concern still forward goes,
Whose hopes still riper grow.
Who when the warning Clocks proclaim
Another hour is past,
Have the wise art to set their aim
And thoughts upon their last.
This sad Life's last and happiest hour,
Which brings them to their home,
Where they shall sing and bless the Power;
That made them thither come.
O my dear Lord of Life and Death,
The ever-living King,
Since thou do give to all their Breath,
May all thy glory sing!
FINIS.
