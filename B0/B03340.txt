FOLLY plainly made Manifest, BY An Extravagant Husband
B^ing his kind Advice to all, of high or low Degree,
Least they in Poverty do fall, and bring themselves to misery.
To the Tune of, I have a Mistress of my own.


BAd Husbands now I pray draw near,
and also hearken to my Ditty;
Of evil company beware,
for if you don't the more's the pity:
For by the same we plainly see,
some men do work their own undoing,
And bring themselves to poverty,
and their poor Families to ruin.
For those that do delight in it,
would certainly increase their trouble
Beside they dullifie their wit,
and add their sorrows ten times double
For when that you have wasted all,
they will certainly abuse you,
When you in any troubles fall,
they will utterly refuse you.
I do remember formerly,
when I used the trade of drinking,
My wife and I could not agree,
for my pocket that was shrinking:
Daily I did take much pains,
yet my folly overruled me,
The Alehouse then received the gains,
and in my trouble they did fool me.
My Wife with tears persuaded me,
but I afforded her no pity,
But gave my self such liberty,
I rambled through Town and City:
Thus my wife and Children small,
they might weep till they were weary,
While I for Liquor freely called,
with which I made my heart full merry


THus my wife and children small,
they had nothing to relieve them,
When they to her for Bread did call,
the had never a bit to give them:
Then her sorrows they were great,
she with tears did much lament it,
To see her poor unhappy state,
and knows not how to be contented.
The Ale-wives kindness to him in a time of Trouble.
At length I being out of work,
they did much deride and flout me,
And said that I was but a shark,
and they had rather been without me:
Thus when I did stand in need,
all my former friends did slight me,
Which made my very heart to bleed,
I had nothing to delight me.
But I made a vow therefore,
in the heat of my vexation,
I Will set a cross upon their door,
and then i will find my habitation:
My life I will begin a new,
what I do get i will save together,
The Proverb old is very true,
a penny is good in rainy weather.
All company I have forsook,
and Alehouses where I did lie at,
And better courses I have took,
which brings me to much peace and quiet;
I Will be a Husband to my wife,
and I will do my best endeavor,
To have the Comfort of our life,
and live in love like lambs togther.
I very seldom had my health,
beside the charge of my expenses,
I often was beside my self,
for drinking robbed me of my senses:
I Will never do the like again,
I will utterly refrain them,
The Hostess she shall sit and Spin,
for they are fools that will maintain them.
Let all, bad husbands mend with speed,
before old age does overtake you,
For when you most do stand in need,
your feigned friends will quite forsake you
When your youthful strength is past,
you will be from them quite absented,
Griefs and sorrows comes at last,
then too late you may repent it.
FINIS.
