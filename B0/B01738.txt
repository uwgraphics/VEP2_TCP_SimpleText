The Hasty Wedding; OR, William's Patience Rewarded. With the consent of Pretty
NANCY.
To the Tune of, The Man of Fashion, or, The Doubting Virgin.


SItting with my Dearest Dear,
by a Little purling Spring,
In the pleasant time o'th year,
when the little Birds do sing,
Straight I was resolved to move her,
for to know how she inclined,
And to tell her that I loved her,
and desire to know her mind.
Then quoth I, my pretty Nancy,
well thou know thou have my heart;
Thou alone art she I fancy,
and can only cure my smart:
Tell me then my pretty fair one,
when you mean to change your life,
Tell me quickly then my Dear one,
when you will be Willy's Wife.




Truly William then quoth Nancy,
men they say are grown so strange,
Every one they will swear they fancy,
so they may perhaps for change:
You may freely say your pleasure,
I can hear without distaste,
Marriage should be done with leisure,
and I Am sure I Am not in have.
Will you be a peevish creature,
and deny your self a cure,
Who could teach you such ill nature,
not your Mother I am sure:
She was scarce arrived at fourteen,
when she lost a single life,
And was pleased so well with courting
that she soon became a wife.
This I know is her confession,
but I Have heard her often to pray,
That I might have more discretion,
and to wait a longer day:
Therefore I do tell you fairly,
some years more I mean to wast,
Though indeed I love you dearly,
yet I am not so much in haste.
Well quoth he have, you consented,
gave me hope, though very cold,
If you have not again repented,
I shall have you when you are old:
I have patience and you know it,
still to wait on you whilst life,
And will never think much to do it,
if that you will be my wife.
Now quoth she, i am sure you love me,
since you are content to stay,
And your patience does so move me,
I will marry you this day:
Now I see you love me dearly,
we no longer time will wast,
And I do declare it clearly,
that I am as much in have.
Hand in hand these Lovers walked,
many a kiss she did exchange,
Many a vow pass as they talked
that their hearts should never range
To te Church he did conduct her,
whhre the Priest did end the strife,
And so well he did instruct her,
she that day was William's Wife
Printed for, P. Brooksby, at the Golden-Ball in Pye-corner.
