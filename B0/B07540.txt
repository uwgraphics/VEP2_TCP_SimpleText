LONDON, Printed by NICHOLAS OAKS, and are to be sold by Thomas Langley, at his
shop over against the Sarazens head without Newgate. 1618.

TO The Right Worshipful, Sir Henry Griffith, of Agnes Burton, Knight, one of
his Majesty's Counsel in the North, and Deputy Lieutenant, in the
East Riding, and William Saint-Quintin of Harpham Esquire, Grace and peace.
GENTLEMEN,
SEeing they that live under you for their estates and bodies, are under my
cure and care for their souls, you will give me leave (nay thanks I am sure)
to be as careful for the better part as you I hope are and will be for the
worse: You know it were a shame to you, if they could justly say they were not
able to live and eat their bread under you their Lords: and more were it to me
their Pastor, if they wanted either the Milk, or the Meat fit for their
souls.

To this end seeing I find, that Catechizing is the life of Preaching, and
such a means of knowledge as without it all preaching is to little purpose, I
have here dressed them their first dish, even a mease of Milk (the old, plain
and good meat of our forefathers) I mean this short and easy Catechism: Not
as making a new one, for hat were a needless presumption but as a help to
understand that good Catechism given us already in the Common Prayer Book.

Now seeing your experience in your families, and mine in the whole Parish has
found the benefit of Catechizing to be so extraordinary, we have cause to
acknowledge the godly wisdom and care of our Church Governors in commanding
the performance of that duty in every Parish: which if it were duly observed
over all the Land, I dare say, where there is no Preaching the want would be
less hurtful, and where it is, the benefit much more abundant. And let it
work in you a care, Gen 18.
not only as good Abraham's, to command your families, but (seeing you are here
Magistrates and Lords) like zealous David's, Psalm. 110.
to take order that your people and tenants do frequent this godly exercise,
which by Gods good blessing shall by me, or my sufficient Deputy be
continually kept up, as the time and season of the year will permit. This will
make our Sermons at home, and our Exercises abroad much more profitable and
effectual, your Servants and Tenants more faithful to God, and more
serviceable to your selves. And when they find themselves mercifully dealt
withal by you their Landlords for their bodies: and good provision, both of
Milk and strong meat for their souls: Their Job. 31. 20.
Loins (as Job says) shall bless you, their hearts love me, and their
souls and all within them shall praise God for us both: and their Neighbors
about them shall say. Blessed are the people that be in such a case, yea thrice
happy the people that have the Lord for their God. Now praying that both you
and I, and they that follow us may strive to deserve this honor, and enjoy
this comfort; and our people receive this double blessing by us,

I rest Your Pastor and servant in Christ, WILLIAM CRASHAVV.

Saint Paul's words applyable to many of the people and professors in England.
Whereas in regard of the time, Heb. 5, 12, 13, 14.
you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you the first
principles of the Oracles of GOD, and are such as have need of Milk, and not
of strong Meat: for every one that uses Milk, is unskillful in the Word of
Righteousness, for he is a Babe. But strong Meat belongs to them that are
of full age, even those which by reason of use, are exercised to discern of
good and evil Heb. 5, 12, 13, 14.

Saint Peter's exhortation, which I direct chiefly to the people of the North.
LAy aside all Malice, all Guile 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3.
and Hypocrisies, and Enuies, and evil speakings. And as newborn Babes,
desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby, now that you
have tasted how gracious the Lord is. 1. Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3.

An household Prayer for the Morning.
O Thou most mighty Creator, Preserver and Savior of our souls and bodies, we
here acknowledge to thy Glory, that it is only through thy Power and Mercy,
we have enjoyed the rest, and escaped the dangers of the night past: for, we
confess we have deserved, that the darkness of Death should have seized on
us, and given us up into the hands of eternal darkness, because we have
spent our lives in the deeds of darkness: Blessed therefore be thy holy
Name, for that thou have not dealt with us according to our deseruings. And now
we humble our selves before thee, and pray thee on the knees of our hearts,
that as thou have delivered us from the darkness of the Night, so thou
would deliver our souls from the spiritual darkness of Sin, Error,
Superstition and Profaneness, that so we may never come within the danger of
eternal darkness: And as thou have restored to us the light of this life, so
good LORD vouchsafe to enlighten our hearts with the better light of thy
heavenly truth, and holy Grace: that as the light of this world sufficiently
shows us our way, and directs our steps and actions of the body: so the
Spirit and Grace of Christ Jesus, shining in our souls, may show us the way to
walk in, lead us in the way everlasting, and guide our feet in the way of
peace. And thou most merciful God, who have given our bodies rest and sleep,
we beseech thee in thy greater mercy, give rest to our souls, and sweet
peace unto our consciences this day, and all our days: and thou that have
delivered us from the perils of the night, save us from the sins of this day,
and deliver us from the far greater dangers, which our sins may pull upon
us.

O Lord we go into the world, and can hardly have to do with it, but the
contagion of sin, will catch hold of us, Lord teach us with heavenly wisdom,
to see and avoid the same: arm us with heavenly courage, to break through
the snares which sin and Satan, and the wicked world shall lay in our way.
And thou that art the God of blessing, vouchsafe to bless us this day in our
souls and bodies, in the use of both our callings, general as we are
Christians, and members of thy Church, and personal, as we are members of
this commonwealth: In our personal callings Lord enable us to love our
Neighbor as our selves, and to do to every one as we would have them do to
us: and give us a conscionable care of such duties as belong unto us, make us
faithful, laborious and diligent in the discharge of them, yet suffer us not
so far to be carried away with the cares of the world, and the labor of our
callings, as that we should neglect the duties of Piety and godliness,
commanded unto us in our general calling; but teach us gracious GOD, to join
the practice of these both together, and never to separate them whilst we live
in the world, but that in the one we may labor faithfully to serve our
brethren, and in the other, zealously to serve and glorify thee our God; That
thus we may with cheereful hearts, and good consciences, spend our days, and
wait for our consummation in Heaven, when our days on earth shall be
accomplished: And when these days and nights, which now eat up our lives,
shall have an end, we may then escape the everlasting night, and enjoy the
blessed fruition of that bright and ouer-shining Day in thy Kingdom, where all
our cares and cumbers, our toils and troubles, our wrongs and oppressions
shall have an end, where all tears shall be wiped from our eyes, and where
with thee, the blessed God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, and with
Jesus Christ, in our own flesh, and with all the Holy Angels, and the Saints
gone before us, we shall receive the reward of our labors, the issue of our
hope, the end of our faith, and salvation of our souls, through the blessed
and glorious merits of our only Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in whose most
holy Name we recommend to thy mercy, thy whole Church: and these especially,
whereof thou have made us members and beseech thee for thy special blessing
upon our gracious Sovereign the King, the Queen, the Prince, the Prince and
Princes Palatine: This whole State and all whom thou have set over us in Church
or commonwealth: upon the Ministry, with our Universities, the Magistracy,
with the Judges, and Innes of Court, upon our brethren in Virginia, and Summers
Islands, and all that help to bear thy name unto the Gentiles: whose
conversion Lord we beseech thee hasten as also the restoration of the Jews,
thy ancient and beloved people. As for the Turk and Pope and all the known
enemies of thy Grace and Glory, convert them Lord if they belong to thee, else
remove them out of the way, and let them go to their own place. Remember all
thy Children afflicted in mind or distressed in body, and all those whom we
ought peculiarly to pray for: Lord bless them and us, and hear us for them,
and them for us: and Christ Jesus our glorious Mediator for us all: In whose
Name we offer to thy Majesty our souls and bodies, and this our poor Morning
sacrifice, in that most holy and perfect prayer that he has left us.

Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name: Thy Kingdom come: Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven: Give us this day our daily Bread:
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us:
And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil: For thine is the
Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever. AMEN.

THe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of GOD our Father, and the
comfortable fellowship of God the Holy Ghost, etc.

A household Prayer for the Evening.
MOst Mighty Lord GOD, and merciful Father, the day is thine, and the night is
thine, thou have created the Light and the Sun, and calls for darkness at
thy pleasure: blessed for ever be thou, who gives us the rest of the night, and
comforts of the day: And now we confess to thy glory, O Lord, that even for
the sins of this day, if thou should call us to account, we were not able
to abide it, for we have sinned against thee this day, both in Omission of
good, and in doing of evil, both toward thee, and toward our brethren, we
have not dealt with others, as we would have them deal with us, we have taken
unlawful liberty to our selves, in thoughts, words and deeds, we have abused
thy good creatures to gluttony, drunkenness, wantonness, or excess, we have
dealt either negligently or unfaithfully in our callings: and all this, O Lord,
and much more, because we have not set thee before our eyes, nor nourished thy
fear in our hearts. To us therefore in justice, belongs nothing but shame and
confusion. For thou art a righteous and a powerful God, and we confess there
is good cause, that thy justice should condemn us, and thy power confound us;
Have mercy therefore upon us O merciful Father, even for thy Son our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake, forgive us all that is past, and remember that he came
into the world, to save sinners: we have sinned, O Lord, and have need of thy
mercy: O Lord, show thy mercy upon us, and grant us thy salvation: And seeing
thy promises are effectual to none, but them that believe, O LORD, increase
our Faith in thee, and in all the sweet promises of thy Word, let us take hold
of them, believe them, and rest upon them in life and death. And forasmuch as
pardon is not given but to the penitent, O LORD work in us true repentance for
all our sins past. Let us sorrow more for sinning against thee, then for all
the wants and miseries, crosses and losses of this world: And Lord make us new
creatures, work in us reformation and amendemnt of life, and every day we
live, let us grow in grace and spiritual strength, that as we are daily
elder, so we may be better, and the nearer we draw to our ends, grant Lord,
we may draw the nearer to thee, and to everlasting happiness with thee in
Christ Jesus. And now being reconciled to thee our God, give us leave to call
for a blessing upon us and our labors in our callings this day, for without
thee O Lord all is in vain, though we rise early and go late to bed, and
eat the bread of carfulness: Bless us therefore most blessed God, and all
the works of our hands, Lord reward what is well done, and pardon what is
amiss, give us also good Lord hearts humbled under thy Judgments, thankful
for thy mercies and contented in our places with the portion thy providence
assigns unto us, and teach us to wait on thee and on thy good providence in
all our needs and necessities of soul and body. And let nothing of this world
trouble our hearts, O Lord our God, but let us have grace to believe that thou
who have given Jesus Christ to save us, can deny us nothing: thus good Lord
let us live the life of Faith, whilst we are here, that after this life ended,
we may receive the end of our Faith, the salvation of our souls, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. In whose Name and mediation we recommend to thy mercy, thy
whole Church, and all whom we any way ought to pray for, as well as if we had
named them particularly: for thou know them all O Lord, better then we, and
what they need for soul and body, Lord be merciful; to them and bless
them, as our selves, make us partakers of their prayers, and them of ours, and
let thy protection be over them and us, and al ours this night following,
giving us the rest and sleep thou know needful for these poor and vile
bodies, and thereby enabling us to the duties and burdens, which the day
following shall bring upon us. Hear us for our selves good Lord, and for all
thine, and for every one of us in this family, from the highest to the lowest,
(for with thee is no respect of persons) and answer us in these, and all other
good blessings, which thou know good for us, and make us truly thankful
for thy many good blessings, this day, and all our days, bestowed on us, even
for the merits and bloodshedding of Jesus Christ. To whom blessed Father,
with thee, and the Holy Spirit of Grace, our only and Eternal God, be praise
and glory, now and evermore. Amen.

THe Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God our Father, and the
comfortable fellowship of God the Holy Ghost, be with all Gods children, and
us in this family, in our souls and bodies, this night, and evermore. Amen.

FINIS.
