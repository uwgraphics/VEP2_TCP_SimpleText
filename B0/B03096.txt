Englands Great Prognosticator, Foretelling when England shall enjoy a settled
peace and happiness again, Not by Planets, Signs, nor by Stars,
But truly tells when ends these bloody wars.

To the Tune of, When the King injoyes his own again.


WHat Booker can Prognosticate
Concerning of our Kingdoms fate?
I think my self to be as wise
As most that gazes in the Skies
my skill goes beyond
the depth of Pond,
Or Rivers in the greatest rain,
by which I can tell
all things will be well,
Now the King injoyes his own again.
There Is neither Swallow, Dove, nor Dade,
Can soar more high, nor deeper wade,
To give you a reason from the Stars,
What causes Peace, or Civil wars,
the man in the Moon,
may wear out his shoon,
In running after Charles his wane,
and all to no end,
for the times they will mend,
Now the King enjoyes his own again.
Though for a time you saw White Hall,
With cobwebs hanging on the wall,
Instead of Silk and silver brave,
As formerly it used to have,
in every room,
the sweet perfume
Delightful for a Princely train,
the which you may see,
now the time it shall be,
That the King is come home in peace again.
Full forty years the Royal Crown,
Has been his Fathers, and his own,
And is there any more than he,
Has right unto that Sovereignty?
then who better may
the Scepter sway,
Than he that has such right to reign
the hopes of our peace
for the wars will cease,
Now the King is come home in peace again.
Till when, Ararat upon thy Hill,
My hopes did east her Anchour still,
Until I saw some peaceful Dove,
Bring home that branch which dear I love,
till then I did wait,
the waters abate,
Which most disturbed my troubled brain,
and never did rejoice,
till I did hear the voice,
That the King enjoyes his own again.
Oxford and Cambridge still agree,
Crowned with honor and dignity.
Learned men shall now take place,
Tub-men be silenced with disgrace,
for they shall know
'twas but an outward show
That they so long disturbed their brain,
so I can tell
that all things will be well
Now the King is come home in peace again.


CHurch Government shall settled be,
And then I hope we shall agree,
Without their helps whose hair-brained zeal,
Has long disturbed the Commonweal,
Green's out of date,
and the Cobbler does prate,
Of whimsies that disturbs his brain,
the which you shall see,
when the time it shall be,
Now the King enjoyes his own again.
Though many men are much in debt,
And diverse shops are to be let,
A golden time is drawing near,
Men shall want shops for their ware,
all Trades shall increase
by the means of a Peace
The which ere long we shall obtain,
for which I can tell
all things will be well,
Now the King enjoys his own again.
Maidens shall enjoy their Mates,
And honest men their lost estates,
Women shall have what they do lack,
Their husbands are a coming back
when the wars have an end,
then I and my friend,
A Subjects freedom shall obtain,
for this I can tell,
all things will be well
Now the King enjoys his own again.
People shall walk without any fear,
About the Country every where.
Thieves shall tremble at the Law,
And Justice keep them all in awe,
Papists shall fly,
with their trumpery
And then a fig for Rome and Spain,
the which you shall see,
when the time it shall be,
Now the King is come home in peace ag^^^
The Parliament most willing be,
That all the world may plainly see,
How they do labor still for Peace,
That all these bloody wars may cease,
for they will spend
their lives to defend
The King in all his rights to reign,
so I can tell,
all things will be well,
Now the King enjoys his own again.
When all these things to pass shall come,
Then farewell Musket, Pike, and Drum,
The Lamb shall with the Lion feed,
That were a happy time indeed,
O let all pray,
that we may see the day,
That Peace may govern Charles his Wane,
for then I can tell,
all things will be well
Now the King enjoyes his own again.
