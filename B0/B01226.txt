A proper new balad in praise of my Lady Marquis* Whose death is be wailed,
To the tune of new lusty gallant.


LAdies I think you marvel that
I writ no merry report to you,
And what is the cause I court it not
So merye as I was wont to do,
Alas I let you understand,
It is no news for me to show,
The fairest flower of my garland
Was caught from court a great while a go.
For under the roufe of sweet Saint Paull,
There lies my Lady buried in Claye,
Where I make memory for her soul,
With weepinge eyes once every day,
All other sightes I have for got,
That ever in court I ioyed to see:
And that is the cause I court it not,
So merry as I was wont to be,
And though that she be dead and gone,
Whose courting need not to be told,
And natures mould of flesh and bone,
Whose like now lives not to be hold,
Me thinks I see her walk in black,
In every corner where I go:
To look if any body do lack,
A friend to help them of their woe.
Me thinks I see her sorrowful tears,
To princelye state approaching nigh
Me thinks I see her tremblinge fears,
Lest any her suites should hit a wrie,
Me thinks she should be still in place
A pitiful speaker to a Queen,
Bewailinge every poor man's case,
As many a time the has been seen.
Me thinks I see her modeste mood
Her comlie clothig plainly clad,
Her face so sweet her cheer so good,
The courtly countenance that she had
But chief of all me thinks I see,
Her virtues dentie day by day,
Homblie kneeling one her knee
As her desire was still to pray.
Me thinks I cold from morrow to night
Do no thing else very good will,
But spend the time to speak and writ:
The praise of my good ladies still
Though reason says now she is dead
To seek and sarue as good as she
It will not sink so in my head
That ever the like in court will be.
But sure I am there lives yet,
In court a dearer frinde to me,
Whom I to sarue am so un fit,
I am sure the like will never be,
For I with all that I can do,
Unworthy most may seem to be
To undo the lachet of her shoe,
Yet will I come to court and see.
Then have a mongste ye once a gain,
Faint hearts fair Ladies never win,
I trust ye will consider my pain,
When any good Venison comes in,
And gentill Ladies I you pray,
If my absentinge breed to blame,
In my behalf that ye will say,
In court is remedy for the same.
