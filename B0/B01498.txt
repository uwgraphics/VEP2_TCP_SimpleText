Alas poor Tradesmen what shall we do.
OR, LONDONS Complaint through badnesse of Trading, For work being scant, their
substance is fadeing.

To the Tune of, Hallow my Fancy Whether Will thou good.




A Midst of melancholy trading,
out of my store,
I found my substance fading
all my haushold viewing,
which to ruin
Falls daily more and more:
Forth then I went
And walked about the City,
Where I beheld
What moved my heart with pity:
And being home returned
I thought upon this ditty,
Alas poor Tradesmen
What shall we do.
Shops, Shops, Shops, I discry now
With Windows ready shut,
They Will neither sell nor buy new,
Whilst our L^rds and Gentry,
are ith Country,
the more is our grief god-wott:
Woe to the causers
Of this separation
Which bred the civil
Wars in this Nation.
It is the greatest cause
Of Londons long vacation.
Alas poor Tradesmen
What shall we do.
Forts in the fields new erected
Where multitudes do run,
To so the same effected:
All their judgment spending,
and commending
the same to be well done:
But yet I fear,
Our digging and our ramming,
Scarce can defend
The poorest sort from famine,
For all the rich may have
As much as they can cramme in,
Alas poor tradesmen
What shall we do.
One may perhaps have large
whilst thousand more complaine^
Oppressed with their charge:
All this care and toyling,
with for moyling,
affords but little gains:
In hopes of peace
Our elves have deluded,
That on our store
So far we have intruded,
Except a happy peace
Amongst us be concluded,
Alas poor tradesmen
What shall we do.
The second Part,
To the same Tune.


COrn God be thank't is not scant yet,
and yet for ought we know
The poorer sort may want it.
In the midst of plenty,
more than twenty
have found it to be so:
For if they have not
Money for to buy it,
The richer sort they
Have hearts for to deny it,
If that you will not believe me,
You Will find it when you try it,
Alas poor tradesmen
What, etc.
Whilst we were well employed,
and need not for to play,
We plenty then enjoyed:
Every week a Noble
clear without trouble,
is better than eight pence a day:
Yet on the Sabbath day
We used to rest us,
And went to the Church
To pray, and God has blessed us.
But since the civil wars
Begun for to molest us,
Alas poor tradesmen
What, etc.
All things so out of order,
the Father kills the Son,
Yet this they count no murder
Wars are necessary,
oh no, but tarry,
I wish they would not bin begun,
For where a Kingdom
Is of it self divided,
And people knows not
By whom they should be guided
It is too great a matter
By me to be decided.
Alas poor tradesmen
What, etc.
Now to conclude my ditty,
the Lord send England peace
And plenty in this City:
Grant the land may flourish,
long for to nourish
us with her blessed increase.
Our Gracious King,
The Lord preserve and bless Him
With safe return
To them that long do miss him,
And send him to remain
With them that well do wish him,
Alas poor tradesmen
What shall we do.
