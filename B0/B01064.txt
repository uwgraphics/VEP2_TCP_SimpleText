A comparison of the life of Man,
Concerning how fickle his estate does stand,
Flourishing like a Tree, or Vine, or dainty flower,
Or like a ship, or rain, that is turned each hour,
To the tune of Sir Andrew Barton.
VENICE.

LONDON.

BRISTOW.



AS I lay musing all alone,
Great store of things I thought upon,
And specially of man's estate,
And how he is subject unto fate.
First I Will compare him to a tree,
Which you sometimes all green may see,
But suddenly his leafes do fall
That he was beautified withal.
The Tree likewise is known by's fruit
Better then by his fine green suit,
He may show comely to the eye,
Yet his fruit may taste bitterly.
So men sometimes make a fair show,
All fresh and green they seem to grow,
But when the winter of grief and thrall
Does on them seize, their green leaves fall.
But for the difference of men's fruit,
I must indeed be something mute,
But those that grow like Cedars tall
Yield little fruit or none at all.
Yet do they flourish fresh and green,
Much like the pleasant summer Queen*
They are bedect with fragrant flowers,
And they do dwell in stately Towers.
But as the Tree is great and tall,
The great and mightier is his fall:
And as he falls, so does he lie,
Until the builder him apply.
What though a man have store of wealth,
It cannot him assure of health,
By his fruits he must sure be tried,
Either condemned or justified.
Again, a man is like a Vine,
That from the earth does fluorish fine,
Adorned with natures ornament,
With store of Grapes to give content.
But with a knife, or such a thing,
The Vine is soon set a bleeding,
And then those Grapes will soon decay,
And piningly will wast away.
Even so stands the life of man,
If that his blood from him be drawn,
Then suddenly his life does yield,
And unto death he is compelled.
Man flourishes even like a flower,
Which lives and dies within an hours,
He grows perhaps until his prime,
Or he may dye in's budding time.
He may chance live till he is old,
And bide the brunt of Winters cold,
But then he will lose the smell and show,
And will no more be worth the view.
So many men dye in their prime,
And some dye in their budding time:
But he that lives the longest life,
Shall find but sorrow, care, and strife.
Man's life is like a ship o'th Seas,
Which is sometimes as Fortune please,
Even as proud Boreas blasts do blow.
When Winds are still and weather's fair,
Then Mariners are free from care;
But when as storms make dark the sky,
Then must each man his labor plye.
The second part
To the same tune.




SO is it with man the self same case,
His life's a ship that seas does trace,
And often is like to go to wrack
When winds and storms do tacklings crack.
We men when sickness does assail
Our bodies, and makes us look pale,
Then would we do all things we may,
So that our health we might enjoy.
But when the Fates on us do smile,
Like Sailors we forget our toil.
We hang out colors for a show,
But take them in when storms do grow.
I may compare a man again
Even like unto a turning rain,
That changes even as does the wind,
Indeed so is man's fickle mind.
The mind of man does often change,
He Is apt with every gale to range,
He stands tottering to and fro,
Even as his foolish fancies go.
Again I may man's Life compare
Like to a bird that flies in the air,
And suddenly she sees a bayt,
Which is to take her with deceit.
The bird no sooner is betrayed,
But comes me him that the bait laid,
And having taken her in his Net,
She dies, and he for more does bait.
Even so is man by running caught,
When as thereof he has no thought,
He soareth high and fears no fail,
Yet then he is in most danger of all.
Make trial of this any one,
And you shall find that I have shown
A prospect where you may behold
The difference in this earthy mold.
This life is fickle, frail, and vain,
Seek everlasting life to gain.
All worldly treasures soon decay,
And mortal man returns to clay.
Before thou dyest bid pride adieu,
Which does so often shape thee new,
Call out for mercy with loud voice,
And let her be thy only choice.
If thou have lived in gluttony,
Forgetting quite that thou shall dye,
Then quickly charity embrace,
That she may plead well in thy case.
If thou by covetousness have lived,
And have thy neighbors poor deceived,
Then suddenly restor't again,
For fear thou feel hells burning pain.
Perchance in wrath thou have shed blood,
Which wrath should always be withstood,
Yet arm thee with a patient heart,
And never more act such a part.
If thou have enuy'd at thy brother,
Repent with speed, that black sin smother,
And let true love be thy delight,
Thou may depart with life this night.
If thou have slothful been, and lewd,
Neglecting Gods most holy word,
Apply thy self most speedily,
Redeem thy time spent idly.
If thou lascivious have been given;
Do so no more, but pray to heaven,
That hateful sin God may forgive,
Chastise thy self, repent, and grieve.
Thus to conclude, let me entreat
All those that hear what I relate,
That they seek heavens grace to find,
And always hear an upright mind.
