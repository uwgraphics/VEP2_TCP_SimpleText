The lamentation of Edward Bruton, and James Riley, who for the bloody murder
committed on the bodies of Henry Howell, and his wife, upon Queens Down, were
executed and hanged in chains, near the same place on the 18. day of March.
1633.
To the tune of, Fortune my Foe.
KInd Countrymen and our acquaintance all,
Example take by this our sudden fa^l,
Dip not your bands in blood that is innocent,
For which offense we both too sat repent.
The crying sins of murder pierces heaven,
And great repentance craves to be forgiven,
One bloody deed deserves ten thousand deaths:
But we bereaved diverse of their breaths.
The harmless man that did no hurt intend,
Most b^tcher-like we brought unto his end,
And that good woman his most loving wi^s
Inhumanely bereaned we of life,
She great with child (oh how it grieves our hearts
That we should act such bloody tragic parts!)
The harmless in^ant that was in her womb,
We likewise slew, whose mother was its tomb.
Their other children sitting by the fire
We likewise hurt, who mercy did require,
But we no mercy had, nor grace at all,
When as these ^a^es for life did cry and call.
And for the same no mercy here we find:
Deserved death are for our s^^^es assigned,
Death is our doom, we here our ^^ues must pay,
Our glass is out, this is our dying day.
A Samelesse end for our most shameful sin
We must receive, that we have lived in,
Here on this tree we must resign our breath:
Yet ^ha^s not all, though here we dis this death.
Our bodies must no but ^all place possess,
This is our doom for our vild wickedness,
Twixt Earth and Hea^^ we here most hang in chains
As lung as (...), flesh or bones remains.
Fowls of the air our eyes they forth will p^ll,
Feed on our flesh, and ^eck upon our s^ull,
We shall be pointing stocks to every one
That passes by, though we are dead and gone.
Earth scorns to hide our bodies from the light,
But in the air must tottering hang in sight.
And here in ^ent we never shall be forgot,
Although our i^in^s by piecemeale dropping (...),
Unto each other Travelers will say.
See you those Murtherets, as they pass this way,
Those are the villat^^es that the blood did sp^^^
Of innocents, that's hanging on yon hill.
Thus shall we be discourse for aftertimes,
Which we deserve most ^ust^y for our crimes,
And we shall be recorded for this (...),
That we so merciless and foul did ^ct.
Great God forgive our sins that are so foul,
And unto mercy take each sinful Soul,
Deal not in Justice with our sins, O Lord,
But grace and pardon to our souls afford.
Thy mercy (Lord) is great than our sin,
And if thou please in Heaven to let us in,
We do repent us of our wicked deed,
The thought of which does make our souses to bleed*
But woe to him that was the cause of this,
Which did iutice us first to do amiss^,
Oh bloody Darbie, it was long of thee
We did consent to do this vilianie.
Though thou art fled, yet God will find thee out,
And will take vengeance on thee, there is no doubt,
He Will not ^et escape so foul and vile a crime,
As he has justly done on us this time.
But we confess, we have deserved to dys,
And to the Lord we now for mercy cry:
Receive us, Jesus Christ, to t^ee we pray,
Whose precious blood wa^^ all our sins away.
Thus have you heard how these same two did dye,
Ending their times with shame and infamy,
And one of them that was on the other side,
Connected, and a Prote^^ant he did.
The Lord (no doubt) to them did mercy ^end,
Who were so peni^ent before their and,
Their souls I hope in Heaven sho^^ (...) dwell*
But yet another bloody sale I^e ^ell.

Another Bloody murder committed near VVare, in Hartfordshire, by some
notorious offenders, who were executed in the same month.
To the same Tune.


KInd hearts give ear to that which I shall ^ell
Of a sad story which of late befell,
In Hartforoshire near Ware did chance this thin^^,
Which caused salt tears from many eyes to spring.
Two men were riding in an evening late,
That had a charge of money and estate,
And home ward they intended for to go,
But destiny does oftentimes say no.
And for these men four villains they did watch,
Which had way^ laid the^ ^ow they them might catch:
At him which was the foremost they did lay,
But this swift horse did bear him safe away.
The vexed they hit, and felled him to the ground,
And ^is^^ng him, they ^a^e him many a wound,
So leaving him, as they did think for dead*
Having his gold, away they streightway fl^^.
Yet one of them did backward cast his eye,
And did perceive him stir as he did lie,
Saying, I Will back, and give him his deaths bla^
For every one of us he well does know.
And with his staff his brains be out did be^fe.
Then straight this villains to them did retreats;
But mark how God did bring this thing so light,
For blood and murder he will soon requ^^e.
One of these thieves a peete of Gold would chang^
With one that (...) to him, that did think it stran^
He should have gold, yet not the vale^ knew,
Into suspicion strait his mind it drein.
And hearing of the murder done of late,
Would understand how he came by this state,
And t^reatning him, he ^he^ ^oufest (...) way,
Both him and them which that same man did (...)
They were conui^ted, (...) by Law were tried,
And for the same all four ^^ the act ^^y di^e,
And ^e that last ^^^^t^ ^^e, did suffer (...),
Just in the place ^e spirit the true man's brea^h.
And at the common Execution place,
The other three did and their (...):
A just reward for murderers ^s their (...),
That bear so base and (...) a bloody mind.
For he that sits above the heavenly sky,
V^ewes all below with his all seeing e^e,
And will take vengeance when he sees his will,
On all that glories harmless blood to spill*
Great God, preserve us from all sudden death,
Prepare our souls before we lose our breath,
Make us all ready for the any to c^^e,
When thou shall give to every one (...).
