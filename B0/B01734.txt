Doubtful ROBIN; Or, Constant NANNY. A New BALLAD.
Tune of, Would you be a man of Fashion, or, Doubting Virgin.


DEarest Nanny prithee tell me,
be so just as tell me true
What hard fate was that befell me
to be slighted so by you:
I that thought your vows so lasting
did imagine no deceit,
But I find all your protesting
to be nothing but a cheat.
But I find etc.
Tell me then thou faithless woman
why thou do so ill with me,
Thou that did protest that no man
ever was so dear to thee:
Though in vain I should persuade thee
once thy promise to renew,
Yet I pity to upbraid thee
that thou art so much untrue.
Yet etc.

Her Answer. Dearest Robin pray believe me,
from my heart I freely speak,
I did never yet deceive thee,
nor my vows will never break;
I did always love you dearly,
and no other man but you,
My poor heart does show it clearly,
that I never was untrue.
My poor heart etc.






Tell me pray why you are frighted
that I should unconstant prove,
Or to think that you are slighted,
or the least suspect my love;
Tell me pray that I may mend it,
if that any cause be due;
I am sure I can defend it,
for I never was untrue.
I am sure etc.
Take this kiss and take my heart too
if that will confirm my dear,
if you think I do not smart too,
will you then believe this tear:
Jealousy indeed may wrong us,
and our sorrows may renew,
if your fears bring that among us,
it is in vain for to be true.
If your fears etc,
Yet my dearest never shall find it
that I e're will prove unkind,
For I never yet designed it
ever for to change my mind;
Since you once believed I loved you,
know I still shall do so too,
Let no jealous fancy move you
for to think I am untrue.
Let no jealous etc.
Dearest Nanny i will believe thee,
And reserve thee to my heart,
For my jealous thoughts forgive me
and we never more will past:
All the day I will embrace thee,
to my fears i will bid adieu,
When at night I shall unlace thee,
thou shall say that I am true.
When at night etc.
But I hope that we are friends too,
now thy patience I have tried:
This i will do for thy amends too
whensoe're you are my Bride,
There Is my heart and there is my hand too,
to all sorrows bid adieu,
All I have you shall command too,
since I find that you are true.
All I have etc.
So they sealed up their indentures
with a loving kiss or two,
Married straight at all adventures,
never Couple loved so true;
So I wish they may persevere
in this happy way of life,
Then true cause she will have never
to repent she was a wife.
Then true cause etc.
