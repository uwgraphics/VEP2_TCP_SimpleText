A light hearts A Jewel. Or, The honest good blade who a free heart does carry,
And cares for nothing but to haue's own vagary.

To the tune of Jack Puddings vagary.


ALL you that merry lives do lead,
although your means be little,
That seldom are o'reseene in bread,
nor take much thought for vittle:
Attend while I Will exemplyfie,
the mind that I do carry,
I take delight both morn and night,
to have mine own vagary.
Though fortune have not lent me wealth
as she has done to many,
Yet while I Have liberty and health,
I Will be as blithe as any:
I Will bear an honest upright heart,
there is none shall prove contrary,
Yet now and then Abroad I Will start,
and have mine own vagary.
No base profession will I choose,
thereby to get my living,
No Kent-street maunding will I use,
my minds more bent to giving:
I will not say I Am this and that,
with bug Bear boasts to scare ye,
Let Coxcombs prate they know not what,
I Will have mine own vagary.
I am no Graves-end Trauailour,
No teller of strange stories,
No forger of Coranto's nor,
a man that evermore is
Extolling of his own deserts,
and with proud words will dare ye,
Let such as these are act their parts,
I Will have mine own vagary.
I am no haunter of the Plays,
to pick poor peoples purses,
Nor one that every word he says,
does coin new oaths and curses:
If I do run on Tapsters scores,
to pay them I am wary,
Let others spend their means on whoors,
I love mine own vagary.
I am no blade nor Roaring Boy,
aboading in they City,
No Whiske, no Lift nor no Decoy,
nor one that asks for pity:
My educations not the best,
yet such a heart I carry,
That what my humor ca'nt digest,
it fits not my vagary.
No City Shuffler scarce of age,
to have what fate has left me,
No haire-braind Ass that is full of rage,
reason has not bereft me:
No great Bum-Bayly that may fright,
my fearful adversary,
But one that loves, and takes delight,
to have his own vagary.
No Usurer that hords up trash,
nor yet a noted Spender,
No borrowing Sharke that never pays,
but to a Friend a Lender:
No Petyfog, nor Common-bayle,
For no such fellows care I,
In honest sort I Will never fail,
to have mine own vagary.
The second part,
To the same tune.




NO Bowling Alley Rooke am I,
that swears all by dam me,
By such I Will not over reached be,
In this their's none can blame me:
No swaggering Pimp that champion is,
to Dole, to Kate, and Sary,
I hate such slavish Offices,
those fit not my vagary.
Those painful Swains that on the green,
do daily take their pleasure,
The pleasant'st life that can be seen,
though not so stored with treasure:
When Husbandmen and Sheapheard Swains,
with Lasses of the Dary,
Do sportingly trip ore the Plains,
O that fits my vagary.
I care not to wear Gallant rags,
and owe the Taylour for them,
I care not for those vaunting brags,
I ever did abhor them:
What to the world I seem to be,
no man shall prove contrary,
My Suites shall suite to my degree,
O that fits my vagary.
I care not for those scarre Crow blades,
whose valor lies in speeches,
That in discourse of manhood wades,
oft-times above their reaches:
If I have not a mind to fight,
I Will urge no adversary.
When word and deed both iump aright,
O that fits my vagary.
I care not for the Broakers Book,
my names not there inrouled,
I nothing owe, therefore I look,
by none to be controuled:
I do not fear the Sergeants Mace,
walk by the Counter dare I,
And look a Bayliffe in the face,
O this is my vagary.
I care not much in company,
to spend what is allotted,
I Will drink but for sufficiency,
I Will never be besotted:
When I do feel my spirits dull,
a cup of old Canary
Will fill my heart with couragefull,
and this is my vagary.
I care not for sad malecontent,
that is the bane of nature,
I love good honest merryment,
and I Will despise no creature:
That's for my use and sustinence,
and still I will be wary,
Least I exceed in my expense,
that fits not my vagary.
Still will I have an honest care,
that none lies wronged by me,
I Will not build Castles in the air,
whoeuer lists to try me,
Shall find in all that's promised here,
not any word contrary,
I envious censure do not fear,
I Will have mine own vagary.
