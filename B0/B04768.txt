The Politic Countreyman.
Plainly setting forth the many misfortunes of those men who have mist of their
aims in choosing a wife, also discovering the vast difference between the
London Mistrisses and the Country Dames.

Tune of, Hey boys up go we, Or, Jenny Gin.






SInce Women they are grown so bad
I Will lead a single life,
Not one in ten there is to be had
will make a careful wife:
Therefore I think it is best for me
single for to remain,
For some are bound and would be free,
but wishes are in vain.
One man he has a scolding wife,
that never will quiet be;
But wearies him out of his life:
oh! what ill luck had he
To marry one whose wicked tongue
does cause him to complain,
But knows not how to ease his wrong
since mourning is ^n vain.
Another has a drunken wife
that spends all she comes near,
And drunkenness often breeds strife,
it plainly does aprear:
And let him chide her all he can,
a Sott she will remain,
And he cannot be freed again,
all vexing is in vain.
Another has a wanton one,
whose lust he cannot suffice;
And good men are too often undone
by such, whose rouling eyes
On all men gaze; as if they could
by looks their wills obtain,
And never will do what they should:
good Counsel is in vain.




Another has an idle pack
that will not get her Bread,
Nor keep good Clothes upon her back,
but loves to lie in bed:
Good Counsel she does still refuse,
reproof she does disdain,
Her friends she strangely will abuse
that checks her, though in vain.
But he that with a Slut does meet
has the worst luck of all,
She stinks as she does walk the street,
her nasty beast they call:
And if you strive to make her neat,
then will she scold amain;
That with her you dare hardly eat,
to help this it is in vain.
Then you that have good careful wives
esteem them as a prize,
Tender them as you do your lives,
or Apples of your eyes:
For it a certain Treasure proves,
and love will there remain,
There Is nothing that their love removes;
all strivings are in vain.
Oh! give to me the Country lass
that loves the Milking-paile,
For she will be constant, and alas!
naught can with her prevail:
She loves the man that drives the Plow,
and sometimes sowes the grain,
He that to her does make a vow
his love is not in vain.
The lusty lad that stoutly Mows,
he loves the Dayry maid;
She Is constant, wheresoever she goes
no wantonness is played:
All looseness she does clear despise.
and looseness does disdain,
The Plowman she does Idolize,
she loves, but not in vain.
Now to conclude, and speak my mind,
pray count it not a jest;
Observe, and you shall clearly find
a Country lass is best:
For she is clear, without deceit,
and constant will remain;
He that with such a girl does meet
his love is not in vain.
