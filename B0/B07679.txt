thou may sone find wherwythe thou shalt be able, not only to cure thine
own wou^des but also to reconforte thy neighbor being fallen in to any
adversity. And morouer to make strong and encoura^ the feebleness of man's
con^ence, with these most dele^^le scriptures of the great mercy of God. For all
consolacyon or comfort of man, shall savor but like in the, after that thou
have ones tasted of this. Thy physician, thy wife, thy parents and friends do
promise y^ nothing but bodily health and put the in hope of longer life, but the
word of god does put the in hope of the life everlasting, and causehth the to
sustain the hand? of god with all pacyence, and to witstande the fear of
death with a bold courage, even as it were with a strong bulwark, wherefore
most gentle reoder, I beseech the to take in wrath this work such as it is,
being bestowed only to thy use, and leuynge al contagyous waters and stynkynge
fylthy pudels that may infecte thy mind with error heresye and sedycyon:
Drink largely out of this vncorrupt and pure well of our saviors the knowledge
of his high me^cy, And in the mean time consider how thou art bound to eschew
those ii. euyls, whereof the prophet Jeremy does speak in this wise* My people
Hiere. 2
have committed. ii. euyls they have forsaken me that am the well of the water
of life, and have dygged out broken c^sternes that can hold no water, but
rather preace thou boldly to the throne Hiere. 5.
of his grace, that thou may obtain mercy and find grace in time of need.

Abide in me, and I in you, for as the branch can bring forth no fruit of it

If you abide in me, and my words abide i^ you also, ask John. 6. Mat. 11.
whatsoever ye will, and it shall be granted you.

All that my father does give me, shall come unto me, and who that comethe unto

My father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that

If any do love me, he will keep my word, and my father will love him, and we
will come unto him, and will make our mansion in him,

If you do love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray unto my Father
and he shall give you another conforter for to abide with you ever moore which

The sonue of man came to save that that was lost.

The son of man came not to leefe so^les, but to save

God did not send his son into the world for to judge. the Ioh. 3
world, but to the intent that the world should besaued vi hi^ He that believes
in him shall not be condemned; but he that does not believe, is condemned
already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotteu son of
God. The father louethe the son and has given him all things into his

He that believes in the son has everlasting life, and he that does not
believe in the son shall never selyfe, but the veugeaunce Ioh. 1^

And if I be lift up from the earth, I will bring al unto me.

And like as Moses did hang up a serpent in wyldernes, so must the son of

For god has loved the world in such wise, that he gave his only begotten

Let not your hearts be troubled, believe in God and believe in me, there be many

For the father him self l^ueth you because ye have, loved me.

And whatsoever ye will ask the father in my name. I will do it, that the
father may John. 18 John 14 John. 16

Ask, and ye shall have that Ioh. 4.

The true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and verite, for the
father sekethe out such yt may worshipe him

Ask, and it shall be given Math 7

Let your loins be gyrded above, and your lyghtes brennynge in your hands.
And ye your selves like unto me^ that look after their master when Luc. 12.
he will return from a wedding.

Take no thought for your living what ye shall eat, nor for your body what
ye shall put on.

The life is of more value then meat, and the body is more of value then
raymente. Mark well the ravens for they neither sow nor repe which neither
have storehouse ne barn, and yet god fedeth them how much more are ye better
then the fowls.

Do not seek what ye may Mat. 6,
eat. or what ye may drink, and be ye not lift an high,
