The Speech of Sr. Harbottle Grimston Baronet, Speaker of the Honorab^^ House
of Commons, to the KINGS most Excellent MAJESTY. Delivered in the
Banqueting House at Whitehall, May 29. 1660. The Members of that House being
then present.
Most Gracious and Dread Soverign,
IF all the Reason and Eloquence that is dispersed in so many several heads
and tongues as are in the whole world, were conveyed into my brain, and united
in my tongue, yet I should want suffici^ncy t^ discharge that great task I am
now enjoined.

The Restitution of Your MAJESTY to the Exercise of Your just and most
ind^bi^^^e ^ative Right of Soveraignity, and the deliverance of Your People
from bondage and slavery, has t^en ^ought out, and brought to pass, by a
miraculous way of Divine Providence, beyond and (...) reach and comprehension
of our understandings, and therefore to be admired, impossible to be expressed.

God has been pleased to train Your MAJESTY up in the School of affliction,
where You have learned that excellent lesson of Patience so well, and improved
it so much for the good of Your People, that We have all just cause for ever to
bless God for it, and We doubt not but Your Name is Registered in the Records
of Heaven, to have a place in the highest Form, amongst those glorious
Martyrs, of whom it is reported, That through Faith (...) Christ, and patience
in their sufferings, they converted their very Tormenters, and conquered those
barbarous bloody ^^rants under whom they then suffered; insomuch as they
themselves were many times enforced to confess, and cry out (...) est vicisti
Galilaeus; they had their (vicisti) and that deservedly: But Your MAJESTY must
have a treble (v^cisti) for with the same weapons, Faith and Patience, You have
overcome and conquered the hearts and affections of all Your People in three
great Nations, the hearts and affections of all that are worthy the Name of
good Christians, or reasonable men.

It Is God, and God alone, to whom be the glory, that has made your Majesty so
great a Conqueror, indeed Your conquest is incomparable, no story can instance
the like, or furnish us with an example to parallel it withal. 'Twas a use and
custom amongst the Romans, when any of their Commanders had done eminent
services abroad, at their returns to honor them with triumphs, and riding
through their streets, there they received the praises and applauses of the
People, with this inscript^^n upon their Laurel Crowns, Vincenti Dabitur; But
your Majesty's victory is of another nature, and as it differs much from the^^s
in the ^uality of it, so your triumph must differ as much from theirs in the
manner of it. They conquered bodies, but You^ Majesty has conquered souls;
they conquered for the honor and good of themselves, but Your Majesty has
conquered for the honor and good of Your People; they conquered with force,
but Your Majesty has conquered with Faith; they conquered with power, but Your
Majesty has conquered with patience; and therefore God himself has written
Your Motto, and inscribed it upon Your Royal Crown, (Patienti Dabitur) their
triumphs were in narrow streets, but Your Majesty's triumph mu^ be in ^^rge
hearts; their triumphs lasted but for a day, but Your Majesty's triumph must
last for all Your days, and after that, to triumph in heaven to all Eternity.

I have read of a Duke of Burgundy, who was called Carolus Audax; the Historian
tells us that his father was calle^ ^arolus Bonus, an Observator has this note
upon it, That goodness does ever produce boldness; Sir, You are the true Son
o^ such a good Father, and so long as you serve our good God, He who is
goodness it self, will give You boldness, a Prince (...) ^ertue; and the best
foil Your Majesty can use to set out the true luster of al Your other most
eminent and lively graces.

Most Royal Sovereign, I have yet a few words more; and to doubt Your Patience,
who in the mirror of ^^t^^^re, were to commit a crime unpardonable, and fit to
be excepte^ (...) that Act of Oblivion which Your Majesty has so graciously
tendered unto Your People, Therefore with an humble ^^^^^dence I shall presume
to acquaint Your Majesty, (...) I have it further in command to present You at
this time with a ^etiti^^ of Right, and humbly upon my bended kn^^ ^o beg Your
Royal Assent thereunto. Sir, It has already passed tw^ (...) Houses, Heaven
and Earth, and I have (...) Populi, and Vox Dei, to warrant this bold demand;
It is, That you^ Ma^^^^^ would be pleased to remove Your Th^^^^ (...) State,
and to set it up in the hearts of Your People; and as You are de^^^^edly the
King of hearts, there to receive (...) Your People a Crown of hearts. Sir, This
Crown has three excellent ^^d ^are properties, It Is a sweet Crown, 'Ti^ (...)
Crown and it is a lasting Crown; for it is a sweet Crown, for it is (...) nothing
but the incense of praye^ (...) it is a fast Crown, for it is set upon Your Royal
Head b(...) only has the power of Hearts, the (...) and (...) is a lasting
Crown, Your Majesty can never wear it out; (...) ^onger You wear this Crown, it
will b(...) for the wearing; and it is the hearty desires, and m^st earnest
praye^^ of all Your Loyal, Loving, and Faithful S(...) You may never change
that Crown, till You change it for a better, a Crown of Eternal Glory in the
Highest Heaven (...) the Lord say, Amen.
