The rarest Ballad that ever was seen, Of the Blind beggars daughter of
Bednall-green
IT was a blind beggar that long lost his sight,
He had a fair daughter most pleasant and brght
And many a galant brave Suitor had she,
For none was so comely as pretty Bessee,
And though she was of favor most fair,
Yet seeind the was but a b^gger his heir,
Of ancient house keepers despised was she,
Whose sons came as ^uitors to pretty Bessee.
Wherefore in great sorrow fair Bessee did say,
Good Father and mother let me go away,
To seek out my fortune where ever it be,
This suit then they granted to pretty Bessee.
Then Bessee that was of beauty most bright,
They clad in gray Russet, and late in the night,
From Father and mother alone parted she,
Who sighed and sobbed for pretty Bessee.
She went till she came to Straford at Bow,
Then knew she not whether nor which way to go,
With tears she lamented her hard Destiny.
So sad and so heavy was pretty Bessee;
She kept on her journey until it was day
and went unto Rumford along the high way,
And at the Queens arms entertained was she,
So fair and well favored was pretty Bessee.
She had not been there one month to an end,
But Master and Mistress and all was her friend.
And every brave Galla^t that once did her see,
Was straightway in love with pretty Bessee.
Great gifts they did send her of silver and gold,
And in their songs daily her Love they extold.
Her beauty was blazed in every degree,
So fair and so comely was pretty Bessee.
The youngmen of Rumford in her had their joy
She s^ew'd her self courteous and never too coy*
And at their comman^ment still would she be,
So fair and so comely was prett Bessee.
Four Suitors at once unto her did go,
They craved ^er favor but still she said no.
I would not wish Gentlemen to marry with me,
Yet ever they honored pretty Bessee
The one of them was a gallant young Knight,
And he came to her disguised in the night.
The second a Gentleman of good degree.
Who wood and sued for pretty Bessee.
A merchant of Lon. whose wealth was not small
Was then the third Suitor and proper withal
Her Masters own Son the fourth man must be,
Who swore he would dye for pretty Bessee
And if thou will marry with me quoth. the Knight.
I Will make thee a Lady with joy and delight
My heart is inthralled by thy beauty.
Then grant me thy favor my pretty Bessee.
The gentleman said come marry with me,
In silk and in velvet my Bessee shall be.
My heart lives distressed O hear me quoth he
And grant me thy love my pretty Bessee.
Let me be thy husband the Merchant did say
thou shall live in London most gallnt and gay
My Ship shall bring home rich Jewels for thee
And I will for ever love pretty Bessee
then Bessee she sighed, and thus she did say
My Father and Mother I mean to obey
First get their good will and be faithful to me
And you shall enjoy your pretty Bessee
To every one this answer she made
Wherefore unto her they joyfully said,
this thing to fulfill we all do agree,
and where dwells thy father my pretty Bessee,
My Father quoth she is soon to be seen,
The silly blind beggar of Bednal-green,
That daily sits begging for charity,
He is the good Father of pretty Bessee.
His marks and his tokens are known full well,
He always is led with a dog and a bell:
A silly o^d mon God knows is he,
Yet he is the Father of pretty Bessee.
Nay then quoth the merchant thou art not for me
Nor quoth the Inholder my wife shall thou be,
I loath quoth the Gentleman a beggars degree,
A herefore fare you well my pretty Bessee.
Why then quoth the Knight hap better or worse,
I weigh not true love by the weight of the purse.
and beauty is beauty in every degree,
The welcome to me my pretty Bessee,
With thee to thy Father forthwith will I go,
Nay soft quoth his Kinsman it must nor be so:
A beggars daughter no Lady shall be,
Then take thy adieu of pretty Bessee.
But soon after this by break of the day,
The knight had from Rumford stole Bessee away
The young men of Rumford so sick as may be,
Rode after to fetch again pretty Bessee
As swift as the wind to ride they were seen,
Until they came near unto Bednal-green.
And as the Knight lighted most coueteousty,
They sought against him for pretty Bessee.
But Rescue came presently over the plain,
Or else the Knight for his Love there had bin slain
The fray being ended then straight he did see,
His Kinsman came calling for pretty Bessee
Then speak the blind beggar although I be poor,
Rail not against my child at mine own door
Though she be not decked with Velvet and Pearls
Yet will I drop angels with thee for my Girl
and then if my Gold wilt better her birth,
And equal thy gold you lay on the earth,
Then neither rail nor grudge yon to see,
The blind beggars daughter a Lady to be^
But first I will hear and have it well known;
The gold that you drop shall be all your own.
With that they replied contented we be
Then here is quoth the beggar for pretty Bessee
With that an angel be cast on the ground,
and dropped in angels full three thousand pound
and often times it proved most plain,
For the Gentleman's one the beggar dropped twain
So as the place whereas they did sit,
With gold was covered every whit,
the Gentleman having dropped all his store.
Said Beggar hold for I have no more:
Thou have fulfilied thy promise arright,
then marry my Girl quoth he to this Knight:
and here quoth he I Will throw you down,
A hundred pound more to buy her a Gown:
the gentlemen all that this treasure had seen,
Admired the beggar of Bednall green
And those that were her suitors before.
their flesh for very anger they tore:
thus was their bessee matched to the nKight:
and made a Lady in others despite.
A fairer Lady was never seen
then the beggars daughter of Bednal green
But of her sumptuous marriage and feast
and what brave Lords and Knights thither was pressed
the Second part shall set forth to your sight
With mavelous pleasure and wicked delight:
depiction of the blind beggar of Bednal Green

Of a blind beggars daughter most fair and bright
That late was betrothed unto a young knight
All the discourses thereof you may see.
But now comes the wedding of pretty bessee.
Within a gallant Palace most brave,
Adorned with all the cost they could have,
This wedding was kept most sumptuously.
And all for the love of pretty Bessee.
All kind of dainties and delicates sweet,
Was brought to their banquet as was thought meet,
Partridge, Plover and Venison most free.
Against the brave wedding of pretty Bessee.
This weding through England was spread by report
So that a great number there so did resort,
Of Nobles and Gentiles of every degree,
And all for the fame of pretty Bessee.
To Church then went this gallant young Knight,
His bride followed after like a Lady most bright,
With Troops of Ladies the like was nere seen,
As went with sweet Bessee of Bednal-green.
This wedding being solemnizal ^^en,
With music perform^d by skillful men.
The Nobles and Gentiles sat down at that Tide,
Each one beholding the beautiful bride.
But after this sumptuous d^e^ was done.
To talk and to reasons a number begun.
Of the b^ind beggars daughter most bright,
and what with his daughter he gave to the Knight.
Then speak the Nobles much marvel have we.
The tolly blind beggar we cannot here see.
My Lords quoth the bride my father^^ so base,
He Is loath with his presence these states to disgrace,
The praise of a woman in question to brin^.
Before her own face here were a flattering thing.
We think thy fathers baseness quoth they,
Might by thy beauty be clean put away.
They had no sooner those picasant words spoke,
But in comes the beggar in a silken Cloak.
A Velvet cap and a feather had he,
and now a musician for sooth he would be.
and being led in from catching of harm,
He had a dainty Lute under his arm,
Said please you hear any music of me,
a song I will sing you of pretty Bessee.
With that his Lute he twanged straightway,
and thereon began most sweetly to play.
and after a Lesson was played two ^o three,
he strained out this song most delicately.
A Beggars daughter did dwell on a green
Who for her beauty may well be a Queen
A blyth boony lass and dainty was she,
And many a one called her pretty Bessee,
Her Father had no goods nor no lands,
But begged for a penny all day with his hands
and yet for her marriage he gave thosand three
Yet still has some what for pretty Bessee.
And if any one her birth do disdain
Her Father is ready with might and with main
To prove she is come of a noble degree
Therefore let none flout at my pretty Bessee,
With that the Lords and company round
With hearty laughter was ready to soun,
At last said the Lords full well we may see
The bride and the beggars beholding to thee.
With that the bride all blushing did rise,
With the salt water within her fair eyes
Pardon my Father grave Nobles quoth she,
That through blind affection thus doteth on me.
If this be thy Father the Nobles did say,
Well may he be proud of this happy day,
Yet by his countenance well we may see,
His birth with his fortnne did never agree.
And therefore blind beggar we pray thee bewray
And look that the truth to us thou do say,
Thy birth and thy parentage what it might be
Even for the love thou bear to pretty B^ssee.
Then give me leave you Gentiles each one,
A Song more to sing and then I Will be gone,
And if that I do not win good report,
then do not give me a groat for my sport
WHen first our King his fame did advance.
and fought for his title delicate France
In many places great perils past he,
Buth th^n was not born my pretty bessee
And in those wars went over to fight,
Many a brave Duke a Lord and a Knight.
and with them young Monford of courage so free,
but then was not born my pretty bessee,
and there did young Monford by a blow o'th face
Loose both his eyes in a very short space,
His life had also been gone with his sight,
Had not a vong woman come fo^th in the night
Among the slain men her fancy did move,
To search and to seek for her own true love
Who seeing young Montford there gasping to ly
she saved his life through her charity.
And then all our victuals in beggars attire,
At hands of go^d people we then did require,
At last into England as now it is seen,
We came and remained at bednal green.
And thus we have lived in fortunes despite
Though poor yet conented with humble delight*
And in my old years a comfort to be
God sent me a daughter called pretty bessee,
And thus you nobles my song I do end,
Hoping the same no man does offend,
Full forty long winters thus have I been.
A silly blind beggar of bednal green
Now when the company every one
Did hear the strange tale in song he had shown
They were all amazed as well they migh be,
Both at the blind beggar and pretty Bessee.
With that the fair bride they then did embrace
Saying, you are come of an honorable Race,
Thy Father likewise of a high degree.
And thou as worthy a Lady to be,
Thus was the feast ended with joy and delight.
A happy Bridegroom was made the young Knight
Who lived in joy and felicity.
With his fair Lady pretty Bessee.
