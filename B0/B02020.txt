WHEREAS the Rebels in Our City of Gloucester, Warwick-Castle, and diverse
other places, do frequently make Incursions into our County of Gloucester,
(notwithstanding We have sent diverse of Our Forces into that Our County for
the security thereof) We do therefore hereby Charge and Command all and every
Person inhabiting in any Town or Village in that County, as soon as they or
any of them shall have notice of the coming in of such Rebels, to give notice
thereof to one or more of Our Commissioners for that County dwelling nearest
the said Town or Village, or to the Governor or Principal Officer of Our
next Garrison or Quarter; which if he or they shall neglect or fail to do; We
shall esteem him or them Persons ill-affected to Us, and the peace of the
Country, and shall cause their Persons, Goods and Estates to be seized for such
misdemeanors. And We do farther Charge and Command all and every Person
whatsoever, not to converse with receive, entertain, or harbor any of the
Rebels, Scouts, Spies, or Intelligencers, but to apprehend them, or discover
to some one or more of Our Commissioners, or the Principal Officer of the next
Garrison or Quarter upon the pain aforesaid. And We do straightly Command every
Minister, Parson, Incumbent, or Curate of every Parish Church within Our County
of Gloucester to read and publish the same on the next Sunday after the receipt
hereof, in the time of Divine Service.
