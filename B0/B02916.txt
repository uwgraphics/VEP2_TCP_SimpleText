THE HIGH-VVAY TO RICHES, OR A Means to prevent POVERTY: CONTAINING A Brief
Description of that Child of CHASE or Lady PECUNIA, Whereunto is added a Brief
Representation of all Idle or Extraordinary Expenses, with all their Amounts to
in the Year: Together with an Exact Table showing how much diverse Principal
Sums (with Interest upon Interest) amount to in several years, after 10. or 8.
in the Hundred, etc. very necessary and fit to be regarded by all Those who out
of a wary Disposition intend to thrive in City or Country.
SHe is a Lady of such matchless Carriage,
Wedded to none, though sought of all in Marriage.
She may be kissed, yet neither washed nor clipped:
And if you woo not wary, soon or'e-slipt.
She may be long, and yet be honest too
To many Merchants, 'spite they all can do:
Who e're atchieves her, speak her never so fair,
She Will not stay long before she take the air.
She Will stay with no Poor man, her state's so great;
A Rich man may her for a time entreat;
She goes in Cloth of Silver, Cloth of Gold
Of several worths, and values manifold.
But when she goes in Golden Robes best dight,
Then she is suspected for to be most light:
She needs no Physic to recover, health;
For she is still current, and as rich in wealth.
Some Irish Lady born we may suppose,
Because she runs so fast, and never goes:
If she be wronged in Name, and ill abide it,
Of all Men, Justice Touchstone must decide it.
He that thus does, and all do thus to gain her,
Being thus achieved, she is but slippery hold,
And still be gone, unless by force you strain her,
Changing her Humor to another mold;
By Pence and Halfpence, and such little crumbs,
Which of themselves so slightly Men do prize,
In time are eaten up those larger sums,
That did not by such petty parcels rise.
Like little drops, that of themselves not feared,
Yet do in time, together so much slip,
That where no danger at the first appeared,
It after comes to bear or drown a Ship.
Thy Pence a Day, that may be saved from wast,
When thou do see in one year their Amount,
Will be by this Presentment held more fast,
And weighed, as Thrift persuades, in more account;
Which unsuspected Thief, that all may know it,
I Will waste but few Lines more before I show it.
The Induction.
HE that makes Conscience of a Venial sin,
Into a Mortal seldom falls in:
He that not slightly passes over one Day,
Throws not in thriftless uses Years away:
He that makes Conscience for to speak the Truth,
Seldom forswears himself in Age or Youth:
Even so, He that a Penny gripeth fast,
Seldom throws Pounds or Crowns away in wast:
As contrary, He that o're-looks those small
And petty Moyeties, easily sinks in all.
A PENNY is a small regardless sum,
Yet may in some time to something come;
Therefore observe this Table, thou shall know
How Great those Littles in small time do grow,
And how with easy steps they do decay;
Those that never reckon Pence, they waste this way.
By the Day. By the Week. A Farthing 1 d. ob. q. A Halfpenny 3 d. ob. o A
Penny. 7 d. o. o 2 Pence 14 d. o. o 3 Pence 21 d. o. o 4 Pence 2 s. 4 d. o 5
Pence 2 s. 11 d. o 6 Pence 3 s. 6 d. o By the Month. By the Year. 7 Pence 8 s.
7 d. q. 14 Pence 15 s. 2 d. ob. 2 Shillings 4 Pence 30 s. 5 d. o 4 Shillings 8
Pence 3 l. 10 d. o 7 Shillings 4 l. 11 s. 3 d. 9 Shillings 4 Pence 6 l. 2 s. 6
d. 11 Shillings 8 Pence 7 l. 12 s. 1 d. 14 Shillings 9 l. 2 s. 6 d.

All which said several Sums may be thus more easily summed up after the manner
of Exchequer reckoning, as follows: A Penny a day is by the year one pound,
one half pound, one groat, one penny. Two pence a day is by the year two
pounds, two half pounds, two groats, two pence. Three pence a day is by the
year three pounds three half pounds, three groats, three pence. Four pence a
day is by the year four pounds, four half pounds, four groats, four pence.


And so forward of the rest, being a most certain and never failing Rule to
calculate what sum or quantity you please.

The mouth of Usury being opened, yet her Fangs not pulled out (as some Jews
were in King John's time in England) but her Teeth discovered, that the
Borrower may beware. To which effect is here (by this subsequent Table) showed
how much diverse principal Sums with Interest, and Interest upon Interest
amounts to in several years, after ten in the hundred, and eight in the hundred.

Admiration.
THat Money should engender thus and breed
Is against Nature, springing from no seed;
Yet see this Usury that is ever running:
Insensibly devours a State with cunning;
It eats deep, and yet no Teeth you see:
It is a Monster sure! what should it be?
In seven years, a term of time but small,
The Interest looks as bigg as Principal:
A forward Whelp like to his Dam or Mother,
And every year bites deeper still than other:
Therefore who e're thou art that mean to thrive,
Forbear that Jaw that swallows men alive:
So shall thou live most happy days to see,
And foenus shall not to thee funus be.
And though this be the Gulf that most men fear,
Yet the other Petty Channels come not near:
For it is all one, the effect so understood,
To drown in the deepest Sea, or shallowest flood;
And therefore to this Ruin if thou haste thee,
All Is one, if first, or last, or whether waste thee.
But if so be thou mean to live ashore,
Through Sylla and Charybdis sail no more.
