On the DEATH and Horrid Murder OF THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, JAMES
ARCHBISHOP of SAINT-ANDREWS LORD PRIMATE OF SCOTLAND.
ELEGY.
It Is none but Bleeding Sacred Tears that are
Admitted in our Sorrows to have share,
On Learned Saint Andrews Urne, none must have place,
But from Divines, right Consecrate with Grace:
The Primate, and the High Priest of our Land,
Murdered and Martyred by Hells Cruel Band:
Assassin at, killed, in such Horrid way,
As may move Heavens, in Night to turn our Day.
The like Martyrologick wits knew never,
Turks, Pagans, Heths, Jews, shamed such Act to hear,
With Pity makes Rocks weep, and Earth to shake
Fearing of Doom-dayes Earthquake to partake,
Bad Omen that Gods Latter Judgment shall
To Albions Sphere before full Time befall.
Her Infamy, Disgrace, and endless Stain,
So nigh the Temple Aron should be slain.
Grave Patriarch, True Prophet, and Grave Father,
Apostle Just, Martyred in one together.
The Breast Plate who of Righteousness did bear,
Aged, Reverend, the Badge of Peace did wear.
Me thinks it s^d, Thy Snowy Head did not
Those Villans stop from Butchering Swords and Shot.
Inhumane Fact, Prodigious, 'bove all deeds,
Can be compared to none but Regicids;
From whose profession (if that I were one)
That Act would, bring me, had I Heart of Stone.
A Jesuitick Trick, no Church maintains,
Save Independent-Presbyterians;
Who has with Romes, this Year wronged Britains more,
By Plots and Murders, than ere heretofore.
Oh! brave Saint Andrews, Massacred, thus dies
For others sins becomes a Sacrifice.
Great Charles grief, to him such loss should be,
In Church and State prop'd His Authority.
At Restoration was chief Instrument;
Restored Religion to her Government,
From Babels-Tongues, Divinity has fred
A Verdent Garland has the Mitre bred.
Philosophy, Theology, in whom
And all Their Virtues strove betimes for room;
Humble, most Courtly, never denied Address
To orphans, Widows, and the Fatherless:
The Mirror of all Piety and Good,
In a Grand, Churchman ever understood:
Was with Sage Council, Justice, Mercy load,
Obeyed King, Loved Country, feared God;
Thy Guiltless Blood, shed by Hells Fiends most strange,
As Abells did, calls from the Heavens, revenge.
Undoubtedly if in their power it were,
Heavens Heirarchie would likeway Massacre:
In Soul a Seraphim placed there as due
Amongst Martyrs, whiles Gods wrath do them pursue.
JAMES SHARP, Anag. A SERAPHIM.
The first Protestant Bishop heard or read
In Scotland for Religion Murdered.
