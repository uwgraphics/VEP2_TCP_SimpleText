The Forced Marriage. Or, Unfortunate Celia.
When Old Fools do a wooing go to those
Who are Young-girls, they Court their cruel foes,
The Old man sees he cannot prevail with tongue,
But finds that young ones, love to sport with young:
He to the Virgins Parents makes redress,
And does the n^mber of his Bags express;
Which takes away her Fathers heart-by stealth,
He weds her not to him, but to his Wealth.
Which being done, she loathes his weak embraces,
And throws her self on Ruinous Disgraces.
Tune, Since Celia's my Foe.







TO what great distress
Without hopes of redress,
I am brought
without Thought
of a better success.
Poor Celia's undone,
And all joys from her gone,
By her Mate
came ill fate,
which poor she could not shun.
By Parents unkind,
And with wealth too much blind
Made me marry,
and miscarry,
against my own mind.
I loved one before,
But they thought him too poor,
They forced me,
and divorced me
from seeing him more.
I have now got a man
I must love if I can,
But I fear
my first dear,
I must love now and than.
If I chance to transgress,
As I shall you may guess,
You may shame me,
not blame me,
for not loving him less.
My Husband's a Sot,
Deformed, and what not,
All Day
He Is at play,
with his Nose over a Pot.
Whilst I sit at home,
Like a poor silly Mome,
Still crying,
and dying,
ti^ my dearest does come.




WHen my fumbler's in bed,
and has laid down his head,
He lies
with closed eyes,
just though he was dead.
Why should he repine,
If I spend store of coin,
to assist
whom I list,
in my pleasures to join.
My friends are all mad,
If at this they grow sad,
Why did
they forbid,
him that I would have had.
It Is a dangerous disease,
A Young woman to displease,
Ill matching
is catching,
and is seldom at ease.
I care not who knows,
Be they friends or false foes,
i will Delight,
day and night,
in spite of their Nose.
By first Love has my heart,
And from him i will never start,
though i am wed,
Yet in bed,
he shall have the best part.
If my father do chide,
And his kindnesses hide,
No anger
nor danger
my love shall divide.
My mother does know,
I have often told her so,
The old sot
I loved not
when he first came to woo.
It Is a thousand to one
That before I have done,
i will deceive him,
and leave him,
to himself all alone.
I Will venture the fame,
Of a scandalous name,
Before
i will give over,
to love one of the game.
I Will be happy and poor,
With the man I adore,
Since fate
makes me hate,
the old Fop that has sto^e.
'Twas the ignorant curse,
Of for better, for worse,
Did me tie,
till I die,
to be true to his purse.
I Will venture my lot,
And get free from my Sot,
Young blood
does me good,
now my spirits are hot.
Let Parents conclude,
I behave myself rude,
Their will
to fulfill,
did my reason delude.
Let each pretty Maid,
Who has heard what i have said,
take care
and beware,
lest by force she is betrayed.
Let Parents provide,
For each daughter a Bride,
That nothing
Of loathing,
their loves may divide.
FINIS.
With Allowance,

R. L'Estrange.
