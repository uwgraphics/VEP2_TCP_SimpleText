I Will make thee be fain to follow me. A NEW SONG.
To its own proper Tune.
OF late a Dispute
did happen to pass,
'Twixt a lusty Soger
and a young Lass,
My Honey and Life
I Love thee (quoth he)
I Will make thee be fain
to follow me.
2.
To follow thee
that is a Soger Dad,
All Persons that know me
would think me mad;
No Battle I ever
did covet to see,
So cannot be fain
to follow thee.
3.
My dear never fear
the hazard of war,
I of my Dear Jewel
will take special care
And from all dangers
will set thee free,
If thou will consent
to follow me.
4.
I cannot endure
your pitiful Pay
We'll never live well
on Sixpence a Day;
By Nature we are taught
to shun Poverty,
I Will never be fain
to follow thee.
5.
What if I Am preferred
by an Officer's fall.
O then you're called Madam
by great and small;
Such things has happened
oft-times we do see.
I Will make thee be fain
to follow me.
6.
I fear then you will lead
a prodigal Life,
Not value you're weded,
and slight your poor Wife,
And probably Love
some other than me,
I Will never be fain
to follow thee.
7.
No, no, my Dear
I Will ever prove true,
My Love I will keep
entirely for you,
A kind loving Husband
I vow I will be:
Now therefore consent
to follow me.
8.
Since this you do swear
I Will deny you no more.
Your Faith and your Honor
lies on this score;
Upon these Conditions
thy Wife I will be:
And now I am bound
to follow thee.
FINIS.
