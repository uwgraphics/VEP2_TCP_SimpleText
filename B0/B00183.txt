Renowned Robin Hood: Or, His famous Archery truly related: with the worthy
exploits he acted before Queen Katherine, he being an Outlaw man, and how she
for the same obtained of the King, his own, and his fellows pardon.
To a new tune.


GOld taken from the Kings Harbengers,
down a down a down,
as seldom has been seen,
down a down a down,
And carried by bold Robin Hood,
for a preesent to the Queen.
down a down a down.
If that I live a year to an end,
thus can Queen Katherine say:
Bold Robin Hood, I will be thy friend,
and all thy Yeomen gay.
The Queen is to her Chamber gone,
as fast as she can wen,
She calls unto her lonely Page,
his name was Richard Patringten.
Come hither to me thou lovely Page,
come thou hither to me.
For thou must post to Nottingham
as fast as thou can dree.
And as thou go to Nottingham,
search all those English wood,
Enquire of one good Yeoman or another,
that can tell thee of Robin Hood.
Sometimes he went, sometimes he ran,
as fast as he could win,
And when he came at Nottingham,
there he took up his Inn.
And when he came at Nottingham,
and had took up his Inn,
He calls for a Pottle of Renish wine,
and drank a health to his Queen.
There sat a Yeoman by his side,
tell me sweet Page said he,
What is thy business, or the cause
so far in this North Country.
This is my business and the cause,
Sir, I Will tell it you for good,
To enquire of one good yeoman or another
to tell me of Robin Hood.
I Will get my horse betime in the morn,
be it be break of day,
And I will show thee bold Robin Hood,
and all his Yeomen gay.
When that he came at Robin Hoods place,
he fell down on his knee,
Queen Katherine she does greet you well,
she greets you well by me.
She bids you post to fair London Court,
not fearing any thing,
For there shall be a little sport,
and she has sent you her Ring.
Robin took his mantle from his back,
it was of the Lincoln green,
And sent that by this lovely Page,
for a present unto the Queen.
In Summer time when leaves grow green,
it is a seemly sight to see
How Robin Hood himself had dressed,
and all his Yeomandry.
He clothed his men in Lincoln green,
and himself in Scarlet Red,
Black hats, white feathers, all alike
now bold Robin Hood is rid.
And when he came at Londons Court,
he fell down on his knee,
Thou art welcome Locksly, said the Queen,
and all thy good Yeomen three.
The King is into Fensbury field
marching in battle ray,
And after fellows bold Robin Hood,
and all his Yeomen gay.
Come hither Tepus (said the King)
down a down a down,
how bearer after me,
down a down a down,
Come measure mout with this line,
how long our mark shall be.
down a down a down.
To second part,
To the same tune.
What is the wager said the Queen,
that must I now know here?
Three hundred Tun of Rhenish wine,
three hundred Tun of Beer.
Three hundred of the fattest Hearts
that ran on Dallom Lee.
That Is a Princely wager said the King,
that needs must I tell thee.
With that bespake one Clifton then,
down a down a down,
fall quickly and full soon,
down a down a down,
Measure no marks for us most Sovereign siege,
we will shoot at Sun and Moon.
down a down a down.
Full fifteen score your mark shall be,
full fifteen score shall stand:
I Will lay my bow said Clifton then,
I Will cleave the Willow wand.
With that the Kings Archer led about,
while it was three and none:
With that the Ladies began to shout,
Madam your game is gone.
A boon, a boon, Queen Katherine cries,
I crave on my bare knee:
Is there any knight of your privy counsel,
of Queen Katherines part will be?
Come hither to me Sir Richard Lee,
thou art a knight full good,
For I do know by thy pedigree,
thou sprung'st from Gowers blood.
Come hither to me thou Bishop of Herefordshire,
for a noble Priest was he,
By my silver Miter said the Bishop then,
I Will not bet one penny.
The King has Archers of his own,
full ready and full light:
And these be strangers every one,
no man knows what they hight.
What will thou bet said Robin Hood,
thou see our game the worse:
By my silver Miter said the Bishop then,
all my money within my Purse.
What is in thy Purse said Robin Hood,
throw it down on the ground,
Fifteen score nobles said the Bishop then,
it is near an hundred pound.
Robin Hood took his bag from his side,
and threw it down on the green,
William Scadlock went smiling away,
I know who this money must win.
With that the Kings Archers led about,
while it was three and three,
With that the Ladies gave a shout,
Woodcock beware thy nee.
It is three and three. Now said the King,
the next three pay for all:
Robin Hood went and whispered to the Queen
the Kings part shall be but small.
Robin Hood he led about,
he shot it under hand:
And Clifton with a baring Arrow,
he cloue the willow wand.
And little Midge the Millers Son,
he shot not much the worse,
He shot within a finger of the prick,
now Bishop beware thy purse.
A boon, a boon, Queen Katherine cried,
I crave that on my bare knee,
That you will angry be with none
that is of my party.
They shall have forty days to come,
and forty days to go,
And three times forty to sport and play,
then welcome friend or foe.
Then thou art welcome Robin Hood said the Queen,
and so is little John,
So is Midge the Millers Son,
thrice welcome every one.
Is this Robin Hood now said the King?
for it was so told to me,
That he was slain in Palace gates,
so far in the North Country.
Is this Robin Hood said the Bishop then,
as I see well to be?
Had I known that had been that bold outlaw
I would not bet one penny.
He took me late one Saturday at night,
and bound me fast to a tree,
And made me sing a mass, God wot,
to him and his Yeomen three.
What an if I did says Robin Hood,
of that ma^e I was feign,
For recompense to thee he says,
here is half thy gold again.
Now nay, now nay, says little John,
down a down a down,
master that shall not be,
down a down a down,
We must give gifts to the Kings Officers,
that gold will serve thee and me.

FINIS.
