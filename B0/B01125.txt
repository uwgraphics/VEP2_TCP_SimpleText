Doctor Do'goods directions, To cure many diseases both in body and mind,
lately written and set forth for the good of infected persons.
To the tune of The Golden age.




IF any are infected, give audience a while,
Such Physic I Will teach you, shall make you to smile,
It is wholesome, and toothsome, and free from all guile,
Which shall breed good blood, and bad humors exile.
Although it may seem most strange,
Yet this is most true and strange.
If any man be troubled with uncomely long hair,
Which on his fools forehead unseemly does stare.
I have a medicine will cure him, to prove if I dare,
Let him take a Razor and shave his head bare,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is a wonderful change.
If any be troubled with an idle drousie head,
Whose chiefest delight is to sleep in his bed,
With glutting his stomach this fully first bred.
Let him fall to his work, and be slenderly fed,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If any man be troubled with a very shallow brain,
Whose giddy apprehension can no wisdom attain,
If he will be eased of this kind of pain,
Strong Beer and hot waters then let him refrain,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If any man be troubled with a fiery hot nose,
Which in midst of cold winter is as red as a Rose,
It proceeds from drinking old Sack, I suppose,
Small Beer and fair water, let him drink none but those.
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If any man be troubled with outrageous teeth,
Which eat up his riches, and make him play the thief,
If he will be cured of this kind of grief,
Let him sow up his lips, and he shall find relief,
And this is a cure most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If a woman be troubled with a tatling tongue,
Whose too much vain babbling her neighbors does wrong
I judge for her mouth its something too long,
Therefore she must cut short while she is young,
And she shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If a man have light fingers that he cannot charm,
Which will pick men's pockets, and do such like harm,
He must be let blood, in a scarf bear his arm,
And drink the herb Grace in a possit luke warm,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
The second part.
To the same tune.




IF a man with false dealing has infected his breast,
Or has no good motion in his bosom possessed,
Two handful of honesty he must eat at the least,
And hate all vain glory, and falsehood detest,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If any maid be sick of the sullen disease,
Or grown out of temper that none can her please,
She must be kept fasting the space of three days,
And no man speak to her whatsoever she says,
And she shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If any man be troubled with a false hollow heart,
To cure such a fellow exceeds my Art,
But yet my good counsel to him I Will impart,
Let him take heed he rides not to Tyburn in a Cart,
For then heel be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If a maid be infected with the falling away,
Which proceeds from a longing desire some say,
If she will be preserved and kept from decay,
She must get her a husband without all delay,
And she shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If a man have an ach in his bones at any tide
That to do any labor he cannot abide,
With the oil of old Holly annoint well his side,
And he shall be cured, this thing has been tried,
And it is a cure most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If a man have a conscience that does him torment,
If it be for sin, then let him repent,
He must be right sorry for the time he misspent,
And drink brinish tears when his heart does relent,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If any man's knees are grown stiff and so sore,
That he cannot kneel down to pray and more,
His heart is right stony, it is fitting therefore
He get grace and mercy heavens name to adore,
And he shall be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
If a man be troubled with excee^ing light toes,
Which will run to Alehouse in spite of his nose,
If he spend all his money his credit to lose,
He shall in close prison be cast by his foes,
And then heel be cured most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
Now you that reap profit by the fruit of my quill,
Give thanks to the Doctor that taught you this skill,
For sure he deserves praise for his good will,
That taught you this Physic your minds to fulfill,
For this is a thing most strange,
O this is most true and strange.
I.D.

FINIS.
