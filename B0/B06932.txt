(...) ^ily in Tears: ^ LEGY, (...) ^ed Death of his Grace (...) Duke of
Gloucester, ^^llace at Windsor, on Tuesday the 30th. (...) ^ar of his Age.
But it is our Sins, makes Fatal Stars Combine,
To snap in sunder England's Royal Line;
Our mighty Monarch, when this News he hea^^
He will Lament, in sad and Brinish Tears;
Such dis^^l News never Touch^ (...)
Here needs no Daubing, Flattery to Paint,
A Vicious Mortal for a very Saint;
No Poets Art to praise him now he is gone,
Who had so many Virtues of his own;
His Youthful Heart rejoiced in Englands good,
And though a Child, for our Just Rights he stood.
Yet while we Sigh, what Fate will have, must be,
No Power on Earth can alter Heaven's Decree;
The Great, the Good, both Old and Young must Die,
A Debt to Nature due, none can deny;
No Heirs to Crowns, can be Exempt from Death,
The Greatest Monarch, must resign his Breath.
Here lies a Princely Body in the Dust,
A Child in Years, yet Pious, Wise and Just;
The hopes of England's Glory and Renown,
Tho not on Earth in Heaven he wears a Crown.
