A Precept to Parents.
These words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart: and thou
shall teach them diligently unto thy children, and shall talk of them when
thou sit in thine house, and when thou walk by the way, and when thou
lie down, and when thou risest up. Deuteronomy. 6. 6. 7.

To children and servants.
Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an
answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you, with
meekne^^e and fear. 1 peter. 3. 15.

TO THE CHILDREN AND youth of Long-Ditton, Kingston upon Thames, and East
Molsey: Grace be unto you and peace, from him which was, and which is, and
which is to come.
LIttle children and youth, I am debtor to you als^, and am taught by John, 1
Ioh, 2 12, 13.
the Disciple whom our Savior loved: to pay this debt by writing. I Dedicate
therefore this little book to you jointly: where in* you my little babes, may
see the mercies of God in forgiving your sins for Christ's name sake; and may
learn even in the milk to know, and knowing to call God Father. Wherein
likewise you young men, may, as out of the Lords armory, have weapons ready
fitted to your hand and use, wherewith ye shall overcome that wicked one. And
if ye receive by faith this doctrine, and let it abide in you, to love it to
obey it, you shall increase your strength; and the better with stand future
assaults, in all of them, being more then Conquerours.

For, in the first part, ye have orderly framed in words of Stripture, the
whole body of divinity, which we are to believe concern^g the Gospel of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, after a familiar way of Cat^chising: no one
matter of opinion mixed therewith, but only fundamental truths; laid down
so that all Heresies-now being, or formerly rooted, or that may hereafter
spring up, as tares amongst the wheat, are cut off; not by human wi^t and
School distincti^ns: but by divine word and holy writ. here you have much, yea
all in a little, yet without obscurity. Here ye have that faith which ever was
held and professed universally in the Church: as will be manifest to the
judicious that are acquaint^d with Scripture, with Councels with the
authen^iq^e Creeds, with the public confessions of christian m^n and Churches.
The truth I dare boldly ^ay, the enemies themselves being judges. In a word:
ye have here the heads of Doctrine, which in every particular in the audience
of the Congregation of Kingston upon Thames, was with fear and trembling
(being part of full three years labors their) discoursed off at larg^;
showing in all and every point, the Harmony of both Testaments, the vntiyng of
difficulties and knots in them, by way of explication, the wiles of Satan and
the flesh, begui^ing us of the fruit of such knowledge and belief in deeds,
while our mouths professed the same in words, the conclusions profitable and
famous which depend upon such prime truths. And lastly, the Instr^ctions,
consolations and reproves which these doctrines afford us, for the reformation
of heart and life.

In the second part, I present you with the rules of holy life, whereby you are
taught as the truth is in Jesus, to put off concerning the the former
conversation, the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,
and being renewed in the spirit of your mind, to put on the new man, which
after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. Here I have divided
the precepts of the Gospel: from those of the Law, to avoid confusion: that
they are distinct is a thing not hitherto heeded, yet (as to them will appear
that consider it without prejudice) most certain. The words of Christ have as
much force to bind, as the words of the Decalogue or ten commandments.

Likewise the voice of Repentance, is no voice of the Law; and so of the rest.
That I have cast them into ten, is not out of any superstition of the number:
nor any conceit of mine that there are just ten, but only to help memory; they
also fitly arising to that number, and ^or ought I see, the whole comprehended.
I have in the margent set two different marks upon certain answers or phrases
in those answers, by which I would have you to take notice of your estate
before God. If those or any one of those graces or privileges be manifest
upon your hearts wrought by the word, which are signed with this sign (...)
being that Angelical mark, Ezekiel. 9. 4.
(...) they prove you actually the children of God. If the sins or kind of
offending be yet found in you which is marked with that mark (...) the first
letter in the word Letzim P^^l. 1. 1. signifying scorners.
(...) you are unregenerated and wicked sinners, and remain such till you wash
them away by true repentance, and Faith in the Lord Jesus.

Take these and digest them thoroughly, yea eat them up; as reached forth to
you from God, though by the unworthy hands of a mean Labourer in Gods V^nyard:
whose pray^r is, that you may increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and man.

them.

Q. Why then is the Commandment given to children and parents chiefly*
