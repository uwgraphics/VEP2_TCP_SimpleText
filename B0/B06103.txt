Regality and Barrony, and other Inhabitants within this Kingdom.
Humbly Shows
THAT there being an Act offered to your Grace and Lordships, for Explaining
the Import of the Words in the Act of Parliament 1693 (anent Communication of
Trade) Discharging all Persons whatsomever to exercise any kind of Trade; which
we humbly conceive did not extend to the Trading in the Native Commodities of
the Kingdom, or to Handycrafts-men following their several Employments, or to
Retailing Foreign Commodities bought from Burgesses of Royal Burghs; The said
Privileges being secured to us by former Laws, no ways Abtogat or Rescinded.
When the said Act was moved, after some little Debate it was laid aside and
delayed. And seeing the Explaining of the said Words is a Matter of Universal
Concern to this Kingdom,

May it therefore please your Grace and Lordships to Call for the said Act,
which lies in the Clerk's Hand, and to Explain and declare your Meaning by the
forsaid Words; that the Leidges may be determined thereanent, and freed from
the Expenses of further Quibbling thereupon.
