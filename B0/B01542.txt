The Beautiful SHEPHERDESS of ARCADIA: A new Pastoral Song of a courteous young
Knight, and a supposed Shepherd's Daughter of Arcadia, in Peloponnesus.
To the Tune of, The Shepherd's Daughter, etc.




THere was a Shepherd's Daughter
came tripping on the way.
And there she met a courteous Knight,
which caused her to stay:
Sing trang dildo lee.
Good Morrow to you beauteous Maid,
these words pronounced he,
O I shall dye this day, he said,
if I Have not my will of thee:
Sing trang, etc.
The Lord forbid, the Maid replied,
that such a thing should he,
That ever such a courteous Knight
should dye for love of me:
Sing trang, etc.
He took her about the middle so small,
and laid her on the plain,
And after he had got hs will,
he took her up again:
Sing trang, etc.
Now you have had your will, kind Sir,
and put my body to shame,
Even as you are a courteous Knight,
tell me what is your name?
Sing trang, etc.
Some do call me Jack, Sweetheart,
and some do call me John,
But when I come to the King's fair court,
they call me Sweet William:
Sing trang, etc.
He set his foot into the stirrup,
and away then he did ride;
She tuckt her girdle about her middle,
and ran close by his side:
Sing trang, etc.
But when she came to the broad water,
she set her breast and swam;
And when she was got out again,
she took her heels and ran:
Sing trang, etc.
He never was the courteous Knight
to say, Fair Maid will you ride?
Nor she was never so loving a Maid
to say, Sir Knight abide:
Sing trang, etc.
When she came to the King's fair court,
she knocked at the ring,
So ready was the King himself
to let this fair Maid in:
Sing trang, etc.
O (...)
your body Christ save and (...)
You have a Knight within your court
this day has robbed me:
Sing trang, etc.
What has he robbed thee of, Sweetheart,
of purple or of pall?
Or has he took thy gay gold ring
from off thy finger small?
Sing trang, etc.
He has not robbed me, my Liege,
of purple or of pall,
But he has got my maidenhead,
which grieves me worst of all:
Sing trang, etc.
Now if he be a bachelor
his day i will give to thee,
But if he be a married man
high hanged shall he be:
Sing trang, etc.
He called down his merry men all
by one, by two and by three;
Sweet William used to be the first,
but now the last comes he:
Sing trang, etc.
He brought her down full forty pound
tied up within a glove,
Fair Maid, I give the same to thee,
and seek another love:
Sing trang, etc.
Oh, i will have none of your gold, she said,
nor i will have none of your fee,
But I must have your fair body,
the King has given me:
Sing trang, etc.
Sweet William ran and fetched her then
five hundred pound in gold,
Saving, Fair Maid take this to thee,
thy fault will never be told:
Sing trang, etc.
It Is not thy gold that shall me tempt,
these words then answered she;
But I must have your own body,
so the King has granted me:
Sing trang, etc.

That ever any Shepherd's Daughter
should be a fair Lady of mine:
Sing trang dildo lee.
Would I had drank the puddle water,
when I did drink the ale,
That ever any Shepherd's Daughter
should have told me such a tale:
Sing trang, etc.
A Shepherd's Daughter as I was,
you might have let me be,
I Would never a come to the King's fair court
to have craved any love of the^e:
Sing trang, etc.
He set her on a milk-white steed,
and himself upon a gray,
He hung a bugle about his neck,
and so they rode away:
Sing trang, etc.
But when they came unto the place
where marriage-rites was done,
She proved herself a Duke's Daughter,
and he but a Squire's Son:
Sing trang, etc.
Now you have married me, Sir Knight,
your pleasures will be free;
If you make me Lady of one good town,
I Will make thee Lord of three:
Sing trang, etc.
Accursed be the gold, he said,
if thou had not been true,
That should a parted thee from me,
to have changed thee for a new:
Sing trang, etc.
Their hearts being so linked fast,
and joined hand in hand,
He had has purse and person too,
and all at his command:
Sing trang dildo lee.
