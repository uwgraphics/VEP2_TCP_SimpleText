A Lovers tears:
OR,
The constancy of a young man's mind,
Although his choice be too unkind.
All you young men who hear this Ditty,
A Lovers tears bemoane with pity.
To the tune of Sigh, sob, and weep.


YOu who have run in Cupids maze,
and on fond beauties vainly gaze,
Attend while I explain my moan,
and think my case may be your own.
Then learn to pity Lovers tears,
for love is full of cares and fears.
The bitter sweets that I did taste,
and borrowed hours consumed in wast,
Makes me my friends with counsel arm
that they in time may shun like harm.
And learn etc.
A curious beauty I adore,
and must though she hate me therefore,
For now I am within the net,
at liberty I cannot get.
Then learn etc.
Ill hap had I to see her face,
unless her heart would yield me grace:
Her eyes had such attractiue force,
I needs must love without remorse.
Then learn, etc.
Her hairs were Cupids chains to tie
me unto her perpetually,
For I must love her, it is my fate,
and be repaid with mortal hate.
Then learn to pity Lovers tears,
for love is full of cares and fears.
I think on her both night and morn,
which when she hears, she says in scorn
If you be foolish, sir, must I
be bound your mind to satisfy?
And thus my sad complaints she jeeres,
for love is full of cares and fears.
She thinks her self too high in blood,
and for to match with me too good,
Fond fool says she, art so unwise,
to think that Eagles strike at flies?
O young men pity Lovers tears,
for love is full of cares and fears.
Such vnequality she makes,
no pity on my moan she takes,
The more I weep, the more does she,
insult over my misery.
O young men, etc.
If I to her a letter frame,
she says she hates to read my name,
And therefore to prevent that pain,
in scorn she sends it back again:
Then learn etc.
If I do meet with her by chance,
my captived heart (for joy) does dance,
But to suppress that joy again,
she turns her face with coy disdain.
Then young men, etc.
The second part
To the same tune.


SHe shuns my presence with have,
then ere one word from me is past,
She Is out of sight or out of call,
and will not hear me speak at all.
O young men pity Lovers tears,
for love is full of cares and fears.
Sometimes unto her maid I speak,
and she my mind to her does break,
Away thou silly fool quoth she,
he is hardly good enough for thee.
O young men, etc.
ThA's she does strive to viliste
my name with hateful infamy,
O note the haughty insolence
of maids in fortunes eminence.
And learn, etc.
Were not a shame it should be said
I wooed the Mistress, yet the maid
I am esteemed scarce worthy of,
what man could bear so foul a scoff?
Yet I with patience take these jeeres,
for love is full of cares and fears.
I would my fancy could dissuade
me from the Mistress to the maid,
But ^ alas that may not be,
if ere I marry't must be she.
O young men, etc.
I wish I could my heart reclaim,
from doting on this scornful dame,
For all my sighs and all my care
are like to arrows shot in the air.
O young men etc.
Suppose she be in her degree,
(as she pretends) too good for me,
In love the beggar and the King,
coequally do feel the sting.
O young men etc.
It is her proud fastidious thought,
that only has this difference wrought
For in a true impartial eye,
there is no great odds twixt her and I.
O young men etc.
Well, if I die as needs I must,
Cupid grant me one boon that is just,
That ere she wed she may be feign
a worse then I to entertain.
O young men etc.
And so farewell thou cruel fair,
come gentle death and end my care,
Kind yongmen learn by my behest,
to love your enemies that is the best.
And learn to pity Lovers tears,
for love is full of cares and fears.
