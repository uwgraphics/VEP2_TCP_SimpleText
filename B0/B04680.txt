Monarch of GREAT BRITAIN, etc.
^^OLOGUE
^, Sir, still Faithful to thy Word,
^nquers more by Kindness than by Sword,
^rs brave with Matchless Vigor,
Mogen, make so great a Figure;
Great Britains only Moses,
Mortal Thirstle with the Roses,
^he Harp in Tune to bring,
^ride of Lillies in the Spring:
(...), poor us, among the Press,
(...), to make this blunt Address.
(...), for as Your Highness knows,
store of Nonsense, else in Prose.

^or as they come by,
(...) Cold Or Dry,

^th Wives and Bairns to greet.
^d Your Highness may
(...) Stipends we can Pay;
(...) if Ye wish us well,
(...) speed reconcile,(...)
Who had great kindness for this Place
You Will move the Duke our Masters Grace,
To put a Knock upon our Steeple,
To show the Hours to Country People;
For we that live into the Town
Our sight grows short, by Sun go down,
And charge him, Sir. our Street to wend,
And Cawlay it from end to end,
Pay but the Workmen for their pains,
And we shall Jointly Lead the Stonss,
In case Your Highness put him to it,
Our Market Customs well may do it
For of himself he is not Rash,
Because he wants the ready Cash;
For if Your Highiness for some Reasons,
Should Honor Lintoun with your presence,
Your Milk-white Poltray would turn Brown,
Ere Ye Ride half out through the Town,
And that would put upon our Name,
A blot of everlasting shame,
Who are Reputed honest Fellows,
And stout as ever William Wallace,
Lastly, Great Sir, Discharge us all
To go to Court without a Call,
Discharge Lard Isack and Hog-yards
James Gifford and the Lintoun Lairds,
Old William Younger, and Geordie Purdie
James Douglass, Scrogs and little Swordie
And English Andrew, who his Skill,
To knap at every Word so well,
Let King seat stay for the Town-head,
T^ll that old Pievish Wife be Dead,
And that they go on no pretense
To put this place to great Expense
^or yet shall Contribut their Share,
^o any who are going there,
To strive to be the greatest Minion,
Or plead for this or that Opinion,
If we have any thing to Spare,
Poor Widows they should be our Care,
The Fatherless; the Blind, and Lame,
Who starve, yet for to beg think shame
So Farewill, Sir, here is no Treason,
But Wealth of Ryme, and part of Reason:
And for to save some needless coast
We send this our address by post,
EPILOGUE:
