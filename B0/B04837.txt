Prides fall: Or, A warning for all English Women.
By the Example of a strange Monster born of late in Germany, by a Mercha^t^ to
proud Wife in Geneva.
The Tune is, All you that love good Fellows.

ENglands fair dainty Dames,
see here the fall of Pride,
Wantonness leave in time,
that God may be your guide;
I was a Dutch-land Vrow,
shining in beauty bright,
And a brave Merchants wife,
in whom he took delight.
All things I had at will,
my heart could with or crave
My diet dainty fare,
my garments rich and brave:
No wife in Germany,
where I in pleasure dwel'd,
For Golden bravery,
my person so excelled.
My Coaches richly wrought,
and decked with pearl and gold
Carried me up and down,
whereas my pleasure would:
The earth I deemed too base,
my feet to tread upon,
My blooming crimson cheeks,
felt neither wind nor sun.
My beauty made me think
my self an Angel bright,
Framed of heavenly mold,
and not an earthly Wight:
For my souls happiness,
Gods holy Bible book,
I had my Looking-glass,
where I most pleasure took.
There was no fashion found
that might advance my pride,
But in my Looking-glass
my fancy soon espied:
Every vain foolish toy,
changes my wanton mind,
And they best pleased me,
that could new fashions find.
Yet all those earthly joys,
yielded me small content,
In that Dame nature had
never a child to me sent:
That makes my heart to bleed,
for which offense to God,
He therefore grievously
scourged me with his Rod.
And in my tender womb,
of so pure flesh and blood,
Created he, strange to see,
a most deformed brood:
That women of wanton pride,
may take example by,
Now they in fashion fond,
offend the Lord on high.
When the babe came to light,
and I brought to my bed,
No cost was spared that night,
to stand me in my steed:
Ny Nurses young and fair,
fit for a Royal Queen,
Gave all attendance there,
as it was daily seen.
Never had Merchants wife,
of Ladies such a train,
That came in gentle sort,
at the hour of my pain:
But when my swelling womb,
yielded up natures due,
Such a strange monster then
never man hardly knew.
The second part,
to the same Tune.
FOr it affrighted so
all the whole company,
That ever one said in heart,
vengeance now draws nigh
It had two faces strange,
and two heads painted fair,
On the brows curled locks,
such as our wantons ware.
One hand held right the shape
of a fair looking-glass,
In which I took delight,
how my vain beauty was;
Right the shape of a Rod,
scourging me for my Sin,
The other seemed to have,
perfectly seen therein.
These women's wantonness,
and their vain foolish minds,
Never contentented are
with that thing God assigns;
Look to it London Dantes,
God keeps Plagues in store,
And now the second part
of this Song shows more,
Grief and care kills my heart,
where God offended is,
As the poor Merchants wife,
did worldly comfort miss:
Strange were the miseries,
that she so long endured,
No ease by women's help,
could be as then procured.
Hereupon speaks the child,
with a voice fearfully,
Mother your wanton pride,
bring this your misery;
Let your life soon amend,
or else the mighty God,
Will scourge your wantonness
with a more sharper Rod,
About his neck a flaunting Ruff
it had now gallantly,
Starched with white and blew,
seeming unto the eyr.
With laces long and broad,
as now are women's bands,
Thus heavy wanton Pride,
first in Gods anger stands.
The breast was plated ore,
as still the Merchants be,
Now as lewd women wear,
to hide Adultery:
Every part, every limb,
had not true natures frame,
But to show to the world,
this my great sin and shame.
From the head to the foot,
monster like was it born,
Every part had the shape
of fashions daily worn:
On the feet pinked shoes,
insteps had Roses red,
Which in silk now is used,
so vainly are we fed.
Thus has my flesh and blood,
nourisht now near my heart,
Puts me now in mind of Sin,
and bids me now convert;
O let us women then
take heed of wanton pride,
Angels have fallen from Heaven
and for that sin have died.
No sooner brought to light.
was this fruit of my youth,
But to the Councel-house
it was brought for a truth;
Where to the Magistrates
in a most fearful sort,
Began aloud to speak,
and these words did report.
I am a messenger,
now sent from God on high,
To bid you all repent,
Christ coming draws nigh,
Repent you all with speed,
this is a message sure,
The world seems at an end,
and cannot long endure.
Pride is the Prince of sin,
Which is our chief delight,
Mankind repent with speed,
before the Lord do smite,
This is my last adieu,
repentance soon provide,
These were his latest words,
and so the monster died.
Great was the fear of those,
that these same speeches heard
God grant all Christians may
have their minds well prepared
With true repentance,
Gods mercy to implore,
That never womankind,
may bring such fruit forth more
And you fair English dames,
that in pride do excel,
This woeful misery,
in your hearts print full well:
Let not Pride be your guide,
for Pride will have a fall,
Maid and Wife, let my life,
be warning to you all.
