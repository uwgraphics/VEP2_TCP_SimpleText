The North-countrey Maids resolution and love to her Sweetheart.
Her Daddy and Mammy she will rather forsake,
Then be separated from her loving Mate:
She sold all her Linen, her Goods and her Geer
And follow her Sweetheart his Snapsack to bear.
To a pleasant new Northern Tune.




AS from Newcastle I did pass,
I heard a blithe and bonny Lass,
Who in the Scottish Army was,
Saying, prithee le me gang with thee man,
Unto a Cavaliero Blade,
As I suppose, her moan she made,
For ever more these words she said,
I Will follow my Cavalilly man,
O my dainty Cavalilly man,
My finnikin Cavalilly man,
For Gods Cause and the Protestants,
I prithee le me gang with thee man.
Sweetheart quoth she, if thou't consent,
To follow thee my mind is bent,
I Will strive to give thee all content,
Then prithee le me gang with thee man;
I Will sell my Rock and eke my Keel,
And after that my Spinning wheel,
To buy my Love a Cap of Speel,
And follow my Cavalilly man;
O my dainty, and.
My Uncle gave me a House and Land,
I Will sel't for money out of hand,
And all sall be at thy command,
Then p^ethee le me gang with thee man:
My Mammy gave me a Pot and a Pan,
My Dady gave me a Yew and a Lamb,
Yet I's forsake my Dady and Mam,
To follow my Cavalilly man:
O my dainty, etc.
I Will pawn my Kirtle and eke my Cowne,
Which cost my Mother many a Crown
And go with thee from Town to Town,
Then prithee le me gang with thee Man:
I Will sell my Petticoat from my back,
My Smock and all ere thou shall lack,
For either Money Beer, or Sack:
Then prithee le me go with thee man,
O my dainty, etc.
Thy company I love so dear,
Then rather then I Will tarry here,
Thy Snapsack on my back I Will hear
And follow my Cavalilly man,
I Will sell off all my Hemp and Pards,
And throw aside my wool and Cards.
To march along from gards to gards,
Then prithee le me go with thee man.
O my dainty Cavalilly man,
My finikin Cavalilly man,
For Gods Cause and the Protestants,
prithee le me gang with thee man.
The second part,
to the same tune:




WHatsoever shall of my self betide,
Where thou shall either go or ride,
Throughout the Kingdom far and wide,
I Will follow my Cavalilly man:
I neither care for dirt nor mire,
Nor marches long my legs to tire,
Thy company I most desire,
Then prithee le me go with thee man,
O my dainty Cavalilly man;
My finikin Cavalilly man,
For Gods Cause and the Protestants,
I prithee le me go with thee man.
For hose and shoes thou's want for nean,
Though the Apparel be but mean,
I's wash thee weel and keep thee clean,
Then prithee le me go with thee man:
Thou salt have cleath to make thee a sark
That every yard fall cost a Mark.
And whether it fall be light or dark,
I Will follow my Cavalilly man,
O my dainty, etc.
Give me thy Musket in my hand.
And when thy Captain gives command,
Upon the Centry I will stand,
In stead of my Cavalilly man:
I Am not afraid of Pistol shot,
Nor Cannon bullets burning hot,
Since that it is my happy lot,
To follow my Cavalilly man,
O my dainty, etc,
Whilst drums are beating loud alarms
I will be ready in thine arms.
To keep my love from further harms,
To follow my Cavalilly man,
In frost, in Snow, in Ball, and Rain,
Ore Hill, and Dale, and many a Flame,
I Will follow thee through all the (...) rain,
Then prithee le me go with thee man,
O my dainty, etc.
And when the Wars are at an end,
That I's return heam with my Friend,
I Will work for means for thee to spend,
Then prithee le me go with thee Man,
I Will buy thee new Apparel gay,
To wear upon thy Wedding day,
Then do not hinder me I pray,
To follow my Cavalilly man.
O my dainty,
The Soldier hearing of her mean,
Was loath to leave her all alean,
And she along with him is gean,
To follow her Cavalilly man:
She vows that he his part will take,
And though her life were laid at'th slake,
She Will rather die then him forsake,
To follow her Cavalilly man.
O my dainty Cavalilly man,
My finnikin Cavalilly man,
For Gods Cause and the Protestants,
I prithee le me gang with thee man.
Entered according to Order.
