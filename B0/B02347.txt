Buxom Joan of Lymas's Love to a jolly Sailer: OR, The Maiden's Choice: Being
LOVE for LOVE again.
To an excellent new Playhouse Tune.
^

A Soldier and a Sailer, A Tinker and a Tailer,
Had once a doubtful strife, Sir
To make a Maid a Wife, Sir,
Whose name was buxome Joan.
Whose name was buxome Joan,
For now the time was ended,
When she no more intended
To lick her lips at Men, Sir,
and gnaw the sheets in vain, Sir,
And lie o'nights alone,
And lie o'nights alone.
The Soldier swore like thunder,
He loved her more than plunder;
And showed her many a scar, Sir,
Which he had brought from far, Sir,
With fighting for her sake.
With fighting, etc.
The Tailor thought to please her,
With offering her his Measure:
The Tinker too with mettle,
Said he could mend her kettle,
And stop up every leak.
And stop, etc.
But while those three were prating,
The Sailer slyly waiting;
Thought if it came about, Sir,
That they should all fall out, Sir,
He then might play his part.
He then, etc.
And just even as he meant, Sir,
To Logger-heads they went, Sir,
And then he let fly at her,
A shot 'twixt wind and water,
Which won this fair Maid's heart.
Which won, etc.
The Soldier being frustrate,
Like Boreas lowdly bluster'd,
And would have satisfaction,
For such a treacherous action,
Done by the cunning Tar,
Done by, etc.
But he aboard his Pinace,
Never feared the Bully's menace,
But lustily he plied, Sir,
Against both wind and tide, Sir,
Like any Man of War,
Like any, etc.
The Tailer holdly vows too,
He Will serve him like a Louse too,
And with his bloody shears, Sir,
Will out off both his ears, Sir,
For stealing of his Love,
For stealing, etc.
But he his end had compast,
And laughed at Bodkin's bombast;
Still pointing right his needle,
He launched into the middle;
She tossed and heaved; he drove,
She tossed, etc.
Then, next, the Man of mettle
Began to beat his Kettle,
And swore, that (with a pox) he
Would thump him and his doxy,
If ever he came near,
If ever, etc.
But still the merry Sailer,
Defied Buff, Brass, and Tailer,
Whilst, in his jolly mood, her
He managed with his rudder,
And right his course did stear,
And right, etc.
