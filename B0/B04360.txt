The Dubbed Knight Of the Forked Order.
OR,
The old wanton Lady as I will recite,
And Son John the serving-Man her hearts delight,
Their doings and actions, if you will attend,
In Meeter, they are by a Poet Penned.
The subtilty of women either old or young,
And what cunning excuses they have with their tongue,
That will play with their Husbands and laugh them to scorn,
Stroke up there brows, and there place a horn.
The Tune is, I am fallen away.


It Was a Lady born
of high degree,
In her aged days
was youthful, yet she,
So youthful was
at threescore years old,
A young Man she esteemed
more precious then Gold:
So old, so old,
so wondrous old,
Till threescore years and ten
Old women are willing
to play with young Men.
This Lady one day
in her Parlor did walk,
Unto her head-serving-man
she began to talk,
She told him his feature
was comely and rare,
Few men that she looked on
might with him compare,
So old, etc.
A Lilly-white hand
fair face and a nose
Hair crisping and curled
his breath like a Rose
Straight leg and a foot
and his body tall,
But that in the middle
is the rarest of all,
So old etc.
Madam he said,
as I am alive,
Unto an ancient Lady
it is a present revive:
It will make them merry
either at night or by day,
And clear every Vain
like the dew of May.
So old, so old,
so wondrous old,
Till threescore years and ten,
Old women are willing
to play with young Men.




THen note what I say
and obey my command,
For I Will make use of thee,
now straight out of hand,
The bargain was made
unto their own Will,
The Serving-man had
and the Lady her fill:
So old, etc.
When the Iig was ended,
the Lady threw down,
Unto her good Serving-man,
sevenscore pound:
She gave this Gold freely,
his courage to maintain,
That he will but Ride
in the Saddle again:
So old, etc.
Then the wanton Lady
to her Knight she did hye,
And like to Ameretrix
she did reply,
That she was much altered,
and she had caught harm,
Why then quoth the Knight;
Lady keep thy self warm;
So old, etc.
I Will send for a Doctor
the grief for to find,
For to ease thy body,
and troubles mind;
I will have no Doctor
my grief for to ease,
But only one Man
sweetheart if you please:
So old, etc.
Let me see this Artist,
the Knight did reply,
O quoth the Lady,
lo here he stands by;
That can give me cure
with a Syrup that he,
Brought front the Venetian
and from Italy;
So old, etc.
How came you acquainted
with your Man's rarity?
Sir, in a sad passion,
being ready to dye,
I dreamed that his judgment
was right I do find,
And his physic was healthful
to old Woman kind.
So old, etc.
And if by the virtue
thou pleasure do find,
I doubt then by Venus
that I am made blind,
I dreamed I was hunting
and pleasure did see,
But a vision mine eyes
much troubles me,
So old, etc.
The Deer did run swiftly,
and Hounds after ranged
And I like Action
most strangely was changed
I though that my lower part
seemed like a Man.
My head like a Buck,
and Horns like a Ram,
So old, etc.
And riding on swiftly,
sweet pleasure to find,
An Oak burst my horns
and his blood made me blind,
The Huntsman did hollow,
and great shouts did make,
and forth of my dream,
I strait did awake:
So old, etc.
I told my fair Lady
of my dream so strange,
Quoth she it is the better
when thy Life does change;
For the Forked Order
the evil does expel,
And being a dubbed Knight,
thou nead'st not fear Hell.
So old, etc.
From the Poor to the Rich,
even to the Ladies Gay,
Young Women are wanton
old Women will play:
And mumble their Husbands
and jeer them to scorn,
And point them a Breaker
and give them a Horn:
So old, so old.
so wondrous old,
Till threescore years and ten,
Old Women are willing
to play with young Men.
