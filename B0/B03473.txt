A good warning for all Maidens, By the Example of Gods judgment showed upon
one Jermans wife of Clifton in the County of Nottingham, who lying in child bed
was born away and never heard of after.
The Tune is, The Ladies fall.


YOu vaintie dames so finely framed
of beauties cheifest mold,
And you that trip it up and down
like Lambs in Cupids fold.
Here is a lesson to be learned,
a lesson in my mind,
For such as will prove false in love,
and bear a faithless mind.
Not far from Nottingham of late,
in Clifton as I hear,
There dwelt a fair and comely Dame
of beauty without Peer.
Her cheeks were like the crimson Rose,
yet as you may perceive,
The fairest face the falsest heart,
and soonest will deceive.
This gallant Damsel was beloved
of many in that place,
And many sought in marriage bed,
her body to embrace.
At last a proper handsome youth,
young Bateman called by name,
In hope to make a married wife
unto this Maiden came.
Such love and liking soon he foun,
that he from all the rest,
Had stolen away this maidens heart,
and she did love him best.
Then plighted promise secretly,
did pass between them two,
That nothing could but death it self
these True lovers knot undo.
He broke a piece of Gold in twain:
one half to her he gave,
The other as a pledge quoth he
dear heart my self will have,
If I do break my vow quoth she,
while I remain alive,
May never thing I take in hand
be seen at all to thrive.
This passed on for two months space,
and then thi^ Maid began
To settle lobe liking and too
upn another man.
One Jermans who a widdower was,
her husband needs must be,
Because he was of greater wealth
and better in degree.
Her vows and Promise late she made
to Bateman she denied,
And in despite of him and his,
she utter^ie defied.
Well then quoth he if it be so
that thou will me forsake,
And like a false and forsworn wretch
another husband take.
Thou shall not live one quiet day,
for surely I will have
Thee either now alive or dead,
when I am laid in grave.
Thy faithless mind thou shall repent,
therefore be well assured,
When for my sske thou hear report,
what torments I endured,


But mark how Baeeman di'd for love,
he finished up his life,
The very day she married was,
and made old Jermans wife.
For with a strangling cord God wot,
great moan was made therefore,
He hanged himself in desperate sort
before the brides own door.
Whereat such sorrow pierced her heart,
and troubled sore her mind,
That she could never after that
one day of comfort find;
For wheresoever she did go,
her fancy did surmize,
Young Batemans pale and ghastly ghost
appeared before her eyes.
When she in bed a nights did lie
between her husbands arms,
In hope thereby to sleep and rest
in safety without harms.
Great cries and grie^ous groans she heard,
a voice that sometimes said,
O thou art she that I must have,
and will not be denied.
Tut she then being big with child,
was for the infants sake
Preserved the Spirits power,
no vengeance could it take.
The babe unborn did safely keep,
as God appointed so;
His mothers body from the fiend,
hat sought her overthrow.
But being of her burden eased,
and safely brought to bed,
Her cares and griefs began anew,
and further sorrow bread:
And of her friends she did entreat,
desiring them to stay,
Out of my bed quoth she this night,
I shall be born away.
Here comes the Sirit of my love,
with pale and ghastly face,
Who till he bears me hence away,
will not depart this place,
Alive or dead I am his right,
and he will surely have,
In spite of me and all the world,
what I by promise gave.
O watch with me this night I pray,
and see you do not sleep,
No longer then you be awake,
my body can you keep
All promised to do their best,
yet nothing could suffice.
At middle of the night to keep
sad slumber from their eyes.
So being all full fast asleep,
to them unknown which way,
The child bed bed that woeful night
from thence was born away,
But to what place no creature knew,
nor to this day can tell;
As strange a thing as ever yet
in any age befell.
You maids that do desire to love
and would good husbands choose,
To him that you have vowed to love,
by no means do refuse;
For God that hears all secret oaths,
will dreadful vengeance take;
And such that of a wilful vow
do slender reckoning make.
