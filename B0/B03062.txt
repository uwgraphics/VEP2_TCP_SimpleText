The Humble ADDRESS OF THE House of Commons TO THE KING
Most Gracious Sovereign,
WE Your Majesty's Most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Commons in Parliament
Assembled, being Highly sensible of the Difficulties Your Majesty has
Undertaken, the Labors you have Sustained, and the Hazards you have Run, in
Rescuing us from Popery and Arbitrary Power, Restoring our Liberties, and
giving Peace and Quiet to all Christendom, Beg Leave to return our most Hearty
Thanks for Your Most Gracious Speech; in which You express so great a Regard
for the Good will and Affections of your People, and have given so Undeniable a
Proof of Your Readiness to Comply with the Desires of Your Parliament: And as
Your Majesty has shown a most tender and Fatherly Concern for the Security and
Safety of Your People; So give us Leave to Assure Your Majesty, That You shall
never have Reason to think the Commons are Undutieful or Unkind to your
Majesty; But that we will, upon All Occasions, Stand by, and Assist Your
Majesty, in the Preservation of Your Sacred Person, and Support of Your
Government, against all Your Enemies whatsoever.

EDINBVRGH, Reprinted by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer
to the Kings most Excellent Majesty, Anno Dom. 1699.
