The Ballad.
On the Bishops

ASsist me some good spright with a hie, with a hie,
Whilst I sing of a flight with a ho.
Of in Auspicious Fowls,
All sillier than Owls.
With a hie trony nonny nonny no.

Nor so wise in time you will see with a ho.
These Birds when they are Installed,
All Magpies they are called.
With a hie trony nonny nonny no.

The platter faced Owl with a hie, etc.
Like a wise sober Fowl with a bo.
Is bashful in the Light,
And preys only in the Night.
With a hie trony nonny nonny no.

In the open face of day.
With a hie trony nonny nonny no.
