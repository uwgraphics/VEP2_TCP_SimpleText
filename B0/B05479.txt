A PROCLAMATION Against the REBELS in Arms in the VVestern Shires.
CHARLES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith,
To all and sundry Our good Subjects, Greeting.
Whereas, by the clear and express Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Our
Kingdom, it is declared to be High Treason for the Subjects of the same, or any
number of them more or less, upon any ground or pretext whatsoever, to rise or
continue in Arms without Our special Authority and Approbation: And
nevertheless, a Party of disloyal persons, disaffected to Our Government and
Laws, who have formerly tasted of Our Royal Bounty and Clemency, whereunto they
owe their lives and fortunes, having forfaulted the same by their former
rebellious practices under the cloak of Religion, the ordinary color and
pretense of Rebellion; Have now again risen in Arms within the Stewartry of
Kirkcudburgh and Shires of Galloway, Air and other Western Shires; and having
in a hostile way entered within the Town of Dumfries, have there and in other
places of the Country, seized upon the persons of diverse of Our good Subjects
and have plundered and robbed them, and others of their Horses, Arms and other
Goods and have done and committed many outrages and treasonable deeds and
attempts against Our Authority, and against and upon Our loyal Subjects: And
We, out of Our Royal tenderness for the Peace and Quiet of this Our ancient
Kingdom, being careful to repress the said Rebellion, and that simple people be
not ensnared by the said Rebels and their Emissaries, and involved in their
Rebellion, and to take off all pretense of ignorance or excuse; Do therefore,
with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, declare the said Insurrection to
be an open, manifest and horrid Rebellion, and High Treason, and that the
Authors and Actors in the same and their Adherents, are and ought to be pursued
as professed and declared Traitors to Us; And do hereby charge and command all
persons, who are in Arms against or without Our Warrant and Authority, to
desist from their Rebellion and to lay down their Arms, and to render and
present their persons to the Lieutenant General of Our Forces, or some other of
Our Officers or Magistrates, within twenty four hours after publication hereof:
With certification, that if they continue in rebellion after the said time,
they shall be holden and proceeded against as incorrigible desperate Traitors,
and that they shall be incapable of mercy and pardon. And We do discharge and
command all Our Subjects, that no person presume to aid, abette, assist,
harbor, resset, or any way supply the said Rebels or any of them, under the
pain of Treason, and that they do not keep correspondence or intercommune with
them, without Warrant of Our said Lieutenant General under the pain foresaid:
And We do expect in this juncture, and do require and command all Our Subjects
to be assisting to Our said Lieutenant General and Our Forces under him, and
being required by him or others having Authority to that effect, to rise in
Arms with all their power, and to join and concur with them for repressing the
said Rebels, under the pain of Treason, if they refuse or disobey. And
further, We do strictly enjoin and command all Masters of Families, Heretors
and others Lands-lords and their Bailies, that they be careful and vigilant
that their Children, Servants, Domestics, and their Tennents and others under
their power, do not break out and join with the said Rebels; Certifying them,
if they be found negligent in their duty, or other ways culpable in that
behalf, they shall be looked upon and severely punished as disaffected
persons, and favoring and complying with Rebels. And hereby We give Warrant
and Command to Our Lion King at Arms, and his brethren Heralds, Pursevants,
Macers or Messengers at Arms, to pass to the Mercatcross of Edinburgh and
other places needful, and make publication hereof: As also that these presents
be printed, that none pretend ignorance.

Given under Our Signet at Edinburgh, the twenty one day of November, and of
Our Reign the eighteenth year, one thousand six hundred and sixty six.
