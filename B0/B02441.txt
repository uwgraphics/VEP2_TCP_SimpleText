The COURTIER
A Milk-white Rogue Immortal and unhang'd,
By fate and Parliaments severely banged,
Without, a Saint, a Devil was within,
He sought all dangers for he knew all sin,
Resolved for Grandeur, and t'acquire Wealth,
Robbed some by force; and others tricked by stealth;
A Wheedling fauning, parsimonious knave,
The Princes favor he resolved to have,
The only means by which he thought to rise,
He shuff'd Cards and slily cog'd his Dyce.
A True state Iuggler could make things appear,
Such, as would please his Princes Eyes or Ear;
Produced false lights his Monarch to mislead,
Which made him from his paths of Intrest trade,
He skreen'd all Villains from due course of Laws,
And from his Prince, his truest subjects draws,
Till angry Senates the Vile monster took,
And from the root the upstart Cedar shook,
Squeezed the Cursed sponge had suckd the Nations Coin,
And made him Cast up what he did purloin.
Then on a Gibbet did the monster dye,
A just example to posterity.
Let favorites beware how they abuse
Their Princes Goodness or the peoples laws,
How they Clandestine methods ever use,
To propogate a base unrighteous Cause,
The princes favor like a horse untamed,
Does often break the giddy riders neck;
On him who for preferments so much famed,
The People often their bloody vengeance wreak,
Let these beware how they mislead their Prince,
Or robe the treasure of a potent Nation*
Or multiply enormous crimes for hence,
Comes hanging often or noble decollation.
