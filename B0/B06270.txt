The True Pattern of Loyalty: Being, The Happy Agreement Betwixt William and
Susan. Or, The Young Squire's Conquest over the Beauteous Damsel.
This Damsel dear, her Love did cheer
when ceased to be coy,
She gave consent, now true content,
is what they both enjoy.
To the Tune of, Charon make haste; etc.

WIlliam and Susan they happily meeting,
straight they sat down by a Rivers side,
Where I discovered these true Lovers greeting
Susan, said he, will thou he my Bride,:
Why should we any longer tarry,
let us in perfect love agree,
Here I protest if I ever Marry,
I will have none in the world but thee.
I will endue thee with Jewels and treasure,
always maintain thee both neat and brave,
There is no Lady enioys greater pleasure,
thou shall have what thy whole heart can crave:
Prithee my dearest do but try me,
for I delight in Loyalty,
Grant me the blessing, and don't deny me,
sure I love none in the World but thee.

NOthing but true love alone I require,
do not torment me with any frown,
I will adorn thee with costly attire,
there is no Lady in London Town
That shall be able to Out-Vse thee:
never was Man more kind and free,
Jewels and other rich Iemms i will buy thee,
for I love none in the World but thee.
William i would have you to leave of your Wooeing,
I have another true love in store,
Why should you thus run on the Rock of Ruin,
is there not many young Beauties more?
Dearest though there be never so many,
this is but small content to me,
If that I ever do marry any,
it shall be none in the World but thee.
For thee i will engage in the sharpest Duel,
e're any person shall me abuse,
Thus in the taking away my dear Jewel,
as long as I have a life to lose:
I am unworthy of thy favor,
if I should then a Coward be,
Loose thee, my dearest, O dye I had rather
for I love none in the world but thee.
Said she, you have made here a large relation,
how you will venture for me the field,
Nay like wise in what a most noble station,
you would maintain me, would I but yield,
Yet you may happen to deceive me,
young men are often false we see,
Susan said he, if thou will believe me,
I love no Creature alive but thee:
Dearest I am thy unfeighned pretender;
what I was first I am still the same,
All that I have I will freely surrender,
to thee, or else I was much to blame:
Sure I can never be so ungrateful,
as to return a frown on thee
There is nothing that I hold so hateful,
than to be found in disloyalty.
The Maidens Reply.

Love, I no longer can stop your proceeding,
this with a trembling voice she said
My heart is wounded, which now does lie bleeding,
of me you have surely a conquest made:
Love is a soft and gentle fire,
which does compel me to agree,
Thou art the man whom I much admire;
now I love none in the World but thee.
Never was creature adorned with more graces,
then his dear darling who was not coy,
And the young Squire with tender Embraces,
in the sweet Raptures of Love and joy,
The which is far beyond expressing,
my loyal lover rhen said she,
No one but thee shall enjoy the blessing.
now I love none in the World but thee.
FINIS.
