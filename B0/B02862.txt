THE Dying Christians friendly Advice
To Sinners all, and every Christian Friend,
This my advice I freely recommend.
And wish them all while they have time and breath,
To make Provision for to meet with Death.
To the Tune of, Aim not too high.
This may be Printed, R. L. S.





YOu Mortal men who vainly spend your youth,
In Sinful pleasure, slighting of the truth,
Repent with speed, the judgment day draws nigh,
You answer must for all assuredly.
Before the Great Trybunal Bar you must
Give your accounts, before a Judge most just,
Whosees what you in secret often do,
Conscience shall witness bear against you too.
How sad and dreadful for you will it be,
When you Launch forth into eternity;
Except the Lord his anger does abate,
And Jesus Christ does prove your advocate.
Mind well my words you sinful creatures all,
And to JEHOVAH do for mercy call:
While you have breath of God for mercy crave,
For there is no repentance in the grave.
And yet how boldly men run on in Sin,
That they so many years have lived in,
Like perfect Heathens many people live,
As if they never were account to give.
Whoredom, and drunkenness is all a mode,
Although to Hell it is the ready Road:
And yet securely some do walk therein,
As if it were a precept, and no Sin.
But 'twill be heavy at the latter day,
If then they do in vain for pardon pray;
If to befriend you Christ should then deny,
Your Souls are lost to all eternity.
Then call upon Thrifts ever blessed name,
To save you from that everlasting flame;
Where Fiends and Devils do for ever fry?
And must endure their endless misery.
Then labor to obtain Eternal life,
Twixt God and your poor Souls never make a st^
Thrice happy without doubt or fear is he,
Who proves in his dear favor for to be.
But man is prone to sin, and is so trail,
That over him temptations do prevail:
Which to the Soul gives such a deadly wound,
That Soul and body still in Sin are drowned.
Damming and sinking are so common grown,
The like before this age was never known,
Inhumane murders frequently we see;
Some men of late like Butchers seem to be.
Yet drowzy Sinners never will awake,
Nor yet by others will a warning take;
For time does slide and swiftly pass away,
One hour or minute for no man will stay.
O pity take on your immortal Soul,
Least when it is too late you do condole,
Though Christ a while in mercy does forbear,
Consider well you dreadful Sinners are.
And on his name if you sincerely call,
Begging his help to bring you out of thrall;
There is no doubt but he your friend will be,
And help you out of all your misery.
On Jesus Christ let all your hopes depend,
And he will prove your Savior in the end,
From pains and sorrows he will set you free,
With Saints and Angels you shall happy be.
This momentary life is little worth,
That nothing else but misery brings forth:
O who would praise so vain a thing as this,
To be deprived of eternal Bliss.
With contrite hearts upon our Savior call,
For doubtless he has Love in store for all;
And certainly forever will be kind,
To those that he true penitents does find.
All you that to my Song now lend an ear,
Pray bear in mind the words that you do hear;
Your Sins repent, to God for mercy pray,
And be prepared for the Tr^bunal Day.
FINIS.
