A most rare and true report, of such great tempests, strange sightes, and
wonderful accidents, which happened by the providence of God, in
Herefordshire, at a place called the Hay, and there abouts, besides the sightes
of strange Fowls, which there were seen, most fearful to behold, with
their horrible cries and strangenes, with the great hurt was done by them.

Math. 3. Amend your lives, for the kingdom of God is at hand.


IF beloved, the sundry and manifold examples of Gods indignation powered upon
us, which we through our intolerable heaps of iniquities have deserved be
extinct, and that through his own intyre mercy and unspeakable clemency
withdrawing his heavy displeasure, from our heads, we become forgetful of his
goodness sleeping in sin, drencht in the depth of our desires, and wallowing
in iniquities. Let this rare and wonderful spectacle of our utter decaie, and
ruinous subversion be an admonition, a caveat, yea and an alarm to awake us
from our sinful and sluggish sleeping, least the condign wrath of our Lord and
savior come upon us before we be aware, but unawares we cannot account it, in
so much as he sends, gives, and shows innumerable signs of his heavy
displeasure even in a moment to fall upon us, as well in other signs as in this
sight, the very report whereof but little read, and lightly regarded, may be
sufficient to reclaim the most sinful, and hard hearted creature.

On Saturday being the 25. of September, last past, at the Hay in Herefordshier
was seen so rare a sight as neither our forefathers have known, nor we our
selves heard of. For there arose suddenly a most wonderful and cruel tempest,
with such abundant high waters, that the whole country was not only greatly
amazed therewith, but also in danger of drowning: besides the loss of great and
plenteous store of Corn and Cattle, wherewith they were endued: at which
instant there appeared also a most wonderful and dreadful sight of two great
clouds, the one being black, which arising, issued from the North the other
being white, came from the South part, which meeting together seemed, to rend
the Sky with their rattling, in such unusual sort, that it brought a most rare
and terrible terror to the beholders. In the midst of which clouds,
opposite with the earth did visibly appear, there situated a fair green
Field, as it had been of feirne, in which field dispersed was seen flying an
innumerable company of black Crows, and other Fowls which continuing a
certain time, sent forth most dreadful strange and wonderful cries, no
less rare to be recited then lamentable to regard: being in altitude to the
judgment of the beholders not above 30. fadomes from the earth: with a very
obscure and dark continuance: and not long before the vanishing of these
clouds, was heard so rare and horrible roaring (as if it had been) the cries
of bears and lions: yea and that so terrible that it was rather judged to have
been the skritching of some maleuolent hellish and furious fiends: these
presupposed Crows were of diverse credible persons visiblye seen to rent and
tear whole houses, barnes, and stables, yea and to pull out whole and huge
trees by the roots, in a most rare and wonderful manner ransacked and
dispersed into diverse places, yea and after a most dreadful sight some of
the rafters and pieces thereof, were carried up into the air, and after that
never since seen, with great store of corn which at that time was carried
away: Likewise such hauoke made, of trees that had stood a long time, as would
almost exceed a truth to be spoken of, some were pulled up by the roots and
cast a bow shot from the place, other some cut as it had been with an axe or
saw, and other some so straungely writhen as the like has not been seen of
our forefathers nor hard of our selves. Moreover, and besides all this, was seen
a most rare and terrible stratagem and perfect pattern of our impiety, for the
which unless speedy and suppliant prayers be lifted up unto our Lord, that it
may please him of his infinite goodness and mercy, to be favorable unto us,
we are and shall be in danger of his heavy displeasure: from the which God
for his infinite goodness and mercies sake deliver us: At that instant I say
beloved, there was seen of diverse credible persons a most huge, great and
ugly black dog, who running along in the presence of many beholders, rent,
toare, and pulled up whole trees by the roots, most wonderful to look upon,
which did so amaze and terrify the inhabitants there about, that they expected
nothing else, but that doleful and dismal day of Doom, I mean the coming of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which no doubt nether is nor can be far off.
Many other rare and great tempests about that time were seen in Deuonshier and
diverse other places: the very rumor whereof may of it self without further
witness, be sufficient to withdraw us from our most obstinate, sinful, and
wicked lusts and determinations, whereby we heap upon our heads the heavy
wrath and indignation of our Savior Christ, who I say (beloved) except we
speedily repent and call for grace, the multitude of our sins daily increasing
more and more, will suffer his wrath to fall upon us. Look how far the East
is from the West, so far has he set our sins from us, to thend we might
repent and sin no more, yea even as a father pittieth his own children, so
has he compassion on us, and favorably admonishes us by diverse examples of
his indignation, to abolish these our manifold sins: In so much as with
Jerusalem by diverse and sundry tokens he has manifested his fatherly
clemency unto us: yea even as a hen gathers her Chickins under her wings,
so would he have called us and we would not: Verily beloved, the men of
Niniuie repented at the preaching of Jonas with ashes and sackcloth, and turned
unto the Lord, who had pity and compassion on them: The Queen of the South
shall arise against us in judgment, for she came to hear the wisdom of
Solomon, and we have greater then Solomon, or Jonas, when the Lord himself
admonishes us by earth quakes, comets, and signs in the air: the very
Turks, Panims, and Infidels, will arise in judgment against us, who no doubt,
had they known the Lord God, or the multitude of examples that we have seen,
would have bin converted. Let us I say repent, be watchful, and vigilant that
our Lord and savior coming (like good stewards) we may make account of our
lives, and be ready for the coming of our father, when he shall descend in
his glorious majesty to judge both the quick and the dead: and when he shall
say come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom which is prepared for
you from the beginning of the world, that then I say we may appear al
righteous before him to ascend with him into his glorious majesty, there to
live and remain with him and the father in glory world without end.

FINIS.
