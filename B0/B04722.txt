A Pleasant New BALLAD: Being a merry Discourse between a Country Lass and a
young Tailor: SHEVVING
How the Tailor lost his plight and pleasure
His Yard not being, by the Standard, Measure.
To a pleasant New Tune, or Kester Crab.




IN Harvest-time I walked
hard by a Corn-Close side;
I hearing people talk,
A looked about, and spied
A Young man and a maid,
together they did lie;
When you hear it told,
you will laugh full heartily.
She was as buxsome a Lass
as any in our Town;
She will not let you pass,
but she will call you, to sit down.
A Tailor passing by,
she hit him on the heel,
You are very welcome Sir,
to sit you down and feel.
What money's in my Purse,
at your command shall be,
If you will go along
to Marson wake with me.
He hearing her say so,
and seeing her to smile,
Was charmed with her, so
he sat him down a while.
And having groped her Purse,
and taken all her money,
He grop'd again, and mist,
and caught her by the Coney.
Where am I now? (quoth he)
another I have found,
Its not the same, quoth he,
for this is tufted round.
If it be tufted round, quoth she,
there is good reason for it,
There is such treasure lies,
will make a Tailor sport.




He hearing her say so,
being a frollicksome Lad,
Was willing for to know
more of the fringed bag.
With that he eagerly
to feel put forth his hand;
Nay, hold good Sir, said she,
go not before you stand:
Except you take your Yard,
the depth of it to measure,
You Will find the Purse so deep,
you will hardly come to the treasure.
He hearing her say so,
it put him to a stand;
She seeing him dismayed,
she took his Yard in hand:
Is this your Yard, quoth she,
is this your Tailors measure?
It is too short for me,
it is not Standard-Measure.
The Tailor being abashed,
she told him that it was
More fitter for a man,
than such a penny Ass.
She bids him now be gone,
since he could make no sport,
And said, thou art too dull
to enter such a fort.
She looking fiercely at him,
she said, thou sneaking fool,
Go straight away to Vulcan,
and let him mend thy tool:
And tell him that Dame Venus
at him is almost mad,
For sending to her School
such an unfit Lad.
You Tailors that attempt
fringed bags to measure,
Be sure your Yards be sealed,
and full Standard-Measure.
