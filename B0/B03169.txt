AN ELEGY ON THE Death of His Sacred Majesty KING CHARLES the II. OF BLESSED
MEMORY.
UNwelcome News! White Hall it is Sable Wears,
And each Good Subject lies dissolved in Tears!
Justly indeed; for CHARLES is Dead the Great!
(Who can so much as such great Griefs repeat?)
King CHARLES the Good, in whom that Day there fell
More then one Tribe in this our Israel!
Ah! Cruel Death! we find thy Fatal Sting,
In Losing Him that was so Good a KING:
A KING so Wise, so Just, and He Had great part.
In SOLOMON'S Wisdom, and in DAVID'S Heart:
A KING! whose Virtues only to Rehearse,
Rather requires a VOLUMN then a VERSE.
Sprung from the Loins of Charles of Blessed Fame,
A Worthy SON of His Great FATHERS Name:
His Parents and His Grandsires Virtues, He,
As H'did their Crown, enjoyed ex Traduce,
Of the Best and Greatest of KINGS, the Epitome.
His Justice such, as none could Him Affright,
From doing to all, to God and Subjects Right.
Punish He could, but like He'vens Majesty,
Would that a Traitor should Repent, not Dye.
His Prudence to the LAWS due Vigor gave,
He saved Others, and Himself did save.
His Valor and His Courage, Write who can?
B'ing a Good Soldier e're he was a Man:
Wrestling with Sorrows in a Land Unknown,
Whilst Herod did Vsurp His Royal Throne:
Banished His Native Country every Day,
Like Moses, at the Brink of Death He lay:
But that Storm's over, and Blessed be that Hand
That gave Him Conduct to His Peaceful Land,
Where this Great KING the Gordion Knot Unties
Of Heavens, the Kingdoms, and His Enemies;
Not with the Sword, but with His Grace and Love,
Giving to those their Lives that for His strove.
Never did Person so much Mercy Breath,
Since our Blessed Savior's, and His Father's Death.
In fine, His Actions may our Pattern be,
His Godly Life, the Christian Diary.
But now He Is Dead, alas! our David's gone,
And having Served His Generation,
Is fallen Asleep; That Glorious Star's no more,
That the English Wisemen led unto the Shore
Of Peace, where Gospel-Truth's Professed,
Cherisht within our Pious Mothers Breast,
And with Protection of such KINGS still Blessed:
Blessed with His Piety, and the Nation too,
Happy in h's Reign, with Milk and Honey flew:
Yea, Blessed so much with Peace and Natures store,
Heaven could scarce give, or We desire no more:
But yet, alas, He Is Dead! Mourn England, Mourn,
And all your Scarlet into Sackcloth turn:
Let Dust and Ashes with your Tears Comply,
To Weep, not Sing, His Mournful Elegy:
And let your Love to Charles be shown hereby,
In rendering James your Prayers and Loyalty.
Long may Great JAMES these Kingdoms Scepter Sway,
And may His Subjects lovingly Obey;
Whilst with Joint Consort, all agree to Sing,
Heaven Bless these Kingdoms, and God Save the KING.
Entered according to Order.
