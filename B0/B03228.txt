AN ELOGIE On the Deplorable Death of the Right Honorable Margaret Countess of
Rothes. Who Departed this Life the 22d. August 1700.
Now the most Fragrant Flower of Femal Kvnde,
In this our Age, falls, scarce is left behind,
Or may her Parallel for Piety,
Pregnant Patience, and Christian Charity:
Her Noble Actions made her Virtues known,
And to Posterity they ought to be shown,
For Piety and Charity always did
Attend each Motion of her Sp'rit which hid,
Could no ways be, when those who timely were
Objects of Charity applied to her,
The Widows Reli^ff, and the Orphans stay.
To the Disc^n^olat she was always
A timely support; So that her Worth and Fame,
Throughout all Ages her. Virtues shall proclaim.
A tender Mother, and a Loveing Wife;
Yea truly Chest in every step of Life,
Inclynd to Virtue in all things that might tend
To the Advantage of her dearest Friend,
Constant Affection, Inviolable Love,
Did to her Noble Consort allways prove,
Her Chastity to him to be sincere
Dureing her Weddlock Bonds, and since they were,
Dissolved by Death to're Noble Offspring she,
And others of her Sex for piety;
And Virtue has allways a Matron been,
That non her to Excel was ever seen:
For as she was most Noble by her Birth:
So far more Noble was she for her worth;
That all who know her Actions must Confess:
No Tongue or pen is able to Express,
The great Renown the memory of her Name,
Does still Deserve, for Everlasting Fame,
Shall it Proclaim to Future Ages, That
Posterities her praise may Celebrate.
From time to time, while time does Remain,
Until the World dissolve, and her Soul come again.
Which is ascended I presume to Rest.
Into Eternal joys, with those are blessed;
For Piety and Virtue did attend,
All the actions of her Life unto the End.
