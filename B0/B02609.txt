The Case of several of the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, and Band of Yeomen of
the Guard, Servants to King Charles the Second, humbly offered to the
Honorable House of Commons.
THAT the Parliament in the late Reign, by an Imposition upon Tobacco and
Sugar, raised a Sum of Money for paying the Wages or Sallaries due to the
Servants of the late King Charles the Second. That there were several Payments
made in the late King's Reign, but a great part of the said Salleries or Wages
remained unpaid; but since their present Majesty's happy Accession to the
Crown, that Fund was appropriated, all except Sixty Thousand Pounds to other
Uses, which Sixty Thousand Pounds fell short of Payment of what was intended to
be paid the said Servants by the former Act.

That there is also due to your Petitioners, several Wages and Sallaries from
his late Majesty King James, all which appears in the Account annexed to the
said Petition; And whereas your Petitioners, and many others in the same
Employments, in the present Reign are turned out of their places which they
purchased, to the ruin of many Families, without receiving what was and is
still due and oweing to them, though they never were charged with any
inqualification, or other matter or thing which in any wise did or does render
them incapable for the Offices or Employments they were in.

The equity of all which is humbly offered to the Consideration of this
Honorable House.
