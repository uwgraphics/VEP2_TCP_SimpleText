AN ELEGY On the Death of Mr. William Dunlop Principal of the University of
Glasgow.
-- Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis?

MUst we now our Ideas thus employ,
Ah's Death lament in stead of Joy:
Sader's our State than when scarce Aeneas,
To Dido could tell's Ideas;
Even worse then when to Jacob 'twas told,
Rent Joseph is, whereas but Sold.
WE ought therefore his Praises to resound,
In Thousands since his Match is not found.
Lo He like Holy Lot, his Time spent here,
Loving his GOD, and Him did fear:
In Preaching He, like Luther was a Star,
Any Convincing that did Err;
Moses for Meekness, Aaron in his Speech,
DEspising Ill, and well did Teach,
Uriah's Sp'rit, in Him did ly of Gold,
None so Precious to be Sold:
Like Joseph for's Parts, the KING did'm Promote,
Over passing many in his Coat.
Placed by the KING, the College to Govern,
PIety to Plant, did Discern:
Rightly, yea, by our Lords, He was Elect'd,
In Speed cur Trade for to direct.
None could, so well with Peace Debates agree,
Concerning Gentlemen, as did He.
In Nestor's Age, His Equal was, I don't believe,
Paul like He was, when here He did survive,
All His rare Virtues, I cannot Rehearse,
Lowing my Sails, I end my Verse.
Mors ultima linea Rerum.
