The Lawyers Plea, In the behalf of Young TOM of LINCOLN. Being an Answer to a
late Scandalous Ballad, Entitled, Merry News from Lincoln's Inn. Adrest to the
Author of the said Ballad, by Tom of Lincoln.
To the Tune of, Help Lords and Commons, etc.


LOrd help us all! what Story's this,
that makes so great a stir?
Forsooth who ever keeps a Miss,
must fear this barking Cut;
As if no place but Lincoln's Inn,
did harbor she destroyers,
With Puritans he might begin,
they wench as well as Lawyers:
You Nonconformist- crop-ears, peace,
and rail not against Wenchers,
With you, Fanatic Babes increase,
far more than with the Benchers.
Thou who want judgment talk of it,
like a vile canting Varlet,
And exercisest thy No-wit
against an honest Harlot,
Out of our house should she depart,
she will learn to be more fickle,
Lifting up whorish eyes with Art,
at zealous Conventicle.
You, etc.
She went up stairs thou say at ten,
and what of that you Tony,
At twelve the learned of your men
tip'd over the Balcony:
To this so strange a sight there came
a hundred pious sticklers,
But all went off again with shame,
like crop-ear'd Conventiclers:
You, etc.
It seems he called himself a Cat,
and would have been a gibing,
Her husband understanding that,
came in and spoiled his nibing:
Says he, Cats fall upon their feet,
when downwards they are tumbled,
So down he threw him in the street,
till his proud flesh was humbled:
You, etc.
But for the wench and Laundress Ruth,
I must confess the story,
That there was something in it of truth,
but all is for our glory:
We keep the Child we have begot,
and able are to bear it,
Whilst others, do, or do it not,
are ready to forswear it:
You, etc.
Is not this better than to go
at night to the Peatches,
Reeling and rambling to and fro,
in danger of the Watches:
And meet at last a drab or so,
with Petticoats bedagled,
Or with a pocky Barren-doe,
that from the Park has stragled:
You, etc.
VVoe and alas! your Rudder's spoiled,
I pity your mishap,
And though you get not her with child,
you get your self with clap:
Then you go home and curse the whore,
with all her Art-full dry-blows,
Finding one pox to cost you more,
than keeping twenty by-blows:
You Nonconformist- crop-ears, peace,
and rail not against VVenchers,
With you, Fanatic Babes increase,
for more than with the Benchers.
Thus you abroad with hazard roam,
to find out Harlots fulsome,
While we more safely prey at home,
upon a Girl that is wholesome:
Look to your selves, your case is worse,
dry up your slubbring Ink-horn,
I Will warrant you we will find a Nurse,
for our young Yom-a-Lincoln;
You, etc.
A Bencher's Grandchild! you mistake,
you silly Rogue, I scorn ye,
If a Lawyers Son a Lawyer makes,
his Bastard's an Attorney:
And thus our Tom in little time,
shall grow to be our Brother,
As a Bawds Daughter whores betime,
to enrich her greasy Mother;
You, etc.
As for the woman, I confess
we wrapped her in a Gown,
And whosoever had done less,
had been an arrant Clown;
For being to be called to the bar,
and turn a female pleader,
'Twas reason we should have a care,
she should not shame our Reader;
You, etc.
Long may she live a merry crack,
brisk, airy, gay, and fruitful,
She never any thing shall lack,
so long as she is youthful:
Grown old, her Daughters shall turn up,
to please our youthful VVenchers,
As when we have eat our Commons up,
we fall upon our Trenchers;
You, etc.
As for young Tom I doubt is not,
he will make some Learned spark,
More wit he has already got,
then an Attourneys Clerk;
Before that ever he could speak,
he su'd for Alimony,
Instead of Mothers-milk, he would take
no Liquor but Stipony;
You, etc.
Then blame not us of Lincoln's Inn,
for what has happened to us,
Such wenching is a gainful sin,
that never will undo us;
For we shall keep the bantling cheap,
among so many purses,
Like Citizens that take a leap
amongst their Country Nurses.
God bless the King and Queen, likewise
the House of Lords and Commons,
But truly we shall never despise
some thing that is a woman's,
For should she Laws cart every one,
that loves a little cracking,
The City would be quite undone,
their Wives must all be packing.
FINIS.
