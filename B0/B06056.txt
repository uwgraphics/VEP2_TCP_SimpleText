The Scotch Lover's Lamentation: OR, GILDEROY's Last FAEWE.
To an excellent new Tune, much in request.
Licensed according to Order.

GIlderoy was a bonny Boy,
had roses tull his shun,
His Stockings made of the finest silk,
his Garters ha^ging down:
It was a comely sight to see,
he were so trim a Boy;
He was my J^y and Heart's Delight,
my handsome Gilderoy.
Oh, sike a charming Eyes he had,
a breath as I^ve t^as Rose,
He never wore a Highland plad,
but costly silken Clothes:
He gained the love of Ladies gay,
there is none to him was coy;
Ah way's me, Ise mourn this Day
for my dear Gilderoy.
My Gilderoy and I was born
both in one Town together,
Not passing seven Years ago,
since one did love each other:
Our Daddies and our Mammies both,
were clothed with mic^le joy,
To think upon the Bridal-day,
betwixt I and my Gilderoy.
For Gilderoy, that Love of mine,
gued faith Ise freely bought
A weddin^ ^ark of Holland fine,
with silken flowers wrought;
And he gave me a wedding-ring,
which I received with joy;
No Lads or Less e're could sing,
like my sweet Gilderoy.
In mickle joy we spent our time,
till we was both fifteen,
Then gently he did lay me down,
amongst the leaves so green;
When he had done what he could do,
he rose and gang'd his way,
B^t ever since I loved the Man,
my bandsom Gilderoy
While we did both together play,
he kissed me over and over;
Gued fairh it was as blithe a day,
as e're I saw before;
He filled my heart in every vein,
with love and mickle joy;
But when shall I behold again,
mine own sweet Gilderoy?
It Is pity Men should e're be hanged,
that takes up Women's geer,
Or for their pelfering sheep or calves,
or stealing cow or mare;
Had not our laws been made so strict,
I Would never lost my Joy,
Who was my Love and Heart's Delight,
my handsome Gilderoy.
'Cause Gilderoy had done amiss,
must he be punished then?
What kind of cruelty is this,
to hang such handsome Men?
The Flower of the Scottish Land,
a sweet and lively Boy,
He likewise had a Lady's hand.
my handsome Gilderoy.
At Leith they took my Gilderoy,
and there, God wot, they banged him,
Carried him to fair Edinburgh,
and there, God wot, they hanged him,
They hanged him up above the rest,
he was so trim a Boy,
My only Love and Heart's Delight,
my handsome Gilderoy.
Thus having yielded up his breath,
in cyprus he was laid,
Then for my Dearest, after death,
a funeral I made,
Over his grave a marble stone,
I fixed for my Joy,
Now I am left to weep alone,
for my dear Gilderoy.
