The Complaint of a Lover forsaken of his Love.
To a pleasant new Tune.


A Poor Soul sat sighing, by a Sicamore Tree.
O Willow, willow, willow:
His hand on his bosom, his head on his knee,
O Willow, willow, willow,
O Willow, willow, willow,
Sing O the green Willow shall be my Garland.
He sighed in his singing, and after each groan
O Willow, willow, willow:
Adue to all pleasure, my true love is gone,
O Willow, willow, willow,
O Willow, willow, willow,
Sing O the green Willow shall be my Garland.
Oh false she is turned, untrue she does prove,
O Willow, willow, willow:
She renders me nothing but hate for my love.
O Willow, willow, etc.
Sing O the green Willow, etc.
Oh pity me (cride he) you Lovers each one,
O Willow, etc.
Her heart's hard as Marble, she rues not my moan,
O Willow, willow, willow etc.
Sing O the green Willow, shall be my Garland.
The cold streams ran by him, his eyes wept apace,
O willow, willow, willow:
The salt tears fell from him, which drowned his face,
O Willow, willow, etc.
Sing O the green Willow, etc.
The mute Birds sat by him, made tame by his moan,
O Willow, etc.
The salt tears fell from him, which softened the stone,
O Willow, etc.
Sing O the green Willow,
Let no body blame me, her scorns I do prove,
O Willow, etc.
She was borne to be false, and I dye for her love:
O Willow, willow, etc.
Sing O the green willow shall be my Garland.
O that beauty should harbor, a heart that is so hard,
O Willow, willow, etc.
My true love rejecting, without all regard:
O Willow, etc.
Sing O the green Willow, etc.
Let Love no more boast him, in Palace or Bower.
O Willow, etc.
For Women are trothlesse, and fleet in an hour:
O Willow, etc.
Sing o the green, etc.
But what helps complaining, in vain I complain,
O Willow, etc.
I must patiently suffer, her scorn and disdain:
O Willow, etc.
Sing O the green, etc.
Come all you forsaken, and sit down by me,
O Willow, etc
He' that plaineth of his false love, mine is falser then she:
O VVillovv, etc.
Sing O the green, etc.
The Willow wreath wear I, since my Love did fleet,
O Willow, etc.
A Garland for Lovers forsaken most meet:
O Willow, Willow, etc.
Sing o the green Willow shall be my Garland.
FINIS.
The second Part,
To the same Tune.




LOw laid by my sorrow, begot by disdain,
O Willow, Willow, Willow,
Against her, too cruel, still still I complain:

O VVillovv, etc.
So hang it (friends) ore me, in Grave where I lie:
