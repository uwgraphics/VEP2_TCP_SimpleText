Lusty Friar of Flanders; How in a Nunnery at the City of Gaunt this Friar got
Thirty Nuns with Child in three Weeks; time, and afterward made his escape.
To the Tune of, Cold and Raw.


NOt long ago from hence I went,
to travel into Flanders,
To learn the Art of War, was scut.
under those great Commanders;
At Gaunt I saw a pleasant fun,
as you shall hear hereafter,
Betwixt a Friar and a Nun,
may well deserve your laughter.
The Friar like a Jolly Dad,
a propagating Father,
Did not the Talent which he had,
but chose to use it rather:
The Nun was pretty, young, and fair,
as if designed for pleasure,
And pity 'twas that she should swear,
to keep her Virgin treasure.
Unto this Lusty Friar she went,
and there her sins confessed,
Which he, unto her hearts content,
forgave and her released;
But this he said, before you rise,
for all your sad offenses,
By good St. Francis, i will Chastise
with Rods your Preter Tenses.
Her hinder Quarters up she turns,
and there she lay most fairly,
The Friar now in Lust he burns,
and flaug'd her off most rarely:
Her prayers and tears at last (...)
upon the cruel Friar(...)
That he would no more corre(...)
nor would he us w^den(...)
Then pretty Nymph arise he said,
and let me now embrace thee,
Bestow on me your Maidenhead,
fear not that i will disgrace thee;
What though my Robe be black my dear,
my skins as white as may be,
And I have that has pleased i will swear,
oh many a gallant Lady.
The Charming Nun then blushing said
oh tempt me not to evil,
Have I not vowed to live a Maid,
and to renounce the Devil,
But should I now commit this Crime,
and breast my bow by sporting,
My belly will grow big in time,
and then you will leave your Courting.
The Sin, my Dear, is Denial,
and to indulge is easy,
Sin on and i will forgive you all,
my Love, if you will but please me:
But since you fear to breed young bones,
i will tell you for their Glory,
The Lady Abbess and her Nuns,
have done the like before you.
This Nun oh she grew big at last,
and daily i^ increases,
And e're ten months were fully past,
the Nuns fell all a pi^^es
The crafty Friar away he went,
that he should (...) 'twas pity
And left behind a Regiment
of baliards to the City.
Thus he this Creature did beguile,
but tell me wan't he dirty.
Twenty nine Nuns he would got with Child.
and this made up the thirty;
He had a f^^^ly to Cure,
each longing expectation.
So this religious ^^aseal sure,
is able to stock a nation.
