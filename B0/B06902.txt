The Last WILL and TESTAMENT OF FATHER PETRES.
I.
IN his Holiness Name,
With Amen I proclaim
My Last Will and Testament following:
Who in Body am well,
But in Mind monstrous ill;
While in dismal Despair I am wallowing.
II.
My Soul I bequeath,
To the Regions beneath;
It has long to the Devil been due:
To be tortured in pain,
More than I did ordain
To inflict on the Heretic Crew.
III.
My Body a pledge,
I give to the Sledge,
To ride on it to Tyborn in state:
And there in a Cart,
Before I depart,
All my Villainous Actions relate.
IV.
When the Rout I Have harang'd,
To submit to be Hanged;
And ere Dead to be cut down and Quartered:
While each Blockhead and Whore,
Dips a Clout in my Gore,
To proclaim to the World I am Martyred.
V.
My Politic Head
With my Quarters when Dead,
Each one to be perched on a Pole;
Thus by prophetic Spirit,
According to Merit,
I Have disposed of my Body and Soul.
VI.
And next I declare
Not to mention an Heir,
My Executors wholly and full,
To Cut of all other,
The Spark and his Mother,
Who Three Politic Nations would Gull.
VII.
My Funeral Charge,
As it will not be large,
So 'twill take up less Room in my Will:
But were it much more,
Since I die on this Score,
They Will never be troubled with Bill.
VIII.
It may do 'em both good
For all their High Blood,
It Is full Threescore thousand Complete:
As I got it by Fools,
So I leave it to Tools,
While the Church and Relations I Cheat.
IX.
My Books, though not many,
For I never loved any,
They may keep for their private Occasions;
They Are of Riddles and Dreams,
From whence I took Themes
To furnish my self with Orations.
X.
The rest of my Stuff,
Since they have enough,
I Bequeath to a pretty young Sinner;
Twill furnish a Room
'To practice at Home,
And Encourage a happy Beginner.
XI.
I Will not give 'em the Trouble
To pay the Priests double,
To fetch me from Purgatory:
For that like the rest
Of our Creed, is a Jest;
And as true as the Song of John Dory.
XII.
For if there is a Hell,
I deserve it so well
I need not Despair of the Place;
And none but an Ass
Will believe that the Mass,
Can ever restore him to Grace.
XIII.
I confess there are Fools,
Which our Church daily Gulls,
And particularly with this Notion:
Such as when they do Pray,
Know not one word they say,
It Is their Ignorance helps their Devotion.
XIV.
But I am wide of my Text,
Being damnably vexed
To see how the Jesuits are Fooled;
And your Prospects of Peace
Does my Torments increase,
More than loosing my Life and my Gold.
XV.
On our Brotherhood all
May my last Blessing fall,
And on every Monk, Friar and Priest;
May they ere it is too late
Partake of my Fate,
And become every Heretics Jest.
XVI.
I would have Enlarged,
But my Conscience discharged,
I Will here make an End of my Sermon,
And wish all this Throng
May be damned, Old and Young,
And so drive away Honest Carman.
FINIS.
