TO THE READER.
REader these Lines to bring to Light,
Did put me in a Terrer;
Yet hoping you will be so kind to me,
As tell me of an Error;
When Time and Leisure does permit,
I shall Correct them farther.
Indeed to bring them into Verse,
I did as I am able;
But my design into the thing,
Is to make you look the Bible.
When I do see in most these Verse,
I do begin the Line;
Yet turn the I unto thy self,
And then thou make it thine.
