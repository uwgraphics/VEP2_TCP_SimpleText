REBELLION SCISM SE(...)
(...)
Then Faction comes with his confused breath,
Breaths forth his mind, and whispers in the ear,
To those who is by him accounted dear;
And freely does unfold how he is bent
Against his Prince and Lawful Government:
None strives to reconcile that strange in demur,
They value not what dangers may incur;
Ambitions Pride did more and more increase,
For to divide the Land, disturb the Peace.
In this Caballing strain they did run on,
Contrary to the Laws of God and Man:
The Root and Branch of this Rebellious Tree
Grew great, and spread it self by Villainy.
Here one lies down, who freely did conspire
To spew forth Coals of most contentious Fire:
Then Satan comes, and in these Words he said,
There Is nothing can be done without my aid;
'Twas I that first did put you in the way,
Then follow on your blows, make no delay:
And I will be as helpful to you still
In your proceedings, to my utmost skill.
No sooner Satan had this Promise made,
But wretched Man most willingly obeyed.
Rebellion taken Root, like Evil Weeds
Did grow, from Thought to Words, then heinous Deeds.
Behold where Satan lies! what pains he takes
To blow the Flames, and vast confusion makes.
He at the Root does like a Serpent lurk,
Seeking to set his Ingines all at work;
To make desention both in Church and State,
And all through very hope of being great:
(...)
All in disorder by (...)
Till Ruin had the Nation overspread.
We see in part by what they took in hand,
They Would slay the Subjects to preserve the Land:
But see the just reward of their outrage,
They are become Examples of this Age.
When from Rebellion all their hopes does flow,
The hand of Justice gives the fatal Blow:
The Figure here does fairly represent
The final Fall of Traitors Insolent.
Observe the Root, there Satan he insnares,
Behold the Tree, and see what Fruit she bears!
With lofty Arms she all her Branches spreads,
Her chiefest Fruit she bears, is Traitors Heads.
By Treason they their own destruction wrought,
And at the length was here to Justice brought,
Those that behold their fatal destiny,
Keeping the Paths of Love and Loyalty;
Then Peace and Plenty daily will increase,
And all the Land be filled with Joy and Peace.
Let Loyalty be found through all the Lands,
And every Subject in obedience stand:
To Royal JAMES, our Gracious Sovereign Lord,
Let all the Nation pray with one accord:
That those which shall succeed from Age to Age,
May never see the like of this outrage;
But he preserved from violence secure,
So long as shall the Sun and Moon endure.
This may be Printed,
