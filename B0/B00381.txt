The Revolted Lover. OR A young Maiden is apt to be won, Approved by what
this Damsel has done.
To a pleasant new tune.




ONce I loved a Maiden fair,
but she did deceive me,
She with Venus might compaire,
in my mind, believe me
she was young,
and among
Creatures of temptation:
who will say,
but Maidens may,
Kiss for recreation?
Maidens fair, have a care,
chastity is fading:
Want of grace in a place,
made her use her trading,
I did think her
for to be
Chaster then Diana,
but the Boy
has blinded me,
More then ever any,
Three times I made it known
to the Congregation,
That the Church had her own,
as Priest had made relation.
married we
straight must be,
Although we go a begging:
but now by love
it is like to prove
a very hopeful wedding.
She did swear and protest,
with fluent tears weeping
Above all men she loved me best,
and said I was her sweeting
but alas,
false it was,
Chastity was voiding:
every one
may freely choose
Her beauty that loves trading.
Then let young men be aduisd,
trust not any wanton
Beauty being too high-prizd,
find such ground to plant on,
that no man,
do what he can,
Shall confine their duties,
they will gad
and be mad,
To show forth their beauties.
Happy he who never knew
what to Love belonged:
Maidens wavering and untrue,
many a man have wronged:
so has she,
wronged me,
By her false dissembling:
for to hear
her to swear
Often my heart was trembling,
The Second part.
To the same Tune.


BUt the chiefest cause is this,
was by some persuasions.
Who enticed her to do amiss,
by their strong temptations
she was apt
to be trapt.
being young and stupid:
many strove
for her love,
pricked on by Cupid.
I do scorn and detest,
to have any Rival:
Let her take whom she likes best,
since for her they strive all:
when I wed
I Will be sped,
with one whose mind is fixed,
and my love
nere to move:
I Will not be commixed.
In my love with any man,
I Will have all, or nothing,
If she love another man,
to me her love is loathing:
I will scorn
ere to mourn
for a wanton feather:
if I find
her unkind,
then the Deel gang with her.
You who take so much delight
in getting handsome Lasses,
Alas, they will delude your sight,
I pity much your cases:
their bright eyes
can surprise
men that do behold them;
young men's words
them affords
matter to new mould them.
Farewell thou faithless Girl,
I Will not sorrow for thee:
Once I held thee dear as pearl,
but now I do abhor thee:
had thou staid
still a maid,
and modesty retained,
then my mind
firm combind,
had with thee remained.
But now I am resolved,
nere with thee to marry
Til soul and body be dissolved,
I will rather tarry,
if I find
to my mind
one of virtues children,
then I soon
will have done.
but I Will tarry till then.
FINIS.
