THE NEW BALLAD. OF THE LASS OF PEATIES MILL.
To its own Proper Tune.
INto the month of March,
As I went to the North,
Beyond the Carnemont.
Far beyond Tay and Forth,
I came to Peaty Kirk,
And there I longed all night;
Where that I saw a Lass
Of beauty shining bright,
I thought her my delight,
When I did her behold:
And thought I would not quite
Her to her weight of Gold,
Her beauty for to tell,
Does far (...) mount my skill.
This dainty Nymph was called,
The Lass of Peaties Mill.
This Lass of Peaties Mill.
To speak for none will spare:
Many one came to woo her,
Because she was so fair,
Because she was so fair, Love,
And (...) ^^^oth to her eye,
O if this bonny Lashe,
Would grant to marry me.
From Peatie Kirk I went,
Then down to Peaties Mill,
To give this Lass a visit,
And asked her good will,
(...) answered me discreatly,
Wi^h words loving and kind:
(...) there we kissed sweetly,
^ut fortune crossed my mind.
For if I loved her well,
Her father loved her better:
Her friends and mother loved her so,
That I could never get her,
But I shall write a Letter,
When all these days are done,
Unto the gouk that gets her,
He wears but my old shoon.
For after speaking to her friends,
To her I did resort;
And since her friends refused me,
I thought to play a sport:
And went to seek comfort
Unto this Maid most rare:
Because in heart I thought,
I never saw one so fair.
Sweet heart to her I said,
Will thou grant me good will,
And I shall bless the day,
I came to Peaties Mill,
Alace! for love I die;
For never saw I none,
Like thee for rare beauty.
Good Sir, if ye speak true,
And faithful, did she say,
I shall be very loath
For to cast you away.
Welcome both night and day,
Ye may come me until.
And heartly welcome shall ye be
To grind at Peaties Mill.
To grind's not my desire:
But for to play with you,
My heart is set on fire,
Dear heart, for love of you,
Therefore hear what I say,
And grant me thy good will,
And I shall bless the day
I came to Peaties Mill.
Then sw^etly we did kiss,
And then began to play:
But when her friends did mise
Her Maidenhead away.
They sought me night and day!
Til that I came them till:
And I was welcome too
To grind at Peaties Mill.
We wedded were with speed,
But I t^^(...) did stay:
For she de(...)
Was on her wedding days
But now (...) no more,
As I before have done,
Nor will my sweet compare
Again to my old shoon.
She at this time brought forth
A rare and gallant boy,
Which was his mothers mirth;
Also his fathers joy.
Then hence may annoy,
For all that has been done:
There is no frolic boy.
Dare put on my old shoon.
