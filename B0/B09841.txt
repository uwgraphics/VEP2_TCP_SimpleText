Reading Fight.
To the Tune of Lylliburlero; OR, O Brother Teague, do hear the Decree?
1
Do hear, Brother Teague, how de Cause goes?
In Reading they put Blood on our Nose:
We dear did agree in de Dark to creep,
And Massacre all in deir dead Sleep.
Lero lero, Lero lero, Lylliburlero, Bullen-a-la.
2
But de sly Her'ticks watching all Night,
Put us to stink for fear dey would Fight:
We den did consult to lay new Snares,
And de next Day to kill them at Prayers.
Lero lero, etc.
3
Five Hundred and more true Boys combined,
To Murder them all before dey Dined:
Each kept his Post with Hand on his Sword;
Thus we all stood expecting de Word.
Lero lero, etc.
4
But now by my Shoul, me quake to tell,
Eighty wild Dutchmen, as fierce as Di-vell,
All in a Trice so hedged us around,
Dat at de first Blow dey make us give Ground.
Lero lero, etc.
5
Never were Men with Fury so swelled,
With deir great Tooths deir Bridles dey held.
In one Hand a Sword, in d'other a Gun;
Thus Engaged, we wisely did Run.
Lero lero, etc.
6
Our Captains swore to us, Face about;
But 'twas too late, our Courage was out:
And dey were as quick to Fly as we,
None durst look back on d' Enemy.
Lero lero, etc.
7
Whilst dey rode up, we Gallop't away,
We soon had enough of such Dutch Play:
Dey hunted us round de Streets like Dogs,
O Brother Teague, we wished for our Bogs!
Lero lero, etc.
8
We put d'Cross on our Faces all over;
But for all dat, we ran as before:
We fled for Salvashon in de Church;
But here by Chreest we were left in de Lurch.
Lero lero, etc.
9
For d' Protestant Horses found us out,
And put us all to a Second Rout:
We thought of d'Advice a Priest once gave,
Dat none but de Cath-lick Church can Save.
Lero lero, etc.
10
Many Dear-Joys lay Wounded and Slain;
Some Ran away, and never came again:
And now by St. Patrick, what do think?
Have we not Reason enough to Stink?
Lero lero, etc.
11
Now, are we not finely brought to Bed?
Instead of Lords, we are Knocked on de Head:
Dey promised us Houses, Farms, and Land,
And told us, All was at our Command,
Lero lero, etc.
12
When first we Arrived on d' English Shore;
But now we shall never see Ireland more.
O Padre Peter's, dat Imp of de Pope,
Now he has brought our Bodies to Rope.
Lero lero, etc.
13
Dear is a thing one Leg and a Pair,
Where many Teagues will say deir Last Prayer:
Dear will d' Hangman put Neck in de Noose,
So we Dear-Joys must dye in our Shoes.
Lero lero, etc.
14
Ah! who in England would come to be Rich,
To swing like a Dog, and rot in a Ditch?
Let Us fling down our Arms, and howl our A-bone,
O Irish Lads, we are all undone.
Lero lero, etc.
15
But what if we first with some Her-tick Blood,
Wash out our Sins, and so become good?
Then let us dye Martyrs for Cath-lick Cause,
Since dat our Swords cannot cut Penal Laws.
Lero lero, Lero lero, Lylliburlero, Bullen-a-la.
London, Printed in the Year 1689.
