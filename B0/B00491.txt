An excellent new Medley,
Which you may admire at (without offense)
For every line speaks a contrary senses
To the tune of, Tarletons Medley.




IN Summer time when solkes make Hay,
All is not true which people say,
The foole's the wisest in the play,
tush take away your band:
The Fiddlers boy has broke his Base,
Sirs is not this a pittious case,
Most gallants loath to smell the Mace
of Woodstreet.
The City follows Courtly pride,
Ione swears she cannot John abide,
Dicke wears a Dagger by his side.
come tell us what is to pay.
The Lawyers thrive by others fall,
The weakest always goes to the wall,
The Shoemaker commands all
at's pleasure.
The Weauer prays for Huswiues store,
A pretty woman was Jane Shore.
Kick the base Rascals out o'th door:
peace, peace, you bawling Curres.
A Cuckolds band wears out behind,
It Is easy to beguile the blind,
All people are not of one mind,
hold Carmen.
Our women cut their hair like men,
The Cocke's ore-mastred by the Hen
There Is hardly one goodfriend in ten,
turn there on your right hand:
But few regard the cries o'th poor,
Will spends all upon a whore,
The Soldier longs to go ore,
brave knocking.
When the fifth Henry saild to France,
Let me alone for a Country dance,
Nell does bewail her lucklesse chance,
f^e on false hearted men:
Dicke Tarleton was a merry wagge,
Hark how that prating ass does brag,
John Dory sold his ambling Nagge,
for Kicke-shawes.
The Saylor counts the Ship his house,
I Will say no more but dun's the Mouse,
He is no man that scorns a Louse,
vain pride undoes the Land:
Hard hearted men make Corn so dear,
Few Frenchmen love well English beer,
I hope ere long good news to hear,
hey Lusticke.
Now hides are cheap, the Tanner thriues,
Hang those basemen that beat their wives.
He needs must go that the Devil drives,
God bless us from a Gun:
The Beadles make the lame to run,
Vaunt not before the battaile's won,
A Cloud sometimes may hide the Sun,
chance medley.
The Second Part.
To the same tune.


THy friend such lewdness soon will check,
And tell thee thou art like to lack,
He Will bid thee always have a care
Of that which thou do little fear,
And that is, poverty will grow,
Which thy true friend would not have so.
The false and fained Flatterer
Will seek to trap thee in his snare,
His words most sweet shall still appear
To get thy money, wine and beer:
These are certain signs to know
A faithful friend from a flattering foe.
If that thy friend be true indeed,
He Will not forsake thee in thy need,
He Will take thy part in weal and woe,
Thy flattering friend will not do so:
These are certain signs to know
A faithful, etc.
Now some perchance may this object,
And say they are of the true Sect,
But such I Will never trust till I
Their inward thoughts do prove and try,
Then I certain am to know
A faithful, etc.
If that you want, then needs of force,
For your relief you will take some course,
Need stands behind and bids you go,
The kindness of men's hearts to know,
And where once you have tried it so,
You Will know your friend, etc.
Thy friend will wondrous sorry be
To see thee fall to misery,
And to his power he will give relief
To ease thy dolor, woe and grief:
These are certain signs to know
A faithful, etc.
Your fair tongued fawning hypocrite
Will say that you were void of wit,
To spend your means so foolishly,
And lack so long before you dye.
These are certain signs to know
A faithful, etc.
Then this advice take then of me,
Before need comes go thou and see,
Try whilst thou have of thiue own,
And see where favor may be shown:
Then thou soon shall find and know
A faithful, etc.
And look where thou did favor find,
There be not wavering like the wind,
If that thy friend prove just and true,
Then do not change him for a new:
Thus to all men I do show
The difference twix a friend and foe.
For my part I may plainly say,
That friends are apt for to decay,
In wealth a man shall have great store,
But very few if once grown poor:
This I write for men to know
A faithful, etc.
When I had means then I had friends,
But now I want, their friendship ends,
Now but few will take my part,
Nor help release me of my smart:
This I have writ for men to know
A faithful, etc.
Thus to conclude and end my Song,
Let me advise both old and young,
If thou do wish for many friends,
Then have a care and get some means:
Then you need not care to know
A faithful friend from a flattering foe.
