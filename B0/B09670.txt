April 18. 1676.
Whereas on Friday last, April 14th at Midnight, several Outrages were
committed, by breaking the Windows, as well of Colleges, as private houses, in
many places of this City; to the great disturbance of the Inhabitants, the
scandal of Government, and breach of the Public Peace: This is therefore
earnestly to request all persons, who wish well to the good Order and Peace of
this University and City, that they would use the best means they can to bring
to light the Authors of these misdemeanors. And whosoever shall discover to Me
any one, or more, that were Actors or Accessories in the same, I do hereby
oblige my self to conceal his name, and give him forty shillings for his
Intelligence.

RA. BATHVRST Vicechancellor.
