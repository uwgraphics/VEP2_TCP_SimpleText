The kind hearted Maidens Resolution, Wherein she does show her real affection
and true Love unto her dearest friend.
Her Father and Mother they still do say no,
Yet she is resolved with her Love for to go.
To the Tune of, Jenny Ienny.


Now farewell dear Father
and Mother also,
(...) blessing
^

(...) Shore,
For I will (...) with my Love
all the world over.
But I hope my dear Daughter
you will not be such a one,
A^ to go and forsake us
and leave us alone,
Now we have brought you up
and by you sit great store
Now you will go with your Love etc.
But let reason rule you
at home for to stay,
And go not such a journey
lea^t you loose your way
Thou'st have all when we dye
what would thou have more,
If thou't not go with thy Love, etc.
I vallue not your ^iches
nor your brave (...),
^o I have but the ^^n
whom my heart (...),
There Is no Locks nor Bolts
shall keep me in a door,
But I, etc.
FOr his sight and his presence
is dearer to me,
Then all the rich Treasures
in the world I can see,
In my arms i will embrace him
his joys to restore,
And I will go with my Love
all the world over.
For what joy or what comfort
has any young Girl,
Though she wears rich jewels
of Gold or yet Pearl,
If her Sweetheart be wanting
her heart will be sore,
So I, etc.
Does not Ladies of Honor
a man much regard,
And shall I for his kindness
with disdain him reward,
No first i will be hanged
upon the next door,
For I, etc.
Oh did not fair Phillis
that Lady so bright,
Unknown at her Gate
fed her Husband and Knight,
And at his death she
grieved full sore,
So I, etc.
Then why may not I
be as true to my friend,
As ever was Phillis
unto my Lives end,
There Is no enchanting tongue
shall win me on no score,
But I, etc.
He may be in danger
or sick he may lie,
And for want of my company
there he may dye,
But i will be his Surgeon
for to cure his sore,
And I, etc.
All that I can do for him
the truth for to tell,
Nothing shall be wanting
my Love to maintain,
I Will run through fire and Water
or though the deep sore,
But I, etc.
His behavior and favor
and so civil in's ways,
That whoever sees him
they give him the praise,
Which makes me so much
his fame to implore,
And for to go with, etc.
He Is no Ranter nor Swearer
nor Drunkard at all.
Yet he will laugh and be merry
yet modest withal,
He Is courteous and humble
to the Rich and to Poor,
Which makes me go with, etc.
And thus have I told to
young Maids in some part,
The conditions of him
whom I love as my heart
But pray don't long for him
nor yet cry nor ^^^re,
For I will go with my Love
all the world over.
