Englands pleasant May-Flovver OR,
Charles the second, as we say,
Came home the twenty ninth of May.
Let Loyal hearts rejoice and sing
For joy they have got a Gracious KING.
The tune is, Upon Saint David's day.


WHy should we speak of Cesars Acts,
or Shimei's treacheries,
Or of the Grand Notorious Facts
of Cromwels Tyrannies.
But what we all might gladly sing,
and bravely chant and say,
That Charles the second did come in
the twenty ninth of May.
Since that his Royal person went
from us beyond the Seas,
Much blood and treasure have been spent
but nere obtained peace:
Until the Lord withheld his hand
as we might cheerful say,
And did a healing balsome send
the twenty, etc.
This healing Balsome Sovereign is,
and a very Cordial thing,
Which many evils can suppress
by virtue of a King,
And poisoned blisters overcome
which in three Kingdoms lay,
It Was God that sent this Balsome home
the twenty, etc.
Surely he is determined.
a mighty King on Earth,
That God has so remembered,
and kept him from his birth:
As David from the Lions paws
whose beard he bore away.
So Charles the second made good Laws
the twenty ninth of May.
The King of Africa subdued
by fire and by sword,
But Charles the second was indu'd
with power from the Lord.
Who trained was in David's field
with prayers night and day.
That he three stately Kingdom held
the twenty, etc.
King David had a General strong,
and Joab was called by name,
He made him Lord of Babylon,
and ruled where ere he came.
But through his spleen with envied quarrels
David did betray.
But our Saint George brought home King Charles
the twenty ninth of May
The second part, To the same tune.


NOw give me leave to speak so far
as truth might justify,
Of that most glorious blazing Star
at his Nativity,
The grandest Planet of the morn
shined glorious at noon day:
Which was the time King Charles was born
the twenty ninth of May.
I think I could my self engage,
in deep Astrology,
To speak what this same Star presaged
of Grorious Majesty
A mighty Monarch he shall Reign
which makes me ch^nt and say
Now brave King Charles is come again.
the twenty, etc.
'Twould blunt the pen of any Poet,
to write what may be said,
But to the Order Honi Soyt
just tribute shall be paid
For such a prudent Gracious King
lets never cease to pray,
He heald the sick when he came in
the twenty etc.
Gods holy hand does him protect
his Angels does him guard,
Likewise his students does direct,
which makes his foes afraid.
On David's music we will sing
and bravely chant and say,
The glory of the world came in
the twenty ninth of May.
He always wears Joshua's hands
and bears David's praise.
And like to upright Job he stands
to wear out Abraham's days.
He was the wit of Solomon,
and upright in his way.
So like to Joseph he came home
the twenty ninth of May.
Like Daniel he was so devout,
his Star did follow him,
In all his tragedyes throughout
like that of Bethleem.
Twelve years he traveled Christendom
that makes me chant and say,
'Twas marked out just for his own,
the twenty etc.
Now let all people celebrate
this day which is so pure,
And to be kept by Church and State
for ever to endure.
That Generations all might see
the honor of the day,
Which everlasting it shall be
the twenty, etc.
So God preserve our Gracious King
the Duke of York also,
Defend them from the Dragons sting
and every Christian Foe.
Then let true Loyal Subjects sing
and bravely chant and say,
The like in England nere came in
the twenty ninth of May.
