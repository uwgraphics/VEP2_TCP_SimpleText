THE Bonny Scottish Lad, AND THE Yielding Lass.
To an excellent new Tune much in Request, called The Liggan Waters.




BOnny Lass I love thee well,
bonny Lad I love thee better,
Will thou pull off thy Hose and Shoon,
and wend with me to Liggan Water?
Liggan Water is so deep,
and I am loath to wet my feet.
But if you will promise to marry me.
I Will put off my Shoon and follow thee.
I have House, and I have Land,
I have all things at command,
I have a thing that you never see,
Bonny Lass will thou Mow with me?
I good store of Cattle keep,
Cows, Bulls and Oxen, Hogs and Sheep,
And all I have I Will give to thee,
bonny Lass will thou mow with me?
Bonny Lad it is all in vain,
before you shall your will obtain,
I Will make you promise to marry me,
and then thou'st freely Mow with me.
For your Goods and Lands I do not care,
then bonny Jocky pray forbear,
For I will never yield to thee,
without you will promise to Marry me.


As I went forth one Morning fair,
I met with a bonny Lass, fresh and gay,
A bonnier Lass, I never did see
until I chanced to meet with thee.
This bonny Lass did ogle me,
and I could hardly pass her by,
She began for to be so free,
and sighing said, she would dye for me.
From her white hand a Ring she took,
and said, My Lad this is for thee,
She gave me a smiling look,
and soon did yield to lig with me.
Then bonny Jenny pity take,
Ise left that bonny Lass for your sake:
Soon I began to fancy thee,
then bonny Jenny lie with me.
All night in softest Wool we'll lie,
and kiss as close as Cockles do;
Then we the Bliss of Love will try,
in Summer and in Winter too.
How can you so fickle be
to dote on all that you do see?
If I should yield to lig with thee,
thou soon would prove as false to me
I Would have all Lasses wiser grow,
and not fond Love to young Men show
For before that I do yield to thee,
I Will make you promise to marry me.
But yet alas! for all her Act
little Cupid shot a Dart,
That she could not resist Love's Charm
but strait did yield to Jocky's Arms.
Printed for I. Conyers at the Black Raven in H^^born.
