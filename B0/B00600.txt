The Good-fellowes Advice:
Showing what favor a man shall have while he has means,
But being in want, then all Friendship ends.

To the tune of, Upon a Summer time.


FArewell good company,
now I must leave you all:
It has bred my misery,
and brought me into thrall.
But now I will refrain
and drink strong Ale no more,
I Will seek to purchase gain,
and quite forsake a Whore.
Good-fellowes great and small,
pray let met you advise,
To have a care withal,
it is good to be merry and wise.
Now I have spent my means,
and have no money to pay,
I Am quite bereft of friends,
which breeds my sad annoy:
But while I had silver and gold
to pay for them and me,
Then many have me told
I was brave company.
Good-fellowes, etc.
But now they me despise,
and ask what make you here:
Therefore I Will now grow wise,
and will live void of fear:
I can get money enough
when I do seek for it,
Were not for drink and snuff,
that robs of my wit.
Good-fellowes etc.
Strong drink I will refuse,
for it has done me wrong,
It has made me abuse
my self with hand and tongue,
When I have been in drink
I had no care at all,
Nor did I ever think
upon my own downfall.
Good-fellowes, etc.
I still cried fill the Pot,
whilst all my money was gone,
And did pay many a shot
for others as it is well known:
And they gave me fair words,
whilst I could still do so:
But now their tongs are swords,
from whence envy does flow.
Good-fellowes, etc.
My good will is repaid
with envy, hate, and spite,
Some of them snares have laid
to take me with deceit,
They laugh at my downfall,
as plainly I do prove,
Scarce any of them all
repay me any love.
Good-fellowes, etc.
Had I known this before.
while I had money and means,
I had kept some in store,
but I was shallow brains.
For which some call me Ass,
to spend my means away:
Now I may feed on grass,
as freely fast and pray.
Good-fellowes, etc.
The time has been that I
could not have past by the doors,
But as I walked by
such company as rores.
Would cause me to sit down,
and welcome should be made:
But many times a crown,
for such welcomes I paid.
Good-fellowes great and small.
pray let me you advise,
To have a care withal,
it is good to be merry and wise.
The second part
To the same tune.






TObacco, Ale, and Beer,
for me was brought amain,
With Wine and dainty cheer,
served in with Venus train.
Look what I wished to have,
they did fulfill my mind,
Most dainty words they gave,
which made me think them kind.
Good-fellowes great and small,
pray let me you advise,
To have a care withal,
it is good to be merry and wise.
But now the proverbs true,
'twas money was my friend,
For having none I rue,
there is none will give nor lend.
They say the world is hard,
and that I find indeed,
For none do me regard,
now I am in most need.
Good-fellowes, etc.
If I to the Alehouse go,
and call for Ale or Beer,
My Hostess soon will know
my stock for she is in fear.
If I call but two pots,
and pay not presently,
Then quickly for her shots,
she will begin to cry.
Good-fellowes, etc.
But I do know her mind,
it is money she would see,
And then she will prove kind,
or else a Devil is she.
For those that have no money
shall be thrust out of doors,
For such poor men as I
she will not trust on the scores.
Good-fellowes, etc.
When I had money good store,
and had no need at all,
Then I might freely score,
whatever I did call.
But now I am in want
of Money, Bread, and Beer,
At me sh^e'l loudly taunt,
and ask, What make you here?
Good-fellowes, etc.
Now I repent too late,
I cannot call again
My money and estate,
that I have spent in vain:
I must take an new course,
and seek to get some more,
But yet sometimes of force,
my miseries I deplore.
Good-fellowes great, etc.
Some wonder now at me,
and say I am grown strange,
But they shall plainly see
that I my life will change.
For I Will not spend a penny
amongst the drunken crew,
O I have spent too many,
that makes me have so few.
Good-fellowes, etc.
Had I done so in time,
I never had known such want,
But I with each would join.
there is nothing could me daunt.
I never took no care
what e're my friends did say:
But what is fallen to my share,
even grief and sad annoy.
Good-fellowes, etc.
But now I will amend
my lewd lascivious life,
For now I do intend
to be ruled by my Wife.
O she is a loving soul,
as ever poor man had,
For her the Bell did toule,
and I vile knave was glad.
Good-fellowes, etc.
But now she is well again,
and will not die this fit,
She shall have to maintain
her, all that I can get.
To conclude, I Will take pains,
next Monday I Will begin,
This Song it appertains
to Women, and to Men.
Good-fellowes great and small,
pray let me you advise,
To have a care withal,
it is good to be merry and wise.
