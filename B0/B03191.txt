AN Excellent New Song lately composed ENTITLED, The New way of Pittcathly
Well. Or, The Gentleman's Love to his Mistress.
To the Tune of, Pollwarth on the Green.
(1)
ONE Morning as I walked
In the gay Time of the Year
When Sporting Nymphs do Frisk a^^^^
To drink the Water clear,
Among'st the rest I spyed a Nymph,
Whose Beauty did excel,
The Crowd of Nymphs that now (...),
The famed Pittcathly Well.
(2)
With Dying Looks I veiw'd her,
And could not shun, but say,
Pray make me your Phisician,
She blushing said me Nay.
I ask't at her, to take a Walk,
She feared we would be seen,
Well take a walk in Woods or Grov^^
In our Pitatchly Green.
(3)
Our striving much at last,
Kind Nature took my Part,
We Walked by Neptun's pleasant Streams
Till Jeanny won my Heart.
Were I Sole Monarch of the Glob,
I Would give it all to thee:
For all the Maids about the Well,
My Jeanny bears the Gree.
(4)
When I come home at Noon,
Refresht with Country Air,
Each courts his Mistaess up and down
And I my Jannie fair.
We danced right kind upon the Green,
And All sing merrily:
Pittcathly Well invite you All,
Come here good Company.
(5)
When I go Home at Night,
With Love and care oppressed,
My Jeanies Image still presents,
And Robes me of my Rest,
I Dream of her my Souls Delight,
Whose Air and graceful mean.
Makes her envied by all the Nymphs
In our Pittcatthly Green.
(9)
O were I but so blessed!
as freely call the min^,
I'do treat thee in my Fathers House,
With Country Cheer that is fine
And if there be no Downy Beds,
I Will chose a place unseen,
Where Young Swans do often Shape,
There Nymphs a gown of Green.
FINIS.
