TO THE QUEEN, On her BIRTHDAY.
Farewell the Year that threatened so
The fairest Light the World can show;
Welcome the New, who is every day,
Restoring what was snatched away
By pining sickness from the Fair,
That matchless Beauty does repair
So fast as the approaching Spring,
Which does to flowery Meadows bring
What the rude Winter from them tore,
Shall give her all she had before:
But we recover not so fast
The sense of such a danger past.
We that esteemed you sent from Heaven
A Pattern to this Island given,
To show us what the Blessed do there,
And what Alive they practiced here.
When that which we Immortal thought
We saw so near destruction brought,
Felt all which you did there endure,
And trembled yet as not secure.
So though the Sun Victorious be,
And from a dark Eclipse set free,
Th'Influence which we fondly fear
Afflicts our thoughts the following year.
But that which may relieve our care
Is, that you have a Help so near
For all the Evils, you can prove
The kindness of your Royal Love.
He that was never known to mourn
So many Kingdoms from him torn,
His tears reserved for you more dear,
More prized then all those Kingdoms were.
For when no Healing Art prevailed,
When Cordials and Elixars failed,
On your pale Cheeks he dropped the shower,
Revived you like a dying Flower.
IMPRIMATUR,

ROGER L'ESTRANGE.
Dec. 5. 1663.
