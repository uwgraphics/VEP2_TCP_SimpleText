The Lunatic Lover: OR, The Young Man's Call to Grim King of the Ghosts for
Cure.
To an Excellent New Tune.
Licensed according to Order.







GRim King of the Ghosts make have,
and bring hither all your Train;
See how the pale Moon does wast!
and just now is in the Wain:
Come you Night-Hags with all your Charms,
and Revelling Witches away,
And hug me close in your Arms,
to you my Respects I Will pay.
I Will Court you and think you fair,
since Love does distract my Brain;
I Will go and I Will wed the Nightmare,
and kiss her and kiss her again.
But if she proves peevish and proud,
then a pise of her Love let her go,
I Will seek me a winding Shroud,
and down to the Shades below.
A Lunacy I endure,
since Reason departs away,
I call to those Hags for cure,
as knowing not what I say:
The Beauty whom I do adore,
now flights me with scorn and disdain;
I never shall see her more,
oh! how shall I bear my pain?
I ramble and range about
to find out my charming Saint,
While she at my Grief does flout,
and smiles at my loud Complaint:
Distraction I see is my Doom,
of this I am too too sure;
A Rival is got in my room,
while Torments I do endure.
Strange Fancies does fist my Head,
while wandering in Despair,
I am to the Deserts lead,
expecting to find her there:
Methinks in a spangl'd Cloud
I see her enthroned on high,
Then to her I cried aloud,
and labored to reach the Sky.
When thus I have raved a while,
and wearied my self in vain,
I lie on the barren Soil,
and bitterly do complain;
Till Slumber has quieted me,
in sorrow I sigh and weep,
The Clouds is my Canopy,
to cover me while I sleep.
I dream that my Charming Fair,
is then in my Rival's Bed,
Whose Tresses of golden Hair,
is no the fair Pillows spread,
Then this does my Passion inflame,
I start and no longer can lie:
An! Silvia, art thou not to blame
in Ruin a Lover? I cry.
Grim King of the Ghosts be true,
and hurry me hence away;
My languishing Life to you,
as Tribute I freely pay:
To the Elysium Shades I post,
in hopes to be free from Care,
Where many a bleeding Ghost
is hovering in the Air.
