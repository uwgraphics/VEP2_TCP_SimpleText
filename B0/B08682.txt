To all ARCHBISHOPS, and BISHOPS, who are not a Shame (to) or ashamed (of) the
NAME of CHRIST before MEN, Grace, Wisdom and Truth, from God our Father, and
from our Lord Jesus Christ, AMEN.
My Lords,
I Thought to have Written in LATIN, that the Subject (being CATHOLIC,) it
might not be confined within our Cinque Ports; and because the LITTLE-HORN
(having sprung up in Latin) it might be so rooted out as it sprang up. But, as
I would not have my Integrity savor of the Vanity of Languages (1 Cor. 14.1.
-- 10.) so I would not run the Gauntlet of my Country-mens Tongues (in the
Apostles Language) to censure me of Barbarism (1 Cor. 14.11.) nor yet to hazard
the Censure of our Savior, as if I shunned the LIGHT of common People ( John
3.19, 20.) I therefore dip my Pen in the IDIOM of our Mother Tongue; And (in
the first place) I most humbly Salute those of mine own Country; that (as it
becomes us first) to cast the Beam out of our own eye (Mat. 7.3, 4, 5. Luke
6.41, 42.) to avoid HYPOCRISY, according to the Counsel of our Savior; So
this Honor of -- Physician heal thy self (Luke 4.23, 24.) may first be
ascribed to your Wisdom. To which Purpose, not knowing how to Address my Papers
to your several PALACES, I have been at the Charge of Printing, and
Distributing them to Booksellers, that they may be conveyed into your hands; to
wash them in Innocence from the little Horn-Change of Times and Laws.

Many HEADS have passed their Sentence on the VISIONS of DANIEL, of whom (the
learned Doctor Moor) has given an impartial Account, and laid the CHANGE of
Times and Laws, at the Doors of ROME. But the particulars of -- WHAT Times and
Laws are changed? And -- WHAT Times and Laws are come in their place? And --
WHEN? And -- by WHOM? is left as a Province for your Glory to bring to LIGHT;
which may (again) set ROME on Fire, either of Zeal, to amend what is amiss; Or
burn to Ashes of perpetual Silence and Oblivion, all their Lies and Changes.

I shall patiently wait one Month, to observe the Operation of this my
Service; which (if it prove ineffectual) I shall not forget that I am a Member
of the Church of Christ, (1 Cor. 12.26.) and of the Body Politic. Much less
shall I deny my self to be First, and Eldest PHYSICIAN to his Majesty's Person
in Ordinary, and my DOCTORSHIP above 62 years standing: Having been Physician
in three Kings and Queens Courts of ENGLAND, besides many others. I must not
(therefore) Palliate the CURE, but search it to the Bottom; and accordingly
having discovered the CAUSE, prescribe the taking it away, that I may not be
unworthy of Subscribing my self,

London, May 29. 1682 My Lords, Your Graces and your Lordships most
Christian-Servant PETER CHAMBERLEN.
