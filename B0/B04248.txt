THE LOYAL HEALTH.
A Court Song,
to a Delicate new Tune, called, At the Foot of a Willow, close under the Shade.
I.
SInce Plotting's a Trade,
Like the rest of the Nation.
Let 'em Lie, and Swear on,
To keep up the Vocation;
Let Tinkers, and Weavers,
And Joyners agree,
To find work for the Cooper,
They Will have none of me;
Let Politic Shams,
In the Statesman abound,
While we quaff our Bumpers,
And set the Glass round:
The jolly true Toper's
The best Subject still,
Who drinks off his Liquor,
And thinks no more ill.
2.
Then let us stand to it,
And like honest Men fall,
Who love King and Country,
Duke, Duchess and all;
Not such as would blow up
The Nation by stealth,
And out of the flame
Raise a new Commonwealth.
Nor such, who against Church
And Bishops do rage,
To advance old Jack Presbyter,
On the new Stage.
But to all honest Tories,
Who Will fight for their King,
And to Crown the brave Work,
With the Court we will begin.
3.
Here Is a Health to the King,
And his Lawful Successors,
To honest Tantivies,
And Loyal Addressors;
But a pox take all those,
That promoted Petitions
To Poison the Nation,
And stir up Seditions;
Here Is a Health to the Queen,
And her Ladies of Honor,
And a pox take all those,
That put Sham-Plots upon her.
Here Is a Health to the Duke,
And the Senate of Scotland,
To all honest Men,
That from Bishops never got-Land.
4.
Here Is a Health to L'estrange,
And the boon Heraclitus:
With true Tory Thompson
Who never did slight us;
But confounding Broom, Paulin,
And Alderman Wrightus,
With Tony and Bethel,
Ignoramus, and Titus
Here Is a Health to the Church,
And all those that are for it,
Gonfusion to Zealots,
And Whigs that abhor it;
May it ever be safe,
From the new mode Refiners:
And Justice be done
Upon Coopers and Joyners.
5.
Here Is a Health to old Hall --,
Who our joys did restore;
And pox take each Popular
Son of a Whore;
To the Spaniard and Daxe,
The brave Russian and Moor,
Who come from far Nations,
Our King to adore;
To all that do Worship,
The God of the Vine,
And to old Jolly Bowman
Who draws us good Wine;
And as for all Traitors,
Whether Baptist or Whig,
May they all trot to Tyburn,
To dance the old Jig.
6.
Here Is a Health to all those,
Love the King and his Laws,
And may they near Pledge it
That Broach the Old Cause.
Here Is a Health to the State,
And a Plague on the Pack
Of Commonwealth Canters
And Presbyter Jack;
To the uppermost pendent
That ever did play
On the highest Top-gallant
Oth' Sovereign oth' Sea;
And he that denies,
To the Standard to lore,
May he sink in the Ocean,
And never Drink more.
