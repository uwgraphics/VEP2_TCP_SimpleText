A MONUMENT OF GODS most gracious preservation of Englandfrom Spanish Invasion,
Aug. 2. 1588. and Popish Treason, Novem. 5, 1605.
To my Posterity.
GODS ancient Church two solemn feasts did keep,
On two set days, by his own Word directed,
Exodus 12.2, 3.
When Pharao's Host was drowned in the deep,
Esth. 9.17.
And when proud Haman's treasons were detected.
Two works of equal grace, but greater wonder,
The Lord has done for us, past all man's reason;
When Papists did attempt to bring us under
Aug. 2. 1588.

great things will remember,
And in remembrance sanctify two days,
In August one, the other in November;
Psalm. 118.24.
Both made by GOD for us to give him praise.
Psalm. 78.4, 6, 7.
Dear children, charge your children after you
Still to observe these Feasts as I do now.
Matthew Haviland.
