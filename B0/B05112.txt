THE REDEEMED CAPTIVE.
The Free Unchain'd Lover boasts
That he is now at Large.
That other men should keep so too
He gives this friendly charge.
Tune, When Aurelia first was




SVrely now I Am out of danger
I Will defy blind Cupids Dart
Love to me is grown a stranger
Therefore i will not break my heart.
Yet all the graces of their faces
They may keep, since I am free
Some are witty, some are pretty
For I Will keep my Liberty.
Once I loved my Mistress dearly
Counting her my chiefest friend
Then I waited late and early
My true Love to recommend.
I quenched the fire of desire
That did burn so cruelly
Then farwell Beauty, it is my duty
For to prize my Liberty.
Once to me she was so cruel
She laughed to see me swim in blood
And when I burned I burned like fuel
Grief came on me like a flood,
Sighs and groanings, sobs and mournings
Were my chief companions still
When I lay panting, for love wanting
Then she had me at her will
The grief and sorrow I went through
Made my life a burden seem
I thought it was time, while in my prime
My Liberty for to redeem.
I Am now compliance, with defiance
And scorn a captive still to be
No charming eyes shall me surprise
Since I have gaind my Liberty.
I pity Lovers who discovers
To their Idols all their pain
Who soon can cure, what they endure
And yet they stubborn will remain.
Count it not duty, when a beauty
You do see, it to adore
If once they find it, do but mind it
You Are enslaved for evermore.
Do but mind me, and you will find me
For to be your chiefest friend
When yo'r taken, and forsaken
Griefs and sorrows will attend.
Often their smilings prove beguilings
And poor men are strangely caught
They prove like Treason to your reason
And lay Embargoes on each thought.
Never heed them, for your freedom
Is of greater value, then
Why should women, captive freemen
Or make slaves of loving men.
Dote no meor then, nor adore them
Whose great beauti's make them proud
Do but fly them, or defy them
Favors on you they will crowd.
