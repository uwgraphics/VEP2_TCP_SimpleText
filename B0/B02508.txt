An Excellent Sonnet of the Unfortunate LOVES, of Hero and Leander.
Tune of, Gerards mistress.




Hero HOw fares
My fair Leander, O vouchsafe to speak,
lest my heart break,
I banished am from thy sweet company,
It Is not
Thy Fathers anger can abase my love,
I still will prove
Thy faithful friend until such time I Dye,
Though Fate
And Fortune does conspire,
to interrupt our love
In spite of fate and fortunes hate,
I still will constant prove,
And though
Our angry friends in malice,
now our bodies parts
Nor friends nor foes, nor scars nor blows,
shall separate our hearts.

Leander. What voice
Is this that calls Leander from her Bower,
from yonder Tower,
The echo of this voice does sure proceed,

Hero. Leander.
It Is thy Hero fain would come to thee,
if it might be,
Thy absence makes my tender heart to bleed,
but oh
This pleasant river Hellisponce,
which is the peoples wonder
Those waves so high does injury,
by parting us asunder.
And though
There Is Ferry men good store
yet none will stand my friend,
To waft me o^re to that fair shore,
where all my grief shall end.

Leander. Hero,
Though I am thy constant Lover still
and ever will,
My angry Father is thy Enemy,
He still
Does strive to keep's asunder now and then,
poor Ferry men
They dare not waft thee over lest they dye,
Nor yet
Dare they convey me
unto my dear ^ero now
My Fathers rage will not asuage,
nor will the same allow,
Be patient
Then dear Hero now
as I am true to thee,
Even so I trust thou art as just,
and faithful unto me.

Hero. Is there
No way to stay an angry Fathers wrath,
whose fury has
Bereaved his child of comfort and content,

Leander. O no,
Dear Hero there is no way that I do know,
to ease my Woe,
My days of joy and comfort now is spent,
You may,
As well go fame
a Lion in the Wilderness,
As to persuade my Fathers aid,
to help me in distress,
His anger
And his River has
kept us asunder long,
He has his will, his humor still,
and we have all the wrong.





Hero. It Is not
Thy Fathers anger, nor this River deep,
the which shall keep,
Me from the imbracements of my dearest friend
For through
This silver stream, my way I mean to take,
even for thy sake,
For thy dear sake my dearest life I Will spend,
Though waves
And winds should both conspire,
mine enemies to be,
My lov's so strong, I fear no wrong
can happen unto me:
O meet
Me in thy Garden,
where this pleasant River glides,
Lend me thy hand, draw me to Land,
what ever me betides.
Now must
I make my tender slender arms my Oars,
help watery powere,
Yea little Fishes teach me how to swim,
And all
Ye sea-nimphs guard me unto yonder banks,
I Will give you thanks
Bear up my body, strengthen every limb,
come
Leander now prepare
thy lovely arms for me,
I come dear love, assist me love,
I may so happy be,

But oh!
A mighty tempest rose,
and he was drowned that Tide,
In her fair sight, his hearts delight,
and so with grief she died.
But when
Her aged Father these things understands,
he wrings his hands,
And tears his hoary hair from off his head,
Society
He shuns and does forsake his meat,
his grief's so great,
And often does make the lowly ground his bed,
O my
Leander would that I
had died to save thy life,
Or that I had when I was sad,
made thee brave Hero's wife,
It was
My trespass, and I do
confess I wronged thee;
Posterity shall know hereby,
the fault lay all in me.
But since
The waves have cast his body on the Land,
upon the sand,
Pis Corpse shall buried be in solemn wise,
One grave
Shall serve them both, and one most stately tomb,
she will make him rome,
Although her corpse be breathless where she lies

Ye Fathers
Have a special care now,
whatsoever you do,
For those that parts true loyal hearts,
themselves were never true.
Though Fate
And fortune cresse poor Lovers,
sometimes as we know,
Pray understand, have you no hand
even in their overthrow.
H. Crouch.
