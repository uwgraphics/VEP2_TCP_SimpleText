The Downfall of William Grismond, Or, A Lamentable Murder by him committed at
Lainterdine in the County of Hereford the 22 of March. 1650. with his woeful
Lamentation.
The tune is, Where is my Love.


O Come you wilful youngmen,
and hear what I shall tell,
My name is William Grismond,
at Lainterdine did dwell,
O there I did a murder,
as it is ^non full well.
And for mine offense I must dye.
There was a Neighbors dauhhter,
that l^ved there hard by,
Whom I had promised Marriage,
and with her I did ly.
I did dissemble with her,
my lust to satisfy.
And for, etc.
I had my pleasure with her,
I had my lewd desire,
The using of her body,
was that I did require.
I was ore come and snared,
by him that is a Liar.
And for, etc.
She claimed of me Marriage,
and said she was with child,
Saying marry me sweet William,
now you have me defil'd'
If you do now forsake me,
O utterly I Am spoiled
And for, etc.
When she had used these speeches,
my anger did arise.
And then to work her overthrow
I quickly did devise.
What though her words was honest
yet I did them despise,
And for, etc.
O mark how it did happen,
this huswife being poor.
And I who was my Fathers heir,
her words did urg me sore.
For I could have another,
with gold and silver store.
And for, etc.
My Father and my mother,
I knew would not consent,
If I had married with her,
I knew I should be shent.
Then unto wicked murder,
my heart was fully bent.
And for, etc.
In flattering sort I brought her,
into a field of broom,
And when we both together,
into the field was come.
I had my pleasure with her,
and then I was her doom.
And for, etc.
Then in the broom I killed her,
with my accursed knife,
There hatefully I killed her,
who loved me as her life.
I cut her throt I killed her.
who should have been my wife.
And for, etc.
Three days she lay there murdered
before that she was found,
But when the neighbors serching
within that broomy ground.
Did find her there uncovered.
and with a bloody wound.
And for mine offense I must dye.




THe Neighbors having found her
where I did do this deed,
There in the broom they found her
where I her blood did shed:
But when I did perceive that
I ran away with speed,
And for mine offense I must dye.
No sooner had they found her,
but I away did go.
I thought to go to Ireland,
the very truth is so.
But God he would not suffer me.
to run my Country throw,
And for, etc.
Yet I was got on Shipboard,
as you may understand,
But when the ship was troubled,
I must go back to Land,
I could not pass away so,
with guilty heart and hand,
And for, etc.
There is some wicked person
the ship-men then did say,
Within this ship we know it,
that cannot pass away.
We must return to land her,
and make no more delay,
And for, etc.
Then near unto Westchester,
I taken was at last,
And then in Chester Prison
I suddenly was cast,
From thence brought unto Hereford
to answer what was past,
And for, etc.
But when my loving Father,
his Gold he did not spare,
To save me from the Gallows,
he had of me great care,
But it wodld not be granted,
the Gallows was my share,
And for, etc.
My fault it was so heinous,
it would not granted be,
I must for an example,
hang on the Gallow tree,
God grant that I a warning
to all young men may be,
And for, etc.
O my dear loving Father,
he was to me most kind,
He brought me up most costly,
so was his tender mind,
But I indeed to lewdness
was too too much inclined,
And for, etc.
He brought me up in Learning,
his love to me was still,
He thought it all too little,
he did bestow on Will,
But when he looked for comfort,
his heart I then did kill,
And for, etc.
I might have had a marriage,
my Father to content*
And that my loving Mother,
would give her hearts consent.
But I had took such courses.
does make us all repent,
And for, etc.
Now young men take warning,
you see my fall is great,
O call to God for mercy,
Gods grace do you entreat,
I might have lived bravely,
and had a gallant seat,
And for, etc.
O Lord I now crave pardon,
with a relenting heart,
I know my sins are heinous,
I Am very sorry for it:
Alas I have deserved,
a very hard report,
And for mine offense I must dye.
