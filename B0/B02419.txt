The Country-mans care in choosing a Wife: OR, A young Bachelor hard to be
pleased.
A Wife he will have, yet will be sure to choose
One that he loves, the rest he does refuse;
And many sorts of Maids, he by has past,
Being all unfit for him; until at last
Upon a Farmers Daughter he does pitch,
That Is a good Huswife, virtuous, neat, and rich.
Tune of, I Will have one I love, etc. Or, The Yellow-hair'd Laddy.




I Am a brisk Youngster,
and fain would be Wed;
And have a good Wife
for to please me in Bed;
But I fear that in choosing,
they should me beguile:
Then i will have one I love,
though I live the less while.
I Will not have a Girl that
is bred at the Court;
For fear she be given
to wanton and sport;
On every Gallant
she is apt for to smile;
Then i will have, etc.
A Citizens Daughter
I dare not to take:
The steps of her Mother
she will never forsake:
She Will make me look out,
you may see them a mile:
Then i will have, etc.
No maker of Buttons,
nor yet of Bone-lace;
Shall e're be my love,
though I dye on the place;
Although they do mince it,
and simper and smile;
Yet i will have one I love,
though I live the less while,




My Hostesses Daughter,
she must be denied;
Because that I fear
she has often been tried;
Be sure she would fit me
at Hedge, or at Style,
But i will have one I love,
though I live the less while,
She that has much Suitors,
and's loath to be won;
And many a Young Man
she perhaps has undone.
It is not her cunning
that shall me beguile:
For i will have, etc.
A Wench that is imperious,
and strives for to rule;
If that I should take her,
you would count me a Fool:
She would make my Noddle
as sore as a Bile;
But i will have, etc.
And she that is proud,
and has naught to begin;
I would not for such a one
give a Sleeves Pin;
As soon as a better,
my Bed she will defile;
Then i will have, etc.
I Will not have a Cook-Maid,
for she is too black;
And when she does sweat,
her Smock sticks to her Back
She Will scold, and she will brawl,
you may hear her a mile:
But i will have, etc.
The Lass that is fair,
to be sure she is proud;
And she that is little,
you know she is loud;
Against a good Husband,
they are apt to revile;
Then i will have, etc.
But now for to tell you
the depth of my mind;
A Rich Farmers Daughter,
I have in the Wind;
For her I will Ride,
if it be forty mile;
And i will have, etc.
It Is she is my Berry,
my Dear and delight;
Who has my affection,
by day and by night:
To her I will go,
and i will make her to smile;
For i will have my own Love,
though I live the less while.
