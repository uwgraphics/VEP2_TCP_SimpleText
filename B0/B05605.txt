PROCLAMATION, For a Solemn Fast and Humiliation*
WILLIAM By the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith;
To (...) Macers of Our Privy Council, Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that
part, conjunctly and severally specially constitute Greeting.
Forasmuch, as, by Reason of many abounding heinous Sins and Provocations; The
Displeasure and Wrath of Almighty GOD is very visible against Us, and Our
People, not only in the sad Calamity, under which the Kingdom Labors, by
reason of the Disappointment, and failing of the Cropped and Fruits of the
Ground, for the Year by past, whereupon such Scarcity and Dearth did ensue;
That the Poor of the Land have generally been Reduced to the greatest
Extremity; But also, by the continuance of such bad VVeather, and so unnatural
a Season, as does sadly threaten the Mil-giving, and Blasting of the present
Cropped, and Fruits of the Ground, to the Increase of that Distress, whereby the
Kingdom is already Afflicted, and in hazard to be ruined, (if God in his Mercy
prevent not) which certainly calls for our deepest Humiliation and most earnest
and fervent Supplications to our gracious God to avert it: Which
Consideration, has also moved the Commission of the late General Assembly, to
Adress the Lords of Our Privy Council, That a Day of Humiliation may be
appointed, and kept throughout this Kingdom; Wherefore, We with Advice of
the Lords of Our Privy Council, appoint and Command a Day of Solemn Humiliation
and Prayer to be observed through this whole Kingdom, that all may put up
fervent Prayers to God, (...) and Forgivenness. And that he would turn away his
Wrath, and keep off deserved Judgment, and yet Graciously bless (...) People
with Seasonable VVeather, for In bringing the Fruits of the Ground. And also,
that above all things, he would bestow on Us and them, his Spiritual and
Heavenly Blessings, by the continuing and prospering of his Gospel, and the
Fruits thereof amongst us. And We, with Advice foresaid, Require and Command
the said Solemn Fast, and Day of Humiliation, to be Religiously Observed and
Kept, by all Ranks and Degrees of People, upon the Days following, viz. In
all the Planted Churches on this side the River of Tay, upon the twenty fifth
day of August Instant, and in all the Planted Churches of the rest of this
Kingdom, upon the Eight Day of September next to come: And in such Churches, as
are Vacant, upon such Days, as shall be Appointed by the Presbytery of the
Bounds. Certifying such who shall Contemn or Neglect the Dutiful Observing and
Keeping of the said Day of Humiliation; They shall be proceeded against, as
Contemners of Our Authorty, and Neglecters of such a Necessary Duty: And seeing,
that on such an Occasion, and for such Causes. God does more especially require
the exercise of Christian Charity and Compassion toward the Poor and Indigent,
whose Pinching Straits and Wants, do at present lay them under the deepest
distress and cry aloud to all for their Help and Relieff, as they expect, and
would wish that God should be gracious to them in the like Case; Therefore, We
do further, with Advice foresaid, seriously Recommend to all Our Good Subjects,
to draw forth and extend their Christian Charity, and Compassion toward the
Poor and Indigent, by a Cheerful, and Liberal and Bountiful Contribution, upon
the said Day of Humiliation and Lords Day thereafter, as the best and most
acceptable Expressions of their Sincerity and Earnestness in the foresaid Duty
And We peremptory Require and Command, that not only the Money to be
Contribute and Collected upon the Days foresaid; But likewise, (if it shall be
found needful,) that all other Money formerly Collected, and still lying in
Church-Boxes, or in the hands of Kirk Sessions, or lent out upon Interest, by
Bonds taken for the Product of such Collections, be instantly uplifted,
employed and wared out for buying of Victual, and other necessars for relief of
the Poor, within the Bounds of the Paroches to which the said Collections and
Bonds do belong. And that at the fight of the Ministers and Elders, with
concourse of such Heretors as shall Join with them, within the said respective
Paroches, by these already Entrusted, or who shall be Entrusted by the said
Ministers and Elders, and Heretors with the over sight of the Poor in the said
Bounds, to the Effect the said Victual, and other necessars, for the relief of
the poor, may be Orderly, and Proportionally distribut among them, effeiring to
their several Indigencies. And We again, Require and Command, all Ministers of
the Gospel, and others foresaid, to apply themselves diligently to the
foresaid pious Work, for the Supplye and Relief of the Poor, as they will be
Answerable to God, and Us thereanent OUR WILL IS HEREFORE, And We Charge you
strictly, and Command, That in continent these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the
Market Cross of Edinburgh, and to the remanent Market Crosses of the Head
Burghs of the several Shires, and Steuarties within this Kingdom, and in Our
Name and Authority, make Publication hereof, that none pretend Ignorance. An
We Ordain Our Solicitor to dispatch Copies hereof, to the Sheriffs of the
several Shires, and Steuarts of Steuartries, and their Deputs, or Clerks to be

thereof, and immediately sent to the several Ministers to the Effect they may
