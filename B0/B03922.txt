^ 1.
YOu noble Lords of high Degree,
that see my dismal Doom,
Have some regard to pity me,
who now, alas! am come
To dye an ignominious Death,
as well it does appear;
While I declare with my last Breath,
the Laws are most severe.
2.
In Scotland was I bred, and born
of noble Parents there;
Good Education did adorn
my Life, I do declare:
No Crime did ever my Conscience stain,
till I adventured here;
Thus have I reason to complain
the Laws are most severe.
3.
In Flanders I the French have faced,
likewise in Ireland,
Still eagerly pursued the Chase
with valiant Heart and Hand:
Why was not I in Battle slain,
rather than suffer here
A Death which Mortals does disdain:
the Laws are most severe.
4.
I did no hurt nor wrong intend,
I solemnly protest;
But merely for to serve my Friend,
I granted his Request,
To free his Lady out of Thrall,
his Joy and only Dear;
And now my Life must pay for all,
the Laws are most severe.
5.
I coming from my Native Land,
in this unhappy time,
Alas! I did not understand
the Nature of the Crime;
Therefore I soon did condescend,
as it does well appear,
And find therein I did offend,
the Laws are most severe.
6.
In the same Lodging where I lay,
and lived at Bed and Board,
My Landlord did my Life betray
for Fifty Pounds Reward:
Then being into Prison cast,
although with Conscience clear,
I was arraigned at the last,
the Laws are most severe.
7.
The Lady would not hear my moan,
while dying Words I sent;
Her cruel Heart more hard than stone,
could not the least relent;
But triumph in my wretched State,
as I did often hear;
I fall here by the Hand of Fate,
the Laws are most severe.
8.
Will not my good and gracious King
be merciful to me?
Is there not in his Breast a Spring
of Princely Clemency?
No, not for me, alas! I dye,
the Hour's drawing near;
To the last Minute I shall cry
the Laws are most severe.
9.
Farewell dear Countrymen, said he,
and this tumultuous Noise;
My Soul will soon transported by
to more Celestial Joys;
Though in the Blossom of my Youth,
pale Death I do not fear;
For to the last I Will speak the Truth,
the Laws are most severe.
10.
Alas! I have not long to live,
and therefore now, said he,
All that have wronged me I forgive,
as God shall pardon me;
My Landlord, and his subtle Wife,
I do forgive them here:
Farewell this transitory Life;
the Laws are most severe.
