THE CASE of SALTPETER.
The Bill now depending is for the free Importation of Saltpeter from all
parts in Amity with their Majesty's for the Term of (...) for the Use of their
Majesty's Ships and Army, and that the Merchants may be furnished with
Gunpowder for their Ships at reasonable Rates.
IN case their Majesty's had a Necessity for Petre, this Bill (being for the
free Importation without Custom) would be prejudicial to them, by raising the
Price in Holland, and so the Dutch would receive the Benefit of this Bill.

But if there were a Custom Imposed of Sixty pounds per Tun, this would fall
the Price in Holland, so that their Majesty's might buy it cheap there for
their own Use, and receive a Benefit by the Customs of what is Imported by
Merchants.

As to the furnishing Merchants Cheap, there is the same Reason for the free
Importation of all Commodities from Holland, which are cheaper there than in
England, and thereby to give the Dutch the Monopoly, for the Interest of their
Money and Pay of their Seamen being so much less than ours, they will always
undersell us.

But it is suspected that this Bill is promoted by private Merchants who (on
Confidence thereof) have bought Petre at the last Sale at Amsterdam, which
began 13 November. last, and intend to Import and sell it here, before the
Arrival of the East India Ships, which are Expected in two or three Months with
Petre sufficient to supply their Majesty's Stores for next Winter: And in the
mean Time there will be great Quantities made in England, and the Stores are
already provided to furnish the Fleet and Army for next Summer; and in Case
there were no Saltpeter in England, the King may be, and is yearly furnished
with what Powder he wants from Holland.
