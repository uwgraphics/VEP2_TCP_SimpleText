A pleasant new Ballad to look upon, How Malt deals with every man.
MAs Malt is a Gentleman,
And has bin since the world began
I never in my lif knew any man
could match with Master Malt sir,
I never knew any match Malt but once,
The Miller with his ^r^nding stones.
you never saw the like sir.
Malt Malt thou are a Flower,
Beloved right well in e'^ry Bower,
Thou can not be missing one half hour,
you never etc.
For laying of his stones so close,
Malt gave the Miller a Copper nose,
S^ying thou and I will never be foes
but unto thee ^^le stick sir,
Malt gave the M^ller such a blow
That from his horse be fell full low,
He taught him his Master Malt to know,
you never etc.
Our Hostess Maid was much to blame,
To steal Malt away from her Dame,
And in her belly hid the same
you never etc.
That when the Malt did work in her head
Twice in a day she would be sped
At night she could not go to bed,
nor scarce stand on her feet sir.
Then came in Master Smith,
And said that Malt he was a thief,
But malt gave him such a bash in ye teeth
you never etc.
For when his Iron was hot and red,
He had such an ach all in his head,
His boon Comrades got him to bed
for he was very sick sir.
The Carpenter came a piece to share
And bid Malt come if he dare,
He Would thwack his sides and belly bare,
and him full soundly beat sir.
Toth fire he went well armed with chips
Malt hit him right betwixt the lips
And made him lame on both his hips,
you never, etc.
The Shoemaker sitting on his seat
At Mr. Malt began to fret,
He said he would the knave so beat
with his sharp Spanish knife sir.
But Malt came peeping through the hall,
And did his brains so fiercely mall
He tumbled round and caught a fall
you never, etc,
The Weaver sitting in the Loom,
He threatened Malt a cruel doom
And made him to expulce the room
or throw him in a Dike sir.
Where at a Court some Weavers kept
And so their Hostess boldly stepped,
Till charged with double pots they slept
you never etc.
The Tinker took the Weavers part
Such furious rage possessed his heart,
He took the pot and drank a quart,
his wits were very ripe sir.
For Malt the upper hand so got
He knew not how to pay the shot
But part without the reckoning pot,
and sound his stomach sick sir.
The Tailor came to grind his shears
And shows to Malt what spleen be hears
But soon they f^ll together by the ears,
and sore each other struck sir.
And when his pressing Iron was hot
He pressed a board instead of a Coat
And sailed home in a feather-bed boat
you never, etc,
The Tinker walking round the pan,
But Malt much feared his deep mouthd-can
Though he had conquered many man
and laid him in the Dike sir.
Yet was the Tinker gladly fain
With Malt to have a bout or twain
Till he again was shot ith brain,
you never etc.
Then bespake the Tinker anon
Ano said he would prove himself a man,
And laid at Malt till his legs were gone.
you never etc.
The Say^or he did curse and ban
He bid the bop so tap the can
I Will have about with Malt anon.
you never etc.
A board they went to try the match,
And long they played at hope and catch,
Till Mau^t bestowed him under a hatch,
you never, etc.
Then came a Chapman traveling by*
With cheaping long his throat was dry.
And at Master Malt must fly,
and furiously him struck sir.
Till having laid at Malt apace.
Great store of blood was in his face
And he was found in such a case,
you never etc.
The Mason came an Oden to make,
The Bricklayer he his part did take
They bound him to the good Ale stake
you never, etc.
Then Malt began to tell his mind
And plied them with Ale, Beer, and Wine
They left the Brick, Axe, Trowel behind,
they could not lay a Brick sir.
Then came the Laborer in his hood,
And saw his two Masters how they stood
He took Master Malt by the hood;
and swore he would him strike sir.
Malt he ran and for fear did weep,
The Laborer he did skip' and leap.
But Malt made him into the mortar leap.
and there he fell asleep sir.
The Glover came to buy a skin,
Malt bit him right above the chin
The Pewter-John came tumbling in,
you never etc.
And laid on heads and arms and joints
Took away Gloves and a gross of points
And swore they would pay him in quarts and pints
you never etc.
Thus of my Song I Will make on end,
And pray my Host to be my friend,
To give me some drink or money to spend
for Malt and I am quiet sir,
