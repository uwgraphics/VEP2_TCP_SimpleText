The Jolly Gentleman's FROLIC: OR, The City Ramble.
Being, An Account of a young Gallant, who Wager'd to pass any of the Watches,
without giving them an Answer; but being stopped by the Constable at
Cripple-gate, was sent to the Counter, afterward had before my Lord Mayor, and
was Cleared by the Intercession of my Lord Mayors Daughter.

To a Pleasant New Tune.




GIve ear to a Frollicksome Ditty,
of one that a Wager did lay
He Would pass any Watch in the City,
and never a Word he would say
But, Dal, derra, rarra, etc.
The Constable spoke to his Watchmen,
brave Boys, it is my Delight,
And Orders have for to catch Men,
who Ramble too late in the Night.
The Humor, etc.
The Streets do Echo, we hear, Boys,
with Madmen coming along;
My Staff is ready, never fear, Boys,
we'll make 'um alter their Song.
The Humor, etc.
Stand, stand, says the Bell-man,
the Constable now come before,
And if a just Story you tell, Man,
I Will Light you home to your own Door:
The Humor, etc.
This is a very late season,
which surely no Honest Men keep,
And therefore it is but just reason,
that you in the Counter should sleep.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
Take away this same Fellow,
and him to the Counter convey,
Although his Frollick is mellow,
he something to Morrow will say.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
Open the Gate, make no scorning,
take Charge of your Prisoner there,
And we will soon in the morning,
appear before my Lord Mayor.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
A Bottle of Claret I Will fill, Sir,
some P^pes of Tobacco, beside.
And if that it now be your will, Sir,
a Bed for you soon we'll provide.
The Humor, etc.
This Frollick soon Echoed the Prison,
the Debtors his Garnish would have;
Without demanding the reason,
whatever they-requir'd, he gave.
The Humor, etc.
The Constable soon the next day, Sir,
this Comical matter to clear,
The Gentleman hurrys straightways, sir,
before my Lord Mayor to appear.
The Humor, etc.
My Lord, give ear to my Story,
while I the truth do relate,
The Gentleman standing before ye,
was seized by me at Cripple-gate.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
I nothing could hear but his Singing,
wherefore in the Counter he lay,
And therefore this morning I bring him
to hear what your Lordship will say.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
Come Friend, the Case does appear now,
that you was in a Mad Fit,
I hope that you may be clear now,
since Sleep has restored you your Wit.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
This Gentleman sure is Distracted,
he is overheated his Brain,
Since he thus silly has acted,
to the Counter I Will send him again.
The Humor, etc. (Sad.)
A Prison sure it will tame him,
and bring him soon to his Sense,
There Is nothing else can reclaim him,
from this his notorious Offense,
The Humor, etc. (Sad,)
O then bespake my Lord's Daughter,
and for him did thus Interceed,
Dear Father, you will hear that hereafter,
this is but a Wager, indeed.
The Humor, etc.
Therefore be pleased, kind Father,
to hear one word more of me,
And show to me so much favor,
this Gentleman may be set free.
The Humor, etc.
Well, Daughter, I grant your Petition,
the Gentleman home may repair,
But yet it is upon this Condition,
of paying my Officers there.
The Humor, etc.
Come Sir, your Fees we require,
you freed are now by the Court,
And all that we do desire,
you will find out some other new Sport.
The Humor, etc.
Thus seeing he might be Released,
if he his Fees did but pay,
He then was very well pleased,
and so went Singing awa^,
The Humor, etc.
