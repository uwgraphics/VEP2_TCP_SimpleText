The Unjust Uncle: OR, The Perjured Maid of Essex's Unfortunate Destiny: Who
having made a solemn Contract with a young Man of that same County, was
persuaded by her Uncle to forsake him and marry another: For which, as a just
Example of her Inconstancy, she died in their Presence so soon as she broke her
Vows.
To the Tune of The Languishing Swain.
Licensed according to Order.

I.
YOu youthful Damsels far and near
Who shall this mournful Ditty hear,
Take care how you prove false in Love,
For there is a Righteous God above,
II.
Who knows the secret Vows you make;
Or when you do such Contract break,
Strange Judgments follows out of Hand,
As by these Lines you will understand.
III.
In Essex lived a Beauty bright,
Her Parents joy and Hearts delight,
Who oftentimes had courted been;
For many came her Love to win.
IV.
Amongst the many Suitors came
A Youth of worthy Birth and Fame:
Fair charming Saint, he often cried,
I love none in the World beside.
V.
The youthful Damsel did reply,
There Is those that has more Wealth than I,
Which you may have full well I know;
And therefore to some other go.
VI.
Said he, My dear, I do declare
Might I enjoy a Lady fair
Of many Thousand Pounds a Year,
I Would slight it all for thee, my Dear,
VII.
Whose pleasant Charms I do adore;
Grant me thy Love, I ask no more,
For that is better worth than Gold:
Let me one pleasant Smile behold.
VIII.
At length the Damsel did comply
Unto the Bonds of Loyalty;
And many Vows betwixt them past,
To love so long as Life should last.
IX.
A piece of Gold he likewise broke:
Which done, these very Words he spoke,
I Will love thee to my Dying-Day;
Then dearest be not drawn away.
X.
If I do break my Vows, said she,
Let me a sad Example be;
And not the least of Mercy find,
If ever once I change my Mind.
XI.
This Promise made, was soon forgot,
Her wealthy Uncle he would not
Yield she should wed her loyal Love;
But break her Vows, and Perjured prove.
XII.
Said he, I have a Match in store,
Worth Forty Pounds a Year, and more;
And you alone must be his Bride:
I dare not break my Vows, she cried.
XIII.
At length he took her to a Fair,
Likewise her newfound Lover, where
They did on sumptuous Dainties feast;
Then then her Sorrows soon increased.
XIV.
He would not let her be at rest,
But did most solemnly protest,
That if she did not change her Mind,
She should of him no Uncle find.
XV.
Poor Heart! through Fear she gave consent
To be his Bride: This done, she went
Unto the Window of the Room,
Where they beheld her dismal Doom.
XVI.
For looking forth into the Fair,
She saw her former Lover there;
Which made her Eyes like Fountains run:
She sighing said, What have I done!
XVII.
She cried, as she her sighs did fetch,
I am a false forsworn Wretch;
Nothing but sad Despair I see:
Oh Uncle, you have ruined me!
XVIII.
And as she made this sad Complaint,
Her Spirits then began to faint:
Then falling dead upon the Floor,
She never stirred nor moved more.
XIX.
When she her Promise made at first,
She wished, if ever she proved unjust,
That God would some Example show
On her, for falsely doing so.
XX.
According to her Wish she found,
As falling dead straight to the Ground.
Lovers by her fair Warning take,
And don't your Vows and Contracts break.
