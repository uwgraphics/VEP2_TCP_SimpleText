The Valiant Virgin; OR, Phillip and Mary;
In a Description of a Young Gentlewoman of Worcestershire (a Rich Gentleman's
Daughter) being in love with a Farmers Son, which her Father despiseing,
because he was poor, caused him to be Pressed to Sea; And how she Disguised
herself in Man's Apparel and followed him; where in the same Ship (she being
very expert in Surgery) was entertained as Surgeons Mate, and how loving to him
(and skillfully to others) she behaved herself in her Office; and he having got
a Shot in the Thigh, how deligent she was to dress him; she never discovering
herself to him until they came both on Shore: Her Father Dyeing whilst she was
at Sea, (He having no more Children then she) they went into the Country to
take Possession of her Estate, and to Marry; To the admiration of all that were
at the Wedding.

To the Tune of, When the Stormy Winds do blow.


TO every faithful Lover
that is constant to her dear,
This Ditty does discover
Affections pure and clear
Affections and Afflictions too,
do in this Story move,
Where Youth, and truth,
obtain the Crown of Love.
A Man of mean Extraction,
brought up in Worc'ster-shiere,
Was guided by Affection
to love a Lady dear,
Whose eyes did show like morning dew,
that does on Lillies lie;
Her face, and grace,
well mixed with Majesty.
She was the only Heiress
unto a Gentleman,
And all her Fathers care is
to marry her to one,
Whose wealth and wit, may fairly fit
a Lady of such worth;
But he, that she
did Love, was poor by birth.
A Farmers son being handsome,
did catch this Ladies heart
So fast in hold, no Ransom
can free it from the Dart:
The Gentleman, when he began
to understand this thing,
Quoth he, I Will free,
my fond daughter in the spring.
The Spring came, and the Pressing
was every where begun;
Her Fathers fears increasing,
did Press the Farmers Son,
No money could Redeem him,
thought she, if he must go,
I Will never, stay here,
but I Will be a Seaman too.
The Second Part.
To the same Tune.
The Gentleman did Press him,
and sent him to the slaughter,
He thought fit to Press the Man
yt would have pressed his daughter;
His wit prevents all her intents,
for on her knees he brought her;
But one, Love gone.
straight the the other follows after.
This Maid with Ingenuity
had every Surgeons part,
A Ladies hand, an Eagles eye,
but yet a Lions heart;
She knew all tents, and instruments,
Salves, Ointments, Oils and all,
That they employ,
in the fight when Soldiers fall.
In man's Aparril she did
resolve to try her Fate,
And in the Ship where he rid,
she went as Surgeons Mate;
Says she, my soldier shall not be
destroyed for want of Cure,
I Will Dress, and Bless,
whatsoever I endure.
Their names Philip and Mary,
who then were both at Sea;
Phil. fought like old King Harry,
but from the Enemy
Poor Philip had received a shot,
through that part of the thigh,
Did join, to's groin,
oh! that shot came something nigh.
Into the Surgeons Cabin,
they did convay him straight,
Where first, of all ye wounded men.
the pretty Surgens Mate,
Though in this trim, unknown to him
did bravely show her Art,
She dressed, and kissed,
the woeful wounded part.
Which she did most mildly dress,
and shed her tears upon it;
He observed, but could not guess,
or find the meaning on it,
Although he would, in tears and blood
often times on Mary call,
And pray, she may,
be there at his Funeral.
Fierce fights at Sea this Couple
did valiantly endure,
As fast as one did aim to kill,
the the other strived to cure;
The Soldier, and the Surgens Mate
did both employ their parts,
That they, each way,
did win all the Seamens hearts.
The Summer being ended,
that they could fight no more,
The Ship came to be mended,
and all men went a shore;
Stout Philip loved the Surgeons Mate
so much he could not be
An hour, or more,
out of his company.
He often viewed her Feature,
and gazed on every part:
(Quoth Philip) such a Creature
is Mistress of my heart,
If she be dead, I Will never wed,
but be with thee for ever,
We Will walk, and talk,
Live, Lie, and Dye together.
Poor Mary full of passion,
to hear him prove so kind,
Ore Joy'd with this Relation,
could not conceal her mind.
But fondly hangs about his neck,
her tears did trickle down,
Says she, I Will be,
still thy true Companion.
Since providence has vanquished
the dangers of the Sea,
I Will never marry whilst I live,
unless it be with thee;
No woman kind, shall ever find
my heart to be so free,
If thou, wilt vow,
but to be as true to me.
E're he could speak, she told h^^
I am thy dearest dear,
Thy Mary thou have brought as^^^^
and now thou holdst her he^^
This man's Atire, I did but (...)
when first I followed thee;
Thy Dove, I Will prove,
but no Surgeons Mate am I
He flung his arms about her,
he wondered, kissed, and wept;
His Mary he did hold so fast,
as if he would have crept
Into her soul and body too,
his eyes in joy did swimm,
And she, as free,
was as fully fond of him.
They both rid toward Worc'ste^
to show how they had sped;
but upon the Road they heard
her Father he was dead,
Two months at least after he pr^^^^
the Farmers Son for slaughte^
In tears, appears,
the sad duty of a Daughter.
Philip having cheered her up,
they rid directly home,
Where (after many a bitter cup^
the Marriage day was come,
Which they in state, did Celebra^^
the Gallants that were there,
Were grave, and brave,
all the best in Worc'ster-shire.
Thus may you by this Couple se^
what from true love does sprin^
When Men love with fidelity
their Mistress; and their King:
when maids show men, true love a^ ge^^
in spite of Fortunes frowns,
They Will wive, and thrive,
for such crosses have their crown*
