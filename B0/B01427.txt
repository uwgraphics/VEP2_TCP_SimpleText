Right Honorable,
THe Lord has this day, here at Philiphauch, near Selkirk, appeared gloriously
for his people. The Rebels Foot are all cut off, and the Horse totally Routed;
many Prisoners are taken, amongst whom are Sir Alexander Leslie their General
Major, their Agitant General Stuart, Sir John Hay, Sir William Rollock,
Colonel Hay, and Sir Robert Spotswood, whom the Earl of Lanerick took, and from
him the Signet, with his own hand: The Particulars are not as yet so well
known, that we can write all; only, God be praised, we have lost no Noblemen,
or chief Officer. This we thought fit to acquaint you with from the Field, that
as you joined with our dear Brethren in Fasting for us, so you may join with
them and us in giving God the praise, who has wrought this and all our works
for us. We hear General Major Monro is landed; and the General Lieutenant
David Leslie will be as active in prosecuting, as God has made him in being
the Instrument of this begun-Deliverance. Let God have all the Glory from you,
and from

Your affectionate friends, Argyle. Crawfurd. Lindsay. William Scot.
Balcleuche. Lauderdaill. Lanerick. Yester. Bargeine. J. Rutherfurd. Forrester.

Philiphauch, the 13 of Septem. 1645.
To the Right Honorable the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Scotland, residing
at London.
