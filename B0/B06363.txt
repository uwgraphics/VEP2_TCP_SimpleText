Unto His Grace, the Marquess of Tweeddale, His MAJESTY'S High Commissioner,
and the Right Honorable Estates of Parliament.
The Magistrates and Town Council of Inverness, for themselves, and the
Community of the said Burgh,
Humbly shows,
THat where in the beginning of May 1689. Call. Mcdonald of Keppoch, and his
Accomplices raised a Band of Men, to the number of a Thousand, and came on a
sudden within a Mile of the Town of Inverness, and threatened them with present
Plunder, Fire and Sword, unless they instantly sent to him the sum of Ten
Thousand Merks; And when the Town in that surprise, not capable to resist him,
thought good to send some of their number to treat with him; Yet he adding
Violence to Violence, detained them Prisoners, and at length extorted from the
Town no less than four Thousand Merks, which having been a manifest Robbery by
Lawless Men, pretending to no warrant whatsoever: the said Town, and the
Inhabitants thereof, ought to have full Restitution, with all Damnages,
notwithstanding of any Indemnity that afterward was given, seeing the same was
neither given to manifest Robbers without any Law or Warrant, nor can it secure
against so great a Violence and Oppression.

May it therefore please Your Grace and Lordships, to give us Warrant for
citing of the said Keppoch, and his Accomplices, not exceeding Ten, to Compear
before Your Grace and Lordships, to answer in the Premises, etc. And if they
failie therein, or that the Parliament shall not sit until the day of
Compearance, then and in that case, to give us Warrant to cite them to appear
before the Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, for the effect foresaid, and
to Declare that the foresaid Money, Spoiled and Robbed, as said is, is to be
restored cum omni causa, any Pretense of Indemnity notwithstanding, According
to Justice, and your Lordships Answer.
