Amantium irae Amoris redintegratio est.
The falling out of Lovers, is the renewing of Love
To the tune of the Meddow brow.




COme my best and dearest,
come sit thee down by me:
When thou and I am nearest,
breeds my felicity:
To verify the Proverb,
would set my heart at rest,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
My fair and chaste Penelope,
declare to me thy mind:
Wherein I have offended thee,
to make the prove unkind:
I never urged the cause
in earnest or in jest,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
Thy beauty gave me much content,
thy virtue gave me more:
Thy modest kind ciuility,
which I do much adore:
Thy modest stately Iesture,
lives shrined in my breast:
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
How dearly I have loved thee,
thou will confess and tell:
More then my tongue can here express,
my fair and sweetest Nell:
Oh had thou bin but true in love,
I had been double blessed:
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
And will thou then forsake me love,
and thus from me be gone,
Whom I do hold my turtle dove,
my peerlesse Parragon:
The Phoenix of the world,
And pillow of my rest:
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
Fair Cynthia the want of thee
does breed my overthrow:
My body in my agony
does melt away like snow.
The plagues of Egypt could no more
torment my tender breast,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
Now I like weeping Niobe
may wash my hands in tears,
Whilst others gain the love of thee
I daunted am with fears.
Now may I sigh and wail in woe,
disasterously distressed.
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
And thus in brevity of time
I sadly end my ditty:
Which here am left to starve and pine,
without remorse or pity.
Yet will I pray that still thou may
remain among the bl^st.
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
The Maids Answer,
To the same tune.




THough falling out of faithful friends
renewing be of love:
A change of time will make amends
a turtle I may prove.
And till that change of time
with patience be thou blessed,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
The trial of Penelope
in me is proved true,
Misdoubt thou not my constancy,
the turtle keeps her hew.
And to her chosen mate
does bear a loyal breast:
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
The faithful knot of love is boun'd
I rest thy dear for ever*
Thy pining heart with bleeding wound
is cured by the giver.
The shaft of love I shot
returns into my breast,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
I made but trial of thy heart,
how constant it would be:
And now I see thou will not start
nor fleet away from me:
Though Cressida I prove,
yet Troylus thou will rest.
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
Account me for no woman kind,
if I undo the knot:
Or bear the false and faithless mind
to have the same forgot,
That once betwixt us two.
were sealed in each breast.
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
The silver Moon shall shine by day,
the golden Sun by night.
Ere I will go that wanton way,
wherein some take delight.
But for Aeneas I
with Dido pierce my breast.
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
Though I have been untrue, unjust.
and changing like the Moon:
Yet in thy kindness do I trust
that I may have this boon:
That sweet forgiveness may
bring comfort from thy breast.
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
You crystal Planets shine all clear
and light a Lovers way:
Let me embrace my lovely Dear,
which was I doubt a stray;
If once I get the same
I Will feed it in my breast,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
Come mourn with me each loving Less
tha^ Cupids darlings be
Green love will change like withered grasss
the same behold in me,
If I had steadfast been
then had my love been blessed,
Amantium irae amoris
redintegratio est.
FINIS.
