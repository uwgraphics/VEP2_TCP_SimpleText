In the praise of Typography
BLush not to see a Virgin pressed
Arts fairest Handmaid, though she is dressed
In Sable and in Argent, for
Her Coat is Nobler than of Or:
Black makes her Beauty spots, and White
Concenters to complete Delight:
Yet know unto her Dowry's due
Something for the Interview:
And if your Liberal looks commend
Her feature, she will remain Your Friend,
Not unto Death, for know that She
Can give you Immortality.
Fo Vaux.
