(...) and the Maids Happiness. OR, A pretty Dialogue, between two amorous
Lovers.
The Young Man Wooed the Damosel fair,
and soon obtained her faivour,
So they became a loving pair,
it was fit that he should have her.
For now they sweetly do agree;
their minds in nothing vary,
But Thomas vows he will constant be,
unto his pretty Mary.
To the Tune of, My Father gave me House and Land.


AS lately I to take the fresh Air;
within the fields was walking,
There did I epsy a Damosel fair,
that with a brave Lad was talking.
She was indeed a lovely Lass,
I never saw a sweeter;
And he a gallant young Man was,
who with these kind words did greet her.
Man. Come hither to me my Amorous Girl,
for dearly I do love thee,
Thy person is far more precious than Pearl
and I prise no one above thee.
O! therefore be not coy my dear,
thou have no cause to fly me.
I Will do thee no harm, thou needst not fear
then prithee Love sit down by me.
And if my suit thou will but own,
my mind I will discover,
And it shall plainly be made known,
that I am thy unfeigned Lover.

Maid. Hands off good Sir pray let me be gone
to me you are but a stranger,
And if I should tarry with you all alone,
I fear it would breed much danger.
But if you really be my friend,
and mean no harm to do me;
Pray tell me quickly to what end,
you have spoken these words unto me.
For certainly until that I,
by chance came lately hither,
In any p^ace or company,
we two were never together.

Man. It Is true my Dear, I must confess,
thou speak but what is reason,
For I never had the happiness,
to see thee before this season.
Yet I have heard much of thy worth,
by many a true relation,
Thy name exceedingly is set forth,
with praise and commendation.
For in that precious breast of thine,
such Virtues rare are dwelling,
Thy person seems to be divine,
all other far excelling.
Thy Beauty it does shine most clea^,
and so comely is thy Feature,
That thou art admired far and near,
to be a most peerless Creature.
Thy courtesy to all appears,
and thou haste a most lovely Carriage,
O! that to rid me of all fears,
thou were joined with me in Marriage
For therefore it is that hither I come,
to do my best endeavor,
Resolving never more to go home,
until I have gained thy favor.

(...)
THen prithee love let me know thy mind
swet let my speeches move thee
And let my suit acceptance find,
for dearly I do love thee

Maid. Your praises are far above my desert,
yet I humbly thank you for them,
If that they proceed from a faithful heart,
for otherwise I do abhor them.
But though your words and speeches be fair,
and your tongue runs very nimble,
Yet well it behooves me to have a care,
for young men they will dissem^le.

Man. O do not think that I flatter my (...)
but put me unto the trial,
A faithful mind I ever did b^ar,
and my heart unto thee is loyal.
I would not falsifye my words,
nor alter my affections,
For all the wealth that the world affords
for I hate such unworthy actions,
My love is wholly fixed on thee,
my mind shall never vary,
But I will always constant be,
unty my lovely Mary.
Then prithee Love let me know thy mind,
sweet let my speeches move thee,
And let my suit acceptance find,
for dearly I do love thee.

Maid. Sweet sir I perceive by what you say,
you have a desire to Marry,
Yet let me be well advised I pray,
for fear that I should miscary.
Such charges goes to a married Life,
as are not easily gained,
And if that I should become your wife,
pray how shall I be maintained.

Man. I that my Dear, be all thou do fear,
the matter will soon be decided;
For I have five hundred pounds a year,
then am not I well provided,
When ever thou wants either silver or gold,
if that thou do but crave it,
Though it be as much as thy Apron will hold,
yet thou shall quickly have it.
Then prithee Love let me know thy mind
sweet let my speeches move thee,
And let my suit acceptance find,
for dearly I do love these.

Maid. Why then sweet Sir, to you I yield,
^^^hout any more denial,
(...) kind request shall be fulfilled,
and I hope you will be loyal.
Therefore appoint our Wedding day,
that as we our troth have plighted,
Even so we may, without farther dela^
be unto each other united.

Man. How pleasant is my true Loves voice,
like Music sweet it sounds,
Because thou have confirmed my choice,
my heart with joy abounds
Here take my hand thou pretty one,
who have my heart already,
I Will constant be to thee alone,
my love it is firm and steady.
And since thou with me, so well do agre^
my pretty amorous Lady,
Our Nuptial Rites performed shall be,
with as much speed as may be.
Then will I strive to please my Love,
and answer all her wishes,
And eke embrace my Turtle-dove,
with thousands of sweet kisses.
So shall we live in true content,
and never be offended,
But spend our days in merryment,
until our lives are ended.

FINIS.
