THE CASE OF THE Makers of QUILTS for BEDS only.
I. THAT depriving the Quilt-Makers of the Liberty of using Printed Callicoe
Carpets, will be a Detriment to the Government, as to the Customs and Duties,
and also to the Woollen Manufactures; there being great Quantities of Norwich,
Kidderminster, Kendal, and other Stuffs, used for the Backsides of Quilts;
besides abundance of Ordinary Wool, which must otherwise be thrown away; it
being too short for Spinning, and fit for no other Use.

II. That the Callicoes used in making Quilts, are cut into square Pieces, and
printed in Form of a Carpet, which renders them unfit for Clothes or Garments
of any kind: Neither can they be used in Household Furniture any otherways but
in Quilts, being only fit for that Purpose.

III. That Linen Cloths and Woollen Stuffs, are not proper for Quilts, the one
being Cold and Heavy, and the Woollen will harbor Filth and Dirt, and be much
of the same kind as Rugs are; and not being capable of being cleaned so well as
Callicoe Carpets, renders them altogether unfit for that Purpose: For the whole
Design in having Quilts for Beds, is, to have them Light and Warm, and made of
That which will clean often, and not harbor Filth and Dirt, as the Rugs used
to do.

IV. Therefore, It is humbly prayed, That a Clause may be inserted in the said
Bill, To preserve the Use and Wear of Printed Callicoe Carpets in Quilts for
Beds only; there being nothing so proper for that Use: The same being no-ways
prejudicial to any of the Manufactures of this Kingdom, but rather an
Encouragement; and also imploys abundance of Poor in Working up the same.
