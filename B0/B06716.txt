royal blazon or coat of arms

COme hither Friends and listen unto me,
and hear what shall now related be,
For joy and comfort is now come to yea,
and happy days in England you will see:
The King and Parliament now are agreed,
to ease our sadness,
with joy and gladness,
And for to free us from all our annoy
as by the Parliament now is decreed,
then let us sing boys,
God save the King boys,
Drink a good health and sing Vi vel a Roy.
The first of May to our great comfort,
by our good King a Message was sent,
the which ye Parliament received with concord
and sent abroad the Land to content.
For so Lords and Commons together agreed
with their free consent,
and being well bent,
For they will suffer none us to destroy,
the which does both our joy and comfort breed.
then let, etc:
The eight of May as my muse does here sing,
Royal King Charles with a full consent
Was then proclaimed Englands fair King.
by Lords and Commons of Parliament.
And by the heavenly powers divine,
and in Londons City
The cause of this Ditty
Unto all this Nation now tell of this joy
the which unto the same did incline.
then let, etc.
The two houses in the Palace Yard
General Monk himself being by,
Proclaimed the King with great regard,
their acclamation reached the sky,
From thence they marched along the Strand,
Unto Temple-barr,
whereas they met there
The Citizens all with exceeding joy.
they generally without command
Cried God save the King boys,
the Earth did ring boys,
they cast up their hats and cried Vi vel a Roy.
The Lord Mayor and Aldermen in velvet gowns,
and over their heads their hats they did wave,
Not caring at all the spending their Crowns
rejoicing that Charles his birthright should have
The City Horse and their trained Bands
this triumph did grace,
each man in his place,
Did shout for the good we now shall enjoy,
the people shouted and clapped their hands,
Crying God save the King, etc.
Through fair London City we well understand
ye loud sounding trumpets ye sam did proclaim
The like Echo never has bin in this Land
then let these three Nations rejoice for ye same,
And all good people that in them remain
All men did rejoice
with heart and with voice
Which all our sorrow at once did destroy
for joy that Charles his right he shall gain.
then let us sing boys
God save the King boys
Drink a good health and cry Vi vel a Roy.
The Bells in the City did answer them then,
such gallant music has seldom bin heard,
The Trumpets returned their Ccco again,
no heart from rejoicing at that time was har'd,
For the greatest number were all of one mind,
at every stand,
the Mayor did command
The founding trumpets to proclaim the joy,
the City in this great comfort did find,
then let, etc.
The City so high'y did prize the same,
and for to show their ardent desire,
The City seemed all in a flame,
the which thousands then did admire,
Such vast charges men did then bestow,
the truth for to tell,
the City did excel,
So great was their expressions of their joy,
no greater Joy could be here below.
then let, etc.
The Lords and Commons likewise were glad,
to see the people so soon to comply,
Many were revived that were sad,
for there were none that to join did deny.
This glorious sight was most tryumphant,
so great wa^ the noise
expressing their joys,
And the peoples hearts were filled with such joy,
not one was heard to make any complaint.
then let, etc.
Many brave Gallents are gone to the King
to bear such a present as never was sent
Heretofore, and we hope they him will bring
for to be crowned by this Parliament:
Cheer up fair England rejoice and be glad,
the rights they will restore,
as was here-to-fore,
And all offenses they quite will destroy,
and no one shall then have cause to be sad,
then let, etc.
This famous City great Jove defend them,
their grave Messengers from them are gone,
Unto the King for to recommend them
unto him the Citizens every one,
Heaven bless those Messengers that faithful be,
trust is reposed,
their minds inclos^d
For his Subjects welfare is all his joy,
by his Declaration at large you see.
then let, etc.
And now to conclude the eight of May,
caused all Englishmen loud for to sing,
It was a joyful and happy day.
Bon-fires did burn and the Bells did ring,
Then let us praise our great God above,
he has brought to pass,
the like never was,
Such great acclamations of exceeding joy,
by fame performed and the God of love.
then let us sing boys,
God save the King boys,
Cast up your Caps and cry Vi vel a Roy.
