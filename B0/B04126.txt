The lamentable fall of Queen Elenor, who for her Pride and wickedness by Gods
judgments sunk b^^^^ the ground at Charing Cross and rose at Queen hive.
To the tune of Gentle and Courteous


When Edward was in England King
the first of all that name,
Proud Elenor he made his Queen,
a stately Spanish Dame.
Whose wicked life and sinful pride,
through England did exc^l.
To dainty Dames and gallant Maids,
this Queen was known full well.
She was the first that did invent
in Coaches brave to ride,
She was the first that brought this Land
t^ ^eadly sin of pride.
No E^glish Tailor here could serve
to make her rich attire,
But sent for Tailors into Spain
to feed her vain desire.
They brought in fashions strange and new
with golden Garments bright,
The Farthingale and mighty Ruffs,
with Gowns of rich delight.
Our London Dames in Spanish pride
did flourish every where,
Our Englishmen like women then,
did wear long locks of hair.
Both man and child, both maid and wife
weary drowned in pride of Spain,
And thought the Spanish Tailors then
our English men did stain.
Where at the Queen did much despite
to see our English men,
In vestures clad (...) brave to see
as any Spaniard then.
She craved the King that every man,
that wore long locks of hair,
Might then be cut and polled all
or shaven very near.
Whereat the King did seem content,
and soon thereto agreed.
And first commanded that his own
should then he cut with speed.
And after that to please his Queen
proclaimed through the land,
That every man that wore long hair,
should poll him out of hand
But yet this Spaniard not content,
to women bore a spite,
And then requested of the King
against all Law and right,
That every womankind should have
their right breast cut away,
And then with burning Irons seared,
the blood to stanch and stay.
King Edward then perceiving well
her spite to women-kind,
Devised soon by policy,
to turn her bloody mind.
He sent for burning Irons straight,
all sparkling hot to see,
And said O Queen come on thy way,
I will begin with thee.
Which words did much displeass the Queen,
that penance to begin,
But asked him pardon on her knees,
who gave her grace therein.
But afterward there chanced to pass
along brave London streets,
Whereas the Mayor of Londons wife
in stately sort she meets.
With music mirth and melody
unto the Church they went
To give God thanks that to the Lord Mayor,
a noble Son had send.
It grieved much this spightful Queen
to see that any one*
Should so exceed in mirth and j^y,
except her self alone:
For which she after did devise,
within her bloody mind*
And practiced still most secretly,
to kill that Lady kind.
Unto the Mayor of London then
she sent her Letters straight,
To send his Lady to the Court,
upon her grace to wait,
But when the London Lady came
before proud Elenors face,
She stripped her from her rich array,
and kept her vile and bose.
She sent her into Wales with speed,
and kept her secret there,
And used her still most cruelly,
that ever man did hear
She made her wash, she made her starch,
she made her drudge always,
She made her nurse up Children small,
and labor night and day
But this contented not the Queen,
but showed her more despite.
She bound this Lady to a Post,
at twelve a clock at night.
And as poor Lady she stood bound,
the Queen in angry mood,
Did set two Snakes unto her breast,
that sucked away her blood.
Thus died the Mayor of Londons wife
most grievo^^ for to hear,
Which made the Spaniard grow more pro^^
as after shall appear.
The wheat that daily made her bread
was bolted twenty times,
The food that fed this stately Dame,
was boiled in costly wines.
The water that did spring from ground
she would not touch at all,
But washed her hands with dew of heaven
that on sweet Roses fall.
She bathed her body many a time,
in Fountains filled with milk.
And every day did change attire,
in costly Median silk.
But coming then to London back
within her Coach of gold
A tempest strange within the S^yes
this Queen did there behold.
Out of which storm she could not go,
but there remained a spaes.
Four horses could not stir the Coach,
a foot out of that place.
A judgment lately sent from heaven
for shedding guiltless blood,
Upon this sinful Queen that slew
the London Lady good.
King Edward then as wisdom wil'd
accused her of that deed,
But she denied and wished that God
would send his wrath with speed.
If that upon so vile a thing
her heart did ever think,
She wished the ground might open wide
and therein she might sink,
With that at Chairing-Cross she sunk
into the ground alive,
And after rose with life again,
in London at Queen-hive.
When after that she languisht sore,
full twenty days in pain,
At last confessed the Ladies blood,
her guilty hands had stain,
And likewise how that by a Friar
she had a base born child,
Whose sinful lusts and wickedness,
her marriage defiled.
Thus you have heard the fall of pride,
a just reward of sin,
For those that will forswear themselves,
Gods v^ngeance daily win,
Beware of pride ye London Dames,
both wives and maidens all,
Bear this imprinted in your minds,
that pride may have a fall.
