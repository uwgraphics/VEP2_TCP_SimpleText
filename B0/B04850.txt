A PROPER NEW BALLAD, Being the Regrate of a true Lover, for his Mistress
Unkindnesse.
To a new Tune, I Will ever love the more.
I WIsh I were those Groves, dear heart.
which could thy hands inshrine;
Then should no sorrow grief nor smart,
molest this heart of mine:
But since the Fates does this deny,
which leaves me to deplore,
My dribling eyes shall never dry,
until thou love me more.
But O that I might shrouded be
within (...) armis or thine,
And that my soul might say of thee,
that thou were freely mine:
(...) I would,
then doubtless still ad^^^e,
And so in spite of Fate I should,
essay to love thee more.
I shall defy that mortal Wight,
enjoy thee w^o^e will,
Then I to soar an h^g^er flight
in love, or mount me till:
But since to one I must resign,
thee quite and give thee over,
I Will love him, for that face of thine,
which made me love thee more,
Nay sure same sacred Angel haunts,
within that heart of thine,
Whose secret power any soul enchants,
which from thy eyes do shine:
But O that I could thee inflame,
(...) I (...) him implore,
That so by reason of the same,
thou yet might love me more.
But happy is thy servent sure,
that sure a love enjoies,
Whose smiles does all disasters cure,
whose frowns breeds all annoies:
As Phoebus breaking through the cloud,
gives heat and light in store,
So when thou does thine eyes unshrude,
they make me love thee more.
I wish were a Hauk to sour
within the sky of love,
And that thou metamorphos'd were
into a turtle Dove:
There would I catch thee with delight,
with pleasure plum there over,
And (...), should n^^^ ^eath our flight,
attempt to love thee more.
Thy face is as a heaven which holds
two shining suns of love,
The which thine eyelids clouds infold,
in ivorie Orbs they move:
Their absence makes me like to die,
their presence burns me sore,
So still in these extremes I lie,
and yet must love thee more.
To long betwixt these ivorie hills,
which in thy bosom dwells,
From whence the sugared nectar trils
in sweetness that excels:
There would I surfeit with delight,
my self, and never give over,
Till love should so our saul's unite,
as ay to love thee more.
I like the Salamander am,
that in the fire remains,
And not consumed with the flame,
I live in pleasant pains:
O that these bodies were to act,
as free as minds to soar,
Then surely I at length would make
my Less to love me more.
Since of the days desires our dreams,
the true ideas are,
I wish that of mine eyes the beams
in sleep enclosed were:
That slumbring I might thee possess,
whom daily I adore,
For waking I scare scarce transgress,
and yet must love thee more.
But yet if thou would condescend
unto my dear request.
And suffer me my health to spend,
upon thy candid breast;
Then surely I* or ever let,
imperiously would soar,
^s praising thee at highest rate,
and so would love thee more.
Some comfort unto those belong,
who common lovers be,
Since they upon surmise of wrong,
can set their fancy free:
But should I die by thy disdain,
which others would abhore,
My pure affection shall unstained,
aspire to love thee more.
Then let not black ingratitude,
so dear a Saint disgrace,
For it would taint the finest blood,
and stain the fairest face:
Since thou may love, and yet be chaste,
and still behind have store,
Then slight not him, who does attest
the gods, he will love thee more.
FINIS.
DIAPHANTAS Words to CARIDORA upon a Disaster.
THe swettest saint incenc'd may be.
and for a moment moved,
To wrath by some disaster hie,
against her best beloved:
But let it be, I were thy foe;
as first I Will lose this breath,
Thou should not suffer down to go,
the Sun upon thy wrath.
I Will only curse the sulten Star,
revealed th'unhappie hour,
Which did me from thy presence bar,
by his malignant power.
That Planet I shall still allow,
while as I here remain,
Whose blessed aspect shall bring me to,
my first estate again.
But yet these strains which I to thee,
in favor did impart,
Thou slighted them, which threw on me
a deadly wounding dart:
And yet I shall be loath to grieve
thee in the least degree,
For thou shall Charidora l^^ve,
I Diaphantas (...).
In holy writs heavens pardons such,
as true as infants be,
But I could wish to weep as much
for sins, I mourn for thee:
Resemble then these heavenly powers,
and grant him thy good will,
Who wishes all to you and yours.
that heaven can bring you till.
How like am I unto an night?
that dwells beneath the Pole,
Who entertains a six months night
before their sun does role:
Since in thy absence night does lie,
thy presence shines clear,
Lend but the twilight of thine eye,
to make my day appear.
So shall my leaden spirits rise,
from out this bed of care,
To welcome thee into our skies,
which now in darkness are:
But if my suit thou shall deny,
and render frowns for love,
Then shall that stain upon thee lie,
while I shall constant prove.
The ship that cuts the aisure tide,
and from her course is driven
By tempest, the magnettick guide,
yet brings her to the haven;
So we in midst of Natures main*
when passions storms do blow,
Are driven averse, yet back again*
by love are led also.
Since grace and natu^ does agree,
things striving to restore,
Shall such a stain be found in thee?
the saint whom I adore,
As to deny for to be led
by grace, and stay thine ears,
O do not, lest for thee I shed
my sanguine drops in tears,
FINIS.
