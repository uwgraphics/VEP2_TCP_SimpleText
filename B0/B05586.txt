are expected for the same purpose; and t^^ Men are clapped up in Pri^ons, and
detained until there be an opportunity to se^^ them away to France, And as we

this occasion to renew our positive Commands, T^a^ our Council be careful tha^
no men be levied or sent out of Scotland by any conivance whatsoever. Like^^^^
We, with advice of the Lords of our Privy Cou^^il, do command and charge, That
none of our Subjects or others within this Kingdom presume to levy or transport
any men out of our said Kingdom upon any pretense whatsoever, unto the service
of any beyond the Sea now in war. And we strictly require all the Magistrates
and Officers of our Customs in all the Seaports of this Kingdom, to be careful
in their several Jurisdictions, that this our Command be punctually obeyed. And
further, We, with advice foresaid, do command and require the Magistrates of
Burghs immediately to set at liberty any men whom they shall find to be kept
in Prison in order to their transportation, and to return to our Co^^^^d the
names of any persons so imprisoned, and the names of these who ap^reh^^ded
them. And ordains these presents to be Printed and Published at the
Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places ^^^^ful, that none pretend
ignorance.
