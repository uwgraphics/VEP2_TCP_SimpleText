To each Gentleman S^dier in the Company (...) Captain John Hulls, Captain in
the YELLOW Regiment of Trained Bands of London.
THO your great Actions I need not rehearse,
(They speak your Worth beyond my homespun Verse,)
Yet Custom once a Year obliges me
T'applaud your long-experienc'd Loyalty:
Wherefore, Great Sirs, all that is desired by me,
Is, that my Offering may accepted be;
Being made unto you with a free good Will,
Although I cannot pretend to the Poet's Skill.
When the Bold French (last Year) had an Intent
Us to Invade, the YELLOW Regiment
First took up Arms, meaning thereby to show
All Loyal Subjects what they ought to do
For their dear Country, and its Warlike King,
Whose Valor through the whole Universe does ring.
When the Six Reg'ments Marched unto Hide-Park,
(Each Man accoutred like a Warlike Spark)
You were the Van, the Place of Honor due
(Brave Heroes of the YELLOW) unto you:
The admiring Crowd afforded you Applause,
Crying, Behold the Glorious YELLOW Boys,
Whose Loyalty has ever steadfast been
Unto our most auspicious King and Queen,
William and Mary whose great Worth will be
Recorded unto all Posterity.
And when their Majesty's were pleased to say
They Would grace the Triumph of the Lord Mayor's Day,
The YELLOW then was pitched upon to be
Their chiefest Safeguard and Security.
Thus upon all Occasions you are free
To signalize your Zeal and Loyalty
To your Dear Country and His Majesty.
For which long may you live, until you see
All Enemies to England's Monarchy
Fall down before your Arms and Loyalty.
May sacred Heaven always propitious be
To Great King William and his Consort Mary,
Is the good Prayer, and shall be to the End,
Of your most faithful Marshal and your Friend
Thomas Hawki^^
