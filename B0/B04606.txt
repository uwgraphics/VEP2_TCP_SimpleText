The old man's life renewed by Heavenly providence. OR,
A strange (yet true) relation of one Mr. Macklian, a man of an hundred and
sixteen years old who when he was about the age of fourscore years old, his
strength failed him, and his eyesight grew dim; he was likewise deaf of
hearing, and feeble of speech, but now of late the Lord has shown such a
miracle upon him, that he is now become as a young man again; for his hearing
and speech is come perfectly to him, and ^is eyesight is so good that can
write or read the smallest print that is, without Spectacles ^is teeth which
were decayed and rotten out of his head, there are new ones come in their
places: and having lost the old hair from off his head, there is now fine
young tender hair growing upon the same, like the hair of a Child of two years
old. All these strange Wonders are to be seen upon the Gentleman, whose name is
Mr. John Macklain, dwelling and living (so long as Gods pleasure is) in
Northumberland, in the Town of Lesbury, he being the Parson and Minister of the
Parish preaches two Sermons every Sabbath day, where many hundreds of people
comes far and near to hear him Preach and to see the wonders of the Lord.

The Lord that rules both heaven and earth
with his Almighty powerful hand
Has many strange examples sent
unto the people of England:
But never the like of this before
was known or seen of any man,
In those same parts wherein we live,
since first of all the world began.
Therefore with patience now give ear,
and hearken to the matter well:
The truth, and nothing but the truth,
I am prepared for to tell.
(...) Lesbury in Nor^humberland
one Master Macklain dwelling there,
He parson of the Parish was,
and well beloved far and near:
A hundred and sixteen years of Age,
this Minister is known to be,
Whose eyes through age were grown so dim
that he at all could hardly see,
His Legs and Joints so feeble were,
that he could hardly stand or go,
His strength and hearing was decayed
so was his tongue and speech also.
But still he did the best he could,
among his Parishoners to preach,
Being well known in former time,
the way of godl^nesse to teach,
Yet some that spightful neighbors were,
which then were dwelling there about,
Did use all means that they could do,
by violence for to turn him out
And said because he (...)
there Minister he (...)
The reason why, (...)
nor could (...)
But (...)
My friend and kindred are decayed,
my wife and children dead and gone,
No one have I to take my part,
but only Christ my Lord alone.
Therefore if it be thy will, O Lord,
out of this world me for to take,
Or else to send me some relief,
even for thine own sweet mercies sake.
Now mark the wonders of the Lord,
what miracles were brought to pass
Upon that aged Minister,
(...) I will tell you how it was.
The miracles are only these,
that God in mercy has restored,
Him to his former strength again,
an^ comfort does to him afford.
His age seems now to be renewed,
as to the world it may appear,
Though he before was almost dead,
he now can very well speak or hear:
His ^yes that were so dusk and dim,
an^ also sunk into his head,
Are now so quick and lively grown,
that without spectacles he can read,
And ^ince his teeth were rotten out,
there new ones come in the old ones place
His b^ows, and cheeks are fat and fair,
wrinkls worn out of his face,
And to be brief the limbs of his,
are every one revived again,
From head to foot from top to toe
(...) the world appears pl^
An^ ^ow he do (...)
