The AUTHOR's Necessary Advertisements FOR The better Use of the ensuing
MEDITATIONS.
THere are many People already advanced in Prayer, who cannot away with long
Meditations. Some, because they have not time enough to read them. Others,
because they have not a Memory good enough to retain them. Besides, their
Understanding seeing that ready made, which it was to have wrought out, and
finding without difficulty, what it was to have searched out by its discourse
becoms slack and negligent, and does ordinarily wander away in those vast
Regions, which are discovered to it. Whereas having but a little matter to
meditate upon, it retains it without difficulty, it relishes it with Pleasure;
because every Workman loves his own Handiwork, which has cost him so much pains
to make.

A Hunter, who has been a long time in quest of his Game, finds much joy when
he has discovered it. The discovery of a Truth, makes a greater impression upon
the Soul, that finds it, than a hundred that are proposed to her.

She acknowledges better the effect of the favor, when being in a barren and
waterless Desert, she sees a Heavenly Manna fall down from Heaven for to feed
her, and Waters break forth in abundance out of the bosom of Rocks for the
quenching of her Thirst.

The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a grain of Mustard Seed, which is very
small; but when it is beaten and pounded, it warms the Stomach.

We must not load our Mind with too much Matter, no more than our Stomach with
too much Meat: otherwise, it will not be able to digest it. For that reason,
St. Ignatius, that great Man of Prayer, in his Book of Exercises, gave us very
short Meditations. And the more one advances, the less matter he gives; to the
end that the Soul may put her Confidence in God, and may beg Lights of him,
apply her own Powers, expect his Succor, and sensibly acknowledge what she has
from her self, for her Humiliation thereby: and what she receives from God,
that she may thank him for it.

There is a great difference between a Lecture and a Meditation. He who reads a
good Book, ought to understand what he reads without pain, and without labor.
Truth ought to present it self to his Understanding, without his being obliged
to search after it. But he who meditates, must by his reasoning dig in the
Evangelical Field, that he may find the Treasure of Grace that lies hid
therein. It Is true that all the World are not capable of busying themselves,
and framing Discourses. And indeed, that very Reason has obliged some very
Learned Men of our Time to Publish long Meditations, wherein Truths are
propounded in all their force, and in all their extent, that those who have not
such penetrating Wits, might help themselves by their Reading, and have nothing
more to do in their Prayer, but to have an affection for what they Read. But
those who have their Wit quick, active, curious, earnest, and solid, require
much Matter to busy themselves with, and are like unto Fire, which goes out
when it has no more Fuel.

I confess that it is a hard matter to content all the World, yet I dare be so
bold as to promise my self, that both the one and the other, will be fitted
with the Meditations, which I present them. Those who desire but a little
Matter, will find in one only Line employment enough for a long time. Those who
desire a great deal, by passing from one line to another, will rather want
time, than matter for their entertainment.

Learned Persons will without difficulty find out, that most part of the
Propositions, of which these Meditations are made up, are Sentences of the Holy
Fathers, translated word for word into our Language. I was once in the mind to
have quoted them in the Margent. But having considered, that such like
Citations are only for Books of Doctrine, and that R.F. Pontus has not made them
in his Meditations: I thought I might dispense with my self therein. But
instead of the Passages out of the Holy Fathers, I have set down some out of the
Scripture for the maintenance of the Truths, which are in these Meditations,
and for to give them, as I may say, a little seasoning: for the words of Men
are flat and insipid, without the salt of the Word of God: nor do they make
that impression in Hearts, as the Sacred Text is wont to do, whose Weight and
Authority do persuade men's Minds more efficaciously, than all human
Ratiocinations. Thus those who have a Mind to act by Faith may stop upon the
Scripture Passages: those who have a mind to discourse may take the matter of
the Meditations.

There are Meditations upon almost all Virtues, and upon all Vices, as also
upon all the Mysteries of our Lord, and of our Lady. And because the sense of
these Truths is to be included in one or two lines, it was necessary to make
these Meditations in form of Sentences, and little Verses, for to give them a
more pleasing Cadence, without mingling any Rhimes, which I broke off as much
as I could possible.

I confess you will find some Repetitions therein. But is there any Book of
Meditations wherein there are none? And is it possible to handle so many
Matters so like, without falling into the same thoughts? Moreover, I affirm,
That it is good to meditate the same things three or four times over. For a
Truth that does not touch you at one time, does often touch you at another; as
S. Ignatius takes notice. And for that reason, I voluntarily left some
Repetitions therein, which I might have changed.

As for the order of the Meditations, it is conformable to that of the three
States of a Spiritual Life, to wit, Of Beginners: Proficients, and Perfect:
that every one may without difficulty find Matters conformable to their
Disposition. It Is the Method that F. Ponte makes use of, which I thought fit to
follow.

But for to content those who desire to have different Matter for all the year
long: I have made a Table, which marks out to them for every Day the subject of
their Meditation.

Now, whereas it is not possible to furnish different Matters of this Nature
for a whole year, and because these Meditations are filled with so great a
number of Truths, that each one of them is sufficient to take up several days:
I was forced twice or thrice in the year to give the same subject to meditate
on, leaving it to every one's Devotion to change his Meditation, when that,
which he meets with, pleases him not.

I have for every day proposed the Subjects the most conformable to the Gospel
of the Sunday. Wherefore you would do well to Read it, in the beginning of
every Week. The same thing I have likewise observed on the Feasts of the
Saints: for I give Meditations either on the Virtues which they practiced, or
on the Gospel that is Read on their Mass. Those who shall Read the Abridgment
of their Life, may easily join their Example to the Truth, which they meditate
on.

There are some virtuous Persons, who desire every Month to make the Exercise
of Death: and for to satisfy their Devotion, I have at the end of every Month
put four Meditations for to prepare them thereunto. Those, whom this Devotion
does not please, may make use of the others that are there marked out for them,
or choose those they have a mind to in the first Table, that follows. Now, for
to make profit of these Meditations, this, I conceive, is the Method, they are
to be made in.

After the ordinary Preparations, of which we have spoken in our Method of
Prayer, Read with respect and attention the words of the Holy Scripture: Weigh
each word of them: Make Acts of Faith: and if you find your Mind to be taken
up, stop there without going any further.

But, in case it fix not upon that subject: Read then the first part of your
Meditation, and stop at that Truth, which makes most impression on your Heart:
or else begin by the two first lines. Endeavor to penetrate the sense of them.
Make reflection on your self, and see whether your life be conformable to those
Truths. Conceive a Sorrow, and consequently made good Resolutions.

For example, if you meditate upon Patience, and that you be com to these two
lines, All that I endure is nothing in comparison of the Punishment that I have
deserved. Call to mind for a while the principal Sins of your life: compare the
place that you are in, with that which you ought to be in: the pains that you
suffer, with those that you ought to have suffered. Measure the time of your
pains, with that of Eternity, and see whether you have reason to complain. Say,
If God had don with me according to his justice, where should I now have been?
Am not I better here than in Hell? If I were there, as so many others are,
would not I reckon my self happy to com out from thence for to endure, what I
now endure? Why then should I complain? Does God do me wrong? Have not I
deserved infinitely much more? Push on this Consideration, and press your heart
until it submits it self to God's Orders.

Consequently frame your affections: give thanks to our Lord for his Goodness
and Mercy that he has used toward you. Beg Pardon of him for your Impatiences,
and make resolutions of suffering, better than you hitherto have.

Then you shall pass on to the following line. In comparison of the Glory that
is prepared for me. And you shall meditate on it, as on the foregoing lines:
Thus flying up and down like a Be from flower to flower, until you have found
the honey of Devotion.

But in case nothing do touch you: yet quit not your Prayer for all that: but
remain quiet in the Presence of God: or else make use of the Practices that we
have taught you in the Method of Prayer. You may also Read the words of
Devotion, which are at the end of the Fourth Part; and there doubtless you will
find some comfort.

When at any time you find your self in any extraordinary disposition of Joy,
or Sadness: it will be good, even out of Prayer to entertain your self in this
manner. Lift up your heart to God: beg of him to make known to you his Divine
Will and Pleasure. Then opening your Book, stop at that Meditation on which you
have lighted, and you will oftentimes find therein, what you seek after. The
Providence of God, says the Wise man, plays upon Earth with Men, and takes
delight to manifest it self in casual, and unforethought-of accidents.

Since I am commanded to put my Name to this new Edition, I conjure all
virtuous Persons, through the Charity which they owe to those who are in
misery, to give some place in their remembrance to him, and some share in their
Prayers.

The End of all the TABLES.
The FIRST Meditation. Of the End for which Man was made.
I Came from God. I belong to God.
I subsist only in God.
I live only for to serve God.
As I cannot be but from God,
I cannot be but for God.
It is not necessary that I should be in the World:
But supposing that I am therein,
I must be all God's.
All things speak to me of God.
All things draw me to God.
All things make me know God.
All things tell me, that I deserve not to live,
Unless I live for God.
That I ought not to have a Heart,
Unless I will love God.
That I cannot serve two Masters.
That I must either be the Devil's, or God's.
Whom have I obeyed?
Which of the Two has been my Master?
For whom have I labored?
Whom have I contented?
Alas! it has been the Devil.
This is the Master that I have preferred before God.
I have made my self his slave.
I have don all his Wills and Commands.
Oh, I abhor my infidelity!
I acknowledge my injustice.
I will henceforth be God's.
I will love none but God.
I will live no more but for God.
I will serve none but God.
I will make it an absolute necessity
For me to love and content God.
Lord make mine end known to me, that I may know what is lacking to me, Ps.
38.5.

I have created him, framed him, and made him for my glory, Isa. 43.7.

I am the beginning and the end, Apoc. 2.8.

I have brought up Children, and exalted them; but they have despised me, Isa.
2. v. 2.

II. MED. Of the Dominion of God over his Creatures.
YOU have not always had a Being:
There was a time wherein you were not.
It was God who drew you out of nothing;
'Twas He that gave you a Being.
You are therefore His Creature.
He has an absolute dominion over you.
He may command you what He pleases.
He may put you where He pleases.
He may preserve you, or destroy you:
Raise you up, or pull you down:
Comfort you, or afflict you:
Make you die, or make you live.
As He depends upon none,
So is He answerable to none.
God is your first Beginning.
He is Master of your life.
He is the preserve thereof.
He is the repairer thereof.
You depend upon Him necessarily.
You depend upon him 1. Essentially;
2. Absolutely; 3. Continually; 4. Eternally.
Is it not then just that you should obey
The Master on whom you depend?
He that planted the Vine,
Has he not right to eat of it?
He that built the House,
Has he not right to dwell in it?
What injustice is it to expel God.
Out of a heart, which he framed with his own hands?
From a heart, which he Redeemed with his own Blood?
From a heart, wherein he has a mind to dwell?
From a heart, which he would sanctify?
What a pride is it, for a Vessel of Earth
To murmur against its Maker?
God is your final End.
He created you for his glory.
He desires to make you happy.
It Is for that end he has placed you in this world.
Every thing tends to its own end.
That is the term of its motions.
That is the center of its rest.
That is the beginning of its strength.
The weight of its inclination.
The very top of its perfection.
Out of that end a thing is unhappy.
It is weak: It is vicious.
Ah! why do we not then go to God?
Ah! whence comes it that we quit God?
O my God, and my End!
Thou art the beginning of my life.
Thou art the center of my peace.
Thy hands it were that framed me.
It Is thy hands that conserve me.
It Is thy hands that sustain me.
It Is thy hands that defend me.
I am always in thy arms,
And yet I never think on thee.
I am always in thy heart,
And yet I have no love for thee.
Thy Creatures serve me,
And yet I will not serve thee.
Was it I that made them?
Did I give my life for them?
O my God!
Thou did make me for thy self,
And did more-over die for me.
Thou promisest me eternal goods:
Thou threatenest me with eternal miseries,
And yet all this does not work on me.
And yet after all this I love thee not.
O God my Lord!
Burn thy Heaven. Extinguish thy Hell.
I will have no other reward
For the services that I render thee,
Than the honor of having served thee.
Heaven is too much for him that loves thee.
Hell is too little for him that loves thee not.
O how these thoughts do please me!
I am from God. I am God's.
I am in God. I am for God.
From God, as from my beginning.
God's, as my Sovereign's.
In God, as in my Center.
For God, as for my final End.
Alas! I have lived hitherto,
As though I had been from my self.
As though I were my own.
As though I were for my self.
As though I were sufficient to my self.
O! I will henceforth be all yours.
I will seek no rest but in thee.
I will labor no more but for thee.
The Lord your God is the God of Gods, and the Lord of Lords: great, and
powerful and terrible. Deuteronomy. 20. v. 17.

If I am the Father, where is my honor: and if I be the Lord, where is my
fear? Mal. 1.6.

Thy hands have made me and framed me. Ps. 128.

Who is it that plants a Vineyard, and does not eat of the fruit thereof? 1
Cor. 9.

Who art thou to answer God? Romans 4.

Wilt not thou, O my Soul, be subject to God? Ps. 61.

III. MED. Of the care of our Salvation.
MY Salvation is my business.
My Salvation is my only business.
My Salvation is a very great business.
God from all eternity thinks of this business.
His Son died on the Cross for this business.
Our good Angels labor for this business.
The whole World was created only for this business.
All my happiness depends on this business.
My Eternity roles upon this business.
All the Devils do traverse this business.
I cannot without care speed in this business.
Death will soon put an end to this business.
I am then a Fool, if I do not mind this business.
And yet I neglect this business.
I mind every thing else but this business.
I am restless about all things, but this business.
O, I will mind nothing else but this business.
I will labor no more, but for this business.
One thing is necessary. Luke 10.

What will it avail a man to gain the whole World, if he lose his own Soul?
Matthew. 26. What exchange shall man give for his Soul? ibid.

Attend to thy self. 1 Timothy 6.

Have pity on thy soul, and please God. Eccles. 3.

IV. MED. Of disengagement from Creatures.
I Never found any true pleasure in Creatures.
I never found in them any rest: any assurance: any trust: any fidelity.
They are vain and unconstant.
They are impure and indigent.
They are made for me,
Not I made for them.
They are more vile than I.
I am more noble than they.
They may indeed amuse me,
But they cannot satiate me.
They may disturb my heart,
But they cannot calm it.
My God!
My heart is small in substance,
But it is infinite in its desires.
Though your happiness be never so great,
It is capable of containing it.
Thou have made it for to love thee.
Thou have framed me to thy Image.
It Is a River that seeks out the Sea.
It Is a fire which mounts up to its Sphere.
It Is a ray that would return back again
To the Principle, from whence it took its birth.
It Is a piece of Iron, which, without knowing it,
Would fain unite its self to its Lodestone.
O how unhappy have I been,
When I loved Creatures!
O my God!
Since I am made for thee,
I perceive very well that I never shall
Have any peace or rest but in thee.
Vanity of Vanities, and all is Vanity. Eccles. 1.

In all things I perceived there was Vanity, and affliction of Spirit. Eccles.
2.

Turn, O my Soul, into thy rest, because our Lord has done well to thee. Ps.
114

Why do ye love Vanity, and seek after lying? Ps. 4.

V. MED. Of the Will of God.
I Am in this World only for to do
What God would have me do.
I deserve death if I do not do
What God would have me do.
I shall never be perfect unless I do
What God would have me do.
I shall never be at rest unless, etc.
I must, whether I will, or nill, do
What God would have me do.
I shall be wise as God is,
If I have the same judgment with him.
I shall be just as God is,
If I have the same Rule with him.
I shall be holy as God is,
If I have the same love as he has.
I shall be powerful as God is,
If I will the same things with him.
I shall be happy as God is,
If I have the same pleasure as he has.
All things will obey me as they do God,
If I have the same will with him.
Alas! how miserable was I
Whilst I waged war against God?
All things thwarted my will
Whilst I thwarted the Will of God.
O my God!
Give me not over to my Passions.
Suffer me not to offend you any more.
Destroy my will, lest it destroy yours.
Force me if I will not obey you:
Do your will with me, if I will not do your Will.
Life is in his will. Ps. 26.

As it is his will in Heaven, so be it don. 1 Match. 13.

Not as I, but as thou will. Mark 14.

Let our Lord's will bedon. Act. 2.

Lord, what will thou have me to do? Act. 9.

VI. MED. Of the Obligations we have to love and serve God.
SInce God is the first of all Beings.
Since he has framed me with his hands.
Since he has made me for to love him.
Since he has drawn me out of Hell.
Since he has given his life for me.
Since he has redeemed me with his blood.
Since he feeds me with his own flesh.
Since he quickens me with his Spirit.
Since he promises me his Heaven.
Since he has loved me from all Eternity.
Since he has bestowed infinite benefit upon me.
Since he has pardoned me an infinity of sins.
Since he gives himself wholly to me.
Since I belong wholly to him.
Since I subsist only by his favor.
Since he burns with the love of me.
Since all his desire is
To make me happy as he is himself.
O, I will love him with all my heart*
O, I will never serve any other Master!
O, I will do his will,
And sacrifice my self to his glory!
My God!
Let me cease to live, unless I will live for thee.
Destroy my being, unless I will be thine.
Oppose my desires, if I desire ought else but thee.
Thou art my Servant. Isa. 41.

I am thine. Ps. 118.

Whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lords. Romans 14.

You are not your own; for you have been bought with a great price. 2 Cor. 6.

115.

VII. MED. Profitable thoughts fit for to draw us off from the World.
WHo was it that put me into this World?
To what end am I in this World?
What do I do in this World?
What rest have I in this World?
When shall I go out of this World?
Whether shall I go at my departure out of this World?
What would I wish to have don
At my going out of this World?
Shall I damn my self for the goods of this World?
If I lose my Soul, what will it avail me
To have gained the whole World?
And yet for all that I labor only for the World.
O my God!
Either draw me out of this World,
Or draw me off from this World.
Either make the World die in me,
Or make me die to the World.
Either separate my Soul from her Body,
Or take her off from the affection of the World.
What will it avail a man, should he gain the whole World? Luke 19.

Ye are of this World: I am not of this World. John 8.

O just Father, the World has not known thee. John 4.

Ye are not of this World. John 15.

VIII. MED. Of Death.
YOu must die once: And you will die but once.
You know not when you shall die:
How you shall die: In what place you shall die:
In what state you shall die.
You will die sooner than you imagine.
And unless you take heed, you will die
Before you think of it.
Such is the Death, as is the Life.
One cannot learn in a moment
A Trade which one never practiced.
Nor can one unlearn in a moment
A Trade one has still been at.
After Death you will be judged.
After Judgment you will be in Eternity.
What would you then wish to have don?
What good will these goods do you
Which you have scraped up together.
O Death! O Judgment! O Salvation! O Damnation!
I am a dead man, unless I think of Death.
I am a Mad man, unless I think on Eternity.
I deserve not to be saved,
Unless I fear being damned.
Behold the day of thy Death is at hand. Deuteronomy. 31.

O death, how bitter is thy remembrance to a man who has peace in his Riches?

Be ye therefore prepared, because in the hour that you think not of, the Son
of Man will come. Luke 12.

Dispose of thy house, for thou will die. Isa. 38.

IX. MED. Of the Death of the Just.
WHat a pleasure is it to die,
When we have no pleasure to live?
One quits that without pain,
Which one possesses without affection.
Death is sweet to him
Who has no comfort at all here.
The Soul leaves without repining
A House that does not please her.
A divorce is pleasing to those
That do not love each other.
That which you love during your life,
Will be your torment at your death.
That which afflicts you in this life,
Will be your comfort at your Death.
What can cause any grief
To a spirit disengaged from all things?
Love is as strong as Death.
It prevents what that is to do.
It separates the soul from the body,
And leaves Death nothing to do.
What need is there to pluck up by force
A Heart that cleaves close to nothing.
The Treasure of his merits
Is a possession that cannot be taken from him.
It Is a precious inheritance
That death cannot rob him of.
O what comfort does the sight
Of a good action then afford!
There is nothing in our life that is goodly,
But a fair Gate to get out of it.
Of all the goods that man can desire,
The greatest is to die well.
Death is not dreadful
To him that has lived well.
It is the end of his combats:
And the Crown of his merits.
God preserves in that evil day
The Soul, which has been faithful to him.
He makes her sleep in his bosom.
He strengthens her with his grace.
He allayes her pains.
He dissipates her frights.
He gives order to his blessed Spirits,
To comfort and defend her.
To maintain her in peace,
And to conduct her to Heaven.
O how precious in the sight of God
Is the death of the Just!
O how honorable is this Sacrifice to him!
O how pleasing to him is this Victim!
My God!
May I hope for a good death,
Having led so wicked a life?
It Is true, I have lost my Innocence;
But I may repair it by Penance.
O, I will live like the Virtuous,
That I may die like the Virtuous!
O, I will lead the life of the Just,
That I may obtain the Death of the Just!
Blessed are the dead that die in our Lord. Apoc. 14.

To him that fears our Lord, it shall be well in his extremity: and he shall be
blessed in the day of his departure. Eccles. 2.

Precious in the sight of our Lord, is the death of his Saints. Psalm. 115.

When these things being to be don, look up and lift up your heads, for then
your Redemption is at hand. Luke 21.

Ye shall go forth in gladness, and be conducted in peace: the mountains and
hills shall sing praises before you. Isa. 5.

X. MED. Of the Death of Sinners.
DEath is a great evil: But Sin is a much greater.
But Death joined with Sin,
Is the most frightful of all evils.
It Is an universal evil.
It Is an eternal evil.
It Is an evil without remedy.
It Is the most dreadful threat,
That a provoked God can make.
O, how evil is the death of sinners?
How are they seized with horror?
Seeing themselves e're they are aware,
At the last line of time,
Which they have spent so ill.
Seeing themselves just ready to go
Into the Prisons of Eternity,
From whence they cannot save themselves.
To begin to see what they never saw:
To begin to conceive, what they never before conceived.
To begin to measure,
What they never before considered.
To begin to feel, what they had never experienced.
To begin to suffer an Evil as long as Eternity.
To quit a place of Pleasures,
For to enter into a place of Torments.
To descend from a Paradise
Into a bottomless Hell.
To pass from plenty into extreme want.
To fall from a throne of glory
Into an Abyss of Confusion.
O what a dreadful change is this!
O what a sensible misfortune!
O how surprising a novelty!
O what an amazing downfall!
That which causes a desire in the good,
Will cause a fear in the wicked.
A virtuous man desires nothing more,
Than to present himself before God.
What an amazement will it be,
To see himself before an angry God?
Before a Father, whom he has outraged.
Before a King, whom he has slighted.
Before a Friend, whom he has betrayed.
Before a Captain, whom he has deserted.
Before a Judge, whom he has offended.
Before a Savior, whom he has crucified.
There is no sight in the World
That a wicked man would more avoid,
And from which he can less hide himself.
Then shall he see all his Sins,
That will present themselves to accuse him.
He shall see the Devils ready to devour him.
Over his head, a Judge ready to condemn him.
Under his Feet, a Precipice whereinto he is falling.
Before him, his goods that are carrying away from him.
By his side, the Objects which made him sin.
Within him, his Body, which is about to leave him.
O Jesus on the Cross!
How then will the sight of thee
Comfort the good? Frighten the bad?
How will they dare to look upon him,
Whom they have crucified?
All your wounds will fall a bleeding
At the sight of these murderers.
What kind of death will mine be?
Such as has been your life.
Shall I die like the Virtuous?
Yes; if you live like the virtuous.
O I will live in grace,
That I may die in peace.
I will live holily,
That I may die in tranquillity.
I will live in Penance,
That I may die in Assurance.
The death of sinners is very ill. Psalm. 33.

Evils will surprise the unjust man at his death. Psalm. 139.

Why should I fear in the evil day: the iniquity of my heel will encompass me.
Psalm. 48.

They shall leave their riches to strangers, their graves shall be their houses
for ever. Psalm. 48.

The rich man died, and was buried in Hell. Luke 16.

Unless you do penance, ye will all perish in like manner. Luke 13.

XI. MED. Of the last Judgment.
THere is an eye that sees all.
An ear that hears all.
A hand that writes all.
I do not see, and yet am seen.
I hear not, and yet am heard.
I know not, and yet am known.
The eye which discovers all, is covered.
The ear which hears all, is hid.
The hand that writes all, is invisible.
Nothing is lost: nothing flies out.
All things pass from Time to Eternity.
That which is past, will return again.
What you thought was lost will be retrieved.
A crime that is buried will rise up again.
That which passes the time away,
Will not pass away with time.
All shall be examined without exception.
Judged without acception.
Condemned without remission.
Punished without conpassion.
Alas my God!
Where shall I hide my self when I am cited?
What shall I answer when you question me?
What will become of me when I am judged?
What would I have don when I am condemned?
Come unto me O ye blessed of my Father!
O amiable words!
Begone from me O ye accursed!
O terrible words!
We write in this life the Sentence
Which will be then pronounced.
Woe unto me, when my crimes shall be discovered!
Woe unto me, when my heart shall be opened!
Woe unto me, when it shall be said,
Here is the man, and the good that I have don him!
Here is the man, and the ill that he has don me!
We shall all stand before the Tribunal of Christ. Romans 14.

We must all be manifested before the Tribunal of Christ, that every one may
receive what belongs to his body, as he has behaved himself, be it good or bad.
1 Cor. 15.

Our Lord will bring into Judgment all that is don. Eccles. 11.

In the end of man is the disclosing of his works. Eccles. 11.

If the just man will scarce be saved, where will the wicked man and the sinner
appear? 1 Pet. 4.

XII. MED. Of Hell.
HEll is the Prison of God's Justice,
It Is the Magazin of his Vengeance.
The term of his Wrath. The center of all Evils.
The deep Well of Death. The Devil's Kingdom.
The Country of the Desperate.
A Region of Tears. A place of Torments.
A Land of Malediction.
A Banishment without comfort.
A loss without redress.
A labor without rest. A pain without end.
An evil without remedy.
There man shall be separated from God.
Cursed by God. Hated of God.
God will hate him
Without any possibility of loving him.
His hatred will be, 1. Infinite: 2. Irreconcilable: 3. Universal. 4. Eternal.
In Heaven there will be all that you love.
In Hell all that you hate.
Pleasure will be pure in Heaven.
And Pains pure in Hell.
Nothing will be wanting in Heaven.
All things will be wanting in Hell.
O strange revolution!
The wicked man flies away from God here upon Earth;
And yet he finds him every where.
He seeks after God in Hell,
And shall never find him.
What, do I say, that he will fly from God?
Alas! he will find him every where,
And yet he will never love him.
His presence makes Heaven.
His presence makes Hell.
The greatest pain of a Reprobate
Is in all places to find an angry God.
O Eternity, how long art thou!
O Eternity, how dreadful art thou!
O Never, that never ends!
O Ever, which lasts ever!
O Present, which stickest close to what is past.
O Past, which stickest to what is to come!
O Eternity, Shall we never apprehend thee!
O Eternity, Shall we never conceive thee!
If we had thee always in our mind,
We should never sin.
A Land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and no order, but an
everlasting horror does dwell. Job 5.

To work always without ever resting.
To rejoice always without ever being sad.
To be always sad without ever rejoicing.
To love God always
Without being in a possibility of hating him.
To hate God always
Without a possibility of loving him.
The one is the portion of the good.
The other the pain of the bad.
O how amiable is Heaven!
O how horrible is Hell!
O what a cheat is the World!
O how blind is man!
O how short is Time! O how long is Eternity!
Nothing is long, of which we see an end.
Nothing is short, of which we see no end.
These shall go into everlasting torments: and the just into life everlasting.
Matthew. 25.

I would they were wise, and did understand, and provide for the last things.

XIV. MED. Of Mortal sin.
WHat have I don?
I have offended an infinite Majesty.
I have injured infinite perfections.
I would have destroyed an infinite goodness.
I have violated an infinite obligation.
I have then committed an infinite injustice.
I therefore deserve an infinite punishment.
God hates Sin with an infinite hatred.
He hates it as much as he loves his Son:
As much as he loves himself.
He hates it entirely: infinitely:
Necessarily: Essentially: Eternally.
And I love, what God hates.
I love it in proportion as much as he hates it.
I love entirely, what he hates entirely.
I love excessively, what he hates infinitely.
I love voluntarily, what he hates necessarily.
I love constantly, what he hates eternally.
O I will henceforth hate Sin
As highly as I am bound to hate it.
I will hate it as much as I am bound to love God.
I will hate it entirely: Infinitely.
Necessarily: constantly: eternally.
The Highest hates sinners, and will render revenge to the wicked. Eccles. 12.

Earth. Genesis 4.

Citizen or a Stranger, shall perish from amongst his people. Numb. 15.

The impious man and his iniquity are hateful. Wisd. 14.

What profit had you in those things, in which you now blush? for indeed their
end is death. Romans 6.

XV. MED. Of Venial Sin.
THat is a great ill that does ill to God.
An injury don to God is a great injury.
Every Venial Sin dishonours God.
It offends the Sanctity of God.
It saddens the Spirit of God.
It cools the love of God.
It diminishes the graces of God.
It makes us stray from the conduct of God.
I dishonor God more by one Venial Sin,
Than I can honor him by my good works.
It Is better to abstain from one Venial Sin,
Than to do all sorts of good works.
Venial Sin wounds and disfigures my Soul.
It darkens my Understanding.
Weakens my Will. Raises my Passions.
By committing of small sins,
I familiarize my self with great ones.
A Habit of Venial Sin
Leads insensibly unto Mortal.
O God of Majesty! How have I slighted thee?
O God of goodness! How have I afflicted thee?
O God of Sanctity! How ill have I treated thee?
My Soul! fear that evil that leads to death.
Apprehend the committing of small sins,
If thou will avoid great ones.
A small matter gains Heaven:
And a small matter loses it.
One Venial sin cannot damn thee.
And yet thy Damnation
Begins many times by a slight sin.
He who is unjust in a small matter, will be unjust in a greater. Luke 16.

See how small a fire burns a great wood? Jam. 3.

He that slights small things, will fall by degrees. Eccl. 19.

Of every idle word that men shall have spoken, they shall give an account in

XVI. MED. Of Penance.
EIther Hell, or Penance.
There are but two ways to Eternity.
The broad one, and the narrow one.
The broad one leads to Hell,
The narrow one to Heaven.
The broad one is the easier,
The narrow one the harder.
The broad one is the more beaten,
The narrow one the less frequented.
In which of the two are you?
You walk in the broad ways,
You live according to custom.
You imitate only the Vices of others:
You imitate not their Virtues.
You hearken to nothing but your own inclinations.
You follow nothing but your passions.
You will not be confined.
You seek nothing but to be at large.
You are resolved to sin:
And you are not resolved to do Penance.
Unless you do it quickly,
You will die suddenly.
Unless you do it now
You will do it in Eternity.
O my God!
Spare me not now,
Provided that you spare me in Eternity.
Do fruits worthy of Penance. Luke 3.

Enter in at the narrow gate. Matthew. 7.

Do ye penance, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand. Matthew. 2.

XVII. MED. That we ought not to differ our Conversion.
UNless you do Penance, you will not be saved.
Unless you do it quickly, possibly you may never do it.
You will not always have this time:
This grace: this will.
He that abuses his time, is deprived of time.
He that abuses grace, is deprived of grace.
He that abuses his liberty, is deprived of liberty.
Why do you differ your Conversion?
Must you be wicked because God is good?
Must you abuse his patience to your insolence?
Must you make his justice a slave to your malice?
To sin in hopes of a pardon,
Is to sin by presumption.
It is to preserve vice,
By the very grace that ought to destroy it.
It Is to nourish sin by the very remedy,
Which ought to be the death of it.
It Is to make of Penance
A fund of Impenitence.
Why will you delay, what must be don one day?
That which will be good to morrow,
Is it not good to day?
Shall you be alive to morrow?
Shall you have this grace to morrow?
Will you ground upon a May-be,
The business of an Eternity?
What may be, will be infallibly,
Unless God hinders it from being.
The Devil will strike his stroke,
Unless God hinder him from acting.
One dies, as he has lived.
Death is the Echo of life.
How shall we hate at our death,
What we have loved all our life long?
A Thief was saved: Despair not.
There was but one: Presume not.
You say, nothing presses you;
And I say all things press you. presses you.
The time that slips away, presses you.
The grace that touches you, presses you.
Heaven that stands open, presses you.
Hell, wherein you are like to fall, presses you.
Death that threatens you, presses you.
Judgment that draws near, presses you.
O my God!
I put off too long,
That which cannot be don too soon.
I continue too long,
That which never ought to be don.
I will no longer expect till to morrow,
Since I am not sure to live to morrow.
My life is all yours,
Why have you but a part thereof?
You give me time for to love you,
Is it just that I should use it to offend you?
If I offer up the Sacrifice of Cain,
I shall be reprobated as he was.
One can never take security sufficient,
When Eternity lies at Stake.
Turn to our Lord, and leave thy sins Eccl. 5.

Do you contemn the riches of God's goodness and patience, etc. Romans 2.

Repent therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out. Act. 3.

Do not delay turning to our Lord, nor differ it from day to day: for his wrath
will come on a sudden. Eccles. 5.

Ruin will fall upon that man, who with a stiff-neck contemns him that rebukes
him. Prove. 29.

XVIII. MED. Of the Conditions of a true Penance.
A True Repentance ought to proceed from
the bottom of the heart.
It Is the heart that conceives sin,
It Is the heart that must destroy it.
It Is the heart that withdraws it self from God,
It Is the heart that must return to God.
Hatred takes its rise out of love.
One hates only, because one loves.
I ought therefore to hate Sin,
As much as I ought to love God:
As much as I ought to love my self:
As much as I ought to love Heaven:
As much as I ought to fear Hell.
I ought to love God singularly:
I ought to hate Sin singularly.
I ought to love all things in order to God.
I ought to hate all things in order to Sin.
I ought to love God above all things.
I ought to hate sin above all things.
I cannot exceed in the love of God.
I cannot exceed in the hatred of sin.
That Repentance is nothing worth,
Unless it be of all crimes.
Unless grace blots them all out,
It blots not so much as one out.
One cannot be reconciled by halfs.
One cannot be both beloved and hated.
One cannot be both in sin and in grace.
One cannot be both God's and the Devil's at once.
One cannot be both worthy of Heaven, and Hell.
Unless one believes all, one believes nothing.
To be a Son of the Church,
One must believe all things.
To be a Son of God, one must hate all sin.
King Saul made exceptions,
And it was the cause of his ruin.
He became God's enemy,
For having saved one of his enemies.
What does it avail you to conquer one sin,
If you be a slave to another?
What good is it to bewail your Cholers,
If you be a slave to your Impurities?
One mortal stroke alone
Is enough to bereave the body of its life.
One mortal sin alone
Is sufficient to deprive the soul of life.
That man is no true Penitent,
Who will be so but for a time.
One must always hate that evil,
Which is always hated by God.
That friendship is not broke off,
Which one designs to make up again.
Can he be said to hate sin,
Who has a mind to commit it again?
Can he be said to have true Contrition,
Who only feels some small Aversion?
One may hate his sin,
Although he feel not the hatred.
One may feel sorrow,
And, yet, not have a true sorrow.
Then does one truly hate sin,
When one is resolved to destroy it.
If you love the causes of sin, you still love sin.
It Is not enough to hate it:
You must repair the damages thereof:
You must restore your ill-gotten goods:
Restore the honor you have taken away:
Repair the Scandals you have given:
Satisfy those whom you have offended.
You must punish by sorrow
The pleasure you have taken in sinning.
God transfers to Penance
The right he has to punish a Sinner.
If Penance spare him, Justice spares him not.
If Penance punish him, Justice punishes him not.
O my God!
How much reason have I to fear
Least I be yet in the state of sin,
Have I hated it Sincerely: Universally:
Constantly: Efficaciously?
Am not I at the end of the year
The same man still that I was at the beginning?
Oh! I will change my life.
My God, change me from my heart.
Give me a new Spirit, that I may lead a new life.
If with all your heart you will return to our Lord, Take away the strange God
from the midst of you. 1 Kings 17.

He that hides his crimes shall not be directed, but he that shall confess
them, and relinquish them shall obtain mercy. Prove. 28.

Turn unto me with all your heart, and rent your hearts, and not your garments:
be converted to God your Lord, because he is gracious, and merciful, patient,
and of much compassion, and ready to be moved upon the malice. Joel 2.

Ananias, why did Satan tempt thy heart to sin to the Holy Ghost, and defraud
of the price of the field? thou did not ly to man, but to God. Act. 5.

Her transgressing Sister has not returned to me with her whole heart: but in
lying. Jer. 3.

Cast away from you all your prevarications, and make to your selves a new
heart, and a new spirit. And why should you die, O house of Israel? Ezech. 8.

XIX. MED. Of the flight from Occasions and evil Companies.
It Is but a folly to hide your self,
The Company you keep betrays you.
Every one is pleased with his like.
Such you are, as those you frequent.
If you suffer bad Company
You may be reckoned to be of an ill life:
Or that you will, at least, soon resemble
The persons whom you frequent.
It Is good example that makes virtuous people;
Bad example that makes bad people.
Ignorance, and Bashfulness
Are the two Bulwarks of Innocence.
One would have been ignorant of many Crimes
Had not one seen them committed.
One would have a horror of sin,
If no body had taught it.
Example ennobles a Crime.
It makes it just and lawful.
It gives it authority.
It makes a necessity of it.
One is ashamed to be Innocent
In the Company of the Nocent.
One does not blush at a sin,
When Example has crowned it.
It Is a vain thing to hope to be good among the wicked.
An evil is easily contracted.
Nature has a propension thereunto.
She imitates what she sees don.
She desires what is forbidden her.
One is not healthy, for being among the healthy;
But one falls sick, by being among the sick.
Go down into Hell.
Look upon those execrable Victims.
Hearken to their lamentable Cries.
Inquire into the cause of their Disaster.
There is never a Reprobate of them all,
Who will not, with many tears, tell you,
That it was Example that undid him.
That it was Company that damned him.
One is willing to please those whom one loves.
And you will never please the wicked,
Unless you be wicked like them.
O! but you do no harm, say you.
You always remain a Sheep,
Although you live among Wolves.
You conserve the sweetness of the waters
In the midst of a brackish Sea.
You draw in an innocent air
In a house infected with the Plague.
And I say, that you are dead,
If you think you are not sick.
Can any one without sin, love the occasion of sin?
Is not the scandal of your Neighbor a very great evil?
Who can believe you to be chaste
With people that are not?
At least you will not long be so.
Example is a bad Master.
You will soon learn to do evil, which you have seen don.
Occasion will draw you to it.
Company will drag you along to it.
The temptation will increase.
Fear will diminish.
Grace will grow weaker.
Shame will be blotted out.
Nature will yield. A habit will be gotten.
The Will will be hardened.
This is the Progress of Iniquity.
This is the Road of Impenitence.
This is the term of Impiety.
O Christian Soul!
Retire out of Occasions. Fly evil Company.
Love not those, whom you ought not to imitate.
Please not those, who displease God.
Withdraw from those, who withdraw from God.
Fly away from contagious persons.
Avoid dangerous occasions.
You have grace enough not to go thither:
You have enough to retire from thence:
But shall you have grace enough, if you stay there?
Is it not a sin of Presumption,
To promise it your self in the occasion?
At least it will be very weak,
And your enemy will be very strong.
He is a Dog in a chain:
When we come near him he bites us.
He expects us in the occasion.
If you go thither, O rash Soul!
You will yield to that temptation.
He that loves danger, will not escape danger.
Be not familiar with a choleric man, neither do thou walk with a furious man,
least thou learn his foot stepped Prove. 22.

He that touches pitch shall be defiled with it, and he that keeps company with
a proud man will put on pride. Eccles. 14.

He that joins himself to Fornicators will be naught. Eccles. 14.

If any one be a Fornicator amongst you, do not so much as eat with such an
one. 1 Cor. 5.

He that loves danger shall perish therein. Eccles. 3.

Go off from the Tabernacles of the wicked men, and do not touch any thing that
belongs to them, that ye be not involved in their ruin. Numb. 16.

If thy right eye scandalize thee pluck it out, and cast it from thee. Matthew. 5.

We denounce unto you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, That you
withdraw your selves from every brother that walks disorderly. 2 Thessalonians. 3.

XX. MED. Of a good, and a bad Conscience.
O How good it is to serve God?
What a pleasure is there in loving him?
How good is he to those that love him?
How terrible to those that offend him?
How happy is a good conscience?
How unhappy is a bad Conscience?
How joyful is a sound heart?
How sad is a sick heart?
O what quiet is there in a good Soul!
O what disturbance in a wicked Soul!
The Conscience of a just man is a Heaven.
The Conscience of a Sinner is a Hell.
God is in the Soul of a just man.
The Devil is in the Soul of a Sinner.
A virtuous man fears nothing.
A wicked man apprehends all things.
A just man is well with himself.
A wicked man is ill with himself.
A virtuous man willingly stays at home,
Because all is in peace there.
A wicked man dares not enter into himself,
Because all things are there in disorder.
O how sweet is Virtue! O how bitter is Vice!
O how precious is the death of the Just!
O how horrible is the death of Sinners!
Ah! I will love God now,
That I may love him in Eternity.
I will lead a good life, that I may have a good death.
My sin is always before me. Psalm. 50.

There is no peace to the wicked, says our Lord. Isa. 48.

A good conscience is, as it were, a perpetual feast. Prove. 15.

Tribulation and anguish upon every Soul that works evil. Romans 2.

Hell is my house. Job. 17.

This is our glory, the testimony of our conscience. 2 Cor. 1.

XXI. MED. Of the peace of the Soul.
I Would fain be in peace.
Whence comes it that I am not?
Is it not because I defer too much to my own sense?
Because I am too much wedded to my own will?
Because I rebel against my Superiors?
Because I will suffer nothing?
Because I desire something with eagerness?
Because I am ambitious? Because I am envious?
Is it not because I wage war against God?
Because I resist his Will?
Because I oppose my self to his Providence?
Because I would have what he will not?
Because I will not, what he wills?
Who can live in peace, that fights against God?
Who can be contented, that is at odds with God?
O my Soul!
If thou art against God; God will be against thee.
If thou disturbest his peace, he will disturb thy quiet.
If thou keep his orders; his orders will keep thee.
If thou disturb his order: His order will disturb thee.
Desire nothing, and thou shall have all.
Do the Will of God, and God will do thine.
He will do the Will of those that fear him. Ps. 144.

Whence come the wars and brangles amongst you, is it not from your
concupiscences? James 4.

Glory be to God on high, and on Earth peace to men of good will. Luke 2.

My peace I give you: let not your heart be troubled. John 14.

Much peace there is to those that love thy law. Ps. 118.

XXII. MED. Of vain Desires.
ARt thou contented, O my Soul?
What do thou desire upon earth?
Is not God sufficient for thee?
Is not he thy happiness?
When were thou well without him?
Or when ill with him?
What do thou seek besides God?
Who can content thee but God?
Thy desires are thy Tyrants.
It Is they make thee miserable.
It Is they that rent thy heart.
How happy would thou be, if thou desiredst nothing?
What do thou get by desiring?
These sort of desires enter not into Heaven.
They are the Devils in Hell.
It Is they that torment the damned.
Leave off desiring, and thou will get out of Hell.
O my God!
Out of you, all abundance is to me indigence.
All sweetness is bitterness to me.
That Heart is very covetous,
To which God is not sufficient.
Covetousness is the root of all evils. 1 Timothy 6.

The desires of sinners shall perish. Ps. 122.

Desires kill the slothful man Prove. 21.

Turn away from me all desires. Eccles. 23.

Yield me not, O Lord, from my desire to the Sinner. Psalm. 139.

Martha, Martha, thou art Sollicitous, and troubled about many things. Luke 10.

XXIII. MED. Of Tepidity.
How miserable is a Tepid Soul?
She has lost all relish of God.
She is deprived of all comforts.
She wanders out of the ways of his Providence.
She sins without fear.
She does ill without remorse.
She dares not enter into her self.
She is Sick, and is not sensible of her Sickness.
She is wicked, and thinks her self good.
She is a slave, and thinks her self free.
She abuses all remedies.
She rejects all Inspirations.
She is insensible to all Grace.
She discredits Devotion.
She scandalizes her Neighbor.
She is a burden to Communities.
She lies heavy upon God's heart.
She is just upon the point of being cast out.
She is in danger of never re-entring more.
Am not I in that state?
Am I hot, or am I cold?
Am I all God's? Or am I his only by halfs?
If so: I have a tepid Soul.
O divine Savior!
How long have I afflicted you?
How long have I clogged your heart?
Ah! Vomit me not up yet.
Deprive me not of your love.
Drive me, if you will, out of your Heaven:
But drive me not out of your Heart.
Draw in your goods from my soul,
But draw not back your love from thence.
Alas! I more dread your hatred,
Than I do the pains of Hell.
My Soul!
Remember the state thou art fallen from.
Resume thy first fervor.
(...) tho I do it quickly,
Thy Candlestick will be removed,
And another put in its place.
JESUS will drive thee out of his heart,
And thou shall never more re-enter therein.
If thou were either cold or hot. Apoc. 3.

Pervent in Spirit. Romans 12.

Remember from whence thou art fallen, and do penance, and do thy first works.
Apoc. 2.

Because thou art tepid, I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth. Apoc. 3.

XXIV. MED. Of the hatred of the World.
THe World is a cheat: It must be contemned.
It never performs what it promises.
Its goods are not true ones.
They are not solid: not pure: not lasting.
They cannot fill the heart: nor content the mind.
They give many disquiets: and never give any rest.
Have you ever had any, whilst you were in its service?
We ought to hate the World.
It Is an enemy to JESUS Christ.
It Is the Devil's Confederate.
He that loves the World, believes the Maxims of the World,
And not those of the Gospel:
He is therefore a Christian only in name,
But an Infidel in heart.
The Devils believe there is a God:
This belief makes them tremble:
But they believe not in God,
Because they do not do his Will.
The Worlding believes there is a God,
But he does not believe in God.
Satan believes and trembles:
The Worlding believes and mocks:
He is then worse than the Devil.
Who ever is a friend to the World
Declares himself an enemy to God.
Is it to be loyal to your King, to love his Enemies?
We ought to fly the World:
Its company is dangerous.
We cannot live in it with security.
It Is a Sea full of shelfs.
The World is 1. Judged: 2. Condemned: 3. Accursed. 4. Excommunicated:
And can we, after all that, frequent it?
It Is better to be hated by the wicked,
Than be beloved by them.
If you are of the World, you will die in your Sin.
Why will you love the World?
Was it the World that created you?
That redeemed you? That will save you?
JESUS says, That he is not of this World:
And you say, That you are of this World:
You are not then a Disciple of JESUS Christ.
Have not you renounced the World
When you were baptized?
You renounced it before the use of reason,
And you adore it having the use of reason.
You renounced it without your liberty,
And you love it with your liberty.
Doubtless, had you had the use of reason,
You would not have been baptized.
O JESUS!
How many adorers has the World,
And how few servants have you?
The World cheats all men: And yet all men serve it.
You cheat no body: And yet no body obeys you.
O! I am a Christian.
I have learnt to contemn the World, and not to adore it.
I had rather be little with humble JESUS,
Than great with the ambitious World.
I had rather weep with afflicted JESUS,
Than divert my self with the voluptuous World.
Want all, with poor JESUS,
Than possess all with the vicious World.
VVo unto the world from scandals. Matthew. 18.

I am not of this world. John 8.

Now is the judgment of this world. John 12.

I pray not for the world. John 17.

Have confidence, I have conquered the world. John 10.

He that loves the world, the charity of the Father is not in him. 1 John 2.

XXV. MED. Of the small number of the Saved.
THe Flood overflowed the whole Earth.
There were but eight men saved.
Of six hundred thousand fighting men,
There were only two that past the Jordan.
Of a field sown with Wheat,
Only the fourth part is fruitful.
Of many that run a Race, only one gets the Prize.
The way to Hell is broad:
The greatest part of men take that way.
The way to Heaven is narrow,
And few there are that find it.
God will have all men to be saved.
He never forsakes them, unless he be first forsaken.
He refuses his grace to no body,
Whence comes it then that so few are saved?
It Is because Nature is corrupted.
Because it always tends downward.
Because we use no violence to it.
Because we are tied to the pleasure of our senses.
Because we follow the Maxims of the World.
Because we do no Penance.
Because we do not what we ought.
Because we begin to do it too late.
Because we stay to the very last,
When we are no more able to sin.
God contemns them at their death,
Who contemned him during their life.
The Devil keeps those fast at their death,
Whom he possessed during their life.
Seldom can one in his old age shake off
The wicked customs of his youth.
Every one carries to his Grave
The Vices of his first years.
They hide themselves in his bones,
And sleep under his ashes with him.
O my God!
Shall I be saved? Shall I be damned?
If I am saved, 'twill be by your grace.
If I am damned, 'twill be through my own fault.
For there is nothing wanting to me for my Salvation.
What would I wish to have done at my death?
What sorrow shall I have in Hell?
Is a short time too long to prepare ones self Eternity?
Enter in at the narrow gate. Math. 7.

Many are called, but few chosen.

Thy perdition is from thy self, O Israel, in me alone is thy help. Hosea 13.

What more could I do to my Vineyard, and have not don it? Isa. 5.

His bones shall be filled with the sins of his youth, and sleep with him in
the dust. Job 20.

XXVI. MED. Of Scandal, or bad Example.
BAd Example is a bad Master.
It teaches evil to those that are ignorant of it.
It persuades those to it that abhor it.
It facilitates it to those that apprehend it.
It commands it to those that hate it.
It makes it honorable to the great ones.
It makes it necessary to the lesser sort.
It makes it lawful to the good,
It makes it pleasing to the wicked.
A scandalous person does more harm,
Than a great Saint can do good.
Example damns more people,
Than all the Preachers have ever saved.
Ignorance is one part of Innocence.
Evil would scarce ever be don,
Had it not been seen don.
One is ashamed to be good,
When one is amongst the wicked.
Only those Beings that are perfect,
Can produce perfect Beings like themselves.
One must be completely wicked,
To make others wicked.
A scandalous man is an Antichrist.
He is a Master of Iniquity.
He is a corrupter of Innocence.
He is the Devil's Substitute.
He is the Minister of his will.
A scandalous person ruins the Empire of JESUS.
He extends the Empire of Lucifer.
He fights under his Standard.
He draws men to his side.
He Martyrizes Innocence.
He damns the Souls of his brothers.
He commits as many sins,
As he is the cause of being committed.
He shall be damned as many times,
As he has damned people.
He shall have as many Hells,
As he has sent Souls to Hell.
O Scandalous Soul!
What has JESUS don to thee,
That thou should persecute him?
What has thy Neighbor don,
That thou should damn him?
Have thou reason to be wicked, because he is good?
And to wish him ill, because he is innocent?
Have not thou committed sins enough,
Wthout loading thy self with the sins of others?
What rest will thou have in Hell,
Where thou will have for tormentors,
All those that thou have damned?
O my God!
Forgive me my own proper sins,
And impute not to me the sins of others.
I have hitherto been a Tyrant,
I will henceforth be a Martyr.
I have lived like a Devil,
I will now live like an Angel.
I have labored only to destroy Souls,
I will now labor to save them.
I shall not be in security,
Unless I save as many as I have damned.
I am not born for my self alone,
I must likewise answer for my Neighbor.
My life is only necessary for my self,
But my reputation is necessary for others.
I ow Chastity to my self,
But I ow Modesty to the whole World.
Woe unto the world from scandals. Matthew. 17.

He that scandalizes one of these little ones, it were better for him to have a
Millstone hung about his neck, and to be flung into the Sea. Matthew. 17.

If thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off. Mark. 4.

VVo unto him by whom scandal comes. Luke 7.

XXVII. MED. Of outward Penance and Mortification.
THere is nothing more united than Soul and Body.
Nothing less united than Soul and Body.
When the one goes forward, the other goes backward.
When one goes up, the other goes down.
When the one is well, the other is sick.
When the one is strong, the other is weak.
I am not a man, if I obey my Passions.
I am no Christian, unless I fight against my Passions.
I am no Penitent, unless I mortify my Passions.
How do I know whether my sins be forgiven me?
Whether the punishment be remitted me?
Whether God will chastise me spiritually,
Or punish me corporally?
If I spare my self, God will not spare me.
If I punish my self, God will not punish me.
If I hate my self, God will love me.
If I love my self, God will hate me.
O! I will chastise my Body,
That I may be predestined.
I will fight against this enemy of God,
That I may be crowned.
I will mortify my senses,
That I may live a life of the spirit.
I will be crucified with JESUS,
That I may rise again with JESUS.
I abhor my body, unless it have wounds as his had,
Since I have not the heart to make my self any,
I will suffer those that God shall make me.
O Christian Soul!
Make of thy body a living and dying victim.
Mortify thy Passions, thy Senses, and thy Desires.
Mortify thy self at all times:
In all places: In all things.
Mortify thy self discreetly and prudently.
Give thy flesh unto God, and he will give thee his spirit.
Do thou take care of the exterior,
And he will take care of the interior.
Do thou do what is easy, and he will do that which is hard,
Walk as long as thou art able,
And he will carry thee when thou can go no longer.
The flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. Gal. 5.

Those who are in the flesh, cannot please God. Romans 8.

Those that belong to Christ, have crucified their flesh with its vices and
lusts. Gal. 5.

If you live according to the flesh, you shall die. Romans 8.

XXVIII. MED. Of the excellency of Mortification.
WHat is Mortification?
It Is a death of love, which kills the criminal life.
Which takes the Soul off from the senses.
Which severs her from the body.
Which makes her live in spirit.
What is Mortification?
It Is a Martyrdom of love, without Crime, or Tyrant.
Less bloody than that of faith, but longer and more tedious.
More free, and more voluntary:
More honorable, and more innocent.
More troublesome, and more constant.
What is Mortification?
It Is a continuation of the Sacrifice of JESUS:
Which fills up what is wanting to his Passion:
Which makes our Bodies Members of his.
Which enlivens us with his Spirit:
Gives us a share of his Sorrows:
Which merits for us a treasure of his Grace:
Which disposes us to the throne of his Glory.
O let me die the death of the Just,
That I may live the life of the Just.
O let me be a victim to love,
That I may die a death of love.
I beseech you brethren, through the mercy of God, that you yield your bodies a
living and holy Host, and pleasing to God. Romans 12.

I die every day. 1 Cor. 15.

I am fastened to the Cross. Gal. 2.

I fulfill the things that are wanting to the Sufferances of Christ, in my
flesh, for his body, which is the Church. Col. 1.

If by the spirit you mortify the works of the flesh, you shall live. Romans 8.

XXIX. MED. Of the Profit and necessity of Temptations.
THe evil purifies the good.
A Storm makes Trees take deeper Roots.
Wind blows away the Chaff.
Fire refines Gold.
Snow warms the Ground.
A Combat tries ones strength.
Infirmity conserves Humility.
Temptation increases Charity.
Every thing has its contrary.
War produces Peace.
Every thing subsists by opposition.
You will be saved, but by Temptation.
Unless you be tempted, you will not be predestined.
Unless you fight, you will not be crowned.
Unless you be assaulted, you are already overcome.
This Combat is troublesome; but it is necessary.
It gives an exercise to your virtue,
But it gets you a Crown.
That which encourages you to resist,
Will crown your patience.
The feeling of Temptation hurts not,
Provided the heart consent not.
God is with you; what do you fear?
You are stronger than your enemy.
He cannot overcome you, unless you will.
He cannot bite you, unless you go near him.
Be vigilant in the first beginnings.
Pray to God at all times.
Fly occasions.
Be firm in your resolutions.
Take counsel in your Doubts.
Seek for succor in your Combats.
Go up to Heaven, there to see your Throne.
Go down into Hell, there to see your place.
It Is on this Combat, peradventure,
That your Salvation depends.
It Is on this Moment, that your Eternity depends.
It Is on this Crisis, that your life depends.
It Is on this Temptation, that depends your Predestination.
O JESUS, my King!
I fight for you, and before you.
You are the Spectator of my labors.
You are the Witness of my feebleness.
Suffer me not to betray you.
Permit me not to ruin my self.
Arise, O God of Hosts, make have unto my succor.
Defend me against my foes.
Scatter away those that hate me.
He that is not tempted, what does he know? Eccles. 34.

Gold and Silver is tried in the fire, and men that are acceptable in the
furnace of humiliation. Eccles. 12.

Esteem it all joy, brethren, when you fall into several temptations. Jac. 1.

Vexed in few things, in many things they shall be well disposed. Wisd. 3.

XXX. MED. Of the causes of our Temptations.
WHy am I tempted?
It Is because you are proud.
Or, because you watch not over your Senses.
Or, because you avoid not Occasions.
Or, because you have ill Habits.
Or, because you are not in order.
Or, for that you have quitted your Vocation.
Or, because you are not sufficiently employed.
It Is because you are a man.
Because you are a Sinner.
And because you are a Christian,
And have a mind to be happy.
Why does the Devil tempt you?
It Is because he hates the Image of God.
Because he envies man.
Because he would make you his Slave.
Because he would have Companions.
Because he would enter into your heart.
Because he would ascend God's Throne.
Because he would profane his Temple.
Because he would be adored therein.
Because he would Crucify JESUS Christ,
And renew all his Ignominies.
Will you carry on his Designs?
Will you content his Passion?
It Is what you do, as often as you consent to Temptation.
Why does God permit you to be tempted?
It Is for his glory, and your good.
He would know whether you love him.
He would make you know your self.
He has a mind to try your virtue.
To keep you in a dependence on him.
To fit you for a Combat.
To thrust on your Sloth.
To take you off from Creatures.
To oblige you to have recourse to him.
To make you merit Heaven.
O my Savior!
I wonder not that I am tempted,
Since you were also tempted.
It Is good that I should know you.
It Is good that I should know my self.
I find that Temptation hinders me from entering into Presumption.
Tempt me, O God, try me.
See, whether there be no iniquity in me.
O no! tempt me not.
Alas! I know my own weakness.
Deliver me rather from my temptation;
At least fortify me against my temptation.
Satan strikes at you, as well as me.
Defend your self in me, and through me.
God tempted Abraham. Genesis 20.

Fear not, for God came for to try you. Exodus 20.

The Lord your God tempts you, to make it publicly known, whether you love him
or not. Genesis 13.

Anania, why did Satan tempt thy heart? Act. 5.

Every one is tempted by being drawn and allured by his own concupiscence. Jam.
1.

God tempted them, and found them worthy of him. Wisd. 3.

XXXI. MED. Of the troubles and pains of Mind.
HOw these thoughts torment me?
Why art thou tormented at them?
I fear I shall give consent to them.
If you fear, you do not consent.
Your fear ought to secure you.
I am fallen into sin:
You must rise quickly out of it.
God is angry with me.
It Is in your power to appease him.
Walk with more Diligence.
Labor with more Fidelity.
Confess your self without delay.
Humble your self without disturbance.
One evil does not repair another.
Sin is not cured by Sin.
This Temptation is importune.
Yes. But it is necessary for you.
It keeps you in humility.
It maintains you in your dependence.
It obliges you to pray.
It hinders you from presuming.
Without Temptation one cannot be tried.
Without fighting one cannot be crowned.
Without a Cross none can be saved.
O my God! Keep me close to you,
And I will not fear the Devils,
Although they were all against me.
Without you, I am nothing but weakness.
With you, I am all fortitude.
If I have wherewithal to ruin my self,
You have wherewithal to save me.
Let not your heart be troubled. John 14.

Because thou were acceptable to God, it was necessary that Temptation should
try thee. Tob. 12.

God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are
able: but he will make profit of your temptation, that you may be able to
sustain it. 1 Cor. 10.

Blessed is the man, who suffers Temptation. Jam. 1.

XXXII. MED. Of natural Inclinations.
TO love by Inclination, is to love like a Beast.
To love with Inclination, is to love like a Man.
To love without Inclination, is to love like a Christian.
To love against Inclination, is to love like a Saint.
Christian Charity embraces all the World.
Its motive is singular and universal.
If for God, I love him that pleases me,
I ought also to love him that displeases me.
They are both of them created by God:
Both made to his Image:
Both redeemed with his Blood:
Both called to his Glory.
I am not bound to love all the World equally.
But I am bound to hate no body.
Particular Friendships, are Universal Hatreds.
The Unions of Inclination,
Are Schisms and Heresies of Heart.
The nearer you draw to one person,
The farther you remove from all others.
If you are totally one person's,
You are nothing to all the rest.
You commit an injustice.
You refuse them what you ow them.
You wound Charity.
You divide Unity.
You slight Regularity.
You scandalize the Community.
You fly from Solitude.
You dare not remain any more before God.
You commit a great many sins.
Your Spirit is without Recollection.
Your Heart without Devotion.
Your Prayers without Gust.
Your Communions without Fruit.
Your Life without Peace.
Your Labors without merit.
O my God!
How amazed shall I be at my death,
When I shall see that I have not loved you?
Unless I love all my Brothers,
I love not so much as one for your sake.
If I have an Aversion for one,
I have no Charity for all the rest.
O how much time ill spent!
O how many dangerous Familiarites!
O how many unprofitable Discourses!
O how many criminal Entertainments!
O my God!
I will for your sake love all sorts of persons.
I will love my Friends and my Foes.
The Rich and the Poor.
The Great and the Little.
The good humors, and the bad humors.
Those that do me good, and those that do me hurt.
Since they are all your Subjects:
All your Children: All your Members:
Since you love them all:
That you are in them all:
That you order me to love them all.
There is no acception of persons with God. Romans 2.

He makes his Sun to rise upon the good, and the bad, and rains upon the just,
and unjust. Matthew. 5.

Thou shall not make acception of persons Deuteronomy. 16.

Is there not one Father of us all? Is there not one God who created us? why
then does every one contemn his Brother? Mal. 2.

These are those that separate themselves: Animals that have not the Spirit.
Jude. v. 19.

XXXIII. MED. Of Aversions.
THe wounds of the heart are mortal.
Hatred makes Charity die.
The fairest of all Victories,
Is to triumph over our Aversions.
To love a Friend is the virtue of a Pagan.
To love a Foe is the virtue of a Christian.
It Is the strongest of all loves,
Because it triumphs over the greatest enemy.
It Is the amplest of all loves,
Because it embraces both friend and foe.
It Is the purest of all loves,
Because Nature cannot love an enemy.
It Is the most meritorious of all loves,
Because there is nothing harder than to love an enemy.
God loves all things that he made.
He has an Aversion to nothing but sin.
The Creatures that fight with each other,
Are at peace in his bosom.
He has no Antipathy, because his Essence is infinite.
Great Souls have no enmities.
They have a dominion over all Objects.
They are not divided by matter.
All things are at peace in their heart.
Sin only alone is not there in quiet,
Because it makes war against Sanctity.
Self-love is divided within it self.
Divine love admits of no division.
Inclination has its bounds:
Charity has none.
To love all things, except sin,
Is to love out of Charity.
It Is to be like God.
It Is to have a heart as great as God's.
O how happy should I be,
Had I an assurance that I loved God truly?
I can have no greater assurance thereof,
Than to love my enemies for God.
If I am pleased with those that displease me:
If I oblige those who disoblige me:
If I love those that hate me:
If I testify an affection to those,
For whom I feel an Aversion,
I have all the assurance that one can have,
That I love God sincerely:
That all my sins are forgiven me,
Because I love my enemies for his sake.
O God my Lord!
I will testify my love toward you,
By loving for your sake those, who are not love-worthy.
By doing good to those, who do ill to me.
By conversing with those, that displease me.
By seeking after those, that I cannot look upon without pain.
By that, it is that you will know
That I am your Child:
That I am your Disciple:
That I live not by humor,
And that I love you with all my heart.
If you love those that love you, what reward will you have? do not the
Publicans do the fame? Matthew. 5.

If you salute your Brethren only, what do you do more? do not the Heathens do
the fame? ibid.

Amen, I say to you, as long as you have not don to one of these little ones,
neither have you don to me. Matthew. 25.

Their heart is divided, now they will perish. Os. 10.

XXXIV. MED. Of Presumption.
WHat art thou, that thou presumest of thy self?
What were thou heretofore?
What art thou at present?
What will thou be one day?
Thou know that thou have sinned,
But thou know not whether thy sin be forgiven.
Thou know that thou have offended God,
But thou know not whether thou have appeased him.
Thou know that thou have lost grace,
But thou know not whether thou have recovered it again.
Thou say, Thou have been at Confession;
But was thy Confession good?
Was it entire?
Was it accompanied with sorrow?
Was this sorrow supernatural?
Was it sincere?
Was it of all thy sins?
Was it with all thy heart?
Was it of all thy life?
Have thou been seen to change thy manners?
Is that sorrow true and real,
Which dies as soon as it is conceived?
Thou feel not thy self guilty of any sin;
But that does not justify thee.
One ought not to be disquieted for what is past.
Neither ought one to presume of what is to come.
What art thou at present?
Art thou in the grace of God?
Have thou nothing upon thy Conscience?
The Heart of man is very hidden.
The Devil's wit is very crafty.
Vices imitate Virtues.
Passions disturb our knowledge.
One is easily persuaded, that what one loves is innocent.
No man is an enemy to himself.
We defend all that we love.
Many times we make a Mortal sin pass for a Venial one.
We reckon but as a slight Detraction,
Calumnies of the highest importance.
Whatsoever good thou do, secures thee not that thou art good.
In whatsoever state thou art,
Thou know not whether thou art in a good one:
For to do a good action, thou must have a good intention.
Who knows when it is good?
Many go down into Egypt,
That think they go up to Jerusalem.
Many are in Illusion, who believe they are in Contemplation.
How deceitful is the heart of man?
Only God alone can understand it.
Thou must not therefore flatter thy self.
Thou must not over-perswade thy self.
What will thou be for the time to come?
Art thou sure that thou shall persever?
Will thou answer for thy own Will?
How often has she deceived thee?
Will thou answer for God's Will?
He efficaciously would have thee be saved;
But thou must cooperate thereunto.
Does he owe thee all sorts of graces?
Is he bound to privilege a presumptuous man?
Little sins lead us unto great ones.
Our Salvation often depends upon a small matter.
Whilst we are here on Earth, we may ascend to Heaven.
Till we are in Heaven, we may fall down into Hell.
I find no assurance, but in Humility and in Obedience.
The fall of great ones, shall make me little.
The ruin of the Proud, shall make me humble.
O my God, my hope!
Give me not over to the Spirit of Pride.
Take all things from me: I care not,
Provided you leave me humility.
Draw back your Talents: I ask them not,
Provided that I have Charity.
If I look on my self, I find all things to be feared.
If I consider you, I find all things to be hoped.
Alas! I deceive my self, but you cannot deceive me.
I oftentimes wish harm to my self,
But you always wish me well.
My Salvation is more in assurance
In your hands than in my own.
I will always diffide in my self,
But will always conside in you.
He that lives without diffidence
Deceives himself, if he be in assurance.
Man knows not whether he be worthy of love or hatred. Eccles. 4.

The heart of man is wicked and unsearchable, who shall know it. Jer. 17.

I am not conscious to my self of any thing, but I am not thereby justified. 1
Cor. 14.

Thou stand by faith: be not high-minded, but fear. Romans 4.

Be ye therefore humble under the mighty hand of God. 1 Pet. 5.

XXXV. MED. Of the good use of Time.
TIme is precious: short: irreparable.
Precious: because each moment of it is worth an Eternity.
Short: because it lasts only our life.
Irreparable: because it never returns.
What will it avail you to have lived in pleasures,
If you die in sin?
What will it avail you to have past your time well,
If it go ill with you for all Eternity?
Time is given you to think on your Salvation:
You have but little of it remaining.
Death draws on.
Eternity advances.
Your life slips away.
Your health impairs.
Your Judgment is preparing.
Poor fool! this very night thy soul shall be fetched away.
And to whom will thou leave all that thou have hoarded up?
To whom will he be good, who is naught to himself?
After your death, you will wish for one moment
Of that time, which you squander away in Pastimes.
After death you will repine at the loss of that time,
Which you spend unprofitably.
Make therefore good use of your time.
Manage those precious moments.
Redeem that which you have lost.
Employ the present well.
Regulate well that which remains.
Think on your Salvation.
Save your Soul.
An Angel has sworn by him that lives in all Ages,
That soon there will be no more time.
O my God!
Give me yet a little more time,
And I will give you all satisfaction.
Alas! I deserve indeed to be deprived of it,
Because I have so long abused it.
But I will henceforth make better use of it.
I will think on nothing but my Salvation.
I will repair the time I have lost,
And employ well the time remaining.
They were taken away before their time. Job 22.

Do not much wickedness, and be not a fool, that thou may not die in a time
not thine. Eccles. 7.

Time is short. 1 Cor. 7.

Redeeming time. Ephesians. 5.

He swore by him that lives for ever and ever, That Time shall be no more.
Apoc. 10.

Wherefore, whilst we have time, let us do good. Gal. 6.

XXXVI. MED. Of Persecutions.
DO the good persecute you?
Examine your self.
Do the wicked torment you? Rejoice.
We cannot please God, and Man.
We cannot be beloved by the good, and the bad.
If I will please men,
I displease JESUS Christ.
If I am hated by the wicked,
I am loved by JESUS Christ.
Their Persecution pushes us on to Heaven.
It loosens us from Creatures.
It maintains us in our duty.
It hinders us from dispersing our selves.
It makes us dwell at home.
It purges us of our Vices.
It implants virtues in us.
It gives us a distaste to this life.
It makes us desire death.
Would you have gone to God, had the World loved you?
Would you have sought after God,
If the World had not rejected you?
It Is God gives the word to his Creatures.
It Is he that forbids them to make much of you.
He that orders them to send you packing.
He that commands them to drive you away.
He arms the World against you,
To force you to return to him.
He sows thorns upon the ground,
To hinder you from resting there.
He cannot will sin, but he wills the effect of sin.
He hates the Persecutors, but loves the Persecuted.
O my God! How admirable is thy wisdom!
How amorous is thy conduct!
If you had not wounded me, I had never been cured.
Unless you had hedged me in with thorns,
I had made my escape from you.
I had not been yours, if the World would have had me.
I had been against you, if the World had not been against me.
O how am I indebted to its hatred?
O what obligation I have to your love?
O how mercifully severe have you been to me?
O how kindly have you persecuted me?
Fill their face with shame, and they will seek thy name, O Lord. Ps. 82.

Lord, in their anguish they sought after thee. Isa. 26.

I will hedge thy Vineyard with thorns. Hos. 26.

You shall be hated by all men for my sake. Matthew. 24.

Blessed are those, who suffer persecution for justice. Matthew. 5.

XXXVII. MED. That it is necessary to be afflicted and persecuted.
THere is no Salvation without a Cross.
No Merit without Patience.
No Victory without Combat.
No Virtue without Exercise.
Standing water corrupts.
Flesh without Salt putrefies.
Iron that is not used rusts.
A Horse is slow without a Spur.
How miserable are you, if you have no misery?
How will you be a Martyr, if you have no Tyrant?
How will you be a Christian, unless you be persecuted?
How will you be saved, unless you be afflicted?
JESUS was hated by the wicked,
And you would be loved by them.
JESUS was persecuted, and you would be made much off.
JESUS was contemned by the World,
And you would be honored by it.
You must be either a Martyr, or a Tyrant:
Either a Persecutor, or persecuted.
O JESUS!
Be with me, and let all the World be against me.
I had rather have the hatred of the wicked,
Than their friendship:
Their Persecutions, rather than their kindness.
I will not please those that displease you.
I am overjoyed that I displease those,
Whom you cannot please.
Since I suffer Persecution,
I have the tokens of Predestination.
Since I have Tyrants,
I shall be one of the number of the Martyrs.
Since I am persecuted by the wicked,
I begin to be in the number of the good.
Through many tribulations we must enter into the Kingdom of God. Act. 14.

If you suffer any thing for justice, you are happy. 1 Pet. 3.

Communicating with the sufferances of Christ, rejoice, that we may rejoice in
the revelation of his glory. 1 Pet. 4.

All that will live piously in Christ JESUS, shall suffer persecution. 2 Timothy 3.

XXXVIII. MED. Of Human Respect.
TO displease God, for fear of displeasing men.
To omit any good, for fear of the wicked.
To believe in JESUS Christ, and blush at his Gospel.
To dissemble our faith, when we are bound to make profession of it,
Is to be an Apostate, and an Infidel.
It Is to be a Christian in name, and an Infidel in action.
There are Apostates of heart.
There are Apostates of mouth.
There are Apostates in actions.
You are not so in your heart,
But you are by your mouth.
You are not so in words, but you are so by your actions;
And that is enough for your damnation.
It Is not sufficient for to be saved,
To have faith in your heart;
You must have it also in your mouth.
It Is not enough to confess it by words,
But you must profess it by your actions.
To dissemble your faith upon occasions,
Is to renounce your Religion.
If you confess JESUS before men,
He will confess you before his Father.
If you renounce him before men,
He will renounce you before his Father.
If you blush to be his Disciple,
He will blush to be your Master.
If you own him to be your Lord,
He will own you to be his Servant.
O JESUS my Lord!
I have been a long time a Christian in name,
And a Pagan in action.
I have the faith of a Christian, but the life of a Heathen.
I renounce my Religion for fear of a What will people say?
I apprehend more the Jeers of the wicked,
Than Martyrs did the cruelty of Tyrants.
Alas! You confessed me before your Father,
And I renounce you before men.
You are not ashamed of me in Heaven,
And I am ashamed of you on Earth.
O I hate my cowardice! I detest my dissimulation!
I will show that I am a Christian,
And profess my Religion.
He that is afraid of man, will soon fall. Prove. 9.

I say to you, my friends, be not frightened by those who kill the body, and
after can do no more. Luke 12.

Every one that shall confess me before men: the Son of man will confess him
before the Angels of God. Luke 12.

He that shall be ashamed of me and my words: him will the Son of man be
ashamed of, when he comes in his Majesty, and that of his Father, and the holy
Angels. Luke 9. v. 26.

XXXIX. MED. Of Slander or Detraction.
A Word is soon said, but not so soon amended.
It passes lightly, but wounds cruelly.
It pierces the heart of God, who forbids Detraction.
It pierces the heart of your neighbor, who suffers the Detraction.
It pierces the heart of your friend, who gives ear to the Detraction.
It pierces the heart of him, who is the Author of the Detraction.
It is an envenomed Viper, that poisons all hearts.
It Is a sharp Sword, which divides the members of JESUS Christ.
It Is a cruel Lance, which transpierces his heart.
It Is a Robbery of the greatest of goods.
It Is a murder of the noblest of lives.
It Is a wound of the Soul.
It Is an evil without remedy.
There is no pardon to be hoped for,
Unless restitution be made.
The sin is not forgiven,
Unless what is stolen be restored.
Honor is not to be repaired,
When once it is taken away.
The Wound of Slander is incurable:
The Scar, thereof remains for ever.
O my God!
How many Robberies have I committed,
And how many Murders?
My Tongue is a Pen that writes lightly,
And which has prepared the Decree,
Which will be pronounced at my Judgment.
I shall be justified by my Tongue:
I shall be condemned by my Tongue.
Alas! who then shall be saved?
Who can say, I have never detracted?
I have made reparation
For the harm my Detraction has done?
Fly from Detractions.
Satan is in their mouth when they speak.
In your ear, when you hearken to them.
Bear with a Detraction, but give no occasion for it.
Repair those you have spoken, in the best way you can.
That Truth which is not charitable,
Proceeds from a Charity that is not true.
I persecuted him who did secretly slander his neighbor. Psalm. 100.

Detract not one another brethren: he that detracts his brother, or he that
judges his brother, detracts the law, and judges the law. Jam. 4.

He that detracts any thing, he obliges himself for the future. Prove. 13.

Neither Robbers nor Slanderers, shall possess the Kingdom of Heaven. 1 Cor. 6.

Out of thy words thou shall be justified, and out of thy words thou shall be
condemned. Matthew. 12.

XL. MED. Of Sadness.
WHence comes it that you are sad?
It Is doubtless because your heart is sick.
Because you are a slave to some Passion.
Because you love some Creature.
Because you feed some desire.
Because your Conscience is not clear.
Because you have committed some sin.
Because you would have what you cannot have.
Because you cannot do what you would.
Because you will not do what God would have you do.
Because you would do what God would not have you do.
It Is because you would suffer nothing.
Because you adhere too much to your own sense.
Because you fear the World too much.
Because you seek your own ease too much.
Because you love your self too much.
Happy is that man, who desires nothing but God.
How joyful is that man, who fears nothing but God?
How secure is that man, who has nothing to lose?
How contented is that man, who lives a virtuous life?
Have an esteem for nothing but God,
And nothing will afflict you.
Think all, that you can lose, already lost.
Love not that wealth, which may be taken from you.
Ty your self to nothing that may perish.
Whatsoever you lose, still preserve your peace.
Live always well, and you will never be sad.
Leave your self to God, and you will always be contented.
Drive away sadness far from you. Eccles. 30.

Rejoice in our Lord, and exult, O ye just. Psalm. 31.

Let the just exult in our Lord, praise becomes the upright. Ps. 32.

Rejoice in our Lord always, again, I say, rejoice. Phil. 4.

As it were sad, but always rejoicing. 2 Cor. 6.

XLI. MED. The ill effects of Sadness.
A Man that is sad, dishonours God.
He shows that he believes not his Providence.
He accuses God of ignorance.
He tacitly complains of his injustice.
It Is I, says he, that take this good from you:
It Is I, that permit this persecution:
It Is I, who send you this sickness:
And do you dare to murmur?
Do you dare to complain?
Can one be sad without murmuring?
You blaspheme not with your mouth,
But you blaspheme in your heart.
You say, there is no God:
Or that he knows not how to govern the World.
A man that is sad loses himself.
He wastes himself with Melancholy.
He shortens the life of his Body.
He brings death to his Soul.
His heart is a Hell.
The Devil has a right to dwell in it.
He pushes him on to Despair.
He engages him in all sorts of Vices.
He proposes to him bodily Pleasures,
For want of Spiritual ones.
O strange Disease! which needs such a Remedy.
O JESUS! who never were melancholy,
And yet had always causes of sadness.
Give me not over to this Passion.
Plunge me not into this Hell.
I will always have a contented heart,
Because you dispose of all things for my good.
I. will honor your Providence.
Edify my Neighbor.
Begin my Heaven even in this life,
For to confirm it after my death.
A discontented Servant dishonours his Master.
A true Servant of God ought never to be sad.
He will not be sad, nor turbulent. Isa. 42.

Why is thy countenance sad? 2 Psdr. 2.

As it were sad, but always rejoicing. 2 Cor. 6.

A wicked heart will cause sadness. Eccles. 36.

Be not like Hypocrites, sad. Math. 6.

XLII. MED. Remedies against Sadness.
WHy do you afflict your self?
That which seems ill to you, is not so.
Your Miseries are Mercies.
Your Disgraces are Graces of God.
They take you off from the World.
They unite you to our Lord.
They make you enter into your self.
They give you a disgust of this life.
They make you feel your sin.
They are marks of your Salvation.
They are Pledges of your Predestination.
Did not God love his Son?
Was there ever man more afflicted than he?
Your evil is not to be complained of.
If it be light, it is easily boren.
If it be violent, it cannot last long.
A great ill cannot be long.
Unless it be droven away otherways,
It must sink under it self.
Either it bereaves you of your life,
Or of your feeling of it.
No where, but in Hell, evil is immortal.
Time, without your thinking of it, will do your buliness.
Your pain cannot last any longer than your life.
And what is life in regard of Eternity?
Do you think to live in this World without affliction?
How will you be a member of Jesus Christ?
How can you reign with him,
Unless you be afflicted as he was?
Show me a man without his Cross,
And I will discharge you from yours.
Is it just, that you should have for nothing,
That which has cost all the Saints so dear?
What rank will you take in Heaven?
In what place shall you be put?
All the Saints are laden with wounds,
Shall you be the only one, that has none?
Think on Heaven, and your sadness will away,
The hopes of a great good produces a great joy.
All evil is little, which delivers us from an Eternity of pains.
The body feels but little pain, when the mind dwells in Heaven.
Do not you know that Heaven, is the in heritance of the afflicted?
That it is the Kingdom of the Crucified?
That it is the portion of suffering Souls?
If you have a mind never to be sad,
Drive sin out of your Soul.
It Is that which saddens Hell it self.
If they were without sin,
They would be without sadness.
What joy can that person have,
Who has driven God out of his heart?
What rest can he take, who has poison lying on his heart?
If you fasten your self to nothing,
You will afflict your self for nothing.
We suffer in proportion to our love.
Our Desires are our Tormentors.
We quit not without grief, what we possess with love.
Have you a mind never to be sad?
Place your hopes upon God,
Lay open your pains to him,
Beg comfort of him.
Persever in Prayer.
Submit your self to his orders.
Leave your self to his Providence.
Conform your self to his good pleasure.
And you will soon find what you seek.
Are you desirous not to be sad?
Conduct your self by reason:
Correct your imagination.
Men are not miserable,
But because they imagine themselves so.
A grief is light, when opinion adds nothing to it.
It Is Opinion that creates all our evils.
One would not be unhappy,
Unless he fancied himself to be so.
Regulate your self by Faith,
And not by your Senses.
Consult your reason, not opinion.
You are afraid of an evil that threatens you.
This is to afflict your self without a cause.
To afflict your self before you have cause.
You bewail an evil past.
Your tears will not deliver you from it.
Why do not you make a virtue of necessity?
Why do not you make profit of your losses?
What good does it do you to recall an evil that is no more.
Why will you make your self miserable,
Because you have been so.
It Is a shame for a wise man,
Not to cease to be sad,
But when he is weary of weeping.
It is better to quit that grief,
Than to stay till it quit us.
What is past concerns us no more.
The future concerns us not as yet.
What is present is but a moment.
Why will you prolong your torment?
We must fit our selves to our evils,
When we cannot rid our selves of them.
Sadness increases our losses, but repairs them not.
There is nothing but sin that it destroys.
For sin only, we ought therefore to be sad.
O how happy should we be,
Could we correct our thoughts?
O how joyful should we be,
If we desired nothing here on earth?
O how great a torment is a great desire!
A virtuous man is always contented.
He has always what he would have,
Because he always would have, what he was.
Change does not change him.
Because he rests upon what is immovable.
Anna, why do thou weep? 1 Kings 1.

Why art thou sad, O my Soul, and why do thou trouble me? Ps. 41.

He said to her, Weep not. Luke 7.

My brethren, rejoice in our Lord. Phil. 3.

Let the hearts of those who seek God rejoice. Ps. 140.

Is any among you sad? let him pray. Jam. 5.

XLIII. MED. Of Pride.
AN humbled God is a great mercy.
A proud man is a great misery.
Pride is the head spring of all evils,
As Humility is the Mother of all Virtues.
We are angry, because we are proud.
We are sad: impatient:
We would be rich:
We are envious: unchaste:
Because we are proud.
God humbles the spirit by the body.
He gives up the proud to shameful Passions.
He covers with beasts-skins those who aspired to be Gods.
Pride is the sin of the Devil.
It Is the first that ever was committed.
Heaven was the place of its birth.
Hell will be the place of its punishment.
Other sins fly away from God.
This makes war against God:
And God on his side, makes war against it.
He looks on it as his foe.
He gives his grace to the humble,
But he resists the proud.
He humbles them Corporally: Spiritually:
Temporally: Eternally.
O how great an evil is it to have God for ones Enemy?
My God! I beg one favor of you;
For your glory and my salvation:
That I may know you,
And that I may know my self.
That I may know your greatness,
And my own littleness.
Your benefits, and my ingratitudes:
Your goodness, and my malice.
What I have from you, that I may praise you:
What from my self, for to humble my self.
O precious Nothing, wherein I find all things!
O luminous Nothing, wherein I see all things.
O delicious Nothing, wherein I taste all things.
I am in rest, when I am in Nothing,
Because I am then in my place.
I have no rest, when I am out of Nothing,
Because I am no more in my center.
O God my All!
When shall I be void of all that I am,
That I may be filled with all that thou art.
Every arrogant man is an abomination to our Lord. Prove. 16.

Our Lord swore in his soul: I hate the pride of Jacob. Amos 6.

He that humbles himself shall be exalted, and he that exalts himself shall be
humbled. Luke 14.

Amen, I say to you, unless you be converted and become like little ones, ye
shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Matthew. 18.

God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble. Jam. 4.

XLIV. MED. Of the pardoning of Injuries.
GOd commands you to do it.
And will you not do it?
You would do it for your King,
If he should order you to do it.
Who has right to command, if God has not?
Will you not do what pleases him?
The Servant's satisfaction must yield to his Masters authority.
What God forbids you,
He forbids the whole World.
What God commands you,
He commands the whole World.
As he forbids you to hate your enemy,
So he forbids your enemy to hate you.
As he commands you to love all men,
So he commands all men to love you.
Is there any thing more just than this Command?
God orders you to do it as a King.
He entreats you as a Father.
He teaches it to you as a Master,
By his mildness, and by his patience:
By his word, and by his example.
What, does he not suffer from you?
In one hand he holds revenge,
And in the other patience.
The one is necessary for him,
But the other is very dear to him.
He lays aside his revenge,
For to conserve patience.
He pardons with joy:
He punishes with sorrow.
He pardons by inclination:
He punishes out of necessity.
If we are Subjects, let us obey our King.
If we are Children, let us do the will of our Father.
If we are Disciples, let us follow the example of our Master.
Why do you hate your Brother?
Is he not a man like you?
Is he not a Christian as you are?
If you hate him because he is a sinner,
You ought to hate all men.
Were you just when JESUS loved you?
What would have become of you,
If he had not loved sinners?
The wrong that is don you, is a small matter,
If you consider the wrong you do to God.
You are slighted. Have you not deserved it?
Can one that is damned be slighted enough?
Your goods are taken from you.
Was it not God that gave them to you?
Has he not a right to recall them,
When he pleases, and by whom he pleases?
Do not call him an enemy,
Who makes you get Heaven.
If he have offended you,
He shall be soundly punished for it.
His damnation is unavoidable,
Unless he make you satisfaction.
Can you push on your hatred beyond Eternity?
Leave the revenge to God,
It Is a right that belongs to him.
Keep patience for your self,
It Is the pain that is due to your iniquities.
God is for you a Rule of Mercy,
You are for him a Rule of Justice.
Unless you use mercy as he does,
He will draw vengeance as you do.
If you love: he will love you.
If you hate: he will hate you.
If you excuse: he will excuse you.
If you condemn: he will condemn you.
If you pardon: he will pardon you.
If you punish: he will punish you.
O JESUS!
When I see you dying on the Cross,
I have no more gall in my heart.
When I hear you praying for your enemies,
I have nothing but tenderness for mine.
My Father,
Forgive those that have offended me,
They knew not what they did;
And they did but what I deserved.
Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. Luke 6.

Love your enemies, do well to those that hate you. ibid.

If you forgive men their sins, your heavenly Father will forgive your sins:
but if you do not forgive men, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you
yours. Matthew. 6.

XLV. MED. Of the Judgment of Men.
WIll you always be a slave to men?
Will you never contemn human respect?
Why do not you declare your self for God?
Why do not you renounce these Vanities?
Why do you not frequent the Sacraments?
Why do you not quit these Companies?
The World will laugh at you.
You have more reason to laugh at the World.
It is God's great enemy.
It Is the Tyrant of Faith.
The Persecutor of Innocence.
You have renounced its friendship,
When you were baptized.
If you will not renounce the World,
You must renounce JESUS.
What a baseness is it to make ones self a slave to men?
What a disloyalty to quit JESUS Christ's Party?
What a Treason to join with his enemies?
What an Impiety to blush at the Gospel?
Men will laugh at you.
It Is a testimony of your merit.
I should think you dishonored,
If you had the approbation of those,
Who approve of nothing, but what ought to be blamed.
The judgment of the wicked, is not the Rule of the good.
Must you cease to be wise, for fear of displeasing fools?
What right have the wicked to prescribe the Law to you?
Who has made you their Subject?
Are you afraid to be defamed by the infamous?
Do you apprehend to be dishonored by people of no honor?
The wicked condemn you.
The Sentence is null, and without authority,
When he that condemns, deserves himself to be condemned.
Is it any marvel, that a man should speak ill
Who knows not how to do well?
If the wicked have a tongue to accuse you,
You have two hands to answer them.
The contempt of the wicked is the commendation of virtue.
One cannot be a Christian,
Unless one contemn, and be contemned.
O JESUS my Lord!
How few Servants have you on Earth?
I see many Tyrants:
But I find no more Martyrs.
One only, What will men say, makes more Apostates,
Than all the Nero's ever made.
Alas! how will they endure the strokes of Scourges,
Who cannot endure the stroke of a Tongue?
How will he be a Martyr for his Faith,
Who dares not be one for Charity?
For my part I will never be ashamed of your Gospel.
I will make open profession of your Religion.
I care not to please those that displease you.
I abhor pleasing of those, whom you please not,
And whom you cannot please.
Be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord. 1 Timothy 3.

If I should please men, I should not be Christ's Servant. Gal. 2.

For all these things be not counfounded. and do not accept of a person to do
amiss, Eccles. 42.

For my part I make little reckoning. that I am judged by you, or by human
light. 1 Cor. 4.

XLVI. MED. Of Avarice.
IF you desire the goods of the Earth,
You will lose the goods of Heaven.
The Avaricious man loses his faith.
He has Sentiments contrary to the Gospel.
He esteems those happy, whom JESUS calls miserable.
And esteems those miserable, whom JESUS calls blessed.
Faith combats his passion, and his passion combats faith.
He cannot preserve both the one and the other.
If therefore he will preserve his faith,
He must renounce his passion.
The Avaricious man loses his Hope;
For who can hope for what he believes not.
The covetous man contemns the eternal goods.
He esteems only temporal ones.
He does nothing for to gain Heaven.
He labors only for the Earth.
He never prays to God.
He expects no good from him.
He gives no Alms.
He has an unsatiable desire.
He is an Idolater of money.
He sacrifices his thoughts to it.
He makes it his last end.
He elevates it above God.
He adores it as the beginning of his happiness.
He places all his hopes on it.
The Avaricious man loses Charity.
His heart is where his treasure is.
No man can serve two Masters:
Nor love God and Money.
Avarice takes up the whole heart.
It will endure no division thereof.
One must commit great injustices,
For to make great gains.
He that has a mind to grow rich,
Takes all that he can take.
Nature contents her self with little,
But Passion has no bounds.
He steals without measure,
Who desires without moderation.
Lawful gains are slow.
They follow the course of nature.
Great profits, are great Robberies.
Great fortunes ordinarily, are great injustices.
How can a covetous man be saved?
He does not acknowledge his sin.
He does no penance for it.
He never will make any restitution.
That which is easily taken,
Is with great difficulty restored.
Stolen waters are sweeter,
Than those whose use is permitted.
All passions contribute to theft.
They all fight in defense of it.
O my God! let me not be tormented for earthly goods.
You know where my treasure is.
Alas! shall we damn our selves for goods that we must leave?
We brought nothing into this World,
It Is certain we shall carry nothing out.
Happy is he who contents himself with God,
And who places all his confidence in him.
Gold and Silver are the Gods of the Gentiles,
But the God of Heaven is mine.
Do not labor to become rich: but put a bound to thy industry. Prove. 23.

Trust not in iniquity, and covet not rapins: if riches abound, lay not your
heart to them. Psalm. 61.

He that hastens to grow rich will not be innocent. Prove. 17.

Those that desire to become rich, fall into the temptation, and into the snare
of the Devil. 1 Timothy 6.

There is nothing more wicked than a covetous man: for his very soul is to be
sold. Eccles. 10.

How hard shall those that have moneys enter into the Kingdom of God? for it is
an easier thing for a Camel to pass through the eye of a Needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Luke 18.

XLVII. MED. Of Relapse.
THe more a sin is forgiven,
The less pardonable it is.
The more it increases in quantity,
The more it increases in malice.
Relapses are dangerous.
Old wounds are incurable.
Acts pass into custom.
Custom becoms a necessity.
Sins become greater.
Habits stronger.
Grace weaker.
Cooperation slacker.
The Spirit more blinded.
The Will weaker.
Passions more rebellious.
Remedies slower.
The Devils more powerful.
Their possession more powerful.
What ingratitude after so many benefits?
What contempt after so much knowledge?
What perfidiousness after so many promises?
What malice after so many promises?
Is it thus that we mock God?
That we fail in our word to him?
That we sport at his patience?
Abuse his goodness?
Contemn his justice?
Presume of his mercy?
Combat his gentleness?
VVast his graces prodigally?
Stifle his Spirit?
Drive him out of our hearts?
Prefer Lucifer before him?
After abundance, comes poverty.
After graces, com punishments.
After patience, fury.
After contempt, revenge.
O my God!
I dare no more appear before you.
After so many Contempts and Ingratitudes,
After so many Treacheries and Disloyalties,
My sins have almost changed their nature.
They were only Frailties;
But now they are hardnesses of heart.
They were pardonable faults,
They are now inexcusable Crimes.
Their number is infinite.
Their load unsupportable.
Their malice irremissible.
Their cure almost desperate.
But if my sins are great,
Your mercy is yet greater.
My sins are finit: Your mercy infinite.
I may go to Heaven, until such time as I am in Hell.
I may be converted as long as I am alive.
O! I will save my self in good earnest.
I am weary of being wicked.
My God, take my life away,
Unless I change my life.
Take me quickly out of this World,
Unless I do draw off from the World.
It is impossible for them that were once illuminated, and have tasted also the
heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost: and have moreover
tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to com, and are
fallen, to be renewed again to Penance. Hebr. 6.

If what I have destroyed, I build up again, I make my self a Prevaricator.
Gal. 2.

Behold you are now cured, sin no more, least something worse befall you. John 5.

The latter things are become worse than the first. Luke 11.

XLVIII. MED. Of Customary Sins.
It Is a great evil, to accustom one's self to evil.
A habit of sin, is a chain of iniquity,
Which captivates the Soul,
And inslaves her to sin.
It lessens our knowledge.
It hardens the heart.
It lulls the Conscience asleep.
It blots out shame.
The oftener one commits a sin.
The less one blushes to commit it.
At first one commits it with a horror.
One reiterates it with fear.
One continues it with pleasure.
One persevers therein with contempt.
These are the gradual steps of iniquity.
Hither it is that a habit of sin leads us.
That body is very sick, that feels not its sickness.
An inveterate sinner is almost desperate.
He knows not his own misery.
He cannot hate it.
He finds pleasure in it.
He will not get out of it.
His resolves are without effect.
His efforts without perseverance.
His Vices, in fine, pass into nature,
And his habit into necessity.
When the weight of Custom lies heavy upon the inclination:
When the Current of Passion finds nothing to resist it:
It Is a Torrent that draws all after it:
A Tyrant that destroys all:
It Is a Law of Iniquity, that domineers over the Will:
It Is a second Cuncupiscence,
More tyrannical, than that we are born with:
It Is a second nature, more corrupt than the first.
In vain does grace attack a heart that sins by Custom.
It is insensible to her touches.
It is impenetrable to her strokes.
One may sooner blanch a Moor,
Than cure an inveterate evil.
One may sooner root up a Tree,
Than pluck up an old Sin.
In what state are you?
Do you sin through ignorance?
Through Passion?
Through Frailty?
Through Custom?
Without Remorse?
Without Sorrow?
With Pleasure?
With Contempt?
Do you blush no more at your sin?
Do you commit it with assurance?
Do you glory in committing it?
Are you not afraid when you have committed it?
O then you are a slave to vice.
Your sins: are passed into your nature.
You are now hardened.
You are now grown insensible.
Alas! if you were sensible of your evil,
There would be some hopes of life.
Beg your cure of God.
Do your best to break your chains asunder.
Resist small Temptations,
And you will obtain the victory over great ones.
Do the things that are easy,
And God will do those that are difficult.
Help your Neighbor,
And God will help you.
Show mercy to him,
And God will show it to you.
Without a miracle you will not be cured.
Without Charity you will obtain nothing.
Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that you obey the concupiscence
thereof. Romans 6.

If an Ethiop can change his skin you may also do well having learnt to do ill.
Jer. 13.

My scars are grown rotten, and are corrupted. Ps. 37.

My iniquities have over-topped my head. ibid.

A young man according to the way of his youth: so will he be in his old age.
Prove. 21.

XLIX. MED. A Preparation to Death.
ARe you prepared to die?
Have you given order to your affairs?
Have you any affair greater than that of your Salvation?
Do you think to escape death?
That which must happen one day,
May it not happen this day.
You think of nothing but of living,
And you ought to think of nothing but dying.
You labor only for the time present,
And you ought to labor only for Eternity.
Small care, for small affairs.
Great care, for great affairs.
It Is too late to think of dying,
When it is time to die.
A wise man never undertakes a business of importance,
Without having first thought well on it.
Every one learns his own Trade.
To be saved is all men's Trade.
There needs no study to learn to die.
There needs much to learn to die well.
One can never do that well,
Which one does but once.
To know how to die well,
One ought to die often.
Death is but one only.
The fault committed therein,
Is an irreparable fault.
That Actour acts his part but ill,
Who never exercised himself.
A Lawyer pleads a Cause but badly,
Who never prepared himself for it.
It Is a hard matter to die well,
When one is acquainted only with the trade of life.
Is our life too long to dispose our selves for death?
Have we too much time to prepare our selves for Eternity?
VVatch, or you will be surpised.
Prepare your self for Death,
Or else you will die unprepared.
He that watches not, is surpised.
He that is surpised, is damned.
Learn that Trade, which you must of necessity make use of.
How important is it to do well,
That which you will do but once?
Where it is dangerous to fail:
Whose fault is without redress:
And whose punishment will have no end.
Do not trust to time:
It Is but a bad security:
It has cozened many a man.
If you trust it, it will infallibly deceive you.
O my God!
I thank you for having given me time,
To prepare my self for death.
Where had I been, had you surpised me?
I will henceforth stand upon my guard.
That I may one day die well,
I will die every day.
I will die many times,
That I may die once well.
Remember that death does not tarry. Eecles. 14.

Watch, because you know neither the day nor the hour. Matthew. 25.

VVatch at all times. Luke 21.

If thou do not watch I will come to thee like a Thief. Apoc. 3.

Therefore be ye prepared because in what hour you think not the Son of Man
will come. Matthew. 24.

L. MED. How to resolve for Death.
WHat do you fear, O Christian Soul?
Whence is it that you apprehend Death?
Cannot you endure, that which a little Infant does endure?
Cannot you do that which an Emmot does?
All Creatures know how to die,
And are you ignorant of this Science?
What will you do with life,
If you will never part with it?
Was it not God that gave it you?
Has not he a right to dispose of it?
He has given you the use of it,
But has reserved the property thereof to himself.
It Is a trust that you must restore to him,
Sooner or later, in a good condition.
To what purpose do you stand trifling?
You must pass that way.
It Is a folly to apprehend too much,
What one cannot avoid.
We fear things that are doubtful:
But we expect things that are certain.
You should not have been born,
If you had no mind tody.
Are you in a better condition than Kings?
Shall you be more privileged than JESUS Christ?
For my part, were I immortal,
I would beg it as a favor,
To be able to die as he did.
Are not you a Criminal?
Are not you condemned to death?
The Sentence thereof, was pronounced
Against Adam, from the time that he sinned.
O how favorable is this Sentence!
O how much good does it procure us!
Death is no more a punishment.
It Is an inestimable benefit.
We should ask it as a favor,
If God had not condemned us to it.
The Judgments of God are terrible,
But his Mercies are infinite.
It is good to fear,
But it is better to hope.
He that hopes in God,
Shall not be deceived.
He that leaves himself to God,
Shall not be forsaken.
Will your Condition be made better,
By living yet longer?
You will increase your debts,
Instead of diminishing them.
You say, that you will do Penance,
And you are yet to begin.
It Is a Penance of great merit,
To accept of death as a punishment.
Man can do no action for God,
Comparable to the Sacrifice of his life.
O my God!
How happy do I esteem my self,
That it is in my power to die for you.
I cannot be a Martyr for the Faith,
But I will be a Martyr of Charity.
To die is no great matter:
But to die well, is a great matter.
I give to you, O my God, out of love,
What death will take from me by force.
I give to you out of charity,
What I cannot refuse out of necessity.
Better is death than a bitter life: and eternal rest than continual sickness.
Eccles. 30.

O Death, good is thy judgment to an indigent man, and whose strength decays in
his old age. Eccles. 41.

Fear not the judgment of Death, remember what things were before thee: and
what things will come after thee: this is God's judgment on all flesh. Eccles.
41.

We know if this earthly house of ours of this habitation be dissolved, that
we have a building from God, not made with hands, but eternal in heaven. 2 Cor.
5.

Unhappy man that I am, who will deliver me from the body of this death. Romans 6.

LI. MED. The Affections of a just Soul at the approaches of Death, which we
should cause to be read to us in our last sickness.
I Am told, that I must die.
O the sweet and pleasant news!
I am quitting Earth to go to Heaven.
Going out of my Prison for to re-enter into liberty.
Quitting a Banishment for to return to my dear Country.
Passing from Time to Eternity.
From the figure to the truth.
From Change to Immutability.
From Death to Immortality.
From Misery to Felicity.
I am going to possess God.
To enjoy God.
To be transformed into God.
To fill my Understanding with a plenitude of light.
My Will with a plenitude of peace.
My Memory with a plenitude of goods.
My Senses with a fullness of pleasures.
I shall there above find all that I desire,
And nothing of what I fear.
I shall have no more evil.
I shall want nothing that is good.
God will be to me All in all,
And be so for all Eternity.
I am told that I am dying,
O the sweet news!
I shall be no more oppressed with miseries.
Suffer no more incommodities.
Be no more afflicted with sickness.
No more subject to commit sin;
Nor in danger of damning my self;
Nor any more have any thing to trouble me.
I shall see, and I shall love;
I shall praise, and I shall bless.
This I shall do for ever,
Without ever being weary of doing it.
O what a happiness! I am going to die.
I am going to the place of my repose.
To the Land of the living:
To the Kingdom of peace:
To the Palace of glory:
To the Nuptials of the Lamb:
To sit at God's Table:
To eat the bread of Angels:
To see what eye has not seen.
To hear what ear has not heard.
To possess what the heart of man has never conceived.
O the happy News!
They tell me I am dying.
Come my Soul! Let us quit this miserable life.
Let us go out of this wretched body.
What art thou afraid of?
Jesus is dead for thee.
He has satisfied for thy sins.
He has paid all thy debts.
He is become thy security.
He has answered for thee.
He has promised thee his Heaven.
He has declared thee his Heir.
He has made thee a surrender of all his Merits.
He has given thee his Body, as a Pledge.
He has bestowed infinite benefits on thee.
He has preserved thee from infinite dangers.
If he would have destroyed thee,
Would he have died for thee?
Would he have conserved thy life so long?
Have expected thee with so much patience?
Given thee time to do penance?
Have illuminated thee with so many lights?
Called thee with so much love?
Drawn thee with so much force?
Favored thee with so many graces?
Given thee so many good desires?
Visited thee in thy sickness?
Made thee receive his Sacraments?
Marked thee with the Seal of the Predestinate?
If thou sighest, thou shall be saved.
If thou art converted in thy heart,
Thy sins shall be forgiven thee.
One sigh is sufficient to gain Heaven.
The Penance that is true, is never don too late.
He is always converted time enough,
Who is converted from the bottom of his heart.
Behold JESUS calls you.
Behold JESUS stretches out his arms to you.
Hark, how he prays for you on his Cross.
Hark, how he says, with a loud voice,
Father forgive him, for he knew not what he did.
He bows down his head to kiss you.
He spreads his arms for to embrace you.
His heart is open for to let you into it.
He has given his life for to save you.
O happy news! They say I am to die.
Come! I am content.
I willingly resign up my life.
I render it to him, that gave it me.
I remit my spirit into his hands.
I recommend unto him my body and my soul.
I am sorry that I have offended him.
I accept of death, for to satisfy him.
I believe all that he has revealed.
I hope for all that he has promised.
I give him all that I possess.
I will die for his glory.
I will die for his sake.
I will die in gratitude.
I will die for justice sake.
I will die because he died.
I will die for him as he died for me.
I will die that I may see him.
I will die that I may love him.
I will die that I may bless him.
And for to sing his Praises for all Eternity.
O Father of mercy!
Behold a Prodigal Child,
Who has wasted all your goods:
Who has spent his life in Debaucheries:
That returns now to your house,
And who most humbly begs your pardon.
Alas! I have lived without reason,
Since I have had the use of reason.
I have don nothing but evil,
Since I knew what was good.
My Father!
I have sinned against Heaven, and against thee.
I deserve not to bear the name of thy Child.
I am not worthy to enter into thy house.
But have you ceased to be a Father,
Because I have ceased to be your Child?
Have you lost your goodness,
Because I have lost my innocence?
Are you no more a Father of mercy,
Because I am become a Child of misery?
O my Father! O the best of all Fathers!
Have pity on the miserablest of all thy Children.
I was lost, and I am now retrieved.
I was dead, and I am risen again.
I was gone far from you, and now,
I am here ready to appear before you.
O my Father! Come and meet your Child.
Give him a kiss of peace.
Forgive him his offenses.
Revest him with a Nuptial Robe.
Receive him into your house.
Give him a place at your Feast.
O JESUS!
The Physician of the poor sick.
The Comforter of the poor afflicted.
The hope of poor Sinners.
Here am I before you without strength,
Without motion, without speech:
But my heart says inwardly,
Come, O my JESUS, come quickly,
Draw my Soul out of this Prison,
Recall me out of this exile,
Conduct me to my dear Country.
Behold the Just do there expect me.
My friends hold forth their arms to me.
O how beautiful are thy Tabernacles!
O how admirable is thy Palace!
O how contented shall I be in Heaven!
O how happy shall I be in your Company!
I die with a desire of dying.
Com, divine Savior, and make me languish no more.
O holy Mother of God!
Who did see thy Son dying;
Lo here thy Child is sick!
Forsake him not in this extremity.
Com, and receive his Spirit,
And defend him from his enemies.
O ye Angels of Heaven!
Com down upon Earth to help me.
Make a guard round about me.
Drive away from me the Infernal Lion.
Preserve me even unto my Death.
After having saved me from so many Shipwracks,
Suffer me not to perish in the Haven.
Come let us go to Heaven.
Let us go to Paradise.
My heart is ready,
O my God, my heart is ready.
It is ready to stay here on earth.
It is ready to go hence.
It is ready to live.
It is ready to die.
Thy will be don.
I recommend my body and soul to you.
I rejoiced in the things that were said to me, we will go into our Lord's
house. Psalm. 121.

Blessed are those that die in our Lord. Apoc. 14.

Blessed are those that are called to the Nuptials of the Lamb. Apoc. 19.

In thee, O Lord, have I hoped: I shall not be confounded for ever. Ps. 30.

What is there to me in Heaven, and what besides thee would I have on Earth?
my flesh and my heart have fainted. O the God of my heart, and my portion, God
for ever! Ps. 72.

I am straightened on both sides: having a desire to be dissolved, and be with
Christ, much more better. Phil. 1.

One thing have I asked, that will I require, that I may dwell in the house of
our Lord all the days of my life. Ps. 26.

How beloved are thy Tabernacles, O God of Hosts, my soul does long and faint
after the Courts of our Lord. Ps. 83.

Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord, they shall praise thee for
ever and ever. Ps. 83.

All this Psalm is full of sweet thoughts to raise in a sick person a desire of
Heaven.

If thou do observe iniquities, O Lord, who can sustain? Ps. 126.

With our Lord there is mercy, and with him a copious redemption. ibid.

LII. MED. A Paraphrase on our Lord's Prayer, for the comfort of the sick.
Our Father I Believe, O my God, that you are my Father, who have given me the
life of my soul and body for to serve and love you: and which you have repaired
by the Death of your Son, after I had miserably lost it through my sin. You are
the Father of all men, and of the most miserable of all men, whom you see here
extended on this Bed. O how glad am I, that I have such a Father! So good, so
wise, so holy, so powerful. I hope that since you have given ^ne a temporal
life, you will do me the favor ^lso to give me an eternal one. O my Father,
(...) render back unto you the life which you have given me! I am sorry, that I
have employed it so ill; and that I have used it to offend you therewith. My
Father! I have sinned against Heaven and against you: I am not worthy to bear
the quality of your Child: but receive me, I beseech you, into the number of
your Servants.

My Father, if it be possible, let this Chalice of Death and Sufferance pass
from my mouth: and let me not drink it as yet. Yet let your Will be don, and
not mine.

My Father, glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you: and since I have
not honored you upon Earth, make me praise you Eternally in Heaven.

Which art in Heaven, Alas! you are in Heaven, and I am yet here upon Earth:
You are in a place of peace, and I am in a place of warfare: You are in Heaven
for to reward me, and I am on Earth for to honor you. I hope, O my God, that I
shall soon be with you in Heaven: I hope so, on the merits of the precious
blood, which your Son has shed for me. O when will that day com? How tedious
is it to live banished from your presence? How the Earth displeases me, when I
lift up my eyes to Heaven? O Heaven! O Heaven! What ought not we to do, to gain
thee? What ought not we to suffer, for to obtain thee? All that I endure is
nothing in comparison of what I hope for.

Hallowed be thy Name. O admirable name of God! I came into this World for to
sanctify thee, and I have don nothing but profane thee. I came upon Earth for
to give glory to thee, and I have don nothing but dishonored thee. I have
glorified my own name, instead of glorifying of thine. I have made known my own
name, instead of making known thine. I beg thy pardon for it, O God of Glory
and Majesty: and since I have not honored thee, during my life, I will honor
thee in my Death. I die for thy glory, and for to acknowledge the Immortality of
thy Being, by the destruction of mine. I wish I were able to render you as much
glory by my death, as your beloved Son rendered you by his. O why can I not make
you to be beloved by all hearts? make you be praised by all mouths? O holy name
of JESUS! Thou art all my hopes. Whosoever shall call upon thee, shall be
saved. I invocate thee with love, and with respect, suffer me not then to be
damned.

Thy Kingdom com. My God! When will that time come? When will you reign
absolutely in my heart? When shall I reign peaceably in yours? Alas! I have not
made you reign upon Earth: I have all my life long protested, That I had no
other King but Caesar. I have given up my heart, which is your Kingdom, to the
power of the Devil. I have made all your enemies to reign therein.

But my God! Through your grace, I acknowledge my fault, and my perfidiousness,
I confess that I deserve death. I accept of it, with all my heart, in
satisfaction for my sins. I hope that you will admit me into your Kingdom,
although I have driven you out of mine.

O my God! How happy are those, who dwell in your house, for they shall praise
you for ever and ever. Happy are those that serve you here on Earth, for they
shall reign with you in Heaven.

Comfort thy self, O my Soul! Behold, the Kingdom of God is at hand. Thou have
but one moment to suffer in, and thou shall have an Eternity to rejoice in.
What ought not one to do for to gain a Crown? What ought not one to suffer for
to get Heaven?

Thy Will be don on Earth, as it is in Heaven. My God! I feel great pains. My
Body is overwhelmed with Sufferings. Death assaults me on all sides. I cannot
resist its Batteries. It presents me my Chalice to drink, which is very bitter.
Is there no means to remove it from my mouth? Yet let thy Will be don, and not
mine.

My God! My Soul is in her Agony. My Spirit is disturbed at the approaches of
Death. She apprehends this passage, and has difficulty to quit her Body. She
would fain stay a little longer here upon Earth, for to redeem the time past,
and repair the losses, she has been the cause of. Must she drink this Chalice?
Can not she be dispensed from it? My God, let your will be don, and not mine.
Let me do it at my death, since I have not don it in my life.

O my God! If it were in my power not to die: I would beg Death of you as a
favor, that I might sacrifice to you, what I have dearest in this World,
thereby to imitate your Son; thereby to acknowledge his love, and for to drink
in his Chalice.

O I will be consummated upon this bed of sorrow, and upon the Altar of my
Cross, as a a Victim of your greatness; as a Victim of your Justice; as a
Victim of your Love; as a Victim of your Grace; as a Victim of your Glory.

Give us this day our daily bread. Happy is he that shall eat bread in the
Kingdom of God. I thank you, O charitable Father, for all the corporal and
spiritual goods, that you have bestowed on me, during this life: and above all,
for the bread of Angels, which I have so often eaten, and with so little fruit.
O bread of life! I am no more afraid of death, since I have eaten thee in this
my last sickness. I will march on, being fortified with this bread, till I com
to the Mount Oreb, which is the clear sight of God.

O Eternal Truth! You have promised and sworn, That he who shall eat your Body,
and drink your Blood, shall live eternally. This is that, which grounds my
hopes: This is that, which disperses my fears. Since we have been united
together in this life, I hope we shall not be divided asunder in the next.

O JESUS! Give me my bread this day. Strengthen me with your graces, that I may
compass the great journey of Eternity, and that I may persever to the end.
Without this bread I shall faint, and shall never be able to get to Heaven.

Forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us. Lord,
the number of my sins is infinite. If you keep an account of our iniquities,
alas! who will be able to subsist? I expect my Salvation from your mere grace,
and not from your justice. I can, no more, do penance. I am no longer in a
condition to pray or to fast. What shall I then do to appease your justice, and
to secure my Salvation.

You have promised to forgive him that forgives: to show mercy to him that
shows it. I do with all my heart forgive those who have offended me: and I pray
you to forgive them, and not to lay to their charge the ill they have don me.
Alas, they knew not what they did. Forgive me, my God, as I forgive them.
Forget the evil that I have don to you, as I forget, that which they have don
to me.

And lead us not into Temptation. Now it is, O my God, that I stand in need of
your protection, and your assistance. See how all my enemies surround me on all
sides. The roaring Lion is com out of Hell for to devour me: But if you are
with me, what need I fear? Although I should walk in the midst of the shadow of
death, I shall apprehend nothing, being in your company. Although I were
besieged by an Army encamped round about me, my heart would not be astonished.
Although all the Devils of Hell were ready to enter into combat against me, I
would not tremble, since you are with me, and that you make me hope, that I
shall have your assistance.

Arise then, O God of Hosts, com quickly to my succor. Send St. Michael with
his Troops, to relieve me. You know my weakness: there is none greater in the
World. Preserve me therefore, O my God, from Temptation; at least suffer me not
to yield unto Temptation.

But deliver us from evil. From evil of body, which I have very well deserved:
from the evil of the Soul, which I am threatened with. Deliver me from the
greatest of all evils, which is that of Eternity. This is the only sole evil
that I apprehend. I accept of all the rest, that you shall think fit to send
me. I am ready to go to Purgatory for to satisfy your Justice. But, O God of
mercy, I conjure you by the precious blood of your Son, and for the love that
his holy Mother bore him, send me not into Hell, where no body praises you, nor
loves you. Call me to Heaven, where I shall see you, where I shall love you,
where I shall praise you for all Eternity. Amen. So be it.

One may also read to the Patient, the Meditations upon the last words of
JESUS, upon the Cross, which are in the Third Part.

THE SECOND PART OF THE Meditations FOR THE ILLVMINATIVE LIFE.
LIII. MED. Of the care of our Perfection.
BE ye perfect like your Heavenly Father.
A Child ought to resemble his Father.
An Image its Original.
An Effect its Cause.
A Disciple his Master.
He that advances not in Christ's School,
Deserves not to be his Disciple.
Not to advance, is to go backward.
Not to amend, is to grow worse.
Not to gain, is to lose.
One cannot stand still on a River,
Without going down, or up.
If you stop, you go down.
If you rest, you go backward.
If you once say, It Is enough, you undo your self.
One must labor much, for to be perfect.
God possesses his happiness without motion.
The Angel gets his with a small motion.
Man coms to his with much motion.
All things are wanting to him,
Who thinks that he wants nothing.
Grace will not be barren.
Love cannot be idle.
It Is a fire that never says, It Is enough.
Either it burns, or it goes out.
Either it increases, or diminishes.
The Talent is taken from him,
Who does not improve it.
The Tree is cut down, that bears nothing.
O my God!
How much time have I lost?
How many Graces have I squandred away?
How little virtue have I?
How little improvement have I made?
All the World advances:
I only go backward.
The Tradesman learns his Trade,
And yet I learn not mine.
The Scholar becomes learned,
And I am still ignorant.
Every one strives to be perfect,
Only I will still be imperfect.
O my Divine Master!
Forgive me what is past,
And I will henceforward do better.
Alas! I have not yet begun.
Oh! What a way have I to go?
O how I fear to be surpised with night.
Let us run for to win the prize.
Let us advance, that we may not be surpised.
Be ye therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. Matthew. 5.

Do not you know, that those who run a Race, all run; and but one gains the
Prize: so run, that you may get it. 2 Cor. 9.

I therefore do so run, not as in uncertain: I so fight, not as beating the
air: but I chastise my body, and bring it into servitude. 1 Cor. 4.

I said, Now I have begun: this is a change of the right hand of the highest.
Ps. 76.

LIVE. MED. Of Prayer, and the Difficulties that occur therein.
WHy are we obliged to pray?
For to honor God's Majesty.
To yield an homage to his grandeur.
To acknowledge his Providence.
To testify to him our dependency on him.
To stir him up to do us good.
To put our selves in a condition of receiving good from him.
To enlarge our hearts.
To make them capable of his graces.
Prayer unites us to God.
It fastens us to his Divine Breasts.
It squeezes the Milk of Grace out of them.
It inriches us with his Bounties.
It supplies our Necessities.
It fills up our Wants.
It makes us powerful, like God.
It makes us triumph over God.
That body is dead, that breaths not.
That Soul is dead, that prays not.
Whence coms it that I obtain nothing of God?
It Is because you ask evil things.
It Is because you ask, being in all ill state.
Without Attention:
Without Devotion:
Without Humility:
Without Confidence:
Without Perseverance.
Prayer penetrates Heaven.
It gets all that it asks.
God can refuse it nothing.
As his nature is nothing but goodness,
He desires nothing but to pour himself out.
He is a Nurse that has too much Milk.
He seeks about every where for an empty heart,
For to fill it with his goods.
He has engaged his word.
It Is his Son that prays in us.
He has given us his spirit.
He has transferred his merits on us.
What may we not obtain,
By offering to God the merits of his Son?
Whence com my distractions?
They com from the Devil,
Who would give us a disgust of Prayer.
They com from your Imagination,
Which is light and volatile.
They com from your spirit,
Which busies it self with vain things.
They com from your heart,
Which is fastened to Creatures:
Which flies where its treasure lies:
Which converses with what it loves:
Which is not pleased with God,
Because it has no love for God.
They often com from the body,
Which loads and weighs down the spirit.
They com from the little care
You take of your perfection.
They com from your sloth.
They com from your infidelity.
There is nothing but Mortification,
That enkindles the fire of Prayer.
Whence coms it that I have no comfort?
It Is because you have no affliction.
Because you desire it with too much passion.
Because you seek it in Creatures.
It Is for to beat down your pride.
To keep you in humility.
To make you know your self.
To make you sensible of your weakness.
To stir up your desire.
To punish your negligence.
To spur up your sloth.
To exercise your patience.
To increase your merit.
To draw you off from your senses.
To make you live in Spirit.
To settle you in Faith.
To strengthen your Hope.
To purify your Love.
To try your Fidelity.
To make you a Spiritual man.
To make you set a value on grace.
To make you desire, conserve, recover it.
To show you the necessity of it,
For to moderate your Fervours.
To manage your health,
For to make you merit the good things,
Which God designs to bestow on you.
To prepare your heart,
For to receive some great favors.
It Is for to draw you from Meditation,
And make you pass to Union.
O my God!
I beg your pardon for having left off Prayer.
Alas! I thought you were angry,
When you showed me the greatest affection.
I will henceforth be more faithful.
I will humble my self in my Poverties.
I will expect your Visit with patience.
I will support all my states.
I will suffer all my disgusts.
It Is too much honor for me
To be in your presence.
Is it not to be in Heaven to be with you?
We know not what we ought to pray for: but the spirit himself does petition
for us with unexpressible groans. Romans 8.

Pray without intermission: in all things give thanks. 1 Thessalonians. 4.

Ask and it shall be given you: seek and you shall find: knock and it shall be
opened to you. Matthew. 7.

God is a Spirit, and those who adore him, must adore him in spirit and truth.
John 5.

You ask, and you receive not, because you ask ill. Jam. 4.

My prayer shall turn back into my bosom, and the speeches of my mouth shall be
acceptable to you, and the meditation of my heart in thy sight always. Ps. 15.

LV. MED. Of Faith.
It Is to be without Reason,
To be without Faith.
It Is not to be a Man,
Not to be a Christian.
Fath is above Reason, but Reason tells us,
That we must submit to faith.
That that man is not rational,
Who will not submit his reason
To the Principle of his reason.
That man is without understanding,
Who would by his reason comprehend
What is above his understanding.
Faith is not evident;
But reason shows evidently,
That we have the true Faith.
The Antiquity of our Religion.
The Establishment of our Religion.
The unavoidable continuance of our Religion.
The Miracles of our Religion.
The Extent of our Religion.
The Sanctity of our Religion.
The Majesty of our Religion.
The Doctors of our Religion.
The Witnesses and Martyrs of our Religion,
Do persuade all Understandings,
That there is no Religion in the World,
Or, that ours is the true one.
If the Church deceives me:
It Is God that deceives me.
If the Church leads me astray.
It Is God that leads me astray.
I would not believe the Gospel,
If the Church did not bid me believe it.
I should not receive the sense of the Scripture,
Unless the Church did bid me receive it.
One believes nothing, except he believes all.
For to be a Catholic one must believe
Universally: humbly: firmly: efficaciously.
O Truth my God!
You have placed your Throne in the Sun.
Your Church is as bright as the Sun.
She enlightens all the World like the Sun.
She gives life to all the World like the Sun.
O I will live and die a Child of your Church!
I am one of your Sheep,
I cannot live without a Shepherd.
I renounce all my own lights.
I submit my self to the lights of Faith.
My Religion would not be divine,
Unless it were above reason.
You would not be my God,
If you were not incomprehensible.
My heart could not adore you,
If my understanding could comprehend you.
My heart must submit to your Law,
And my Understanding to your faith.
Behold he that is incredulous, his soul will not be upright in himself: but
the just man shall live in faith. Hab. 2.

Faith is the substance of things to be hoped, an argument of things that
appear not. Heb. 11.

Reducing every understanding into captivity to the obsequiousness of faith. 2
Cor. 10.

Unless ye believe, ye will not understand. Isa. 7. according to the Septuagint.

We have a firmer Prophetical speech to which you do well to attend, as it were
to a light shining in the dark. 1 Pet. 3.

LVI. MED. Of the Conduct of Faith.
REason is the light of Man.
Faith is the light of a Christian.
To be a man, one must be rational.
To be a Christian, one must be a believer.
God is to be honored by my Understanding,
As well as by my Heart.
I honor God with my Heart,
When I obey his Law.
I honor him with my Understanding,
When I submit unto Faith.
My Heart submits its self entirely,
When it does that which does not please it.
My Understanding submits it self perfectly,
When it believes what it understands not.
Faith consecrates the spirit of man.
It makes him Religious.
It submits him to the authority of God.
It sacrifices him to his glory.
It unites him to his wisdom.
It fills him with his truth,
It makes him upright, like God.
It makes him certain and infallible, like him.
Faith discovers to us
The Mysteries of our Religion.
It conducts us to our End.
It conserves us in Unity.
It maintains us in Humility.
It sustains our Hopes.
It encourages our Charity.
It disposes us to Grace.
It makes us merit Glory.
Without Faith, the Spirit is profane.
It is a Libertin, and without Religion.
It wanders in its knowledge.
It loses it self in its Ratiocinations.
It rises not off from the Earth.
It merits nothing for Heaven.
It submits not it self to its Creator.
It obeys not its Sovereign.
It will never see the first truth.
O how great a gift of God's is Faith!
O how blind is that man that has not Faith!
O how rational it is to submit our Spirit to God.
My God!
I believe what I understand not.
I do what pleases me not.
I adore you by the submission of my thoughts.
I love you by the submission of my desires.
For to obey your Law,
We must renounce our own proper will.
For to obey your faith,
We must renounce our own lights.
That man is not your Subject,
Who will do nothing, but what pleases him.
That man is not your Disciple,
Who will not believe, but what he understands.
We walk by faith, and not by sight. 1 Cor. 5.

I will espouse thee to my self by faith: and thou shall know that I am the
Lord. Os. 2.

Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice. Romans 4.

He went forth, not knowing whither he was to go, Heb. 11.

VVilt not thou be subject to God, O my Soul? Ps. 61.

LVII. MED. Of Hope and Confidence in God.
HOpe, is a Divine Virtue,
Which leans upon her beloved.
She honors his goodness.
She renders homage to his grandeur.
She acknowledges his Providence.
Of Men, she makes us Gods.
Of Impotent, she makes us Omnipotent.
Of poor, she makes us rich.
We never ought to hope more,
Than when all things seem desperate.
We never ought to fear less,
Than when all things seem to be feared.
We never ought more to give our selves up,
Than when we think all is lost.
God gives his own subsistence,
To him that strips himself of his own.
God gives his Omnipotence,
To him that acknowledges his own weakness.
God gives all his Treasures,
To him, who owns his Poverty.
Abundance seeks out Indigence.
The weak man leans upon the strong man.
The strong man takes delight in the weak one.
God sustains that human nature,
Which relies only on his Divinity.
Be you without support,
And God will support you.
Have no Human subsistence,
And you shall have a Divine one.
Trust not to your own lights,
And you shall have the Wisdom of God.
Trust not to your own strength,
And you shall have the power of God.
Trust not to your own virtues,
And you shall have the holiness of God.
Alas, O my God! Who am I?
And who art thou?
Thou art my Being,
And I am a mere Nothing.
Thou art my strength,
And I am nothing but weakness.
Thou art my Holiness,
And I am nothing but malice.
O my God, and my hope! I leave my self to you.
I repose in you. I rely on you.
If I go astray, you shall be the cause of my stray.
If I fall, you shall be the cause of my fall.
If I ruin my self, you shall ruin me:
For I put all my trust in you.
You can neither ruin, nor lead me astray:
I therefore will be afraid of nothing,
Provided that I leave my self to you.
To know God, and not to know ones own misery,
Is that which begets Presumption.
To know our own misery, without knowing God,
Is that which begets Despair.
JESUS is not only a God,
But he is a God-Mediatour.
JESUS is no more JESUS,
If you take his mercy from him.
He is no more a Savior,
If he has no tenderness for a Sinner.
Who is she that comes up from the desert, leaning upon her beloved. Cant. 8.

Those who hope in our Lord, shall change their strength, they shall take wings
like Eagles, they shall walk, and not faint. Isa. 40.

Many are the scourges of a sinner, but him that hopes in our Lord, mercy shall
encompass. Psalm. 31.

Our Lord said to Gideon, you have much people with you, nor shall Madian be
delivered up into his hands, least Israel glory against me, and say, I was
delivered by my own strength. Judge. 8.

Command the rich men of this world, not to be highminded, nor to trust in the
uncertainty of their riches, but in the living God, who does bestow abundantly
on us all things for us to enjoy. 1 Timothy 6.

LVIII. MED. Of Charity.
CHarity is a treasure of Merit, that enriches us:
A treasure of Grace, that sanctifies us:
A treasure of Sanctity, which makes us perfect:
A treasure of Peace, which makes us happy.
Charity blots out all sins.
Calms all Passions.
Produces all Virtues.
Sweetens all Pains.
Makes us like unto God.
Unites us intimately to God.
Transforms us, in some kind, into God.
It makes God to be all ours;
And us all his.
Charity seeks not her self.
She loves for loves sake.
Her love is her pleasure.
Her love is her reward:
She is Humble: Patient: Mild: Doing good:
Is not bitter: Is not puffed up: Not disdainful.
Not envious: Believes all: Hopes all: Suffers all: Pardons all.
O Charity my God!
Why do you command me to love you?
Should not you rather have forbidden me?
Can there be a greater good, than to love you?
Can there be a greater ill, than not to love you?
Can you threaten me with a greater misery,
Than to forbid me to love you?
How is it possible not to love a God, that is so infinitely good?
A God who love us infinitely?
A God who does us infinite Benefits?
A God who is united to us by infinite Alliances?
And yet I love you not, O God of goodness!
I have in my heart only a Phantom of Charity.
I am Proud: Impatient: Troublesome:
Choleric: Doing ill: Envious.
I will suffer nothing.
Pardon nothing.
Alas! how shall I be saved,
Since I have no Charity?
O I have loved you too late,
Beauty always ancient, and always new!
O I will never cease from blessing you:
From praising you: from loving you!
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, Matthew. 22.

The end of the precept is Charity, out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and
an unfeigned faith. 2 Timothy 1.

Charity covers a multitude of sins. 1 Pet. 4.

Many sins are forgiven her, because she loved much. Luke 7.

God is Charity, and he that remains in Charity, remains in God, and God in
him. 1 John 4.

This is the charity of God, that we keep his Commandments. 1 John 5.

He that has my Commandments, and keeps them, it is he that loves me. John 14.

LIX. MED. Of Purity of Intention.
YOu belong wholly to God.
You are totally for God.
You have all from God:
You ought therefore to do nothing but for God.
Such is your Action, as is your End.
If your End be good, your action is good.
If your End be ill, your Action is ill.
If you have the same End with God,
Your Action will be holy as God's is.
God works only for himself,
And you work only for your self.
God seeks only his own glory,
And you seek only yours.
God would have you saved,
And you will damn your self.
If you will do nothing for him,
What must you expect from him?
If you be naught to your self,
Who will you be good to?
God looks not on the hand, but the heart.
He considers not the gift, but the giver.
So much you do, as you intend to do.
So much you give, as you intend to give.
So much you gain, as you intend to gain.
The Intention alone sometimes is profitable without the action;
But never the action without the intention.
You please God, if you intend to please him.
You love God, if you intend to love him.
Is not that a great comfort to you?
O I will never henceforth labor for the World!
O I will henceforth serve God!
Since you are pleased, O my God, when we intend to please you:
Since we love, in intending to love you:
You are the best of all Masters.
I will never more think on any thing,
But how to please and love you.
All men seek their own interefts. Phil. 2.

Do I seek to please men? Gal. 1.

If I should yet please men, I should not be Christ's servant. ibid.

Whether yeeat, or whether ye drink, or whatsoever else you do: do all things
to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 10.

LX. MED. Which is the noblest Intention.
WE never lose any thing by serving God.
The less we intend to get,
The more we get.
We may serve him for profit sake,
But this service is not so profitable.
True Love is contented with its self.
The thing it loves, is its reward.
That Love is suspected,
Which seeks any thing else with God.
That Love is mercenary,
Which expects any other good but God.
That Love is weak,
Which relishes any thing else but God.
That Love is perfect,
Which contents it self with God.
To labor for gain,
Is an interested service.
To labor for to perfect,
Is a Love that is not quite purified.
To labor for to please God,
Is a Love in its Infancy.
To labor because it pleases God,
Is Love in perfection.
My God!
I have not strength enough to fly so high.
My heart clings too much to the Earth,
To raise it self even above Heaven.
I will serve, before I love.
I will kiss your hand,
Before I kiss your mouth.
I will love your reward,
That I may have no other but your love.
O how rich shall I be,
When I labor for you only!
O how perfect shall I be,
When I desire to please none but you!
O how happy shall I be,
When I love nothing but you!
I have inclined my heart to do your justifications for retribution. Ps. 118.

IF I labor without disturbance:
Without eagerness: without a Witness.
As if there only God and I:

If I am not angry when my labor is interrupted.
If I am contented when my labor succeeds not.
If I love the bad as well as the good success.
If I love rest as well as business.
If I am pleased to do nothing,
When God will have it so,
As well as to do much.
If I love contempt as well as glory:
If I make no vain reflection,
After I have don a good action,
It Is a mark, that I had a good Intention.
O my God!

And I have gained but little.

And have treasured up but little.
I have walked hard, but advanced but little.
I have labored for Earth,
But have don nothing for Heaven.
I have labored for my body,
But I have don nothing for my soul.
I have labored for the time present,
But I have don nothing for Eternity.
I have labored for my self,
But I have don nothing for you.
O my Lord!
Since I am made only for you,
I will live only for you.
Since I subsist only by you,
I will labor only for you.
The reward of my service henceforth,
Shall be to have served you.
The recompense of my love,
Shall be to have loved you.
Then shall I seek nothing but you alone.
I shall find all things with you.
Is your heart right? 4 Kings 10.

Whom seek you? John 18.

LXII. MED. Of Humility.
WHo art thou, O my God, and who am I?
Thou art all, and I am nothing.

Thou can do all, and I can do nothing.
Thou art nothing but light,
And I am nothing but darkness.
Thou art nothing but fortitude,
And I am nothing but weakness.
Thou art nothing but sanctity,
And I am nothing but malice.
Thou art the Saint of Saints,
And I am the sinner of sinners.
Thou art the King of Kings,
And I am the slave of slaves.
O how strong am I with thee!
O how feeble am I without thee!
My Soul!
Either humble thy self,
Or God will humble thee.
What have thou that thou have not received?
Or can conserv of thy self?
What have thou, that thou can make good use of?
Thy Virtues, without Humility, will not save thee.
Thy Vices, with Humility, will not damn thee;
For Humility banishes all Vices,
And makes Charity enter into their room.
Were thou as wicked as Achab,
If thou humble thy self, God will not punish thee.
He resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
Can thou after this say,
That thy Salvation is impossible?
That the way to Heaven is hard?
Every one cannot exalt himself:
But who is it that cannot humble himself?
All the World cannot ascend.
But who is it that cannot descend?
I can do all things, if I can humble my self.
I cannot fast, but I can humble my self.
I cannot weep, but I can humble my self.
I cannot pray, but I can humble my self.
The virtue of Humility, supplies the want of Charity.

God will not despise a contrite and humble heart.
O my Soul!
Let us suffer contempt.
Let us contemn contempt.
Let us desire contempt.
Let us seek contempt.
Let us hide our Treasures,
Least we be robbed of them.
Let us humble our selves,
That God may exalt us.
Let us have an esteem for those innocent defects,
Which give us a confusion.
Let us love all that keeps us in abjection.
To be good, and to appear to be so,
Is a dangerous thing.
To appear to be good, and not to be so,
Is a vicious Hypocrisy.
To be good, and not to appear to be so,
Is a happy condition.
Humble thy spirit very much, for fire is the revenge of wicked flesh. Eccles.
7.

Com unto me all ye that labor, and you shall find rest to your souls. Matthew.

XLIII. MED. Of Patience.
ALl that I endure is nothing,
In comparison of the pain that I deserve.
In comparison of the glory prepared for me.
Of the evil which I have committed.
Of the good I have omitted.
Of Heaven that is promised me.
If I am without a Cross,
I am no Disciple of JESUS.
If I carry not my Cross,
I shall not reign with JESUS.
We must either suffer here, or in Eternity.
There Is no passing from Delights to Delights,
But from Delights to Torments.
There Is no passing from Happiness to Happiness,
But from Happiness to Misery.
When I suffer with patience,
Jesus suffers with me.
Jesus reigns in me.
I am the Victim of Love.
The Throne of his Grace.
The Trophy of his Glory.
I quit all my Debts.
I heap up great Treasures.
I practice all Virtues.
I have the mark of the Predestinate.
I free my self from Purgatory.
I secure my self of Heaven.
O JESUS my Savior!
I will honor all my Sufferings,
Since you have consecrated them.
I feel my Cross no more,
When I think on yours.
All my comfort is to think on your Passion.
Your torments sweeten my pains.
I should die with sorrow,
Should I live without sorrow.
The Sufferances of this time are not worthy of the glory, which shall be given
us hereafter. Romans 8.

Through many tribulations we must enter into the Kingdom of God. Act. 14.

SInce we must suffer in this World,
Let us not lose the fruit of our Sufferings.
Let us suffer for Jesus, with Jesus, as Jesus.
Let us suffer without complaint and murmuring.
With resignation and indifference.
With fortitude and constancy:
With joy and love.
Let us suffer all things: from all the World:
In all things: in all manner of ways.
Let us suffer: adore: love: and seek Crosses.
O Holy Cross!
I adore thee, and I embrace thee.
Since I am a Christian, and a Child of the Cross.
I will live and die on the Cross.
Thou art the Tree of life,
And the Salvation of the World.
Thou art the Sanctuary of Sinners,
And the comfort of the afflicted.
O! my greatest Cross shall henceforth be,
To live without a Cross.

LXV. MED. Of the Cross: or several Motives of Patience.
CArry your Cross, O Christian Soul!
You will find none fitter for you than your own.
If you leave it for to take another,
You will lose instead of gaining.
The Cross is planted every where.
It Is found in all manner of places.
There are Crosses in Kings Palaces,
As well as in Cloisters.
God will have all men to be saved.
He has provided Crosses for all,
Because none can be saved without a Cross.
The Cross bears admirable fruits.
It unloosens us from Creatures.
It gives us a disgust of this life.
Makes us desire death.
Satisfies for our sins.
Makes us feel the punishment of them.
Gives us a horror of them.
Destroys the habit of them.
Makes us like to Jesus Christ.
Makes us drink in his Chalice.
There is nothing more glorious, than to suffer.
Nothing more sweet: more wholesome:
More necessary, than to suffer.
What an honor is it to be Crucified with JESUS?
To be treated like one of his Members?
To ascend up his Royal Throne?
To carry his Scepter and wear his Diadem?
To consummate the work of his Redemption?
To fill up what is wanting to his Passion?
To express his suffering Figure?
To continue his Sacrifice?
To take a part in his Sorrows?
To help him to carry his Cross?
To be a Victim like him?
To be a Martyr like him?
To be persecuted like him?
To be immolated like him?
I adore Torments as Sacraments.
I look upon an afflicted man,
As on Jesus crucified.
I had rather suffer with Jesus,
Than reign with Jesus.
God chastizes those whom he loves.
He spares not the Rod to his Children.
If I am not corrected, I am not beloved.
If I am not God's Child, I shall not be saved.
God is never more in wrath,
Than when he puts not himself in wrath.
I never am more comforted,
Than when I find my self amidst Sufferings.
He that chastizes me for the present,
Will spare me in Eternity.
God always visits with his grace,
Those whom he visits with pain.
Grace is a fruit of the Cross.
You must climb the Cross to gather it.
You will never be without grace,
As long as you are on the Cross.
There is no virtue without a Cross.
No merit without patience.
Take away the Cross from Charity,
And it has no more tenderness.
Take away the Cross from Hope,
And it has no more support.
Take away the Cross from Humility,
And it is nothing but Vanity.
Take away the Cross from Fortitude,
And it is nothing but Weakness.
Money is not current,
Unless it be stamp't with the Prince's Coin.
The Wounds that are given to it,
Give it its value.
Unless you have Wounds,
You will have no merit.
Your Gold will not be current,
Unless it be marked with the Cross's Stamp.
How perfect is a Patient man?
All his Virtues are Heroic.
He believes that he is loved,
When he is afflicted.
That God makes much of him,
When he strikes him.
He hopes against hope.
He is calm in all events.
Immovable in his ruin.
Indefatigable in his labors.
He loves God without allurements.
He kisses the rods wherewith he is scourged.
He thinks himself unworthy of all goods.
He reckons himself worthy of all evils.
He leaves himself to his Providence.
He lets himself be led by Obedience.
He adores all Crosses as Relics of the true Cross.
God is wise: he knows well what he does.
He is good: therefore he wishes me well.
He is every where: the sees what I suffer.
He is omnipotent: he can deliver me.
He is rich: he can assist me.
He is just: Why should I complain?
He is charitable: Why should I despair?
He is patient: Ought not I to imitate him?
He is a King: Ought not be to govern?
He is Sovereign: Ought not he to command?
What a comfort is it to be on the Cross,
With JESUS Crucified?
He is with you upon your Cross,
And you are with him upon his.
He is united to you by sufferance,
And you are united to him by patience.
Is not this to be blessed,
To be thus united to him?
The Union in Heaven is delicious.
The Union on Earth is dolorous.
God created the World by acting;
But he repaired it by suffering.
He acts like a God, with those that act.
He suffers like a man, with those that suffer.
O my Soul! What greater joy,
Than to be with Jesus on the Cross?
You are a Christian only by the Cross.
You are no more one, if you be without a Cross.
It Is to renounce your Religion,
To be too much afraid of Sufferings.
You shall have a part in Jesus his Pleasures,
If you have a part in his Sorrows.
You shall accompany him in his glory,
If you will keep him company in his pains.
You shall reign with him,
Provided that you suffer with him.
One must fight for to be crowned.
One must suffer for to be saved.
Man lost himself by pleasure,
He cannot save himself but by pain.
JESUS lived in pain;
And You would live in pleasure.
The Innocent was punished:
And the Nocent would go free.
The Son was crowned with Thorns,
And the Slave would be crowned with Roses.
The Just man was elevated on a Cross,
And the Wicked man would ascend a Throne.
There is no greater Cross,
Than to have a horror of the Cross.
One endures more in damning ones self,
Than one endures in saving himself.
The wicked man suffers without pleasure.
He has no comfort in his pain.
His Cross has no Unction.
It Is the wicked Thief's Cross.
It has neither sweetness, nor merit.
No body helps him to carry it.
It Is the Cross of one in despair.
Let us honor: bear: love the Cross of Jesus.
It Is the mystical Ladder of Jacob.
It Is the Throne of Wisdom.
The Chair of the Man-God.
The Trophy of our Salvation.
The Standard of our Religion.
The Seal of Predestination.
The principle of grace.
The foundation of glory.
O Holy Cross! I adore thee.
Dear Spouse of the Son of God,
I kiss thee, and I embrace thee.
Disdain not the Servant,
because thou did bear the Master.
Disdain not the Criminal,
Because thou did bear the Innocent.
Disdain not a man,
Because thou have born a God.
O Holy Cross!
It Is to me that thou do belong.
The Holy one has no right in thee.
Thou art the portion of man:
Thou art the inheritance of the sinner.
The appennage of a Christian.
For me therefore thou were made.
Come, O Holy Cross, betwixt my arms.
Permit me to rest upon thine.
I have espoused thee in my Baptism.
Thy Marriage must be indissoluble.
Let nothing separate me from thee.
O Throne of grace and of mercy,
Raise me up from the Earth,
As thou did my Savior.
If I die betwixt thy arms,
I shall be both a Savior, and saved.
I shall gain Souls to God,
And shall not lose my own.
Blessed is the wood by the which justice is made. Wisd. 14.

Then Jesus said to his Disciples: if any one will come after me, etc. let him
take up his Cross. Matthew. 6.

The sinner has provoked our Lord to wrath, he will not seek after him
according to the multitude of his wrath. Ps. 9.

LXVI. MED. Of Conformity to the Will of God.
TO judge as God judges, is to be wise as God is.
To will as God wills, is to be holy as God is.
His judgment is the Rule of our judgments.
His will is the Rule of our wills.
God alone has right to do what he will.
He alone can have a will of his own.
Wilt not thou then, my Soul, obey God?
Will thou always make war against him?
Will thou wrestle with the Almighty?
Have thou measured thy arms with his?
Art thou wiser than he?
Will thou teach him to govern the World?
If thou will not do his Will,
Thou will take away his Crown.
Thou will ascend his Throne.
Thou will be independent as he is.
Is it just, that God should do thy will,
Or, that thou should do his Will?
How happy would thou be,
If thou would nothing but what God will?
In what a profound peace would thou live?
How would thy affairs change their face?
What cares and disquiets would thou spare?
God does the affairs of those who do his.
He obeys those who obey him.
He loves those that love him.
He contents those that content him.
Is it not to be in Heaven,
To will all that God wills?
Is it not to be in Hell,
To will nothing of what God wills?
A man does always his own will,
When he has no proper self-will.
A man never does what he will,
When he does not do what God will.
The Will of God is always don one way or other.
If I oppose him, he will oppose me.
If I afflict him, he will afflict me.
If I disturb him, he will disturb me.
If I serve him, he will serve me.
O my God!
There is no pleasure in displeasing you.
There is no profit in offending you.
Since I have been at odds with you,
I have been at odds with my self.
Since I have made war against you,
I never could find any peace.
Do with me what you please,
If I will not do what you will have me.
Make me serve you, if I will not love you.
Force me, if I will not obey you.
Draw me, if I will not follow you.
Good, and evil, life, and death, poverty, and honor, are from God. Eccles. 11.

Is fed with the same Sacraments, as I am.
Is designed to the same Heaven. as I am.

Jesus prays me, and orders me to do it.
He reckons it as don to himself,

Unless I love my Neighbor.

If I afflict him, God will afflict me.
If I excuse him, God will excuse me.
If I support him, God will support me.
If I pardon him, God will pardon me.
God will use me, as I have used him.
God will judge me according to my charity to him.
O I will then love him, that I may be beloved!
I will assist him, that I may be assisted.
I will support him, that I may be supported.
I will save him, that I may be saved.
I will love him Tenderly: Universally:
Generously: Constantly.
Thou shall love thy neighbor as to y self. Matthew. 12.

In this all shall know, that ye are my Disciples, if you have a love for one
another. John 3.

LXVIII. MED. Of the duty of Fathers to their Children, and of Masters toward
their Servants.
A Father owes to his Children
Nourishment of Body and Soul.
He must not bring them into the World,
For to send them to Hell.
Why will you be a Father,
Unless you will also be an Instructor?
What does it avail you to feed the Body,
If you leave the Soul forlorn?
The first life of Children,
Is but the life of Beasts.
They become men but with time.
It Is wise instruction that discloses their reason.
It Is a new Birth.
It Is the Organ of Faith.
It Is the Principle of Salvation.
It Is the Groundwork of Virtue.
Salvation and Damnation depend often upon Education.
Unhappy are those Children,
Whose Fathers will pardon them in nothing.
But much more unhappy are those,
To whom their Fathers grant all things.
A good education ought to be mildly severe.
Parents ought to imitate God,
Who does the office both of a Father, and Mother.
Of a Father by severity.
Of a Mother by tenderness.
One must not always punish,
Nor must one always pardon.
One must not always be silent,
Nor must one always chide.
Never correct a Child when you are in Choler.
A Physician that is sick must first cure himself.
A Father that is hurried along with passion,
Does himself deserve correction.
Punishment is a Medecin,
Which is to be given in its due time.
When Chastisement is just and moderate,
It gives Understanding.
But it creates a Contempt,
When it is used too often.
For to breed up ones Children well,
They are to be loved equally.
The partiality of affections,
Is the cause of all disorders.
Why should you make a difference,
Where Nature has made none?
Why should you violate the rights,
Which she has wisely established?
Ought not the Branches of the same tree,
Bear the same Leaves?
Nature acts by Inclination:
But those who love out of charity,
Do more good to those persons,
For whom they have most aversion.
Imitate God in his conduct.
Has he not more tenderness
For the Predestinate, than the Reprobate?
But he hides it in this life.
The wicked are not jealous of it.
He oftentimes shows more friendship
To those, by whom he has been most offended.
Instructions bring but little fruit,
Unless they be accompanied with example.
You destroy by your Actions,
What you build up by your Words.
The Hand advances more than the Tongue.
Example is more powerful than Discourse.
The Child gives more credit to his Eyes,
Than he does to his Ears.
He thinks he has a right to do,
What he sees his Parents do.
He places his glory in imitating them,
And his perfection in being like them.
All your sins are Scandals;
Which infect your Descendents.
They are inheritances of iniquity,
Which pass down to posterity.
Fathers! If you have Children,
Take care to instruct them.
Correct them moderately.
Love them all equally.
Hearken not to your Inclinations.
Follow not your Aversions.
Dissemble not their Disorders.
Flatter not their Passions.
Entertain not their Divisions.
Pardon when you ought to pardon.
But punish when you ought to punish.
Masters treat your Servants,
As if they were your Children.
They are not so by birth,
But by a kind of Adoption they are
God relies upon you,
For their Breeding and Education.
You owe to them, as to your Children,
Instruction, Correction, and Example.
Your Children and your Servants,
At the day of Judgment,
Will be your Judges and your Parties,
Your Witnesses, and your Accusers.
Son have thou Children, instruct them. Eccles. 7.

Fathers provoke not your Sons to wrath, that they may not become pusillanimous.
Gol. 3.

He that spares the rod, hates his Son. Prove. 13.

He that scandalizes one of these little ones, it were better that he had a
Millstone, etc. Matthew. 18.

Have pity on the fiercest of all Devils.
O most meek Lord!
Who did suffer thy self to be stripped
And put to death, without uttering a word,
Make me meek and patient in my pains.
O good Shepherd!
Who drivest away the Wolves from thy fold.
How do thou endure me in thy house?
How do thou endure me among thy sheep?
Either kill this Sanguinary Beast,
Or change him into one of thy sheep.
Be not hasty to be angry, because anger will rest in the bosom of a fool.

What reason have you to be in Choler?
Does God bear with nothing from you?
Do not you make others suffer?
Have not you deserved Hell?
Were not you to burn in the flames thereof?
Why do you then find it strange,
That your will is a little crossed?
What wrong is don you?
Do not your goods belong to God?
Cannot he take them back again?
Cannot he recall them
When he pleases, and by whom he pleases?
Who can take a hair from you, unless he will?
What Mercy willtyou obtain of God,
If you use none toward your Neighbor?
O My God!
I confess that I am in the wrong to be choleric,

As I have deserved.
They have reason to offend me,
Since I have so much offended you.

Great Trees grow up from a little Kernel.

Great actions content men:
Small actions content God.
He that is unfaithful in small things,
Will be unfaithful in great ones.
He that is faithful in small things,
Will be faithful in great ones.
Nothing is little, on which our Salvation depends.
All that is esteemed by God is great.

But God considers the heart.
Fidelity is a virtue, that makes all things great,
That it gives life to.
Do you do, what you know how to do,
And God will teach you that,
Which you know not how to do.
Do you do what you are able to do,
And God will help you to do,
VVhac you are not able to do.

Since I cannot do you any great service,
At least I will render you small ones.
Since I dare not under take hard things,

Much is required of him that receives much.
It Is to do ill, not to do good.
Sterility, is a kind of iniquity.
The fruitless Fig Tree is cast into the fire.
The Talent is taken from him that buried it.
Faith either faves, or damns us.
It makes us better, or worse.
To believe what is good, and do evil,
Is to be judged before being judged.
It Is to be condemned, before being accused.
He that does not do, what he believes,
Soon ceases to believe, what he does not.
Faith does not live long,
After the decease of Charity.
Do therefore good works.

The poor man depends upon the rich man
For this present time.

Without the poor man,
The rich man would die spiritually.
The rich man, is the poor man's Judge upon Earth.
The poor man, will be the rich man's Judge in Heaven.
Favors and Punishments are in the poor man's hands.
When he requires mercy,
God grants it to the rich man.
When he requires justice,
God executes it on the rich man.
The rich man's Salvation is lost,
That has not the favor of the poor.
One cannot defend him before God,
Whom the hunger of the poor shall accuse.
He will have an ill day of it,
Who has not their favor at the last day.
Do good to the poor man,
For he is a man as you are,
And you are in misery as he is.
He has need of you,
And you have need of him.
It Is JESUS that will receive your alms.

As long as you relieve the Poor.
You will never want any thing,
As long as you never suffer the poor to want.

He is the poor man's security.
He obliges himself by contract.
He promises you good things at present.
He promises you the goods of Eternity.
Will you not trust God?
Is your money ill placed?
Has he not wherewithal to pay you?
O JESUS! How tenderly do you love the poor?
Since you chose their condition:
Since you were poor upon Earth,
And that you will be so yet in Heaven.
You are indeed rich there above;
But you are also poor withal here below,
Since you are so in the person of the poor,
And that you beg an Alms with them.
Happy is that rich man,
Who gives an Alms to JESUS.
Accursed is that rich man,
Who refuses an Alms to JESUS.
He will beg an Alms of him at his death,
And it will not be granted him.
He will beg a grace at the day of Judgment,
And it will be refused him.

I know not what way to take to go to you.

Thinking to go up to Heaven,
I may possibly go down to Hell.
Is it through Prosperity, or through Adversity?
Is it through Peace, or through War?
Through Glory, or through Confusion?
Through Abundance, or through Poverty?
Through Health, or through Sickness?
That I must seek you, and that you will save me?
Only you alone know it.
I will therefore nothing, but what you will.
I leave my self to your Providence.
I accept of all that you order concerning me.
I will go which way soever you lead me.
I will receive all whatever you send me.
I will always like to be where you put me.

Will he have me be in this state?
Shall I perform it as he would have me?
O my God!
How I dread to deviat from your ways!
What a pleasure I have
In leaving my self to your Providence!
Is it not to be in Heaven, to be with you?
To be in Hell, to be removed from you?
Can one be ill, being where you would have him to be?
Suffer me not, O my God,
To stray away from your Conduct.
Bring me back, if I be gone aside.
Make me re-enter into the order of your goodness,
By the severe orders of your justice.
Make me repair by patience,
The defect of my action.

I love when I am in comfort.
This is the way of the Senses.
I believe, what I do not see.
I hope for, what I cannot compass.
I love, that which does not please me.
I believe, when I am in darkness.
I hope, even in my dereliction.
I love, even in my desolation.
This is the way of the Spirit.
O my God! How sensual is my Devotion?
I have not yet adored you in Spirit.
O happy State!
Where the Soul sees God without light:
Where she hopes in God without support:
Loves God without any sensible attract.
This is to see God without species.
To be united to God without a medium.
To suffer divine impressions.
To have no more proper subsistence.
To lead a supernatural life.
This is the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.

LXXIX. MED. Of Silence.
HOw fine a Science is it to know how to speak?
You will never learn it,
Unless you know how to hold your tongue.
To speak well, and speak much,
Are two things, which agree not together.
All the World learn how to speak,
Few there are that learn to keep Silence.
And notwithstanding the first of Sciences,
Is to learn how to keep Silence.
Where there are many words,
There is not much sense.
A Wise man speaks but little,
Because he is afraid of speaking ill.
He speaks a long time to himself,
Before he speaks to others.
A Fool is always talking,
Because he thinks of nothing but talking.
He pours himself all out,
Because he knows not how to dwell at home:
God kept Silence for a whole Eternity.
He made himself heard by Men,
Only for to instruct and save them.
Keep Silence as God does.
Never speak but through necessity.
A Soul that is full of God,
Cannot any more speak to men.
He that speaks much to men,
Shows that he is void of God.
For to become perfect in a short time,
You need only know how to be silent.
He that is Master of his Tongue,
Is Master of his Passions.
Solitude and Silence are the two Schools of Virtue.
There it is that God makes himself known.
There it is that he speaks to the heart.
Silence produces Prayer,
And Prayer produces Silence.
After that Moses had spoken to God,
He could not speak to men.
He that comforts himself exteriourly,
Finds but little comfort within.
The Holy Ghost loves silence.
His voice is like a gentle Zephyre,
One cannot hear it, if there be never so little noise.
Never quit Silence, but for something that is better.
One cannot without grace speak well.
And can you hope for it, when you speak
In a time that God forbids you to speak?
Every one speaks of that which he loves.
The Tongue is the Heart's interpreter.
He that loves the World,
Willingly talks of the World.
He that loves God, delights to talk of God.
You may know a man by his tongue:
And man shall be judged by his tongue.
My God! give me thy love,
That I may willingly speak of thee.
Fill me with thy presence,
That I may love Silence.
I shall never be a man of reason,
Whilst I love conversation.
Speak but little: speak low: without passion.
Never speak, but in necessity.
Never speak against Charity.
Speak with sincerity: simplicity: without
Affectation: vanity: when you ought to speak:
Keep Silence when you ought to keep it.
If any one offends not in word, he is a perfect man. Jam 1.

If any one thinks himself to be Religious, not bridling his tongue, his
religion is vain. ibid.

Since thou have spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment, and slowness of
tongue. Exodus 4.

The heart of fools is in their mouth, and the mouth of the wise is in their
heart. Eccl. 21.

Let every man be quick to hear, but slow to speak. Jam. 1.

LXXX. MED. Of Sickness.
GOD sends us Sicknesses,
Either to draw his glory out of them,
As to the man that was born blind.
Or to punish our sins, as to the Paralytick:
Or for to try us, as to Job:
Or for to keep us in Humility,
As to S. Paul, and to Timothy.
I am not able to do any thing: but I can suffer.
I can do much, if I can suffer much.
Others labor for me: I suffer for others.
They honor God by their Actions:
I honor him by my Sufferings.
I have well deserved what I suffer.
I merit much by suffering.
I acquit for what is past.
I heap up for the time to com:
God takes my health from me,
For to give me sanctity.
He is with me: I suffer with him.
I carry his Cross: He carries mine.
How strong is my Spirit,
When my Body is weak?
How weak is my Spirit,
When my Body is strong?
Sickness gives me a disgust to life.
My heart aspires no more, but for Heaven.
O my Body! Thou must be punished,
And have thy Purgatory, as well as the Soul.
Unless thou have it here upon Earth,
Thou must have it in Hell:
For nothing that is impure,
Shall enter into Heaven.
There are but these two places,
That thou can have it in.
Rejoice, O my Soul! for thy Enemy is low.
He is no more in a condition to hurt thee.
O my God!
I deserve indeed to be sick,
Since I have so much abused my health.
O how much am I indebted to you,
For having thus afflicted me?
Since you spare me not at present,
You will spare me in Eternity.
Since you chastize me during my life,
You will be gracious to me after death.
O how glad am I to make of my Body
A Victim of Love and Sufferance!
There is no Sacrifice more pleasing
To your Eyes, than that of Patience.
Son in thy Sickness despise not thy self, but pray to God, and he will cure
thee. Eccl. 38.

Behold, thou art now healed, sin no more, least something worse do befall thee.
Jo. 5.

This sickness is not to death, but to the glory of God. Jo. 11.

When I am weak, then am I strong. 2 Cor. 12.

LXXXI. MED. Of Modesty.
A Man is known by his Countenance.
A Soul is known by her Body.
It Is a Looking-glass which represents her,
And wherein she is painted to the life.
A light Body shows a light Soul.
A modest Body shows a modest Soul.
It does nothing, but what it is made to do.
When the Body is out of order,
It Is judged that the Soul is so too.
What figure must that Soul have,
Which gives so ill an one to her Body.
A quiet and modest Exterior,
Is the mark of a perfect Soul.
Of a Soul that tends to Union.
Of a Soul that is without passion.
God is a tranquil Spirit: He is never disturbed:
He dwells only in Peace:
He composes and quiets all things by his presence.
He imprints his Modesty on that Soul,
That he gives life to.
And if he does not imprint it,
It Is because the Soul does not obey him.
When I see a Modest Body, I say,
O here is the House of God!
Here is the Temple of our Lord!
All things are here in peace and in order.
It Is the Modesty of this Soul,
That reflects upon her Body.
It Is the Sanctity within,
That sheds it self without.
An affected Modesty cannot last long.
When the Soul is well composed,
The Body is modest at all times.
The gestures of an ill regulated Body,
Com from the irregularity of the Soul.
She is agitated with Passions.
She gives ear to Temptations.
She sinks under her pains.
She gives her self up to her desires.
He that has God within himself,
Goes not elsewhere to seek him.
The Iron is at rest,
When it touches its Lodestone.
A Soul which touches God,
Is peaceable, and without motion.
O My God!
How tranquil is thy Spirit?
O how agitated is mine?
How grave is yours?
How light is mine?
How Modest is yours?
How unruly is mine?
If you were Master of my Heart,
You would also be Master of my Body.
If I quit the Outworks,
The Devil will gain the place.
I will therefore regulate my exterior,
That I may conserve for you the Empire of my heart.
A man is known by the sight, and a wise man is known by the show of his face.
The clothing of the body, and the laughing of the teeth, and the gate of the
man, tell of him. Eccl. 19.

Let your Modesty be known unto all men. Phil. 4.

The man of the heart that is hidden in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a
modest spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. 1 Pet. 3.

I beseech you by the modesty and meekness of Christ. 2 Cor. 10.

Do you on like the Elect of God, Humility, Modesty, Patience. Col. 3.

LXXXII. MED. Of Divine Inspirations.
GOD holds his peace after he has spoken.
He scorns after having been scorned.
He hides himself after that he has sought.
He withdraws after he has called,
He punishes after having long endured.
Inspiration is the Voice of God.
It Is a Blast of his Spirit.
It Is a Ray of his Wisdom.
It Is an Impression of his Love.
It Is the Seed of Eternity.
It Is the Principle of Salvation.
It Is the price of the Blood of Jesus.
It Is a Grace, that has cost him his life.
You stifle the voice of God,
When you stifle an Inspiration.
You imitate Herod,
Who put St. John to death.
You imitate Saul,
Who put the Priests to death.
You imitate the Jews,
Who put JESUS, and the Prophets to death.
You resist the Holy Ghost.
You sin without ignorance.
You sin through obstinacy: through malice.
You bury the Talents of God.

You trample the Son of God under your feet.
You do an injury to his Spirit.
You profane his precious Blood.
You detain Truth Captive.
You break off the thread of his Graces.
You put your Salvation in danger.
The Justice of God will break out upon you.
Your Talents will be taken from you.
The Kingdom of Grace will be translated elsewhere.
God will speak no more to you.
The Holy Ghost will breath no more on you.
The Word of God will touch you no more.
Your Conscience will no longer molest you.
Hope will no longer encourage you.
Charity will no longer warm you.
Fear will no longer retain you.
Remedies will no longer profit you.
You abuse extraordinary Graces.
You will have them no more.
O my God! I confess that I am a Prodigal,
Who have wasted all your goods.
That I am a Herod,
Who have put your Voice to death.
O I will make you wait no longer!
I will no longer resist your grace.
You have too long knocked at the door of my heart.
This very day I will let you in.
You would have me quit this sin;
I will quit it.
You would have me change my life;
I will change it.
You would have me renounce gaming;
I will renounce it.
You would have me speak to my Enemy;
I will speak to him.
You would have me frequent the Sacraments;
I will frequent them.
You would have me love you alone;
I will love you: in Time, and Eternity. Amen.
Woe to thee that despisest, shall not thy self also be despised? Isai. 33.

I called and you refused: I extended my hand, and there was none that
regarded. Ye despised all my counsel, and ye neglected my rebukes: and I will
laugh in your destruction. Prove. 1.

I go, and you will seek me, and you will die in your Sin. Jo. 8.

Extinguish not the spirit. These. 5.

This day if you hear his voice, etc. Ps. 44.

LXXXIII. MED. Of the Word of God.
GOD created the World by his Word,
And he will not save it but by his Word.
He redeemed it by his Word Incarnate,
Nor will he save it but by his Word Incarnate.
The Holy Ghost is produced in the heart of God,
By his Interior Word.
The Holy Ghost is not produced in the heart of Man,
But by the Exterior Word.
You are not a Sheep of JESUS Christ's,
Unless you hearken to his voice.
Your heart will bring forth nothing but Thorns,
Unless it receive this Divine seed.
JESUS speaks by the mouth of the Preacher.
It Is he that rings in his Tongue,
He is clothed with the sound of his Voice,
As he came forth-cloath'd with a body of Flesh,
The Word written in Books,
Is a Sacrament of Salvation.
The Letter is the Species: JESUS is the Sense.
The Increated Word,
Unites it self to the Word created,
That he may enter into hearts, and sanctify them.
What an Impiety to despise this Sacrament?
What a Crime to trample on the Son of God?
Alas! How often have I don it?
I let it fall down on the ground.
I stifle it in my heart.
I eat this heavenly bread,
And I do not profit by it.
I hear this Divine Word, and I am not converted.
If it does not convert me, it will pervert me.
If it does me no good, it will do me hurt.
If it give not life to me, it will be my death.
If it does not save me, it will damn me.
Blessed is the womb that bore thee, etc. Yea, blessed are those, who hear the
Word of God and keep it. Luk 11.

He that turns away his ear, that he may not hear the Law, his Prayer shall be
execrable. Isai. 28.

Not in bread alone shall man live, but in every word that proceeds from the
mouth of God. Matthew. 4.

See that you refuse him not speaking. Heb. 11.

The seed is the Word of God. Luke 8.

LXXXIV. MED. Of the Happiness of a Religious State.
REligion is a Paradise.
God is always seen there.
His Voice is always heard there.
One is always in his Presence there.
One enjoys always his Company there.
One always does his Will there.
One always sings his Praises there.
There one falls seldom: Commits but light sins:
Rises soon: Merits continually:
Dies quietly, and is saved securely.
O how heavy is the Yoke of the World!
O how troublesome are its Crosses!
O how bitter is its Chalice!
O how pricking are its thorns!
O how pestilent are its Examples!
O how dangerous are its Conversations!
O how Tyrannical are its Laws!
O how pernicious are its Maxims!
O how shameful are its Pleasures!
O how imaginary are its Goods!
Cursed Onions of Egypt!
You draw Tears from those that eat you:
You make those weep that love you.
He took away his people like sheep, and brought them through like a flock in
the desert. Ps. 77.

They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of
the afflicter. ibid.

How beloved are thy tabernacles, O Lord, my Soul does long and faint into the
courts of our Lord? Ps. 89.

I have chosen to be abject in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the
tabernacles of Sinners.

Better is one day in thy courts above a thousand. ibid.

Every one who shall leave his house, or Brothers, or Sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife or children, or land, for my sake, shall receive a hundred
fold, and possess life everlasting. Matthew. 19.

Amen, I say unto you, That there is none, etc. who shall not receive now in
this time a hundred fold with Persecutions, and in the World to com life
everlasting. Mark. 10.

Much more in this time, etc. Luke 18.

LXXXV. MED. Of Poverty.
ONe that is Poor in spirit,
Busies himself with nothing.
One that is Poor in heart, desires nothing.
He contents himself with what is necessary.
Nay, he is willing to want even Necessaries.
Few things are wanting
To a Poor man that is contented.
All things are wanting to a rich Miser.
Few things suffice Necessity.
Nothing is sufficient to Covetousness.
How rich is that man who possesses God?
How poor is that man who has lost God?
How happy is that man,
Who will have nothing but God?
How covetous is that man,
Who is not contented with God?
God fills an empty heart.
All is established in Nothing.
You shall have All, if you desire Nothing.
You will find All, when you have Nothing.
O my Savior!
How rich an inheritance is Poverty?
What good do you to those that have quitted all?
Could any one be poorer, Than you were born?
Could any one live poorer, than you lived?
You were rich, and you made your self poor.
I am poor, and I would fain become rich.
You had all, and yet you wanted all.
I had nothing, and I would want nothing.
O how unjust a thing is it, that the Slave
Should be better accomodated than his Master!
Fear not my Son, we lead indeed a poor life, but we shall have many goods,
if we fear God. Tob. 4.

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Matthew. 5.

If thou vvilt be perfect, go and sell all thou have, and give it to the poor.

We brought nothing into this World, nor doubtless shall we carry any thing
away. 1 Timothy 6.

LXXXVI. MED. Of Chastity.
JESUS loves those that are Virgins.
JESUS chose a Virgin Mother.
JESUS cherished a Virgin-Disciple.
JESUS in Heaven is followed by Virgins.
I am more than an Angel, if I am a Virgin.
I resemble God, if I am a Virgin.
I am the Spouse of Christ, if, etc.
I am the Handmaid of Christ, if, etc.
I shall have a Garland in Heaven, if, etc.
I shall have more right to Resurrection, if, etc.
Virginity is a great treasure,
But hard to preserve.
One must be humble to be chaste.
God humbles the Proud.
He lets them fall into infamous Sins.
He punishes the Soul by the Body.
He covers those with shame and confusion,
Who have not Submission.
No man can command,
Who knows not how to obey.
No man can be a Master,
If he never learnt to be subject.
The Body obeys an obedient Spirit.
It is submiss to a submiss Spirit.
It is rebellious to a rebellious Spirit.
He that does not obey his Superior,
Loses his empire over his Inferior.
He that does not mortify his senses,
Becoms a slave to his Body.
Watch over your self, and Pray.
Fly occasions, or else you will perish.
O my God! How I dread Pride,
Since it casts one into impurity!
How I love Obedience,
Since it conserves Innocence?
I will be very humble, that I may be very chaste.
I will obey my Superiors,
That I may be obeyed by my Inferiors.
O let me rather fall into Hell,
Than let me fall into Impurity!
The Disciple whom Jesus loved. Jo. 21.

These are they who were not stained with women, for they are Virgins. Apoc. 14.

Incorruption makes one near unto God. Wisd. 6.

In the Resurrection they shall neither marry, nor be married; but they shall
be like the Angels of God in Heaven. Matthew. 22.

Therefore God delivered them up to the desires of their hearts; into
uncleanness for to abuse their own bodies among themselves ignominiously. Romans
1.

Therefore God has delivered them into passions of ignominy. ibid.

LXXXVII. MED. Of Obedience.
HOw happy is an obedient man?
He always does what God would have him.
He is in some manner impeccable.
He possesses all Virtues.
He is victorious over all Vices.
How miserable is a rebellious Subject?
How wicked and vicious is he?
He labors much, and gains nothing.
He is strongly tempted,
And he yields to the Temptation.
He fights against the Will of God,
And God fights against his.
He goes out of the order of his goodness,
And he enters into that of his justice.
He will not bow,
And God breaks his Obstinacy.
He will not obey,
And God opposes his Inclination.
He loses the command he had over his Body,
From the time that he will not submit his Spirit.
He is not obeyed by his Inferiors,
Because he obeys not his Superiors.
O Christian and Religious Soul!
Acknowledge and adore Jesus in all his Images.
In those of Wood and Earth,
As well as in those of Gold and Silver.
Receive with respect God's orders.
By the Organ of Amos, as well as that of Isaiah.
By the mouth of a Peasant,
As well as of a Courtier.
Obey all your Superiors.
Obey them in all that is not sin.
Obey them with all your Heart.
Obey them with all your Spirit.
Obey them voluntarily.
Obey them blindly.
Imitate Jesus, obedient even unto death:
Lose your life rather, as he did,
Than lose your obedience.
Would God have Holocausts and Victims: and not rather to be obeyed? Better is
Obedience than Victims. 1 Kings. 15.

It is, as it were, the sin of enchantment to resist, and as it were, the
wickedness of Idolatry to refuse to obey. ibid.

The obedient man shall speak Victories. Prove. 21.

He that resists power, resists God's order. Romans 13.

Obey your Prelates, and be subject to them: for they watch, as being to render
an account for your Souls, that they may do it with joy, and not mourning. Heb.
13.

LXXXVIII. MED. Of Religious Discipline.
IF Religion is a Building,
The Rules are the Foundation thereof.
If Religion is a Body,
The Rules are the Sinews thereof.
If Religion is a Fortress,
The Rules are the Walls thereof.
If Religion is a Holy Place,
The Rules are its Enclosure.
You are no Religious man,
If you do not keep your Rules.
If you keep them by halfs,
You are a Religious man by hafls.
Or rather you are not at all.
As it is not to be a true Christian,
Not to be a believer in all.
If you do not observe your Rules,
You will never be perfect.
Blood runs through the veins,
And Graces through the Rules.
Look how many of them you transgress,
So many Graces do you lose.
One cannot, without danger of life,
Out the Conduit-pipes of life.
Without the Rules of Religion,
One cannot arrive to perfection.
Observe the Laws of Nature,
And you will be a perfect man.
Observe the Laws of Grace,
And you will be a perfect Christian.
Observe the Laws of your Order,
And you will be a perfect Religious man.
There is no Rule be it never so small;
Which has not Graces of Salvation:
Which has not all the authority of God:
Which has not the ty of his power:
Which has not the seal of his goodness:
Which has not the Character of his Sanctity;
If you do not observe your Rules,
Your Virtues are Illusions.
Your Devotions are irregular.
They are great steps out of the good way.
You draw off from perfection,
Instead of drawing near to it.
The Spirit of Singularity,
Is the beginning of Heresies.
It Is the Plague of Religion.
It Is the Enemy of Humility.
It Is the ruin of Communities.
Its Devotion is Schismatical.
Its Separation is Heretical.
Its Sentiments are presumptuous.
Its Examples are scandalous.
He that is not in order,
Is ill treated by the Prince of order.
He that separates himself from the Community,
Loses the graces of the Community.
Unless you be a member of the body,
You will have no part in the life thereof.
The members are united by the Rules.
If you cut off the ligaments of graces,
You must be reckoned among the dead.
Unless you live in order,
You will never live in peace.
Your Rules are the Outworks,
Which cover and defend you.
If you quit these defenses,
You run a hazard of being lost.
Without the grace of vocation,
One cannot live in Religion.
This grace is tied to the Rules.
It runs through these Channels.
Whoever breaks this commerce,
Does draw on himself an infinity of evils.
That which you break is small,
But the damage thereof is considerable.
These light unfaithfulnesses
Dispose you unto greater.
He that is not faithful in small matters,
Will not be faithful in great ones.
How will you do hard matters,
If you do not do easy things?
A breach, be it never so little,
Breaks the Religious Enclosure.
This small irregularity will produce a greater:
It will breed great temptations:
It will give an entrance to the Devil.
This Rule, say you, is small;
It is therefore easy to be observed.
You do ill therefore in breaking it.
It has cost many a tear to him that made it.
A grace ought to be esteemd,
That cost him dear that made it.
One sparkle kindles a great fire.
A Fort is taken by a small breach.
A small cranny is enough to sink a Ship.
Every thing in the service of God, is great.
His Will heightens all that it orders.
It Is he that made these Rules.
It Is he that intimates these Laws to you.
They all have his hand and seal.
They all mark his authority.
He conducts every Being to its end.
He pushes on all Creatures to their center.
The Inanimate by their weight.
The Rational by his Laws.
If you keep order, it will keep you.
If you disturb it, it will disturb you.
If you destroy it, it will destroy you.
O Christian, and Religious Soul!
Do not disturb the peace of your Sisters.
Do not undermine the foundations of your Order.
Do not ruin the prop of Religion.
Do not lose the grace of your Vocation.
Do not rend the Breasts of your Mother.
Do not afflict your Father's heart.
His Spirit is in his Rules.
You offend him, when you break them.
You slight him, when you neglect them.
You treat him as imprudent,
Since you reject his conduct.
You make him pass for a Tyrant,
Who commands you things impossible.
Did you com into Religion,
For to live without Order, and without Religion?
The Laws do preserve States:
The Rules maintain Communities.
To break one through contempt,
Is a sin of consequence.
Can one transgress it often and freely,
Without slighting it?
Can one desire perfection, not being willing
To rid ones self of one imperfection?
O my God!
How culpable am I,
In doing ill in the Land of the Saints?
I wear the Habit of a Religious man,
But I have not the spirit of one.
I dwell in a sacred place,
With a profane Heart and Spirit.
I am the Plague of my Order.
The reproach of my Religion.
The scandal of my Brothers.
A grief to my Mother.
(...) Founder.
(...) his Law.
A man without Discipline.
A Religious man without Religion.
O good Shepherd run after me.
Bring back your strayed Sheep.
Make her re-enter into the Fold.
If the Wolf finds her alone
He will devour her.
O I will henceforth follow you!
I will obey your Laws.
I will perform all my Duties.
I will henceforth live in order.
To have Rules, and not to keep them,
Is to seem to be a Religious man,
And not to be one.
Keep the Law and Counsel, and there shall be (...) thy Soul. Prove. 3.

If you love me, keep my Commandments. Jo. 14.

He that is faithful in a small matter, will be fait^ a greater. Luke 16.

He that slights small things will fall, etc. Eccl. 19.

They afflicted the spirit of the holy one. Is. 63.

Odious unto all, as an Outlaw; and execrable, as enemy to his country and
citizens. 2 Macch. 5.

Great are thy judgments, O Lord, and unutterable a thy words. For this,
undisciplined couls have gone astray. Wisd. 17.

We must therefore believe it.

We must therefore do it.
His Doctrine is the Rule of our Faith.
His Example is the Rule of our Manners.
He is infallible in his words.
He is impeccable in his actions.
I am an Heretic in my Spirit,
If I do not believe what he has said.
I am an Heretic in heart

I shall be perfect, if I am like unto Jesus.
I shall be cherished by God, if I am like unto Jesus.
I shall love God, if I am like unto Jesus.
I shall be saved, if I am like unto Jesus.
O what a happiness! to be like unto God.
To live like God. To speak like God.
To act, to suffer, and to die like a God.
Was it thus that Jesus spoke?
Was it thus that JESUS acted?
Was it thus that JESUS suffered?
My Brethren put on Jesus Christ
As a Garment which covers Body and Soul.
Look on, and make it according to the pattern that was showed thee in the
Mount. Exodus 25.

8.

He that says that he remains in him, ought as he walked, to walk also. 1 John.

XC. MED. Of the Virtue, of Jesus compared to our Vices.
JESUS was poor: and I am rich.
JESUS was humble: and I am proud.
JESUS was mild: and I am choleric.
JESUS was patient: and I will endure nothing.
Jesus did pardon: and I will revenge my self.
Jesus obeyed: and I will command.
Jesus was hated: and I would be beloved.
Jesus was slighted: and I would be honored.
Jesus lay hid: and I would appear.
Jesus ascended into Heaven by pain:
And I would ascend through Pleasure.
Is it just, that the Slave
Should be better treated than the Child?
And the Criminal than the Innocent?
O how I fear to be reprobated,
Being so little like to the first of the Predestinate!
Is thy heart upright as mine is? 4 Kings. 10.

The Disciple is not above his Master, nor the Servant above his Lord. Matthew.
10.

He is made unto us Wisdom from God, and Justice, and Sanctification, and
Redemption. 1 Cor. 2.

I am the way, the truth and the life. Jo. 14.

XCI. MED. Of the Nativity of JESUS Christ.
NEver did God show himself greater,
Than when he made himself little.
Never more powerful,
Than when he made himself weak.
Never more amiable,
Than when he made himself miserable.
When I see God become the Son of man,
I know that man may become the Son of God.
When I see him in a stable,
I know that we ought to humble our selves.
When I see him on the straw,
I know that the grandures of the World
Are nothing but dung.
When I see him weep,
I know that we must suffer.
All the Wisdom of God
Is included in this Child.
All his Actions are Rules of Wisdom.
His Stable is the School of Wisdom.
His Crib is the Throne of Wisdom.
His Silence is the Voice of Wisdom.
His Sleep is the Ecstasy of Wisdom.
Either Jesus is deceived,
Or the World is mistaken.
Which of the two will you believe?
The Birth of Jesus is the Reprobation of the World.
He has condemned all that he has rejected.
Unless I am like unto this Child,
I shall never be saved.
I Evangelize unto you great joy, etc. Luke 1.

She swathed him in clouts, and laid him down in a manger. ibid.

A child is born to us, and a Son is given to us. Is. 9.

Let us go over to Bethlehem, and see this Word that is don. Luke 2.

The Word was made flesh. John. 1.

XCII. MED. Affections of tenderness toward the Infant Jesus.
O God of Wisdom! who have chosen a Stable
For the Palace of thy greatness!
Who have chosen a Crib for thy Throne of glory!
Where shall I hide my self in thy Presence?
What a confusion is it to a Proud man
To see a God on a Dunghill?
What insolence is it for a worm of the Earth,
To be yet desirous to raise himself?
Is it You, or the World that is mistaken?
Can the Wisdom of God be deceived?
O God of Goodness!
How have you hid your Greatness?
But how have you made your Mercy to shine?
You never rendered your self more amiable,
Than when you made your self miserable.
You never appeared greater in goodness,
Than when you annihilated your Majesty.
I did dread you heretofore as you were God:
But I am forced to love you as you are Man.
Who can be apprehensive of an Infant?
Who is not melted by the tears of an Infant?
Your weeping moves compassion, but not fear.
It gives me hopes, but not a diffidence.
If you could make your Son the Son of Man,
Cannot you make me the Son of God?
If you could make your self miscrable,
Cannot you make me happy?
O divine Babe! O the love of all Ages!
O the fairest of Men! O the desires of Heaven!
When I hear you groan and sigh,
I cannot hinder my self from loving you.
I have a long time resisted your power.
I yield now unto your weakness.
I have slighted your greatness,
But I submit my self to your humility.
I have fought against you as you were God,
But you triumph over my heart as you are Man.
I defended my self against your wrath,
But I cannot resist your love.
O the greatest of all Kings!
How does your Majesty astonish me?
But how does your Humility ravish me?
How wonderful are you as you are God?
But how lovely are you as you are Man?
I am more surprised to see you humbled,
Than to see you elevated:
To hear you cry, than to hear you thunder.
One only Tear of yours stirs up in my heart
A greater fire of love, than all the fires of Sinai.
O since you have taken on you my Miseries,
I hope you will give me your goods.
Since you are com down upon Earth,
I hope that you will raise me up to Heaven.
O dear Son of Mary!
Com into my arms.
Repose your self on my heart.
Water me with your tears.
Warm me with your love.
Bless me with your little hands.
Kiss me with your little mouth.
I forget what I am,
Since you forget what you are.
If I fail in the respects that I owe you,
It Is your love that is the cause thereof.
Make your self less amiable,
If you will not be beloved.
When I shall see you on a Throne,
I shall be seized with fright.
But when I consider you in a Crib,
I shall love you with all my heart.
I shall approach you without fear.
I shall love you without diffidence.
I shall serve you without disgust.
I shall give you all without reserve.
I shall bless you without respit.
I shall praise and bless you without end,
Both in Time, and Eternity. Amen.
XCIII. MED. Of the Poverty of the Infant Jesus.
JEsus made himself poor, to enrich us.
Jesus stripped himself, to cloth us.
Jesus came down on a Dunghill,
For to raise us up to a Throne.
Jesus contemned riches,
To teach us to contemn them.
Compare, O Worldling,
Thy house to his Stable.
Thy bed to his Crib.
Thy done, to his Dunghill.
Thy clothes to his Swath-bands.
Thy riot to his Nakedness.
Jesus is poor: And thou art rich.
Jesus in a Stable: Thou in a Palace.
Jesus on the straw: Thou on a doon-bed.
Jesus is all naked: Thou art well clad.
Jesus wants all things: Thou nothing.
O divine Babe!
How does your Birth rejoice me?
But how does your Poverty afflict me?
How does your Infancy comfort me?
But how does your Crib astonish me?
I will love the Poor, since I cannot love Poverty.
I will relieve the Poor,
That I may relieve your necessity.
I will cloth the Poor,
That I may cover your nakedness.
I shall not be saved, unless I be like unto you.
I must be poor as you are;
Or you must be rich as I am.
If therefore I will not be poor as you are,
I must make you rich as I am.
It Is to do good to you to do it to the poor.
I will therefore relieve you
In the person of the poor.
I will feed you, lodge, and cloth you, in, etc.
O I think my self happy,
That I can render back to you
What you have given me!
That I can help you out of your necessity.
That I can cloth, feed, and lodge you.
The foxes have their holes, and the Birds of the air their nests: but the Son
of Man has not where to lay his head. Matthew. 8.

brothers, you have don to me. Matthew. 15.

Cor. 8.

XCIV. MED. Of the Humility of the Infant Jesus.
GOD did annihilate himself,
By uniting himself to nothing.
He has humbled all his whole greatness.
He has made himself as little as he was great.
He debased himself as much as he was elevated.
His humiliation is infinite: substantial: eternal.
As long as he keeps his humanity,
He will keep the marks of his humility.
Why was he made man?
Why was he made passible and mortal?
Why did he take our flesh?
Why was he made an Infant?
Why would he be born of a Woman?
Why would he lodge in a Stable?
It Is to pull down our pride;
For to teach us humility:
For to win our hearts:
For to be more like us.
O Divine Babe!
How great are you in Heaven?
But, how little are you on Earth?
How are you honored by the Angels?
But how are you despised by men?
How do I respect you in the form of God?
But how I love you in the form of an Infant?
It Is an astonishing thing,
To see a God humbled.
But much more astonishing,
To see a Man elevated.
O how am I confounded,
To be proud before an humbled God.
Whosoever shall humble himself like this little one, he is the greatest in the
Kingdom of Heaven. Matthew. 18.

Behold God is my Savior, I will do confidently, and will not fear. Isai. 12.

He exinanited himself, taking the form of a Servant. Phil. 2.

XCV. MED. Of the Divine Humiliations in the Mystery of the Incarnation.
THe Word was God, and he became Man.
The Word was happy,
And he became miserable.
The Word was holy,
And he took the form of a sinner.
He became man,
For to communicate his Divinity to us.
He became miserable,
For to communicate his felicity to us.
He appeared to be a sinner,
For to communicate his sanctity to us.
O Jesus, annihilated under the form of Man!
Of a Sinner: of a Wretch:
O the greatest, and the least!
O the first, and the last!
O the highest, and the lowest*
My Soul!
Will thou be proud,
Seeing thy God annihilated*
Would thou appear to be a Saint,
Contemplating thy God under the form of a Sinner?
Would thou live in pleasures,
Seeing thy God in misery?
O Nothing!
VVilt thou never annihilate thy self?
VVilt thou never be in thy proper place?
What good have thou don?
What ill have thou not don?
Whence did thou com?
Whether art thou to go?
It Is an unsupportable pride
For man to grow proud,
When he sees his God humbled.
The Word was made flesh. John. 1.

He exinanited himself, taking the form of a servant. Phil. 2.

God sending his Son into the similitude of the flesh of sin. Romans 8.

Him who knew not sin, he made him a sin for us, that we might be made the

XCVI. MED. Of the Holy Name of Jesus.
JESUS is a name of greatness, sweetness, valor.
Of greatness: which signifies the God of men.
Of sweetness: which signifies the Father of men.
Of valor: which signifies the Savior of men.
His greatness, makes him to be adored in Heaven.
His sweetness, makes him be beloved on Earth.
His valor, makes him be feared in Hell.
When I pronounce the Name of JESUS,
I represent to my self the greatest of all Kings.
The most charitable of all Fathers.
The most valiant of all Warriors.
The most humble of all Men.
The most faithful of all Friends.
The mildest of all Masters.
The most obliging of all hearts.
The most amiable of all Espouses.
When I pronounce JESUS,
My sadness is dissipated.
My courage is raised.
My heart displays it self. My spirit awakens.
My soul melts into joy.
All my Enemies fly away.
If Jesus is my Savior, cannot he save me?
Ought he not to save me?
He is charged with my Salvation.
He has accepted the commission of it.
He makes it his business.
He will spare nothing for that end.
It will cost him his life.
What can I fear having a Savior?
What ought not I to hope for,
Having such a Savior?
O JESUS! The Father of the poor.
The Comforter of the afflicted.
My Soul is speechless before you.
My heart says to you, that you are all its good.
Be unto me a JESUS in my life.
Be unto me a JESUS at my death.
If I have committed what may damn me,
You have not lost what may save me.
O JESU! Put your self as a seal upon my heart!
As a seal upon my mouth:
As a seal upon my arm.
That I may think on nothing but you,
Speak of nothing but you.
Labor only for you.
O JESU! I adore you, as a name of greatness.
I love you, as a name of sweetnese.
invocate you, as a name of valor.
I will give my blood for to be saved,
Since you gave yours for to be a Savior.
I will suffer Wounds as you did,
That with you, I may be a Savior of men.
But thou art in us, O Lord, and thy holy name is invocated on us. Jer. 14.

It shall be that every one, who invocates the name of Lord, shall be saved.
Joel. 2.

For there is no other name under Heaven given to men, in which we must be
saved. Act. 5.

In the name of Jesus let every knee bow. Phil. 2.

And yet you promise to do the will
Of those, who do yours.
O you shall henceforth be my treasure!
Since my heart, O my God, is yours.

Not to refuse any evil.
To be always contented.
To live and die on the Cross.
This is the Kingdom of Jesus.
This is that which makes his Empire.
O JESUS my King!
I am your servant, and the Son of your handmaid.
Alas! How can you enter into a heart,
From whence I have so often driven you?
It Is a long time since you have not lived in me.
Since I have been in your grace.
Since you reign not in me.
Since you reign not in me in peace.
Re-enter, O Lord, into your Kingdom,
And never go out of it any more.
Defend your self in it,
Against the enemies of your Crown.
Satan says, that he is my Master.
The World says, that I am his Slave.
Pride says, that I belong to him.
Sensuality says, that I am hers.
And I say, that I belong to Jesus.
That I am redeemed with the blood of JESUS.
That I have no other Master but Jesus.
That I will die in the Service of Jesus.
That nothing shall separate me from Jesus.
Behold your King. John. 19.

My Kingdom is not of this World. ibid.

Do thou and thy Son rule over us. Judge. 8.

Let not Sin therefore reign in your mortal body. Romans 6.

The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Apoc. 13.

XCIX. MED. Of the Passion of JESUS Christ in general.
JEsus is the true Son of God.
He is the holiest of all men.
He is the greatest of all Kings.
He is the best of all Friends.
He never disobliged any one.
He did good to all the World,
And all the World did ill to him.
As he suffered for all men,
So he suffered from all men.
There was no Sex, nor Condition,
Which did not contribute to his Passion.
Jews, Gentiles, Priests, and Kings
All labored to his Cross.
Jesus suffered all sorts of evils.
In his body, and in his soul.
In his spirit, and in his heart.
In his memory, and in his imagination.
In his honor, and in his goods.
In his parents, and in his friends.
In all his senses, and in all his members.
He is a man of sorrows and pain,
And I would be a man of pleasures.
Jesus is the Victim of all times.
He is the Victim of all men: just and sinners.
He is the Victim of our Crimes.
As he loaded himself with all our Crimes,
He was crowned with all our sufferings.
As there is no man, that he did not love,
So there was none that he did not suffer for.
But he principally suffered for me,
And yet I will endure nothing for him.
Who did oblige him to die for ungrateful People?
Why would he make himself miserable?
He died for to restore life to us.
He made himself miserable, to make us happy.
He delivered himself up to his Enemies.
He did not appeal from Pilate's Sentence.
He wrought no Miracle for to save himself.
He was crucified all his life long.
His Heart was crucified before his Body was.
He died with a desire to die.
His greatest sufferance was,
That he did not suffer.
O most sweet Jesus!
You ought to rest satisfied,
For you have been satiated with reproaches.
You cannot suffer more, than you have suffered.
You could not die more cruelly, than you died.
And I would live in delights.
Where shall I find Examples of your goodness?
Examples of my malice?
Examples of your love?
Examples of my ingratitude?
In him dwells all plenitude of the Divinity corporally. Col. 2.

God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and virtue, who passed along, doing good,
and healing all that were oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him. Act.
10.

Who loved me, and gave himself for me. Gal. 2.

I am to be baptized with a Baptism, and how am I straitened until it be
performed? Luke 12.

From the sole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is no health in him.
Isai. 53.

C. MED. Of the Sadness of the Son of God in the Garden of Olives.
JEsus is sad even unto Death,
At the sight of his torments:
Of my Sins: Ingratitudes: Miseries.
He was seized with fear, for to show,
That he was a man like me:
That he was weak like me:
That he stripped himself of his force,
And clothed himself with my weakness.
That he gave me his courage:
That he took my timidity.
He trembles, to give me assurance.
He fears, for to encourage me.
He falls, for to raise me up.
Pleasure and Pain, make all the Sins of men.
Desire and Fear, make all the Passions of men.
Jesus has conquered both these Enemies,
And has given us his strength for to conquer them.
He abstained from all Pleasures.
He suffered all Pains.
He renounced all Desires.
He surmounted all Fears.
He sweat Blood and Water.
He fought even unto Death.
O divine Savior!
How rough was this first encounter to you?
How bloody was this battle to you?
Alas! I was in your heart for to afflict you.
In the arms of the Jews for to torment you.
My Sins were in the World before you,
Since it were they that afflicted and crucified you.
O divine Master!
You give us excellent Examples,
But no body will imitate them.
You give us excellent Lessons,
But no body will learn them.
You go the first to the onset,
But no body will follow you.
Your Disciples have forsaken you.
They sleep during your agony.
They afflict you instead of comforting you.
They betray you instead of helping you.
What a confusion is this for me.
I yield to a human temptation,
Being supported by the force of a God.
And Jesus surmounts the temptations of the Devil,
Being clothed with the weaknesses of all men.
O precious Blood!
Which bathest an ungrateful ground:
Warm, and water my heart.
O my Redeemer!
I will henceforth imitate your courage.
I will resist even unto blood.
I will triumph over the flesh.
I will fight even unto Death.
O, I will drink of your Chalice,
Since you vouchsafed to drink mine!
He began to fear, and to be heavy. Mark. 14.

My Soul is sad even unto death: stay here, and watch. ibid.

His sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the earth. Luke 22.

He surely has born our infirmities, and our sorrows he has carried. Isai 53.

CI. MED. On the Prayer of our Lord in the Garden.
JEsus draws off from his Disciples,
And prays to his Father in his sadness.
He prays with Reverence: Perseverance:
Resignation: He prays, and is not heard.
He teaches us how to pray.
He teaches us how to resign our selves.
O the good Jesus!
He would not be heard, that we might be heard.
He obtained no favor for himself,
But he obtained favor for us.
Pray in your Afflictions. Pray alone by your self.
Pray with Humility: Resignation: Conformity.
Never be weary of Praying.
Say to God in all your fears.
Most holy and most charitable Father!
Here is a Chalice of confusion,
Which my Enemies prepare for me to drink.
Remove it, if it please you, from me:
Yet not my will be don, but thine.
Father of Mercy!
Here is a Chalice of Pain that is very bitter.
Make it, I beseech you, to pass from my mouth
Yet not my will be don, but thine.
Father of the Poor!
Here are my Goods taken away from me.
Here is a Chalice of Poverty,
Which they will make me drink.
Cannot I be dispensed from it?
Let thy will be don, and not mine.
Thus run through all your Pains.
Represent them quietly to God,
And conform you self to his Will.
Going forwards a little he fell prostrate on his face, praying. Matthew. 26.

My Father, if it be possible, let this Chalice pass from me: yet not as I
will, but as thou will. ibid.

Father, if this Chalice cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be don. ibid.

My God I will cry out by day, and thou will not hear. Ps. 21.

CII. MED. Of the Outrages that our Lord suffered in Anna 's and Caiphas 's
house.
TO give bussets to a God.
To spit in his face.
To treat him as a false Prophet.
To declare him a Blasphemer.
To judge him worthy of Death.
To condemn him as a Criminal.
O abominable Impiety!
O detestable Crime!
This is what you do when you offend God.
When you offend your Neighbor.
You strike Jesus, when you strike his Members.
You dishonor Jesus,
When you dishonor his Members.
Suffer like Jesus, the injuries spoken to you.
Suffer like Jesus, the outrages don to you.
Are you more noble than he?
Are you more innocent than he?
Are you worse treated than he?
Jesus suffers; and will you suffer nothing?
Jesus does not revenge himself; and will you?
O JESU! I deserv to be despised,
Since I have so often despised you.
I well deserv to receiv bussets,
Because I have so often busseted you.
Behold you are declared guilty:
And I would pass for innocent.
Behold you are condemned to death,
And yet I will not leav my life.
O I will die for you, since you died for me!
I will suffer for you, since you suffered for me.
Shut my mouth when I would complain.
Ty up my tongue, when I would speak.
If I give scope to my choler,
I shall no more be able to retain it.
I resolve therefore never to speak in passion.
One of the servants that stood by, gave a buffet to Jesus. John. 18.

He has blasphemed, what need we any longer of witnesses? What do you think?
And they answering, said, He is guilty of death. Matthew. 26.

They spit in his-face, and beat him with buffets. ibid.

I have not turned away my face from those that rebuked me, and from those that
spit upon me. Isai. 50.

He shall give his cheek to the striker: he shall be filled with reproaches.
Thren. 3.

Why do thou strike me? John. 18.

I was troubled and did not speak. Ps. 76.

CIII. MED. Of the Contempt that Herod used Jesus Christ with, and that Jesus
Christ showed of Herod.
HErod desires to see Jesus:
And Jesus does not regard him.
Herod asks questions of Jesus:
And Jesus gives him no answer.
Herod requires Miracles of Jesus:
And Jesus works none.
Herod scorns Jesus: And Jesus cares not.
The Wisdom of God passes for folly,
With the People of the wide World.
The Humility of Jesus does not please,
The Grandees and Sages of the World.
Jesus does not speak to the Proud.
He does not manifest himself to the curious.
He is not delighted with the unchaste.
He abhors Adulterers.
He withdraws his graces from the ungrateful.
He despises those that despise him.
He is silent after that he has spoken.
He holds his peace, after he has called.
He withdraws after that he has sought.
Herod, thou did put S. John to death.
Thou did stifle the Voice of Jesus.
Thou have slighted his Counsels.
Thou did sacrifice him to thy Passion.
Jesus is dumb for thee.
Thou have killed his Voice.
Wonder not then that he cannot speak to thee.
O My God!
How dreadful is your silence?
How I fear least you speak no more to me!
Alas! How many Prophets have I put to death?
How many Precursours have I killed?
How many Inspirations have I stifled?
How many Graces have I rejected?
I hear your Word, and I obey it not.
I read good Books, and I profit not.
O I will henceforth obey you!
O I will this day be converted!
Herod was a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of
him, and he hoped to see him work some miracle. Luke 23.

He questioned him with many speeches, but he answered him nothing. ibid.

And Herod with his army set him at naught. ibid.

That which is foolish of God is wiser than men; and that which is weak of God,
is stronger than men. 2 Cor. 1.

To thee, O Lord, will I cry, be not silent from me, least at any time thou
hold thy peace from me, and I shall be like to them that go down into the lake.
Ps. 27.

There is a time to besilent, and a time to speak. Eccl. 3.

CIV. MED. Of the Preference of Barabbas before JESUS Christ.
THe innocent is compared to the nocent.
The just man to a Thief.
A King to a Slave.
The God of sanctity to a Sinner.
This outrage is less sensible to him,
Than that which a Christian does to him,
When he compares him with a Creature.
When he prefers Lucifer before him.
As often as you sin, you make this comparison.
You give him this confusion.
O JESUS!
The greatest, and the least.
The first and the last.
When I see you at the feet of Judas,
I find no place to put my self in.
When I see you beneath Barabbas.
I see nothing but Hell where to hide my self.
Is it just that I should be above you?
You are now the last of all men.
If I prefer my self before one only man,
I must prefer my self before you.
O my Soul!
Suffer contempt. Seek humiliations.
Envy not the elevation of others,
But love abjections.
If thou exaltest thy self, God will depress thee.
Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas or Jesus, that is called Christ?
Matthew 27.

To whom have you compared me, and to whom have you likened me? Isai. 46

They all creed out saying: not him but Barabbas. Job. 19.

I have bred up children, and exalted them, but they have slighted me. Isai. 1.

CV. MED. Of the Flagellation of Jesus Christ.
JEsus was scourged like a Slave.
He is all bathed in his Blood.
His Body is but one wound.
His Bones are seen through his wounds.
The Lamb is now flayed.
He must be put on the Cross.
O Christian Soul!
Take these whips into thy hand.
Do justice to thy self: say,
It is I that have sinned:
It is I that ought to be punished.
Is it just that I should be without wounds?
Seeing my King laden with wounds,
How shall my Body be glorified
Unless it be purged by Sufferings?
Those who are not chastized with Men,
Shall be chastized with the Devils.
O most holy Lamb!
What Crime have thou committed,
That thou should suffer such pain,
And undergo such confusion?
Alas! Thou payest in thy flesh,
The criminal Pleasures of ours.
'Twas for to expiate the sins of our bodies,
That thine was thus torn.
O Virginal Flesh!
Into what a condition, have the infamous
Pleasures of men reduced thee?
O I will chastize my body,
That I may make it like unto thine.
My God!
I confess my cowardice.
I have not the courage to chastize my self.
Take therefore the whip into thy own hand.
Spare not thy Corrections.
I am disposed to all that thou think fit.
Chastize me if it be necessary.
But chastize me like a Father,
And not like a Judge.
Chastize me out of love,
And not in thy wrath.
Chastize me Now, and not in Eternity.
Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. Jo. 19.

He delivered Jesus beaten with whips. Mark. 15.

Our Lord chastizes those he loves: and he scourges every Son whom he receives.
Heb. 12.

CVI. MED. Of the Crowning with Thorns.
JEsus is crowned with Thorns: Sorrows: Ignominies.
He wore this Crown to make his Head suffer.
For to expiate the pleasure of our thoughts.
For to punish our Ambition.
For to purify our Imagination.
For to show what sort of Kingdom his was.
For to declare who are his Subjects.
The Jews renounce him for their King,
And ask to have him crucified.
Christian behold your King!
Will you have him with this Diadem?
If you are the Son of God, as he is,
You must be put on the Cross with him.
If you will wear a Crown of Gold in Heaven,
You must wear a Crown of Thorns on Earth.
Ought a member to be delicate
Under a head crowned with sorrows?
The Crowns of the World, are Crowns that shine.
The Crowns of Jesus, are Crowns that prick.
O ye Daughters of Jerusalem!
Com forth and see King Solomon with the Diadem,
Which his Mother has crowned him with.
Alas! the Synagogue is not a Mother,
But an inhuman Mother-in-Law.
She crowned her self with Roses,
And crowned her God with Thorns.
Christian!
As often as you entertain foul, and ambitious thoughts:
So often do you renew his torments.
You strike in these bloody prickles.
You afflict his spirit.
You crown him with ignominies.
O ye Daughters of Jerusalem!
Behold the man, that has saved you!
Behold the man, whom you have crucified!
The man, who has loved you so much.
The man, whom you cease not still to persecute.
O the fairest of Men! O the greatest of Kings!
I will never offend you more.
The Jews will not have you.
The Worldings will obey Casar.
The Rich will have a God of Silver.
The Sensual will have a God of Pleasures.
And I will have a King of Sorrows.
I will have a poor and despised King.
I will have no other King but JESUS.
I will be crowned like Jesus.
The Soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head, and they put
about him a purple garment. John. 19.

Jesus went forth earrying the Crown of thorns, and the purple vestment. bid.

Lo the Man. ibid.

Lo your King. ibid.

Crowning, he will crown thee with cribulation. Isai. 22.

We have no King, but Caesar. John. 19.

Jesus of Naza reth the King of the Jews. ibid.

My King and my God. Psalm. 5.

CVII. MED. On Jesus Christ's journey in carrying of his Cross.
JESUS carries his Cross on his Shoulders.
He sinks under so heavy a weight.
They substitute a poor man in his room,
Who carries it for him, and after him.
He was forced to take it up,
And follow Jesus Christ.
How coms it that he permits himself to be relieved?
That he does not work a Miracle,
For to carry his Cross?
It Is to teach men, that this Cross is due to them.
That he took it on himself for their sakes.
That we help him to carry his Cross,
When we carry ours with patience.
That to be his Disciples,
We must carry our Cross.
That he carries our Cross with us,
And that we ought to carry his Cross with him.
O happy Simon!
Who carried the Cross of JESUS.
Christian, it is in your power
To have the same honor as he had.
All our Crosses are pieces of his Cross.
They have touched his Soul or his Body.
He first drunk in our Chalice.
He suffered all that we suffer.
He has espoused all our Sorrows.
There is not one of them that entered
Not into his heart.
O JESUS my Lord!
I will follow you wheresoever you go.
And since that you are laden with a Cross,
I will carry one after you.
It Is the Trophy of my Salvation.
It Is the Standard of my Religion.
It Is the Seal of my Predestination.
I will not therefore forsake it.
I will not drag it after me,
But I will carry it, and keep you Company.
O Holy Cross!
Who were consecrated with the blood of a God.
Receive me into thy Arms.
Let me repose on thy Bosom.
Give thy self wholly to me,
As I give my self wholly to thee.
Carry me, that I may carry thee.
Clasp me so strongly betwixt thy arms,
That nothing may separate me from thee.
Carrying his own Cross, he went forth into that which is called the place of
Calvary. John. 19.

Com, and follow me. Mark. 10.

Then Jesus said to his Disciples: if any one will com after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me. Matthew. 16.

I will follow thee whithersoever thou go. Luke 9.

We have all strayed like Sheep: and God laid on him the iniquites of us all.
Isai. 53.

CVIII. MED. Of Jesus Crucified.
JEsus was extended on the Cross.
He was nailed to it by his Hands and Feet.
He is fastened to it with violence.
He is elevated with pain.
He rests only on his Wounds.
There issue out of them four Rivers of Blood,
Which water the Field of the Church,
And which blot out the sins of the World.
He is presented with bitter Wine to drink,
Which would have assuaged his sorrow.
He takes some of it into his mouth,
That he may feel the bitterness of it:
But he does not swallow it down,
That it may not allay his torments.
He is blasphemed: he is cursed:
He is invited to com down from the Cross,
But he remains on it even to the end.
O Jesus I adore thee
On this Throne of Sorrows and Ignominies!
O Divine Savior!
I cast my self into thy arms,
Since thou do extend them for to embrace me.
O Sacred Victim of love,
All burnt and consumed with Sufferings!
O High Priest of the new Law!
What do thou do upon this Cross.
Com down, and all the World will believe in thee.
O com not down!
If thou art the Son of God, thou must die on it.
If thou come down, they will not believe in thee.
They will not follow thee.
Every one will fly from his Cross:
No body will die upon it.
O my dear Cross!
I kiss thee, and embrace thee.
I will die betwixt thy arms.
I have espoused thee in my Baptism.
This Marriage is indissoluble.
There is nothing but death,
That can separate us.
Let the World be no more trouble some to me:
I bear the marks of our Lord Jesus in my Body.
I am Crucified with him.
I will die with him.
My Soul!
Look on thy Savior on the Cross.
It is thy sins which have Crucified him.
He was once Crucified on Calvary,
But how often have thou crucified him in thy heart?
As often as thou do offend him,
So often do thou Crucify him.
Thou must either Crucify Jesus,
Or thy own Passions.
O Jesus make me die!
For fear I should put thee to death.
Crucify my Body,
For fear I Crucify thy Spirit.
They crucified him, and with him two others on this side and that side, and
Jesus in the middle. John. 19.

by whom, etc. Gal. 5.

Crucifying again, to themselves, the Son of God, and making him a mockery.
Heb. 6.

CIX. MED. On the first Word of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
JEsus was a long time on the Cross,
Without uttering so much as a word.
He keeps a profound silence,
And does not complain of his Sorrows.
His Blood does not call for Vengeance,
But for Grace, for those that shed it.
He prays for them in the height of his Pains.
And whilst they insult over his misery,
He excuses their Sin, and diminishes the malice of it.
He does the office of an Advocate,
For those whose Judge he is.
He forgets his own evils
To think on his enemies evils.
Their loss is more sensible to him
Than the Death which they make him suffer.
Keep silence, O Christian Soul,
When thou art on the Cross.
Do not complain of thy Evils.
Do not lose the fruit of thy Sufferings.
Hide thy self in the bosom of Humility,
And repose thy self upon thy Patience.
Pray for thy Enemies.
Forget their Injuries.
Excuse their Intention,
If thou can not excuse their action.
Thou art unworthy of favor,
If thou refuse to pardon them.
O Jesus!
I Pardon my Enemies.
I Pardon all those that crucify me.
Alas! they know not what they do.
They think they do me hurt,
And they procure me much good.
They think they do themselves good,
And they procure much hurt to themselves.
They do themselves more hurt,
Than I could wish to them.
Lord Pardon them; they know not what they do.
I sin out of malice, and they sin out of ignorance.
If they had as much grace as I have,
They would not be so wicked as I am.
If I were tempted, as they are,
I should possibly be wickeder than they.
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Luke 23.

Forgive thy neighbor hurting thee, and then shall thy sins be loosed to thee
when thou prayest. Eccl. 28.

Love your enemies: pray for those that persecute and calumniate you. Matthew. 5.

To me revenge: and I will render it, says our Lord. Romans 12.

CX. MED. On the Repentance of the good Thief, and the Impenitence of the bad
one.
ONe of the Thieves confesses Jesus Christ,
And the other renounces him.
The one adores, the other blasphemes him.
The one ascends up to Heaven by his Cross,
The other falls down into Hell by his Cross.
The one is saved by the side of Jesus;
The other is damned by the side of Jesus.
He is the Redeemer of them both;
And only one makes profit of the Redemption.
He gives his life for them both,
And one of them dies in his obstinacy.
O Judgments of God! how profound are you?
O Goodness of God! how amiable are you?
O Justice of God! how dreadful are you?
O Conducts of God? how admirable are you?
Who will not fear to be damned?
Who will not hope to be saved?
One may be damned in all places.
Since one may be damned by God's side.
One may be saved at all times,
Since one may be saved at the end of his life.
O sweet words to one that is sick!
This day thou shall be with me in Paradise.
Lord forget me not, now thou art in thy Kingdom.
I do indeed desery the evil which I suffer.
But for you: what Crime have you committed!
O Lord let me hear you say,
This day thou shall be with me in Heaven.
One of the two thieves did blaspheme, saying, save thy self and us. Luke 23.

The other rebuked him, saying, Do not thou also fear God? We indeed suffer
justly, for we receive worthy of our doings, but this man has don no evil.
ibid.

Lord remember me when thou shall com into thy Kingdom. Amen I say to thee,
This day shall thou be with me in Paradise. ibid.

There shall be two in one bed, one shall be taken, and the other left behind.
Luke 17.

CXI. MED. Of the Passion of the B. Virgin.
O Good Jesu!
Why do thou suffer thy Mother to follow thee?
How can thou endure that she should see thee die?
Ought not thou to have spared her,
So sensible a grief?
What Crime has she committed,
That she should be present at thy Execution?
God will have Mary to be at the foot of the Cross,
For to cooperate to our Redemption.
For to offer up to God this great Sacrifice.
For to repair Eve's fault.
For to conceive all the Predestinate.
For to be declared their Mother.
For to increase the pains of her Son.
For to take a part in his Sufferings.
For to drink in his Chalice.
For to become the Queen of Martyrs.
For to be crowned with Thorns.
The Martyrs did suffer for Jesus Christ:
Mary did suffer with Jesus Christ.
The Martyrs suffered in their Bodies:
Mary suffered in her Soul.
The Martyrs suffered in their criminal Flesh:
Mary suffered in the innocent Flesh of her Son.
The Martyrs desired Death:
Mary could not desire the Death of her Son.
The hearts of the Martyrs were filled with joy:
The heart of Mary was filled with sadness.
Love diminish't the Torments of the Martyrs:
Love increased the Sorrows of Mary.
Jesus was doubly crucified.
In his Body upon the Cross:
In his Spirit, in the heart of Mary.
Mary was doubly crucified:
Spiritually in her heart:
Corporally in the flesh of her Son.
Love did imprint in her heart
The wounds that were made in his Body.
Those that were not mortal to the Son,
Were mortal to the Mother.
The Lance that opened the heart of Jesus
Pierced the living heart of Mary.
As never Mother loved more,
So never Mother suffered more.
O Daughter of Sion!
To whom shall I compare thee?
Thy sorrow is without example.
It is great like the Ocean.
Its depth is infinite.
Its extent is unconceivable.
There is nothing but the sorrow of thy Son
That is comparable unto thine.
He is the King of Martyrs,
And thou art the Queen of Martyrs.
He is a Man of Sorrows,
And thou art a Woman of Sufferings.
O Christian Soul!
Go with Mary up to Mount Calvary.
Beg of her to receive you for her Child.
Take a share in her Sorrows.
Mingle your tears with hers.
Increase not her Affliction.
Renew not her Passion.
When you sin mortally
You crucify her Son anew.
O how sensible is this death to her!
O how it afflicts her sacred heart!
She consented to his Corporal death,
But she cannot consent to his Spiritual death.
The first restored our life to us.
The second brings death to us.
Suffer, as she did, all Privations.
Remain, as she did, constant in your pains.
You will be no child of Mary's,
Unless you be with her at the foot of the Cross.
Woman behold your Son!
Son behold your Mother!
O Holy Virgin!
O Mother of Sorrows!
O Queen of Martyrs! O Spouse of the Cross!
I choose you for my Mother.
Receive me into the number of your Children.
Imprint in my heart the wounds of your Son.
Fasten me strongly to the Cross.
Give me a part in your sufferings.
If I am guilty: I ought to suffer.
If I am innocent: I ought to imitate you.
Pierce my heart with the sword of grief,
Which transpierced yours.
Let me drink in that Chalice of gall,
Wherewith you were inebriated.
Above all be present at your Child's death.
Receive my Soul into your hands,
And convey it up to Heaven.
A courageous woman who shall find? Prove. 31.

There stood besides the Cross of Jesus, his Mother. Joh. 19.

He said to his Mother, Woman, behold thy Son!

Then he said to his Disciple, Behold thy Mother! ibid.

Thy very Soul a Sword shall pass through, that cogitations may be revealed out
of many hearts. Luke 2.

Thy contrition is great like the Sea. Thren. 2.

CXII. MED. Of the Dereliction of our Lord.
MY God, my God, why have thou forsaken me!
How terrible is that dereliction,
Which makes a God to groan?
Which makes a God to weep?
Which makes a God to cry out?
Which makes the only one of his complaints?
Which he makes before his Enemies?
Before a great number of People?
Which he makes a little before he dies?
Which gives occasion to those that hear him complain,
To doubt whether he were the true Son of God,
Since he is forsaken by his Father?
Jesus was never separated from Grace:
From Glory: from the Divinity.
He was always holy: happy: God.
This terrible Dereliction
Was only a sensible suspension
Of the succors, which the Divinity
Communicated to his Humanity.
It was a shadow of the pain,
Which a Sinner feels, who is in Hell,
Forsaken by Almighty God.
O my God!
I conceive what it is to be damned,
By the pain which your Son suffered on the Cross.
If the deprival of your sensible and comforting presence,
Made your Son to groan,
Who was substantially united to you,
Who will be able to bear for ever
The weight of an infinite wrath?
Who will be able to suffer in Hell,
An eternal separation?
An universal privation
Of your Grace: Love: Presence: Comfort:
Glory: Felicity: Succor: Protection?
Of all that can be desired?
Of all that can be loved?
With a deluge of evils for all Eternity.
O my God! forsake me not,
Although I have forsaken you.
Deprive me, if it must be, of your Pleasures,
But deprive me not of your Grace.
If you forsake me during my life,
Forsake me not at my Death.
If you forsake me now,
Forsake me not in Eternity.
O Jesus!
It Is I that have committed the Sin,
And you have born the Punishment.
It Is I that ought to be forsaken,
And you were forsaken for my sake.
O how your Dereliction affrights me!
O how your Dereliction comforts me!
You were forsaken at your death,
That I might not be forsaken at mine.
Forsake me not then, O Lord,
When all the World has forsaken me.
My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me. Matthew. 28.

Forsake me not, O Lord my God, go not away from me Ps. 37.

Cast me not away in the time of my old age, when my strength fails me, forsake
me not. Ps. 70.

My enemies said: God has forsaken him: persecute and lay hold of him, because
there is none to deliver him. ibid. Forsake me not wholly. Ps 118.

He said: I will not desert, nor forsake thee. Heb. 13.

CXIII. MED. On the Thirst of our Lord on the Cross.
JEsus thirsts, and no body gives him to drink.
They give him gall and vinegar,
For all his refreshment.
He was willing to suffer this torment,
For to punish our gluttonies;
And to undergo
All the Punishments, which sin deserves.
He was forsaken in his Soul,
And consumed with sorrows in his Body.
All his Senses were crucified.
His Eyes by the sight of his Enemies.
His Ears by their Blasphemies.
His Smell by the infection of the place.
His Touch by his wounds.
His Taste by the bitterness of the gall.
His Memory by the sight of our crimes.
His Understanding by the darkness.
His Will by the terrors.
His Appetite by infirmity,
By disgust, and by sadness.
He had no Part in his Body,
Which was not laden with wounds.
He suffered like a mere man,
Who neither had been God, nor happy.
The Victim was indeed flayed,
But it was still sound within.
The whips had taken off the skin,
But they had not touched the entrails.
That he might afflict all the organs
Of our Excesses and Gluttonies,
He suffered a cruel Thirst.
He makes the bitterness of his Chalice
Descend down into his Body.
Then was the Book of this divine Lamb
Written both within and without.
Jesus complains that he is athirst,
Knowing that they would give him gall to drink.
He discovers to us his sorrow,
And the love that consumed him.
He thirsts after our Salvation, and Perfection.
He desires to suffer more.
It Is Love that makes him die.
O Jesus my Savior!
What can I do for your relief?
Cannot I quench your thirst?
Doubtless you desire something of me.
What is that thirst that burns you?
O I know what it is that you require!
You would have me quit this Sin.
Renounce that company.
Draw near unto your Cross.
Entertain my self with your Sufferings.
Apply my self a little to Prayer.
Give my self to Devotion.
Keep silence, when I am provoked and offended.
This is what you desire of me.
This is what will quench your thirst.
Shall I dare to refuse
This relief to your Pains?
O that I did burn with your love,
As you burnt with mine;
O that I could suffer for you
As much as you suffered for me.
O how love makes me languish!
O I have long desired to die!
That the Scripture might be fulfilled, he said, I thirst. John. 19.

O that some one would give me water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in
the gate. 1 Par. 11.

Woman give me to drink. John. 4.

They gave for my food, gall, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Ps. 98.

As the heart desires the fountains of waters; so does my soul thirst after the
living God. Ps. 41.

CXIV. MED. On the sixth Word of our Lord on the Cross.
ALL is Consummate.
Jesus having taken the Vinegar, said,
All is accomplished.
The Holocaust is consummated.
The Commands of my Father are executed.
The Gospel is announced.
The Prophecies are verified.
The ransom of mankind is paid.
Their sins are pardoned.
The Captives are delivered.
Heaven is opened.
The Sacraments are instituted.
The Devils are overcom.
The World is repaired.
I have nothing more to say, do, or suffer.
I have nothing now to do,
But to give up my soul.
It Is now in the power of men
To live well, and save themselves.
O the happy Consummation of the just!
O the unhappy Consummation of the wicked!
All is Consummate: the sinners will say,
Our pleasures are past.
Our pastimes are at an end.
Our fair days are eclipsed.
Our hopes are vanished away.
Our time is slid away.
Our life is ended.
Our malice is Consummated.
We must now begin to suffer
An evil which can never end.
We must begin a misery,
Which will never be Consummated.
All is Consummate: the Just will say,
Our evil days are past away.
Our sufferings are terminated.
Our combats are ended.
Our troubles are calmed.
Our sorrows are allayed.
Our infirmities are cured.
Our tears are wiped away.
Our Miseries are Consummated.
There is no more Cross for us to bear.
No more evil to suffer.
No more Penance to do.
We are going into a Country of Peace,
Where our joy shall never have an end.
Choose, O Christian Soul,
One of these two Consummations!
You must of necessity one day say,
All is Consummate.
Will you say it, as Lazarus did?
Or will you say it, as Dives did?
Will you say it, as JESUS did?
Or as Pilate did?
When your time is Consummated,
You will find that all is but vanity.
O Jesus, the Author of our Faith!
And the Consummator of our Salvation!
Let me consume my life for you,
As you consumed yours for me.
Let me accomplish all your commands.
Let me spend my self for your glory.
Let me burn with your love.
Let me make a victim of my body.
Let me annihilate my self continually.
Let me fulfill all your designs.
Let me acquit me of all my duties,
Let me say with truth, when I die,
All is ended. All is consummate.
It is consummate. John. 19.

By this one oblation he consummated for ever the sanctified. Heb. 10.

Looking upon the Author of faith, and the Consummator Jesus. Heb. 12.

He learnt by those things which he suffered obedience, and he was made
consummate. Heb. 5.

If a man lives many years, and do rejoice in all these things, he must
remember the darksom time, and the evil days, which when they com, the things
that are past will be argued of vanity. Eccles. 11.

CXV. MED. On the last Word of JESUS Christ on the Cross.
FAther, into thy hands I commend my soul.
Jesus leaves himself to his Father,
When he is forsaken by him.
He teaches us how to die,
As he taught us how to live.
He teaches us confidence,
After he had taught us patience.
Let us imitate Jesus living.
Let us imitate Jesus dying.
Let us rest betwixt his arms.
Let us recommend our souls into his hands.
He is our Father: Can he forsake us?
He is our Savior: Will he damn us?
Let us at our death, say to Jesus Christ,
Father, into thy hands I recommend my Spirit.
It came from thee, as from its beginning:
It returns to thee, as to its end.
It is a blast of thy mouth.
It Is an emanation of thy spirit.
It Is the price of thy blood.
It Is the Sanctuary of thy Grace.
I recommend it into thy hands,
Which were pierced for its sake.
I recommend it to thy heart,
Which burnt with love for it.
O Lord take it into thy care,
And when it has left its body,
I beseech thee, not to forsake it.
Unless it fall into thy hands,
Alas! its Salvation is desperate.
O Lord permit not that Soul to be lost,
Which has cost thee so dear.
Go forth, O my Soul, quit thy Body!
How coms it that thou apprehendest death?
JESUS has answered for thee.
He has recommended thee to his Father,
When he recommended to him his own Spirit.
Go forth of thy Body, O Christian Soul!
In the name of the Father, who created thee:
In the name of the Son, who redeemed thee:
In the name of the Holy Ghost, who sanctified thee.
Jesus calls thee to his Heaven.
Bow down thy head through obedience.
Fear nothing: thou art in security
In the hands of JESUS Christ.
Jesus crying with a loud voice, said. Father, into thy hands I commend my
spirit: And saying this, he gave up the Ghost. Luke 23.

And bowing down the head, he gave up the Ghost. John. 19.

Our King before ages wrought Salvation in the midst of the Earth. Psalm. 73.

He that adheres to our Lord, is one spirit. 1 Cor. 6.

If God be for us, who is against us? Romans 8.

Therefore let those who suffer according to the Will of God, recommend their
Souls to their faithful Creator in good deeds. 1 Pet. 4.

CXVI. MED. Of the Death of the Son of God.
JESUS is dead.
Who will fear death?
He died for us.
Who will refuse to die for him?
He died wasted with pains.
Who will refuse to suffer?
He died for his Servants:
Who will serve any other Master but him?
He died for our sins:
Who will dare to put him to death again?
O the good Shepherd!
Who died for his Sheep.
O the High Priest!
Who immolated himself for men.
O the faithful Friend!
Who loved us until death.
O the Divine Master!
Who placed his Chair on Mount Calvary.
O JESUS!
Since thou did die for me,
It is just, that I should die for thee.
Since thou have given me the example,
I must die as thou did.
Wherefore I pardon all my enemies.
I hope thou will give me thy Heaven.
Recommend me, I pray, to thy good Mother.
Bid her take care of me.
O forsake me not, O my God,
When all the World forsakes me.
Sustain me by thy grace,
When I have lost the strength of my body.
I thirst. I desire to see thee. I desire to die.
When will my end com?
When shall I consummate my Sacrifice?
O my Father!
I recommend my spirit into thy hands.
I unite my death with thy Son's.
Remember that he redeemed me with his blood.
Lose not my soul, which is of so great value.
Bowing down his head, he gave up the Ghost. John. 19.

The just man perishes, and no body thinks of it in his heart. Isai. 57.

Think upon him, who endured such contradiction against himself from sinners,
that you may not be wearied in your minds fainting. Heb. 12.

He died for the wicked. Romans 5.

Christ died for us. ibid.

For this end did Christ die, and rose again, that he might be Lord of the quick
and the dead. Romans 14.

Your are dead, and your life is hid with Christ, etc. Col. 3.

CXVII. MED. In form of Prayer on the seven Stations of the Sufferings of the
Son of God.
1. STATION.
O Jesus my Savior, who did sweat blood and water in the Garden of Olives,
at the sight of thy torments, and of my sins! And who did strip thy self of
thy farce, for to cloth thy self with my Infirmities. I aadore thee, all
bathed in thy blood. I give thanks to thy sacred heart for having afflicted it
self for my sake. I detest all the sins, which did cause so great a sadness. I
resolve to die rather than ever more to afflict thee. Give me grace, that I may,
as thou did, conceive a great sorrow for my iniquities: that I may resist,
even unto blood, the Temptations of the Devil, and of the Flesh; and that I may
conform my self in all things to thy example, and to the will of thy Father.

2. STAT.
O Jesus, my Lord, who were buffeted, and ill treated in the houses of Annas
and Caiphas, I give thee thanks for having suffered these injuries, and these
confusions for the love of me. Alas! how often have I buffeted and injured thee
in the person of my neighbor; since thou reckonest as don to thy self all the
ill that is don to him? I beg most humble pardon of thee for it: And I resolve
henceforth, for thy sake, to suffer all the injuries that shall be don to me:
and never more to offend thee in the person of my Brothers, either by action,
words, judgment, or will.

3. STAT.
O Jesus my King, who were scorned by Herod, and by the Jews; when they
preferred a Robber, a Seditious fellow, and a Man-killer, before thee. I beg
pardon of you, for having so often preferred the Devil and wretched Creatures
before you. I promise, never more to dishonor you. You shall always be the
King of my heart, and I will rather die than lay you, as I have don, under the
feet of Lucifer, that Robber, that Seditious wretch, and Murderer of all men.

4. STAT.
O Jesus, the purest and chastest of all men, whose innocent flesh was torn
with the blows of the Whips in Pilate's house, for to expiate the Criminal
Pleasures that we take in our flesh. I acknowledge, that it was for my sake
that you suffered such cruel torments. I am sorry for having given you so many
wounds, and that I have so often renewed them by the satisfaction which I have
given to my Senses. I conjure you by your Dolours to sanctify my Body and
Soul, and to wash them with your precious blood from all their Impurities, and
never to suffer that that flesh, which has been washed in your blood, be ever
stained with any sin.

5. STAT.
O Jesus the greatest of all Kings, who were crowned with Thorns, and did
wear on thy Shoulders the Royal Marks of thy Principality. I acknowledge thee
for my King, as despised and disfigured as thou art. And since thou have no
part of thy body, which was not wounded: I will take no more pleasure in my
body: but will live in grief and pain, that I may be one of thy Subjects, and
one of thy Members.

6. STAT.
O Jesus my Redeemer, who for my sake were fastened to a Cross, and who did
shed all thy blood for to rescue me from the power of the Devil, whose Slave I
was. I give the thanks for this incomparable love that thou did bear to me:
for so many torments which thou did suffer for my sake. I kiss with respect
thy sacred feet, and thy sacred hands, which were pierced for my sake. I adore
that sacred heart, which was opened for my love, and I promise rather to die,
than ever more to crucify thee in mine.

7. STAT.
O Jesus my life, who did die for me: and who were forsaken by thy Father,
that I might not be forsaken at my death. O most meek Lamb! immolated for the
Salvation of men: Victim of Love and Patience, who were consummated on a pile
of sorrows. O the Saint of Saints! O the King of Kings! What can I do for to
acknowledge so great a goodness? Why may not I die for you, as you died for me?
I believe, that thou art my Savior: and I should despair, did I not believe
it. I hope that thou will pardon me my sins, and that thou will bestow on me
thy Heaven, since thou gave me thy life. I detest my Crimes, which are the
cause of thy death, and I will rather lose my life than ever make thee die in my
heart, since this death is infinitely more sensible and more ignominious to thee
than that of the Cross. I beg your pardon for all those, who have offended me.
I give my self to your holy Mother. I choose her for mine, and I desire to die
betwixt her arms. I recommend my spirit into thy hands: and I conjure thee by
thy dereliction, not to forsake me at the hour of my death, but to receive me
into thy Heaven; there to see thee, there to love thee, there to praise and
bless thee for all Eternity. Amen.

This Prayer may be recited in the time of Mass, before Confession and
Communion, especially when one is sick, and on all Fridays in the year, at the
foot of the Cross. You must make a little Pause at each Station, and produce in
heart the acts that you pronounce with your mouth.

CXVIII. MED. On the Burial of Jesus Christ.
JEsus from the Cross is laid in the Tomb.
Here is an end of his labors.
This is the place of his rest.
This is the term of his journeys.
His Disciples do almost lose their Faith,
By having lost his Presence.
They are fearful and dejected,
Because they see and hear him no longer.
Happy is he who receives into his heart
Jesus descending from the Cross.
The grain of wheat that it may fructify
Must dye, and be hidden.
The arms of the Priest at the Altar,
Are the arms of the Cross.
Your heart is the grave, wherein he would rejoice.
Happy is he who is crucified.
Who is dead and buried.
Who is hid in the ground.
Who is trod under foot.
Who is unknown to men. Who reposes in God.
He will soon rise again with Jesus,
Immortal and impassible like him.
Happy is he who conceives his Faith
In the death and obscurity of his Senses.
Who loses not his hope, having lost his support.
Who ceases not to love,
Having nothing that can comfort him.
O Jesus! Hide me in thy grave.
Bury me in thy shroud,
That I may be no more known by men.
Let me die to all my senses.
I am ready to go along with you,
Even into the Prisons of Hell.
Provided, that I be in your company,
I shall have nothing to apprehend.
Hell with you, would be a Heaven to me.
Heaven without you, would be a Hell to me.
Joseph taking the body, wrapped it in a clean Sindon, and laid it in his own new
monument, which he had hewed out of a rock. Matthew. 27.

Woman, why weepest thou? They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where
they have put him. John. 20.

My Soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near unto Hell. Ps. 87.

I was reputed with those that descend into the lake: I became like a man
without help, free amongst the dead. ibid.

They laid me in the lower lake, in dark places, and in the shadow of death.
ibid.

Like the vvounded that sleep in their graves. ibid.

CXIX. MED. Of the Resurrection of our Lord.
JEsus is risen again.
He enjoys a glorious life.
He is com out of his grave.
He has conquered death.
He has triumphed over Satan.
He has broken to pieces the gates of Hell.
He has carried away the spoils.
He has frightened his guards.
He has confounded the Jews.
He is victorious over all his Enemies.
My Soul weep no more,
Jesus has resumed a new life.
He will die no more in thy heart,
Unless thy Sin do crucify him there.
Jesus is risen again in our Souls.
He is re-entred into his Kingdom.
He has droven the Devils thence.
He has triumphed over Sin.
He keeps our Passions Captives.
He dwells therein by his Grace.
He lives there by his Spirit.
He reigns there by his Love.
He reposes there by his Peace.
All the whole Church is risen again.
His whole Body is out of the grave.
All his Members are re-animated.
They are no more dead, nor sick.
My Soul, weep no more,
Jesus has, etc.
Jesu tarry with us; for night draws on.
The day is going down.
The Devils gather together.
The Lions roar. Our Passions revolt.
Ill habits awaken. The World takes arms.
Our flesh takes strength again.
Your life is not in assurance.
Hell has conspired against you.
The wicked have sworn your death.
They will renew your sufferings.
My Soul, etc.
O ye senceless Galathians!
What do you intend to do?
Do not you know Jesus any more?
But two days ago you lamented his death,
And now you are contriving
To take away his life.
You are preparing Scourges for to tear him.
Thorns to crown him with.
Crosses to nail him to.
What has he don for to be crucified?
Is he criminal for having loved you?
Does he deserve death for having saved you?
My Soul, etc.
Our Lord is truly risen, and has appeared to Simon. Luke 24.

Christ rising from the dead, dies no more: death shall domineer no more over
him. Romans 6.

If ye are risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, not that are on
earth. Col. 3.

Crucifying to themselves again the Son of God, and setting him at naught. Heb.
6.

CXX. MED. Of our Lord's Wounds.
JEsus has Wounds, although he be risen.
Do not wonder at the Wounds,
That remain after your Resurrection;
There is no hurt in feeling them.
There is merit in enduring them.
Be impassible to your passions.
Be immovable in your temptations.
The Wounds of Jesus enlighten our Faith.
They support our Hope.
They inflame our Love.
We cannot doubt of his affection.
We see his heart through his Wounds.
We ought no longer to be diffident.
Jesus is our Advocate in Heaven.
He prays for us by as many mouths,
As he has Wounds in his Body.
The Nails, are the Keys that have opened
This Ark of our Redemption.
All the Treasures which it includes,
Are now at our disposal.
O Jesus my Savior!
How do your Wounds comfort me:
Secure me: encourage me?
There issues from thence a Balsam,
Which cures all my sorrows.
Who will dare to accuse me,
Knowing that you are my Advocate?
Who will dare to condemn me,
Knowing that you are my Judge?
Who will dare to declare against me,
Knowing that you are my Savior?
O divine Savior!
Imprint on me your sacred Stigmats.
Imprint them in my Soul, and in my Body.
Who can live without Wounds,
Seeing you covered with Wounds?
I cannot love my heart,
Unless it be wounded like yours.
Alas! that which shall be the joy of the Predestinate,
Will be the torment of the damned.
He showed them his hands and feet. Luke 24.

He showed them his hands and side. John. 20.

What are those wounds in the midst of thy hands? With these was I wounded in
the house of those that loved me. Zech. 13.

Behold I have written thee in my hands. Isai. 49.

Whom thou have stricken they have persecuted, and they have added to the pain
of my wounds. Ps. 68.

CXXI. MED. Of the good Shepherd.
JEsus is a good Shepherd.
He knows all his sheep.
He knows them as he is known by his Father.
He gives them life, as he receives it from him.
He calls them all by their name.
He conducts them in straight ways.
He has a particular Providence for them.
He always walks before them,
With the Crook of the Cross in his hand.
He brings them back when they go astray.
He casts himself into the briars,
For to draw out him that is lost.
He lays him on his shoulders.
He carries him back to the fold.
He testifies a joy at it,
And he does him no hurt.
Jesus is a good Shepherd.
He feeds his dear Sheep.
He leads them into fat Pastures.
He nourishes them with his Word.
He fats them with his Flesh.
He inebriates them with his Blood.
He fortifies them with his grace.
He quickens them with his spirit.
He enriches them with his merits.
What Shepherd feeds his sheep
With his own Flesh and his own Blood as he does?
Jesus is a good Shepherd.
He gives his life for his sheep.
He does not feed upon their flesh,
Not cloth himself with their wool.
Not strip them, to cloth himself.
He fasted, for to feed them.
He labors only for them.
He defends them against the wolves.
He hinders them from coming near them.
He helps them to drive them off.
He lifts them up when they fall.
He carries them when they are feeble.
He comforts them when they are sad.
He cures them when they are sick.
He raises them to life, when they are dead.
O Jesus!
How good a Shepherd are you?
But what bad sheep have you?
They stray away from your conduct.
They despise your Pastures.
They will not eat at your table.
They go every where to seek after wolves.
They howl and run after them.
They devour the sheep as they do.
O my Divine Shepherd!
For my part, I will follow you every where.
I will never go astray from your ways.
I will go up to the Mountains with you.
I will go down into the Vales with you.
I will never complain of you.
I will be always contented with you.
I am a good Shepherd: I know my sheep, and my sheep know me. John. 10.

He goes before them, and the Sheep follow him. ibid.

And I am not troubled following thee my Pastor. Jer. 17.

Our Lord governs me, nothing will be wanting to me: he placed me in a place of
pasture. Psalm. 22.

I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; seek after thy servant. Psalm. 118.

CXXII. MED. Of the Sheep of Jesus Christ.
THe Sheep loves his Shepherd.
He follows his Conduct every where
He hears, and owns his voice.
He is in assurance with him.
He is lost when he goes a stray.
He goes well when he follows him.
Jesus committed to Saint Peter
The Conduct of his Flock.
His voice is heard in the Church:
Out of the Church it is not heard.
Virtues without Obedience,
Are large steps out of the way.
One goes astray instead of advancing,
Who advances without being directed.
A Sheep does not argue:
He goes whither he is led.
He never goes righter,
Than when he follows his Shepherd.
He leaves himself to his Conduct.
He fears nothing in his Company.
It Is to be without judgment,
To trust to one's own judgment.
It is to have no guidance,
Not to be willing to be guided.
A Sheep does not murmur.
He does not fall into impatience.
Does not take offense at his Shepherd.
Does not complain of his conduct.
Suffers himself to be stripped.
Goes quietly to his death.
Suffers his Throat to be cut.
Dies without saying any thing.
There is need of extreme patience,
For to endure impatient men.
They would have God to endure from them,
But they will endure nothing from God.
A Sheep has no fangs.
He does not bite his Companions.
He is the mildest of all Creatures.
He has nothing of fierceness or wildness.
He hates singularity.
He maintains himself in unity.
He keeps Society.
Is pleased in the Community.
The Mark of the Sheep of Jesus,
Is Mildness and Charity.
Are you one of Jesus's his Sheep?
Do you love the Pastor of the Church?
Do you follow God's Conduct?
Do you leave your self to his Providence?
Do you obey your Superiors?
Do you renounce your own proper lights?
Do you complain of your losses?
Do not you murmur in your pains?
Do you love your Neighbor?
Do not you offend him in word?
Have you a compassion of him?
Are not you angry as he is?
Thou that rulest Israel attend, who leadest on Joseph like a Sheep. Psalm. 79.

My foot has followed his footsteps. Job. 13.

He shall be led like a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before the
shearer he shall be dumb, and shall not open his mouth. Isai. 53.

I was dumb, and did not open my mouth, because thou did do it. Psalm. 38.

In this shall all know, that you are my Disciples, if you love one another.
Jo. 13.

If you bite and eat each other, see ye be not consumed by each other. Gal. 5.

CXXIII. MED. Of the Ascension of our Lord.
WHither go you, O divine Shepherd?
Is it thus, that you forsake your Sheep?
Whither go you, O charitable Father?
Is it thus, that you forsake your Children?
Whither go you, O glorious Captain?
Is it thus, that you forsake your Soldiers?
What will poor Sheep do in the midst of Wolves?
What will poor Children do in the midst of the Streets?
What will Soldiers do in the midst of their Enemies?
Go my well beloved.
Quit this ungrateful Earth,
That has used you so ill.
An immortal body like yours,
Ought not to be in the region of death.
An incorruptible body like yours,
Ought not to be in a place of corruption.
An impassible body like yours,
Ought not to be in a place of affliction.
Go great Conqueror.
Ascend up to Heaven, which you have gained.
Take possession of the Kingdom,
Which is yours from all Eternity.
Carry along with you your victorious Troops,
For to honor your Triumph.
Stop not till you have reached the highest Heaven.
Go and sit upon the Throne of God.
It is just that you should rest,
After having labored so much.
It is just that you should receive glory,
After having been so mightily humbled.
Go Ark of our Lord,
After having been beaten with the Waves,
Go and rest on the highest Mountains of Armenia.
Arise, O Lord, ascend to your place of rest.
You, and the Ark of your Sanctification.
You have broken down the Gates of Hell:
Go now and open the Gates of Heaven.
Enter into the Palace of your glory.
Go and prepare us a place.
Go and present your self to your Father.
Go and show him your Wounds.
Go and be our Mediator.
Go and send us your Holy Spirit.
O Jesus!
Since you are gone to Heaven,
I find no more comfort here upon Earth.
My heart is where my treasure is.
My soul would fain quit her body,
For to go and enjoy your presence.
When shall I go out of this exile?
When shall I return to my dear Country?
O Jesus!
The hope of forlorn Souls!
The comfort of afflicted Souls.
You promised to draw all things to you,
When you were elevated from the Earth.
You are now above all the Heavens,
Perform now your promise.
Draw me out of this World.
Take me off from Creatures.
Draw me strongly,
For I cling close to the Earth.
Draw me quickly,
For I am weary of living.
Alas! What a life!
Ah! What a death!
O my dear Life.
Give me death, that I may die to my self,
And live Eternally to you.
And our Lord Jesus after he had spoken was assumed into Heaven, and sits at
the right hand of God. Mark. 16.

Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave gifts. Ephesians. 4.

Let not your heart be troubled: I go to prepare you a place: I will take you
to my self, that where I am you also may be. John. 14.

And if I be exalted from the Earth, I will draw all to my self. John. 12.

Draw me after thee. Cant. 5.

CXXIV. MED. Of the coming down of the Holy Ghost.
WE are not members of Jesus Christ,
Unless we live by his Spirit.
The Spirit of JESUS,
Is a Spirit of Life, which animates us.
It Is a Spirit of Grace, that sanctifies us.
A Spirit of Wisdom, which instructs us.
A Spirit of Love, which unites us.
A Spirit of Peace, which pacifies us.
A Spirit of Purity, which purifies us.
A Spirit of Liberty, which disengages us.
A Spirit of Joy, which comforts us.
A Spirit of Humility, which humbles us.
A Spirit of Obedience, which subjects us.
The Spirit of JESUS,
Makes men Gods. Of sinners, just.
Of weak, makes us strong. Of sad, glad.
Of cold, fervent. Of choleric, mild.
Of ignorant, wise. Of timid, courageous.
The Spirit of JESUS,
Does not descend upon the proud.
It does not repose in turbulent hearts.
It has a horror of impure souls.
It withdraws it self from vain spirits.
It is not in agreement with the flesh.
It makes a mortal War with it.
It could not com down upon the Apostles,
Whilst they saw JESUS sensibly.
It lives in us by Grace.
It dwells in us by Charity.
It reigns in us by Love.
It reposes in us by Peace.
We afflict it by Venial sin.
We style it by Mortal sin.
We lose it by the love of the World.
We drive it away by the love of the Flesh.
O my God!
How gentle is your spirit?
How severe is mine?
How holy is yours?
How profane is mine?
How humble is yours?
How proud is mine?
O Holy Spirit,
Father of the poor!
Comfort of the afflicted.
Com, and descend down to us, and comfort us.
Enlighten us by your Light.
Conduct us by your Grace.
Sanctify us by your Love.
Support us by your Strength.
Penetrate us by your Unction.
Adopt us by your Charity.
Pacify us by your Presence.
Save us by your Mercy.
It Is the Spirit which enlivens. John. 6.

They were all replenisht with the Holy Ghost. Act. 2.

Grace is diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us. Romans 5.

If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his. Romans 8.

Whoever are acted by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God. ibid.

If we live in spirit, let us walk in spirit. Gal. 5.

CXXV. MED. Of the most Sacred Trinity.
MAn believes that there are as many Gods,
As he loves Creatures.
He adores a Trinity on Earth,
And contemns the Trinity of Heaven.
He esteems only the grandures of the World.
He seeks after nothing but earthly riches.
He desires nothing but the pleasures of the Senses.
He despises the Wisdom of God.
He laughs at the power of the Father.
He outrages the goodness of the Holy Ghost.
Is it to believe that God is wise,
And not to apprehend his Wrath?
Is it to believe that God is holy,
And yet offend him by so many Crimes?
Is it to believe that God is pure,
And yet to cleave to the pleasures of the Senses?
Is it to believe that God is good,
And yet not to love him?
Is it to believe God to be independent,
And yet not to adore him?
Is it to believe God to be beneficent,
And yet not to thank him?
O most Holy Trinity!
I bless thee, and I adore thee.
I will love thee both in Time and Eternity.
Glory be to the Father, who created me.
Glory be to the Son, who redeemed me.
Glory be to the Holy Ghost, who sanctified me.
Glory be to the Father, who supports me by his Power.
Glory be to the Son, who governs me by his Wisdom.
Glory be to the Holy Ghost, who sanctifies me by his Love.
Glory be to the Father, who sustains my Being.
Glory be to the Son, who enlightens my Understanding.
Glory be to the Holy Ghost, who consecrates my Will.
Let the Holy Trinity be blessed,
By Angels, and Men: in Time and in Eternity.
Amen. So be it.
Going, teach ye all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Matthew. 28.

Three there are who give testimony in Heaven, the Father, Word, and Holy
Ghost, and these three are one. 1 John. 5.

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, the Earth is full of thy glory. Isai. 6.

All that is in the World is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the
concupiscence of the eyes, and pride of life. 1 John. 8.

CXXVI. MED. In form of a Dialogue. Of the Institution of the Blessed Sacrament
of the Altar.
The Disciple. I Will speak unto my Lord,
Although I am but ashes and dust.
O my God! How wonderful is your Wisdom?
How profound are your Mysteries?
Whence coms it that you would remain on Earth,
Since your Body is glorious.
Ought not the noblest of all Bodies
To be on the top of the highest Heavens?
Your Throne is in the Firmament.
The Earth is but your Footstool.
Why do not you dwell in your Palace?
What do you do upon our dunghill?

The Master. I would remain here upon Earth,
For to content my love.
I converse with men,
For to content their desires.
I am with my Disciples,
For to content them by my Presence.
I am amongst my sheep,
For to defend them against the Wolves.
I leave my self to my Church,
For to serve them for a Victim.
I immolate my self on the Altars,
For to do homage to my Father.
You would have no Religion,
If you had no Sacrifice.
The ancient ones are abrogated:
There is only I alone, that can be immolated.
My body is in Heaven, as in its Natural place.
My Body is on Earth, as in a Sacramental place.
When I came down upon Earth,
I did not for that quit Heaven.
And when I re-ascended to Heaven,
I did not for all that quit the Earth.

The Disciple. I will again speak to you, O Lord,
Although I am but ashes and dust.
Whence coms it that remaining on Earth,
You did not make your self visible?
Why did you hide your self,
Since you desire to be beloved?
You would have won all hearts,
If you had discovered your self to your eyes.

The Master. I am a hidden God.
One must die for to see me.
I hid my Divinity under the form of a Man.
And I hide my Humanity
Under the form of Bread.
Your life is a state of Faith,
My Body ought therein to be veyled.
Your life is a state of Merit,
Your Understanding ought therein to be humbled.
Adam did not give credit to my word,
But he credited that of the Serpent.
A blind credulity, ought to repair his curiosity.
Faith consecrates your Understanding.
It humbles pour Pride.
It raises your Knowledges.
It makes you subject to God.
You must believe, that you may see.
Faith goes before glory.
And how can you have Faith,
If what you see be not hidden?

The Disciple. I will again speak, etc.
Doutless your Humanity,
For to be an object of our Faith,
Ought to be hid, as well as your Divinity.
But why under the form of Bread?
Is this state suitable to you?
What honor is not due to you?
Who can honor you in this figure?

The Master. My Wisdom would not be infinite,
Unless it were incomprehensible.
It would not be wonderful,
Unless it were unconceivable.
Wisdom avoids the open light.
It hides it self in darkness.
Goodness flies from obscurity,
And would produce it self into the light.
Wisdom hides it self,
Because it would be admired.
Goodness discovers it self,
Because it would be beloved.
A God under the form of a man
Is a more astonishing change,
Than a man under the form of bread.
Than a body in form of aliment.
Did not they eat the Lamb? the Manna?
The loaves of Proposition?
If the figures were eaten,
The Truth also ought to be eaten.
You stood in need of a Sacrament,
For the nourishment of your Souls.
As your life is divine,
You stood in need of a divine food.
As you have a Soul and Body,
So there was requisite my Soul, and my Body.
Unless you eat my flesh, you will not have life.
All men were to eat it:
There was therefore requisite an aliment
That all men might make use of.
Men have different tastes:
But all men love bread.
I took this amiable figure,
That I might be eaten without horror.
That I might enter into the bottom of your heart.
That I might communicate my Spirit to you.
For to purify your body.
For to assuage its concupiscence.
For to cure it of its maladies.
For to give it my purity,
And my virginal qualities.
Bread, is an aliment
Which shows the effects of the Sacrament.
I would have you all to be united together.
I would transform you into my self.
As I live for my Father,
So I would have you live for me.

The Disciple. O divine Master!
How admirable is your Wisdom?
You are truly a hidden God.
O what Bread! O what a Feast! O what a Table!
O how am I obliged to you,
That you would remain with us!
That you would take this figure,
For to communicate your self to us.
I believe: I will not see.
I am called a Believer, and not a Rationalist.
What shall I do to acknowledge you?
Since you remain with me,
I will remain with you.
Since you humble your self for me,
I will humble my self for you.
Since you destroy your self for me,
I will destroy my self for you.
Since you will live in me,
I will also live in you.

CXXVII. MED. Of the Love of JESUS Christ in the Sacrament of the Altar.
THis Sacrament proceeds from Love.
This Sacrament contents Love.
This Sacrament produces Love.
The Son of God did institute it out of Love.
He ascended up to Heaven out of Justice:
But he remained on Earth out of Love.
Did men deserve this favor?
They made themselves unworthy of it.
Does there any advantage accrue to him by it?
He suffers therein a great contempt.
Love has triumphed over God.
Love made him com down on Earth.
Love made him stay there.
Love keeps him as it were Prisoner there.
Love tends unto Unity.
It Is the end of all its desires.
It finds in the Communion,
All its satisfaction.
There it is that Jesus unites himself to us:
There it is that we unite our selves to him.
That he transforms himself into us:
That we transform our selves into him.
That he becoms one self-same thing with us:
That we become one self-same thing with him.
There is but one person made up
Of the aliment, and of him that takes it.
There is a distinction every where,
But there is none in the food.
This is that which contents Love.
This is that which makes it a Sacrament of Love.
Knowledge begets Love.
Presence nourishes Love.
Affection enkindles Love.
Benefits do draw Love.
The Soul here sees her well-beloved.
She enjoys his Presence.
She discovers his affection.
She is filled with his graces and favors.
The heart may resist hatred:
But it cannot resist Love.
She there finds her beloved:
She there finds her delights.
She there finds her Love.
Ah! whence coms it that I am all ice?
Whence coms it that I have so little love!
What Nature is my heart made of?
How can it defend it self?
Love encompasses it on all sides,
And yet it knows not what Love is.
Love shows it self to my eyes.
Love makes it self be heard to my ears.
Love makes it self be tasted by my mouth.
Love makes it self be felt by my heart.
Love calls me: draws me: warms me:
Fights me: flatters me: obliges me:
Does all things to win me.
And yet I know not what it is to love.
Whence coms this insensibility?
O it is because I love Creatures.
It is because I am not disengaged.
It is because my heart is divided.
It is because I am not mortified.
My Soul!
Will thou always be ungrateful?
Will thou never let thy heart be won?
Shall not a God, who is always with thee,
A God, who gives himself all to thee,
A God, who annihilates himself for thee,
A God, who stands not in need of thee,
Who is happy without thee,
Who has so much Love for thee,
Who bestows so many benefits on thee,
Win thy heart?
Cannot he deserve thy affection?
O, I can no longer resist this Love!
No longer defend my self from its pursuits.
I will no longer withdraw through fear.
I will approach out of Love.
O, I will mortify my self,
For I cannot live without loving.
I will communicate frequently,
For I cannot live without eating.
The children of Israel said to one another, Manhu, which signifies, What is
this? for they were ignorant, what it was. To whom Moses said, This is the
bread which our Lord has given you to eat. Exodus 16.

This is the bread that came down from Heaven: not as your Fathers did eat
Manna, and died. He that eats this bread shall live for ever. John. 6.

Who shall give us of his flesh, that we may be filled? Job. 31.

My flesh is truly meat. John. 6.

When he had loved his who were in the World, he loved them unto the end. John.

CXXVIII. MED. Of the Holy Communion.
Ye Daughters of Jerusalem,
Tell my well beloved,
That I expect her day and night:
And that I languish with love.
I quitted Heaven, for to com down on Earth.
And for to gain her love,
I took the form of Bread,
To make my self be loved,
And eaten without horror.
I made my self a food, that I might unite
My self strictly to this ungrateful Soul.
I would fain feed her: I would enrich her
With the treasure of my Graces.
Why does she slight me?
Why does she fly me?
O ye Daughters, etc.
I am Bread, and not Poison.
I would make her live, and not make her die.
It was for to be loved, that I took this shape.
'Twas for to be eaten,
That I made my self Bread,
And not for to be admired.
It is to sanctify her Body,
That I give her my Flesh.
It Is for to enliven her Soul,
That I give her my Spirit.
It Is for to unite her to my Divinity,
That I give her my humanity.
As wise as I am,
I know not what more to give her.
As rich as I am, I have no more to give her.
As powerful as I am, I can give her no more.
Why then does she sly me?
Why does she fear me?
O ye Daughters, etc.
I have been at infinite Charges,
For to prepare this Banquet.
I have spared nothing for to content her.
I give her my Body to be eaten.
I give my blood to be drunk.
I heap up my graces on her.
I enrich her with my Merits.
I fill her with my Virtues.
I invite all the World to my Feast.
The sick for to cure them.
The weak for to fortify them.
The blind for to give them sight.
The sad for to comfort them.
Sinners for to sanctify them.
What reason has she to apprehend?
I do not require the end of the Sacrament,
For a disposition necessary to this Sacrament.
O ye Daughters of Jerusalem,
Tell my well-beloved,
That I expect her day and night,
And that she makes me languish with Love.
Tell her that she will die with hunger,
Unless she eats this Bread.
That she will have no grace,
Unless she eats at my Table.
That she will have no strength: no life:
No health: no comfort:
That she will be strongly tempted:
That she will sink under that temptation,
Unless she eat at my Table.
That if she excuses her self from coming,
She shall not taste of my Meats:
Neither in her life time, nor at her death.
Neither in Heaven, nor on Earth.
That I will give her place,
To the Blind and to the Lame.
That she contemns me,
Instead of honoring me.
That she afflicts me,
Instead of comforting me.
That she offends me,
Instead of contenting me.
O Bread of Angels,
Who came down from Heaven!
Shall I dare make thee com down into my heart?
Can I receive thee, knowing who I am?
Can I refuse thee, knowing who thou art?
Can I approach thee, knowing thy Sanctity?
Can I draw off, without necessity?
O Divine Lover!
Who do invite us to thy Wedding,
And who do invite us so lovingly.
Give a Nuptial Robe to this Prodigal Penitent.
I do not deserve this honor.
I am unworthy of this favor.
But the sentiment of my humility
Will supply the want of my sanctity.
You will have it so.
You desire it.
You order it.
You command it.
You threaten me with your anger,
If I fail to be present at it.
It Is better to side with Love than Fear.
Obedience is surer than Diffidence.
I will therefore approach with Respect.
I will receive you with Confidence.
I will embrace you with Love.
I will thank you with Tenderness.
I will eat you with Pleasure.
I will speak to you with Liberty.
I will serve you with Fidelity.
I will bless you in time, and in Eternity. Amen.
With desire have I desired to eat this Pasch with you before I suffer. Luke 22.

He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, remains in me, and I in him. John.
6.

A certain man made a great Supper, and called many, and they all began to
excuse themselves. Luke 14.

I say to you, that none of those men, that were called, shall taste my Supper.
Bring in hither the poor and weak, and blind and lame, force them to com in,
etc. ibid.

CXXIX. MED. In Form of Prayer to our Lord Jesus Christ: which may serve for a

In Time and Eternity. Amen.
You must pause at every verse, and relish that which shall touch your heart.

CXXX. MED. Of Devotion toward the B. Virgin.
FOr to be a Son of God's,
You must be the Son of Mary.
She is the Mother of all the just.
The Advocate of all sinners.
The Queen of all the Predestinate.
She brought them forth on Mount Calvary.
They were given to her at the foot of the Cross.
She has given life to all men,
In giving life to God.
She has co-operated to their Salvation,
In sacrificing him to his Father.
No man can go to the Father,
But by the Son:
Nor to the Son, but by the Mother.
The Father refuses nothing to his Son:
Nor the Son to his Mother.
I shall not be saved,
But by the Merits of the Son.
Nor shall I be saved,
But by the intercession of the Mother.
The Son is our Mediator with his Father.
The Mother is our Mediatrix with her Son.
JESUS is the Head of the Church,
Mary is the neck of the Church.
JESUS is the fountain of graces,
Mary is the basin of them.
JESUS is the Sun of the World,
Mary is the Moon thereof.
Nothing is produced in grace,
But by JESUS, and by Mary.
The Moon receives the whole Sun,
And contributes to the generation of Beings.
Mary receives all from JESUS,
And contributes to the sanctification of Souls.
O holy Mother of God! I begin to breath,
Because my salvation depends on you.
Your Son is my Savior,
But he is also my Judge.
His Goodness encourages me,
But his Justice affrightens me.
I am a Criminal,
I dare not appear before him.
But you my dear Mother,
You have nothing to frighten me.
You are a Mother of Grace, and not of Justice.
You became a Mother
Only for to give us a Savior.
You would not have been the Mother of God,
If there had been no Sinners.
O, I will be your child,
That I may be God's child.
O, I will be your servant,
That I may be God's servant.
He says to his Mother, Woman, behold your Son: Then he says to his Disciple,
Behold thy Mother. And from that hour the Disciple received her for his. John.

Dwell in Jacob, and have thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my Elect.
Eccl. 24.

He that shall find me, shall find life, and draw salvation from our Lord.
Prove. 8.

CXXXI. MED. Of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin.
MAry is happy,
In having been conceived without sin.
Mary is more happy,
In never having committed any sin.
It Is a misery for us to have contracted sin.
It Is a greater misery to have committed it.
Mary has always suffered,
Although she never sinned.
I sin continually,
And I would suffer nothing.
Mary is Innocent,
And is treated as a Criminal.
I am a Criminal,
And I would be treated as Innocent.
Mary's first grace
Is the foundation of her happiness.
She co-operated with it all her life long,
By an inviolable fidelity.
There are some graces in ones life time,
Which are the beginnings of our happiness.
There are somains in ones life time,
Which are the beginnings of our misery.
Cooperate with all graces. Avoid all sins.
Dread scandalous sins; they are pestilent sins,
Which are communicated unto others.
Fear contagious ones, which corrupt nature.
O Holy Mother of God!
How beautiful are you, and how pure are you.
There is no stain in you.
If my Conception is not immaculate,
At least make my life to be so.
If I have contracted original sin,
Make me avoid actual sin.
Let your Son, seeing my Soul at my death, say,
Thou art my well beloved,
There is no spot in thee.
Who shall declare her generation? Isai. 53.

Thou art all fair, my friend, and there is no spot in thee. Cant. 4.

Our Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways. Prove. 8.

It Is a great work: for a habitation is prepared, not for man, but for God. 2
Paral. 29.

Holiness becoms thy house: O Lord, for length of days. Ps 92.

CXXXII. MED. Of the Purification of the B. Virgin.
MAry is the Mother of God,
And she passes for the Mother of a man.
O what Humility!
Mary is pure like the Sun,
And yet she comes to the Temple to be purified.
O what Purity!
Mary is not subject to the Law,
And yet she submits her self voluntarily to it.
O what Obedience!
Mary has but one Son, who is most dear to her,
And yet she sacrifices him to God in the Temple.
O what Charity!
Imitate these virtues of Mary's.
Have an humble heart like her.
Have a pure body like her.
Have an obedient spirit like her.
Have liberal hands like her.
Offer up to God, what you have dearest to you.
Sanctify to him your Children,
Your desires, your thoughts.
Give him your heart,
That is your only one, and first born.
Go to the Temple, like Simeon:
Receive Jesus into your arms,
By the Priest's hands.
Sing with him that Canticle of love:
Now thou do dismiss thy servant, O Lord,
According to thy word in peace.
Because my eyes have seen thy Salvation,
Which thou have prepared before the face of all People,
A light to the revelation of Gentiles,
And the glory of thy People of Israel.
You will live in Peace,
If you desire nothing but Jesus.
You will die in Peace,
If you love nothing but Jesus.
Beg of Mary to take you into her arms,
And to offer you up to her Son,
At the end of your life.
She will do it, if you be her child:
If you be humble: chaste: charitable: like her.
O Mother of God!
Disdain not to be the Mother of a sinner.
I recommend my Soul into your hands.
It Is the price of your Son's blood.
Can you slight him? Can you reject him?
Since you have presented the head,
You ought also to present the members.
God cannot refuse what you offer him.
My salvation is secure, if it be in your hands.
O JESUS!
I recommend my spirit unto you.
I put my salvation into your hands.
Let me go out of this World in peace;
For I have seen all that I have to see.
My sins do disturb me.
O Lord I am thy Servant,
And the Son of thy Handmaid.
Can you damn your Mother's Child?
Can you hate him whom she loved?
They carried him into Jerusalem, to present him to our Lord. Luke 2.

Take thy only begotten Son Isaac, etc. and there thou shall offer him in a
Holocaust. Genesis 22.

In the simplicity of my heart, I joyfully offered all these things. 1 Paral.
29.

Now thou do dismiss thy servant, O Lord. Luke 2.

O Lord I am thy servant, and the Son of thy handmaid. Ps. 115.

CXXXIII. MED. Of the Annunciation of the B. Virgin.
It Is a great virtue to be little in grandeur.
It Is a rare virtue to be humble in honor.
Mary is the Mother of God,
Because she was his handmaid.
Mary takes the title of handmaid,
When she is qualified the Mother of God.
How happy is she for having conceived
The Word of God in her body;
But she is more happy,
For having conceived it in her soul.
She conceived him in her heart,
Before she conceived him in her womb.
The spiritual Conception of God,
Is more honorable to her than the corporal.
The one makes her the Mother of God,
The other makes her the worthy Mother of God.
Make your self the Mother of our Lord,
By doing the Will of his Father.
Conceive him by Faith.
Bring him forth by Charity.
Be his Brother by Believing.
Be his Mother by Preaching.
Renew by Communion,
The Mystery of the Incarnation.
Be you humble and obedient as she was,
And the Holy Chost will com down on you.
Be our Lord's Handmaid,
And you will become his Mother.
O most worthy Mother of God!
Disdain not to own for your Son, him,
Whom your Son vouchsafes to own for his brother.
If you are the Mother of God,
You must be the Mother of men.
It was for to be the Mother of men,
That you became the Mother of God.
You have two Breasts full of Milk:
Give one to your Son,
But keep the other for me.
Give one to the just,
But keep the other for sinners.
Behold the handmaid of our Lord, be it don unto me according to thy Word. Luke
1.

Whosoever shall do the Will of my Father, who is in Heaven, he is my brother,
and sister, and mother. Matthew. 12.

He is not ashamed to call them brothers. Heb. 2.

The Holy Ghost shall com down on thee, and the virtue of the highest shall
over-shadow thee. Luke 1.

CXXXIV. MED. Of the Humiliations of the Son of God, and the Elevations of
Mary, in the Mystery of the Incarnation.
JESUS of a God, was made man.
Of a Lord, he was made a slave.
Of Omnipotent, he was made weak.
Of rich, he was made poon.
JESUS by making himself man,
Made Mary the Mother of God.
JESUS by making himself a slave,
Made Mary the Mistress of God.
JESUS by making himself weak,
Has given unto Mary the Power of God.
JESUS by making himself poor,
Has given unto Mary the Treasures of God.
JESUS cannot descend lower than he descended.
Mary cannot ascend higher than she ascended.
There is nothing that is above Jesus.
There is nothing but God above Mary.
All that is not God, is below Jesus.
All that is not God, is below Mary.
Rejoice in these her grandures.
Choose her for your Mother.
Acknowledge her for your Queen.
Take her for your Advocate.
Obey her, whom God himself has obeyed.
Serve her, whom God has served.
Love her, whom God has loved.
Salute her, whom the Angel did salute.
Say to her often with heart and mouth,
Hail full of Grace.
Give us a part of your fullness.
Our Lord is with thee.
As Father, as Son, as Spouse.
Blessed art thou among Women,
With infinite blessings.
Thou alone art a Virgin and a Mother.
Thou alone were conceived without Crime.
Thou alone did live without Sin.
Thou alone did die without Pain.
Thou alone had God for thy Son and Subject.
Thou alone art his Daughter, his Mother, his Spouse.
Thou art the repairer of the World.
The Queen of the Universe.
The Gate of Paradise.
The Dispenser of Graces.
O Blessed Virgin, give me thy blessing!
And blessed be the Fruit, which thou gave to the World.
Most holy Mary, and most worthy Mother of God.
Pray for the Just: and for Sinners,
Now, that thou see them
Beaten by so many Temptations:
Slaves to so many vices:
Overwhelmed with so many miseries;
But especially at their Death,
When their Salvation is in greatest danger,
And thy succor will be most necessary for them.
The Word was made flesh. John. 1.

You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for you he was made poor,
whereas he was rich: that by his poverty you might be rich. 2 Cor. 3.

All generations shall call me blessed. Luke 2.

CXXXV. MED. Of the Visitation of the B. Virgin.
JESUS visits S. John.
Mary visits S. Elizabeth.
Jesus sanctifies both the Mother, and the Son
By the mouth of Mary.
As soon as ever she had spoken
John Baptist was sanctified.
Her speech was a Conduit-pipe of grace,
which gave sight to a blind man,
Which delivered a captive,
Which raised up one that was dead,
Which justified a sinner.
Mary applies to the first amongst men,
The first fruit of our Redemption.
She conceives man spiritually,
After having conceived God corporally.
She becoms the Mother of men,
After having become the Mother of God.
She is the Mother of grace.
She is the Mother of mercy.
Of grace for the just: Of mercy for sinners.
O Mother of grace! Mother of mercy!
Visit us frequently together with thy Son.
You want not grace,
Since you have the fullness thereof.
You want not mercy,
Since it dwelt nine months in your bowels.
Exercise it on a poor blind man,
And on a poor captive:
On a sinner: a slave to his Passions:
On one dead to the life of grace.
Com, and enlighten, and enlarge him:
Com, and raise him, and sanctify him.
Make thy voice to be heard to the ear of my heart;
For thy voice is sweet,
And thy beauty incomparable.
Speak: and my heart will leap with joy.
Say the word, and my soul will be healed:
For you have in you the Word of God.
Which gives life to the World.
Mary Mother of grace! Mother of mercy!
Defend us from our Enemies,
And receive our Souls at the hour of our Death.
For to honor the Virgin,
You must imitate her Virtues.
Love Solitude as she did.
Go not out of it, but for to do good.
Visit the Prisoners. Help the Miserable.
Deliver Captives. Sanctify Sinners.
Be a Mother of grace to their Souls:
A Mother of mercy to their Bodies.
Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, because he has visited, etc. Luke 1.

Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which he visited us. ibid.

Visit us in thy salvation. Ps. 205.

voice is sweet, and thy face comely. Cant. 2.

CXXXVI. MED. Of the Death of the B. Virgin.
WHat is it that makes the Chalice of Death bitter?
It is the loss of the World.
It Is the separation from the Body.
It Is the account that is to be given.
We feel sadness, in quitting the World.
We feel pain, in quitting our Body.
We dread, being to appear before God.
Mary died without Fear: Sadness: Pain.
Because she lived without Sin: ty: Pleasure.
O let my soul die with the death of the Saints!
O let my death be like the death of Mary!
Live the life of Saints,
And thou will die the death of Saints.
Live like Mary, and thou will die like Mary.
Live without sin, and thou will die without fear.
Live without ty: and thou will die without sadness.
Live without pleasure,
And thou will die without pain:
If you lead the life of sinners,
You will die the death of sinners.
If you live in disorder,
You will die in confusion.
If you live in sin, you will die in fear.
If you live in pleasure,
You will die in pain.
That which makes your delight, during your life,
Will make your torment at your death.
That which is your pain, during your life,
Will be your pleasure at your death.
O Holy Virgin!
I care not by what death I die,
Provided that I die in a good state.
I shall die without fear, if I die in your arms.
I shall die in grace, if I die in your service:
For you save those that belong to you.
You never suffer your Children to perish.
O fail not to be present at your Son's death!
All the Predestinate must die in your arms,
Since you saw the first Predestinate die.
I will disengage my self from the World,
That I may die without sadness.
I will afflict my Body,
That I may die without pain.
I will abstain from sin,
That I may die without fear.
I will live in pain, that I may die in pleasure.
I will live in Penance,
That I may die with assurance.
I will live in Charity,
That I may die in Sanctity.
I will live a Child of the Virgins,
That I may die like a Predestinate.
I will live in grace, that I may die in grace.
I will live in love, that I may die in love.
I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, that if you find my beloved, you
will tell him, that I languish with love. Cant. 5.

He shall laugh at the latter day. Prove. 31.

Into thy hands, O Lord, I recommend my spirit. Luke 23.

CXXXVII. MED. Of the Resurrection of the B. Virgin.
MAry is risen again.
Her body is no longer in the grave.
So pure a flesh as hers,
Ought to be exempt from corruption.
So holy a Temple, ought not to be profaned.
Mary is the chastest of Virgins:
She ought therefore to be incorruptible
Mary is the best of Mothers,
She ought therefore to be with her Son.
If the body of Jesus, by its Communion,
Gives a right to a Resurrection:
Who ought to rise again,
If not she who gave him flesh?
If the Servants are with their Masters,
Where ought his Mother to be?
If this favor is don to the Slaves,
Who will dispute it to the Queen?
If her body be not risen again,
How coms it to be hid?
Why is it not honored?
Every one shall reap, what he has sowed.
Those who sow in the Flesh, reap Corruption.
Those who sow in Spirit, reap Incorruption.
Mary was laid into the ground,
But she did not remain there.
Her flesh did enclose a germ of life,
Which made her revive and rise again.
She was buried:
That she might imitate her Son:
That she might visit Purgatory:
That she might sanctify our Earth,
For to give an assurance of her death.
But she ought to return to life again,
For to give an assurance of our Resurrection.
There would one Ornament be wanting in Heaven,
If the Body of Mary were not there.
O my glorious Princess!
I have a horror to think that your body,
The holiest of all bodies,
Should rot, and be eaten by the Worms.
That your immaculate flesh,
Should not be risen again.
That you should be a slave to death:
You who did destroy its Empire.
It was requisite, that one Man should rise again,
For to give assurance of the Resurrection of Men.
It was requisite, that one Woman should rise again,
For to assure the Resurrection of Women.
O how amiable is Purity!
O how detestable is Impurity!
Why should we prepare meat for Worms?
Why should we adore that flesh,
Which will soon be devoured by Beasts?
Unless the Victim be salted, it will rot:
Unless the Flesh be mortified, it will corrupt.
Thou will not leave my soul in Hell, nor will thou give thy holy one to see
corruption. Ps. 15.

I have slept, and been at rest, and have risen up, because our Lord has taken
me. Ps. 3.

Father, those that thou have given me: I will have them to be where I am.
John. 17.

He that sows in his own flesh, of flesh he shall reap corruption: but he that
sows in spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting. Gal. 6.

Com from Libanus my Spouse, and thou shall be crowned. Cant. 5.

CXXXVIII. MED. Of the Assumption of the B. Virgin.
WHo is this Princess that ascends up to Heaven,
Leaning upon her well beloved?
It Is Mary the Mother of God.
As she was the purest of all Creatures,
She ought to be above all the Heavens.
As she was the most humbled,
So she ought to be the most elevated.
As she received the most graces,
So she ought to receive the greatest glory.
As she was the nearest related to God,
So she ought to com the nearest to him.
As she suffered without measure.
So she ought to be comforted beyond measure.
The Divine Solomon
Has made his Mother sit upon his Throne.
He has associated her to his Empire.
He has established her Queen of the Universe.
He has subjected all Creatures to her.
The Father has crowned her with Power.
The Son has crowned her with Wisdom.
The Holy Ghost has crowned her with Sanctity.
Jesus is our Mediator with the Father,
Mary is our Mediatrix with the Son.
Jesus appeases the wrath of his Father,
Mary appeases the wrath of her Son.
Jesus shows his wounds to his Father,
Mary shows her breasts to her Son.
Who will despair of his Salvation,
Having such Intercessours with God?
Mary loves sinners, because her Son loved them.
Because for them it was that he came into the World.
Because they are miserable:
Because without them,
She would not have been the Mother of God.
Because it is for them that she is the Mother of God.
Go my Holy Mother!
Go and reap the fruits of your long labors.
Go, Ark of our Lord, and rest in the Temple of glory.
There it is that a Throne is set up for you.
There you are to be crowned by the Holy Trinity.
O how I am ravished to see you ascend to Heaven,
With so much pomp and magnificence!
O ye Angels of Heaven!
Open the gates to the Mother of God.
Com and meet your Princess.
Render your respects to her,
Carry her up to the very Throne of her Son.
O Queen of Heaven and Earth!
O Mother of grace of mercy!
My life and my hopes after God!
I salute you and honor you,
On the Throne of glory, to which God has raised you.
O you are now in the Haven,
Whilst we are yet beaten with storms.
You are now in your Country,
And we are yet in banishment.
You are in security, and we are in danger.
O our dear Mother!
O our powerful Advocate!
Cast your eyes upon us, your poor Children,
Who weep and sigh in this vale of misery:
Take care of their Salvation:
And obtain the grace for them,
That after this Exil, they may see
Your beloved Son in Heaven. Amen. So be it.
Com from Libanus, and thou shall be crowned. Cant. 4.

Who is she that ascends from the Desert flowing in delights, leaning on her
beloved? Cant. 8.

the King said to her; Ask Mother, for it is not lawful for me to turn away my
face. 3 Kings. 2.

CXXXIX. MED. Of the Nativity of the B. Virgin: and of the Name of Mary given
to her.
THe Birth of Mary, is a Work above nature:
But, for the good of nature.
Her Nobility, ought to make her to be honored.
Her benefits ought to make her to be desired.
Her beauty ought to make her be loved.
The Name of Mary which was given to her,
Rejoices the Angels: Comforts men:
Makes the Devils tremble.
After the Name of Jesus,
There is none sweeter, than that of Mary.
None more powerful, than that of Mary.
He that says Mary, says a powerful Lady:
And a Sea of bitterness.
She is a Lady,
Because she was a Handmaid.
She is a Sea of comfort,
Because she was a Sea of bitterness.
Have you a mind to command,
You must obey.
Have you a mind to be comforted,
You must suffer.
O most holy Virgin!
I will drink in the Chalice of your affliction,
That I may drink in that of your comfort.
I will obey as you did,
That I may one day reign with you.
O great Princess!
I rejoice in your Birth,
As in the principle of my life, and my salvation.
I salute you in your Cradle,
As in the Throne of Grace and Innocence.
You came not into the World
Laden with chains, as we did.
The Sun saw you crowned as soon as born,
But it sees us damned, e're we are born.
O Queen of Heaven and Earth!
I choose you for my Lady,
My Mother, and Advocate.
I will serve you as my Lady.
I will love you as my Mother.
I will invocate you as my Advocate.
My holy Lady, take me into your protection.
My holy Mother, give me your blessing.
My holy Advocate, grant me your intercession.
Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou the joy of Israel, thou the honor of
our People. Judith. 25.

He shall comfort us from all the works and labors of our hands, in the land

CXL. MED. Of the Presentation of the B. Virgin in the Temple.
MAry offered up unto God all that she had.
She offered it up as soon as she could.
She offered it up with a full will, for ever,
And by an irrevocable promise.
We give to God but half our heart.
We give it as late as we can.
We give it with regret.
We give it but for a time.
Give all. Give quickly.
Give cheerfully. Give for ever.
O Holy Virgin!
I give my self wholly to you without reserve.
I give my self with all my heart.
I am sorry that I gave my self so late.
I give my self for ever,
And by an irrevocable donation.
Offer up my heart to your Son.
I give it to him all entire: without delay:
Without regret: without return: for ever:
And by an irrevocable donation.
It Is good for a man, when he has born the yoke from his youth, he shall sit
solitary, and shall be silent, because he has raised himself above himself.

A Protestation of Service to the B. Virgin, which ought to be made on all
Holy Days and Communion Days.
O Holy Virgin, most worthy Mother of God, although I know my self unworthy to be
in the number of your Servants, and of your Children; yet trusting in your
goodness, and in your mercy, and pushed on with a desire of serving you: I
declare in the Presence of God, and of all the Heavenly Court, that I choose
you this day for my Queen, for my Mother, and for my Advocate: And I make a
firm resolution never to forsake your Service: never to do or say any thing
against your honor: and never to permit that any that depend upon me ever
offend you, or dishonor you in any manner whatsoever. I most humbly beseech
you to receive me into the number of your Servants, and of your Children; to
help me in all my Necessities, and not to forsake me at the hour of my Death.
Amen.

I thought my self obliged to make this Form, for those, who know not the
manner how to give themselves to the B. Virgin.

The End of the Third Part.
THE FOURTH PART. FOR THE VNITIVE LIFE.
CXLI. MED. Of the Love of JESUS.
JESUS is the most beautiful of all Men.
JESUS is the greatest of all Kings.
JESUS is the most charitable of all Fathers.
JESUS is the most faithful of all Friends.
JESUS is the mildest of all Masters.
JESUS is the perfectest of all Spouses.
JESUS made himself man for me, and like me.
JESUS made himself poor for me, and like me.
JESUS made himself miserable for me, and like me.
JESUS suffered death for me, and like me.
JESUS is my Father, and my King.
He is my Brother, and my Spouse.
My Master, and my Shepherd.
My Chief, and my Physician.
My Salvation, and my Redemption.
My Hopes, and my Comfort.
JESUS loves me with all his heart.
He is always at the door of my heart.
He entreats me to give him my heart.
He has given his life to have my heart.
I am ungrateful if I refuse him my heart.
Woe unto him, who divides his heart.
Cursed is he that loves him not with all his heart.
O Love of all Loves!
O Heart of all Hearts!
Let me love you, as you love me.
Let me love you, as you deserve to be loved.
Nothing above JESUS.
Nothing comparable to JESUS.
Nothing with JESUS.
Nothing after JESUS.
Goodly of beauty above the Sons of men. Ps. 44.

All in all Christ. Col. 3.

Simon of John, do thou love me? John. 14.

He that has my Commandments and keeps them, it is he that loves me. John. 14.

If any one does not love our Lord Jesus Christ, be he Anathema. 1 Cor. 16.

CXLII. MED. Of the Unity of Love.
LOve comes from Unity: tends to Unity:
Reposes in Unity: conserves it self by Unity.
A strait heart cannot be bowed.
A pure heart cannot be stained.
A free heart cannot be captivated.
A single heart cannot be divided.
Woe unto those that have a double heart.
God's heart cannot love them.
No man can have two Heavens.
No man can serve two Masters.
No man can have two Spouses.
No man can love God and the World.
There must be but one Soul to one Body.
But one Sun to the Universe.
But one King in a State.
But one Governor in a Place.
But one Shepherd to one Flock.
But one Pilot to one Ship.
But one Love to one Heart.
But one God to one Creature.
You will, say you, give God half your heart.
Ah! did not God create the other half?
Did God redeem but half your heart?
Will God save but half your heart?
Did God give you but half his heart?
Ah! why will you give him but half of yours?
Is the heart of a man too much for God?
O the God of my Heart!
You have always been mine,
And I have never been yours.
I have made to my self as many Idols,
As I have loved Creatures.
I have divided my Faith,
When I divided my Charity.
I destroyed both the one and the other,
When I divided them.
Ah! I lost my self, when I did not love you.
I will henceforth, O my God,
Love you with all my heart.
I will never more divide my affections.
All to all. One to one. One alone to one alone.
This is the Device of my heart,
O my God, and my All.
Since you have given me your whole heart,
Which is so great:
It Is very just that I should give you all mine,
That is so small.
No man can serve two Masters. Matthew. 6.

Thou shall love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart. Matthew. 22.

How long do you halt on both sides? if our Lord is God, serve him, etc. 3
Kings. 18.

Woe unto the double hearted. Eccl. 2.

Their heart is divided, now they will perish. Os. 10.

CXLIII. MED. Of the Presence of God.
GOD is before me: with me: in me:
He is before me, for to consider me.
He is with me, for to govern me.
He is in me, for to enliven me.
I ought therefore to be before God,
By thinking on nothing but him.
With God, by laboring only for him.
In God, by loving nothing but him.
I am never alone: God is always with me.
I never work alone: God always works with me.
I never suffer alone: God always suffers with me.
Is it not to be in Heaven, to see God always?
Is it not to be in Hell, never to see God?
Alas my God!
You always think on me;
And I never think on you.
You are always with me,
And I am never with you.
You always labor for me,
And I never labor for you.
You are always in me, as in a Hell,
There to see my Crimes,
And hear my Blasphemies.
You shall henceforth be as in a Heaven,
There to see good actions, and hear your praises,
Lord thou have tried me and known me; whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or
fly from thy face? Ps. 138.

But thou art in us, O Lord. Jer. 4.

The God of Hosts in whose sight I stand. 4 Kings. 3.

CXLIV. MED. Of Solitude.
IT is hard to be with God, and with men.
You must avoid company, to enjoy your beloved.
The World makes too much noise about your heart,
For to hear his speech.
He is not to be seen but in the Desert,
And in the sleep of the Senses,
And in the silence of the Passions.
Be solitary in body: in mind: in heart.
God visits you when you are solitary in body.
God speaks to you when you are solitary in mind.
God fills you when you are solitary in heart.
Unless you draw off from Creatures,
God cannot visit you.
Unless you make Creatures hold their peace,
God cannot speak to you.
Unless you disengage your self from Creatures;
God cannot love you.
O Solitude of body! of mind! of heart!
It Is with you that God is seen, heard, and tasted.
Let us go into Solitude, my beloved,
There it is that I will speak to the heart.
I will lead her into solitude, and speak to her heart. Os. 2.

Our Lord is not in commotion. 3 Kings. 19.

The woman fled into the wilderness. Apoc. 12.

When you pray, enter into your chamber. Matthew. 6.

Through the places and the streets, I will seek whom my soul loves: I sought
him, but did not find him. Cant. 3.

CXLV. MED. Of the leaving of our selves.
HAppy is the man that puts his trust in God.
Who leaves himself to his Providence:
Who suffers himself to be guided by his Wisdom.
Who rests upon his Goodness.
Nothing disturbs that Soul that is left to God.
Nothing opposes it self to her desires.
All things happen out as she would have them:
All is don as she desires,
Because she desires nothing,
But as God would have it.
She sleeps amidst Storms.
She is calm in Persecutions.
She labors without solicitude.
She does all things without disquiet.
God is her Vessel, and her Pilot.
Her Chariot, and her Driver.
Her Father, and her Protector.
Her Safeguard, and her Defense.
She reposes betwixt his arms.
She lays her heart upon his.
She has no care, but to please him,
She thinks on nothing, but of contenting him.
She recommends her spirit to him.
And then she dies to all her fears,
And to all her desires;
But God watches, when she sleeps.
He works, when she reposes.
He conducts her in her Journeys.
He carries her in her feebleness.
He hears her in her prayers.
He prevents all her desires.
He concerns himself in all her affairs.
He blesses all her designs.
He provides for all her necessities.
He cures all her ailings.
He sweetens all her bitternesses.
He allays all her sorrows.
My Child, says our Lord,
Think on me, and I will think on thee.
Do my Will, and I will do thine.
Do my affairs as thy own,
And I will do thine as my own.
Remain in quiet, and desire nothing.
Give me thy heart,
And I will give thee mine.
Blessed is the man that hopes in him. Ps. 34.

Whatsoever befalls the just man will not sadden him. Prove. 12.

You shall sleep in sorrows. Isai. 50.

He that fears our Lord, shall dread nothing, and shall not be afraid, because
he is his hope. Eccl. 34.

To thee is the poor man left, thou shall be a helper to the orphan. Ps. 9.

I know whom I have trusted, and I am certain that he is able to keep my
depositum unto that day. 2 Timothy 1.

CXLVI. MED. How we ought to leave our selves.
I Know not whether I lose my self.
I know not whether I save my self.
Whether I do well, or ill.
Whether I go forward, or backward.
I know not what to say, or think.
In this confusion of my thoughts,
I say to you, without troubling my self,
My God, I leave my self to you.
My Friends betray me.
My Enemies persecute me.
I am wasted in sorrows.
I am reduced to necessity.
I am stripped of my goods.
I am blackned with calumnies.
I find no body to comfort me.
I have no gust at all in my Devotions.
My temptations increase.
My forces diminish.
My lights are eclipsed.
I know not what will become of me.
I am heart-less and support-less.
All my comfort in my pains,
Is to lose my self, and to say to you,
My God, I leave my self to you.
Am I in grace? or am I in sin?
Am I worthy of hatred, or of love?
Shall I be saved? shall I be damned?
Shall I go to Heaven? or go to Hell?
All this is unknown to me;
But nothing of this disturbs me.
I put my confidence in God.
I rest upon his mercy.
I rely upon the merits of his Son.
I recommend my Spirit to him.
I am in peace, when I have said to him,
My God, I leave my self to you.
Let me live. Let me die.
Let me die soon. Let me live long.
Let me be well. Let me be sick.
Let me be comforted. Let me be afflicted.
Let me be in peace. Let me be in war.
All this is indifferent to me.
Your good pleasure is mine.
Your will makes my joy.
I have but one thing to desire,
Which is to please you, and to love you.
You are my Love, and my All.
My God, I leave my self to you.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit, thou have redeemed me, O God of truth. Ps.
30.

In peace in the self same, I will sleep and rest. Ps. 4.

I am a beggar and poor, our Lord is sollicitous for me. Ps. 74.

I am become like a lost Vessel. Ps. 30.

He said, I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee. Heb. 13.

CXLVII. MED. Of Annihilation.
A Being made us to com forth from God.
A not being makes us return to God.
Until a Soul has found her Nothing,
She cannot find God.
He is hid under the Creatures,
As under veils and shapes.
As soon as you penetrate into the inside,
You see God openly.
For to know all; you must know nothing.
For to taste all; you must taste nothing.
For to have all; you must have nothing.
For to be all; you must be nothing.
O my God!
You are my All; I am nothing.
You are my light; I know nothing.
You are my strength; I can do nothing.
You are my virtue; I do nothing.
Speak, my God, for your Servant hears.
My mouth, before you, is speechless.
You know what my heart says to you.
O blessed Soul!
Which listens to God in the silence from all Discourses.
Be silent all human and carnal thoughts.

ONe ought to be a Traveller on Earth.
One ought to be crucified.
One ought to die on the Cross.
One ought to be buried.
One ought to go down into Hell.
A Traveller fixes upon nothing.
He that is crucified, acts nothing.
A dead man feels nothing.
The body that is under ground is trampled on.
In Hell one is without comfort.
O Sacred Nothing!
Where the Soul loses her Being,
For to be transformed into God.
O living Sepulchers!
Where the wise do build Solitudes to themselves.
O Evangelical field!
Wherein the grain of Wheat dies for to rise again.
O God alone!
How amiable art thou?
I had rather be in Hell with thee,
Than be in Heaven without thee.
O let me be one of those living dead,
Who are wounded with love!
Let me sleep with them in the Tomb
Of my Senses and Passions.
O my God!
Let me die, that thou may live in me.
Let me no more be any thing to my self,
That I may be all thine.
Be thou all in me: all mine.
And if I may be so bold as to say so,
All my self.
My dearest, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to refrain your selves
from carnal desires. 1 Pet. 2.

Why is not my heart all yours,
Since you are all his?
O ravishing Beauty! O infinite Goodness!
When shall it be, that I shall love you?
When shall it be, that I shall see you?
Since one must die for to see you,
It is just, for to have this good,
That I should die an infinity of times.

What favors has God don to me?
From what danger has he preserved me?
From how many evils has he delivered me?
What great goods he promises me?
Who deserves my heart better than he?
Who offers me a greater price for to have it?
To whom shall I give it, if not to him,
Who has given me his?
To whom shall I sell it, if not to him,
Who has bought it at the price of his Blood?
Is a naughty heart worth the blood of a God?
Worth the life of a God?
Worth the heart of a God?
Worth the Kingdom of God?
I deserve not to live,
If I will live for any one but you.
I ought not to have a heart,
If I will love any thing else besides you.
O I have loved you too late.
Beauty always new, always ancient!
O I have too soon offended you,
Bounty always amiable, always adorable!

I will never offend you, O God of majesty.

CLII. MED. Of the Incomprehensibility of God.
ALL times together
Cannot measure the Being of God.
All places together cannot enclose him.
All understandings whatsoever
Cannot comprehend him.
All hearts together
Cannot love him sufficiently.
God is nothing of what I see.
He is nothing of what I touch.
He is nothing of what I hear.
He is nothing of what I know.
He is nothing of what I imagine.
He is an invisible, spiritual,
And incomprehensible Being.

CLIII. MED. Of Simplicity.
BE simple in mind. Be simple in heart.
That Spirit is simple,
That has but one thought.
That heart is simple, that has but one desire.
Without these two Simplicities
You will never arrive to Unity.
God is a pure Act.
There is nothing more simple than his Being.
He cannot be multiplied.
He cannot endure Duplicity.
He has from all Eternity,
But one thought and one love.
He says all in one word.
And this word is nothing but Truth.
If you would unite your self to God,
You must imitate this Simplicity.
To what purpose are so many thoughts?
To what end so many discourses?
Are not you convinced of the truth?
Why should you seek after what you have found?
Do what you know. Taste what you see.
God is one great Word.
A great matter for Prayer.
Cast your self into this Ocean.
Plunge your self into this Abyss.
You will find all things in God.
You will find nothing out of God.
Martha, you labor too much.
Your Sollicitudes are unprofitable.
Here is too much meat,
For the Word, whom you would treat.
What need so many cares?
One thing alone is sufficient.
Imitate your Sister Magdalen.
She has chosen the better part.
She hearkens, without speaking.
She reposes, without disquieting her self.
She has an extreme satisfaction,
To be in the presence of her beloved.
Draw your self out of multiplicity.
Draw near unto Unity.
This is the only thing necessary.
There is nothing but this, that can content you.
For to have but one only thought,
You ought to have but one desire.
For to empty your self of your thoughts,
You must empty your self of your desires.
Without simplicity of heart,
You will never have simplicity of spirit.
You love a thousand things,
And you would think of nothing?
You give ear to your Passions,
And you complain of Distractions.
Your Complaints are not reasonable.
There is a duplicity in your heart.
It runs after its treasure.
It takes pleasure in what it loves.
It does not love God only.
You are not master of your own spirit.
But are not you master of your own heart?
You cannot be without a thought:
But cannot you be without a desire?
You will have but few evil thoughts,
If you have no evil desires.
Shut your self up into your heart:
There it is that you will find,
What it is that you love.
Whatever noise your Understanding makes,
Take heed you open not the door to it.
Stop its lightness. Mortify its curiosity.
And if you cannot compass this,
Let the Vagabond run:
But do not run after him.
Remain in your own quiet.
Wrap your self up in your Poverty.
What do you seek for, having God present?
Is not faith more certain than the senses?
It Is better to love, than to think.
Better to enjoy, than to desire.
You will enjoy your beloved,
When you love him, without desiring any thing.
O my Soul!
How happy would thou be,
If thou did content thy self with God?
If thou did seek only to please him.
If thou would nothing, but what he wills.
Thy heart in thy Prayer would be
Like a Stone in its Center.
Like the Flame in its Sphere.
Like a River in the Ocean.
Like a Needle that looks upon its Pole.
Like Iron that touches the Lodestone.
O my God! What would I have?
And what do I seek after?
What do I desire, and what do I expect?
Alas! I seek after rest,
And I am always in motion.
I would fain be in peace,
And I am always in war.
O I am weary of laboring!
I will henceforth rest my self.
I have but too much knowledge;
I will now begin to love.
Let us, O my Soul, taste and see
How sweet our Lord is.
O the God of my life! O the peace of my soul!
I have offered up all to you with joy,
In the simplicity of my heart.
You know what it is that I seek after.
What it is that I desire.
My heart is simple, O my God:
It has no double dealing.
Make it therefore to enter
Into the repose of the Saints,
And draw it to the center of Unity.
With the simple is his Communication. Prove. 3.

The simplicity of the just shall direct them. Prove. 11.

If thy eye be simple, all thy body will be lightsom. Matthew. 6.

O sweet words! My God and my All.
How savoury are they to a Soul,
Unto whom God is All:
And to whom All that is not God, is nothing.
O God and my All!
I am weary of thinking, reading, reasoning.
I find All in these two words,
My God, and my All.
All that I read, all that I hear,
Takes up my mind,
But it does not fill my heart.
I find every where a vacuity and indigence.
There is only You, in whom I find
The sum of all my desires,
O my God, and my All.
These two words are honey to my mouth;
A source of living water to my heart,
Which quenches its thirst.
Which contents all its desires.
What can I wish for after you?
Who can content me, if you cannot?
O my God and my All.
You shall henceforth be my All:
And all Creatures shall be nothing to me.
I said to our Lord, thou art my God, because thou do not want my goods. Ps.
15.

I will show thee all good. Exodus 33.

He that replenishes your desire in good things. Ps. 102.

What is there to me in Heaven, and what else but thee would I have on Earth, O
God of my heart. Ps. 72.

HEaven is the House of God.
It Is the Land of the living.
It Is the Center of rest.
It Is the Ocean of all goods.
It Is the Absence of all evils.
It Is the Source of all pleasures.
The Treasure of all riches.
The Throne of all grandures.
The End of all pains.
The Height of all comforts.
There you shall see, and you shall love.
There you shall possess, and enjoy.
There you shall have all that you desire,
And have nothing of what you fear.
There good shall be without evil.
Pleasure without pain.
Abundance without indigence.
Health without sickness.
Life without death.
Rest without disquiet.
O what satisfaction to see all that is beautiful!
To love all that is good.
To possess all that is great.
To taste all that is sweet.
To see the first Truth.
To possess the chief good.
To taste the chiefest pleasure.
O God of Virtues!
How amiable are your Tabernacles?
My Soul languishes with a desire
Of entering into your Heaven.
O how miserable am I here below!
O how happy shall I be there above!
My Soul!
If thou love the goods of this World,
Thou will not have the goods of Heaven.
O how the Earth displeases me,
When I lift up my eyes to Heaven.
My God!
Let me die quickly, that I may see you,
Since none can see you without dying.
I will show thee all good. Exodus 33.

We shall be filled with the goods of thy house. Ps. 64.

They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house: and thou will give them
to drink of the torrent of thy pleasure. Ps. 35.

God will wash away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more, nor
mourning, nor clamor, nor dolor. Apoc. 21.

Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man,
what God has prepared for those that love him. 1 Cor. 2.

CLVI. MED. Of Divine Union.
FOr to arrive to Union,
Much Mortification is necessary.
Much Recollection is requisite.
We must leave our selves to Providence.
We must permit our selves
To be conducted by obedience.
We must renounce our own judgment.
Destroy our own will.
Combat our own Passions.
Obey inspirations.
You cannot be with God, and with men.
Absent from your self, and present to your self.
In conversation, and in recollection:
Tied in heart, and free in mind.
Love all things, and think of nothing.
Die spiritually, and live sensually.
Action goes before contemplation.
Labor conducts to rest.
Fear sustains love.
Penance disposes to enjoyment.
Reason helps faith.
The humanity of JESUS,
Leads to his divinity.
A wise and discreet man,
Disposes in his heart certain steps.
The first is toward the heart.
The second is in the heart.
The third is from the heart.
The fourth is above the heart.
In the first we fear our Lord.
In the second we hearken to our Master.
In the third we desire our Spouse.
In the fourth we enjoy God.
We fear at the foot of Mount Sinai.
We see wonders in the middle of it.
We are blinded on the top of it.
We find God in darkness.
Moses, before he was called,
Did not dare to enter into the obscurity.
One favor of a visit does not found a state.
There are some graces, which attracts.
Some graces that are rewards.
The attracts do precede merit:
The rewards do crown merit.
The attracts are for a time.
The rewards are for always.
We must not reckon our selves secured,
For having seen JESUS once transfigured.
One must not think her self a Spouse,
For having been at the Wedding.
A Novice may enjoy God,
Without being in the state of enjoyment.
It Is a strange presumption,
To have a mind to be a Spouse,
Before she has been a Handmaid.
A Penitent may sometimes sing:
But his trade is to weep.
A Soul laden with wounds,
Does not need her Spouse, but a Physician.
She must seek after remedies,
And not ask for kisses.
When you have kisst his feet,
You may then kiss his hand.
When you have don good works,
You may then kiss his mouth.
O Lord, who would be so bold
As to ask that favor?
But who is it that would not desire it?
The Soul is instructed by Meditation,
She disengages her self by affection.
She makes her groans to break forth.
Then she dies to all her desires.
She loses the use of her speech.
She knows no longer what to say to God.
There is a silence made in her heart,
Which astonishes and surprises her.
A dreadful obscurity, robs her of her lights.
Her Imagination is without image.
Her Appetite without motion.
Her Understanding without discourse.
Her Memory without Species.
Her Passions without noise.
All is buried in Night.
When God from the bottom of the darkness:
Which covers the Mount Sinai,
Calls a Soul to his Palace:
She ought immediately to enter in.
The fire, and the Claps of Thunder,
The Lightnings and Precipices,
Will fill her with affrightments.
But as soon as ever she is entered,
God will engrave in her heart
A Law of love and of grace:
A Law of tenderness and sweetness:
He will crown her with brightness:
And will cause the rays of his Divinity
To be seen on her face.
It Is at midnight, the doors being shut,
That the Espouse enters into the heart.
There are performed the Nuptials of the Lamb.
There is nothing heard there,
But Canticles of joy.
The very senses have a share in the Feast.
Only the Understanding remains in amaze,
Finding it self excluded from the Nuptials.
And not knowing which way the Spouse came in.
The Heart only can tell it:
He knows, but cannot express it.
Happy are those who are called
To the Nuptials of this divine Lamb.
Happy are the dead in JESUS Christ.
Dead to the discourses of nature.
Dead to their cares, and their disquiets.
Dead to their sadnesses, and their pleasures.
Dead to their fears, and their desires.
They shall pass from Penance,
Into a state of enjoyment.
They shall see their labors followed,
With peace, sweetness, and infinite contentments.
Write: Blessed are the dead, that die in our Lord. Apoc. 14.

He puts darkness his covert. Ps. 17.

When Moses was gone up, etc. Exodus 24.

Behold the Spouse comes: those who were ready entered in with him, and the door
was shut. Matthew. 25.

A Prayer to the B. Trinity for to obtain the grace of Union.

You must make a Pause at every Verse, and relish that which touches your
heart.

I entered into an Ocean.
I plunged my self into these Abysses.
I lost my self happily.
I confounded my Being with that of God's.
I was in time,
And I believed I was in Eternity.
I was a Creature,
And I found my self united to the Divinity.
O mysterious and fortunate night!
Where God unites himself to our spirit,
In the silence of its desires and thoughts.
O how sweet is that hour, but how short.
Let all flesh be silent in the presence of our Lord.
VI. CANT.
I Am threatened with death.
I am encompassed with darkness.
Beaten with storms.
At the very gates of Hell.
But all this does not astonish me.
Love is stronger than death.
He makes his bed in darkness.
He sleeps in the midst of Storms.
He finds Heaven in Hell.
He carries his Heaven with him.
Because he has within himself
All that he desires.
He would have all things,
And would have nothing.
He possesses all things, and possesses nothing.
God is his treasure, and his felicity.
He to whom God is all:
All the World is nothing.
VII. CANT.
JESUS thinks on me, and I think of him.
JESUS works for me, and I work for him.
My heart suffices him,
And he suffices my heart.
He is contented with me, and I with him.
This is the Canticle of love,
Which I sing to him day and night.
The only good which I would have,
Is to will nothing.
To live without care, and without desire,
Is that which makes up all my pleasure.
VIII. CANT.
WHat do I feel in the bottom of my Soul?
What passes in the bottom of my heart?
The Wedding is made in Cana.
JESUS there works a Miracle.
He changed the Water into Wine.
He entered in at midnight,
The doors of the senses being shut.
I saw him without seeing him.
I knew him without knowing him.
My eye did not see him pass.
My ear did not hear him walk.
I smelt the odor of his perfumes.
I tasted the honey of his sweets.
O my God!
Into what Country do you bring me.
Am I in Heaven, or on Earth?
Am I in time, or in Eternity?
I see you, without Image.
I touch you, without a Body.
I feel you, without an Organ.
I am doubtless in Heaven.
O, if this lasts long, I must die.
IX. CANT.
REtire from me my beloved,
But retire not for any long time.
Withdraw your presence,
But withdraw not your love.
Withdraw your sweetnesses,
But leave me your sorrows.
Draw your heaven out of my soul.
Or else draw my soul into your heaven.
I can have no joy, if I am not on a Cross.
Unless you make me suffer,
You will make me die.
Your sweets are too many.
Your sorrows are to few.
O my God my love!
All my pleasure is to suffer.
All my desire is to die.
My Soul!
Sing for ever this sweet Canticle of joy.
I will content God.
I will be contented with God.
He will be contented with me,
When I am contented with him.
I shall testify to him my contentment,
When I am calm in my pains.
I am not contented with him,
If I murmur against him.
X. CANT.
I Place all my glory,
In being despised for you.
I place all my riches,
In possessing nothing but you.
I place all my pleasure;
In suffering much for you.
I live. I live no longer.
I am: and I am no more my self.
You and I are no longer but one.
All my wills are destroyed.
All my hopes are ruined.
All my desires are extinct.
All my Being is annihilated.
I labor no longer but for you.
I breath no more but by you.
I subsist no more but in you.
You in me. I in you.
You for me. I for you.
To be where you would have me.
To will what you will.
To do what you would have me.
To suffer what you would have me.
Is what makes a man perfect and happy.
