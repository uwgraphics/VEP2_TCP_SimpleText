Lord WILLOUGHBY:
Being a true Relation of a famous and bloody BATTLE fought in Flanders, by the
Noble and Valiant Lord Willoughby, with 1500 English, against 40000 Spaniards,
where the English obtained a notable Victory, to the Glory and Renown of our
Nation.

To the Tune of, Lord Willoughby, etc.


THe fifteenth Day of July,
with glistering Spear and Shield,
A famous Fight in Flanders,
was foughten in the field:
The most courageous Officers,
was English Captains three;
But the bravest Man in Battle
was brave Lord Willoughby.
The next was Captain Norris,
a valiant Man was he;
The other Captain Turner,
that from field would never flee:
With fifteen hundred fighting Men,
alas, there was no more,
They fought with forty thousand then
upon the bloody shore.
Stand to it noble Pike-man,
and look you ^ound about.
And sho^t you right you Bowmen,
and we will keep them out.
You Musket and Cavalier Men,
do you prove true to me,
I Will be the foremost Man in fight,
says brave Lord Willoughby.
And then the bloddy Enemy
they fiercely did assail,
And fought it out most valiantly,
not doubting to prevail:
The wounded man on both sides fell,
most piteously to see,
Yet nothing could the courage quell.
of brave Lord Willoughby.
For seven hours to all Men's view,
this Fight endured sore,
Un^il our Men so feeble grew
that they could fight no more:
And then upon dead Horses
full favourly they eat;
And drink the Puddle-water,
(...) no better to (...) they get.


When they had fed so freely,
they kneeled on the ground,
And praised God devoutly
for the favor they had found:
And bearing up their Colors,
the fight they did renew,
And turning toward the Spaniards,
five thousand more they slew.
The sharp steel pointed Arrows,
and Bullets thick did fly.
Then did our valiant Soldiers
charge on most furiously:
Which made the Spaniards waver,
they thought it best to flee;
They feared the stout behavior
of brave Lord Willoughby.
Then quoth the Spanish General,
Come let us march away,
I fear we shall be spoiled all,
if that we longer stay:
For yonder comes Lord Willoughby
with courage fierce and fell,
He will not give one inch of way
for all the Devils in Hell.
And then the fearful Enemy
was quickly put to flight,
Our Men pu^su'd courageously,
and rout their Forces quite:
But at the last they gave a shout,
which ecchoed through the Sky,
God and St. George for England,
the Conquerors did cry.
This news was brought to England
with all the speed might be;
And told unto our gracious Queen
of this same Uictory:
O this is brave, Lord Willoughby
my love has ever won,
Of all the Lords of Honor
it is he great deeds has done.
For Soldiers that were maimed
and wounded in the fray,
The Queen allowed a Pension
of eighteen-pence a day;
Besides all cost and charges
she quit and set them free;
And this she did all for the sake
of brave Lord Willoughby.
Then courage noble English Men,
and never be dismayed,
If that we be but one to ten,
we will not be afraid,
To fight with foreign Enemies,
and set our Nation free;
And thus I end the bloody bout
of (...) Lord Willoughby.
