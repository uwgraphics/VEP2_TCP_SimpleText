A brief Relation of an Atheistical creature, living at Lambert, which is of a
strange opinion that his sins are too big for him to go to Heaven, and too
little for him to go to hell, he thinks he shall dye a Pharisie: Further he
desired to have a Commission to burn every new married couple in the Buttock,
but paying him forty shillings they should escape unburned.

To the tune of, Jesper Cuuningam^, or brave Lord Willoby.


GOod Christians all give ear awhile,
and mark what I relate,
There lives a man in Lambert Town,
governed by lucklesse fate:
An Arhist he in Judgment is,
not fearing Heaven nor Hell,
But in presumption every day,
against God he does rebel.
He thus unto his Neighbors spoke,
my sins quoth he are great,
That I my self shall not attain,
to fit in the Heavenly seat:
Nor shall my souls go down to Hell,
(sin does not multiply)
In heart I do believe that I
a Pharisie shall dye.
This as a jeere he thus did say,
blaspheming of our God,
But such that will not him obey,
shall surely feel his Rod:
Like the Fool he says there is no God,
but Men like Dogs must dye,
And have no other just reward,
of bliss or Misery,
But yet this Viper he is given
to covet after Bold,
Though neither he fears Hell nor Heaven
as this for truth is told:
A Commission he did seek to have,
a Villainous act to do,
Then lift a while you standers by,
and I Will declar't to you;
Quoth he, if I a grant might have,
and a commanding power,
Each married Couple I would brand,
to make their pleasure lower:
But if full forty shillings they,
to me would freely give,
They should enjoy their Loves in peace,
in Unity to live.
But those which did this same deny,
should feel my cruel ire
With irons hot I would them burn,
hot with the flaming fire:
With which, impression deep I Would make,
and were'em by my side,
The first that I in hand did take,
should be a young-mans Bride.
Inhumane like shus would he deal
with those new married,
His tyrant hand they sure should feel,
so soon as they were wed,
O what a Tiger would he prove,
if he in Office were,
The like before in all my life,
I never yet did here.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.


HIs savage mind does thirst for blood,
he is of the swinish breed,
And on the churlish Caniball,
on men's flesh he would feed:
And likewise the poor Female sex
he would punish with A brand,
This all young folks he would peplex,
unless they would bribe his hand.
This great confusion in the Land,
about Religion sure,
Do bring Men's hearts to heinous sins,
for all they are counted pure:
They climb so ho high above their reach,
it is the Brothers fricks,
Then from the top they down do fall
headlong and break their Necks.
So by that means there epicures,
and Atheists they do rise,
And Pharisees with their wild Sects,
Gods glory to despise,
The Antinomians lead the way,
for to commit all evil,
Saying to sin it is for their good,
though it lead them to the Devil,
When they in these wild ways are fixed,
like Judas some despair,
And presently go hang themselves,
in conscience troubled are:
^^me dround themselves, some stob themselves,
and some their throats do cut,
When Men run headlong in their ways,
those God from him does shut.
Good Christians be not thus sedus'd,
by Wolves clothed in Sheepskins,
For with your eyes you plainly see,
God plagues us for our sins.
If there be neither Heaven nor Hell,
how comes it then to pass,
In Winter time the Snow appears,
in Summertime the Grass:
The Sun the Moon, the Stars give light,
as God has so decreed,
But he that says there is no God,
is sure a fool indeed,
Let none delude you from the truth,
but faithfully believe,
That God is just in all his ways,
so may thou Heaven receive,
These vild Sectarians do annoy,
and fill the land with sin,
They Are sevenfold nearer the sons of Hell,
then when they did begin:
Believe not them, believe Gods Word,
so shall thou live in peace,
And let true-hearted Christians pray,
that Englands wars may sease.
Lord bless thy Ministers which teach
thy word in every Church,
And break in too the Sectaryes,
that would thy people lurch:
Heaven prosper us that we may live,
so as with you to dwell,
For goodly men shall go to Heaven,
and wicked ones to hell.
FINIS.
