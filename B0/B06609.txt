His Majesty's Letter to the Parliament.
WILLIAM R.

RIght Trusty, and right entirely Beloved Cousin and Counselor, We greet you
well; It is Our Will and Pleasure, that as soon as this comes to your Hands,
you signify to Our Parliament, Our gracious Acceptance of their Address,
bearing Date the 16 of May: And as We are fully satisfied with their
Expressions, both of their Sense of Our never enough to be Lamented Loss of Our
dearest Consort, and of their Duty and Affection to Our Royal Person and
Government, and which We doubt not they will testify, by a cheerful
Performance of what We recommend to them in Our Letter; So you may again assure
them in Our Name, that We shall be always ready to give Our Royal Concurrence
to any thing shall be proposed for the Security of the Government, and Interest
of the Nation. And so We bid you heartily farewell.

Given at Our Camp at Becklar the 10 and 20th day of June 1695, and of Our
Reign the 7th. Year. By His Majesty's Command, TO. PRINGLE.

Edinburgh, Printed by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer to
