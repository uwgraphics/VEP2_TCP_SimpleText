The unsatisfied LOVERS Lamentation.
This hapless lass in discontent
Laments and makes her moan,
and is with sorrow almost spent,
Because she lies alone.
Tune of, Hey boys up go we.




THis twenty years and more that I
have lived a single life,
Wanting a youngmans company,
and cannot be made a Wife.
Oh! could I find some brisk young Lad
one bout with me to try,
Twould ease my heart that now is sad,
and hey boys down I Will lie.
Unfortunate indeed am I,
unmarried to remain,
Ten thousand sighs at least have I
spent, sent, b^t all in vain,
And whosoever asks me,
it is sure I Will never deny,
Who am in necessity,
and hey boys down I Will lie.
Had I ten thousand pounds in Gold,
I Would give it for a touch,
Or Jewels, more than e're were sold,
I Would think them not too much.
But freely I would give them all
to ease my Mallady,
Come Jack or Will and take your fill,
for hey boys down I Will lie.
And sport as long as you think good,
then lie you down and rest,
If this by me were understood,
I then should sure be blessed.
Then come away for pity sake,
one bout with me to try,
With my soft hand i will make it stand,
then hey boys down i will lie.




With kisses and embraces sweet
your Courage I Will refresh,
To make my happiness complete,
by tasting of the flesh.
Come, come with speed and do the deed
or else for love I dye,
I sigh and mourn and sadly groan,
that hey boys down would lie.
Was ever any loving Girls,
like me left in distress,
The thing which some do count a Pearl
there is nothing I love less.
My Maidenhead I do not esteem,
would it were gone say I,
I shall be vexed and much perplexed,
till hey boys down I lie.
There Is not a Lass I do believe
in Country or in City,
That wanting man did so much grieve,
and yet did find less pity,
My very sheets each night I know,
and like one mad am I,
Yet shall not rest but he oppressed,
till hey boys down I lie.
Twere better I had been unborn,
then such a life to live,
That young men all both great and small
deny relief to give.
By Nature I am not so foul
or shapeless to the Eye,
Then give some ease to this disease,
and hey boys down i will lie.
Such wanton thoughts possess my mind
by night and eke by day,
That sometimes I am half inclined
to make my self away.
Then I these thoughts do check again,
in time I hope say I,
May find a friend that may extend
his love, then down lie I.
As yet I hapless do remain,
and quite bereaved of hope,
Were I in either France or Spain,
i would ask leave of the Pope.
That I might Trade with some young blade
he could not me deny,
Then should I be from Torment free,
and hey boys down i would lie.
