The Noble Prodigal, OR, The young Heir newly come to his Estate.
Who very kindly does invite you all,
To feast upon his Fathers funeral.
A new Medly of six Airs.


First Air. The Jews Corant.
Let Us call and drink the Cellar dry,
There Is nothing sober underneath the sky
The greatest Kingdoms in confusion lie,
Since all the world grow mad, why may not I?
my Fathers dead, and I am free
he left no children in the world but me.
the Devil drank him down with usury
and I Will repine in liberality.
When first the English war began
He was p^ecisely a politic man,
That gained his state by Sequestration
till Oliver began
to come with sword in hand and put him to the run
Then jovial Lads who are undone
So by the Father come home to the Son,
Whom wine and music now do wait upon
he will tipple up a tun,
and drink your woes away, jolly hearts come on come on
Second Air. Princess Royal.
Here Is a health to him that may
do a trick that shall
advance you all
And beget a very jovial day.
Fill another bowl to he
Who has drank by stealth
his Landlords health
If his spirit and his tongue agree
the Land shall celebrate his fame,
all the world enbalm his name,
not a right good fellow,
but will satisfy the same.
The bells full merrily shall ring
All the town shall dance and sing
more delights then I can tell ye
When we see this noble Spring,
we will have Ladies by the belly
and snatch at at o'ther thing.

Fourth Air. French Tricatees.

De French can live vithout de nose,
Fifth Air. French Tricatees.
Spain and England then,

Shall love and make a League again,
Holland Boors shall quaff,
and laugh,
Poor Irish swim in Usquebaugh,

Drink till all the Sky look blew,
by this sweet change
Wonders shall ensue.
almost as strange
As Scotland to be true.
Sixth Air. A new Country-dance.
No Drayman shall wish his dull feet appear
Lord in the Commonweal,
Or Jesuits in the Pulpit appear;
under a Cloak of zeal
Mucleian never be noted
for wandering men of ease,
But they shall be finely Coated
and permitted to sing what they please
If all things do but hit well as
who knows but so t'may be,
Though now you be very zealous
then you will laugh and be marry as we
