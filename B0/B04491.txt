The Night-VValkers; Or, The Loyal HUZZA.
Since Treason never wanted a Pretense,
Sure Virtues chiefest Guard is Innocence;
But I Will not trust her with it at this time,
For fear I make my Innocence a Crime:
Imposing Man may Virtue backward draw,
Therefore I Will Guard her with a loud Huzza.
To the Tune of, On the Bank of a River, etc.
THe Town is our own,
when the Streets are all clear;
We manage the humor,
and laugh at all fear;
Then down goes the Bully,
the Heck, and Night-Walker;
The whispering Cully,
and every loud Talker:
The Constable flies,
and his Club-men withdraw;
When they hear the fierce cries
of the dreadful Huzza:
The Constable; etc.
[2]
We neither do spare then,
Gown, Surplice, nor Sword,
But draw up our Forces,
and give them the Word:
Down down goes the Lawyer,
the Priest, and the Captain;
And woe to the House
that a Candle is kept in:
We Will make the Glass fly,
and the Pimps stand in awe,
When they hear the fierce cry
of the Dreadful Huzza:
We Will make the Glass, etc.
[3]
Mistake us not neither,
for all our loud Huffing;
We Will scorn and abhor to
the Name of a Russian:
Our Prince we do Honor,
and all that are Loyal;
The Duke and his Interest,
but Whigg we defy all:
And those who'd change Kings,
without Reason or Law,
We Will make them to swing,
or observe our Huzza:
And those, etc.
[4]
If a Yea of a Nay,
or a brave of the Court,
Or a Canting soft Sister,
that is fit for the sport,
Down Tabitha goes then,
the Saint and the Wicked,
Though they are Lungs are consumed,
till they sing like a Cricket:
We Will make 'um strain high,
to declare for our Law,
And advance the fierce cry,
of the Dreadful Huzza:
We Will make, etc.
[5]
Huzza is the Word,
wheresoever we go,
We own not a Friend,
nor we fear not a Foe:
The Wine in our heads,
and the Sword in our hands,
Are able to baffle
The City Train'd-bands:
We scorn to subscribe
to your Reason or Law,
Since we have a Tribe
to maintain the Huzza:
We scorn, etc.
[6]
If we chance for to meet
with a party Bravading,
In Modish Harangues,
or in brisk Sarranading;
Our Link-Boys do summons
to silence their Piping,
Which straight they obey,
for fear of our Fighting:
The Squires and their Pipers,
submit and withdraw,
Whilst we give the Ladies
a swinging Huzza:
The Squires, etc.
[7]
Some Play, Swear, and Whore,
some do Plot, Pimp, and Pad,
Some Write till they are laughed at,
some Read till they are Mad:
Some Rail and Lampoon,
till their Wits are quite weary,
But on the Huzza,
we can never Miscarry:
We make the Rogues fly,
or embrace our New Law,
And advance the fierce Cry
of the dreadful Huzza:
We Will make, etc.
FINIS.
