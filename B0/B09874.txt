A Representation to King and Parliament, of some of the Unparralleld
Sufferings of the People of the Lord, called Quakers, in New England. Together
with the Remarkable Judgments of God upon sundry of their Persecutors.
IN these few Lines; O KING; Thou and thy Parliament, may see the continued
Sufferings of thy faithful and loving Subjects, under the cruel and bloody
hands of the Priests and Rulers, in New England, who in the days of O. C. (the
time of thy Suffering) as if countenanced and Commissionated by him, did, for
diverse years, most barbarously spoil and ruin the Goods of thy Innocent
Subjects there, halling them out of their Habitations to Prison, far from their
Families and little Ones, cruelly torturing their Bodies with Whipps, and
pitched Ropes, and locking up neck and heels in Irons many hours, with
famishings near unto death, being without pity to the aged Parents, or to
their helpless Children; Chaining to a Log of Timber Night and Day, a long and
very cold Winter; dragging Men along by the hair of their Heads, and the tender
Women (as they were on their knees in Prayer) dragged out of the House by the
hands, with their faces toward the Earth, over Stumps, and old Trees, through
very deep frost and snow, to Prison near a Mile; and causing the Innocent to be
hanged up naked by the hands, with a logg hanged to the feet, and the body
cruelly beaten by the hands of a strong Negro with Cords; one burned in the
Hand, and in his Mouth bound a great Key; others their Ears part cut off;
together with Banishing Fathers, Mothers and Children, and offering to send
their little Ones thousands of miles from their Native Country and Fathers
House, to be sold for Servants or Bondslaves; and last of all, in the height
of the spirit of the wicked one, the spirit of madness, blindness, blood and
murder, they spared not, but cruelly put to death the Servants of the Living
God. And now, O King, since the very day the Lord brought thee into this Land
again, and gave unto thee thy Regal Power, have they in thy Name, made strange
and cruel havoc of thy true Subjects, in putting to Death and Banishing; and
in thy Name with many torturing Whippings of Old and Young, at Posts, and at
wheels of great Guns, and at Carts Tails, dragging the naked Bodies of Parents
and Children through diverse long Towns, through the dirt and filth of their
Channels and Cart-ways; and in thy Name commanding one Friend and Brother to
help Imprison the other; yea, in thy Name they have lately pressed the Son to
help to force his tender Father and Mother to Goal, sundry miles, in the
extremity of Winter season, to the hazard of their Lives; and such as refused
to obey their Unnatural and Abominable Commands, they have fined at their
Courts; and thus from Court to Court do these Monsters of Men, in thy Name,
Fine and break open the Houses of the Quakers, and Rob them of their Goods, and
take away that they should eat in, and that they should drink in, yea the very
Clothes from their Backs in Winter, and the Bed they should lie on, while they
keep the Body sundry miles off in Prison, driving Husbands and Wives diverse
miles for Prison, in times of great Frost and Snow, keeping them close
Prisoners in a very cold Room, to the endangering of their Lives, and to the
ruin of their Families, had not the Lord preserved. All this, and much more,
too tedious to mention at this time, have they done to the servants of the Lord
in New England in thy Name; saying, that Thou ownest their doings, and
esteemest their Laws as thy Laws; And these hard things have the Servants of
the Lord patiently suffered, and sustained at their hands, for no other cause
but for their faithful obedience to the Spirit of the Lord in their hearts,
which Spirit of Holiness teaches them, That Forced Worships and Worshippers
are both Abomination to the Lord. These few Lines are written not from any
desire of the least Revenge from thy hand upon them, but that thou may know
it, and make known thy dislike of their wickedness, that so the blood of the
Innocent there, if possible, might not be laid to your charge in the terrible
Day of the Lord, in which both High and Low must come to Judgment, and receive
according to their Deeds done in the Body, in which day the Lord will make
known (in the sight of all his Enemies) his mighty Power for the saving of his
beloved Ones, and for the delivering and helping of them, who had no helper in
the Earth.

A Brief Relation of the Eminent Hand and Judgments of the Lord upon some of
the Rulers, Priests and People of New England, who were of them that Persecuted
the People of the Lord, called Quakers, there.
OLD John Endicot Governor, that Nero-like unjust Judge of the Innocent, who
in his mad Nebuchadnezzar-like spirit, threatened and endeavored to weary out
and to destroy the Servants of the Most High, and to root out their very Name
from amongst them. He with his Hangman, that Murderer, who together had imbrued
their hands in the blood of the Innocent Lambs of the Living God, were both by
the hands of the Lord hewed down and at one time laid on their deathbeds, so
that some did say, Who would have thought the Head and Tail should go so near
together? So the Lord cut down Endicot, Root and Branch, and his Hangman its
said died in great horror of Mind, and torment of Body. And this is according
to the Word of the Lord fore-spoken by the mouth of his Servants concerning
them.

Another Eminent Persecutor, (who had a hand in Judging and Murdering of the
Innocent) Humphery Atherton, their Major General, who sitting to Judge the
Just, he and his Brethren having sent out Mary Dyer to be murdered, and tidings
being brought to the Bench that she was turned off the Gallows, he said to the
servants of the Lord, Prisoners at the Bar, That Mistress Dyer did hang for a
Flag for them to take warning by; and that the Quakers did often tell them,
That the Judgments of the Lord would come upon them, but the Judgments of the
Lord are not come upon us yet. But the Just Hand of the Lord met with him in
his Jollity and Pomp, as he was riding home from his Play-fellows in Boston,
and near the Place where they used to finish their Journey in Whipping and
dragging the Quakers at a Carts-tail out of Boston, his Horse gave him such a
deadly throw, that it is said, He never spoke word after his fall; but his Eyes
swelled, as started out of his Head, and as it were Blood and Brains came out
of his Nostrils and Ears, and his Tongue in a ghastly manner hanging out of his
mouth; A Flagg indeed was he for Blood-guilty Men to be warned by; according to
the word of the Lord, foretold by the mouth of his Servants.

John Danford, a Member of their Church, and Captain of their Castle by Boston,
being laid (in the heat of the day) upon his Bed, the Hand of the Lord in a
strange manner, with a crack of Thunder, and flash of Lightning, in a moment
smote him to death; so it is testified, he never spoke more.

On that day the Rulers and Priests of Boston had agreed to mingle their
Sacrifice with the Blood and Lives of the Innocent, the Persecutors returning,
and rejoicing in the murdering and hanging of William Robinson and Marmaduke
Stevenson, as sundry of them were passing over a great Drawbridge, it
suddenly brake down in pieces with them, and diverse of them were wounded and
bruised with the weighty fall thereof; and one or two of them, who seemed to
joy in the Death of the Innocent; its said, That the Bones of their Arms, with
Thighs and other parts of their Bodies, were broken to pieces, and after a few
days torment of Body, and rotting alive, died: And in this also was the Word of
the Lord fulfilled, spoken to the Bench by the mouth of that faithful Martyr,
who said, Take heed ye Rulers what ye do, and be warned before it be too late,
and know, that in that day you put us to Death, shall the Judgments of God
come upon this place.

Old Thomas Wiggin Magistrate, a bloody Persecutor, who was deeply engaged in
the Sufferings, and in the taking away of the Lives of the Martyrs of Jesus,
who often without bowels of pity, would shed the Blood and devour the Goods of
the Innocent; him also has the Hand of the Lord cut down, and his Children may
come to want: And this also is according to the Word of the Lord, by the
mouths of his Servants to him.

James Oliver, that Beastly, and bloody spirited Creature, who as one
implacable, unmerciful, without bowels of common natural affection, who was so
swift to shed Innocent blood, that he struck down the Servant of the Lord,
William Robison, as he was taking him out of Prison to hang him. Whose inhumane
cruelty, bloodshed, and murderous spirit, the Righteous God has in
Remembrance, who was fierce to take away the Lives of the Righteous; the
blasting hand of the Lord is risen up, against and over him; according to the
Word of the Lord spoken by his faithful Servants, whom he helped to hang on a
Tree.

John Webb, that proud Persecutor, whom the Lord has laid wast, who with a
Body of Men in Arms, led forth Mary Dier to be murdered and hanged: It Is said,
as he was busy in killing a Whale, or great Fish, was suddenly after a strange
manner carried into the Sea and drowned; and here was a remarkable Hand also
upon this Persecutor, according to the Word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of
his Servants.

Captain Johnson, who led forth the Servant of the Lord, William Ledra, to be
murdered and hanged, compassing him about with Men of War, with Swords, Guns,
and Drums; the Just Hand of the Lord, for his bloody act, has fallen upon him
also, for he is as a man unmanned and bereaft of his wonted understanding, and
so sottish, that his Brethren, as its said, have degraded him; and this is
according to the Word of the Lord, spoken by his Servants concerning him.

Marshal Brown of Ipswich, who Persecuted the Servants of the Lord, and
unrighteously took away their Goods; soon after the Lord cast him upon the bed
of languishing, where for a time, it is testified, he lay in great horror of
Conscience, and torment of Body, and so departed this Life; and this is
according to the Word of the Lord by the mouth of his faithful Witnesses.

Samuel Archer, Marshal in Salem, who was of their Church Fellowship, he had
often Robbed and spoiled the Goods of the People called Quakers, to pay his
Masters Reckonings at the Taverns; he was suddenly cut off, and is come to
naught, and his remembrance rotts; according to the Word of the Lord against
such as do resist the Holy One wilfully.

James Underwood, a wicked Persecuting Constable who made it his work to
disturb the People of God in their holy waitings on the Lord, who would Press
one Friend to help him to lead another as Prisoner; after this his wickedness
against the Lord, and his People, though he had a considerable Estate, yet the
hand of the Lord being against him, he came to naught; this also is according
to the Word of the Lord which his Servants testified concerning Persecutors.

An Eminent hand of Gods displeasure upon some of the Priests also: John
Norton, Chief Priest in Boston, and chief in stirring up the Rulers to Murder,
Hang and Persecute, and to take away the Lives of the Innocent, He by the
immediate power of the Lord was smitten, and as he was sinking down, by the
fireside, being under Just Judgment, he confessed the hand of the Lord was
upon him, and so died; and the Word of the Lord, by the mouth of his Servant,
whom he stirred up the Rulers to put to death, was fulfilled upon him.

Old Edward Norris, Priest in Salem, he stirring up the Rulers and People there
to madness, saying, What was done to the Quakers, was not Persecution but
Prosecution; as he was vindicating his bloody Principle, was suddenly and
strangely smitten dumb in his Pulpit, and after a while died.

Old Priest Wilson, who reviled the Servants of the Lord as they were led forth
to be put to death, was also by the Hand of the Lord swept away.

Timothy Dolton, Priest of Hampton, he hearing it certified, that The Light
within, was the Light of Christ; Cried out, Oh horrible blasphemy! He soon
after dies.

Priest Mitchel of Cambridge, who lately stirred up the Rulers to Persecution
and Madness, soon after was smitten down by the hand of the Lord; and it is
testified, That his very Tongue, while he was alive, turned exceeding black in
his mouth, and soon after he died.

Sundry others, not here mentioned, has the hand of the Lord visited with
Judgments upon themselves, and upon the fruit of their Bodies, taking away the
Lives of diverse of their Firstborn by unusual deaths; and from year to year to
this day, since they murdered the Servants of the Lord, has the hand of
Justice blasted their Corn in their Fields; for when their fields of Wheat are
in the Ear, and near to Blossom, then is it in a strange manner smitten with
Death at the Root; and when the Husbandman sees the Curse or Blast upon it,
hastes to mow it down, while it is green, for Fodder; but its loathsome to the
Beasts of the field, so that they care not to eat it. This is remarkable, and a
lively Figure of New-Englands Abominable Profession, and a true token of Gods
displeasure against them; according to the Word of the Lord spoken to them by
the mouth of his Servants whom they put to death.

And now has the Lord, in Bloody Boston, poured out a sore Plague, even a rent
between Rulers, Priests and People; so that in the bitterness of their envious
hearts, they are risen up one against another, to the endangering of dashing
their Babel to pieces: And this they know was foretold, and certified to and
amongst them, by Word and Signs, by the Lords Servants, who testified in the
Name and Spirit of Truth, That as a Potters Vessel, so should they be broken
never to be joined together any more. These things are written not in Malice or
Prejudice to any of the forementioned Persecutors, but in tender love to all
Rulers, Priests and People, that they in the fear of the Lord may be warned by
them, to take heed how they open their mouths, or lift up their hands against
the Innocent, for God is on their side; and although some, to their own
destruction, have been suffered to persecute and put some of the Bodies of the
Children of the Living God to death, yet against the Life and Power of the Lord
in them, they nor their weapons shall never prosper, the mouth of the Lord has
spoken it. And as for them that remain of the dark Persecuting Priests, Rulers
and People in New England, whose hands have been dyed in the Blood and lives of
the Innocent, Oh that there were in them an heart truly sensible of their great
wickedness against the Lord, and against his People, that so they might be
truly humbled before the Lord, and so come to be delivered from the wrath to
come, which will most assuredly overcome and destroy all them that fight
against the Lord.

Oh New England, New England, how can the tenderhearted, (whom thou have most
cruelly Persecuted and despitefully used) in the sense of thy sad state,
forbear to take up a Lamentation for thee; who seemed beautiful in thy
beginning, and lovely wast thou whilst in thy integrity, which was but for a
moment, or as the early dew, for thy day was eclipsed in the morning, and thou
soon went a whoring from the Guide of thy youth, and so thou becamest as a
monstrous woman in his sight, and now thou art unto him as Sodom, and thy
offspring as Gomorrah, who perished in the morning; for thy Wickedness is as
Scarlet, and thy Iniquities as Crimson before the Lord. Let the ears of
Kindred, Nations and People, that hear of thy horrible Apostasy, tingle; for
thou soon grew'st great, and said in thy heart, I am as Queen of all
Nations; and in the greatness of thy Pride, as thou attempted'st to climb up
high, even into the Throne of God, How art thou fallen, oh thou untimely
daughter of Babylon! Let all People and Professors who hear of thy deadly fall,
fear, and tremble, and dread the Living God, and with speed come out of their
empty Forms, the Chambers of Death, and come into the mighty Power of the
Endless Life of God, that in it you may escape the wrath of the Almighty, which
is coming upon the World, which lies in wickedness. Woe unto you ye Rulers and
Hierling Priests of New England, for the Lord has found you in the way of
Cain, who have drunk the blood of Martyrs and Saints, and mingled it with your
Sacrifices, and in the filthy error of Balaam, Persecuting and Killing the
Just. Woe unto you Rulers and Priests of New England, who have taken counsel to
destroy the Work of the Lord, and have labored to suppress the Sun in its
rising: Ye are as Pharaoh and his Magicians; for you have withstood him who is
come in his mighty Power, to lead Israel out of Aegypts darkness and house of
Bondage. Woe unto you Priests and Rulers of New England, who have cut off the
Life of the Prophets from amongst their Brethren, and have cruelly entreated
the Children of the Lord, whom he has sent, and raised up amongst you: You
have slain the Lords Worthies upon your High Places; therefore upon your
Mountain comes no Dew nor Rain, and your House is left desolate, because the
Lord is departed from it, for in it is found the Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus;
and there it is you have killed the tender Lambs in the Bosom, and the Royal
and lovely Babes as they were Sucking the Breasts of their Mother. For these
things sake will I arise and plead with you, O ye the greatest of mine Enemies,
says the Almighty, who in the height of your Pride boasted, and said, There
was not such another Church in the World, as the Church at Boston: But your
bloody hands have made you manifest to be the worst, among them called Churches
in the whole World.
