The STATES-MAN'S Last Will and Testament; OR, His worthy Legacies left to his
beloved Cronies, for whom he had a particular kindness.
Tune of, O rare Popery.



ALas! I am taken most monstrous ill.
Sweet Writer bring hither your Paper and Duill,
For here I am ready to male my last Will,
And leave my Legacies, delicate Legacies,
Chanchellors Legacies, O.
My wonderful portions I here will divide,
According as Merit my reason shall guide,
Let Lucifer have my invintible Pride,
Sing O brave Legacy, etc.
My Covetous heart now as hitter as Ball,
I leave to old Misers in hopes that they shall,
Like me get in Gold here the Devil and all,
Sing O rare Legacies, etc.
My small Guts let honest Musitioners take,
That they of the same may Fiddle strings make,
And then scrape my Guts till their very heartsake,
Sing O brave Legacy, Chancellors Legacy,
A delicate Legacy, O.
And as for my Pole I will leave (...),
To my dearest Friend that makes pitiful moan,
Because he has never a Nose of his own,
Sing O rare Legacy, etc.
My unruly Tongue which run at that rate,
And banteed men out of their reason of late,
I leave it to Fifth Women at Billingsgate,
Sing O rare Legacy, etc.
My Brains I bequeath but I know not to who,
But hold, I remember the Jesuit Crew,
They Will serve them for pletting more mischief to do;
Sing O rare Legacy, etc.
My old empty Skull to the Pope now shall go,
In token of Favors which he did bestow,
'T will make him a lusty large Punch Bowl I know,
Sin O rare Legacy, etc.
My honored Keverend Father the Pope,
He sent his sweet Son here a sandiked Rope;
But I have no need of the same now I hope,
I Will leave that Legacy, delicate Legacy,
no one of the Jesuit Crew.
My lusty large Conscience which Brives did receive,
To some Corrupt Lawyer I freely do leave,
That honest Men he may of Living hereane,
A worthy Legacy, etc.
My Body I into the West do return,
It will make the Wives there a good butter Churnn,
Thus for my bad deeds I may do one good turn
Sing O rare Legacy, etc.
Now sign it and seal it according to Law,
The Major shall never keep the Minor in awe,
Nor wrong them so much as the weight of a straw,
Of these my Legacies, Chanchellors Legacies,
delicate Legacies, O.
FINIS.
Printed in the Year, 1689.
