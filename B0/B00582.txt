The merry conceited Less,
Whose hearts desire was set on fire,
A husband for to have:
In hope that he would certainly,
Maintain her fine and brave.
To a pleasant new Northern tune.




I Am a young woman and feign I would have,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
A husband that will maintain mebraue,
It Is that which my heart does wish and crave,
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
And if I have a husband kind,
te rala tal da rat de ra do,
That gives content unto my mind,
A courteous wife he shall me find.
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
But if my husband froward be,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
The same bread he does break to me,
He shall eat part out presently.
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
And if my husband use to rome,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
He shall not keep me like a mome,
He were better to stay with me at home.
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
And if my husband keeps me bare,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
With thread bare clothes and hungry fare,
The worst will fall to his own share.
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
And if my husband use me well,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
Of his deserts my tongue shall tell,
How that in love he does excel,
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
If he buy me new hat and gown,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
That I may flaunt it up and down,
With some of the brauest in the town.
te ra la la te ra la la tal da rat de ra do.
The second part
To the same tune.




ANd if he does abuse my name,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
I will not greatly his words blame,
For I am as like to do the same.
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal da rat de ra do.
But if he ply the good ale pot,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
And have no money to pay the shot,
But come home like a drunken sott,
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal de rat de ra do.
And if he chance to bang my coat,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
So that he do not hurt my throat,
Then will I sing a pleasant note,
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal da rat de ra do.
But if he come home fort to bed,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
I will not strive to wrong his head,
Though by the fore-top he is led,
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal da rat de ra do,
And if my husband catch a fall,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
I hope he will keep him from the wall,
If he have a staff to hold withal.
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal da rat de ra do.
And if my husband will be drunk,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
And loves the company of a punke,
Until he be in liquor sunk.
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal da rat de ra do.
If any young man be weary of his life,
te ra la tal da rat de ra do,
Let him make choice of me for his wife,
And there is an end of all the strife.
te ra la la, te ra la la, tal da rat de ra do,
L.P.

FINIS.
