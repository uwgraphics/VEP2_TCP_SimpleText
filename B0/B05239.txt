EDINBURGH, the 13 of December. 1644.
THe Committee of Estates, Taking to their consideration the present condition
and estate of this Kingdom, and how that many of his Majesty's good Subjects
have been pursued by some unnatural Contrymen and Irish Rebels; Their
Houses burnt, Their Lands wasted, and, Their Corns and Goods destroyed; so as
they have nothing left to live on to maintain their Wives, Children, and
Families. And finding it just and necessar That such as have suffered, or shall
suffer, for their love to Religion, and safety of the Kingdom, should be taken
notice of by the Public; The Committee does therefore declare, That every
Gentleman that has or shall be spoiled by the Rebels, and will be content to
take Service, and shall have employment according to their several conditions
and abilities: And for such as are poor and mean men, they shall be taken on in
Service and maintained in the Army: And for women and children, course shall
be taken how they may be supplied. And how soon it shall please God to put an
end to the troubles of this Kingdom, Then the Committee will take their
severell losses into consideration; and according to the deserving of the
parties and prejudices sustained by them, be careful that they be supplied and
repaired of their losses; as may best witness that this Kingdom acknowledge
themselves bound in duty, and by the Covenant, to be sensible of the
sufferings of their Brethren in the defense thereof. And ordains Publication to
be made hereof by open Proclamation at all places needful.

Arch. Primerose.
