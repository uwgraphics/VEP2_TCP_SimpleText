Love in a Mist;
A loving Couple once together met,
And changing words, a Passion did beget:
A Mist before my eyes I have, quoth she,
What do thou mean, my Boy, to do with me:
To the Tune of, Hey boys up go we.




A Thumping lusty Country Lad,
was tripping over the Plain,
And meeting with a hansome Maid,
some talk did entertain:
Quoth he, thou art exceeding fair,
thou do my heart surprise,
Quoth she, I prithee have a care,
There Is a mist before mine eyes.
Now is my heart thine own, quoth he,
so beautiful thou art,
That I must needs thy Captive be,
I feel such deadly smart:
Quoth she, if thou but Loyal prove,
i will not thy love despise,
For I am almost fallen in love,
With a mist before mine eyes.
Said he, my love it is entire,
I love thee as my life,
If thou will grant me my desire,
then thou shall be my wife:
Embracing her, he laid her down,
and just as down she lies,
I pray thee now my fancy Crown,
Though a mist's before mine eyes.




TO work they went immediately,
he touched her to the quick,
And so did please her Fantasy,
with this same pretty trick:
Quoth she, that Maid is surely mad,
that this same sport denies,
When she meets with a lusty Lad,
Though a mist's before her eyes.
Thus kissing and embracing too,
upon the Green they lay,
She cried, I have not yet my due,
come let us longer play:
This is the prittiest kind of Trade,
that Love did e're devise,
Sure it is Cupid that has made,
This mist before mine eyes.
A gentle fire within my breast,
methinks I now do feel,
The pleasure cannot be expressed,
no tongue can it reveal:
But if I were a Maid again,
I should my self despise,
It Is pretty sport I tell you plain,
Though a mist's before mine eyes.
My Mother she was much too blame,
to me so much persuade,
Never to mind this pleasant Game,
but still to live a Maid:
For when she tells me so again,
her Counsel i will despise,
I cannot see i will tell her plain,
There Is a mist before mine eyes.
Come let us try the the other touch,
for I have not enough,
She that does at this pastime grutch,
does sure mistake the stuff:
And as he entered then the Fort,
it is mighty sweet, she cries,
Oh who would think this pretty sport
Casts mists before mine eyes.
She put this Youngster to his Trumps
till he began to blow,
But up and down she briskly jumps,
for sometimes 'twill be so:
Quoth she, i will never after miss,
such opportunities,
For this is perfect Lovers bliss,
With a mist before mine eyes.
At last he forced was to retire,
which caused her to frown,
He hoped that he had cooled her fire;
and as he laid her down,
He thought it would good manners be,
again to see her rise:
And thou, quoth she, have cured me,
Of the mistbefomi rene eyes.
Printed for I. Deacon, at the Angel in Guiltspur-street.
