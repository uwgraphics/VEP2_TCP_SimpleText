A most excellent Song of the love of young Palmus, and fair Sheldra, with
their unfortunate love.
To the tune of Shackley-hay.


YOung Palmus was a Ferriman,
whom Sheldra fair did love:
At Shackley where her sheep did graze,
she there his thoughts did prove.
But he unkindly stole away,
and left his love at Shackley-hay.
Fa la la, fa, la la la la.
So loud at Shackley did she cry,
the woods resound at Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, fa, la la la la.
But all in vain she did complain,
for nothing could him move:
Till wind did turn him back again,
and brought him to his love.
When she saw him thus turned by fate,
She turned her love to mortal hate.
Fa, la la, etc.
Then weeping to her did he say,
I Will live with thee at Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
No, no, (quoth she) I thee deny,
my love thou once did scorn,
And my prayers would not hear,
but left me here forlorn:
And now being turned by fate of wind,
Thou think to win me to thy mind.
Fa, la la, etc.
Go, go, farewell I thee denay,
Thou shall not live at Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
If that thou do my love disdain,
because I live on seas,
Or that I am a Ferry-man,
my Shel^ra does displease:
I will no more in that estate,
Be servile unto wind and fate,
Fa, la la, etc.
But quite forsake Boats, Oars and Sea,
And live with thee at Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
My Sheldra's bed shall be my Boat,
her arms shall be my Oars,
where love in stead of storms shall float
on pleasant downs and shores:
Her sweetest breath my gentle gale,
Through tides of love to drive my sail
Fa, la la, etc.
Her look my praise and she my joy,
To live with me at Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
Not Phao shall with me compare,
so fortunate to prove:
Fair Venus never was his fare,
I Will bear the Queen of love:
The working waters never fear
For Cupids self our Barge shall steer
Fa, la la etc.
And to the shore I still will cry,
My Sheldra comes to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
To strew my Boat for thy avail,
I^e rob the flowrie shores,
And whilst thou guid'st the silken sail,
I Will row with silver Oars:
And as upon the streams we float,
A thousand Swans shall guide our boat.
Fa, la la, etc.
And to the shore still will I cry,
My Sheldra comes to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
And have a story painted there,
wherein there shall be seen,
Now Sapho ^ou'd a Ferriman,
being a learned Queen:
In golden letters shall be writ,
How well in love himself he quit,
Fa, la la, etc.
That all the Lasses still shall cry,
With Palmus we will to Shackley hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
And walking easily to the Strand,
we will angle in the brook,
And fish with thy white-lilly hand,
thou need'st no other book,
To which the fish shall soon be brought
and strive which shall the first be caught.
Fa, la la, etc.
A thousand pleasures will we try,
As we do row to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
And if we be oppressed with heat
in mid-time of the day,
Under the Willowes tall and great,
shall be our quiet bay,
Where I will make thee fans of bows,
From Phoebus beams to shade thy brows,
Fa, la la, etc.
And cause them at the Ferry cry,
A boat, a boat to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la etc.
A troop of dainty neighboring girls,
shall dance along the strand,
Upon the gravel all of pearls,
to wait when thou shall land,
And cast them selves about thee round,
Whilst thou with garlands shall be crowned,
Fa, la la, etc.
And all the shepherds with joy shall cry
O Sheldray is come to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
Although I did my self absent,
'twas but to try thy mind:
But now thou may thy self repent,
for being so unkind:
For now thou art turned by wind and fate
In stead of love t^' have purchased hate.
Fa, la la, etc.
Wherefore return thee to the Sea,
And bid farewell to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
The second part
to the same tune.
THus all in vain he did complain,
and no remorce could find:
Y^^ng Palmus through his own disdain
made Sheldra fair unkind:
And she is from him fled and gone,
He laid him in his boat alone,
Fa, la la, etc.
And so betook him to the Sea,
And bade farewell to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
Then from the happy sandy shore,
into the floating waves,
His vessel fraught with brinish tears,
into the maine he laues.
But all in vain, for why he still
With weeping eyes his boat did fill,
Fa, la la, etc.
And lancht his boat into the sea,
And bade farewell to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
Now farewell to my Sheldra fair,
whom I no more shall see:
I mean to leave my life at sea,
by thy inconstancy.
Come Neptune, come to thee I cry.
With thee I Will live, with thee I Will dye.
Fa, la la, etc.
Thus he lancht himself into the sea,
And bade farewell to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
But far from thence he had not gone,
ere Sheldra fair returned,
Whose heart kind pitye made to moan,
such passion in her burned:
But when she to that place arrived,
She found the shore from him deprived.
Fa, la la, etc.
And her dear Palmus now at sea,
H^d bade farewell to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
She then with bitter sighs complaind,
her grief did so abound:
O^t gr^euing that she him disdaind,
whom he so loving found:
But new (alas) 'twas all in vain,
For he was gone by her disdain.
Fa, la la, etc.
Leaving that place to her alone,
Wh^ now laments that he is gone.
Fa, la la, etc.
O wreched Sheldra, then, quoth she,
confess what fond disdain,
H^th wrath caused to fall on thee:
could this long suffering pain,
By thee (alas) so soon forg^t,
Served to thy loves strange hateful lot.
Fa, la la, etc.
And thus to lie, and for him cry,
Whom thou so fondly did deny.
Fa, la la, fa, la la la la.
Who once did truly l^^e, I see,
shall never after hat^
As does too well appears by me,
in my forsaken state.
Alas, I meant my scorn to prove,
By only trial of his love.
Fa la la, fa, la la la la.
Now hapless me, since I do see,
He has forsaken woeful me,
Fa, la la, etc.
Thus all this while in roughest seas,
poor Palmus boat was tossed:
F^^ more his mind with his disease,
because he Sheldra lost.
In mids of this, he her forswears,
He rent his boat and tore his hairs.
Fa, la la, etc.
Threw hope away, for he alas,
Could be no more drowned then he was.
Fa, la la, etc.
Even as his grief had swallowed him,
so strove the greedy waves:
About his boat and ore the brim,
each lofty billow raues:
There is no trust to swelling powers,
That what it may ^t still deuoures,
Fa, la la, etc.
But by the breach the seas might see,
The boat felt more the rage then he.
Fa, la la, etc.
Thus wrackt and scatterd was their state
while he is quite swomme:
Through liquid paths to Thetis gate
by soft degrees went down
Whom when the Nymphs beheld, the Girls,
Soon laid aside their sorting pearls.
Fa, la la, etc.
And up they heau'd him as a guest,
Unlooked for now come to their feast,
Fa, la la, etc.
His case they pitied: but when they
beheld his face right feign,
For very love, into the sea,
they pulld him back again:
So were they with his beauty moved,
For what is fair is son beloved.
Fa, la la, etc.
Thus with Nimphs he lives in the sea,
That left his love at Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, etc.
Then Sheldra fair to Shackley went,
to end her woeful days,
Because young Palmus cast himself
into the floating Seas.
At Shackley-hay did fair Sheldra dye,
And Palmus in the sea does lie,
Fa, la la, etc.
So as they lived so did they dye,
And bade farewell to Shackley-hay.
Fa, la la, fa, la la la la.
FINIS.
