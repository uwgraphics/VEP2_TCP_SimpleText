The Virgins Tragedy: Or The Faithful Maiden, and the Faithless Young man.
Being a true Relation how a young man living in Westminster, fell in Love with
a Maid which had Two hundred pounds to her portion, several promises past
betwixt them, and their Love continued for the space of two years, at the end
whereof, he appointed a day for marriage, but the day being come, he most
disloyally cast her off and forsook her; whose unkindness struck so deep to the
maidens heart, that she fell into swonning and distracted and Fits, and so
miserably languisht for a fortnights time, and then dyed. Desiring on her
Deathbed in the presence of several Neighbors, that her Parents and Relations
would cause her unfortunate Tragedy to be put into Print, which is here done to
fulfill the Will of the Dead; by her brother.

YOung Gallants all and Ladies fair,
and Lovers every where
Mark well this truth which I declare,
which may concern you near,
Regard your vows and promises
which you in Love do bind,
Or else be sure that in this World
small comfort you will find.
Remember Batemans faithless friend,
Now she did prove untrue;
And for reward had in the end
her just deserved due:
For in the night out of her bed,
she carried was away
But to what place it was not known
nor is not to this day.
But to the story now in hand
with grief I must relate
The downfall of a maiden fair
brought to untimely fate;
Occasiond by a faithless wretch
who did her Love disdain
As you may by the sequel find
the same for to be plain.
A Young man late in Westminster
a man of little fame
Did with this maiden fall in Love
at least pretend the same:
Two hundred pounds of good estate
this girl for Portion had.
And but a Taylour he was
of an inferior trade.






With vows and protestations great
this Maid he did allure
Still promising that to the end
his Love it should endure:
Quoth he my dear and only joy
thou needs it not to fear
That ever I will unconstant prove
since that I love thee dear.
The Maiden fair being but young
scarce fifteen pears of age
Believing of his tempting tongue
in Love she did engage:
She freely gave him hand and heart,
not dreading any ill;
But that he would require her for it
and yield the like good will.
For two years space thus did they Live
in Love and friendship pure
Which made poor Isabel believe
it always would endure;
At length a day appointed was
their Nuptials to attend
When at that time it came to pass
he proved a faithless friend.
For why he basely cast her off
denying all was past
At which she fell into a swound
which made her friends agaft:
No help that ever did her good
they used more or less
But from that time she languished
in woe and deep distress.
Where ever she that wretch did see
berest her of her Love
It Is said she swouned presently
his sight her heart did move:
At length into distracted fits
she violently fell
And raved in her frenry mood
most fearfully to tell.
Her friends about her they did flock
to see her in that case
And Neighbors all did pity her
who ever came in that place:
And thus about a fortnights time
it cannot be denied
But she endured misery
and in conclusion dyed.
It Is said that she before her death
did give him a Release
Therefore we trust assuredly
her soul is now at peace:
What guilt upon his conscience lies
best to himself is known
How ere the world may clearly see
the truth that here is shown
This may a warning he to all
young Lovers every one
That they do not unconstant prove
who ever they pitch upon:
Their Oaths and Protestations
the Lord does hear and see
And at the last he will reward
them all assuredly.
The maids Epitaph.
Here within this silent shade
Lies the body of a maid
Who died for Love, and bid adieu
Because her Love proved untrue
