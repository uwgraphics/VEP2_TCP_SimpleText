To the many thousands of Professors of CHRIST'S Religion in all places in this
Kingdom.
Brethren, be not Children in understanding, howbeit in Malice be ye
Children, but in Understanding be Men.

So teaches you the holy Apostle, so advises, exhorts, and prays for you
all. A helper of your Faith, and a Servant of your souls in CHRIST JESUS.

W. Crashaw.

To the right Honorable, the Countess of Devonshire, Grace and Peace.
Right Honorable:
Having known you so ancient a Hearer, and which makes a true Disciple of
Christ, so careful a practiser of Religion, I presumed therefore this
Principal dish of Spiritual meat, would not be unwelcome to you, as I know
it will be more welcome to the World, after so great and good a taster as your
self: And though I may safely say (as one long before me) All Gods dishes are
dainties; yet doubtless this of the Sacraments carries with it a peculiar
Excellency: And I bring it in first, not that there are not others to come in
before it, but for the general use and present necessity of it even at this
time: That this may serve first to stay and comfort many weak and then if it
may be, to satisfy certain curious and squeasie stomachs amongst us: Who
some of them about the Sacrament of Baptism, others in some circumstantiall
matters concerning the Lords Supper, have kindled such a fire of contention in
the Church, as now diverse of them would be glad with many tears to quench if
they knew how. It has pleased God who works even by weak means, by my words
in public and private to satisfy many, if by writing also I may do good to
them that cannot hear me, let the glory be His, the comfort theirs, and the
service acceptable to the Church; So the labor shall willingly be mine: and I
shall take joy and comfort in such courses, in Pulpit and by Pen, Preaching,
writing, and conferring to spend and end the few days I have remaining, and so
to make ready for a better life. And wherein (Madame) any of my labors may be
serviceable to you or yours. Command me,

Your servant in Christ, W. CRASHAVV.

MEAT FOR MEN.
CHAP. 1.
Of Faith.

Question. WHat is the end of a Christian man's life?
Answer. The salvation of his 1. Pet. 1. 9.
Soul.

Q. How can a man be saved? Seeing he is a Sinner?
A. By true Faith in CHRIST. Romans 3. 22, etc. 1. Ioh. 5 4. 1. Sam 8. 3, 4, 5.


Q. How come we by this Faith?
A. It neither comes by Nature from our Parents, nor by human instruction
from any Teachers, nor by imitation of them that have it.

Q. How then must we get it?
A. It is the gift of God. Heb. 12. 2.


Q. Does God give it to all men?
A. No, all men have not Faith: no 2. These. 3. 8
not all that be in the Church.

Q. To whom then belongs it?
A. To those that are the Elect of God. Tit. 1, 1.


Q. How does God give it them?
A. By means of his own appointing 1. Cor. 1. 21
he does begin and increases it.

Q. Is it not then perfect at the first?
A. No: it is true, but not perfect, for Tim. 1, 5. Romans 4. 19. 20. Mat. 14. 31.
Faith is first weak, and afterward becomes a strong Faith.

Chap. 2.
How Faith is wrought.

Question. BY what means does God begin or beget Faith in his Children?
A. Ordinarily, by hearing the Word Rom 10, 12. 1. Cor. 1. 21
preached.

Q. By what parts of his word, the Law or Gospel?
A. By both: for the law begins, and Gal. 3, 23, 24. Romans 7. 24, 25.
the Gospel finisheth that work.

Q. How is that done?
A. The Law prepares the heart by humbling it, and making it a contrite heart.

Q. How does the Law humble the heart?
A. By showing a Man Gods Justice, Romans 7, 9, 10 11.
and his own sins.

Q. And how does the Gospel finish the work of faith?
A. It purifies the heart of man, and Acts. 15. 9. 1. Ioh. 3, 3
makes it a new heart.

Q. How does the Gospel purge the heart?
A. By letting us see the great love of 2. Cor. 2. 14 15 1. Pet. 1. 22
God in Jesus Christ.

Q. Can then the Preachers of the Word give this Faith?
A. No. they preach the Word, but it is 1. Cor. 3, 5, 6, 7.
only God that inspires Faith.

Q. How may a man know that he has true Faith?
A His Soul must be inflamed with Ioh, 7. 37 38
a holy desire to please God, and to do all good works.

Chap. 3.
How Faith is maintained and increased.

Question. HOw does God maintain and increase Faith in his Children.
A. By diverse means, whereof some are principal, and some inferior.

Q. What be the principal means?
A. Two: the continual Preaching of Mat. 28. 19. Acts. 2, 41 1. These. 3. 11
12, 13
the same Word: and the holy use of the Sacraments.

Q. And what be the Inferior means?
A. Three: 1. The reading of Gods Ioh. 5.
Word.

2. Holy conferences with holy men. Heb. 10. 24 25 Lam. 3. 22, 23. 24. Zeph. 3,
5 Psalm. 107.


3. Daily observation of Gods Mercies and Judgments, and meditation upon the
same.

Q. How differ these?
A. The principal are public, and performed by Gods Ministers: the other are
daily to be practiced by our selves in private.

Q. How differ the Word and Sacraments?
A. Thus: the word contains the Heb 13. 20 Romans 4, 11.
Covenants of God: and the Sacraments are seals confirming that Covenant of
our souls.

Again, the Word is the holy and internal Iam. 1. 18. Ioh. 1. 13 1. Pet. 1,
23.
seed of our Regeneration, and by Sacraments we are borne anew, and fed up for
Heaven.

Chap. 4.
Of the Nature of a Sacrament in General.

Question. IS not the Preaching of the Word sufficient for Faith?
A. No* the Sacraments must also be Rom, 3, 1, 10 14
received as Covenants after they be made must be sealed.

Q. What are the Sacraments in their general nature?
A. Outward visible signs of inward, Genesis 17. Exodus, 12.
and invisible graces.

Q. What be they in regard of God?
A. Tokens of his love, pledges of his favor* and seals of his Covenant.

Q. What be they in regard of Christ?
A. Commemorations of his death, and 1. Cor. 11. 24 25, 26
applications of the virtue thereof unto our selves.

Q And what be they in regard of us?
A. Seals of his Covenants betwixt Romans 4, ^^.
God and us: and effectual means to strengthen our Faith, and all other holy
graces in us.

Chap. 5.
Of the Sacraments of the old Testament, and to whom it belongs to ordain a
Sacrament.

Question. MAy the Church ordain Sacraments?
A. No, it belongs to God, as a Exodus 14. Genesis 17.
part of his Prerogative.

Q. Why may God alone ordain Sacraments?
A. Because they be Seals of his Covenants, tokens of his love, and parts of
his worship.

Q. How many be the Sacraments of the new Testament?
A. As many as were the ordinary Sacrament of the old; namely two,

Q. Which were the ordinary Sacraments of the old Testament?
A. Circumcision, and the Passover.

Q. Why do you call them extraordinary. Genesis 17 Exodus 12.

A. Because there were extraordinary?

Q. How did they differ?
A. Thus: the extraordinary were such as God ordained upon some special
occasion, and were to last but for that time Exodus
as the Manna, the Rock, the Cloud, etc.

Q* And what then were the ordinary?
A. Such as were always in force, from the time of their ordination till
Christ's coming.

Chap. 6.
Of the Sacraments of the new Testament, and a comparison with them of the Old.

Question. What be the Sacraments of the new Testament?
A. These two: Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Q. What say you then to Confirmation and marriage, and the rest of the five
Sacraments of the Roman Church?
A. They are some of them Gods holy ordinances, and some of them may be holy
signs, but they were never ordained by Christ for Sacraments, nor ever so used
in the ancient Church.

Q. How do these answer to those of the old Testament?
A. Thus our Baptism answers to 1, Pet. 3, 21
Circumcision, and the Lords Supper succeeds in the room of the Pass over.

Q How differ these from those?
A. Nothing at all in matters of efficacy or power, but only in manner and 1,
Cor. 10, 3 4
circumstance, for those did point at Christ to come, ours at Christ come
already.

Q. What need then was there, to have any other in the new Testament?
A. Because the Sacraments are Seals of Gods Covenant, and its fit that the
Heb. 7, 8, 9.
Covenant being renewed, the Seals also should be new.

Chap. 7.
Of the essential parts of a Sacrament.

Question. What be the essential parts of every Sacrament?
A. Two: one outward and visible, the other inward and invisible represented
thereby.

Q. What outward things be there in every Sacrament?
A. These, 1. A visible Minister, a Man called thereunto of God.

2. Some visible Elements ordained of God.

3. Some outward actions appointed by God.

Q And what spiritual and invisible?
A These: 1. The invisible God represented by the Minister.

2. Some holy grace or blessing represented by the Element.

3. Some gracious works of God represented by the external actions of the
Minister.

Q What circumstances or Ceremonies are required in the Sacraments?
A. Such as the Church shall appoint by lawful authority.

Chap. 8.
Of the Nature and use of Baptism.

Question. What is Baptism?
A. The word signifies a washing Heb. 9. 10
with water.

Q. What is the Sacrament of Baptism?
A. In it own general nature, it is Acts. 2. 38
a washing of the body in the name of the Lord.

Q. And what is it in regard of God?
A. A badge or cognizance which God sets upon such as he takes to be his
servants.

Q. And what is it in regard of Christ?
A. An application of the virtue of his 1. Cor. 5. 7.
bloud-shedding, to cleanse the Soul from the guilt of Original sin.

Q. And what is Baptism in respect of our selves?
A. The Sacrament of our entrance, or Admission into the Covenant and Church of
God.

Q. When may Baptism be administered?
A. At any time if there be cause: but ordinarily when the Congregation is
assembled to worship God.

Chap. 9.
Of the outward and inward things in Baptism.

Question. What is the outward and visible Element in Baptism?
A. Water: and nothing but water.

Q What is the outward action?
A. To wash the Body in water. 1. Pet. 3. 21*


Q. Why is not better liquor to be used, as milk or blood?
A. Because washing is the effect of 1. Cor. 5. 7.
this Sacrament, and those may be better for feeding, but not for washing.

Q. What is the inward and invisible things?
A. The blood of Christ. Reu. 1. 5. 1. Pet. 3. 21:


Q. What is the spiritual action in Baptism?
A. The cleansing or purging of the 1. Ioh. 1, 7 19.
Soul by the blood of Christ.

Q Who is the outward Minister of this Sacrament?
A. He that is also a Minister of the Acts. 2. 41. Mat. 28. 19.
Word, for these 2 must both go together.

Q. Who is the Minister of the inward Baptism?
A. The Lord Jesus, who has washed us from our sins in his blood.

Q Where is the Institution of Baptism set down in the Scripture.
A. In the Gospel, where Christ after his Resurrection commands his Apostles.
Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.
Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son,
and of the holy Ghost.

Chap. 10.
Of the difference betwixt Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Question. What difference is there betwixt Baptism and the Lords Supper?
A. 1. Baptism is the Sacrament of our new birth: and the Lords Supper of our
spiritual growth.

2. Baptism is the Sacrament of our Admission, the Lords Supper of our
Confirmation in the state of Grace.

Q. What other difference is there?
A. This: Baptism must ever be first, and the Lords Supper must come after.

Q. What reason is there for that?
A. It is necessary that one be first borne, before he be fed.

Q. Is there any other difference?
A. Yes: Baptism suffices to be once administered. But the Lords Supper is
often requisite.

Q. What reason may be thereof?
A. Because, it suffices to be once borne, but being borne, it is necessary
to be often fed.

Q. Is there no other difference?
A. Yes, Children may be Baptized, but may not Communicate: as a Child may be
borne, but is not fit for all food.

Chap. 11.
Who are to be Baptized.

Question. WHo are to be Baptized?
A. All that are capable of it? Acts. 2. 41. and 8. 36.


Q. Who are capable of it?
A. All that believe in Christ, and desire Acts, 8. 36. Mark. 16. 16 Acts. 10,
47 Acts. 8. 36 and 2. 41.
Baptism.

Q. How is Baptism to be desired?
A. They that be of years must profess their own faith, and desire it
themselves. Infants of Believers do it by Mark. 10, 13
their Parents, or witnesses and undertakers.

Q. May all challenge Baptism that be thus made capable?
A. Yes, assuredly, for it is the spiritual Acts, 8. 36. Mark. 10 14 15,
birthright to all Believers.

Q. May not Turks nor Jews nor Heathen be Baptized?
A. No, because they believe not in Mark. 16, 16
Christ. but when they do they may.

Q But may the Children of Papists be Baptized?
A. Yes* because they profess Christ Acts. 8. 37.
Jesus according to the Apostles Creed, though they do by other doctrine and
practices adulterate and corrupt it.

Q. Is Baptism necessary to Salvation?
A Not simply necessary to Children, Genesis 17. 12 2. Sam. 12. 18. and. 23.
no more then Circumcision was in the old Testament.

Q. How then is it necessary?
A. To all them that can ask it, and Mark. 16. 16
may have it, it is absolutely necessary, so as without it there is no
Salvation.

Chap. 12.
That Children may be Baptized.

Question. But may Infants be Baptized?
A. Yes, the Infants of believing Parents.

Q. How may that be seeing they have no Faith.
A. That is more then we know, for God may work Faith in their Souls
immediately. John. 3, 8.


Q. But if they have Faith, yet they cannot profess it.
A. Their Parents and witnesses profess it for them. Genesis 17


Q But how can Children enter into a Covenant with God?
A. Very well: for a man may covenant Heb. 7. 9, 10
for himself and his Children, and that act of the Parents is ye Childrens act.

Q. But how is it proved that the Infant of the believing Parents may be
Baptized?
A. By many Arguments:

1 By Gods own practice, who commanded Genesis 17. 9 to 13.
children to be Circumcised at eight days old, in the Old Testament.

2 By the tenor of his Covenant Genesis 17. 7
which runs thus; I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed.

3 By the practice of Christ, who took Mark. 10, 13
them up in his arms and blessed them; now if they be capable of Christ's
blessings, they are capable of Baptism.

4 By the practice of Gods Church, in the purest and best times.

Chap. 13.
Of the Names and Nature of the Lords Supper.

Question. What is the second Sacrament of the new Testament?
A. The Eucharist, or Communion, of the Lords Supper.

Q. What is that?
A. The Sacrament of our Confirmation or Celebration in Gods Church, by which
our Souls are daily fed up in the hope of Heaven, and assurance of Gods love
to us in Christ.

Q. Why is it called the Lords Supper?
A. Because Christ ordained it, and began Mat. 26. 26.
it at his last Supper.

Q. And why is it called the Communion?
A. Because not one alone receives it, as in Baptism, but always many
together 1. Cor. 10. 16. 17.
do Communicate.

Q. But why is it called the Eucharist, or Thanksgiving?
A. Because, as always, so now especially we have cause to offer up our best
thanks to God for our Redemption by Christ,

Q. To whom belongs this Sacrament?
A. To all, that being baptized can and 1. Cor. 11. 28
do prepare themselves for it.

Q. May all such challenge it?
A. Yes, as all Jews had their part in Exodus, 12. 3. 4. 6.
the Passover; and therefore in old time, it was not unworthily called by the
people their Writings, for indeed it does of Right belong unto them.

Chap. 14.
Of the outward Elements in the Lords Supper.

Question. What be the outward visible Elements in the Lords Supper?
A. Bread and Wine. Math. 26. 26 1. Cor. 11. 23


Q. Are there no other?
A. Christ ordained neither more nor fewer, whatsoever the Roman Church says.

Q. Where is the Institution of this Sacrament?
A. In three of the Gospels, and it is Math. 26. Mar. 14 Luke 22 2. Cor. 11.
repeated by Saint Paul, after Christ's ascension.

Q. What is the inward, invisible and spiritual blessing?
A. Christ Jesus his Body and Blood, 1. Cor. 10. 16
with all the merits of the same.

Q. What Bread is fittest in the Sacrament?
A. The best and purest feeding bread.

Q. And what Wine?
A. That which is most cherishing and comfortable, and does most nearly
resemble blood.

Q Are we tied to any fashion or kind of Bread?
A. Such as the Church shall appoint.

Q. Ought there to be Water mingled with the Wine?
A. No: Christ appointed no such thing.

Q. But may it be done at all?
A. Yes, in case of necessity, as:

1. When there is want of wine. 2. When some be so weak, they cannot endure
Wine.
Chap. 15.
Of the Bread, and how it resembles Christ's Body.

Question. Why did the Lord appoint Bread, and Wine, rather then any other
things?
A. For two causes; namely, their generality, and significancie above other
Creatures that are eaten and drunk.

Q. How appears this generality?
A. Thus: of all Creatures that men Mat. 4. 4. Deutr. 8. 3.
eat or drink, these are most generally known, most universally used, and
most easily come by.

Q But what is their significancie?
A. This: that these two creatures do most plainly signify, and most lively
resemble the body and blood of Christ, of 1. Cor. 10. 16 17.
any Creatures in the world.

Q. How does the Bread resemble Christ his Body and sufferings.
A. Most lively: in many particulars: Ioh. 6. 41.
and therefore he is called the Bread that came down from heaven.

Q Show the first resemblance?
A. Bread relisheth all other meats, so Christ gives the true savor and relish
1. Cor. 1. 30
to all other blessings.

Q Declare the second?
A. No meat is wholesome to the Body, without Bread: no more is any blessing
to the Soul, without Christ.

Q. Add the third?
A. Most meats hurt the Body eaten without Bread, and the more outward
blessings without Christ, the more hurtful to the Soul.

Q. What is the next resemblance?
A. Bread and wine alone feeds the Body, Philip. 4, 11 12, 13.
if one have no other meat.

So Christ alone gives feeding and contentment to the Soul, if a man had
nothing else.

Q. What proportion is there else betwixt Bread, and the holy Body of Christ?
A. This Bread strengthens the heart, Psalm, 104. 15.
other meats feeds other humors, but Bread is the strength of Nature.

So other blessings serve for other uses Psalm. Philip, 4, 13,
but Christ is the strength of the Soul.

Q. Go forward is there any more?
A. Yes: Bread is meat for all men, several Deuteronomy. 8. 3
meats are for several sorts of men, but bread for all.

So, some blessings are for some, some 2. Tim, 2, 6, Ioh. 4, 15. 16 1. Ioh. 2, 2
for others, but Christ for all: all that eat him have equal title in him.

Q. Is there yet any other point of resemblance?
A Yes: Bread feeds not till it have past and endured the violence of all the
Elements, and as it were dyed many deaths.

So Christ the Bread that came down Ioh. 3. 14. 15 etc,
from Heaven, is not a Savior of our Souls till he have suffered all kind of
sufferings.

Chap. 16.
Of Wine, and how it resembles the Blood of Christ.

Question. HOw does the Wine resemble the Blood of Christ?
A. First, in name and color, being therefore called the blood of the grape:

Q. And is not that all?
A. No, it is also like in nature and opperation, for first, Wine is not Wine
till it be pressed out of the grape

So Christ's blood is not effectual, but Heb. 9, 12. 13, 14
being pressed out of his blessed body.

Q. Show the next resemblance?
A. Wine is fit drink for the sorrowful Prou. 31, 6,
and heavy hearted man-

So Christ's blood is sweetest to the sorrowful Psalm. 51, 17. Math. 9. 13
Soul, and humbled heart.

Q. Is there any other resemblance?
A. Yes. Wine cherishes the heart of Psalm, 104, 15
man.

So the Spiritual Wine, the blood of Christ comforts the distressed conscience.

Q. It seems then the people ought to have Wine as well as the Bread?
A. Yea, rather they then the Clergy, Math. 9. 12.
as weak ones have more need of Wine then the strong and healthful.

Q. It seems the people have need of it, but by what right can they challenge
it?
A. By a double right, 1. By the institution Math 26. 26 27. 28. 1. Cor. 11. 25
and 28.
of Christ, who so ordained it, 2. By the practice of the Primitive Church, for
1000. years after Christ.

Chap. 17.
Of the outward actions in the Lords Supper.

Question. What be the outward actions to be performed in the Lords Supper?
A. They be of two sorts: some to be done by the Minister, some by the Receiver.

Q. What is the Minister to do?
A. Four things.

1. To take Bread and Wine. Mat. 26. 26. etc.
2. To bless them. 3. To break the Bread, and pour out the Wine. 1. Cor. 11.
26. etc.
4. To give them to the Communicants, to every one severally.
Q. And what belongs to the Receiver?
A. Two things.

1. To take them both. Mat. 26. 26. etc. 1. Cor. 11. 23 etc.
2. To eat and drink them in remembrance of the breaking of Christ's body, and
shedding of his blood.
Q. And is not the Minister to hold it up, to be seen and worshipped of the
people.
A. No, Christ commanded no such thing, but it came in together with Idolatry.

Q. But is not the people to worship it when it is consecrated?
A. No, that were foul Idolatry to Deuteronomy. 2. 2
worship Bread?

Q. But it is not Bread but God?
A. Nay, if it were God it might not be eaten with the Mouth.

Q. But may not the people keep part of it, and carry it home?
A. No, it is impiety, and superstition: and Christ commanded no more, but to
take and eat.

Chap. 18.
Of the inward actions in the Lords Supper.

Question. What be the spiritual and inward actions in the Sacrament?
A. Answerable to the outward: some belong to the Giver, some to the Receiver.

Q Who is the invisible Minister here?
A. God the Father, giving Christ unto Romans 8. 32.
us.

Q. What are the actions he does?
A. Four: Answerable to the four outward things done by the Minister.

1 He destinates Christ to be our Savior, represented by the Ministers taking
of bread and wine.

2 He sanctifies Christ's humanity, and Ioh. 3, 34
furnishes it with holiness: shadowed by the Ministers blessing of the
Eliments.

3 He gives his Son to dye, and to be Romans 8, 32*
broken for us, lively resembled in breaking the Bread and pouring out the Wine.

4 He offers that crucified Son, to 1. Cor. 1. 30
every believing soul, as is most comfortably represented unto us in the
Ministers giving of the broken bread to each Communicant.

Q. And what be the spiritual actions of the Receiver?
A. Spiritually by Faith, and Love, to John, 9. 53, etc. to 56*
take and eat him, that is to make him our own, as Bread is when a man has
eaten it, and receives life and strength by it.

Chap. 19.
What Preparation is requisite in regard of God.

Question. Who receive benefit by this Sacrament?
A. The worthy Receiver: Many receive it, but none else receive benefit by it.

Q. Who is the worthy Receiver hereof?
A. He that believing in Christ, does rightly prepare himself thereunto.

Q. What is requisite to a right preparation?
A. Two sorts of things:

1 Some betwixt God and our selves. 2 Some betwixt our neighbors and us.
Q. What is required in regard of God?
A. Seven things:

1. A competent measure of knowledge 1, Chr. 28. 9
of the principles of Religion. 2. A serious examination of our hearts 2. Cor.
13. 5 Gal. 6. 4.
and lives, to know our corruptions and sins. 3. True confession of them all
to God Psalm, 51. 4. James 5. 16.
and to man also where we find need. 4 A clensing of our hearts by renewing
Iam. 4* 8 Exodus 12. 8.
of our repentance. 5 A trimming of our souls by holy resolutions, Revel. 21.
2. Ierem.
and love of virtue. 6 A raising up of our hearts to a meditation i. Sam. 12. 24
of Gods mercies to us in Christ. 7 A resolution to become new creatures, 2.
Th. 5. 23.
and to practice new obedience every day more and more.
Chap. 20.
What preperation is requisite in regard of our Brethren.

Question. What preparation is fit in respect of our Neighbors?
A. To be in Christian love and charity Exodus 12. 8. Heb. 12. 14.
with all men: and at peace also if it be possible.

Q. How can we love evil men?
A. We must love good men in God, Math. 5.
and evil men for God: yea though they be our cruel enemies.

Q* What shall they do that have Law saite^?
A. Either presently end them, or 1. Cor. 6.
learn to go to Law without breach of Charity.

Q. How may one do so?
A. Thus:

1 Never going to Law for small things. Prou.
2 Making Law the last means of getting right. 3 To be ever ready to make a
quiet end Psalm, 34. 14.
to some loss.
Q. What if a man see he cannot go to Law without breach of Charity?
A. Till he can, he must have no John, 6. 27,
suits, nor rob God of his worship to enrich himself.

Q. What must he do that is at variance with another?
A. Seek to be reconciled. Mat. 5.


Q. What if the other will not be reconciled?
A. Let him show himself ready for Gal. 6. 5.
his part, and God will accept him: and leave the other to God and the Church
to deal withal.

Chap. 21.
Of the Circumstanes of this Sacrament.

Question. Whether is it necessary to receive fasting?
A. It is convenient, not necessary.

Q. How appears that?
A. Thus:

1 If one be not well, God says he will Math. 9. 3,
have mercy and not Sacrifice. 2 Because meat defiles not a man. 3 In the
primitive Church they received at any time, day or night.
Q. Must we follow Christ in all things toucbing this Sacrament?
A. For matter of substance we must, but for circumstances not so.

Q. What be the substantial matters in this Sacrament?
A. Four: 2. Persons, and 2. things.

Q What be the Persons?
A, A Minister qualified to give it, and a worthy Receiver to take it.

Q* What be the the things?
A. The Elements, and the actions to be done about those Elements.

These may not be altered.

Q. But why are we not tied also to follow Christ, in the circumstances of
time, place, gesture, number, sex, unleavened Bread, etc.
A. Because Christ was tied to the Circumstances of the Passe-ouer, so are not
we.

Q. Why was Christ bound to keep the Pass over?
A. Because he was a Jew borne, and came to fulfill all righteousness.

Q. But the Passe-ouer was a Ceremony?
A. True: but the Ceremonicall Law was in sorce until Christ dyed.

Chap 22.
That kneeling is not only lawful but conuement and commendable.

Question. Who then is to appoint the Circumstances for this Sacrament?
A. The Church has power to do it.

Q. How appears?
A. Because She is the Spouse, and Math. 28. 20
has the Spirit and power of Christ.

Q What time has the Church appointed as best?
A. The morning, because we are then fittest for any great or good action. Psalm.


Q. And what place?
A. The public Congregation, except in case of necessity. Psalm, 40


Q And what gesture is best and fittest?
A. The gesture of most Humility; namely, kneeling.

Q* Why is kneeling the best beseeming gesture?
A Because we then show the Lords 1. Cor. 11. 28
death, who dyed by our means, and for our fault: therefore we may not show
that death, but with all humility.

Q. But is it not Idolatry to kneel to the Bread?
A. We kneel to no Bread, but only James.
to God, to whom also we then pray.

Q. But did not the Pope bring in kneeling, together with Transubstantiation?
A. No, it was used by devout and holy Christians long before: as may appear
in the end of this Book.

Q. But is it not a Feast, and therefore more fit to sit then kneel?
A. First, the Scripture calls it not a 1 Cor. 11. 28
Feast, but a commemoration of the Lords death.

Secondly, if it be a Feast, its like a Funeral feast where is cause of
Sorrow as well as Joy.

Thirdly, the conclusion certainly is a 1. Cor. 11. 28
Feast, but not the breaking, giving, and taking: That is a showing of the
Lords death, and therefore it is to be done kneeling: But that done, then it is
a Communion and Loue-feast, and then we may either sit and sing, or stand and
praise 1 Cor. 10. 16
GOD.

Q. But why should we alter the gesture that Christ used?
A. It is not certain Christ gave it them sitting, the Text says not so.

Again, Saint Paul repeating all he received 2 Cor. 11. 23
of Christ, says not a word of any gesture.

Third, If it were certain, yet the Church upon good cause might as well alter
it, as the Bread, time, place etc.

Q. What is to be thought of them that wilfully refuse to kneel?
A. They are like rebellious, and proud children, that will take upon them to
overrule their Mother.

Q. May one alone Communicate?
A. No, there must be a convenient 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17.
number, else it is no Communion.

Chap* 23.
What a Christian ought to do after he has Received.

Question. WHat is to be done, when we have Received?
A. In the Church we are to give God Heb. 13. 15. 1. Cor. 16. Heb. 3. 16.
thanks, with the Congregation, and to offer up our Aims for the poor.

Q Who are to give alms when they receive?
A. All that come to take part in Christ, Wives, women, and servants, are all
to give something to Christ's poor members, Gal. 3. 28.
seeing he gives himself to all without difference.

Q. How and what is every one to give?
A. According to the necessities of the 2. Cor. 8. 2. and 9. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2.
poor, and as God has blessed thee that Month, or since thou did last
receive.

Q And what is to be done at home?
A. Retire your selves in private, and meditate upon the infinite mercy of God,
in giving Christ to dye for our sins, and Psalm. 44. Math. 6. 6. 1. These. 4. 12
to beg grace, that daily we may walk worthy of it.

Q* But as we received together in the Church, it is not fit to go together
that day to drink and make merry?
A. Thankfulness is necessary, and moderate mirth is lawful, but as this is
1. These. 5. 18 Philip. 3. Ioh. 6. 2.
a Spiritual feast, so our joy that day is to be Spiritual: There be other
days enough for the body.
