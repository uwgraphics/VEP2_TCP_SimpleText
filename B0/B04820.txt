The Maidens Delight: OR, A dainty New Dialogue.
A Vaporing Gallant came the Maid to woo
But she denied and said she would not do
He profferred Ribbans, Gloves, and gay gold Rings
But she refused all manner of such things.
She said the greatest comfort of her life
Was to be made some honest Trades-mans wife.
To the Tune of, Behold the man with a glass in his hand. Or, The Mountebank of
York.




Man. I am a Jovial Batcheler,
and free from care and strife,
I nothing in the world do want
and yet I want a wife:
Therefore sweet Cupid guide me,
and help me to a Love,
That may both kind and loving be
and honest to me prove.
It Is known to all my neighbors I
am one and twenty years old,
And I have store and plenty of
white Silver and red Gold,
I have both goods and Cattle,
I have both house and Land,
I have my horse, my Hawk, my hound,
and all things at command
My hat is made of Beaver brave,
my hand of Flaunders Lace,
My golden Belt about my neck,
my person for to grace:
My silver haunched Rapier
both make a gallant show,
And I am well accounted of
by all that do me know,
I have my knots of Ribbans brave
along my Cod-peice tide
I have my goulden fancies
meet round at every side
So high as is my pocket holes,
deny it he that can
Let all that sees me judge if I
am not a proper man
And now sweet Betty I am come
a wooing unto thee,
I prithee tell me out of hand
if thou can fancy me,
If thou can truly love me
i will take thee to my wife,
And thou shall surely always live,
A sweet contented life.
I Will furnish thee with rare delights,
as Ribbans and gold rings
Perfumed, Gloves and Bracelets
and such like costly things
With a Bever hat and a taffety scarf fine
and a new-fashion silken gown
So thou shall be as brave a Girl.
as any in the town

The second part,
to the same Tune.


Maid. GOod Sir I thank you kindly for
your proffered courtesy
But this I tell you plainly here
in truth and verity
That I shall never love you
whilst I on earth remain
Therefore forbear and say no more
spend not your breath in vain.
It Is not your cunning speeches that
shall tempt me unto sin
For all your wealth and riches sir,
I value not a pin
I will not wed a Prodigal
though he be never so brave
But if ever I marry whilst I live,
some Tradesman I will have.
A Prodigal will domineer,
and soon consume his store,
Which being gone he knows not how
nor which way to get more
But the brave resolved tradesman
is free from such like sorrow
If he wants money over night,
he will work for more next morrow
A spend-thrift that consumes
and sells his land for gold
Is very like to live in want
or beg when he is old
But the Noble-minded tradesman,
his work goes for ward still
For he has meat and drink enuf,
and al things else at will.
So now you honest Batchelers
you partly know my mind
If I can with a Tradesman meet,
that will to me prove kind
If that he takes me to his wife,
I will him dearly love,
And i will be as faithful unto him
as is the Turtle Dove.
I do confess gay Ribands
becomes the britches fine,
And that the golden fancies
will make the Cod-peice shine
But before I will be married
to such a Prodigal
I Will live a Maid and dye a Maid,
and that's a word for all.

Man. Farewell you scornful minion
I bid thee now adue
I never do intend to come,
again to trouble you,
I Will rest my self contented
until that I can find
A wife that is more fitting and
agreeable to my mind.

Maid. Why then farewell proud Coxcom^
and this I tell thee plain
Thy pride and thy ambition,
I hold in much disdain,
Rather then such a jack as thou,
should be my company keeper,
I Will marry with a Beggar-man
or with a Chimney-Sweeper.

Finis.
