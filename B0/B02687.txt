A DIALOGUE Between Ald John M'clatchy, and Young Willie Ha, about the Marriage
of his Daughter Maggy M'clatchy.
To an Excellent New Tune.
THE Meal was dear short shine,
When they were Married together;
Ann Maggy she was in her prime,
When Willy made Courtship till her.
Two Pistols Charged be-guess,
To give the Courtier a Shot,
Ann sine came ben the Lass,
We Swats drawn frae the Butt:
He first spears at the Good Man,
Ann sine at Jean her Mither,
Gin ye'll gi'e us a bit Land,
We'll Buckle our selves together.
Old Man. My Daughter ye shall ha'e
I Will gi'e ye her be the Hann,
But we my Wife I man quat
Gin I quat we my Lann;
But your Tocher shall be good,
I Will never gang nen the meek,
The Lass bin in her Snood,
And Cromy that kens the Stake;
We an ald Bedding of Clea's,
Was left me by my Mither,
They Are geet-black over we fleas
You may H -- dle in them together.

Young Man. A Bargain it shall be,
But ye man mend your Hann,
Ann think on Modesty;
Gin ye'll no' quat we your Lann,
We are but young ye ken,
Ann now we are ga^n together,
A House is But and Ben,
Ann Cromie she wants her Fadder;
The Bairns are coming on,
Ann they will cry on there Mither,
We ha'e neither Pot nor Pan,
But four bair Legs together.

Old Man. Thou shall ha'e Tocher aneugh,
Ann that thou need not fear,
Two good stilts to the Pleugh,
Ann thou thy self man stear;
Thou'st ha'e two good ald pocks,
That was enst made of the Tweel,
The teen to had the Groats,
The tither to had the Meal:
We an ald Kissed made of wans
I Will give thee to thy Coffer,
We eiken woddie bans,
And that may had your Tocher.

Young Man. Consider now Good Man,
I ha'e but barrow'd geer,
The Beast that I Ride on,
Is Sanny Wilson's Mere;
But as soon as I began heem,
I Will take me to my Cutts,
The Saddle is nean of my ain,
Ann these are barraw'd Boots,
The Clock is Geordie Wat's,
That gars me look so Cruss,
Fie fill us a Cog o'Swats
We'll make ne ma^e toomrouss.

Old Man. Thou art an onest Lad,
For telling me so plain,
I Married when little I had,
Of Gear that was my ain;
Good-sooth if it be se,
The Bride she man come forth,
Though a the gear she has,
It is but little worth;
A Briddle it shall be,
Se spear at Jean her Mither,
Content am I, quoth she,
Fie gar the Lass come hither;
The Bride lap in to the Bed,
Ann the Bridgroom ged till her
The Fiddler crap in to the mids
Ann they H -- dled altogether.

FINIS.
