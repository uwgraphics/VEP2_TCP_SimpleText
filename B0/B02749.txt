The Doting Old DAD, OR, The Unequal Match betwixt a Rich Muckworm of Fourscore
and Ten, and a Young Lass scarce Nineteen.
When Dads thus Old, whose Blood is cold,
young Damsels seeks to Wed;
For their neglect, they may expect
Horns grafted on their Head.
To the Tune of, All Trades.
This may be Printed, R. P.







THere was a young Damsel of fate,
was Wooed by a Dad very Old,
He had a right worthy Estate,
besides store of Silver and Gold:
His Service he proffered her then,
yet he was as pale as a Ghost,
He being full Fourscore and Ten,
and she was but Nineteen at most:
But ever when he drew nigh,
the Damsel would straight reply;
I Will never have you, for what can you do?
O fie upon Fumblers, fie.
Although I am wrinckled and Lean,
yet I will be loving to thee,
And deck thee as fine as a Queen,
if thou will be Married to me:
Both Silver and Gold I have store,
and yet though thy Portion is small,
If I had a thousand times more,
yet you should be Mistress of all:
But ever when he drew nigh,
the Damsel would straight Reply,
I Will never have you, for what can you do?
O fie upon Fumblers, fie,
I tell thee my amorous Girl,
if that thou will he but my Bride,
I Will give thee Rich Jewels and Pearl,
and twenty new Nick-knacks beside:
A Tower and Top-knot so fine,
a Mask and a delicate Fan;
O tell me now will thou be mine,
endeavor to love an Old Man:
But ever when he, etc.
He proffered her still to advance her,
but thus with Discretion, said she,
You re-Old enough to be my Grandsir,
and therefore no Husband for me:
For when I behold your bald Pate,
and straggling Hairs white and gray,
O then at a sorrowful rate,
I weeping and sighing, shall say:
O what a hard Fortune have I,
though Married, a Maiden must dye;
The more is my grief, I see no relief,
O fie upon Fumblers, fie.
Now hearing the Damsels intent,
and finding he could not prevail,
Away to her Mother he went,
and told her a pitiful Tate:
Your Daughter she is in a rage,
and all my kind proffers will not heed,
Besides, she despises my Age,
which ought to be Honored indeed:
For when to her I draw nigh,
she makes this strange Reply;
I Will never have you, for what can you do?
O fie upon Fumblers, fie.
She straight for her Daughter did send,
before the Old Man went away,
In duty she straight did attend,
to hear what her Mother would say:
My Daughter, you well understand,
that he has good Treasure enuff,
In Money, nay, Cattle and Land,
with abundance of good Household Stuff:
Then Daughter tell me but why,
you will not freely-comply?
Said she, he is Old, his Blood it is cold,
O fie upon Fumblers, fie.
Her Mother did hear her therefore
she straightway did call her asid^
You know he has Riches great st^^^
and therefore you must he his B^^^^^
And as for the pleasure of Youth,
if he cannot get Daughter or So^
Believe me, I Would have you, in tru^^
do e'ne as your Mother has done
For when my Old Dad would deny,
to yield me a daily supply,
I still had a Friend my Will to attend
for fie upon Fumblers, fie.
Thus you may your sorrows relief
although an Old Fumblers Wif^
It is easy to make him believe
you love him as dear as ^our life
You need not his Jealousy dread,
if that you will make but each nig^
A Cordial, and put him to Bed,
then kiss with a Gallant all night
For Daughter, I cannot deny,
but Wives may want a supply,
Which if it be so, abroad we must go,
for fie upon Fumblers, fie.
The Damsel she gave her Consent,
and they the next morning was (...)
The day was in Merriment spent,
at length they did hurry to Bed:
And then said the Feeble Old Man,
thy Fancy I Would willingly feed,
But can do no more than I can,
accept of the Will for the Deed.
In Bed he Grunting does I, e,
which makes her often Reply,
I still am a Maid, and shall be, she said,
O fie upon Fumblers, fie.
FINIS.
