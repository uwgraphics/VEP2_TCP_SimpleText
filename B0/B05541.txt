A PROCLAMATION Appointing some Foreign species of Gold and Silver to be
Current.
CHARLES by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith,
To Our Lion King at Arms, and his Brethren Heralds, Macers, Pursevants, and
Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly, and severally,
specially constitute, Greeting;
Forasmuch as the Lords of Our Privy Council, having taken to their
Consideration a Petition presented by the Provost of Edinburgh, in Name, and by
Warrant of the Royal Burrowes of this Kingdom, Representing, as one of the
great causes of the Decay of Commerce amongst all Qualities of people of this
Kingdom, and the deadness of the Foreign and Inland Trade thereof, to be the
great scarcity of the stock of Coin, and of all manner of species of Money in
this Kingdom, that does much incommodate all manner of Dealers, who are
necessitate to deal upon Credit, wanting the supplies of species of money to
maintain the same: which Scarcity having been occasioned by the small
Quantities of Silver that used to be coined formerly In Our Mint, before Our
late happy Restoration, and the frequent Exportation even of the said small
Quantities into Foreign parts; And having remitted the Consideration of the
foresaid Petition to a Commitee of their number, for preparing the said matter,
impowering them to confer with the Officers of our Mint, and these of the
Burrowes who were entrusted with the said Petition, and to take exact trial of
the fineness of Foreign Coin both of Gold and silver; who having accordingly
conferred with these of the said Burrowes, and Officers of Our Mint, and
having seen exact Trial taken of the Intrinsic Finenesse and Value of several
sorts of foreign Coin, by the subtle essay taken in their presence, did make
report, that the Spanish and Dutch Duccatoon, the Spanish Milrynd and French
Crown, are much finer than other foreign Coin now presently current in this
Kingdom. W E Therefore, being unwilling to restrain the foreign coins
presently current, while our proper coin of this Kingdom is so small, and so
much exported because of its fineness; And finding it the better way to keep
out course foreign coin, by allowing the said finer foreign Coin to be
current: And considering, that the foresaids species of money are the Coin of
these places with which this Kingdom has most considerable Trade, and will be
a great mean to enable Merchants to return money for the export of this
Kingdom: Whereas if the Coin of these places be not current here, their Ships
must return light, or laden with foreign Commodities of less use for this
Kingdom, to balance their whole expert: Have thought fit, with advice of Our
Privy Council, to declare and ordain, and by the Tenor hereof do declare and
ordain, That the particular species of Foreign Coin, above and after
mentioned, shall have course within this Kingdom at the rates following, viz.
The Spanish and Dutch Duccatoon to pass current amongst all Our subjects, for
three pounds ten shillings scots: The Spanish Milrynd, for two pounds seventeen
shillings scots: And the French Crown for two pounds sixteen shillings. And
also We considering, that there has been an Surcease, and long time since the
coining of any Gold in this Kingdom, and that the species of all Old Gold is
transported, and little Foreign Gold imported; And for the further
encouragement of the Merchants in this Kingdom, concerned in the Spanish and
Dutch Trades, to make the Returns of their yearly Export and Effects in such
species of Gold Coins as these Countries do afford; Do hereby also, with
Advice foresaid, Ordain, and Declare, the Quadruple Spanish Pistol, or piece of
eight of Gold, to have course amongst our Subjects of this Kingdom, at the rate
of forty two pounds scots the piece, the same being of usual weight, of twenty
one Deniers: And also the smaller species of the said Gold Pistol down-ward, to
pass at the said Rates proportionally: As likewise, the Hungary, Dutch, and
Fleemish Duccat of Gold weighing two Deniers, fifteen Grains, to pass, and
have course for five pounds twelve shillings scots, The same being of the said
weight. And to the effect all Our Leiges may have notice hereof, Our Will is,
and We charge you strictly, and command, that incontinent these Our Letters
seen, ye pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, and
thereat, in Our Name and Authority, by open Proclamation, make Publication of
the Premises.
