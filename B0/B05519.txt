A PROCLAMATION,
HOLYRUDE-HOUSE, the fourteenth day of January, one thousand six hundred and
seventy.
FOrasmuch as there have been of late imported into this Kingdom, great numbers
of these Dollars commonly called Leg-Dollars, having the impression of a Man in
Arms with one Leg, and a Shield containing a Coat of Arms covering the other
Leg upon the one side, which do usually pass at the rate of fifty eight
shillings Scots money: And seeing that upon trial of the intrinsic worth and
value thereof, they are found to fall short of the foresaid rate; and that in
the United Provinces where the said Dollars are coined, they pass only at the
rate of Cross-Dollars. Therefore, and for preventing any further prejudice
which the Lieges may sustain there-through, the Kings Majesty, with advice of
His Privy Council, does Declare, That (the Rex or Bank-Dollar now passing at
fifty eight shillings Scots) the true and just rate and price at which the
foresaid Leg-Dollars ought to pass and be current in this Kingdom, is fifty six
shillings Scots money; and that none of His Majesty's Subjects shall hereafter
be holden and obliged to take or receive these Leg-Dollars, in any payment of
moneys to be made to them, at any higher rate then fifty six shillings, money
foresaid, the piece, wherever the same have been coined: As also, that the
Cross-Dollars do pass in this Kingdom after this day at fifty six shillings
Scots. And Ordains these presents to be printed, and published at the
Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, that none pretend
ignorance.
