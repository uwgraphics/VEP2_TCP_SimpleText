A Brief MEMORIAL OF THE BIBLE: OR, A SUMMARY OF The Chief Matters contained in
every Chapter of the Old and New Testament.

Done into Meter for the Help of Memory, BY J. C. M. A.

LONDON, Printed by J. Astwood for Thomas Parkhurst, at the Bible and Three
Crowns at the lower end of Cheapside, near Mercers-Chappel. 1688.

TO THE READER.
THe Use and End of this Metrical Epitome, being only to help thy Memory in
retaining and calling to Mind the matters contained in the several Chapters of
the Old and New Testament, ought in all Justice to be a sufficient Apology for
the Faults of its Poetry: For it is impossible, within the compass of one
single Verse or Line, to express with equal perspicuity or smoothness the
Contents of Chapters, so unequal both in length and variety.

In the Historical Part, I am bold to hope that there is not much Pretermitted;
but the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and many Chapters in the Prophets,
consisting of various and unconnected Sentences, are no way reducible to any
one certain Head; and therefore I held my self contented to Characterize them
by some remarkable Sentence in them, and have added in the Margin the Numerals
of the Verses where such Sentences are to be found.

Upon the whole, if it may pass for an Essay, and excite others to do it
better; and in the mean time be subservient to Piety, in promoting the
Knowledge and Practice of the Holy Scriptures, too much neglected and forgotten
in this Sinful Age, I shall have my End.
