THE THREE Buxome Maids of Yoel: OR, The Pleasant Entreague betwixt them and a
Country Sive-maker, who left a large Reckning to pay for their Pissing in the
Sive.
To the Tune of, The Guinny wins her.
Licensed according to Order.





PRay listen to this Ditty,
for it will make you merry,
Three Lasses fair and pretty,
was treated with canary,
In-Yoel by a loving Friend,
Who, it seems, did cry, Did Sides to mend;
a jolly bonny Blade,
and as he cried his trade,
it was his chance to meet,
these Lasses in the street,
which he resolved to tread
With wine for they were in come, bri^^^ and fine.
The first was mincing Sarah,
the second buxome Betty,
The third young modest Marry,
all Lasses fair and pretty;
With him they to a Tavern went;
For to spend the day in sweet content;
the Side-maker and they,
would froliek, sport and play,
and call for liquour store,
making the Tavern roar;
the Side-maker he swore
That he, would tickle there above the knee.
Brisk Betty did not fear him,
but bid him use his pleasure,
And straight the sat down near him,
he kill her out of measure;
At which young Sarah seemed to frown,
And her tears in sorrow trickl'd down,
because he kissed her first,
who was the very worst;
But pretty Girls, said he,
let us lovingly agree,
and do not press on me
So fast, I Will serve you all alike at last.
Quoth Mary, I admire
your tender kind embraces,
It hithtens our desire,
when we are joining faces;
By true experience this I know,
Therefore I declare before we go,
the Side-maker shall be,
both loving, kind and free.
Sweet Lasses, he replied,
nothing shall be denied,
if with a flowing tide
You Will fill, this Sive here with your water-mill.
Bess knew it must he vented,
she was not for denying,
The rest likewise consented,
their floodgates they let flying;
He held the Sive, they poured it in,
Betty's engine played above his chin,
and blinded both his eyes,
he in a passion cries,
I cannot endure the smart,
it cuts me to the heart;
with that he did depart
Away, and left them all the shot to pay.
They laughed to see him scour,
and called for more canary;
Then waiting there an hour,
at length quoth modest Mary,
I fear that he will come no more,
Therefore let us call to knew the score;
to this they straight agreed,
the Drawer came with speed,
and cried without delay,
you must ten shillings pay,
before you go your way,
It Is true, this made the Lasses all look ble^^.
Though joys they had been reaping,
yet seeing they were worsted,
Poor Girls, they feel a weeping,
and wanted to be trusted;
The Drawer he began to rave,
He would present satisfaction have;
they having then no stock,
Each Damsel pawned her smook,
which was of dowlas fine;
to pay for bread and wine,
then went away at nine,
And swore, they would never piss in Sives no more.
