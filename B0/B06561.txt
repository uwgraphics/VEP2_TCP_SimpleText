A Serious Discourse between two Lovers.
This Song will teach young Men to woo,
And show young Maidens what to do;
Nay it will learn them to be cunning too,
To the tune of, When Sol will cast no Light, Or, Deep in Love. J. Wade.

MY pretty little Rogue
do but come hither,
With thee I Will not collogue,
if thou wilt consider,
The pains for thee I Have took,
Cupid so wounded me,
But now I Am in the Brook,
if thou do not love me.
I Will forsake all my Kin,
Father and Mother
I value not a Pin,
or any other,
It Is only thy sweet face,
the which does move me.
And I think thou have some grace,
and thou wilt love me.
Riches I Will promise none,
nor no great Treasure,
Because I Will do no wrong,
to thee my Pleasure;
But all that e're I have
thou shall command it,
And I Will maintain thee brave,
thou'st understand it,
My Word nor yet my Oath
shall not be broken,
Then take this suggared kiss
in sign of Loves Token.
My heart is firm and true,
then let pity move thee,
I Will not seek for a new,
if thou wilt but love me.

The Maid. GOod Sir I thank you fine
for what is spoken,
But all is non gold that shines,
and as for your token,
I shall not it receive,
though you do prove me,
My joy thou wilt nere bereave,
for I cannot love thee.
Young men can swear and lie,
but who will believe them.
All goodness they defy,
and it nere grieves them.
Only to tempt a Maid
by their delusion,
Therefore I am afraid
'twill breed confusion.
A Maid had need beware
that does mean honest,
Lest she fall in a snare,
when they do promise;
For they will vow and swear
they will never leave you,
But when they know your mind,
then they will deceive you.
Therefore I will be wise,
lest I be taken,
In a fools Paradise,
and then be forsaken,
I Will put no trust in man
to one nor other,
Let them do what they can,
if it were my brother.

The Man. My Dear you do but jest,
I may boldly speak it,
Of all I love thee best,
prithee so take it,
There is no flesh alive,
ever shall move me;
If thou will be my wife,
I Will dearly love thee.
Servants on thee shall tend,
and come at thy pleasure,
For I will be thy friend,
to bring thee Treasure.
What can thee wish for more?
then do but prove me,
And thou shall plainly find
how dear I love thee.
For means thou shall not want,
If I do gain thee.
I have good house and land,
for to maintain thee.
I have good Sheep in the field,
and Beasts that is proving.
All is at thy command,
if thou wilt be loving.
I Will give thee gold my Dear,
I Will give thee Money,
Then thou needs not to fear,
I Will be thy honey.
No Lady in the Land,
ever shall move me,
Thou Wilt have my heart and hand,
if thou wilt but love me.

The Maid. Your words are very fair,
I much commend you,
Seeing you are so rare,
thus I Will befriend you.
Though at first I was coy,
'twas but to prove thee,
Yet now I Will be thy joy,
and dearly love thee,
The Young man hearing this,
by the hand took her,
The bargain sealed with a kiss,
he nere forsook her,
But strait to Church they went,
things were so carried,
He gave his Love content,
when they was married.
Thus all young Maids may find,
young man are honest,
If they bear the like mind,
true to their promise.
But if they falsify,
who can believe them,
And when they have lost their Loves,
then it does grieve them.
