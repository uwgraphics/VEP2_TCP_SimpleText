THE NEW BALOVV:
OR, A Wenches Lamentation for the loss of her Sweetheart: he having left her
with a Babe to play her, being the Fruits of her Folly.

The Tune is Balow.
BAlow, my Babe, weep not for me:
Whose greatest grief's for wronging thee.
But pity her deserved smart,
Who can but blame her own kind heart,
For trusting to a flattering friend;
The fairest tongue the falsest mind.
Balow, me babe, etc.
Balow my Babe, ly still and sleep,
It grieves me sore to hear thee weep:
If thou be still I will be glad,
Thy weeping makes the mother sad:
Balow, my boy, thy mothers joy,
Thy father wrought me great annoy.
Balow, balow, etc.
First when he came to court my love,
With sugared words be did me move;
His flattering and fained cheer,
To me that time did not appear.
But now, I see that cruel be,
Cares neither foe my babe not me,
Balow, balow, etc.
I cannot choose but love him still.
Although that he bath done me ill,
For he has stolen away my heart,
And from him it cannot depart:
In well or woe, where ere he go,
I Will love him though he be my fo.
Balow, Balow, etc.
But peace my comfort, curse not him
Who now in seas of grief does swim
Perhaps of death: for who can tell,
Whether the Judge of heaven or hell,
By some predestined death,
Revenging me, has stopped his breath.
Balow, Balow, etc.
If I were near those fa;^^l bounds,
Where he ly groaning in his wounds:
Repeating as he pants for breath.
Her name that wounds more deep then death
O then what women's heart so strong
Would not forget the greatest wrong.
Balow, balow, etc.
If linen lack, for my loves sake,
Whom once I loved: then would I take
My smeek even from my body mere,
And wrap him in that winding sheet,
Ay me vow happy had I bin,
If he had nere he on wrapped therein.
Balow, balow, etc.
Balow my babe, space thou thy tears,
^ntil thou come to wit and years,
Thy griefs are gathering to a sum,
Heaven grant thee patience till they come,
A mothers fault a fathers shame,
A hapless state, a bastards name.
Balow, balow, etc.
Be still my babe, and sleep a while,
And when thou wakes then sweatly smiles
But smile not as thy father did
To cusen maids: O heaven forbid
And yet into thy Face I see
Thy father dear which tempted me,
Balow, balow, etc.
Balow my babe. O follow not
His faithless steps who thee begot
Nor glory in a maids disgrace,
For thou art his too much, alace,
And in the looking eyes read
Who ever threw my maiden head.
Balow, balow, etc.
O if I were a maid again,
All young men's flatteries I Would refraid:
Because unto my grief I find,
That they are faithless and unkind,
Their tempting terms has been my harm
Bear witness babe lies in my arm
Balow, balow, etc.
Balow my babe, spare yet thy fears,
Until thou come to wit and years;
Perhaps yet thou may come to be,
A course our by disdaining me:
Poor me, poor me, alas poor me,
My own two eyes hade blinded me,
Balow, balow, etc.
On Love and fortune I complain,
On them, and on my self also:
But most of all mine own two eyes
The chiefest workers of my woe.
For they have caused so my smart,
That I must die without a heart,
Balow, balow, etc.
Balow my babe, thy Fathers dead
To me the Prodigal has played:
Of heaven and earth regardless he
Presen'd the wars to me and thee,
I doubt that now his cursing mind
Make him eat accorns with the swine
Balow, balow, etc.
Farewell, farewell, most faithless youth
That ever kissed a woman's mouth,
Let never a woman after me,
Submit unto the courtesy.
For if she do, O cruel thou,
Would wrong them: O who can tell how,
Balow, balow, etc.
