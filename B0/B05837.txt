Shepherd's Ingenuity: OR, The Praise of the Green Gown,
To the Tune of, The Two Entire Lovers.
Licensed according to Order.







Amongst the pleasant shady Bowers,
as I was passing on,
I saw the springing Grass and Flowers,
was gently pressed down;
Then straight I thought unto myself,
whoever here has been,
I Am sure some gentle Shepherdess
has gotten a Gown of Green.
Long may that Shepherdess enjoy,
that pleasant Robe of Love,
And eke the Swain that gave it her,
that he may constant prove;
For all the Robes that Ladies wear,
which ever I have seen,
Not one of them can now compare,
to the sweet Gown of Green.
Some for to gain their Ladies Love,
will give them Chains and Rings,
Some gives them Fans and Fancies too,
but these ate foolish things;
If you would fain her Love obtain,
let this be your endeavor,
To give her a fair Gown of Green,
and then she is yours for ever.


When as my Celia fair and I,
did meet upon the Down,
Our study only was to try,
to fit her in a Gown:
She found the finest fashion then,
as ever yet was seen;
She did become it passing well,
'twas a fine Gown of Green.
The Gown which I gave her of late,
was almost out of hue,
Therefore I resolved straight,
to make another new;
The Stuff lay ready then to cut,
the Board was tight and clean,
So to the work my hands I put.
to shape this Gown of Green.
My Arms K clasped round my Love,
to take the measure true,
She fearing I would wanton prove,
then streightways backwards drew:
With her small Waste I closed fast,
as we two Twins had been,
She struggling caught a fall at last,
to shape this Gown of Green.
She asked me, is this the way
in shaping of a Gown?
Yes, if you would have it neat and gay,
'its done by lying down,
And take your measure handsomely,
to make it strait and even,
A lively posture of a Maid,
to shape a Gown of Green.
I raised her from the tender Grass,
to view her noble Dress,
She thought her self a handsome Lass,
in troth I thought no less;
Her Beauty in this Robe did shine,
more bright than Flora's Queen;
Now Lasses if you would be fine,
put on the Gown of Green.
Now all you little pretty Maids,
that covets to go brave,
Frequent the Meadows, Groves and Shade
where you those Garbs may have;
Wen Flora's Cover^d she spreads,
then Bridget, Kate and Jane,
May change their silly Maiden-heads,
for curious Gowns of Green.
