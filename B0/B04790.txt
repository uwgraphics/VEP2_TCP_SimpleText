A Potion for an Apothecary, Or, The Apothecaryes portion,

It may be termed a Net, a Snare, or Iin
That Is only set to catch young Wood-cocks in
Then let no silly bird here at be Ieering,
Forwhen it is Sung you will say it is worth the hearing.
To the tune of, Old flesh.


OF a gallant Apothecary
a story I will tell,
His carriage and behavior
and what of him befell:
He was no silly Coxcomb
nor he was no Country clown,
But he lived in famous London,
a place of high renown,
He was active in his practice,
and skillfull of his trade,
And some women did suppose him
to be a Bil-bow-blade,
He was witty in his speeches
and of qualities most rare,
Yet he like to a Wood-cock
was caught at unaware.
This brave young Pothecary
he lived void of strife,
He stood in need of nothing,
but he wanted a rich wife:
And for that only purpose
he many plots have laid
To marry with some rich Widow:
or some wealthy Country Maid,
His pate it was more subtle
then any crafty Fox
But in the last conclusion
he was her^^d like an Ox;
Now mark what followed after,
and you shall quickly hear.
How he like to a Wood-cock
was caught at vn-aware.
A Punck that lived in London
which had of wealth to store,
For all that she had got was
by playing of the Whore
She like a cunning Gypsy,
consulted with her Baud
This brave Apothecary
to cozen and defraud:
Like a brave young Gentlewoman
that was in the Country borne
In habit and attire
she did her self adorn
Her Baud like to a servant,
did wait as may appear,
And they caught the witty Wood-cock,
before he was aware.
And being so provided,
as true reports have said,
The Punck she was the Mistrisse,
and the Baud her waiting Maid,
They then took up their lodging
as it is known full well
Near to the very place where
this brave young spark did dwell,
The mistress feigned her self
to be sick with cold and Tissick
And sent to the Pothecary
cause he should give her Physic,
Who every day imployd her
with Pills, and such like gear,
But he like to a Wood-cock,
was caught at vn-aware.
The Apothecary often,
to the Gentlewoman came,
Who beholding of her favor,
saw she was a handsome dame,
His heart within his belly,
with love was set on fire
But he knew not how nor which way
to compass his desire:
And therefore in close secret,
to the Maid he told his mind,
Desiring of her favor
that she would be so kind
To speak a good word for him,
unto her Mistress dear,
And he would well reward her
as you shall after hear.
The Maid replied unto him,
there is no way to win her,
Unless you do invite her,
on Sunday next to dinner:
Whereby to make her merry,
and cast away all care
And feast her corpse with Iunkets
with Wine and with good Cheer
And when you all are frolic,
I will a question move
So that you thereby may know
whither she will hate or love:
These words of hers o'r joy'd him,
as it does well appear,
And at last the witty Wood-cock,
was caught in his own snare.
A dinner was provided
at the appointed day
And the Gentlewoman sent for
who came without delay,
In all her gay apparel
in such a stately manner
As if she were a Lady
with her Maid to wait upon her;
And being sat at dinner
in all her gallant bravery
The youngman nere mistrusted
of any point of knavery:
They eat, drank, and were merry
having plenty of good cheer
But that same Sundaies dinner
cost the Apothecary dear.
Whilst they were inmidst of pleasure
a man that was but poor,
Came on a hasty message,
and knocked at the door
He brought with him a Letter
forth of the Country
Which to the Gentlewoman
must needs delivered be
When as she had received it
the messenger she paid
And gave the Apothecary
the letter for to read
Which letter proved his baine
as you presently shall hear
And how this witty Wood-cock
was caught in his own snare.


The words that were written in the counterfeit Letter, as if they came from
her Brother out of the Country were as follows.
SWeet Sister I desire you
to be patient and content,
Though I this doleful Letter
and Messenger have sent
Whereby to give you notice
your Father's dead and gone,
And how he has bestowed
his Goods to every one
Of us that are his Children.
which does alive remain,
Note well what here is set down,
the case is very plain:
He has made me his Executor,
as you may understand,
And I am in possesion
of all my Fathers Land.
To my second Brother Henry
a Farm he did give.
Which is enough to maintain him
and his whilst he does live,
And to my Brother Edward,
as plainly may appear,
He gave him for continuance
two hundred pound a Year:
And you have for your Portion
of Silver and of Gold.
Fifteen hundred pound of Money
as good as e're was told:
Wherefore I pray good Sister
come home and take your own,
That ones part from another
amongst us may be known.
Your Loving Brother,


When as this Gentlewoman
had heard the Letter read.
How that her aged Father
was dead and buried,
She sighed and she sobbed,
she wept and made great moan
Her maid that waited on her
fetched many a heavy groan:
The Apothecary seeing such
floods of sorrows rise,
Like a kind hen-hearted coxcomb,
the tears fell from his eyes,
Now mark the last conclusion,
and you shall quickly hear,
How that this witty Wood-cock
was caught at un-aware.
When sorrows were past over,
and mirth did fresh revive,
They that were almost killed then
became to be alive,
The Apothecary having
a plodding cunning pate,
He thought for to be doing
before it was too late:
If he could wed the woman,
these were his antic fetches,
He was sure for to be Master
of all her Gold and Riches:
And therewithal he wood her,
without all wit or fear,
And so this witless Wood-cock
was caught in his own snare.
But to be brief in plain terms;
the matter so was carried,
That they agreed together,
and suddenly were married.
And for a little season
they lived free from strife,
For she likt well of her Husband
and he likt of his Wife:
But in a short time after
strange matters came to pass,
And a sudden alteration
betwixt this couple was,
He married her for lucre
of riches as you hear,
And so the simple Wood-cock
was caught in his own snare.
When they had lived together
three weeks or something more,
This Gallant did provide
in the Country for to go,
To see his wivs best friend there,
that was his chiefest motion,
And to receive the money which
was left her for her portion:
And for his solid Iourny
so well he did provide,
He bought new Boots and borrowed
a Horse whereon to ride,
A Sword and Horse-mans-Coat too
he borrowed as I hear,
And so into the Country he
rid without wit or fear.
And thinking that his Wife had,
bin honest, true, and just,
All that which was his own Goods
with her he left in trust,
so he coming to the place where
his brother in law should dwell,
Of such a manner of person there
was never a one could tell:
And as for the old man which
was said to be dead and gone,
In all the Parish over of
that name was never a one:
Wherefore he back returned
to London as I hear,
With a purse that held no money,
and a heart filled full of care.
But when he came to London
no Wife that he could find,
Which was a greater cross,
and a trouble to his mind,
For she was run away with
the Baud which she called her maid,
And with a Pimp of hers
which their heads together laid.
Wherefore the Apothecary
in rage most deeply swore,
That he was basely cozed by
an old Baud and a young Whore:
And now his fellow Neighbors
does at him scoff and jeere,
'Cause he like to a Woodcock
was caught at un-aware.
You Widowers and Batchelors
if single men you be,
Be warned by the Apothecary
and be ruled awhile by me.
Choose a Wife that is truly honest
though she be never so poor,
It Is better then a rich Wife, if
she love to play the Whore:
The Lord will give a blessing
to Truth and Honesty,
when thieves, whores, bauds and panders
may at Tyborn chance to dye.
Be heedfull in your choosing,
and have a special care,
Lest like to silly Wood-cocks you
be caught at un-aware.
