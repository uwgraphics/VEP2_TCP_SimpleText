A LETTER, From His Majesty the King of England, to the Meeting of the Estates
in Scotland.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
WE have had a full Account of your Procedure from my Lord Ross, with which We
are well satisfied, and thereby, and by your Letter sent with him, We have
evident proof of your great Affection to Us, and Confidence in us. We are still
of the same mind, which We did express in Our former Letter to you. We are not
Diffident, that by your Care and Prudence, the Great Interests of that Nation,
shall shortly be brought to a happy close; We have already Ordered Ships of
War, for a Guard to your Coasts, and have appointed the Regiments, which We
sent you, to be Recruited with a considerable addition; We have sent Regiments
of Horse to the North of England, that will be near you, and from whom you may
have Supplies, if you have necessity. And we shall be wanting in nothing in Our
Power, that may be for your Safety and Satisfaction. And so We bid you heartily
Farewell.

Given at Our Court at Hampton, the second day of April. And of Our Reign, the
first Year, 1689. WILLIAM R.

Edinburgh, Printed in the Year, 1689.
