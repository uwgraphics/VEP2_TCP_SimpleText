The Sea-mans leave taken of his sweetest Margery. AND Margery her singing
loath to depart,
Being very unwilling to leave her Sweetheart.

To the tune of. I Will go through the world with thee.




Man. SWeet Margery I am pressed to the Sea,
with Gold and Silver in my hand:
I come to take my leave of thee,
and bid adieu to fair England.

Maid. But will thou be gone my Honey sweet,
and must I lose thy company:
Me thinks for thee it is not meet,
to leave thy dearest Margery.

Man. Sweet Margery I Must needs be gone,
alas there is no remedy:
But be I in company, or alone,
I Will not forget my Margery.

Maid. I would thou could my voyage excuse,
for I am loath to part from thee:
When thy sweet presence I do lose.
I shall be a sorrowful Margery.

Man. I prithee be not grieved so,
but take my absence patiently;
For wheresoever I come or go;
my heart remains with Margery.

Maid. A bird in hand's worth two in the bush,
and when thou are once gone from me;
I doubt thou will not care a rush,
what will become of thy Margery.

Man. I prithee do not conjecture thus,
nor question my true Constancy;
The Gordian knot which tyeth us,
I Will never break from my Margery.

Maid. Well if I thought thou would prove true
and bear a faithful heart to me:
To sorrow I should bid adieu,
as thou take leave of thy Margery.

Man. Do not misdoubt my love at all,
nor vex thy head with jealousy:
What chance soever me befall,
I Will never forsake my Margery.

Maid. Excuse me if I judged wrong,
it is my tender love to thee;
Least when thou have been absent long,
thou might forget thy Margery.

Man. That can I never for my life,
for I am thine until I dye;
And if I ever marry a wife,
it shall be my sweet Margery.

Maid. I prithee do that before we part,
that joyful day I might but see;
'Twould put all sorrows from my heart,
and none so blithe as Margery.

The second Part.
To the same tune.


ICH ^ DIEN



Man. Be not s hasty, rather stay,
for at this time it cannot be;
I must abord this present day,
and leave my sweetest Margery.

Maid. Then take from me a parting kiss,
this Point about thine arm I Will tie;
And when thou look upon thy wrist,
then think upon thy Margery.

Man. This Point I will esteem more dear,
then all the Jewels I shall see;
Pluck up thy heart and be of good cheer,
till I return to my Margery.

Maid. When you do walk in the Spanish street
and many Gallants pass you by;
Your Chamber docks and music sweet,
then you will forget your Margery.

Man. I prithee harp not on that string,
these words do touch my heart full nigh
For I esteem no earthly thing,
so much as I do sweet Margery.

Maid. Sweet Lave forget that word Unkind,
'twas spoke thy Patience but to try;
For I am persuaded in my mind,
thou lov^st no Less but Margery.

Man. I have seven Ships upon the Sea,
and are all laden to the brim;
I am so inflamed with love to thee
I care not whether they sink or swim.

Maid. Hencdforth I Will never mistrust thee more,
nor question thy true loyalty;
Where ever thou art on Sea or Shore,
thou wilt think upon thy Margery.

Man. If any Knight or Gentleman,
do pass the Seas to my Country;
I Will write a Letter with my own hand,
and send it to my Margery.

Maid. O how shall I that Letter kiss,
so soon as ever I it spy;
It would present a world of bliss
unto thy loving Margery.

Man. Margery I Will a Gallant prove,
and for t^y sake my valsur try:
Though all my kin seek to remove
my thoughts from my sweet Margery.

Maid. If I had wist before I had kissed,
that Love had been so dear to win;
My heart I would have close'd in Gold,
and pinned it with a Silver pin.

Man. The time sweet Margery calls away,
I now must leave thy company;
For time and Tide for none will stay,
once more farewell sweet Margery.

Maid. Once more I Will kiss thy sugared Lips,
and take thy absence patiently;
Heaven prosper thee, and thy seven Ships,
and send thee safe to Margery.

FINIS.
