Garnet, the Popes chief wandering Priest, his habit and attire.


LEt all true English hearts now sing
Unto the Lord our heavenly King,
Which Treasons unto light does bring,
To the Authors endless shame.
N^ Treason was more vild and bad,
Which Popish crew conspired had,
To make all England mor^e and sad.
To Papists endless shame.
Nor former age was ever bent,
Such Treasons strange for to invent,
And turn them to so ill intent:
To Papists endless shame.
The Treasons all, God has bewraide,
Which Pope and Priests and Papists laid:
For God above is still our aid,
To Papists endless shame.
These thirty years no Traitors spite
Was wrought against the Gospels light,
Nor yet against our Sovereigns right,
To Papists endless shame.
But Steeuen Garnet (void of grace)
Knew when, and how, and where the place
That Treasons plotting were apace,
To Papists endless shame.
He travail did both far and near,
Like to a Woolfe and ravenous Bear,
To keep poor silly souls in fear,
To Papists endless shame.
He has seduced many a soul,
And in his Book did them inroule,
To make them pay the Devil toule,
To Papists endless shame.
For he to bring them in c^^riers,
Has sent part hence for to^^ Friars:
And traiterous seducing lies,
To Papists endless shame.
The Women Nu^es he ^ath ordayn'd,
Thinking thereby that be has gained:
Their souls in Hell for to be ^hain'd.
To Papists endless shame.
His Pardons and his Bulls are cros^,
His Popish dignity is lost:
His Relics eke, to his great cost,
And Papists endless shame.
His holy Bones, and holy Stocks,
His holy Shirtes, and holy Smockee^
Are come unto the Hang-mans box,
To Papists endless shame.
His (Holiness) pride is now pulled down,
Which Traitors loved in City and town
Derricke (the Hangman) has his gown
to Papists endless shame.
Now naught be auailes his holy Mass,
For time has brought it so to pass,
That he is prooud worse then an Ass,
To Papists endless shame.
His Abbots, Priors, Monks, and Friars,
And other his religious squiers,
Have prooud themselves all to be liers,
To Papists endless shame.
Their great Commander he is gone
Which Holiness seemde to put on:
But provide himself a traiterous on
