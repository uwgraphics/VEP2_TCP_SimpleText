THE Unfortunate Fencer; OR, The Courageous Farmer of Gloucester-shire.
SHOWING How this huffing Spark went down into those Parts, Challenging any one
at all sorts of Weapons; and at length shamefully Conquered by a Country Farmer.

To the Tune of, The Spinning Wheel.
Licensed according to Order.





YOu that delight in merriment,
be pleased to attend a while,
I hope to give you all content,
this very Song will make you smile;
It Is of a Fencer, brave and bold,
Adorned with rich embroidered Gold.
This Spark in pomp, and rich array,
from London rid with right good will,
That he young Lords might learn to play
all sorts of Weapons by his skill;
And wheresoe^er this Fencer came,
the drum, and trumpet, blazed his fame.
This huffing Fencer, fierce and stout,
to Gloucester City did repair,
And for a Sign he then hung out
a Sword of grand Defiance there;
The which a Farmer did espy,
As he by chance was passing by.
The jolly Farmer, brisk and bold,
as soon as he the Sword beheld,
He cried, what is there to be sold?
what is your Room with Rapiers filled?
The valiant Fencer did reply,
I come my Valor here to try.






With that he did his Rapier shake,
and said let whose will here arrive,
I do a noble Challenge make,
to fight the stoutest Man alive:
The Farmer said, I Will answer thee,
If that you dare to Cope with me.
The Fencer cried you sorry slave,
here by this Rapier in my hand,
I Will send thee to thy silent Grave,
against my force no Clown can stand:
It shall be tried the Farmer cried,
I value not your huffing Pride.
Next Morning they a Stage prepare,
the drums did beat, and trumpets sound,
Right joyful tidings to declare,
this Gallant traced the City round,
Dressed in his Shirt of Holland fine,
With Sword which did like Silver shine.
The Stage he mounted brisk and gay,
and eke the Farmer straight likewise;
To whom the Huffing Spark did say,
of you I Will make a Sacrifice,
This work in short, I shall complete,
You should have brought a Winding Sheet.
No more that, but let us fall too,
I hope to make my party good
And ever this World I bid adieu,
who knows but I may let you blood;
With that he cut him over the Face,
And thus began the Spark's Disgrace.
But when they came to Quarter-staff,
the Farmer banged the Spark about;
Which made all the Spectators laugh
and with Huzza's they all did shout;
He made his Head and Shoulders sore,
He never had been so thrash'd before.
Thus fairly did he win the day,
which put the Fencer in a Rage,
Who through the crowd did sneak away,
while the stout Farmer kept the Stage;
Huzza's of joy, did echo round,
While he with Victory was Crowned.
FINIS.
