AS I to Ireland did pass,
I saw a Ship at anchor lay,
Another Ship likewise there was
which from fair England took her way,
This Ship that sailed from fair England,
unknown unto our gracious King,
The Lord Chief Justice did command,
that they to London should her bring.
I draw more near and saw more plain,
Lady Arabella in distress,
She wrung her hands and wept amain,
bewailing of her heaviness.
When near fair London tower she came.
whereas her landing place should be,
The King and Queen with all their train
did meet this Lady gallantly:
How now Arabella, said our King,
unto this Lady straight did say,
Who has first tied ye to this thing,
that you from England took your way,
None but my self, my gracious lieg,
these ten long years I Have been in love.
With the lord Seymor's second son,
the Earl of Hartford so we prove.
Though he be not the mightiest Man
of goods and livings in the land,
Yet I have lands us maintain,
so much your grace does understand:
My lands and livings are well known
unto your books of Majesty,
Amounts to twelve score pound a week,
besides what I do give, quoth she.
In Gallant Darby-shire likewise,
I nine score beadsmen maintain there,
With Hats and Gowns, and House-rent free,
and every man five marks a year.
I never raised Rent, said she,
nor yet oppressed the Tennant poor,
I never took no bribes for fines,
for why, I had enough before.
Whom of your Nobles will do so,
for to maintain the Community?
Such multitudes would never grow,
nor be such store of Poverty.
I would I had a Milk-maid been,
or born of some more low Degree,
Then I might have loved where I like,
and no man could have hindered me.
Or would I were some yeoman's Child,
for to Receive my portion now,
According unto my Degree,
as other Virgins as I know.
The highest branch that soars aloft,
needs must beshade the Mirtle-tree,
Needs must the shadow of them both,
shadow the third in his degree.
But when the tree is cut and gone,
and from the ground is bore away,
The lowest tree that there does stand,
in time may grow as high as they.
Once when I thought to have been Queen,
but yet that still I do deny,
I knew your grace had right to the crown,
before Elizabeth did dye.
you of the eldest Sister came,
I of the second in degree,
The Earl of Hartford of the third,
a man of Royal blood was he.
And so goodnight, my Sovereign Liege,
since in the tower I must lie,
I hope your grace will condescend,
that I may have my liberty.
Lady Arabella, (said our King)
I to your freedom would consent,
If you would turn and go to Church,
there to receive the Sacrament.
And so good night, Arabella fair,
Our King replied to her again,
I will take counsel of my Nobility,
that you your freedom may obtain.
Once more to Prison must I go,
Lady Arabella then did say,
To leave my love breeds all my woe,
the which will be our lives decay,
Love is a knot none can unknit,
Fancy a liking of the heart,
Him whom I love I cannot forget,
though from his presence I must part.
the meanest people enjoy their Mates,
but I was born unhappily,
For being crossed by cruel fates,
I want both love and liberty.
But death I hope will end the strife,
farewell farewell my love (quoth she)
Once I had thought to have been thy wife,
but now am forced to part with thee.
At this sad Meeting she had cause,
in heart and mind to grieve full sore,
after that time Arabella fair,
did never see lord Seymor more.
