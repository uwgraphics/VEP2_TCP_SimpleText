ON THE THUNDER, Happening after the SOLEMNITY OF THE CORONATION OF CHARLES the
II. On St. GEORGE'S Day. 1661.
Exhilarant ipsos gaudia nostra Deos. Mart.
HEavens! we thank you, that you Thundered so!
As We did here, you Cannonado'd too.
A brave Report! as if you would outvie
Volleys, discharged by Charles His Cavalrie.
'Twas still in Clouds and Tempests your voice came!
For less than That could not have spoke His Name.
Thus mighty Jove, Co- partner in Our Joy,
Out- sounded, what we cried, Vive le Roy!
A sacred kind of Rival-ship! for here,
We gladly Feign, what They are Doing there.
It Is a bold Challenge (but I Will make it good)
Whether our Flames were lesser than their Flood?
As if St. George's Bon-fires would have done
More, than They could, by Inundation.
Avaunt Philosophy! we plainly prove,
The World must burn, but -- It Is with Charles his love.
Well! let us think upon it! who ere did view
The Sun in's Glory, but 'twas cloudy too?
Great Lights Eclipse the Less: Nor were you made
To shine so clear, as not to admit a shade.
You are Our Light, Our Comfort, and Our Hope;
Every good Subject is, your Heliotrope.
Two Suns, at once, within our Horizon!
Whilst we dispute, which was the fairer One!
A Pretty Emulation! Both did strive
Who should receive most beams, who most should Give:
'Till the upper-Lamp shrunk in his useless Ray,
And left, the Conquering Charles, to rule the Day.
'Twas his Discretion, for had Both shone Bright,
Heat had surpassed the Comfort of the Light;
Then did he weep for joy, -- A lovely weather!
It Rained as Heaven and Earth would come together:
And yet -- these April-tears, would have us know,
They grieved above, at Malcontents below.
To see, that Heaven, should design a Court
For Us, like Their's, and some -- not Thank them for it.
Hen. Bold,
olim e N. C. Oxon,
