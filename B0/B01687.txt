The Boatswains Call; OR, The Courageous Mariners Invitation to all his
Brother Sailers, to forsake Friends and Relations, for to fight in the defense
of their King and Country.
To the Tune of, King of Gold.
Licencsed according to Order.





STout Seamen come away,
never be daunted;
For if at home you stay,
then is it granted
The Fleet can never be
Manned for the Ocean,
To Fight the Enemy,
and gain Promotion.
Lewis that Christian- TURK,
makes preparation;
His Engines are at work
in Consultation,
Thinking to Ruin quite
all Christian Princes;
But we their wrongs will right,
at Life's expenses.
The Mighty force of France,
we never value
For when we once advance,
we will not dally:
But on the Ocean wide,
(through blessed permission)
We'll soon subdue their Pride,
and grand Ambition.
Therefore with Courage bold,
Boys, lets us venture,
Like noble hearts of Gold,
now freely enter
Your names on Board the Fleet,
all Friends forsaking,
That we may soon Conpleat
this undertaking.
Is it not that the Land,
might be defended.
By a Victorious hand,
though France intended
To lay a heavy Yoke,
on a free Nation;
Boys let a fatal stroke,
prove their vexation.
But yet my thinks I hear
some Cowards crying,
The Press they dread and fear,
as much as dying:
And sculk like frighted Slaves,
here in distraction,
To hide in Dens and Caves,
from Warlike Action.
Yet some declare they would fight,
but a dear Mother,
Who counts him her delight,
above all other;
She loves him as her Life,
parting would grieve her,
Another has a Wife,
he is loath to leave her.
Thus Cowards they can find
excuses many,
To tarry here behind,
yet there is not any
Right Valliant Noble Soul
heeds a Relation.
He Will fight against Control
for this his Nation.
Has not Men wished and cried,
a war with France, Boys,
That on the Ocean wide
we may advance, Boys,
To storm and shake their throne,
no danger fearing;
This has been still their Tone,
often in my hearing.
Where are those Heroes now
those sons of thunder.
That would make Lewis bow,
and bring him under?
Your wishes now you have,
France is the Center,
Like Seamen stout and brave,
Boys, freely venture.
In a fight fierce and hot,
once was I wounded;
We received showrs of shot
being surrounded;
Yet I again will go,
and scorn to hide me,
I Will face the daring foe,
what ever betide me.
He that has been in fight,
fears not another,
He leaves with much delight
Father and Mother,
To embrace those true Ioys,
which men admire,
We can be merry Boys,
in Smoke and Fire.
If we the Conquest gain,
that brings promotion,
If we by chance are slain,
then the wide Ocean,
Shall be our watery Tomb
near Neptunes Palace,
This Boys, shall be our Doom
in spite of Malice.
