To his Grace, His Majesty's high Commissioner, and the Right Honorable the
Estates of Parliament. The PETITION of The Hospital of the Merchants, and
Trades of Glasgow as Assigney, made by John Craig Merchant there.
Humyly shows,
THat the Magistrates of Irwing having in the Month of January 1688, borrowed
from the said John Craig, the Sum of 3000 Merk^, they with their Town Council
gave Bond for the same; but the succeeding Magistrates in the year 1690, having
given in a Petition to the Parliament, Representing, That the Magistrates who
granted the said Bond* were imposed upon the Town by the late King James,
contrair to Law; And therefore craving that the Town might be freed of this
Debt, and the Granters of the Bond and their private Fortunes declared to be
only therefore liable: The Petition was remitted to the Committee of Fines and
Forefaulters, who having appointed these former Magistrates to be cited, the
succeeding Magistrates did also procure a Warrant for citing the said John Craig
tho no ways concerned in the Controversy that was betwixt them, nor did they
indeed insist before the Committee against John Craig, but only against the
former Magistrates; But when the said John Craig came thereafter to charge the
succeeding Magistrates for the payment of his Money, they suspended upon this
Reason, that John the Charger had been cited before the said Committee, and
that the Matter was Lis pendens before the Parliament, upon which the Lords of
Session cemurred, and left the Determination of the matter to this High Court
of Parliament, where it still depends; But the said John Craig having now
assigned the foresaid Bond to the Hospitals of Glasgow: It is humbly
reprepresented in behalf of the said Hospitals, that John Craig lent his Money
bona fide, to the Town of Irwing, upon the Faith and Bond of the Magistrates and
Council, who were in the Government of the Burgh for the time; he neither did
know, nor was obliged to notice any thing of the illegal Imposing of these
Magistrates and Council upon the Burgh, nor was he concerned what way they
employed the Money, whether for the Towns use or not, it being sufficient for
all persons that lend Money to Burghs, that the Magistrates who for the time
represent the Burgh give Bond for the same, by warrant of their Town-Council;
And it is well known, that Magistrates were imposed by the late King James upon
many others Burghs, and yet the Debts contracted, and other Deeds done by them,
as representing the Burgh, were never on this account questioned; and it were
indeed a strange Paradox, if either the illegal imposing, or undue Election of
Magistrates should make either their Bonds or Deeds, while in peaceable
possession of the Office, null and void, but on the contrary, these Debts and
Bonds do certainly oblige the Burgh, and although the Magistrates the Granters
thereof should be turned out, yet the Burgh is still unquestionably bound, or
otherways the Credit, and even the Government of all the Burghs of Scotland
should be rendered doubtful and ruined: But seeing that the Lords of Session have
demurred to proceed in the said matter, and that upon a Petition given in by
the said John Craig the last Session of Parliament; Craving, that he might be
remitted to the Lords of Session, to discuss the foresaid Suspension. The
Parliament did by their last Deliverance upon the 4th of May 1693. ordain the
Cause to be discust the 12th. day of the same Month, which yet by reason of
other Business was never since called, and that your Grace and Lordships cannot
but be convinced, that it is a hard case, that a private Bond or Debt of this
kind should be so long delayed and put off, upon the foresaid Contest betwixt
the former and succeeding Magistrates, wherein neither John Craig nor the
Hospitals his Assigney are at all concerned.

May it therefore please your Grace, and the Honorable Estates of Parliament,
either to call and determine the said Action, or otherwise to remit to the
Lords of Session, to discuss the foresaid Suspension, not withstanding of any
Citation given to the said John Craig to appear before the Parliament or
Committee, and without regard to the Controversy betwixt the succeeding and
former Magistrates about the Towns Relief, wherein your Petitioners are no ways
concerned; and this the Parliament are humbly entreated to do, both because of
the concern of the poor Hospitals, and that the Case is plainly depending by
the said last Minut lying in Process, and that the Town of Irving is
represented by their Commissioner present.

And your Grace and Lordships Petitioners shall ever pray.
