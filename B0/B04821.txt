The Merry Man's Resolution OR, His last farewell to his former acquaintance,
Declaring how he rambled up and down,
Through all the Suburbs of fair London Town,
Where pretty wenches he did plenty find,
But some of them agreed not with his mind,
Till at the last by chance he found out one,
Which pleased him best, so left the rest alone,
To her he then cling'd close as I heard tell,
Made her his mate and bid the rest farewell.
To a gallant new Tune, called the Highlanders new Rant.




NOw farewell to Saint Gileses
that stands in the fields
And farewell to Turnbull-street
for that no comfort yields,
Farewell unto the Greyhound,
and farewell the Bell,
And farewell my land-lady,
whom I do love so well
With a come Love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee.
Farewell to Long Acre,
that stands near to the Mews
And farewell unto Drury Lane
where pretty wenches use,
And farewell unto Sodom
and all her painted Drabs,
And farewell unto Bloomsbury
and all their vapouring scabs
And come love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee,
Farewell to Crose-lane.
it here lives some babes of graces
Farewell to Common-garden,
and all her wanton places,
Farewell unto West-minster
and farewell to the Strand
Where I had choice of mopseis even
at my own command,
Sing come Love,
Stay Love,
go a long with me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee.
Farewell to the Bank side
farewell to Black-mans street,
Where with my bouncing lasses,
I oftentimes did meet,
Farewell to Kentstreet Garrison,
farewell to Horsey-down,
And all the smirking Wenches,
that dwells in Redrif Town,
And come Love,
Stay Love,
go a long with me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee.
The second part
to the same tune.




NOw farewell unto Wapping
and farewell to Blackwall,
Farewell to Ratclife highway,
Rosemary lane and all,
And farewell unto Shore-ditch,
and More-fields eke also,
Where mobs to pick up cullies,
A night walking do go,
Then come Love,
Stay Love,
go along with me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee.
In White-crose street and Goldenlane
do straping lasses dwell,
And so there do in every street
twixt that and Clarken well,
At Cowcrose and Smithfield,
I have much pleasure found,
Where wenches like to Fayeries,
did often trace the round,
Yet come Love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all those girls i will forsake for thee.
Yet something more i will speak off
which seems to many strange.
There Is store of pretty wenches,
lives near to the Exchange;
And many more there are sure,
that dwells in Cheapside,
And other streets in London,
which are both broad and wide,
Yet come Love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all those girls i will forsake for thee.
To all the Country mopseis
where ever they do dwell,
In this my last conclusion,
I like wise bid farewell,
Though they were used in former time
to come when I did call,
I take thee for the boldest,
and best among them all,
Then come Love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee.
At Bristoll and at Gloucester
I had of Loves great store:
But now I find enough of thee,
I will desire no more.
And what I have said to thee
thou shall find true and right:
He do thee trusty service
at morning and at night
Then come Love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all the world i will forsake for thee.
Farewell black patches,
and farewell powdered locks,
And farewell Luthners Ladies
for they have got the pox,
Farewell the Cherry-garden,
forevermore adue
And farewell to Spur-Alley,
and all that wanton crew,
And come Love,
Stay Love,
go not from me,
For all those girls I Will forsake for thee.
I. P.
