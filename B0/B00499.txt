John and Joan: OR, A mad couple well met.
To the tune of the Paratour.


YOu nine Castalian Sisters
that keep Parnassus hill,
Come down to me,
and let me be
inspired with your skill,
That well I may demonstrate,
a piece of household stuff,
you that are wed
mark what is sedd,
Beware of taking snuff.
A mad fantastic couple,
a young man and a Less,
with their content
and friends consent
resolved their times to pass
As man and wife together,
and so they married were,
of this mad match
I made this Catch,
which you that please may hear.
They both had imperfections,
which might have caused strife
the man would swear,
and domineere,
so also would his wife.
If John went to one Alehouse,
Joan ran unto the next,
betwixt them both
they made an oath,
That neither would be next.
What ever did the good man
his wife would do the like,
if he was pleased
she was appeased,
if he would kick, she would strike.
If queen or slut he called her,
she called him rogue and knave,
if he would fight,
she would scratch and bite,
He could no victory have.
If John his dog had beaten,
then Joan would beat her cat,
If John in scorn
his band would burn,
Joan would have burnt her hat.
If John would break a Pipkin,
then Joan would break a pot,
thus he and she
did both agree
To waste all that they got.
If John would eat no victuals,
then Joan would be as cross,
they would not eat
but saved their meat,
In that there was no loss.
If John were bent to feasting.
then Joan was of his mind,
in right or wrong
both sung one song,
As Fortune them assignd.
The second part
To the same tune.


IN Tavern or in Alehouse,
if John and Joan did meet,
who ere was by
in company,
might taste their humors sweet:
What ever John had called for,
Joan would not be out-dar'd,
those that lacked drink
through want of chink
For them the better fared.
Thus would they both sit drinking,
as long as coin did last,
nay more then this,
ere they would miss
good liquor for their taste,
Io^n would have damm'd his doublet,
his cloak or any thing,
and Joan would pawn
her coife of Lawne,
Her bodkin or her ring.
If John were drunk, and reeled,
then Joan would fall in the fire,
if John fell down
in the midst o'th town,
be wraid in dirt and mire,
Joan like a kind co-partner,
scorned to stand on her feet,
but down she would fall
before them all,
And role about the street.
If John had called his Host knave,
Joan called her Hostis whore,
for such like crimes
they oftentimes
were both thrust out of door.
If John abused the Constable,
Joan would have beat the Watch
thus man and wife,
in peace or strife,
Each other sought to match.
But mark now how it chanced.
after a year or more,
this couple mad
all wasted had,
and were grown very poor,
John could no more get liquor,
nor Joan could purchase drink,
then both the man
and wife began
Upon their states to think.
Thus beat with their own wepons,
John thus to Joan did say,
Sweet heart I see
we two agree
the clean contrary way,
Henceforth let us do in goodness.
as we have done in ill,
I Will do my best,
do thou the rest:
A match quoth Joan, I will.
So leaving those mad humors
which them before possessed,
both man and wife
do lead a life
in plenty, peace, and rest:
Now John and Joan both jointly,
do set hands to the Plough.
Let all do so
in weal or woe,
And they will do well enough.
M.P.

Finis.
