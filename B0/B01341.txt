Of the Eclipses of the Luminaries, which will happen in this year, 1691.
IN this Year of God 1691, there will happen two Eclipses of the Sun, but none
of the Moon will fall in any part of this our Earthly Glob, in all this Solar
Revolution.

The first Eclipse of the Sun will happen on February the eighteenth, about our
five aclock in the morning, but in respect it will be invisible to us,
therefore I forbear to mention any further of it.

The second Eclipse of the Sun will be on Thursday the thirteenth day of
August, near six of the clock at night: it is celebrated in one degree of
Virgo, and Will be a great Eclipse, if the Air be serene, three fourths of the
Sun's Body will be obscured. The envyous Planet Saturn rules the Horoscope, and
will be in the ninth Angle, in platick Opposition of Jupiter: Mercury governs
the Eclipse, and Mars from Gemini, (in Conjunction of the Bulls Eye) casts an
angry Quadrate both at the Eclipsed Sun and him. Verbum sat.

On the 25th day of July this Year, is Celebrated a famous Opposition of Saturn
and Mars; one of them is with the Pleiades and the other in Opposition unto
that turbulent Constellation. The effects whereof will not only be seen in the
Air, but in the Actions and Passions of humane kind: I mean that part of them
that are subject to those two Signs wherein the Opposition is made, viz. Taurus
and Scorpio.

the North-side of the Street, over against the Mercat Cross; or at his own
Dwelling House at the Ioch-end of Restalrig.

An Ancient Dutch Prediction, for the Year 1691.
FOur Figurs upside down, read as ye will,
Mak's Year the same, and equal number still.
In that same Year, great Turnings shall be made,
Lilly's that Year e're August first shall fade.
The fragrant Rule, shall blossom sweetly fair,
Thistle shall prick each hand that touch it dare:
Yet these three joined, shall pleasant Nose-gay be,
The Harp right tuned make better Melody.
A Crew of Brethren, come of Flesh and Blood,
Yet wanting both, brought up on Land and Flood;
This Year shall in all Courts and Councils creep,
Disclose their Secrets, yet their Secrets keep:
Condemn, Absolve, raise strife, and compose jars,
In peace teach meekness, but in time of Wars,
Shall rush as swift as shaft from Turkish-bow,
Shall wound the Horse, and lay the Ryder low:
Though fierce in Fight, to make the stoutest quake,
They shall be ready still good Truce to make:
To just great Differences, end Debates,
Secure all Ranks in Properties, Estates.
