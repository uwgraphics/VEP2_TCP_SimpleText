THE DUTCH BRIBE, A Ballad.
I.
YOUR Cheese we have eat, and a Toast with it drank,
That you never might vote, nor eke ever frank,
And that you might hang, spite of all you have in Bank,
Upon Tyburn Tree.
II.
IOWN you was once honest John called indeed,
But now you're Excise-John, in HONEST JOHN's stead,
And at last you will be John, that is excis'd by the Head
Upon Tyburn Tree.
III.
HAD you not been a Blockhead, could you ever think,
To bribe Folks with Cheese, and not a Drop drink;
Depend on it we'll see you yet hang till you stink
Upon Tyburn Tree.
IV.
SINCE Honor and Honesty you have forsaken,
May your ill gotten Wealth be all from you taken,
And your fat Carcass hang, until it grow Bacon,
Upon Tyburn Tree.
V.
WOWE Cooper of Fife! but your Carry to please,
Like Rats or like Mice, to be caught with his Cheese;
Your Member, I hope, he will soon get a Heze
Upon Tyburn Tree.
VI.
DESSERTS now at Cooper must surely be rare,
If for Cheese without Apples you vote for Mynheer;
But had he his Deserts, he would soon swing in the Air
Upon Tyburn Tree.
VII.
PRAY remember my Text and the Words of my Sermon,
And let not this Blunderbuss catch you like Vermin,
Which if you should do, may you all soon be swarming
Upon Tyburn Tree.
VIII.
SURE a stupider Fellow never opened a Mouth,
To think with his Cheese he could cure Cooper Drouth;
Jack-Catch do your Duty, so tuck up the Youth
Upon Tyburn Tree.
