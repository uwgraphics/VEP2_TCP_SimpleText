To each Gentleman Soldier in the Company of Captain William Hulls; Captain in
the Yellow Regiment of Trained Bands of LONDON.
AMongst the Brave, the Gallant, and the Bold,
Those worthy Names in Honors List enrolled,
You, Gentlemen, that Rightful Challenge claim,
To Lead, and March in the First Front of Fame.
In The Art of Arms, you bear a fair applause:
And wear those Souls as Glorious as your Cause.
The YELLOW then! (whose Fame and high Renown,
Justly acquired, does sound through all the Town!)
With the whole Field may Honorably vye;
What Sons of Mars can bear their Heads more high!
Permit me then, where Worths so much deserve,
(Proud of the Noble Captain that I serve)
My Duty and my Gratitude to express;
So great your Merit, and my Zeal no less;
But whilst your Marshal does attempt to raise
His Humble Muse to your exalted Praise,
These worthless Tributary Lines I bring,
Are so beneath the Subject that I sing,
That it is a Work I faintly must fulfill,
So much your Pen of Steel's above my Quill.
With such True Hearts then to support the Crown,
Great WILLIAM and Fair MARY's high Renown,
May they to all those heights of Glory rise,
As shall at once France, Rome, and Hell despise:
Tread on the Necks of all their Treacherous Foes,
He Britains LION, She the British ROSE.
Your Trusty Marshal, Richard Leech.
