A godly Ballad declaring by the Scriptures the plagues that have insued
whordome.
REfrain of youth thy. vain desire.
subdue thy lusts inordinate:
Suppress ye sparks lest if the fire,
to quench them it will be to late.
Thou knowste not what a poiso^ strong
thou let breed within thy breast,
Which if thou keep within thee long,
will cause thee care and much unrest.
Though it seem sweet in thy conceit,
beware thou never nurish it:
The Fish is by a pleasant bait,
constrained to the deadly bit.
Like as the woorm in Afric bred.
whose sting destroith with venem cold:
Is not so noisome to be fled,
as lust that reigns vncontrolde.
If reason caunot rule thy will.
but vice will reign through appetite:
Then let thy harms that happen still,
(through lusts) refrain thy fond delight.
Remember eke that in Noes days,
when vice through lust was rifly grown:
The whole world by such wicked ways,
by rage of Rain was overthrown.
The King of Egypt Pharao,
was be not plagued of God most just:
Both he and all his house also,
only for he gave place to lust.
So read we of Abimelech,
the mighty King of Gerera:
That God gave him a grenous check,
for lusting after Saraa.
Lust did destroy the Sodomites,
as is in Scripture manifest:
For lust were slain the Sichamites,
when Sichem Dina had oppressed.
Lust did the wits somuche inchaunt.
of Putipher the gipcians wife:
That Joseph for be would not grant,
her suit she brought nigh from his life.
Bethsaba naked in bath,
bewitched so King David's brain:
That giltles he procured has,
her husband Vry to be slain.
The cheef among the Israelites,
for noughty lust and eke offense:
Wrought by the means of Moabites,
were hanged up by Gods sentence.
For lust Zimry the Israelite,
as witnesses Gods holy word:
And Cosby eke the Madianite,
perished both through Zimphas sword,
The Israelites through fleshly lust.
toward their enmies daughters were:
Alluerd by them false Gods to trust,
which all their thraldomes caused clear.
Sampson the son of Monoa,
that mighty Judge in Israel:
For lust he had to Dalila,
him self to kill greef did compel.
Lo, him that none could foil in fight,
whose puissant arm the Lion show:
Whose strength put thousands unto flight,
by lust one woman overthrew.
Lust in the tribe of Benjamin,
cast twenty thousand down and five:
So that in all for that one sin,
were but six hundred left on live.
If Ammons lust had not defilde,
his sister Thamar with incest:
He had not of his life been spoild,
at Absolon his brothers feast.
If lust had not impaird the name,
of Solomon that witty King:
He had not lost his royal fame,
nor fallen to Idols worshipping.
If Herod in his sinful life,
had not by lust been sore misled:
He had not kept his brothers wife.
nor stricken of John Baptists head.
Now what be these but tokens sure,
That God will plage all those that use:
To lead their lives in lust vnpure,
and with out fear them selves abuse*
But some do think God does not see,
to each man's doing in all things,
Because some seem full safe to be,
and prosper still in il livings.
But if such will give ear unto,
Gods word which does the truth us tell:
Shall soon perceive those that live so,
shall sudenly go down to hell.
Therefore to God now let us pray*
that he will gide our hearts a right:
To flee from filthy lusts always,
and him to please with all out might.
And also for our gracious Queen,
that God long prosper her and then:
Good days among us may be seen,
which unto us he grant, Amen.
A. I.
