The Dutch-men's Reasons
^a Dutch Sunday to be observed once a Month, etc. ^ith their last Pra^er, and
final Resolution (if it prove ineffectual) ^ainst the Excessive Power of FRANCE.

To the Tune of the City Gulls.
^L Dutch and English that are left
^live within this Land,
(...) their Senses not-bereft,
(...) now understand
^easons why we have thought fit
(...) proclaim a Fast;
(...) is, that Heaven would us permit
^at the French at last.
^^^e our Arms their Aim have mist
(...) three Campaigns in Flanders,
(...) makes us fear Heaven does assist
(...) French King's brave Commanders:
^uxenburgh, as if inspired,
^ct with that Decorum,
(...) when our Troops against his Fired
love all strait before him.
^hen they came with Sword in hand
(...) other to attack,
French as firm as Rocks did stand,
(...) made us all give back:
^an't they brag nor boast too much
(...) entire Defeat;
(...) though no English, yet the Dutch
^ake a brave Retreat.
(...) who is able to withstand
(...) Excessive Power of FRANCE,
(...) Aesop does lead on the Van,
(...) his Conquering Troops advance?
(...) on him, he is a Witch we fear,
(...) so Brave and Stout;
^et him Charge in Front, or Rear,
(...) does our Armies Rout.
(...) it is madness we confess
(...) with France to Fight;
(...) let our Force be more or less
^e Cause been't Just and Right.
(...) English Men, when they engage,
^y scorn to Flinch, or Waver;
^y only wish for a clear Stage,
(...) from the Foe no Favor.
Witness at Steenkirk where they stood
'Till Thousands lost their Lives,
And spent their Blood for the public Good,
And to preserve our Wives
And Children all, from being Slaves
To France, and made a Prey;
They Would rather like Fools dig their Graves,
Then like us run away.
But what if Mounsieur's Maggot bite,
And he should take a freak,
To put us all into a fright
By besieging of Mast^eick.
There Is but one way that can be good
To obstruct his marching thither,
To pray with all our hearts Heaven would
Send some Confederate Weather.
But those Designs of Hell, and France,
Great William will prevent
With English Troops, which he will advance,
And make a great Descent:
In Person he has Vowed to go,
Therefore we need not fear,
The Descent will miscarry so,
As it did the last Year.
Since England has Five Millions raised
In order to Recrute
Our Troops this Year, kind Heaven be praised,
We will once more Dispute;
Whether William, Lewis, or King James,
Their Right can best maintain:
For if we don't the Man it seems
Will have his Mare again.
And having quite repaired our Loss
We'll Fast and Pray once more;
But should the Fates prove half so cross
As at Mons and Namure,
We do protest we'll never Fast,
Nor Pray; but for the future
We'll only beg that Heaven at last
Would act fair, and stand neuter.
Printed at AMSTERDAM in the Year 1693.
