A ballad entitled, Prepare ye to the Plowe,
To the Tune, of Pepper is black.
The Queen holds the Plow, to continue good seed.
Trusty Subjects be ready to help if she need.
Look up my Lords, and mark my words,
and hear what I shall sing ye:
And Subjects all, both great and small,
Now mark what word I bring ye.
Parnaso Hill, nor all the skill,
Of Nimphs or Muses feigned:
Can bring about that I find out,
By Christ hin self ordained.
Let wisdom be, as it is I see,
A gift most worth the telling:
Which never was, so brought to pass,
Where Pagans have been dwelling.
Is now in fine, by power divine,
Among us English planted:
Which many a day, was kept away,
And many a one it wanted.
And by that wisdom, have we had,
Such proof as yet was never:
To Judge and deem, both good and bad
To our great comfort ever.
Which sithes we have, now let us hold
This Tutchstone is the trial:
To beat the baggage from the Gold,
and truth from false denial.
And by this knowledge we do know,
That every thing is vain:
Beneath the Son, which hear below,
We covet to attain.
Let not the spright, give us delight,
To labor and attend us:
To seek to have, before our Grave,
The joy that Christ may send us.
In seking that, then must we not,
Build on the Sandy Surges:
Now sow our Seed, where every Weed,
His grace and bounty vrges.
Nor put our hope, in Preeste or Pope,
In Mass or other matters:
Or by our Dole, to save our Soul,
With filling empty Platters.
Or by a Pardon, to appease,
The Surfits of our sinning:
Although our fathers, had all thease,
By wicked men's beginning
Nor let us make our stock and store,
A burden to accuse us:
For doing so, so much the more,
We tempt God to refuse us.
Neither let us once presume so far,
Of mercy or of meekenes:
To counterfeit, to make or mar,
This Image or this likeness.
That our forefathers did believe,
Were Gods, to give and guide them:
Such follies did the Christians grieve,
and Pagans now deride them.
Remember once the latter law
Left yet in Moses Table:
That Neighbourly to live in awe,
It is most commendable.
Then should thou not desire to crave,
Thy Neigbours loss or lack:
Neither excess desire to have,
That puts thy soul to wrack.
Neither Vsery, nor use at all,
Of women, wealth, or Wine:
Neither of abundance, great or small,
Ill gotten should be thine.
Neither should contencion, craft increase,
Nor swearing bear the sway:
Nor God unserved men as beasts
Would break the Sabbath day.
Then would the honor duly hit,
To Parents Lord or King:
Then would there be no doubt a whit,
To have store of every thing.
All this the new Law, with the old
Does Nip us to remember:
Even as the frost, that waxes cold,
Does Nip us in December.
And as upon, a sudden heat,
We soon forget that freesing:
When God does of his mercy great,
Spare us for lack of leesing.
So let us think, as Summer shows
Grene Grass to our deliting:
We se that all the Grass that grows,
Goth down with little smiting.
And when the Mowyer coms to Mow,
It Is sone both Ripe and Rotten:
This tale I trust, of hye and low,
Will never be forgotten.
On Gods good Book, then let us look,
For that which never fails:
Without which book, by Hook, or crook,
No worldly wit prevails.
God save her grace that holds the Plow,
To sow this trusty treasure:
Though many a one be stubborn now,
And Harrow it but at leisure.
God grant that he that Harrowed Hell,
In guardon still may have her:
And send you grace, that think not well,
Of God that so does save her.
VV. Elderton.
