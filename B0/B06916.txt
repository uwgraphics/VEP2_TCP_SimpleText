If thy estate be took from thee
And thou art brought to poverty
By crosses or afflictions strong
Murmr nor grieve at any wrong
It Is God that has a hand over all
To raise thee up, or let thee fall
Perhaps the Lord would try to find
If thou had Jobs contented mind.
If honors or preferments great
Shall raise thee up on Justice seat
Or that by place or dignity
A Judge of Causes thou must be
Think that Heavens Court of Justice high
Over all your actions casts an eye
That mighty Judge be sure can find
The secrets of your heart and mind.
If that Gods Laws thou break (...)
Or by oppression wrong the poor
Or if of men thou stands in fear
To do what they will have thee here
Or let the mighty bear the sway
And turn the poor man's cause away
He that does this be sure will find
A troubled discontented ^i^d.
The second Part
to the same Tune.




IF otherwise thou seems to be
A Judge of right and equity,
And will the poor man's cause defend
As well as his that has means to spend,
And rig^^ the wro^gs of fatherless:
Like^^^ the wid^w in distress
A reward in Heaven thou then shall find
And on earth a sweet contented mind.
If thou art rich, thou poor may be;
If thou art poor, wealth may thou see;
If thou to honor rise or fall,
Be sure thou be content with all;
This world is subject still to change,
Then let not thine affections range,
Nothing on earth be sure thou wilt find
Compared to a contented mind.
If God has sent thee children store;
And yet perhaps thou art but poor;
Despair not, but contented be,
He will provide for them and thee;
To every mouth he bread will send,
(...) ^ill will stand the poor man's friend,
Relief from him thou sure shall find,
If thou have a contented mind.
What if this world does frown on thee,
For thy faith and fidelity,
Or that thou be in prison cast,
The Lord may bring thee out at last;
If not thou had better there to dye
Than from the true Religion fly:
Keep but thy faith, and thou shall find
In prison a sweet contented mind.
If that thy conscience tells to thee
Thy cause is just, be ruled by me,
Let not the threats of mighty men
Take thy good conscience from thee then
^^ey of thy body shall have power,
^^ure thy soul they cannot devour
^n a quiet conscience thou shall find
^ontinual feasts to feed thy mind.
If that thou think a God there be,
That rules the Heaven and Earth we see,
Then think he has a hand over all,
To raise men up, or let them fall:
All Rulers great, by Sea and Land
Must stoop, if once he gives command
He must protect you, else you will find
A sad and discontented mind.
Content is a Jewel, and a Feast,
Content is a rich and welcome Guest,
Content is of such high renown,
It Is better than an earthly Crown,
Content is such a precious store
That he that has it needs no more:
If you can gain it, you shall find
No joys like a contented mind.
(...) content ^ou needs will gain
I Will tell you where it does remain
Inquire where Conscience keeps
And where plain dealing does re^
Then truth will lead you by the ha^
And bring you where Content does (...)
Embrace him then and you shall find
No wealth like a contented mind.
