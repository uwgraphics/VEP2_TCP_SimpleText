thing that is in heaven above, or that is in ye earth beneath, or that is in
the water under the earth; thou shall not bow down thy self to them, nor serve

hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
Commandments.

an thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabath of thy Lord thy God, in it thou
shall not do any work thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy
manservant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle nor thy stranger, that
within thy gates: for in six day the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, and hallowed it.
