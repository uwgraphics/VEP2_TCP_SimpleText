A CONGRATULATION For His Sacred Majesty, CHARLES, the third Monarch of Great
Britain, His happy Arrival at WHITE HALL.
By a Loyal Member of His Majesty's Army.
Edinburgh, June 13. 1660.
BE gone dark shadows of a gloomy night:
Pack hence you furious Bugbears which affright
Weak humane fancies; banish sullen fears,
State-Tempests now are still, fair Calms appears:
Heavens are serene, Faces and Hearts rejoice;
Weigh Anchor Mariners, your Sails up-hoise,
And steer your Royal Vessel to that Port,
Where Loyal Hearts in Myriads shall resort;
Where every Knee shall bow, each Tongue shall cry
Blessed Encomiums to His MAjESTY.
BREDAH adieu, our DOVER longs to see
That Face, where is mounted Sovereign Majesty;
That Heart where Love enthroned sits and lives,
And greatest Injuries forgets, forgives;
That Magazine of Humane Policy,
Pattern of Patience, Prudence, Piety:
Once the Contempt, but now the Worlds great Wonder;
A King of Peace, and yet a King of Thunder:
A Son of Suffering, but now Triumphing,
By Patience learned the Art of Overcoming:
Over rigid Frowns, and feigned Smiles from those,
Pretended Friendship, proved His greatest Foes.
But stay! methinks I see our ENGLANDS SUN,
Great BRITAINS Glory, in's Meridian,
Within the Royal Palace of WHITE HALL,
Conducted by our Noble GENERAL;
Whose Valor, Prudence, and Fidelity,
Deserves that GEORGE of ENGLAND styled he be:
Who Prince, and People, Liberties and Laws
Has now restored from the Usurping Paws
Of false Pretenders. Who shall write his Story?
Puts Kings and Kingdoms in their Native Glory.
Long live King CHARLES the Great, the Good, the Just,
Blessed in His Subjects, happy in His Trust:
Long may His Princely Scepter bear Command,
Over our Kingdoms both by Sea and Land.
Thrice welcome our Dread Sovereign, King of Hearts,
This is the Common Suffrage from all Parts:
Both High and Low, both Rich and Poor, they sing
Rejoicing Eccho's for their Sacred King.
Possess and Rule, inherit what is Your own,
You Are BRITAINS Glory, and Your Subjects Crown;
Which done, Posterities to come shall tell,
King CHARLES the Second's without Parallel.
FINIS.
