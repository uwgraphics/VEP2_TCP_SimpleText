The Royoters Ruin, In a Dialogue betwixt a Spend-thrift and a Whore. Or, a
Rlation of a two-penny Bargain.
Of a Spend-thrift proffering two pence to a Whore
Having spent all but that on her before.
The Tune is, He that has most Money is the best Man.




A Lusty young Shaver, a vapouring Gallant,
That vainly had spent, and consumed his estate,
In Taverns and Alehouses wasting his talent
Resolving, repentance did then come too late,
Examining then of his Pocket, he found it
Was very much empty, and he was grown poor,
Quoth he now my Moners gone all to one twopence
I Will make a clear end and spend that on a Whore.
And as along in the streets he was walking
He chanced with one of his Mobs for to meet,
All in her silks and her bravery adorned
With a Complement he there his Mobsie did greet,
Sweet heart if you will go with me to an Alehouse,
And grant me thy pleasure now I am grown poor.
I have but one twopence left, on thee I Will spend it,
Quoth she then go look out your two-penny Whore.
My dearest thou knows my former condition
And how I have spent my estate upon thee
And now for to slight me it breeds my contrition,
And makes me with sorrow tormented to be.
For I have but twopence left, and I will spend it,
On thee, I protest my love I have no more,
Quoth she you may serve for a Pimp to another
For I will be none of your two-penny Whore.


WHen formerly I in my silks was adorned
And obout my neck wore, a fine flanders laced Band
Upon my head was nole's then a Beaver,
What was there then I had not at command
Remember that we two, at that time together,
Took sweet recreation, before I was poor,
Quoth she Sir at that time I was your companion,
And what must I now be your two-penny Whore.
My former acquaintance with nearest relations
Because I before their advise would not take
Do very much slight me, men of reputation
My company shuns, and do me quite forsake,
And bids me go seek for my baudy companions
Where I have consumed my estate all before,
Quoth. she I would have all your friends for to know it
That I will be none of your two-penny Whore.
Thou know that in company we two together
Have caused five pounds to be spent at a Clap
All out of my Pocket O how can thou slight me,
And then could so c^o^ely hug me in thy Lap.
It was for my money and not for my person,
That you did my company so much adore
However I pray thee bestow me this two pence,
Quoth she I will not be your two penny whore.
How often with Oaths, and with great protestation
Engaged you have to be faithful to me,
In weal or in we I should nere be forsaken,
And now all my Coyn's gone, I slighted must be
But yet here^s a two pence left pray thee now take it
And let us do once as we have done before.
Quoth she I nere did for two pence and therefore
Be packing and hunt out your two penny whore.
Wen then my dear Love if you, I not be persuaded
To take this my money because it is small,
Let us do a little, a very, very little
For former acquaintance and that shall be all.
Quoth she, I do scorn for to break my old custom,
Another man I have to wait on therefore
I must bid a farewell both to you and your two pence
For I scorn to be counted a two penny whore.
Quoth she Sir before we depart I will tell you,
I dare undertake, toproscribe you a way
How you may be doing, then let us to an Alehouse
But take notice before, Half a Crown is my pay
Then give your two pence in earnest at present
You shall have your request sir, although you be poor
But this I must tell you before you begin it,
I Will set seven Groats Sir upon your old score.
And thus you may see the condition of wantons
And in what a wanton condition they are,
Before they will leave of their lustful occasions
If they cannot get money they trust out their ware,
They Will keep a man company while his Coin lasts
And never forsake him until he be poor.
And then much ado he shall have with his wanton,
For one single Iobbe to set on the score.
You Gallants and others I wish you be careful,
That have an Estate, lest you vainly (...) waste
And fly evil company, of them be fearful,
Lest into Poverty you should be cast,
And afterward you be forced with submission
To creep unto those where you spent all your store
The best way I know of, for you to prevent i^,
Is to keep your goods out of the hands of a Whore.
