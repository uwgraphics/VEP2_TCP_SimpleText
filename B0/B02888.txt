^HE DEAD MAN'S SONG, Who dwelling was near Basing-hall in London.
To the Tune of, Flying Fam^
SOre sick dear friends long time I was
and veakly la^d in bed,
And for five hours in all men's sight
at leng^h I lay as dead.
The bell rang out, my friends came in,
and I key-cold was found,
Then was my carcass brought from bed
and laid upon the ground.
My loding wife did weep full sore,
my children loud did cry,
My friends did mourn, yet this they said
all flesh is born to die:
My winding sheet prepared was,
my grave was also made;
And for five hours by just report;
in this ^ame case I laid.
During which time my soul did see,
such strange and fearful sights,
That for to hear the same d^^clos'd,
would banish all delights:
Yet since the Lord restored my life;
which from my badie flad;
I will declare the sight I saw,
the time that I was dead.
We thought upon a lovelie green,
where pleasant flowers syrang,
I took my way wo^reas I thought,
the Muses sweetly sang:
The grass was sweet the trees were fair
and lovelie to behold.
And full of fruits was every twig,
which shined like glist'ring gold.
My cheerful heart destred much,
to taste the fruit most fair;
But as I reached a fair young man,
to me did make repair:
Touch not, said he, its none of thins,
but wend and walk with m^;
And see thou mark each several thing,
which I shall show to thee.
I wondered great lie at his words,
yet went with him away,
Till on a goodly pleasant bank,
with him he vade me stay:
With branches then of Lillies white,
mine eyes there wiped be,
When this was done be bade me look,
what I far off could see.
I looked up and lo at last,
I did a City see,
So fair a thing did never man,
behold with mortal eye:
Of diamonds, peales, and precious stones
it seems the walls were made;
The houses all with beaten gold,
were til'd and overlaid.
More brighter then the morning Sun,
the light thereof did show,
And every Creature in the same,
like crowned Kings did go:
The fields about the City fair,
were all with Roles set;
Gillie flowers and Carnations fair,
watch canker could not ^r^t.
And from the fields there did proceed
a sweet and pleasant smell,
That everi^ l^ving Creature felt,
the scene did so ^xcel:
Besides such sweet and pleasant mirth,
did from the City sound,
That I therewith was ravished,
my joy di^ so abound.
Wi^h music, mirth and melody,
P^inc^s did there embrace,
That in my heart I longed to be.
within that bl^ssed place:
The more I gaz^d, the more I might,
the st^h^ pleased me so well:
For wha^ I saw in everte thing,
my tongue can no way tell.
Then of the man I did demand,
what place the same might be,
Whereas so man^e Kings did dwell,
in joy and melody:
Quoth be crat blessed place is heaven,
where yet thou can not rest;
And those that do like Princes walk,
are men whem God has blessed.
Then did he turn me round about,
and on the other side,
He have me view and mark as much,
what things were to be spied:
With that I saw a Coal-black Den,
all tan'd with soot and smook,
Where stoking brimstone burning was,
which made me like to choke.
An uglie creature there I saw,
whose face with knives were slasht,
And in a cauldron of poysend filth.
his uglie corpse was washed:
About his neck were sundry rifts,
that flamed on every side;
I ask^, and lo the young man said,
that he was damned for pride.
Another sort there did I see,
whole bowels Vipers tore,
And grievously with gaping mouth,
they did both yell and roar:
A spoted person by each one,
stood gn^wing on their hearts;
And this was conscience I was told,
that plagued the inward parts.
They were no sooner out of sight,
but straight came in their place,
A sort still corowing burning fire,
which sell against their face:
And Ladies full of melted Gold
were poured down their throats.
An these were set it seemed to me.
in midst of burning boats.
The foremost of the company
was Judas I was told,
Who had for st'thie Lueres sake,
his Lord and Master sold
For covetousness they were condemned
so it was told to me.
And there me thought another rout
of hell hounds I did see.
Their faces they seemed fat in sight,
yet all their bones were hare;
And dishes full of crawling Toads,
were made their finest fare:
From arms, from lands, from thighs and feet
with red hot pincers then,
The flesh was plucked even from the bone
of those vile glutonous men.
On Coal-black beds another sort,
in grievous sort did ly;
And underneath them burning brands,
their flesh did buth and fry:
With brimstone fierce their pillows ^ke
whereon their deads were laid,
And fiends with glowing whips of fire,
their treacherous flesh off fla^d.
Then did I see another come,
stab^d in with dagers ^hick,
And flithy fiends with fiery darts,
their hearts did wound and prick:
And mighty bowls of corrupt blood,
was brought for them to drink:
And these men were for murder plagued
from whence they could not shrink.
I saw when they were gone away,
the swearer and the lyat,
And they were hung up by the tongues
over a flame of fire:
From eyes, from ears, from navel and nose
and from their lower parts,
The blood me thought did rushing run,
and clogged like men's hearts.
I asked why that punishment,
was now answes rors laid,
Because quoth be, wounds heart and blood
were still the cath they made:
And there withal from ugly hell,
such grievous crits I heard,
As though some greater grief and care,
had next them afterward.
So that my soul was sore afraid,
such t^^cour on me tell,
Away then went the young man quite,
and have me not farewell:
Wherefore unto my body straight,
my spirit returned again:
And lively blood did afterward
stretch forth in every v^in.
My closed eyes I opened,
and raised up from my swoend,
I wondered much to see my self.
laid so upon the ground:
Which when my neighbors did behold,
great fear upon them fell,
To whom soon after I did tell.
the news from heaven and hell
FINIS.
