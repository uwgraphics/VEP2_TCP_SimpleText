Here is some comfort for Poor Cavaleeres: OR,
The Duke of Yorks Speech to the Parliament of England, concerning his Fathers
old Soldiers; also, a brief Relation of the forty five sail of Ships that have
crossed the Ocean with a numerous company of English Gallants; Prince Robert does
represent the Kings Royal person in Portugal.

They Will fetch a Queen with store of Indian Treasure
Will make old Cavies laugh beyond all measure.
To a pleasant tune called Moncks March, or, Maids will say nay and take it.




OLd Cavaleers
prick up your ears
That have been Loyal hearted,
unto the King
in every thing
And never from him started;
though many a year
it does appear
By Rebels you were slighted,
but at the last
when sorrow's past
You now shall be requited,
You that did fight,
for Charles his Right,
against the new inventions,
The Parliament
does give consent
That you shall all have Pensions.
The Duke of York
that valiant spark
These words rehearsed rather,
why should not they
receive some pay
That ever loved my Father?
as well as those
that were his foes,
And sought the lands confusion:
a cursed thing
they brought their King
Unto his dissolution:
You that did fight
for Charles his Right,
against the new inventions;
the Parliament
does give consent
That you shall all have Pensions.
The second part
to the same Tune:
YOur wounds and scars
in Charles his Wars
They shall not be forgotten,
although he is dead,
and buried
And's Royal bones are rotten,
yet now his Heir
sits in the Chair
Of Judgment Right and Reason,
his Fathers friends
he will make a mends
And punish knaves for Treason.
You that did fight, etc.
Such news I hear
you need not fear
Will make you blithe and jolly
't will make you laugh
and merrily quaff
To drink away melancholy,
contented be
until you see
Our Royal King is Married;
you shall be pai'd
be not afraid
Though you long time have tarried,
You that did fight, etc.
A famous Fleet,
with men discreet,
To Portugal is Sailing,
to fetch our Queen
which will be seen
With happiness prevailing:
her virtues are,
beyond compare
If truth may be believed,
then Cavies all
both great and small
Rejoice and not be grieved.
You that did fight, etc
On Mid-summer-day
they Lanched away
To fetch that Royal pattern,
Prince Robert he
the man must be
That must salute Queen Kathern:
in Armor bright
a braver sight
Never seen in any Nation,
a sword between
him and the Queen
That is all Europe's fashion,
You that did fight, etc.
Both Lords and Knights
for their delights,
Did make such preparation,
to cross the Seas,
their minds to please,
to see Queen Katherine's Nation.
a braver show
for truth I know
In Europe cannot be raised,
for solid men
I say again
Th'ar' worthy to be praised.
You that did fight, etc.
At their return
bone-fires will burn
And English Bells be ringing.
true Loyal hearts,
throughout all parts
For joy will then be singing,
oth' marriage day,
we will dance and play,
In spite of Quakers yauling,
if Vivat Rex
their spirits vex,
we will thump them for their bauling,
You that did fight, etc.
Our King God bless,
with happiness,
And every one that loves him,
will firmly stand,
at his command,
As it does right behove them,
the Clergy men,
with Tongue and Pen,
Confute will every wigeon,
in spite of Spain
they will maintain
True Protestant Religion,
You that did fight
for Charles his right
against these new inven^ions,
the Parliament
does give consent
That you shall all have Pensions.
