The Seamans sorrowful Bride
See here the constant mournful Bride,
In sorrow does complain;
For fear her joy and hearts delight,
Should never return again.
To the Tune of, Ah! jenny Gin.






My Love is on the brackish Sea,
and I am on this side,
'Twould break a poor young creatures heart,
that lately was a Bride:
That lately was a joyful Bride,
so pleasent to the eye,
But Hollands Land, does me withstand,
and part my Love and I.
The Love that I in heart have chose,
I therewith am content,
The floating Sea shall dried be,
before I will repent:
But cruel Fate my joys arrest,
it cannot helped be,
Whilst I do cry, most mournfully,
fate parts my Love and me.
O gentle Neptune be so kind,
to send him back again,
He never will be out of my mind,
that now has crossed the Main:
Oh hapless Bride, so soon to loose
the pleasure of thine eye,
But rigid fate, my bills does hat^
and parts my Love and I.




No sleep shall give my troubled mind
a comfortable hour,
For while my Love is on the Main,
fears do my joys devour:
And cery blast that blows, I fear,
my Love should drowned lie,
But it is a grief, beyond relief,
so Love for thee i will dye.
Ah! cruel Fate, too much unkind,
why do thou serve me so?
Give easy to my destressed mind,
and banish all my woe*
For I shall never be at rest,
till I my Love do see,
Then gentle mind, be sure be kind,
never part my Love and me.
You sturdy Rocks be sure give way,
and let my Love sail by,
For if he should be made your Prey,
in what a case were I:
Or if the waves should cruel prove,
which I never hope to spy,
I should be lost, and strangely crossed,
to part my Love and I.
Blow wind and send a happy Gale,
that he may home return,
If thou but fill his prosperous Sail
I need no longer mourn:
My happiness will be complete,
when him I chance to see,
Now I lament, in discontent,
since Fate parts him and me.
You powerful Stars that Mortals rule,
mind but my sad complaint,
And send me home my Love again,
that now am like to faint:
I sigh, I pant, I waste away,
no pleasures can I see,
Since my Delight, is out of sight,
and fate parts him and me.
Now must I blame the cruel wind
that sent my Love away,
O fates, why were you so unkind,
as not to let him stay:
Just in the bud of all my joys,
could you so cruel be,
To banish hence, my Love, my Prince,
and part my Love and me.
Is it in vain to sigh and mourn,
unhappy then am I,
Or now because I am forlorn,
must I in sorrow dye?
No, no, I hope there is joys in store,
that I may live to see,
Though now oppressed, I may be blessed,
Heavens bless my Love and me.
The Seaman's Answer.
Leave off thy tears my only joy,
since I am safe arrived:
Let not this grief my Love destroy,
nor be of hopes deprived;
For I Will embrace thee in my Arms,
and fill thee with such bliss;
That Venus with her dallying Charms.
envies our happiness.
Though I upon the Seas was tossed,
when absent from my Dear:
Fearing each moment to be lost,
yet this my comfort were:
That I should safe again return,
which now I find is true;
And since I in Loves passion burn,
I bid the Seas adieu.
Now we will revel day and night,
within each others Arms;
In thee shall be my chief delight,
I Will shield thee from all harms,
Kindly thy body I Will embrace,
and ever constant be.
No other joys shall e're take place,
I Will live and dye with thee.
