Sir William of the West: OR, The Entire Love and Courship, between a Noble
Knight and Beautiful Mary; a Minister's Daughter in Dorsetshire.
Tune of The Ring of Gold.
Lincensed according to Order.





YOung William met his Love
taking her Pleasure,
Whom he did prize above
all Worldly Treasure;
When she appeared in sight,
said he, sweet Jewel
Thou art my heart's delight
O! be not Cruel.
Let me one smile in enjoy
thy heart surrender,
Love be no longer Coy
To thy Pretender;
My fading Ioys restore
Why should thou grieve me?
Thy Charms I do adore,
dearest believe me.
Mary my only Joy
pity thy Lover
Do not my Life destroy
while I discover,
How I am here inflamed
by thy fair Beauty
Sure I cannot be blamed
to own my Duty.
I am commanded so
In Cupid's Power,
Darts from whose fatal Bow
soon will Devour
My Life, if I deny
To fall before thee,
Therefore Love, live or dye
I will adore thee.
Five hundred pounds a year
I am possesing,
And if thou will my dear,
grant me the Blessing,
Thou shall be Dame of all
I cannot deny thee,
If now in Love I shall
dearest, lie by thee.
Here take both heart and hand
I dearly love thee
No lady in the Land
shall shine above thee,
The same shall ever hold
no Friend shall check thee,
In Robes of shining Gold
and Pearl I Will deck thee.
Love had I now this day
The Gold of Craesus
I Would not be drawn away;
kind Heaven bless us:
Still will I dote on thee,
this is no Story,
Thou should a Partner be
of all my Glory.
The Damsel then replied
If you are Loyal
I yield to be your Bride
without denial:
Gain but my Friends Good will,
Father and Mother,
Whom I have honored still,
above all other.
When you have their Consent,
that we should marry,
Then I am well content,
long will not tarry;
At their Discretion I
still will be guided,
Who from my Infancy
for me provided.
I hope said he, my Love,
They Will not deny me,
If my sweet tender Dove
will but stand by me.
With that he straight did go
in hopes to have her;
They never answered no,
but freely gave her.
She was a fair young Dame,
A Parson's Daughter;
He from a Baron came,
of whom hereafter
A large Account I Will give
When I have leisure,
How they in Triumph live,
Joy, Peace, and Pleasure.
