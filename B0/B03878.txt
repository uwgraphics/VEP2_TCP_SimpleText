An Honest man's delight:
OR Knavery made known.
When truth and honesty are joined together
They make a man fear neither wind nor weather
He goes about his business with delight
Because its always honest just and right
He covets nothing for he is content
With that same portion which is to him sent,
And owns this truth for cannot be denied
He Is true and honest, then let the world slide.
To the Tune of, I Will hold thee Five Shillings.
I Have been a travellor
Thi^ty three years,
And seen many passages
As it appears
The Proverb says great Fishes
Eats up the small,
And some men devours
Widows houses and all,
Such covetous Cormorants
I cannot abide,
I Am poor true and honest,
Then let the world slid.
I have hea^d how some Landlords
Their Tenants make poor,
By raising their Rents for to
Maintain a Whore,
For whoreings ith fashion
At this present time,
Some great ones ith nation
Are gui^ty oath Crime.
When they hear these verses.
They will me deride,
I Am poor true and honest
Then let the world slide.
Term time Size and Sessions
What doings is made,
Twixt Lawyer and Cliant
In matter of trade,
Their money must down ere
A word can be spoke
Because that each Lawyer
Must needs have a Cloak,
You know what I mean therefore
Don't me deride,
I Am both true and honest
Then let the world slide.
A wise man had better to
Pocket up wrong,
Then be amongst Lawyers
In midst of their throng
With your Adversary
Agree if you please
Because that the Cure is worse
Then the disease.
Therefore take my counsel
What ever betide,
For i am true and honest
Then let the world slide.




IF all men were like mo
We Would take such a course
Two Lawyers completely
Should ride on one horse
If men were but honest
And would live in awe
A good conscience might rule them
As well as the Law
For strife and contention
I cannot abide
I Am both true and honest
Then let the world slide.
Don't misunderstand me
I am no contender,
Against Law for it is good for to
Punish the offender,
For knaves there is still boys
And will to be sure,
So long as the Sun and the
Moon does endure,
Then find them and tax um
And let them be tried
For i am true and honest
Then let the world slide.
Base filching and stealing
I ever abhorred,
With Couzening and Cheating
I may thank the Lord,
In Corporate places
I dare show my face,
When gallanter fellows
Are put to disgrace,
I fear no town Searjeant
Nor Constables guide,
I Am both true and honest
Then let the world slide.
I am no such fellow
That feign would be rich
The love of much money
My heart cannot bewitch.
If I have but money
My wants to supply,
I am better then they that have
Thousands lie by,
For they are always whyning
And nere satisfied
Whilst i am true and honest
Then let the world slide.
I wonder that men are so
Filled with cares,
T'and doteth so much on these
Worldly affairs,
For Rich men and Wise men
And strong men must dye,
The Prince and the Peasant
In graves they must lie,
I value not Riches, nor
Honor nor Pride,
For i am true and honest
Then let the world slide.
I ask but this question
Of any stout Hector
If he knows what is become of
Old Noll the Protector,
Which once here in England
Was a great commander
And Conquered us Britains
Like great Alexander,
But now all his honors
Are quite laid aside,
Yet i am true and honest
Then let the world slide.
