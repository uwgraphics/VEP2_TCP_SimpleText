HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE King CHARLES II. his DECLARATION To all His Loving
SUBJECTS of the KINGDOM of ENGLAND. Dated from His Court at Breda in Holland,
the 4/14 of April 1660.
And read in PARLIAMENT, MAY, 1. 1660. Together with His MAJESTY'S LETTER of
the same Date, To his EXCELLENCE the LORD GENERAL MONCK, to be communicated to
the Lord President of the COUNCIL of STATE, and to the Officers of the ARMY
under his Command.
CHARLES by the grace of GOD King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith,
To all our loving Subjects of what degree or quality soever, greeting.
If the general distraction and confusion which is spread over the whole
Kingdom, does not awaken all men to a desire and longing that these wounds
which have so many years together been kept bleeding, may be bound up, all we
can say will be to no purpose; However, after this long silence, we have
thought it our duty, to declare how much we desire to contribute thereunto: And
that as we can never give over hope in good time to obtain the Possession of
that Right which GOD and Nature has made our due, So we do make it our daily
suit to the Divine Providence, that He will in Compassion to Us and our
Subjects (after so long misery and sufferings) remit us and put us into a quiet
and peaceable Possession of that Our Right, with as little blood and damage to
Our people, as is possible; Nor do we desire more to enjoy what is Ours, than
that all our Subjects may enjoy what by Law is theirs, by a full and entire
Administration of Justice throughout the Land, and by extending our mercy where
it is wanting and deserved.

And to the end That the fear of punishment may not engage any conscious to
themselves of what is past, to a perseverance in Guilt for the future, by
opposing the quiet and happiness of their Country, in the restoration both of
King, Peers and People, to their just ancient and fundamental Rights: We do by
these presents Declare, That we do grant a full and general Pardon, which we
are ready to pass under our great Seal of England, to all our Subjects of what
degree or quality soever, who within forty days after the publication hereof
shall lay hold upon this our grace and favor, and shall by any public Act
declare their doing so; And that they return to the Loyalty and Obedience of
good Subjects, excepting only such Persons as shall hereafter be excepted by
Parliament, Those only excepted. Let our Subjects how faulty soever, rely upon
the word of a King, solemnly given by this present Declaration, That no Crime
what soever committed against us or our Royal Father before the publication of
this, shall ever rise in judgment, or be brought in question against any of
them, to the least indamagment, either in their Lives, Liberties or Estates, or
(as far forth lies in our power) so much as to the prejudice of their
Reputations, by any reproach or term of distinction from the rest of our best
Subjects. We desiring and ordaining, that hence forward all Notes of discord,
separation and difference of Parties, be utterly abolished among all our
Subjects, whom we invite and conjure to a perfect Union among themselves under
our Protection, for the resettlement of our just Rights and theirs in a free
Parliament; By which upon the word of a King we will be advised.

And because the passion and uncharitablnesse of the times have produced
several opinions in Religion, by which men are engaged in parties and
animosities against each other, which when they shall hereafter unite in a
freedom of conversation will be composed or better understood: We do declare a
Liberty to Tender Consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted or called in
question for differences of opinion in matters of Religion, which do not
disturb the Peace of the Kingdom; And that we shall be ready to consent to such
an Act of Parliament, as upon mature Deliberation shall be offered to us for
the full granting that indulgence: And because in the continued distractions of
so many years, and so many great Revolutions, many Grants and Purchases of
Estates have been made to and by many Officers and Soldiers, and others, who
are now possessed of the same, and who may be liable to Actions at Law upon
several Titles, We are likewise willing that all such differences, and all
things relating to such Grants, Sales and Purchases shall be determined in
Parliament, which can best provide for the just satisfaction of all men who are
concerned.

And we, do further declare, That we will be ready to consent to any Act or
Acts of Parliament to the purposes aforesaid, and for the full satisfaction of
all Arrears due to the Officers and Soldiers of the Army, under the Command of
General MONCK: And that they shall be received into our Service upon as good
pay and conditions as they now enjoy.

Given under our sign Manuel and Privy signet at our Court at Breda this
fourteenth day of April, 1660. In the twelveth year of our Reign.
Received the first of May, 1660.

CHARLES R.
TRusty and Wel-beloved, We greet you well:
It cannot be believed but that We have been, are, and ever must be, as
Solicitous as we can, by all endeavors, to improve the Affections of our good
Subjects at home, and to procure the Assistance of our Friends and Allies
abroad, for the Recovery of that Right, which by the Laws of GOD and Man, is
unquestionable; and of which we have been so long dis-possessed by such force,
and with those circumstances, as we do not desire to agravate by any sharp
expressions, but rather wish, That the Memory of what is passed, may be buried
to the World. That We have more endeavored to prepare, and to improve the
Affections of Our Subjects at home, for Our Restoration, then to procure
assistance from abroad, to invade either of Our Kingdoms, is as manifest to the
World: And We cannot give a better evidence that We are still of the same
mind, then in this Conjuncture, when common reason must satisfy all men, that
We cannot be without Assistance from abroad, We choose rather to send to you,
who have it in your own power, to prevent that Ruin and Desolation which a War
would bring upon the Nation, and to make the whole Kingdom owe the Peace,
Happiness, Security and Glory it shall enjoy, to your virtue; and to
acknowledge that your Armies have complied with their obligations, for which
they were first raised, for the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the
Honor and Dignity of the King, the Privileges of Parliament, the Liberty and
Property of the Subject, and the Fundamental Laws of the Land; and that you
have vindicated that Trust, which others most perfidiously abused and betrayed:
How much we desire and resolve to contribute to those good Ends, will appear to
you by Our enclosed DECLARATION, which We desire you to cause to be Published
for the information and satisfaction of all good Subjects, who do not desire a
further effusion of precious Christian Blood, but to have their Peace and
Security founded upon that which can only support it; an Unity of Affections
amongst our selves, an equal administration of Justice to Men, restoring
Parliaments to a full capacity of providing for all that is amiss, and the Laws
of the Land to their due veneration. You have been your selves Witnesses of so
many Revolutions, and have had so much experience, how far any power and
authority that is only assumed by passion and appetite, and not supported by
Justice, is from providing for the Happiness and Peace of the People, or from
receiving any obedience from them without which no Government can provide for
them, that you may very reasonably believe, that GOD has not been well pleased
with the Attempts that have been made, since He has usually increased the
Confusion, by giving all the success that has been desired, and brought that
to pass without effect, which the Designers have proposed, as the best means
to settle and compose the Nation; And therefore We cannot but hope and believe,
that you will concur with Us in the Remedy We have applied, which, to humane
understanding, is only proper for the Ills we all groan under; And that you
will make your selves the blessed Instruments to bring this blessing of Peace
and Reconciliation upon King and People, it being the usual method in which
Divine Providence delights it self, to use and sanctify those very means
which ill men design, for the satisfaction of private and particualr Ends and
Ambition, and other wicked purposes, to wholesome and public ends, and to
establish that Good which is most contrary to the Designers; which is the
greatest manifestation of Gods peculiar kindness to a Nation, that can be given
in this world. How far we resolve to preserve your Interests, and reward your
Services, we refer to our Declaration; and we hope God will inspire you to
perform your duty to us, and to your native Country, whose happiness cannot be
separated from each other.

We have entrusted our welbeloved Servant, Sir John Greenvile, one of the
Gentlemen of our Bedchamber, to deliver this unto you, and to give us an
Account of your Reception of it, and to desire you in our Name, that it may be
published. And so We bid you farewell.

Given at our Court at Breda, this 4/14 of April, 1660. In the twelfth year of
our Reign.
Received the first of May, 1660.

To our trusty and Welbeloved General MONCK, to be by him communicated to the
President and Council of State, and to the Officers of the Armies under his
Command.
