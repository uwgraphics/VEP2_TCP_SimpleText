That first began the strife,
And caused him to loose his life,
And others did the like,
As well as he.
Yet her Princely Majesty
graciously, graciously,
Has pardon given free
to many of them:
^e has released them quite,
and given them their right,
^hey may pray both day and night
God to defend her.
Shro^e tuesday in the night,
welladay, welladay,
With a heavy hearted spright
as it is said:
The leistenant of the Tower
Who kept him in his power,
At ten a clock that hour,
To him did come.
And said unto him there,
mournefully, mournfully
My Lord you must prepare,
to die to morrow:
Gods will be done quoth he,
Yet shall you strangely see,
God strong in me to be,
Though I am weak.
I pray you pray for me
welladay, welladay,
That God may strengthen me,
against that hour:
Then straightway did he call
The Guard under the wall,
And did entreat them all
For him to pray.
For to morrow is the day,
welladay welladay,
That I the debt must pay,
which I do owe:
It is my life I mean,
wc I must pay my Queen,
Even so has justice given,
That I must do.
In the morning was be brought
welladay welladay:
Where a Scaffold was set up,
within the Tower:
Many Lords were present then,
With other Gentlemen,
Which were appointed then
To see him dye.
You noble Lords quoth he
welladay welladay,
That must the witness be,
of this my death:
know I never loved papistrie
But did It still defy,
And Essex thus did dye,
Here in this place.
I have a sinner been
welladay welladay:
Yet never wronged my Queen
in all mylife,
My God I did offend,
which grie^es me at my end,
May all the rest amend,
I do forgive them.
To the state I never meant ill
welladay, welladay,
neither wished ye commons ill,
in all my life:
But loved all with my heart,
And always took their part
Whereas there was desert,
In any place.
Then mildely did he crave
mournefully mournefully,
He might that favor have
private to pray:
He then prayed heartely,
And with great feruency,
To God thae sits on hie,
For to receive him.
And then he prayed again
mournfully mournfully,
God to preserve his Queen
from all her foes:
And send her long to reign,
True Justice to maintain,
And not to let proud Spain,
Once to offend her.
His gown he slipped of then
welladay welladay,
And put off his hat and band
and hung it by,
Praying still continually,
To God that sits on hie,
That he might patiently,
There suffer death.
My headesman that must be,
then said he cheerefullie,
Let him come here to me,
That I may him see:
Who kneeled to him then,
Art thon (quoth he) the man,
Which art appointed now,
my life to free?
Yes my Lord did he say
welladay, welladay,
Forgive me I you pray
for this your death:
I hear do thee forgive,
And may true justice live,
No foul crime to forgive,
Within their place.
then he kneeled down again,
mournefully mournfully,
And was required by some
there standing by:
To forgive his enemies.
Before death closde his eyes
which he did in hearty wise,
Thanking them for it.
That they would rememher him
welladay, welladay;
That he might forgive al them, leave
that had him wro^g'd:
Now my Lords I take my,
sweet Christ my soul receive
Now when you will prepare,
For I am ready.
He laid his head on the bl^ck
welloday welladay:
But his doublet did let th^e stroke
some there did say:
what must be don (quoth he)
Shall be done presently,
Then his doublet off put he,
and laid down again.
Then his headesman did his part
cruelly, cruelly,
He was never seen to start,
For all the blows:
His soul it is at rest,
in heaven among the blessed,
Where God send us to rest,
(...) it shall please him.
Finnis.
LONDON. Printed by Edward-Allde.

A lamentable new Ballad upon the Earl of Essex death.
To the tune of the Kings last Goodnight.


ALL you that cry, O hone O hone
come now and sing, O Lord with me,
For why our Jewel is from us gone,
the valiant Knight of Chivalry:
Of rich and poor beloved was he,
in time an honorable Knight,
When by our Laws condemd to dye,
and lately took his last Good night.
Count him not like to Saint nor Campion,
(those traitrous men) or Babington,
Nor like the Earl of Westmerland,
by whom a number were undone:
He never yet hurt mothers son,
his quarrel still maintaind the right:
Which makes yt tears my cheeks down run:
when I think on his last Goodnight.
The Portingales can witness be,
his Dagger at Lisbone gate he flung,
And like a knight of Chivalry,
his chain upon the gate he hung:
Would God that he would thither come,
to fetch them both in order right:
Which thing was by his honor done,
yet lately took his last Goodnight.
The Frenchmen they can testify,
the towns of Gourney he took in:
And marched to Roane immediately,
not caring for his foes a pin.
With bullets then he pierced their skin,
and made them flee far from his sight:
He at that time did credit win,
and now has taken his last Goodnight.
And stately Cales can witness well:
even by his Proclamation right,
He did command them all straightly,
to have a care of Infants lives:
That none should ravish maid nor wife,
Which was against their order right:
Therefore they praid for his long life,
which lately took his last Goodnight.
Would God he had never Ireland known,
nor set his feet on Flanders ground:
Then might we well inioyed our own,
where now our Jewel will not be found.
Which makes our woes still to abound,
trickling with salt tears in my sight:
To hear his name in our ears to found,
Lord Deuereux took his last Goodnight.
Ashwednesday that dismal day,
when he came forth of his Chamber door,
Upon the Scaffold there he saw,
his headsman standing him before.
The Nobles all they did deplore,
shedding their salt tears in his sight:
He said, farewell to rich and poor,
at his good morrow and goodnight.
Farewell Elizabeth my gracious Queen,
God bless thee and thy counsel all:
Farewell my Knights of Chivalry,
farewell my soldiers stout and tall:
Farewell the Commons great and small,
into the hands of men I light:
My life shall make amends for all,
for Essex bids the world goodnight.
Farewell dear wife and children three,
farewell my young and tender son,
Comfort your selves mourn not for me,
although your fall be now begun:
My time is come the glass is run,
comfort your selves in former light,
Seeing by my fall you are undone,
your Father bids the world Goodnight.
Derrick thou know at Cales I saved
thy life, lost for a rape there done,
Which thou thy self can testifye,
thine own hand three and twenty hung:
But now thou feast my time is come,
by chance into thy hands I light.
Strike out thy blow that I may know,
thou Essex lou'dst at his goodnight.
When England counted me a Papist,
the works of Papists I defy,
I nere worshipped Saint, nor Angel in heaven,
nor to the Virgin Mary I,
But to Christ which for my sins did dye,
trickling with sad tears in his sight:
Spreading my arms to God on high,
Lord Jesus, receive my soul this night.
FINIS.
