Mr. BVSHEL'S Mineral Overtures.
Right Honorable:
ACcording to your commands, I do here present your Lordships with a brief
Narrative of the Lord Chancellor BACONS directions to my self, for the
management of his Mineral experiments, in case his own death should stop his
intended progress therein, before he could practically discover the true
generation, and spreading qualities of Mines Royal, I being then his Meniall
Servant.

King JAMES having already promised to grant his Lordship all his own
discoveries of Mines Royal, and also of any drowned Lands, or deserted Works
by him to be recovered within the space of 40. years, paying him the fifth
according to the usual custom of the King of Spain, in his Mines of the West
Indies, and of other Princes, after the expiration of 14. years first granted
gratis toward the great charge of his new invention, to facilitate the
obtaining the Mineral riches of this Land, occasioned by a learned Speech his
Lordship had lately made to his Majesty: Count GUNDAMORE, and diverse of the
Nobility being present, concerning the rise, and magnificent growth of the
China Trade, wherein by a perfect demonstration, he made it appear, that the
invention of one man (by his helping the defects of nature, with the materials
of Art, and the patience of three ages industry to bring its concoction to
perfection) became the great Revenue of that Empire, and has been for this
thousand years the only honor of that people, as well as the livelihood of
their patrimony; in which he seriously protested, that his utmost ambition in
the affairs of this world affected no greater glory, then to leave the real
fruits of his best service to his Sovereign, honor to his name, his written
works to posterity, and by such treasures as his own industry should raise out
of his Mineral experimen^s to accomplish the noble design and fabric of his
Solomon's house, described in his Natural History, since the corporation of the
Mines Royal, instituted by his Majesty, consisting of Lords and Gentlemen of
quality, produced but weak, or very small advantages to his Majesty's Revenue,
or the public good, although his Lordship did then really believe it very
possible for himself (if qualified thereto by his Majesty's power) to bring it
so to pass in one age, that the barrenest mountains in this nation should
produce such store of treasure by their beds of mettle that this State should
not need to envy the King of Spains felicity in his POTOSEE, or any other his
silver Mines in America; and thereupon by way of similitude added this, that as
a State, whose present dimentions were but small, might happily serve as a
foundation for an ample Monarchy, if all regard of private propriety were laid
aside, and every member thereof would diligently devote his particular care to
the public benefit: even so it might happen in the advancement of the
discoveries of those Mineral riches supposed to lie hid in the bosoms of the
most barren Mountains, when the whole industry of the many several persons
employed in that work should be concentrick in that service, and act as the
united faculties of one man, their hearts being free from all ends and
ambitious thoughts, save such as conduced to Gods glory and the common good.
But so soon as his Lordship had vouchsafed to acquaint me concerning his
proceedings with his Majesty in this affair, he bad me call to mind the many
fatherly favors, which he had conferred upon me as pious motives to retard my
unripe years from hazardous travels in foreign parts; I having professed to
his Lordship, that I could not with any content resolve to live in my native
Country, since I first understood that younger Brothers by the Law of the Land,
were but to have little share in their fathers inheritance, but that they were
by the ways of virtue and industry, by the assistance of the Almighties
bounty, to acquire such fortunes as primogeniture had conferred upon their
elder brothers, or otherwise to live in an inferior or servile condition, and
then instanced his acceptance of me for his servant at fifteen years of age
upon mine own address, his clearing all my debts three several times, with no
small sums, his preferring me in marriage to a rich inheritrix, and thereupon
allowing me 400 pounds per annum to balance the consent of her Father in the
match; saying, that if those real expressions of his love could but find the
due retalliation of my gratitude, he might then assure himself of the hoped
harvest of two lives in one; inferring, that although fathers are bound to
provide for their children, and worse then Infidels if they do not, yet there
is no such injunction upon Masters in relation to their servants; and therefore
where a Masters pious bounty transcends a Fathers natural love, there that so
obliged servant must appear most prodigiously ungrateful, which shall not with
much zeal and faithfulness discharge the duty of a surviving trust, seriously
adding this: BUSHEL, I must now use you my intended instrument, in the
prosecution of my Mineral designs, as politic Princes do their nearest
servants in their Cabinet Counsels, who putting their masters conceptions into
act, if they take well with the people, must own no more of them then the
approbation thereof, and the admiration of their Princes wisdom therein; but
in case of miscarriage, to salve their Princes honor, they must sadly
acknowledge the matter wholly their own, an Error in their Counsels, and a
Crime in themselves; so you if by my Theory you prosper in your practick, must
attribute all the honor of the whole work to me; if otherwise, you must
gratefully preserve my reputation, by acknowledging your own misfortune in
mistaking and misacting my directions, and so you shall be sure to gain the
Title and Character of a grateful servant in either event. And upon my serious
protestation, that I would faithfully and curiously obey all his Commands
concerning his Mynerall directions and designs, his Lordship first advised me,
not to follow the practice of our Predecessors in their tedious and expensive
ways of sinking Ayreshaffes at every forty Fathomes in search of the uncertain
Veyns, nor to immitate the Ancient Romans byd^gging Mines through deep and
open Trenches; but to observe his directions by cutting my Addits into the
Mountains at the lowest Level of all drowned and deserted works, and by
supplying the defect of the Air in my far led Addits by Pipe and Bellows,
being an Invention utterly unknown to former Ages. And for my first experience,
to begin with those five Mountains in Cardiganshire, upon a view thereof by Sir
FRANCIS GODOLPHIN, and a Portugues (men of great experience in Mines) reported
by them to be rich in Silver and Lead. But if I should by my practick part
fail in my deeper search either for want of convenient Air, or a sufficient
Veyn of Ore, his Lordship commanded me to pursue his directions in that
particular no further; yet if my happy success should prove his Theory true in
this, as also in the several ways of seperating the Mettle from the Dross,
and the Silver from the Lead, that then I should not fail to illustrate the
innocent Trade of the poor Mines, by making his Lordship the Patron of their
profession, and my self one of their society, according to the many obligations
of his Lordships forementioned favors, hereby performing the duty of a
faithful servant therein: And for my further discoveries of the Treasures of
other Mountains, which have the same Symptoms of Rakes, Veyns, and Sparres, his
Lordship conceived it most necessary for me, to dedicate the whole profit,
which Gods providence should reveal in the one to the finding out of the
Riches of the other; and as a first help in this work he counsels me to
petition my Sovereign: That for the agrandizing his Royal Clemency and
Magnificence, he would graciously grant life to such as had offended in petty
Felonies, and were willing to expiate their crimes by their diligent and daily
labors in his Majesty's Mines, and if possible to obtain a Branch of his
Majesty's Mint to encourage all Foreign and Native Miners, with due and certain
payment, according to the president of other Princes, and not force them to
take base Commodities at high rates for their painful service, as has been
enforced by some former undertakers, which I fear has entayled a Curse upon
their fraudulent policies. But above all, that I should take a special care
conscienciously to elect such honest Agents for the carrying on this innocently
profitable work, whose virtuous ambitions should aim at nothing beyond the
public good of their Country, and a competent sallary for their modest
maintenance: But these Embrions proving abortive by the sudden fall and death
of that Lord in the Reign of King James, were the sad motives which persuaded
my pensive retireme^ts to my three years unsociable solitude in the desolate
Isle called the Calfe of Man, where (abhorring the memory of my desol^te
exorbitances) in obedience to my dead Lords Philosophical advice: I resolved
to make a perfect exp^riment upon my self for the obtaining a long and healthy
life, m^st necessary for such a repentance, as my former debauchedness required
by a parcimonious diet of Herbs, Oil, Mustard, and Honey, with water
sufficient, most like to that of our long-lived Fathers before the flood (as
was conceived by that Lord) which I most strictly observed, as if obliged by a
religious vow, till divine providence calling me to a more active life. I
discovered and perfected natures ingenious designs upon my rock at Enston in
Oxfordshire, by making it such an artificial delightful Grotto, that the fame
of it invited the late K. Charles to a voluntary visit. By which opportunity I
not only became known to his Majesty, but also found an apt occasion to
discourse the above mentioned Proposals of the Lord BACON to his own attentive
ear, who so well approved of my Engine upon that place, and his Lordships
Mineral model, that he presently promised me the assistance of his Mint
when I should in those mountains of Cardigan, find silver worth the Coining;
and likewise the accommodation of my own Lead so discovered, Custom free for
21. years, as also my choice of renting the whole Custom of that Commodity at
the rate of the Farmers Books, calculated by the Account of 7. years Audit,
whenever I should procure to my self the Assignment of Sir HUGH MIDDLETONS
Lease of the Mines Royal in the County of Cardigan, to put the speculations of
my dear deceased Master into practice. These high favors of the late King
conferred on my self, in memory of that Lords eminent abilities, and this his
admonition (before the Earl of Dorset) to me at York. That (if in the war then
like to ensue) I should not prove real, and active in his service, and
cordial in the trust reposed in me by my quondam Lord, I should justly merit
the title and reputation of a Knave; which did then provoke me forwards in my
undertakings, with a most zealous observation of my obliged fidelity to both,
till his Majesty (at CAUSAM) disingaged me in the first, that he might enable
me, as much as in him lay, to perform the latter, by his gracious Letter of
per^^ssion (...) ^^der Lundy, at my own charge fortified and main^ained,
without ^njury or violence to any, upon such Articles as might take o^^ (...)
delinquency, and restore me to my estate, and the Grants of my Mines, Mints,
and Customs, rather then the forementioned design so well digested by my
Honorable Lord, for the general good, should be made frustrate by my
incapacity to prosecute it; I being the only man intimately made privy to all
those his Mineral speculations, and some other of his Philosophical
Lucubrations, not yet to be promulged, until my proficiency and success in
the Mines shall enable me thereunto: which makes me now become an humble and
earnest Petitioner to this State, for their pious assistance in this hopeful
work, for the good of this Common Wealth, and their own Honors: since I have
taken the Engagement, and given security for my future integrity, desiring no
greater riches or honor in this world, then to gratify the late Civilities of
those my friends which gave me credit, and by my utmost industry to manifest
the great debt of love and honor I ow to the worthy memory of that unparalleld
Lord, by redeeming my self in the service and opinion of my Country. For I
protest, as in the presence of God, that if I could now command as much wealth
as ever the Lidian CRESSUS did possess, I would gladly adventure it all in
perforating the barren Mountains to discover the vast Treasures which lie hid
in their Rocky entrayles, for the good of this Common Wealth, and to leav to
after Ages a Magnificent Monument in pious Memory of my most deserving Master,
by finishing his SALOMONS house in all its dimensions, and with all the
accomodations and endowments thereof, according to his Lordships own Heroic
Idea. And to that end I humbly tender these my proposalls. First, to advance
the Mineral Trade of this Common Wealth, to 1000l. per week, if the Parliament
shall be pleased to ratify to me the same Latitude of Power to effect it,
which King JAMES granted to the Lord Chancellor BACON, and was since conferred
by King CHARLES on my self, for the encouragement of me and mine assistants in
the work; but if any unsatisfied concerned person shall object against the
tedious Proposition of a 14. years period before my Mountains must bring forth
this vast birth, and then peradventure expect but a ridiculous silver Mouse
after this Timpany of promises. To beget more candor in such, and a better
confidence in all, as a hopeful symptom of a lively Embrion, promising a
larger offspring, I shall in the interim give Marts to all such responsive
persons that shall be diffident of the success, and also duly pay all such
Rent as is now received by the State from the Farmers of the Mines and Customs
of Lead; and likewise engage my Life and Fortune, that the clear fifth part
shall be worth to this State 500l. the week; and in the same process of 14.
years more, it shall be worth 1000l. the week. I having many noble friends that
will adventure their money gratis for 14. years, to manifest their love to
their Country; and to see the perfection of those Experiments in the L. BACONS
Philosophy, I having already by his direction cut through five of the 28.
Mountains at the lowest Level, which his Lordship and Sir FRANCIS GODOLPHIN,
did mark out as the most pregnant Hills for discovering the Beds, and spreading
Branches of this Nations Mineral Treasure; so that no man of known judgment
but must conclude the rest to be of the same species, or of richer natures, in
their deeper search both for quantity and quality.
