A PROCLAMATION, Anent the SALT.
Edinburgh, the ninth day of March, one thousand six hundred and seventy one.
CHARLES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith;
To (...) Macers or Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly
and severally specially constitute, Greeting.
Forasmuch as it has always been Our great care, for the good of Our Subjects
in this Our ancient Kingdom, to improve and encourage the Manufactories
thereof; And considering, that by the excessive importation of Foreign Salt,
and the applying thereof to all domestic and ordinary uses, contrary to the
intent of many good Laws made thereanent, the ancient and useful Manufactory of
Salt is like to be ruined, and many thousands of poor people who are thereby
maintained, in hazard to be brought to extreme poverty: And finding also, that
by the unlimited importation of Foreign Salt, We are frequently defrauded of
Our Custom and Excise due to Us out of the same, notwithstanding of all
endeavors in the contrair. We therefore, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy
Council, do hereby prohibit and discharge all persons whatsoever, either
Natives or Forraigners, without the particular License of the Lords
Commissioners of Our Thesaury, to import any Salt into this Our Kingdom, from
and after the tenth day of April next, in this instant year of God, one
thousand six hundred and seventy one years, under the pain of confiscation to
Our behoove of the same, and of the Ships and Vessels in which the same happens
to be imported. And Ordains these presents to be printed, and published at the
Mercat-crosse of Edinburgh and other places needful, that none pretend
ignorance.
