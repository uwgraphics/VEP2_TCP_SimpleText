THE Deceiver deceived: Or, The Virgins Revenge.
Those that in Loves wide Grove delight to range,
And please themselves with pretty charming change,
Delight to triumph over the softest spoils
Of yielding Beauty, seldom escape the toiles,
For Love to take them has a thousand wiles.
Tune of, Ah cruel bloody fate!
This may be printed,

R. LS.







Man. AH cruel Maid give ore
to punish him with scorn
Who has for you in store
a flame as bright as morn.
Come dear be kind the Powr's of Love
their Virtues misimploy'd
To make with such care, a Creature so fair*
if not to be enjoyed.

Maid. Tell me no more; in vain
will all your Courtship prove
I smile to hear you feign
a false pretended love:
What Gr^ve is free from broken vows;
to yielding Virgins made
whom you let languish in their anguish*
when to Love betrayed*

Man. It Is true some gentle hours
I trifl'd in their arms
Yet no sweet face but yours
could make me own its Charms
The feeble Beauties they displaid
each moment seemed to wast
But yours my delight, is so dazzling bright
it must for ever last,

Maid. So flattered your smooth Tongue:
so were your looks addressed
Such smiles about you hung,
such liking you expressed;
To those whose senceless hearts you gaind
those now that mourn their fate
In being undone, by trusting too soon:
though sighs are breathed too late.





Man. That's their own fault, in have
to entertain a flame,
Which in their cheeks could blast
The Lillies and Rose's stain:
Disarm them of those killing beams
which in your eyes appear
Those eyes which are bright, those eyes by whose light
my course, love bids me steer.

Maid. In vain you try my heart
no Conquest there you will gain,
Too feeble is your art
to make me suffer pain,
You seek a triumph there in vain
no Trophy you shall boast
But in what so fain you would now obtain
you shall be ever cross.

Man. Such cruelty cannot live
within so fair a breast
A milder sentence give
to me with love oppressed,
O to a flame that burns like mine
some speedy Cordial ply
Or he that till now, Love never made vow
for love of you must dye.

Maid. No more of love to me
though you in earnest were
As deaf as Seas I Would be,
for love i would give despair
Revenge the wrongs the softer sex
sustain by your false wiles
Revenge false man, the Nymph that's undone
by your deluding smiles.

Man. Just is your doom bright maid
just the disdain you show
With scorn for scorn i am paid
the powers thus let me know
What it is to sigh and pine for love
since I unmoved could see
Beauties with tears and their tender ^ears
kind Virgins sigh for me.

FINIS.
