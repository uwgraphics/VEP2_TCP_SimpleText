The FRIAR well Fitted;
OR, A pretty Jest that once befell,
How a Maid put a Friar to cool in the Well.

To a Merry Tune.




AS I lay musing all alone,
fa, la, la, la, la,
A pretty jest I thought upon,
fa, la, la, la, la,
Then listen a while, and I will you tell,
Of a Friar that loved a bonny Lass well
fa, la, la, la, la,
fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly.
He came to the Maid when she went to bed
fa, la, etc.
Desiring to have her Maidenhead,
fa, la, etc.
But she denied his desire,
And told him, that she feared Hell Fire;
fa, la, etc.
Tush (quoth. the Friar) thou needst not
fa, la, etc.
If thou were in hell I could sing thee out doubt
fa, la, etc.
Then (quoth. the maid) thou shall have thy request,
The Friar was glad as a Fox in his nest
fa, la, etc.
But one thing (quoth she) I do desire,
fa, la, etc.
Before you have what you require,
fa, la, etc.
Before that you shall do the thing,
An Angel of money thou shall me bring,
fa, la, etc.
Tush (quoth the Friar) we shall agree,
fa, la, etc.
No money shall part my Love and me;
fa, la, etc.
Before that I will see thee lack,
I Will pawn my gray Gown from my back
fa, la, etc.
The Maid bethought her of a wile,
fa, la, etc.
How she the Friar might beguile,
fa, la, etc.
While she was gone the truth to tell,
She hung a Cloth before the Well;
fa, la, la, la, la,
fa, la, la, lang-tree-down-dilly.




THe Friar came as his covenant was
fa, la, etc.
With money to his bonny Lass,
fa, la, etc.
Good mo^row fair Maid, good morrow, (quoth. he)
Here is the money I promised thee;
fa, la, la, la, la,
fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly.
She thankt the man, and she took his money
fa, la, etc.
Now let us go to it, (quoth. he) sweet honey
fa, la, etc.
Oh stay (quoth. she) some respite make,
My Father comes he will me take;
fa, la, etc.
Alas (quoth. the Friar) where shall I run,
fa, la, etc.
To hide me till he be gone,
fa, la, etc.
Behind the Cloth run thou (quoth. she)
And there my Father cannot thee see,
fa, la, etc.
Behind the Cloth the Friar crept,
fa, la, etc.
And into the Well on a sudden he leapt,
fa, la, etc.
Alas (quoth he) I am in the Well,
No matte (quoth. she) if thou were in Hell;
fa, la, etc.
Thou say thou could sing me out of Hell,
fa, la, etc.
Now prithee sing thy self out of the well,
fa, la, etc.
The Friar sung on with a pitiful sound,
Oh help me out, or I shall be drowned;
fa, la, etc.
I trow (quoth she) your courage is cooled
fa, la, etc.
(Quoth the Friar) I never was so fooled,
fa, fa, etc.
I never was served so before,
then take heed (quoth. she) thou come there no more,
fa, la, etc.
(Quoth he) for sweet Saint Francis sake
fa, la, etc.
On his Disciple some pity take,
fa, la, etc.
(Quoth she) Saint Francis never taught
His Scholars to tempt young Maids to naught;
fa, la, etc.
The Friar did entreat her still,
fa, la, etc.
That she would help him out of the well,
fa, la, etc.
She heard him make such piteous moan
She helped him out, and bid him be gone
fa, la, etc.
(Quoth he) shall I have my money again
fa, la, etc.
Which from me thou have beforehand taken
fa, la, etc.
good sir (said she) there is no such matter,
I Will make you pay for fouling my water,
fa, la, etc.
The Friar went all along the Street,
fa, la, etc.
Dropping wet, like a new-wash'd Sheep
fa, la, etc.
Both old and young commended the Maid
That such a witty prank had played,
fa, la, la, la, la,
fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly.
