THE Shepherds Complaint: AND THE Comforting Shepherdess.
Poor Coron making his Complaint
was comforted at last;
But when he thought himself half dead,
his Silvia held him fast.
To the Tune of, Maggys Jealousy.






OH Cupid thou now art too cruel,
to use a poor Lover severe
Thou do to my flame add a fuel,
that costs me full many a tear:
Then cease to be so out of reason;
and let me no longer complain,
But grant me some ease for a season,
and ease all my sorrow and pain.
Whilst others do sweetly lie sleeping,
I sigh by my self all alone,
My eyes they are swelled with weeping,
no sorrows like mine e're was known:
But whilst to my self I do pine,
I do find all my sorrow in vain,
For my love she will never be so kind,
as to banish my sorrow and pain.
Ah! Silvia, be cruel no longer,
to him that thy beauty adores,
Thy Charms they grow stronger and stronger,
then let thy soft tears wash my sores:
Which I for thy sake have endured
though thou do my service disdain,
I Am certain they cannot be Cured,
but I must e'ne dye of my pain.
What profit Love is it unto thee,
to frown a poor Lover to death?
And murder the man that does woo thee,
thus strangely to stiffle his breath?
My dear I do humbly entreat thee,
to grant me my freedom again,
For certainly if thou do cheat me,
I languish 'twixt sorrow and pain.
But in vain do I beg for a freedom,
when Cruelty locks up the door,
If young men they once would but heed'um
they would never love Beautys no more:
Then he but as kind as you are fair,
and we shall no longer complain,
But now we for death must prepare,
and dye with extremes of our pain.
The Woman's Answer.
What makes my dear shepherd to languish
and sigh out his pitiful moan
I bleed at the thoughts of his anguish,
he knows that I love him alone:
But yet he does seem to be jealous,
of some that do graze on the Plain,
But I think he has very few fellows,
and therefore i will constant remain.
He talks of the pains he endured,
and suffered all for my sake,
I Am wounded and cannot be cured,
and my heart it is ready to break;
But Coron is still a reviling,
the truest that lives on the Plain,
No longer then I am a smilling,
but he feels a terrible pain.
If I should be-always a Kissing,
the world would my folly admire,
The Shepherds at us would lie hissing,
and hinder what he does desire:
But i will in a corner embrace him,
that he may no longer complain,
At night in my bosom i will place him,
for to banish his sorrow and pain.
Was ever poor Shepherdess kinder,
then now I do promise to be?
How can he then choose but mind her,
that loves so unchangeably?
He cannot enjoy greater bliss,
then with his true Love to remain,
That each minute will give him a kiss,
for to banish his sorrow and pain.
You Lovers take pattern by me then,
that has vowed to be constant till death
For all Loyal Shepherds to see then,
that I at the losing my breath,
Was free from all kind of deceit,
and a wavering mind did disdain,
Now kindness I once more repeat,
and I waste with my horrible pain.
FINIS.
