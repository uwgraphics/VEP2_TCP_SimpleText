THE COALIER LASSIE
A NEW SONG To it is own proper Tune.
THe Coalier had a Daughter,
And she is wondrous bonny;
But if your had once brought her
To a true sense of Joy,
Although she strugle for a while
yet you will won about her,
If once her Heart you can beguile
you will never go without her.
Although at first she may deny,
yet you must pursue her:
Her Modesty will make her cry,
your Rudeness will undo her.
But with a forward brisk Address
unto the point intended;
First you must Kiss and then Caress,
and so the Matter's ended.
This was the method that I used
while she was denying;
And ay the more that she refused
the more I was applying:
Till the Key of her Virginity
to me she did deliver;
Though I like not the Affinity
to receive it was clever.
How happy then is the Landwart
that is the Coaliers Master
For he may speak a word with her Lord
when she lies down to rest her.
And when her Father's at his Kaill,
and from his hand not mist her:
I Will warrant you she will never sail
to thank the Lad last kissed her.
FINIS.
