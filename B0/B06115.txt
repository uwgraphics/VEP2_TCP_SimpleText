TO THE HONORABLE, THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS AND BURGESSES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
IN PARLIAMENT.
The Humble Petition of Aldermen, Common-Cournel-men, Subsidy-men, and other
Inhabitants of the City of LONDON, and the Suburbs thereof.
SHOWS,
That they do with all humble thankfulness ackowledge that great labor and
care, which this honorable Assembly has undergone now for the space of above
one whole years, endeavoring the reformation and removal of those many
pressures and grievance in Church and Commonwealth; And do humbly present that
grateful acceptance and high esteem, which not only the Petitioners, but also
all well affected to the honor of this Majesty and prosperity of this Kingdom
have, of these your great and unwearied endeavors, which although they (by
reason of the Popish Lords and Bishops Voting in the House of Peers, and other
impediments as they humble conceive) have not hitherto produce those happy
effects you aimed at; Yet, to the Petitioners great comfort, diverse of those
pressures are already removed: as Arbitary Courts, Shipmoney, Monopolies, and
other illegal Impositions, where with they burdened, and further hopes given
by the happy Act of this PARLIAMENTS continuance.

That (notwithstanding all this) the Papists and their adherents, whose malice
cease not, have by sundry secreat and desperate plots, attempted the ruin
and destruction of this State and Kingdom, and however some of them have
hitherto by Gods providence, and your prudence, been discovered and become
abortive: Yet the sad effects of other of them, are not only felt, and much
more feared in this Realm of England, but also have of late broken out into
open Rebellion in Ireland, where most barbarous, savage, cruel, and inhumane
actions are practiced toward our Brethren by Nation and Religion, whose
lamentable and deplored condtion the Petitioners much pity and lament, and
have just cause to fear, that as already there has been much Christian blood
spilt, so in short times, if speedy help be not sent, not only the many great
Debts there owing to diverse of the Petitioners, and others of this Kingdom,
will be wholly lost, but (which is far more) the very name of the English and
Protestant Religion there, will be rooted out, which those Rebels (the
Foundation of whose Religion is written in letters of blood) do only oppose.

And for that diverse of the Petitioners receive daily information from all
parts of this Kingdom, of the bold insolent carriage, and threat^^ing speeches
of the Papists in this Realm, arising (as the Petitioners humbly conceive) not
only from the prevailing of the Rebels in Ireland, ^ut also from the want of
such secure and speedy course against Papists here, as the present condition of
this Kingdom requires, and this honorable Assembly has earnestly
endeavored.

From which grounds, the Petitioners cannot omit to represent unto you, the
great terrors, fears, and distraction, that they lie under, of a ^^ddaine
surprise by their bloody hands, By means whereof, the Trading of this City and
Kingdom is much more of late decayed, then it ^ath been for diverse years past,
no man following his Trade cheerfully, while the lives of himself and Family,
and the public safety of the ^ingdome are in danger; and while he knows not
how soon they may feel the like cruelty and inhumanity from the Papists, and
their ad^erents, as these in Ireland have done, which if ever it shall happen,
this honorable Assembly must expect to have a deep share in their malice and
cruelty, against whom they have already by themselves and their Abbettors
endeavored, to raise a disrespect in the hearts of the people, to ^^vide
between the King Majesty and his Parliament, and seditiously to misconstrue the
Citizens dutiful and loyal entertainment of his Ma^^sty, to be a differting
of this honorable Assembly, the least thought whereof, the Petitioners do
utterly detest and abhor.

To the end therefore, that the destructive plots of the Papists and their
adherents may be defeated, the grounds of their hopes and insolences removed,
confidence Forces with all expedition sent subdue those abominable and bloody
Rebels in Ireland; This City Kingdom, (for prevention of the like mischiefs
here, and securing the peace thereof) put into a posture of defense, the
Petitioners freed from their fears, encouraged in their Trades, and in due
time receive such just Answers to their former Petitioners, as shall seem best
to your great wisdoms.

It is humbly prayed, that you will vouchsafe to be a means to the Kings
Majesty and the House of Peers, that life may be speedily given to your good
endeavors by their concurrence with you in the punishing of Delinquents, and
redressing the pressures and grievances in Church and Commonwealth (amongst
which the abuses crept into the ancient government of this City, they humbly
desire may in due time be taken into consideration.) And for the better
effecting hereof, that the Popish Lords and Bishops may be removed out of the
House of Peers, as was desire in the presence of diverse of this honorable
Assembly, by the representative body of this City in this Guild Hall, when
50000 li. was freely lent to raise Forces for Ireland, the greatest part
whereof was speedily brought in by the Petitioners.

And the Petitioners who well know their own safeties, are wrapped up in yours,
shall not fail to put up daily Prayers to Almighty God for your good success,
and to maintain and defend, to the utmost hazard of their lives and estates
(according to their late Protestation) the Kings Majesty, and high Court of
Parliament, against all wicked Counselors, and malignant opposers, who
endeavor, either by secret plot or open force, to prejudice the one or the
other, or to make division between his Majesty and the Parliament, whom God and
the Laws of this Land, have united in so near a Relation.

A true relation of the manner how it was delivered.
This Petition was subscribed with above 20000 hands of Aldermen,
Common-Counsell men, Merchants, and others of great rank and quality, two
hundred hereof did ride in Coaches, (the II. December. 1641.) to deliver the same.
The House of Commons (after some mediation) admitted their Persons Petition,
which Petition was presented by Mr. Fookes, Merchant, who related to the
Honorable Assembly, that he could have brought them as many persons as there
were hands to the Petition, but that he judged it not fit to come thither in a
tumultous manner; declaring (l^kewise) how they met with some obstructions (in
their ga^^ering of hands) by ill affected persons. And when he had thus done
speaking, they were commanded to withdraw: In the Interim, the Petition was
read in the ^ouse, and then they were called in again: they being come in, the
Honorable Assembly certified unto then that their Petition was very loving and
thank^^lly accepted of with reality of affections, promising them that they
would take the several branches of their Petition into Consideration giving
them order (like^ise) to present the Names of such ill affected Persons, as did
hinder or discourage them in seeking to redress their grievances in so lawful
a way, and a strict order should be taken with them.

Printed in the year 1641.
