ADVICE to the PAINTER, From a Satirical Night-MUSE, FOR Limning to the Life
the Witnesses Against the Right Honorable, Anthony, Earl of Shaftsbury.
PAINTER, Draw near, Draw here the leering Look,
Of the By-got Bloodhounds when they Swore on the Book,
Licking their Lips, and Tantalizing for
More Noble Blood than was the poor Joyners Gore:
Limn to the Life, how looked that Breathing Devil
(Who Damned the Gospel for the grandest Evil)
When Sworn upon it, and the fame Blasphemous Tool,
Would prove, THAT God (by whom he Swore) a Fool:
He Would need to Think so, and God's Book a Fable,
As did the POPE (his Father) Curs'dly Babble;
Least the Book should Curse Him, and God prove so Wise
As to Repay with Wrath his Perjuries:
Next, Limn that Frontless Blade, who Boldly said,
That Hyde, and Hallifax, would see Him paid
Nobly, that Durst this Noble EARL Traduce
With TREASON Home, as if the Old Say, in Use,
From Hell, Hull, Hallifax, He would turn Thus,
From Hell, Hyde, Hallifax, Deliver us:
Surely, those Noble Lords will Vindicate
Their Honors, from his Slanders sublimate:
PAINTER, go on, show Thy Dexterity
In Limning the Rest of that Rascality:
Those Sons of Beli-al, Knights of the Post,
Incarnate Dev'ls, Jesabels Suborned Hoft,
Against our Naboth; To remove that Rub.
Which stops their Running Bowls, their Wits they Club,
Charging this Loyal Lord with Blasphemy
'Gainlt God and King, Treason and Treachery:
PAINT, All those Miscreants, as Belching out
(From their Black Slabering Mouth, and Snotty Snout)
Their Thunder-Thumping Lies, and Oaths so sharp
As would shout through a Marble Wall, Had the Harp
And the Harrow Hanged (their Doom) together Better
They Would pierced our PEER, for Words as well as Letter.
Paint them with Pockets large, well lined with Gold,
(The price of Innocents Blood, Bought and Sold)
Which with its Splendor Dazles Eyes, and which
Mere Mercenary Mortals does Bewitch:
It but one ANGEL could make Balaams Ass
Speak, then what may not Many bring to pass?
Yea, goodly GUINNYS, Double Angels All
And more than so, able to Conjure small,
Yea, and Great Devils up, make ASSES Speak,
And Swear, so far as the Devils Arse in Peak:
As Beelzebuh; that Prince of Hies, them Fly-blows,
Which makes men think, they are all the Devils By-blows.
ONE Swears this EARL aimed to Depose the King,
And Inthrone Buckingham, a likely Thing!
Another Swears, This Earl would Crown Himself,
Yet ALL Deposed, He Is for a COMMONWEALTH:
Lo, the Inconsistency, of the Evidence,
Both with it Self, with Truth and Common Sense,
Like the False VVitnesses against our Lord,
Which could not with Themselves, nor Truth accord.
Confounded Thus, those Babel-builders be,
Their Testimonies plainly Disagree:
If He designed to set up Buckingham,
Then to Inthrone himself must be a Sham;
For a Republic if he did pursue,
Then neitheir of the former can hold True:
Right Babels-Lrats, whose Tongues divided are,
Whose Legs, as well as Language Interfare:
Thus far their Impudence boldly bore-up,
Mark Painter here, what 'twas that made them stoop,
A London Jury's (not like Iezreel,
Which found the Bill through haughty Jezabel
Against Faultless Naboth) Cross-Int'rogatories,
Confound those Pests in their Repugnant Stories.
This VVealthy, Wise, Sagacious JURY well
VVeigh'd every Circumstance. They could not sell
The Life of such a Peerless PEER at th'Rate
Of shabby Shams of Mercenary Fate:
Improbable and Contradicting Things
O'rcrules them, and the IGNORAMUS brings;
Which was Received with most loud Acclamations
Though Lying Thompson calls them Sibilations:
Painter, Draw here the Eel-pye, that ('it is said)
Those VVitnesses at Fountain Tavein had
Sent them, wherein eight Ropes wrapped up like Eels
Were ready there both for their Necks and Heels:
A fit Collation for those Rogues in Grain,
Who Durst the Escutcheon of this Earl so stain.
Draw next, the Court's broke up, and the Evidence
Would Sneak away without the People's Sense,
Had they not feared a Shower of Stones would brain them,
But the Gallows claims its Right, the Sheriff must Man them,
Coaches those Beasts, while he did more than's Due,
Lacqueys this Damn d (his Coach-defiling) Crew,
Conveys them to the Savoy their Sanctuary,
Where their strong Guard's the Red-Coat Soldiery:
There must we leave them Lodged, till Tyburn take them,
With its Tippets, if Gods Grace do still forsake them.
Then turn thy Table Painter, take in time,
Thy liveliest Colors, thy Vermilion prime;
Be brisk to Limn to the Life this Lords Enlargment,
After so many Months of's Tower Confinement:
Were the Bells and Bonfires his Congratulation,
With Shouts at the IGNORAMUS Declaration:
What more would have been for his Welcome Home,
Had not preventing Prudence Timely come:
Disdaining to be Popular. He Will not offend
The Court, or Country, neither Foe nor Friend:
He has enongh, that has but Men's affections,
Without their Bells, Bonfires and Acclamations:
These are but Complemental Things (the Heart is all
To God and Men) and to great Minds but small:
Show, How this Peer is Handed to His House
Whence th'Villains Swore Him, and his Neck to th'Noose:
Once more God brings him off, to's Habitation,
God make him more to save both king and Nation;
Gain the Kings Favor, and Advance His Crown
Sit at His Helm, a Pilot of Renown.
LONDON, Printed for Charles Leigh, 1681.
