SOME Select PSALMS OF DAVID Turned anew into Meter, And Suited to the common
Tunes Sung in Parish-Churches:

With a Divine Pindarique Ode On the Redemption of Man.

By Charles Wormington, Gent.

Dublin, Printed for Matthew Gunn at the Bible and Crown near Essex-Gate, 1697.

TO THE READER.
AMidst the bold Attempts of those who try
To give the Psalms new Turns of Poetry
I, in the Lists, thus venture to rush in;
Not that I think I shall the Laurel win;
Or, in the Front with others, Equal show,
(For ah! too well my want of Skill I know)
But with the Brave, to manifest my Zeal,
And best Affections for Wit's Commonweal;
TO oppose at once my Pen, and tempt my Fate,
With Learned Patrick, Stearne, and artful Tate,
Against the united Force of those who try
TO invade its Province with loose Ribauldry.
Where, while some lofty, some too humble be,
The middle Flight shall be observed by me,
Lest should the Fancy, soaring it too high,
Be undiscerned by every Vulgar Eye;
Or, by too feebly striking on the Ground,
In it is bright native Beauties sullied found.
To raise Devotion then shall be my Aim;
Nor can I want Expression from the Theme,
Whereby each treated Palate may be pleased;
If not too dull, or yet too nicely raised;
Nor grossly prejudiced, by tasting long
The fulsome Mixtures of Lampoon and Song.
For how alas! are all Things now cried down,
That are not luscious made to suit the Town;
Where no loose smutty Jests in view are placed,
To quicken and monopolize the Taste:
For (like the French) tho never so rich or new,
It Is not allowed a Feast without Ragoo.
Yet in each Draught should I so fail of Art,
As not to affect the Soul, engage the Heart;
To mount them Heavenward, with Devotion fired,
From whence our Royal Prophet was inspired,
(As well I may suspect my self I shall)
Who can keep up to the Original?
For it is a Work so exquisitly fine,
None e're can reach it but a Pen Divine.
Some Paraphrase I Will use, but such as may
Not run too far the Saored Text astray:
For such are the stiff Laws of peevish Rhyme,
We must obey, though against Sense a Crime.
Each Art and Science has it proper Dress;
Nor must Majestic Poetry have less:
Soft Turns, illustrious Epithets, and Strains of State,
With crowding Fancies, suitable and great,
Are what on it is Triumphant Measures wait*
But here, my Muse, in a less awful Style,
From such bright Modes of Pomp, retires a while;
She humbly shuns that Luster they would give;
Nor stands she now on her Prerogative:
In plain and easy Terms, Sh' essays to prove
Her highest value for the Vulgar's Love,
And fix their thoughts on nobler things above
Where if I find Success attends her Art,
And by her Charms she' has gained to Heaven their Heart,
I shall not then repent me what I Have done,
But wish in the Good Work, I Would farther gone.

Select PSALMS.
Psalm I.

By such as Wicked are;
Nor stands in Sin confirmed, or has
Possessed the Scorners Chair.

Has placed his sole Delight;
Whereon his grave religious Thoughts
Are fixed both Day and Night.

By a sresh Stream appear;
whose Branche^, pressed with clustered Fruit,
Still crown the smiling Year.
Whose Leaf, whose fair delightful Shade
Shall ever verdant last;
And thus on whatsoever Heaven smiles,
Shall no Misfortunes blast.

Who have their God declined;
They, but as empty Chaff, appear,
That Is scattered by the Wind.

Shall fail, when they have found
They are at length those Joys deprived,
Where with the Just are Crowned.

Thy Eyes still fixed with Care;
Whilst Sinners perish in their Course,
Are plunged into Despair.
Psalm V.

Incline thy ever-gracious Ear;

I humbly will direct my Prayer.

My active Soul still early be;
And unto none for help look up,
Or supplicate on Earth but Thee.

Nor do in wickedness delight;
Neither shall any Evil long
Continue to offend thy sight.

Shall from thy glorious Presence drive;
Nor suffer those before Thee Stand,
Who mischief in their Hearts contrive.

Who pleasure take in spreading Lies;
Nor even they escape, just Lord!
Who bloody Stratagems devise.

To thy bright holy Courts repair;
And with a thankful Heart aloud,
Thy everlasting Love declare.
O Lord, my Guide,
Lest peradventure I should stray;
And to my Foes occasion give
T'entrap me in my' ungarded Way.

Whose wicked Hearts conceive a Wrong;
Who, tho their Lips be smooth as Oil,
Have yet a Poison in their Tongue.

Them in their Villainies surprise;
And unto Condemnation bring,
Who in Rebellion against thee rise.

To Thee their grateful Hearts shall raise;
And for the Kindness Thou have shown,
In Triumph celebrate thy Praise.

Shall, Lord, thy Blessings still descend;
Whom with thy Favor, and thy Love,
Thou do as with a shield defend.
Psalm VI. Being the First of the Penitential Ones.

Tho Chastisements are due;
Nor in thy fiercest Wrath too far
My hateful Crimes pursue.

Thus weakn'd with my Groans)
O let thy Love those Pains allay,
Which run through all my Bones.

Of what is already past;
How long will therefore, mighty Lord!
Thy raging Fury last?

My Soul's offended God;
And for thy Mercies sake lay by
Thy sharp afflicting Rod.

where all things silent be,
who can, dread Lord! thy Praises sing,
Or once remember Thee.

My Body feeble wears;
In Sighs it with the Day consumes;
At Night disolves in Tears.

Thus wasted is my State,
Occasioned even now by those
Who my Destruction wait.

The Lord regards my Cries;

His gracious Ear applys.
Psalm XV.

Within thy Courts abide;
Or on thy ever-sacred Mount,
With thy blessed Saints reside.

Whose Feet uprightly tread;
Nor is, through Fear to speak the Truth.
Against his Conscience led.

Or done his Neighbor wrong;
Nor vile Detraction e're has made
The Employment of his Tongue.

Contemns, and only those,
Who fear the Lord, and act what is just,
Respect and Honor shows,
Who never equivocates, or does
Of Falsities allow;
Nor yet, though to his Loss it proves,
E're violates his Vow.

What e're he lends the Poor;
Nor to commit Things base, is One
Whom glittering Bribes allure.
This is, O Lord, that happy Man
Who on thy Hill shall rest;
Unshaken through thy Favor stand,
Shall be for ever blessed.
Psalm. XXX.

My Soul lift up her voice;
Who over me have not made my Foes
In Triumph to rejoice.

Thy Mercy did not sail;
But, as a kind Physician, Thou
Did my Distempers heal.

For happier Ends reserved;
And from the dark forgetful Grave
My sinking Soul preserved.

In Hymns your Loves express;
And let it in Remembrance be,
Of his bright Holiness.

We scarce his Kindness miss;
And in whose Favor lies contained
The Soul's eternal Bliss.
Tho Sorrow for a Night may last,
And we afflicted mourn;
Yet soon with the next Morning's Light.
Our absent Joys return.

Enjoyed my worldly All;
Thus I, o Lord, began to boast,
That I should never fall.

Thy Favors did revoke;
I to my Cost was then convinced
How foolishly I spoke.

I flew for timely Aid;
And thus before thy Majesty,
My Case right humbly laid.

Should it thy Wrath appease?
"How shall the Dust, most mighty Lord!
Thy Excellencies Praise?

Bow down thy gracious Ear;
"Be Thou alone my blessed Support,
Remove my present Fear.

My gloomy Sorrows turned;
And thou, my God, being reconciled,
My Soul no longer mourned.
Psalm XXXII. Being the Second of the Penitential Ones.

Beholdest from above;
Whose Faults thy Justice have escaped,
Are covered by thy Love.

That happy Person Style;
To whom the Lord imputes no Sin,
In whom there is no Guile.

Had not my Crimes confessed:
How strongly was, O Lord, my Mind
With Terrors then possesst?

My Sins did then inflame;
That soon, like Earth in Summer parched,
My wasted Flesh became.

A just Confession made;
How ready were Thou to forgive,
And was thy Wrath allayed!

Who does his Sins forsake,
Thy timely Mercy find, nor shall
The Floods his Soul ore-take.

Art still a sure Defense;
Whom therefore in my Songs I Will praise
For my Deliverance.

Come now and learn of me;
I will direct you in your Course,
Your skilful Pilot be.

Or like an untamed Horse;
Whose headstrong Tempers will not brook
The Curb of Reasons Force.

Who are so brutish found;
But they, who Thee obey, shall be
With thy chief Blessings crowned.

In Triumph praise his Name;
And let such Exultations still
Your fervent Loves proclaim.
Psalm XXXVIII. Being the Third of the Penitential Ones.

Too far my heinous Sins pursue;
Nor on me in thy Wrath inflict
Those sharper Judgments that are due.

Through wilful Breach of Thy Command;
That almost crushed to Death I lie
Beneath the Pressure of thy Hand.

Such has thy late Displeasure been;
Nor even Rest unto my Bones,
By reason of my raging Sin.

So dreadful is my present Fear;
That sunk beneath them, Lord, I can
Their heavy weight no longer bear.

Thus for my Wickedness I pay:

As one in Mourning spend the Day.

Raised, Lord, by thy correcting Hand;
My Friends even shun me as a Plague,
And at a distance gazing stand.

As silent too, as one that is dumb,
I open not, O Lord, my mouth,


On whom with Patience I thus wait:
And sure I am, Thou, Lord, wilt hear
The Cries of my afflicted State.

My weak and needy State look on;
For Thou alone art my Support!
My Comfort! my Salvation!
Psalm XLII.

Would at the Waters be;
With such Desire, o Lord, inflamed,
My Soul pants after Thee.

With fervent Passion burn;
Expecting when to thy loved Courts,
I shall again return.

While Men thus me upbraid;
And in a Scoff cry, where is thy God?
Where Is now thy boasted Aid?

To think on those blessed Days,
When thronged, I to the Temple went
To celebrate thy Praise.

And are thy Joys allayed?
O! why is now, my better Part,
Become at length dismayed?
God still is thy Support, in whom
Fail not thy Trust to place;
For lo! his Name thou yet shall praise,
For his Returns of Grace.
Psalm Li. Being the Fourth of the Penitential Ones.

My guilty State survey;
And of thy never-failing Love,
Wipe all my Sins away.

from each offensive Stain;
That ^n thy Presence, Lord, it may
Appear for ever clean.

I will my Crimes confess:
Who* Day and Night still haunted am,
With my foul Wickedness.

Even I, who am but Dust,
And should I be condemned, yet Thou
Remainst for ever just.

A wretched Compound made;
In Sin my Mother brought me forth,
In Sin I was conceived.

O righteous God! we find,
Than in Man's inward Purity,
His Uprightness of Mind.

I shall unspotten show;
Correct in all my inner Parts,
And be more white than Snow.

Resume her tuneful Voice;
And even all my shattered Bones,
In God their Strength Rejoice.
Psalm LXVII.

The People who be thine;
And through their gloomy Nature let
Thy radiant Beauty shine.

Where such thy Mercies flow,
May, through the Brightness of thy Face,
Their great Salvation know.

Their holy joys proclaim;
And in exalted Hymns of Praise
Set forth thy Glorious Name.

Thy lasting Goodness Sing;
Who art their Righteous Governor!
Their Lord! their mighty King!

Their holy Joys proclaim;
And in exalted Hymns of Praise
Set forth thy glorious Name.

Be crowned with lasting Peace;
And, of those Blessings Thou have sown,
Send forth a large Increase.

Thy Majesty declare;
Whilst the astonished world, Great God!
Thy' Almightiness shall fear.
Psalm LXVII. Another Meter.

The People who be Thine;
And through their gloomy Nature let
Thy radiant Beauty shine.

Where such thy Mercies flow,
May through the Brightness of thy Face,
Their great salvation know.

Their holy joys proclaim?
And in exal^ed Hymns of Praise
Set forth thy glorious Name.

Thy lasting Goodness sing;
Who art their righteous Governor!
Their Lord! their mighty King!

Their holy Joys proclaim;
And in exalted Hymns of Praise
Set forth thy glorious Name.

Be crowned with lasting Peace;
And of those Blessings Thou have sown,
Send forth a large Increase.

Thy Majesty declare,
Whilst the astonished World, Great God!
Thy' Almightiness shall fear.
Psalm LXXXII.

Ye Pillars of the Land,
God does with an inspecting Eye,
Amidst your Councels stand!

Neglect what is just to do;
And only to the Rich, the Great,
Your partial Favors show?

On Seats of Justice sit;
Should with unbiased Minds still act
in the Defense of it.

Are in the Balance laid;
How are the Earth's Foundations shook!
How light is Justice made!

But know, that ye shall all

Shall with the Sinful fall.

And let thy Power be known;
That Thou may Mankind vindicate,
Who are by right thy own.
Psalm XC.

Our wonted Place of Rest;
In whom we have Protection found,
By whom we have been blessed.

With Majesty aray'd,
E're yet the Mountains were brought forth,
Or the round World was made.

And therefore lo! we must,
When Thou art pleased to speak the Word,
Return again to Dust.

When measured by thine Eye:
They all are but as Yesterday;
As swift as Thought they fly.

Even like a Dream we pass;

At Noon like withered Grass.

Through thy consuming Ire;
Who just^y for our Sins are plagued,
And suddenly expire.

Our wickednesses lie;
And even our most sec^e^ Crimes,
As Day before thine Bye.

Our Life more short appears;
And as an empty Tale that is told,
Pass off our rolling Years.

Yet here should we below
To eighty Years through Strength arrive,
We then but Sorrows know.
At most it is (o Lord) but short,
And in a Breath gone over;
So soon like fading Plants we fall,
And then are seen no more.
Psalm XCV.

In Songs our Voices raise;
For He our great Salvation is,
And best deserves our Praise.

And Hearts prepared, let us go;
That we in a triumphant Mirth,
Our Gratitude may show.

From whom all Beings spring;
Who is of Powers above, below,
The overruling King.

Whose Sway no Limits knows;

The Ocean ebbs and flows.

Possessed with holy Fear;
And that bright Majesty address,
By whom alone we are.

Through whom we nothing need;
We are his Sheep, our Shepherd He,
By whom we safely feed.

His lasting Love possess;
Let not your Sins his Wrath provoke,
As in the Wilderness.

He did their Hopes destroy,

should never his Rest enjoy.
Psalm C.

And, that ye now your Love may show;

Your grateful Songs of Praises flow.

By whom, not by our selves, we are made;
We are his People, and as Sheep
He gently does in Pastures lead.

Within his Courts your Joys proclaim;
Be ever thankful for his Love.
Extol his ever-sacred Name.

Whose Mercies everlasting prove;
Who in the eternal Circle reigns,
Of never-weaning Truth and Love.
Psalm CII. Being the Fifth of the Penitential Ones.

Thy ever-gracious Ear apply:

When in Distress to Thee I cry.

My Bones are burnt even as an Hearth;
Which are, O God, the dire Effects,
The Marks of thy enkindl'd Wrath.

No Food my fainting Spirits chears;
Whilst lo! through want of such Support,
My Heart like withered Grass appears.

Do even cleave my aching Bones;
And that by reason of my Plaints,
My never-ceasing Sighs and Groans.

Such is, O Lord, my deep Distress;
I Am as the Pelican become,
The Screech-Owl of the Wilderness.

I watch, and am alone all Day;

On me their vile Reproaches lay.

With Tears I mingle still my Drink;

My weak and drooping Spirits sink.

Does as an empty Shadow pass;
And even I, in nature, am
No better than the fading Grass.

In Mercy shine, and be the same;
Whilst Ages yet to come, shall praise,
Shall magnify thy glorious Name.
Psalm CXVI.

Is fixed my sole delight;
Who did not in my ^ate Distress
My Supplications slight.

I Will therefore not delay,
But, whilst I Have yet to live, proceed
Still fervently to pray.

And threatened naught but Hell;
'Twas Thee, O Lord, whom I then found
My Rock, my Citadel.

Who did the Foe control;
And from invading Miseries
Thus save my sinking Soul.

Most merciful! and kind!
And who to all a Refuge art,
Who would a Refuge find.

Art still a sure Relief;
For such I found Thee, o my God!
When I was in my Grief.

To my Redeemer make;
Who thus of my expiring Soul
Did so much Pity take.

Wherein Salvation lies;
And in Return thereof give up
My Heart a Sacrifice.

My holy Vows will pay;
And to the Lord my Praises date,
From this most happy Day.
Psalm CXXX. Being the Sixth of the Penitential Ones.

I Have now sent up my Cry;

Thy gracious Ear apply.

Too strict Account demand,
Who can before Thee, Lord, appear!
Who can unpunished stand!

Thy Mercy still the same;
That the repenting World from thence,
May learn to fear thy Name.
Israel therefore trust,
Whose Mercies do abound;

Who is our Ransom found.
Psalm CXXXIII.

The Brethren live in Unity!

On thy great Sacrificer's Head;
Which down the holy Robe distilled,
And with rich Scents its Borders filled;

On Sion's sacred Mountain-Tops:
Even so, o Lord, does here below,
On all the Saints, thy Blessings flow;
Who, to resemble those above,
United are in Peace and Love.
Doxologie.
Glory be to the Father, Son,
And Holy Ghost, the Great Three-One;
Which ever was, is now, shall be
Ascribed to all Eternity.
Psalm. CXXXIV.

Ye who by Night resort,
And to your God Attendance pay
Within his holy Court.

Your Thanks aloud proclaim;
With grateful Hearts and Hands erect,
O praise God's holy Name.

His faithful People bless;
Sion shall even then be crowned
With lasting Happiness.
Psalm CXXXVII.
Euphrates Streams,
Were as sad Captives sat,
Far distant from our Native Soil,
Bemoaning of our Fate.
It was for Thee, we (Sion) did
In Tears our Loves express;
And all those dear Remembrances
Of thy past Happiness.

Our silent Harps were laid;
Which Sympathising with our Griefs,
No cheerful Music made.
O here, an Hebrew Song,
With an insulting Air,
They haughtily did then demand,
To whom we Prisoners were.

Tune now to Sorrows Strains;
Or sing the Praises of our God,
Where a strange Monarch reigns.
Jerusalem! if e're
My Thoughts of Thee decay,
May on the warbling Harp, my hand
Forget her wonted Play.

For ever silent be;
Even now, before my chiefest Mirth,
If I prefer not Thee.

Who on the Attaque were found,
Thus of Jerusalem to say;
O raze it to the Ground!
Babylon! behold,
Is thy approaching Fate;
And unlamented Miseries
Of thy declining State.

Who lays thy Feet in Chains;
And in that day, against thy proud Walls,
shall dash thy Childrens Brains.
Psalm CXLI.

And on thy Mercy do rely;
Reject not then my humble Suit,
When in my Wants to Thee I cry.
O let my Prayer before Thee come,
Like Smoke of Incense let it rise;
That my prepared Devotions may
Be as an Evening Sacrifice.

To keep thy Servant still in Fear;
That nothing from my Lips may pass,
Which may offend thy Sacred Ear.
O let not, Lord,
My weak unguarded Heart incline;
Lest with the Ungodly in their Ways,
I may unhappily combine.

Reproved by those who Friendly Love;
For that unto my wounded Head
Will a balsamic Ointment prove.

Of their own Wickedness shall reap;
Let me, through thy ne're-failing Love,
Their evil Machinations 'scape.
Psalm CXLIII. Being the Seventh and last of the Penitential Ones.

Which I now make to Thee;
And in thy everlasting Truth
Fail not to answer me.

Too strict Account demand;
For sure I am, none justisy'd,
Shall in thy Presence stand.

Even such has been my Dread,
That in the Dark I Have lain concealed,
As one that has been dead.

Which from my Fears ^rise,
My Heart grows desolate, my Soul
Immersed in Sorrow lies.

Thy Works recall to Mind;
Nor are, my God! those Days forgot
Wherein thou have been kind.

More languishingly wait,
Than thirsty Earth for Showers of Rain,
That Is parched with Summer's Heat.

Thy Presence let me have;
Lest I become like those who lie
In the neglected Grave.

Thy wonted Kindness meet;
And in the way that I should walk,
Guide Thou my erring Feet.

And would my Life surprise,
Do Thou thy Servant now protect
Who to thy Shelter flies.
O teach me, Thou that art my God,
Thy Sacred Laws to obey;
And to the Land of Righteousness
My Soul at length convey.
Psalm CXLV.
O eternal God!
I will thy Praises sing;

The everlasting King!

O brightest Excellence!
Whose Power is beyond a Bound,
Whose Goodness is Immense.

Thy Works to sing, proceeds;
And to the astonished World around,
Repeats thy mighty Deeds.

Thy Glory to relate;
And in exalted Hymns display
Thy bright Majestic State.

Thy Greatness to express;
And be with Reverence informed,
Of thy Almightiness.

They have Thy Favors found;
And where Thy Justice should have reached,
Thy Love did most abound.

No other Cares confine;
But still over all thy Work alike,
Thy tender Mercies shine.

We will our Th^nks proclaim;
And, as it best becomes thy Saints,
Extol thy sacred Name.
Psalm CL.

Where his bright Honor's known
O let to God your Praises be
In Hallelujahs shown.

Let Instruments express
Those lofty Joys, which best may Suit
With his Almightiness.

The Trumpet sound his Praise;
And the soft Strains o'th warbling Lute
Your best Affections raise.

His Holiness advance;
O praise him on the high-ton'd Pipes,
O praise him in the Dance.

Your Solemn Thanks resound;
That your Devotions still may be
With choicest Music crowned.

Their mighty Lord proclaim;
Let Heaven and Earth in Consort join,
To Praise His Holy Name.
A DIVINE Pindarique ODE, ON The Redemption of Man.

FITTED To the Holy Times OF ADVENT and LENT.

ODE. ON The Redemption of Man.
I.
AWake! awake! o my Lethargick Soul!
And off, Sin's weighty Fetters, shake;
Let not the Tyrant thus control,
And thee its Slave, its boasted Captive make:
But rise, and here o let thy unvailed Eye
Survey a new thy glorious Liberty.
Lo! where the long expected Day appears,
And the bright Sun its western Journey steers,
The Day! which now of lasting Peace the joyful Tidings bears!
Hail sacred Morn! and Thou more sacred Light!
Who thus with evangelick Rays
Inform'st our darkened Sight,
Inform'st our erring VVays.
Long in Egyptian Darkness have we lain,
(Like those unhappy and benighted Souls,
Who wandering live beneath the Shady Poles)
Not knowing how, alas! or where,
(Whilst naught, but Nature's Twilight did remain,
Which gave but a dim Prospect of our future State)
In this wild Maze our doubtful course to steer,
Or counter-trace the strict Decree of Fate.
II.
BUt, Happy Soul! no more shall dread Despair,
Nor all the Powers of Hell, or Darkness there,
O're-spread the Brightness of thy Hemisphere,
Since from on high the Dayspring now descends,
And on this lower World it is Glory bends;
Since the great Will of the Jehovah's known
By the stupendous Message of his Son,
And all those blessed Effects which did depend thereon.
Death even now, by an eternal Doom,
Is but the Effigies of Sleep become;
Humanity's last cheerful Stage from this,
To that bright World of never-fading Bliss;
Where with our Souls, our Bodies are to be,
From all their gross Impuritie,
Refined into a glorious Immortality:
O blessed Inversion of our wretched State,
And all those miserable Consequences which on it did wait!
III.
COme then, my Soul, and be no longer mute,
But rise, and take thy well strung Lute,
Set to thy Heart,
With nicest Ear, and strictest Art;
And with the Lark, thy morning Hymns prepare,
Who now begins to mount the Air,
To chant her early Matins there.
O come, and with her bear a Part;
Raise up the Strings, raise up thy Heart,
And to the sacred undivided Three
Make thou thy due Return of Praise
In hallowed Lays.
Let Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be
The divine Gam'ut of thy Harmony.
In those three ever-sacred Notes, o let
Thy grateful Airs still move, thy Hymns be set,
Until at length in that bright Quire above
(Where reigns eternal Music, endless Love)
They shall b' inspired beyond all studious Pains,
With far more lasting, more seraphick strains.
IV.
SHall every Creature, every living Thing,
Prepare to celebrate the approaching Spring,
And to their great Creator their due Praises bring;
Shall the sweet Birds together now repair,
And with their rural Anthems fill the Air,
To welcome in the newborn Year;
Shall even Nature from Earth's naked Bed,
Wherein she seemed so long to have lain dead,
Unfold anew her Treasures, and arise
With all her pompous Train of Liveries,
To pay her God her annual Sacrifice.
Shall every Creature thus, ah! thus put on
A cheerful Look to meet th'advancing Sun;
And shall not thou, my Soul, my better Part,
From cursed Estate redeemed, with thankful Heart,
Join in the grateful Consort, and present
Thy consecrated Instrument;
That Instrument, which lay so long untuned, and out of date,
As if it had bemoaned thy unreversed Fate.
For shame for shame, strike the prepared String,
Till it is in tune with Nature found,
Till with thy Praises thou have made it sound,
And be not Thou the only silent thing.
V.
GLory be therefore to the great Three-One
The Eather, Holy Spirit, and the Son,
Who Sit with equal Power on the eternal Throne.
Glory and Praise be ever to the Lamb;
Heaven's mighty Darling, and the Soul's Desire,
Th'incessant Song of the Seraphick Quire:
Who, from the Bosom of his Father, came,
Did from his Majesty a while retire,
That he might here to wretched Mankind prove
Those long expected Blessings of his Love:
Who was e're yet the World's vast Frame was laid;
Who for Time's Fullness only stayed,
E're the' important Embassy he made.
O may I thus for ever be
(Mysterious undivided Three!)
Employed in praising, in admiring Thee.
May all things both in Heaven and Earth,
Which now have either Life or Breath;
Which either on the Ground do creep,
Or in the Seas, or Waters keep;
Which either in the Air do fly,
Or in the higher Regions ly;
Which in the heavenly Quire are placed,
And with thy glorious Presence graced;
For ever here below, and there above,
In holy and exalted Mirth,
Set forth thy universal Love,
Till the whole Round of Heaven and Earth,
By their according Notes, shall ring
With the loud Praises of the eternal King.
VI.
O The stupendous State of restored Man!
Which stinted Reason cannot scan;
Nor all the Power of vain Philosophy define,
What is so far beyond the Reach of it is short Sounding-Line!
What could have so engaged the Deity,
(O wondrous Riddle of Divinity!)
Thus to contract Immensity?
And in our narrow Nature, to descend
At once a God offended, and a Friend,
Stripped of his brightest Glories from above,
Where in full Luster He enthroned had fat,
The all-wise Dictator of the Immortal State;
Heaven's mighty Monarch of eternal Date!
And by a new grand Charter in his Blood,
To make us, of his Kingdom, free,
(Which we in Sin so long before with-stood)
And give us there again a Property,
But the soft Dictates of Paternal Love?
VII.
'TWas Thou alone, the sweetning Atribute!
To whom we daily make our humble suit
Thou, who to every Creature do dispense
Thy free and gentle Influence;
'Twas Thou that did perform what was so long foretold,
In misty Prophecies of old;
And did, by thy prevailing Power,
Lapst Man again to Liberty restore,
And all he lost by Eden's Sin before.
Thou, matchless Love! were the magnetic Spell,
Which wrought the amazing Miracle,
And thus defeated the Designs of Hell.
Naught could divert thy penetracting Force,
Or stop the Stream of thy unbounded Course.
For ah! offended Love!
When from above
My naked Sins did for thy Vengeance call,
At my presumptuous disobedient Fall;
Even when Justice had unsheathed her Sword,
And waited only for the fatal Word,
It Was then that Thou, thy Mighty Self to show,
Did step between, and on thy Side receive the direful Blow.
VIII.
LO! to you sacred Hill direct thine Eye,
The Theater of Woe, Mount Calvary;
Where Death in all her pompous Horror sits,
And issues out her fatal Writs;
Where She her utmost Empire does display,
And though for ever vanquished, wins the Day:
There, o my Soul, thou may at large descry
In Scenes of Blood the Holy Tragedy.
Lo! where a gathering Stormy Mob appears,
And by their boisterous Cries untune the Spheres
Naught through the Throng is heard, but Crucify;
And it is concluded the great Son of God must dye;
Not to atone their Sins, but satisfy their Lust,
the Bent of their remorseless Cruelty:
Whilst He alas! continues still to appear
All Love, and while They now his lingering Death prepare,
The giddy Deed forgives --
And to his enraged Fathers Ear
Breaths forth their Pardon with his dying Prayer:
Whilst the astonished Sun with-draws its Light,
And Nature sickens at the dreadful Sight.

SInce then the Christian Harvest is so near,
And Grace and Mercy do so ripe appear,
Be active, o my Soul! in this thy Day;
Bind up thy Sheaves, and come away,
And on the holy Altar lay
The Offering of thy First Fruits,
Which with thy happy Circumstances Suits;
For look, whereon already lies,
To turn 't into an acceptable Sacrifice,
God's all enflaming Love,
Descending from above,
Where with the nimble Sparks thy ravished
Thoughts may fly
To that blessed Place beyond the Sky,
(Where heretofore in bright Celestial Fire
The holy Prophet did from hence retire)
And there for ever reap thy Joy, thy long Desire.

BUt hold --
Thy officious haste thou may, my Soul! forbear;
Nor thy Oblations now prepare,
Those empty Types of what is already here.
For on the gory Altar lo! where lies,
The God of Love, whose self a bleeding dies,
And for thy Sins becomes both Priest and Sacrifice.
O dreadful, but yet happy Sight!
From whence alone the feeble Soul takes Flight,
Mounts on the Wings of Faith and soars aright.
Thither, with Joy, come then prepare to fly,
(My panting Soul!)
And in those warm balsamic Streams which glide.
So freely there from his deep wounded Side,
Go bathe thy long contracted Leprosy;
That Leprosy alas! of thy old Sin and Shame,
Which from the Surfit of thy Parents came.
Thither, I say, o thither fly with speed,
Where the Soul's blessed Bethesda stands indeed!
That sacred Pool, from whose eternal Source,
All healing Virtues have their proper Course;
Where Purple Streams make glad the barren Soil
With an Increase beyond the Laborer's Toil;
Where Tides of Blessings do for ever flow,
And 'round whose Borders Peace and Pleasure grow;
Where all, who are diseased, may freely come,
And without Price or Trouble now have Room;
Where, once the Heart is stirred by Faith and Love,
There needs no waiting 'till it is Waters move;
But where the Halt the Infected and the Blind,
And all that enter with a willing Mind,
Their everlasting Cures may surely find.
FINIS.
