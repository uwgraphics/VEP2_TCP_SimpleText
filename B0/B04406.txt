A most Excellent Ballad of an Old man and his Wife: Who in their great want
and misery sought to their Children for succor, by whom they were disdained,
and scornfully sent them away succourless, and Gods vengeance showed on them
for the same.
The tune is, Priscilla,






I^ was an old man with his poor wife
in great distress did fall,
They were so feeble with age ^ol ^ol
they could not work at all:
A gallant So^ they had,
which lived wealthily,
To him they went with a full intent
to ease their misery
Alack and alas for woe.
A hundred miles when they had gone,
with many a weary step,
At length they saw their Sons fair house
which made their hearts to leap:
They fate them on the Green
their Nose and Shoos to trim,
They put their hands about their necks,
against they should enter in.
Alack etc.
Unto the Door with trembling Joints
When these Old couple came,
The Woman with a shaking hand,
the Old man blind and lame.
(...)ly they knocked,
s(...) offend,
At (...) frowningly came,
u(...) in the end,
Alack etc.
Good folks quoth. he what would you have?
methinks you are too bold,
Why get you not home to your own country
now you are lame and old?
With that they both replied,
with sorrow, care and grief,
Here are we come to thee our Son
for succor and relief.
Alack etc.
This is thy Father gentle Son,
and I thy loving Mother,
That brought the up so tenderly,
and loved thee above all other:
I bore thee in this womb,
these breasts did nourish thee,
And as it chanced, I often danced
thee on my tender knee,
Alack etc.
And humbly now we thee entreat
our dear and loving Son,
That you will do for us in our age,
as we for you have done:
Now nay not so he said,
your suit is all in vain,
It Is best for you I tell you true
to get you home again,
Alack etc.




THe worlds not now as when I was born
al things are grown more dear,
My charge of Children likewise is great,
as plainly does appear:
The best that I can do
will hardly them maintain,
Therefore I say be packing away,
and get thee home again.
Alack and alas for woe.
The Old m^n with his hat in hand,
full many a Leg did make,
The Woman wept and wrong her hands,
and prayed for Christ his sake:
Not so to send them back,
distressed and undone,
But let us lie in some Barn here by,
quoth she my loving Son.
Alack etc.
By no means he would thereto consent,
but sent them soon away,
Quoth he you know the parill of the Law,
if long time here you stay:
The Stocks and the Whipping-Post
shall fall unto your share,
Then take you heed, and with all speed
to your Country repair.
Alack. etc.
Away then went this woeful Old Man,
full sad in heart and mind,
With weeping tears his Wife did lament,
their Son was so unkind:
Thou wicked wretch quoth they,
for this thy cruel deed,
The Lord send the as little pity
when thou do stand in need.
Alack. etc.
His Children hearing their Father set
his Parents thus at naught,
In short time after to have his Land
his death by subtle wrought:
What cause have we quoth they
more kindness to express,
Then he unto his Parents did,
in their great wretchedness.
Alack etc.
They murdered him in piteous sort,
they weig'd not his entreats,
The more he prayed compassionately,
the greater were his threats:
Speak not to us, quoth they,
for thou the death shall dye,
And with that word with a Dagger and sword
they mangled him monstrously.
Alack, etc.
When they had got his Silver and Gold,
according to their mind,
They buried him in a stinking Ditch,
where no man should him find:
But now hebold and see
Gods vengeance on them all,
To gain their Gold their Cousin came
and flew them great and small.
Alack, etc.
He came among them with great Club^
in dead time of the night,
Yea two of the Sons he brained there with,
and taking of his flight,
The Murderer takes was,
and suffered for the sa^,
Deserved for that cruelty,
this vengeance upon them came,
Alack and alas therefore,
Alack and alas therefore.
