royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE
The Kings Majesty's speech, in the Parliament at Edinburgh the seventeenth day
of August, 1641.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THere has nothing been so displeasing to me as those unlucky differences
which of late have happened betwixt me, and my Subjects, and nothing that I
have more desired, as to see this day, wherein I hope not only to setle these
unhappy mistakings, but rightly to know, and to be known of my native country.
I need not tell you (for I think it is well known to most) what difficulties I
have passed by, and overcome to be here at this time, yet this I will say, that
if love to my native country, had not been a chief motive to this journey,
other respects might easily have found a shift to do that by a commissioner,
which I am come to perform my self. All this considered, I cannot doubt but to
find such real Testimonies of your affections, for the maintenance of that
royal power which I enjoy after 108 descents, and which you have so often
prosessed to maintain, and to which your own national oath does oblige you,
that I shall not think my pains ill bestowed. Now the end of my coming is
shortly this, to perfect whatsoever I have promised, and withal to quiet those
distractions which have, and may fall out amongst you, and this I mind not
superficially, but fully and cheerfully to do, for I assure you that I can do
nothing with more cheerfulness then to give my people a general satisfaction,
Wherefore not offering to indeere my self to you in words (which indeed is not
my way) I desire in the first place to settle that which concerns the religion
and just liberties of this my native Country before I proceed to any other Act.
