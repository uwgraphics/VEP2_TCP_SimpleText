Loves Paradise.
Showing the admirable felicity that true-Lovers enjoy in the chaste embraces
of their dearest Loves, as this following example does declare.
To the tune of Fancies Phoenix
by J. P.


ALL in a pleasant shady grove
as I was passing time away,
I chanced to see the God of Love
with Bow and Quiver, sport and play;
At random he did shoot his darts
to wound poor lovers tender hearts.
But passing forward in a trice,
I came to True-Loves Paradise.
With admiration I beheld
the beauty of so sweet a place,
All earthly pleasures it does yield
to them which do true love embrace,
For all delights no place so rare
with this Elysium may compare.
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
The Arbours stand in rich array,
and gloriously appear in sight.
Bedecked with Flowers and Garlands gay,
with Roses, Damask, Red and White,
The murmuring springs do make a noise
for to complete true Lovers joys;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
To see the Lovers arm in arm,
how they together walk and prate,
Free from all danger, dread and harm,
each one enjoyes his loving Mate,
O happy thrice, dear souls they be
always in such sweet company;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
Their chaste embraces are so sweet,
and all their actions innocent
When ever their sweet lips do meet
a Message to the heart is sent,
To stir affection chaste and pure,
which shall perpetually endure,
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
Their joys abounded more and more
to hear the birds so sweetly sing,
I never heard the like before,
they made the Grove with Echoes ring,
Thrice happy they, that have their choice
of this, or that mellodious voice;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
The second part,
to the same Tune,




I Sat me on a flowery hill,
near to an Arbor fresh and green,
Where fair Lucina mourned her fill,
thinking she was not heard, nor seen,
'Twas for the absence of her dear
that she did thus lament and fear.
Then lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
Shall I lament and mourn alone,
whilst other Lovers do rejoice,
O whither is my True-Love gone
that I cannot hear his sweet voice,
It would revive my Love-sick-heart,
and force all sorrows to depart;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
Some strange disaster does detain,
my dearest love from me this time,
I Am sure he constant will remain,
his love is fixed and so is mine,
O why do I thus pine away
since long from me he cannot stay?
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
It grieved my heart, her plaint to hear
how she did sigh and make her moan,
At length her Lover did appear,
then all her grief was fled and gone,
With great delight they did embrace
when they beheld each others face;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
Dear heart quoth he, I have concealed
my self a while to hear thy plaint,
But since thy love thou have revealed
I Will n'ere adore another Saint,
Take hand and heart, and all that is mine,
for thou may freely call me thine;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
When they had joined two hearts in one,
with true affection in each breast,
They could no longer stay alone,
but walked out amongst the rest
With hand in hand 'twas rare to see,
how mutually they all agree;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
In pleasures rare they pass the time,
in choice delights and harmless sport,
The Summer it was in the prime,
when as these Lovers did resort,
The warbling quire their senses cheered
enough to ravish all that heard;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
How happy are those Lovers true,
that do enjoy such perfect bliss,
He that Loves Paradise will view,
may taste of such delight as this,
But he that does unconstant prove.
shall never know the sweets of Love;
Then Lovers all take my advice,
and hasten to Loves Paradise.
Finis.
