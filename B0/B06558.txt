The King and Kingdoms joyful Day of Triumph.
OR, The Kings most Excellent Majesty's Royal and Triumphant coming to London,
accompanied by the ever Renowned, his Excellency the Lord General Monck, and an
numerous company of his Royal Peers, Lords, Knights, Citizens, and Gentry, who
conducted his Royal Majesty in Honor and Triumph from Dover to London.

To the Tune of, The Scottish Lady, or, Ill tide that cruel peace that gained a
War on one.


KIng Charles he now in Landed,
to ease his Subjects moan;
Those that are faithful handed
he takes them for his own:
Oh he is our Royal Sovereign King,
And is of the Royallest Off spring,
Peace and plenty with him he will bring,
And will set us free
from all vexations,
and great taxations,
woe and misery,
And govern all these Nations
with great tranquillity.
Lord General of fair England
marched forth to meet the King,
To entertain him when he did Land,
and to London him did bring;
He is the worthy Man of Might
That does both King and Country right,
In whom God and man takes delight:
For surely he
well does understand
what he does take in hand;
and most discreetly
He does his warlike Troops commmand,
renowned to Posterity.
The Trumpets bravely sounded,
the Kings Return again.
With joy their hearts abounded
the King to entertain:
Aloud they sounded forth his praise,
Englands Glory for to raise;
For God is just in his ways
Assuredly:
most hearts then were glad,
no man seeming sad,
the bravest day that ever came,
We happy by our King are made,
to his eternal fame,
The Citizens of London
with a most pompous Train,
For evermore has praise wone,
his favor for to gain,
Gallantly marched out of the Town
To King Charles's Royal Renown,
In peace to bring him to the Crown
Richly attired:
by the Lords persuasion
after the richest fashion
greatly admired;
The chiefest in this Nation,
whose hearts with joy are fired.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.




THen many brave Noblemen
All most gallant and brave,
Marched out of the Town then;
both valiant, wise, and grave,
Counting it a most delightful thing
For to honor Charles our Royal King,
And to the Crown him in peace to bring:
desiring he
now might be Crowned,
and still Renowned
to posterity,
On whom fortune had frowned
for his sincerity.
Many thousands of Horsemen,
then marched over the Plain,
For to defend King Charles then,
and him to entertain:
Their Horses went prancing along,
When they were the rest among,
And seemed to dance amidst the Throng
So merrily;
seeming to be glad,
they that journey had:
they ma^cht on most,
They were neither heavy nor sad,
but went delightfully.
Their Riders richly tired
in costly Cloth of Gold,
Their journey so required,
most rich for to behold:
Oh it was the most glorious sight,
And did my heart so much delight,
That I could not forbear but write.
They were such gallant Blades,
and so richly dressed,
as cannot be expressed,
they were most bonny Lads,
All malice they did d^test,
they were such brave Comrades.
Each Regiment from other
known by their several notes,
As plainly it did appear,
and was all in Buff-Coats:
And in silken Scarfs all of green,
With Hats and Feathers to be seen,
Most rich as well I ween,
Were these brave men:
England did never
see the like ever
but may again
They marched most courageous,
the King to entertain
And this does these Lands rejoice,
and all that in them live,
Even both with hearts and voice,
and thanks to God do give,
Which restored unto us our King,
And Usurpers down did fling:
Freedom unto us to bring;
We shall be free
from all Exilements
and ill Revilements,
we and our posterity
Shall have our full enjoyments,
and happy days shall see.
