BY THE Lord Lieutenant AND COUNCIL.
ESSEX.
WHEREAS in an Act of Parliament, lately passed in this Kingdom, Entitled, An
ACT for the Explaining of some Doubts, arising upon an ACT, Entitled, an ACT,
for the better Execution of His MAJESTY'S Gracious Declaration, for the
Settlement of His Kingdom of Ireland, and satisfaction of the several Interests
of Adventurers, Soldiers, and other His Subjects there, and for making some
alterations of, and additions unto the said ACT, for the more speedy and
effectual Settlement of the said Kingdom, There is one Clause contained in
these words following.

And for the better carrying on of this present Settlement, by raising such a
sum of Money, as may be sufficient to buy off several Estates and Interests,
which by virtue of the said former ACT are now in being, and if they should be
strictly challenged and demanded, according to the Tenor of the said ACT,
would in a great measure delay and hinder the Execution of this present ACT. Be
it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That one Years Rent of all the
Lands in Ireland, which were returned by the Civil Survey, to belong to any
Irish Papist, Popish Recusant or Roman Catholic, according to the Values the
same Lands were let at, in the year One Thousand six Hundred fifty and nine,
and of all other the Lands wherein any Adventurer, or Soldier, his Heirs,
Executors or Assigns, has any benefit of Settlement or Confirmation by virtue
of this present ACT, (the Lands Settled by Erasmus Smith, to any pious or
charitable use only excepted) be forthwith raised and paid unto the Receivers
herein after constituted and appointed, by two even and equal Payments, the
first payment thereof to begin upon the first day of Febr. which shall be in
the Year of our Lord One Thousand six Hundred sixty five. The second payment,
to be upon the First day of February, which shall be in the year of our Lord,
One Thousand six Hundred sixty six, under the penalty following (that is to
say) every person liable to the payment of any part of the said Years Rent, and
making default, and failing to pay the same, by the space of Twenty days after
any the days and times wherein the same ought to be paid, shall be chargeable
and is hereby charged with double the sum, which ought to have been paid as
aforesaid, to be levied by process out of His MAJESTY'S Court of Exchequer, in
like manner as any the Rents whereof the said Earl of Orrery and Lord Massereen
were appointed Receivers by the said former ACT, might have been levied, and if
need so require, like course is to be taken for the ascertaining of the Value
of Lands charged with the said Years Rent, and of returning the same into the
Exchequer, to remain and be a charge upon Record, as in and by the said former
ACT, in case of the said other Rent therein secured was appointed; and the said
Receivers herein after appointed, are to account for and pay unto Arthur Earl
of Anglesey, Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, or to the Vice-Treasurer of Ireland for
the time being, all and every the sums of Money by them to be received.
Nevertheless it is hereby Declared and enacted, that all and every the sums of
Money, formerly paid to the Earl of Orrery, and Lord Viscount Massereen, in
pursuance of the said former ACT, shall be allowed to the person and persons so
paying the same, his and their Heirs, Executors and Assigns, in full discharge,
of so much of the Rent payable by this ACT, as the Moneys so as aforesaid paid,
do or shall amount unto; and the two half Years Rent payable to the said Earl
of Orrery, and Lord Viscount Massereen, by any Adventurer or Soldier, their
Heirs, Executors, or Assigns, by virtue of the said former ACT, shall be and
are hereby from henceforth Discharged: and in case the Moneys to be raised, as
aforesaid, shall fall short of the sum of Three Hundred Thousand pounds, then
it shall and may be lawful to and for the Lord Lieutenant, or other chief
Governor and Council there for the time being, to Tax and Assess upon all the
Lands in Ireland, so much more Money, as together with what has been before
raised and allowed by virtue of this ACT, shall make up the full and just sum
of three hundred Thousand pounds sterling. and to cause the same to be Assessed,
distributed, raised and levied by such ways and means as they shall think fit,
observing therein all the equality and indifferency that can be.

And whereas since the making of the said ACT His Majesty by Commission under
His Great Seal of Ireland, did appoint certain Commissioners for the
ascertaining the Years Rent of all Lands, by the said clause liable to the
payment thereof, who have ascertained the said Years Rent, and returned the
same into His Majesty's Court of Exchequer, by which return it appears, that
the whole Moneys raised and to be raised by the said Years Rent, do fall much
short of the sum of Three Hundred Thousand pounds in the said ACT mentioned,
the said whole returns of all the Lands liable to the payment of the said Years
Rent, amounting but to the sum of One hundred and ninety Thousand, Seven
hundred Eighty nine pounds, Eleven shillings Seven pence half penny.

And whereas the Barons of His Majesty's Court of Exchequer, have certified
unto Us under their Hands, that there have been discharged of the said Years
Rent so ascertained and returned by the said Commissioners by Judgments and
Orders of the said Court of Exchequer several sums of Money amounting in the
whole to the sum of Twelve Thousand One Hundred Seventy one pounds sixteen
shillings seven pence. part of the said sum of One hundred and ninety
Thousand, seven Hundred Eighty nine pounds, Eleven shillings seven pence half
penny, which said sums so discharged have been adjudged by the said Court to
have been assessed upon Lands, that by the said ACT are not liable to the
payment of the said Years Rent, and the said sum of Twelve Thousand One
Hundred Seventy One pounds, sixteen shillings seven pence, being deducted from
the said sum of One Hundred and Ninety Thousand, Seven Hundred Eighty Nine
pounds, Eleven shillings seven pence half penny, there remains of the said
Years Rent but the sum of One Hundred Seventy Eight Thousand, six hundred and
seventeen pounds, fifteen shillings and one half penny, which falls short of
the said Three Hundred Thousand pounds, the sum of one hundred twenty one
thousand three hundred eighty two pounds four shillings and eleven pence half
penny.

And whereas his Majesty by his Contract with our very good Lord, Richard Lord
Viscount Ranelagh, and his Partners, and His Gracious Letters bearing date the
One and twentieth day of September 1671, has been Graciously pleased for the
ease of his Majesty's Subjects in this Kingdom, and out of His Clemency and
Favor to them to declare, That they shall be allowed Eight Half-yearly
payments, for the paying and answering of the said sum, which the moneys raised
by virtue of the said years value, shall be found to fall short of the said
three hundred thousand pounds, the First half-years payment thereof, to be made
on or before the twenty sixth day of March 1672: and the last payment thereof,
to be on or before the Twenty ninth day of September One thousand six hundred
seventy five, and has commanded us to cause an Assessment thereof to be made,
upon all the Lands in this Kingdom, according to the Power and Authority given
unto us by the said Act. And whereas the late Lord Lieutenant and Council, in
pursuance of His Majesty's said Gracious Letters by their Order bearing date
the 19th day of February 1671, did order that toward supply of the said
deficiency of the said years value, the sum of thirty thousand pounds should be
taxed and assessed on all the Lands in this Kingdom, the same to be paid at two
several payments, viz. on the 25th of March, and 29th of September 1672 by even
and equal portions, and whereas also we the Lord Lieutenant and Council, in
further pursuance of His Majesty's said Gracious Letters by our Order, bearing
date the One and Thirtieth day of January One thousand six hundred seventy two,
did Order that toward the further supply of the said Deficiency of the Years
value, the sum of thirty thousand pounds, more should be taxed and assessed
upon all the Lands in this Kingdom, the same to be paid at two several
payments, viz. one moiety thereof on the twenty sixth day of March one thousand
six hundred seventy three, and the other moiety thereof on the twenty ninth day
of September, one thousand six hundred seventy three, And whereas also we the
Lord Lieutenant and Council in further pursuance of His Majesty's said Gracious
Letters by our Order, bearing date the three and twentieth day of February one
thousand six hundred seventy three, did likewise Order that toward the further
supply of the said deficiency of the years value the sum of thirty thousand
pounds more, should be taxed and assessed upon all the Lands in this Kingdom,
the same to be paid at two several payments viz. One moiety on the twenty sixth
day of March last past, and the other moiety thereof on the twenty ninth day of
September last past.

And whereas there remains farther to be taxed and assessed for completing the
said three hundred thousand pounds, the sum of thirty one thousand three
hundred eighty two pounds, four shillings and eleven pence half penny, We
therefore in pursuance of the said clause contained in the aforesaid Act of
Parliament, and of the Power and Authority thereby given unto Us, do think fit,
and accordingly do Order, that the said sum of thirty one thousand three
hundred eighty two pounds, four shillings and eleven pence half penny be taxed,
assessed, distributed, raised and levied upon all the Lands in this Kingdom of
Ireland, in and throughout the several Cities, Towns and Counties in this

And We do farther think fit, and accordingly order, that the several and
respective Commissioners hereby appointed for the several and respective
Counties and Cities aforesaid, shall within Ten days, (or sooner if it may be)
next ensuing the publication hereof, meet together in the chief Town in each of
the said Counties, or some other convenient place, by the said Commissioners,
for that purpose to be appointed, which said Commissioners, or any three or
more of them, giving convenient notice to the rest, of the time and place of
such their meeting, are hereby required and authorized, in order to the
effectual and timely putting in execution the contents hereof, to divide and
apportion the said sum hereby made payable out of each respective County and
City, in as equal and impartial manner as they can, according to the manner and
form hereafter expressed.

That the said sum shall be equally assessed upon all the Lands and Houses
within the several Towns, Divisions, Baronies, and Parishes within the
respective Counties and places aforesaid, according to the sums charged upon
the respective Cities and Counties aforesaid, in the most equal and indifferent
way, that the said Commissioners, or the greater number of them so assembled,
shall agree upon.

And to the end no difference may arise in any case, between Landlord, Tenant,
and Occupier, what proportion of the said sum the Landlord or Tenant shall
respectively pay, the said Commissioners shall at their general meeting, set
down some Rule, and ascertain (according to equity and good conscience) what
they shall judge equal for the Landlord, and what for the Tenants respectively
to bear, and such proportion as shall be the proportion so adjudged to be paid
by the Landlord of the said Farmer, Tenant, or Occupier of the said land or
house, he the said Farmer, Tenant, or Occupiers of such land or house, shall
pay and discharge, and for the same shall be acquitted and discharged of so
much of his or their Rent, as the said tax charged on the Landlord shall amount
unto, and such payment shall be as effectual to all intents and purposes, as if
the same had been actually paid to his Landlord, or to any other person or
persons unto whom his rent shall become due and payable.

That if it shall happen, that any of the aforesaid tax be laid on any lands or
houses that are wast, and not sufficient to answer the same, or that any sum
hereby assessed upon any County, Division, or other place, shall by neglect,
mistake, or otherwise, fall short of what was to be thereupon levied in such
case, so much thereof as shall fall short by any the occasions aforesaid, shall
be re-apploted by the said Commissioners according to the same directions,
equally in the County, Barony or place wherein such tailer shall happen as
aforesaid, and shall be raised and levied in like manner as aforesaid.

That the several and respective Commissioners hereby appointed in the several
and respective Counties and Cities, shall meet together as occasion shall be
from time to time; And that the said Commissioners, or any Three or more of
them shall after the public Reading hereof, choose and nominate two, or three,
or more (if they shall think fit) of the honest and able Inhabitants in the
several and respective Baronies, Towns and Parishes aforesaid, and them appoint
to take a particular Survey or Estimate of each man's Estate, and to return the
said Survey or Estimate thereof, under their hands to the said Commissioners,
or to such person or persons of them as shall be by the said Commissioners
appointed to receive the same. In which survey or estimate, all due respect is
to be had, to value and to rate each Town-land, Tate, Ballibo, Quarter,
Division or Denomination of Land according to the value, quantity, quality, and
goodness of the same.

And in order thereunto, the said Commissioners upon the return of the said
Estimate or survey, are to ascertain what each place (according to the goodness
or badness, by a just rule of proportion) shall pay, taking care that the bad
and course land be not charged or burdened with the like sum; the profitable
lands of better value and worth are and ought to bear; and also to appoint and
ascertain each man's share and proportion due according to the said returns,
except they shall see cause to alter the said returns, and to amend any
mistakes therein which they are authorized to do if they see cause.

We do hereby further order and declare, That the several sums of money so
assessed, in the several counties and Cities of this Kingdom shall be received
and levied by, and paid unto such person and persons, and no other, as by his
Majesty's Commissioners of the Treasury in this Kingdom shall be appointed to
levy and receive the same; And the said Commissioners, or any three or more of
them are hereby authorized and directed forthwith to deliver unto such person
or persons, as shall by the said Commissioners of the Treasury be appointed, to
collect and levy the said money, a particular of what each man's charge in every
city, county, or parish shall amount unto, which sums are to be expressed both
in figures, and in words at length, together with a Warrant, requiring them
forthwith to collect and levy the said several and respective sums to each
man's name annexed, and to make payment of the said moneys so levied and
received to his Majesty's said Commissioners of the Treasury of Dublin.

And if any person or persons shall refuse or neglect to pay the several sums
of money on him or them taxed as aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for
the Collector or other person or persons so appointed as aforesaid, to receive
the said moneys, to collect and levy the sums rated as aforesaid by distress,
and in case the owner or owners of such distress shall neglect to pay his or
their tax, and to redeem his or their Goods so distrained within seven days
after such distress is taken, during which time the said Collectors are not to
remove the said distress out of the Barony where the same were taken; then the
said collectors are to cause the said Distress or Distresses to be sold
publicly in some Marketplace, at the best rate they can, causing the sums
charged on such persons to be paid thereout, and the overplus (if any) to be
returned to the owner, and the said collector, or other person or persons,
authorized for collecting the same, are hereby empowered to call to his or
their assistance, any constables or other person or persons in the due
prosecution of the premises, which assistance he or they so called, are not to
fail to give at their perils.

And whereas several Lands remain in his Majesty's hands as undisposed of, or
seized for arrears due to his Majesty, which Lands may be liable to pay a
proportion of the aforesaid tax, the said Commissioners are therefore in taxing
the said Lands, so in his Majesty's hands, to take care that no more be taxed,
assessed or levied on them, or any of them, but what the Lands may bear a due
regard being had to the quality thereof, and the rents and arrears due to his
Majesty out of the said Lands, that so as well the said rents and arrears may
be paid, as the sum or sums that shall be so taxed, assessed or levied in
pursuance thereof.

And to the end the Commissioners herein named, and all persons employed by
virtue hereof, may duly and impartially demean themselves in the execution of
the premises; No Commissioners herein named shall have any vote in any thing
concerning the present charges relating to his own particular Estate.

And to the end no disorder may be amoungst the said Commissioners of the
respective places hereby appointed, and that there may be no more meeting or
sitting of them for any one county but at one place: It is ordered, that at the
dissolving of any such General meeting of the said Commissioners, such certain
time and places for the meeting of the said Commissioners, or any of them be
appointed, as shall be then agreed on, by them the said Commissioners, and
published, by which all persons concerned may know when and where to give their
attendance.

And the said Commissioners, or any three or more of them, are to cause the
said respective sums within their respective Counties and Divisions to be
fairly written and subscribed by them, and to cause one Duplicate thereof to be
delivered to the respective Collectors that shall be appointed by his Majesty's
Commissioners of the Treasury to levy and receive the said Money, and another
duplicate thereof, to be returned into his Majesty's Court of Exchequer; and
the Clerk to be appointed by the said Commissioners to write the said sums,
and to make the said duplicates, shall for his pains therein be allowed two
pence in the pound to be paid him by the Collectors that shall be appointed to
receive the said moneys out of all such sums as shall be collected by them.

And we do further think fit, and accordingly order, That the Books or
Schedules of the said Assessment or applotment for the whole sum which shall
be charged on each Barony, as the proportion of the said Thirty one thousand
four hundred eighty four pounds two shillings and a halfpeny thereout payable,
shall be signed by the said Commissioners, or three of them, and delivered to
such Collector or Collectors as the sai^ ^ommisisioners of the Treasury shall
appoint as aforesaid, on or before the Tenth day of March next, together with a
Warrant under the hands and seals of the said Commissioners, or under the
hands and seals of three of them, authorizing and requiring such collector or
collectors to collect and levy the one moiety of each particular sum, in such
Book or Schedule of Assessment or Applotment, contained at or before the six
and twentieth day of March next, and to collect and levy the other moiety on or
before the Nine and twentieth day of September next, upon the respective
counties, cities, and Towns herein above mentioned.

And we do further think fit and accordingly order, that together with the
sums hereby appointed to be assessed, all such sum and sums of money as by
the above mentioned respective former Taxes and assessments of thirty thousand
pounds have been charged on any Lands that have not been collected, by reason
of the Land or Houses whereon the same have been charged being wast, or
otherwise shall be Re-assessed upon such county, City, or Town, wherein such
sum or sums have been charged and have not been collected, and shall be given
in charge in such Book or Schedule of Tax or Assessment to be collected and
paid in manner as aforesaid; And it is lastly declared, That it is not hereby
intended to make void or weaken any Contracts o^ ^greement that has b^^n made
between any Landlord and Tenant, concerning the payment of Taxes.
