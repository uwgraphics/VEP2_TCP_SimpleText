The PROTESTANT Seaman's Resolution To Fight for King WILLIAM.
OR The Total Destruction of Popery in this Reformed Land and Nation.
To the Tune of, The Soldier's Departure.


COme brave noble hearted Seamen,
let us a^l with Courage stand,
To maintain our Natives free men,
in this Ancient Christian Land;
That Rome never may enslave us,
by their crafty Vi^^any;
We'll not do as they would have us,
but will pull down Popery.
This great Prince is come from Holland,
to maintain the Nations right;
We by Sea will bravely fall on,
when there shall be need to fight;
Cannons roar like Claps of Thunder,
on the foaming Ocean Sea,
For to keep the Romans under,
and to pull down Popery.
These two Fleets are joined together,
Britains blessing to regain.
Fearing neither Wind nor Weather,
Boys, we'll plow the Ocean main;
For to drive the world before us,
as our Enemies shall see,
France shall soon our Rights restore us,
for we'll pull down Popery.




Let true valliant Sou's assemble,
scorning ever to retreat,
Till we make all France to tremble,
at our vast commanding Fleet;
Boys, we'll keep them in subjection,
for we vow to keep the Sea;
King William will be out protection,
while we pull down Popery.
May the French King have no Trading
to the Lands which we belong,
But let us seize his Ships of Lading,
to retaliate our wrong:
Nay, and likewise for his Merit,
the Pope's Vassal may he be,
Or else drowned himself in Claret,
while we pull down Popery.
They have felt great Britains power
in the former ages past,
And there is Seamen to this hour,
that will fight while Life does last,
For their Native Land and Nation,
On the stormy Ocean Sea;
Now without all Disputation,
we shall pull down Popery.
I on board my Name will enter,
and not stand the least to p^use,
Life and Fortune freely venture,
to maintain the Christian Cause;
What can be a greater Glory,
than to fight for Liberty?
Send our Foes to Purgatory,
as we pull down Popery.
Might I have the greatest treasure,
which the Nation can afford,
And enjoy both peace and pleasure,
yet I Would freely go on b^ard:
This my Duty does require,
for to fight for Liberty,
Make our proudest Foes retire,
likewise pull down Popery.
To reward the hateful malice,
of the Antichristian Slaves,
Send them hence to Pluto's Palace,
make the feaming Seas their Graves,
Let them make their Invocation,
to their old St. Anthony,
While we purge and clear the Nation,
from the Dregs of Popery.
