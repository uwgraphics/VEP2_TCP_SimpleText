Even in the Twinkling of an Eye.


AS I lay musing all alone,
I heard a voice that loud did cry
Come give account now every one
even in the twinkling of an eye.
With that I heard a trump did blow,
and one said with a voice so high,
Destroy all things both high and low,
even in the twinkling of an eye.
Go forth he said, and do not stint,
throughout the world even by and by,
And bring them all to my judgment
even in the twinkling of an eye.
Destroy both Palace, Park and Game.
Castles and Towers that be so high,
To all things living do the same
even in the twinkling of an eye,
The Grant proud, the Tyrant fell,
woe, and alas then shall they cry,
For I will throw them down to hill
even in the twinkling of an eye.
With that I saw a Cloud was bent.
and one siting on it so high,
Prepared for to give judgment
even in the twinkling of an eye.
Then all that in the earth did rest,
stood up before him by and by,
The Books opened and nothing pressed,
even in the twinkling of an eye,
Divided were without delay
the good from ill continually,
Sentence was given that same day,
even in the twinkling of an eye.
The good on his right hand did stand,
praising him still most joyfully,
With Psalms of victory in their hand,
even in the twinkling of an eye.
The evil on his left hand did go,
crying out most lamentably,
Saying alas! come is our woe,
even in the twinkling of an eye.
Unto the good the Lord did say,
speaking to them most joyfully
Take thou the Kingdom that lasts for aye
even in the twinkling of an eye,
Unto the evil the Lord did turn,
saying to them most lamentably,
Go to the fire that ever shall burn,
even in the twinkling of an eye.
O Lord we pray for Christ his sake,
that shed his blood upon a tree,
To keep us from that fiery lake,
even in the twinkling of an eye.
FINIS.
