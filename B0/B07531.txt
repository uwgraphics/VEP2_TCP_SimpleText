Here begins the complaynte of them that been to late married

a young lady waves to two gentlemen

AFter plays sportes and daunces of solace
We must think to come to prosperyte
After that god of his haboundaunte grace
Will provide how that I may govern me
In mind I purpose wedded to be
In a better life may no man live in
Than to be married and life out of sin
All young lovers should them so affyle
That they love trewely and so for to live
With ardaunte wit and perfyte style
All unto goodness themself for to give
Than may they be sure that they shall thryue
So will I live in marriage clean and pure
To gods be houe and in creasynge of nature
To long have I lived without any make
All to long have I used my young age
I will all for go and a wife to me take
For to encreace both our twoos lynage
For saint John^ says that he is sage
That against his will does him govern
And our lords precepts him self for to learn
There is no greter pleasure than for to have
A wife that is full of prudence and wisdom
Alas for love night I am in point to rave
These cursed old men have an ill custom
Women for to blame / both all and some
For that thy can not their minds full fill
Therefore they speak of them but all ill
Now sith that I have my time used
For to follow / my folysshe pleasaunces
And have my self oftentimes sore abused
At plaes and sportes / pompes and daunces
Spending gold and silver and great fynaunces
For faut of a wife the cause is all
To late married / men may me call
The holy sacrament of marriage
Before holy church was ordained
For to increase humayne lynage
He that does other wise is not received
Before god / thus was man guerdoned
With woman for to live at his owene will
He is a fool that else where does nature spyll
I have done as the labourer does
That sometime is payned with trobyll great
For he leseth his pain for certain soth
That in the hye way sotweth his whete
Well I perceive that I did me forgete
Or that I put me in to household
I have lost my seed my work is but cold
Women and maidens / both good and ill
With me I held my self for to please
The one did rebel / the other abode still
Other made me well at mine ease
Cupydo than came me for to cease
Venus lyghted her bronde of fire
For such service such guerdov and hyre
Late mary.
Thus rauysshed in this said abusyon
I was taken with a cauteious wyle
That me thought to make conclusyon
Of my wedding within a while
But yet did they me begyle
They caused me for to make great dyspence
For I was no sooner wed through my negligence
I would do make comune I wys
My propre goods so was I light
Of wit and was all ways ready as is
A man of arms in point to fight
Other whiles I went me right
In to places my self solysytynge
But another frequented that being
If I with held any praty one
Swetely enough she made me chere
Saying that she loved no person
But me / and thereto she did swear
But when I went fro that place there
Unto another she did as much
For they love none but for their poche
I had five or six companyons
That haunted with me every hour
But I have known to such garsons
In secret they have done socoure
if that they enjoyed my paramoure
With great pain durst I it to them say
Force me was to keep counseyll always
I wot well that I have right sore varyed
For to have wylled for to live alone
For to have been to late married
For that I have herd so long a gone
For she that abandoneth to more than one
I dare will swear and there with it sustyne
That she abandoneth unto a dosayne
Folysshe regardes full of vanyte
I kest over swarte and eke contrauers
To day I had peace rest and unity
To morrow I had plete and process diverse
Break I did doors and fenesters
Sargeauntes met me by the way
And enprysoned both me and my pray
Subject I was to a meyny of bawdes
And unto a great company of brothelles
Which to me brought an hepe of rybaudes
Dronkardes that loved well good morselles
Knaves and thieves that would pyke quarelles
I gave them clothes I knew not their use
There is none so subtle but love does him abuse
Alas I have all my time spent and lost
Which for to recover is impossyble
Spent have I nature at great expens and cost
Against the right canon and of the holy bible
Offens done to god never ceasyble
In danger for to for fayte both soul and life
By defaute for to have taken unto me a wife
Like unto a best and horse or an ass
That cares not for to tomble in the fen
if that any with me playenge there was
An other to help I would go then
Mo gallantes a man should se than ren
After a wentche and lepe and hytche
Than dogs do about a farowinge bytche
She would to no manner a man escondyte
Each one she appetyted for to receive
Taking therein pleasure and delight
To the end their silver for to have
But in the stead children to conceive
Botches pockes / and goutes they engendre
In hedes and in legs and in every menbre
In this manner of sykenesse many there be
That been Impotentes hanged and deed
But little semblaunce they make on to se
Taken as they ben / not beggynge their bread
Have you to be wedded thus I you read
Unto the end that ye be not cappable
Of this great danger / deedly and incurable
Now am I out of this danger so alenge
Wherefore I an glad it for to persevere
Long about have I ben me for to renge
But it is better to late than to be never
Certes I was not in my life till hither
So full of Joy that does my heart in spyre
Wedded folk have time at their desire
Out am I now of thought dole and moan
Living ever more right amorously
For I have a wife by my self alone
At my commandment both late and erely
And if it happen that I look heuely
My wife me kysseth and than she me colleth
And right woman there she me consolleth
To that I will have done she is ready
Never will she against my will say
She does to me the best that she can truly
Nothing of my volenty she does me nay
If I be angered or trobled any way
Ready she is to change my purpose
Unto the end that I may have all my repose
I have me all to long refrayned
Furnysshe I can not to all her pleasyre
And for to promise her I am constrained
More than I can do to her desire
She appetyteth it much and does me enspyre
Gorgyously showing her fair corsage
But I am all caduc and weary for age
I ought for to have by this many children
Some sport and play and some at fire sitting
Other in the field to shote lepe and ren
And some hardy / some merry / and tryumphynge
In whom I should have all my delytynge
But to late maryd without en dout
May never se his children ren out
My wife showed to me her proper dugge
On the morning her delight for to make
And to have me for to play nugge a nugge
Alas I would it full feign forsake
But force it is such lessons to take
And to rise up erly as I think best
In the morning and go unto my rest
When I se her lie in shetes fair and white
As read as the button of the rose
With good will would I take than delight
Nevertheless I let her have her repose
For it is force that I cast again on the close
And to make a pawse than I am conioynt
For thynstrument is not yet well in point
But yet sometime I me constrayne
To take nature solace thus think I
But all suddenly I me refrain
For I do fere to be to soon weary
And than I sleep with courage all drery
And yet am I / I can not pass
Upon women more than ever I was
Constrained I am to be full of Ialousy
Seeing that I can not content her mind
Touching the play of love all softely
Often enough the experyence to find
She me assayeth and tourneth by kind
Casting unto me her beggynge leg
But I do sleep I care not for such a beg
With her eyes pleasant casting a regard
In chastynge a laughter a merous
Than with a praty smyle she does me larde
And that makes me some what Joyous
But coming to a bed delycyous
For to hold the spear in a full hand
It plyeth and fails for will not stand
When I herd her babble and langage
Her gentle terms spoken so properly
I do me wysshe for to be in to the age
Of eyghten / neyntene / or four and twenty
Such assautes than give would I
That for it should have no need to crave
Of the great pleasure that she should have
If that she go to banckettes and daunces
She does none offense therein certain
Needs she must have her plesaunces
In some place to make her glad and feign
Wherefore I dare well say and sustain
That after with me I would have her led
If any sooner I had been to her wedde
We twain should have all our yongenesse
After marriage custom and right
Passed in Joy / solace / and gladness
And is wherefore I have me pyght
Force it is to me that the fire be night
That at a need I can not have quenched
To late married is for to be complained
Late mary.
It is said that man in seruytude
Him puts / when he does to woman bend
He ne has but only habytude
Unto her the which well does him tend
Who will to household comprehend
And there a bout studyeth in youth always
He shall have honor in his old days
Some children unto the courts hauntes
And ben puruayed of benefyces
Some haunteth markettes and be merchants
Byenge and selling their marchau^dyses
Or else constytued in offices
Their faders and moders have great solace
That to late married by no way hase
I be wayll the time that is so spent
That I ne me hasted for to wedde
For I shall have heritage and rent
Both gold and silver and kynred
But sith that our lord has ordained
That I this sacrament take me upon
I will keep it trewely at all season
Theophrastus us shows in his prose
That in marriage all is out of tune
So does also the romanuce of the rose
Composed by master Ioha^ de mehune
Yet nevertheless it is all comune
That they never were in bond of marriage
Wherefore at all aventures is their langage
Matheolus that was holden so wise
For to blame womem was all his ebate
Suppose that he was married twyse
For he was so old that balde was his pate
For he came the last time so very late
That in him there was no puyssaunce
Amyte / solace / Joy ne pleasure
But when that a man may do no more
He blame that / that he can not do
To late wedded the surplus therefore
May not furnysshe as other may do
For when he wened to satysfye lo
Nature at need will not him prevail
Such wenes do to well yt other while fail
If that there be any tryfelers
That have wylled for to blame marriage
I dare well say that they ben but liars
Or else god failed in the first age
Adam bears witness and tesmonage
Married he was and comen we ben
God did choice marriage unto all men
Now sith it is thus befall
Why than ought we it to blame
Us for to put we ben holden all
So should we always hold with the same
Or else holy scripture says it is shame
And that alleggeth all predycacours
Our lord god hates all fornycatours
Late mary.
I am now sorry that I have no rathe
Put my self in to maryages rout
For many a folysshe look it has
It has me cost / here and there about
But yet my soul is in great doubt
For god fornycatures punyssheth
And out of this realm he them banyssheth
There is no man living that can commyt
Without outen the work of nature
But he in marriage does commyse it
As us tells the holy scripture
It is than folly to any creature
Thus for to blame his creason
For any manner of folysshe opinion
All they that by their subtle arts
Has wylled for to blame marriage
I will sustain that they be bastardes
Or at leest way an evil courage
For to say that therein is seruage
In marriage / but I it reny
For therein is but humayne company
If there be ill women and rebel
Shrewed dispytous and eke felonyous
There be other fair and do full well
Propre / gentle / lusty / and Joyous
That been full of grace and virtuous
They ben not all born under a sygnet
Happy is he that a good one can get
To late married now help than me
To make my sorrows and complayntes
For by my faith I swear to the
I have suffered many dolours and crayntes
And have sustained mo attayntes
Than ever deed wat after the hounde
At dyspence I lived and that have I found
Galantes plain ye the time that ye have lost
Mary you be time as the wise man says
Tossed I have been fro pyler to post
In commysynge natures work always
I have passed full many quasy days
That now unto good I can not mate
For mary I did my self to late
Rychely in a raye ought for to go
These women that be obedyent
Better than these cursed wives do
That been not to their husbands pacyent
To take a wife was mine intent
Gods laws to keep and them to observe
Saving of nature and heaven to preserve
Before that ever I was married
Bordeles I haunted and places of infame
But I am now unto a wife alayed
The world to hold and honor gods neme
That wicked man I hold to blame
That follows evil ruell and will not amend
Unto his soulles heth and honor to pretend
Late mary.
When a man to old age is faden and fall
Learn this lesson harken my sentence
Few friends meteth he with all
That will to his pouerte take any intellygence
Woe worth than cry they of the expense
That they have spent unto youths lust
And now they must dye for hunger and thurst
Better it is in youth a wife for to take
And live with her to gods pleasaunce
Than to go in age for gods sake
In wordely sorrow and perturbaunce
For youths love and vtteraunce
And than to dye at the last ande
And be dampened in hell with the foul fend
The auctour.
Rychenes in youth with good governance
Often helps age when youth is gone his gate
Both young and old must have their sustenau^ce
Ever in this world so fekyll and rethrograte
Right as an ampte the which all gate
Trusseth and caryeth for his lives fode
Any thing that which him seems to be good
Christian folk ought for to have
Open hertes unto god almyght
Putrynge in their mind thyr soul to save
Learning to come unto the eternal light
And keep well their marriage and troth plyght
Nothing always of their last end
During their lives how they ye time spend
Here ends the complaynt of to late married
For spending of time or they a board
The said holy sacrament have to long tarried
Humayne nature tassemble and it to accord
Enprynted in Fletestrete by wynkyn de Word
Dwelling in the famous cite of London
His house in the same at the sign of the Son.
FINIS.
