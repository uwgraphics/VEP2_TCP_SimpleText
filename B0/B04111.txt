Little John and the four Beggars, A new Merry Song of Robin Hood and little
John, Showing how Little John went a Begging, and how he fought with four
Beggars, and what a prize he got of the four Beggars,
The tune is, Robin Hood and the beggar


ALL you that delight to spend some time
with a hey down down a down down
A merry Song for to sing,
Unto me draw near and you shall hear
how little John went a begging.
As Robin Hood walked the Forest along.
with a hey, etc.
And all his Yeomandree,
Says Robin some of you must a begging go
and little John it must be thee.
Says John if I must a begging go,
with a hey, etc.
I will have a palmers weed,
With a staff and a Coat and bags of all sort
the better then I shall speed.
Come give me now a bag for my bread,
with a hey, etc.
And another for my cheese
And one for a penny when a; I get any.
that nothing I may leese.
Now little John he is a begging gone,
with a hey.
Seeking for some relief,
But of all the Beggars he met on the stay,
little John he was the chief,
But as he was walking himself alone
with a hey, etc.
Four beggars he chanced to spy,
Some deaf and some blind and some came behind
says John here is brave company.
Good morrow said John my brethren dear
with a hey, etc.
Good fortune I had you to see,
Which way do you go pray let me know,
for I want some company,
O what is here to do then said little John
with a hey.
Why rings all those bells said he.
What dog is a hanging come let us be ganging
that we the truth may see,
Here is no dog a hanging then one of them said
with a hey etc.
Good fellow we tell unto thee,
But here is one (...) will give us cheese and bread
and it may be one single penny.
We have brethren in London another he said
with a hey, etc.
So have we in Coventry
In Barwick and Dover and all the world over
but nere a crookt car^il like thee


THerefore stand thee back thou crooked care
with a hey.
And take that knock on the crown,
Nay said little John I Will not yet be gone
for about will I have with you round,
Now have at you all then said little John,
with a hey.
If you be so full of your blows,
Fight on all four and nere give ore,
whether you be friend or foes
John nipped the dumb and made him to rore
with a hey:
And the blind that could not see,
And be that a Cripple has been seven pears
he made them run faster then he,
And flinging then all against the wall,
with a hey.
With many a sturdie bang
It made John sing to bear the gold ring
Which again the walls cried twang
Then he got out of the beggars Cloak
with a hey.
Three hundred pound in gold
Good Fortune had I then said little John
such a good fight to behold
But what found he in a beggars bag
with a hey
But three hundred pound and three
If I drink water while this does last
then until death may I dye
And my begging trade I now will give over
with a hey, etc.
My fortune has bin so good,
Therefore I Will not stay but I will away
to the Forest of we cry Sherwood.
But when to the Forest of Sherwood he came
with a hey
he quickly there did see
His Master good bold Robin Hood
and all his company,
What news what news then said Robin Hood
with a hey.
Come little John tell unto me,
How have thou sped with thy beggars trade
for that I fain would see,
No news but good then said little John
with a hey,
With begging full well I have sped
Six hundred and three I have here for thee
in silver and gold so te^
Then Robin Hood took little John, by ye hand,
with a hey,
And danced about the Oak tree,
If we drink water while this does have
then an it death may we die.
So to conclude my merry new Song,
with a hey.
All you that delight it to sing
It Is of Robin Hood that Archer good
and how little John went a begging
