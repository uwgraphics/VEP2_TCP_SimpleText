His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT On Thursday
the 31 of December,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Must not lose this occasion of Returning you My hearty Thanks, for the great
^roofs you continue to give Me of your Zeal and Resolution to Support and
Assist Me, in the Vigorous Prosecution of the War against France next Year; and
I Assure you it shall be My greatest Care that the Assistances you give Me may
be so Applied, as to Render them most Effectual for the Ends you design them:
but I must take Notice to you at the same time, with some trouble, that the New
year is already come, while Our Preparations^^r it are not only more backward;
but those of Our Enemies, as We have reason to think, in greater forwardness
then they were the last Year: I find My Self therefore Necessitated from this
Consideration, most earnestly to Recommend to you, Gentlemen of the House of
Commons, the Hastening of such further Supplies as you design to Enable Me with,
for the Prosecution of the War.

My Lords and Gentlemen,
The Season being so far Advanced, this present Sessions cannot admit of a much
longer Continuance; and therefore I must Recommend to you the Dispatch of all
such other Bills also, as you shall judge necessary for ^he Public Good.

Edinburgh, Reprinted by the Heir of Andrew Anderson, Printer to Their most
Excellent Majesty's, Anno Dom. 1692.
