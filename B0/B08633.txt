THE CASE OF Henry Million, STATIONER
Is as follows,

HE attended and solicited the last Parliament for several years, was at very
great Charges in promoting the Woollen Manufactures: but more especially he
first brought in by Sir George Downing the Bill for Burying in Woollen, which
does now enable us to make the best Paper, and followed the same at a great
expense, till it was past into an Act, which has proved very beneficial to the
Kingdom: For which the Lord Chancellor granted him a License to Print the
Affidavits, and so he printed them, the Warrants and Certificates, agreeable to
the Act: which was all he could obtain for his great Pains and Charges. But
since the Dissolution of the Parliament and the Expiration of the Act for
Printing: several others do now invade his Privileges, and the benefit
intended him for his Pains and Charges wholly lost, and to his utter Ruin,
unless now remedied and assisted by this Honorable House, your Petitioner
therefore humbly prays that it may be incerted into the now Enacting Clause,
that is to be brought in for the making the Oath in the said Act more easy to
the People that he should have the Liberty to Print the said Affidavits,
Warrants and Certificates and none other, He felling them for a penny a piece,
or what price this Honorable House shall think fit.

And if encouraged by your Honors, in this, then your Petitioner in all
Humility is ready to attend this Honorable House, to propose that which will
be twelve hundred thousand pounds a year in the Kingdoms way.
