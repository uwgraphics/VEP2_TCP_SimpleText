A Lover forsaken of his Love.
To a new Court tune.


Joy to the person of my Love,
Although that she does me disdain,
Fixed are my thoughts.
And cannot remove,
But yet I love in vain.
Shall I lose the sight
Of my joy and hearts delight,
Or shall I cease my suit,
Shall I strive to touch?
Oh no that were too much,
She is forbidden fruit.
Ah woe is me,
That ever I did see
The beauty that did me bewitch,
But now alas I must forgo
The treasure I esteemed so much.
Oh whither shall my sad heart go,
Or whither shall I fly?
Sad echo shall resound my plaint,
Or else alack I needs must dye.
Shall I by her live.
That no life to me will give,
But deadly wounds my heart?
If I fly away,
Oh will she not cry stay,
My sorrows to convert?
Oh no, no, no,
She will not do so,
But comfortless I must be gone:
But ere I go
To friend or foe,
I Will love her, or I will love none.
A thousand good fortunes fall to her share,
Although she has forsaken me,
and filled my sad heart full of despair,
Yet ever will I constant be:
For she is the Dame
My tongue shall ever name,
For branch o^ modesty,
Chaste in heart and mind,
Oh were she half so kind,
Then would she pity me,
Oh turn again,
Be kind as thou art fair,
And let me in thy bosom dwell,
So shall I gain,
The treasuer of loves pain:
Till then, my dearest Love, farewell.
FINIS.
