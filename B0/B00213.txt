Here is an Item for you. Or, The Countrimans bill of charges, for his coming
up to London Declared by a Whistle.
To the tune of King Henry, etc.


DIogenes that laughed to see
a Mare once eat a Thistle,
Would surely smile and laugh the while,
to hear me sing my whistle,
For now, it is meant we must invent,
a silent way of ringing.
And so for fear lest some should hear,
must whistle stead of singing,
With a hay down, with a ho down,
With a hay down, down, down, derry,
since that we may
nor sing, nor say,
We Will whistle and be merry,
A Countryman to London came
to view the famous City,
And here his charge did grow so large,
it made me write this Dittie,
For in a Bill he set down still,
his charge from the beginning,
Which I did find, and now do mind,
to whistle stead of singing,
With a hay down, etc.
Imprimis, coming unto town,
and at my Inn alighting
I almost spent a noble crown
in potting and in piping,
Item, that the Tapster there
my Iugges half full did bring in,
I dare not say he was a K.
but I Will whistle stead of singing.
With a hay down, etc.
Item, that I went abroad,
and had my purse soon picked,
While I did stare on London ware,
by a Pick-purse I was fitted.
Item, that I met a wench,
that put me down in drinking,
I dare not say what she made me pay,
but I Will whistle stead of singing.
With a hay down, etc.
Item, that I met withal
a very loving Cosen,
Who needs would be of my Country
and gave me half a dozen,
And at the last a pare of Cards
they cunningly did bring in,
I will not say what they made me pay
but I Will whistle stead of singing,
With a hay down, with a ho down,
With a hay down, down, down, derry,
since that we may,
nor sing nor say.
We Will whistle and be merry,
Item, that I daily went
unto my Lawyers Chamber,
And he did say. I should win the day,
without all fear or danger,
But then at last, for charge and cost,
he such a Bill did bring in,
I will not say, what he made me pay,
but I Will whistle stead of singing,
With a hey down. etc.
Item, that I paid there, for
a bagpipe in a bottle,
Which did begin to hiss and sing
when we did stir the stople.
Item, that one night I did lie
in the Counter for my drinking,
I will not say, what I paid next day
but I Will whistle in stead of singing.
With a hey down, etc.
Item, that at last I came
to take my horse again,
But my poor horse looked never worse,
his belly did complain,
For he alas for want of hay,
stood ore the manger grinning,
Yet they made me pay for night and day
but I Will whistle stead of singing.
With a hey down, etc.
The Country-mans going down into the Country, Declared by a whistle.
To the same tune.


THus having got from London once,
he rid full heavy hearted,
For like an honest man he had
from all his money parted.
His Cloake-bag full of papers was,
in stead of money gingling,
I dare not b^st what those papers cost,
but I Will whistle stead of singing.
With a hay down, with a ho down,
With a hay down, down, down, derry
since that we may
nor sing, nor say,
We Will whistle and be merry.
Imprimis, coming home, he found,
his good wife Ioane a brewing,
And did not defer but unto her
his papers fell to showing.
But when she saw, nothing but law,
she fell to scold and flinging,
But all that day he kept away,
and whistled stead of singing.
With a hay down, etc.
Item, then he went to plough
which whiles that he was driving
Alas says he what fools are we,
in law to fall a striving,
For now I mean to keep my ^eeme,
which shall good profit bring in.
I most drive on my money's gone,
and whistle stead of singing.
With a hey down, etc.
Item, that his neighbor came
to ask what news at London,
Alas says he, more wiser be,
for fear that you be undone.
Spend not at Term what you do erne,
while that your wines are spinning,
Which makes me now to drive the plough,
and whistle stead of singing.
with hey down, etc.
For be it known unto you all,
that I my money spended
Such fools as I will beggars dye
before their lives are ended.
Therefore beware and have more car^
when that your mony's gingling,
Least when it is spent you do repent
and whistle stead of singing.
With a hay down, etc.
For I so many Items had,
yet could not I beware,
For this and that and I know not what,
this Item brings my care,
Yet let this be to all of you,
an Item which I bring in,
Lest money spent makes you repent,
and whistle stead of singing,
With a hay down, etc.
Yet one more Item I will add
since that my song is ended
My Item's this, that I would wish,
no man to be offended,
With all my Items but to save,
his money when it is gingling,
Least when it is spent, he do repent,
and whistle stead of singing,
With a hay down, with a ho down,
With a hay down, down, down, derry,
since that we may
nor sing, nor say,
We Will whistle and be merry.
EINIS.
