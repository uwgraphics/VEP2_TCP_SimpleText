(...) OR, Pretty Comparisons wittily grounded,
Which by scornful Maidens may best be expounded.

To the tune of, Like to the Damask Rose: The second strain to be sung twice
over.


LIke to a Dove-cote never haunted,
Or a Petition never granted;
Or like broad-cloth without a Tailor,
Or like a Iayle without a Iaylor;
Or like a Lantern without a light,
Or Wedding Day without a night:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The Dove-cote haunted,
yields much profit;
The Petition granted,
good comes of it;
The Tailor puts
broad-cloth in shape,
The Iaylor lets
no Prisoner 'scape;
The Candle light
is the Lanthornes treasure,
The Wedding-night
crowns all the pleasure:
So is that Maiden
in mine eyes,
Who loves and marryes
ere she dies.
Like to a Ring without a finger,
Or like a Bell without a ringer;
Or like a Horse that is never ridden,
Or like a Feast, and no Guests bidden;
Or like a Well without a Bucket,
Or like a Rose and no one pluck it:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The Ring, if worn,
the finger decketh,
The Bell, if rung,
good music makes;
The Horse does ease,
if he be ridden,
The Feast does please,
if Guests be bidden;
The Bucket draws
the water for thee,
The Rose, when plucked,
is then most worthy:
So is that Maiden, etc.
Like to a Stock not grafted on,
Or like a Lute never played upon,
Or like a Jack without a weight,
Or like a Bark without a fraught,
Or like a Lock without a Key*
Or like a Soldier without pay:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The Stock that is grafted,
yields best fruit,
Best Musick's in
the fingered Lute,
The weight does make
the Jack go ready,
The fraught does make
the Bark go steady,
The Key the Lock
does open right,
The Soldier paid
is prone to fight:
So is that Maiden, etc.
Like to a Needle without thread,
Or like a word without a deed,
Or like a warrant never sealed,
Or like a thought that is nere revealed,
Or like a line without a hook,
Or like good meat without a Cook*
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The thread with Needle
yields much pleasure,
The deed and word
make decent measure,
The Seal in force
the Warrant makes;
The thought revealed,
all doubt forsakes,
The Hook with Line
does catch the Fishes,
The Cook of meat
makes wholesome dishes*
So is that Maiden
in mine eyes,
Who loves and marryes
ere she dies.
The second part.
To the same Tune.


LIke to a Question and no Answer,
Or like a call without Anon Sir,
Or like a Ship was never rig'd,
Or like a Mine was never dig'd,
Or like a wound without a plaster,
Or like a household and no Master:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The Question answered,
strife appeaseth.
Anon, Anon,
the caller pleases,
The rigged Ship
sails with the Wind,
Who digges the Mine
shall treasure find;
The wound is by
the plaster cured,
The house by the Master
is secured:
So is that Maiden
in mine eyes,
That loves and marryes
ere she dies.
Like to a Marrow bone nere broken,
Or commendations and no token,
Or like a Fort and none to win it,
Or like the Moon and no man in it,
Or like a School without a Teacher,
Or like a Pulpit and no Preacher:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The Marrow bone
that is broke eats pleasant,
The Token makes
a grateful present,
There Is triumph in
the Fort that is won,
The man rides glorious
in the Moon,
The School is by
the Teacher styled,
The Pulpit's by
the Preacher filled.
So is that Maiden, etc.
Like to a Pistol and no shot,
Or like a Promise quite forgot,
Or like a Hawke that is never manned,
Or like a Hide before it is tan'd,
Or like a Coach and nere a horse,
Or like a Coffin and no Corse:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid*
The Pistol charged,
helps in danger;
He that keeps promise,
is no ranger;
The Hawke that is manned,
yields Princely sport;
The Hide well tan'd,
there is much use for it;
The Horse does cause
the Coach to carry,
The Coffin's used
the Corse to bury:
So is that Maiden, etc.
Like to a house by no one kept,
Or like a Corn field never reapt,
Or like a Windmill without sails,
Or like a Horse-shooe without nails,
Or like a Cage without a Bird,
Or like a Scabberd and no Sword:
Just such as those
may she be said,
That time does lose,
and dies a Maid.
The house well kept,
Guests entertaineth;
The Corn field reapt,
man's life sustaineth;
The Windmill sails,
the Grain well grindeth*
Horse-shooes with nails,
sure footing finds;
The Bird in Cage,
sings merrily;
The Sword in sheath,
shows decently:
So is that Maiden
in mine eyes,
Who loves and marryes,
ere she dies.
