A pleasant new Song, if you will hear it, you may,
Of a North-country-Lasse that had lost her way.

To a new Court tune.




WIthin the North country,
as true report does yield*
There stands an ancient country town,
is called merry Wakefield.
Within this Country town,
a lively less does dwell,
She goes unto the market place
her huswifery to sell.
And walking all alone
upon a certain day,
For to be short, it so fell out
this fair maid lost her way.
So wandering all alone
upon the hill so high,
At last it was her luckly chance
a Shepherd for to spy.
Was sitting all alone*
upon the mountain top,
Singing bravely under a bush,
and viewing of his flock.
To him this fair maid hyed,
and over the hills crossed:
That he might put her in the way,
which she so long had lost.
So walking thus apace,
at length she came him nie,
Whereas he sat under a bush,
and did him courtesy.
God speed Shepherd she said,
merry day to thee God send,
I am vndon^ our Shepherd she said,
if you stand not my fri^nd.
I going am quoth she,
unto yon market town,
But by mischance have lost my way
upon this hilly down.
I wandering here have bee^e,
ere since it was break of day:
Yet could I never find which was
to me the nearest way,
The Shepherd then replyde*
fair maid sit down a while,
And I Will show you the nearest way,
at least by half a mile.
O no Shepherd she said,
if I should stay here long.
I should not reach they market town,
till all the market's done.
Fear not the Shepherd said,
but sit thou on this grass.
For thou shall hear my Bag-pipes go
before thou further pass.
So down the Maiden sat,
the Shepherd sat here by,
And then he plucked his bag-pipes forth
and played melodiously.
The second part.
To the same tune.




HE plased her such a fit.
it made her bravely sing:
The music of his Bag-pipes sound
made all the vallyes ring.
When that his wind was spent,
and he grew somewhat weary:
He told her which way she should go,
and pass over no ferry.
Shepherd* Shepherd, she said,
if reason may permit,
Come play that lesson once ^gaine,
I may it not forget.
Then at the Maids request,
although it grieved him sore,
He played it over twice as long
as he had done before.
Then did she take her leave,
yet loath she was to part,
Although I go, Shepherd she said,
I Will leave with thee my heart.
Fair well Shepherd she said,
adieu, nay twice adieu*
If ere I chance to lose my way,
I Will come again to you.
The Shepherd then replyde,
O no, O no not so
You shall taste some of my brown beer,
ere that you further go.
And some of my white loaf,
and some of my green cheese,
If I should stay* the maid replide,
the market I should leese.
And then my Dame quoth she,
will storm, and swear and frown,
If I sell not my huswifery
before that I come home.
What is your huswifery,
fair maiden show to me:
Two pair of stockings she replyde:
Come buy them now of me.
What is the price quoth he,
of this you huswifery?
Half a crown the maiden said.
Hold take here is thy money.
The less she was so glad,
her huswifery was sold,
To stay longer Shepherd she said,
I dare be somewhat bold.
So down she sat again,
until the day was spent:
And he had folded up his Sheep,
then both together went.
Each to his several home.
where what became of them,
I do not know, and therefore now
here will I stay my pen.
FINIS.
