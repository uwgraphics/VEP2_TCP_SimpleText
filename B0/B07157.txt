The Printer to the courteous Readers.
GEntlemen, I present you here with the fifth book of Amadis de Gaul, of whose
delectable history you have already perused the first and second books:
wherefore it may be, you rather expect the third and fourth books to come
forth in due course, then that the fifth should thus untimely appear before the
rest. The cause of which unorderly proceeding, grew from this occasion: J
having only interest in this and the following books of Amadis, have already
set out this fifth book, being the first of those which are in my hands, and
also does begin with the hystory of Esplandian, being the son of Amadis:
intending by Gods grace to proceed with the others in due order as time does
permit. But as concerning the other Books which rest in another man's right, as
they are not in my power, so can J make no promise when they shall be
published: wherefore seeing that matter remains wholly to his will, I being
ignorant of his intent, did according to my own fancy go forward with my own,
which may the sooner produce him to set out his: but if he should not, yet will
I by Gods help go through with mine till I have finished all the parts that
are in my hands: which are Hystories so pleasant and delightful, that it were
great pity they should lie hidden from your gentle sight: especially, for that
they contain such high matters of knighthood and princely chiualry: All which
I humbly commend to your favorable censure.

Yours in all duty, A. I.

THE FIFTH BOOK OF Amadis de Gaul, containing part of the valiant acts of
Esplandian his son, and others.
CHAP. I. How Esplandian sleeping in the great serpent, when he awaked, he
found himself to be at the foot of the rock of the Enchauntresse, and what
happened unto him.
ESplandian that had fallen asleep in the serpent by means of the melodious
noise of trumpets, that the six Gentlewomen sounded along the shore, after he
had received the order of knighthood, as it has been declared unto you in the
end of our fourth book, when he awaked was much abashed that he saw not any
of the company that were there present when the Giant Balan dubbed him knight,
but found himself alone between the wings of that monstrous beast, at the
foot of a rock unknown to him, which rock was so high, that he thought it
impossible to climb up, but he was persuaded that Vrganda la Descogneue
(whose works and enterprises were most wonderful) had ordained it to be so,
and thereupon he comforted himself, going down into the body of the ship
(where the day before that great assembly had been) but he found no man; and
seeking further, he went into the chapel, where he espied Sergil his squire
fast sleeping, and hard by him two old men with rols on their heads,
apparrelled like Turks: with that he went to Sergil, and with his foot gave
him such a thrust, that on a sudden he started up, and speaking to his master
(as though he had never seen him before) asked him what he meant, whereat
Esplandian began to laugh, and said unto him: Good God, Sergil, have thou ben
in my company all thy life time, and know me no better? and taking him by
the hand, he drew him in such manner to him that therewith he awaked, much
ashamed to have committed such a fault: whereof seeking to excuse himself, he
said unto his master, By my faith sir, I was so fast asleep when you called
me, that I neither remembered you nor my self, and I am now more abashed then I
was before to think how I fell into so sound a sleep: That cannot I tell
(answered Esplandian) although as much has happened unto me. Then he told him
that he had slept, and when he awaked he found himself alone between the
wings of the Serpent, without any of the company that were with him when he
received the order of knighthood, and now (said he) we are arrived at the foot
of the highest rock that ever I saw, and withal it is so hard and difficult
to climb up, that I can find neither path nor way how to do it, yet have I
beheld it long, but (as I perceive) it is enuironned with the sea in such
manner, that considering the situation of the place, I certainly believe it is
the rock of the Enchauntresse, whereof in times past thou have heard by Amadis
my father. And as they were in this manner speaking, Sergil heard the two old
men snort (that as yet they had not once perceived) and demanded of Esplandian
if he knew them not: As God help me no (said Esplandian) for as far as I
remember I never saw them before, but I judge that Vrganda has left them here
to help us if we need. I pray you said Sergil let us awake them: then he
called them so loud that they rose up, Esplandian asking them who brought them
thither, but they made signs that they could not speak. It was then about
twelve of the clock, and Esplandian would willingly have eaten if he had found
meat, and said unto Sergil, Friend, never in all my life had I so good an
appetite to eat as I have now, but I doubt we shall find no victuals in the
ship, I pray thee Sergil let us go see, for as I perceive, if we trust unto
these dumb men, we are like to fare but hardly: but the dumb men perceived
well what he meant: wherefore going out of the chapel they entered into a
chamber that joined to the hall, from whence they presently returned, bringing
with them such quantity of meat that Esplandian and Sergil were never better
satisfied in all their lives: having dined and the tables uncovered, they went
unto the place where Esplandian had slept, from whence he showed Sergil the
rock whereof he had told him before, saying: Assure thy self Sergil, seeing
the serpent stirs not from hence, it is a sign that I must go upon this
high rock to see if there be any adventures, and if I can bring them to an end
I know not (answered Sergil) what you will do, but if you trust to the
coun^ell of our dumb men we shall stay long enough here before we have any
words of them. Let us land (said Esplandian) and with that he made signs to
the old men, that they should haise out the boat, whereunto they willingly
obeyed: which done, the first that entered was Sergil, then Esplandian (armed in
the same armor he ware when the great Balan dubbed him knight) and rowing with
their oars they made toward the rock, at the foot whereof they descended out
of the boat, leaving the two dumb men alone in the serpent, and as they were
looking for a way to get up, they found ye same path that Amadis and Gransador
had taken when they went up to see the strange adventures that the
Enchaunteresse had left there, and they had not traveled long, but that Sergil
perceived his master to want a sword, (for of all other armor he was well
furnished when he received the order of knighthood only of a sword) wherefore
he said unto him: sir, I know not whether you mean to go, but if we pass
forward, and that upon the top of this rock, if you find any dangerous
adventure, you have nothing to defend your self withal, but if you will
believe me, you shall rather take an oar out of our boat, for oftentimes the
stoutest man is overcome, not for want of courage or stomach to resist, but
for want of weapons to defend himself, and with that he went back unto the
boat, and bringing one of the oars with him, gave it to his master, in which
manner they began to mount upon the rock not without great pain, the way being
so difficult, the air hot, and Esplandian heavily armed. Notwithstanding they
ceased not to travail day and night, till they arrived at the Hermitage, where
the image of brass stood with a scrole of writing at his feet (as you have
read in the fourth book) which as then they could not discern by reason it was
dark, wherefore they determined to pass the night under the gate, not entering
any further, for it was extreme whote. Then Esplandian put off his helmet, and
laying down his shield, eat such meat as his Squire had brought with him:
which done, lying down upon the grass he slept till the morning that he and
Sergil entered into the chapel, where they beheld the image and the writing,
but neither of them could read it because the letters were in Greek, which they
understood not. Then Esplandian determining to go further, said to Sergil,
Friend, it is best for you to stay here till I come again, for if this be the
rock where my father and Gransador (whether it wear by fortune or willingly)
did once arrive, I remember I have heard them tell, that in Summer the air is
so whote therein that it breeds many venomous beasts, whereby thou might
receive some harm, being no better armed the^ thou art, but as for me thou
know I am predestined to those adventures that other men have failed to
accomplish, which puts me in hope either that I shall not live long, or I
shall accomplish the things that are foreshewed of me, and by that means shall
conquer the sword and the treasure, that for certain is said to be in an old
palace within this rock. What, said Sergil, Do you think that although I
should die a thousand deaths I would refuse to go with you? No by my faith,
for I know that without your company life will be irksomer to me then a thousand
deaths if a man could endure so many. Friend answered Esplandian I believe it
well, nevertheless if any inconvenience should happen unto thee, besides the
blame I might receive thereby, thy deed would be more esteemed folly, then
done of any courage: but not to me that have both armor and shield to fight
against the strongest enemy that may be found, wherefore I pray thee once
again do as I would have thee. Wherewith Sergil perceiving no remedy, turned
his head aside and began to weep. In ye mean time Esplandian laced on his
helmet, and hanging his shield about his neck with the oar on his shoulder,
kept on the paths that at the last brought him to the top of the rock, and
being there he went toward the broken castle, where he perceived the other
Image with the table that she held in her left hand, the contents whereof he
could no more understand then that of the Hermitage, wherefore without longer
staying he passed forward toward the chamber where the treasure lay, being
continually guarded by a most great and horrible serpent: and as he went
nearer to it, he perceived ye gates to be of hard stone, where there was a
sword so far thrust in, that nothing but the handle could be seen, wherewith
he thought it to be the same whereof he had heard, and being moved with great
desire to have it, he determined (although he had but a staff to defend
himself) to assail the beast, whatsoever happened thereby. And to the same
end with a bold courage he set forwards, but the serpent (that as the^ slept)
awaked, and looking with a cruel countenance upon Esplandian, began to hiss,
and cast out fire at he^ mouth as if she would devour him. Nevertheless
Esplandian covered with his shield went near unto her, and with his oar gave
her such a blow between the ears, that with the force he used, it had almost
fallen out of his hands. Notwithstanding the beast made toward him so
furiously that she overthrew him on the ground and troad upon his belly,
whereat he was not a little abashed, but perceiving what danger he was in,
suddenly ^art up, and by little and little got to the gate wherein the sword
stuck, which at the last he laid hold upon, and with both hands drew it to
him with such force that he pulled it out: and with that the gates opened with so
fearful a noise, that presently the serpent fell dead upon the ground, and
Esplandian was so astonished that he knew not what he did, but it was no
meruel for that Sergil that stayed in the hermitage, far from thence was in
the greatest fear that ever he had, and besides the sailors that as then
sailed along the coast, thought verily the rock would have fallen into the
sea, so great was the noise at the opening of the gate. Mean time Esplandian
lay in a swoune till midnight following that he opened his eyes, when he saw a
great brightness in the place, perceiving the serpent dead and the enchanted
sword lying by his side, which he took in his hand, and rising up entered into
the chamber, in the middle whereof he saw a tomb shining brighter then fire,
and upon it a great lion of brass, holding in his right paw the scabberd of
the sword, from whence the great brightness issued, and in his left a roll of
letters written in Latin, The contents whereof do follow.

CHAP. II. How Esplandian having read the writing contained in the roll that
the Lion held, took the shining scabberd, and what speech he and Sergil had
together.
THe fearful cries at the time of the great constraint, shall force thee (O
thou Knight that have conquered the sword) to return again to conquer the
great treasure whereby thy joy shall be restored in such sort, that the kindled
flames, by whose beams thou shall far off be wounded (shall be extinguished,
and content thy self with this glorious conquest thou have made: for that
variable fortune had advanced thee before all others, and thou have obtained
the honor whereunto so many good knights could never attain, notwithstanding
all their Prowess.

Esplandian having read and again perused the contents of the writing, for a
time stood musing thereon, and in the end perceived thereby, that although he
had brought the adventure of the sword unto an end, yet he should be
constrained to attend ye time appointed (according to the contents of the
writing) nevertheless he knew not the meaning thereof, being as then at
liberty and free from all the passions of love. Notwithstanding the cruel
Tyrant Love, afterward obtained so great a conquest against him, that he made
him fall in love with her that he never had seen, nor never was in her
company, as reading further in this history you shall at large perceive. Then
he laid hand upon the scabbard, and put the sword into it, thanking God
devoutly for the grace he had obtained. After that he went diverse times about
the tomb to see if he could open it without breaking, but he perceived the
crystal, from whence issued part of the brightness to be covered with
another plate colored like azure, so wonderfully wrought that it would scarce
be judged whether it were marble, metal, or any other stuff: whereupon he
left off his enterprise, and returned into the hall where the dead serpent lay,
but as then neither ye sword nor the scabberd yielded any such brightness as
before they did, because it was day: Then going out he went down again
toward the Hermitage where he had left his Squier, who being melancholy and
amassed at the long absence of his master, (fearing some danger happened unto
him) was gone out of the Hermitage to seek him, and he had not traveled
far, but he perceived him coming with the sword by his side, whereat he
made such joy, that being yet far from him, he cried out and said, O my lord,
blessed be God that has given you so good a beginning whereat every man shall
wonder. Friend (said Esplandian) he has yet done more for me then thou
would think, and with that he began from point to point to show him the
danger wherein he was, and being in that discourse, it waxed dark even then
when they arrived at the Hermitage: wherefore they determined not to travel any
further that night, but laid them down under the next trees they came unto,
still speaking of the strangeness of the place: whereat Sergil being more
abashed then before, could not refrain to say: As God help me Master, by good
reason you may be esteemed a better knight then Amadis your father, that came
into this place, and saw the Image at the Hermitage, the writing that stands
upon the arch of stone, the serpent, the sword that stuck in the gate where you
found it, and the shining tomb, yet durst he never prove any of these
adventures, and he said true, for Amadis knew well by the contents of the
letters written in Greek, that those adventures were ordained for his son
Esplandian, and therefore undertook them not, but all others, only Gransador
and Vrganda knew it not til the^, but although Sergil thought to please his
master using such words in his commendation, yet Esplandian took it not so
well, saying: I pray thee Sergil never use such speeches, for if the Prowess
and knightly adventures of my Father had been as well employed to the advancing
of the Christian faith as they were to win and obtain honor in this world, I
think his like would not be found, but having passed his youth in things so
vain and transitory, doubtless his glory is the less, not that I presume in
any thing to accuse him, and God forbid I should, yet is he known in so many
places to be so valiant a knight, that whosoever he be can second him may well
esteem himself happy among the happiest, wherefore I pray thee let us talk of
other matters. Thus sometimes talking and other whiles sleeping, day began to
appear, when they rose up, taking their way toward the sea side, descending
down the rock, till they came where the two dumb men stayed for them, one
within the ship, the other in a little bark, wherein Esplandian entered,
according to the sign the dumb man had made, and Sergil went into the serpent,
and with that they departed, and the bark sailed so swiftly, that in short
space they left the sight one of the other. But we will leave Sergil with his
dumb man, making extreme sorrow to see himself bereaved of his masters
presence, and will show you of Esplandian that from this time forwards shall be
called the black knight, by reason of the arms he bare, who being in the
little bark with his conducter, sailed so long that they took landing near
the Port where king Lisuart lay prisoner.

CHAP. III. How the bark wherein the black Knight and the dumb man sailed,
arrived in the borders of Turkey hard by the place called La montaigne defendu,
and of the discourse that an hermit and the Knight had together.
Ten days and as many nights together ye black knight and the dumb man
sailed on the sea, not knowing in what parts they were, for if he had enquired
of his guide, it had been but labor lost: ye eleventh day they discovered a
great and pleasant Island, where the knight being wearied with the impetuosity
of the waves, desired his guide to put his bark on shore, but he regarding
not his words, thrust it near unto a high rock, by nature cut in such manner,
that it seemed a wall purposely made for the defense thereof: and the country
was so (...) of woods and bushes, that it might be esteemed uninhabitable. Then
the dumb man showed him a path that led him up to the rock, and made him a
sign to go thither, where with he issued out of the bark, armed at all
points, and began to mount up, the weather was then extreme hot, whereby the
knight was so chased in his harness, yt he was constrained to put off his
helmet and carry it in his hand, till he perceived a little Hermitage among the
bushes, and before it stood a high cross, which pleased him well, not only for
the hope he had to find some one of whom he might enquire in what country he
was, but because he was assured that there dwelt a Christian, and with that
he perceived a man apparrelled like an Hermit, so old and withered that his
long white beard hung down to his girdle, carrying in his hand a pitcher of
water, that he had drawn out of a fountain not far from thence, and was
passing by when the knight spoke unto him, saying: Father, God save you, which
when the good man heard, he was in so great a mase, that for fear his pitcher
fell out of his hand and brake in pieces. Nevertheless by little and little he
came to himself again, and perceiving him that spoke unto him, answered and
said, My son, it is now twenty years past fithence I left the pleasures of
this world, and forseek my native soil to obtain the grace of God, and that
which most abasheth me is, that since the time whereof I speak I never found
man that as yet saluted me in this manner, and I think verily you are a
stranger in these countries, or else your speech and apparel disguiseth you
much. Father (said the knight) true it is I am a stranger, brought hither by
such means, that I neither know the country where I am, nor any man or woman
inhabiting therein, for you are the first creature that I met since I arrived
here, of whom I might enquire, assuring you that when I perceived this cross
it reioiced my heart, for it is the arms of the master that I serve. What
said the Hermit, do you then know the virtue thereof? I, answered the knight,
that I do, being well assured that upon the like cross our Redeemer (whereof
I speak) suffered death and passion. Alas said the holy man, you say true,
praised be his holy name, that once before I die he has given me the grace to
let me see a man on this side the sea that believes in him, assuring you sir
knight that you and I are only the two creatures in this country that are
Christians, for all the restare Pagans and idolaters. And as he would have
proceeded further, his speech failed him, doubting that he to whom he spoke,
was but a fantasy or shadow of a man, but at the last he waxt bolder, and in
manner of coniuration asked him if he were a mortal man or not? Mortal
(answered the knight) that I am for certain, and withal a sinner, which
displeases me much, and if it abasheth you at this present to see me here, I
am my self no less abashed to see you: for without doubt the manner of my
arrival in this country has been such and so strange, that I can render you
no reason thereof, but if you know the country where in we are, I beseech you
good Father tell it me to put me out of doubt. Gladly (said the Hermit) and
with that he took him by the hand, and led him to his Hermitage, and there
sitting down together upon a log of wood, the old man began to speak in this
manner, and said, Now sir knight, tell me I pray you what countryman you are,
Father (said he) Great Britain is the country where in my youth I was borne
and bred, I know not if ever you were acquainted therewith: How long is it said
the Hermit since you came from thence? It is fifteen days and more since I
was there said the knight, did you never know king Lisuart (said the Hermit)
that in my time reigned therein? Yes truly (said the knight) for I have seen
him many times: how did he when you came from thence said the Hermit? That
can I not certainly show said the knight, for he was lost and led away from
thence, but by whom or in what manner no man cantell, notwithstanding the great
pain and diligence diverse of his knights have used to find him out. When the
Hermit heard that, he seemed very pensive, which the knight perceiving,
thought in his mind that he could tell him some news, where upon he began to
behold him well in the face to see if he changed color, with that the Hermit
(that well perceived the Knights meaning) said unto him. Truly Sir Knight, not
without cause have I enquired so much touching King Lisuart, but before I will
show you my reason why, you shall understand that I am of great Britain as
well as you, where as yet the greatest part of my kindred are living, whom I
forsook at the same time that a Giant lord of this country married with a lady
who as then I served, and with her passed the sea, not only hoping to reap
some reward for my former service, but (as young men are moved) with a great
desire to see strange countries, but it fortuned, that my mistress being
forsaken of God, as soon as she arrived in this country, left his holy law
to receive the law of her husband, wherefore considering with my self, that by
reason as well of my natural weakness, as by often frequenting the company of
these countrymen I might fall into some error, I determined to withdraw my self
into this place, wherein I have endured much pain and misery, to the great
danger of my life, by reason of the controversy between the law of Jesus
Christ, which I hold, and the law of the Pagans that seek daily to destroy it,
that without the favor of my mistress that would not suffer them to displease
me, I had not lived so long as I have done among them, but when it pleases God
I will depart hence, and return again into mine own country, now you have heard
how I have hitherto lived, I pray you sir knight (said he) show me your
adventures, and who has brought you into this place from whence very hardly
you will ever be able to return again, but rather are in danger of most cruel
death, or to endure the most horrible imprisonment that ever was heard of,
which would grieve me much, not only for the great beauty and young years that
I perceive to be in you, but for that you are my native countryman. Father
answered the knight, you have done me great pleasure to show me the manner of
your life and bringing up, nevertheless before I satisfy your request, tell
me (if it pleases you) wherefore when you spoke of king Lisuart you seemed so
sad, which made me conjecture that you know some thing touching him. Son
(said the Hermit) you shall understand that a daughter of mine, servant to the
lady whereof I spoke, not long since came hither to see me, and told me that
he mistress returning from great Britain, whether she went to deliver a
brother of hers out of prison, brought with her very secretly a knight of great
estimation as she said, nevertheless I cannot assure you who it is: but as I
have learned since, they say the two Giants sons were much pleased therewith,
which makes me doubt, considering the news you have showed me touching king
Luisart, that he is most likely to be the man, for she is so well seen in the
art of Nigromancy and Magic, that oftentimes she procures mischief unto
those that never offended her. And in what country are we now (said the
knight?) You are between the marches of Turkey and Greece said the Hermit, for
this mountain parts both the countries, but it is so strong, not only by
nature, but by art, that neither of the two Princes of those countries, what
force soever they brought hither, could never win it. And now a Giant (son
unto my lady and mistress) and one of the most strongest and puissant knights
in ye East parts, (as many of his neighbors, whose goods he has by force
usurped, and that in despite of the Emperor, or any other contradicting the
same have proved) is lord thereof. Where dwells he (sai^d the knight?) Above
upon ye rock (said the Hermit) in a castle which he has most strongly
fortefied, and is kept with all diligence and care by a Giant one of his
brethren, with others, of as good condition as themselves, and which is more,
it is not possible to come near ye castle, but by a little path way whereon the
sea continually beats, at the end whereof there is a pair of stairs cut out
of the rock, whereby you mount up till you come to an iron gate, where a
villain, in whom the lord of the castle puts his trust, watches
continually, for there is no other entery, but only the great gate that is
defended with strong platformes and great Towers, in the middle whereof there
is a door so straight, that a man on horseback can hardly enter therein, and
that way most commonly those of the castle do use to issue forth. Before it
be night said the knight, I mean to see what manner of place it is, and if I
can I will know who it is, that was so lately brought thither. God keep you
from thence (said the Hermit) for thereby you will either procure your own
death, or at the least perpetual imprisonment. Happen what may (said ye
knight) I will prove what fortune it shall please God to send me. That were but
ill done of you (said the Hermit) for that men are bound to employ their
forces only in things that stand with reason and possibility thereby to reap a
benefit by their labors, otherwise they are to be esteemed desperate fools, and
not valiant and hardy knights adue^turing (without due respect) not only their
bodies, but their souls which are of greater price, and Christ himself has by
example plainly showed it unto us, for when the Devil came and tempted him,
bidding him do certain things, which in deed (as he was Christ) were possible,
but as be was man were impossible to do, he answered him that he should not
tempt the Lord his God. So my good son (said he) I would advise you to
desist from so unreasonable an enterprise. You may preach what you will to
persuade me to the contrary (said the knight) but I must do that where unto I
am called, which is to prove my self in those adventures that in man's
judgment seem impossible: otherwise those that have foreshewed of me, should
not only have traveled in vain, but be esteemed liers and fools. If then
their sayings be true, what greater honor can I obtain then bringing most
wonderful adventures to an end, I may from henceforth thereby restrain the rage
and fury of such men as hurt, and do injury unto others, contrary to the laws
of God and man? And if they be found liers I had rather they should be reproved
for their want of knowledge then I accused of any point of cowardice. And if
the worst fall out I will employ my force against such accursed people, (members
and ministers of the devil) whom by the help of God I shall overcome: and I
believe and am certainly persuaded (that if I die in those adventures) he
will receive my soul into his heavenly joy. The Hermit meruailed much to
hear the black knight speak so wisely, and with so great a courage,
nevertheless the great beauty and young years he perceived him to have,
moved him to so great compassion, that the tears ran down his eyes, and
therewith he said, Ha good knight, he in whom thou trustest, preserve thee
and send thee long life, and seeing thou art resolutely determined to pass
forward, I pray thee defer the time for this night, for it is already so
late, that although thou should have time enough to get unto the gate before
the sun goes down yet shall thou find it shut as it is accustomed to be,
whereupon the Knight kept the Hermit company till the next day in the morning.

CHAP. IIII. How the black knight went up the rock, where by force of arms
he slew three Giants, and dliuered king Luisart out of prison.
AT the Hermites request the knight stayed and ^are him company all night, who
entertained him in the best manner he could, where after they had supped, they
laid them down upon a little straw till day began to appear, when they rose
up, and the knight having said his prayers in the chapel, being armed at all
points, took his leave of the Hermit, that brought him a great part of his
way, and had gone further but he feared the Giants. Wherefore committing him to
God, he took his leave and returned. Being gone, the knight travailed so
fast, that having coasted along the sea shore, and passed the side of a great
and thick forest, he descended into the goodliesh meddow that ever was seen,
from whence he perceived the castle, situated upon the top of a high rock,
and making toward it, he came t^^ long bridge, finding no other way unto it,
at the end whereof was a broad causie paued, with stone, and the sea ^^^ting
continually against the towers, out of the windows he espied two knights, one
as he thought was a Giant, the ladies son* Notwithstanding he stayed not,
but took his way on the left hand and ^ounting up the steps, came to a
marble gate kept by a knight all arme^, that before he came at him cried as
loud as he could, saying, Thou accursed wretch, the color of thy armor fore
shows not so much sorrow and grief as here thou shall receive confusion.
What devil was be that sent thee hither being so young? Mean time the knight
by little and little got up the hill, making as if he heard him not, for he
had work enough to look to himself, the way was strait and uneasy to pass,
and therefore he bare his helmet under his arm. But when he approached the
gate and heard the other continue in his bravery, he answered him and said, He
that is afraid commonly threatens a fa^^^ o^^, as then b^e some, but if thou
desire to know the cause o^^^y coming, open me the gate, and thou shall see
if I can satisfy thy desire. With yt the Porter came down, (and while the
knight put on his helmet) he opened the gate, and looking out cried with a
loud voice, come in thou unhappy creature to the place where you (...) any
stranger had good entertainment. Then the black knight went in, and entered
into a vaut, mean time the gate was that whereby the place seemed very dark,
for there entered no light but only by a little hole that came through the
rock, and as he passed forward, the Porter that was behind, staying him, said
unto him Villain, leave thy armor here, and I will bring thee where the lords
of the castle shall reward thee according to thy deserts. It were better
(said the knight) without so much trouble to bring me thither, in as I am,
and I will follow thee. But I will not (said he) least I lose too much by
thee, for then my companion will have thy armor, which by right is mine, and
with that he lifted up his hatchet, thinking to cleave his head, whereat the
black knight stepped back, and with his sword gave him such a blow, that he
overthrew him on the ground, and stepping upon him, thrust him into the body,
and as he had done, there entered at the gate (that went out of the vaut) a
villain all armed, who thinking to speak to the Porter, with a rude and
churlish voice, said Argantes, why stayest thou so long to bring up that
accursed wretch that even now entered at the gate? Be content a while (said ye
black knight) I will be there soon enough both for thee and those that sent
thee, if the gates be open. With that he villain perceived himself to be
deceived, for he espied Argantes dead upon the ground, wherefore without longer
staying he turned his back, and pulling the door after him left the knight
shut unto the vaut, whereat he was abashed, fearing to be famished for want of
meat, but it fell out otherwise, for not long after he saw ye gate opened,
whereat there entered a Giant armed all in green, who perceiving the party
dead, and the knight that had slaien him standing by him, was in such a rage,
that he said unto him. Thou accursed wretch, I am much abashed how thou have
thus entangled thy self within this place, from whence while thou live thou
shall never be able to escape, but when thou have endured along and most hard
imprisonment, shall be constrained to end thy miserable days with a thousand
cruel torments that are prepared for thee. Art thou at that point (said the
knight) I hope rather before we depart to make thee bear this villain
company, that at my entering spared not to threaten me as thou do now. What
(said the Giant?) I assure thee I loved this dead knight as well as I love my
self, and now I find him in this manner slain before mine eyes, yet art thou
not afraid to boast thereof: By my head (said he) thou shall dearly buy it.
Behold I pray thee answered the knight, how thy unhappy fortune follows thee
at once, here before thy face thou see thy friend dead, and by the same
means thou shall likewise loose the soul out of thy body, which the devil
has waited for since thou first beganst to lead an evil life, That shall
soon be seen (said the Giant) and with that they encountered, and at their
meeting laid upon each other so fiercely, that with the noise they made, it
seemed ten knights fighting together: and so long they continued the combat,
that in the end the Giant waxed faint, which he perceiving, having lost the
greatest part of his shield, and in a manner all his blood, he began to fly,
and the black knight after him so fast, that before he could get out of the
vaut with one blow that claue his head to the teeth he slew him in the place.
And as the knight stepped forth, he met two Squires that came to see the
combat, who perceiving ye knight with his sword bloody in his hand, asked him
what was become of their guard. I have dealt with them (said he) as it has
pleased God to dispose? And how is that (said they) to send them both (said
the knight) an unhappy end of their wretched lives, that their souls might be
tormented in the everlasting pains of hell. With that they looked in and
perceived Argantes on the one side, and the Giant on the other as yet shaking
their legs with the panges of death: whereat they had so great fear, that in
great have they presently retired, crying with a loud voice, Come forth my
lords, come forth; for your uncle and the Porter are both slain, wherewith at
the gate of the dungeon there appeared another Giant unarmed, very young and of
a huge stature, named Frerion, who perceiving the black knight marching so
boldly toward him, held the door half shut, and with a loud voice spoke unto
him and said, By my fathers soul thou must surely be some devil disguised in
humane shape, otherwise it had been impossible for thee to have slaien two of
the best knights in the world, and in despite of the^ to enter thus far
within the castle, but of one thing am I well assured, that what pain or
torment soever I shall cause thee to endure, I cannot be revenged of the least
wrong and injury I have received at thy hands. Thou brufish and unreasonable
beast (said the knight) thou art surely worse the^ he of whom thou speak,
for that he being already judged of God, has neither mean to repent his
wickedness nor hope of salvation, but thou to whom it has pleased God to give
sense and reason to know both good and evil, do still persevere in thy
wickedness, making of vice a virtue, in such manner that by good right I may
better term thee a devil then those that are wearied and wax melancholy to
have so long attended for thy accursed soul, which I will shortly send them if
thou come forth into this court, or let me enter in. Then stay (said Frerion)
and thou shall see how I will teach thee to preach in other sort, and with that
he shut the door and went in to arm him, mean time the black knight sat
down upon a marble stone, and he had not rested long, but the Giant came
again, who bringing a great cimitere upon his shoulder, would have issued at
the gate, when the knight spoke unto him, saying. Stay a little I pray thee
before thou come forth, and grant me one request which in right thou can
not well deny me, for although neither courtesy nor any part thereof did ever
lodge within thy breast, that habit of knighthood wherewith thou art invested,
ought more to move thee to humanity then thy nature of it self affords.
Ask what thou will (said the Giant) and it may be thou shall be refused, both
thou and I (said the knight) are now on foot, I pray thee then let us fight in
the other court, that those of thy castle may behold the pastime: which he
said to the end that if he overcame his enemy as he doubted not thereof, they
should not shut him out. By my head (said the Giant) at the first, I thought
thou would have asked mercy at my hands, which would not much avail thee:
but seeing thy request is no other, I am content to grant it, although a
means to fly away were much more advantage unto thee, which these high walls
will not permit thee, if thou be once enclosed within them. Thou speak (said
the black knight) as thy nature yields, and I as virtue binds me, for the
rest let God work his will. Come in then (said Frerion) and defend thy self
from me if thou can. With that the black knight entered into a fair court
pa^^d with white marble, all galleried about and supported with pillars of
Purphire, in the midst whereof stood the portall that entered into the
house, where an old lady accompanied of diverse young gentlewomen stood looking
forth, to whom the Giant went, and kneeling on his knee, said unto her: Madame,
I most humbly beseech you, that neither for good nor evil which may happen
unto me in fighting with this knight, not one of your house be so bold to help
or favor me in any sort, for I my self will put him to death with this my
trenchant blade, and rising up again holding his shield before him with his
cimiterre in his hand, he marched toward his enemy, who having God on his side
(to whom he recommended himself) stood ready to receive him. Then there began
such a combat between them that their blows seemed two smiths forging upon
their anuiles, seeming like fire that the wind kindles in the air, and surely
the black knight had sped but hardly at that time had it not been for the
armor Vrganda gave him, that could not be cut by any weapon, and for the good
sword he conquered in the rock of the Enchantresse, wh^^ewith he struck not
one blow, but he drew blood on the Giant ^rerion, who nevertheless did
meruellously both defend himself and assail his enemy, but by evil fortune as
he thought to strike the knight on the right arm, he started back, and
stepping forwards again gave the Giant such a blow upon the helmet that he
cut away a great piece thereof together with the buckle that made it fast, but
although the blow was marvelous great, and in a manner incredible, yet was not
the Giant any thing therewith abashed, but still showed himself as fresh as if
he had not fought all the day long: Nevertheless the blood in such abundance
issued out of his body, that the white pauement of the court was changed into
red, and therewith he grew so weak, that it might easily be judged he had the
worst, whereby he still began to revile, seeking only to defend himself from
his enemies blows, whereat the old lady that beheld them, considering her
sons extremity, cried out and said, alas my child, is it possible I should
see thee murdered before my face, and therewith in great have she ran
thither, thinking to part them, but it was too late, for as she began to go
toward them, the Giant field a^ on the ground with two blows that the black
knight gave him, one upon the head where he was unarmed, the other right in the
middle of his leg, where with he cut it from his body, whereat the old lady
was so grieved that she swouned in the place, being by her Gentle women carried
from thence into her chamber, where they laid her on a bed, cursing him that
was the cause thereof, nevertheless he followed them to the chamber door,
where the old woman (being revived) perceiving him to enter, began again to
lament and mourn, and shedding great abundance of tears she said unto him.
Alas thou cruel knight the only bereauer of all my joy and felicity, art thou
not satisfied yet? But will thou like wise have my life and my sons both?
Then I pray thee with speed either execute thy will or else depart from hence,
and take what thou think good, permitting me to live the rest of my
miseraale days in sorrow and care, with these poor women: but all her intent
was to make him enter into the chamber, which was so inchaunted, that no man
could pass the threshold of the door, but presently he lost all his senses
and fell down v^on the ground, as if he were dead, but little did the
inchauntment ^^aile her against the black knight, because the shining sword
had such a property in it, that no enchantment whatsoever could hurt the
bearer thereof. Therefore the knight hearing the sorrow the old lady made, he
went into the chamber, speaking courteously unto her and said, Madame me
thinks you should take the offense I have committed on your behalf in much
better part, considering such hazards are common unto knights, desiring to win
honor, and therefore I pray you appease your sorrow, and show me the knight
you brought hither out of great Britain. When the old lady perceived him so
far within the chamber without let, and that he desired to see the king, she
being as it were out of her wits, cried as loud as she could, and said, alas
unhappy wretch that I am, what have I done, for thinking to revenge another
man's death, I have procured the destruction of mine own children, and
therewith she sighed in such manner as if her heart would burst within her
body, and lamenting yt absence of her other son, said: Alas Matroco, where art
thou now? What unhappy fortune has thus separated thee from thy brother and
me? Surely when thou hear of his death, and at thy return shall find
another lord of this castle, I am in doubt thou will not have the patience to
put up so great an injury, but thinking to revenge thy self I fear this
devil will handle thee in the like sort he has done the rest, for sure he is
no mortal man, for if he were he had found more resistance in this place
then he has done. Then speaking unto the knight she asked him if he knew the
man she held in prison, I truly (said he) it is king Lisuart, whereof I am
right sorry, being well assured that kings elected of God, (as he is) for the
government of his people ought not to be used in that manner. Wherefore I
would have you show me where he is, otherwise, I will do worse then I have
hitherto done. I know not (said she) who thou art, nor by what means thou have
so great power, but I am well assured and I would never have thought that
twenty such knights (as once this day I did esteem thee) could ever have
attained to the achieuing of so great an enterprice and much less to have
withstood my art as thou have done, so that considering thereof, I suppose that
this thy power proceeds from him in who^ in my young years I did once
believe, and since that have forsaken him, to follow the works of the common
enemy of all mankind, who according to his natural instinction, has justly
rewarded me to my desert: therefore it were but folly to deny thee any thing,
that art so surely defended by him to whom all things are obedient. Follow me
then (said she) and I will show thee the king, but as I think, it is not he
thou seek. And with that she rose up and went into a dark chamber, the
knight following her: then she opened an iron gate and said unto him go in,
and there shall thou find the prisoner. Lady (said the knight) if it were to
fight I would not fail to do your commandment, but if by subtlety I should
be shut in prison, you would laugh at me that I had no more wit but to put my
trust in you, wherefore go you in first, that whatsoever happens, you may
have your part, I see well (said the lady) that my labor is in vain, and all
my art is nothing in respect of thee, therefore I am content to do thy will,
but we have no light to see. Care you not for that (said he) for I will
provide you light, and with that he pulled of the taffata that covered the
scabberd of his sword, whereby there was so great a brightness in the place,
as if the sun had shone therein. Then they descended into a cave, where the
knight perceived king Luisart lie upon a couch of straw, with a great collar of
iron about his neck, and fetters on his legs, whereby he endured no little
pain, whereat he was so grieved, that for sorrow the tears ran down his
eyes, yet would he not disclose himself unto him, neither once utter what he
thought, but without making himself known, said unto him. Noble king, you
have been ouerlong within this filthy place, rise up I pray you and follow
me. When the king heard him speak in that manner, he made no other account
but to end his days at that time, wherewith he could not refrain to weep,
and speaking unto the old lady, asked her if she knew him: For (said he)
since I entered into this place, I never saw any knight nor any one that spoke
unto me, but that little sustenance I had was let down at a hole from the top
of this dungeon. The^ she answered him, and in great despite said, Thou
accursed king, if I had not known thee, I would never have taken pains to
fetch thee so far from hence as I have done, cursed be the time when first I
took it upon me, for thou only art the cause of my great sorrow, and the
sole instrument of my bereaved ioies. In faith lady (said the king) I know not
what you mean, and am very sorry for your heaviness, for I never sought but
to do honor and pleasure unto all ladies and Gentlewomen that desired the
same, and for them have I oftentimes enterprised many dangerous adventures, to
the great perrill and hazard of my life, and if it has happened otherwise unto
you it is altogether unknown to me and wholly against my will, wherefore I be
seech you be not offended with me but tell me where I am, and in whose power I
now remain a prisoner in so great misery, or by my soul I know it not,
neither can I so much as conceive which way I came into this place, only I
remember that to second a Gentlewoman yt a villain would have forced, I
entered into a tent, but what happened unto me after that I know not, but that
now I find my self lying on straw like a thief with yrons on my legs. King
(said she) the short time of thy continuance in this darkness has not satisfied
(as I well hoped it would) the great mischief I do wish thee, and that for
good cause, seeing that by thee only I have endured so much sorrow, that if
the heart and bowels were taken out of my body they would be found as burning
whote as flaming fire, and especially for the new displeasure I have now
conceived to see thee so soon delivered out of my hands, being in good hope by
thy long imprisonment to satisfy my losses past: but yet I am deceived, for
that fortune has now made me pay the usury of my forepassed ioies, having
given thee into my hands, from whence by the exquisite force of this devil
incarnate (thou art now delivered) who having put to death the Gardians of this
castle and slain mine own son, has constrained me to bring him unto thee,
which I never thought he could have done, much less that ever I should have
yielded unto his request, knowing the wrath of a woman not to have any bridle,
or means of mittigation until her desired revenge, has wrought the effect:
and so had it happened unto thee without ye force of this my enemy, but in
despite both of him and thee with mine own hands I will slay my self, if my
a^cursed fortune bereave me not the sooner of my wretched days, Cursed be
both thou and thy King, thou now have found (said she unto the knight,) Now
take him and do thy pleasure with him I pray you then lady (said he) unloose
his irons, and help me to lead him up, with that she took the keys out of
her pocket, and opened the locks of his chains, whereby the King rose up upon
his feet, and embracing ye black Knight, said unto him, What great good or
pleasure sir Knight did I ever do you, whereby you should purchase this
liberty unto me? By my soul I swear, that besides the honor you have
obtained in this place, you have so much bound me unto you, that during my life
I shall never forget your courtesy, wherefore if you love me let me know your
name. Noble King (said ye knight) whosoever I am, I account my self happy if
many sort I may be able to do you service, as for the rest pardon me if it
pleases you, and let us go out of this cave, thanking God, that oftentimes
sends scourges unto those he loves, as in his heavenly wisdom he thinks
convenient, thereby to keep them in obedience unto him. The King pecreiuing
well by ye knights words that he desired not to be known, and for the same
cause kept his helmet on his head, therefore he determined not to move him
any more, but with that they went all three out of the cave, and came into a
goodly hall, when the sun began to go down.

CHAP. V. How that after King Luisart was delivered out of prison, Matroco
(Frerions elder brother) with his ships, arrived at the foot of the rock
called La Roche defendu, and of the battle between the said Matroco and the
black knight.
KIng Luisart, the black knight, and the lady being entered into the hall, as
they looked out at the windows into the sea, there entered a Gentlewoman, and
doing reverence unto the lady, she said, Madame, your son Matroco with his
ships is even now arrived at the foot of the rock, and with him great numbers
of other vessels, yt he has taken upon the seas, What is your pleasure to say
unto him? When the lady heard her she waxed pale, and with tears in her
eyes, answered her and said, I would to God he were as far from hence as he
is near: for my heart gives me he will speed in the like manner that others
have done before him, And as she spoke, king Luisart and the knight looked
into the sea, and perceiving the Giants fleet surging on the shore out of wind
and weather, among the which they knew Elizabeth Libee his nephue, and diverse
others yt were bound in chains, making great sorrow, but none of Matrocos men
durst set foot on land, having already ben advertised by some of the castle, of
the great misfortune happened therein, and for the same cause stayed so long
without, till the Giant espied at the windows the knight and ye king looking
upon them, wherewith in a great rage he cried unto the black knight whom he
perceived all armed, and said unto him: Thou accursed slave is it thou that so
cowardly has slain my uncle, my brother, and the porter of my castle? When
the knight heard him, he answered him and said, I have done my endeavor to make
thee know, that it belongs not to such as thou art either to imprison kings,
or to molest and grieve so many men as continually thou do. By all my gods
(said Matroco) fortune favors thee too much, when at my arrival I find
thee armed with the walls of this my castle, for if I had thee here upon the
shore, I would soon send thee fishing into the sea as I have done many other
rash and bold fools like thy self, that have enterprised without cause to
enforce my castle, but if I continue here ten years together, I will never
depart hence till I have thee in my hands, then shall thou know how I use to
handle such as thou art. Stay a while (said ye black knight) there is much more
difference between saying and doing, then there is distance of place between
thee and me. Thy threatenings make me more assured, wherefore now I fear thee
lesser then I did before, and that thou may well know it to be so, take thy
choice whether I shall come down to fight with thee, or thou come up to me.
Then shall thou plainly see to whom God will give the victory, either to thee
yt trustest in thine own strength, or to me, that trust only in him. The
greatest oxen and fattest bulls are oftentimes brought unto the slaughter as
well as lesser beasts. So thou great beast, I advise thee to remember thy
former life before worse happen unto thee, forsaking thy accursed faith which
thou now hold, and with might maintainest, otherwise be thou assured the
wrath of God will fall upon thee, as it has already done upon thy friends.
That shall be seen (said Matroco) and if thou have the courage to stay for
me, I assure thee, thou will be glad to deny the villainous words thou now
have uttered. Therefore cause the gate to be opened, for seeing thou put
me to my choice, I will come up to thee, were it into the dungeon, from whence
thou have delivered that villain standing by thee, and therewith leaving his
company behind him, being all armed, he began to mount up the rock, and went
unto the castle, but when he came to the iron gate, (which he found open,
because the watch had left it and were gone) and saw Argantes lying dead, he
was in a manner out of his wits, not so much for the prowess he knew to be in
him, as that he had from his youth been nourished and bred up in the castle by
the Giant his father. Nevertheless he dissembled his grief, hoping to be
revenged at his pleasure, and going further, in another place he found the
Giant armed all in green, dead and freshly bleeding, wherewith he was so
moved, that he stayed and stood still, and casting forth a great sigh, began to
cry out and said, alas Arcalaus my good uncle, how near does the loss of
thee go to my heart, wheresoever it had happened, but especially being done
within mine own castle, wherein I thought long time to live and make merry with
thee: Alas is fortune so cruel unto thee, that after so many travails and
dangerous adventures, with infinite perils, that in the flower of thy youth
thou have sustained, thou must in thine old years come and receive so cruel a
death within my house, which I esteemed as an assured hold and defense, not
only for me, but for thee and the rest of our kindred and friends? O immortal
gods, what vengeance can I take upon the Traitor that has so much offended me,
seeing that to cause him to die each day a hundred times were nothing in
respect of the mischief he has done unto me? At the least if it were Amadis
de Gaul, so much esteemed of all men or any of his two brethren, or all they
three together, my grief would be somewhat eased by reason of the sorrows I
would cause them to endure. But what? Now I am constrained to fight against one
alone, who by reason considring the travel he has taken all this day, ought
already to esteem himself overcome and vanquished: What glory then can I
obtain by winning victory against him? Trewly as much as if I fought against a
simple woman, being (as by nature she is) both weak and feeble, so he
unworthy of my presence will be much prowder if I do but make a countenance
to fight with him: nevertheless what blot soever may happen unto mine honor,
of force he must die. In this manner did the Giant lament over the body of
Arcalaus his dead uncle, not moving from thence, till at last he perceived the
black knight that stood to hear him, wherewith being somewhat ashamed he
marched toward him, thinking without hinderance to enter into the dungeon, but
he found the black knight at the gate that boldly thrust him back, and said
unto him, Thou brutish and unreasonable beast, think thou to enter in by
force? Whereat the Giant all abashed, stayed without and said, Thou biddest me
to come up, have I the^ done thee wrong to come at thy commandment? No (said
the knight) but beholding thy countenance, it seems thou would enter by
authority, and therewith stepping aside, he said: Now come in and do what
thou can. When the old woman (with whom king Luisart talked) perceived the^
ready to fight, in great fear she ran out of the hall, and fell down at her
sons feet, crying out and said, alas Matroco, I pray thee, and by the duty a
child owes unto the mother I command thee not to enter into this combat, for
thou know well that of all thy brethren, thou art only left alive,
wherewith my heart is so grieved, that had it not been for the love I bear
thee, thou had found me now at thy return in as pitiful estate as thou
see thy brother Frerion: neither is there any woman at this present living in
the world, that ought (with better reason) to wish for death then I. Alas what
fortune is this, that now again I must renew the sorrows, which both time and
long patience (as I thought) had buried in obliuiuion? Alas miserable woman
that I am, I only have forged the weapon that has given the wound, whereby at
this present I receive this dommage, for upon the day of my husbands decease,
thinking to revenge the grief that my soul sustained, I have to the contrary
advanced mine own shame and utter ruin, justly receiving the reward that
belongs unto such, as refusing the better part think to remedy one mischief
by procuring a worse upon themselves. Madame (said the Giant) if at this
present you have received great loss by the death of some of your friends,
nevertheless you ought not to take it so offensiuely, seeing they have ended
their days in honorable combat, as behooves all worthy knights such as they
were. And as for me, think you that for fear of death I will refuse to do
that whereunto by knighthood I am bound? No, no: likewise what reason or what
excuse should move me, being as I am both fresh and well disposed, to refuse the
combat alone against one simple knight? I deny not madame, but confess that
affection causes you to use these words, and show the nature of a woman: but
you must conceive and think with your self that I answer you as it becomes
me, preferring mine honor before your tears, wherefore I beseech you suffer
me to take the small vengeance I can upon the villain that has so much
offended me. Matroco (said the knight) thou reckonest before thine host, I
would not for all the gold in the world lose such an occasion offered as I now
have, both for mine honor and advantage. Believe me, that neither thy mothers
tears, nor the duty thou owe unto her (as being her child) can by any means
prolong the end of thee or me, if without dissimulation thou do not by oath
promise and assure me to live in as good sort from this time f^rwards as in
times past thou have lived wickedly. Wherefore it were better for thee to make
me know by effect the Prowess thou vauntest thy self to have, and for me to
let thee see the courtesy, which it may be thou shall find at my hands if I
overcome thee. When ye lady perceived that her prayers could take no place she
left them, and the two knights began to run one upon the other so bravely and
with such fury, that king Luisart beholding them thought he never saw so cruel
a battle, and ye which abashed him more was, that he could not presume how or
in what manner the black Knight had found him in so strange a place, and yet
he knew him not: sometime he thought him to be Amadis, but when he remembered
the love he bare unto the lady Oriana that he had newly married, he was
otherwise persuaded, and likewise he remembered very well the combats he had
seen Amadis de Gaul make at Windsore against Dardan le Superbe, and after
that with Ardan Canile, wherein he used all his forces, yet were they not
comparable to those of the black knights: who as then found himself as fresh
and well disposed to fight as if he had not fought all the day before. Again
when he thought it to be his nephew Esplandian, for that Vrganda had foreshewed
many wonderful things of him, he was soon dissuaded from that opinion by
reason he left him with the queen his mother, not once seeking to receive the
order of knighthood, and although that since his departure out of Britain he
might have obtained that honor, yet did he esteem it impossible for
Esplandian to do so valiantly at the first. Further Vrganda had always
prophesied of him that the first valiant acts he should atchieue should be
renowned and spoken of by his strange and fearful navigations in the great
serpent, wherein he should be embarked, and for the black knight he knew he
arrived there in a little bark unfurnished, whereby he esteemed it unlikely to
be his nephew Esplandian. But he thought he never had seen so valiant and
hardy a knight, for the longer he fought, the more he wearied and labored
Matroco. Nevertheless he continued fighting for the space of two hours
together before it could be judged who should have the victory, but in the end
the Giant feeling himself wounded in so many places (his armor altogether
broken, and his shield half cloven in two) began to mistrust his own force.
Wherefore stepping back he stayed his hand, and said: Knight I pray thee* let
us breath our selves a while, and hear what I will offer thee, which cannot be
other then to thy honor and advantage. With that the knight stood still, and
Matroco began to speak, saying: I wonder (sir knight) what moved thee to
venture in this manner upon this rock, wherein never any but thy self durst
enterprise to come during my fathers life, neither yet sithence that by his
death I have been lord thereof, and besides this thy enterprise, wherein thou
have done the thing that all others feared to do before thee, tho^ ^^st also
slain three of my friends, whereof two of them as I think were the best
knights in their time living on the earth, whereby I have just cause to hate
thee more then any man living. But when I call to mind that thou have done
therein like a valiant and hardy knight, I have some reason to pardon thee, and
to esteem thee for one of the valiantest champions that ever I saw in all my
life, although I have both proved and vanquished many others longer practiced
in arms, and stronger then thy self. Wherefore if the only cause of thy
arrival in this place was to deliver the king that looks on us, I am content
thou take and lead him hence in safety, and for the same cause likewise I quite
thee of the combat, upon condition that without long soiourning here, thou
shall presently depart out of this castle that belongs unto me. When the
black knight had heard him, he answered him and said, Giant, as far as I
perceive thou esteemest it a great enterprise yt I have done to come hither and
find thee here within thy castle, where by me those that thou so much
lamentest have been slain, but if thou knew the master that I serve, to
whom as duty binds me I am obedient, thou should presently perceive and
plainly see, this enterprise by thee esteemed much, to be nothing in
comparison of that he is able to do and bring to pass, for that from him
only and none other proceeds all whatsoever I have done, whereby of good
right the glory belongs unto him: and to the contrary you that are idolaters,
serve those that are accustomed to rock and lul you asleep in all kind of
vices, cruelties, outrages, thefts, murders; and infinite other wickedness,
which for a time do prosper with you, whereby you live in honor, riches, and
all worldly pleasures, and so are nulled in all filthiness, but surely such
manner of life may well be compared to buildings erected upon the sands, that
cannot ^ontinue long, but are most sure to have an evil end, even then ^hen
they are esteemed to be at the top of all their worldly felicity* Like as it
happened unto Lucifer and his fellswes, whereof it may be thou have heard
spoken. Nevertheless if thou will acknowledge thy former life, and of a wicked
wretch (as thou have always lived) become a virtuous knight, and as thou have
been m^^ cruel and inhumane, become courteous and pitiful, forsaking thy
vain and foolish faith to believe in my God, who is the most true and mighty
Lord of all lords, I will not only pardon thee the combat whereof thou have the
worst, but will leave thee thy castle free unto thy self, and so will be thy
friend, upon condition nevertheless, that from henceforth both thou and I
shall employ our forces to overthrow and destroy all those, that (as thy self)
do walk in darkness, from whence (if you wilt believe me) thou shall come
out. This answer of the black knight moved the Giant in such manner, that
like a wild Bear he began to foam at the mouth, and said unto the knight.
Thou accursed wretch, and of all others the most vile, do thou so little
esteem my force that thou think me already overcome and vanquished? And
there with he pulled away the pieces of his shield that hung about his neck,
and threw them on the ground, and taking his sword in both his hands, he
struck at the black knight, thinking to cleave his head, but he perceiving
the stroke, stepped under the blow, and closed with the Giant, whereby the
sword passing over his head, hit upon the pauement with so great force that it
brake in pieces, and therewith the pummell fell out of his hand, so that the
two knights being closed together, could not hurt one the other but with their
fists or pummels of their swords, whereby the black knight much grieved the
Giant, before he could find the means to recover the handle of his sword,
but in the end he found means to unloose himself from the knight, and as he
reculed back, shunning the fury of his enemy, the old woman seeing her son
in so great danger, went between them, and ^^^^ing most bitterly, said unto
the knight: alas Gentleman if ever you came of woman, or have compassion of a
poor widows estate, I beseech you for the honor of him in whom you believe
to pity my misery, and leaving me this only son, content your self with the
death of those, that most cruelly you have slain before my face. Lady (said
the knight) then cause him to ask mercy, and he shall find it in me,
otherwise you labor but in vain. To ask mercy of thee (said the Giant) I
can never be dishonored thereby, knowing it by experience to be most true,
that such power and strength as I find in thee, comes not from thy self, but
proceeds and is only caused by the favor of thy God, for without his help
thou had no more ben able to endure against me, then straw against the
flaming fire, therefore it were great folly in me to fight both against God
and man, but I had rather (perceiving my end to approach) ask him mercy and
forgiveness, then believe any longer in those in whom I have hitherto put my
trust, whereof I am right sorry, so that whether I fight or sight not, or
whether I live or die I protect and make a vow from henceforth never to worship
other then Jesus Christ thy Lord and master. Meanest thou as thou say
(said the knight?) I truly answered Matroco, and therewith kneeling on the
ground, and lifting both his eyes and hands unto heaven, he cried out and
said, Jesus the son of the virgin Mary, I most certainly believe thee to
be the only infalible true and living God, and that all others whom during my
life I have worshipped and adored, are of no power, wherefore forsaking their
false doctrine to worship thee according to thy holy law, I most humbly beseech
thee to be merciful unto me: and making the sign of the cross upon the
ground, he stooped down and kissed it. Which the black knight beholding, for
joy thanked God with all his heart, and taking his sword by the point presented
the handle to Matroco, saying unto him: Truly valiant knight, among so many
triumphant victories yt in times past you have obtained, there never happened
any one so honorable as this, for that herein you have not only vanquished
me, but your self also, that for strength of body are invincible: wherefore as
a victorious knight, I present my sword unto you. It shall not be so (said
Matroco) but the contrary, for I being vanquished submit my self unto your
pleasure, and from this time forwards dispose of me, my goods and honor, as
you shall think convenient. I pray you then (said the black knight) have
pity upon the poor prisoners that even now I saw bound within your galleys,
and let them be sent for hither, that I might speak with them: Withal my
heart (said the Giant) and therewith calling his mother, said unto her,
Madame, I pray you send down unto the ships to fetch the prisoners that the
knight desires to see, and let none of my men set foot on land till I send
them further commission, which she presently did. But when master Elizabeth
Libee, and the rest of the prisoners heard the message, they made no little
sorrow, thinking the best comfort they could have would be a most miserable and
cruel imprisonment, but when they entered the first gate of the castle, where
the porter and Arcalaus lay dead, they were somewhat revived, and in better
hope then at the first, specially when they saw the black knight that came to
meet them, who without making himself known to any but to master Elizabeth,
took him by the hand, and said unto him: My good friend, because I will not
that any but you alone shall know who I am, I pray you in the morning come and
visit me in an Hermitage that stands at the foot of this hill, where I will
stay for you, in the mean time you shall find king Luisart in the castle, who
I leave behind me, but as you love your life, be secret and tell him not who I
am. Master Elizabeth was much abashed when he knew him to be Esplandian, and
willingly would have had more conference with him, had it not been for ye
charge he had given him before, as also that at the same time a Gentlewoman
came unto him and said. Sir knight, if ever you will see Matroco alive, make
have and come unto him, for he is even now fallen upon the ground, and (as I
think is dead) he has lost so much of his blood. Go (said he) to master
Elizabeth, and help him what you can, for your help will do him more pleasure
at this time then my presence can comfort him, wherewith he left master
Elizabeth with the Gentlewoman, and went unto the Hermitage, where the night
before he had lodged, but he got not thither before the son went down, being
so weary and sore with fighting all the day that he could not go further:
where he found the Hermit and the dumb man sitting together, by whom he was
presently unarmed, and meat set before him, for all that day he had not eaten,
and having supped, they laid him in a bed, where the Hermites daughter when
she came to see her father used to lie, and visiting his body to see if he
were hurt, they found it much bruised and black in diverse places, but not
wounded by reason of the goodness of his armor, which no sword or other
weapon could pierce, then they anointed him with certain ointments that
appeased the soreness of his bruses, wherewith he fell on sleep till the
next morning.

CHAP. VI. Of the great displeasure king Luisart took for the departure of the
black knight, and what conference he had with Arcabonne mother to Matroco,
touching her unfortunate life.
THe black knight being departed out of the castle he had newly conquered, and
the prisoners entered therein, among the rest king Luisart knew master
Elizabeth, wherefore he rose up (sitting by Arcabonne, Matrocos mother, who as
then leaned on her lap) and went to embrace him, asking him what fortune had
brought him thither at yt time to save the Giants life, being in so great
extremity? And it pleases your grace (said he) once this day I did not think
he would have had so much need of my help as he now has: But as I understand
by a knight that I met going down the hill, he is in great danger of his
life: Nevertheless for the honor of him that commanded me to help him, I
will do the best I can. I pray you do so (said the king.) Then master
Elizabeth caused Matroco to be softly laid upon his bed, and being unarmed
searched his wounds, and perceiving them to be deadly, would not for that time
do any thing unto them but stanch their bleeding, leaving the rest till he
had slept, wherein he was newly fallen. In the mean time king Luisart not
forgetting what master Elizabeth at his coming in had said unto him, asked
him what was become of the black knight: and it pleases your grace (said he)
as we entered into ye castle, I met him going secretly from hence, and not
minding to return again. By Saint Mary (said the king) have I received so
great aid at his hands, and am I so unfortunate, that he should depart from
hence without knowing him? Truly I am sorry, I stayed here to see what would
become of Matroco, if I had not I would surely have followed him, and with much
importunity have craved his name. Master Elizabeth (said he) will you upon
your faith tell me truly whether you know him or not? If it be so, if you will
do do me any pleasure, hide it no longer from me, for I never had so great
desire to know any knight, not only for the aid he has done me, but for the
valiant enterprise at this present achieved by him. Your grace shall pardon
me^ if it pleases you, said master Elizabeth, for it is true that I know him
well, but if I tell you any more, I should do him wrong, for he has expressly
forbidden me to do it. I see well (said the king) you will but increase the
desire I have to k^^w him, and that is worse, by the same means bereave me of
all hope ever to see him again. With yt they entered into the hall, where they
met Arcabonne half dead with sorrow, whom the king in courteous manner prayed
to stay a while, asking her how her son did. He does (said she) as one in
whom I have as little hope of life as of the other that lies dead in the
court, and to say ye truth, it seems that fortune has wholly bent her self
against me, not ceasing continually to heap sorrow upon sorrow to make me
desperate. Notwithstanding I know full well how to be revenged, and that is, in
despite of her and her cruelties to bereave my self of life whereby she
shall lose her power, which by good reason I cannot well prolong, seeing she
has not spared me one hour of rest since she first began, still playing her
part in tormenting me, but of all other my misfortunes, none has grieved me
so much as the force of this knight, by whose power (said she unto the king) I
see thee now delivered out of my hands, and from the cruel torments I had
prepared for thee, if accursed fortune had not withstood them. Madame (said
the king) I pray you declare unto me the cause of this your great malice
toward me, and whether at any time I have done you wrong or injury whereby I
should deserve it: that will I show thee, said Arcabonne, not therein to do
thee pleasure, but rather to grieve thee more when thou shall know and
understand that I was borne and bred in the same country, wherein to my great
despite thou have reigned ouerlong, for there I and Arcalaus my brother by
father and mother, were both begotten and brought up in the art of Nigromancy,
which oftentimes we have practiced and put in effect, therewith to torment
diverse persons that never did offend us. In the which art, as age and knowledge
increased, I growing very expert, in the end became acquainted with Cartadaque,
as then lord of this castle, with whom I grew in so great familiarity, that he
married me, and with him ever fithence have dwelt here in this castle, where
not long after I was delivered of a son called Lindoraque, after that of
another named Matroco, that now lies in this bed, and lastly of the third
called Frerion, whom thou have slain, and my brother also, that went to help
Argantes the Porter of this castle. And being thus married unto such a husband
as Cartadaque, was so much feared and redoubted in all places, and having three
of the most valiant and worthy knights to my sons, that ever lived, I was so
elevated in pride, and so little esteemed of cruel fortune, that I thought it
impossible for her to work me any woe. But by tract of time I found it
otherwise, for by little and little she has wholly changed my joy into most
grievous sorrow, and will thou know how? Then I think thou do yet remember
the discord that long sithence happened between thee and Childadan king of
Ireland, and of the battle wherein thou ouercammest him, where my deceased
husband minding to be present, expressly departed from hence thither, and as
accursed fortune would, took my son Lindoraque with him, and having
travailed many countries, at the last arrived at the place where my brother
stayed for them, travailing all three together with full purpose and intent to
do thee all the injury they could, and they had scarce entered into a forest
not far from London, but they met a knight as then surnamed Le Beautenebreux,
riding in company of a Gentlewoman, that ware on her head a Call all set with
strange flowers, whom my son (as accursed fortune would) liked so well, that
with a great desire to have her to present unto the Lady Madasine his love,
commanded one of his squires to go fetch her to him, which the knight called Le
beau tenebreux, whereof I speak, would not permit, but sent the messenger back
again well beaten, wherewith my son being moved, thought to have her by
force, but it fell out otherwise for him, for at the first encounter the knight
with one blow with his sword, thrust him into the body, whereof he died, and
as much had chanced to his uncle Arcalaus, if his horse had not saved him by
running away, having first lost four of his fingers on the right hand. Yet
fortune not contenting her self with this mischief, prepared me a worse, for
my husband (who for his valor and prowes was feared and redoubted throughout
all Asia and Europe) was cruelly slain by ye same murderer of Lindoraque,
upon the same day the battle was fought, if thou can remember it, whereby
ever sithence I remained a widow with my other sons as the^ very young and
tender of age, with whom I have passed the greatest part of my days most
extremely, weeping and lamenting with continual sadness, which had been more
grievous unto me, had it not ben for the hope I conceived of their valor and
prowess. But to come to the point of my discourse, time and reason having in a
manner suppressed my forepassed sorrows, news was brought me of the last victory
thou did obtain by the Prowess of the knight named Le beautenebreux (now
as it is said, called Amadis de Gaul) and likewise of my brothers
imprisonment, wherewith I was so grieved, that respecting not my old years, I
took upon me to travail into Britain, hoping by some means to get him out
of thy hands. But before I arrived there, I had certain news of his delivery,
nevertheless considering with my self the forepassed injuries I have received
by thy kinsmen, namely by that wicked wretch Amadis de Gaul, I determined
before my return hither to find the means to make him know that small good
will I bear him. But having employed all my art, and finding it in vain to
work any further therein against him, by reason of a ring he bears daily on
his finger, given him by that wicked enchauntresse Vrganda: I determined to
prove my skill (which could not take effect in him) against thee, being
advertised of thy often riding to hunt, with very few in thy company, where I
made thee see one of my Gentlewomen and a villain that would defloure her,
whom thou thoughtest to succor, and if thou now remembrest me, I am the very
same thou foundest in the pauillion, following after him that fled before thee,
and there thou remainedst inchaunted, from whence we carried thee into our
bark, and without knowledge unto any but mine own servants, thou wast brought
hither by sea, with full deliberation to cause thee languish in prison: in the
mean time with the help of my allies and friends, thy country should be
invaded, but I find my self deceived. For that this place (which never was
conquered by any power whatsoever the kings of Turkey, or the Emperors of
Constontinople could ever bring against it, in less then one day is both
conquered and taken by one simple knight, with the loss of my two sons, and
others, esteemed Paragons among the best knights in the world, whereby it may
clearly be perceived, that by means of thy captivity there is much more
mischief happened unto me then sorrow to thy person. While Arcabonne made
this long discourse, the king that still beheld her in the face, remembered well
it was she to whom he spoke in the pauillion, wherefore he said unto her, In
good faith madame I now believe you better then at the first, yet me thinks
you do me wrong to make me bear the burden of another man's offense.
Think thou so (said she?) No truly, for thy imprisonment only had wrought
great damage unto diverse men, but to me and mine great profit and advantage. It
might be so (answered the king) notwithstanding I will not cease to do you all
the favor and pleasure that I can. In the mean time I pray you take your
adversity with as great constancy as you may. By my soul (said she) thou
speak at thy pleasure, and therewith in a great fury (she went into
Matrocos chamber) leaving the king that had not eaten all that day, wherefore
he called master Elizabeth and the other company, that mean time had
prepared his meat, and sitting down to supper, they discoursed of the talk
he and Arcabonne had together, till it was time to go to rest, when the king
went to bed, leaving Libee to guard the castle.

CHAP. VII. How the Giant Matroco died, whereat Arcabonne was in such a fury,
that having failed to kill King Luisart, she threw her self headlong out of a
window into the sea.
KIng Luisart was not fully asleep, but he was forced to awake by means of a
cry of women that he heard, making great lamentation, wherefore starting up,
and calling master Elizabeth and the rest of his company, he took a hatchet
which he had laid under the bolster of his bed, and went to see what it meant,
and as he passed through the hall, he perceived Arcabonne coming toward him
(covered only with a mantle) wringing her hands and tearing her hair, making
great sorrow. Wherewith the king went to her, asking her what she meant? Alas
(said she) that which I most feared, and ever sithence yesterday most assuredly
expected is fallen out: and as she uttered those words she pulled out a naked
sword that she bare under her arm, wherewith she meant to kill the king. But
as fortune would, he perceived ye blow coming, and stepped aside, and with the
force of the blow the sword hitting upon the pauement, fell out of the old
woman's hands, wherewith the king stepped upon it, and when he stooped to take
up, Arcabonne perceiving the chamber door where master Elizabeth was, to be
open, she ran thither, and threw herself out at a window into the sea: the
king followed her not, but went into the chamber where Matroco lay, and
perceiving him to be dead, came forth again into the hall, where he met
master Elizabeth, that told him news of Arcabonnes death. In good truth
(said he) there is no extremity like to that of a woman, behold I pray you
with what fury she was possessed, for as I issued out of the chamber, I met
her, and thinking with fair speeches and good persuasions to comfort her, she
failed not much to kill me with this sword that I have in my hand: and as they
beheld it, the king knew it to be the same he wore when he was inchaunted,
which pleased him so well, that he said, Ha good sword, the best and
faithfullest companion that ever man had, how many victories have I had by thy
means, and what combats and adventures have I brought to an end with thy
help? And by great misfortune having lost thee, thou knew me, for being in
a mad woman's hands, that with thee would have slain me, thou have not only
denied her that favor, but have fallen out of her hands to return again unto
him that never (while his arm is able to welde thee) will forsake thee. Now
(said he to Libee) if we chance to be assaulted, we have wherewith to defend
us. Truly (said master Elizabeth) I believe all those that could hurt us in
this place, are either dead or fled away, wherefore I am of opinion in the
morning to bury them that are slain, mean time expecting some means whereby
we may return into your graces country, we will enquire what is become of the
black knight that you so much desire to know. You shall do well (said the king)
and therewith each man went to rest til the morning, ye master Elizabeth and
others of his company went to bury the Porter and the rest of ye dead knights,
among ye which they knew Arcalaus the inchaunter, that not fifteen days before
had arrived in the castle, for at his delivery out of prison, being advertised
of king Luisarts sudden departure, he suspected his sister Arcabonne had
stolen him away, and therefore came expressly to the castle armed in green
as you have heard, and although master Elizabeth had seen him oftentimes
before, yet at the first sight he doubted it was he, considering where not
long before he had left him, wherefore he sent to tell the king, that
presently came to see him, who knew him well, yet I thought (said he) he had
still ben prisoner in the Ferme isle, and it pleases your grace (said master
Elizabeth) he was delivered from thence before my departure, and therewith
showed him the means how, as it is at large declared in the end of our fourth
book. Behold (said the king) how great are the judgments of God: let his body
be put into some cold place, for I am well assured that his soul shall endure
much more heat then ever it had in this world.

CHAP. VIII. How master Elizabeth went to find the black knight in the
Hermitage, and what conference they had.
ARcalaus and the rest being buried, king Luisart went into his chamber, and as
he looked into the sea, he could not see the ships that Matroco brought
with him, wherefore inquiring which way they went, he was certefied, that when
Arcabonne threw her self out of the window into the sea, they took up her
dead body, and laying it in their vessels, hoised sails, and put to sea. Let
the^ go to the devil (said the king) and we to dinner if there be any thing
to eat, your dinner is ready (said master Elizabeth) when it pleases your
grace to sit down: wherewith the meat was brought in, and the king eat with a
good appetite, but he had taken so little rest the night before, that as he
sat at the table he fell asleep. Wherefore rissng up, he laid him down on his
bed, commanding his men not to wake him, wherewith master Elizabeth was well
pleased, knowing that in the mean time he might have convenient leisure to go
unto Esplandian as he had promised, whereupon he departed secretly out of the
castle, and going down the hill, went so long, that he came to the Hermitage,
where he found the Hermit and the dumb man sitting at the door, and he
saluting them, asked if the black knight were there, the Hermit said no, but
the dumb man made signs that he should go into the chamber, which he did,
where he found him very melancholy lying upon a bed* But when he perceived
master Elizabeth he took him by the hand and said, My good friend master
Elizabeth you are welcome hither, tell me I pray you how you left the Ferme
Isle in this manner to serve Matroco and his barbarous companions? Wherewith he
laughed, for the Giant had tied him to a chain^, and ^ade him row in his
Galleys as other slaves did. My lord (said master Elizabeth) when you received
the order of knighthood, and that king B^uneo, Quedragant, and al our company
that were as then with your father Amadis de Gaul, slept by means of the
melodious noise of nine trumpets yt sounded on the shore, Grasinde my
mistress sent me on a message to the Marquess Saluder her brother, to
certefie him of her marriage with the Prince of Sansuegue: wherefore I embarked
my self, and had so good a wind, that in short time after I arrived at
Constantinople, where I found the Emperor, that took great pleasure to hear
me discourse what had happened sithence the return of Gastilles his nephew.
And the next day when I meant to return, the Princess Leonorine who in my mind
is the beautifullest Princess living at this time, sent for me, most
instantly desiring me that in the presence of queen Minoresse with diverse
other ladies and Gentlewomen, I would show her what I had heard touching the
knight with the green sword. For (said she) although yt now we understand he
is named Amadis de Gaul, yet will we not change his other name, till such time
he sends us some other of his lineage, or else return himself to do us
service, according to his promise. The^ I showed them of ye strangeness of the
Arc of lovers, the singularities of the Isle, whereof they never had heard,
the loss of king Luisart, the manner how you received the order of knighthood,
the ceremonies that at the same time Vrganda commanded to be used, the
commandment that your father Amadis de Gaul gave you to come and serve them
in this place, and lastly how in the end we fell asleep in the great serpent,
from whence we were carried, (not knowing thereof) to the palace of Apolidon,
where when we awaked we found all our company together, (only you,) Manely,
the king of Denmark, Ambor, and Talanque, not knowing what was become of you.
And while I made this long discourse, the Princess Leonorine would not suffer
me to make an end, qut interrupting me in my tale, said unto me: Master
Elizabeth, when my cousin Gastilles returned from thence, I remember that among
other things by him declared, he said something touching the young gentleman
whereof you speak; wherefore I pray you show us what you know of him: wherein
seeking to fulfill her request, I began to show her the manner of your
nativity, how king Luisart found you in the forest with the lions, of the
letters he received that day, what letters you had on your body when you were
borne, whereof some were as white as Snow, signifying your own name, the rest
as red as blood, showing the name of your love, as yet unknown, by reason the
car^acters cannot be understood. Then smilingly she asked me how you would
know it, and I answered her, that love in time would learn, and that for
certain she should be of royal blood, and one that should be the beautifullest
lady living in her time. Truly (said she) he deserves no less, wherefore I
pray you heartely when you see him, persuade him to come hither and fulfill the
promise that his father made us, for I have great desire to see him, that he
might be as much at our commandment, as heretofore his father Amadis has
been, which I promised her to do, although I said I doubted it would not be
so soon as I could wish. So my lord I stayed certain days at Constantinople,
speaking continually of you, that done, I embarked my self again, where by
evil fortune we fell into the hands of the Giant Matroco, who as then was
upon the sea. While master Elizabeth showed the black knight of the beauty of
the Princess Leonorine, and what she had inquired of him, love entered so
far into his heart, that oftentimes he changed color, but for ye time he
covered his intent as much as he could: and entering into another matter,
asked master Elizabeth how he found the means to leave king Luisart, As well
as I would wish (said he) for as soon as he had dined, he lay down to
sleep, in the mean time I came hither to you. I pray you (said the knight)
let him know nothing touching me. And wherefore (said master Elizabeth) will
you hide your self from him, Seeing there is no Prince living in the world,
worthier then he to be honored and served of all good knights? It is true
(said the knight) but I have done so little as yet, that I am ashamed he
should bear no better news of me, seeing I am in hope, that in time I shall
do great matters, which of themselves will set forth my renown, without the
praise of other men. Seeing it is your pleasure (said master Elizabeth) I will
do so, although it would rejoice him much, to hear that such unexpected aid
should come unto him only by your means. That shall be at another time
(said the knight) and not now: Wherefore least he should miss you when he a
makes, I pray you return unto the castle, and when you see convenient time,
come hither again to visit me. Wherewith master Elizabeth took his leave,
bidding him farewell, and went the same way he came toward the castle.

CHAP. IX. How Carmelle the Hermites daughter found the black Knight sleeping
in the Hermitage, and thinking to kill him, perceiving him so fair, she fell
in love with him.
Master Elizabeth gone from the Hermitage where he left the black knight,
went so fast and made such have, that he came again unto the castle, not
missed of any, yet the king was awake before he came, who leaning in a window,
and seeing him below in the court, asked him if he had slept, No, and it
likes your grace (said he) I have been abroad, walking along the country,
which I find enuironned with the goodliest meddowes that ever were seen, come
up hither (said the king) and we will talk with you, but he was no sooner
entered into the chamber, when Carmelle the Hermites daughter came to the king,
and kneeling down before him, said, May it please your grace to entertain me
into your service, that am one of your natural subjects, and will be during
life: wherewith the king took her up and said, Gentlewoman, if you desire any
thing at my hands, assure your self it shall not be denied, for I did never
during my life but honor and pleasure such as you are, and although such
savors have oftentimes turned to my great trouble, therein do I blame no man
but my self, for that God justly sends hat^ g^^^ and evil, when, where, and
to whom it pleases him, wherefore I pray you show me who you are. Then
Carmelle made a long discourse, how from her youth upwards she had served her
mistress Arcabonne, and what occasion moved her father to become an Hermit,
as you heard before. Truly Gentlewoman (said the king) if you will return into
great Britain, I will take you with me. I will do (said she) what your
grace commands: in the mean time I pray you grant me leave to give my father
intelligence who you are, for he will be most ready and glad to do your grace
service. With a good will (said the king) and tell him I desire to see him,
wherewith Carmelle thanked his grace, and because it was late, she went again
into her chamber till the next morning that she rose, and issuing out of the
castle, about break of the day went down a certain path she ordinarily used
to go, whereby she came into the Hermitage at such time as the Hermit and
the dumb man were gone to the bark to fetch such necessaries as the black
knight wanted, who in the mean time slept in his bed, for after that master
Elizabeth had given him intelligence what the Princess Leonorine had said, he
could not rest, till the very same time when she entered into her fathers
cell, wherein she found him, and not doubting any thing went into the chamber,
where she heard the black knight snort, wherewith being abashed she opened
the window and perceived him asleep, his sword hanging at his beds head, which
she ^^^e down, and softly drew out of the scabberd, finding it freshly posted
with blood, whereupon she suspected it was he that had slain Frerion, Matroco,
and others in the castle, and as she looked about her she knew his black
armor, wherewith she was in such a fear, that she had almost fallen down,
and let the swor^ fall out of her hands, but taking courage, she went nearer to
the b^d, to know him better, being fully determined if it were he ^kill him as
he lay, and therewith began by little and little to uncover his face, but he
showed so fair, that suddenly the fury she had, changed into so burning a
love, that during her life it was never quenched, in such manner that the more
she beheld him, the more did her love increase, and as he fell on sleep when
his ^^nd was busied with the imagination conceived of Leonorine, after Carmelle
had beheld him long he turned toward her, and without waking, cast forth a
great sigh, saying in his sleep, Alas poor wretch what shall become of me?
The Gentlewoman knew well he had not seen her, wherefore she imboldened her
self to kiss him, and found his face all wet with tears, whereby she feared
he had some melancholy humor that troubled him, and although she esteemed not
thereof, feeling her new disease much more then his grief, taking all to her
advantage, she hoped from that time forwards to find the means to obtain his
love, yet did she fail thereof, for that love (to show his power) had wounded
them both diversely in one place, and at one time, a thing almost incredible,
for who would ever think that little god would enter into such a place? Where
a poor Hermit lived all alone in most strict manner, with a few cold roots,
and not his belly full of bread: yet did he overcome them both, in the most
unfit time (as it may be thought) that could be found, for the black knight
had endured so great travail in fighting, and the Gentlewoman seen so many of
her friends s^ine at one time, that the one had not so much need of comfort,
b^^ the other as much cause to rest. If then it be so (as it is m^^^rue) that
we are all subject to the Tyrant, he that has past ye flower of his youth, not
tasting of h^^ fury, may not think himself in any thing more happy, seeing it
is his manner to constrain young men to love, and ^^^entimes old fools to
dote. In that sort the Gentlewoman (...) ^ennance for the evil she conceived
against the black knight, and had continued longer there, had it not been for
fear to be discovered. Wherefore with the sword in her hand she returned
back again toward the castle, and without being once perceived, entered at a
posterne door, whereof she had the key, and so went up into her chamber,
departing from the hermitage not long before her father and the dumb man
returned from the bark, and found the knight sleeping, who presently awaked,
and missing his sword, asked them if they had taken it away. No truly (said
the Hermit) for we came but now from the sea side. Wherewith Esplandian
esteeming it lost, made account, that as he had conque^ (...) after a strange
manner, so he had lost it by a stranger means, but the Hermit and the dumb
man sought it about the house, and could not find it.

CHAP. X. How King Luisart being advertised by Carmelle where the black knight
was, departed with her alone to find him out.
CArmelle returned to the castle (as it is said before) went to the king, who
at the same time was talking with master Elizabeth touching the wrong he
thought the black knight did him, in departing thence without being known,
seeking by that means if it were possible to draw from him what he knew as
touching the knight: but all in vain, for the king was not so subtle to
undermine him, but master Elizabeth was as crafty to prevent him, not intending
to falsify ye trust reposed in him: and although the Gentlewoman had
determined to show the king what she had learned of the knight, hoping
thereby to obtain her purpose. Nevertheless, seeing master Elizabeth in
presence, she held her peace till he went away, and perceiving the king alone,
said unto him. My lord, if it pleases your grace to show me so much favor,
as to assist me in a thing, that imports as much as my life, in behalf of
the knight, that you so much desire to see, before to morrow at night I will
show him unto you, if you think good, in such a place, where you may easily
speak with him: and to the end you shall not suspect me of untruth* I will show
you a certain token, that when you see it, I am assured you will easily
believe me. Gentlewoman (said ye king) if you do so, I will not fail if it be
possible to satisfy your request. I beseech your grace (said she) when you
are both together, it would please you to be a mean unto him in my behalf to
grant me a gift that I shall ask him. By the faith of a Prince (said he) I
will not fail to do it, nor a greater matter then that, if it lies in my
power. Then follow me (said the Gentlewoman) bringing him where she had laid
the sword, and showing it unto him, asked if he had never seen it. That I have
(said the king) and I would to God the knight that knows so well how to
handle it, were as near unto me as it is. You shall see him in the morning
(said she) if it pleases you to follow me. That will I do (said the king)
armed or unarmed I esteem not whether, so I may see him. Then be you ready
(said she) when I shall call, and let no man go with you. Content (said the
king) wherewith he went out of the chamber, and passing through the court, he
met Libee and others, to whom he said, that in the morning he meant to walk
along the rock (because master Elizabeth had certefied him, it was so goodly
a country) and that none but Carmelle should bear him company, and falling
into other speeches, they passed the time till they went to rest, but the king
could not sleep for the great desire he had to see the knight, whereby he was
hardly fallen asleep, when Carmelle came to awake him, saying: My lord, may it
please your grace to remember your promise? Let us go (said he) and there
with making himself ready, commanded two horses to be sadled, one for
himself, the other for Carmelle, and issuing out of the castle, rode toward
the Hermitage. And they had not traveled far, but they perceived a man
coming toward them in great have, and as he came neere^ the Gentlewoman knew
him, asking what he meant to make such have, and whether he rode. I ride to
the castle (said he) to fetch Matroco and his brother Frerian, with all speed
to help their uncle Lindoraque, who coming to see the^ has met with two
knights armed all in white, that have slain his men, and (as I think) I left
him in as great danger as possible may be. When the king heard him, he
thought them to be of the black knights company, and said unto the
Gentlewoma^, I pray you stay here with this man, and I will ride to see them,
and with that he set spurs to his horse, and taking the same way the other
came, he perceived a far off the two knights fighting with the Giant, that
defended himself most valiantly with his mare, forcing them oftentimes to
recule, but the two knights as bold and nimble, handled him in such sort, that
he knew not how to defend himself, and if he had not slain one of their
horses, it had gone worse with him. Nevertheless the knight on horseback
seeking to revenge his companion, was nothing abashed, but when the other rose
up, set fiercelier upon the Giant then before, in such manner, that they
closed, and striving together, sought by all means to unhorse each other. Mean
time the knight on foot, went unto the Giant, and taking him by the left leg,
pulled him by such force, that both he and the other knight fell off their
horses, and holding each other fast, the Giant fell under with his face
upwards, wherewith the knight that threw him down, thrust him into the face,
that he was constrained to let go his hold, nevertheless rising up again
with great force, and laying hold upon the knight that had so wounded him, he
threw him on the ground, mean time the other gave the Giant such a blow upon
the head, that he began to reele, and therewith stretching out his legs,
yielded up the ghost. With that the king rode somewhat nearer, and perceived
the two knights to bear black crosses, that showed the^ to be Christians,
wherefore riding boldly unto them, he went so near that they knew him,
whereupon they went to do him honor, much abashed to see him. But the king
perceiving the honor they did him, was no less abashed, and said unto them:
My good friends, I know you not, I pray you put off your ^^^^ets that I may
see your faces, which they did, whereby he knew the one to be Talanque son
of Galaor, ye other Ambor de G^^el, son of Angriote destrauaulx; who^ he
friendly embraced, and said unto them, In faith my good friends, it is not
without cause if it likes you well to see me here, for all my life have I
desired the companies of your fathers, the like do I of their children,
wherefore for the love of God I pray you show me what strange adventure has
brought you into this country. And it pleases your grace (said Talanque) we
seek after a knight armed all in black, of whom as yet we can hear no
news. Do you know his name (said the king?) That we do (said Ambor) for it
is your nephew Esplandian: yt contents me (said the king) do but follow me,
and I will bring you where he is. With that Ambor, who before was alighted to
honor the king, mounted again on horseback, and Talanque on the Giants
horse, for his own was slain, and all three together rode ye way the king
came thither, till such time they espied the Gentlewoman, that staid for him:
who perceiving them to ride in such have toward her, was in mind to have fled
away, fearing they had taken the king, and forcibly had him with them, but
perceiving them by their gestures to be his friends, she stayed till they came
unto her, saying to the king. My lord, where has your grace gotten company so
soon? Gentlewoman (said he) you shall know it all in good time, but what have
you done (said he) with the man that I left with you? Let us know what news
he has told you. Truly (said she) I had no sooner assured him of the death of
Matroco and the rest of the castle, but he fled over this hill, as if all the
devils in hell had been behind him: yet he told me that the Giant his master
had heard some rumor thereof, and for the same cause was coming to the castle
to know the truth, accompanied only with two knights, yt he caused to ride
before him, but to their hard fortunes, for he found them both slain, not
knowing who had done it, but only that not long after he met with two strange
knights, that assailed him, and left them fighting (as he said) together. By
God (said the king) if the first two knights sped hardly, their master that
followed after them had little better entertainment, for they are all slain
upon the way, and here are the knights that did it, whom I pray you let us
take with us, for they are friends and companion unto ye knight you have
promised to show me. Let us go then (said she) seeing it is your graces
pleasure: and therewith they rode unto the Hermitage, at the entery whereof,
they found the Hermit set upon a stone, who being abashed to see his daughter
in such company, asked whether she went. Father (said she) here is king
Luisart your Prince and mine, whom I have brought to see you. And although the
Hermit had not seen him in long time before, yet he presently knew him, where
with he stepped to kiss his feet, which the king would not suffer him to
do, but embraced him, and lighting off his horse, followed the Gentlewoman,
till he met the dumb man, that hearing the noise and trampling of horses,
came to see who they were, and perceiving the king, he bowed his head before
him. Nevertheless the king went forward, not staying to speak unto him,
entering presently after Carmelle into the chamber, where he found the knight
set upon the beds side. Wherewith Esplandian presently knew him, and kneeled
down before him, but the king taking him up, weeping for joy embraced him.
With that Talanque and Ambor entered in, and perceiving their companion (that
they so long had sought) were marvelous glad, and coming to embrace him, the
king said to Esplandian: My son, although you have sought by all means to
hide your self from us, yet God has so wrought, that at one instant we have
al three found you out: wherefore I pray you let us depart hence, and go with
us unto the castle, where you shall be better at your ease then in this simple
Hermitage. My lord (said he) I am at your commandment, with that he went
to embrace Talanque and Ambor, asking them (and they him) what had happened
unto the^ since Vrganda caused them to be dubbed knights. By Gods help (said
the king) you shall stay to he (...) the sequel until we be in the castle,
for then you shall have better leisure to declare the same. With that he called
Carmelle, willing her to return with all diligence to the (...) and command
Libee to bring one of Matrocos horses (...) spla^^ian. My lord (said Ambor) it
will be late before he common hither, he sha^^ rather have my horse, and I
will go on foot, but (...) shall not (said the king) get you upon Carmelles
horse, and let (...) sit up behind you. In which manner they road unto the
castle after whom the Hermit and the dumb man followed as fast as they could.
But they scarce alighted off their horses, Ambor and Talanque being unarmed,
but Carmelle moved with the extreme passions of love she bare unto ye black
knight, had almost slain her self with the sword that the day before she had
stolen from him, the occasion whereof proceeded from a conceit yt he would
disdain her as unworthy of him, he being the son of Amadis de Gaul, as
she understood: yet in the end she remembered the promise the king had made,
wherefore she determined to desire so much of him, to be a means unto
Esplandian, that he would grant she might never be absent from him, but would
serve him during her life with all fidelity, and to the same end, putting her
determination in effect, as they sat all together, she kneeled before the king,
and said. My lord, now your grace sees I have kept my promise. That is true
(said he) and while I live I will not be unmindful of it. My lord (said she)
then I trust your grace has not forgotten the gift you promised me: and to
perform your word, I pray you be a means to the black knight that he will
grant me my request. Gentlewomen (said the king) be you assured I will do
it with all my heart. Your grace (said she) as yesterday gave me leave to
visit my father in the Hermitage, who as it fortuned when I came thither was
gone forth, whereat I was abashed, because he never used to be far from
thence: And finding the door open, I went into a chamber (that I caused to be
furnished) wherein sometimes I use to lie, when time or foul weather would not
permit me to return unto the castle, where I found this knight (pointing to
Esplandian) which you all so much desired to see, fast sleeping, his sword
hanging at his beds head, where with not long sit hence he has slain those,
that from my infancy ha^ brought the up, and being moved by reason of my no
little loss, with a desir^ to revenge both my self and my friends, I though^
^o kill him, ^^d was so near the point to execute my will, that as I held the
(...) drawn in my hand, and began to lift up mine arm to gi^e the blow, he
seemed so fair within mine eye, that sudd^in^y I was surprised with love, and
that so fervently, that were (...) not for the promise you have made me, I had
not ben alive at th^^ present time. Nevertheless having sithence understood,
that he by whom I am in this extremity, in estate and degree* ^ot to be my
equal, whereby I perceive my self unworthy ei^^er to be wife or companion
unto him, I have somewhat moderated my first deliberation in such manner, that
I will hold my self more then satisfied, if it please him I may only continue
with him, to serve at his commandment during my life, which in reason he cannot
well deny me, for let him do what he will, so long as life is in my body, I
will never forsake him, if I be not constrained thereunto. Wherefore my lord,
for the honor of God, I beseech your grace to find the means my poor
request may once be granted, and you Gentlemen (said she to Ambor and
Talanque) I pray you put to your helps, that by your favors the life of me
poor lover, not beloved, may be prolonged. The king hearing the Gentlewoman
(that while she spoke sometime blushed, and other whiles waxed pale) make this
discourse, could hardly abstain to laugh, thinking how inconsiderately she had
fallen into so great extremity, whereby he feared if he should make an
answer other then pleased her, she would kill her self, but with courteous
speech he said unto her: Gentlewoman, your request is so reasonable, that I
am of opinion he will not deny it: and for my part, I will entreat him as much
as possible I can. My lord (said Esplandian) I will do what your grace
commands. Grant her then I pray you (said the king) what she craves at
your hands, that from henceforth she may be called your faithful servant,
her honor always saved, as in knighthood you are bound. I will do it,
answered Esplandian, and thereof I assure you (said he) speaking to Carmelle,
who kneeling on the ground kissed his feet, and thanked the king and him most
heartely, reputing he^ self most happy, in obtaining so great favor.

CHAP. XI How Talanque and Ambor showed the king what adventures they had found
seeking for Esplandian their companion, after they had received the order of
knighthood.
YOu heard before in what sort king Luisart was delivered out of prison by his
nephew Esplandian, but as yet he knew not the manner how he received the order
of knighthood. Wherefore as they rose from dinner, the king desired him to tell
him how he was made knight, as also what happened unto him since that time, to
the end (said he) that Talanque and Ambor may do the like. Then Esplandian
told how Vrganda came unto the Ferme island in the great serpent, what speech
she had with Amadis de Gaul, and others that were with him, the order she
used to dub him knight, together with Talanque, Ambor, Manely, and the king of
Denmark: The sleep wherein they fell, and that when he awaked, he found
himself at the foot of the rock of the Enchantresse, in company of Sergil his
Squire and two dumb men, also how he conquered the sword, with his arrival at
the mountain, where he found the Hermit, that dissuaded him from fighting with
the giants. By my head (said the king) I never heard stranger things, And now
Ambor (said he) what became of you? My lord (said Ambor) my companion and I
were likewise asleep, and when we awaked we found our selves in a little bark
with our two horses, in a Haven of the sea called Armata in the country of
Norway (as then unknown to us) where we landed before a town, not only to
know in what country we were, but also to seek for victuals. And as we went
toward it, the watch of the town (by reason of certain dissension not long
before moved between them and their neighbors) sent to know what we would
have. Wherewith we made them answer, we were knights aduenturous that came
from the Ferme Isle, cast upon that shore by tempest of weather. In good truth
said he that spoke unto us, our king has so great cause to use your helps,
that if you go unto him, I am well assured he will bid you welcome. We asked
him the kings name, and what country we were in. My lords (said he) the
country is called Norway, whereof Adroni father in law to Agraies, son to the
king of Scots, and one of the best knights in the world, is our king, I know
not whether you know him. And what cause said we, has your king to use our
help? I will tell you (said he) he is so old, that one of his nephews, his
sisters son, (procured thereunto by evil counsel) is risen in arms against
him, seeking to have the government of the country, in respect (as he says)
his uncle is no more able to rule the same. And under that pretense has
already usurped a great part thereof, and now lies in camp before one of the
best cities in this land, which the king by no means can relieve, by reason
that most of his trustiest friends have forsaken him, and hold with the young
presumptuous fool, that wins them by fair promises, a thing that
oftentimes happens unto such as fortune favors not, and when men are
fallen, they are not only abandoned of strangers, but by their own kindred
and friends, that properly may be termed friends for ye present time. In good
faith said we, if the town will give us victuals, and one to guide us, we will
gladly go and present our service unto him, not only for the love of Agraies,
to whom we are companions, but for the right he has, as you have told us.
That shall be done (said he) and therewith desired us to stay till he came
again from the city, where he stayed not long, but he brought what we
desired, and a guide that conducted us so well, that the next day about dinner
time we arrived where the king lay. Who being advertised of our coming, and
that we were of Agraies companions, entertained us most courteously,
commanding one of his Gentlemen to unarm us in one of his best chambers,
whether he came, and after he had bidden us welcome, began in the same
manner to show us all what the watch had before declared unto us, and what an
unnatural part his nephew showed unto him, procured thereunto by two knights,
in whom only he puts his whole trust, because (said he) they are well
assured, that not any of my knights dares enter into combat with them, they
are esteemed so valiant and hardy. But who has moved them and your cousin
(said we) to undertake so foul an action? Because (said the king) I have no
issue male, and my cousin alleges I am over old to govern the country,
saying, it is fitter for him then for me to do it: but if I can I will hold him
from it, and keep it for my daughter Olinde and Agraies her husband: By my
soul (said I) I am of this opinion, that seeing this war is begun only to
try the title, you both pretend in one thing, It were good your quarrel
shoule be ended by the combat of two knights of both parts, without the death
and destruction of so many poor innocent people as daily perish by the same
means, remitting the issue thereof to those whom it shall please God to make
victorious: and if it pleases you, I and my companion will be the two knights
that shall fight for you. But when he heard me speak in that manner, he
paused a while, seeming very pensive, till in the end he answered me and said,
Sir knights, I am not yet so well acquainted with you, that I should venture to
hazard so great a kingdom as this is upon your valor, Nevertheless, if you
will assure me for a truth that you are knights of the Ferme Island, I am
content to stand to it whatsoever may chance. For there can none but valiant
knights come from thence, being assured (as I suppose) that otherwise the lord
of the place would not give them intertainement. Then we swore unto him, that
what we had said was true. Whereupon he presently dispatched a trumpet with
message to his enemy, to offer him the combat, who hearing the news seemed
very glad, making account that his two knights (so much esteemed) would easily
overcome any two of the best knights the king had. So that returning the
messenger again, he sent one of his trumpets with him to conclude the
combat, with the day, time and place where it should be done, as also what
pledges should on both sides be given for performance thereof, so that on the
day appointed, after each party had solemnly taken their oaths, we entered into
ye lists, where we had a cruel and dangerous combat one against the other,
but in the end right lying on our sides, we wan the victory. And as we would
have stricken off their heads, the kings nephew desired us most earnestly to
grant him their lives, which we agreed unto, upon condition, that from that
time forwards he should suffer his uncle to reign in peace, not molesting him
any more, which he promised to perform. In this combat we were so wounded,
that of force we continued in Norway longer then we meant to do, where during
our abode, certain merchants arrived in the city, that had seen (as they
told us) upon the sea, near unto the rock of the Enchauntresse, a Serpent
greater then any vessel, which so much astonished them, that they knew not
what to do, whereby we heard news of Esplandian. With that (although we were
not altogether healed of our wounds) yet we besought the king to cause us to
be conducted thither, which he willingly granted, and we took sea, with so
good a wind, that within six days after we approached the rock where the
serpent stayed, yt at the first made us somewhat abashed, although we had seen
it oftentimes before. Nevertheless, we found it flashing such flames of fire
out of the mouth and nosthrils thereof, that we feared the fire would fall
into our ship, whereby not without much pain and trouble, we procured our
master and mariners to approach it, and perceiving no creature aboard to
speak unto, we began to hallow unto them with so loud a voice, that at the
last Sergil appeared upon the hatches, and weeping, told us what had happened
unto his master on the rock of the Enchauntresse, and how after that one of
the dumb men had caused him to enter into a little bark, and there with put
to sea, so that he knew not if he were dead or living, for he had heard no
news of him, and there he stayed with another dumb man in the greatest care
that might be. With that we willed him to call the dumb man unto us, and
when he came, by signs we made unto him, we showed him what pleasure he
might do us if he would bring us to ye place where his fellow had carried
Esplandian, which as it seemed he was content to do, for presently thereupon he
entered into our vessels and sailed so well, that the tenth day after he set us
on land, hard by the place where we slew the Giant and the two knights, and so
your grace has heard what fortunes we have passed since we received the
order of knighthood. Truly (said the king) if those of Manely and the king of
Denmark be as strange, it may well be said, there never happened the like
beginning unto six young knights.

CHAP. XII. How one night as King Luisart was in his bed, thinking how he
might return again into great Britain, he heard so pleasant a sound of
instruments, that he rose up to see where it might be: and what happened
after that.
KIng Luisart continued so long in the castle on the mountain, that at the
last he waxed weary, not so much for the desire he had to be in his own
country, as for the grief he certainly knew the Queen would conceive, by
reason of his long absence: in which kind of pensiveness he continued
certain nights together, that by means thereof he could take no rest, till
at the last one night among the rest about half an hour before day, he heard
the sweetest music that ever played, wherewith he rose out of his bed, and
without making any noise opened the window, to hear it better. But as then it
was very dark, and the wind blew so hard, that the sea rising therewith, beat
against the hollownesse of the rock, in such sort that the noise thereof, and
the sound of the music, made a new kind of harmony: wherewith he was so much
delighted, that he awaked Esplandian, Ambor and Talanque, that slept soundly,
as young men without malancholy humors, are accustomed to do. But when they
heard the music, they stayed not long in their beds, but went to the window
to see who it might be, but they could see nothing till day began to appear.
When they perceived the great Serpent surging on the shore, wherewith they were
exceeding glad, making full account that the arrival thereof brought them some
good news: Wherewith they made them ready, and without longer staying, issued
out of the castle, to see who was in the same, and as they stood on the shore,
they perceived a small boat, and a Gentlewoman coming out of it, bearing in her
arms a packet covered with Taffata, who coming unto the king, with most humble
reverence said unto him. My lord, and it pleases your grace, Vrganda
recommendeth her unto your majesty, and has commanded me to give you
intelligence, that being busied to aid the Emperor and the Empress your
daughter, in a certain thing of great importance, she has not had the means
to come and visit you. Then presenting ye packet to Esplandian, said unto him,
Gentle knight, My mistress that loves and favors you, as it is well
known, gives you these arms, and sends you word by me, that as she gave
you the black arms, that hitherto you have borne (to testify thereby the
sorrow for the loss of the king, that as then was common among all his true
subjects and friends) So in these you shall find the devise of the lady, that
in beauty and comeliness of person surpasses all the ladies in the world, as
Amadis your father in time past well proved, when she set the crown upon her
head, in remembrance whereof she has ever sithence borne the like devise.
Who from henceforth shall be so strongly fixed in your heart, that you shall
never give stroke with sword nor lance, but you will remember her. Which she
said in respect of the princess Leonorine, daughter to the Emperor of
Constantinople, that by destiny was appointed only unto him. And opening the
pack she pulled out a helmet, shield, Haubert, and a Caparisson for a horse
all of white, imbrodered with crowns of gold, and set with Diamonds and
Pearls, which he most willingly received, saying to the Gentlewoman: I pray
you in my behalf give Vrganda hearty thanks for the great honor and much
good she has continually done unto me, assuring her, that wheresoever I
become, she has a knight of me ready to obey her, and that for the love of
her will bear these arms as long as it pleases her. Be it so in the name of
God (said she) but before long time be past, you shall have another
mistress, that will constrain you to do greater matters, for she shall
ravish both your heart and liberty in such manner, that you should loose
overmuch, if at sometimes you loose not your self for her. And to conclude, I
tell you that my mistress feels her self as yet so much bound, and
beholding to my lord Amadis your father, because that by his means, she
recovered her friend, that during her life she will use all the means she can to
do him plasure, and you likewise for his sake. And as she delivered ye
message unto him, Carmelle came thither, and hearing her speak in that manner,
answered her and said, Gentlewoman, I pray you tell your mistress from me,
that she has great cause to recompense them well, by whom she enioieth her
friend she loves so entirely: and tell her I know many, to whom if such chance
should happen, that would not fail to acknowledge it with the price of their
dearest blood, and their souls likewise if need were. In faith (said the
gentlewoman) I know not in whose behalf you speak it, but I know assuredly
you touch me at the quick, which she uttered with so good a grace, that the
king could not refrain to smile, having in times past felt the fury of love,
when he first saw the Queen in the country of Denmark. Yet be changed his
countenance, asking the Gentlewoman from whence that music came that he
heard in the morning before break of day. My lord (said she) being sometimes
in greater passions then willingly I would, I pass my melancholy humors with
a Lute that I have, especially when I cannot sleep, which as I think, was it
you heard. What company have you in the Serpent (said the king?) None (said
she) but Esplandians Squire, that I found in a manner dead, for the desire he
had to hear news of his master, to whom also I have brought the goodliest
white horse, and the best harnaised that ever was seen, which my mistress
sends him likewise. Did she command you to say nothing else unto me (said the
king?) Yes my lord (said she) she sends you word, that at my arrival
here, you and he should enter into this ship, that of it self will bring you
into great Britain, and that the fortunes yt not long since happened unto
you, are snares the world sets to entrap those it seeks to deceive,
seeming to join green and flourishing age with that which already is dried up
and withered. And further wills you to put in effect, yt which in your self
you have determined to do: (which was to forsake his kingly estate, and live a
solitary life) but he wondered much that Vrganda knew it, yet he made no show
thereof, but speaking to the Gentlewoman, he said. Your mistress binds me
daily more and more unto her, being well assured, that without her help I
could hardly have found any to have brought me into my country. Wherefore I pray
you tell her, that whatsoever I have, is at her commandment, and as touching
my determination, which (as soon as I conceived in my mind, I perceived it was
known to her) being at home, if God gives me life, I mean to put in
execution. My lord (said she) she prays you to commend the keeping of this
castle to Talanque and Ambor, (not taking any with you but Esplandian, Sergil,
and master Elizabeth) knowing for certain that hereafter they shall do such
things, that their renoume will spread throughout the world. Wherewith my lord
I will take my leave, and return again to her with the dumb men, that shall
guide me in this little bark. God have you in his keeping (said the king.)
Then the Gentlewoman with her two Mariners entered into the bark that brought
Esplandian thither, and setting sail, put to sea.

CHAP. XIII. How King Luisart embarked himself in the great Serpent, and of
the message Esplandian sent by Carmelle, unto the Princess Leonorine, daughter
to the Emperor of Constantinople.
THe Gentlewoman that brought the message with the two dumb men, embarked and
put to sea, far from the rock: king Luisart and the rest went unto the
castle, where he stayed not long, for according to the advice Vrganda had given
him, he desired Ambor and Talanque with Libee and the rest of the company to
keep the castle, promising with all speed to send them provision of all things
necessary, whereof they wanted. But when Esplandian saw there was no remedy,
but of force he must obey the king (much displeased to depart so far from the
borders of Constantinople, where he hoped to find her whereof master Elizabeth
had brought him the first news) he took his faithful servant Carmelle
aside, and said unto her: My good friend, I was in mind never to falsify the
promise I have made you, nor the gift you required at my hands, nevertheless,
trusting more in you then any other, I pray you take it not in evil part, if
(to save my life) I send you to a place, whether I thought to have gone my self
in person, but it pleases the king (as you well know) that I shall bear him
company. My lord (said she) I most humbly thank you for the honor it
pleases you to show me, swearing unto you by the living God, that I take no
pleasure but in fulfilling your desire, wherefore I pray you fear not to
command me what you think good, for whatsoever may happen thereby, I will be
obedient unto you during my life. My good friend (said Esplandian) embracing
her, I will one day recompense your good will, and seeing you are minded to do
me so much favor, you must then take your journey to Constantinople, on
message to the Princess Leonorine, the Emperors daughter, to whom (having
presented my most humble and hearty commendations) you shall on my behalf say,
How that at such time as I received the order of knighthood, I was commanded by
my lord Amadis my father to repair to her fathers court, there to discharge
him of the promise he made unto her (which was either to return again to do
her service, or to send one of his lineage thither in his place) Nevertheless,
considering with my self his great valor and Prowess, and the great beauty
that is reported to be in her, which my small desert in regard of him that
gave me the commandment, I am afraid to undertake the same. Notwithstanding,
it has pleased her (by maistee Elizabeth) to put me in mind thereof, although
while breath is in my body I will never fail to be her knight. And to the end
she may give credit to your message, you shall present this ring unto her,
which she knows well, as being the same she gave unto my father, to put him
in remembrance of his promise. My lord (said she) I will fulfill your
commandment, but if you go so far from hence, where shall I find you, when I
come back again? In this place (said Esplandian) whether I will return as
soon as I have brought the king into great Britain. Then calling Libee, he
commanded him, that presently after he had set sail, he should cause a ship
to be prepared for Carmelle, to go on message where he would send her, that
done, he went to find the king and master Elizabeth, that stayed for him in
the Serpent, the which presently upon his entering therein, of her self began to
set forwards with such speed, that in short space they left the coast of
Turkey, and the twentieth day after, they discovered ye Ferme Isle, where she
stayed, which those of ye country perceiving, advertised Amadis and the rest of
the company, who in great have ran unto the Haven, but they were no sooner come
thither, when they espied the king, Esplandian, master Elizabeth, and Sergil,
landing out of a little boat. Wherewith being all abashed, but much more
pleasod, stepped forwards to receive the^, and after many imbracings and
salutations on either part, Amadis presented the Giant Balan to the king, whom
as yet he had never seen, and therewith set forward toward the palace of
Apolidon, whereof Oriane and the rest of the ladies having intelligence, the
great sorrow that so long time they had used for his absence, was converted
into joy, which much more increased, when the king in presence of them all,
rehearsed the manner how Esplandian delivered him out of Arcabonnes hands, and
the great Prowess he showed against Matroco, Frerion, and Arcalaus their
uncle. Oriane knew well the great desire and much grief the Queen had, because
she heard no news of the king, wherefore the same day she sent her danish
Gentlewoman to advertise her of his arrival, who made such have, that within
six days after she arrived at London, at such time the Queen sat down to
dinner.

CHAP. XIIII. How King Luisart departed from the Ferme Isle, accompanied of
diverse knights, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, and being near London, in a forest
they met with four knights, that sent to ask four courses with their lances
against Esplandian.
THree days king Luisart continued in the Ferme Isle, and the fourth day he
determined to go see the Queen, and to the same end, with all ye company of
knights, ladies, and gentlewomen, he set forwards toward London, and travailed
so fast, that they were within a days journey of the city. And as they
entered into a forest, where they used commonly to chase the Heart, they saw in
the high way four knights, well mounted and armed at all points, each his
Esquire by his side, bearing their shield and lances, for they had their
helmets on their heads. And with that they perceived a Gentlewoman coming
toward them, riding on a palfrey, and being near them, speaking to
Esplandian, she said, Sir knight with the white arms, those four knights you
see in the high way before you, send you word by me, that they would gladly
know the cause why you bear the devise of crowns, wherein if you satisfy
their desire, in such sort that their honors be not stained, they will from
henceforth refrain to inquire the same any more: otherwise, they give you by
me to understand, it were best for you to leave them, or else that you defend
them well, as being the most honorable devise that is in all the world. When
Esplandian heard her speak in that manner, in courteous sort he answered her
and said. Gentlewoman, to satisfy their request I pray you tell them, that the
devise and the arms I bear was given me by Vrganda, but for what cause I know
not, nevertheless I bear them for the love of her, as also that they like me
well: and if this content them not, tell them, me thinks the occasion of
combat between me and them is so small, that for this time I would desire
them to forbear the same. In good faith (said she) smiling, you speak with
reason, for they are knights that seem to have much need of your counsel, but
notwithstanding good sir, I pray you be not unprovided, for your excuses will
not be received. Gentlewoman (said Esplandian) if they assail me, it shall
be against my will. Truly (said she) as far as I perceive, the great beauty
that is in you, together with the rich arms and goodly horse you ride upon are
worse bestowed then ever was any, when you are not ashamed ^^ make an answer
so little to your credit. Nevertheless, either you must forsake the way to
London, and this good company, or defend the brave devise you bear, as they
have sent you word. The way (said Esplandian) is common to all men, and out of
it (for them) I will not go, wherefore if they assail me, I must of force
defend my self. And because the Gentlewoman was not known among them, they all
mused who she might me, as also who the four knights were that sent her, to
whom she returned again. Mean time Esplandian laced on his helmet, taking
his lance in his hand, ready to fight if occasion served. Wherewith Amadis and
the rest of the company were exceeding glad, doubting least the king had spoken
in favor of him, when he showed what he had done, but they had not ridden
long, but one of ye four knights came riding softly toward them, and about a
carriers length from them, called to Esplandian and said, You sir knight that
would not satisfy our desires, defend your self from me. Wherewith he set
spurs to his horse and Esplandian likewise, who at ye first encounter cast
him so strongly out of his saddle, that in long time after he could not rise
again, and therewith his lance brake: with yt the second knight came
forwards, willing Esplandian to take another lance, for he meant to revenge
his companion. Which Amadis hearing, sent him his lance, that he willingly
received, and being in a rage to see himself assailed without cause, he ran
against the knight, and struck him so surely on the breast, that he overthrew
him both horse and man. Well (said the king) to the standers by, judge you if
it be possible to do better? My lord (said Agraies) I never saw two fairer
strokes given with a lance, the rest I will leave to consider of till I know
those that ran against him. Let us see the end (said the king) and calling a
Squire, he sent his lance unto Esplandian, for as then the third knight
prepared himself to run, and spurring their horses, set forwards so
fiercely, that breaking their lances, they met so strongly, body and shields,
and heads together, that Esplandian had much ado to sit upon his horse, and
the other had such a fall, that he lay still upon ye ground. Whereat the fourth
knight being abashed, said unto himself, Truly, both the king and Vrgan^^
^^ue good reason (as they do) to assure the valor and Prowess of this knight,
seeing it is much more then they warrant it to be: Nevertheless, I must of
force try him, otherwise I should do both my self and him wrong. And with
that he called Esplandian and said, Knight, Although I well know the small
courtesy, that I and my companions have showed unto you, yet I must not refuse
to do the same that they have done before me, wherefore I pray you send to
some of your company for another lance, that we may see who shall bear the
honor of this enterprise. I will do it (said he) seeing you constrain me
thereunto, upon condition that if I can, I will serve you in the like sort I
have done your companions. With that Gransador that heard them speak, gave him
his lance, which he presently charging, they met together with such force,
that their lances brake close unto their hands, neither of them removing out
his saddle, wherefore the knight of the forest turned to Esplandian and said,
Sir Knight; let us yet try one blow more, and I will quite you for this time.
You might content your self (said he) with that is done, but seeing you are
so void of reason, I am content to try it with you, till one of us be beaten
off his horse. Then he sent Sergil to fetch another lance, and he brought him
one some what bigger and shorter then those he had before, wherewith he
struck the knight of the forest so valiantly, that he overthrew him, himself
being constrained to embrace his horse about the neck, or else he had fallen
as the other did that lay on the ground, yet he rose before Esplandian had
run out his course and as he returned bark, he stayed him by the armor and
said unto him, Before God sir knight, you have sufficiently showed that in
valor and Prowess you are second to none but to your self: but he answered
not a word, but holding down his head (ashamed of that had happened unto him)
passed forth. With that the king came thither to know what knights they were
that had been overthrown, among the which he knew Galaor, for he had put off
his helmet to do him honor when he saw him come, whereat the king was so well
pleased, that he alighted of his horse and ran to embrace him, the like did
Amadis, saying unto him, with a smiling countenance, How now brother Galaor,
how long have you used to be a keeper of the high ways? You see (said he)
that I and my companions have sought to try whether this knight be of such
force as we have found him, and what has happened you may well judge, when
Esplandian understood his uncle Galaor (fearing to have offended) he lighted
off his horse, and kneeling down before him, asked pardon for his fault.
Nephew (said he) it is I that have done the wrong, and therefore I told the
king that you are a better knight then I, and marvel not if I sought to
prove it, Because I thought to do it with mine honor, but I found the
contrary, which from henceforth shall make me think the things foreshewed of
you will be accomplished so well, that the glory of your father, and the
reputation by many knights in times past obtained, shall from henceforth be
extinguished, you having so easily overthrown three of ye best knights in
great Britain, and my self the fourth. What are they (said the king?) My
lord (said Galaor) the first that ran was Sendale of Gonaste, the second
Galuanes, the third Angriote d'estrauaulx, and my self has done worse then
they. Whereat the king and all the company began to laugh: And embracing them,
caused them to mount on horseback, riding toward London, where in the way the
King prayed them to tell him how this enterprise was devised. My Lord (said
Galaor) having understood by the danish Gentlewoman (that my lady Oriane not
long since sent unto the Queen, to bring her news of your return, and what
had happened unto you during your imprisonment) the valiant acts by you
declared of my nephew Esplandian, we conceived such a jealousy against him,
esteeming the honor you did him thereby, to proceed rather of fatherly love
then otherwise, that we determimined secretly to depart out of London to prove
his force, as now you have well seen: and to move him thereunto, we sent the
gentlewoman with the message you have heard. Of my faith (said the king) the
devise was good, and has fallen out well. In this manner devising of sundry
things, he came to Mirefleur, where the Queen met him, praising God for his
unexpected return, and considering his trouble past, with the grief she had
for his long absence, seeing him there safe and in good health, she thought
her self well recompensed with his presence. The next day in the morning they
set forwards toward London, where the people received him with such signs of
gladness, that most part of them wept for joy to see him, for there was never
Prince better loved of his subjects the^ he. Being there, Esplandian began to
be weary of the place, longing to hear news of Carmelle, that he had sent to
Constantinople, as you have heard before. And therefore every day he devised
means to get license to depart from thence, pretending a cause of returning to
the castle called La montaigne defendu, showing the king what promise he had
made to his companions, which if he did not perform, they should have cause
to complain of him, but the king would not in any sort grant to his request,
yet in the end, overcome with much importunity, he was content, wherewith he
took his leave of all the court, and upon a monday in the morning taking
horse, accompanied only of master Elizabeth, and Sergil his squire, he took
his way toward the Ferme Isle, hoping to find the great Serpent there,
wherein they might imbarke themselves.

CHAP. XV. How Esplandian riding toward the Ferme Isle, was assailed by a
strange knight that watched him in the forest.
ESplandian departed from the king, and having taken his leave of all the
court, as you heard before, took the crookeddest way he could, through woods
and forests toward the Ferme Isie, thinking not to be perceived of any, that
might hinder his enterprise. And having ridden three miles, he entered into a
forest, which having almost passed, he came unto a great river* whereupon the
king had built a house, called Bellerose, where oftentimes being on hunting,
he used to resort. And as he thought to pass the bridge, he perceived on the
other side a knight armed at all points ready to fight, that cried unto him
with a loud voice, and said: Sir knight, you must ask me leave if you will come
over, for according to my promise, I have taken upon me to keep this bridge,
for the space of one whole year, wherefore if you think good, you may take
some other way. With that Esplandian was much grieved, perceiving that either
of force he must fight, or seek another passage, wherefore he would willingly
have excused himself, and said: Sir knight, I pray you then show me which way
I were best to go, for by me you shall have no cause at this time to trouble
your self. You must return again to London (said he) for other passage is
there none, unless you will loose your horse and go on foot. Rather the I
would do so (said Esplandian) I will prove if I can win yours, and therewith
lacing his helmet, took his lance and road unto the knight, who no sooner
perceived him coming, but setting spurs to his horse, ran toward him,
whereby they met so fiercely together, that both ye knights fell off their
horses, in such manner, that master Elizabeth and Sergil, thought verily they
had slain each other, but they stayed not long before they rose again, and
laying hand on their swords, there began between them the cruellest and most
dangerous battle that ever was seen: whereat master Elizabeth much abashed,
said unto himself, Good God, what may this mean, I believe for certain that
some devil of hell has transformed himself into humane shape, to destroy us
all. Mean time the two knights continued in most cruel fight, still
increasing their mights, cleaving shields and armours, in such sort, that all
the field was covered with pieces of the harneis, and died with blood that
issued from their bodies, till at the last the knight of the bridge stepped back
and said unto Esplandian, Sir knight, take another way, and I am content to
quite you of the combat, for you are the valiantest knight that ever I dealt
withal, and it should displease me much, if by your wilfulness you would be
cause of your own death. In good faith (said he) I had done it at the first,
had it not been, the fear I had, that you would esteem me a coward, but
knowing very well that the honor of this combat cannot be had, but only by
the death of one of us, or both together, I will try my fortune, till I be no
longer able to weld a sword. Is that true (said the knight?) Then let us see to
whom fortune will be favorable. And therewith covering themselves with that
little of their shields that rested in their hands, they began the combat
crueller then before, as though all the day they had not given a stroke, so
that after many cruel blows with their swords, they closed together, and
wrestling long time, they sought to cast each other to the ground. But seeing
the little advantage gotten thereby, they began again to lay on with their
swords with such fury, that Sergil looked for no other but when they should
fall dead upon the ground, not being able to judge who would have the victory.
Whereat master Elizabeth was so much displeased, that he could not abstain
from weeping, saying unto himself, Alas what fortune is this, must the best
knight living in the world, and in the flower of his age lose his life at that
time by so hard a chance? Cursed be the day that ever he met with him, that is
the cause of so great loss. And to say truth, if God had not provided for
them, the father had slain the son, and the son the father, for the knight
of the bridge was Amadis de Gaul, who being over curious of his sons glory
would prove his force, and the better to do it, the day before Esplandian
took his leave, he departed secretly from the court, and stayed for him at
the bridge, bearing an unknown armor, where after many attempts on either
part given, Amadis perceiving both their dangers, said unto Esplandian: Knight,
you see well you cannot overcome me, and I assure you, I never had to do with
any knight, that ever put me to so great extremity, wherefore I am content to
let you pass. But not I you (said he) unless you tell me your name. I will
not deny you that (said Amadis) wherefore cause master Elizabeth to come
hither, for I think we have both need of his help. Then Esplandian called him
unto them, mean time Amadis put off his helmet, so faint and weary, that he
was constrained to lean unto a tree. But when Esplandian knew him and
perceiving the fault he had committed, he cast forth a great cry, and said:
Alas wicked wretch that I am, and therewith he fell upon the ground, whereat
master Elizabeth and Amadis thinking him to be in a sound, ran to lift him
up, but it was not so, only that it grieved him he had dealt in such manner
with his father, who said unto him, son, although I am as sore wounded as
possible may be, without death, yet have I not received so much hurt, as
conceived pleasure, perceiving the valor I find to be in you, wherefore be
not discomforted. Notwithstanding he could not content himself, but cursed his
own life, being (as he said) the most unhappy man that ever was borne of
woman. And continuing in that grief, ye blood in diverse places ran out of
his body, whereby he waxed faint, which master Elizabeth perceiving, and
knowing assuredly, if remedy were not speedily had, they were both in danger of
their lives, he said unto them: I pray you for this time leave off your
sorrow, and let us presently go to Mirefleur, not far from hence, for you both
have greater need of rest, then of longer staying in this place, wherewith he
and Sergil set them on their horses, and with great pain brought them to the
castle, where their wounds were dressed. Such was the combat between the two
knights as you have heard, yet some write, that Amadis was so wounded by
Esplandian, that in the end with a thrust of a lance into the right shoulder,
and other blows with his sword, he was slain in the field, which Oriane
hearing, threw her self out of a window, and brake her neck. But it is not
true, for they reigned after that both in France and great Britain, and had
another son named Perion, and a daughter no less beautiful then her mother,
that married Arquisil son to the Emperor of Rome. But I cannot conceive from
whence those liars could invent such a thing, if they understand not by (death)
the shadows that Esplandian caused his fathers valiant acts to be covered
withal, by the light and pleasant shining of his own, whereby his fathers were
so much had in oblivion, that there was no more brute of them, then if they had
never been done. But to return again unto our matter, you must note that
news went presently unto the court, what had chanced to the two knights.
Wherewith the king and Oriane much displeased, departed from London, and came
to Mirefleur, when master Elizabeth began the second time to dress their
wounds. Whereby he perceived them out of danger, and cured them so well, that
within seven days after they could walk about the chamber, which put Oriane
in better comfort then before, and it fell out well for her, for if her
malancholy had longer endured she had for certain died at that time. And
because the king had not as yet understood the reason that moved them to
fight, one day when he found Amadis in good disposition, he prayed him to
tell him. In faith my lord (said he) I was desirous to have the difference of
our two forces known, being assured, that whatsoever chanced thereby, it
could not be but to mine honor: for if my son be a better knight then my
self, his honor for the present time, will increase my glory past. Before God
(said the king) your enterprise was but rashly undertaken, I pray you another
time let us leave such youthful parts for those that are but entering into
arms. Believe me, and it pleases your grace (said he) I was never better
beaten in all my life. It is no matter (said the king) seeing you have both
escaped with your lives, now seek means to be healed of your wounds with as
much speed as you may, and from henceforth let us war only against Hearts and
other wild beasts that are within this forest, as my huntsmen have showed me
this day.

CHAP. XVI. How the King of Denmark, Garinter, and Manely, succored Vrganda,
that certain knights would have slain, because she aided the Emperors son
of Rome.
YOu heard before of the adventures of Esplandian, Ambor and Talanque, after
they had received the order of knighthood, now you shall hear what became of
Garinter king of Denmark, and Manely, who sleeping as others did by the sound
of six trumpets that played on the shore, the next night they found themselves
with their squires in a little bark, so far out of al knowledge, that
although they had landed they knew not where they were, and it was so dark,
that they could not see each other, till at the last they perceived a fire not
far from thence, that moved them to go thither, to see if they could find
any that would show them in what country they were, therefore leaving their
squires to keep their bark, they took their shields, and mounting up a
little hill, they perceived a fire burning circle wise, in the middle whereof
they saw a woman holding a young child in her arms, and about the fire stood
ten knights all armed, that sought to take her, but by no means they could
come near her, she was so well defended by the fire. And as they went nearer
unto it, they heard one among the rest that said unto her, Ha, thou false and
accursed wretch, thy devilish spirits and familiars can now no longer help
thee, but at this time thou shall surely die. And although Manely and Garinter
had their helmets on their heads, yet the woman they so threatened, knew them
well, calling the^ and said: Help me my sons, and fail me not I pray you at
this time. With that Manely and the king of Denmark knew her by her voice,
wherefore laying hands on their swords, they marched toward the ten knights,
whereof one of them stepped before the rest, asking them if they knew that
wicked woman that had done him the greatest mischief that ever was. By God sir
knight (said Manely) you lie in your throat, she is not wicked, but faithfuller
for her part, then you for yours. Wherewith they ran each upon other, and there
began the combat of ten knights against two, and although the match was not
equal, Manely and the king of Denmark setting their backs together, laid
valiantly upon them, yet in the end they could not have resisted, but Vrganda
playing her part, put out the fire, and taking her two knights aside, left the
rest in the dark, striking each other as if Manely and the king of Denmark
had been with them. Mean time Vrganda and her company got into the thicket of
the wood, and having travailed long, at the last the moon began to shine, when
they were weary, whereby they determined to stay a while and rest themselves
till day appeared. Mean time the two knights desired Vrganda to show them how
she came thither, and whether she knew the country. My good friends (said she)
having long since learned by my art, that this little child son to the Emperor
of Rome, and of the Empress Leonor his wife, should be stolen away by the
Traitor that assailed you, who is son to Garadan, that Amadis (as then called
the knight of the green sword) put to death in the country of Bohemia, in
defending the right of king Tafmor: As soon as you fell on sleep in the great
Serpent, I made all the have I could unto this place to succor it, according to
my promise made (being in the Ferme Isle) in presence of Amadis and diverse
other knights, where I arrived at so good a time when the villains which you
saw, came to a shepherds house, where a poor nurse dwelt, to whom they
delivered this little child to give it suck. And seeing it was time to put my
enterprise in practice, I went out of my bark, and making as if I had been
robbed by certain thieves, ran toward them, crying out and weeping
bitterly, wherewith they all came forth to see what it might be, and perceiving
me in that manner, asked the cause of my grief. Ha my lords (said I) It is so,
that as my husband and I passed through this wood, we met eight thieves, that
slew him, and not content therewith, have taken away my horse and my budget,
wherein there is a great sum of money. Which they believing to be true, (not
that they were moved with compassion for my loss) but respecting their own
particular benefit, hoping to get a booty by them that had robbed me,
scattered themselves in companies to find them out, where they stayed so long,
that the shepherd and his wife went out of the house, and thinking to have
their parts, left me alone with the child, that not long after I took in mine
arms, and went away. But as it fell out, the nurse came in, and missing the
child, called to them for help, who running in great have, followed me so
fast, (that had it not ben for night that ouertooke them) and the great fire
you found about me, I had never escaped their hands. And what would they have
done with this poor infant (said Manely?) You shall understand (said she) that
the son of Garadan having conceived a mortal hatred against the Emperor,
either because he could not have the entertainment he thought he had
deserved, or else grieved (as I think) that he could not attain unto the
Empire, as he pretended: determined not only to revenge himself upon this
little child, but to kill the Emperor likewise if ever he have the means. By
God (said the king of Denmark) he is a wicked and cruel hearted man, but
assure your self that God will not permit it to be so. Nevertheless I am in
doubt this child will endure much woe, seeing you have no means to give it
suck. Let me alone with that (said Vrganda) for I have certain herbs about
me, with the juice whereof I will nourish it, if need be eight days together.
What (said he) will you then stay here so long? No (said Vrganda) for as
soon as it is day I will return unto my boat that staieth here at the shore.
But madame (said they) what shall become of us? for we are arrived here, not
knowing who brought us hither. But for Gods sake, if you have heard any news
of our companions, let us knew it, and where we may go to find them. My
friends (said she) you must first let desteny have his course, and endure many
hard adventures, and when time serves you shall have your desires. And in that
manner sometimes talking and sometimes sleeping, they passed the time away till
day began to appear, when they three together went to the sea side, where they
entered into Vrgandas boat, wherein four Gentlewomen and two dwarfes stayed
for her.

CHAP. XVII. How Vrganda departed from the two knights, and being guarded by
two dragons went unto the Emperors court, to deliver them their young son,
for the loss whereof all the court was in an uproar.
FOr a time Vrganda stayed with the two knights, not minding presently to ease
the Emperors mind with the recovery of his son, in the end she caused them
to return unto their bark, willing them from that time forwards to arm
themselves against the assaults of fortune, although she seemed never so
variable and unconstant. For (said she) therefore was ye order of knighthood
instituted and appointed, that thereby it might appear more excellent. And
they were no sooner departed, but she set foot on land, and mounted on a
palfrey with the child in her lap, she rude forward, with two dragons to
guard her, one upon her right hand, the other upon the left, that bare her
company till she came to Triol, where the Emperor held his court. And
approaching the Town, she met great companies of knights that went to seek the
child, who seeing those horrible beasts casting fire out of their mouths, for
fear they began to fly, whereat Vrganda smiled. At the last Florestan king of
Sardinia coming that way, (having ridden a great compass about to pursue
Garadans son) and returning as then all weary and sore travailed with his
horse tired, perceiving the people to run so fast, asked them the cause,
wherewith they showed him a far off what they had seen, but he not abashed,
went toward the dragons, thinking if it were possible to fight with them, and
as he came nearer unto them, he knew Vrganda, and spurring his horse, he
thought to salute her, but the more he pricked him forwards, the more the horse
gave back, whereby he was constrained to light down, and saluting her, he
took her by the hand, but the dragons vanished away, whereat he was abashed,
which Vrganda perceiving, said unto him: In faith sir knight, they have good
cause to give you place, knowing well the magnanimity of your invincible
courage. And for my part, I esteem my self better guarded (being in your
company) then I did before, wherefore I pray you leave me not, till I have
delivered this child unto his mother, which I have recovered from the villains
that had stolen it from her. Is it possible madame (said Florestan) that the
emperor should receive so great a pleasure by your means? Show me. I pray you
(if it pleases you) how you procured the same? You shall know it (said she)
when time serves, till then content your self, and mounting on horseback, I
pray you bring me to the city of Triol. With that they rode together till
they came to the Emperors court, where they found the Empress half dead for
sorrow, but when she heard the good news Vrganda brought, her sorrow turned
to exceeding joy. And for that the emperor being armed, was ridden out to
seek the child, as others did, she sent men on all sides to certefie him
thereof, he having intelligence, thanked God with all his heart, and turned
back to see Vrganda, that told him in what manner she found the child, as you
have heard before. Where we leave her, and return to show you of Manely and
the king of Denmark, who in ye mean time were at sea in so horrible a tempest,
that they thought to have been drowned.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the strange adventures that the king of Denmark and Manely
had, after they departed from Vrganda, and what pastime they had with two great
apes in an Island, where by chance they arrived.
AFter the king of Denmark and Manely departed from Vrganda, they entered into
their bark, where their two Squires stayed for them, and so embarked,
presently hoised sail and put to sea, the weather very peaceable and calm:
but they had not sailed long, when a contrary wind began to rise, wherewith ye
waters grew so high, and the sea began to swell so big, that one while it
seemed to mount unto the skies, and again to descend as low as the
bottomless pit of hell, whereby their little bark, was oftentimes covered
with water, having neither maste, sail, nor cable, but all rent in pieces. And
that which abashed the^ most was, that night coming upon them, it was so
dark, they could not see the length of their boat, in which torment they
continued for the space of thirty days together, till at the length it cast
them upon an Island, where (being arrived about sun setting) they landed.
Then commanding one of their squires to keep their boat, being armed at all
points, they went into the Island to see if they could find any fresh water or
other victuals, for they had not sufficient in their bark to serve them for a
week, at the last they found a goodly fountain, shadowed with many great
trees, whereby they sat them down, and putting off their helmets for to
drink, Argenton their squire that was with them, said unto them: if you
think good, gou shall stay here while I go up this high rock, where (it may
be) I shall find a house, or some country man that will show us in what place we
are arrived? Go (said the king of Denmark) but take heed thou loosest not
thy self. With that the squire left them, and took his way through the wood,
but he had not gone a long bows shot, when he perceived a great Bear coming
toward him, wherewith he was in such fear, that with a loud voice he cried
out for help, and finding no other remedy, he was constrained to climb into
a high tree. The knights hearing their squires cry, supposed he had need of
them, and with that they ran in such have to help him, that forgetting their
helmets behind them, left them by the fountain, and they had not run far,
but they espied the Bear climbing against the tree, wherein the Squire was
defending himself as well as he could, but the beast forsaking her first pray,
ran unto Manely, being next unto her, thinking at the first encounter to
throw him on the ground, but he stepping aside, gave her such a blow with his
sword, that therewith he cut off one of her ears with a piece of her iaw, but
the Bear turned again, and taking him most fiercely about the body thought to
strangle him, wherewith he had almost lost his breath, when the king of Denmark
came unto her, and with one blow cut one of her legs clean from the body,
whereby the beast in great anguish forsaking her pray, fled into the thicket of
the wood, and the king after her, and longer had followed, had it not ben for
the weight of his armor, that wearied him overmuch, wherefore returning again
unto his companion, they two help their Squire Argenton to come down the tree,
who as yet for fear trembled like a leaf, whereat they both began to laugh,
Manely asking him if he were a cold, no (said he) but I was in the greatest
fear that ever I had in all my life, or ever I hope shall have again, and
surely I believe there are no other people in this Island, then devils
disguised in strange forms, or else such proper Gentlewomen, as she that of
late embraced you so courteously, wherefore I am of this opinion, that for our
better security, it were best for us to stay by the fountain, or in our bark
till the sea be somewhat pacefied. In truth thou say well (said the king
of Denmark) but in the mean time be thou of a good courage and fear
nothing, I know not what courage I should have (said he) but I pray you for
Gods sake let us be gone, unless you will see me die here. As far as I see
(said Manely) thou will never die in fight, as long as thou find means to
run away. Not if I may (said Argenton) for if I should, it were done but
like a fool. In which manner talking together, they came unto the fountain,
where they espied two old apes casting their helmets (they had left behind
them) one at the other, as lightly as if they had been at Tennise, whereat the
two knights and Argenton laughed so heartily, that they were almost overcome
with laughter: for the apes had no sooner spied them coming, but in great have
they put the helmets on their heads, and climbing up the trees, skipped from
branch to branch, sometimes up and sometimes down, like two tumblers. As God
help me (said Manely) I like these apes well, for they knew we were so
melancholy on the sea, that they meant to make us merry on land, yet I trust
they shall not carry away my arms without a combat. Wherewith they took up
stones and threw at them, but they turning about, grinned with their teeth,
making mouths and mowes, sometimes scratching their arses. Wherewith the king
of Denmark took such pleasure, that he desired Manely and Argenton to let
the apes alone, and as then it began to be night. Wherefore they sent their
squire to fetch his companion, with the rest of the victuals they had in their
bark, because the sea rose so high, that they doubted their bark would be
cast on shore, and break in pieces, who stayed not long before they came
again, and after the knights had eaten of such victuals as they had, they put
off their armor, and slept till the next morning, when they awaked, finding
their helmets lying by them, but not their armor, for those new men of war
had put them on so properly, that by their countenaunces it seemed they had
some great combat to fight one against the other, in the top of the high
elmes, whereof there were great plenty. But that sport liked not the two
knights, that were loath to die in that place for want of food, but made their
account, either to put themselves again unto the mercy of the waves, or else
go further into the Island to seek meat. Wherefore making bows of wood, which
they stringed with their garters, and cutting arrows to them, sharp at the
points, they shot at those woody champions so long, that at the last they
compelled them to skip down, whereby they took them, and pulled off their
armor, which done, they let them go, not doing them any hurt.

CHAP. XIX. How Frandalo the Pyrat sailing on the sea, was by tempest of
weather, cast upon the Island where the king of Denmark and Manely were,
against whom he fought, and what happened unto them.
YOu heard before how the king of Denmark and Manely were by fortune cast upon
the isle of apes, where their boat was cast away, they having not victuals
longer then for two days, but God holp them, for the next day as they were
upon the top of one of the highest rocks, they perceived a ship at sea, which
being driven with the wind, not long after was cast upon the shore hard by the
place where they were. Wherewith the two knights went down to speak with them
that were aboard, and calling with a loud voice unto them, there appeared a man
upon the hatches, that asked them what they would. We pray you in courtesy
(said Manely) show us who is the master of your bark, it is (said the man) a
great lord, that before you escape, will make you know how he uses to handle
such youths as you are. And though he do so (said Manely) we are now in such
necessity, that it shall please us well to endure the worst that he can do
unto us, to be rid out of this hunger which we now endure, and still begins
to assail us, wherefore cause us to speak with him, and if it please you, let
us know his name. Those that have fallen into his hands ^saied the man) call
him the devil of the sea, although he is well known by the name of Frandalo,
for by his valor he has brought in subjection the greatest part of all this
sea, pilling and taking all he finds, and by force of weather has been
constrained to put into this Island, his other vessels being scattered so far
(...) hear him named. Notwithstanding one thing overcomes him and
vanquisheth his most courageous heart: which is your grace my good lady (said
she) whom he loves, honors, and desires to serve while life indureth. But
knowing not if his service would be accepted of, he durst not presume to come
himself in person to offer you the same: although (by him that next after your
self, may most command him) he had express charge to present it unto you,
as bound thereto by promise. And to the end you may give credit to my words,
he sends you this ring, which is the very same you gave to Amadis, being in
this Court, if your grace can call it to remembrance. With that Leonorine took
it in her hand, and beholding it long time, she said unto the Gentlewoman:
Truly this ring was sometimes mine, which I gave unto the best knight now
living in the world. In faith (said the Gentlewoman) a better knight then he
has sent it you again, and that is my lord Esplandian his son. I never saw
him, that I know off (said she:) True it is, master Elizabeth told me of a
young Gentleman son to the knight with the green sword, that not long since
was made knight in the Ferme Isle, Vrganda being present, and the next day was
carried away in a strange ship, of whom as then they could bear no news.
Madame (said Carmelle) I know not who the knight with the green sword may be,
but he whereof I show you has had such a beginning in arms, that if it be
your pleasure to hear it, you will be abashed thereat: tell it I pray you
(said the Princess. But as the Gentlewoman began to speak, one brought the
Princess news the Emperor her father was come from hunting, and asked for
her: wherewith she knowing what pleasure her father would take to hear news,
took Carmelle by the hand, and led her into the Emperors chamber, and doing
reverence unto him, she said: My lord, here is a strange Gentlewoman, (that can
tell you news of the good knight with the green sword, and of his son
likewise, of whom master Elizabeth made a long discour^^ and she has been
conducted hither by two knights of the Ferm Isle, whereof one of them has
fought with Frandalo, and has presented him unto me, and staying your return,
I have sent them into a chamber to refresh themselves. Daughter (said the
Emperor) both they and the Gentlewoman are most heartely welcome. My lord
(said Carmelle) God preserve your grace: and without further honor unto him,
she stood still and held her peace, whereat all the company began to smile,
thinking that want of civility caused her to forget her self. But not long
after they changed their opinion, Carmelle beginning to speak in this manner. My
lord, I have been nourished all my life among the best knights living in ye
world, yet let not your grace find it strange, if at the first (being in your
majesty's presence) I have used so little honor to your grace, whereby your
Gentlemen should have cause to laugh at me: For that want of understanding
how to behave my self in presence of so great a Prince is not the cause
thereof, but only the joy I conceive in my self, to be a servant unto him,
whom I more esteem then any man living: and I only hold for my lord and
master, not knowing any worthier then he. And if it pleases your grace to
know who it is, together with the cause of my arrival in this country, I pray
you send for the two knights that brought me hither, and I will show such
things, whereat (it may be) your grace will be abashed. Gentlewoman (said the
Emperor) you shall therein do me great pleasure. Wherewith he commanded a
Gentleman to go fetch the two strange knights, who coming into the Emperors
presence, having kissed his hands, and he welcomed them in courteous manner,
he willed two chaires to be brought, wherein he set them, being a Prince that
always entertained strangers with great honor, especially if he knew them
to be of foreign countries. That done, all the knights, Gentlewomen, and
ladies went near to hear the Gentlewomans speech, when she turning unto the
Emperor, said in this manner: My lord, I think your grace has long before
this time known the castle, called La montaigne defendu, the which (during the
life of valiant Chartadaque, and since that time) you and the king of Turkey
have diverse time assailed to win, although in vain, it has always been so
well defended by the Giants Matroco and Frerion, yet in one day a knight alone
has conquered it, and slain the two giants whereof I spoke, with their uncle
Arcalaus and Argantes the Porter of the same. And which is more, has delivered
king Luisart, that lay prisoner therein, no man knowing it, for he had been
surprised in great Britain, and secretly brought from thence by Arcabonne
lady of the castle: The which lady falling in despair, threw her self out of
a window into the sea. And to the end your grace may know how all has
happened: it is so (said she) that Arcabonne (who as then I served) having
intelligence of her brothers imprisonment in the Ferme Isle, departed
expressly from the castle, hoping to deliver him, but before she got thither,
he was set at liberty. Notwithstanding (she being loath to loose her labor) to
be revenged thereof, did so much by her art, that she got king Luisart (as
then hunting in the forest) into her tent, the king thinking to succor a
Gentlewoman, that as he thought a knight would have defloured: where he was so
cruelly inchaunted, that losing all his senses, he was transported without any
man's knowledge into the dungeon of the castle, where my lord and master found
him. And continuing her discourse, she showed in what manner Esplandian was
made knight, and seeking to find the king, he was carried by the boat of the
great serpent into the Isle of the Enchauntresse, where he conquered the
shining sword, and after that brought in a little bark to the foot of the
rock called La montaigne defendu, the speech he had with the Hermit, the
combats with Argantes, Matroco, and Frerion, the desperateness of Arcabonne,
the determination she had to kill him, when she found him sleeping in the
hermitage, ye love wherewith she was suddenly surprised. And lastly, the means
how king Luisart knew him: for my lord (said she) he is son of Amadis his son,
and of the Princess Oriane. And because at his departure from his father, he
gave him in commandment to come and serve the Princes Leonorine your daughter,
with the other ladies, according to his promise, he has expressly sent me
hither, humbly beseeching the^ to pardon the slow performance of his fathers
will: but to amend his fault committed, he will shortly be here to fulfill his
charge as long as pleases the^. Gentlewoma^ (said ye Emperor) I knew his
father for one of ye best knights living in ye world: notwithstanding you have
showed such strange things of his son, that I certainly believe he far
surpasses him. He shall be heartely welcome when he comes, but if my
daughter will follow my counsel, she shall not pardon his long absence till he
come in person to desire the same: and let him be assured he shall not depart
so soon from hence as Amadis has done. At the least, we will make him so good
cheer, and my daughter likewise, to whom I give express commandment to do
it, that he shall not have occasion to dislike our company. Mean time the two
knights shall remain with us for pledges, assuring you I will give them all the
honor and good intertainement that I can devise. My lord (said she) the desire
they had to understand the things declared to your grace, has caused them for
to come hither, with whom by great good fortune I met, for Frandalo, whom he
(pointing to Manely) has most valiantly conquered, had taken me prisoner, not
far off from the place where I first embarked: but as fortune would, there
rose so great a storm at sea, that all his vessels separated one from the
other, his ship was cast upon an Island, wherein (by the same tempest) these
two knights not long before arrived. And with that she showed what speech they
had with Frandalo, and what passed between them: Wherefore my lord, acquiting
my promise made unto them, I have at large declared the adventures of the good
knight their companion. In faith (said the Emperor) they have showed
themselves right valiant knights, and made a worthy present unto my daughter,
for which I give them thanks. My Lord (said Manely) we humbly beseech your
grace, that from henceforth you will accept his service, for it is his only
desire, as he has promised us. Is that possible (said the Emperor?) For he
is the vildest villain that ever lived on earth, and has more wronged my
subjects then ever any did. My lord (said the king of Denmark) he will become
a new man, and therefore my companion did present him to your daughter, which
promised for to save his life, which we beseech your grace likewise to
perform. I am content to do it (said the Emperor) at your requests, though
he deserves it not. While they sat talking, Gastilles that stayed in the
forest to look unto the hounds, entered into the hal, and presently knew
Manely and the king of Denmark, having seen the^ in great Britain before they
were made knights, where with he asked when they came thither, and being made
acquainted with the Gentlewomans message, he asked her if she knew the names of
the other two that stayed in the castle: for seeing they are armed (said he
unto Manely) in the like arms, it is certain they are of your company. That
is true (said the Gentlewoman) for they were all made knights together, the
one called Ambor, the other Talanque, I know them well (said Gastilles) for
Ambor is the son of Angriote d'estrauaulx, one of the best knights in the
country of great Britain. In truth (said Manely) we were in great care how
to find them out, but seeing they are in the castle called La montaigne
defendu, if it pleases the Emperor, we will go unto them. I am content (said
he) so you promise me not to depart before eight days are past. My lord (said
they) we are at your commandment. Being dinner time, the Emperor rose up and
went into the hall with ye two knights, and the Princess Leonorine took the
Gentlewoman with her as desirous to hear further n^^es of the knight
Esplandian.

CHAP. XXII. What passed between the Princess Leonorine and Carmelle,
touching the message she had brought.
YOu heard before how Carmelle in presence of the Emperor, showed the great
desire she had to slay Esplandian, and when she thought to do it, she was so
overcome with love, that during her life, she determined not to love any
other, which the Princess Leonorine (that already pretended part in him) had
not forgotten, but returned with Carmelle into her chamber: with a smiling
countenance she said unto her. Is it possible Gentlewoman (said she) you
loving the knight with the black arms so w^l as you report, that you could
leave his company so soon? Madame (said she) I was presently given to
understand he loves another: wherewith I comforted my self, judging his heart
like unto mine own, that he could not choose but sometimes feel the like sweet
passion he caused me endure. What hope then rests (said the Princess) unto
you? The same (said she) I know to be far different between him and me,
for when I am in presence, beholding the excellency of his person, I then
receive some comfort, which to him is utterly denied, seeing that already he
indureth for her sake, that as yet he never saw, and the (madame said she) is
your own person, as I said before. Surely (said the Princess) his love is
very strange, the foundation whereof I cannot well conceive. Madame (said
Carmelle) I fear ere it be long, he will not be able to endure the great
extreamitie wherein he now is fallen, only for your sake specially, if at his
arrival here, he find himself rejected of your grace, having no desire, but
to fulfill your pleasure, whereby he may account himself your own, esteeming
it the greatest favor that ever he can have. In good faith (said she) I will
not refuse him to small a thing, nor a greater, as occasion serves, but I pray
you tell me why he calls himself the black knight. That can I not well
do (said Carmelle) only that upon a night as king Luisart ^^e, Talanque and
Ambor, were all asleep in one chamber, they heard so pleasant a sound of
music from the sea, that they rose out of their beds to hear it, and it was
so dark the^ could not s^e, but when day appeared, they espied the great
Serpent at the Haven, whereat they were so glad, that descending down the
hill, they went unto the shore, where they perceived a Gentlewoman in a little
boat coming to land, bearing in her arms a pack covered with blew Taffata:
which from her mistress Vrganda she presented to Esplandian, saying unto him,
Sir Knight, my mistress sends you these arms, and wills you by me to
leave the same she gave you, when you were in sadness, and to arm your self
with these, that bear the devise of her, which at this day is the
beautifullest creature living in the world (as Amadis your father well did
witness, when he set the crown upon her head.) And for ye love of her your
power and courage shall so much increase, that your renown shall spread
throughout the world, your mind moved with so amorous a passion, that many
times you shall desire death. And opening the packet, she took forth a white
armor all set with crowns of gold, enriched with Pearls and Diamonds most
sumptuous to behold. Which Esplandian (with hearty thanks unto Vrganda and the
messenger) received willingly. This as I think madame (said Carmelle) is the
cause why he has been called the black knight, but I suppose seeing he has
changed his devise, he will likewise change his name. The Princess Leonorine
knew thereby, that all these things were said as touching her, wherewith she
felt an alteration in her mind, for that love by little and little began to
burn her heart, which she had willingly covered, but Carmelle by the changing
of her color, which sometimes waxed pale and sometimes red^ the sundry motions
wherewith sweet love did pric^e her (...) heart, perceived it ^ull well in such
manner, that being no longer able to abstain from sighing, as if she had
spoken to her self, she said, I pray God his beginning may prove a happy end.
Wher^with Carmelle perceiving her masters su^^^ prospe^ with effe^t, the
better to increase the desire of the lady, (...) said unto her: madame, he has
commanded me not to stay long here, for till my return he does continue in
exceeding pain, and never shall be free if he receive no comfortable answer
from your ^race. Gentlewoman (said ^he Princess) I were the most ungrateful
Princess living on ^he earth if I should do so, but tell him. I pray you from
me, that I give him hearty thanks for the courtesies he offers me by you,
and when he once arriueth here, he shall soon know ye great good will I bear
him. As also that I hold him for my knight, for proof whereof, you shall on my
behalf present him with this ^airelace, as being the first present that
Grimanaise my grandfather gave to his Appolidon, being but her lover. Wherewith
taking a cloth of tissue from her head, she unbound her hair, and de^iuered the
hairelace unto her, and sending for a gown imbro^ered all with crowns of
gold, gave it her likewise. But (said she) because the two knights have
promised the Emperor not ^o depart from hence till eight days are past, you
shall stay for them, and all together return unto the castle called La
montaigne defendu, which she willingly granted.

CHAP. XXIII. How news was brought unto the Emperor, that Armato king of
Turkey had besieged the castle of La montaigne defendu, and of the charge he
gave Frandalo with Manely and the king of Denmark to go succor it.
IN manner as you heard before, the two knights of the Ferme Isle and Carmelle,
stayed at Constantinople, where there arrived a certain ship, that brought a
Squire on message from Talanque and Ambor to certefie the Emperor, that Armat^
king of Turkey, advertised of the death of Matroco had besieged the castle, La
montaigne defendu both by land and sea, desiring him to send some aid,
otherwise they should be constrained to yield the same, not having victuals
nor men for to defend it. The Emperor hearing those news, and considering the
truce between him and the king of Turks, as also that he had not any men
prepared for to send, neither Gally, Galliace, ship nor Brigandine ready for
the sea, stood somewhat in amase. But considering with himself of what
importance that Frontier castle might be unto him if the enemy should obtain
it, he determined by all means to hinder him from the same. Wherefore calling
for Frandalo, and taking him aside, he said unto him: Well Frandalo, you are
now my prisoner, and it lies in me either to hang you like a thief, or
deliver you with greater riches then ever you possessed, which I promise you to
do, if from this time forwards you swear to be my loiall subject, and
faithfully to serve me when you are employed. My lord (said he) I beseech
your grace wholly to forget the faults by me committed to your Majesty,
swearing of my faith, (if it pleases you to pardon my offense) you shall from
henceforth find a servant of me, that in time will make you know by effect how
much I esteem this favor at your hands. Will you do it (said the Emperor?) I
and it pleases your grace (said he.) What is become of your Navy (said the
Emperor) that in times past you held upon the sea? My lord (said Frandalo)
the winds and tempests that lately happened on the sea, has so scattered them,
that I can hear no news of them: Nevertheless, I am of opinion, they may
easily be brought together, wherewith I will do your grace service, if you
think good. Do it then (said the Emperor) and that with speed, for I have
determined to raise the greatest army that ever has been seen, therewith to
drive Armato king of Turkey out of the Frontiers of my Empire, who not long
since has besieged La montaigne defendu. And while my forces are preparing,
you with the two knights that of late came hither, shall go before, and using
means to assemble your men, shall in the mean time give the Turks somewhat
to do. My lord (said Frandalo) God give me grace to do you faithful service:
then be you ready in the morning (said he) to depart from hence, wherewith he
commanded Frand^^os ship to be rigged and prepared with all things necessary,
and finding Manely and the king of Denmark, he told them that he had received
news from Talanque and Ambor touching the ^astle of La montaigne defendu, and
what he had determined to do as concerning their relief, showing them what
had passed between him and Frandalo touching the same. Wherefore my good
friends (said he) because I well perceive the great desire you have to see
your companions, me thinks it were good you imbark your selves with him, who
goes before to advertise them of the aid I mean to send them. My lord (said
Manely) it is our whole desires. In the morning (said the king) you shall have
your bark ready and furnished with all things necessary, and some other of my
ships likewise to second you, attending the great army my self does mean to
bring. But before their departure he gave them diverse rich presents, which
they refused, contenting themselves with the honor and courteous intertainement
he had already given them, and taking their leave of all the court, especially
of the Princess Leonorine, they took sea, and Carmelle with them, hoping to
have her masters great good will for the good news she brought him. But
before we pass further to show you what became of them, I think it not out of
our hystory to leave Esplandian no longer at Miresleur, but show you what
became of him, being healed of his wounds.

CHAP. XXIIII. How Esplandian healed of his wounds, took leave of king Luisart
and all the court to go unto the Ferme Isle, where he left the great Serpent,
wherein (accompanied only of master Elizabeth and Sergil) he embarked
himself to return unto the castle of La montaigne defendu.
MAny days and nights did Esplandian stay at Miref^eur, after the dangerous
combat between him and Amadis his father, before h^^ wounds were fully healed.
But in the end having license of the king and others that might command him, he
took his way toward the Ferme Isle, accompanied of ^ais^er Elizabeth and
Sergil his squire. And traveling without any ^duenture worthy the rehearsing,
at the last they arrived at the palace of Apolidon, at the foot whereof they
found the great Serpent, wherein presently they embarked themselves, but she
removed not from thence till midnight following, when she began to sail so
swiftly, that the next day they were out of sight of any land, in which manner
they continued for seven days together, the eight day they discovered a goodly
country, and having a calm wind, the Serpent put a shore, which Esplandian
perceiving, determined to land and walk along the coast, til he found some one
or other, that could show him in what country he had arrived. And desiring
master Elizabeth not to depart thence before he came again, he, Sergil, and
their two horses entered into a little boat, and taking land, they entered so
far into the country, that they came to a little hill, at the foot whereof
they perceived a goodly meddow, and certain houses, whereunto they went. And
they had not ridden far, but a lacquie that kept four horses, whereof one
was a Bay, and greater then the rest, came unto Esplandian, and speaking to him
in the Almaine tongue, asked him why he went to his own mischief? Esplandian
that in his youth had learned that language, asked him wherefore? Because (said
the lacquie) that at the next house my master is newly alighted, and is at
dinner, and if he see you, you die therefore? Thy master (said Esplandian)
And what does he? He uses (said he) to kill or put in prison far brauer
fellows then your self: wherefore if you will believe me, you shall return
again, if you mean not to speed as I have told you. But Esplandian staying
not, passed forward till he came unto the door, where he espied a Giant set at
dinner, and four squires all bareheaded waiting on the board. But as soon as
the Giant saw him, he rose up, and leaning on the cloth, said unto him: Thou
unhappy wretch, wh^ has sent thee ^^ther in my presence, armed as thou art? By
my great go. Ia^^s, I m^st needs say thou art a fool, or else art weary (...)
thy life. Come hither to me, and put off thine armor because thou shall not
have so much pain to go on foot to thy lodging that is prepared for thee.
Forwards you vilaines said he unto his Squires, throw him off his horse, and
carry him to his fellows. Wherewith one of them (thinking to play the diligent
servant) ran unto Esplandian, to serve him for a Squire: but (whether
Esplandian was offended, or for that he held the left stirrup in stead of the
right) he gave him such a blow on the face with his Gantelet, that he felled
him to the ground: whereat the Giant was in such a rage, that he scarce had the
patience to arm himself to be revenged. Wherefore sending to fetch his great
Bay horse, mounted thereon. Mean time Esplandian lacing his helmet, took his
sword in hand, staying for his enemy that ceased not to threaten him, who
stayed not long before he came, bearing a great lance upon his thigh, and so
great a cimitere hanging at his saddle bow, yt a strange man would have much
ado to lift it up. But as you see a Cock holding up his head, and standing
ready to receive another Cock wherewith he fights, so Esplandian having felt
the injury he had received at the Giants hands, seeing him approach, began to
shake his leg, ready for to charge his enemy. But the Giant called him and
said, Vassaile, Content thy self with the honor thou have already gotten, by
putting me in so great choler, that without any regard I have taken arms
against so vile and wretched a thing as thou art: Fly then from hence without
constraining me to do thee any hurt, otherwise thou art most sure of death, for
twenty knights hardier then thy self, cannot once remove me. Esplandian
hearing his great brags, made no account thereof, but in mockery said unto him.
Those thou have already slain, can never hurt thee, but I that come for to
revenge them, hope before that we depart to send thy soul unto the devil, to
whom thou have commended it so often, although it were much better for thee to
take the counsel thou have given me, and shun thine own misfortune, being well
assured, that in thy great misshapen body there rests nothing but a base an^
servile heart, that causes thee to speak in such sort a^ thou do. That
shall thou presently see (said the Giant) and couching his laun^e, ran
toward Esplandian, who did the like against him: But the Giant missed his
blow, so did not Esplandian, for with the force of his blow he made the Giant
double his body, in such sort, that his Gaul brake in his body, and ran out
at his mouth, where with he presently died. They that beheld it were thereat
abashed, specially the Giants Squires, who presently began to fly, but they
had not run far, when Esplandian ouertooke them, threatening to slay them if
they would not show him the place where their master kept his prisoners,
which they promised to do. And leading him along by the foot of the hill from
whence he had descended, they came into a narrow way full of stones, where
stood a watch of twenty men all armed, each man with a hatchet in his hand to
defend the passage. When the captain of that band perceived the giants squires
coming toward them, he asked the^ where they found that unhappy fellow, and
saying so, thought to lay hands upon Esplandians bridle, but with a blow of
his sword he cut his arm in sunder, wherewith the rest set all upon him. But
in short time he dealt so well among them, that he laid most part of them dead
upon the ground. But he had so many men about him, that in the end his horse
was slain, and he in danger to be ouerthrown. Yet he behaved himself so
valiantly, and with so great a courage, that he remained victor, his enemies
flying as fast as possibly they might: and among the rest, the laquie that he
found keeping the four horses, who saving himself in a vaut, cried with a
loud voice and said, Come forth my lord, come forth, your son Bramato is
slain, and all our companions likewise. With that there appeared a great old
Giant with a long white beard, who seeing Esplandian with his sword bloody in
his hand, and most of his men lying dead about him, he cast out a great sigh
and said, O immortal Gods, wherein have I so much offended you, that you
should suffer my only son and all my men to be slain in such manner by this
one knight? But I hope your wraths will not be so much increased against me, as
that you will not give me leave to be revenged on him. And as he uttered those
words, being covered with his shield, he went unto Esplandian, and holding
his sword in hand, stroke him flatl^ng with the same upon the arm, in such
manner that he was astonished: and with the force of the blow the sword sliding
down upon a stone, brake in three pieces, wherewith Esplandian stepped to him,
and with great dexterity struck him so fiercely on the face, that the blood in
great abundance ran out of his forehead. Whereat the Giant was in such a rage,
that casting down his shield, took the piece of his sword in both his hands,
and with all his force struck at Esplandian that stepped aside, and perceiving
the Giants arm coming toward him, with one blow cut off his hand, whereby
his sword fell down. Nevertheless he seemed not abashed, but embracing
Esplandian with his left arm, thought to crush the breath out of his body, but
it happened otherwise, for as he held him, Esplandian having his right arm at
liberty, thrust his sword into the Giants body, wherewith he died. The^
calling Bramatos three squires that he brought thither to show him the
prisoners, he asked where they were: My lord said one of them, on that side
the vaut is the two Giants lodgings, that you have slain, and under it are the
prisoners that you seek in a most dark prison above a hundred paces long, and
but two paces broad, whereby the prisoners (in great number) have no means to
rest themselves, being constrained to stand upright for the narrowness of the
place. Go before (said Esplandian) with that the squire went forward, and
Esplandian followed after, and they had not gone long, but they entered into a
goodly palace, and going lower, he heard the lamentable voices of the poor
prisoners dying for want of food, whereat he took such compassion, that the
tears ran down his eyes, asking the squire for the keys? there they hang
(said he) upon a nail. Open the door (said Esplandian) which he presently did,
wherein they entered, and Esplandian calling the poor wretches that lamented,
said unto them. My good friends, come all forth, and thank God for your
liberties. You may well judge if they were glad to hear those news, for that
some of them had remained therein above thirty years together, being in all
twenty Gentlewomen, thirty squires, and fifty knights, among the which
Esplandian knew Gandalin and Lazinde, who by evil fortune (after the conquest
of Sansuegue) travailing the country, were met by the Giants, and kept in
prison with the rest, where they endured great misery.

CHAP. XXV. How Esplandian commanded the prisoners he had delivered to go unto
Constantinople, there to thank the Princess Leonorine the Emperors daughter,
keeping only Gandalin and Lazinde with him.
THe Giants slain, and ye prisoners set at liberty, Esplandian that as yet had
not taken off his helmet, not long after made himself known to Gandalin and
Lazinde, yt were no less abashed to see him in so strange a place, then
wondered at the great Prowess he had showed for their delivery. It was then
about sunnesetting, and Esplandian had neither eat nor drunk of all that day,
wherefore he determined not to depart thence till the next day in the morning,
for he found great store of victuals in the place: Commanding Sergil with one
of the squires to go seek the Bay horse he left at the house where he slew
Bramato, for his own was slain, which they presently brought unto him,
passing the night in the Giants house with the best victuals they could find.
The next day in the morning Esplandian called the prisoners that he had
delivered, asking them what they meant to do? Sir Knight (said they) we are
wholly bent to do as pleases you. Then my friends (said he) you shall go to
Constantinople, and there give thanks unto the Princess Leonorine for the
grace it has pleased G^d to give you by means of a knight that belongs unto
her. An^ if she asks you my name, tell her only what manner of arms I
bear, showing her that I willed you to submit your self unto her mercy. In
faith (said Gandalin) my companion and I were determined not to leave your
company so soon, but seeing it is your pleasure, we are content to do it.
You and he (said Esplandian) shall keep me company till you mean to travail
further, the rest shall do as I required them. Sir Knight (said he) that
showed him the prison, they shall find within the house all the furnitures and
other things that were taken from them: show them where they be (said
Esplandian.) Whereunto he willingly obayed, which done, they all left the
Giants house, the prisoners taking the way toward Constantinople, and
Esplandian with Gandalin and Lazinde, armed at all points, went toward master
Elizabeth that stayed for them in the great Serpent, and as they were about
half a mile from the Giants house, they met a knight all armed with two
squires attending on him, who in courteous manner saluting Esplandian and his
company, asked them what country men they were. Sir knight (said Esplandian)
we are all of great Brittaigne. Alas (said he) can you tell me any news
touching a thing that has grieved me full sore? What is that (said
Esplandian) can you tell me (said he) what is become of king Luisart? For I
have been certefied of a truth that he is lost, not knowing where, how, nor for
what cause. And for my part I swear unto you, I have already sought for him in
diverse countries, and can hear no news at all, and I am determined never to
leave travailing before he be found again, if it be possible for mortal man to
do it. You are bound thereunto (said Esplandian) seeing he deserves it, as
you know right well: Nevertheless if it pleases you to put off your helmet,
and make you known unto us, that have been bred and nourished in his house, I
assure you we will satisfy your mind so well as touching him, that you cannot
choose but like it. My lords (said he, putting off his helmet) I am Norandel
his son. When Esplandian and the rest perceived that, they made themselves
known unto him, embracing each other most courteously. Ha m^ lord (said
Norandel) I pray you for Gods cause, if you know any thing touching the king,
hide it not from me. Uncle (said Esplandian) about a month hence I left him
at Mirefleur in good health God be thanked, making good cheer: showing him in
what manner he had delivered him out of prison, wiih all that passed touching
the same. I marvel then (said Norandel) what adventure brought you hither. By
my soul (said Esplandian) that can I not well tell, only that I was brought
hither by the great Serpent which I left at the sea side, wherein master
Elizabeth staieth for me. Then he showed him how he departed from the court,
his arrival in the Ferme Isle, his imbarking to take sea, and what time they
were at sea before they discovered any land, till in the end (said he) we
espied this country, where Sergil and I took land, in good time for Gandalin
and Lazinde, as hereafter they may show you. But you (said he to Norandel)
tell me of your faith, how was it your chance in so good time to meet with us?
In truth (said Norandel) the peace made between Amadis and the king, I
departed from the court to seek some strange adventures that commonly are found
in this country of Almaigne, where I had no sooner arrived, but I had certain
news of my fathers absence, whereat I was so grieved, that to find him out I
have travailed the countries of Denmark, Poland, Russia, Sweathland, Hungary,
and all this country even unto this place, where it is said there dwells two
giants, who as they are all of one nature, exercise innumerable cruelties
against those they meet, the younger of them waiting continually about this
place for such as pass this way. And therefore when I saw you first, I thought
one of you three to be the Giant, thinking to fight with him, or lose my life
therefore: which I will yet do if you let me pass. By God (said Gandalin) you
lost your labor seeking for the king, so shall you likewise do if you take
this enterprise in hand? Wherefore (said Norandel,) Because (said he) you see
him here in presence that eases you of that burden. With that he showed him
in what manner Esplandian had fought with the Giants, and how he, Lazinde, and
diverse others were prisoners in their house, from whence Esplandian had
delivered them. Before God (said Norandel) the news likes me well, for I
never thought in long time any such adventure would have happened unto him, not
knowing he had received the order of knighhood. You see it is so (said
Esplandian) and master Elizabeth can tell you more, if it pleases you to go
with us. Let us go then (said Norandel) for I would gladly see him: With that
they rode toward the sea, till they espied the great Serpent, wherein they
embarked themselves: where Norandel, Gandalin, and Lazinde, understood by
master Elizabeth what had happened to Esplandian from the day he received the
order of knighthood. And although Norandel determined with all speed to return
into great Brittaigne, yet he changed his mind when he heard so strange and
maruailous news of his nephew Esplandian, to who^ he said: My lord, seeing
fortune has brought us so well together, I pray you let me not leave your
company till some occasion be ministered unto us. Uncle (said Esplandian) I am
content, and I pray you let it be so. In that manner they passed the rest of
the day in the great Serpent, minding the next day because she stirred not to
take land again to see if they could find any more adventures: And they had
scarce fallen asleep, but the Serpent began of it self to sail forward so
swiftly, that by sun rising they had lost the sight of any land, not ceasing
for to sail six days together before they espied land: the seventh day when
the sun began to shine, it stayed at the Isle Saint Mary, which master
Elizabeth presently knew, as having ben there before with Amadis de Gaul, when
he fought with Landriaque: wherefore he said unto the knights. In good faith,
I remember that once as I travailed on the sea with my lord Amadis, we were
cast upon this Island by so great a tempest, that we thought verily to have
been drowned. And if then at sea we had great fear of death, being landed,
our fear did more increase, and that with so good cause, that I cannot choose
but tremble to remember it. What (said Esplandian?) Can a danger so long time
past breed so great a fear as you seem to have? Sir (said master Elizabeth)
some men to hide the truth, make a great matter of a small, but if you had seen
as much as I then saw, and that which as yet you may behold, if it pleases you
to go where I was once, you shall find that I have no less occasion, and
there is Gandalin that can witness it as well as I. I pray you bring us thither
(said Esplandian) with that they caused the horses to be vnshipt, and going to
land, they mounted up the Island, til they came to the castle where Amadis
stayed certain days to be healed of his wounds, where they found a knight that
kept it forth Emperor, who being advertised by master Elizabeth what knights
they were he had brought thither, bad them heartely welcome, offering them all
the pleasure he could show, but they staying not there, went forwards to the
place where Amadis fought with Landriaque, where the Emperor had erected both
their Images so like unto them, yt there wanted only life to express the same:
Which master Elizabeth showed unto the knights, and to the end (said he) you
believe me better another time, I pray you behold well the form of this great
devil, who before my lord Amadis arrived had utterly destroyed this most
fertile Island. And therewith he showed them from point to point what had
passed touching the same, as you have heard at large set down in the third
book of this our history, whereat they were all abashed, especially to think
how Landriaque could be slain or overcome by one knight alone. For although
this image were but a senseless thing, yet it made the^ abashed, which having
long time beheld, and visiting other places worthy memory, they returned to the
great Serpent, which presently departed from the Isle, and with a good wind,
in five days after arrived within half a mile of Constantinople, where it
began to cast forth fire in so furious manner, that the sailors and others that
perceived it, fled all away, doubting the fury of that monster, wherewith the
Citizens were in such a fear, that news was brought unto the Emperor, who
as then was talking with the ladies, whom he led unto the towers of his palace
to see what it might be, when they perceived the great Serpent, and the sea
raging so sore about it, that it seemed a gulf of fire, wherewith they were in
such a fear, and the Emperor likewise, that he commanded al men to be armed,
fearing it would come into the Town, and so destroy them al. But Gastilles
that had seen it oftentimes, assured the Emperor that it was ye ship of the
knight Esplandian, which Vrganda brought first into great Brittaigne. And to
the end my lord (said he) you shall not doubt thereof, if it pleases you I
will go see if the son of Amadis be there, and bring him unto you. Do so I
pray you (said the Emperor.) With that G^stilles went unto the Haven, entering
into a Gally that he found ready to put to sea, commanding the master thereof
to row unto the great Serpent, but whatsoever he could say, the master would
not stir one foot, till such time he threatened him with fear of being
hanged. Wherefore hoising up his anchor, the company began to row forward, but
it was impossible for them to come near the Serpent by a good bow shot, and
withal the sea it was so hie, that the waves cast them back again into the
Haven with so great a force, that the Gally was in danger to be cast away.
Which the Princess Leonorine perceiving, (who till then thought assuredly
Esplandian had expressly come thither for to see her) began to despair of her
good hope, and making her complaint, said unto her self: Alas monster, ship,
Gally, or what vessel soever thou art, wherefore art thou now so cruel unto
me, in not suffering him that is within thee to land at this our Haven, to the
end mine eyes might enjoy his presence, but rather as if thou had conceived
a jealousy toward us, thou use all means possible to hinder the ship
wherein my cousin Gastilles saileth, not to approach near thee, that he might
bring him hither, or at the least that we might hear some news of him. But in
faith, all well waied and considred, I think thee rather to have reason, and my
self without consideration, for that so excellent a thing ought not to be so
lightly set at liberty. Therefore it is no marvel if thou refuse him unto
us, fearing least thou should loose him, seeing thou may well vaunt yt in
thee there rests so valerous knight, as in regard of him all others may be
naught esteemed. I would to God, that we being both together, might never
depart out of thy body: for being with him, his only presence would breed in
me so much contentment, that I should think my self to have attained unto
the top of all felicity: and if his love be such as Carmelle has assured me,
it cannot be, but that he suffers the like passion I now endure, by overmuch
desire to see his person. Wherewith she remained in such an ecstasy, that by
the changing of her color, it might easily be judged her heart was not at
ease, which in the end compelled her to sigh: and at the same instant to repent
the speeches she had used unto Carmelle, as also of the rich gown that she
gave unto her. For (said she unto her self) what know I, if my sweet friend
seeing her apparrelled therein, would embrace her, not for the love of her, but
for the gown that once belonged unto me. And if it be so, it is not to be
doubted, but she will by all means seek to join her lips to his, yea and
her body like wise: which would be worse, seeing she is neither so evil
favored nor of so bad behavior, but it may be in a heat he would both forget
himself and me. But out alas what said I? Truly I do him wrong to be so
jealous of him, considering the chaste love that is between them both, and
therefore if it so fall out, that in respect of me he shall embrace her body,
beholding her apparrelled in a thing that sometimes served me, it will be much
more glory unto me till I my self may once embrace his body, as in time I
doubt not but I shall. But if Leonorine were in pain, Esplandian had no less,
both solicited with like jealousy, for the great distrust of their not
meeting at that time: and gladly would have approached nearer to each other, had
it not been that the one was on land under the government of another man, the
other at sea within a vessel which he could not command. In the mean time the
great Serpent setting forwards, made such speed, that in very short space it
passed the straights of Bosphore. Wherewith the Princess Leonorine was like to
sound, but she refrained it as much as possible she might, fearing to
manifest that, she most desired to keep secret. Whereby she withdrew her self
half dead into her chamber, and making as if she desired to sleep, threw her
self on her bed, commanding her Gentle women to depart the chamber: they being
gone, she began again to renew her sorrow, and almost drowned in tears, said
unto her self: Alas, now I surely see and well perceive my grief to be wholly
without remedy, having seen the thing (that in all the world I most entirely
love) so near unto me, and at one instant so suddenly to depart, that it is
uncertain whether he is gone. Ha cruel torment that still increases in me so
covertly, is it possible that from henceforth I can so well dissemble as yet I
have done? Truly no, for if in time past I enforced my self to esteem the
desire I had a singular pleasure unto me, now seeing I well perceive my
accursed fortune to approach, and my joy to fade, in manner as soon as it was
conceived, I desire naught but death: which to me would be more acceptable,
then live in so great pain, not hoping any ease. And leaving so, she gave so
great a sigh, that Queen Minoresse heard it: Who fearing she had been sick,
opened the chamber door, asking her how she did. Wherewith the Princess
perceauing that discovery, to excuse her self the best she could, she told
the Queen she dreamed. Madame (said the Queen) it is not long since the
Emperesse sent to see what you were doing? Is it not your pleasure to rise and
go unto her? Let us go (said she.) In the mean time Esplandian with his
companions, sailed so long, that within two days after they perceived the
rock of La montaigne defendu, and not far from them the vessels and men of
war Frandalo had assembled, that stayed for a wind to surprise the Turkish
Army on the sea: who perceauing the great Serpent making toward them, began to
arm themselves, thinking that it had been some monster that came to devour
them. But Manely and the King of Denmark that had seen it oftentimes before,
were very glad, giving them to understand what succors they might have
thereby, whereat they all reioiced, specially when they perceived Esplandian,
Gandalin, and the rest, that Manely and the king of Denmark knew, wherefore
causing a boat to be made ready, they with Frandalo and Argenton, the king of
Denmarkes Squire (a very good mariner) entered into it, and rowing to the
great Serpent, Esplandian received them with great joy, asking Manely what
fortune had brought them thither. In faith (said he) it is not long since we
departed from the city of Constantinople, to discover and to hinder the
passage of victuals that are daily brought by sea from the Town of Norolia
unto Armato king of Turks, who not long sithence has besieged the castle of La
montaigne defendu: expecting daily the coming of the Emperor with a great
army to drive the Turk from thence. But we have had so contrary a wind, that
it has been impossible for us to effect our charge. In good truth (said
Esplandian) I would never have sought you in these countries, neither do I
know what became of you after we fell asleep in this vessel, I pray you
tell it us. Then Manely began to show how he and the king of Denmark when they
awaked found themselves in a bark upon the coast of Italy, where taking land
they found Vrganda, and after that by cruel tempests they arrived in an Isle,
where a Bear assailed them, in which Isle they saw two great apes that showed
them much sport. But (said he) we thought to have starued therein for want
of meat, for our victuals were clean consumed when by fortune Frandalo arrived
in the same Isle, with whom I fought and overcame him. And because our bark
was cast away, we entered into his, wherein we found a Gentlewoman that told
us news of you, whom for your sake we conducted unto Constantinople, and from
thence have brought her back again. As far as I understand (said
Esplandian) you have not always slept, and I believe that never any knight had
fo strange adventures at their first entering into arms unless it were my
lord Amadis my father, which I would hardly have believed, had it not ben for
the signs and evident tokens that we saw in the Isle Saint Mary. What were
they (said the king of Denmark?) We saw the Image of Landriaque (said
Esplandian) with whom he had so long and perrillous a combat. It is true
(said Argenton) that such combats against monsters, do oftentimes strike the
hardiest knights with fear, and the combat of our Apes made sorrowful
knights rejoice. In good faith said Esplandian) thou have reason, and I like
thee well for thy mirth, but I pray thee heartely return again, and fetch the
Gentlewoman that is in thy masters ship, and bring her hither, that I may
speak with her, which he presently did: and as she entered into the great
Serpent, Esplandian embracing her, asked if she had seen the emperor and the
beautiful Princess Leonorine his daughter. I my lord (said she) both of them
desiring your arriual in that country, especially the Princess Leonorine,
with all the ladies and Gentlewomen, being fully determined not to pardon the
great fault you have committed in their behalfes, to have deferred off so long
before you come to serve them, according to the promise made by Amadis your
father, as I assured the^. Yet I think their displeasure is not so great, but
ye may well find means to pacefie the same. My good friend (said Esplandian)
you are heartely welcome, we will talk together when better leisure serves.
Which he said, fearing she should have proceeded further, wherewith the
standers by might have intelligence of the love he bare unto the Princess,
wherefore leaving the Gentlewoman, and turning to Manely, he said: In faith I
cannot well excuse my self, but that I do them wrong, for the first
commandment my father gave me at such time I received the order of
knighthood was, that in his place I should go and serve them, to quit the
promise he had made. Nevertheless fortune has ever sithence given me so many
crosses thereby to hinder my intent, that I could neither fulfill his will, nor
satisfy their expectations. While they were thus devising, two of Frandalos
Brigantines, that by him were sent to espy the enemies navy, brought news they
had seen great numbers of their Foistes and Galleys sailing to the East, to
fetch victuals for the Navy, and that the rest that remained behind would
easily be overcome, if it pleased them to set upon them: which the knights
understanding, were of opinion, that without longer delay they would assail
them, and presently therewith hoised up their ankers, making as secretly as
they could toward Armatos fleet, yet they determined not to set upon them
before the break of day, hoping to take them sleeping, which in truth fell
out. The first that set upon them was the great Serpent, that at her arrival,
entering among the enemies, cast fire so fiercely at her mouth and nosthrils,
that when they awaked it put them in such fear, that losing courage without
stroke given, they all began to fly: Nevertheless it could not save their
lives, but that the greatest part of their vessels were drowned by means of a
contrary wind, that rose so suddenly on the sea, whereby it raged in such
sort, that neither mast, sail, board, nor oar could hold, but were broken all
in pieces: yet did not Frandalo lose any of his fleet, neither did the camp
once move thereat, for they were not seen of any other then the sentinel of
the castle, that presently told Ambor and Talanque, whereat they received great
pleasure, especially when they espied the great Serpent and Esplandian there
(...) with whom they talked long time before he came to land. At the last
they concluded to avoid all danger, that the rampires they had made before the
gate, should for that time not be broken, but they would let down a lather of
cords, whereby they might mount up into the castle, Frandalo having given order
for the safety of his ships, which was presently done.

CHAP. XXVI. How Armato king of Turkey had intelligence of the overthrow of his
army at sea by Frandalo and his company, and what enterprises happened on both
parts.
THat aid entered into the castle of La montaigne defendu, Esplandian desirous
to see the enemies camp, presently mounted upon the walls, accompanied only of
Talanque and Ambor, that showed him the tents of Armato, the Bassias,
Begberbeys, and Sangiaces, whereof some were lodged within the Base court,
which they had conquered at their first coming thither, wherewith Esplandian
was much grieved, and asked Talanque how he suffered them to come so near.
Assure your self (said he) it was not with our wills, but we defended it as
long as possible we might, and the Portaile like wise, which at their first
coming they assailed. But we defended it so well, that without their mine they
had never won it, yet did it profit them but little, for that suddenly we
destroyed all their mine, that had cost them fifteen days labor. Which Armato
perceiving, sought to begin again, which we by diverse sallies would not suffer
him to do: but whatsoever we could do, in the end their force prevailed, and
we constrained to forsake the same, and retire unto the castle, and that in
good time, for we were scarce entered into the dungeon, but they fired it,
whereby the Portall fell down, giving us at that time one of the most cruel
assaults that ever place sustained, being so meanly guarded as it was, and
assure your self, that there is neither loopehole nor window, but they raised
ladders or some other engines against it, and with lances, fire, and sword,
gave us so much to do, that we were in doubt to be overcome. Nevertheless
they were as whotely repulsed, for Libee gave them such intertainement with a
dram of powder, that he set on fire, as they began to cry out victory, but
upon a sudden their cry became so pitiful, that nothing but sorrow and
lamentation could be heard among them, where with there were so many of them
burnt and singed, that never since they durst approach so near, although we
have given them diverse skirmishes, but for the space of eight days we never
issued forth, by reason (as you know) if we should often issue forth, it is
impossible but some of our men must of force be slain, and the death of one
of ours would be more loss unto us then the slaying of a hundredth of their men
would profit us. You have done well (said Esplandian) for all wise captains
ought to content themselves with the sure defending of a hold committed unto
them, not hazarding themselves to loss as long as possible they may. But for
the further safety of this castle, I think it good we take counsel what
were best to be done, least we be surprised. Wherewith they went into the
chamber where Matroco died, where they met together, and (among diverse things
propounded) it was concluded, that ye next night they would issue forth to slay
ye enemies watch, which would easily be done, seeing they had not any alarm
in long time before. Wherefore every man went to refresh himself, till about
eleven of the clock at night, when Frandalo and the rest armed themselves. And
as they were all assembled in the court, Esplandian standing in the middle,
spoke unto them and said, My good friends, we are not now among the combats
of great Brittaigne, where combats are fought more for fantasy, or vain
glory, then upon any just occasion: But this war we make against the proper
enemies of our faith, summoneth us not only to do our endeavors, but also to
defend the honor and liberty of the name of Christians. Wherefore my good
companions, I beseech you let every man cast fear aside, preferring virtue
before any inconvenience whatsoever. Assuring you (if we do so) that before
it be day, king Armato and his army shall well find, we are not so fainthearted
as he esteems us. Then calling Norandel unto him, he said: Uncle, you, Manely
and the king of Denmark with a hundred men, shall issue first to flay the
Sentinels, and if you could do the like unto their watch, our enterprise would
be brought to pass as we desire. But whatsoever chances, set you upon them,
and fear not the repulse, for Gandalin and Lazinde shall second you with two
hundredth more, by which means you may easily retire if you be constrained
thereunto. Nevertheless, let no man stir from hence, till Frandalo and I be
first gone out, for that we two alone will go into their camp to see what
countenance they make, and as fortune favors us, we will presently join
with you. With that he sent for two gowns of cloth of gold, and two Turkish
caps, whereof he gave one unto Frandalo, and kept the other for himself, and
being armed under their apparel, were set down (by the ladder of oords) on
the sea side, and fainting to be some of the sea captains, went straight unto
the camp, where they were stayed by the Sentinels, but Frandalo speaking the
Arabian tongue, could so well dissemble, that he made them believe, they went
to advertise the great Turk of a thing of great importance, whereby they let
them pass. Mean time Armato king of Turkey sat devising in his tent with his
familiar friends, touching the loss of ships, whereof not above an hour
before, he had received news by one of his mariners, that saved himself in a
small Frigate: but the Turk could not by any means imagine how it came to
pass, seeing his spies that were newly returned from Constantinople, had
brought him news that the Emperor stirred not, neither made any preparation
to assail him. And as Frandalo and Esplandian entered the tent, they heard the
mariner tell how that cruel overthrow happened by means of a monster of the
sea, that came with the enemies fleet. That (said he) put us in such fear,
with casting fire out of his mouth, nose, and eyes, that thereby the most part
of our men were burnt to ashes. By all my gods (said Armato) it is some devil
that enuieth my prosperity. And it pleases your grace said one of his
Bassaes, (that had sailed in the mediteranian seas, and heard speaking of the
great Serpent) there is nothing but art Magic used therein, whereof I am most
sure, as having diverse times ben certefied thereof. Wherewith they heard a
great alarm, for Norandel and his company had issued out of the castle with
white scarffes about their heads for to be known, and had so well surprised
the watch about the base court, that they had slain them all, whereof Armato
had intelligence, as also that the enemies had gotten the issue of the Portall,
wherewith he was so moved, that in a great rage with very small company he
went thither himself, Esplandian and Frandalo following after, as if they had
been of his company. But before their arrival, Norandel had recovered the
pallasadoes of the fortress, and there sustained the whole Turkish forces,
staying Gandalins coming. Now the entry of the court was so narow, that more
then three men could not pass through it at once, whereby those of the castle
had in manner as much advantage as their enemies. Which Ambor, Talanque,
Gandalin, and Libee made them well feel, coming likewise upon them, for as
the king arrived, they thrust them clean out of the place, whereby they fled
in great have, till the Turk himself caused them to stay, and seeing him,
they took courage, turning their faces, whereby the skirmish began much
whotter then before, Armato himself showing great Prowess, when Esplandian
that was still behind him, took him by the middle, and in dispight of them all,
carried him unto the walls of che castle, crying with a loud voice, Be of good
cheer my companions, we have taken the king. At the which cry the Turks set
so fiercely on them, that had it not ben for Frandalo (who as yet had not
showed himself) they had recovered him again, but he joined himself with
Manely, Norandel, and the rest that sustained the force of all the enemies so
valiantly, that Esplandian had means to put Armato in sure keeping, and to
return again unto the battle before it was ended. But it continued not long
after, for that news was presently carried to the camp, that the king was
prisoner with two of his chief captains, taken by Gandalin and the king of
Denmark, wherewith they were so much abashed, that by little and little they
began to retire, the like did they of the castle, contenting themselves with
the booty they had gotten.

CHAP. XXVII. How Armato king of Turkey was committed unto the custody of
Gandalin, and what conference he had with Frandalo.
THose of the castle retired, as you heard before, Esplandian called Gandalin
and Libee praying them to look unto king Armato, as also to the two Turkish
captains, and appointing the watch as time required, went and laid him down
upon his bed, not ceasing all the night to think on the speech Carmelle used
unto him touching the Princess Leonorine, whereby he could not sleep till
day began to appear, when Frandalo and the rest of his knights entered into his
chamber, to talk with him, not only as touching the intertainement of their
prisoners, but of other things that much imported them. And as they were in
counsel together, Gandalin came unto them, showing them that king Armato
desired for to speak with them, whereupon they went out of the chamber to
hear what he would say. Frandalo could speak the Arabian tongue better then
the rest, for that he had served the king of Turkey, and he knew him very
well, wherefore Esplandian desired him to speak for all the rest. And entering
into the chamber, Frandalo went first, who kneeling on the ground, kissed ye
kings hand. With that Armato thinking he had been prisoner, asked him where
he was taken. My lord (said he) I am now become a Christian, and a knight of
Jesus Christ, that has done me so much grace, not long time since to call me
to be one of his. A Christian (said the king) is that possible? By my soul it
makes me more abashed, then the cruel fortune that is now happened unto me:
for that all knights following arms ought patiently to bear those hazards
that they fall into, using necessity as a virtue. But thou unhappy wretch
(that through fear and want of courage) have forsaken our just and holy law,
wherefore take thou not a rope and hangest thy self, as unworthy to go upon
the earth? My lord (said he) you may say what pleases you, as being
priueledged for the greatness of your estate, yet I can assure you, I never
had so cowardly a heart as you esteem I have, but rather account my self
happy to have done that I have done. Yet will I not refuse to do you service
(my honor still reserved) in any thing I can. With that Armato remembered
himself, and thought he did him wrong, wherefore moderating his choler, he
said unto him: Friend Frandalo, If it greeueth me to have lost you, let it
not seem strange unto you, seeing now I had greater hope then ever I have had
to be served by your means. But seeing it is so, you know how I have used
you heretofore, now I pray you (if you may do any thing for me) to find the
means with your companions that I may be delivered from hence by some
reasonable composition. My lord (said Frandalo, pointing to Esplandian) This
is he that has all power and authority in this place, both over you and me.
With that Armato looked upon him, and perceiving him so young without a beard,
thought Frandalo said it to excuse himself, wherefore he asked if he mocked
him. God forbid I should do so my lord (said Frandalo) but I pray you believe
me, for it is true, that my lord Esplandian standing here before you is he and
none other that slew Matroco, Frerion, Arcalaus the inchanter, and Argantes the
Porter of the castle, which he conquered, as you have been advertised. By my
head (said the king) I would hardly have esteemed him for so brave a man: but
seeing it is so, I pray thee do somewhat with him touching the thing I told
you of even now. Believe me my lord (said Frandalo) there shall want no good
will in me: and with that he bad him God morrow, and leaving him with his
guard, they went into the hall, where they found the tables ready covered for
dinner, for it was about noone time. But as Esplandian rested ill that night,
so he made but a mean dinner, not being able to withdraw his mind from
thinking on the princess Leonorine, which was the cause that the Tables being
uncovered, he went into his chamber, without any company, only the king of
Denmark, whom he loved as himself, where being together, he began to show him
the cause why he sent Carmelle to Constantinople, as also what affection he
bare to the Princess Leonorine. And to the end (said he) you be participant
of my joy, I pray you let us have her here, that she may show us what she
learned in her voyage. My lord (said the king of Denmark) if you saw her
apparrelled in the gown the Princess gave her, I am assured you will scarce
know her at the first. Will you that I send her word to bring it hither? It is
well said (said Esplandian) with that he called a Squire, sending him to
Carmelle, that as the^ was in company of Arcabonnes Gentlewomen: but
understanding Esplandians pleasure, went presently to apparel her self as
he had willed her, and having a mantle on her shoulders because she would not
be seen, went to him in his chamber, where she found him and the king of
Denmark talking together: but as soon as he espied her, he took her in his
arms, and setting her in a chair covered with velvet, said unto her: My
goodfriend, I mean to show my companion you see here, how much I love and
esteem him, wherefore I pray you show me before him what intertainement the
princess Leonorine gave you, knowing you came from me, and whether I find any
favor in her sight. My lord (said she) as soon as I was arrived, and that she
understood the cause of my coming unto her, I found her no less yours then
you hers: whereby I may esteem you the happiest knight living in the world.
And know you why? She is so fair, and of so comely personage, that unless it
be her self none can resemble her, and of truth she does far surpass all
other ladies, for being alone in her private chamber playing on some
instrument, or singing for her pleasure, she steals and rauisheth the hearts
(separated from the bodies of such) as either hear or see her: and if at
sometimes she attireth her self after the Italian manner, with a cap of that
country fashion, then you may see her fair and glistering hair part giving a
certain shadow on her vermilion cheeks, the rest knit up together, inuironing
her head, showing with far better grace then any crown that she could wear,
be it of stones, laurel, or the finest gold that may be found. But if that be
a temptation unto man, her two humble and modest eyes (like two suns) give them
as many deaths, as they at times behold the same, and again reuiueth them
better ^hen at the first, and all at one instant: whereat you must not (...)
abashed, seeing that love it self does often skirmish and strive in them,
thereby to yield both pain and pleasure unto those that do behold the same:
and if he touch her, he fears to hurt her, as being in most extreme
passions of love. And not without a cause, for that nature having made her,
brake the mould, that she might be the only perfect creature, accompanied with
so many virtues, that love finds nothing in her but bones to gnaw upon. And I
assure you my lord, yt speaking unto her of those things you had given me in
charge, I plainly perceived her by the changing of her countenance to be
charged with the like disease whereof you still complain: for sometimes she
blushed, and again became pale, and otherwh^les was at such an exegent, that
she could not answer me a ready word: especially when I presented her with
the ring that she once gave to Am^di your father, as she told me afterward:
In recompense whereof she sends you this hairelace, which she most
earnestly desires you to keep for the love of her, and as the first Jewel
her Grandfather Grimanaise gave to the Emperesse Appolidon, being but her
lover. Expressly sending you the same as an assured token of the love she
bears unto you, and the good will she will be ready always to show you
during her mortal life. With that she took a little box out of her bosom
wrapped in a piece of Taffata, and gave it unto him, which Esplandian received,
and taking it out of the box, he sighed tenderly and said: Ha most fortunate
present, (the first witness of the perfect alliance that the most loiall
lovers that ever lived had together, from whom is descended the Paragon of all
beauty) happy to have approached so near her person: But I much happier that
receives it, as more affectioned to serve her then any other living on the
earth: and it pleases God, while life indureth, I trust thou never shall
depart from me, but I will keep thee as carefully, as I desire she should
hold my heart. Yet this is not all (said Carmelle) but behold the recompense of
my labor, and saying so, she cast the mantle from her shoulders, showing them
her rich gown all covered with crowns of gold, which put Esplandian in mind
of that Vrganda sent him word by her Gentlewoman, when she sent him the white
armor set with the like devise, confirming in his mind the hope that until
then he had holden doubtful: whereat he felt the greatest ease that possible he
might. And as they beheld the great and excellent workmanship, with the great
and costly imbrodery of Pearls and precious stones wherewith it was all
covered, Gandalin came and knocked at the door, to show the that there were a
great number of vessels discovered on the sea, and fearing them to be some new
supply of Turks, was of advise they should be ready to receive them.
Whereupon each man ran to arms, causing more men to go into their ships
for their better safety: yet that alarm continued but a while, for that the
Pennons and Banners of Constantinople were perceived on their ships, by such as
they sent out for to descry the^: some of them coming back again in great
have to show them that Gastilles as general of the army for ye Emperor, was
coming to succor them: whereof the Turks having intelligence, presently brake
up their camp, being gone far from the castle before any of the vessels come
near the shore: Nevertheless, those of the castle set upon their rear ward,
and in the chase slew so great a number, that had not night come on (considring
the evil order they held) there had not escaped a man of all their camp. In
the mean time Gastilles with his army came unto the mountain, where
Esplandian, ye king of Denmark, and diverse others stood ready to receive him:
and after many courtesies and welcomes on all parts given, Gastilles asked them
how they dealt with their enemies. As well as may be (said Esplandian,) but
we could not by any means cause them to stay till your coming, but they are
fled from hence as soon as they heard news thereof: Then he told him of the
larumes and issues by them made during the siege, as also of the taking of king
Armato. That is good news (said Gastilles) God be praised therefore, if mine
uncle the Emperor had been advertised thereof before my departure from
Constantinople, I had not found the means to come send to visit you, which
would have displeased me much, neither would he have been at charge to furnish
such a Navy: but he was in doubt you were in great necessity, that at my
putting to sea he commanded me to make all the speed I could, til he came in
person with four hundred sail yt already are prepared if our forces should not
be sufficient to sustain the Turkish army: but for this year he shall be
excused, if there happen no other adventure. I pray you (said Esplandian) come
to land, and go with us into the castle, where we will confer of all things
with some better leisure: Which he agreed unto, wherewith he and some of the
principal captains of his army, entered into the knights boat, and with them
went up into the castle: where being arrived, Gastilles that knew king Armato)
desired Esplandian before he did any thing else, that he might see him,
wherewith he brought him to the chamber, where he sat as pensive as any man
could be, Gastiles did him honor, as to his estate appertained. But king
Armato would hardly look upon him, but said unto him: Gastilles, I marvel
much why the Emperor your master (contrary to his faith and promise) has
broken the peace agreed upon between us, and for a thing so little importing
him as this place does, whereunto he never had any right, as you well know.
But I perceive from whence the same proceeds: because he would every man
should know the little faith and less loialty that is in him, which I shall
one day make him know full well, if ever I escape out of this prison. My lord
(said Gastilles, your honor saved) the Emperor my master has in him all the
parts that belong unto a wise, virtuous, and hardy Prince, such as he is, and
it seems unto me (under your correction) that by good and just cause he has
done no more then he might do: seeing it is evident that this castle has been
conquered by Christian knights, whom he is bound to favor with all the aid he
can, not only to defend our law, or because they have desired his aid, as
being the first and greatest monarch in the world, but to sustain the right
that both he and his predecessors have always pretended to these marches. And
where you threaten to make him feel the small loialty whereof you accuse him,
at other times heretofore you have met each other with your forces, where you
sped so hardly, that I rather believe you speak in choler then with reason,
specially considering the estate wherein you are at this present. Gastilles
(said Armato,) Although I were dead, I have sufficient number of Captains and
good Soldiers in my country to revenge my cause, and a son likewise, that
is not borne to endure the injury done unto his father: and thus much I assure
thee, that if I thought him to be other, I would slay him with mine own hands
as soon as I should see him. My lord (said Espl^ndian) that Prince, Knight,
or Gentleman that uses such unfit speech as you do now, is commonly holden
for a man of no capacity, especially when he is in a place where humility
rather then threatenings would become him better: Have you already forgotten the
prison wherein you are, and in the hands of those that have so small occasion
to wish you well? My lord, virtue is never better known to be in man, but
then when he is in most distress: Wherefore if until this time you have not
known what constancy does mean, learn hereafter to discern the same, using
words worthy your estate, and not such nor so injurious as you have uttered
unto my lord Gastilles, who in this place represents the person of an
emperor, (a greater lord then you) in whose mercy your life or death
consists: for we are all his soldiers, ready to do him service. The king
perceiving well that he had done them wrong, and fearing to be hardlier used
then he was accustomed to be, said unto Esplandian, Sir Knight, I pray you
pardon my impatience, considring with your self the great greef and melancholy
humor wherein I am, when I (that was wont to be feared and redoubted of all the
princes in Asia) am now constrained to obey the will and pleasure of my
greatest enemies, which unto me is so extreme grief, that I die each day a
hundred times, because I cannot die. But Esplandian answered not one word, but
leaving him with his guard, taking Gastilles by the hand, led him into one of
his best chambers, where they supped. The next day they assembled all together,
and after many matters propounded, it was agreed among them, (according to
Frandalos advise) that they should enter into Turkey, being as then in great
perplexity, as well for the taking of king Armato, as for the overthrow of his
army, as it shall be showed unto you hereafter, for at this time we will
cease to speak thereof: returning to show you of king Luisart, that during
this time, for the most part held his court in the city of London.

CHAP. XXVIII. How the greatest part of the knights that used to be at king
Luisarts court, returned unto their own houses, and of the coronation of
Amadis and Oriane at London.
YOu have heard before of the combat between Esplandian and Amadis his father,
and how after long time of their abode at Mirefleur, staying the healing of
their wounds, Esplandian desiring to return unto the castle La montaigne
defendu, took his leave of king Luisart, the like did diverse of the knights,
that as then were at the Court: as Galaor king of Sobradise, Agraies,
Gransador, Balan, Galuanes, and Angriotte d'estrauaulx, some to see their
wives, others to taste the ease and pleasant rest of their mansion houses:
whereby it happened the court was less replenished with knights then it had
been in long time before, especially by reason of the news they heard from
the castle La montaigne defendu, whether diverse young knights travailed to aid
Esplandian. King Luisart therefore so meanly accompanied as I said before,
being very old and decrepit, began to be melancholy and to have the palsy,
setting aside all Hunting, Hawking, Arms, and Chiualry, or any other pleasure
whatsoever: And with a remembrance of death, so much abhorred all things past,
present and to come, that he esteemed them vain and altogether transitory:
whereby he determined to depose himself of all kingly estate and government of
his realm, to pass the rest of his time in a solitary and religious manner,
specially when he called to mind the great perils from whence he had escaped,
and above all his last most dangerous and cruel imprisonment. Nevertheless,
for a time he kept it secret, until one night he being a bed with the
Queen, where they lay talking of the sicklenesse of this world, he discovered
his whole mind unto her, and how he determined to make Amadis his son king
and governor of his country: to the end he might freely and without any
interruption withdraw himself to his castle of Mirefleur, where (by Gods help)
he meant to live a solitary life. The Queen that was one of the wisest and
deuoutest ladies in her time, confirmed him so well in his opinion, that they
agreed to return to London, there to accomplish their pretense. And the next
day they departed from Mirefleur, accompanied of Amadis, Gransador, and others,
and coming to London, after they had remained there a certain time, the
Queen sent for all the nobility: who being arrived at the court, caused a
scaffold to be made in the principal place of all the city where the people
might repair. And as he and the Queen both apparrelled in their royal robes,
each set in a chair of estate, Amadis sitting somewhat lower on his right hand,
and Oriane on the left, were come thither a Herald crying thrice, that all the
people should keep silence ^ the king with a stately countenance and Princely
magnanimity turning to the people, said unto them. My good friends and loial
subjects, before I begin to show you the cause why I have made you to repair
unto this place, I will put you in mind of part of the dangers and great hazards
wherein I have often fallen since the death of my brother of famous memory king
Falangris, when it pleased God to call me unto the government of this land, and
as I think there are yet many of you living that can well remember the danger
wherein both I and my country thought to fall, when by the means and subtletie
of Arcalaus the inchanter, I was delivered into their hands that long time
before had conspired my death, from whence my son Amadis delivered me: Yet
not long after by evil counsel, I made war against him, which ended as all
men know, fortune envious of my felicity, afterward prepared me such a
banquet, that without his help I had been prisoner with king Arauigne, and
utterly overthrown. And that which has yet more astonished me was, that when
I thought my self sure and out of danger of all mishaps, a worse then all the
former suddenly chanced unto me, the which (considering the place wherein I
was) I thought verily to have been the end and consumation of my days.
Nevertheless the Lord God regarding me in pity, sent my young son Esplandian
to my sorrowful prison, from whence he has delivered me, as no doubt you
have heard. Now my good subjects you all see me to be very old and white
haired, having already attained to the threescore and tenth year of mine age,
which makes me think it time now to forget all wordly pleasures, and to serve
God to whom I am so much bound: And for this cause I have determined from
henceforth to forsake all royal dignity, and leave you my son Amadis for your
king, to whom at this time I yield both my Crown, Scepter, and all the right
I have unto the government of this land: praying you all as much as possibly I
may, that hereafter you will be faithful and true subjects unto him, as you
have always ben to me. And although he be but my son in law, if I knew him
unworthy of the place, believe me my good friends, I would sooner choose a
mere stranger for my successor, then I would do him: but there is not one
among you but knows well his great deserts, and of what race he comes:
that at this day may well be called one of the most noble and happiest linages
in all the word, as being descended from the valiant Troyans, whereof the
memory shall endure for ever. He is a kings son, heir unto the crown of
France, and now your Prince and Governor, and so I leave him unto you, with my
daughter your Queen and lawful Princess: holding to my self only the castle
of Mirefleur, where (with Gods help) the Queen and I will end our days
religiously, serving God, as we are bound to do. Then calling Amadis, giving
him his royal mantle, he willed him presently to put it on, the like did the
queen to Oriane. Mean time the silence was so great, that nothing could be
heard among the people but cries and lamentations, moved with pity and
compassion to see the determination of their Prince: who being apparrelled in a
simple robe of black cloth, took his son and the Queen his daughter, set
them in their regal seats, and in presence of all the people, set each of them
a crown of gold upon their heads, causing them to be proclaimed by the Heralds,
King and Queen of great Brittaigne: That done, every man departed, some
weeping, and others glad, for the advancement they hoped from the new king, who
from thenceforth began so wisely to govern his country, that never was any
prince better beloved nor obaied of his subjects. King Luisart within short
time after (accompanied of the Queen and Grumedan) went unto Mirefleur as he
had determined to do, where they lived so austerely, helping and being present
at every hour when service was to be said as readily as the poorest of the
old men that remained there, for the administration and service to the
religious women in the monaster of the devout Abbess Adalasta. But when king
Amadis perceived his means to recompense those of whom in his young years
he had received great pleasure and service, he began to exalt Arban de
Norgales, giving him one of the fairest Islands in his country, to Gandales the
lands of the duke of Bristow, to Gandalin (as then absent) he gave the lands
of A^calaus the inchanter, he made Angriotte destrauaulx great master of his
horse, Guilan le pensife high steward of his house, Ardan le nain his chief
caruer, and married the Gentlewoman of Denmark very richly. Not long after the
Queen was brought to bed of a goodly son and a fair daughter both at one
birth, the son named Perion, and the daughter Brisenne: At whose nativity
great joy was made throughout all the country, especially at London, where the
same day one of Norandels Squires arrived, that told king Amadis how
Esplandian and his master met together in Almaigne, where the day before he
had slain two Giants, and delivered Gandalin with diverse other knights,
Squires, Ladies, and Gentlewomen out of prison. Know thou (said the King)
what way they took afterward? My lord (said the Squire) they made account io
go unto the castle called La montaigne defendu, to help them that are
therein, being in great necessity: Which the king understanding, sent
presently for all the Pilotes that might be found, and in all have caused to
rig and arm the greatest ship he had to sail into the East to his son, who
in ye mean time (moved thereunto by Frandalo) departed from the castle of
Matroco with the Emperors army to invade the Turks country, as in the next
chapter you shall hear.

CHAP. XXIX. How the town of Alfarin in Turkey being assaulted, was taken by
Esplandian and the rest of his company.
NOt long after the siege of La montaigne defendu was raised, and Gastilles
arrived at the castle as you heard before: Frandalo had advise by Belleris his
nephewe, (that returned out of Turkey, where he had been to see what news in
the country) that Alforax son to king Armato, and governor of ye great
City of Tasifant, understanding the imprisonment of his father, with the
overthrow of the Turkish army, was departed from the town of Alfarin: where
he had left the beautiful Princess Heliaxa his wife, daughter to Amphirion
king of Medea, to go with all diligence to set order in his own government,
and raise more men, thereby to resist the Christians power if they entered
further into ye country. Which understood by Esplandian, Gastilles, Ambor,
Manely, and the king of Denmark, they determined to enter into Turkey,
whereunto by many reasons Frandalo persuaded them, showing them what means
they had to besiege the town of Alfarin, not above two days journey from them,
being hardly provided of victuals, and no Garrison therein: Wherefore it was
agreed among them, that Gastilles with his Navy of ships should depart the
next evening in as secret manner as he could, to see if he might surprise
their Haven, and that they on the other side would travail all night, whereby
they might besiege the Town both by land and sea, entering therein before the
Turks should hear news thereof. And as they agreed, they put the same in
execution: in such manner that Gastilles (giving forth that he would return
again unto Constantinople) about sun setting took ship, when he put to
sea, the moon shone bright, wherefore hoising up their ankers, they set sail:
And they had not sailed long, but he called his cheef Captains together,
discovering his enterprise unto the^, wherewith presently leaving the way to
Constantinople, they made toward the town of Alfarin. On the other side,
Frandalo slept not, when he perceived his time, (all the company being already
advertised that he meant to go by night) they issued out of the castle, every
man carrying victuals with him for the space of four days: And they travailed
so long, that about the break of day they came unto a great forest, where
they stayed in ambushme^t till the nert night following, when they issued
forth, and about three of the clock at night they came unto a path that went
two ways, where Frandalo caused them to stay, and calling Esplandian, said
unto him: My lord, I pray you let us two and no more take the way that leads
on the left hand, and Belleris my nephew shall guide the rest of our company to
the mountaigne of Yarebreh, from whence they may easily see if our Navy be
near the city of Alfarin: and then as they find the enterprise go forward,
they may assail the place, or else remain in ambush til occasion serves. You
and I will follow on this way, that will bring us to ye aduenturous fountain, by
the which lies the great way that leads to Tesifant, where most commonly are
found diverse strange adventures, and if by fortune we might meet the
Princess Heliaxe, that as to morrow should depart from Alfarin to go unto her
husband, we shall not loose our labors. Let us go (said Esplandian:) with
that Belleris and his company went their way, and Frandalo, Esplandian, Sergil,
with the Gentlewoman of Denmark took the other way, who about ye break of
day arrived at the aduenturous fountain, where there stood four great copper
pillars all gilded, and at each pillar hong a table with certain writings
therein, the contents whereof when time serves you shall hear declared, as
also the occasion why they were set up. Being arrived there, not far off they
perceived a light that issued out of a Taffata pauillion that stood upon the
side of the fountain, whereunto they approached as covertly as they could,
where they perceived a most beautiful Gentlewoman combing of her hair, and not
far from thence twenty knights all armed keeping watch about her, among the
which was a squire holding a horse all trapped with cloth of gold. But Frandalo
and Esplandian were no sooner arrived, but they were discovered, yet they
fearing a greater ambush, the most part of them losing courage, began to fly
away: which the two knights perceiving, entered among them, and at their first
coming overthrew four or five of them unto the ground, forcing them that were
behind to return again, wherewith there began a fierce and cruel battle,
for those that first began to run away (looking back and perceiving only two
knights that set upon their fellows) were so ashamed, that they turned again
to help them: nevertheless without the force of three Giants that held against
the knights, they could not have endured so long against Esplandian and
Frandalo, but they three fought so valiantly with them, that the two knights
were in the greatest danger then ever they were before. And as you see a Boar
foming at the mouth (followed of a troop of dogs) set his tail against a
tree, and with his tuskes tear and rent the flesh of the boldest dogs that do
assail him, so were Frandalo and Esplandian among the knights they had
assailed, striking both on the right hand and the left with so great fury, that
at one instant two of their principal enemies were slain, so that there
remained but one Giant to fight with them, with whom Frandalo made his party
good, while Esplandian followed the rest, that as then began to fly. But when
the Giant perceived Esplandian return, being in fear of death, he stepped
aside and said unto Frandalo, Sir Knight, you and I have often been companions
in many haulty enterprises, I pray you therefore show me the favor to receive
me unto mercy, otherwise you might be blamed of those that know us both, for
I am your cousin Foron. Whereat Frandalo was much abashed, and could hardly be
persuaded thereunto, wherefore he prayed him to put off his helmet, and if it
be true (said he) that thou art Foron, I will use thee both like a friend and
kinsman. Wherewith the Giant disarmed his head, whereby Frandalo knew him and
embraced him, whereat Esplandian was much abashed, not knowing what had passed
between them, with that he went nearer unto them, asking upon what cause that
salutation proceeded. Then Frandalo told what the Giant was, desiring him
likewise to take pity on him: which Esplandian agreed unto, then they three
together went unto the pauillion, at the entry whereof they found the
gentlewoman talking with Carmelle, no more abashed at the overthrow of her men,
then if she had seen them iustle for their pleasures. She was apparrelled in
a gown of Damask all imbrodered and set wih Pearls and precious stones,
Frandalo presently knew her, as having seen her oftentimes, especially the
same day she was married to Alphorax where he iusteled and did so valiantly,
that she entertained him for her knight, wherefore lighting on foot, and
pulling off his helmet, he saluted her in most humble manner. Wherewith she
being abashed to see him that she esteemed wholly to be hers, so to have
behaved himself against her guard, said unto him: How now Frandalo, is this the
service I looked for at your hands, having received you for my knight? The
devil take such servants, seeing you are so fainthearted unto her, that
hitherto has reputed you one of the most courteous knights that ever was girl
with sword: but now I find I am deceived, for I should rather have suspected
any other then you to be a doer in this enterprise, whereby I cannot but be
much abashed. Madame (said Frandalo) since ye time I became your knight, at the
last tourney that I ran, a lord of greater power has entertained me into his
service, whom I will serve during my mortal life, seeing it has pleased him to
show me so great favor, being well assured, that when you know him as I do, you
will esteem me happy, how cowardly or villainous soever you account me now.
What is he (said she) tell me of your faith? it is Jesus Christ (said Frandalo:)
yet will I never fail to do you all the honor and service that I can, as also
now at this time, so my companion be content, for without him I cannot do it.
Frandalo (said Esplandian) you may command me, for I am ready to do what
pleases you: Wherefore delay not to do all the pleasure and service you can
unto this lady if it be your will. Wherewith Frandalo thanked him most heartily,
and said to Heliaxe: Madame, seeing he will have it so, I pray you from
henceforth put all your trust in me, and I will not fail to be careful for
you: Mean time I pray you get upon your palfrey, that I may bring you to a
place where you may see far better tourneyes then any at your wedding:
afterward (if it pleases God to favor us) you shall easily perceive how much
I esteem and have in remembrance the favors you have heretofore showed unto
me, being but a simple knight, and you a great Princes to command far better
then my self: for never was Princess more honored and esteemed among her
own subjects then you shall be of them, to whom I mean to bring you, which
may be an example unto kings and mighty Princes, to whom God has given
power and authority, who being advertised of the honorable and good
intertainment made to you by us, they may be moved hereafter to take pleasure
in intertaining the meaner as well as the greater, considring the mutabilitie of
fortune, as by your self it well appears. Frandalo (said she) you may make
as many excuses and fair promises as you list, yet can you not deny but you
have done me wrong, yet in doing as you say you will, your reputation will
be better to the world, although your faith has failed to our gods: wherefore
let us go where it pleases you. With that she got upon her palfrey, and
Frandalo bareheaded leading her horse, till they came near unto the town,
where they heard a great noise, that made the two knights think, either their
enterprise to be discovered, or that their Soldiers assailed the Town. And
fearing they had been repulsed, began to repent themselves of their long staying
with the Princess, to whom Frandalo in most courteous manner said: Madame, Is
it not your pleasure (mean time that I and my companion go unto the town) to
stay here for us with this Gentlewoman and my cousin Foron? I truly (said
Heliaxa) and I will not depart from hence before I hear of you again. With
that Frandalo and Esplandian ran in great have toward the Town, where they
found their companions fighting with those of Alfarin, among the which were
Talanque, Ambor, the king of Denmark, Gandalin and Lazinde, that had given the
town a hard skirmish on that side, thinking to give them so much to do, that
in the mean time the army by sea might assail the water gate: but they were
too soon discovered, whereby they found great resistance on all sides:
Nevertheless Norandel and Belleris had gotten the Barriers, and repulsed the
enemies unto the pallisadoes. Which Esplandian and Frandalo perceiving, they
lighted on foot, and being covered with their shields, their swords in their
hands, passed through the prease, and with bold courage, went so far, that
they slew great number of the enemies: for the Alfarins to defend their city
issued out of the gates, and the Christians to win it, did most valiantly,
but the place was so narrow, they could not hurt their enemies so much as in
the open field. Whereby it happened, that Frandalo and Esplandian minding
either to win or loose, stepped so far forward, that the Alfarins flying
into the town, and they after, found themselves alone within the same among
their enemies, and that so far, that had it not ben for Frandalo, Esplandian
(that took no care but only to kill and overthrow the enemy) had been enclosed
by them, but he pulled him back. Whereby the two knights perceived the danger
they were in, wherefore by little and little they got unto the steps, that went
upon the wall^ where they sustained many hard assalts without being hurt,
although the enemy ceased not to throw Lances, Stones, Darts, and all other
weapons at them they could find, none of the^ daring come to handle strokes,
for if any advanced himself to show his Prowes, it cost him his life, or else
was thrown down headlong. Mean time Norandel and his company, that had seen
Frandalo and Esplandian shut into the town, sought by all means to scale the
walls, or else to break the gates: but all in vain, for they within defended
it so well with Oil, scalding Water, Logs and Stones, that diverse of them were
overthrown, and ended their lives most miserably. And fighting in that sort, a
knight all armed came from the Haven, crying with a loud voice and said: Be of
good courage my children, be of good courage, defend this quarter well, for our
enemies on the sea side have not as yet found means to set one man on land,
and yet have lost above two hundred of their men. By God (said one of them) I
see not one that stands idle, yet can we not overcome these two knights. Why
so (said the other?) They are (said he) entered in among us, and we have been
these two hours fighting with them, but all in vain, for the yoongest of them
fights so valiantly, that we dare not approach them: And which is more, he
and his companion in despite of us all have gotten those stairs, where they
now defend themselves, and that so well that we can find no means to drive them
thence, although many of our men have been slain by them, and others cruelly
wounded. I am of opinion (said the knight) that we receive the^ unto mercy,
for it may be they are such men, that for to have them again, the enemy will
be glad to give king Armato in exchange, and return again into their
country. Whereunto they all ageed, and therewith the knight that had given them
that counsel, made signs unto Esplandian that they would parley with them,
whereby the assault ceased for a time, and the knight spoke unto them in this
manner, Sir knights, you see it is impossible for you to escape from hence, and
it were great pity that two so valiant knights should die so young now in the
flower of your ages. But this we will do, yield your selves, and we will
save your lives. Sir knight (said Esplandian) If we die at this time, we are
quit for ever after, but so much there wants thereof, and we have so good
hearts and so sure a confidence in Jesus Christ, in whose quarrel we fight,
that we hope he will give us means not only to escape this danger, but to
spoil the Town and lead you prisoners with us: Wherefore take this counsel
for your selves, and yield you unto us before the wrath of God be further
moved against you. When they that stood about them heard those words, both
great and small began to cry with a loud voice, saying: Stay that villain,
let him die, or we will die here at his feet: wherewith they assailed them so
fiercely, that they were constrained to get upon the highest steps. But not
long after they repulsed the enemy so valiantly with stones (whereof they found
great quantity upon the Portall) that from that time forwards they had no
longer stomachs to assail them. But Norandel and the rest being without,
understanding the noise and the voice of their companions, whom they esteemed
dead or taken prisoners, determined to set fire on the gates, while the rest
assailed the town: Wherewith every man ran to fetch wood, which the Alfarins
perceived, but to conclude, they could not shun it, but whether they would or
not, the drawbridge and the gates were set on fire: wherewith they were so
abashed, that most part of them began to fly unto the great temple of Jupiter,
the principal place of strength within their city, the rest staying behind,
with full determination rather to die then suffer the Christians to enter the
Town. And seeing the gates burnt down, so many of them ran to fetch water,
that not long after the Christians had means to assail the town on that
side, which assault continued so long that day failed, yet could they not enter
by reason of the great resistance the Alfarins made, but the two knights that
were above did them so much hurt with blocks and stones, that not any of them
durst appear, whereby the Christians became masters of the town. Wherein
great number of people, both men, women, and children, were put to the sword,
and more had died had it not ben night, specially on the water side where
G^stilles and his army entered with most great fury. Nevertheless fearing least
the Alfarins should assemble again, and in the night they might be repulsed,
he commanded a retraict to be founded, being well assured the next day to
have the town at their pleasure. And for the same cause he sent to the army on
land that they should do the like: wherewith every man retired, setting watch
in those places where most need required. The town in this sort being
conquered, and the people gotten into the great temple of Jupiter, Esplandian
minding not to lose the Princess Heliaxe, nor the Giant Foron, that he and
Frandalo left with Carmelle, desired Gandalin and Lazinde to go fetch them,
and with them he sent Sergil his Squire to bring them to the place: which they
presently did, and made such have, that they found her sitting by a great fire
that Foron had made, where lighting off their horses and saluting Heliaxe,
Gandalin said: Madame, my lord Esplandian prays you to come unto the place
where he staieth for you. My friends (said she) I knew him not, true it is I
was brought hither by two knights, whereof one is Frandalo, that I have known
long time, but for the other I assure you as far as I remember I never saw
him before. Madame (said Carmelle) he is son to the valiant knight Amadis
de Gaul, whose fame is spread so far about the world. Truly (said Heliaxa)
I have heard of him, so have you (as I think said Carmelle) of my lord
Esplandian his son: for he alone conquered the castle La montaigne defendu,
and now lately has taken king Armato your father in law, and I can assure you
he is one of the courteous knights living in the world. I am much abashed then
(said she) how he showed himself so discourteous in my behalf, not speaking
unto me while I was in his company, yet me thinks being his prisoner, he
could have done no less then comfort me, either with good speeches or fair
promises, whereof he has used so few, that while I live I shall never think
well of him. Madame (said Carmelle) you take the matter otherwise then it is,
for if he refrained to speak unto you, it was by reason of the great
acquaintance he perceived Frandalo to have with you, unto whom he is so great
a friend, that he was not only content to give him leave to entertain you,
but much greater favor would he do unto him if he can. You may say what you
will (said she:) Nevertheless, if he have no other excuse then that you
allege in his behalf, he shall never lose the disliking he has gotten at
my hands. Madame (said Gandalin) I am well assured he will amend that fault
when it pleases you, wherefore I pray you determine what you mean to d^e, for
he has commanded us to do as pleases you: My friends (said Heliaxe) I
would gladly sleep till it be day, then I will be ready to go where you
think good, but I pray you tell me what noise it was I heard of late within
the Town. Madame (said Lazinde) It is not yet three hours since the Town
was taken by assault. Good God (said she) what miserable fortune was that for
the poor inhabitants, I think they are all put unto the sword. No madame
(said Lazinde) the greater part have saved themselves in the great Temple of
Jupiter, but they will hardly escape when it is day, for our Generals are
determined to burn the Temple. If it be so (said she) that Frandalo has
any credit with his companions, and that he that sent you be so courteous as
this Gentlewoman reports him to be, I hope they will take pity on the
poor people: at least, if not for the love of them, I trust upon request for
my sake they will not refuse it. And to the end I come not thither for late, I
pray you when day appears, let us presently depart, wherewith laying her
down upon a cloak, she passed the rest of the night, not greatly to her ease.

CHAP. XXX. How Gandalin and Lazinde brought the Princess Heliaxe and the
Giant Foron into the Town of Alfarin to Esplandian and Frandalo, and of the
honorable intertainment they had.
HEliaxe that had not slept all that night, being grieved for the loss of the
town of Alfarin, the ordinary abiding place of Alphorax her husband, and
withal the pleasantest and most delicious place of all Turkey, perceauing day
to appear, waked the two knights, making her account if she might get into
the town before the destruction of the temple, the people that were fled into
it, (by her request and humble supplication to Esplandian and Frandalo) should
be saved. With that they all mounted on their horses, and made such have, that
they entered into the town, as the Christians began to assault the fortress,
and when Frandalo perceived the Princess Heliaxe, he rode unto her, bidding
her God morrow, and taking her palfry by the bridle bareheaded, brought her to
Esplandian and his company that did her great honor, knowing her to be a kings
daughter, and wife to so great a Prince. With that she asked Frandalo which of
them was Esplandian, Madame (said he, pointing unto him) here he is ready to
do you any service that he can, as he has assured me. But when she
perceived him to be so young and of so great beauty, she was abashed to
think how nature had furnished him with so many good perfections, especially of
so great and incomparable force, whereof he had the commendation among the most
valerous knights: wherewith she said unto Frandalo, In good faith I have
heard him commended in diverse places for one of the best knights living in the
world, and of mine own knowledge I have seen him do that which I would never
have thought to be in him, considering his young years, so that if he abound
as much in courtesy as he does in valor and beauty, I think him to be the
brauest Gentleman that may be found: which I shall presently see if he grant
me one request. Madame (said Esplandian, blushing at the praises she used in
respect of him) If I do it not, you shall be the first that ever I refused
gift unto in all my life: and considering your great beauty and most courteous
behavior, how should it be possible for me to disobay your will? I pray you
then sir knight (said she) to pardon the poor people that are within the
Temple, and grant them unto me, with leave to send them where I shall think
good, not hurting them any more. In good truth madame (said Esplandian) you
shall not be refused for so small a matter, and I will do so much with the
other knights, that they shall give consent, as also to your own liberty and
the Giant Forons, to guide you where it pleases you, which Frandalo did most
earnestly desire at our hands before you arrived here: And for his sake look
what else you will command at our hands, we are ready to perform it with all
our hearts. For the which the Princess Heliaxe thanked him most heartely, and
turning to Frandalo, said unto him: Sir Knight, the good that you and your
companions do unto me, shall never be forgotten on my part, but I will by
all means seek to acknowledge the same, although presently I cannot do it:
wherefore if it pleases you, cause your soldiers to retire, that these poor
distressed people may come forth according to your promise: In the mean time I
will go comfort them, for I am in doubt most part of them are rather dead then
living: with that she desired Carmelle to bear her company, they two going to
the Temple gate, which they found fast shut and rampired up: then she called
so loud, that some of them spoke unto her: but never did men by pardon from
their Prince, brought back again from the Gibbet, more rejoice, nor were
better comforted then they when they knew her, thinking the prince Alphorax had
made some agreement with their enemies. Wherefore they opened a little wicket,
whereat she and the Gentlewoman entered into the Temple, they asking the
Princess how it was her chance to come thither in so good a time to succor
them, that looked for no other favor then most cruel death. My friends (said
she) I have done so much with the Christians (by Frandalos means) whom I have
known long time, that they are content to let you issue forth, your lives
saved, and go where it pleases you, and my self likewise that had fallen
into their hands as well as you: wherefore choose whether you will follow me to
Tesifant where my lord Alphorax is, who for my sake will show you all the favor
and courtesy he may. When the poor people understood the agreement made for
them by the Princess Heliaxe, they all agreed to go with her, and not forsake
her, giving her most hearty thanks for the good she had wrought them. Then
(said Heliaxe) let those that have armor put it off, and come all forth with
me. Then she being accompanied in that manner, came unto Esplandian, and
showing him great numbers of women and little children that stood about her,
said unto him: I pray you sir knight behold the good whereof you are the cause,
and think what damage it had been if these poor s^lly souls had suffered
death for no offense, wherein you are worthy great commendations. And yet (said
she, smiling) while I live, I shall not forget the small account you made of
me when Frandalo and you found me before my pauillion, after the overthrow of
my knights. Wherefore madame (said Esplandian?) I marvel (said she) why
you ask me such a question, seeing you might well conceive what grief I had
in mind, yet did you not so much as once salute me, or use word unto me: in
good truth it was but discourteously done of you. Madame (said he) I beseech
you pardon me, for the fault I committed in your behalf, was not done for
want of bringing up, but fearing to breed some jealousy in Frandalos mind,
seeing him so much affected to do you service, together with the good
countenance you showed unto him, although you had lost your men. This excuse
(said Heliaxe) is not to be accepted, neither shall you escape so easily
therewith: which she spoke with so good a countenance, that her seeming to be
offended, contented all the company: wherefore Esplandian said unto her,
Madame, I am content to make amends for this great fault, or to do what
penance it pleases you. The penance (said she) that you shall have shall be,
that according to the promise of mercy you have made unto these poor people,
as also of favor in mine own behalf, you give us leave to go unto the city
of Tesifant to my husband, that for the same we think the better of you.
Madame (said Esplandian) you have already understood our minds, wherefore you
may freely go whether it pleases you, and I my self will be your guide if it
be your pleasure. With that Heliaxe gave them many thanks, and taking her
leave, got upon her palfrey, and being accompanied of Foron with a great number
of the poor people, took the way that went to Tesifant, Frandalo going with
her above a league and more, and further would have gone although he were
wounded in diverse places of his body, but she desired him to go back again.
For (said she) although like a good and courteous knight you have had ye means
not only to serve me, but also to save the life of me and mine, it may be I
shall not have so the like to do the same for you if you fall into my lord
Alphorax hands: who as I think ere now is advertised of my misfortune, whereby
I am in doubt he is already in the field with great number of men to succor
me. And if it should be so, I know him so impatient, that if he meet with you
(being already moved with the loss of Alfarin, as also the injury my knights
have received, and my self likewise as he will suppose) the pleasure that you
do me would breed a danger to your person, and to me great grief, wherefore I
pray you go no further, but turn back again. Frandalo knew her counsel to
be good, wherewith he committed her to God: leaving her in the guard of his
cousin Foron, and therewith returned the same way that he came. It was then
somewhat late, wherefore Heliaxe having travailed unto the aduenturous fountain,
and finding her pauillion as yet standing up, determined not to depart from
thence till the next day in the morning, that she took the way that led to
Tesifant. And having ridden till noone, she met the Prince Alphorax, with a
great number of knights that all night had stayed upon the way to the castle La
montaigne defendu, thinking those that had taken his wife would lead her
thither, to have her in safe keeping, and such was their opinion that brought
him news thereof. But they met not any man in the way, wherefore they returned
again to go unto the aduenturous fountain, much grieved when they perceived
the Princess Heliaxe coming toward them, to whom Alphorax ran, and
imbrasing him with a loving kiss, asked her how she had escaped from the
enemy. My lord (said she) when I shall have told you how, yet am I in doubt you
will hardly believe it. And to say the truth, it seems fortune has taken
pleasure in one day to make me know both the good and evil she could do
unto me. Then she showed him of the overthrow of her knights, the words that
passed between Frandalo, Esplandian, and her: and lastly the honest
intertainement they used in her behalf. Truly madame (said Alphorax) it is
very strange, and I cannot imagine how these Christian dogs (having taken my
Town of Alfarin by assault) have used so much humanity, not only to these
people, but have saved your honor, being such and so beautiful a lady as you
are. But it is to be thought, that our gods having compassion on me, have
preserved you, as the thing I love and most esteem off in this world. Yet if I
live but one year longer, I swear and promise unto you to assemble so many
men together, that the city of Constantinople and her perjured Emperor shall
suffer and endure much woe: in such manner, that the memory thereof shall not be
extinct for one thousand years after my decease. Heliaxe that perceived him
enter into choler, to pacefie the same, answered vim and said: My lord, you may
do it when it pleases you, but at this present you see here a great number of
poor desolate people, I beseech you speak unto them and comfort them as well
as you may, for their whole trust is in you, with that Alphorax going unto
them, gave them many gracious and comfortable speeches, and with them returned
to the city of Tesifant.

CHAP. XXXI. How Gastilles took his leave of Esplandian, and sailed to
Constantinople, and of the arrival of Palomir, Branfil, and other knights of
great Brittaigne at the town of Alfarin.
THe Town of Alfarin brought under the subjection of the knights of the castle
La montaigne defendu, as you heard before, Gastilles having prepared himself
to return to Constantinople, went unto Esplandian, and said unto him: My lord,
when I departed from the Emperor, he gave me express commandment with all
speed to advertise him what I had done, to the end he might determine either to
come himself in person, if occasion served, with the army he is already
preparing, or else wholly to break off his enterprise, for it now begins to
be Winter, and seeing (as it is Gods will) that your affairs on this side are
in good estate, I am determined as to morrow to depart hence to Constantinople,
that the Emperor understanding by me what has passed on this side the sea,
he shall not be forced for this year to be at further charges, whereof before
this time I had willingly certefieed him, had it not ben the daily expectation
I had to see ye end of this our last enterprise, which God be thanked is
fallen out as we desired. My lord (said Esplandian) seeing the Emperor (as
you say) by your return may receive both, pleasure and profit, you shall do
well to make have thither: one thing I beseech you do for me, that is, most
humbly to commend me unto his grace, assuring him, that not any subject he
has, is or shall be readier to obey him then my self: and as touching our
proceedings, for that you have personally both seen and been an actor in the
same, you can advertise him at large. Show him likewise I pray you that I keep
king Armato as his prisoner, attending his pleasure what shall be done with
him, but not the castle of La montaigne defendu, for I have conquered the same
in favor and under the protection of the Princess Leonorine, keeping the same
at this present only to her use and as her servant, as I mean to continue
during my life. But if it pleases his grace to give the Town of Alfarin to
Frandalo, not only thereby to increase his will and desire to serve him, but
also for that he deserves a greater reward: so doing, me thinks he shall
therein show the part of a liberal Prince, considering the service and
fidelity he has done and showed in all places where he has been employed:
You shall tell the Emperor also, that according to my fathers will and
commandment, I hope shortly to be in Constantinople to present my self
before his grace and the lady Leonorine, as by the Gentlewoman Carmelle I have
given the^ to understand, wherewith I think you are not unacquainted, praying
you in the mean time, to make my excuse to them, in that I have deferred it
off so long; for in a manner, you are not ignorant what has been the cause.
My lord (said Gastilles) the Emperor my uncle so much desires your company,
that I never saw man more grieved, nor woman than the Princess my cousin, when
they perceived the great serpent pass before Constantinople, to cross the
straightes of Bosphore. I will show them what you say, and in the morning
about break of day, I mean, God willing, to set sail. Will you not (said
Esplandian) first go visit Frandalo, Manely, and others, that lie wdunded in
their beds, to know if they will send any message to the Empeperour? That I
will (said Gastilles.) Go then (said Esplandian) and I will bear you
company. With that they went to Frandalos lodging, where they were no sooner
entered, but the watch that stood upon the tower over the water gate, discovered
about three miles in the sea, a great ship that with full sail made toward
the town: whereof they advertised Gastilles, who presently caused two
Brigandines to go forth to see if they were friends or enemies: and they were
not long before they returned again with the great ship in their company,
wherein were Palomir, Branfil, Helian le delibere, Garuate du Val Craintif,
Brauor son of the giant Balan that king Amadis had newly made knight, Imosel
de Burgoigne, Ledarin de Faiarque, Listoran de la tour Blanch, Trion cousin to
queen Briolanie, Tentilles le Superbe, Guil le bien esteem Grodonan brother to
Angriote Destrauaux, and the two sons of Isamie governor of the firm Isle,
with many others that had embarked themselves in great Britain to go to aid
Esplandian: and coming to the castle La montaigne defendu, they had
intelligence by the fishermen at sea, of the overthrow of Armatos navy, his
captivity, with the taking of the city of Alfarin, whereat they much
rejoiced, especially when they knew by Gastilles soldiers that not any of
their companions were slain in the assault. They being arrived at the town,
as they began to land, Esplandian with diverse others went thither to receive
them: where between them were many salutations and welcomes given: which done,
Esplandian led them to his lodging, where they refreshed themselves about two
hours, before they went to visit Frandalo, of whom Esplandian gave such
commendations, that they desired him to bring them where he lay, which he
presently did: but when Frandalo knew who they were (being ashamed to see them
use such courtesy to him) could not well tell what to say: and as he
entertained them, Palomir spoke unto him and said: Sir knight, I and my
company have heard so great commendation of your valor, that there is not one
of us but would be ready to obey and serve you as our chief commander:
wherefore, we beseech you, use all diligence you may to be healed of your
wounds, that we may presently go into the field under your conduction. My lords
(said Frandalo) I pray you pardon me, I am well assured that my valor is none
such as you report, whereby I deserve not the praise you give me, neither did I
ever any thing worthy commendation, but only by my lord Esplandians means.
Nevertheless I hope, if God spares me life and health, so to behave my self,
that all men shall know the desire I have to do service unto Christendom, and
particularly unto every one of you. Companion (said Esplandian) I pray you take
care to be cured of your grief: that done, we will take order for the rest:
and for that these knights are weary with their long travail on the sea, I
pray you give them leave for to depart, and in the morning we will visit you
again. Which he said, fearing least too much talk might cause him fall into a
fever, for Gastilles before that had been devising with him above two hours
together, touching the conference between him and Esplandian as concerning his
return unto the Emperor. With that the knights bad him farewell, and went out
of the chamber: on the other side Gastilles made all the have he could to
depart from thence the next day in the morning, and taking leave of all his
friends, the same night he entered into his ship: and when day began to appear,
he set sail with so good wind, that within eight days he discovered ye city
of Constantinople, entering into the haven: which ye Emperor understanding, went
to receive him, and going with him to the palace, asked him what he had done in
his viage, and whether Armato were retired from the siege or not. My lord
(said he,) The good knight Esplandian and his company most humbly commend
themselves unto your grace, especially Frandalo, whom I can assure you to be
one of the best servant that ever you had. With that the Empress accompanied
with the Princess Leonorine, Queen Minoresse, and diverse other ladies and
Gentlewoman came thither, to whom Gastilles doing humble reverence, they bad
him welcome, and because he stayed to do Esplandians commendations to the
Princess Leonorine, the Emperor said unto him: Truly nephew, you shall make
an end, to show us what has happened in your voyage, then if it please you
you may court the ladies. Wherefore I pray you tell from the beginning what you
have done. My lord (said he) at our departure from hence we had so good a
wind, that without any let we arrived at the castle La montaigne defendu, yet
could we not make such have, but that Esplandian with his great Serpent, and
Frandalos ships had already drowned and overthrown certain of the enemies
ships, and made the rest to fly, and the next day after king Armato was taken
prisoner, his army overthrown and put to flight: but the sport was when I
saluted the Turk, and that he knew me, then he told the great rage the
Turk was in, the threatenings and speeches he used unto him, the overthrow of
the twenty knights at the aduenturous fountain, the skirmishes and assaults at
the Town of Alfarin, the danger wherein Esplandian and Frandalo found
themselves, the taking of the Town and of Heliaxe, her delivery with the
peoples that fled to the temple of Jupiter, and how that before he embarked
himself to return, a great ship arrived there from great Brittaigne with
diverse knights therein, whose names and sirnames he rehearsed, as having seen
them with king Amadis. Further my lord (said he) the good knight Esplandian
willed me to show you that he keeps king Armato till your grace shall
dispose of him, as also the city of Alfarin, but for the castle La montaigne
defendu, he says he minds not to yield the same to any other then to the
Princess Leonorine, in whose name he has conquered it, hoping as her
servant and no other to defend the same. When will he be here (said the
Emperor?) With all the speed he may (said Gastilles) as he has promised
me. In good faith (said the Emperor) I would it were this day before
tomorrow, I have so great desire to know him by reason of the great chiualry
that daily increases in him, in such manner, that if heretofore the knight
with the Green Sword has been esteemed the best in all the world, now his
son diminishes a great part of his glory. And all being well considered, I
think that Amadis has not done more in ten years time, then Esplandian
has accomplished in the space of ten weeks: But touching Frandalo, is he
so well disposed to our service as you make report? My lord (said Gastilles,)
It is not possible to do better then he has done: wherefore, my lord
Esplandian willed me to show you, that for the better entertaining him in his
proceedings, he is of advise that your grace should give him the city of
Alfarin, not knowing any man worthier then he to keep it. In good truth
(said the Emperor) Esplandian and his companions have had the pains to
conquer it, wherefore I am content they have the disposing thereof:
Nevertheless, if they rest upon my consent therein, I am well content it shall
be so, and I will not cease to show him greater favor, if he persevere as
he has begun. And you daughter (said he to the Princess Leonorine) what
say you to this that my cousin Gast^lles has told you touching Esplandian,
that says he keeps the castle La montaigne defendu for you only? My lord
(said she) I know not how you and many others esteem so much of him,
considering the small obedience he shows to his father, for if he were such
a knight as he is reported, he had long since come hither to acquit the
promise whereunto he is bound: which makes me verily think, the speech
Carmelle used of him, and all that he has sent you by word of mouth by my
cousin Gastilles, are only but dissimulations. And I for my part am not yet
determined (although he reports himself to be my knight) to accept him for
the same, much less to pardon him before he comes in person to excuse his
fault, then I will consider what I have to do. The emperor that perceived his
daughter speak with such a choler, and therewith to blush more then ordinary,
could not refrain laughter, and said unto her. What daughter, do you refuse
the service of the best knight in all the world? I my lord (said she) and so
should every master his servant, when he flies from his presence, and
obeys not his commandments no more then he has done both yours and mine.
Truly sweet heart (said the Emperor) I like you well, I would to God that
nature had furnished you with a body like unto your heart, if she had, she
had made you a perfect man, and not a woman as you are. Now nephewe you hear
my daughters answer, I pray you let Esplandian know it, that he may make have
hither, least he lose not her good will. And although the Emperor spoke it as
in jest, Esplandian took it otherwise when he heard the news by a squire that
Gastilles sent unto him.

CHAP. XXXII. How Frandalo accompanied of fourscore Knights, issued out of
Alfarin toward Tesifant, and of the taking of Eiraca captain of the Town.
THe knights of great Brittaigne arrived in the Town of Alfarin, (as you heard
before) Frandalo and others that were hurt being healed of their wounds,
Belleris that ceased not continually to hearken after Alphorax, was advertised
by his spies, that he continued in the city of Tesifannt, which he and
Branfil told unto the rest of their company, who therewith being somewhat
encouraged, very earnestly desired Frandalo to lead the^ forth, and bring them
to some place where they might lie in ambush to surprise Alphorax or some of
his company if they chanced to stray abroad. Frandalo not willing to deny
them any reasonable request, agreed (with the consent of Esplandian) to depart
the next night following, and to take with the^ to the number of fourscore
knights and no more, which Esplandian liked well, he minding to be one. Where
upon those that were appointed for the journey prepared themselves, and about
sun setting issued out of Alfarin, Frandalo and Belleris knowing ye country
so well, that they needed no other guides, but travailed strait toward
Tesifant, and having ridden till eleven of the clock at night, they came unto
a cross way, where Frandalo advised them to divide themselves in two
companies, willing the knights (that before that time had never ben in Turkey)
to hold close together. For (said he) the wars in these countries are far
otherwise then they are in great Brittaigne, where knights use most commonly to
travail alone without company, and although they chance sometimes to ride in
companies, the least occasion that happens makes them separate themselves,
but here those that use arms travail in great companies together, whereby the
combats that are fought here most commonly are rather battles then
incounters. And more then this, if three hundred Turks chance to surprise one
hundred, thirty, twenty, or less number of their enemies, they take a pride
to put them to death, preferring revenge before a certain kind of honor, that
(as I have understood) is kept and observed in the West parts, where combats
are in a manner equal. Wherefore my friends (said he) I pray you separate not
your selves, but march all in a company, assuring you that in the place whether
we go, we shall not fail to find men sufficient against whom we may
employ our forces, and show what valor is in us. I know that within half a
mile of Tesifant Alphorax uses oftentimes to lie at a house that he has
caused to be made called Gruobinach, where if it be our good fortunes we may
chance to find him, wherefore I am of advise that we divide our selves in two
companies, my nephew Belleris shall take the left hand, and lie in ambush near
unto the village of Ientinomele, from whence he may easily perceive when any
man issues out of Tesifant, and I with Esplandian and the other half of our
company will follow this way that brings us unto a valley near to
Gruobinach, where we will secretly stay if need require, to succor each other:
whereunto they all agreed: but before they departed thence, they found their
enterprise to be far more dangerous than they esteemed it, as hereafter you
shall hear. Belleris and his company leaving Frandalo, travailed so long,
that about two hours before day they met fix soldiers, whom Belleris
saluted in the Arabian language, asking them of what place they were. My Lord,
said they, we are going to the town of Srasse. My good friends (said he) we
travail this night to Tesifante to advertise ye prince Alphorax of the great
dommage and destruction the Christian dogs continually do and within short
spade have done unto ye country round about: for they are issued out of
Alfarin, and have taken and carried away all they can find: and as yet are
abroad, not ceasing to execute all tyranny they can devise: nevertheless, if it
pleases him to give us aid, we know the place of their retrait, where we may
easily enclose them, and not one of them shall escape. What are you, said the
soldiers, that bring us these news? Friends (said Belleris) I am Roussan,
cousin to Eiraca, ehiefe captain of Tesifant. We can tell you good news of
him, said the soldiers, wherewith we think you will be well pleased: for he
is not far from hence, being ridden out of Tesifant with two hundred knights
to go unto Falandie, to see the same be not so lightly surprised as Alfarin
was. But because he willed us to ride before, we will stay no longer:
wherewith they had them farewell. Friends (said Belleris) the good fortune I
wish you I pray God may happen unto you. With that the soldiers passed on
their way, but they had not gone far when Belleris sent after them, and
fearing they would discover his enterprise, caused them to be slain: and
therewith presently dispatched one of his Squires on message to Frandalo, to
advertise him of the enemies being abroad with a very strong and huge
company: whereupon he wished him to join with them. The Squire made all the
have he could, but before the news came to Frandalo, Belleris met with Eiraca
and his company about the village of Ientinomele, being upon them before they
had time to put on their helmets. There did the captain of Tesifant show
himself to be no young beginner in arms, for that like a valiant and hardy
knight he entered among the Christians, and being seconded by his men, did
most valiantly defend themselves, and assailed the enemy, although at their
first encounter ten of their brauest soldiers were unhorsed and overthrown.
And as Eiraca entered into the prease, Norandel and he met together with such
force, that Norandel was wounded in the left shoulder, but not sore hurt, and
the captain of Tesifant loosing his stirrops, was thrown over his horse with
so great a strength, that with the fall he was forced to lie upon the ground,
and could remove neither hand nor foot, which the Turks perceauing, to
relieve their captain, did so valiantly, that they overthrew four of the
British knights, who nevertheless rose presently again, and with their
swords in hand, thrust so many of the Turks horses into the sides and
flanckes, that in short space more then twenty of the Turks were overthrown
likewise, and many slain outright: at that charge Enil and Gauarte were hurt,
and the rest so hardly handeled, that without Frandalos company that came to
succor them, they had all been ourthrowne: and in truth they had almost
straied too long, but the Squire that Belleris sent unto them, could not
overtake them before they were in the valey where they should have met. And
although they had heard the sound of their blows, yet did they not suspect any
such perrill, until the squire had done his message, wherewith they ran with
all the speed they could unto the place, where Belleris and his companions
(being out of breath) did nothing but recule, and defend themselves against
their enemies blows, that had slain diverse of them, but that the captain of
Tesifant would have them to be taken and presented to the Prince Alphorax:
Nevertheless Frandalo, Esplandian, and the rest of their company, made them
change opinion: for when they perceived their companions so hardly matched by
the enemy, they entered among them with such fury, that had it not been for
Eiraca (who at that time behaved himself most valiantly) they had ouerthrown
ye Turks at their first onset, but by reason of the great resistance he made,
they continued fighting half an hour after, wherein he maintained himself
so well, that Esplandian could never take him before he had overthrown him,
and pulled off his helmet, wherewith he yielded: mean time Frandalo and his
companions being in the middle of the enemies, laid so well about them,
slaying horses, pulling away shields, and doing so valiantly, that wonder it
was to behold them, yet did not the Turks once seem abashed, but still fought
most courageously, until such time they perceived their captain taken
prisoner, which caused them to fly and turn their backs: but not all of
them, for there lay more than one hundred and fifty of them dead upon the
ground, the rest saved themselves by means of the dark night. It was then
about an hour before day: and Frandalo fearing that those of Tesifant (hearing
of the overthrow) would issue forth to cut off their passage, presently caused
captain Eiraca to be remounted, and all the Christians that wanted horses, and
with all speed rode back again to Alfarin, not the same way they came, but
another way somewhat farther about; wherein they travailed so long, that about
sun rising they entered into a great wood, where they alighted to refresh
both themselves and their horses: and staying not long there least they should
be surprised, they made such speed, that about sun setting they arrived in
ye town: mean time news came to Tesifant of the overthrow of their men,
wherewith Alphorax was in such a rage, that in a manner he seemed desperate.
But for this time we have sufficiently discoursed of martial affairs, now
we mean to bring Love in place, who desiring to minister some comfort to the
Princes Leonorine that lived in great pain, expecting the arrival of her
friend Esplandian, caused him to depart from Alfarin to visit her in the city
of Constantinople, as in the Chapters following you shall hear.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of the great grief Esplandian had, understanding by the
messenger that Gastilles sent unto him, what displeasure the Princess
Leonorine had conceived against him.
YOU heard before how Gastilles showed the Emperor what Esplandian had done,
and what message he sent unto him, and to the Princess Leonorine, as also
what answer she made, which Gastilles by his Squire writ and sent unto him,
having charge from the Emperor so to do, thereby to procure his speedier
arrival in Constantinople. The Squire with his lether made such have, that he
arrived at Alfarin about five days after the taking of Eiraca, and meeting
Carmelle at the gate, asked her if he might find Esplandian at convenient
leisour to deliver him a letter from Gastilles, but Carmelle being subtle,
suspecting it to be some news from the Prince^^e Leonorine, that might move
Esplandian, who as then seemed discontent, answered him and said: My good
friend, you can hardly speak with him at this time, but follow me and give me
the letter, and I will present it unto him, and cause him to return you an
answer. The Squire did as she willed him, and followed her to Esplandians
lodging: where entering into his chamber, she found him sitting upon his bed
talking with the king of Denmark, and delivered him Gastilles letter, which
when he read, the tears ran out of his eyes, and therewith cast forth a
great sigh, saying: O Lord? but Carmelle that beheld him, doubting the cause to
be as she suspected, asked him if he were ill at ease. Ill? said he, I that I
am, and so ill that I would to God I were dead: and look I pray you, said he,
whether I have cause or not: wherewith stretching forth hish hand, he gave
Carmelle the letter, and turning his face, began to make the greatest sorrow in
the world: but when she had read the contents, she esteemed not thereof, but
said unto Esplandian: What my Lord? are you abashed at so small a matter? By my
soul I now perceive very well, that the affections and loves of men are far
different and much unlike the passions that we simple women endure, when we
fall into the like extremities: and know you how? you men do most commonly
take pleasure to manifest and make known your love either by word of mouth or
outward shows, and many times dissemble more than you mean to do: and which
is worse, how much the more the Lady or Gentlewoman you love is of great
desert, or high lineage, so much more glory do you take to make it known, not
only that you bear her affection, but that you are beloved and favored of
her above all others: which is clean contrary to the nature of women (I mean
such as may be termed wise and of good understanding) for how much the
greater their parentage is, so much more fear they have to manifest their
amorous passions, in such manner, that most commonly both in word, gesture, and
countenance, they outwardly deny that which they have most deeply engraued in
their hearts and minds: and not without good cause, for that the thing which
redoundeth to your praise and commendations (as you think, which is the
manifesting of your love) breeds to them a certain spot in their honor,
which often times they can not easily deface. Wherefore it is more than
expedient, to observe this modesty and constancy in us, not that I mean to
restrain my self unto this law, seeing that all my glory and felicity
depends upon you, in such manner, that I desire no greater happiness in this
world, then that the love and dutiful obedience I bear unto you, should be
published and made known unto the world, to the end that all those that shall
hear of your great valor and my mean estate, may know my great good fortune,
to have the means to serve you as I do. Wherefore my Lord, in my opinion you
ought to take the speeches Gastilles has written unto you, to be used by the
lady Leonorine in good part and greatly to your advantage, for I dare warrant
you on mine honor, that your affections are both alike: and to say the truth,
she has behaved her self most wisely to dissemble the matter so well as she
has done in the Emperors presence. I deny not but she has some cause to be
impatient, considering the message I delivered unto her in your behalf, but
that is easy to be cured: and although the love she has borne you so long
time should be wholly extinguished (which I can hardly believe) even as a bone
that is broken in two pieces and set together again, is stronger in that place
than in any other part, so you being there and in her company, shall win
that you find broken, and by that means make it stronger than ever it was
before. Therefore I am of advise (that fulfilling her desire) you go unto her,
and that as soon as possibly you may. Alas Carmelle (said Esplandian) what
good or what service did I ever do unto her, thereby to have deserved at her
hands the least favor among an infinite number I have received from her?
specially by the report of your own mouth. If therefore she has just
occasion to be offended with me, having offended her so much, can I hope for
any other at her hands than mere disdain and mortal hatred? My lord (said
Carmelle) I am a woman and know the nature of women better than you do, or
then all the men in the world besides, I pray you therefore believe me, and go
and see her, and if so be she entertain you not according to your desire,
then never give credit to my words again. In faith my good companion (said the
king of Denmark) Carmelle gives you so good and wise counsel, that either you
ought to give credit to her speech, or else wholly drive this fantasy out of
your mind, considering (as is most true) that sometimes, and very often, how
much the more fervent and extreme the love of a woman is, so much the sooner is
it dead and wholly extinguished, for that their inconstancy is such and so
great, that for the least occasion in the world they are over ready to love,
and much more inconsiderately do they forget the same again: not that I
accuse the Princes Leonorine of so great lightness, but to say the truth as
commonly we find, and for my part I know not upon what occasion you ground your
love, whereby you should make so much account of her, seeing yt she never saw
you, nor you her, but are only content to conceive well of each other upon a
certain renowm yt has spread abroad, and set forth the great perfections yt
are reported to be in you both: which in truth may be compared to a fire made
of straw, yt is no sooner kindled but presently consumed: wherefore be not then
so much abashed if ye princes Leonorine show her self at this present so
smally affected toward you, for those yt love most deerly do oftentimes fall
into discurtesies and coldness of affection, that they disdain, or (at the
least) in the twinkling of an eye, wholly forget those that for a long time
they have loved most entirely, and that for their sakes shall have hazarded
their lives in most dangerous adventures. Did you never hear how Brisarde
behaved her self in regard of Troilus, after the destruction of Troy, she
loved him so well that she would needs die in his arms: when she was
constrained to forsake him, the Greeks thinking verily she would have slain
her self: and yet was she scarce issued out of Troy but she wholly forgot her
love Troilus, and transported that vehement love she had borne him all her
life, to Diomedes king of Thrace. O God? What inconstancy? what lightness? what
foundation upon a sandy ground was that? This unconstant woman among other
precious ornaments given her by Troilus her friend, had a pair of perfumed
gloves, which within one hour after her captivity she gave unto her new
friend Diomedes in token of the love and amity she bare unto him. What had
Troilus said then if he had been present? would he have believed her? I think
not. And what a point of honesty, I pray you, did Clitemnestra show unto her
husband, when in steed of welcoming him home at his coming from the siege of
Troy, where he had remained ten years together? she caused him cruelly to be
murdered by Egistus her ruffian. But will you hear more examples of the like
matter? and as he began to proceed, Esplandian said unto him, My good friend, I
pray you do not this wrong unto my lady Leonorine, but let me here your
counsel how I may from henceforth govern my self to satisfy her desire. Go
and see her, said ye king, and if you think good I will bear you company.
Shall we go and leave our companions? (said Esplandian) yt will I never do:
wherefore? said ye king: are not Frandalo, Manely, and the rest of their company
strong enough to defend ye town in your absence? I am of advise yt you send
presently for the^, and give them to understand yt by reason of certain news
you have of late received, you must be constrained to leave them for the space
of eight or fifteen days: and in like sort dispatch Gastilles Squire, and
write unto his master, that you thank him heartily for the good remembrance he
has had of you, and that with all speed you will send a messenger expressly
unto the Emperor with an answer to that it has pleased him to command to be
written unto you: in the mean time, I will take order to prepare a ship to
bring us to the castle La montaigne defendu, where we will imbarke our selves
in the great Serpent, that will not fail (as I think) to bring us unto
Constantinople, and determine with your self what company you mean to take
with you. My good friend (said Esplandian) do as you think good, I am content
to hazard my life in your hands. It suffiseth (said the king) but I pray you
speak unto our companions, and dispatch the squire. With that Esplandian
called for ink and paper, and wrote unto Gastilles as the king of Denmark had
advised him. Next day in the morning Frandalo and the rest of the company came
into his chamber as they used ordinarily to do, and being together devising of
diverse things, Esplandian said unto them: My good friends, I am constrained to
leave your company for the space of fifteen days or three weeks, to go
about certain urgent affairs yt import me much: I will take with me my brother
the king of Denmark, Gandalin, Enil, Carmelle, and no more. I pray you think
it not strange, for if I were not constrained thereunto, I swear unto you of
my faith, I would not do it. There was not any among them that once would ask
him whether he went, but answering him, said: That he might go whither it
pleased him, and that they for their parts would keep ye place till he came
again, although he staid a whole year before he returned; by this means
Esplandian by little and little framed himself to take his voyage while ye
king of Denmark caused the ship that brought the knights of great Britain
thither, to be made ready, and upon a monday in the morning Esplandian and his
company embarked themselves to sail unto the castle La montaigne defendu, but
they were no sooner put to sea, but the wind falling contrary, the sea rose so
high and so furious withal, yt neither mast, sail, nor cord could hold, but
brake all in pieces: in which manner they continued for the space of ten days
and as many nights, so that neither master nor mariners could tell in what
part they were, for that during that time, the clouds were so thick and the
mist so great, that it made the air so dark and obscure, that those that were
in the ship could scarce see one the other, expecting nothing else (without
the mercy of God) then the overthrow of their ship: which they thought verily
had happened, when they arrived at the rock of the Enchauntresse, whereupon
they were driven about three of the clock after midnight: wherewith the
sailors cast anchor, and going on land, stayed till day appeared.

CHAP. XXXIII. How Esplandian and his company went up unto the broken palace
of the Enchaunteresse, and of the strange things they found there.
ESplandian and his company being on land, not knowing the place where they
were arrived, caused a great fire to be made, about the which they thought to
lie down and sleep, but they heard such a noise from the top of the rock,
that they were all abashed: with that the wind began to cease, and the sea to
wax calm, the sky showing full of stars, and withal the moon shone so
bright, that it seemed as light as if it had been day: wherefore Esplandian
desirous to know what the noise might be, determined to mount up the rock,
but he was counseled by his company to stay till the next day in the morning.
When Esplandian knew it certainly to be the rock of the Enchauntresse, and
said unto the king of Denmark: In good truth I think I have been here
before and take it to be the place whether the great Serpent brought me the
same day I received the order of knighthood, which puts me in better hope
of our voyage then I had before: which he said, remembering the scroll with the
prophecy that he found in the lions paw. Then he told the king of Denmark how
he conquered the sword he bare, the death of the serpent, and all yt he had
seen upon the rock, and it is called (said he) the rock of the Enchauntresse.
By God (said Gandalin) you say true, for I remember, that pursuing after a
knight yt led a Gentlewoman away, I found your father king Amadis and Grandasor
here, and the knight likewise yt I sought yt had hidden himself in ye old
palace upon this rock: the^ he told the^ from point to point what had happened
unto him, and the great love ye knight bare unto ye gentilwoma^ he had carried
away by force, but (said he) before we departed she agreed with him, and they
promised marriage to each other, although before ye time she hated him most
deadly: nevertheless, understanding yt the force he used unto her was only done
for ye love he bare her, she clean forgot her former hatred, cha^ging it to a
most exceeding love. In good faith (said Carmelle) as far as I perceive, no
man ought to despair of any thing he takes in hand, no more will I during my
life: which she said in respect of Esplandian, who in time as she thought
might love her, and wholly forget ye Princes Leonorine. And so long they
talked, yt day began to apear, the^ Esplandian said to ye king of Denmark:
Companion, I pray you stay here form while I go up, for I will have no body with
me but Gandalin and Enil, and they shall go with me, not yt I fear any danger yt
may happen unto me, but only because they may help me to lift up ye tomb whereof
I told you eue^ now. My lord (said ye king) I pray you offer me not so much
injury, for I will not leave you though it cost me my life, especially in this
place where I have most great desire to see that I never saw before. Seeing it
is your pleasure (said Esplandian) let us go, and let our squires bring some
victuals with them, if we need to eat before we come back again: which the
squires did, wherewith they began to mount up ye rock, and traveled so long,
that about sun setting they came unto the hermitage, where ye great image was
erected, whereof you heard before, where they stayed all night, the next day
they traveled again, and came unto the lake yt ran before the old palace, and
because it began to be dark, they determined not to travel any further for ye
time, and to say the truth they were weary: but all night ye serpe^ts ye issued
out of their holes to drink of the water, ceased not to hiss and pass before
and about them to assail them, which they had not failed to do, had it not
been for the virtue of Esplandians sword, whereunto no venomous things might
once approach or come near. Nevertheless they rested not, but as soon as they
might see, rose up and went on their way: and passing by the ruinated
momuments, they came unto the palace of the enchantresse, where they found ye
gates shut, whereat Esplandian gave so great a blow with his foot, yt they
opened, and they entered into the place where the shining tomb stood with the
lion upon it. Then Esplandian said unto the three knights: In good faith when I
was here before, I could not lift up this plate, I pray you each man prove
what you can do, then I will see if I be grown stronger in the back the^ I was
at that time: wherewith the king of Denmark assailed to do it, but what
strength so ever he used, it was impossible for him, the like did Gandalin and
Enil, but they sped no better then the king, whereat Esplandian began to laugh,
and taking it by the two ends, lifted it up so easily as if it had been a piece
of dry wood, yet was it a piece of crystal of three fingers thick, and about
ten or twelve foot long: under it they found an azure stone, the fairest and
most orient color yt ever was seen ye covered a Ceader chest which smelt as
sweet as any balm, ye chest being shut with a loc^^^ emerald stone, having a
key of diamo^ds yt hong by it at a cha^^ of fine gold, al most artificially
composed: the stone taken up and ye chest opened, they found the image of
Jupiter lying therein all of massy gold, garnished with many pearls, rubies,
and other inestimable rich jewels, especially a crown yt he ware on his head,
about yt which were placed certain Carboncles inform of Greek letters, with
these words.

Jupiter is great god of all gods, and in his right hand he bare a table
co^taining this prophecy, When time shall come, that my art and knowledge shall
fail, the heart of the Hind enclosed herein, and life restored by the^ that
were the cause of death, the Grecian sheep long time norished in pleasant
pastures, shall be constrained to feed on a herb bitterer the^ gal, by means of
the extremity the hu^gry sea wolves shall put the^ unto, whose number shall be
so great, that they shall cover the sea in diverse places, in such wise, that
the poor sheep enclosed in their great forest, and diverse of their lambs
being dead and torn in pieces, their shepherd (having in a manner lost all
hope of restoring the^ again) with anguish of heart and mind, in abundance of
tears shall lament their great misfortune. Then shall come the brave Lions
whelpe, by whose means that great troop of wolves shall be driven away and
destroyed. Nevertheless, he shall take from the sheepeheard his great power,
and the best beloved of his sheep, whereupon he shall seize, in such sort, that
his strong teeth and sharp claws shall enter into her heart, and the
entrails of her body, the rest of the flock resting in the power and
government of him and his fierce company, whereby not long after it shall come
to pass, that the great deceitful Serpent, the inchaunted sword, and this
high rock, shall sink into the bottom of the sea, and shall never after be
seen again of any man.

But although Esplandian understood the Greek tongue, yet could he not give
any interpretation or exposition to this prophecy, no more could any of his
company: wherefore they determined not to stay long about the same, but were
more busied to behold the stones and great riches they saw within the tomb,
which they determined to take with them, and return unto their ships without
staying any longer, for their victuals began to fail: wherefore Esplandi^^
willed Carmelle to take the Lion, he and the king of Denmark took the plate
of crystal, Gandalin and Enil the azure stone, and the Squires the Ceader
chest with the Image of Jupiter. And in that sort they issued out of the
palace, descending down the rock, till about evening they came unto ye
hermitage, where they stayed all night: the next day they went on till they
found their ship, wherein about sunsetting they embarked themselves: and
because Esplandian would not be seen in Constantinople without the great
Serpent, he commanded the master of the ship to direct his course to the
castle called La montaigne defendu, which he did. But having sailed about two
days and more, as the king of Denmark sat talking with Esplandian about the
letter that was sent unto him, he asked him if he thought not good yt he
should make a voyage unto ye Princess Leonorine to understand the truth of her
affection toward him. For (said he) it may be Gastilles has mistaken her
words, or the Emperor himself has commanded him to write unto you in such
sort, yt thereby you should make the more have to go thither: at the least I
shall know of her what her pleasure is, and how you shall govern your self in
respect of her. Ha my good friend (said Esplandian) you have touched me now even
at the quick, If you would do me so much favor, you shall bind me for ever
unto you: mean time I will stay for you in the gulf where I found you with
Frandalo, when we raised ye siege of the castle La montaigne defendu, Assure
your self (said the king) I will do my good will. There was belonging to their
ship a little Pinnace, which the master took with him (besides the boat) to
save himself and his people if any tempest should happen, wherein the king with
certain martiners to guide him entered, and taking their leave of Esplandian,
sailed forwards with so good a wind, yt in short space they lost the sight of
ye great ship. But the next night following there happened such a tempest, that
at the break of day their Pilot knew not where he was, and without knowledge
of the place he was constrained to abandon the Pinnace unto the mercy of the
waves, which continued for the space of forty days together, in which time
they endured so many fortunes, that it would be ouertedious to recount them,
and we should likewise digress from the matter whereinto we are entered, to
bring our history unto an end. ^et it therefore suffice you to know, that their
victuals being spent, they chanced to arrive in the Island of the Giant
Drapheon, where ye king of Denmark and his squire lost their wits and became
mad, by force of a water that they drunk out of a fountain called The fountain
of Forgetfelnesse, that sprang in that Isle, where they were taken and kept in
a cruel prison, from whence in short time after they were delivered by the
means of a Gentlewoman that fell in loud with the king, and caused him to
recover his health, arms, horse, and a ship, with all things necessary for
himself and his squire, and having done, she with them put to sea: and
coasting the country of Treuisane, they came unto an Island where the people
of the country would have burnt a Gentlewoman because she could not find a
knight for to maintain her quarrel: but ye king fought for her, and overcame
him that accused her, and taking the Gentlewoman with him, put to sea again,
and sailing six days together along the coast, he perceived a maid out of a
tower, where in the lord of ye country kept her prisoner, for the cause which
she declared to the king out of a window that looked into the sea, for whose
sake the king took land to fight with the lord till he delivered the poor
gentle woman out of prison: such were the adventures of the king of Denmark,
which are rehearsed at large in ye great chronicles, that master Elizabeth
wrote not long after the coronation of Esplandian: wherein the prowess and
adventures of the British knights and others remaining at Alfarin, are
likewise registered and orderly set down. For this time content your selves to
understand the manner how and in what sort Esplandian and the Princess
Leonorine saw each other, how afterward Vrganda came to Constantinople, of ye
armies both ^y land and sea, of the cruel battle between the Turks and
Christians: which ended, our history likewise shall be finished, but having
many things to describe, before I come to that point, we will return to
Esplandian, that was not smally abashed at the long absence of the King,
expecting from day to day some news of him, that had left his company only for
the cause you heard before.

CHAP. XXXV. How Esplandian having stayed Garinter king of Denmarks return
about two weeks space, and perceiving no news of him, determined (by the
counsel of Carmelle) to go in person to the city of Constantinople.
AFter that Garinter King of Denmark had set sail toward Constantinople as
it is said before, Esplandians ship arrived at the gulf where he promised to
stay, and there lay at anchor for the space of two weeks, not hearing any news
of his desired message: wherewith he doubted either that the king of Denmark
should be drowned, or that fortune had carried his vessel some other way:
wherefore he thought to send one of his mariners to enquire of him. But before
he did it, he determined first to speak with Carmelle, and taking her aside,
said unto her: My great friend, you know for what cause the king of Denmark
left us, and the reason of his voyage, as also the promise he made unto me to
return again with all speed, but we can hear no news of him at all, which
makes me assuredly believe either he is dead, or that the storm he was in
has cast him in some country so far off, that he cannot by any means do as
he has promised, wherefore I pray you give me your advise what I were best to
do: for those that are in the like mind that I am, although in some things
they have their understandings whole and perfect, yet are they commonly to
seek in that which concerns them as touching those points. My lord (said
she) seeing it is your pleasure to use my counsel, I will tell you truly what I
think therein, and so much I can assure you, that if you should search
throughout the world, you shall hardly find one that can come near me in
judging the passion wherewith you are molested: for the same is in me that is
in you, and I feel it as well as you do, and it may be more, but the ease
and great contentment I receive by your presence, have given me so many
remedies, that I delight in my grief and live not, but only to cause my sorrow
to endure. To tell you truth, at such time as you began to use speeche^ unto
me of the king of Denmark, I thought upon his long ab^ente, and me thinks
it were best we sailed unto Constantinople, assuring you that I have devised a
means to bring you unto the Princess Leonorine, whereby you may both see and
speak with her, without being known of any other then her self, if you
think it good. And to bring it to pass, (we being arrived there) it shall be
necessary that all those of our ship be advertised (if any man asks for you)
to say, that you stayed in the castle La montaigne defendu, mean time you
shall lie in the bottom of the ship, and I with Gandalin and Enil, will go
unto the Emperor, to whom I will say that you sent me to the Princess
Leonorine, to present unto her in your behalf, that which you have conquered
in the rock of the Enchauntresse, and for the rest let me alone. When
Esplandian heard her speak in that manner, he beheld her for a while, and at
last said unto her: My good friend, I fear not death, neither can it be more
bitter or sharper unto me then the life I now endure: but I fear the dishonor
of my lady, and the injury that thereby I might do unto ye Emperor, who by his
courtesy has so much bound my father unto him, as if I should wrong him, it
would be a blemish to my honor while I live. Nevertheless, I am content to
hazard my self in all the dangers you shall think convenient: that is sufficient
(said Carmelle) I pray you then be merry and make good cheer: for if ever woman
accomplished the thing she took in hand, I will bring this to pass. Wherewith
leaving Esplandian, she called ye Patron, and willed him to set sail for
Constantinople, whereunto he obaied, and had so good a wind, ye within three
days after they entered into ye haue^: where being arrived, Esplandian told his
men what (by the counsel of Carmelle) he had determined to do, co^ma^ding the^
expressly not to make it known to any man of his being there, but yt they
should say they left him in ye castle La montaigne defendu. For (said he) I am
not now in such estate as I would be to present my self before so great a
prince as ye Emperor is. And to the end you be not found liers, I will stay in
the bottom of the ship till you return again: then he, Carmelle, Gandalin
and Enil spoke together, where the gentlewoma^ showed the^ at large how she
meant to bring her enterprise to pass, I will presently (said ^^e) cause the
(...) he we brought from ye rock of ye enchauntresse to be set up in ye same
sort we found it, upon ye hatches of the ship the^ will I go tell the emperor yt
I have one of the singularest things abord ye ship yt ever was seen, and we
find means to bring him hither, where I will show him the lion with Jupiter, and
all the rest of the furniture, which having seen and peruse^, I will tell him
that you send it to the Princess Leonorine, He being gone unto his palace, you
shall go into the Ceader chest, and so will I cause you to be carried into the
princess chamber lying in the arm, whereof I will secretly advertise her, and
by this means ^he may speak to you; and you to her what you think good. I
(...) (said E^plandian) tell me how I shall come out again? I will desire her
(said she) to give me the ceader theft, therein to be by the body of Marroco
that died a Christian, wherein you shall had in closed, and tomorrow in the
morning I will cause you to be brough^^ (...) again. By God (said Gandalin) it
is the prettiest devise that ever I heard, and now I confess that I was never
but a fool in regard of Carmelle. Meddle you not with any thing (said she)
but rest content, let me alone to work my will, and to the same end let us
presently begin: then Esplandian went down into the bottom of the ship, and
the gentlewoman prepared the tomb as she had determined before: with that
she, Gandalin, and Enil, landed and went unto the Emperor, whom they saluted
most honorably, but Carmelle did him no reverence: for (as it is said before)
she esteemed not of any man living how great a Prince soever he were, but only
of Esplandian: she and Gandalin were known in Constantinople by reason of
their being there before. Wherefore the Emperor received Gandalin very
courteously, and with smiling countenance said unto him: Friend Gandalin,
although your presence has procured great melancholy in my mind, remembering
I have often seen you here with the man, that in all Christendom I most
entirely love, whom I am utterly persuaded I shall never see again, yet you
are heartily welcome, and I pray you tell me how does the knight with the
Green Sword. My lord (said Gandalin) it is long since I left him to come into
this country, nevertheless I am assured wheresoever he is, he is a Prince
ready to do your grace any pleasure he can. In good faith (said the Emperor)
I believe it well, and I am glad of the honor I understand he has received
at the hands of king Luisart, that voluntarily has deposed himself of all
princely dignity to inuest him therewith. My lord (said Enil) that is true, I
can assure your Grace thereof as one that was present as his Coronation: and
although I could wish king Amadis the Monarch of all ye world, Truly when I
beheld the gesture and humble countenance of good king Luisart I could not
refrain weeping; for compassion I had to see him, and not I only, but all the
people that beheld him. I pray you, Sir Knight (said the Emperor) show me how
it was, for that all wise men are bound not only to enquire of all virtuous
actions, but also to imitate them as near as possibly they may: with that Enil
showed him at large the whole order of the same, as you heard it before.
Whereat the Emperor (holding down his head) mused for a while, and then said:
I am certainly persuaded it will be long before we find a better prince tha^
king Luisart is, or one yt has passed his young years with more wisdom and
magnanimity of courage, and as I understand, both fortune and virtue have been
favorable unto him: fortune in giving him force to overcome and obtain honor
against diverse misfortunes and hard adventures that she her self had prepared
for him: and virtue, for that in the end of his days she has set him in the
way to enter into paradise. And leaving that d^^course, he changed purpose and
spoke to Carmelle, of whom ^niest he asked, if she were still tormented with
the extreme passions of love toward Esplandian as she had been in times past.
My Lord (said she) if there be any change since I spoke with you, it is, that
the love, servitude, and affection I bear unto him, are augmented in me, and
daily more and more increase. Whereat every man began to laugh. In good faith
(said the Emperor) we may then very well persuade our selves, that you came
not to our Court to move any of our Gentlewomen to love the good knight your
master, although he should expressly command you to do it. My lord (said
she) you judge as in reason it ought to ^e, nevertheless I take so great a
pleasure in serving him to his contentment, that I will except no service
whatsoever: and to speak truth, my arrival here is to ask your Grace a gift,
neither gold nor silver, but only that it would please you to go unto the
haven, to see a Present that my Lord Esplandian sends to the princess
Leonorine as her knight. In good truth (said the Emperor) you require a thing
at our hands, that we should rather desire at yours. Come then my Lord (said
she) for I may not stay long here. With that the Emperor (accompanied of
diverse Noblemen) went unto the haven, and being there, entered into Carmelles
ship, she showed him the crystal tomb, then that of azure stone, and
lastly the image of Jupiter: whereat the Emperor stayed longer to behold it
than the rest, not so much for the richness thereof, as to read the prophecy
it held; and having read it, was not a little abashed: which Carmelle
perceiving, spoke unto him and said: My lord, all this you see has continued
above two hundred years in the broken palace of the inchantresse, yet in all
that time not any knight (how valiant soever he were) could ever conquer the
same, nor yet so much as see it, until my lord Esplandian arrived there, that
is become Lord and possessour of ye same, as you now behold. Truly (said the
Emperor) it is the goodliest present that ever I saw, and worthy the greatest
admiration: for although it be of incomparable riches, yet do I esteem it of
no value in respect of the great science and wonderful knowledge that was in
her to whom it first belonged, as she makes it well appear by the
threatenings she used against us in this table: God grant all may fall out
better than I doubt it will. My lord (said Carmelle) although it be such as you
esteem it, yet do I fear that my Lady your daughter will not make so much
account thereof, that in recompense of the same she will acquit the good
knight Amadis and the master that I serve, of the promise they have made unto
her. I know not that (said the Emperor) but I am well assured, that no earthly
treasure can be comparable unto the valor and virtue of your master: neither
will I ever give my consent that Leonorine shall make that exchange, as
desiring the company of Esplandian, much more than to have all the treasures in
the world within my coffers: and with good reason, for that the wickedest
person living on the earth may be rich of gold and silver, but not of virtue,
which is not abundant unto any but to those that seek it: wherefore if you
think good, carry your presents back again, for Esplandian can not be
acquitted unto us but only by his presence. My Lord (said Carmelle) I am
commanded to leave them with the Princes Leonorine, whether it be upon that
condition or not and if it be your pleasure (seeing she is not come hither with
you) I will cause it to be carried into her chamber. My daughter ((...) the
Emperor) is with her mother the Empress about a mi^^ hence ^^ake the air,
when she comes home you may present it unto her, and assure your self she
will not refuse it: not so much for the value thereof, as for the good I wish
to him that sent it her, as she knows full well. Wherewith he departed out
of the ship, and being a land walked toward his palace, not without much
talk with his knights and noble men, touching the excellency of ye tomb.
Which the more they spoke of, the more they esteemed it, in such manner, that
they all acknowledged never in their lives to have seen so rich nor so
singular a present.

CHAP. XXXVI. How Esplandian was put into the Cedar chest, and with the tomb
carried into the Princess Leonorines chamber, and what conference they had
together.
THe Emperor and his company gone as it is said before, Carmelle called
Esplandian, that in the mean time lay in the bottom of the ship, and told
him the manner of their proceedings, as also the speech the Emperor had with
Gandalin and Enil, and all what had happened, as it is before rehearsed. By my
soul (said Esplandian) I was never in the like pain, for hearing all you
speak, only the lady Leonorine, I could not tell what to think: but when ye
Emperor told you she was not in the city, believe me, it comforted my heart.
Did not I play my part well? said Carmelle. That you did, and as well as one
could wish, (said Esplandian) and if it be true which is commonly said: That a
good beginning makes a good ending, I hope I shall not fail to bring my
purpose to pass. And while they devised together it waxed night, so that the
Empress returned into the city which Carmelle understanding, caused
Esplandian present^^ to lie down in the Cedar chest, in such sort, that the
air entered therein on all sides, and covering it with the Azure and Crystal
stones, Gandalin, Enil, and their Squires took the tomb, and with the
gentlewoman went out of the ship and came unto the palace, where they found the
Lady Leonorine (being already advertised of the goodly Present sent her by
Esplandian) in great devotion staying for Carmelle, for it had been told her,
that in the evening she would bring it to her lodging: wherefore she had no
sooner espied it, but she (with many other ladies and gentlewomen no less
curious to behold ye same) met her in the hall. With that Carmelle (perceiving
her come) stepped forward, and doing reverence unto her, said: Madame, ye good
knight Esplandian sends you this Present, ye not long since he conquered in
the rock of the enchantresse, according to ye good fortune and happy destiny
above a hundred years past predestined of him: which he sends unto you,
expressly to give you to understand the great desire that daily more and more
increases in him to be your faithful knight. But before you proceed further,
it is convenient you grant me two requests: the one, that neither you nor any
other shall look into the tomb until the morning that I return again with
the keye to open a Cedar chest, that you shall find therein: the other, that
after you have opened it you shall give it me, to carry with me to the place,
where my father keeps his hermitage, therein to bury the bones of Matroco
that died a christian, as you have understood. Carmelle my friend (said ye
princes) that am I content to do: nevertheless I am much abashed why
Esplandian deferreth the time so long before he comes to see the Emperor.
Madame (said she) I will tell you that to morrow: mean time, I pray you,
determine where you will have our men to set down their charge. In the great
hall (said Leonorine) that my gentlewomen may see it at their ease. In faith
madame, you shall pardon me (said Carmelle:) this place is too open and over
common to leave so precious a thing standing therein: I deny not to let them
have the pleasure to behold it, but having seen it, for the more safety it
shall be set into your own chamber, whereof you and none other shall have the
keye. With that they that bare the tomb, entered into the hall and set it
down till Leonorine and the rest of the gentlewomen had beheld it long: and if
Carmelle had not been there; assure your selves it had been better visited
than it was: but she would not depart from thence till it was shut up. Which
done, taking her leave, as she went out she took the Princes aside, and
giving her the keye of the chest wherein Esplandian lay, said unto her: Madame,
I leave you in this tomb two inestimable treasures, although their difference
be great, as you may will perceive you being alone: for it is sure, that under
this keye lies the thing, yt in all the world you most desire to see: and
without staying Leonorines answer, she went out of the chamber, and with
Gandalin and his company returned to the ship, leaving the princes in a
marvelous doubt by reason of the words she used unto her: and there with did
so certainly persuade her self, that her friend Esplandian lay dead within
the same, that she was constrained to cause all her gentlewomen to depart the
chamber, only queen Minoresse that stayed to bear her company: with that she
threw her self on her bed, and almost drowned in tears, began to make the
greatest sorrow in the world. Queen Minoresse abashed at so sudden
alteration, knew not what to think, but perceiving her grief to increase still
more and more, went unto her and said: Madame, I pray you hide ye cause of this
sorrow from me no longer, for I swear unto you of my faith, if by any means I
may relieve the same, I will deal therein as for my self. Leonorine that never
ceased sighing, could not answer her one word, but with much importance at the
last answered her and said: Alas my good friend, for Gods cause let me be in
rest, and let it suffice you that you know, that I never was so desirous for to
live, as I am at this present to die. What Madame? (said the Queen) will you
tell me nothing else? No, (said she.) In good faith then (said the Queen) you
shall do me wrong, and I shall have good cause to think the love and favor
that in times past you have shown unto me, to be altogether fained: whereat I
am much grieved, seeing I have borne such a mind to you, that I would never
have failed to hazard not only my honor but my life and soul both for your
sake. When the princes heard her speak with such affection, she was somewhat
better assured, and thereupon said unto her: Seeing you are so desirous to know
the cause, you shall hear it presently, upon condition you shall promise me to
be a means rather to hinder my days than any ways to further them, seeing I
am fully determined to die. You may yet well remember (said she) the first time
yt Carmelle came hither to bring us news of Esplandian, son to the good
knight with the green Sword, that had commandment from his father (as she
said) to come hither to serve us in his place, according to the promise he had
made unto us being in this court: and Carmelle said, that for that cause only
Esplandian had sent her unto Constantinople, to give the Emperor and us to
understand thereof: but there were other matters in the wind, for she came
expressly to entreat me to be good unto her master, who for the great love and
affection he bare unto me, lived in the greatest pain that possible could be.
Whereupon it happened, that being vanquished and overcome with an infinite
number of reasons that she made unto me, I confirmed in my heart, that which
his renown had already imprinted in my mind; and there with determined for to
wish more good to him that to my self: not that I ever thought to commit any
fault that might redound to my dishonor, but only for the glory to have so
worthy a knight ready at my commandment: whereby this fire did so augment in
me, that ever since I could not think on any other thing that upon Esplandian,
with whose love my mind has been to moved, that his long absence has almost
procured my death: yet the hope I had from day to day to see him, has made me
able to sustain my grief with so great patience, that neither you nor any
other, as I think, could ever perceive it in me. But as the Saylor on the sea
being in a tempest, thinking at length to arrive at some haven for to save
himself, suddenly meets with a rock that breaks his ship in pieces: so
I (most unfortunate Lady) hoping by the presence of him I so much desire to
see, to be at the end of my great sorrow, am now fallen into the gulf of
desperation, considering the speech which Carmelle used to me, who speaking
softly, said in this manner: Madame I leave you within this tomb two
inestimable treasures: the one is the thing that in all the world you most
desire to see: which makes me verily think it can be no other thing than the
dead body of Esplandian, and that (as it is very likely) he has desired at
his death to be brought unto me to weep and lament over him, as I mean to do
during the term of my life: which if it pleases God shall not be very long.
And saying so she cast forth a great sigh, sowning in Queen Minoresses arms:
who being abashed to hear the princess use those words so far from ye
estimation she always had conceuied of her, knew not at the ^c^^ what counsel
or comfort to minister unto her: nevertheless considering the extremity she
was in, minding to provide for two accidents that both at one instant presented
themselves, she ran in all have to fetch cold water, which throwing in her
face, she revived again. Where with the Queen said unto her, What Madame, will
you throw the helue after she hatchet? will you be holden for a fool, and
loose the reputation that is spread of you throughout ye world? Where is the
constancy, the modesty, and the wisdom wherewith you were wont to be
adorned? Must you for one word (which you misunderstand) forget your self so
much? Suppose it were true that Esplandian should be dead, can you call him
again by this tormenting your self? For Gods sake be patient, and if the
worst be, you may prove if it be so, and not fall into this kind of fantasy
upon your own imaginations: Carmelle has told you that the thing you most
desire in all the world is enclosed in this tomb: is it therefore to be said
Esplandian should not be alive? Think you he is the first man that has done
the like for his beloueds sake? This I assure you, that although I break ye
tomb and all that belongs to it, I will presently see what may be in it.
Alas cousin (said the Princes) I fear you will see it over soon for me, for
if he be dead (as I think he is) assure your self I will bear him company
before it be day. I pray you (said the queen) be not unhappy before your time,
but let me work the feat: hold then (said Leonorine) here is the keye ye
Carmelle left me: which the Queen took in her hand, and entering into the
chamber where the tomb stood, she lifted up the crystal plate; that done, she
spoke aloud, and asked if any body were within the same: Esplandian (to whom
one hour seemed a whole year) staying for that time, and hearing the Queen
speak, answered presently, and said: I Madame. Who are you? (said Minoresse.)
Madame, said he, I am the happy or unhappy knight Esplandian, yt put my self
into this tomb, ready to receive either death or life, as it shall please the
princes Leonorine to dispose. Are you (said the Queen) Esplandian, son to
the good knight with the Green Sword, that by messages has so often times
promised to come and serve us? I madame (said he) and that to accomplish my
word, have caused my self to be brought hither in this manner. If you will
promise me (said the Queen) and swear not to pass my commandment in that I
shall appoint you to do, I will cause you both to see and speak to her you
desire so much to serve? That will I promise you, (said he) and a greater
matter likewise, so my lady be content. It is enough (said the Queen)
wherewith she lifted up the second plate, and then opened ye chest where in he
lay, and coming out he used great reverence to the Queen, but as then he knew
her not, till she said unto him: Sir Knight, it may be you have heard of me
before this time, I am Minoresse, that to deliver my Lady and you from the
great pain you both endure, has taken you out of this your prison: Wherefore
I pray you stay here a while, till I return again. With that she went unto
the Princess Leonorine (that mean time for fear shook like an aspen leaf:)
and with a merry countenance said unto her: Madame, when we have a long and
hard Winter, it is commonly seen there follows a pleasant Summer: and after
great sorrow comes exceeding joy. You have be wailed your knight Esplandian
for dead, but never in all my life have I seen a dead creature buried that was
so fair, and of so pleasant countenance, as the dead man I have found within
the tomb: I pray you come and see it I be deceived or not. When the Princess
heard the Queen use those words touching Esplandian, and to laugh withal with
joy, her heart leaped in her body, and rising out of her bed, without speaking
any word, she ran presently into the chamber, at the entery whereof, she
espied him she had so much lamented: who presently kneeled down to kiss her
hands. But Leonorine was not as then disposed to use ceremonies, but forgetting
her accustomed modesty, and the gravity required in her sex, especially the
shamefastness that commonly is seen to be in wise and virtuous Ladies, could
not so much command her own affections, but cast her self into Esplandians
arms, kissing him wiih so great affection, as if she had seen, loved, and
known him all her life time. And assure your self, if Queen Minoresse had
not drawn her back, and reproved her lightness, that at that instant those
two lovers had died in the place, for that both their spirits had abandoned all
their vital parts to meet together at their mouths, and to embrace each other,
even to the extremity of their lips, ready to pass further. I say not but ye
Queen Minoresse did the^ wrong: and likewise, if any man would accuse
Leonorine of folly or inconstancy, I answer him again that she is most easily
to be excused both of the one and the other, for although she had never seen
Esplandian before that time, and that in reason she should have known him
better before she showed her self so private unto him, you must suppose (as it
is true) that love had of long time before so well engraven him in her mind, yt
she seized not to see him every day with her inward eyes. And as nature had
studied to make her most perfect in all perfections whatsoever, love had
likewise taken pleasure to make her the best beloved and ye truest lover yt
ever was before her time. Wherefore it is not to be marvelled, if at the first
she showed so good a countenance to her friend, considring ye pain and great
grief she had endured since ye time Carmelle brought her news. These two
lovers being thus before each other ( Esplandia^ still kneeling) seemed to be so
ravished ye queen Minoresse could not refrain to say to Leonorine: Madame, me
thinks you should do well to command the knight to rise up and lead him
into your chamber, where you may talk together while ye night indureth, if you
think geed: but to let him kneel still on the ground, in good faith it is not
well. My good friend (said Leonorine) he has fled from us for almost two years
together, now I mean to keep him so near me, yt he shall not easily escape
away: with that she took him by the hand to lift him up, but he would not
stir but said unto her: Madame, Gastilles not long since sent me word being at
Alfarin, that you were much offended with me, I pray you show me the cause: for
if I ever committed fault against you, it has been only in loving you with all
my heart, as I am bound to do. Nevertheless, if in your advise I seem to have
presumed overmuch, pardon me I pray you, and give me what punishment you shall
think good. My friend (said she) your absence has procured me so great cause
of grief, yt I both pray you and command you, from henceforth not to absent
your self from me long again. Madame (said Esplandian) having (with your leave)
made another voyage to my companions, that may think ill of me, leaving them
in their cheifest need to come hither for my pleasure: I swear unto you of my
faith I will never offend you more in ye manner, or any other way whatsoever. I
am content to grant you that (said she) so you return as soon as possible
you may: and for the rest I will yt from henceforth you love me in such sort,
that not any other but my self shall have power over you, and that you be my
knight: Now I pray you stand up, and I will show you further of my mind. With
ye Esplandian rose up, and Leonorine taking him by the right hand, led him into
her chamber, where she set him a chair, and she sat by him, there they began
to show the pains each of them had endured, in what manner their love did
first begin, who was the mean thereof, and the end whereunto they pretended,
which was their future marriage. In which discourse, they grew into such
alterations, that if queen Minoresse had not been there as witness to their
talk, considering the heat they then were in, I think not, but in time they
would have easily proceeded to a further matter. In that manner the two lovers
passed the night till day began to appear: which queen Minoresse perceiving,
went to Leonorine and said unto her: Madame, the secretest follies are always
best, it is almost day, and it may be the Empress may send some one of her
women, or come her self in person to visit you, for that yesternight very late
it was told her you were not well. I pray you give this knight leave to depart,
and let us shut him in the chest, as we found him at the first. Alas how hard
were those words unto Esplandian, and no less unto the Princess, who
foreseeing the danger that might fall out if they were found together, said
unto him: My good friend, this happy night that has favored us so much, shall
cause you if you think good, to remember the promise you have made unto me: I
pray you let me see you again as soon as possible you may. And as she ended
those words, the queen yt stood as a stout watch, heard some body come up ye
stairs, wherewith being in great fear, she told ye princes Leonorine, which
made Esplandian presently go into ye other chamber, and without having time to
take any longer farewell, laid himself down into the Ceader chest, yet
Leonorine could not abstain, but must of force kiss him before he was shut
in, and as they had laid the crystal plate upon the tomb, Carmelle knocked
at the door, and with her Gandalin and Enil, and the rest of the company that
the night bafore had brought him thither. With that queen Minoresse opened the
do^^ and they entering into the chamber, Carmelle saw Leonorine that came unto
her, to whom after she had done her reverence, she said: Madame, I am
commanded by him that sent me unto you, not to stay any longer here, is it not
your pleasure to give me leave to depart, and cause the chest to be delivered
unto me, according to your promise? Gentlewoman (said the Princess) I have
made you promise thereof, and I will keep it, although I had rather it should
stay together as it is, then to separate it a sunder. Take it when you will,
you shall find it in ye same place where yester night you caused it to be set:
with that the Ladies and gentlewomen being advertised of her rising, came into
her chamber, which hindered Leonorine to speak so secretly with Carmelle as she
would have done, but only gave her the key of the chest, which she caused to
be taken out of the tomb: that done, Gandalin and Enil, and the two squires,
took it up between them and carried it away, Leonorine saying to Carmelle: I
pray you thank the knight (in my behalf) that has had me in so good
remembrance. And find the means, if it be possible that (according to the
promise and messages he has often sent unto the Emperor, part where of have been done by your self) he will as soon as he can, come he^her to see us.
Madame (said she) I will do it with all my heart, as she that desires to
please, serve and obey you. Fail not then (said the Princess) and so God have
you in his keeping. That done, Carmelle followed them that carried Esplandian,
leaving Leonorine accompanied both with joy and sadness: with joy, to have
seen him that she held dearer then her self, and with sadness, for his so
sudden departure. But the hope she had of his speedy return, eased her
grief much. Carmelle having brought her purpose to pass as you heard before,
desiring not to omit any thing that seemed necessary to be done: and to avoid
all suspicion, sent Gandalin and Enil before unto ye ships, and went unto the
Emperor, whom she found walking in the gallery, who no sooner perceived her,
but he asked if the Present that Esplandian sent unto his daughter, were yet
in her ship. No my lord, (said she) I caused it yesternight to be carried
into her chamber as I promised you, and have left it all with her, only that
which was given me for my part. What was that? (said the Emperor.) The Ceader
chest: (said she) wherein (if it pleases God) I will cause the body of Matroco
to be buried, that as yet lies in my fathers Hermitage. But my lord, because
as this morning I determined to sail unto the castle La montaigne defendu, to
him that sent me hither, I pray you give me leave to depart. Gentlewoman (said
the Emperor) when you were last here, I sent him word by you, what joy and
great pleasure it would be unto me for to see him here, I pray you once again
show him what I said: Assuring him, that being here, he shall have of me all
honor and good entertainment we can devise. My lord (said Carmelle) God
preserve your grace and send you life: And therewith taking her leave, she
returned into her ship, where Esplandian and his company stayed for her.

CHAP. XXXVII. How Esplandian put to sea, thinking to arrive at the castle La
montaigne defendu, and of the great adventures he found.
ESplandian entered into his ship, and Carmelle being returned as it is said
before, they determined not to stay longer, fearing to be discovered: wherefore
they caused ankers to be hoised, and setting sail, made toward the castle La
montaigne defendu, but fortune by a great storm and contrary wind carried them
another way, driving them along the coast of Alfarin, where the wind ceased,
they sailing almost hard by the shore, and at the same instant when they espied
among the rocks certain horse and footmen fighting together: whereat
Esplandian marvelled, and said unto Gandalin and Enil: I pray you, seeing we
are arrived here at this instant, let us go see from whence the occasion of
their combat proceeds, and if we may, help them that have the iustest
quarrel. Let us go (said the two knights) wherewith they presently landed, and
mounting on their horses, commanded the sailors to stay for them, and in great
have ran unto the place where the combat was, and approaching the same, they
knew their companions by the white crosses they bare upon their armor, and
seeing them in danger, and enclosed on all sides by great number of Turks,
Esplandian spurred his horse over the stones, and entered into the prease, but
not very far, by reason the Turks kept a strait place, where he must pass,
from whence at the first he was repulsed: Nevertheless in ye end Gandalin and
Enil seconded him so well with the help of those that fought on the other
side, that notwithstanding the great resistance the Turks made, they enclosed
them on all sides, and beat them down: yet some of them by the swiftness of
their horses saved themselves, whereby the Christians remained victors, not
losing one man. The knights that had been aided in ye manner, could not
imagine which way the other three knights came: but when they knew them, never
were men gladder, praising God of his great mercy showed unto the^. Wherewith
Esplandian asked them how they came thither: My lord (said Elianle delibere,)
I and my companions had so much entreated Belleris to lead us into the country,
yt all this night he has been our guide: we being issued out of Alfarin,
thinking to surprise the town of Galatia that lies upon the sea side not far
from hence, and to the same end we stayed in ambush, but perceiving our
enterprise to be discovered, and thinking by little and little to retire, we
were enclosed in such manner yt if God had not helped us by your means, without
doubt we had all been overthrown and destroyed. By the faith of a knight
(said Esplandian) if you had considered the country where we are, and that
the loss of one of our men is greater to us then a thousand others, if we were
in Christendom, you would not have hazarded your selves so much: but what is
past, cannot be undone. And to the end we speedend worse, let us enter into
my ship that stays for me. My lord Esplandian (said Belleris) Occasion is
offered now unto us, and let him go that refuses it, when time serves. You
see the overthrow of the Turks, which is such, that I certainly believe,
there is not one man left within the Town. Wherefore I am of opinion, that we
ride thither in as secret manner as we may, then if we see occasion, we will
set upon the gates, and it may be shall enter the Town without resistance,
mean time send one of your Squires to certefie your sailors, that they sail
unto Alfarin, or else that they stir not from thence before they hear news
of us. This counsel liked them well, and they all agreed unto it: with that
Belleris marched on before, Esplandian and the rest following after, riding
close together upon a Causie, where not far from thence they espied one
sitting upon a sharp rock most hideous to behold, whereat they spurred their
horses thither to see what it might be, where they saw a woman so old,
impotent, and withered, that her breasts hung down beneath her nauill,
apparrelled in a Bears skin, whereon hung her long, white, and knotted
hair, where she had lived among those rocks in all tempests and stormye
weathers for the space of sixescore years together. By which means, her naked
body showed like the bark of an Elm tree or some ancient Oak, whereby not
one of them but began to laugh, asking Belleris if he had heard of her before.
I truly (said he) for she is so near of lineage to king Armato, that she was
his great Grandfathers sister. And although that in her young years she has
been endued with all the gifts of nature, yet would she never marry, what
means soever her friends could use, but gave her self continually to study
the Art of Magic, in such sort, that none could surpass her in the same,
whereby she has foreshowne long time since, that before she died, the land
of Turkye should be overthrown, and brought in subjection unto strangers.
And for this cause thee has caused this Rock to be hewn, wherein she has
made two chambers, where continually she abides, apparrelled in the same
manner you now behold her, and as it is commonly reported, she is very near
ninescore years of age, and that you may know her better, it is she that
caused the gilt pillars with the Tables hanging at them, to be set up at the
aduenturous fountain, which you my lord Esplandian (said he) might
peradventure see, when you found the Princess Heliaxe, and overthrew her guard
in that place. Truly (said Esplandian) I would gladly know how she passes the
time, being so solitary as she is. My lord (said Belleris) that could never be
known, yet it is thought, that she has carried great number of books into
the cave, wherewith she delights her self. I marvel (said Esplandian) why no
man ever adventured to go into the rock? so they have done: (said Belleris)
but they returned again so well beaten and cruelly handeled, that at their
coming forth, some of them died. Let us speak unto her (said Esplandian) and
it may be she will tell us no goodness: wherewith they went nearer unto her,
but she presently rose up and fled into her cave, at the entery whereof she
stayed, saying to Esplandian: Knight, Above a hundred years before thou wast
borne, I did foreshew the destruction of this country by thy arrival here,
therefore I choose rather to lead this miserable and cruel life, then to fall
into thy hands, and live in miserable captivity. With that she went in, and
could no more be seen, whereat they all began to laugh, and without longer
staying went on their way, wherein they perceived coming toward them about
sixty or fourscore knights, all armed ready to fight: whereupon doubting them
to be enemies, they stood still, causing Enil and Belleris to ride forwards to
know the truth, who crossing the field, and staying under a touffe of cork,
they perceived one of the company to bear a red ancient with a white cross,
and therewith they knew Frandalo that marched before them, whereupon they
returned to their companions? who glad of those news, went to meet the^, and
coming in sight each of other, Frandalo thinking to be surprised, willed his
companions to stand close, and ye better to provoke his enemies to fight, he
sent two or three of the best horses in his company to skirmish with the^, but
they perceauing their white crosses knew them presently to be Belleris and his
company that they went to seek, which Frandalo knowing, spurred his horse
forward, much abashed to see Esplandian, whom he verily thought to be in the
castle La montaigne defendu: wherewith they embraced each other, talking of
their adventures past.

CHAP. XXXVIII. How Frandalo and his company of Christian knights, surprised
the town of Galatie, and of their message sent unto the Emperor of
Constantinople by Gandalin, to crave more aid.
THe Christian knights being met together, Esplandian asked Frandalo wherefore
he rode abroad with so great a company: My lord, said he, this morning I was
advertised, that Belleris my nephew had issued by night out of Alfarin with
certain knights, to see if they could meet with our enemies, and fearing they
should find some ambush laid for them that would be stronger than themselves, I
told my lord Norandel your uncle, by whose advise we took this way to follow
him, but for that neither we nor you have met with any company to provoke us to
fight, I pray you let us return again the best way we can unto Alfarin: but
you my lord said he, what adventure has brought you hither in so good time to
find us here? What adventure? (said he) Truly you may well term it so: for
Gandalin, Enil, and I, thinking to sail unto the castle La montaigne defendu,
fortune by tempest of weather, drove our ship so near this coast, that we
might plainly behold Belleris and his company fighting against a great number
of the enemy, that had driven them among the rocks: whereupon we landed, and
entered so far among the enemies, that in the end the victory was ours: after
that by your nephews counsel we were riding toward Galatie, the which (as
he assures us) will be easily gotten without great resista^ce, considering
the overthrow we have already given them. Truly (said Frandalo) it may well
be so, and seeing fortune most commonly aideth all hardy adventurers, let us
go forward, and follow me, for I know a way whereby I will bring you thither
without being discovered. Let us go (said Esplandian) and with that they
followed Frandalo that went softly before them, till they came unto a little
hill within a mile of Galatie, from whence they might easily perceive who
issued or entered the town: where they beheld great numbers of men as well
horsemen as footmen, who being advertised of the overthrow of their men, went
to succor them, thinking to find the christians in the place where they had
fought, but they were behind them: which the two knights (they had sent out to
discover) perceiving, ran to advertise Frandalo and his company, who being
glad of the news, went forward in great have, and suddenly set upon the
gates, where slaying the watch, they entered and took the town, wherein there
were none but impotent and weak people to defend the same: which done, they
drew the Bridges, and went upon the walls to keep watch, and to behold the
enemies countenance at their return, when they understood thereof, which was
not long after, for a country man leaping over the walls, ran presently to
advertise them. If they were sorry it is not to be doubted, for that besides
the loss of their goods, they lost their wives and children, thinking they
should all be sent prisoners into a strange country, whereat they were much
grieved: but one Knight among the rest being a man of some stomach,
perceiving their sorrow, badde them be of good courage, animating them in such
sort, that they all determined either to loose their lives or else to win the
town again: and thereupon (more moved with rage than with reason) they
returned to the town, and assailed it in such furious and indiscrete manner,
that a great part of them lost their lives in the assault, being repulsed and
driven away by Frandalo, Esplandian, Enil, Gandalin, Elian, Tiron, and ten
other of the most principal Christian knights: who to increase more fear in
the Galatians, issued out of the town and slew a great number of them: but as
a Cat that is enclosed and assailed (before she begins to defend her self)
seeks by all means to shun and avoid the fury of the man, and finding her
self out of her hole, and no means of succor left her, becomes so furious
and bold, that she begins to assail him, from whom she first fled
away, and often times does him mischief: So these poor people, seeing nothing
but present death before their eyes, by reason of the chase that the ten
Christian Knights made after them, being wholly desperate and out of all hope
of obtaining mercy, began to take courage again, and in such sort, that
desiring to revenge their lives, they turned their faces toward the enemy
with such courage, that having set upon the Christians, in the end Frandalo was
stricken down, Esplandian and the rest being enclosed in such manner, that
they had all lost their lives in that place, had they not been aided of their
companions, and night that came upon them: which was the cause they left each
other: whereupon the Christians returned into the town, and the Turks rode
toward Tesifante to the Prince Alphorax, who being advertised of their
misfortune, to comfort them, spoke unto them and said: My friends, I am not a
little sorry for your losses, whereunto (if our gods permit us) I will take
such order, and be revenged in such sort, that it shall be spoken of so long as
the world endures. For I hope not only to drive these thieves out of my
country, but to go in person to spoil and utterly destroy the city of
Constantinople, with his wicked and accursed Emperor, and all the Christian
Monarchy. Which to bring to pass, it is not long since I sent my Ambassadors
unto my friends and allies, who have all given me their promise to aid and
succor me with their forces and powers, whereof some are already arrived at
Tenedo, where we (upon certain matters touching our countries) are to
assemble together: and staying the time till I have means to do better for
you, I will give order that certain money shall be given you to sustain your
wants: For the which the citizens of Galatia thanking him most heartily,
remaining in Tesifant, where they continually lamented their great losses: on
the other side Esplandian, Frandalo, and the rest of the knights that had
gotten the town, considering with themselves, that it would be impossible for
them to keep and defend so many places with so few men, agreed among them to
send Gandalin to Constantinople unto the Emperor, to show him what they had of
late done to Alphorax, and won the town of Galatie, being one of ye most
famous havens in all those parts, and for that cause besought him to send them.
Gastilles or some other of his captains, with some forces to aid them:
otherwise they should be constrained either to leave Galatie or else Alfarin,
considering their small number and the continual alarmes that the enemies gave
them, and the better to move him thereunto, they sent him the greatest part of
the rich jewels they had conquered in the town. But they had neither Bark nor
Pinnace ready to send, wherefore they were constrained to take yt wherein
Esplandian came thither: which at that time (as fortune would) lay still at
anchor staying their pleasure. Wherewith Esplandian sent Sergil to cause the
ship to come thither: which done, and Gandalin ready to imbarke himself,
Esplandian took him aside, and said unto him: Friend Gandalin, you have
always been faithful and trusty to my father, which gives me cause to
disclose my secret unto you before all others. When you come to Constantinople
(said he) you shall see the Lady Leonorine, to whom you shall present my most
humble commendations, showing her, that I will not fail very shortly to
accomplish my promise and her commandment, and withal you shall present her
the two slaves that were given me, which I send to wait upon her, that by their
presence she may have me in remembrance: and knowing you are not to learn how
to use your speeches in such cases, I pray you Gandalin let me find in you that
which I expect. My Lord (said he) God give me grace to do you service. Then
fare you well (said Esplandian.) With that Gandalin with all his charge entered
into the ship, and having set sail, had a good wind, that in short time after
he arrived in Constantinople: where being landed, he caused two squires to
bear the presents he had brought; and entering into the palace, he found the
Emperor talking with diverse of his Noble men: the Emperor perceiving him, went
to embrace him, asking him where he had left the good knight Esplandian, and
whether he meant not shortly to come and see him. My Lord, said Gandalin, he
commends himself most humbly unto your Grace, and has sent you word by me,
that not above fifteen days past, he, Frandalo, and others of our company
have taken the town of Galatie. Galatie? (said the Emperor) By ye faith I
bear to God, that is good news: for as I have been informed heretofore, it is
one of the richest towns in all Turkey, but I know not well how they can keep
it. Full well my lord (said Gandalin) so it be your pleasure to send them some
aid: otherwise they shall be constrained in the end, either to abandon that to
keep Alfarin, or Alfarin for that: which would be a shame for them, and great
dommage both to your Grace and all Christendom. Have they found great riches
therein (said the Emperor) or have they lost any quantity of their men? My lord
(said Gandalin) some of the enemies were slain in the taking thereof: and with
that he began to show him the manner how it was done, and causing the cases
wherein the presents were, to be opened, among other things he showed him the
images of Nabuchodonosot king of Assiria, of Alexander the great, and that
which he most esteemed, the true and lively representation of Hector of Troy,
armed at all points, as he was when he fought against the Grecians: and surely
the Emperor had reason to make so much account thereof, for that Agamemnon was
content to receive it for his part, as being esteemed to be the richest jewel
in all the city of Troy, for that Hector himself had caused it purposely to
be made while the Grecians lay before the city, by one of the cunningest
workmen that could be found, and set it upon the chief gate of the palace of
Ilion, which long time after fell into the hands of the kings of Turkey, that
had erected it in the market place of Galatie, placing it upon a high marble
pillar, which Gandalin showed unto the Emperor, as he hard reported in the
country: wherewith the Emperor was so well pleased, that he could not
refrain to say: In good truth I should not be better pleased with the taking
of the City of Tesifante, then I am at this time with this goodly Present, and
I pray you tell ye knights that sent it, yt I thank them for it with all my
heart. My lord (said Gandalin) so they did think it would be more acceptable
unto your grace the^ all the vessels of gold and silver yt they found within
the Town, part whereof they have likewise sent unto you, that are in this
other case, which he presently caused to be opened, and after they had
perused them, Gandalin caused the two slaves that Esplandian sent, to come
nearer, presenting them to the Princess Leonorine, saying unto her: Madame,
the good knight Esplandian not knowing what greater Present to offer you (next
unto himself) then these two young maids, he sends them unto you as your
slaves, to the end every man may know, that as you are the goodliest lady that
ever nature framed, so is there not any creature living on the earth, that
better deserves to command such as command others, then your self: wherefore
if you show him the courtesy to accept them at his hands, he will esteem it
for one of the greatest favors that ever he received. Leonorine that knew as
well how to dissemble her affections as any woman living on the earth: And
desiring to have the same opinion, that always had run of her, to continue
still, with a dissembled kind of anger, answered Gandalin and said: Sir
knight, it seems by your words, that Esplandian is disposed to mock me, and
that you esteem me to be a woman of light credit, could you of your faith
think me so very a child, that I should not well perceive, (that if Esplandian
were so much at my commandment as you say) he would not have deferred the
time so long to come hither unto us, were it only but to acquit the promise
king Amadis his Father made us above six or seven years past. But I know his
mind full well, he means to content us with words, and many messages that
from time to time he sends, together with an infinite number of excuses, but
all to no purpose, whereof while I live I will not accept one of them for his
discharge: let him therefore come himself, and then it may be I will believe
that to be in him, I have so oftentimes heard reported. When the Emperor
heard her speak in that sort, he showed by his countenance that he took
great pleasure at his daughters choler, and said unto her: My sweet friend,
what will Gandalin say to see you so discourteous toward him, that honors you
so much: I pray you sweet heart moderate your color, and take that he
sends, for if you refuse it, he shall have great occasion to dislike
thereof: And you see that for your sake he does so many valiant acts, that
the good knight with the Green sword could never do the like. My lord (said
she) I believe for valor he is not inferior unto his father, but for
courtesy his father surpasses him. In faith Madame (said Gandalin) if you
knew him as well as I do, it may be you would commend him more then now you
blaspheame him, seeing that if he has deferred the time to come hither, it is
only because he thinks he has not as yet done sufficient in arms,
whereby he should deserve one spark of favor at your hands, considering
your estate and the small valor that is in him, although at this day he is
esteemed the best knight that ever bare arms for these hundred years.
Nevertheless, seeing you accuse him of that, that ought most to excuse him, I
promise you of mine honor, leaving all things apart, presently upon my
return he shall come hither unto you, to do whatsoever it shall please you
to command him. Gandalin (said the Princess Leonorine) think not
(whatsoever I say) that I either take pleasure or displeasure at his presence
or his absence, but only as my Father does, and I for his sake, knowing the
great love and affection he has always born to King Amadis his Father, and
continues the same to his son. But hereof am I well assured, that he cannot
so excuse himself, or make us think other, then that herein he has done us
wrong. Nevertheless, seeing it is the Emperors pleasure, I will keep the
Present he has sent me, upon the promise and assurance you have made of his
coming hither as soon as you shall be arrived at Galatia. Truly Leonorine
played her part, very cunningly herein: for hardly would it have been thought
or once imagined, that Esplandian and she had so faithfully given their hands
and hearts as they had done in the presence of queen Minoresse, as you heard
before, and Gandalin for his part knew not what to think, although he had borne
Esplandian in the tomb, and set him in her chamber as you likewise heard. Then
the Emperor asked him how long he meant to stay. My lord (said Gandalin) as
little as I may, for it were not fit for me to line at rest, while my
companions are in arms: Wherefore I most humbly beseech your grace to give me
my dispatch as soon as possible you can. Gandalin, (said the Emperor) I will
presently send for my admiral, and will cause men in all have to be prepared,
that within six or seven days they shall be ready to depart. With that he
went into the Garden to recreate himself, and the Ladies with him: where when
Gandalin perceived Leonorine in an herbor of Myrtle trees, walking pensiuely
alone, he went unto her and said: Madame, my lord Esplandian commanded me to
certefie your grace, that since the time he departed from you, and that he
received so great favor at your hands, his heart (that wholly is yours) has
so longed after you, that he has thought to die a thousand times with grief,
for the loss of your presence. And to say the truth, I have known many men
troubled with the passions of love: but I certainly believe there was never
his like, nor that more wisely could dissemble it, which makes me greatly to
doubt his person. For that it is impossible, considering the grief he still
indureth, together with the small comfort he receives of his familiar
friends, (not knowing his disease) but that he must in short time end his
days: whereby great dommage should then arise unto all Christendom,
considering the strange beginning of Knighthoode and great Prowess that is in
him: which is such, as that if he continue as he has begun, he will bring
that order in greater estimation then ever it has been before: wherefore
Madame, seeing I have always (as it may be you are already advertised) been
a servant to his father, and that I am acquainted with the nature of his
son, and the danger wherein he is like to fall into, if you show him not
some favor, I have presumed to show your Ladyship the hard case wherein he
was when I left him, as also that he has expressly commanded me to asure
you, that his only intent and desire is to be in your presence. Yet perceiving
the danger wherein his companions do remain, he knows not what excuse to make,
whereby he might take occasion for to leave them: wherefore he be seecheth you
to impute his long absence unto fortune, and not to him that is born only to
love, serve, and obey you. In uttering whereof Gandalin showed so sorrowful a
countenance, that he made Leonorine ready to weep, In which kind of office
he had so well ben exercised from his youth, that no man could surpass him in
the same. Friend Gandalin (said ye princess Leonorine) I know not what you
mean I should do for him more then already I have done, nor yet for what cause
you should imagine that I seek to be the means of his death: seeing that if he
were but sick, I know my self so feeble and impatient, that with grief and
sorrow I should not be able to live one hour after. Let it therefore be far from
you, once to think that I would ever be any other man's then only his: and
think it not strange, if in the Emperors presence, or before the world, I
dissemble as I do, for I would not in any case, that the least inckling of the
burning love wherein my heart continually flameth toward him, should as yet
be once perceived, chiefly for the great good I wish unto him. Madame (said
Gandalin) I am well assured he will receive an extreme pleasure to hear these
news, and yt he will leave all things to come hither, if you think it good.
That is my desire (said she) and I pray him so to do, and you to persuade him
thereunto. While they were devising, Tartarie the admiral (so called of the
place of his birth) entered into ye garden: being a man issued of a mean house,
but advanced unto great authority by his great wit and valiant courage, so that
he commanded over all ye Grecian seas. The Emperor and he talked long time
touching Gandalins message, concerning aid to be sent unto Galatia, and in the
end he willed in all have to prepare thirty galleys and Foistes, with two
thousand of the best soldiers he could find to man the same. The admiral
Tartary according to his charge, executed his commission in such sort, that
within six days after he was ready with his navy to set sail, and depart
from thence.

CHAP. XXXIX. How Vrganda arrived at Galatia, and of the danger wherein she
was by the subtletie of Melie the Enchauntresse.
THe admiral Tartarie and Gandalin having taken their leaves of the Emperor,
set sail, and passed the straights of Constantinople, and without any
adventures, arrived at Galatia within one week after their departure: if they
were well received by the Christian knights, it is not to be doubted, for their
number was so small and so dispersed, that they were in doubt to be able to
keep that Town, with Alfarin, and the castle La montaigne defendu. But when
they saw such aid, they were in better hope, and having received the admiral,
they divided their two thousand men, as need required. Mean time Esplandian had
no small desire to know of Gandalin if he had spoken with the Princess
Leonorine, and how she did: for the which cause being in his chamber, he sent
for him. Where talking together, Gandalin showed him from point to point what
speeches had passed between the Princess and him, not only before the
Emperor, but also in the garden. And of my faith sir (said he) you do her
wrong, considering the good means you have both to satisfy her and your self:
for what excuse soever you can make, you are not so sore charged on this side,
that you may not spare some time to go and see her, which she craves at your
hands. That I will do (said Esplandian) but I must find the means; take you
care for yt (said Gandalin) and let me go sleep, for I never had more need:
Go (said Esplandian) and be here again betimes in the morning. Wherewith
Gandalin took his leave, leaving Esplandian alone in great care how he might
find some convenient excuse to leave his companions in ye extremity, but God
provided for him: for ye same night about an hour before day as he began to
slumber, he heard a most pleasant sound of music, which you must understand,
came out of the great serpent yt he left in the castle La montaigne defendu,
which at ye time was arrived before the town of Galatia, but little did he
think of any such thing, or yt Vrganda had been therein, because he thought her
to be in great Britain. This mellody continued for the space of half an
hour and more, which done, he heard such a noise of trumpets Clarigals,
Phifes, and Tabers, yt sounded so high, yt the sentinels of the town thought
verily the enemies navy had been arrived before the same to lay siege unto it:
whereupon they caused an alarm in the town, each man running to the walls,
being all of that mind till day, when they might be hold the great serpent
(wherein Vrganda was) all hung with long pennons and streamers: whereat
Esplandian was so glad, that going down unto the Haven, he presently entered
into a boat with Talanque, Manely, and diverse other of the principal
captains to see who might be there. And rowing near unto it, they knew
Vrganda that stayed for them on the hatches, and stretching forth her arms,
spoke unto them and said: My good friends, you are most heartily welcome, I pray
you come up into my ship, yt I may embrace you. With that Esplandian entered,
and as he meant to salute Vrganda, she kneeled on the ground to kiss his feet,
whereat he being ashamed took her up, and said unto her: Madame, I never
thought you would have taken pleasure to mock with me, seeing I account my self
much more bound to you then to any creature living in the world. And therefore
for Gods cause, if at any time I chance to offend you, punish me I pray you
in some sort or other. Most happy Knight, (said she) The aid I hope for at
your hands before many days shall pass, moved me to do as I have done,
wherefore I beseech you take it in good part. And with that she embraced him,
and after him, Talanque, Manely, and all the rest, every man doing her great
honor, desiring her to show them the cause of her so sudden coming
thither. My good friends (said she) you shall know it at some other time when
better laisure serves: mean while I am to tell you that it is necessary for
you shortly to go unto the city of Constantinople, where you shall enter all
armed and apparelled in ye same armor I have brought hither for you, and thus
must I tell you, that if you should defer it till another time, it would be
prejudicial to you all. Wherefore I counsel you to do it upon the first day of
the next week, assuring you to be as well received of the Emperor, as ever
were any knights, which your ease and pleasure in his company, shall continue
until ye rolling wheel of Fortune turning about, shall bring with it many
travels, passions, and adventures, which shall cause many greefes and sorrows
both to you and others. And the better to make you believe that all I say is
true, I tell you that I my self shall fall into two of the greatest dangers of
my life that ever I had, whether it be here or in another place I know not.
And which is worse, I cannot by any means avoid the same, not knowing any cause
how nor wherefore it should be so, although it be in a manner ready to fall
upon me. Madame (said Esplandian) before you shall receive any hurt in our
presence, we will all lose our lives to succor you. My good child (said she)
man's destiny of force must be accomplished. But I pray you let us enter into
some other talk, for this makes me melancholy. Madame (said Manely) Is it
not your pleasure to go into the Town? I (said she) and I pray you send for
Norandel, who at this present I know is at Alfarin, and I will give you as
great cause to rejoice as ever you had: for that within my ship I have
brought the king of Denmark, wounded in a combat that he fought against
Garlante Lord of the Isle of Calafre, that by force would have taken two
Gentlewomen from him. And although Garlante be esteemed a hardy and valiant
knight, yet did the king bring him in such case, that unless he had craved
mercy, the king would have stricken of his head: which he spared upon
condition, that during his life he should never after injury any knight, which
Garlante swear and vowed in my presence, for that by chance arriving there,
during their combat, I heard what passed between tham. And because I
perceived the King to be in danger of his person by reason of ye great number
of wounds he had upon his body, I would not leave him, but caused him to enter
into my ship, and laid him in the best bed, where now he is almost healed.
Ha (said Esplandian,) What good news are these, of my faith I thought verily
he had been dead: wherefore madame, I pray you for Gods cause let me crave the
means to see him: with ye Vrganda led him where he lay, but when they saw each
other, Esplandian could not refrain weeping, with the great pleasure he took
to see the king. Nevertheless, for yt time they had no great speech together,
neither would Vrganda permit them to do it, doubting least the king (being yet
but weak and feeble) might thereby be hindered of his health. Wherefore she
caused Esplandian to go forth, and entering with her into ye boat, they rowed to
the shore, from whence they led Vrganda to the best lodging in the town, with
as much honor as they could have done to the Queens Brisenne or Oriane, if any
of the^ had been there in presence. The next day Esplandian pitying the great
number of women and little children yt had been kept within the town from the
time yt it was taken, said to his companions, that it would be better to give
them leave to depart from thence, then to hold them still, for ye the longer
they continued in ye town, the more charge they put them to: and to keep them
prisoners (said he) or in longer servitude, God may possible be offended with
us. Wherefore if you will believe me, using rather mercy then rigor toward
them, I am of opinion yt we send them al to Tesifant to the Princess Heliaxe,
who will thank us for it, and so shall we be ri^ of so much charge. To this all the knights agreed, and Carmelle was appointed to execute the message, and he
yt had seen the great number of people yt were about her, especially women,
weeping most bitterly to behold themselves banished and driven from their own
houses, surely he could not choose unless he were hard hearted, but have pitied
their estate. But let them go, and let us hear what danger fell unto Vrganda
the next day after, who being welcome to the knights, took great pleasure to
hear them show of the adventures they had found in the Turkish country, since
the taking of Alfarin. And each man after the other discoursing what they
knew, Esplandian remembered the old woman they had seen among the rocks, where
she continued, whereat he could not choose but smile, which Vrganda espying,
asked him the cause. Madame (said he) I thought upon the beauty of a young
maid, yt I and some of our company chanced to see not far hence, being the best
furnished of all things for to beautify her yt might be found, and ye better
to describe her unto you, I can assure you (upon Belleris word) yt it is at the
least eight or nine score years since she first could go and speak, yet has
she so fresh and gallant a color, yt to behold her well, I cannot compare her
better then unto the bark of those great Elmes we commonly find along the high
ways as we ride in great Brittaigne, her hair is as white as snow, and for
want of combing all knotted together, which sets her out so well, yt to
behold it spread abroad upon a bears skin (which she wears for a gown,) there
is not any man living yt would not be surprised with a sudden and vehement
love, in ye beholding of her Vrganda yt had heard of her before, and above all
things was much desirous to see her, because of her great skill, said unto
Esplandian: In good faith I know her better then you think I do, and am well
assured, yt in her young years she has been one of the goodliest ladies yt ever
you saw. For she is both daughter, sister, and aunt unto a king and is called
Melie, who for to learn ye perfect art and science of Nigromancy, has so much
contemned the world, yt for her inheritance she has chosen a rock, wherein
she has caused a cave to be dug, where she now remains and lives in
great misery, and I swear unto you of my faith, yt it is above twenty years
and more since I determined to come and see her, but other affairs yt touched
me nearer, have still hindered my desire. Madame (said Esplandian) seeing you
are so near, you may do it now, and all we will be your guides. I pray you let
it be so (said she) and let us go as soon as we have dined: which done, and the
tables uncovered, every man made preparation to go with Vrganda to behold yt
sight: but Esplandian would have but threescore with him, who being well horsed
and armed at al poinis, issued out of Galatia, Vrganda on her palfrey, riding
among the^, Belleris was their guide, and when they came near unto the cave
where they had found Melie, they espied her set crosse-legged upon the point of
a rock, with that Vrganda prayed them to stay, that she alone might speak
secretly unto her, which the knights agreed unto. Wherewith she rode forward,
and being near unto her, she said: Madame, I pray you be not offended that I
come to see you, and offer you my service. Who are you? (said she) I am (said
she) Vrganda la discogneue, yt have always had a great desire to see you. Ha
Vrganda, the wisest lady among all others (said Melie) your coming hither
pleases me right well, light down I pray you, that you and I may talk of
such things as we have taken great pains to learn and understand: for
although you have been the only occasion of the Christians arrival here,
whereby our poor country indureth so much woe, yet I cannot but excuse you,
knowing the faith and duty you are bound to show to your religion. Wherefore I
pray you come near, and sit down by me. Vrganda perceiving her to be so old
and feeble, did as she required, hoping by force to stay her there whether she
would or no, till her company were come thither, minding to give her unto them
to bring her to Galatia, but she met with as crafty a mate as her self, for
the old woman perceauing Vrganda to be near her, went to the mouth of her
cave, and said unto her: Vrganda, It would grieve me that these Knights should
hear our talk, wherefore let us go in. Whereat Vrganda made no difficulty,
thinking verily, that if she might once lay hands on her, she would use her at
her pleasure: wherewith she followed her, but she was no sooner entered, but
Melie stepped to her and held her so straight by ye throat, yt she had no
means to call Esplandian or any of the rest to help her. But they fearing the
worst, ran in all have unto the cave, and the first that entered was Talanque,
and after him Manely, and they had no sooner stepped in, but they fell down as
if they had been dead, and their fall was so great, that Esplandian that
followed them heard it, but he had a remedy about him against all such
adventures, and that was his good sword, against the which no inchauntment
whatsoever could ought avail, which he first found to be true when he entered
into Arcabonnes chamber: he perceauing his two companions in such case, being
much grieved thereat, willingly would have relieved the^, but yt he spied Melie
holding Vrganda under her knee, seeking by all means to strangle her: which
caused him first to succor her, threatening Melie if yt she did her hurt, she
should deerly buy it, but for all his threatenings she ceased not to use all the
means she could for to destroy her, until Esplandian went near unto her,
and with his sword thought to cleave her head. wherewith she began to fly,
thinking to be safe within the chamber where she wrought her charms, but as
she stepped upon the threshold of the door, Esplandian caught her by the Bears
skin, and whether she would or not, held her so fast, that she could go no
further. And as he lifted up his arm to kill her, he remembered that he
should do wrong, thinking it not convenient for a Knight to defile his hands
in the blood of a simple woman, not able to resist: and surely yt thought of
his, moderated his color in such sort, that he purposed not to do it, minding
only to draw her out of the vaut: wherewith he took her by the hair, and
pulled her with all his force. With that he espied a great old Ape, with two
eyes burning like flaming fire, that lept upon him for to tear his flesh, but
he gave him such a blow with his fist between the eyes, that he struck him
dead. And passing forward, brought Melie out of her cave, and leaving her in
Frandalos keeping, went in again to see if Vrganda were alive, where he found
her in such pain, that it seemed the soul would depart out of her body, whereat
he had so great pity, that he took her in his arms, and set her in the
air, the like he did to Talanque and Manely, who within one quarter of an
hour after, could not call to mind what had happened unto the^, but were as
whole and as well as ever they were before. Wherefore they mounted on their
horses, taking Melie with them that sat upon Sergils horse, and he behind her,
holding her in his arms, least she should escape. And God knows with what joy
Vrganda showed them what fear she had been in, which as she said was such, that
she thought verily to die. But (said she) even as one nail drives out
another, so the joy I have of my delivery, makes me in a manner to forget the
pain wherein I was. And with that they entered into the Town, being almost
night.

CHAP. XL. How Carmelle arrived at Tesisante, and spoke with Heliaxe, and of
the marvelous combat which Esplandian, Frandalo, Gandalin, and Enil fought
against three Giants and twelve Turkish knights.
CArmelle traveled so long with the women and children of Galatia, that they
arrived at Tesifant, where they found both their fathers and husbands as many
of them as had saved themselves, as it is said before. Esteem I pray you what
grief they had to think upon their exile, and loss of all their goods:
Surely there is no heart so hard, but would have wept with grief to behold
great numbers of men and women, with diverse little children about them, and not
having any means to give them bread or drink. Whereof the Prince Alphorax
having news, and hearing of their sorrow, could not refrain to say in presence
of them all. Ah immortal gods, it must needs be, that either for some great
sin of me or mine, this cruel war is moved in my country: O gods
immortal, let your wrathes appease, and of your infinite goodness let it rather
please you that all the mischief which you send upon those impotent people
fall only upon me that alone have moved your indignations: if not, then I
beseech you give me grace, that to your glory I may drive these cursed
Christians (enemies of your holy laws) out of my country, swearing unto you,
that if you vouchsafe your aides, I will make so great a slaughter of them,
that thereby your wrathes shall be appeased, if it be so that the small
endeavor I have hither to used to drive them hence be the occasion of your
anger toward me. Then he asked them how they got away. My Lord (said he that
brought him news) a fair gentle woman named Carmelle (as I hear say) has
brought them hither, and desires to speak with you and the princess Heliaxe.
Lady (said Alphorax to his wife, do you know her? I my lord (said Heliaxe)
for she bare me company all that day that I fell into Frandalos hands, being
very ready to do me all the pleasure and service that she could devise:
wherefore my lord, I pray you let her have that honor and entertainment she
deserves. Lady (said Alphorax) I am well content therewith. With that some of
them ran to fetch Carmelle, who being come in presence of Alphorax, went
presently unto the Princess Heliaxe, and without salutation, said unto her:
madame, you know the lord and master that I serve, who only has aucthority
over me, think it not therefore strange, if in any sort I have not humbled my
self before the prince Alphorax or to you: And to the end Madame, that you
should know the cause of my arrival here, I think the taking of Galatia is
not unknown unto you, whereof at this present the Christians are Lords and
masters, having conquered it from you by force, not finding any Garrison
therein, but a number of women and little children: which my lord Esplandian
and his company send unto your grace, committing them unto your good
discretion. Assuring you (their Religion only excepted) they are ready to do
you any service that they may. Carmelle (said the Princess) this is not the
first favor they have showed unto me, I am of long time so much beholding to
them, that be it in their adversities or their prosperities, I will never be
unmindful of the same. Nevertheless, I am assured, that at this day I have
not, neither yet shall ever have the means to do it, (as I think) unless
that variable fortune turn her rouling wheel, and abase them as much as now
they are advanced, then (if it so fall out) they shall full well perceive,
how much I esteem their virtues and favors they have shown unto me.
Carmelle (said Alphorax) have they willed you to deliver no message unto me?
No my lord (said she) but I tell you plain, they are determined very
shortly to come and visit you, in such manner, as will not greatly like you.
By all my gods (said Alphorax) I will ease them of that burden, if they make
not the more have. For I have so many men preparing, that I mean to go in
person to Constantinople to destroy the wicked Emperor and all the
Christians. Then shall my wife have means (if she think good) to acknowledge
the favors toward them, which they have showen unto her, as she says. My
lord (said Carmelle) Men's enterprises do oftentimes fall out contrary to
their expectations, and God that is in Heaven above, commands and disposes
of all things as it pleases him, and not as we would have it. Now Madame
(said she to Heliaxe) I have done the commandment of those that sent me
hither, wherefore I beseech you let me be safely conducted to the place from
whence I came. My lord (said the princess to Alphorax) I pray you show her so
much favor, for it would grieve me much that she should receive the least
injury in the world, which he granted unto her: and withal Heliaxe gave her
for her pains one of the richest gowns she had. Wherewith she caused her to
be conducted by twenty knights unto the Town of Galatia: where being arrived,
she showed them what she had done, as also what speeches the Prince Alphorax
used unto her, which Vrganda marked well, saying unto the Knights: In faith my
good friends, as touching Alphorax high words, they are the fruits of his
nature, being altogether proud and arrogant: Nevertheless, I can assure you,
that fortune promises him great matters. And because it will not be long
before they do happen, I will now use no words of them: Praying some of you
to show me so much favor to return again unto Melies cave, to fetch her
Books that we left behind us. Which being in my possession, it may be they
will serve hereafter to do both you and many others pleasure. Esplandian
hearing Vrganda speak with such affection, and knowing the desire she had to
have the books, answered her and said: Madame, before I sleep I will see if
I can fulfill your pleasure. And without longer staying, he desired Enil,
Frandalo, and Gandalin, to bear him company: who presently armed themselves,
and being on horseback without any other company then their own Squires,
issued out of the Town, leaving Vrganda with Norandel, that was newly come
from the city of Alfarin. The four knights rode so long till they came unto
Melies rock, where not far from thence they found three giants and twelve
knights, that with a loud voice stood at the mouth of the cave calling Melie,
for the shepherds keeping sheep in the fields (having seen her led unto
Galatia) ran to tell them news: and to know the truth they were expressly
come thither. Esplandian and his company knew them well to be their enemies,
wherefore they determined to give them battle although their number was far
greater: wherefore being covered with their ^hields, and their swords ready in
their hands, they entered among them, Esplandian met the first giant, Frandalo
the second, and Gandalin and Enil the third: and Esplandian gave his giant so
great a blow, that therewith he made him take so great a leap, that both
master and horse lay upon the ground not once remoouing han^ or foot. But it
fell out otherwise with the rest, for they having broken their spears upon
Frandalo, Gandalin, and Enil, their horses being loosely bridled, bare them at
least a mile from thence, before they could make them stay. With that the four
Christian knights were enclosed by twelve Turks, whereof three of them at ^^e
first charge were stricken dead unto the ground: wherewith ^^e fight began to
be most perilous and fierce, in such sort, that before the two giants could
return again, five other of the Turks were in such case, that the best of
them was hurt to death, so there rested but four: which Esplandian and Frandalo
left fighting with Gandalin and Enil, to meet the two giants that in great
have came toward them to help their companions: and as they met together
never was there brauer fight, for Esplandian thinking upon the princes
Leonorine, gave not one blow but he made the blood to follow on him that had
the stroke: whereby the rock became all bloody, yet he found his enemy no
less able to requite his blows, so that in short space his shield was so
hewed and cut in pieces, that there rested nothing but the lethers in his
hands: whereat he was in such a rage, that rising in his stirrops, he gave his
enemy so great a blow upon the coife of steel, that he struck it off,
wherewith the giants eyes started in his head, which made him bow his neck
upon the horses maine, and withal let fall his sword. With that Esplandian
struck him such another blow between the neck and shoulders that he cut off
his head: wherewith the horse ran up and down the fields with his dead Giant
on his back: mean time Frandalo handled the other Giant in such sort, that
he had put him out of breath. Gandalin and Enil for their parts doing no
less, for they two fighting against four, behaved themselves so courageously,
that they slew two of their hardiest enemies: yet the other two would never
yield, although they were still ready to flee, especially when they perceived
Esplandian coming toward them. And to say truth, it was not possible for
them to make any resistance: yet he stayed a while, because he perceived some
of them that were stricken down to rise again, and take their swords in
hand: whereat he turned about, but it chanced that his horses foot lighting
between a cliffe stuck fast, and was f^^ced to fall down, whereby Esplandian
was in the greatest danger of death that ever he had, by reason that his
ene^^es were on all sid^s about him ready to thrust their swords into his
^elly: a thing ^erie easy to be done if God had not provided f^^ h^^, and
given strength and agilitie to his horse to rise again with his master on his
back: who perceiving himself at liberty, and having his sword in hand, made
such execution on the Turks, that he left not one alive: wherewith those two
that fought with Gandalin and Enil fled along the mountain, as if all the
devils in hell had been behind them, and not being pursued saved themselves,
leaving the Giant behind them for a pawn, to whom Frandalo granted life,
not only because he asked mercy, but for that he was in a manner dead.

CHAP. XLI. How Esplandian entered into Melies cave, to fetch her books, and of
an assault made upon him, Frandalo, Enil, and Gandalin, as they thought to
return again unto Galatia.
THe combat ended as you heard before, each man caused his wounds to be dressed
and bound up in the best manner they could: then Esplandian entered into Melies
cave to fetch the books he sought, where he went into a fair chamber being
four square, about the which there grew so much Iuie, that it might verily be
judged to have been placed there for the hangings of the chamber: in this
chamber at each corner there hung four lamps, that burnt both night and day
and never went forth, so cunningly could the Enchantresse show her Art in tha^
place: and as Esplandian looked well about him, he espied the (...) of another
chamber, in the middle whereof stood a great candlestick all of massy gold
with seven branches, and in every branch a wax candle that burned continually:
hard by it stood a Cypres table, whereon lay Melies books, some covered with
plates of gold and graven upon it, others with silver, bound and embossed round
about, which Esplandian took and carried with him out of the cave, giving them
to keep unto his squire, and mounting on their horses, they rode the same way
they came, thinking presently to be at Galatia again. But they were stayed
sooner than they looked for, for the Turks that fled away (as you heard
before) made an alarm at a little town not far from thence, whereby there
issued twenty horse and forty footmen, who being assured that four knights
only and no more had overthrown their men, made all the speed they could to
enclose them, specially those that were well horsed: Frandalo and his company
perceived them a far off yet could they hardly shun them, but of force must
fight, or else endure the shame to fly away. Wherefore Esplandian was in mind
to try their fortune, and to send one of their squires in all have unto
Galatia, to advertise them of the danger they were in, that they might succor
them: whereto Frandalo would not give consent, showing what great pain and
travail both they and their horses have endured all that day, as also the
great number of their enemies in regard of them, in such sort (said he) that if
we take upon us for to fight with them, I am in doubt, that thinking to win
honor, we shall be counted rash and presumptuous fools. What then? (said
Esplandian) will you endure the shame to fly away? In good truth (said he) for
my part I had rather endure the hazard of life or death, what ever shall
happen. Then we will do thus (said Frandalo:) my squire shall run unto
Galatia to advertise Talanque and the rest how we stayed behind. Mean time, I
know a bridge not far from hence, whether we will go and defend the same,
till our aid shall come, where we cannot be assailed by them all at once:
otherwise think with your self what means we have to resist so many men both
on horse and foot, that come purposely to assail us. Let us go then (said
Esplandian) wherewith leaving the way on the right hand, they turned to the
left, as Frandalo led them: and they had not ridden very far but they came
unto a little river somewhat deep, over the which there stood a bridge, where
they had no sooner arrived, but they were presently charged by their enemies,
especially by one of the Turks that was most brave and sumptuous, and best
mounted of them all, as being their captain: who bearing a great lance in
his hand, began to cry most vehemently in the Arabian tongue unto Esplandian
and his companions, saying: You dogs, you fly away, but by our gods it shall
cost you all your lives: wherewith Enil that heard his threatenings better than
the rest, turned his face, and set spurs to his horse, the Turk and he
meeting so fiercely together, that Enil was hurt in the right arm, and the
Turk thrust clean through the body, wherewith he fell presently stark dead
unto the ground: Which set his companions in such a rage to see their champion
thus suddenly slain, that they thought to enclose Enil, but he found means to
recover the bridge: surely whosoever had seen the great prowess of those four
champions, might with good reason esteem them as they were, specially
Esplandian that stroke not one blow in vain. And although they were but few
in comparison of their enemies, yet they did twice or thrice overthrow diverse
of the Turks that seemed boldest to adventure forward, in such sort, that had
it not been for the footmen that came upon them, the horsemen had but little
prevailed: whereat it is not to be maruailed, because the greatest part of them
were citizens, altogether inexpert in arms, and fitter to banquet at a table
than to guide a horse or break a lance: whereby in less than a quarter of an
hour the four knights had done them great hurt: and so much, that neither
the horsemen nor footmen durst once set forward to enter upon the bridge, till
one of them determined to make proof, thereby if it were possible to enclose
them round about. This Turks name was Tluacam, a valiant and hardy knight, as
he well showed before the combat ended: for although the water was deep and
the other side hard to clime up, yet he waded through, and at diverse times bare
eight more of his companions over: which Frandalo and the rest perceiving, they
were constrained to divide themselves, Esplandian and Enil staying at the end
of the Bridge where the combat first began, Frandalo and Gandalin standing at
the other, and God knows what trouble they had, for Tluacam desirous to win
honor or to loose his life, with his lance in hand, charged Gandalin in such
sort, that both man and horse had like to fallen to the ground, and withal he
brake his spear: wherefore taking his sword in hand, striking on both sides,
and thinking to be seconded by his fellows, put his horse in such a fury, that
whether he would or not he bare him to ye middle of the bridge: where thinking
to stay, the horses feet slid from him, whereby both he and his master fell
into the river and were drowned: whereat the Turks gave so great a cry, that
they seemed mad, and bowing down their heads thinking to acquit their
loss, used all the force they could on both sides the bridge to enter upon the
four knights: who sustained their assault so bravely, that the Turks at last
were forced to recule, whereof nine were thrown into the water, but Esplandian
and his company were so weary, that in a manner they could fight no longer.
With that they perceived their aid in all have coming toward them: the
occasion why they stayed so long was because Frenace, Frandalos squire, that
went to seek Manely and the rest, thinking to find his master where he left
him, had led them thither, but not finding them there, supposed them to be gone
unto the bridge: and to say truth, they arrived in very good time, for that
Esplandian and his three companions were almost clean out of breath: but when
they perceived their aid, never did poor prisoners that were set at liberty
more rejoice, nor were better pleased: and the Turks on the contrary side
never more astonished, yet they held close together, determining rather to
revenge their deaths than once to yield unto their enemies: so that before the
Knights of Galatia could enter in among them, they gave them much to do,
although in the end they overcame them, whereby not one escaped alive, to carry
news unto their friends. Enil at the first onset had been sore wounded, as you
heard before, wherefore he caused his wounds to be searched: the like did the
rest of the hurt knights. Which done, they set forward to Galatia, contenting
themselves for that day with the victory it had pleased God to send them. And
coming to the gate, they found Vrganda ready to receive them: who knowing how
all had past, and the danger wherein Esplandian had been, iestingly said unto
him: In faith my Lord, said she, if I were afraid of death when I fell into
Melies hands, I believe you were not in much better case since that I saw you
last, as I understand by those that know what dommage you were in. Madame (said
he) I know I am a mortal man, and that my life and death are in the hands of
God, as it pleases him to dispose, and I confess unto you, if we had not
been succored, that in the end we could not have endured: yet am I well
assured, that before it had come to pass, we had laid so many enemies on the
ground, that the rest should have had greater cause to lament their loss, than
boast of their conquest. Vrganda perceived by Esplandians words that he liked
not her speech, whereupon she said unto him: My Lord, pardon me I beseech you,
and excuse the indiscretion of a woman, specially in me, who at this present
had forgotten my self. Madame (said Esplandian) you may command me, and
likewise set me forth for a coward, hardy, or any other what it pleases you to
term me. In which manner talking together, they came unto his lodging, where
master Elizabeth (newly come from Alfarin) visited his wounds, and the rest
likewise that had cause to use his help.

CHAP. XLII. How the Knights of great Britain that were at Galatia embarked
themselves with Vrganda in the great serpent, to sail unto Constantinople, and
what happened unto them.
THe Knights that had been hurt at the last encounter, for the space of
fifteen days after were forced to keep their chambers until their wounds
were healed: during which time, Vrganda took great pleasure in reading Melies
books which Esplandian caused to be brought unto her: wherein she found such
wonderful coniurations and devises of Magic Art, that she was abashed how
she that had had them so long time in her possession, knew no more than yet
she did, esteeming the Enchantresse Lady to have been the perfectest scholar
that ever studied in that art, as it well appeared by her books. Now the time
approached wherein it was expedient (according to the destinies appointed) that
Esplandian and his companions should go unto Constantinople: wherefore as
soon as their wounds were healed, Vrganda caused them to be assembled, and
standing in the midst of them all, she said unto them: My good friends,
knowing part of the prosperities and adversities which the heavens foreshewe
unto you all, I came hither specially to see Esplandian and you, of whom I
have received great pleat pleasure, perceiving at my arrival the love and
amity that is among you, with the great desire you have to accomplish the
order of knighthood: not for the glory and recompense of this world, but only
for the increasing of our faith and the service of God, that shall reward you
for it: and to the end you may continue in this forwardnes, and that the thing
which I pretend, may happily fall out, I will from henceforth not only employ
my person but my Art, which has pleased God to lend me, wherewith I will
advise you what I shall find convenient and necessary for the augmentation of
your honors already spread throughout the world: which to begin I am of
opinion, that you all imbarke your selves with me in the great serpent, that
shall bring us unto Constantinople to the Emperor, for without him it is
impossible that this great enterprise you have taken in hand can come to good
effect: as also that he himself before many years are past, shall be found
in marvelous necessity, and such, that he shall account himself most happy
to have your aid: and with good reason, for that in the end both he and you
shall overcome those hazzards according to your desires. Then shall you
plainly know, that this that I foreshew unto you is most true. While Vrganda
used these words, all the company stood still intentive for to hear her: and
had it not been that they esteemed her words to be most true, they had doubted
of the threatenings she used against the Emperor, he being so great and
puissant a Monarch. Nevertheless the issue of that trouble which she assured
unto them, gave them some ease and contentation of mind: in expectation
whereof, they made account in the mean time to prove their strengths and
forces, that thereby their valor and magnanimity might be further spread
abroad. And as touching their voyage to the Emperor, as Vrganda gave them
direction, it was only the thing whereunto Esplandian did aspire, hoping that
if the wars were openly proclaimed in the Grecian Empire, and the Emperors
danger so imminent, to show such valor and prowess in martial exploits,
that he would not only free and acquit his father of the promise he had made
to serve the Ladies, but confirm the love that the princes Leonorine bare unto
him, in such sort, that he might obtain her for his wife: which caused him to
speak for all his company, assuring Vrganda that not one of them but was
ready to obey and go where it pleased her. My friends (said she) then I pray
you to morrow in the morning cause your horses to be shipped in my ship, and
for armor take you no care, I will provide you thereof so well, that each man
shall find himself content: let it suffice you to imbarke your selves and set
sail: for often times an enterprise deferred over long, falls not out as me^
desire it should, not for want of good and wise counsel, but by the negligence
of those that are appointed to execute the same. Thus was their voyage to
Constantinople agreed upon, in such sort, that all the knights of great
Britain entered into the great serpent, taking with them Frandalo, Melie, and
the captain of Tesifant that had been taken prisoner, as you heard before,
leaving the Admirals soldiers for garrison in the town. Which done, the ship
went forward of it self, sailing toward the castle La montaigne defendu,
where being arrived they took Armato king of Turkey and his two captains with
them: for Vrganda willed them so to do: and six days after, the great
serpent arrived within half a mile of Constantinople, where she stayed. Then
Vrganda caused her Knights to be armed with the armor she had brought, which
were white, with a red cross both before and behind, most comely to behold.
They were in all forty knights, whose names are as follows: Esplandian,
Frandalo, Norandel, Talanque, Manely the wise, Ambor of Gandel, Grauate of the
fearful valley, Gandalin, Enil, Trion cousin to queen Briolanie, Brauor son
of the giant Balan, Belleris, Elion le delibere, Licoran of the white Tower,
Listoran of the silver bridge, Landin of Sariaque, Imosil of Burgondie,
Ledadrin of Ferraque, Sarquiles cousin to Angriotes, Palomir, Branfil, Tantiles
the proud, Galbron son of Isamel, Carpin his brother, Carin of Carante,
Attalio son of Oliuas, Bracele son of Bandoyuas, Garamante son of
Norgales, Amphinio of Almain, Brandonie of France, Penatrie of Spain, Flamene
his brother, Culspicio of Bohemia, Amandario of little Britain, Siluester of
Hungaria, Manely of Swethland, Galfarie of Italy, Galiot of Scotland,
Amandalie his brother, and Calfeur the glorious. Being arrived, the ship was
presently espied by the citizens which they knew, having seen it before when
it put them in such fear, as you have heard, but hoping for him that used
ordinarily to sail therein, they all ran unto the walls, and along the
shore to see him land: wherewith the noise and rumor was so great, that the
Emperor had news thereof being as then talking with the ladies. Those news
pleased the Princes Leonorine so well, that she no sooner heard the great
serpent named, but she rose up and went unto the windows to see if she could
epsy her love Esplandian: but the ship was somewhat too far off, neither did
it move from the place whereas it lay. Wherefore fearing to be deceived as she
had been before, she began to change color: which Queen Minoresse perceived,
and jesting said unto her: Madame, do you make this pitiful countenance to
dissemble the joy you have conceived, or for fear I should beguile you of him
that comes to see you? How now cousin (said she) how long have you learned to
mock? In faith I never thought upon the first of those two points, and much
less am I in doubt of the second, for you know as much as my self, and yet I
am not ignorant that when the great serpent was there where I now behold it, he
whom we expect came not thither, wherefore I fear (and with good reason) that
we shall now be served in like sort: and as she ended her speech, the ship
came within a bow shot of the haven where they might perceive one of her sides
to open, from whence they put out a boat, and not long after they saw Carmelle
and two other gentlewomen come forth, the two gentlewomen playing most sweetly
upon two instruments, which they did till they arrived at the shore: from
whence they went unto the Emperor, who knowing Carmelle, had better hope to see
Esplandian than ever he had before: and going unto her to ask what news, she
made no more reverence unto him than she used at other times to do, saying unto
him: My lord, Esplandian my master (that you so much desire to see) is now
arrived before the town in ye great serpent with diverse other knights his
friends and allies, and Vrganda la disogneue, desiring you to show them the
favor to stay in your palace, where they mean to come and visit your grace.
Truly Carmelle (said the Emperor) I never heard message in all my life that
pleased me so well, I am content to do as they desire, although I was determined
to meet them, and to give them that entertainment they deserve: But seeing
they will have it otherwise, I will satisfy their desires. That is sufficient
(said Carmelle) we will then return to them again, to certefie your graces
answer. Go (said the Emperor) and tell them from me, that they shall be most
heartily welcome. With that Carmelle with the two Gentlewomen departed toward
the Haven: mean time, whosoever had beheld the Princess Leonorine, might
easily have judged the alteration of her heart, it was so full of joy, that
without Queen Minoresse yt caused her to refrain, she would peradventure have
done done something whereby her honor had been blemished, minding to leave the
Empress her mother, and go to meet Esplandian, whose absence had procured so
great sorrow in her mind. But the Queen as a wise and discreet lady persuaded
her so much, that she stayed at the window, whereby her alteration might not
be perceived. Carmelle stayed not long, but went into the boat, rowing to the
great serpent, where being entered, there were presently two boats more put
forth, that brought horses to land, which don, they returned again to fetch the
knights, and those yt would went forth, and among them six gentlewomen, three
of the^ sounding ye recorders, the^ ceasing, the other three played on ye lute
and vials, in that manner being landed and mounted on their horses, they entered
into the City, ye six Gentlewomen marching first, after them ye two Turkish
captains yt were taken at ye siege of the castle La montaigne defendu, then ye
captain of Tesifant, next followed Armato, and with him ye princess Melie,
apparrelled in ye bears skin as she had been taken, then followed ye forty
knights two in a rank, armed horse and man in one sort of armor, in ye
midst of them road Vrganda, talking to Esplandian and ye king of Denmark.
And as they approached ye palace, ye Emperor* ye Empress, and the ladies met
the^, where ye emperor coming to Vrganda, did her as much honor as if she had been ye greatest queen in the world. Mean time the knights being among the
Ladies, gave occasion to be found no less courteous, then prompt and valiant
in arms, specially Esplandian, who coming to the princess Leonorine, kneeled
on the ground to kiss her hands, but she refused it, making ye whole company
believe, she was offended with him for delaying the time to come unto the court
as he had promised. Which the Emperor perceiving, could not refrain to smile,
and said unto her: How now daughter? Is this the good entertainment you show
unto your knight, and ye thanks you give him, for coming expressly hither to
serve you? I pray you call to mind, that he deserves a better countenance,
were it only for his fathers sake, to whom you are so much beholding. My lord
(said she) yt is ye cause I am so much offended with him, for if he resembled
ye knight with ye green sword as much in courtesy as in countenance, he had not
stayed so long to obey his fathers will, and to satisfy ye requests yt you and
I have made unto him by Carmelle and others, as your grace kneweth. Before God
(said ye emperor) you say true: yet I could never have been persuaded you would
conceive displeasure so long time, considring what he has done, and ye rich
presents he sent to you. My lord (said she) if he has done any thing for me,
it was without my commandment, I had rather he had done less in those things,
and yt he had been more obedient to his fathers will and mine. Madame (said ye
emperor to Vrganda) you see in my daughter how great ye choler of an angry
woman is. My lord (said she) she has reason so to do, for yt Esplandian
obeying his father, ought to confirm himself both to her will and yours. And
having failed therein, all he says yt he has done for her sake, may be
accounted nothing, although I am assured, yt the remembrance of my lady your
daughter has made him (being in fight) enter into such danger, that it was
most strange how he could escape. Wherefore Madame (said she to Leonorine)
he deserves pardon for the same, and so I pray you grant him. While Vrganda
spoke, ye Princes beheld Esplandian with so great affection, that in a manner
she lived and died in him: and he for his part by her felt in what sort love
uses those he holds in his power. Whereby she continued a long time without
answering Vrganda, not for any evil will to her in using of those speeches,
but rather feeling such alteration in her mind, that she trembled like a leaf.
But in the end she remembered her self, and said unto her: Madame, seeing it
is your pleasure that I remit his offense, I am content to do it, upon
condition, that if he forget himself as he has done heretofore, you shall
bear the punishment for him. With that she took him by the hand, and made him
rise up, changing speech, because the Empress (that in the mean time talked
with the king of Denmark) came thither, whereby Esplandian was constrained to
leave the Princess, and salute her. The emperor all that while had given no
entertainment to king Armato, as knowing him not, but when they showed him
which was he, he embraced him and said: My lord and brother, I beseech you
pardon my ignorance, in not entertaining you before this time, as not knowing
you, but I will amend the fault when you think good. My lord (said Armato) I
am now (as it pleases fortune) in place where you may command me, yet I pray
you call to mind who I was, and what I may be, and do for me as you would I
should do for you if your case were mine: Considering with your self, that the
like hard fortune may fall on you, and that it is no less virtue to intertain
the vanquished courteously, then to overthrow the puissant enemy. With that
the Emperor led him into his palace, the rest following after him, and when
they were in the hall, he left them with the Empress to speak unto Frandalo,
and taking him aside, said unto him: Frandalo, to let you know how well I do
account of the great good service you have done for me, I will that from
henceforth you shall be my chief standard bearer, in which place I now
establish you. For the which Frandalo thanked him most humbly, accounting
himself most happy to have so great authority.

CHAP. XLIII. How Norandel and Queen Minoresse fell in love one of the other,
and what conference they had together.
THe Emperor being among his Knights, making them all the cheer and honor
that he could devise. It happened that the Princess Leonorine and Queen
Minoresse seeing the king of Denmark and Norandel together, called Carmelle,
and asked her who they were. My Ladies (said she) you have seen him that has
the least beard here before, (which is the king of Denmark) for he came
hither with Frandalo, the other is Norandel king Luisarts son, esteemed for
one of the hardiest knights living on the earth. I pray you (said the
Princess) desire them to come hither, that we may speak with them. With that
Carmelle called them unto her, and as they were before the two Princesses, the
more they beheld the excellency of their beauties, the more they maruailed at
it, and not without cause, for next unto Leonorine there could hardly be found
in all Greece one that matched queen Minoresse, especially in comeliness and
good behavior, but if she had some perfection in her, nature had not
forgotten her self in forming the two knights, especially Norandel, who till
that time had never felt the stings of love, no more had Queen Minoresse.
Nevertheless, that little thief surprised them so covertly, that he bound
them both, making them captives one to the other, in such manner, that after
many Questions and Answers propounded they drew themselves apart, leaving the
king of Denmark talking with the Princess Leonorine, the Queen asking
Norandel what he thought of the Princess. Madame (said he) although I have
heard her esteemed for one of the goodliest ladies in ye world, yet did I never
think her beauty had been such as now I see it is, although you are little
behind her in that respect, whereby I might esteem my self most happy if I
had been asleep that day I enterprised to take my journey hither. Wherefore
(said the queen) have you had so ill intertainment in this court? No madame
(said he) but there is one has stolen that from me which I have most
carefully kept during my life. The Queen not knowing what he meant, was
thereat abashed, asking him what it was, and whether he knew the thief. I
madame (said he) and it rests in you to do me justice, if it be your
pleasure: for you and none other have that whereof I speak. In good faith
(said the Queen) you shall pardon me, for I have nothing of yours that I came
remember. Madame (said Norandel) since the time I first did know what
belonged to a man, I kept my liberty, not alienating it to any one: But coming
hither (I had no sooner set mine eye on you) but I found my self of a freeman
a bondslaue and captive to your ladyships good favor: which I beseech you before
me, in recompense of ye liberty you now have taken from me. Truly sir knight
(said she) you have at this present run too far astray, for if you beheld me
as you should, you had not found me such a one as you say, and would have been
twice advised to use such speeches as you do. Nevertheless, I will not take
them at your hands (being a stranger) in so evil part as mine honor does
require, and I think likewise you speak far otherwise then you mean: which
she said to undermine him, thereby to see if Norandels words were spoken from
the heart, who hearing that overthwart answer, was much astonished, but being
moved with love, answered her and said: Madame, pardon my boldness I beseech
you, but I swear unto you, by the faith of a knight, that I have discovered
the secret of my heart: and if you will not believe me at this time, I hope in
time to come to do so much, that you shall well perceive what great desire I
have to be your Knight, if it will please you to grant me so much favor to
accept me for the same. When Queen Minoresse perceived him so earnest, as
that in uttering those words he showed great affection, she esteemed in her
mind to have sufficient argument that might persuade her to believe his
words, wherewith she answered him and said: My lord Norandel, If you do as
you promise, I well believe that you say: and for the accepting you to be my
Knight, me thinks I should do wrong to refuse so small a favor to so
courteous a gentleman as you are: wherefore I both grant it and desire it of
you. With yt she took a little ring (she commonly wore) off from her finger,
giving it unto him for a witness of their new confirmed aliance: And had it
not ben yt ye Emperor was ready to go to supper, they had no sooner left
talking, but ye Empress went in, whereby queen Minoresse was constrained to
follow after, taking Melie and Carmelle with her, to whom she did al honor and
good intertainme^t she could devise: supper being don, and ye tables uncovered,
ye princes Leonorine yt had seen Norandel and queen Minoresse talking with so
great affection, doubted some feathers in ye wind, wherefore taking her aside,
said unto her: Cousin, I believe ye knight yt entertained you so long, told you
some news out of great Britain, or something else yt pleased you full well, I
pray you fair lady tell me what it was, for you were very earnest to harken
thereunto. How now madame? (said she) since when I pray you, did you learn to
mock? call you ye mocking (said she) which is don in earnest? I pray God ye
mockery I mean to you may fall out as I desire it would: the^ shall I at ye least
have as good advantage at you, as you have had at me, which would please me well,
not so much to have a co^panio^ in mine own estate, as to yield you in excha^ge
ye like pleasure I have received at your hands, when you first were made
acquainted with ye love between Esplandian and me. Wherefore fear not to utter
your mind unto me, otherwise I will from henceforth have you in a jealousy, for
that you have already done, or yet would do. Madame (said ye queen) rather
the^ you should do so, I will declare to you ye secretest thing I know. The
knight (said she) whereof you speak, (I know not by what means) has so captiued
my mind, yt I feel ye thing in my self which I never thought could have
happened to me. And as they yt are molested with a continual ague, do find ye
taste of water better the^ ye hope of life to the^: so I likewise, ye was
accustomed not only to co^temn the force of love, but blame al such as yield to
his might, (esteeming their estate rather voluntary then forcible) find my
self so much surprised, yt if God help me not, I am in the greatest danger yt
ever poor woman was. What (said the princess) think you my lord Norandel is
of so hard a heart, and little courtesy, as that he would disdain the love
of so fair and comely a Lady as you are? Do you perceive by him, that his
mind is placed elsewhere? No madame (said she) but to the contrary, he
protested to be wholly mine, without any further advantage, then that I have
accepted him for my knight. Truly (said Leonorine) I am glad thereof, and if
you had done otherwise, he might surely have complained, and you much more to
have refused so great a good, when it is offered without dissimulation: else if
it be otherwise, it is no good, but rather a curse. I am of this opinion
(said she) that my lord Norandel would rather die a thousand deaths then
bear that mind: Wherefore determine I pray you to use him well, assuring you,
that I will not fail to succor you in what I may, and will do for you as you
have done for me. So long they talked together, that the Emperor and his
company risen from the table, came to see the ladies. Nevertheless, neither
the Princess nor Queen Minoresse could have the means to entertain their
friends, but only with a look, whereby (their hearts panting in their
bellies) were some what eased: when night approaching, every man withdrewe him
to his rest, but when Queen Minoresse found her self alone, and in her bed,
she began to think upon the speeches that Norandel used unto her, sometimes
determining to assaie, if by any means she could drive the same out of her
mind, and then presently changed thoughts, and said unto her self: Alas, was
there ever greater constancy in a woman, then that I always had until this
time? Must I now of force yield up the fort, that against so many hard
assaults I held invincible? Alas, I now perceive it is of force, wherefore it
is better presently to seek for remedy, then to consume thus secretly as I
do. But what? if I chance in this sort to yield unto mine own desire, (poor
soul that I am) then do I manifestly perceive the danger wherein I fall, and
the thraldom that I bring my self into, from whence while I live, I shall
never escape. Wherefore it were far better for me to bridle mine own
affection, and command that which commands me, then do that which hereafter I
might repent. With that she held her peace, and tourning on each side, like
one not well at ease in body nor in mind, she had no sooner resolved one thing,
but presentlye dissolved it again, so great was her inconstancy therein.
Nevertheless, having well debated with her self all the pleasures or
displeasures that might cha^^e thereby: In the end, with a loud voice she
uttered these words: I know not what may come to pass, but Love promises me
great things: Wherefore if the worst fall out, and that from henceforth I
forget my self, he shall bear the blame, and not I, that will do nothing
but under his protection: In which opinion, she fell asleep, and the next day
Norandel and she finding means to talk together, they confirmed their love in
such sort, that they determined to use the same more by wisdom, then by
passion: which those that are in like case, ought to follow, thereby to attain
unto the point of their desired joys, which in times past before, was commonly
called the gracious gift of Mercy.

CHAP-XLIIII. How Vrganda declared unto the Emperor the signification of the
Prophecy that was found in the tomb, and of two dragons that carried her with
king Armato and Melie up into the air, and set them in the middle of the city
of Tesifant.
YOU heard before how Carmelle in her ship, showed the Emperor the tomb that
Esplandian had conquered in the Rock of the Enchauntresse with the image of
Jupiter, and the Prophecy he held within his hand, which the Emperor
remembered so well, that he never ceased to think thereon. Whereby, the next
day after the arrival of that noble company in the city of Constantinople, he
calling to mind that there could no person be found in all the world better
able to resolve his doubt, then Vrganda was, caused her to go into the closet,
where the Emperesse with the Princess Leonorine, Queen Minoresse, and no
more, stayed for her: they five being together, the Emperor caused the image of
Jupiter to be brought thither: which done, he said unto Vrganda: Madame, I pray
you do me so much pleasure as to declare (if it be possible) what are the
meaning of the letters that this Image holds. With that Vrganda read it, and
having considered thereof, she said unto the Emperor: My lord, the great
knowledge and skill that this Idol has fore showen shall in time to come be
lost, is already happened: for as you know, the power of Jupiter and of other
gods, has been suppressed and abolished by the coming of Jesus Christ: and as
touching these words, The bondslaue of the bond of slavery shall be buried
here, and life restored by him that suffered death. These are hard and obscure
terms, yet will I declare them to your Grace as well as possibly I may. With
that Leonorine and queen Minoresse thought she would have spoken of the knight
Esplandian that had been put into a Cedar chest, as you heard before: wherewith
they being surprised with a deadly fear, began to behold each other in most
pitiful manner: which Vrganda well perceiving, intending to ease their minds,
continued her discourse in this manner: My lord (said she) this prophecy was
written concerning Matrodo lord of the castle La montaigne defendu, who as you
know was always a Pagan till his latter day that he became a Christian,
whereby long time he continued a bondslaue of the bond of slavery: for such
ought the sea of Idolatry to be named: but Esplandian perceiving his
repentance, suffered him to be buried in the hermitage, where as yet Carmelles
father does remain: who since that time has so much honored the giants body,
that she has buried his bones within the Cedar chest, yt you madam (said she
to Leonorine) if you do remember, gave unto her: and touching these lines which
contain these words, That life shall be restored by him that suffered death:
that is likewise to be understood of him, for that loosing this transitory
life, he has obtained the eternal in Abraham's bosom: so great grace has he
received at ye hands of God by the merit of his sons passion, in whom he did
believe, as I said before: and so my lord (said she) you have heard what I can
say as touching this strange prophecy. I but (said the Emperor) what means
the rest? My lord (said she) I can tell you no more of it than can my lady your
daughter or queen Minoresse, but so much can I assure you, that in short time
you shall see it come to pass: and if in any point it concerns you, the best
is it will all fall out to greater good of your soul, than to any power or
worldly glory: wherewith for this present I pray you content your self. I truly
(said the Emperor) and so will I always do: for so my soul be well I esteem
not the misery of torments of my body. And with that he left Vrganda with the
Empress, and went into the hall, where great number of knights and gentlemen
stayed for him: with whom he passed the rest of the day in all pleasant
delights: mean time fortune by little and little began to play her part, and
to spread the nets wherewith she meant to enclose that troop, thereby to work
the envy and great tribulations that afterward fell upon them: the beginning
whereof was such as you shall here. About a mile without the city, the Emperor
had built a sumptuous palace, called Vaelbeniatnof, as like to that of
Apollidon in ye firm Isle as well could be devised: which place was compassed
with a park furnished with all things requisite for man's delight, whither he
meant to lead the ladies, with Esplandian and his company, as also king
Armato, to feast them in the same, and for that purpose within three days
after their arrival, they departed from the city of Constantinople, and went
to Vaelbeniatnof, going into the park, wherein they found the hunters, and at
their first entrance a great Heart was singled out, which in the end after long
chase was killed almost before the ladies: and going further, they espied a
bore so fiercely hunted by dogs, yt they made him turn, and with his tuskes
stroke ye dogs, yt none durst set upon him: but at the last one of the hunters
struck him in the throat, and so he died: so long this sport endured, ye supper
time drew on, wherefore the lords and ladies entering into the palace found the
tables covered, and sitting down, were served in most sumptuous manner: and
having supped, they began to dance, which continued till midnight, minding ye
next day to begin their sport again: but fortune minding to bear a part, did
so trouble the feast yt she gave them well to understand, how she can work in
all things at her pleasure: for the next day about evening the knights and
ladies being in the Park, some talking with those to whom they bare affection,
and co^tenting their mind with such devises as love to pass the time in
pleasure, put into their heads, others running about and taking pleasure to
gather flowers, and do as most delighted them. Melie (from who^ till then they
could not hear one word) went unto Vrganda, and before them all spoke unto her
and said: Madame, I marvel (if it be so that your learning and skill be such
as is reported) why you make no sport unto this company. Melie (said Vrganda)
where you are present I will not undertake to do it before you, but you should
rather do it, being well assured, that the Emperor would be thankful for
the same. If it pleased him (said she) I am content, upon condition, that after
me you do the like, or better if you can. Truly (said the Emperor) it is but
reason: and I pray you both to do it. My lord (said Melie) then command
Vrganda to lend me a book that I was wont to have, whereon the picture of
Medea, (and her name written over it) does stand, then shall you behold some
of mine art, and if Vrganda never knew it before, she may learn it now of me.
In good faith (said Vrganda) that will I not deny you: with that she called one
of her Gentlewomen, willing her to fetch the book: mean time Melie took king
Armato by the hand, and making as though she would speak a word with him,
they walked a while together, then they sat them down hard by the place where
the empress and the ladies were talking with each other, and staying til the
thing Melie had requested, were brought thither, which not long after Vrgandas
Gentlewoman brought unto her, she having it in her hand opened the book, and
then began to read, making certain signs with her eyes lifted up to heaven
and calling Vrganda, prayed her to come thither, saying she should see yt she
never had seen before. Vrganda not doubting any treason by Melie prepared,
went and sat down by her, and next her king Armato, so that she sat between
Melie and him, where Melie began to turn the book, showing them certain
prophesies, and other strange devises, which continued not long but the air
began to be covered with a round black cloud, and there with it seemed so
dark, that they could not see each other, at the last the cloud opened, and
they beheld two horrible dragons coming down out of the cloud that drew a
wagon, and stayed right before Vrganda, who by Armato and Melie was so
straightly embraced, that whether she would or not they thurst her in, and they
after her. Wherewith the dragons seeing their wagon charged, flewe up into the
air, and carried them away, Vrganda crying for help, but all in vain: for in
less than the twinkling of an eye she was out of sight: wherewith there was
such noise among the company, that Esplandian, Talanque, Ambor, Manely, and the
rest of the knights that came thither with her, swear never to rest above one
night in a place before they found her out: so that the same day taking their
leaves, both of the Emperor and others that by them were left in sorrow, they
entered again into the great serpent, but before Esplandian went, he spoke unto
the princes Leonorine, beseeching her not to take in evil part his enterprise
taken in hand for the love of her, to whom he found him self so much
beholding, promising her that presently (having found Vrganda) he would
return again. My good friend (said she) me thinks you should do this at
better leysour, and not in so great have as now you do: yet am I well content
to do as pleases you: but forget not I pray you (said she) to return again
as you have promised. Which Esplandian vowed upon his faith: mean time
Norandel and queen Minoresse (as much grieved as might be) knew not what
countenance to hold, having their hearts so seized with care, that the Queen
was constrained to withdraw her self into her chamber, and lay upon her
bed, shutting the door: whereby Norandel had no means to take his leave,
but embarked himself, charged with an infinite number of greefes and sorrows:
with that the great serpent began of it self to set forward, and within two
days after arrived at the castle La montaigne defendu.

CHAP. XLV. How the two Dragons set Vrganda, Melie, and king Armato in the
middle of the city of Tesifant, and of the great army that Armato prepared
to enter into Greece.
THe Dragons bearing Vrganda, Melie, and king Armato in the air, flewe so
swiftly, that before day they were right over the city of Tesifante, where
they set down their charge: that done, they flewe away, and never were seen
again: king Armato was exceeding glad when he perceived himself to be in
place whereas he might command, and went unto his palace, where finding the
guard, he made himself known unto them, that presently went to advertise the
prince Alphorax, who much abashed at those news, start out of his bed, and
casting a furred gown upon his shoulders, ran to embrace his father, who
seemed to be so changed, not only because his beard was longer than he used,
but by reason of the great grief and melancholy he had so long endured, that
the prince began to weep, and say unto him: My Lord, you are more than
heartily welcome, for Gods cause I beseech you tell us how fortune has been
so much your friend to deliver you out of the misery wherein you have continued
so long, to my no little grief. Son (said he) Melie can tell you better than
my self, for she is the only means of my good hap, and has brought with her
Vrganda discogneue, (of whom heretofore you have heard.) And as he left
speaking, Melie and Vrganda entered into the hall, wherewith the rumor of the
kings return was so great within the City, that all the people ran unto the
palace for to see him, being as glad of his arrival, as Vrganda sorry to see
her self in such a place, and that which grieved her more, was that Melie in
presence of them all, spoke unto her and said: Vrganda, two things move me to
save thy life: the one, for that in my captivity thou have not once suffered
an evil word to be used to me, neither permitted that any man should do me
harm: the other because I certainly know that king Armato has by thy means
received all the good intertainement he had, during his hard imprisonment.
Nevertheless, the mischief thou have procured unto this country (being the
only cause the Christians entered into the same) is sufficient to make thee
endure perpetual imprisonment: wherein by mine art I will so straightly
enclose thee, that thy Art shall naught avail thee ever so get forth. But
although that sentence might well abash Vrganda, yet she showed such
constancy, yt she never changed color, determining with her self to endure
whatsoever should fall out, wherefore she said unto Melie: Madame, you may do
with me as pleases you, but in reason you ought not to use me otherwise then
you your self were used when I had the like authority over you, as you have
now of me, otherwise you shall do wrong both to your self and me: To me, yt am
old and ancient, putting me in prison, wherewith you threaten me, (not having
offended you,) and to your self, in preferring cruelty before the courtesy yt
has been found in you: whereto Melie answered her not a word, but commanded her
to be shut into a great tower standing in the midst of ye city, over ye which
she wrought such coniurations, ye Vrganda knew without Gods help, it would be
impossible for her ever to come forth: yet she lived in hope, considring ye
mutability of fortune, and ye king Armato himself had been casually delivered,
who continued certain days in his great City of Tesifant, without making any
show to be revenged. But in the end he sent Ambassadors to all the Princes in
the East yt were his allies and confederates, desiring them to enter into arms,
not only to drive the Christians out of Galatia, Alfarin, and other places
that they had usurped in his country, but to destroy Constantinople with all
the Christian monarch, and therefore wrote a letter unto them, the contents
whereof do follow.

Armato, by the providence of our immortal gods, called to the government of
the puissant country of Turkey, the frontier and Bulwark of al ye Pagan land, to
all caitifes, kings, soldiors, admirals and governors of ye countries situated
in ye east parts, se^deth greeting, being returned out of prison, from whence
we are now delivered, I thought good to give you to understand, that not long
since there is a knight come out of the South into the marches, descended (as
men say) of the race of Brutus the Troiane, to whom for our injustice (as it
is very likely) our gods have given power to conquer the castle La montaigne
defendu, slaying Matroco and Frerion, two of the best Knights in all the East
parts: and which is worse (the number of the Christians increasing more and
more) they have fought all means to destroy our holy law: which to prevent,
we entered into arms, and having raised a mighty army, thought to drive them
out of our quarters: but having long time continued siege before the castle La
montaigne defendu, and brought it to such extremity, that they had no victuals
to sustain themselves, he of whom we were most in doubt, the first beginner
of those wars, found means by the aid of a villain named Frandalo (that
sometime belonged unto us) to enter therein, and by subtlety to take us
prisoners, in such sort, that our army being overthrown, we remained prisoners
in their hands, where they have holden us in straight keeping almost for the
space of a whole year together: mean time our fortune continuing worse and
worse, they have by treason seized upon the towns of Alfarin and Galatia, two
of the best ports in all our Realm: which they had never taken in hand
without the aid of the traitorous and disloyal Emperor of Constantinople:
who for to aid and succor them, has falsely broken the truce concluded between
us, and raised so many men, that without your aides, we are in danger to fall
into their hands, a thing that would concern you much, seeing we (as you know)
are the frontire and rampart to you all. Wherefore in the name of all our gods,
we pray and desire you, that not only for the safeguard of our law, but for
the profit and utility of all the East countries, you will assemble your
forces in so great number, that thereby we may drive these Christians out of
our country, and conquer the Empire of Constantinople, even to France, and
the countries of great Britain, which will be both easy and profitable unto
us. These letters written and the messengers dispatched, they made such have,
yt before ye end of July following, there were so many men assembled at the
port of Tenedos, that the Christians had news thereof, as hereafter you shall
hear. One day among the rest as Belleris, Talanque, and Manely being issued
out of the castle La montaigne defendu, hoping to take some Turk in the way to
Tesifant that might tell them news, not only of king Armato, but of Melie and
Vrganda, as day began to appear came unto the aduenturous fountain, where they
beheld ye pillars of brass, ye pauillion, and ye field bed ye Heliaxe had left
there, with a great serpent lying therein, which presently began to run away,
and the knights after, thinking to kill her, but their horses durst not go
near her, yet she began to complain and weep as bitterly as a woman traveling
with child. Wherewith there appeared four men well mounted and armed at al points,
yt cried out and said: Sir knights, depart frem hence and trouble not our
gentlewoman in this sort, or it shall cost you your lives. And scarce had they
ended their speech, but they ran each at other, ye strange knights breaking
their spears in such manner upon the Christians, ye Manely and his companions
thought they had run against the^ with long strawes. Yet could not one of the^
couch his lance, but ran their course without once touching the^. Mean time,
the serpent entered into a hole, and could no more be seen, and as they turned
their horses to run another course, the four knights would not abide, but
flying away, cried unto them and said: Sir knights, our Gentlewoman is safe,
for ye rest content your selves if you think good. Get you hence to all the
devils (said Talanque) and ill fortune might he have yt follows after you.
With yt they three returned unto the fountain, not without great laughing at
their adventure. And as they were before the pauillion, they perceived a knight
that watered his horse, to who^ Belleris riding, asked him his name: What have
you to do therewith? (said he.) So much (said Belleris) that either you shall
tell me presently with good will, or else shall sight with me. You shall fail in the
one, but not in the other: for although you be three, yet am I well content to
prove what the knights of great Britain can do. When Talanque heard him
speak so boldly, he could not refrain to say: By God sir knight, that shall
you prove without delay, and setting spurs to his horse, ran fiercely against
the other that refused him not, but struck him so sure, yt he overthrew him to
ye ground. Which Manely wondering at, set forward to revenge his friend: but if
ye first sped ill, he sped no better, no more did Belleris: all three rising up
again, ashamed at their falls, which minding to amend by dent of swords, the
other knight fled along the wood, crying so loud, that they might hear him
say: Sir knights, another time sit better on your horses, and trouble not your
selves to follow me, if you mean not to lose your way. In Gods name (said
Talanque) what may this mean, shall we have no better fortune all this day, I
think we are inchaunted. Let us mount upon our horses and follow after him,
that we may know whether God or all the devils in hell have determined to
cross us in this iourny. Wherewith they mounted, determining to follow after
ye other, but they heard a lamentable voice, wherefore they stayed to see what
it might be. With that they espied a woman with her head undressed, crying out
for help: And after her ran a lion ready to devour her: whereat they being
moved with compassion, thought to step between the^, but the lion began so
horribly to rore, yt the horses stricken with fear, bare their masters above
two long bows shot from thence: mean time, ye woman and the lion vanished
away, whereat Talanque and Manely more abashed then before, asked Belleris if
ever he heard of such adue^tures. In good faith (said he) those ye are
desirous to see strange things, must repair unto this fountain: For there are
many (and such as yet you have not seen) ye wonder it is to hear, and will you
know how it comes to pass? Melie had devised the^ long time since, wherefore
it is not to be marvelled. No more I do not (said Manely:) nevertheless, were
it not for ye enterprise we now have taken in hand, by the faith of a knight
(said he) I would not depart from hence before I had seen them all. That shall
be at another time (said Belleris:) let us now keep on our way, yt we be not
discovered. With yt they held on the left hand, always riding toward the city
of Tesifant: and having ridden about five miles space, they met ten men on
horseback all unarmed, leading two Gentlewomen, one of them being somewhat
fair and well apparelled. But the ten men were in so great fear, ye leaving
the Gentlewomen, they ran and saved themselves not being pursued, for the three
knights stayed with the gentlewomen, of whom they hoped to hear such news as they
desired. And in effect, after they had somewhat assured them, they asked them
what news of king Armato, and whether he were still prisoner. My lords (said the
eldest Gentlewoman) it is not long since he escaped out of the Christians
hands, and is returned unto Tesifant with Melie, that has shut Vrganda in a
tower, from whence she shall never depart without her leave. That is good news
for us then (said Belleris:) and what has king Armato done since his return?
Does he not (said he) mean to be revenged on them that kept him prisoner so
long? I truly (said she) for all the kings, Souldans, Cailiffes, and admirals
of the Pagan law, have promised him to arrive at Constantinople, and to destroy
all Christendom. And as it is said, the most part of them are already arrived
in the isle of Tenedos. In good faith said Belleris to his companions,)
considering the speeches of these Gentlewomen, I am of this opinion, that we
meddle no longer with them, but return unto our hold. Whereunto they both
agreed, and letting the Gentlewomen depart, made so great have, that about two
hours after sunnesetting they arrived at the castle La montaigne defendu,
where they showed their companions what adventures they found in the
aduenturous fountain. And at our departure from thence (said they) we found
ten men on horseback leading two Gentlewomen, by whom we have for certain
understood, that Vrganda is straightly shut up in one of the towers of
Tesifant, and so inchaunted therein by Melies coniurations, that she is like
never to come forth, as also that the Pagan kings assemble themselves together
in the isle of Tenedos, to ouerrun the Emperor of Constantinople, and all the
Christians country.

CHAP. XLVI. How the Pirate Crescelin, nephew to the admiral Tartary, brought
certain news to Esplandian of the great army that the lords of the east
parts prepared to come unto Constantinople.
THe report that Belleris, Talanque, and Manely, used to their companions as
touching the great preparation the Pagans made to invade the Empire of
Constantinople and all Christendom, caused them to think thereon, in such
sort, yt they took counsel to determine among themselves, whether it were
better for the^ to augment the garrisons of the castle La montaigne defendu,
Alfarin, and Galatia, or go to Constantinople to aid the Emperor. And as
they were in debating of the matter, Crescelin nephewe to the Admiral of
Greece, (that not long before had stolen ten Galleys from the Emperor to
roue upon the sea) came to advertise the Knights, that as he sailed into
Phrigia, he had discovered in the isle of Tenedos, so many Galleys, Foistes,
and other vessels, of the enemies, that the sea seemed covered therewith, who
without doubt assembled to ouerrun the Emperor and destroy all Christendom:
wherefore (said he) I thought to let you understand the same, not only because
you might provide for them, but also to desire your favors to entreat the
Emperor in my behalf: assuring you, that if he pardon the offense I have
committed against his majesty, I will from henceforth do him so good service,
that he shall like it well. My lord Cresceline (said Esplandian) I have
always heard ye emperor reported to be one of the best princes living in ye
world, and most easy to be appeased, when with reason men reconcile themselves
unto him: wherefore I am assured, yt if he know you mean faithfully to serve
him as you protest, yt he will not only forget your fault, but do you much more
good the^ to others of his me^: and the better to incite him thereunto, I am of
this opinion, that with your ships you presently return to the goulfe
Propontide, and there (if it be possible) shall find the means to take some
Turkish gally, thereby to know the truth of their intent: and if you will,
Belleris shall go with you, and according to your reports, we will determine
what were best for us to do, whereunto the pirat willingly condiscended: so
that the same day he put to sea, and with Belleris they coasted the country of
Thrace unto Solombre, where staying secretly at the entry of the goulfe, they
continued certain days to bring their enterprise to pass: mean time
Esplandian not being idle, and thinking upon the news that Crescelin brought,
was of advise that Frandalo and all the other knights of great Britain should
return to Constantinople to aid ye Emperor (which he desired them to do:) and
I (said he) with the king of Denmark, Gandalin, and Enil, with the garrison of
this place, will stay the return of those that are gone to Tenedos, and having
spoken with them, either we will remain here still, or presently follow you.
Esteem I pray you, if this opinion of Esplandian were liked of by Norandel,
for that from the day he left queen Minoresse, he had not shown a pleasant
countenance, but was so melancholy that every man wondered thereat: and
although the rest were not infected with the like disease, yet was there none
that started back, but all agreed to Esplandians mind: whereupon without long
delay, they embarked themselves with so good a wind, that the seventh day after
they arrived at Constantinople, whereof the Emperor being advertised was
exceeding glad, going to meet them at the haven: and having embraced them one
by one, not seeing Esplandian in their company, he asked where they left him:
with that the knights told him what intelligence they had received by
Crescelins means from out of Asia, the great danger prepared against him by the
kings of the East, how he and Belleris were returned to see the countenance of
the enemy, and to know more certain news: and lastly, what the occasion was
why Esplandian stayed behind in the castle La montaigne defendu, with the king
of Denmark, Gandalin and Enil. The Emperor hearing these news, was much
abashed, yet like a stout and valiant prince dissembled what he thought, and
not long after (minding to prevent all inconveniences) in all have caused
Constantinople and his other towns, places, and havens of the sea, to be
provided of victuals and munition as he thought meetest for them: mean time
sending forth his captains throughout all his Empire, to assemble men in all
places, that might be ready when occasion served. Thus did the Emperor take
care to provide for his affairs: and Norandel mean time to govern Minoresse,
who minding to try him like gold within the furnace, one day among the rest
showed him a harder countenance than usually she did, faining she had received
news that he loved a lady in great Britain: wherein Norandel by all means
sought to excuse himself: but the more he seemed constant, so much more did
the Queen make him believe she thought the worse of him: wherewith he was in
such perplexity, that he could not choose but say: In faith madame, as far
as I perceive, you mean to end my days, for the wrong you do me is so great,
that it can not well be judged but by such as know your cruelty: and yet the
affection I bear you is so great, that neither I nor any other can well
express the same, if presently they do not show the beauty and perfection
wherewith nature has adorned you. Wherefore estranging me from your wonted
favor, I perceive my life begin to shorten, wherewith I am not grieved, were
it not, that dying, I should loose the means to do you service, but not the
benefit of loyalty: for whether I live or die, the same shall still
accompany my soul unto the place of rest. Which words when Norandel had
uttered, the tears trickled down his cheeks. Whereat Queen Minoresse took
such pity, that forgetting her dissimulation, with a smiling countenance she
answered him and said: My good friend, I now believe you well, and therefore I
pray you pardon my indiscretion: for so it is, that this that I have done, has
been only to avoid the means that should procure you to attempt the same.
Now I well perceive your constancy (according to my counsel at your last
departure hence) remember I beseech you how necessary dissimulation is to such
as are infected with the like disease: I mean, it should not be between us
two, but before the world that they perceive it not. Madame (said Norandel) I
will not if I may offend your Grace, knowing mine own constancy so well, that
impossible it were for me to withdraw my love from you, as also not to serve
and honor you, yea though you should reward me with the greatest cruelties
that all such as love and are not loved, might endure. While they thus devised
together, the Princess Leonorine (that served them as a watch) entertained
Frandalo and the rest, and making as if she knew not the cause of Esplandians
return to Constantinople, she asked it of them, faining to be displeased at
the same, but they excused him: in like sort they did unto the emperor, as you
heard before.

CHAP. XLVII. How Crescelin and Belleris returned to the castle La montaigne
defendu, with a ship that they had taken from the Turks, by whom they
understood the enemies pretense.
NOt long after that Crescelin and Belleris departed from the castle La
montaign defendu, sailing as secretly as they could along the coast of Phrigia,
fortune favored them so well, that a Brigandine sailing to Tenedos, charged
with Turks, fell into their hands, whereof they left but four alive: by whom
they certainly understood, that the army of the Princes of the East was to
depart from thence within a month or six weeks after at the furthest, and
sail to Constantinople, which they hoped easily to surprise, having by their
espials had intelligence that the Emperor made no preparation to withstand
them. Which having heard, they returned without longer stay to give advise unto
Esplandian, who fearing that the Emperor would not be able to withstand their
might, determined to use the aid of all his feiendes, minding to send Gandalin
and Enil unto them, with letters to the same effect: specially to his uncle the
Emperor of Rome, to whom he wrote as follows.

My lord, the danger I see prepared against all Christendom, constrains me
to send this messenger unto you, by whom at large your Grace may understand
how great and puissant an army all the Kings and Potentates of the East
(enemies of our faith) have lately raised, by the persuasion of Armato king of
Turkey, therewith to overrun not only the Empire of Greece, but all the land
of Christendom, and wholly to extinguish our faith and holy law. And for that
all those of whom you hold the place, have always been the true defenders of
the Christian faith, as also that the case touches you so near, I am of this
advise (my lord) that you ought to spare neither money nor men, but to assemble
your forces in all have, and prepare your vessels to aid and succor the good
prince, who is the frontier (as you know) both unto you and all the potentates
that hold the law of Christ. I write the like unto the king my father, and to
the most part of all the Christian Lords, to whom I send Gandalin. And for
that Enil has in charge to certify your grace by word of mouth, what it shall
please you to demand, I will not trouble you with many lines, beseeching you to
give credit unto him, as to my self. The like he wrote to the king of
Sardaigne: which two messages Enil had in charge: to whom he gave ample
instructions and remembrances of all the aduertisements and secret
intelligences he had received from the Turkish coast: not only of the number
of men both on horse and foot; but also of the multitude of their vessels and
other warlike instruments: commanding Gandalin to go with him till he came
unto Cicilia, where he should provide shipping to sail into great Britain to
Amadis his father, and from thence to France unto king Perion, then to
Sobradise to Galaor, likewise to king Bruneau, to Quedragant, Dragonis, and
Gosquilant: to whom he sent like several letters: Gandalin carrying them
likewise the same instructions that Enil had unto the Emperor, commanding
them expressly to assure them all, that he would not depart from the castle La
montaigne defendu, before their arrival there, but meant to keep it while
breath was in his body. Gandalin and Enil had so good and prosperous a weather,
that in less than fifteen days after their departure, they passed the
country of Messine, and landed at Saragource, where Gandalin hired a
Brigandine to execute his charge. And to the end you may understand what effect
their messages did work, I will leave Gandalin traversing the Mediteranean
Sea, and entering into the Ocean, and speak of Enil that arrived at Ostre,
where as then he found the Emperor accompanied with king Florestan, devising
only of hawks and hounds: but when they espied Enil, presuming he brought
some ill news, they asked him where he left Esplandian: Enil knowing how to
behave himself, kissed the letters, and gave one to the Emperor, the other to
the king of Sardaigne: which having read, and perceiving them to be of credit,
took him apart where he discovered unto them all you heard before. With that
the Emperor leaving Enil with king Florestan, went unto the gentlemen and
knights that then were present, and said unto them: My friends, we must all to
the wars: my nephew Esplandian has advertised me (by this gentleman
expressly sent unto me) that the king of Turkey and all his allies are in
arms, and have raised a mighty army to assail my brother ye Emperor of
Constantinople: but I vow to God (if he give me life and help) that before the
month of September next ensuing, I will be there with such a force, that I
will make him twice repent how he so rashly does assail, and learn him to
defend himself. Wherefore let every man be ready, for I will go my self in
person: and calling king Florestan he asked him if he would go with him: My
lord (said he) to morrow I will send to all my ports and havens, that all the
ships of war that can be found may be in a readiness: mean time I will in all
parts assemble men to do as my nephew Esplandian has required. My Lord (said
Enil) my lord Esplandian has written by Gandalin to king Amadis and other of
his friends, whom he has desired to join with you, so yt I hope about one
time all your armies will be ready, and that wiihout long staying for each
other, you will assemble all together. Truly (said king Florestan it was well
devised. With that diverse captains were dispatched into sundry places to give
order for their men, and to ballace, rigge, and prepare vessels for their
voyage into the East. Gandalin on the other side coasting the Isles of Maiorque
and Minorque, leaving Guinea and Barbary, passed the straits of Gibraltar, and
had so good a wind, that in few days without staying in Spain, he arrived
in great Britain with king Amadis, who as then continued in London, and
presented him with the letter that Esplandian sent, showing him likewise his
charge by word of mouth, the good and evil adventures that he had had since he
departed from Myrefleur, and among the rest the overthrow of the Turkish army
on the sea, the taking of king Armato, the occasion why the siege rose up
before the castle La montaigne defendu, the arrival of Gastilles, the taking
of Alfarin, and of the captain of Tesifant, the surprising of Galatia, the
loss of Vrganda: and lastly all what you have read at large in the chapters
going before. And to the end my lord (said he) that order may be had to prevent
the inconvenience he foreseeth to be prepared against all Christendom (if it
be not succored) he has expressly willed me to show you, that he has had
certain intelligence, that all the kings of the East parts have sworn and
promised, together to ouerrunne all Christendom: which is very likely,
considering the great preparations and assembly of men they have already made
in the Isle of Tenedos: which is such, that as our spies report, they are at
least six hundred sail of ships, and about four or five hundred thousand
men. God will help us if it pleases him, said king Amadis, for my part, I
will do what possible I may, and will like wise advertise king Perion my
father and my brother Galaor. My lord (said Gandalin) I have also charge to
travail unto them, and likewise unto Gasquillan, Don Bruneau, Quedragant, and
others, to whom Esplandian has written in like sort as he has done to you,
and has expressly given me in charge to see king Luisart, and do his humble
commendations unto him. It is great reason (said the king:) nevertheless I am
of this opinion, that before my mother ye queen you do not once declare the
occasion of your coming, but give her to understand that all is well, but not
unto the king, if you find him alone: for he is a man (as every one well
knows) to take all things with patience as they shall fall out: and because
my sons affairs require no delay, I pray you Gandalin after you have
refreshed your self a day or two, go on your journey as you have in charge.
So Gandalin that day remained there, during which time Queen Oriane talked
long with him: the next day he departed to see King Luisart and Queen Brisenne
at Mirefleur, who knowing he came of message from Esplandian, were exceeding
glad: the Queen although she were wise and very aged, yet could not change
her woman's nature, but before the king spoke any word asked him for her son:
but Gandalin (accustomed readily to devise excuses, as he had been instructed
by king Amadis) told her that he had left him in the firm Isle not well at
ease by reason of his long travel, but not so ill (said he) as that he could
not have taken pain to come hither and see you, but he feared least his
sickness would increase: wherefore he thought it better for him to keep his
chamber a while, than to entertain a long and envious ague for a long space:
which the queen easily believed: and for the hope she had shortly to see him,
she made no account thereof: nevertheless, the same evening Gandalin told king
Luisart all that you heard before, wisely excusing himself of the speech he
used before him unto the Queen, as king Amadis had given him charge: wherein
king Luisart commended him, and for the rest he promised to think thereon while
he travailed unto those with whom he had to do. In this sort Gandalin being
dispatched, returned to king Amadis, who in the mean time (persuaded by queen
Oriane) wrought a marriage for him, as you shall hear. You have read in the
beginning of our history of the services the gentlewoman of Denmark did for
them, and the things wherein she and Gandalin had been exercised: wherefore it
was reason, that having been partakers of their youthful toies, she should also
taste some of their prosperous fortunes. Wherefore queen Oriane moved king
Amadis to make a marriage between them two, but he thought the match unfit,
because the gentlewoman was already aged, and Gandalin being young and lusty:
nevertheless, as all women that are wise and of a quick conceit, can bring
their enterprises to effect, the Queen found means to get the kings consent:
whereby Gandalin was no sooner come from Myrefleur but he took him aside, and
said unto him: Gandalin, the queen is desirous to have you stay with us, not
only for the love she knows I bear unto you, but also for the good she
wishes you. And for this cause she would have you marry with the gentlewoman
of Denmark, whom she loves, and will do much both for her and you, if you
consent thereto: you know her long time since both to be wise, good, and
virtuous, and for my part I pray you and counsel you thereunto. Gandalin would
gladly have excused himself, and to say the truth, he was too young for so old
a match: nevertheless having from his infancy learned to confirm his will to
ye of Amadis, he was content to do as pleased him: in such sort, yt in less
than three days after the marriage was celebrated and ended. Mean time king
Amadis took the letters and instructions that Gandalin should carry to
Gasquillan and king Bruneau, and sent them by a gentleman of his named Handro,
cousin german to the Countess of Flaunders, desiring them as much as possible
they might to aid his son in his so good a cause: but the next week
following Gandalin more affected to the service of Esplandian tha^ to court his
wife, departed from thence to travail into France unto king Perion, and from
him to Sobradise to Galaor. Mean time king Amadis sent for all the pilots,
masters, and mariners of his country that he could find, commending king Arban
of Norgales, to take care for all things requisite for the enterprise and
charges of such a usage, both for men and vessels. In this manner did the
affairs touching these wars proceed through the greatest part of Europe, while
all the kings in the East by little and little assembled themselves together, as
you shall hear.

CHAP. XLVIII. How the great city of Constantinople was besieged by the
princes of the East, and of the salies that were made by those of the city to
keep them from the same.
THe army of the Pagan kings daily assembling in the Isle of Tenedos, ye
emperor mean time fortified his city of Constantinople both with men and
victuals in ye best manner he could, commanding those yt had charge of his army
by sea to cause all his vessels to come into the Haven of the town, which he
caused to be barred with a chain, that on that side he might be out of danger.
The^ he sent diverse brigandines unto Natolia, to discover the Pagans army, and
bring him certain news: Mean time, the country people reaped all their
corn, and brought it to the city. Within eight days after the Brigandines yt
were sent forth, discovered in the straights of Hellespont the great fleet of
the Turks yt lay at Abides, where they stayed a certain time to take in
victuals and other munitions necessary for their ships. Whereof ye emperor
being advertised, caused his men to muster, giving Frandalo charge of the
dragon gate, so called, because yt at the foundation of the city, when it was
named Bisance, there was found a marvelous Dragon under the foundation of ye
gate, which dragon was bound chained, and norished, so long time, yt it was
thought most strange. Norandel had charge of the gate called quiline, and
Gastiles his nephew of that called ye Well, so named of a great and profound
well that stood hard by it. And causing the other gates to be rampired up,
provided for all things as a wise and valiant captain should do in such a
case. With that a Grecian that had been taken by the Turks, came into ye city,
and assured the^ for certain yt the Soudan of Liquie was himself in person
with king Armato, and almost all the kings of the east, having two hundred
Galleys, as well great as small, fifty great ships, thirty mahoi^es, and one
and twenty cafords, that are ships not much unlike to galleys: besides thirty
foistes and diverse brigandines, barks, galions and sciffes, wherein they had
laid their victuals and other munitions: and for their number of footmen, they
might be about some three hundred and fifty thousand men, saying likewise, that
Alphorax had the chief charge at sea, and Armato on land, and that their
determination was never to depart from Constantinople, till they had destroyed
it, and from thence would go to Rome, and further if they rould. The sixth day
after, this great army (passing the gulf of Propontide) came into the
straights of Constantinople, entering in the great sea, where they remained
during the siege, robbing all the country about, where first they stayed a
week before they landed any of their men: mean time, certain galleys and
small ships set forward to make an alarm in the haven, from whence (to their
great loss) they were repulsed, for ye six of the principallest of them were
sunk in the sea. Nevertheless, the next day following they began to land, and in
great numbers thought to win the gate: there were many brave blows both with
sword and spear given on both parts, and many a valiant man ended their days,
and became meat to fishes. There ye knights of great Britain showed themselves
not to be unacquainted with such dangers, and who so had beheld Norandel,
Frandalo, Manely, and Talanque repulse the enemy, yt thought to advance
themselves, might eastly judge with what desire they fought. But what should I
stand longer to describe this conflict? To conclude, ye gate was defended, and
the enemies repulsed from the same, yet their number was so great, ye
notwithstanding the valor of the Emperors men, they landed and lay within two
bows shot of the city, they of the city being forced to retire. The Pagans
being on land, divided themselves into four parts, in such sort, yt the city
was so well besieged, that not a man could enter or come forth without their
leave. Wherefore king Armato presently caused great number of ladders to be
prepared, the most part of them double, hoping before the week were ended, to
assault, take, spoil, and destroy the City. But they within slept neither
night nor day, but made artificial fires, with all other things requisite for
such a charge. The Pagans stayed not long to execute their purpose, so that
upon a monday in the morning, they came in great fury to set fire on the gates,
and to scale the Town although for ye time they lost their labors, and many of
the^ their lives, where in the end they were constrained to retire to their no
little shame and great confusion. And in their retraict, Norandel with four or
five hundred men, issued at a postern gate, and set upon them behind, which put
the^ in such fear, yt they drove them to their tents. Yet not being content
with this first repulse they determined on friday after either to die, or enter
into the town. And the day appointed, ran unto ye walls, where the number of ye
assailants was so great, and the assault given in so many places both by sea
and land, yt if God had not provided for them, it is most certain ye town had been taken: especially on Frandalos side, for the most part of his men fled away
from their guard: whereby it happened, yt more then a hundred Turks mounted on
the walls, but they stayed not long, for yt the emperor (who during the assault
stayed in the midst of the city with the rest of all his power to aid such
places as had most need) advertised thereof, marched to Frandalos quarter, and
with such force repulsed the enemy, that he made the^ glad to get them thence,
in such sort, yt they received no less loss at the second assault then at the
first. It is true, ye ten of ye knights of great Britain were slain at ye
conflict, which much grieved their companions, specially for ye loss of
Ledarin, of Feiarque, of Trys, and Imosil of Burgundy. This second assault
having had such issue as you heard before, Armato went to counsel with all ye
other kings and princes to know what they should do, where it was concluded to
keep their tents, and so enclose ye town: for to get it by assault, they knew
full well they should but lose their labors wherefore they meant no more to try ye
same: but many times made skirmishes with ye city to their no little loss.
Thus they passed above a month without doing any thing worthy ye rehearsing,
till one day among ye rest, a gentlewoma^ belonging to the souldan of Liquie
came on message to the gate ye Norandel had in charge, of who^ she asked if ye
knight of the great serpent were among them. Wherefore? said Norandel. I bring
him (said she) a letter from the cheef and most courteous knight in all Asia.
Norandel desirous to understand the contents of the letter, said he was the
man. Then look upon it (said she) at your leisure: And if you think it good
return an answer: with that she turned her horse, and rid the same way that
she came. Which done, Norandel opened the letter, the contents whereof are
these.

Rodrigue great Soudan of Liquie, friend to the gods, and enemy to their
enemies, defendor of the Pagan law: to thee that call thy self knight of ye
great serpent, greeting. Know thou that ye cause of our long voyage by Sea to
enter into these countries, has been in hope to be revenged of the outrages
that my uncle Armato king of Turkey has received at the hands of thee and thy
companions, not having once offended thee: and although we are most sure of ye
destruction of the wicked emperor ye favors thee in thy so wicked and
damnable enterprises, and that before long time be past, both he and his shall
end their lives by our hands, yet should I be much grieved, that this
misfortune should happen unto thee, before I have proved my body against
thine, because of the renown yt is spread of thee throughout the world.
Wherefore choose whether thou will accept of the combat between us two alone,
of ten to ten, a hundred to a hundred, or of greater number as thou
think good. Swearing unto thee, by all our gods, that those thou shall bring
with thee for that cause, shall receive no more displeasure then my self,
unless it be by such as are ordained to fight with them, according to the
agreement we shall make. Wherefore make me an answer worthy such a Knight,
that thereby thy honor be not stained.

Norandel having read this letter, showed it to his friends, who were all of
advise to grant the Soudan his request. But Norandel would determine nothing
before he made the Emperor acquainted, under whose conduct during the siege,
he had submitted himself: whereupon he went to speak with him, and having
showed him the contents of the letter that he had received in Esplandians
name, and the counsel of his companions, the Emperor asked him what he
thought therein. My lord (said he) if it pleased you, that I and nine others
which I will choose, shall undertake this combat, you shall do us great favor.
My good friend (said the Emperor) you see the estate wherein I am, and the time
wherein I ought to keep, not only you and others wherein I put my whole
affiance, but the meanest soldier in this Cittye. Nevertheless, I will so much
agree unto your will, that if you and your companions think it good, I am
content you do it. My lord (said Norandel) both I and they most humblye crave
it of your grace. Well then (said the Emperor) If it pleases God, you shall win
honor thereby, as you have done before in many as perrillous adventures as
this is. Norandel thanked the Emperor, and the same day caused his Knights of
great Brittaigne to be assembled together, by whose advise there was an
Answer framed to the Soudans letters, the contents whereof do follow.

The knights that are servants to Jesus Christ, being at this time with the
Emperor of Constantinople, for the defense and augmentation of the Christians
name, to thee Rodrigue Souldan of Liquie, like greeting thou have sent unto the
knight of the great serpent: a gentlewoman that says she belongs unto thee,
that has given us a letter directed unto him, the contents whereof are in two
points. In ye first, you complainest of the enterprises he has made against
thine uncle king Armato: in the other thou show a desire you have to prove
thy person against his, or a greater number against a greater, as he shall think
it good. But for yt the knight thou writest unto at this present is not here,
nor in place whereas he can return thee answer, we thought it convenient in his
behalf to satisfy thy request, and to accept the offers thou have made unto
him: assuring thee, yt here is the son of a king, and nine other knights with
him yt will fight with thee and as many more of thine, if thou be content
therewith: Advise thy self the^ herein, and having received thy answer, with
safe conduict safely to go and come, we will not fail to be in the place where
you shall appoint.

This letter sealed up, Norandel gave it to one of his squires to bear it to
the soudan, who made him answer yt he desired only to prove his body against
the knight of ye great serpent and none other. But (said he) if those yt sent
you hither have any desire to fight against ten of my knights, they shall find
the^ ready, being as great gentlemen and of as high a lineage as they are. And
as touching their safe conduict, I will so well provide for it, yt they shall
have occasion to think well of me: wherefore return thou unto the^, and let me
know their answer. With that the squire having his dispatch, went and came so
often between them, that in the end the combat of ten to ten was fully agreed
upon, and the lists appoint hard before the Town: where they the next morning
the ten knights went, whose names were as follows. Norandel, Garuate du Val
Craintif, Talanque, Manely, Ambor de Galdel, Elian le delibere, Brauor son of
Balan, Trion cousin germane to Queen Briolanie, Imosil de Burgoigne, and
Listoran of the silver bridge.

CHAP. XLIX. How the ten Christian knights entered into the lists, and of the
combat between them and ten Pagan knights that belonged to the Souldan of
Liquie.
ALL that night the ten Knights watched in the principallest church of
Constantinople, confessing themselves, and praying unto God as if they should
presently die: The next day as the sun began to appear, the Emperor
accompanied of diverse Noblemen, the Empress, ye Princess Leonorine, Queen
Minoresse, with diverse other Ladies and Gentlewomen, came unto them, where they
heard mass devoutly, that done, they returned unto the palace where Norandel
and his nine companions armed themselves, the ladies serving them for squires,
in such sort, as Norandel received such favor at queen Minoresses hands, that
she found means to help to buckle on every piece of his armor one after the
other. As she was busy about him, he found means to say unto her: Madame,
the honor that you do me, makes me so courageous, that this day I hope to
make it known to those that shall behold us fight, how much my strength is
now increased by your means. But if it pleased you to bestow some favor upon
me, that I might bear the same about my armor, I should account my self for
one of the most happy knights living on the earth. My good friend (said she)
the most precious jewel yt I can give unto you, is my heart yt shall accompany
yours, to the end, that being united together, they may the better preserve
both your life and mine. And taking a bracelet of gold, that from her infancy
she had always kept, she tied it about his right arm. And this circle (said
she) being round as you behold it, shall without ceasing be witness of our
loves, serving for a rampart to this army: which (if it pleases God) in
defending it shall so well defend his master, yt he shall return in as good
health as I desire he should. Norandel thanked her most heartily: mean time
Leonorine entertained Talanque, Manely and the rest, to whom she said: My
friends, I hope the Lord will show you so much grace that the victory shall be
yours, for the combat you take in hand is not for to defend the honor of a
Gentle woman, but the glorious faith of Christ. If therefore it be so, ye
strength proceeds from him, be you the^ well assured, yt he will impart so much
to you as you shall want. Madame (said Talanque) at other times we have been at
the like feast, from whence we have returned to the great expense of those yt
called us thither: as (if it be Gods will) we hope this day to do ye like.
Wherewith taking their leaves of her, they went to find their horses, and being
mounted, the emperor with great number of knights and gentlewomen brought them
to the gate: And committing them to God, the ten knights marched bravely to ye
place of combat, where the souldan with a great number of his friends met the^,
asking them whom the emperor had appointed judge on their side. Souldan (said
Norandel) we desire no other judge then your self, that are accounted a
courteous and most faithful prince. By all my gods (said he) I had rather die a
thousand deaths, then you should endure the least injury in the world: we
believe it well (said all the knights. With yt he caused them to enter into the
lists at one end, and the ten pagans at the other: but before they entered into
fight, he called Norandel and his companions, and said unto them: My friends, I
pray you let me show you what the custom of my country is in such affairs:
the^ if you think good, you may observe it, if not, my knights shall keep your
custom if it be indifferent. Show us the^ (said Norandel) what it is, and if
ye same be reasonable, we will not refuse it. You shall understand (said he) yt
all knights iustle one against one, to ye end, yt all men may know ye
excellency of the victor: And if any one be ouerthrown, he yt is on horseback
shall not assail ye other before their companions have run out their course:
Then he that is on horseback shall alight, and shall fight it out by dint of
sword with him that before was ouerthrown. Because it chances oftentimes, that
the best knights that are fall into such inconvenience, only by the fault and
means of bad horses, which cause them diverse times either to fail in striking
of their enemy, or else not to run their right course: Which cannot be excused
in those that are on foot, to whom it is permitted to succor each other if
need require. Truly (said Norandel) that custom is well ordained, and I and my
companions will observe the same. Wherewith the soudan went out of the lists,
causing his Heralds to proclaim the fight: With that a Pagan stepped forth
against Norandel, that refused him not: but covering himself with his shield,
they met so fiercely, that their spears were broken to their wrests, meeting
body to body with so great strength, that the Pagan fell over his horse tail,
lying flat upon the ground: but Norandel had no hurt, only that his horses
shoulder was thrust out of joint, so that he lighted of, staying til the rest
had run their course, as he had promised. Then Garuate du Val Craintif ran
against one of the other, and they charged each other in such sort, that their
feet failing in their stirrops, they were both cast out of their saddles. Then
Talanque ran against the third Pagan, to whom fortune was more favorable then
to any of the rest: for they ran so well, that neither of them once started
aside, or moved in their saddles, and yet brake their spears in many pieces.
The like chanced to Manely and Ambor, but not to Brauor the son of Balan, for
he hit him that ran against him right in the breast, and threw him from his
horse. And presently therewith Imosil of Burgundy had so great a stroke with a
lance, that his eyes started in his head, and was therewith so much
astonished, that his horse bare him to the side of the b^rriers, where he fell
down flat. Elian le delibere, and he that ran against him, were constrained
to hold by their horses maines. Listoran of the silver bridge missed his
stroke, and his enemy likewise: the like happened to Trion, and the last that
ran with him. That done, all they that were on horseback, lighted down to
fight with swords, and there began between them such a fight as the like had
not been seen of so few knights together, maintaining themselves so bravely
one against the other, that the strongest of them was so weary and out of
breath, that they were constrained to rest. And as Norandel leaned upon his
sword which he rested on the ground, the bracelet that Minoresse gave him fell
downward upon his arm, which put him in so good remembrance of her, that
clean forgetting all the travail he he had taken before, he spoke so loud
that every man might hear, and said: By God, sir Knight, this rest does not
beseem us: many men will from henceforth be in doubt of the great glory that
now we mean to win. Wherefore let every man show forth what he can do, and
let no man spare. Wherewith taking the little piece of his shield that rested
in his hand, and lifting up his arm, he gave so great a blow unto his enemy,
that he made him reele therewith: and doubling it, struck him so surely on the
helmet, that with the blow the Turk was forced to kneel down, and let his
sword fall out of his hand: which Norandel seized upon being ready to strike
off his head, if he had not cried him mercy: which Talanque and Manely
perceiving, employed their forces in such manner, that it might easily be
judged they would soon obtain the victory. As for Brauor he had already
stricken his knight down, wherefore he ran to help the rest, and Norandel
likewise. With the which help it soon appeared, that they which rested yet to
overcome would not long resist: for in short space they found themselves in
such extremity, that unless the Souldan of Liquie had desired the Christian
knights to stay a while, they had all died: but calling Norandel unto him, he
said: I pray you (said he) proceed no further in this combat, and content your
selves that I account my knights for vanquished, as in truth they are, and so
hardly handled, that the force you shall from henceforth use against them,
shall more be holden for a kind of cruelty than any chivalry. Nevertheless if
my request may take no place with you do as you think good. Souldan (said
Norandel) if they acknowledge it at our hands and ask us mercy, they shall
not fail to have it: for it was never our custom to use force to such as
could not stand against us. Content your selves (said he) that I that am their
Lord yield you the victory, and I pray you therefore show mercy unto them,
swearing unto you by my crown (if you do them so much good) that while I
live, I will not be unmindful of the same. With that the ten Christian
knights went out of the field, and mounting on their horses, took their way
unto the city, where the Emperor stayed for them, for he had seen the issue
of the combat, and how they returned victors: but he heard not what words had
past between them, till they being lighted off their horses, told him what was
done, for the which he praised God, esteeming more of them for their courtesy
they had shown unto the enemy.

CHAP. L. How Queen Calafre came to aid the Pagans, and of the maruailous and
perilous assault that she gave to the city of Constantinople.
THe renown of this war undertaken by the Kings, Taborlans, Souldans,
Califfes, and Princes dwelling in Tartaria, India, Arabia, and other countries
in the East, against the Emperor and his Empire of Constantinople, was spread
so far abroad, that it was known to the puissant Queen Calafre reigning in
Califorine, a most fertile and pleasant country, confining on the head of the
river Boristenes, hard by the foot of the Riffee mountains. This country
whereof I speak, was sometimes peopled with good knights and men of all
quarters, but the women upon malice devised a means to kill them all,
establishing a law among themselves, that from that time forwards they would
acknowledge for Lady and Queen one of their own country women, governing
themselves as the Amazons used to do. Whereby it was not lawful for any of
them to use the company of men above once or twice a year, upon the days and
times by them appointed, when they went out of their own country and used
their neighbors help, with whom God knows if they found not means to make
them pay the usury of the time lost, in such sort, that most of them returned
home with child: but the bringing up of their children was far different, for
the maiden children were kept alive, burning their right paps, but not the
(...) children, for as soon as they were borne they put them to death, having
agreed not to suffer one alive, or else so few, that they very easily might
overcome them. For this cause often times they warred against the Tartarians
bordering on their country, putting them to great trouble by diverse and
continual invasions, as well by sea as by land. In their laws and customs
they observed so great rigor, as that if any man (by casualtie or otherwise)
fell into their hands, he proved for food unto a great number of griffo^s,
nourished among them when they were young, being so tame and gentle, that never
any hawk knew better the Faulkoners lure, then those gentle birds knew the
voice of her that ordinarily fed them. To come unto the point, this queen of
Califorine being a woman of great spirit, valiant, hardy, young, fair, and of
good behavior, hearing of the wars undertaken against the Christians, was
desirous to be there, not for any ill she wished them, but only for to know
them, and to see their country that bare so great renown. And for that cause
she assembled great numbers of the principal ladies of her country, showing
them what honor they might obtain in that voyage: which may peradventure be
such (said she) that by our force and great prowess we may greatly augment
our Empire, being feared and redoubted of each man, and not continue always
buried among these mountains, as they in times past did, of whom at this
present we now possess and enjoy the place. The Queen in this sort could so
well persuade them, that they being moved with a marvelous desire to go with
her, presently prepared their ships, and set sail for Thracia, with so good
and prosperous a wind, that the tenth day after the assaults of
Constantinople, they arrived in the army of Armato, where they were honorably
received: and after diverse speeches used by the Souldan of Liquie, and other
princes of the camp unto the queen of Califorine, specially touching their
determination concerning that great enterprise, she being sorry they had done
so little against the town, desired them that she might once have leave to try
her fortune against it, by means that she would use. And the better to induce
them thereunto, she told them she had fifty griffons that would not fail
(being let out of their cages) to sease upon the Christians without hurting of
her women, because they knew them and had been nourished with them. And while
they take their flight (said she) I will give such an assault against the
town, that without doubt we will enforce the same: for if the Emperors
soldiers appear but to defend the walls, my Griffons shall be ready to carry
them clean away, as the Merlin does the lark. But to the end (said she) your
men receive no hurt, let them abide within their tents till they be shut into
their cages. When king Armato and the Souldan of Liquie heard the great zeal
and affection she showed to employ her forces, as also the invention that she
had, they all agreed that the next day after she should do what liked her.
Whereupon she sent presently to her that kept the griffons, that she should
give them nothing for to eat of all that day, that when they meant to use them
at the assault, they might be greedier: and further sent word by sound of
drum, that all her companies should be ready the next day early in the
morning, to give assault unto the city. Queen Calafre having in this manner
provided for her enterprise, at the time appointed all her women armed
according to their manner (the most part of them bearing bows) ran with
great fury unto the walls, and with their ladders began to mount up: with
that the alarm went about the city, all men running to defend the same: and
as they were some upon the walls and other places of defense, the Queen made
sign to let the Griffons loose, which being hungry and flying over the town,
seized upon such as they could find abroad: wherewith the Emperors soldiers
were in so great fear, that most part of them that fought, forsook the walls
to hide themselves. Alas what pity was it to see soldiers, citizens, knights,
and others, yea women and little children, and all whatsoever they could get
into their claws taken up into the air, and sometimes having taken them up,
they let them fall upon the stones, whereby they had a strange and cruel
death: surely if God had not kept the City better than those that had the
charge, it is most sure it had been taken at that time. But there happened a
strange case, for as the Griffons held their prey, and that the Knights of
great Britain with some small number of others, resisted the assault made by
the women, the Turks (that had been advertised not to come out of their tents
while they assailed the town) moved with too greedy a desire to sack the
Citte which they thought surely had been taken, ran unto the assault making
such a noise, that the Griffons (feeding on their preyes) left the bodies they
had seized upon, and flying up again, seized on them that they saw come
running to the town, whereof in short space after they made so great a
butcherie, that more than four hundred Turks were presently slain by them:
mean time those within the town perceiving that good fortune, did so fiercely
repulse the Californiens, that their principal women lay dead within the
ditches: wherewith the Queen was forced to retire, knowing her enterprise
would not take effect as she desired it should, not by reason of her
soldiers, but in that they kept not in as they had promised. Wherewith she
commanded to take the birds again, but the Falconers could not by any means
make them to come in, before they had slain and devoured above a thousand
Turks and others, whereof they only sucked the blood. Wherewith king Armato
and the Souldan of Liquie were so grieved, that from thenceforth they began to
show so hard a countenance to the Queen, that she was in the mind to return
into her country, not offering from that time once to give stroke with sword
to their advantage. Yet not long after she was appeased, and fought with King
Amadis, as it shall be showed you at large in the end of this our fifth Book.
And that we may have the better means to attain thereto, we will now
return again unto the Christian Princes, that assembled their powers and
forces to help the Emperor, imbarking themselves as presently you shall
hear. But before they arrived at Constantinople, many good knights both of
great Britain and others were slain within the city, not only in the
assaults made against it by the Pagans, but at the last assault made by the
queen Calafre, among the which, none were so much lamented as Ledarin de
Faiarque, Trys, Imosill of Burgundy, and the two sons of the giant Balan.

CHAP. LI. How the Christian Princes as well of the East as West parts
assembled their forces to aid the Emperor of Constantinople, and of their
navigations.
IF you have read the discourse of this our history, it has been showed you
before, how Enil went unto the Emperor of Rome, and Florestan king of
Sardaigne, and what became of Gandalin after he had passed the straights of
Giberaltar, and entered in the Ocean sea, even to great Britain and other
places, where he found king Amadis and others, to whom he had charge to go:
Now we must declare the rest. You shall therefore understand, that Gandalin
having soiourned eight days in London, more by the commandment of king
Amadis and Queen Oriane, than for the pleasure that he took in the woman
they had caused him to marry, knowing the affairs wherein he had left his
companions, departed from thence, and travailed so long, that he arrived in
France, and went unto king Perion to whom he gave the letters that his son
and grandchild sent unto him: and withal declared the state of the East
countries, as they then were, with the inconvenience that might fall unto all
Christendom, if the Empire of Constantinople were in obedience to the
infidels. So well could Gandalin tell his tale, that the good old king Perion
moved with a holy zeal, determined to go himself in person, and to take with
him great quantity of ships and men, furnished for the wars. Gandalin stayed
not long with him, but while he prepared himself, he went into Scotland,
Norway, Sobradise, Denmark and Sweathland, and did his Embassages so well,
that all the Kings and Princes to whom he went, determined with all speed to
aid Esplandian, in such sort, that in short time after their ships were ready,
and those of Sweathland, Norway, and Denmark, come unto the port of Suer, from
whence setting sail, they coasted along Freseland, Holland, and Braband, till
they arrived at Bulloigne, where king Perion had prepared great number of
Ships, Hulkes, and other vessels: which being furnished with men, victuals, and
munition necessary for the wars, hoised sail and put to sea. And coasting
Normandy, came to little Brittaigne, where they ankered in S. Mathewes Haven,
where the Kings, Luisart and Amadis accompanied of Grumedan and diverse other
knights, were arrived to refresh themselves: having passed the Isle of
Sorlingue, the Irish men embarked themselves at the cape Antiquan, and the
Scots at cape Basso. And having sailed the way that the Brittons had past,
joined with the Western Princes that went that voyage, in such sort, that
within three days after they set sail, and having a Northeast wind, they
discovered the coast of Spain, passing the Port of Finis terre in compostelle:
after that the cape S. Vincent: and drawing on the left side, they passed the
straights of Gibraltar, and leaving Barbary and Guinde on the right hand,
sailed toward Tamar, Austora, and Lagarde, minding to leave Maiorque and
Minorque, to enter into ye straights of Busina and Monaco, and from thence to
sail to the ports of Elese and Corse, where they met with Florestan king of
Sardaigne and his fleet, but before they arrived there, fortune was so contrary
unto them, that certain of their Gallions could not follow the ships, but
stayed behind to the number of eight, being so scattered, yt they made account
they had been lost. Nevertheless, the next day they arrived all at Port S.
Luce, where without longer staying they passed forward to go to Regi, where the
army of the Emperor of Rome (coming from Osty) lay at anchor staying for them.
Where they continued six days, not only to take in fresh water, but also to
calke and mend their ships and other vessels that had need: the seventh day
having a good wind, they hoysed ankers, and setting sail, coasted along the
country of Morea, coming to cape de Maluasie, where the wind fell somewhat
contrary: but in the end the sea waxing calm, put forward to Cape Calon, and
the Isle of Negrepont: and entering into the Archipelago they discovered the
side of the cape Athos, till they approached Galiopi, leaving the I Will of
Tenedos, because they would not be discovered by the Turks that Armato had set
there to keep a passage for his victuals to be brought unto the army: where
they stayed not long but they entered into the goulfe of Propontide, coasting
Thrace, till they came unto the Port of Salombre, which is not above thirty
miles from the city of Constantinople, where they landed, that they might the
better approach the Pagans camp: with that they agreed among them that king
Childadan and Quedragant should be Generals of the army by sea: and having
left sufficient number of men for the furnishing and safe keeping of their
ships, their fleet sailed toward Constantinople, hoping to set upon Alphorax
and his army by sea before they should perceive them. But it fell out
otherwise, for the Turks that had spies in all places, discovered them, not
suffering Alphorax to fight, desiring him most earnestly only to keep the
entry of the straits to take all means from the town to be victualled on
that side. Which king Childadan and Quedragant understanding, would not hazard
themselves, but ankered within half a mile of the enemy, staying for king
Luisart, the Emperor of Rome, and those that marched by land, mean time
giving diverse skirmishes to the enemy with their Pinnaces, but Alphorax for
all that would not leave his hole, lying as close as possibly he could: on the
other side Armato and his company being advertised of the great aid that came
toward the town, caused their forces to assemble, determining to keep the
side of the great sea, by ye which they might easilier recover victuals, as
well from Natolia as out of Tartaria. The kings Amadis, Perion, and others made
such have, that the ninth day after they encamped themselves in ye sight of
Constantinople right before their enemies, in a place that seemed most
convenient. But if the Pagans at the first were much abashed to see those
succors, the Emperor and those within ye town were not much less, doubting it
had been some new forces come against the town: for they had not any
intelligence of the sending of Gandalin and Enil to the christian princes, that
brought with them a multitude both of ships and men, as well knights as others.
Now to return to the Christians fleet: King Childadan knowing that Alphorax
played the fox, desired Quedragant (having equal power with him) to be
content that he with threescore pinnaces might skirmish with him, that thereby
if it were possible, he might provoke him to come out, which he agreed unto:
wherefore setting sail, he made toward the enemy, so near, that they were
ready to fight hand to hand: nevertheless Alphorax for that time would not touch
the bait, but entered farther in the straights: wherewith king Childadan
retired, and came unto the haven of the city, making the brauest show that
might be seen: those of Constantinople perceiving the bandirols and streamers
of great Brtttain and of other christian princes, made him answer with the
like, and so high, that the noise of the trumpets, clerons, and tabers was so
great, that Armato and all the Pagans might easily hear it. With that king
Childadan was received by the Emperor, Norandel, and others, to whom he showed
what aid was come unto them, and what princes had taken the voyage in hand. In
good faith (said the Emperor) they bind me for ever unto them, yet am I much
abashed how they understood of the wars between Armato and me. What? my Lord
(said Childadan) did Esplandian never tell you thereof? No I assure you (said
the Emperor) nor any of his companions, as far as I know. Is he not in the city
(said ye king?) In good truth (said Norandel) he would not leave the castle La
montaigne defendu, minding to keep it, if the Pagans came to besiege it. Assure
your selves (said Childadan) he will not long stay there before king Amadis
sends for him: for we determine presently to give battle, and if he should
fail at such a iourny, it would grieve him ever after. Much other talks had
the knights of Constantinople with Childadan and those that bare him company,
where he stayed till the next day in the morning, that he entered into his
ships to return unto Quedragant.

CHAP. LII. How Esplandian and the king of Denmark were sent for by Gandalin
that went unto the castle La montaigne defendu, where they stayed, attending
the succors of the Christian Princes, and of a letter that the Souldan of
Liquie and Queen Calafre wrote unto king Amadis and Esplandian.
KIng Childadan returned to Quedragant as you heard before, and the army on
land encamped in sight of the enemy, Amadis was advertised by those that had been in the city of Constantinople, that Esplandian and the king of Denmark
were at the castle La montaigne defendu, whereupon he sent Gandalin to fetch
them, Gandalin took shipping, and had so good a wind, that without any
adventure he arrived there, where he declared unto them how king Amadis and
almost all the Christian Princes were encamped within half a mile of the
Pagans host, and all what he and Enil had done considring their charge. And
because (said Gandalin) that our men are determined shortly to give them
bataile, they pray you to come unto them. Truly (said Esplandian) Gandalin my
friend, you have wrought the matter well, and I thank you for the pains that
you have taken. My lord (said the king of Denmark) are you not determined
that we go unto them? For my part, I had rather lose one of mine arms, then
fail thereof. Brother (said Esplandian) to morrow if it pleases God, the
great serpent shall bring us thither: before that time it had always used to
sail of it self, but as then it failed. For when they were entered into it,
it stirred not, whereat Gandalin much abashed, could not refrain to say: By
god, this vessel is like to the horse with the white leg, that fails us
when we have most need. Friend (said Esplandian) I am surely persuaded that
this proceeds by reason of Vrgandas imprisonment, who at this time is in
Melies power, and so well inchaunted, that her art profits her as little as
this vessel does us, that moved by her inchauntments, which at this present
has no means to stir, as you may well perceive. And Esplandian said true,
for at the same time the country wherein Vrganda dwelt, called The unknown
Island, (because it was always invisible) was as then discovered and seen of
all men. With that Gandalin counseled them to enter into the Pinnace, which
Esplandian and the king of Denmark did, and having a good wind, sailed
toward Constantinople, and on a sunday in the morning they espied the vessels
of king Childadan and Quedragant, which not long after they borded, where
Esplandian and ye king of Denmark were received with great joy: after that he
went to see his father and the rest of the knights that were on land, and
after an infinite number of imbracings and welcomes on all sides, they
determined to visit their enemies somewhat nearer, whereby many brave skirmishes
were made, where the women of Queen Calafre were continually in arms, and
among the rest, a sister of the Queens named Liote, a hardy and valiant lady,
that took a Frenchman prisoner, which certefied the Souldan of Liquie that
Amadis de Gaul king of great Britain, and Esplandian his son were in the
army. Whereof the Souldan and Queen Calafre being advertised, determined
together to write a letter unto them, the contents whereof do follow.

Rodrigue Souldan of Liquie, mortal enemy to the enemies of our gods, and
Calafre Queen of Califorine, a country most rich and abundant in gold and
precious stones, give you Amadis de Gaul king of great Britain, and your
son Knight of the great Serpent to understand, that the occasion of our
arriual in these countries, has been for these two causes. The one in hope to
destroy all Christendom, and the other to prove if we may take from you the
renown that is spread abroad of you, to be the two best knights living in ye
world: for we account our selves for such, as that if you will accept the
combat of your persons against ours, we will evidently make it known, that
our valor is no less then yours. And to the end the glory of the victors may
be known, the vanquished shall remain in their powers, to dispose of them as
they shall think convenient. Advise your selves therefore to answer us herein
by this our messenger, to whom we have given charge to declare unto you (if
you refuse this combat) that from henceforth we shall have just occasion to
attribute to our selves the advantage of the praises and endless glories that
fortune heretofore has given you, and to esteem of you as meanly in time to
come, as you have been highly renowned heretofore.

This letter given to the Gentlewoman that bare the first to Norandel, she went
unto the Christians camp, and being advertised which was Amadis tent, entered
therein, as he sat talking with king Luisart, Esplandian, and other good
knights. Where kneeling on the ground, she asked which of them was the knight
of the great Serpent and his father. Amadis spoke unto her and said:
Gentlewoman, I am the one, and this is my son. Is it your pleasure to speak
with us? The gentlewoman casting her eye upon Esplandian, maruelling at his
great beauty, spoke and said: In good faith king Amadis, I verily believe that
this is he, for I have heard him in diverse places esteemed for the same that
now I do behold in him. Gentlewoman (said Amadis) if you came into our camp
only to see him, you now have your desire. That has not ben only the cause
(said she) but to bring this letter which the Souldan of Liquie and Queen
Calafre send unto you both: wherefore having read it, I pray you return an
answer. With that ( Amadis having taken it in his hand) the Gentlewoman
departed out of the tent, attending their resolution. King Amadis having read
it, showed it to King Luisart and the rest that were in presence, wherewith
there rose great controversy among them concerning the refusal or acceptance
of the combat, for that the most part of them were of advise it should not be
accepted, showing diverse great and evident reasons to confirm the same, as the
greater number of enemies they had before them ready to give them battle,
and if it happen (said they) that fortune should be contrary to king Amadis and
Esplandian (in whom partly consists our hope) such hard chance would breed
great fear in diverse men that are now very willing and ready to do the best
they can. Others held the contrary, saying that it would be shame unto them al,
for that that refusal only would much encourage the enemy, but they were of
this opinion, that it might well be required that the number of the combatants
might be greater. In good truth (say Amadis) be it of two against two, twenty
against twenty, or of greater number, the victory is in the hands of God.
Wherefore in refusing thereof, I should do my self wrong, and cause a great
blemish to all Christendom, that would not be defaced in long time after.
Besides I have great hope of Gods help herein, for whose faith and honor I
have undertaken this voyage. When Esplandian heard his fathers mind, he spoke
boldlier and said: That he would take that combat upon himself alone, not
only against the Souldan and the Queen, but against two others more with
them, rather then it so should be refused: whereupon it was concluded, that
Amadis and he would fight, and sending for the messenger into the tent, Amadis
said unto her: Gentlewoman, you shall tell the Souldan and the Queen that I
and my son are content to do as they require, wherefore let them choose what
arms they will, and for the place it shall be between their camp and ours:
assuring them on the faith of a king, that not one of our soldiers shall once
remove, how soever we speed, which we desire likewise at their hands: and if
it be their desire to have the combat fought this day, we are content to do
it. With that the gentlewoman returned, and coming to the Souldans tent, she
declared her message unto the^, being such as you have heard: whereof the
Souldan was glad, but especially the Queen, for the great desire she had to
see Esplandian, wherefore she asked the Gentlewoman what she thought of him.
Madame (said she) I have in my life time seen many men and women that nature
had endued with great beauty, but by the gods I confess it is all but
painting in regard of that I have found in him: for he is so fair and
beautiful, that the more I think thereon, so much the more it makes me
conceive such beauty to be rather divine the^ humane. That is much (said the
Queen.) I know not (said the gentlewoman) what you mean by that word Much,
but I am well assured, if you had seen him as I did, that you would say as much
as I do, and it may be more. Truly (said the Queen) before I enter in combat
with him, I will first see him unarmed, and speak with him, not as an enemy to
an enemy, but as friends commonly do one unto the other. Madame (said the
Souldan) seeing it is your desire, it were good our Gentlewoman went again
unto them, to desire them to give you leave to come and visit them in their
camp, not to procure them any cause of envy, but to do them honor: and for
that cause to desire their safe conduct. This counsel seemed good unto the
Queen, and without longer staying she sent the Gentlewoman back again unto
Amadis and Esplandian whom she found yet in the Tent whereas she left them.
With that she told them what her message was, and the great desire the Queen
had to see them before they entered into combat. King Amadis could not refrain
laughing to hear the Gentlewoman express the affection her mistress had,
asking king Luisart what he thought therein. Son (said he) deny not her
request, for I assure you (since our coming hither) I have heard the Queen to
be esteemed a wise and beautiful Princess. You hear our answer (said
Amadis to the Gentlewoman) let the Queen come hither when she thinks good,
for she shall be heartely welcome. With that the Gentlewoman returned to the
Queen, who being greatly pleased with that answer, determined the next day
to go unto them. But she knew not well what manner of apparel she were best
to wear: sometimes she thought it fit to go as she used when she went to
bataile, and then presently changed opinion, thinking a woman's apparel would
be more seemly and convenient, seeing she went not to try their forces, but
only to win the love and favor of Esplandian, if she might procure the same.
And thinking on it all night long, in the morning when she meant to apparel
her self, she was resolved to dress her as women use to do, thinking she had
means enough afterward to show her self in habit of a knight, whereby she
might be seen both in the one and the other sort. Whereupon she caused her
most precious robes to be brought unto her, and apparrelling her self, forgot
not any thing that might once beautify or adorn her person, or that in her
opinion would deck her well, the better to be liked. And to bear her company
she took twelve of her own gentlewomen, so well furnished and set forth with
stones and pearls, that the like was never seen. That done, she sent unto her
ships for a most strange and monstrous beast, whereupon sometimes she used to
ride in great pomp. It was as big as a great Dromadary, the hair long and
somewhat yellow, black spots, his two ears hanging down unto his knees,
having but one eye, shining brighter then a burning glass, and stood right in
the midst of his forehead: out of his mouth there issued two great teeth like
horns, and although his feet were cloven like an ox, yet was there no Heart in
all the world yt could outrun him, were it in plain way, or over rocks. In
that manner she entered into the Christans camp, of whom she was not a little
wondered at before she came to King Luisarts tent, where Amadis and in a manner
all the principal captains of the army stayed for her, praying Quedragant to
go out to welcome her, which he did with great courtesy: for he had no sooner
espied her, but he stepped forward, and doing her great reverence, help her
to descend, and taking her by the arm, led her into the tent, where the lords
were all assembled, of whom she was most honorably received. But when she
beheld Esplandians beauty, she was so much surprised with the love of him, yt
she repented her coming thither, not so much for the small hope she had to
win him, (being diverse in religion) but doubting yt the fantasy newly entered
into her mind would so much estrange her force (by overmuch thinking upon him)
when she went to fight, yt thereby she should be in danger to lose the honor
and reputation she had gotten in arms among the best knights in all ye world:
which to prevent, she determined to stay the less time there, knowing the
nature of love to be such, yt it can steal the hearts of all persons, and
commonly makes himself possessor of it, before he that has it in
possession, can perceive it. And as the Princes entertained her with diverse
sweet and pleasant speeches, she turned to Esplandian and said: Sir Knight,
for two most excellent graces that are in you, I have taken the pains to come
and visit you: The first is the gift of beauty, which is such in you, as I
could never have imagined the same: The other is the force of your body and
magnanimity of your courage, whereby you are accounted altogether invincible.
The one I have seen with mine eyes to be so perfect, that I never hope to see
the like again, although I lived a thousand years and more: the other, ye
combat you shall have against the most puissant Souldan of Liquie will be a
witness unto us: and had it not ben that he requested me to fight against
king Amadis (because his only desire is to prove his body against yours) I
would have tried it my self. Of one thing can I well assure you, that if the
honor remain to us and life to you, I will afterward tell you a thing that
much imports me, and which I greatly desire to let you know before I sail
into my country. Now for this time I have satisfied my desire: wherefore my
lords (said she unto all the Princes) I beseech you pardon me in not using
longer speeches, for I know full well that my long staying with you, (thinking
to find that I hoped for) might possible cause me to lose my self, wherewith
I should be overmuch displeased, for that before sunnesetting I hope to be in
place where I will show such valor in arms, that he which never could be
vanquished by man (as it is reported) shall now receive an overthrow at a simple
woman's hand. Madame (said king Perion) fortune can do much when it pleases
her, if you do as you say, truly you shall do more then we can well believe,
but commonly ye workman is known by his work, and because the issue of the
combat is the glory of him or you, til then we will defer our judgments. And
although Amadis perceived himself much outraged by the queen, yet he made no
sign thereof, but taking her by ye arm, led her where her company stayed, and
as she mounted to return, with a smiling countenance he spoke unto her and
said: Madame, when we come to dealing of blows I beseech you show me not the
greatest extremity you can, because I was always a friend to women, and ever
will be during my life: whereunto the queen answered not a word, but rode unto
ye Pagans camp to arm her self. Mean time Brian de Moniaste arrived in the
Christians camp, who having ben sent by the king of Spain his father with a
great power of men into Africa, to besiege the town of Cesonie after called
Centie, was advertised by a pirate, of the Christians enterprise, and how their
army and great fleet had passed the cape of Finis terre, presently sent unto
his father to desire him to give him leave to go that voyage: whereunto by
much importunity he granted. For which cause Brian brake up his siege of
Cente, and entering again into his ships sailed to Cicile, and from thence to
Galipoli, and so to Constantinople, where he joined with the Christian princes
that received him most gladly.

CHAP. LIII. How king Amadis and Esplandian his son, fought against the Souldan
of Liquie and Queen Calafre, and of the battle fought the same day both by
sea and land, between the Christians and the Pagans.
QVeene Calafre returned to the Pagans camp as you heard before, presently
armed her self, and the Souldan like wise, and stayed not long before they
came unto the place where the combat was assigned, where not long after they
found Amadis and Esplandian: and because the two camps were not well assured
of each other (notwithstanding the oaths and promises on both sides made) they
set themselves in order of battle not stirring one foot: king Perion sending
word to Quedragant and king Childadan, that as they had intelligence from the
enemy, they should set upon their army by sea: the like word was sent unto the
Emperor of Constantinople, that he might likewise be prepared: and as the
four combatants were ready to strike each other, the Souldan called Amadis and
Esplandian, asking them if they would not swear and keep promise (according
to the agreement sent unto them by his gentlewoman) that the vanquishers
without impeachment should lead away the vanquished. I truly, said they,
therefore beware of us. With that Amadis made toward the Queen, and the
Souldan against Esplandian, to whom he gave so great a blow with his lance
into the shield, that he pierced it through: whereby diverse thought assuredly he
had been wounded to death, but it was not so, for the lance passed under his
saddle without any further hurt: but Esplandian gave him his exchange, striking
him so fiercely, that he made him loose both stirrup and saddle and fall upon
the ground, with so great might, that he rolled twice or thrice before he
stayed, in such manner, that the helmet flew off his head. Queen Calafre ran
against king Amadis, and he against her: and as they were in the middle of
their course, Amadis turned the but end of his lance against her, and passing
forward would not strike her: yet she held her lance down and struck his
horse in the steel of his forehead, and withal they met so strongly body to
body, that therewith the Queen fell down, and Amadis was constrained to
light, his horse was so astonished with the truncheon of the lance that stuck
within his forehead. But the Queen rose presently, and with her sword in hand
went toward Amadis, the like did the Souldan to Esplandian that had suffered
him to take breath and lace his helmet, not for any good he wished him, but
that at the end of his carere he espied the princes Leonorine standing on the
walls of Constantinople, whereat he was so abashed, that every man said, the
Souldan had hurt him in the body. Nevertheless within short space after they
knew the contrary: for he lighted on foot, where between them two was
fought the most perilous combat that ever was seen, for Rodrigue was as
valiant a knight in arms as any in his time: but Esplandian handled him in
such manner, that often times he made him clean forget the subtilties that
commonly he used in such affairs, and in the end used him so hardly, that it
might evidently be seen the victory would be his. Mean time the Queen used
all her force to overcome king Amadis, who holding in his hand a great
truncheon of a lance instead of a sword, gave her such a blow on the crest of
her helmet, that he made her eyes start within her head. Wherewith she being
much offended, spoke unto him, and said: What sir Knight? do you think me
either to he a dog or else a country clown, that you seem to beat me with
a staff? By my head before you escape out of my hands, there is no armor you
have but will be needful for you to the safeguard of your life. Calafre (said
Amadis) all my life time I have been a servant unto Ladies, and if at this
time I should begin with you to wish them ill, the good that others have
received at my hands would be less esteemed. You account me then (said the
Queen) one of that number: but you shall presently feel that I am something
more: with that she took her sword in both hands, and in great choler gave
him such a blow, that she claue his shield in two, and thinking to double her
stroke, Amadis stepped unto her and plucked hers from off her neck, with such
force, that she was constrained to kneel upon the ground. Nevertheless she
rose presently again, and thinking to be revenged, used all her force to
charge Amadis, who turning aside gave her such a blow with his truncheon hard
by the ear, and therewith made her so astonished, that her sword fell out of
her hand: wherewith he stepped forward, and taking her by the helmet, said unto
her: Now you shall be my prisoner whether you will or not, as well as the
Souldan is prisoner to my son. With that the Queen looked aside and
perceived that Amadis said true: wherefore she said: Truly I am your prisoner
seeing fortune will have it so: and therewith Rodrigue and Esplandian came unto
them, and they four going out of the lists, went unto the Christians camp:
the Pagans that saw them led away in whom in a manner consisted most of
their hope, when the camps should join in battle, made countenance to
rescue them: which caused the Christians to stand all day in order of battle:
mean time they agreed among themselves to send the Souldan and the Queen unto
Constantinople, Gandalin having charge to bring them thither, and present them
to the Princess Leonorine, from Amadis and Esplandian, who thanked them most
heartily. And before he returned again unto the camp, a soldier of Thrace
(that had dwelt in Tartaria above twenty year together) came and yielded
himself unto the Christians, and told King Perion and Luisart, that their
enemies determined the next day in the morning to surprise them before they
were aware, whereof they advertised the Emperor of Constantinople, to the end
he might be ready. There were in the city forty thousand men, whereof he
appointed thirty thousand to issue forth upon the enemies rereward, as soon
as they perceived the battle once begone, and gave likewise intelligence to
King Childadan and Quedragant, that his spies had brought him news that
Alphorax had unfurnished his ships of men to strengthen their army on land,
trusting to the straights which they mean to keep, hoping thereby to sail
into the Maiorque seas, if fortune favor not their enterprise: and there it
would be good (with the other Christian princes advise) that they should set
upon him, and that Frandalo with his fleet should second them. Which news
understood by the two Generals of the army by sea, they sent unto king Amadis
and the rest of the Commanders in the camp, to know their advise: whereunto
answer was returned, that they should follow the opinion of the Emperor of
Constantinople, which they should execute upon the next day in the morning:
whereupon Frandalo ceased not all night to make and prepare diverse kinds of
artificial fires, wherewith he made account to burn the most part of Alphorax
ships, which he did, as hereafter you shall hear. But to return to king
Armato and his forces: About an hour before day, according to their former
determinations, they began to march against the Christians, thinking to find
them sleeping, and thereby to slay their watch before they should have means
to set themselves in order of battle. Nevertheless they found themselves
deceived, for they were already set in order of battle, standing close, with
great desire to receive their enemy as they did: the Emperor of Rome had the
vantguard, and with him king Luisart: king Amadis, king Perion, Galaor, and
Esplandian the maine battle: and Florestan, Bruneo, and Balan, the rereguard.
On the Pagans side there marched first, the Souldan of Alaxa, threescore
knights, two Califfes, and four Tamorlanes, that in great fury set upon the
Emperor of Rome and his battle: where at their first arrival many a brave
knight was stricken down, both on the one side and the other, for Esplandian
and the Christian princes being feigned together, gave not one blow but it was
a deadly stroke: yet at the first they were repulsed by the great quantity of
arrows the enemies shot against them, which flew in so great number, that
hailestones never fell thicker out of the skies: whereby it fell out, that both
vantguard, maine battle, and reregard, endured much pain: with that
Norandel, Talanque, Manely, Trion, Landin, Licoran, Imosill, Palomie, Enil,
Ellan, and to conclude, all Esplandians companions with thirty thousand men
chosen by the Emperor, issued out of the city: which small troop (resolutely
determined) did so abash the Pagans, that in a manner they all lost their
courages: whereby they presently began to recule as far back as they
advanced themselves: wherewith those that before had been in fear took
courage again, and turning their faces on the enemy, recovered the ground
that they had lost, in such sort, that with good cause they might well cry,
Victory. On the other side, Quedragant and Childadan setting sail, made
toward the straights, at the entry whereof Frandalo ouertooke them with
fourscore vessels of all sorts: and as they had spoken together touching their
enterprise (considering the great power of their enemies) it was agreed that
Frandalo (that had proved them at other times) should first set upon them:
wherewith he began to sail forwards, and Alphorax likewise against him, giving
a sign of battle to his men, who with great courage entered upon ten of the
best galleys that the Christians had and sunk them in the sea: yet Frandalo
naught abashed, set fire on more than an hundred of their ships before
Childadan entered into fight: but not long after, he and Quedragant came unto
them, where good defense prevailed. In which fight they continued for the space
of eight hours without any sign upon which side the victory would fall
until Quedragant borded Alphorax ship and entered by force, slaying all that
were therein. What need I stand longer to discourse? The Turks seeing their
captain dead, and their manifest overthrow before their faces, being ready to
fall into the Christians hands, began to fly, and by force of oars entered
into the Maiorque sea: but not all, for there were taken, burnt, and drowned
about two or three hundred Galleys, Galleasses, Fustes, and Brigandines, the
rest saved themselves, in such sort as you heard before: to whom night was so
much assistant, that the chase endured not so long as else it would have done.
Alphorax dead, and his army overthrown; the Christians assembled themselves
together, staying to hear news from their army on land, which in the mean
time had had so much to endure, that wonder it was how they could hold out: and
among the rest the good old king Perion and Luisart seeing Esplandian raging
like a lion followed by the hunters, would not leave him fearing to loose him,
and so long they followed him, striking both on the right side and the left,
that they found themselves enclosed by above a thousand Turkish horsemen, not
having any other aid by them than Grumedan the Duke of Bristowe, Guilan,
Brandoyuas, Nicoran of the silver bridge, Cendil de gonate, and a few others.
Surely those eight or nine caused those that met them to buy full dearly their
approach, as not being the first danger wherein they had fallen: nevertheless
in the end being over weary and sore travailed with the blows they had given
and received, they were clean out of breath, and the worst was their horses
were slain under them, and they themselves so sore wounded, that they were all
slain in the place: only Esplandian that in a manner could scarce lift up his
arms when king Amadis his father with great number of Frenchmen found him
there: whereat the battle begun fiercer than ever it had been, for Amadis
and his company seeing the Kings dead and their companions lying on the ground,
and Esplandian fighting in the middle of them on foot, they were in a manner
mad, and therewith made such slaughter, that the Turks were forced to separate
themselves, and Esplandian horsed again, and being on horseback,
notwithstanding all his wounds, he showed well that his body was not weary,
for he followed the enemies in such sort, (moved with grief to see his
friends dead) that in short space (by the aid of his father and the rest that
followed him) he forced the S^uldan of Alaxa and his soldiers to turn their
backs and fly, and in his flight gave him such a blow with his sword upon
the head, that he struck him dead, and more than an hundred Pagans with him:
Amadis like wise did so valiantly, with all the Knights of France, great
Britain, and Swethland, specially the King of Denmark, Talanque, Manely,
Ambor, and Norandel, that wonder it was to see, yet had their valor little
prevailed without the aid that the Emperor of Constantinople brought thither,
with a great troup of horsemen that the Emperor of Rome had likewise gathered
together: by which means king Armato with thirty other Kings and their
retinue were clean overthrown, and the most part of them put to the sword:
the Christian Knights making such slaughter, that the blood ran about the
field in such abundance, as if it had rained blood a whole day together: and
greater had the abundance been if night had not come on, which separated them,
the Western Princes remaining encamped in the field, till day opened, that
they might accomplish their desires. Mean time Amadis caused watch and
Sentinels to be set in all places, because he had been advertised that King
Armato that had fled away, assembled his men by little and little, which to
do he caused horns and drums to sound throughout the field, making fire
round about the place where he had retired, sending two knights to the sea
side to know what had happened to his son: but news was brought him that he
was slain, and all his ships burnt and drowned, except fifty or threescore
that were at the end of the straights of the Maiorque sea, staying to hear
news of him, assure your selves that such news pleased him not too well:
nevertheless perceiving it more convenient to supply his own necessity than
to spend the time in sorrow and tears, he called such captains as he had
together, with whom he determined presently to depart, and before day to
imbarke that small number of men that rested, before the Christians should
perceive the same. With that he commanded from place to place that every man
should presently retire, and without noise make toward the sea; where being
arrived, they entered into their ships flying toward Tartaria in all the have
they could: whereof the Emperor of Constantinople being advertised, sent
Frandalo and diverse galleys with him to follow them, but all in vain: in the
mean time the hurt Knights and soldiers were brought into the city, and the
dead buried each according to his degree: wherein the Emperor showed great
affection, especially as touching the burial of the Kings Perion and Luisart,
for whom, Esplandian (coming to the Empire) and those that succeeded after
him, caused two Pyramides to be made, not any thing inferior to those which
sometime were erected in the city of Memphis, as well for the Kings Miris,
Chemnis, as others: and hard by them they buried the bodies of the valiant
knights Balan, Helian, Polimner, Enil, Grumedan, the good old man, and diverse
other knights that died in that battle, fighting in the defense of the faith
of Jesus Christ, with whom their blessed souls do now remain in joy. And
because no men^ion has been made of Queen Calafre since her captivity,
neither of the aid that she had brought unto the Pagan kings, it seems
reason that I should declare the occasion why her women fought not with the
rest, you must understand, that the Queen perceiving her in one day to be
taken not only with the love of the knight Esplandian, but by the force of his
father King Amadis, not long after she had been in the company of the princes
Leonorine, to whom Gandalin brought her, she sent unto her sister Lyote to
will her with her women to return to sea, keeping apart from all the Pagans,
without once stirring from thence, for any thing whatsoever should fall, till
she received further news from her, which was partly the cause of the enemies
overthrow: for they doubting some treason being separated in that sort, from
that time forward were in some fear and in greater suspicion than before: and
not without cause, for that if Lyote had aided king Armato both by sea and
land, as she might have done, if her sister had not forbidden her, it is
likely her esquadron of women being twenty thousand strong and somewhat more,
had done great mischief to the Christians: but God of his goodness provided
better for them.

CHAP. LIIII. How after the Pagans were driven out of Thrace, the Emperor of
Constantinople renouncing his Empire, invested Esplandian therewith, marrying
him to his daughter the princess Leonorine.
THe obsequies and funerals of the Kings, Princes, Lords and others, that died
in the battle, being finished, the wounded cured, and all things set at rest:
the Emperor of Constantinople knowing that Amadis and those that were come
with him from the Western parts would return again into their countries,
desired them to assemble, showing them that his meaning was to let them know
what he determined to do before they went from thence: The next day in the
morning they all met in the emperors great hall, and he standing in the
midst, spoke unto them and said: My brethren, lords, and good friends, the
bond wherein I stand bounden unto you is so great, yt although it has pleased
God to make me Emperor of all Grecia, yet am I well assured, it is far beyond
my poor hability to satisfy you for the same, esteeming the honor and riches
that I now have (next under God) be it little or much, to proceed from you: I
am now threescore years of age, wholly aged and decrepit, by reason of the
pains that in my youthful years I have continually taken in following arms:
so it is I have but one child, which is a daughter, the only staff and hope
of my old years, whom I have determined (if you think good) to give in
marriage unto the valiant knight Esplandian, and with her likewise to inuest
him with the Empire and government of all my countries. And the better to live
solitarily, and to separate my self from worldly company, I have determined to
go (with the Empress my wife) into the monastery that I caused to be made,
there to live religiously, calling upon God and doing penance for the evils I
have committed heretofore. Wherefore my good lords and friends I pray you, if
this my determination like you well, let every man give consent, and you first
(said he unto king Amadis) to whom the matter touches nearer then to any of
the rest, as being father and son. My lord (said he) my son shall do as you
command him. I will tell you, (said the Emperor) I remember that among other
Prophesies which ought to happen in this our time, there is one that makes me
(as I think) agree with you in one consent. Esplandian has upon his body (as I
have understood) certain carracters, which show his name and others that in no
wise can be read, but only by the woman that is ordained to be his wife, let us
now see if it be my daughter or not: with that he sent for the Princess
Leonorine, who being brought thither by the Empress and diverse other ladies,
the Emperor desired Esplandian to open his doublet and show them the letters
he had borne upon his body from his mothers womb, which he refused not, but
before them all showed them openly, where every man might easily perceive the
white carracters, containing this word Esplandian, but they could not know the
red: wherefore the Emperor caused his daughter to come near, asking her what
she could do therein. My lord (said she) not long before Melie betrayed
Vrganda, she and I being alone in my chamber, she sent to fetch one of the
books that had been taken from her, covered with gold, whereon the
Enchauntresse was engraven, and I remember that I saw therein the like
carracters that Esplandian bears on his body, and over them their
signification, which is nothing else but his name and mine. Daughter (said the
Emperor) if you have the book still, cause it to be brought hither: whereunto
she obaied. The book being brought, she showed him the place that Melie had
read unto her, containing that which follows: The happy knight yt shall
conquer the sword and the great treasure inchaunted by me, shall from his
mothers womb bear his name in white carracters, and the name of her that shall
be his wife in red carracters upon his body, which red carracters shall be so
difficult to understand, yt no man living in that time how wife or learned
soever he be, shall express the same without he see this book, which will
teach him what the seven carracters do signify, representing the seven words
that follow, Leonorine daughter of the Emperor of Greece. In good faith (said
the Emperor) here is a strange case, and shows well yt the Enchantresse lady
had more knowledge in art Magic, then any yt lived in her time: and seeing my
daughter has so well deuined, I am determined that you, (said he unto the
archbishop of Thrace) do grant unto Esplandian that which nature before his
birth had promised unto him, which is my daughter Leonorine. By which means
the marriage was solemnised and finished the same day with no great ceremonies,
the Court being as yet troubled for the death of so many Princes and great
lords that were slain in the battle: but let it suffice to know, that those
two lovers enjoyed the thing which they so long desired, Esplandian the same
day being proclaimed Emperor of Greece according to the commandment of his
father in law: who within two months after, with the Empress his wife went
unto a monastery and place of devotion. And because queen Calafre had always
pretended to marry with Esplandian, perceauing her intent frustrated, she could
not refrain to speak in presence of the^ all, and said unto them: My lords, I
beseech you give me leave to declare my mind. It is certain (said she) yt those
which know me are not ignorant yt I am one of the greatest and most puissant
princess in all the cast parts, by reason of the great quantity of gold and
precious stones yt are within my countries. As touching my lineage; I am
daughter of a queen of ancient race, and as noble as any yt ever was in the
world: so it is that fortune brought me into these marches, promising me
shortly to return laden with great number of fla^es and abundance of treasure:
but to the contrary, I yt pretended and sought the captivity of others, and my
self taken and better holden prisoner the^ they yt ^^ in their mortal enemies
hands. This imprisonment whereof I speak, is not yt whereunto I am bound by the
faith I have given unto king Amadis, having vanquished me by force, which I
certainly know to be wholly subject to fortune: but the imprisonment whereof
(...) complain, is ye wherein my heart has enclosed it self, and has ye only
moving by ye sole beauty and favor I have found in ye new and most happy
emperor esteeming my self to be such, yt I haued (leaving my law to accept of
yours) to have had him for my lord and husband, although my hope by little and
little began to deminish, when I perceived the Princes Leonorine to be more
recommended in all perfections then any that ever I heard of, or ever have
seen: so that (speaking against my self) it had been impossible to find a
more equal match nor more conformable one unto the other, then the marriage of
them together: which makes me believe that fortune extends wholly to eternise
this my passion, wherein I will (if I can) so much impeach her, that forgetting
my first affection, and if it will please him to give me another husband worthy
my estate, I will accept it willingly together with baptism and the law of
Christ which you do hold. When the Emperor Esplandian saw her good pretense,
he began to comfort her in the best manner he could, and calling Talanque (a
fair lusty and well disposed Gentleman) he said unto the Queen: Madame, this
Gentleman I offer unto you, is my cousin, and son unto King Galaor, one of ye
best knights as I think living in the world, I pray you at my request refuse
him not for your lord and husband, assuring you, that I know no Princess (how
great soever she be) living in the world, but might content her self with him.
The Queen beheld him with so good affection, that she easily believed
Esplandian, and said unto him: Upon your word my lord I will accept of him, and
from this time forward yield my self to be his wife, and will for his sake
do so much, yt the Island wherein I and others my predecessors would not suffer
a man to live, shall from henceforth be governed by him as other countries are
by their Kings and Princes. And because her sister Li^^e was not at that
assembly, but with her ships lying in the straights (as Queen Calafre had
commanded her as you heard before) she desired the Emperor to send for her,
who presently sent the admiral Tartarie to fetch her, she being come, and
having heard her sisters mind, easily agreed thereto, and by the same means
was married to Manely the wise, both espoused at one time, and being baptized,
caused all their army to do the like: which done, not long after those new
married couples, taking their leaves of the Kings, Princes, Lords, Ladies, and
Gentlewomen of the Court, they embarked themselves, Manely having with him the
vessels wherein Childadan his father arrived in the east, and Talanque those of
king Galaor, which they caused to be sraighted and laden with all things
necessary for so strange a country. And setting sail for Californie, not
without great trouble, (which in the end they overcame) they arrived in safety,
where afterward they had many battles with their neighbors bordering about
them, whom they overcame, augmenting their dominions with many great lands and
territories. But because the subject of our history is not further to entreat
of them, we will for this present leave the^ to go on with yt which afterward
was done in the city of Constantinople. You heard before of the love of
Norandel and queen Minoresse, yt daily increased in the^ more and more, which
the Empress knowing full well, caused them to be married together, the emperor
giving to Norandel the castle La montaigne defendu, with the towns of Alfarin
and Galatia, for the which he recompensed Frandalo with the rich, fertile and
well peopled isle's of Galatines. Mean time the Emperor Esplandian not
forgetting the imprisonment of Vrganda, one day among the rest (not long before
the princes of the West embarked themselves to return into their countries) he
showed the^ in what sort Melie had taken her away, and by enchantment carried
her to the great city of Tesifant, where she held her prisoner in a great
tower, desiring them most earnestly to give him counsel what he might do
therein. Son (said king Amadis) it were good you sent unto Armato to offer him
for her the souldan of Liquie yt is your prisoner: and if he refuse you so to
do, we will enter into his country and fetch her thence by force. Whereunto
they all agreed, so yt without longer delay Carmelle was sent to Tesifant,
imbarking her self with four squires and three gentlewome^, and with a good
wind arrived at ye castle La montaigne defendu, where she remained certain
days, staying for king Armatos pasport which by one of her women she sent to
fetch, who fou^^ Armato as melancholy as might be, feeling as yet his fortune
past, specially the death of his son Alphorax, which without ceasing he
continually lamented. With yt the gentlewoman gave him to understand ye cause
of her arriual, wherewith he was so well pleased, that presently he caused
Carmelles safe conduct to be made, and giving it to the messenger, said unto
her: My friend, return unto your mistress and assure her from me, yt she
may come unto my court as often as it pleases her, remembering well the
pleasures she showed unto me during my imprisonment. The gentlewoma^ thanked
him most heartily, and returned to Carmelle: who within few days after went to
Tesifant to Armato, where she declared at large the effect of her embassage,
which heard by king Armato and considring with himself, yt for Vrganda he
might recover one of his greatest friends and thereby cause the Christian
Princes for a time to refrain the ouerrunning of his country, sent presently
for Melie, desiring her in all affection (for his sake) to grant to his desire
and the pleasure of the Christians, considring the offer made by the^ was both
advantage unto him and his. Melie desirous to please Armato, brake her
enchantments, and without delay Vrganda was delivered unto Carmelle, upon
condition, yt she being arrived in the city of Constantinople, should likewise
set the Souldan of Liquie at liberty, which she swore and promised to do: which
done, taking their leave of Armato, they traveled so long, yt they came unto
the castle La montaigne defendu, where Vrganda caused the^ to leave Carmelles
ship to enter into the great serpent that as yet she found there, which
presently of it self began to sail, as it had always done before Vrganda was
in prison, in such manner, that without impeachment they arrived in the Haven
of Constantinople, where the Princes and lords being on shore, descended to
the water side to receive Vrganda: And thinking to bring her to the palace,
she desired the to stay there til a prophecy were accomplished, yt should be
done before the sun went down, which they agreed unto: not only to please her
mind, but likewise desiring to see what it should be. With that they were
abashed that the great serpent began to leap and labor in the water; as if it
had been in the greatest storm yt ever was, although the sea was very calm, but
only about ye serpent, where it raged in most horrible manner, but yt which most
abashed the beholders was, that the vessel cast forth such horrible cries, yt
not one among them but his hair stood upright upon his head for fear. And
having continued in yt manner about (...) more* the serpent thrust his head into
ye water, wherewith it sunk and never was seen again. And with that they
perceived a far off a great rock, which being driven by the waves, came
within half a bow shot near unto the shore, on ye top whereof stood a woman
bareheaded, and covered only with a linen cloth to hide her priuities, being
inuironned by more then a thousand serpents as well great as small, which stung
her in such sort, yt she wept and lamented in most pitiful manner, whereat the
knights of great Britain had so much compassion, yt they thought to enter
into the ships, and go to help her: which Vrganda forbad them. For (said she)
besides the dangers that may happen unto you you shall lose your labors, because
she whom you behold (which is the inchauntresse lady) has ordained it to be
so. With yt the rock sunk into the water, and the gentlewoman vanished out of
sight, but not long after she appeared again upon ye waves, flying from the
fury of a monster of the sea, yt with his throat open followed after, ready to
devour her, in such manner, that she came right unto the haven, crying with a
loud voire unto Esplandian: Gentle Emperor I pray you help me, for none but you
can do it: wherewith Esplandian stepped forward, and holding the sword he
conquered in the old palace of the inchaunted rock in his hand, ran unto her,
and thinking to go near the monster, the gentlewoman yt fled from it caught
hold of his sword, and whether he would or not took it away, wherewith she threw
her self into the sea, and the monster after her. Whereat every man began to
laugh, saying to the emperor, that if a gentlewoman had predestined the same
unto him, and kept it long time, another gentlewoman or she her self upon a
sudden had taken it from him again. With yt Vrganda was led unto the
palace, accompanied by the emperor with all ye kings and knights: where not
long after the Souldan of Liquie was delivered and sent to Tesifant, and about
the beginning of the next week after the western princes took shipping: and
being embarked with Vrganda (recommending ye emperor to God) failed forwards,
till at ye last every man arrived at his desired haven, namely king Amadis that
found Oriane very sad for ye death of her mother newly deceased, which much
more increased when she knew her father king Luisart was dead. But in the end,
time made her to forget her sorrow, but not so soon as Amadis could have wished.

CHAP. LV. How the Emperor Esplandian sent Norandel to take possession of the
country he had given him, and of the taking of Tesifant.
NOt long after the western princes were departed into their countries, the
emperor Esplandian would that Norandel should go unto the castle La montaigne
defendu, and other towns that he had given him, to make war against king
Armato, for which cause he gave him a great number of soldiors, with the which
to make short he assailed the king of Turkey, and had battle together, wherein
many a valiant knight lost their lives: nevertheless, the victory fell on
Norandels side, whereby he caused Armato to fly away, retiring to his city of
Tesifant, which being known unto the Emperor, he departed from Constantinople,
and with a great army going into Turkey, joined with Norandels power, and
besieged Tesifant, but fear seized so well upon Armato, yt he found means to
fly away and leave ye town, which not long after was taken, and the princess
Heliaxe brought unto the emperor, who used her courteously, and sent her again
unto her father Ampheon king of Medea, giving her diverse rich presents. News
being spread throughout the country of Turkey of the flight of king Armato, as
also of the taking of Tesifant, diverse towns and cities yielded to Esplandian,
that gave them likewise to Norandel: and because winter came on, he returned
into Thrace, where two of his nephews, sons of Galaor came to visit him,
and to receive the order of knighthood: which he gave unto them with both armor
and horses, minding to request them to travel to Tesifant unto Norandel,
thereto begin their first entrance into arms, but they desired rather to take
ye way to Californie, where M^^^ and Ta^anque had great war against their
neighbors, which ye emperor perceiving caused al things necessary for so long a
voyage to be given them, with so good Pilote^, that in the end they arrived at
their desired Haven, where they attained to great honor and estimation among
their ^pan^ But (...) to enter further to discou^^ of them, (...) this present
let them rest. And let it suffice you to know* how that as time passed, Perion
succeeded in his fathers feat, and Garinter married in the east parts with
Heletria queen of Citharee, and was the best knight in all the world. And
because it is declared at large in the sixth and seventh books of this our
historye, we will pass it over at this time.

CHAP. LVI. How Vrganda sent to desire king Amadis, the Emperor Esplandian, Don
Galaor king of Sobradise, and others, to come unto the Firm Isle, and of the
marvelous inchauntments that she made over the^.
VRganda being in her Isle not as yet discovered, taking great pleasure to read
Melies books, knew by her art death to be near unto the kings and princes
whom she most loved, and having great sorrow that worms should consume the
flesh of so valiant king hes, devised to prevent ye same, which to do she took
sea, accompanied of her two cousins Iuliande, and Solisee, with diverse other
gentlewomen, and went unto the Firm Isle, where being arrived, she sent to the
emperor Esplandian, Amadis, Galaor, Florestan, Agraies, and Gransador, praying
them most earnestly to come unto her to the palace of Apolidon, for matter yt
touched the^ most near, otherwise she sent the^ word, if they did it not, yt
before long time past evil would happen unto the^, and ye master Elizabeth
should bring with him the book yt he made of the adventures of the knights
living in his time, as also yt they should bring their wives with Ardan the
dwarf, Carmelle, Gandalin, and the Gentlewoman of Denmark. Those princes
having understood Vrgandas mind, failed not therein, so that about ye same time
she willed the^ to come, they all arrived there: where Vrganda received them,
not with a smiling coun^^nance as ^^er used ordinary to do, but with tears in
her eyes, whereat they being much abashed, desired her to show the cause
thereof, which at the first she could not do, her heart was so full of greet.
Nevertheless, in the (...) she too^^ (...) again* and said unto them: My
good friends, (...) of almighty God, al things have (...) temporal things
should pass away, and by death have an end, according to the qualities of his
creatures: Which diverse great persons considering with themselves, have
travailed (during their lives) in many sorts, after their deaths to leave some
memory of them, not minding to bury their renown together with their bodies.
Now I know for certain that the end of your days is near: wherefore it is
most requisite, that you be constant, and show your selves to be the same you
were at the beginning. Nevertheless before that death shall seize upon you, I
will show the love that I have always borne unto you, and with the help of
God, will do so much, that without death you shall remain asleep, until the
time that one descended of your race shall deliver you from thence, and after
that shall be in as good case and reign again within your countries as you
did before: otherwise assure your selves that before six months do come unto
an end, not one of you shall be alive, but all buried in the earth. Wherefore
let every man show me his opinion, and for the rest (said she) let me provide.
Surely that speech and news of death was so hard for them to endure, that not
one of them but changed color, their hearts being seized with an extreme
sorrow. And as they beheld each other, king Amadis seeming least astonished,
answered unto Vrganda and said: Madame, we know for certain, that not one of
us, nor any other living creature can perfectly know what is necessary for
us, but only you alone: wherefore do with us as you think good, and we will
all obey you: that is sufficient (said Vrganda) therefore let every man put on
his armor in the same manner he uses when he goes to the field, and each
man hold his sword naked in his hand: that done, she caused them to go into
the forbidden chamber, setting them in their royal seats, with all their
wives by them: which done, Vrgandas two cousens, Iuliande and Solisde in two
basins of gold brought a certain composition, wherewith she desired them to
wash their faces, which they did. Whereby it happened, that on a sudden
Beauty (which Age and Time had decayed in them) began again to appear within
their faces, in as great perfection a^ even it had done: which adventure
please^ the Ladies so ^^ll that they began to behold each other, and their
husbands thereat to be much abashed. Then Vrganda called master Elizabeth, and
taking him by the hand, led him into the next chamber, where she caused him to
sit down, and putting the book that he had brought into her hands, she made
signs to Gandalin and the gentlewoman of Denmark that they should follow her:
and passing through the Arc of faithful lovers they entered into the garden,
where the images of Apolidon and Grimanaise were placed: over the which she set
them and Ardan the dwarf hard by them, wherewith she said unto them: My
friends, the true and faithful lovers have been worthy to see these images
before the Arc sometime enchanted, so you deserve this place for the faith and
true and affection that you have always borne to your masters. Wherefore upon
your lives, see you depart not hence whatsoever you shall hear or see: that
done, she went unto the chamber where she left the Emperor, and taking
Carmelle by the hand, before them all she said unto her: Carmelle, you were but
of mean parentage, but the virtue and great courtesy of your heart has so
much enabled you, that you shall be placed at the Emperors feet to fulfill the
promise made unto him, which was, never to forsake him while you lived. With
that she spoke unto king Amadis and all the other princes, praying them not to
fly till she returned again: and going up into one of the towers of the
palace, she took with her the best of Medeas books which Melie had, that
sometime belonged to the Enchantresse lady: and being in the tower she
uncovered her head, with that she began to read certain coniu^^ations, and
looking into all the four quarters of the earth, making signs and tokens with
her fingers, her face became so read. that it seemed fire had issued out of
her eyes. Whereupon there ^appened such an earthquake and so great tempests of
lightning and ^hunder, as though the Elements had fought together. This tempest
continuing for the space of three quarters of an hour, those whom she had
caused to sit down (as you heard before) remained in a trance without all
knowledge, as if they had been dead: and with that there appeared a cloud so
obscure and thick which environed the place, that never after it could be
seen, till Luisart of Greece son to Esplandian brought that enchantment to an
end, by means of a sword which he conquered, as it shall be declared to you in
the sixth Book: wherein is described one of the most pleasant and delectable
histories that ever was read. At which time all the Princes and the rest were
revived again, and not before. The Emperor Esplandian at that time had a son
after his grandfathers name called Luisart, as then about the age of eight
years: King Amadis a son and a daughter, the son named Perion, and the
daughter Brisene that married the eldest son of the Emperor of Rome: King
Galaor two sons, the one named Perion, the other Garinter, of whom I have
showed you before: Florestan the King of Sardaigne two sons, the one named
Florestan after his father, that reigned after him, and the other Palmindan of
Almaine after his grandfather: Agrayes Earl of Salandrie two sons, the one
called Languines, the other Galmenes: King Bruneau one son named Vallade, and
a daughter named Helisenne that married Quedragants son, and bare his fathers
name: King Childadan two sons, the eldest called Abies of Ireland after his
grandfather, whom Amadis slew the first day he entered into Knighthood. And
although these princes left such heirs as you heard before, yet would they not
during their fathers absence, take on them the names or titles of Kings, hoping
by Gods help, that they should once return as well as ever they were. For the
which cause they having ^^^tained to the age and strength to bear arms, passed
(...) ^reland, there to be made knights by King Child^^^^ (...) very weak and
withered with age: (...) followed strange adventures, doing many (...) feats
of arms, which are at large declared in the books that follow, which in time
may come unto your hands, when it pleases God.

FINIS.
