C HONT SOIT ^EVI MA^Y PENSE
seal R BY THE SVPREAME COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLICS OF IRELAND
THE deep sense Which we have of the sadd condition, the Kingdom is at
present reduced unto, by the unadvised proceedings of some Prelates Secular and
Regular, and of some superiors of Regular orders in this Kingdom, together
with our just fears, that unless a timely course be taken to stopp the
violence of those unwarrantable ways, the whole body of the Confederats may
run irrecouerable hazard; These with the conscience of doing an act most
Religious, by safeguarding innocence (though noe common danger were suspected)
moved us, to reflect on the duty we owe to the public, and on the straight
tie which the oath of Association binds us unto, for its preservation, for
discharge of our duty in both, and stopping the current of evils which we
sadly behold flowing out of this source (though the laws both divine and
natural edge us to use all extremity in bussines of so great concernment,
whereon the safety and lives of the whole nation depends) yet being unwilling
to fix on any course which might seem harsh (even to the offenders themselves)
we thought good, first to admonish and desire all and every the said Prelates
of what degree soever, Arch Bushopps, Bushopps, Abbots, vicars Generals,
Deanes, and Chapters, Prouincialls, Priors, Guardians and all other superiors,
coniuring them by the sacred bond of the oath of Association, and strictly
charging them, on their due allegiance to his Majesty, his Crown, his
Kingdom, and unto us as Supreme Council of the Confederat Catholics, that
they shall in noe wise molest any of their respective subjects, Priests or
Religious, for perseuering in their loyalty or (in pursuance thereof) for
approving the late Cessation made by us with the Lord Barron of Insiquin, and
that they shall not command, solicit, desire, or induce, by word, writing,
or deed, publicly or privately, any of their said subjects to oppose the said
Cessation, or any other our just Commands, in pursuance of it, for the public
safety, or to infuse into the people any disobedience to our authority, upon
any pretense whatsoever, even of the declaration made or Censures now issued,
or hereafter to be issued by the Lord Nuncio, and his four Bushopps on the
same ground, From all which [as both groundless and unlawful) we have
(according to the rule of sacred Canons,) legally appealed to his Holiness, and
by that our address, not only suspended the past sentences and Censures, but
also his Graces whole jurisdiction, and the said four Bushopps (if any they
had) from proceeding any further therein, until his Holiness pleasure be
known.

AND furthermore, we require (by virtue of the said Oath, and upon their
allegiance) all inferiors of both Cleargies, Dignitaries Curats, Preachers,
Confessors, and all others, of what condition soever they be, that they shall
not, on any pretense [euen of the said Gensurs) withdraw any Confederat from
approving the said Cessation, or obeying our orders and Decrees, made and to be
made, in pursuance thereof, but rather endeavor, in their public sermons,
private Conferences, and upon each occasion offered, to confirm them in their
allegiance to his Majesty, and our just decrees and orders.

BESIDES, We thought it most necessary and just, to receive (as we do by
these, and from this instant) into the special, and immediate protection of the
Crown and of his Majesty (the administration of whose rights, even in this
particular, is in our hands toward the Confederat Catholics) all Churchmen
both Secular and Regular, of what degree soever, who hitherto have declared
themselves faithful and obedient to the Government of the Kingdom, and who
have therefore, and for opposeing sinister and Dangerous practices against us,
and such as are in authority, been heretofore, are for the present, or shall
hereafter be persecuted by their superiors, vexed, hindered, suspended,
deprived or any way molested; Protesting and publishing to the world, that we
will use all the extent of our power to suppress and defend their innocence
herein, against the Lord Nuncio and such their Superiors, until his
Holiness and General Superiors of Instituts (being sufficiently informed)
provide further, for the affairs of the Church, and duediscipline of Regular
orders in Ireland.

LASTLY, we Declare unto the said Prelates and Superiors, and likewise unto all
inferiors of either Clergy, that if henceforth any Churchmen be found
seduceing the people as aforesaid, or countenancing, either seducers, or the
seduced, we must, and Will presently upon notice given, proceed against such,
as enemies of the common good, and injurious to the Government, the suddainess
and greatness of the present fatal dangers necessitating us thereunto.

HENCE it is, that none is to conceive, we intend hereby (since both are per
viam facti, and for our natural and necessary defense, in assumeing into our
protection the unjustly oppressed Ecclesiastics) to vsurp an illegal power,
jurisdiction, or unwarrantable prerogative, or to entrench upon the immunities
of the Church, being so far from either, as we are certain, our decree in
all, and every the aforesaid perticulars, does not swerve from the square of
sacred Canons, from the consent of great Divines and Canonists, from the
practice of most Catholic Nations (and amongst the rest of England before the
schism without controulement of the Clergy) nay we are undoubtedly possessed,
the law of nature (which is aboueall Cannons) does approve and Command it so
strictly, as we cannot otherwise answer the trust reposed in us, when by our
negligence herein, the lives and fortunes of the Confederat Catholics would
be exposed to most inevitable and evident danger. Given at Kilkenny Castle, the
third day of June 1648. and in the Four and twentieth year of the Reign of
our Sovereign Lord CHARLES By the Grace of God, King of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland.
