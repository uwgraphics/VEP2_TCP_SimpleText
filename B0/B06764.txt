(...) Warning-piece to England, against Pride and Wickedness, being the Fall
of Queen Eleanor, Wife to Edward the First, King of England; who for her Pride
and GOD's Judgments, sunk into the Ground at Charing-cr^s, and rose at
Queen-hith.
To the Tune of, Gentle and Cou^teous.


WHen Edward was in England King,
the First of all that name,
Proud Elenor he made his Queen,
a stately Span^sh Dame:
Whose wicked Life and sinful ^ride,
through England did excel,
To dainty Dames and gallant Maids,
this Queen was known full well:
She was the first that did invent
in Coaches brave to ri^e
She was the first that brought this Land
to deadly Sin of Pride:
No English Tailor here to (...) serve
to make her rich Attire,
But sent for Tailors into Spain,
to feed her vain desire.
They brought in Fashions strange and new,
with Golden Garments bright;
The Farthingale and mighty Ruff,
with Gowns of rich Delight:
You London Dames in Spanish Pride,
did flourish everywhere;
Our English Men like Woman then;
did wear long Locks of Hair.
Both Man and Child both Maid and Wife,
were drowned in Pride of Spain,
And thought the Spanish Tailors then
our English Men did stain:
Whereat the Queen did much dispight,
to see our English Men
In Vestures clad, as brave to see
as any Spaniard they.
She craved the King, That every man
that wo^e long Locks of Hair,
Might then be cut and polled all,
or shaved very near.
Whereat the King did seem content,
and soon thereto agreed,
And first commente^ that his own
sho^l^ then be cut with speed.
And after that, to please his Queen,
proclaimed through the Land,
That every Man that wore long Hair,
should pol^ him out of hand:
But yet this Spaniard not content,
to Woman bore a spite,
And then requested of the King,
against all Law and Right,
That every Womankind should have
their right Breast cut a way,
And then with burning Irons seared,
the blood to stanch and stay!
King Edward turn perc^ving well,
her spite to Womankind,
Devised soon by policy,
and turned her bloody mind,
He sent for burning Irons straight,
all sparkling ho^ to see,
And (...) Que^n, come on thy way,
I will be in with thee.
Which words did much displease the Queen,
that Penance to begin,
But asked the Pardon on her knees,
who gave her Grace therein.
But afterward she chanced to pass
(...) London streets,
Whereas the ^ayo^ of London's Wife,
in stately sort she m^^ts;
With Music, Mirth and Melody,
unto the Church they w^nt,
To give God Thanks that to the L. Mayor
a noble Son had sent.
It grieved much (...) spightful Queen,
to see that any one,
Should so exceed in Mirth and Joy,
except herself alone;
For which she after did devise,
within her bloody mind,
And practiced still most secretly,
to kill this Lady kind:
Unto the Mayor of London then,
she sent her Letters straight,
To send his Lady to the Court,
upon her Grace to wait;
But when the London Lady came
before proud Elenor's face,
She str^pt her from her rich Array,
and kept her vile and base.
She sent her into Wales with speed,
and kept her secret there,
And used her still most cruelly,
that ever Man did hear:
She made her wash, she made her starch,
she made her drudge always,
She made her nurse up Children small,
and labor night and day.
But this contented not the Queen,
but showed her most dispight,
She bound this Lady to a Post,
at twelve a clock at Night;
And as poor Lady she stood bound,
the Queen in angry mood,
Did set two Snakes unto her Breast,
that sucked away her blood.
Thus dyed the Mayor of London's Wife,
most grievous for to hear,
Which made the Spaniard grow more proud,
as after shall appear:
The Wheat that daily made her Bread,
was bolted twenty times,
The Food that fed this stately Dame,
was boly'd in costly Wines;
The Water that did spring from Ground,
she would not touch at all,
But washed her hands with Dew of Heaven,
that on sweet Roses fall;
She bathed her body many a time,
in Fount ins^fill'd with Milk,
And every day did change Attire,
in costly Median Silk.
But coming then to London back,
within her Coach of Gold,
A Tempest strange within the Skies,
this Queen did there behold;
Out of which Storm she could not go,
but there remained a space,
Four Horses could not stir the Coath
a foot out of the place.
A Judgment lately sent from Heaven,
for shedding guiltless Blood,
Upon this sinful Queen, that slew
the London Lady good:
King Edward then, as Wisdom wis^'d,
accused her of that Deed;
But she denied, and wished that God
would send his Wrath with speed.
If that upon so vile a thing,
her heart did ever think,
She wished the Ground might open wide
and she therein might sink;
With that, at Charing Cross she sunk
into the Ground alive,
And after rose with Life again,
in London, at Queen-hith.
When after that she languisht sore
full twenty days in pain,
At last confessed the Lady's Blood,
her guilty hand had slain;
And likewise how that by a Fry^r,
she had a base-born Child,
Whose sinful Lusts and Wickedness.
her Marriage Bed defiled,
Thus have you heard the Fell of Prid^,
a just Reward of Sin,
For those that will forswear themselve;
God's vengeance daily win;
Beware of Pride, ye Courtly Dames,
both Wives and Maidens all,
Bear this imprinted in your mind,
That PRIDE must have a Fall.
