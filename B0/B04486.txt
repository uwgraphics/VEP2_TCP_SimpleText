News out of the Strand, OR, The Brewers Misfortune.
Being a true relation of a London Brewer, who was taken by his own Wife and
the constable, in bed with two strapping Lasses both at once, he lying in the
middle, and they on each side. This was done near Covent Garden on monday the
seventh day of this present July, 1662. about one of the clock in the morning;
the manner how, is more fully expressed in this following Ditty.

To the Tune of, Come my own Dear let us dally a while.


COme listen a while and I Will tell you a jest,
with a fa, la, la, la, la lero,
There Is nothing but truth in my Ditty expressed,
with a fa, la, la, la, la lero.
It Is of a Ranting Brewer which,
Was troubled with a leacherous Itch
And wanted a Whore to cool his breech,
with a fa, la, la, la, la, lero.
To be a Whore-monger he was known,
with a fa, la, etc.
And yet he had a sweet Wife of his own,
with a fa, la, etc.
He had good-Ale enough in his own Fat,
And Flesh in his house, yet what of that
The Brewer must have a fresh bit for his Cat,
with a fa, la, etc.
Sure he in lust did exceedingly burn,
with a fa, etc.
That no less than two could serve his turn,
with a fa, etc.
If that be true that one Whore can foil,
Ten men in an hour and make them recoyle,
I fear these two wenches the Brewer did spoil,
with a fa, etc.
But that which to many does seem very strange,
with a fa, etc.
These Doxies belonged unto the Exchange,
with a fa, etc.
The Brewer being in great care.
How for his money, to get good ware.
The new Exchange sifted him to a hair,
with a fa, etc.
This Brewer was none of your Idle Drones,
with fa, etc.
For he could please two wenches at once,
with a fa etc.
He Would need be wary that deals with such,
For they will be very apt to grutch,
If one has too little and to'ther too much,
with a fa la, etc.
These Lasses were none of the ordinary sort
with a fa, la, etc.
But stately young Girls who were used to the sport,
with a fa, la, etc.
They knew the Brewer to be a brave Lad,
Who freely would give to make them glad
A draught of the sweetest wort that he had,
with a fa la, etc.
The second part
to the same Tune.


O Was not this a wonderful Riddle,
with a fa, la, etc.
Two whores in the Bed, and a knave in the middle,
with a fa la, etc.
But though 'twas odds yet he did not fail,
To please both the wenches (tooth and nail)
His courage was raised with a Cup of good A^e
with a fa, etc.
Yet mark how at last this Brewer did fare,
with a fa la, etc.
His Wife caught him napping, as Moss caught his Mare,
with a fa la, etc.
She did suspect him long before
Because he used to Rant and Roar,
But now she resolved she would find out his Whore,
with a fa la, etc.
And having notice of the place,
with a fa la, etc.
Where he his Lasses did embrace,
with a fa, la, etc.
To follow him thither she was not afraid
Because she had the Constable's aid
And thus the poor Brewer was betrayed,
with a fa la, etc.
On monday morning by one of the clock,
with a fa la, etc.
At the first crowing of the Cock,
with a fa la, etc.
She stepped into the Room with a light,
Which to the whores was a terrible sight
And did the Brewer most sorely affright,
With a fa la, etc.
There she beheld unto her grief
with a fa la, etc.
That these two Lasses had played the thief,
with a fa la, etc.
For being in her Husbands lay,
They went so often to the best Tap,
That she at home could get never a drop,
with a fa la, etc.
But now she good wife will make them both sure,
with a fa, la, etc
From being henceforth so bold with the Brewer,
with a fa la, etc.
They did consume her husbands gains,
And drank up the Ale whilst she fed on the grains,
It Is fit that they should be well paid for their pains
with a fa la, etc.
Into the round-house these Lasses were put,
with a fa la, etc.
A fitting place for each impudent slut,
with a fa la, etc.
Hereafter let them have a care,
How to a Brewer they sell their ware,
For fear that Bridewell fall to their share,
with a fa la, etc.
I cannot tell how they will speed all at last,
with a fa la, la, la, la lero,
But sure I am, the worst is not past,
with a fa la, la, la, la, lero.
The Brewer should have been more w^se,
And ^ept further off his wenches thighs
For now he will be made to pay double Excise,
with a fa la, la, la, la, lero.
FINIS.
