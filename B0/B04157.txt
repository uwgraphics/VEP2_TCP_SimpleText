(...) good (...) King and Commonwealth.
For all the Merchants that with Lead does trade,
And Minors, I these Verses here have made,
For their sweet pleasure mi^ch, and great delight,
I took the pains these Verses to indite,
But my good will to King and Country here
To all true subjects plainly shall appear.
To the Tune of, The Dukes wish, or i will ask no more.




MInors of Minervals where e're you be
You Lead Merchants that Trade by Sea
From the Store,
Low down a while and give Ear to me
And he ask no more,
I would have a Grove with Ore quick
With a (...)ib of Ore thirty foor thick,
That Is great store,
That would yield me ten Thousand Load a Week
And, etc.
This Ore i would have does sole and stool
Or else you would count me an unwise fool,
Of Wit poor,
And Wind my Workmens heat to cool,
And, etc.
This Ore I Would have from Water free,
To the depth of Seventy seven and three
That Is fourscore,
And Ten Thousand yards of length to be
And, etc.




THen would I build up stately Toes
And would possess my ground with Stoes,
All Men before,
So that no Ranglers could me oppose,
And i would ask no more.
Then Lead I would desire to see(...)
At fifty pound a fodder to be,
And never Lower,
Likewise all Trading good to be,
And, etc.
And then I would desire to see
Each man worth fifty pound to be;
None in(...) have poor,
And to live in peace and Unity,
And, etc.
Likewise I would desire to see
Two sons born to his Majesty,
Them i would adore,
And the Crown worn by the Heir to be
And, etc.
And then a Bride I Would take to me,
A Virgin pure I Would have her to be,
Her I Would adore,
And one to be come of honesty,
And, etc.
Then if Fortune of us smiled
I Would have her to conceive with child,
Her death before,
And to be delivered of two Sons meek and mild
And, etc.
My Sons I would bring my so well
With learning high for to excel
Ten thousand score,
And to obey the true Gospel
And etc.
My Heir I would desire to see
Chief Counselor to His Majesty
My death before,
And the Youngest Chief Admiral of the Sea
And, etc.
Then i would desire the true Gospel
Might increase and among us ovvel,
They are finners poor,
And then our Souls by Christ to be freed from Hell,
Then i would ask no more.
