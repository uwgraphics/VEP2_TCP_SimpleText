An Ordinance and Declaration of the LORDS and COMMONS in PARLIAMENT.
WHereas the King seduced by wicked Counsel has raised an Army; and leavied
War against the Parliament, and great number of Forces are daily raised under
the commands of Papists and other ill-affected persons, by Commissions from His
Majesty; And whereas diverse Delinquents are protected from public Justice by
his Majesty's Army, and sundry outrages and rapines are daily committed by the
Soldiers of the said Army, who have no respect to the Laws of God or the
Land, but burn and plunder the Houses, and seize and destroy the persons and
goods of diverse His Majesty's good Subjects; And whereas for the maintenance of
the said Army diverse assessements are made upon several Counties, and His
Majesty's Subjects are compelled by the Soldiers to pay the same; which said
Army if it should continue, would soon ruin and wast the whole Kingdom, and
overthrow Religion, Law, and Liberty. For suppressing of which said Army and
ill-affected persons, there is no probable way under God, but by the Army
raised by authority of the Parliament; which said Army so raised, cannot be
maintained without great sums of Money, yet for raising such sums, by
reason of His Majesty's withdrawing Himself from the advice of the Parliament,
there can be no Act of Parliament passed with His Majesty's assent, albeit
there is great Justice that the said Moneys should be raised. The Lords and
Commons in Parliament, having taken the same into their serious consideration,
and knowing that the said army so raised by them, has been hitherto for the
most part maintained by the voluntary contribution of diverse well-affected
persons, who have freely contributed according to their abilities.

But considering there are diverse others within the Cities of London and
Westminster, and the Suburbs of the same, and also within the Borough of
Southwarke, that have not contributed at all toward the maintenance of the
said army, or if they have, yet not answerable to their Estates, who
notwithstanding receive benefit and protection by the same army, as well as any
others, and therefore it is most just, that they should as well as others be
charged to contribute to the maintenance thereof.

Be it therefore Ordained by the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, and
by authority thereof; that Isaac Pennington Lord Major of the City of London,
Sir John Wollaston Knight and Alderman, Alderman Towes, Alderman Warner,
Alderman Andrews, Alderman Chambers, Alderman Fowkes, Sir Thomas Seham Knight
and Alderman, Samuel Vassell, John Venn, Morris Thompson, and Richard Warrin,
Citizens, or any four of them, shall hereby have power and authority to
nominate, and appoint in every ward within the City of London, six such
Persons as they, or any four of them, shall think fit, which said six so
nominated, or any four of them, shall hereby have power to enquire of any that
shall remain, or be within the said several Wards that have not contributed
upon the Propositions of both Houses of Parliament, concerning the raising of
Money, Plate, Horse, Horsemen, and arms, for the defense of the King and both
Houses of Parliament, and also of such as are able men, that have contributed,
yet not according to their Estates and abilities. And the said six persons so
nominated, or any four of them within their several and respective wards and
limits, shall have power to assesse such person or persons, as are of ability
and have not contributed, and also such as have contributed, yet not according
to their ability, to pay such sum or sums of Money according to their Estates,
as the said Assessors or any four of them shall think fit and reasonable, so
as the same exceed not the twentieth part of their Estates, and to nominate and
appoint fit persons for the collection thereof. And if any person so assessed
shall refuse to pay the money assessed upon him, it shall be lawful to and for
the said Assessors and Collectors, or any of them, to leavie the said sum so
assessed by way of distress, and sale of the goods of the person so assessed,
and refusing; And if any person so distrained shall make resistance; it shall
be lawful to and for the respective Assessors and Collectors, or any of them,
to call to their assistance any the Trained Bands of the said City of London,
or any other His Majesty's Subjects, who are hereby required to be aiding and
assisting to the said Assessors and Collectors in the premises; And it is
hereby further ordained that the respective. Burgesses of Westminster and
Southwark, together with the several Committees appointed for the
subscriptions of Money, Plate, Horse, Horsemen and Arms within the said City
and Borough, shall respectively have power hereby to nominate Sessors for the
same City and Borough, in such manner as the Lord Mayor, etc. has for the City
of London, and the said Assessors or any four of them, to name Collectors as
aforesaid; Which said Assessors and Collectors shall have the same power
respectively, within their respective limits, as those to be nominated within
the said City of London have hereby limited to them. And for the Suburbs of
London and Westminster, the respective Knights of the Shires where the said
Suburbs are, shall have hereby the like power to name Assessors, and they so
named, or any four of them, and the Collectors by them to be nominated, or any
of them within their respective limits, shall have the like power respectively
as the Assessors and Collectors for London have by virtue of this Ordinance.
And be it ordained that the sums so assessed and levied as aforesaid shall be
paid in at Guild Hall London, to the hands of Sir John Wollastone, Knight, John
Warner, John Towes, and Thomas Andrews Aldermen, or any two of them; And the
Assessors and Collectors to be nominated by virtue hereof shall weekly report
to the Committee of the House of Commons, for the Propositions aforesaid, what
sums of Money have been assessed, and what sums have been levied weekly
according to the purport hereof, and the said moneys so levied and paid in,
shall be issued forth in such sort as the other moneys raised upon the
Propositions aforesaid, and not otherwise.

(...) destroy one another? are the outward blessing only of peace, property,
and liberty, taken, and forced from Our Subjects? are their Consciences free
and unassaulted by the violence of these firebrarnds? Sure the liberty and
freedom of Conscience cannot suffer by these men: Alas! all these punishments
are imposed upon them because they will not submit to Actions contrary to their
natural loyalty, to their Oaths of Allegiance and supremacy, and to their
late, voluntary protestation, which obliges them to the care of Our person and
Our just Rights.

How many persons of Honor, Quality, and Reputation of the several Counties
of England, are now Imprisoned, without any objection against them, but
suspicion of their loyalty? How many of the gravest and most substantial
Citizens of London, by whom the government and discipline of that City was
preserved, are disgraced, robbed, and imprisoned, without any process of Law,
or color of accusation, but of obedience to the Law and Government of the
Kingdom? whilst Anabaptists and Brownists with the assistance of vicious and
deboshed persons, of desperate Fortunes take upon them to break up and rifle
houses, as public and avowed Ministers of a new invented Authority; How many
godly, pious, and painful Divines, whose lives and learning has made them of
Reverend estimation, are now slandered with inclination to popery,
discountenanced, and imprisoned, for discharging their Consciences in
instructing the people in the Christian duty of Religion and Obedience, whilst
Schismatic, Illiterate, and scandalous Preachers, fill the Pulpits and
Churches, with Blasphemy, Irreverence, and Treason, and incite their Auditory
to nothing but Murder and Rebellion; We pass over the vulgar charm, by which
they have captivated such who have been contented to dispense with their
Consciences for the preservation of their estates, and by which they persuade
men cheerfully to part with this twentieth part of their Estate to the good
work in hand, for who-ever will give what he has may escape robbing; They
shall be repaid upon the public faith, as all other Moneys lent upon the
Propositions of both Houses; It may be so, but men must be condemned to a
strange unthriftinesse who will lend upon such security.

The public Faith indeed is as great an earnest as the State can give, and
engages the Honor, Reputation and honesty of the Nation, and is the Act of the
Kingdom, it is the security of the King, the Lords and Commons, which can never
need an Executor, can never dye, never be Bankrupt, and therefore we willingly
consented to it for indemnity of our good Subjects of Scotland, (who we hope
will not think the worse of it, for being so often and so cheaply mentioned
since.) But that a Vote of one or both Houses should be an engagement upon the
public faith, is as impossible, as that the Committee of the House of Commons
for Examinations, should be the High Court of Parliament.

And what is or can be said with the least shadow of reason to justify these
extravagances? We have not lately heard of the old fundamental Laws which
used to warrant the Innovations, this needs a Refuge even below those
foundations: They will say they cannot manage their great undertakings without
such extraordinary ways; We think so too, but that proves only they have
undertaken somewhat they ought not to undertake, not that it is lawful for
them to do any thing that is convenient for those ends: We remembered them long
ago, and we cannot do it too often, of that excellent Speech of Mr Pyms. The
Law is that which puts a difference betwixt good and evil, betwixt just and
unjust, if you take away the Law, all things will fall into a confusion, every
man will become a Law unto himself, which in the depraved condition of humane
nature, must needs produce many great enormities, Lust will become a Law, and
envy will become a Law, Coveteousnesse and Ambition will become Laws, and what
Dictates, what Decisions such Laws will produce may easily be discerned. It
may indeed by the sad instances over the whole Kingdom; But will Posterity
believe, that in the same Parliament this Doctrine was avowed with that
Acclamation, and these instances after produced; That in the same Parliament
such care was taken that no man should be committed in what case soever,
without the cause of his Imprisonment expressed, and that al(...) men should be
immediately bayled in all Cases bay leable, and during th(...) same Parliament
that Alderman Pennington, or indeed any body else, but the sworn Ministers of
Justice, should imprison whom they would, and for what they would, and for as
long time as they would; That th(...) King should be reproached with breach of
Privilege for accusing Si(...) John Hotham of high treason, when with force of
Arms he kept him ou(...) of Hull, and despised him to his face, because in no
case a Member o(...) either House might be committed or accused without leave
of tha(...) House, of which he is a Member, and yet that during the same
Parliament, the same Alderman should commit the Earl of Middlesex (a Peer of
the Realm) and the Lord Buckhurst (a Member of the House of Commons) to the
Counter without reprehension, that to be a Traitor (which is defined and every
man understands) should be no crime, and to be called Malignant (which no body
knows the meaning of) should be ground enough for close imprisonment; That a
Law should be made, that whosoever should presume to take tunnage and poundage
without an Act of Parliament, should incur the penalty of a Praemunire, and
the same Parliament, that the same imposition should be laid upon our Subjects,
and taken by an order of both Houses, without and against our Consent. Lastly,
that the same Parliament, a Law should be made to declare the proceedings and
judgment upon Ship money to be illegal and void, and during that Parliament,
that an order of both Houses shall, upon pretense of necessity, enable four
men to take away the twentieth part of their Estates from all their Neighbors,
according to their discretion.

But our good Subjects will no longer look upon these and the like results, as
upon the Counsels and conclusions of both our Houses of Parliament; (though
all the world knows even that Authority can never justify things unwarrantable
by the Law) they well know how few of the Persons trusted by them are present
at their consultations, of above 500. not 80. and of the House of Peers, not a
fifth part, that they who are present enjoy not the Privilege and Freedom of
Parliament, but are besieged by an Army, and awed by the same tumults, which
drove us and their fellow Members from thence, to consent to what some few
seditions, Schismatic Persons amongst them do propose; These are the men,
who joining with the Anabaptists and Brownists of London, first changed the
Government and Discipline of that City, and now by the pride and power of that
City would undo the Kingdom, whilst their Lord Major (a Person accused and
known to be guilty of high Treason) by a new Legislative power of his own,
suppresses and reviles the Book of Common Prayer, robbes and imprisons whom he
thinks fit, and with the rabble of his Faction gives Laws to both Houses of
Parliament, and tells them they will have no Accommodation, whilst the Members
sent and entrusted by their Countries, are expelled the House, or committed for
refusing to take the Oath of Association, to live and dye with the Earl of
Essex, as very lately Sir Sidny Mountague. These are the men who have presumed
to send Ambassadors, and to enter into treatyes with foreign States in their
own behalfes, having at this time an Agent of their own with the States of
Holland, to negotiate for them upon private instructions. These are the men,
who not thinking they have yet brought mischief enough upon this Kingdom, at
this time invite and solicit our Subjects of Scotland to enter this Land with
an Army against us. In a word, these are the men who have made this last
devouring ordinance to take away all Law, Liberty, and property from our
people, and have by it really acted that upon our people, which with infinite
malice, and no color or ground, was labored to be infused into them to have
been our Intention by the Commission of Array.

We have done; what power and Authority these men have, or will have, we know
not, for our self we challenge none such; We look upon the pressures and
inconveniences our good Subjects bear, even by us and our Army, (which the
Army first raised by them enforced us to leavy in our defense, and their
refusal of all offers and desires of Treaty enforces us to keep) with very
much sadness of heart; We are so far from requiring a twentieth part of
their Estates (though for their own visible preservation) that as we have
already sold or pawned our own Jewels, and coined our own Plate, so we are
willing to sell all our own Land, and Houses for their relief; yet we do not
doubt but our good Subjects will seriously consider our Condition and their own
Duties, and think our readiness to protect them with the utmost hazard of our
life, deserves their readiness to assist us with some part of their fortunes,
and whilst other men give a twentieth part of their Estates, to enable them to
forfeite the other nineteen, that they will extend themselves to us in a
liberal and free proportion for the preservation of the rest, and for the
maintenance of Gods true Religion, the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the
Subject, and the safety and very being of Parliaments, and this Kingdom: for
if all these ever were, or can be in manifest danger, it is now in this present
Rebellion against us.

Lastly; We will and require all our loving Subjects of what degree or quality
soever, as they will answer it to God, to us, and to posterity, by their oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy, as they would not be looked upon now, and
remembered hereafter, as Betrayers of the Laws and Liberty they were borne to,
that they in no degree submitt to this wild pretended ordinance, and that they
presume not to give any encouragement or assistance to the Army now in
Rebellion against us, which if notwithstanding they shall do, they must expect
from us the severest punishment the Law can inflict, and a perpetual Infamy
with all good men.

FINIS.
