The Tragedy of Phillis, Complaining of the Disloyal Love of Amyntas.
To a New Court Tune.
Amyntas on a Summers day
to shun Apollo's beams,
Was driving of his flock away,
to cast some cooling streams.
And through a Forest as they went
hard by a rivers side,
A voice which from a grove was sent
invited him to bide.
The voice well seemed for to bewray
some Male-contented mind,
For often times did he hear it say
ten thousand times unkind:
The remnant of that raging moan
did all escape his ear,
For every word brought forth a groan
and every groan a tear.
And nearer when it did repair,
both face and voice he knew,
He saw that Phillis was come there
her plaints for to renew,
Thus leaving her unto her plaints
and sorrow slaking groans,
He heard her deadly discontents
thus all breakt forth at once.
Amyntas is thy love to me
of such a light account,
That thou disdainst to look on me
or love as thou was wont.
Were those the Oaths that thou did make
the Vows thou did conceive,
When I for thy contentment sake
my hearts delight did leave.
How often did thou protest to me
the Heaven should turn to naught,
The Sun should first obscured be,
ere thou would change thy thought.
Then heaven desolve without delay
Sun show thy face no more,
Amyntas love is lost for aye,
and woe is me therefore.
Well might I if I had been wise
foreseen what now I find,
But too much love did dull mine eyes
and made my judgment blind:
But O alas! the effect does prove,
that it was plain deceit,
For true and undefiled love
will never turn to hate.
All thy behaviors were (God knows)
too smooth and too discreet,
Like Sugar which impoysoned grows,
suspects because it is sweet.
Thine oaths and vows did promise more
then well thou could perform
Much like a calm that comes before
an unexpected storm.
God knows it would not grieve me much
for to be killed for thee,
But oh, too near it does me touch
that thou should murder me;
God knows I care not for the pain
can come for loss of breath,
It Is thy unkindness cruel Swain
that grives me to the death.
Amyntas tell me if thou may,
if any fault of mine
Has given thee cause for to betray
mine hearts delight and thine:
No, no alas it could not be,
my love to thee was such,
Unless that I if urged thee
in loving thee to much.
But ah, alas what do I gain,
by this my fond complaint,
My dolor doubles my disdain
my grief thy joy augment.
Although it yields no greater good,
it often does ease my mind,
For to reproach the ingratitude
of him that is unkind.
With that her hand, cold, wan and pale,
upon her breast she lays
And seeing that her breath did fail,
she sighs and then she says,
Amyntas, and with that poor Maid
she sighed again full sore,
But after that she never said,
nor sighed, nor breathed no more.
Finis.
