The fetching home of May: OR, A pretty new Ditty wherein is made known,
How each Less does strive for to have a green Gown.

To the Tune of, Room for Company, etc.




NOw Pan leaves piping,
The Gods have done feasting,
there is never a goddess a hunting to day:
Mortals do marvel at Coridons jesting,
that lends them assisting to entertain May.
The Lads and the Lasses,
With scarfes on their faces,
So lively it passes,
trips over the downs:
Much mirth and sport they make
Running at Barley-breake,
Good lack what pains they take
for their green Gowns.
Fine John and Gillian,
Henry with Franses,
Meg with Mary, and Robin with Will:
George and Margery set all the dances,
for they were reported to have the best skill.
Sisle and Nanne
The fairest of many,
That came last of any
from out of the Town,
Quickly got in among
The midst of the throng,
Thus they so much did long
for the green Gown.
Blanch and Betaris
Both of a Family,
came very lasely lagging behind:
Anes and Anibell noted their policy,
Cupid is cunning allthough he be blind:
Winny the witty
That came from the City,
With Parnell the pretty,
and Besse the brown:
Clim Ione and Isabell,
Su Alse and bonny Nell,
Liked of their journeys well,
for the green Gown.
But wanton Deborah
Whispered to Dorrity,
that she should wink upon Richard and Sim,
Now minsing Maudlin showed her authority,
and in the quarrel did venture a limme:
Sibill was sickly
And could not come quickly,
And therefore was lickely
to fall in a swound.
There was none would tarry
For Hugh nor for Harry,
Lest Christian should carry
away the green Gown.
Thus all the Youngsters
Had reached the green Meddowes,
where they appointed to gather their May,
Some in the Sunshine, and some in the shadows,
singled in couples did fall to their play.
Constant Penelope
Faith, Hope and Charity,
Looked very modestly,
yet they safe down:
Prudens prevented
What Rachell repented,
And Cate was contented
to take the green Gown.
The second part,
To the same tune.


THis Maying so pleased,
Most of the fine Lasses,
that they much desired to fetch in May flowers,
For to strew the windows and such like places,
besides they will have May bows fit for shady Rowers.
But most of all they go
To find where love does grow,
Each young man knows it is so,
else he is Clown:
For it is an old saying
There is great joying,
When Maids go a Maying,
they will have a green Gown.
Maidens and young men go
As it is an order old
for to drink merrily, and eat spiced Cakes,
The Lads and the Lasses their customs will hold
for they will go walk in the fields like loving Mates:
Em calls for Mary,
And Ruth calls for Sarah,
Iddy calls for Hary
to man them along:
Martin calls Marcy,
Dick calls for Debary,
Then they go lovingly
all in a throng.
The bright Apollo
Was all the while peeping,
to see if his Daphne had bin in the throng,
And missing her hastily downward was creeping,
for that is imagined they tarri'd too long
Then all the troop mourned
And homeward returned,
For Cynthia scorned
to smils or to frown:
Thus did they gather May
All the long Summers day,
And went at night away,
each with a green Gown.
Bright Venus still glisters,
Out shining of Luna,
Saturn was present, as right did require,
And he called Jupiter with his Queen Juno,
to see how Dame Venus did burn in desire:
Now Jove sent Mercury
To Vulcan hastily,
Because he should descry
Dame Venus down:
Vulkan came running,
On Mars he stood frowning,
Yet for all his cunning,
Venus had a green Gown.
Cupid shootes Arrows
At Venus her Darlings,
for they are nearest unto him by kind:
Diana he hits not nor ca^ he pierce worldlings
for they have strong armor his darts to defend:
The one has chastity,
And Cupid does defy,
The others cruelty,
makes him a clown:
But leaving this I see,
From Cupid few are free,
And there is much courtesy
in a green Gown.
FINIS.
