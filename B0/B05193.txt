unequal where Presbytries are so; but in a due proportion to the Churches and
Parochines within every Presbytry, as they shall judge convenient; and it is
hereby Declared, That all Schoolmasters, and Teachers of Youth in Schools,
are, and shall be liable to the Trial, Judgment and Censure of the Presbytries
