THE Courtiers Health; OR The merry BOYS of the TIMES
He that loves Sack, does nothing lack,
If he but Loyal be,
He that denies Bacchus supplies
Shows mere Hypocrisy.
To a new Tune, Come Boys fill us a Bumper, Or My Lodging is on the Cold
ground.
Here she stands and fills it out amain,
Says they let us have the 'tother Bout agan.


COme boys fill us a Bumper,
we will make the Nation Roar,
She Is grown sick of a Rumper
that sticks on the old score.
Pox on Phanatticks rout 'um,
they thirst for our blood,
We Will Taxes raise without 'um,
and drink for the Nations good.
Fill the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a brimmer to the KING.
Round around, fill a fresh one,
let no man bawk his Wine,
We Will drink to the next in Succession,
and keep it in the Right Line,
Bring us ten thousand glasses,
the more we drink we are a dry,
We mind not the beautiful Lasses,
whose Conquest lies all in the eye.
Charge the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a brimmer to the KING
WE Boys are truly Loyal,
for Charles we will venture all,
We know his blood is Royal,
his Name shall never fall.
But those that seek his ruin
may chance to dye before him,
While we that Sack are woeing,
for ever will adore him;
Fill the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a Brimmer to the KING,
I hate those strange dissenters
that strives to bawk a glass,
He that at all Adventures
will see what comes to pass:
And let the Popish Faction
disturb us if they can,
They never shall breed distraction
in a true hearted man.
Fill the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a Brimmer to the KING.
Let the Phanatticks grumble
to see things cross their grain,
We Will make them now more humble
or ease them of their pain:
They shall drink Sack amain too
as else they shall be choked,
We Will tell 'um it is in vain too
for us to be provoked.
Fill the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a Brimmer to the KING.
He that denies the Brimmer
shall banished be in this Isle,
And we will look more grimmer
till he begins to smile:
We Will drowned him in Canary
and make him all our own,
And when his Heart is merry
he will drink to Charles in's Throne;
Fill the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a Brimmer to the KING.
Quakers and Annabaptist
we will sink them in a glass,
He deals most plain and flattest
that says he loves a Lass:
Then tumble down Canary
and let your brains go round,
For he that will not be merry
he cannot at heart be sound;
Fill the Pottles and Gallons
and bring the Hogshead in,
We Will begin with a Tallen
a Brimmer to the KING.
