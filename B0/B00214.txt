The little Barly-Corne.
Whose Properties and Virtues here,
Shall plainly to the world appear:
To make you merry all the year.
To the tune of Stingo.


COme, and do not musing stand,
if thou the truth discern,
But take a full cup in thy hand,
and thus begin to learn,
Not of the earth, nor of the air,
at evening or at morn,
But iouiall boys your Christmas keep
with the little Barly-Corne.
It is the cunningst Alchymist,
that ere was in the Land,
Twill change your mettle when it list,
in turning of a hand,
Your blushing Gold to Silver wan,
your Silver into Brass,
Twill turn a Tailor to a man,
and a man into an asle.
Twill make a poor man rich to hang
a sign before his door,
And those that do the Pitcher bang,
though rich twill make them poor;
Twill make the silliest poorest Snake,
the Kings great Porter scorn,
Twill make the stoutest Lubber weak,
this little Barly-Corne.
It has more shifts then Lamb ere had,
or Hocus Pocus too,
It will good fellows show more sport,
then Banks his horse could do:
Twill play you fair above the board,
unless you take good heed,
And fell you though you were a Lord,
and justify the deed.
It lends more years unto old age,
than ere was lent by nature,
It makes the Poets fancy rage,
more than Castalian water:
Twill make a Huntsman chase a For,
and never wind his horn,
Twill cheer a Tinker in the stocks,
this little Barly-Corne.
It is the only Will oth'wispe,
which leads men from the way,
It Will make the tongue-ti'd Lawyer lisp
and naught but (hie up) say,
Twill make the Steward droope and stoop,
his Bills he then will scorn,
And at each post cast his reckning up,
this little Barly-Corne.
Twill make a man grow jealous soon,
whose pretty Wife goes trim,
And rail at the deceiving Moon,
for making horns at him:
Twill make the Maidens trimly dance,
and take it in no scorn,
And help them to a friend by chance;
this little Barly-Corne.
It is the neatest Seruingman,
to entertain a friend,
It will do more than money can,
all iarring suits to end:
There Is life in it, and it is here,
it is here within this cup,
Then take your liquor do not spare,
but clear carouse it up.
The second part of the little Barly-Corne, That cheareth the heart both
evening and morn.
To the same Tune.


IF sickness come, this Physic take,
it from your heart will set it,
If fear incroach, take more of it,
your heart will soon forget it,
Apollo and the Muses nine,
do take it in no scorn,
There Is no such stuff to pass the time
as the little Barly-Corne.
Twill make a weeping Widow laugh,
and soon incline to pleasure:
Twill make an old man leave his staff
and dance a youthful measure;
And though your clothes be nere so bad,
all ragged, rent, and torn,
Against the cold you may be clad,
with the little Barly-Corne.
Twill make a Coward not to shrink,
but be as stout as may be;
Twill make a man that he shall think,
that Ione's as good as my Lady:
It will enrich the palest face,
and with Rubies it adorn,
Yet you shall think it no disgrace,
this little Barly-Corne.
Twill make your Gossips merry,
when they their liquour see,
Hey we shall nere be weary,
sweet Gossip here is to thee;
Twill make the Country Yeoman,
the Courtier for to scorn,
And talk of Lawsuits ore a Can,
with this little Barly-Corne.
It makes a man that write cannot,
to make you large Indentures,
When as he reeleth home at night,
upon the Watch he ventures,
He cares not for the Candlelight,
that shines in the horn,
Yet he will stumble the way aright,
this little Barly-Corne.
Twill make a Mizer prodigal,
and show himself kind hearted,
Twill make him never grieve at all,
that from his Coin has parted,
Twill make the Shepherd to mistake
his Sheep before a storm:
Twill make the Poet to excel,
this little Barly-Corne.
It will make young Lads to call
most freely for their liquor,
Twill make a young Less take a fall,
and rise again the quicker:
Twill make a man that he
shall sleep all night profoundly,
And make a man what ere he be,
go about his business roundly.
Thus the Barly-Corne has power,
even for to change our nature,
And make a Shrew within an hour,
prove a kind-hearted creature:
And therefore here I say again,
let no man take it in scorn,
That I the virtues do proclaim,
of the little Barly-Corne.
