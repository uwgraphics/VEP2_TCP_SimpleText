Two pleasant Ditties, one of the Birth, the other of the Passion of Christ.
To the tune of Dulcina. Of Nativity.


IVry came to Ieru-salem,
(all the world was taxed then)
Blessed Mary brought to Bethelem,
more then all the world again:
A gift so blessed,
So good, the best
that ere was seen, was heard or done,
A King, a Christ,
Prophet, and Priest:
a Jesus, God, a Man, a Son.
Happy night, a day was never,
half so happy sweet and fair:
Singing Soldiers (blessed ever)
fill the sky with sweetest air.
Amazed men fear,
They see, they hear.
yet doubt and ask how this was done:
It Was bid, be bold,
It was fore told,
this night has God himself a Son,
There appears a golden Usher,
Kings attending in their train:
The bright Sun could not out blush her,
such a Star never shone again.
See now it stays,
Seeming it says,
Go in and see, what there is done,
A Child whose birth,
Leagues heaven and earth,
Jesus to us, to God a Son.
Subtle Herod sought to find him,
with a purpose black as hell:
But a greater power confin^d him,
and his purpose did repel:
Who should betray,
Do al obey,
as fitting was it should be done:
They al adore,
And kneel before,
this God and Man, to God a Son.
'Twas upon a Commets blazing,
Cuma to Augustus said,
This fore-shewes an act amazing:
for a Mother still a maid,
A Babe shall bear,
That al must fear,
and suddenly it must be done:
Nay Caesar thou,
To him must bow,
he is God, a Man, to God a Son.
Is not this a blessed wonder,
God is Man, and Man is God:
Foolish Jews mistook the thunder,
should proclaim this King abroad.
Angels they sing,
Behold the King,
in Bethelem where this was done:
Then we as they,
Rejoice and say,
We have a Savior, God a Son.
The second part.
To the same Tune.


TVrne your eyes that are affixed
on this worlds deceuing things:
And with joys and sorrows mixed,
look upon the King of Kings,
Who let his thrown:
With joys unknown:
took flesh like ours, like us drew breath
For us to die,
Here fix our eye,
and think upon his precious death.
See him in the garden praying,
while his sad Disciples slept:
See him in the Garden sweating
drops of blood and how he wept:
As man he was,
He wept (alas)
and trembling fear to loose his breath,
Yet to heavens will,
He yielded still:
then think upon his precious death.
See him by the Soldiers taken,
when with Aue and a kiss:
He that Heaven had quite forsaken,
had betrayed him and with this,
Behold him (bound
And guarded round)
to Caiphas borne to loose his breath,
There see the Jews
Heavens King abuse:
O think upon his precious death.
See him in the hands of Pilat,
like a base offender stripped:
See the moan, and tears they smile at,
while they see our Savior whipped.
Behold him bleed,
His purple weed
record, while you have life and breath,
His taunts and scorns,
His Crown of thorns,
or think upon his precious death.
See him in the hour of parting,
hanging on his bloody Cross:
See his wounds, conceive his smarting,
and our gain, by his lives loss.
On either side
A Fellow died,
the one derides him leaving breath:
The other prays,
And humbly says:
O save me by thy precious death.
See as in these pangs he thirsted,
and that heat to cool did call,
How these Jews (like Judas cursed)
bring him vinegar and gall,
His spirit then,
To Heaven again,
commending with his latest breath,
The world he leaves,
That man deceaues:
O think upon his precious death.
Finis.
