The Seamen and Soudiers Last Farwell to their Dearest Jewels.
He must be gone, the Fates have so decreed,
To serve his King and Country in their need:
In fight against the Dutch upon the Main,
Yet he is in hopes to see his Love again:
He chears her up, and bids she should not Mourn,
But wait with patience for his safe return.
The tune is, I am so deep in Love, or, Cupids Courtesy




Farewell my dearest dear,
now I must leave thee,
Thy sight I must forbear
although it grives me:
From thy embraces love
shall be parted:
Yet will I constant prove
and be true-hearted.
My fortune I will try
upon the Ocean,
And fight most valiantly
to gain promotion;
My dearest blood i will spend
for this our Nation,
My Country to defend
from Foes invasion.
Princes of high renown
are now engaged,
To pull the courage down
of Foes enraged:
Dukes, Lords and gentry high,
all are preparing
Their valor for to try,
no cost is sparing.
Why should I grudge to fight
under the Banners,
Of such approved Knights
and brave Commanders:
My chanceI mean to try,
I scorn to hide me,
I Will face the Enemy
what e're betide me,




WHen I am on the Seas
in hail and thunder,
Where storms do raise the waves
to all men's wonder,
When Billows brush the sky
and tempests threat me,
Still on thy name I Will cry
I Will nor forget thee
Though Hogan Mogan States
do drag and bluster,
And call upon their Mates
forces to muster,
We 'I make them for to know
we can disturb them,
Once again they must bow
England will curb them.
In midst of skirmish hot
when blows are dealing,
Fiery balls fly about
and ships are realing:
When Cannons are roaring
and bullets are flying,
He that will honor win
Must not fear dying.
My dearest do not moan
let not grief move thee,
When I am from thee gone
still I will love thee,
If fortune me befriend,
thou may he certain
He often to thee send
after our parting.
Thy Love I Will think upon
in greatest danger,
When I am from thee gone
I Will Love no stranger,
No flesh alive shall make
me prove unconstant;
I will wait for thy sake,
till the last instant,
This piece of Gold we will break,
love, nor a token,
Which as a pledge we will keep
of faith unbroken,
When thou the same do see
in my long absence,
Then love remember me
though at a distance.
Hark how the Drums do beat
with Trumpets sounding
Soldiers in furious heat
foes would be wounding
From thy sweet company
although it grieves me
I must divided be
and fore't to leave thee,
My Captain calls away
in have they hurry
To march without delay
I may not tarry,
Patiently thou must hear
love, leave thy weeping,
Farewell my dearest dear,
till our next meeting.
