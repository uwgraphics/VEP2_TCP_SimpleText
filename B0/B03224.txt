AN ELEGY On the Death of Thomas Beddingfield Esquire Who was Murdered by Mr.
Thomas Barney, AT NORWICH, On Sunday the 20th. day of July, 1684.
4. Aug. 1684
THe Hearts of Men can never be at Ease,
Till they with floods of Grief their Souls appease:
For he who does not this loved Man Bemoan,
His Heart's composed of Adamantine-Stone:
Yet all the Tears are offerr'd by your Eyes,
And all the Griefs relenting Hearts comprize,
Are due to him, as his just Obsequies.
The Countries Darling, and Mankinds Delight,
Is snacth'd as on a sudden from our Sight.
But Reader think he was prepared to Dye,
Whose Life was Virtue and Morality.
Envy it self, could never eclips his Fame,
His Life was Innocent and void of Blame:
His business on the Earth was doing Good,
And 'twas as customary as his Food.
He was all Mildness and good Nature, he
Was Exercised in works of Charity:
The Scale of all his Actions were so even,
He was too good for Earth, and's gone to Heaven.
But for the Instrument of his sad End,
The Blackest Angel does his Fate Attend;
And so Impatient of Revenge is grown,
He seems to lash the Lazy Minutes on:
The Sword of Vengeance ready in his Hand,
To Execute the Almighty's just Command.
His Blood so Innocent, aloud does cry
For Vengeance, and its heard beyond the Sky.
And a severe Repentance only can
Make God acquit the Guilty for this Man.
But for his present State, it needs must be
Attended both with Shame and Misery:
The greatest Advocate that now should Plead
In the behalf of such a Cursed Deed,
Acts over again a Murder on the Dead;
And makes his horrid Wounds a fresh to Bleed.
Were his Friends never so Potent they must fail
In the Address, and Justice must Prevail:
Nor can his Blood 'ere wash away his Guilt,
Or make amends for that which he has Spilt.

Castle, in Thames Street, 1684.
