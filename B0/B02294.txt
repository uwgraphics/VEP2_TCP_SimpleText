Come to it at last Or the succesful Adventurer.
A pleasant and delightful New Song.
In vain resistances when love designs
He by compulsion or compliance joins,
Laughs at what e're opposes his decree
And what says must, that must surely be.
A pleasant new Tune, Or, toll me Jenny.






TEll me Jenny, tell me roundly,
when you will your Heart surrender:
Faith and troth ise love you soundly;
it is I that was the first Pretender.
Never say nay, nor delay,
here is my heart, and there is my hand too;
All that is mine shall be thine,
Body and Goods at your Command too.
Ah! how many Maids (quoth Jenny)
have you promised to be true to?
Fie, I think the Devil's in you,
to kiss a body so as you do.
What do you do? let me go,
I cannot abide such foolish doing;
Get you gone, naughty man,
(...)
Prithee Jenny don't deny me;
whence this coyness? why these blushes?
Sure you use them but to try me,
and they suite not with your wishes:
Do not frown, but sit down
on this Primrose-Bed, my Sweeting,
And, my Love, this shall prove
to thee and me a happy meeting.
How many Maids (that have believed
this, quoth Jenny, as your meaning)
Have you heretofore deceived?
yet you think it is no sinning.
Fie; I say, stand away,
naughty Man, I hate such fooling:
Fie; O sad! I think you are mad
(...)


It Is unkind you thus deny me
when I tell you that I love ye;
Sit you down, and do but try me,
and you better will approve (...)e:
Come my Jenny, best of any
in your True-Loves Arm^ i will place you;
Sigh not thus, but let us buss,
Love and Hymen both shall grace you.
This (quoth Jenny) is but your saying,
you men are false it is often proved, so
Poor Maids you long to be betraying;
O fie, I will not be loved so.
What do you do? let me go,
Fie, naughty man, Fie, let me loose:
Oh! bless me, how you press me,
I think you are wild to hug one thus.
In your eyes I see a yiedling,
I prithee do not thus dissemble,
Nor your heart with doubt be sheilding,
but the queen of Love resemble:
See my Arms wait your charms,
and I must have no denial;
Say not nay, nor delay,
but of my passion make a trial*
What is it you would be doing?
pish, I can no longer tarry;
Nay, forbear, is this your wooing?
avads I wo' not till I marry;
Nay, I will not, pray now don't,
Oh me! fie, nay it is evil;
Oh! what is this? I profess
you grow more and more uncivil.
The god of Love gives commission,
and these pleasant shades invite us;
Nay, you must grant my kind Petition,
since to love all things incite us:
My Dear Heart, do not start,
joys attend you, transports seize you;
Still to you i will be true
in your Arms; thus ever please you.
Oh! you hurt me, nay, forbear now,
what do you do, you have betrayed me;
Oh! I Am ruined, and I fear now
you are about for to un-Maid me;
Take your course, use your force,
kill me, kill me, if you please;
Nay i will dye willingly,
in this sweet Wrath I find such ea^^
