To her brown Beard.
For i will warrant the Girl he will Love the.
This Counsel does advise all Maidens, kind,
To have a ca^e lest Cupid make them blind,
Whereby to dote on Young men's fickle Love,
Which their actions will unconstant prove:
Husbands enough, and plenty may be had,
Some very good, and some exceeding bad;
Then come fair Maids, pray pick and choose the best,
And let Old Nick make use of all the rest,
Tune of Sweet is the Lass, or my maidenhead will not over load me.


YOu pretty Ladies all
That merrily are disposed
Once again to you I call
To hear what is disclosed?
It Is but a jest, yet it is the best,
And such conceits does move me,
To tell you true, as you may know
Which is the man does love thee.
In the first place I shall you tell
How you may easily find him;
Do but observe his carriage well;
Yet make tho you did not mind him:
Observe also how he does go,
As thy fancy it does move thee,
I she he fair and honest too
I Will warrant thee girl he will love thee.
If he be of nature meek and mild,
Or of a carriage civil,
But if he has a Girl with Child
Oh that is an action evil,
Such a beard do not come near,
Though he vows to lie above thee,
But it he is one that is fair and young
I Will warrant thee girl he will love thee.
But of a wanton have a care,
That will both drink and swagger,
He Will bring his Toushold poor and hare
Himself will turn a Beggar:
But it thous't find one of thy mind
You shall no whit disprove me,
Make choice of one that near did wrong
I Will warrant etc.
Be not afraid of a Carrot heard
They Are good when they be sodden,
So is a Ten that has new said
If she be not too much trodden,
Brown Tair I find is true and kind,
I speak as't does bohove me,
But black I wis, has a good kiss,
I Will warrant etc.
A red Hair'd man will find a Purse
To sit long on Alebenches,
But yettow Hair is ten times worse,
He loves to follow menthes:
And for gray Hair, is full of care,
Young flesh it will move thee,
But he that is turl'd above the world
I Will warrant etc.
Of sandy-Hair have a great care.
For fear lest he be jealous,
And of a red Nose to beware,
For he does love the Alehouse:
Let not a red come in thy bed,
White Hair is it will move thee.
But perfect brown's the hest in Town,
I Will warrant etc.
The Flaten Hair it is very good,
And of such a civil carriage,
Leather beards of a sturvy mood:
Ioyn not with him in marriage:
A down looked man that is pale and wan.
Of all delights he will prove the,
Red theary theek is mild and week,
I Will warrant etc.
From others let toy praise proceed
When as they do come near thee,
There Is some do make great shows indeed
But will not love you dearly.
Of such beware and have a care.
I speak as't does behove me.
Choose but him that is like to me,
I Will warrant etc.
Some maidens they do sore lament
Because they are forsaken.
Therefore these lines I did invent
That none should ve mistaken
So maids adieu I did to you,
Trial it is approved in me,
Think what you will, the brown Hair still
I Will warrant thee girl, he will love thee.
