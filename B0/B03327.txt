The flattering young Man and the modest Maid.
To be Sung to the pleasant Tune of, The Duke of Florence March.
The young Man's Affection. Often have I vowed to love no one,
but when I think on thee,
I have no power for to give over,
thy Captive I must be;
So many looks and graces dwells
between these Lips and Eyes,
That whosoever sees thy Face,
must once be made a prize.
2.
Often have I viewed thy comely parts
from head unto the toe,
Which makes me fry in Cupids flames,
the truth of all is so;
For when I ly upon my Bed,
in hopes to take my rest,
I cannot sleep to think on thee,
whom I in heart love best.
3.
Often have I Kissed thy Rudie Lips,
which are more rare and sweet,
Than Sugar and the Cinnamon,
when they together meet.
The sweet perfumed breath of thine,
does such great pleasure bring,
That when I Kiss, it makes me think
upon another thing.
4.
Often have I in my folded Arms
thy lovely Corpse embraced,
Whereby with thy sweet Company
my Person has been graced;
But never could I so happy be
to have my full delight,
To daily Court and play with thee,
and ly with thee all night:
5.
Often have I much desired to hear,
thy sweet melodious voice,
Whose sugered Notes may seem to make
a love sick Man rejoice;
The pretty toys, the Female joys,
and rare conceits of thine
Must either make a pleasant cure,
or kill this heart of mine,
6.
Often have I took thee by the hand,
a bargain for to make,
And thou did also promise me
thou would not me forsake.
Come now dear love, perform they vows,
and ease me of my pain;
Or else with Cupids piercing Dart
my Heart will soon be slain

I tell you flat and plain:

Its not the tempting looks of thine,

6,
When as the young Man understood
to what the Maid was bent,
Most kindly he saluted her,
and so away they went,
He liked her, she liked him.
matters were so well carried,
That on the morrow morning next
they Kissed and after married.

FINIS.
