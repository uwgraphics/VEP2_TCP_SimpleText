CALEDONS GRATULATORY RAPTURE At the Happy Return of our Dread Lord and
SOVEREIGN KING CHARLES THE SECOND.
HEnce Hellish fury's to your Stygian Cells,
Here is nor Time, nor Place, for Charms, or Spells,
Our Horizontall Phoebus does appear
To guild the Zodiac of this Hemisphear
With Royal Rays: Although your furious rage
Long forced their Clyms, to prove the dismal stage
Of Treasons, Murders, Ruins, Rapins, When
Power was usurped by the scum of men:
The Throne was Razed, And Sacred Majesty
Was sacrifized to the Tyranny
Of worst of Vermin, All the Royal Race
Exiled, and Royalty in high disgrace
Entered; How (then) obscured was our Light?
Our Day transformed to Cymerian night?
Yet from this Phoenix's ashes, lo, their springs
A Phoenix that is the Diadem of Kings:
With what transcending glory does he rise,
To clear the shads of our long dark'ned skies;
The Thron's repaired, Majesty restored,
The Regal Race returned, admired, adored!
Brave Hero's, great restorers of the Crown!
All future ages shall your true renown
Admire; And the unparalelled Story
Proclaim, of your so much deserving Glory.
But generous George, the George most high deserves
Of Royal bounty, which as yet reserves
A Magazine of Honor, to Proclaim
The meritorious grandour of his Fame:
While Regicids with infamy arraigned,
And all their Complice's with shame are stained.
Then Loyal Natives, let us chaunt and sing
With cheerful Acclamations Carolling
This Day, This Solemn-memorable Day
How beautified, by the Royal Ray
Of Sacred Majesty? How hearts, and tongues
Enlarged are, in cheerful cries and songs?
The Heaven's resoun'd, The Eccho's do reply,
The sweet concordance of this Harmony;
Long live Renowned, Renowned long be the Reign
Of Charl's the Second, our Dread Sovereign.
FINIS.
