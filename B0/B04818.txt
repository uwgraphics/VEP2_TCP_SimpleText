Loves fierce desire, and hopes of Recovery.
Or, A true and brief Description of two Resolved Lovers; whose Excellent wits,
suitable minds, and faithful hearts one to another, shall heedfully be spoken of
in this following new made paper of Verses.
To a delightful new tune, Or, Fair Angel ofEngland.


NOw the Tyrant has stolen
my dearest away;
And I am confined
with Mopsa to stay:
Yet let Celia remember
how faithful i will be,
Neither distance nor absence
shall terrify me.
In Volumns of sighs,
I will send to my Dear,
And make my own heart
correspond to my fear:
Till the Soul of my life
may be pleased to see,
How delightful her safest
return is to me.
It cheers my sad heart
to remember her love,
Though malice has caused
this sudden remove:
And my mind is resolved
what ever ensue,
Whether Sunshine or thunder,
to be constant and true.
If my Bark sail but safely
through this rugged Sea,
Though with contrary Wind,
much tossed it be:
In the Haven of rest,
and long looked for content,
I Will chaunt forth melodious
Songs of merriment.
Till then i will retreat to
the Forest and mourn;
Acteon shall echo
my Hound and my Horn.
No Reynard shall escape me
that runs on the way,
But patience perforce
I will make him to stay.
My heart has enquired
of every Stone,
What convoy the Heavens
has bequeathed to my moan:
But for ought I can find,
holy Angels are agreed,
To rival my hopes,
and to slacken her speed.




Therefore i will sit down, and
bewail my sad Fate,
Like the Turtle i will mourn
for the loss of my mate:
All the worlds greatest glories
vexation to me,
Till my Celia and I,
in our loves may be free.

Celia her sweet Reply to her faithful friend. Thy speeches dear friend
I have well understood,
And how in exile
thou have wandered at the wood
But I am resolved
thy sorrows to free,
To make thee amends,
i will soon come unto thee.
It Is neither the Tiger,
the Wolf, nor the Bear,
Nor shall Nylus Crocodile
put me in fear:
I Will swim through the Ocean
upon my bare Breast,
To find out my Darling,
whom I do love best.
And when I have found him,
with double delight,
I Will comfort him kindly
by day and by night:
And i will be more faithful
then the Turtle-Dove,
Which never at all did
prove false to her Love.
The fierce Basilisks that
kills with the eye,
Shall not have the power
once thee to come nigh:
I Will clip thee and hug thee
so close in my arms,
And i will venture my life
for to save thee from harms.
My Lap for thy head love,
a Pillow shall be,
And whilst thou do sleep,
i will be careful of thee:
I Will wake, and i will watch, and
i will kiss thee for joy,
And no Venomous Creature
shall my Love annoy.
The Satyrs shall Pipe,
and the Sirens shall sing,
The wood-nimphs with music
shall make the Groves ring:
The Horn it shall sound,
and the Hounds make a noise,
To recreate my Love
with ten thousand rare joys.
So now I am coming
to hasten the deed,
Pray Heaven and Gods Angels
to be my good speed:
If fortune me favor, and
Seas quiet prove,
I soon will arrive at
the Port which I love.

Now Celia is gone to
find out her Dear,
His Heart that was sad
to comfort and cheer:
No doubt but each other
they will lovingly greet,
When as they together
do lovingly meet.
