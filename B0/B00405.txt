The true Maid of the South: OR A rare example of a Maid dwelling at Rye in
Sussex, who for the love of a young man of Lester-shire, went beyond Sea in the
habit of a Page, and after, to their hearts content, were both married at
Magrum in Germany, and now dwelling at Rye aforesaid.
To the tune of, Come, come my sweet and bonny one.


Within the Haven Town of Rye,
that stands in Sussex fair
There dwelt a Maid, whose constancy
transcendeth all compare:
This Turtle Dove
Did dearly love
A Youth, who did appear
In mind and face,
To be the grace
and pride of Lester-shire.
This young man with a Noble Peer,
who liked his service well,
Went from his native Lester-shire,
in Sussex for to dwell:
Where living nigh
The Town of Rye,
this pretty Maid did hear
Of his good parents,
Who by deserts,
was pride of Lester-shire.
For coming once into that Town,
it was at first his chance,
To meet with her, whose brave renown
all Sussex did advance:
And she likewise,
In his faice eyes
When once sue came him near,
Did plainly see,
That none but he,
was pride of Lester-shire.
Then little Cupid god of Love,
began to play his part,
And on the sudden from above,
he shot his golden Dart,
Which did constrain
These Lovers twain
to prize each other dear:
Sweet Margery
Loved Anthony,
the pride of Lester-shire.
Thus with concordant sympathy,
these Lovers were combined,
Oue loved the other heartily,
yet neither told their mind,
She longed to speak,
Her mind to break
unto her Lover dear,
She durst not tell,
Though she loved well
the pride of Lester-shire.
Within short time it came to pass.
to Sea the young man went,
And left this young and pretty Less
in woe and discontent:
Who wept full sore,
And grieved therefore,,
when truly she did hear,
That her sweetheart.
From her must part,
the pride of Lester-shire.
The second part.
To the same tune.
IT was his hap that time to go
to travel with his Lord,
Which to his heart did breed much woe,
yet could he not afford
A remedy
To's misery,
but needs he must leave here
His Madge behind
Who grieved in mind
for the pride of Lester-shire.
She being then bereaved clean
of hope, yet did invent,
By her rare policy, a mean
to work her hearts content:
In garments strange
She straight did change
her self, rejecting fear,
to go with him
Whom she did deem
the pride of Lester-shire.
And in the habit of a Page,
she did entreat his Lord,
That being a Boy of tender age,
he would this grace afford,
That he might go,
Service to show
to him both far and near,
Who little thought
What love she ought
to the pride of Lester-shire.
This Lord did take her, as she seemed
to be a prettty Lad,
And for his Page he her esteemed,
which made her heart full glad:
To Sea went she,
And so did he,
whom she esteemed so dear
Who for her sake
Great moan did make,
and shed full many a tear.
Thus he poor Lad, lay with his Love
full many a tedious night,
Yet neither of them both did prove
a Lovers true delight:
She heard him weep,
Who^ he should sleep,
and shed forth many a ^ea^^
For Margery,
Who th^^ lay by
the pride of Lester-shire.
Long time these Lovers traveled,
and were bed-fellowes still,
Yet she did keep her Mayden-head,
until she had her will.
She heard his moan,
Yet still unknown
she kept her self for fear,
Yet at the last
She cleaued full fast
to the pride of Lester-shire.
For having traveled six weeks
unknown unto her Lover,
With roisie blushes in her cheeks
her mind she did discover:
See here, quoth she,
One that for thee
has left her Parents dear:
Poor Margery
The Maid of Rye
I am, behold me here.
When Anthony did hear this word,
his heart with joy did leap,
He went unto his Noble Lord,
to whom he did report
This wonderful thing,
Which straight did bring
amazement to him there:
Of such a Page,
In any age,
quoth he, I did not hear.
At Magrum then in Germany,
their Lord did see them married,
From whence unto the Town of Rye
in England were they carried;
Where now they dwell
Beloved well
of neighbors far and near,
Sweet Margery
Loves Anthony
the pride of Lester-shire.
You Mayds and young men warning take
by these two Lovers kind,
Who ever you your choice do make,
to them be true in mind,
For, perfect love,
Comes from above
as may by this appear,
Which came to pass
By Suffex Less,
and the Lad of Lester-shire.
Finis.
