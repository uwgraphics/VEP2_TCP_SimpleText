BY THE KING.
A Proclamation for the Encouragement of Seamen and Mariners to return to
their Obedience to the Kings Majesty, and to continue in His Service.
HIS MAJESTY understanding, that many Seamen and Mariners employed by
Merchants being in Rebellion against Him, or apparently adhering to the Rebels,
have an Inclination to return to their due Obedience, as Duty and Loyalty does
oblige them; But that the necessity of their Condition is such, as that unless
they may be assured of satisfaction for their Wages and Entertainment upon
their coming to Land, or into the Ports in Obedience to His Majesty, they may
be exposed to misery, and so disabled not only to maintain themselves and
their Families, but also to do the King that Service which they desire. His
Majesty therefore taking the same into His Princely Consideration, and the good
Services which these Seamen and Mariners may perform unto Him; And being
willing to give them all fit Encouragement, does hereby Declare, and Promise in
the Word of a King, That what Seamen and Mariners soever, shall bring any Ship
or Ships, or other Vessel whatsoever into any Port or Harbor within. His
Majesty's Obedience, they shall not only have their free Pardons for what is
past; But shall also be rewarded with two Third parts of the whole Value of
every such Ship and Vessel, and the Loading thereof, to be immediately divided
amongst the Captains, Masters, Officers, and Mariners of the said Ships and
Vessels; And that they, or as many of them as shall desire it, shall
immediately be again employed, entertained, and set to Sea for His Majesty's
Service, either in the said Ship or Vessel, that they shall so bring in, or in
some other which shall be fitted for that purpose, and have such Entertainment
and Wages as has at any time been allowed unto them heretofore.

Given at His MAJESTIESCourt at OXFORD, this 22thday of February, in the
Twentieth year of His Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
