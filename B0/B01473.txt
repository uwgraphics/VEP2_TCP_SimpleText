An Admirable New (...) Northern Story
Of two constant Lovers as I understand,
Were born near Appleby in Westmo^e^and,
The Lads name Anthony, Constance the Lass,
To Sea they went both and great dangers did pass:
How they suffered ship wrack on the Coast of Spain
For two years divided, and then met ag^^^,
By wonderful forture and care accident,
And now both live at home with joy and content.
The Tune is I would thou were in Shrewsbury.




TWo Lovers in the North,
Constance and Anthony,
Of them I will set forth
a gallant History;
They loved exceeding well,
as plainly does appear;
But that which I shall tell,
the like you never did hear.
Still she cries Anthony,
my bonny Anthony,
Gang thou by Land or Sea,
I Will wend along with thee,
Anthony must to Sea,
his Calling did him bind,
My Constance, Dear, quoth he,
I must leave thee behind.
I prithee do not grieve,
thy tears will not prevail:
I Will think on thee, my Sweet,
when the Ships under Sail.
But still, etc.
OHw may that be? said he,
consider well the case:
Quoth she, sweet Anthony,
I Will bide not in this place.
If thou gang, so will I,
of the means do not doubt:
A Woman's policy
great matters may find out:
My bonny Anthony, etc.
I would be very glad,
but prithee tell me how?
I Will dress me like a Lad,
what say thou to me now?
The Sea thou can no^brook,
yes very well, quoth she,
I Will Scullion to the Cook
for thy sweet company.
My bonny, etc.
Anthony's leave she had,
and dressed in Man's array,
She seemed the blithest Lad
seen on a Summers Day.
O see what Love can do,
at home she will not bide:
With her true Love she will go,
let well or woe betide.
My dearest, etc.
In the Ship 'twas her Lot
to be the under-Cook;
And at the Fire hot,
wonderful pains she took:
She served every one,
fitting to their degree;
And now and then alone,
she kissed Anthony.
My bonny Anthony,
my bonny Anthony,
Gang thou by Land or Sea,
I Will wend along with thee.


ALack and weladay,
by Tempest on the Main,
Their S^ip was cast away
upon the Coast of Spain;
To the mercy of the Waves,
they all committed were,
Constance her own self saves,
then she cries for her dear,
My bonny Anthony,
my bonny Anthony,
Gang thou by Land or Sea,
I Will wend along with thee.
Swimming upon a Plank,
at Bilbo she got ashore
First she did heaven thank,
then she lamented sore,
O woe is me, said she,
the saddest Lass alive,
My dearest Anthony,
now on the Sea does drive.
My bonny, etc.
What shall become of me,
why do I strive for shore,
Since my sweet Anthony,
I never shall see more?
Fair Constance do not grieve,
the same good providence,
Has sav'^ thy lover sweet,
but he is far from hence,
Still, etc.
A Spanish Merchant rich.
saw this fa^r seeming Lad,
That did lament so much,
and was so grevious sad,
He had in England been
and English understood,
He having heard and seen,
he in amazement stood.
Still, etc.
The Merchant asked her,
what was that Anthony,
Quoth she, my Brother Sir,
who came from thence with me:
He did her entertain,
thinking she was a Boy,
Two years she did remain,
before she met her joy.
Still, etc.
Anthony up was taken
by an English Runagade,
With whom he did remain,
at the Sea roving trade:
In The nature of a slave,
he did in the Galley row,
Thus he his life did save,
but Constance did not know:
Sill she cries Anthony
my bonny Anthony,
Gang thou by Land or Sea,
I Will wend along with thee.
Now mark what came to pass,
see how the fates did work,
A Ship that her Masters was,
supriz'd this English Turk,
And into Bilbo brought
all that aboard her were,
Constance still little thought,
Anthony was so near.
Still, etc.
When they were come on shore
Anthony and the rest,
She who was sad before,
was now with joy possessed,
The Merchant much did muse,
at this so sudden change,
He did demand the News,
which unto ^im was strange:
Now she, etc.
Upon her knees she fell,
unto her Master kind,
And all the truth did tell,
nothing she kept behind:
At which he did admire,
and in a ship of Spain,
Not paying for their hire,
he sent them home again.
Now she, etc.
The Spanish Merchant rich,
did of's own bounty give
A sum of Gold on which
they now most bravely live:
And now in Westmoreland,
they were joined hand in hand
Constancy and Anthony,
they live in mirth and glee,
Now she says Anthony,
my bonny Anthony,
Good providence we see,
has guarded thee and me.
FINIS.
