The Enchanted LOVER, Or, Celia Triumphant. Being a most pleasant new Court
Song.
Conquered by love enchanted Strephon sings,
Whilst the loves god his flames fans with his wings,
And makes him Celia praise unto the Skies,
Beauty and Celia now are all he cries,
Transported by his passion and her eyes,
Thus Amorous Youth are caught in Cupids net,
Which the enchanting fair Doves daily set.
To a pleasant new Playhouse Tune.






AH! how pleasant are the charms of Love,
which like Streams are always flowing
Ah! how pleasant are the Charms of Love,
which like Streams are always flowing,
So my passion s still a growing,
nothing but my Celia's eyes can move,
So my passion's still a growing,
perfect and immortal as the joys above.
When Celia did my heart surprise,
every Siniew felt a pleasure,
Each kind look from her oblieging ere
filled my heart with endless Treasure:
Love, O Love, is the only treasure,
Joy and Blessing from the Brave and Wise,
Give me Love, one Life, and Pleasure,
Shall never end what the World enjoys.
Ah! how ravishing is the delight
how transporting is the pleasure,
And what are the Charms that do invite
when each smile's a boundless treasure,
That exceeds the Indian Ocean,
or all the Riches that the World can give,
Her eyes sparkle in the motion
like the Heavenly sires that do sorever live.
Oh still in the Groves I sing her praise
whilst the Birds the same returning,
Loudly warble forth fair Celias lays,
and the Lark sings every morning,
Grateful Tunes of sweetest number,
for to raise my Celia from her ease,
So to shake off her soft slumber,
and all the gentle fancies that to her seize.




Ah how like the Snow are Celia's Breasts
which do charm with pleasant panting,
There the god of love his head does rest,
nor can sleep those pillows wanting,
Whilst her breath the Air perfuming.
Balm forth from her Coral Lips does flow
Which like Spices when they are blooming,
round about the world fragrant sweets do throw
Her fair Tresses like Sunbeams do shine
with which amorous Winds still playing,
Make her for to look far more divine,
whilst devotion I am paying
And to pleasures am aspiring
as there is nothing more has power to move,
Nor on Earth that is worth desiring,
is there ought I can compare with Celias love
Ah my Celia pride of all her Set,
beauty's boast and chiefest treasure,
To whom Venus does all things anex,
to complete her all of pleasure,
That the joys above resembled,
in a mortal once again does dwell,
Where all virtues are assembled
perfect in themselves and that all else excel.
Which the world beside has power to give,
Oh my Celia fair and charming,
By whose smiles alone I live
whose eyes like the Sun are warming,
But when in my Arms embracing
Oh then let my silence speak the joy,
For it is far beyond expressing,
sure such blessed transports never yet could cloy.
All upon each pleasant Tree her name
in cool shades I still am carding,
That for evermore may live her Fame,
though far less than she is deserving,
Whilst the Nymphs they do sit singing,
and the pleasant Roses on her shed,
Endless joys are ever springing,
and a thousand blessings are around her spreed.
Each Shepherd does gaze with dazledeyes,
to see her face like Sun arising,
Cast a bright Reflection on the Skies
or as a Comet that is surprising
Causes wonder, as she passes
all the Woods and Groves resound her prasse
Chaunted forth by Nymph-like Lasses,
who for evermore unto her yield the Baye^
Then let Celia ever happy be,
Ay thrice happy in enjoying,
And to love for ever be she free
to loves power there is no denying,
Then let no one envy this my Treasure
in the which I still content do find;
Endless joys and endless pleasure
which can never fade whilst Celia proves kind.
