Covetous-minded Parents, O.R, The Languishing young Gentlewoman
Whose Friends would have her Marry an old Miser for the sake of his Gold,
which she utterly refused to do, resolveing to be true to the first.

Tune is, Farewell my dearest Dear.
Licensed according to Order.





I Am a Damosel fair
of blooming Beauty;
Therefore I do declare
it is my Duty
My Parents to obey,
Father and Mother;
They Would have me Marry Gray,
I love another.
Gray has five Thousand Pound,
in ready Money;
There Riches does abound,
but yet my Honey
Whom I shall still adore,
brings Love and Pleasure,
The which I value more
than Gold and Treasure.
Good God what shall I do,
whom shall I matry?
Father and Mother too
constantly weary
Their Child to entertain
this wretched Miser;
For which they are to blame,
would they were wiser.




What are those baggs of Gold
without a Blessing?
My Dearest Love behold
he is possessing
My heart and all that is dear,
how can I leave him?
Heaven may prove severe
it I deceive him.
Before my Vow I Will break,
Death shall destroy me:
I will no other take,
he must enjoy me.
Though Friends continually
scorn and deride me;
With him I Will Live and dye,
what e're betide me.
Though Gray has Riches store,
my Dear's above him;
Nay, had he ten times more,
I could not love him:
His Gold I count but dross,
dregs of confusion,
Which often proves a cross
in the conclusion.
Gold, Pearl and Silver bright
I never desire
Give me my hearts delight,
whom I admire;
That Treasure I Would enjoy,
my sweetest jewel:
What grief will me destroy,
Parents are cruel.
Though tedious Nights I spend
in mournful weeping;
My Heart, entire Friend,
thou have in keeping:
Bear up a cheerful mind,
let nothing grieve thee;
It I was not confined,
I Would never leave thee.
When my free liberty
once I recover;
I Will quickly be with thee
my loyal lover.
Though now with bitter mean,
grief does annoy me,
No man but thee alone
e're shall enjoy me.
