Amyntas and Claudia:
Or, The Merry Shepherdess, S^^^^ig whatever he from Virtue did not draw,
She circumvented with a ha, ha, ha,

To the Tune, called, Calm was the Evening, and Clear was the Sky.




CAlm was the Evening and clear was the Sky
when the new budding flowers do spring,
When all alone went Amyntas and I,
to hear the sweet Nightingals sing;
I sat and he laid him down by me,
and scarcely his breath he could draw,
But when with a fear,
He begun to draw near,
He was dashed with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
He blushed to himself, and lay still for a while
and his modesty curbed his desire,
But strait I convinced all his fears with a smile
and added new flames to his fire:
Ah Silvia said he thou art cruel,
to keep thy poor lover in awe,
And once more he pressed,
His hands to my breast,
But was dashed with a, etc.
I know 'twas his passion which caused all his fear
and therefore I pitied his case,
I whispered him softly, there was no body near,
and I laid my cheek close to his face;
But as he grew bolder and bolder,
a Shepherd came by us and saw,
And just as our bliss.
Began with a kiss.
He burst out, etc.
Come my own dear, Iets retire a while,
and hasten us down to the Grove,
Wherein some shade:
That nature has made,
We Will make a rehearsal of love,
And when with love tales we a^e tired,
and occasion does bid us withdraw,
We then from our seat,
Will make a retreat,
And laugh out, etc.


I Having consented, away we did go,
and found out the thick of the Wood;
But when we came there,
I began for to fear,
His meaning portended no good:
My beauty likewise he would oftentimes praise
for the rarest that ever he saw,
And there he would skip,
From my hand to my lip.
but was dashed with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
Sometimes he would sigh, and sometimes he would weep
and pray me to pity his case;
But I found out by that
What he would be at,
His meaning I read in his face;
I bid him desist and give over his suit,
For I told him my Will was a law,
And if he were pleased
To have his pain eased.
He must laugh. etc.
You know said Amyntas how long I have loved,
and ever restrain my desire,
And now with your scorn,
Which cannot be born,
You seek to extinguish my fire;
My virtue will justify all that I do,
to keep you at distance and awe:
And your loose desire,
Will sooner expire,
Then mirth, etc.
He sat like a Mute, and was still for a while,
consulting what answer to make,
When all in have,
He embraced my VVast,
And no more my denyals would take.
He vowed though my heart it were frozen,
his endeavor he would use, it to thaw;
If the heat of your blood,
Could do any good.
Which made, etc.
I found that his passion began to Rebel,
and Reason no more could prevail,
Thought I to my self,
I am now on a shelf.
And know not which way for to sail;
But if by my Policy I can get off,
and my honor preserve without flaw,
I Will engage me no more,
On such dangerous shore,
But at home, etc.
I used some persuasions that Evening was ni^^,
for the Sun it began to decline,
And fearing some Swain,
Of the Neighboring plain,
Might come for to water his Kine;
I pray's him return and walk softly along,
when 'twas dark i would submit to his law,
Where in my own Bower,
For the space of an hour
He should kiss, etc.
His thoughts being transported with joy, he conceived,
never feared, but my promise i would keep
But instead of a Wench,
He found such a Trench.
As charmed all his senses a sleep:
The virtue whereof through his vitals dispersed
and his faculties purer did draw;
And when I had done,
Away I did run,
And laughed out with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
