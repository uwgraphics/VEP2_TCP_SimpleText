(...) ^ew Ballad of Tobias: Wherein is showed the wonderful things which
(...) to him in his youth; and how he wedded a young Damsel that had had seven
Husbands, and never enjoyed their company: Who were all slain by a wicked
Spirit.


^N Ninive old Toby dwelt,
an aged bran and blind was he,
^o much affliction he had felt,
which brought him unto poverty.
(...) had by Anna his true wife,
(...)only son and eke no more,
which was the comfort of his life,
and he by him did set great store.
(...) brought him up most virtuously,
(...) true obedience and awe,
and every day he did apply,
(...) fear the Lord and keep his Law.
^n a time it come to pass,
^e called him his son wih speed,
thus to him his words did frame
^^n quoth he, thou know my need
(...) must unto Gabael go,
(...) ^aguels house in Media Land,
(...) ^id lend him long ago,
^ents on his only band.
(...) dear, Tobias said,
(...) ^ommand straight will I go,
(...) I get the money paid
^^e man I did nere know:
^^^e the writings then quoth he,
(...) is sufficient being seen,
(...) a guide to go with thee,
(...) that way have never brene.
(...) ^^^ias son had got,
(...) in the shape of man,
(...) he did not know, God wot,
^^d did so appoint it than.
^^^^as with his blessed guide,
^^nt on his journey then with speed,
(...) they came to Tygris side
(...) ^^at fair flood they did abide,
Tobias would go wash him there,
by reason of the Summers heat,
A mighty fish put him fear,
which lept out of the waters great,
Cut up the fish, the Angel said,
but keep the Liver, Heart, and Gall,
To do the same be not afraid,
great cures there shall be don withal.
When this was don, away they went,
and coming near their iourneies end:
Weel lodge to night the Angel said,
with Raguel thy fathers friend.
He has a daughter fair of face,
and also of a virtuous life,
And when we come into that place,
I Will speak that she may be thy wife.
Why Azarias then, quoth he
so Tobie did the Angel call;
I wis she is no wife for me,
swift death does to her Lovers fall.
Seven men have to her married been,
which in her love did take delight,
When her bedchamber they have seen,
they have not liv^d out half the night.
A wicked spirit loves her so,
he will not suffer any man,
With her into the bed to go,
but works his death do what he can.
The Angel said good courage take,
for so it shall not be with thee
For such perfumes I will thee make,
the wicked Spirit away shall flee.
To Raguels house away they went
where Sara met them fair and bright,
And after salutations done,
she brought him to her Parents sight.


GReat cheer they made, and down they sat
and all for young Tobias sake,
And after long and pleasant chat,
belwixt these two a match they make.
By Moses law they married were,
the Brides bed chamber prepared likewise,
When young Tobias came in there,
the tears fell down from Sara's eyes.
A Pan of Coals he brought with him,
the Fishes Heart and Liver there,
Which in that fire he did cast in,
which cast a sabour every where.
And by that sweet and precious smell,
the wicked spirit ws displaced,
Within that room he could not dwell,
whereout away he went in have.
In bed they laid the beauteous Bride,
the chamber door they shut therefore,
Young Toby lay down by her side,
whom he did think to see no more,
And therefore Raguel in the night,
for him before had made a grave,
And to his wife he wept and sa^d,
there is no means his life to save.
One of the Maidens send quoth he,
to see how all the matter stands,
If it be so that dead he be,
he shall be buried by my hands.
The Maiden joyful news did bring,
Tobias is alive quoth she,
When Raguel then heard of this thing,
he did rejoice exceedingly.
For joy he made a solemn feast,
the Bridal fourteen days he kep^
Thereto came many a friendly gue^^
in sorrow now no more they sle^^
Then Azaris went straight way,
and to the feast Gabael brought,
Rejoicing at this marriage day,
did pay the money which he ought,
But yet old Toby and his wife,
did all the time in sorrow dwell,
They thought their son had lost his life,
and nothing could their grief expel.
His aged mother every day,
did watch long the highway side.
And for his welfare often did pray,
no meat nor drink she could abide.
But when the wedding ended was,
young Toby with his lovely Bride,
To Ninive did homeward pass,
with goods and cattle on each side.
But Toby and the Angel bright,
before his wife made haste to go,
For to prepare all things aright,
his lovely Bride to welcome tho.
His mother watching in the way,
full soon espide her tender son,
Rejoicing at the happy day,
she told her husband he was come.
Whereat old Toby stumbled out
for he was blind and could (...)
Young Toby with the fish^^ (...)
rubbed both his eyes (...)
Whereat the whit^^^^^ (...)
incontinent (...)
So that before (...)
