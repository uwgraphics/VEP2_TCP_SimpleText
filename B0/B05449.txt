A PROCLAMATION Against Conventicles, and other Disorders.
CHARLES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith,
To (...) Macers, or Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part conjunctly
and severally, specially constitute, Greeting:
Forasmuch, as by many renewed Acts of Parliament, and former Proclamations,
with advice of Our Privy Council; We have manifested Our Religious and Princely
care and zeal for the interests of the Protestant Reformed Religion, and of the
Church: And considering, how much it imports the glory of Almighty GOD, as well
as the interest and service of Our Crown, that all due Obedience be paid to
such Laws, as provide for the securing of the same, by Unity in Worship, and by
procuring of all due Reverence to Our Archbishops and Bishops, and the other
sub-ordinat Officers of the Church: And withal, the sad and sensible decays
Religion has of late suffered, and the great and dangerous increase of
Profannesse through the most unreasonable and Schismatical separation of many,
from the public and established Worship, and the frequent and open
Conventicles both in houses and fields, by such as thereby discover their
disaffection to the established Religion, and their undutieful aversion to Our
Authority and Government, whereby the Peace of the Kingdom is endangered, and
the Church divided, and under pretense of Scruple, Faction advanced. And We,
having cause to apprehend, that these insolent Disorders, have flowed from
their abusing of Our Royal Clemency and Indulgence, and from the flow, remiss
and unsteddy execution of Our good and wholesome Laws; And being desirous, that
all Our good Subjects may take notice, how serious and resolute We are to
assert and maintain the true Religion, and the Unity and established Order of
the Church, Do, with advice of Our Privy Council, require, and command all Our
Officers, and others entrusted for that effect, to put the Laws and
Proclamations relating to the Church, to due and vigorous execution, both
against Papists, and all other Schismatical Dissenters and Disturbers of the
Peace thereof. And further, We do particularly require the Magistrates of the
several Burghs to seize upon any Persons that are, or, hereafter shall be
intercommoned and remove out of their several Towns and Jurisdictions, the
Families of such as are intercommoned, or declared Fugitives or Rebels; and
all such Preachers, as with their Families do not attend the Public Worship,
and that betwixt and the first day of June next: And We do require all
Noblemen, Gentlemen, and all other Subjects without Burgh, and all Magistrates,
and other persons within Burgh, That they do not Intercommon, Harbor, nor
Relieve any of the Persons, who are, or shall be Intercommoned, under the pains
due to Intercommoners by Law. And declare, that if any person shall discover
any Heritor, Life-renter, or other Person without Burgh, or any Magistrate, or
other Inhabitants within Burgh; who shall Intercommon, Harbor, or Relieve any
so Intercommoned, shall have for such discovery made, the sum of five hundred
merks, instantly paid to them out of Our Thesaury. And whereas, by the
seventeenth Act of the third Session of Our second Parliament, all Sheriffs,
Stewarts, Lords of Regalities, and Magistrates of Burghs, are obliged to give
an account of their diligence, in putting the Acts relating to Conventicles,
and Separation into due execution, to Our Privy Council yearly, on the first
thursday of July, under the pain of five hundred merks for each years faylie:
We declare, that We will call them to an account of their diligence, and
punish their negligence accordingly. And further, We declare, That the
Magistrates of all Royal Burghs, wherein any Conventicles shall be hereafter
kept, shall be fined in the sum of five hundred merks for each Conventicle,
and that by and attour any other fine to be imposed by Our Privy Council upon
them; For which by Act of Parliament, they are to have relief from the persons
present at the said Conventicle: and that five hundred merks shall be the least
sum to be exacted from any Burgh for every Conventicle, and which shall be
augmented on the Burghs more considerable: For which sum, they are to have no
Relief, either from the Common good of the Towns, nor from the Persons found at
these Conventicles. And whereas, by Our former Proclamation of the date, the
Eighth day of Apryle, one thousand six hundred and sixty nine, all Heritors in
whose Lands any Conventicles are kept, are lyeable to the Fynes, Pains, and
Penalties therein contained: We hereby declare, that in like-manner, these
Heritors of Houses, within Burghs of Royalty, Regality, or Barrony, in whose
Houses any Conventicle shall be kept after the first day of June next, shall
be fined in a whole years Rent of the said Tenement, where the Conventicle
shall be kept, and whereof the Landlord shall have no relief from the
Tennent, or Possessor, and this, toties, quoties, for every Conventicle kept
therein. And further, for preventing of all disorderly Marriages and Baptisms,
We do hereby declare, That We will take care that the thirty fourth Act of the
first Session of Our first Parliament, and the sixth Act of the second Session
of Our second Parliament, be put into due execution against the contraveeners
thereof. And, for the encouragement of those who shall delate or inform, a
proportionable part of the Fynes of these who shall be found guilty, shall be
granted and allowed to them for their service therein. And whereas, by the
fourth Act of the second Session of Our first Parliament, It is Statute, that
none be allowed to teach any Schools, or be Pedagogues to Children of Persons
of Quality, or Chaplains in any Family, without a License from the respective
Ordinaries, We, do hereby Require and Command, that none hereafter intertain
any Schoolmaster, Pedagogue or Chaplain, or person for performance of Family
Worship, who have no such License under the hands of the respective Bishops:
And that under the penalty of three thousand merks to be exacted from each
Nobleman, and twelve hundred merks from each Gentleman, and six hundred merks
from a Burges, or any other Subject, toties, quoties, as they shall be found
guilty herein. And that Our Royal pleasure in the premises may be made public
and known, OUR WILL IS, and We charge you straightly and command, that
incontinent their Our Letters seen, ye pass, to the Market Cross of Edinburgh,
and remanent Head-Burghs of the Shires of this Kingdom, and other places
needful; and thereat, in Our Name and Authority, by open Proclamation, make
publication of Our Royal peasure in the premises, That all Our Subjects may
have due and timous notice thereof, and give Obedience thereto, according to
Justice, as ye will answer to Us thereupon. The which to do We commit to you,
conjunctly and severally, Our full power by their Our Letters, delivering them
be you duly execute, and indorsat again to the bearer.

Given under Our Signet, At Edinburgh, the first day of March, 1676. And of Our
Reign the twenty eight year. Tho. Hay, Cl. Sti Concilii.
