AN ELEGY, Upon that Incomparable Comedian, Mr. EDWARD ANGEL.
Written by C. B.
HAng the Stage all in black; this sable night
Has brought a deluge, caused an Angels flight.
Before Creation, Heaven lost an Angel thence;
Our Stage's Angel has made his Exit hence.
His pregnant Actions of Transcendant Wit,
Rung Peals of Mirth, in Gallery, Box, and Pit.
He was the best of Mimiques, and took's Degree
Master of Art, in every Comedy.
To hear his Mimick voice, which did dispense
Divertisement to all Spectators sense.
It filled 'em with amazement to behold,
What actions sprung from his corporeal mold.
His loss is felt at Court, where it does move
The Great Ones there, like the true Soul of Love.
The City too bewails: And now in lieu
Of former Mirth, from them drop showers of Dew.
He was the Poets Darling, not one but wears
Clouds on his brow, his eyes flow seas of tears.
The Actors all, at Fate's so swift command,
Are turned some Ghosts; others like Statues stand.
Who shall play Stephano now? your Tempest's gone,
To raise new Storms in the hearts of every one.
Farewell Dufoy; That Comical revenge,
That always pleasing Play, is now unhinged.
Adieu, dear Friskin: Unfort'nate Lovers weep,
Your mirth is fled, and now in the Grave must sleep.
No more to Epsom; Physicians try your skills,
Since Frible now has ta'n his leave of the Wells.
His parts too numerous were for Elegy,
And Scenes too Comical to be ex^^ess'd by me:
Let best of Poets do it, it shall suffice
I on thy Grave this Epitaph Incize:
EPITAPH.
Here lies Ned Angel, who ruled, as he thought fit,
The English Stage of Comic, Mimick Wit. 211.
