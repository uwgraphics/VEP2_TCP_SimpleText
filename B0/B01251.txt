BY THE KING.
A Proclamation for the further adiournment of Michaelmasse Term.
WHereas our gracious Sovereign Lord the Kings Majesty, taking into His
Princely consideration the health and safety of His loving Subjects, and how
much they might be endangered by the great and general infection of the
Plague, which has been long in the Cities of London and Westminster, and the
places nere adjoining, if by their services, suits, or other causes occasioned
by the Term they should be drawn thither before that heavy visitation should
by the mercy of God be removed: Did therefore by His Royal Proclamation dated
the fourth day of September now last past signify His pleasure, That part of
the Term of S. Michael then next coming should be adjourned; That is to say,
from the Vtas thereof unto the fourth return of the same Term called Mense
Michaelis. Now His Majesty foreseeing, that although by Gods mercy that
grievous sickness is much assuaged in those Cities and parts adjoining, yet the
danger thereof would be very great to His whole Kingdom, in dispersing the
infection, and would longer continue the peril thereof in those places
already infected by the concourse of so many from all parts of the Kingdom,
whom the businesses of the Term must necessarily draw together; Does therefore
hereby declare His pleasure to be, That at the said return called Mense
Michaelis, the said Term be again adjourned until the next return after,
being the fifth return of the said Term called Crastino Animarum, and that at
the said adjournment the Term be also adjourned from the City of Westminster,
unto the Town of Reading, in the County of Berke, and there continued for the
residue of the said Term, where His Will is, that all His loving Subjects of
this Realm, whom it may any way concern, do take notice. And His Majesty's
pleasure is, That one of His Justices of either Bench on that day of Mense
Michaelis, according to the ancient order of the Laws, keep the Essoynes of
the said return of Mense Michaelis, at which time Writs of adjournment (which
His Majesty hereby commands the Lord Keeper of His Great Seal of England to
make forth) shall be directed to the said Justices, giving them authority to make
such further adjournment as aforesaid. And further His Majesty's pleasure is,
that all matters, causes and suits depending in any of His other Courts of
Star Chamber, Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liveries, Duchy of Lancaster,
and Court of Requests shall have continuance, and the parties shall have day
from the said fourth Return called Mense Michaelis, until the said fifth
Return called Crastino Animarum. And whereas His Majesty by His said former
Proclamation did direct, That all Collectors, Sheriffs, and other Accomptants,
and all other persons that should or ought to account for, or pay any sum or
sums of money in any of His Majesty's Courts of Exchequer, Courts of Wards
and Liveries, and of His Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter
into any account in any of the said Courts, should repair unto His Majesty's
house of Richmond, as though no such Proclamation of adiournment had been had
or made; Now His Majesty's pleasure is, and he does hereby direct and command,
that at and from the said Return of Crastino Animarum, all Collectors,
Receivers, Sheriffs, and other accomptants, and all other persons that should
or ought to account for or pay any sum or sums of money in any of the
places aforesaid, shall give their attendance at the Town of Reading
aforesaid, and there make their payments, and enter into, and prosecute their
accounts, as they ought to have done at the Receipt at Westminster. And lest
the ouer-hastie resort of Strangers to the said Cities of London and
Westminster, and places near adjoining, and the intercourse of trade between
those Cities and places adjoining, and other Cities, Towns, and places of this
Kingdom more remote, might be an occasion of spreading the infection into
other parts and places not yet infected, and of continuing it the longer where
it is already, which would hinder his Majesty's repair to those Cities, and be
an impediment to other matters of importance, for the benefit and comfort of
those Cities, whereas the forbearance for a while might avail to their mutual
good and safety. His Majesty does hereby not only advise, but straightly
charge and command all persons, whose proper habitations are not in those
Cities of London and Westminster, or places near adjoining, to forbear to
reside there, or resort thither. And that all Carriers either by Land or by
Water, with horse, Wayne, Cart, Wagon, Boat, Barge, or other Vessel, do
forbear to carry any wares, merchandise, or other things (other then victuals
only) unto, or from the said Cities of London and Westminster, or Suburbs
thereof, until the peril of the contagion be better past over, and by the
coldness of the weather the Air be cleansed, and the danger removed, and his
Majesty's further pleasure be known herein. And lest the said Town of
Reading, which is now free from the sickness, may it self be endangered, or
endanger others resorting thither by fetching of wares from places now or
lately infected; His Majesty does straightly charge and command all and every the
Inhabitants of the said Town, and all other places within three miles thereof,
that they wholly forbear to buy or receive any wares or merchandise from the
said Cities of London and Westminster, or places adjoining, or from any other
place now or lately infected with that contagious sickness, until the end of
the said Term of S. Michaell a the soonest. And his Majesty does straightly
charge and command the Mayor of the said Town of Reading, and the Justices of
peace inhabiting within the hundreds of Reading, Bunning, and Thele in the said
County of Berke, that they with all diligence see his Majesty's pleasure
observed herein.

Given at the Court at Salisbury the eleventh day of October, in the first
year our reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
