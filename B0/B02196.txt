the Lord: and they swear. ISAIAH 44. 5. One shall say, I am the Lords, another

again by all sorts of persons in the Year 1590, by a new ordinance of
Counsel, at the desire of the National Assembly; and renewed by the Kings
Commissioner and Counsel and National Assembly in the Year 1638. and again

The Confession of Faith OF The Kirk of SCOTLAND.
WE All, and every one of Us underwritten, Protest; that after long and due
Examination of our own conscience, in matters of true and false Religion, are
now thoroughly resolved of the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of GOD, and
therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subscribe with
our hands, and constantly affirm before God, and the whole World: that this
only is true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God and bringing Salvation
to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world, by the
preaching of the blessed Evangell, And received, believed, and defended, by
many and sundry notable Kirkes and Realms, but chiefly by the Kirk of
Scotland, the Kings Majesty, and three estates of this Realm, as Gods
eternal Truth, and only ground of our Salvation: as more particularly is
expressed in the Confession of our Faith, stablished, and publicly confirmed
by sundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a long time has been openly
professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of this Realm both in Burgh
and Land. To the which Confession and form of Religion, we willingly agree
in our consciences in all points, as unto Gods undoubted Truth and Verity,
grounded only upon his written Word. And therefore, we abhor and detest all
contrary Religion, and Doctrine: But chiefly, all kind of Papisterie, in
general and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the
Word of God, and Kirk of Scotland: but in special we detest and refuse the
usurped authority of that Roman Antichrist upon the Scriptures of God, upon
the Kirk, the civil Magistrate, and consciences of men: All his tyranous laws
made upon indifferent things against our Christian liberty: His erroneous
Doctrine, against the sufficiency of the written Word, the perfection of the
Law, the office of Christ, and his blessed Evangell: His corrupted Doctrine
concerning original sin, our natural inabilitie and rebellion to Gods Law,
our Justification by Faith only, our imperfect Sanctification and obedience to
the Law, the nature, number and use of the Holy Sacraments; His five bastard
Sacraments, with all his Ri^es, Ceremonies, and false Doctrine, added to the
ministration of the true Sacraments without the Word of God: His cruel
judgment against Infants departing without the Sacrament: his absolute
necessity of Baptism: his blasphemous opinion of Transubstantiation, of real
presence of Christ's body in the Elements, and receiving of the same by the
wicked, or bodies of men: His dispensations with solemn Oaths, Perjuries, and
degrees of Marriage forbidden in the Word: his cruelty against the innocent
divorced: his divellish Mass: his blasphemous Priesthood: his profane
Sacrifice for the sins of the dead: his Canonization of men, calling upon
Angels or Saints departed, worshipping of Imagerie, Relicts, and Crosses,
dedicating of Kirks, Altars, Days, Vows to creatures; his Purgatory, Prayers
for the dead, praying, or speaking in a strange language, with his Processions
and blasphemous Letanie, and multitude of Advocates or Mediators: his manifold
Orders, Auricular Confession: his desperate and uncertain Repentance; his
general and doubtsome Faith; his satisfactions of men for their sins: his
Justification by works, opus operatum, works of Supererogation, Merits,
Pardons, Peregrinations, and Stations: his holy Water, baptising of Bells,
conjuring of Spirits. crossing, saning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods
good creatures, with the superstitious opinion, joined therewieh: his wordlie
Monarchy, and wicked Hierarchy: his three solemn vows, with all his
shavellings of sundry sorts; his erreneous and bloody decrees made at Trent,
with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruel and bloody Band,
conjured against the Kirk of God: and finally, we detest all his vain
Allegories, Rites, Signs, and Traditions, brought in the Kirk, without, or
against the Word of God, and Doctrine of this true reformed Kirk; to the which
we join our selves willingly, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion, Discipline, and
use of the Holy Sacraments as lively members of the same, in Christ our Head:
promising, and swearing by the Great Name of the Lord our GOD, that we shall
continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, and
shall defend the same according to our Vocation and Power, all the days of our
lives, under the pains contained in the Law, and danger both of Body and
soul, in the day of Gods fearful Judgment: and seeing that many are stirred
up by Satan, and that Roman Antichrist, to promise, swear, subscribe, and for
a time use the holy Sacraments in the Kirk, deceitfullie, against their own
consciences, minding thereby, first, under the external cloak of Religion, to
corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true Religion within the Kirk, and
afterward, when time may serve, to become open enemies and persecutors of the
same, under vain hope of the Popes dispensation, devised against the Word of
God, to his greater confusion, and their double condemnation in the day of the
Lord LORD JESUS, We, therefore, willing to take away all suspicion of
hypocrisy, and of such double dealing with God and his Kirk, Protest, and call
The Searcher of all hearts for witness, that Our minds and hearts, do fully
agree with this our Consession, Promise, Oath and Subscription, so that We are
not moved for any wordlie respect, but are persuaded only in our Consciences,
through the knowledge and love of Gods true Religion, printed in Our hearts, by
the holy Spirit, as We shall answer to him in the day, when the secrets of all
hearts shall be disclosed. And because we cannot look for a blessing from
God upon our proceedings; except with our Profession and Subscription we join
such a life and conversation, as beseems Christians, who have renewed their
Covenant with God, We, therefore, faithfully promise, for our selves, our
followers, and all others under us, both in public, in our particular families
and personal carriage, to endeavor to keep our selves within the bounds of
Christian liberty, and to be good examples to others of all Godliness,
Soberness, and Righteousness, and of every duty we owe to God and Man, and
that this our Union and Conjunction may be observed without violation, We
call the living God, the Searcher of our Hearts, to witness, who knows this to
be our sincere Desire, and unfeigned Resolution, as we shall answer to JESUS
CHRIST, in the great day, and under the pain of Gods everlasting wrath, and of
infamy, and of loss of all honor and respect in this World: Most humbly
beseeching the LORD, to strengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end: and to
bless our desires and proceedings with a happy success, that Religion and
Righteousness may flourish in the Land, to the glory of God, the honor of our
King, and peace and comfort of us all. In witness whereof we have subscribed with
our hands all the premises.
