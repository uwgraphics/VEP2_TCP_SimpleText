portrait of Charles I

Come hither to me and I will declare
with a fa la la la lalero.
How cruel hearted Tyrants are,
with la, etc.
Of those that did presume so high,
To murder our good Kings Majesty,
Now may these Rebbels howl and cry,
with a fafa la la lalero.
He was a Prinne of courage stout,
with a fa, etc.
Although his glass was soon run out,
with a, fo, etc.
But behind him he has left a Noble stock,
May give a Traitor a handsome knock,
For making a King to submit to the block,
with a, fa, etc.
The blood (...) ^3 lost as I suppose,
with (...) ^c.
Caus^ (...) ^^se in Olivers nose,
(...)
His rousing Nose did bear such asway,
It cast such a heat in shining ray,
That England scarce knew the night from day
with a fa, etc.
Oliver was of Huntington,
with a fa, etc.
Born he was a Brewers son,
with a fa, etc.
He soon forsook his dray and slings,
And counted a Brewers house a pitiful thing
Then he came to the stately throne of a King,
with a fa, etc,
Oliver had a heart of gall,
with a fa, etc.
For to Murder his Prince at White Hall,
with a fa, etc.
He swore whoever was over the mane,
Whither a French King or a Spain,
Yet in England no King should remain,
with a fa, etc.
The second part,
To the same Tune.


DUke Humphery was the first protector
with a fa, etc.
Henry the sixth the next Protector,
with a fa, etc.
Then thirdly Oliver he took place,
But Lucifer soon removed his grace,
Then he set up yonog Dick the fool of his race
with a fa, etc.
No sooner was Dick got up to the throne,
with a fa, etc.
But he considered it was nane of own
with a fa, etc.
And staring this way and that way about.
Desiring to be resolved a doubt
Then in came Lambert and turned him out
with a fa, etc.
Fleetwood desirous of the place
with a fa, etc.
Sent forth Lambert the Scot to face,
with a fa, etc.
And being in the strenght of his desire,
When he did think poor Iocky to brier,
His men forsook him and left him in the mier
with a fa, etc.
Thus you may see how some do rise,
with a fa, etc.
With an intent to surmont the skies,
with a fa, etc.
But when they are up they shall have a fall,
Witness Flentwood blind Hewson and all
The raged rout of a Cobblers stall,
with a fa, etc.
We Will clear Whitehall of Lobsters and Geese
with a fa, etc.
Turn Rumps and Kidneys out of the house
with a fa, ande.
We Will bring in Chrls from over the main,
make wars with Franee and peace with Spain
Then we shall have money and trading again
with a fa, etc.
Citizens look to your selves I say,
with a fa, etc.
Let no Cobblers preach and pray,
with a fa, etc.
Tom Cobbler is flown the Lord knows whither
Fleetwood and he I hepe are together,
Now we have brought in the King and we'll have fair weather
with a fa, ande.
Blind Hewson was not of our kind,
with a fa, ande
To run away and leave his men behind,
with a fa, ande.
But I wish I could find him by the sent
there is neither ye law nor ye rump parliament
Should save him from death to give us content,
with a fa la la la lalero.
