A Pleasant JIGG Betwixt Jack and his Mistress:
Or, The young Carman's courage cooled by the sudden approach, of his Master,
who found him too kind to his Mistress.

Tune of Mary Live Long.
Licensed according to Order.



A Carmen of late,
Who lived in the city,
A sorrowful Dity,
His wife was too great
with their Prentice Boy,
But a swinging young Spark
At a wench in the dark,
Now this his Dame knew,
And therefore stout Johnny,
And therefore stout Johnny,
Must tickle her (...).


Sweet Mistress I fear,
A woeful disaster,
The wrath of me Master,
If once he should hear,
I played with your Lute,
He would li^uor my hide,
You're a fool, she replied,
Take courage for shame,
O fear not your Master,
Boy fear not your Master,
But pleasure your Dame.
I count it no crime,
To dally in pleasure,
We'll Toy out of measure,
It Is not the first time,
Nor sha'n't be the last,
Therefore come on my Boy,
Let us Pleasure enjoy,
Take courage for shame,
It Is sweet Recreation,
It Is sweet Recreation,
To pleasure thy Dame.
Thy Master, I Will swear,
If once he should Cavel,
We'll send to dig Gravel,
With Friends to Horn-Fair,
He dare not say no,
But at home we will stay,
Then in order to play,
The Froliksome Game,
Boy do not deny me,
John do not deny me,
But pleasure thy Dame,


It happened one day,
His Mistress came to him,
No question she knew him,
To be every way,
a Lad for her turn,
Where Is your Master, she cried?
With a friend* he replied;
She then void of shame,
Said Johnny come kiss me,
Sweet Johnny come kiss me,
Make much of thy Dame.


Thy corral and Bells,
And Whilstle I know it,
If thou will bestow it
For pleasures excells,
The lest in the Town,
Thou art Lusty and strong
And can lay me along,
Take Courage for shame,
Thou here in the Stable,
Thou here in the Stable,
Shall pleasure thy Dame.
His Master by chance,
Then being near them.
Did soon over-hear them,
And strait did advance,
With fury and Rage,
Like a Fellow Horn-mad,
He fell on the Lad,
His shoulders he paid,
'Cause John in his Pasture,
'Cause John in his Pasture,
a Tresspass had made.
Ah! what have thou done,
So sad a vexation,
Was never in the nation,
Horn-mad I shall run,
Without all dispute,
Oh ye villain said he,
I will not make you Free,
But bring you to shame,
Because you have wronged me,
Because you have wronged me,
and played with your Dame.
