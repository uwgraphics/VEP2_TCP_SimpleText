EDINBURGH, The seventeenth of November, one thousand six hundred and sixty
four.
FOrasmuch as it is notour, that diverse Ministers, who have gone off their
Charges, or are outed by Law, do ordinarily repair to Edinburgh, and other
Burghs and Places, expressly forbidden by Acts of Council, and do there, in open
contempt of His Majesty's Authority and Acts of Parliament and Council, hold
their meetings and keep seditions correspondences, and use contrivances for
seducing and debauching the Subjects from the duty and obedience they owe to
the Laws and Authority established, to the scandal of Religion, and endangering
of the publich Peace and Quiet. Therefore, the Lords of His Majesty's Privy
Council ordains a Macer to pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and in His
Majesty's Name and Authority, to command and charge, all those persons who have
been removed from the charge of the Ministry since the first of January, one
thousand six hundred and sixty one, to remove themselves out of the Burgh of
Edinburgh, within forty eight hours after publication hereof; and not to
repair or abide therein, or in other places prohibited by Act of Council, dated
the thirteenth of August, one thousand six hundred and sixty three, unless they
ask and obtain license, to go about their lawful business, from the Lords of
His Majesty's Privy Council, or from the Bishop of the Diocese: With
certification, that if after publication hereof, they be found to repair unto,
or abide in Edinburgh or other forbidden places foresaids, they shall be seized
upon and put in sure firmance, until they receive the punishment provided by
Law against the movers of sedition. And ordains these presents to be printed
and published, that none pretend ignorance.
