The King's Bench Cabal, A SONG.
To the Tune, hark, hark, I hear the Cannons rore.
I.
FTernal Whigs that still depends
On Old Sham-Plots and perjured ends,
Toth' King's Bench amongst your friends
Repair to make new Orders:
Make haste, contrive some better way,
Or by the Gods you will loose the day,
Great York is now above half way,
To Revenge all Rape and Murders.
II.
We Are the best House of Commons now,
That once have made three Kingdoms bow
Put in, spew out, as you know how,
fear Popery the old Notion:
Let Us purge the House of all that is good,
That have our Cause so long withstood,
And dares not thirst for guiltless blood,
Ever York's upon the Ocean.
III.
Great Hamden, Rouse, thy wonted strain,
Bring Trenchard into play again;
Vote down the guards and every swain,
That dares oppose our pleasure:
For to submit they would be loath,
Thy Father and thy Grand-Sire both,
To have ones hands tied up by Oath,
That may be loose at leisure.
IV.
Let Us Vote the Duke of the Town,
The King out of both Life and Crown,
Vote Death to all that keeps us down,
To leave the Cause a bleeding,
Shall we lie here tied up like Dogs,
Only Croaking our minds like Frogs,
While here the Doctor swears and flogs,
And leaves off all proceeding.
V.
Come Speak and Bradon, Arnold too,
Colt, and Caldron, what shall's do,
Shall's lie like Oysters here in stew?
And never look out for help for it;
Let Us send for Oxford Parliament,
With all their Guards for murder bent,
Come let us attempt ever Coin be spont,
Though each one Damn himself for it.
VI.
Shall we who were so great before,
Have neither power to plot nor whore,
Come let us resolve, break down the door,
And join the Kent-street Rabble.
Then Wapping and the Rump will rise,
The Tower and Westminster surprise,
While Charles and York at Windsor lies,
We'll make this Town like Babel.
