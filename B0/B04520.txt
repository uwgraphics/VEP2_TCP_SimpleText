The Northern Lasses lamentation, OR The unhappy Maids Misfortune
Since she did from her friends depart
No earthly thing can cheer her heart
But still she does her case Lament,
Being always filled with discontent,
Resolving to do naught but mourn,
Till to the North she does return
To the tune I would I were in my own Country.
With Allowance.





A North Country Lass
up to London did pass
Although with her Nature it did not agree
which made her repent
and so often Lament
Still wishing again in the North for to be,
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree
does flourish at home in my own Country.
fain would I be
in the North Country
Where the ladds and the lasses are making of hay
there should I see
what is pleasant to me
A mischief light on them enticed me away,
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree,
does flourish most bravely in our Country,
Since that I came forth
of the pleasant North
There Is nothing delightful I see does abound,
they never can be
half so merry as we
When we are a dancing of Sellingers round.
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree,
does flourish at home in our own Country.
I like not the Court
nor the City resort
Since there no fancy for such maids as me,
their pomp and their pride
I can never abide
Because with my humor it does not agree
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree,
does flourish at home in my own country.
How often have I been
On the Westmorland green
Where the young men and Maidens resort for to play
where we with delight
from morning till night
Could feast it and Frollick on each Holliday
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree,
They flourish most bravely in our country.
A Milking to go
All the Maids on a row
It was a fine sight and pleasant to see.
but here in the City
they are void of pity
There is no in enjoyment of Liberty,
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree,
They flourish most bravely in our Country.
When I had the heart
From my friends to depart
I though I should be a Lady at last
but now I do find
that it troubles my mind
Because that my joys and my pleasure is past,
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Jvy Tree,
They fl^urish at home, etc.
The yows and the Lambs
With the Kidds and their Damms
To see in the Country how finely they play
the Bells they do ring
and the Birds they do sing
And the fields and the gardens so pleasant and (...)
O the Oak, and the Ash, and the bonny Jvy (...)
They flourish most bravely in our Country.
At Wakes and at Fairs
Being void of all cares.
we there with our Lovers did use for to dance,
then hard hap had I
my ill fortune to try
And so up to London my steps to advance,
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Ivy Tree
They, etc.
Yet still I perceive
I a husband might have
If I to the City my mind could but frame,
but i will have a Lad
That is North-Countrey bred
Or else i will not marry inth' mind that I am.
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Ivy Tree
They flourish, etc.
A maiden I am
And a maid i will remain
Until my own Country again I do see
for here in this place
I shall ner' see the face
Of him that is allotted my Love for to be.
O the Oak, the Ash, and the bonny Ivy Tree
They flourish, etc.
Then farwell my Daddy
Ind f^rwel my Mammy,
Until I do see you I nothing but mourn
Remembering my Brothers
my Sisters and others,
In less than a year I hope to return.
Then the Oak and Ash, and the bonny Ivy Tree,
I shall see them at home in my own Country.
