THE PSALMS OF DAVID IN MEETER: By Mr. ZACHARY BOYD, Preacher of GODS Word.

The second edition.

PSALM. 119. verse. 54. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my
pilgrimage.

PSALM. 34. verse. 2. (...)

Printed at Glasgow, by George Anderson, 1646.

To the Reader.
IN this second edition where it might be conveniently done, I have made the
paraphrase sho^ter; but by reason that a work of this sort is for a people and
children who are rude, whereof many can not read, but sing after the line is
read, I have shunned to be too concise, lest brevitie should breed obscurity
and many should sing without understanding: where two verses might be
conveniently joined in four lines, I have striven to do it; but when I saw that
either it made the verse harsh or obscure, or that it behooved me to seek
other words then the words of the text, I rather choised to make the
paraphrase a little wider, for to keep so far as I could the words of the
text, which is the most acurat version, in my judgment, that hitherto has
been.

In some places obscure, I have striven to make the paraphrase like a
commentary, as for example, PSALM. 76.4. Thou art more glorious and excellent
then the mountains of prey.

By those mountains of prey, the Psalmist understands the enemies of Gods
people that made the mountains their strength, and from thence came to spoil
them: like those rebels and robbers that from the mountains of Scotland have
murdered and spoiled Gods Saints, and made a prey of them; but this is our
comfort, GOD is more glorious and excellent then the mountains of prey; God at
last will destroy them, for PSALM. 95.4. The strength of the hills is his.

The Paraphrase.

Thou surely art more glorious
and excellent always,
Then the most mighty foes that be
in mountains seeking prey.
Likewise, PSALM. 87.7. As well singers as the players on instruments shall be
there, All my springs are in thee: Those last words, all my springs are in
thee, are difficle to many; The Herbew is Col-majane bach, that is, Omnes
fontes mei in te, that is, All my fountains or well-springs are in thee; By
those springs are understood the affections of the heart, whence spring out the
praises of the Lord, as out of a fountain.

The Paraphrase.

Both singers there and players als
on instruments shall be,
All my best hearts affections
as well-springs are in theee.
So have I done in diverse other places to make all clear and plain for the
peoples use: As for some hard passages where I found great diversity of
opinions of worthy learned men, suspending my judgment, did strive to keep the
words of the text, as PSALM. 110.3. In the beauties of holiness, from the womb
of the morning thou have the dew of thy youth.

Some take the beauties of holiness to be the ornaments of the Sanctuary:
others refer them to the holy graces and virtues wherewithal the faithful
should be beautified.

As for those words, From the womb of the morning thou have the dew of thy
youth, they are very hard; Some by the womb of the morning understand the
essence of the Godhead, that was early in the morning, before the world was
made denoting the eternal generation of Christ; This seems to have been the
mind of the Septuagint, whose words are those, Of the womb before the
morning Star begat I thee, Some take those words to be spoken of Christ's
manhood, who had the dew of his birth of the obscure womb of the Virgin;
Some, which I like best, interpret this of Christ's Church, which is said, From
the womb of the morning to have the dew of her youth, that is, as the dew in
the morning, air is bred, as in a a womb, and falls down in many drops, so
the children of God, the elected Ones shall in the Church be borne in great
number by thee preaching of the Gospel: Others give other interpretations;
because of such a diversity of opinions, I would not change a word of the text.

The Paraphrase.

In beauties of great holiness
with a most pleasant show,
From the fair mornings womb thou have
ev^n of thy youth the dew.
Likewise, there is a great diversity of opinions concerning those words,
PSALM. 24.6. This is the generation of them that seek him: that seek thy face, O
Jacob. In the Hebrew, it is Mebakshe-Panecha-Jacob; Some turn it of Jacob,
some in Jacob, and so refer it to ^ true Israelites; Others, as our new versi^^
which is most acurat, has O Jacob, me^ning, as it is well marked on the marge^
O GOD of Jacob, which interpretation seems most fitting for the words: I ha^^
kept the words of the new version ^^ceived by our Church.

The Paraphrase.

This is the generation now
of them that in each place
Him seek; O Jacob, that always
do humbly seek thy face.
Those second labors as I did with the former, I in all humility submit to
the judgment of my reverend brethren in the Ministry, The Spirits of the
Prophets are subject to the Prophets 1 COR. 14.32.

THE PSALMS OF DAVID.
PSALM I.
Blessed is the man that walks not in
th'ungodlies counsel ill,
Nor stands in ways of sinners, nor
in scorners seats sit still.

Nor in the righteous company
the sinners shall have place.

even of the righteous all:
But the way of ungodly men
most surely perish shall.
PSALM. II.
WHy do the heathen fiercely rage,
and people als profane
Imagine in their foolish hearts
a thing that is most vain?

and Rulers that are here,
Against GOD together counsel take,
and his Anointed dear.

And from us also all their cords
let us now cast away.

The Lord in wrath shall them at last
have in derision all.

and them vex sore he will:

Sion, my holy Hill.

the LORD has said, to me,
Thou surely art my Son, this day
have I begotten thee.

for heritage to thee,
The utmost parts of all the earth
shall thy possession be.

thou shall soon break them small,
Thou like a potters vessel shall
in pieces dash them all.

And ye the judges of the earth
instructed be also.

the LORD your only choice;
With trembling also reverently
at his service rejoice.

be angry still always,
And when his wrath but kindled is,
ye perish from the way;
Most blessed ever are all they
that in their grief and smart
Do constantly on him rely,
and trust with all their heart.
PSALM. III.
LOrd, how are they increased thus
that that sore do trouble me.
They who against me now rise up,
in number many be.

thus of my soul do say,
For him in the almighty GOD,
there is no help always.

My glory, and in troubles great
the lifter of mine head.

And he me heard then by and by
out of his holy hill.

and slept most quietly,
I als awaked, for the LORD
always sustained me.

Of people, that have set themselves

On the check bone: th'ungodlies teeth

PSALM. IV.
O Thou GOD of my righteousness
when I do call give ear,
Enlarged thou have me from distress,

How long will ye love vanity,
and leesing seek to frame?

the ungodly one and all
Has set apart; the LORD will hear
when I unto him call.

and common ye with skill,
With your own heart upon your bed
and be ye always still,

And in the great and mighty Lord
put ye always your trust.

LORD, of thy countenance the light

More then in times their corns and wine

For thou LORD only do me make

PSALM. V.
GIve ear unto my words O Lord,

for I to thee will pray.

Lord hear by thy goodwill;
At morning to thee will I pray
and look up to thee still.

Nor yet evil at any time,

The workers of iniquity,

thou will destroy therefore,
The bloody and deceitful man
God always will abhor.

Thy Temple toward in thy fear
I will thee worship still.

me lead now I thee pray:
Because of foes; before my face
make thou now straight thy way.

Their throat's an open sepulcher

destroy them great and small:
Let them with shame and grief of heart
by their own counsels fall.
Cast them out in the multitude
of their transgressions hie,
For in great wickedness they have
rebelled against thee.

in thee rejoice always,
Let them for joy in every part,
most gladly shout for ay.
Because that thou them by thy hand
defendest as they see.
Let them also that love thy name
be joyful still in thee.

With favor thou as with a shield,

PSALM VI.
O Lord, while thou in anger art,
me then rebuke thou not;
Nor yet me chasten for my sins,
in thy displeasure hot.

for I am weak truly;
O LORD me heal, for all my bones
with pain still vexed be.

Sore vexed even continually,
but thou, O LORD, how long?

my soul distressde and weak,
Oh, save me by thy mighty hand,
even for thy mercies sake.

Who lying dead within the grave,

all night I filled with fears
Do make my bed to swim: my couch
I water with my tears.

It in this case still waxes old
because of all my foes.

For the LORD o^ my weepping now

The LORD the prayer that I make
will lovingly receive.

and vexed sore by thee,
Let them return, and suddenly
ashamed also be.

From all them that me persecute

there is none found at all.

this has been done by me,
Or if at all within my hands,

I ill rewarded so,
Yea, I have him deliv'red that
is without cause my so.

and take it, let him thrust
My life down on the earth, and lay
mine honor in the dust.

my foes rage to withstand,
Awake to judgment, that for me
thou wisely did command.

Return thou for their sakes therefore
on high set over all.

O Lord, als judge thou me;
According to my righteousness,
and mine integrity.

The just man; for the righteous GOD

Which saves by his mighty hand

And God with those that wicked are

He has his bow in anger bent,

Against the persecutors he
his arrows ordained has.

And has conceived a mischief,

And he into the ditch is fallen,

His violent dealing shall come down
on his own pate with speed.

now praise the LORD I will:
And to the name of GOD most high,
I will sing praises still.
PSALM. VIII.
O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
is in the earth thy name
Who have thy glory set above

Because of foes that thou might still

The Moon, and likewise all the Stars,

With glory, and with honor als

And whatsoever of the seas

How excellent in all the earth

WIth my whole heart I will, O Lord

Thy works that are all marveilous,

PSALM XC.
O LORD that art most merciful,
thou by thy saving grace
Even in all generations still
have been our dwelling place.

ere thou the world did frame,
From everlasting thou art GOD
and still shall be the same.

most easily do turn,
And thus thou say, ye frail and weak,
all sons of men return.

in thy presence and sight,
As yesterday when it is past,
and as a watch by night.

as sleep they seem to be,
Like grass they in the morning are,
which growing up we see.

and grows up always;
It in the evening is cut down,
and withreth all away.

consumed great and small,
And also by thy dreadful wrath
sore troubled are we all

before thee thou have set:
In the light of thy countenance
our sins that are secret.

in thy wrath manifold,
We spend our years that are most vain
even as a tale that is told.

and ten years are, we see,
And if by reason of great strength
even fourscore years they be:
Yet is their strength both labor hard
and sorrow great always,
For it by death is soon cut off,
and we do flee away.

thine anger most severe?
Even so is thy consuming wrath
according to thy fear.

so teach us by and by,
That unto wisdom we our hearts
may timously apply.

to anger be so bent?
Concerning us thy servants poor
now let it thee repent.

thy mercies sweet always,
That we all greatly may rejoice,
and glad be all our days.

the days that we have been
By thee afflicted, and the years
wherein we ill have seen.

And show thy glory great unto
their children that thee fear.

Establish our hands work on us,
yea stablish it surely.

Under th^Almighties shadow shall

And from the pestilence likewise

Thou glade shall trust; his truth the sh^e^

Nor for the arrow that is shot
by day while it is light,

in darkness every way.
Nor for the great destruction als
that wastes at the noon day.

and also thousands ten
At thy right hand; but not at all

And of the wicked also thou
the just reward shall see.

which is my sure refuge,
Even the most high for evermore

befall unto thee here,
Nor yet shall any noisome plague
come to thy dwelling near.

he shall give charge always,
That they most safely keep thee still
in all thy lawful ways.

they shall thee bear anon,
Lest thou should dash at unawars

The Lion young and Dragon thou

Because that he has known my Name
