ACT Anent the old Fourteen Shilling Pieces and their halfs. Edinburgh, 12
October. 1696.
O^R SOVEREIGN LORD, with Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parliament, for
removing the difficulty arising to Commerce, by the deficiency of the Weight
of the old Fourteen and Seven Shilling Pieces, the most part, if not all of
them being worn by use and length of time, below the Legal Standart of Coin
within this Kingdom: Statutes and Ordains and Enacts, that all old Fourteen
Shilling Pieces weighting two Drops and twenty seven Grains, and their halfs
weighting proportionally, shall be received at the present current Rate, in all
Payments whatsomever; as also, that all the other old Fourteens and their
halfs, under the said Weight, shall pass in all Payments at the Rate of Three
Pound Four Shilling the Ounce, being a Groat for the Drop. And His Majesty,
with consent foresaid, Ordains the said Pieces to pass, and be received at the
Rate and Weight above-appointed, under the pain of the double of what shall be
refused, to be summarly exacted at the instance, and for the use of the
offerer, by all Judges Ordinary: And ordains all the Inferior Species under the
said Seven Shilling Pieces, to pass as formerly.

Extracted forth of the Records of Parliament by me Alexander Gibson, one of
the Principal Clerks of Session, as having Commission from Charles Earl of
Selkirk, Clerk to His Majesty's Council, Registers and Rolls. AL. GIBSON.
