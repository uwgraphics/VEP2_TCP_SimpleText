Observations upon the ensuing LETTERS.
THe Lords and Commons have commanded these ensuing Letters and Notes to be
Printed, The Copy of a Letter written by the Lord Digby to the Queen, the
tenth of March last, of his own handwriting: An original Letter written to
the Lord Digby, by Master Thomas Elliot, from York the 27. of May last, two
notes of Arms, the one of which is partly His Majesty own hand, both found
among my Lord Digbies papers: In the Letter of the Lord Digby to the Queen, it
may be observed, how he discovers his venomous heart to this Kingdom, in that
malicious censure, that we area Country unworthy of her; unworthy indeed to be
so often designed to ruin and destruction, to be undermined and circumvented
by so many plots and devilish projects of Jesuits and Priests, and other the
most factious and Malignant spirits i^ Christendom; by which we had been often
ruired and destroyed, if God wonderful Mercy had not preserved us: And we call
his divine Maj sty to witness, that we have never done any thing against the
personal safety or Honor of her Majesty, only we have desired to be secured
from such plots, from such mischievous Engines, that they might not have the
favor of the Court, and such a powerful influence, upon his Majesty's
Counsels, as they have had to the extre^me hazard not only of the Civil
Liberty and Peace of the Kingdom; but of that which we hold much dearer then
these, yea then the very being of this Nation, our Religion whereupon depends
the honor of Almighty God and salvation of our souls: Let this Lord, who was
long amongst us, and knew the Grounds of our proceedings and most secret
consultations, produce any thing (if he can) of undutifulnesse, or disrepect to
her Majesty, expressed or intended by us.

Another discovery in the Letter is this, that this Lord conf^sse^h that he
writ to his Majesty with the hardin sse which he thought his ^ff^ires and
^omplexion required, what this was may well be perceived in a Letter from
himself to the Queen, h^r^to^o^e Prin^ed by our direction; his affairs in the
judge^ent of this Lord requir d, ^^a^ he should withdraw himsel^e from his
Parliament, betake himself to some place of streng h, such was the Couns^ll he
then ga^e him, an^ how w^ll it has bin followed every man may p rc ive, but
what his Majesty's complexion requir^d, that may seem a g^e^ter mystery, and
yet this may be c^ll^ct^d out of that Letter, that his M^jestie in the
apprehens on of this Lord, was too ^nc i^able to an Accommodation with his
Parliament, which in a kind of sco^ne in that Letter is called the easy or the
safe way, this com^lexion so bes^eming a good Prince, requir^d such a hardy and
vehement provocation to wrath and war against his Subjects, as this Lord
presumed to express in that Letter, and besides his Tr^a^hery ^o the Kingd^me,
we may herein observe a great degree of i^s^lence and contempt toward ^his
M^j^sty, that he should da^e in a Letter to the Queen to tax his M^jesties
complexion, with so much as mi^dnesse toward his people, must ne^ds be
requir^d such hardy and bold C^unsell.

I^ M^st^r Elliots Letter it may be first observed, that w^ilst his M j^sty
contests with his Parliament for some qu^stionable Pr^r^gatives, concerning the
Commonwealth, his own servants do re^lly deprive him of an undoubted
Prerogative, of being the sovereign disposer of favors and preferments in his
own Family, which this Gentleman does express in that resolution, never to
have any place about his Majesty, but by the Q^eene, and may be further
observed what these desperate C^unsells about the K ng are most afraid of, and
what they think most hurtful to themselves, that his Majesty should be in^l ned
to an accommodation with his people; by this they fear to be undone that is, to
loose that prey, the estates of the Parliament Men, and other good Subjects,
which they have already devoured in their own fancies, and that they expect to
be p^eserved from this undoing by the Queens interposing.

By these two n^tes may be observed, that at the time whilst so many
Declarations were published in his Majesty's Name, with so^emne Protestations
of his Majesty's Intentions of raising only a Guard for his own Person, all
sorts of provision for an Army, were made beyond the Se^s, and this poor
K^^gd^me d^signed to the misery and confusion of War, and under the disguise
of defending the Protestant profession, an Army to be r^ysed in the Intention
of these wicked Counselors, for the suppressing and destruction of the
Protestant Religion.

Mr Elliots Letter to the Lord Digby.
My Lo^d,
YOu have ever been so willing to oblig^, that I cannot disp^ire of your favor
in a business wherein I am much concerned; the King was pleased to employ me
^o London to my Lord Keeper for the S^ales, which though after two hours
consideration he refused, yet being resolved not to be denied, my importunity
at last prevailed, which service the King has declared was so great, that he
has promised a reward equal to it; it may be the King expects I should move
him for some place, which J shall not do, being resolved never to have any but
by the Queen, being already so Infinitely obliged to her for her favors, that I
confess I would owe my being only to her; nor shall I ever value that life I
hold, but as a dept, which I shall ever pay to her commands; the favor which I
desire from your Lordship, is, that you will engage the Queen^ to write to the
King, that he would make me a Groom of his Bedchamber, which since I know it is
so absolutely in her power to do, I shall never think of an other way, for
which favor neither her Majesty nor your Lordship shall ever find a more real
servant for our affairs they are now in so good a condition, that if we are
not undone by harking to an Accommodation, there is nothing else can hurt us,
which I fear the King is too much inclined to but I hope what he shall receive
from the Queen, will make him so resolved, that nothing but a satisfaction
equal to the injuries he has receiv^d, will make him quit the advantage he
now has, which I do not doubt will be the m^anes of bringing your Lordship
quickly hither, where you shall find none more ready to obey your Commands,

Then your most faithful and humble servant, Thomas Ellyot:
York the 27. of May
The Lord DIOBIES Letter to the Queens Maj sty.
Hague, March ^0. 1642. Madam,
IT is the first Contentm^nt that I have been capable of this long time, That
Your Majesty is safely arrived in HOLLAND, Withdrawn from a Country so
unworthy of you.

I should have waited the first upon you, both to have rendered my duty
according to my precedence of obligation above others, and to have enform^d
your M^jestie the timeliest, of the state of this pl^ce, whither you are
coming, both in point of affections and interests, but that th^re she about
such reports that the Parliament has desired your Majesty not to admit me to
your presence, as I dare not presume into it without particular permission. The
ground of their malevolence toward me in this particular, i^ said to b^, upon
some Letters, which they have presumed to open, directed unto your Majesty from
me, which I profess I cannot apprehen^, for I am certain, that I have not
written to your Majesty the least word that can be wrested to an ill sense, by
my greatest enemies, having not so much as mentioned any business to your
Majesty since I left E^gland. To the King I confess I wrote once with that
hardiness which I thought hi^ affai^es and complexion ^equ^red, but that
letter was sent ^y so saf^ hands, an I cannot apprehend the miscarrying of it.
However Mad^^, if my misfortune be so great, as that I must be deprived of the
sole comfort of my li^e of waiting on Your Majesty, and following your
fortunes, I ^ese^ch you, let my doom be so signified unto me, as that I may
retire with the least shame, that well may be, to bewail my unhappiness,
which yet will be supportable, if I may be but assured that inwardly that
generous and Princely heart preserves me the place of

(Madam) Your Majesty's m^st faithful and m st affectionate humble serva^^

True News out of Somersetshire.
SIR,
I Thought good for the satisfaction of Friends in London to signify that we
have bin in the County of Somerset, full of Feare^: but the cloud (God
bethanked, was soon blown over.

The Marquess Harford ca^e on the 25 of July, at the Assizes to Bath; with
^ivers others to execute the Commission of Array, where met him dive^s of our
Co^n y. The ^nd^^ have ng recei^ed a Letter from His Majesty to forward the
Commission, and to give it in change, but be declined that as also the C^mmands
of the House, for declaring it Ill gall, so in his Charge he sailed betwixt
wind and water, very po^i^iquely.

On Thursday following (having received little encouragement at B^^h) the
Commissioners got to Wells, with the Cavaliers, in the interim a^ B^^h, the
Constables of some 21 Hundreds Petitioned the Judge to Declar^ his opinion
concerning the Commission, which with some reluctance, being soundly put to it,
he concluded to be Illegal; and according to a branch of the said Petition, he
appointed the Vot^s often H^^^e^ to be read in open Court, touching the s^id
Commission.

On Friday the Marquess sent for the Sheriff from his attendance on the Judge
to Wells to require his counsel and Assistance (being joined in commission
with them (for the Array) who returned the Marquess this Answer, that he had
received commands from the Parliament not to join but further to suppress
such their proceedings, whose commands he was resolve^ to obey, and further
sent him the Constables petition, with the Judges answer, which with the
unanimous consent of the C ^^^y, to refuse (except some discontented Spirits)
will cool their fu^th^r goi^g on t^erein diverse of the Coun^y have petitioned
him to de^art ^ut of their co^sts. And ^ne Ma^er Str^w^ a Gentleman of con^ a t
fidel^ty to King and Parliament, who in execution of the Militia, and meeting
with the Marquess Hartford, in the execution of the A^^^y showed such courage,
with a few against his many Hors^, which the ^ou t ^y people, se^ing with
admiration, got up their spirits, and so besti^e^ themselv^s, that in short
time, they had tre^^^^e the Marquess pow r, wh^r^u^on he left the place: It
was certain, that if the Commission had taken ^ff ct, the King would have be^n
shortly in our parts, and it was intended to ^he made the Aceldama, you may
communicate this for Truth.

FINIS.
