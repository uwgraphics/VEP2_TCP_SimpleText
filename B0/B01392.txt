This may be printed, R. P.



ARt thou so loyal to thy Love,
then i will the like of kindness show:
There Is no one that I prize above
my young and lively Willy O.
It Is VVilly, VVilly, VVilly O,
the love I bear to Willy O,
All the world shall never know
the love I bear to Willy O.
If I might have Lord, Duke, or Earl,
and in rich Silks and Sattens go,
Likewise adorned with Orient Pearl,
I Would leave it all for VVilly O.
It Is Willy, Willy, Willy O,
the love I bear to Willy O,
All the world shall never know
the love I bear to Willy O.
If to my Father you should ride.
and he should chance to answer no,
Yet I will yield to be the Bride
of thee my Loyal Willy O.
It Is Willy, Willy, Willy O,
the love I bear to Willy O,
All the world shall never know
the love I bear to Willy O.




My Dearest, I have House and Land,
a curious Lamb and breeding You;
With these i will give both heart and hand
to thee my loving Willy O.
It Is Willy, Willy, Willy O,
the love I bear to Willy O,
All the world shall never know
the love I bear to Willy O.
To thee I never will be coy,
behold, mine Eyes like Fountains flow;
It Is with the ecstasy of Joy,
in meeting with my Willy O.
It Is Willy, etc.
In Cards and Dice some takes delight
until it proves their overthrow;
Put thou in Nannys beauty bright
who is in love with Willy O.
It Is Willy, etc.
If thou come to me soon or late,
my love and loyalty i will show;
A boy or man shall always wait
on thee my true-Love Willy O.
It Is Willy, etc.
My dear, that day that we are wed
we will invite all, high and low,
Then i will afford my Maidenhead
to thee my True-Love VVilly O.
It Is Willy, etc.
Against that day a fine Laced Band
upon my Love I will bestow;
There Is no young man in Cumberland
that can compare with VVilly O.
It Is Willy, etc.
My Love, we will make no long delay,
but to the Kirk with speed we will go;
Upon the next high Holiday,
where we will be married, VVilly O.
It Is Willy, Willy, Willy O,
the love I bear to Willy O,
All the world shall never know
the Love I bear to Willy O.
