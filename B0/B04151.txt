THE LONDON Lasses Lamentation:
OR, Her Fear she should never be MARRIED.
To the Tune of I marry and thank ye too.
Licensed according to Order.





ALas! I am in a Rage,
and bitterly weep and cry,
Because I Am nineteen years of age,
yet cannot be married not I.
No Gallant regards my moan,
for Love I am like to dye,
It grieves my Heart to lie alone,
yet cannot be married not I.
Mine, Eyes does like Fountains flow,
as I on my Pillow lie,
There Is none knows what I undergo,
yet cannot be married not I.
There Is Margery, Sue and Kate,
has Husbands with them to lie,
Yet none regards my wretched state,
yet cannot be married not I.




Young Men I must tell ye true,
I scorn to report a Lie,
I am both fair and handsome too,
yet cannot be married not I.
My Father is gray and old,
and surely ever long will dye,
And though he will leave me all his Gold,
I cannot, etc.
Oh! this my Grief and Care,
the which I cannot pass by,
To think I am my Father's Heir,
yet cannot, etc.
I am in Distraction hurled,
and do for a Husband cry,
It Is more to me than all the World,
yet cannot, etc.
I am a poor Lovesick Girl,
and ready with Grief to Dye,
I proffered Jewels, Gold and Pearl,
yet cannot, etc.
I Silks I am still arrayed,
and every new Fashion buy,
Because I am loath to dye a Maid,
yet cannot, etc.
As fine as the Queen of May,
I flourish with gallantry,
I wear my Top-knot every day,
yet cannot, etc.
A paint, and I powder still,
to tempt all that I come nigh,
But yet let me do what I will,
yet cannot, etc.
There Is never a Lass in Town,
for Beauty can me come nigh:
But Fortune she has sent a Frown,
I cannot be married not I.
The Gold which I have in store,
I value no more than Clay,
I Would give all, had I ten times more,
so I might be married to day.
