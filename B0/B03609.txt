A DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUE TEMPLE And Worship of GOD. And Jesus Christ
manifested to be the Head of the Church, which is his Body, and the only
Pastor And also the Members of the Body of Christ, known by their fruits, from
the Synagogue of Antichrist, with a few words to the Roman Catholics.
Likewise the order of the Church in God the Body of Christ made manifest, and
the disorder of the Synagogue of Antichrist.

Given forth in the fear of the Lord, in obedience to his pure will, for the
edification of all people who have any true and simple desires in them, after
the knowledge of the naked, simple truth, as it is in Jesus Christ, by a lover
of the souls of all people, who in contempt and scorn by this dark generation
am called Quaker, known to man by the name of John Harwood.

A Description of the Temple and Worship of God, etc.
The true Church manifested to be the Body of Christ, and not the external
Temples made with hands, and Christ exalted who is Supreme head of his Church,
and the Teacher of the Members of his body, and the end of the first Priesthood.
THE Eternal God, that made the world, and all things therein, Act 17.
who gives life to all living creatures, Acts 7.
dwells not in Temples made with hands, neither is he worshipped with men's
hands, as people may imagine, but the Almighty dreadful God is a Spirit, and
the true worshippers worship him in the Spirit, and so he will be worshipped,
and is and has been so served and worshipped by the true Christians, the
faithful worshippers created anew in Christ, ever since Christ came in the
flesh, the living substance, who prophesied of the deftruction of the Temple,
which Solomon builded for the Service of God in the time of the Law, which
Temple and Service in its time was agreeable to the will of God, being duly and
truly observed, according to the requirings of the Law, and the first
Priesthood, as they stood faithful in the Council of the Lord, their service
and offerings was accepted, but their time was but until Christ came in the
flesh; the everlasting, unchangeable High Priest, in whom the Righteousness of
the Law is fulfilled, who is made a Priest for ever, after the order of
Melchisedech; he puts an end to the (first Priesthood) Law, the carnal
Ordinances, offerings, and outward observations, Rites, and Ceremonies
contained in the Law, which were Types, figures, and shadows, all fulfilled in
Christ the living Substance, the end of the Law and the Prophets, for the
substance, the end of all things, the eternal son of the dreadful God being
come, the shadows and figures cease and end, the first Priesthood, which was
the changeable Priestood, had its time until the coming of Jesus Christ, the
eternal, unchangeable Priest, and then changed, and the Law also: Heb. 7.
And this is he (at whom the whole world is offended, who makes themselves
Priests after the Law of a carnal commandment) who is made high Priest for
ever over the household of God, not made by a carnal (...) of a commandment (as
the Priests of the world are, who receive their orders and Commissions from
man, so made by the will of man but after the power of an endless life, and
they who have not Christ to be their chief Shepherd, and high Priest, are none
of his sheep, nor of the household of God; whatsoever in words may be professed
of him; for there are many that draw nigh with their mouths and lips, but their
heart far from him.

The Law made nothing perfect, as the Scripture of truth, affirms, but Christ
Jesus the substance has by one offering perfected for ever them that be
sanctified; the daily sacrificers the Priests themselves, Heb. 10.
who daily offered sacrifice for themselves and the people in the outward
Temple, according to the Custom of the Law, were not made perfect as
pertaining to the conscience, for that by the works of the Law, no flesh can be
justified, if there had been perfection in the works of the law under the first
Priesthood; what need had there been for a change of the law and the
Priesthood, but not being of force, to make the comers thereunto perfect, nor
the Priests themselves: therefore there was a necessity, for the change of the
law and the Priesthood, Heb. 7.11, 12.
for as says Paul, if there had been perfection by the Leviticall Priesthood
(for under it the people received the law) what further need was there, that
another Priesthood should arise after the order of Melchisedech, and not be
called after the order of Aaron for the Priesthood being changed, there is made
of necessity also a change of the law.

Wherefore I say, all such people, as now go to, and uphold the outward Temple
and Synagogue, and observe the ancient customs, the Rices and Ceremonies
contained in the law; follow the example of the Jews, and the first Priesthood
and their practices, and so goes on in the way where perfection cannot be
actained, nor the light of life received.

It was the labor and practice of the Apostles, the primitive Christians, to
go into the Temple and Synagognes, and to declare against their carnal
Ordinances, weak and beggarly Elements, which had no strength nor power in them
to bring people to perfection, and to call them forth of these things to follow
Jesus Christ, the everlasting unchangeable high Priest, who by one offering
has perfected for ever them that be sanctified, and so many as believed and
received Christ, which the Saints in light preached, left the outward Temple
and worship, and forsook the types, figures, and shadows, and the rudiments of
the world, and followed Christ and they recived the light of life, the
knowledge of God, and in Chirst was created anew, and so became Christians,
forsaking the old way, and following the new, and living way, which all be our
of, Col. 2.20, 21, 22, 23
who uphold the outward Temple and be in the Rudiments of the world, the
carnal Ordinances, and outward observations, whose performances stands in
their own wills and time: take notice, they who continued in the outward
Temple-worship were not called Christians, and though ye Temple worshippers
call your selves Christians, and go under the name of believers in Christ,
nevertheless your practices and fruits manifests the contrary, with the
eternal eye, ye are seen to be in the same nature and life of the Jews and
Infidels, who were enemies to Christ and the primitive Christians, for ye have
but the talk or nimes of Christ and the Saints, our of the nature and life of
the living substance.

The Temple which King Solomon builded, Mat. 24.
Jesus Christ the everlasting unchangeable high Priest, Mar. 13.
foretold the destruction of, and told his Disciples, Luke 21.
that there should not be left one stone upon another, that should not be
thrown down, and after the Prophecy of Christ was fulfilled, the Temple
destroyed, the Scripture of truth does not mention, that ever the Lord
commanded one other to be builded, but the Jews, Scribes, Pharisees and
Infidels, who murdered the just, who were in darkness, upheld the ourward
Temple, and Synagogues (as the truths enemies do now) and have builded many
Temples and Synagogues, following their own imaginations and inventions, and
the Superstitious traditions and Ceremonies of the enemies of Christ, (and the
harmless Christians) not regarding Christ, nor the Doctrine of the Apostles,
who declared against them, and told people in plain words, God dwelt not in
them, as is in the Scripture of truth recorded, Act. 17. Act. 7.
Which shall stand a witness for ever against all their upholders.

And as the Temple-worshippers in former ages were ready to cry up their Temple
and worship, after God had removed his Candlestick from it, even so it is at
this day, they in the Primitive times upheld and cried up the temple-worship,
and services therein, when the Lord was departed out of them, and there was no
life to be found in them; and they persecuted, imprisoned, and shamefully
entreated the Christians in whom was the Life, whose bodies were the Temple of
the living God, and the cryers up, 1 Cor. 3.
and upholders of the idolized houses, the external Temples and Synagogues
(which they call commonly Churches) and the daily services, follows the same
example, though they call themselves by the name of Christians; but your fruits
and practices makes you clearly manifest, ye are as the Jews and unbelievers
were in former ages, without the Life and Power of truth and righteousness,
and enemies to it:

Likewise, the heathenish Idolaters, set up Temples for to worship their
idol-gods in, and they cried up their outward Temple, Act. 19.
the Temples of Diana, Great is the Temple of Diana, and the upholders of the
Temple of Diana was in a great uprore against the Apostle Paul, for declaring
against their abominable superstition and idolatry, and with all their force
and power in a tumultuous manner, resisted the power and life of truth, and
cried up their own idol, as all the Sects and opinions do now, every particular
Sect cries up their own way, but all enemies to the life and power of truth,
and can all agree in one to persecute the Temple of God, in whom the life of
God is made manifest, ye who are gathered into various forms, though in
judgment and opinion ye from one another differ, and be at enmity one against
another: nevertheless in this Nation of England, as well as in other Nations
and Islands ye can join together, and make war against the children of light,
speak and write against the life of truth, and beat, imprison and persecute the
bodies of the Saints, in whom the life and power of truth is manifested, in the
former ages as may be read in the Scriptures of truth, the chief Priests,
Scribes and Pharisees, the Libertines, Sadduces, and Alexandrians, all were
enemies to Christ and the primitive Christians, and even so are the various
formalists in this age, all enemies to the chosen of the Lord, the elect seed,
but it is our joy, that our God has called us unto such an high calling, and
counted us worthy to suffer in innocence for his pure names sake, glory,
honor, praise, and eternal dominion, be given unto our God; all ye dear
innocent Lambs who suffer for Righteousness sake, rejoice and sing praises
unto the Lord our God for ever, the day of your eternal Redemption draws
nigh, your enemies, the enemies of truth and innocence, the Lord our God will
confound and destroy, and through patient suffering we shall all be crowned
with victory, and triumph and rejoice over all Gods enemies for ever. Blessed
are ye for ever who abide the fiery trial, for yours is the dominion for ever;
but who ever shrinks in the time of suffering, when the great day of trial
shall come, shall never reign with Christ the Captain of our salvation, who was
made perfect through suffering; but ye who continue to the end, are blessed for
ever, and shall reign as Kings over all the earth.

And ye Temple-worshippers in this age, manifest your selves to be as blind and
ignorant concerning the mystery of life and salvation, as your forefathers
were, the enemies of truth and righteousness in the former ages, who did not
believe in Christ the substance, who put an end to all types and figures,
though ye pretend ye believe in Christ, and go under the name of Christians;
but all are not Christians that go under that name, for all ye that be from the
light with which Christ Jesus has enlightened you, and deny the light, and
call it a natural light, or a fancy, as many of ye have done, be out of the
way of Truth, Life, Peace, and salvation; for there is no Life, Peace nor
salvation in any other but (...) the true light, which has enlightened every
man that is come into the world, and I say unto you, until you come to own the
light of Christ in you, and it receive to be your guide and leader, you cannot
receive the light of life: the way of life, peace and eternal salvation, the
light will lead you if you believe in it, and receive it to be acted by it,
which will for ever be sealed from you, if ye continue in enmity to it, and
hate, and despise it, and will be your condemnation for ever from the
inheritance of the Righteous: none upon the face of the whole earth can come
into the persect knowledge of the secret mystery of life and salvation, but by
the Light with which Christ has enlightened them; for it is the key of Divine
knowledge, it being owned and received, it will clear and open the
understanding, and give truly to know the secret mystery of eternal life and
salvation, which cannot be attained any other way, but by the light, which is
the eye with which the face of God is seen in Christ, the eternal Divine
substance, in whom all fullness dwells, which Divine secret is hid eternally
from all that deny and refuse the light in them, with which the express image
of the Fathers glorious substance, Christ has enlightened them.

Also I say, all people upon the face of the whole earth, under what name or
Title of Religion soever, that make mention of the name of Jesus Christ, and
are from the light with which the true light Christ has enlightened them, are
out of the nature and life of Christ, and are no true Christians, but are in
the flesh, and brings forth the fruits of the flesh, and such as be in the
flesh be enemies in their minds to Christ, and the true innocent Christians:
the fleshly man in all ages has been, an enemy to the Spiritual man, as in
particular, in the general, the flesh makes war against the Spirit, the fleshly
man against the Spiritual man, and strives with all his might and force to
have the rule over the spiritual man; but thou fleshly man, thy Strength is
the Arm of flesh, and thy weapons of War are carnal, and thou can not
prevail against the man born of the Spirit, for the Lord of hosts is his
strength, who is Mighty and Powerful, who will cut down by the World of his
Power, the Sword of his Mouth, and give him dominion over thee, though thou use
all thy craft and subtle policy, for to bring the spiritual seed under thee,
yet thou shall know that God has decreed the contrary; for this is the day of
the Lords mercy, and the innocent seed, which has long been sore oppressed by
the unrighteous generation of fleshly men, shall now be freed from bondage and
thraldom; and I know the day draws nigh wherein this shall be fulfilled;
though the utmost of your wrath and cruelty, you will manifest, who walk in the
flesh, yet all your striving, plotting, and close combining and unrighteous
decrees, shall stand you in no stead, for the elect seed, according to the
determinate Counsel of the Almighty God shall now be set free, as well from
out ward bondage, as inward, and shall reign and govern in righteousness, over
all the earth for evermore, our God according to his promise, for his elect
sake, will hasten his work, a short work, he will make upon the earth, now woe,
woe, to the oppressors of Sion great will be your misery pain and torment, of
your grief and sorrow there shall be no end; but blessed art thou who art
hated, and despised, persecuted, and shamefully entreated, mocked and scorned,
and not counted worthy to live upon the earth, thy grief and sorrow, shall be
turned into everlasting joy, thou shall sing and be glad, when thy enemies
mourn and lament, thy time of sorrow is come in remembrance with God, and he
will plead thy cause against thy oppressions, and give thee ease and peace for
ever, and over the smoke of their torment shall thou rejoice, and the time
draws night wherein our God will bring this to pass.

Gods people, his Temple; and who they are.
THe Apostle, Paul writes unto the Corinthians in plain words, concerning the
Temple of God; 1 Cor. 3.16.
which might stop the mouths of all the Carnal professors upon the earth, who
call, a stone-house their Church or Temple; if the words were truly weighed and
believed; know ye not (says he) that ye are the Temple of God; and the spirit
of God dwells in you, if any defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy,
for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are, but the whole earth has
been covered with thick darkness, in this long time of Apostasy, that the
understandings of most part of people has been veiled and blinded, that the
knowledge of the truth and life of the holy Scriptures has been sealed from
them, and are to thousands at this day; who make a profession of it; and by
many thousands of people in this Nation and other Nations, the stone houses,
the Idol Temples made with men's hands, are called Churches and Temples; and are
esteemed to be more holy places then others; though the Scripture clearly
manifests to the true understanding Reader, that the people of God are his
Church or Temple; 2 Cor. 6.16.
ye are (says Paul to the Church of Corinth) the Temple of the living God, as
God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; take notice, the people
in whom God dwells and walks are his Temple; but if any of Gods people, whom he
has chosen to be his rabernacle; do now bear restimony of the spirit of life
dwelling in them, it is by this dark generation of people counted presumption,
and by some blasphemy; because it is beyond the reach of their carnal reason
and sensual wisdom, which never shall enter into the true knowledge of this
my stery, god dwelling in man and man dwelling in God; and furthermore, Paul
says to to the Church at Corinth, 1 Cor. 6.19.
what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy Spirit which is in
you? is not this a plain thing, that the people of God are his temple, and
dwelling place, if you will believe the Scriptures, you cannot deny the truth
of this which is so clearly made manifest. And these are Gods, people, who walk
in his light and Counsel, who are borne again of the incorruptible seed, who
have put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new man Christ Jesus,
and this is the same body as ever was; the temple God dwells in; the body
purged from sin and corruption, and this is the eternal tabernacle of God, the
new man, Christ Jesus the same to day yesterday and for ever, but such people
as be in the corruptible nature, not purged nor cleansed from sin and
corruption, are not the holy temple of God; such as bring forth the fruits of
unrighteousness, and has no experience of the in ward work of Gods living
power in them, but are ignorant of the work of repeneration, they be none of
the body of Christ the temple of God, but the Synagogue of Satan, the body of
Antichrist; for it is they and only they, who are (borne of the spirit and
walk after the spirit, (to walk after the spirit is to be led and guided by it)
which brings forth the peaceable fruit of righteousness which knows the
operation of the divine power, and the work of Regeneration wrought in them,
which are the true and only temple of God; ye who are Regenerate, and born
again of the immortal seed, ye are the true Christians body of Christ, temple
of God, and Gods dwelling house and tabernacle, ye babes of God, who through
the eternal spirit, has mortified the Just and Concupiscence of the flesh,
Crucified the old man with his deeds; from whom all old things are passed away;
who are created a new unto good works, ye are the Church of the first borne,
your body is the temple of the eternal God, and he will dwell in you, and make
his abode with you for ever,

The members of the body of Christ known by their fruits from the Synagogue of
Antichrist.
YE who be of the body of Christ, from sin and iniquity are purged and cleansed
through the Spirit, by which ye are baptized into the one body, and ye cannot
bring forth evil fruits, ye are known one of another in the life of innocence,
though the world know ye not, ye are meek, loving and full of tender
compassion, ye cannot render evil for evil to no person, ye are patient and
long suffering, willing freely to forgive them that trespass against you, your
humillity and moderation is manifest to the light in all consciences, ye are
not puffed up with pride and conceitedness, but are low and little in your own
eyes, ye cannot seek after earthly honor or riches, but are contene with what
the Lord provides for you, and ye seek only after honor of God, ye are no
self-lovers, but self-denyers, no followers of the worlds fashions, Customs or
traditions but of Jesus Christ, whose kingdom is not of the world who alone is
your Head, King, Priest and Propher, ye who go under the name of members of
the Church of Christ, and call one another Brother, and Sister, who pretend to
have Communion and fellowship with one another, search your hearts with the
light of Christ, and it will not deceive you, but let you truly see, in what
your fellowship has stood and stands, and will clearly manifest unto you,
whether ye be in the spirit of truth and righteousness yea or no; if ye be,
then the fruits before mentioned ye will bring forth abundantly, which are the
fruits of the spirit, and your Communion and fellowship will stand, and as ye
abide in the life of truth and righteousness, your love and unity will grow and
increase, and your pure lives and holy conversations, will make you manifest to
be members of the body of Christ; but if you see with the light of Christ
self-love, pride, covetousness, rashness, self-wildness, envy and
uncharitableness, then know that if these things remain in you and things of
the like nature, that your Communion and fellowship, is in the flesh and not in
the spirit, formal and not eternal, and ye are none of the living stones which
the temple of God is built on, none of the members of the body of Christ, but
of Antichrist, the body of Christ is washed in his blood which cleanses from
all unrighteousness, unrighteousness, uncleanness, and all sin and iniquity is
out of the body of Christ, the Church in God; in the body of Antichrist, the
enemy of the Church of God; All ye formalists who are puffed up in pride and
arrogance, who have gotten the Saints words to talk on in your airy minds, and
live at ease in vain pleasures and wantonness, your words and policy shall
stand you in no stead, in this the day of the Lord, you shall appear in your
own likeness, your close hypocrisy and your fained humility, shall not cover
you, nor save you from the judgments of the dreadful God, your hearts shall
be made naked and bare; and your reward you shall have, with the wicked and
ungodly, your shame and confusion, ye shall no longer hide, ye shall be known
whose servants and Children ye are, and of what body ye are members, and that
Antichrist is your head, and not Christ, the body of Christ is purged from all
secret deceit, treachery, and close hypocrisy, and is filled with
righteousness, purity and innocence, every particular member of the Church in
God (this pillar and ground of truth) knows the work of sanctification, by the
powerful operation of the word of truth are thoroughly cleansed and sanctified,
and by the divine power joined and united unto Christ the head of his Church
which is his body; he is no member of the Church of Christ what ever he
profess, that lives after the flesh, and knows not the work of the Eternal
Spirit of judgment and burning, which mortifies the fleshly desires and lusts,
and purges and cleanses the heart thoroughly from sin and iniquity; for it is the
work of the spirit to purify, and the body purified without spot, is the body
of Christ, the Church of God, no unclean person can be united to the body of
Christ, though thousands of unclean people, may come amongst the members of his
body, yet no defiled thing can be joined to it, for it is pure without spot,
and members of the Church in God feels, enjoys, one another in the life of pure
love, and their unity and fellowship, stands not in outward formallity; but in
the pure life of truth and innocence, where they meet and embrace one another,
and are refreshed one in another, in the love, and life which changes not;
which all men and women upon the face of the whole earth are out of, which be
from the light, with which Christ has enlightened them; for the light leads
into the life of innocence, where the eternal unity stands.

The Church made of living stones.
THe living stones of which the Church of God is made, are the people who have
passed from death to life, who are dead to sin, and alive unto righteousness,
such as have passed through much sorrow and many tribulations, and has seen the
travail of their souls, and are satisfied with the birth of the immortal seed,
which is borne and brought forth in them; they in whom the righteous seed is
raised, and the unrighteous nature destroyed, which was dead in sin and
transgression, and made alive unto God; and now lives in the light, the life of
righteousness, are the Church of God, the House of God, the tabernacle of the
most high, and in them the Lord of Hosts is sanctified, who will be sanctified
in all that draw nigh unto him; and in ye who are raised up in the life and
power of truth and righteousness is the living praises; for the living praises
God, the dead cannot praise him, the life, which through the operation of the
Eternal spirit is raised, which purges from sin and iniquity glorifies God and
praises God, and these are the living stones on which the Church of God is
builded, who are borne of the immortal seed; whose delight is to walk in the
Counsel of the Lord, and to serve and obey him, which cannot delight in
themselves nor in their own works, and truly it is not grievous to the living
stones, the Babes born of God to follow the Counsel of their Father, for it is
the nature of the seed of God to do the will of him, who has through the
power of his free love and tender mercy begotten it unto himself; ye in whom
the babe immortal is born and brought forth, can seal to the truth of this,
though to many it may seem to be a strange doctrine, who be ignorant of the
work of God, and knows not the birth of the seed immortal; but truly I know
that as John says, that the Commandments of the Lord out God are not grievous
unto us his Children, Ioh. 5.3.
who are begotten and borne of him, but rather joy us, yea it is our joy to
serve the Lord our God, and to keep his pure Commandments, as it was the
delight of his faithful servant David to walk in his Commandments which he
loved; Ps. 119.47.
but who be in the transgression, in the disobedience loves not God, Ver. 143
neither delights in his commands, but loves themselves, their own ways, and
rejoices in their iniquities, and delights in the things which are
perishing, which profits not but such are dead in sin, though alive in the
fleshly body, and are none of the living stones which the Church of God is made
on.

Jesus Christ head of his Church, and the only Pastor.
MAny people there are that in words make a profession of Christ and the
Scriptures, and will say they believe in Christ, yet will not own him to be
their Pastor and chief Shepherd, as the Church in God owned him, and
confessed him, as the Scripture of truth makes manifest, yet account themselves
to be his Church and people; but such as cannot own him to be their teacher and
leader clearly manifests themselves to be none of his flock; for the Sheep of
Christ, know his voice and follow him, and regards not the voice of the
stranger, and they who know his voice, observe his counsel, and follow his
leadings and directions, for how does any man follow Christ, if he do not
hearken to his pure Counsel, and obey what he requires, Christ says himself,
I am the good Shepherd and know my sheep, and am known of mine, and such as
know Christ and are known of him, need no other Pastor or Shepherd, he is
sufficient to guide his own flock, and such as make a profession of him in
words and show outwardly, (as the various formalists do) and will not own him
to be suflicient, without other helps, to teach them the way of life and
salvation, shows that they know him not, for if they knew him, they would know
that there is no salvation in any other, all power and authority is committed
unto the true light Christ Jesus, the everlasting unchangeable high Priest, who
is over the household of God, their head and Pastor, and who are not under his
Scepter and Government, what ever they profess in words of him; they are none
of his subjects, none of his body, none of his Church, but the subjects of
Antichrist; for whose Scepter and Government ye are under, his servants, and
subjects ye are; if Christ govern then are ye guided in the way of truth and
righteousness, which is the strait path which leads to life eternal; and ye
cannot follow the broad path of wickedness and unrighteousness, which leads to
perdition and eternal destruction; for the Church of Christ who are subject to
him, are restrained by his saving power from the evil way, and kept in the
pure way, the way of holiness, for he goes before, and his flock follow him,
and they that follow his leadings cannot err from the way of truth and
holiness, who go on in the ways of wickedness follows not Christ, he does not
go before them but Antichrist, the enemy of Christ he is the King of
unrighteousness, and the wicked his subjects follow him, so that ye who be in
the sin and unrighteousness, and plead for sin remaining in you, so long as ye
live upon the earth, ye are none of the subjects of Christ; for he saves his
people from their sins, Christ is none of your King, Priest nor Prophet, who
are not governed by him and saved from your sins; ye are none of the members of
his body; who be in your sins, the members of his body are purified and
cleansed, without spot or blemish; Take dilligent notice, the Church in God
which is the body of Christ, Ephesians. 5.
is without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, holy and without blemish; and of
this sanctified body, Christ is the Head and Savior, who saves to the utmost
all them that come unto God by him, and such a glorious high Priest becomes
the Church of God, who is able to save and defend them from the power of sin
and Satan, and to present it without spot or fault unto God the Father of
Spirits; who has set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, and
has put all things under his feet, Ephesians. 1.
and has given him to be the Head of his Church which is his body; such people
as choose a man (or men) and set him (or them) up to be their teacher (or
teachers) Christ is not their pastor nor teacher, such as set up man, and
dishonours Christ, ye that choose a man and set him up to be your Head, and
receives Orders and Commissions from him, you go about to take the authority
from Christ, and to rob him of his glory, who in all things ought to have the
pre-eminence, who is the everlasting unchangeable high Priest, in whom there is
no variableness nor shadow of turning, he alone is the Supreme of his Church,
and the members of his body receive orders and directions from him, they know
his voice, and follow his Counsel, and need not seek unto man, so sets not up
man, but Christ to be Supreme Ruler, head and Governor, who is most worthy to
have the Government of his own body, who is over all, God blessed for ever, he
is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, and his Church is the same, the
chaste, pure, holy Virgin, which he has chosen to be his espouse for ever, he
is not espoused, nor will not espouse himself to an harlot, an adulterer, that
follows after other lovers, such as follow their imaginations and inventions,
and loves themselves the world and its glory, such are none of Christ's espouse,
for the Bride, the Lambs wife follows the Lamb, denies the world, its pomp and
glory, and tramples upon all vain traditions, foolish inventions, and earthly
imaginations, and over all the earth reigns, and gives glory to him who redeems
them from the earth.

Therefore all people upon the face of the whole earth who make a profession of
believing in the name of Christ, turn in your minds to his light in you, with
which he has enlightened you, and in it wait patiently, that you may come to
know his saving power, which is nigh you, if ye were but acquainted with it,
which if you cease from man, and your own works and imaginations, and take heed
to the light of Christ in you which show you your thoughts, desires, and evil
deeds, the saving power of his love, you would shortly come to know and feel,
which would rend the vails which has darkened your understandings, and give ye
to see into the secrets of God, the Church in God you would come to know, and
Christ to be the chief Shepherd, the everlasting, unchangeable priest, the
light is the eternal eye which sees and searches into the deep secrets of God,
and ye cannot come to know the true Church, nor the order and Government
thereof, until you come to the light in you and receive it to be your guide,
which light leads to Christ from whence in comes, who reveals and makes known
the deep secret mysteries of life, peace, and eternal salvation, which you can
never attain unto by any other means, for man by reading, studying, praying in
his own will, and observing duties and outward Ordinances, can never find out
the knowledge of God and his secrets; for whatsoever man does in his own will,
and time, is but his own work, and not the work of God, and all men and women
upon the face of the whole earth must cease from their own works, before they
enter into the true rest, the rest prepared for the children of God, which is
in Christ the true light, which enlighteneth every one that comes into the
world in him the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, and all that dwell in
the truth, in the light, in Christ, dwell in peace; for in me says Christ, Ye
have peace; dwell in the light, in Christ, free from the condemning power of
the Law, but out of the light in draknesse, under the condemning power of the
Law, under the curse and wrath of God; this is the way of true knowledge, the
light loving it, and the way of life and peace to all that receive it, to be
their leader, and for ever blessed are they that submit to the Scepter of Jesus
Christ, and continue under his Government unto the end; for they shall have an
inheritance with the righteous generation, in the world which has no end.

A Discovery of the true worship of God, the order of the true Church, and the
Disorder of the Synagogue of Antichrist.
MAny various Forms there are in these our latter days, who all pretend to be
believers in Christ, and call themselves by the names of Christians, yet in
judgment and opinion one differ from another: Yea, in several points,
principles and doctrines, and in the ministration of their ordinances, which
they call the ordinances of Christ, as Baptism, their Sacraments, preaching,
praying, singing of David's conditions, and private duties, as they call them,
which all are performed in their own wills, and in their own times, which will
worship is contrary to the worship of God, and is to perish, as the Scripture
of truth does affirm, as may be read in Colossians the 2. chap. 20, 21, 22, 23
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as
though living in the World are ye subject to Ordinances (touch not, taste not;
handle not, which all are to perish with the using) after the commandments and
doctrines of men, which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship
and humility, and neglecting of the body; Take notice, the will-worshippers
neglect the body which is the substance, and continues in the perishing shadows
which profits not: all the doctrines of men, and carnal ordinances, which
have their rise and foundation from the imagination of the fleshly wisdom, are
to perish, for they are all without life, and all ye various formalists, who
feed upuon such things, feed upon husks, and something there is in you, which
cannot be satisfied with such food, but often shows the emptiness of all your
duties, and self-performances, and will, worship, though you little regard it,
ye are so highly puffed up in the knowledge of what your imaginations has led
you into, and though your Souls famish for want of living bread, yet many of
you are content to take up your rest in these perishing things, which can never
give true satisfaction to the hungry soul, but only nourishes and feeds the
carnal mind, which is enmity to God, and there are all the Forms of Religion
upon the face of the whole earth, who deny the light of Jesus Christ the chief
cornerstone, who is true and sure foundation, in enmity against the truth, and
enemies to the true worshippers, who are builded upon the sure foundation, who
worship God in the Spirit, and in the truth.

Now verily, verily, I say unto you, the truth is but one, the true worship but
one, the true Church which is the body of Christ, but one: the Members of the
body of Christ differ not in any thing but are of one heart, one mind, and one
soul, their doctrine, principles, and way of worship but one, not rent nor
schism in the body of Christ, all divisions, differences, and contrary
judgments, and opinions are in the corrupt, erroneous body of Antichrist,
which is the body of confusion, of whose body all are members who deny the true
light, which Jesus Christ has enlightened them with, which light is the way
out of confusion, into true and perfect union.

The Worship of God.
God is a Spirit, John 4.
and seeks such to worship him who will worship him in the Spirit, and in the
truth, says Christ the Son of God; and the eternal Father commands people to
hear him, This is my beloved Son says the Father of Spirits, hear ye him, but
all ye that be from the Spirit, and out of the light in your imaginations,
following after carnal Ordinances, the doctrine and traditions of man, hearkens
not to the voice of the Son of God, who says, God is a Spirit, and will be
worshipped in Spirit, and in the truth, but rejects the Council of the Son,
and disobeyes the pure command of God the Father, who says, This is my beloved
Son, hear ye him; And all ye Professors upon the face of the whole earth, be
without God, 2 John 9.
who err from and abide not in the Doctrine of Christ the only Son of the
Fathers love: How do ye love the Son of God, that keeps not his saying, but
erres from his councels and Commands, who says God is a Spirit, and will be
worshipped in Spririt, and in the truth, is not this the true way of worship,
which Jesus Christ has prescribed? is there any other way agreeable to the
will of the Father, than the way which his only Son has manifested? who came
not to do his own will, but the will of his Father that sent him, and this is
the will of the Father, to have his people to worship him, in the Spirit, and
in the truth; for so will God be served and worshipped. Therefore all people
take notice, the true service and worship of God is in the Spirit, and in the
truth, and stands not in carnal ordinances, nor extenall shows, neither
consists in outward bowing, Ceremonies, and traditions of men, which is but the
exercise of the body, and the exercise of the body profits nothing, the
living, eternal God, who is pure, just and holy, seeks such worshippers to
worship him, who will worship him in the Spirit, and in the truth, and all
people who be turned to the light of Christ in them, with it are guided, and in
it walk, be in the truth, (the light in truth) and in the Spirit, and in the
truth worshipped the ancient Christians in former ages, received the light, and
were called the children of light, and as they were moved of the Lord, they
exhorted one another to walk in the light, as children of the light, and of the
day, and as they walked in the light, they had fellowship one with another, and
with the Father and the Son, who is light, and in whom is no darkness; take
notice, the fellowship of the Saints is in the light, which is but one, and all
in the light are but one, united by the Father of light, and spirits, and all
people, that receive and abide in the light, walk in the Spirit, and in the
truth, and in the spirit and truth worship God the Father of spirits, but all
that be from the light be out of the truth, out of the spirit, in which God is
worshipped, and worship they know not what, as Jesus Christ told the woman of
Samaria, and said, that neither at Jerusalem, nor at the Mountain of Samaria,
God the Father would be worshipped, John 4.
But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship him;
God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in
truth. Take notice, Jerusalem was the City, where Solomon built a Temple for
the Service and worship of God, according to his Command, and the Mountain of
Samaria was also a place where people worshipped; Nevertheless the Son of God
said, his Father would not be worshipped there, but the true worshippers must
worship the Father in Spirit and in truth; Wherefore I say, all such Teachers
as lead people to the external Temples (which they call Churches) and to the
observation of carnal ordinances, and to follow after the Ordinances vain
traditions, and doctrines of men from the spiritual Worship, are deceivers and
Antichrists, for this same reason, because they teach people to uphold, follow
and observe that which Jesus Christ and his Apostles declared against, and was
never observed nor practiced by the ancient Christians, recorded in the
Scripture of truth for the Primitive Christians, that believed in, and followed
Christ, denied and bare testimony against the outward Temple and Synagogues,
and the customary places upheld by the Jews, and Infidels, and their
traditions, and superstitious ceremonies; Co. 2. Act. 1.13. Act. 20.8 Gal. 5.5
Mat. 18.20
and met together at one another houses, in an upper chamber, or in an inner
room, and waited upon the Lord in his light and counsel, for the manifestation
of his Divine power, and according to his promise they enjoyed the powerful
presence of the Lord, who says, where two or three meet together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them, and when the Saints in light were assembled
together, waiting in the pure fear of the Lord, as any of them were moved of
the Lord, they preached and prayed, and exhorted one another in the fear and
power of the Lord, and none were restrained from speaking, but all had liberty
to speak that had a motion from the Lord, as the Scripture of truth makes
manifest, if any thing were revealed to any one in the Saints Assembly that
sat by, 1 Cor. 11.
the first was to hold his peace, that all might speak one by one, that all
might be edified, this was the order and practice of the Saints in light, the
Church in God, the body of Christ in former ages, and the same order and
practice is in the true Church now at this day in the Assemblies of the
children of light, who are hated and despised of this unrighteous generation,
and in contempt and scorn called Quakers, but reproaches and unrighteous
slanders cast up-upon us by Ishmaels line, we esteen as great riches, and are
not ashamed to suffer for righteousness sake, but all ye various Forms, who
push one at another, and all against the life of truth, ye shall wither as
grass in the heat of of Summer, and fade as a flower, for the virtue and power
of the Almighty ye want amongst you, for to support and uphold you, and the
earth is your Center, and a habitation in God, the life or righteousness ye
have not, but in the earth, and the woe is coming upon the inhabitants of the
earth, therefore, cease, cease from your inventions and airy imaginations, and
fear and dread the pure name of the living God, and worship him, serve him, and
give glory to him, that ye perish not in your iniquities with the ungodly, for
truly the hour of his judgment is come, ye shall all be tried and winnowed,
and the wheat (the good seed) that is amongst you, shall be gathered into the
Lords Garner, and the chaste shall be burned with unquenchable fire, judgment
is alreaready begun at the house of God, where will the ungodly and sinners
appear? now will the terrible Judge of heaven and earth give Sentence against
you hypocrites and dissemblers, Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know
ye not; except ye repent truly, and cease from your sins and iniquities, and
with all your hearts turn unto the Lord God, and dread and fear his holy name,
and walk in his light and counsel, and serve and worship him, as he will be
worshipped, in the spirit, and in the truth, your time prize whilst the door
of mercy is open, lest it be shut against you, and ye in your gainsayings and
Rebellion eternally perish.

To the Roman Catholics.
ANd ye who are called Roman Catholics, are the most dark and ignorant
people, upon the face of the whole earth, that go under the names of
Christians, your whole worship is made up in the imagination and invention of
the wisdom of the flesh, none so foolish but the natural heathen, to bow to
the works of men's hands, in which there is no life, as ye do, and for many of
your Ceremonies, and Traditions, ye have no other foundation, but the natural
Heathen, as one of your own professors does confess, as ye may read in the
587. Page of the Book called the Treasury of the Roman Antiquities, where the
Author expresses many of your Customs and practices in your Religion, and is
not ashamed to say, ye borrowed them of the heathen; as that they hung their
streets with Tapestry, and had resting places in diverse parts of the Towns,
when they went in Procession, as ye have at this day, etc.

And that they carried their images and relics of their gods about, as ye do,
and that they marched two and two together, carrying wax candles or Torches in
their hands, and the same is observed in your Religion, and has been ever
since the Procession was instituted.

And that they went afoot as ye do and when they were encompassed with misery,
they went barefoot, crying and mourning striving to appease the wrath of their
gods, and ye in the time of your great calamities do practice the same
Ceremonies; they ordained supplications and Lectures, that is, public prayers
and service, for more or less of days, and their Temples were full of calves,
and their altars filled with offerings and all the holy places (as the Author
terms them) were filled with people, kneeling and praying (to their Idols) to
their gods, and ye have your Orizons of forty hours, your pardons and Jubilees,
and observe the same Ceremonies, and several other of the Customs and practices
of the Heathen, this Author declares of, and confesses they follow the same
example; and practices the same in their Religion; which truly are such foolish
things, that they are not worth the mentioning; but of this I would have ye
Roman Catholics to take notice; the sure foundation Christ Jesus, is none of
your example, in any of these things, nor your foundation, nor the Apostles,
the Primitive Christians; for Jesus Christ never practiced, nor commanded, any
such things to be observed; therefore if it had not been confessed by one of
your own professors, I had known the rice and foundation of these things;
wherefore I say unto you view your foundation and be ashamed, to take the name
of Christians, and build upon the Heathen, and have no other example for your
Ceremonies and traditions, but the Heathenish Idolaters, own your name
according to your nature and disposition; for the true and Innocent Christian
follows the example of Christ, and has no other foundation, but the chief
corner stone, the true light Christ which has enlightened every man that is
come into the world, and who are built on this sure foundation the rock of
ages, denies and witnesses against all the Customs, Ceremonies, and foolish
traditions of the Heathenish Idolaters, and cannot follow their example in any
thing, but follow the true light Jesus Christ, who gives his followers the
light of life; so that in love to your souls, I desire you to cease from the
customs of the Heathen, from your vain traditions and foolish Ceremonies in
which there is no life, and follow Jesus Christ the everlasting unchangeable
high Priest, for in him is the life, he is the substance, the way, truth, and
life, and in him is the salvation; but no salvation in your ceremonies and vain
traditions; truly my soul pitties you, to see, how you are blinded and kept in
ignorance from the knowledge of the truth, by the spirit of error, which has
long deceived the Nations; and yet are highly conceited of your selves, and of
your Religion; which is made up of foolish and vain imaginations and inventions
of the old crooked Serpent, who through his subtilty has detained and deluded
your Forefathers in the time of Apostasy, and still makes a prey upon you
their successors, who cries up the antiquity of your Religion, as if the long
continuance of it were sufficient to prove it to be the true Religon, but then
the lews, who pretend to be Moses Disciples may plead the antiquity of their
Religion, who are of a longer standing then ye, if antiquity were a sufficient
proof, and they have Scripture for their Temple-offerings and services in the
old Testament; but ye who pretend to be the Disciples of Christ, have no
Scripture in the new Testament for the upholding of your temple, daily
services, ceremonies and traditions; but all such things testified against by
the holy men, which gave the Scripture forth; so that the rise and foundation
of your Religion is the imagination and invention of the sensual wisdom, from
which wisdom the secrets of God and the true Christian Religion is hid; the
Eternal God of power and infinite wisdom, if it be his glorious will open your
eyes, that ye may see the vanity of external things, which ye feed upon; and
bring you to serve him in the spirit, and to worship him in the truth, that you
may no longer feed upon carnal imaginations and inventions, but upon the bread
of life, the substance which is the immortal food, which refreshes and
nourishes the soul up to life eternal.

And all ye forms of Religion under what name or title soever, who set up
teachers amongst you, and will not permit any to speak in your Assemblies, but
such as ye in your own wills set up and appoint, ye are the people who heap to
your selves teachers having Itching ears, ye are out of the order of the Church
in God, where all the members have liberty to speak one by one; in the disorder
and cofusion, which makes you manifest to be of the body of Antichrist, and
not of the body of Christ the true Church; the members of the body of Christ
abide in his doctrine, and follow the example of the true Christians, every
particular member having a word of exhortation, as they are moved of the Lord,
may have free liberty to speak in the Saints Assembly, according to the order
of the Primitive Church, the Church in God; but ye who deny the order of the
true Church, and follow your own ways and imaginations, manifest your disorder,
and shows that ye are our of the true way of God, the true worship of God, in
the false way, and worship ye know not what; my ways says the Lord is not as
the way of man, my thoughts as the thoughts of man; such as follow their own
thoughts, and their own imagined ways goes out of the way of God; the true
light, is the way of God, and in it the will and mind of God is revealed, and
the power manifested which brings the creature into subjection, makes subject
to the requirings of God; and brings to know the true Church the body of
Christ, and the true and perfect order thereof; but this is not a fancy or a
natural light, a thought or an imagination; but a cross to all such things; a
living divine holy substantial principle which manifests thoughts,
imaginations and inventions, and the ground and rise of them, which is the
earthly sensual wisdom; in which God is not known nor served; for God is
light, and in the light and truth is served and worshipped; the children of
light, served God in the spirit, and gloried in Jesus Christ, Phil. 3.
and put no confidence in the flesh; carnal professors, the upholders of
carnal l Ordinances, Rudiments, weak and beggarly elements, are led by their
fleshly imaginations to uphold such shadows without life, and be from the
spirit, the substance in which is the life, wherein God is served and
worshipped; in which the Saints in light served God in the former ages, as in
this age, but the flesh delights in the observation of carnal ordinances,
because they have their rise and foundation from its imagination; and it
glories in what it does invent; but all such glorying is vain; he that
glories let him glory in the truth, in the Lord; and let no man trust to the
arm of flesh, nor put confidence in its imagination, for all that glory in the
flesh, their glory will be turned into shame and confusion; Take notice the end
of fleshly glory is confusion and shame, and ye who are highly pust up and
exalted in your fleshly knowledge and wisdom, God will bring down and abase
and confound, for no flesh shall glory in the pure presence of God; and the
poor in spirit, the meek and lowly in heart, God will raise up and exalt over
all the earth, in this the day of his power, wherein he is bringing great and
mervelous things to pass, which has not been seen in many ages, his own sheep
he will gather into his fold, and them preserve by the arm of his eternal
power, and will scatter and consume the Wolves (who have got the Sheeps
clothing) and all the renting, tearing, ravening and devouring Beasts, which
has rent and torn the Innocent Lambs.

And ye who be in the flesh, in the carnal ordinances, fly to the Magistrates
sword for refuge, which likewise makes you clearly manifest to be out of the
truth and true way of God; for the truth defends it self, and has done in all
ages, it needs not the help of the Magistrates sword, neither did ever the
ancient Christians, who gave forth the Scripture of truth, seek to the
Magistrates to defend them, their weapons were not carnal they fought with but
spiritual, the spirit of truth was their defense, the Magistrates sword (or
the outward Law, the arm of flesh) has been refuge of Antichrist in all ages
as it is at this day, for if any of the servants of the Lord the true
worshippers, who worship him in spirit and in truth be moved of God, to go
into their meeting places (which they call Churches) and in obedience to the
command of God, speak to the Priest, or a word of exhortation to the people,
then cries out both Priest and people hail him away, or words to that purpose,
and calls it disturbance, (to perform the will of the Lord) and goes to the
Magistrates for assistance, and cries away with him, send him to prison or
punish him, this is the practice of the carnal professors who uphold the
external Temple and Synagogues, therefore view your disorder and be ashamed of
such gross and filthy practices; for ye Rulers, Priests and people in England,
in these late years have outstript the Heathen in many ages, in your cruel
persecution; which makes the hearts of the righteous sad, to see such fruits
brought forth in the Nation, where so much liberty in words and writings is
proclaimed for Religion, and honest hearted people, by the supreme in
authority; but woe, woe, from the Almighty unto you, who make the hearts of the
innocent sad, which God has not made sad, a day of torment, and misery is
coming upon you; wherein the righteous shall be glad, which ye have made sad,
and over the smoke of your torment, they shall rejoice, Did ever the Primitive
Christians recorded in the holy Scripture, persecute any prison, whip, burn
with hot Irons, or cast into Dungeons any sort of people, that came into their
Assemblies, is not the Heathen your example, for these things, who persecuted
and shamefully entreated and murdered the Christians, who could not submit to
their unrighteous decrees and unreasonable wills, show one example of cruelty
if you can, from the practice of Christ or his Disciples, if not, number your
selves amongst the Heathen your example for your cruel persecution; is not
cruelty and persecution, a true mark to know the Synagogue of Satan by; from
the body of Christ the Church in God? who in all ages has suffered, but never
persecuted any, but prayed for their enemies which persecuted them, etc.

The order of the Church in God in this age.
THe body of Christ, the Church in God meet together, (as the Saints in light
did in former ages) upon the first days of the week, and upon other days as
the Lord affords opportunity, and wait upon the Lord in his fear and Counsel,
and serve and worship the Lord, in the Spirit and in the truth; and does preach
the word of truth, the everlasting Gospel, and pray and exhort one another as
they are moved of the Lord, and as the holy spirit gives utterance; but not in
the wisdom of the world which is sensual, but in the pure wisdom and power
of God, which by the world is counted foolishness; And this is the true and
only way of God, the true way of worship, and order of the body of Christ, the
Church of God, as the Scripture of truth does make manifest to the
understanding Reader, and according to the doctrine of Christ, the order
doctrine and practice of the ancient holy Christians, which in the Scriptures
of truth are recorded; Romans 6.
who worshipped God not in the oldness of the letter; but newness of spirit,
which is the new and living way, wherein God is and will be served and
worshipped.

I. H.
