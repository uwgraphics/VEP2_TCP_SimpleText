The Royal Health to the Rising Sun.
To the tune of, O my pretty little winking, etc.


AS I was walking forth one day,
I heard distressed people say,
Our Peace and Plenty now is gone,
And we poor people quite undone:
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
The Tempest has endured long,
We must not say, we suffer wrong,
The Queen of Love sits all alone,
No man is Master of his own,
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
We overwhelmed are with grief,
And harbor many private Thief,
Poor Housekeepers can hardly live.
Who used in former times to give:
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
The Thistle choaks the Royal Rose,
And al our bosom friends turned foes,
The Irish Harp is out of tune,
And we God knows undon too soon
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.


TRue love and friendship does now decay,
Poor People's almost starved they say,
Our Trading's spoiled, and all things dear
We may complain, and never the near:
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
Though all be true that here is said,
Kind Contrymen be not dismayed,
For when the worst of harms is past,
We shall have better times at last,
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
When Rulers cast off selfe-respects,
Then shall our Yoaks fall from our Necks,
Our safeties shall not then depend
On promise of a Faithless Friend:
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
When as the Cloud of War is down;
The Royal Sun enjoyes the Crown,
The Lamb shall with the Lion feed,
'Twill be a happy time indeed:
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
Let us cheer up each other then,
And show our selves true English:men,
And not like bloody Wolves and Bears
As we have bin these many years,
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
The Father of our Kingdom's dead,
His Royal Sun from England's fled,
God send all well that Wars may cease,
And we enjoy a happy Peace;
A Royal Health I then begun
Unto the rising of the Sun,
Gallant English Spirits do not thus complain,
The Sun that sets may after rise again.
