TOBIA'S ADVICE, Or, A Remedy for a ranting Young Man.
While you are single you take but little care,
Therefore I say better you married were,
Perhaps there is some at this will make a Jest,
But I say still a married Life is best.
Therefore young men take this Advice of me
Better take one than run to two or three.
Tune of, Daniel Cooper.
By Tobias Bowne.


ON May morning as I walked forth,
I to my self was musing;
Though^ I what a fool am I intruth
that I so long am choosing,
For Maids enough are to be had,
I to my self was thinking,
Sure I will have one good or bad,
to keep me out of drinking.
Yet some there be have said to me,
a single life is gallant;
But where is he that I can see
that lays up any Talant?
They Will say we will live so all our life,
for marriage we will prevent it;
But where is he without a wife
that can live well contented.
For marriage is a thing ordained
and what man can deny it?
If my true-love does constant prove,
I am resolved to try it:
He that does live a single life,
I count a simple action,
But if you get a loving Wife,
that will be satisfaction.
I pray observe what I do speak,
you will say these lines are witty;
How many hearts you cause to break
in Country, Town and City,
And then you think to cast it off,
and turns it to a laughter;
You think that you do well enough,
but pray mark what comes after.




When I was young I did the like,
then I was brisk and bonny;
Sometimes walk abroad all night,
and so spent all my money,
But now I see it is vanity,
i will strive for to prevent it,
I Will go no more to seek a Whore,
I Am with my wife contented.
All you stand by I ask you why
that Marriage should be slighted;
Sure you may say as well as I
youngmen are over-sighted:
But here you run and there you run,
and count your selves brave fellows,
But if that One you had at home,
she would keep you from the Alehouse.
A youngman said that he would wed
but he aimed at promotion;
He fain would have a wife in Bed,
but not without a portion:
I called him fool unto his face,
I did not like his speeches;
Said I, take thou a virtuous Lass,
she is better far than Riches.
If once you get a loving mate,
and you abroad are ranting,
You Will think why shall I stay out late,
my wife she finds me wanting;
I will haste home unto my choice,
she shall not for me tarry:
And if you will take my advice,
I think it good to marry.
And then you may live happily
be but a little thrifty;
Sure if you spend your time away
till you do mount to fifty,
And then a wife you chance to have,
you may become a Father;
You Will say what money might I have saved,
had I been married rather.
And so I bid you all adieu,
I hope you don't deny me,
I do not speak to you or you,
but all that stand here by me,
It Is but a penny once your life,
the Ballad's ready for ye;
And so I wish you a good wife
when that you chance to marry.
