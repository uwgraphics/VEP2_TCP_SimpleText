A PARAPHRASE On the Third PSALM, ENTITLED, A Psalm of DAVID, when he fled
from ABSALOM his Son.
ETernal Monarch, you who are
The Shield of injured Kings, and bear
For all Crowned Heads more than a Common Care,
Behold how they increase who join
To ruin me, how they combine
Against Law Paternal, Regal, and Divine.
So low, so lost, to them I seem,
That now they impiously blaspheme,
And dare to say, his God cannot rescue him.
False, and Profane! he can redress;
He can, He will, it is questionless:
He sees, and will revenge their Wickedness.
On you, my God, I never did call
In vain, what e're did yet befall;
And I am well assured I never shall.
Safe in this Confidence, my Breast
Shall with no Terror be oppressed,
Asleep, or wake, the Almighty guards my rest.
A Hundred Thousand Rebel Foes
My mind shall never discompose,
For my One God is Millions more than those.
Arise O Lord, and let them see
That you have been, and still will be
My inexpugnable Security.
FINIS.
