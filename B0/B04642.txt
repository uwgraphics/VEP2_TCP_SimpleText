OTES'S Remonstrance.
For the Right Honorable Sir Leoline Jenkins Knight His Majesty's Principal
Secretary of State at Whitehall.
I Gave your Honor the last Friday the trouble of a few Lines, in which I told
you, that I had business of Importance with the King and Council; your answer
was, That I must apply my self to a Justice of Peace, or Courts of Justice: The
business I had with the Council, is a Complaint against Roger L'Estrange Esquire
who in several Libels of his called the Observator, and other Seditious
Pamphlets, has (as I humbly conceive,) Vilified and Ridiculed the Evidence of
the Popish Plot, and Arraigned the Proceedings of the Government, upon the said
Plot; And to give himself a reputation in this his Illegal course, he pretends
in one or more of those his said Observators, that he has Authority or leave
from some of His Majesty's Ministers for so doing; which I dare not believe.
Your Honor knows, that His Majesty was so sensible of the danger he was in, by
reason of that Horrid Conspiracy, that he did not only recommend the strict
examination thereof, to His Houses of Parliament, but also was pleased to
acquaint them, how unsafe he was till it was searched out to the bottom.
Besides this, three Fasts were Proclaimed, Appointed and kept, which the King
himself strictly kept, and commanded all His Loving Subjects so to do; several
have been Executed; and several Parliaments have Voted, That there was an
Horrid, Hellish Popish Plot; Now all these things considered, I could never
have imagined that any private Persons, could have been so bold with the
Government, as to use such Reflections upon their Proceedings, and call in
question the Veracity of the Testimony of that Evidence, which was justified by
His Majesty's Council, and the Parliament, and the Courts of Justice; I thought
I should never have lived to have seen the day that the Plot should be called
in question, which the King had owned in his several Proclamations; But since
it is so, I must pray your Pardon, if I cannot apply my self for Redress in
that way and method your Honor was pleased to order: For I humbly conceive
that it is the Government that is abused, and therefore in Conscience and
Honor it is bound to vindicate its Proceedings from such Aspersions as are
cast upon them by the said L'Estrange and his Confederates; I would not use any
method or way to injure the worst of my Enemies, but that the Council will take
my hard usage from the said L'Estrange into serious Consideration, and cause
the said L'Estrange to be Silenced, and Reparation to be made me. To that end,
I have in this sent a Petition to the King and Council, which I would have
presented if I might have had the liberty to appear at Court, in which I pray
for Redress; I hope God will put it into your hearts to do me right. In the
mean time, Sir, I am

Feb. 28. 1683. Your Honors Humble Servant TITUS OTES.
My humble Request is, that this Petition enclosed, may be presented to the
King in Council, so that I may be in some probable way of having Redress.



OTES'S Remonstrance, To the KINGS most Excellent Majesty, and to the Lords and
others of His Majesty's most Honble Privy Council.
The humble Petition and Complaint of Titus Otes
SHOWS,
THat your Petitioner according to his Duty and Allegiance which he owes, and
is always bound to pay to your Majesty and the Government Established by Law,
did in the month of September, in the year 1678. Discover a most Horrid,
Hellish Popish Plot against your Majesty and the Protestant Religion and
Government, to the satisfaction of your Majesty and the Privy Council, as
appears by the several Proclamations issued out by your Majesty's Order, with
the Advice of your most Honorable Privy Council, which your Petitioner is, and
will be ready to produce when thereunto commanded by your Majesty.

That your Majesty was so highly sensible of the great danger your Person was
in, and your Government, by reason of that Conspiracy, that you were graciously
pleased to proclaim several solemn Fasts and days of Humiliation, and did will
and require your Loving Subjects to join in Hearty Prayers and Supplication
with your Majesty unto Almighty God for the Blessings of the Discovery, and for
the farther Discovery thereof; and in several of your Majesty's most gracious
Speeches to your Houses of Parliament, has been pleased to express, How unsafe
your Majesty was till the said Plot was searched to the bottom.

That several of the Conspirators in the Plot were Apprehended, and Committed,
Indicted and Convicted, Attainted, and Executed upon your Petitioners Evidence,
together with the Evidence of others, the Attainders of which Conspirators
remain (as your Petitioner believes) upon Record.

That four several Parliaments owned the same Discovery, and passed several
Votes, wherein they did declare, That there was an Horrid Popish Plot for the
Destruction of your Royal Person and your Government, and the Subversion of the
Protestant Religion as by Law Established

That Roger L'Estrange, whom your Petitioner hears is now a Justice of the
Peace, (though turned out for several Misdemeanors in the year 1680.) has
Defamed and Arraigned the Justice of the Nation, in Ridiculing the said Popish
Plot, and the Discovery and the Discoverers thereof, in certain Scandalous and
Seditious Pamphlets of his called the Observator, and in several other
Pamphlets.

That the said Roger L'Estrange pretends in some of those Seditious and
Scandalous Pamphlets, That he is authorized so to do by one or both your
Secretaries

That the said Scandalous and Seditious Pamphlet, appears to countenance Popery
in your Protestant Government, and the Popish Party have been much encouraged
by the same, to Revile and Threaten your Petitioner; he the said L'Estrange
pretending that he had Authority for so doing.

That your Petitioner has born the Scandalous Reflections and Aspersions, upon
the account of his Discovery of the said Plot, from the said L'Estrange this
four years with Patience; and had the Scandals only touched your Petitioner, I
would not have complained to your Majesty and this Honorable Board; But since
the said L'Estrange Scandalously vilifies the said Discovery, and calls in
question the Justice of your Government, your Petitioner therefore thought it
fit to apply himself to your Majesty and this Board for Redress.

The Premises considered, your Petitioner humbly prays your Majesty, and this
Right Honorable Board, to Relieve your Petitioner, and his Evidence from the
Seditious Calumnies of the said Roger L'Estrange, and not suffer your
Petitioner to be left, to be daily oppressed and destroyed for those Services,
which your Majesty, and Council, and Parliament, and Courts of Justice have
owned: And your Petitioner shall (as in duty bound) pray for your Majesty's
Health, and long Life, and happy Reign, etc.

Titus Otes.
