IT is a noise of terror,
to hear the Guns like thunder,
and a like unjust,
to maintain lust,
and Pride by lawless plunder,
This trade has long been used,
to many a man's undoing,
from this when Peace,
does us release,
our gratitude then shooing.
Needs we must drink this good heal^^

The second part,
To the same Tune.


Junes Predictions.
THey from the Dane do look for aid,
Thinking to make England affrayd;
Kings, Bishops, and Deans Lands are sold,
Yet still we want Silver and Gold;
For some there are that coin keeps back,
Which makes the Soldier for to lack,
For good, let none with ill requite,
Some show their teeth, it is feared they will bite.
Julies Predictions.
Ses-fights in many parts will be,
From which no Nation scarce is free;
New treacheries they do abound,
Which amongst many will be found,
And Jockey will be troublesome,
But we again shall whip him home,
War, with Sedition, and bloodshed,
In many parts abroad is spread.
Augusts Predictions.
The entrance of an Enemy,
Amongst us now abroad does ^ite,
Of Government some makes a toy;
And would our Nation quite destroy:
Some in command do things not right,
Which will be quickly brought to light,
Let Scot or Devil their wits try,
Yet we shall have the Victory.
Septembers Predictions.
Now the Foundation it is laid
Of Englands freedom, as it is said;
Ireland and Scotland cry alack,
For one or both will go to wrake:
Our Merchants ships may have some loss
But they will their proceedings cross;
The City will be out of square,
About an unthought of Lord Mayor.
Octobers Predictions.
For want of Money some do cry,
And I believe they both not lie;
About Religion, our Divines
In Unity and Love now joins,
The Irish Nobles and Gentry
Their Bread begs in a strange Country,
A just reward does light on them,
For murdering our dear Countrymen.
Novembers Predictions.
Now there is mutation in the Law,
Or else some Judges have a flaw,
And there are some with anger swell,
But we do hope all will be well:
And such as ruined the Poor,
They shall be lop't and grow no more;
Great storms will be at Sea and Land
what God does please, who can withstand,
Decembers Predictions.
Complaints against Public Officers,
The People now their Bills preferrs,
Which store of Treasure up did lay,
Against a wet and stormy day:
And such as did descention breed,
Due Justice against them shall proceed,
And thus I do conclude the Year,
Send peace sweet Christ our savior dear.
FINIS.
