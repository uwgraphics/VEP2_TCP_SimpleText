TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY: The humble Petition of the Lords and
Commons in Parliament assembled.
YOur Majesty's most humble and faithful Subjects, the Lords and Commons
assembled in Parliament, have lately received a Petition from a great number of
the Gentry, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants of the County of York,
assembled there, by Your Majesty's Command, the third of June; wherein they
declare unto Us, That having taken a Resolution to address themselves unto
your Majesty, in the humble way of a Petition for the redress of those
Grievances which they now lie under, they were violently interrupted and
affronted therein by the Earl of Linsey, the Lord Savile, and others; and,
notwithstanding all the means they could use to present their just desires to
your Majesty, yet they could not prevail with your Majesty to accept of their
Petition, the Copy whereof they have sent to Us, with an humble desire, That
we would take such course therein, as may tend to the preservation of their
Liberties, and the Peace of the Kingdom; and that we would address our selves
to your Majesty in their behalf, that by our means their desires may find
better acceptance with your Majesty. Whereupon, having seriously weighed and
considered the particulars of those their complaints and desires, as they are
laid down in their Petition, and finding that the Grievances they complain of,
are the increase of the miseries formerly sustained by that County (which has
well-nigh, for three years last past, been the tragical Stage of Armies and
War) by reason of your Majesty's distance in Residence, and difference in
Councels from your great Council, the Parliament, begetting great distempers
and distractions throughout the Kingdom, and especially in that County; The
drawing to those parts great numbers of discontented persons, that may too
justly be feared, do affect the public ruin for their private advantage; The
drawing together of many Companies of the Trained Bands, and others both Horse
and Foot of that County, and retaining multitudes of Commanders and Cavaliers
from other parts; The daily resort of Recusants to your Majesty's Court at
York; The great preparations of Arms, and other warlike Provisions, to the
great terror and amazement of your Majesty's peaceable Subjects, and causing a
great decay of Trade and Commerce amongst them; All and every of which
particulars are against the Law, which your Majesty has made so many, and so
frequent professions to uphold and maintain: And the Lords and Commons finding,
on the other side, their humble desires to be, That your Majesty would hearken
to your Parliament, and declining all other Councels whatsoever, unite your
Confidence to your Parliament; And that your Majesty would not divide your
Subjects joynt-duty to your Majesty, the Parliament and Kingdom, nor destroy
the essence of your great Council and highest Court, by subjecting the
Determinations and Counsels thereof to the counsels and opinions of any private
persons whatsoever; That your Majesty having passed an Act, That this
Parliament shall not be dissolved but by Act of Parliament, your Majesty would
not do any thing tending thereunto, by commanding away the Lords and great
Officers, whose attendance is necessary thereunto; That your Majesty having
expressed your confidence in the Affections of that County, you would please to
dismiss your extraordinary Guards, and the Cavaliers, and others of that
quality, who seem to have little interest or affection to the public good,
their language and behavior speaking nothing but division and war, and their
advantage consisting in that which is most destructive to others: And lastly,
That in such Consultations and Propositions as your Majesty makes to that
County, such may not be thrust upon them, as Men of that County, that neither
by their Fortune or Residence are any part of it: All which their humble and
most just desires, being according to Law, which your Majesty has so often
declared should be the Measure and Rule of your Government and Actions: And we,
your Majesty's most faith^full Subjects the Lords and Commons fully concurring
with the Gentlemen and others of the County of York, in their Assurance that
those desires of theirs will abundantly redound to the Glory of God, the honor
and safety of your Majesty, the good of your Posterity, and the Peace and
prosperity of this Kingdom:

We humbly beseech your Majesty graciously to hearken unto them, and to grant
them; And that you would join with your Parliament in a speedy and effectual
course for the preservation of their Liberties, and the Peace of the Kingdom;
which duty, as we are now called upon by that County to discharge, so do we
stand engaged to God and Man for the performance thereof, by the Trust reposed
in us, and by our solemn Vow and Protestation. And your Majesty, together with
us, stands engaged by the like Obligation or Trust, and of an Oath, besides the
many and earnest Professions and Protestations, which your Majesty has made to
this purpose to your whole Kingdom in general, and to that County in
particular, the Peace and quiet of the Kingdom, (as is well observed by those
Gentlemen, and Freeholders of Yorkshire, in their Petition) being the only
visible means, under God, wherein consists the Preservation of the Protestant
Religion, the Redemption of our brethren in Ireland, and the happiness and
prosperity of your Majesty, and of all your Dominions.

His Majesty's Answer to the aforesaid Petition.
HIs Majesty having carefully weighed the matter of this Petition, presented
to Him at York, on Friday the seventeenth of June, by the Lord Howard, Sir Hugh
Cholmcley, and Sir Philip Stapleton, though he might refer the Petitioners to
his two last Declarations, wherein most of the particulars of this Petition are
fully answered, or might refuse to give any Answer at all, till He had received
satisfaction in those high Indignities He has so often complained of, and
demanded Justice for: Yet that all the world may see how desirous His Majesty
is to leave no Act, which seems to carry the Reputation of both His Houses of
Parliament, and in the least degree to reflect upon His Majesty's Justice and
Honor unanswered, He is graciously pleased to return this Answer:

THat if the Petition mentioned to be presented to both Houses of Parliament,
had been annexed to this now delivered to Him, His Majesty might have
discerned the number and the quality of the Petitioners, which His Majesty
has great reason to believe, was not in truth so considerable as is pretended;
for his Majesty assures you, That He has never refused any Petition so
attested as that would be thought to be. But His Majesty well remembers, That
on the third of June, when there was, upon His Majesty's Summons, the greatest
and the most cheerful concourse of people that ever was beheld of one County,
appearing before Him at York, a Gentleman (one Sir Thomas Fayrefax) offered, in
that great Confluence, a Petition to His Majesty, which His Majesty seeing to
be avowed by no man but himself, and the general and universal Acclamations
of the people seeming to disclaim it, did not receive, conceiving it not to be
of so public a nature as to be fit to be presented or received in that place:
And His Majesty is most consident (and in that must appeal to those who were
then present) that what ever the substance of that Petition was, it was not
consented to by any considerable number of Gentry or Freeholders of this
County; but solicited by a few, mean, inconsiderable persons, and disliked and
visibly discountenanced by the great body of the known Gentry, Clergy, and
Inhabitants of this whole County. And if the matter of that Petition were such
as is suggested in this, His Majesty has great reason to believe it was
framed and contrived (as many others of such nature have been) in London, not
in Yorkshire. For sure no Gentleman of quality and understanding, of this
County, would talk of his great preparations of Arms, and other warlike
Provisions, to the great terror and amazement of His peaceable Subjects, when
they are witnesses of the violent taking His Arms from Him, and stopping all
ways for bringing more to Him; And if there were no greater terror and
amazement of His Majesty's peaceable Subjects in other places by such
preparations and provisions, there would be no more cause to complain of a
great decay of Trade and Commerce there, then is in this place: But His
Majesty has so great an assurance of the fidelity and general affections of
His good Subjects of this County (which He hopes will prove exemplar over His
whole Kingdom) that He has great cause to believe, That they do rather
complain of His Majesty's confidence, and of His slownesse, that whilst there
is such endeavor abroad to raise Horse, and to provide Arms against His
Majesty, and that endeavor put in execution, His Majesty trusts so much to
the Justice of His cause, and the affections of his people, and neglects to
provide strength to assist that Justice, and to protect those affections. For
any affronts offered by the Earl of Lindsey and the Lord Savile, to those who
intended to petition His Majesty, His Majesty wishes that both His Houses of
Parliament would have examined that Information, and the credit of the
Informers, with that gravity and deliberation, as in cases which concern the
Innocence and Honor of persons of such quality has been accustomed, before
they had proscribed two Peers of the Realm, and exposed them (as much as in
them lay) to the rage and fury of the people, under the Character of being
Enemies to the Commonwealth, a brand newly found out (and of no legal
signification) to incense the people by, and with which the simplicity of
former times was not acquainted: And then His Majesty has some reason to
believe they would have found themselves as much abused in the report
concerning those Lords, as he is sure they are in those which tell them of the
resort of great numbers of discontented persons to Him, and of the other
particulars, mentioned to be in that Petition: Whereas they who observe what
resort is here to His Majesty, well know it to be of the prime Gentlemen of
all the Counties in England, whom nothing but the love of Religion, the care of
the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, besides their affection to His Person,
could engage into great journeys, trouble, and expense, men of as precious
reputation, and as exemplary lives as this Nation has any; whole assistance
His Majesty knows He must not exped, if He should have the least design
against Honor and Justice; and such witnesses His Majestje desires to have of
all His actions.

For the declining all other Councels, and the uniting His Confidence to His
Parliament, His Majesty desires both His Houses of Parliament seriously and
sadly to consider, That it is not the name of a great or little Council that
makes the Results of that Council Just or Unjust, Neither can the Imputation
upon His Majesty, of not being advised by His Parliament, (especially since all
their Actions, and all their Orders are exposed to the public view) long
mis-lead His good Subjects, except in truth they see some particular found
Advice, necessary to the Peace and Happiness of the Commonwealth,
dis-esteemed by His Majesty; and such an Instance He is most assured, neither
can, nor shall be given: And that they will think it merit in His Majesty, from
the Commonwealth, to reject such Counsel as would persuade Him to make Himself
none of the Three Estates, by giving up His negative voice, to allow them a
Power superior to that which the Law has given Him, whenever it pleases
the Major part, present, of both Houses, to say, That He does not discharge His
Trust, as He ought, and to subject His, and His Subjects unquestionable Right
and Propriety to their Votes, without, and against Law, upon the mere pretense
of necessity. And His Majesty must appeal to all the world, who it is that
endeavors to divide the joynt-duty of His Subjects; His Majesty, who requires
nothing but what their own duty, guided by the infallible Rule of the Law,
leads them to do; or they, who by Orders and Votes (opposite and contradictory
to Law, Custom, President, and Reason) so confound the Affections and
Understandings of His good Subjects, that they know not how to behave
themselves with Honesty and Safety, whilst their Conscience will not suffer
them to submit to the one, nor their Security to apply themselves to the other.

It is not the bare saying, That His Majesty's Actions are against the Law
(with which he is reproched in this Petition, as if He departed from His often
Protestations to that purpose must conclude Him, there being no one such
particular in that Petition alleged, of which His Majesty is in the least
degree guilty: Whether the same reverence and esteem be paid by you to the Law,
(except your own Votes be judge) needs no other evidence then those many, very
many Orders published in print, both concerning the Church and State, those
long imprisonments of several persons, without hearing them, upon general
information, and the great unlimited Fees to your Officers, worse then the
imprisonment, and the Arbitrary Censure upon them when they are admitted to be
heard; let the Law be judge by whom it is violated.

For that part of the Petition which seems to accuse His Majesty of a purpose
to dissolve this Parliament (contrary to the Act for the Continuance) by
commanding away the Lords and great Officers, whole attendance is necessary,
which His Majesty well knows to be a new Calumny, by which the grand
Contrivers of ruin for the State, hope to seduce the minds of the People from
their Affection to, or into Jealousy of his Majesty, as if He meant this way
to bring this Parliament (which may be the case of all Parliaments) to nothing:
It is not possible for His Majesty more to express his Affection to, and his
Resolution for the Freedom, Liberty, and frequency of Parliaments, then He
has done: And who ever considers how visible it must be to His Majesty, That
it is impossible for Him to subsist, without the Affections of His people, and
that those Affections cannot possibly be preserved, or made use of, but by
Parliaments, cannot give the least credit, or have the least suspicion, that
his Majesty would choose any other way to the happiness He desires for Himself
and His Posterity, but by Parliaments.

But for His calling the Lords hither, or any others absenting themselves, who
have not been called; whoever considers the Tumults (which no Votes or
Declaration can make to be no Tumults) by which His Majesty was driven away,
and many Members of either House in danger of their lives; The demanding the
names of those Lords who would not consent to their Propositions by Message
from the House of Commons, delivered at the Bar by Matter Hollis, with that
most tumultuous Petition in the name of many thousands (among many other of the
same kind) directed to the House of Commons, and sent up by them to the House
of Lords, taking notice of the prevalencie of a Malignant faction which made
abortive all their good Motions, which tended to the Peace and Tranquillity of
the Kingdom, desiring, That those noble Worthies of the House of Peers, who
concurred with them in their happy Votes, might be earnestly desired to join
with that honorable House, and to sit and Vote as one entire Body; professing.
That unless some speedy remedy were taken for the removal of all such
Obstructions as hindered the happy progress of their great endeavors, their
Petitioners should not rest in quietness, but should be enforced to lay hold
on the next remedy which was at hand to remove the disturbers of their Peace,
and (want and necessity breaking the bounds of modesty) not to leave any
means unassayed for their relief; Adding, that the cry of the poor and needy
was, That such persons who were the Obstacles of their peace, and hinderers of
the happy proceedings of this Parliament, might be forthwith publicly
declared, whose removal, they conceived, would put a period to these
distractions, Upon which, a great number of Lords departing, the Vote, in order
to the Ordinance concerning the Militia, was immediately passed, though it had
been twice before put to the question and rejected by the Votes of much the
major part of that House. And who ever considers the strange Orders, Votes and
Declarations which have since passed, to which whosoever would not consent,
that is, with freedom and liberty of Language profess against, was in danger
of censure and imprisonment, will not blame Our care in sending for them, or
theirs in coming, or absenting themselves from being involved in such
Conclusions. Neither will it be any objection that they stayed there long after
any tumults were, and therefore that the tumults drove them not away. If every
day produced Orders and Resolutions as illegal as, and indeed, but the effects
of the tumults, there was no cause to doubt the same power would be ready to
prevent any opposition to those Orders after they were made, which had made way
and preparation for the proposition of them, and so whosoever conceived himself
in danger of future tumults (against which there is not the least provision)
was driven away by those which were past. And his Majesty has more reason to
wonder at those who stay behind, after all His legal Power is voted from him,
and all the people told, That He might be with modesty and duty enough deposed,
then any man has at those who have been willing to withdraw themselves from
the place where such desperate and dangerous Positions are avowed. Which his
Majesty does not mention, with the least thought of lessening the power or
validity of any Act to which He has given his Assent this Parliament, al and
every of which He shall as inviolably observe, as He looks to have his own
rights preserved, but to show by what means so many strange Orders have of late
been made; and to show how earnestly his Majesty desires to be present at, and
receive advice from both Houses of Parliament, (against whom it shall never be
in the power of a Malignant party to incense his Majesty) his Majesty again
offers his Consent, That both Houses may be adjourned to another place which
may be thought convenient, where his Majesty will be present, and doubts not
but the Members of either House will make a full Appearance, and even the
intermission which must attend such an adjournment, may not be the least means
of recovering that temper which is necessary for such debates.

And this His Majesty conceives to be so very necessary, that if the Minds and
Inclinations of every Member of either House were equally composed, the License
is so great, that the mean People about London and the Suburbs have taken, that
both for the Liberty and Dignity of Parliament, that Convention for a time
should be in another place. And sure, how much soever the safety and security
of this Kingdom depends on Parliaments, it will never be thought, that those
Parliaments must of necessity be at Westminster.

His Majesty's Confidence is no less then He has expressed, (and has great
Cause to express) in the Affections of this County, an instance of which
Affections all men know, His Guard (which is not extraordinary) to be, and
wonders that such a Legal Guard, at His own charge, for His Person, (within
twenty Miles of a Rebellion, and of an Army in Pay against Him) should be
objected by those, who for so many Months, and in a Place of known, and
confessed Security, have without and against Law, kept a guard for themselves,
at the Charge of the Commonwealth, and upon that stock of money which was
given for the Relief of the miserable and bleeding Condition of Ireland, or the
payment of the great debt due to Our Kingdom of Scotland.

For the Resort of Papists to the Court, his Majesty's great Care for the
prevention thereof, is notoriously known; That when he was informed two or
three of His intended Guard were of that Religion, He gave special direction,
with expressions of His displeasure, That they should be immediately
discharged, and provided that no Person should attend on Him under that
Relation, but such as took the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; That He
commanded the Sheriff to proceed with all severity, according to the Law,
against all Papists that should come within five Miles of the Court; and if,
notwithstanding this, there be any Papists near the Court, (which his Majesty
assures you He knows not, nor has heard, but by this Petition) He does hereby
command them to depart; and declares to all Officers and Ministers of Justice,
that they shall proceed strictly against them, according to the Law, and as
they will answer the contrary at their perils.

For the language and behavior of the Cavaliers (a word, by what mistake
soever it seems, much in disfavour) there has not been the least Complaint
here; and therefore it is probable the fault was not found in this County.
Neither can his Majesty imagine what is meant by the mention of any men thrust
upon them, in such Consultations and Propositions as his Majesty makes to this
County, who are neither by their Fortune or Residence any part of it, and
therefore can make no Answer to it.

To conclude, his Majesty assures you, He has never refused to receive any
Petition, (whether you have or no, your selves best know) and wills you to
consider what reputation it will be to you of Justice or Ingenuity to receive
all Petitions, how senseless and scandalous soever, of one kind, under the
pretense of understanding the good peoples minds and affections, and not only
refuse the Petition, but punish the Petitioners of another kind, under color,
That it is a Crime, That they are not satisfied with your sense; as if you were
only trusted by the people of one opinion, to take all pains to publish and
print Petitions which agree with your wishes, though they were never presented,
and to use the same Industry and Authority to keep those that indeed were
presented and avowed, from being published (though by Our own Authority)
because the Argument is not pleasant to you; to pretend impartiality a^^
infallibility, and to express the greatest Passion and Affection in the Order
of your Proceeding, and no less error and misunderstanding in your Judgments
and Resolutions.

He does remember well the Obligation of his Trust, and of his Oath, and
desires that you will do so too, and your own solemn Vow and Protestation, and
then you will not only think it convenient, but necessary to give his Majesty
a full reparation for all the Scandals laid upon him, and all the scandalous
Positions made against him; and that it is less dishonor to retract Errors,
then by avowing to confess the Malice of them, and will see this to be the
surest way for the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the redemption of
your Brethren in Ireland, the happiness and prosperity of your selves, and all
our Dominions, and of the dignity and freedom of Parliament.

FINIS.
