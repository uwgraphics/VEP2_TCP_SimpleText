JAMES by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender
of the Faith,
To all and sundry our good and loving Subjects, to whose knowledge these
presents shall come, Greeting,
Forasmuch, as We having granted a Commission of Fire and Sword to the Lord of
Mcintosh, for recovering possession of his Lands of Keapoch, and others
detained from him illegally by Coll Mcdonald and his Adherents; and having
joined with the Lord of Mcintosh, a Company of Our Forces under the Command of
Captain Mckenzie of Suddy, the said Coll having associat to himself all the
Outlaws, and other desperate Thieves and Robbers bearing the surname of
Mcdonald, and others their Associats and Accomplices, to the number of seven or
eight hundred men; they did in a most treasonable and rebellious manner, dare
to Invade and Surprise such as were clothed with Our Authority, and to Murder
and Assassinat many of them: And We being fully Resolved in all cases to defend
and maintain Our Subject; in their just Rights, Properties and Possessions, and
to punish severely such as either oppose Our Authority, or injure them; We have
thought fit and necessary to Commissionat others of Our Forces, under the
Command of Captain Charles Straiton, to repair to the said place, and to reduce
by all possible means and methods the said Rebels, and to require the Chiefs
of all the Neighboring Clanns to be ready, with such numbers of their Clanns,
Friends, and Followers, as shall be desired and required to assist them in the
way and manner expressed in Our respective Letters to them; And for the more
speedy and effectual suppressing of the said Rebels, We do hereby Declare,
that whoever shall Maintain, Harbor, or Resett them, by themselves or others,
give the least Assistance, by Meat, Drink, Money, or any other Supply, or shall
omit to do their outmost endeavor for apprehending them, or shall any manner
of way Intercommune with them, shall be punished as accessories to their Crimes
and Accomplices thereof, with the outmost severity of Our Laws. We do also
hereby Order and Command all the said Chiefs of Clanns, Heretors, Wodsetters,
Liferenters; Tacksmen, Chamberlains and others, Bordering upon any part of Our
Seas, Firths, or Isles, to secure all their Boats and Passages, to the end none
of the said Traitors be Ferried over, and that as they shall be answerable
upon their highest peril. And for the better prosecution of all the said ends
and designs, We hereby Discharge any of Our Subjects to travel in the
High-lands without Passes from their Landlords and Masters, and that ay and
while the said Rebels be fully reduced: Impowering hereby any having
Commission from Us, or any under their Command, to seize and apprehend such as
want Passes, ay and till they be able to give a sufficient account of
themselves. Expecting that all Our good Subjects will concur in suppressing
and rooting out the said Barbarous and Inhumane Traitors to their outmost
power, which We will look upon as most acceptable service; Indemnifying hereby
fully all such who shall act or concur in the prosecution of this Our
Proclamation. And to the end Our Royal Pleasure in the Premises may be made
public and known, Our Will is, and We Charge you strictly, and Command that
incontinent these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh,
and whole remanent Mercat-Crosses of the Head Burghs of the Shires of this
Kingdom, and other places needful, and there in Our Name and Authority make
Publication of Our Royal Pleasure in the Premises, that none pretend ignorance.

Given under Our Signet at Edinburgh, the Fifteenth day of August, One thousand
six hundred eighty eight Years; and of Our Reign the Fourth Year. Per Actum
Dominorum Secreti Concilii. COLIN Mc KENZIE Cls. Sti. Concilii.
